Percolation experiment inconclusive (p=0.605 >> 0.05 threshold).
Root causes: (1) Grid resolution insufficient (16^3 = 4,096 cells, only 1 channel detected which is full z-slice),
(2) Lambda parameter saturated (5.0 compresses viscosity range),
(3) Percolation detection insensitive (BFS mean+1.5*std detects single massive blob instead of multiple channels),
(4) Effect size tiny (3.3% difference: 0.351 vs 0.348 mean frustration).

DEFER to Phase 2 for re-parametrization (grid upscaling, lambda sweep, improved percolation algorithm).
PROMOTE STPT-006 (scalar-TOV Cassini gates) as PRIMARY Thesis 1 validator.
