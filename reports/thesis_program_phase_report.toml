[what_changed]
summary = "Re-ran strict workspace gates, fixed governance classification and schema overlay drift, captured fresh CUDA equivalence evidence, published a 30-task hypergranular execution plan, and removed an unmanaged markdown owner-map blocker."

[why_changed]
summary = "Governance strict mode initially rejected unbacked markdown ownership and then stale registry signatures after requirements overlays changed; both blockers were resolved."

[[why_changed.reason]]
id = "R-001"
detail = "markdown inventory builder lacked destination mapping for crates/lbm_3d_cuda/README.md, producing classification=unbacked_manual_markdown."

[[why_changed.reason]]
id = "R-002"
detail = "GPU/CPU parity had previously shown catastrophic divergence in user-provided logs; re-audit was required to establish current executable truth."

[[why_changed.reason]]
id = "R-003"
detail = "requirements/module_requirements and schema_signatures overlays drifted after batch updates; regenerated Wave5 Batch3/Batch4 registries to restore schema verification."

[[why_changed.reason]]
id = "R-004"
detail = "A stray unmanaged markdown benchmark file in docs/ failed markdown owner-map governance; moved to archive artifact lane as plain text."

[validation_run]
summary = "Mandatory and governance gates pass in current working tree, including a fresh full-stack strict rerun and prior remote synchronization evidence."

[open_risks]
summary = "Primary remaining risk is dependency/porting governance and license constraints, not local build health."

[[open_risks.item]]
id = "RK-001"
severity = "medium"
detail = "Main branch remains heavily dirty with mixed prior edits; reviewability and provenance are reduced until change batches are commit-partitioned."
mitigation = "Stage and commit in bounded thematic batches with report-linked evidence per batch."

[[open_risks.item]]
id = "RK-002"
severity = "medium"
detail = "Cross-repo direct porting is blocked by GPL/no-license compatibility for some candidate repositories."
mitigation = "Enforce clean-room pure-Rust reimplementation boundary until licensing is explicitly cleared."
