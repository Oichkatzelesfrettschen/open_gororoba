# Claims Batch Backlog (C-301..C-350) (2026-02-02)

Purpose: planning snapshot for claim-by-claim audits (not evidence).

- Matrix: `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`
- Domain map: `docs/claims/CLAIMS_DOMAIN_MAP.csv`
- Claims in range: 50
- Open claims in range: 0

## Open claims (in-range, oldest-first by last_verified)

- (none)

## Details (all claims in range)
