url = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgor.2003.12.002"
relevance = "Formal hashing analysis frames collision behavior in algorithmic complexity terms, not a derivation of physical inverse-square force laws."

[inference]
summary = "The proposed latency-to-gravity relationship is currently an analogy, not an externally validated physical derivation."
recommended_action = "Use STPT-009 strictly as computational falsification experiment; avoid promoting physical equivalence claims without new evidence."
