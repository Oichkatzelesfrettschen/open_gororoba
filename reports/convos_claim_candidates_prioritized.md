# Convos Claim Candidates (Prioritized Shortlist, 2026-02-01)

This is a manual shortlist derived from `reports/convos_claim_candidates.md`.
All items are hypotheses only (convos are not authoritative).

## Priority 1 (immediate, evidence-first)

These align with the current "emergence layers" program and already have partial in-repo toys.

1. Geometry from operator data requires spectral-triple strength, not eigenvalues alone.
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-PROG-001)
   - Evidence hooks: C-403 + `tests/test_isospectral_nonisomorphic_pair.py`

2. Bulk reconstructability can be organized by modular data and entanglement wedges (QEC framing).
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-PROG-002)
   - Evidence hooks: C-404 + `tests/test_holography_bit_threads.py`

3. Observers as correctable record algebras selected by open-system dynamics (GKSL/Lindblad).
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-PROG-003)
   - Evidence hooks: C-405 + `tests/test_open_systems_lindblad.py`

## Priority 2 (thesis-hardening lacunae)

These are methodological commitments that make the overall program falsifiable rather than poetic.

4. Box-kite uniqueness under automorphisms (avoid "picked the embedding that worked").
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-GAP-001)

5. Explicit look-elsewhere accounting (trial factors across tuned degrees of freedom).
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-GAP-002)

6. Symmetric falsification criteria (clear disconfirmation thresholds).
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-GAP-003)

7. Uncertainty visualization (credible regions, Monte Carlo envelopes).
   - Seed: `docs/convos/CONVOS_CLAIMS_INBOX.md` (INBOX-GAP-004)

## Priority 3 (defer: many "theorem" strings are non-theorems)

The auto-scan reports hundreds of "theorem" hits in transcripts; most are narrative labels.
Treat these as prompts to define precise statements, not as established results.

- Example hotspot: `convos/1_read_each_nonuser_line.md` contains multiple "Theorem" headings
  (e.g., "Fractal Homotopy Invariance") that require complete definitions, a model, and proof.
