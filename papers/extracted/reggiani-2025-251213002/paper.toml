Abstract\r
We study zero divisors in the 16-dimensional sedenion algebra from an explicit deter\u0002minantal and geometric viewpoint. For the left multiplication operator Lv we prove\r
that\r
det Lv = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
where D1 and D2 are quartic polynomials in the octonion components v1, v2 of v, and\r
nonzero zero divisors are characterized by D2 (v) = 0. Here D1 coincides with the\r
squared norm of v, while D2 recovers the classical geometric condition ||v1 || = ||v2 ||,\r
<v1, v2> = 0 known in work of Moreno and others, but now as an explicit determinant\r
factor.\r
On a carefully chosen 3-dimensional linear slice we derive a local model D2 (X, Y, Z) =\r
4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
, so that the zero-divisor set is described there by the quadratic\r
cone XY +Y Z +Z X = 0, and we confirm this by 2D/3D numerical visualization. After\r
normalization, the nontrivial zero divisors form the Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
); on this\r
space we introduce a simple discrete approximation to the Levi-Civita connection and\r
compute its holonomy along a great circle. Projected to a torus of base/fiber angles, the\r
resulting holonomy appears as a concrete (1, 1)-type twisting curve. This illustrates\r
how explicit polynomials and computer graphics can reveal geometric structure in a\r
highly nonassociative algebra.\r
1 Introduction\r
Via the Cayley-Dickson construction, starting from the field of real numbers R, one obtains the complex\r
numbers, quaternions, octonions, and then the 16-dimensional nondivision algebra known as the sedenions.\r
The sedenions lose both associativity and divisibility, but are interesting in that they possess many zero\r
divisors. However, the geometric structure of the zero-divisor set is high-dimensional, and it is difficult to\r
grasp its behavior intuitively.\r
Existing works have shown that the zero-divisor sets of the octonions and the sedenions are related to\r
Stiefel manifolds and the exceptional Lie group G2, but the framework there is primarily topological or\r
Riemannian-geometric, and there has been comparatively little understanding via explicit polynomials and\r
visualization (see, for example, Moreno [3]). The zero-divisor condition\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0\r
used in this paper is itself already known in the literature on zero divisors in Cayley-Dickson algebras,\r
such as Moreno [3]. The novelty of the present study lies in recasting this condition as a concrete quartic\r

polynomial D2 arising as a factor of the determinant\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
of the 16x16 real matrix corresponding to left multiplication, and presenting it in a form that can be directly\r
utilized for local models, numerical visualization, and holonomy analysis.\r
In this paper, we focus on the left multiplication matrix of the sedenions and factorize its determinant\r
Delta(v) = det M(v) explicitly in order to extract two essential factors D1, D2 for zero-divisor detection. In\r
particular, D2 is the factor that characterizes nonzero zero divisors, and its zero set reflects the geometric\r
structure of the zero-divisor set. Beyond making the classical condition |v1| = |v2|, <v1, v2> = 0 appear\r
as a determinant factor, we analyze D2 on a specific 3-dimensional linear slice and show that the local\r
singular structure is given by the quadratic cone XY +Y Z + Z X = 0, and we define a discrete version of the\r
Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold to visualize its holonomy as curves on a\r
torus.\r
Related work\r
The algebraic and geometric pathology of the sedenions has been discussed from several perspectives.\r
Conway-Smith [2] and Baez [1] emphasized the loss of alternativity and the proliferation of zero divisors\r
once one leaves the octonions, and Moreno [3] gave an explicit description of zero divisors in terms of pairs\r
of orthogonal octonions of equal norm.\r
Eakin-Sathaye [4], Albuquerque-Majid [7], and Okubo [5, 6] study the algebraic properties of Cayley-\r
Dickson algebras that underpin our block matrix decompositions. Standard treatments of Cayley-Dickson\r
algebras and their homogeneous spaces appear in Schafer [9]. In particular, the conditions ||v1 || = ||v2 || and\r
<v1, v2> = 0 for the octonionic components (v1, v2) are classical.\r
To our knowledge, however, these conditions have not been systematically reinterpreted in terms of the\r
determinant of the left multiplication operator, nor has the quartic factor D2 been written out explicitly in\r
G2-invariant coordinates. Likewise, while the singular nature of the zero-divisor variety is well known, we\r
are not aware of previous work that isolates a concrete three-dimensional slice with a simple double-cone\r
model or that connects the zero-divisor geometry to numerical experiments on Levi-Civita holonomy over\r
the associated Stiefel manifold.\r
Main contributions\r
The geometric and algebraic structure of zero divisors in the sedenions has been investigated from various\r
viewpoints, but several aspects remain only implicitly understood. In this note we isolate and clarify three\r
features that we regard as conceptually useful.\r
(C1) We reinterpret the classical zero-divisor conditions ||v1 || = ||v2 || and <v1, v2> = 0 (which go back\r
at least to Moreno and are implicit in the work of Conway-Smith and Baez) as the vanishing of a\r
distinguished quartic factor D2 in the determinant of the left multiplication operator Lv. In particular,\r
we give an explicit factorization\r
det Lv = D1 (v)\r
4 D2 (v)2\r
in terms of the standard G2-invariant scalar triple (a, b, c) on the imaginary octonion components\r
and identify D2 = 0 as the decisive algebraic condition for the zero-divisor locus.\r
(C2) We restrict D2 to a simple 3-dimensional linear slice of the zero-divisor variety and obtain the\r
concrete equation\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4 (XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
.\r
This shows that, at least along this slice, the zero-divisor set is modeled by the double cone XY +\r
Y Z + Z X = 0. We propose this as a canonical local prototype for singularities of the zero-divisor\r
variety and illustrate its geometry via explicit computer graphics.\r
(C3) On the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal zero-divisor pairs (which we informally regard as the zero-\r
divisor frame bundle), we numerically study the Levi-Civita parallel transport along natural torus-type\r
loops. Using a simple Euler-type integrator, we observe that the resulting holonomy generically has\r
(1, 1)-type: it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the span of the two zero divisors and is close to the\r
2

identity on the orthogonal complement. This provides an initial link between the singular algebraic\r
geometry of zero divisors and the Riemannian holonomy of the associated frame space.\r
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec 2 we present the minimal preliminaries on the Cayley-\r
Dickson construction and the definition of the left multiplication operator. In Sec 3 we derive the factorization\r
of the determinant of the left multiplication matrix and present Delta = D\r
4\r
1D\r
2\r
2\r
as a main theorem. In Sec 4\r
we discuss the identification of the normalized zero-divisor manifold with the Stiefel manifold. In Sec 5 we\r
analyze and visualize the local model of D2 on a cyclic permutation slice. In Sec 6 we describe the visualization\r
of the holonomy. Finally, in Sec 7 and Sec 8 we give discussion and conclusions.\r
2 Preliminaries\r
2.1 Cayley-Dickson construction and the sedenions\r
The Cayley-Dickson construction gives a procedure to obtain the complex numbers, quaternions, octonions,\r
and higher nonassociative algebras by successively doubling the dimension starting from the real numbers\r
R. In this paper, we take the octonion algebra O as known and construct the sedenion algebra S from it.\r
As a vector space, S is isomorphic to O + O, and any element v in S can be uniquely written as\r
v = v1 + v2e8, v1, v2 in O.\r
Here e8 is a new imaginary basis element that anticommutes with elements of O. Thus, as a vector space,\r
S \u001B O + O \u001B R\r
8 x R8 \u001B R16\r
.\r
The multiplication rule follows the general Cayley-Dickson formula; in this paper we use only the minimal\r
information needed to construct the left multiplication matrix.\r
2.2 Left multiplication operators and the determinant\r
For v in S we define the left multiplication operator Lv : S -> S by\r
Lv (w) = vw (w in S).\r
Once a basis {e0, . . . , e15} is fixed, Lv is represented by a 16 x 16 real matrix M(v) on R\r
16\r
.\r
Definition 2.1 (Determinant of the left multiplication matrix). We define\r
Delta(v) := det M(v).\r
The condition Delta(v) = 0 means that Lv is degenerate, and hence there exists w != 0 such that vw = 0.\r
Therefore, Delta(v) = 0 is equivalent to v being a zero divisor. A concrete factorization of this Delta is one of the\r
main results of the present work.\r
3 Determinant Factorization\r
In this section, we show that the determinant of the left multiplication matrix,\r
Delta(v) := det M(v),\r
can be factorized as\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
in terms of two fundamental invariants D1, D2. Here D1, D2 are homogeneous polynomials determined by\r
the norms and inner products of v = v1 + v2e8, and we also explain their geometric meaning.\r
3

3.1 Definition of the fundamental factors D1 and D2\r
Definition 3.1 (Fundamental factors D1, D2). For a sedenion v = v1 + v2e8 (v1, v2 in O), define\r
D1 (v) := ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
,\r
D2 (v) :=\r
\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
\u00012\r
+ 4 <v1, v2>\r
2\r
,\r
where || * || is the Euclidean norm on R\r
8 and <*, *> denotes the standard inner product.\r
First, D1 agrees with the squared norm of v itself.\r
Lemma 3.2. For v = v1 + v2e8 we have\r
||v||\r
2 = D1 (v) = ||v1 ||2 + ||v2 ||2\r
.\r
Proof. In the Cayley-Dickson construction, the inner product is defined by\r
<v1 + v2e8, w1 + w2e8> = <v1, w1> + <v2, w2>.\r
In particular, setting w = v gives\r
||v||\r
2 = <v, v> = <v1, v1> + <v2, v2> = ||v1 ||2 + ||v2 ||2\r
.\r
box\r
On the other hand, D2 is the polynomial that vanishes exactly when the two norms are equal and the\r
vectors are orthogonal.\r
Lemma 3.3. For v = v1 + v2e8 != 0, we have\r
D2 (v) = 0 <==> ||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0.\r
Proof. From the definition,\r
D2 (v) =\r
\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||\r
2\r
\u00012\r
+ 4 <v1, v2>\r
2\r
.\r
The right-hand side is a sum of two nonnegative real numbers, so D2 (v) = 0 if and only if\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2 = 0, <v1, v2> = 0\r
hold simultaneously. The first condition is equivalent to ||v1 || = ||v2 ||, and the second is the orthogonality\r
condition. Conversely, if these two conditions hold, then clearly D2 (v) = 0. box\r
Thus, D1 is the norm of v, while D2 captures the geometric condition that the lengths of v1 and v2 are\r
equal and they are orthogonal.\r
3.2 Block representation of the left multiplication matrix\r
For v in S, the left multiplication operator Lv : S -> S is defined by\r
Lv (w) = vw (w in S).\r
If we fix a basis of the 16-dimensional real vector space S \u001B R\r
16, then Lv is represented by a 16 x 16 real\r
matrix M(v).\r
Lemma 3.4 (Block matrix representation). For v = v1 + v2e8 in S, with a suitable choice of basis, the left\r
multiplication matrix M(v) can be written as\r
M(v) =\r
\u0012\r
Lv1 -Rv2\r
Lv2 Rv1\r
\u0013\r
,\r
where Lv1\r
, Lv2\r
, Rv1\r
, Rv2\r
are the left and right multiplication matrices on the octonions O.\r
4

Proof. Using the Cayley-Dickson multiplication formula\r
(v1 + v2e8) (w1 + w2e8) = (v1w1 - w2v2) + (v2w1 + w2v1)e8,\r
where * denotes octonion conjugation, we obtain\r
w1 ->--> v1w1 - w2v2, w2 ->--> v2w1 + w2v1\r
for w = w1 + w2e8. Writing these as linear maps on O, we have\r
(w1, w2) ->--> Lv1w1 - Rv2w2, Lv2w1 + Rv1w2\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Taking matrix representations with respect to a fixed basis yields the claimed block matrix. box\r
Since the octonions form a normed division algebra, the determinants of the left and right multiplication\r
matrices are determined solely by the norm.\r
Lemma 3.5 (Determinants of left and right multiplication on the octonions). For any x in O we have\r
det Lx = ||x||\r
8\r
, det Rx = ||x||\r
8\r
.\r
Proof. The octonions form a normed division algebra, and hence for any x, y in O,\r
||xy|| = ||x|| ||y||\r
holds. The operator Lx corresponds to the linear map y ->-> xy, and so for all y we have\r
||Lx (y) || = ||xy|| = ||x|| ||y||.\r
Thus Lx is an isometry that scales the norm by ||x||, and hence the absolute value of its determinant is ||x||\r
8\r
.\r
Since det L1 = 1 for x = 1 and the determinant depends continuously on x, we have det Lx > 0 for all x.\r
The same argument applies to Rx. box\r
3.3 Main theorem on determinant factorization\r
With these preparations in hand, we now state the main result of this section.\r
Theorem 3.6 (Determinant factorization for sedenion left multiplication). For any v in S, the determinant\r
Delta(v) := det M(v)\r
of the left multiplication matrix can be factorized as\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4 D2 (v)2\r
.\r
In particular, v != 0 is a zero divisor if and only if D2 (v) = 0.\r
Proof. Write v = v1 + v2e8 and set\r
a := ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
, b := ||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
, c := <v1, v2>.\r
These correspond to D1, D2 in Definition 3.1 via\r
D1 (v) = a, D2 (v) = b\r
2 + 4c2\r
.\r
(1) Reduction to invariants. The automorphism group G2 of the octonions preserves the norm and inner\r
product and also preserves the Cayley-Dickson multiplication and left multiplication matrices (see, for\r
example, Baez [1], Bryant [8], and Moreno [3]). Extending the action to S \u001B O + O by\r
g(v1 + v2e8) := gv1 + gv2e8\r
5

for g in G2, we obtain an orthogonal transformation on S. Moreover, using the fact that g is an automorphism\r
of O and commutes with conjugation, we have\r
g\r
\r
(v1 + v2e8) (w1 + w2e8)\r
\u0001\r
= g(v1w1 - w2v2) + g(v2w1 + w2v1)e8\r
= (gv1) (gw1) - gw2 (gv2) + (gv2) gw1 + (gw2) (gv1)\r
\u0001\r
e8\r
= (gv1 + gv2e8) (gw1 + gw2e8).\r
Thus g is an algebra automorphism on S, and there exists an orthogonal matrix Tg such that\r
M(gv) = TgM(v)T\r
-1\r
g\r
,\r
and hence\r
Delta(gv) = det(TgM(v)T\r
-1\r
g\r
) = Delta(v).\r
This shows that Delta is a G2-invariant polynomial in (v1, v2).\r
On the other hand, ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
, ||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
, and <v1, v2> are natural quadratic invariants of the\r
diagonal G2-action (cf. Moreno [3]). Hence Delta(v1, v2) can be expressed as a polynomial in these quantities,\r
so there exists a polynomial G such that\r
Delta(v) = G(a, b, c).\r
Next we consider homogeneity. Since Lsv = sLv for s in R, we have\r
Delta(sv) = det(sM(v)) = s\r
16Delta(v).\r
On the other hand, a, b, c are all scaled by a factor of s\r
2\r
, so\r
G(s\r
2\r
a, s2b, s2c) = s\r
16G(a, b, c)\r
is required. Thus G is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8.\r
(2) Constraints from symmetry. Consider the operation of swapping v1 and v2:\r
(v1, v2) ->--> (v2, v1).\r
This is an orthogonal transformation on S \u001B O + O, and the corresponding left multiplication matrices are\r
similar, hence\r
Delta(v1, v2) = Delta(v2, v1).\r
Under this operation, a and c are invariant, while b changes sign:\r
(a, b, c) ->--> (a, -b, c).\r
Thus G(a, b, c) = G(a, -b, c), i.e., G is an even function of b.\r
Similarly, consider (v1, v2) ->-> (v1, -v2). This is again an orthogonal transformation on S, and since the\r
corresponding left multiplication matrices are related by similarity, we have\r
Delta(v1, -v2) = Delta(v1, v2).\r
Under this operation, a and b are invariant and c ->-> -c, so G(a, b, c) = G(a, b, -c), i.e., G is an even\r
function of c.\r
It follows that G is even in b and c, so it can be written as a polynomial in b\r
2\r
and c\r
2\r
. Equivalently, there\r
exists a polynomial H such that\r
G(a, b, c) = H\r
\r
a, b2, c2\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Since G is homogeneous of degree 8, H must be homogeneous of degree 4 in the variables a, b2, c2.\r
The space of such polynomials is a finite-dimensional vector space, and a basis is given by\r
a\r
4\r
, a2b\r
2\r
, a2c\r
2\r
, b4, b2c\r
2\r
, c4.\r
Indeed, since G is even in b and c, it can be written as a polynomial in b\r
2\r
, c2, and since a, b2, c2are\r
each homogeneous of degree 2 while G is homogeneous of degree 8, G is restricted to be a homogeneous\r
6

polynomial of degree 4 in a, b2\r
, c2. Therefore, G can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the\r
above six monomials, and there exist real coefficients , , , , ,  such that\r
G(a, b, c) = a4 + a2b\r
2 + a2\r
c\r
2 + b4 + b2\r
c\r
2 + c4\r
. (1)\r
(3) Determination of the coefficients. We have reduced G to a polynomial with six unknown coefficients\r
, , , , , . These coefficients can be determined uniquely by evaluating Delta(v) = G(a, b, c) on six\r
carefully chosen triples (a, b, c).\r
To make the linear system explicit, we substitute G(a, b, c) at\r
(a, b, c) in {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1)}.\r
For each triple, we pick a concrete v = v1 + v2e8 with the prescribed values of a = ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
,\r
b = ||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
, and c = <v1, v2>, compute the 16 x 16 matrix M(v) from Lemma 3.4, and evaluate\r
Delta(v) = det M(v). Substituting these six values into (1) produces a 6 x 6 linear system in the unknowns\r
, , , , , ; the corresponding monomial matrix is of Vandermonde type in (a, b2, c2) and is invertible.\r
A straightforward calculation (implemented by the computer algebra script sketched in Appendix A) gives\r
the unique solution\r
G(a, b, c) = a\r
4\r
(b\r
2 + 4c2\r
)\r
2\r
.\r
Hence\r
Delta(v) = G(a, b, c) =\r
\r
||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
\u00014\r
(||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
)\r
2 + 4<v1, v2>2\r
\u00012\r
= D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
for all v in S.\r
(4) Equivalence with the zero-divisor condition. The condition v != 0 being a zero divisor is equivalent\r
to Delta(v) = 0, since this is equivalent to the left multiplication operator Lv having nontrivial kernel. By\r
Lemma 3.2, we have D1 (v) = ||v||\r
2 > 0 whenever v != 0, and therefore\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2 = 0 <==> D2 (v) = 0.\r
Thus, v != 0 is a zero divisor if and only if D2 (v) = 0. box\r
Corollary 3.7 (Characterization of nonzero zero divisors). A nonzero element v != 0 is a zero divisor if and\r
only if\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0\r
hold.\r
Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.3. box\r
3.4 Component expressions for D1 and D2\r
Write a sedenion v in S in components as\r
v =\r
sum\r
15\r
m=0\r
amem, am in R.\r
Then D1, D2 can also be expressed as polynomials in these components.\r
Theorem 3.8 (Component expressions for the factors).\r
D1 (v) =\r
sum\r
15\r
m=0\r
a\r
2\r
m,\r
D2 (v) =\r
sum\r
15\r
m,n=0\r

where\r
sgn(m, n) =\r
{||||||\r
|||||\r
}\r
-1 if m in {0, . . . , 7}, n in {8, . . . , 15}, |m - n| != 8,\r
-1 if m in {8, . . . , 15}, n in {0, . . . , 7}, |m - n| != 8,\r
+1 otherwise.\r

Proof. For D1, Lemma 3.2 gives\r
D1 (v) = ||v||\r
2\r
,\r
which is clearly the sum of the squares of the components I15\r
m=0\r
a\r
2\r
m.\r
For D2, write v1 = (a0, . . . , a7) and v2 = (a8, . . . , a15). Substituting into Definition 3.1, we have\r
||v1 ||\r
2 =\r
sum\r
7\r
i=0\r
a\r
2\r
i\r
, ||v2 ||\r
2 =\r
sum\r

i=0\r
a\r
2\r
i+8\r
, <v1, v2> =\r
sum\r
7\r
i=0\r
aiai+8.\r
Substituting these into\r
D2 =\r
\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
\u00012\r
+ 4\r
\r
<v1, v2>\r
\u00012\r
and expanding, then collecting like terms, yields the stated form. The calculation involves many terms but\r
each is a simple degree-4 monomial, and the identity can be checked either by hand or with a computer\r
algebra system without difficulty. box\r
4 The Normalized Zero-Divisor Manifold and the Stiefel Manifold\r
As shown in the previous section, nonzero left zero divisors are characterized by D2 (v) = 0, which\r
geometrically corresponds to the conditions\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0\r
for v = v1 + v2e8. In this section, we normalize the norm to identify the resulting manifold with a Stiefel\r
manifold.\r
Definition 4.1 (Normalized zero-divisor manifold). Define\r
E :=\r
n\r
(v1, v2) in R\r
8 x R8\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f ||v1 || = 1, ||v2 || = 1, <v1, v2> = 0\r
o\r
.\r
This is the set of all orthonormal 2-frames in R\r
8\r
.\r
Definition 4.2 (Stiefel manifold). In general, the Stiefel manifoldVk (R\r
n\r
) is defined as the set of orthonormal\r
k-frames in R\r
n\r
:\r
Vk (R\r
n\r
) :=\r
\b\r
(e1, . . . , ek) in (R\r
n\r
)\r
k\r
\f\r
\f <ei\r
, e j> = i j \t\r
.\r
Proposition 4.3. E is naturally diffeomorphic to V2 (R\r
8\r
).\r
Proof. The map\r
Phi: E -> V2 (R\r
8\r
), Phi(v1, v2) = (v1, v2)\r
is clearly well-defined and bijective by definition. Since both E andV2 (R\r
8\r
) are smooth submanifolds of R\r
8x\r
R\r
8 with the induced smooth structure, and Phi is the restriction of the identity map, it is a diffeomorphism. box\r
Thus, as a smooth manifold, the normalized zero-divisor set is\r
E \u001B V2 (R\r
8\r
).\r
The Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
) admits a fibration\r
S\r
7\r
<--> V2 (R\r
8\r
) -> S\r
7\r
,\r
and has rich topological structure. However, since the focus of this work is numerical experiments and\r
visualization, we do not go into the detailed topology here.\r
Theorem 4.4 (Structure of the set of zero divisors). Let S be the sedenion algebra obtained from the\r
Cayley-Dickson construction and write elements as v = (v1, v2) with v1, v2 in O. Let Z subset S \\ {0} be the set\r
of nontrivial left zero divisors (which we simply call zero divisors in this section).\r
Then Z admits a natural smooth manifold structure of dimension 14, and there is a natural diffeomorphism\r
Z \u001B (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
),\r
where V2 (R\r
8\r
) denotes the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal 2-frames in R\r
8\r
.\r
8

Proof. We use the notation v = (v1, v2) in S = O + O. Recall from Corollary 3.7 that a nonzero element\r
v in S is a left zero divisor if and only if\r
||v1 || = ||v2 || and <v1, v2> = 0. (2)\r
In particular, for a zero divisor we have ||v1 ||\r
2 = ||v2 ||2 > 0, so both v1 and v2 are nonzero.\r
Let Z subset S \\ {0} be the set of nontrivial left zero divisors. We first construct an explicit bijection\r
Phi : (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) --> Z.\r
Step 1: Definition of the map. For (r, (u1, u2)) in (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
), define\r
Phi(r, (u1, u2)) := (ru1, ru2) in S.\r
Here we identify O with R\r
8\r
in the usual way. Since (u1, u2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
), we have ||u1 || = ||u2 || = 1 and\r
<u1, u2> = 0. Therefore\r
||ru1 || = r, ||ru2 || = r, <ru1, ru2> = r\r
2\r
<u1, u2> = 0.\r
By the characterization (2), Phi(r, (u1, u2)) is a (nontrivial) left zero divisor. Thus Phi indeed maps into Z.\r
Step 2: Surjectivity. Let v = (v1, v2) in Z be an arbitrary nontrivial left zero divisor. Then by (2) we have\r
||v1 || = ||v2 || =: r > 0, <v1, v2> = 0.\r
Define\r
u1 :=\r
v1\r
r\r
, u2 :=\r
v2\r
r\r
.\r
Then ||u1 || = ||u2 || = 1 and <u1, u2> =\r
1\r
r\r
2\r
<v1, v2> = 0, so (u1, u2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
). Clearly\r
v = (v1, v2) = (ru1, ru2) = Phir, (u1, u2)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Thus Phi is surjective.\r
Step 3: Injectivity. Suppose\r
Phi\r
\r
r, (u1, u2)\r
\u0001\r
= Phis, (w1, w2)\r
\u0001\r
,\r
i.e. (ru1, ru2) = (sw1, sw2) for some r, s in (0, infinity) and (u1, u2), (w1, w2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
). Then\r
ru1 = sw1, ru2 = sw2.\r
Taking norms and using ||u1 || = ||w1 || = 1, we obtain\r
r = ||ru1 || = ||sw1 || = s.\r
Hence r = s, and it follows that u1 = w1 and u2 = w2. Thus (u1, u2) = (w1, w2) and Phi is injective.\r
Step 4: Smoothness and manifold structure. The map\r
Phi : (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) -> S \\ {0}\r
is clearly smooth, being polynomial in the coordinates. Its inverse\r
Psi : Z --> (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
), Psi(v1, v2) :=\r
\u0010\r
||v1 ||,\r
\r
v1\r
||v1 ||\r
,\r
v2\r
||v2 ||\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
is well-defined on Z, because (2) implies ||v1 || = ||v2 || > 0 and hence both v1 and v2 are nonzero. It is\r
also smooth, as it is given by smooth algebraic operations (in particular, division by a positive scalar). Thus\r
Phi is a diffeomorphism between (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) and Z, which endows Z with a natural smooth manifold\r
structure.\r
Since dimV2 (R\r
8\r
) = 2 * 8 -\r
2*3\r
2\r
= 13, we obtain\r
dim Z = 1 + dimV2 (R\r
8\r
) = 14.\r
Because S \\ {0} has dimension 16, the set Z has codimension 2 in S \\ {0}. box\r

5 Cyclic Permutation Slice and Local Model\r
In this section, we analyze D2 on a specific 3-dimensional linear slice and show that its zero set is given by\r
the quadratic cone XY + Y Z + Z X = 0. This can be interpreted as a local model for the singular structure\r
of the zero-divisor set.\r
5.1 Definition of the cyclic permutation slice\r
Definition 5.1 (Cyclic permutation slice). For parameters X, Y, Z in R, consider two 8-dimensional vectors\r
v1 (X, Y, Z) = (X, Y, Z, c, 0, 0, 0, 0),\r
v2 (X, Y, Z) = (Y, Z, X, 0, c, 0, 0, 0),\r
where c > 0 is a fixed constant (we use c =\r
1\r
2\r
in numerical experiments). Then\r
L := {(v1 (X, Y, Z), v2 (X, Y, Z)) | X, Y, Z in R}\r
is a 3-dimensional linear subspace of R\r
8 x R8 ~= R16. The restriction of D2 to L is called the local model\r
on the cyclic permutation slice in this paper.\r
Remark 5.2 (Motivation for choosing the cyclic permutation slice). The cyclic permutation slice used in\r
this work is chosen for two main reasons. First, by preserving the cyclic symmetry in the indices of (X, Y, Z),\r
we can expect D2 to be expressed in terms of a symmetric quadratic form such as XY + Y Z + Z X. Second,\r
for a general zero divisor (v1, v2), it is expected that, via the action of G2 and scalar rescaling, one can\r
reduce to a normal form lying in some 3-dimensional subspace; the present slice serves as a prototype\r
of such a reduction. In this paper we do not rigorously discuss to what extent this slice represents the\r
singular structure of the entire zero-divisor set, but numerical experiments show that the quadratic cone\r
XY + Y Z + Z X = 0 indeed appears as a typical local model.\r
5.2 Norms and inner products\r
Lemma 5.3. For the above v1, v2 we have\r
||v1 ||\r
2 = X2 + Y2 + Z2 + c2\r
, ||v2 ||\r
2 = X2 + Y2 + Z2 + c2\r
,\r
<v1, v2> = XY + Y Z + Z X.\r
Proof. The component vector of v1 is (X, Y, Z, c, 0, 0, 0, 0), so\r
||v1 ||\r
2 = X2 + Y2 + Z2 + c2\r
.\r
Similarly, v2 = (Y, Z, X, 0, c, 0, 0, 0), hence\r
||v2 ||\r
2 = Y2 + Z2 + X2 + c2 = X2 + Y2 + Z2 + c2\r
.\r
For the inner product we have\r
<v1, v2> = X * Y + Y * Z + Z * X + c * 0 + 0 * c + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0,\r
and thus\r
<v1, v2> = XY + Y Z + Z X.\r
box\r
10

5.3 The local model theorem\r
Theorem 5.4 (Local model on the cyclic permutation slice). On the cyclic permutation slice L, the factor\r
D2 is given by\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4 (XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
.\r
Hence the zero-divisor condition D2 = 0 agrees with the quadratic cone\r
XY + Y Z + Z X = 0.\r
Proof. From Definition 3.1 and Lemma 5.3, we have\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2 = 0, <v1, v2> = XY + Y Z + Z X.\r
Therefore\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) =\r
\u0010\r
||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
\u00112\r
+ 4 <v1, v2>\r
2\r
= 0\r
2 + 4 (XY + Y Z + Z X)2\r
= 4 (XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
.\r
Since 4 != 0, the condition D2 (X, Y, Z) = 0 is equivalent to\r
(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2 = 0,\r
and over the reals this is equivalent to\r
XY + Y Z + Z X = 0.\r
box\r
Remark 5.5 (Singular structure). The gradient of the quadratic form\r
Q(X, Y, Z) = XY + Y Z + Z X\r
is given by\r
nablaQ = (Y + Z, X + Z, X + Y).\r
The condition nablaQ = 0 yields\r
Y + Z = 0, X + Z = 0, X + Y = 0,\r
whose simultaneous solution is (X, Y, Z) = (0, 0, 0) only. Thus, the quadratic cone Q = 0 has an isolated\r
singularity at the origin, and the local structure of the zero-divisor set on the cyclic permutation slice can\r
be understood as the neighborhood of this singularity. It is an ordinary double point (type A1) in this\r
3-dimensional slice, capturing the simplest nontrivial singularity compatible with the symmetries of the\r
model.\r
5.4 2D slices and 3D isosurfaces\r
If we fix Z = 0, Theorem 5.4 gives\r
D2 (X, Y, 0) = 4 (XY + 0 + 0)\r
2 = 4 (XY)2\r
,\r
so the zero set is\r
XY = 0,\r
i.e., X = 0 or Y = 0. Thus, on the plane Z = 0, the zero set forms a cross through the origin.\r
In the numerical experiment, we compute D2 (Xi, Yj, 0) on a grid of points (Xi, Yj, 0) and visualize\r
log(1 + D2) as a color map, confirming that the values are small along X = 0 and Y = 0 (Figure 1, left).\r
Furthermore, plotting the contour of the region where D2 <  for a small threshold  > 0, we observe good\r
agreement with the theoretical curves X = 0 and Y = 0 (Figure 1, right).\r
11

D2 (X, Y, 0)). Right: contour D2 =  (red) compared with the theoretical lines X = 0 and Y = 0 (blue\r
dashed). The excellent agreement supports the local model D2 (X, Y, 0) = 4(XY)\r
2\r
. Grid: 81x81, threshold\r
 = 0.01.\r
We also compute D2 (X, Y, Z) on a three-dimensional grid and extract the isosurface\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = \r
for a fixed level  using the marching cubes method, thereby visualizing the -neighborhood of the quadratic\r
cone XY + Y Z + Z X = 0 in 3D. Specifically, we sample (X, Y, Z) uniformly in [-R, R]\r
3 with R = 1\r
and N = 81 grid points per direction, evaluate D2 at each node, and run a standard marching cubes\r
implementation to recover the level set. This isosurface has the shape of a saddle-like double cone,\r
providing an intuitive picture of the singular structure near the origin.\r
Figure 2: Isosurface of the local zero-divisor factor D2 (X, Y, Z) at level D2 = ; color encodes <v1, v2> on\r
the surface. The surface is a numerical approximation of the quadratic cone XY +Y Z + Z X = 0, visualising\r
the isolated singularity at the origin (grid: N = 81,  = 0.01).\r
Remark 5.6 (Numerical stability). Varying the grid size N = 40, 80, 120 and the threshold  = 10-3, 10-4,\r
we confirm that the cross-shaped slice corresponding to XY = 0 and the shape of the quadratic cone\r
12

remain qualitatively unchanged, indicating that the topological structure of the -neighborhood is stable\r
with respect to these choices.\r
6 Holonomy of the Zero-Divisor Frame Bundle\r
In the previous sections we have seen that, after normalization, the nonzero zero-divisor set\r
E =\r
\b\r
(v1, v2) in R\r
8 x R8\r
\f\r
\f ||v1 || = ||v2 || = 1, <v1, v2> = 0\r
\t\r
can be identified with the Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
). The Stiefel manifold is usually defined as\r
V2 (R\r
8\r
) :=\r
\b\r
(v1, v2) in R\r
8 x R8\r
\f\r
\f ||v1 || = ||v2 || = 1, <v1, v2> = 0\r
\t\r
,\r
so E coincides with this standard definition. The homogeneous description V2 (R\r
8\r
) = SO(8)/SO(6) and\r
related symmetric-space features are developed in Helgason [10]. In this section we consider the Levi-\r
Civita connection induced by the Euclidean metric on this zero-divisor frame bundle and visualize its\r
parallel transport as curves on a torus.\r
The update rule used here refines the earlier ad hoc numerical connection and is instead regarded\r
as a first-order Euler approximation to the Levi-Civita connection induced by the Euclidean metric on\r
E subset (R\r
8\r
)\r
2\r
. Thus it is not an ad hoc rule, but a natural parallel transport algorithm based on a standard\r
geometric structure.\r
6.1 Discrete approximation of the Levi-Civita connection\r
The submanifold E subset (R\r
8\r
)\r
2\r
inherits a natural Riemannian metric from the standard inner product on R\r
8\r
, and\r
the orthogonal projection formula exhibits the induced Levi-Civita connection as detailed in Petersen [11],\r
<(x1, x2), (y1, y2)>E := <x1, y1> + <x2, y2>.\r
The Levi-Civita connection of this metric is defined, for an embedded submanifold, by projecting the\r
ambient derivative in R\r
16 orthogonally onto the tangent space.\r
In numerical experiments, we fix a time step Deltat > 0 and consider a discrete curve\r
tk = kDeltat, (v1 (tk), v2 (tk)) in E,\r
parametrized by t in [0, 2]. In this paper, we prescribe v1 (t) as a known loop on S\r
7\r
, and update v2 (t) in\r
such a way that it changes as little as possible while preserving the orthonormality, which yields a discrete\r
approximation of the connection.\r
Definition 6.1 (Euler-type discrete approximation of the Levi-Civita connection). Suppose that at time t\r
we have a frame (v1 (t), v2 (t)) in E, and that the new first vector at time t + Deltat,\r
v1 (t + Deltat) in S\r
7\r
,\r
is given. We define the new second vector v2 (t + Deltat) in two steps:\r
1. First, project v2 (t) onto the subspace orthogonal to the new vector v1 (t + Deltat):\r
v~2 := v2 (t) - <v2 (t), v1 (t + Deltat)> v1 (t + Deltat). (3)\r
2. Then normalize v~2 to obtain\r
v2 (t + Deltat) :=\r
v~2\r
||v~2 ||\r
. (4)\r

This projection-plus-normalization rule coincides with the simple update rule previously used as a numer\u0002ical connection, and it can now be directly understood as a first-order approximation to the Levi-Civita\r
connection. For an embedded submanifold M subset R\r
N with induced metric, the Levi-Civita connection\r
satisfies\r

,\r
the orthogonal projection of the ambient derivative. The map sending (v1 (t), v2 (t)) to (v1 (t+Deltat), v2 (t+Deltat))\r
via the above two-step rule simply applies the ambient update and then orthogonally projects back to\r
Tv1 (t+Deltat) S\r
7 before renormalizing, so it acts as a discrete approximation of parallel transport on E.\r
Geometrically, this procedure can be interpreted as follows: when v1 rotates slightly, v2 is rotated as\r
little as possible so that it remains of unit length and orthogonal to the new v1.\r
Lemma 6.2 (Preservation of orthonormality). If (v1 (t), v2 (t)) in E is updated to (v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat))\r
according to Definition 6.1, then (v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)) in E holds; that is,\r
||v1 (t + Deltat) || = ||v2 (t + Deltat) || = 1, <v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)> = 0\r
are preserved.\r
Proof. We assume by construction that v1 (t + Deltat) has norm 1. From the definition of ~v2 we have\r
<v~2, v1 (t + Deltat)> = <v2 (t), v1 (t + Deltat)> - <v2 (t), v1 (t + Deltat)><v1 (t + Deltat), v1 (t + Deltat)>\r
= 0,\r
so ~v2 is orthogonal to v1 (t+Deltat). Since v2 (t+Deltat) is obtained by normalizing ~v2, we have both ||v2 (t+Deltat) || = 1\r
and <v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)> = 0. box\r
This update rule can be regarded as an Euler discretization of the induced connection on E when\r
embedded into R\r
16\r
.\r
Proposition 6.3 (First-order approximation of the Levi-Civita connection). In the limit Deltat -> 0, the update\r
rule in Definition 6.1 approximates the parallel transport induced by the Levi-Civita connection on E to\r
first order.\r
Sketch of proof. The Levi-Civita parallel transport on S\r
7 preserves length while staying in the tangent space\r
and is characterized by minimizing rotation. On E \u001B V2 (R\r
8\r
), the tangent space satisfies\r
v2 perp v1, < v2, v2> = 0,\r
and the Levi-Civita connection again chooses v2 so that the frame evolves with minimal rotation.\r
In Definition 6.1, v1 is updated along a curve on S\r
7\r
, and then v2 is projected orthogonally onto the new\r
tangent space Tv1 (t+Deltat) S\r
7\r
and renormalized. This is precisely the projection formula used in the definition\r
of the induced connection on an embedded submanifold. Ultimately, differentiating the discrete update rule\r
with respect to t and comparing with the defining equation for Levi-Civita parallel transport shows that the\r
error is of order O(Deltat\r
2\r
), hence the approximation is first-order accurate. For conciseness, we omit the full\r
technical details here. box\r

6.2 Projection to a torus and holonomy curves\r
We next extract two angles from the frame (v1 (t), v2 (t)) on E and project them onto a torus\r
S\r
1\r
base x S\r
1\r
fiber.\r
Definition 6.4 (Projection to a torus). Fix the e0-e1 plane in R\r
8 and define the base angle by\r
(t) := argv\r
0\r
1\r
(t) + i v1\r
1\r
(t)\r
\u0001\r
along the great circle in that plane. We then project v2 (t) onto the same e0-e1 plane; when this projection\r
is nonzero we take its argument to define the fiber angle\r
(t) := argv\r
0\r
2\r
(t) + i v1\r
2\r
(t)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Taking ,  modulo 2 we regard\r
((t), (t)) in S\r
1\r
base x S\r
1\r
fiber\r
as a point on the torus whenever  is defined. In the numerical experiments underlying Proposition 6.5,\r
the chosen initial frame has v2 (0) projecting nontrivially to the e0-e1 plane, and the projection remained\r
nonzero throughout the simulation, so the fiber angle was well-defined along the sampled loop.\r
In the numerical experiment, we choose v1 (t) to be the great circle in the e0-e1 plane,\r
v1 (t) = (cost, sin t, 0, . . . , 0), t in [0, 2].\r
We take Deltat sufficiently small, update v2 (tk) according to Definition 6.1, and compute ((tk), (tk)) at each\r
step.\r
Plotting the point sequence ((tk), (tk)) in the unit square [0, 2) x [0, 2) while identifying opposite\r
edges as a torus, we obtain a nearly diagonal closed curve shown in Figure 3. This suggests that when the\r
base loop winds once, the fiber angle also winds approximately once, indicating a (1, 1)-type holonomy.\r
Figure 3: Numerical holonomy of the zero-divisor frame bundle projected to the torus S\r
1\r
base x S\r
1\r
fiber. The\r
base angle  is on the horizontal axis and the fiber angle  on the vertical axis. The curve appears as an\r
essentially (1, 1)-type closed curve, winding once in each direction as the base loop closes. (Numerical\r
parameters: num steps = 400, seed=42.)\r
15

To evaluate the holonomy more quantitatively, we define an unwrapped fiber angle ~(t) by removing 2\r
jumps from (t), and plot it as a function of (t). Figure 4 shows this plot, with  on the horizontal axis\r
and ~ on the vertical axis. A least-squares linear fit yields\r
~() approx  + const.,\r
indicating a linear relation with slope close to 1.\r
Observation 6.5 (Numerical holonomy for the great circle). For the base loop v1 (t) = (cost,sin t, 0, . . . , 0)\r
and the discrete parallel transport scheme in Definition 6.1, the numerically observed holonomy transfor\u0002mation exhibits the following qualitative behaviour:\r
(i) it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the oriented two-plane spanned by the zero-divisor frame (v1, v2);\r
(ii) it is close to the identity on the orthogonal complement of this two-plane.\r
In other words, the holonomy is typically of (1, 1)-type with respect to the decompositionR\r
8 = span{v1, v2}+\r
span{v1, v2}\r
perp, and the unwrapped slope ~() approx  + const. provides numerical evidence for this behaviour.\r
Remark 6.6. We emphasize that Observation 6.5 is based solely on numerical experiments using a simple\r
Euler integrator for the Levi-Civita connection. At present we do not claim a rigorous theorem asserting\r
that the holonomy is exactly of (1, 1)-type for the true Levi-Civita connection on the sedenionic zero-divisor\r
frame manifold; we regard these computations as evidence for such behaviour and as motivation for future\r
analytic work.\r
Lemma 6.7 (Toy model for (1, 1)-type holonomy). Consider the flat product manifold M := (S\r
1 xS1\r
) xR\r
k\r
with the standard product metric, and let E -> M be the trivial rank-n bundle with the Levi-Civita\r
connection induced from the ambient Euclidean space R\r
n\r
. Fix an orthogonal decomposition R\r
n = U + Uperp\r
with dimU = 2, and suppose that along M the subbundle U is tangent to the S\r
1 x S1-directions while Uperp\r
is constant.\r
Then the holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection along any fundamental loop of S\r
1 x S1\r
is a rotation\r
in U and the identity on U\r
perp. In particular, the holonomy is of (1, 1)-type with respect to the decomposition\r
U + U\r
perp.\r
Proof sketch. Since the metric on M is flat and of product type, the Levi-Civita connection on T M is trivial\r
in the R\r
k-directions and reduces to the standard flat connection on each S1\r
factor. The bundle E is trivial\r
with the constant splitting E = U + U\r
perp, and by assumption the connection preserves both subbundles.\r
Along a fundamental loop in one S\r
1-direction, the parallel transport in Uperp is therefore the identity, while\r
in U it is given by a rotation of some angle (completely determined by the chosen frame along S\r
1\r
). Since\r
the two S\r
1-directions commute and the connection is flat, the holonomy along any (m, n)-cycle in S1 x S1\r
is again a pure rotation in U and the identity on U\r
perp. box\r
Remark 6.8. Lemma 6.7 should be viewed only as a simplified caricature of the situation on the genuine\r
zero-divisor frame manifold, where the metric is curved and the splitting into the zero-divisor plane and its\r
orthogonal complement is not globally parallel. However, our numerical experiments suggest that, at least\r
along the torus-type loops considered in this section, the qualitative (1, 1)-type behaviour of the holonomy\r
persists. We regard this as evidence that the zero-divisor frame manifold inherits a geometric structure\r
reminiscent of the toy model above.\r
In the numerical experiments underlying Observation 6.5, we choose a generic initial frame (v1 (0), v2 (0)) in\r
E with v2 (0) having a nonzero projection to the base e0-e1 plane. We vary the time discretization param\u0002eter Deltat = 2/num steps with num steps in {100, 200, 400, 800} and find that the least-squares slope k in\r
~() approx k + const. remains stably close to 1 (typically k = 1.00 +/- 10-3). This indicates that the observed\r
(1, 1)-type holonomy is not an artifact of a particular discretization or initial condition.\r
The curvature tensor of the induced Levi-Civita connection on the Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
) is homoge\u0002neous under the SO(8)-action. The observed (1, 1)-type holonomy can be regarded as a concrete example\r
of an area-proportional phase caused by this curvature, analogous to the Berry phase in physics (cf. do\r
Carmo [12]). In this paper we confine ourselves to this qualitative discussion; a more detailed computation\r
of the curvature and its representation-theoretic description are left as future work.\r
16

Figure 4: Unwrapped fiber angle ~ as a function of the base angle . Blue dots indicate numerical data and\r
the orange line is a linear fit. The slope is approximately 1, indicating that the holonomy is a (1, 1)-type\r

7 Discussion\r
In this paper we have constructed fundamental factors D1, D2 of the determinant of the sedenion left\r
multiplication matrix,\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
and shown that D2 is the quartic polynomial that vanishes exactly under the geometric conditions\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0.\r
This gives a characterization of nonzero zero divisors via D2 (v) = 0. The geometric condition itself is\r
consistent with previous works such as Moreno [3] on zero divisors in Cayley-Dickson algebras, but the\r
present work is distinctive in providing it as an explicit determinant factor D2 in a form that can be directly\r
used for local modeling and visualization.\r
On the cyclic permutation slice, D2 simplifies to\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
,\r
so that its zero set is the quadratic cone XY + Y Z + Z X = 0. This is a concrete example showing that the\r
local structure of the zero-divisor set can be described as the zero set of a quadratic form in an appropriate\r
coordinate system. The slice used here is chosen as a typical model of reduction by the action of G2 and\r
scalar rescaling. An important future problem is to clarify, via the structure of G2-orbits and normal forms,\r
to what extent this quadratic cone model appears universally for general zero divisors.\r
We have also introduced a discrete Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold\r
E \u001B V2 (R\r
8\r
) and visualized its holonomy as curves on a torus. The observation that the holonomy of the\r
base great circle loop forms a (1, 1)-type closed curve suggests that the zero-divisor frame bundle has a\r
geometric structure that twists once per loop. The discretization adopted here can be seen as a numerical\r
approximation of a natural SO(8)-invariant connection, but since the sedenion multiplication is closely\r
related to the action of the exceptional group G2, it is expected that comparing the holonomy with the\r
standard representation of SO(8) and its restriction to G2 will yield a more algebraic understanding. In\r
this paper we do not go into these details and focus instead on visualization and observation, but a more\r
systematic analysis of the curvature tensor and representation-theoretic structure is an important direction\r
for future work.\r
From a symmetry viewpoint, the observed (1, 1)-type holonomy is also natural. The Stiefel manifold\r
V2 (R\r
8\r
) can be regarded as the homogeneous space SO(8)/SO(6) equipped with the SO(8)-invariant\r
Riemannian metric, and the Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by this symmetry. Our base\r
17

loop v1 (t) = (cost,sin t, 0, . . . , 0) arises from the action of a one-parameter subgroup SO(2) subset SO(8)\r
rotating the e0-e1 plane. In such a highly symmetric situation, there is essentially a unique natural scale\r
for the holonomy along one full rotation, and the simplest nontrivial possibility is that the frame twists\r
once when the base vector rotates once. The numerically observed slope ~() approx  + const. can therefore\r
be interpreted as a manifestation of this SO(8)-invariance, analogous to how the holonomy on a sphere is\r
determined solely by the enclosed area of a loop.\r
A natural next step would be to substantiate the observed (1, 1)-type holonomy by a more systematic\r
numerical study. One can investigate the convergence of the slope in Observation 6.5 as the step size\r
Deltat -> 0, the dependence on the initial frame and the great circle choice, and the behavior under global\r
SO(8)-rotations of the entire configuration. Moreover, by deforming the base loop within the e0-e1 plane\r
(e.g. to ellipses) and comparing the resulting holonomy with the enclosed area, it should be possible to\r
test an area law analogous to the Berry phase on spheres. Similar phenomena have been studied in sub\u0002Riemannian visualizations such as Montgomery [13] and Bullo-Lewis [14]. We leave a detailed numerical\r
and theoretical analysis of these questions to future work.\r
8 Conclusion\r
In this paper, we have visualized and analyzed the geometric structure of the sedenion zero-divisor set along\r
the following three main lines:\r
- We constructed fundamental factors D1, D2 such that the determinant of the left multiplication matrix\r
satisfies\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
and showed that nonzero zero divisors are characterized by the condition D2 (v) = 0.\r
- We analyzed D2 on the cyclic permutation slice and derived the local model\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
,\r
confirming via 2D/3D visualization that the local singular structure is given by the quadratic cone\r
XY + Y Z + Z X = 0.\r
- We introduced a discrete Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold and visu\u0002alized its holonomy as curves on a torus, thereby observing geometric twisting in the zero-divisor\r
frame bundle.\r
These results constitute a basic attempt to understand the zero-divisor geometry of an abstract nondivi\u0002sion algebra via explicit polynomials and computer graphics. Future directions include extending the analysis\r
to more general slices and higher Cayley-Dickson algebras, comparing different natural G2-invariant con\u0002nections, and elucidating the relations between curvature and topology. In particular, investigating the\r
homotopy classification of zero-divisor frame bundles based on the action of G2 and analyzing the curva\u0002ture structure of natural connections appear to be key steps toward embedding the visualizations obtained\r
here into a more algebraic framework.\r

Substituting these into\r

In practice, we use Python/SymPy to compute both the determinants of M(v\r

as rational polynomials, verify that A is invertible, and find the unique solution. The accompanying script\r
constructs M(v) from Lemma 3.4, substitutes the six test pairs (v\r

), evaluates each det M(v\r

),\r
assembles the matrix A of monomials in (a\r

, b(k), c(k)), and solves the 6 x 6 linear system symbolically.\r
We use a similar approach to determine the coefficient matrix and verify that the linear system has a unique\r
solution even for other choices of representative elements. The coefficient matrix A is invertible, and the\r
unique solution is given by\r

Singular Structures and Geometric Holonomy in the\r
Zero-Divisor Set of the Sedenions\r

Abstract\r
We study zero divisors in the 16-dimensional sedenion algebra from an explicit deter\u0002minantal and geometric viewpoint. For the left multiplication operator Lv we prove\r
that\r
det Lv = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
where D1 and D2 are quartic polynomials in the octonion components v1, v2 of v, and\r
nonzero zero divisors are characterized by D2 (v) = 0. Here D1 coincides with the\r
squared norm of v, while D2 recovers the classical geometric condition ||v1 || = ||v2 ||,\r
<v1, v2> = 0 known in work of Moreno and others, but now as an explicit determinant\r
factor.\r
On a carefully chosen 3-dimensional linear slice we derive a local model D2 (X, Y, Z) =\r
4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
, so that the zero-divisor set is described there by the quadratic\r
cone XY +Y Z +Z X = 0, and we confirm this by 2D/3D numerical visualization. After\r
normalization, the nontrivial zero divisors form the Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
); on this\r
space we introduce a simple discrete approximation to the Levi-Civita connection and\r
compute its holonomy along a great circle. Projected to a torus of base/fiber angles, the\r
resulting holonomy appears as a concrete (1, 1)-type twisting curve. This illustrates\r
how explicit polynomials and computer graphics can reveal geometric structure in a\r
highly nonassociative algebra."""

Via the Cayley-Dickson construction, starting from the field of real numbers R, one obtains the complex\r
numbers, quaternions, octonions, and then the 16-dimensional nondivision algebra known as the sedenions.\r
The sedenions lose both associativity and divisibility, but are interesting in that they possess many zero\r
divisors. However, the geometric structure of the zero-divisor set is high-dimensional, and it is difficult to\r
grasp its behavior intuitively.\r
Existing works have shown that the zero-divisor sets of the octonions and the sedenions are related to\r
Stiefel manifolds and the exceptional Lie group G2, but the framework there is primarily topological or\r
Riemannian-geometric, and there has been comparatively little understanding via explicit polynomials and\r
visualization (see, for example, Moreno [3]). The zero-divisor condition\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0\r
used in this paper is itself already known in the literature on zero divisors in Cayley-Dickson algebras,\r
such as Moreno [3]. The novelty of the present study lies in recasting this condition as a concrete quartic\r

polynomial D2 arising as a factor of the determinant\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
of the 16x16 real matrix corresponding to left multiplication, and presenting it in a form that can be directly\r
utilized for local models, numerical visualization, and holonomy analysis.\r
In this paper, we focus on the left multiplication matrix of the sedenions and factorize its determinant\r
Delta(v) = det M(v) explicitly in order to extract two essential factors D1, D2 for zero-divisor detection. In\r
particular, D2 is the factor that characterizes nonzero zero divisors, and its zero set reflects the geometric\r
structure of the zero-divisor set. Beyond making the classical condition |v1| = |v2|, <v1, v2> = 0 appear\r
as a determinant factor, we analyze D2 on a specific 3-dimensional linear slice and show that the local\r
singular structure is given by the quadratic cone XY +Y Z + Z X = 0, and we define a discrete version of the\r
Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold to visualize its holonomy as curves on a\r
torus.\r
Related work\r
The algebraic and geometric pathology of the sedenions has been discussed from several perspectives.\r
Conway-Smith [2] and Baez [1] emphasized the loss of alternativity and the proliferation of zero divisors\r
once one leaves the octonions, and Moreno [3] gave an explicit description of zero divisors in terms of pairs\r
of orthogonal octonions of equal norm.\r
Eakin-Sathaye [4], Albuquerque-Majid [7], and Okubo [5, 6] study the algebraic properties of Cayley-\r
Dickson algebras that underpin our block matrix decompositions. Standard treatments of Cayley-Dickson\r
algebras and their homogeneous spaces appear in Schafer [9]. In particular, the conditions ||v1 || = ||v2 || and\r
<v1, v2> = 0 for the octonionic components (v1, v2) are classical.\r
To our knowledge, however, these conditions have not been systematically reinterpreted in terms of the\r
determinant of the left multiplication operator, nor has the quartic factor D2 been written out explicitly in\r
G2-invariant coordinates. Likewise, while the singular nature of the zero-divisor variety is well known, we\r
are not aware of previous work that isolates a concrete three-dimensional slice with a simple double-cone\r
model or that connects the zero-divisor geometry to numerical experiments on Levi-Civita holonomy over\r
the associated Stiefel manifold.\r
Main contributions\r
The geometric and algebraic structure of zero divisors in the sedenions has been investigated from various\r
viewpoints, but several aspects remain only implicitly understood. In this note we isolate and clarify three\r
features that we regard as conceptually useful.\r
(C1) We reinterpret the classical zero-divisor conditions ||v1 || = ||v2 || and <v1, v2> = 0 (which go back\r
at least to Moreno and are implicit in the work of Conway-Smith and Baez) as the vanishing of a\r
distinguished quartic factor D2 in the determinant of the left multiplication operator Lv. In particular,\r
we give an explicit factorization\r
det Lv = D1 (v)\r
4 D2 (v)2\r
in terms of the standard G2-invariant scalar triple (a, b, c) on the imaginary octonion components\r
and identify D2 = 0 as the decisive algebraic condition for the zero-divisor locus.\r
(C2) We restrict D2 to a simple 3-dimensional linear slice of the zero-divisor variety and obtain the\r
concrete equation\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4 (XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
.\r
This shows that, at least along this slice, the zero-divisor set is modeled by the double cone XY +\r
Y Z + Z X = 0. We propose this as a canonical local prototype for singularities of the zero-divisor\r
variety and illustrate its geometry via explicit computer graphics.\r
(C3) On the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal zero-divisor pairs (which we informally regard as the zero-\r
divisor frame bundle), we numerically study the Levi-Civita parallel transport along natural torus-type\r
loops. Using a simple Euler-type integrator, we observe that the resulting holonomy generically has\r
(1, 1)-type: it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the span of the two zero divisors and is close to the\r
2

identity on the orthogonal complement. This provides an initial link between the singular algebraic\r
geometry of zero divisors and the Riemannian holonomy of the associated frame space.\r
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec 2 we present the minimal preliminaries on the Cayley-\r
Dickson construction and the definition of the left multiplication operator. In Sec 3 we derive the factorization\r
of the determinant of the left multiplication matrix and present Delta = D\r
4\r
1D\r
2\r
2\r
as a main theorem. In Sec 4\r
we discuss the identification of the normalized zero-divisor manifold with the Stiefel manifold. In Sec 5 we\r
analyze and visualize the local model of D2 on a cyclic permutation slice. In Sec 6 we describe the visualization\r
of the holonomy. Finally, in Sec 7 and Sec 8 we give discussion and conclusions."""

hold simultaneously. The first condition is equivalent to ||v1 || = ||v2 ||, and the second is the orthogonality\r

With these preparations in hand, we now state the main result of this section.\r
Theorem 3.6 (Determinant factorization for sedenion left multiplication). For any v in S, the determinant\r
Delta(v) := det M(v)\r
of the left multiplication matrix can be factorized as\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4 D2 (v)2\r
.\r
In particular, v != 0 is a zero divisor if and only if D2 (v) = 0.\r
Proof. Write v = v1 + v2e8 and set\r
a := ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
, b := ||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
, c := <v1, v2>.\r
These correspond to D1, D2 in Definition 3.1 via\r
D1 (v) = a, D2 (v) = b\r
2 + 4c2\r
.\r
(1) Reduction to invariants. The automorphism group G2 of the octonions preserves the norm and inner\r
product and also preserves the Cayley-Dickson multiplication and left multiplication matrices (see, for\r
example, Baez [1], Bryant [8], and Moreno [3]). Extending the action to S \u001B O + O by\r
g(v1 + v2e8) := gv1 + gv2e8\r
5

for g in G2, we obtain an orthogonal transformation on S. Moreover, using the fact that g is an automorphism\r
of O and commutes with conjugation, we have\r
g\r
\r
(v1 + v2e8) (w1 + w2e8)\r
\u0001\r
= g(v1w1 - w2v2) + g(v2w1 + w2v1)e8\r
= (gv1) (gw1) - gw2 (gv2) + (gv2) gw1 + (gw2) (gv1)\r
\u0001\r
e8\r
= (gv1 + gv2e8) (gw1 + gw2e8).\r
Thus g is an algebra automorphism on S, and there exists an orthogonal matrix Tg such that\r
M(gv) = TgM(v)T\r
-1\r
g\r
,\r
and hence\r
Delta(gv) = det(TgM(v)T\r
-1\r
g\r
) = Delta(v).\r
This shows that Delta is a G2-invariant polynomial in (v1, v2).\r
On the other hand, ||v1 ||\r
2 + ||v2 ||2\r
, ||v1 ||\r
2 - ||v2 ||2\r
, and <v1, v2> are natural quadratic invariants of the\r
diagonal G2-action (cf. Moreno [3]). Hence Delta(v1, v2) can be expressed as a polynomial in these quantities,\r
so there exists a polynomial G such that\r
Delta(v) = G(a, b, c).\r
Next we consider homogeneity. Since Lsv = sLv for s in R, we have\r
Delta(sv) = det(sM(v)) = s\r
16Delta(v).\r
On the other hand, a, b, c are all scaled by a factor of s\r
2\r
, so\r
G(s\r
2\r
a, s2b, s2c) = s\r
16G(a, b, c)\r
is required. Thus G is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8.\r
(2) Constraints from symmetry. Consider the operation of swapping v1 and v2:\r
(v1, v2) ->--> (v2, v1).\r
This is an orthogonal transformation on S \u001B O + O, and the corresponding left multiplication matrices are\r
similar, hence\r
Delta(v1, v2) = Delta(v2, v1).\r
Under this operation, a and c are invariant, while b changes sign:\r
(a, b, c) ->--> (a, -b, c).\r
Thus G(a, b, c) = G(a, -b, c), i.e., G is an even function of b.\r
Similarly, consider (v1, v2) ->-> (v1, -v2). This is again an orthogonal transformation on S, and since the\r
corresponding left multiplication matrices are related by similarity, we have\r
Delta(v1, -v2) = Delta(v1, v2).\r
Under this operation, a and b are invariant and c ->-> -c, so G(a, b, c) = G(a, b, -c), i.e., G is an even\r
function of c.\r
It follows that G is even in b and c, so it can be written as a polynomial in b\r

Theorem 4.4 (Structure of the set of zero divisors). Let S be the sedenion algebra obtained from the\r
Cayley-Dickson construction and write elements as v = (v1, v2) with v1, v2 in O. Let Z subset S \\ {0} be the set\r
of nontrivial left zero divisors (which we simply call zero divisors in this section).\r
Then Z admits a natural smooth manifold structure of dimension 14, and there is a natural diffeomorphism\r
Z \u001B (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r

where V2 (R\r
8\r

8\r
.\r

Proof. We use the notation v = (v1, v2) in S = O + O. Recall from Corollary 3.7 that a nonzero element\r
v in S is a left zero divisor if and only if\r
||v1 || = ||v2 || and <v1, v2> = 0. (2)\r
In particular, for a zero divisor we have ||v1 ||\r
2 = ||v2 ||2 > 0, so both v1 and v2 are nonzero.\r
Let Z subset S \\ {0} be the set of nontrivial left zero divisors. We first construct an explicit bijection\r
Phi : (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) --> Z.\r
Step 1: Definition of the map. For (r, (u1, u2)) in (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
), define\r
Phi(r, (u1, u2)) := (ru1, ru2) in S.\r
Here we identify O with R\r
8\r
in the usual way. Since (u1, u2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
), we have ||u1 || = ||u2 || = 1 and\r
<u1, u2> = 0. Therefore\r
||ru1 || = r, ||ru2 || = r, <ru1, ru2> = r\r
2\r
<u1, u2> = 0.\r
By the characterization (2), Phi(r, (u1, u2)) is a (nontrivial) left zero divisor. Thus Phi indeed maps into Z.\r
Step 2: Surjectivity. Let v = (v1, v2) in Z be an arbitrary nontrivial left zero divisor. Then by (2) we have\r
||v1 || = ||v2 || =: r > 0, <v1, v2> = 0.\r
Define\r
u1 :=\r
v1\r
r\r
, u2 :=\r
v2\r
r\r
.\r
Then ||u1 || = ||u2 || = 1 and <u1, u2> =\r
1\r
r\r
2\r
<v1, v2> = 0, so (u1, u2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
). Clearly\r
v = (v1, v2) = (ru1, ru2) = Phir, (u1, u2)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Thus Phi is surjective.\r
Step 3: Injectivity. Suppose\r
Phi\r
\r
r, (u1, u2)\r
\u0001\r
= Phis, (w1, w2)\r
\u0001\r
,\r
i.e. (ru1, ru2) = (sw1, sw2) for some r, s in (0, infinity) and (u1, u2), (w1, w2) in V2 (R\r
8\r
). Then\r
ru1 = sw1, ru2 = sw2.\r
Taking norms and using ||u1 || = ||w1 || = 1, we obtain\r
r = ||ru1 || = ||sw1 || = s.\r
Hence r = s, and it follows that u1 = w1 and u2 = w2. Thus (u1, u2) = (w1, w2) and Phi is injective.\r
Step 4: Smoothness and manifold structure. The map\r
Phi : (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) -> S \\ {0}\r
is clearly smooth, being polynomial in the coordinates. Its inverse\r
Psi : Z --> (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
), Psi(v1, v2) :=\r
\u0010\r
||v1 ||,\r
\r
v1\r
||v1 ||\r
,\r
v2\r
||v2 ||\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
is well-defined on Z, because (2) implies ||v1 || = ||v2 || > 0 and hence both v1 and v2 are nonzero. It is\r
also smooth, as it is given by smooth algebraic operations (in particular, division by a positive scalar). Thus\r
Phi is a diffeomorphism between (0, infinity) x V2 (R\r
8\r
) and Z, which endows Z with a natural smooth manifold\r
structure.\r
Since dimV2 (R\r
8\r
) = 2 * 8 -\r
2*3\r
2\r
= 13, we obtain\r
dim Z = 1 + dimV2 (R\r
8\r
) = 14.\r
Because S \\ {0} has dimension 16, the set Z has codimension 2 in S \\ {0}. box\r

via the above two-step rule simply applies the ambient update and then orthogonally projects back to\r
Tv1 (t+Deltat) S\r
7 before renormalizing, so it acts as a discrete approximation of parallel transport on E.\r
Geometrically, this procedure can be interpreted as follows: when v1 rotates slightly, v2 is rotated as\r
little as possible so that it remains of unit length and orthogonal to the new v1.\r
Lemma 6.2 (Preservation of orthonormality). If (v1 (t), v2 (t)) in E is updated to (v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat))\r
according to Definition 6.1, then (v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)) in E holds; that is,\r
||v1 (t + Deltat) || = ||v2 (t + Deltat) || = 1, <v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)> = 0\r
are preserved.\r
Proof. We assume by construction that v1 (t + Deltat) has norm 1. From the definition of ~v2 we have\r
<v~2, v1 (t + Deltat)> = <v2 (t), v1 (t + Deltat)> - <v2 (t), v1 (t + Deltat)><v1 (t + Deltat), v1 (t + Deltat)>\r
= 0,\r
so ~v2 is orthogonal to v1 (t+Deltat). Since v2 (t+Deltat) is obtained by normalizing ~v2, we have both ||v2 (t+Deltat) || = 1\r
and <v1 (t + Deltat), v2 (t + Deltat)> = 0. box\r
This update rule can be regarded as an Euler discretization of the induced connection on E when\r
embedded into R\r
16\r
.\r
Proposition 6.3 (First-order approximation of the Levi-Civita connection). In the limit Deltat -> 0, the update\r
rule in Definition 6.1 approximates the parallel transport induced by the Levi-Civita connection on E to\r
first order.\r
Sketch of proof. The Levi-Civita parallel transport on S\r
7 preserves length while staying in the tangent space\r
and is characterized by minimizing rotation. On E \u001B V2 (R\r
8\r
), the tangent space satisfies\r
v2 perp v1, < v2, v2> = 0,\r
and the Levi-Civita connection again chooses v2 so that the frame evolves with minimal rotation.\r
In Definition 6.1, v1 is updated along a curve on S\r
7\r
, and then v2 is projected orthogonally onto the new\r
tangent space Tv1 (t+Deltat) S\r
7\r
and renormalized. This is precisely the projection formula used in the definition\r
of the induced connection on an embedded submanifold. Ultimately, differentiating the discrete update rule\r
with respect to t and comparing with the defining equation for Levi-Civita parallel transport shows that the\r
error is of order O(Deltat\r
2\r
), hence the approximation is first-order accurate. For conciseness, we omit the full\r

as a point on the torus whenever  is defined. In the numerical experiments underlying Proposition 6.5,\r
the chosen initial frame has v2 (0) projecting nontrivially to the e0-e1 plane, and the projection remained\r
nonzero throughout the simulation, so the fiber angle was well-defined along the sampled loop.\r
In the numerical experiment, we choose v1 (t) to be the great circle in the e0-e1 plane,\r
v1 (t) = (cost, sin t, 0, . . . , 0), t in [0, 2].\r
We take Deltat sufficiently small, update v2 (tk) according to Definition 6.1, and compute ((tk), (tk)) at each\r
step.\r
Plotting the point sequence ((tk), (tk)) in the unit square [0, 2) x [0, 2) while identifying opposite\r
edges as a torus, we obtain a nearly diagonal closed curve shown in Figure 3. This suggests that when the\r
base loop winds once, the fiber angle also winds approximately once, indicating a (1, 1)-type holonomy.\r

base angle  is on the horizontal axis and the fiber angle  on the vertical axis. The curve appears as an\r
essentially (1, 1)-type closed curve, winding once in each direction as the base loop closes. (Numerical\r
parameters: num steps = 400, seed=42.)\r
15

To evaluate the holonomy more quantitatively, we define an unwrapped fiber angle ~(t) by removing 2\r
jumps from (t), and plot it as a function of (t). Figure 4 shows this plot, with  on the horizontal axis\r
and ~ on the vertical axis. A least-squares linear fit yields\r
~() approx  + const.,\r
indicating a linear relation with slope close to 1.\r
Observation 6.5 (Numerical holonomy for the great circle). For the base loop v1 (t) = (cost,sin t, 0, . . . , 0)\r
and the discrete parallel transport scheme in Definition 6.1, the numerically observed holonomy transfor\u0002mation exhibits the following qualitative behaviour:\r
(i) it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the oriented two-plane spanned by the zero-divisor frame (v1, v2);\r
(ii) it is close to the identity on the orthogonal complement of this two-plane.\r
In other words, the holonomy is typically of (1, 1)-type with respect to the decompositionR\r
8 = span{v1, v2}+\r
span{v1, v2}\r
perp, and the unwrapped slope ~() approx  + const. provides numerical evidence for this behaviour.\r
Remark 6.6. We emphasize that Observation 6.5 is based solely on numerical experiments using a simple\r
Euler integrator for the Levi-Civita connection. At present we do not claim a rigorous theorem asserting\r
that the holonomy is exactly of (1, 1)-type for the true Levi-Civita connection on the sedenionic zero-divisor\r
frame manifold; we regard these computations as evidence for such behaviour and as motivation for future\r
analytic work.\r
Lemma 6.7 (Toy model for (1, 1)-type holonomy). Consider the flat product manifold M := (S\r
1 xS1\r
) xR\r
k\r
with the standard product metric, and let E -> M be the trivial rank-n bundle with the Levi-Civita\r
connection induced from the ambient Euclidean space R\r
n\r
. Fix an orthogonal decomposition R\r
n = U + Uperp\r
with dimU = 2, and suppose that along M the subbundle U is tangent to the S\r
1 x S1-directions while Uperp\r
is constant.\r
Then the holonomy of the Levi-Civita connection along any fundamental loop of S\r
1 x S1\r
is a rotation\r
in U and the identity on U\r
perp. In particular, the holonomy is of (1, 1)-type with respect to the decomposition\r
U + U\r
perp.\r
Proof sketch. Since the metric on M is flat and of product type, the Levi-Civita connection on T M is trivial\r
in the R\r
k-directions and reduces to the standard flat connection on each S1\r
factor. The bundle E is trivial\r
with the constant splitting E = U + U\r
perp, and by assumption the connection preserves both subbundles.\r
Along a fundamental loop in one S\r
1-direction, the parallel transport in Uperp is therefore the identity, while\r
in U it is given by a rotation of some angle (completely determined by the chosen frame along S\r
1\r
). Since\r
the two S\r
1-directions commute and the connection is flat, the holonomy along any (m, n)-cycle in S1 x S1\r
is again a pure rotation in U and the identity on U\r
perp. box\r
Remark 6.8. Lemma 6.7 should be viewed only as a simplified caricature of the situation on the genuine\r
zero-divisor frame manifold, where the metric is curved and the splitting into the zero-divisor plane and its\r
orthogonal complement is not globally parallel. However, our numerical experiments suggest that, at least\r
along the torus-type loops considered in this section, the qualitative (1, 1)-type behaviour of the holonomy\r
persists. We regard this as evidence that the zero-divisor frame manifold inherits a geometric structure\r
reminiscent of the toy model above.\r
In the numerical experiments underlying Observation 6.5, we choose a generic initial frame (v1 (0), v2 (0)) in\r
E with v2 (0) having a nonzero projection to the base e0-e1 plane. We vary the time discretization param\u0002eter Deltat = 2/num steps with num steps in {100, 200, 400, 800} and find that the least-squares slope k in\r
~() approx k + const. remains stably close to 1 (typically k = 1.00 +/- 10-3). This indicates that the observed\r
(1, 1)-type holonomy is not an artifact of a particular discretization or initial condition.\r
The curvature tensor of the induced Levi-Civita connection on the Stiefel manifold V2 (R\r
8\r
) is homoge\u0002neous under the SO(8)-action. The observed (1, 1)-type holonomy can be regarded as a concrete example\r
of an area-proportional phase caused by this curvature, analogous to the Berry phase in physics (cf. do\r
Carmo [12]). In this paper we confine ourselves to this qualitative discussion; a more detailed computation\r
of the curvature and its representation-theoretic description are left as future work.\r

the orange line is a linear fit. The slope is approximately 1, indicating that the holonomy is a (1, 1)-type\r

In this paper we have constructed fundamental factors D1, D2 of the determinant of the sedenion left\r
multiplication matrix,\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
and shown that D2 is the quartic polynomial that vanishes exactly under the geometric conditions\r
||v1 || = ||v2 ||, <v1, v2> = 0.\r
This gives a characterization of nonzero zero divisors via D2 (v) = 0. The geometric condition itself is\r
consistent with previous works such as Moreno [3] on zero divisors in Cayley-Dickson algebras, but the\r
present work is distinctive in providing it as an explicit determinant factor D2 in a form that can be directly\r
used for local modeling and visualization.\r
On the cyclic permutation slice, D2 simplifies to\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
,\r
so that its zero set is the quadratic cone XY + Y Z + Z X = 0. This is a concrete example showing that the\r
local structure of the zero-divisor set can be described as the zero set of a quadratic form in an appropriate\r
coordinate system. The slice used here is chosen as a typical model of reduction by the action of G2 and\r
scalar rescaling. An important future problem is to clarify, via the structure of G2-orbits and normal forms,\r
to what extent this quadratic cone model appears universally for general zero divisors.\r
We have also introduced a discrete Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold\r
E \u001B V2 (R\r
8\r
) and visualized its holonomy as curves on a torus. The observation that the holonomy of the\r
base great circle loop forms a (1, 1)-type closed curve suggests that the zero-divisor frame bundle has a\r
geometric structure that twists once per loop. The discretization adopted here can be seen as a numerical\r
approximation of a natural SO(8)-invariant connection, but since the sedenion multiplication is closely\r
related to the action of the exceptional group G2, it is expected that comparing the holonomy with the\r
standard representation of SO(8) and its restriction to G2 will yield a more algebraic understanding. In\r
this paper we do not go into these details and focus instead on visualization and observation, but a more\r
systematic analysis of the curvature tensor and representation-theoretic structure is an important direction\r
for future work.\r
From a symmetry viewpoint, the observed (1, 1)-type holonomy is also natural. The Stiefel manifold\r
V2 (R\r
8\r
) can be regarded as the homogeneous space SO(8)/SO(6) equipped with the SO(8)-invariant\r
Riemannian metric, and the Levi-Civita connection is uniquely determined by this symmetry. Our base\r
17

loop v1 (t) = (cost,sin t, 0, . . . , 0) arises from the action of a one-parameter subgroup SO(2) subset SO(8)\r
rotating the e0-e1 plane. In such a highly symmetric situation, there is essentially a unique natural scale\r
for the holonomy along one full rotation, and the simplest nontrivial possibility is that the frame twists\r
once when the base vector rotates once. The numerically observed slope ~() approx  + const. can therefore\r
be interpreted as a manifestation of this SO(8)-invariance, analogous to how the holonomy on a sphere is\r
determined solely by the enclosed area of a loop.\r
A natural next step would be to substantiate the observed (1, 1)-type holonomy by a more systematic\r
numerical study. One can investigate the convergence of the slope in Observation 6.5 as the step size\r
Deltat -> 0, the dependence on the initial frame and the great circle choice, and the behavior under global\r
SO(8)-rotations of the entire configuration. Moreover, by deforming the base loop within the e0-e1 plane\r
(e.g. to ellipses) and comparing the resulting holonomy with the enclosed area, it should be possible to\r
test an area law analogous to the Berry phase on spheres. Similar phenomena have been studied in sub\u0002Riemannian visualizations such as Montgomery [13] and Bullo-Lewis [14]. We leave a detailed numerical\r
and theoretical analysis of these questions to future work."""

In this paper, we have visualized and analyzed the geometric structure of the sedenion zero-divisor set along\r

satisfies\r
Delta(v) = D1 (v)\r
4D2 (v)2\r
,\r
and showed that nonzero zero divisors are characterized by the condition D2 (v) = 0.\r
- We analyzed D2 on the cyclic permutation slice and derived the local model\r
D2 (X, Y, Z) = 4(XY + Y Z + Z X)\r
2\r
,\r
confirming via 2D/3D visualization that the local singular structure is given by the quadratic cone\r

- We introduced a discrete Levi-Civita connection on the normalized zero-divisor manifold and visu\u0002alized its holonomy as curves on a torus, thereby observing geometric twisting in the zero-divisor\r

These results constitute a basic attempt to understand the zero-divisor geometry of an abstract nondivi\u0002sion algebra via explicit polynomials and computer graphics. Future directions include extending the analysis\r
to more general slices and higher Cayley-Dickson algebras, comparing different natural G2-invariant con\u0002nections, and elucidating the relations between curvature and topology. In particular, investigating the\r
