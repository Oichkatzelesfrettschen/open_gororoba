THE BASIC SUBALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE CAYLEY-DICKSON\r
ALGEBRA OF DIMENSION 32 (TRIGINTADUONIONS)\r
RAOUL E. CAWAGAS, ET AL*\r
Abstract. The Cayley-Dickson algebras R (real numbers), C (complex num\u0002bers), H (quaternions), O (octonions), S (sedenions) and T (trigintaduonions)\r
have attracted the attention of several mathematicians and theoretical physi\u0002cists because of their important applications in both pure mathematics and\r
theoretical physics. This paper deals with the determination of the basic subal\u0002gebra structure of the algebra T by analyzing the loop TL of order 64 generated\r
by its 32 basis elements. The analysis shows that TL is a non-associative finite\r
invertible loop (NAFIL) with 373 non-trivial subloops of orders 32, 16, 8, 4,\r
and 2 all of which are normal. These subloops generate subalgebras of T of\r
dimensions 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 which form the elements of its structure.\r
1. Introduction\r
The Cayley-Dickson algebras C (complex numbers 2-D), H (quaternions 4-D),\r
O (octonions 8-D), S (sedenions 16-D), and T (trigintaduonions 32-D)1are real\r
algebras obtained from the real numbers R (1-D) by a doubling procedure called\r
the Cayley-Dickson (C-D) process [1, 7]. Thus we have the following C-D doubling\r
chain:\r
R subset C subset H subset O subset S subset T subset ...\r
This shows that the trigintaduonions T contains S, O, H, C, and R as subalgebras.\r
These, however, are not the only subalgebras of T: any subalgebra of S, O, H, and\r
C is also a subalgebra of T as well as others generated by its basis elements.\r
In a previous study [2, 3] we determined (using the software FINITAS [4]) the\r
basic subalgebra structure of the C-D sedenion algebra S of dimension 16. We\r
showed that it contains an embedded loop SL of order 32 (called the standard\r
sedenion loop) generated by its 16 basis elements. Analysis of SL showed that it\r
contains 15 maximal subloops of order 16 all of which are non-abelian NAFILs (non\u0002associative finite invertible loops) [5]. Of these, 8 are isomorphic to the standard\r
octonion loop OL of order 16 generated by the 8 basis elements of O while 7 are\r
isomorphic to a newly identified loop OeL which we called the quasi-octonion loop.\r
Up to isomorphisms, these subloops generate 8-dimensional subalgebras, O and Oe,\r
of the sedenions S.\r

The next C-D algebra in the chain after S is the trigintaduonion algebra T of\r
dimension 32. The captivating thing about T is that all of the well-known real\r
division algebras R, C, H, and O fit nicely inside it as subalgebras. Hence any\r
object involving these algebras can be dealt with in T. Moreover, it also contains\r
the sedenions S and several sedenion-type algebras that have potential applications\r
in pure mathematics and theoretical physics. This is our motivation for studying\r
these algebras.\r
2. Methodology\r
The important question related to the study of any algebra is to know its subal\u0002gebra composition and lattice which determine its structure.\r
This paper presents an attempt to determine the basic subalgebra structure of\r
T by determining the subloop composition and lattice of the loop TL of order 64\r
generated by the 32 basis elements of T. The subloops of TL are of orders 32, 16,\r
8, 4, and 2. These generate subalgebras of T of dimensions 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1,\r
respectively. Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence2 between the subloops of\r
TL and the basic subalgebras of T. Because of this the basic subalgebra composition\r
of T is directly related to that of TL. To complete the description of the structure\r
of TL we must show how its subloops fit inside it and how they are related to each\r
other by determining its subloop lattice; and hence, by the correspondence, also\r
the basic subalgebra lattice of T.\r
2.1. Definitions. In the standard literature the term algebra [1] is taken to mean a\r
finite dimensional vector space over a field F (like R) with a bilinear multiplication\r
(not necessarily associative) and with a unit element. Being a vector space, we can\r
choose a basis in terms of which each element of the algebra can be written as a\r
linear combination of the basis elements. Such an algebra is completely defined by\r
the multiplication rules of its basis by means of a multiplication table. A loop [5], on\r
the other hand, is a binary system satisfying all group axioms but not necessarily\r
the associative property. For finite loops of small order, multiplication is usually\r
defined by a Cayley table.\r
The Cayley-Dickson algebras [1] is a sequence of algebras over the real numbers\r
R, each with twice the dimension of the previous one as indicated by the doubling\r
chain in Section 1. Thus, these algebras have dimensions of the form 2n, where\r
n >= 0 is an integer. Any algebra in the chain contains all of the algebras (and their\r
subalgebras) before it as subalgebras. For n >= 3 such an algebra is not associative.\r
2.2. Notation. In what follows, let the 32 = 25 basis elements of the trigintaduo\u0002nion algebra T be represented by the set TE = {e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31}, where e0 is\r
the unit element. If ei, ej , ek in TE, then ei * ej = +/-ek, where -ek in/ TE. Be\u0002cause of this the set TE is not closed under the operation * of trigintaduonion\r
multiplication since it contains only positive elements. Thus the 32 elements of\r
TE must be extended to include 32 negative elements in T to form the trigin\u0002taduonion loop TL of order 64 = 26\r
. Accordingly, these 64 loop elements will be\r
represented by the set TL = +/-{e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31}. If i = 0, then e0 = 1 (the\r
unit) while if i >= 1, then +/-eiis an imaginary such that (+/-ei)\r
2 = -1. Moreover,\r
(-ei) * (ej ) = ei * (-ej ) = -(ei * ej ).\r
2This correspondnece can be considered as a form of duality.

2.3. Computer Use. In this study we relied heavily on the use of the computer\r
software FINITAS [4], the LOOPS package for GAP [9], and other programs for\r
the construction and analysis of the various algebraic structures involved.\r
First, the Cayley table of the trigintaduonion loop TL was computer generated\r
by means of a special computer program based on the Cayley-Dickson process. The\r
result is shown in Table 1 which only shows its main portion that corresponds to\r
the multiplication table of the 32 basis elements of T.\r
Next, using the software FINITAS we determined the subloop composition of\r
the trigintaduonion loop TL by generating the Cayley tables of its subloops. We\r
also analyzed TL to determine its basic structural properties (Section 3.5). Then we\r
identified its subloops and classified them into isomorphy classes by subjecting them\r
to isomorphism and other tests. For this, we used both FINITAS and LOOPS3.\r
The data obtained from the various tests conducted were then analyzed.\r
3. Results and Discussions\r
The trigintaduonion algebra T contains an embedded loop TL of order 64 gen\u0002erated by its 32 basis elements. Analysis (using FINITAS) shows that this loop\r
is a NAFIL (non-associative finite invertible loop) with 373 non-trivial subloops of\r
orders m = 32 (31 loops), m = 16 (155 loops), m = 8 (155 loops), m = 4 (31 loops),\r
and m = 2 (1 loop). The subloops of orders 32 and 16 are NAFILs while those of\r
orders 8, 4, and 2 are groups. Moreover, all of these 373 subloops of TL are normal.\r
Such a loop, called a Hamiltonian loop, is known to have a modular lattice [6].\r
Table 1. Main portion of the Cayley table of the trigintaduo\u0002nion loop TL = +/-{e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31} of order m = 64. This por\u0002tion corresponds to the multiplication table of the basis TE =\r
{e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31} of T. Note how S, O, H, and R are contained\r
in T. For convenience of notation, we represent each loop element\r
ei by its subscript i, that is, we set i = ei.\r
3Prof. Michael Kinyon (Denver University, USA) used the LOOPS package to assist us in\r
determining the isomorphy classes of the 31 sedenion-type subloops of TL.

3.1. Subloops of Order 32. The maximal subloops of TL are the 31 subloops\r
of order 32 (called sedenion-type loops). One of these is the "standard" sedenion\r
loop SL generated by the basis of the sedenion algebra S. In addition to SL three\r
more of these 31 sedenion-type loops of order 32 have been identified as distinct\r
(non-isomorphic). In terms of the basis elements of T, we have4:\r
- SL(#2) = +/-{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\r
(std sedenion loop)\r

L\r
(#7) = +/-{0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 20, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31}\r

(gamma-sedenion loop)\r
3.1.1. Isomorphy Classes of Sedenion-type Subloops. Further analysis shows that\r
these four distinct subloops represent exactly four isomorphy classes:\r
- C~={SL(#2)} : -->16 subloops\r
- C~={S\r
alpha\r
L\r
(#7)} : -->7 subloops\r
- C~={S\r
beta\r
L\r
(#10)} : -->7 subloops\r
- C~={S\r
gamma\r
L\r
(#4)} : -->1 subloop\r
This means that each of the 31 sedenion-type subloops of TL belongs to just one,\r
and only one, of these classes. Up to isomorphism, it can be shown that the subloops\r
SL, Salpha\r
L\r
, Sbeta\r
L\r
, Sgamma\r
L\r
of TL generate subalgebras S, S\r
alpha, Sbeta\r
, S\r
gamma of T.\r
The Cayley tables of SL, Salpha\r
L\r
, Sbeta\r
L\r
, and S\r
gamma\r
L\r
are shown in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5.\r
Like Table 1, these Cayley tables only show their main portions; these correspond\r
to the multiplication tables of the subalgebras S, S\r
alpha, Sbeta\r
, and S\r
gamma of T.\r

of order n = 32.\r

n = 32.\r
Remark 1. The Cayley table of the loop TL (Table 1) of order 64 has 64 rows\r
and 64 columns consisting of four portions (partitions) each with 32 rows and 32\r
columns. Such a table is somewhat large and we only show its main portion: the\r
multiplication table of the basis TE of T. Similarly, Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 only show\r
their main portions.

3.2. Subloops of order 16. Analysis shows that TL has 155 subloops of order 16.\r
These are octonion-type NAFIL loops that form exactly two isomorphy classes:\r
- C~={OL} of octonion loops [Class representative: #5 = +/-{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}]\r
= 50 loops\r
- C~={OeL} of quasi-octonion loops [Class representative: #11 = +/-{0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15}]\r
= 105 loops\r
Thus, every octonion-type loop either belongs to the class C~={OL} or to the class\r
C~={OeL}. These are the maximal subloops of the sedenion-type loops.\r
3.3. Subloops of Order 8, 4, and 2. The subloops of order 8, 4, and 2 are all\r
groups. Analysis shows that all of the 155 subloops of order m = 8 are groups\r
isomorphic to the quaternion group Q8. On the other hand, the 31 subloops of\r
order m = 4 are groups isomorphic to the cyclic group C4; the lone subloop of\r
order m = 2 is a group isomorphic to the cyclic group C2. Thus they form the\r
following isomorphy classes:\r
- C~={Q8} of quaternion groups Q8: -->155 subloops\r
- C~={C4} of cyclic groups C4: -->31 subloops\r
- C~={C2} of cyclic group C2: -->1 subloop\r
3.4. The Isomorphy Classes of the Subloops of TL. We have now identified\r
all of the 9 isomorphy classes of the 373 non-trivial subloops of TL :\r
- C~={SL}, C~={S\r
alpha\r
L\r
}, C~={S\r
beta\r
L\r
}, C~={S\r
gamma\r
L\r
}, C~={OL}, C~={OeL}, C~={Q8}, C~={C4},\r
and C~={C2}.\r
where SL, Salpha\r
L\r
, Sbeta\r
L\r
, Sgamma\r
L\r
, OL, OeL, Q8, C4, and C2 are class representatives. Here,\r
SL is the standard sedenion loop of order 32 while S\r
alpha\r
L\r
, Sbeta\r
L\r
, Sgamma\r
L\r
are newly identified\r
loops of order 32. The loop OL of order 16 is the standard octonion loop while\r
OeL is called the quasi-octonion loop of order 16. On the other hand, Q8 is the\r
quaternion group of order 8, C4 is the cyclic group of order 4, and C2 is the cyclic\r
group of order 2.\r
It can be shown that each of the 373 subloops under these classes generate sub\u0002algebras of T. Thus the basic subalgebra composition of the algebra T corresponds\r
to the subloop composition of the loop TL. This also means that each of the subloop\r
isomorphy classes of TL determines a class of isomorphic subalgebras of T.\r
3.5. Maximal Subloop Compositions of Sedenion-Type Loops. Analysis\r
also shows that each of the 31 sedenion-type subloops of TL belong to exactly one\r
of the following three maximal subloop composition types:\r
- [8 OL + 7 OeL] = [8 + 7] :--> 17 subloops\r
- [2 OL + 13 OeL] = [2 + 13] :--> 7 subloops\r
- [0 OL + 15 OeL] = [0 + 15] :--> 7 subloops\r
Thus we find that any sedenion-type loop contains at least 7 quasi-octonion loops\r
OeL as subloops. Table 6 shows the four identified sedenion-type loops in Section\r
3.1 and their subloop composition types.

Table 6. Four distinct (non-isomorphic) sedenion-type loops and\r
their maximal subloop compositions.\r
From this we find that the loops SL, Salpha\r
L\r
, and S\r
beta\r
L\r
differ in their maximal subloop\r
compositions. Hence they are not isomorphic. Note that the loop S\r
gamma\r
L\r
has the\r
same subloop composition as SL but analysis shows that they are not isomorphic.\r
Therefore all of these four subloops are distinct.\r
The sedenion-type loops generate 16-dimensional non-associative real subalge\u0002bras of T with zero divisors [2]. This is due to the fact that (up to isomorphism)\r
each of them contains OeL, and hence Oe as a subalgebra. Such algebras (and their\r
subalgebras) have potential applications in both pure and applied mathematics and\r
in theoretical physics [7, 8].\r
3.6. Properties of TL and its Subloops. All Cayley-Dickson algebras of di\u0002mension D >= 8 are non-associative and non-commutative. Analysis of the loop TL\r
shows that it is a NAFIL that satisfies the following identities (universally quanti\u0002fied equations) listed in Table 7. Naturally, these identities are also satisfied by all\r
subloops of TL (both associative and non-associative).\r

Table 7. Some special loop properties (identities) satisfied by all\r
Cayley-Diction loops of order m >= 16. The trigintaduonion loop TL\r
and its subloops satisfy these identities. The algebra T, however,\r
satisfies only the flexible and power-associative identities.\r
Not all of the identities satisfied by the loop TL listed in Table 7 are satisfied\r
by the algebra T as a whole. Moreover there are identities satisfied only by its\r
subloops. For instance, the octonion loop and the quaternion and cyclic groups\r
satisfy the Moufang identity.\r
3.7. Subloop Lattice of TL. The subloop lattice of TL (and hence the basic\r
subalgebra lattice of T) is determined by its subloop composition. This consists\r
of its 373 subloops classified into 9 isomorphy classes: C~={SL}, C~={S\r
alpha\r
L\r
}, C~={S\r
beta\r
L\r
},\r
C~={S\r
gamma\r
L\r
)}, C~={OL}, C~={OeL}, C~={Q8}, C~={C4}, and C~={C2}.\r
The diagram shown in Figure 1 indicates the general form of the subloop lattice\r
of TL in terms of the isomorphy classes of its subloops. The determination of the\r
complete lattice is a complicated problem that we are now trying to address. So

8 RAOUL E. CAWAGAS, ET AL*\r
far, we know that all subloops of TL are normal. Such a loop has been shown to\r
have a modular lattice [6].\r
Figure 1. Lattice diagram (in block form) of the 9 isomorphy\r
classes of the subloops of the loop TL.\r
4. Summary\r
The Cayley-Dickson algebra T of dimension D = 32 (called the trigintaduonions)\r
contains an embedded NAFIL loop TL of order 64. This loop contains 31 subloops\r
of order 32, 155 of order 16, 155 of order 8, 31 of order 4, and 1 of order 2, all of\r
which are normal. Such a loop is known to have a modular lattice.\r
The subloops of orders 32 (sedenion-type) and 16 (octonion-type) are NAFILs,\r
while those of orders 8, 4, and 2 are groups. These non-trivial subloops of TL are\r
classified into nine isomorphy classes: C~={SL}, C~={S\r
alpha\r
L\r
}, C~={S\r
beta\r
L\r
}, C~={S\r
gamma\r
L\r
} C~={OL},\r
C~={OeL}, C~={Q8}, C~={C4}, and C~={C2}.\r
It can be shown that these subloops of TL of orders 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 generate\r
subalgebras of T of dimensions 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. Hence the basic\r
subalgebra structure of T is directly related to the subloop structure of TL.\r
Up to isomorphism, the octonion-type subloops of TL have the same subloop\r
composition: 7 quaternion groups Q8, 7 cyclic groups C4, and 1 cyclic group C2.\r
Nevertheless, they differ in many fundamental aspects (e.g. OL.satisfies the Mo\u0002ufang identity while OeL does not).\r
The 31 maximal subloops of order 32 form 4 isomorphy classes and 3 distinct\r
maximal subloop composition types: [8 OL + 7 OeL], [2 OL + 13 OeL], and [0 OL +

THE SUBALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE TRIGINTADUONIONS 9\r
15 OeL]. This shows that (up to isomorphism) every sedenion-type loop contains at\r
least 7 quasi-octonion loops as subloops.\r
All 16-dimensional subalgebras of the trigintaduonions T (like S, S\r
alpha, Sbeta\r
,and S\r
gamma\r
)\r
have zero divisors. Except for S, these interesting algebraic structures have not\r
been previously identified. To date not much is known about these algebras and\r
it is therefore a challenge to determine their structural features and their possible\r
applications.\r
The lattice of the isomorphy classes of the subloops of TL is now known (Figure\r
1). However, the complete subloop lattice of TL has not yet been determined. This\r
aspect of the problem is now being studied.\r
Remark 2. A recent review of the literature has shown that S. Catto and D. Chesley\r
( Twisted octonions and their symmetry groups, Nuclear Physics Proceedings Sup\u0002plements, Volume 6, p. 428-432) have independently identified the quasi-octonions\r
which they have called the "twisted octonions." Their approach to this problem is\r
different from our method: it is based on the analysis of quaternion triples. How\u0002ever, their results agree with our own findings. Robert de Marrais ( The 42 As\u0002sessors and the Box-Kites they Fly: Diagonal axis-pairs systems of zero-divisors\r
in the Sedenions, http://arXiv.org/abs/math.GM/0011260) has also been studying\r
the Cayley-Dickson algebras using a different method which he calls the Box-Kites\r
approach.\r

THE BASIC SUBALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE CAYLEY-DICKSON\r
ALGEBRA OF DIMENSION 32 (TRIGINTADUONIONS)\r
RAOUL E. CAWAGAS, ET AL*\r
Abstract. The Cayley-Dickson algebras R (real numbers), C (complex num\u0002bers), H (quaternions), O (octonions), S (sedenions) and T (trigintaduonions)\r
have attracted the attention of several mathematicians and theoretical physi\u0002cists because of their important applications in both pure mathematics and\r
theoretical physics. This paper deals with the determination of the basic subal\u0002gebra structure of the algebra T by analyzing the loop TL of order 64 generated\r
by its 32 basis elements. The analysis shows that TL is a non-associative finite\r
invertible loop (NAFIL) with 373 non-trivial subloops of orders 32, 16, 8, 4,\r
and 2 all of which are normal. These subloops generate subalgebras of T of\r
dimensions 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 which form the elements of its structure."""

The Cayley-Dickson algebras C (complex numbers 2-D), H (quaternions 4-D),\r
O (octonions 8-D), S (sedenions 16-D), and T (trigintaduonions 32-D)1are real\r
algebras obtained from the real numbers R (1-D) by a doubling procedure called\r
the Cayley-Dickson (C-D) process [1, 7]. Thus we have the following C-D doubling\r
chain:\r
R subset C subset H subset O subset S subset T subset ...\r
This shows that the trigintaduonions T contains S, O, H, C, and R as subalgebras.\r
These, however, are not the only subalgebras of T: any subalgebra of S, O, H, and\r
C is also a subalgebra of T as well as others generated by its basis elements.\r
In a previous study [2, 3] we determined (using the software FINITAS [4]) the\r
basic subalgebra structure of the C-D sedenion algebra S of dimension 16. We\r
showed that it contains an embedded loop SL of order 32 (called the standard\r
sedenion loop) generated by its 16 basis elements. Analysis of SL showed that it\r
contains 15 maximal subloops of order 16 all of which are non-abelian NAFILs (non\u0002associative finite invertible loops) [5]. Of these, 8 are isomorphic to the standard\r
octonion loop OL of order 16 generated by the 8 basis elements of O while 7 are\r
isomorphic to a newly identified loop OeL which we called the quasi-octonion loop.\r
Up to isomorphisms, these subloops generate 8-dimensional subalgebras, O and Oe,\r
of the sedenions S.\r

The important question related to the study of any algebra is to know its subal\u0002gebra composition and lattice which determine its structure.\r
This paper presents an attempt to determine the basic subalgebra structure of\r

generated by the 32 basis elements of T. The subloops of TL are of orders 32, 16,\r

TL and the basic subalgebras of T. Because of this the basic subalgebra composition\r
of T is directly related to that of TL. To complete the description of the structure\r
of TL we must show how its subloops fit inside it and how they are related to each\r
other by determining its subloop lattice; and hence, by the correspondence, also\r

finite dimensional vector space over a field F (like R) with a bilinear multiplication\r
(not necessarily associative) and with a unit element. Being a vector space, we can\r
choose a basis in terms of which each element of the algebra can be written as a\r
linear combination of the basis elements. Such an algebra is completely defined by\r
the multiplication rules of its basis by means of a multiplication table. A loop [5], on\r
the other hand, is a binary system satisfying all group axioms but not necessarily\r
the associative property. For finite loops of small order, multiplication is usually\r
defined by a Cayley table.\r
The Cayley-Dickson algebras [1] is a sequence of algebras over the real numbers\r
R, each with twice the dimension of the previous one as indicated by the doubling\r
chain in Section 1. Thus, these algebras have dimensions of the form 2n, where\r
n >= 0 is an integer. Any algebra in the chain contains all of the algebras (and their\r
subalgebras) before it as subalgebras. For n >= 3 such an algebra is not associative.\r
2.2. Notation. In what follows, let the 32 = 25 basis elements of the trigintaduo\u0002nion algebra T be represented by the set TE = {e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31}, where e0 is\r
the unit element. If ei, ej , ek in TE, then ei * ej = +/-ek, where -ek in/ TE. Be\u0002cause of this the set TE is not closed under the operation * of trigintaduonion\r
multiplication since it contains only positive elements. Thus the 32 elements of\r
TE must be extended to include 32 negative elements in T to form the trigin\u0002taduonion loop TL of order 64 = 26\r
. Accordingly, these 64 loop elements will be\r
represented by the set TL = +/-{e0, e1, e2, e3, ..., e31}. If i = 0, then e0 = 1 (the\r
unit) while if i >= 1, then +/-eiis an imaginary such that (+/-ei)\r
2 = -1. Moreover,\r
(-ei) * (ej ) = ei * (-ej ) = -(ei * ej ).\r
