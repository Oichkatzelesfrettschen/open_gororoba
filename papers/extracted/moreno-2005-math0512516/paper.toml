Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra monomorphisms from\r
Am = R\r
2m\r
into An = R\r
2\r
n\r
for 1 <= m <= n, where An are the Cayley-Dickson\r
algebras. For n >= 4, we show that there are many types of monomorphisms\r
and we describe them in terms of the zero divisors in An.\r

Introduction: The Cayley-Dickson algebras An over the real numbers is an\r
algebra structure on R\r
2\r
n\r
= An for n >= 0.\r
By definition the Cayley-Dickson algebras (C-D algebras) are given by\r
doubling process of Dickson [D].\r
For (a, b) and (x, y) in An x An, define the product in An+1 = An x An\r
as follows:\r
(a, b) * (x, y) = (ax - yb, ya + bx).\r
So if A0 = R and x = x for all x in R then A1 = C the complex numbers\r
A2 = H the quaternion numbers and A3 = o the octonion numbers.\r
As is well known An is commutative for n <= 1; associative for n <= 2 and\r
alternative for n <= 3, also An is normed for n <= 3.\r
For n >= 4 An is flexible and has zero divisors [Mo1].\r
Let Aut(An) be the automorphism group of the algebra An.\r
As is well known\r
Aut(A1) = Z/2 = { Identity, Conjugation}.\r
Aut(A2) = SO(3) the rotation group in R\r
3\r
Aut(A3) = G2 the exceptional Lie group.\r
(See [H-Y] and [Wh]).\r
For n >= 4, Eakin-Sathaye showed that\r
Aut(An) = Aut(An-1) x\r
P\r
3\r
.\r
Where P\r
3\r
is the symmetric group of order 6.\r
(See [E-K] and [Mo2]).\r
In this paper we will extend the above results in the following sense:\r
Suppose that 1 <= m <= n.\r
By definition an algebra monomorphism  : Am -> An is a linear monomor\u0002phism such that (i) (e0) = e0 and (ii) (xy) = (x)(y) for all x and y in\r
Am where e0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) is the unit element in Am and An respectively.\r
We will describe the set\r
M(Am, An) = { : Am -> An| algebra monomorphism}.\r
We will see that this set is more complicated to describe for n >= 4.\r
For n <= 3 we will recover known results about the relationship between\r
Aut(An) and the Stiefel manifolds V2n-1,2.\r
For n >= 3, recall that {e0, e1, . . . , e2n-1} denotes the canonical basis in\r
An and that the doubling process is given by\r
An+1 = An + Anee0\r
2

where ~e0 := e2n (half of the way basic in An+1).\r
For  in M(Am; An+1) for n >= 3,\r
 is of type I if e2n = ~e0 in (Im) subset An+1 and  is of type II if also\r
e2n-1 := epsilon in (Im) subset An+1.\r
The main result of this paper is Theorem 2.5: the set of type II monomor\u0002phisms from A3 to An+1 can be described by the set of zero divisors in An+1\r
for n >= 4.\r
Sec 1. Pure and doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Throughout this paper we will stablish the following notational conven\u0002tions:Elements in An will be denoted by Latin characters a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z.\r
Elements in An+1 will be denoted by Greek characters alpha, beta, gamma, . . . For exam\u0002ple,\r
alpha = (a, b) in An x An.\r
When we need to represent elements in An as elements in An-1 x An-1\r
we use subscripts, for instance, a = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2), and so on, with\r
a1, a2, b1, b2 in An-1.\r
Now {e0, e1, . . . , e2n-1} denotes the canonical basis in An. Then by the\r
doubling process\r
{(e0, 0),(e1, 0), . . . ,(e2n-1, 0),(0, e0), . . . ,(0, e2n-1)}\r
is the canonical basis in An+1 = An xAn. By standard abuse of notation, we\r
denote, also e0 = (e0, 0), e1 = (e1, 0), . . . , e2n-1 = (e2n-1, 0),\r
e2n = (0, e0), . . . , e2n+1-1 = (0, e2n-1) in An+1.\r
For alpha = (a, b) in An x An = An+1 we denote alphae = (-b, a) (the complexifi\u0002cation of alpha) so ee0 = (0, e0) and alphaee0 = (a, b)(0, e0) = (-b, a) = alphae. Notice that\r
ealphae = -alpha.\r
The trace on An+1 is the linear map tn+1 : An+1 -> R given by tn+1(alpha) =\r
alpha + alpha = 2(real part of alpha) so tn+1(alpha) = tn(a) when alpha = (a, b) in An x An.\r
Definition: alpha = (a, b) in An+1 is pure if\r
tn+1(alpha) = tn(a) = 0.\r
3

alpha = (a, b) in An+1 is doubly pure if it is pure and also tn(b) = 0; i.e., alphae is\r
pure in An+1.\r
Also 2ha, bi = tn(ab) for h,i the inner product in R\r
2\r
n\r
(see [Mo1]).\r
Notice that for a and b pure elements a perp b if and only if ab = -ba.\r
Notation: Im(An) = {eo}\r
perp subset An is the vector subspace consisting of pure\r
elements in An; i.e., Im(An) = Ker(tn) = R\r
2\r
n-1\r
.\r
Aen+1 = Im(An) x Im(An) = {e0, ee0}\r
perp = R\r
2\r
n+1-2\r
is the vector subspace\r
consisting of doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Lemma 1.1. For a and b in Afn we have that\r
1) aee0 = ea and ee0a = -ea.\r
2) aea = -||a||2ee0 and eaa = ||a||2ee0 so a perp ea.\r
3) eab = -abe with a a pure element.\r
4) a perp b if and only if eab + eba = 0.\r
5) ea perp b if and only if ab = ebea.\r
6) eab = aeb if and only if a perp b and ea perp b.\r
Proof: Notice that a is pure if a = -a and if a = (a1, a2) is doubly pure,\r
then a1 = -a1 and a2 = -a2.\r
1) ee0a = (0, e0)(a1, a2) = (-a2, a1) = (a2, -a1) = -(-a2, a1) = -ea.\r
2) aea = (a1, a2)(-a2, a1) = (-a1a2 + a1a2, a2\r
1 + a\r
2\r
2\r
) = (0, -||a||2e0) =\r
-||a||2ee0.\r
Similarly eaa = (-a2, a1)(a1, a2) = (-a2a1 + a2a1, -a\r
2\r
2 - a\r
2\r
1\r
) = ||a||2ee0.\r
Now, since -2hea, ai = aea + eaa = 0 we have a perp ea.\r
3) eab = (-a2, a1)(b1, b2) = (-a2b1 + b2a1, -b2a2 - a1b1).\r
So eeab = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 - a2b1) = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = ab then -eab = ab. e\r
Notice that in this proof we only use that a1 = -a1; i.e., a is pure and\r
b doubly pure.\r
4

4) a perp b <=> ab + ba = 0 <=> ab = -ba <=> abe = -ba. e\r
<=> -eab = eba <=> eab + eba = 0 by (3).\r
5) ea perp b <=> eeab + ebea = 0 (by (4)) <=> -ab + ebea = 0.\r
6) If ea perp b and a perp b, then by (3) and (4) eab = -abe = bae = -eba = aeb.\r
Conversely, put a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) in An-1 x An-1 and define\r
c := (a1b1 + b2a2) and d := (b2a1 - a2b1) in An-1.\r
Then aeb = (a1, a2)(-b2, b1) = (-a1b2+b1a2, b1a1+a2b2) so aeb = (-d, c).\r
Now ab = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 - a2b1) = (c, d), so abe = (-d, c)\r
and then eab = (d, -c).\r
Thus, if aeb = eab then c = -c and d = -d. Then\r
tn(ab) = tn-1(c) = c + c = 0 and a perp b\r
tn(eab) = tn-1(d) = d + d = 0 and ea perp b.\r
Q.E.D\r
Corollary 1.2 For each a 6= 0 in Aen. The four dimensional vector subspace\r
generated by {e0, ea, a, ee0} is a copy of A2 = H.(We denote it by Ha).\r
Proof: We suppose that ||a|| = 1, otherwise we take a\r
||a||. Construct the\r
following multiplication table.\r
e0 ea a ee0\r
e0 e0 ea a ee0\r
ea ea -e0 +ee0 -a\r
a a -ee0 -e0 ea\r
ee0 a ee0 -ea -e0\r
By lemma 2.1. aee0 = ea; ee0a = -ea; eaee0 = eea = -a; ee0ea = -eea = a;\r
aea = -ee0 and eaa = ee0.\r
But this is the multiplication table of A2 = H identifying e0 <-> 1, ea <-> ^i,\r
a <-> ^j and ee0 <-> ^k.\r

Sec  2. Monomorphism from Am to An.\r
Throughout this chapter 1 <= m <= n.\r
Definition. An algebra monomorphism from Am to An is a linear monomor\u0002phism  : Am -> An such that\r
i) (e0) = e0 (the first e0 is in Am and the second e0 in An)\r
ii) (xy) = (x)(y) for all x and y in Am.\r
By definition we have that (re0) = r(e0) for all r in R so\r
(Im(Am)) subset (Im(An)) and (x) = (x).\r
Therefore ||(x)||2 = (x)(x) = (x)(x) = (xx) = (||x||2\r
) = ||x||2\r
for all x in Am and ||(x)|| = ||x|| and  is an orthogonal linear transforma\u0002tion from R\r
2m-1\r
to R\r
2\r
n-1\r
.\r
The trivial monomorphism is the one given by (x) = (x, 0, 0, . . . , 0) for\r
x in Am and 0 in Am (2n-m-1-times).\r
M(Am, An) denotes the set of algebra monomorphisms from Am to An.\r
For m = n, M(Am; An) = Aut(An) the group of algebra automorphisms\r
of An\r
Proposition 2.1. M(A1; An) = S(Im(An)) = S\r
2\r
n-2\r
.\r
Proof: A1 = C = Span{e0, e1}.\r
If x in A1 then x = re0 + se1 and for w in Im(An) with ||w|| = 1 we have\r
that w(x) = re0+sw define an algebra monomorphism from A1 to An. This\r
can be seen by direct calculations, recalling that, Center (An) = R for all n\r
and that every associator with one real entrie vanish.\r
w(x)w(y) = (re0 + sw)(pe0 + qw) = (rp + sqw2)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= (rp - sq)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= w(x)w(y)\r
when y = pe0 + qe1 and p and q in R. Clearly w(e0) = e0.\r
Conversely, for  in M(A1; An), set w = (e1) in An so ||w|| = 1 and\r
w = .\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: In particular, we have that\r
Aut(A1) = S\r
0 = Z/2 = {Identity, conjugation} = {e1\r
, -e1}.\r

To calculate M(A2; An) for n >= 2 we need to recall (see [Mo2]).\r
Definition: For a and b in An. We said that a alternate with b, we denote\r
it by a b, if (a, a, b) = 0.\r
We said that a alternate strongly with b, we denote it by a ! b, if\r
(a, a, b) = 0 and (a, b, b) = 0.\r
Clearly a alternate strongly with e0 for all a in An and if a and b are\r
linearly dependent then a ! b (by flexibility).\r
Also,by definition,a is an alternative element if and only if a x for all\r
x in An.\r
By Lemma 1.1 (1) and (2) we have that for any doubly pure element a in\r
An (a, a, e~0) = 0 and (by the above remarks) ~e0 alternate strongly with any\r
a in An.\r
For a and b pure elements in An, we define the vector subspace of An\r
V (a; b) = Span{e0, a, b, ab}.\r
Also we identify the Stiefel manifold V2n-1,2 as\r
{(a, b) in Im(An) x Im(An)|a perp b, ||a|| = ||b|| = 1}\r
Lemma 2.2. If (a, b) in V2n-1,2 and a ! b then V (a; b) = A2 = H the\r
quaternions.\r
Proof: Suppose that (a, b) in V2n-1,2 and that (a, a, b) = 0 then we have\r
hab, ai = hb, aai = hb, ||a||2\r
e0i = ||a||2hb, e0i = 0\r
hab, ai = ha, bbi = ha, ||b||2\r
e0i = ||b||2ha, e0i = 0\r
||ab||2 = hab, abi = ha(ab), bi = h-a(ab), bi = h-a\r
2\r
b, bi\r
= -a\r
2\r
hb, bi = ||a||2||b||2 = 1\r
so {e0, a, b, ab} is an orthonormal set of vectors in An.\r
Finally using also that (a, b, b) = 0 and ab = -ba we may check by direct\r
calculations that the multiplication table of {e0, a, b, ab} coincides with the\r
one of the quaternions and by the identification e0 7-> e0, a 7-> e1, b 7-> e2 and\r
ab 7-> e3 we have an algebra isomorphism between A2 = H and V (a; b).\r
Q.E. D.\r
Proposition 2.3. M(A2; An) = {(a, b) in V2n-1,2|a ! b} for n >= 2.\r
7

In particular\r
Aut(A2) = M(A2; A2) = V3,2 = SO(3)\r
and\r
M(A2, A3) = V7,2.\r
Proof. The inclusion "supset" follows from Lemma 2.2. Conversely suppose that\r
 in M(A2, An) then (e0) = e0,((e1), (e2)) in V2n-1,2 and\r
V ((e1), (e2)) = Im = H subset An.\r
Since A2 is an associative algebra and A3 is an alternative algebra we\r
have that a ! b for any two elements in An for n = 2 or n = 3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. Recall that A~\r
n = {e0, e~0}\r
perp = R\r
2\r
n-2\r
denotes the vector subspace\r
of doubly pure elements. Since a ! e~0 for any element in A~\r
n, we have\r
that, if a in S(A~\r
n) i.e., ||a|| = 1 then (a, e~0) in V2n-1,2 and the assignment\r
a 7-> (a, e~0) define an inclusion from S(A~\r
n) = S\r
2\r
n-3\r
-> M(A2; An) subset V2n-1,2\r
which resembles "the bottom cell" inclusion in V2n-1,2.\r
To deal with the cases 3 = m <= n we have to use the notion of a\r
special triple (see [Wh] and [Mo1]).\r
Definition: A set {a, b, c} in Im(An) is a special triple if\r
(i) {a, b, c} is an orthonormal set\r
(ii) a ! b, a ! c and b ! c i.e. its elements alternate strongly,\r
pairwise.\r
(iii) c in V (a; b)\r
perp subset An.\r
Now is easy to see that if {a, b, c} is a special triple then V (a; b); V (a, c); V (b, c)\r
are isomorphic to A2.\r
For a special triple {a, b, c} consider the following vector subspace of An\r
o(a; b; c) := Span{e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c}.\r
Proposition 2.4: For a special triple {a, b, c} in An and n >= 3; o(a, b, c) is\r
an eight-dimensional vector subspace isomorphic, as algebra, to A3 = o the\r
octonions and M(A3, An) = {(a, b, c) in (An)\r
3\r
|{a, b, c} special triple}.\r
Proof: We know that all elements in {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} are of norm\r
one and also\r
hc(ab), ai = -hab, aci = ha(ab), ci = ha\r
2\r
b, ci = a\r
2\r
hb, ci = 0.\r
8

Similarly (c(ab)) perp b and (c(ab)) perp c. Thus {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} is an\r
orthonormal set of vectors and o(a; b; c) is eight-dimensional. To see that\r
o(a; b; c) ~= A3 we have to construct the corresponding multiplication ta\u0002ble,which is, a routine calculation.(See [Mo2])\r
Conversely, if  in M(A3, An) then a = (e1), b = (e2) and c = (e7)\r
form an special triple, when {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} is the canonical basis\r
in A3, and we recall that e1e2 = e3, e7e3 = e4, e7e2 = e5 and e1e7 = e6 in A3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. For n = 3, A3 is an alternative algebra so a special triple in A3 is\r
every triple such that\r
(i) {a, b, c} is orthonormal\r
(ii) c perp (ab).\r
So Proposition 4.4 gives the construction of G2 = Aut(A3) as in [Wh] and\r
the assignment\r
G2 = Aut(A3)\r
pi-> M(A2, A3) = V7,2\r
(a, b, c) 7-> (a, b)\r
is the known fibration G2\r
pi-> V7,2 with fiber S\r
3\r
.\r
Remark. Suppose that n >= 4 and that {a, b, c} is a special triple in An so\r
o(a; b; c) is the image of some algebra monomorphism from A3 to An and any\r
orthonormal triple {x, y, z} of pure elements in o(a; b; c) with z perp (xy) is also\r
a special triple in An and\r
o(x; y; z) = o(a; b; c).\r
Definition: For 1 <= m <= n.  in M(Am, An) is a type I monomorphism if\r
ee0 in (Image of ) subset AAn.\r
Since ~e0 = e2n-1 in AAn then the trivial monomorphism is not a type I\r
monomorphism unless n = m, because by definition its image is generated\r
by {e0, e1, . . . , e2m-1-1}.\r
Denote by M1(AAm; AAn) = { in M(AAm; AAn)|e~0 in (Im)} the sub\u0002set of all type I monomorphisms, clearly M1(AAn, AAn) = M(AAn; AAn) =\r
Aut(AAn).\r
Using proposition 2.1 we may verify that for n >= 2.\r
M1(AA1, AAn) = {re0 + se~0|r\r
2 + s2 = 1} = S1\r
.\r
9

Also,by Lemma 2.2, for a non-zero a in A~An we have that V (a; ~e0) = AHa\r
and\r
M1(AA2; AAn) = S(A~An) = S\r
2\r
n-3\r
. In particular\r
S\r
5 = M1(AA2; AA3) subset M(AA2; AA3) = V7,2\r
is "the bottom cell" of V7,2.\r
Also we can check,using the fact that a e~0 for all a in A~An, that\r
M1(AA3; AAn) = M(AA2; AAn) cap V2n-2,2\r
where V2n-2,2 = {(a, b) in V2n-1,2|a and b are in A~An}.\r
Definition: A type I monomorphism  in M1(AAm; AAn+1) is of type II if\r
e2n-1 := epsilon in (Im ) subset AAn+1.\r
By definition if  in M1(AAm; AAn+1) then ~e0 in (Im ) subset AAn+1 and\r
if we also assume that epsilon in (Im) subset AAn+1 then epsilone~0 = ~epsilon and AHepsilon :=\r
Span{e0, epsilon, epsilon, ~ e~0} lies in (Im ) subset AAn+1; therefore\r
 in M(AAm, AAn+1) is of type II if and only if AHepsilon subset (Im ).\r
Denote M2(AAm, AAn+1) = { in M(AAm; AAn+1)| is type II}.\r
Theorem 2.5 For n >= 3.\r
M2(AA3; AAn+1) = ACP2\r
n-1-1 cup Xn\r
where ACP m is the complex projective space in AC\r
m and\r
Xn = {(x, y) in AAn x AAn|xy = 0, x 6= 0 and y 6= 0}.\r
In particular for n = 3 X3 = Phi (empty set) and M2(AA3; AA4) = ACP3.\r
Proof: Suppose that  : AA3 -> AAn+1 is an algebra monomorphism for\r
n >= 3 with AHepsilon subset (Im ). So Im  is isomorphic to AO = AA3, as algebras,\r
then there is a non-zero alpha in AH\r
perp\r
epsilon subset A~\r
n+1 such that\r
Im  = AOalpha := Span{e0, epsilon, epsilon, ~ e~0, alpha, alphaepsilon, ~ epsilonalpha, alpha ~ } subset AAn+1\r
10

Suppose that alpha = (a, b) in A~An x A~An = AH\r
perp\r
epsilon subset AAn+1 and that a 6= 0\r
(similarly we may assume b 6= 0).\r
Now Im  = AOalpha = AA3 if and only if\r
(alpha, alpha, epsilon) := alpha\r
2\r
epsilon - alpha(alphaepsilon) = 0 i.e. - ||alpha||2epsilon = alpha(alphaepsilon).\r
Using Lemma 1.1 we have that\r
alpha(alphaepsilon) = (a, b)[(a, b)(~e0, 0)] = (a, b)[(~a, -~b)] =\r
= (aa~ - ~bb, -~ba - ba~) = (-||a||2e~0 - ||b||2e~0, 0) - (0,(be~0)a - b(~e0a))\r
= -||alpha||2epsilon + (0,(a, e~0, b)).\r
Therefore (a, e~0, b) = 0 in AAn if and only if (alpha, alpha, epsilon) = 0 in AAn+1.\r
Since AAn = AHa + AH\r
perp\r
a we have that b = c + d where c in AHa and\r
d in AH\r
perp\r
a with c doubly pure i.e., c in Span{a, a~} subset AHa.\r
Since AHa is associative we have that\r
(a, e~0, b) = (a, e~0, c + d) = (a, e~0, c) + (a, e~0, d) = 0 + (a, e~0, d)\r
= (a, e~0, d) = ~ad + a\r
~d = 2~ad\r
by Lemma 1.1 (1), (2) and (6).\r
Therefore (alpha, alpha, epsilon) = 0 in AAn+1 if and only if ad = ~ad = 0 in AAn.\r
So, we have two cases: namely d = 0 and d 6= 0 in AAn.\r
Suppose d = 0. Thus b = c in AHa and b in Span{a, a~} so (a, b) determine\r
a complex line in A~An = R\r
2\r
n-2 = AC\r
2\r
n-1-1\r
and alpha in ACP2\r
n-1-1\r
.\r
Suppose d 6= 0 (so b 6= 0 and a 6= 0).\r
Thus ad = 0 and (a, d) in Xn.\r

(See [E-K] and [Mo2]).\r
In this paper we will extend the above results in the following sense:\r
Suppose that 1 <= m <= n.\r
By definition an algebra monomorphism  : Am -> An is a linear monomor\u0002phism such that (i) (e0) = e0 and (ii) (xy) = (x)(y) for all x and y in\r
Am where e0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) is the unit element in Am and An respectively.\r
We will describe the set\r
M(Am, An) = { : Am -> An| algebra monomorphism}.\r
We will see that this set is more complicated to describe for n >= 4.\r
For n <= 3 we will recover known results about the relationship between\r
Aut(An) and the Stiefel manifolds V2n-1,2.\r
For n >= 3, recall that {e0, e1, . . . , e2n-1} denotes the canonical basis in\r
An and that the doubling process is given by\r
An+1 = An + Anee0\r
2

where ~e0 := e2n (half of the way basic in An+1).\r
For  in M(Am; An+1) for n >= 3,\r
 is of type I if e2n = ~e0 in (Im) subset An+1 and  is of type II if also\r
e2n-1 := epsilon in (Im) subset An+1.\r
The main result of this paper is Theorem 2.5: the set of type II monomor\u0002phisms from A3 to An+1 can be described by the set of zero divisors in An+1\r
for n >= 4.\r
Sec 1. Pure and doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Throughout this paper we will stablish the following notational conven\u0002tions:Elements in An will be denoted by Latin characters a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z.\r
Elements in An+1 will be denoted by Greek characters alpha, beta, gamma, . . . For exam\u0002ple,\r
alpha = (a, b) in An x An.\r
When we need to represent elements in An as elements in An-1 x An-1\r
we use subscripts, for instance, a = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2), and so on, with\r
a1, a2, b1, b2 in An-1.\r
Now {e0, e1, . . . , e2n-1} denotes the canonical basis in An. Then by the\r
doubling process\r
{(e0, 0),(e1, 0), . . . ,(e2n-1, 0),(0, e0), . . . ,(0, e2n-1)}\r
is the canonical basis in An+1 = An xAn. By standard abuse of notation, we\r
denote, also e0 = (e0, 0), e1 = (e1, 0), . . . , e2n-1 = (e2n-1, 0),\r
e2n = (0, e0), . . . , e2n+1-1 = (0, e2n-1) in An+1.\r
For alpha = (a, b) in An x An = An+1 we denote alphae = (-b, a) (the complexifi\u0002cation of alpha) so ee0 = (0, e0) and alphaee0 = (a, b)(0, e0) = (-b, a) = alphae. Notice that\r
ealphae = -alpha.\r
The trace on An+1 is the linear map tn+1 : An+1 -> R given by tn+1(alpha) =\r
alpha + alpha = 2(real part of alpha) so tn+1(alpha) = tn(a) when alpha = (a, b) in An x An.\r
Definition: alpha = (a, b) in An+1 is pure if\r
tn+1(alpha) = tn(a) = 0.\r
3

alpha = (a, b) in An+1 is doubly pure if it is pure and also tn(b) = 0; i.e., alphae is\r
pure in An+1.\r
Also 2ha, bi = tn(ab) for h,i the inner product in R\r
2\r
n\r
(see [Mo1]).\r
Notice that for a and b pure elements a perp b if and only if ab = -ba.\r
Notation: Im(An) = {eo}\r
perp subset An is the vector subspace consisting of pure\r
elements in An; i.e., Im(An) = Ker(tn) = R\r
2\r
n-1\r
.\r
Aen+1 = Im(An) x Im(An) = {e0, ee0}\r
perp = R\r
2\r
n+1-2\r
is the vector subspace\r
consisting of doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Lemma 1.1. For a and b in Afn we have that\r
1) aee0 = ea and ee0a = -ea.\r
2) aea = -||a||2ee0 and eaa = ||a||2ee0 so a perp ea.\r
3) eab = -abe with a a pure element.\r
4) a perp b if and only if eab + eba = 0.\r
5) ea perp b if and only if ab = ebea.\r
6) eab = aeb if and only if a perp b and ea perp b.\r
Proof: Notice that a is pure if a = -a and if a = (a1, a2) is doubly pure,\r
then a1 = -a1 and a2 = -a2.\r
1) ee0a = (0, e0)(a1, a2) = (-a2, a1) = (a2, -a1) = -(-a2, a1) = -ea.\r
2) aea = (a1, a2)(-a2, a1) = (-a1a2 + a1a2, a2\r
1 + a\r
2\r
2\r
) = (0, -||a||2e0) =\r
-||a||2ee0.\r
Similarly eaa = (-a2, a1)(a1, a2) = (-a2a1 + a2a1, -a\r
2\r
2 - a\r
2\r
1\r
) = ||a||2ee0.\r
Now, since -2hea, ai = aea + eaa = 0 we have a perp ea.\r
3) eab = (-a2, a1)(b1, b2) = (-a2b1 + b2a1, -b2a2 - a1b1).\r
So eeab = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 - a2b1) = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = ab then -eab = ab. e\r
Notice that in this proof we only use that a1 = -a1; i.e., a is pure and\r
b doubly pure.\r

4) a perp b <=> ab + ba = 0 <=> ab = -ba <=> abe = -ba. e\r
<=> -eab = eba <=> eab + eba = 0 by (3).\r
5) ea perp b <=> eeab + ebea = 0 (by (4)) <=> -ab + ebea = 0.\r
6) If ea perp b and a perp b, then by (3) and (4) eab = -abe = bae = -eba = aeb.\r
Conversely, put a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) in An-1 x An-1 and define\r
c := (a1b1 + b2a2) and d := (b2a1 - a2b1) in An-1.\r
Then aeb = (a1, a2)(-b2, b1) = (-a1b2+b1a2, b1a1+a2b2) so aeb = (-d, c).\r
Now ab = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 - a2b1) = (c, d), so abe = (-d, c)\r
and then eab = (d, -c).\r
Thus, if aeb = eab then c = -c and d = -d. Then\r
tn(ab) = tn-1(c) = c + c = 0 and a perp b\r
tn(eab) = tn-1(d) = d + d = 0 and ea perp b.\r
Q.E.D\r
Corollary 1.2 For each a 6= 0 in Aen. The four dimensional vector subspace\r
generated by {e0, ea, a, ee0} is a copy of A2 = H.(We denote it by Ha).\r
Proof: We suppose that ||a|| = 1, otherwise we take a\r
||a||. Construct the\r
following multiplication table.\r
e0 ea a ee0\r
e0 e0 ea a ee0\r
ea ea -e0 +ee0 -a\r
a a -ee0 -e0 ea\r
ee0 a ee0 -ea -e0\r
By lemma 2.1. aee0 = ea; ee0a = -ea; eaee0 = eea = -a; ee0ea = -eea = a;\r
aea = -ee0 and eaa = ee0.\r
But this is the multiplication table of A2 = H identifying e0 <-> 1, ea <-> ^i,\r
a <-> ^j and ee0 <-> ^k.\r

Sec  2. Monomorphism from Am to An.\r
Throughout this chapter 1 <= m <= n.\r
Definition. An algebra monomorphism from Am to An is a linear monomor\u0002phism  : Am -> An such that\r
i) (e0) = e0 (the first e0 is in Am and the second e0 in An)\r
ii) (xy) = (x)(y) for all x and y in Am.\r
By definition we have that (re0) = r(e0) for all r in R so\r
(Im(Am)) subset (Im(An)) and (x) = (x).\r
Therefore ||(x)||2 = (x)(x) = (x)(x) = (xx) = (||x||2\r
) = ||x||2\r
for all x in Am and ||(x)|| = ||x|| and  is an orthogonal linear transforma\u0002tion from R\r
2m-1\r
to R\r
2\r
n-1\r
.\r
The trivial monomorphism is the one given by (x) = (x, 0, 0, . . . , 0) for\r
x in Am and 0 in Am (2n-m-1-times).\r
M(Am, An) denotes the set of algebra monomorphisms from Am to An.\r
For m = n, M(Am; An) = Aut(An) the group of algebra automorphisms\r
of An\r
Proposition 2.1. M(A1; An) = S(Im(An)) = S\r
2\r
n-2\r
.\r
Proof: A1 = C = Span{e0, e1}.\r
If x in A1 then x = re0 + se1 and for w in Im(An) with ||w|| = 1 we have\r
that w(x) = re0+sw define an algebra monomorphism from A1 to An. This\r
can be seen by direct calculations, recalling that, Center (An) = R for all n\r
and that every associator with one real entrie vanish.\r
w(x)w(y) = (re0 + sw)(pe0 + qw) = (rp + sqw2)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= (rp - sq)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= w(x)w(y)\r
when y = pe0 + qe1 and p and q in R. Clearly w(e0) = e0.\r
Conversely, for  in M(A1; An), set w = (e1) in An so ||w|| = 1 and\r
w = .\r

Aut(A1) = S\r

Definition: For a and b in An. We said that a alternate with b, we denote\r
it by a b, if (a, a, b) = 0.\r
We said that a alternate strongly with b, we denote it by a ! b, if\r
(a, a, b) = 0 and (a, b, b) = 0.\r
Clearly a alternate strongly with e0 for all a in An and if a and b are\r
linearly dependent then a ! b (by flexibility).\r
Also,by definition,a is an alternative element if and only if a x for all\r
x in An.\r
By Lemma 1.1 (1) and (2) we have that for any doubly pure element a in\r
An (a, a, e~0) = 0 and (by the above remarks) ~e0 alternate strongly with any\r
a in An.\r
For a and b pure elements in An, we define the vector subspace of An\r
V (a; b) = Span{e0, a, b, ab}.\r
Also we identify the Stiefel manifold V2n-1,2 as\r
{(a, b) in Im(An) x Im(An)|a perp b, ||a|| = ||b|| = 1}\r
Lemma 2.2. If (a, b) in V2n-1,2 and a ! b then V (a; b) = A2 = H the\r
quaternions.\r
Proof: Suppose that (a, b) in V2n-1,2 and that (a, a, b) = 0 then we have\r
hab, ai = hb, aai = hb, ||a||2\r
e0i = ||a||2hb, e0i = 0\r
hab, ai = ha, bbi = ha, ||b||2\r
e0i = ||b||2ha, e0i = 0\r
||ab||2 = hab, abi = ha(ab), bi = h-a(ab), bi = h-a\r
2\r
b, bi\r
= -a\r
2\r
hb, bi = ||a||2||b||2 = 1\r
so {e0, a, b, ab} is an orthonormal set of vectors in An.\r
Finally using also that (a, b, b) = 0 and ab = -ba we may check by direct\r
calculations that the multiplication table of {e0, a, b, ab} coincides with the\r
one of the quaternions and by the identification e0 7-> e0, a 7-> e1, b 7-> e2 and\r
ab 7-> e3 we have an algebra isomorphism between A2 = H and V (a; b).\r

Aut(A2) = M(A2; A2) = V3,2 = SO(3)\r

M(A2, A3) = V7,2.\r
Proof. The inclusion "supset" follows from Lemma 2.2. Conversely suppose that\r
 in M(A2, An) then (e0) = e0,((e1), (e2)) in V2n-1,2 and\r
V ((e1), (e2)) = Im = H subset An.\r
Since A2 is an associative algebra and A3 is an alternative algebra we\r
have that a ! b for any two elements in An for n = 2 or n = 3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. Recall that A~\r
n = {e0, e~0}\r
perp = R\r
2\r
n-2\r
denotes the vector subspace\r
of doubly pure elements. Since a ! e~0 for any element in A~\r
n, we have\r
that, if a in S(A~\r
n) i.e., ||a|| = 1 then (a, e~0) in V2n-1,2 and the assignment\r
a 7-> (a, e~0) define an inclusion from S(A~\r
n) = S\r
2\r
n-3\r
-> M(A2; An) subset V2n-1,2\r
which resembles "the bottom cell" inclusion in V2n-1,2.\r
To deal with the cases 3 = m <= n we have to use the notion of a\r
special triple (see [Wh] and [Mo1]).\r
Definition: A set {a, b, c} in Im(An) is a special triple if\r
(i) {a, b, c} is an orthonormal set\r
(ii) a ! b, a ! c and b ! c i.e. its elements alternate strongly,\r
pairwise.\r
(iii) c in V (a; b)\r
perp subset An.\r
Now is easy to see that if {a, b, c} is a special triple then V (a; b); V (a, c); V (b, c)\r
are isomorphic to A2.\r
For a special triple {a, b, c} consider the following vector subspace of An\r
o(a; b; c) := Span{e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c}.\r
Proposition 2.4: For a special triple {a, b, c} in An and n >= 3; o(a, b, c) is\r
an eight-dimensional vector subspace isomorphic, as algebra, to A3 = o the\r
octonions and M(A3, An) = {(a, b, c) in (An)\r
3\r
|{a, b, c} special triple}.\r
Proof: We know that all elements in {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} are of norm\r
one and also\r
hc(ab), ai = -hab, aci = ha(ab), ci = ha\r
2\r
b, ci = a\r
2\r
hb, ci = 0.\r

Similarly (c(ab)) perp b and (c(ab)) perp c. Thus {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} is an\r
orthonormal set of vectors and o(a; b; c) is eight-dimensional. To see that\r
o(a; b; c) ~= A3 we have to construct the corresponding multiplication ta\u0002ble,which is, a routine calculation.(See [Mo2])\r
Conversely, if  in M(A3, An) then a = (e1), b = (e2) and c = (e7)\r
form an special triple, when {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} is the canonical basis\r
in A3, and we recall that e1e2 = e3, e7e3 = e4, e7e2 = e5 and e1e7 = e6 in A3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. For n = 3, A3 is an alternative algebra so a special triple in A3 is\r
every triple such that\r
(i) {a, b, c} is orthonormal\r
(ii) c perp (ab).\r
So Proposition 4.4 gives the construction of G2 = Aut(A3) as in [Wh] and\r
the assignment\r
G2 = Aut(A3)\r
