algebras. For n ≥ 4, we show that there are many types of monomorphisms\r
and we describe them in terms of the zero divisors in An.\r

Introduction: The Cayley-Dickson algebras An over the real numbers is an\r
algebra structure on R\r
2\r
n\r
= An for n ≥ 0.\r
By definition the Cayley-Dickson algebras (C-D algebras) are given by\r
doubling process of Dickson [D].\r
For (a, b) and (x, y) in An × An, define the product in An+1 = An × An\r
as follows:\r
(a, b) · (x, y) = (ax − yb, ya + bx).\r
So if A0 = R and x = x for all x in R then A1 = C the complex numbers\r
A2 = H the quaternion numbers and A3 = ø the octonion numbers.\r
As is well known An is commutative for n ≤ 1; associative for n ≤ 2 and\r
alternative for n ≤ 3, also An is normed for n ≤ 3.\r
For n ≥ 4 An is flexible and has zero divisors [Mo1].\r
Let Aut(An) be the automorphism group of the algebra An.\r
As is well known\r
Aut(A1) = Z/2 = { Identity, Conjugation}.\r
Aut(A2) = SO(3) the rotation group in R\r
3\r
Aut(A3) = G2 the exceptional Lie group.\r
(See [H-Y] and [Wh]).\r
For n ≥ 4, Eakin-Sathaye showed that\r
Aut(An) = Aut(An−1) ×\r
P\r
3\r
.\r
Where P\r
3\r
is the symmetric group of order 6.\r
(See [E-K] and [Mo2]).\r
In this paper we will extend the above results in the following sense:\r
Suppose that 1 ≤ m ≤ n.\r
By definition an algebra monomorphism ϕ : Am → An is a linear monomor\u0002phism such that (i) ϕ(e0) = e0 and (ii) ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y) for all x and y in\r
Am where e0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) is the unit element in Am and An respectively.\r
We will describe the set\r
M(Am, An) = {ϕ : Am → An|ϕ algebra monomorphism}.\r
We will see that this set is more complicated to describe for n ≥ 4.\r
For n ≤ 3 we will recover known results about the relationship between\r
Aut(An) and the Stiefel manifolds V2n−1,2.\r
For n ≥ 3, recall that {e0, e1, . . . , e2n−1} denotes the canonical basis in\r
An and that the doubling process is given by\r
An+1 = An ⊕ Anee0\r
2

where ˜e0 := e2n (half of the way basic in An+1).\r
For ϕ ∈ M(Am; An+1) for n ≥ 3,\r
ϕ is of type I if e2n = ˜e0 ∈ (Imϕ) ⊂ An+1 and ϕ is of type II if also\r
e2n−1 := ε ∈ (Imϕ) ⊂ An+1.\r
The main result of this paper is Theorem 2.5: the set of type II monomor\u0002phisms from A3 to An+1 can be described by the set of zero divisors in An+1\r
for n ≥ 4.\r
§1. Pure and doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Throughout this paper we will stablish the following notational conven\u0002tions:Elements in An will be denoted by Latin characters a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z.\r
Elements in An+1 will be denoted by Greek characters α, β, γ, . . . For exam\u0002ple,\r
α = (a, b) ∈ An × An.\r
When we need to represent elements in An as elements in An−1 × An−1\r
we use subscripts, for instance, a = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2), and so on, with\r
a1, a2, b1, b2 in An−1.\r
Now {e0, e1, . . . , e2n−1} denotes the canonical basis in An. Then by the\r
doubling process\r
{(e0, 0),(e1, 0), . . . ,(e2n−1, 0),(0, e0), . . . ,(0, e2n−1)}\r
is the canonical basis in An+1 = An ×An. By standard abuse of notation, we\r
denote, also e0 = (e0, 0), e1 = (e1, 0), . . . , e2n−1 = (e2n−1, 0),\r
e2n = (0, e0), . . . , e2n+1−1 = (0, e2n−1) in An+1.\r
For α = (a, b) ∈ An × An = An+1 we denote αe = (−b, a) (the complexifi\u0002cation of α) so ee0 = (0, e0) and αee0 = (a, b)(0, e0) = (−b, a) = αe. Notice that\r
eαe = −α.\r
The trace on An+1 is the linear map tn+1 : An+1 → R given by tn+1(α) =\r
α + α = 2(real part of α) so tn+1(α) = tn(a) when α = (a, b) ∈ An × An.\r
Definition: α = (a, b) in An+1 is pure if\r
tn+1(α) = tn(a) = 0.\r
3

α = (a, b) in An+1 is doubly pure if it is pure and also tn(b) = 0; i.e., αe is\r
pure in An+1.\r
Also 2ha, bi = tn(ab) for h,i the inner product in R\r
2\r
n\r
(see [Mo1]).\r
Notice that for a and b pure elements a ⊥ b if and only if ab = −ba.\r
Notation: Im(An) = {eo}\r
⊥ ⊂ An is the vector subspace consisting of pure\r
elements in An; i.e., Im(An) = Ker(tn) = R\r
2\r
n−1\r
.\r
Aen+1 = Im(An) × Im(An) = {e0, ee0}\r
⊥ = R\r
2\r
n+1−2\r
is the vector subspace\r
consisting of doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Lemma 1.1. For a and b in Afn we have that\r
1) aee0 = ea and ee0a = −ea.\r
2) aea = −||a||2ee0 and eaa = ||a||2ee0 so a ⊥ ea.\r
3) eab = −abe with a a pure element.\r
4) a ⊥ b if and only if eab + eba = 0.\r
5) ea ⊥ b if and only if ab = ebea.\r
6) eab = aeb if and only if a ⊥ b and ea ⊥ b.\r
Proof: Notice that a is pure if a = −a and if a = (a1, a2) is doubly pure,\r
then a1 = −a1 and a2 = −a2.\r
1) ee0a = (0, e0)(a1, a2) = (−a2, a1) = (a2, −a1) = −(−a2, a1) = −ea.\r
2) aea = (a1, a2)(−a2, a1) = (−a1a2 + a1a2, a2\r
1 + a\r
2\r
2\r
) = (0, −||a||2e0) =\r
−||a||2ee0.\r
Similarly eaa = (−a2, a1)(a1, a2) = (−a2a1 + a2a1, −a\r
2\r
2 − a\r
2\r
1\r
) = ||a||2ee0.\r
Now, since −2hea, ai = aea + eaa = 0 we have a ⊥ ea.\r
3) eab = (−a2, a1)(b1, b2) = (−a2b1 + b2a1, −b2a2 − a1b1).\r
So eeab = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 − a2b1) = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = ab then −eab = ab. e\r
Notice that in this proof we only use that a1 = −a1; i.e., a is pure and\r
b doubly pure.\r
4

4) a ⊥ b ⇔ ab + ba = 0 ⇔ ab = −ba ⇔ abe = −ba. e\r
⇔ −eab = eba ⇔ eab + eba = 0 by (3).\r
5) ea ⊥ b ⇔ eeab + ebea = 0 (by (4)) ⇔ −ab + ebea = 0.\r
6) If ea ⊥ b and a ⊥ b, then by (3) and (4) eab = −abe = bae = −eba = aeb.\r
Conversely, put a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) in An−1 × An−1 and define\r
c := (a1b1 + b2a2) and d := (b2a1 − a2b1) in An−1.\r
Then aeb = (a1, a2)(−b2, b1) = (−a1b2+b1a2, b1a1+a2b2) so aeb = (−d, c).\r
Now ab = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 − a2b1) = (c, d), so abe = (−d, c)\r
and then eab = (d, −c).\r
Thus, if aeb = eab then c = −c and d = −d. Then\r
tn(ab) = tn−1(c) = c + c = 0 and a ⊥ b\r
tn(eab) = tn−1(d) = d + d = 0 and ea ⊥ b.\r
Q.E.D\r
Corollary 1.2 For each a 6= 0 in Aen. The four dimensional vector subspace\r
generated by {e0, ea, a, ee0} is a copy of A2 = H.(We denote it by Ha).\r
Proof: We suppose that ||a|| = 1, otherwise we take a\r
||a||. Construct the\r
following multiplication table.\r
e0 ea a ee0\r
e0 e0 ea a ee0\r
ea ea −e0 +ee0 −a\r
a a −ee0 −e0 ea\r
ee0 a ee0 −ea −e0\r
By lemma 2.1. aee0 = ea; ee0a = −ea; eaee0 = eea = −a; ee0ea = −eea = a;\r
aea = −ee0 and eaa = ee0.\r
But this is the multiplication table of A2 = H identifying e0 ↔ 1, ea ↔ ˆi,\r
a ↔ ˆj and ee0 ↔ ˆk.\r

§ 2. Monomorphism from Am to An.\r
Throughout this chapter 1 ≤ m ≤ n.\r
Definition. An algebra monomorphism from Am to An is a linear monomor\u0002phism ϕ : Am → An such that\r
i) ϕ(e0) = e0 (the first e0 is in Am and the second e0 in An)\r
ii) ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y) for all x and y in Am.\r
By definition we have that ϕ(re0) = rϕ(e0) for all r in R so\r
ϕ(Im(Am)) ⊂ ϕ(Im(An)) and ϕ(x) = ϕ(x).\r
Therefore ||ϕ(x)||2 = ϕ(x)ϕ(x) = ϕ(x)ϕ(x) = ϕ(xx) = ϕ(||x||2\r
) = ||x||2\r
for all x ∈ Am and ||ϕ(x)|| = ||x|| and ϕ is an orthogonal linear transforma\u0002tion from R\r
2m−1\r
to R\r
2\r
n−1\r
.\r
The trivial monomorphism is the one given by ϕ(x) = (x, 0, 0, . . . , 0) for\r
x ∈ Am and 0 in Am (2n−m−1-times).\r
M(Am, An) denotes the set of algebra monomorphisms from Am to An.\r
For m = n, M(Am; An) = Aut(An) the group of algebra automorphisms\r
of An\r
Proposition 2.1. M(A1; An) = S(Im(An)) = S\r
2\r
n−2\r
.\r
Proof: A1 = C = Span{e0, e1}.\r
If x ∈ A1 then x = re0 + se1 and for w ∈ Im(An) with ||w|| = 1 we have\r
that ϕw(x) = re0+sw define an algebra monomorphism from A1 to An. This\r
can be seen by direct calculations, recalling that, Center (An) = R for all n\r
and that every associator with one real entrie vanish.\r
ϕw(x)ϕw(y) = (re0 + sw)(pe0 + qw) = (rp + sqw2)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= (rp − sq)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= ϕw(x)ϕw(y)\r
when y = pe0 + qe1 and p and q in R. Clearly ϕw(e0) = e0.\r
Conversely, for ϕ ∈ M(A1; An), set w = ϕ(e1) in An so ||w|| = 1 and\r
ϕw = ϕ.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: In particular, we have that\r
Aut(A1) = S\r
0 = Z/2 = {Identity, conjugation} = {ϕe1\r
, ϕ−e1}.\r

To calculate M(A2; An) for n ≥ 2 we need to recall (see [Mo2]).\r
Definition: For a and b in An. We said that a alternate with b, we denote\r
it by a b, if (a, a, b) = 0.\r
We said that a alternate strongly with b, we denote it by a ! b, if\r
(a, a, b) = 0 and (a, b, b) = 0.\r
Clearly a alternate strongly with e0 for all a in An and if a and b are\r
linearly dependent then a ! b (by flexibility).\r
Also,by definition,a is an alternative element if and only if a x for all\r
x in An.\r
By Lemma 1.1 (1) and (2) we have that for any doubly pure element a in\r
An (a, a, e˜0) = 0 and (by the above remarks) ˜e0 alternate strongly with any\r
a in An.\r
For a and b pure elements in An, we define the vector subspace of An\r
V (a; b) = Span{e0, a, b, ab}.\r
Also we identify the Stiefel manifold V2n−1,2 as\r
{(a, b) ∈ Im(An) × Im(An)|a ⊥ b, ||a|| = ||b|| = 1}\r
Lemma 2.2. If (a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2 and a ! b then V (a; b) = A2 = H the\r
quaternions.\r
Proof: Suppose that (a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2 and that (a, a, b) = 0 then we have\r
hab, ai = hb, aai = hb, ||a||2\r
e0i = ||a||2hb, e0i = 0\r
hab, ai = ha, bbi = ha, ||b||2\r
e0i = ||b||2ha, e0i = 0\r
||ab||2 = hab, abi = ha(ab), bi = h−a(ab), bi = h−a\r
2\r
b, bi\r
= −a\r
2\r
hb, bi = ||a||2||b||2 = 1\r
so {e0, a, b, ab} is an orthonormal set of vectors in An.\r
Finally using also that (a, b, b) = 0 and ab = −ba we may check by direct\r
calculations that the multiplication table of {e0, a, b, ab} coincides with the\r
one of the quaternions and by the identification e0 7→ e0, a 7→ e1, b 7→ e2 and\r
ab 7→ e3 we have an algebra isomorphism between A2 = H and V (a; b).\r
Q.E. D.\r
Proposition 2.3. M(A2; An) = {(a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2|a ! b} for n ≥ 2.\r
7

In particular\r
Aut(A2) = M(A2; A2) = V3,2 = SO(3)\r
and\r
M(A2, A3) = V7,2.\r
Proof. The inclusion “⊃” follows from Lemma 2.2. Conversely suppose that\r
ϕ ∈ M(A2, An) then ϕ(e0) = e0,(ϕ(e1), ϕ(e2)) ∈ V2n−1,2 and\r
V (ϕ(e1), ϕ(e2)) = Imϕ = H ⊂ An.\r
Since A2 is an associative algebra and A3 is an alternative algebra we\r
have that a ! b for any two elements in An for n = 2 or n = 3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. Recall that A˜\r
n = {e0, e˜0}\r
⊥ = R\r
2\r
n−2\r
denotes the vector subspace\r
of doubly pure elements. Since a ! e˜0 for any element in A˜\r
n, we have\r
that, if a ∈ S(A˜\r
n) i.e., ||a|| = 1 then (a, e˜0) ∈ V2n−1,2 and the assignment\r
a 7→ (a, e˜0) define an inclusion from S(A˜\r
n) = S\r
2\r
n−3\r
֒→ M(A2; An) ⊂ V2n−1,2\r
which resembles “the bottom cell” inclusion in V2n−1,2.\r
To deal with the cases 3 = m ≤ n we have to use the notion of a\r
special triple (see [Wh] and [Mo1]).\r
Definition: A set {a, b, c} in Im(An) is a special triple if\r
(i) {a, b, c} is an orthonormal set\r
(ii) a ! b, a ! c and b ! c i.e. its elements alternate strongly,\r
pairwise.\r
(iii) c ∈ V (a; b)\r
⊥ ⊂ An.\r
Now is easy to see that if {a, b, c} is a special triple then V (a; b); V (a, c); V (b, c)\r
are isomorphic to A2.\r
For a special triple {a, b, c} consider the following vector subspace of An\r
ø(a; b; c) := Span{e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c}.\r
Proposition 2.4: For a special triple {a, b, c} in An and n ≥ 3; ø(a, b, c) is\r
an eight-dimensional vector subspace isomorphic, as algebra, to A3 = ø the\r
octonions and M(A3, An) = {(a, b, c) ∈ (An)\r
3\r
|{a, b, c} special triple}.\r
Proof: We know that all elements in {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} are of norm\r
one and also\r
hc(ab), ai = −hab, aci = ha(ab), ci = ha\r
2\r
b, ci = a\r
2\r
hb, ci = 0.\r
8

Similarly (c(ab)) ⊥ b and (c(ab)) ⊥ c. Thus {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} is an\r
orthonormal set of vectors and ø(a; b; c) is eight-dimensional. To see that\r
ø(a; b; c) ∼= A3 we have to construct the corresponding multiplication ta\u0002ble,which is, a routine calculation.(See [Mo2])\r
Conversely, if ϕ ∈ M(A3, An) then a = ϕ(e1), b = ϕ(e2) and c = ϕ(e7)\r
form an special triple, when {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} is the canonical basis\r
in A3, and we recall that e1e2 = e3, e7e3 = e4, e7e2 = e5 and e1e7 = e6 in A3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. For n = 3, A3 is an alternative algebra so a special triple in A3 is\r
every triple such that\r
(i) {a, b, c} is orthonormal\r
(ii) c ⊥ (ab).\r
So Proposition 4.4 gives the construction of G2 = Aut(A3) as in [Wh] and\r
the assignment\r
G2 = Aut(A3)\r
π→ M(A2, A3) = V7,2\r
(a, b, c) 7→ (a, b)\r
is the known fibration G2\r
π→ V7,2 with fiber S\r
3\r
.\r
Remark. Suppose that n ≥ 4 and that {a, b, c} is a special triple in An so\r
ø(a; b; c) is the image of some algebra monomorphism from A3 to An and any\r
orthonormal triple {x, y, z} of pure elements in ø(a; b; c) with z ⊥ (xy) is also\r
a special triple in An and\r
ø(x; y; z) = ø(a; b; c).\r
Definition: For 1 ≤ m ≤ n. ϕ ∈ M(Am, An) is a type I monomorphism if\r
ee0 ∈ (Image of ϕ) ⊂ AAn.\r
Since ˜e0 = e2n−1 in AAn then the trivial monomorphism is not a type I\r
monomorphism unless n = m, because by definition its image is generated\r
by {e0, e1, . . . , e2m−1−1}.\r
Denote by M1(AAm; AAn) = {ϕ ∈ M(AAm; AAn)|e˜0 ∈ (Imϕ)} the sub\u0002set of all type I monomorphisms, clearly M1(AAn, AAn) = M(AAn; AAn) =\r
Aut(AAn).\r
Using proposition 2.1 we may verify that for n ≥ 2.\r
M1(AA1, AAn) = {re0 + se˜0|r\r
2 + s2 = 1} = S1\r
.\r
9

Also,by Lemma 2.2, for a non-zero a ∈ A˜An we have that V (a; ˜e0) = AHa\r
and\r
M1(AA2; AAn) = S(A˜An) = S\r
2\r
n−3\r
. In particular\r
S\r
5 = M1(AA2; AA3) ⊂ M(AA2; AA3) = V7,2\r
is “the bottom cell” of V7,2.\r
Also we can check,using the fact that a e˜0 for all a ∈ A˜An, that\r
M1(AA3; AAn) = M(AA2; AAn) ∩ V2n−2,2\r
where V2n−2,2 = {(a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2|a and b are in A˜An}.\r
Definition: A type I monomorphism ϕ ∈ M1(AAm; AAn+1) is of type II if\r
e2n−1 := ε ∈ (Im ϕ) ⊂ AAn+1.\r
By definition if ϕ ∈ M1(AAm; AAn+1) then ˜e0 ∈ (Im ϕ) ⊂ AAn+1 and\r
if we also assume that ε ∈ (Imϕ) ⊂ AAn+1 then εe˜0 = ˜ε and AHε :=\r
Span{e0, ε, ε, ˜ e˜0} lies in (Im ϕ) ⊂ AAn+1; therefore\r
ϕ ∈ M(AAm, AAn+1) is of type II if and only if AHε ⊂ (Im ϕ).\r
Denote M2(AAm, AAn+1) = {ϕ ∈ M(AAm; AAn+1)|ϕ is type II}.\r
Theorem 2.5 For n ≥ 3.\r
M2(AA3; AAn+1) = ACP2\r
n−1−1 ∪ Xn\r
where ACP m is the complex projective space in AC\r
m and\r
Xn = {(x, y) ∈ AAn × AAn|xy = 0, x 6= 0 and y 6= 0}.\r
In particular for n = 3 X3 = Φ (empty set) and M2(AA3; AA4) = ACP3.\r
Proof: Suppose that ϕ : AA3 → AAn+1 is an algebra monomorphism for\r
n ≥ 3 with AHε ⊂ (Im ϕ). So Im ϕ is isomorphic to AO = AA3, as algebras,\r
then there is a non-zero α ∈ AH\r
⊥\r
ε ⊂ A˜\r
n+1 such that\r
Im ϕ = AOα := Span{e0, ε, ε, ˜ e˜0, α, αε, ˜ εα, α ˜ } ⊂ AAn+1\r
10

Suppose that α = (a, b) ∈ A˜An × A˜An = AH\r
⊥\r
ε ⊂ AAn+1 and that a 6= 0\r
(similarly we may assume b 6= 0).\r
Now Im ϕ = AOα = AA3 if and only if\r
(α, α, ε) := α\r
2\r
ε − α(αε) = 0 i.e. − ||α||2ε = α(αε).\r
Using Lemma 1.1 we have that\r
α(αε) = (a, b)[(a, b)(˜e0, 0)] = (a, b)[(˜a, −˜b)] =\r
= (aa˜ − ˜bb, −˜ba − ba˜) = (−||a||2e˜0 − ||b||2e˜0, 0) − (0,(be˜0)a − b(˜e0a))\r
= −||α||2ε + (0,(a, e˜0, b)).\r
Therefore (a, e˜0, b) = 0 in AAn if and only if (α, α, ε) = 0 in AAn+1.\r
Since AAn = AHa ⊕ AH\r
⊥\r
a we have that b = c + d where c ∈ AHa and\r
d ∈ AH\r
⊥\r
a with c doubly pure i.e., c ∈ Span{a, a˜} ⊂ AHa.\r
Since AHa is associative we have that\r
(a, e˜0, b) = (a, e˜0, c + d) = (a, e˜0, c) + (a, e˜0, d) = 0 + (a, e˜0, d)\r
= (a, e˜0, d) = ˜ad + a\r
˜d = 2˜ad\r
by Lemma 1.1 (1), (2) and (6).\r
Therefore (α, α, ε) = 0 in AAn+1 if and only if ad = ˜ad = 0 in AAn.\r
So, we have two cases: namely d = 0 and d 6= 0 in AAn.\r
Suppose d = 0. Thus b = c ∈ AHa and b ∈ Span{a, a˜} so (a, b) determine\r
a complex line in A˜An = R\r
2\r
n−2 = AC\r
2\r
n−1−1\r
and α ∈ ACP2\r
n−1−1\r
.\r
Suppose d 6= 0 (so b 6= 0 and a 6= 0).\r
Thus ad = 0 and (a, d) ∈ Xn.\r

(See [E-K] and [Mo2]).\r
In this paper we will extend the above results in the following sense:\r
Suppose that 1 ≤ m ≤ n.\r
By definition an algebra monomorphism ϕ : Am → An is a linear monomor\u0002phism such that (i) ϕ(e0) = e0 and (ii) ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y) for all x and y in\r
Am where e0 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) is the unit element in Am and An respectively.\r
We will describe the set\r
M(Am, An) = {ϕ : Am → An|ϕ algebra monomorphism}.\r
We will see that this set is more complicated to describe for n ≥ 4.\r
For n ≤ 3 we will recover known results about the relationship between\r
Aut(An) and the Stiefel manifolds V2n−1,2.\r
For n ≥ 3, recall that {e0, e1, . . . , e2n−1} denotes the canonical basis in\r
An and that the doubling process is given by\r
An+1 = An ⊕ Anee0\r
2

where ˜e0 := e2n (half of the way basic in An+1).\r
For ϕ ∈ M(Am; An+1) for n ≥ 3,\r
ϕ is of type I if e2n = ˜e0 ∈ (Imϕ) ⊂ An+1 and ϕ is of type II if also\r
e2n−1 := ε ∈ (Imϕ) ⊂ An+1.\r
The main result of this paper is Theorem 2.5: the set of type II monomor\u0002phisms from A3 to An+1 can be described by the set of zero divisors in An+1\r
for n ≥ 4.\r
§1. Pure and doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Throughout this paper we will stablish the following notational conven\u0002tions:Elements in An will be denoted by Latin characters a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z.\r
Elements in An+1 will be denoted by Greek characters α, β, γ, . . . For exam\u0002ple,\r
α = (a, b) ∈ An × An.\r
When we need to represent elements in An as elements in An−1 × An−1\r
we use subscripts, for instance, a = (a1, a2), b = (b1, b2), and so on, with\r
a1, a2, b1, b2 in An−1.\r
Now {e0, e1, . . . , e2n−1} denotes the canonical basis in An. Then by the\r
doubling process\r
{(e0, 0),(e1, 0), . . . ,(e2n−1, 0),(0, e0), . . . ,(0, e2n−1)}\r
is the canonical basis in An+1 = An ×An. By standard abuse of notation, we\r
denote, also e0 = (e0, 0), e1 = (e1, 0), . . . , e2n−1 = (e2n−1, 0),\r
e2n = (0, e0), . . . , e2n+1−1 = (0, e2n−1) in An+1.\r
For α = (a, b) ∈ An × An = An+1 we denote αe = (−b, a) (the complexifi\u0002cation of α) so ee0 = (0, e0) and αee0 = (a, b)(0, e0) = (−b, a) = αe. Notice that\r
eαe = −α.\r
The trace on An+1 is the linear map tn+1 : An+1 → R given by tn+1(α) =\r
α + α = 2(real part of α) so tn+1(α) = tn(a) when α = (a, b) ∈ An × An.\r
Definition: α = (a, b) in An+1 is pure if\r
tn+1(α) = tn(a) = 0.\r
3

α = (a, b) in An+1 is doubly pure if it is pure and also tn(b) = 0; i.e., αe is\r
pure in An+1.\r
Also 2ha, bi = tn(ab) for h,i the inner product in R\r
2\r
n\r
(see [Mo1]).\r
Notice that for a and b pure elements a ⊥ b if and only if ab = −ba.\r
Notation: Im(An) = {eo}\r
⊥ ⊂ An is the vector subspace consisting of pure\r
elements in An; i.e., Im(An) = Ker(tn) = R\r
2\r
n−1\r
.\r
Aen+1 = Im(An) × Im(An) = {e0, ee0}\r
⊥ = R\r
2\r
n+1−2\r
is the vector subspace\r
consisting of doubly pure elements in An+1.\r
Lemma 1.1. For a and b in Afn we have that\r
1) aee0 = ea and ee0a = −ea.\r
2) aea = −||a||2ee0 and eaa = ||a||2ee0 so a ⊥ ea.\r
3) eab = −abe with a a pure element.\r
4) a ⊥ b if and only if eab + eba = 0.\r
5) ea ⊥ b if and only if ab = ebea.\r
6) eab = aeb if and only if a ⊥ b and ea ⊥ b.\r
Proof: Notice that a is pure if a = −a and if a = (a1, a2) is doubly pure,\r
then a1 = −a1 and a2 = −a2.\r
1) ee0a = (0, e0)(a1, a2) = (−a2, a1) = (a2, −a1) = −(−a2, a1) = −ea.\r
2) aea = (a1, a2)(−a2, a1) = (−a1a2 + a1a2, a2\r
1 + a\r
2\r
2\r
) = (0, −||a||2e0) =\r
−||a||2ee0.\r
Similarly eaa = (−a2, a1)(a1, a2) = (−a2a1 + a2a1, −a\r
2\r
2 − a\r
2\r
1\r
) = ||a||2ee0.\r
Now, since −2hea, ai = aea + eaa = 0 we have a ⊥ ea.\r
3) eab = (−a2, a1)(b1, b2) = (−a2b1 + b2a1, −b2a2 − a1b1).\r
So eeab = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 − a2b1) = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = ab then −eab = ab. e\r
Notice that in this proof we only use that a1 = −a1; i.e., a is pure and\r
b doubly pure.\r

4) a ⊥ b ⇔ ab + ba = 0 ⇔ ab = −ba ⇔ abe = −ba. e\r
⇔ −eab = eba ⇔ eab + eba = 0 by (3).\r
5) ea ⊥ b ⇔ eeab + ebea = 0 (by (4)) ⇔ −ab + ebea = 0.\r
6) If ea ⊥ b and a ⊥ b, then by (3) and (4) eab = −abe = bae = −eba = aeb.\r
Conversely, put a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) in An−1 × An−1 and define\r
c := (a1b1 + b2a2) and d := (b2a1 − a2b1) in An−1.\r
Then aeb = (a1, a2)(−b2, b1) = (−a1b2+b1a2, b1a1+a2b2) so aeb = (−d, c).\r
Now ab = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = (a1b1 + b2a2, b2a1 − a2b1) = (c, d), so abe = (−d, c)\r
and then eab = (d, −c).\r
Thus, if aeb = eab then c = −c and d = −d. Then\r
tn(ab) = tn−1(c) = c + c = 0 and a ⊥ b\r
tn(eab) = tn−1(d) = d + d = 0 and ea ⊥ b.\r
Q.E.D\r
Corollary 1.2 For each a 6= 0 in Aen. The four dimensional vector subspace\r
generated by {e0, ea, a, ee0} is a copy of A2 = H.(We denote it by Ha).\r
Proof: We suppose that ||a|| = 1, otherwise we take a\r
||a||. Construct the\r
following multiplication table.\r
e0 ea a ee0\r
e0 e0 ea a ee0\r
ea ea −e0 +ee0 −a\r
a a −ee0 −e0 ea\r
ee0 a ee0 −ea −e0\r
By lemma 2.1. aee0 = ea; ee0a = −ea; eaee0 = eea = −a; ee0ea = −eea = a;\r
aea = −ee0 and eaa = ee0.\r
But this is the multiplication table of A2 = H identifying e0 ↔ 1, ea ↔ ˆi,\r
a ↔ ˆj and ee0 ↔ ˆk.\r

§ 2. Monomorphism from Am to An.\r
Throughout this chapter 1 ≤ m ≤ n.\r
Definition. An algebra monomorphism from Am to An is a linear monomor\u0002phism ϕ : Am → An such that\r
i) ϕ(e0) = e0 (the first e0 is in Am and the second e0 in An)\r
ii) ϕ(xy) = ϕ(x)ϕ(y) for all x and y in Am.\r
By definition we have that ϕ(re0) = rϕ(e0) for all r in R so\r
ϕ(Im(Am)) ⊂ ϕ(Im(An)) and ϕ(x) = ϕ(x).\r
Therefore ||ϕ(x)||2 = ϕ(x)ϕ(x) = ϕ(x)ϕ(x) = ϕ(xx) = ϕ(||x||2\r
) = ||x||2\r
for all x ∈ Am and ||ϕ(x)|| = ||x|| and ϕ is an orthogonal linear transforma\u0002tion from R\r
2m−1\r
to R\r
2\r
n−1\r
.\r
The trivial monomorphism is the one given by ϕ(x) = (x, 0, 0, . . . , 0) for\r
x ∈ Am and 0 in Am (2n−m−1-times).\r
M(Am, An) denotes the set of algebra monomorphisms from Am to An.\r
For m = n, M(Am; An) = Aut(An) the group of algebra automorphisms\r
of An\r
Proposition 2.1. M(A1; An) = S(Im(An)) = S\r
2\r
n−2\r
.\r
Proof: A1 = C = Span{e0, e1}.\r
If x ∈ A1 then x = re0 + se1 and for w ∈ Im(An) with ||w|| = 1 we have\r
that ϕw(x) = re0+sw define an algebra monomorphism from A1 to An. This\r
can be seen by direct calculations, recalling that, Center (An) = R for all n\r
and that every associator with one real entrie vanish.\r
ϕw(x)ϕw(y) = (re0 + sw)(pe0 + qw) = (rp + sqw2)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= (rp − sq)e0 + (rq + sp)w\r
= ϕw(x)ϕw(y)\r
when y = pe0 + qe1 and p and q in R. Clearly ϕw(e0) = e0.\r
Conversely, for ϕ ∈ M(A1; An), set w = ϕ(e1) in An so ||w|| = 1 and\r
ϕw = ϕ.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: In particular, we have that\r
Aut(A1) = S\r
0 = Z/2 = {Identity, conjugation} = {ϕe1\r
, ϕ−e1}."""

Definition: For a and b in An. We said that a alternate with b, we denote\r
it by a b, if (a, a, b) = 0.\r
We said that a alternate strongly with b, we denote it by a ! b, if\r
(a, a, b) = 0 and (a, b, b) = 0.\r
Clearly a alternate strongly with e0 for all a in An and if a and b are\r
linearly dependent then a ! b (by flexibility).\r
Also,by definition,a is an alternative element if and only if a x for all\r
x in An.\r
By Lemma 1.1 (1) and (2) we have that for any doubly pure element a in\r
An (a, a, e˜0) = 0 and (by the above remarks) ˜e0 alternate strongly with any\r
a in An.\r
For a and b pure elements in An, we define the vector subspace of An\r
V (a; b) = Span{e0, a, b, ab}.\r
Also we identify the Stiefel manifold V2n−1,2 as\r
{(a, b) ∈ Im(An) × Im(An)|a ⊥ b, ||a|| = ||b|| = 1}\r
Lemma 2.2. If (a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2 and a ! b then V (a; b) = A2 = H the\r
quaternions.\r
Proof: Suppose that (a, b) ∈ V2n−1,2 and that (a, a, b) = 0 then we have\r
hab, ai = hb, aai = hb, ||a||2\r
e0i = ||a||2hb, e0i = 0\r
hab, ai = ha, bbi = ha, ||b||2\r
e0i = ||b||2ha, e0i = 0\r
||ab||2 = hab, abi = ha(ab), bi = h−a(ab), bi = h−a\r
2\r
b, bi\r
= −a\r
2\r
hb, bi = ||a||2||b||2 = 1\r
so {e0, a, b, ab} is an orthonormal set of vectors in An.\r
Finally using also that (a, b, b) = 0 and ab = −ba we may check by direct\r
calculations that the multiplication table of {e0, a, b, ab} coincides with the\r
one of the quaternions and by the identification e0 7→ e0, a 7→ e1, b 7→ e2 and\r
ab 7→ e3 we have an algebra isomorphism between A2 = H and V (a; b).\r

Aut(A2) = M(A2; A2) = V3,2 = SO(3)\r
and\r
M(A2, A3) = V7,2.\r
Proof. The inclusion “⊃” follows from Lemma 2.2. Conversely suppose that\r
ϕ ∈ M(A2, An) then ϕ(e0) = e0,(ϕ(e1), ϕ(e2)) ∈ V2n−1,2 and\r
V (ϕ(e1), ϕ(e2)) = Imϕ = H ⊂ An.\r
Since A2 is an associative algebra and A3 is an alternative algebra we\r
have that a ! b for any two elements in An for n = 2 or n = 3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. Recall that A˜\r
n = {e0, e˜0}\r
⊥ = R\r
2\r
n−2\r
denotes the vector subspace\r
of doubly pure elements. Since a ! e˜0 for any element in A˜\r
n, we have\r
that, if a ∈ S(A˜\r
n) i.e., ||a|| = 1 then (a, e˜0) ∈ V2n−1,2 and the assignment\r
a 7→ (a, e˜0) define an inclusion from S(A˜\r
n) = S\r
2\r
n−3\r
֒→ M(A2; An) ⊂ V2n−1,2\r
which resembles “the bottom cell” inclusion in V2n−1,2.\r
To deal with the cases 3 = m ≤ n we have to use the notion of a\r
special triple (see [Wh] and [Mo1]).\r
Definition: A set {a, b, c} in Im(An) is a special triple if\r
(i) {a, b, c} is an orthonormal set\r
(ii) a ! b, a ! c and b ! c i.e. its elements alternate strongly,\r
pairwise.\r
(iii) c ∈ V (a; b)\r
⊥ ⊂ An.\r
Now is easy to see that if {a, b, c} is a special triple then V (a; b); V (a, c); V (b, c)\r
are isomorphic to A2.\r
For a special triple {a, b, c} consider the following vector subspace of An\r
ø(a; b; c) := Span{e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c}.\r
Proposition 2.4: For a special triple {a, b, c} in An and n ≥ 3; ø(a, b, c) is\r
an eight-dimensional vector subspace isomorphic, as algebra, to A3 = ø the\r
octonions and M(A3, An) = {(a, b, c) ∈ (An)\r
3\r
|{a, b, c} special triple}.\r
Proof: We know that all elements in {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} are of norm\r
one and also\r
hc(ab), ai = −hab, aci = ha(ab), ci = ha\r
2\r
b, ci = a\r
2\r
hb, ci = 0.\r

Similarly (c(ab)) ⊥ b and (c(ab)) ⊥ c. Thus {e0, a, b, ab, c(ab), cb, ac, c} is an\r
orthonormal set of vectors and ø(a; b; c) is eight-dimensional. To see that\r
ø(a; b; c) ∼= A3 we have to construct the corresponding multiplication ta\u0002ble,which is, a routine calculation.(See [Mo2])\r
Conversely, if ϕ ∈ M(A3, An) then a = ϕ(e1), b = ϕ(e2) and c = ϕ(e7)\r
form an special triple, when {e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} is the canonical basis\r
in A3, and we recall that e1e2 = e3, e7e3 = e4, e7e2 = e5 and e1e7 = e6 in A3.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark. For n = 3, A3 is an alternative algebra so a special triple in A3 is\r
every triple such that\r
(i) {a, b, c} is orthonormal\r
(ii) c ⊥ (ab).\r
So Proposition 4.4 gives the construction of G2 = Aut(A3) as in [Wh] and\r

G2 = Aut(A3)\r
