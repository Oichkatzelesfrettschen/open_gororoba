THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS\r
SILVIO REGGIANI\r
Abstract. The sedenion algebra S is a non-commutative, non-associative, 16-dimen\u0002sional real algebra with zero divisors. It is obtained from the octonions through the\r
Cayley-Dickson construction. The zero divisors of S can be viewed as the submanifold\r
Z(S) ⊂ S × S of normalized pairs whose product equals zero, or as the submanifold\r
ZD(S) ⊂ S of normalized elements with non-trivial annihilators. We prove that Z(S)\r
is isometric to the excepcional Lie group G2, equipped with a naturally reductive left\u0002invariant metric. Moreover, Z(S) is the total space of a Riemannian submersion over\r
the excepcional symmetric space of quaternion subalgebras of the octonion algebra, with\r
fibers that are locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres with different radii.\r
Additionally, we prove that ZD(S) is isometric to the Stiefel manifold V2(R\r
7\r
), the space\r
of orthonormal 2-frames in R\r
7\r
, endowed with a specific G2-invariant metric. By shrink\u0002ing this metric along a circle fibration, we construct new examples of an Einstein metric\r
and a family of homogenous metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
) with non-negative sectional curvature.\r
1. Introduction\r
The Cayley-Dickson algebras form a sequence of real algebras An, defined recursively\r
beginning with R and doubling in dimension with each iteration. The first members\r
of this family are the familiar real division algebras: R = A0, C = A1, H = A2 and\r
O = A3. The next algebra in this sequence is the so-called sedenion algebra S = A4,\r
which is often overlooked in comparison to its lower-dimensional relatives due to its lack\r
of certain desirable algebraic properties. Nonetheless, this somewhat enigmatic algebra\r
has long intrigued mathematicians and has recently found applications in fields such as\r
theoretical physics [GG19] and machine learning [SA20].\r
Since S is not a division algebra, it is interesting to understand the structure of its zero\r
divisors. The topology of the sedenion zero divisors is described by the principal bundle\r
SU(2) → G2 → V2(R\r
7\r
),\r
where G2 is the excepcional compact Lie group of rank 2 and V2(R\r
7\r
) is the Stiefel mani\u0002fold of orthonormal 2-frames in R\r
7\r
. Specifically, G2 is homeomorphic to the submanifold\r
Z(S) ⊂ S × S of normalized sedenion pairs that multiply to zero; V2(R\r
7\r
) is homeomor\u0002phic to the submanifold ZD(S) ⊂ S of sedenions with norm √\r
2 that have non-trivial\r
annihilators; and, for each u ∈ ZD(S), the fiber SU(2) corresponds to the sphere of the\r
annihilator subspace of u (see [Mor98, BDI08]). However, little is known regarding the\r
geometry of the sedenion zero divisors.\r
Both Z(S) and ZD(S) carry a natural geometry as submanifolds of R\r
32 and R16, re\u0002spectively. Furthermore, since the zero divisors of S are invariant under Aut(S), whose\r

connected component is isomorphic to G2, it follows that Z(S) and ZD(S) are homoge\u0002neous submanifolds. In this article, we study the intrinsic geometry of the zero divisors\r
of S. First, we prove that Z(S) is isometric to G2 with a naturally reductive left-invariant\r
metric, forming the total space of a Riemannian submersion over the exceptional sym\u0002metric space G2/SO(4), with fibers locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres\r
with different radii.\r
Next, we analyze the geometry of ZD(S), which is isometric to V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2)\r
with a particular G2-invariant metric. At first glance, the geometry of ZD(S) does not\r
seem very interesting; however, by shrinking the metric along a certain circle fibration,\r
we obtain a family gr (r > 0) of G2-invariant metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
), where g 2\r
3\r
represents\r
the original metric. This process reveals several distinguished examples. Specifically, we\r
prove, among other things, that (V2(R\r
7\r
), gr):\r
• has positive scalar curvature if and only of r < 20\r
3\r
;\r
• is an Einstein manifold if and only if r =\r
5\r
9\r
;\r
• has non-negative sectional curvature if and only if 0 < r ≤\r
4\r
9\r
.\r
These results are quite remarkable, as Einstein metrics and metrics with non-negative\r
curvature are very rare. To the best of our knowledge, the examples presented in this\r
article are new. The known homogeneous Einstein metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2) =\r
SO(7)/SO(5) are limited to the unique SO(7)-invariant Einstein metric discovered by\r
Sagle and the so-called Jensen metrics (see [Sag70, Jen73, BH87, Ker98]). It is worth\r
noticing that the metric g 5\r
9\r
is neither SO(7)-invariant nor a Jensen metric. Regarding\r
metrics with non-negative sectional curvature, we refer to the survey [Zil07]. Typically,\r
examples of homogeneous metrics with non-negative curvature appear as normal homo\u0002geneous metrics or are constructed through a Cheeger deformation of a metric already\r
known to have non-negative curvature. Recall that none of the metrics gr is normal ho\u0002mogeneous (nor even naturally reductive) and that the initial metric g 2\r
3\r
does not possess\r
non-negative sectional curvature.\r
Let us comment briefly on the proof our main results. In order to study the geometry\r
of Z(S), it is necessary to “fix an origin” so that the metric can be identified with a\r
left-invariant metric on G2. Any choice of such an origin for Z(S) leads to isometric\r
metrics on G2, but a well-chosen origin can greatly simplify computations. We select the\r
origin from among the so-called 84 standard zero divisors of S. Then, using the results\r
in [DZ79], we show that Z(S) is a naturally reductive space. A similar approach applies\r
to the study of ZD(S) with the metric gr. Here, we select another standard zero divisor\r
(different from the previous one) so that the isotropy subgroup of G2 acts trivially on\r
the usual subalgebra H ⊂ S. This choice allows the metric gr to be expressed in diagonal\r
form with respect to the normal homogeneous metric, making it possible to derive a nice\r
expression for the Ricci tensor of gr.\r
The most challenging part is to determine the sign of the sectional curvatures of gr.\r
Since there is no manageable expression for the curvature (as there is for naturally re\u0002ductive spaces), using algebraic manipulation proves to be nearly impossible. Indeed, the\r
sectional curvature function Fr of gr can be interpreted as a homogeneous polynomial\r
of degree 4 in 22 real variables, which, for a generic r, has 285 non-trivial coefficients.\r
To show that Fr is non-negative for 0 < r ≤\r
4\r
9\r
, we reduce the problem to proving that\r
both F0 (the formal extension of Fr at r = 0) and F4\r
9\r
are non-negative. By using convex

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 3\r
optimization techniques, we are able to prove the stronger result that F0 and F4\r
9\r
are\r
polynomial sums of squares.\r
Finally we want to mention that the computations required in the proof of some of our\r
results are often cumbersome and were computer checked using the software SageMath.\r
The code used to verify our results is available at [Reg24].\r
We believe this work shows that the study of the geometry of Cayley-Dickson alge\u0002bras, particularly regarding their zero divisors, deserves further attention, as it may have\r
interesting implications in differential geometry of compact homogeneous spaces.\r

2. Preliminaries and notation\r
The main references for this section are [Mor98, BDI08] on Cayley-Dickson algebras\r
and their zero divisors, [Arv03] on the geometry of homogeneous spaces and [DZ79] on\r
naturally reductive left-invariant metrics on compact Lie groups. Observe that in this\r
section, as well as throughout the rest of the article, we start counting indices from 0.\r
2.1. Cayley-Dickson algebras. The Cayley-Dickson algebras An are a family of real\r
algebras, equipped with an involution a 7→ a\r
∗\r
(also called conjugation), which are recur\u0002sively defined starting from A0 = R, where a\r
∗ = a. Each subsequent algebra is defined\r
by setting An = An−1 × An−1 as a vector space, with multiplication given by\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − d\r
∗\r
b, da + bc∗)\r
and involution defined by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a∗\r
, −b).\r
Notice that the inclusion a 7→ (a, 0) is a monomorphism of algebras from An−1 into\r
An for all n ≥ 0. It is well known that the first four algebras in the Cayley-Dickson\r
construction are the real division algebras R, C, H and O, respectively. It is also known\r
that the Cayley-Dickson algebras lose some important properties with each iteration.\r
For example, An is commutative if and only if n ≤ 1, associative if and only if n ≤ 2;\r
alterative (i.e., x(xy) = (xx)y and (xy)y = x(yy) for all x, y ∈ An) if and only of n ≤ 3.\r
On the other hand, every Cayley-Dickson algebra is flexible (i.e., x(yx) = (xy)x for all\r
x, y ∈ An) and power associative (i.e., x\r
k\r
is well defined for all x ∈ An and k ∈ N).\r
For x ∈ An we define its real and imaginary parts as Re x =\r
1\r
2\r
(x + x\r
∗\r
) and Im x =\r
1\r
2\r
(x−x\r
∗\r
), respectively. We say that x is real (resp. imaginary) if Im x = 0 (resp. Re x = 0).\r
Thus, one can recover the usual inner product on An ≃ R\r
2\r
n\r
by\r
hx, yi = Re(xy∗).\r
In An, one has that kxk\r
2 = xx∗\r
for all x. However, the identity kxyk = kxkkyk does not\r
hold in general if n ≥ 4. Recall that An is a division algebra if and only n ≤ 3. If n ≥ 4,\r
then An has zero divisors. Since, xy = 0 implies yx = 0, the left and right zero divisors\r
of An coincide. Thus, an element 0 6= u ∈ An is a zero divisor if and only if ann u 6= 0,\r
where ann u is the kernel of the R-linear map Lu : An → An given by Lu(x) = ux. In\r
[Mor98], it is proven that a zero divisor u must be imaginary and dim(ann u) ≡ 0 mod 4.

4 SILVIO REGGIANI\r
Furthermore, in [BDI08] it is proven that dim ann u ≤ 2\r
n − 4n + 4. One can study the\r
zero divisors globally by defining the sets\r
Z(An) = {(u, v) ∈ An × An : kuk = kvk =\r
√\r
2 and uv = 0},\r
ZD(An) = {u ∈ An : (u, v) ∈ Z(An) for some v ∈ An}.\r
Normalizing the zero divisors to √2 is not particularly important, but it will be convenient\r
later. When n ≥ 5, the sets ZDk(An) = {u ∈ ZD(An) : dim(ann u) = k} are also of\r
interest.\r
For n ≥ 4, one has that the automorphism group of An is given by\r
Aut(An) ≃ Aut(An−1) × S3 ≃ G2 × (S3)\r
n−3\r
,\r
where S3 is the symmetric group in three elements, and G2 = Aut(O) is the 14-dimen\u0002sional compact simple Lie group of rank 2. Recall that G2 acts diagonally on An. It\r
follows that Der(An) = g2 for all n ≥ 4, where g2 is the Lie algebra of G2.\r
2.2. Sedenion zero divisors. From now on we denote the sedenion algebra A4 by S.\r
Let us denote by e0, . . . , e15 the canonical basis of S. By making an abuse of notation, we\r
also denote by e0, . . . , e3 and e0, . . . , e7 the canonical basis of H and O respectively. The\r
zero divisors of S have the following form.\r
Proposition 2.1 (See [BDI08]). An element (a, b) ∈ S is a zero divisor if and only if\r
a, b are imaginary elements of O such that kak = kbk 6= 0 and a ⊥ b.\r
From this result, one can construct the 84 standard zero divisors of S. Namely, the\r
elements of the form (ei + ej, ek ± el) ∈ Z(S) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, 9 ≤ j ≤ 15, i < k ≤ 7\r
and 9 ≤ l ≤ 15 (see Table 1). Clearly, every automorphism of S maps Z(S) into itself.\r
Moreover, we have that the connected component of Aut(S) acts simply and transitively\r
on Z(S):\r
Theorem 2.2 ([Mor98]). Z(S) is homeomorphic (and moreover, diffeomorphic) to G2.\r
Given (u0, v0) ∈ Z(S), we have that G2 · u0 = ZD(S). It is not difficult to see that the\r
isotropy subgroup at u0 is isomorphic to SU(2). Note that G2/SU(2) is diffeomorphic to\r
the Stiefel manifold V2(R\r
7\r
). In fact, every automorphism of O is completely determined\r
by its values a, b, c at e1, e2, e4 respectively. Here (a, b, c) can be any triple of pairwise\r
orthonormal imaginary octonions of norm 1 such that ab ⊥ c. Hence the map (a, b, c) 7→\r
(a, b) identifies with a transitive action of G2 in V2(R\r
7\r
), whose isotropy subgroup at (e1, e2)\r
are the octonion automorphism that act trivially on H, and therefore are isomorphic to\r
SU(2). Thus, the topology of the sedenion zero divisors is encoded by the principal bundle\r
SU(2) → G2 → V2(R\r
7\r
).\r
2.3. The Lie algebra of G2. We think of the Lie group G2 = Aut(O) as a subgroup of\r
SO(8) in the natural way (since every automorphism of O fixes e0, we have that G2 is\r
actually a subgroup of SO(7), but we do not use this identification here). So, we have g2\r
as a subalgebra of so(8). Let us consider the bi-invariant metric gbi induced by the inner\r
product on g2, which we denote with the same symbol, given by\r
gbi(X, Y ) = − tr(XY ).

Let us denote by Eij ∈ so(8), where 0 ≤ i < j ≤ 7, the matrix such that (Eij )ij =\r
−(Eij )ji = −1 and (Eij )kl = 0 in any other case. We define\r

One can see that X0, . . . , X13 is an orthonormal basis of g2 with respect to the bi\u0002invariant metric. We will denote by X0\r

We have that k0 and m0 are two subalgebras of g2 isomorphic to so(3) such that\r
[k0, m0] = 0. Moreover, k0 ⊕ m0 ≃ so(4) is the subalgebra of a maximal subgroup of G2\r
isomorphic to SO(4) (cfr. [BLS20]). Such subgroup preserves the orthogonal decomposi\u0002tion O = H ⊕ H⊥. Furthermore, the subgroup of G2 with Lie algebra k0 is isomorphic\r
to SU(2) and acts trivially on H. Recall that G2/SO(4), with the normal homogeneous\r
metric, is the symmetric space of quaternion subalgebras of O.\r
2.4. Homogeneous and naturally reductive spaces. Let G be a Lie group and H\r
be a compact subgroup of G. Let us denote by g and h the Lie algebras of G and H,\r
respectively. Assume that G acts almost effectively on M = G/H and that M is endowed\r
with a G-invariant metric g. Recall that every X ∈ g induces a Killing vector field X∗\r
on M defined as X∗\r

, Y ∗].\r
Let us fix a reductive decomposition g = h⊕m (i.e., m is an Ad(H)-invariant subspace\r
of g complementary to h), which always exists since H is compact. Assume that H is\r
the isotropy subgroup of p ∈ M. Then we can identify m ≃ TpM. The geometry of M\r
is determined by an Ad(H)-invariant inner product on m, which we also denote by g,\r
defined such that the map X ∈ m 7→ X∗\r
p ∈ TpM is a linear isometry. With this setting,\r
we can compute the Levi-Civita connection of M as\r

[X, Y ]m + U(X, Y ), X, Y ∈ m, (2.1)\r
where U is the algebraic tensor on m given by\r

, Xi).\r
Recall that the metric g on M = G/H is naturally reductive if and only if U ≡ 0.\r
An interesting particular case is when a left-invariant metric on a Lie group is naturally\r
reductive (with respect to a certain transitive Lie group of isometries).\r
Theorem 2.3 ([DZ79]). Let G be a compact, simple Lie group group endowed with a\r
left-invariant metric g. Let g denote the Lie algebra of G and let gbi be a bi-invariant\r
metric on G (which is a negative multiple of the Killing form of g). The metric g is\r
naturally reductive if and only if there exists a subalgebra k of g such that\r
g = gk0 ⊕ α1 gbi|k1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ αr gbi|kr ⊕ α gbi|k⊥\r
where k = k0 ⊕ k1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ kr, with k0 the center of k and k1, . . . ,kr are simple ideals. Here,\r
k\r
⊥ is the orthogonal complement of k with respect to the bi-invariant metric, gk0\r
is an\r
arbitrary inner product on k0, and α1, . . . , αr, α are positive real numbers.\r
3. The G2-invariant metrics on Z(S) and ZD(S)\r
Consider Z(S) as a submanifold of S × S ≃ R\r
32 with the induced metric. Although\r
this reduction is not necessary here, one could lower the codimension of Z(S). In fact,\r
by Proposition 2.1, Z(S) is a submanifold of S\r
6 × S6 × S6 × S6\r
. Since G2 = Aut(O) ⊂\r
Aut(S) acts isometrically on S × S, we have that Z(S) is a homogeneous submanifold.\r
Furthermore, by Theorem 2.2, the diffeomorphism Z(S) ≃ G2 induces a left-invariant\r
metric g on G2.\r
Theorem 3.1. The metric on Z(S) is naturally reductive. Furthermore, Z(S) is the\r
total space of a Riemannian submersion over the excepcional symmetric space G2/SO(4)\r
with totally geodesic fibers, which are locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres\r
with different radii.\r
Proof. It is sufficient to prove the theorem for the left-invariant metric on G2 defined in\r
the paragraph preceding the statement. To determine such a metric, one fixes an element\r
(u0, v0) ∈ Z(S) and computes\r
g(Xi, Xj ) = (Xi· (u0, v0))T(Xj· (u0, v0)). (3.1)\r
Note that not every zero divisor pair behaves nicely with respect to the decomposition\r
g2 = k0 ⊕ m0 ⊕ m1 ⊕ m2 given in Subsection 2.3. By running (3.1) over the standard zero

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 7\r
divisors from Table 1, we observe that if (u0, v0) = (e4 + e13, e6 + e15) the metric can be\r
expressed as\r
g =\r

i=0\r

i ⊗ Xi = gbi|k0 ⊕\r
1\r
3\r
gbi|m0 ⊕\r
1\r
2\r
gbi|m1⊕m2.\r
From Theorem 2.3, it follows that this metric is naturally reductive. More precisely, this\r
metric is naturally reductive with respect to G2 ×SO(4), where the second factor acts on\r
the right and the isotropy subgroup is given by diag(SO(4) × SO(4)). Thus, from [DZ79,\r
Theorem 8], the subgroup SO(4) ⊂ G2, whose Lie algebra is given by k0 ⊕ m0, is totally\r
geodesic.\r
Since g|m1⊕m2is a multiple of the bi-invariant metric, when restricted to m1 ⊕ m2, and\r
k0 ⊕ m0 ≃ so(4) is orthogonal to m1 ⊕ m2 with respect to both metrics, we conclude\r
that (G2, g) → G2/SO(4) is a Riemannian submersion. The fiber of this submersion is\r
isometric to the Lie group SO(4) endowed with the bi-invariant metric g|k0⊕m0, which is\r
obtained by taking two different scalings of the bi-invariant metric on the simple ideals\r
so(3) ≃ k0 ≃ m0 of so(4). Hence, the universal cover of SO(4) splits into a product of\r
two round spheres with different radii. \u0003\r
Remark 3.2. Since the metric in Z(S) is naturally reductive, many geometric properties\r
follow from existing results. For example, the (connected component of the) full isometry\r
group is computed in [DZ79] (see also [OR13]). The so-called index of symmetry of Z(S),\r
which in this case is trivial, can be computed from the results in [ORT14]. It can also\r
be seen from [DZ79] that the metric on Z(S) is not Einstein. We verify this fact again\r
in the next proposition by explicitly computing the Ricci tensor, which also allows us to\r
show that the Ricci curvature is positive.\r
Proposition 3.3. Z(S) has positive Ricci curvature. Moreover,\r

Proof. It follows from a straightforward computation using the following well-known for\u0002mula. Let Y0, . . . , Y13 be an g-orthonormal basis of g2. Then\r

choose Yi = g(Xi, Xi)\r

Now we direct our attention to the geometry of ZD(S) with the metric induced from the\r
ambient space S ≃ R\r
16. Since G2 acts isometrically and transitively on ZD(S), we have\r
that ZD(S) is isometric to the Stiefel manifold G2 · u0 = G2/SU(2) = V2(R\r
7\r
), equipped\r
with a certain G2-invariant metric, where SU(2) is the isotropy subgroup of u0 ∈ ZD(S).\r
We again denote by g such a metric, which is defined by\r
g(Xi, Xj ) = (Xi· u0)\r
T\r
(Xj· u0).

8 SILVIO REGGIANI\r
Similarly to the case of Z(S), we can choose u0 appropriately so that the Lie algebra\r
of SU(2) is k0. Taking u0 = e1 + e10, we obtain that\r
g2 = k0 ⊕ m, where m = m0 ⊕ m1 ⊕ m2,\r
is a reductive decomposition for G2/SU(2). The corresponding Ad(SU(2))-invariant inner\r
product on m is given by\r

A detailed study of the isometry group and the curvature of g is given in the next\r
section. Before proceeding, we note a simple fact about the sectional curvatures of g.\r
Remark 3.4. Let us denote by πij the 2-dimensional subspace of m generated by Xi and\r
Xj, where 3 ≤ i < j ≤ 13. Then the sectional curvature of πij is non-negative if and\r
only if πij 6= π34. This suggests that one could attempt to modify the metric g along\r
the direction normal to π34 inside m1 in order to get some examples of metrics with\r
non-negative sectional curvature. We explore this approach in the next section.\r
4. A family of G2-invariant metrics on V2(R\r
7\r

For each r > 0, we consider on V2(R\r
7\r
) the family of G2-invariant metrics given by\r
gr =\r

(X\r

. (4.1)\r
Indeed, gr gives an Ad(SU(2))-invariant inner product on m since m0 is the subspace\r
of fixed points of the isotropy representation of G2/SU(2) and\r
gr|m1 =\r
1\r
2\r
gbi|m1, gr|m2 =\r
1\r
6\r
gbi|m2.\r
Next, we compute the connected component of the full isometry group of gr.\r
Theorem 4.1. I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gr) ≃ G2 × S\r
1\r
.\r
Proof. Since G2 is a compact simple Lie group, it follows from the results in [Oni92] that\r
I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gr) ⊂ I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gnh), where gnh = gbi|m is the normal homogeneous metric\r
associated with the homogeneous presentation V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2). From [Reg10], we\r
have that I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gnh) ≃ G2 × K (almost direct product) where the Lie algebra of\r
K is given by the G2-invariant vector fields, which are identified with the fixed vectors\r
of the isotropy representation. That is, the Lie algebra of K is identified with m0, but\r
the elements of K ≃ SU(2) act “on the right”. Then, it is not difficult to see that\r
I0(V2(R\r
7\r
)) ≃ G2 × K′(almost direct product) for a compact and connected subgroup K′\r
of K, which in principle depends on r. Since dim K = 3, it is enough to see that K′ 6= K\r
and dim K′ ≥ 1.\r
Now, for Y ∈ m0, let Yˆ be the G2-invariant vector field induced by Y . Using (2.1)\r
and the fact that ∇X∗ Yˆ = ∇Yˆ X∗\r
for all X ∈ m, one can see that Yˆ is a Killing field\r
for gr if and only if [Y, −]m : m → m is skew-symmetric with respect to gr. The 1\r
2\r
- and\r
1\r
6\r
-scalings of the metric on the irreducible subspaces m1 and m2 prevent Xˆ\r
3 and Xˆ4 from\r
being Killing fields for gr. However, one can check that Xˆ\r
5 is a Killing field for gr for any\r
r > 0. Thus K′ = S\r
1\r
, which implies I0(V2(R\r
7\r
)) = G2 × S\r
1\r
is actually a direct product.\r
Observe that we have proved that the S\r
1\r
factor is independent of r. \u0003

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 9\r
Now, we compute the Ricci and scalar curvature of gr. In particular, we obtain the\r
following result.\r
Theorem 4.2. (1) The metric gr is Einstein if and only if r =\r
5\r
9\r
.\r
(2) The metric gr has positive scalar curvature if and only if r < 20\r
3\r
.\r
Proof. Let Y3, . . . , Y13 be the gr-orthonormal basis of m obtained from normalizing the\r
basis X3, . . . , X13. We can use formula (2.2) to explicitly compute the Ricci tensor Ricgr\r
of gr. After lengthy computations, carefully verified using a computer (see [Reg24]), we\r
obtain\r
Ricgr =\r

. (4.2)\r
Hence, gr is Einstein if and only if r =\r
5\r
9\r
. Also, from (4.2) we get that the scalar\r
curvature scalgr = 50 −\r
15\r
2\r
r is positive if and only if r < 20\r
3\r
. \u0003\r
Remark 4.3. In [Jen73], the construction of remarkable examples of Einstein metrics on\r
the base space of certain principal bundles can be found. Such metrics are now known\r
as Jensen metrics. In particular, there exist G2-invariant Einstein metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
),\r
arising from the principal bundle SU(2) → G2 → G2/SU(2), which in our notation takes\r
the form t\r
2\r
gbi|m0 ⊕ gbi|m1⊕m2for certain values of t > 0. Notice that the metric g 5\r
9\r
from\r
Theorem 4.2 is not a Jensen metric. Moreover, it is not even bi-invariant when restricted\r
to m0.\r
Theorem 4.4. The metric gr has non-negative sectional curvature if and only if r ≤\r
4\r
9\r
.\r
In order to prove our theorem, we will need the following result, which is a particular\r
case of Theorem 1 in [PW98] (see also [CLR95]).\r
Lemma 4.5. Let F ∈ R[x0, . . . , xn] be a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4. Then F is\r
a (polynomial) sum of squares if and only if there exists a symmetric positive semi-definite\r
matrix H such that\r
F = x\r
T Hx (4.3)\r
where x = (x\r
2\r
0\r
, x0x1, . . . , xn−1xn, x2\r
n\r
)\r
T\r
is the vector of monomials of degree 2.\r
Let us mention that the vector x has (n+2)(n+1)\r
2\r
coordinates and the subspace of, not\r
necessarily positive semi-definite, matrices H satisfying (4.3) has dimension (n+2)(n+1)2n\r
12 .\r
Thus, finding an exact (positive semi-definite) solution H for equation (4.3) can be quite\r
difficult, even for relatively small values of n.\r
Proof of Theorem 4.4. It is not hard to see that if π34 = RX3 ⊕ RX4, then the sectional\r
curvature of the plane π34 is\r
κgr\r
(π34) = −\r
9\r
4\r
r + 1.\r
Thus, gr does not have non-negative sectional curvature for r > 4\r
9\r
. Let Y3, . . . , Y13 be\r
the orthonormal basis of m defined in the proof of Theorem 4.2 and write\r
X =\r
X\r
13\r
i=3\r
xi−3Yi, Y =\r
X\r

For each r, consider the polynomial\r
Fr = gr(R\r
gr\r
X,Y X, Y ) ∈ R[x0, . . . , x21],

10 SILVIO REGGIANI\r
where Rgr denotes the curvature tensor of gr. Observe that we can formally extend the\r
polynomial Fr to every r ∈ R (even when gr does not make sense for r ≤ 0). Moreover,\r
from the explicit formula for Fr, which can be found in the Appendix A.2, we see that\r
fixing x0, . . . , x21, the map r 7→ Fr(x0, . . . , x21) defines a linear function on r. Thus, it is\r
enough to prove that the polynomials F0 and F4\r
9\r
are non-negative. We will use Lemma 4.5\r
to prove the stronger statement that F0 and F4\r
9\r
are polynomial sums of squares. Since\r
Fr is obtained from computing sectional curvatures, every monomial xixjxkxl with non\u0002trivial coefficient in Fr satisfies 0 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ 10 < k ≤ l ≤ 21. Hence, we do not lose\r
generality replacing x\r
T\r
in Lemma 4.5 with\r
x\r
T = (x0x11, . . . , x0x21, . . . , x10x11, . . . , x10x21, x2\r
0\r
, . . . , x2\r
21).\r
This change substantially reduces the size of the system (4.3) from 253×253 to 143×143.\r
Now we are looking for symmetric positive semi-definite matrices Hα such that\r
Fα = x\r
T Hαx, α ∈ {0,\r
4\r
9\r
}.\r
This is a convex optimization problem, which, thanks to the reduction of the dimen\u0002sion mentioned above, can be successfully solved by the Python solver CVXOPT. We\r
implemented the computer code in SageMath through two instances of SemidefinitePro\u0002gram(). However, this only yields numerical solutions, and since the condition of being\r
positive semi-definite is a closed one, an exact solution is not guaranteed. Nonetheless,\r
since the polynomial sums of squares are dense in the set of non-negative polynomials,\r
exact solutions are expected to exist. Moreover, since Fr has relatively few non-trivial\r
coefficients, one can expect to find sparse solutions H0 and H4\r
9\r
. This is indeed the case,\r
since rounding the numerical solutions lead us to the exact solution described as follows.\r

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 13\r
defines a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix satisfying F4\r
9\r
= x\r
T H4\r
9\r
x. This concludes\r
the proof of the theorem. \u0003\r
Remark 4.6. We are not certain if Fr is a polynomial sum of squares for 0 < r < 4\r
9\r
.\r
Although it is not needed in the proof of Theorem 4.4, it would be interesting to know if\r
this is indeed the case.\r
Remark 4.7. The definition (4.1) of the metric gr resembles the construction of Berger\r
spheres from the Hopf fibration by shrinking the metrics along the fibers. Moreover, if\r
we restrict gr to m0 ≃ su(2), then S\r
3\r
r = (SU(2), gr|m0\r
) is a Berger sphere. Recall that S\r
3\r
r\r
has (strictly) positive sectional curvature if and only if 0 < r < 4\r
9\r
.\r

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS\r
SILVIO REGGIANI\r
Abstract. The sedenion algebra S is a non-commutative, non-associative, 16-dimen\u0002sional real algebra with zero divisors. It is obtained from the octonions through the\r
Cayley-Dickson construction. The zero divisors of S can be viewed as the submanifold\r
Z(S) ⊂ S × S of normalized pairs whose product equals zero, or as the submanifold\r
ZD(S) ⊂ S of normalized elements with non-trivial annihilators. We prove that Z(S)\r
is isometric to the excepcional Lie group G2, equipped with a naturally reductive left\u0002invariant metric. Moreover, Z(S) is the total space of a Riemannian submersion over\r
the excepcional symmetric space of quaternion subalgebras of the octonion algebra, with\r
fibers that are locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres with different radii.\r
Additionally, we prove that ZD(S) is isometric to the Stiefel manifold V2(R\r
7\r
), the space\r
of orthonormal 2-frames in R\r
7\r
, endowed with a specific G2-invariant metric. By shrink\u0002ing this metric along a circle fibration, we construct new examples of an Einstein metric\r
and a family of homogenous metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
) with non-negative sectional curvature."""

The Cayley-Dickson algebras form a sequence of real algebras An, defined recursively\r
beginning with R and doubling in dimension with each iteration. The first members\r
of this family are the familiar real division algebras: R = A0, C = A1, H = A2 and\r
O = A3. The next algebra in this sequence is the so-called sedenion algebra S = A4,\r
which is often overlooked in comparison to its lower-dimensional relatives due to its lack\r
of certain desirable algebraic properties. Nonetheless, this somewhat enigmatic algebra\r
has long intrigued mathematicians and has recently found applications in fields such as\r
theoretical physics [GG19] and machine learning [SA20].\r
Since S is not a division algebra, it is interesting to understand the structure of its zero\r
divisors. The topology of the sedenion zero divisors is described by the principal bundle\r
SU(2) → G2 → V2(R\r

connected component is isomorphic to G2, it follows that Z(S) and ZD(S) are homoge\u0002neous submanifolds. In this article, we study the intrinsic geometry of the zero divisors\r
of S. First, we prove that Z(S) is isometric to G2 with a naturally reductive left-invariant\r
metric, forming the total space of a Riemannian submersion over the exceptional sym\u0002metric space G2/SO(4), with fibers locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres\r
with different radii.\r
Next, we analyze the geometry of ZD(S), which is isometric to V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2)\r
with a particular G2-invariant metric. At first glance, the geometry of ZD(S) does not\r
seem very interesting; however, by shrinking the metric along a certain circle fibration,\r
we obtain a family gr (r > 0) of G2-invariant metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
), where g 2\r
3\r
represents\r
the original metric. This process reveals several distinguished examples. Specifically, we\r
prove, among other things, that (V2(R\r
7\r
), gr):\r
• has positive scalar curvature if and only of r < 20\r
3\r
;\r
• is an Einstein manifold if and only if r =\r
5\r
9\r
;\r
• has non-negative sectional curvature if and only if 0 < r ≤\r
4\r
9\r
.\r
These results are quite remarkable, as Einstein metrics and metrics with non-negative\r
curvature are very rare. To the best of our knowledge, the examples presented in this\r
article are new. The known homogeneous Einstein metrics on V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2) =\r
SO(7)/SO(5) are limited to the unique SO(7)-invariant Einstein metric discovered by\r
Sagle and the so-called Jensen metrics (see [Sag70, Jen73, BH87, Ker98]). It is worth\r
noticing that the metric g 5\r
9\r
is neither SO(7)-invariant nor a Jensen metric. Regarding\r
metrics with non-negative sectional curvature, we refer to the survey [Zil07]. Typically,\r
examples of homogeneous metrics with non-negative curvature appear as normal homo\u0002geneous metrics or are constructed through a Cheeger deformation of a metric already\r
known to have non-negative curvature. Recall that none of the metrics gr is normal ho\u0002mogeneous (nor even naturally reductive) and that the initial metric g 2\r
3\r
does not possess\r
non-negative sectional curvature.\r
Let us comment briefly on the proof our main results. In order to study the geometry\r
of Z(S), it is necessary to “fix an origin” so that the metric can be identified with a\r
left-invariant metric on G2. Any choice of such an origin for Z(S) leads to isometric\r
metrics on G2, but a well-chosen origin can greatly simplify computations. We select the\r
origin from among the so-called 84 standard zero divisors of S. Then, using the results\r
in [DZ79], we show that Z(S) is a naturally reductive space. A similar approach applies\r
to the study of ZD(S) with the metric gr. Here, we select another standard zero divisor\r
(different from the previous one) so that the isotropy subgroup of G2 acts trivially on\r
the usual subalgebra H ⊂ S. This choice allows the metric gr to be expressed in diagonal\r
form with respect to the normal homogeneous metric, making it possible to derive a nice\r
expression for the Ricci tensor of gr.\r
The most challenging part is to determine the sign of the sectional curvatures of gr.\r
Since there is no manageable expression for the curvature (as there is for naturally re\u0002ductive spaces), using algebraic manipulation proves to be nearly impossible. Indeed, the\r
sectional curvature function Fr of gr can be interpreted as a homogeneous polynomial\r
of degree 4 in 22 real variables, which, for a generic r, has 285 non-trivial coefficients.\r
To show that Fr is non-negative for 0 < r ≤\r
4\r
9\r
, we reduce the problem to proving that\r
both F0 (the formal extension of Fr at r = 0) and F4\r
9\r
are non-negative. By using convex

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 3\r
optimization techniques, we are able to prove the stronger result that F0 and F4\r
9\r
are\r
polynomial sums of squares.\r
Finally we want to mention that the computations required in the proof of some of our\r
results are often cumbersome and were computer checked using the software SageMath.\r
The code used to verify our results is available at [Reg24].\r
We believe this work shows that the study of the geometry of Cayley-Dickson alge\u0002bras, particularly regarding their zero divisors, deserves further attention, as it may have\r
interesting implications in differential geometry of compact homogeneous spaces.\r

algebras, equipped with an involution a 7→ a\r
∗\r
(also called conjugation), which are recur\u0002sively defined starting from A0 = R, where a\r
∗ = a. Each subsequent algebra is defined\r
by setting An = An−1 × An−1 as a vector space, with multiplication given by\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − d\r
∗\r
b, da + bc∗)\r
and involution defined by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a∗\r
, −b).\r
Notice that the inclusion a 7→ (a, 0) is a monomorphism of algebras from An−1 into\r
An for all n ≥ 0. It is well known that the first four algebras in the Cayley-Dickson\r
construction are the real division algebras R, C, H and O, respectively. It is also known\r
that the Cayley-Dickson algebras lose some important properties with each iteration.\r
For example, An is commutative if and only if n ≤ 1, associative if and only if n ≤ 2;\r
alterative (i.e., x(xy) = (xx)y and (xy)y = x(yy) for all x, y ∈ An) if and only of n ≤ 3.\r
On the other hand, every Cayley-Dickson algebra is flexible (i.e., x(yx) = (xy)x for all\r
x, y ∈ An) and power associative (i.e., x\r
k\r
is well defined for all x ∈ An and k ∈ N).\r
For x ∈ An we define its real and imaginary parts as Re x =\r
1\r
2\r
(x + x\r
∗\r
) and Im x =\r
1\r
2\r
(x−x\r
∗\r
), respectively. We say that x is real (resp. imaginary) if Im x = 0 (resp. Re x = 0).\r
Thus, one can recover the usual inner product on An ≃ R\r
2\r
n\r
by\r
hx, yi = Re(xy∗).\r
In An, one has that kxk\r
2 = xx∗\r
for all x. However, the identity kxyk = kxkkyk does not\r
hold in general if n ≥ 4. Recall that An is a division algebra if and only n ≤ 3. If n ≥ 4,\r
then An has zero divisors. Since, xy = 0 implies yx = 0, the left and right zero divisors\r
of An coincide. Thus, an element 0 6= u ∈ An is a zero divisor if and only if ann u 6= 0,\r
where ann u is the kernel of the R-linear map Lu : An → An given by Lu(x) = ux. In\r
[Mor98], it is proven that a zero divisor u must be imaginary and dim(ann u) ≡ 0 mod 4."""

Furthermore, in [BDI08] it is proven that dim ann u ≤ 2\r
n − 4n + 4. One can study the\r
zero divisors globally by defining the sets\r
Z(An) = {(u, v) ∈ An × An : kuk = kvk =\r
√\r
2 and uv = 0},\r
ZD(An) = {u ∈ An : (u, v) ∈ Z(An) for some v ∈ An}.\r
Normalizing the zero divisors to √2 is not particularly important, but it will be convenient\r
later. When n ≥ 5, the sets ZDk(An) = {u ∈ ZD(An) : dim(ann u) = k} are also of\r
interest.\r
For n ≥ 4, one has that the automorphism group of An is given by\r
Aut(An) ≃ Aut(An−1) × S3 ≃ G2 × (S3)\r
n−3\r
,\r
where S3 is the symmetric group in three elements, and G2 = Aut(O) is the 14-dimen\u0002sional compact simple Lie group of rank 2. Recall that G2 acts diagonally on An. It\r
follows that Der(An) = g2 for all n ≥ 4, where g2 is the Lie algebra of G2."""

Let us denote by e0, . . . , e15 the canonical basis of S. By making an abuse of notation, we\r
also denote by e0, . . . , e3 and e0, . . . , e7 the canonical basis of H and O respectively. The\r
zero divisors of S have the following form.\r
Proposition 2.1 (See [BDI08]). An element (a, b) ∈ S is a zero divisor if and only if\r
a, b are imaginary elements of O such that kak = kbk 6= 0 and a ⊥ b.\r
From this result, one can construct the 84 standard zero divisors of S. Namely, the\r
elements of the form (ei + ej, ek ± el) ∈ Z(S) such that 1 ≤ i ≤ 6, 9 ≤ j ≤ 15, i < k ≤ 7\r
and 9 ≤ l ≤ 15 (see Table 1). Clearly, every automorphism of S maps Z(S) into itself.\r
Moreover, we have that the connected component of Aut(S) acts simply and transitively\r
on Z(S):\r
Theorem 2.2 ([Mor98]). Z(S) is homeomorphic (and moreover, diffeomorphic) to G2.\r
Given (u0, v0) ∈ Z(S), we have that G2 · u0 = ZD(S). It is not difficult to see that the\r
isotropy subgroup at u0 is isomorphic to SU(2). Note that G2/SU(2) is diffeomorphic to\r
the Stiefel manifold V2(R\r

Consider Z(S) as a submanifold of S × S ≃ R\r
32 with the induced metric. Although\r
this reduction is not necessary here, one could lower the codimension of Z(S). In fact,\r
by Proposition 2.1, Z(S) is a submanifold of S\r
6 × S6 × S6 × S6\r
. Since G2 = Aut(O) ⊂\r
Aut(S) acts isometrically on S × S, we have that Z(S) is a homogeneous submanifold.\r
Furthermore, by Theorem 2.2, the diffeomorphism Z(S) ≃ G2 induces a left-invariant\r
metric g on G2.\r
Theorem 3.1. The metric on Z(S) is naturally reductive. Furthermore, Z(S) is the\r
total space of a Riemannian submersion over the excepcional symmetric space G2/SO(4)\r
with totally geodesic fibers, which are locally isometric to a product of two round 3-spheres\r
with different radii.\r
Proof. It is sufficient to prove the theorem for the left-invariant metric on G2 defined in\r
the paragraph preceding the statement. To determine such a metric, one fixes an element\r
(u0, v0) ∈ Z(S) and computes\r
g(Xi, Xj ) = (Xi· (u0, v0))T(Xj· (u0, v0)). (3.1)\r
Note that not every zero divisor pair behaves nicely with respect to the decomposition\r
g2 = k0 ⊕ m0 ⊕ m1 ⊕ m2 given in Subsection 2.3. By running (3.1) over the standard zero

THE GEOMETRY OF SEDENION ZERO DIVISORS 7\r

From Theorem 2.3, it follows that this metric is naturally reductive. More precisely, this\r
metric is naturally reductive with respect to G2 ×SO(4), where the second factor acts on\r
the right and the isotropy subgroup is given by diag(SO(4) × SO(4)). Thus, from [DZ79,\r
Theorem 8], the subgroup SO(4) ⊂ G2, whose Lie algebra is given by k0 ⊕ m0, is totally\r
geodesic.\r
Since g|m1⊕m2is a multiple of the bi-invariant metric, when restricted to m1 ⊕ m2, and\r
k0 ⊕ m0 ≃ so(4) is orthogonal to m1 ⊕ m2 with respect to both metrics, we conclude\r
that (G2, g) → G2/SO(4) is a Riemannian submersion. The fiber of this submersion is\r
isometric to the Lie group SO(4) endowed with the bi-invariant metric g|k0⊕m0, which is\r
obtained by taking two different scalings of the bi-invariant metric on the simple ideals\r
so(3) ≃ k0 ≃ m0 of so(4). Hence, the universal cover of SO(4) splits into a product of\r
two round spheres with different radii. \u0003\r
Remark 3.2. Since the metric in Z(S) is naturally reductive, many geometric properties\r
follow from existing results. For example, the (connected component of the) full isometry\r
group is computed in [DZ79] (see also [OR13]). The so-called index of symmetry of Z(S),\r
which in this case is trivial, can be computed from the results in [ORT14]. It can also\r
be seen from [DZ79] that the metric on Z(S) is not Einstein. We verify this fact again\r
in the next proposition by explicitly computing the Ricci tensor, which also allows us to\r
show that the Ricci curvature is positive.\r

gbi|m1, gr|m2 =\r

Next, we compute the connected component of the full isometry group of gr.\r
Theorem 4.1. I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gr) ≃ G2 × S\r
1\r
.\r
Proof. Since G2 is a compact simple Lie group, it follows from the results in [Oni92] that\r
I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gr) ⊂ I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gnh), where gnh = gbi|m is the normal homogeneous metric\r
associated with the homogeneous presentation V2(R\r
7\r
) = G2/SU(2). From [Reg10], we\r
have that I0(V2(R\r
7\r
), gnh) ≃ G2 × K (almost direct product) where the Lie algebra of\r
K is given by the G2-invariant vector fields, which are identified with the fixed vectors\r
of the isotropy representation. That is, the Lie algebra of K is identified with m0, but\r
the elements of K ≃ SU(2) act “on the right”. Then, it is not difficult to see that\r
I0(V2(R\r
7\r
)) ≃ G2 × K′(almost direct product) for a compact and connected subgroup K′\r
of K, which in principle depends on r. Since dim K = 3, it is enough to see that K′ 6= K\r
and dim K′ ≥ 1.\r
Now, for Y ∈ m0, let Yˆ be the G2-invariant vector field induced by Y . Using (2.1)\r
and the fact that ∇X∗ Yˆ = ∇Yˆ X∗\r
for all X ∈ m, one can see that Yˆ is a Killing field\r
for gr if and only if [Y, −]m : m → m is skew-symmetric with respect to gr. The 1\r
2\r
- and\r
1\r
6\r

3 and Xˆ4 from\r
being Killing fields for gr. However, one can check that Xˆ\r

r > 0. Thus K′ = S\r

Remark 4.7. The definition (4.1) of the metric gr resembles the construction of Berger\r

we restrict gr to m0 ≃ su(2), then S\r
