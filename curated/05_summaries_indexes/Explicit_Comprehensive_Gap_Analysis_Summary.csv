Completed Steps,Remaining Explicit Actions
SIMD AVX/AVX-512 Instruction Validation,Granular AI-based Solver Optimization (Advanced Feature Engineering and Neural Networks)
OpenMP Parallelization and Optimization,Deeper LLVM IR explicit inspection vs manually vectorized kernels
Explicit Cython and Python C-API Kernel Capability Check,Compiler flags benchmarking explicitly across multiple numeric kernels
Numeric Kernel Benchmarks (SIMD vs. Non-SIMD),Full Cython-Python Integration and further advanced numeric kernel optimization
"AVX-512 Subset Profiling (BW, DQ, VL, FMA)","Extended profiling of thread scheduling strategies (guided, dynamic, static chunking explicitly)"
Robust Memory Alignment and SIMD Intrinsic Usage,Explicit profiling of larger dataset simulations (greater than 1 million elements)
Python-Cython Boundary Overhead Profiling,"Explicit analysis of other CPU instructions subsets not yet profiled (e.g., AVX512CD, AVX512ER, AVX512PF, AVX512VBMI explicitly)"
Explicit Instruction-Level Assembly Analysis,"Comprehensive comparative benchmarks explicitly between legacy and modern CPU architectures (e.g., historical Intel CPUs vs modern AVX-512 explicitly)"
