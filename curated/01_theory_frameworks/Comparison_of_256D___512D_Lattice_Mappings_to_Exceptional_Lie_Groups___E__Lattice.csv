Mathematical Framework,Observed Properties,Limitations
256D & 512D Lattice Mappings,Show deep nested hypercomplex structure,Suggests connection to higher-dimensional symmetries
E_8 Lattice,Encodes fundamental exceptional Lie structures,Requires nonassociative algebraic extensions
"Exceptional Lie Groups (E_6, E_7, E_8)",Provide geometric foundations for gauge theories,No direct known link to Cayley-Dickson algebras
