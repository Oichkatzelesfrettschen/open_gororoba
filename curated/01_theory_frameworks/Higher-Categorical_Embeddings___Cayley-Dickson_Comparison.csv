Concept,Necessary for Universal Algebra?,Cayley-Dickson Comparison (Doubling)?
infty-Categories & Higher Homotopy Categories,True,"Universal Algebra does not double, instead exhibits fractal decomposition."
Exceptional Tensor Categories,True,Tensorial growth instead of pure doubling.
Braided/Modular Higher Categories,True,More modular & braided than Cayley-Dickson exponential structure.
Topos Theory & Higher-Groupoids,True,"Unlike Cayley-Dickson, exhibits homotopy-theoretic stabilization."
Exceptional Stacks & Algebraic Cohomology,True,Leads to categorical stacking instead of geometric doubling.
