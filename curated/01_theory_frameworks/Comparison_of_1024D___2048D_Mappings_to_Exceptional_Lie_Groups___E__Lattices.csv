Mathematical Framework,Potential Applications,Challenges
1024D & 2048D Lattice Mappings,Deep nested hypercomplex structure,Possible alignment with exceptional Lie symmetries
E_8 Lattice,Encodes fundamental Lie group symmetries,Requires formal mapping of extreme-dimensional hypercomplex spaces
"Exceptional Lie Groups (E_6, E_7, E_8)",Provide symmetry structures for gauge theories,Potential link to hyperdimensional lattice formations
Quantum Gravity,Requires nonassociative embeddings,Could 2048D hypercomplex mappings serve as computational gauge models?
