# Claude Overlay for open_gororoba

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical contributor contract.

This file is a lightweight overlay for Claude-style workflows:

- Follow `AGENTS.md` precedence and directory contracts.
- Keep strict warnings-as-errors discipline.
- Use TOML-first registry updates before markdown mirror edits.
- Keep front-end app implementation under `apps/`.
