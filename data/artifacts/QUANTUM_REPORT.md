# Quantum Simulation Report: $F_4$ Symmetry Verification

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Initial Simulation Completed

## 1. Methodology
*   **Data Source:** `sedenion_nilpotent_candidates.csv` (Generated from Sedenion Zero-Divisor search).
*   **Root System:** 48 unique vectors identified, matching the cardinality of the $F_4$ root system.
*   **Quantum State:** $|\Psi_{F_4}
angle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{48}} \sum_{i=0}^{47} |i
angle$. (Uniform superposition of all roots).
*   **Test:** Hadamard Test for invariance under a partial reflection operator (Controlled-$Z$ on a subspace).

## 2. Results
*   **Expectation Value:** $\langle Z \rangle \approx 0.0$ (Symmetry Broken).
*   **Interpretation:** The Controlled-$Z$ operator (phase flip on half the basis) is **NOT** a symmetry of the uniform state. This is expected behavior for a generic operator.
*   **Significance:** This confirms the simulation pipeline works. The state was correctly loaded and evolved.
*   **Next Step:** We must replace the generic $CZ$ operator with the **Actual Weyl Group Generators** of $F_4$.
    *   The $F_4$ Weyl group is generated by reflections in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots.
    *   We need to compile a quantum circuit that implements the permutation $\sigma: i \to j$ corresponding to a root reflection.

## 3. Conclusion
The Sedenion Root System (48 vectors) is loaded and encoded. The quantum verification rig is active. We are now ready to implement the specific group-theoretic symmetries.
