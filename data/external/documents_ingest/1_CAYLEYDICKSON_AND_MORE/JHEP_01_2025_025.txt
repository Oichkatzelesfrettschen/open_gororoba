Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent
from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary
differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for
continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement
entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to
holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor
models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our
algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally,
we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional
systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding
chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the
metallic property of these models.

Introduction

Entanglement, a fundamental characteristic of quantum mechanics, elucidates the intriguing
non-local correlations between quantum entities, and is at the core of quantum information
sciences [1–3]. Especially, the notion of entanglement entropy now exerts a wide-ranging
influence, spanning from condensed matter [4] to high-energy quantum field theory [5] and
even extending into quantum gravity [6].
Within condensed matter physics, for example, entanglement entropy proves its versatility
as a tool, facilitating the characterization of quantum phases and the intricate dynamics
of strongly correlated many-body systems [7, 8]. The scaling behavior of entanglement
entropy [9] offers insights into phases beyond symmetry characterization, particularly useful
for identifying exotic states like topological phases [10–12] and spin liquids [13, 14]. Additionally, entanglement entropy aids in exploring quantum criticality [15], understanding
non-equilibrium dynamics [16, 17], and assessing numerical techniques for efficient many-body
physics simulation [18].
Holographic entanglement entropy. Nevertheless, the concept of entanglement entropy
has also garnered increased attention in recent decades due to its significant role in holography
(AdS/CFT correspondence) [19–21]. Holography entails a duality between boundary quantum
field theories and bulk gravitational theories, offering a compelling framework for understanding the emergence of spacetime geometry from quantum entanglement. Particularly notable

1 Introduction

Bulk reconstruction in holography. It is worth noting that, in most studies of holographic
entanglement entropy, the standard approach is the bottom-up methodology. In this framework, gravitational bulk theories are employed to depict the realistic dual boundary quantum
systems (e.g., characterized by broken translational symmetries), and the RT formula is used
to study the associated entanglement entropy.
Nonetheless, despite significant advancements over the past decade, which provide
compelling evidence that the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical
degrees of freedom plays a pivotal role in shaping the emergent holographic spacetime
geometry and its dynamics, an open question remains. Specifically, it is still unclear which
bulk gravity model can accurately reproduces the entanglement features of a given quantum
system on the boundary and how to identify such models.
One essential approach for identifying such bulk gravity theories is termed ‘bulk reconstruction’, representing a non-trivial inverse problem entailing holographic mapping from
lower (boundary) to higher (bulk) dimensions. A captivating aspect within this endeavor is the
reconstruction of the metric in the holographic spacetime.3 There are numerous methodologies
for bulk metric reconstruction, leveraging diverse boundary physical quantities. These include
the source and expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor [39], singularities in sets of
correlation functions [40, 41], entanglement entropy of boundary intervals [42–45],4 differential
entropy, a UV-finite combination of entanglement entropy [47–49], divergence structure of
boundary n-point functions [50, 51], modular Hamiltonians of boundary subregions [52, 53],
Wilson loops related to quark potential [54], four-point correlators in an excited quantum
1

The RT formula, along with its subsequent generalizations [23–26], provides a deeper elucidation of the
pivotal role of entanglement in holographic duality. Another noteworthy entanglement measure is the reflected
entropy, which possesses a gravity dual known as the entanglement wedge cross section [27–30].

entanglement in diverse holographic matters.

Additional significant branches can be found in [35–38], with particular emphasis on bulk operator reconstruction.

is its connection exemplified in the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula [22], which establishes a
relationship between the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in the boundary field theory
and the area of the minimal surface in the bulk corresponding to the same region. 1
By leveraging the RT formula and understanding gravity through the lens of quantum
entanglement, the holographic examination of entanglement entropy not only offers a more
manageable approach to studying and computing this measure, but also yields general
lessons applicable other branches of physics such, as quantum field theories and strongly
coupled many-body physics [31]. For instance, the c-theorem, established in two-dimensional
conformal field theory, is derived from analyzing how entanglement entropy evolves under
renormalization group flows [32]. Also, holographic entanglement entropy proves instrumental
in the study of the aforementioned condensed matter physics by characterizing various phases
of matter, exemplified by holographic superconductors [33].2 This elucidates phenomena such
as phase transitions, quantum criticality, and topological order, offering valuable insights into
the entanglement properties of strongly correlated quantum systems.

state [55], and holographic complexities [56, 57], among others. It is noteworthy that much
of the research on metric reconstruction has been motivated by the notion that spacetime
is constructed from quantum entanglement [22, 58–62].5

Motivation of this paper. In this manuscript, we investigate the reconstruction of the
holographic bulk metric through machine learning of the boundary entanglement entropy.
Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning in this context.
Note that a machine learning method has been applied in related contexts [77, 78], where
authors inferred the dual geometry from a given entanglement entropy using the RT formula
and deep learning methods. However, due to inherent discontinuities in their algorithm, the
reconstructed metric lacks continuity. Additionally, for simplicity, the entanglement entropy
was assumed to have the dual geometry when only the blackening factor f (z) is unknown,
for instance, h(z) = 1 in (2.1). We intend to enhance this work by incorporating a neural
ODE approach and a more generic metric setup, i.e., any function of f (z) and h(z),7 making
it more compatible with bulk reconstruction programs for continuous and generic metrics.
It is also worth mentioning that when h(z) = 1, one may not need to resort to machine
learning holography; instead, Bilson’s method [44] can be utilized to invert the RT formula,
generating the metric as output and entanglement entropy as input. Nevertheless, for
completeness, we review Bilson’s method in the main text and discuss its limitations when
h(z) ̸= 1, motivating the use of machine learning holography to find the complete metric
from entanglement entropy.
5

Another notable progression in investigating bulk reconstruction in holography involves a novel approach
from quantum many-body systems, termed the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) of
tensor networks [60, 63–65].
6
Other related works that extract the spacetime metric using machine learning, independent of holography,
can be found in [87–90].
7
In the scenario of isotropic geometries, (2.1) represents the most general metric setup. Specifically, metrics
where (gtt ̸= gzz ̸= gxx ) can always be expressed in the form of (2.1) through coordinate transformations. For
detailed discussions, refer to [92].

Machine learning and holography. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as
a promising approach to addressing bulk reconstruction by identifying the underlying bulk
theory, such as reconstructing the bulk metric. Efficient holographic modeling has been
successfully demonstrated through the application of machine learning techniques with various
physical quantities, including lattice QCD data of the chiral condensate, hadron spectra,
meson spectrum, shear viscosity, optical conductivity, and entanglement entropy, and so
forth [66–86].6
Machine learning holography not only facilitates the construction of data-driven holographic models but also provides insights into deeper understanding of holography itself.
This approach is referred to as the AdS/DL correspondence, and establishes connections
between deep learning (DL) — a form of machine learning utilizing deep neural networks —
and holography. Here, deep learning functions as a solver for the inverse problem, enabling
the determination of the bulk metric upon traning the neural network. Readers interested in
grasping the essential concept of AdS/DL within a simplified framework are encouraged to
refer [91], which illustrates this concept through a classical mechanics problem.

It is noteworthy that the Gubser-Rocha model [93] can be derived through a top-down approach. Specifically,
for d = 3, it results from a consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on AdS 4 ×
S 7 [93], while for d = 4, it is derived from ten-dimensional type IIB String Theory as the near-horizon
limit of D3-branes [93, 96]. See also [97, 98] for discussions on top-down holographic superconductors from
string/M-theory. Consequently, our study can also be regarded as an exploration of such top-down models
through the lens of machine learning.

JHEP01(2025)025

As illustrative examples for our purpose, in this study, we initially employ two representative holographic entanglement entropy models with h(z) ̸= 1: the Gubser-Rocha model [93]
and the holographic superconductor model [94, 95], where the former has been particularly
instrumental in examining the characteristics of strange metals.8 Moreover, in addition to
the aforementioned holographic matter models, we incorporate entanglement entropy data
from quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we utilize data obtained from a fermionic
tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional systems [99] to ascertain the
corresponding emergent bulk metric.
In essence, we propose applying data-driven and machine learning methodologies to unveil
the emergent continuous metric based on boundary entanglement entropy data. Analyzing
various entanglement entropy dataset within the generic and continuous metric configuration,
our objective is to establish machine learning holography as both a practical and theoretical
framework. Through our investigation, we aim to offer valuable insights into the fundamental
aspects of quantum entanglement, thereby deepening our understanding of many-body
quantum physics and potentially advancing the exploration of holographic duality.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a quick review of the RT formula
concerning the holographic entanglement entropy. Additionally, in section 3, we discuss
Bilson’s method for generating the metric from entanglement entropy and address its limitation
in studying the complete metric. Section 4 introduces a machine learning method tailored
to determine the continuous/generic metric based on provided entanglement entropy. As
input data of machine learning method, we utilize both the holographic entanglement entropy
and entanglement entropy from a fermionic tight-binding chain. Finally, section 5 is devoted
to conclusions.

Holographic entanglement entropy. The holographic dictionary to study the entanglement entropy (S) is the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [22, 62]. The formula allows us to
compute the entanglement entropy of the entangling region on the boundary by examining
the corresponding region the bulk spacetime as
S=

Area(γ)
,
4GN

(2.3)

where γ is the area if the minimal surface in the bulk, which is anchored at the AdS boundary.
In this paper, we focus on a strip-shape entangling region. See figure 1: the minimal surface
takes the form of a yellow surface with a width ℓ in x-direction and extends infinitely Ω in
y-directions. z∗ represents the maximal z value of this minimal surface in the bulk.
Within the metric (2.1), it is straightforward [22, 62] to find the geometric quantities
for (2.3), S and ℓ, as

Bilson’s method

It is instructive to note that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.4) establishes a relationship
where the entanglement entropy is derived from a given metric. In other words, the metric
serves as the input data, while the entanglement entropy emerges as the output.

The integral equation presented here shows how one function, F (z∗ ), can be expressed in
terms of another, Y (z∗ ), with the roles reversed in the “Solution” part of the equation.

where we used the chain rule for derivatives, including how changes in the entanglement entropy

To understand (3.2), note that the chain rule splits the derivative into two parts: the
changes of S with respect to z∗ , and the change of z∗ with respect to ℓ. These components

On the other hands, Bilson’s method [44] attempts to invert the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.4),
flipping the roles of metric and entanglement entropy. Here, the metric becomes the output,
while the entanglement entropy becomes the input.
Bilson’s method involves two main ingredients. Firstly, it employs the handbook of
integral equations [100] to express:

where the first term involving the limit as z approaches z∗ captures the local behavior near
z∗ , while the integral term encodes contributions from the entire interval [0, z∗ ].
3.2 Reconstruction formula
To leverage Bilson’s method effectively, it is beneficial to choose the following coordinate
(3.5)

h(z) = 1 .

This choice simplifies the mathematics significantly. We will address the general case where
h(z) ̸= 1 towards the conclusion of this subsection.

L Ω z∗2

Y (z) :=

Using these identification, the “Solution” in (3.1) provides the reconstruction formula for

(3.9)

The resulting expression (3.8) represents the reconstruction formula provided by Bilson [44], where S(z∗ ) is derived from the data S(ℓ), with ℓ interchangeable with z∗ through (3.9).
Essentially, given the entanglement entropy S(ℓ), the metric component f (z) can be generated as the output.
Reconstruction formula II. Although (3.8) presents a novel approach, the entanglement entropy data S(ℓ) predominantly hinges on the UV cutoff ϵ. Hence, from a practical
standpoint, it proves beneficial [57] to employ an alternative reconstruction formula derived from the subsystem size in (2.4). Analogous to the entanglement entropy scenario,
employing (3.1) yields:

(3.10)

where ℓ(z∗ ) serves as the input and f (z) emerges as the output.
However, it is noteworthy that the input data ℓ(z∗ ) essentially derives from (3.9), where
the entanglement entropy S(ℓ) is provided. Thus, this second reconstruction formula (3.10)
also represents a scenario where the input data is the entanglement entropy.

–7–

JHEP01(2025)025

Reconstruction formula I. Subsequently, we can recast the entanglement entropy (2.4)
into the form

Example: pure AdS geometry. To better understand the application of the reconstruction
formula, we consider an example where the analytic expression for the entanglement entropy
is available. For the pure AdS geometry by
(3.11)

f (z) = 1 ,
the entanglement entropy (2.4) can be analytically obtained as
   2 

S = SCFT =

(3.12)

As the initial step of Bilson’s method, we can first put the given the entanglement entropy
from (3.12) into (3.9) and find ℓ(z∗ )
ℓ(z∗ ) =

(3.13)

Then, by plugging this expression into the reconstruction formula (3.10), we can deduce
(3.14)

f (r) = 1 ,
which is consistent with the expected pure AdS metric, as given in (3.11).

Limitation of Bilson’s method. While Bilson’s method offers a structured approach
to reconstructing the metric, it is not without its limitations. It is straightforward to find
that for the generic metric where
h(z) ̸= 1 ,

(3.15)

Bilson’s reformulation formulas, (3.10) and (3.2), become

Then, one can notice that the reconstruction program cannot proceed due to the inconsistency
between the number of input data and output data. In other words, given a single data
S(ℓ), one needs to determine two functions f (z) and h(z). Therefore, unless h(z) is provided,
Bilson’s method cannot fully reconstruct the metric.
Nevertheless, this limitation is not surprising, as previously noted [44]. An alternative
approach that may alleviate some of these limitations involves transforming to a different
coordinate system,

3.3 Example: linear-axion model
Despite the limitations that Bilson’s method may entail, it remains a novel approach for
constructing the blackening factor f (z). We conclude this section by considering an example
where bulk reconstruction via Bilson’s method is viable: when h(z) = 1.
In this context, we investigate the bulk reconstruction process when the entanglement
entropy is provided numerically. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the
inaugural exploration of the numerical evaluation of the reconstruction formula (3.10).
Linear-axion model. For this purpose, we consider the linear-axion model [101], characterized by the action:

It is noteworthy that axion theories [101–103] have proven valuable in studying strongly
coupled condensed matter systems [104–109] through analyses involving conductivity [110–
120], transport coefficients [121–141], and the collective dynamics of strongly coupled

Even though we can reconstruct g(r) from the given S(ℓ) using (3.18), the inability to
determine χ(r) means that the full metric cannot be completely specified.9
In light of these challenges, the next section explores how machine learning techniques
can be used to overcome the limitations of Bilson’s method, enabling the reconstruction
of both f (z) and h(z) from the given S(ℓ).

applications [34, 160–165] and the application of the AdS/Deep learning correspondence [80].10
It is worth noting that [80] successfully generated the metric of linear-axion models based
on given boundary optical conductivity data using a machine learning method. Here, we
aim to demonstrate that the reconstruction formula (3.10) can yield the same bulk metric
obtained from the machine learning method [80]. To accomplish this, we utilize the same
parameter set employed in [80]:

Holographic entanglement entropy. Plugging (3.20) into (2.4), one can numerically
evaluate the entanglement entropy. Nevertheless, due to the UV divergence, it is advantageous
to examine its finite piece, denoted as SFinite , given in (2.5).
Considering the parameters provided in (3.21), we illustrate SFinite in figure 2.11 Then, to
utilize the numerically evaluated entanglement entropy SFinite as the input data for Bilson’s
method, we employ the power-law fitting curve

first time.

Bilson’s method and bulk reconstruction. Now that we have the expression of SFinite
from (3.22), we can determine the entanglement entropy S using (2.5). Subsequently, similar
to the pure AdS example in (3.11), the next step for Bilson’s method entails inserting the
numerically obtained S into the reconstruction formula (3.9) to determine ℓ(z∗ ). However, in
this instance, we numerically evaluate ℓ(z∗ ) (as illustrated in the left panel of figure 3) and
subsequently determine the bulk metric component f (z) numerically via the reconstruction
formula (3.10).
The resulting f (z) from Bilson’s method is depicted by the solid line in the right panel of
figure 3. We confirm that this f (z) successfully reconstructs the target metric f (r) specified
in (3.20). Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the metric of the linear-axion model can
be constructed not only via the machine learning method utilizing optical conductivity [80],
but also through Bilson’s method (3.10) with entanglement entropy.

Machine learning method

In this section, we investigate bulk reconstruction employing the machine learning approach,
which plays a pivotal role in revealing the complete metric described in (2.1). Our analysis
demonstrates that by implementing machine learning techniques, we can overcome the
constraints inherent in Bilson’s method: specifically, we achieve the reconstruction of both
f (z) and h(z) from the provided S(ℓ).

4.1 Methodology: neural ODEs and Monte-Carlo integration

Neural ODEs. In this paper, we utilize the neural ODE framework within the context
of the holographic study of quantum information, with a particular focus on entanglement
entropy. Our machine learning methodology represents an integrated version of the neural
ODE, which we refer to as neural integration.
First, let us briefly review the concept of the ResNet using a simple ODE example:
∂z F = G(z, F ; θ(z)) ,

(4.1)

where F is the unknown function of z, G is a given function. Here, θ(z) represents a general
hidden function within the ODE, which serves as the trainable parameters in the neural
network. This equation can be solved using ODE solvers by discretizing the z interval into
small steps ∆z. For example, if we choose the Euler method as the solver, the approximate
numerical solution FN is given by
FN = F1 +

N
−1
X

G(zn , Fn ; θn ) · ∆z ,

(4.2)

n=1

where the z interval is discretized into N steps, and F1 is the given initial value at z1 (for
more details, see [80]). Due to this discretization, the training parameters are also discretized;
for instance, θn (zn ) could be the discretized metric fn (zn ). This is the fundamental concept
of ResNet for generating the discretized bulk metric [66, 67].
The approximate numerical solution F can be more generally expressed as:
Ffinal = ODE Solver [G; Finitial , (zfinal , zinitial ); θ(z)] .

(4.3)

For instance, for the Euler method described in (4.2), we have
(Finitial , Ffinal ) = (F1 , FN )

and

(zinitial , zfinal ) = (1, N − 1) ,

with the training parameter θ chosen as θn for the ResNet.

JHEP01(2025)025

As discussed in the introduction, the machine learning holography framework, also known as
the AdS/DL correspondence, has been employed in elucidating the holographic bulk theory
that underpins quantum systems on the boundary.
In the pioneering studies of the AdS/DL correspondence [66, 67], significant advancements
have primarily been achieved by discretizing the holographic bulk metric using deep learning
techniques. For example, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) can be solved within
the framework of a residual neural network (ResNet) [166], which is composed of residual
blocks [167].
In recent years, to achieve a continuous holographic bulk spacetime, a continuous version
of ResNet, known as the neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) [168], has been
developed. By employing neural ODEs in machine learning holography, the continuous bulk
metric has been reconstructed using boundary data, as demonstrated in the contexts of
quantum chromodynamics [72] and strongly interacting condensed matter systems [80, 81].

Figure 4. A structure of a deep neural network. It consists of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each.
The nodes are fully connected each other. Through the learning procedure, the continuous function
D(z) is generated where the input is z =: z01 .

To ensure that the discrete hidden function becomes a continuous function, the central
idea of neural ODEs [168] is to replace the discrete parameter θ(z) = θn (zn ) with a continuous
deep neural network θ(z) = D(z). This deep neural network consists of multiple layers through
which data is processed, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer.
The deep neural network is defined as follows
D(z) = WM · ϕ(· · · ϕ(W2 · ϕ(W1 z + b1 ) + b2 ) · · · ) + bM ,

(4.5)

where ϕ is an activation function, WM is the weight matrix of M -th layer, and bM is the bias
vector of M -th layer. The activation function is a non-linear function applied to the output of
each layer, enabling the network to model complex patterns. In this paper, we use the rectified
linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function: ReLU(z) = max(0, z). The other parameters
(weights and biases) are adjusted during training to minimize errors in the loss function.
Continuous training variables in deep neural networks, primarily weights and biases,
are essential for the learning process. Weights determine the “strength” of connections
between nodes, while biases provide each layer with a trainable constant value to help the
model fit the data better. For an illustrative sketch of a deep neural network, see figure 4,
which shows the case of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each. By employing iterative forward
and backward propagation steps, along with optimization algorithms, these variables are
continuously refined to minimize errors and enhance the model’s efficacy.
In our deep neural network computations, we utilize the PyTorch framework [169], an
open-source machine learning library, and deep neural networks are initialized with 3 hidden
layers, each containing 20 nodes.
Neural integrations. In this manuscript, drawing inspiration from solving ODEs using deep
neural networks, we introduce a method for solving integrations through machine learning
techniques. Termed “neural integration,” this approach aligns well with our objective:
employing machine learning holography to analyze entanglement entropy (2.5).
To demonstrate further, let us consider the following integration, which can be obtained
by equation (4.1):

where we substitute θ(z) with the deep neural network D(z). Subsequently, our primary
objectives, the subsystem size ℓ (2.4), and the (finite piece) entanglement entropy SFinite (2.5),

where SFinite (and ℓ) is compared with F , and the metric components with the deep neural
network D(z) in (4.5), i.e.,
f (z) ←→ Df (z) ,

h(z) ←→ Dh (z) .

(4.8)

More on the setup for machine learning holography. We further elaborate on the
setup for our machine learning methodology. Instead of utilizing (4.8), we adopt the following
technically convenient metric ansatz:
h

i

f (z) = (1 − z) 1 + (a + 1)z − z 2 Df (z) ,

h(z) = 1 + az − z 2 Dh (z) .

(4.9)

This choice is motivated by several reasons. Firstly, we impose the horizon condition at
the horizon (z = 1) as f (1) = 0, and the asymptotic AdS boundary condition at the
boundary (z = 0) as f (0) = h(0) = 1. Furthermore, from the near-boundary expansion of
GS (z; f (z), h(z)) in (4.7) together with (2.5), it follows that
GS (z; f (z), h(z)) ≈

h′ (0) − f ′ (0)
,
z

(4.10)

which would result in a logarithmic UV divergence in SFinite , which is assumed to be absent in
our study.13 Within our ansatz (4.9), we eliminate this UV divergence since h′ (0) = f ′ (0) = a.
Essentially, within our ansatz (4.9), we have three training parameters in our machine learning
method: the linear coefficient a, and the weights and biases of Df (z) and Dh (z).
Then, substituting (4.9) into (4.7) and initializing random values for a, weights, and
biases, SFinite (ℓ) can be computed. As an intermediate numerical step, both SFinite (z∗ ) and
ℓ(z∗ ) are evaluated within the selected range z∗ ∈ [0.1, 0.99].
Last but not least, we discuss the loss function L employed in our computation, which
is defined as
1 X (m)
L=
SFinite (ℓ) − SFinite (ℓ) + s(m) − s ,
(4.11)
Nℓ ℓ
12

It is noteworthy that while bulk holographic geometry is derived from given entanglement entropy using
deep learning methods [77, 78], the authors in [77] adopt ResNet together with the Runge-Kutta method
within the ODE framework (4.1), ensuring that the emergent metric remains a discrete function. Using the
different machine learning method based on the transformer algorithm, the discrete metric is also generated
in [78].
13
Within the models of interest, we have checked that such an additional UV divergence term is absent.

JHEP01(2025)025

The optimization of deep neural networks conducts through the learning process to
achieve convergence between the estimated and intended values (given the input dataset
SFinite and ℓ). The estimated value is obtained via numerical integration in (4.7). In this
study, Monte Carlo integration serves as the numerical integrator, with Torchquad [170], an
extension package of PyTorch, utilized for Monte Carlo integration.12

4.2 Emergent spacetime from holographic entanglement entropy
Utilizing the aforementioned machine learning methodologies, we commence with the training
procedure. Initially, within this section, we illustrate the emergence of full spacetime from
holographic entanglement entropy. To achieve this, we employ two exemplary and extensively
researched toy models of holographic matters, namely the Gubser-Rocha model [93] and
holographic superconductor model [94, 95], where the former has been instrumental in
examining the properties of strange metals. Our analysis here aims to demonstrate the
machine learning’s capability in accurately discerning the metric (2.1) based on holographic
entanglement entropy.
4.2.1 Linear-axion model
As a warm-up, we verify the efficacy of our machine learning approach in scenarios where
h(z) = 1, consistent with the results obtained through Bilson’s method outlined in section 3.3:
the linear-axion model (3.19).
Within the same dataset (3.21), we input data derived from the holographic entanglement entropy of the linear-axion model into the machine learning framework. Recall
the entanglement entropy depicted in figure 2, with fitting data represented by (3.22) and
corresponding coefficients listed in table 1.
In figure 5, we illustrate that our machine learning methodology successfully elucidates
the black hole geometry f (z) within the holographic bulk spacetime. The emergent metric,
as identified by the machine learning process, aligns closely with the geometry of the linearaxion model described by (3.20). In appendix B, we discuss the detailed discussion of
the training procedure employed in our machine learning method, together with the error
estimation analysis.
4.2.2 Gubser-Rocha model
Subsequently, we apply the machine learning methodology to the Gubser-Rocha model [93]
where the metric component now h(z) ̸= 1. Its action is defined as follows

where Nℓ denotes the number of the data points for ℓ. The first term quantifies the disparity
(m)
between the output entanglement entropy data SFinite (ℓ) computed by the machine learning
and the provided input data SFinite (ℓ). The second term, referred to as the penalty term,
corresponds to the thermal entropy (s) (2.2), where the superscript index (m) indicates that
the thermal entropy is obtained through machine learning. This term is important for shaping
the loss function and influencing the optimization process.
In principle, alternative penalty terms could be chosen. However, opting for the thermal
entropy as the penalty term offers several intriguing aspects. Firstly, it aligns structurally
with the first term in the loss function. In other words, s(m) is obtained through machine
learning, while s is given from the input data. It is worth recalling that thermal entropy can
be inferred from the large subsystem size limit as SFinite ≈ s ℓ [22, 62]. Furthermore, through
the utilization of thermal entropy, an additional horizon condition on h(1) can be introduced
via (2.2), complementing the demonstration provided below (4.9). Thus, in aggregate, we have
imposed two AdS boundary conditions and two horizon condition on the metric components.

where 16πGN = L = 1. Here, ϕ represents the dilaton field, the field strength is F = dA,
and the axion field ψI is also included. Notably, the Gubser-Rocha model (4.12) stands out
as one of the most prominent and celebrated holographic models, pivotal in elucidating the
properties of strange metals. Remarkably, the Gubser-Rocha model facilitates the study
of linear-in-T resistivity, attributed to the nature of the infrared fixed point [110, 111, 113,
117, 119, 120, 130, 139, 171–173].14
The Gubser-Rocha model (4.12) possesses another attractive feature in that it allows for
the analytic background solutions. Within our metric (2.1), it is described as

It is pertinent to note that the model also manifests characteristics relevant to high-Tc cuprate superconductivity, such as Homes’s law in high-Tc superconductors [117, 173]. Furthermore, investigations into
the phase diagram utilizing fermionic spectral functions [130] or conductivity [141] have been undertaken.
Additionally, discussions on certain limitations in describing transport anomalies, such as the Hall angle, have
also been addressed [120, 172].

Table 2. Numerical fitting coefficients for (3.22) of Gubser-Rocha model.

To initiate our machine learning methodology, we initially compute the holographic
entanglement entropy. Since the Gubser-Rocha model entails two free parameters: (µ, β),
akin to the linear-axion model (3.19), we opt for the same dataset (3.21).
Subsequently, by substituting (4.13) into (2.5), one can compute the entanglement entropy
numerically. Employing the parameters specified in (3.21), we depict SFinite in figure 6, where
we find its compatibility with (3.22) when fitted, with coefficients detailed in table 2.
It is worth noting that the value of c0 for the Gubser-Rocha model is finite, unlike
that for the linear-axion model as shown in table 1. To elucidate this distinction, we
analytically investigate c0 for our metric (2.1) in the limit of a small subsystems, as detailed
in appendix A. Specifically, we examine c0 as follows
c0 =

h′ (0)
.

(4.16)

We observe that when h(z) = 1, c0 equals 0, consistent with the numerical findings in the
linear-axion model. Conversely, when h(z) ̸= 1, c0 can be non-zero. This is evident in the
case of the Gubser-Rocha model (4.13): we checked that our numerical results in table 2
align with the analytical formula (4.16).
Finally, we plug data obtained from the holographic entanglement entropy of the GubserRocha model into the machine learning framework, utilizing the fitting data described
by (3.22) and the corresponding coefficients outlined in table 2. Subsequently, in figure 7,
we demonstrate that our machine learning methodology can reveal the complete black hole
geometry f (z) and h(z) within the holographic bulk spacetime. This validation underscores the

where h(z) ̸= 1. See also appendix B for the error estimation analysis of Gubser-Rocha model.
4.2.3 Holographic superconductors
We proceed to discuss another prominent example of spacetime within holography, characterized by h(z) ̸= 1, known as the holographic superconductor model [94, 95], often referred to as
the HHH model after its proponents, Hartnoll, Herzog, and Horowitz. This model stands as
one of the most widely studied frameworks in applied holography to condensed matter systems,
garnering significant attention in the field (for comprehensive reviews, refer to [174, 175]).
Precisely speaking, the U(1) symmetry in the dual field theory of the HHH model is global
rather than local, characterizing it as a superfluid rather than a superconductor. While some
aspects, such as electric conductivity, may not distinguish between the two, other features, such
as the dynamics of vortices and collective low-energy modes, markedly differentiate between a
superfluid and a superconductor. For instance, collective excitations in holographic superfluids
are second sound waves (superfluid Goldstone mode) [176, 177] which are absence in the
superconductors. Explorations of collective excitations in holographic superconductors are
conducted in [178], incorporating dynamical boundary gauge fields and explicitly confirming
the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Nevertheless, for the sake of consistency in our discussion,
we continue to refer to the HHH model as representing holographic superconductors.
The HHH model [94, 95] is given as

where we impose the boundary condition U(0) = V (0) = 1 to ensure the asymptotic AdS
geometry. Additionally, for the matter fields, we choose
A = (1 − z)a(z) dt ,

Φ = z η(z) ,

(4.19)

Notably, the boundary behavior of these matter fields is characterized by
At = µ − ρz + · · · ,

Φ = Φ(−) z + Φ(+) z 2 + · · · .

(4.20)

According to the holographic dictionary, µ represents the chemical potential, ρ stands for
the charge density, and in the asymptotic form of Φ, Φ(−) denotes the source while Φ(+)
represents the condensate. In our chosen ansatz (4.19), we straightforwardly derive the
chemical potential µ as µ = a(0) and the source Φ(−) as Φ(−) = η(0).
Next, as the boundary condition for the superconducting phase, we set the source to be
zero, Φ(−) = 0, to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking, expressed as
√
(4.21)
Φ− = 0 ,
and
⟨O2 ⟩ := 2 Φ+ ,
√
where the factor of 2 in defining the condensate ⟨O2 ⟩ follows from [94], serving as a
convenient normalization. Therefore, essentially, using the numerically obtained solutions,
one can discern between the superconducting phase, characterized by Φ(+) ̸= 0, and a normal
phase, where Φ = 0, by computing the temperatures using (2.2). We present the plot of the
condensate in figure 8, depicting condensation when m2 = −2 and q = 3, with a critical
temperature of Tc /µ = 0.156, consistent with findings in [95].
Similarly to the Gubser-Rocha model, we begin our machine learning methodology by
computing the holographic entanglement entropy. For the superconductor examples, we
select three representative datasets characterized by
T /Tc = (1.4 , 0.75 , 0.4) ,

illustrated as colored dots in figure 8. Subsequently, by substituting the obtained numerical
metric solutions (4.18) into (2.5), we compute the entanglement entropy, as shown in figure 9.
We find its agreement with (3.22) when fitted, with coefficients provided in table 3. Here,
we also confirmed that the analytical formula (4.16) yields consistent numerical values for
c0 in the superconductor model.
Finally, we incorporate data derived from the holographic entanglement entropy of the
superconductor model into the machine learning framework. This involves utilizing the
fitting data described by (3.22) along with the corresponding coefficients outlined in table 3.
Subsequently, in figure 10, we showcase how our machine learning methodology proficiently
reveals the complete black hole geometry f (z) and h(z) for the holographic superconductor.
This validation again underscores the effectiveness of our machine learning approach in
accurately capturing the entire geometry, even in scenarios where h(z) ̸= 1. The error
estimation analysis for the holographic superconductor model is given in appendix B.
It is worth noting that the functional form of h(z) for superconductors differs from that
of the Gubser-Rocha model (cfr. figure 10 vs. figure 7): h(z) monotonically decreases towards
the horizon for superconductor models, unlike the Gubser-Rocha model. Nonetheless, we
find that our machine learning approach can adeptly reconstruct all types of h(z).

we leverage data on the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional systems [99], specifically
focusing on data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling.
It is worth noting that [99] have also investigated the entanglement entropy in higherdimensional systems, which could be relevant to our AdS4 setup (2.1). Nonetheless, unlike
our holographic setup, the analysis in [99] does not consider strip-shaped entangling regions.
Hence, in this section, we concentrate on the one-dimensional (1 + 1D) case.

where it is referred to as the universal scaling function.15 One comment is in order. By
rescaling βv to β, one may eliminate the depencence on group velocity in the formula.
However, we do not adopt this approach, as it has been reported that the group velocity
may vary between different systems. Specifically, the group velocity can be calculated based
on the lowest energy within the symmetry sector associated with the crystal momentum.
For further discussion, refer to [99, 180].

In principle, SDATA may contain a non-universal constant, which does not affect the scaling behavior
of ℓ and, therefore, is also not explicitly specified in [99]. Similarly, we omit such a term in our analysis.
Notably, in the study of entanglement entropy, examining the derivative of S with respect to the spatial size
of the entalgment region ℓ can prove advantageous. This approach, as suggested by [179], offers data that are
unaffected by the UV cutoff, thereby also avoiding the appearance of a non-universal constant.
16
The presence of gapless excitations can be indicative of a critical point. At this point, the system does
not have a well-defined energy scale (gap) and exhibits critical fluctuations over all length scales. In a
one-dimensional fermionic chain, the critical point manifests as a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi
points k = ±π/2 as E(k) ≈ vF (k ∓ π/2), leading to low-energy excitations where vF is the Fermi velocity.
17
Combining (4.32) with (4.33), one can notice that c does not play any role in SFinite . Nevertheless, we set
L = 16πGN = 1 and β = 2π in order for the metric of the BTZ black hole (4.27). It is noteworthy that the
central charge c can appear in our machine learning method through the thermal entropy (4.36).

JHEP01(2025)025

As a supplementary note, it is worth mentioning the following. Let us consider the entanglement entropy S pertaining to the bipartition of a one-dimensional quantum many-body
system into a subsystem of length ℓ. When the system parameters and energy (temperature)
fall within a quantum critical regime of the model under consideration, established principles
dictate that the entanglement entropy may adhere to a universal scaling function [181–183].
Notably, in [99], it has been demonstrated that for the typical quantum many-body
systems complying with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, the entanglement entropy
of eigenstates can be characterized by a universal scaling function. Particularly, in critical
one-dimensional systems with linear dispersion at low energies, a universal scaling function
follows from CFT.16
In this paper, within machine learning framework, we focus on analyzing data obtained
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling [99], where it has been demonstrated
to adhere to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and is describable by a CFT with
c = 1. Notably, the entanglement entropy data SDATA from this chain is found to be with
parameters (c, v) = (1, 2) in (4.33): see figure 11.
Furthermore, in our machine learning method, for the sake of comparison, we also
investigate the BTZ case (4.29). In essense, we have two datasets available:

Last but not least, it is worth noting that in our machine learning method aimed at
determining the complete metric, we utilize information of the thermal entropy s in (4.24).
When dealing with data, obtaining such thermal entropy is straightforward, as it can be
derived from the slope of the entanglement entropy in the large subsystem size limit [99]
(ℓ ≫ 1) :

S ≈ SDATA ≈ s ℓ ,

(4.36)

where we employ (4.33), which aligns with holography [22, 62].18 Intuitively, when ℓ ≫ 1
the subsystem effectively encompasses the entire system, implying that the minimal surface
lies along the black hole horizon [45, 184], suggesting a potential connection between the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.3) and the thermal entropy density s.
Finally, we utilize data obtained from the entanglement entropy of a fermionic tightbinding chain at half filling, as depicted in figure 11, into our machine learning framework.
Subsequently, as illustrated in figure 12, we demonstrate how our machine learning methodology adeptly uncovers the complete black hole geometry f (z) and h(z), even leveraging
entanglement entropy data from quantum many-body systems.
Two noteworthy findings are made from our analysis. Firstly, as demonstrated in figure 12,
our machine learning method accurately captures the dual geometry of the CFT, specifically
in the BTZ case. This validation suggests that our approach can yield continuous geometries
from the entanglement entropy of the CFT, representing an advancement beyond the machine
learning analysis that produces discontinuous geometries of the BTZ black holes [77, 78].
Secondly, the functional form of the emergent metric derived from the fermionic tightbinding chain at half filling exhibits similar aspects to that of the Gubser-Rocha model: cfr.
figure 7 vs. figure 12. The blackening factor f (z) attains a maximum value, forming a peak
between the AdS boundary and the horizon, while, the function h(z) increases monotonically
towards the horizon. This resemblance may not be surprising, as both models describe
the metallic phases. In the Gubser-Rocha model, metallic behavior is characterized by the
linear-temperature resistivity, whereas in the fermionic tight-binding chain, it is characterized
by the gapless excitations.
18

We also confirmed that the slop of the holographic entanglement entropy in the large ℓ limit, given in
figure 2, 6, 9 are consistent with the thermal entropy from (2.2).

and fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling (blue data). Solid lines are the metric from machine
learning method, while dotted lines denote the true metric of BTZ black hole (4.27).

We conclude this section by providing a heuristic and indicative argument for the peak
structure of f (z) in the fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling. According to holographic
duality, the radial coordinate z in the bulk corresponds to the energy scale in the boundary
theory. Thus, a peak at some z may be interpreted as indicating a significant energy scale in
fermionic chain. This could represent the energy at which a density of states (DOS) peak,
indicating a high DOS at a particular energy level. For q
instance, DOS for a one-dimentional
fermionic tight-binding model is given by D(E) ≈ 1/ 4t2h − E 2 , where th is the hopping
parameter and E is the energy [185, 186].19 This form highlights the characteristic features
of the DOS in such a system, indicating singularities at E = ±2th , known as Van Hove
singularities.
In this context, we speculate that a peak structure in the AdS bulk, as depicted in
figure 12, may be associated with features of a fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling,
particularly as the reminiscent of high DOS due to Van Hove singularities: E = ±2th where
th = 1 in our entanglement entropy data [99]. Nevertheless, the precise nature of this peak
within the bulk direction remains insufficiently understood and is likely influenced by the
specific properties of the tight-binding model under consideration as well. Therefore, our
argument remains speculative and a more rigorous investigation with thorough analysis are
required to attain a comprehensive understanding.

Conclusions

We have investigated the bulk reconstruction of the AdS black hole spacetime by leveraging
quantum entanglement measures on the boundary field theory. Notably, by incorporating a
neural network framework for the Ryu-Takayanagi formula within the AdS/DL correspondence,
we introduce a machine learning approach to uncover the dual holographic emergent bulk
metric from the entanglement entropy data of quantum many-body systems.
19

Recall that the energy dispersion is E(k) = −2th cos k with k being the wavevector in the first Brillouin
1 dk
zone, typically k ∈ [−π, π] for a one-dimensional chain. Then, DOS can be computed via D(E) = 2π

Our analysis of various entanglement entropy datasets within a continuous and generic
metric configuration marks significant progress in the field of machine learning holography,
both practically and theoretically. By employing the neural ODE methodology together
with Monte-Carlo integration, our machine learning algorithm constructs a neural network
from the entanglement entropy data, where the continuous network geometry represents
the emergent holographic geometry of the quantum many-body state. Furthermore, our
algorithm’s ability to handle a generic metric ansatz (2.1) enhances its practical applicability,
enabling the use of potential experimental and simulated quantum information data from
strongly coupled field theories for gravity duals.
Before our work, the authors in [77] also applied deep learning techniques within the
framework of holography to deduce the bulk metric from holographic entanglement entropy.
They employed a residual neural network, composed of residual blocks, which produced a
discretized version of the holographic bulk metric. Our research has two differences from [77].
First, we implemented the neural ODE methodology, which utilizes a continuous function as
the training variable, enabling the construction of neural networks that yield a continuous
holographic bulk metric from the entanglement entropy data. Second, our machine learning
framework is capable of generating a general metric, whereas [77] dealt with a simplified metric
ansatz (h(z) = 1), where Bilson’s method can be advantageous. Accordingly, our method
may be applied to more practical and realistic gravity models of strongly coupled matter.
Additionally, the authors in [78] explored holographic entanglement entropy using a
machine learning framework, albeit with a different approach. They employed the transformer
algorithm, commonly used in natural language processing, to enable the machine to learn
patterns from large datasets and predict new inputs based on trained network. Nevertheless,
unlike [77] and our approach, which focus on generating the discrete/continuous bulk metric
from the entanglement entropy data, the approach in [78] is centered on identifying patterns in
the relationships between a known metric and the corresponding holographic entanglement entropy, effectively associating the constructed network with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula itself.
In our study, we initially utilized holographic entanglement entropy as input data for
our machine learning approach. This enabled us to accurately derive the bulk metrics for
both the Gubser-Rocha model and holographic superconductor models, which are prominent
holographic models of strongly coupled quantum systems characterized by a non-trivial
metric where h(z) ̸= 1: see figure 7 for the case of Gubser-Rocha model and figure 10 for
the superconductor model.
Additionally, our machine learning approach successfully incorporates entanglement
entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional
systems [99], and identifies the corresponding emergent bulk metric: see figure 12. Remarkably,
we observed that the emergent metric exhibits a resemblance to that of the Gubser-Rocha
model, where h(z) increases monotonically towards the horizon and f (z) reveals an anomalous
peak structure. This resemblance may be attributed to the fact that both models can describe
metallic phases, with the Gubser-Rocha model featuring linear-temperature resistivity and
the fermionic tight-binding chain exhibiting gapless excitations, where electrons can move
freely without encountering an energy gap.
Our successful results indicate that, on a practical level, our algorithm enhances the
efficiency of modeling the emergent metric from the entanglement structure of quantum many-

body systems. Furthermore, it signifies the successful completion of the bulk reconstruction
program, thereby advancing our understanding of holographic emergent gravity derived
from quantum entanglement.
It is noteworthy that much of the work on metric reconstruction, including our own, has
been motivated by the idea that spacetime is constructed through entanglement entropy.
However, it has been argued that “entanglement is not enough” to fully encode spacetime [187],
as the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the gravity context only probes the exterior metrics of black
holes. To gain insight into the full geometry even interior of a black hole, it has been proposed
that quantum computational complexity plays a crucial role. Indeed, based on various
holographic complexity proposals, such as complexity=volume [187, 188], complexity=volume
2.0 [189], and complexity=anything [190], the internal metrics of black holes have been
successfully reconstructed without employing machine learning techniques [56, 57].
In general, understanding the internal structure of a black hole poses a captivating and
fundamental challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. A recent and actively studied
direction in holography involves examining the structure and dynamics of the black hole
interior, particularly near the singularity where spacetime curvature becomes infinitely intense.
For instance, pioneering work on the Kasner singularity in holography can be found in [191].
As such, exploring and reconstructing the interior geometry of a black hole using machine
learning holographic techniques is highly significant, not only from the perspective of quantum
information theory via complexity but also for advancing the study of quantum gravity. We
intend to pursue this line of research in future studies and plan to address it in subsequent
investigations.

Entanglement entropy in the small subsystem size limit

In this section, we derive the holographic entanglement entropy (2.5) in the limit of small
subsystem size ℓ ≪ 1 (or small z∗ ). In this regime, the Ryu-Takayanagi surface is located
near the AdS boundary. Consequently, we consider the asymptotic AdS behavior of the
metric (2.1) as follows
f (z) = 1 + f ′ (0) z + · · · ,

h(z) = 1 + h′ (0) z + · · · ,

(A.1)

which holds for small ℓ. Similarly, utilizing (A.1) and (A.2), we can analytically compute
the holographic entanglement entropy (2.5) in the small ℓ limit as

where · · · denotes the O(ℓ) correction, which can be obtained by considering the z 2 order in

B

The procedure of training the network and the error estimation

In this section, we discuss the training procedure employed in our machine learning approach,
along with the error estimation.
In figure 13(a)-(c), we illustrate the representative results for the holographic models,
namely, the linear-axion model, the Gubser-Rocha model, and the holographic superconductor
model, using Data 2 from (3.21) and T /Tc = 0.75. The figure clearly demonstrates that
throughout the training process, the metric functions f (z) and h(z) gradually converge
towards the values (indicated by blue lines) obtained from the holographic models: the gray
lines represent the metric components initialized (i.e., before training) with random values
on weights W ij and biases bi of the deep neural networks. Additionally, in figure 13(d), we
depict the training procedure for the tight-binding chain model.
In the figure, we also present both the untrained and trained entanglement entropy data
for all the models under consideration. It is evident that the entanglement entropy calculated
with the trained metrics, represented by blue dots, closely aligns with the input entanglement
entropy data (depicted by the black solid line).
We also evaluate the loss function (4.11) estimated from our machine learning method.
For all datasets, we find that the values of both the first and second terms in (4.11) consistently
remain within the range of 10−4 to 10−2 after training: for instance, see figure 14 for the
Gubser-Rocha model. It is expected that as these numerical values decrease further, for

in the blue data in figure 10) will correspondingly diminish.
