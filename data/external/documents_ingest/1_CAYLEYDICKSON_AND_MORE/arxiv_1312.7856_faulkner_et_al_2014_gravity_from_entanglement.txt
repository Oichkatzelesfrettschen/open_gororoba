                                         Abstract:

                                         Entanglement entropy obeys a ‘first law’, an exact quantum generalization of the ordinary
                                         first law of thermodynamics. In any CFT with a semiclassical holographic dual, this first
                                         law has an interpretation in the dual gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes
                                         dual to CFT states. For small perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that
                                         the set of such constraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly equivalent
                                         to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational equations of motion,
                                         linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement entropy computed by the Ryu-
                                         Takayanagi formula S = A/(4GN ), we obtain the linearized Einstein equations. For theories
                                         in which the vacuum entanglement entropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald
                                         functionals, we obtain the linearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories.
                                         Using the first law, we also derive the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor, given the
                                         holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a simple alternative to
                                         holographic renormalization for computing the stress tensor expectation value in arbitrary
                                         higher derivative gravitational theories.

1       Introduction

According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, spacetime and gravitational physics in AdS
emerge from the dynamics of certain strongly-coupled conformal field theories with a large
number of degrees of freedom. A central question is to understand why and how this hap-
pens. In recent work, it has been suggested that the physics of quantum entanglement plays
an essential role, e.g. [1–5]. This was motivated in part by the importance of quantum en-
tanglement for understanding quantum phases of matter in condensed matter systems [6].
Ryu and Takayanagi have proposed [1, 2] that entanglement entropy, one measure of en-
tanglement between subsets of degrees of freedom in general quantum systems, provides a
direct window into the emergent spacetime geometry, giving the areas of certain extremal
surfaces. This provides a quantitative connection between CFT entanglement and the dual
spacetime geometry. Recently, this connection has been utilized to understand the emergence
of spacetime dynamics (i.e. gravity) from the CFT physics [7]. Making use of a ‘first law’
for entanglement entropy derived in [8], it was shown [7] that in any holographic theory for
which the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription computes the entanglement entropy of the boundary
CFT, spacetimes dual to small perturbations of the CFT vacuum state must satisfy Einstein’s
equations linearized around pure AdS spacetime.
     In this paper, we provide further insight into the results of [7, 8] and extend them to
general holographic CFTs, for which the classical bulk equations may include terms at higher
order in the curvatures or derivatives. We show further that the first law for entanglement
entropy in the CFT can be understood as the microscopic origin of a particular case of the
first law of black hole thermodynamics, applied to AdS-Rindler horizons. We begin with a
brief review of some essential background before summarizing our main results.

The ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy
The crucial piece of CFT physics giving rise to linearized gravitational equations in the dual
theory is a ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy,
                                             δSA = δhHA i                                            (1.1)
equating the first order variation in the entanglement entropy for a spatial region A with
the first order variation in the expectation value of HA , the modular (or entanglement)
Hamiltonian. The latter operator is defined as the logarithm of the unperturbed state, i.e.
ρA ≃ e−HA — see section 2.1 for further details. The first law was derived in [8]1 as a special
case of a more general result for finite perturbations
                                            ∆SA ≤ ∆hHA i                                             (1.2)
obtained using the positivity of ‘relative entropy’.2 A more direct demonstration of (1.1) is
reviewed in section 2.1 below.
    1
   Related observations had been made independently using various holographic calculations, e.g. [9].
    2
   Relative entropy can be viewed as a statistical measure of the distance between two states (i.e. density
matrices) in the same Hilbert space — e.g. see [10, 11] for reviews.




                                                  –2–
    In general, the modular Hamiltonian HA is a complicated object that cannot be expressed
as an integral of local operators. However, starting from the vacuum state of a CFT in flat
space and taking A to be a ball-shaped spatial region of radius R centered at x0 , denoted
B(R, x0 ), the modular Hamiltonian is given by a simple integral [12]

                                                R2 − |~x − ~x0 |2
                                    Z
                          HB = 2π        dd−1 x                   Ttt ,               (1.3)
                                     B(R,x0 )         2R

of the energy density over the interior of the sphere (weighted by a certain spatial profile).
Thus, given any perturbation to the CFT vacuum we have for any ball-shaped region

                                               R2 − |~x − ~x0 |2
                                  Z
                       δSB = 2π         dd−1 x                   δhTtt i ,              (1.4)
                                   B(R,x0 )         2R

where HB and SB denote the modular Hamiltonian and the entanglement entropy for a ball,
respectively.

The holographic interpretation
For conformal field theories with a gravity dual, the first law for ball-shaped regions can be
translated into a geometrical constraint obeyed by any spacetime dual to a small perturbation
of the CFT vacuum. To understand this, we first recall the holographic interpretation of
entanglement entropy and energy density in the general case (see section 2.3 for more details).
     As shown by [12] in deriving (1.3), the vacuum entanglement entropy of a CFT for a
ball-shaped region in flat space can be reinterpreted as the thermal entropy of the CFT on
a hyperbolic cylinder at temperature set by the hyperbolic space curvature scale, by relating
the two backgrounds with a conformal mapping. For a holographic CFT, the latter thermal
entropy may then be calculated as the horizon entropy of the “black hole” dual to this thermal
state on hyperbolic space. In this case, the black hole is simply a Rindler wedge (which we
call the AdS-Rindler patch) of the original pure AdS space, as shown in figure 2. If the
gravitational theory in the bulk is Einstein gravity, then the horizon entropy is given by
the usual Bekenstein-Hawking formula, SBH = A/(4GN ), and this construction [12] provides a
derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription [1] for a spherical entangling surface.3 However,
we note that the same analysis applies for any classical and covariant gravity theory in the
bulk, in which case the horizon entropy is given by Wald’s formula [14–16]
                                        Z       √      δL
                           SWald = −2π      dn σ h      ab
                                                              nab ncd ,                   (1.5)
                                          H          δR    cd

where L denotes the gravitational Lagrangian and nab is the binormal to the horizon H.
     To summarize, in general holographic theories, entanglement entropy in the vacuum state
for a ball-shaped region B is computed by the Wald functional applied to the horizon of the
  3
    Recently, this approach was extended to a general argument for the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for
arbitrary entangling surfaces in time-independent (and some special time-dependent) backgrounds [13].




                                                –3–
AdS-Rindler patch associated with B. We will argue in section 2.3 that this should remain
true for perturbations to the vacuum state, so the left side of (1.4) computes the change in
entropy of the AdS-Rindler horizon under a small variation of the CFT state. Meanwhile, the
expectation value of the stress tensor is related to the asymptotic behaviour of the metric,
so the right side of (1.4) may be expressed as an integral involving the asymptotic metric
over a ball-shaped region of the boundary. In section 2.3, we show that this integral may
be interpreted as the variation in energy of the AdS-Rindler spacetime. Thus, the gravity
version of the entanglement first law (1.4) may be interpreted as a first law for AdS-Rindler
spacetimes. At a technical level, this represents a non-local constraint on the spacetime fields,
equating an integral involving the asymptotic metric perturbation over a boundary surface
to an integral involving the bulk metric perturbation (and possibly matter fields) over a bulk
surface.

Main results
Our first main result, presented in section 3, is that this first law for AdS-Rindler spacetimes,
i.e. the gravitational version of (1.4), is a special case of a first law proved by Iyer and
Wald for stationary spacetimes with bifurcate Killing horizons (i.e. at finite temperature) in
general classical theories of gravity. According to Iyer and Wald, for any perturbation of a
stationary background that satisfies the linearized equations of motion following from some
Lagrangian, the first law holds provided we define horizon entropy using the Wald functional
(1.5) associated with this Lagrangian. Thus, the CFT result (1.4) can be seen as an exact
quantum version of the Iyer-Wald first law, at least for the case of AdS-Rindler horizons.
     Our second result, presented in sections 4 and 5, provides a converse to the theorem
of Iyer and Wald. In AdS space, we can associate an AdS-Rindler patch to any ball-shaped
spatial region on the boundary in any Lorentz frame, as in figure 2. An arbitrary perturbation
to the AdS metric can be understood as a perturbation to each of these Rindler patches. We
show that if the first law is satisfied for every AdS-Rindler patch, then the perturbation must
satisfy the linearized gravitational equations. Thus, the set of non-local constraints (one for
each ball-shaped region in each Lorentz frame) implied by (1.4) is equivalent to the set of
local gravitational equations.
     The result in the previous paragraph – that the first law for AdS-Rindler patches implies
the linearized gravitational equations – is completely independent of AdS/CFT and holds for
any classical theory of gravity in AdS. However, since for holographic CFTs this gravitational
first law is implied by the entanglement first law, we conclude that the linearized gravita-
tional equations for the dual spacetime can be derived from any holographic CFT, given the
entanglement functional. This extends the results of [7] to general holographic CFTs.
     As a further application of the entanglement first law, we point out (see section 4.1)
that eq. (1.1), applied to infinitesimal balls, can be used to deduce the ‘holographic stress
tensor,’ i.e. the gravitational quantity that computes the expectation value of the CFT
stress tensor, given the holographic prescription for computing entanglement entropy. This
provides a simple alternative approach to the usual holographic renormalization procedure,




                                             –4–
as we illustrate with examples in section 6. Finally, we show that eq. (1.1) also provides
information about the operators in the boundary theory corresponding to additional degrees
of freedom that can be associated with the metric in the context of higher derivative gravity.
     We conclude in section 7 with a brief discussion of our results. In particular, we discuss
the relation of our work to the work of Jacobson [17], who obtained gravitational equations
by considering a gravitational first law applied to local Rindler horizons.

2       Background

In this section, we review some basic facts about entanglement entropy, modular Hamiltonians
and their holographic interpretation. In section 2.1, following [8], we review the first law-like
relation δSA = δhHA i satisfied by entanglement entropy, specializing to entanglement for
ball-shaped regions in a conformal field theory in section 2.2. In section 2.3, we review the
bulk interpretation of SA and hHA i in a holographic CFT.

2.1      The first law of entanglement entropy
For any state in a general quantum system, the state of a subsystem A is described by
a reduced density matrix ρA = trĀ ρtotal , where ρtotal is the density matrix describing the
global state of the full system and Ā is the complement of A. The entanglement of this
subsystem with the rest of the system may be quantified by the entanglement entropy SA ,
defined as the von Neumann entropy
                                          SA = − tr ρA log ρA                                          (2.1)
of the density matrix ρA .
     Since the reduced density matrix ρA is both hermitian and positive (semi)definite, it can
be expressed as
                                               e−HA
                                       ρA =            ,                                 (2.2)
                                             tr(e−HA )
where the Hermitian operator HA is known as the modular Hamiltonian. The denominator
is included on the right in the expression above to ensure that the reduced density matrix
has unit trace. Note the eq. (2.2) only defines HA up to an additive constant.
     Now, consider any infinitesimal variation to the state of the system. The first order
variation4 of the entanglement entropy (2.1) is given by
                           δSA = − tr(δρA log ρA ) − tr ρA ρ−1
                                                                  
                                                            A δρA
                                    = tr(δρA HA ) − tr(δρA ) .                                         (2.3)
Since the the trace of the reduced density matrix equals one by definition, we must have
tr(δρA ) = 0. Hence, the variation of the entanglement entropy obeys
                                             δSA = δhHA i ,                                            (2.4)
    4
    Here and below, the variations are defined by considering a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i such
that |Ψ(0)i = |0i. The variation δO of any quantity associated with |Ψi is then defined by δO = ∂λ O(λ)|λ=0 .

where HA is the modular Hamiltonian associated with the original unperturbed state.
    In cases where we start with a thermal state ρA = e−βH / tr(e−βH ), equation (2.4) gives
δhHi = T δSA , an exact quantum version of the first law of thermodynamics. Thus, (2.4)
represents a generalization of the first law of thermodynamics valid for arbitrary perturbations
to arbitrary (non-equilibrium) states.

2.2      The first law in conformal field theories
We now specialize to the case of local quantum field theories. Here, for any fixed Cauchy
surface, the field configurations on this time slice are representative of the Hilbert space of
the underlying quantum theory. We can then define a subsystem A by introducing a smooth
boundary or ‘entangling surface’, which divides the Cauchy surface into two separate regions,
A and Ā; the local fields in the region A define a subsystem.
     In general, the relation (2.4) is of limited use. For a general quantum field theory, a
general state, and a general region A, the modular Hamiltonian is not known and there is
no known practical method to compute it. Typically, HA is expected to be a complicated
non-local operator. However, there are a few situations where the modular Hamiltonian has
been established to have a simple form as the integral of a local operator, and in which it
generates a simple geometric flow.
     One example is when we consider a conformal field theory in its vacuum state, ρtotal =
|0ih0| in d-dimensional Minkowski space, and choose the region A to be a ball B(R, x0 ) of
radius R on a time slice t = t0 and centered at xi = xi0 .5 For this particular case, the modular

where Tµν is the stress tensor.
     To understand the origin of this expression, we recall that the causal development6 D of
B is related by a conformal transformation to a hyperbolic cylinder H = H d−1 × Rτ (time)
as shown in figure 1. As argued in [12], this transformation induces a map of CFT states that
takes the vacuum density matrix on B to the thermal density matrix ρH ∼ exp(−2πRHτ ) for
the CFT on hyperbolic space, where R is the curvature radius of the hyperbolic space and
Hτ is the CFT Hamiltonian generating time translations in H. The modular Hamiltonian for
ρH is then just 2πRHτ . Going back to D, it follows that the modular Hamiltonian for the
density matrix ρB is the Hamiltonian which generates the image under the inverse conformal
transformation of these time translations back in D, shown on the left in figure 1.
     To obtain the explicit expression (2.5), we define ζB to be the image of the Killing vector
2πR ∂τ under the inverse conformal transformation. This is a conformal Killing vector on the
original Minkowski space which can be written as a combination of a time translation Pt and
a certain special conformal transformation Kt ,
                                               iπ 2
                                        ζB =     (R Pt + Kt )                                     (2.6)

It is straightforward to check that ζB generates a flow which remains entirely in D, acting as
a null flow on ∂D and vanishing on the sphere ∂B(R, x0 ) and at the future and past tips of
D. The generator of this flow in the underlying CFT may be written covariantly as
                                           Z
                                     HB =     dΣµ Tµν ζBν
                                                                                         (2.8)
                                                 S

where dΣµ is the volume-form on the (d − 1)-dimensional surface S.       The integral may be
evaluated on any spatial surface S within the causal diamond D whose boundary is ∂B, but
for the particular choice S = B(R, x0 ), we recover (2.5). Note that the normalization of the
conformal Killing vector ζB was chosen in (2.6) to ensure that modular Hamiltonian HB and
the Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic cylinder Hτ are related by HB = 2πR U0 Hτ U0−1 where
U0 is the unitary transformation which implements the conformal mapping between the two
backgrounds [12].
     In summary, starting from the vacuum state of any conformal field theory and considering
a ball-shaped region B, the first law (2.4) simplifies to

                                             δSB = δEB ,                                          (2.9)

2.3     Interpretation of the first law in holographic CFTs
The first law (2.4) reviewed in the previous section is a general result. Hence for ball-shaped
regions in an arbitrary CFT in any number of spacetime dimensions, δSB = δEB with EB
defined in eq. (2.10). We will be interested in understanding this relation for holographic
CFT’s with a classical bulk dual, i.e. theories for which at least a subset of the states have
a dual interpretation as smooth, asymptotically AdS field configurations. In this case, the
vacuum state of the boundary CFT corresponds to pure anti-de Sitter space, while certain
small perturbations around the vacuum state should correspond to spacetime geometries that
are small perturbations around empty AdS.7 In holographic theories, both SB and EB should
match with observables on the gravity side, so δSB = δEB will translate into a constraint
   grav      grav
δSB     = δEB     that must be satisfied for any spacetime dual to a small perturbation of the
vacuum AdS spacetime.

2.3.1    Holographic interpretation of the entanglement entropy
The holographic prescription for computing the entanglement entropy is not known in general,
but in the known cases (e.g., [1, 13, 20–22]), it is given by extremizing a certain functional
of the bulk metric over codimension-two bulk surfaces whose boundary coincides with ∂A in
the boundary CFT. However, here we are only interested in the holographic entanglement
entropy for a ball-shaped region B in the CFT when the total state is the vacuum or a small
perturbation thereof. This particular case is well-understood due to the observation of [12],
reviewed in the previous section, that the vacuum density matrix for B maps by a conformal
transformation to a thermal state of the CFT on hyperbolic space.
      Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, the thermal state of the CFT on hyperbolic space
                       1
at temperature T = 2πR    is dual to a hyperbolic ‘black hole’ spacetime at this temperature,
i.e., AdS-Rindler space, with metric
                           ρ2 − ℓ2 2       ℓ2 dρ2
                     ds2 = −       dτ  +           + ρ2 (du2 + sinh2 u dΩ2d−2 ) .     (2.11)
                             R2           ρ2 − ℓ 2
The entanglement entropy for the region B equals the thermal entropy of the hyperbolic
space CFT, which can be interpreted as the entropy of this ‘black hole.’ In an arbitrary
theory of gravity, black hole entropy is computed by evaluating the Wald functional (1.5) on
the horizon. In terms of the Poincaré coordinates on AdS space

                                ds2 = 2 dz 2 + ηµν dxµ dxν ,

    More precisely, the states that we will consider have energy of order ε cT , where cT is the central charge of
the boundary CFT (e.g. see [19]) which provides a measure of the number of degrees of freedom in the CFT.
Since we consider classical gravity in the bulk, cT → ∞; we take ε << 1 in order for the perturbation to be
classical, but small. The first law relation also holds for quantum states in the bulk, whose CFT energy does
not scale with cT , but we will not consider them in this article.

the hyperbolic ‘black hole’ associated with the ball B(R, x0 ) is simply the wedge shown in
figure 2, the intersection of the causal past and the casual future of the region D on the
boundary. The coordinate transformation between the two metrics is described in [12]. The
horizon slice approached with ρ → ℓ and τ fixed in the black hole metric (2.11) corresponds
to the hemisphere B̃ = {t = t0 , (xi − xi0 )2 + z 2 = R2 } in Poincaré coordinates. By design
[12], this is also the extremal surface in AdS bulk with boundary ∂B. Thus, the entanglement
entropy SB for the vacuum state can be calculated gravitationally by evaluating the Wald
functional (1.5) on the surface B̃.
     If we consider a perturbation of the original vacuum state, the perturbation of the en-
tanglement entropy must equal the perturbation of the thermal entropy of the CFT on the
hyperbolic cylinder. Assuming that this equals the perturbation to the black hole entropy,
                             grav      W ald . In general, the entanglement entropy functional is
we must also have that δSB        = δSB
known to differ from the Wald functional [21, 23] by terms quadratic in the extrinsic curvature
of the extremal bulk surface. These terms are important for arbitrarily-shaped entangling
surfaces or general states in the CFT. However, for the special case of a spherical entangling
surface considered here and a CFT in the vacuum, the extremal surface B̃ in the bulk is the
bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon defining the boundary of the AdS-Rindler patch

and the extrinsic curvatures of this surface vanish. Therefore, δSB     and δSB

     To summarize, the holographic dictionary implies that SB        for a small perturbation
around AdS is the Wald functional of the perturbed metric evaluated on B̃.

2.3.2    Holographic interpretation of the modular energy EB
In the CFT, the expression (2.10) defines EB in terms of the expectation value of the field
theory stress energy tensor. On the gravity side, the latter is computed by the “holographic
                 grav
stress tensor” Tµν    , a quantity constructed locally from the asymptotic metric.9 For a general
          grav
theory, Tµν can be obtained via a systematic procedure known as holographic renormal-
                                                                                grav
ization [24–26]. Alternatively, as we show in sections 4.1 and 6 below, Tµν          can be derived
using the holographic entanglement entropy function and the relation δSB = δEB .
     The gravitational version of EB is simply obtained by replacing the stress tensor expec-
tation value in (2.8) or (2.10) with the holographic stress tensor

           grav
giving EB        as an integral of a local functional of the asymptotic metric over the region
B(R, x0 ) at the AdS boundary.
     As discussed above, EB is the conserved quantity associated with the boundary conformal
Killing vector ζB . An alternate definition [16] of the gravitational quantity associated with this
is as the canonical conserved charge associated to translations along a bulk asymptotic Killing
vector ξB that asymptotically agrees with ζB , limz→0 ξB = ζB . We review this definition
  grav
EB     [ξB ] in section 5 below and show in section 5.3 that it agrees with (2.13) (at least for the
                                                                                           grav
perturbations we are considering). Thus, for perturbations to the vacuum state, EB               can
be interpreted as the perturbation to the energy of the AdS-Rindler patch associated with
the region B, as in figure 2.
     Note that under the conformal map from D to H, the conserved charge associated to ζB
maps to (2πR times) the energy associated to τ translations, computed using either formalism.

2.3.3    Summary
In summary, for states of a holographic CFT with a classical gravity dual description, the
CFT relation δSB = δEB translates to a statement that the integral of the Wald functional
over the bulk surface B̃ must equal the integral of the energy functional, as given in (2.13),
   8
      Further, note that in the perturbed spacetime, the extremal surface will not necessarily correspond to
the bifurcation surface of the AdS-Rindler horizon. However, since B̃ is an extremal surface for the Wald
functional, changes in the Wald functional due to variations in the surface come in only at second order in
the metric perturbation. To calculate the Wald functional at leading order in the metric perturbation, we
                                 W ald
therefore need only evaluate δSB       on B̃, the bifurcation surface of the unperturbed AdS-Rindler horizon.
    9
      Other fields in the bulk may also contribute to the holographic stress tensor (e.g. a bilinear of gauge
fields when d = 2), but their contributions are always nonlinear in the fields and vanish at the linearized order
around pure AdS that we are considering.

over the boundary surface B. This provides one nonlocal constraint on the metric for each
ball B in each Lorentz frame. The constraints may be interpreted as the statement that the
perturbation to the entropy of the AdS-Rindler patch associated with the region B equals
the perturbation to the energy.

3   The holographic first law of entanglement from the first law of black hole
    thermodynamics

In holographic CFTs, whenever the gravitational observables corresponding to SB and EB
are known, the first law of entanglement entropy (2.4) applied to a ball, i.e. δSB = δEB ,
                                                                                                   grav
gives a prediction for the equivalence of two corresponding gravitational quantities, δSB
         grav
and δEB       , in any spacetime dual to a small perturbation of the CFT vacuum state. This
prediction must hold assuming the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of our holo-
graphic interpretation of EB and SB . As we will see in the next section, the power of this
equivalence arises because in fact, we have an infinite number of predictions since δSB = δEB
can be applied for any ball-shaped region in any Lorentz frame in the boundary geometry. For
the case of Einstein gravity, where entanglement entropy is calculated by the Ryu-Takayanagi
                                        grav        grav
proposal [1, 2], the equivalence of δSB      and δEB     was confirmed in [8], and by a different
method in [7].
                                             grav      grav
     In this section, we will verify that δSB     = δEB     follows from the equations of motion
in a general theory of gravity. The crucial observation, described in the previous section, is
that this gravitational relation can be interpreted as a statement of the equivalence of energy
and entropy for perturbations of AdS-Rindler space. This equivalence follows directly from
the generalized first law of black hole thermodynamics proved by Iyer and Wald [27].
     The Iyer-Wald theorem states that for a stationary spacetime with a bifurcate Killing
                                                                                            κ
horizon generated by a Killing vector ξ, arbitrary on-shell perturbations satisfy 2π          δSWald =
δE[ξ]. Here SWald is the Wald entropy defined in the introduction, E[ξ] is a canonical energy
associated to the Killing vector ξ and κ is the surface gravity: ξ a ∇a ξ b = κ ξ b on the horizon.
     The key observation that connects this to our holographic version of the entanglement
first law is that the Iyer-Wald theorem applies to AdS-Rindler horizons. It is straightforward
to check that the vector
                 2π                               π
        ξB = − (t − t0 )[z∂z + (xi − xi0 )∂i ] + [R2 − z 2 − (t − t0 )2 − (~x − x~0 )2 ] ∂t      (3.1)
                  R                               R
is an exact Killing vector of the standard Poincaré metric (2.12), which vanishes on B̃(R, ~x0 ).
This vector is in fact proportional to ∂τ in the AdS-Rindler coordinates (2.11). Thus, the
hemisphere B̃ is the bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon for ξB and the region Σ(R, ~x0 )
enclosed by B̃ and B is a spacelike slice that plays the role of the black hole exterior. The
Iyer-Wald theorem applies, and the Killing vector has been normalized such that κ = 2π, so
δSBW ald = δE [ξ ].
             B B
     The definition of modular energy entering the above equality is the Iyer-Wald one; we
                                                       grav
show in section 5.3 that this quantity agrees with δEB      defined in terms of the holographic

stress tensor. Finally, we argued in the previous section that δSB    = δSB
                   grav       grav
it follows that δSB     = δEB . This generalizes the result of [8] to an arbitrary higher-
derivative theory of gravity.

4     Linearized gravity from the holographic first law

In the previous section, making use of the theorem of Iyer and Wald [27], we argued that in
a general theory of gravity, any perturbation to AdS satisfying the linearized gravitational
                                                                                      grav      grav
equations will obey the holographic version of the entanglement first law, i.e. δSB        = δEB     .
In this section, we will demonstrate a converse statement: any asymptotically AdS spacetime
              grav        grav
for which δSB      = δEB       for all balls B in all Lorentz frames must satisfy the linearized
gravitational equations and have the appropriate boundary conditions at the asymptotic

     We begin in section 4.1 by showing that δSB           = δEB       applied to infinitesimal ball-
shaped regions allows us to determine the holographic stress tensor in a general theory of
gravity and to constrain the asymptotic behavior of the metric. In section 4.3, we explain
        grav       grav
how δSB       = δEB     , when applied to balls of arbitrary radius and centered at arbitrary
locations in arbitrary Lorentz frames, can be used to deduce the linearized gravitational
equations of motion, generalizing the results of [7]. Since we have already argued in section 3
                                            grav      grav
that these equations of motion imply δSB         = δEB     , it follows that the holographic version
of the entanglement first law is equivalent to the linearized gravitational equations in general
theories of gravity.
     In situations where the metric perturbation is the only field turned on in the bulk, the
asymptotic behavior of the metric together with the linearized equations of motion determine
the metric perturbation everywhere. In this case, knowledge of the entanglement functional
allows us to recover the complete mapping from states to dual spacetimes at the linearized
level.

4.1    The holographic stress tensor from the holographic entanglement functional
To begin, we show that given the holographic prescription for computing entanglement en-
tropy, the equation δSB = δEB applied to ball-shaped regions of vanishing size can be used
to determine the relation between the expectation value of the field theory stress tensor and
the asymptotic metric in the dual spacetime.
    Recall the result (2.10),

                                               R2 − |~x − ~x0 |2
                                   Z
                   δEB(R,x0 ) = 2π      dd−1 x                   δhTtt (t0 , ~x)i .      (4.1)
                                    B(R,x0 )        2R

In the limit of a very small spherical region, i.e. R → 0, the expectation value of the stress
tensor is approximately constant throughout the ball B(R, x0 ). Thus, the leading contribution
to δEB is obtained by replacing δhTtt (t0 , ~x)i with its central value δhTtt (t0 , ~x0 )i ≡ δhTtt (x0 )i,

The meaning of this equation is the following: SB is a bulk Wald functional that depends
on a small metric perturbation hab , as well as the radius R and center x0 of the entangling
surface. The above equation tells us that SB [h]/Rd cannot be arbitrary, but rather it must
have a finite limit as R → 0.

where δSB(R,x0 ) is the variation of the entanglement entropy for a ball of radius R, centered
at x0 on a spatial slice in the frame of reference of an observer moving with the d-velocity
uµ . From the result (4.4), it is clear that given the bulk prescription for calculating δSB , this
formula provides us the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor.

Example: theories with entropy equal to area
As an example, consider a d-dimensional field theory for which the entanglement entropy is
computed by the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription [1] in the dual (d + 1)-dimensional bulk

                                             grav       AB̃

                                                        4GN
We consider a small metric perturbation hab of the AdS metric (2.12), chosen to be in radial
gauge,
                                     hzµ = hzz = 0 .                                   (4.6)
The change in the entanglement entropy of the ball due to this bulk perturbation is

In the limit R → 0, we can replace hij (z, xµ ) by hij (z, xµ0 ) under the integral sign. To compute
the R-scaling of the entropy and check whether it can satisfy (4.3), it is useful to define the
rescaled variables

where hµν does not scale with R. Performing the xi integral and substituting into (4.3), we
find

                                 δhTtt i =        h i.                               (4.10)
                                           16πGN
In order to generalize this result to an arbitrary Lorentz frame as in (4.4), it is useful to
                   (d)       (d)λ
rewrite h(d)i i = h00 − η00 hλ . Passing to an arbitrary frame and equating the coefficients
of uµ uν , we find

                                         16πGN µν
Now tracelessness and conservation of the CFT stress tensor imply that this leading pertur-
bation of the bulk metric must satisfy

                                      h(d)µ
                                       µ    =0,        ∂µ h(d)µν = 0 .                                 (4.12)

These equations correspond to the initial value constraints on the z = 0 surface in Einstein
gravity. Applying the tracelessness condition allows the stress tensor to be simplified to

Of course, this expression is the usual result for the linearized holographic stress tensor in
Einstein gravity in AdSd+1 [24, 25].
    In section 5.3 we show, using a scaling argument, that even in the presence of higher

depends on the higher curvature couplings10 — see also section 6.

4.2    The linearized Fefferman-Graham expansion
We have just shown how the R → 0 limit of the first law relation constrains the leading
behavior of the metric for small z and determines the holographic stress tensor. By equating
                                                grav         grav
terms at higher orders in the expansion of δSB(R,x   0)
                                                        = δEB(R,x 0)
                                                                     in powers of R, we can
obtain additional constraints on the metric. At each higher order in R, the equations involve
successively higher terms in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the metric (i.e. the expansion
in powers of z). In [7], it was shown, for theories with holographic entanglement entropy
computed by area, that these constraints completely determine the linearized metric to all
orders in the Fefferman-Graham expansion. At the linearized level, this gives the complete
  10                                                                (d)
    This result can understood using conformal invariance, since hµν is the only spin-2 tensor that we can
write down with scaling dimension d under z → λz. Here we are assuming that there are no scalar fields,
coupled linearly to curvature, with mass tuned so that the conformal dimension of the dual operators is ∆ = d,
and similarly for other matter fields.

metric perturbation everywhere in the bulk, and the result is precisely the solution to the
linearized Einstein’s equations with boundary behavior governed by the holographic stress
tensor.
     While we could apply the same approach to more general theories of gravity, we will
instead take another route that leads to the full equations of motion without having to
assume a series expansion for the quantities in the first law relation.

4.3   Linearized equations from the holographic entanglement functional
In this section, we will show that knowledge of the holographic entanglement functional allows
us to deduce the linearized gravitational equations for the entire dual spacetime, by making
use of the relation δSB = δEB for ball shaped regions B(R, x0 ) of arbitrary radius R and
center position xµ0 in arbitrary Lorentz frames.
     Figure 3 shows the unperturbed bulk AdS spacetime, with the region B(R, x0 ) on the
boundary, together with the bulk extremal surface B̃(R, x0 ) with the same boundary as B
and the spatial region Σ on a constant time slice bounded by these two surfaces. Using
the definition (2.13) and the result (4.4) for the holographic stress tensor, we can write the
             grav
quantity δEB      as an integral over the corresponding region B(R, x0 ) on the boundary of the
dual spacetime of some local quantity, a (d − 1)-form, that is constructed from the asymptotic
limit of the metric perturbation hab .
     In a similar way, the holographic entanglement functional gives us a prescription for
writing the entanglement entropy δSB as an integral over the extremal surface B̃(R, x0 ) in
the bulk (shown in figure 2). Again, the form that we integrate is locally constructed from
                                                                             grav      grav
the metric perturbation hab (and possibly matter fields). The relation δSB         = δEB    then
                                                                                  grav       grav
places a constraint on the perturbation: the two integrals corresponding to δEB and δSB

must be equal. This must be true for any R and xµ0 , in any Lorentz frame. We will show that
this infinite set of nonlocal integral equations together implies the local differential equations
   g                  g
δEab  = 0, where δEab    are the linearized gravitational equations of motion.

Turning the nonlocal constraint into a local equation
To convert the nonlocal integral equations into a local equation, the strategy is to make use
of the machinery used by Iyer and Wald to derive the first law from the equations of motion.
The Iyer-Wald formalism is reviewed in detail in the next section, but for now we just need
one fact: the crucial step in the derivation is the construction of a (d− 1)-form χ that satisfies
                                Z                    Z

and for which dχ = 0 on shell (i.e. when the gravitational equations of motion are satisfied).
                                                R
The first law follows immediately by writing Σ dχ = 0 and applying Stokes theorem (i.e.
integrating by parts).
     To derive local equations from the gravitational first law, we will show that there exists
a form χ which satisfies the relations (4.14) off shell, and whose derivative is

(defined in eq. (5.3)), ξB is the Killing vector (3.1) that vanishes on B̃(R, x0 ), and δEab are
the linearized gravitational equations of motion. In addition, we will require that

                                                   dχ|∂M = 0                                   (4.16)

where ∂M is the AdS boundary, assuming the tracelessness and conservation of the holo-

graphic stress tensor.11 This ensures that the energy EB      does not depend on the surface
S on the boundary that we use to evaluate it, as long as ∂S = ∂B. Note that on Σ, only the
time components of ξBa and εb are non-vanishing, so only the tt component of the gravitational

equations appears on the right-hand side of eq. (4.15).
    The derivation of these statements in a general theory of gravity relies on the Iyer-Wald
formalism [27] and is deferred to section 5. Now we will show that the existence of the form

      This in turn follows from the conservation and tracelessness of the CFT stress tensor.

generally, demanding δSB       = δEB     in a frame of reference defined by a d-velocity vector uµ
                  g
implies uµ uν δEµν = 0, where the index µ = 0, . . . , d − 1 runs over the boundary coordinates.
Since this holds for any uµ , we have

                                            δEµν  =0.                                          (4.20)
These are all the components of the gravitational equations of motion along the boundary
directions.

     To obtain the remaining equations δEzµ       = 0 and δEzz    = 0, we appeal to the initial
value formulation of gravity, in a radial slicing where these are the constraint equations. This
formulation guarantees that if these constraints are satisfied at z = 0, and the other equations
(4.20) hold everywhere, then the constraints hold for all z.12 The vanishing of the constraints
at z = 0 follows from eq. (4.16) combined with eq. (4.15), or ultimately from the conservation
and tracelessness of the holographic stress tensor.
     In detail, we have using the Noether identity (discussed in appendix B) linearized about
the AdS background,
                                        ∇a (δE g )ab = 0 .                                (4.21)
                        g
Using the vanishing of Eµν , the general solution to (4.21) can be written as:

                                                                     1

for unfixed Cµ , Cz which are functions of the boundary coordinates. We simply need to show
that Cµ , Cz must vanish. This is achieved by the requirement (4.16) which (using eq. (4.15)
and (4.22)) gives:

                                z→0 (z ξB ) = −2πR (t−t0 ) which is related to the boundary
                                                             z . Since it is possible to construct
conformal Killing vector via: ∂µ (ζB )ν + ∂ν (ζB )µ = 2ηµν ζ̃B
χ for all possible boundary regions B and in all Lorentz frames, it follows that Cµ = Cz = 0.
    In summary, we can obtain the full set of linearized gravitational equations, if we can
show that a form χ exists, which satisfies eqs. (4.14), (4.15) and (4.16). We do this in section
5.

       In Einstein gravity, this follows from the Bianchi identity by a standard argument [28].

Example: linearized Einstein equations from S = A/4GN
In section 5, we will prove that χ exists in a general theory, but we first give the explicit
formula for Einstein gravity without introducing any additional formalism. Consider the case
of a holographic CFT for which the field theory entanglement entropy of a region A is equal
to one quarter the area of the bulk extremal-area surface with boundary ∂A. In this case,
writing the metric perturbation as hµν = z d−2 Hµν , we are looking for a form χ whose exterior
derivative, restricted to Σ, is proportional to the tt component of the Einstein equation, and
which satisfies

Here, we have used eqs. (2.10) and (4.13) to write an explicit expression for δEB               , making

of the Einstein equations δEab   = 0 are also satisfied by the argument above.14 Thus, for
theories where the Ryu-Takayanagi area formula computes entanglement entropies, the non-

local equations δSB    = δEB     are equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations.

    For the case of Einstein gravity, we have δEzz ∝ H µ and δEzµ ∝ ∂µ H ν − ∂ν H µ µ = 0 so the vanishing
of these expressions at z = 0 follows immediately from the tracelessness and conservation of the holographic
stress tensor, using (4.13).

5        Linearized equations in general theories of gravity

In this section, we review the formalism used by Iyer and Wald to prove a version of the first
law of black hole thermodynamics in general theories of gravity (section 5.1), and apply it in
section 5.2 to construct a form χ with the properties outlined in section 4.3. We also argue
in section 5.3 that the energy for a perturbed AdS-Rindler spacetime as defined by Iyer and
Wald is equivalent to the energy defined using the holographic stress tensor in eq. (2.10).

5.1       The covariant formalism for entropy and conserved charges
We begin by introducing notation and setting up the Iyer-Wald formalism [14, 16]. A helpful
general discussion motivating this formalism can be found in [29].

Basic definitions
Let L be any gravitational Lagrangian, viewed as a d + 1-form

                                                 L = Lε ,                                                 (5.1)

where L is constructed from the metric, curvature tensors, and their covariant derivatives.
Here, ε is the volume form15
                                       1
                               ε=           εa ···a dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxad+1 .                               (5.2)
                                    (d + 1)! 1 d+1

For later convenience, we also define:
            1                                               1
    εa =      εab ···b dxb2 ∧ · · · ∧ dxbd+1 ,   εab =            εabc3 ···cd+1 dxc3 ∧ · · · ∧ dxcd+1 .   (5.3)
            d! 2 d+1                                     (d − 1)!

Denoting the dynamical fields collectively by φ = {gµν , . . . }, the variation of L under a general
variation of the fields takes the form

                                          δL = Eφ δφ + dΘ(δφ)                                             (5.4)

where Eφ = 0 are the equations of motion for the theory, and Θ is called the symplectic
potential current.16 In the first term, a sum over fields φ with indices contracted appropriately
is implied.

Definition of Wald entropy from the Noether current
For a spacetime with a bifurcate Killing horizon associated to a Killing vector ξ, the Wald
entropy can be defined in terms of the Noether current associated with ξ, as we now review.
    15                                                                                             √
     Note that εa1 ···ad+1 is an antisymmetric tensor, and our sign convention is εzti1 ···id−1 = + −g .
  16
     This potential Θ, and similarly the Noether charge form Q below, have ambiguities related to boundary
terms in the Lagrangian and shifting by an exact form. Implicitly, these ambiguities, discussed in [15, 16],
have been fixed to simplify our formulae here but would not affect our arguments.




                                                  – 19 –
   Starting with an arbitrary vector field ξ, the variation of the Lagrangian under a diffeo-
morphism generated by ξ µ is
                                       δξ L = d(ξ · L)                                 (5.5)
where the dot denotes the usual inner product of ξ µ with the form L.17 Since this represents
a local symmetry of a Lagrangian field theory, Noether’s theorem guarantees that we can
associate to it a current J µ [ξ] that is conserved when the equations of motion are satisfied.
This Noether current (expressed as a d-form) is given by

                                                J[ξ] = Θ(δξ φ) − ξ · L .                                            (5.6)

Using eqs. (5.5) and (5.4), we can check that

                                                   dJ[ξ] = −Eφ δξ φ ,                                               (5.7)

so J is conserved on shell as promised.
    Because eq. (5.7) holds for all vector fields ξ, it follows [30] that we can find a (d− 1)-form
Q such that
                                  J[ξ] = dQ[ξ]        (on shell) .                             (5.8)
Recalling that the Noether charge associated with the diffeomorphism ξ is the integral of J
over a spacelike hypersurface Σ, we see that the existence of Q (called the Noether charge
form) allows us to express this charge as an integral over the boundary of Σ.
    As shown in [16], Q can be written as

                                Q[ξ] = Wc ξ c + Xcd ∇[c ξd] ,           Xcd = −ER
                                                                                abcd
                                                                                     εab ,                          (5.9)

where ERabcd is the ‘equation of motion’ for the Riemann tensor, derived as if it were an

independent field in the Lagrangian:

                               abcd       δL       ∂L            ∂L
                              ER    =           ≡        − ∇a1           + ··· .                                   (5.10)
                                         δRabcd   ∂Rabcd       ∂∇a1Rabcd

Eq. (5.8) only defines Q on shell. It is always possible to define Q off shell so that

                                                J[ξ] = dQ[ξ] + ξ a Ca ,                                            (5.11)

where Ca are the constraint equations on a fixed-time slice. That is,

       In a spacetime with a bifurcate Killing horizon, the Wald entropy (1.5) is now defined as
                                                 Z
                                      SWald = 2π     Xcd ncd ,                            (5.13)
                                                       H
where H is the bifurcation surface and ncd is the binormal to H. This definition also applies
to linearized excitations of a stationary background. It is related to the Noether charge as
follows. Let ξ be the Killing vector that generates the horizon and vanishes on H. In general,
∇[c ξd] = κ ncd on the horizon, where κ is the surface gravity. If we normalize ξ so that κ = 2π,
then the Wald entropy equals the Noether charge
                                                 Z
                                       SWald =      Q[ξ] .                                  (5.14)
                                                       H

On the stationary background, this agrees with (5.13) because ξ = 0 on the bifurcation surface.
It was argued in [14, 16] that eqs. (5.14) and (5.13) also agree for linearized excitations.

Definition of energy
For perturbations of the background spacetime, we can define an energy canonically associated
to a Killing vector ξ. Defining the symplectic current

                               ω (δ1 φ, δ2 φ) = δ2 Θ(δ1 φ) − δ1 Θ(δ2 φ) ,                         (5.15)

the Hamiltonian that generates translations along ξ µ is obtained by integrating ω over a
Cauchy surface C,                         Z
                                      δHW [ξ] =        ω (δφ, δξ φ) .                             (5.16)
                                                   C
This can be rewritten using

                                 δJ[ξ] = δΘ(δξ φ) − ξ · dΘ(δφ)                                    (5.17)
                                        = ω (δξ φ, δφ) + d(ξ · Θ(δφ))                             (5.18)

where we used the background equations of motion E φ = 0 and the formula for the Lie
derivative of a form,
                            δξ u ≡ Lξ u = ξ · du + d(ξ · u).                  (5.19)
Therefore using eqs. (5.11) and (5.18), we have
                                   Z         Z
                                       a
                       δHW [ξ] = δ ξ Ca +       (δQ[ξ] − ξ · Θ(δφ)) .                             (5.20)
                                        C           ∂C
Thus, H reduces to a boundary term when the equations of motion are satisfied. We define
the energy δE[ξ] for an arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily on-shell) perturbation of the background
spacetime as this contribution at the asymptotic boundary,18
                                         Z
                               δE[ξ] =       (δQ[ξ] − ξ · Θ(δφ)) .                         (5.21)
                                            ∂C
  18
    As discussed in [16], this definition can be extended to general spacetimes with the same asymptotic
                                                          R           R
behavior provided that there exists a form B such that δ ∂C ξ · B = ∂C ξ · Θ. In this case, we can define
       R
E[ξ] = ∂C (Q[ξ] − ξ · B) .

5.2   Definition of χ
Using the notation above, we can now define the form χ described in section 2.3 as

                                  χ = δQ[ξB ] − ξB · Θ(δφ) .                              (5.22)

As an example, the covariant formalism is applied to Einstein gravity plus a scalar field
in appendix C, leading to (4.26). In the rest of this section, we will demonstrate that χ
obeys the equations (4.14) and (4.15) that were needed to derive the equations of motion
         grav      grav
from δSB      = δEB     . That χ also obeys eq. (4.16) will be shown in the next section. We
emphasize that it is the existence of a form χ with these properties that guarantees that the
                                                       grav     grav
linearized equations of motion are equivalent to δSB        = δEB    . Thus, starting from only
the entropy functional SWald , it should be possible to recover the linearized equations even if
we do not know χ, L, Θ, or Q.
     The first property in eq. (4.14) follows directly from our definition (5.21) and the equiv-
alence of δE[ξB ] and δE grav , to be shown in the next section. The second property follows
from                                             Z            Z
                                grav
                             δSB = δSWald =         δQ[ξB ] =    χ.                       (5.23)
                                                  B̃            B̃
The first equality was discussed in section 2.3, the third equality follows from the definition
of χ since ξB vanishes on B̃, and the second equality was proved in [27], as discussed in the
previous section. The proof in [27] does not use the equations of motion, so it holds off shell
if we define the entropy as in eq. (5.13).
     To show eq. (4.15) note that for ξ a Killing vector of the background, eq. (5.18) implies
δJ[ξ] = d(ξ · Θ). Therefore
                                                  a          a   g b
                     dχ = δ(dQ[ξB ] − J[ξB ]) = −ξB δCa = −2ξB δEab ε                     (5.24)
          g
where Eab   is the equation of motion derived by varying the action with respect to g ab . Note
that fields vanishing on the background do not contribute to the first variation of Ca , which is
why our derivation always gives the gravitational equations rather than the some combination
of gravitational and matter equations.

5.3   Equivalence of the holographic and the canonical modular energy
For arbitrary perturbations to AdS, we now have two definitions of modular energy associated
to a given boundary region B: the “canonical” energy (5.21)

energy (2.10)                            Z

defined in terms of the holographic stress tensor (4.13).
     In order to complete our story, we must show that these two definitions of energy agree,
without assuming the equations of motion. This is not to say that the formulae agree for
arbitrary hµν – they do not. However, equivalence follows from the restrictions on the asymp-
                             grav        grav
totic metric implied by δSB       = δE(2)     . Note that the purely gravitational result of this
                                                                           grav      grav
paper – that the linearized equations of motion are equivalent to δSB           = δE(1)   – does
not require the results of this subsection; it is needed only to map the CFT problem to the
gravity problem.
     Consistency of the AdS/CFT dictionary requires the two definitions to agree, since both
should equal the CFT energy. This is confirmed for Einstein gravity in [31, 32], and rather
generally in [33], but these discussions rely on the equations of motion. Here we will demon-
strate the equivalence explicitly, at the linearized level, in a way that makes clear that we do
not need to start from the equations of motion. For simplicity, we assume in this calculation
that matter fields are not coupled to curvature, so only the metric appears in the linearized
energy.
     As we discussed in section 4.1 and will show in more detail in section 6, metric perturba-
tions for which the first law is satisfied at leading order in the R expansion behave near the
boundary as
                                                    (d)
                                       hµν = z d−2 hµν  + ...                              (5.27)
                                                                            grav
where the dots indicate terms at higher order in z. Other fall-offs, with δSB    = 0, are also
                                                                                       (d)

On the other hand, if we plug in the asymptotic expansion (5.27) into eq. (5.25), we find

for some coefficient C1 , as shown in appendix D. One should in principle be able to verify that
C1 = C2 by an explicit computation. However, since this can be a bit tedious in an arbitrary
higher derivative gravity theory, we present below a slightly indirect but simpler argument
that the two constants must be the same.
     To show that the coefficients C1 and C2 are equal, we use the fact that, according to our
definition, the entanglement first law is

As R → 0, the middle term in this equation is proportional to (C1 − C2 )Rd . On the other

hand, the term on the right-hand side starts at O(Rd+2 ), because hµν satisfies the linearized
equations of motion at leading order, as can be explicitly checked. Thus

for these modes.
     As we discuss in section 6.3, the other fall-offs allowed by first law are those for which
   grav
δSB     = 0 as R → 0. These behave near the boundary as

for particular values of ∆ > d − 2, given in eq. (6.37). These modes do not appear in the
                                                      grav                           grav
holographic stress tensor, so do not contribute to δE(2)   . Their contribution to δE(1)  is
proportional to z ∆−d as z → 0, and thus vanishes if ∆ > d. This means that our entire
analysis applies to modes with ∆ > d, so the linearized equations of motion hold everywhere.
                                                                              grav
Furthermore, since ∆ depends on the parameters in the Lagrangian, and δE(1)        must also
depend smoothly on these parameters, this conclusion also applies to modes with ∆ < d.
Alternatively, it can be checked explicitly that such modes obey the leading equations of
motion near the boundary (there is a single term to check because ∆ > d − 2) so eq. (5.32)
           grav      grav
implies δE(1)   = δE(2)   .
    Applying this discussion in an arbitrary frame, we have now established that, at the
boundary, χ is equal to the conserved current that appears in the modular energy:

                                    χ|∂M = dΣµ Tµν
                                                grav ν

Conservation and traceless of the CFT stress tensor therefore imply dχ|∂M = 0, completing
the derivation in section 4.

6   Application: the holographic dictionary in higher curvature gravity

In section 4.1, we have argued that in the limit R → 0, the entanglement first law, together
with the holographic entanglement functional, yields the holographic dictionary for the stress
tensor. As a concrete and non-trivial application of this observation, in this section we derive
the holographic dictionary for the case when the entanglement entropy is given by a Wald
functional that is polynomial in the Riemann tensor — in other words, for a higher derivative
gravity theory whose action is constructed from arbitrary powers of the Riemann tensor, but
no derivatives thereof. The analysis including derivatives of the Riemann tensor is similar —
and straightforward in any particular example — but we leave it to future work. As we will

show, in this case the entanglement first law allows one to derive holographic dictionary not
only for the stress tensor, but also for the other operators that couple to the metric in the
context of higher derivative gravity.
     The usual procedure for finding the holographic dictionary for an arbitrary gravitational
theory in AdS is holographic renormalization [24–26]. This technique provides full information
about the holographic dictionary, allowing both arbitrary sources and expectation values. One
can thus compute, in principle at least, any desired correlator of the stress tensor and the
other operators that couple to classical fields in the bulk. Nevertheless, computations that use
this method can become extremely tedious in the context of higher derivative gravity. The
reason is that a necessary first step in holographic renormalization is to render the variational
principle at the spacetime boundary well-defined, and this can be rather difficult in a general
higher derivative gravity theory (e.g. [33, 34]).
     However, if one is only interested in computing the expectation value of the stress tensor
in higher derivative gravity rather than its general correlation functions, the “entanglement
first law” method for deriving the holographic dictionary can provide an easy alternative. The
reason for this simplification — besides not having to deal with the variational principle —
is that one can perform all calculations at linearized level, where all higher derivative gravity
theories effectively reduce to R2 theories. A scaling argument can then be used to argue that
the linearized answer holds quite generally.

For a general Lagrangian built from curvatures but no covariant derivatives of curvatures,
ERabcd is a function of g ab and Rabcd . Evaluated on an AdS background, which is maximally

symmetric and thus satisfies

the Wald functional takes the following simple form

                                          abcd
                                         ER    = c1 ghab gcdi                                     (6.8)
for some constant c1 . The indices inside the h , i brackets are (anti)symmetrized so that the
resulting object has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor, as in [34].
     To compute δER abcd , we use the chain rule


                                        ∂ERabcd           abcd
                                                        ∂ER

                             δER    =           δg    +         δRef gh .                         (6.9)

The partial derivatives above are to be evaluated on the background AdS, so using eq. (6.7),
they can be expressed entirely in terms of products of the unperturbed AdS metric, with
various contractions and symmetrizations. Letting

                                 δgab = −hab ,         δRabcd = Rabcd                            (6.10)
                                     abcd is then
the general form of the linearized δER
     abcd
   δER    = −c2 ghab gcdi h − c3 hhab gcdi + ℓ2 c4 ghab gcdi R + ℓ2 c5 Rhab gcdi + ℓ2 c6 Rabcd   (6.11)

where the first two terms come from the partial derivative of ERabcd with respect to g ef , and

the last three from the partial derivative with respect to the Riemann tensor, evaluated on
AdS. All indices are raised and contracted with the background metric gab . Note that not all
coefficients ci introduced above are independent, but rather they satisfy

                       c2 = −2d c4 − c5 ,      c3 = 2 c1 − (d − 1) c5 − 4 c6 .                   (6.12)

These constraints follow from the fact that the most general Wald functional that is linear in
the Riemann tensor takes the form (6.27) — see below — which is parametrized by just four
constants. Eq. (6.28) then shows that the six coefficients ci satisfy two additional relations.




                                                – 26 –
    To finalize our computation of the linearized Wald functional, we only need to evaluate
the linearized Riemann tensor, given by
           1                                                  1
  Rabcd = (∇c ∇b had − ∇b ∇b hac + ∇b ∇a hbc − ∇c ∇a hbd ) + (Raecd he b + Re bcd hae ) . (6.13)

For the computation of the holographic stress tensor (6.1), we only need the leading behaviour
of the Riemann tensor as R → 0. This can be easily evaluated by noting that z ∝ R and z-
derivatives of the metric perturbation dominate over xµ -derivatives as z → 0. More explicitly,
near the boundary we can write
                                               hµν (z, xλ ) = z ∆−2 h(∆)  λ
                                                                     µν (x ) + · · ·                                    (6.14)
for some ∆ to be determined, where the dots indicate terms at higher order in z. Then, we
can replace ∂z hµν = (∆ − 2)z −1 hµν and ignore all xµ -derivatives, because ∂µ ∼ O(1) will
always be subleading in the R expansion, as compared to ∂z ∼ O(R−1 ). Consequently, in
taking R → 0, we can approximate19

We can then substitute this simplified expression into20 eq. (6.11) and further into eq. (6.6).
Upon contracting with xA xB , the integrand will contain terms proportional to htt , δij hij and
hij xi xj ; using spherical symmetry, the latter can be replaced by ~x2 δij hij /(d−1). Furthermore,
we can write hij δij = hµν η µν + htt . The final answer takes the form

     It is not hard to see that if we had also allowed derivatives of the Riemann tensor into the Wald functional,
their linearized leading contribution to the entropy as R → 0 would also be linear in hµν with no derivatives,
due to the above scaling argument. Their contribution would typically be of the same order as the polynomial
one, and straightforward if a bit tedious to compute.

Using eq. (6.14), it is not hard to verify that the leading contribution in eq. (6.17) scales as
R∆ , so we must choose ∆ = d to obtain a finite result in eq. (6.1). Thus, we find again, as in
Einstein gravity, that in order for the first law of entanglement to be satisfied, the asymptotic
expansion of the metric should start at order z d−2 . Performing the integral in eq. (6.17) with
∆ = d, we find that

As in Einstein gravity, tracelessness and conservation of Tµν imply that21
                                                                  (d)

This gives the holographic stress for a theory in which the Wald entropy is an arbitrary
function of the Riemann tensor, but not its covariant derivatives. The coefficients ci are
defined in eqs. (6.8) and (6.11).
     Note that to this point, we have only been considering the leading contribution to the
expectation value of the stress tensor. That is, as noted in footnote 4, we are considering
a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i with |Ψ(0)i = |0i and within this family, δhTµν i ≡
∂λ hTµν i|λ=0 . However, we will now argue that our result extends beyond this leading order to
                                                                               (d)
give a general prescription for hTµν i. In particular, the fact that hTµν i ∝ hµν simply follows
from conformal invariance: there is no other field in spacetime that has the correct tensor
structure and transformation properties under rescalings.22 Thus, the above expression for the
                                  (d)
stress tensor holds even when hµν is finite. Another way to see this fact is to note that since
  21
     When α + β d = 0, the vanishing of the trace of the stress tensor no longer implies h(d)µ µ = 0. Using our
results from section 6.3, it is easy to check that precisely at this value of the ci , the additional scalar operator
present in higher curvature gravity — which couples to the trace of the metric — has dimension ∆ = d, and
thus appears at the same order in the asymptotic z expansion as the traceless mode that couples to the CFT
stress tensor.
  22
     There are a few exceptions to this, such as a gauge field in three space-time dimensions, which can
contribute to the stress tensor at quadratic order, or when fields have finely-tuned dimensions that can add
up to d.

         T hTµν iR in the CFT, or hµν R in spacetime. Applicability of the first law only
requires that ε << 1, see also the appendix of [35]. Thus, we can either have hTtt i small and
R finite, or hTtt i finite and R → 0. In the first case, we can derive the linearized gravitational
equations in the entire bulk, by taking the amplitude of the perturbation to be small and
using the Wald functional method. In the second case, we can derive the leading asymptotic
expansion of the metric (as z → 0) for a general non-linear solution.

6.2     Examples
We now give some explicit examples employing the general formula (6.24) and compare with
known results in the literature.

6.2.1    The holographic stress tensor in R2 gravity
To begin, consider the case of an arbitrary R2 gravity theory in d + 1 dimensions, which
contains all possible contractions of the Riemann tensor but no derivatives thereof. It is
convenient to write the most general Lagrangian of such a theory as
                                                                                

             16πGN       ℓ̃2

where ℓ̃ is the scale parametrizing the (negative) cosmological constant. We also use ℓ̃ to set
the scale in the curvature-squared terms, which leaves ai as dimensionless couplings controlling
the strength of these interactions. We assume that the parameters are chosen such that the
theory admits an AdSd+1 vacuum solution of radius ℓ. In fact, it is straightforward to show
the AdS radius is determined by the parameters in the Lagrangian (6.25) by the following
quadratic equation

                        ℓ4 ℓ2 d − 3
                           −   +      (2 a1 + d a2 + d(d + 1) a3 ) = 0 .                    (6.26)
                        ℓ̃4 ℓ̃2 d − 1

Of course, ℓ = ℓ̃ when the ai are set to zero. To construct the Wald entropy (1.5), we consider
the variation of the Lagrangian with respect to the curvature, as in eq. (5.10)

We have checked that eq. (6.29) agrees perfectly with previous results in the literature that
used more standard holographic techniques: see, for example, equation (51) of [36] for the
case d = 3. We have also checked that in general d our answer agrees with the holographic
stress tensor of [34], when the results of that paper are applied to a flat boundary metric
and the volume divergences are subtracted. Note that the covariant expression of [34] for the
holographic stress tensor in terms of induced fields at the boundary obscures somewhat the
simplicity of the final answer (6.29) for hTµν i, which is dictated by scaling.23

This particular example has been studied previously in section 3.4 of [36], for the case d = 3.
The authors of that paper were investigating black hole thermodynamics in the above theory,
and found that in order for the first law to hold, the mass of the black hole had to be
independent of the coefficient of the R4 term. In this subsection, we will use the holographic
entanglement method for computing the stress tensor expectation value to confirm their result.
    The Wald functional for this theory reads
                                                                              

    This scaling property might be more obvious if one used instead the Hamiltonian method for holographic
renormalization [26]. Nevertheless, one would still need to deal with the variational principle with that ap-
proach.

so our general expression (6.24) gives
                                                                      !

                                                 (3)
Thus, precisely in d = 3 we have hTtt i = 3htt /(16πGN ). The explicit solution (142)-(143)
in [36] for the metric of the black hole in presence of the R4 term shows that h00 = m is
uncorrected by the higher derivative term. Hence we also conclude that the mass of the black
hole is uncorrected, in agreement with the expectation of [36].

6.3   Other terms in the FG expansion
A feature of higher derivative gravity is the existence of additional degrees of freedom con-
tained in the metric. This occurs because the equations of motion are no longer second order.
These new degrees of freedom will appear as new terms in the asymptotic FG expansion,
which according to the usual AdS/CFT lore will represent new operators in the dual CFT.
Here we show how the entanglement first law can be used to derive the FG expansion for
these new modes, including a derivation of the conformal dimensions of the CFT operators
to which they couple.
      Of course, the physical interpretation of these modes is unclear. First, they typically have
negative norm indicating that the boundary theory is no longer unitary [37], and second,
their masses are typically at the string scale where the low energy effective field theory is
unreliable. Nonetheless, they do satisfy the equations of motion, so we can ask how they fit
mathematically into our discussion of the first law.
                                                                                            grav
      These new modes appear as additional solutions to the first law constraint δSB             =
    grav
δEB . Previously, we argued that a metric perturbation of the form (6.14) that satisfies the
first law relation must have ∆ = d and be related to the stress tensor expectation value as
we described in the preceding section. Nevertheless, perturbations with ∆ 6= d, with ∆ an
                                                                      grav
arbitrary real number, are also allowed, as long as they satisfy δSB       = 0.
      To show how this works explicitly, we consider the example of general R2 gravity, with
Lagrangian given by eq. (6.25). We consider a metric perturbation of the form (6.14). The x
integral in eq. (6.6) is convergent as long as ∆ > d − 2. Performing this integral, we find

We can then satisfy the equation δSB     = 0 at leading order in R, the radius of the ball,

We have checked that these expressions agree with the coefficients of the asymptotic falloffs
of solutions to the equations of motion in R2 gravity.25 Also, for d = 3, ∆+

operator dimension that was obtained in [36], also by solving the asymptotic equations of

motion are satisfied, a claim which we use in section 5.3.

7        Discussion

In this paper, we have seen that a universal relation between entanglement entropy and ‘mod-
ular’ energy for small perturbations to the vacuum state of a CFT leads, in the holographic
context, to a nonlocal constraint on the dual spacetimes, which is exactly equivalent to the
linearized gravitational equations. Thus, given any holographic CFT, we can derive the lin-
earized bulk equations knowing only the entanglement functional. Moreover, as we showed
in sections 4.1 and 6, we can also derive the asymptotic boundary conditions for the metric
perturbation, as well as an expression for the holographic stress tensor. When matter cou-
plings to curvature vanish, these results taken together imply that from the entanglement
functional, we can derive the complete map from states to metrics at the linearized level
about the vacuum.
     We have also shown that this non-local gravitational constraint is precisely the first law
of black hole thermodynamics (in the form proved by Iyer and Wald) applied to certain

                           S,T solutions are physical, since only for them does the x integral converge. It is
                                grav
interesting though that the δSB      = 0 constraint also knows about the non-normalizable modes in gravity,
including the perturbation of the boundary metric, with ∆ = 0.

Rindler patches of pure AdS that can be also interpreted as zero-mass hyperbolic black holes.
Thus, we have a result that holds purely in classical gravity: in any classical gravitational
theory for which anti-de Sitter space is a solution and for which the first law of black hole
thermodynamics holds for some Wald functional SWald , small perturbations about the AdS
vacuum solution are governed by the linearized gravitational equations obtained from varying
the Lagrangian associated to SWald . This provides a converse to the theorem of Iyer and Wald,
but also a microscopic understanding of the origin of the Iyer-Wald first law for AdS-Rindler
horizons.

Relation to the work of Jacobson
The results in this paper are reminiscent of (and partly motivated by) the work of Jacob-
son [17] (see also [38–40]). There, it was shown that if the first law of thermodynamics –
governing the local change in entropy (defined to be horizon area) as a certain bulk energy
flows through the horizon – is assumed to hold for an arbitrary Rindler horizon, then the
full nonlinear Einstein equations must be satisfied. In Jacobson’s case, there was no micro-
scopic understanding of the meaning of the entropy, and thus no fundamental understanding
of why the thermodynamic relation should hold. By contrast, in our case there is a pre-
cise microscopic understanding of both the energy and the entropy appearing in our relation
δSB = δEB , and a proof of the first law at the microscopic level. Also, our gravity analysis
applies to an arbitrary higher curvature theory, a scenario that is problematic with Jacobson’s
approach [39]. On the other hand, because our proof is based on global rather than local
Rindler horizons, we were only able to obtain the gravitational equations of motion at the
linearized level.

Deriving the nonlinear equations?
It is obviously interesting to ask whether we can extend our results to the nonlinear level.
On the CFT side, the entanglement entropies for finite perturbations to the vacuum state are
still constrained by the modular energies, but the constraint is the inequality ∆SA ≤ ∆hHA i
following from the positivity of relative entropy. For any ball-shaped region, we can still
translate this inequality to a constraint on the bulk metric. The set of all such constraints
should significantly restrict the allowed bulk spacetimes, but it seems unlikely that these
restrictions will fully determine the bulk equations at the nonlinear level. In particular, the
nonlinear gravitational equations are sensitive to all the other fields present in the classical
bulk theory, including the components of the metric along any extra compact directions.
These additional degrees of freedom depend significantly on which holographic CFT we are
considering. Thus, starting from the universal relation ∆SA ≤ ∆hHA i (or any other universal
relation for holographic CFTs) one might realistically expect to recover only a part of the
constraints implied by the full non-linear equations; for example, one might obtain Einstein’s
equations with the additional assumption that no other matter fields are turned on in the
bulk.




                                            – 33 –
     Another interesting possibility is that one might be able to obtain some constraints at
the nonlinear level in the bulk even from the linearized entanglement first law, by considering
bulk perturbations which are kept finite but taken to be localized closer and closer to the
AdS-Rindler horizon. In such a limit, the energy perturbation in the CFT vanishes due to
gravitational redshift effects. By considering infinitesimal perturbations away from this limit,
the linearized CFT first law should apply, but on the gravity side, it would appear that we
will obtain constraints on a finite perturbation localized near the horizon. This may be closely
related to the approach of Jacobson.

Quantum first law in the bulk
Finally, it would be interesting to understand the implications of the entanglement first law (in
its infinitesimal form) beyond the classical level on the gravity side. Since the entanglement
first law is an exact relation, it can also be used to study subleading quantum gravitational
corrections to the classical results that we have derived, or CFT states that do not have
a classical bulk interpretation. These quantum states/corrections can be easily identified
by the scaling of their energy and entropy with the central charge in the CFT: while the
classical contributions are proportional to the central charge, the quantum ones scale with a
lower power of it. Thus, the first law should place constraints on the quantum behaviour of
the bulk gravitational theory and will likely also involve an understanding of the quantum
corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as discussed recently in [41–43].

where dA represents the area element on B̃. Now we can repeat the argument replacing
f → xi f in (A.1), and deduce that all moments of f vanish on every hemisphere B̃. We
conclude that f = 0, as we needed to show.
    An alternative argument for the vanishing of f is to note that the integral in (A.3), viewed
as a map from B̃ to R, defines the “hyperbolic Radon transform” of the function f , whose
vanishing implies the vanishing of the function, assuming that f is continuous [44].

    Next, remember that the Noether current (5.6) satisfies dJ[ξ] = −εE φ δξ φ. Using (B.2)
and the Noether identity, this becomes

                                       dJ[ξ] = d(ξ a Ca )                               (B.4)

for all diffeomorphisms ξ. It follows that [30]

                                    J[ξ] = dQ[ξ] + ξ a Ca ,                             (B.5)

for some Q, which we take to be the off-shell definition of the Noether charge Q.

D     Form of the bulk charge

In this appendix, we show that the linearized modular energy defined by the bulk Wald-
Noether procedure always take the simple form noted in eq. (5.29). We start with eq. (5.25),
reproduced here for convenience:
                                     Z

where the Killing vector ξB is given in eq. (3.1). Into this equation we would like to substitute
the asymptotic form of the metric perturbation (5.27), representing the stress tensor pertur-
bation. As we argued in the main text, modes with different falloffs will not contribute, since
they have the wrong scaling dimension.
    As shown in [16], the most general form of Q[ξ] is

                         Q[ξ] = Xcd ∇[c ξd] + Wc ξ c + Y(φ, Lξ φ) + dZ(ξ, φ)                                 (D.2)

where Y is linear in Lξ φ, Z is linear in ξ, and all forms are covariant expressions constructed
from the fields. We assume there is no matter with linear couplings to curvature. The general
covariant form of Xcd is
                                         Xcd = X abcd εab                                  (D.3)
where X abcd is antisymmetric in both is first two and last two indices. Using symmetry and
arguments similar to those in section 6, at zeroth and first order around AdS and to leading
in the z expansion, we must have (ignoring coefficients)

                     X abcd         ∝ ghab g cdi ,    δX abcd ∝ ghab gcdi h + hhab gcdi .                    (D.4)

The contribution of the first term in eq. (D.2) to δE(1)  is then

where the quantities without δ’s are evaluated on the background AdS solution. The non-zero
background components are

                 dd−1 x                    xi                    R2 − |~x|2                        [c
   εab → εtz ∝          ,     ∇[i ξt] =        ,     ∇[z ξt] =              ,       X tzcd ∝ z 4 δt δzd] .   (D.6)

Using eq. (D.4), the leading behaviour of the linearized quantities reads

     δX tztz ∝ z 6 (htt + hµν η µν ) ,     δX tzti ∝ z 7 (∂i htt + . . .) ,     δ(∇[z ξt] ) ∝ ζ t ∂z htt     (D.7)

It is clear from the above expressions that only the leading terms in X tztz and δX tztz will
contribute as z → 0. Plugging in the z-dependence of hµν , one finds that all the non-vanishing
                                   (d)     (d)                             (d)      (d)    (d)
contributions are proportional to htt or hi i . Requiring moreover that hµ µ = hi i − htt =
0, which follows from tracelessness of the CFT stress tensor, we find that
                                           Z
                                                     (d)
                                     IX ∝ dd−1 x htt ζ t                                  (D.8)

where we used the fact that limz→0 ξ t = ζ t .
     The contribution of the Wc ξ c = Wt ζ t term is easy to evaluate, taking into account the
fact that the d − 1 form Wc is a covariant expression constructed from hab , gab and their




                                                     – 37 –
background covariant derivatives. The most general form of Wc , linearized around AdS, is
thus

     Wc = εab F ab c ,   F ab c = f1 ()(∇a hb c − ∇b ha c ) + f2 ()(δa c ∇b h − δb c ∇a h) .    (D.9)

The only non-zero contribution on B will be from F [tz] t , and using tracelessness of the leading
term in h one can easily show that
                                Z           Z
                                                           (d)
                                        c
                                   Wc ξ ∝      dd−1 x htt ζ t .                             (D.10)
                                    B             B

The ξ · Θ term in eq. (D.2) has the same form as Wc ξ c so can be treated similarly.
    The term Y in eq. (D.2) comes from the ambiguity Θ → Θ + dY(δφ). Together, these
terms contribute to χ in the combination

                                        δY(δξ φ) − δξ Y(δφ) .                                    (D.11)

This vanishes for a background Killing vector.
     Finally, the dZ term is an ambiguity that comes from the fact that Q is only defined by
its derivative. We fix this ambiguity to zero by requiring that there are no boundary terms
in the horizon entropy.
     The overall conclusion is
                                             Z
