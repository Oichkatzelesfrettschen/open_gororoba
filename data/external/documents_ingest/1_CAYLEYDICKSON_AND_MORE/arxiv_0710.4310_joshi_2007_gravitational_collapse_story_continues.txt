                                                   We define the thin fundamental categorical group P2 (M, ∗) of a based
                                               smooth manifold (M, ∗) as the categorical group whose objects are rank-1

                                               maps are rank-n homotopic, when the rank of the differential of the homo-

                                               from a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). We construct categorical
                                               holonomies, defined to be smooth morphisms P2 (M, ∗) → C(G), by using

                                               P with values in the Lie algebra of E, with the pair (ω, m) satisfying suit-

Introduction
Categorification is an influential idea in many areas of mathematics, and in
geometry it is natural to try and think about categorifying the notions of holon-
omy and parallel transport in terms of higher categorical generalisations of the
notions of loop, Lie group and connection on a principal bundle, in the spirit
of Baez and Schreiber [B, BS]. In this article we construct a framework for
2-dimensional, or surface, holonomy along such lines. The based loops on a
manifold M are replaced by what we call the (strict) thin fundamental cate-
gorical group of M , P2 (M, ∗), a monoidal category whose objects are rank-1
homotopy classes of based loops on M and whose morphisms are rank-2 ho-
motopy classes of homotopies between based loops (or 1-parameter families of
loops). Here, rank-1 homotopy, at the level of loops, means that the loops are
homotopic in such a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy be-
tween them is less than or equal to 1, i.e. the homotopies between loops do not
sweep out area. Similarly, at the level of morphisms, two homotopies between
based loops are rank-2 homotopic, if they themselves are homotopic in such
a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy between them is less
than or equal to 2, i.e. the homotopy between homotopies does not sweep out
volume. For precise definitions, we refer to subsections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The Lie
group is replaced by a categorical Lie group, C(G), naturally obtained from a
crossed module of Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). The connection on a princi-
pal G-bundle P over M is replaced by what we call a categorical connection,
consisting of a connection 1-form on P with values in g, the Lie algebra of G,
together with a 2-form on P with values in e, the Lie algebra of E, satisfying
some conditions including the well-known “vanishing of the fake curvature”.
Locally these conditions correspond to Baez and Schreiber’s [BS] local formu-
lation for a 2-connection. The Maurer-Cartan structure equation and Bianchi
identity for the curvature of an ordinary connection are shown to have natural
analogues for the curvature 3-form of the categorical connection. Also a variant
of the Ambrose-Singer theorem (which plays a crucial role in our construction
of categorical holonomy) generalises to a higher-order version.
    A categorical holonomy is defined to be a (strict monoidal) smooth functor
from P2 (M, ∗) to C(G). The main result that we prove (Thm. 39) is how a
categorical connection gives rise to a categorical holonomy. The underlying
geometrical idea is to lift the 1-parameter family of loops into P , horizontally in
one direction, namely the direction along the loops, and to use this lift to pull
back the forms of the categorical connection, which are then integrated suitably.
    Note that the appearance of a principal G-bundle P with a connection is
natural in the context of categorical holonomies. This is because, at the level of
the set of objects of P2 (M, ∗), i.e. π11 (M, ∗), the thin homotopy classes of based
loops on M , any smooth functor P2 (M, ∗) → G gives rise to a smooth group
morphism π11 (M, ∗) → G, and therefore it defines a principal G-bundle over M


                                         3
with a connection [CP, MP].
    The whole construction is carried out using the language and methods of dif-
ferential geometry and principal bundles, thereby avoiding working with infinite-
dimensional path spaces, which was an approach taken in [BS]. The construction
is coordinate-free from the outset, since we use forms defined on P . We remark
that the construction of P2 (M, ∗) is of interest in its own right in defining a
strict thin fundamental categorical group of a manifold (previously only a weak
version was known). This part of our construction is very similar to that of
[BHKP, HKK].
    We study the relation between our construction and non-abelian gerbes, as in
[BrMe], and 2-bundles, as in [BS], in 2.4.6. Note that each 2-bundle with struc-
ture 2-group coming from a crossed module of the form (Ad : G → Aut(G), ⊲),
where ⊲ denotes the obvious left action of Aut(G) in G, is naturally a non-abelian
gerbe. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Our construction cor-
responds to a particular case of G-2-bundles, for which the E-valued transition
functions are trivial, and therefore the G-valued transition functions satisfy the
usual cocycle condition for a principal G-bundle. Although G-2-bundles are
a natural way to approach two-dimensional holonomy, we emphasise that our
main goal is the definition of categorical group maps P2 (M, ∗) → C(G). This is
a very strong condition, and we argue that it should force the G-2-bundle with
connection to be of the special form considered here - see 2.4.6 where this point
is elaborated.
    At the end of this article we define the notion of Wilson sphere, which means
that a categorical holonomy, taking values in the kernel of ∂ : E → G, can be
associated to embedded spheres in a manifold, up to acting by an element of
the group G.


1       Preliminaries
1.1     Resumé of results and notation from the theory of
        principal fibre bundles
1.1.1    Connections on principal fibre bundles
For full details on connections on principal fibre bundles see [KN, P].
    Let M be a paracompact smooth manifold. Let G be a Lie group with Lie
algebra g. Consider a principal G-bundle P over M , with canonical projection
π : P → M . For each x ∈ M , let Px = π −1 (x) be the fibre at x. Let also X(P )
denote the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on P . Recall that there exists a Lie
                                                              d
algebra morphism A ∈ g 7→ A# ∈ X(P ), such that A#      u = dt u exp(tA)t=0 , ∀u ∈
P, ∀A ∈ g. Here if X ∈ X(P ) is a vector field then Xu ∈ Tu P (the tangent space
of P at u ∈ P ) denotes the value of X at the point u.
    Denote the right action of G on P as g ∈ G 7→ Rg ∈ diff(P ), where diff(P )
denotes the diffeomorphism group of P . Recall the following very useful formula:
                                                     #
                            (Rg )∗ (A# ) = g −1 Ag        ,


                                         4
where g ∈ G and A ∈ g. Given an element u ∈ P , recall that a vector Xu ∈ Tu P
is said to be vertical if π∗ (Xu ) = 0. Let TuV P denote the subspace of vertical
vectors in Tu P . Notice that any Xu ∈ TuV P is of the form A# u for some A ∈ g,
and this correspondence is one-to-one.
    Let ω ∈ A1 (P, g) be a connection on P . In other words ω is a smooth 1-form
on P with values in g such that:
  1. Rg∗ (ω) = g −1 ωg, ∀g ∈ G,

  2. ω(A# ) = A, ∀A ∈ g.
Given an element u ∈ P , let TuH P = {Xu ∈ Tu P : ω(Xu ) = 0}, the horizontal
subspace at u ∈ P . Then TuH is a complementary subspace of TuV P in Tu P for
each u ∈ P . Moreover, the following identity holds for each g ∈ G and u ∈ P :
                                     
                                TuH P g = TugH
                                               P.

    The natural projection maps X ∈ T P 7→ X H and X ∈ T P 7→ X V are
smooth. Here T P denotes the tangent bundle of P . There exists also a unique
map X ∈ X(M ) 7→ X    e ∈ X(P ), called the horizontal lift of X ∈ X(M ), such
      e       H
that Xu ∈ Tu P, ∀u ∈ P and π∗ (X) e = X, for any X ∈ X(M ), the Lie algebra
of smooth vector fields on M . Note that this horizontal lift gives rise to linear
maps Tx M → Tu P , if π(u) = x, where x ∈ M and u ∈ P . The horizontal lift of
a vector field X ∈ X(M ) is always G-invariant. In other words:

                                  e = X,
                                  Xg  e ∀g ∈ G.

1.1.2   Curvature
Let P be a principal G-bundle over M . Let ω ∈ A1 (P, g) be a connection 1-form
on P . Given an n-form a on P , the exterior covariant derivative of a is given by

                          Da = da ◦ (H
                                     | × H{z. . . × H}).
                                        (n+1)-times


    Let Ω ∈ A2 (P, g) be the curvature 2-form of the connection ω. It can be
defined as the exterior covariant derivative Dω of the connection 1-form ω, in
other words:
                           Ω(X, Y ) = dω(X H , Y H ),
where X, Y ∈ X(P ). The curvature 2-form Ω is G-equivariant, which means:

                            Rg∗ (Ω) = g −1 Ωg, ∀g ∈ G.

Recall also Cartan’s structure equation:

                     dω(X, Y ) + [ω(X), ω(Y )] = Ω(X, Y ),                    (1)



                                        5
valid for any vector fields X, Y ∈ X(P ). The Bianchi identity can be stated by
saying that the exterior covariant derivative DΩ of the curvature form is zero,
in other words:
                          DΩ = dΩ ◦ (H × H × H) = 0.                        (2)
The Bianchi identity can also be written as:

    dΩ(X, Y, Z) + [ω(X), Ω(Y, Z)] + [ω(Y ), Ω(Z, X)] + [ω(Z), Ω(X, Y )] = 0,

for any smooth vector fields X, Y, Z ∈ X(P ).

1.1.3   Parallel transport
Let P be a principal G-bundle over the manifold M . Let ω ∈ A1 (P, g) be a
connection on P . Recall that ω determines a parallel transport along smooth
curves. Specifically, given x ∈ M and a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M , with
γ(0) = x, then there exists a smooth map:

                      (t, u) ∈ [0, 1] × Px 7→ Hω (γ, t, u) ∈ P,

uniquely defined by the conditions:
                             
      d                 ^
                        d
  1. dt Hω (γ, t, u) = dt γ(t)                  ; ∀t ∈ [0, 1], ∀u ∈ Px ,
                                   Hω (γ,t,u)

  2. Hω (γ, 0, u) = u; ∀u ∈ Px .

In particular this implies that Hω (γ, t), given by u 7→ Hω (γ, t, u), maps Px
bijectively into Pγ(t) , for any t ∈ [0, 1]. Recall that the parallel transport is
G-equivariant, in other words:

                  Hω (γ, t, ug) = Hω (γ, t, u)g, ∀g ∈ G, ∀u ∈ Px .

1.1.4    The dependence of the parallel transport on a smooth family
         of curves - the Ambrose-Singer theorem
                                        .
Let M be a smooth manifold. Let Dn = [0, 1]n be the n-cube, where n ∈ N. A
map f : Dn → M is said to be smooth if its partial derivatives of any order exist
and are continuous as maps Dn → M . Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra
g. Consider a smooth principal G-bundle π : P → M with a connection 1-form
ω ∈ A1 (P, g).
     Now let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ γs be a smooth 1-parameter family of smooth curves
[0, 1] → M . Here smooth means that the map Γ : (t, s) ∈ [0, 1]2 7→ γs (t) ∈ M
is smooth. Define the initial point map q : [0, 1] → M by q(s) = γs (0) for each
s ∈ [0, 1]. Choose u ∈ Pq(0) and set us = Hω (q, s, u) ∈ Pq(s) , where s ∈ [0, 1].
Our purpose is to analyse the s-dependence of Hω (γs , t, us ), where s, t ∈ [0, 1],
by calculating:
                                    ∂
                                       Hω (γs , t, us ).

This analysis is of course classical.
   For convenience of notation, define
                             f (s, t) = Hω (γs , t, us ); s, t ∈ [0, 1].
                                                    ∂      ∂
Let the coordinate vector fields of [0, 1]2 be ∂t     and ∂s . We have:
                                             
            ∂      ∂               ∂             ∂

                                = f ∗ (dω)        ,      +    f (ω)

                                                              
                                         ∂            ∂
                                = dω        f (s, t), f (s, t) .
                                         ∂t           ∂s
Note that the second equation follows from the well-known formula
                       dφ(X, Y ) = Xφ(Y ) − Y φ(X) − φ([X, Y ]),                           (3)
valid for any 2-form φ on a manifold M and any X, Y ∈ X(M ). The last
                                       ∂
equation follows from the fact that ∂t   f (s, t) is horizontal, by definition of parallel
transport.
                                                                              ∂
    Therefore by Cartan’s structure equation (1) and the fact that ∂t           f (s, t) is
horizontal it follows that:
                                                                 

                      ω      f (s, t) = Ω         f (s, t), f (s, t) .                 (4)
                   ∂t     ∂s                   ∂t          ∂s
Since Ω(X, Y ) = 0 if either of the vectors X or Y is vertical we can conclude:
                                               H             H !

   Note that, by definition of parallel transport, we have
                         H                           !

     Going back to equation (4), we have that, for each s ∈ [0, 1], ω ∂s  f (s, 0) =
                                              ∂
0, since f (s, 0) = us = Hω (q, s, u), hence ∂s f (s, 0) is horizontal for each s ∈
[0, 1]. We thus arrive at the following well known result:

                                                 7
Lemma 1 Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g. Let P be a smooth principal
G-bundle over the manifold M . Let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ γs be a smooth 1-parameter
family of curves [0, 1] → M . Here smooth means that the map (s, t) ∈ [0, 1]2 7→
γs (t) ∈ M is smooth. Consider a connection ω ∈ A1 (P, g). Let q : [0, 1] → M
be the curve such that q(s) = γs (0), ∀s ∈ [0, 1]. Choose u ∈ Pq(0) , and let us =
Hω (q, s, u) ∈ Pq(s) , where s ∈ [0, 1]. The following holds for each s, t′ ∈ [0, 1]:

    Consider the case when all curves γs : [0, 1] → M , where s ∈ [0, 1], are closed,
though possibly with varying initial points. (This flexibility will be important
to define Wilson spheres in 2.5.3). Then we can define a family of holonomies
gγs ∈ G, where s ∈ [0, 1], by:
                             us gγs = Hω (γs , 1, us ), ∀s ∈ [0, 1].
We will use the preceding lemma to obtain a differential equation satisfied by
g γs .

Since, for each s ∈ [0, 1], the vector us ds gγs is vertical, this means, by the second

1.2      Crossed modules
All Lie groups and Lie algebras are taken to be finite-dimensional.

Definition 3 (Lie crossed module) A crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) is
given by a group morphism ∂ : E → G together with a left action ⊲ of G on E
by automorphisms, such that:

     1. ∂(X ⊲ e) = X∂(e)X −1; ∀X ∈ G, ∀e ∈ E,
     2. ∂(e) ⊲ f = ef e−1 ; ∀e, f ∈ E.

If both G and E are Lie groups, ∂ : E → G is a smooth morphism, and the left
action of G on E is smooth then G will be called a Lie crossed module.

  A morphism G → G ′ between the crossed modules G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) and
G = (∂ ′ : E ′ → G′ , ⊲′ ) is given by a pair of maps φ : G → G′ and ψ : E → E ′
 ′

making the diagram:
                                              ∂
                                          E −−−−→ G
                                                 
                                          
                                         ψy
                                                  φ
                                                  y
                                             ∂′
                                 E ′ −−−−→ G′
commutative. In addition we must have ψ(X ⊲ e) = φ(X) ⊲′ ψ(e) for each e ∈ E
and each X ∈ G.
    Given a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲), then the induced Lie algebra
map ∂ : e → g, together with the derived action of g on e (also denoted by ⊲)
is a differential crossed module, in the sense of the following definition - see
[BS, B, BC].

Definition 4 (Differential crossed module) A differential crossed module,
say G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲), is given by a Lie algebra morphism ∂ : e → g together
with a left action of g on the underlying vector space of e, such that:
     1. For any X ∈ g the map e ∈ e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is a derivation of e, in other
        words
                 X ⊲ [e, f ] = [X ⊲ e, f ] + [e, X ⊲ f ]; ∀X ∈ g, ∀e, f ∈ e.

     2. The map g → Der(e) from g into the derivation algebra of e induced by
        the action of g on e is a Lie algebra morphism. In other words:

                  [X, Y ] ⊲ e = X ⊲ (Y ⊲ e) − Y ⊲ (X ⊲ e); ∀X, Y ∈ g, ∀e ∈ e.

     3. ∂(X ⊲ e) = [X, ∂(e)]; ∀X ∈ g, ∀e ∈ e.
     4. ∂(e) ⊲ f = [e, f ]; ∀e, f ∈ e.




                                              9
Note that the map (X, e) ∈ g × e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is necessarily bilinear.
   Therefore, given a differential crossed module, G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) there exists
a unique crossed module of simply connected Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)
whose differential form is G, up to isomorphism. The proof of this result is
standard Lie theory, together with the lift of the Lie algebra action to a Lie
group action, which can be found in [K], Thm 1.102.

Example 5 Let G be a Lie group with a left action ⊲ on an abelian group V by
automorphisms, for example take V to be any representation of G on a vector
space. If we put ∂ = 1G then (∂ : V → G, ⊲) is a Lie crossed module. Its
differential form is given by the derived action of g on V and the zero map
V → g.

Example 6 Let G be any Lie group. Let Ad denote the adjoint action of G on
G. Then (id : G → G, Ad) is a Lie crossed module.

Example 7 Let G and E be Lie groups, and let ∂ : E → G be a surjective map
such that ker(∂) is central in E. Define a left action of G on E as g ⊲e = g0 eg0−1 ,
where g0 ∈ E is such that ∂(g0 ) = g ∈ G, and e ∈ E. Then G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)
is a Lie crossed module.

Example 8 In the previous example, we can take the universal covering map
SU(2) → SO(3), whose kernel is {±1}. The differential form of this crossed
module is given by the adjoint action of su(2) on su(2) and the identity map.

Example 9 More generally, take the universal cover ∂ : E → G of the Lie
group G. Then the construction in example 7 can be applied since the kernel of
∂ is necessarily central in E.

Example 10 Let H be the group of upper triangular matrices in R which only
have 1’s in the main diagonal. Define a Lie group map ∂ : H → R2 as
                                      
                                1 a b
                           ∂ 0 1 c  = (a, c),
                                0 0 1

where a, b, c ∈ R. Then the kernel of ∂ : H → R2 is central in H, and therefore
the construction in example 7 can be applied.

Example 11 Let E be any Lie group. Let Aut(E) be the group of automor-
phisms of E. Then Aut(E) is a Lie group, in fact it is a Lie subgroup of GL(e) if
E is simply connected. Consider the map Ad : E → Aut(E) that sends e ∈ E to
the automorphism Ad(e) : E → E. The group Aut(E) acts on E as φ ⊲ e = φ(e)
where φ ∈ Aut(E) and e ∈ E. Then (Ad : E → Aut(E), ⊲) is a Lie crossed
module.

The previous construction yields several examples of Lie crossed modules. For
instance, example 8 is obtained this way since Aut(SU(2)) = SO(3). To get new
examples, however, we need to consider non-semisimple Lie groups.

Example 12 In example 11, take E = H, the group of upper triangular 3 × 3
matrices in R, which only have 1’s in the main diagonal. Then the crossed
module (Ad : H → Aut(H), ⊲) is highly non-trivial. In fact, Ad(E) is isomorphic
to R2 , whereas the cokernel Out(E) of Ad is isomorphic to GL(2, R), see [KH].
The kernel of Ad is a central subgroup of H isomorphic to R; see example 10.

as well as a “group inversion” functor −1 : C → C such that both the set of ob-
jects C0 of C and the set of morphisms C1 of C are groups under the tensor
product, and both the source and target maps σ, τ : C1 → C0 are group mor-
phisms. A Lie categorical group is defined analogously by replacing groups by
Lie groups and group morphisms by Lie group morphisms.

     See [BM, BL] for more details.

Definition 14 (Morphism of categorical groups) A morphism of categor-
ical groups is given by a strict monoidal functor; see [ML].

    It is well-known that the category of crossed modules and the category of
categorical groups are equivalent; see for example [BL, BM, BHS]. Let us ex-
plain how to define a categorical group C(G) from a crossed module G. This
construction is an old one.
    Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a crossed module. The set of objects C0 of C(G)
is given by all elements of G. The set of morphisms C1 of C(G) is given by the
set of all pairs (X, e) where X ∈ G and e ∈ E. The source and the target of
(X, e) ∈ C1 are given by σ(X, e) = X and τ (X, e) = ∂(e)−1 X, respectively.
                                                         (X,e)
In other words, a morphism in C(G) “looks like” X −−−→ ∂(e)−1 X, which we
                               e
                               → ∂(e)−1 X. Given X ∈ G and e, f ∈ E the
will sometimes abbreviate as X −
composition
                         e         f
                     X− → ∂(e)−1 X −
                                   → ∂(f )−1 ∂(e)−1 X
is
                                      ef
                               X −→ ∂(ef )−1 X.
     The tensor product has the form:

                 ∂(e)−1 X ∂(f )−1 Y             ∂(e)−1 X∂(f )−1 Y
                    x         x                         x
                    e ⊗      f            =           (X⊲f )e ,           (8)
                                                      
                  X          Y                  XY
where X, Y ∈ G and e, f ∈ E. Therefore, the set of morphisms of C(G) is a
group under the tensor product. This group is isomorphic to the semidirect
product G ⋉ E of G and E.


                                           11
    From the definition of a crossed module, it is easy to see that we have indeed
defined a strict monoidal category which, furthermore, is a categorical group.
    We will recall in 1.3.4 how to define a crossed module from a categorical
group.

1.3     The thin fundamental categorical group of a manifold
Let M be a smooth manifold.

1.3.1   1-Tracks
Definition 15 (1-path) A 1-path is given by a smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 such that γ is constant in [0, ǫ] ∪ [1 − ǫ, 1]; in
the terminology of [CP], this can be abbreviated by saying that each end point of
γ has a sitting instant. Given a 1-path γ, define the source and target of γ as
σ(γ) = γ(0) and τ (γ) = γ(1), respectively.

    Given two 1-paths γ and φ with τ (γ) = σ(φ), their concatenation γφ is
defined in the usual way:
                                (
                                    γ(2t), if t ∈ [0, 1/2]
                      (γφ)(t) =
                                  φ(2t − 1), if t ∈ [1/2, 1]

Note that the concatenation of two 1-paths is also a 1-path. The fact that any
1-path has sitting instants at its end points needs to be used to prove this.

Definition 16 (2-paths) A 2-path Γ is given by a smooth map Γ : [0, 1]2 → M
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 for which:
  1. Γ(t, s) = Γ(0, 0) if 0 ≤ t ≤ ǫ and s ∈ [0, 1],
  2. Γ(t, s) = Γ(1, 0) if 1 − ǫ ≤ t ≤ 1 and s ∈ [0, 1],
  3. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 0) if 0 ≤ s ≤ ǫ and t ∈ [0, 1],
  4. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 1) if 1 − ǫ ≤ s ≤ 1 and t ∈ [0, 1].

   Given a 2-path Γ, define the following 1-paths:

        ∂l (Γ)(s) = Γ(0, s), s ∈ [0, 1],        ∂r (Γ)(s) = Γ(1, s), s ∈ [0, 1],
        ∂d (Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 0), t ∈ [0, 1],        ∂u (Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 1), t ∈ [0, 1].

Note that the paths ∂l (Γ) and ∂r (Γ) are necessarily constant, thus each of them
can be identified with a point of M . In addition, given a 2-path Γ then the
1-paths ∂u (Γ) and ∂d (Γ) have the same initial and end points. If x is a point of
M the constant 1- and 2-paths with value x are both denoted by x.
    If Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths such that ∂r (Γ) = ∂l (Γ′ ) their horizontal concatena-
tion Γ ◦h Γ′ is defined in the obvious way, in other words:


                                           12
                             (
                                  Γ(2t, s), if t ∈ [0, 1/2] and s ∈ [0, 1]
                  ′
           Γ ◦h Γ (t, s) =
                                 Γ′ (2t − 1, s), if t ∈ [1/2, 1] and s ∈ [0, 1]
Similarly, if ∂u (Γ) = ∂d (Γ′ ) we can define a vertical concatenation Γ ◦v Γ′ as:
                               (
                                   Γ(t, 2s), if s ∈ [0, 1/2] and t ∈ [0, 1]
                   ′
             Γ ◦v Γ (t, s) =
                                 Γ′ (t, 2s − 1), if s ∈ [1/2, 1] and t ∈ [0, 1]

   We will also represent the 2-paths Γ of M in the following suggestive way:

                                          ∂u (Γ)
                                            x
                                            
                                       Γ = Γ
                                            ∂d (Γ)

In this notation, the vertical concatenation of two 2-paths Γ and Γ′ with ∂d (Γ′ ) =
∂u (Γ) can be represented as:

                                                            ∂u (Γ′ )
                                                               x
                                                                ′
                                  ∂u (Γ ◦v Γ′ )                Γ
                                       x
                                       
                Γ ◦ v Γ′   =           Γ◦v Γ′    =    ∂d (Γ′ ) = ∂u (Γ)
                                                                x
                                                                
                                  ∂d (Γ ◦v Γ′ )                 Γ
                                                             ∂d (Γ)

Definition 17 Two 1-paths φ and γ are said to be rank-1 homotopic (and we
write φ ∼
        =1 γ) if there exists a 2-path Γ such that:
  1. ∂u (Γ) = γ and ∂d (Γ) = φ.
  2. Rank(Dv Γ) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ [0, 1]2 .
Here D denotes derivative.

In particular, if γ and φ are rank-1 homotopic, then they have the same ini-
tial and end-points. Note also that rank-1 homotopy is an equivalence rela-
tion. Given a 1-path γ, the equivalence class to which it belongs is denoted
by [γ]. Rank-1 homotopy is one of a number of notions of “thin” equivalence
between paths or loops, and was introduced in [CP], following a suggestion by
A. Machado.
    We denote the set of 1-paths of M by S1 (M ). The quotient of S1 (M ) by the
relation of thin homotopy is denoted by S1 (M ). We call the elements of S1 (M )
1-tracks. The concatenation of 1-tracks together with the source and target
maps σ, τ : S1 (M ) → M , defines a groupoid S1 (M ) whose set of morphisms is
S1 (M ) and whose set of objects is M .


                                            13
Definition 18 Let ∗ ∈ M be a base point. The group π11 (M, ∗) is defined as
being the set of 1-tracks [γ] ∈ S1 (M ) starting and ending at ∗, with the group
operation being the concatenation of paths.

It is easy to see directly that π11 (M, ∗), a thin analogue of π1 (M ), is indeed a
group. See [CP, MP] for details.

1.3.2   2-Tracks
Definition 19 Two 2-paths Γ and Γ′ are said to be rank-2 homotopic (and we
write Γ ∼
        =2 Γ′ ) if there exists a smooth map J : [0, 1]2 × [0, 1] → M such that:

  1. J(t, s, 0) = Γ(t, s), J(t, s, 1) = Γ′ (t, s) for s, t ∈ [0, 1].
  2. J is constant over {0} × [0, 1]2 and {1} × [0, 1]2 .
  3. Over [0, 1]×{0}×[0, 1] the map J : [0, 1]2 ×[0, 1] → M restricts to a rank-1
     homotopy ∂d (Γ) → ∂d (Γ′ ).
  4. J restricts to a rank-1 homotopy ∂u (Γ) → ∂u (Γ′ ) over [0, 1] × {1} × [0, 1].
  5. There exists an ǫ > 0 such that J(t, s, x) = J(t, s, 0) if x ≤ ǫ and s, t ∈
     [0, 1], and analogously for all the other faces of [0, 1]3 . We will denote this
     condition as saying that J has a product structure close to the boundary
     of [0, 1]3 .
                                            3
  6. Rank(Dv J) ≤ 2 for any v ∈ [0, 1] .

     Note that rank-2 homotopy is an equivalence relation. To prove transitivity
we need to use the penultimate condition of the previous definition. We denote
by S2 (M ) the set of all 2-paths of M . The quotient of S2 (M ) by the relation of
rank-2 homotopy is denoted by S2 (M ). We call the elements of S2 (M ) 2-tracks.
If Γ ∈ S2 (M ), we denote the equivalence class in S2 (M ) to which Γ belongs by
[Γ].

1.3.3   Horizontal and vertical compositions of 2-tracks
Note that the horizontal composition of 2-paths descends immediately to a
horizontal composition in S2 (M ). Suppose that Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths with
∂u (Γ) ∼
       =1 ∂d (Γ′ ). Choose a rank-1 homotopy J connecting ∂u (Γ) and ∂d (Γ′ ).
Then [Γ] ◦v [Γ′ ] is defined as [(Γ ◦v J) ◦v Γ′ ]. The fact that this composition is
well defined in S2 (M ) follows immediately from lemma 52 in the appendix.
    Therefore both the vertical and horizontal compositions of 2-paths descend
to S2 (M ). These compositions are obviously associative, and admit units and
inverses. Since the interchange law is trivially verified the following theorem
holds:




                                            14
Theorem 20 Let M be a smooth manifold. The horizontal and vertical com-
positions in S2 (M ) together with the boundary maps ∂u , ∂d , ∂l , ∂r : S2 (M ) →
S1 (M ) define a 2-groupoid S2 (M ), whose set of objects is given by all points of
M , the set of 1-morphisms by the set S1 (M ) of 1-tracks on M , and given two
1-tracks [γ] and [γ ′ ], the set of 2-morphisms [γ] → [γ ′ ] is given by all 2-tracks
[Γ] with ∂d ([Γ]) = [γ] and ∂u ([Γ]) = [γ ′ ].
The definition of a 2-groupoid can be found in [HKK]. This construction should
be compared with [HKK, BHKP], where the thin strict 2-groupoid of a Hausdorff
space was defined, using a different notion of thin equivalence (factoring through
a graph) - see also [BH] for the construction of the fundamental double groupoid
of a triple of spaces. For analogous non-strict constructions see [M, BS, MP].

1.3.4   Definition of the thin fundamental categorical group of a smooth
        manifold
Since S2 (M ) is a 2-category, given a base point ∗ of M (in other words an
object of S2 (M )) we can define a monoidal category P2 (M, ∗). The objects of
P2 (M, ∗) are given by all 1-tracks of M starting and ending at ∗, and therefore
by all elements of π11 (M, ∗). On the other hand, the set P2 (M, ∗) of morphisms
of P2 (M, ∗) is given by the set of all 2-tracks [Γ] ∈ S2 (M ) such that ∂l ([Γ]) =
∂r ([Γ]) = ∗. Therefore, given [γ], [γ ′ ] ∈ π11 (M, ∗), the set of morphisms [γ] →
[γ ′ ] is given by all 2-tracks [Γ] connecting [γ] and [γ ′ ], in other words with
∂d ([Γ]) = [γ] and ∂u ([Γ]) = [γ ′ ]. The composition in P2 (M, ∗) is given by the
vertical composition in S2 (M ). On the other hand the horizontal composition
of 2-tracks will give the tensor product in P2 (M, ∗).
      Given that S2 (M ) is a 2-groupoid, the monoidal category P2 (M, ∗) is a
categorical group. We therefore call P2 (M, ∗) the thin fundamental categorical
group of M .

1.3.5   The thin fundamental crossed module of a smooth manifold
Since P2 (M, ∗) is a categorical group, it defines a crossed module Π22,1 (M, ∗),
which we call the thin fundamental crossed module of M . Let us explain how
to construct Π2,1                                  2,1
              2 (M, ∗) directly. Define a group π2 (M, ∗) as being given by

                  π22,1 (M, ∗) = {[Γ] ∈ P2 (M, ∗) : ∂d ([Γ]) = [∗]}

with the product law being the horizontal composition. Note that the map
    .
∂ = ∂u : π22,1 (M, ∗) → π11 (M, ∗) is therefore a group morphism. In addition
π1 (M, ∗) acts on π22,1 (M, ∗) on the left as follows:
 1


                         [γ] ⊲ [Γ] = id[γ] ◦h [Γ] ◦h id[γ −1 ] ,

where [Γ] ∈ π22,1 (M, ∗) and [γ] ∈ π11 (M, ∗). Here if [γ] is a 1-track then id[γ]
denotes the 2-track such that id[γ] (s, t) = γ(t), where s, t ∈ [0, 1].
   The following theorem follows from the well-known equivalence between the
category of categorical groups and the category of crossed modules which was

                                           15
referred to in 1.2.1; see [BM, BL, BMo, P]. For a graphical proof see [BHS, 6.2].


Theorem 21 The boundary map ∂ : π22,1 (M, ∗) → π11 (M, ∗), together with the
left action of π11 (M, ∗) on π22,1 (M, ∗), defines a crossed module, which we denote
by Π2,1
      2 (M, ∗).

   In 1.2.1 we showed how to construct a categorical group from any crossed
module. The way we defined Π2,1 2 (M, ∗) from the categorical group P2 (M, ∗)
shows how to go in the reverse direction.

1.3.6   Two exact sequences
This subsection is not necessary to understand the rest of the article.

Definition 22 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let ∗ ∈ M . The group π22 (M, ∗)
is given by all 2-paths Γ ∈ S2 (M ) such that Γ(∂([0, 1]2 )) = {∗}, up to the equiva-
lence relation given by Γ ∼
                          = Γ′ if there exists a rank-2 homotopy             2
                                                                  J : [0, 1] × [0, 1] → M ,
                     ′                                     2
connecting Γ and Γ , such that, in addition, J (∂([0, 1] ) × I = {∗}. The group
law is taken to be the horizontal composition.

For more details see [MP].

Theorem 23 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. The crossed
module Π2,1
        2 (M, ∗) can be embedded into the exact sequence:

                           i              ∂             p
                          → π22,1 (M, ∗) −
         {0} → π22 (M, ∗) −              → π11 (M, ∗) −
                                                      → π1 (M, ∗) → {1}.

Proof. The only non-trivial part is the proof that the natural map i : π22 (M, ∗) →
π22,1 (M, ∗) is injective. This follows from Lemma 52.

Definition 24 The thin k-invariant of M is defined as being the cohomol-
ogy class kt (M, ∗) ∈ H 3 π1 (M, ∗), π22 (M, ∗) determined by the exact sequence
above. See [EML, Br] for the construction of these group cohomology classes.

    We can define a 2-category Q2 (M ), with objects given by the points of M and
morphisms given by the arrows of the groupoid S1 (M ). The set of 2-morphisms
Q2 (M ) of Q2 (M ) is given by the set of 2-paths of M up to homotopy. Here
the notion of homotopic 2-paths is defined in the same way as the notion of
rank-2 homotopic 2-paths (Definition 19), but omitting the final condition on
the rank of the derivative of the map defining the homotopy; see the remarks
after definition 36. If Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths, we write Γ ∼ =∞ Γ′ to denote that
they are homotopic. Applying the construction that defined the crossed module
Π2,1
  2 (M, ∗) to Q2 (M, ∗) yields a crossed module

                   π2∞,1 (M, ∗) = {[Γ] ∈ Q2 (M, ∗) : ∂d ([Γ]) = [∗]}

with the product law being the horizontal composition. Therefore the map
  .
∂ = ∂u : π2∞,1 (M, ∗) → π11 (M, ∗) is a group morphism.
    As before we have:

Theorem 25 The crossed module Π∞,1
                               2   (M, ∗) can be embedded into the exact
sequence:
                           i               ∂             p
                         → π2∞,1 (M, ∗) −
         {0} → π2 (M, ∗) −              → π11 (M, ∗) −
                                                     → π1 (M, ∗) → {1}.

It is easy to show that the cohomology class k(M, ∗) ∈ H 3 (π1 (M, ∗), π2 (M, ∗))
given by this exact sequence coincides with the k-invariant of M . This follows
from the explicit construction of it in [EML], and also from the no-free-lunch
principle.


2      Two-dimensional holonomies
2.1     Categorical connections
Definition 26 Let G be a Lie group. Let M be a smooth manifold. Let P → M
be a smooth principal bundle with structure group G. Denote the right action of
G on P as g ∈ G 7→ Rg ∈ diff(M ). Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed
module, where ⊲ is a Lie group left action of G on E by automorphisms. Let also
G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed module. A G-categorical
connection on P is a pair (ω, m), where ω is a connection 1-form on P , i.e.
ω ∈ A1 (P, g) is a 1-form on P with values in g such that:
    1. Rg∗ (ω) = g −1 ωg, ∀g ∈ G,

    2. ω(A# ) = A, ∀A ∈ g;
and m ∈ A2 (P, e) is a 2-form on P with values in e, the Lie algebra of E, such
that:
    1. The 2-form m is G-equivariant. In other words we have Rg∗ (m) = g −1 ⊲ m
       for each g ∈ G.
    2. The 2-form m is horizontal, in other words:

                    m(X, Y ) = m(X H , Y H ), for each X, Y ∈ X(P ).

       In particular m(Xu , Yu ) = 0 if either of the vectors Xu , Yu ∈ Tu P is
       vertical, where u ∈ P . Here the map X ∈ X(P ) 7→ X H ∈ X(P ) denotes
       the horizontal projection of vector fields on P with respect to the connection
       1-form ω.


                                          17
Finally we require that
                                           ∂(m) = Ω                                             (9)
where Ω ∈ A2 (P, g) is the curvature 2-form of ω.

This last condition is of course equivalent to the vanishing of the fake curvature
of [BS, BrMe]; see 2.2.4.
Example 27 Let P be any principal G-bundle with a connection 1-form ω.
Let Ω be the curvature 2-form of ω. If G = (id : G → G, ⊲), where ⊲ is the
adjoint action of G on G, then (ω, Ω) is a G-categorical connection on P . More
generally we can take G to be given by the universal covering map E → G of G;
see example 9.

2.2     The 2-curvature 3-form of a G-categorical connection
Recall the definition of the curvature 2-form Ω of a connection 1-form ω as the
covariant exterior derivative of the 1-form ω.

Definition 28 (2-Curvature) Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed mod-
ule, and let P → M be a smooth principal G-bundle. The 2-curvature 3-form
of a G-categorical connection (ω, m) on P is defined as

                                  M = dm ◦ (H × H × H).

In other words:
                             M(A, B, C) = dm(AH , B H , C H ),
where A, B, C ∈ X(P ) are smooth vector fields on P .

2.2.1     Algebraic preliminaries
Let M be a smooth manifold. Consider a differential crossed module G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲).
In particular the map (X, e) ∈ g × e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is bilinear.
   Let a ∈ An (M, g) and b ∈ Am (M, e) be g- and e-valued (respectively) differ-
ential forms on M . We define a ⊗⊲ b as being the e-valued covariant tensor field
on M such that

(a⊗⊲ b)(A1 , . . . , An , B1 , . . . Bm ) = a(A1 , . . . , An )⊲b(B1 , . . . , Bm ); Ai , Bj ∈ X(M ).

We also define an alternating tensor field a ∧⊲ b ∈ An+m (M, e), being given by
                                          (n + m)!
                               a ∧⊲ b =            Alt(a ⊗⊲ b).
                                            n!m!
Here Alt denotes the natural projection from the vector space of e-valued co-
variant tensor fields on M onto the vector space of e-valued differential forms
on M .
   For example, if a ∈ A1 (M, g) and b ∈ A2 (M, e), then a ∧⊲ b satisfies:

   (a ∧⊲ b)(X, Y, Z) = a(X) ⊲ b(Y, Z) + a(Y ) ⊲ b(Z, X) + a(Z) ⊲ b(X, Y ),                     (10)

                                                18
where X, Y, Z ∈ X(M ).
  Note that the formula:

                        d(a ∧⊲ b) = da ∧⊲ b + (−1)n a ∧⊲ db,

where a ∈ An (M, g) and b ∈ Am (M, e), holds trivially.
    As as example of this notation, let P → M be a principal G-bundle over
the manifold M . Let ω ∈ A1 (P, g) be a connection 1-form on M . Then the
structure equation for the curvature form Ω = Dω of ω can be written as:
                                         1
                                 Ω = dω + ω ∧ad ω,
                                         2
where ad denotes the adjoint action of g on g. Furthermore the Bianchi identity
can be written as:
                              dΩ + ω ∧ad Ω = 0;
see 1.1.2.

2.2.2    The 2-structure equation
The following equation is an analogue of Cartan’s structure equation. It will be
of prime importance later.
Proposition 29 (2-Structure Equation) Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed
module. Let P be a principal G-bundle over the manifold M . Let also (ω, m) be
a categorical G-connection on P . We have: M = dm+ω ∧⊲ m, where M = Dm
is the 2-curvature 3-form of (ω, m). In particular the 2-curvature 3-form M is
G-equivariant, in other words: Rg∗ (M) = g −1 ⊲ M, for each g ∈ G.
   The proof of the 2-structure equation follows directly from the following
lemma.

Lemma 30 Let a be a G-equivariant horizontal (n − 1)-form in P . Then Da =
da + ω ∧⊲ a.
Proof. Let X 1 , . . . , X n ∈ Tu P , extended to a neighbourhood of u ∈ P .
If all vectors are horizontal it follows that Da(X 1 , . . . , X n ) = (da + ω ∧⊲
a)(X 1 , . . . , X n ), since ω is vertical. Suppose that one of the vectors, which
we can suppose to be X 1 , is vertical. We need to prove that (da + ω ∧⊲
a)(X 1 , . . . , X n ) = 0. Choose A ∈ g such that A#                    1
                                                                 u = Xu . By using Car-
tan’s magic formula together with the fact that a is horizontal it follows that
da(A# , X 2 , . . . , X n ) = (LA# a)(X 2 , . . . X n ), where L denotes Lie derivative.
Since a is G-equivariant it follows that LA# a = −A ⊲ a. However, (ω ∧⊲
a)(A# , X 2 , . . . , X n ) = ω(A# ) ⊲ a(X 2 , . . . , X n ), since a is horizontal. Note
ω(A# ) = A.




                                           19
2.2.3   The 2-Bianchi identity
Fix a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). Let P be a smooth principal G-
bundle over M with a connection ω. Choose a G-categorical connection (ω, m)
on P .

Proposition 31 (2-Bianchi identity) Let M ∈ A3 (P, e) be the 2-curvature
3-form of (ω, m). Then the exterior covariant derivative DM of M vanishes.
In other words:
                       dM ◦ (H × H × H × H) = 0,
which by lemma 30 is the same as:

                               dM + ω ∧⊲ M = 0.

    Proof. Let us prove the second form of the 2-Bianchi identity. By the
2-structure equation it follows that:

dM = ddm+d(ω ∧⊲ m) = dω ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ dm = dω ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M + ω ∧⊲ (ω ∧⊲ m) .

Given that ω ∧⊲ (ω ∧⊲ m) = 21 (ω ∧ad ω) ∧⊲ m we can conclude:
          1
dM = (dω + ω ∧ad ω) ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M = Ω ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M = ∂(m) ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M.
          2
We now prove that ∂(m) ∧⊲ m = 0. Since G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) is a differential
crossed module we have, for any vector fields X, Y, Z, W ∈ X(P ):
                                       
   ∂(m)(X, Y ) ⊲ m(Z, W ) = ∂ m(X, Y ) ⊲ m(Z, W ) = [m(X, Y ), m(Z, W )].

Let us see that Alt[m, m] = 0, which implies that ∂(m) ∧⊲ m = 0. The
permutation r such that r(X, Y, Z, W ) = (Z, W, X, Y ) is even. In particular
Alt([m, m]) = Alt([m, m] ◦ r). However, [m, m] ◦ r = −[m, m].

2.2.4   Local form of a categorical connection
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be some Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲)
be the associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M and
a smooth principal G-bundle P → M , with a categorical G-connection (ω, m),
where, as usual, ω ∈ A1 (P, g) and m ∈ A2 (P, e).
   The local form of the categorical G-connection (ω, m) is similar to the local
form of a connection. Let {Uα } be an open covering of the manifold M . We can
suppose that each Uα is contractible and that, for each α and β, the intersection
Uα ∩ Uβ is contractible; see [BT]. Therefore, for each α, the restriction Pα of
P to Uα is trivial, and, in particular, it admits a section fα : Uα → Pα . The
local form of a categorical G-connection is therefore given by the family of forms
ωa = fα∗ (ω) and mα = fα∗ (m).
   For each α, by the structure equation, the local curvature form Ωα = fα∗ (Ω)
takes the form
                                         1
                             Ωα = dωα + ωα ∧ad ωα .
                                         2

                                       20
Locally, the Bianchi identity reads:
                             dΩα + ωα ∧ad Ωα = 0.
Analogously, from the 2-structure equation, locally in each Uα , the 2-curvature
3-form Mα = fα∗ (M) takes the form:
                            Mα = dmα + ωα ∧⊲ mα ,
and the 2-Bianchi identity reads:
                             dMα + ωα ∧⊲ Mα = 0.
These local expressions correspond to the formulae in [B] when the fake curva-
ture vanishes.
   Let φα,β : Ua ∩ Uβ → G be defined as fα (x)φα,β (x) = fβ (x), for each x ∈
Uα ∩ Uβ . We have:
                       ωβ (X) = φ−1              −1
                                 α,β ω(X)φα,β + φα,β dφα,β ,                (11)
                    Ωβ (X, Y ) = φ−1
                                  α,β Ω(X, Y )φα,β ,                        (12)
for each X, Y ∈ X(M ). Since both m and M are G-equivariant and horizontal,
it follows that for each α, β:
                                       −1
                         mβ (X, Y ) = φα,β ⊲ mα (X, Y ),                    (13)
                      Mβ (X, Y, Z) = φ−1
                                      α,β ⊲ Mα (X, Y, Z),                   (14)
for each X, Y, Z ∈ X(M ).
Lemma 32 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie
crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed
module. Suppose π : P → M is the trivial bundle M × G. Given m0 ∈ A2 (M, e)
and ω0 ∈ A1 (M, g), such that ∂(m0 ) = Ω0 = dω0 + 12 ω0 ∧ad ω0 , there exists a
categorical G-connection (ω, m) on P such that its local form is (ω0 , m0 ).
Proof. Let θ be the canonical g-valued left-invariant 1-form on G; see 2.4.2.
Then ω = g −1 π ∗ (ω0 )g + θ is a connection 1-form on M × G, and its local form,
considering the section f : M → P such that, for each x ∈ M , f (x) = (x, 1G ),
is ω0 . The 2-form π ∗ (m0 ) ∈ A2 (P, e) is horizontal. However, it is not G-
equivariant. Therefore we define m ∈ A2 (M × G, e) as being such that, given
X, Y ∈ T(x,g) P , we have:
                        m(X, Y ) = g −1 ⊲ π ∗ (m0 )(X, Y ),
where g ∈ G, x ∈ M and X, Y ∈ T(x,g) M × G. This 2-form is obviously smooth
and horizontal. Moreover, given X, Y ∈ T(x,g) P it follows that:
                   (Rh∗ m)(X, Y ) = m(Xh, Y h)
                                 = (gh)−1 ⊲ π ∗ (m0 )(Xh, Y h)
                                 = h−1 g −1 ⊲ π ∗ (m0 )(X, Y )
                                 = h−1 ⊲ m(X, Y ).


                                        21
Therefore m is G-equivariant. Let Ω be the curvature of ω. Then Ω(X, Y ) =
g −1 π ∗ (Ω0 )(X, Y )g, where as before X, Y ∈ T(x,g) P . In particular it follows that
Ω = ∂(m).
    The following follows from the previous discussion.
Corollary 33 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be
a Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential
crossed module. Let {Uα } be an open cover of M , such that the restriction Pα
of P to Uα is the trivial bundle. Let also fα : Uα → Pα be local sections of
P . Define φα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → G as fα (x)φα,β (x) = fβ (x). Suppose that for
each α we are given forms ωα ∈ A1 (Uα , g) and mα ∈ A2 (Uα , e), satisfying
∂(mα ) = Ωα = dωα + 12 ωα ∧ad ωα . Moreover, suppose that for each α, β with
Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅ equations (11) and (13) are satisfied. There exists a unique cat-
egorical connection (ω, m) on P such that the forms ωα and mα are its local
form.
    The trivial bundle M × G → M always admits the trivial categorical con-
nection, whose local form is given by the forms ω0 = 0 and m0 = 0. However,
there exist several other examples for the trivial bundle. Let A = ∂(E), and let
a be its Lie algebra. There exists a linear map r : a → e such that ∂ ◦ r = ida .
Let ω0 be any a-valued 1-form on M . Let Ω0 be the curvature of ω0 and define
m0 = r(Ω0 ). Then (ω0 , m0 ) is the local form of a categorical G-connection on
M × G. In fact, let B = ker ∂ ⊂ E. Therefore B is closed under the action of G
on E, by the first condition of the definition of crossed modules; see definition
3. Let b be the Lie algebra of B. Given any b-valued 2-form ρ0 on M then
ρ0 + m0 is the local form of a categorical G-connection on M × G.
    It is not a trivial problem whether there always exists a categorical G-
connection on any principal G-bundle. This issue is very likely to depend on the
topology of the manifold. The strategy of combining locally defined connection
1-forms ω using a partition of unity cannot be carried through for the 2-forms
m, since ∂(m) = Ω, which is not C∞ -linear in ω.

2.3     Categorical holonomy
2.3.1   Definition of a holonomy.
The following definition appears in [CP].
Definition 34 (Holonomy) Let M and N be smooth manifolds. Suppose that
M has a chosen base point ∗. A map F : π11 (M, ∗) → N is said to be smooth if,
for any 2-path Γ : [0, 1]2 → M, with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗, the map

                              s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F ([γs ]) ∈ N

is smooth. Here Γ(t, s) = γs (t), where s, t ∈ [0, 1].
     Let G be a Lie group. A holonomy is, by definition, a smooth group morphism
π11 (M, ∗) → G.
   The following result appears in [CP].

                                          22
Theorem 35 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. Let also G
be a Lie group. Let P → M be a smooth principal G-bundle over M with a
connection ω. Let u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P at ∗. Then the parallel transport of ω
                         1
determines a holonomy F(ω,u)  : π11 (M, ∗) → G.

Proof. Recall the notation of 1.1.3. Given a 1-path γ : [0, 1] → M , with
                          1
γ(0), γ(1) = ∗, define F(ω,u)  (γ) to be the unique element of G such that u =
             1
Hω (γ, 1, u)F(ω,u) (γ). Then, if Γ is a 2-path, with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗, it follows
that the map
                                           1
                            s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F(ω,u) (γs ) ∈ G,
where Γ(t, s) = γs (t); s, t ∈ [0, 1], is smooth. This follows from the fact that the
map t ∈ [0, 1] 7→ Hω (γs , t, u) is a solution of a differential equation in t. This
differential equation depends smoothly on s if Γ is smooth. For details see [KN,
page 74].
                     1
    The fact that F(ω,u)   descends to a map π11 (M, ∗) → G follows from lemma 2
and the fact that the horizontal lift of vectors defines a linear map. Finally the
            1
fact that F(ω,u) is a group morphism follows from the fact that Hω γ 2 γ 1 , 1, u =
                        
Hω γ , 1, Hω (γ , 1, u) , for any smooth curves γ 1 and γ 2 in M starting and
       1         2

ending at ∗.
    It is proved in [CP] that any holonomy π11 (M, ∗) → G arises from a bundle
with connection in this way.

2.3.2    Definition of a categorical holonomy
Definition 36 (3-path) Let M be a manifold. A smooth map J : [0, 1]3 → M ,
say J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s) = γsx (t), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1], is said to be a 3-path if:
   1. J is constant over {0} × [0, 1]2 and over {1} × [0, 1]2 .
   2. J restricts to a rank-1 homotopy (connecting γ00 with γ01 ) over [0, 1]×{0}×
      [0, 1] and over [0, 1] × {1} × [0, 1] (connecting γ10 with γ11 ).
   3. J has a product structure close to the boundary of [0, 1]3 ; see definition
      19.

In particular J defines a homotopy connecting the 2-paths Γ0 and Γ1 ; see 1.3.6.
Note that it is not necessarily a rank-2 homotopy.
Definition 37 Let M and N be smooth manifolds. Consider the projection
map S2 (M ) → S2 (M ). A map F : S2 (M ) → N is said to be smooth if, for any
3-path J, the map
                         x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F ([Γx ]) ∈ N
is smooth. Here J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s), for each (t, s, x) ∈ [0, 1]3 .
   Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Consider the categorical
group C(G) constructed from G, see 1.2.1. Its set of objects is G and its set
of morphisms is the semidirect product G ⋉ E of G and E; all of these are

                                           23
smooth manifolds. The following definition extends the definition of holonomy
for principal G-bundles of [CP] and should be compared with analogous non-
strict constructions in [BS, MP, M].
Definition 38 (Categorical holonomy) Let M be a smooth manifold. Choose
an element ∗ ∈ M . A categorical holonomy is, by definition, a strict monoidal
functor (in other words a categorical group morphism) F : P2 (M, ∗) → C(G),
such that the associated maps F1 : π11 (M ) → G and F2 : P2 (M, ∗) → G ⋉ E on
the sets of objects and morphisms of P2 (M, ∗) are smooth. Here P2 (M, ∗) is the
thin fundamental categorical group of M ; see 1.3.4.
    If we use the notation
                     ∂u ([Γ])                                       ∂(e)−1 X

               [Γ] = [Γ]                  and             (X, e) =    

to denote the morphisms of P2 (M, ∗) and of C(G), then the tensor product of
two elements [Γ] and [Γ′ ] of P2 (M, ∗) can be presented in the suggestive form:
                    ∂u ([Γ])           ∂u ([Γ′ ])           ∂u ([Γ])∂u ([Γ′ ])

In this notation, the condition that a functor F = (F1 , F2 ) : P2 (M, ∗) → C(G)
be a strict monoidal functor means that:

                                             e
C(G) is sometimes simply denoted by g −     → ∂(e−1 )g, where g ∈ G and e ∈ E.
    Since the category of crossed modules and the category of categorical groups
are equivalent, we can give an alternative definition of a categorical holonomy,
and define it as being a smooth crossed module map

where the notion of a smooth crossed module map is the obvious one. Here
Π2,1
  2 (M, ∗) is the thin fundamental crossed module of the smooth manifold M ;
see 1.3.5.

2.4     Categorical connections and categorical connection holonomies
The aim of this subsection is to prove the following main theorem.

Theorem 39 Let G be a Lie group. Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also P →
M be a smooth principal fibre bundle with structure group G. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)
be a Lie crossed module. A G-categorical connection (ω, m) on P together with
an element u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P over ∗ ∈ M , determines a categorical holonomy
F(ω,m,u) : P2 (M, ∗) → C(G), which we call a categorical connection holonomy,
since it arises from a categorical connection.

    For the rest of this subsection, fix a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲),
and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed module. Consider
also a smooth manifold M and a principal G-bundle P over M , as well as a G-
categorical connection (ω, m) on P .

2.4.1   Defining a categorical holonomy from a categorical connection
Consider a base point ∗ ∈ M . Choose also u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P at ∗. To
describe F(ω,m,u) on the set π11 (M, ∗) of objects of P2 (M, ∗), we use theorem 35.
Therefore we define:
                 1                1
                F(ω,m,u) ([γ]) = F(ω,u) ([γ]), where [γ] ∈ π11 (M, ∗).           (18)

     Let now Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗. Let γs (t) = Γ(t, s); s, t ∈
                     2
[0, 1]. To define F(ω,m,u) , consider the smooth function s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ eΓ (s) ∈ E,
which solves the following differential equation in E:
                                 Z 1                     !

with initial condition eΓ (0) = 1E . Set eΓ = eΓ (1) to be the element of E assigned
to the 2-path Γ. Then we define:
                         2
                                       

    Recall the elements gγs ∈ G, where s ∈ [0, 1], which are given by the
                                                      1
condition: ugγs = Hω (γs , 1, u); see 1.1.4. Thus F(ω,m,u)   ([γs ]) = gγ−1
                                                                          s

   We will prove that F(ω,m,u) = F(ω,m,u)    , F(ω,m,u) defines a categorical
holonomy P2 (M, ∗) → C(G). Explicitly, we need to prove that the assignment:

where Γ is a 2-path in M such that ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗, and Γ(t, s) = γs (t); ∀s, t ∈
[0, 1], depends only on the rank-2 homotopy class to which Γ belongs, and defines
a monoidal functor P2 (M, ∗) → C(G), such that the induced maps on the set of
objects and morphisms of P2 (M, ∗) are smooth.
     First of all:
Lemma 40 Let Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗. Then for each
s ∈ [0, 1] we have: gγ0 ∂(eΓ (s)) = gγs . Here Γ(t, s) = γs (t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. The previous equation holds for s = 0, by definition of eΓ (s). We have:
                                                               

therefore:

                                                                              Hω (γs ,t,u)

since ∂(m) = Ω. By equation (7) we also have:
                                Z 1                           !
                 d                        ∂^ ∂^
                   g γ = g γs         Ω      γs (t), γs (t)                      .
                 ds s            0        ∂t        ∂s

Thus both sides of the equation are solutions of the same differential equation
in G, and have the same initial condition.
     We remark that, using the terminology of [BS], this result corresponds to
the condition that a local pre-2-holonomy gives rise to a local true 2-holonomy,
which there also follows from the vanishing of the fake curvature.
     Let Γ : [0, 1]2 → M be a 2-path in M with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗. We need
                    2
to prove that F(ω,m,u)     (Γ) depends only on the 2-track defined by Γ, in other
words on the rank-2 homotopy class of 2-paths to which Γ belongs. This will
be shown shortly in Corollary 43 of Theorem 42. For now, consider a 3-path J,
where J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s); ∀t, s, x ∈ [0, 1], defining a homotopy (not necessarily
rank-2) connecting the 2-paths Γ0 and Γ1 . Suppose that ∂l (Γ0 ), ∂r (Γ0 ) = ∗,
                                                       ∂
thus ∂l (Γ1 ), ∂r (Γ1 ) = ∗. We want to calculate ∂x     eΓx (s), where s, x ∈ [0, 1].
     In fact, for later applications, we will consider the more general case when,
for each x ∈ [0, 1], we have that ∂l (Γx ) = q(x) and ∂r (Γx ) = q(x), where
q : [0, 1] → M is a smooth map. This generality will be important to define
Wilson spheres in 2.5.3. The lemma in the following subsection will be useful
for our purpose.

    Let θ be the canonical g-valued 1-form on G. Thus θ is left invariant and
satisfies θ(A) = A, ∀A ∈ g, being defined uniquely by these properties. Also

2.4.3    The dependence of the surface holonomy on a smooth family
         of surfaces
The discussion in this subsection will be very similar to that of 1.1.4. We want
to prove an analogue of lemma 2 for the surface holonomy of a family of 2-paths
Γx .
     Consider a smooth map J : [0, 1]3 → M , where J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s); ∀t, s, x ∈
[0, 1]. Given x, s ∈ [0, 1], a smooth curve γsx : [0, 1] → M is defined as γsx (t) =

                                           27
J(t, s, x), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose that, for each x ∈ [0, 1], there exists
q(x) ∈ M such that J(0, s, x) = J(1, s, x) = q(x) for each s ∈ [0, 1]. In other
words ∂l (Γx ) = ∂r (Γx ) = q(x). Note that the map x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ q(x) ∈ M is
necessarily smooth. Let q(0) = ∗ ∈ M . Choose u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P at ∗. Let
also ux = Hω (q, x, u), where x ∈ [0, 1]. In particular u0 = u.
    Note that the conditions above imply that:

         Rank(D(s,x) J)(t,s,x) ≤ 1 if t = 0 or t = 1, for each s, x ∈ [0, 1].      (22)

Suppose that we also have:

         Rank(D(t,x) J)(t,s,x) ≤ 1 if s = 0 or s = 1, for each t, x ∈ [0, 1].      (23)

    For each x ∈ [0, 1], let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ eΓx (s) ∈ E be the solution of the
differential equation in E:
                                 Z 1                      !

               eΓx (s) = eΓx (s)     m   γ x (t), γsx (t)       dt,      (24)

with initial condition:
                              eΓx (0) = 1E , ∀x ∈ [0, 1].                          (25)
See equation (19). Our purpose is to calculate the x-dependence of eΓx =
                                                           d
eΓx (1), the element of E assigned to Γx , by calculating dx eΓx . The result of this
calculation, Theorem 42, is entirely analogous to Lemma 2, with the 2-curvature
3-form M replacing the curvature 2-form Ω.

   Let us analyse Ax and Bx separately. Consider the map f : [0, 1]3 → P such
that f (x, s, t) = Hω (γsx , t, ux ), for each x, s, t ∈ [0, 1]. This map is smooth; see

The first equation follows by definition of eΓx (s), the second since the e-valued
2-form dθ on E is left invariant (since θ is left invariant) and the third by the
well-known formula (21). Finally, the last equation follows since (∂ : e → g, ⊲)
is a differential crossed module.
    By lemma 40, we also have that gγ0x ∂(eΓx (s)) = gγsx , for each s, x ∈ [0, 1].

Due to the fact that (∂ : e → g, ⊲) is a differential crossed module, given e, f ∈ e
we have: ∂(e) ⊲ f = [e, f ] = −[f, e] = −∂(f ) ⊲ e. If we use this together with the
fact that Ω(X, Y ) and m(X, Y ) vanish if either of the vectors X or Y is vertical



                                                   30

    The following is a 2-dimensional version of Lemma 2.
Theorem 42 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie
crossed module. Let P → M be a principal G-bundle over M . Consider a G-
categorical connection (ω, m) on P . Let J : [0, 1]3 → M be a smooth map. Let
J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s) = γsx (t); ∀t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose that ∂l (Γx ) = ∂r (Γx ) =
q(x), ∀x ∈ [0, 1], where q : [0, 1] → M is a smooth curve. Choose u ∈ Pq(0) , the
fibre of P at q(0). Let also ux = Hω (q, x, u), where x ∈ [0, 1]. In particular
u0 = u.
    Consider the map (s, x) ∈ [0, 1]2 7→ eΓx (s) ∈ E defined by equations (24)
and (25). Let eΓx = eΓx (1). For each x ∈ [0, 1], we have:

by equations (28) and (29). Comparing with equation (27), yields theorem 42.

    From this theorem and the fact that the horizontal lift X 7→ Xe of vector
fields on M defines a linear map X(M ) → X(P ) we obtain the following:
Corollary 43 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. Let also
G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let P → M be a principal G-
bundle over M , and let u ∈ P∗ , the fibre at ∗ ∈ M . Consider a G-categorical

connection (ω, m) on P . Let Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗. Let

Γ(t, s) = γs (t), for each t, s ∈ [0, 1]. Then F(ω,m,u) (Γ) = (gγ−1

                                                                    , eΓ ) depends only
on the rank-2 homotopy class of 2-tracks [Γ] to which Γ belongs.
    Consider a crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). Let the categorical group it
defines be C(G); see 1.2.1. Let also be given a smooth manifold M with a base
point ∗, a principal G-bundle P over M and G-categorical connection (ω, m) on
                         1
P . We defined maps F(ω,m,u)    : π11 (M, ∗) → G (the sets of objects of P(M, ∗) and
of C(G), respectively) and F(ω,m,u) : P2 (M, ∗) → G ⋉ E (the sets of morphisms
                               2

of P(M, ∗) and C(G), respectively). We now prove that this assignment, defined
in 2.4.1, is a categorical holonomy. This will complete the proof of theorem 39.

2.4.4   Re-scaling
Let Γ be a 2-path in M such that ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = ∗. As usual put Γ(t, s) =
γs (t); s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Consider a smooth map f : [a, b] → [0, 1], where −∞ < a <
b < +∞. We suppose that f (a) = 0 and f (b) = 1. Let Γ′ (s, t) = γs′ (t) be such
that γs′ (t) = γf (s) (t), where s ∈ [a, b] and t ∈ [0, 1]. Even though Γ′ is not a
2-path, for its domain is [0, 1] × [a, b], the elements gγs′ ∈ E and eΓ′ (s) ∈ E,
where s ∈ [a, b], defined in 2.4.1, still make sense.
Lemma 44 We have

                       gγs′ = gγf (s)       and    eΓ′ (s) = eΓ (f (s)),

for each s ∈ [a, b].
Proof. The first equation follows since γs′ = γf (s) , as curves [0, 1] → M , for
each s ∈ [a, b]. As for the second one we have:
                         Z 1                             !
    d                             ∂^ ′

       eΓ′ (s) = eΓ′ (s)     m      Γ (t, s), Γ (t, s)                   dt
    ds                     0     ∂t          ∂s
                                                           Hω (γs′ ,t,u)
                               Z 1                                     !
                         d              ∂Γ^             ∂Γ^
              = eΓ′ (s) f (s)      m        (t, f (s)),    (t, f (s))       dt.
                        ds      0        ∂t             ∂s
                                                                            Hω (γf (s) ,t,u)

Whereas:
                                    Z 1                                          !
 d                         d                      ∂Γ^            ∂Γ^
    eΓ (f (s)) = eΓ (f (s)) f (s)           m        (t, f (s)),    (t, f (s))                          dt.
 ds                        ds           0         ∂t             ∂s
                                                                                     Hω (γf (s) ,t,u)


Therefore s 7→ eΓ′ (s) and s 7→ eΓ (f (s)) are both solutions of the same differential
equation and they have the same initial conditions.

2.4.5    Verification of the axioms for a categorical holonomy
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the
associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M with a base
point ∗, a principal G-bundle P over M and an element u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P
over ∗. Consider a categorical connection (ω, m) on P . Let us prove that the
assignments
                         [γ] ∈ π11 (M, ∗) 7→ F(ω,u)
                                              1
                                                    ([γ]) ∈ G
and
                                            2
                        [Γ] ∈ P2 (M, ∗) 7→ F(ω,m,u) ([Γ]) ∈ G ⋉ E,
defined in 2.4.1, yield a categorical holonomy F(ω,m,u) : P(M, ∗) → C(G). To
begin with, let us see that F(ω,m,u) defines a monoidal functor P2 (M, ∗) → C(G).
Here C(G) is the categorical group constructed from G; see 1.2.1.
    Claim: F(ω,m,u) is a functor.
    Proof. Recall that the source and target maps in a category are denoted
by σ and τ , respectively. Let Γ be a 2-path in M such that ∂l (Γ), ∂r (Γ) = ∗.
As usual put Γ(t, s) = γs (t); t, s ∈ [0, 1]. We have:
                                                 
                   2
              σ F(ω,m,u)  ([Γ]) = σ gγ−1   0
                                             , e[Γ] = gγ−1
                                                         0
                                                           = F1 (σ([Γ])) .

On the other hand by lemma 40:
                                    
          2
      τ F(ω,m,u) ([Γ]) = τ gγ−1
                              0
                                , e[Γ] = ∂(e−1  −1    −1
                                            Γ )gγ0 = gγ1 = F1 (τ ([Γ])).


Therefore we can represent F(ω,m,u) as:

             ∂u ([Γ])                         gγ−1
                                                 1
                                                   = ∂(eΓ )−1 gγ−1
                                                                 0
                x                                     x
                [Γ]                                  e
                 ∈ P2 (M, ∗)          7−→            Γ           ∈ C(G),
             ∂d ([Γ])                                gγ−1
                                                        0


where, as usual, Γ(t, s) = γs (t); s, t ∈ [0, 1].
    Let Γ1 and Γ2 be 2-paths in M with ∂l (Γ1 ), ∂r (Γ1 ) = ∗ and ∂l (Γ2 ), ∂r (Γ2 ) =
∗. Suppose also that ∂u (Γ1 ) = ∂d (Γ2 ). For each s, t ∈ [0, 1], put Γ1 (t, s) = γs1 (t)
and Γ2 (t, s) = γs2 (t). Let Γ = Γ1 ◦v Γ2 . Put Γ(t, s) = γs (t); s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose
s ∈ [0, 1/2]. We have:
                                 Z 1                      !
              d                           ∂^ ∂^
                 eΓ (s) = eΓ (s)     m      γs (t), γs (t)              dt.

By lemma 44, eΓ (1/2) = eΓ1 . Let e′Γ (s) = eΓ (1/2)−1 eΓ (s), where s ∈ [1/2, 1].
Then:                                                 !

                                             34
Since e′Γ (1/2) = 1E , it follows, by lemma 44, that e′Γ = eΓ2 . Putting everything
together yields eΓ = eΓ1 eΓ2 . Therefore we have:

given any two elements [Γ1 ] and [Γ2 ] of P2 (M, ∗), with ∂d (Γ2 ) = ∂u (Γ1 ).
    If we are given elements [Γ1 ] and [Γ2 ] of P2 (M, ∗), such that ∂d ([Γ2 ]) =
∂u ([Γ1 ]), then, for some representatives Γ11 ∈ [Γ1 ] and Γ21 ∈ [Γ2 ]) we have
∂d (Γ21 ) = ∂u (Γ11 ). For example, take a rank-1 homotopy H connecting ∂u (Γ1 )
with ∂d (Γ2 ), and put Γ11 = Γ1 ◦v H and Γ21 = Γ2 . Hence F(ω,m,u) : P2 (M, ∗) →
C(G) is a functor.
    Claim: F(ω,m,u) is a monoidal functor.
    Proof. Let Γ1 and Γ2 be 2-paths in P2 (M, ∗). Let also Γ = Γ1 ◦h Γ2 . Put
Γ1 (s, t) = γs1 (t), Γ2 (s, t)= γs2 (t) andΓ(s, t) = γs (t). Here s, t ∈ [0, 1]. We want

     We have therefore proven that F(ω,m,u) : P2 (M, ∗) → C(G) is a monoidal
functor, and therefore a categorical group map.
     Claim: The functor F(ω,m,u) : P2 (M, ∗) → C(G) is smooth both on the sets
π11 (M, ∗) and P2 (M, ∗) of objects and morphisms of P2 (M, ∗).
     Proof. This follows directly from the definition of F(ω,m,u) , and from the
lemma on page 74 of [KN].
     The proof of theorem 39 is complete.

2.4.6    2-Bundles
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let the associated differential
crossed module be G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲). Fix a smooth manifold M and a smooth
principal G-bundle π : P → M .
      A natural weakening of the notion of a categorical connection (ω, m) in P is
to consider m to be only locally defined on P , but so that ∂(mi ) = Ω, for any
i. Here mi ∈ A2 (Pi , e), where Pi = π −1 (Ui ) and {Ui } is an open cover of P .
This can be done by using the general theory of 2-bundles [BS], or non-abelian
gerbes [BrMe], which correspond to 2-bundles with structure crossed modules
of the form G = Aut(E) of example 11.
      To this end, let {Ui } be an open cover of M . We can suppose that, for any
                                                      .
i1 , . . . , in , the n-fold intersection Ui1 ,...,in = Ui1 ∩ . . . ∩ Uin is contractible. A G-
2-bundle can be described by using smooth maps gij : Uij → G and hijk : Uijk →
E. These have to satisfy the cocycle conditions: ∂(h−1          ijk )gij gjk = gik and hijk hikl =
(gij ⊲ hjkl ) hijl for any i, j, k, l. Therefore a G-2-bundle does not necessarily de-
fine a G-principal bundle, unless ∂(hijk ) = 1 for each i, j, k. If this condition is
satisfied, a G-2-bundle will be called a special G-2-bundle.
      The main purpose of this article was the construction of categorical holonomies,
in other words of smooth categorical group maps P2 (M, ∗) → C(G), or, equiva-
lently of smooth crossed module maps Π2,1           2 (M, ∗) → G; see 1.3 for this notation.
From the point of view of 2-dimensional holonomy, G-2-bundles are natural ob-
jects; see [BS]. However, our notion of categorical holonomy requires the exis-
tence of a smooth group morphism π11 (M, ∗) → G, and therefore of a principal
G-bundle with connection; see [CP]. This makes it natural to work with special
G-2-bundles.
      A special G-2-bundle with connection can be specified by the following data:
(Here A = ker(∂) ⊂ E, and a is its Lie algebra; note that A is central in E).
   1. A principal G-bundle π : P → M with a connection ω.



                                              37
   2. An open cover {Ui } of M such that for any i1 , . . . , in the n-fold intersection
      Ui1 ,...,in is contractible. Let Pi1 ,...,in = π −1 (Ui1 ,...,in ).
   3. G-equivariant A-valued functions eijk : Pijk → A. These are required to
      satisfy: eijk eikl = ejkl eijl .
   4. G-equivariant horizontal 2-forms mi ∈ A2 (Pi , e). These are required to
      satisfy ∂(mi ) = Ω, the curvature 2-form of ω.
   5. G-equivariant horizontal 1-forms ηij ∈ A1 (Pij , a). These are required to
      satisfy:
                                              
               mi − mj = Dηij and         De−1
                                            ijk eijk = ηij + ηjk − ηik ,

      where D denotes the exterior covariant derivative with respect to ω, in
      other words, by using lemma 30,
                                                       
      mi −mj = dηij +ω∧⊲ ηij and        de−1       ⊲ −1
                                          ijk + ω ∧ eijk eijk = ηij +ηjk −ηik .


One passes from this setting to the setting in [BS] by choosing local sections fi
of Pi , and defining the functions gij : Uij → G in the usual way: fi gij = fj . Next
define hijk = fi∗ (eijk ), Ai = fi∗ (ω), Bi = fi∗ (mi ) and aij = fi∗ (ηij ). Then this
data defines the local differential forms of Baez and Schreiber [BS], satisfying
equations corresponding to our special G-2-bundles with connection, in partic-
ular with the transition functions gij satisfying the usual cocycle condition for
a principal G-bundle. Note that the Baez-Schreiber local differential forms can
be seen as a generalisation to arbitrary G of the local description of non-abelian
gerbes, with G = Aut(E), of Breen and Messing [BrMe].
    Special G-2-bundles with connection define group morphisms π11 (M, ∗) → G.
However, the definition of the categorical holonomy on a 2-track [Γ] ∈ P2 (M, ∗)
is tricky if one is to deal with the fact that m is not globally defined. This can be
done (and will appear in a future work), however, it will only be, a priori, defined
up to multiplication by central elements of E, and thus it should not define
holonomies P2 (M, ∗) → C(G), unless we restrict to elements of π22 (M, ∗), as in
[MP]. For instance, it is easy to see that given two categorical G-connections
(ω, m) and (ω, m′ ) in P then given a 2-path Γ ∈ P2 (M, ∗) we have
                               !                                       !

horizontal. We have put γ1 = ∂u (Γ) and γ2 = ∂d (Γ). Also eΓ and e′Γ denote
2-dimensional holonomy with respect to (ω, m) and (ω, m′ ), respectively.
    For this reason we feel that it is likely that the construction in this article,
with a globally defined m, will describe all categorical holonomies P2 (M, ∗) →
C(G), especially if we consider a generalised unbased setting. We will investigate
this issue in a future publication.

2.5     Wilson Spheres
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be
the associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M and a
smooth principal G-bundle P → M , with a connection ω ∈ A1 (P, g), as well as
a G-categorical connection (ω, m). The aim of this subsection is to define the
categorical holonomy of a 2-sphere Σ embedded in M .

2.5.1   The dependence of a categorical connection holonomy on the
        elements of the fibre
Choose u, v ∈ P . We want to relate F(ω,m,u) with F(ω,m,v) . Suppose first that
u, v each belong to the fibre Px of P at a certain point x ∈ M . Let g ∈ G be
the unique element such that u = vg. Let γ be a 1-path of M starting and
ending at x. Then Hω (γ, 1, u) = Hω (γ, 1, vg) = Hω (γ, 1, v)g. Therefore since
             1                               1
Hω (γ, 1, u)F(ω,u) (γ) = u and Hω (γ, 1, v)F(ω,v) (γ) = v we have the well-known
formula:
                             1             1
                            F(ω,v) (γ) = gF(ω,u) (γ)g −1 ,                   (31)
for γ a smooth curve starting and ending at x and u = vg, where u, v ∈ Px and
g ∈ G.
                         2                     2
    Let us now see how F(m,ω,u) is related to F(m,ω,v) .

Lemma 45 For any 2-path Γ in M , with ∂l (Γ) = ∂r (Γ) = x, we have:
                           2                  2
                          F(ω,m,v) (Γ) = g ⊲ F(ω,m,u) (Γ),                            (32)
where u, v belong to the fibre Px of P , and g ∈ G is such that u = vg.
Proof. As usual, put Γ(t, s) = γs (t); s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Let eΓ (s) and fΓ (s) be defined
by the differential equations:
                                Z 1                       !

The fourth equation follows from (30). Therefore g −1 ⊲ fΓ (s) = eΓ (s), for each
                                  2                  2
s ∈ [0, 1], thus, in particular, F(ω,m,v) (Γ) = g ⊲ F(ω,m,u) (Γ).
   There is a natural left action of G on G⋉E, given by g⊲(h, e) = (ghg −1 , g⊲e).
Using this, we can summarise the results of this subsection, equations (31) and
(32), in the following:
Theorem 46 If v ∈ Px then

                              F(ω,m,vg) = g −1 ⊲ F(ω,m,v)                                (33)

for any g ∈ G.

2.5.2    The dependence of a categorical connection holonomy on the
         point in the principal bundle
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M ,
and a smooth principal G-bundle P → M with a connection ω ∈ A1 (P, g). Let
(ω, m) be a G-categorical connection on P . Let x, y ∈ M . Choose v ∈ Py .
Let µ be a 1-path connecting y with x. This curve µ defines a categorical
group isomorphism Tµ : P2 (M, y) → P2 (M, x) in the obvious way, by considering
horizontal compositions. More precisely let Γµ be the 2-path such that Γµ (t, s) =
                                                                                    .
µ(t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Let also Γµ−1 (t, s) = µ−1 (t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Then Tµ ([Γ]) =
[Γµ−1 ] ◦h [Γ] ◦h [Γµ ] ∈ P2 (M, x) for each [Γ] ∈ P2 (M, y), and Tµ ([γ]) = [µ−1 γµ]
for [µ] ∈ π11 (M, y).

Theorem 47 Let u = Hω (µ, 1, v). We have:

                              F(ω,m,v) = F(ω,m,u) ◦ Tµ .                                 (34)

Proof. Let [Γ] ∈ P2 (M, y). Then [Γ] = [Γµ ] ◦h Tµ ([Γ]) ◦h [Γµ−1 ]. Let Γ1 =
Γµ ◦h Γµ−1 ◦h Γ ◦h Γµ ◦h Γµ−1 , thus [Γ1 ] = [Γ]. Put γs (t) = Γ1 (t, s); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].

                                           40
Let also Γ′ = Γµ−1 ◦h Γ◦h Γµ , thus [Γ′ ] = Tµ [Γ]. Put γs′ (t) = Γ′ (t, s); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].
We have

                   = eΓ1 (s)      m     γ (t), γs (t)                 dt
                               0    ∂t s        ∂s
                                                            Hω (γs ,t,u)

The second equation follows since Γµ (s, t) does not depend on s. Comparing
with equation 19 it follows that eΓ1 (s) = eΓ′ (s), for each s ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore:
                                                                    2
 2
F(ω,m,v)          2
         ([Γ]) = F(ω,m,v) ([Γ1 ]) = eΓ1 = eΓ′ = F(ω,m,u)
                                                 2
                                                         ([Γ′ ]) = F(ω,m,u) (Tµ ([Γ])).

This finishes the proof of the result at the level of the elements of P2 (M, y).
The proof at the level of the elements of π11 (M, y) is similar.

2.5.3    Associating 2-holonomies to embedded spheres
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let M be a smooth mani-
fold. Consider a principal G-bundle P over M with a G-categorical connection
(ω, m). Consider an embedded oriented 2-sphere Σ ⊂ M . We want to define
the categorical holonomy of Σ, which we call a Wilson Sphere, by analogy with
Wilson loops, familiar in gauge theory.

Definition 48 Choose an orientation preserving parametrisation
                                                 φ

                                             →Σ⊂M

of Σ. Let ∗ = φ(∂D2 ) ∈ Σ ⊂ M . Choose u ∈ P∗ , the fibre of P at ∗. The
categorical holonomy of Σ is defined as:
                                        2
                    W(ω,m) (Σ, φ, u) = F(ω,m,u) (φ) ∈ ker(∂) ⊂ E.

The fact that the categorical holonomy W(ω,m) (Σ, φ, u) lives in ker(∂) ⊂ E
follows from the fact that ∂d (φ) = ∂u (φ) = ∗, and lemma 40.

Theorem 49 The categorical holonomy W(ω,m) (Σ, φ, u) does not depend on φ
and u, up to acting by an element of G. Therefore, we can define a categorical
holonomy W(ω,m) (Σ) of embedded 2-spheres Σ in M (the Wilson Sphere), tak-
ing values in E/G. If Σ∗ is obtained from Σ by reversing its orientation then
                          −1
W(ω,m) (Σ∗ ) = W(ω,m) (Σ)     .




                                            41
Example 50 Consider the U (1)-bundle P n over S 2 with Chern class n, where
n ∈ Z. Define a crossed module G given by the exponential map exp : iR → U (1),
considering the trivial action of U (1) on iR. Consider some connection 1-form
ω on Pn , thus (ω, Ω) is a categorical G-connection on P n . We will then have
that W(ω,Ω) (S 2 ) = n.

    Proof. (Theorem 49) The independence of W(ω,m) (Σ, φ, u) on the choice
of u ∈ P∗ , up to acting by an element of G, follows from theorem 46.
                                                                                                  φ′
     Choose a different orientation preserving parametrisation D2 /∂D2 −→ Σ
of Σ. Since both φ and φ′ are orientation preserving, there exists a smooth 1-
parameter family of embeddings x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ φx connecting φ and φ′ . Here φx is
an orientation preserving parametrisation φx : D2 /∂D2 → Σ, for each x ∈ [0, 1].
     Let q : [0, 1] → M be the map such that q(x) = φx (∂([0, 1]2 )), ∀x ∈ [0, 1];
                                     .
therefore ∗ = q(0). Put Γx (t, s) = φx (t, s), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore
                                                                   .
∂l (Γ ) = ∂r (Γ ) = q(x), for each x ∈ [0, 1]. Let also J(t, s, x) = Γx (t, s), where
      x           x

t, s, x ∈ [0, 1].
     The map J : [0, 1]3 → Σ ⊂ M satisfies the conditions of theorem 42. In
particular

             W(ω,m) (Σ, φ0 , u) = eΓ0 = eΓ1 = W(ω,m) (Σ, φ1 , Hω (q, 1, u)),

since certainly Rank(Dz J) ≤ 2, ∀z ∈ [0, 1]3 .
    Finally, let φ−1 (x, y) = φ(1 − x, y); ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1]. It does not follow that
  −1
φ ◦h φ is rank-2 homotopic to ∗ in a strict sense, since a homotopy connecting
φ−1 ◦h φ with ∗ will have some singular points, as φ and φ−1 are not 2-paths,
because they fail the sitting instant conditions.
    Let γs (t) = φ(t, s) and γs′ (t) = φ−1 (t, s), where t, s ∈ [0, 1]. Let us analyse
eφ−1 (s) directly. We have:

The result follows from the fact that if A(t) is a smooth function [0, 1] → E and if
                       d                                                    .
w(s) is a solution of ds w(s) = w(s)A(s) then the smooth function v(s) = w(s)−1
                 d                                                  −1
is a solution of ds v(s) = −A(s)v(s). In particular eφ−1 (1) = eφ (1).
    Note that the previous proof uses, in an essential way, the fact that the
mapping class group of S 2 is {±1}. Therefore, it is likely that the previous
theorem does not extend to an embedded surface of genus greater than zero.
However, it is probable that this can be fixed if any embedded surface Σ ⊂ M
is assigned an equivalence class of embedding S → Σ, where two embeddings
φ, φ′ : S → Σ are equivalent if φ−1 ◦ φ′ is isotopic to the identity diffeomorphism.
We will analyse this issue in a subsequent publication.


3     Appendix: Technical Lemmas
The following lemmas provide the foundation for the construction of the 2-
category S2 (M ), defined for any smooth manifold M . Specifically, lemma 52 is
used to prove that the vertical composition of 2-tracks is well defined; see 1.3.3.

Lemma 51 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let f : S 2 → M be a smooth map.
Consider a handle decomposition H of M . Let H i be the i-skeleton of H; in
other words H i is the handlebody made from the handles of H of index less than
or equal to i, where i = 0, 1, . . . , dim(M ). There exists an ambient isotopy of
M , sending H to a handle decomposition I of M , such that f (S 2 ) ⊂ I 2 , the
2-skeleton of the handle decomposition I.

     Proof. Let m = dim(M ).
     Let J be the handle decomposition of M which is dual to H. If m = 2 there
is nothing to prove. Otherwise f (S 2 ) is a compact set with zero measure in M ,
by Sard’s theorem; see [H]. Therefore, there exists an ambient isotopy of M ,
sending J to a handle decomposition J0 of M , such that the 0-handles of J0
are contained in M \ f (S 2 ), a non-empty open set of M . If m = 3, taking the
dual handle decomposition of J0 , yields a handle decomposition I of M with
f (S 2 ) ⊂ I 2 .
     Suppose that m > 3. Let {h1i } be the set of handles of J0 of index 1. Then
each 1-handle h1i is of the form h1i = D1i × Dm−1     i     , and attaches to the 0-skeleton
J00 of J0 along Si0 × Dm−1      i    .  For each  i, let p 1    1
                                                           i : hi → Di
                                                                       m−1
                                                                              be the obvious
                           m                             1
projection. Here D is the m-disk. Then pi can be extended to a smooth
map qi1 : Vi1 → Rm−1 , where Vi1 is an open neighbourhood of h1i in M . For
each i, let A1i = f −1 (Vi1 ) ⊂ S 2 . It is an open set in S 2 . Since m − 1 > 2,
the set (qi1 ◦ f )(A1i ) ⊂ Rm−1 has measure zero, for qi1 is smooth. Therefore
p1i (f (S 2 )) ⊂ (qi1 ◦ f )(A1i ) has measure zero in Dm−1  i    .
     Choose an (m − 1)-ball cm−1      i    ⊂ Dm−1
                                               i   , not intersecting p1i (f (S 2 )); note that
p1i (f (S 2 )) is compact. There exists an ambient isotopy of M , which restricts
to an ambient isotopy of J00 (the 0-skeleton of J0 ), whilst sending each h1i =
D1i × Dm−1i     to D1i × cm−1
                           i      . Let J1 be the handle decomposition of M to which J0
is sent by the ambient isotopy. By construction J11 ∩ f (S 2 ) = ∅. If dim(M ) = 4,


                                              43
taking the dual handle decomposition to J1 , yields the handle decomposition I
of M , and by construction f (S 2 ) ⊂ I 2 .
    Suppose m > 4. The argument is the same. As above, let {h2i } be the set
of 2-handles of J1 . Then, for any i, h2i = D2i × Dm−2i    , and h2i attaches to J11
         1     m−2                    2     2      m−2
along Si × Di . For each i, let pi : hi → Di            be the obvious projection.
As before, since m − 2 > 2, the set p2i (f (S 2 )), which is compact, has zero
measure in Dm−2i   . Therefore, there exists an (m − 2)-ball cm−2
                                                                i     ⊂ Dm−2
                                                                          i    such
       2     2      m−2
that pi (f (S )) ∩ ci   = ∅. There exists an ambient isotopy of M , restricting
to an ambient isotopy of J11 , and sending h2i = D2i × Dm−2 i    to D2i × cm−2
                                                                            i  , for
each i. Let the handle decomposition J2 be the image of J1 under the ambient
isotopy. As before, by construction, J22 ∩ f (S 2 ) = ∅. If m = 5, letting I be the
handle decomposition of M dual to J2 , then we have that f (S 2 ) ⊂ J 2 .
    An obvious inductive argument will finish the proof for any m ∈ N.

Lemma 52 Let f : ∂(D3 ) → M be a smooth map such that Rank(Dv f ) ≤
1, ∀v ∈ ∂(D3 ). Here D3 = [0, 1]3 . Suppose that f is constant in a neighbourhood
of each vertex of ∂(D3 ). In addition, suppose also that in a neighbourhood
I × [−ǫ, ǫ] of each edge I of ∂(D3 ), f (x, t) = φ(x), where (x, t) ∈ I × [−ǫ, ǫ] and
φ : I → M is smooth. Then f can be extended to a smooth map F : D3 → M
such that Rank(Dw F ) ≤ 2, ∀w ∈ D3 . Moreover we can choose F so that it has
a product structure close to the boundary of D3 .

    Proof. The conditions of the statement imply that f is of the form f ′ ◦ r,
where f ′ : S 2 → M is a smooth map and r : ∂(D3 ) → S 2 is some smooth
homeomorphism.
    By using the previous lemma, we can see that there exists a handle decom-
position of M such that f (∂(D3 )) is contained in the 2-skeleton M 2 of M (the
handlebody made from the 0-,1- and 2-handles of M ). Let us prove that we can
suppose further that f (∂(D3 )) is contained in the 1-skeleton M 1 of M . This
will be completely analogous (though dual) to the proof of the previous lemma.
    Let n = dim(M ). Suppose that n ≥ 2. Let {hi } be the set of 2-handles
of M . Therefore, for each i, hi = D2i × Din−2 , and hi attaches to M 1 along
Si1 × Din−2 = (∂D2i ) × Din−2 . It suffices to prove that for each i there exists an
xi ∈ D2i (thus an open 2-ball) such that f (∂D3 ) does not intersect {xi } × Din−2 .
    Let pi : hi = D2i × Din−2 → D2 × {0} be the obvious projection. Given that
Rank(Dv f ) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ ∂D3 , it follows that Zi = pi (hi ∩f (∂D3 )) has zero measure
in D2 , thus that we can choose an xi in the interior of D2 not intersecting Zi .
Therefore, some open ball in D2 containing xi does not intersect Zi . This proves
that there exists a handle decomposition of M such that f (∂D3 ) is contained in
the interior of the 1-skeleton M 1 of M , analogously to the proof of the previous
lemma.
                                        p
    Consider the universal cover N −    → M 1 of M 1 . It is a contractible smooth
manifold. We can lift f as f = p ◦ g ′ , where g ′ : ∂D3 → N is a smooth map,
such that Rank(Dv g ′ ) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ ∂D3 , since p is a local diffeomorphism. Let
c : N × [0, 1] → N be a smooth contraction of N to a point of it. We can suppose
that there exists an ǫ > 0 such that c does not depend on t for t ∈ [0, ǫ]∪[1−ǫ, 1].


                                         44
The smooth homotopy g(v, t) = p(c(g ′ (v), t)) where t ∈ [0, 1] and v ∈ ∂(D3 ) will
permit us to extend f : ∂(D3 ) → M to a smooth map F : D3 → M , with a
product structure close to the boundary of D3 . By construction we also have
that Rank(Dw F ) ≤ 2, ∀w ∈ D3 .
