The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the
vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all
length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated
systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from diverging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body
systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we
employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic
scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method
accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the
efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a
quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entanglement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of
subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement
highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems
on quantum computers.

INTRODUCTION

In physics and materials science, universality appears near continuous phase transitions, where longrange properties become independent of microscopic details, and the singular behavior of physical quantities
such as susceptibilities and correlation lengths can be
characterized by universal critical exponents. While classical phase transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations,
quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature
when a system parameter is varied, causing the ground
state to become highly entangled due to quantum fluctuations [1, 2]. This groundstate non-locality presents
challenges for theoretical and experimental analysis.
Rapid advancements on controlled quantum platforms
have expanded the range of experimentally accessible
quantum many-body systems on quantum simulators and
computers [3–10]. Previous studies [11–18] have made
significant progress in the experimental characterization
of entanglement. However, probing entanglement properties across quantum phase transitions remains difficult.
Analog quantum simulators have limited control, restricting available models and measurements [19]. Quantum simulations using quantum computers face challenges including: (i) Limited number of qubits: Quantum
phase transitions formally occur only in infinite systems,

∗ thomas.barthel@duke.edu

and finite-size effects are pronounced in the vicinity of
critical points. Preparing critical ground states directly
requires more qubits than current quantum devices offer.
(ii) Exponential cost for probing subsystem entanglement:
Resolving detailed entanglement structures requires state
tomography for large subsystems, which generally results
in exponential costs. (iii) Difficulties in state preparation: Without deeper insight into the physics, the study
of complex many-body ground states necessitates highly
expressive quantum circuits with many gates, leading to
low trainability [20, 21] and significant error accumulation.
We overcome these challenges for condensed-matter
ground states using highly structured quantum circuits on a digital quantum computer.
The circuits prepare states corresponding to hierarchical tensor
networks—the multiscale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA) [22–24]. This ansatz can represent infinite systems and accurately encodes long-range correlations, even at critical points. The causal structure of
MERA, inspired by the real-space renormalization group,
drastically reduces circuit depths and the number of measured qubits, both scaling logarithmically with system
size [25–28]. This allows efficient extraction of local
observables, subsystem entanglement, and entanglement
spectra. Additionally, MERA is robust to noise [29] and
not affected by barren plateaus [30, 31].
In this work, we study quantum many-body ground
states on a digital quantum computer based on a chain of
ytterbium ions. We demonstrate a quantum phase tran-

FIG. 1. MERA on a trapped-ion chain. (a) An infinite,
binary 1D MERA with three homogeneous layers. The ansatz
is prepared from top to bottom, with each layer comprising
entangling gates (bare rectangles) and isometries (rectangles
with attached circles) that double the number of sites. The
output is the many-body state on the physical spin sites.
Repeating the MERA circuit horizontally in the spatial dimension generates a state in the thermodynamic limit. Local observables and bipartite entanglement can be studied
by executing circuits within the corresponding causal cone
(unshaded area) and measuring the target qubits. (b) Each
MERA tensor is implemented as a sequence of two- and onequbit gates. Circles represent qubits initialized in |0⟩, and
diamonds indicate measurements. (c) Repeated preparation
and measurement yield probabilistic binary outcomes (0s and

(d) Fluorescence image of a 15-ion (171 Yb+ ) chain with two
hardware-tailored examples of ion-to-qubit mappings: Map I
for local measurements on sites 0 and 1, and Map II optimized
for entanglement studies with respect to a bipartition into the
semi-infinite subsystems A = (−∞, 1] and B = [2, ∞).

As shown in Fig. 1(a), the layered structure of MERA
tensor networks introduces an additional dimension associated with a hierarchy of length and energy scales. The
MERA comprises T layers, each composed of unitary
(dis)entanglers and isometries, which can be efficiently
implemented on our hardware. Viewed from bottom to
top, starting from the physical layer, MERA acts as a
renormalization group (RG) flow, where the ascending
layer index represents the RG scale. In each renormalization step, short-distance entanglement is removed by
the disentanglers (bare rectangles), and the isometries
(rectangles with attached circles) then coarse-grain the
system. This process maps physical sites to renormalized effective degrees of freedom, continuing until the
final layer T ∼ log ξ is reached, where ξ is the largest
correlation length in the system.
Viewed in reverse (the direction of decreasing layer index), the MERA represents a quantum circuit, which
prepares the quantum state by first generating longrange correlations associated with low-energy modes, and
then progressively incorporating shorter-range correlations that correspond to higher energy scales. For each
layer, ancillary qubits initialized in the |0⟩ state (depicted
as circles) are injected and entangled with existing qubits
through unitary operations. Each unitary tensor consists
of two-qubit entangling gates and single-qubit rotations,
as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).

in the thermodynamic limit, using 12 or fewer qubits. We
show the universal scaling of relevant physical quantities
near the transition and observe significant changes in the
entanglement structure across the critical point. At the
critical point, we find that the subsystem entanglement
entropies follow a universal log-area law, and the gap of
the entanglement Hamiltonian closes as the subsystem
size increases. In non-critical regimes, subsystem entanglement entropy follows an area law [32–34]. The measured entanglement Hamiltonian remains gapped with
increasing subsystem size and accurately reproduces expected symmetry properties.

SETUP

Preparing ground states of many-body systems with
long-range quantum fluctuations is challenging. This can
be mitigated by accounting for the system’s entanglement
structure. To approximate the ground state |Ψ⟩ in the
thermodynamic limit, we implement MERA on a digital

Observables and holographic subsystem
tomography

Local observables can be studied by implementing only
the associated causal-cone circuits. For measurements on
sites 0 and 1 of a binary one-dimensional (1D) MERA,
the corresponding reduced circuit is indicated by the nonshaded MERA tensors in Fig. 1(a). Due to their isometric properties, the shaded tensors outside the causal cone
do not influence the local measurements.
Entanglement entropies and spectra for a spatial bipartition of the system into parts A and B can be obtained
from the reduced density matrix ϱ̂B = TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|. For
a MERA, only the gates within the causal cone of the
boundary between A and B need to be implemented, as
gates outside the causal cone correspond to unitary basis
transformations ÛA and ÛB in the two subsystems and
do not affect bipartite entanglement properties. Moreover, tomography on the renormalized sites (qubits) at
the edges of A’s causal cone provides access to ϱ̂B in the
basis defined by ÛB . Thus, due to the causal structure
of MERA, the number of gates and number of measured
qubits are proportional to the number of layers T ∼ log ξ,
rather than the total system size and subsystem size,

3
respectively. Details of our scheme, termed holographic
subsystem tomography, are described in Appendix A.
In the experiment, we implement an infinite, homogeneous, binary 1D MERA with bond dimension χ = 2
and up to T = 5 layers, which captures a maximum correlation range of 3 × 25 = 96 sites. To this purpose,
all tensors of the same color in Fig. 1(a) are chosen to
be identical, and the shown tensor network structure is
continued horizontally ad infinitum. For the self-similar
critical systems, the correlation length ξ diverges, which
we address by employing a scale-invariant MERA [35, 36]
as discussed in Sec. III B 2 and Appendix C.

C.

Trapped-ion system

We implement MERA circuits on a digital ion-trap
quantum computer. Our experimental system consists
of a linear chain of fifteen 171 Yb+ ions, spaced by approximately 3.7 µm, confined in a micro-fabricated Paul
trap (Sandia HOA-2.1.1 [37]) held in a room-temperature
vacuum chamber. The qubits are encoded in the hyperfine “clock” states of the ground 2 S1/2 electronic manifold
as |0⟩ ≡ |F = 0; mF = 0⟩ and |1⟩ ≡ |F = 1; mF = 0⟩,
where F is the total atomic angular momentum and mF
its projection onto the direction of the magnetic field,
with a magnitude of 3.2 G. Qubits are initialized in the
|0⟩ state using optical pumping and measured by statedependent fluorescence on the 369 nm D1 line.
The qubits are manipulated via a Raman process using a wide (300 µm×30 µm) linearly-polarized globaladdressing beam and equispaced, linearly-polarized
1 µm-diameter individual-addressing beams derived from
the same 355-nm pulsed laser (Coherent Paladin Compact 355-4000). Radio-frequency (rf) gate waveforms
are produced by an rf system on a chip (ZCU111
from Xilinx Corp.) controlled by the Sandia Octet
firmware [38] and separately modulated onto each laser
beam using acousto-optic modulators (L3 Harris Corp.).
Available single-qubit operations are virtual z-axis rotations Rz (θ), implemented via phase offsets in the
radio-frequency controls, and physical xy-plane rotations R(θ, ϕ) = e−iθ(X̂ cos ϕ+Ŷ sin ϕ)/2 . Entangling gates
XX(θ) = e−iθX̂i ⊗X̂j /2 between arbitrary qubits i and
j are realized through a Mølmer-Sørensen interaction
mediated by the shared radial motional modes of the
ion chain with mode frequencies near 3 MHz. This interaction is implemented by amplitude-shaping a statedependent force on the addressed ions using the 355-nm
Raman process.
The all-to-all qubit connectivity of our platform simplifies the implementation of the non-local MERA circuits.
Using a detailed error model discussed in Appendix E, we
optimize ion-to-qubit mappings for each MERA circuit;
see Fig. 1(d).

Here, X̂i and Ẑi are Pauli operators acting on the spin
at lattice site i, and g is the transverse magnetic field.
The TFIM features a well-characterized continuous quantum phase transition with spontaneous Z2 symmetrybreaking, making it a good testbed for our approach.
Since the 1D binary MERA with small bond dimension
is classically simulable, we determine the optimal gate parameters of the variational MERA circuit using classical
computers. The gate compilation of the tensors and a
concrete circuit example are discussed in Appendix D.

A.

Quantum phase transition

We benchmark the infinite MERA across the quantum
phase transition of the TFIM (1) by first measuring local
observables ⟨Ôi ⟩. We prepare the causal-cone state of
the target spins as indicated in Fig. 1. The number T
of employed MERA layers ranges from 2 to 5, depending
on the correlation length; T = 2 layers are used far from
criticality and up to 5 layers near the critical point g = 1.
Correspondingly, the number of required qubits ranges
from 6 to 12.
Figure 2(a) shows the measured magnetization ⟨X̂⟩ in
the x-direction as a function of the z-field g, nicely resolving the phase transition. For g > 1, the observed
magnetization is consistent with zero within the statistical uncertainty, as expected for the paramagnetic phase.
For g < 1, non-zero magnetization is observed along
the x-direction, indicating spontaneous breaking of the
X̂ → −X̂ symmetry, characteristic of the ferromagnetic
phase. Due to experimental noise, the observed magnetization at small g is slightly lower than the theoretical
prediction ⟨X̂⟩ = (1 − g 2 )1/8 in the thermodynamic limit
L → ∞ [39–41].
We conducted separate experiments to characterize
noise and develop a corresponding error model, as described in Appendix E. In simulations, we model gateinduced dephasing and addressing noise due to ion motion by randomly perturbing gates in each shot. We
model idle dephasing, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and X-flip errors during entangling
gates by introducing random Z- and X-flips. The noisy
simulations (shaded area in Fig. 2(a)) demonstrate excellent agreement with experimental data.
To determine the critical exponent, Fig. 2(b) displays
the order parameter ⟨X̂⟩ on a logarithmic scale. Due to
the small MERA bond dimension χ = 2, ⟨X̂⟩ saturates

otherwise noted, error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals obtained from a bootstrap resampling of the experimental data,
based on 2,000 measurements per quantum circuit.

at a non-zero value as the system approaches the critical regime. Nevertheless, it is still possible to determine
the critical scaling from these experimental data. The
inset shows the critical exponent obtained by fitting the
data in ranges g ∈ [0.5, gcut ]. The fitted values gradually converge to the theoretical prediction of 1/8 but
deviate when gcut approaches g = 1. Such deviations
near the critical point can be mitigated by increasing the
bond dimension χ. As shown by the thick gray dotted
line, a Trotterized MERA circuit [25–28] with χ = 4 is
predicted to achieve sufficient accuracy to eliminate the
discrepancies at the cost of more qubits and gates.
Figure 2(c) shows additional local observables.

As

the transverse field g increases, the dominant contribution to the groundstate energy shifts from the correlator
⟨X̂i X̂i+1 ⟩ to the field term ⟨Ẑi ⟩, showing a symmetry due
to the Kramers-Wannier duality [42] with respect to the
critical point g = 1. The measured values of these observables cross at a slightly smaller value of g, aligning
with our noise model. Here, the noise is dominated by
fluctuations in XX-gate rotations due to the ions’ axial
motion (see Appendix E 3).

Entanglement structure

In the following, we use MERA to investigate groundstate entanglement across the quantum phase transition
in the TFIM (1). We find that MERA on the digital
quantum computer can resolve details of the entanglement structure, including the hallmark transition from
area-law to log-area-law scaling of block entanglement
entropies when approaching the critical point.

1.

Local entanglement measures

For a pure state |Ψ⟩, the entanglement between subsystem B and its complement A can be quantified by the
Rényi entanglement entropy
(α)

SB =

1
log2 Tr(ϱ̂α
B ), where ϱ̂B = TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| (2)
1−α

is the reduced density matrix of subsystem B. Our approach provides efficient access to the entanglement spec(α)
tra and, hence, SB for any α. Here, we focus on the
Rényi-2 entropy (α = 2) as, for the TFIM (1), all Rényi
entropies with α > 0 exhibit the same scaling.
The reduced density matrix for a single-site is fully
characterized by its Bloch vector. The time-reversal symmetry of the TFIM ensures that the local expectation
value ⟨Ŷ ⟩ vanishes for all eigenstates. Thus, the Bloch
vector is determined by ⟨X̂⟩ and ⟨Ẑ⟩. Figure 2(d) shows
the measured single-site Rényi-2 entanglement entropy.
Our data faithfully reproduces the predicted sharp peak
at criticality and tends to zero for small g. In the ferromagnetic phase, the two symmetry-broken ground states
are almost product states. Meanwhile, their symmetric
superposition is entangled, and the corresponding singlesite entanglement is smooth at the critical point. The inset of Fig. 2(d) presents the nearest-neighbor concurrence
(pairwise entanglement) C0,1 [41, 44] obtained from the
measured nearest-neighbor correlators ⟨X̂0 X̂1 ⟩, ⟨Ẑ0 Ẑ1 ⟩,
and ⟨Ŷ0 Ŷ1 ⟩ [45, 46]. The concurrence slightly deviates
from theoretical predictions but aligns well with noisy
simulations. Notably, the concurrence does not peak
at criticality but increases smoothly before reaching a
broad maximum in the paramagnetic phase. This suggests that the peak of single-site entanglement at criticality arises not only from short-distance entanglement but
also from the accumulation of entanglement over long
distances. In contrast, in the paramagnetic phase, the
nearest-neighbor entanglement is the dominant contribution to the single-site entanglement.

2.

Entanglement scaling: area-law versus log-area-law

For the ground states of typical quantum many-body
systems in D spatial dimensions, the subsystem entanglement entropy S(ℓ) is proportional to the surface area of

the subsystem ∝ ℓD−1 , rather than its volume ∝ ℓD [32–
34]. The entanglement entropy is dominated by shortrange correlations around the subsystem boundary, resulting in area-law scaling. This can change when the
system becomes critical and the correlation length diverges. For critical systems in 1D and fermionic systems
with a Fermi surface of codimension D−1, the subsystem
entanglement entropy is predicted to follow a log-area law
∝ ℓD−1 log ℓ [47–52].
Resolving these fundamentally different scaling laws
has remained an experimental challenge. In small systems, it is difficult to differentiate between log-area-law
and area-law scalings. As the linear subsystem size ℓ
grows, preparing ground states with sufficient precision
becomes increasingly difficult, and, in direct approaches,
the number of measurements needed for subsystem tomography grows exponentially in ℓ.
For MERA, however, each step of the renormalization
process changes length scales by a constant factor. This
maps a logarithmic scaling in the subsystem size ℓ to
a linear scaling in the number of renormalization steps
T = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Thus, distinguishing between area and
log-area laws in 1D translates to determining whether the
entanglement entropy saturates or grows linearly with
increasing T .
We experimentally realize spatially infinite MERA
with a finite number of layers T . For a bipartition into
subsystems A = (−∞, 1] and B = [2, +∞), we implement the holographic subsystem tomography as described in Sec. II and detailed in Appendix A. We prepare the MERA circuit within the causal cone of the
subsystem boundary, measure the T renormalized sites
at the right edge of the cone (Fig. 1), and use the classical
shadow method [53] to extract the Rényi-2 entanglement
entropy (2). The finite number of MERA layers limits
the maximal correlation length to 3 × 2T . Thus, we experimentally probe effective subsystem sizes ℓ ∝ 2T . See
Appendix B for a more detailed argument on this relation
of T and effective subsystem sizes.
For the non-critical point g = 1.5 of the TFIM (1), the
measured half-chain Rényi-2 entanglement entropy S is
shown in Fig. 3(b). We observe a rapid saturation of the
entanglement entropy for T ≥ 3, in agreement with the
area-law. This is expected as, due to the energy gap,
the physical correlation length ξ is finite. Here, additional MERA layers (T > 3) have a negligible effect on
the groundstate approximation and entanglement for this
gapped system. Our error model indicates that, in this
regime, SPAM errors and gate rotation errors due to the
ions’ axial motion are the dominant noise sources.
At criticality (g = 1), the system has gapless excitations, and the correlation length diverges (ξ → ∞). Here,
we model the ground state using a scale-invariant MERA
with an infinite number of homogeneous identical layers
in both the spatial and preparation directions [35, 36].
Directly preparing a scale-invariant MERA is not experimentally feasible. Instead, we truncate at layer T and
add an additional tensor to the top layer to minimize the

estimation.

finite-T effects as detailed in Appendix C.
The measured half-chain Rényi-2 entanglement entropy S at criticality is shown as a function of T in
Fig. 3(a). The observed entropy increases linearly by
approximately 1/16 per MERA layer. This is consistent
1
log2 (ℓ/a) of conformal field thewith the prediction 16
ory, where a is an ultraviolet cutoff that regularizes the
continuum field theory [54]. The slight increase in the
measured S over the field-theoretical prediction is reproduced by our error model. Here, errors primarily arise
during SPAM and from fluctuations in gate angles due
to the ions’ axial motion; X-flips and idle dephasing are
secondary (see Appendix E).

3.

Entanglement spectrum

Using the holographic tomography data and a
maximum-likelihood approach [55–58], we reconstruct
proper (positive semidefinite) density matrices ϱ̂B for
subsystem B in the
P ÛB basis. They can be written in
the form ϱ̂B = 2− i ζi |ζi ⟩⟨ζi | , where {ζi := − log2 λi } is
the entanglement spectrum [59] expressed in terms of the
eigenvalues {λi } of ϱ̂B .
Figures 4(a) and (d) show the two lowest entanglement
eigenvalues {ζ0 , ζ1 } of ϱ̂B for the TFIM (1), revealing distinct behaviors at and away from the critical point. At
criticality (g = 1), the lowest eigenvalue ζ0 exhibits a
log-law scaling like the entanglement entropy, while ζ1
decreases with increasing T . As shown in Fig. 4(b), the
Schmidt gap ∆λ = λ0 −λ1 reduces by approximately 1/24
per renormalization step, which agrees with the approximate theoretical prediction ∆λ ∼ ℓ−1/24 from Ref. [43],
where ℓ denotes again the (effective) subsystem size. For
the non-critical point g = 1.5, Fig. 4(d) shows that ζ0
and ζ1 saturate with increasing T .
Since g = 1.5 lies in the Z2 -symmetric paramagnetic
phase, all subsystem density matrices of the ground state
must commute with the operator ⊗i Ẑi . We verify this
symmetry by measuring the spin-flip operator on subsystem B. As discussed in Sec. II, the measurement is done
efficiently with the compressed representation of ϱ̂B on
the renormalized sites, exploiting the fact that, for g ≥ 1,
the unitary ÛB which transforms the measured state to
the actual state on B preserves the Z2 -symmetry. As observed in Fig. 4(e), the associated entanglement Hamiltonian exhibits a ground state in the even-parity sector
and a first excited state in the odd sector. This mirrors
the properties of the system Hamiltonian, aligning with
recent efforts concerning connections between entanglement Hamiltonians and system Hamiltonians [17, 60].

Subsystem fidelity

Finally, we compare the reconstructed subsystem density matrix ϱ̂B in the ÛB basis with the ideal MERA
simulations, and show the infidelity 1 − F in Figs. 4c

and for the transverse fields g = 1.0 and 1.5, where the
fidelity is defined as
F=

 q
2
p

ϱ̂B ρ̂ideal ϱ̂B .

(3)

We achieve infidelities ranging from 10−4 to 10−2 , which
enables the clear discrimination of different entanglement
scaling laws, even when the absolute difference in S is
small. These high fidelities arise from careful calibrations, optimized ion–qubit mappings, the intrinsic noise
resilience of MERA, suitable gate decompositions for the
MERA circuit, and the efficient holographic tomography
method.
Recall that we determine ϱ̂B through tomography on
only ∼ T renormalized sites at the edge of subsystem A’s
causal cone (cf. Sec. II B and Fig. 5), where, in the basis
defined by ÛB , all other qubits are in the |0⟩ state and
need not be implemented. This is sufficient because the
fidelity metric (3) and bipartite entanglement properties
are invariant under the unitary transformation ÛB .
Also, while many widely used variational ansätze
employ CNOT gates, our circuits use two-qubit XX
Mølmer-Sørensen gates with typical absolute rotation angles in the range from 0.01π to 0.2π, which are much
smaller than those of fully entangling gates. As MølmerSørensen gate errors decrease with the rotation angle,
this leads to significantly reduced experimental errors.
Appendix F provides a breakdown of error contributions
and explains how the infidelity scales with experimental
errors.

OUTLOOK

We employed MERA on an ion-trap quantum computer to clearly resolve the quantum phase transition in a
condensed matter system, successfully capturing the universal properties of Ising-class physics. Furthermore, our
holographic subsystem tomography method made it possible to demonstrate the transition from area-law to logarea-law scaling in groundstate entanglement entropies.
This entanglement scaling transition is a hallmark of
quantum many-body physics with no classical analog. Its
experimental observation had previously faced substantial challenges including finite-size effects and attainable
fidelities.
The investigation of more complicated models, including systems with higher spin and spatial dimensions, requires larger MERA bond dimensions χ ≳ 8. In classical
MERA simulations, the primary bottleneck are tensor
contractions, whose cost scales as O(χr ), where the exponent r depends on the spatial dimension D and specific
MERA structure. In 1D with r = 7, . . . , 9, these costs
are still tractable for moderate bond dimensions χ ≲ 20
[22–24]. However, for higher-dimensional systems such
as (quasi-)2D frustrated quantum magnets and fermionic
systems, where quantum Monte Carlo generally fails due

8
to the negative sign problem, the classical contraction
costs with scaling exponents r = 16, . . . , 26 become prohibitive even for small χ [24, 61].
To avoid these high contraction costs, our prior
work [25, 26] proposed implementing (Trotterized)
MERA on quantum computers. As discussed in Refs. [25,
26, 28], the required qubit count grows only logarithmically with χ and is independent of system size if midcircuit resets are available. The circuit depth scales as
O(T t), where the number of MERA layers T ∼ log ξ governs the maximal correlated length ξ, and t is a tunable
Trotter depth that controls the expressiveness of subcircuits in individual tensors. For example, simulating
a large (e.g., hundreds-by-hundreds) 2D system with a
2 × 2 7→ 1 MERA using χ = 8, T = 6, and t = 2 requires either (i) 108 resettable qubits and a circuit depth
of 96 when minimizing depth or (ii) 42 qubits and depth
624 when minimizing the qubit count. Such circuits are
not classically tractable, yet they are realistic for stateof-the-art quantum hardware.
Recent advances in trapped-ion platforms have
brought these capabilities closer to realization. For example, 56-qubit systems with ≥99.8% two-qubit gate fidelity
are now available [62], and circuits with over 2000 twoqubit gates have been demonstrated [63]. Larger systems,
with ∼ 200 qubits, can be achieved by scaling up the
system used in this work [64]. The primary error source
in high-connectivity long ion chains—motional heating
of low-frequency modes—can be reduced by over two orders of magnitude using cryogenic techniques and sympathetic cooling with a different isotopic species [65]. This
approach also facilitates qubit reset and reuse, further
enhancing scalability.
Since MERA has been rigorously proven to be free of
barren plateaus [30, 31], the variational optimization of
MERA on quantum computers is feasible, and we have
substantiated a polynomial quantum advantage, which
is particularly pronounced in D ≥ 2 spatial dimensions
[26].
Once an optimized MERA state is determined, rich
physics can be probed through local observables, correlators, and entanglement measures. Measuring local
observables and correlators is straightforward, requiring similar resources as energy estimation. Probing entanglement is more demanding, as large-χ MERA involve multiple qubits per renormalized site, making holographic subsystem tomography costly. To address this,
one can perform randomized measurements on edges of
the boundary causal cones, and adopt the idea of entanglement Hamiltonian tomography [17, 60] to learn
the renormalized entanglement Hamiltonian, assuming a
structured form in terms of renormalized degrees of freedom.
Beyond the study of strongly correlated many-body
ground states, MERA states can serve as high-quality
starting points for the investigation of nonequilibrium dynamics. As demonstrated in this work, MERA accurately
captures both critical and non-critical ground states. A

natural extension is to prepare a MERA state and evolve
it under quench or Floquet dynamics. Since entanglement growth under nonequilibrium dynamics generally
leads to volume-law scaling of entanglement entropies, a
quantum advantage is expected as soon as we surpass
the realm of exact classical Krylov-subspace methods for
≳36 qubits.

Appendix A: Holographic subsystem tomography
and entanglement scaling

For the study of bipartite entanglement entropies, entanglement spectra, and subsystem state fidelities as discussed in Sec. III, we consider MERA approximations
|Ψ⟩ for the ground state and a spatial bipartition into
subsystem A and its complement B.
The goal of the holographic subsystem tomography is
to efficiently access the reduced density matrix ϱ̂B =
TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| of subsystem B in the experiment. The isometric property (Ŵ † Ŵ = 1) of the MERA tensors implies that, under the partial trace TrA , all tensors outside the causal cone of B can be removed, as exemplified
by the shaded area atop subsystem A in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the aforementioned quantities are all invariant
under unitary transformations on subsystem B. Using
this invariance, we can remove all MERA gates outside
the causal cone of subsystem A, which corresponds to
the action of the unitary transformation ÛB† from Sec. II.
Only the gates inside the causal cone(s) of the subsystem boundary(ies) remain. All qubits outside this causal
cone are in the reference state |0⟩ and need not be implemented in the experiment.

9
To determine the transformed subsystem density matrix
ÛB† ϱ̂B ÛB = TrA (ÛB† |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|ÛB ),

(A1)

we only need to measure the ∼ T non-trivial renormalized sites at the edge of A’s causal cone, as indicated by
the diamonds in Fig. 5. Again T denotes the number of
MERA layers.
To further reduce experimental resource requirements,
we consider either infinite chains with a bipartition into
two semi-infinite subsystems, or finite chains with periodic boundary conditions where block B is large enough
such that the causal cones of its two boundaries are disjoint as exemplified in Fig. 5. In the latter scenario, the
transformed density operator (A1) is actually a tensor

right edge, and central sites in the reference state |0⟩⟨0|,

Due to the product structure, ϱ̃L
B and ϱ̃B can be measured independently.
Moreover, when studying quantities that only depend
on the spectrum of ϱ̂B for a bipartition of the system
into two equally sized halves and for total system sizes
L = 6 × 2T , 8 × 2T , ..., it is sufficient to measure only one
of the two density operators. In this case, the MERA

circuits for ϱ̃L
B and ϱ̃B prepare the same pure state, and
only differ in the selection of sites to be measured: those

of a corresponding finite-size MERA for a system of
2ξmax = 6 × 2T sites with periodic boundary conditions.
Furthermore, the half-chain density operator of an infinite T -layer MERA, considered in Sec. III, is given by
ÛB† ϱ̂B ÛB = ϱ̃L
B ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ . . . ,

(B2)

where ϱ̃L
B is the same state as the one in Eq. (A2) for an
ℓ = 3 × 2T -site block in a periodic 6 × 2T -site system,
establishing the exponential relation between ℓ and T .
The spectra of the states (B2) and (A2) are related by
the elementwise product (A3).
Appendix C: Scale-invariant MERA

Scale-invariant MERA are designed for critical systems, where correlation lengths diverge. As shown in
Fig. 6(a), they feature an elementary cell of tensors that
repeats in the spatial and renormalization directions, in
accordance with the self-similarity of critical systems.
Viewed in the renormalization direction, the scaleinvariant MERA maps the local Hamiltonian of a critical system into an RG fixed point. Seen in reverse, the
scale-invariant MERA acts as a quantum channel that
iteratively refines the state, starting from an initial reference state and adding layers to construct the ground
state of the critical system.
Consider spin sites 0 and 1. Their causal-cone state
as indicated by the unshaded region in Fig.6(a) is constructed by applying the same layer-transition channel
M (Fig. 6(b)) multiple times, where renormalized sites
that leave the causal cone are traced out. M is a quantum channel and can be diagonalized in bi-orthonormal
operator bases such that
X
M(·) = |ϱ̂steady ⟩⟩⟨⟨1| +
mi |r̂i ⟩⟩⟨⟨ℓ̂i |,
(C1)
i>0

Appendix B: Subsystem size versus number of
MERA layers

where |mi | < 1 for all i > 0, and we use a super-braket notation for the operator-basis elements according
to


†
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product ⟨⟨L̂|R̂⟩⟩ := Tr L̂ R̂ .

In the main text, we associated the number T of layers
in infinite MERA with the logarithm of subsystem sizes
ℓ. Here, we elaborate further on this relation.
Infinite binary 1D MERA |Ψ⟩ with T layers have a
maximum correlation range ξmax := 3 × 2T , where the
prefactor 3 arises from the maximal causal-cone width
of local operators acting on k ≤ 3 contiguous sites. In
particular, connected correlation functions

With r̂0 ≡ ϱ̂steady and ℓ̂0 ≡ 1, r̂i and ℓ̂i are the right
and left eigen-operators of M for eigenvalue mi and obey
⟨⟨ℓ̂i |r̂j ⟩⟩ = δi,j .
We initialize the MERA in the product state |0⟩ =
|0, . . . , 0⟩ at the topmost (infinite) layer. The expectation
value of a local observable Ô0,1 with the scale-invariant
MERA then is

are exactly zero for all i and local operators Ôi and Ôj′
whenever δℓ ≥ ξmax − 3 + k.
Hence, all local observables, two-point correlation
functions, and subsystem density matrices for blocks of
ℓ ≤ ξmax sites of an infinite MERA coincide with those

T →∞

See Fig. 6(d). Experimentally, we cannot directly implement MERA with an infinite number of layers. Instead,
we truncate after layer T and use the top layer to prepare
a two-site state ϱ̂′ that maximizes the contribution of the
dominant eigenmode ϱ̂steady of the layer-transition channel (C1). This is achieved by choosing the gate angles

FIG. 5. Holographic subsystem tomography and entanglement scaling. An infinite binary MERA with T layers is
consistent with a MERA on 6 × 2T sites with periodic boundary conditions. Here, T = 3, resulting in a total of 6 × 23 = 48
sites. All connected two-point correlation functions for sites of distance ≥ 3 × 2T − 2 = 22 are exactly zero. For example,
⟨X̂10 Ŷ31 ⟩ − ⟨X̂10 ⟩⟨Ŷ31 ⟩ can be nonzero while ⟨X̂10 Ŷ32 ⟩ − ⟨X̂10 ⟩⟨Ŷ32 ⟩ ≡ 0. This is due to the fact that, in the latter case,
the causal cones of the two operators have no overlap. Similarly, for any bipartition of the system into equally sized blocks
like A = {26, . . . , 47, 0, 1} and B = {2, . . . , 25}, the causal cones of the two subsystem boundaries do not overlap. Hence,
measurements of the renormalized sites at the two boudnaries are independent of each other, i.e., follow a product distribution.

tomography on T qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone circuit (see also Fig. 5).

append T − 1 layers of the scale-invariant MERA to refine the dominant eigenmode as shown in Fig. 6(e). This
approach is highly effective as demonstrated for T = 5
and a few local observables in Secs. III A and III B 1.
To account for layer truncations in the study of subsystem purity and entanglement, we introduce a doubled SWAP-contracted layer-transition map D as shown
in Fig. 6(c). For a scale-invariant MERA truncated after layer T and initialized with the reference state |0⟩,
the purity of subsystem B = [2, ∞) can be computed by
iteratively applying D to the (doubled) zero-product reference state |0, 0⟩⟨0, 0| at the topmost layer and taking

where the large-T limit is taken in the last line, and |0, 0⟩⟩
represents the projector |0, 0⟩⟨0, 0|. Hence, the entanglement entropy should increase linearly with T , i.e., by a
constant in each renormalization step.
Even with the small bond dimension χ = 2, the dominant eigenvalue d0 of D in the optimized scale invariant
MERA agrees well with the conformal field theory prediction for the Ising model with central charge c = 1/2:
−8 log2 d0 = 0.475 . . . ≈ c.

(C5)

Again, we truncate the scale-invariant MERA after
layer T ≤ 4 for experiments. To mitigate the effect of
the truncation, we do not initialize with the reference
state |0⟩ at the top layer but with a more suitable twosite state |φ⟩, generated from |0⟩ through one entangling
and further single-qubit gates. These gates are chosen to
suppress subleading contributions in (C4) by minimizP

After implementing such T -layer approximations of a
scale-invariant MERA in the experiment, we perform
the holographic subsystem tomography, measuring all T
qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone as
discussed in Sec. A and illustrated in Fig. 6(g).

Appendix D: Gate compilation and circuit examples

In the main text and previous appendices, we showed
tensor network diagrams of MERA and schematic gate
decompositions of individual tensors. Here, we demonstrate how to compile these into native quantum gates
and provide concrete circuit examples for measuring both
local observables and nonlocal entanglement properties.
As shown in Fig. 7(a), a generic 4-by-4 unitary operation can be decomposed into a two-qubit circuit using
3 entangling gates and 12 single-qubit gates, involving a
total of 15 parameters (up to a global phase). However,
this generic decomposition turns out to be unnecessary
for our MERA circuits. For example, in a network of
such two-qubit unitaries, redundant single-qubit gates on
connected bonds can be eliminated. More importantly, a
physically motivated ansatz should preserve the symmetries of the Hamiltonian, except in cases of spontaneous
symmetry breaking.
For the transverse-field Ising model studied here, the
ground state exhibits time-reversal symmetry (invariance
under complex conjugation in the computational basis)
for all values of g and a Z2 symmetry when g ≤ 1. While
a global symmetry does not necessarily imply local symmetry, we find that, in our case, it does hold locally. A
suitable choice of entangling gates that respect the symmetries of the Ising model includes XY (θ) = e−iθX̂⊗Ŷ /2
and YX(θ) = e−iθŶ ⊗X̂/2 , which are real in the computational basis and respect the model’s Z2 symmetry as
[⊗i Ẑi , XY (θ)] = 0. Based on this, we replace XX and
Y Y gates with XY and YX gates. We remove ZZ and
single-qubit Z gates as they violate time-reversal symmetry. Variable Ry (θ) = e−iθŶ /2 gates are retained in
some tensors to allow for spontaneous breaking of the Z2
symmetry. The Ry gates that have been removed only
have a relatively small effect on the accuracy.
The resulting refined gate compilation for a unit cell
in the binary MERA, including one isometry and one
unitary (dis)entangler, is shown in Fig. 7(b). This
symmetry-respecting compilation significantly reduces
the parameter space and redundancy without sacrificing expressiveness in approximating the ground state, as
confirmed by our numerical simulations. Since binary
MERA with one qubit per bond is classically simulable, we do not implement the variational MERA on the
quantum computer. Instead, we classically optimize the
MERA with the gate configuration in Fig. 7(b). Notably,
while the Ry gate is retained for all values of g, the optimized angles are non-zero only when g < 1 within our
data points, which is consistent with the presence of a
non-zero order parameter in the ferromagnetic phase.
In our experimental setup, the native entangling gate is
the XX gate. As shown in Fig. 7(c), we convert the XY
and YX gates into native gates by appending additional
virtual Rz (± π2 ) rotations, which are effectively free, as
mentioned in Sec. II C.

servables and subsystem entanglement can be probed by
preparing only the causal cone state (unshaded regions
in Figs. 1 and 5), rather than the full MERA circuit.
Fig. 7(d) presents a concrete example of such a circuit.
From left to right, 8 qubits are initialized in the |0⟩ state,
followed by layers of gates grouped into either isometry
or (dis)entangler tensors. Finally, the desired observables
are measured. In this circuit example, measurements on
qubits 3 and 4 yield local observables on spin sites 0 and
1 as indicated in Fig. 1, while qubits 5, 6, and 7 are used
to evaluate the entanglement between the subsystems A
and B consisting of spin sites (−∞, 1] and [2, ∞), respectively.

1.

State preparation and measurement error

State preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors
contribute significantly to our error budget. To quantify the probability pd of SPAM errors for the dark state
(|0⟩), we performed fluorescence detection after initializing all qubits via the usual optical pumping, yielding
an average measured error of 0.16% (see Fig. 8 for detailed SPAM errors). To measure the probability pb of
SPAM errors for the bright state (|1⟩), we applied Ry (π)
gates following the optical pumping and then performed
fluorescence detection, yielding an average measured error of 0.45% (see Fig. 8 for detailed SPAM errors). We
checked the rotation error of the Ry (π) gates by applying

nine consecutive Ry (π)-gates, yielding a population error
of 0.56+0.17
−0.12 % as determined by the binomial proportionate 95% confidence interval using the Clopper-Pearson
method. The population error resulting from single-qubit
gates should scale superlinearly with the number N of
gates, corresponding to a mixture of uncorrelated and
correlated noise. Our results imply a population error
below 10−3 per π-gate, which is below the determined
bright-state SPAM error.
The measurement error for the 171 Yb+ hyperfine
qubits arises from optical pumping between the hyperfine states during the optical detection pulse [66, 67]. We
fit the measured photon count statistics at various detection time τ to an optical pumping model as discussed
below to determine the state preparation error and the
measurement errors.
The distributions of detection counts for a single ion
prepared in the bright state for different detection times
are shown in Fig. 9(a). Ideally, the ion would cycle between the |S, F = 1⟩ and |P, F = 0⟩ manifolds, resulting
in a Poisson distribution of the recorded photon counts.
However, the bright state can be off-resonantly pumped
to the dark hyperfine ground state via the |S, F = 1⟩ →
|P, F = 1⟩ transition detuned by 2.1 GHz with a rate Rb
that is about 5 × 104 times lower than the bright-state
photon scattering rate Γsc . Neglecting the even slower
dark-to-bright pumping process, the predicted distribution of the bright-state photon counts are

inversely proportional to the fitted variances to obtain
Rb = 3.0(1) × 102 /s. The detection count statistics for
a single ion prepared in the dark |S, F = 0⟩ state are
shown in Fig. 9(b). The dark state can be off-resonantly
pumped to the bright manifold via the 14.7-GHz detuned

is about 106 times lower than Γsc . Neglecting the reverse

Fitting this model to the count data for photon number
nph > 1 in Fig. 9(b) yields Rd = 18(1)/s. The obtained
ratio of Rb and Rd is close to the theoretical prediction
in Ref. [68].
To distinguish the preparation error from the measure-

ment error, we fitted the average dark-state photon number as a function of detection time τ (Fig. 10) to the rate
equation model from Ref. [68]:

where p is the state preparation error probability. Here,
Pb,∞ = (Rb /Rd + 1)−1 and Pd,∞ = 1 − Pb,∞ are the
equilibrium bright and dark-state populations, respectively. The fitted value p = 10(6) × 10−5 confirms that
our SPAM error is dominated by the measurement errors,
as p ≪ pd , pb .
To model state-preparation error in the numerical simulations, we flip each qubit with probability p. To simulate the detection error, after applying the circuit and
measuring in the computational basis {|0⟩, |1⟩}, we randomly flip |0⟩ → |1⟩ with probability pd − p and |1⟩ → |0⟩
with probability pb − p.

are compatible with our experimental setup.

Idling noise

We characterized the dephasing of idle qubits using
a Ramsey pulse sequence. After applying Ry ( π2 ) gates
to all 13 qubits, we simulated idling by turning off the
individual-addressing Raman beams while keeping the
global beam on with the same settings as during a gate
sequence. After a variable idle time τidle , we completed
the Ramsey sequence with Rz (ϕ) and Ry ( π2 ) gates and
recorded the |1⟩ state population as a function of ϕ. We
obtained the fitted ion-averaged contrast C from
the re∗
sulting fringes and modeled it as A e−τidle /T2 . Fig. 11
shows a representative fit from a sample dataset, yielding
A = 0.991(1) and T2∗ = 300(17) ms. The deviation of the
fitted value of A from 1 mainly reflects SPAM errors, with
additional contributions potentially arising from residual
single-qubit gate errors and qubit addressing and detection crosstalk. From several datasets collected on different experimental days, the fitted T2∗ ranges from 260 ms

Gate errors

a.

Axial motion

Axial motion of our 15-ion chain, dominated by the
lowest-frequency axial mode (mode 0) with angular frequency ω0 = 2π × 241.8 kHz, is a leading error source in
our platform. This motion misaligns the ions relative to
the tightly-focused addressing beams, causing gate errors
[65]. These errors increase over time as the ions’ motion
is driven by noisy electric fields.
We quantified the addressing error after a wait time t
following laser cooling by applying a variable number N
of XX( π2 ) gates of total duration ∆t to ions i and j and
measuring the mean population P|11⟩ of the |1, 1⟩ state.
The recorded populations P|11⟩ as a function of N for
(i, j) = (3, −3) are shown in the inset of Fig. 12. Uncertainty in the ions’ axial motion translates into a variance
in the total XX rotation angle, leading to damping of
P|11⟩ oscillations.
The observed damping is governed by the statistics of
the phonon number of mode 0 during gate application
[65]. We model the evolution of the phonon number nt
at time t as a biased random walk. Since the energy of
mode 0 following laser cooling corresponds to hundreds
of phonons, and the average heating per XX gate corresponds to more than 20 phonons, we coarse-grain nt on
intervals of size δn with 1 ≤ δn ≪ 2nt and model the
random walk as

X-errors

We describe X-errors during an XX(θ) gate on ion pair
(i, j) using a bit-flip channel acting on the density matrix
ρ̂ of ion i as
EX (ρ̂) = (1 − pX )ρ̂ + pX X̂ ρ̂X̂,

(E8)

where pX ≡ pX,i,j (θ) is the X-flip probability per gate.
X-errors can be caused by residual spin-motion entanglement at the end of Mølmer-Sørensen gates. They
can be minimized by carefully choosing the motional detuning, gate duration, and envelope of the amplitudemodulated gate waveforms [70]. In-between experiment
runs, we stabilized frequencies of the radial ion-motion
modes via blue-sideband Ramsey spectroscopy. Each of
the central 11 qubits was used to query one of 11 radial
modes that are addressed by the entangling gate waveforms. The obtained spectroscopical data was used to
automatically adjust the quadratic and quartic terms in
the static axial potential of the trap and a common motional offset frequency for all gates.
After applying N consecutive XX( π2 ) gates to the |0, 0⟩
state on ions i and j, we measured the probability of X-

is a rescaled phase shift on ion i.

To measure Stark shifts during a specific XX gate, we
insert N pairs of XX( π2 ) − XX(− π2 ) gates into a Ramsey pulse sequence consisting of initial Ry ( π2 ) and final
Rz (ϕ) − Ry ( π2 ) pulses applied to each targeted ion. After
adjusting the qubit frequencies during the gate to compensate for the measured shifts, we use the same sequence
to estimate any residual gate Z-errors.
The fitted contrast of the obtained Ramsey fringes for a
sample gate is shown in Fig. 14(a). The observed dependence of the contrast on N is roughly quadratic, indicating that the phase shift error accumulates coherently as
the number of gates increases. We model the observed decoherence by correlated fluctuations in the gate-induced
Stark shift, which can arise from fluctuations in the amplitude balance of the red and blue tones of the MølmerSørensen gate due to air turbulence in the Raman beam
setup. Since our Ramsey sequence prepares the qubits
in the X-basis, we do not expect gate X-errors to affect
the measured contrast. We assume that the phase shift
ϕi induced on ion i by a fully-entangling XX gate during
each shot follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean
and standard deviation σϕi . This noise model results in a
i 2

fringe contrast proportional to e−(N σϕ ) /2 to first order.
Figure 14 show fits of this model to the measured contrast

Appendix F: Breakdown of error contributions

To better understand our experimental results, we analyze the breakdown of error contributions through numerical simulation. As shown in Fig. 15, we selected two
representative cases from Fig. 4 of the main text, one
with the highest reported infidelity 1 − F (∼ 10−2 ) and
one with the lowest (∼ 10−4 ).
The case of highest reported infidelity corresponds to a
4-qubit tomography result on a 4-layer MERA circuit at
the critical point g = 1. The circuit involves 9 qubits and
21 XX gates with rotation amplitudes ranging from 0.06π
to 0.18π. We performed 1,500 measurement shots per basis over a total of 34 = 81 measurement bases. Based on
our error model and the calibrated parameters provided
in the Appendix E, we identify several key sources of error. First, there is the inevitable statistical uncertainty
in the measured density matrix elements on the order of
∼ 10−2 from the finite number of measurement shots.
Second, aggregated SPAM errors for the 4-qubit tomography are on the order of ∼ 10−2 . The dominant gate
error arises from rotation-angle fluctuations caused by
axial motion of the ion chain, which, for fully-entangling

FIG. 15. Breakdown of error contributions. The top row (a,c) shows the first eigenvalues ζ0 of the entanglement
Hamiltonian, and the bottom row (b,d) shows corresponding state infidelities 1 − F . The left column (a,b) presents results
at the critical point g = 1 with T = 4, while the right column (c,d) corresponds to the gapped phase at g = 1.5 with T = 1.
Experimental data points with error bars are reproduced from Fig. 4 in the main text. The dashed lines indicate the ideal
simulation results from Fig. 4. Noisy simulation results are shown as shaded regions representing the 95% quantiles, with solid
colored lines indicating the mean values. In the “full noise” case, we reproduce the full noisy simulation including all error
sources from Fig. 4. In the “shot only” case, all errors are disabled except for shot noise (the statistical uncertainty due to
the finite number of measurement shots). In the remaining cases, the simulations include both the shot noise and the specified
individual error source. We run 1000 independent noisy simulation trials for each case. Each trail uses the same number of
measurement shots as the experiment: 1,500 shots per basis per trial in the left column, and 8,000 shots per basis per trial in
the right column.

gates, typically leads to errors on the order of 10−2 . After
accounting for the error rescaling due to smaller rotation
angles in the actual MERA gates and the accumulation
of errors throughout the circuit, the overall gate-induced
error is also expected to be in the 10−2 range. This estimate is confirmed in Fig. 15(a). A small discrepancy
remains between the experimental data and the full-noise
simulation, which we attribute to system miscalibration
over the long experimental runtime required for 4-qubit
tomography, as well as unmodeled single-qubit gate errors.
The case of lowest reported infidelity corresponds to a
single-qubit tomography result on a single-layer MERA
circuit in the gapped phase at g = 1.5. The circuit involves only 2 qubits and a single XX gate with a rotation
amplitude of 0.095π. We performed 8,000 measurement
shots for each Pauli-X, -Y , and -Z basis. In this case,
the statistical uncertainty from finite sampling is on the
order of 10−3 ∼ 10−2 , while the SPAM error for a single
qubit is on the order of 10−3 , and the error from the single gate is also on the order of 10−3 . Hence, we expect
the statistical uncertainty to dominate over other error
sources, which is consistent with the simulation results
shown in Fig. 15(c).
We observe that the infidelity is of comparable magni-

tude to the errors for the high-infidelity case in Fig. 15(b)
and at least an order of magnitude below the error scale
for the low-infidelity case in Fig. 15(d). We attribute this
to the fact that the infidelity has different scaling behavior for rank-deficient and full-rank states: Consider the
exact (noise-free) density operator ρ̂ and the perturbed
version σ̂ = ρ̂ + ϵD̂ with noise level ϵ and Tr(D̂) = 0.
For a full-rank state ρ̂, the perturbed σ̂ remains welldefined (positive semidefinite) for sufficiently small ϵ > 0
as well as small ϵ < 0. The infidelity 1 − F(ρ̂, σ̂(ϵ)) is
differentiable and minimal at ϵ = 0. This implies that
the linear term vanishes and 1 − F = O(ϵ2 ). This is
the case in Fig. 15(d), where the corresponding singlequbit reduced density matrix has full rank with eigenvalues {0.98, 2.2 × 10−2 }. A linear scaling 1 − F = O(ϵ)
is only possible for rank-deficient states. For example,
consider a pure state ρ̂ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and the perturbation
D̂ = −|ψ⟩⟨ψ| + |ψ⊥ ⟩⟨ψ⊥ | with an orthogonal state |ψ⊥ ⟩
and ϵ ≥ 0. In this case, the infidelity is simply ϵ. In the
current experiments, the ideal reduced density matrix is
indeed approximately rank-deficient at larger layer numbers T , and this is the case in Fig. 15(b) with eigenvalues
{0.92, 7.9 × 10−2 , 3.5 × 10−3 , 3.1 × 10−4 , 2.7 × 10−4 , 2.7 ×
10−5 , . . . }.
