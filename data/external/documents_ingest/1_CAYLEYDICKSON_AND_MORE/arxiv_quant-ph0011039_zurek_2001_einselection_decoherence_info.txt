                                           We introduce and investigate a simple model of conditional quantum dynamics. It allows
                                       for a discussion of the information-theoretic aspects of quantum measurements, decoherence,
                                       and environment-induced superselection (einselection).

                                       1   Introduction

                                       Transfer of information was the focus of attention [1-3] of research on decoherence
                                       since the early days. In the intervening two decades this perspective was not forgotten
                                       [4], but the study of different mechanisms of decoherence [5-9] took precedence over
                                       considerations of information-theoretic nature. The aim of this paper is to sketch a few
                                       ideas which tie the “traditional” points of view of einselection and decoherence (espe-
                                       cially the issue of the preferred pointer basis) to various other aspects of decoherence
                                       that have a strong connection with information-theoretic concepts.
                                           A large part of our discussion shall be based on a simple model of conditional
                                       dynamics, which is a direct generalization of the “bit by bit” measurement introduced
                                       in [1] and studied in [3]. We shall introduce the model in Section 2 and use it to
                                       compute the “price” of information in units of action in Section 3. Section 4 defines
                                       information theoretic quantum discord between two classically identical definitions of
                                       mutual information. Discord can be regarded as a measure of a violation of classicality
                                       of a joint state of two quantum subsystems. Section 5 turns to the evolution of the state
                                       of the environment in course of decoherence. The redundancy ratio introduced there
                                       can be regarded as a measure of objectivity of quantum states. A large redundancy
                                       ratio is a sufficient condition for an effective classicality of quantum states.

2     Controlled shifts for conditional dynamics

The simplest example of an entangling quantum evolution is known as the controlled
not (c-not). It involves two bits (a “control” and a “target”). Their interaction leads
to:
       |0C i|xT i −→ |0C i|xT i                                                     (1a)

       |1C i|xT i −→ |1C i|¬xT i                                                    (1b)

where the state |¬xi is defined through a basis-dependent negation:
       ¬(γ|0T i + η|1T i) = γ|1T i + η|0T i .                                        (2)
Classical c-not “flips” the target bit whenever the control is in the state “1”, but does
nothing otherwise. Quantum c-not is an obvious generalization.
    The distinction between the classical and quantum c-not comes from the fact that
both quantum and classical bits can be in an arbitrary superposition. Thus, c-not
starting from a superposition of |0i and |1i will in general lead to an entangled state.
Moreover, when both the control and the target start in Hadamard-transformed states:
                        √
      |±i = (|0i ± |1i)/ 2 ,                                                          (3)
c-not reverses direction:
       |±i|+i −→ |±i|+i;                                                            (4a)

       |±i|−i −→ |∓i|−i .                                                           (4b)

Above, we have dropped labels: The original control is always to the left, as was the
case in Eq. (1). We say “the original”, because the Hadamard transform of Eq. (3)
reverses the direction of the information flow in the quantum c-not. As can be seen
in Eq. (4), the sign of the former control (left ket) flips when the former target is in
the state |−i.
    Study of such simple models has led to the concept of preferred pointer states
[1] and einselection [2,3]. We shall not review here these well known developments,
directing the reader instead to the already available [10] or forthcoming [11] reviews
of the subject.
    Controlled shift (c-shift) is a straightforward generalization of c-not. The orig-
inal truth table (an analogue of Eq. (1)) can be written as:
       |sj i|Ak i −→ |sj i|Ak+j i                                                    (5)
There is also a control and a target (which we shall more often call “the system S” and
“the apparatus A”, reflecting this nomenclature in notation). Equation (5) implies
Eq. (1) when both S and A have two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Moreover, when
j = 0, Eq. (1) becomes a model of a pre-measurement:
                                       !
                          X                      X
      |Ψ0 i = |ψi|A0 i =       ai |si i |A0 i −→   ai |si i|Ai i = |Ψt i .           (6)
                              i                  i
W. H. Zurek, Einselection and Decoherence                                                                    857

As in the case of c-not, in the respective bases {|si i} and {|Ak i}, Eq. (5) seems to
imply a one - way flow of information, from S to A. However, a complementary basis
[12,13] can be readily defined:
                             N −1
                         1
                             X              2πi
     |Bk i = N − 2                   exp(       kl) |Al i .                                                   (7)
                                             N
                               l=0

It is analogous to the Hadamard transform we have introduced before, but it also
has an obvious affinity to the Fourier transform. We shall call it a Hadamard-Fourier
Transform (HFT). It is straightforward to show that the orthonormality of {|Ak i}
immediately implies:
     hBl |Bm i = δlm .                                                                                        (8)
The inverse of HFT can be easily given:
                             N −1
                         1
                             X                2πi
     |Ak i = N − 2                   exp(−        kl) |Bl i .                                                 (9)
                                               N
                               l=0

Consequently, for an arbitrary |ψi;
           X              X
     |ψi =     αn |An i =    βk |Bk i ,                                                                      (10)
               n                       k

where the coefficients are given by the HFT;
                        N −1
                    1
                        X              2πi
     βk = N − 2                exp(−       kn)αn .                                                           (11)
                        n=0
                                        N

To implement the truth table of Eq. (5) we shall use observables of the apparatus:
            N
            X −1
     Â =          k|Ak ihAk |;                                                                             (12a)
            k=0

            N
            X −1
     B̂ =           l|Bl ihBl | ,                                                                           (12b)
             l=0

as well as the observable of the system:
            N
            X −1
     ŝ =          l|sl ihsl | .                                                                             (13)
            l=0

The interaction Hamiltonian of the form;
     Hint = gŝB̂                                                                                            (14)
acting over a period t will induce a transition;
                                                                  N −1
                                                              1
                                                                  X
      exp(−iHint t/h̄)|sj i|Ak i = |sj > N − 2                           exp[−i(jgt/h̄ + 2πk/N )l]|Bl i .    (15)
                                                                  l=0
858                                                         Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) 9 (2000) 5

Thus, if the coupling constant g is selected so that the associated action is

       I = gt/h̄ = G × 2π/N .                                                         (16)

a perfect one-to-one correlation between the states of the system and of the apparatus
can be accomplished, since:

       exp(−iHint t/h̄)|sj i|Ak i = |sj i|A{k+G∗j}N i .                               (17)

Thus, true to its name, the interaction described here accomplishes a simple shift,
Eq. (5), of the state of the apparatus, while the system acts as a control. The index
{k + G ∗ j}N has to be evaluated modulo N (where N is the number of the orthogonal
states of the apparatus) so that when k + G ∗ j > N , the apparatus states can “rotate”
through |A0 i and stop where the interaction takes it. The integer G can be regarded
as the gain factor. As Eqs. (14) - (17) imply, the adjacent states of the system (i.e.,
|sj i, |sj+1 i) get mapped onto the states of the apparatus that are G apart “on the
dial”.
     When the dimension of the Hilbert space of the system n is such that

       nG < N ,                                                                       (18)

the above model provides one with a simple example of amplification. It is possible
to use it to study the utility of amplification in increasing signal to noise ratio in
measurements [11]. It also shows why amplification can bring about decoherence and
effective irreversibility (although c-shift is of course perfectly reversible). We shall
employ c-shift to study the cost of information transfer, to introduce information –
theoretic discord, the measure of the classicality of correlations, and to discuss objec-
tivity of quantum states which arises from the redundancy of the records imprinted
by the state of the system on its environment.


3     Planck’s constant and the price of a bit

Transfer of information is the objective of the measurement process and an inevitable
consequence of most interactions. It happens in course of decoherence. Here we shall
quantify its cost in the units of action.
    The consequence of the interaction between S and A is the correlated state |Ψt i,
Eq. (6). While the joint state of AS is pure, each of the subsystems is in a mixed
state given by the reduced density matrix of the system
                               N
                               X −1
       ρS = TrA |Ψt ihΨt | =          |ai |2 |si ihsi | ;                            (19a)
                                i=0

and of the apparatus
                               N
                               X −1
       ρA = TrS |Ψt ihΨt | =          |ai |2 |Ai ihAi | .                            (19b)
                                i=0
W. H. Zurek, Einselection and Decoherence                                                 859

    The correlation brought about by the interaction, Eq. (6), leads to the loss of
information about S and A individually. The entropy of each increases to
                                        N
                                        X −1
     HS = −TrρS log ρS = −                     |ai |2 log |ai |2 = −TrρA log ρA = HA .    (20)
                                        i=0

As the evolution of the whole AS is unitary, the entropies of the subsystems must
be compensated by the decrease of their mutual entropy, i.e., by the increase of their
mutual information:
                                                      N
                                                      X −1
     I(S : A) = HS + HA − HSA = −2                           |ai |2 log |ai |2            (21)
                                                      i=0

Above, HSA is the joint entropy of SA. This quantity, Eq. (21), was introduced in
the quantum context as a measure of entanglement some time ago [3] and has been
since rediscovered and used [14].
    The cost of a bit of information in terms of some other physical quantity is an
often raised question. In the context of our model we shall inquire what is the cost of
a bit transfer in terms of action. Let us then consider a transition represented by Eq.
(6). The associated action must be no less than
          N
          X −1
     I=          |aj |2 arccos |hA0 |Aj i| .                                              (22)
          j=0

When {|Aj i} are mutually orthogonal, the action is:
     I = π/2                                                                             (23a)
in Planck (h = 2πh̄) units. This estimate can be lowered by using a judiciously chosen
initial |A0 i which is a superposition of the outcomes |Aj i. For a two-dimensional
Hilbert space the average action can be thus brought down to πh̄/4 [1,3]. In general,
an interaction of the form
                  N
                  X −1                N
                                      X −1
     HSA = ig            |sk ihsk |         (|Ak ihAl | − |Al ihAk |)                     (24)
                   k=0                l=0

saturates at the lower bound given by
                 p
      I = arcsin 1 − 1/N .                                                               (23b)
As the dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces increases, the least action approaches π/2
per completely entangling interaction. The action per bit will be less when, for a given
N , the transferred information is maximized, which happens when |ai |2 = 1/N in Eq.
(22). Then the cost of information in Planck units is
            I         π
     ι=         ≈          .                                                              (25)
          log N   2 log2 N
The cost of information per bit decreases with increasing N , the dimension of the
Hilbert space of the smaller of the two entangled systems.

    This result is at the same time both enlightening and disappointing: It shows that
the cost of information transfer is not “fixed” (as one might have hoped). Rather, the
least total amount of action needed for a complete entanglement is at least asymptot-
ically fixed as Eqs. (23) show. Consequently, the least price per bit goes down when
information is transferred “wholesale”, i.e., when N is large. Yet, this is enlightening,
as it may indicate why in the classical continuous world (where N is effectively infinite)
one may be ignorant of that price and convinced that information is free.


4     Discord

Mutual information can be defined either by the symmetric formula, Eq. (21), or
through an asymmetric looking equation which employs conditional entropy:
       J (S : A) = HS − HS|A                                                         (26)
Above, HS|A expresses the average ignorance of S remaining after the observer has
found out the state of A. In classical physics, the two formulae, Eqs. (21) and (26),
are strictly identical, so that the discord between them:
       δI = I(S : A) − J (S : A) = 0                                                (27a)
always disappears [15]:
       δI = 0 .                                                                     (27b)
In quantum physics things are never this simple: To begin with, conditional informa-
tion depends on the observer finding out about one of the subsystems, which implies
a measurement. So HS|A must be carefully defined before Eqs. (26) and (27) become
meaningful.
    Conditional entropy is non-trivial in the quantum context because, in general, in
order to find out HS|A one must choose a set of projection operators Πj and define a
conditional density matrix given by the outcome corresponding to Πj through
       ρ̃S|Πj = TrA Πj ρSA ,                                                         (28)
where in the simplest case Πj = |Cj ihCj | is a projection operator onto a pure state
of the apparatus. A normalized ρS|Πj can be obtained by using the probability of the
outcome
       pj = Trρ̃S|Πj ;                                                               (29)

       ρS|Πj = p−1
                j ρ̃S|Πj .                                                           (30)
    The conditional density matrix ρS|Πj represents the description of the system S
available to the observer who knows that the apparatus A is in a subspace defined by
Πj . For a pure initial state and an exhaustive measurement the conditional density
matrix will also be pure. We shall however consider a broader range of possibilities,
including joint density matrices which undergo a decoherence process, so that
              X                                 X
      ρP
       SA =      αi α∗j |si ihsj ||Ai ihAj | =⇒   |αi |2 |si ihsi ||Ai ihAi | = ρD
                                                                                 SA . (31)
                i,j                         i
W. H. Zurek, Einselection and Decoherence                                           861

This transition is accompanied by an increase in entropy

     ∆H(ρSA ) = H(ρD         P
                   SA ) − H(ρSA )

and by the simultaneous disappearance of the ambiguity in what was measured [1-3].
Now, ρS|Πj is no longer pure, unless Πj = |Aj ihAj |. That is, a measurement of the
apparatus in bases other than the pointer basis will leave an observer with varying
degrees of ignorance about the state of the system. More general cases when the
density matrix is neither a pure pre-decoherence projection operator ρPSA to the left of
the arrow in Eq. (31) nor a completely decohered ρD  SA state on the right are possible
and typical.
   To define discord δI we finalize our definition of HS|A :
              X
     HS|A =        p|Ci i H(ρD
                             S|Ci i ) .                                            (32)
               i

Above, we have used an obvious notation for the density matrix conditioned upon pure
states {|Cj i}. We emphasize again that the conditional entropy depends on ρSA , but
also on the choice of the observable measured on A. In classical physics all observables
commute, so there is no such dependence. Thus, non-commutation of observables in
quantum theory is the ultimate source of the information - theoretic discord.
    The obvious use for the discord is to employ it as a measure of how non-classical
the underlying correlation of two quantum systems is. In particular, when there exists
a set of states in one of the two systems in which the discord disappears, the state
represented by ρSA admits a classical interpretation of probabilities in that special
basis. Moreover, unless the discord disappears for trivial reasons (which would happen
in the absence of correlation, i.e., when ρSA = ρS ρA ), the basis which minimizes the
discord can be regarded as “the most classical”. For δI = 0 the states of such preferred
basis and their corresponding eigenvalues can be treated as effectively classical [11].
    The vanishing discord is a stronger condition than the absence of entanglement.
In effect, δI = 0 implies existence of the eigenstates of ρSA which are products of the
states of S and of A. An instructive example of this situation arises as a result of
decoherence: When the off-diagonal terms of ρSA disappear in a manner illustrated
by Eq. (31), the discord disappears as well.



5   Environment as a witness: Redundancy ratio

The discussion of decoherence to date tends to focus on the effect of the environment
on the system or on the apparatus. The destruction of quantum coherence and the
emergence of preferred pointer observables whose eigenvalues are associated with the
decoherence-free pointer subspaces was the focus of the investigation.
    Here we shall break with this tradition. According to the theory of decoherence,
the environment is monitoring the system. Therefore, its state must contain a record
of the system. It is of obvious interest to analyze the nature and the role of this
record. To this end, we shall use mutual information introduced before defining the
862                                                       Ann. Phys. (Leipzig) 9 (2000) 5

redundancy ratio
                                    !
                     X
      RI (⊗HE ) =          I(S : E k ) /H(S) .                                        (33)
               k
                       k

Above, we imagined a setting where the system is decohering due to the interaction
with the environment which is composed of many subsystems Ek . RI ({⊗HE }) is a
                                                                              k
measure of how many times – how redundantly – the information about the system has
been inscribed in the environment. An essentially identical formula can be introduced
using the asymmetric J , Eq. (26). It is easy to establish that the discord is always
non-negative and, hence, that

      RJM AX ≤ RIM AX .                                                               (34)

The subscript indicating maximization may refer to two distinct procedures: RJ will
obviously depend on the manner in which subsystems of the environment are measured.
In fact, it is convenient to use

      Jk = J (S : E k ) = H(Ek ) − H(Ek |S) ,                                         (35)

to define a basis-dependent

      RJ ({|si}) = RJ (⊗HE k )                                                        (36)

in a manner analogous to Eq. (33). Maximizing RJ ({|si}) with respect to the choice
of the choice of states {|si} [11] is an obvious “counterpoint” to the predictability sieve
[16-19], the strategy which seeks states that entangle the least with the environment.
    There is one more maximization procedure which may and should be considered:
The environment can be partitioned differently – for example, it may turn out that
more information about the system can be extracted by measuring, say, the photon
environment in some collective fashion (homodyne?) instead of directly counting the
environment photons. It is clear that for such optimization to be physically significant,
it should respect to some degree the natural structure of the environment.
    In addition to the redundancy ratio one can define the rate at which the redundancy
ratio increases. The redundancy rate is defined as
             d
      Ṙ =      R.                                                                    (37)
             dt
Either the basis dependent or the basis-independent versions of Ṙ may be of interest.
The physical significance of the redundancy ratio rate is clear: It shows how quickly
the information about the system spreads throughout the environment. It is, in effect,
a measure of the rate of increase of the effective number of the environment subsystems
which have recorded the state of the system S.
   It is worth noting that either RI or RJ can keep on increasing after the density
matrix of the system has lost its off-diagonal terms in the pointer basis and after it
can be therefore considered completely decohered. Indeed, direct interaction between
the system and the environment is not needed for either R to change. For example,
W. H. Zurek, Einselection and Decoherence                                               863

information about the system inscribed in the primary environment may be communi-
cated to a secondary, tertiary, and more remote environment (which need not interact
with the system at all).
    It is natural to define objectivity and, therefore, classicality with the help of R. In
the limit RJ → ∞ the information about the preferred states of the system is spread
so widely that it can be acquired by many observers simultaneously [11]. Moreover, it
already exists in multiple copies, so it can be safely cloned in spite of the no-cloning
theorem [20]. Thus, a state of the system redundantly recorded in the environment
has all the symptoms of “objective existence”. In particular, such well-advertised
states can be found out without being disturbed by approximately R observers acting
independently [11,21] (each simply measuring the state of ∼ 1/RJ fraction of the
environment).


6   Summary and Conclusions

Information theory offers a useful perspective on the measurement process, on de-
coherence and, above all, on the definitions of classicality. Discord can be used to
characterize the nature of quantum correlations and to distinguish the ones that are
classical. The redundancy ratio is a powerful measure of the classicality of states:
While a vanishing discord is a necessary condition for classicality of correlations, the
redundancy ratio is a direct measure of objective existence of quantum states. Ob-
jectivity can be defined operationally as the ability to find what the state is without
disturbing it [11,21]. Objective existence of quantum states would make them effec-
tively classical, and was the ultimate goal of the interpretation of quantum theory.
We have established it here by investigating einselection from the point of view of
information theory and by shifting focus from the system to the environment which is
monitoring the system.
    These advances clarify some of the interpretational issues which are now a cen-
tury old. The relation between the epistemological and ontological significance of the
quantum state vectors is now apparent: Objective existence of the quantum states is
a direct consequence of the redundant records permeating the environment. Episte-
mology begets ontology!
