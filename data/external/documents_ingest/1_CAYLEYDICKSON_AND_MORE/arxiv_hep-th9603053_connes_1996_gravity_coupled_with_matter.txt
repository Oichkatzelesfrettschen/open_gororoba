                                          Abstract. We first exhibit in the commutative case the simple al-
                                          gebraic relations between the algebra of functions on a manifold and
                                          its infinitesimal length element ds. Its unitary representations cor-
                                          respond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while ds is the
                                          Dirac propagator ds = ×—× = D−1 where D is the Dirac operator.
                                          We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using
                                          Tomita’s involution J. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a
                                          function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to
                                          the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown
                                          (in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian
                                          coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative
                                          geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic
                                          sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non
                                          commutative case. The group of local gauge transformations appears
                                          spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the diffeomorphism group.




                                        Riemann’s concept of a geometric space is based on the notion of a manifold
                                    M whose points x ∈ M are locally labelled by a finite number of real coordinates
                                    xµ ∈ R. The metric data is given by the infinitesimal length element,

                                    (1)                             ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν

                                    which allows to measure distances between two points x, y as the infimum of the

                                                                            1
length of arcs x(t) from x to y,
                                                Z y
(2)                             d(x, y) = Inf         ds .
                                                 x

In this paper we shall build our notion of geometry, in a very similar but somehow
dual manner, on the pair (A, ds) of the algebra A of coordinates and the infinite-
simal length element ds. For the start we only consider ds as a symbol, which
together with A generates an algebra (A, ds). The length element ds does not
commute with the coordinates, i.e. with the functions f on our space, f ∈ A.
But it does satisfy non trivial relations. Thus in the simplest case where A is
commutative we shall have,
                                       
(3)                        [f, ds−1 ], g = 0      ∀ f, g ∈ A .

The only other relation between ds and A is of degree n in ds−1 = D and expresses
the homological nature of the volume form (see axiom 4 below). When A is
commutative it has a spectrum, namely the space of algebra preserving maps from
A to the complex numbers,

(4)   χ : A → C ; χ(a + b) = χ(a) + χ(b) , χ(ab) = χ(a) χ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A ,
                        χ(λa) = λ χ(a) ∀ λ ∈ C , ∀ a ∈ A .

For instance, when A is the algebra of functions on a space M the space of such
maps, called characters of A identifies with M . To each point x ∈ M corresponds
the character χx ,

(5)                         χx (f ) = f (x)      ∀f ∈ A.

While relations such as (3) between the algebra A and the length element ds hold at
the universal level, a specific geometry will be specified as a unitary representation
of the algebra generated by A and ds. In general we shall deal with complex valued
functions f so that A will be endowed with an involution,

(6)                                    f → f∗

which is just complex conjugation of functions in the usual case,

(7)                         f ∗ (x) = f (x)      ∀x ∈ M .

                                          2
The length element ds will be selfadjoint,

(8)                                   ds∗ = ds

so that (ds)2 will be automatically positive.
The unitarity of the representation just means that the operator π(a∗ ) correspon-
ding to a∗ is the adjoint of the operator π(a),

(9)                      π(a∗ ) = π(a)∗       ∀ a ∈ (A, ds) .

Given a unitary representation π of (A, ds) we measure the distance between two
points x, y of our space by,
                          
(10)         d(x, y) = Sup |f (x) − f (y)| ; f ∈ A , k[f, ds−1 ]k ≤ 1

where we dropped the letter π but where the representation π has been used in a
crucial way to define the norm of [f, ds−1 ].
Before we proceed let us first explain what representation of (A, ds) corresponds
to an ordinary Riemannian geometry, and check that (10) gives us back exactly
the Riemannian geodesic distance of formula (2). The algebra A is the algebra of
smooth complex valued functions on M , A = C ∞ (M ) and we choose to represent
ds as the propagator for fermions which physicists write in a suggestive ways as
×—×. This means that we represent A in the Hilbert space L2 (M, S) of square
integrable sections of the spinor bundle on M by the following formula,

(11)      (f ξ)(x) = f (x) ξ(x)    ∀ f ∈ A = C ∞ (M ) , ∀ ξ ∈ H = L2 (M, S)

and we represent ds by the formula,

                                           1
(12)                       ds = D−1 , D = √    γ µ ∇µ
                                            −1

where D is the Dirac operator. We ignore the ambiguity of (12) on the kernel of
D.
One checks immediately that the commutator [D, f ], for f ∈ A = C ∞ (M ) is
the Clifford multiplication by the gradient ∇f so that its operator norm, in H =
L2 (M, S), is given by

(13)                          k[D, f ]k = Sup k∇f k .
                                          x∈M


                                          3
It then follows by integration along the path from x to y that |f (x) − f (y)| ≤
length of path, provided (13) is bounded by 1. Thus the equality between (10)
and (2).
Note that while ds has the dimension of a length, (ds)−1 which is represented by
D has the dimension of a mass. The formula (10) is dual to formula (2). In the
usual Riemannian case it gives the same answer but being dual it does not use
arcs connecting x with y but rather functions from M to C. As we shall see this
will allow to treat spaces with a finite number of points on the same footing as the
continuum. Another virtue of formula (10) is that it will continue to make sense
when the algebra A is no longer commutative.
In this paper we shall write down the axioms of geometry as the presentation of
the algebraic relations between A and ds and the representation of those relations
in Hilbert space.
In order to compare different geometries, i.e. different representations of the alge-
bra (A, ds) generated by A and ds, we shall use the following action functional,
                                        
                                         ds
(14)                             Trace ϕ
                                         ℓp

where ℓp is the Planck length and ϕ is a suitable cutoff function which will cut off
all eigenvalues of ds larger than ℓp .
We shall show in [CC] that for a suitable choice of the algebra A, the above
action will give Einstein gravity coupled with the Lagrangian of the standard
U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) model of Glashow Weinberg Salam. The algebra will not
be C ∞ (M ) with M a (compact) 4-manifold but a non commutative refinement
of it which has to do with the quantum group refinement of the Spin covering of
SO(4),

(15)                    1 → Z/2 → Spin(4) → SO(4) → 1 .

Amazingly, in this description the group of gauge transformations of the matter
fields arises spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the generalized diffeomorphism
group Aut(A).
It is the non commutativity of the algebra A which gives for free the group of
gauge transformations of matter fields as a (normal) subgroup of the group of dif-
feomorphisms. Indeed, when A = C ∞ (M ) is the commutative algebra of smooth

                                         4
functions on M one easily checks that the following defines a one to one corre-
spondence between diffeomorphisms ϕ of M and the automorphisms α ∈ Aut(A)
of the algebra A (preserving the ∗),

(16)           α(f ) (x) = f (ϕ−1 (x))       ∀ x ∈ M , f ∈ C ∞ (M ) .

In the non commutative case an algebra always has automorphisms, the inner
automorphisms given by

(17)                       αu (f ) = u f u∗      ∀f ∈ A

for any element of the unitary group U of A,

(18)                    U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u∗ u = 1} .

The subgroup Int(A) ⊂ Aut(A) of inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup
and it will provide us with our group of internal gauge transformations. It is a
happy coincidence that the two terminologies : inner automorphisms and internal
symmetries actually match. Both groups will have to be lifted to the spinors
but we shall see that later. We shall see that the action of inner automorphisms
on the metric gives rise to internal fluctuations of the latter which replace D by
D + A + J A J −1 (see below) and give exactly the gauge bosons of the standard
model, with its symmetry breaking Higgs sector, when we apply it to the above
finite geometry. We had realized in [Co2] that the fermions were naturally in the
adjoint representation of the unitary group U in the case of the standard model,
i.e. that the action of U on H was,

                            ξ → u J u J −1 ξ = u ξ u∗ .

But we had not understood the significance of the inner automorphisms as in-
ternal diffeomorphisms of the non commutative space. What the present paper
shows is that one should consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the
diffeomorphism group of the non commutative geometry and the gauge bosons as
the internal fluctuations of the metric. We should thus expect that the action
functional should be of purely gravitational nature. The above spectral action
when restricted to these special metrics will give the interaction Lagrangian of
the bosons. The interaction with Fermions, which has the right hypercharge as-
signement is obtained directly from hψ, Dψi (with D + A + J A J −1 instead of D),

                                         5
and is thus also of spectral nature being invariant under the full unitary group of
operators in Hilbert space. Thus the only distinction that remains between matter
and gravity is the distinction Int A 6= Aut A which vanishes for a number of highly
non commutative algebras.

Quantized calculus.
In order to ease the presentation of our axioms let us recall the first few lines of the
dictionary of the quantized calculus which makes use of the formalism of quantum
mechanics to formulate a new theory of infinitesimals. The first two lines of this
dictionary are just the traditional way of interpreting the observables in quantum
mechanics,
                Classical                          Quantum

            Complex variable               Operator in Hilbert space
               Real variable              Selfadjoint operator, T = T ∗
          Infinitesimal variable               Compact operator
         Infinitesimal of order α     R         µn (T ) = 0(n−α )
                  Integral            − T = log divergence of the trace of T
We recall briefly that an operator T in Hilbert space is compact iff for any ε > 0
one has kT k < ε except on a finite dimensional subspace of H. More precisely

(19)           ∀ ε there exists a finite dimensional subspace E of H
            such that kT /E ⊥ k < ε     where E ⊥ is the orthogonal of E .

The size of a compact operator T is measured by the decreasing sequence µn of
                     √
eigenvalues of |T | = T ∗ T . The order of such an “infinitesimal” is measured by
the rate at which these characteristic values µn (T ) converge to 0 when n → ∞.
One can show that all the intuitive rules of calculus are valid, e.g. the order of
T1 +T2 or of T1 T2 are as they should be (≤ α1 ∨α2 and α1 α2 ). Moreover the trace
(i.e. the sum of the eigenvalues) is logarithmically divergent for infinitesimals of
                              
order 1, since µn (T ) = 0 n1 . It is a quite remarkable fact that the coefficient
of the logarithmic divergency does yield an additive trace which in essence eva-
                                                                         R
luates the “classical part” of such infinitesimals. This trace, denoted − vanishes
on infinitesimals of order α > 1.
The only rule of the naive calculus of infinitesimals which is not fulfilled is com-
mutativity but this lack of commutativity is crucial to allow the coexistence of
variables with continuous range with infinitesimals which have discrete spectrum.

                                           6
We refer to [Co] for more details on this calculus and its applications.

Axioms for commutative geometry.
Let us now proceed and write down the axioms for commutative geometry. The
small modifications required for the non commutative case will only be handled
later.
Thus H is a Hilbert space, A an involutive algebra represented in H and D = ds−1
is a selfadjoint operator in H.
We are given an integer n which controls the dimension of our space by the con-
dition,
1) ds = D−1 is an infinitesimal of order n1 .
The universal commutation relation (3) is represented by
2) [[D, f ], g] = 0   ∀ f, g ∈ A.
We assume that the simple commutation with |D|, δ(T ) = [|D|, T ] will only yield
bounded operators when we start with any f ∈ A. More precisely we assume that:
3) (Smoothness) For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ m , for
any integer m.
This axiom 3 is the algebraic formulation of smoothness of the coordinates.
The next axiom is depending upon the parity of n, thus let us state it first when
n is even. It yields the γ5 matrix which is abstracted here as a Z/2 grading of the
Hilbert space H :
4) (Orientability) (n even) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn (A, A) such that
π(c) = γ satisfies
                          γ = γ ∗ , γ 2 = 1 , γD = −Dγ .

In the odd case (n odd) one just asks that 1 = π(c) for some n-dimensional
Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn (A, A).
We need to explain briefly what is a Hochschild cycle. Conceptually it is the
algebraic formulation of a differential form, so that axiom 4 is really providing us
with the volume form. Concretely an n-dimensional Hochschild cycle is a finite
sum of elements of A ⊗ A ⊗ . . . ⊗ A (with n + 1 times A),

                                 X
                            c=          a0j ⊗ a1j ⊗ a2j . . . ⊗ anj
                                    j


                                               7
such that the contraction bc = 0 where by definition b is linear and satisfies

        b(a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an ) = a0 a1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an − a0 ⊗ a1 a2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an
    + . . . + (−1)k a0 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ak ak+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an + . . . + (−1)n an a0 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an−1 .

When A is commutative it is easy to construct a Hochschild cycle, it suffices to
take any aj and consider
                      X
                  c=     ε(σ) a0 ⊗ aσ(1) ⊗ aσ(2) ⊗ . . . ⊗ aσ(n)

where the sum runs over all the permutations σ of {1, . . . , n}.
This special construction corresponds to the familiar differential form a0 da1 ∧da2 ∧
. . . ∧ dan but does not require the previous knowledge of the tangent bundle.
Finally π(c) is the representation of c on H induced by

                      π(a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an ) = a0 [D, a1 ] . . . [D, an ] .

To understand the meaning of axiom 4 let us take its simplest instance, with n = 1
and A = C ∞ (S 1 ) generated by a single unitary element U ∈ A, U U ∗ = U ∗ U = 1.
Let c = U −1 ⊗U one checks that bc = U −1 U −U U −1 = 0 so that c is a Hochschild
cycle, c ∈ Z 1 (A, A). Then the condition π(c) = 1 reads:

                                          [D, U ] = U .

The reader will check at this point that this relation alone completely describes
the geometry of the circle, by computing explicitly the distance between points
using formula (10). One finds the usual metric on the circle with length 2π.
The next axiom will be the axiom of finiteness,
5) (Finiteness and absolute continuity.) Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ =
∩ Domain Dm is finite and projective. Moreover the following equality defines a
m
hermitian structure ( , ) on this module,

                   ha ξ, ηi = f a(ξ, η) dsn         ∀ a ∈ A , ∀ ξ, η ∈ H∞ .

We recall from [Co] that a hermitian structure on a finite projective A-module is
given by an A-valued inner product. The prototype of such a module with inner
product is the following, one lets e ∈ Proj Mq (A) be a selfadjoint idempotent,

                                        e = e∗ , e2 = e

                                                8
and one lets E be the left module An e = {(ξj )j=1,...,n ; ξj ∈ A , ξj ejk = ξk } where
the action of A is given by left multiplication,

                          (a ξ)j = a ξj        ∀ j = 1, . . . , n .

The A-valued inner product is then given by:

                                   (ξ, η) = Σ ξi ηi∗ .

It follows from axiom 4) and from a general theorem ([Co]) that the operators a dsn ,
                                                        R
a ∈ A are measurable (cf. [Co]) so that the coefficient − a dsn of the logarithmic
divergence of their trace is unambiguously defined.
It follows from axiom 5) that the algebra A is uniquely determined inside its weak
closure A′′ (which is also the bicommutant of A in H) by the equality

                        A = {T ∈ A′′ ; T ∈ ∩ Dom δ m } .
                                                m>0


This shows that the whole geometric data (A, H, D) is in fact uniquely determined
by the triple (A′′ , H, D) where A′′ is a commutative von Neumann algebra.
This also shows that A is a pre C ∗ algebra, i.e. that it is stable under the C ∞
functional calculus in the C ∗ algebra norm closure of A, A = A. Since we assumed
that A was commutative, so is A and by Gelfand’s theorem A = C(X) is the
algebra of continuous complex valued functions on X = Spectrum (A). We note
finally that characters χ of A extend automatically to A by continuity so that

                            Spectrum A = Spectrum A .

We let Ki (A), i = 0, 1 be the K-groups of A (or equivalently of A or of X). Thus
K0 (A) classifies finite projective modules over A (or equivalently vector bundles
over X). Similarly K1 (A) is the group of connected components of GL∞ (A), i.e.
K1 (A) = π0 GL∞ (A), while by the Bott periodicity theorem one has,

                             πn (GL∞ (A)) ∼
                                          = Kn+1 (A)

where n + 1 only matters modulo 2.
One easily defines the index pairing of the operator D with Kn (A) where again
n only matters modulo 2. In the even case one uses γ to decompose D as D =
D+ + D− where D+ = (1 − p) Dp, p = 1+γ   2 . Then for any selfadjoint idempotent

                                           9
e ∈ A the operator e D+ e is a Fredholm operator from the subspace e p H of H to
the subspace e(1 − p)H. This extends immediately to projections e ∈ Mq (A) for
some integer q, and gives an additive map from K0 (A) to Z denoted hInd D, ei. A
similar discussion applies in the odd case ([]).
Since A is commutative we have the diagonal map,

                          m
                  A ⊗ A −→ A , m(x ⊗ y) = xy           ∀ x, y ∈ A

which yields a corresponding map m∗ : K∗ (A) × K∗ (A) → K∗ (A). Composing
this map with Ind D we obtain the intersection form,

                              K∗ (A) × K∗ (A) → Z ,

                         (e, f ) → hInd D , m∗ (e ⊗ f )i .

It clearly only depends upon the stable homotopy class of the representation π and
thus gives a very rough information on π. We shall assume, (Poincaré duality)

6) The intersection form K∗ (A) × K∗ (A) → Z is invertible.

If one wants to take in account the possible presence of torsion in the K-groups
one should formulate Poincaré duality as the isomorphism,

                                        ∩µ
                               K∗ (A) −→ K ∗ (A)

given by the Kasparov intersection product with the class µ of the Fredholm
module (H, D, γ) over A ⊗ A. We refer to [Co] [C] for the detailed formulation,
but 6) will suffice for theorem 1 below.
Thanks to the work of D. Sullivan [S] one knows that the above Poincaré duality
isomorphism in K theory is (in the simply connected case and ignoring 2-torsion)
a characterization of the homotopy type of spaces which possess a structure of
smooth manifold. This requires the use of real K theory instead of the above
complex K theory and our last axiom will be precisely the existence of such a real
structure on our cycle.

7) Reality. There exists an antilinear isometry J : H → H such that J a J −1 =
a∗    ∀ a ∈ A and J 2 = ε, J D = ε′ D J and J γ = ε′′ γ J where ε, ε′ , ε′′ ∈
{−1, +1} are given by the following table from the value of n modulo 8,

                                        10

We can now state our first result,

Theorem. Let A = C ∞ (M ) where M is a smooth compact manifold of dimension
n. a) Let π be a unitary representation of (A, ds) satisfying the above seven ax-
ioms, then there exists a unique Riemannian metric g on M such that the geodesic
distance between any two points x, y ∈ M is given by

                d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} .

b) The metric g = g(π) only depends upon the unitary equivalence class of π and
the fibers of the map : π → g(π) from unitary equivalence classes to metrics form
a finite collection of affine space Aσ parametrized by the Spin structures σ on M .
                            R
c) The action functional − dsn−2 is a positive quadratic form on each Aσ with a
unique minimum πσ .
d) πσ is the representation of (A, ds) in L2 (M, Sσ ) given by multiplication opera-
tors and the Dirac operator of the Levi Civita Spin connection.
                R
e) The value of − dsn−2 on πσ is given by the Einstein Hilbert action,
           Z                                                      n        −1
                    √
     −cn        R       g dn x ,   cn = (n − 2)/12 × (4π)−n/2 Γ        +1         2[n/2] .
                                                                   2


Let us make a few remarks about this theorem.
 1) Note first that none of the axioms uses the fact that A is the algebra of smooth
    functions on a manifold. In fact one should deduce from the axioms that the
    spectrum X of A is a smooth manifold and that the map X → RN , given by
    the finite collection aij of elements of A involved in the Hochschild cycle c of
    axiom 4, is actually a smooth embedding of X as a submanifold of RN . To
    prove this one should use [Co], proposition 15, p.312.

                                              11
 2) The two axioms 2 and 3 should be considered as the presentation of the
    algebra (A, ds). Thus this presentation involves an explicit Hochschild n-
    cycle c ∈ Zn (A, A) and for n odd gives the relation,

                              Σ aj0 [D, aj1 ] . . . [D, ajn ] = 1 .

    In the even case the relations are D γ = −γ D and γ 2 = 1, γ = γ ∗ , with

                              γ = Σ aj0 [D, aj1 ] . . . [D, aju ] .

    It is thus natural to fix c as part of the data. The differential form on M =
    Spectrum A associated to the Hochschild n-cycle c is equal to the volume form
    of the metric g. Thus fixing c determines the volume form of the metric.
 3) The sign in front of the Einstein Hilbert action given in (a) is the correct
    one for the Euclidean formulation of gravity and for instance in the n = 4
    dimensional case the Einstein Hilbert action becomes the area
                                             R 2
                                         ℓ−2
                                          p − ds


    of our space, in units of Planck length ℓp . Thus the only negative sign in the
                         R
    second derivative of − ds2 around flat space comes from the Weyl factor which
    is determined by the choice of c. We refer to [K] and [KW] for the detailed
    calculation.
 4) When M is a Spin manifold the map π → g(π) is surjective and if we fix c it
    surjects to the metrics g with fixed volume form. (This amounts to checking
    that all axioms are fulfilled.)
 5) If we drop axiom 7 there is a completely similar result as theorem 1 where
    Spin is replaced by Spinc (cf. [ML]) and where uniqueness is lost in c) and
    the minimum of the action f dsn−2 is reached on a linear subspace of Aσ with
    σ a fixed Spinc structure. The elements of this subspace correspond exactly
    to the U (1) gauge potentials involved in the Spinc Dirac operator and d) e)
    continue to hold.
 6) A commutative geometry (A, H, D) is connected iff the only operators com-
    muting with A and D are the scalars, i.e. iff the representation π of (A, ds)
    in H is irreducible.

The axioms for non commutative geometry.

                                           12
     We are now ready to proceed to the non commutative case, i.e. where we no
longer assume that the algebra A is commutative. Among the axioms we wrote 1)
3) 5) will remain unchanged while the others will be slightly modified. One of the
most significant results of the theory of operator algebras is Tomita’s theorem [Ta]
which asserts that for any weakly closed ∗ algebra of operators M in Hilbert space
H which admits a cyclic and separating vector, there exists a canonical antilinear
isometric involution J from H to H such that

                                   J M J −1 = M ′

where M ′ = {T ; T a = a T ∀ a ∈ M } is the commutant of M . It follows then
that M is antiisomorphic to its commutant, the antiisomorphism being given by
the C-linear map,
                           a ∈ M → J a∗ J −1 ∈ M ′ .

Now axiom 7 already involves an antilinear isometry J in H, which in the usual
geometric case is the charge conjugation. Since we assumed that A was commu-
tative the equality J a∗ J −1 = a of axiom 7 is compatible with Tomita’s antiiso-
morphism. In general we shall replace the requirement J a∗ J −1 = a ∀ a ∈ A of
axiom 7 by the following,

7′ ) One has [a, b0 ] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A where b0 = J b∗ J −1 (and [a, b0 ] is the commu-
tator ab0 − b0 a).
Otherwise we leave 7) unchanged. This immediately turns the Hilbert space H
into a module over the algebra A ⊗ A0 which is the tensor product of A by its
opposite algebra A0 . One lets,

                      (a ⊗ b0 ) ξ = a J b∗ J −1 ξ    ∀ a, b ∈ A .

(One can use equivalently the terminology of bimodules or correspondences (cf.
[Co]).)
Thus axiom (7′ ) now gives a KR-homology class for the algebra A ⊗ A0 endowed
with the antilinear automorphism,

                        τ (x ⊗ y 0 ) = y ∗ ⊗ x∗0    ∀ x, y ∈ A

and we do not need the diagonal map m : A ⊗ A → A (which is an algebra
homomorphism only in the commutative case) to formulate Poincaré duality,

                                           13
(6′ ) The cup product by µ ∈ KRn (A ⊗ A0 ) is an isomorphism
                                         ∩µ
                                 K∗ (A) −→ K ∗ (A) .

We also note that the intersection form on K∗ (A) continues to be well defined.
Given e, f ∈ K∗ (A) one considers e⊗f 0 as an element of K∗ (A⊗A0 ) and evaluates

                            he, f i = hIndex D , e ⊗ f 0 i .

From the table of commutation of axiom 7 one gets for instance that this inter-
section form is symplectic for n = 2 or 6 and quadratic for n = 0 or 4 modulo 8
as in the usual case.
We shall modify axiom 2 in the following way,

(2′ )                      [[D, a], b0] = 0     ∀ a, b ∈ A .

Note that by (7′ ) a and b0 commute so that the formulation of (2′ ) is symmetric,
i.e. it is equivalent to
                           [[D, b0 ], a] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A .

Finally we shall slightly modify (4). Of course Hochschild homology continues to
make sense in the non commutative case.

(4′ ) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn (A, A ⊗ A0 ) such that γ = π(c) satisfies
γ = γ ∗ , γ 2 = 1, γ a = a γ ∀ a ∈ A, γ D = −D γ. (In the odd case we simply
require π(c) = 1.)
We view A ⊗ A0 as a bimodule over A by restricting to the subalgebra A ⊗ 1 ⊂
A ⊗ A0 the natural structure of A ⊗ A0 bimodules on A ⊗ A0 . This gives

                    a(b ⊗ c0 ) d = a b d ⊗ c0     ∀ a, b, c, d ∈ A .

Note that the Hochschild homology makes sense with coefficients in any bimodule.
Since we have a representation of A ⊗ A0 in H, π(c) continues to make sense.
The axioms (3) and (5) are unchanged in the non commutative case, and the proof
of the measurability of the operators a dsn for any a ∈ A continues to hold in that
generality.
Thus a non commutative geometry of dimension n is given by a triple (A, H, D)
with real structure J satisfying (1) (2′ ) (3) (4′ ) (5) (6′ ) (7′ ).

                                          14
Examples and internal diffeomorphisms.
Let us give some simple examples. Let us first assume that A is the finite dimen-
sional commutative algebra A = CN . Even though A is commutative it admits
non trivial geometries and these are classified, up to homotopy of the operator D,
by integral quadratic forms q = (qij )i,j∈1,...,N which are invertible over Z. The
geometry associated to a quadratic form q is defined as follows. One lets H =
⊕ Hij where Hij = Cnij , nij = |qij |. The left action of A in H is given, with
i,j
obvious notations by

                         (a ξ)ij = ai ξij      ∀a ∈ A , ξ ∈ H.

The Z/2 grading γ is given by

                          (γ ξ)ij = γij ξij        γij = Sign qij

and the isometric antilinear involution J is given by,

                                     (J ξ)ij = ξ ji .

(It makes sense since qij = qji .)
One has K0 (A) = Zn and the intersection pairing is given by the quadratic form
q.
A choice of D is determined by a function m on the edges of the graph Γ defined
as follows. The vertices of Γ are the (i, j) with qij 6= 0, the edges of Γ are the (i, j),
(k, ℓ) for which γij γkℓ = −1 and i = k or j = ℓ. The function m on Γ(1) has to
satisfy mij,kℓ = mkℓ,ij and mij,kℓ = mji,ℓk . One can find D so that the obtained
geometry is connected iff the above graph is connected.
     As a next simple example let A = C ∞ (M, Mk (C)) be the algebra of k × k
matrix valued functions on a smooth compact Spin manifold M . Let g be a
Riemannian metric on M and H = L2 (M, S ⊗ Mk (C)) be the Hilbert space of L2
sections of the tensor product S ⊗ Mk (C) of the Spinor bundle S by Mk (C). Then
A acts on H by left multiplication,

                          (a ξ)(x) = a(x) ξ(x)          ∀x ∈ M .

The real structure J is given by

                                       J =C⊗∗

                                              15
where C is the charge conjugation on spinors and ∗ is the adjoint operation T → T ∗
on matrices. This operation transforms the left multiplication operators ξ → a ξ
on matrices into right multiplication operators ξ → ξ a∗ so that one checks axiom
(7′ ),
                     [a, b0 ] = 0   ∀ a, b ∈ A , b0 = J b∗ J −1 .

As a first choice of D one can take D = ∂/M ⊗ 1, the tensor product of the Dirac
operator ∂/M on M by the identity on Mk (C). One can then easily check that
one obtains a non commutative geometry in this way. This example is relevant
to illustrate two facts which hold in general in the non commutative case. The
first is that the group Aut(A) of ∗ automorphisms of the algebra A, which plays
in general the role of the group Diff(M ) of diffeomorphisms of the manifold M
and acts on the space of representations π by composition, has a natural normal
subgroup
                                 Int M ⊂ Aut M

where Int M is the group of inner automorphisms, i.e. automorphisms of the form,

                           αu (x) = u x u∗    ∀x ∈ A,

where u is an arbitrary element of the unitary group

                         U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u∗ u = 1} .

Moreover the action of this group of internal diffeomorphisms on our geometries
can be expressed in a simple manner. Indeed the replacement of the representation
π by π ◦ α−1
          u is equivalent to the replacement of the operator D by

                              e = D + A + J A J −1
                              D

where A = u[D, u∗ ].
The desired unitary equivalence is given by the operator,

                                 U = u J u J −1 .

                           e and that U α−1 (x) U ∗ = x for any x ∈ A.)
(One checks that U D U ∗ = D             u

The above perturbation of the metric is a special case of internal perturbation
given by,
                           De = D + A + J A J −1

                                        16
where A = A∗ is now an arbitrary operator of the form

                           A = Σ ai [D, bi ]       ai , bi ∈ A .

In the commutative case such perturbations of the metric all vanish because A =
A∗ implies A + J A J −1 = 0. But in the non commutative case they do not. Thus
in our example with k > 1 one gets that,

                               Int M = C ∞ (M, SU (k))

is the group of local gauge transformations (internal symmetries) for an SU (k)
gauge theory on M . The internal perturbations of the metric are parametrized by
SU (k) gauge potentials, i.e. by the non tracial part of A = Σ ai [D, bi ], ai , bi ∈ A.
One can compute the effect of such internal perturbations to the distance between
two pure states ϕ, ψ on A. We take x, y ∈ M and let ϕ and ψ correspond to two
unit vectors (rays) in Ck by the equality

                ϕ(a) = ha(x) ξ, ξi , ψ(a) = ha(y) η, ηi            ∀a ∈ A.

                                    e is defined as usual by
The distance d(ϕ, ψ) for the metric D

                                                        e a]k ≤ 1} .
               d(ϕ, ψ) = Sup {|ϕ(a) − ψ(a)| ; a ∈ A , k[D,

This distance depends heavily on the gauge connection A. The latter defines an
horizontal distribution H on the fibre bundle P over M whose fiber over each
x ∈ M is the pure state space Pk−1 (C) of Mk (C). The metric d turns out to be
equal to the Carnot metric ([G]) on P defined by the horizontal distribution H
and the Euclidean structure on H given by the Riemannian metric of M ,
                               Z 1
               d(ϕ, ψ) = Inf         kπ∗ (γ̇(t))k dt , γ(0) = ϕ , γ(1) = ψ
                                0

where π : P → M is the projection and γ varies through all horizontal paths
(γ̇(t) ∈ H ∀ t) which join ϕ to ψ. In particular the finiteness of d(ϕ, ψ) for x = y
is governed by the holonomy of the connection at the point x. The flat situation
A = 0 corresponds to the product geometry of M by the finite geometry where the
algebra is MN (C) and D = 0. For the latter since D = 0 the distance between any
two ϕ 6= ψ is +∞. Thus for the product one gets that the connected components
of the metric topology are the flat sections of the bundle P . Alternatively, if the
holonomy at x is SU (k), the metric on the fiber Px is finite.

                                             17
     Our next example will be highly non commutative. It is a special case of a
general construction that works for any isometry of a Riemannian Spin manifold,
but we shall work it out in the very specific case where this isometry is the irrational
rotation Rθ of the circle S 1 . This will have the advantage of definitness but the
whole discussion is general. The algebra is the irrational rotation smooth algebra,

                    Aθ = {Σ anm U n V m ; a = (an,m ) ∈ S(Z2 )}

where S(Z2 ), the Schwartz space of Z2 , is the space of sequences of rapid decay
(i.e. (1 + |n| + |m|)k an,m is bounded for any k ≥ 0). The ∗ algebra structure is
governed by the presentation,

            U ∗ = U −1 , V ∗ = V −1 , V U = λ U V with λ = exp(2πiθ)

with θ ∈ ]0, 1].
In order to specify the metric structure of our non commutative geometry we shall
need, as for usual elliptic curves, a complex number τ , ℑτ > 0. We can then
describe the geometry as follows: the Hilbert space H is given by the sum of
2-copies of L2 (Aθ , τ0 ) where τ0 is the canonical normalized trace,

                              τ0 (a) = a00        ∀ a ∈ Aθ .

The Hilbert space L2 (Aθ , τ0 ) is just the completion of Aθ for the inner product
ha, bi = τ0 (b∗ a) ∀ a, b ∈ Aθ .
The representation of Aθ in H is given by left multiplication, i.e. as 2 copies of
the left regular representation,
                                  
                        λ(a)     0
                 a→                  , λ(a) b = a b ∀ a, b ∈ Aθ .
                         0    λ(a)

The operator D depends explicitly on the choice of τ and is
                                                    
                                    0      δ1 + τ δ2
                        D=
                               −δ1 − τ δ2      0

where the δj are the following derivations of Aθ ,

           δ1 (U ) = 2πi U , δ1 (V ) = 0 ; δ2 (U ) = 0 , δ2 (V ) = 2πi V .
                                       
                                 1 0

To specify our geometry it remains to give the antilinear isometry. We let J =

   0   J0
             where J0 is Tomita’s involution ([Ta]),
  −J0 0
                           J0 a = a∗     ∀ a ∈ L2 (Aθ , τ0 ) .
Note that J0 λ(a∗ ) J0−1 = ρ(a) is the right multiplication by a ∈ Aθ so that our
axiom (7′ ) is easy to check. The dimension n is equal to 2 so that J D = D J,
J 2 = −1 and J γ = −γ J as expected.
The other axioms are easy to check but axiom (4′ ) is not so trivial because it
requires to exhibit a Hochschild 2-cycle, c ∈ Z2 (Aθ , Aθ ) such that π(c) = γ. It
turns out to be,
         c = (2iπ)−2 (τ − τ )−1 (V −1 U −1 ⊗ U ⊗ V − U −1 V −1 ⊗ V ⊗ U ) .
(Note that this is not the same as the antisymmetrization of V −1 U −1 ⊗ U ⊗ V
because of the phase factor in V −1 U −1 6= U −1 V −1 .) One checks that b c = 0 and
π(c) = γ.
                         R       R
Note also that the area, − ds2 = − D−2 of the non commutative torus depends on
τ in the same way as c, the reason is that it has homological significance,
                                  R 2
                                  − ds = hϕ, ci
where the cyclic cocycle ϕ is rigidly fixed by its integrality as the chern character
of our K-cycle.
It is also worthwile to check in some detail the Poincaré duality. The point is
that while at a superficial level our geometry T 2θ looks like an ordinary torus, this
impression quickly fades away if we realize that for θ ∈  / Q the algebra Aθ contains
many non trivial idempotents ([Ri] [Po]) and smooth real elements a = a∗ of Aθ
can have Cantor spectrum (thus from the point of view of a the space T 2θ looks as
totally disconnected). In fact at first it might seem that Poincaré duality might
fail since there is no element x ∈ K0 (Aθ ), x 6= 0 of virtual dimension 0, τ0 (x) = 0,
the characteristic property of the Bott element. Indeed, when θ ∈       / Q, the K0
            2
group is Z ([Pi-V]) and the trace τ0 (n e0 + m e1 ) = n + m θ never vanishes unless
n = m = 0. The above specifies uniquely the basis e0 = [1] and e1 , τ0 (e1 ) = θ of
K0 and we take the basis U, V for K1 . In this basis the intersection form of axiom
(6) is given by the symplectic matrix,
                                                  
                                   0 −1 0 0

                                          19
It follows that Poincaré duality is satisfied and that the Bott element β makes
sense, as an element of K0 (A0θ ⊗ Aθ ). It is given by

                     β = e00 ⊗ e1 − e01 ⊗ e0 + u0 ⊗ v − v 0 ⊗ u

where we denote by ⊗ the external cup product in K theory. One can check that
with µ the K-homology class on Aθ ⊗A0θ given by our K-cycle one has the Poincaré
duality equation ([CS])

                      µ ⊗A0θ β = idAθ           β ⊗Aθ µ = idA0θ .

Finally the unique trace on A0θ ⊗ Aθ is τ00 ⊗ τ0 and it does vanish on β, hτ00 ⊗
τ0 , βi = 0 which is the expected property of the Bott element.
In the general theory both β ∈ K∗ (A0θ ⊗ Aθ ) and µ ∈ K ∗ (Aθ ⊗ A0θ ) make sense
and satisfy the above equation. Moreover the local index theorem of [CM] allows to
                                                                       R
compute the pairing hµ, βi by a local formula, i.e. a formula invoking − of simple
algebraic expressions. This yields the Gauss Bonnet theorem in our context, due
to the equality,
                           hµ, βi = Rank K0 − Rank K1

(where the rank is the rank of the abelian group, i.e. dimQ (Kj ⊗ Q)).
                                                                     Using

                                                                     a b

                        σ(U ) = U a V b , σ(V ) = U c V d

it is not difficult to check that, up to an irrelevant scale factor, the non commu-
tative geometry T 2θ,τ only depends upon the value of τ in C+ /P SL(2, Z). The
new phenomenon which occurs in the non commutative case is the Morita equiva-
lence of geometries which will correspond here to the action of the modular group
P SL(2, Z) on the module θ rather than τ . To change θ in this way one uses a
finite projective right module E over the algebra A and then one replaces A by
the algebra B = EndA (E). To be more specific let us change θ in − 1θ as follows.
We take for E the following right A-module ([Co]). As a vector space E is the
Schwartz space S(R) of functions on R. The right action of Aθ on S is specified
by the rules,
                      (ξ U )(s) = ξ(s + θ)   ∀ ξ ∈ S(R) , ∀ s ∈ R

                  (ξ V )(s) = e2πis ξ(s)        ∀ ξ ∈ S(R) , ∀ s ∈ R .

                                           20
One checks directly that the algebra B = EndAθ (S) is isomorphic to A−1/θ with
generators given by the translation by 1 and the multiplication by the function
              
s → exp 2πis
           θ   . This Aθ - module S is naturally a hermitian module ([Co]) and
we can now apply the following general operation of Morita equivalence in non
commutative geometry.
Let (A, H, D) be a given geometry and B = EndA (E) a Morita equivalent algebra.
Then a non commutative geometry, (B, H,e D)
                                         e is uniquely specified by a hermitian
connection ([Co]) ∇ on E. Such a connection is a linear map,

                                   ∇ : E → E ⊗A Ω1D

where Ω1D is the A-bimodule,

                      Ω1D = {Σ ai [D, bi ] ; ai , bi ∈ A} ⊂ L(H)

and ∇ should satisfy the Leibnitz rule and the compatibility with the hermitian
structure,
1) ∇(ξ a) = (∇ ξ) a + ξ ⊗ [D, a]      ∀a ∈ A , ξ ∈ E
2) (ξ, ∇ η) − (∇ ξ, η) = d(ξ, η)     ∀ ξ, η ∈ E
where d a = [D, a] by definition.
             e and D
To construct H       e one proceeds as follows.
         e = E ⊗A H ⊗A E where E is the conjugate module, with elements ξ,
One lets H
ξ ∈ E and the module structure,

                         a ξ = (ξ a∗ )−     ∀ξ ∈ E , a ∈ A.

Then He has a natural Hilbert space structure (cf. [Co]) obtained using the her-
mitian structure of E.
The operator De is given by the formula,

              e ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = (∇ ξ) η ⊗ ζ + ξ ⊗ D η ⊗ ζ + ξ ⊗ η(∇ ζ)
              D(ξ

where we take advantage of the action of Ω1D in H in order to make sense of (∇ ξ) η
for instance (cf. [Co]). The above formula is compatible with tensor products over
A. Similarly the real structure Je is given by (with obvious notations),

                            Je (ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = ζ ⊗ J η ⊗ ξ .

                                          21
                                                                    e D)
One then checks that all our axioms are fulfilled by the triple (B, H, e and Je
where the action of B is given by

                          b (ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = (b ξ) ⊗ η ⊗ ζ .

In our specific example of the right module S on Aθ the Aθ bimodule Ω1D is easily
computed and (cf. [Co]) as a bimodule it is the sum of two copies of Aθ which we
write by identifying ω ∈ Ω1D with a 2 × 2 matrix of the form,
                                                
                                        0   λ(a)
                                 ω=
                                       λ(b)   0

and writing a = (δ1 + τ δ2 )(x), b = (−δ1 , −τ δ2 )(x) for any x ∈ A and ω = dx.
A connection ∇ is uniquely specified by the two covariant derivatives ∇j which
correspond to δj . Thus a specific choice of connection on S is given by

                                          2πi
                              (∇1 ξ)(s) =        s ξ(s)
                                            θ
                              (∇2 ξ)(s) = ξ ′ (s) .

We leave as an exercise to compute the corresponding value of the module τ ′ for
the Morita equivalent geometry on T 2−1/θ . The connection ∇ used in this example
has constant curvature (cf. [C-R]) but there is a lot of freedom in the choice of
the connection. Indeed the space of connections is naturally an affine space over
the vector space HomA (E, E ⊗A Ω1D ) (with the selfadjointness condition).
All this discussion applies in particular when E = A and yields a whole new class
of geometries, the internal perturbation which replace D by D +A +J A J −1 where
A is an arbitrary selfadjoint element of Ω1D .
These internal perturbations are trivial: A + J A J −1 = 0 when the geometry is
commutative (theorem 1). They are highly non trivial for T 2θ , θ ∈
                                                                  / Q.
When θ ∈ / Q the von Neumann algebra weak closure of Aθ in H is the hyperfinite
factor of type T 1 and the antilinear isometry J0 is Tomita’s involution. In the
general theory it is always true that the von Neumann algebra A′′ weak closure of
A in H is finite and hyperfinite. This follows from axiom 5, the general properties
of the Dixmier trace and the results of [Co]. In particular the von Neumann
algebras involved in our geometries are completely classified up to isomorphism
([Co]).

The non commutative geometry of the standard model.

                                         22
We shall now describe a simple finite geometry of dimension equal to 0, (AF , HF ,
DF ) (F for finite), whose product by ordinary Euclidean 4-dimensional geometry
(or more generally by a 4-dimensional Spin manifold) will give the standard model
(SM) in the following way:
 1) The Hilbert space H will describe the (one particle) Fermionic sector of the
    SM.
 2) The inner fluctuations of the metric D → D + A + J A J −1 give exactly the
    bosonic sector of SM with the correct quantum numbers and hypercharges for
    the coupling with the fermions: hDψ, ψi.
 3) The spectral action Trace (ϕ(D−1 )) + hDψ, ψi restricted to the inner fluctu-
    ations of the metric, gives the SM Lagrangian.
We postpone the proof of (3) and the analysis of its relation to gravity to our
collaboration with A.C. [CC].
In this paper we shall describe the geometry (AF , HF , DF ) and check (2) in some
detail.
We let HF be the Hilbert space with basis the list of elementary Fermions. Thus
each generation of Fermions contributes by a space of dimension 15 + 15 where
15 = 12 + 3. The 12 corresponds to the quarks and 12 = 4 × 3 where the 4 is given
by the table
                                    uR uL
                                    dR dL
of up and down particles of left or right chirality, while the 3 is given by the color
index. The 3 in 15 = 12 + 3 corresponds to the leptons and is given by the table
                                              νL
                                                 .
                                        eR    eL
The second 15 in 15 + 15 corresponds to antiparticles and is obtained by putting
an f instead of an f for any f in the above basis. This gives us the antilinear
isometry J = JF in HF , by

                       JF (Σ λi fi + Σ µj f j ) = Σ µj fj + Σ λi f i

for any λi , µj ∈ C.
We let AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3 (C) be the direct sum the real involutive algebras C of
complex numbers, H of quaternions, and M3 (C) of 3 × 3 matrices.h (Recall
                                                                      i that
                                                                  α β
quaternions q can be represented as 2 × 2 matrices of the form −β α where
α, β ∈ C.)

                                             23
Let us give the action of A in HF . We let, for a = (λ, q, m) ∈ A,

                      a uR = λ uR        a uL = α uL − β dL

                      a dR = λ d R       a dL = β uL + α dL .

(Independently of the color index), while for leptons the formula is the same but
there is no uR .
This fixes completely the action of A on particles. The action on antiparticles f
is given by: (for a = (λ, q, m) as above)

                            af = λf     if f is a lepton

                           af = mf      if f is a quark .

Here the 3 × 3 matrix is acting in the obvious way on the color index.

For the operator DF we take DF =                where Y is the Yukawa coupling

                   0      Md∗    0    0
For one generation Mu , Md and Me would just be scalars but for 3 generations
they are matrices which encode both the masses of the Fermions and their mixing
properties.
Let us now check our axioms for this 0-dimensional geometry (AF , HF , DF ). We
begin by checking 7′ ). One has JF2 = 1, JF DF = DF JF and it is clear that JF
commutes with the natural Z/2 grading given by chirality:

           γ(fR ) = fR , γ(fL ) = −fL        (f particle or antiparticle) .

But the important property is that [a, b0 ] = 0 for any a, b ∈ A (cf. (7′ )), where
b0 = J b∗ J −1 ∀ b ∈ A. To check it, it is enough to see what happens on one
generation of particles. For quarks the right action b0 of b ∈ A b = (λ, q, m)
is given by mt acting on the color index which obviously commutes with the left

                                        24
action of A. For leptons the right action is by the scalar λ which also commutes
with the left action of A.
We have thus checked (7′ ). Since n = 0 and HF is finite dimensional the axiom
(1) is obvious. To check (2′ ) we need to show that [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.
Once again it is enough to check it for one generation of particles, it is clear for
leptons and it is true for quarks exactly because the color is unbroken so that both
a and D exactly commute with the right action of A.
Being in finite dimension the axiom 3 is obvious.
To check (4′ ) one verifies that γ = ε J ε J where ε is the following element of A,
ε = (1, −1, 1). Thus one has c = ε ⊗ ε0 ∈ A ⊗ A0 .
Note that our algebra A is real so that (5) has to be stated for the complex algebra
generated by A in HF . It is then clear. Finally when we compute the intersection
form on K0 (A) = Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Z we find, with N the number of generators, the 3 × 3
matrix,                                             
                                         −1 1 −1
                            Q = 2N  1 0 1  .
                                         −1 1 0
The above matrix is invertible with inverse given by
                                                    
                                            1 1 −1
                        Q−1 = (2N )−1  1 1 0 
                                           −1 0 1

so that (6) only holds rationally.
We now consider a 4-dimensional smooth compact Riemannian manifold M with a
fixed spin structure and consider its product with the above finite geometry. One
can prove that our notion of geometry is stable by products. When one of the two
geometries is even (i.e. it possesses a Z/2 grading γ1 ), the product geometry is
given by the rules,

             A = A1 ⊗ A2 , H = H1 ⊗ H2 , D = D1 ⊗ 1 + γ1 ⊗ D2 .

To check axiom (4′ ) for instance one uses the shuffle product in Hochschild homo-
logy (cf. Loday).
For the product of the manifold M by the finite geometry F we thus have A =
C ∞ (M ) ⊗ AF = C ∞ (M, AF ), H = L2 (M, S) ⊗ HF = L2 (M, S ⊗ HF ) and D =
∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF where ∂/M is the Dirac operator on M .

                                        25
Let us check that the inner fluctuations of the metric give us the gauge bosons
of the standard model with their correct quantum numbers. We first have to
compute A = Σ ai [D, a′i ] ai , a′i ∈ A. Since D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF decomposes
as a sum of two terms, so does A and we first consider the discrete part A(0,1)
coming from commutators with γ5 ⊗ DF . Let x ∈ M and let ai (x) = (λi , qi , mi ),
a′i (x) = (λ′i , qi′ , m′i ), the computation of Σ ai [γ5 ⊗ DF , a′i ] at x gives γ5 tensored by

for the quark part, with ϕ1 = Σ λi (α′i − λ′i ), ϕ2 = Σ λi βi′

                                              ′                           ′
             ϕ′1 = Σ αi (λ′i − α′i ) + βi β i , ϕ′2 = Σ (−αi βi′ + βi (λi − α′i )) .

For the lepton part one gets the 3 × 3 matrix,
                                                                   

where ϕ1 , ϕ2 , ϕ′1 and ϕ′2 are as above.
                                                                              

Let q = ϕ1 + ϕ2 j, q =             ϕ′1 + ϕ′2 j
                                       where j is the quaternion            . The
                                                                    −1 0
selfadjointness condition A = A∗ is equivalent to q ′ = q ∗ and we see that the
discrete part A(0,1) is exactly given by a quaternion valued function, q(x) ∈ H on
M . This pair of complex fields is the Higgs doublet and one checks that it has
the right quantum numbers. The antiparticle sector does not contribute to A(0,1)
because the left action of AF on this sector exactly commutes with DF .
Let us now determine the other part A(1,0) of A, i.e.

                                   A(1,0) = Σ ai [(∂/M ⊗ 1), a′i ] .

With obvious notations, ai = (λi , qi , mi ), a′i = (λ′i , qi′ , m′i ) we obtain,
     A U (1) gauge field Λ = Σ λi d λ′i
     A SU (2) gauge field Q = Σ qi d qi′
     A U (3) gauge field V = Σ mi d m′i .

The computation of A+J A J −1 gives the following matrices on quarks and leptons,
where we omit the symbol of Clifford multiplication,

where the matrix for quarks is a 4 × 4 matrix of 3 × 3 matrices because V is a 3 × 3
matrix, (ignoring the flavor index). Since we are only interested in the fluctuation
of the metric we shall write the total 15 × 15 matrix as the sum of a traceless
matrix plus a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Since the latter does not
affect the metric we shall ignore it. This amounts to remove a U (1) by imposing
the condition that the full matrix is traceless, i.e. that 4 trace V − 4Λ = 0, i.e.
trace V = Λ. Thus we get V = V ′ + 13 Λ with trace V ′ = 0 so that V ′ is an SU (3)
gauge potential. The U (1) field Λ is the generator of hypercharge and we obtain
the following matrices for the inner fluctuation A + J A J −1 of the metric (vector
part),
           4      ′                                                       

Together with the above Higgs doublet which gives the scalar part of A + J A J −1
we thus obtain exactly the gauge bosons of the standard model coupled with the
correct hypercharges YL , YR . They are such that the electromagnetic charge Qem ,
is determined by 2 Qem = YR for right handed particles and 2 Qem = YL + 2 I3
where I3 is the 3rd generator of the weak isospin group SU (2). For Qem one gets
the same answer for the left and right components of each particle and 23 , − 31 for
u, d respectively and 0, −1 for ν and e respectively.
We showed in [C] that one obtains the full Lagrangian of the standard model
             R
from the sum − θ 2 ds4 + h(D + A + J A J −1 )ψ, ψi where θ is the curvature of the

                                        27
connection A. However this requires the definition of the curvature and is still
in the spirit of gauge theories. What the present paper shows is that one should
consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the diffeomorphism group of the
non commutative geometry, and the gauge bosons as the internal fluctuations of the
metric. It follows then that the action functional should be of purely gravitational
nature. We state the principle of spectral invariance, stronger than the invariance
under diffeomorphisms, which requires that the action functional only depends on
the spectral properties of D = ds−1 in H. This is verified by the action,

                           I = Trace (ϕ(ds/ℓp)) + hD ψ, ψi

for any nice function ϕ from R∗+ to R.
We shall show in [CC] that this action gives the SM Lagrangian coupled with grav-
ity. It would seem at first sight that the algebra A has disappeared from the scene
when one writes down the above action, the point is that it is still there because it
imposes the constraints [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A and Σ a0i [D, a1i ] . . . [D, a4i ] = γ
coming from axioms 2 and 4.
It is important at this point to note that the integrality, n ∈ N of the dimension
of a non commutative geometry appears to be essential to define the Hochschild
cycle c ∈ Zn and in turns the chirality γ. This is very similar to the obstruction
which appears when one tries to apply dimensional regularization to chiral gauge
theories.
The relations (axioms 2 and 4) which relate the algebra A with the infinitesimal
length element ds are very simple but it is clear that more involved relations of a
quartic type are necessary to cover the hypoelliptic situation encountered in [CM].
Also the algebra A = C ∞ (M ) ⊗ AF used in the description of the standard model
is only slightly non commutative. This commutativity should fade away when one
gets to energies Λ ∼ mp so that the inner automorphisms Int A exhaust more and
more automorphisms of A. It is tempting to follow the approximation scheme given
in [GKP] but the main difficulty is that the above non linear constraints between
the algebra A and the operator D do not have finite dimensional realizations since
the Hochschild homology H4 (A, A) vanishes for any finite dimensional algebra A.
As a final remark we look for an explanation of the remaining non commutativity of
the algebra A = C ∞ (M )⊗AF from the theory of quantum groups at roots of unity.
The simple fact is that the Spin covering of SO(4), i.e. Spin(4) is not the maximal
covering in the world of quantum groups. Indeed, Spin(4) = SU (2) × SU (2) and

                                            28
even the single group SU (2) admits, in the sense of non commutative geometry
(cf. [M]) non trivial extensions of finite order, (Frobenius at ∞)

                        1 → H → SU (2)q → SU (2) → 1

where q is any root of unity, q m = 1, of odd order. The simplest instance is when
                            
m = 3 so that q = exp 2πi 3 . The quantum group H has a finite dimensional Hopf
algebra which is closely related to the algebra AF . The Spin representation of H
defines, like any other representation of H, a bimodule over the Hopf algebra of
H. The structure of this bimodule turns out to be very similar to the structure of
the bimodule HF over AF that we described above. The details of the adaptation
of these ideas to Spin(4) = SU (2) × SU (2) still remain to be elucidated.
