Electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of emulating many exotic space-time
geometries, such as black holes, rotating cosmic strings, and the big bang
singularity. Here we present a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre warp
drive, and study its limitations due to available range of material parameters. It
appears that the material parameter range introduces strong limitations on the
achievable “warp speed”, so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials cannot be
used. On the other hand, newly developed “perfect” bi-anisotropic non-reciprocal
magnetoelectric metamaterials should be capable of emulating the physics of warp
drive gradually accelerating up to 1/4c.

PACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 42.25.Bs.

Metamaterial optics [1,2] greatly benefited from the field theoretical ideas developed to
describe physics in curvilinear space-times [3]. Unprecedented degree of control of the
local dielectric permittivity εik and magnetic permeability μik tensors in electromagnetic
metamaterials has enabled numerous recent attempts to engineer highly unusual “optical
spaces”, such as electromagnetic black holes [4-8], wormholes [9], and rotating cosmic
strings [10]. Phase transitions in metamaterials are also capable of emulating physical

2

processes which took place during and immediately after the big bang [11,12]. These
models can be very informative for phenomena where researchers have no direct
experience and therefore limited intuition.
Since its original introduction by Alcubierre [13], the warp drive spacetime has
become one of the most studied geometries in general relativity. In the simplest form it
can be described by the metric

ds 2 = c 2 dt 2 − (dx − v(r )dt ) − dy 2 − dz 2
2

(

where r = ( x − v0 t ) + y 2 + z 2
2

)

is the distance from the center of the “warp bubble”,

v0 is the warp drive velocity, and v=v0f(r). The function f(r) is a smooth function
satisfying f(0)=1 and f (r ) → 0 for r → ∞ . This metric describes an almost flat
spheroidal “warp bubble” which is moving with respect to asymptotically flat external
spacetime with an arbitrary speed v0. Such a metric bypasses the speed limitation due to
special relativity: while nothing can move with speeds greater than the speed of light
with respect to the flat background, spacetime itself has no restriction on the speed with
which it can be stretched. One example of fast stretching of the spacetime is given by
the inflation theories, which demonstrate that immediately after the big bang our
Universe expanded exponentially during an extremely short period of time.
Unfortunately, when the spacetime metric (1) is plugged into the Einstein’s
equations, it is apparent that exotic matter with negative energy density is required to
build the warp drive. In addition, it was demonstrated that the eternal superluminal warp
drive becomes unstable when quantum mechanical effects are introduced [14]. Another
line of research deals with a situation in which a warp drive would be created at a very
low velocity, and gradually accelerated to large speeds. Physics of such a process is also
quite interesting [15]. We should point out that the warp drive space-time cannot be

3

reduced to a simple combination of a white-hole and a black-hole event horizons. Such
a combination would be non-controversial and “easy” to realize. The difference between
the warp drive space-time and such a white-hole/black-hole combination is that the flat
space-time region inside the warp bubble is moving as a whole with respect to the flat
space-time outside the warp bubble (see metric in eq.(1)) . This non-trivial property of
the warp drive space-time has led to conclusion that it cannot be realized even at subluminal speeds. Very recently it was demonstrated that even low speed sub-luminal
warp drives generically require energy-conditions-violating matter [16]: the T00
component of the energy-momentum tensor (the energy density distribution) appears to
be negative even at sub-luminal speeds. Therefore, even subluminal warp drives appear
to be prohibited by the laws of physics.
In this paper we demonstrate that electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of
emulating the warp drive metric (1). Since energy conditions violations do not appear to
be a problem in this case, metamaterial realization of the warp drive is possible. Our
result is interesting because the body of evidence collected so far seemed to indicate that
the warp drives operating at any speed (even sub-luminal) were strictly prohibited by
the laws of Nature
Below we will find out what kind of metamaterial geometry is needed to
emulate a laboratory model of the warp drive, so that we can build more understanding
of the physics involved. It appears that the available range of material parameters
introduces strong limitations on the possible “warp speed”. Nevertheless, our results
demonstrate that physics of a gradually accelerating warp drive can be modeled based
on newly developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17]. Since even low

4

velocity physics of warp drives is quite interesting [15,16], such a lab model deserves
further study.
To avoid unnecessary mathematical complications, let us consider a 1+1
dimensional warp drive metric of the form
2
2
ds 2 = (c / n∞ ) dt 2 − (dx − v0 f ( ~
x )dt ) − dy 2 − dz 2

(2)

where ~
x = ( x − v0 t ) and n∞ is a scaling constant. In the rest frame of the warp bubble it
can be re-written as

(

)

2
~
2
ds 2 = (c / n∞ ) dt 2 − d~
x + v0 f ( ~
x )dt − dy 2 − dz 2

(3)

~
~
x → ±∞ . The resulting metric is
where f (0) = 0 , and f ( ~
x ) → 1 for ~

⎛ 1 v02 ~ 2 ~ ⎞ 2 2 ~ 2

ds = ⎜⎜ 2 − 2 f ( x ) ⎟⎟c dt − dx − 2v0 f ( ~
x )d~
x dt − dy 2 − dz 2
⎝ n∞ c
⎠

Following ref.[18], Maxwell equations in this gravitational field can be written in the
three-dimensional form as

r
rr
r E
D=

h

[ ]

r

rr
B=

(5)

where h=g00, and gα=-g0α/g00. These equations coincide with the macroscopic Maxwell
equations in a magneto-electric material [19]. In the equivalent material

ε = μ = h −1 / 2 =

1
1 v02 ~ 2 ~

f (x )

and the only non-zero component of the magneto-electric coupling vector is

v0 ~ ~

In the subluminal v0<<c limit eqs.(6) and (7) become

⎛ v02 n∞2 ~ 2 ~ ⎞
v ~
ε = μ ≈ n∞ ⎜⎜1 + 2 f ( x ) ⎟⎟ , g x ≈ n∞2 0 f ( ~x )

⎠

(8)

The magneto-electric coupling coefficients in thermodynamically stable materials are
limited by the inequality [20]:
g x2 ≤ (ε − 1)(μ − 1) ,

(9)

which means that a subluminal warp drive model based on the magnetoelectric effect
must satisfy inequality
v0 ~ ~
n −1
f (x ) ≤ ∞ 2
c
n∞

(10)

This inequality demonstrates that while “the true warp drive” in vacuum ( n∞ = 1 ) is
prohibited, n∞ > 1 values

in a material medium make a warp drive model

thermodynamically stable at least at subluminal speeds. This is an important result
because the body of evidence collected so far seems to indicate that the warp drives
operating at any speed are strictly prohibited by laws of Nature. Equation (10) also
provides an upper bound on the largest possible “warp speed”, which is achievable
within the described metamaterial model. This upper bound is reached at n∞ = 2 , and
equals to v0=1/4c. Therefore, at the very least, we can build a toy model of a warp drive
“operating” at v0~1/4c. Coordinate dependence of the metamaterial parameters in such a
−1
~
model is shown in Fig.1 assuming f ( ~
x ) = (1 + a 2 / ~
x2) .

However, in classical magnetoelectric materials, such as Cr2O3 and
multiferroics, actual values of magnetoelectric susceptibilities are two orders of
magnitude smaller than the limiting value described by eq. (9) [21], so that the warp
drive model is impossible to make with ordinary materials. On the other hand, recently

6

developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17], which can be built based on
such designs as split ring resonators, fishnet structures [22], etc. allow experimentalists
to reach the limiting values described by eq.(9), and make a lab model of the warp drive
possible. Following ref.[17], the effective susceptibilities of the split ring metamaterial
can be written in the RLC-circuit model as

nCd 2ω02
nCS 2ω 2ω02
ε = 1+ 2
, μ = 1+ 2 2
, and
ω0 − ω 2 − iωγ
c ω0 − ω 2 − iωγ

(12)

where n is the split ring density, d is the gap in the ring, S is the ring area, and C is the
gap capacitance. These expressions explicitly demonstrate that the split ring
metamaterial considered in ref. [17] satisfies the upper bound given by eq.(9), and
therefore can be used as one of the building blocks in the metamaterial warp drive
design. On the other hand, this particular split-ring design cannot be used without
modification, since this metamaterial is reciprocal.
An actual laboratory demonstration of a metamaterial warp drive space time
would require a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial, in which both spatial and
time reversal symmetries are broken. In addition, the metamaterial loss issue has to be
overcome. Since the issue of metamaterial loss compensation using gain media is well
studied (see for example recent experimental demonstration of loss compensation in a
negative index metamaterial [23]) let us concentrate on the experimental ways of
breaking spatial and time reversal symmetries. Breaking the mirror x ↔ -x symmetry is
most easily achieved by deformation of the metamaterial, which can be easily done in
either one of the most popular split ring [17] or fishnet [22] metamaterial designs. As far
as breaking the time-reversal t ↔ -t symmetry is concerned, there are two most natural

7

ways to break this symmetry in solids: application of external magnetic field [24,25], or
spin-orbit interaction in a nonsymmorfic lattice [26]. In addition, such chiral
superconductors as Sr2RuO4 [27] may be used in superconducting metamaterial designs
[28]. Application of external electric and magnetic fields is known to break both spatial
and time symmetries of such materials as methyl-cyclopentadienyl-Mn-tricarbonil
molecular liquids [24], thus creating an illusion of a moving (non-reciprocal bianisotropic) medium [25]. Experimental results of ref. [24] do indeed demonstrate this
behavior (however, the emulated “medium velocity” is very low, of the order of 50 nm/s
[25]). Since utilization of magnetized particles, such as ferrites is easily applicable in
the metamaterial design, all the ingredients necessary for experimental realization of the
Alcubierre metric have been demonstrated in the experiment. Moreover, we should
point out that very recently it was also asserted [29,30] that material parameters, which
are necessary to achieve a warp drive imitation in a nanostructured metamaterial are
indeed possible.
Let us come back to the split ring-based “perfect magnetoelectric metamaterial”
design implemented in [17], and demonstrate how the time-reversal symmetry may be
broken in this metamaterial. One of the possible metamaterial geometries is shown
schematically in Fig.2. An elementary unit of the split ring-based “perfect
magnetoelectric metamaterial” design of ref.[17] is supplemented with a magnetized
ferrite particle. The particle is magnetized and shifted along the x-direction with respect
to the center of the split ring. Thus, this geometry explicitly violates spatial and time
reversal symmetries, resulting in a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial. As
demonstrated in [31], near the ferromagnetic resonance frequency in such a
metamaterial

8

g~

ω mω 0
,
ω02 − ω 2

(13)

where ω0 is the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, and ωm=γM0. Thus, in the design
presented in Fig.2 gx is proportional to the particle magnetization M0 in a given location,
which explicitly demonstrate the non-reciprocal nature of this metamaterial design.
Time reversal t ↔ -t leads to change of sign of gx. We should also note that very
recently a somewhat related metamaterial design has been proposed in ref.[32] , which
emulates medium motion at an arbitrary speed. While demonstrating the proof of
principle, the designs presented in Fig.2 and ref.[32] may only be considered as a first
step. Such complicated metamaterial designs typically contain many unwanted terms in

ε, μ and g, which must be carefully eliminated by iteration, so that the ideal form of
eqs.(8) may be achieved.
Light rays propagation inside the metamaterial model of the warp drive
“operating” at 1/4c is illustrated in Fig.3. The metamaterial medium (1) outside the
warp bubble is engineered to have properties of a medium moving towards the warp
bubble with the designed warp speed, while medium (3) is “moving” away from the
bubble. In the reference frame moving with the warp speed these media look exactly the

~
x)
same as medium (2) at rest. Ray trajectories were calculated assuming a step-like f ( ~
profile. Rays are emitted by a point source located at the origin point (0,0,0) of the
coordinate frame inside the “warp bubble” (marked as medium (2)). Boundaries of the
warp bubble are located at x=±5 (they are marked by the dashed lines). At large enough
incidence angles light rays originating inside the “warp bubble” cannot penetrate into
medium (3) (in the hypothetical superluminal warp drive this would be true for any
incidence angle: this boundary would look like a white hole event horizon). On the

9

other hand, all the light rays propagating towards the other boundary of the “warp
bubble” can propagate into medium (1). Note that the metamaterial medium (1) is
identical to medium (3).
In conclusion, we have presented a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre
warp drive metric. It appears that the material parameter range introduces strong
limitations on the achievable “warp speed”, so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials
cannot emulate the warp drive. On the other hand, newly developed “perfect”
magnetoelectric bi-anisotropic non-reciprocal metamaterials should be capable of
emulating the physics of gradually accelerating warp drive, which can reach “warp
speeds” up to 1/4c.
