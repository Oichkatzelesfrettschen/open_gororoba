   Recently, plausibility arguments for entanglement
wedge reconstruction have been developing along two dif-
ferent lines. [24] proposed a re-interpretation of causal
wedge reconstruction as quantum error correction, which
is a structure that very naturally allows an extension to
entanglement wedge reconstruction. This was explicitly
realized in toy models [25, 26]. At the same time it has
gradually been understood that a proposal [27] for the
first 1/N correction to the HRT formula is indicative               FIG. 1. Factorizing the bulk and boundary on a time slice.
