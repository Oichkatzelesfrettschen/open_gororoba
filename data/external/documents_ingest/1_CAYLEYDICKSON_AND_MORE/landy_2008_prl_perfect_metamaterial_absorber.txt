                   We present the design for an absorbing metamaterial (MM) with near unity absorbance A!. Our
                structure consists of two MM resonators that couple separately to electric and magnetic fields so as to
                absorb all incident radiation within a single unit cell layer. We fabricate, characterize, and analyze a MM
                absorber with a slightly lower predicted A! of 96%. Unlike conventional absorbers, our MM consists
                solely of metallic elements. The substrate can therefore be optimized for other parameters of interest. We
                experimentally demonstrate a peak A! greater than 88% at 11.5 GHz.
