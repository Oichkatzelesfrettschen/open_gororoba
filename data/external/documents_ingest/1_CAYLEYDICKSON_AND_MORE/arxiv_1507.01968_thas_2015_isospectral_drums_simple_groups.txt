                                                   A BSTRACT . Virtually every known pair of isospectral but nonisometric manifolds
                                                   — with as most famous members isospectral bounded R-planar domains which
                                                   makes one “not hear the shape of a drum” [13] — arise from the (group theoret-
                                                   ical) Gassman-Sunada method. Moreover, all the known R-planar examples (so
                                                   counter examples to Kac’s question) are constructed through a famous specializa-

                                                   We first describe a number of very general classes of length equivalent manifolds,
                                                   with as particular cases isospectral manifolds, in each of the constructions start-
                                                   ing from a given example that arises itself from the Gassman-Sunada method. The
                                                   constructions include the examples arising from the transplantation technique (and
                                                   thus in particular the planar examples). To that end, we introduce four properties
                                                   — called FF, MAX, PAIR and INV — inspired by natural physical properties (which
                                                   rule out trivial constructions), that are satisfied for each of the known planar ex-
                                                   amples.
                                                   Vice versa, we show that length equivalent manifolds with FF, MAX, PAIR and INV
                                                   which arise from the Gassman-Sunada method, must fall under one of our prior
                                                   constructions, thus describing a precise classification of these objects.
                                                   Due to the nature of our constructions and properties, a deep connection with fi-
                                                   nite simple groups occurs which seems, perhaps, rather surprising in the context of
                                                   this paper. On the other hand, our properties define physically irreducible pairs of
                                                   length equivalent manifolds — “atoms” of general pairs of length equivalent mani-
                                                   folds, in that such a general pair of manifolds is patched up out of irreducible pairs
                                                   — and that is precisely what simple groups are for general groups.

             1. I NTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE MAIN RESULTS

In 1966, in a celebrated paper [13], Mark Kac formulated the famous question “Can
one hear the shape of a drum?”: is it possible to find two nonisometric Euclidean
simply connected domains for which the sets {En |n ∈ N} of solutions of

(1)                                 ∆f + Ef = 0,

where ∆ is the d-dimensional Laplacian and with Ψ|Boundary = 0, are identical?
It was known very early, from Weyl’s formula, that one can “hear” the area of a
drum and the length of its perimeter. But could the shape itself be retrieved from
the spectrum?


Formally, answering “no” to Kac’s question amounts to finding isospectral billiards,
that is, nonisometric billiards having exactly the same eigenvalue spectrum (with
multiplicities). Since the appearance of [13], an incredible amount of variations on
the theme have found their way through literature.
Very early examples of flat tori sharing the same eigenvalue spectrum had been
found in 1964 by Milnor in R16 in his classic note [17], from nonisometric lat-
tices of rank 16 in R16 . Other examples of isospectral Riemannian manifolds were
constructed later, e.g., on lens spaces [12] or on surfaces with constant negative
curvature [32]. In 1982, Urakawa produced the first examples of isospectral do-
mains in Rn , n ≥ 4 [31], applying work of Bérard and Besson [2].
In the late eighties, various other papers appeared, giving necessary conditions that
any family of billiards sharing the same spectrum should fulfill ([16], [19], [20]),
and necessary conditions given as inequalities on the eigenvalues were reviewed in
[21].



1.1. Planar counter examples. It took almost 30 years after Kac’s paper that the
first example of two-dimensional billiards having exactly the same spectrum was
exhibited (in 1992). The pair was found by Gordon, Webb and Wolpert in the
paper “Isospectral plane domains and surfaces via Riemannian orbifolds” [9]. The
authors thus gave a “no” as a final answer to Kac’s question, and as a reply to Kac’s
paper, they published a paper titled “One cannot hear the shape of a drum” [10].
The most popularized example is shown in Figure 1.
Crucial for finding the example was a theorem by Sunada asserting that when two
subgroups that are “almost conjugate” in a group that acts by isometries on a Rie-
mannian manifold, the quotient manifolds are isospectral. In fact, the other exam-
ples which were constructed after 1992 virtually all used Sunada’s method. Later,
the so-called “transplantation technique” was introduced, giving an easier way of
detecting isospectrality of planar billiards. (Still, essentially only seventeen families
of examples that say “no” to Kac’s question were constructed in a forty year period.)
We refer to [8] for an extensive review on the modern theory after Kac.

        square shaped base tiles. The dotted lines are just an eyeguide.


1.2. More on Sunada’s method. For M a Riemannian manifold, one defines the
zeta function
                                ∞
                                X
(2)                    ζM (s) =   λ−s
                                   i , Re(s) ≥ 0,
                                      i=1

where 0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · are the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian for M. The
function ζM has an analytic continuation to the whole plane, and it is well known
that ζM1 (s) = ζM2 (s) if and only if M1 and M2 are isospectral.
The next theorem is important.
Theorem 1.1 (T. Sunada [25]). Let π : M 7→ M0 be a normal finite Riemannian
covering with covering transformation group G, and let π1 : M1 7→ M0 and π2 : M2 7→
M0 be the coverings corresponding to the subgroups H1 and H2 of G, respectively. If
the triplet (G, H1 , H2 ) satisfies the property that each conjugacy class of G meets H1
and H2 in the same number of elements, then the zeta functions ζM1 (s) and ζM2 (s)
are identical.

Triples as in the theorem are called “Gassman-Sunada triples,” and one also says
that H1 and H2 are “almost conjugate’ in G (and (G, H1 , H2 ) is an almost conjugate
or AC-triple).
Expressed in terms of isospectrality, we have the following version of Theorem 1.1.
Let M be a closed hyperbolic n-manifold, G a group, and H and K almost conjugate
subgroups of G. Then if π1 (M) admits a homomorphism onto G, the covers MH
and MK associated to the pullback subgroups of H and K are isospectral.

This bridge between spectral theory and Group Theory gave a strong impetus to
the construction theory for isospectral manifolds, and indeed, the first counter ex-
amples to the original question of Kac — namely in the planar case over R — arose
via that bridge.



1.3. Different directions. Almost conjugacy has occurred (independently) in var-
ious other parts of Mathematics and Physics. For instance, let K be a finite Galois
extension of Q with Galois group G = Gal(K/Q), and let K1 and K2 be subfields
of K corresponding to subgroups G1 and G2 of G, respectively. Then the zeta func-
tions of K1 and K2 are the same if and only if G1 and G2 are almost conjugate
in G. In particular, if G1 and G2 are not conjugate in G, then K1 and K2 are not
isomorphic while having the same zeta function.
The theme of isospectrality of surfaces has occurred, in one of its many guises, and
often independently, in (but not restricted to) the following list.

      • Acoustics.
      • Quantum Chaos.
      • Nonlinear Dynamics.
      • Topology of Manifolds.
      • Combinatorial Theory.
      • Number Theory.
      • Group Theory.
      • ...




1.4. The EC condition as a setting for construction and classification. Call a
group triple (G, H, K) an EC-triple if each element of H is conjugate to some ele-
ment in H (and vice versa). Such triples generalize AC-triples, and H and K are
said to be elementwise conjugate in G.
In the same vein as Sunada’s Theorem 1.1, one can obtain the following result.
Let M be a closed hyperbolic n-manifold, G a group, and H and K elementwise
conjugate subgroups of G. Then if π1 (M) admits a homomorphism onto G, the
covers MH and MK associated to the pullback subgroups of H and K are length
equivalent.
For our purposes it is more convenient to first study the EC-property, since it is
more flexible in several ways, e.g., for manupilation in induction arguments. As
AC implies EC, any classification result on the broader class of EC-triples (G, H, K)
will yield direct results for the AC-triples.
But there is more. In some sense, the EC-property reflects a combinatorial property
of an underlying incidence geometry (which I have described in this text), which
is a crucial tool in the whole theory that is set up in this paper (and we will come
back to this geometry in a near future).

1.5. The present paper. We start this paper with a detailed explanation of the con-
nection between the notions of “transplantability” and “almost conjugacy,” which
are crucial in the construction theory of planar isospectral billiards. We then dis-
cuss the related notions AC-triple (or Gassman-Sunada triple) and EC-triple (which
naturally generalizes AC-triples), in the context of isospectral drumheads (in any
dimension). Next, we explore some “naive” constructions of EC-triples, starting
from one given EC-triple, through direct products and “adding kernels.” Then we
will introduce four properties — being FF, MAX, PAIR, INV — inspired by physical
properties which “irreducible” drumheads should have on the one hand, and which
planar examples have, on the other.
We will introduce a set of extremely general construction procedures of EC-triples
with FF and MAX (starting from a given one), which due to MAX, is connected to
the O’Nan-Scott Theorem of finite Group Theory, and which involves finite simple
groups. Contrary to the fact that most known examples of isospectral manifolds
arise from solvable groups (see for instance de Smit and Lenstra [4]) — in partic-
ular, from two-step nilpotent (p)-groups such as the finite Heisenberg group (see
for instance Guralnick [11]) — our examples live at the complete other end of the
spectrum: they essentially arise from finite simple groups!

        simple groups + data −→ irred. length equiv. manifolds

In a final stage, we will classify EC-triples, by starting from EC-triples with FF, MAX,
PAIR and INV, and we will show that, indeed, any such example is constructed
through one of our procedures. The property MAX allows us to use the O’Nan-Scott
Theorem to some extent. In particular, all the known planar counter examples to
Kac’s question “Can one hear the shape of a drum” eventually arise, after careful
analysis of the properties beyond O’Nan-Scott.

In such a way, we will obtain a deep connection between irreducible (possibly
higher-dimensional) drumheads and finite simple groups that offers a new direction
in the theory.

                                    2. T ILES AND TRANSPLANTATION

All known pairs of planar isospectral billiards can be described through Gassman-
Sunada group triples which have a very specific form. In this section, we analyze
this situation. We also clarify the notion of “transplantation” in its connection with
AC, a subject which seems to be obscured at some places in the literature.

2.1. Involution graphs. All known isospectral billiards can be obtained by unfold-
ing polygonal-shaped tiles — see [8], but essentially one can only consider triangles.
The way the tiles are unfolded can be specified by three permutation (N × N )-
matrices M (µ) , 1 ≤ µ ≤ 3 and N ∈ N× , associated with the three sides of the
triangle:
                (µ)
         • Mij = 1 if tiles i and j are glued by their side µ;
                (µ)
         • Mii = 1 if the side µ of tile i is on the boundary of the billiard, and
         • 0 otherwise.
The number of tiles is, of course, N .
One can encrypt the action of the M (µ) “in” a graph with colored edges: each copy
of the base tile is associated with a vertex, and vertices i and j, i 6= j, are joined
                                          (µ)
by an edge of color µ if and only if Mij = 1. In the same way, in the second
member of the pair, the tiles are unfolded according to permutation matrices N (µ) ,
1 ≤ µ ≤ 3. We call such a colored graph an involution graph (for reasons to be
made clear later on).
Remark 2.1. As motivated in [8], we assume the hypothesis that these involutions
graphs are trees.

2.2. Transplantability. Two “polygonally tiled” billiards are said to be transplantable
if there exists an invertible matrix T — the transplantation matrix — such that
(3)                          T M (µ) = N (µ) T for all µ.

Define GM := hM (µ) | µ = 1, 2, 3i (with ordinary matrix multiplication) and
GN := hN (µ) | µ = 1, 2, 3i; then GM and GN are subgroups of GLN (C), and the
existence of the invertible matrix T precisely expresses the fact that GN and GM are
equivalent (= isomorphic) GLN (C)-linear representations of the same group.
Remark 2.3. We note that the M (µ) -elements and N (ν) -elements are involutions.

On the other hand, since the M (i) and N (j) are permutation matrices, GM and
GN are subgroups of the symmetric group SN — that is, they both come with an
action on Υ = {1, 2, . . . , N }. Now the aforementioned linear representations are
equivalent if and only if they have the same permutation character — i.e., there
exists an isomorphism
(4)                                χ : GM −→ GN
such that
(5)                       #Fix(g) = #Fix(g χ ) ∀ g ∈ GM .

Note that the permutation groups (GM , Υ) and (GN , Υ) are respectively similar
to the actions given by left translation on the left coset spaces (GM , GM /U ) and
(GN , GN /V ), where U = (GM )x is an arbitrary point stabilizer in (GM , Υ), and
V = (GN )y an arbitrary point stabilizer in (GN , Υ). After applying T (by conju-
gation), we obtain permutation representations (GM , GM /U ) and (GM , GM /V T )
with the same permutation character.

Conversely, let (G, X) and (G, Y ) be two faithful transitive permutation groups of
the same degree. As we have seen, we can identify both actions similarly with
left translation actions (G, G/U ) and (G, G/V ) with U, V subgroups of G, and [G :
U ] = [G : V ]. Now (G, X) and (G, Y ) have the same permutation character if and
only if AC is satisfied for (G, U, V ).
Let k ∈ {Q, R, C}, and let V := k[G/H] be the k-vector space defined by the formal
sums over k with base the elements of the left coset space G/H, H any subgroup
of G. Then G acts naturally on V by left translation. If B is the (standard) base
of V corresponding to G/H, it is clear that G naturally defines a subgroup GH of
GLℓ (V ), with ℓ = [G : H] (by its action on B and linear extension). In this way,
we have a faithful k-linear representation
(6)                            ρH : G ֒→ GLℓ (V ).

Now AC is satisfied for (G, U, V ) if and only if ρU and ρV are equivalent, that is, if
and only if there exists a T ∈ GLℓ (V ) such that for all g ∈ G,
(7)                            ρU (g) ◦ T = T ◦ ρV (g).
(Here, k[G/U ] and k[G/V ] are naturally identified.)

Theorem 2.4 (Transplantability). Two faithful permutation representations (G, G/U )
and (G, G/V ) of the same degree (with U and V subgroups of the group G) have the
same permutation character if and only if AC is satisfied for (G, U, V ) if and only if
the faithful k-linear representations ρU and ρV are k-linearly equivalent if and only
there exists a T ∈ GLℓ (V ) such that for all g ∈ G, ρU (g) ◦ T = T ◦ ρV (g).

In other words: almost conjugacy and transplantability express the same property.
Abstractly, we will sum up some equivalent properties in the next section.

2.3. Connection with shape. If the matrix T is a permutation matrix, the two
domains would just have the same shape (i.e., are isometric), and vice versa.

2.4. Analysis of the known examples. All known planar counter examples (DU , DV )
to Kac’s question are transplantable, i.e., come from Gassman-Sunada data (G, U, V );
see e.g. [8]. Much more can be said about the triples.
      (i) In all known examples, the group G is isomorphic to the classical simple
          group PSLn (q), where (n, q) ∈ {(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 2), (3, 4)}, cf. [3].
     (ii) In all these examples, U and V are maximal subgroups of G.
    (iii) Also, the T -elements are involutions which play the role of a duality of
          a naturally associated projective space PG(n − 1, q), on which the M (µ) -
          elements, the N (ν) -elements and PSLn (q) naturally act as automorphisms.
    (iv) By combined work of O. Giraud and K. Thas, it follows that, conversely, all
          transplantable pairs arising from the special linear group, and satisfying
          Equation (8) below, are the known ones. This was observed in [7, 26, 27,
          28].
We also mention the following result.
Lemma 2.5 (Y. Okada and A. Shudo [18]). All isospectral transplantable drums,
that unfold an r-gon N times, are known if N ≤ 13.

Fixed points equation. The involution graph of DU (respectively DV ) which was
earlier defined is the so-called (undirected) “Schreier coset graph” of G with re-
spect to U (respectively V ) relative to {M (µ) } (respectively {N (ν) }) — which is a
generating set of involutions of G — by definition.
As the Schreier graphs under consideration are trees (cf. Remark 2.1), the following
identity holds:
                                     X r
(8)                       (r − 2)Λ =      Fix (χ(j) ) − 2,
                                        j=1

where Fix(χ ) is the number of fixed points of χ(j) in the permutation group
             (j)

(Gχ , Gχ /S), with χ = M, N and S = U, V respectively; see [8]. Here, Λ is the
number of tiles, and r is the gonality of the base polygon, which may be taken to
equal 3.

                      3. E LEMENTWISE AND ALMOST CONJUGACY

The following properties are easily shown to be equivalent. Let H, H ′ be subgroups
of a finite group G.
      (a) H and H ′ are almost conjugate (AC) (that is, (G, H ′ , H ′ ) is a Gassmann-
          Sunada triple).
      (b) There exists a bijection B : H −→ H ′ such that for each h ∈ H, B(h) is
          conjugate to h in G.
      (c) For all g ∈ G, we have that |g G ∩ H| = |g G ∩ H ′ |.
Theorem 3.1 (AC and Isospectrality). Let M be a closed hyperbolic n-manifold, G
a group, and H and K almost conjugate subgroups of G. Then if π1 (M) admits a
homomorphism onto G, the covers MH and MK associated to the pullback subgroups
of H and K are isospectral.
We say that subgroups H and H ′ of a finite group G are elementwise conjugate if for
each g ∈ G we have that
(9)                         g G ∩ H 6= ∅ ⇐⇒ g G ∩ H ′ 6= ∅
The following properties are equivalent.
       (i) H and H ′ are almost elementwise conjugate (EC).
      (ii) Each element of H ′ is conjugate to an element of H and each element of
           H is conjugate to some element of H ′ .
For M a compact Riemannian manifold, let L(M) be the set of lengts of closed
geodesics of M (that is, L(M) is the length spectrum without multiplicities). Then
two such manifolds M and M e are length equivalent if L(M) = L( e
                                                               M).
Expressed in terms of isospectrality-related properties, we have the following ver-
sion of Theorem 3.1.
Theorem 3.2 (EC and Length Equivalence). Let M be a closed hyperbolic n-manifold,
G a group, and H and K elementwise conjugate subgroups of G. Then if π1 (M) ad-
mits a homomorphism onto G, the covers MH and MK associated to the pullback
subgroups of H and K are length equivalent.
The following is obvious.
Observation 3.3. Let (G, H, H ′ ) be a Gassmann-Sunada triple. Then H and H ′ are
elementwise conjugate in G.
So in general we have
(10)                                AC −→ EC.
The converse is not necessarily true — one cannot even conclude that H and H ′
have the same order! For example, let An be the alternating group on n letters
(n ≥ 3), and consider commuting involutions (transpositions) α and β. Then H =
{id, α} and H ′ = {id, α, β, αβ} are EC (and certainly not AC).
Still, for our purposes it is more convenient to first study the EC-property, since it
is more flexible in several ways (e.g. for manupilation in induction arguments). As
AC implies EC, any classification result on the broader class of EC-triples (G, H, H ′ )
will yield direct results for the AC-triples.

                      4. C ONSTRUCTION OF ISOSPECTRAL DRUMS

In this section, we want to construct isospectral drums (not necessarily planar)
arising from Gassman-Sunada group triples (G, H, H ′ ). We will define a class D of
drums which contains all presently known examples of isospectral planar drums.
Our way to construct starts from a known example, and makes an infinite class of
examples out of it.
We start very generally, with generic constructions which give rise to many EC-
triples. We always start from some Gassman-Sunada triple, or more generally
with an EC-triple. We then fine-tune our construction in such a way that the
drums which come out satisfy some strong properties which are suggested by the
physics of the game (cf. the next subsection). On the other hand, we want every
drum/triple which is constructed to inherit certain properties from the initial ex-
ample. This also means that an initial triple (G, H, H ′ ) has to satisfy a number of
properties in order to make it eligible for our method to apply. Our model example
will be the projective linear groups PGLn (q) over a finite field Fq .
So the idea is this: in each step of our theoretic construction, the construction
becomes more and more general, and produces a wealth of (new) examples of
triples/drums. But in order to apply it, in each step, the needed base triples be-
come more specialized (but at this point only slightly). After having established
the construction method the connection with simple groups will be revealed in the
next section,.

4.1. Properties FF, MAX, INV and PAIR. We will give extra attention to the follow-
ing properties, which are partly motivated by the list of known isospectral planar
drums.

Recall that a subgroup U, · of a group V, · is normal if for every (u, v) ∈ U × V , we
have that
(11)                                 v −1 · u · v ∈ U.
(Below, we will omit the “·-notation” if the group operation is clear.)
       FF The FF-property expresses the fact that the actions G y G/H and G y
          G/H ′ are faithful. This means that there are no nontrivial normal sub-
          groups of G contained in H and H ′ . Note that if N is a normal subgroup
          of G inside H, N is also contained in H ′ , since each element of H ′ is con-
          jugate to some element in H, and N is self-conjugate. This assumption is
          natural, since dividing out normal subgroups yields the same drums. (“The
          drums do not see these normal subgroups.”)


P RINCIPLE 4.1 (FF). By its mere definition, any example of isospectral drums coming
from involution graphs à la Okada-Shudo is FF.                                   ∇


     MAX MAX expresses the fact that both H and H ′ are maximal subgroups of G,
         i.e., if A is a subgroup of G containing H (respectively H ′ ), then either
         A = G or A = H (respectively A = G or A = H ′ ). This is an irreducibility
                          ISOSPECTRAL DRUMS AND SIMPLE GROUPS                      11


        assumption, as in some way MAX-examples represent irreducible exam-
        ples; if for instance H would not be maximal, it might happen that there
        are proper subgroups A, B of G for which H ≤ A 6= H and H ′ ≤ B 6= H ′
        such that (G, A, B) is also Gassman-Sunada/EC. And then physically, the
        drums coming from the data (G, H, H ′ ) consist of the smaller drums com-
        ing from the data (G, A, B).


P RINCIPLE 4.2 (MAX). Asking that H and H ′ are maximal means that the drums are
not built from smaller ones.                                                  ∇


   INV By Involution Formula, we known that transplantable planar drums satisfy
       equation (8). The existence of involutions satisfying (8) is INV.
  PAIR In the known planar examples, there is an outer automorphism of G which
       maps H to H ′ — in those cases, G is isomorphic to a general special pro-
       jective linear group over some finite field, and H is the stabilizer of some
       point (in the action on the associated projective space), and H ′ the stabi-
       lizer of some hyperplane, cf. §§4.5 and 4.7. The outer automorphism is
       associated to a duality of the projective space. PAIR expresses this fact:
       PAIR is satisfied for (G, H, H ′ ) if there is some σ ∈ Out(G)× such that
       H σ = H ′ and σ 2 ∈ Inn(H). In fact, in most cases in which we will need
       PAIR, much more general versions suffice. As we will see, often it will be
       enough to ask that |H| = |H ′ |.


4.2. Adding kernels. Let (S, L, L′ ) be a Gassman-Sunada triple which is FF. Let K
be any group, and consider (S × K, L × K, L′ × K). Here A × B, with A and B
denoting groups, is the direct product of A and B. It consists of all elements of the
Cartesian product of A and B, and the group law is
(12)                           (a, b) · (a′ b′ ) := (aa′ , bb′ ).
Note that conjugation works as follows:
(13)       (a, b)(u,v) = (u, v)−1 (a, b)(u, v) = (u−1 au, v −1 bv) = (au , bv ).

As (S, L, L′ ) is Gassman-Sunada, there is a bijection B : L −→ L′ such that for
s ∈ L, B(s) is conjugate to s (in S). Now define the bijection B as
(14)                B : L × K −→ L′ × K : (s, k) −→ (B(s), k).
We know that B(s) = sg for some g ∈ S; it follows that (B(s), k) = (s, k)(g,1) , so
that (S × K, L × K, L′ × K) clearly also is Gassman-Sunada.
But of course, no new information is added, as (S × K, L × K, L′ × K) is not
FF — {id} × K obviously is a normal subgroup of S and it is contained in both
L × K, L′ × K.
Remark 4.3 (EC-Triples). Exactly the same procedure also works when we start
with EC-triples. And FF remains valid throughout the construction.
Remark 4.4 (Arbitrary products). Note that K is arbitrary, so can be replaced by
any finite product of finte groups.
12                                      KOEN THAS


We will change this procedure slightly, so that we can sustain the FF-property when
passing to “bigger examples.”


4.3. Passing to products. Start again from data (S, L, L′ ), and consider (S ×S, L×
L, L′ × L′ ). Suppose that (S, L, L′ ) is FF.
Let B be as above, and define B as follows:
(15)                B : L × L −→ L′ × L′ : (s, t) −→ (B(s), B(t))
We know that there are g, h in S such that B(s) = sg and B(t) = th , so (B(s), B(t)) =
(s, t)(u,v) , and B obviously is a bijection. It follows that (S × S, L × L, L′ × L′ ) is
Gassman-Sunada.
The same can be concluded when starting from an EC-triple (S, L, L′ ) (i.e., (S ×
S, L × L, L′ × L′ ) is then EC).
We need to check FF, so suppose that N is a normal subgroup of S × S contained in
L×L (and so also in L′ ×L′ ). Let π1 be the projection of N onto the first component
in S × S (that is, π1 (n, m) = n for (n, m) in S × S), and let π2 be the projection
on the second component. Suppose one of the images, say π1 (N ) is different from
{id} and L; then π1 (N ) obviously is a normal subgroup of S inside L, contradicting
the fact that (S, L, L′ ) is FF. If this property does not hold for both π1 and π2 , then
πi (N ) must be either {id} or L, and for at least one component, say the second, we
have π2 (N ) = L. And then L is a normal subgroup of S.
If (S, L, L′ ) is Gassman-Sunada, we have a contradiction as L and L′ are AC, so
that L ✂ S would imply L = L′ .
Now let (S, L, L′ ) be an EC-triple, and let L be a normal subgroup of S. Let l′ ∈
L′ \ L; as l′ is conjugate to some element l in L, we obtain a contradiction as
lS ⊆ L. As N ≤ (L × L) ∩ (L′ × L′ ), π2 (N ) = L ≤ L′ . We thus conclude that
L = L′ , contradiction.

P RINCIPLE 4.5 (Inheritance of FF). Let (S, L, L′ ) be an EC-triple (so that as a par-
ticular case we have Gassman-Sunada triples); then our construction is guaranteed to
give us an example with FF.                                                         ∇


And clearly, instead of considering a product with two components, we can do
exactly the same reasoning on any finite number of components.

Observation 4.6. If (S, L, L′ ) is Gassman-Sunada with FF, or more generally (S, L, L′ )
                                                                                  ×k
is an EC-triple with FF, and k 6= 0 is any positive integer, then (S ×k , L×k , L′ ) is also
Gassman-Sunada with FF.                                                                   


Here, A×k denotes the direct product A × · · · × A with k factors.
But there is a catch: even if we would assume that L and L′ are maximal subgroups
of S, L × L and L′ × L′ certainly are not, as for example L × L ≤ L × S. So MAX
is not inherited if we pass to products.
We need a more subtle approach.

4.4. Products with a twist. Now consider an EC-triple (S, L, L′ ), with FF (MAX is
not needed for now). We pass to (S × S, L × L, L′ × L′ ) as above, which is also FF by
Principle 4.5. Now consider S2 = hσi =: B, the symmetric group acting on {1, 2}
(σ = σ −1 ). If (s1 , s2 ) ∈ S × S, we define σ((s1 , s2 )) as
(16)                            (sσ−1 (1) , sσ−1 (2) ) = (s2 , s1 ).

Put A := S × S, and define a group A ⋊ B as follows. Its elements are just of the
form (a, b) with a ∈ A and b ∈ B, but the group operation is given by
(17)                           (a, b) · (a′ , b′ ) := (ab(a′ ), bb′ ).
By definition, A ⋊ B is the wreath product S ≀ B of S by B. Note that A and B
naturally are (isomorphic to) subgroups of A ⋊ B; note also that A is (isomorphic
to) a normal subgroup of A ⋊ B.

Let (l, r), (n, h) be elements of A ⋊ B; then
(18)
 (n, h)(l,r) = (l, r)−1 (n, h)(l, r) = (r−1 (l−1 ), r−1 )(n, h)(l, r) = (r−1 (l−1 nh(l)), hr ).
In particular, if r = 1, then we obtain that (n, h)(l,r) = (l−1 nh(l), h).

Define subgroups H and H ′ of G := A ⋊ B by H := (L × L) ⋊ B and H ′ :=
(L′ × L′ ) ⋊ B. It is clear that L × L and L′ × L′ can be naturally seen as subgroups
of index two of respectively H and H ′ .
                                                      e as follows:
Now let B : L × L −→ L′ × L′ be as before, and define B
(19)                        e : H −→ H ′ : (n, b) −→ (B(n), b).
                            B
Here, n ∈ L × L and b ∈ hσi = B. The fact that B is a bijection from L × L to
                             e is a bijection between H and H ′ .
L′ × L′ readily implies that B

To show that H and H ′ are EC in G, we need to show that for all h′ ∈ H ′ , we can
find u ∈ G and h ∈ H such that hu = h′ . By the above, this property is certainly
true for the subgroup L′ × L′ of H ′ (each of its elements is conjugate in G to some
element of L × L). So it is sufficient only to consider elements of type (n, σ) in
H ′ (where n = (a, b) ∈ L′ × L′ ). The symmetrical argument then yields that the
obtained triple is EC. So we seek for (l, δ) ∈ G (with l = (l1 , l2 ) ∈ S × S and
δ ∈ {id, σ}) and (r, σ) (with r ∈ L × L) such that
(20)                                  (r, σ)(l,δ) = (n, σ).

Plugging this into equation (18), we obtain the following equations, the first being
for δ = σ, the second for δ = id, and the third being a trivial equation:

                      
                       r     = lσ(n)σ(l)−1          = (l1 bl2−1 , l2 al1−1 )
(21)                    r     =   lnσ(l)−1           = (l1 al2−1 , l2 bl1−1 )
                      
                        σ     =      σ.
14                                          KOEN THAS


P RINCIPLE 4.7 (Reduction to the base group S). Since (a, b) ∈ L′ × L′ is essen-
tially arbitrary, both equations boil down to one: we need (l1 , l2 ) ∈ S × S such that
(l1 al2−1 , l2 bl1−1 ) ∈ L × L. In fact, since l2 bl1−1 ∈ S if and only if l1 b−1 l2−1 ∈ S, and
since b is arbitrary, we need (l1 , l2 ) ∈ S × S such that (l1 al2−1 , l1 bl2−1 ) ∈ L × L.   ∇

Remark 4.8 (EC and its geometry). At this point, one has to start specifying the
initial triple (S, L, L′ ) in order to play the game. We will introduce a fundamental
example in the next subsection. Much seems to depend on detailed knowledge
of the natural (geometric) modules on which the groups act. However, we will
surprisingly observe that this is not true, and that the geometric property we need
naturally comes from the EC-property (in fact, it is even equivalent). This is another
reason why the class of EC-triples is a more natural candidate to study for our
purposes than the class of AC-triples.


4.5. Model example: the general linear groups. Consider the simple group PGLn (F)
(over any commutative field F, n ∈ N× \ {1}), and put S = PGLn (F). As we
have seen earlier, S acts naturally on the linear subspaces of the projective space
PG(n − 1, F). Let L := Sx be the stabilizer in S of a point x in PG(n − 1, F), and
let L′ = SΠ be the stabilizer in S of a hyperplane Π in PG(n − 1, F). It is well
known and easy to see that (S, Sx , SΠ ) has the EC-property. (If n = 2, Sx and SΠ
are conjugate, though.)
Remark 4.9. The choice of (x, Π) is not important, as the reader will see.

So a, b both stabilize Π, and hence ab−1 has the same property. A well-known
property for projective spaces tells us that ab−1 therefore must fix some point y of
the space. This means that
(22)                                     a(y) = b(y) = y ′
for some point y ′ .

Let l1−1 map y to x (note that such elements certainly exist!), and let l2 map x to
y ′ (same remark). A standard property of permutation groups now tells us that all
elements in S that map y to y ′ are in the set
(23)                                         l1−1 Sx l2 ,
and hence (l1 al2−1 , l1 bl2−1 ) ∈ Sx × Sx = L × L.

Proposition 4.10 (Linear groups and 2-cycles). Put
(24)              (S, L, L′ ) = (PGLn (F), PGLn (F)x , PGLn (F)Π )
with (x, Π) any point-hyperplane pair. Then (S ≀ S2 , L ≀ S2 , L′ ≀ S2 ) is an EC-triple. 

We will observe further on how this construction behaves with respect to the prop-
erties we introduced in the beginning of this section. First, we want to replace the
involutive action by a 3-cycle action. This will lead us to the general construction,
which will handle wreath products of simple groups with any transitive subgroup of
the symmetric group.


4.6. 3-Products with a 3-cycle. Consider an EC-triple (S, L, L′ ), with FF (MAX is
again not asked). We pass to (S × S × S, L × L × L, L′ × L′ × L′ ) as above, which is
also FF by Principle 4.5. Now consider any γ ∈ S3 , the symmetric group acting on
{1, 2, 3}. If (s1 , s2 , s3 ) ∈ S × S × S, we define γ((s1 , s2 , s3 )) as
(25)                             (sγ −1 (1) , sγ −1 (2) , sγ −1 (3) ).

Put A := S × S × S, and define a group S ≀ B as in the previous subsection (see also
the next remark), where B ≤ Sym(3) is supposed to be transitive.
Remark 4.11 (Wreath products). Let G be any group, and let P be a subgroup of
the symmetric group Sym(Ω) acting on the finite set Ω 6= ∅. The wreath product
G ≀ P of G by P is defined as follows. Its elements are of the form (g, p) with g ∈ GΩ
(which is the Cartesian product of |Ω| copies of G, indexed by Ω) and p ∈ P , while
the group operation is given as before by
(26)                          (g, p) · (g ′ , p′ ) := (gp(g ′ ), pp′ ).
Here, with g ′ = (gω )ω∈Ω ,
(27)                               p(g ′ ) := (gp−1 (ω) )ω∈Ω .
One notes that G and P are naturally isomorphic to subgroups of G ≀ P , and that G
becomes a normal subgroup under this natural identification.


To show that H and H ′ are EC in G, we need to show that for all h′ ∈ H ′ , we can
find u ∈ G and h ∈ H such that hu = h′ . By the above, this property is certainly
true for the subgroup L′ × L′ × L′ of H ′ (each of its elements is conjugate in G to
some element of L × L × L, even in a bijective correspondence). So it is sufficient
only to consider elements of type (n, γ) in H ′ (where n = (a1 , a2 , a3 ) ∈ L′ ×L′ ×L′ ).
So we seek for (l, δ) ∈ G (with l = (l1 , l2 , l3 ) ∈ S × S × S and δ ∈ B) and (r, γ ′ )
(with r ∈ L × L × L and γ ′ ∈ B) such that
(28)                                 (r, γ ′ )(l,δ) = (n, γ).

Plugging this into equation (18), we obtain the following equations, the first being
                                                                        δ
for δ = σ, the second for δ = id. (For general δ ∈ B, one needs that γ ′ = γ, but we
                                            ′
will show below that the case δ = id and γ = γ already suffices to find solutions.)
So below, we let γ ′ = γ.

4.7. Model example: the general linear groups. We show again that with S =
PGLn (q) (n, q as above), L = Sx and L′ = SΠ (x and Π as above), we can make
the desired properties work. We choose an “arbitrary” γ ∈ S3 , but we assume it to
be a regular 3-cycle (that is, it generates a sharply transitive subgroup of S3 ). The
reason is that if it is not of this form, the existence of the desired (l1 , l2 , l3 ) follows
from it cycle decomposition together with the fact that we already obtained the
result for n = 2. In any case, the technique we present also works for any cycle.
Choose for instance (and without loss of generality) the permutation

                                          γ(3) =          2,
so that we must check one of the conditions

We solve, as before, the second set of equations.
As a1 , a2 , a3 are elements of SΠ , their inverses are in SΠ as well, and so a2 ◦a−1
                                                                                   1 ◦a3 is
also in SΠ . As before, we know this element fixes some point, say y. Put a3 (y) =: y1
and a1 ◦ a3 (y) =: y2 ; then a2 (y2 ) = y. Now choose elements l1 , l2 , l3 such that:

                                        
                                         l1 (x)      = y1

4.8. The general case: general twists. Consider an EC-triple (S, L, L′ ), with FF
(MAX is again not needed for the construction). Take any n ∈ N× . We pass to
                ×n
(S ×n , L×n , L′ ) as above, which is also FF. Now we take any transitive subgroup
B in the symmetric group Sn , acting naturally on {1, . . . , n}. If (s1 , . . . , sn ) ∈ S ×n ,
we define γ((s1 , . . . , sn )) for any γ ∈ B as
(33)                               (sγ −1 (1) , . . . , sγ −1 (n) ).

Put A := S ×n , and define G := S ≀ B, H := L ≀ B and H ′ := L′ ≀ B as before.
To show that H and H ′ are EC in G, we consider any element ((a1 , . . . , an ), γ) ∈
        ×n
H ′ = L′ ⋊ B, and we show that it is conjugate to some (r, γ) ∈ H = L×n ⋊ B
through some element of the form ((l1 , . . . , ln ), id). It is not necessary to consider
elements with trivial γ, since they already have the required property.
So we want to solve the set of equations

                n
(34)                r   =   lnγ(l)−1      = (l1 a1 lγ−1                       −1
                                                      −1 (1) , . . . , ln an lγ −1 (n) ).




4.9. General theory: solving equation (34), and EC-geometry. Before proceed-
ing, let (C, D, D′ ) be an EC-triple. Define “points” as being the elements of the left
coset space X = {cD|c ∈ C} and “hyperplanes” as being elements of the left coset
space X′ = {cD′ |c ∈ C}. In the left action of C on X, a point stabilizer (of the point
                        −1
gD) has the form Dg , and in the left action of C on X′ , the stabilizer of hD′ is
   h−1
D′ . In particular, D is the stabilizer of the point (id·)D and D′ is the stabilizer
                                                                −1
of the point (id·)D′ . Now by EC, any a ∈ D′ is in some Dl , so that a fixes the
point lD.
P RINCIPLE 4.12. EC precisely expresses the geometric property we used in the model
example of projective general linear groups to solve the necessary equations for obtain-
ing EC.                                                                               ∇

Now we return to the setting of §§4.8, and let S, L, L′ , G, H, H ′ , γ, etc. be as before.
We need to solve equation set (34).
By induction on the decomposition cycles of the permutation γ, it suffices to con-
sider only regular n-cycles, although our method also applies to non-regular per-
mutations. So from now on, let γ be a regular n-cycle. As a1 , . . . , an ∈ S ′ , the
(composition) product (acting on the left)
                                    n
                                    Y
(35)                                      aγ −(n−i) (1) =: a
                                    i=1
is also in S ′ , and so fixes some point y of the left coset space {sL|s ∈ S} by EC. For
each i = 1, . . . , n, we define
(36)                                   ai (yi ) =: yγ −1 (i) ,
and note that yn = y (and γ 0 = id). We stress the fact that all considered points
are elements of the space {sL | s ∈ S}. Put x equal to the point (id) · L, so that L
is the point stabilizer of x in S acting on {sL | s ∈ S}.

Remark 4.13. Note that there could be i such that yi = yi+1 . This phenomenon
gives no obstructions. (And this is why the argument works for any type of permu-
tation.)

Now for each i = 1, . . . , n, define li as being any element of S which sends x
to yl (and note that such elements exist since S acts transitively on the points of
{sL|s ∈ S}).


                                 an                     aγ −1 (n)

                                        lγ −1 (n)

                           ln                                       lγ −2 (1)


                                                x


4.10. General case — definition of D: “Type I triples”. We are now ready to
define the class D. Elements of D are constructed through the following data:
(37)                                 E = (S, L, L′ , n, T )
where
       • (S, L, L′ ) is an EC-triple with FF (we call (S, L, L′ ) the base of E),
       • n ∈ N× is a positive integer, and
       • T is any transitive subgroup of the symmetric group Sn acting naturally on
         {1, . . . , n}.
We construct the EC-triple (S ≀ T, L ≀ T, L′ ≀ T ) as above, which we also denote by
(E(S), E(L), E(L′ )). Note that |S ≀ T | = |S|n |T |, |L ≀ T | = |L|n |T | and |L′ ≀ T | =
|L′ |n |T |.

If L and L′ are not conjugate (in particular L 6= L′ ), then L ≀ T and L′ ≀ T also
are no conjugate. For, suppose the latter are conjugate: (L ≀ T )g = L′ ≀ T with
g ∈ S ≀ T . Then as (L ≀ T ) ∩ S n = Ln (where as usual we write Ln for Ln × {id},
                           n
etc.), (L′ ≀ T ) ∩ S n = L′ and S n ✂ S ≀ T , we have
           g                                                                            n
(38) (Ln ) = ((L ≀ T ) ∩ Sn )g = (L ≀ T )g ∩ Sng = (L ≀ T )g ∩ Sn = (L′ ≀ T ) ∩ Sn = L′ .
Now with g = (u, γ), we obtain that
               g                 g                                              n
(39)      (Ln ) = (Ln × {id}) = (γ −1 (u−1 Ln u)) × {id} = (L′ ) × {id},
and it easily follows that L and L′ are also conjugate in S.


Remark 4.14 (Transitive groups). Any group acts transitively on some set: for
instance, let it act on the left on itself, and one obtains a sharply transitive action.

Remark 4.15 (Finiteness versus infinite). For physical means, one requires that the
groups be finite, but everything works fine for infinite groups as well.


4.11. Generic properties. As we have seen, several of the “naive” product con-
structions generate examples which lose fundamental properties of the initial base
example, such as FF or MAX. We will show that our construction preserves them.
This is most important for the physical viewpoint.


Theorem 4.16 (Conservation of Properties). Let E = (S, L, L′ , n, T ) be an element
of D, and suppose (S, L, L′ ) is MAX. Then (E(S), E(L), E(L′ )) is an EC-triple which is
FF, and also MAX.

Proof. We first prove FF. Suppose by way of contradiction that N is a normal
subgroup of E(S) which is contained in E(L). Then N ∩ S ×n (where we write S ×n
for S ×n ⋊{id}) is a normal subgroup of S ×n (as S ×n is a normal subgroup in E(S)).
Since N is contained in E(L), it follows that N ∩ S ×n = N ∩ L×n ≤ L×n . For, an
element of N ∩ S ×n is of the form (s, id) with s ∈ S ×n , and as N ≤ L×n ⋊ T , each
element of N has the form (l, t) with l ∈ L×n , t ∈ T . So the elements in N ∩ S ×n
are precisely the elements in N ∩ L×n . By Principle 4.5, we conclude that N ∩ L×n
                                                        ×n
must be trivial (if (S, L, L′ ) has FF, (S ×n , L×n , L′ ) must have FF). Now let (n, γ)
be in N ≤ E(L); as T ≤ E(L), we have (n, id) ∈ E(L), which implies it to be an
element of L×n . This is only possible if n = id. So N ≤ T . Finally, let (id, β) be any
element of N ; then with (r, α) an arbitrary element of E(S), we must have that
(40)                      (id, β)(r,α) = (α−1 (r−1 β(r)), β α )
is an element of N . So α−1 (r−1 β(r)) = id, implying that β(r) = r for all r ∈ S ×n .
It follows that N is trivial, and that (E(S), E(L), E(L′ )) has FF (since the same ar-
gument works for E(L′ )).

We now turn to MAX. Suppose E(L) is not a maximal subgroup of E(S), and let M
be a proper subgroup of E(S) that properly contains E(L). Note that T is contained
in M (up to a natural isomorphism t ∈ T 7→ (id, t)). Let (m, β) ∈ M \ E(L). As
(id, β −1 ) ∈ M , it follows that (m, id) 6∈ L×n , so with m = (m1 , . . . , mn ), some
mi is not in Li ∼  = L (= the ith copy of L in the Cartesian product L×n ). So if
                  ∼
πi : M −→ Si = S is the projection of M onto the ith copy of S in the product
S ×n , we have that πi (M ) properly contains Li , so that it must coincide with Si
as Li is maximal in Si by assumption. Now L×n ⋊ {id} ≤ M , and if M is the
projection of M onto S ×n ⋊ {id}, then L×n ⋊ {id} 6= M . Consider the subgroup
L × {id} × · · · × {id} of M . As π1 (M ) = S1 = S, we have that
(41)          h(L × {id} × · · · × {id})M i = hLS i × {id} × · · · × {id}.

But L is maximal in S, so either hLS i = L, and then L is a normal subgroup of S,
or hLS i = S. First suppose that we are in the latter case (for both the properties
AC/EC), so that S × {id} × · · ·× {id} ≤ M . As T acts transitively on the components
in S ×n , and as T is contained in M , it follows that M coincides with E(S). The
same argument works for E(L′ ), so we have indeed proved that MAX is inherited.

Now let L ✂ S. If (S, L, L′ ) is supposed to be AC, it follows as before that L = L′ ,
contradiction. If (S, L, L′ ) is EC, as before it follows that L′ ≤ L. On the other
hand, as L′ is also supposed to be maximal in S, we must have L = L′ , contradic-
tion.                                                                              



4.12. Examples of unbounded index. Since for all m ∈ N× we can find sharply
transitive permutation groups (T, X) with |T | = |M | = m (e.g., T is cyclic of order
m acting on itself by translation), we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.17 (Unbounded index). For each N ∈ N, there exist EC-triples (G, U, V )
with MAX and FF, such that
                                    |G|    |G|
(42)                                     =      > N.
                                    |U |   |V |

Proof. Follows immediately from the expressions of the sizes of the EC-triples
(S ≀ T, L ≀ T, L′ ≀ T ) with (S, L, L′ , n, T ) in D (by suitably adapting n in function
of N ), and the remark preceding the theorem.                                          



4.13. Variation on the construction in §§4.10: “Type II triples”. There is a sec-
                        e which we describe below. It is important to note that S
ond class of examples, D,
will be a simple group by assumption.

(43)                               E = (S, L, L′ , n, T )
where

       • S is a simple group,
       • n ∈ N× is a positive integer,
       • L and L′ are diagonal subgroups of S n ,
       • (S n , L, L′ ) is an EC-triple (again called the base of E), and
       • T is any transitive subgroup of the symmetric group Sn acting naturally on
         {1, . . . , n}, and both L, L′ are stabilized by T in its natural action on S n .

We construct the triple (S ≀ T, L ⋊ T, L′ ⋊ T ) as above, which we also denote by
(E(S), E(L), E(L′ )). Note that in this construction, |S≀T | = |S|n |T |, |L⋊T | = |L|·|T |
and |L′ ⋊ T | = |L′ | · |T |.

The fact that (E(S), E(L), E(L′ )) is EC can be obtained as before.

Again, one can verify MAX and FF for these examples (note that for MAX, one does
not have to assume MAX for (S, L, L′ )). We will quickly browse through the proofs,
which are a bit different than for the original construction (due, a.o., to the fact
that S is simple).

  MAX. One can derive MAX from O’Nan Scott theory (cf. the appendix of this
paper), but we will describe the idea for the sake of the reader. Without loss of
generality, suppose
(44)                             L := {(s, s, . . . , s)|s ∈ S},
                n
and denote S by N . Suppose by way of contradiction that M properly contains
L⋊T , M 6= N ⋊T . Then L 6= M ∩N 6= N . Let R ≥ M ∩N be maximal in N . Before
proceeding, recall that a group C is maximal in a direct product Dr (of r copies of
                                                                        −1
D, r ≥ 2), if either it is a normal subgroup of prime index, or C = πi,j   (E), where
                                                         r
E is maximal in Di × Dj , and πi,j is the projection of D on the i-th and j-th com-
ponent in Dr . We call a maximal subgroup of Dr standard if it is a direct product
of a maximal subgroup in D with r − 1 copies of D. If R is a normal subgroup of
prime index in N , then R does not contain some Si (seen as a subgroup of N ), so
R∼ = S m−1 × (Si ∩ R). By the transitive action of M on the components, it follows
                                                         −1
that R = N . If R is not normal of prime index, R = πi,j    (M ′ ) for some maximal
subgroup M ′ in Si × Sj . If m ≥ 3, then R ∼    = S m−2 × M ′ , and the transitivity
argument of above leads to R = N = M ∩ N , and hence M = S n ⋊ T . If m = 2,
then we use the fact that a group F is simple if and only if the diagonal group is
maximal in F × F , to conclude that L is already maximal in S × S = N , so that
M ∩ N = N , and hence M = S n ⋊ T .


  FF. Suppose K is a normal subgroup of N ⋊ T which is a subgroup of L ⋊ T .
First suppose that (k, id) ∈ K (with k = (e, e, . . . , e) ∈ Ln ). Then for any (v, id) in
N ⋊T , v = (v1 , . . . , vn ), we have that (k, id)(v,id) = (ev1 , . . . , evn , id) ∈ K ≤ L⋊{id}.
This is obviously not possible: take, for instance, v1 = id and v2 6∈ CS (e) (which is
possible as S is simple). (For n = 1, there is nothing to prove by assumption.)

It follows that K ∩ (L ⋊ {id}) = {id}. Now let (k, γ) ∈ K (with k = (e, e, . . . , e) ∈ L
and γ 6= id). Then for any (v, id) in N ⋊ T , v = (v1 , . . . , vn ), we have that
ϕ := (k, γ)(v,id) = (v −1 kγ(v), γ). Let v := (s, id, . . . , id). If n ≥ 3, then at least
on entry of ϕ is simply e, while the others have the form s−1 es, s−1 e, es or e, and
not only the latter form occurs. If an entry has the form s−1 es, let again s 6∈ CS (e);
if the entry has the form s−1 e or es, then let s 6= id. It follows that we can find v
such that (k, γ)(v,id) is not in K, that is, such that K is not a normal subgroup of
N ⋊ T inside L ⋊ T .

We have shown that FF holds (as the same works for L′ ).

|S|l |T |.

The fact that (E(S), E(L), E(L′ )) is EC can again be obtained as before.

Remark 4.20. Note that we suppose that L and L′ are diagonal copies of S in
groups isomorphic to S k . After applying the appropriate isomorphisms, we can then
indeed without loss of generality formulate the next property for D      b as “(S k , L, L′ ) is
an EC-triple with FF” (not having changed the notation for L and L′ for the sake of
convenience). In exactly the same vein, after considering the last defining property
for Db (namely, the one concerning the action of T ), L and L′ could be defined as
diagonal copies of S inside respectively Su1 × · · · × Suk and Su′1 × · · · × Su′k , where
{u1 , . . . , uk } and {u′1 , . . . , u′k } are members of the same block system described

                    5. C LASSIFYING PLANAR ISOSPECTRAL DRUMS

Let (G, U, V ) be a (finite) EC-triple with MAX and FF.
We will determine the structure of such an example, imposing more properties on
the way which are satisfied for any pair of transplantable planar isospectral drums.
Eventually, we will observe that finite (almost) simple groups yield the right triples.
To some point, we will follow some standard steps in the proof of the O’Nan-Scott
Theorem (cf. the appendix). But especially the physical constraints will eventually
shape the classification (in §§5.3 and §§5.4).

We will use the following fact throughout (see the appendix).

FACT. If X is a maximal subgroup of Y and the action of Y by left multiplication on
the left cosets of X is faithful, then for a hypothetical nontrivial normal subgroup Z
of Y , we have that Y = XZ. In other words, Z acts transitively on {lX | l ∈ Y }.


5.1. Case I: G is simple. If G is simple, we are in a special case of our construction,
Type I, namely the case with data E = (G = S, U = L, V = L′ , 1, {id}).
Note that all the known examples of isospectral pairs fall under Case 1 (in each
of these examples, G ∼
                     = PSLℓ (q) for small values of ℓ and q, and these groups are
simple).

5.2. Case II: G is not simple — first case. As U is maximal, G acts primitively
on the left cosets of U by left multiplication (and the same can be said about V ).
The fact that G is not simple implies that there are nontrivial minimal normal
subgroups. But, there are at most two (cf. the appendix), and detailed information
is known about them. First we suppose there is only one minimal normal subgroup
N , and that it is not abelian. The fact that there is one and only one nontrivial
minimal normal subgroup implies that the action of G on the left coset space G/U
is not sharply transitive (cf. the appendix), that is, U ∩ N 6= {id}.
By Appendix 7, N is (isomorphic to) a direct product of (m) copies of the same
nonabelian simple group, say S. Now G acts by conjugation as an automorphism
group on N .
   First put m = 1, so that N = S is simple. Then G is an almost simple group
(by definition), since S ≤ G ≤ Aut(S). So this falls under the data E = (G =
S, U = L, V = L′ , 1, {id}) for the Type I construction.

  Now let m ≥ 2. Write N as
(46)                           N = S1 × · · · × Sm ,
              ∼
where each Si = S is simple, and let S = {S1 , . . . , Sm }.
First note that as G = U N = V N , it follows that
(47)                G/N = U N/N ∼   = U/(U ∩ N ) ∼ = V /(V ∩ N ),
that is, U and V act in the same way on S as G does (they “contain” the complete
G-action). By Appendix 7, the action is transitive.
24                                             KOEN THAS


By O’Nan-Scott theory (see for instance the excellent lecture notes [33] for more
details besides those in the appendix), there are two cases (with some subdivision)
to consider (for both U and V — we only state them for U ):
       A The natural maps πi : U 7→ Si are not surjective. This implies that U ∩N =
         M1 × · · ·× Mm , where each Mi ∼          = M is a maximal subgroup in S. It follows
         that |U ∩ N | = |M |m .
       B The natural maps πi : U 7→ Si are surjective. There are two subcases.
          B.1 U ∩N is a diagonal copy diag(S) of S in N . In particular, |U ∩N | = |S|.
          B.2 U acts on {1, . . . , m} through blocks {u1 , . . . , uk| }U , where χ(U ) :=
               {u1 , . . . , uk } ⊂ {1, . . . , m}, and k divides m, and U ∩ (Su1 × · · · × Suk )
               is a diagonal copy diag(S) of S. (So in this case, χ(U ) is a block in
               a system of blocks for the action of G on {1, . . . , m}.) In particular,
               |U ∩ N | = |S|m/k .
If we are in (A), then U ∼
                         = M ≀ T , where T is isomorphic to the subgroup of Sm
which is induced on S by G, and also U . Also, G ∼
                                                 = S ≀ T = N ⋊ T.

                      = diag(S) ⋊ T , with T as above. Also, G ∼
If we are in (B.1), U ∼                                        = S ≀ T = N ⋊ T.

If we are in (B.2), U ∼
                      = diag(S)m/k ⋊ T , and also, G ∼
                                                     = S ≀ T = N ⋊ T . It should be
noted that diag(S) ≤ N .

Before finishing this part of the classification, we need the following result. First
note that in (A), (B.1) and (B.2), (G, U, V ) already has the form as in the Type I,
II, III triples (respectively) defined before. In the same way as for these triples, we
introduce the “base triple.”
Theorem 5.1. Let (G, U, V ) be EC. Let (A, B, C) be the base triple in each of (A),
(B.1), (B.2).
     (1) We have that (A, B, C) is EC.
     (2) If U and V are not conjugate, then B and C are not conjugate.
     (3) If |U | = |V |, then |A| = |B|, and hence U and V both are constructed through
         the same process (A), (B.1) or (B.2).
         In particular, if PAIR is satisfied, the same conclusion holds.

Proof. (1)      Take any (u, t) ∈ U ; then by EC there is a (n, r) ∈ G and (v, t′ ) ∈ V
such that
(48)                                    (u, t)(n,r) = (v, t′ ).
In particular, the formula holds when t = id, t′ = id, and we then have
(49)                     (u, id)(n,r) = (r−1 (n−1 un), id) = (v, id).
So for all u = ((b1 , . . . , bm ), id) in U (each bi taken in B), there is some (n, id) =
((a1 , . . . , am ), r) in G (each ai taken in A) and (v, id) = ((c1 , . . . , cm ), id) in V (each
ci taken in C), such that
(50)                     ((ba1 1 , . . . , bamm ), id) = (r(c1 , . . . , cm ), id).
The element (r(c1 , . . . , cm ), id) is an element of V , as V also contains the G-action.
The EC-property easily follows for (A, B, C) in each of the cases (A), (B.1) and
                              ISOSPECTRAL DRUMS AND SIMPLE GROUPS                       25


(B.2).

(2) Was obtained before.

(3) Follows immediately.                                                                

Remark 5.2. Consider the triple (G, U, V ) in B.2 (so both (G, U ) and (G, V ) are
assumed to fall under B.2). Then (G, U ) = (S ≀ T, U ∼     = S l ⋊ T ) and (G, V ) =
(S ≀ T, V ∼
          =  S l
                 ⋊ T ). Also, G acts on N , and on S = {S 1 , . . . , Sm } by conjugation,
and T also does. Besides that, T preserves the block systems of U and V . If u ∈ U ,
there is some g ∈ G and v ∈ V such that ug = v by EC, so it follows that U and V
live in the same block system. So we are indeed dealing with Type III triples (that
is, not only (G, U ) and (G, V ) have the desired form, but (G, U, V ) as well, as it
should have).

From this point on, the physical properties (FF and INV) will be the deciding factors
in the classification.

5.3. Case III: G is not simple — second case. Now suppose G has precisely two
minimal normal subgroups N and N ′ ; then by Appendix 7, N = CH (N ′ ), N ′ =
CH (N ), N ∩N ′ and N ∩N ′ = {id}, so that M := N ×N ′ is a normal (characteristic)
subgroup of G. Both N and N ′ act sharply transitively on the left cosets of U and
V , so that U ∩ N = U ∩ N ′ = V ∩ N = V ∩ N ′ = {id}, and
(51)                          G = U N = U N ′ = V N = V N ′.

In particular, |U | = |V |.

By INV, there is an involution γ in G which has more than |X|/3 fixed points in X.
If x and y are any two of these fixed points, and n ∈ N is such that xn = y, then as
N acts sharply transitively on X and as it is a normal subgroup of G, it follows that
n and γ commute (as the commutator [n, γ] fixes y and is contained in N ). So
                                                    |X|   |N |
(52)                          Fix(γ) = |CN (γ)| >       =      .
                                                     3     3
So only the possibilities |N |/2 and |N | come out for |CN (γ)|. If N = CN (γ), it
follows that γ fixes all points of X, a property which violates FF (and also INV).
Now turn to the case |CN (γ)| = |N |/2. By Appendix 7, N is (isomorphic to) a direct
product of (m) copies of the same nonabelian simple group, S. Write
(53)                           N∼ = S1 × · · · × Sm ,
each Sj being isomorphic to S.
Some S-factor Se of N is not contained in CN (γ) (as otherwise N = CN (γ)), and
then Se ∩ CN (γ) is a subgroup of index 2 in S.
                                             e So if |S| > 2, Se ∩ CN (γ) is a nontrivial
                        e
normal subgroup of S, contradicting its simplicity. So |S| = 2, meaning that N is
elementary abelian, contradiction. (This is in fact Case IV — see §§5.4.)
             26                                       KOEN THAS


             5.4. Case IV: G is not simple — abelian case. Suppose N is abelian. In that
             case, N acts sharply transitively on the left coset spaces G/U and G/V , and N is
             elementary abelian (cf. the appendix to this paper):
             (54)                         N∼ = Cp × Cp × · · · × Cp ,
             where Cp is the cyclic group of prime order p, and where we have taken m copies
             on the right-hand side. So we can identify N as the translation group of the affine
             space AG(m, p) =: A, which is itself identified with, say, G/U . (So the elements
             of G/U correspond to the points of AG(m, p).) After this identification, G acts
             as a faithful automorphism group of A, and it is isomorphic to a subgroup of
             AGLm+1 (p).
             We will now invoke INV to solve the last piece of the puzzle. As INV assumes
             an identity involving three involutions which are contained in G, we need extra
             knowledge of how involutions act on affine spaces. So we will discuss the different
             types of involutions that can occur in the automorphism group of a finite projective
             space PG(n, q), cf. [23]. The reader can deduct the different types of involutions
             for affine spaces from this result.
  Baer involutions A Baer involution is an involution which is not contained in the linear au-
                    tomorphism group of the space, so that q is a square, and it fixes an n-
                    dimensional subspace over F√q pointwise.
Even characteristic If q is even, and θ is an involution which is not of Baer type, θ must fix an
                    m-dimensional subspace of PG(n, q) pointwise, with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2m + 1.
                    In fact, to avoid trivialities, one assumes that m ≤ n − 1.
Odd characteristic If θ is a linear involution of PG(n, q), q odd, the set of fixed points is the
                    union of two disjoint complementary subspaces. Denote these by PG(k, q)
                    and PG(n − k − 1, q), k ≥ n − k − 1 > −1.
 Other involutions Those without fixed points.
             The argument below can now to some extent be taken from the combined work of
             Giraud [7] and the author [26, 27, 28].
             By INV we want to consider triples (A, {θ(i) }, r), where A is our affine space of
             dimension m ≥ 2 over Fp , and {θ(i) } a set of r nontrivial involutory automorphisms
             of A, satisfying
                                             X r
             (55)                  r(|A|) −       Fix(θ(j) ) = 2(|A| − 1),
                                                j=1

             for some natural number r ≥ 3. So we consider
                                                      Xr
             (56)                     (r − 2)pm + 2 =     Fix(θ(j) ).
                                                            j=1

             As p is a prime, Baer involutions do not occur. Since an automorphic involution
             fixes at most pm−1 + 1 points of A, we have r = 3. It is also clear that p ≤ 3.
             For p = 3, the only solution is {Fix(θ(1) ), Fix(θ(2) ), Fix(θ(3) )} = {pm−1 + 1, pm−1 +
             1, pm−1 } = {3m−1 + 1, 3m−1 + 1, 3m−1 }. Without loss of generality, we suppose
             θ(1) =: θ has 3m−1 + 1 fixed points in A, so that θ fixes an affine subspace Aθ of
             dimension m − 1 pointwise, and one additional affine point z. Let ∆ be the hyper-
             plane at infinity of A. Below, if α ⊆ A is an affine subspace of A, by α we denote
                          ISOSPECTRAL DRUMS AND SIMPLE GROUPS                        27


the projective completion of α, which is a projective subspace of A. Also, if β is an
automorphism of A (i.e., an element of AGLm+1 (p)), then β is the corresponding
automorphism of A. First suppose m ≥ 2, and let y be any point of A contained
in ∆, but not contained in the projective completion of Aθ . Then in the projective
completion of A, we have that zy ∩ Aθ = {y ′ } is a point which is not in ∆. As θ
fixes z and y ′ but not y, it follows that ∆ cannot be fixed by θ, contradiction by
the definition of θ. It follows that m = 1. In that case, each θ(i) fixes precisely one
point of A, and whence this case cannot occur.

Now let p = 2. Then
                                          r
                                          X
(57)                           2m + 2 =         Fix(θ(j) ).
                                          j=1

As the left-hand side is divisible by 2 but not by 4, some θ(i) must fix precisely two
points of A (we are working in even characteristic!). So (m − 1)/2 ≤ 1, and hence
m ≤ 3. If m = 1, it is easily seen that there are no solutions of the INV-equation. If
m ∈ {2, 3}, the only numerical solution is given by {2, 2m−1 , 2m−1 }.

All AC-triples with these numerical properties are known — see e.g. [18]. We have
not performed a more detailed analysis to find EC-triples with these data.


5.5. On AC-triples and planar examples. One expects triples (G, U, V ) that yield
elusive (counter) R2 -examples to fall inside classes I, II — first case, III or IV; in
class II — second case (so with m ≥ 2), a similar analysis as in the affine case
after invoking INV might lead to a very restrictive list (read: empty) of arithmetic
possibilities. If that were true, one would have that an AC-triple (G, U, V ) with
MAX, FF, PAIR and INV (that is, an irreducible Gassman-Sunada triple which yields
planar isospectral non-isometric billliards) is of only two types:
PLAN-1 of “almost simple type,”
PLAN-2 or known.
The author hopes to perform this analysis soon.

                                  6. C ONCLUSION

We started this paper with a detailed explanation of the connection between the
notions of “transplantability” and “almost conjugacy,” which are crucial in the con-
struction theory of planar isospectral billiards. We then discussed the related no-
tions AC-triple (or Gassman-Sunada triple) and EC-triple (which naturally general-
izes AC-triples), in the context of isospectral drumheads (in any dimension). Next,
we explored some “naive” constructions of EC-triples, starting from one given EC-
triple, through direct products and “adding kernels.” Then we introduced four
properties — being FF, MAX, PAIR, INV — inspired by physical properties which
“irreducible” drumheads should have on the one hand, and which planar examples
have, on the other.
We introduced an extremely general set of construction procedures of EC-triples
with FF and MAX (starting from a given one), which due to MAX, is connected
to the O’Nan-Scott Theorem of finite Group Theory, which involves finite simple
groups. The essential reason why the procedures work can be situated in properties
of underlying combinatorial point-line geometries which translate EC.
In a final stage, we classified EC-triples, by starting from EC-triples with FF, MAX,
PAIR and INV, and showed that, indeed, any such example is constructed through
one of our procedures. In particular, all the known planar counter examples to
Kac’s question “Can one hear the shape of a drum” arise.
In such a way, we have obtained a deep connection between irreducible (possibly
higher-dimensional) drumheads and finite simple groups that offers a new direction
in the theory.

                    7. A PPENDIX : T HE O’N AN -S COTT THEOREM

Let H ≤ Sym(Ω) be a finite primitive permutation group, let M be a minimal
normal subgroup of H, and let z ∈ Ω.
Below, soc(Y ), where Y is a group, denotes the socle of Y — the normal subgroup
generated by the minimal normal subgroups of Y . Also, hol(Y ) denotes the holo-
morph of Y — a group which is isomorphic to Y ⋊ Aut(Y ).
The O’Nan-Scott theorem distinguishes the following cases:


  (HA) M is elementary abelian and regular, CH (M ) = M , and H ≤ hol(M ); in
       this case M is the translation group of some finite affine space AG(l, p) (p
       a prime and l some positive integer), and H ≤ GLl (p).

  (HS) M is non-abelian, simple and regular, soc(H) = M × CH (M ) ∼
                                                                  = M × M,
       and H ≤ hol(M );

  (HC) M is non-abelian, non-simple and regular, soc(H) = M × CH (M ) ∼
                                                                      =
       M × M , and H ≤ hol(M );

  (SD) M is non-abelian and non-simple, Mz is a simple subdirect product of M
       and CH (M ) = {id};

  (CD) M is non-abelian and non-simple, Mz is a non-simple subdirect product of
       M and CH (M ) = {id};

  (PA) M is non-abelian and non-simple, Mz is not a subdirect subgroup of M
       and Mz 6= {id}; CH (M ) = {id};

  (AS) M is non-abelian and simple, CH (M ) = {id} and H is an almost simple
       group;

 (TW) M is non-abelian and non-simple, Mz = {id} and CH (M ) = {id}. Also,
      there is a (non-abelian) simple group T such that M = T × · · · × T (m
      factors) (and so |M | = |T |m ).



The theorem has a simple proof. Below, we list some fundamental lemmas which
are used to prove O’Nan-Scott, and which were frequently used in the body of this
paper. All of them can be found in [33].
Observation 7.1. Every normal subgroup of a primitive group is transitive.
Observation 7.2. If K is a characteristically simple group, then it is a direct product
of isomorphic simple groups. In particular, this applies to minimal normal subgroups
of any finite group.
Observation 7.3. If H is a primitive group, and N is a minimal normal subgroup of
H, then H = KN for any point stabilizer K.

Based on the previous observations, we consider the following, more transparent
form of O’Nan-Scott, which summarizes the previous version in four main classes.

Let H be primitive (in its action on the set X), and let N be a minimal normal
subgroup of H. Let x ∈ X, and let Hx be the stabilizer of x in H.
      I If any such N is trivial, H is simple.
If no such N is abelian, there are two cases to consider.
      II N is unique. If N is simple, H is almost simple. If N is not simple, N is a
         direct product of (r) mutually isomorphic simple groups ∼       = P , on which H
         acts transitively by conjugation. One distinguishes three cases: (a) Hx ∩
         N = W r ≤ P r is a direct product of (r) mutually isomorphic groups
         (W ≤ P ); (b) Hx ∩ N is a diagonal copy of P ; (c) there is a block system
         for H in its action on {P1 , . . . , Pr }, where N = P1 × · · · × Pr , and a block
         B such that (Hx ∩ N ) ∩ B is a diagonal copy of P . (Here, we see B as the
         subgroup of N naturally defined by its elements.)
     III N is not unique. In that case, there is a second minimal normal subgroup
         N ′ , and N ∩ N ′ = {id}, CH (N ) = N ′ , CH (N ′ ) = N , so that N × N ′ is a
         normal subgroup of H. Also, N and N ′ have the same properties as N in
         (II), and there is an outer automorphism of H which acts as an involution
         on {N, N ′ }. Finally, both N and N ′ have the same sharply transitive action
         on X.
Finally, there is the abelian case.
     IV If N is abelian, it is elementary abelian and sharply transitive on X, and H
        is an affine group.
