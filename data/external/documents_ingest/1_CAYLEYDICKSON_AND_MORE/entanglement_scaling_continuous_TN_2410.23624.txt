Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and
long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of
the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task
involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization
picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time
evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of
iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths
where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal
the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length
against the virtual bond dimension χ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two
scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but
were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge
c = 1, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of
three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at
the dividing point. Our work uncovers the scaling behaviors of EE in the continuous-space quantum many-body
systems. These results provide solid numerical evidence supporting the high efficiency of TN in representing
the continuous-space quantum many-body wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit, and meanwhile suggest
an efficient approach to study the entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Developing efficient approaches for simulating stronglycorrelated quantum systems is a long-standing topic of interest. A well-established treatment is lattice approximation that
leads to quantum lattice models such as Heisenberg and Hubbard models, where tensor network (TN) methods [1–4] have
been successfully adopted to reveal fruitful exotic phenomena such as quantum criticality and quantum topological orders [5–10]. The success of TN methods in simulating quantum lattice models is solidly supported by the scaling theories of entanglement entropy (EE) [11–17]. For instance, matrix product state (MPS) [18, 19] can faithfully represent the
states satisfying one-dimensional (1D) area law of EE, which
include the ground states of gapped 1D Hamiltonians with local couplings [12, 20, 21]. For 1D critical quantum lattice
models, the criticality (such as central charge) can be accurately accessed by the scaling behaviors of MPS [11–13, 17].
Without lattice approximation, the main challenge lies in
solving the many-body Schrödinger equations, which are
multi-variable partial differential equations (PDE’s). Analytical solutions are nearly infeasible. Numerical methods, such
as Monte Carlo [22–25] and neural-network schemes [26–
30], are severely hindered by the so-called “exponential wall”,
namely the complexity (say the dimension of sampling space)
scales exponentially with the system size. Meanwhile, theories and methods established for quantum lattice models, such
as EE and its scaling laws, can hardly be applied to the quan-

tum models in continuous space. These severely hinder the investigation of the realistic quantum systems such as the quantum materials with strong correlations.
In this work, we extend the TN-based imaginary-time evolution algorithms for quantum lattice models [31, 32] to the
simulation of continuous-space quantum many-body systems
by incorporating the continuous-space TN method [33, 34]

(see Fig. 1). We here adopt the translationally-invariant
MPS to solve the time-independent Schrödinger equation (in
the canonical quantization form) of infinitely-many coupled
quantum oscillators (iCQOs). This Schrödinger equation consists of a set of PDE’s with infinitely-many variables. No numerical results of solving these PDE’s were reported to our
best knowledge, due to the infinite number of variables involved. One may refer to Refs. [35–37] on solving PDE’s with
finite variables by MPS. The translationally-invariant MPS is
used to represent the infinitely-many coefficients of the wavefunction in a set of orthonormal functional bases.
By leveraging the advantages of canonical MPS [31] on efficiently simulating entanglement and correlations of quantum
many-body states, we investigate the criticality of iCQOs with
the presence of two- and three-body coupling terms. With
just the two-body terms, we determine the range of coupling
strength where there exists a physical ground-state solution
(i.e., real ground-state energy as the Hamiltonian is hermitian [38]), which we dub as physical region. At the dividing point between the physical and non-physical regions, we
uncover that the ground-state EE and correlation length satisfy the critical scaling laws (against the virtual dimension of
MPS), which were previously uncovered in the critical quantum lattice models [11, 13, 16, 39]. The scaling coefficients
result in a central charge c = 1 [40, 41], indicating that the
ground state of iCQOs can be described by free boson conformal field theory (CFT) [42]. With three-body couplings, we
show the breakdown of CFT even with very weak three-body
couplings. Our work explicitly shows the satisfaction of the
1D scaling laws of EE, which can serve as solid supports on
MPS as an efficient ansatz to represent the ground-state wavefunctions of continuous-space many-body systems, including
those in the thermodynamic limit.

II. IMAGINARY-TIME EVOLUTION FOR THE
GROUND-STATE SIMULATION OF INFINITELY-MANY
COUPLED QUANTUM OSCILLATORS

To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body systems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is a
normalized many-variable function denoted as ψ(x) with x =
(x1 , x2 , . . .), in a set of complete functional bases {ϕsn (xn )}.
A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which are exponentially many, in an MPS whose complexity scales just linearly
with the system size (i.e., number of variables) [33, 34]. The
infinite functional MPS is written as
Y

ψ(x) = tTr


, (1)

with tTr the summation of all shared indexes. We take
the Planck constant ℏ = 1 for simplicity. We here
choose the functional bases to be “local”, i.e., constructed
Rby∞ the∗ single-variable functions {ϕsn (xn )} that satisfy
ϕ (x)ϕs′ (x)dx = δss′ . The physical dimension (the
−∞ s

bond dimension of physical index sn , denoted as D) determines the order of expansion, namely dim(sn ) in {ϕsn (xn )}.
The virtual dimension (the dimension of virtual index an , denoted as χ) determines the number of expansion terms. Both
dimensions determine the parameter complexity of the MPS.
To efficiently represent the infinite-size wave-functions, we
take the MPS to be translationally invariant. Fig. 1 illustrates
the MPS satisfying the “two-tensor” translational invariance,
namely the MPS is formed by infinitely-many copies of two
inequivalent tensors A and B, as well as those of two inequivalent spectra (diagonal matrices) λI and λII [Fig. 1(a)]. The
spectra are necessary to define the canonical form of infinite
MPS for the purpose of optimal truncations and entanglement
simulations [31]. The number of variational parameters in
such an MPS scales approximately as O(Dχ2 ). In practice,
we adopt the “K-tensor” translational invariance. We take
K = 2 when there exist only the one- and two-body terms in
the Hamiltonian, and K = 6 with the presence of the threebody terms.
Translational invariance allows TN methods to efficiently
simulate infinite-size quantum many-body systems. For quantum lattice models, translational invariance explicitly corresponds to the translational invariance of the quantum states
with the respect to lattice sites, since the tensors are usually
in one-to-one correspondence with the sites. For continuousspace systems (such as iCQOs considered here), there is
no such correspondences. The translational invariance respects the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, and is not contradictory to the indistinguishability of particles. Thus, we regard translational invariance as a physically-reasonable conjecture imposed on the functional MPS ansatz. Note that the
Schrödinger equations we aim to solve are in the canonical
quantization picture, where the bosonic or fermionic statistics
of the wave-functions is not explicitly considered.
The Hamiltonian of iCQOs is written as
Ĥ =

−

1 X ∂2
( 2 − ω 2 x2n ) + γ
xn xn+1 ,
2 n=1 ∂xn

(2)

where we take the natural frequency ω = 1 for simplicity. The
time-independent Schrödinger equation reads Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩,
which is a set of PDE’s consisting of infinitely-many variables {xn }. The minimal eigenvalue (denoted as E0 ) gives
the ground-state energy, satisfying E0 = min|ψ⟩ ⟨ψ|Ĥ|ψ⟩ =
⟨ψ0 |Ĥ|ψ0 ⟩ with |ψ0 ⟩ denoting the ground state.
Given a set of orthonormal functional bases {ϕs (xn )}, the
operators (say ∂x∂n and xn ) can be represented as matrices
as ∂ˆn and X̂n ). Their
coefficients satisfy ∂ss′ =

(iTEBD) algorithm [31, 32] to simulate the ground state of
iCQOs. We may define the two-body imaginary-time evolution gate Ûn = e−τ Ĥn,n+1 with τ a small positive number called Trotter step. By iteratively implementing the

Eexact is real for γ <= γc ≡ 0.5, which we dub as the physical
region. Fig. 2 shows the error ε = |Eexact − ⟨ψ|Ĥ|ψ⟩| versus
the physical and virtual dimensions (D and χ). The error converges to ε ∼ O(10−5 ), indicating that the ground states can
be well approximated by the MPS’s with a finite D or χ.
The correlation length ξ and entanglement entropy (EE) S
of the ground state can be efficiently accessed by the MPS
method [4, 44]. The correlation length is obtained from the
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix M of the infinite MPS [see
the inset of Fig. 3(a) for the illustration of M ], satisfying
1
ξ = ln Λ0 −ln
Λ1 with Λ0 and Λ1 the two dominant eigenvalues of M . It naturally obeys the standard definition of
correlation length of continuous-space wave-functions, which
characterizes the decay of correlation function ⟨Ôn Ôn′ ⟩ versus |n − n′ |. The EE of continuous-space wave-functions is
much less investigated. Here, the canonical form of the infinite MPS gives us a well-defined entanglement spectrum. The
P I(II)
I(II)
EE can then be defined as S = −2 a (λa )2 ln λa . The
difference between the EE’s calculated from the two spectra
is about O(10−3 ), which is the result of numerical errors.
When γ is far away from the dividing point γ = 0.5, both
the correlation length ξ and EE S converge as χ increases
(Fig. 3). We fix D = 16, which should be sufficiently large.

FIG. 3. (Color online) (a) The correlation length ξ and (b) EE S
versus the virtual bond dimension χ. We vary the strength of the
two-body interaction from γ = 0.49 to 0.5 by fixing D = 16. The
correlation length is computed using the transfer matrix of the infinite MPS illustrated in the inset of (a). The inset of (b) shows the
convergence of central charge c → 1 against χmax (meaning the fitting is implemented with the data for χ ≤ χmax ). Fittings of ξ and S
are given by the dashed lines, which obey algebraic and logarithmic
scaling laws, respectively [see Eqs. (4) and (5)].

These results indicate the finiteness of correlation length and
EE for the ground state of iCQOs within the physical region,
which are typical signatures of a finite excitation gap. This
suggests that an infinite functional MPS with finite bond dimensions can well approximate such non-critical many-body
wave-functions.
As γ approaches the dividing point, both ξ and S become
asymptotically divergent (Fig. 3). At γ = 0.5, our results
suggest the algebraic scaling law of correlation length as
ξ ∼ χκ ,

(4)

and meanwhile the logarithmic scaling law of EE as
S ∼ η ln χ.

(5)

We have κ ≃ 1.32 and η ≃ 0.23. These two scaling laws
are recognized as signatures of criticality for quantum lattice
models [13], but haven’t been uncovered in the continuousspace systems such as iCQOs. Our work reveals that even
with divergent correlation length and EE, the continuousspace wave-functions can still be asymptotically approached
by MPS in a similar manner for approaching the critical quantum lattice systems.
The critical properties can be further characterized by the
scaling coefficients. From CFT, we can estimate the central
charge as
c=

This suggests the wave-function at the dividing point between
the physical and non-physical regions to be described by the
c = 1 boson CFT [42]. The inset of Fig. 3(b) demonstrates
the convergence of c versus χ.

energy is irregularly low with the violation L ∼ O(102 )
(which is far larger than the violation L ∼ O(10−1 ) in the
physical region). By fitting, we find the dividing boundary to
0.438
satisfy an algebraic relation γ̃ ∼ (0.5 − γ)
.
Fig. 5(a) shows that EE slightly increases when γ̃ approaches the dividing boundary from the physical side. The
dividing boundary given by the peak of EE is consistent with
that obtained in Fig. 4. We have γ̃ = 0.02 ± O(10−5 ) as the
dividing point for γ = 0.499, and γ̃ = 0.035 ± O(10−5 ) for
γ = 0.495. On the dividing boundary, our results show that
EE no longer obeys the logarithmic scaling law but converges
after χ ≃ 25 for γ = 0.499 (or after χ ≃ 15 for γ = 0.495).
See Fig. 5(b). EE does not scale to diverge as χ increases,
and thus implies the absence of criticality or the CFT description for the ground-state wave-functions when the three-body
terms appear.

we reveal algebraic scaling laws of the correlation length and
logarithmic scaling laws of the entanglement entropy (EE)
against the virtual dimension of the TN ansatz. These findings
suggest the c = 1 boson conformal field theory (CFT) describing the criticality at the dividing point. We further show that
the three-body terms break down the criticality and the CFT
description on the dividing boundary. Our work demonstrates
the validity of EE scaling theories based on TN for investigating the quantum many-body systems in continuous space.
The satisfactions of EE scaling laws serves as a solid evidence
on the efficiency of TN for approximating continuous-space
wave-functions and for accessing the properties of criticality
of continuous-space quantum many-body systems.

SUMMARY

This work concerns simulating the ground-state wavefunctions and their entanglement properties of infinite-size
quantum many-body systems in continuous space. We combine the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm
with functional tensor network (TN) to simulate the ground
states of infinite coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs) defined
in continuous space. At the dividing point between the physical and non-physical regions with just two-body couplings,

The data that support the findings of this work are available

To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body systems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is

{ϕsn (xn )}. A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which
are exponentially many, in a tensor network (TN) whose complexity scales just polynomially with the system size [33, 34].

The indexes αn (n = 1, · · · , N − 1) are dubbed as virtual bonds. The upper bound of their dimensions dim(αn )
is called the virtual bond dimension, denoted by χ. The indexes {sn } are called the physical bonds, with their dimensions called the physical bond dimension , denoted by D. In
our cases for representing continuous-space wave-functions,
D determines the expansion order in the functional bases. The
number of parameters in the MPS (i.e., the total number of elements in the tensors {A(n) } for n = 1, · · · , N ) scales only
linearly with N as O(N Dχ2 ), while the number of coefficients in ψ(x) scales exponentially as O(DN ).
The MPS is formed by infinite copies of four inequivalent
tensors, which are third-order tensors A, B, and vectors (or
diagonal matrices) λI , λII . Such an MPS is called two-site
or two-tensor (considering A and B are defined on the sites)

still take the simulation without three-body terms (γ̃ = 0) as
an example to explain the algorithm.

Appendix C: Infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm

The ground state of a given Hamiltonian can be simulated
using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)
algorithm [32]. We start from the definition of the timeevolution operator
Y
Û (τ ) =
e−τ Ĥn,n+1 ,
(C1)
n

with Us0 s1 p0 p1 = ⟨s0 s1 |Û |p0 p1 ⟩. See Fig. 1(b).
To restore the MPS form before contraction, we perform
SVD on T as
T [0,1],[2,3] = W λII V †

(C4)

with T [0,1],[2,3] being the matrization of T by reshaping its
first two indexes into one index and the rest two indices into
another. See the first line of Fig. 1(b). The spectrum λII is
updated by the singular spectrum obtained in the above SVD.

Appendix E: Simulation of local fidelity

FIG. 7. (Color online) The canonical conditions of MPS. See
Eq. (D1) for the contraction formula corresponding to the left panel.

Obviously, the new indexes obtained by SVD and the new
spectrum λII possess a larger dimension. Without any truncation, the dimension will increase exponentially with the evolution time. What we do in the iTEBD algorithm is if this
dimension exceeds the preset maximum (denoted as χ), it
should be truncated to χ by keeping only the χ-largest singular values and the corresponding singular vectors.

Fig. 8 shows the convergence with the MPS’s of different translational symmetries. We consider the K-tensor
translationally invariant MPS’s with K = 2, 3, 4, 6 and

FIG. 8. (Color online) Local fidelity F from the fidelity f =
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K ′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2 versus the evolution step n
with different translational invariances (K = 2, 3, 4, 6). F is calculated as the norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer
matrix of f (see Fig. 9 for the definition of transfer matrix).

Finally, one restores the spectra located at the two sides by
inserting λI (λI )−1 , as shown in the last line of Fig. 1(b). The
two third-order tensors are obtained as
∗
I −1
Aαsβ = (λI )−1
αα Wαsβ , Bαsβ = Vαsβ (λ )ββ .

|⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K ′ = 3, n′ )⟩|. We have ignored to illustrate the
transpose conjugation of the tensors for simplicity.

Appendix D: Canonical form of matrix product state

With τ → 0, the evolution given by Û (τ ) is close to be
identical. Therefore, the evolution drives the MPS to the
so-called canonical form [31], where the tensors satisfy the
canonical conditions illustrated in Fig. 7. As an example, the
contraction given by the left panel reads
X
Bβ∗0 s0 α0 Bβ0′ s0 α′0 λIIα0 α0
s0 s1 α0 α′0 α1 α′1

λIIα′0 α′0 A∗α0 s1 β1 Aα′0 s1 β1 (λIβ1 β1 )2 = Iβ0 β0′ ,

(D1)

with I representing the identity. The canonical conditions can
be generalized to the cases with K-tensor translational invariance.
We here utilize two advantages of the MPS being in the
canonical form. First, the truncations implemented in the
iTEBD algorithm are (nearly) optimal. By “nearly”, we mean
that the MPS approaches (but is not in) the strict canonical
form in the nearly-identical evolution given by Û (τ ). Second, it has been proven that the spectra (λI and λII ) give the
entanglement spectra for the bipartitions at the corresponding
positions. These two advantages hold not only for MPS representing the quantum many-body states of lattice models, but
also the functional MPS’s that represent the wave-functions in
the continuous space as well as for the functional MPS’s with
K-tensor translational invariance.

show the “local” fidelity F that can give the fidelity f =
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K ′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2 versus the number of
evolution steps n. Note |ψ(K, n)⟩ denotes a K-tensor translationally invariant MPS after n evolution steps.
The local fidelity is calculated by the largest eigenvalue of
the transfer matrix of |⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K ′ , n′ )⟩|. See Fig. 9 as the
illustration of the transfer matrix with K = 2 and K ′ = 3 as
an example. One should take K̃ = 6 tensors from each of the
matrix to define the transfer matrix, with K̃ the least common
multiple of K and K ′ . The local fidelity is calculated as the
norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.
Specifically, we have
N

f = F K̃ ,

(E1)

with the system size N → ∞ in the thermodynamic limit.
One always has f → 0 when the difference between the local tensors of two MPS’s lead the dominant eigenvalue to be
smaller than 1. Therefore, we choose the local fidelity F to
characterize the similarity between two infinite-size MPS’s
rather than the fidelity f .
In Fig. 8(a), we take γ = 0.49 and γ̃ = 0, where the Hamiltonian consists of just two-body couplings. All local fidelities
converge to 1, meaning the MPS’s stably converge to |ψ(K =
6, n = 1000)⟩. In Fig. 8(b), we introduce the three-body couplings by taking γ̃ = 0.03. The MPS with 6-tensor translational invariance converges well as n increases. However, the
fidelity F = |⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K ′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2 converges to about 0.1. This is due to the inconsistency between
the translational invariance (K = 2) and the 3-body coupling
terns. Therefore, we trust the results with K = 6.
