I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and
√
oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sNN = 5.36 TeV, assuming no final-state
interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with stateof-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the
h
nuclear modification factor RAA
in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical
uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below 20 GeV. In
the intermediate range 20 GeV ≲ phT ≲ 70 GeV, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to
approximately 5%. At higher momenta (phT ≳ 70 GeV), however, predictions exhibit a marked
spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about
isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral
pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.

INTRODUCTION

Collisions of ultra-relativistic heavy nuclei at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) provide a unique window into a novel
state of quantum matter, the Quark–Gluon Plasma
(QGP), composed of deconfined quark and gluon degrees of freedom [1]. A key signature of the formation
of QGP is the suppression of high-momentum hadron
and jet yields (jet quenching). This phenomenon is understood as energy loss of high-momentum partons, produced in initial hard scatterings, through multiple interactions with the medium, which leads to a depletion of
the observed high-momentum yield [2–4]. A major open
question in the field is understanding how different QGP
signals, such as jet quenching, evolve with the size of the
colliding system [5–7].
Strikingly, several signatures traditionally associated
with QGP formation, such as azimuthal anisotropies and
strangeness enhancement, have been observed even in
small systems, such as proton-proton, proton-nucleus,
and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [8–11]. However, an unambiguous signal of partonic energy loss has
not yet been established in systems with ≲ 30 participating nucleons. Centrality-selected peripheral heavyion collisions (e.g., PbPb at the LHC or AuAu at
RHIC) are complicated by significant uncertainties in
collision-geometry modelling as well as by centralityselection biases [12, 13]. Measurements in asymmetric
proton–nucleus collisions have so far provided only upper
limits on possible jet-quenching effects [14–16]. A notable
exception are recent PHENIX results in deuteron–gold
collisions, where a suppression of neutral pion production was observed in the highest event-activity class [17];
however, its interpretation in terms of a genuine finalstate effect remains under debate [18].
Collisions of light ions provide symmetric systems

with significant advantages and unique physics opportunities [19–21]. In particular, oxygen ion (168 O) collisions involve, on average, ∼ 10 participating nucleons, thus bridging the system size range between protonnucleus and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [22]. In
March 2021, RHIC conducted oxygen–oxygen collisions
√
at sNN = 200 GeV [23]. More recently, in July 2025, the
LHC carried out oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon collisions
√
at sNN = 5.36 TeV, as well as proton–oxygen collisions
√
at sNN = 9.62 TeV [24, 25]. A pressing open question
is whether unambiguous evidence of partonic energy loss
can be established in these small collision systems.
Selecting central oxygen-oxygen collisions enhances the
potential medium-induced energy loss signal. However,
such a selection introduces potential biases [26] and, importantly, prevents the construction of an accurate theoretical baseline. Only in minimum-bias collisions can
the inclusive high-momentum hadron and jet production
be reliably computed using QCD factorization. The standard observable of energy loss is the nuclear modification
factor RAA , which is the ratio of pT spectra in nucleusnucleus and proton-proton collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions [2–4]. In minimum-bias collisions
RAA can be written as a ratio of pT -differential cross
sections (for some rapidity window |y| < ymax ):
RAA ≡

where A = 16 is the nuclear mass number.
In this work, I compute the perturbative QCD baseline, i.e., the expectation in the absence of mediuminduced energy loss, for the nuclear modification fach

final-state effects indicative of QGP formation. Since
the expected energy-loss signal is small, it is essential
to quantify theoretical uncertainties in the baseline of
Eq. (1) with high accuracy. To this end, I perform
next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative QCD calculations using state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution
functions (nPDFs) and hadron fragmentation functions
(FFs). This work updates the previous baseline estimate of Ref. [27] with latests nPDFs, FFs and the actual
LHC centre-of-mass energy for oxygen–oxygen collisions.
h
Baseline estimates for charged hadron RAA
for RHIC energies can be found in Ref. [28]. Baseline computations
j
for inclusive jet RAA
and semi-inclusive jet- and hadrontriggered nuclear modification factors were recently presented in Ref. [29]. Although a statistically significant
deviation between the no-quenching baseline and experimental data would suffice to establish energy loss in oxygen–oxygen collisions, interpreting such a signal requires
dedicated model predictions. These have been developed
in the literature [30–37] and are not discussed in this paper.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, I
describe the computational framework and present a validation plot. Section III contains the baseline results for
the charged-hadron and neutral-pion nuclear modification factor RAA . For completeness, I also provide the
absolute cross-section predictions for proton–proton and
oxygen–oxygen collisions separately. The conclusions are
summarised in Section IV. Additional results for different rapidity selections are shown in Section A, while Section B discusses the role of isospin symmetry in fragmentation functions.

COMPUTATIONAL SETUP

A.

Inclusive hadron cross-section

According to QCD factorisation, the perturbative
single-inclusive hadronic cross section is given by the convolution of parton distribution functions, hard partonic
cross section and fragmentation functions [38, 39]
Eh

dσ AB→h
= fiA ⊗ fjB ⊗ σ̂ ij→l ⊗ Dlh .
d3 p h

(2)

Here fiA and fjB are parton distribution functions (PDFs)
for nucleus A and B and partons i and j at factorization scale µF . In this paper, I consider only symmetric
collision systems, i.e., A = B = p or A = B = 168 O.
σ̂ ij→l is the partonic cross-section ij → l, which is computed at leading (LO) and next-to-leading (NLO) order
at renormalization scale µR . Finally, Dlh is the parton l
fragmentation function (FF) into a hadron species h at
fragmentation scale µF F . I consider two cases: fragmentation to charged hadrons and fragmentation to neutral
pions, i.e., h = π 0 .

I evaluated Eq. (2) using INCNLO program [40]2 modified to use LHAPDF grids [41] for parton distribution
and fragmentation functions. Modifications were checked
against an independent LO implementation of the hadron
cross-section formula [27]. INCNLO computes the hadron
cross section differentially in transverse momentum pT ,
but averaged in the azimuth and rapidity |y| < ymax ,
i.e., dσ h /(2πpT dpT dy). The factorisation, renormalisation, and fragmentation scales are chosen to be equal to
hadron transverse momentum µF = µR = µF F = phT .
To estimate uncertainties from missing higher order
terms, I vary µF , µR and µF F by a factor 2 up and
down with a condition that no two scales are varied up
and down at the same time (15-point scale uncertainty
prescription). Although scale uncertainties do not have
probabilistic interpretation [42], the nested LO and NLO
scale uncertainties are conventionally used to assess the
perturbative convergence of the observable.
To estimate uncertainties from (nuclear) parton distribution functions, I use three sets of proton and oxygen PDFs: EPPS21 [43], which uses CT18ANLO [44]
as a proton PDF baseline, nNNPDF3.0 [45], which
is matched to NNPDF3.1 [46] proton PDF, and
TUJU21 [47], which simultaneously determines nucleus
and proton PDFs. All three nPDF determinations
include experimental data from measurements in pPb
collisions at the LHC: W ± and Z boson production
(TUJU21, EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); dijet and D-meson
data (EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); isolated photon measurements (nNNPDF3.0). Each nPDF extraction is accompanied by a large set of PDF variations, which can be
used to determine the confidence intervals for the computed cross section. For each PDF in an error set, I repeat the cross-section computation and use the built-in
LHAPDF functionality to compute 68% confidence intervals. Note that no data with oxygen nucleus is included
in the fits, and oxygen nPDFs are determined by interpolation in nuclear mass number A. Comparison between
different collaborations shows how robust this extraction
is with respect to changes in the input data, fitting techniques, and nPDF parametrisation.
To estimate uncertainties from the choice of fragmentation functions, I used three choices of fragmentation
functions: Binnewies-Kniehl-Kramer (BKK) [48] FFs,
which is a built-in option in INCNLO, NNFF1.1h[49]3 and
NPC23
√ [50] FFs. BKK fits charged pion and kaon FFs
to s = 29 GeV e+ e− annihilation data. The charged
hadron FFs are formed as a sum of charged pion and
kaon FFs. Pion contribution is increased by a factor 1.16
to mimic (anti)proton contribution. NNFF1.1h charged
hadron FFs are obtained from a direct fit to charged
hadron data from a large set of single-inclusive e+ e− an-

Validation

To validate numerical setup, I computed inclusive
√
hadron cross section in proton-proton collisions at s =
5.02 TeV, 6 GeV < phT < 50 GeV and |y| < 0.8 using
CT18ANLO PDF (central value) with BKK, NNFF1.1h
and NPC23 FFs (c.f. Ref. [53]). The results are shown in
Fig. 1 and compared to experimental measurements by
ALICE [52]. The pT -binned cross section was obtained
using a three-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature to evaluate the momentum integrals. Note that ALICE reports
the averaged hadron yield in pp collisions, which can be
converted to the cross section by scaling it with inelastic
pp cross section σNN = 67.3 ± 1.2 mb [13]. The black
bands and black error points correspond to experimental systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively
(uncertainty in σNN is neglected). The lower panel shows
the ratio to NLO BKK FF results.
The brown and red colour bands indicate the LO
and NLO scale uncertainties computed with CT18ANLO
PDFs and BKK FFs. The NLO band ranges from ∼ 10%
in the highest momentum bin to almost 50% in the lowest momentum bin. The NLO central value is within the

includes
√ LHC charged hadron data at centre of mass energies s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV. NPC23 performs global
analysis of a wide range of precision measurements from
the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions
and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. NPC23 in±

cludes both identified hadron (π
√ , K , p(p̄)) and charged
hadron data at LHC up to s = 13 TeV. Charged
hadron FFs are a sum of fitted charged pion, kaon, and
(anti)proton FFs. We also use neutral pion FFs constructed from NPC23 charged pion FFs using isospin
symmetry [51]4 . NNFF1.1h and NPC23 provide FF error
sets, which are used to compute 68% confidence intervals.
BKK FFs do not include uncertainty estimates, and only
scale uncertainties are shown.
In the ratio of cross sections Eq. (1), one can expect a
significant cancellation between common sources of theoretical uncertainties in proton and oxygen cross sections.
Therefore, the scale uncertainty of RAA is determined
by the simultaneous variation of µF , µR and µF F in the
numerator and denominator. Cross sections for different
members of the oxygen nPDF error set are also matched
to the corresponding error set members in the proton
baseline, maximising the uncertainty cancellation. For
NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs, uncertainties in RAA are
computed by taking the cross-section ratio for each member in the error set and then applying the corresponding
uncertainty prescription.

the scale uncertainty (see also Refs. [53, 54]). However,
the ratio is approximately constant, which indicates that
a suitable choice of fragmentation scale can better reproduce the spectra, see Ref. [55].

In cyan and olive bands, I show 68% confidence intervals computed with NNFF1.1h and NPC23 charged
hadron FFs. NNFF1.1h results are only slightly shifted
above the data. NPC23 results have a smaller uncertainty band, but the momentum dependence is different
from the one observed in data. Taking into account the
scale uncertainty, NNFF1.1h and NPC23 results are in
good agreement with experimental data, which is not surprising, since these FFs are fitted to LHC proton-proton
data. Finally, I note that proton PDFs are much better constrained than FFs, and the corresponding (much
smaller) uncertainty
is not shown in Fig. 1. See the pre√
dictions at s = 5.36 TeV in Section III B and Ref. [53]
for proton PDF uncertainties in the spectrum.

RESULTS

Nuclear modification factor

In Fig. 2, I present the no-quenching baseline results
h
for the charged-hadron nuclear√modification factor RAA
in oxygen–oxygen collisions at s = 5.36 TeV, within the
kinematic range |y| < 0.8 and 4 GeV < pT < 200 GeV.
Additional results for other rapidity intervals are provided in Section A.
The brown and red shaded bands indicate the LO and
NLO scale uncertainties, computed with EPPS21 nPDFs
and BKK FFs. At pT ≳ 20 GeV, these uncertainties cancel efficiently in the ratio, and the NLO band becomes
comparable to the line thickness. At lower pT , scale uncertainties grow more noticeable, yet the NLO band remains fully nested within the LO band, reflecting good
perturbative convergence.
The hatched red, blue, and orange bands correspond
to the 68% confidence intervals of EPPS21, TUJU21,
and nNNPDF3.0 nPDFs (all with BKK FFs). For
pT ≳ 20 GeV, the three nPDFs are consistent, with
overlapping uncertainty bands. In the range 20 GeV ≲
pT ≲ 100 GeV, EPPS21 gives the widest uncertainty
band (∼ 5%), while for pT ≳ 100 GeV, nNNPDF3.0 becomes slightly broader. TUJU21 shows the narrowest
uncertainties, though this reflects its limited dataset and
restrictive parametrisation [47]. Interestingly, the central
h
values of all three nPDFs yield RAA
> 1 in the interval
30 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 120 GeV, though still consistent with
unity within EPPS21 and nNNPDF3.0 uncertainties.

At lower momenta (pT ≲ 20 GeV), nPDF uncertainties
increase, and differences between the extractions become
more pronounced. TUJU21 and nNNPDF3.0 remain centred near unity, whereas the EPPS21 band drops below
unity for pT ≲ 10 GeV. Thus, experimental observations

nal medium-induced energy loss.
Next, I examine the sensitivity to fragmentation functions (FFs). The cyan and olive bands show the 68%
confidence intervals for NNFF1.1h and NPC23 chargedhadron FFs. For both uncertainty cancellation is excellent with bands barely wider than the line thickness
across the full pT range. Results with NPC23 closely
match those with BKK FFs, whereas NNFF1.1h exhibits
h
falls well bestriking deviations: at pT ≳ 70 GeV, RAA
low unity. As discussed in Section B, this originates
from strong isospin breaking in NNFF1.1h, where downquark fragmentation is significantly suppressed. Since
oxygen nuclei contain a larger fraction of down quarks,
the hadron yield is reduced at high pT , where quark fragmentation dominates [30]. Such strong isospin breaking is unexpected, given that charged hadrons are dominated by pions. Nevertheless, in the intermediate region
(20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV), differences between FF sets
remain below 5%.
The black dashed line in Fig. 2 shows the central prediction for the neutral-pion RAA obtained with NPC23
h
FFs. It closely follows the charged-hadron RAA
with the
same FF set, as expected, since charged-hadron production is pion-dominated and the neutral-pion FFs are constructed from charged-pion FFs.

over most of the momentum range. This reflects the fact
that the nuclear mass number dependence is poorly constrained in current nPDFs, leading to strongly correlated
and nearly identical modifications for oxygen and neon.
Consequently, the nuclear modification factor baseline for
neon–neon collisions can be taken as essentially identical
to that for oxygen–oxygen within current knowledge of
nPDFs.

Differential hadron cross section

For completeness, in Fig. 4 I present pQCD calculations of the absolute pT -differential hadron cross section
in minimum-bias
(left) pp and (right) oxygen–oxygen col√
lisions at s = 5.36 TeV with |y| < 0.8. The OO spectrum does not include final-state modifications and is
normalised by the square of the nuclear mass number,
A2 . The lower panels display the ratios to the central
NLO prediction obtained with BKK FFs, using (left)
CT18ANLO PDFs and (right) EPPS21 nPDFs.
The brown and red bands indicate the LO and NLO
scale uncertainties. At LO, the uncertainty remains large
across the entire pT range. At NLO, the band is largely
contained within the LO one, except for phT < 20 GeV. At

high momenta, the NLO uncertainty reduces to ∼ 15%.
For pp, the PDF uncertainties are below 4% (not shown
in Fig. 1). The results with CT18ANLO and nNNPDF3.0
are in good agreement, while TUJU21 exhibits a different trend, crossing the other two around phT ∼ 50 GeV.
For OO collisions, EPPS21 nPDF uncertainties are substantially larger, exceeding 5%, and are mostly consistent
with nNNPDF3.0 results, while TUJU21 again shows a
distinct momentum dependence.
Finally, sizeable discrepancies arise between BKK,
NNFF1.0h, and NPC23 FFs, which are not covered by
the uncertainty bands of NNFF1.0h and NPC23. Predictions with NNFF1.0h lie about 25% below those with
BKK, while the NPC23-to-BKK ratio exhibits a pronounced momentum dependence. Nevertheless, all FF
sets remain mutually consistent once the NLO scale uncertainty is taken into account.

CONCLUSIONS

In July 2025 the LHC collided oxygen ions for the first
time, providing a unique opportunity to search for an unambiguous signal of jet quenching in a system with, on
average, only about ten participating nucleons. Because
the expected signal is small, it is essential to quantify
precisely the difference in the initial perturbative production of high-momentum partons between oxygen–oxygen
and proton–proton collisions. To this end, I have carried out a systematic study of the no-quenching baseline
for the single-inclusive hadron nuclear modification fac-

sNN = 5.36 TeV. Using state-of-the-art nuclear parton
distribution functions (nPDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs), I have provided a robust estimate of the
theoretical uncertainties associated with this baseline.
In the momentum window 20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV, the
baseline can be controlled at the ∼ 5% level, with nPDFs
representing the dominant source of uncertainty. At
lower and higher pT , however, the combined nPDF and
FF uncertainties become sizeable, potentially limiting the
ability to disentangle medium effects from the baseline.
The difference between neutral-pion and charged-hadron
h
RAA
is negligible compared with the nPDF uncertainties,
indicating that both observables are equally suitable for
probing medium-induced energy loss.
The largest systematic uncertainty in charged-hadron
h
RAA
, particularly at low pT , stems from the limited
knowledge of oxygen nPDFs. The large pO dataset recently collected at the LHC will be crucial for constraining oxygen nPDFs in future global fits [56]. At high
pT , I find non-negligible discrepancies between different
FF extractions, which appear to originate from isospinsymmetry breaking in some sets. These discrepancies will
hopefully be resolved in future global FF analyses, potentially aided by input from hadron spectra in pA collisions.
In parallel, theoretical advances in charged hadron computations—NNLO accuracy in hadronic collisions [57]
and N3LO in electron–positron annihilation [58]—are
paving the way towards substantially more precise FF
determinations.
In conclusion, the charged-hadron nuclear modification
factor in oxygen–oxygen collisions can be predicted to
within ∼ 5% in the most favourable kinematic range.
Whether this precision is sufficient to observe a jetquenching signal in such a small system will also depend
on experimental uncertainties and the potential signal
size [30–37]. In particular, a new source of experimental
uncertainty arises in oxygen beams due to transmutation into other ion species [59]. Finally, the collected
oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon data at the same energy
provide an additional handle: the ratio of hadron spectra
between NeNe and OO collisions would largely cancel the
nPDF uncertainties in the perturbative baseline, while
still allowing for a potential medium-induced signal [36].

In this section, I discuss the origin of the surprising

suppression of RAA
obtained with NNFF1.1h FFs in
Fig. 2.
In Fig. 6, I show the charged-hadron fragmentation
functions Dih (z) for down (solid lines) and up (dashed
lines) quarks from NNFF1.1h and NPC23 at µF F =
100 GeV. The vertical axis is scaled by z 3 , motivated
by the LO cross-section formula [30]:

hadron cross section is proportional to the third moment
of the FFs, i.e., the area under the z 3 Dih (z) curve.
For NPC23, the up- and down-quark FFs are very similar (Fig. 6). This reflects the fact that NPC23 chargedhadron FFs are dominated by pions, which exhibit a high
degree of isospin symmetry [50]. In contrast, NNFF1.1h
shows a much smaller down-quark FF compared with
the up-quark FF. The flavour separation of quark FFs
is poorly constrained by data and typically requires additional assumptions. In NNFF1.1h [49], flavour separation was introduced following the procedure for kaons
described in Appendix A of Ref. [62]. Since charged kaons
are not symmetric under d ↔ u exchange, this approach
naturally leads to FFs that violate isospin symmetry.
In Fig. 7, I demonstrate that this up–down difference drives the discrepancy observed in Fig. 2. To this
end, I performed LO cross-section calculations with modh
ified FFs. The solid lines show RAA
with the original NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs combined with EPPS21
nPDFs. The dotted lines correspond to computations
where the down-quark FF is set equal to the up-quark
FF (enforcing strict isospin symmetry). In this case, the
NPC23 results remain essentially unchanged and consistent with the observed isospin symmetry in Fig. 6. In
contrast, the NNFF1.1h results become nearly identical to those of NPC23. Conversely, setting the downquark FF to zero (maximal isospin asymmetry) leaves
NNFF1.1h largely unaffected, while NPC23 develops

These modifications only affect the high-pT region, since
at pT < 50 GeV hadron production is dominated by gluon
fragmentation [30].
