Abstract
An attempt has been made to analyse the the role of octonions in various unified field
theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split octonion algebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation for
SU (2) × U (1) electroweak theory and SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) grand unified theory. Describing the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces
(namely associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational
interaction (G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of octonionic split formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various
field equations for unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have reconstructed the field equations of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is
shown that the difference between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion
hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because
the velocities of octonion hot dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales.
Key Words: octonions, split-octonions, monopole, dyons, non-Abelian gauge theories,

Introduction

According to celebrated Hurwitz theorem there exists [1] a set of four division algebra {R, C, H, O}

namely the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C), quaternions (H) [2, 3] and octonions (O)
[4, 5, 6]. All these four algebra’s are alternative with totally anti symmetric associators. Real
number explains well the classical Newtonian mechanics while the complex number plays an
important role for the explanation beyond the framework of quantum theory and relativity. Real
and complex numbers are limited only up to two dimensions while quaternions are extended to
four dimensions (one real and three imaginaries), on the other hand the octonions represent eight
dimensions (one real and seven imaginaries). Real and complex numbers are commutative and
1

associative. Quaternions are associative but not commutative while the octonions are neither
commutative and nor associative but alternative. Quaternions are well connected [7] with the
familiar SU (2) group and naturally unify [8, 9] electromagnetism and weak force responsible for
the electroweak SU (2) × U (1) sector of standard model. The octonion analysis has played an

important role in the context of various physical problems [10 -17] higher dimensional supersymmetry, super gravity and super strings. Octonions are also [13 -15] used for unification program

of strong interaction with successful gauge theory of fundamental interactions. A theoretical description of the leptons and quark structure of hadrons has already been proposed by Günaydin
and Gursey [18] in the context of octonionic quantum mechanics in terms of octonionic Hilbert
space.
Rather, there has been continuing interests of many authors [19 -21] towards the developments of wave equation and octonion form of Maxwell’s equations. We [22 -31] have also discussed
the significance of octonions to develop generalized octonion electrodynamics, generalized split
octonion electrodynamics, octonion quantum chromodynamics, octonionic non-Abelian gauge
theory, octonion and conservation laws for dyons, octonion electrodynamics in isotropic and chiral medium, octonion massive electrodynamics, octonionic representation of superstring theory,
octonion model of dark matter, octonion symmetric Dirac-Maxwell’s equations and obtained the
corresponding field equations and equation of motion in compact and consistence way. Keeping in
mind the recent update of theoretical physics, we have made to analyze the the role of octonions
in various unified field theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split
octonion algebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation
for SU (2) × U (1) electroweak theory and SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) grand unified theory. Describing
the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces (namely
associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational interaction
(G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of octonionic split
formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various field equations for
unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have reconstructed the field equations of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is shown that the difference
between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) is
significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because the velocities of octonion hot
dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales. As such, there exists more cold dark
matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic field equations.

The Split Octonion

An octonion O is expressed [22-29] as a real linear combination of the unit octonions (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ,
e4 , e5 , e6 , e7 ) as

O ≃ (O0 , O1 , O2 , O3 , O4 , O5 , O6 , O7 ) = O0 e0 +

7
X

A=1

OA eA ,

(1)

where eA (A = 1, 2, ....., 7) are imaginary octonion units and e0 is the real octonion unit element.
The octet (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 , e6 , e7 ) is known as the octonion basis where eA satisfy the following
2

multiplication rules
e0 = 1, e2A = −1, e0 eA = eA e0 = eA ,
eA eB = − δAB e0 + fABC eC . (A, B, C = 1, 2, ......7)

(2)

The structure constants fABC are completely antisymmetric and take the value 1, i.e.
fABC = +1 7−→ (ABC) ≡ (123), (471), (257), (165), (624), (543), (736) .

(3)

Therefore, we get the following relations among octonion basis elements as
[eA , eB ] = 2fABC eC , {eA , eB } = −δAB e0 , eA (eB eC ) 6= (eA eB )eC ,

(4)

where δAB is the usual Kronecker delta-Dirac symbol.
Like wise, the split octonions [25, 26] are a non associative extension of split quaternions (associative). Split octonions differ from the octonions in the signature of quadratic form. The split
octonion have a signature (4, 4) whereas the octonions have positive signature (8, 0). The Cayley
algebra of octonion over the field of complex number CC = C ⊗ C is visualized as the algebra of
split octonions with its following basis elements,

u
where i =

u

u∗0 = 12 (e0 − ie7 ) ;

(5)
(∀ j = 1, 2, 3)

−1 is assumed
to commute

 with eA (A = 1, 2, ......, 7) octonion units. The split

octonion basis elements u0 , uj , u∗0 , u∗j satisfy the following multiplication rules,
ui uj = ǫijk u∗k ; u∗i u∗j = −ǫijk u∗k ; (∀i, j, k = 1, 2, 3)

ui u∗j = − δij u0 ; ui u0 = 0; u∗i u0 = u∗i ;

u∗i uj = − δij u0 ; ui u∗0 = ui ; u∗i u∗0 = 0 ;
u0 ui = ui ;

(6)

u∗0 ui = 0; u0 u∗i = 0 ;

∗

u∗0 u∗i = ui ; u20 = u0 ; u∗2

Thus the multiplication table of split octonionic basis elements is given in Table-1.

The automorphism group of octonion is described [32, 33] as G2 . Its subgroup which leaves
imaginary octonion unit e7 invariant (or equivalently the idempotents u0 and u∗0 ) is SU (3). Here
the units uj and u∗j (j = 1, 2, 3) transform respectively like a triplet and anti triplet respectively associated with colour and anti colour triplets of SU (3) group. We may now introduce a
convenient realization for the basis elements (u0 , uj , u∗0 , u∗j ) in term of Pauli’s spin matrices as

(∀j = 1, 2, 3)

So, the split octonion algebra is now expressed in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrices components
of which are scalar and vector parts of a quaternion, i.e.
O =

(

m ~
p
q~

n

!

;

m, n ∈ Sc(H);

)

(8)

& p~,~q ∈ V ec(H) .

As such, we write an arbitrary split octonion A ∈ O in terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector

matrix realization as

A = au∗0 + bu0 + xi u∗i + yi ui ≃

a −−

where a and b are scalars and ~x and y~ are three vectors. Thus the product of two octonions in

where (×) denotes the usual vector product, ej (j = 1, 2, 3) with ej × ek = ǫjkl el and ej ek = −δjk .
Octonion conjugate of equation (9) in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization is now defined

as

where 1̂ is the identity elements of matrix order 2 × 2, and the expression n(A) = (ab + −

(13)

Thus, we may easily express the Euclidean or Minkowski four vector in split octonion formulation
4

in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realizations. Consequently, any four-vector Aµ (complex
or real) can equivalently be written in terms of the following Zorn matrix realization as

The split octonion valued space time vector Zµ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) in terms of the 4 × 4 (space time
vector-valued) Zorn matrix Zµab may now be expressed as [10],

where µ (∀ 0, 1, 2, 3) represents the internal four dimensional space. Here µ = 0 describes U (1)
abelian gauge structure while µ = j (∀ j = 1, 2, 3) is associated with the SU (2) non-Abelian
gauge structure [26]. Here xµ0 , xµj , y0µ , yjµ are real valued variables for abelian and non-Abelian
gauge fields. When the space time metric [10, 11] is ηµν 1̂4×4 , the bi linear term

while the Hermitian conjugation is described [10, 11] as

Accordingly, the octonion Aµ (x) with a space-time index [34], may now be written in terms of
the split generators as
Aµ (x) = aµ (x)u∗0 + bµ (x)u0 + Xiµ (x)u∗i + Yiµ (x)ui , (i = 1, 2, 3)

(21)

where the coefficients of Aµ (x) transform like vectors under space-time transformations. As such,

5

the space-time covariant derivative of Aµ (x) can be written as the following form:
Aµ+;α = Aµ,α + Ωµρα Aρ ,
Aµ−;α = Aµ,α + Ωµαρ Aρ ,

(22)

where Ωµρα → Ωµρα .12×2 is the affinity of the nonsymmetric theory [34] and 12×2 ≃ (u∗0 + u0 ) is
the unit element of the split octonion algebra. Similarly the space-time curvature is given by
σ
σ .1
Rµνρ
2×2 , where Rµνρ is the curvature of nonsymmetric theory.

Octonionic electroweak formulation

In order to discuss the role of split octonion in particle physics, we describe the U (1) × SU (2)

electroweak gauge formulation in terms of the split octonion representation. Thus, we may write

an octonion as the combination of two gauge fields (i.e. Aµ and Bµ are respectively associated
with electric and magnetic charges) expanded in terms of quaternions, i.e.
Aµ
Bµ

A0µ e0 + Aaµ ea

(23)

, (∀ a = 1, 2, 3)

where the components A0µ and B0µ are described respectively as the electric and magnetic four
potentials of dyons for U (1) gauge formalism. Rather, Aaµ and Baµ represent two non-Abelian
SU (2) gauge field due to the presence of electric and magnetic charges of dyons. As such, the
covariant derivative for the case of double fold degeneracy of U (1)×SU (2) gauge theory is defined
as

which is U (1) × SU (2) octonion gauge field strength for dyons in terms of 2×2 Zorn matrix

Octonionic formulation of Grand Unified Theory

Keeping in mind the role of octonion in gauge field theories, let us start with the local SU (3) ×

SU (2) × U (1) gauge symmetry which is an internal symmetry representing the Standard Model

(SM). The smallest simple Lie group which contains the standard model, and upon which the
first Grand Unified Theory (GUT) was based, is SU (5) ⊃ SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1). Thus we

may extend SU (2) × U (1) electroweak gauge theory to the SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1) gauge theory

(GUT) in terms of split octonion formulation. We may now write the SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)
gauge field for generalized fields of dyons as
Aµ
Bµ

7−→

A0µ e0 + Aaµ ea + Aαµ eα
B0µ e0 + Baµ ea + Bαµ eα

(∀ µ = 0, 1, 2, 3; a = 1, 2, 3; α = 1, 2, ......, 8)
where the components of electric A0µ and magnetic B0µ are the four potentials of dyons in case
of U (1). Similarly, the Aaµ , Baµ and Aαµ , Bαµ describe the SU (2) and SU (3) gauge field strengths
for dyons in terms of split octonions. So, the covariant derivative for SU (3) × SU (2) × U (1)
octonion gauge field in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization of split octonions is then

described as
Dµ =

Octonion formulation with linear gravity

Here we assume the octonion eight dimensional space, combination of two quaternionic spaces
respectively associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational
interaction (G-space) [35, 36, 37]. Thus, we may write the split octonionic unified representation
of gravitational-electromagnetic (G-EM) space in terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix
realization as

whereas the charge and mass [30] of the particle in octonion formulation may also be analysed

J(em−g)/(g−em) = Q(em−g)/(g−em) V(em−g)/(g−em) ,

Jg−g = Q(g−g) V(g−g) , J(em−em) = Q(em−em) V(em−em) ,

of the gravitational- gravitational (G-G), electromagnetic- gravitational (EM-G), gravitationalelectromagnetic (G-EM) interactions etc., while Q(em−em) represent the charge of the electromagneticelectromagnetic (EM-EM) interaction. Thus Q(g−g) , Q(em−g) , Q(g−em) , their other combinations
and Q(em−em) respectively describe the generalized mass and generalized charge [30, 35, 36, 37]of
dyons in the consistent unified picture for split octonions.

Octonion Dark Matter (ODM)

Dark matter [38, 39] is a type of matter hypothesized to account for a large part of the total
mass in the universe. Only about 4.6% of the mass-energy of the universe is ordinary matter,
about 23% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 72% is thought to consist
of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed almost uniformly in space and with
energy density non-evolving or slowly evolving with time. On the other hand, the nonbaryonic
form of octonionic dark matter [38, 39] is evident through its gravitational effect only.
However, form experiment point of views the summary of the current measurements of the
matter density Ωmatter , the dark matter density ΩDM and the energy density Ωenergy is already
given by Hagiwara [41]. Each are in units of the critical density ρcritical ≃ 3h2 /(8πG), where G
is the Newton’s gravitational constant, and h is the present value of the Hubble constant. The

experimental results [42, 43] require the best current values of the matter and energy densities
respectively given as Ωmatter ≃ 0.27 and Ωenergy ≃ 0.73. The measurements describe the baryon

density Ωbaryon to a value less than ∼ 0.03. The difference Ωmatter − Ωbaryon ≃ 0.24 must be in

the form of non-baryonic dark matter. Some experimental results for energy, matter and dark
matter densities [44, 45] are shown in Table-2.

The ranges of density parameters within the standard cosmological model derived from the
first release data with corresponding values newest data and h ≃ 0.74 ± 0.08 is the Hubble

Ωmatter

≃

Ωbaryon + ΩHot−dark−matter + ΩCold−dark−matter

≃

Ωbaryon + ΩDM ,

(68)

includes both baryonic matter and dark matter. Moreover the dark matter can be classed either
as hot or cold depending on whether it was relativistic or not in the early universe. So, we can
analyse the hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. We assume that the total
octonionic dark matter density (ODM) is described as
(69)

ΩO−DM ≃ ΩO−HDM + ΩO−CDM ,

where ΩO−HDM describes the octonionic hot dark matter density (OHDM) while ΩO−CDM
describes the octonionic cold dark matter density (OCDM).

Octonion Hot and Cold Dark matter

Let us assumed that the octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) describes the particles that have
zero or near-zero masses. Thus we assume that the octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) is
associated with the gravitational-gravitational (G-G), electromagnetic-electromagnetic (EM-EM)
and the combination of (G-G) and (EM-EM) fields [30, 35, 36, 37] interactions. So, the hot dark
matter may then be described in terms of following 2×2 Zorn vector matrix realization of split
octonions, i.e.
FO−HDM =

0
i V j )e

where FO−HDM is an octonionic field strength represents the hot dark matter. So, the components of equation (70) are given as


Here the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) represents the quantas of EM-EM interactions
(namely photons) and G-G interactions (i.e. gravitons). Similarly, the required current source
density for octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) is expressed by the following split octonion form
as,
JO−HDM =

which represent the non-baryonic octonion hot dark matter current source density JO−HDM

associated with massless photons, gravitons, etc. Thus the current source equations for octonionic
hot dark matter (OHDM) are given below:


Rather, the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) can be described as the composition of the
massive objects moving at sub-relativistic velocities. So, the difference between the octonion
cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonions hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the
formulation of structure, because the velocities of octonions hot dark matter cause it to wipe
out structure on small scales. Thus, the octonions cold dark matter is associated with the
electromagnetic-gravitational (EM-G), gravitational-electromagnetic (G-EM) and their mixed
interactions. Thus, we analyse the octonion cold dark matter for massive particles, responsible
for EM-G and G-EM interactions, i.e.
FO−CDM =

So, the quantum equations for octonionic hot and cold dark matter may easily be expressed in the
terms of simpler and compact notation of octonions representations. From the foregoing analysis

we find the matter density of octonionic cold dark matter (OCDM) i.e. 0.10 ≤ h2 ΩCDM ≤ 0.32

is grater than that of octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) as 0.00 ≤ h2 ΩHDM ≤ 0.12 . As such,

there exists more cold dark matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic
field equations.
