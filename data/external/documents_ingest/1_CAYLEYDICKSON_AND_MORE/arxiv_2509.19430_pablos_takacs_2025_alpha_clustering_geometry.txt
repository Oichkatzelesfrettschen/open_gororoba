The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and
the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems.
Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the
interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend
a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic
attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with
RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as
hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict
both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss
that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding the emergence of collective behavior in
small collision systems, such as pp and pA collisions, remains one of the central challenges for both the highenergy physics and heavy-ion communities since their
discovery at the LHC more than a decade ago [1–4] (for
recent reviews, see [5–7]). While the dynamical origin of
this collectivity is still under investigation, hydrodynamic
models, originally thought to be valid only for large systems such as AA collisions, have proven quantitatively
successful in describing several low-momentum observables in small systems as well [8–11] (a non-exhaustive
list of alternative explanations includes [12–17]).
This hydrodynamic picture requires the presence of a
deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), implying finalstate interactions and consequently jet quenching [18–20].
In AA collisions, jet modifications are firmly established,
and their dependence on the medium size is consistent
with expectations from parton energy-loss calculations
performed using perturbative QCD or holographic techniques [21–24]. However, in pA collisions, jet quenching
remains elusive, possibly due to the short path lengths
involved [25–28]. Despite the absence of measurable energy loss, significant azimuthal anisotropies have been
observed in high-pT particles in pA systems [29–31]. In
AA collisions, this anisotropy is understood in terms of
differences in energy loss due to the different path lengths

traversed as a function of the jet orientation with respect
to the reaction plane of the collision [32, 33], adding further puzzling elements to the picture we attempt to draw
for small systems.
Recent LHC runs on OO and NeNe collisions have
provided a valuable bridge between small (pp and pA)
and large (such as PbPb and AuAu) collision systems,
thereby reducing uncertainties related to short path
lengths and centrality determination [34–37]. In these
smaller systems, fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium dynamics are believed to play an increasingly critical role
in achieving quantitative precision [38–41].
In this work, we extend our semi-analytic jet quenching framework [42–44] by incorporating these elements to
enable reliable predictions for the upcoming experimental results on the potential existence of jet quenching
effects in OO collisions. We account for medium fluctuations by coupling the framework to state-of-the-art
event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of the expanding fireball within which jets are produced and subsequently traverse. Before hydrodynamics is believed to be
applicable, we incorporate quenching effects during the
pre-equilibrium phase via the hydrodynamic attractor extracted from QCD kinetic theory, representing the first
time this is done in a realistic model for jet quenching.
We benchmark our model against a broad set of AA
data, including both LHC and RHIC energies and collision systems, spanning wide ranges in centrality, jet
cone size and transverse momentum. Using Bayesian parameter estimation, we achieve a simultaneous and conjet
sistent description of jet suppression RAA
(pT ) and elliptic anisotropy v2jet (pT ) across all available data. We
jet
show that the combination of RAA
and v2jet provides

2
constraints on energy-loss effects in the pre-equilibrium
phase. The resulting posterior distributions can then be
used to predict jet and hadron observables in other collision systems, including OO as we do in the present work.
II.

FRAMEWORK

Our jet quenching framework builds on previous results from [42–44], which we briefly summarize here. We
introduce two key new components: (i) the coupling to
event-by-event fluctuating hydrodynamics, and (ii) energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase using the hydrodynamic attractor.
Our starting point is the vacuum jet cross section,
σipp (pT , R), computed using MadGraph+Pythia [45–47] at
NLO+LL accuracy. We reconstructed jets and assigned
their flavor (i = q/g) with the Flavor-kt [48]. Nuclear
PDF (nPDF) effects are incorporated using EPPS21 [49]
within the LHAPDF [50] framework, yielding the modified
cross section σ̃ pp (pT , R). The charged hadron spectrum
is evaluated by convoluting this jet spectrum with the
NPC23 [51] fragmentation function (FF).
The quenched jet cross section is described via the convolution of the nPDF-modified jet cross section with the
energy-loss probability distribution:
X Z
AA
σ (pT , R) =
dεPi (ε, R, pT )σ̃ipp (pT + ε, R) . (1)
i=q,g

Energy is lost predominantly due to medium-induced
emissions escaping the jet cone R, as encoded in
Pi (ε, R, pT ). The emission rate is computed using the
Improved Opacity Expansion in a static medium, which
captures both single hard and multiple soft scatterings,
and also includes finite path length corrections [52, 53].
Medium properties affect these rates through LO Hard
Thermal Loop results, namely the (bare) jet quench2
ing parameter q̂0 = gmed
Nc m2D T /(4π), and the Debye
2
T 2 /2, where T is the local
screening mass m2D = 3gmed
temperature of the hydrodynamic medium. Here, gmed
is the (fixed, i.e. non-running) strong coupling for jetmedium interactions, representing the first of the two parameters we will estimate using Bayesian inference. We
assume factorization between induced collinear emissions
and transverse momentum broadening: semi-hard emissions undergo Gaussian broadening, while hard emissions
inherit their transverse momentum from the Coulomb
tail of the scattering potential. Since the softest emissions thermalize rapidly [54], they should be considered
part of the medium and contribute to hydrodynamic
wakes [55, 56], a manifestation of medium response to
the jet passage. We approximate these physics by assuming that the thermalized energy is distributed uniformly around the jet hemisphere. Elastic energy loss is
also included and constrained via the Einstein relation
ê = q̂/(4T ), and is assumed to thermalize in a similar
fashion. Here, q̂ accounts for the logarithmic corrections
of q̂0 (see later).

Energetic jets consist of multiple partons produced
by the high-virtuality DGLAP evolution that occurs at
the early stages of the in-medium jet propagation [57].
These partons represent an additional source of energy
loss. We account for this by resumming these multiple
sources via a factorization between early vacuum-like and
medium-induced emissions [58]. Importantly, we also include color-coherence, and -resolution [59–61] effects (referred to as coherent energy loss) by incorporating the
non-local angular scale below whichpthe medium cannot
resolve individual partons, θc ∼ 1/ q̂L3 , with L being
the traversed medium length. Detailed formulas are provided in [44].
Jet propagation occurs within an event-by-event fluctuating 2+1D hydrodynamic background. We employ
hydro profiles from the comprehensive multi-stage framework IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD, which successfully describes a wide range of bulk observables in
heavy-ion collisions [62]. This state-of-the-art framework evolves the bulk starting from the initial energy
density deposited at specific hotspots determined by the
IPSat [63]. Jet probes are placed precisely onto these
hotspots, whose number is proportional to the number
of binary collisions Ncoll , and their initial orientation is
uniformly distributed in the azimuthal angle ϕ. Straight
jet trajectories are sampled from their production point
until they exit the deconfined medium at T < Tc , with
Tc marks the crossover transition to the hadron gas
phase. The medium and jet-medium interaction quantities needed for the computation of radiative and elastic
energy loss are then obtained by averaging along each jet
trajectory, as extracted from the hydrodynamic profiles.
We neglect further quenching below Tc . For more details on the embedding of our jet quenching framework in
the realistic heavy-ion environment, see Ref. [44], where
event-averaged hydro profiles were used instead. Event
classification into centrality classes is based on the final
charged particle multiplicity of the bulk, from which one
also extracts the soft event-plane angles Ψn , necessary for
computing the jet flow coefficients. Thus, our framework
predicts the quenched jet spectrum for various parameters σ AA% (pT , η, ϕ, R).
The hydrodynamic description of the bulk begins at a
finite time τhyd = 0.4 fm. The initial condition of this
nearly ideal fluid is reached through the Glasma evolution
of saturated gluon fields (for reviews on this approach to
thermalization, see [64, 65]). Quenching effects have traditionally been neglected before this time, largely due
to the absence of reliable energy-loss calculations in the
non-equilibrated phase. While an earlier start could be
mimicked by adjusting the jet-medium coupling, combined observables such as high-pT RAA and v2 are known
to be sensitive to the actual value of the quenching onset
time [66, 67]. The need to address jet quenching in the
earliest stages has been emphasized in recent works where
the pre-hydro phase is modeled either by Glasma [68, 69]
or by QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) [70, 71]. Despite differences in approach, these studies consistently

with η/s = 0.12, where T (x) is the local initial temperature. We assume that our energy-loss model can be applied without any additional modification by using these
extrapolated pre-equilibrium temperatures. Before τmin ,
no quenching is applied, and we take this time as the
second parameter of our Bayesian inference.
Finally, fluid velocity fields also evolve during the preequilibrium phase, as initial spatial anisotropies begin to
generate flow [65]. This non-equilibrium evolution is well
approximated by the universal pre-flow extracted from
EKT [80]. We incorporate it by scaling the transverse
velocity linearly with time:

veff,z (τ ) = tanh ηs ,

where the longitudinal velocity scales with the space-time
rapidity ηs .

In the present work, we extend our energy loss framework to the pre-equilibrium stage as follows. The outof-equilibrium evolution of the local energy density has
been extensively studied in EKT [72–77], and it is well
captured by the hydrodynamic attractor. We use the attractor to extrapolate the effective local temperature for
times τ earlier than τhyd as [78, 79]:

where x = 2phT cosh(η)/ s, and we used the jet scale
h
µF = pT R/z. We averaged over (u, d, s) FFs and neglected the others. This simple convolution neglects
medium effects in fragmentation, and thus ignores, for
example, the impact of the angular redistribution of particles due to broadening.
Our work resembles previous studies of RAA and
v2 [66, 67, 82–96]. In contrast to these works, we focus on jets instead of hadrons, since jets are infraredand collinear-safe, and have small non-perturbative corrections in vacuum [97–100]. We use state-of-the-art hydrodynamics and energy-loss formulas, including elastic
energy loss as well as the effects of medium response. To
our knowledge, this is the first model implementation of
jet energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase carried out
in a physically well-motivated manner.
We employ Bayesian inference, implemented via the
JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103], to constrain the jetmedium strong coupling gmed and the initial quenching time in the pre-equilibrium phase τmin . We used
flat priors in the intervals 1.2 ≤ gmed ≤ 1.7, and
jet
0.01 ≤ τmin [fm] ≤ 0.4. Our data points include RAA
at LHC energies for different jet-cones and centrality selections [104–106], as well as jet v2jet [81], up to 40-50%
centrality. The inference incorporates statistical and systematic uncertainties of the data, and we estimate the
full correlation matrix by employing a finite correlation
length of 0.2 [102, 107]. Luminosity and centrality uncertainties are added to the systematics. We neglect inherent model uncertainties in the inference such as scale and
nPDF uncertainties, and we will present them separately

for the OO predictions.
Figure. 1 shows the parameter posterior for two difjet
ferent scenarios. Fitting only RAA
(blue) results in little
constraint on τmin . This is expected, as an earlier starting
time can be compensated by a relatively smaller medium
coupling to produce the same energy loss. Including v2jet
constrains τmin ≈ 0.24 fm (red). This inference illustrates
the role of pre-equilibrium effects in v2jet .
Before moving to our predictions for oxygen collisions,
Fig. 4 in App. A shows the posterior predictive distributions. We observe excellent overall agreement with all
data. Small tensions can be found in v2jet at low pT , which
motivates further improvements of the energy loss framework. For completeness, we also show inference results on
gmed with two limiting scenarios: early pre-equilibrium
with fixed τmin = 0.08 fm, and no pre-equilibrium with
τmin = 0.4 fm. The best fit (whose parameters are shown
in Fig. 1) outperforms these two scenarios, although differences are not very significant. The extracted bare
jet transport coefficient is approximately q̂0 /T 3 ≈ 1.7,
while after logarithmic corrections the effective value is
q̂/T 3 = q̂0 /T 3 log(Q2s /µ2∗ ) ≈ 7, where Q2s = q̂0 L, and
µ2∗ = m2D e−2+2γE /4. We note that this extracted q̂ is
consistent with other recent extractions using Bayesian
inference in the JETSCAPE framework [103].
Figure 5 in App. A provides predictions for jets at
RHIC energies [108] and charged hadrons at LHC energies [109–112] using the extracted parameters. Even
though our framework was designed for jets, it also provides a good description of the charged hadron RAA without including them in the inference. We also see, however, that our framework underestimates hadron elliptic
flow at low pT . This failure is consistent with previous
findings using pQCD energy loss [66, 67]. It has been
pointed out that a rather late quenching time of around

∼ 1 fm would resolve the disagreement [67]. Alternatively, the absence of this issue for jets signals the need
for model improvements which could be more relevant
for (mid-pT ) hadrons than for jets. Again, for completeness, we show predictions with the previous two limiting
scenarios (early pre-eq. and no pre-eq. energy loss), resulting as before in subtle differences.
OO predictions: The recent OO run at the LHC has
attracted considerable attention, with numerous dedicated studies on, for example, baseline analyses [113–
116] and hadron quenching predictions [117–125]. Compared to these studies, our framework incorporates additional improvements, with an emphasis on jet observables. For our OO predictions of RAA and v2 we have set
√
sN N = 5.36 TeV and |η| < 2.1. We defer to future work
the computation of higher-order flow harmonics, along
with the corresponding predictions for NeNe collisions.
Figure 2 shows our jet and charged hadron predictions
for OO collisions. The left panel shows the inclusive jet
suppression, where the no-quenching baseline, σ̃ pp /σ pp ,
is indicated with gray bands. The dark band represents
NLO scale uncertainties, while the light band is the 68%
confidence of the nPDF. Below 50 GeV for jets and 30
GeV for hadrons, we underestimate nPDF uncertainties
because of the relatively high momentum cutoff we chose
for the NLO cross-sections [115, 116]. This cutoff does
not affect the central value. Quenching effects are shown
with red and blue for different centrality selections. Dark
bands are the 68% confidence of our Bayesian parameter
estimation, and on top of these, 68% nPDF uncertainties are shown with light bands. Peripheral collisions
(30-100%) are less suppressed than central ones (0-30%),
as expected, and clear quenching signals are present towards lower jet pT for both centrality selections. The

sion, which presents a similar pattern to jets.
Figure 3 shows the inclusive jet and charged hadron
elliptic flow. There is relatively smaller sensitivity to
the nPDF, as v2 is an observable that is differential in
the transverse plane, using solely the medium spectra,
so the impact of the nPDF largely cancels in Eq. (5).
Semi-inclusive observables can present analogous advantages [115]. We observe that, in contrast to large collision
systems, the elliptic flow coefficient v2 increases with centrality. This is a consequence of the more prominent role
played by the fluctuations of the initial nuclear shape in
small collision systems [117, 119, 126]. Jet distributions
are not shown for very low pT , where our framework is
not expected to apply.
Due to the relatively small path lengths involved in
OO, the typical value of the coherence angle is relatively
large, θc ∼ 0.5, and so R = 0.4 jets are unresolved and
lose energy as single color charges. Therefore, hadron
and jet suppression in our framework can be understood
by the mere pT shift resulting from hadronization. In
contrast, in larger systems (with smaller values of θc )
both RAA and v2 receive additional contributions due to
resolved jet substructure fluctuations [44, 127].
Finally, Fig. 6 in App. B shows our OO predictions
for minimum bias with the different limiting cases introduced previously. Only subtle differences are observed
for earlier vs. later quenching for the ranges of τmin explored.

CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have integrated our semi-analytical jet
quenching model with a state-of-the-art description of
heavy-ion collisions, IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD.
We incorporated energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase
via the hydrodynamic attractor for the first time. Our
framework provides a simultaneous description of jet
RAA and v2 in agreement with data in AA collisions, offering a strong validation of the approach. We show that
a joint description of these observables places constraints
on the onset time of jet-medium interactions, which is
around 0.2 fm, deep in the pre-equilibrium phase. Then,
we applied these parameters to predict jet and hadron
quenching in other collision systems. We saw that our
framework successfully predicts hadron suppression but
underestimates hadron elliptic flow towards lower pT .
Previous studies have reported similar results, suggesting
that a delayed onset of quenching of about 1 fm could account for the hadron experimental data. Our success in
describing jets, however, would rather suggest the need to
account for additional medium effects whose importance
could grow at lower pT .
Our constrained framework has been used to make
realistic predictions for the intermediate-sized OO collisions. We obtained sizable energy loss both for jets and
charged hadrons, in quantitative agreement with the preliminary results from CMS [128]. Even though we have
shown that pre-equilibrium effects play a moderate role
in our model, we anticipate that including forthcoming
data on high-pT flow coefficients will result in further
constraints. Furthermore, in this work we have provided
predictions for elliptic anisotropies and different centrality selections, both for hadrons and jets. Due to the
small path lengths in OO, unlike in PbPb or AuAu, jet
constituents are barely resolved (jets are fully coherent),
and thus we obtain similar energy loss for hadrons and
jets (modulo a pT shift in fragmentation). This outcome
constitutes a prediction of our framework which can be
confronted with future experimental results on jet suppression in light ions.
As an outlook, our jet quenching framework could benefit from an improved description of medium-induced
emissions, elastic scatterings, and medium response in
several ways. It is important to note that, at very
early times, local color fields are saturated and highly
anisotropic, a scenario which our energy-loss framework,
built on local equilibrium, cannot accommodate. For
these initial stages, it would be desirable to incorporate recent developments in energy-loss calculations for
anisotropic media [129–134], correlated color fields [135],
and out of-equilibrium plasma [136, 137], so as to extend
quenching for those earliest times where the attractor solution is not meant to apply.

Appendix A: Bayesian parameter estimation

We have already introduced our Bayesian framework
in Sec. II, and here we extend this discussion by providing additional details. In this appendix, PbPb and AuAu
cross-sections σ̃ AA (pT , η, R) are computed using the microjet evolution as employed in [42, 44], with initial conditions from LO Pythia at R0 = 1. Our framework is
built on the JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103]. We evaluated our model for 24 design points, equally distributed
in the parameter space. To focus on primary model features that are robust against statistical uncertainty, we
reduced our data to its 10 principal components, and
trained a Gaussian Process Emulator to interpolate between the predictions. The resulting parameter posterior
is shown in the main text in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide two alternative inferences for gmed : one with fixed
τmin = 0.08 fm, (and extracted ⟨gmed ⟩ = 1.385) referred
to as “early preeq”, and another with τmin = 0.4 fm, (extracted ⟨gmed ⟩ = 1.473), referred to as “no preeq”.

Figure 4 shows the corresponding posterior predictive
distributions. These jet data were used to constrain the
model parameters. Different rows correspond to different measurements. We observe good agreement with all
jet
data for both RAA
and v2jet , including all collision energies, centralities, rapidities, jet cone sizes, and momenta.
There is a slight tension in v2jet for the lowest pT bins.
This tension could be do to missing ingredients in the
description of energy loss towards lower pT . Dotted and
dashed lines show the two alternative fits, where τmin is
kept fixed. There are subtle differences between different
fits, with the fixed earlier quenching reducing the jet v2 ,
as expected.
Finally, we also compare our results to jets at RHIC
energies and charged hadron observables, shown in
Fig. 5. As our framework was designed for jets, we did
not include these data in the inference. We see an overall
good agreement with both RHIC energies and charged
hadron RAA . Interestingly, hadron RAA seems to favor
early quenching, as indicated by the dashed lines. There
is a clear underestimation of the hadron elliptic flow at
low momenta, consistent with previous findings from
other theory collaborations, likely linked to the (milder)
tension with low pT jets mentioned above.

Appendix B: OO predictions without
pre-equilibrium quenching

Figure 6 shows the nuclear modification and elliptic
flow for minimum bias OO collisions. Curves represent
the limiting scenarios tested in App. A regarding preequilibrium quenching: “early preeq” denotes τmin = 0.08
fm, “no preeq” τmin = 0.4 fm, with their corresponding
inferred gmed . The best fit denotes our default setting
shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity, we don’t show nPDF
uncertainties. Slight differences are present in the different limiting scenarios. Interestingly, an earlier quenching
can result in a relatively larger v2 , in contrast to larger
systems, likely reflecting the more important role of fluctuations over average geometry in smaller systems.
