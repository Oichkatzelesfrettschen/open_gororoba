Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known prediction of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more
recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While
previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton
amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third
one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016
for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton
amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all
three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the
case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the
electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show
that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to
the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.

Introduction

Although processes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are presently not of direct experimental
relevance, they are of great theoretical interest, and much effort has gone into their study
both at the tree-level [1–6] and the one-loop level [7–11].
A particularly well-studied process is photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field.
Einstein-Maxwell theory contains a tree-level vertex involving two photons and one graviton,

Below we perform the similar, albeit more complicated, calculation of the middle diagram of Fig. 2. Moreover, we provide a unified calculation of all three diagrams using the
worldline formalism, and show that, although the tadpole diagram contributes to the amplitude, it leaves the magnetic dichroism unchanged. Although our main interest is in the
magnetic field and spinor loop case, we will perform all calculations in a general constant
field and for both the scalar and spinor loop, since in the worldline formalism this essentially does not imply any extra computational effort. All formulas required to specialize the
field to a purely magnetic one (as well as a purely electric or crossed-field one) are given in
appendix B.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the worldline
representation of the one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes with a scalar or spinor loop in
vacuum, including a short discussion of the gauge and gravitational Ward identities. In
section 3 we show how to incorporate an external constant electromagnetic field. Section 4
summarizes the worldline calculation of [21, 37] of the “main” or “irreducible” contributions
Γ(irr) to these amplitudes, while section 6 analyzes the contribution Γ(ext) . The central
section is 5 where we derive the new “tadpole” contributions Γ(tadpole) . In section 7 we
study the weak-field expansion of the tadpole contribution in a magnetic field. In section
8 we verify the gravitational Ward identities for these amplitudes, which also provides a
non-trivial check. Section 9 offers our conclusions. Appendix A establishes our conventions
for Einstein-Maxwell theory, while in appendix B we collect some useful formulas involving
the worldline Green’s functions and determinants in a constant field.
Partial results of this work were presented in [62].

One-loop amplitudes with one graviton and N photons

We shortly summarize the worldline approach to the calculation of the one-loop amplitudes
involving a scalar or spinor in the loop and one graviton and N photons, first in vacuum
[28–31, 63, 64]. These amplitudes have an irreducible contribution, where all the external
legs are directly attached to the loop, and a reducible one, where the graviton is attached
to one of the photons.

Reducible contribution

The reducible contribution to the N -photon/one graviton amplitude, where the graviton is
attached to one of the photons, usually would be constructed by sewing together the N photon amplitude and the photon-photon-graviton vertex of Fig. 1. For the analogous case
(red)pp′
of the scalar tree-level propagator dressed with N photons and one graviton, DN,1
, it was
shown in [64] that the effect of this sewing can be expressed by the following replacement

Here we observe that the same replacement rule applies as well for the one-loop N -photon/one
graviton amplitudes with either a scalar or a spinor loop. For the scalar loop this is obvious
from the fact that our derivation of that rule in [64] did not make use at all of the boundary
conditions imposed on the scalar path integral. But neither did we use the specific form
of the scalar vertex operator, and the reader can easily convince herself that changing the
scalar vertex operator into a spinor one will not make a difference here. Thus, without
further ado, we can write down the reducible part of the spinor/scalar loop contribution to
the one-graviton N -photon amplitude as

Inclusion of a constant electromagnetic field
General procedure

The generalisation of the formalism to the case of the photon-graviton amplitudes in a
constant electromagnetic field is straightforward and proceeds essentially as in the purely
electromagnetic case [24, 26, 27, 33, 68–70]: the master formulas (2.1) acquire an additional

The rule (2.14) for the construction of the reducible contributions, where the graviton
gets attached to one of the photons, is also not affected by the presence of the external
field.
At the one-graviton level, the only really new aspect arising from the presence of the
external field is that there is now a second type of reducible contributions, since the graviton
can now be attached also to one of the photons emitted by the external field, see Fig. 7.

It is easy to see that the contribution of this diagram, to be called ΓN,1 , can be
obtained from the purely photonic amplitude with N +1 photons in the field by the following

As is well-known, the constant field vacuum polarization tensors contain the UV divergences of the ordinary vacuum polarization tensors, but no further ones, so that on-shell

Before proceeding further, let us use this integral representation to analyse the general
structure of this amplitude. Although our calculation is nonperturbative in the external
field, we can use the series expansions of GB , ĠB , G̈B and GF , ĠF in the field, whose first few
terms are given in (B.9) - (B.11) and (B.40), (B.41), to compute the amplitude involving a
given number of interactions with the field. It is then immediately seen that this amplitude
is nonzero only if this number of interactions is odd, since otherwise the τ1,2 integrations
vanish by antisymmetry.
The leading term in this expansion in the background field is UV divergent. In dimensional regularisation, this divergence is [21]

where C µν,α is the same tensor that appeared in the tree-level amplitude, eq. (1.2). This
was to be expected since the amplitude must be multiplicatively renormalizable (although
quantum gravity is not a renormalizable theory, amplitudes in Einstein-Maxwell theory
involving gravitational fields and gravitons only externally are still renormalizable by power
counting). Renormalization is performed by subtracting the amplitude at zero field strength
and zero momentum, leading to the following form of the renormalized amplitude Π̄:

integrating over k ′ . This gives

(irr)
contribution Γspin , this one is nothing new; the contribution of the tadpole linear in the field
corresponds to the diagram shown in Fig. 8, which makes it clear that this subtraction is just

the renormalization completely removes the part linear in the field, leaving only terms of
cubic or higher order in the field.

Third contribution to electromagnetic photon-graviton conversion

For the other reducible contribution, corresponding to the third diagram in Fig. 2, we
can use eqs. (3.7), (3.8), with k ′ = k0 = −k, and our results for the vacuum polarization
tensor in a constant field from subsection 3.3. Like the tadpole contribution, it has a UV
divergence from the field-independent part of the vacuum polarization tensor. This part
corresponds to the right-hand diagram of Fig. 2, but with the loop fermion taken in vacuum,
and according to the LSZ formalism is not to be taken into account in the calculation of the

on-shell amplitude. Using our result (3.23) for the on-shell renormalized one-loop vacuum
polarization tensor in the constant field, and putting things together, we have

as given in (3.20). Note that this contribution, too, after renormalization starts
with terms cubic in F , and that on-shell it has an IR divergence through the pole in (6.2).
A proper treatment of the on-shell limit requires a somewhat different interpretation of
the third diagram, namely as a correction to the tree-level amplitude due to the modified
dispersion relation of the photon in the field [44]. In the presence of an external field, the
physical photon eigenmodes no longer satisfy the vacuum on-shell condition k 2 = 0; instead,
their propagation is governed by the dispersion relation k 2 + Π(k) = 0, where Π denotes
the photon polarization tensor, leading in general to a field induced deviation from k 2 = 0.
The corresponding amplitude for a scalar loop is simply obtained by replacing Π̄βα
spin (k; F )

with Π̄βα
scal (k; F ) in (6.1).

Weak-field expansion of the tadpole contribution

Since phenomenological applications are primarily concerned with the regime of weak external fields, we briefly discuss the tadpole contribution in the limit of a weak magnetic
background,
eB ≪ m2 .
(6.1)
In this regime, the proper-time integrals admit a systematic asymptotic expansion in powers
of the dimensionless ratio eB/m2 .
For definiteness, we present the weak-field expansion only for the spinor loop, since the
scalar case follows by an entirely analogous procedure. To derive this expansion, it is convenient to return to the proper-time representation of the spinor tadpole contribution given
in Eq. (5.6), prior to performing the z-integration. Specializing to D = 4, the hyperbolic
functions appearing in the integrand can be expanded for small
z = eBT ,

(6.2)

which is justified since the proper-time integral is exponentially dominated by values T ∼
1/m2 in the weak-field regime.

Ward identities for the photon-graviton amplitude in a constant field

Finally, let us discuss how the Ward identities work for the photon-graviton amplitude in
a constant field, returning to the off-shell unrenormalized amplitudes. Here there is no
difference between the scalar and spinor-loop cases. It is easy to see that the gauge Ward
identity holds for each of the three contributions separately, i.e.
Γ(irr),(tadpole),(ext) (−k, ϵ0 ; k, δε; F ) = 0 ,

(7.1)

where δεµi = k µ .
For the gravitational Ward identity, defined by the transformation
µ ν
µ ν
δϵµν
0 = k0 ζ0 + ζ0 k0 ,

(7.2)

a slight extension of the manipulations of the appendix of [21] shows that the inclusion of
the one-photon amplitude leads to
Γ(irr) (k0 , δϵ0 ; k, ε; F ) = Γ(k0 + k, ε̃; F ) + Γ(k0 , ε̃F ; k, ε; F ) ,

(7.3)

where on the right-hand side we have now the one- and two-photon amplitudes, and
ε̃µi ≡ κ(kiµ ενi − εµi kiν )ζ0ν = κ(fi · ζ0 )µ ,

ϵ̃µF ≡ −iκ(F · ζ0 )µ .

(7.4)

However, the first term on the right-hand side of (7.3) vanishes when setting k0 = −k.

we can get from (7.3) the following on-shell Ward identity connecting Γspin and Γspin ,
Γ(irr) (−k, δϵ0 ; k, ε; F ) + Γ(ext) (−k, δϵ0 ; k, ε; F ) = 0 ,

(7.6)

while the tadpole contribution on-shell becomes invariant by itself,
Γ(tadpole) (−k, δϵ0 ; k, ε; F ) = 0 ,

(7.7)

as can be easily seen from (5.2) using the on-shell relations k 2 = ε · k = ζ0 · k0 = 0.

Conclusions

In this work we have re-examined electromagnetic photon–graviton conversion in a constant external field within Einstein–Maxwell theory at the one-loop level. Although photon–graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field might eventually find applications in a
broader range of physical contexts, here we have focused on its dichroism aspect, motivated
by the analysis of Ref. [44], which demonstrated that this process provides the leading
Standard Model contribution to magnetic dichroism, despite its small absolute magnitude
under realistic conditions.
Our main result is the identification and explicit evaluation of a non-vanishing tadpole
contribution to the one-loop photon–graviton conversion amplitude, corresponding to the
middle diagram in Fig. 2. Contrary to long-standing assumptions, this diagram does not
vanish once the infrared behavior of the connecting photon propagator is treated correctly
in dimensional regularization. Using the worldline formalism, we have provided a unified
calculation of all one-loop contributions — irreducible, tadpole, and other reducible — for
scalar and spinor loops in a general constant electromagnetic background.
Although the tadpole diagram contributes to the full one-loop amplitude, it is irrelevant
for magnetic dichroism already at a structural level. From (5.6) we see that the magnetic
tadpole contribution depends on the photon and graviton polarizations through a global
factor tr(F ϵ0 f ), which (for on-shell gravitons) is proportional to the tree-level amplitude
Γ(tree) (k0 , ϵ0 ; k, ε; F ) of eq. (1.1), implying identical photon–graviton conversion rates for
the two photon polarizations. Consequently, the magnetic dichroism remains unchanged,
and the analysis of Ahlers et al. [44] is not affected by the presence of the tadpole diagram.
In the weak-field regime eB/m2 ≪ 1, relevant for phenomenological applications, the
tadpole contribution is moreover parametrically suppressed compared to the irreducible
one-loop contribution. In the strong-field limit eB/m2 ≫ 1, the relative importance of different one-loop contributions can change qualitatively, as has been demonstrated in related
contexts [71]. In such regimes, tadpole-type contributions may play a more prominent role
in the overall amplitude, which could be relevant not only from a theoretical standpoint but
also in extensions of the Standard Model involving light or weakly charged particles, such
as mini-charged particles [72], for which strong-field effects can become physically relevant.
Independently of these phenomenological considerations, the inclusion of the tadpole diagram is conceptually important. It completes the one-loop description of photon–graviton
conversion in external fields and clarifies its close connection to other one-particle reducible

– 18 –

effects in background-field QED. Our results thus provide a consistent and complete framework for future studies, including strong-field backgrounds, non-standard charged sectors,
and higher-loop corrections.

in the generic case, it is possible to find a Lorentz system where E and B both point

take them both to point along the positive z-axis, E = (0, 0, E), B = (0, 0, B). The

• The purely magnetic field case:
With the same notations as for the periodic case above, the determinant factor becomes

The worldline correlators (B.35), (B.36) specialize to

• The purely electric field case:
The rules for the transition from the magnetic to the electric field are the same as for
the periodic case above.

• The crossed-field case:
As in the periodic case, for a crossed field the determinant factor becomes unity,
and the worldline correlators are given exactly by their weak-field expansion to order
O(F 2 ), (B.40) and (B.41).
