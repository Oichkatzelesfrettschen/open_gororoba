ABSTRACT

We report a multi-resonant THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor in the working frequency
range of 0.2 to 4THz for the sensing of microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and pesticides. Nearly
100% absorption is realized at f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz. To obtain optimum
performance of the MPA, a mapping of amplitudes and shifts in the absorption resonance peaks with
different structural parameters of the resonators is carried out. Investigations of the effect of the
incidence angle of the THz wave on the absorption spectra of the MPA is also carried out. It is found
that incidence angle does not impact the stability of the lower resonance absorption peak (1.79T Hz). To
better understand the mechanism of MPA, an equivalent circuit model using Advance Design System
(ADS) software is developed. The calculated results through the model show similar trends as obtained in
the simulations using CST. A significant frequency shift in the resonances is obtained with the application
of microorganisms such as Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi), yeast, and pesticides (Imidacloprid, N,
N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt
hydrate, and Dicofol) as testing analytes. The THz MPA-based biosensor has great potential to detect a
very small change in the effective dielectric constant of the MPA environment therefore it can offer huge
opportunities in label-free biosensing for future biomedical applications.



Introduction
Sensors are vital part of modern technology due to their applications in imaging, medicine, food quality
control, agriculture, defence, etc. Food safety and security, two foremost public health concerns1–3 ,
require fast and non-destructive inspection techniques. Due to fingerprints of pesticide and antibiotics in
terahertz (THz) spectral range4, 5 , THz spectroscopy facilitates non-contact, label-free, non-destructive
inspection for food safety and control6–11 . Moreover, the detection of microorganisms such as bacteria,
viruses, and fungi is also very important for food security12 . However, due to the typical size of λ /100,
microorganisms are transparent at THz frequency leading to low scattering cross-section and are difficult
to detect by the THz spectroscopy13 . To overcome this constraint, metamaterial-based THz sensors have
been proposed for the detection of microorganisms like bacteria, yeast, and molds14 , where metamaterial
resonators are designed in such a way that the gap area of resonators becomes compatible with the size of
microorganisms. Here, the resonance frequency of metamaterials is extremely sensitive to any changes
in the dielectric constant of the gap area of the resonator15, 16 . Presently, extensive research is being
carried out to develop metamaterial-based resonant devices such as modulators, sensors, polarization
conversion devices, absorbers, etc.17–19 . Among these devices, metamaterial perfect absorbers (MPAs)
have fascinated worldwide attention due to their excellent performance and their potential applications20, 21 .
    MPAs are able to minimize the reflectivity and transmissivity close to zero. To further expand the
application prospects of MPAs, the number of absorption frequency peaks and workable frequency bands
need to be broadened. Several reports show that flexibility to work in a wide range of frequency band
can be obtained by optimizing the dimensions of MPAs22–28 . Zamzam et. al29 designed an MPA with
a metal-dielectric-metal multi-layer column with different heights of the dielectric layer, where they
achieved two absorption peaks. Wang et. al30 demonstrate a triple-band terahertz metamaterial absorber
at 0.337, 0.496, and 0.718THz where they used three concentric square ring resonators. A metamaterial
absorber consisting of three closed circular ring resonators on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate is
investigated by Abdulkarim et. al31 . The absorption mechanism was comprehensively investigated through
parametric studies, where a Q-factor of 50.72 and a maximum sensitivity of 149.5 GHz/RIU were reported.
Meng et. al demonstrated a multi-band terahertz absorber made of periodic square metallic ribbon with a
T-shaped gap. Several resonator structures like square spiral shape32 , SSRR( square split ring resonator)33 ,
Jerusalem Cross34 , CSRR (Circular split ring resonator)35 , eight-resistive arm cell36 , and Ring C-shape
quasi-MMA37 have been investigated. Most of the reported THz meta-sensors suffer from the limitations
such as larger unit cell size, one or two absorption peaks, low absorption coefficients, and polarization
sensitivity. In this paper, we report a THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor that shows almost
100% absorption in the THz frequency range for fast and non-destructive detection of microorganisms like
molds, yeast cells, fungi, and pesticides. We observe multi-resonant (four) peaks in the frequency range
of 0.1 - 3.8 THz. We carried out detailed simulations to study the sensing performance of the proposed
sensor. A significant frequency shift in the inductive-capacitive resonance is obtained with the application
of microorganisms. A mapping of shifts in the resonance peaks of MPA with structural parameters is
carried out. Multi-resonant MPA-based THz biosensors are remarkably desirable for label-free biosensing
of a family of microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, molds, etc.). The proposed sensor is extremely suitable for
the detection of pesticides because their specific absorption fingerprint lie in the frequency range of 0.1 to
3 THz.


Design and analysis of MPA based sensor
We investigate several metastructures consisting of 1) only one stripe resonator, 2) two stripes resonator,
3) two stripes and one square resonator (SR), 4) two stripes and two SRs, and 5) two stripes and 1 open
book-like resonator (designed from putting two SRs obliquely) on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) substrate
(dielectric constant 12.96) for MPA based sensor (Fig.1). GaAs substrate is selected due to its high band
gap, high breakdown voltage, and better heat & moisture resistivity. A thick gold layer on the lower side
of the substrate as a ground plane is used to suppress the transmission of the THz signal. We select gold
due to its high conductivity, which causes inductance and capacitance to produce resonance at the desired
frequency.
    The highest absorption coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure, where oblique
sheets offer the ability to manipulate the bandwidth of MPA leading to different resonance conditions
and different optical paths for resonances38 . Sensor parameters of an open book-type metastructure
are optimized as: periodicity (P) = 70µ m, substrate thickness (ts ) = 15µ m, width of metal stripes
(ws ) = 4.5µ m, length of metal stripes (Ls ) = 50µ m, gap between the metal stripes (G) = 40µ m, the
thickness of ground metallic plane (tm ) = 0.08µ m, length(L) and width(w) of the open book resonator
= 20µ m and 15µ m, g = 5µ m respectively. A plane electromagnetic wave(THz) polarized along the x-axis
is used to illuminate the proposed device. We applied unit cell boundary conditions in the x- and y-
directions, while the THz beam is incident normally along the z-direction. The schematic of MPA - based
sensor with incident, reflected, and absorbed THz beam is shown in figure 1(f). Simulations are carried

                                                                                                        2/12

                                                                                                  3/12
of THz beam from metamaterial surface (R(ω ) = S11   2 ), a perfect impedance matching with air intrinsic

impedance (Zo ) (where real and imaginary parts of Z(Ω) are close to 1 and 0 respectively) is obtained.
To suppress the transmission of THz wave through MPA to zero, a metallic ground plane on the bottom
                             2 = 0) is used. We obtain four absorption peaks in the frequency range 0.1 to
side of substrate (T (ω ) = S21
3.7T Hz with almost 100% absorptivity. The absorption frequencies are calculated as

      A(ω ) = 1 − (R(ω ) + T (ω ))                                                                       (1)
   We calculate the absorption coefficients of MPA as

                                Zin − Z0 2
      A(ω ) = 1 − R(ω ) = 1 −                                                                         (2)
                                Zin + Z0
    where Zin is the impedance of MPA, which depends on its effective permittivity and permeability. The
effective permittivity and permeability are the function of electric and magnetic responses of MPA at the
resonance frequencies. In terms of S- parameters, Zin is calculated as

                   (1 + S11 )2 + Z0 (1 − S11 )2
     To better understand the absorption behavior, we thoroughly investigate the effect of structural
parameters on the resonance frequencies. 2D colormaps in Fig. 2 show the effect of variation of length
of the stripe (Ls ), the width of the stripes (ws ), width and position of the open book resonator on the
absorption coefficient. The value of Ls is varied from 20µ m to 50µ m as shown in Figure 2(a). Due to
the increase in inductance and capacitance of metallic stripes with an increase in Ls , a redshift in the
resonances are observed with the increase in Ls . The maximum absorption is obtained at Ls = 50µ m.
     The effect of the width of the metal stripe (ws ) (from 4µ m to 10µ m) on the absorption coefficient is
shown in Figure 2(b). The absorption coefficients for all four resonances become unity at ws = 4.5µ m,
which starts decreasing with an increase in ws , which is due to enhancement in the size of metallic
resonators leading to high reflections. We also investigate the effect of the w parameter (width of open
book type SRs from w = 5 − 30µ m) on the absorption performances of the MPA(Figure 2(c)). We obtain
the highest absorption for w = 15µ m without any shift in the resonance frequencies. Figure 2(d) shows
the effect of the length of SRs (for L = 10 to 50µ m) on resonance frequencies and absorption coefficients.
It is found that the absorption coefficient decreases with the increase in the length of the open book due to
high reflections. MPA gives the highest absorption for L = 20µ m and zero absorption for L = 50µ m.

                                                                                                       4/12

Equivalent circuit model of MPA using Advance Design System (ADS)
To better understand the absorption mechanism of the proposed MPA, an equivalent lumped circuit has
been designed using ASD -2019 simulation software (Figure 3), where unit cell of MPA has four resonators
i.e. two metal stripes and two SRs as shown in Figure 1(e). Each resonator behaves as an RLC circuit.
     The inductance of each metallic resonator (L1 , L2 , L3 , & L4 ) is calculated using Grover’s formula39

                                                      

   where l is the length of resonators, w is width of resonators, tm is thickness of resonators. The
capacitance of MPA is calculated using40

    where A, d, εo and εr represent the area of the stripe, capacitive gap between the resonators, permittivity
of free space, and relative permittivity of the medium, respectively. By tuning the capacitance to get
desired resonant frequency, and resistance to increase or decrease the reflection coefficient, we get similar
reflection spectra of MPA as obtained in CST microwave studio suite-based simulations. The reflection
characteristics (S11 ) obtained by ADS perfectly match with simulation results(figure 3(b)&(c)), which
confirms the accuracy of the results.

Results and discussion
Prospects of MPA increase with enhancement in the working frequency band and also with the increase in
number of absorption peaks. We properly optimize the lattice structure (by optimizing the shape and size
of the resonators) of the MPA to enhance working frequency band and also the number of absorption peaks.
We carry out simulations for absorption spectra of the proposed MPA for five different structures for :
(1) one stripe resonator - we get two resonance frequencies with a maximum of 32% absorption, (2) two
stripes resonators- two resonances are obtained but absorption increases up to 50%, (3) two metal stripes
and one square resonator (SR)- we get four absorption peaks, first with 100% absorption, second with 70%
absorption, third with 58% absorption, and fourth with 55% absorption, (4) two metal stripes and two SRs-
we get four absorption peaks, first & second with almost 100% absorption, third with 67% absorption, and
fourth with 42% absorption, and (5) two metal stripes and one open book like resonator between the stripes
–four resonance absorption peaks at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz
are acheived as shown in figure 4(a). The absorption coefficients obtained forthese resonance frequencies
are 99.12%, 99.95%, 98.5%, and 99%, respectively. The high absorption coefficients occur due to the
strong inductive–capacitive coupling between the resonators. The resonators of different sizes own the
ability to produce absorption peaks at specific frequencies and their superposition effect yields perfect
absorption in multiple frequency bands41–43 . Thus, the dimension of the unit cell structure and the shape
of resonators have a vital role in accomplishing absorption near unity.

                                                                                                     6/12

(b) Absorption spectra of the MPA with the different oblique incidence of THz beam..

     We also figure out the effect of incidence angle on the absorption peaks. Absorption spectra with
different angles of incidence of THz wave is shown in Figure 3(b). As the incidence angle increases, the
first resonance absorption peak (1.79THz) is almost stable while higher-order absorption peaks display
deviations. It shows that higher-order absorption peaks are more sensitive to the incidence angle of THz
than the first absorption peak. Thus, the first resonance absorption frequency is a good choice for the
target sensing of microorganisms.
     We investigate the performance of the sensor for different microorganisms such as yeast, pesticides,
and fungi. Experimental data reported by Park et.al14 and theoretical data (obtained using the effective

used for our investigations. Experimentally, Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi) and yeast were grown by
streaking on medium method at 37◦C and deposited on the surface of metamaterial. A conventional photo-
lithography method was used to prepare the metamaterial pattern and THz time-domain spectroscopic
technique was used to characterize the samples14 . The measured values of the dielectric constants were

                                                                                                       7/12
reported between 1.37-1.94 for fungi and 5.38-8.54 for yeast. Experimental findings were examined using
the finite difference time-domain solver. The absorption patterns for Penicillium chrysogenum(fungai)
and yeast are shown in Figure 5(a). The respective frequency shifts of 70GHz and 103GHz are observed
for Penicillium chrysogenum and yeast. Due to large dielectric constant of yeast, redistribution of the
resonance of electric and magnetic fields leading to a strong modulation of the absorption peak provides
larger resonance shift. The traits of the sensed microorganism can be obtained by calculating the frequency
shift of the absorption peaks.
    We also study the sensing performance for several pesticides like Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate
sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol. For
this purpose, we use the experimental values of refractive indices reported by Maeng et. al5 . The measured
refractive index(RI) of Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide,
N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol are shown in Table 1. The absorption vs
frequency spectra of all pesticides is shown in Figure 5(b). A redshift of resonance frequencies by 70GHz
is observed in presence of pesticides.

    To gain deep insight into the physical mechanism behind the absorption of MPA, we studied the surface
current distribution on the top and bottom metallic layers of the unit cell at resonance conditions. Figure.
6(a1-d1) & (a2-d2) show the surface current distribution of the top and the bottom layers, respectively.
Antiparallel currents form a current loop leading to the excitation of the magnetic dipole resonance44 .
The surface currents on both metallic layers are flowing in opposite directions at resonance (Fig. 6),
which generates the magnetic flux coupling with the incident H-field. The antiparallel direction of surface
currents on the top and bottom layers of MPA validates that the absorption peaks are caused by magnetic
resonance responses. Therefore, the stronger absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of
multiple high-order magnetic resonances.

Conclusion
We develop a novel THz MPA-based sensor for sensing of biological analytes. The highest absorp-
tion coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure. Four resonance absorption peaks
at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz having absorption coefficients
99.12%, 99.95%, 98.5%, and 99%, respectively are obtained.We also study the absorption spectra of the
MPA with different oblique incidences of THz wave and found that lower resonance absorption peak
(1.79T Hz) is almost stable while higher absorption peaks show deviations. The effect of structural
parameters(length and width of metal stripes and book resonator) on the resonance frequencies is analysed
to get the optimum performance of the MPA. To gain deep insight into the mechanism of MPA, an
equivalent circuit model is developed using Advance Design System (ADS) software. Surface current
distribution depicts that strong absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of multiple high - order
resonances.Due to the change in the effective dielectric constant of MPA environment with the deposition
of microorganisms, significant redshifts in the resonance peaks (redshift of 103GHz for yeast, redshift
of 70GHz for fungi) are observed. These shifts in resonance frequencies are due to the redistribution of
the resonance electric and magnetic fields, which lead to a strong modulation of the absorption. Thus, by
functionalizing the substrates with antibodies a selective detection of microorganisms is also plausible.
We believe that this MPA-based THz biosensor can open up new opportunities for obtaining dielectric
information of microorganisms, which has great potential in label-free biosensing for future biomedical
applications.

Methods
We have used commercial software CST Microwave studio suite to design and simulate our MM unit cell.
In the x – and y – directions, unit cell boundary conditions are applied and in z-direction, open add space
is employed to obtain the absorption behavior of the unit cell with adaptive tetrahedral messing. THz
radiation is incident normally on the structure with an electric field along the x- direction. A field monitor
is applied at the resonant frequency to obtain electric field and surface current distribution. Additionally,
advanced design system(ADS -2019) software is used to design equivalent circuit of MPA using to analysis
its functioning. In our simulation, we chose GaAs as a substrate with a dielectric constant of 12.94 and
loss tangent of 0.006, and gold as a metal for resonator16 .
