(Dated: September 22, 2025)
Understanding whether cosmic acceleration arises from a cosmological constant or a dynamical
component is a central goal of cosmology, and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
enables stringent tests with high-precision distance measurements. We analyze baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2), combined
with Type Ia supernovae and a cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior. With the larger
statistical power and wider redshift coverage of DR2, the preference for dynamical dark energy does
not diminish relative to DR1. Using both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric approaches with a Horndeski-motivated correlation prior, we find that the dark-energy equation of
state w(z) varies with redshift. BAO data alone yield modest constraints, but in combination with
independent supernova compilations and the CMB prior they strengthen the evidence for dynamics.
Bayesian model comparison shows moderate support for departures from ΛCDM when multiple
degrees of freedom in w(z) are allowed, corresponding to ≈ 3σ tension with ΛCDM (and higher
for some data sets). Despite methodological differences, our results are consistent with companion
DESI papers, underscoring the complementarity of approaches. Possible systematics remain under
study; forthcoming DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB data will provide decisive tests.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most enduring puzzles in modern cosmology
is the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The impetus for introducing an additional component beyond ordinary matter first arose in the 1980s, when early cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy calculations
showed that a low-density open model would conflict with

3
small-scale CMB observations. Subsequently, large-scale
clustering analyses [1] and baryon-fraction arguments [2]
made it clear that a Universe consisting solely of criticaldensity dark matter was untenable, prompting the emergence of a cosmological constant (Λ) as the leading explanation. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) then
provided direct evidence for an accelerating cosmic expansion [3, 4], and by the turn of the millennium, the
ΛCDM framework was firmly established as the consensus model of cosmology. This paradigm has been continuously supported by increasingly precise CMB measurements [5] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data [6],
solidifying its status as the standard picture of cosmic acceleration.
Despite this consensus, the fundamental cause of cosmic acceleration remains elusive. A widely favored interpretation involves postulating an effective dark energy (DE) component that dominates the current energy
density of the Universe (see [7–9] for reviews). Provided
its sound speed is not too small, DE can be treated as
nearly homogeneous on sub-sound-horizon scales, leaving
its main cosmological signatures determined by its energy
density ρ and pressure P . The equation of state (EoS),
w ≡ P/c2 ρ, serves as a crucial diagnostic: w = −1 corresponds to vacuum energy, while dynamical DE models
allow w to vary with time, as exemplified by quintessence
[10], phantom [11], quintom [12], k-essence [13], Chaplygin gas [14], and holographic dark energy [15]. Subclasses
of these scenarios can be further differentiated by examining their trajectories
in the phase space spanned by

w, dw/d ln a , where a is the cosmic scale factor [16].
Recent observational progress, including supernova
measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [17],
as well as other large SNe compilations such as PantheonPlus [18, 19] and Union [20], high-precision CMB
data from the Planck Collaboration [21], and BAO results
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) eBOSS program [22], has significantly refined our insight into DE.
These complementary probes constrain DE-related parameters with growing precision, thus enhancing our understanding of cosmic acceleration. While combined analyses that integrate all available datasets provide the most
stringent overall limits, it remains instructive to consider
each probe in isolation. Such a modular approach not
only underscores the unique strengths and systematics of
each measurement but also furnishes critical cross-checks,
reinforcing the robustness of DE constraints.
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)’s
Data Release 1 (DR1) [23] and Data Release 2 (DR2)
[24, 25] BAO observations place stringent limits on the
Universe’s background expansion history, achieving a
level of precision on a par with recent SNe surveys. These
include the PantheonPlus compilation of 1,550 spectroscopically confirmed SNe [18, 19], the Union3 compilation
of 2,087 SNe [20], and the five-year Dark Energy Survey
sample (DESY5) [17].
In this paper we probe dark-energy dynamics along two
complementary routes. First, we fit the distance ladder

with a shape-function formalism that makes no explicit
assumption about the equation of state. Secondly, we
carry out a fully Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) in which
a correlation prior derived from the Horndeski gravity
[26] yields an interpretable Bayes factor, recovering the
standard (w0 , wa ) result [27, 28] with two effective degrees of freedom. Although these techniques differ from
the Gaussian-process and (w0 , wa ) analyses presented in
the companion DESI studies [25, 29], all approaches paint
a coherent picture: DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO measurements, together with three different Type Ia supernova
samples, indicate the same mild, oscillatory departure
from a cosmological constant. The convergence of results
across data sets and methodologies strengthens the statistical case for an evolving dark energy component.

II.

A SHAPE-FUNCTION ANALYSIS OF DARK
ENERGY

The shape function S0 (a) illustrates how dark energy
grows relative to matter, and the function S1 (a) reveals whether and how the dark energy pressure changes
with time. Finally, S2 (a)—often referred to as the ‘statefinder’ parameter [30, 31]—encodes both w(a) and its
derivative, making it particularly useful for distinguishing among dark energy models (See Methods for the defination and more details of the shape functions). For
example, a ‘freezing’ quintessence scenario predicts S2 <
−1 [32], whereas barotropic fluid models require S2 > −1
[33]. If S2 crosses the −1 threshold during cosmic evolution, it may indicate that multiple dark energy components dominate at different epochs.
Fig. 1 displays the reconstructed S functions derived
from DESI BAO and three SNe datasets, based on
Eqs. (2)–(5). All panels reveal a systematic deviation
from the ΛCDM baseline, and this pattern of deviation
is consistent across the four datasets, indicating a shared
underlying trend.
A key point is that the DESI DR2 sample uncovers a
stronger dynamical DE signal than DESI DR1. In particular, S0 and S1 both lie systematically above the ΛCDM
expectation in DR2, pointing to a more pronounced departure from a pure cosmological constant. Even more
notably, S2 in DR2 exhibits a sharper crossing behavior
relative to DR1, suggesting that the observed expansion
may not be fully described by standard ΛCDM.
This amplified crossing, coupled with smaller uncertainties, bolsters the case for dark energy possessing
additional internal degrees of freedom. Further reinforcing this conclusion, the DR2-based reconstructions
closely match those obtained from three independent
SNe samples. Their broad consistency indicates that
these deviations probably reflect real dynamical evolution of the dark energy; for this not to be the case,
a number of different systematics would all need to
conspire in the same direction. Although DR2 provides
stronger statistical evidence overall, uncertainties remain

significant at z ≳ 0.5, limiting definitive conclusions
at higher redshifts. Even so, the alignment between
DESI DR2 and SNe data underscores the importance of
forthcoming high-precision measurements for clarifying
the fundamental nature and potential evolution of dark
energy.

III.

EVOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF
STATE

To explore this further, we adopt the commonly used
w0 –wa parameterization [27, 28], in which the dark energy equation of state is written as w(a) = w0 + wa (1 −
a). Here, w0 is the present-day equation-of-state value,
while wa describes how w evolves with redshift. Notably,
ΛCDM is recovered by setting w0 = −1 and wa = 0.
Fitting this model to the data constrains the possible
dynamical nature of dark energy in a simple yet effective manner. Moreover, the w0 –wa approach serves as a
bridge between the shape-function reconstructions and
the fully non-parametric w(z) methods discussed later,

offering an intermediate step toward more general dark
energy modeling.
Fig. 2 shows the inferred constraints on (w0 , wa ) for
different data combinations (See Methods for datasets
and priors used). The left panel corresponds to DESI
DR1, while the right panel presents DR2. Contour colors
indicate various datasets, with inner and outer contours
marking 1σ and 2σ confidence intervals, respectively. We
divide the parameter space into four dark energy models:
Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs, thus w0 > −1 and
w0 +wa > −1) [10], Full Phantom (w < −1 at all epochs,
thus w0 < −1 and w0 + wa < −1) [11], Quintom A
(w > −1 in the past but w < −1 today, thus w0 < −1
and w0 + wa > −1) [12], and Quintom B (w < −1 in the
past but w > −1 today, thus w0 > −1 and w0 +wa < −1)
[12].
Using only DESI DR1 BAO measurements yields constraints that are broadly consistent with ΛCDM, albeit
with mild (∼ 1.5–2σ) hints of departure. Incorporating
supernova data narrows these contours further, indicating a slight preference for dynamical dark energy. A similar pattern emerges from the DR2-only analysis, which
achieves notably tighter constraints than DR1 and favors

on Ωb h2 and a CMB constraint on θ∗ . The parameter space is subdivided according to four dark energy models: Quintom A
(w > −1 in the past and w < −1 today), Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs), Phantom (w < −1 at all epochs), and Quintom
B (w < −1 in the past but w > −1 today). The intersection point of the two dashed lines corresponds to the ΛCDM limit
(w0 , wa ) = (−1, 0).

BAO results, both alone and in combination with three independent Type Ia supernova (SNe) datasets, under two different
approaches: the correlation-prior method (bottom-layered, dark-blue band) and the (w0 , wa ) parameterization (top-layered,
green band). The solid and dashed white lines indicate the best-fit reconstructions of w(z), and the shaded regions are 68%
confidence-level uncertainties. The horizontal dashed line denotes the ΛCDM prediction (w = −1). Panels (B1 –B4 ) mirror these

Fig. 5. Likelihood, prior volume, and evidence as a function of the effective degrees of freedom Neff . Bayesian
evidence peaks at “moderate” support for dynamical w(z) once SNe are included. The strength of this prior is varied by adding
different values of ∆ to its diagonal. For comparison, we show both the analytically estimated ln E (calculated as ln L + ln V )
and the numerically computed values obtained via Polychord. The top panel presents results derived using DESI DR1 BAO
data, while the bottom panel corresponds to DESI DR2. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the
CMB acoustic scale θ∗ are imposed in all cases. The shaded region highlights values of ∆ for which the correlation prior is
affected by the flat prior of the w bins. See texts for further discussion.

7
w0 > −1 with wa < 0, consistent with a Quintom B-like
scenario. Even so, ΛCDM remains viable at ∼ 1.5σ. This
is weaker than the 2.3σ rejection of ΛCDM in [25] from
DESI+CMB, because our CMB prior uses only part of
the information, and also because we have chosen to inflate uncertainties. When DR2 is combined with supernova data, the best-fit values stay in the Quintom B region, pushing the tension with ΛCDM above 2σ, showing
somewhat stronger preference for departure from a simple cosmological constant (see Supplementary Tables 1
and 2 for more details).
To delve deeper into the dynamical nature of dark energy, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) using the correlation-prior framework originally proposed in [34, 35] and subsequently applied in
[36, 37]. In this methodology, w(z) is treated as a free
function, while a correlation prior enforces smoothness
and mitigates flat directions in the likelihood. The correlation prior itself can be motivated by theoretical considerations [38]; here, we adopt the version derived in [38]
from Horndeski theory [26] (See Methods for details of
the reconstruction).
Fig. 3 (white curves and blue bands) illustrates the
best-fit and 68% CL constraints on w(z) obtained from
various data combinations. The upper row corresponds
to DESI DR1 BAO data, and the lower row to DR2.
In each row, the leftmost panel reports BAO-only constraints, while the other panels incorporate additional supernova datasets: PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. In
all cases, w(z) ̸= −1 is clearly indicated. Throughout the
paper, we define the significance (i.e., the signal-to-noise
ratio, SNR) of the reconstructed w(z) deviating from a
specific model wmod via
SNR2 ≡ (w − wmod )T C−1
w (w − wmod ),

(1)

where Cw is the posterior covariance for the w bins. For
the DR1-based reconstructions (panels A1 –A4 ), the SNR
of w ̸= −1 is 2.6, 3.9, 3.9, and 4.2, respectively. Switching to the DR2 dataset yields comparable significance at
2.6, 3.7, 4.3, and 4.5, respectively. It is interesting that
the preference for deviations from ΛCDM when the SNe
samples are included remained strong with the enhanced
statistical power of DESI DR2.
All dataset combinations exhibit a persistent pattern
in w(z): w > −1 at z ≲ 0.2 and w < −1 at z ∼ 0.75,
which is consistent with the results reported in companion DESI papers [25, 29]. Including supernova data
highlights this feature further, revealing pronounced oscillations in w(z). These patterns remain stable and gain
additional significance when DR1 BAO is replaced by
DR2. In fact, oscillatory or non-monotonic w(z) evolution
arises naturally in several classes of dark energy models
– including axion-like quintessence scenarios with periodic potentials [39], interacting dark sector frameworks,
where energy exchange between dark energy and dark
matter can induce transient oscillations in w [40, 41],
and multi-field quintom constructions that allow w(z)
to cross the −1 threshold and back [12, 42]. Crucially,

the oscillatory feature seen in our reconstruction is not
an artifact of any single dataset: it appears consistently
across different Type Ia supernova samples and remains
essentially unchanged when the BAO dataset is upgraded
from DESI DR1 to DR2. This stability across independent data sets and updated observations reinforces the
interpretation that the observed oscillations in w(z) are
a robust physical signal, potentially pointing toward an
underlying dynamical dark energy component consistent
with the aforementioned model classes.
The green bands—reconstructions using the CPL parameterization—track the transition across w = −1 well
and are broadly compatible with the non-parametric results, reinforcing the robustness of these conclusions.
While the significance of w ̸= −1 stems from the reduction in χ2 relative to ΛCDM, fully assessing the fit
also requires determining the effective degrees of freedom
(DoF) in the reconstructed w(z). This step is nontrivial
because the correlation prior couples the w(z) bins. To
address this, we perform a principal component analysis
(PCA) [43] to decorrelate the prior and posterior inverse
covariance matrices of w(z). Further technical details on
the PCA procedure can be found in the Supplementary
Information.
Fig. 4 shows the PCA results for the reconstructed dark
energy equation of state w(z). The left panels (A1 –A4 )
plot the eigenvectors of the first few well-constrained
modes, highlighting their redshift dependence, while the
right panels (B1 –B4 ) display the corresponding eigenvalues λi for different dataset combinations. The PCA
identifies independent modes constrained by the data.
In panel A1 (BAO-only), the first principal component
(PC1) is smooth and relatively featureless, indicating
that BAO data alone primarily constrain a single dominant mode of w(z). By contrast, adding supernova data
(panels A2 –A4 ) produces additional constrained modes;
PC2 and PC3 become more oscillatory, especially at low
redshift, demonstrating that supernova observations significantly improve constraints on the redshift evolution
of w(z). Because the main feature of w(z) is effectively a
linear combination of these three modes, further progress
will come from shrinking the PC1 error bar through improved low-z SN calibration, tightening PC2 and PC3
with denser distance tracers in the 0.3 < z < 0.8 window,
and extending observations to z ≳ 0.8 to assess whether
additional PCs are required.
The right panels show the eigenvalues λi , which quantify the statistical significance of each mode (larger values correspond to tighter constraints). In panel B1 (also
BAO-only), four eigenvalue notably exceeds that of the
correlation prior (green curve). When supernova datasets
are incorporated (panels B2 –B4 ), more modes become
well constrained. Comparing DESI Data Release 1 (DR1;
orange) and Data Release 2 (DR2; blue) eigenvalues reveals that DR2 consistently achieves larger eigenvalues
for the constrained modes, indicating stronger statistical
power in the DR2 sample. This gain is most evident when
supernova data are included, as the gap between the first

8
few eigenvalues of DR1 and DR2 widens, showing that
DR2 improves constraints across multiple modes of w(z).
We further validate these findings by computing the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff numerically with
covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) [44], detailed in the Supplementary Information. The CPCA results align with the PCA, confirming the robustness of
our assessment of how many independent modes of w(z)
are constrained by the data.
We can
P project w(z) onto the PC eigenmodes 1 +
w(z) = i γi ei (z) where the corresponding eigenvalue λi
of the covariance matrix represents the error of the amplitude γi , λi = 1/σ 2 (γi ). Supplementary Table 5 shows
the amplitude of the first five PCs. Considering the case
with DR2 and DR1/DR2 + SNe, the amplitude of the
first PC is positive, indicating that this mode describes
a behavior of w(z) that increases fromP−1 over time.
The improvement in the fits, ∆χ2 = − i [γi /σ(γi )]2 , is
dominated by PC1. Including higher-order PCs, multiple
crossings of w = −1 occur, as we observe in the reconstructed w(z) shown in Fig. 3. In the case of DR2 + SNe,
PC4 gives the second largest contribution to ∆χ2 .
It is the advantage of the Bayesian reconstruction
that the dependence of the reconstructed w(z) on the
correlation prior is explicit. To demonstrate this, we
deliberately change the amplitude of the correlation
prior, A, and impose a stronger prior to avoid possible
overfitting. By tuning A, the effective number of degrees
of freedom Neff can be reduced. In the case of Neff = 2,
the reconstructed w(z) is consistent with the results
that we obtained based on the w0 -wa parametrization as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, with related ∆χ2 shown
in Supplementary Table 6.

IV.

BAYESIAN EVIDENCE AND EVOLUTION

We evaluate the evidence against ΛCDM analytically
and numerically (see Methods for details), as illustrated
in Fig. 5. Consistent with expectations, ln L grows while
ln V decreases monotonically with increasing ∆ (or Neff ),
which reflects the number of modes in w(z) that remain
after applying the correlation prior. The analytic and
numerical evidence estimates typically agree, except in
BAO-only scenarios, where the data are not sufficiently
constraining to maintain Gaussianity in the posterior.
Fig. 5 plots the model evidence and related quantities
versus ∆, with the effective degrees of freedom Neff noted
on the top axis. The top panels show DESI DR1 results, and the bottom panels DESI DR2. We display the
change in log-likelihood ∆ ln L (blue squares), the analytic ∆ ln E (orange circles), the numerical ∆ ln E (red
points), and the change in log-prior volume ∆ ln V (green
diamonds).
The increase in both ∆ ln E and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting w ̸= −1 with larger Neff further supports the idea that adding extra degrees of free-

dom favors a dynamical dark energy interpretation over
a pure cosmological constant. When using BAO data
alone, ∆ ln E remains consistent with zero for all Neff ,
confirming that BAO measurements by themselves offer
limited evidence against ΛCDM. In contrast, once supernova datasets are added, ∆ ln E rises substantially. For
instance, DR1 + DESY5 yields a peak ∆ ln E of 4.1 ± 0.6
(classified as “Moderate” on Jeffreys’ scale [45–47]) at
Neff = 2, increasing to 5.2 ± 0.7 (also “Moderate”) for
DR2 + DESY5 at Neff = 3. A similar pattern emerges
with BAO + Union3: the evidence systematically increases from DR1 to DR2, reaching 3.3 ± 0.7 (“Moderate”) at Neff = 3 for DR2.
By contrast, BAO + PantheonPlus shows weaker evidence, changing only slightly from DR1 to DR2, with
∆ ln E peaking at 1.5±0.6 (“Weak”) in DR1 and 1.4±0.7
(“Weak”) in DR2—consistent with what is seen under
the CPL parameterization. Although the PantheonPlus
dataset alone can show a mild preference for w ̸= −1
(see Supplementary Fig. 2), combining it with BAO data
partially cancels that signal. One possibility is a mild
tension between the PantheonPlus-inferred distance scale
and the BAO-preferred expansion history, pushing the
joint constraints closer to ΛCDM. Further investigation
is needed to determine whether this is attributable to
systematics.
To gauge the strongest possible deviation from w = −1
without overfitting the data, we look at w(z)CDM models with the largest departure from ΛCDM while still
having a positive evidence, ı.e. ∆ ln E ≥ 0. Under this
condition, the significance of w ̸= −1 for BAO + DESY5
reaches 4.1 (DR1) and 4.3 (DR2). For BAO + Union3,
the corresponding values are 3.8 (DR1) and 3.9 (DR2).
Meanwhile, BAO + PantheonPlus yields maximum
SNRs of 3.2 (DR1) and 3.1 (DR2), reinforcing the prior
finding that PantheonPlus offers comparatively weaker
support for w ̸= −1 than either Union3 or DESY5.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

With the start of the DESI survey, we now have access to exceptionally precise BAO measurements, providing a robust tool to probe the nature of dark energy.
In this work, we analyzed DESI DR2 BAO observations
in tandem with complementary cosmic distance indicators— SNe data and the CMB acoustic scale θ∗ —to test
for deviations from the ΛCDM paradigm. Employing a
shape-function approach [48, 49], we derived key observables sensitive to dark energy (DE) and found consistent
evidence for an evolving equation of state w(z) across
multiple, independent datasets.
Building on these findings, we performed a nonparametric Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) by jointly
analyzing DESI BAO, SNe, and CMB data, employing a
correlation prior rooted in Horndeski theory. Our results
exhibit strong statistical support for dynamical dark en-

9
ergy, at a confidence level exceeding 3σ. Rigorous model
selection further indicates that DESI BAO, SNe, and
CMB observations together constrain roughly three independent degrees of freedom (DoFs) without overfitting.
In particular, combining DESI BAO, CMB, and the fiveyear DES supernova sample detects dark energy evolution at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.9, with a Bayesian evidence of 5.2±0.7 in favor of w(z)CDM over ΛCDM when
Neff = 3.
These results suggest that dark energy may not be
described by a simple cosmological constant, favoring a
time-dependent equation of state w(z) instead. Although
earlier work [37] hinted at similar conclusions, this study
provides some of the tightest constraints to date, thanks
in large part to the enhanced statistical power of DESI
DR2 BAO data. Furthermore, adding supernova datasets
significantly boosts sensitivity to potential dark energy
evolution: all three independent SN samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5) show broadly consistent indications of deviations from ΛCDM.
Companion DESI papers [25, 29] investigate the time
evolution of dark energy using complementary methods,
and also report the detection of the dynamical dark energy. The level of significance is generally greater in those
works because the full Planck measurements are used
there, as opposed to the θ∗ information used in this
work. Moreover, the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results find that the time evolution of dark
energy is still favored when replacing the Planck data
with the ACT measurements [50].
Extensive cross-checks indicate that known systematics cannot mimic the oscillatory pattern in Fig. 3.
Photometric offsets and a possible evolution of the
colour–luminosity relation in PantheonPlus can shift
w(z) by about 0.03 at z ≲ 0.4 [19], and the 0.04 mag
low–high-z mismatch removes only a smooth trend in
(w0 , wa ) fits when using the DESY5 SNe sample [51]. For
the BAO analysis, DESI DR1 analyses bound templateand reconstruction-induced BAO shifts to 0.1% [52]. All
of these effects vary smoothly with redshift: they can tilt
or raise the whole w(z) curve but cannot produce the
alternating-sign wiggles we recover. The feature therefore remains most naturally interpreted as evidence for
genuine dark-energy dynamics.
In conclusion, our study finds tentative evidence for departures from ΛCDM using the DESI DR2 data. While
our results favor a dynamical dark energy interpretation, continued observational and theoretical efforts will
be critical in establishing whether these deviations signify new physics or stem from unknown systematics. The
complete DESI sample, with increased statistical depth
and extended redshift coverage, is expected to yield even
stricter constraints on dark energy evolution. Additional
surveys, such as Euclid [53] and the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) [54], will deliver complementary BAO
and large-scale structure measurements, enabling crossvalidation of DESI results. Likewise, next-generation
CMB projects will improve knowledge of early-universe

physics, strengthening the overall dark energy picture.

METHODS

Datasets and priors

DESI at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona
marks a significant step forward in Stage IV large-scale
structure surveys [55, 56]. Designed with a 3.2◦ diameter prime focus corrector [57], DESI deploys 5,000 fibers
[58] via a robotic focal plane assembly [59] to simultaneously measure multiple spectra. These hardware capabilities are bolstered by a high-throughput spectroscopic
data processing pipeline [60] and an efficient operations
plan [61]. Since beginning operations in 2021, DESI has
been gathering high-fidelity spectra for numerous target
classes—Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS; 0.1 < z < 0.4)
[62], Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs; 0.4 < z < 1.1)
[63], Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs; 1.1 < z < 1.6) [64],
Quasars (QSOs; 0.8 < z < 2.1) [65], and the Lyman-α
Forest (1.77 < z < 4.16) [66]. Early data analyses and
survey validation [56, 67] confirmed that DESI satisfies
the performance benchmarks required for a Stage IV survey, advancing our grasp of dark energy’s role in cosmic
expansion [55].
DESI’s DR1 spans observations from May 14, 2021, to
June 14, 2022 [23], and has already yielded new insights
into dark energy by detecting the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signature in galaxy and quasar clustering
[52], as well as in the Lyman-α forest [68]. These results
fit seamlessly with external data [69], paving the way for
more comprehensive analyses that incorporate the full
clustering information from the DESI galaxy sample and
other tracers [70, 71]. The subsequent DR2, covering observations through April 9, 2024 [24, 25], not only encompasses the entirety of DR1 but also extends the redshift
range and statistical reach of the survey. This expanded
dataset offers a critical test of dynamical dark energy: if
dark energy truly evolves over cosmic time, the enriched
DR2 sample could reveal a more pronounced signature.
By comparing DR1 and DR2 results, one can assess both
internal consistency and potential evidence for evolving
dark energy. This paper contributes to a suite of companion analyses that build on the main cosmological results
[25], with related supporting study on dark energy [29]
and neutrino constraints [72].
Our analysis draws upon three categories of measurements: BAO observations from DESI DR1 and DR2
[52, 68], SNe samples from PantheonPlus, Union3, and
the 5-year DES survey (DESY5), and distance constraints from the CMB. Because dark energy chiefly affects the Universe’s background expansion history, and
modeling its perturbations requires additional assumptions, we focus here on background observables. Specifically, we incorporate the DESI DR1/DR2 BAO measurements, SNe luminosity distances, and the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) prior Ωb h2 = 0.02196±0.00063 [73].

10
We also include CMB distance information from Planck
PR4 [74], imposing 100 θ∗ = 1.04098 ± 0.00042, where
θ∗ ≡ r∗ /DM (z∗ ) is the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at recombination r∗ to the transverse comoving distance DM (z∗ ) [21, 69]. The quantity r∗ is computed using
RECFAST [75] within CAMB [76]. As in [69], we inflate the
error bar from [74] (column ‘PR4 12.6’ TTTEEE in Table 5) by 75% to account for potential broadening of θ∗
constraints in extended cosmological models.
Our baseline dataset comprises DESI BAO measurements, the BBN prior on Ωb h2 , and the CMB
acoustic-scale constraint on θ∗ . We then supplement
this baseline with each of the three SNe samples in
turn: ‘DR1(2)+PantheonPlus’, ‘DR1(2)+Union3’, and
‘DR1(2)+DESY5’ for the DES 5-year sample. Each combination is analyzed independently to gauge its impact on
w(z) constraints.

B.

The shape functions of dark energy

Galaxy surveys measure cosmic distances via
(DM /rd , DH /rd ) or DV /rd at specific redshifts, where
DH ≡ c/H with H being the Hubble expansion rate,
and DM the comoving distance. The volume-averaged
1/3
2
distance is defined by DV ≡ z DM
DH
, with z being
the redshift, and rd the sound horizon scale. These
observations constrain the shape of H(z), which is
directly related to dark energy. To link DH and DM , we
adopt the parametrization introduced in [77], providing
an accurate yet general description of cosmic distances
across a wide range of cosmologies:

DM (z)
R = α0 1 + α1 x + α2 x2 + α3 x3 + . . . ,
f
DM (z)

DH (z)
R = β0 1 + β1 x + β2 x2 + β3 x3 + . . . , (2)
f
DH (z)
where the superscript (subscript) ‘f’ denotes quantities evaluated in a fiducial ΛCDM model with ΩM =
0.3153. The normalization factor R ≡ rdf /rd accounts
for discrepancies in the sound horizon scale, and x ≡
f
f
DM
(z)/DM
(zp )−1, where DM denotes the comoving distance and zp is a pivot redshift for the series expansion.
Because DH and DM are interdependent, the coefficients βi follow from αi via

β0 = α0 1 + α1 ,

βi = (i + 1)

αi + αi+1
1 + α1

(i > 0). (3)

To avoid overfitting, the series expansion is truncated
once the uncertainty in any αi exceeds unity. For
DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data, a cutoff at i = 3 (yielding
four α parameters) proves adequate.
Given the values of α, one can construct the following
function [48, 49]:
S(a) ≡ A H 2 (a) a3 = B X(a) a3 + C,

(4)

where A, B, and C are constants, and X(a) ≡
ρDE (a)/ρDE (1) is the normalized dark energy density. Since S(a) shares the same functional form as
ρDE (a)—up to a shift and overall rescaling—this ‘shape
function’ effectively encodes the potential dynamical
properties of dark energy.
Specifically, we define three dimensionless functions
that offer clear diagnostics for dark energy evolution:

their expected values under ΛCDM.
C.

A non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of
dark energy with the Horndeski prior

Within the w(z) cold dark matter (CDM) framework,
w(z) is discretized into N = 29 piecewise-constant segments, w ≡ {w1 , w2 , . . . , wN }, uniformly spaced in scale
factor for z < 2.5. Additionally, an extra ‘wide’ bin
wwide = −1 is assigned for z > 2.5 up to recombination. Allowing wwide to vary left it largely unconstrained
by our data, and it showed minimal correlations with the
other w bins. We therefore fix wwide = −1 for simplicity.
Alongside these wi , we vary several cosmological parameters: ΩM , the current fractional matter density; Ωb h2 ,
the physical baryon density; H0 , the Hubble constant;
and Mb , the absolute SNe magnitude (used only when
supernova data are included).
We place sufficiently broad flat priors on all parameters. Specifically, H0 ∈ [20, 100], ΩM ∈ [0.01, 0.99],
w0 ∈ [−3, 1], wa ∈ [−3, 2], and wi ∈ [−6, 4] (for i =
1, . . . , 29). We explore the resulting parameter space using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
implemented in Cobaya [78]. At each step, we compute a
total χ2 that combines contributions from both the data
and the correlation prior. The prior covariance CΠ is derived from Horndeski-based simulations [38] spanning a
broad parameter space, as investigated in [38]. Specifically, the prior is defined as,
C(a, a′ ) ≡ ⟨[w(a) − wfid (a)][w(a) − wfid (a′ )]⟩
p
=
C(a)C(a′ )R(a, a′ ),

(6)

where C(a) ≡ C(a, a) and R(a, a′ ) is the normalised correlation function thus equals unity for a = a′ . The functional form of the correlation prior used in this work is
taken from [38]:
C(a) = 0.05 + 0.8a2 ,

11
h

1.2
R(a, a′ ) = exp − (|ln a − ln a′ | /0.3)

(7)

The total χ2 minimised in the MCMC process has two
pieces, namely

data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/). The data files
and python scripts used to produce figures in the main
text of this paper are available in a Zenodo repository
[82].

where Dw = w − wfid = (I − S) w and C̃Π

T

as C̃−1
Π ≡ (I − S) CΠ (I − S). Matrices I and S are the
identity matrix and the transformation matrix, respectively, and the fiducial model wfid = Sw is calculated by
taking a local average of 5 neighboring w bins through
the transformation matrix S [35–37, 79]. The factor A
balances the strength between data and prior, and we
set A = 1 as a default to obtain the main result in Fig.
3.
We validate our pipeline using mock datasets generated for four input dark energy models with the same
data covariance matrix for DESI and SNe measurements,
before applying to actual observations. Further technical
details are provided in the Supplementary Information.

D.

The calculation of the Bayesian evidence

For a rigorous test of whether the w(z)CDM model
is preferred over ΛCDM, we evaluate the Bayesian evidence using both PolyChord [80, 81] within Cobaya [78]
and an analytic approximation. Under the assumption
that both prior and posterior distributions are Gaussian,
the evidence E can be computed as [36] lnE
 = lnV +lnL,
where lnV = 12 ln det Cpost − ln det C̃prior . Here, C̃prior
and Cpost are the modified correlation-prior covariance
and the posterior covariance, respectively, and lnL is the
maximum log-likelihood from the data and prior. Because our reconstruction uses a running-average method
to specify the fiducial w(z), C̃prior has zero eigenvalues
that render its volume ill-defined [35, 36] (see Supplementary Information).
To address this, we add a diagonal term ∆−2 to the
prior correlation matrix, interpolating between ΛCDM
(∆ = 0) and a w(z)CDM model in which wfid is unconstrained by the correlation prior. The prior volume is
controlled by ∆ and, for ∆ < 1, it becomes independent
of the flat prior imposed on w in the MCMC analysis.
The parameter ∆ changes the effective number of degrees of freedom, Neff , by controling the strength of the
correlation prior.

The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys consist of three individual and complementary projects: the Dark Energy
Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), the Beijing-Arizona
Sky Survey (BASS), and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS). DECaLS, BASS and MzLS together include data obtained, respectively, at the Blanco telescope, Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, NSF’s
NOIRLab; the Bok telescope, Steward Observatory, University of Arizona; and the Mayall telescope, Kitt Peak
National Observatory, NOIRLab. NOIRLab is operated
by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with
the National Science Foundation. Pipeline processing and
analyses of the data were supported by NOIRLab and
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Legacy Surveys also uses data products from the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE),

Supplementary Fig. 1. Same as Fig. 3 in the main text, but the blue bands show the reconstruction result with 1 (top) and
2 (bottom) effective data modes by using enhanced correlation priors quantified by the A factor. See texts for details.

In order to obtain the data modes without using any correlation prior, we need to set A = 0. However, this makes
the convergence of MCMC chains impractical. To overcome this problem, we use a Wiener filter projection.
Suppose a Fisher matrix of w, denoted as Fdata , can be obtained from a given dataset, and one performs two
−1
MCMC reconstructions to obtain w1 and w2 with two sets of modified prior covariance matrices C̃−1
Π,1 and C̃Π,2 ,
respectively, then the following relation can be derived using the formulism of the Wiener filter projection [35]:

w2 = I + F−1
C̃

(9)
data Π,2
data Π,1 w1
where I is the identity matrix.
In practice, we set A = 0.01 to perform a MCMC reconstruction to obtain Cp (A = 0.01), which is the posterior
covariance matrix of w, then we can obtain Fdata via
−1
Fdata = C−1
p (A = 0.01) − 0.01CΠ .

Supplementary Fig. 2. Reconstructed evolution of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) from SNe, BAO, and
combined (SNe+BAO) data. A BBN prior and a CMB measurement of θ∗ are included when BAO measurements are used.
The top row (A1 , A2 , A3 ) uses BAO data from DESI DR1, while the bottom row (B1 , B2 , B3 ) uses BAO data from DESI DR2.
From left to right, the columns show SNe data from PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5, respectively. The blue and red shaded
regions denote the 68% confidence intervals from SNe-only and BAO-only fits, respectively, and the black hatched regions show
the combined SNe+BAO constraints. The black solid line in each panel indicates the best-fit reconstruction for the combined
data. The horizontal dotted line at w = −1 corresponds to the value for a cosmological constant.
−1
The MCMC also returns the reconstructed w, denoted as wA=0.01 . Given Fdata , w1 = wA=0.01 and C̃−1
Π,1 = 0.01CΠ ,
one can in principle reconstruct w for another modified correlation prior by a Wiener filter projection using Eq. (9).
One interesting special case is the reconstruction w from data alone, without using any correlation prior. This is
−1
straightforward since wdata can be found by setting C̃−1
Π,2 = 0, and the covariance matrix for wdata is simply Fdata .

PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA)

PCA is a widely used tool in cosmology to find uncorrelated eigenmodes by diagonalising the associated (inverse)
covariance matrix. Specifically,
F = WT ΛW ,

(11)

where F is the inverse covariance matrix, W is the decorrelation matrix whose rows are the eigenvectors ei (z), and
Λ is a diagonal matrix storing the eigenvalues λi [43]. In this work, we apply PCA for Fdata and C̃−1
Π , respectively,
and show the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Fig. 4.
3.

COVARIANT PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (CPCA)

CPCA is a variant of PCA with nice features. It allows for finding eigenmodes for both the prior and posterior,
therefore it is much easier to quantify the effective degrees of freedom in the system, especially when the prior is
complex.

Supplementary Fig. 3. Ratio of the eigenvalues from the prior covariance matrix (CΠ ) to those from the posterior covariance
matrix (Cp ) plotted against the covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) mode number. Each panel corresponds to a
different data combination: Top left: BAO alone, Top right: BAO + PantheonPlus, Bottom left: BAO + Union3, and Bottom
right: BAO + DESY5. Blue squares represent DESI DR2, while orange circles represent DESI DR1. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗ are imposed in all cases. Modes for which Cp has smaller
eigenvalues than CΠ indicate tighter data constraints relative to the prior.

Unlike PCA, the CPCA decomposition is as in [44]:
CΠ Ψ = Cp ΨL ,

(12)

where the decomposition matrix Ψ and the diagonal matrix L store the CPCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues, respectively. The CPCA decomposition, Eq. (12), yields
ΨT Cp Ψ = I,
ΨT CΠ Ψ = L.

(13)

A ratio of eigenvalues of the prior and posterior matrices, presented in Supplementary Fig. 3, shows how informative
the posterior modes are against the prior modes, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff , can be calculated
as

Neff = N − Tr C−1
(14)
Π Cp ,
where N is the number of nominal parameters. The trace of the diagonal ‘improvement’ matrix L, denoted as
T ≡ Tr(L), quantifies the constraining power, and thus is a useful metric for a comparison among different datasets.
Supplementary Table 4 shows Neff , T and the significance of deviation of w(z)CDM model from three models (in
terms of the improved χ2 ) as illustrated in the table. Results are shown for four datasets.
