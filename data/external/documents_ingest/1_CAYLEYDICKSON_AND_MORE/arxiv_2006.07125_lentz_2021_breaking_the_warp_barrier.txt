Abstract. Solitons in space–time capable of transporting time-like observers at
superluminal speeds have long been tied to violations of the weak, strong, and dominant
energy conditions of general relativity. The negative-energy sources required for these
solitons must be created through energy-intensive uncertainty principle processes as
no such classical source is known in particle physics. This paper overcomes this barrier
by constructing a class of soliton solutions that are capable of superluminal motion
and sourced by purely positive energy densities. The solitons are also shown to be
capable of being sourced from the stress-energy of a conducting plasma and classical
electromagnetic fields. This is the first example of hyper-fast solitons resulting from
known and familiar sources, reopening the discussion of superluminal mechanisms
rooted in conventional physics.

1. Introduction
Hyper-fast solitons within modern theories of gravity have been a topic of energetic
speculation in recent decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
One of the most prominent critiques of compact mechanisms of superluminal motion
within general relativity is that the geometry must largely be sourced from a form of
negative energy density, though there are no such known macroscopic sources in particle
physics. Other concerns include difficulties associated with constructing a soliton
from a nearly flat space–time up to the superluminal phase, where the transported
central observers become surrounded by a horizon, and the equal difficulties of evolving
from the superluminal phase back the flat space–time. Challenges associated with
creating horizons also include communication between inside and outside observers
through the soliton shell, bombardment of the inside observers by Hawking radiation,
and stress-energy buildup on the leading horizon. Further, creating a self-sustaining
Alcubierre-type superluminal soliton [1] of 100 m radius would need an immense
amount of (magnitude) energy, in excess of the scale that is in the visible universe,
Etot ∼ −6 × 1062 vs /c kg mass equivalent [3], though some progress has been made in

Breaking the Warp Barrier

this area, reducing the required energy to ∼ −1030 vs /c kg mass equivalent [7, 16], and
even down to the kilogram and gram scale [19].
This paper addresses the first critique by constructing a new class of hyper-fast
soliton solutions within general relativity that are sourced purely from positive energy
densities, thus removing the need for exotic negative-energy-density sources. This is
made possible through considering hyperbolic relations between components of the
space–time metric’s shift vector, which depart from the elliptic or linear relations that
limited solitons in the previous literature to require negative energies. Further, the
stress-energy sourcing these solutions fits the form of a classical electronic plasma,
placing superluminal phenomena into the purview of known physics. The remainder
of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the geometry of these novel
solitons using the ADM formalism [20] and produces the components of the Einstein
equation relevant for the class of solutions; Section 3 introduces the conditions of the
hyperbolically-related shift vectors and the rules for constructing a class of solutions with
everywhere-positive energy density and conventional energy-momentum conditions and
demonstrates these qualities for a family of solutions; Section 4 solves the dynamical
component of the geometry via the Einstein equation trace and derives requirements
for a potential sourcing plasma; and Section 5 discusses the consequences of discovering
a superluminal mechanism driven by known sources and potential avenues for future
study.
2. Solitons in General Relativity
The space–times considered here are decomposed in the “3+1” (ADM) formalism using
a similar convention to that presented in [21], or [22], specifically following the latter’s
sign protocol. The line element of the space–time is cast in the form

ds2 = − N 2 − N i Ni dt2 − 2Ni dxi dt + hij dxi dxj ,

(1)

where the time coordinate t stratifies space–time into space-like hypersurfaces, the space
metric components hij evaluated at t provide the intrinsic geometry of that hypersurface,
and the similarly-evaluated shift vector components N i at t provide the coordinate threevelocity of the hypersurface’s normal. The time-like unit normal one-form is therefore
proportional to the coordinate time element n∗ = N dt, and the unit normal vector n to
the hypersurface has components

Einstein summation notation is used throughout this paper, with Greek indices running
over space–time components and Latin indices over space components. The lowering
of Latin indices is performed using the hypersurface metric h unless otherwise stated.
Natural units G = c = 1 are used. Lastly, the lapse function N is set to unity.

Breaking the Warp Barrier

Central to the computation of the Einstein tensor is the hypersurface extrinsic
curvature, which can be written as the negative covariant derivative of the normal
vector field n, or in terms of coordinate derivatives as
Kij = −


1
∂t hij + N k ∂k hij + ∂i N k hkj + ∂j N k hki .

(3)

The solutions considered here will have hypersurfaces parameterized by flat metrics
under Cartesian coordinates hij = δij , reducing the extrinsic curvature expression to
the symmetric combination of shift vector derivatives. The trivial form of N and h
imply that the Eulerian observers, time-like observers whose motion in space–time is
normal to the hypersurfaces with four-velocity n, are in free fall.
Resolving the behavior of solitons within general relativity begins with a check of
the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions. The weak energy condition
is given by the projection of the Einstein equation onto the hypersurface normal

where the projected stress-energy is to be called the local Eulerian energy density
T µν nµ nν = N 2 T 00 = E.

(5)

The geometric side of the energy constraint equation is divisible into the intrinsic
hypersurface curvature (3) R, and the extrinsic curvature’s trace K = Kii and its
quadratic hypersurface scalar Kji Kij
8πE =


R − Kji Kij + K 2 .

(6)

The contribution of the hypersurface intrinsic curvature vanishes as the space metric h
is flat. The purely geometric portion of the energy condition may then be expanded in
terms of the shift vector components
K 2 − Kji Kij = 2∂x Nx ∂y Ny + 2∂x Nx ∂z Nz + 2∂z Nz ∂y Ny

− (∂x Ny + ∂y Nx )2 − (∂x Nz + ∂z Nx )2 − (∂z Ny + ∂y Nz )2 .

(7)

Note that the last three elements of the above expression are negative definite, while
the first three are of indeterminant type. These first three terms have the potential
to provide the energy function with an island of configurations that satisfy the weak
energy condition. The first task of this work will be to show there exist non-flat compact
moving configurations that have everywhere non-negative energy.
The momentum conditions are implemented here by comparing the mixed
projection local Eulerian momentum density,
Ji = −nα Tiα = N Ti0 ,

(8)

Breaking the Warp Barrier

to the mixed projection of the Einstein tensor, resulting for the considered geometries
in the three conditions
8πJi = ∂j Kij − ∂i K.
(9)
Both the energy and momentum conditions must be satisfied everywhere and will provide
a sense for the stress-energy sources needed to construct the soliton geometries.
The dynamics of the geometry are in general set by the remaining six free
components of the Einstein equation. Several of these degrees have already been made
moot by the choice of a flat h and constant lapse function N . The conditions for positive
energy solutions introduced in the next section will reduce the number of dynamical
geometric degrees of freedom to one, meaning that only a single component of the
dynamical portion of the Einstein equation is needed. The trace condition is a natural
choice, given by
8πTµµ = −R,
(10)
where the space–time Ricci scalar decomposes in this class of space–times to
R = K 2 + Kji Kij + 2Ln K,

(11)

where Ln () is the Lie derivative in the direction of the normal unit vector field.
3. Constructing Positive-Energy Solutions Using a Hyperbolic Shift Vector
Potential
The class of geometries studied here will be characterized by a shift vector potential
function, a real-valued function φ with spatial gradient relating the shift vector
components
Ni = ∂i φ.
(12)
The soliton potentials considered here will be set to a steady state, moving with constant
velocity and allowing the potential to be parameterized by displacement from its moving
center φ(x − xs (t), y − ys (t), z − zs (t)), where ẋs (t) = vx , ẏs (t) = vy , and żs (t) = vz are
the constant velocity components of the soliton.
The potential condition alone is insufficient to produce a positive definite function
of Eqn. 7, and so a relation between all the shift vector components is added. The
most common relations explored in the literature are linear and elliptic. Specifically,
the linear relation (Nx = Ny = 0) of Ref. [1] produced the renowned toroid of negative
energy density about the soliton bubble of Nz , here displayed in Cartesian coordinates,
EAlc =

16π j i

(14)

Parabolic and hyperbolic relations remained to be explored.
The hyperbolic relation is examined here. Specifically, the potential function will
be taken to satisfy a linear wave equation over the spatial coordinates
∂x2 φ + ∂y2 φ −

2 2
∂ φ = ρ,
vh2 z

(15)

√
where vh / 2 is the dimensionless wave front ‘speed’ on the hypersurface, and ρ is the
source function. The positive z-axis is singled out as it will be the principal direction of
travel for the soliton. Therefore, the remainder of this paper will consider only motion
along the z direction, setting vx = vy = 0. The geometric side of the energy condition
can then be rewritten as

It is still not altogether clear what the sign of the energy function is, so two
simplifications are applied for the purpose of demonstration. Assuming that ρ and
φ are both parameterized in the (x, y) coordinates by the l1 norm s = |x| + |y|, the
energy further can be further simplified to a two-coordinate form, here using (z, x),

from which rules may be formed to ensure the energy density is everywhere non-negative.
For instance, the energy function will be non-negative for configurations such that the

local source density and the z-component source density gradient integrated along the
intersecting ‘past’ wave trajectories are of the same sign.
Consider the pentagonal configuration of sources in Fig. 1, illustrated via bi-lateral
s-projection onto the (x, 0, z) plane of a hypersurface, as a demonstration of one such
compact positive energy configuration with net motion vz = vs . The configuration is
such that the spatial wave fronts traveling from the left-most beams create a broad
region of high and level Nz at the center, terminating on the right-most pair of beams of
opposing density, with the remaining sources organized to terminate the stray branches
of the wave cone, Fig. 2. The net hyperbolic source of the soliton is zero. The individual
sources are formed as rhomboids in the 2D projection such that the boundary lines
are angled to be between the trajectories of the hyperbolic wavefront cone and the zconstant plane for the purpose of satisfying the “non-negative energy rule” above. The
perpendicular components of the shift vector are seen to vanish in the central region,
while the parallel component over the same region is also very level but non-zero. The
placid region at the soliton center is nearly tidal-force-free, where Eulerian observers
move along essentially straight lines at vrel = Nz (0) − vo relative to the soliton. This is
in contrast to the volatile boundary where there exist domains in which the shift vector
can be much greater in size and divergent in direction. The net shift vector of the soliton
is found to be zero.
The relation between the soliton velocity is assigned to be consistent with the shift
vector of the soliton’s central region (vs = Nz (0, 0)) as Eulerian observers in the central
region will then travel along time-like curves with proper time rate matching those far
from the soliton, dτ = dt. In this case, the logistics of soliton travel for observers in the
central region reflect those in [1].
The energy density of the soliton is seen to be positive definite in Fig. 3. Each
rhomboid source ρrhom is constructed individually to have everywhere positive energy
density and to have positive energy density in the presence of other sources of ρrhom of
the same size and orientation. One can therefore piece together many other solutions
from these elements of hyperbolic source. The total energy requirements of the positiveenergy solitons closely follow that of Ref. [3] as applied to the Alcubierre solution

of the same magnitude as the estimate of Ref. [3] for an Alcubierre solution of the same
dimensions, but without the uncertainties associated with where one might source the

energy. The estimate for the Alcubierre solution sourced by naturally occurring Casimir
forces is much higher, ∼ −6 × 1062 vs kg, which requires one to reduce the boundary
thickness to a few hundred Planck lengths. However, no such naturality conditions are
known to restrict the stress-energy driving the positive energy solutions. Further, many
soliton solutions have been made since Ref. [1] that drastically improved on the overall
negative energy requirements [7, 10, 19, 16, 17]. Several of these approaches may provide
significant savings in energy for the positive-energy soliton.
The hypersurface volume expansion, calculated here from the extrinsic curvature
trace θ = K, can be found in Fig. 4. The volume expansion of the positive-energy soliton
is complex, containing expansions and contractions on all sides of the central region.
The solution of [1] possesses only one negative expansion lobe at the leading edge of
its soliton and one positive expansion lobe at the trailing edge. The largest values of
θ for the positive-energy soliton coincide with the sources of stress-energy density, in
contrast to the solution of Ref. [1] where the energy density and expansion factor are
maximally separated on the soliton boundary. Further, the largest positive and negative
lobes of θ on the positive-energy soliton are seen to correlate to the negative and positive
hyperbolic sources respectively. Both solutions have net expansion of 0.

each variety is non-static. The multi-species stress-energy source of choice in this paper is
an electric plasma consisting of a massive fluid and electromagnetic fields, the conditions
of which are investigated further in the next section.
4. Soliton-Plasma Dynamics
This section describes the conditions needed for an electrically conducting plasma to act
as source for the positive-energy soliton. The dynamics of the hyperbolic potential φ, or
equivalently the hyperbolic source ρ, can be set by the Einstein equation trace, Eqn. 10.
The Ricci scalar of Eqn. 11 under the conditions of the previous section becomes
R = −16πE + 2θ2 + 16π ((Nz − vs ) ∂z K + 2Nx ∂x K) .

values, limited by the fluid equation of state. The solitons considered here, where the
velocity matches the central shift vector (vs = Nz (0, 0)) has trace that is consistent with
a fluid with equation of state p ≤ ρ, Fig. 5, which is within the physically accepted
range [23].
In addition to supporting the energy, momentum, and trace conditions for steadystate motion, the plasma must satisfy its own conditions. These include the Maxwell
equations for the electric and magnetic fields, the conservation and dynamical equations
for the massive component of the plasma, the pressure equation of state, and the
additional relations between the massive and electric current densities. These conditions
are of sufficient number to determine all the plasma’s degrees, meaning that the
geometric conditions cannot in general be used to dictate the state of media without overconstraining it, as there is only one geometric field and multiple independent geometric
conditions. In addition to the energy and momentum conditions discussed above, causal
contact is often used as a pre-condition for relativistic plasmas, and is frequently checked
using the dominant energy condition. The dominant energy condition is respected by
the sub-luminal solitons so long as the magnitude of the shift vector is less than unity
in all domains (Ni N i < 1). For higher speeds, the soliton begins to form horizons
between its domains and the external vacuum. To further identify a solution of the

more than dozen degrees of freedom of the plasma that satisfy the example soliton, and
to investigate the horizon problems endemic to this and all other known superluminal
solitons, would require computation beyond the scope of this paper. What can be said
here is that the conditions of the plasma are consistent with the soliton geometry. It is
now a matter of finding the right configuration.
5. Conclusions
This paper has demonstrated that there exist superluminal solitons in general
relativity satisfying both the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions for
conventional sources of stress-energy. This is the first known solution of its kind, as
previous superluminal solitons have required large amounts of negative energy. The
positive-energy geometries presented here distinguish themselves from the literature in
that they obey a hyperbolic relation among their shift vector components in the form
of a wave equation on the associated space-like hypersurface, whereas only linear or
elliptic relations had been previously considered. The solitons were further constructed
to contain a central region with minimal tidal forces, where proper time coincides with
asymptotic coordinate time, and any Eulerian observer within the central region would
remain stationary with respect to the soliton. The transport logistics of the presented
positive-energy solitons are similar to the solitons of the Alcubierre solution.
Beyond being the first positive energy solutions of their kind, the presented solitons

Breaking the Warp Barrier

12

appear to be a counter example to claims in the literature that superluminal space–
times must violate the weak energy condition [6, 13]. To contrast the present positiveenergy soliton and the previous proofs, one must realize that the pre-conditions of
these proofs are restricted to geometries with a single fastest causal path. No known
generalizations of the proofs exist to extensive superluminal mechanisms. Previous
superluminal solitons such as the Alcubierre and Natário solutions can be made to
fit this condition as their structures permit a point-like limit of the interior, where
the fastest causal path would settle. The example positive-energy, in contrast, must
have non-trivial extent. Similar point-like limits of the positive energy solitons would
collapse the geometry to the Minkowski vacuum, an expected outcome as the shift vector
components are seen to integrate to zero. The positive energy soliton therefore appears
to circumvent the criteria of [6] and [13].
The energy and momentum conditions of the presented positive-energy geometries
were found to conform to a plasma with no net momentum flux. The trace of the
Einstein equation, the single dynamical conditions that determines the hyperbolic shift
vector potential, was used to determine the limits on the plasma equation of state
in lieu of having already set the steady-state velocity of the soliton. The geometric
conditions on the plasma are deferential to the plasma’s own dynamical equations,
which include equations of motion and constitutive relations for both the massive fluid
and the electromagnetic fields. The total energy requirements of the positive-energy
solitons appear to be of the same order as the original Alcubierre soliton under the
same shell-thickness-to-diameter conditions, with the energy for a soliton of modest
radius R = 100 m and shell thickness w = 1 m requiring Etot ∼ (few) × 10−1 M vs /c.
This energy, though still immense, is intriguing as there have been many advances in
reducing the required energy of the negative-energy solitons that may be equally effective
for this new class of solutions. The next challenge is to bring the energy requirements
of the positive-energy soliton to the human technological scale.
Once the energy requirement is lowered, the space–time signatures of positiveenergy solitons may be studied in a laboratory setting using existing or novel methods.
For instance, previous interferometric searches for hyperfast solitons could be recast
to search for the much larger signal of a positive-energy-efficient soliton [17, 24]. The
highly magnetized energetic and diffuse atmospheric plasma of magnetars may also be
a natural place to look for signatures of positive-energy soliton geometries even prior to
advances in energy reduction.
For theory, it is an appealing proposition to incorporate the degrees and dynamics
of the plasma into the geometric computation. One could self-consistently simulate
the creation, propagation, and dismantlement phases of a soliton at both sub- and
superluminal speeds. Other directions include further optimizations of the solutions over
the energy requirements and other trade-offs, the broadening of the soliton geometry
to incorporate a “payload” in the soliton’s central region, and studying the challenges
of horizon formation when transitioning to superluminal speeds. However, developing
models and configurations of the plasma alongside the geometry would in general require

Breaking the Warp Barrier

a large-scale numerical effort. Fortunately, in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy
and high-precision cosmology, there exist a number of numerical relativity codes that are
increasingly capable of describing massive fluids and gauge fields in relativistic space–
time.
