Discovery of suppressed charged-particle production in
ultrarelativistic oxygen-oxygen collisions
The CMS Collaboration*

Abstract
A hot and dense state of nuclear matter, known as the quark-gluon plasma, is created in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei. Highly energetic quarks and gluons, collectively referred to as partons, lose energy as they travel through this matter,
leading to suppressed production of particles with large transverse momenta (pT ).
Conversely, high-pT particle suppression has not been seen in proton-lead collisions,
raising questions regarding the minimum system size required to observe parton energy loss. Oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions examine a region of effective system size
that lies between these two extreme cases. The CMS detector at the CERN LHC has
been used to quantify charged-particle production in inclusive OO collisions for the
first time via measurements of the nuclear modification factor (RAA ). The RAA is derived by comparing particle production to expectations based on proton-proton (pp)
data and has a value of unity in the absence of nuclear effects.
The data for OO and
√
pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy sNN = 5.36 TeV correspond
to integrated luminosities of 6.1 nb−1 and 1.02 pb−1 , respectively. The RAA is below
unity with a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. The data exhibit better
agreement with theoretical models incorporating parton energy loss as compared to
baseline models without energy loss.

In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, a medium consisting of a hot and dense state of nuclear matter with deconfined quarks and gluons, known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is
created [1, 2]. The QGP exhibits many striking properties, including fluid-like collective behavior as well as mass- and flavor-dependent modification of particle production when compared
to expectations based on proton-proton (pp) data [3–8]. Understanding the dynamics of these
phenomena and how they emerge from the underlying theory of the strong force, quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) [9, 10], is a key goal of modern high-energy nuclear physics.
The microscopic structure of the QGP at short length scales, where individual quark and gluon
degrees of freedom are most salient, is experimentally accessible through the examination of
high-momentum scattering processes that can happen concurrently with QGP production [11].
The scattered quarks and gluons, collectively known as partons, can interact with the QGP
and lose energy via collisional and radiative processes [12]. This parton energy loss causes “jet
quenching”, a term used to describe the resulting modification of yields, energies, and spatial
distributions of particles originating from the initial scattered parton [13].
In hadron collider experiments, particles having transverse momentum (pT ) greater than a few
GeV are almost entirely produced via the fragmentation and hadronization of high-energy partons. Thus, high-pT particle spectra are sensitive to parton energy loss effects. Modifications of
these spectra are typically quantified using a ratio between the spectra of interest √
and a baseline
found using pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair ( sNN ). Specifically, the relevant pp spectrum is scaled to account for the larger number of nucleon-nucleon
interactions in a nucleus-nucleus collision. Early measurements of this ratio, known as the nuclear modification factor (RAA ), at the CERN SPS [14, 15], the BNL RHIC [5–8], and the CERN
LHC [16–18] were among the first indications of jet quenching at their respective collision energy scales. √
More recent charged-particle RAA measurements at the LHC using lead (208 Pb)
collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV [19–21] and xenon (129 Xe) collisions at 5.44 TeV [21–23] found
RAA to be in the range of 0.2–0.3 for particles with pT around 8 GeV, indicating significant jet
quenching effects in collisions of heavy nuclei.
In small collision systems, e.g., pp and pPb, observations of QGP-like effects including collectivity [24] and the enhanced production of strange hadrons [25, 26], have prompted questions of whether a small droplet of QGP can be produced in such collisions [27]. However, jet
quenching has not been observed in these systems [28–31], and the pPb RAA is close to unity at
particle pT > 2 GeV [19, 21, 32]. The absence of a jet quenching signal could be attributable to
a lack of QGP production, or alternatively, the very short path length a parton would have to
traverse to exit a QGP droplet. It has been proposed to experimentally test the latter hypothesis using collisions of light nuclei having low nuclear mass number (A). Such collisions will
potentially create a QGP volume in between those of pPb and heavier ion collisions [33]. These
intermediate systems are also less sensitive to initial-state energy density fluctuations that hinder theoretical descriptions of smaller systems [34, 35]. Theoretical models incorporating jet
quenching have predicted charged-particle RAA suppression that should be experimentally accessible, of the order of 25% for A = 16 at LHC energies [33, 36–38].
In 2025, the LHC delivered TeV-scale collisions of 16 O nuclei for the first time. This Letter
presents the first measurement of the pT -differential
cross section of charged-particle produc√
tion in oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions at sNN = 5.36 TeV using data collected by the CMS
experiment. A reference spectrum measured using pp data from 2024 at the same collision energy is also reported. The charged-particle RAA for inclusive OO collisions is then constructed

where σAA (σpp ) is the cross section for charged-particle production in nucleus-nucleus (pp)
collisions. Notably, because the prefactor accounting for the number of nucleons in 16 O is
exact, this formulation does not contain any model-dependent uncertainties, e.g., from
√ Glauber
modeling [39, 40]. The OO data are compared to other collision systems at similar sNN , as well
as predictions from theoretical models. Tabulated results are provided in the HEPData record
for this analysis [41].
A description of the CMS detector and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations used to evaluate
its performance can be found in Appendix A.1. The pp data were collected using a trigger
that only required two coincident colliding bunches in the detector, while the OO data were
collected using a trigger that searched for one or more energy deposits of at least 7 GeV in
either of the forward hadron (HF) calorimeters. The total integrated luminosity utilized was
1.02 ± 0.03 pb−1 for the pp sample and 6.1 ± 0.2 nb−1 for the OO sample. These values are
determined by combining two independent measurements. The first is a preliminary analysis
of van der Meer scan [42, 43] data. A second luminosity determination was conducted using a
method that compares observed Z boson yields to a well-calibrated reference dataset [44]. The
luminosities extracted from both methods are in good agreement with each other.
The average number of interactions per bunch crossing (µ), typically referred to as pileup, was
4.7 and 0.14 for the pp and OO datasets, respectively. While pileup effects are negligible for
OO collisions, the pp data are corrected for pileup effects by repeating the measurement using
subsets taken at different times. These subsets sample µ ranging from 1.0 to 7.6 and are used to
extrapolate to µ ≈ 0. This is a 1.2% correction to the pp and RAA results.
Collision events are required to have at least one primary vertex [45] formed from two tracks
within 15 cm of the detector center in the z direction. Additionally, OO events are required to
produce energy deposits above 13 GeV in one or more detector elements on each side of the HF.
These requirements result in a selection inefficiency below 1% for events producing a charged
particle having pT > 3 GeV and pseudorapidity |η | < 1, and a correction for the remaining inefficiency is applied. Similarly, residual contamination from ultraperipheral events [46] is found
to be negligible for this measurement. Ion beam contamination resulting from electromagnetic
dissociation processes [47] of 16 O was found to be negligible for this analysis by studying the
time-dependence of event activity distributions [48].
The measurements reported here are for charged primary particles, which are defined as all
charged particles having an average proper lifetime cτ > 1 cm. Particles that result from
secondary decays are not considered primary if the parent particle is classified as primary.
Charged particles are examined using the hits they leave in the silicon tracker. Tracks and the
vertices from which they originate are reconstructed using algorithms discussed in Ref. [45].
Tracks must satisfy the “high purity” selection described therein to reduce contamination resulting from spurious tracks not associated with a charged particle, also known as misreconstruction. Only tracks in the ranges |η | < 1 and 3.0 < pT < 103.6 GeV are used. If a track has
pT > 10 GeV, the relative uncertainty in its pT is required to be less than 10%, as determined
by the track fit. The misreconstruction rate of tracks is found to be below 1% in simulation. To
enhance the fraction of tracks that correspond to primary particles, the analysis only considers tracks having a distance of closest approach (DCA) to any primary vertex less than three
times the associated DCA uncertainty in both the x-y plane and z direction. In simulation,

3
contamination effects from secondary particles are around 0.5% after these selections. To facilitate cancellation of reconstruction effects and uncertainties when formulating the RAA observable, identical track reconstruction procedures and selections are applied to both pp and OO
datasets.
The resulting tracking efficiency is evaluated using the PYTHIA [49] generator for pp collisions
and using PYTHIA overlaid with HIJING [50] for OO collisions. For a majority of particles considered (π ± , K ± , p, and p), the efficiency is approximately constant at 90% in both collision
systems. Charged strange baryons (Σ ± , Ξ − , Ω − , and their antiparticles) have lifetimes long
enough to be considered primary particles, but mostly decay before traversing enough of the
tracker to be reconstructed. PYTHIA underestimates the production rates of strange particles in
pp [20] and pPb [26] collisions, resulting in a slight overestimation of the tracking efficiency.
To account for this effect, the relative production rates of different particle types in simulation
are weighted to match those in 7 TeV pp data [51, 52] using a procedure similar to the one
outlined in Ref. [20]. In pp collisions, this reduces the overall charged-particle reconstruction
efficiency calculated using PYTHIA by around 6% at pT = 3 GeV but results in a less than 1%
difference for pT > 8 GeV. For OO collisions, a similar procedure is used with an additional
extrapolation factor, based on control samples in data, that accounts for expected differences
between the OO and pp data. Motivated by measurements [26, 53] indicating that the hadron
composition of an event scales in a universal way with charged-particle density, dNch /dη, this
factor estimates the change of light-hadron production rates with event activity. Specifically,
the particle abundances used to weight the simulation are scaled in a pT -independent manner
from a pp-like working point of dNch /dη = 8 to the measured value for inclusive OO collisions of dNch /dη ≈ 40 [54]. This amounts to an additional 3% correction at pT = 3 GeV which
decreases to below 1% for pT > 10 GeV. To compensate for track reconstruction inefficiencies,
residual track misreconstruction effects, and secondary-track contamination, correction factors
are applied on a track-by-track basis as functions of pT and η.
The uncertainty in the tracking efficiency due to the particle composition weighting procedure has two components. The first is calculated by propagating the experimental uncertainties in the input pp data through the entire procedure. This uncertainty is less than 2.0% for
pT > 10 GeV in the pp and OO cross sections but fully cancels in RAA . The second component
results from the extrapolation procedure used to account for differences between OO and pp
data. This component is calculated by examining two variations: one with no extrapolation and
one where the extrapolation goes to dNch /dη = 100, corresponding to the density expected in
the most head-on OO collisions. This uncertainty, which is only applicable to the OO spectra
and RAA measurements, is 3% at pT = 3 GeV and less than 1% at pT > 10 GeV. The uncertainty caused by potential mismodeling of the tracking efficiency in simulation (other than the
previously discussed differences in the types of particles produced) is evaluated by comparing
the relative reconstruction efficiencies of pions coming from different D 0 meson decays [55] in
13 TeV pp data. This uncertainty is 2.1% for both pp and OO collisions and cancels fully when
calculating RAA . To study the sensitivity of the measurement to secondary-track backgrounds,
the analysis is repeated after changing the DCA selection to require tracks to have less than two
or five times their DCA uncertainty. The maximum of the two variations is taken as a systematic uncertainty and is up to 3.5% in pp and 5.6% in OO collisions. This uncertainty is under
3.5% for RAA because of partial cancellations. The pp pileup correction factor of 1.2% is taken
as an uncertainty for the pp spectrum and RAA measurements. The uncertainty attributed to
bin migration effects caused by finite track pT resolution is less than 1% for the spectra measurements and fully cancels in the RAA measurement. Uncertainties resulting from the luminosity
calibrations are not included in the total systematic uncertainty but are reported as a separate

4
normalization uncertainty that is fully correlated across all pT values probed. Summaries of the
systematic uncertainties as functions of pT are provided in Appendix A.2.

OO (blue squares) collisions. The markers show the average cross section across the entire bin
width, not the cross section value at the center of each bin. Statistical uncertainties are smaller
than the markers.
The charged-particle pT -differential cross sections are reported in Fig. 1. The cross sections are
scaled by 1/(4π pT ) so that they are reported within a Lorentz-invariant phase space. Systematic uncertainties, excluding the luminosity uncertainties, are shown in the lower panel. Both
spectra exhibit roughly power law behavior, which is consistent with previous measurements
of charged-particle spectra at these energies [19, 22, 29, 56, 57].
The solid markers in Fig. 2 display the measured charged-particle RAA for inclusive OO collisions. The RAA shows significant pT dependence, with the lowest pT data having RAA around
0.77. As the probed pT increases, the RAA exhibits a local minimum at around pT = 6 GeV
before increasing to a value consistent with unity at pT values approaching 100 GeV. The RAA
value of 0.69 ± 0.04 (systematic, with negligible statistical uncertainty) at the local minimum
is more than five standard deviations from unity, making this the first definitive observation
of particle suppression in OO collisions. The measurement uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the overall normalization of the OO and pp cross sections arising from the luminosity
determination. For comparison, previous CMS measurements of the inclusive charged-particle

for XeXe data at sNN = 5.44 TeV [22]. The XeXe sample corresponds to the top 80% most
head-on collisions, which is expected to be close to the RAA values for an inclusive event selection. The behavior of the OO RAA , i.e., a downward slope until around 6 GeV followed by
an upward trend approaching unity, is qualitatively similar to that observed in larger collision
systems such as XeXe and PbPb. In those systems, the downward slope at lower pT is typically attributed to the pT -dependence of effects such as Cronin enhancement [58] and radial
flow [59, 60], whereas the magnitude and trend of suppression at higher pT is associated with
the strength of parton energy loss. An ordering with collision system size is apparent, with the
RAA for pPb collisions being above, and for XeXe and PbPb collisions being below the OO data.

level of the nPDF uncertainties, while the inner green band shows scale uncertainties of the calculation. Comparisons to this model with other nPDF choices are shown in Appendix A.3. The

Figure 3: Comparison of the OO RAA measurement to various theoretical predictions [33, 36,
37, 61–69]. Models in the left panels are baselines that do not include parton energy loss, while
models on the right include energy loss. The normalization uncertainty of the measurement is
shown by the band around unity.
ergy loss model using the BDMPS-Z framework [36]. Some suppression of the RAA , particularly
in the range of pT < 20 GeV, can clearly be attributed to the baseline model, but the inclusion of
energy loss effects brings the model closer to the data. The red line in the upper left panel shows
a leading order calculation [37] interfaced with the EPS09 [71] nPDF set. This model predicts a
similar high-pT baseline but is less suppressed at lower pT values as compared to the one using
EPPS21. The red lines in the upper right panel shows the same model combined with the LCPI
energy loss framework [37]. The solid and dashed lines show scenarios where a QGP droplet,
denoted as “mQGP”, is or is not created in pp collisions, respectively. The inclusion of energy
loss effects clearly improves the agreement with the data, with the measurement favoring the
scenario where a QGP droplet is formed in pp collisions. The yellow band in the upper left
panel shows a NLO pQCD model using the EPPS16 [72] nPDF set. Here, the band represents
a 90% confidence interval. Similar high pT behavior is seen as in the other baseline models,
and less suppression is predicted at low pT , as compared to EPPS21. In the upper right panel,
this model is combined with the CLVisc (3+1)D hydrodynamics model [73], and energy loss is
included via the incorporation of a jet transport coefficient q̂ that is determined using Bayesian
inference techniques [61]. The uncertainty band illustrates the 90% confidence interval resulting from variations in q̂. This model seems to qualitatively capture the shape of the data but
predicts a smaller suppression magnitude. The purple and gray bands show models that do
not include nPDF effects, i.e., the baseline without energy loss is equal to unity. The purple
band illustrates a prediction from the CUJET/CIBJET model [62, 63], which combines viscous

7
hydrodynamics with a DGLV theory of energy loss [74, 75]. The uncertainty band reflects variations in the strong coupling constant used. This model predicts a stronger suppression than
what is observed. A similar model utilizing DGLV radiative energy loss combined with collisional energy loss and an additional short path length correction (SPLC) for small systems is
shown by the gray band [68]. The uncertainty reflects variations induced by the choice of the
cutoff momentum scales used. The central values give smaller RAA compared to data, but the
two are largely consistent within uncertainties for pT > 20 GeV.
The lower row of panels in Fig. 3 shows additional comparisons. The dark-green band in the
lower left panel shows a baseline calculation without energy loss effects that uses EPPS21. In
the lower right panel, the Hybrid model [64] has been used to add energy loss effects. In this
implementation, the Hybrid model is run using event-by-event hydrodynamics profiles [76].
Although the presence of energy loss effects causes a suppression of the RAA , the predicted
values are still above the data for most of the pT range examined. The orange band in the
lower left panel illustrates a NLO pQCD baseline model [65] interfaced with EPPS21. In the
lower right panel, this model has energy loss effects added by coupling the model to event-byevent hydrodynamics simulations and including coherent energy loss [66, 77–79]. The model is
consistent with the data within the uncertainties, although its central values illustrate a slightly
more pronounced pT -dependence. The dark-yellow band in the lower right panel shows the
JEWEL [67] MC generator which has been interfaced with the T RAJECTUM code [67, 80–82].
The model predicts a larger RAA value as compared to the data, with the values exceeding
unity at high pT . The JEWEL generator is expected to perform better when examining jets
rather than individual hadrons, which could explain this behavior. The pink band in the lower
right panel shows a model that extrapolates from PbPb RAA values using a path length integral
and the temperature profile experienced by partons as they travel through the medium, as
calculated using T RAJECTUM [67, 81–83]. This last model describes the data well.
The comparisons with models reveal conclusions that appear to be independent of the exact details of the model examined. Firstly, the role of nPDFs is clearly important—the oxygen nPDF
alone can potentially cause an RAA suppression up to half of that seen in data. Further nPDF
constraints coming from the recently-collected LHC OO and pO datasets may improve this in
the future. Secondly, models including energy loss effects describe RAA better than baseline
models. Most models capture the pT -dependent shape of RAA for pT > 10 GeV, but a sizable
spread exists in the predicted scale of RAA . Overall, the data are consistent with the presence
of parton energy loss effects in OO collisions, and this measurement places quantitative constraints on models incorporating energy loss in small collision systems.
In summary, we report the first measurement of the charged-particle nuclear modification factor (RAA ) as a function of transverse momentum (pT ) in oxygen-oxygen collisions at a center
of mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV. The RAA is significantly suppressed and reaches
a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. However, RAA rises to become consistent with
unity for pT values approaching 100 GeV. Comparisons with previous measurements of other
collision systems reveal a system-size dependence of RAA suppression in nuclear collisions.
The data are more consistent with theoretical models that incorporate parton energy loss effects as compared to baseline models without energy loss, supporting the hypothesis that a
medium of sufficient size to give rise to observable parton energy loss is created. This measurement constrains models attempting to predict jet quenching in small systems and represents an
important first step towards the realization of a physics program examining collisions of light
nuclei at TeV-scale energies.

Description of the CMS detector

The CMS apparatus [84, 85] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic detector, designed to trigger
on [86–88] and identify electrons, muons, photons, and hadrons [45, 89, 90]. A global “particleflow” algorithm [91] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, combining information provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the crystal electromagnetic and brassscintillator hadron calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with data
from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.
The silicon tracker [92] measures charged particles up to |η | = 3.0 with typical resolutions of
2.0% in pT and 10–75 µm in the transverse impact parameter [93] for nonisolated particles of
1 < pT < 100 GeV. The hadron forward calorimeter uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers
as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m from the interaction
region, one on each end, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |η | < 5.2.
Simulated MC samples are used to evaluate detector performance and calculate correction factors. For pp collisions, the PYTHIA 8.311 event generator [49] with the CP5 tune [94] is employed. To study OO collisions, a PYTHIA event is overlaid with an OO HIJING v1.383 [50] event
to form a composite event containing both a hard scattering process as well as particle production from the underlying event. Potential contamination from ultraperipheral collisions [46] is
studied using STAR LIGHT v3.3.0 [95]. The G EANT 4 [96] program is used to simulate the CMS
detector response. After event generation, an event-by-event weight is used to ensure that the
distribution of the z position of reconstructed primary interaction points in simulation matches
that in data.

A.2

Summaries of the uncertainties

A visual summary of the systematic uncertainties relevant for the spectra measured in this
analysis is shown in Fig. A.1. The integrated luminosity uncertainty is reported as a separate

16
uncertainty and is not included in the total coming from other sources. The non-monotonic
behavior at lower pT values results from propagating the experimental uncertainties of the
input ALICE data used for the particle species correction. Figure A.2 shows a similar summary
for the RAA measurement after correlations between the OO and pp measurements are taken
into account.

Comparison to different nPDF models

Figure A.3 shows the baseline model described in Refs. [33, 69] with three different nPDF hypotheses. The data lie under all three nPDF choices. The EPPS21 model predicts the strongest
nPDF modification of RAA , whereas the nNNPDF3.0 [97] and TUJU21 [98] nPDF sets predict a rather modest suppression effect. TUJU21 currently does not include LHC data having
hadronic final states. These data tend to favor a stronger shadowing of the gluon nPDF, so this
difference could potentially explain why TUJU21 and EPPS21 predict different behavior [99].
EPPS21 and nNNPDF3.0 include similar data in their global fits, but the models predict different A-dependence of nPDF modifications. In particular, nuclear effects tend to be smaller for
low-A nuclei in nNNPDF3.0 as compared to EPPS21 [100].
