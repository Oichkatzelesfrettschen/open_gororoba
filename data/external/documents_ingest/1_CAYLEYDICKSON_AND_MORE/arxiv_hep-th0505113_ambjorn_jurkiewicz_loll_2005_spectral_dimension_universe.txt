                                    We measure the spectral dimension of universes emerging from nonperturbative
                                    quantum gravity, defined through state sums of causal triangulated geometries.
                                    While four-dimensional on large scales, the quantum universe appears two-di-
                                    mensional at short distances. We conclude that quantum gravity may be “self-
                                    renormalizing” at the Planck scale, by virtue of a mechanism of dynamical dimen-
                                    sional reduction.




                                                                               1
Quantum gravity as an ultraviolet regulator?
A shared hope of researchers in otherwise disparate approaches to quantum grav-
ity is that the microstructure of space and time may provide a physical regulator
for the ultraviolet infinities encountered in perturbative quantum field theory.
The outstanding challenge is to construct a consistent quantum description of
this highly nonperturbative gravitational regime that stands a chance of being
physically correct.
    Slow progress in the quest for quantum gravity has not hindered speculation
on what kind of mechanism may be responsible for resolving the short-distance
singularities. A recurrent idea is the existence of a minimal length scale, often
in terms of a characteristic Planck-scale unit of length in scenarios where the
spacetime at short distances is fundamentally discrete. An example is that of
so-called loop quantum gravity, where the discrete spectra of geometric operators
measuring areas and volumes on a kinematical Hilbert space are often taken
as evidence for fundamental discreteness in nature [1, 2].1 Other quantization
programs for gravity, such as the ambitious causal set approach [4], postulate
fundamental discreteness at the outset.
    The alternative we will advance here is based on new results from an anal-
ysis of the properties of quantum universes generated in the nonperturbative
and background-independent CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) approach
to quantum gravity. As shown in [5, 6], they have a number of appealing macro-
scopic properties: firstly, their scaling behaviour as function of the spacetime
volume is that of genuine isotropic and homogeneous four-dimensional worlds.
Secondly, after integrating out all dynamical variables but the scale factor a(τ )
in the full quantum theory, the correlation function between scale factors at dif-
ferent (proper) times τ is described by the simplest minisuperspace model used
in quantum cosmology.
    We have recently begun an analysis of the microscopic properties of these
quantum spacetimes. As in previous work, their geometry can be probed in a
rather direct manner through Monte Carlo simulations and measurements. At
small scales, it exhibits neither fundamental discreteness nor indication of a min-
imal length scale. Instead, we have found evidence of a fractal structure (see [7],
which also contains a detailed technical account of the numerical set-up). What
we report on in this letter is a most remarkable finding concerning the universes’
spectral dimension, a diffeomorphism-invariant quantity obtained from studying
   1
    Although this may be an attractive scenario, it is quite possible that the discreteness (and
associated finiteness) results of loop quantum gravity will not survive the transition to the
physical sector of the theory, which also solves the Hamiltonian constraint. One may also
question the genericity of the “emergence” of such discreteness, which is a consequence [3] of
the insistence that one-dimensional, unsmeared Wilson-line variables be represented by finite
operators in the quantum theory.

diffusion on the quantum ensemble of geometries. On large scales and within
measuring accuracy, it is equal to four, in agreement with earlier measurements
of the large-scale dimensionality based on the scale factor. Surprisingly, the spec-
tral dimension turns out to be scale-dependent and decreases smoothly from four
to a value of around two as the quantum spacetime is probed at ever smaller dis-
tances. This suggests a picture of physics at the Planck scale which is radically
different from frequently invoked scenarios of fundamental discreteness: through
the dynamical generation of a scale-dependent dimensionality, nonperturbative
quantum gravity provides an effective ultraviolet cut-off through dynamical di-
mensional reduction.

The spectral dimension
A diffusion process on a d-dimensional Euclidean geometry with a fixed, smooth
metric gab (ξ) is governed by the diffusion equation
                           ∂
                             Kg (ξ, ξ0; σ) = ∆g Kg (ξ, ξ0; σ),                      (1)
                          ∂σ
where σ is a fictitious diffusion time, ∆g the Laplace operator corresponding to
gab (ξ) and Kg (ξ, ξ0; σ) the probability density of diffusion from ξ to ξ0 in diffusion
time σ. We will consider processes which are initially peaked at some point ξ0 ,
                                               δ d (ξ − ξ0 )
                           Kg (ξ, ξ0; σ = 0) = p             .                      (2)
                                                   det g(ξ)
A quantity that is easier to measure than Kg in numerical simulations is the
average return probability

                                  Z      p

                p
where V = dd ξ det g(ξ) is the spacetime volume.
           R

   For an infinite flat space, the solution to eq. (1) is simply given by
                                          2
                                      e−dg (ξ,ξ0 )/4σ
                    Kg (ξ, ξ0; σ) =                   ,   gab (ξ) = δab ,           (4)
                                       (4πσ)d/2
where dg (ξ, ξ0) denotes the geodesic distance between ξ and ξ0 . It follows that
√
  σ is an effective measure of the linear spread of the Gaussian at diffusion time
σ. Because of Pg (σ) = 1/σ d/2 in the flat case, we can extract the dimension d of
the manifold by taking the logarithmic derivative,
                                       d log Pg (σ)
                                 −2                 = d,                            (5)
                                          d log σ

                                              3
independent of σ.
    For curved spaces and/or finite volume V one can still use eq. (5) to extract the
dimension, but there will be corrections for sufficiently large σ. For finite volume
in particular, Pg (σ) goes to one for σ ≫ V 2/d since the zero mode of the Laplacian
−∆g will dominate the diffusion in this region. For a given diffusion time σ the
behaviour of Pg (σ) is determined by eigenvalues λn of −∆g with λn ≤ 1/σ, and
the contribution from higher eigenvalues is exponentially suppressed. Like in the
flat case, large σ is related to diffusion which probes spacetime at large scales,
whereas small σ probes short distances.
    We will use the return probability to determine an effective dimensionality
of quantum spacetime, which in our nonperturbative path integral formulation
amounts to studying diffusion on an entire ensemble of curved, Euclidean(ized) ge-
ometries. Since the return probability Pg (σ) in (3) is invariant under reparametri-
zations, one can define the quantum average PV (σ) of Pg (σ) over all equivalence
classes [gab ] of metrics with a given spacetime volume V by

                         1
                           Z                        Z    p
                                       −SE (gab )
              PV (σ) =        D[gab ] e           δ( d4 ξ det g − V ) Pg (σ),     (6)
                        ZV

where SE (gab ) is the (Euclidean) Einstein-Hilbert action of gab (ξ) and ZV the
partition function (path integral) for geometries with fixed volume V .
     It is straightforward to generalize the diffusion process and its associated
probability density to the piecewise linear geometries that appear in the path
integral of CDT [7]. In analogy with the ordinary path integral for a particle,
one would expect that in the continuum limit a typical geometry in the quantum
ensemble is still continuous, but nowhere differentiable; for example, it could be
fractal. In fact, diffusion on fractal structures is well studied in statistical physics
[8], and there the return probability takes the form
                                                   σ 
                                         −DS /2
                             PN (σ) = σ         F           ,                        (7)
                                                   N 2/DS
where N is the “volume” associated with the fractal structure and DS is the
so-called spectral dimension, which is not necessarily an integer. An example
of fractal structures are branched polymers, which generically have a spectral
dimension DS = 4/3 [9, 10].
    For the nonperturbative gravitational path integral defined by CDT, we expect
the same functional form (7), where N now stands for the discrete four-volume,
given in terms of the number of four-simplices of a triangulation. As above in
(5), we can now extract the value of the fractal dimension DS by measuring the
logarithmic derivative,
                                          d log PN (σ)
                            DS (σ) = −2                ,                      (8)

as long as the diffusion time σ is not much larger than N 2/DS . From previous
numerical simulations of 2d quantum gravity in terms of dynamical triangulations
[11, 12, 13] we already know that eq. (8) is not reliable for arbitrary diffusion
times. The observed behaviour of DS (σ) for a given triangulation will typically
exhibit irregularities for the smallest σ, caused by the lattice discretization2 , and
then enter a long and stable regime where the spectral dimension is independent
of σ, before finite-size effects start to dominate and DS (σ) goes to zero.

Measuring the spectral dimension
In the CDT approach, quantum gravity is defined as the continuum limit of a
regularized version of the nonperturbative gravitational path integral [14, 15].
The set of spacetime geometries to be summed over is represented by a class of
causal four-dimensional piecewise flat manifolds (“triangulations”). Every mem-
ber T of the ensemble of simplicial spacetimes can be wick-rotated to a unique
Euclidean piecewise flat geometry, whereupon the path integral assumes the form
of a partition function
                                   X 1
                              Z=           e−SE (T ) ,                       (9)
                                     T
                                       C T

where CT is a combinatorial symmetry factor and SE (T ) the Euclidean Einstein-
Regge action of the triangulation T [15]. All geometries share a global, discrete
version of proper time. In the continuum limit, the CDT time τ becomes propor-
tional to the cosmological proper time of a conventional minisuperspace model
[6].3
    We extract information about the continuum limit of the theory by Monte
Carlo simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of (9). Further details about
the updating moves for the geometry and the numerical set-up can be found in [15]
and [7] respectively. For computer-technical reasons we keep the total spacetime
volume N approximately fixed during simulations. All the results obtained can
be related by an inverse Laplace transform to those for the geometric ensemble
with the volume constraint absent.
    Our measurements of the spectral dimension were performed in the phase of
the statistical model (9) which generates a quantum geometry extended in both
   2
      Often the behaviour of PN (σ) for odd and even numbers of diffusion steps σ will be quite
different for small σ and merge only for σ ≈ 20−30. – The origin of this asymmetry is illustrated
by the (extreme) example of diffusion on a one-dimensional piecewise straight space, where the
return probability simply vanishes for any odd number σ of steps.
    3
      The proper time τ of CDT – although invariantly defined from a geometric point of view
– does not necessarily coincide with a physical time appearing explicitly in the formulation of
physical observables, for example, two-point functions.

space and time, with large-scale four-dimensional scaling properties [5, 7]. As dis-
cussed in [6], the quantum universe we generate is a “bounce” in the Euclidean
sector of the theory. It has a characteristic shape when we plot its three-volume
(equivalently, its scale factor a(τ )) as a function of proper time τ . The universe
starts out with a minimal three-volume, increases to a maximum, and then de-
creases in a symmetric fashion back to a minimal value. As shown in [6], the
underlying dynamics of the scale factor a(τ ) solves the equation of motion of a
simple minisuperspace action for a(τ ), and is that of a bounce, with total Eu-
clidean spacetime volume determined by the volume at which the simulation is
performed. It is on an ensemble of geometries of this type that we made our
measurements. Since we are interested in the bulk properties of the diffusion, we
always started the process from a simplex in the constant-time slice where a(τ ) is
maximal. The simulations to determine the universe’s spacetime spectral dimen-
sion were performed for geometries of proper-time extension t = 80 and a discrete
volume of up to approximately N = 181.000 four-simplices, and the diffusion was
followed for up to σmax = 400 time steps.
    Fig. 1 summarizes our measurements of the spectral dimension DS (σ) at the
maximal spacetime volume, extracted as the logarithmic derivative (8) from a
discrete implementation of the diffusion process. The (envelopes of the) error
bars represent the errors coming from averaging over 400 different measurements
of diffusion processes, performed for independent starting points and statistically
independent configurations T generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. As ob-
served previously in other systems of random geometry, we have found a different
behaviour of DS (σ) for odd and even (discrete) diffusion times σ for small σ (cf.
footnote 2). In order to eliminate this short-distance lattice artifact, we have only
included the region σ ≥ 40 for which the odd and even curves coincide, both in
Fig. 1 and in determining the spectral dimension.
    The data points along the central curve in Fig. 1 represent our best approxima-
tion to DS (σ) in the limit of infinite spacetime volume. Their monotonic increase
as function of σ indicates that we have not yet reached the region where finite-
volume effects dominate (in the form of the constant mode of the Laplacian).
The remarkable feature of the behaviour of the spectral dimension illustrated in
Fig. 1 is that it is qualitatively different from what has been observed in similar
systems up to now, be it in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity with or
without matter [11] or for the spatial hypermanifolds of our present CDT set-
up in four dimensions [7]. In these cases, immediately following the region of
even-odd asymmetry for small σ, DS (σ) stabilizes in a horizontal line, indicat-

ing the presence of a single value DS characterizing the spectral dimension of
the system, independent of the scale at which the diffusion process probes the
geometry.
    Apparently, this is not the case for the spectral spacetime dimension in quan-

DS (σ) changes with the scale probed. In order to quantify this scale dependence
we have attempted a variety of fits in the available data range σ ∈ [40, 400].

                                        −(a−b/c)/2


Our interpretation of eqs. (12) and (13) is that the quantum geometry generated
by CDT does not have a self-similar structure at all distances, but instead has a
scale-dependent spectral dimension which increases continuously from a−b/c to a
with increasing distance.
    Taking into account the variation of a in eq. (10) when using various cuts
[σmin , σmax ] for the range of σ, as well as different weightings of the errors, we
obtain the asymptotic value

                              DS (σ = ∞) = 4.02 ± 0.1,                              (14)

which means that the spectral dimension extracted from the large-σ behaviour
(which probes the long-distance structure of spacetime) is compatible with four.
On the other hand, the “short-distance spectral dimension”, obtained by extrap-
olating eq. (12) to σ → 0 is given by

                              DS (σ = 0) = 1.80 ± 0.25,                             (15)

and thus is compatible with the integer value two.

Discussion
The continuous change of spectral dimension described in this letter constitutes
to our knowledge the first dynamical derivation of a scale-dependent dimension in
full quantum gravity.5 It is natural to conjecture it will provide an effective short-
distance cut-off by which the nonperturbative formulation of quantum gravity
employed here, causal dynamical triangulations, evades the ultraviolet infinities
of perturbative quantum gravity. Contrary to current folklore (see [17] for a
review), this is done without appealing to short-scale discreteness or abandoning
geometric concepts altogether.
    Translating our lattice results to a continuum notation requires a “dimensional
transmutation” to dimensionful quantities, in accordance with the renormaliza-
tion of the lattice theory. Because of the perturbative nonrenormalizability of
gravity, this is expected to be quite subtle. CDT provides a concrete frame-
work for addressing this issue and we will return to it elsewhere. However, since
  5
    In the so-called exact renormalization group approach to Euclidean quantum gravity, a
similar reduction has been observed recently in an Einstein-Hilbert truncation [16].

σ from (1) can be assigned the length dimension two, and since we expect the
short-distance behaviour of the theory to be governed by the continuum gravita-
tional coupling GN , it is tempting to write the continuum version of (10) as
                                   1         1
                        PV (σ) ∼    2
                                                        ,                   (16)
                                   σ 1 + const. · GN /σ

where const. is a constant of order one. The relation (16) describes a universe
whose spectral dimension is four on scales large compared to the Planck scale.
Below this scale, the quantum-gravitational excitations of geometry lead to a
nonperturbative dynamical dimensional reduction to two, a dimensionality where
gravity is known to be renormalizable.
