                                         Abstract: We point out a connection between the emergence of bulk locality in
                                         AdS/CFT and the theory of quantum error correction. Bulk notions such as Bogoliubov
                                         transformations, location in the radial direction, and the holographic entropy bound
                                         all have natural CFT interpretations in the language of quantum error correction. We
                                         also show that the question of whether bulk operator reconstruction works only in
                                         the causal wedge or all the way to the extremal surface is related to the question
                                         of whether or not the quantum error correcting code realized by AdS/CFT is also a
                                         “quantum secret sharing scheme”, and suggest a tensor network calculation that may
                                         settle the issue. Interestingly, the version of quantum error correction which is best
                                         suited to our analysis is the somewhat nonstandard “operator algebra quantum error
                                         correction” of Beny, Kempf, and Kribs. Our proposal gives a precise formulation of
                                         the idea of “subregion-subregion” duality in AdS/CFT, and clarifies the limits of its
                                         validity.

1       Introduction
Almost twenty years after its initial formulation, the AdS/CFT correspondence remains
our best-understood example of a precise theory of quantum gravity. It has shed light
on many deep puzzles in quantum gravity, and has also been of practical use in studying
the dynamics of strongly interacting quantum field theories. One aspect that remains
mysterious, however, is the emergence of approximate bulk locality. Locality near the
boundary is straightforward. In the “extrapolate” version of the AdS/CFT dictionary
we have a simple relation [1, 2]

                                        lim r∆ φ(r, x) = O(x)                                        (1.1)
                                        r→∞

between limiting values of a bulk field φ and a conformal field theory operator O;
this dictionary manifestly respects locality in the x directions since the CFT does.
The radial direction, however, is more subtle. One way to see this is to observe that
naively a local operator in the center of the bulk should commute with every local
operator at the boundary on a fixed time slice containing that bulk operator. This
is not consistent, however, with a standard property of quantum field theory; any
operator that commutes with all local operators at a fixed time must be proportional
to the identity.1 Bulk locality thus cannot be respected within the CFT at the level of
the algebra of operators; we’d then like to know in what sense it is respected.2
     The basic idea of this paper is that bulk locality is a statement about certain
subspaces of states in the CFT. That these subspaces can be large is a consequence
of the large-N properties of the CFT, but the large degree of non-local entanglement
in finite energy states of the CFT also plays an essential role. Our strategy will be to
gradually back away from the r → ∞ limit in equation (1.1) and study how the the
CFT representations of bulk operators spread in spatial support as we do so. On the
    1
      In lattice theories with scalars and fermions coupled to abelian gauge fields this property is essen-
tially obvious in the Hamiltonian formulation. Showing it for non-abelian gauge fields on the lattice
requires more work. In either case the idea is to show that the algebra generated by local operators
on a time-slice acts irreducibly on the Hilbert space; the statement then follows from Schur’s lemma.
In the continuum this idea is called the “time-slice axiom” [3, 4]; for recent rigorous discussions, see,
e.g., [5, 6]. There are actually topological theories where the time-slice axiom is false, for example in
Chern-Simons theory quantized on a topologically nontrivial Riemann surface, but we don’t expect
this loophole to be relevant for CFTs with ordinary gravity duals.
    2
      One subtlety in this argument is that to put the operator at a definite bulk point in a
diffeomorphism-invariant way we need to include “gravitational dressing” that will allow the oper-
ator to not necessarily commute with local operators at the boundary at subleading order in 1/N . We
will discuss this more in section 5, where we will see that this level of non-locality is not enough to
avoid a contradiction between the bulk and boundary algebras.




                                                  –2–
bulk side the tool we will mostly use is the AdS-Rindler reconstruction of bulk fields
introduced in [7] and refined in [8]. We will observe that this construction has several
paradoxical features, which we will illuminate by recasting it on the CFT side in the
language of quantum error correcting codes [9, 10]. This language gives a new, more
general perspective on the issue of bulk reconstruction, and we believe that it is the
natural framework for understanding the idea of “subregion-subregion” duality [11–14].
In particular, the radial direction in the bulk is realized in the CFT as a measure of
how well CFT representations of bulk quantum information are protected from local
erasures. The holographic principle also naturally arises in the guise of the general
statement that there is an upper bound on how much quantum information a given
code can protect from erasures.
     One point that will appear in this analysis is that truncated subalgebras of bulk
observables are of interest; these were also advocated in [15] in the context of describing
the black hole interior. Aspects of our proposal are inspired by their construction, but
here we do not discuss black hole interiors and we are not violating quantum mechanics
[16]. A connection between black holes and quantum error correction was also made in
[17], which is essentially an earlier version of the proposal of [15], but again the context
was different and our work here should be uncontroversial by comparison.
     Before proceeding, let us establish a few conventions used throughout this paper.
We will frequently discuss subspaces and tensor factors of the Hilbert space. When we
say that an operator acts within a subspace we also mean that the same is true for
its hermitian conjugate. If the Hilbert space is a tensor product HE ⊗ HE , for any
operator OE that acts on E we may trivially form an operator IE ⊗ OE that acts on the
entire Hilbert space. We will often drop the identity operator IE and write it simply
as OE . The reader should also keep in mind that the CFT regions A and A that we
will talk about in section 4 unfortunately correspond to E and E respectively in the
language of section 3.

2     Bulk reconstruction and an AdS-Rindler puzzle
2.1   Global AdS reconstruction
We begin by briefly recalling the standard CFT construction of local bulk fields in AdS
[1, 7, 18]. We will first work in global coordinates, where the metric asymptotically has
the form
                                                  dr2
                          ds2 ∼ −(r2 + 1)dt2 + 2       + r2 dΩ2d−1 .                 (2.1)
                                                r +1
The CFT dual to this system lives on Sd−1 × R, with the R being the time direction.
The Hilbert space of states is the set of field configurations on Sd−1 . The idea is then



                                           –3–
to perturbatively construct operators in the CFT which obey the bulk equations of
motion, with the boundary conditions set by the dictionary (1.1). For simplicity we
will assume that all bulk interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of a quantity
N , which will also set the AdS radius in Planck units. At leading order in 1/N , this
procedure results in a straightforward prescription for the CFT representation of a bulk
field φ(x); we simply have
                                   Z
                            φ(x) =         dY K(x; Y )O(Y ),                       (2.2)
                                          Sd−1 ×R

where the integral is over the conformal boundary and K(x, Y ) is a so-called “smearing
function”. The smearing function obeys the bulk wave equation in its x index, and leads
to (1.1) as we take x to the boundary. It can be chosen to only have support when x
and Y are spacelike separated, which we illustrate for AdS3 in the left diagram of figure
1; the point x is represented by a boundary integral over the green region only. In the
case of empty AdS, where we take (2.1) to hold everywhere, explicit representations of
the smearing function can be found in [7, 18].3 1/N corrections can be systematically
included [18, 19], although we won’t really need to discuss them here. At higher orders
in this perturbation theory we will need to confront the problem of defining local
operators in a diffeomorphism invariant theory, but we postpone discussion of this
until section 5.
     It is not obvious from the definition that the operators (2.2) have the expected com-
mutators in the bulk; this has been checked perturbatively within low point correlation
functions in [19], but must eventually break down in states with enough excitations to
avoid a contradiction with the argument in our introduction. We will argue below that,
within the subspace of states that are “perturbatively close” to the vacuum, it breaks
down only at the level of non-perturbatively small corrections.
     Note that once we have a representation of the form (2.2), we can use the CFT
Hamiltonian to re-express all operators on the right hand side in terms of Heisenberg
picture fields on a single Cauchy surface in the CFT, denoted as Σ in figure 1. This
representation is quite nontrivial, in general it involves severely nonlocal and multitrace
operators. It also has the property that if we take x to be near the boundary but
not quite on it, the single-time CFT representation of φ(x) still involves operators
   3
    One subtlety here is that for more general asymptotically AdS backgrounds, we are not aware of a
rigorous argument for the existence of K, even in the distributional sense that we will see we need to
allow in the following subsection. One obvious problem is that x could be behind a horizon, but even
for geometries with no horizons the only precise argument for the existence of K (or more precisely
the existence of the “spacelike Green’s function” it is built from) requires spherical symmetry [18]. We
are not aware of any obstruction to its existence, but it would nonetheless be very interesting to see
a detailed analysis of this somewhat nonstandard problem in partial differential equations.

with support on all of Σ. We might hope to find a representation whose boundary
support shrinks as the operator approaches the boundary, and indeed the AdS-Rindler
representation does exactly this, as we will now explain.

2.2   AdS-Rindler reconstruction
Consider a subregion A of a CFT Cauchy surface Σ. The boundary domain of depen-
dence of A, denoted D[A], is defined as the set of points on the boundary with the
property that every inextendible causal curve, meaning a curve whose tangent vector is
never spacelike and which is not part of a larger curve with this property, that passes
through it must also intersect A. This is illustrated for the boundary of AdS3 in the
right diagram of figure 1, where A is the boundary interval lying between the two ver-
tical hash marks and D[A] is shaded green. For any boundary region R, its bulk causal
future/past J ± [R] is defined as the set of bulk points which can be reached by bulk
causal curves evolving from/to the region R. The causal wedge of a CFT subregion A
[14] (for earlier related definitions see [20]) is defined as

                            WC [A] ≡ J + [D[A]] ∩ J − [D[A]].                       (2.3)

In the right diagram of figure 1, WC [A] roughly lies between the dashed lines and D[A].
The bulk codimension-two surface χA in the figure is the “rim” of the wedge and is
commonly referred to as the causal surface of A [14]; more precisely it is defined as the
part of the intersection of the boundaries of J ± [D[A]] that does not also intersect the

conformal boundary at infinity. χA can also be described as the intersection of the past
and future horizons of D[A].
    A simple example of these definitions is where we take the geometry to be pure
AdSd+1 , Σ = Sd−1 to be the t = 0 slice of the boundary, and A to be one hemisphere of
Σ. In this case WC [A] becomes what is usually referred to as the AdS-Rindler wedge.
A natural set of bulk coordinates on the AdS-Rindler wedge gives a metric with the
form
                                        dρ2

                                      ρ −1
where the coordinate ranges are ρ > 1, x ≥ 0, −∞ < τ < ∞ and the geometry in
parentheses is just the d − 1 dimensional hyperbolic disc. The causal surface χA is
given by the limit ρ → 1 at fixed τ , and A itself is given by ρ → ∞ and τ = 0. We
illustrate this for AdS3 in figure 2. By acting on this example with bulk isometries (or
equivalently boundary conformal transformations), we can arrive at the causal wedge
for any round disc in Σ. The case of AdS3 is especially simple; all connected boundary
regions are intervals and thus can be produced in this way.
     The point then is that the construction of CFT representations of bulk fields in
the previous subsection can also be implemented purely within the causal wedge [7].4
At leading order in 1/N , the claim is that for any φ(x) with x ∈ WC [A], we can again
represent φ(x) via the expression (2.2), but with the Y integral now taken only over
D[A]. This is illustrated for AdS3 in the right diagram in figure 1, where we have
   4
    This has been worked out explicitly only at leading order in 1/N for the case of the AdS-Rindler
wedge, the 1/N corrections should basically be treatable using the same methods as for the global
construction and the existence for more general geometries has the same caveats as before.

Figure 3. Three examples of AdS3 -Rindler reconstruction. Shown here is a top-down view of
a bulk Cauchy slice whose boundary is Σ. On the left, the blue shaded region is the intersection
of this Cauchy slice with the causal wedge for a CFT region A that is the complement of a
small boundary interval around the boundary point Y . In the center we have the point x
lying in the causal wedge of two different CFT regions, A and B. A borders the blue and
green regions, while B borders the green and yellow regions. The black circle segments are
χA , χB , and χA∩B . On the right we have split Σ into a union of three disjoint intervals, A,
B, and C, and the circle segments are χA , χB , and χC .



allowed for a conformal transformation that changes the size of the boundary interval
A. We review more details of this construction in appendix A; the only major subtlety
is that the smearing function K no longer exists as a function and must be understood
as a distribution for integration against CFT expectation values [8] (see also [21] for
some related discussion).
     Thus we see that the AdS-Rindler construction of φ indeed has the property that
if x is close to the boundary, only a small boundary region A localized near x is needed
to be able to reconstruct φ in D(A). Moreover, by making use of the CFT evolution we
can again rewrite the expression (2.2) entirely in terms of nonlocal Heisenberg operators
acting at t = 0, but now they will act only on A.

2.3   Overlapping wedges
The AdS-Rindler construction of bulk fields we have just described has the somewhat
counter-intuitive property that the same bulk field operator φ(x) lies in multiple causal
wedges, and thus can be represented as an operator on distinct regions A, B, . . . in
Σ. One consequence of this is shown in the left diagram of figure 3; for any bulk
field operator φ(x) and any CFT local operator O(Y ) such that x and Y are spacelike
separated, we can choose a causal wedge WC [A] such that O(Y ) lies in the complement
of A in Σ. By CFT locality O(Y ) then must exactly commute with our representation
of φ(x) in that wedge. This is coming dangerously close to contradicting the theorem




                                             –7–
mentioned in the introduction, that is that no nontrivial operator in the CFT can
commute with all local CFT operators on Σ.
     To avoid this contradiction it must be the case that the representations of φ(x) in
different wedges are not really all the same operator on the CFT Hilbert space. We
can see this in another way by considering the setup of the center diagram in figure 3,
where we have two overlapping wedges WC [A] and WC [B] that both contain the point
x but x is not contained in WC [A ∩ B]. For a CFT operator defined with support only
on A to really be equal to a CFT operator defined with support only on B, it must be
that the operator really only has support on A ∩ B. But given that we have chosen x to
lie outside of WC [A ∩ B], we do not expect the operator to have such a representation.
In fact in this example the operator has a representation on the complement of A ∩ B,
and we will see in section (3.5) that when this is so a version of the no-cloning theorem
of quantum mechanics forbids an accurate representation of the operator on A ∩ B.
     We can see the non-equivalence of the operators even more clearly by considering a
third example, shown in the right diagram in figure 3. Now a bulk field at the point x
lies outside of the causal wedge for any one of the regions, but it can be reconstructed
in A ∪ B, B ∪ C, or A ∪ C. The mutual intersection of these regions is just three points,
and if we consider another set of three regions slightly rotated from these we can come
up with a set of six possible reconstructions whose mutual intersection is genuinely
empty. There is simply no possible way that they can all be equal as operators. For
future reference we will refer to the three operators as φAB (x), φBC (x), and φAC (x).
     We thus need to decide how we are to reconcile these operator inequivalences with
the fact that in the bulk theory it seems that the operators are equivalent. There
will clearly be some CFT states where they act quite differently, and we would like to
understand the physics of the subset of states where their action is equivalent. This
problem can be nicely understood in the language of quantum error correction, to which
we now turn.


3       Correcting quantum erasures
Say Alice wants to send Bob a quantum state of k qubits in the mail, but she is worried
that some of the qubits might get lost on the way. Quantum error correction is a
procedure that allows her to embed this state into n > k qubits in such a way that
even if some qubits are lost, Bob can still recover it. In this section we review some
basic facts about this, beginning with an example.5
    5
    Our presentation of quantum error correction is somewhat nonstandard, since we are interested
only correcting for the erasure of a known set of qubits. This allows us to omit many of the usual

3.1     A simple example of erasure correction
The simplest example of quantum error correction actually involves three-state “qutrits”
instead of two-state qubits, and it uses three qutrits to send a single-qutrit message
[25]. Say Alice wishes to send the state
                                                  2
                                                  X
                                          |ψi =         ai |ii.                                 (3.1)
                                                  i=0

The idea is to instead send the state
                                                  2
                                                  X
                                          |ψi
                                           e =          ai |eii,                                (3.2)
                                                  i=0

where
                                     1
                                0i = √ (|000i + |111i + |222i)
                               |e
                                      3
                                     1
                                1i = √ (|012i + |120i + |201i)
                               |e                                                               (3.3)
                                      3
                                     1
                                2i = √ (|021i + |102i + |210i) .
                               |e
                                      3
This protocol has two remarkable properties. First of all for any state |ψi,
                                                                         e the reduced
density matrix on any one of the qutrits is maximally mixed. Thus no single qutrit
can be used to acquire any information about the state. Secondly, from any two of the
qutrits Bob can reconstruct the state. For example, say he has access to only the first
two qutrits. He can make use of the fact that there exists a unitary transformation U12
acting only on the first two qutrits that implements
                                                 1
                        (U12 ⊗ I3 ) |eii = |ii ⊗ √ (|00i + |11i + |22i) .                       (3.4)
                                                  3
Acting with this on the encoded message, we see that Bob can recover the state |ψi:

                                    e = |ψi ⊗ √1 (|00i + |11i + |22i) .
                       (U12 ⊗ I3 ) |ψi                                                          (3.5)
                                                3
Explicitly U12 is a permutation that acts as
                           |00i → |00i |11i → |01i |22i → |02i
                           |01i → |12i |12i → |10i |20i → |11i .                                (3.6)

topics, such as quantum channels, ancilla, check operators, etc. Standard reviews of this more general
formalism are [22, 23]; for a concise description of the basic ideas see section 4 of [24].




                                                –9–
Clearly by the symmetry of (3.3) a similar construction is also possible if Bob has
access only to the second and third, or first and third qutrits. Thus Bob can correct for
the loss of any one of the qutrits; in quantum information terminology one describes
this as a quantum error correcting code that can protect against arbitrary single qutrit
erasures. The subspace spanned by (3.3) is called the code subspace; the entanglement
of the states in the code subspace is essential for the functioning of the protocol.
     In our discussion of reconstruction in the previous section we were interested in the
action of operators rather than the recovery of states, and we can rephrase the error
correction protocol in this language. Indeed, say that O is an operator that acts on the
single qutrit Hilbert space as6
                                           X
                                   O|ii =      (O)ji |ji.                            (3.7)
                                                  j


For any such O we can always find a (non-unique) three-qutrit operator O
                                                                       e which
implements the same transformation on the code subspace:
                                        X
                               O|
                                e eii =   (O)ji |e
                                                 ji.                      (3.8)
                                                  j


In quantum computing language, operators like O  e that act directly on the code subspace
in this manner are called logical operations, since they are the types of things that we
want to implement when performing a fault-tolerant quantum computation.
    For a general code subspace, O e would need to have nontrivial support on all three
qutrits. For the code subspace in question, however, is straightforward to see that the
operator
                                             †
                                    O12 ≡ U12  OU12 ,                                (3.9)
where O is taken to act on the first qutrit, acts as
                                            X
                                 O12 |eii =    (O)ji |e
                                                      ji.                                       (3.10)
                                                      j


O12 is thus an Oe that has support only on the first two qutrits. Since we can also
analogously construct O23 or O13 , we have realized a situation where operators with
nontrivial support on different qutrits have the same action on the code subspace. This
should be reminiscent of our discussion of overlapping wedges in the previous section;
we will make the connection more explicit soon but first we need to discuss some general
properties of quantum erasure correction.
   6
    Here we write (O)ij to indicate the matrix elements of the operator O on the code subspace, with
the parentheses there to distinguish this from the operators O12 , O23 , etc to be defined momentarily.




                                               – 10 –
    Before moving on, however, we want to introduce a notational simplification. So
far we have been careful to distinguish the single-qutrit operator O from its three-qutrit
representations O.
                e We find it convenient, however, to from now on abuse notation by
instead thinking of “O” as an abstract logical operation and using it both cases; which
operator we mean should always be clear from the context. So for example we can
write
                                      O12 |eii = O|eii.                             (3.11)

3.2    General erasure correction
We now describe a natural generalization of the protocol of the previous subsection.
For familiarity we will describe it using qubits, although none of the results rely on
this. Say that we want to protect a k-qubit code subspace of an n-qubit system against
the loss of some collection of E of l of the qubits. We define the code subspace HC as
the span of the orthonormal states

                                 |eii = Uenc |i1 . . . ik 0k+1 . . . 0n i,                    (3.12)

where Uenc is called the encoding unitary transformation. There is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the correctability of the erasure of E [26]. Say that we adjoin
to our system a reference system R of k additional qubits. We then consider the state
                                             X
                                |φi = 2−k/2      |iiR |eiiEE ,                    (3.13)
                                                      i


where E denotes the set of n − l qubits that aren’t erased. The code (3.12) can correct
for the erasure of E if and only if we have

                                    ρRE [φ] = ρR [φ] ⊗ ρE [φ].                                (3.14)

Here ρR [φ], ρE [φ], etc are the reduced density matrices obtained from |φi by partial
trace. This is equivalent to saying that the mutual information IRE = SR + SE −
SRE vanishes, where SX is the Von Neumman entropy, SX ≡ −trρX log ρX . Let us
first see that this ensures we can correct the erasure. The Schmidt decomposition7 of
   7
    The Schmidt decomposition of a pure state |ψi in a bipartite Hilbert space HA ⊗ HB is the
observation that for any |ψi ∈ HA ⊗ HB there exists a set of orthonormal states |iiA in HA , a set of
orthonormal states |iiB in HB , and a set of non-negative real numbers Ci such that
                                               X
                                        |ψi =     Ci |iiA |iiB .                              (3.15)
                                                  i

For a derivation and some more details see for example [27].




                                                 – 11 –
|φi, together with (3.14), ensures us that there exists a basis |ei for E and a set of
orthonormal states |ψi,e iE in E such that
                                        X
                            |φi = 2−k/2    Ce |iiR |eiE |ψi,e iE ,              (3.16)
                                           i,e

where Ce are some non-negative coefficients obeying e Ce2 = 1. In other words there
                                                        P

exists a unitary transformation UE acting only on E such that
                                        X
                         UE |φi = 2−k/2    |iiR |iiE 1 ⊗ |χiE 2 E ,          (3.17)
                                             i

where we have denoted the first k qubits of E as E 1 and the rest as E 2 . |χi is some
state that is independent of i. This then implies that we must have

                                 UE |eiiEE = |iiE 1 ⊗ |χiE 2 E ,                       (3.18)

which is the analogue of (3.4) above and demonstrates that we can use UE to correct
the erasure. If we do not have (3.14), then there is nonzero correlation between R
and E, so we can learn about the state of R by doing measurements on E. Since
any successful protocol must not care about what happens to the qubits we lose, this
prevents us from being able to correct the erasure. We can thus loosely rephrase (3.14)
as the statement that the erasure of E is correctable if and only if no information about
i can be obtained from E. This is related to the no-cloning theorem; if we were able
to get the same quantum information about the encoded state |ψi    e from both E and E
then we would have built a machine for cloning that information.
    There is a useful reformulation of the condition (3.14) as the statement that for
any operator XE acting on E, we must have [28]

                                    hei|XE |e
                                            ji = δij C(X).                             (3.19)

In other words we must have the projection of XE onto the code subspace be propor-
tional to the identity. One immediate consequence of this is that in any state |ψi
                                                                                 e in
the code subspace, the correlation function of XE with any operator O that acts within
the code subspace8 must vanish:

                          hψ|OX
                           e    E |ψi − hψ|O|ψihψ|XE |ψi = 0.
                                   e     e e e        e                                (3.20)

This is another manifestation of the idea that E has no access to the encoded informa-
tion.
  8
   Throughout this paper, when we say that an operator acts within a subspace we mean that the
same is true for its hermitian conjugate as well.




                                            – 12 –
    As in the previous subsection, we can use UE to realize any operator O acting
within the code subspace as an operator OE that acts just on E. Indeed we have both

                                         OE |ψi
                                              e = O|ψi
                                                     e
                                         O† | e
                                           E
                                             ψi = O† | e
                                                      ψi.                                     (3.21)

In fact the converse of this statement also holds; if any operator on the code subspace
can be realized as an operator on E as in (3.21), then the code is able to correct for
the loss of E. The proof is simple. Say that the code were not correctable; then as
just discussed there must exist an operator XE on E where (3.19) does not hold. By
Schur’s lemma, there must then exist an operator O on the code subspace that does
not commute with XE on HC , that is with hei|[O, XE ]|e ji 6= 0 for some i and j. But this
operator O can’t be realized on HC by an operator OE that acts only on E, since any
such operator by definition would commute with XE .
    We now turn to the question of when we should expect (3.14) (or equivalently
(3.19) or (3.21)) to hold. In situations where we would like our code to be able to
correct against a wide variety of erasures, we expect that ρE [φ] will have full rank.9 In
that case, in order to be able to have the orthonormal set of states |ψi,e i we need the
dimensionality of E to be at least as large as dimensionality of RE. In other words we
need
                                       n ≥ 2l + k.                                  (3.22)
This condition is quite intuitive; wanting to send a larger message or correct larger
erasures requires more qubits.
     In fact for large systems (3.22) is typically not only necessary but sufficient. Say we
take |φi to be a random state of 2k+n qubits in the Haar measure. By Page’s theorem
[29]10 , the density matrix of R will be exponentially close to maximally mixed provided
that n−k  1, so by the Schmidt decomposition this is equivalent to choosing a random
k-qubit code subspace of n qubits. The condition (3.14) will hold if RE is maximally
mixed, which again by Page’s theorem should be true provided that n − 2l − k  1.
Thus, not only is (3.22) necessary for a typical code to correct for the loss of a particular
set E of l qubits, it is basically sufficient for the code to correct for the loss of any set
of l qubits.
   9
      This excludes trivial cases like Uenc = 1 with E chosen to be the last n − k qubits. This code
is completely defeated by erasing any of the first k qubits, and if we knew that erasures would only
affect the last n − k qubits why would we include those qubits at all?
   10
      Page’s theorem is the statement that a random state of a bipartite Hilbert space HA ⊗ HB will
be maximally mixed on the smaller factor up to corrections that go like the ratio of dimension of the
smaller factor to the dimension of the larger factor. For more details see e.g. [27].

3.3   Quantum secret sharing
The three-qutrit example of section 3.1 has the interesting property that every collection
of qutrits either can perfectly reconstruct the state |ψi or has no information about
it at all. General error correcting codes do not have this property, since sometimes
we can have erasures which can be “partially corrected”, but it is interesting to think
about the codes that do. Say that we have a Hilbert space that is a tensor product of
p factors of not necessarily equal size, which in this context we will refer to as shares.
A code subspace C of this Hilbert space is called a Quantum Secret Sharing Scheme
if it has the property that every collection of shares either can distinguish perfectly
different elements of C, meaning given access to it we can correct for the erasure of its
complement, or it cannot distinguish different elements at all [25]. Collections which
enable erasure correction are called authorized and collections which do not are called
unauthorized. We will see a possible application of quantum secret sharing to AdS/CFT
in section 4.3 below.

3.4   Approximate erasure correction
So far we have discussed exact quantum error correction, but in AdS/CFT we only
expect the emergence of the bulk to be approximate. It will thus be important for us
to get a sense of how badly we might want to allow our three necessary and sufficient
conditions for correctability to be violated. The simplest way to relax the condition
(3.14) is to require only [30]

                                ||ρRE − ρR ⊗ ρE ||1  1.                           (3.23)
                  √
Here ||M ||1 ≡ tr M † M is the trace norm of M ; two density matrices whose difference
has trace norm  are “operationally close” in the sense that the probability distributions
they predict for arbitrary measurements differ by at most . This essentially says that
typical states in the code subspace can be reconstructed to accuracy ; following [30] we
take this to be the definition of approximate error correction. We would like to relate
this to our second condition for correctability, (3.19), but we need a convenient way to
quantify the violation of (3.19). One good choice is to use correlation functions of the
form
                     T               T
                                                           T                    
   Cφ (O, XE ) ≡ hφ|OR XE |φi − hφ|OR  |φihφ|XE |φi = trRE OR XE (ρRE − ρR ⊗ ρE ) .
                                                                                (3.24)
        T
Here OR denotes taking the transpose of an operator O on the code subspace and
acting with it on the reference system R; by construction acting on the state |φi this
is equivalent to acting with O on EE. Cφ (O, XE ) is essentially the average of the



                                         – 14 –
correlation function (3.20) over all | e
                                      ψi ∈ HC ; they become equal in the limit of a large
               11
code subspace. From the right hand side of (3.24) it is not difficult to show that [31]
                                                   Cφ (O, XE )
                              ||ρRE − ρR ⊗ ρE ||1 ≥            ,                 (3.25)
                                                     λO λX
where λO and λX are the largest eigenvalues of their respective operators. Thus we see
that, as one might expect from our discussion around (3.19), the presence of nonzero
correlation between O and XE puts a limit on how accurately we can correct for the era-
sure of E. This inequality will be very useful in our discussion of AdS/CFT, since after
all computing correlation functions in the bulk theory is much easier than computing
the trace norm directly.

3.5    Operator algebra quantum error correction
In our discussion of AdS/CFT we will soon see that the presence of bulk correlation puts
nontrivial restrictions on the correctability of errors via the inequality (3.25). There
is, however, a generalized version of quantum error correction, called operator algebra
quantum error correction, that is able to accommodate such correlation by requiring
that our third necessary and sufficient condition (3.21) apply only to a subalgebra of
operators on the code subspace [32, 33]. This requirement is greatly illuminated by the
following theorem:
Theorem. Say that we have a code subspace HC ⊂ HE ⊗ HE and an operator O that,
together with its hermitian conjugate, acts within the code subspace. In other words we
have
                                           X
                                   O|eii =     Oji |e
                                                    ji ,
                                                   j
                                                   X
                                       O† |eii =        ∗ e
                                                       Oij |ji .                               (3.26)
                                                   j

Then there exists an operator OE acting just on E that obeys
                                         OE |ψi
                                             e = O|ψi
                                                    e ,
                                         O† |ψi
                                           E
                                             e = O† |ψi
                                                     e                                         (3.27)

for any |ψi
         e ∈ HC if and only if O commutes with the projection of any operator XE
onto the code subspace, where XE acts on E. In other words
                                   hei|[O, XE ]|e
                                                ji = 0        ∀i, j.                           (3.28)
  11
     This average can be computed using the unitary integration technology described for example in
appendix D of [27]; the corrections vanish like powers of 2−k , which will be exponentially small in N
for our AdS-CFT construction.




                                               – 15 –
     We give a proof of this theorem in appendix B. It is clear that the set of O’s that
satisfy the assumptions of the theorem form a unital *-subalgebra A of the operators
on the code subspace, meaning they include the identity and are closed under addition,
multiplication, and hermitian conjugation. If we take A to be the entire algebra of
operators on HC then we recover our condition (3.21). Notice, however, that when A
is a proper subalgebra we cannot use our previous argument to derive the condition
(3.19) from (3.21), since the O that we constructed that doesn’t have an OE will not
be in A. This gives a loophole that simultaneously allows correlation between O and
XE and the existence of OE .
     For example in the two qubit system, consider a code subspace spanned by √12 (|00i + |11i)
and √12 (|01i + |10i). The operator X that exchanges these two states can be realized
just on the first qubit as the X1 operator that flips it, even though in either state this
operator is perfectly correlated with the X2 operator that flips the second qubit. This
is possible because the Z operator on the code subspace, for which the first state is a
+1 eigenstate and the second state is a −1 eigenstate, cannot be realized as an operator
just on the first qubit; this code corrects only the subalgebra generated by 1 and X.
     This example has the perhaps surprising property that the encoded 1 and X op-
erators can be realized on either of the two qubits, which seems in tension with our
discussion of the no-cloning theorem above (3.19). This is an artifact, however, of the
fact that this subalgebra is abelian, and is thus in some sense classical. It is easy
to prove that as long as the subalgebra is non-abelian, if it can be represented on E
then it cannot be represented on E; the proof follows immediately by contradiction if
we look at the commutator of two non-commuting elements of the algebra, but with
one represented on E and one represented on E. We used this “algebraic no-cloning
theorem” above in our discussion of figure 3.


4   AdS/CFT as quantum error correction
We now return to our discussion of bulk reconstruction. Consider again the right
diagram in figure 3. We argued using the AdS-Rindler reconstruction that the operator
in the center can be represented either as an operator φAB with support on A ∪ B, an
operator φBC with support on B ∪ C, or an operator φAC with support on A ∪ C. By
now it should be obvious that this is directly analogous to the situation with O12 , O23 ,
and O13 in the three qutrit example, or more generally the existence of the operator
OE . The main proposal of this paper is that this is more than an analogy, it is actually
how AdS/CFT is reproducing the bulk! In other words we can think of local bulk
operators as logical operations on an encoded subspace, which becomes better and
better protected against localized boundary errors as we move the operators inwards in

Figure 4. Correcting for erasures in AdS/CFT. Bulk quantum information at point in the
center is protected in the CFT against the erasure of the boundary of any one of the green
regions, but bulk information at the point near the boundary is completely lost by an erasure
of the boundary of the red region.



the radial direction.12 We illustrate this in figure 4. In the remainder of the paper we
will spell out this idea in more detail, giving the bulk versions of most of the statements
of the previous section.

4.1    Defining code subspaces
We begin by defining a set of candidate code subspaces for AdS/CFT. Our proposal is
that we should pick some finite set of local bulk operators φi (x), realized in the CFT
via the global representation of section 2.1. We then define a code subspace HC as the
linear span of states of the form

                              |Ωi, φi (x)|Ωi, φi (x1 )φj (x2 )|Ωi, . . . ,                     (4.1)

where we take the range of i, the number of φi (x)’s we act with, and the number of
points x where the operators can be located to be bounded by some fixed finite number.
Here |Ωi is the ground state of the system; we could also do a similar construction
around other sufficiently “semiclassical” states, but for rigor we will stick to |Ωi since,
as mentioned in section 2.1, the existence of appropriate smearing functions has not
been completely established in the general case. We postpone to section 5 the question
of how large HC can be. It is essential that our definition of the code subspace will
be different for different choices of the operators φi (x); the set of erasures that are
  12
    One detail here is that in defining the “center” of AdS we are implicitly choosing a conformal
frame in the CFT; otherwise AdS is a homogeneous space and no point is special. This is also implicit
in our notion of “small” and “large” erasures in the CFT.




                                                – 17 –
correctable will depend on this choice, and we can learn about the way that the bulk
theory is realized in the CFT by studying this dependence. For example, in figure 4
we see that moving the operators closer to the boundary makes our code subspace less
protected against small erasures. The CFT is not just one error-correcting code, it is
many at once!
     We would like to think of the operators φi (x) as logical operations on this code
subspace, but this does not quite work since by construction acting repeatedly with
φi (x) will eventually take us out of HC . To get a set of operators that really act
within HC we can include projection operators onto HC on both sides of φi ; these will
be irrelevant except in studying high-point correlation functions, so we will not carry
them around explicitly here.13 Now consider a decomposition of the boundary Cauchy
surface Σ into A and A. If our code subspace HC can protect against the erasure of A,
then by our condition (3.21) it must be that we can find a representation of any operator
on HC with support only in A. In fact, this is what the AdS-Rindler reconstruction
we reviewed in section 2.2 provides us; any causal wedge WC [A] which contains the
locations of the φi (x)’s used in defining HC will allow a set of operators φA,i (x) with
support only on A and whose action on HC is the same as that of φi (x). We now see
that in the CFT this is a statement about being able to correct for the erasure of A.
     To avoid confusion, we stress that, just because we do not include some φ(x) in
defining the code subspace, we do not mean to imply that its AdS-Rindler recon-
struction does not work on that subspace. We could easily consider a slightly larger
subspace where we include it, and we could then interpret its AdS-Rindler reconstruc-
tion as arising from quantum error correction. The only fundamental limitation on the
AdS-Rindler reconstruction comes from the backreaction considerations we discuss in
section 5 below.

4.2    Bulk correlation and smearing
It is illuminating to understand in more detail to what extent the AdS-Rindler recon-
struction is consistent with our three equivalent conditions (3.14), (3.19), (3.21) for
quantum erasure correction. We clearly do not expect them to hold exactly, but we
might hope for them to hold in the approximate sense of (3.23). As we explained in
section 3.4, a good diagnostic for approximate quantum erasure correction is that the
  13
    A subtlety here is that the states (4.1) are not mutually orthogonal; a state of the form φm |Ωi
                                                         m
has a normalized overlap with the vacuum of order √hΩ|φ 2m |Ωi
                                                                ∼ 2−m . The scaling with m follows
                                                        hΩ|φ   |Ωi
from counting Wick contractions at leading order in 1/N . If we choose our code subspace such that
the maximum power of each φ grows like some power of N , then for states on which the projection
onto HC is nontrivial this overlap will be exponentially small in N . It then will be okay to conjugate
the φ’s by these projectors without ruining their low-point correlation functions.

Figure 5. Potentially troublesome bulk correlation. Here φ(x) is an operator that acts
within the code subspace HC , and which we thus expect can be represented as an operator
on A. φ(y) we similarly expect to reconstructed on A, but there is nonvanishing correlation
between them in the ground state |Ωi. Using inequality (3.25), this correlation puts a lower
bound on the accuracy with which we can view AdS/CFT as quantum error correction in the
conventional sense of section 3.2.



correlation functions between operators acting within the code subspace and operators
acting on the set to be erased are small enough that the inequality (3.25) does not
preclude (3.23) from holding.14
     In fact it is a basic property of bulk physics that there is correlation between fields
in WC [A] and fields in WC [A], as we indicate in figure 5. In deciding whether or not
this bulk correlation interferes with our interpretation of AdS-Rindler reconstruction as
quantum error correction, we need to properly take into account the operator eigenval-
ues in the denominator of (3.25). Formally these are infinite in a continuum quantum
field theory, but every quantum field theorist knows that field operators are not really
well-defined until they are integrated against smooth test functions with support over
some region of nonzero measure, which we will take to have linear size s . For simplicity
we will take the bulk fields to be massless scalars and take their separation to be small
compared to the AdS radius, in which case we have
                                                          d−1

                                    λ2φ            d(x, y)

Here d is the spacetime dimension of the boundary theory and d(x, y) is the geodesic
distance between x and y. This formula also holds in other states we produce by acting
on |Ωi with smeared operators near x, and thus on average in the code subspace HC .
 14
      We thank Juan Maldacena for pointing out the relevance of (3.25) in this situation.




                                                 – 19 –
We thus see that the right hand side of (3.25) will be small in our case provided that
the operators φi (x) used in constructing HC are smeared over a distance which is small
compared to their distance to the causal surface χA of the wedge WC [A] in which we
are trying to reconstruct them.
    This observation does much to justify our interpretation of AdS-Rindler reconstruc-
tion as quantum error correction, but it is somewhat unsatisfactory in the sense that
the AdS-Rindler reconstruction still seems to work in the situation where we smear the
operators over a distance that is comparable to their distance to the bifurcate Rindler
horizon χA , even though the bulk correlation is then too large to be ignored. Indeed we
interpret this as saying that the conventional quantum error correction of section 3.2
does not fully capture the mechanism by which AdS/CFT realizes bulk locality. The
operator algebra quantum error correction introduced in section 3.5, however, provides
precisely the generalization we need to fix this. Consider for example an operator S
which acts on φ(x)|Ωi as Sφ(x)|Ωi = |Ωi, and which annihilates any state orthogonal
to φ(x)|Ωi. This is an operator that acts within the code subspace, but its commutator
with an operator φ(y) in WC [A] obeys

                            hΩ|[S, φ(y)]|Ωi = hΩ|φ(x)φ(y)|Ωi 6= 0.                              (4.3)

Thus S clearly cannot have a representation as an operator just on A. Fortunately
there is no reason to expect this operator to have an AdS-Rindler reconstruction, but
the broader lesson is that we should really expect AdS-Rindler reconstruction to in
general produce only a subalgebra of the operators on HC . We saw in section 3.5 that
the condition a subalgebra must obey for this to be possible is that the subalgebra must
commute with the projection onto HC of any operator on A. In fact this is precisely
the condition that we expect to be true for local operators in WC [A] (and their sums
and products), which by bulk causality should commute with operators in WC [A].15
That this commutator vanishes with the projections onto HC of all CFT operators in
A is not something we can prove directly, but AdS-Rindler reconstruction requires it.
    A second reason to prefer operator algebra quantum error correction is that even
when the right hand side of (4.2) is small, it will at most be suppressed by some
fixed power of 1/N . This is because we should not smear the operators over distances
shorter than the Planck length. Since we in principle would like a version of AdS-
Rindler reconstruction that works to all orders in 1/N , it would be unsatisfying if our
error correction interpretation failed at some finite order because of bulk correlation.
  15
    This statement is rendered somewhat more subtle by the need for gravitational dressing to localize
operators in a gravitational theory; we will see in section 5 that this commutator continues to vanish
at higher orders in 1/N , as required by operator algebra quantum error correction.

Figure 6. A reconstruction phase transition? As we increase the region A, the extremal-
area codimension two surface of smallest area whose boundary is ∂A, shown as the solid lines,
changes discontinuously. Does this mean that we can now reconstruct the point in the center
as an operator on A?



     We can now state our final proposal: the AdS-Rindler reconstruction of local bulk
operators in [7, 8] is dual in the CFT to the operator algebra quantum error correction
of [32, 33]. An erasure of a region A is correctable if the φi (x)’s used in defining the
code subspace all lie within the causal wedge WC [A]. In cases where the operators
we are interested in are well-localized away from the causal surface χA of WC [A], the
situation is well-approximated by conventional quantum error correction. Either way,
the further the φi (x)’s are from the asymptotic boundary, the better they are protected
from CFT erasures.
     It is worth emphasizing that in the case where a bulk operator is of order an AdS
radius distance from WC [A], our approximate equivalence between conventional and
operator algebra quantum error correction requires sub-AdS scale bulk locality. This
is a special property of those CFTs that have local holographic duals, which we have
here reformulated in the language of quantum information theory.

4.3   Disconnected regions and quantum secret sharing
So far we have only discussed the erasure of connected regions of the boundary. More
general erasures are also interesting. Consider for example the AdS3 situation depicted
in figure 6. Here we consider a region A which is the union of two disjoint intervals;
in other words we have erased two disjoint intervals. Can we choose a code subspace
where we can realize the bulk operator in the center as an operator acting on A or
A? If the AdS-Rindler reconstruction is the last word on bulk reconstruction [11],
then the answer is clearly no; this point lies neither in WC [A] nor in WC [A]. This is
possible within the context of quantum error correction, but only if both A and A can



                                           – 21 –
access partial information about the code subspace. For example, say that A had no
information whatsoever about which state of the code subspace we are in. Then by
definition (3.14) would hold, so we could recover the information from A. We are not,
however, able to determine whether or not such partial information is really present.
      In fact there have been recent conjectures in the literature that this operator can
still be reconstructed in A as long as A is bigger than A; more generally, the claim is that
one can do reconstruction throughout the entanglement wedge, which is defined as the
bulk domain of dependence of any bulk spacelike surface whose boundary is the union
of A and the codimension two extremal-area surface of minimal area whose boundary
is ∂A [12, 34–36].16 In the figure, the intersection of the entanglement wedge with a
bulk Cauchy surface is shaded blue; the minimal area condition causes a discontinuous
change as we increase the size of A. Is this conjecture compatible with our proposal?
Indeed it is; we saw below equation (3.22) that in a generic code subspace any A which
is greater than half of the system can correct for the erasure of its complement A.17 The
sharp jump in correctability as A surpasses A in size is consistent with our analysis
around (3.22), where from Page’s theorem we expect that the density matrix of A
together with the reference system will approach being maximally mixed exponentially
fast once we cross the transition.
      In section 3.3 we saw that a division of the CFT into a union of shares with
the property that any collection of the shares has either complete information or no
information about the encoded state is called a quantum secret sharing scheme; we
now see that in the situation of figure 6 we will be able to reconstruct the operator in
the center if and only if our boundary division into four regions gives a quantum secret
sharing scheme.

4.4    MERA as an error correcting code?
One shortcoming of our work so far is that, although we have laid out a plausible
CFT interpretation of AdS-Rindler reconstruction as quantum error correction, we
have ultimately relied on the bulk in deriving this reconstruction. This boils down to
  16
     One argument that this must be the case is as follows: the extension by [37] of the Ryu-Takayanagi
proposal [38] to next to leading order in 1/N claims that bulk entanglement entropy in the entangle-
ment wedge contributes to the Von Neumann entropy SA . So for example if we have a spin sitting
in the entanglement wedge of A that is entangled with another spin in WC [A], then the spin in the
entanglement wedge contributes log 2 to SA . It is hard to see how this could be the case if we could not
project the spin onto a definite state by doing some measurement on A, but the operator we measure
would then be a representation on A of a logical operator on the spin.
  17
     More carefully it has to be greater than half by an amount that depends on the size of the code
subspace, which we can think of as being parametrically smaller than the full Hilbert space. We
explore this in more detail in the following section.

the assumption that there exist operators in the CFT that obey the bulk equations
of motion and algebra on a subspace. We then use this assumption to perform the
Bogoliubov transformation that relates the global and the Rindler reconstructions.
This assumption is quite plausible, and essentially follows from the assumed large-N
structure of the CFT [39], but it would still be nice if we could explicitly demonstrate
the structure of the quantum error correcting code in the CFT. In particular, in section
4.2 we had to use bulk causality to argue that the necessary and sufficient condition
(3.28) for operator algebra quantum error correction held, and we were not able to
check it explicitly for all possible CFT operators on A. Similarly we were unable to
determine whether or not the central point could be reconstructed in the two-interval
A of the previous subsection.
     A promising starting point for addressing these issues is the MERA tensor network
construction of a discrete version of AdS/CFT [40–42]. It seems possible that in that
fairly controlled setting one could rigorously confirm the quantum error correction
structure we have motivated in this paper. Moreover, one could attempt to determine
explicitly whether or not the example of the previous subsection allows reconstruction of
the operator in the center; this could be done by using the global construction to make
a code subspace, entangling this code subspace with a reference system R to prepare
a state |φi, and then seeing whether there is mutual information between R and A.
The state |φi would still be prepared by a tensor network, with tensors acting both on
the CFT and/or the reference system. This calculation would go a long way towards
settling the “causal wedge vs. entanglement wedge” debate of bulk reconstruction.18
We will not attempt this calculation here, but the typicality argument leading to (3.22)
favors the entanglement wedge; we will say more about this in section 5.3.


5        Backreaction and holography
We now turn to the question of how large we can make the code subspace HC . Each
φi (x) that we act with raises the energy of the state, so doing so repeatedly will eventu-
ally lead to backreaction becoming important. When this happens it is clear that the
approximation of perturbation theory around a fixed background geometry will break
down. In this section we argue that this is related to a basic property of error correct-
    18
    One challenge in doing this is that the region of discrepancy between the entanglement wedge and
the causal wedge in that example has a size which is only of order the AdS radius, and it is not so
clear how to represent sub-AdS scale physics using MERA. One strategy for getting around this is to
consider the limit of A being a union of a large number of smaller disjoint intervals of equal size; this
allows a parametrically large separation between the causal wedge and the entanglement wedge.

ing codes: the larger the code subspace, the fewer correctable errors. For erasures we
quantified this in equation (3.22) above.

5.1    Defining local operators
Once we allow nontrivial backreaction, it is no longer possible to ignore the issue of how
we define bulk local operators in a diffeomorphism-invariant way. Following [43, 44],
we do this by choosing a cutoff surface at large but finite radius, with induced metric
Sd−1 × R, and then specifying bulk points by sending in spacelike geodesics from the
t = 0 slice of this cutoff surface that start out orthogonal to the Sd−1 directions. We
then take the limit as the cutoff surface approaches the boundary. Points are labeled
by a location on Sd−1 , a renormalized proper distance along the geodesic, and an angle
in the radial/temporal plane. This is illustrated in figure 7. These geodesics can
be thought of as the “gravitational dressing” of the bulk operator, analogous to the
Wilson line one would use to connect a charged operator to the boundary to make it
gauge-invariant in electrodynamics.
    As in the electromagnetic case, the operators defined in this way will have nonlocal
commutators due to their nontrivial Dirac brackets. The study of these commutators
was initiated in [18], and more recently elaborated in [44].19 A full analysis has not yet
been completed, however, and one point that has not yet been addressed is essential
  19
    A subtlety here is that they send their geodesics from arbitrary boundary times, but take them
to be orthogonal to the boundary in the temporal direction as well as the Sd−1 directions. These
operators agree with ours at t = 0, which is where we will study them, but as a matter of principle we
have not made their choice because we want to restrict to Schrodinger-picture operators acting on a

Figure 8. Two dressed bulk local operators. If the operator on the right is to be reconstructed
on the boundary of the green wedge, and the operator on the left to be reconstructed on the
boundary of the blue wedge, then they must be commuting operators. By taking one of these
operators to the boundary, we conclude that any dressed bulk local operator must commute
with all boundary local operators except possibly those at the endpoint of its geodesic.



for the consistency of the AdS/Rindler reconstruction at higher orders in 1/N : to
all orders in 1/N perturbation theory around a fixed background, two dressed bulk
operators with the property that all points on their dressing geodesics are mutually
spacelike separated in that background must commute.20 The reason this must be the
case is illustrated in figure 8.
     We can use this observation to verify that bulk non-locality from the gravitational
dressing of operators does not invalidate some of our previous claims. In the introduc-
tion we argued that, because in the bulk theory a local operator in the center of the
space commutes with all local operators at the boundary, the bulk operator algebra
is inconsistent with the CFT algebra. We can now give a version of this argument
that includes the gravitational dressing; from figure 8, we see that we should modify
the previous statement to “commutes with all local operators at the boundary except
at one point”. Were this to hold as an operator equation in the CFT, it would now
not imply that the operator in the center must be trivial in the CFT, but it would
imply that this operator can be nontrivial at t = 0 only at the point where the dressing
fixed time slice at the boundary. As explained in more detail in section 4.2 of [18], this is the natural
way to define the fixed-time Hilbert space in the bulk, since it makes it clear that expectation values
are independent of possible sources on the boundary at later times.
   20
      More carefully, we should hold the boundary endpoints of the geodesics fixed as we take N → ∞
for this statement to hold. One of us (DH) has checked this statement directly in bulk canonical
gravity in the setup of [44], by computing the Dirac brackets and seeing that they are local in the x̂
directions to any finite order in perturbation theory, but we postpone discussion of this to a future
publication.

Figure 9. An algebraic paradox: a bulk operator at φ(x) is dressed by a geodesic ending at
X. The bulk algebra suggests this operator commutes with all local CFT operators on the
Cauchy surface Σ except those at X, and is thus a local operator there. However, we can find
a boundary point Y which is both spacelike separated from X and causally separated from
x; the bulk would then require local operators there which don’t commute with φ(x), while
the CFT would require them all to commute.



geodesic ends.21 This statement, however, is not consistent with bulk causality, as we
illustrate in figure 9. So we thus indeed find that the bulk operator algebra cannot
be realized in the CFT at the level of operator equations. As already explained, the
resolution is that the bulk algebra holds in the CFT only acting on a code subspace of
states.
     Similarly we can now revisit our claim that bulk operators in WC [A] perturba-
tively commute with bulk operators in WC [A], which was a necessary condition for
our interpretation of the AdS-Rindler construction as operator algebra quantum error
correction. But this is exactly what the argument of figure 8 accomplishes; as long
as the gravitational dressing of an operator at x ∈ WC [A] also lies entirely in WC [A],
meaning that the spatial geodesic connecting x to the boundary also lies in WC [A], then
it will only have non-local commutators with operators that are also located in WC [A];
any operator whose localizing geodesic is entirely in one wedge will still perturbatively
commute with any operator whose localizing geodesic is entirely in the complementary
wedge.
  21
     As before this statement is straightforwardly true for scalars, fermions, and/or abelian gauge fields
on a lattice, and we expect it to hold also for non-abelian lattice gauge fields. In the continuum it
follows from a combination of the time-slice axiom and “Haag duality”, which says that if we split a
time-slice into two regions the commutant of the set of local operators in the domain of dependence
of one of the regions is the set of local operators in the domain of dependence of the other region. In
the case of gauge theories one has to be careful since Haag duality does not quite hold, since there can
be a nontrivial center of the algebra for a region, but the center is always localized near the boundary
[45] and shouldn’t disrupt this argument.




                                                 – 26 –
    In this subsection, to connect to the formalism of [44] we studied only operators
attached to geodesics that start out orthogonal to the boundary time direction at t = 0.
It would be interesting to do the analogue of their analysis at arbitrary temporal-radial
angle; this amounts to working with boundary conditions that approach the “open-
FRW” slicing of AdS

as χ → ∞. As explained in [18], this would be a natural bulk construction of
Schrodinger picture gauge-invariant operators on the fixed-boundary-time Hilbert space.

5.2    Shrinking of the causal wedge
We now return to the question of how backreaction affects causal wedge reconstruction.
Our basic proposal is that adding energy in the bulk causes the causal wedge of a
fixed boundary region A to recede towards the boundary, giving it less access to bulk
operators defined at fixed renormalized geodesic distance (for some related discussion
see [14, 34, 35, 46, 47]).
     Consider for example the AdS-Schwarzschild geometry in d + 1 dimensions.

for all α > 0 and for all r > r+ (α), where r+ (α) is the positive root of f . This can be
shown analytically in various limits, and is easily checked numerically in the general
case. One can also study the asymptotically-AdS3 BTZ black hole, where a similar
result holds and all integrals can be done analytically. Thus we see that indeed the
causal wedge has access to fewer and fewer bulk observables as we increase the mass of
the matter in the center. This after all must be the case, since as we keep increasing the
mass a point at fixed renormalized geodesic distance from the boundary will eventually
go through the horizon.
     It is interesting to think about how general this statement is; under what circum-
stances can the causal wedge move inwards in renormalized geodesic distance as we
insert energy? One might guess that the null energy condition should generically pre-
vent this, but to test that we need a more precise conjecture. One first guess is that in
any geometry obeying the null energy condition the causal wedge of a fixed boundary
region can see at most as far in renormalized geodesic distance as it can in the vacuum.
In fact this conjecture is false, we have constructed explicit counterexamples. Indeed
a weaker conjecture, where we replace the null energy condition by the dominant en-
ergy condition22 , still has counterexamples. One counterexample is given by a small
perturbation of AdS4 , with the metric

With a small positive , the causal wedges of certain fixed boundary regions can see
farther in renormalized geodesic distance than they can in the vacuum. These bound-
ary regions include spherical regions whose causal wedges probe deep into the bulk
geometry.
    Although these counterexamples prevent any straightforward “monoticity of causal
wedge recession theorem”, we expect that the Schwarzschild calculation we have just
  22
    With the presence of a negative cosmological constant, we only impose the dominant energy
condition on the “matter” part of stress tensor which does not include the cosmological constant.
This was used in [48] to prove the positive mass theorem in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space.

discussed captures the general tendency. It would be nice to prove a more general
theorem verifying this, but we have not succeeded in finding one.

5.3    Counting states
The recession of the causal wedge has a nice quantum error correction interpretation;
as we allow the code subspace to have more and more excited states, a bulk operator
localized at some fixed geodesic distance will eventually no longer lie in the causal
wedge of a fixed boundary region. In other words, the code will lose some of its ability
to correct erasures; we will need access to more of the boundary to study the same bulk
observables. In this subsection we study this a bit more quantitatively, making contact
with the general condition (3.22) for typical correctability.
     To apply (3.22) to AdS/CFT, we need to identify CFT analogues of the quantities
n, l, and k. n is the total number of qubits used in doing the encoding, and should
roughly correspond to the total number of CFT degrees of freedom relevant for recon-
structing a particular bulk region of interest. This is somewhat nontrivial; the CFT
has an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the UV which are needed to reconstruct
bulk operators that are arbitrarily close to the boundary. To deal with this we take
our code subspace to only involve states where we act on the vacuum with operators
φi (x) that are all localized within a region R at the center of the AdS space that has
proper size of order the AdS radius. We will also take them to be smeared over dis-
tances that are small compared to their separation from the boundary of R, so that we
do not have to worry about the difference between conventional and operator algebra
quantum error correction. The global reconstructions (2.2) of these operators involve
integrals over functions that vary smoothly on the scale of the radius of curvature of
the boundary Sd−1 , so we can integrate out all CFT degrees of freedom with shorter
wavelength.23 For concreteness we will consider the case of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills
theory in 3 + 1 boundary dimensions with gauge group SU (N ), in which case we have

                                              n ∼ N 2.                                         (5.10)

Erasing a disc of angular size θ will then correspond to erasing
                                               θ − sin θ
                                          l=             n                                     (5.11)
                                                  2π
qubits, where this function is just n times the ratio of the area of the disc to the area
of the S3 .
  23
    It is not hard to generalize to the case where R is taken to be parametrically larger than the AdS
radius, this essentially involves a repeat of the analysis of [49].




                                               – 29 –
    Let us first consider the case where the code subspace is small, that is when k ∼ 1.
From (3.22) we then expect that we can correct for the erasure as long as n − 2l  1,
or in other words θ < π. But this is exactly what we expect from the AdS-Rindler
reconstruction; once θ < π, WC [A] will contain the center of the space. It is interesting
to note that the derivation of (3.22) applied to an erasure of an arbitrary collection of
` qubits, so this suggests that we should also be able to reconstruct operators in the
center on a union of disconnected regions, provided that together they make up more
than half of the boundary. With regards to our discussion of section 4.3, this gives
support to the entanglement wedge over the causal wedge.
    We can now start increasing k; nothing interesting will happen until we get k ∼ N 2 ,
after which the set of erasures we are able to correct will start decreasing. But this is
exactly the condition for backreaction to become important in the center; with k ∼ N 2
the entropy of the code subspace is comparable to that of a black hole filling R and
thus most states in the code subspace must actually be black holes. So both on the
CFT side through equation (3.22) and the bulk side via backreaction we arrive at the
same conclusion for when correctability should break down. This is a manifestation of
the holographic entropy bound of [50].


6   Conclusion
In this paper we have provided what we consider to be a new understanding of how
the holographic principle is realized in AdS/CFT. Bulk effective field theory operators
emerge as a set of logical operations on various encoded subspaces, which are protected
against local errors in the boundary CFT. The bulk algebra is realized only on these
subspaces, and only if we do not try to describe too many operations at once. Asking
for more causes the error correction procedure to fail, which in the bulk is manifested
by the formation of a black hole.
     To some extent we have only recast known facts about the AdS-Rindler recon-
struction in a new language, but in our view that construction is quite opaque once the
operators in the boundary domain of dependence of A are evolved back to the bound-
ary Cauchy surface Σ at t = 0. Our description in terms of error correction is phrased
entirely on this Cauchy surface, and gives what we feel to be a satisfying interpretation
of how the AdS-Rindler reconstruction is realized in the CFT that cleanly resolves some
of its paradoxical features.
     It is of course interesting to ask if there are any implications of this work for the
recent controversy on whether or not the interiors of black holes are describable in
AdS/CFT; for now we leave this for future study.

where dHd−1   is the standard metric on the d − 1 dimensional hyperbolic ball Hd−1 .
We will refer to coordinates on Hd−1 collectively as α. A free real scalar field on this
background can be expressed in the Heisenberg picture as

              φ(ρ, τ, α) =            fωλ (ρ, τ, α)aωλ + fωλ (ρ, τ, α)aωλ ,       (A.2)
                            0  2π λ

where fωλ (ρ, τ, α) is a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation of the form

                           fωλ (ρ, τ, α) = e−iωτ Yλ (α)ψωλ (ρ).                   (A.3)

Here Yλ (α) is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian on Hd−1 with eigenvalue −λ; the set
                                        P
of λ’s is continuous (and positive) so “ λ ” should really be understood as shorthand
for an integral together with a sum over degeneracies. ψωλ is explicitly given by

The normalization is chosen to ensure that a and a† have the usual algebra, and implies
that for ρ large and negative, ψωλ is of order √1ω . F is a hypergeometric function that
goes to one as ρ → ∞. By comparing to the extrapolate dictionary (1.1) we can read
off that                       Z
                        Oωλ = dτ dαeiωτ Yλ∗ (α)O(τ, α) = Nωλ aωλ ,                      (A.7)

and substituting back into (A.2) and formally exchanging the τ α integral with the ωλ
integral/sum we arrive at
                                Z
                    φ(ρ, τ, α) = dτ 0 dα0 K(ρ, τ, α; τ 0 α0 )O(τ 0 , α0 ).      (A.8)

The “smearing function” K is given by
                              Z ∞
                       0 0        dω X 1                    0             0
           K(ρ, τ, α; τ α ) =              fωλ (ρ, τ, α)eiωτ Yλ∗ (α0 )eiωτ .            (A.9)
                               −∞ 2π λ Nωλ


K can be understood as a kernel for constructing a bulk solution of the KG equation
in the AdS-Rindler wedge given arbitrary boundary conditions at spatial infinity as a
function of τ and α. It was immediately realized, however, that in fact this expression
for K is not well-defined [7] (see also [51, 52]); the reason is that from Stirling’s formula
it is straightforward to see that at large λ we have
                                                    √
                                      |Nωλ |2 ∼ e−π λ .                                (A.10)

This is problematic for the convergence of the λ integral in (A.9), and using the WKB
approximation for Y and ψ at large λ it is not hard to see that indeed the integral does
not converge for any choice of bulk and boundary points [8, 51, 52].
    In fact, the nonconvergence of K is necessary to avoid the following paradox; say
that we have two overlapping Rindler wedges, WC [A] and WC [B], as in figure 10. If K
existed then since the fωλ solutions are complete it would construct a unique solution
of the KG equation in WC [A] with some particular boundary conditions in D[A]. We

can, however, imagine modifying the spatial boundary conditions at a point x that is
in D[B] but not in D[A], such that x is nonetheless causally separated from a point
in WC [A]. We then should be able to send a signal to WC [A] without modifying the
boundary conditions in D[A], which contradicts the uniqueness of the solution.
     In [7] it was argued that one should analytically continue in the boundary spatial
coordinates to avoid this divergence, but this is a rather unusual thing to do to a
quantum field theory and would be rather problematic from the point of view of our
analysis in this paper. The issue was recently illuminated considerably in [8] (see also
[21]), where it was argued that as long as we are careful to think of K as a distribution
for integration against CFT correlation functions we are allowed to use it without any
analytic continuations. The key point of [8] was that at least at leading order in 1/N ,
if we integrate K against appropriate bulk test functions then its singularity structure
is such that we are always able to integrate it against CFT expectation values and get
a reasonable answer. Intuitively, the reason that this is able to avoid the contradiction
of the previous paragraph is that in the CFT O obeys a boundary equation of motion;
we are not free to choose it independently at different boundary times. Turning on a
source at x will necessarily propagate in the boundary into D[A] ∪ D[B], so we will not
be able to change the boundary data at x without also changing it in D[A].
     The argument of [8] does not immediately generalize to higher order corrections in
1/N , but we expect a more detailed analysis will show that it can be improved order
by order in 1/N .24

    Recently it was argued that AdS/CFT in the AdS-Rindler wedge cannot be understood as a
statement about subregions in the global CFT [53]. It is true that there is a subtlety here in that
the cutoffs in the bulk are different in the two cases, but AdS/CFT is really a statement about the
continuum CFTs. The discrepancies discussed in [53] were localized to “cutoff sized regions” in the
CFT, which really means that they are not part of the continuum theory. That CFT expectation

B     The basic theorem of operator algebra quantum error cor-
      rection
In this appendix we prove the theorem of section 3.5. The proof is original, but the
theorem is a special case of the results of [32, 33].

Proof. Indeed say that we have a code subspace HC spanned by an orthonormal basis
|eiiEE . Moreover say that O is an operator which acts as
                                            X
                                    O|eii =   Oji |e
                                                   ji
                                                         j
                                                         X
                                        O† |eii =             ∗ e
                                                             Oij |ji.                          (B.1)
                                                         j

Finally, say that for any operator XE acting on E we have

                                hei|[O, XE ]|e
                                             ji = 0                     ∀i, j.                 (B.2)

We’d then like to show that there exists an operator OE acting only on E and obeying

                                          OE |eii = O|eii
                                          O† |eii = O† |eii.

    Let us first observe that in general in a bipartite system in a state
                                       X
                                 |ψi =      Cba |aiA |biB ,                                    (B.4)
                                                ab

operators OA on A and OB on B will obey

                                         OB |ψi = OA |ψi                                       (B.5)

if and only if
                                                   T
                                          OB C = COA .                                         (B.6)
    Now in the setup of the theorem, let us consider the state25
                                       X
                                 |φi =     |iiR |eiiEE .                                       (B.7)
                                                     i

values have the right singularity structure to be integrated against K in (A.9) is related to the fact
that they are computed in states that remain finite energy as we take the continuum limit, and as
explained in [8] it is forgetting this that leads to trouble.
  25
     For convenience we have dropped the overall normalization, it will cancel between the two sides
of (B.6).




                                                 – 34 –
The properties (B.3) will clearly hold if and only if they hold on |φi, ie if

                                         OE |φi = O|φi
                                         OE† |φi = O† |φi,                               (B.8)

so this is all we need to show ((B.3) follows from applying projections to R).
    Our strategy then is to notice that we can decompose REE into a bipartite system
in two different ways, either as the R system and the EE system or as the E system
and the RE system. The first decomposition is manifest in (B.7), and since in this case
C is just the identity we see that (B.6) holds and we have

                                         OR |φi = O|φi,                                  (B.9)

where OR ≡ OT acts just on R. The point then is that we can interpret OR as OR ⊗ IE ,
and then see if we can mirror it back onto E using (B.6). If so then we succeed in
constructing OE .
    To proceed, we can define
                                     X
                                         i
                              |eii =   Cam |miE |aiE ,                       (B.10)
                                           a,m

in which case we have                    X
                                                  i
                                 |φi =           Cam |imiRE |aiE .                      (B.11)
                                         i,a,m

It will be very convenient in what follows to treat C as a rectangular matrix, with a
being the first index and im being the second index. For example, we have the reduced
density matrices

                                          ρE = CC † ≡ g
                                      ρRE = C T C ∗ .                                   (B.12)

Since g is a non-negative hermitian matrix with positive trace, it will be invertible on a
subspace of E. Moreover, any state orthogonal to this subspace will also be orthogonal
to all of the |eii’s, so we can just take E to be given by this subspace; g is then invertible.
This then means that C has a right inverse C † g −1 .
     Now observe that the commutator condition (B.2) implies that

                                      C † CO = OC † C,                                  (B.13)

or equivalently that
                                    [OR ⊗ IE , ρRE ] = 0.                               (B.14)



                                                 – 35 –
If C † g −1 were a left inverse of C, then (B.6) would hold if we define

                                        OE = COC † g −1 ,                                   (B.15)

which would then give us the first equation in (B.8) (remember that OR = OT ). In
fact it is a right inverse, but we can use (B.13) to show that (B.6) holds nonetheless:26

                                  OE C = COC † g −1 C
                                        = g −1 CC † COC † g −1 C
                                        = g −1 COC † CC † g −1 C
                                        = g −1 COC † C
                                        = g −1 CC † CO
                                        = CO.                                               (B.16)

       Moreover

                                   OE† = g −1 CO† C †
                                        = g −1 CO† C † CC † g −1
                                        = CO† C † g −1 ,                                    (B.17)

where we’ve used (B.13), so the second equation in (B.8) is also satisfied. This concludes
the proof.

    Intuitively this is because if we do a Schmidt decomposition of |φi into RE and E, we can choose
a basis where C is actually a square matrix, so there is no difference between its left and right
inverses. The condition (B.13) ensures us that OR acts within the subspace defined by the Schmidt
decomposition.
