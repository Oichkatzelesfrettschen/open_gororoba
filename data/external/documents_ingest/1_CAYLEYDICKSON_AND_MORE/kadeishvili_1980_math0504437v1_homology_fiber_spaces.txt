In this paper the homology theory of fibre spaces is studied by introducing
additional algebraic structure in homology and cohomology.
All modules are assumed to be over an arbitrary associative ring Λ with
unit; by a differential algebra, coalgebra, module, or comodule we mean these
objects graded by non-negative integers; â denotes (−1)dega .
The category A(∞). An A(∞)-algebra in the sense of Stasheff [1] is defined
to be a graded Λ-module M , endowed with a set of operations {mi : ⊗i M →
M, i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying the conditions mi ((⊗i M )q) ⊂ Mq+i−2 and

for any ai ∈ M and i ≥ 1. A morphism of A(∞)-algebras (M, {mi }) →
(M ′ , {m′i }) is a set of homomorphisms {fi : ⊗i M → M ′ , i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying
′
the conditions fi ((⊗i M )q) ⊂ Mq+i−1
and

P
where S(t, i) = {k1 , ..., kt ∈ N,
kp = i}. The A(∞)-algebras together with
these morphisms form a category, which we denote by A(∞).
The specification on M of an A(∞)-algebra structure (M, {mi }) is equivalent
to the specification on the tensor coalgebra
T c (M ) = Λ + M + M ⊗ M + ... with
P
the grading dim(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) =
dimai + n and comultiplication
∆(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) =

of a differential dm : T c (M ) → T c (M ) that turns T c (M ) into a differential
coalgebra; this set {mi } determines the differential dm by
dm (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) =

X n−k
X

(−1)k â1 ⊗ ... ⊗ âk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ an ,

and the differential coalgebra (T c (M ), dm ) is called the B̃-construction of the
A(∞)-algera (M, {mi }) (Stasheff [1]) and is denoted by B̃(M, {mi }). The specification of an A(∞)-algebra morphism {fi } : (M, {mi }) → (M ′ , {m′i }) is equivalent to that of a differential coalgebra mapping f : B̃(M, {mi }) → B̃(M ′ , {m′i });
the morphism {fi } determines the mapping f by
f (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) =

n X
X

fk1 (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1 ) ⊗ ... ⊗ fkt (an−kt +1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai ).

Thus the category A(∞) can be identified with a full subcategory of the category
of differential coalgebras.
An arbitrary object in A(∞) of the form (M, {m1 , m2 , 0, 0, ...}) is identified
with the differential algebra (M, ∂, ·) where ∂ = m1 and a1 · a2 = −m2 (ã1 ⊗ a2 ).
For such an object the B̃-construction coincides with the usual B-construction,
any morphism of such objects of the form {f1 , 0, 0, ...} is identified with the
differential algebra mapping f1 : (M, ∂, ·) → (M , ∂, ·). Thus the category of
differential algebras is a subcategory of A(∞), while the category DASH (see
[2]) is the full subcategory of A(∞) generated by differential algebras, and the
functor B̃ is an extension of B from this subcategory to A(∞).
Theorem 1 For any differential algebra C with free Hi (C), i ≥ 0 it is possible
to introduce on H(C) an A(∞)-algebra structure
(H(C), {Xi }), Xi : ⊗i H(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...
such that X1 = 0, X2 (a1 ⊗ a2 ) = −ã1 · a2 and there exists an A(∞)-morphism
{fi } : (H(C), {Xi }) → (C, {m1 , m2 , 0, 0, ...})
for which f1 : H(C) → C induces an identical isomorphis in homology.
Proof. We need to construct two sets of homomorphisms
{Xi : ⊗i H(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...}, {fi : ⊗i H(C) → C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...},
satisfying the conditions in the definition of the category A(∞):
i−1 X
i−k

(−1)k Xi−j+1 (â1 ⊗ ... ⊗ âk ⊗ Xj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ak+j+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai ) = 0,

P1i−1
s=1 m2 (fs (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ as ) ⊗ fi−s (as+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai ))

(2)
for arbitrary ak ∈ H(C) and i ≥ 1. Fir i = 1 we take X1 = 0, and, using
the fact that Hi (C) is free, we define f1 : H(C) → C to be a cycle-choosing
homomorphis; the conditions (1) and (2), as well as the initial condition on f1
are thereby satisfied. Suppose now that Xi and fi have been constructed for
i < n in such a way that the conditions (1) and (2) hold. Let
Pn−1
U (a ⊗ ... ⊗ a ) =
m (f (a ⊗ ... ⊗ as ) ⊗ fn−s (as+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ))+

(here the Xi and fi already defined are involved). Then the condition (2) takes
the form
m1 fn (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) = (f1 Xn − Un )(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ).
(3)
Direct calculations show that ∂Un = 0, that is, Un (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) is a cycle in
C for arbitrary ai ∈ H(C), and we define Xn (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) to be the class of
this cycle, that is, Xn = {Un }. Since f1 is a cycle-choosing homomorphism,
the difference f1 Xn − Un is homological to zero. Assuming that ai ∈ H(C) are
free generators we define fn (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an ) as an element of C boundaring this
difference and extend by linearity. For the Xn and fn thus defined the condition
(3) is automatically satisfied. The remanning condition (1) can be proved by a
straightforward check.
We remark that the theorem is true also when an arbitrary A(∞)-algebra
is taken instead of C, and H(M ) is understood to be the homology of M with
respect to the differential m1 .
The A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi }) we call the homology A(∞)-algebra of the
differential algebra C. As is clear from the proof, this structure is not uniquely
determined on H(C) (there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the fi ). We show
later that the structure of the homology A(∞)-algebra on H(C) is unique up
to isomorphism in A(∞).
We mention that if a1 · a2 = a2 · a3 = 0 for a1 , a2 , a3 ∈ H(C), then X3 (a1 ⊗
a2 ⊗ a3 ) is an element of the Massey product < a1 , a2 , a3 >, and this fact
provides us with examples in which the operation X3 is non-trivial. The next
result follows from the Theorem 1.
Corollary 1 The mapping of differential coalgebras
f : B̃(H(C), {Xi }) → B(C)
induces an isomorphism in homology.
The category M (∞). An A(∞)-module over an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi })
we define to be a graded Λ-module P , endowed with a set of operations {pi :
3

(⊗i−1 M ) ⊗ P → P, i = 1, 2, 3, ...} satisfying the conditions pi (((⊗i−1 M ) ⊗
P )q ) ⊂ Mq+i−2 and

i−1
ai−1 ⊗ b) + k=0 (−1)k pk+1 (â1 ⊗ ... ⊗ âk ⊗ pi−k (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b)) = 0.
The specification on P of an A(∞)-module structure over (M, {mi }) is equivalent to the specification on B̃(M, {mi }) ⊗ P of a differential that turns it into
a differential comodule over B̃(M, {mi }). The objects of the category M (∞)
are defined to be the pairs ((M, {mi }), (P, {pi })), where (M, {mi }) is an A(∞)algebra, and (P, {pi }) is an A(∞)-module over it. A morphism is defined to be a
pair of sets of homomorphisms {fi }, {gi } where {fi } : (M, {mi }) → (M ′ , {m′i })
is a morphism of A(∞)-algebras and
{gi : (⊗i−1 M ) ⊗ P → P ′ , i = 1, 2, 3, ...}
′
is a set satisfying the conditions gi (((⊗i−1 M ) ⊗ P )q ) ⊂ Pq+i−1

These conditions ensure that the mapping
g : B̃(M, {mi }) ⊗ P → B̃(M ′ , {m′i }) ⊗ P ′
given by
Pi P
g(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b) = t=1 S(t,i) fk1 (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1 ) ⊗ ...⊗
fkt−1 (ak1 +...+kt−2 +1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1 +...+kt−1 ) ⊗ gkt (ak1 +...+kt−1 +1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b)
is a differential comodule mapping compatible with f . With the obvious morphisms the category of pairs (C, D), where C is a differential algebra and D is
a differential module over it, forms a subcategory of M (∞).
Theorem 2 If C is a differential algebra and D is a differential module over
it such that Hi (C) and Hi (D) are free, then on H(D) it is possible to introduce the structure of an A(∞)-module (H(D), {Yi }), Yi : (⊗i−1 H(C)) ⊗
H(D) → H(D), p = 1, 2, 3, ... over the homology A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi })
such that Y1 = 0, Y2 (a ⊗ b) = −ã · b and there exists a morphism ({fi }, {gi }) :
((H(C), {Xi }), (H(D), {Yi })) → (C, D) of M (∞) for which f1 : H(C) → C and
g1 : H(D) → D induce identical isomorphisms in homology.
Proof. The sets {gi } and {Yi } are constructed by induction on i just as in the
proof of Theorem 1. Using the fact that Hi (D) is free, we define g1 to be a

4

cycle-choosing homomorphism, while Y1 = 0, and the conditions of the category
M (∞) are satisfied for i = 1. Let
Vn (a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)) =

n−2
an−1 ⊗ b) + k=1 (−1)k gk+1 (â1 ⊗ ... ⊗ âk ⊗ Yn−k (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)),
then ∂Vn = 0, therefore, we define Yn = {Vn }. Since g1 is a cycle-choosing
homomorphism, g1 Yn −Vn is a cycle in D homologous to zero. Using the fact that
Hi (D) is free, we define gn : (⊗n−1 ) ⊗ H(D) → H(D) to be a homomorphism
for which ∂gn = g1 Vn − Vn . The conditions of the category M (∞) are satisfied
for the Yn and gn thus defined.
Twisted tensor products. The twisted tensor products of Brown [3] can
be generalized from the case of differential algebras and modules to the case
of A(∞)-algebras and A(∞)-modules: for an arbitrary differential coalgebra
(K, d) and an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi }) a ∼-twisting cochain we define to be a
homomorphism φ : K → M of degree −1 that satisfies the condition
φd =

i=1

where ∆i : K → K ⊗ K is the homomorphism defined by ∆1 = idK , ∆2 =
∆ : K → K ⊗ K, ∆i = (idK ⊗ ∆i−1 )∆. The specification of a ∼-twisting
cochain φ : K → M is equivalent to that of a mapping of differential coalgebra
fφ : (K, d) → B̃(M, {mi }). For any (K, d) and ((M, {mi }), (P, {pi })) ∈ M (∞)
any ∼-twisting cochain φ : K → M on the tensor product K ⊗ P determines by
∂φ = d ⊗ idP +

a differential, turning (K ⊗ P, ∂φ ) into a differential comodule over (K, d); this
differential comodule is called the ∼-twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P . If M is an
A(∞)-algebra of the form (M, {m1 , m2 , 0, 0, ...}), and P is an A(∞)-module of
the form (P, {p1 , p2 , 0, 0, ...}), then φ is the usual twisting cochain, and K ⊗φ P
coincides with the usual twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P .
We need the concept of equivalence of twisting cochains (see [4], [5], [6]). We
say that φ, ψ : K → C are equivalent if there is a homomorphism c : K → C of
degree 0 for which c0 = c|C0 = 0 and ψ = (1 + c) ⋆ φ where
(1 + c) ⋆ φ = (1 + ĉ) · φ · (1 + c)−1 − (cd + ∂c) · (1 + c)−1 ;
φ ∼ ψ if and only if fφ , fψ : K → B are homotopic in the sense of [2] (coderivation homotopy): fφ − fψ = ∂D + D∂ with (D ⊗ fψ + fˆφ ⊗ D)∆ = ∆D.
Theorem 3 If (K, d) is a differential coalgebra with free Ki , and φ : K → C is
an arbitrary twisting cochain, then
cochain φ∗ : K →
P∞ there exists a ∼-twisting
∗ ∗
i
H(C) such that φ and f φ = i=1 fi (φ ∗ ⊗... ⊗ φ∗)∆ are equivalent.

Proof. To construct φ∗ we prove the following inductive assertion: for any
i > 0 there exists a twisting cochain φ(i) : K → C and a homomorphisms
φ∗i : Ki → Hi−1 (C) and ci : Ki → Ci such that
P
P
(a) φ∗i d = it=2 S(t,i) Xt (φ∗k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ∗kt )∆t ;
(b) φ(i) = (1 + ci ) ⋆ φ(i−1) ;
Pi P
(i)
(c) φi = t=1 S(t,i) ft (φ∗k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ∗kt )∆t .
For i = 1 we take φ∗1 = {φ1 }. Since the difference (φ1 − f1 φ∗1 )(k) is homologous to zero for each k ∈ K1 and K1 is free, we obtain a homomorphism
c1 : K1 → C1 for which −∂c1 = φ1 − f1 φ∗1 . We define φ(1) = (1 + c1 ) ⋆ φ, so
(1)
φ1 = φ1 + ∂c1 = f1 φ∗1 . Suppose now that φ(i) , φ∗i , and ci have already been
constructed in such a way that (a), (b), and (c) hold for i < n. Let
Wn = φn(n−1) −

n X
X

ft (φ∗k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ∗kt )∆t ;

t=2 S(t,n)

A direct check shows that ∂Wn = 0; we define φ∗n = {Wn }. Since the difference
Wn − f1 φ∗n is homological to zero and Kn is free, we can construct a cn : Kn →
Cn such that −∂cn = Wn − f1 φ∗n ; let φ(n) = (1 + cn ) ⋆ φ(n−1) . Then
(n−1)
+ ∂cn = f1 φ∗n − Wn =
φ(n)
n = φn

ft (φ∗k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ∗kt )∆t ,

t=1 S(t,n)

consequently, (b) and (c) hold for φ(n) , φ∗n , and
Pcn , and the validity of (a) can be
checked directly. From (a) we see that φ∗ = i φ∗i is a ∼-twisting cochain, and
from (b) and (c) we deduce that f ∗ φ∗ = φ∞ , where φ∞ = Πi (1 + ci ) ⋆ φ ∼ φ.
It follows from Theorem 3 that for any differential coalgebra mapping g :
K → B there exists a G∗ : K → B̃(H(C), {Xi }) for which g and f g ∗ are
homotopic in the sense of [2]. This assertion implies uniqueness mentioned above
for the structure of homology A(∞)-algebra: if (H(C), {Xi }) and (H(C), {X i })
are two structures of homology A(∞)-algebra on H(C), then by taking K =
B̃(H(C), {X i }) and g = f : B̃(H(C), {X i }) → B(C), we obtain a
g ∗ : B̃(H(C), {X i }) → B̃(H(C), {Xi })
for which f g ∗ ∼ g. Then the first component of the A(∞)algebra morphism
{gi∗ } : (H(C), {X i }) → (H(C), {Xi }) induced by g ∗ is g1∗ = idH(C) , and this
implies that {gi∗ } is an isomorphism in A(∞).
The next result follows from Theorems 1, 2 and 3.
Corollary 2 K ⊗φ D and K ⊗φ∗ H(D) have isomorphic homology under the
conditions of Theorems 1, 2 and 3.
The results obtained have the following applications.
The first proposition is obtained from Corollary 1 by taking C = C̄∗ (G),
where G is a connected topological group such that the Hi (G) are free, bearing
in mind that H(B(C)) = H∗ (BG ).
6

Proposition 1 The homology of the B̃-construction B̃(H̄∗ (G), {Xi }) are isomorphic to that of classifying space BG .
The next proposition is obtained from Corollary 1 by taking C = C ∗ (B, b0 ),
where B is a simply connected space with free groups H i (B, b0 ), and bearing in
mind that H(B(C)) = H ∗ (ΩC).
Proposition 2 The homology of the B̃-construction B̃(H̄ ∗ (B, b0 ), {Xi }) are
isomorphic to the cohomology of the loop space ΩB.
Let ξ = (X, p, B, G) be a principal G-fibration with paracompact base and
connected G, let F be a G-space, and ξ[F ] = (E, p, B, F, G) the associated fiber
bundle, with the Hi (G) and H(i (F ) free. The final proposition is obtained from
Corollary 2 ty taking C = C∗ (G), D = C∗ (F ), and φ a twisting cochain of the
fibration ξ ([3]).
Proposition 3 The homology of the ∼-twisted tensor product C∗ (B)⊗φ∗ H∗ (F )
is isomorphic to that of E.
This proposition generalize a result of Shih [7]: if G is (n − 1)-connected,
then the components φ∗i ∈ C i (B, Hi−1 (G)) vanish for 0 < i < n + 1, therefore,
the differentials di of the spectral sequence of ξ[F ] are trivial for 1 < i < n + 1,
and the components are cocycles for n < i < 2n + 1, consequently, dj can be
expressed for n < i < 2n + 1 in terms of certain characteristic classes of ξ and
the operation Y2 : H∗ (G) ⊗ H∗ (F ) → H∗ (F ); we remark that higher operations
Yi are needed for computing dj , j > 2n, in terms of φ∗ .
Theorems 1, 2 and Proposition 3 were announced in [8] and Proposition 2
in [9].
