We present the design for an absorbing metamaterial element with near unity absorbance. Our
structure consists of two metamaterial resonators that couple separately to electric and magnetic
fields so as to absorb all incident radiation within a single unit cell layer. We fabricate, characterize, and analyze a metamaterial absorber with a slightly lower predicted absorbance of 96%.
This achieves a simulated full width at half maximum (FWHM) absorbance of 4% thus making
this material ideal for imaging purposes. Unlike conventional absorbers, our metamaterial consists
solely of metallic elements. The underlying substrate can therefore be chosen independently of the
substrate’s absorptive qualities and optimized for other parameters of interest. We detail the design and simulation process that led to our metamaterial, and our experiments demonstrate a peak
absorbance greater than 88% at 11.5 GHz.

The nascent field of electromagnetic metamaterials has
produced exotic effects such as negative index of refraction [1, 2], and devices such as an electromagnetic
cloak [3]. The realization of such properties lies in the
ability of metamaterials to create independent tailored
electric [4] and magnetic [5] responses to incident radiation. Electromagnetic metamaterials are also geometrically scalable which translates into operability over a significant portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. To date
metamaterials have been demonstrated in every technologically relevant spectral range, from radio [6], microwave [7], mm-Wave [8], THz [9], MIR [10], NIR [11],
to the near optical [12]. These designer electromagnetic
materials are an ideal platform for the investigation of
novel emergent physical phenomena while also holding
great promise for future applications.
As an effective medium [13], metamaterials can be
characterized by a complex electric permittivity ˜(ω) =
1 + i2 and magnetic permeability µ̃(ω) = µ1 + iµ2 .
Much of the work in metamaterials has been focussed
on the real part of  and µ to enable the creation of a
negative refractive material. However, the oft-overlooked
loss components of the optical constants (2 and µ2 ) have
much potential for the creation of exotic and useful materials as well. For example, they can be manipulated
to create a high absorber. By manipulating electric and
magnetic resonances independently, it is possible to absorb both the incident electric and magnetic field. Additionally, by matching  and µ, a metamaterial can be
impedance-matched to free space, minimizing reflectivity. In this paper, we show that metamaterials can be
fashioned to create narrow-band perfect absorbers, with
the potential to be used in devices such as in bolometers.
A single unit cell of the absorber consisted of two dis-

tinct metallic elements as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b).
Electric coupling was supplied by the electric ring resonator (ERR), similar to the design presented by Padilla
et al. [14], and is shown in Fig. 1 (a). This element consisted of two standard split ring resonators connected by
the inductive ring parallel to the split-wire. We used this
design instead of a conventional split-wire design because
of the limitations of straight wire media [15], i.e. a splitwire design has limited tunability beyond the addition of
more wires per unit cell to increase inductance [16]. The
magnetic coupling required a more complicated arrangement, and thus in order to couple to the incident H-field,

the right axis as the blue curve on a scale from zero to 5%.

we needed flux created by circulating charges perpendicular to the propagation vector. We created this response
by combining the center wire of the electric resonator
with a cut wire (Fig. 1(b)) in a parallel plane separated
by a substrate (Fig. 1(c)). This design is similar to the
so-called “fishnet” and paired nanorod structures[11, 12],
in the sense that they derive a magnetic response from
driving two antiparallel currents in conducting segments.
We were then able to tune the magnetic response by
changing the geometry of the cut wire and the separation between the cut wire and electric resonator. By manipulating the magnetic coupling without changing the
geometry of the electric resonator, we able to decouple 
and µ, and therefore individually tune each resonance.
We performed computer simulations of an ideal – but
realizable – metamaterial absorber using the commercial
finite-difference time domain (FDTD) solver Microwave
Studio by CST.[17] The program simulated a single unit
cell as shown in Fig. 1 (c) with appropriate boundary conditions, i.e. perfect electric (ŷẑ-plane) and perfect magnetic (x̂ẑ-plane). Waveguide ports on the other
boundaries simulated a TEM plane wave propagating
through the medium. Simulation produced the complex
frequency dependent S-parameters, Se11 and Se21 , where
T (ω) = |S21 |2 and R(ω) = |S11 |2 are the transmission
and reflectance, respectively. From the S-parameter data
we inverted the fresnel equations to extract the complex
optical constants[18]. We then examined the behavior of
the surface current density, magnetic and electric fields
at ω0 to verify that we were coupling to the correct resonant mode of each metamaterial element. By tuning
ω0 of the  and µ resonances (not shown), due to the
two metamaterial elements, we achieved  = µ and thus

an impedance near the free space value. While 100%
asborbance is theoretically possible, it can only occur
when the metamaterial layer is impedance-matched to
free space such that the reflectance is zero.[19] One may
then minimize transmission such that the addition of
multiple layers ensures T (ω) → 0. The simulated metamaterial had the dimensions, in millimeters, of: a1 =4.2,
a2 =12, W=3.9, G=0.606, t=0.6, L=1.7, H=11.8, and the
metamaterials elements were separated by 0.65 in the ẑ
direction. In Fig. 2 we show the simulation results for
the metamaterial perfect absorber. Reflectance and absorbance are plotted from zero to 100% (left axis) and
the transmission is plotted on the right axis from zero
to 5%. The reflectance is large ∼ 97% near the bounds
of the plot, 9GHz and 14GHz, but there is a minimum
of 0.01% at ω0 ≡ 11.65GHz. The simulated transmission also undergoes a minimum near ω0 and yields a
value of ∼ 0.9%. Thus we achieve a best simulated absorbance A(ω) = 1 − T (ω) − R(ω) slightly less than unity
A(ω) = 99% with a FWHM of 4% compared to ω0 .
While our simulated absorber achieves narrow-band
high absorbance, we were restricted by the minimum line
widths available to us (250 µm) and other various fabrication tolerances. These limitations were incorporated
into the design process and we fabricated a metamaterial which deviated slightly from the ideal absorber and
had the dimensions, in millimeters, of: a1 =4.2, a2 =12,
W=4, G=0.6, t=0.6, L=1.7, H=11.8. Each metallization was fabricated on a FR4 substrate with a thickness
of 0.2mm. Metamaterials were fabricated using standard
optical lithography. Photosensitized half-ounce copperclad FR-4 circuit board formed the substrate material
with an 17 µm copper thickness. A mask was designed
and printed in high resolution on a transparency. The
photosensitized copper clad FR-4 was covered by the
mask and exposed to ultraviolet light then developed in
a sodium carbonate solution and etched in ferric chloride. Finally, the board was placed in a stripper solution to remove the remaining photoresist. Both the
ERR layer (Fig. 1(a)) and the cut-wire layer (Fig. 1(b))
were fabricated in such a fashion, see inset to Fig. 3 (b).
These boards where then sandwiched (using an adhesive
with 0.06mm thickness) about another 0.2mm thick FR4
blank substrate to obtain the correct spacing. The end
results was that the metamaterials elements were separated by 0.72mm in the ẑ direction. This design allowed
us to couple to both magnetic and electric resonances
without using out-of-plane elements typical with “winecrate” designs,[2] thus greatly simplifying construction of
the absorber.
We experimentally verified the behavior of the absorber by measuring the complex S-parameters of a large
planar array of pixels (outer dimensions of 15 × 15 cm).
We used an Agilent vector network analyzer that produced microwaves in the range of 8-12 GHz. One microwave horn (Rozendal and Associates) focused the GHz

simulated and measured reflectance from zero to 100%. A
schematic of the reflection experiment is shown as the inset

measured transmission, shown in (b), are displayed from zero
to 10%. Both reach a minimum of approximately 0.6% near
11.5 GHz. Inset to (b) shows photographs of the individual
components which make up the metamaterial absorber. The

beam on the sample and another horn served as a detector. Both horns coupled to linearly polarized light and
had parallel polarization directions. To measure transmission, we set the horns in a normal incidence confocal
configuration. We performed reflectance measurements
at normal incidence. However, in order to eliminate large
voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) which would overwhelm the data, we used a beam splitter configuration,
shown as the inset to Fig. 3 (a). Radiation first traveled
from the transmitting horn through the beam splitter,
reflected from the sample and returned to the beam splitter where it was reflected at 45% to the receiving horn.
We set the normalization and phase in the transmission
configuration by simply removing the sample. For reflection, we replaced the sample with a perfect reflector
for normalized measurements. Transmission characterization techniques utilized here have been described elsewhere in detail[20].
Computer simulations were performed for this metamaterial structure and are presented for comparison to
experimental data. The simulated R(ω) is shown as the

FIG. 4: Main panel shows the simulated (red) and measured
(blue) absorbance curves. Significant broadening in the reflection curve contributes to the deviation of the experimental absorbance curve from simulation. The dashed gray absorbance

red curve in Fig. 3 (a). At low frequencies the reflectivity
is high and yields values near 95%. A large feature occurs in R(ω) and has a minimum of ∼ 3% near 11.5 GHz.
Likewise the simulated transmissivity, shown as the red
curve in Fig. 3 (b), has 4% T (ω) at low frequencies and
then undergoes a minimum near 11.25 GHz. The simulated absorbance of our metamaterial unit cell thus has
a maximum near where both R(ω) and T (ω) have their
minima. We plot A(ω) as the red curve in Fig. 4 from 8
to 12 GHz. The simulated A(ω) peaks at 96% at 11.48
GHz and has a FWHM of 4% with respect to its center
frequency.
By performing simulations for transmissivity and reflectivity, we are able to account for the form of the experimental data. The measured R(ω) and T (ω) are plotted as the blue curves in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) respectively.
We find excellent agreement between simulated and measured T(ω) over all frequencies characterized. The measured reflectance is consistently 8% lower than the simulated R(ω) at low frequencies. Both the simulated and
experimental R(ω) reach a minimum at approximately
11.5 GHz, but experimentally the minimum is 11%, as
opposed to the simulated value of 3%. There is also significant broadening in the experimental reflectivity curve
with respect to simulation. This is most likely due to
tolerances in the fabrication and assembly.
The experimental absorbance calculated from T (ω)
and R(ω) is shown as the blue curve in Fig. 4. The
simulated and experimental curves have maximum absorbance at the same frequency, ωmax =11.5 GHz. How-

ever, the simulated curve reaches a maximum of 96% and
the experimental curve only reaches 88%. The difference between the simulated and measured curves is due
primarily to deviations in R(ω). Better fabrication and
assembly tolerances will permit absorbances and bandwidths similar to that shown as the red curve in Fig.
4. We performed computer simulations to verify the origin of the broadening of A(ω). From a theoretical viewpoint it is expected that the frequency location of the
absorbance peak depends significantly upon the separation between the electric ring resonator and the cut-wire,
since this distance determines the frequency location of
the magnetic resonance. Computer simulations verified
this conjecture. We simulated various spacings centered
about the designed value of 0.72mm, and computed a
Gaussian weighted average A(ω) with a standard deviation of σ =20 µm. The absorbance calculated in this
manner agrees very well with the experimental curve and
is plotted as the grey dashed curve in the main panel of
Fig. 4. Thus assembly errors in the metamaterial spacing of only 5% can easily account for the disagreement
between the simulation and experiment shown in Fig. 4
as the red and blue curves, respectively.
An investigation into the effect of adding multiple
metamaterial absorbing layers is shown in the main panel
of Fig. 5. As can be observed the absorbance rises
sharply with additional layers and is asymptotic to unity,
within computational noise. Two layers of the metamaterial absorber achieve a value of ∼99.9972%. At this
thickness the entire metamaterial is only ∼ λ0 /2 at resonance. For the structure shown in Fig. 1, A(ω0 ) can
never reach unity since the metamaterial is not perfectly
matched to free space. However, it is important to note

that although an impedance matched structure may yield
zero R(ω0 ), this does not necessarily mean the transmission will be small. In this study we are interested
in achieving R(ω0 )=T(ω0 )=0 in a single unit cell in the
propagation direction. Thus our metamaterial structure
was optimized to maximize the absorbance with the restriction of minimizing the thickness. If this constraint is
relaxed, however, an impedance matched condition can
be obtained and with multiple layers a perfect absorbance
can be achieved.
We further investigated the origin of the loss in our
metamaterial structure, as indicated in the inset to Fig.
5. The Ohmic “surface” loss originates mainly from the
center conducting region of the electric ring resonator,
and dielectric losses primarily occur in-between the two
metamaterial elements where the electric field is large.
The major component responsible for the absorbance in
our metamaterial structure is the dielectric loss and simulation indicates this is an order of magnitude greater than
Ohmic losses. This is consistent with previous studies of
frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) where it was found
that metallic absorption was relatively insignificant in
comparison to dielectric losses.[21]
We now discuss the potential application of a perfect
metamaterial absorber as a bolometer. An ideal bolometric detector is one in which all photons that fall upon
its surface are absorbed, converted to heat, and thus
sensed.[22] A prominent feature of commercially available bolometers is their extreme bandwidth making them
ideal candidates as detectors, especially in the far infrared frequency regime where other efficient detection
methods are largely unavailable. However, bolometers
which achieve a narrowband response also have significant application as focal plane array detectors for imaging. The metamaterial design presented here achieves
simulated absorbtivities near unity making them ideal
candidates for bolometric pixel elements. The natural narrowband metamaterial resonance is a salient feature for focal plane array detectors as it is naturally
apodizing and operates at room temperature. Since
the elements which constitute our bolometer are subwavelength, metamaterials can inherently image at the
diffraction limit. Further, here we have used only a single unit cell in the propagation direction, (with a thickness significantly smaller than the wavelength λ0 /35), yet
achieved an experimental absorbance of 88%. By adding
multiple layers one can achieve narrowband absorptivities of unity. Although the design is planar and A(ω)
should fall off relatively rapidly, we investigated the angular dependence (inset to Fig. 4) and found the metamaterial still achieved 50% absorbance at an incident
full-angle of 16◦ . Finally, the scalability of metamaterials permits the usage of these perfect absorbers at other
wavelengths of interest such as the possibility of room
temperature high resolution imaging at mm-Wave and
THz frequencies. This is particularly interesting owing to

5
the many possible applications. We have designed similar metamaterials (not shown) as in Fig. 1 that achieved
comparable A(ω) to that shown in Fig. 2 operating at
94 GHz and 1 THz.
While the creation of a metamaterial absorber is novel,
the technology to create highly absorptive materials in
the microwave frequency range is well-established. The
material “chiroshield” is capable of very high absorption,
and reduces backscatter by 15 to 25 dB [23]. Chiroshield,
however, has geometries on the order of one wavelength,
which is 35 times larger than our design at a given center
frequency. Some ferrites show reflection loss of -30 dB
[24]. These ferrites, however, lack the inherent and precise tunability of metamaterials. Other work has been
done on the application of frequency-selective materials
to bolometric devices. These bolometric designs, however, require cryogenic temperatures to operate and only
achieve absorbances of about 50%[25]. At optical wavelengths, metal colloides are known to have large absorptive properties,[26] due to the geometric specific surface
modes[27]. This suggests and interesting possible application of artificial plasmonic wire media[4] shaped into
particular geometries to function as perfect absorbers[16]
operating at microwave frequencies.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that metamaterials can be highly absorptive over a narrow frequency
range. This stems from the ability to design metamaterial elements which can individually absorb the electric
and magnetic components of an incident electromagnetic
wave. In contrast previous experimental results at THz
frequencies using a single type of metamaterial element
(electric) yielded values of only A(ω)=∼ 20%.[28] The
resonant frequency of the metamaterial elements may
be tuned throughout some range of frequencies [29, 30]
thus enabling hyperspectral imaging. A further benefit
afforded by metamaterials is the ability to construct a
single unit cell with µ(ω) = (ω) over an extended frequency range. Thus this unit cell can achieve zero reflectance since it can p
have an impedance equal to the
free space value Z = µ/ = 1. This is similar to the
well known theoretical construct, the Perfectly Matched
Layer (PML) Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABC),[31]
which splits waves incident upon a boundary into electric
and magnetic components to obtain near perfect absorbtion. The PML, however, requires gain and additionally
is on the order of λ0 /2 in thickness[32].
The design presented here can still be improved. By
incorporating a substrate with a highly consistent dielectric constant, we will be able to optimize the design at
the correct resonant frequency. Similarly, tighter fabrication tolerances would allow us to bring the impedance
closer to unity and therefore closer to 100% absorption.
More progress could also be made on the design itself.
Currently, the absorber is polarization sensitive, which
is not ideal for some applications. Additionally, the assembly is complicated due the restrictions placed on the

direction of the incident wave to couple to the magnetic
resonator. This resulted in variations between unit cells
and less distinct absorbance peak.
