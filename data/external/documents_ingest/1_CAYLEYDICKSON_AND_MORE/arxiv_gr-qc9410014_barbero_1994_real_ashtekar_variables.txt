ABSTRACT

I suggest in this letter a new strategy to attack the problem of the reality conditions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum general relativity. By writing
a modified Hamiltonian constraint in the usual SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space I show
that it is possible to describe space-times with Lorentzian signature without the introduction of complex variables. All the features of the Ashtekar formalism related to
the geometrical nature of the new variables are retained; in particular, it is still possible, in principle, to use the loop variables approach in the passage to the quantum
theory. The key issue in the new formulation is how to deal with the more complicated Hamiltonian constraint that must be used in order to avoid the introduction of
complex fields.

The purpose of this letter is to suggest a new strategy to deal with the problem
of the reality conditions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum gravity.
At the present moment there is some consensus about the reasons behind the success
of the Ashtekar variables program [1]. One of them is the geometrical nature of the
new variables. In particular, the fact that the configuration variable is a connection
is specially interesting because this allows us to use loop variables both at the classical and quantum level [2]. Another advantage of the formalism is the simplicity of
the constraints –specially the Hamiltonian constraint– that has been very helpful in
finding solutions to all of them. There are, however, some difficulties in the formalism
that must be solved and are not present in the traditional ADM scheme [3]. The most
conspicuous one is the fact that complex variables must be used in order to describe
Lorentzian signature space-times. This is often put in relation with the fact that the
definition of self-duality in these space-times demands the introduction of imaginary
coefficients. The now accepted way to deal with this issue is the introduction of reality conditions. They impose some consistency requirements on the scalar product in
the Hilbert space of physical states. In fact, the hope is that this scalar product can
be selected by the reality conditions. There are, however some difficulties with this
approach too. Specifically it is very difficult to implement the reality conditions in
the loop variables scheme. Only recently some positive results in this direction have
been reported [6]. The main point of this letter is to consider the geometrical nature
of the Ashtekar variables as the most important asset of the formalism. With this
idea in mind, it is easy to see that the introduction of complex variables is necessary
only if one wants to have an specially simple form for the Hamiltonian constraint. If
we accept to live with a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint in the Ashtekar
phase space we can use real variables.
An interesting consequence of this, as emphasized by Rovelli and Smolin, is that
all the results obtained within the loop variables approach (existence of volume and

1

area observables, weave states and so on [4], [5]) whose derivation is independent
of the particular form of the scalar constraint scalar can be maintained even for
Lorentzian signature space-times because it is possible to describe Lorentzian gravity
with real fields in the Ashtekar phase space. More specifically, the issue is not the
implementation of the reality conditions (at least at the kinematical) but rather the
construction of a scalar product, normalizability of the quantum physical states and
so on. The proposal presented in this letter does not address this problems. It must
also be said that the construction of area and volume observables referred to above
must still be put in a completely sound and rigorous mathematical basis that may very
well be provided by the approach presented in [6] to incorporate the reality conditions
in the loop variables approach by using a generalization of th e Bargmann-Siegel
transform to spaces of connections. This letter has nothing to add with respect to
this. In the following, tangent space indices and SO(3) indices will be represented by
lowercase Latin letters from the beginning and the middle of the alphabet respectively.
The 3-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor density and its inverse will be denoted1 by
η̃ abc and ηabc and the internal SO(3) Levi-Civita tensor by ǫijk . The variables in
˜
the SO(3)-ADM phase space (ADM formalism with internal SO(3) symmetry as
˜ and its
discussed in [7]) are a densitized triad Ẽia (with determinant denoted by Ẽ)
canonically conjugate object Kai (closely related to the extrinsic curvature). The
(densitized) three dimensional metric built from the triad will be denoted
Ẽia Ẽ bi and its determinant q̃˜ so that q ab =

q̃˜ab ≡

q̃˜ab
. I will use also the SO(3) connection
q̃˜

Γia compatible with the triad. The variables in the Ashtekar phase space are Ẽia ,
again, and the SO(3) connection Aia . The curvatures of Aia and Γia are respectively
i
i
given by Fab
≡ 2∂[a Aib] + ǫi jk Aja Akb and Rab
≡ 2∂[a Γib] + ǫi jk Γja Γkb . Finally, the action of

the covariant derivatives defined by these connections on internal indices are2 ∇a λi =
1

I represent the density weights by the usual convention of using tildes above and below the fields.
They may be extended to act on tangent indices, if necessary, by introducing a space-time
torsion-free connection; for example the Christoffel connection Γcab built from q ab . All the results
presented in the paper will be independent of such extension

∂a λi + ǫijk Aja λk and Da λi = ∂a λi + ǫijk Γja λk . The compatibility of Γia and Ẽia thus
means Da Ẽib ≡ ∂a Ẽib + ǫi jk Γaj Ẽkb + Γbac Ẽic − Γcac Ẽib = 0.
I will start from the SO(3)-ADM constraints

The parameter ζ is used to control the space-time signature. For Lorentzian signatures
we have ζ = −1 whereas in the Euclidean case we have ζ = +1. The constraints (1)
generate internal SO(3) rotations, diffeomorphisms and time evolution. I write now
the usual canonical transformation to the Ashtekar phase space
Ẽia = Ẽia

Aia = Γia + βKai

and thus, the transformation is canonical. Introducing (3, 4) in the constraints (1)
we get immediately the following constraints in the Ashtekar phase space

They are the Gauss law, vector and scalar constraints of the Ashtekar formulation.
The traditional attitude with regard to (8) has been to consider that the last term
introduces unnecessary complications in the formalism. For this reason it has always
been cancelled by choosing β such that β 2 ζ − 1 = 0. For Euclidean signatures
we can take β 2 = 1 and remain within the limits of the real theory. For Lorentzian
signatures, however, we are forced to take β 2 = −1 and then the variables (specifically
the connection) cease to be real. It must be emphasized that this is true only if we
insist in cancelling the last term in (8). If we accept to keep it, there is no reason to
introduce complex objects in the theory. The value of β (as long as it is different from
zero) is also irrelevant so we can choose β = −1 and have the following Hamiltonian
constraint in the Lorentzian case
ǫijk Ẽia Ẽjb Fabk − 4Ẽ[ia Ẽj]b (Aia − Γia )(Ajb − Γjb ) = 0

The relevant Poisson bracket in (5) becomes
n

o

Aia (x), Ẽjb (y) = δji δab δ 3 (x, y)

(10)

Since we have obtained this result by performing a canonical transformation, the
Poisson algebra of the constraints is preserved. If we define the functionals

{S[N ], S[M ]} = +V [Ẽia Ẽ bi (N ∂b M − M ∂b N )]

(12)

The + sign in the right-hand side of (12) shows that we have, indeed, Lorentzian
signature. It is possible to rewrite (9) in a more appealing form. The second term,
in particular, can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives of Ẽia . To this end I
Ẽ a

introduce the inverse of √i˜

The last term in the previous formula is still quadratic in the connections but its
dependence on Ẽia is complicated. It must be noted also that if we restrict ourselves
to non-degenerate triads it can be cast in polynomial form (of degree 8 in Ẽia ) by
˜ If one is interested in checking explicitly the
multiplying it by the square of Ẽ.
Poisson algebra and use the Hamiltonian constraint (14), it is useful to notice that
eai [Ẽ] and −2η̃ abc ∇b eci are canonically conjugate objects. This may eventually be
useful in order to write the new Hamiltonian constraint in terms of loop variables
maybe by allowing us to extend the set of T-variables with objects built out of eai [Ẽ]
and −2η̃ abc ∇b eci .
There is another appealing way to write a Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian
general relativity in terms of real Ashtekar variables. One starts by writing the
5

Now, in the Lorentzian case we can choose β 2 = 1 and cancel the last term to give

(17)

remembering now that

we can finally write the Hamiltonian constraint as3
ǫijk Ẽia Ẽjb (Fabk − 2Rabk ) = 0

(18)

The geometrical interpretation of the term that we must add to the familiar Hamiltonian constraint in the Ashtekar formulation in order to describe Lorentzian gravity
in the Ashtekar phase space is simpler than in (14); it is just the curvature of the
SO(3) connection compatible with the triad Ẽia . Some comments are now in order.
First, the presence of a potential term in (14) and (18) certainly makes them more
complicated than the familiar Ashtekar Hamiltonian constraint. Taking into account
that one of the sources of difficulties in the ADM formalism is precisely the presence
of a potential term in the Hamiltonian constraint (see [9] and references therein for
examples on how the quantization of ADM gravity would simplify in the absence of
such a term) it is fair to expect some difficulties in the treatment of the theory with
this new Hamiltonian constraint. The simplification brought about by removing the
reality conditions has been traded for a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint.
3
It is my understanding that this formulation was independently considered by Ashtekar [8] before
the loop variables formalism had been introduced, and discarded due to the presence of the potential
term.

6

The way the difference between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases arises is rather
interesting; there is potential term in the Lorentzian case that is absent in the Euclidean formulation. This asymmetry between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases
is somehow puzzling. Why is it that the ”complicated formulation” is found for the
Lorentzian case? In the ADM formalism such an asymmetry is not apparent in the
formalism.
The fact that the theory is written in an SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space makes it
possible to attempt its quantization by using loop variables. This can be achieved in
principle because we know [10] that loop variables are good coordinates (modulo sets
of measure zero) in the (Gauss law reduced) constraint hypersurface. The key problem
is now how to write the potential term in terms of the familiar loop variables. The
obvious solution would be to add additional objects built with traces of holonomies
of the connection Γia , notice, however, that it is not straightforward to add them
to the set of elementary variables T 0 and T 1 because this would spoil the closure
under the Poisson brackets. It is worthwhile noting that the possibility of writing the
Hamiltonian constraint for real Lorentzian general relativity in the two alternative
forms (14) and (18) may be useful when trying to write them in terms of loop variables.
It is conceivable that one form may be simpler to deal with than the other.
The form of the constraints of the theory makes it possible to use an approach
similar to that of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson in [11] to solve both the vector and
scalar constraints. We define, for non degenerate triads, the matrix ψij as
ψij Ẽja = B̃ia − 2R̃ia

(19)

B̃ic ≡ η̃ abc Fabi

(20)

R̃ic ≡ η̃ abc Rabi

(21)

where

7

the scalar constraint is then
˜
ǫijk ηabc Ẽia Ẽjb ψkl Ẽlc = 2 Ẽtrψ
= 0 =⇒ trψ = 0
˜

(22)

The vector constraint can be rewritten now as
[a

i
i
Ẽia (Fab
− 2Rab
) = 0 ⇐⇒ Ẽi (B̃ b]i − 2R̃b]i ) = 0

(23)

i
because the relation Rab
= − 12 ǫijk Rabc d ejc ekd and the Bianchi identity R[abc]d = 0 (the
i
three dimensional Riemann tensor built with q ab ) imply that Ẽia Rab
= 0. We have

then
[a

b]

Ẽi Ẽj ψij = 0 =⇒ ψ[ij] = 0

(24)

so that a symmetric and traceless ψij solves both the vector and scalar constraints. As
in the usual case we are left with one last equation: the Gauss law. Here is where the
main difference between the usual Hamiltonian constraint and (18) arises. Without
the potential term of (18) we could very easily write the remaining equation in terms
of Aai and ψij
∇a [ψij−1 B̃ja ] = 0

(25)

Now the situation is more complicated because we are forced to consider a system of
coupled PDE’s
∇a [ψij−1 (B̃ja − 2R̃ja )] = 0

(26)

ψij Ẽja = B̃ia − 2R̃ia

(27)

The second equation could be solved, in principle, for Ẽia and then the first would
become an equation for ψij and Aia only as in (25).
The main result presented in this letter has been the introduction of several alternative forms for the Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian space-times in the Ashtekar
formalism with real variables. The problem of implementing the reality conditions in
the theory has been transformed into the problem of working with the new Hamiltonian constraints introduced here.
8

The previous results strongly suggest that Lorentzian general relativity is a theory
of two SO(3) connections (in the sense that both the curvatures of Aia and Γia seem
to be playing a role as is apparent in (18)). A completely different two-connection
formulation for both Euclidean and Lorentzian general relativity has been reported
elsewhere [12]. In that formulation the main difference between the Euclidean and
Lorentzian cases is the appearance of terms depending on the difference of the curvatures for the Lorentzian signature case. The fact that, even for Lorentzian signatures,
the Hamiltonian constraint of that formulation is a low order polynomial of the curvatures makes it suitable to be written in terms of loop variables built with the two
connections. My hope is that the comparison of the several different approaches
discussed above may provide useful information about the way to proceed with the
quantization program for general relativity and the role of complex fields in it.
