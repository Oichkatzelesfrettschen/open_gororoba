Abstract. We prove that the range of sequence of vector measures
converging widely satisﬁes a weak lower semicontinuity property, that
the convergence of the range implies the strict convergence (convergence
of the total variation) and that the strict convergence implies the range
convergence for strictly convex norms. In dimension 2 and for Euclidean
spaces of any dimensions, we prove that the total variation of a vector
measure is monotone with respect to the range.

1. Introduction
A vector measure µ maps some Σ–measurable subsets of a space X to
vectors in a linear space V [1, Chapter 1; 8; 13]. Vector measures appear naturally in calculus of variations and in geometric measure theory,
as derivatives of functions of bounded variation (BV) [6] and as currents of
finite mass [10]. In these contexts, it is natural to work with sequences of
finite Radon measures and to study their convergence.
The wide convergence of a sequence (µn )n∈N of finite vector measures
to some finite vector measure µ is defined by the condition that for every
compactly supported continuous test function ϕ ∈ Cc (X, R), one has

The strict convergence, which requires the total variation to converge also,
is an important concept that brings one back into a setting similar to tight
sequences of probability measures.
The total variation of a vector measure µ is defined in terms of a seminorm
|·|V on V by
|µ|V (X) , sup

(

X

)

|µ(E)|V : P is a finite Σ–measurable partition of X .

E∈P

For real-valued signed Radon measures, V = R and the mass depends only,
up to a constant positive multiple, on the vector structure of the space V .
This is not any more the case when V is a finite-dimensional vector space
of dimension greater than 1 (dim V > 1). The norms on the space V are
all equivalent, but induce total variations whose values are not connected
mutually beyond the bounds given by equivalence of seminorms.
This lack of connection between various total variations is the starting
question of the present work. Reshetnyak [16] and Delladio [7] have proved
that strict convergence with respect to a strictly convex norm is a sufficient
assumption to obtain strict convergence with respect to any another norm
on V (see also [21] for the mass with respect to a Euclidean norm).
In order to characterize strict convergence through a topological object,
independent of a choice of norm, we propose to describe strict convergence
with the range of a vector measure µ, which is defined as 1
rg µ (X) , conv µ(A) : A ∈ Σ .
In particular, when V = R, we have
(1.1)



rg µ (X) = [µ− (X), µ+ (X)],

where µ = µ+ + µ− , with µ+ ≥ 0, µ− ≤ 0, and µ+ and µ− are mutually
singular, so that for any widely converging sequence of vector measures,
the convergence of the range is equivalent with the convergence of the mass
[5, Appendix C].
In general, the range of a vector measure characterizes uniquely the total
variation of a measure [18]. This result is stable under convergence as the
range convergence implies in general the mass convergence:
Theorem 1.1. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space endowed
with its Borel σ-algebra B(X), let V be a finite-dimensional space and let
|·|V be a seminorm on V . If (µn )n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures
from X to V that converges widely to some vector Borel measure µ, and
if the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff
distance, then
lim |µn |V (X) = |µ|V (X).
n→∞

The assumption on the convergence is described in terms of Hausdorff distance; this choice is in practice inconsequential: since the space V is finitedimensional, the Hausdorff convergence of compact convex sets is equivalent
1Classically, the range of a vector measure is deﬁned [8] as the closure of the set

{µ(A) : A ⊂ X is Σ–measurable}. This deﬁnition coincides with ours as soon as µ has no
atoms [8, Corollary 9.5; 14]. Our notion has the advantage of being always a convex set
and is natural in view of the link between range and the total variation [18, Theorem 3].

to the Kuratowski convergence and to the convergence of the support functions [20, Corollaries 3A and P4.A] (see also [15]).
The converse statement of Theorem 1.1 does not hold in general. In fact,
the strict convexity of the norm appears as a necessary condition to have
range convergence:
Proposition 1.2. If the locally compact separable metric space X is not
discrete and if the seminorm |·|V is not strictly convex, then there exists a
sequence (µn )n∈N of Borel vector measures from X to V converging widely
to some vector measure µ such that (|µn |V (X))n∈N converges to |µ|V (X) but
(rg µn (X))n∈N is constant and different from rg µ (X).
We prove that strict convexity is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence between range convergence and mass convergence:
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and (V, |·|V )
be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. If the norm |·|V is strictly convex
and if (µn )n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures from X to V that
converges widely to some vector measure µ, then
lim rg µn (X) = rg µ (X)

n→∞

if and only if
lim |µn |V (X) = |µ|V (X).

n→∞

The above result completely characterizes the strict convergence in terms
of range convergence. In comparison to mass convergence, the definition
of the rank depends on V only as a topological vector space, and does not
require any specific choice of norm.
The proof of Theorem 1.3 follows a more general approach due to Reshetnyak [16], relying on layerwise decomposition technique.
Theorem 1.3 shows that mass convergence implies range convergence in a
strictly convex setting. It is also known [18] that equality of the range implies
equality of the variation. This leads to the question whether the mass of a
measure depends monotonically on its range, that is, whether the inclusion
of sets rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) does imply the inequality |ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).
In the case where the norm |·|V is Euclidean, we prove such a relation:
Theorem 1.4. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped
with a semi-norm |·|V . If either dim V ≤ 2 or |·|V is Euclidean, then if Σ is
a σ–algebra on X and the vector measures ν, µ : Σ → V satisfy
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) ,
then
|ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).
If moreover the norm |·|V is strictly convex, equality in the above conclusion
occurs if and only if the ranges are equal.
In higher dimensions, we do not know if such relation still holds.
Open problem 1. If dim V ≥ 3 and if V is endowed with an arbitrary (respectively strictly) convex norm, is the mass (respectively strictly) monotone
with respect to range inclusion?

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Our approach to prove Theorem 1.4 when V is a Euclidean space directly
derives from the a representation formula
ˆ
(1.2)
|v|V = |hη, vi| dσ(η)
S

for some suitable multiple of the uniform measure σ on the unit sphere S of
V ⋆ . We will prove that (1.2) implies the representation formula
Theorem 1.5. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped
with a Euclidean norm |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector
measure µ : Σ → V and every A ∈ Σ,
ˆ
|hη, vi|(A) dσ(η).
|µ|V (A) =
S

The representation formula (1.2) means that the norm is an L1 -norm in
the sense of Choquet [4, Paragraph 41], and that the unit ball of the dual
norm is a zonoid [2, Theorem 2.1; 4]. In the two-dimensional case, any
centrally symmetric convex set is a zonoid [2, Theorem 5.4; 4] and, in fact,
any norm has a similar representation for some positive even measure σ this
implies a counterpart of Theorem 1.5 for any two-dimensional norm. The
latter characterization of zonoids fails in higher dimensions: for example
the ℓ∞ norm whose whose dual ℓ1 ball is hyperoctahedron, which is not a
zonoid.
In dimension 2, one has similar representation for any choice of norm,
and strict convexity translates by density of the support for the representing
measure σ.
When the vector space V is two-dimensional, we improve the geometric
interplay between range convergence and mass convergence, by drawing the
following link:
Theorem 1.6. Assume that V is a two-dimensional vector space, equipped
with a seminorm |·|V . If Σ is a σ–algebra on X and if µ : Σ → V is a vector
measure, then

|µ|V (X) = 21 PerV rg µ (X) .

Here PerV (rg µ (X)) is the perimeter of the closed convex set rg µ (X),
computed with respect to the seminorm |·|V . When the target space V
is equipped with a strictly convex norm, the perimeter becomes strictly
monotone and Theorem 1.3 may be derived from Theorem 1.6. This kind
of isoperimetric inequalities for convex sets were also investigated in [12].
Theorem 1.6 is the extension of the one-dimensional formula |µ|(X) =
diam rg µ (X) that follows from (1.1).
For the two-dimensional case, Theorem 1.3 may be derived also from the
integral representation (1.2).
2. Total variation and range
2.1. Vector measures. We assume that X is a space endowed with a σ–
algebra Σ and that the space V is a finite-dimensional vector space on the
real numbers. The space V ∗ is the algebraic dual of V and hη, vi = η(v)

on the vector v ∈ V .
A vector measure µ : Σ → V is a countably additive function; when
V = R it is a (finite) signed measure. A vector measure µ induces definitions

and the usual additivity, linearity and dominated convergence properties.
2.2. Total variation. The total variation of a vector measure is defined as
follows (see [1, Definition 1.4 (b)]).
Definition 2.1. Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X. The total variation of a vector
measure µ : Σ → X with respect to a seminorm |·|V is the function |µ|V :
Σ → [0, +∞] defined for each set A ∈ Σ by
|µ|V (A)(

.

The total variation enjoys properties that make of it a finite measure
[1, Theorem 1.6].
Proposition 2.2 (Finiteness). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let µ : Σ → V
be a vector measure. For every A ∈ Σ, |µ|V (A) < +∞.
Proposition 2.3 (Monotonicity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let µ : Σ → V
be a vector measure and let A, B ∈ Σ. If A ⊆ B, then
|µ|V (A) ⊆ |µ|V (B).
Proposition 2.4 (Countable additivity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and
let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure. For every sequence (An )n∈N of disjoint
sets in Σ,

|µ|V n∈N An =

We also have some algebraic properties:

Proposition 2.5 (Triangle inequality). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let
µ, ν : Σ → V be vector measures. For every A ∈ Σ,
|µ + ν|V (A) ≤ |µ|V (A) + |µ|V (A).
Proposition 2.6 (Homogeneity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let µ :
Σ → V be a vector measure. For every λ ∈ R and every A ∈ Σ,
|λµ|V (A) = |λ| |µ|V (A).

It follows from the previous properties that if the function f : X → R is

If X is a locally compact separable metric space, we endow it with its Borel
σ-algebra B(X). This topological setting on X is common when thinking
of C0 (X)⋆ as the space of finite measures on X, every finite measure being
Radon measures because X is second-countable and metric. In particular,
whatever the choice of the norm |·|V on V , the variation measure |µ|V is a
Radon measure.
Proposition 2.7. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space. If
µ : B(A) → V is a vector measure and if A ⊂ X is open, then

where V ∗ is the algebraic dual space of the vector space V and


|η|V ′ , sup hη, vi : v ∈ V and |v|V ≤ 1 .


(2.1)

Equivalently, η ∈ V ′ if and only if for every v ∈ V , |v|V = 0 implies
hη, vi = 0. By the Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms (see for example [3, Theorem 1.1]), one has
|v|V = sup hη, vi : η ∈ V ′ and |v| ≤ 1 .


(2.2)

Since V and V ′ are finite-dimensional, the suprema in (2.1) and (2.2) are
achieved in view of the Weierstrass extreme value theorem.
The proof of Proposition 2.7 is a transposition of the proof when V is
Euclidean and X is separable [1, Proposition 1.47].
Proof of Proposition 2.7. Let E1 , . . . , Em ∈ B(X) be disjoint subsets of A
and, in view of (2.2), let η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ V ′ be linear forms such that for
every i ∈ {1, . . . , m} |ηi |V ′ = 1 and hηi , µ(Ei )i = |µ(Ei )|V . Since µ is
a vector measure, |µ|V is a finite measure (Propositions 2.2 and 2.4) and
thus by Lusin’s theoremPthere exists a function ψ ∈ C(A, V ′ ) such that
|µ|V ({x ∈ A : ψ(x) 6= m
n=1 ηn χEn (x)}) < ε. Without loss of generality
we can assume that |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1. Since the set A is σ–compact and in view
Urysohn’s lemma for locally compact spaces [19, lemma 2.12], there exists
a sequence of functions (θj )j∈N in Cc (A, [0, 1]) that converges everywhere to
1 in the set A. Therefore, by multiplying ψ by θj for j ∈ N large enough,
we can assume that ψ ∈ Cc (A, V ′ ) and |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 everywhere in A. We then
have

Conversely, if ψ ∈ Cc (A, V ′ ) and |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 on A, then there exist an
integer m ∈ N, forms η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ V ′ and pairwise disjoint sets E1 , . . . , Em ∈
B(A) such P
that for each n ∈ {1, . . . , m}, |ηn |V ′ ≤ 1 and En ⊆ A and such
that if g = m

From now on, even if not stated explicitly, X will be assumed to be a
locally compact separable metric space endowed with its Borel σ-algebra
Σ = B(X).
2.3. Range. The range of a measure has a definition that has some analogies with the total variation.
Definition 2.8. The range of the vector measure µ : Σ → V on a set A ∈ Σ
is the set
rg µ (A) , conv µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂ A ⊆ V.


Here, conv H denotes the closed convex hull of a set H ⊂ V . The range
defined by Definition 2.8 only depends on the structure of V as a topological
vector space.
P
If µ = ki=1 vi δxi , with x1 , . . . , xk ∈ X distinct points, then Definition 2.8
gives for every A ∈ Σ
rg µ (A) =

( d

ti vi : 0 ≤ ti ≤ χA (xi ) .

If X ⊂ RN is a Borel-measurable set and if µ , wLN , where w : X → V is
a Borel-measurable function, then
(ˆ
f w dLN : f : X → R is Borel measurable
rg µ (A) =
)
X

and 0 ≤ f ≤ χA in X .

It follows immediately from the Definition 2.8 that the set rg µ (A) is
a closed convex subset of the space V and that 0 ∈ rg µ (A). Moreover,
rg µ (A) = {0} if and only if µ = 0.
Since for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A, µ(A \ E) = µ(A) − µ(E), we
have rg µ (A) = µ(A) − rg µ (A), that is, the set rg µ (A) is symmetric with
respect to the vector µ(A)/2 ∈ V .
In a finite-dimensional space V , the range is always bounded (see Proposition 2.2).
Proposition 2.9. Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X. If µ : Σ → V is a vector
measure, then for every A ∈ Σ, the set rg µ (A) is bounded.
This property fails in general if the domain is not a σ-algebra [8, Example 8, Proposition 11].

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Proof of Proposition 2.9. Since V is finite-dimensional, there exist vectors
v1 , . . . , vd ∈ V and linear forms η1 , . . . , ηd ∈ V ′ such that d = dim V and for
every i, j ∈ {1, . . . , d}, hηi , vj i = δij , where δij denotes Kronecker’s delta.
P
In particular, we have for every v ∈ V , v = di=1 vi hηi , vi, and thus, for
P
every set E ∈ Σ, µ(E) = di=1 vi µi (E), where µi (E) = hηi , µ(E)i. For every
i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, the set function µi is a finite signed measure and thus by the
−
Hahn–Jordan decomposition theorem it can be decomposed as µi = µ+
i +µi ,
−
where µ+
i ≥ 0, µi ≤ 0 are finite Borel measures [5, Appendix C]. Hence

and thus the set rg µ (A) is bounded.

The range is monotone with respect to the set, as was the total variation
(Proposition 2.3).
Proposition 2.10 (Monotonicity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let µ : Σ →
V be a vector measure and let A, B ∈ Σ. If A ⊆ B, then
rg µ (A) ⊆ rg µ (B) .


Proof. This follows directly from Definition 2.8.

Finally the range has a countable additivity property as the total variation
(Proposition 2.4).
Proposition 2.11 (Countable additivity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let
µ : Σ → V be a vector measure and let (An )n∈N be a sequence of disjoint
sets in Σ. Then
P
S
rg µ ( n∈N An ) = n∈N rg µ (An ).
Here n∈N rg µ (An ) denotes the set of finite sums of elements in the sets
rg µ (An ).
Since the range is compact (Proposition 2.9), Proposition 2.11 implies
that if A1 , . . . , Ak ∈ Σ are disjoint, we have

Proof of Proposition 2.11. We first assume that v ∈ n∈N rg µ (An ). Then
there exists k ∈ N and v0 , . . . , vk such that for each n ∈ {0, . . . , k}, vn ∈

rg µ (An ) and v =

{0, . . . , k}, vn = limℓ→∞ vnℓ , where
vnℓ ∈ conv µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂ An ⊆ V.

and, P
by closedness of the range,

then follows that rg µ ( n∈N An ) ⊆ n∈N rg µ (An ).


The range operation is also compatible with the linear structure of vector
measures. First it is sublinear with respect to the sum of measures, as was
the total variation Proposition 2.5.

Proposition 2.12 (Triangle inequality). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and
let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure. For every A ∈ Σ,
rg(µ + ν) (A) ⊆ rg µ (A) + rg ν (A) .
The range is not linear. Indeed, in general one has rg(µ − µ) (A) = {0} 6=
rg µ (A) + rg(−µ) (A).
Proof of Proposition 2.12. One has for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A,
µ(E) ∈ rg µ (A) + rg ν (A). Since the range is convex and bounded (Proposition 2.9), the set rg µ (A) + rg ν (A) is closed and convex and the conclusion
follows.

The range operation is also stable under linear mappings in the target.
Proposition 2.13 (Linearity of the range). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let
V, W be finite-dimensional spaces and let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure.
For every T ∈ Lin(V, W ),


rg(T ◦ µ) (X) = T rg µ (X) .
In particular, if λ ∈ R and A ∈ Σ, we have
(2.3)

rg(λ µ) (A) = λ rg µ (A) ,

which is the counterpart of Proposition 2.6.
Proof of Proposition 2.13. If E ∈ Σ and if E ⊆ A, then we have (T ◦µ)(E) =
T (µ(E)). It follows then that
conv ({T ◦ µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})
= T (conv ({µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})
We observe now that if the set H ⊂ V is convex and bounded, then by continuity and compactness in the finite-dimensional space V , T (H) = T (H). 
The topological structure on the space X can be used to characterize the
range by duality on test functions.
Proposition 2.14. If X is a locally compact separable metric space and if
µ : B(X) → V is a vector Borel measure and if the set A ⊂ X is open, then

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Proof of Proposition 2.14. Let E ∈ B(X). Since µ is a vector measure,
|µ|V (X) is a finite measure (Propositions 2.2 and 2.4) and thus by Lusin’s
theorem there exists a function ϕ ∈ C(X) such that |µ|V ({x ∈ X : ϕ(x) 6=
χE (x)}) ≤ ε). Since the set A is open and σ–compact, we can assume
without loss of generality that ϕ ∈ Cc (A, [0, 1]). We then have
ˆ
ϕ dµ ≤ ε|µ|V (A).
µ(E) −

This implies thus that


µ(E) ∈ hµ, ϕi : ϕ ∈ Cc (X, [0, 1]) .
Conversely, if ϕ ∈ Cc (A), there exists a Borel-measurable function f :
A → [0, 1] that takes only finitely may values and such that |f − ϕ| ≤ ε on
A. We then have

2.4. Links between the range and the total variation. In the onedimensional case, there is a straightforward relationship between the range
and the mass.
Proposition 2.15. Assume that dim(V ) = 1. If µ : Σ → V is a vector
measure and A ∈ Σ, then
|µ|V (A) = diam(rg µ (A)).
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that V = R. Let µ =
µ+ + µ− be the Hahn–Jordan decomposition (see e.g. [5, Appendix C]) into
measures µ+ ≥ 0 and µ− ≤ 0. One has then
|µ|(A) = µ+ (A) − µ− (A)
and
rg µ (A) = [µ− (A), µ+ (A)],
and the conclusion follows.



In higher dimensions, the mass and the range are still related by a quantitative bound.
Proposition 2.16 (Comparison between total variation and range). Let
(V, |·|V ) be a seminormed space. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for
every Σ–algebra on the space X and every vector measure µ : Σ → V and
every A ∈ Σ, we have
rg µ (A) ⊂ BV (0, |µ|V (A))
and


|µ|V (A) ≤ C sup |v|V : v ∈ rg µ (A) .

Diestel and Uhl have a similar statement for the semivariation of a vector
measure in a Banach space [8, Proposition I.1.11].
Proof of Proposition 2.16. For the first part of the proposition, by Definition 2.1, for every set E ∈ Σ such that E ⊆ A we have
|µ(E)|V ≤ |µ(E)|V + |µ(A \ E)|V ≤ |µ|V (A),
and the assertion follows from Definition 2.8.
For the second part, let η1 , . . . , ηd be a basis of V ′ . By (2.2), there exists
a constant C1 > 0 such that for every v ∈ V ,
|v|V ≤ C1

|hηi , vi|.

It follows then that if the sets E1 , . . . , Eℓ ∈ Σ are pairwise disjoint and if

Proposition 2.16 implies the continuity of the range with respect to the
seminorm induced by the total variation.
Proposition 2.17. If µ, ν : Σ → V and A ∈ Σ, then
dH (rg ν (A) , rg µ (A)) ≤ |ν − µ|V (A).
Here dH (rg ν (A) , rg µ (A)) denotes the Hausdorff distance between nonempty compact subsets of V : if K1 , K2 ⊂ V are non-empty compact sets,
dH (K1 , K2 ) , inf ε > 0 : K1 ⊆ K2 + B(0, ε) and K2 ⊆ K1 + B(0, ε) .


Proposition 2.17 implies in particular that if the sequence (µn )n∈N converges in total variation to µ on A, then the sequence of sets (rg µn (A))n∈N
converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance.
Proof of Proposition 2.17. By the triangle inequality for the range (Proposition 2.12), we have
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg(ν − µ) (X) + rg µ (X) .
By Proposition 2.16, we have
rg(ν − µ) (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ).
We conclude then that
rg ν (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ) + rg µ (X) .
By symmetry, we also have
rg µ (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ) + rg ν (X) ,
and the conclusion follows from the definition of Hausdorff distance.

A second property is the fact that the range determines univocally the
image: if two measures share the same range on a set A, then their total
variation on that set coincides [18].
Proposition 2.18 (Rodríguez-Piazza). Let µ, ν : Σ → V be vector measures. If rg µ (X) = rg ν (X), then |µ|V (X) = |ν|V (X).
The next lemma highlights the key property used by Rodríguez-Piazza
to prove Proposition 2.18. It is an adaptation, in terms of total masses,
of a representation principle for the norm by finite combination of positive
values of linear functionals [18, Lemma 2].
Lemma 2.19. Let |·|V be a seminorm on V . For each ε > 0, there exists
η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ V ′ and α1 , . . . , αm ∈ {−1, 1} such that, for every Σ–algebra on
the space X and every vector measure µ : Σ → V , we have
|µ|V (A) −

Rodríguez-Piazza’s Proposition 2.18 can be deduced immediately from
Lemma 2.19.
Proof of Proposition 2.18. Let ε > 0 and let then η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ V ′ and
α1 , . . . , αm ∈ {−1, 1} be given by Lemma 2.19. Since rg µ (A) = rg ν (A),
we have for every i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, in view of Proposition 2.15,
|hηi , µi|(A) = diam(rghηi , µi (A)) = diam(rghηi , νi (A)) = |hηi , νi|(A),
and therefore by Lemma 2.19,


|ν|V (A) − |µ|V (A) ≤ ε |ν|V (A) + |µ|V (A) ;
since ε > 0 is arbitrary, the conclusion follows.



2.5. Wide convergence. The notion of wide convergence of measures is
classically defined by testing the measure against compactly supported functions.
Definition 2.20. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space. A
sequence of vector measures (µn )n∈N from X to V converges widely to some
vector measure µ whenever for every ϕ ∈ Cc (X),
ˆ
ˆ
ϕ dµ.
ϕ dµn =
lim
n→∞ X

X

The wide convergence is compatible with the linear structure of V . If
T ∈ Lin(V, W ) and if the sequence (µn )n∈N converges widely to µ, then
(T ◦ µn )n∈N converges widely to T ◦ µ.
A classical result is the lower semicontinuity of the mass under weak
convergence.
Proposition 2.21. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and let
(V, |·|V ) be a seminormed finite-dimensional space. If (µn )n∈N is a sequence
of vector measures from X to V widely converging to some vector measure
µ : B(X) → V , then
|µ|V (X) ≤ lim inf |µn |V (X).

n→∞
′
Proof. Let ψ ∈ Cc (X, V ) and assume that |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 everywhere in X.

Proposition 2.7 for every n ∈ N,

hψ, dµn i ≤ |µn |V ,

and thus, in view of Definition 2.20
ˆ
ˆ
hψ, dµn i ≤ lim inf |µn |V .
hψ, dµn i = lim
n→∞ X

X

n→∞

We conclude by Proposition 2.7.



In order to have an analogue for the range, we define the Kuratoswki
lower limit of a sequence of set.
Definition 2.22. The Kuratowski lower limit of a sequence (Cn )n∈N of subsets of V is defined as
lim inf Cn ,
n→∞

n

lim xn : the sequence (xn )n∈N converges in V
o
and for every n ∈ N, xn ∈ Cn .

n→∞

14

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

By a diagonal argument, the Kuratowski lower limit lim inf n→∞ Cn is
always a closed set. Moreover, if Cn is convex for every n ∈ N, then the
Kuratowski lower limit lim inf n→∞ Cn is convex. Similarly, if for every n ∈
N, 0 ∈ Cn , then 0 ∈ lim inf n→∞ Cn .
Proposition 2.23 (Weak lower-semi continuity of the range). If (µn )n∈N
is a sequence of vector measures from X to V that converges widely to some
vector measure µ : B(X) → V , then
rg µ (X) ⊆ lim inf rg µn (X) .
n→∞

Moreover, for every ε > 0, if n ∈ N is large enough
rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε).
In general, the inclusion is strict. Indeed if the space X is not discrete
and V 6= {0}, there exists a point x ∈ X and a sequence (xn )n∈N in X \ {x}
converging to x. If v ∈ V \ {0}, the sequence (vδx − vδxn )n∈N converges
widely to 0, but the range of any of its terms is [−v, v] while the range of
the limit is 0, so that the inclusion is strict.
Proof of Proposition 2.23. For every ϕ ∈ Cc (X, [0, 1]), we observe that for
every n ∈ N, in view of Proposition 2.14
ˆ
ϕ dµn ∈ rg µn (X)
lim
n→∞ X

Hence in view of Definitions 2.20 and 2.22, we have
ˆ
ˆ
ϕ dµn ∈ lim inf rg µn (X) .
ϕ dµ = lim
X

n→∞ X

n→∞

Since the Kuratowski lower limit lim inf n→∞ rg µn (X) is closed and convex,
the conclusion follows from Proposition 2.14.
For the additional assertion, let ε > 0. Since the set rg µ (X) is compact,
there exists a finite set F ⊆ rg µ (X) such that
(2.4)

rg µ (X) ⊆ F + B(0, ε/2).

Since the set F is finite, by the first part of the proof, when n ∈ N is large
enough
(2.5)

F ⊂ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε/2)

and thus by (2.4) and (2.5) we have
(2.6)

rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε).

3. Convergence of the total variation and of the range
We consider in this section the relationship, for widely converging sequences between convergence of the range and convergence of the total variation.

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

3.1. Range convergence implies mass convergence. If a sequence of
vector measures converges widely and if its ranges converge, then its total
variations converge.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We fix ε ∈ (0, 1) and we let η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ V ′ and
α1 , . . . , αm ∈ R be given by Lemma 2.19, so that
(1−ε)|µn |V (X) ≤ (1+ε)|µ|V (X)+

m
X

αi |hηi , µi|V (X) − αi |hηi , µn i|V (X) .

i=1

We observe that for every n ∈ N and every i ∈ {1, . . . , m},
diam(hηi , rg µn (X)i) − diam(hηi , rg µn (X)i)
≤ 2 |ηi |V ′ dH (rg µn (X) , rg µ (X)).
By Proposition 2.21 and by Proposition 2.15, we have, as n → ∞,
|hηi , µn i|V (X) = diam(hηi , rg µn (X)i)
→ diam(hηi , rg µ (X)i) = |hηi , µi|V (X).
If ε < 1, it follows that
lim sup |µn |V (X) ≤
n→∞

1+ε
|µ|V (X).
1−ε


The conclusion follows by letting ε → 0.

3.2. One-dimensional case. When dim V = 1, the convergence of the
range is equivalent to the convergence of the total variation.
Proposition 3.1. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and
let V be a one-dimensional space. Let (µn )n∈N be sequence from X to V
converging widely to some vector measure µ. If
lim sup |µn |(X) ≤ |µ|(X),
n→∞



then the sequence rg µn (X) n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance.
Proof. Let ε > 0. By Proposition 2.23, if n ∈ N is large enough, we have
rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε).

(3.1)
It follows then that
(3.2)

rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X)
 

+ B 0, ε + diam(rg µn (X)) − diam(rg µ (X)) + .
The conclusion follows from (3.1) and (3.2) since ε > 0 is arbitrary.



A corollary of the one dimensional case described above in Proposition 3.1
is the following equivalence criterion for range convergence, in terms of
masses of projection measures:

16

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

Corollary 3.2. Let (µn )n∈N be a sequence of vector measures. The sequence
(rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance if, and only if,
for every η ∈ V ′ ,
lim sup |hη, µn i|(X) ≤ |hη, µi|(X).
n→∞

Proof. Let ε > 0. For every η ∈ V ′ , the sequence (hη, µn i)n∈N of signed
measures converges widely to the signed measure hη, µi. By Proposition 3.1,
we have then


lim dH rghηi , µn i (X) , rghηi , µi (X) = 0.

(3.3)

n→∞

Since the set rg µ (X) ⊂ V is compact and convex, there exist η1 , . . . , ηm ∈
V ′ and δ > 0 such that


(3.4)

rg µ (X) ⊆ v ∈ V : for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, hηi , vi ≤ 1

and
(3.5)



v ∈ V : for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m} hηi , vi ≤ 1 + δ
⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, δ).

In particular, if n ∈ N is large enough, we have by Proposition 2.13 and by
(3.3) and (3.4),
sup hηi , rg µn (X)i = sup rg hηi , µn i (X) ≤ 1 + δ,
and thus by (3.5)
(3.6)

rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).

We conclude the first implication by combining the inclusion (3.6) with
Proposition 2.23. The converse claim of the proposition follows from the
fact that range convergence always implies mass convergence, and
|hη, rg µ (X)i| = |µ|Ṽ ,
where Ṽ is the vector space V endowed with the degenerate norm
|x|Ṽ = | (x, η) |.



3.3. Higher-dimensional case. In this section, we prove an equivalence
result between convergence of the range and convergence of the total mass,
when the mass is taken with respect to any strictly convex norm.
A seminorm |·|V is strictly convex whenever if the vectors v, w ∈ V are
linearly independent, then
|v + w|V < |v|V + |w|V .
As claimed in Proposition 1.2 stated in the introduction, strict convexity of the norm is necessary to enforce the convergence of ranges. The
proof of Proposition 1.2 we propose is based on an straightforward counterexample involving Dirac masses:
Proof of Proposition 1.2. Since by our assumption the seminorm |·|V is not
strictly convex, there exist two linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V \ {0}
such that |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V . Since the space X is not discrete, there

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

17

exists a point x ∈ X and a sequence of points (xn )n∈N in X \ {x} that
converges to x. We define for each n ∈ N, the vector measure
µn , v δx + w δxn .
The sequence (µn )n∈N then widely converges to the measure µ = (v + w) δx
and we have for each n ∈ N
|µ|V (X) = |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V = |µn |V (X).
On the other hand the range of rg µn (X) = conv {0, v, w, v + w} while
rg µ (X) = conv {0, v + w} corresponds to the diagonal of the parallelogram
rg((X) µn ). Since the vectors v and w are linearly independent, the sequence
of ranges does not converge.

In particular, by Proposition 1.2 and Proposition 3.1 there exists a linear
map T : V → R such that the sequence (|T ◦ µn |(Ω))n∈N does not converge
to |T ◦ µ|(Ω). That is, in contrast with wide convergence and with convergence of ranges, the convergence of total variations is not invariant under
linear changes of variables.
Theorem 3.3. Assume that X is a locally compact separable metric space,
and let (µn )n∈N be a sequence of vector measures weakly converging to some
vector measure µ. If |·|V is a strictly convex norm on V such that
lim |µn |V (X) = |µ|V (X),

n→∞

then the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance.
The proof follows lines of thought from the work of Reshetnyak [16, Theorem 3], Since the approach requires some tools from measure theory, we
repeat the proof with explanations on how the tools are used, and we chain
the argument with Corollary 3.2 to obtain Hausdorff convergence of the
ranges.
Proof of Theorem 3.3. For all n ∈ N, let χµn be the indicator measure [16]
of |µ|V , defined as the unique measure
χµ : B(X × S) → [0, +∞)
acting on any continuous function ϕ ∈ C(X × S, R) as



ϕ x,
ϕ(x, e) dχµ (x, e) =

X×S
Since we are working with vector measures, and because the ranges and
the masses remain uniformly bounded for n ∈ N, we may pass to subsequences and assume without loss of generality that the sequence (χµn )n∈N
weakly converges to some measure ρ. As in [16, Theorem 3], we are going to
prove that the limit ρ actually equals χµ , the indicator function of |µ|V . To
that purpose, we use [16, Theorem 1] to obtain a layerwise decomposition
(ω, λ) of the indicator measure ρ [16], in the
 sense that ω : X → [0, +∞) is
a positive measure and λ : X → M B(S) is a function such that for every
ϕ ∈ C(X × S),
ˆ ˆ
ˆ
ϕ(x, e) dλ(x, e) dω(x).
ϕ(x, e) dρ(v, e) =

Moreover, for this layerwise decomposition, the function

The existence of such decomposition with relation (3.7) only uses the weak

|u(x)|V ≤
S

Those inequality follow from [16, Theorem 1], where it is proved that λ(x, S) =

with respect to the measure ω also yields
ˆ
ˆ ˆ

dρ(x, e),

The strict convexity of the norm |·|V may be used to observe that in fact,
λ(x, ·) is a Dirac mass at u(x), for |µ|V -almost-all x ∈ X. Indeed, this
follows from the fact that

which is possible if and only if λ(x, ·) is a multiple of a Dirac mass. The

Since this holds for all η ∈ S, we obtain Hausdorff convergence of the range,
by Corollary 3.2.

Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 3.3 imply immediately Theorem 1.3.
4. Zonal representation of masses
In this section, we develop a geometric approach to manage the relation
between range convergence and mass convergence. Although the geometric
approach will give much less results when dim(V ) ≥ 3, it provides an interesting geometric point of view of the relation between mass convergence
and strict convergence when dim(V ) = 2.
4.1. Zonal representation formula. We will show that seminorms having a zonal representation have an associated mass that has an integral
representation.
Definition 4.1. A locally finite non-negative Borel measure σ : B(V ′ ) →
[0, +∞] is a zonal representation of a seminorm |·|V whenever
ˆ
|η|V ′ dσ(η) < +∞,
V′

and for every v ∈ V ,
|v|V =

|hη, vi| dσ(η).

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

As an example, we can consider the standard Euclidean norm in R2 and
the uniform measure ν on the unit circle S ⊂ R2 , giving
ˆ
ˆ
|v|2 2π
2
|hv, ei| dρ(e) =
| cos(θ)| dθ = |v|2 ,
2π 0
π
S
and the zonal representation holds with σ = π2 ρ.
More generally, every Euclidean norm admits a zonal representation.
Theorem 4.2 (Representation of Euclidean norms). If |·|V is a Euclidean
semi-norm on V , then it admits a zonal representation.
Proof. Up to a linear isometry and an orthogonal projection, we can assume
that V = Rd and |·|V = |·|2 is the standard Euclidean norm. Then we have
ˆ
|v|2 = α |hv, ei| dσ(e),
S

where σ is the uniform surface measure on the Euclidean sphere S, and
α = α(d) > 0 is a normalization constant. The above identity directly
follows from the fact that the uniform surface measure is the unique (up to
multiplication constants) Borel measure on S that is stable under isometries
of Rd .

A norm |·|V has a zonal representation if and only if the associated unit
ball in V ⋆ is a zonoid, which can be defined as the ranges of vector measure
[2, Theorem 2.1; 4].
If V is a two-dimensional space, every norm has a zonal representation
in the sense of Definition 4.1 ([2, Theorem 5.4; 4, 41.2]). This follows from
the fact that, in the plane R2 , every symmetric compact convex set may
be approximated by a symmetric convex polygon with is automatically a
zonotope in R2 .
For example, the usual Euclidean norm is represented by the uniform
measure on the dual sphere S of V ′ since the uniform measure is the only
(up to multiplicative constants) invariant measure under rotations and thus,
balls induced by its associated norm are Euclidean balls. This argument is
also valid in higher dimensions.
Another example is given by the ℓ1 -norm on Rd defined for v ∈ Rd by
|v|∞ ,

d
X

|v1 |,

i=1

which can be represented with σ =

Pd

i=1 δηi , where ηi (v1 , . . . , vd ) = vi .

In higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3, there are some norms that do not have
a zonal representation. If v = (v1 , . . . , vd ) ∈ Rd , then
|v|∞ = max{|v1 |, . . . , |vd |}.
has no zonal representation of the form Definition 4.1 by any positive measure σ. Indeed, if such measure σ existed, then its dual ball, which is the
ℓ1 –ball, should be a zonotope. However, the 1–ball is a hyperoctahedron,
which has some 2–dimensional that are triangles, and is thus not a zonotope
[2, Theorem 3.3].

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

21

The above example is not related with the fact that the ℓ1 and ℓ∞ norms
are not strictly convex. In fact, there are also strictly convex norms that
are do not have a zonal representation Definition 4.1. Indeed, in R3 , the
log 3
p–norm does not have a zonal representation, if p ≥ log
3 , and for every
2

p > 2 it is known that the p–norm does not have a zonal representation is
the dimension is large enough [2, (32); 23, Proposition 2].
Remark 4.3. If σ ′ : B(V ′ ) → [0, +∞) is a measure such that for every Borel
cone C ∈ B(V ′ ), σ ′ (C) = σ(C), then for every v ∈ V ,

In particular, the measure σ satisfying the assumption of Lemma 4.4 is not
unique; a canonical representative can be given by requiring sigma to be an
even measure supported on the unit sphere of V ′ .
The existence of zonal representation of the norm in V automatically
implies a similar representation formula for the mass. It may be seen as
an alternative way of representing the mass, without relying on layerwise
decompositions.
Lemma 4.4 (Representation of the mass). If σ : B(V ′ ) → R+ is a zonal
representation of |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector measure
µ : Σ → V and every A ∈ Σ,
ˆ
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η).
|µ|V (A) =

Proof. If E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Σ are disjoints subsets of A, we have

and thus by the definition of total variation of a vector measure (Definition 2.1)

|µ|V (A) ≤

Conversely, in view of Remark 4.3 we can assume that the measure σ is
supported in a compact set K ⊂ V ′ \{0}. In particular σ is a finite measure.
Let ε > 0, there exists η1 , . . . , ηm ∈ K such that

In particular, if η ∈ BV ′ (ηi , ε) and E ∈ Σ, we have

|hη, µi|(E) − |hηi , µi|(E) ≤ ε|µ|V (E).

4.2. Application to monotonicity and convergence. When V is equipped
with an Euclidean norm the monotony of the mass with respect to range
inclusion, Theorem 1.4 stated in the introduction, is a direct consequence of
the zonal representation, Lemma 4.4.
Because of the particular structure of two-dimensional vector spaces, the
proof we give also holds for any norm on V whenever dim V = 2.
Proof of Theorem 1.4. Given two vector measures µ, ν such that
rg µ (X) ⊆ rg ν (X) ,
we clear have, for all η ∈ S:
hη, rg µ (X)i ⊆ hη, rg ν (X)i.
Since the range commutes with linear maps, we directly obtain, for all η ∈ S:
rghη, µi (X) ⊆ rghη, νi (X) .
Since the measures hη, µi and hη, νi are real-valued, we obtain
|hη, µi| ≤ |hη, νi|,

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

23

for all η ∈ S. Since V is Euclidean or dim V = 2, this implies, by Lemma 4.4,
|µ|V (X) ≤ |ν|V (X). If the norm is strictly convex, then the inequality is
strict.

Relying on the integral and perimeter formulae obtained above, we also
propose an alternative proof of Theorem 1.3.
We first draw a link between the support of a zonal representation and
strict convexity. The above characterization will turn out to be particularly
efficient in dimension 2.
Definition 4.5. A zonal representation σ : B(V ′ ) → [0, +∞] of a seminorm
|·|V is non-degenerate whenever for every non-empty double cone C ⊂ V ,
σ(C) > 0.
We recall that the set C ⊂ V ′ is an open cone whenever for every λ ∈
R \ {0} and x ∈, λC = C.
In dimension 2, the non-degeneracy of the zonal representation is equivalent to strict convexity. This will turn out to be false in higher dimensions.
Proposition 4.6. Let V be a finite-dimensional space. Assume that σ is a
zonal representation of the seminorm |·|V . The norm |·|V is strictly convex
if and only if for every linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V , there exists
η ∈ supp(σ) such that hη, vi and hη, wi do not have the same sign.
In particular, if V is a 2-dimensional vector space, then the norm is strictly
convex if, and only if, σ is non-degenerate.
Proof of Proposition 4.6. We observe that for every η ∈ V ′ and v ∈ V , we
have
hη, vi + hη, wi ≥ hη, vi + hη, wi ,
with equality if and only if the numbers hη, vi and hη, wi have the same sign.
We have
ˆ
hη, vi + hη, wi dσ(η)
|v + w|V =

ˆ
ˆV
hη, wi dσ(η) = |v|V + |w|V ,
hη, vi dσ(η) +
≥
V′

V′

with equality if and only if hη, vi and hη, wi have the same sign for every
η ∈ supp σ, since the map z ∈ V ′ 7→ hη, zi is continuous.
In particular, if σ is a non-degenerate zonal representation, then the norm
|·|V is strictly convex. In the two-dimensional case dim V = 2, the separation condition of Proposition 4.6 on the support conversely implies the
density condition on the support. Indeed, for every η ∈ V ′ and every δ > 0,
there exists v, w ∈ V such that if η ′ ∈ V ′ and hη ′ , vi ≤ 0 ≤ hη ′ , wi, then

|η − η ′ |V ′ ≤ δ.
Density of the support for a zonal representation of a strictly convex norm
in higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3 fails in general. As an example, one can
consider V = R3 and the measure σ = σx,y + σx,z + σz,y , where σx,y is the
uniform measure on the circle orthogonal to the y-axis; and similarly for
σx,z and σz,y . Then the support supp(σ) is far from being dense in S, but

We know give another proof of Theorem 1.3 by mean of zonal integral
representation. We restrict ourselves to the case of Euclidean norms in the
case dim V ≥ 3, and strictly convex norms in the case dim V = 2.
Second proof of Theorem 1.3, by zonal representation. We shall only need
to prove that mass convergence implies convergence of the range, as the
converse statement holds in all generality.
For every η ∈ V ′ , the sequence (hη, µn i)n∈N converges widely to (hη, µi)
and by Proposition 2.21, we have
(4.6)

lim inf |hη, µn i|(X) ≥ |hη, µi|(X).
n→∞

Since |·|V is a Euclidean norm, there exists a constant κ > 0 such that for
every v ∈ V ,
ˆ
(4.7)
|v|V = κ |hη, vi| dη

where S is the unit sphere in V ≃ V . By Lemma 4.4 and by our assumption,

|hη2 , µn i|(X) − |hη1 , µn i|(X) ≤ |η2 − η1 |V ′ |µn |V (X).

By (4.6), (4.8) and (4.9), we deduce that for every η ∈ SV ′ , we have
(4.10)

lim |hη, µn i|(X) = |hη, µi|(X).

n→∞

By homogeneity, this still holds for every η ∈ V ′ and the conclusion follows
then from Corollary 3.2.

5. Perimeter representation of masses
5.1. Perimeter formula. So far, we have used zonal representation of
norms in spaces of dimension 2 to approach the problem of mass convergence
from a geometric point of view. In particular, we were able to characterize
strict convexity of the norm through density of the support for the measure
representing the norm.
We now give further geometric insight of the problem, by interpreting the
total mass of a vector valued measure as the perimeter of its range (up to
some multiplicative constant).
We first define the perimeter of a polygon in a two-dimensional space.
Definition 5.1. If dim V = 2 and P ⊂ V if P is a polygon of vertices
v1 , . . . , vℓ , we define its perimeter as
PerV (P ) ,

ℓ
X
i=1

|vℓ − vℓ−1 |V ,

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

25

with the convention that v0 = vℓ .
This notion of perimeter is analogous to the notion of perimeter in crystalline variational problems [9, 11, 22, 24].
The perimeter of convex polygons is monotone with respect to set inclusion.
Lemma 5.2. If dim V = 2 and P1 ⊆ P2 ⊂ V are convex polygons, then
PerV (P1 ) ≤ PerV (P2 ).
Proof. Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that P1 ⊂ H and ∂H contains one
side of ∂P1 . Then by the triangle inequality for the seminorm PerV (H∩P2 ) ≤
PerV (H). By repeating this process on each edge of the polygon P1 , we reach
the conclusion.

Lemma 5.2 suggests to extend the definition of perimeter to convex sets
as the least upper bound of the perimeter of polygonal subsets.
Definition 5.3. If C ⊂ V is convex, we set
o

PerV (C) , sup PerV (P ) : P ⊆ C is a convex polygon .


In view of Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3 coincide for polygons.
The monotonicity property of Lemma 5.2 can be transferred to arbitrary
subsets and the equality cases can be characterized for strictly convex norms.
Proposition 5.4. If C1 ⊆ C2 ⊆ V are compact convex sets, then
PerV (C1 ) ≤ PerV (C2 ),
If |·|V is a strictly convex norm and if equality holds, then C1 = C2 .
Proof. The inequality follows from Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3.
For the equality case, we assume by contradiction that C1 ( C2 There
exists v ∈ C2 \ C1 . Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that v 6∈ H and C1 ⊂ H.
In particular, for every w1 , w2 ∈ C1 , we have since |·|V is a strictly convex
norm,
|w2 − w1 |V < |w2 − v|V + |v − w1 |V .
We define
η , inf{|w2 − v|V + |v − w1 |V − |w2 − w1 |V : w1 , w2 ∈ C1 }.
Since the set C1 is compact and convex, we have η > 0. If P1 ⊆ C1 is a
polygon, then the polygon P2 defined as the convex hull of P1 and v satisfies
P2 ⊆ C2 and
PerV (P2 ) ≥ PerV (P1 ) + η.
By taking the supremum, it follows from Definition 5.3 that
PerV (C2 ) ≥ PerV (C1 ) + η > PerV (C1 ).



We establish Theorem 1.6 which states that
|µ|V (X) = 21 Per rg µ (X) .


This formula together with Lemma 4.4 yield a Cauchy–Crofton-like integral
formula for the perimeter: for any compact convex set C ⊆ V :

PerV (C) = 2 diamhη, Ci dσ(η).

JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN

The proof of Theorem 1.6 is based on the following property of polygons.
Lemma 5.5. Let V be a two-dimensional vector space and |·|V be a seminorm on V . For every m ∈ N and v1 , . . . , vm ∈ V , one has
m
X

|vn |V = 12 PerV [0, v1 ] + · · · + [0, vm ] .


n=1

Lemma 5.5 implies in particular immediately that Theorem 1.6 holds
when µ has finite support.
Proof of Lemma 5.5. We proceed by induction. The identity is trivial if
m = 0. The induction step follows from the observation that
1
2 PerV

[0, v1 ]+ · · · + [0, vm+1 ] = 12 PerV [0, v1 ]+ · · · + [0, vm ] + |vm+1 |V . 




Proof of Theorem 1.6. If E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Σ are disjoint subsets of A, then we
have
m
X

|µ(En )|V = 21 PerV [0, µ(E1 )] + · · · + [0, µ(En )] .


n=1

Since [0, µ(E1 )] + · · · + [0, µ(En )] ⊂ rg µ (A), it follows from the definition of
total variation (Definition 2.1) that
(5.2)

|µ|V (A) ≤ 12 PerV (rg µ (A)).

Conversely, if P ⊂ rg µ (A) is a polygon, there exist sets F1 , . . . , Fk ∈ Σ
such that F1 , . . . , Fk ⊆ A, µ(F1 ), . . . , µ(Fk ) are the vertices of P . Hence there
exists disjoint sets E1 , . . . , Em ∈ Σ such that P ⊆ [0, µ(E1 )]+· · ·+[0, µ(Em )].
It follows thus by Definition 5.3 that
(5.3) 12 PerV (P ) ≤ 12 PerV [0, µ(E1 )] + · · · + [0, µ(Em )] =


m

|µ(En )|V (A).

Hence by definition of total variation (Definition 2.1),
1
2 PerV (P ) ≤ |µ|V (A)

and thus by definition of perimeter (Definition 5.3)
(5.4)

1
2 PerV (rg µ (A)) ≤ |µ|V (A).

The conclusion comes from the combination of (5.2) and (5.4).



5.2. Application to monotonicity and convergence. Theorem 1.6 gives
a proof of the monotonicity of the range with respect to the mass.
Second proof of Theorem 1.4 when dim V = 2. We apply Theorem 1.6 and
Proposition 5.4.

As a final result, we give a proof of Theorem 1.3 in the two-dimensional
case, based on the perimeter formula, Theorem 1.6.
Third proof of Theorem 1.3 by mean of perimeter formula. If the set C ⊂
V is compact and convex, we define the function γC : V → [0, +∞) by
(5.5)

γC (v) , PerV conv (C + {v}) .

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES

We observe that, by the triangle inequality and the definitions, for every
v1 , v2 ∈ V ,
(5.6)

|γC (v2 ) − γC (v1 )| ≤ 2|v2 − v1 |V

and that if 0 ∈ C,
(5.7)

|v|V ≤ γC (v).

Let ε > 0. By the Weierstrass extreme value theorem and, since |·|V is a
strictly convex norm, by Proposition 5.4 we have
δ , inf{γrg µ(X) (v) : dist(v, rg µ (X)) ≥ ε} − PerV (rg µ (X)) > 0.
By (5.5) and Definition 5.3 for every v ∈ V , there exists a polygon Pv ⊂
rg µ (X) such that

γPv (v) ≥ γrg µ(X) (v) − .

and thus if γPv (v ) ≤ PerV (rg µ (X))+ 2 , then v ∈ rg µ (X)+B(0, ε). In view
of (5.7), by a compactness argument, there exists a polygon P ⊆ rg µ (X)
such that if γP (v) ≤ PerV (rg µ (X)) + 2δ , then v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε). By
Proposition 2.23 and Definition 2.22, there exists a sequence of polygons
(Pn )n∈N whose vertices converge to those of P and such that for every n ∈ N,
Pn ⊂ rg µn (X). For every v ∈ V , we have limn→∞ γPn (v) = γP (v), and
thus in view of (5.6), for n ∈ N large enough, if v ∈ V satisfies γPn (v) ≤
PerV (rg µ (X)) + 4δ , then v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).
Assume now that v ∈ rg µn (X). One has then conv Pn + {v} ⊂ rg µn (X),
and thus if n ∈ N is large enough, we have
δ
γPn (v) ≤ PerV (µn ) ≤ PerV (µ) + .
4
By construction of Pn , this implies that v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε) and thus
γPv (v ′ ) ≥ γrg µ(X) (v ′ ) −

(5.8)

rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).

The conclusion then follows from (5.8) and Proposition 2.23.
