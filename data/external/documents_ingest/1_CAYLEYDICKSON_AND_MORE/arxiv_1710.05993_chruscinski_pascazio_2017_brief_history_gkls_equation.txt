                                              We reconstruct the chain of events, intuitions and ideas that led to the formulation of the
                                           Gorini, Kossakowski, Lindblad and Sudarshan equation.


                                           1    Introduction
                                                If you take any two historical events and you ask whether there are similarities and
                                                differences, the answer is always going to be both “yes” and “no.” At some sufficiently
                                                fine level of detail there will be differences, and at some sufficiently abstract level there
                                                will be similarities. The question we want to ask in the two cases we are considering,
                                                [. . .] is whether the level at which there are similarities is, in fact, a significant one. [1]
                                           The articles written by Vittorio Gorini, Andrzej Kossakowski and George Sudarshan (GKS) [2],
                                           and Göran Lindblad [3] belong to the list of the most influential papers in theoretical physics.
                                           They were published almost at the same time: the former [2] in May 1976 and the latter [3]
                                           in June 1976. Interestingly, they were also submitted simultaneously: [2] on March 19th, 1975,
                                           and [3] on April 7th, 1975. Archive and on-line submission did not exist in the ’70s, so both
                                           papers were very probably in gestation at the same time.
                                               It is always difficult to reconstruct facts from (necessarily incomplete) data. This is the
                                           work of historians. Things are even more complicated when one has to reconstruct how ideas
                                           are born, and when and where. We decided to resort to the wisdom of Noam Chomsky [1]
                                           and analyze events, as well as detailed technical findings. However, while writing this note, we
                                           realized that one cannot just compare two articles or (worse) two equations: after all, GKS and
                                           Lindblad derived and published a very similar equation at the same time. It is more interesting
                                           to compare hypotheses and derivation, and the way the necessary concepts are formulated. Ideas
                                           are born in complicated fashions. Environments, influences, conferences, discussions, scientific
                                           literature are but a number of factors that play a crucial role.
                                               Michel Berry, in his beautiful webpage, quotes André Gide:



                                                                                               1
            Everything has been said before, but since nobody listens we have to keep going back
            and beginning all over again.1
       True. But after all this article must be kept finite, and we shall abstain from going back to
       Aristotle. The only way out of this dilemma is to try and define Chomsky’s “level of detail at
       which there are similarities” and decide whether it is a significant one. This will entail a certain
       degree of arbitrariness. We ask our readers to make allowance for our superficiality.
           Let us mention a few facts. In 1972, Andrzej Kossakowski published a largely un-noticed
       article [4] in which he proposed an axiomatic definition of dynamical semigroup. From March
       26th to April 6th, 1973, Vittorio Gorini attended the conference “Foundations of quantum
       mechanics and ordered linear spaces”, in Marburg, where he listened to talks by E. Størmer
       and K. Kraus, who both mentioned the notion of complete positivity. From September to
       December 1974 Vittorio Gorini and Andrzej Kossakowski were both visiting George Sudarshan,
       at the University of Texas at Austin.2 Göran Lindblad used to work alone. He defended his
       thesis in May 1974. In December 1974 he participated in the Symposium on Mathematical
       Physics, organized in Toruń by Roman Ingarden — Kossakowski’s PhD supervisor. He sent an
       interesting recollection letter of those times to the organizers of the 48th SMP meeting. This
       letter is reproduced in Sect. 8. In January 1975 Gorini went to visit Lindblad in Stockholm,
       on the way back from Texas. Kossakowski never met Lindblad. The two articles that concern
       us here [2, 3] were submitted between March and April 1975. In 1980 Kraus spent a sabbatical
       year at the University of Texas at Austin; besides George Sudarshan, there were John Archibald
       Wheeler, Arno Böhm and William Wootters.
           We shall consider these facts in the following. Now let us clarify what this article is not. It
       is not a review paper. It is not tutorial. It does not contain novel results. It does assume some
       familiarity with dissipative quantum systems and notation. It makes full use of our personal
       interactions with the four protagonists of this story. Figure 1 shows a 1975 picture taken in
       Torun, Poland, in Roman Ingarden’s office.


       2    Formulation of the Problem
       The evolution of a closed (isolated) quantum system is described by the Schrödinger equation
       (here and henceforth, Planck’s constant ~ = 1)
                                        iψ̇ = Hψ       ←→         ψt = Ut ψ0 ,                             (1)
       where ψ is the wave function, H the Hamiltonian, the dot denotes time derivative and Ut = e−iHt
       is a one-parameter group. This translates into the so-called von Neumann equation for the
       density matrix ρ
                                    ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] ←→ ρt = Ut ρ0 Ut† .                              (2)
       If the quantum system is “open”, namely not isolated, and immersed in an environment with
       which it interacts, the above equation is not valid and must be replaced by the following evolution
       law                                                X
                                           ρ0 = Λρ =          Kα ρKα† ,                                (3)
                                                              α
                   †
              P
       where    α Kα Kα = I. Notice that if the summation is made up of a single addendum K = U =
       e−iHt , (3) reduces to (2). Notice also that (3) is not a differential equation, but rather takes a
       “snapshot” of the quantum state at a particular time t0 : ρ0 = ρt0 .

concise, once in a while.)

     Gorini had already visited Sudarshan in Texas from Fall 1971 to Spring 1973, but they were working on the
classification of positive (not completely positive) maps.

         Equation (3) defines a quantum channel and Λ is usually called a superoperator. It is
      assumed to be linear, it must preserve trace and hermiticity, and it must be completely positive.
      We shall delve into these properties in the following.
         In the Markovian approximation, (3) yields the following differential (“master”) equation

                                          ρ̇ = Lρ   ←→      ρt = etL ρ0 ,                           (4)

      where L is the generator of a (one-parameter) quantum dynamical semigroup. The evolution
      (4) inherits from (3) linearity, trace- and hermiticity-preservation, and complete positivity.
          Our focus will be on the mathematical structure of (4), but also on (3). Physicists did not
      pay much attention to open quantum systems until rather recently, when, with the advent of
      the quantum era, topics such as quantum information and quantum technologies became crucial
      for the foundations and applications of quantum mechanics.


      3      The Structure of the GKLS Generator
      The central problem addressed by Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan and Lindblad (GKLS) [2, 3]
      was the characterization of the generator L of a quantum dynamical semigroup. Consider
      quantum states, represented by density operators ρ ∈ T+ (H) (positive trace-class operators) with
      ||ρ||1 = Trρ = 1. The axioms for a dynamical semigroup had been elaborated by Kossakowski
      in 1972 [4] (see also [5]): it is a one-parameter family of maps Λt : T (H) → T (H) satisfying
          1. Λt is a positive map, i.e. Λt : T+ (H) → T+ (H),
          2. Λt is strongly continuous,
          3. Λt Λs = Λt+s , for all t, s ≥ 0 (Markov property).




                                                        3
Now, the celebrated Hille-Yosida theorem [6] states that there exists a densely defined generator
                                                 1
                                        Lρ = lim (Λt ρ − ρ) ,                                          (5)
                                             t→0 t

such that
                                              Λ̇t = LΛt ,                                              (6)
together with the initial condition limt→0 Λt ρ = ρ. The problem is to characterize the properties
of L such that the solution of (6) defines a dynamical semigroup Λt . This problem is still open
nowadays.
    In their two seminal papers [2, 3], GKLS considered a restricted problem: first of all they
focused on a subclass of positive maps — completely positive maps (see Sect. 5). Moreover,
  1. GKS considered only finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. dim H = N < ∞.
  2. Lindblad considered the infinite-dimensional case, but replaced strong continuity by uni-
     form continuity. This considerably simplifies the analysis, since uniform continuity implies
     that the corresponding generator (5) defines a bounded operator (see [7] for the analysis
     of unbounded generators).
A few technical details will help us clarify. Let MN denote the algebra of N × N complex
matrices. GKS worked in the Schrödinger picture and arrived at the following result:
Theorem 1 (Theorem 2.2 in [2]). A linear operator L : MN → MN is the generator of a
completely positive semigroup of MN if it can be expressed in the following form

                                          N 2 −1
                                        1 X                                    
                        Lρ = −i[H, ρ] +          ckl [Fk , ρFl∗ ] + [Fk ρ, Fl∗ ] ,                     (7)
                                        2
                                              k,l=1


where H = H ∗ , trH = 0, trFk = 0, tr(Fk Fl∗ ) = δkl , k, l = 1, 2, . . . , N 2 −1, and [ckl ] is a complex
positive matrix.
    We shall call (7) the GKS form of the GKLS generator and [ckl ] the Kossakowski matrix.
Given a basis Fk , the generator is fully determined by the Hamiltonian H and the Kossakowski
matrix.
    On the other hand, Lindblad worked in the Heisenberg picture at the level of B(H) — the
algebra of bounded operators on H. Using completely different techniques he arrived at
Theorem 2 (Theorem 2 in [3]). A linear operator L∗ : B(H) → B(H) is the generator of a
completely positive semigroup if and only if
                                               X              1            
                          L∗ X = i[H, X] +            Vj∗ XVj − {Vj∗ Vj , X} ,                         (8)
                                                j
                                                               2

where Vj , j Vj∗ Vj ∈ B(H), {A, B} = AB + BA, and H is a self-adjoint element in B(H).
          P
The corresponding generator in the Schrödinger picture is of the form
                                               1 X                            
                          Lρ = −i[H, ρ] +           [Vj , ρVj∗ ] + [Vj ρ, Vj∗ ] .                      (9)
                                               2 j

   We shall call (9) the Lindblad form of the GKLS generator. Observe that in (9) the choice
of H and Vj is not unique, whereas in (7), after fixing the basis Fl , the traceless Hamiltonian is
uniquely defined.




                                                      4
      Remark 1. By GKLS (or standard) form of the generator one usually understands
                                                           1
                                       Lρ = −i[H, ρ] + Φρ − {Φ∗ I, ρ} ,                                  (10)
                                                           2
      where H is a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space of the system H, Φ is a completely
      positive map, and Φ∗ stands for its dual (Heisenberg picture). Equivalently, representing
                                                   X
                                            Φρ =       Vj ρVj∗ ,                                (11)
                                                          j

      one gets
                                                  1X
                              Lρ = −i[H, ρ] +         (2Vj ρVj∗ − Vj∗ Vj ρ − ρVj∗ Vj ) .                 (12)
                                                  2 j

      In the unbounded case there are examples of generators which are not of the standard form
      (cf. [7]).
         This is what GKLS obtained in 1975–1976. A few years later, Alicki and Lendi [8] published
      a monograph, presenting both the theory and physical applications of Markovian semigroups.
      Modern monographs include Weiss [9], Breuer and Petruccione [10], and Rivas and Huelga [11].3


      4     Master (Kinetic) Equations before GKLS
      Master equations — also known as kinetic equations — were used to describe dissipative phe-
      nomena long before the GKLS articles. Let us briefly review their interesting history. It is of
      great interest to analyze the structure of these equations, that in some cases is very similar to
      GKLS. In general (but not always), physicists cared about positivity and trace-preservation.
      Nobody knew (and bothered) about complete positivity before GKLS.

      4.1     Landau’s approach to the damping problem
      Already in 1927 Landau [12] derived a kinetic equation for the elements of the density matrix of
      the radiation field interacting with charged matter (in the dipole approximation). Remarkably,
      in the same article Landau introduced for the first time the concept of density matrix (that would
      be defined in a more formal way the same year by von Neumann [13]). In modern language the
      Landau equation may be (re)written as follows
                                                1
                                         ρ̇ =     γ(2aρa∗ − ρa∗ a − a∗ aρ) ,                             (13)
                                                2
      where a and a∗ are the annihilation and creation operators for the radiation field, and γ > 0 is
      a damping constant. This is the correct form of the master equation. Notice that a and a∗ are
      unbounded.

      4.2     Optical potential
      In optics, the interaction between light and a refractive and absorptive medium is described
      by introducing a complex refractive index, whose imaginary component absorbs light. In close
      analogy, during the golden years of nuclear physics, the so-called “optical potentials” were often
      used to describe the coherent scattering of slow neutrons travelling through matter [14–17]. The

     Interestingly, R. Alicki, H.-P. Breuer, F. Petruccione and S. Huelga were among the participants of the 48th SMP
in Toruń.

scattering and absorption of nucleons (such as neutrons) by nuclei was treated by averaging
effective neutron-nucleus interaction potentials over many nuclei, to yield a neutron-matter
(complex) optical potential.
    We use in the following modern language. Let V ≥ 0 be a non-negative operator (“optical”
potential). The non-Hermitian “Hamiltonian”

                                        H 0 = H − iV ,                                         (14)

yields the evolution
                                       ψ = e(−iH−V )t ψ0 ,                                     (15)
where ψ0 is the initial wave function and V is switched on at some instant of time or some
position in space (when the particle impinges on the nucleus). The density matrix evolves
according to
                                 ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] − (V ρ + ρV ) .                         (16)
The trace is not preserved and probabilities are not conserved (particle absorption). Notice that
if V were not positive-defined, probabilities would be allowed to become larger than 1 (particle
creation). Optical potentials have played an important role in nuclear physics.

4.3    Lamb equation
Lamb, analyzing the theory of the optical maser [18], considered the following equation for the
(unnormalized) density matrix ρ of a 2-level atom (equation (18) in [18]):
                                                 1
                                  ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] − (Γρ + ρΓ) ,                                  (17)
                                                 2
where Γ is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal elements γ1 and γ2 , the decay constants of
the two states of the atom. This equation generates the legitimate evolution
                                                     1         1
                             ρ0 −→ ρt = e(−iH− 2 Γ)t ρ0 e(iH− 2 Γ)t ,                          (18)

but it is not trace-preserving. Like with an optical potential (preceding subsection) positivity
of Γ implies trρ̇ < 0.
    Compare (16) and (17) with (12): the (jump) terms 2V ρV and ΓρΓ are missing. It is clear
that the Lamb equation (17) may be “cured” by adding to the r.h.s. an additional term “Φρ”,
where Φ is an arbitrary completely positive map such that Φ∗ I = Γ. In this way, Lamb’s
becomes a legitimate GKLS equation. Similarly for (16).

4.4    Redfield equation
Redfield, using the Born-Markov approximation, derived the following Markovian master equa-
tion [19]                                   X
                            ρ̇ = −i[H, ρ] −   [Vα , Xα ρ − ρXα† ] ,                    (19)

where the operators Vk are defined via the system–bath interaction Hamiltonian HI =        α V α ⊗ Bα ,
and
                                             ∞

                                         β   0

hαβ (t) = tr(Beα (t)Bβ ρB ) being the two-point bath correlation function, ρB the initial state of
the bath, and tilde stands for the interaction picture. It is obvious that trρt = trρ0 . However,
the positivity of ρt is not guaranteed (cf. the detailed discussion in [20]).



                                                 6
4.5    Quantum optics
Master equations of the form (4) for the density operator ρ, with L having the form of GKLS
generator (5)–(7), were used in quantum optics long before the GKLS articles [2,3]. For example,
the Stuttgart group (Weidlich, Haake, Risken and Haken) [21–23], working on the theory of the
laser, derived the following equation for the statistical operator R of the laser field
                                                      ∂R 
                                  Ṙ = −i[H, R] +               ,                           (21)
                                                       ∂t incoh
where the incoherent term is given by
                  ∂R 
                              = ν([b, Rb∗ ] + [bR, b∗ ]) + δ([b∗ , Rb] + [b∗ R, b]) ,           (22)
                   ∂t incoh
b and b∗ are the annihilation and creation operators of the field mode, ν is determined by the
coupling between the laser field and the atoms, and
                                           δ = e−Ω~/kT ν ,                                      (23)
with T being the temperature of the atoms. Moreover, the same authors recovered the well-
known formula for the mean number of thermal photons
                                                 δ       1
                                   nth (T ) =       = Ω~/kT    .                                (24)
                                                ν−δ   e     −1
This proves that the master equation (21) properly describes the interaction
                                                                          √      of the laser
                                                                                            √ field
with atomic matter. Clearly, (21) has exactly the form of (12), with V1 = 2ν b and V2 = 2δ b∗ ,
showing that the GKLS master equation worked perfectly well ten years before GKLS’s papers
[2, 3]. This research is summarized in Haken’s book [24] and the review papers by Haake [25]
and Agarwal [26]. The same equation was independently used at the same time by Shen [27]
and the slightly isolated Russian school of Belavin et al. [28] and Zel’dovich et al. [29] (this list
is by no means exhaustive).

4.6    Davies approach to Markovian Master Equations
In a series of papers [30 – 33] (see also the book [34]) Davies presented a general approach to
Markovian master equations (6) using the so-called weak-coupling limit. Based on the Nakajima-
Zwanzig projection techniques [35,36] (see also [37,38]) and van Hove’s idea of time rescaling [39],
Davies derived the following form of the generator (in the interaction picture)
                             XXn
                  Lρ =                 − isαβ (ω)[Vβ† (ω)Vα (ω), ρ]
                               ω   α,β
                               1                                                 o
                              + bhαβ (ω)([Vα (ω)ρ, Vβ† (ω)] + [Vα (ω), ρVβ† (ω)]) ,             (25)
                               2
where ω are the Bohr frequencies of the system Hamiltonian, b
                                                            hαβ (ω) denotes the Fourier trans-
form of the two-point correlation function, and
                                                       Z∞ b
                                               1          hαβ (ξ)
                                    sαβ (ω) =    P                dξ ,                          (26)
                                              2π           ξ−ω
                                                    −∞

with P denoting the principal part. Bochner’s theorem [40] implies that the Kossakowski matrix
cαβ = 21 ω b
        P
            hαβ (ω) is positive definite and hence the generator defined by (25) is a legitimate
GKLS generator. It is usually called a Davies generator and many physical systems are properly
described by (25).

4.7    Quantum stochastic processes
In the ’70s there was a parallel activity on quantum stochastic processes. This topic is closely
related to the notion of complete positivity and has a nontrivial overlap with the theory of master
equations developed by GKLS. For a historical review of this interesting activity, see [41].


5     Complete Positivity and its Appearance in Physics
Let us now look at a central hypothesis in the derivation of a quantum master equation. The
very concept of complete positivity was introduced by Stinespring in a seminal paper [42]. Let
us recall that a linear map Φ between two C ∗ -algebras A and B is positive if Φa ≥ 0 for each
a ≥ 0 (a ≥ 0 if a = xx∗ for some x ∈ A). Now, one calls a linear map Φ k-positive if the
k-amplification
                                1lk ⊗ Φ : Mk ⊗ A −→ Mk ⊗ B ,                              (27)
is positive, Mk being the algebra of k × k complex matrices. Finally, Φ is completely positive
(CP) if it is k-positive for all k ∈ N. A remarkable result due to Stinespring consists in the
following
Theorem 3. Let A be a unital C ∗ -algebra and let Φ : A → B(H) be a CP map. Then there
exists a Hilbert space K, a unital ∗-homomorphism π : A → B(K), and a bounded operator
V : H → K, with ||ΦI|| = ||V ||2 , such that

                                        Φa = V π(a)V ∗ ,                                      (28)

for all a ∈ A.
    The notion of CP maps slowly appeared in the mathematical literature in the ’60s. Naka-
mura, Takesaki and Umegaki [43] proved that “the conditional expectation in a not necessarily
commutative probability is completely positive in the sense of Stinespring”. In his review on
positive maps [44] Størmer included completely positive maps and introduced the notion of pos-
itive decomposable map (see also [45] and the recent monograph [46]). In a seminal paper [47],
Woronowicz showed that all maps Φ : Mn → Mm with mn ≤ 6, if positive, are automatically
decomposable. Another seminal paper developing the concept of completely positive maps is
due to Arveson [48], who introduced the notions of completely bounded, completely contractive
and completely isometric maps (see the recent monograph [49]).
    In physics the importance of completely positive maps was first recognized by the German
school of mathematical physics (Ludwig, Haag, Kraus, Hellwig and others) [50 – 53]. In his
seminal paper [54], Kraus introduced the notion of quantum operation Φ. Let us quote from [55]:
      . . . for physical reason the mapping Φ must have still another property, called com-
      plete positivity and being somehow stronger than “ordinary” positivity, such that the
      mapping Φ is given by
                                              Xr
                                        ΦA =     Kα AKα∗ .                                  (29)
                                                α

    This is the celebrated Kraus representation. Interestingly, a few years later Choi [56, 57]
derived (29) without the knowledge of Kraus’ work (GKLS cite both Kraus and Choi). Choi
observed that in a finite-dimensional setting the map Φ is completely positive if and only if the
following (so-called Choi) matrix
                                       C = (1ln ⊗ Φ)Pn+ ,                                    (30)
is positive definite (Pn+ is a projector onto the maximally entangled state in Cn ⊗ Cn , and
1ln is the identity map in Mn ). Remarkably, complete positivity reduces to the positivity of



                                                8
1ln ⊗ Φ on a single projector Pn+ . It is therefore clear that complete positivity introduces a great
simplification for the analysis of dynamical maps and the corresponding master equations.
    How did GKLS learn about complete positivity? The Advanced Study Institute on “Founda-
tions of Quantum Mechanics and Ordered Linear Spaces” was held in Marburg between March
26th and April 6th, 1973. In the introduction to the Proceedings of this meeting one reads:
      Mathematicians and physicists participated in the meeting. The lectures of the Insti-
      tute were intended to prepare a common basis for discussion between mathematicians
      and physicists for the future research and on foundations of quantum mechanics by or-
      dered linear spaces. A series of lectures (“Course”) provided a coherent introduction
      into the field of ordered normed vector spaces and their application to the foundation
      of quantum mechanics. Additional lectures treated special mathematical and physical
      topics, which were in more or less connection to the lectures of the course.
In the list of mathematical lectures one finds a lecture by E. Størmer on “Positive linear maps
of C ∗ -algebras”. The list of physics lectures contains those of G. Ludwig on “Measuring and
preparing processes” and K. Kraus on “Operations and effects in the Hilbert space formulation
of quantum theory”. V. Gorini contributed with the talk “Irreversibility and dynamical maps
of statistical operators”. After the Marburg meeting Gorini went to Texas and spread the
good news of complete positivity to Kossakowski and Sudarshan. He then met Lindblad in
Stockholm in January 1975 (see Lindblad’s recollection in Sect. 8). Lindblad was already aware
of this concept, having used it in his 1974 proof of a fundamental property of quantum relative
entropy [58] (quantum relative entropy is monotonic with respect to completely positive trace
preserving maps, called nowadays quantum channels).


6 Positivity vs. Complete Positivity — the Great Simpli-
fication
Due to Stinespring’s theorem, completely positive maps are fully characterized. The problem
of the characterization of positive maps is still open and is equivalent to the characterization
of the entangled states of bipartite quantum systems [59, 60]. In the beginning of the ’70s Kos-
sakowski (still without the knowledge of complete positivity) addressed the problem of finding
the necessary and sufficient conditions for a bounded generator L of the semigroup of positive
maps Λt = etL for t ≥ 0. Note that if Λt is trace-preserving and hermiticity-preserving (i.e.
Λt X ∗ = (Λt X)∗ ), then any (bounded) generator must have the standard form (10)
                                                    1
                                Lρ = −i[H, ρ] + Φρ − {Φ∗ I, ρ} ,                                (31)
                                                    2
with Φ a hermiticity-preserving map. GKLS proved that the corresponding dynamical map etL
is completely positive iff the map Φ is completely positive as well. What happens if etL is only
positive? In such a case, the positivity of Φ is only sufficient, but not necessary! Kossakowski
proved the following [61]
Theorem 4. A bounded linear operator L on T (H) generates a dynamical  P     semigroup Λt if and
only if for every resolution of identity Pi Pj = δij Pi , trPi < ∞, and i Pi = IH one has

                                     tr(Pi LPj ) ≥ 0 ,   i 6= j ,                               (32)
      P
and       i tr(Pi LPj ) = 0.

   Unfortunately, the general structure of L satisfying (32) is not known. It is clear that if
dim H = N < ∞, then L has the structure defined by (7), but there is no simple condition for



                                                 9
       the matrix [ckl ]. As an example [62] consider N = 2 and
                                                      3
                                                      X
                                             Lρ =           γk (σk ρσk − ρ) ,                              (33)
                                                      k=1

       that is, the Kossakowski
                         P3     matrix ckl = γk δkl is diagonal. L is a GKLS generator iff γk ≥ 0, that
       is, the map Φρ = k=1 γk σk ρσk is completely positive. However, L satisfies (32) iff

                                   γ1 + γ2 ≥ 0 ,     γ2 + γ3 ≥ 0 ,      γ3 + γ1 ≥ 0 .                      (34)

       These conditions, which are much weaker than γk ≥ 0, do not guarantee the positivity of the
       map Φ. For example, by taking γ1 = γ2 = −γ3 = 1 one finds Φρ = σ1 ρσ1 + σ2 ρσ2 − σ3 ρσ3
       which is not positive, although the γ’s satisfy the conditions (34). It is therefore clear that the
       positivity of Φ is not necessary for the positivity of the dynamical map etL .
          A similar problem was addressed in 1969 by Belavin et al. [28]. They analyzed the following
       kinetic equation (equation (14) in [28])
                                             N
                                          1 X
                                   ρ̇ =           γij (2Ai ρA†j − A†j Ai ρ − ρA†j Ai ) .                   (35)
                                          2 i,j=1

       Clearly, being not aware of complete positivity, they simply looked for the evolution ρ0 → ρt =
       Λt ρ0 realized by a family of positive maps Λt . If N = 1 they showed that ρt is a legitimate
       density matrix for all t ≥ 0 iff γ > 0 (in this case there is only a single γ). Hence for a single
       dissipation/decoherence channel the correct form of the generator was already known in 1969!
       The authors claimed: it is not difficult to generalize the proof given here to the case N > 1.
       The answer they provided (without proof) reads: the matrix [γij ] has to be positive definite.
       Clearly, this is very intuitive, but as we know this condition is both necessary and sufficient for
       complete positivity, but it is not necessary for the simple positivity required in [28]. This example
       shows that the condition for the positivity of the Kossakowski matrix [γij ] was anticipated as a
       natural generalization of positivity for a single dissipative channel. However, only GKLS proved
       the consistency of this condition with the complete positivity of the dynamical map. The spirit
       of the article by Belavin et al. [28] is nonetheless very close to that of the GKLS papers. It is
       unfortunate that their work is not well known.4
           In his recent book, Weinberg [64] wrote: The Lindblad equation can be derived as a straight-
       forward application of an earlier result by A. Kossakowski [4], eq. (77). This interesting state-
       ment can be considered correct or incorrect (depending on the viewpoint and level of rigor one
       adopts) and shows how delicate questions of priority can be. In his 1972 paper Kossakowski
       wrote the right equation using only positivity, and from those premises one cannot obtain the
       GKLS equation, whose proof requires complete positivity.


       7     The Mystery of Sudarshan-Mathews-Rau Paper
       In 1961 Sudarshan, Mathews, and Rau [65] published a remarkable paper entitled Stochastic
       Dynamics of Quantum Mechanical Systems. In the abstract the authors state:
             The most general dynamical law for a quantum mechanical system with a finite num-
             ber of levels is formulated. A fundamental role is played by the so-called “dynamical
   4
    The article by Belavin et al. [28] has been recently cited in [63]. We wonder if this is because one of the authors
– Victor Albert – participated in the 48th SMP. If our guess is correct, this proves that the SMP meetings can be
particularly useful for young and promising physicists!




                                                             10
     matrix” whose properties are stated in a sequence of theorems. A necessary and suffi-
     cient criterion for distinguishing dynamical matrices corresponding to a Hamiltonian
     time-dependence is formulated.
Sudarshan, Mathews, and Rau analyzed the evolution of the density matrix represented by the
following linear relation            X
                           ρrs (t) =    Ars,r0 s0 (t, t0 )ρr0 s0 (t0 )                 (36)
                                                            r 0 ,s0

and found that ρrs (t) defines a density matrix for t > t0 if and only if the A matrix satisfies the
following properties:

                                          Asr,s0 r0 = Ars,r0 s0 ,                 (Hermiticity)
                     X
                                 xr xs Ars,r0 s0 yr0 ys0 ≥ 0 ,                    (positivity)             (37)
                   r,s,r 0 ,s0
                                       X
                                                Arr,r0 s0 = δr0 s0 .              (trace-preservation) .
                                          r

If one knows how to represent a matrix satisfying the above properties, the problem is solved.
However, as the authors remarked, these conditions are fairly complicated. In order to solve the
problem they proposed to analyze the matrix B defined by

                                                        Brr0 ,ss0 := Ars,r0 s0 .                           (38)

In modern language, B, which was named dynamical matrix in [65], is nothing but the realign-
ment of A (see e.g. [66]). Now, the authors claimed (without proof) that properties (37) lead
to the following properties of B

                                      Brr0 ,ss0 = Bss0 ,rr0 ,                    (Hermiticity)
                        X
                                   z rr0 Brr0 ,ss0 zss0 ≥ 0 ,                    (positivity)              (39)
                     r,s,r 0 ,s0
                                     X
                                              Brr0 ,rs0 = δr0 s0 ,               (trace-preservation) .
                                      r

Finally, they derived the remarkable result that B satisfies (39) if and only if there exists a set
of parameters µα ≥ 0, and a collection of n × n complex matrices Wα , such that
                                                                  2
                                                               n
                                                               X
                                       B   rr 0 ,ss0    =             µα (Wα )rr0 (Wα )ss0 .               (40)
                                                              α=1

In such a case, the evolution of ρ is realized via
                                                                      2
                                                                  n
                                                                  X
                                                    ρ 7−→                 µα Wα ρWα† ,                     (41)
                                                                  α=1

                   Pn2
where µα ≥ 0, and α=1 µα Wα† Wα = I. This is nothing but the celebrated Kraus representation
(29) of a quantum channel, derived almost ten years before Kraus [54]! How was it possible
to derive the Kraus representation without making any use of completely positive maps? Note
that in passing from (37) to (39) there is a gap. The second condition for B should read
                                  X
                                        xr xs Brr0 ,ss0 yr0 ys0 ≥ 0 .                    (42)
                                              r,s,r 0 ,s0




                                                                          11
This condition states that the dynamical matrix B is not necessarily positive but only block-
positive (cf. [66]). This was a prophetic error, anticipating the Kraus representation of a quan-
tum channel. It is clear that this remarkable paper was written too early and the community
in 1961 was not prepared to grasp its elegance and predictive power!
    In modern language, B is nothing but the Choi matrix corresponding to the dynamical
map, and condition (39) is, as Choi proved in 1975 [57], equivalent to complete positivity.
The weaker condition (42) was proved by Jamiolkowski [67] to be equivalent to the positivity
of the map. The correspondence “map ←→ B-matrix” is usually called Choi-Jamiolkowski
isomorphism. Actually, such correspondence and its properties were analyzed by de Pillis [68]
in 1967 (Kossakowski cited [68] in his 1972 paper [4], in connection with semi-groups of positive
maps). See also the recent review [69]. Clearly, this correspondence was already noted in [65].


8    Recollection from Göran Lindblad
Unfortunately, Göran Lindblad was unable to participate in the 48th SMP meeting in Toruń.
However, he sent the following “recollection slide” to the organizers:
     In the Spring of 1974 I received a letter from Professor Ingarden (dated June 22)
     inviting me to take part and give a seminar on entropy and related problems (the
     subject of my recent thesis). I answered that I would be glad to come, but that I would
     prefer to talk about some even more recent results on quantum dynamical semigroups.
     I had only just realized that the CP condition makes the structure so much simpler.
     In fact, after passing my thesis in May 1974, I went back to my desk to consider the
     problem, and after a week or so I realized that I knew how to make an ‘if and only if
     proof ’. I was quite euphoric for a week or two, and then considered how and where
     to publish.
         When I got Prof. Ingarden’s letter, I decided to use the conference for a first
     announcement.
         After my talk (December 5) Prof. Ingarden told me that he had received news from
     Texas of similar results. Later, in January 1975, Vittorio Gorini passed through
     Stockholm on his way back home, and we could compare things and agree that there
     was a good deal of overlap, in fact the results were essentially the same, save for the
     mathematical machinery.


9    Conclusions and Outlook
In retrospect, there were a number of concomitant factors that led to the precise mathematical
formulation of the evolution equations for open quantum dynamical systems. The chronology of
some of these episodes is summarized in Table 1. We leave to the wisdom of Noam Chomsky [1]
the final judgement on the “level of significance” at which there are differences and similarities.
    In our humble opinion, there are many similarities, and also a few differences, among the
seminal articles discussed in this note. We venture to suggest that (4), with (7), (9) and (10),
be named “Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) equation” and (3) the “Kraus-
Stinespring-Sudarshan (KSS) representation”.
