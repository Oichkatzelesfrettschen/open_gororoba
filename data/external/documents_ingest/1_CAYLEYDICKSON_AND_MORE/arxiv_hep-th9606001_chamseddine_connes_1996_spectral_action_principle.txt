                                    We propose a new action principle to be associated with a noncommutative space
                                    (A, H, D). The universal formula for the spectral action is (ψ, Dψ) + Trace(χ(D/
                                    Λ)) where ψ is a spinor on the Hilbert space, Λ is a scale and χ a positive func-
                                    tion. When this principle is applied to the noncommutative space defined by the
                                    spectrum of the standard model one obtains the standard model action coupled to
                                    Einstein plus Weyl gravity. There are relations between the gauge coupling con-
                                    stants identical to those of SU (5) as well as the Higgs self-coupling, to be taken
                                    at a fixed high energy scale.




                                                                             1
1. Introduction.
     The basic data of Riemannian geometry consists in a manifold M whose
points x ∈ M are locally labelled by finitely many coordinates xµ ∈ R, and in the
infinitesimal line element, ds,

                                 ds2 = gµν dxµ dxν .                             (1.1)

The laws of physics at reasonably low energies are well encoded by the action
functional,
                                   I = IE + ISM                              (1.2)
                1
                   R   √
where IE = 16πG      R g d4 x is the Einstein action, which depends only upon
the 4-geometry (we shall work throughout in the Euclidean, i.e. imaginary time
                                                                   R
formalism) and where ISM is the standard model action, ISM = LSM , LSM =
LG + LGH + LH + LGf + LHf . The action functional ISM involves, besides the
4-geometry, several additional fields: bosons G of spin 1 such as γ, W ± and Z,
and the eight gluons, bosons of spin 0 such as the Higgs field H and fermions f of
spin 1/2, the quarks and leptons.
These additional fields have a priori a very different status than the geometry
(M, g) and the gauge invariance group which governs their interaction is a priori
very different from the diffeomorphism group which governs the invariance of the
Einstein action. In fact the natural group of invariance of the functional (1.2) is
the semidirect product,
                                G = U >⊳ Diff(M )                             (1.3)
of the group of local gauge transformations, U = C ∞ (M, U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3))
by the natural action of Diff(M ).
The basic data of noncommutative geometry consists of an involutive algebra A
of operators in Hilbert space H and of a selfadjoint unbounded operator D in H
[1-6].
The inverse D−1 of D plays the role of the infinitesimal unit of length ds of ordinary
geometry.
To a Riemannian compact spin manifold corresponds the spectral triple given by
the algebra A = C ∞ (M ) of smooth functions on M , the Hilbert space H =
L2 (M, S) of L2 -spinors and the Dirac operator D of the Levi-Civita Spin connec-
tion. The line element ds is by construction the propagator of fermions,

                                     ds = ×—× .                                  (1.4)

                                          2
No information is lost in trading the original Riemannian manifold M for the
corresponding spectral triple (A, H, D). The points of M are recovered as the
characters of the involutive algebra A, i.e. as the homomorphisms ρ : A → C
(linear maps such that ρ(ab) = ρ(a) ρ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A). The geodesic distance
between points is recovered by

               d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} .            (1.5)

More importantly one can characterize the spectral triples (A, H, D) which come
from the above spinorial construction by very simple axioms ([4]) which involve
the dimension n of M . The parity of n implies a Z/2 grading γ of the Hilbert
space H such that,

                γ = γ ∗ , γ 2 = 1 , γa = aγ   ∀ a ∈ A , γD = −Dγ .               (1.6)

Moreover one keeps track of the real structure on H as an antilinear isometry J in
H satisfying simple relations

              J 2 = ε , JD = ε′ DJ , Jγ = ε′′ γJ ; ε, ε′ , ε′′ ∈ {−1, 1}         (1.7)

where the value of ε, ε′ , ε′′ is determined by n modulo 8. One first virtue of these
axioms is to allow for a shift of point of view, similar to Fourier transform, in which
the usual emphasis on the points x ∈ M of a geometric space is now replaced by
the spectrum Σ ⊂ R of the operator D. Indeed, if one forgets about the algebra
A in the spectral triple (A, H, D) but retains only the operators D, γ and J
acting in H one can (using (1.7)) characterize this data by the spectrum Σ of D
which is a discrete subset with multiplicity of R. In the even case Σ = −Σ. The
existence of Riemannian manifolds which are isospectral (i.e. have the same Σ)
but not isometric shows that the following hypothesis is stronger than the usual
diffeomorphism invariance of the action of general relativity,

                   “The physical action only depends upon Σ .”                   (1.8)

In order to apply this principle to the action (1.2) we need to exploit a second
virtue of the axioms (cf. [4]) which is that they do not require the commutativity
of the algebra A. Instead one only needs the much weaker form,

                    ab0 = b0 a ∀ a, b ∈ A with b0 = Jb∗ J −1 .                   (1.9)

                                          3
In the usual Riemannian case the group Diff(M ) of diffeomorphisms of M is
canonically isomorphic to the group Aut(A) of automorphisms of the algebra
A = C ∞ (M ). To each ϕ ∈ Diff(M ) one associates the algebra preserving map
αϕ : A → A given by

                    αϕ (f ) = f ◦ ϕ−1          ∀ f ∈ C ∞ (M ) = A .        (1.10)

In general the group Aut(A) of automorphisms of the involutive algebra A plays
the role of the diffeomorphisms of the noncommutative (or spectral for short)
geometry (A, H, D). The first interesting new feature of the general case is that
the group Aut(A) has a natural normal subgroup,

                                Int(A) ⊂ Aut(A)                            (1.11)

where an automorphism α is inner iff there exists a unitary operator u ∈ A,
(uu∗ = u∗ u = 1) such that,

                            α(a) = uau∗           ∀a ∈ A.                  (1.12)

The corresponding exact sequence of groups,

                     1 → Int(A) → Aut(A) → Out(A) → 1                      (1.13)

looks very similar to the exact sequence

                          1 → U → G → Diff(M ) → 1                         (1.14)

which describes the structure of the symmetry group G of the action functional
(1.2).
Comparing (1.13) and (1.14) and taking into account the action of inner automor-
phisms of A in H given by

                              ξ → u(u∗ )0 ξ = uξu∗                         (1.15)

                                       g
one determines the algebra A such that Aut(A)            g takes into account
                                              = G (where Aut
the action of automorphisms in the Hilbert space H). The answer is

                               A = C ∞ (M ) ⊗ AF                           (1.16)

where the algebra AF is finite dimensional,

                                   AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3 (C)                              (1.17)

where H ⊂ M2 (C) is the algebra of quaternions,
                                                               

Giving the algebra A does not suffice to determine the spectral geometry, one
still needs the action of A in H and the operator D. Since A is a tensor product
(16) which geometrically corresponds to a product space, an instance of spectral
geometry for A is given by the product rule,

                   H = L2 (M, S) ⊗ HF , D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF                       (1.19)

where (HF , DF ) is a spectral geometry on AF , while both L2 (M, S) and the Dirac
operator ∂/M on M are as above.
Since AF is finite dimensional the dimension of the corresponding space is 0 so
that HF must be finite dimensional. The list of elementary fermions provides a
natural candidate for HF . One lets HF be the Hilbert space with basis labelled
by elementary leptons and quarks. Thus for the first generation of leptons we get
eL , eR , νL , ēL , ēR , ν̄L for instance, as the corresponding basis. The Z/2 grading γF
is given by +1 for left handed particles and −1 for right handed ones. For quarks
one has an additional color index, y, r, b. The involution J is just such that Jf = f¯
for any f in the basis. One has J 2 = 1, Jγ = γJ as dictated by the dimension
n = 0. Moreover the algebra AF has a natural representation in HF and:

                      ab0 = b0 a      ∀ a, b ∈ AF , b0 = Jb∗ J −1 .                 (1.20)

Finally there is a natural matrix acting in the finite dimensional Hilbert space HF .
It is                                            
                                          Y 0
                                  DF =              ,                          (1.21)
                                           0 Ȳ
where Y is the Yukawa coupling matrix.
The special features of Y show that the algebraic rule

                             [[D, a], b0] = 0         ∀ a, b ∈ A                    (1.22)

                                             5
which is one of the essential axioms, holds for the spectral geometry (AF , HF , DF )
= F . Of course this 0-dimensional geometry is encoding the knowledge of the
fermions of the standard model and it is a basic question to understand and char-
acterize it abstractly, but let us postpone this problem and proceed with the
product geometry M × F .
The next important new feature of the noncommutative case is the following. We
saw that the group Aut(A) of diffeomorphisms falls in equivalence classes under
the normal subgroup Int(A) of inner automorphisms. In the same way the space of
metrics has a natural foliation into equivalence classes. The internal fluctuations
of a given metric are given by the formula,

    D = D0 + A + JAJ −1 , A = Σ ai [D0 , bi ] , ai , bi ∈ A and A = A∗ .       (1.23)

Thus starting from (A, H, D0 ) with obvious notations, one leaves the representa-
tion of A in H untouched and just perturbs the operator D0 by (1.23) where A is
an arbitrary self-adjoint operator in H of the form A = Σ ai [D0 , bi ] ; ai , bi ∈ A.
One checks that this does not alter the axioms (check (1.22) for instance). These
fluctuations are trivial: D = D0 in the usual Riemannian case in the same way as
the group of inner automorphisms Int(A) = {1} is trivial for A = C ∞ (M ).
In general the natural action of fInt(A) on the space of metrics restricts to the
above equivalence classes and is simply given by (for the automorphism associated
to u ∈ A, uu∗ = u∗ u = 1),

                 ξ ∈ H → uξu∗ = uu∗0 ξ , A → u[D, u∗ ] + uAu∗ .                (1.24)

When one computes the internal fluctuations of the above product geometry M ×F
one finds ([6]) that they are parametrized exactly by the bosons γ, W ± , Z, the eight
gluons and the Higgs fields H of the standard model. The equality
                         Z
                                          √
                             (LGf + LHf ) g d4 x = hψ, Dψi                      (1.25)
                         M

gives the contribution to (1.2) of the last two term of the SM Lagrangian in terms
of the operator D alone.
The operator D encodes the metric of our “discrete Kaluza Klein” geometry M ×F
but this metric is no longer the product metric as it was for D0 . In fact the initial
scale given by DF completely disappears when one considers the arbitrary internal
fluctuations of D0 = ∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF . What remains is to understand in a purely

                                          6
gravitational manner the 4 remaining terms of the action (1.2). This is where we
apply the basic principle (1.8).
We shall check in this paper that for any smooth cutoff function χ, χ(λ) = 1 for
|λ| ≤ 1, one has
                       
                        D
              Trace χ       = IE + IG + IGH + IH + IC + 0(Λ−∞ )           (1.26)
                        Λ

where IC is a sum of a cosmological term, a term of Weyl gravity and a term in
R        √
  R H 2 g d4 x. The computation in itself is not new, and goes back to the work
of DeWitt [7]. Similar computations also occur in the theory of induced gravity
[8]. It is clear that the left hand side of (1.26) only depends upon the spectrum
Σ of the operator D, and following our principle (1.8) this allows to take it as the
natural candidate for the bare action at the cutoff scale Λ.
In our framework there is a natural way to cutoff the geometry at a given energy
scale Λ, which has been developed in [9] for some concrete examples. It consists
in replacing the Hilbert space H by the subspace HΛ ,
                                             
                                               D

                                               Λ

and restricting both D and A to this subspace, while maintaining the commutation
rule (1.20) for the algebra A. This procedure is superior to the familiar lattice
approximation because it does respect the geometric symmetry group. The point
is that finite dimensional noncommutative algebras have continuous Lie groups of
automorphisms while the automorphism group of a commutative finite dimensional
algebra is necessarily finite. The hypothesis which we shall test in this paper is
that there exist an energy scale Λ in the range 1015 − 1019 Gev at which the bare
action (1.2) becomes geometric, i.e. ∼

2. The spectral action principle applied to the Einstein-Yang-Mills
system.
     To test the spectral action functional (1.28) we shall first consider the sim-
plest noncommutative modification of a manifold M . Thus we replace the algebra

                                         7
C ∞ (M ) of smooth functions on M by the tensor product A = C ∞ (M ) ⊗ MN (C)
where MN (C) is the algebra of N × N matrices. The spectral triple is obtained by
tensoring the Dirac spectral triple for M by the spectral triple for MN (C) given
by the left action of MN (C) on the Hilbert space of N × N matrices with Hilbert-
Schmidt norm while the operator is 0. The real structure is given by the adjoint
operation, m → m∗ on matrices. Thus for the product geometry one has

                                    H = L2 (M, S) ⊗ MN (C)
                                       J(ξ ⊗ m) = Cξ ⊗ m∗                                        (2.1)
                                           D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 .

We shall compare the spectral action functional (1.28) with the following
                                    Z
                                1       √
                           I= 2       R g d4 x + IY M                     (2.2)

              R             √
where IY M = (LG + LGf ) g d4 x is the action for an SU (N ) Yang-Mills theory
coupled to fermions in the adjoint representation.
Starting with (2.1), one first computes the internal fluctuations of the metric and
finds that they are parametrized exactly by an SU (N ) Yang Mills field A. Note
that the formula D = D0 + A + JAJ ∗ eliminates the U (1) part of A even if one
starts with an U (N ) gauge potential.
One also checks that the coupling of the Yang Mills field A with the fermions is
equal to
                             hψ, Dψi      ψ ∈ H.                           (2.3)
The operator D = D0 + A + JAJ ∗ is given by

be treated somewhere else.

a function of eaµ .)
It is a simple exercise to compute the square of the Dirac operator given by (2.4)
[10-11]. This can be cast into the elliptic operator form [12]:

                         P = D2 = −(g µν ∂µ ∂ν · 1I + Aµ ∂µ + B)                  (2.7)

where 1I, Aµ and B are matrices of the same dimensions as D, and are given by:

                         Aµ = (2ω µ − Γµ ) ⊗ 1N − ig0 14 ⊗ Aµi T i                (2.8)
            B = (∂ µ ωµ + ω µ ωµ − Γν ων + R) ⊗ 1N − ig0 ωµ ⊗ Aµi T i .

In deriving (2.8) we have used equation (2.5) as well as the following definitions
and identities
                                                     1

                                           Γµ = g νσ Γµνσ

we have also used the symmetries of the Riemann tensor to prove that

                                       γ µν Rµνab γab = −2R .                    (2.10)

We shall now compute the spectral action for this theory given by

                                  m20

where the trace Tr is the usual trace of operators in the Hilbert space H, and m0
is a (mass) scale to be specified. The function χ is chosen to be positive and this
has important consequences for the positivity of the gravity action.

in equation (2.7).
If s = 0, −1, . . . is a non-positive integer then Tr(P −s ) is regular at this value of s

From the knowledge that the invariants of the heat equation are polynomial func-
tions of R, Rµν , Rµνρσ , E and Ωµν and their covariant derivatives, it is then evident
from equation (2.19) that the spectral action would not only be diffeomorphism
invariant but also gauge invariant. The first three invariants are then(∗)

For the special case where the dimension of the manifold M is four, we have a
relation between the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant and the three possible
curvature square terms:

                                    Rρσ . Moreover, we can change the expression
for a4 (P ) in terms of Cµνρσ instead of Rµνρσ where

                                                   1

χ(n) (0) is zero ∀ n > 0 and this removes the non-renormalizable interactions. It is,

We shall adopt Wilson’s view point of the renormalization group approach to field
theory [13] where the spectral action is taken to give the bare action with bare
quantities m0 and g0 and with a cutoff scale Λ where the theory is assumed to
take a geometrical form. Introducing the cutoff scale Λ will regularize the theory.
The perturbative expansion is then reexpressed in terms of renormalized physical
quanties. The fields also receive wave function renormalization. Normalizing the
Einstein and Yang-Mills terms in the bare action we then have:

The renormalized action receives counterterms of the same form as the bare action
but with physical parameters k, a, c, d, and the addition of one new term [14]

This adds one further boundary condition for the equations (2.29):

                                              b0 = 0 .

The renormalized fermionic action (ψ, Dψ) keeps the same form as the bare
fermionic action.
The renormalization group equations will yield relations between the bare quanti-
ties and the physical quantities with the addition of the cutoff scale Λ. Conditions
on the bare quantities would translate into conditions on the physical quantities.
In the present example only the gauge coupling g(Λ) and Newton’s constant will
have measurable effects. The dependence of κ0 on κ and the other physical quan-
tities is such that κ−2
                     0 −κ
                         −2
                             contains terms proportional to the cutoff scale. As κ2
must be identified with 8πG at low energy it is clear that both κ−1  0 and Λ could
                               (∗)
be as high as the Planck scale
The renormalization group equations of this system were studied by Fradkin and
Tseytlin [15] and is known to be renormalizable, but non-unitary [14] due to the

worry about non-unitarity (see, however, reference 16), because in our view at the
Planck energy the manifold structure of space-time will break down and one must
have a completely finite theory where only the part of the Hilbert space given by
χ(D2 )H enters. The algebra A becomes finite dimensional in such a way that all
symmetries of the continuum (in some approximation) would be admitted.
In the limit of flat space-time we have gµν = δµν and the action (2.11) becomes
(adopting the normalizations (2.29)):
                              1 i

where we have droped the constant term. This action is known to have N = 1
global supersymmetry. In reality we can also obtain the N = 2 and N = 4
super Yang-Mills actions by taking the appropriate Dirac operators in six and ten
dimensions respectively [17].



3. Spectral action for the standard model.
    Having illustrated the computation of our spectral action for the Einstein-
Yang-Mills system we now address the realistic case of obtaining action (1.2) for
the Einstein-Standard model system.
We first briefly summarize the spectral triple (A, H, D) associated with the spec-
trum of the standard model. A complete treatment can be found in [4,6].
The geometry is that of a 4-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold with a fixed
spin structure times a discrete geometry. The product geometry is given by the
rules
             A = A1 ⊗ A2 , H = H1 ⊗ H2 , D = D1 ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ D2             (3.1)
where A1 = C ∞ (M ), D1 = ∂/M the Dirac operator on M , H1 = L2 (M, S) and
the discrete geometry (A2 , H2 , D2 ) will now be described. The algebra A2 is the
direct sum of the real involutive algebras C of complex numbers, H of quaternions,
and M3 (C) of 3 × 3 matrices. H2 is the Hilbert space with basis the elementary
fermions, namely the quarks Q, leptons L and their charge conjugates, where
                                                

and we have omitted family indices for Q and L and colour index for Q. The
antilinear isometry J = J2 in H2 exchanges a fermions with its conjugate.
The action of an element a = (λ, q, m) ∈ A2 in H2 is given by:
                                            

              α β
where q =             is a quaternion. A similar formula holds for leptons. The
             −β̄ ᾱ
action on conjugate particles is:

                                       a L̄ = λ L̄
                                 a Q̄ = m Q̄ .                            (3.4)

For the operator D2 we take D2 =            where Y is a Yukawa coupling matrix
                                   0 Ȳ

The parameter µ has the dimension of mass.
The choice of the Dirac operator and the action of A2 in H2 comes from the
restrictions that these must satisfy:

                      J 2 = 1 , [J, D2 ] = 0 , [a, Jb∗ J −1 ] = 0
                              [[D, a], Jb∗J −1 ] = 0 ∀ a, b .                (3.7)

The next step is to compute the inner fluctuations of the metric and thus the
operators of the form: A = Σ ai [D, bi ]. This with the self-adjointness condition

                                            15
   A = A∗ gives a U (1), SU (2) and U (3) gauge fields as well as a Higgs field. The
   computation of A + JAJ −1 removes a U (1) part from the above gauge fields (such
   that the full matrix is traceless) (for derivation see [4]). The Dirac operator Dq
   that takes the inner fluctuations into account is given by the 36×36 matrix (acting
   on the 36 quarks) (tensored with Clifford algebras)

   the field H.
   It is a simple exercise to see that the action for the fermionic quark sector is given

Relations (3.18) among the gauge coupling constants coincide with those coming
from SU (5) unification.
To normalize the Higgs fields kinetic energy we have to rescale H by:

As explained in the last section this action has to be taken as the bare action at
some cutoff scale Λ. The renormalized action will have the same form as (3.20)
but with the bare quantities κ0 , µ0 , λ0 , a0 to e0 and g01 , g02 , g03 replaced with
physical quantities.
Relations between the bare gauge coupling constants as well as equations (3.19)
have to be imposed as boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations

                                          18
[13]. The bare mass of the Higgs field is related to the bare value of Newton’s
constant, and both have quadratic divergences in the limit of infinite cutoff Λ.
The relation between m20 and the physical quantities is:

For m2 (Λ) to be small at low-energies m20 should be tuned to be proportional to
the cutoff scale according to equation (3.22).
Similarly the bare cosmological constant is related to the physical one (which must
be tuned to zero at low energies):

where 62 is the difference between the fermionic degrees of freedom (90) and the
bosonic ones (28).
There is also a relation between the bare scale κ−2
                                                 0 and the physical one κ

is similar to equation (3.20) (but with all one-loop contributions coming with the
same sign) which shows that κ−1 0 ∼ m0 and Λ are of the same order as the Planck
mass.

Using equations (3.27) and (3.28) one easily find:

The present experimental values for α−1
                                     em (MZ ) and α3 (MZ ) are


                                α−1
                                 em (MZ ) = 128.09

                             0.110 ≤ α3 (MZ ) ≤ 0.123 .                      (3.28)

These values lead to

                        9.14 × 1014 ≤ Λ ≤ 4.44 × 1014 (Gev)
                              0.206 ≤ sin2 θw ≤ 0.210 .                      (3.29)

Therefore the bare action we obtained and associated with the spectrum of the
standard model is consistent with experimental data provided the cutoff scale is
taken to be Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. There is, however, a slight disagreement (10%) between
the predicted value of sin2 θw and the experimental value of 0.2325 known to a
very high precision. It is a remarkable fact that starting from the spectrum of
the standard model at low-energies, and assuming that this spectrum does not
change, one can get the geometrical spectral action which holds at very high-
energies and consistent within ten percent with experimental data. This can be
taken that at higher energies the noncommutative nature of space-time reveals
itself and shows that the effective theory at the scale Λ have a higher symmetry.
The other disagreement is that the gravity sector requires the cutoff scale to be of
the same order as the Planck scale while the condition on gauge coupling constants
give Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. The gravitational coupling G runs with Λ due to the matter
interactions. This dictates that it must be of the order Λ−2 and gives a large
value for Newton’s constant. These results must be taken as an indication that
the spectrum of the standard model has to be altered as we climb up in energy.

                                         20
The change may happen at low energies (just as in supersymmetry which also
pushes the cutoff scale to 1016 Gev) or at some intermediate scale. Incidently the
porblem that Newton’s constant is coming out to be too large is also present in
string theroy where also a unification of gauge couplings and Newton’s constant
occurs [20]. Ultimately one would hope that modification of the spectrum will
increase the cutoff scale nearer to the Planck mass as dictated by gravity.
    There is one further relation in our theory between the λ(H ∗ H)2 coupling
and the gauge couplings to be imposed at the scale Λ [21]:

                                                4 2 z2
                                         λ0 =    g       .                  (3.30)
                                                3 03 y 4

This relation could be simplified if we assume that the top quark Yukawa coupling
is much larger than all the other Yukawa couplings. In this case equation (3.30)
simplifies to
                                         16π
                                λ(Λ) =       α3 (Λ) .                      (3.31)
                                           3
Therefore the value of λ at the unification scale is λ0 ≃ 0.402 showing that one
does not go outside the perturbation domain. In reality, equation (3.31) could be
used, together with the RG equations for λ and kt to determine the Higgs mass
at the low-energy scale MZ [22]:

These equations have to be integrated numerically [21]. One can get a rough
estimate on the Higgs mass from the triviality bound(∗) on the λ couplings. For
Λ ≃ 1015 Gev as given in equation (3.29) the limits are

                                    160 < mH < 200 Gev .                    (3.34)

     This together with the boundary condition (3.31) gives a mass of the Higgs
near the lower bound of 160 Gev. The exact answer can be only determined
by numerical integration, but this of course cannot be completely trusted as the
predicted value for sin2 θw is off by ten percent. It can, however, be taken as an
approximate answer and in this respect one can say that the Higgs mass lies in
the interval 160 − 180 Gev. We expect this prediction to be correct to the same
precision as that of sin2 θw in (3.29).
In reality we can perform the same analysis for the gravitational sector to deter-
mine the dependence of κ0 , a0 , b0 , c0 , d0 and e0 on the physical quantities and
the effect of the boundary conditions (3.19) on them. This, however, will not have
measurable consequences and will not be pursued here.



4. Conclusions.
      The basic symmetry for a noncommutative space (A, H, D) is Aut(A). This
symmetry includes diffeomorphisms and internal symmetry transformations. The
bosonic action is a spectral function of the Dirac operator while the fermionic
action takes the simple linear form (ψ, Dψ) where ψ are spinors defined on the
Hilbert space. Applying this principle to the simple case where the algebra is
C ∞ (M )⊗Mn (C) with a Hilbert space of fermions in the adjoint representation one
finds that the bosonic action contains the Yang-Mills, Einstein and Weyl actions.
This action is to be interpreted as the bare Wilsonian action at some cutoff scale Λ.
The same principle when applied to the less trivial noncommutative geometry of
the standard model gives the standard model action coupled to Einstein and Weyl
gravity plus higher order non-renormalizable interactions supressed by powers of
the inverse of the mass scale in the theory. One also gets a mass term for the Higgs
field. This bare mass is of the same order as the cutoff scale and this is related
to the fact that there are quadratic divergences associated with the Higgs mass in
the standard model. There are some relations between the bare quantities. The
renormalized action will have the same form as the bare action but with physical
quantities replacing the bare ones (except for an R2 term which is absent in the
bare action due to the scale invariance of the a4 term associated with the square
of the Dirac operator). The relations among the bare quantities must be taken as
boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations governing the scale
dependence of the physical quantities.
    In particular there are relations among the gauge couplings coinciding with

                                         22
those of SU (5) (or any gauge group containing SU (5) and also between the Higgs
couplings to be imposed at some scale. These relations give a unification scale
(or cutoff scale) of order ∼ 1015 Gev and a value for sin2 θw ∼ 0.21 which is
off by ten percent from the true value. We also have a prediction of the Higgs
mass in the interval 160 − 180 Gev. This can be taken as an indication that the
noncommutative structure of space-time reveals itself at such high scale where the
effective action has a geometrical interpretation.
    The slight disagreement with experiment indicates that the spectrum of the
standard model could not be extrapolated to very high energies without adding
new particles necessary to change the RG equations of the gauge couplings. One
possibility could be supersymmetry, but there could be also less drastic solutions.
It might be tempting by changing the spectrum to push the unification scale up
nearer to the Planck scale a situation which is also present in string theory.

     In summary, we have succeeded in finding a universal action formula that
unified the standard model with the Einstein action. This necessarily involved an
extrapolation from the low-energy sector to 1015 Gev, assuming no new physics
arise. Our slight disagreement for the prediction of sin2 θw and for the low value
of the unification scale seems to imply that the spectrum of the standard model
must be modified either at low-energy or at an intermediate scale. There is also
the possibility that by formulating the theory at very high energies, the concept
of space-time as a manifold breaks down and the noncommutativity of the algebra
must be extended to include the manifold part. One expects that the algebra A
becomes a finite dimensional algebra. Finally, we hope that our universal action
formula should be applicable to many situations of which the most important could
be superconformal field theory. Work along these ideas is now in progress.
