(Dated: December 25, 2025)
We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular
tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this
model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to
probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory
and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundaryboundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the
Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are
able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the
entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a onedimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits
a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure
Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.

INTRODUCTION

Gravitational theories are conjectured to be holographic
in nature; that is the gravitational degrees of freedom
associated with some region of spacetime can be represented by quantum fields residing on the boundary of that
region [1, 2]. In the case of an anti-de Sitter spacetime,
the aysymptotic boundary is flat, and the boundary degrees of freedom are encoded in a conformal field theory
[3]. This holographic correspondence typically maps a
weakly coupled bulk gravitational theory to a strongly
coupled boundary theory. This motivates one to try
to study such theories using non-perturbative methods.
Since Monte Carlo methods cannot be used for these systems because of sign problems one is led to investigate
numerical methods that can be used in a Hamiltonian formulation. In principle, such calculations could be done
using quantum computers, but this is not feasible with
current hardware and algorithms. In (1+1) dimensions,
classical tensor network methods provide extremely efficient alternatives [4, 5]. However, it is generally thought
that such methods will not be effective when they are
lifted to (2+1) dimensional systems [5] due to the need for
very large bond dimensions. In this paper we will show
that the constant ratio of bulk to boundary sites, which
is typical of hyperbolic lattices, allows us to use MPS
methods reliably in system sizes larger than a regular 2d

square lattice. In fact these methods can be adapted to
study such systems with as many as a few hundred lattice
sites.
Specifically, we have used methods based on Matrix
Product States (MPS) to study the ground state and time
evolution of the quantum Ising model formulated on a
discretization of two-dimensional hyperbolic space, which
we can think of as a spatial slice of three-dimensional
anti-de Sitter space. We investigate the phase structure
of this theory and the properties of the associated boundary theory which is gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees
of freedom. It should be noted from the outset that since
the bulk tessellation is fixed the construction does not
include any gravitational fluctuations, so any effective
boundary theory likely does not contain a local energymomentum tensor. Nevertheless, the model can be seen
as a step along the path toward the construction of a
true discrete holographic model that can be explored using future quantum computers.
Using tensor networks or quantum circuits to simulate
holographic physics is not a new idea, and there have
been a great number of earlier studies on related topics.
The most well-known is the Multi-Scale Renormalization
Ansatz (MERA)[6], which uses a set of disentangling matrices to remove local entanglement between sites thereby
achieving the entanglement scaling expected for gapless theories. In addition there have been a plethora of
works where tensor networks have been implemented using hyperbolic tessellations [7–11], in addition to tessellations of superconducting qubits[12, 13] and circuit implementations of hyperbolic tessellations[14, 15]. It has
been shown that Matchgate Tensor network calculations,
which can be related to disordered Ising models, capture

holographic expectations very well[16, 17].
Our work, in contrast, starts with a disorder-free mixed
field Ising model and uses a matrix product state (MPS)
ansatz to capture the wavefunction of low-lying states.
To obtain the ground state of this system, we use the
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm [18]. In addition to this, we also study the dynamical properties of this model by representing the Hamiltonian as a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) and implementing time evolution by using the Time Evolving Block
Decimation (TEBD) algorithm [19]. Using TEBD we calculate Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators (OTOCs)[20–
25] and investigate quantum chaos and information propagation in this system.
Our goal in this paper is to see how far we can push
simple tensor network methods like TEBD and DMRG
to study holographic physics and where these approaches
break down, signaling the need for better algorithms or
the use of quantum algorithms.

where X, Y, Z represent standard Pauli matrices
σ x , σ y , σ z respectively and {j, k} are lattice site indices.
Jzz is the nearest neighbor coupling applied on sites that
are connected on the tessellation, and Jx is the transverse
coupling. We add a small mass m to break the model’s
Z2 symmetry which is required to lift the degeneracy in
the ground state of the system.
We study this model using Hamiltonian-based, quantuminspired tensor networks - Matrix Product States (MPS) -

which give an approximate representation of the quantum
state of a many-body system. As is well known, the MPS
ansatz is inherently a one-dimensional construction, but
it is possible to generalize the method by building an
MPS that snakes through a two-dimensional lattice. This
approach performs well for simulating strip geometries,
but it is limited due to the scaling of the entanglement
entropy in the extra dimension, which requires very large
bond dimensions as the extra dimension size grows larger.
Our objective in this work is to find out if this approach
can be used to simulate models defined on hyperbolic tessellations, in which a large proportion of spins live on the
boundary of the lattice, which limits the amount of long
range interaction needed to capture the 2d dynamics.
The ground state of the model is found using the Density
Matrix Renormalization (DMRG) method. The DMRG
algorithm provides an efficient and systematically improvable framework for simulating strongly correlated
quantum many-body systems in one spatial dimension
[4, 5]. Within this framework, DMRG operates as a variational optimization algorithm over the MPS manifold, delivering ground states and low-lying excitations with controllable accuracy as the bond dimension χbond increases.
Importantly, for high-energy and lattice gauge theory applications, MPS-based approaches can explicitly incorporate gauge symmetries into the local tensor structure,
thereby enabling ab initio Hamiltonian simulations of
confinement, string breaking, and non-equilibrium dynamics without suffering from sign problems. This makes
tensor networks a powerful complementary tool to Monte
Carlo methods, offering a controlled and versatile route
to explore regimes of lattice field theories that are otherwise inaccessible. [18, 19, 26–29]
Time evolution is implemented via the Time Evolving
Block Decimation (TEBD) algorithm. Other time evolution algorithms like Time Dependent Variational principle (TDVP)[30] could also be useful for this setup, which

we plan to explore in future work. Before we move on
to the details of the hyperbolic construction let’s review
the basics of MPS/MPO methods. In general any quantum state can be expanded on the tensor product of the
Hilbert spaces associated with the quantum spins on each
lattice site

After contraction, this returns an MPS with a higher
bond dimension but of the same form. Using these two
building blocks, we can then obtain the ground state
of a quantum system represented by an MPS using the
DMRG algorithm, which uses a variational method on
the matrix parameters to find an approximation to the
ground state. To capture dynamics one can represent
the time evolution operator as an MPO and implement
discrete Trotter time evolution of the MPS.
In our model, we start from a tessellation of twodimensional hyperbolic space H 2 and obtain a onedimensional MPS chain by winding out from the center of
the tessellation along successive layers until the boundary is reached. The order of the matrices in the MPS
ansatz follows the order of the sites as shown in Fig. 1
for a (3, 7) triangulated lattice consisting of 29 vertices
(3-layers) where the edges represent the 2 body interactions and spins are located at the vertices. Grey edges
represent the original MPS description and the red edges
represent the long-range interactions needed to capture
the 2d characteristics.

RESULTS

In this section we show results obtained using the DMRG
algorithm implemented within the ITensor module [31].

A.

The size of χbond controls the amount of entanglement
that can be faithfully captured in the approximation.
This construction is particularly well-suited for systems
whose low-energy states satisfy an area law, such as those
encountered in spin chains and gauge theories discretized
on one-dimensional spatial lattices. To describe operators we use a Matrix Product Operator(MPO) description, which can be given as,

Bulk properties

As a sanity check of our implementation of 2d MPS
method, we first simulate the flat two-dimensional Ising
model on a square lattice, whose bulk phase transition
can be captured by the magnetic susceptibility given by

MPOs provide a natural representation for local Hamiltonians, which we use in our DMRG and TEBD studies.

This is shown in Fig. 2. The observed critical point at
Jzz /Jx ∼ 0.33 is in good agreement with the value obtained by previous tensor network studies in two dimensions [32] confirming that our implementation can capture 2d physics.

Now that we have some confidence that our implementation works for a square lattice, let’s first check the convergence of the ground state energy as a function of bond dimension for the case of a hyperbolic lattice. Fig. 3 shows
the ground state energy obtained using the DMRG algorithm as we increase the bond-dimension χbond at coupling Jzz /Jx = 0.31 for a three-layer tessellation. We
see that the ground state energy converges quickly with
increasing bond dimension and levels off at bond dimensions higher than 400. Similar to the flat case to capture
the phase transition, we investigate the magnetic susceptibility. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we plot the magnetic susceptibility and magnetization, respectively, as a function
of coupling for the hyperbolic lattice model of five-layer
tessellation. Right of this transition point, we have the
disordered phase, and to the left of it we have the ordered
phase.

source and sink.
This has been studied before using classical simulations
of scalars and Ising spins in hyperbolic space [33, 34]. In
particular, one expects the correlator to be determined
by the minimal length lattice path between source and
sink, which, for the hyperbolic space, runs through the
bulk. Because of the structure of the tessellation, this

Notice that the power approaches a minimum as the bulk

minimal path length scales only logarithmically with the
boundary separation. This in turn, has the effect of producing a power law dependence on boundary distance
even for a theory that is gapped in the bulk.
To analyze the correlators, we first fold the data about
r = (Nb − 1)/2 points and then use the data smoothing
procedure as explained in [35] with a smoothing window
of three lattice spacings. Then we fit a power law function
f (r) = Ar−B + D to this folded and smoothed data.

three and four layer lattice. Fig. 8 shows how the power
obtained from these fits varies as a function of the bulk

Out of time ordered correlators(OTOCs)

where, lattice site i is the source point and j is the sink.
We obtain the time evolved operators Zi (t) by expressing
the Hamiltonian as an MPO and implementing Heisenberg evolution via the time-evolving block decimation
(TEBD) algorithm. The system’s state is represented as
an MPS, and time evolution under the Hamiltonian H
is implemented using a Trotter–Suzuki decomposition of
the evolution operator e−iHt into a sequence of two-site
unitary gates. After each local gate application, singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to truncate small
Schmidt coefficients, keeping the MPS within a fixed
bond dimension [5, 36–38].
These time-dependent correlators probe how the information in an initial local quantum state spreads throughout the system as a result of the dynamics. Generically,

6

Our results for the time dependence of OTOCs initialized
at both the center and a boundary site are given in Fig. 9
and Fig. 10, respectively. The generic form of these corresponds to a rapid rise and then an oscillating approach
to an equilibrium plateau. From the initial rapid exponential growth in these OTOCs, we extract Lyapunov
exponents characterizing the chaotic nature of the dynamics. One example of such a fit is given in Fig. 11
It is also useful to construct heatmap plots that show the
magnitude of the OTOC as a function of position for several successive times. These are shown in Fig. 12(a,b,c)
at three different time-slices for an initial source at the
center site and Fig. 12(d,e,f) when the source is at the
first boundary site. The sources are diamond shaped and
colored in red. In both cases we observe the spreading of
the quantum state as a function of time in agreement with
expectations. Notice in the case of the center source, the
signal spreads in a way that is approximately consistent
with the symmetries of the lattice.
In the case where the source is placed on the boundary,
we see that information propagates towards the bulk first
and not along the boundary, this is consistent with the
geodesics in hyperbolic spaces, where the shortest path
between two boundary sites is not on the boundary but
goes through the bulk. However, our MPS ansatz does
not exhibit exact rotational symmetry, and this is reflected in the heatmap plots, Fig. 12

local quantum information is scrambled into non-local
degrees of freedom under time evolution. It is closely
related to the problem of thermalization in quantum systems and to the presence of chaotic dynamics. In the latter case quantum information spreads exponentially fast
through a system and allows one to define a Lyapunov
exponent from the behavior of the OTOC in a manner
similar to a classical chaotic system. Holographic systems corresponding to black holes are thought to furnish
examples of so-called fast scramblers, and so it is interesting to look for such behavior in our toy holographic
model.

Sub-region entropies

In this subsection, we will study the scaling of the entanglement entropy Sℓ = −Tr [ρ(ℓ) log (ρ(ℓ))] with respect
to the subsystem size ℓ. In general, to calculate the entanglement entropy, the system with L spins is divided
into two subsystems A and B of size ℓ and L − ℓ respectively and the resultant density matrix is defined by

full system and then tracing over the bulk indices. This
requires partial traces over the full density matrix of the
spins on the hyperbolic graph. To do this, we make use
of the routines provided in the ITensorEntropyTools.jl
module [39].

where ρ(ℓ) denotes the eigenvalues of the reduced density
matrix.

Once the reduced density matrix corresponding to the
boundary is obtained, we divide the boundary into two
regions to investigate the scaling of the Von-Neumann
Entropy of the boundary theory with respect to the subsystem size.

Initially, let us focus just on the effective boundary theory
which can be obtained by constructing the density matrix
from the MPS corresponding to the ground state of the

tained by a simple least squares procedure) is consistent
with unity, which might be expected if the boundary CFT
at the bulk critical point corresponded to a free Dirac
fermion. Away from the critical point and deeper in the
disordered phase, we see a linear behavior (see Fig. 14).
From our boundary correlator results, one would have
expected that the boundary theory would be governed
by a CFT even when the bulk is gapped. However, our
measurement of the entanglement scaling shows no evidence of this, which we interpret as arising from the fact
that one expects the boundary theory to be governed by
a non-local Hamiltonian for a generic value of the bulk
coupling. This shows the drawback of this method in
simulating AdS/CFT physics compared to MERA and
similar constructions, where a critical boundary theory is
built iteratively, and a logarithm is observed for all couplings. It is possible that the desired logarithmic scaling
will show up at bigger volumes with much larger bond dimension, but with our current computational resources,
we see no evidence of this.
We can also compute the entanglement entropy for the
full system by progressively tracing out subregions starting from the central node. In this case, we find that
the entropy peaks when the subregion reaches the first
boundary node and then decreases. This is true both
at criticality and away from it in the disordered phase.
Fig. 15 shows these findings for a four-layer lattice, respectively. This kind of behavior is known as volume law
scaling and is expected to appear in highly connected
and chaotic systems [40]. Interestingly, MPS methods
that normally exhibit area law scaling capture this volume law scaling behavior when overlaid on a hyperbolic
tessellation, which shows us that even though our description fails to capture the criticality of the boundary
theory accurately, it still manages to capture the bulk

In this work we have shown that using the matrix product state ansatz and a variety of standard tensor network
algorithms, one can study simple Hamiltonian theories
residing on tessellations of hyperbolic space. In the continuum limit, this enables us to probe quantum field theories on three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In practice, we have studied the quantum Ising model as the
simplest system in this class and have restricted our calculations to systems with no more than 232 spins. Notice
that this is still vastly larger than what could be achieved
using exact diagonalization.
One can think of this lattice system as a simple discrete
model for understanding certain aspects of holography.
To this end, we have computed spatial boundary correlation functions at fixed time and for different values
of the bulk coupling, finding a power law behavior for
any value of the bulk coupling in the disordered phase,
as one expects on the basis of the (discrete) symmetries
of hyperbolic space. Indeed our results suggest that the
boundary theory corresponds to a free fermion CFT when
the bulk is tuned to criticality.
Our computations of the boundary entanglement entropy
however, show that the logarithmic dependence on subregion size expected for a true CFT is only realized at
the bulk critical point - away from this coupling, a linear scaling is seen. We attribute this to the fact that
the effective CFT gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees
of freedom is generically non-local unless we tune to the
bulk critical point.
We have also examined out-of-time-ordered (OTOC) correlators for both bulk and boundary spins. We are able
to fit the short-time behavior to an exponential function
and extract a corresponding Lyapunov exponent. There
seems to be some evidence of scrambling.
In general our measurements of dynamics highlight some
of the problems associated with the MPS ansatz - we see a
lack of rotational invariance in the heatmaps that showcase time evolution. In addition, the tensor approach
appears to be limited to modest system sizes of just a
few hundred degrees of freedom. To simulate larger systems we will need to employ better classical algorithms
or quantum computers.
