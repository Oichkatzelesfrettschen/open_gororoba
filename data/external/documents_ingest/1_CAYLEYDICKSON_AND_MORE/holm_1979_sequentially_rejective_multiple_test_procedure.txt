A Simple Sequentially Rejective Multiple Test Procedure
STURE HOLM
Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg
Received December 1977, revised September1978

ABSTRACT. This paper presents a simple and widely applicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective
type, i.e. hypothesesare rejected one at a tine until no further
rejectionscan be done. It is shownthat the test has a prescribed
level of significance protection against error of the first kind
for any combinationof true hypotheses. The power properties
of the test and a number of possible applications are also
discussed.
Key words:multiple test, simultaneous test

The methodologicalmotivationand exact definition
is the following.
Let the (detail)hypothesesin a multipletest problem be denoted by H1, H12,..., Hn and the alternatives
to those by K., K2, ..., K,. A (non-randomized) mul-

tiple test procedureis a rule assigningto each outcome a set of rejectedhypotheses(which might be
empty). This means that there are also n critical
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn consisting of those outcomes

1. Introduction

The statisticalproblemsarisingin applicationsoften
involve a numberof detail problems,i.e. there are
often a numberof interestingparametersto be estimated and/or a numberof interestinghypothesesto
be tested. In some cases these detail problemsmay
be treatedseparatelywithoutany connectionto each
other.But in most cases the detailproblemsare connected to each other and the totality of solutions to
the detailproblemsare used to get a generalpicture.
In this latter case the statisticianis faced with a
multiplestatisticalinferenceproblem,where he has
to take into considerationthat the differentdetail
problemsshould be treatedsimultaneously.
Multiple statisticalinferencehas been a vital research area within statistical inference theory the
past 50 years, and methodshave been proposedfor
severalsituationsof practicalinterest.A good presentation of the earliermain results is given by Miller
(1966).The multiplestatisticalinferencemethodsare
separatedinto two main types, multipleconfidence
intervalmethodsand multipletest methods.
For multipletest proceduresthere has been suggested several types of properties,which the tests
should have in orderto give satisfactoryprotection
againstwrongdecisions.Some of those are basedon
decisiontheoreticconceptions,whileothersare based
on probabilitiesof makingwrong decisions.In this
paperwe will study multipletest proceduresand we
will use the most commontype of protectionagainst
errorof the firstkind by requiringthe tests to have a
small probabilityof rejectingany true hypotheses.

for whichthe correspondinghypothesesare rejected.
In a test of a single null hypothesisH1 againstan
alternativeK1 the size of the test is defined as the
supremumof the probabilityof the criticalregion C1
when the hypothesisH11is true. This probabilityof
errorof the first kind is alwayskept at (or below) a
small predeterminedlevel a. The philosophicalreason for this is that when we have made a 'discovery'
by rejectingthe null hypothesiswe can quite safely
claim that the null hypothesisis not true, becauseif
it was true, we should have accepted it with a
probability of at least 1 -oc. This also implies that

we do not makeany 'discovery'by acceptingthe null
hypotheses,becausewe do not have such a protection againsterrorsof the second kind.
In a multiple test of a number of hypotheses
H,, H12,..., Hn there are a lot of possible combina-

tions of null hypotheses.If we want to make our
'discoveries'in form of rejectednull hypothesesto
be safely claimed, we must keep the probabilityof
rejectingany true null hypothesessmall, how many
and which the true hypothesesmay be. Thus we are
led to the following definition
Definition.A multiple test procedurewith critical
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn for testing hypotheses Hi,
H2, ..., H,, is said to have a multiple level of significance a (for free combinations)if for any non-empty
index set I' {1, 2, 3, ..., n} the supremum of the
probabilityP( u iE C2) when Hi are true for all i eI

is smallerthan or equal to a.
The words 'for free combinations'are put into the
definition in order to underlinethat all subsets of

while the sequentiallyrejectiveBonferroniprocedure
rejectsboth with probability0.565.
The greatadvantagewith the sequentiallyrejective
Bonferronitest (as well as with the classical Bonferronitest) is its flexibility.Thereare no restrictions
on the type of tests, the only requirementbeing that
it should be possible to calculatethe obtainedlevel
for each separatetest. Furtherthereare no problems
in includingin the analysisonly the a priori interesting hypotheses, while more special multiple tests
usuallyincludeall hypothesesof a certainkind. But
when there exist logical implications among the

falsenessof the differenthypothesesis not possible,
and the naturalconditionis of coursethat we should
not end up the multipletest with a statementthat the
true parameterpoint is in an emptyset. Each type of
logical implicationrequiresa special analysis of the
propertiesof the test statisticsin orderto ensurethat
the test can not end up with such statements.The
only type of logical implicationwe will consider is
the one arising in connection with two-sided rejections.

If there are a numberof pairs of one-sidedhypotheses and no logical implicationsbesidethose within the pairsall illogicalstatementswill still be avoided
if the same statistics with opposite signs are used

coherentand consonant.
3. Applicationsand extensions

The sequentiallyrejectiveBonferronitest can be applied in all situationswherethe classicalBonferroni
test is usually applied. And it ought to replace the
classical Bonferroni test in these cases because it
gives only slightly more complicatedcomputations
and a non-negligableincrease of power. It should
howeverbe noted that the sequentiallyrejectiveBonferronitest can not be used to constructsmallerconfidence sets than those constructedby the classical
Bonferronitest. This is so because the confidence
set consists of the parameterpoints that would not
be rejectedas trueparameterpointsin separatesingle
tests. And when a confidenceset is constructedfrom
multipletests it consists of the parameterpoints for
which none of the detail hypotheses are rejected,
whichis in fact a specialconstructionof a singletest
from a multipletest. If the sequentiallyrejectiveBontheses in a multiple test problem. Then C a,l n C co2=

In the analysisof contingencytables the distributional problemsconnectedwith the constructionof
simultaneoustests are so big that the only possibility
in practiceis to use the Bonferronitechnique.See
e.g. Haberman(1974)chapterfour. In such casesthe
power would be higher if the sequentiallyrejective
Bonferronitest was used insteadof a classicalBonferroni test. Other fields where big computational

In all thesecasesas well as in othersit may happen
that some hypothesesare more importantthan the
others, which may imply the use of higherlevels of
significancefor the most importanthypothesesand
smallerlevels of significancefor the less important
hypotheses when the Bonferroni technique is applied. At a first glance it seems to be impossibleto

The previous discussionindicatesa good way of

direct the power towardsthe most importanthypotheses by choosing properconstantsin a generalized

also a desireto havethe differenttest statisticsexactly
