We introduce a coarse-graining transformation for tensor networks that can be applied to study
both the partition function of a classical statistical system and the Euclidean path integral of a
quantum many-body system. The scheme is based upon the insertion of optimized unitary and
isometric tensors (disentanglers and isometries) into the tensor network and has, as its key feature,
the ability to remove short-range entanglement/correlations at each coarse-graining step. Removal
of short-range entanglement results in scale invariance being explicitly recovered at criticality. In this
way we obtain a proper renormalization group flow (in the space of tensors), one that in particular
(i) is computationally sustainable, even for critical systems, and (ii) has the correct structure of
fixed points, both at criticality and away from it. We demonstrate the proposed approach in the
context of the 2D classical Ising model.

Understanding emergent phenomena in many-body
systems remains one of the major challenges of modern physics. With sufficient knowledge of the microscopic degrees of freedom and their interactions, we
can write the partition function of a classical system,
namely a weighted sum of all its microscopic configurations; or the analogous Euclidean path integral of a quantum many-body system, where the weighted sum is now
over all conceivable trajectories. These objects contain
complete information on the collective properties of the
many-body system. However, evaluating partition functions or Euclidean path integrals is generically very hard.
Kadanoff’s spin-blocking procedure [1] opened the path
to non-perturbative approaches based on coarse-graining
a lattice [2, 3]. More recently, Levin and Nave proposed
the tensor renormalization group (TRG) [4], a versatile
real-space coarse-graining transformations for 2D classical partition functions —or, equivalently, Euclidean path
integrals of 1D quantum systems.
TRG is an extremely useful approach that has revolutionized how we coarse-grain lattice models [4–10]. However, this method fails to remove part of the short-range
correlations in the partition function and, as a result,
the coarse-grained system still contains irrelevant microscopic information. Conceptually, this is in conflict with
the very spirit of the renormalization group (RG) and
results in an RG flow with the wrong structure of noncritical fixed points, as discussed in Ref. [7]. Computationally, the accumulation of short-range correlations
over successive TRG coarse-graining transformation also
has important consequences: as pointed out by Levin
and Nave, it implies the breakdown of TRG at criticality
[4, 11] (although universal information, such as critical
exponents, can still be obtained from finite systems).
An analogous problem, faced earlier in the context of
ground state wave-functions, was resolved with the in-

troduction of entanglement renormalization techniques
[12, 13]. In this Letter we will adapt those techniques to
the coarse-graining of partition functions/Euclidean path
integrals, and will demonstrate that the resulting scheme
generates a proper RG flow, with the correct structure of
critical and non-critical fixed points.
A distinctive feature of our proposal, which we call tensor network renormalization (TNR), is that it removes
short-range correlations from the partition function at
each coarse-graining step. In this way, the effective tensor network description at a given length scale is free from
irrelevant microscopic details belonging to shorter length
scales. The upshot is a computationally sustainable RG
flow in the space of tensors. At criticality, removal of
short-range correlations circumvents TRG’s breakdown,
while scale invariance is explicitly realized in the form of
a critical fixed-point tensor [14]. This allows us to effectively address infinitely large systems, avoiding finite-size
effects. Off-criticality we also obtain the correct structure
of non-critical RG fixed points. In this case, the corresponding fixed-point tensors coincide with those previously obtained by Gu and Wen’s tensor-entanglementfiltering renormalization (TEFR) [7, 15]. For simplicity,
we demonstrate TNR with the statistical partition function of the 2D classical Ising model (equivalently, the Euclidean path integral of the 1D quantum Ising model with
transverse magnetic field), although the key ideas apply
to general two dimensional lattice models and extend to
higher dimensions.
Renormalization group flow in the space of tensors.—
Our starting point, also used in TRG [4–10], is the observation that the partition function Z of a 2D classical
system (for concreteness assumed to be translation invariant on a periodic square lattice) can be re-written as
a 2D tensor network made of N copies of some tensor A

Here each index hosts a χ-level local degree of freedom
(e.g. i = 1, 2, · · · , χ), the tensor components Aijkl are
local weights, and the tensor trace tTr denotes a sum
over configurations of all the indices ijk · · · .
Our goal is to produce an effective tensor A(1) , roughly
accounting for four copies of the original tensor A(0) ≡ A,
such that Z can be approximately expressed as a coarser

Thus, after s̃ ≡ log4 (N ) iterations [assuming N = 4s̃ for
some integer s̃ > 0], the partition function Z becomes
P
(s̃)
the trace of a single tensor A(s̃) , Z ≈ ij Aijij , which
we can finally evaluate [16]. On the other hand, in the
thermodynamic limit N → ∞, we can study the flow in
the space of tensors given by Eq. 2. The fixed-point
tensors of this flow will capture the universal properties
of the phases and phase transitions of the system.
Tensor Network Renormalization.— Our coarsegraining transformation for the partition function Z in
Eq. 1 is based on locally inserting (exact or approximate) resolutions of the identity into the tensor network.
The goal is to reorganize the local degrees of freedom, so
as to be able to identify and remove those that are only
correlated at short distances.
Let us regard each index of the network as hosting a
χ-dimensional complex vector space V ≡ Cχ . We consider two types of insertions, see Fig. 1(c). The first type
is implemented by a pair uu† = I ⊗2 of unitary transformations u, or disentanglers, acting on two neighboring
indices, u : V ⊗ V → V ⊗ V. The disentanglers u will be
used to remove short-range correlations [17]. Notice that
inserting a pair of disentanglers uu† does not change the
partition function Z represented by the tensor network.
The second type of insertion is implemented by a projector vv † (or ww† ), where the isometry v (or w) combines two indices into a single one, v : V → V ⊗ V, with
v † v = I. Since vv † is not the identity but a χ-dimensional
projector acting on the χ2 -dimensional space V ⊗ V, inserting it into the tensor network introduces a truncation
error into the representation of the partition function Z.
This error can be estimated by the norm kδk of the difference operator δ defined in Fig. 1(d). If, somehow, only a
small truncation error kδk is introduced, then the resulting tensor network will still be a good approximation to
the partition function Z.

FIG. 1. (a) As an example, we consider a square lattice
(slanted 45◦ ) of classical spins, where σk ∈ {+1, −1} is an
Ising spin on site k. (b) Graphical representation of a part
of the tensor network, where each circle denotes a tensor A,
for the partition function Z of the classical spin model, see
Eq. 1. Here tensor Aijkl encodes the Boltzmann weights of
the spins {σi , σj , σk , σl } according to the Hamiltonian function H, see Eq. 5. (c) Insertion of a pair of disentanglers
uu† between four tensors, where tensors Ã are obtained from
tensors A through a gauge transformation on their horizontal
indices [18], followed by an insertion of four projectors of the
form vv † (or ww† ). These projectors introduce a truncation
error. (d) Tensor δ, whose norm kδk measures the truncation
error introduced by the isometries v and w. Disentanglers
and isometries are chosen so as to minimize kδk.

Fig. 2 shows graphically the proposed TNR transformation. In step (a), disentanglers and isometries are inserted between blocks of 2×2 tensors A(s) . In step (b) two
types of auxiliary tensors, B (s) and C (s) , are produced
by contracting indices. In step (c) tensors B and C are
split using a singular value decomposition, as it is done in
TRG [19]. Finally, in step (d) the coarse-grained tensor
A(s+1) at scale s + 1 is obtained by further contraction of
indices. The disentanglers and isometries introduced in
step (a) are chosen so as to minimize the truncation error
kδk in Fig. 1(d), using well-established, iterative optimization methods for unitary and isometric tensors [13],
which are further detailed in Ref.[20]. The overall computational cost of computing tensor A(s+1) from tensor
A(s) scales as O(χ7 ), although this cost can be reduced
to O(χ6 ) through introducing controlled approximations
[20].

3
To gain some insight into how TNR operates, let us
consider first an oversimplified scenario where the partition function Z only contains short-range correlations
(technically, this corresponds to a so-called CDL tensor
[21]). If we set the disentanglers to be trivial, u = I ⊗2 ,
then the coarse-graining transformation reduces to TRG
and fails to remove the short-range correlations. However, with a judicious choice of disentanglers u these correlations are removed and an uncorrelated, trivial tensor
Atriv is produced [21, 22]. Therefore the role of disentanglers is to remove short-range correlations. Their action
will be particularly important at criticality, where correlations are present at all length scales.

on the square lattice, where σk ∈ {+1, −1} is an Ising
spin on site k and T denotes the temperature. Recall

TNR over a range of bond dimensions χ. The TRG errors fit
δf ∝ χ−3.02 (the inset displays them using log-log axes), while
TNR errors fit δf ∝ exp(−0.305χ). Extrapolation suggests
that TRG would require bond dimension χ ≈ 750 to match
the accuracy of the χ = 42 TNR result. (b) Spontaneous

that this model has a global Z2 symmetry: it is invariant
under the simultaneous flip σk → −σk of all the spins.
We obtained an exact representation for the tensor A in
Eq. 1 in terms of four Boltzmann weights eσi σj /T ,
Aijkl = e(σi σj +σj σk +σk σl +σl σi )/T ,

tensors B (s) and C (s) and the coarse-grained tensor A(s+1) .

which corresponds to having one tensor A for every two
spins, and a tensor network with a 45 degree tilt with
respect to the spin lattice, see Fig. 1(a,b). We actually built our starting tensor A(0) , with bond dimension
χ = 4, by joining a square block of four tensors A together. We then applied up to 18 TNR transformations
to a system made of N = 218 × 218 tensors A(0) , or equivalently 2 × 4 × N Ising spins.
Fig. 3(a) shows the relative error δf in the free energy per site f ≡ log(Z)/(8N
), at the critical temper√
ature Tc ≡ 2/ ln(1 + 2) ≈ 2.269, for both TRG and
TNR as a function of the bond dimensions χ [24]. The
TRG error decays polynomially, while the TNR error is
reduced exponentially, showing a qualitatively different
behaviour and implying that significantly more accurate
results can be obtained with TNR. Figure 3(b) shows the
spontaneous magnetization M (T ) as a function of temperature T obtained with TNR for χ = 6. Even close
to T = Tc , we see remarkable agreement with the exact
solution.
However, the most significant feature of TNR is revealed in Fig. 4, which shows, as a function of the scale

4
T = 1.1 Tc . Now TNR generates a flow towards the trivial fixed-point tensor Atriv , characterized by just one nonzero singular value, which represents the infinite temperature, disordered phase. As expected of a proper RG
scheme, for any T > Tc the flow is to the same trivial
fixed-point tensor Atriv . In contrast, for any T > Tc ,
TRG generates a flows to a fixed-point tensor that depends on the initial temperature T . In other words, failure to remove some of the short-range correlations implies
that (RG irrelevant) microscopic information has been
retained during coarse-graining, contrary to the spirit of
the RG flow. For T < Tc (not shown) we obtain a similar
picture as for T > Tc . However, now each eigenvalue in
the spectrum has degeneracy 2, and TNR flows to a new
fixed-point tensor AZ2 ≡ Atriv ⊕ Atriv corresponding to
the Z2 symmetry breaking, ordered phase —the Z2 spin
flip symmetry acts on AZ2 by exchanging its two copies of
Atriv . Finally, Fig. 4(c) uses the entropy of the spectrum
as a function of scale to visualize the RG flow towards
one of the three fixed-point tensors: the ordered AZ2 for
T < Tc , the critical Acrit for T = Tc , and the disordered
Atriv for T > Tc .

s, the spectrum of singular values of tensor A(s) when
regarded as a matrix [A(s) ](ij)(kl) . Fig. 4(a) considers
the critical point, T = Tc , and shows that under TNR,
the spectrum of A(s) quickly becomes independent of the
scale s. This has two major implications. On the one
hand, it is a strong evidence that A(s) itself has converged
to a fixed-point tensor Acrit (up to small corrections, see
[26] for detials), thus recovering the characteristic scale
invariance expected at criticality. On the other hand, it
implies that the bond dimension χ required to maintain
a fixed, small truncation error kδk is essentially independent of scale, and thus so is also the computational cost.
That is, we have obtained a computationally sustainable
RG transformation. In sharp contrast, the spectrum generated by TRG develops a growing number of large singular values as we increase the scale s, indicating that
the tensor is not scale invariant. The bond dimension
(and thus the computational cost at constant truncation
error) grows rapidly with scale. This growth is caused by
the accumulation of short-range correlations at each iteration and pinpoints the breakdown of TRG at a critical
point [27].
Fig. 4(b) considers a slightly larger temperature,

Outlook.— We have proposed tensor network renormalization (TNR), a coarse-graining transformation for
tensor networks that produces a proper RG flow in the
space of tensors, and demonstrated its performance for
2D classical partition functions –including the explicit
recovery of scale invariance at the critical point. When
applied to the Euclidean path integral of the 1D quantum
Ising model (after suitable discretization in the imaginary time direction), it produced results similar to the
ones described above. The approach can also be used to
compute the norm hΨ|Ψi of a 2D quantum many-body
state encoded in a PEPS [28].
TNR borrows its key idea —the use of disentanglers—
from entanglement renormalization [12, 13], the coarsegraining scheme for many-body wave-functions that led
to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz
(MERA) [29, 30]. The two approaches turn out to be
deeply connected: when applied to the Euclidean path
integral of a Hamiltonian H, TNR produces a MERA for
the ground and thermal states of H [31].

[11] As originally described by Levin and Nave in Ref. [4], the
breakdown of TRG at criticality refers to the fact that
(1) the computational cost to obtain a fixed accuracy in
local expectation values increases as a critical point is approached, and (2) while TRG flows to some fixed-point
tensor off-criticality, this is no longer the case at criticality [4]. However, TRG is still useful to study critical
systems, see e.g. Refs. [4, 7, 27].

[13] G. Evenbly, G. Vidal Phys. Rev. B 79, 144108 (2009).
[14] In this work (as in Levin and Nave’s TRG paper [4]) a
fixed-point tensor is a tensor that is (explicitly) invariant
under coarse-graining [26].
[15] TEFR contains an entanglement filtering step designed
to simplify CDL tensors [21] by filtering out their shortrange correlations [7]. The filtering step allows TEFR
to recover the proper structure of non-critical RG fixedpoints –in contrast with TRG[4], where for a given phase
one obtains a continuum of fixed-point CDL tensors that
only differ in short-range correlations. However, TEFR
cannot simplify tensors near a critical point [32].
[16] An arbitrary n-point correlator will then be computed by
first inserting n operators in the tensor network of Eq. 1,
and then conveniently adjusting its coarse-graining.
[17] The role disentanglers play in TNR, where they remove
short-range correlations, is analogous to their role in the
context of entanglement renormalization of ground state
wave-functions, where they remove short-range entanglement [12]. Hence the name.
[18] The gauge transformation is made such that the block
of four A tensors is manifestly invariant with respect to
reflection along the horizontal axis, which is a convenient
choice in order to preserve reflection symmetry in the
network.
[19] One should take into account the local environment, as
described in Ref.[5], when decomposing an auxiliary tensor C (s) , which may otherwise possess a slowly decaying
†

spectrum of singular values that cannot be accurately
truncated.

[21] For details, see Appendix B.
[22] For the specific case of CDL tensors, the filtering step of
TEFR [7] is also capable of eliminating the local correlations [15]. TNR removes short-range correlations both
away from criticality and near or at a critical point.
[23] The spontaneous magnetization is extracted from the
coarse-grained spin operator, by analysing the projection
onto e.g. the spin-up symmetry-breaking sector.
[24] The bond dimension χ of the TNR calculation denotes
the largest bond dimension used. In practice, different
bond dimensions are used at different steps of the TNR
coarse-graining transformation.
[25] We define a single RG step as that which maps the square
lattice back into a square lattice with the same orientation, but whose linear dimension has been reduced by a
factor of 2. Note that this corresponds to two RG steps
as originally proposed in [4].

Appendix A.– RG flow in the space of tensors: the
2D classical Ising model.

In this appendix we provide additional details on the
flow that TNR generates when applied to a tensor network representation of the partition function of the 2D
classical Ising model on a square lattice, as defined in the
main text.
For all possible values of the temperature T in the Ising
model, the flow is seen to always end in one of three possible fixed-point tensors: the ordered AZ2 for T < Tc ,
the critical Acrit for T = Tc , and the disordered Atriv for
T > Tc . The ordered and disorder fixed-point tensors
can be expressed exactly with a finite bond dimension,
namely χ = 2 and χ = 1, respectively, whereas an exact
expression of the critical fixed-point tensor Acrit is suspected to require an infinite bond dimension, and thus
here we can only obtain an approximate representation.
We emphasize that the non-critical fixed-point tensors
AZ2 and Atriv are equivalent to those previously obtained
by TEFR [7].
For purposes of clarity, instead of following the flow
of tensors A(s) we will display instead the flow of the
auxiliary tensors B that appear in an intermediate step
of the coarse-graining transformation, see Fig.2 in the
main text, as these tensors have smaller bond dimension
[24], that is less coefficients, and are thus more easily
plotted. However, their behavior under the RG flow is
seen to be essentially equivalent to that of tensors A.
Starting with the partition function Z of the 2D classical Ising model at a temperature T , we coarse grain
the corresponding tensor network iteratively using TNR.
This generates a sequence of tensors B (s) , for multiple
RG steps s = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Let [B (s) ]ijkl denote the components of B (s) . Here we consider the case where each
index (i, j, k, and l) has dimension 4. The elements of
these tensors, reshaped as 16 × 16 matrices [B (s) ](ij)(kl)
and then normalized such that their singular values sum
to unity, are plotted in Fig. 5.
Below the critical temperature, T = 0.9 TC , we obtain
a flow towards a fixed-point tensor B Z2 that has two
significant elements [B Z2 ]1111 = [B Z2 ]2222 = 0.5, with
all other elements zero or arbitrarily small, corresponding to the (Z2 -)symmetry-breaking phase. At criticality, T = TC , the tensors converge to a highly non-trivial
fixed point tensor after a small number of RG steps, one
which appears only slightly changed from the first tensor B (0) . Note that, due to the truncation error of the
TNR scheme, we do not obtain a numerically exact fixed
point; nonetheless the individual elements of B (2) and
B (3) all differ by less than 10−4 , while the largest elements of these tensors are of order ∼ 0.1. We thus
define B crit ≡ B (3) as the approximate critical fixedpoint tensor. The precision with which scale-invariance

pixels indicate elements of small magnitude and lighter pixels indicate elements with larger magnitude. (a) Starting
at a sub-critical temperature, T = 0.9 TC , the coarsegrained tensors quickly converge to the Z2 fixed-point tensor B Z2 ≡ B triv ⊕ B triv . (b) Starting at the critical temperature, T = TC , the coarse-grained tensors converge to a
non-trivial fixed-point tensor B crit . Notice that the difference
between coarse-grained tensors, |B (s) − B (s+1) |, which is displayed with the same color intensity as the plots of |B (s) |, is
already very small (as compared to the magnitude of the elements in the individual tensors) for s = 1. (c) Starting at the
super-critical temperature, T = 1.1 TC , the coarse-grained
tensors quickly converge to the disordered fixed point B triv ,
that has only one non-zero element.

FIG. 6. The precision with which TNR approximates a scaleinvariant fixed point tensor for the 2D classical Ising model at
critical temperature Tc is examined by comparing the difference between tensors produced by successive TNR iterations
δ (s) ≡ kA(s) − A(s−1) k, where tensors have been normalized
such that kA(s) k = 1. For small s (initial RG steps), the main
limitation to realizing scale-invariance exactly is physical: the
lattice Hamiltonian includes RG irrelevant terms that break
scale-invariance at short-distance scales, but are suppressed
at larger distances. On the other hand, for large s (large
number of RG steps) the main obstruction to scale invariance
is the numerical truncation errors, which can be thought of as
introducing RG relevant terms, effectively throwing us away
from criticality and thus scale invariance. Indeed, use of a
larger bond dimension χ, which reduces truncation errors, allows TNR to not only achieve a more precise approximation
to scale-invariance, but to hold it for more RG steps.

T = 1.1 TC , we obtain a trivial fixed-point tensor B triv.
that has only a single significant element [B triv ]1111 = 1
with all other elements zero or arbitrarily small, which
is representative of the infinite temperature, disordered
phase.

Appendix B.– Non-critical RG fixed points: TRG
versus TNR.

In this appendix we discuss certain aspects of the flow
that TRG and TNR generate in the space of tensors,
which emphasizes one of the main differences between

FIG. 7. (a) CDL tensor ACDL of Eq. 6. (b) Tensor network
made of CDL tensors, which contains correlations only within
each plaquette.

8
the two approaches. Specifically, we describe a class of
non-critical fixed-points of the flow generated by TRG,
namely those represented by corner double line (CDL)
tensors ACDL , and show that TNR coarse-grains such
tensors into a trivial tensor Atriv . We emphasize that
TEFR can also transform a CDL tensor ACDL into a
trivial tensor Atriv [7].
Fig. 7(a) contains a graphical representation
 of a CDL
tensor ACDL , which has components ACDL ijkl given by

ACDL (i1 i2 )(j1 j2 )(k1 k2 )(l1 l2 ) = δi1 j2 δj1 k2 δk1 l2 δl1 i2

(6)

where a double index notation i = (i1 i2 ) has the meaning
i = i1 +η(i2 − 1). Here the double index runs over values i ∈ 1, 2, . . . , η 2 for integer η, whereas each single
index runs over values i1 , i2 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , η}. Notice that
a square network formed from such CDL tensors ACDL
contains only short-ranged correlations; specifically only
degrees of freedom within the same plaquette can be correlated. We now proceed to demonstrate that this network is an exact fixed point of coarse-graining with TRG,
which was already described in [7]. Note that it is possible to generalize this construction (and the derivation
presented below) by replacing each delta in Eq. 6 (e.g.
δi1 j2 ) with a generic η × η matrix (e.g. Mi1 j2 ) that contains microscopic details. For instance, the fixed point
CDL tensors ACDL (T ) obtained with TRG for the offcritical 2D classical Ising model partition function would
contain matrices Mi1 j2 (T ) that depend on the initial temperature T . However, for simplicity, here we will only
consider the case Mi1 j2 = δi1 j2 .
In the first step of TRG the tensor ACDL is factorized
into a pair of three index tensors S,

as depicted in Fig. 8(d). That the network of CDL tensors is a fixed point of TRG indicates that some of the
short-range correlations in the tensor network are preserved during coarse-graining, i.e. that TRG is artificially
promoting short-ranged degrees to a larger length scale.
As a result TRG defines a flow in the space of tensors
which is not consistent with what is expected of a proper
RG flow. Indeed, two tensor networks that only differ
in short-range correlations, as encoded in two different
ACDL and ÃCDL tensors (differing e.g. in the dimension

9
η of each index i1 , i2 , j1 , · · · , or, more generally, on the
matrices Mi1 j2 discussed above) should flow to the same
fixed point, but under TRG they will not.

disentangler u, see also Eq. 12, (b-c) isometries w and v, see
also Eq. 13, for coarse-graining the network of CDL tensors
ACDL , see Eq. 6, using TNR.

We next apply the TNR approach to a network of CDL
tensors, as defined in Eq. 6, demonstrating that this network is mapped to a network of trivial tensors Atriv , with
effective bond dimension χ′ = 1, thus further substantiating our claim that the TNR approach can properly address all short-ranged correlations at each RG step. Fig.
9 depicts the form of disentangler u and isometries v and
w that insert into the network of CDL tensors at the
first step of TNR, as per Fig.2(a), which are defined as
follows. Let us first regard each index of the initial network as hosting a η 2 -dimensional complex vector space
2
V ≡ Cη , and similarly define a η-dimensional complex
vector space Ṽ ≡ Cη . Then the disentangler uijkl we use
is an isometric mapping u : Ṽ ⊗ Ṽ → V ⊗ V, with indices i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , η} and k, l ∈ {1, 2, . . . , η 2 }, that is
defined,
uij(k1 k2 )(l1 l2 ) = √1η δik1 δk2 l2 δjl1 ,

(12)

where we employ the double index notation, k = (k1 , k2 )
and l = (l1 , l2 ). It is easily verified that u is isometric,
u† u = I˜⊗2 , with I˜ as the identity on Ṽ. The isometries
vijk and wijk are mappings v : Ṽ → V ⊗ Ṽ that are
defined,
wij(k1 k2 ) = vij(k1 k2 ) = √1η δik1 δk2 l2 δjl1 ,

(13)

where again use double index notation, k = (k1 , k2 ).
When inserted into the a 2 × 2 block of tensors from
the network of CDL tensors, as depicted in Fig. 1(b),

FIG. 10. A depiction of the key steps of the TNR coarsegraining transformation in the presence of CDL tensors ACDL .
(a) Insertion of disentanglers u and isometries v and w between two pairs of CDL tensors ACDL results in the elimination of the short-range correlations inside the plaquette that
those four tensors form. (b)-(c) As a result, the auxiliary
tensors B and C only propagate part of the short-range correlations, as represented by the existence of two lines. These
tensors are to be compared with the analogous tensor in TRG,
namely A′ in Fig. 8(d) or ACDL in Fig. 7(a), which still contain four lines. (d) As a result, the new tensor A′ , formed
by factoring B according to a left-right partition of indices
and C according to an up-down partition of indices, is the
trivial tensor Atriv , which contains no lines and therefore no
correlations

this choice of unitary u and isometries w and v act as exact resolutions of the identity, see Fig. 10(a). Thus the
first step of the coarse graining with TNR, as depicted
in Fig. 2(a), is also exact. Following the second step of
TNR, Fig. 2(b), one obtains four-index tensors B and C
as depicted in Fig. 10(b-c), which are computed as,
Bijkl = η 4 (δil δjk ),
Cijkl = η −1 (δij δkl ),

(14)

with indices i, j, k, l ∈ {1, 2 . . . η}. The third step of TNR,
see Fig. 2(c), involves factoring the tensors B and C into
a products of three index tensors according to a particular partition of indices: B(il)(jk) and C(ij)(kl) respectively.

10
However, we see from Eq. 14 that the tensors factor trivially across these partitions, which implies that the effective tensor A′ obtained in the final step of the TNR iteration is trivial (i.e. of effective bond dimension χ′ = 1),
see also Fig. 10(d). Thus we have confirmed that the network of CDL tensors, which contained only short ranged
correlations, can be mapped to a trivial fixed point in a
single iteration of TRG, consistent with what is expected
of a proper RG flow.

Appendix C.– Critical systems.

In this appendix we compare the behaviour of TNR
and TRG at criticality. TNR produces a critical fixedpoint tensor. In contrast, as first argued by Levin and
Nave in Ref. [4], TRG does not. Insight into the different behaviour of TRG and TNR is provided by the scaling of an entropy attached to critical tensors, see Fig.
13. As expected, this entropy is independent of scale
in TNR (since TNR produces a critical fixed-point tensor, independent of scale), while it grows roughly linearly
with scale in TRG, where no critical fixed-point tensor is
reached.
We also examine improved versions of TRG based on
computing a so-called environment, such as the second
renormalization group (SRG) [5, 6, 9], and show that
they also fail to produce a critical fixed-point tensor –
the entropy grows linearly as in TRG, see Fig. 15. Finally, we point out that in spite of the fact that Ref.
[7] refers to TEFR critical tensors as fixed-point tensors,
Ref. [7] presents no evidence that TEFR actually produces a fixed-point tensor at criticality.
A critical system is described by a conformal field theory (CFT). We conclude this appendix by reviewing the
computation of scaling dimensions of the CFT by diagonalizing a transfer matrix of the critical partition function. Any method capable of accurately coarse-graining
the partition function can be used to extract accurate estimates of the scaling dimensions, regardless of whether
the method produces a critical fixed-point tensor. Accordingly, Table I shows that TRG, an improved TRG
with environment, and TEFR indeed produce excellent
estimates of the scaling dimensions. Nevertheless, TNR
is seen to produce significantly better estimates.

Critical fixed-point tensor in TNR

As discussed in the main text and in appendix A,
when applied to the partition function of the critical Ising
model, TNR produces a flow {A(0) , A(1) , · · · } in the space
of tensors that quickly converges towards a fixed-point
tensor Acrit . By fixed-point tensor Acrit we mean a tensor that remains the same, component by component,
under further coarse-graining transformations. This is

the case up to small corrections that can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimensions χ (see
appendix A for quantitative details).
Thus, at criticality, TNR explicitly recovers scale invariance, as expected of a proper RG transformation.
This is analogous to the explicit realization of scale invariance in critical quantum lattice models obtained previously with the MERA [29, 30] (and, ultimately, closely
related to it [31]). In addition to making a key conceptual
point, realizing scale invariance explicitly in the MERA
led to a number of practical results. For instance, it led
to identifying a lattice representation of the scaling operators of the theory, and the computation of the scaling
dimensions and operator product expansion coefficients
of the underlying CFT [30]. Moreover, it produced an
extremely compact representation of the wave-function
of a critical system directly in the thermodynamic limit,
avoiding finite size effects. In turn, this resulted in a
new generation of approaches both for homogeneous critical systems [30] and for critical systems with impurities,
boundaries, or interfaces [33]. Finally, the scale-invariant
MERA has become a recurrent toy model as a lattice realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence [34]. We thus
expect that the explicit invariance of Acrit , as realized by
TNR, will be similarly fruitful.

Absence of critical fixed-point tensor in TRG

In their TRG paper [4], Levin and Nave already argued
that TRG should not be expected to produce a fixedpoint tensor at criticality. The reason is that a critical
tensor in TRG should be thought of as effectively representing a one-dimensional quantum critical system with
an amount of entanglement that scales logarithmic in the
system size –that is, linearly in the number of coarsegraining step. Thus at criticality the tensor manifestly
changes each time that the system is coarse-grained. As
a matter of fact, the authors referred to this situation as
the breakdown of TRG at criticality (to account for a linear growth of entropy with the number of coarse-graing
steps, the bond dimension χ must grow exponentially,
and so the computational cost), and related it to the
similar critical breakdown of the density matrix renormalization group [3].
In spite of Levin and Nave’s original argument justifying the breakdown of TRG at criticality, one might
wonder whether there is a local choice of gauge such that
TRG also flows into a fixed-point tensor (up to small numerical errors) [35]. This local gauge freedom (called
field redefinition in [7]), refers to a local change of basis on individual indices of the tensor, implemented by
invertible matrices x and y

under which the partition function Z represented by the
tensor network remains unchanged. That is, one might
wonder if after a proper choice of local gauge, the critical
tensors A(s) and A(s+1) before and after the TRG coarsegraining step s are (approximately) the same. [We notice
that, in order to simplify the comparison with TNR, here
by one TRG coarse-graining step we actually mean two
TRG coarse-graining steps as originally defined in [4],
so that the square lattice is mapped back into a square
lattice with the same orientation].

In order to definitely confirm that indeed TRG does
not produce a critical fixed-point tensor even up to local
gauge transformations, we will study the dependence of
a matrix Γ(s) in the coarse-grainng step s. Matrix Γ(s)
is defined in terms of two tensors A(s) according to Fig.
11(b). Γ(s) itself is not invariant under local gauge transformations, but one can build gauge invariant quantities
out of it. Here we will focus on two such gauge invariant
objects: the spectrum of eigenvalues of Γ(s) , as well as a

For TRG, these entropies grow linearly in the coarse-graining

For TNR, these entropies are essentially constant for s ≥ 3.

The flattening of the spectrum in Fig. 12, as well
as the steady growth of the entropies S and R2 in Fig.
13 constitute an unambiguous confirmation that critical
TRG tensors A(s) and A(s+1) are not equal up to a local
gauge transformation, not even approximately. In addition, these features are robust against increasing the
bond dimension χ, and therefore are not an artifact of
the truncation.

FIG. 14. Relative error in the free energy per site δf as a function of bond dimension χ for the 2D Ising model at criticality, comparing HOTRG, HOSRG and TNR. Through use of
the environment HOSRG is able to give better accuracy than
HOTRG for any given χ, though the accuracy of HOSRG is
still less than that of TNR.

Use of environment

A significant advance in renormalization methods for
tensor networks since the introduction of TRG has been
the use of the so-called environment to achieve a more
accurate truncation step. The improved TRG method
proposed in Ref. [5] under the name of “poor-man’s
SRG” generates local weights that represent the local environment in a small neighborhood in the tensor network,
while the second renormalization group (SRG) proposed
in Ref. [6] takes this idea further by using a global environment that represents the entir tensor network.
Fig. 14 shows that, for the 2D Ising model at criticality, the use of an environment produces a more accurate
numerical estimate of the free energy per site. Specifically, the data corresponds to the higher order tensor
renormalization group (HOTRG) proposed in Ref.[9], an
improvement on TRG based upon the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) but does not take the
environment into account; and to the higher order second renormalization group (HOSRG), which uses both
HOSVD and the global environment. It is also worth
pointing out however that TNR, which in its current
implementation is a purely local update that does not
take into account the environment, produces more accurate results than HOSRG for the same value of the bond
dimension. [Moreover, the cost in TNR scales only as
O(χ6 ), whereas the cost of HOTRG and HOSRG scales
as O(χ7 )].
Based upon the improvement in free energy of HOSRG
compared to HOTRG, one may wonder whether the use
of the environment, as in SRG, could potentially re-

solve the breakdown of TRG at criticality and even produce a critical fixed-point tensor. We have investigated
this question numerically by analyzing the RG flow of
tensors generated by HOTRG and HOSRG for the 2D
Ising model at criticality, as shown in Fig.15. Under
coarse-graining with HOSRG, the spectrum of the critical tensors grows increasingly flat with RG step, in a
similar manner as was observed with standard TRG in
Fig.12. The same occurs for HOTRG (not plotted). Likewise, in both HOTRG and HOSRG, the entropy of tensors is seen to increase roughly linearly with RG step,
and this growth is essentially robust under increasing
the bond dimension. These results clearly demonstrate
that (HO)SRG does not produce a critical fixed-point
tensor. Thus we conclude that the use of environment
in (HO)SRG, while leading to a more accurate coarsegraining transformation for fixed bond dimension over
(HO)TRG, does not prevent the computational breakdown experienced by TRG at criticality. In particular
SRG still fails to produce a proper RG flow and critical
fixed-point tensor.

The TEFR algorithm

Ref. [7] refers to the tensors obtained with TEFR at
criticality as fixed-point tensors. Accordingly, one might
be led to conclude that TEFR actually generates a fixed-

point tensor (and thus recovers scale invariance) at criticality. As demonstrated in Ref. [7], TEFR produces
accurate estimates of the central charge c and scaling dimensions ∆α for the Ising model, and one might indeed
misinterpret those as being evidence for having generated
a critical fixed-point tensor. However, the estimates reported in Ref. [7] for c and ∆α are of comparable accuracy to those obtained with TRG and “poor-man’s
SRG” using the same bond dimension (see Table I in
Sect. C.5). Since the above methods demonstrably fail
to produce a fixed-point tensor, the accurate TEFR estimates provided in Ref. [7] are no evidence that TEFR
has produced a critical fixed-point tensor. In conclusion,
Ref. [7] refers to the TEFR critical tensors as fixed-point
tensors, but Ref. [7] provides no evidence that TEFR
realizes a fixed-point tensor at criticality.

Extraction of scaling dimensions from a transfer
matrix

In proposing TRG in Ref. [4], Levin and Nave refer
to the significant loss of efficiency experienced by the
method at criticality as TRG’s critical break-down. It is
important to emphasize that, in spite of this significant
loss of efficiency at criticality, TRG can still be used to
extract universal information about a phase transition,
by studying the partition function of a finite system.
The key theoretical reason is that in a finite system
one can observe a realization of the so-called operatorstate correspondence in conformal field theories (CFT),
which asserts that there is a one-to-one map between
the states of the theory and its scaling operators [36].
Specifically, the finite size corrections are universal and
controlled by the spectrum of scaling dimensions of the

theory [37]. This is best known in the context of critical
quantum spin chains, where Cardy’s formula relates the
smallest scaling dimensions ∆α of the conformal theory
to the lowest eigenvalues Eα of the critical Hamiltonian
on a periodic chain according to
2π
∆α + · · · ,
(18)
L
where L is the number of spins on the chain, Eα (∞)
is the energy in an infinite system, η (independent of
α) depends on the normalization of the Hamiltonian,
and where the sub-leading non-universal corrections are
O(1/L2 ) in the absence of marginal operators. Thus, we
can estimate scaling dimensions ∆α by diagonalizing a
critical Hamiltonian on a finite periodic chain, as it is
often done using exact diagonalization techniques. In a
two dimensional statistical system, the analogous result
is the observation that even in a finite system, a critical
partition function Z is organized according to the scaling
dimensions of the theory as
X
2π
c
Z = eaLx Ly
e−Ly Lx (∆α − 12 )+··· ) ,
(19)

where a is some non-universal constant, c is the central
charge of the CFT, and we assumed isotropic couplings
and a square torus made of Lx × Ly sites.

FIG. 16. Calculation of the smallest non-zero scaling dimension of 2D classical Ising at criticality, computed using either
TRG or TNR through diagonalization of the transfer operator
on an effective linear system size of L spins, comparing to the
exact result ∆σ = 1/8. For small system sizes, L < 26 spins,
finite size effects limit the precision with which ∆σ can be
computed, while for large system sizes truncation errors reduce the accuracy of the computed value of ∆σ . However, it
is seen that the TNR approach maintains accuracy for much
larger system sizes than does TRG: while TRG with bond
dimension χ = 80 gives ∆σ within 1% accuracy up to linear system size L = 211 spins, a TNR with bond dimension
χ = 24, which required a similar computation time as the
χ = 80 TRG result, gives 1% accuracy up to L = 224 spins.

As proposed by Gu and Wen [7], if the coarse-grained
tensor A(s) effectively represents the whole partition

14
function of a system made of 2s × 2s sites (and thus
Lx = Ly = 2s ), then we can extract the central charge
c and scaling dimensions ∆α from it by e.g. computing
the spectrum of eigenvalues of the matrix M (s) (see Fig.
11(a)),

Indeed, after removing the non-universal constant a in

the largest eigenvalues λα of M (s) are of the form [7]

(21)

For instance, Table I shows remarkably accurate estimates of the central charge c and lowest scaling dimensions ∆α obtained by using TRG and other related
methods on a finite lattice made of 1024 spins. These results are a strong indication that TRG accurately coarsegrains the partition function of such a finite system. [The
table also shows more accurate results obtained with
TNR on larger systems using a smaller bond dimension.]
In Fig. 16 we examine the accuracy with which TRG
and TNR reproduce the dominant scaling dimension of
the Ising model, ∆σ = 1/8, on finite lattices of different linear size L. Here it can be seen that TRG results
quickly lose accuracy for larger system sizes, a manifestation of the breakdown of TRG at criticality, whilst the
results from TNR maintain a high level of accuracy even
for very large systems. For instance in comparing the

χ = 80 TRG result to the χ = 24 TNR results, which
both required a roughly equivalent computation time to
run on a laptop computer (∼ 3 hours), the TRG calculation gave ∆σ to with 1% accuracy for spins systems
with linear dimension large as L = 211 , while the TNR
calculation the same accuracy for systems with linear dimension large as L = 224 : roughly 4000 times larger
linear dimension than TRG.
In conclusion, TRG is an excellent method to study
critical partition functions on a finite system, provided
that the size of the system that we want to investigate
is small enough that the truncation errors are not yet
significant. In the critical Ising model, sub-leading (nonuniversal) finite size corrections to the dominant (universal) contributions to the partition function (that is,
to the weights e−2π(∆α −c/12) for small ∆α ) happen to be
very small even for relatively small systems. As a result, one can use TRG to extract remarkably accurate
estimates of the central charge c and smallest scaling dimensions ∆α . This calculation is analogous to extracting
scaling dimensions by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a
quantum critical system on a finite ring and then using
Cardy’s formula (Eq. 18).
However, the ability to extract accurate estimates of
the central charge and scaling dimensions after applying
a coarse-graining transformation such as TRG on a finite
system does not imply that one has obtained a critical
fixed-point tensor. Indeed, we have shown above that
TRG does not produce a critical fixed-point tensor, as
had already been anticipated by Levin and Nave [4].
