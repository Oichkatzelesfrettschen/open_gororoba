Abstract
New orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for the Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation is constructed. The map of p–adic
numbers onto real numbers (p–adic change of variable) is considered.
p–Adic change of variable maps the Haar measure on p–adic numbers
onto the Lebesgue measure on the positive semiline. p–Adic change of
variable (for p = 2) provides an equivalence between the constructed
basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator and the wavelet
basis in L2 (R+ ) generated from the Haar wavelet. This means that
the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic spectral analysis.

Introduction

In the present paper we construct a new orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions
of the Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation. The example
of such a basis one can find in [1]. Different basises of eigenvectors of the
Vladimirov operator were built in [2], [3], [4]. The basis constructed in the
present paper consists of locally constant functions with support on p–adic
discs.
We also check that the constructed basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov
operator (for p = 2) is equivalent to the wavelet basis in L2 (R+ ) generated
from the Haar wavelet. This equivalence is given by p–adic change of variables: the map of p–adic numbers onto real numbers that conserves the
measure. This means that the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic
1

harmonic analysis (decomposition of functions over the eigenfunctions of the
Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation).
For introduction to p-adic analysis see [1]. p-Adic analysis and p-adic
mathematical physics attract great interest, see [1], [5], [6]. For instance, padic models in string theory were introduced, see [7], [8], and p-adic quantum
mechanics [9] and p–adic quantum gravity [10] were investigated. p–Adic
analysis was applied to investigate the spontaneous breaking of the replica
symmetry, cf. [11], [12], [13], [14].
Let us make here a brief review of p-adic analysis. The field Qp of p-adic
numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers Q with respect
to the p-adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way. An
arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = pγ m
with m and
n
n not divisible by p. The p-adic norm of the rational number x = pγ m
is
n
equal to |x|p = p−γ .
The most interesting property of the field of p-adic numbers is ultrametricity. This means that Qp obeys the strong triangle inequality
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p , |y|p).
We will consider disks in Qp of the form {x ∈ Qp : |x − x0 |p ≤ p−k }. For
example, the ring Zp of integer p-adic numbers is the disk {x ∈ Qp : |x|p ≤ 1}
which is the completion of integers with the p-adic norm. The main properties
of disks in arbitrary ultrametric space are the following:
1.
Every point of a disk is the center of this disk.
2.
Two disks either do not intersect or one of these disks contains the
other.
The p-adic Fourier transform F of the function f (x) is defined as follows
F [f ](ξ) = fe(ξ) =

Z

χ(ξx)f (x)dµ(x)

Qp

Here dµ(x) is the Haar measure. The inverse Fourier transform have the
form
Z
−1
F [ge](x) =
χ(−ξx)ge(ξ)dµ(ξ)
Qp

Here χ(ξx) = exp(2πiξx) is the character of the field of p-adic numbers. For
example, the Fourier transform of the indicator function Ω(x) of the disk of

2

radius 1 with center in zero (this is a function that equals to 1 on the disk
and to 0 outside the disk) is the function of the same type:
e
Ω(ξ)
= Ω(ξ)

In the present paper we use the following Vladimirov operator Dxα of the
fractional p-adic differentiation, that is defined [1] as
Dxα f (x) = F −1 ◦ |ξ|αp ◦ F [f ](x) =

pα − 1 Z f (x) − f (y)
dµ(y)
1 − p−1−α Qp |x − y|1+α
p

(1)

Here F is the (p-adic) Fourier transform, the second equality holds for α > 0.
For further reading on the subject of p-adic analysis see [1].

p–Adic spectral analysis

Let us construct an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the Vladimirov operator. The following lemma gives the basic technical result.
Lemma 1. The function
ψ(x) = χ(p−1 x)Ω (|x|p )

(2)

is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator:
D α ψ(x) = pα ψ(x)

Remark. The eigenvalue for ψ(x) is the same as for the character χ(p−1 x):
D α χ(p−1 x) = pα χ(p−1 x)
Proof
We get

Let us check that ψ(x) is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator.
D α ψ(x) =

pα − 1 Z ψ(x) − ψ(y)
dµ(y) =
1 − p−1−α
|x − y|1+α

(3)

Let us calculate the integral over y in (3) in two cases.
1) Let |x|p ≤ 1. In this case the integral in (3) is given by
Z

1 − χ(p−1 (y − x))Ω (|y|p )
dµ(y)
|x − y|1+α
p

Using that every point of p–adic disk is its center we get that for |x|p ≤ 1 we
have Ω (|y|p) = Ω (|x − y|p ) and therefore the integral is equal to
Z

Z
1 − χ(p−1 (y − x))Ω (|y − x|p )
1 − χ(p−1 z)Ω (|z|p )
dµ(y)
=
dµ(z)
|x − y|1+α
|z|1+α
p
p

2) Let |x|p > 1. For the integral in (3) we get
1
− 1+α
|x|p

Z

|y|p ≤1

χ(p−1 (y − x))dµ(y) = 0

This proves that ψ(x) is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator with
the following eigenvalue
pα − 1
D ψ(x) = ψ(x)
1 − p−1−α

that finishes the proof of the lemma.
The lemma implies
D α ψ(ax + b) = |a|αp pα ψ(ax + b)

(4)

One can check that the set of (integrable) functions ψ(ax + b) (for different
a, b) is a complete system in a Hilbert space L2 (Qp ). Moreover,

Consider γ ≤ γ ′ . We have that the product of indicators is equal to the
indicator or zero:
′

′

Ω(|pγ x − n|p )Ω(|pγ x − n′ |p ) = Ω(|pγ x − n|p )Ω(|pγ −γ n − n′ |p )

Since n′ ∈ Qp /Zp the function Ω(|pγ −γ n − n′ |p ) is non–zero (and equal to
one) for

n′ = pγ −γ n

Therefore the scalar product (7) can be non–zero only for γ = γ ′ . For γ = γ ′
the integral (8) is equal to
Z

Qp

p−γ χ(−pγ−1 jx)χ(pγ−1 j ′ x)Ω(|pγ x − n|p )Ω(|n − n′ |p )dµ(x)

we get for (7)

p−γ χ(pγ−1 (j ′ − j)x)Ω(|pγ x − n|p )dµ(x) =

that proves that the vectors ψγjn are orthonormal.
To prove that the set of vectors {ψγjn } is an orthonormal basis (is total
in L2 (Qp )) we use the Parsevale identity.
Since the set of indicators (characteristic functions) of p–adic discs is
total in L2 (Qp ) and the set of vectors {ψγjn } is translationally invariant and
invariant under dilations x 7→ pn x, x ∈ Qp , to prove that {ψγjn } is a complete
system it is enough to check the Parsevale identity for the indicator Ω(|x|p ).
We have
γ

hΩ(|x|p ), ψγjn i = p− 2 θ(γ)δn0 ,

θ(γ) = 0, γ ≤ 0,

θ(γ) = 1, γ ≥ 1

(9)

Formula (9) implies the Parsevale identity for Ω(|x|p ):

that proves that {ψγjn } is an orthonormal basis in L2 (Qp ).
Formula (4) implies that the basis {ψγjn } is an orhtonormal basis of
eigenvectors of the operator D α with eigenvalues (6). This finishes the proof
of the theorem.

Wavelet interpretation

Let us discuss the connection between the constructed basis {ψγjn } and the
basis of wavelets in the space of quadratically integrable functions L2 (R+ )
on positive semiline. The wavelet basis in L2 (R+ ) is a basis given by shifts
and dilations of the so called mother wavelet function, cf. [15]. The simplest
example of such a function is the Haar wavelet
Ψ(x) = χ[0, 1 ] (x) − χ[ 1 ,1] (x)

(10)

(difference of two characteristic functions).
The wavelet basis in L2 (R) (or basis of multiresolution wavelets) is the
basis

Ψγn (x) = 2− 2 Ψ(2−γ x − n), γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Z

The following map is a one–to–one map:
ρ : Qp /Zp → N
where N is a set of natural numbers including zero.
Here Qp /Zp is a group (with respect to addition modulo 1) of numbers of
the form

ρ : Qp \{pm n + pk Zp } → R+ \{p−m ρ(n) + [0, p−k ]}

up to a finite number of points.

We consider for simplicity the case ρ0 = ρ and k = 0. Consider

Application of (13) for y = n, y = n − 1 proves that n + Zp maps into
ρ(n) + [0, 1]. Since the map Qp /Zp → N is one–to–one this proves the
lemma.
Lemma 5.
The map ρ maps the Haar measure µ on Qp onto the Lebesgue
measure l on R+ : for measurable subspace X ⊂ Qp
µ(X) = l(ρ(X))
or in symbolic notations
ρ : dµ(x) 7→ dx
Proof
Lemma 4 implies that balls in Qp map onto closed intervals in
R+ with conservation of measure. The map ρ : Qp → R+ is surjective and
moreover nonintersecting balls map onto intervals thaat do not intersect or
have intersection of the measure zero (by lemma 4). This proves the lemma.
Therefore the corresponding map
ρ∗ : L2 (R+ ) → L2 (Qp )
ρ∗ f (x) = f (ρ(x))

(16)

is an unitary operator.
Lemma 4 implies the following:
Lemma 6.
(for p = 2):

The map ρ maps the Haar wavelet (10) onto the function (2)
ρ∗ : Ψ(x) 7→ ψ(x)

(17)

(17) is an equality in L2 : on the set of zero measure (17) may not be true.
Moreover, we have the following theorem:
9

Theorem 7. For p = 2 the map ρ maps the orthonormal basis of wavelets
in L2 (R+ ) (11) (generated from the Haar wavelet) onto the basis (5) of
eigenvectors of the Vladimirov operator:

Proof

ρ∗ : Ψγρ(n) (x) 7→ (−1)n ψγ1n (x)

(18)

2−γ ρ(x) = ρ(2γ x)

(19)

We have

Lemma 4 implies for ρ(n) ∈ N
χ[0,1] (ρ(2γ x) − ρ(n)) = χ[0,1] (ρ(2γ x − n))

(20)

(20) is true almost everywhere. Analogously
χ[0, 1 ] (ρ(2γ x) − ρ(n)) = χ[0, 1 ] (ρ(2γ x − n))
2

(21)

Formulas (11), (19), (20), (21) imply
γ

Ψγρ(n) (ρ(x)) = 2− 2 Ψ(2−γ ρ(x) − ρ(n)) =
γ

γ

= 2− 2 Ψ(ρ(2γ x − n)) = 2− 2 ψ(2γ x − n)
The last equality follows from (16).
Formula (5) implies that for p = 2
γ

γ

ψγ1n (x) = 2− 2 χ(2γ−1 x)Ω(|2γ x − n|2 ) = (−1)n 2− 2 ψ(2γ x − n)
that proves (18) and finishes the proof of the theorem.
We get that after the p–adic change of variables (12) the wavelet analysis becomes the p–adic spectral analysis (expansion of a function over the
eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator of p–adic derivation).
Using this interpretation we will call the basis (5) the wavelet basis (or
p–adic wavelet basis).
Using map (16) it is possible to define the action of the Vladimirov operator in L2 (R+ ) by the formula
∂pα f (x) = ρ∗−1 D α ρ∗ f (x)
10

(let us note that D α and ρ∗ depend on p).
Ne can see that
∂pα f (x) =

pα − 1 Z ∞
f (x) − f (y)
dy
1 − p−1−α 0 |ρ−1 (x) − ρ−1 (y)|1+α
p

(22)

where ρ−1 is the inverse map to ρ. Since ρ is not one–to–one map the map
ρ−1 is ambiguous but ambiguity is concentrated on the set of zero measure
that makes definition (22) correct.
