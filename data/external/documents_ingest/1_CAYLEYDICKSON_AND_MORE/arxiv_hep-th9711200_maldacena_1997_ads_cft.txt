                                           We show that the large N limit of certain conformal field theories in various dimen-
                                     sions include in their Hilbert space a sector describing supergravity on the product of
                                     Anti-deSitter spacetimes, spheres and other compact manifolds. This is shown by taking
                                     some branes in the full M/string theory and then taking a low energy limit where the field
                                     theory on the brane decouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still
                                     trust the near horizon geometry for large N . The enhanced supersymmetries of the near
                                     horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the super-
                                     conformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The ’t Hooft limit of 3+1
                                     N = 4 super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB
                                     strings. We conjecture that compactifications of M/string theory on various Anti-deSitter
                                     spacetimes is dual to various conformal field theories. This leads to a new proposal for a
                                     definition of M-theory which could be extended to include five non-compact dimensions.

1. General idea

    In the last few years it has been extremely fruitful to derive quantum field theories by
taking various limits of string or M-theory. In some cases this is done by considering the
theory at geometric singularities and in others by considering a configuration containing
branes and then taking a limit where the dynamics on the brane decouples from the bulk.
In this paper we consider theories that are obtained by decoupling theories on branes from
gravity. We focus on conformal invariant field theories but a similar analysis could be done
for non-conformal field theories. The cases considered include N parallel D3 branes in IIB
string theory and various others. We take the limit where the field theory on the brane
decouples from the bulk. At the same time we look at the near horizon geometry and we
argue that the supergravity solution can be trusted as long as N is large. N is kept fixed
as we take the limit. The approach is similar to that used in [1] to study the NS fivebrane
theory [2] at finite temperature. The supergravity solution typically reduces to p + 2
dimensional Anti-deSitter space (AdSp+2 ) times spheres (for D3 branes we have AdS5 ×S 5 ).
The curvature of the sphere and the AdS space in Planck units is a (positive) power of
1/N . Therefore the solutions can be trusted as long as N is large. Finite temperature
configurations in the decoupled field theory correspond to black hole configurations in
AdS spacetimes. These black holes will Hawking radiate into the AdS spacetime. We
conclude that excitations of the AdS spacetime are included in the Hilbert space of the
corresponding conformal field theories. A theory in AdS spacetime is not completely well
defined since there is a horizon and it is also necessary to give some boundary conditions
at infinity. However, local properties and local processes can be calculated in supergravity
when N is large if the proper energies involved are much bigger than the energy scale
set by the cosmological constant (and smaller than the Planck scale). We will conjecture
that the full quantum M/string-theory on AdS space, plus suitable boundary conditions
is dual to the corresponding brane theory. We are not going to specify the boundary
conditions in AdS, we leave this interesting problem for the future. The AdS×(spheres)
description will become useful for large N , where we can isolate some local processes from
the question of boundary conditions. The supersymmetries of both theories agree, both
are given by the superconformal group. The superconformal group has twice the amount
of supersymmetries of the corresponding super-Poincare group[3,4]. This enhancement of
supersymmetry near the horizon of extremal black holes was observed in [5,6] precisely
by showing that the near throat geometry reduces to AdS×(spheres). AdS spaces (and

                                             1
branes in them) were extensively considered in the literature [7,8,9,10,11,12,13], includding
the connection with the superconformal group.
         In section 2 we study N = 4 d=4 U (N ) super-Yang-Mills as a first example, we discuss
several issues which are present in all other cases. In section 3 we analyze the theories
describing M-theory five-branes and M-theory two-branes. In section 4 we consider theories
with lower supersymmetry which are related to a black string in six dimensions made with
D1 and D5 branes. In section 5 we study theories with even less supersymmetry involving
black strings in five dimensions and finally we mention the theories related to extremal
Reissner-Nordström black holes in four spacetime dimensions (these last cases will be
more speculative and contain some unresolved puzzles). Finally in section 6 we make some
comments on the relation to matrix theory.



2.       D3 branes or N = 4 U (N ) super-Yang-Mills in d=3+1

         We start with type IIB string theory with string coupling g, which will remain fixed.
Consider N parallel D3 branes separated by some distances which we denote by r. For
low energies the theory on the D3 brane decouples from the bulk. It is more convenient to
take the energies fixed and take

                                                           r
                                α′ → 0 ,              U≡      = fixed .                      (2.1)
                                                           α′

The second condition is saying that we keep the mass of the stretched strings fixed. As
we take the decoupling limit we bring the branes together but the the Higgs expectation
values corresponding to this separation remains fixed. The resulting theory on the brane
is four dimensional N = 4 U (N ) SYM. Let us consider the theory at the superconformal
point, where r = 0. The conformal group is SO(2,4). We also have an SO(6) ∼ SU (4)
R-symmetry that rotates the six scalar fields into each other2 . The superconformal group
includes twice the number of supersymmetries of the super-Poincare group: the commu-
tator of special conformal transformations with Poincare supersymmetry generators gives
the new supersymmetry generators. The precise superconformal algebra was computed in
[3]. All this is valid for any N .

     2
         The representation includes objects in the spinor representations, so we should be talking
about SU(4), we will not make this, or similar distinctions in what follows.

                                                  2
      Now we consider the supergravity solution carrying D3 brane charge [14]

                           ds2 = f −1/2 dx2|| + f 1/2 (dr 2 + r 2 dΩ25 ) ,
                                        4πgN α′2                                         (2.2)
                              f =1+              ,
                                           r4
where x|| denotes the four coordinates along the worldvolume of the three-brane and dΩ25
is the metric on the unit five-sphere3 . The self dual five-form field strength is nonzero and
has a flux on the five-sphere. Now we define the new variable U ≡ αr′ and we rewrite the
metric in terms of U . Then we take the α′ → 0 limit. Notice that U remains fixed. In this
limit we can neglect the 1 in the harmonic function (2.2). The metric becomes

                               U2                 dU 2 p
                                                                     
                   2     ′            2                             2
                                         p
                 ds = α √           dx + 4πgN 2 + 4πgNdΩ5 .                              (2.3)
                              4πgN ||              U

This metric describes five dimensional Anti-deSitter (AdS5 ) times a five-sphere4 . We see
that there is an overall α′ factor. The metric remains constant in α′ units. The radius of
                    2
                              √
the five-sphere is Rsph /α′ = 4πgN, and is the same as the “radius” of AdS5 (as defined
in the appendix). In ten dimensional Planck units they are both proportional to N 1/4 .
The radius is quantized because the flux of the 5-form field strength on the 5 sphere is
quantized. We can trust the supergravity solution when

                                            gN ≫ 1 .                                     (2.4)

When N is large we have approximately ten dimensional flat space in the neighborhood
of any point5 . Note that in the large N limit the flux of the 5 form field strength per unit
Planck (or string) 5-volume becomes small.
      Now consider a near extremal black D3 brane solution in the decoupling limit (2.1).
We keep the energy density on the brane worldvolume theory (µ) fixed. We find the metric

      We choose conventions where g → 1/g under S-duality.

      See the appendix for a brief description of AdS spacetimes.

      In writing (2.4) we assumed that g ≤ 1, if g > 1 then the condition is N/g ≫ 1. In other
words we need large N , not large g.

                                                 3
We see that U0 remains finite when we take the α′ → 0 limit. The situation is similar
to that encountered in [1]. Naively the whole metric is becoming of zero size since we
have a power of α′ in front of the metric, and we might incorrectly conclude that we
should only consider the zero modes of all fields. However, energies that are finite from
the point of view of the gauge theory, lead to proper energies (measured with respect to
proper time) that remain finite is in α′ units (or Planck units, since g is fixed). More
concretely, an excitation that has energy ω (fixed in the limit) from the point of view of
                                                                    1/4
the gauge theory, will have proper energy Eproper = √1α′ ω(gN4π)
                                                             U            . This also means that
the corresponding proper wavelengths remain fixed. In other words, the spacetime action
                                              √
on this background has the form S ∼ α1′4 d10 x GR+· · ·, so we can cancel the factor of α′
                                        R

in the metric and the Newton constant, leaving a theory with a finite Planck length in the
limit. Therefore we should consider fields that propagate on the AdS background. Since
the Hawking temperature is finite, there is a flux of energy from the black hole to the AdS
spacetime. Since N = 4 d=4 U (N ) SYM is a unitary theory we conclude that, for large
N , it includes in its Hilbert space the states of type IIB supergravity on (AdS5 × S5 )N ,
where subscript indicates the fact that the “radii” in Planck units are proportional to
N 1/4 . In particular the theory contains gravitons propagating on (AdS5 × S5 )N . When we
consider supergravity on AdS5 × S5 , we are faced with global issues like the presence of a
horizon and the boundary conditions at infinity. It is interesting to note that the solution
is nonsingular [15]. The gauge theory should provide us with a specific choice of boundary
conditions. It would be interesting to determine them.
    We have started with a quantum theory and we have seen that it includes gravity so it
is natural to think that this correspondence goes beyond the supergravity approximation.
We are led to the conjecture that Type IIB string theory on (AdS5 × S 5 )N plus some
appropriate boundary conditions (and possibly also some boundary degrees of freedom) is
dual to N =4 d=3+1 U(N) super-Yang-Mills. The SYM coupling is given by the (complex)
                                                      1 1       χ
IIB string coupling, more precisely g 21 + i 8πθ 2 = 2π ( g + i 2π ) where χ is the value of the
                                       YM

RR scalar.
    The supersymmetry group of AdS5 ×S 5 , is known to be the same as the superconformal
group in 3+1 spacetime dimensions [3], so the supersymmetries of both theories are the
same. This is a new form of “duality”: a large N field theory is related to a string theory
on some background, notice that the correspondence is non-perturbative in g and the
SL(2, Z) symmetry of type IIB would follow as a consequence of the SL(2, Z) symmetry

                                               4
of SYM6 . It is also a strong-weak coupling correspondence in the following sense. When
the effective coupling gN becomes large we cannot trust perturbative calculations in the
Yang-Mills theory but we can trust calculations in supergravity on (AdS5 × S 5 )N . This
is suggesting that the N = 4 Yang-Mills master field is the anti-deSitter supergravity
solution (similar ideas were suggested in [17]). Since N measures the size of the geometry
in Planck units, we see that quantum effects in AdS5 × S 5 have the interpretation of 1/N
effects in the gauge theory. So Hawking radiation is a 1/N effect. It would be interesting
to understand more precisely what the horizon means from the gauge theory point of view.
IIB supergravity on AdS5 × S 5 was studied in [7,9].
      The above conjecture becomes nontrivial for large N and gives a way to answer some
large N questions in the SYM theory. For example, suppose that we break U (N ) →
U (N − 1) × U (1) by Higgsing. This corresponds to putting a three brane at some point
on the 5-sphere and some value of U , with world volume directions along the original four
dimensions (x|| ). We could now ask what the low energy effective action for the light U(1)
fields is. For large N (2.4) it is the action of a D3 brane in AdS5 × S 5 . More concretely,
the bosonic part of the action becomes the Born-Infeld action on the AdS background

                                                                              √

with α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3, i, j = 1, .., 5; and gij is the metric of the unit five-sphere. As any low
energy action, (2.6) is valid when the energies are low compared to the mass of the massive
states that we are integrating out. In this case the mass of the massive states is proportional
to U (with no factors of N ). The low energy condition translates into ∂U/U ≪ U and
∂θ i << U , etc.. So the nonlinear terms in the action (2.6) will be important only when gN
is large. It seems that the form of this action is completely determined by superconformal
invariance, by using the broken and unbroken supersymmetries, in the same sense that
the Born Infeld action in flat space is given by the full Poincare supersymmetry [18]. It
would be very interesting to check this explicitly. We will show this for a particular term
in the action. We set θ i = const and F = 0, so that we only have U left. Then we will
show that the action is completely determined by broken conformal invariance. This can

      This is similar in spirit to [16] but here N is not interpreted as momentum.

be seen as follows. Using Lorentz invariance and scaling symmetry (dimensional analysis)
one can show that the action must have the form
                              Z
                          S = dp+1 xU p+1 f (∂α U ∂ α U/U 4 ) ,                               (2.7)

where f is an arbitrary function. Now we consider infinitesimal special conformal trans-
formations

where ǫα is an infinitesimal parameter. For the moment R̃ is an arbitrary constant. We
will later identify it with the “radius” of AdS, it will turn out that R̃4 ∼ gN . In the limit
of small R̃ we recover the more familiar form of the conformal transformations (U is a
weight one field). Usually conformal transformations do not involve the variable U in the
transformations of x. For constant U the extra term in (2.8) is a translation in x, but we
will take U to be a slowly varying function of x and we will determine R̃ from other facts
that we know. Demanding that (2.7) is invariant under (2.8) we find that the function f
in (2.7) obeys the equation

supersymmetry. We need to use three facts. The first is that there is no force (no vacuum
energy) for a constant U . This implies a = 1. The second is that the ∂U 2 term (F 2 term)
in the U (1) action is not renormalized. The third is that the only contribution to the (∂U )4
term (an F 4 term) comes from a one loop diagram [19]. This determines all the coefficients
to be those expected from (2.6) including the fact that R̃4 = 4πgN . It seems very plausible
that using all 32 supersymmetries we could fix the action (2.6) completely. This would be
saying that (2.6) is a consequence of the symmetries and thus not a prediction7 . However
we can make very nontrivial predictions (though we were not able to check them). For
example, if we take g to be small (but N large) we can predict that the Yang-Mills theory
contains strings. More precisely, in the limit g → 0, gN = fixed ≫ 1 (’t Hooft limit) we
  7
      Notice that the action (2.6) includes a term proportional to v 6 similar to that calculated in
[20]. Conformal symmetry explains the agreement that they would have found if they had done
the calculation for 3+1 SYM as opposed to 0+1.

find free strings in the spectrum, they are IIB strings moving in (AdS5 × S 5 )gN .8 The
sense in which these strings are present is rather subtle since there is no energy scale in
the Yang-Mills to set their tension. In fact one should translate the mass of a string state
from the AdS description to the Yang-Mills description. This translation will involve the
position U at which the string is sitting. This sets the scale for its mass. As an example,
consider again the D-brane probe (Higgsed configuration) which we described above. From
the type IIB description we expect open strings ending on the D3 brane probe. From the
                                                                           U
                                                                                 p
point of view of the gauge theory these open strings have energies E = (4πgN)1/4   Nopen
where Nopen is the integer charaterizing the massive open string level. In this example we
see that α′ disappears when we translate the energies and is replaced by U , which is the
energy scale of the Higgs field that is breaking the symmetry.
      Now we turn to the question of the physical interpretation of U . U has dimensions
of mass. It seems natural to interpret motion in U as moving in energy scales, going to
the IR for small U and to the UV for large U. For example, consider a D3 brane sitting
at some position U . Due to the conformal symmetry, all physics at energy scales ω in this
theory is the same as physics at energies ω ′ = λω, with the brane sitting at U ′ = λU .
      Now let us turn to another question. We could separate a group of D3 branes from
the point were they were all sitting originally. Fortunately, for the extremal case we can
find a supergravity solution describing this system. All we have to do is the replacement

      In fact, Polyakov [21] recently proposed that the string theory describing bosonic Yang-Mills
has a new dimension corresponding to the Liouville mode ϕ, and that the metric at ϕ = 0 is zero
due to a “zig-zag” symmetry. In our case we see that the physical distances along the directions
of the brane contract to zero as U → 0. The details are different, since we are considering the
N = 4 theory.

                                                 7
For large U ≫ |W | we find basically the solution for (AdS5 × S 5 )N which is interpreted
as saying that for large energies we do not see the fact that the conformal symmetry
was broken, while for small U ≪ |W | we find just (AdS5 × S 5 )N−M , which is associated
to the CFT of the unbroken U (N − M ) piece. Furthermore, if we consider the region
 ~ −W
|U   ~ | ≪ |W
            ~ | we find (AdS5 × S 5 )M , which is described by the CFT of the U (M ) piece.
    We could in principle separate all the branes from each other. For large values of
U we would still have (AdS5 × S 5 )N , but for small values of U we would not be able to
trust the supergravity solution, but we naively get N copies of (AdS5 × S 5 )1 which should
correspond to the U (1)N .
    Now we discuss the issue of compactification. We want to consider the YM theory
compactified on a torus of radii Ri , xi ∼ xi + 2πRi , which stay fixed as we take the
α′ → 0 limit. Compactifying the theory breaks conformal invariance and leaves only
the Poincare supersymmetries. However one can still find the supergravity solutions and
follow the above procedure, going near the horizon, etc. The AdS piece will contain some
identifications. So we will be able to trust the supergravity solution as long as the physical
length of these compact circles stays big in α′ units. This implies that we can trust the
supergravity solution as long as we stay far from the horizon (at U = 0)

                                             (gN )1/4
                                        U≫            ,                                (2.12)
                                               Ri

for all i. This is a larger bound than the naive expectation (1/Ri ). If we were considering
near extremal black holes we would require that U0 in (2.5) satisfies (2.12), which is, of
course, the same condition on the temperature gotten in [22].
    The relation of the three-brane supergravity solution and the Yang-Mills theory has
been studied in [23,24,25,26] . All the calculations have been done for near extremal D3
branes fall into the category described above. In particular the absorption cross section of
the dilaton and the graviton have been shown to agree with what one would calculate in
the YM theory [24,25]. It has been shown in [26] that some of these agreements are due
to non-renormalization theorems for N = 4 YM. The black hole entropy was compared to
the perturbative YM calculation and it agrees up to a numerical factor [23]. This is not
in disagreement with the correspondence we were suggesting, It is expected that large gN
effects change this numerical factor, this problem remains unsolved.
    Finally notice that the group SO(2, 4) × SO(6) suggests a twelve dimensional realiza-
tion in a theory with two times [27].

3.       Other cases with 16 → 32 supersymmetries, M5 and M2 brane theories
         Basically all that we have said for the D3 brane carries over for the other conformal
field theories describing coincident M-theory fivebranes and M-theory twobranes. We de-
scribe below the limits that should be taken in each of the two cases. Similar remarks
can be made about the entropies [28], and the determination of the probe actions using
superconformal invariance. Eleven dimensional supergravity on the corresponding AdS
spaces was studied in [8,10,11,15].

3.1. M 5 brane
         The decoupling limit is obtained by taking the 11 dimensional Planck length to zero,
lp → 0, keeping the worldvolume energies fixed and taking the separations U 2 ≡ r/lp3 =
fixed [29]. This last condition ensures that the membranes stretching between fivebranes
give rise to strings with finite tension.
         The metric is9
                                     ds2 = f −1/3 dx2|| + f 2/3 (dr 2 + r 2 dΩ24 ) ,
                                     πN lp3                                            (3.1)

                                             ,
                                       r3
We also have a flux of the four-form field strength on the four-sphere (which is quantized).
Again, in the limit we obtain
                                                                         2

                      ds       = lp2 [         1/3

                                                                           + (πN )2/3 dΩ24 ] ,   (3.2)
                                         (πN )                        U
where now the “radii” of the sphere and the AdS7 space are Rsph = RAdS /2 = lp (πN )1/3 .
Again, the “radii” are fixed in Planck units as we take lp → 0, and supergravity can be
applied if N ≫ 1.
         Reasoning as above we conclude that this theory contains seven dimensional Anti-
deSitter times a four-sphere, which for large N looks locally like eleven dimensional
Minkowski space.
         This gives us a method to calculate properties of the large N limit of the six dimen-
sional (0,2) conformal field theory [30]. The superconformal group again coincides with
the algebra of the supersymmetries preserved by AdS7 × S 4 . The bosonic symmetries are
SO(2, 6) × SO(5) [4]. We can do brane probe calculations, thermodynamic calculations
[28], etc.
         The conjecture is now that the (0,2) conformal field theory is dual to M-theory on
(AdS7 × S 4 )N , the subindex indicates the dependence of the “radius” with N .
     9
         In our conventions the relation of the Planck length to the 11 dimensional Newton constant
           7 9
is G11
    N = 16π lp .


                                                             9
3.2. M2 brane
                                                               3/2
     We now take the limit lp → 0 keeping U 1/2 ≡ r/lp               = fixed. This combination has
to remain fixed because the scalar field describing the motion of the twobrane has scaling
dimension 1/2. Alternatively we could have derived this conformal field theory by taking
first the field theory limit of D2 branes in string theory as in [31,32,33], and then taking the
strong coupling limit of that theory to get to the conformal point as in [34,35,36]. The fact
that the theories obtained in this fashion are the same can be seen as follows. The D2 brane
gauge theory can be obtained as the limit α′ → 0, keeping gY2 M ∼ g/α′ = fixed. This is the
                                                                                   3/2
same as the limit of M-theory two branes in the limit lp → 0 with R11 /lp                ∼ gY M = fixed.
                                                                             11
This is a theory where one of the Higgs fields is compact. Taking R               → ∞ we see that we
get the theory of coincident M2 branes, in which the SO(8) R-symmetry has an obvious
origin.
     The metric is
                           ds2 = f −2/3 dx2|| + f 1/3 (dr 2 + r 2 dΩ27 ) ,
                                        25 π 2 N lp6                                               (3.3)
                             f =1+                   ,
                                            r6
and there is a nonzero flux of the dual of the four-form field strength on the seven-sphere.
In the decoupling limit we obtain AdS4 × S 7 , and the supersymmetries work out correctly.
The bosonic generators are given by SO(2, 3) × SO(8). In this case the “radii” of the
sphere and AdS4 are Rsph = 2RAdS = lp (25 π 2 N )1/6 .
     The entropy of the near extremal solution agrees with the expectation from dimen-
sional analysis for a conformal theory in 2+1 dimensions [28], but the N dependence or
the numerical coefficients are not understood.
     Actually for the case of the two brane the conformal symmetry was used to determine
the v 4 term in the probe action [37], we are further saying that conformal invariance
determines it to all orders in the velocity of the probe. Furthermore the duality we have
proposed with M-theory on AdS4 × S 7 determines the precise numerical coefficient.
     When M-theory is involved the dimensionalities of the groups are suggestive of a
thirteen dimensional realization [38].



4. Theories with 8 → 16 supersymmetries, the D1+D5 system

     Now we consider IIB string theory compactified on M 4 (where M 4 = T 4 or K3) to
six spacetime dimensions. As a first example let us start with a D-fivebrane with four

                                                  10
dimensions wrapping on M 4 giving a string in six dimensions. Consider a system with Q5
fivebranes and Q1 D-strings, where the D-string is parallel to the string in six dimensions
arising from the fivebrane. This system is described at low energies by a 1+1 dimensional
(4,4) superconformal field theory. So we take the limit

                     r                              V4                       g
     α′ → 0 ,           = fixed ,           v≡             = fixed ,   g6 = √ = fixed     (4.1)
                     α′                          (2π)4 α′2                    v

where V4 is the volume of M 4 . All other moduli of M 4 remain fixed. This is just a low
energy limit, we keep all dimensionless moduli fixed. As a six dimensional theory, IIB on
M 4 contains strings. They transform under the U-duality group and they carry charges
given by a vector q I . In general we can consider a configuration where q 2 = ηIJ q I q J 6= 0
(the metric is the U-duality group invariant), and then take the limit (4.1).
    This theory has a branch which we will call the Higgs branch and one which we call the
Coulomb branch. On the Higgs branch the 1+1 dimensional vector multiplets have zero
expectation value and the Coulomb branch is the other one. Notice that the expectation
values of the vector multiplets in the Coulomb branch remain fixed as we take the limit
α′ → 0.
    The Higgs branch is a SCFT with (4,4) supersymmetry. This is the theory considered
in [39]. The above limit includes also a piece of the Coulomb branch, since we can separate
the branes by a distance such that the mass of stretched strings remains finite.
    Now we consider the supergravity solution corresponding to D1+D5 branes [40]
                                   −1/2 −1/2        1/2 1/2

                                                                                         (4.2)
                      f1 = 1 +             ,       f5 = 1 +              ,
                                 vr 2                            r2

where dx2|| = −dt2 + dx2 and x is the coordinate along the D-string. Some of the moduli
of M 4 vary over the solution and attain a fixed value at the horizon which depends only
on the charges and some others are constant throughout the solution. The three-form
RR-field strength is also nonzero.
    In the decoupling limit (4.1) we can neglect the 1’s in fi in (4.2) and the metric
becomes
                                     U2                    dU 2

                ds = α              √                                               .     (4.3)
                                 g 6 Q1 Q5                  U
The compact manifold M 4 (Q) that results in the limit is determined as follows. Some of
its moduli are at their fixed point value which depends only on the charges and not on

                                                   11
the asymptotic value of those moduli at infinity (the notation M 4 (Q) indicates the charge
dependence of the moduli)[41]10 . The other moduli, that were constant in the black hole
solution, have their original values. For example, the volume of M 4 has the fixed point
value vf ixed = Q1 /Q5 , while the six dimensional string coupling g6 has the original value.
Notice that there is an overall factor of α′ in (4.3) which can be removed by canceling it with
the factor of α′ in the Newton constant as explained above. We can trust the supergravity
solution if Q1 , Q5 are large, g6 Qi ≫ 1. Notice that we are talking about a six dimensional
supergravity solution since the volume of M 4 is a constant in Planck units (we keep the
Q1 /Q5 ratio fixed). The metric (4.3) describes three dimensional AdS3 times a 3-sphere.
The supersymmetries work out correctly, starting from the 8 Poincare supersymmetries
we enhance then to 16 supersymmetries. The bosonic component is SO(2, 2) × SO(4).
In conformal field theory language SO(2, 2) is just the SL(2, R) × SL(2, R) part of the
conformal group and SO(4) ∼ SU (2)L × SU (2)R are the R-symmetries of the CFT [43].
      So the conjecture is that the 1+1 dimensional CFT describing the Higgs branch of the
D1+D5 system on M 4 is dual to type IIB string theory on (AdS3 × S 3 )Q1 Q5 × M 4 (Q) .
                                                                           √
                                                                2
The subscript indicates that the radius of the three sphere is Rsph = α′ g6 Q1 Q5 . The
compact fourmanifold M 4 (Q) is at some particular point in moduli space determined as
follows. The various moduli of M 4 are divided as tensors and hypers according to the
(4,4) supersymmetry on the brane. Each hypermultiplet contains four moduli and each
tensor contains a modulus and an anti-self-dual B-field. (There are five tensors of this
type for T 4 and 21 for K3). The scalars in the tensors have fixed point values at the
horizon of the black hole, and those values are the ones entering in the definition of M 4 (Q)
(Q indicates the dependence on the charges). The hypers will have the same expectation
value everywhere. It is necessary for this conjecture to work that the 1+1 dimensional
(4,4) theory is indendent of the tensor moduli appearing in its original definition as a
limit of the brane configurations, since M 4 (Q) does not depend on those moduli. A non
renomalization theorem like [44,45] would explain this. We also need that the Higgs branch
decouples from the Coulomb branch as in [46,47].
      Finite temperature configurations in the 1+1 conformal field theory can be considered.
They correspond to near extremal black holes in AdS3 . The metric is the same as that of

 10
      The fixed values of the moduli are determined by the condition that they minimize the
tension of the corresponding string (carrying charges q I ) in six dimensions [41]. This is parallel
to the discussion in four dimensions [42].

the BTZ 2+1 dimensional black hole [48], except that the angle of the BTZ description
is not periodic. This angle corresponds to the spatial direction x of the 1+1 dimensional
CFT and it becomes periodic if we compactify the theory11 [49,50,51] 12 . All calculations
done for the 1D+5D system [39,53,54] are evidence for this conjecture. In all these cases
[54] the nontrivial part of the greybody factors comes from the AdS part of the spacetime.
Indeed, it was noticed in [55] that the greybody factors for the BTZ black hole were the
same as the ones for the five-dimensional black hole in the dilute gas approximation. The
dilute gas condition r0 , rn ≪ r1 r5 [53] is automatically satisfied in the limit (4.1) for finite
temperature configurations (and finite chemical potential for the momentum along x̂). It
was also noticed that the equations have an SL(2, R) × SL(2, R) symmetry [56], these are
the isometries of AdS3 , and part of the conformal symmetry of the 1+1 dimensional field
theory. It would be interesting to understand what is the gravitational counterpart of the
full conformal symmetry group in 1+1 dimensions.


5. Theories with 4 → 8 supersymmetries

      The theories of this type will be related to black strings in five dimensions and
Reissner-Nordström black holes in four dimensions. This part will be more sketchy, since
there are several details of the conformal field theories involved which I do not completely
understand, most notably the dependence on the various moduli of the compactification.

5.1. Black string in five dimensions

      One can think about this case as arising from M-theory on M 6 where M 6 is a CY
manifold, K3 × T 2 or T 6 . We wrap fivebranes on a four-cycle P4 = pA αA in M 6 with
nonzero triple self intersection number, see [57]. We are left with a one dimensional object
in five spacetime dimensions. Now we take the following limit

               lp → 0          (2π)6 v ≡ V6 /lp6 = fixed      U 2 ≡ r/lp3 = fixed ,          (5.1)
 11
      I thank G. Horowitz for many discussions on this correspondence and for pointing out ref.
[49] to me. Some of the remarks the remarks below arose in conversations with him.
 12
      The ideas in [49,50,51] could be used to show the relation between the AdS region and black
holes in M-theory on a light like circle. However the statement in [49,50,51] that the AdS3 × S 3
spacetime is U-dual to the full black hole solution (which is asymptotic to Minkowski space) should
be taken with caution because in those cases the spacetime has identifications on circles that are
becoming null. This changes dramatically the physics. For examples of these changes see [32,52].



                                                13
where lp is the eleven dimensional Planck length. In this limit the theory will reduce to a
conformal field theory in two dimensions. It is a (0,4) CFT and it was discussed in some
detail in a region of the moduli space in [57]. More generally we should think that the
five dimensional theory has some strings characterized by charges pA , forming a multiplet
of the U-duality group and we are taking a configuration where the triple self intersection
number p3 is nonzero (in the case M 6 = T 6 , p3 ≡ D ≡ DABC pA pB pC is the cubic E6
invariant).
     We now take the corresponding limit of the black hole solution. We will just present
the near horizon geometry, obtained after taking the limit. Near the horizon all the vector
moduli are at their fixed point values [58]. So the near horizon geometry can be calculated
by considering the solution with constant moduli. We get

                                      U 2 v 1/3                   D2/3      dU 2
                                                                                   

                                                                           4 2 + dΩ2    .   (5.2)

In this limit M 6 has its vector moduli equal to their fixed point values which depend only
on the charge while its hyper moduli are what they were at infinity. The overall size of
M 6 in Planck units is a hypermultiplet, so it remains constant as we take the limit (5.1).
We get a product of three dimensional AdS3 spacetime with a two-sphere, AdS3 × S 2 .
                                                3
Defining the five dimensional Planck length by l5p = lp3 /v we find that the “radii” of the
two sphere and the AdS3 are Rsph = RAdS /2 = l5p D1/3 . In this case the superconformal
group contains as a bosonic subgroup SO(2, 2) × SO(3). So the R-symmetries are just
SU (2)R , associated to the 4 rightmoving supersymmetries.
     In this case we conjecture that this (0,4) conformal field theory is dual, for large pA ,
to M-theory on AdS3 × S 2 × Mp6 . The hypermultiplet moduli of Mp6 are the same as the
ones entering the definition of the (0,4) theory. The vector moduli depend only on the
charges and their values are those that the black string has at the horizon. A necessary
condition for this conjecture to work is that the (0,4) theory should be independent of the
original values of the vector moduli (at least for large p). It is not clear to me whether
this is true.
     Using this conjecture we would get for large N a compactification of M theory which
has five extended dimensions.

5.2. Extremal 3+1 dimensional Reissner-Nordström

      This section is more sketchy and contains an unresolved puzzle, so the reader will not
miss much if he skips it.
      We start with IIB string theory compactified on M 6 , where M 6 is a Calabi-Yau
manifold or K3 × T 2 or T 6 . We consider a configuration of D3 branes that leads to a black
hole with nonzero horizon area. Consider the limit
                                           V6                    r

The string coupling is arbitrary. In this limit the system reduces to quantum mechanics
on the moduli space of the three-brane configuration.
      Taking the limit (5.3) of the supergravity solution we find

where N is proportional to the number of D3 branes. We find a two dimensional AdS2
                                                                       2
space times a two-sphere, both with the same radius R = l4p N , where l4p = g 2 α′ /v. The
bosonic symmetries of AdS2 × S 2 are SO(2, 1) × SO(3). This superconformal symmetry
seems related to the symmetries of the chiral conformal field theory that was proposed in
[59] to describe the Reissner-Nordström black holes. Here we find a puzzle, since in the
limit (5.3) we got a quantum mechanical system and not a 1+1 dimensional conformal
field theory. In the limit (5.3) the energy gap (mentioned in [60,59]) becomes very large13 .
So it looks like taking a large N limit at the same time will be crucial in this case. These
problems might be related to the large ground state entropy of the system.
      If this is understood it might lead to a proposal for a non perturbative definition of
M/string theory (as a large N limit) when there are four non-compact dimensions.
      It is interesting to consider the motion of probes on the AdS2 background. This cor-
responds to going into the “Coulomb” branch of the quantum mechanics. Dimensional
analysis says that the action has the form (2.7) with p = 0. Expanding f to first order we

gravity when we are close to the horizon. A similar analysis for Reissner-Nordström black
holes in five dimensions would give a term proportional to 1/r 4 [17]. It will be interesting
to check the coefficient (note that this is the only term allowed by the symmetries, as
opposed to [17]).

6.    Discussion, relation to matrix theory

      By deriving various field theories from string theory and considering their large N limit
we have shown that they contain in their Hilbert space excitations describing supergravity
on various spacetimes. We further conjectured that the field theories are dual to the full
quantum M/string theory on various spacetimes. In principle, we can use this duality to
give a definition of M/string theory on flat spacetime as (a region of) the large N limit of
the field theories. Notice that this is a non-perturbative proposal for defining such theories,
since the corresponding field theories can, in principle, be defined non-perturbatively. We
are only scratching the surface and there are many things to be worked out. In [61] it
has been proposed that the large N limit of D0 brane quantum mechanics would describe
eleven dimensional M-theory. The large N limits discussed above, also provide a definition
of M-theory. An obvious difference with the matrix model of [61] is that here N is not
interpreted as the momentum along a compact direction. In our case, N is related to the
curvature and the size of the space where the theory is defined. In both cases, in the
large N limit we expect to get flat, non-compact spaces. The matrix model [61] gives us a
prescription to build asymptotic states, we have not shown here how to construct graviton
states, and this is a very interesting problem. On the other hand, with the present proposal
it is more clear that we recover supergravity in the large N limit.
      This approach leads to proposals involving five (and maybe in some future four)
non-compact dimensions. The five dimensional proposal involves considering the 1+1
dimensional field theory associated to a black string in five dimensions. These theories
need to be studied in much more detail than we have done here.
      It seems that this correspondence between the large N limit of field theories and
supergravity can be extended to non-conformal field theories. An example was considered
in [1], where the theory of NS fivebranes was studied in the g → 0 limit. A natural
interpretation for the throat region is that it is a region in the Hilbert space of a six
dimensional “string” theory14 . And the fact that contains gravity in the large N limit is
just a common feature of the large N limit of various field theories. The large N master
field seems to be the anti-deSitter supergravity solutions [17].
      When we study non extremal black holes in AdS spacetimes we are no longer re-
stricted to low energies, as we were in the discussion in higher dimensions [44,54]. The

 14
      This possibility was also raised by [62], though it is a bit disturbing to find a constant energy
flux to the UV (that is how we are interpreting the radial dimension).

                                                  16
restriction came from matching the AdS region to the Minkowski region. So the five dimen-
sional results [53,54] can be used to describe arbitrary non-extremal black holes in three
dimensional Anti-deSitter spacetimes. This might lead us to understand better where the
degrees of freedom of black holes really are, as well as the meaning of the region behind the
horizon. The question of the boundary conditions is very interesting and the conformal
field theories should provide us with some definite boundary conditions and will probably
explain us how to interpret physically spacetimes with horizons. It would be interesting
to find the connection with the description of 2+1 dimensional black holes proposed by
Carlip [63].
    In [8,13] super-singleton representations of AdS were studied and it was proposed
that they would describe the dynamics of a brane “at the end of the world”. It was also
found that in maximally supersymmetric cases it reduces to a free field [8]. It is tempting
therefore to identify the singleton with the center of mass degree of freedom of the branes
[6,13]. A recent paper suggested that super-singletons would describe all the dynamics
of AdS [51]. The claim of the present paper is that all the dynamics of AdS reduces to
previously known conformal field theories.
    It seems natural to study conformal field theories in Euclidean space and relate them
to deSitter spacetimes.
    Also it would be nice if these results could be extended to four-dimensional gauge
theories with less supersymmetry.

7. Appendix

    D = p + 2-dimensional anti-deSitter spacetimes can be obtained by taking the hyper-
boloid
                        2
                      −X−1                              2
                           − X02 + X12 + · · · + Xp2 + Xp+1 = −R2 ,                     (7.1)

embedded in a flat D+1 dimensional spacetime with the metric η = Diag(−1, −1, 1, · · · , 1).
We will call R the “radius” of AdS spacetime. The symmetry group SO(2, D − 1) =

                                             17
SO(2, p + 1) is obvious in this description. In order to make contact with the previously
presented form of the metric let us define the coordinates

                             U = (X−1 + Xp+1 )
                                   Xα R
                            xα =                    α = 0, 1, · · · , p                 (7.2)
                                    U
                                                        x2 U   R2
                             V = (X−1 − Xp+1 ) =             +    .
                                                         R2    U

The induced metric on the hyperboloid (7.1) becomes

                                           U2 2      2 dU
                                                          2
                                   ds2 =      dx + R        .                           (7.3)
                                           R2           U2

This is the form of the metric used in the text. We could also define Ũ = U/R2 so that
metric (7.3) has an overall factor of R2 , making it clear that R is the overall scale of the
metric. The region outside the horizon corresponds to U > 0, which is only a part of
(7.1). It would be interesting to understand what the other regions in the AdS spacetime
correspond to. For further discussion see [65].
