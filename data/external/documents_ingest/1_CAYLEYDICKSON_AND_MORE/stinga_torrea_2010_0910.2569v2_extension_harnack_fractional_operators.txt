EXTENSION PROBLEM AND HARNACK’S INEQUALITY FOR SOME
FRACTIONAL OPERATORS

arXiv:0910.2569v2 [math.AP] 26 Apr 2010

PABLO RAÚL STINGA AND JOSÉ LUIS TORREA
Abstract. The fractional Laplacian can be obtained as a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map via an extension problem to the upper half space. In this paper we prove the same type of characterization
for the fractional powers of second order partial differential operators in some class. We also get
a Poisson formula and a system of Cauchy-Riemann equations for the extension. The method is
applied to the fractional harmonic oscillator H σ = (−∆ + |x|2 )σ to deduce a Harnack’s inequality.
A pointwise formula for H σ f (x) and some maximum and comparison principles are derived.

1. Introduction
In the last years there has been a growing interest in the study of nonlinear problems involving
fractional powers of the Laplace operator (−∆)σ , 0 < σ < 1. The fractional Laplacian of a function
f : Rn → R is defined via Fourier transform as
\
σ f (ξ) = |ξ|2σ fb(ξ),
(−∆)

(1.1)

and it can be expressed by the pointwise formula
σ

(1.2)

(−∆) f (x) = cn,σ P. V.

f (x) − f (z)

where cn,σ is a positive constant. Observe from (1.2) that the fractional Laplacian is a nonlocal
operator. This fact does not allow to apply local PDE techniques to treat nonlinear problems for
(−∆)σ . To overcome this difficulty, L. Caffarelli and L. Silvestre showed in [2] that any fractional
power of the Laplacian can be determined as an operator that maps a Dirichlet boundary condition
to a Neumann-type condition via an extension problem. To be more precise, consider the function
u = u(x, y) : Rn × [0, ∞) → R that solves the boundary value problem
(1.3)

u(x, 0) = f (x),

x ∈ Rn , y > 0.

y→0+

This characterization of (−∆)σ f via the local (degenerate) PDE (1.4) was used for the first time in
[1] to get regularity estimates for the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.
To solve (1.3)-(1.4), Caffarelli and Silvestre noted that (1.4) can be though as the harmonic extension of f in 2 − 2σ dimensions more (see [2]). From there, they established the fundamental solution
and, using a conjugate equation, a Poisson formula for u. Furthermore, taking advantage of the
general theory of degenerate elliptic equations developed by Fabes, Jerison, Kenig and Serapioni in
1982-83, they proved Harnack’s estimates for u (and thus for f ).

Let Ω be an open subset of Rn , n ≥ 1, and let dη be a positive measure defined on Ω. Consider a
linear second order partial differential operator L, that we assume to be nonnegative, densely defined,
and self-adjoint in L2 (Ω, dη). The fractional powers Lσ , 0 < σ < 1, can be defined in a spectral way,
see Section 2.
The aim of this paper is to describe any fractional power Lσ as an operator that maps a Dirichlet
condition to a Neumann-type condition via an extension problem as in [2], developing also the corresponding properties (Poisson formula, fundamental solution, conjugate equation, Cauchy-Riemann
equations). With this characterization, the interior Harnack’s inequality for any fractional power of
one of the most basic Schrödinger operators, the harmonic oscillator H = −∆ + |x|2 , is consequently
deduced. Besides, we find an explicit pointwise expression for the nonlocal operator H σ that will
allow us to get some maximum and comparison principles.
Fractional operators appear in physics, when considering fractional kinetics and anomalous transport [14].

The heat-diffusion semigroup e−tL t≥0 generated by L will play a crucial role in our work.
Our first main result is the following.

All identities in Theorem 1.1 are understood in L2 (Ω, dη). Note that a solution u to the degenerate
boundary value problem (1.5)-(1.6) is written explicitly in terms of the heat semigroup e−tL acting
on Lσ f . From here, the Poisson formula (1.9) can be immediately obtained (see the proof in Section
2), where no fractional power of L is involved. When L = −∆, the extension result of [2] is recovered
(see Examples 2.14). More properties concerning the Poisson formula are contained in Theorem 2.1.
Moreover, (1.9) can be derived as in [2] (Remark 2.6): use the fundamental solution (that involves
the kernel of the heat semigroup generated by L) and an appropriate conjugate equation (2.10) to
infer the Poisson kernel (see (2.11)). The conjugate equation will be studied in detail by defining
Cauchy-Riemann equations (2.12) adapted to equation (1.6). See Section 2.
If L has discrete spectrum, i.e. Lφk = λk φk , λk ≥ 0, and {φk }k∈N0 is an orthonormal basis of
L2 (Ω, dη), the definition of the fractional power Lσ is given in the natural way: if f ∈ L2 (Ω, dη) has

sum in L2 (Ω).

In Section 3 it is shown that, under this assumption, (1.5)-(1.6) has a unique solution u (vanishing
2
as y → ∞) such that (1.8) holds
P in the L (Ω)-sense. The proof is elementary using orthogonal
expansions: just write u(x, y) = k ck (y)φk (x) and observe that the coefficients ck satisfy a Bessel
equation. Hence, for the existence and uniqueness in this case, the general theory of degenerate PDE’s
mentioned above is not needed. This method also gives us local Neumann solutions (see Subsection
3.2).

EXTENSION PROBLEM AND HARNACK’S INEQUALITY

Let us now turn to the case of the fractional harmonic oscillator. We will be able to define H σ f for
all tempered distributions f . If f is a function that has also some local regularity then the extension
result is true in the classical sense (Theorem 4.2 and Remark 4.3). This last fact is an essential
ingredient for the second main result of this article: the interior Harnack’s inequality for H σ .
Theorem 1.2. Let x0 ∈ Rn and R > 0. Then there exists a positive constant C depending only on
n, σ, x0 and R such that
sup f ≤ C inf f,
BR/2 (x0 )

BR/2 (x0 )

for all nonnegative functions f : Rn → R that are C 2 in BR (x0 ) and such that H σ f (x) = 0 for all
x ∈ BR (x0 ).
The Harnack’s inequality is valid for 0 < σ < 1 and the proof given in Section 4 is based (as we
already remarked) on Theorem 4.2 and the Harnack’s inequality for degenerate Schrödinger operators
proved by C. E. Gutiérrez in [4] (this idea is contained in [2] for the case of the fractional Laplacian).
The Harnack’s inequality for H (σ = 1) follows from general results (see [13]).
The final part of the paper is devoted to the study of the pointwise expression of the fractional
harmonic oscillator and some of its consequences. To that end we collect some previous facts about
the fractional Laplacian (−∆)σ . The natural way to arrive to (1.2) starting from (1.1) would be by
taking the inverse Fourier transform. However, this path can be avoided if we consider the classical
formula for Lσ that involves the heat-diffusion semigroup generated by L:
Z ∞

e−tL f (x) − f (x) 1+σ .
(1.11)
Lσ f (x) =

Note that (1.11) is motivated by the identity λ = Γ(−σ) 0 (e
, λ > 0. When L = −∆ and
−1) t1+σ
f ∈ S in (1.11), the Fourier transform recovers (1.1). Furthermore, the formula allows us to obtain
(in a very simple way) expression (1.2) with the constant cn,σ computed explicitly and in particular
to see (Proposition 5.3) that if a function f is C 2 around some x ∈ Rn then
lim (−∆)σ f (x) = −∆f (x).

σ→1−

In Section 5 we put L = H in (1.11) to get a pointwise formula for H σ f (x) (see Theorem 5.7) and,
from there, some maximum and comparison principles for H σ .
Throughout this paper S is the Schwartz class of rapidly decreasing C ∞ (Rn ) functions, the letter C
denotes a constant that may change in each occurrence and it will depend on the parameters involved
(whenever it is necessary we point out this dependence with subscripts) and Γ stands for the Gamma
function. We restrict our attention to 0 < σ < 1 and, in this range, Γ(−σ) := Γ(1−σ)
< 0.

2. The extension problem
We begin with the basics of the spectral analysis that will be used throughout this Section. The
complete details can be found in [8, Ch. 12 and 13]. Since L is a nonnegative, densely defined and
self-adjoint operator on L2 (Ω, dη) = L2 (Ω), there is a unique resolution E of the identity, supported
on the spectrum of L (which is a subset of [0, ∞)), such that

The identity above is a shorthand notation that means
Z ∞
hLf, giL2 (Ω) =
λ dEf,g (λ),
f ∈ Dom(L), g ∈ L2 (Ω),
0

where dEf,g (λ) is a regular Borel complex measure of bounded variation concentrated on the spectrum
of L, with d |Ef,g | (0, ∞) ≤ kf kL2 (Ω) kgkL2 (Ω) . If φ(λ) is a real measurable function defined on [0, ∞),
then the operator φ(L) is given formally by

Since f ∈ Dom(Lσ ), e−tL (Lσ f ) ∈ L2 (Ω). Moreover, e− 4t /t1−σ is integrable near 0 as a function of t.

of variables t = r/λ, we have

Therefore, for each fixed y > 0, uR (·, y) is in L2 (Ω), and kuR (·, y)kL2 (Ω) ≤ kf kL2 (Ω) .

In what follows, we assume that the heat-diffusion semigroup is given by integration against a
nonnegative heat kernel Kt (x, z), t > 0, x, z ∈ Ω, that is,

Kt (x, z)f (z) dη(z).

Since e
is self-adjoint, Kt (x, z) = Kt (z, x). The second assumption we make is that the heat kernel
belongs to the domain of L, and ∂t Kt (x, z) = LKt (x, z), the derivative with respect to t is understood
in the classical sense. This implies that

ε > 0, such that kKt (x, ·)kL2 (Ω) + k∂t Kt (x, ·)kL2 (Ω) ≤ Cx (1 + tε )t−ε .

In order to see that the Poisson kernel satisfies (1.6), we begin by showing that it belongs to the

Remark 2.6. As in [2] the fundamental solution (2.8) and the “conjugate equation” (2.10) (which
coincides with the conjugate equation given in [2] when L R= −∆) can help us to find the Poisson
kernel (2.6). Indeed, we want to write u(x, y) = Pyσ f (x) = Ω Pyσ (x, z)f (z) dη(z) where the Poisson
kernel Pyσ (x, z) must be a solution of (1.6) for all z and limy→0+ Pyσ f (x) = f (x). The right choice
would be
41−σ Γ(1 − σ)
y 1−2(1−σ) ∂y Ψ1−σ

since it solves the “conjugate equation” (2.10) with 1 − σ in the place of σ (thus it verifies (1.6)) and

In the following discussion we shall assume that the operator L can be factorized as L = Di∗ Di ,
where Di = ai (xi )∂xi + bi (xi ), is a one dimensional (in the ith direction) partial differential operator,
and Di∗ is the formal adjoint (with respect to dη) of Di . See examples at the end of this Section. In
this case we give a definition of n conjugate functions related to the Poisson formula for u.
Let Eσ = −L + 1−2σ

Remark 2.8. The ith conjugate equation (2.13) is not the same as the “conjugate equation” (2.10).
They will coincide only when [Di∗ , Di ] = 0. This is the case if L = −∆: the conjugate equation
established in [2] is equal to each ith conjugate equation (2.13).
Proposition 2.9. Fix z ∈ Ω and choose u(x, y) = Pyσ (x, z). Then a solution to (2.12) is given by

Remark 2.13. The conclusion of Theorem 2.12 can also be obtained from the following observation:
except for a multiplicative constant, the last formula of (2.15) is just the Di -derivative of the solution
of the extension problem (1.6) for L1−σ with boundary value L−(1−σ) f (x) (see (1.7)). For σ = 1/2,
Theorem 2.12 establishes the boundary convergence to the Riesz transforms Di L−1/2 (which in case
L = −∆ are the classical Riesz transforms ∂xi (−∆)−1/2 ). See [11] and [12].
Examples 2.14. We present now some examples of operators L for which our results apply.

We would like to point out that in these cases, due to the existence of smooth eigenfunctions,
the proof of Theorem 1.1 can be performed as an exercise of convergence of orthogonal systems,
and it makes it technically simpler.
Elliptic operators: Let L be a positive self-adjoint linear elliptic partial differential operator
on L2 (Ω), with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and bounded measurable coefficients. Then the
heat kernel exists, and it verifies our assumptions stated before Theorem 2.1. Even more, its
heat kernel has Gaussian bounds [3, p. 89]. We can also consider Schrödinger operators with
nonnegative potentials in a large class [3, Section 4.5].
3. Existence and uniqueness results for the extension problem
In this section we derive the concrete solution of the extension problem in the case of discrete
spectrum. We also find solutions with null Neumann condition. This is done by using classical
Fourier’s method.
Let {φk }k∈N0 be an orthonormal basis of L2 (Ω) such that Lφk = λk φk , λk ≥ 0. Recall the definition
of Lσ given in (1.10).
3.1. L2 theory. Let f ∈ L2 (Ω) and look for solutions u to (1.5)-(1.6) of the form
X
(3.1)
u(x, y) =

Then for each k ≥ 0 we have to solve the following ordinary differential equation:
−λk ck +

1 − 2σ ′
ck + c′′k = 0,
y

y > 0,

with initial condition ck (0) = hf, φk i. According to [6, p. 106], this last equation has a general solution
of the form
1/2

ck (y) = y σ Zσ (±iλk y),

(3.2)

where Zσ is a linear combination of Bessel functions of order σ. To have uniqueness of the solution include the boundary condition limy→∞ u(x, y) = 0, weakly in L2 (Ω), which translates to the
coefficients as
(3.3)

lim ck (y) = 0.

y→∞

From [6, p. 104], Zσ can be written as
(3.4)

solution is the first linear combination of (3.4) as soon as A1 = 0: ck (y) = A2,k y σ Hσ (iλk y). If Kσ

1/2
(3.6) it is enough to fix R > 0 and put C2,k = Ce−λk R .
In this way we obtained a solution u to equation (1.6) in Ω × (0, R) that satisfies the required
property (3.9).
4. The Harnack’s inequality for H σ
To prove the Harnack’s inequality in Theorem 1.2 we first study the problem (1.5)-(1.6) for the

In the particular case we are considering in this Section, Theorem 1.1 takes the following form, in
which the relevant observation is that all identities are classical.

Remark 4.4. Theorem 4.2 is valid if H is replaced by −∆ and the function f , with the same
smoothness in O, belongs to Lσ := L1n/2+σ . See the discussion on (−∆)σ given in Section 5.

Proof. A nontrivial solution u can be found with the method of Subsection 3.2 since the eigenfunctions
of the harmonic oscillator H are the Hermite functions hα , α ∈ Nn0 , with corresponding eigenvalues

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let u be as in Theorem 4.2. Since f is a nonnegative function, from (4.2) and
(4.5) we see that u ≥ 0. Because of Remark 4.3, its reflection (4.8) satisfies Lemma 4.5. Note that
(4.9) is a degenerate Schrödinger equation with A2 weight w = |y|1−2σ and potential V = |y|1−2σ |x|2
such that V /w ∈ Lpw locally for p large enough. So we can apply the result of [4] to obtain the
Harnack’s inequality for ũ and thus for f .

5. Pointwise formula for H σ and some of its consequences
The semigroup language adopted in Section 2, allows us to get the exact pointwise formula for the
fractional Laplacian (−∆)σ on Rn . The constants involved in the definition are computed exactly in
an easy way.

When f ∈ S it is clear (by Fourier transform) that limσ→1− (−∆)σ f = −∆f . The next Proposition
shows that this is in fact valid for f ∈ C 2 . Note that if f ∈ S then, from (1.1), (−∆)σ f ∈

in (4.1)), consists of all locally integrable tempered distributions u for which (−∆)σ u can be defined.
If f ∈ Lσ is C 2 in an open set O then it can be proved that (−∆)σ f is a continuous function in O
and its values are given by the second integral in (5.1). For all the details see [9] and [10].
Proposition 5.3. Let f ∈ C 2 (B2 (x)) ∩ L∞ (Rn ) for some x ∈ Rn . Then
lim (−∆)σ f (x) = −∆f (x).

Proof. Fix an arbitrary ε > 0. Since f ∈ C 2 (B2 (x)) there exists δ = δε > 0 such that

Therefore limσ→1−1 |cn,σ II2 | ≤ Cn ε.

Remark 5.4. For f ∈ C 2 (B2 (x)) ∩ Lσ the second identity in (5.1) is valid (the idea is to use the
continuity of D2 f as in the proof of Proposition 5.3).
We shall now discuss the definition of the fractional harmonic oscillator H σ and the pointwise
formula for H σ f (x). The eigenfunctions of H (see [12]) are the multi-dimensional Hermite functions
2
defined on Rn as hα (x) = Φα (x)e−|x| /2 , α ∈ Nn0 , where Φα are the multi-dimensional Hermite
polynomials, and Hhα = (2 |α| + n)hα . Note that hα ∈ S. The set of Hermite functions forms an
orthonormal basis of L2 (Rn ). Let f ∈ S. The Hermite series expansion of f given by

We have the following important Lemma whose technical proof is given at the end of this section.
Lemma 5.6. H σ is a continuous operator on S.

18

P. R. STINGA AND J. L. TORREA

Lemma 5.6 together with the symmetry of H σ on S (that can be easily verified via Hermite series
expansions) allow us to give a distributional definition of H σ : for u ∈ S ′ , define H σ u ∈ S ′ through
hH σ u, f i := hu, H σ f i.

Therefore H σ is well defined for all functions u that are tempered distributions. In particular, u can
be taken from the space LpN of (4.1), 1 ≤ p < ∞, N > 0.
Recall the expression of Gt given in (4.2) and the fact that (see [5])

In (5.12) we see that H σ is a nonlocal operator. Before giving the proof of Theorem 5.7 we establish
some easy consequences.
Theorem 5.8 (Maximum principle for H σ ). Let f be a function in LpN that is C 2 in an open set
O ⊂ Rn . Assume that f ≥ 0 and f (x0 ) = 0 for some x0 ∈ O. Then H σ f (x0 ) ≤ 0. Moreover,
H σ f (x0 ) = 0 only when f ≡ 0.
Proof. By Theorem 5.7, since f, Fσ ≥ 0,

If f (z) > 0 in some set of positive measure, then the last inequality is strict.

Corollary 5.9 (Comparison principle for H σ ). Let f, g ∈ LpN ∩ C 2 (O) be such that f ≥ g and
f (x0 ) = g(x0 ) at some x0 ∈ O. Then H σ f (x0 ) ≤ H σ g(x0 ). Moreover, H σ f (x0 ) = H σ g(x0 ) only
when f ≡ g.
We devote the rest of this paper to the proofs of Lemma 5.6, Theorem 5.7, Proposition 4.1, and to
complete the missing details at the end of Section 3.

Hence Iδ converges. The conclusion follows, for f ∈ S, by Fubini’s Theorem.
Now assume that f ∈ LpN , 1 ≤ p < ∞, N > 0, is a C 2 function in O. Then H σ f is well defined
as a tempered distribution. Fix an arbitrary x ∈ O and take δ > 0 so that Bδ (x) ⊂ O. Observe
that the integral in (5.12) is well defined: just apply Taylor’s Theorem (as above) in Iδ and the LpN
condition together with (5.20) in Iδc . Let ε > 0. There exists a sequence fk ∈ Cc∞ (Rn ) such that
D2 fk L∞ (B (x)) ≤ D2 f L∞ (B (x)) for all k, fk converges uniformly to f in Bδ (x) and fk → f in

For (4.3) note that if 0 < s < 12 , then s < t(s) < 34 s. The equality ∂t e−tH f (x) = Rn ∂t Gt (x, z)f (z) dz
is valid if the last integral is absolutely convergentRfor all t in some interval. But ∂t Gt (x, z)f (z) =
−Hx Gt (x, z)f (z), therefore we have to verify that Rn Hx Gt(s) (x, z)f (z) dz converges absolutely for
all s in some interval. This last statement is true since
