Abstract
Both real and complex connections have been used for canonical gravity: the
complex connection has SL(2, C) as gauge group, while the real connection
has SU (2) as gauge group. We show that there is an arbitrary parameter β
which enters in the definition of the real connection, in the Poisson brackets,
and therefore in the scale of the discrete spectra one finds for areas and
volumes in the corresponding quantum theory. A value for β could be could
be singled out in the quantum theory by the Hamiltonian constraint, or by
the rotation to the complex Ashtekar connection.

I. INTRODUCTION

A lot of recent work in canonical quantum gravity is based on using as canonical variables
the pair (E ia , Aia ), where E ia is a triad of density weight one and Aia a real SU(2) connection;
these variables were introduced by Barbero [1] as an alternative to the complex Ashtekar
variables [2]. For SU(2) to be the gauge group for general relativity we have to fix the local
inertial frames, choosing what is called ”time gauge”; once this choice is made, it will be
shown that there is a certain freedom in the choice of the connection, parametrized by a
variable β. No particular real real value of β has a geometric motivation, and any one gives
an acceptable, if somewhat bizarre, SU(2) connection. The choice β = i gives the Ashtekar
variables, requires that we impose reality conditions on the variables, but restores the full
invariance of the canonical theory under local Lorentz transformations; as an additional
benefit, this choice simplifies the expression of the hamiltonian constraint considerably.
The difference between these choices becomes important when we attempt to quantize the
theory. It is difficult to find a scalar product if the gauge group is SL(2, C), even in simplified
cases [3]. On the contrary, for gauge invariant functionals of a SU(2) connection, the metric
being well defined, one can study the spectrum of operators that can be interpreted as
representing the area of a surface and the volume of a region in space [4]; both these spectra
turn out to be discrete [5–8], indicating a discrete structure of space at the Planck scale.
Unfortunately, the arbitrary parameter β multiplies the scale of these spectra, and therefore
the results are meaningless unless we find a way to fix this constant. Since the constant
β appears explicitly in the expression of the Hamiltonian constraint, it may be that that
solutions to this constraint exist only for particular values, most likely β = 1. An alternative,
but strictly related possibility would be that β = 1 is required because it is the value for
which a rotation to the Ashtekar variables is possible [9,10], restoring the gauge group
SL(2, C). Both these goals have been attempted in recent work [11].
II. CONNECTIONS.

A canonical
formulation of general relativity may be obtained starting from the action
1 R
S = 4κ
ǫIJKL eI ∧eJ ∧RKL (where I, J, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, eI are vierbeins, RKL is the curvature
2–form of the Levi–Civita connection ΩIJ , and κ := (8πGN ewton )/c3 ), then taking space slices
Σt : t(x) =const. with a vector ta : ta ∂a t = 1 related to the unit normal to the slice na by
ta = Nna + N a , or na = −N∂a t. If at this stage we partially fix the O(3, 1) gauge freedom
choosing ”time gauge”, i.e. setting:
e0a = −na = N∂a t

(1)

we are left with invariance under local O(3) transformations with eia , i = 1, 2, 3 space–like
providing a local frame on the slice and the inverse 3–metric q ab = eia eib . The pull–back
of ΩIJ to the space slice gives the 3–d Levi–Civita connection Γia := 12 qab ǫjik Ωjk
b , and the
i
b 0i
ib
extrinsic curvature Ka := qa Ωb = e Kab . Instead of the A.D.M. variables (qab , π ab :=
√
q(K ab − q ab K)), we can take the pair [9]:
1
√
(E ia := ǫ̃abc ǫijk ejb ekc = q eia ,
2
2

Kai )

(2)

From the definitions it follows that for small variations:
1
Kai δE ia = √ Kab δ(E ia E i ) =
2 q
1
1
1
= (πab − π qab )δ(qq ab ) = − π ab δqab
2q
2
2

(3)

and therefore the only non vanishing Poisson-brackets are:
{Kai (x), E jb (y)} = κδab δ ij δ(x, y)

(4)

i
With the connection Γia we can compute covariant derivatives Da and the curvature Rab
,
and write the constraints of the theory in the form:

Gi := ǫijk Kaj E ka ≈ 0
Vc := qbc ∇a π ab = 2Eia D[a Kc]i ≈ 0
1
1
H := √ (π ab πab − π 2 − q R) =
q
2


1
[a b]
i
= √
2Ei Ej Kaj Kbi + ǫijk E ia E jb Rab
≈0
det E

(5)

The first constraint has been added to the A.D.M. ones to make sure that Kab is symmetrical.
The trouble with this formulation is that Γia is a derived quantity, that can be expressed
in terms of E ia , its derivatives and its inverse solving the 9 linear equations it satisfies:
Da E ia = 0

;

(b

c)

ǫijk Eia Ej Da Ek = 0

(6)

To obtain a connection that is in some sense a conjugate quantity to the triads we may
follow [1] and change our basic variables, for some β to be fixed, to:
(E ia , A(β)i
:= Γia + β Kai )
a

(7)

By the properties of the Levi–Civita connection, we find:
E ia δA(β)i
= βE ia δKai + E ia δΓia =
a
= βE ia δKai + ∂a (ǫ̃abc ekb δekc )

(8)

so that the only non vanishing Poisson brackets are:
jb
i b
{A(β)i
a (x), E (y)} = βκ δj δa δ(x, y)

(9)

Unlike Kai , A(β)i
transforms like an SU(2) connection for any β, so that one can have Da(β)
a
R
(β)i
a
derivatives, a curvature Fab , and for any path γ a ”transporters” gγ := P exp( τi A(β)i
a dγ ).
Geometrically, all this is perhaps a bit artificial: we are using a connection with torsion, and
we are smuggling the dynamics of the theory in this torsion.
With some algebra one finds that the constraints eq. (5) can be rewritten in the form:

3

Da(β) E ia = βGi ≈ 0
(β)i

= β Vb + β 2 Kbj Gj ≈ 0
(1 + β 2 ) [a b] i j
ǫijk
(β)k
E ia E jb Fab − 2 q
Ei Ej Ka Kb
H=q
det(E)
det(E)
+... ≈ 0
E ia Fab

(10)

where the dots are terms proportional to βGi and its derivatives.
Clearly,
q complications will come from the last constraint, in particular from its overall
factor 1/ det(E) and from the messy term proportional to (1 + β 2 ). The quickest way to
get rid of it would be to take βq
= i, which is Ashtekar’s original choice [2](together with the
idea of absorbing the factor 1/ det(E) in the Lagrange multiplier). But this choice can be
motivated by much more than the simplification of the constraints: in fact for this value of
β the variables eq.(7) can be defined quite generally, without the gauge choice eq. (1), as the
pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual connection, and of the self–dual product of two
vierbeins:
0i
:= qab (− 12 ǫijk Ωjk
b + iΩb )
det(eIa ) i
i I J
E ia := −ǫabc CIJ
eb ec = −2i
CIJ nb eIb eJa
N

i
Aa(i)i := qab CIJ
ΩIJ
b

(11)
(12)

i
here CIJ
projects antisymmetric tensors to the (1, 0) representation of SL(2, C), i.e. selects
i
i
the self–dual part, so that ǫIJKL CKL
= 2iCIJ
. This definition of the basic variables coincides
with eq. (2) if we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1), but we have to add to the constraints eq. (10)
the reality conditions:

E ia E ib = real ;

(b

c)

ǫijk Eia Ej Da(i) Ek = imaginary

(13)

On the other hand, adopting this connection we retain the Lorentz group as gauge group of
the canonical theory1 .
Because of the obvious complications of dealing with complex variables and with the noncompact gauge group SL(2, C), the alternative choice β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”, has
been used in all the more recent work. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the second term of H
is proportional to (1 − β 2 ), and the choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”natural”
for the (–+++) signature, but that is not particularly relevant, unless somehow we learn to
”Wick–rotate” the theory. Otherwise, there is no obvious geometric meaning, and nothing
special about the value β = 1, and and we can leave β arbitrary (but real > 0) in the
following.
One can also introduce a Poisson bracket preserving map on the algebra of functions on
phase space which, in a certain sense, allow us to change β. Following Thiemann [10], one
notices that

1 It is not often emphasized that the derivation of the Ashtekar variables does not require any

gauge fixing, but it is obvious from their original definitions; for ex. the alternative definition given
for E ia in eq.(12) is a direct transcription of eq.1.13b of [12]

(14)

from eq. (4) and the properties of Levi–Civita connections has the following Poisson brackets:
{T, E ia } = E ia ;

{T, Γia } = 0 ;

{T, Kai } = −Kai

(15)

It follows that if we indicate the Hamiltonian evolution induced by some H on a function f
on phase space by the map:
t2
{{f, H}, H} + . . .
2!

(16)

WT (t) ◦ A(β)i
= Γia + βet Kai
a

(17)

WH (t) ◦ f := f + t{f, H} +
we shall have:
WT (t) ◦ E ia = e−t E ia ;

At a more speculative level, we can think of choosing t = iπ/2 and using this map to perform
a rotation from the β = 1 to the Ashtekar connection [10,9], similar to a ”Wick rotation”,
a possibility that is particularly exciting in the quantum case.
III. QUANTIZATION.

To quantize the theory we may use the connection representation, in which states are
functionals of A(β)i
a (x), and
E ia

→

Ê ia :=

βκh̄ δ
i δA(β)i
a

(18)

The important states turn out to be ”spin net states”, which are an obvious generalization of
Wilson loops. Given a net n in 3–space with V vertices joined by (analytic) paths γ1 , . . . , γL ,
we assign: to each line an orientation, hence a ”transporter” gl , and a spin sl = 0, 12 , 1, . . .,
sl
v
so that γl → Dmm
′ (gl ); to each vertex v an SU(2) invariant tensor Cm ,..,m , in such a way
a
d
that:
ψn ({gl }) =

XY

v
C...

{m} v

Y
l

D..sl (gl )

(19)

is gauge invariant. If gl ∈ SU(2), and we indicate by dgl the Haar measure, the ψn that we
can associate to a given net form a Hilbert space with the scalar product:
< ψn′ |ψn >=

Z

ψ n′ ψn

Y

dgl

(20)

Ashtekar and collaborators have discovered (see e.g. [6]) that if one considers all possible
nets, then the set of these states is dense in the Hilbert space of gauge invariant functionals
of A(β) . In this sense eq.(20) induces a measure DA(β) in this space. One can therefore
define a Rovelli–Smolin ”loop transform” [13], and focus on states which have support on
”weaves” [4], huge nets with mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length. In recent work
these states have been used to find the spectrum of the operators that correspond to the
5

area of a surface S and to the volume of a region R, and to investigate the operator form of
the constraints.
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset L of lines of the net, does not touch the
vertices, has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the operator (first taking the square
root, then removing the regulator), one finds :
Â(S)ψn = :

This basic result has been extended in various directions, in particular to the volume operator
[5–8]. On the other hand, there is no known way to extend it to the theory based on the
Ashtekar connection: all operators seem to have the wrong hermiticity, whatever scalar
product we use.
However, it is clear from eq. (21) that the discrete spectra one gets for areas and volumes
cannot at this stage be interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of space, because of
the arbitrariness of β. The key ingredients we have used are the gauge invariance and the
commutation relations that correspond to the Poisson brackets eq. (9), and we must conclude
that by themselves they are not enough to fix the scale of the theory.
The quantization program requires therefore that we find some good reason to fix β. I
can imagine two ways in which this could happen. One could argue that a larger group
than SU(2) is necessary, as suggested for instance by the experience of current algebra,
and that one should insist on using the Ashtekar connection, overcoming the dificulties that
have been found; or that the states considered should be restricted by more than just gauge
invariance, in particular by the Hamiltonian constraint. In fact, it may well be that given
the way in which β enters eq. (10), the Wheeler De Witt equation Ĥ · Ψ = 0 will turn out
to have solutions only for particular values of β, a possibility that could be investigated in
Thiemann’s proposed realisation of Ĥ [11].
That these two ways may be related, or be the same, is indicated by another remarkable
Poisson bracket identity deduced by Thiemann:
(

√
ǫ
(β)k
√ ijk E ia E jb Fab
, det E
det E

)

= 2β 2 κE ia Kai δ(x, y)

(22)

If at the quantum level we could handle the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume, and
translate this equation, we would be able to implement the ”Wick rotation” from the Barbero
to the Ashtekar connection representation.
At the same time, it is also important to establish whether the discreteness of areas and
volumes follows from the kinematics, which embody the equivalence principle, or requires
the Hamiltonian constraint, i.e. the Einstein equations: because the discreteness of areas
may be used to establish the proportionality between area and entropy [14], and this relation
can be used to derive the Einstein equations themselves, understood as equations of state
[15].

IV. CONCLUSION

We have seen that one can formulate canonical gravity as either a SL(2, C) or an SU(2)
connection theory, but that in the latter case an arbitrary parameter β occurs in the basic
Poisson brackets; at the same time, present mathematical technics can only cope with a
quantum theory based on the group SU(2). However, no meaningful result on the spectra
of operators can be obtained unless we either fix this parameter, or learn how to handle a
theory based on the group SL(2, C).
