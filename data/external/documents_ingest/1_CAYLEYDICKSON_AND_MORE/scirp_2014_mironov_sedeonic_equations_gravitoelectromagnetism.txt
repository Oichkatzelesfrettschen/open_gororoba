Abstract
In present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of space-time algebra
of sixteen-component sedeons. The generalized sedeonic second-order equation for unified gravito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism is
proposed. The relations for the GE field energy, momentum and Lorentz invariants are derived.
The special case of GE field described by first-order sedeonic wave equation is also discussed.

1. Introduction
The analogy between electromagnetic and gravitational fields was discussed by many researchers starting from J.
C. Maxwell and O. Heaviside [1] [2]. This analogy motivated many attempts to reformulate the equations of
Newtonian gravitation in the form similar to the Maxwell equations in electrodynamics. Such approach is based
on two general assumptions. First is the existence of gravitomagnetic field connected with moving masses.
Second is the hypothesis that the speed of gravitational field propagation is equal to the speed of light. These
assumptions enable the formulation of phenomenological Maxwell-like equations for gravitational field [3] [4].
On the other hand, recently it was shown that linearized weak field equations of general relativity [5]-[9] can be
represented as the set of Maxwell-like equations for the vectorial gravitational field and now this linear approximation (so-called “post-Newtonian approximation”) is widely used in astrophysics for the analysis of interactions between moving and spinning masses [8]-[13]. However, the Heaviside-Gibbs vector algebra, which is
usually used for the formulation of electromagnetism and linear gravity, does not adequately specify the spacetime properties of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Since the Maxwell equations are the system of four
equations for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and pseudovector values, the application of multi-component algebras

is more appropriate. There are different approaches based on algebra of hypercomplex numbers and Clifford algebras to formulate electromagnetism [14]-[20] and linear gravity [21]-[23] taking into account above mentioned space symmetry. However, the consideration of total relativistic space-time field’s symmetry requires the
introduction of sixteen-component space-time values. There are some attempts to develop a field theory on the
basis of sixteen-component structures such as hypercomplex sedenions [24]-[27] and hypercomplex multivectors generating associative space-time Clifford algebras [28] [29]. Recently S. Demir and M. Tanisli [27] reported the compactification of the linear field equations for gravitational and electromagnetic fields on the basis
of conic sedenions. They have shown that formally electromagnetism and gravity can be described by single
unified equation for the conic sedenionic potentials. However, the sedenions is nonassociative algebra that leads
to the problems in calculating the second-order relations for unified field. Besides, the inclusion of negative
energy and negative Pointing vector of gravitational field in a mathematical structure of the unified field equation was not considered.
Recently we proposed the sixteen-component associative space-time algebra of scalar-vector objects named
by sedeons [30]. The sedeons have the clearly defined geometric meaning, take into account the symmetry of
physical values to the space-time inversion and realize the scalar-vector representation of Poincare group. In
present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of sedeonic potentials. We show that
sedeonic approach enables the introduction of unified sedeonic gravito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing
simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism.

2. Linear Equations of Gravitation in Flat Space-Time
In this section we reproduce the arguments leading to the linear equations of the weak gravitational field. As is
well known [6], Einstein’s equation for gravitational field is written as
Rαβ −

where Rαβ is Ricci curvature tensor, gαβ is metric tensor, c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational
constant, Tαβ is the tensor of energy-momentum of matter (Greek indexes are 0, 1, 2, 3, Latin indexes are 1, 2,
3). In linear approximation [6]-[9] this equation has the following form
 1 ∂2

where hαβ is the deviation from Minkovski metric tensor ηαβ defined as

3. Symmetry of Electrical and Gravitational Charges
It is known that Coulomb’s law for the force of electrical interaction between two charged point bodies is written as follows:

q q 
Fe12 = e1 3 e 2 r12 ,
(11)
r12

where qe1 and qe 2 are electrical charges, r12 is a vector directed from body 1 to body 2, r12 is the separa
tion between point bodies, which is equal to modulus of r12 . For a symmetric description of electromagnetic
and gravitational phenomena, we introduce the gravitational charge qg (considered previously in [3] and [31])
as
qg = Gm ,

(12)

where m is a mass of gravitating body. Then Newton’s law for gravitational force between two point bodies
can be written in the form of Coulomb’s law:

qg1qg 2 
(13)
Fg12 = − 3 r12 .
r12
Simultaneous consideration of gravitational and electric fields leads us to another symmetry connected with
charge conjugation. The idea consists in an introduction of two additional units associated with electrical and
gravitational charges. First one is electrical unit ε e , which is changed (in sign) under electrical charge conjugation. Second one is gravitational unit ε g , which is changed (in sign) under gravitational charge conjugation.
Since in the classical gravitoelectrodynamics there is no direct interaction between gravitational and electrical
charges, the rules of multiplication for units ε e and ε g should be chosen in accordance with Table 1. Besides,
we suppose the anticommutativity of these units and assume that the priority of commutation is higher than multiplication, so that

εe ε g εe −
=
ε g εe εe −
=
εg .

(14)

Following this approach, the generalized gravito-electromagnetic charge Q can be presented as

=
Q ε e qe − iε g qg

and generalized Newton-Coulomb law can be written in the following symmetric form:

Indeed, using (15) and (16) we obtain correct expression for the force between two massive electrically charged

The values a0 , a1 , a 2 , a 3 are scalar-vector basis, where the value a0 ≡ 1 is absolute scalar unit and the
values a1 , a 2 , a 3 are absolute unit vectors generating the right Cartesian basis. The values e0 , et , er , etr
are space-time scalar units, where value e0 ≡ 1 is an absolute scalar unit; e1 = et is a time scalar unit; e 2 = er
is a space scalar unit; e 3 = etr is a space-time scalar unit. The multiplication and commutation rules for sedeonic absolute unit vectors a1 , a 2 , a 3 and space-time units et , er , etr are presented in Table 2 and Table
3 respectively. In the tables and further the value i is the imaginary unit i 2 = −1 . Note that sedeonic units
e1 , e 2 , e 3 and unit vectors a1 , a 2 , a 3 generate the anticommutative algebras, but e1 , e 2 , e 3 commute
with a1 , a 2 , a 3 :

The sedeonic formalism enables the representation of gravitational and electromagnetic fields as one unified
gravito-electromagnetic field. Indeed, the sedeonic second-order equation for massless field can be presented in
the following form [30]:

where ϕе , Aе , ϕ g , and Ag are scalar and vector potentials of electromagnetic (index e) and gravitational
(index g) fields. Hereafter we mean that electrical values contain ε e and gravitational values contain ε g units,
but we omit them to simplify farther expressions. Let us also consider the sedeonic source of GE field

where ρe is a volume density
 of electrical charge; je is a density of electrical current; ρ g is a volume density of gravitational charge; jg is a density of gravitational current [3]. Then the sedeonic Equation (22) describes simultaneously electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Performing sedeonic multiplication of operators
in the left part of (22) we get the system of wave equations for the components of GE potential

which is equivalent to the four equations for ϕе , Aе , ϕ g , and Ag . On the other hand, the sedeonic Equation

fields. Indeed, introducing scalar and vector strengths of GE field as

The expressions (54)-(57) and (58)-(61) are the analogs of Poynting theorem and Lorentz invariants relations
for the field, which is described by first-order equation.

5.2. Plane Wave Solution of Sedeonic First-Order Equation
Let us consider the plane wave solution of Equation (50). In this case the potential can be written as:

 =U
 exp −iωt +i k ⋅ r ,
(62)
W
v
v

U v does not depend on
where ω is a frequency, k is an absolute wave vector and the wave amplitude 
coordinates and time. The dependence of the frequency on the wave vector has two branches:

{

( )}

ω± = ±ck ,
(63)

where k is the module of wave vector k . In general, the plane wave solution for the Equation (50) can be
written in the following sedeonic form [30]:

 
 ω±
 =

(64)
W

 is an arbitrary sedeon with constant components. Note that the internal structure of this wave is
where M
v
changed under space and time
 conjugation. Let us analyze the structure of the plane wave (64) in detail. We
suppose that wave vector k is directed along z axis. Then the first-order Equation (50) can be rewritten in the
following equivalent form:

{

1 ∂

Wν′ 0 ,


 c ∂t

Wν′ = iet 
Wv . Using (63) and (64) we can write solution of (65) in the following form:
where 

Indeed, it is simple to check that

S z = + 1 2 , while W ′v− describes “particle” state with spirality S z = −1 2 .

6. Discussion
From a mathematical point of view, the analogy between electromagnetism and weak gravity leads us to integrating these fields into unified equation, which describes the interaction between electrically charged and gravitating bodies.
On the other hand, from a physical point of view, the phenomena of electricity and gravity are absolutely in-

925

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov

separable from each other. Naturally, all electrically charged particles have the masses and consequently they
are involved in both electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Therefore, all processes involving charged
particles should be considered from a unified concept of gravitoelectromagnetism. For example, the electron
transitions between excited and ground states in an atom should be accompanied by simultaneous irradiation
(absorption) of electromagnetic and gravitational waves (gravito-electromagnetic waves), since in these
processes both electric and gravitational interactions of the electron with the atomic nucleus are changed. Also,
the processes of particle-antiparticle pair’s nucleation (or annihilation) should be accompanied by absorption (or
emission) of gravito-electromagnetic waves. At last, any antennas radiate gravito-electromagnetic waves since
an alternating current in the radiating and receiving antennas has both electrical and gravitational components.
Thus, the gravitational waves exist everywhere around us. For the sake of justice, it should be noted that the
energy of gravitational wave’s components is very small and in general all effects of the interaction between
radiation and matter are determined by electromagnetic component.
Furthermore, the concept of gravitational charge allows separating the effects of inertia associated with inertial mass and the effects of gravity associated with gravitational charge of the particles. For example, the quantum sedeonic wave equation [30] for a quantum particle in a gravitational field can be written as
 
 
m0 c   1  ∂ i
m0 c 
 1 ∂ i

 i

 i

iet  − qg ϕ g  − er  ∇ + qg Ag  − ietr
 iet  − qg ϕ g  − er  ∇ + qg Ag  − ietr
ψ

c
 






 c  ∂t 
= 0.
Here the parameter m0 is the inertial rest mass of particle, while qg is the gravitational charge. This opens
the way for the quantum description of gravitational interactions of particles.
Moreover the operation of charge conjugation allows one to describe the particles with opposite gravitational
charges (antimatter [33]) and suppose the repulsive matter-antimatter gravitational interaction.
Finally, we showed that the sedeonic first-order Equation (50) describes massless particles with spin 1/2. We
believe that this equation can be considered for modeling a neutrino field including electromagnetic and gravitational components.
