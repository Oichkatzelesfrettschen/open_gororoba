                            Full Spectrum of Compact Objects
We are sensitive to two
types of compact
objects: neutron stars
and black holes

Three types of mergers:
binary neutron star,
binary black hole,
neutron star - black hole

Fundamental Questions:
  ●  Which types of
     mergers are we
     seeing?
  ●  How many are
     happening in the
     Universe?


                                                               14
Full Spectrum of Compact Objects
●   Models spanning the full spectrum of compact objects allow us to
     ○   Search for a feature between neutron stars and black holes
     ○   Find relative rates of mergers in different parts of the spectrum
     ○   Include ambiguously classiﬁed events

                            Analysis

Previous analyses were
agnostic about evolution
of the BBH merger rate

We now conﬁdently
conclude that the merger
rate rises into the past

Result driven by new data
and improved estimates
of search sensitivities

No evidence that mass
varies with redshift

Takeaways so far
●   Growing catalog gives us deeper insight into each event

●   Features in the population can teach us astrophysical lessons

●   We make the ﬁrst self-consistent measurement of the merger rate of
    compact binaries across all masses

●   Starting to resolve transition between neutron stars and black holes,
    which allows us to classify the two types of objects
