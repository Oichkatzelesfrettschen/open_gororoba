1. Introduction

    String theory is a generalization of gauge theory. Historically, understanding the
importance of general covariance and local isotopic-spin invariance were crucial steps in the
formulation of general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. One might therefore suspect that
a complete formulation of string theory will be predicated upon a deeper understanding
of the symmetries in the theory.
    In [1] D. Gross proposed that one useful tool for discovering fundamental string sym-
metries is the analysis of the high energy behavior of string scattering amplitudes. In field
theories of spontaneously broken gauge invariance this technique works very well. Using
the saddle-point analysis of [2] Gross derived an infinite set of linear relations between
bosonic string 4-particle S-matrix amplitudes. Usually linear relations between scattering
amplitudes are derived from an underlying symmetry, and it was suggested in [1] that such
a symmetry must explain these linear relations. Some work has subsequently been done
with a view towards understanding this mysterious symmetry in [3] [4] [5].
    In [6] it was suggested that the infinite dimensional hyperbolic symmetries which arise
upon toroidal compactification of time might be the source of the high energy symmetries
of string theory. The original program of [6] is probably misguided, for reasons explained
in appendix B below. Nevertheless, as we show in the present paper, the basic idea that
generalized Kac-Moody algebras are high-energy symmetries of string theory is correct. In
fact, more is true. We can replace high energy Ward identities, which relate amplitudes
at the same values of s, t by finite difference relations for the exact amplitudes. These
finite difference relations put strong constraints on the genus zero string S-matrix. We
will show that they determine scattering amplitudes at all mass levels in terms of tachyon
scattering. Moreover, when supplemented with some mild analyticity requirements (e.g.
Regge-like behavior at s → ∞) the finite difference relations even determine the tachyon
amplitude itself. A technical point discussed in section 3.3 limits our discussion to N -
particle scattering for N ≤ 26.
    In essence the answer to the problem posed in [1] is very simple: the underlying
symmetries are the bracket algebras defined by on-shell mutually local BRST invariant
chiral vertex operators.


2. Review of Bosonic String Scattering

    It is convenient to summarize some standard facts [7].

                                             1
2.1. On-Shell States

         The states of the open bosonic string are defined in terms of the BRST cohomology
H ∗ [7][8]. We focus on the chiral ghost number 1 cohomology, H = H g=1 . The space H is
graded by level number n and momentum p ∈ IR25,1 :
                                       Z
                            H = ⊕n∈ZZ+      dp H[p, n]                                            (2.1)
                                                    IR25,1

where H[p, n] = 0 unless p2 = 2 − 2n and dim H[p, n] = p24 (n). H is an induced represen-
tation of the Poincaré group in IR25,1 .
         Cohomology classes have representatives of the form cV where V is a chiral vertex
operator satisfying the physical state conditions. These conditions state that V is a di-
mension one Virasoro primary. 1 Such operators have the form V = PeipX where P is a
polynomial in ∂ ∗ X of dimension n. For example:

                        n=0:        P =1
                        n=1:        P = iζ · ∂X          ζ ∈ T IR25,1
                                    ζ ·p=0         ζ ∼ ζ + λp                                     (2.2)
                                                                                     25,1 ⊗2
                                     P = ip · ζ · ∂ 2 X + ∂X · ζ · ∂X
                                                                                         
                        n=2:                                            ζ ∈ T IR
                                                                      1
                                         ζ ∼ ζ + 21 p ⊗ χ + χ ⊗ p − (p · χ)η
                                                                            
               tr(ζ) − 2p · ζ · p = 0

The fields X µ are always normalized to have the correlator

                                                                η µν
                                  ∂X µ (z)∂X ν (w) ∼ −                  .
                                                             (z − w)2

We use units where α′ = 21 for open string amplitudes. Polarization tensors, or multiplets
of polarization tensors are generically denoted by ζ.

2.2. S-Matrix Amplitudes

         S-matrix amplitudes are multilinear functions A : H⊗n → C constructed as follows.
The operator formalism associates a measure Ω(V1 , . . . Vn ) on the moduli space F of ordered
                                                            R
points on the boundary of the unit disk. We define A = F Ω. By Mobius invariance of Ω,
A is invariant under cyclic permutations.
     1
         The ghosts will not play an essential role in this paper so we will often identify a class with
V.

                                                     2
                           R
     The definition of      F
                                Ω requires some care. Using Mobius invariance of Ω we transform
the disk to the upper half plane and write:
                                     Z              n−2
                                                    Y
                               n−2
        A(V1 , . . . Vn ) = κ                             dyi h0|Vn (yn )Vn−1 (yn−1 ) · · · V1 (y1 )|0i   (2.3)
                                     Fn−3 ([0,1])    2

where yn = ∞, yn−1 = 1, y1 = 0 and Fn−3 ([0, 1]) is the moduli space of n−3 ordered points
on the interval. The integral (2.3) is given meaning as follows. The integrand is a function
of the yi and of the relativistic invariants sij ≡ pi · pj . It follows from the o.p.e. that there
is a domain where Re(sij ) is sufficiently large and positive, or negative, (depending on ij)
so that the integral is absolutely convergent and defines a holomorphic function of the sij .
The analytic continuation from this domain defines an amplitude which is a meromorphic
function of the sij .
     It will be important to specify clearly the independent relativistic invariants that A
depends upon. These invariants are formed out of momenta pi and polarization tensors
ζi . Relativistic invariants formed from the pi alone parametrize the different orbits of
SO(1, d − 1) on the space of n − 1 independent momenta. Taking into consideration the
relevant little group we see that the number of independent relativistic invariants for n
particle scattering in d dimensions is

                                nd − 12 d(d + 1)                   for   n≥d+1
                                                                                                          (2.4)
                                         1
                                         2
                                           n(n − 1)                for   n≤d+1

For n ≤ d a set of algebraically independent invariants can be chosen to be an ap-
propriate collection of the sij .           For example, we may choose sij for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤
n − 1. (We make a different choice below.) For n ≥ d + 1 the story is more com-
plicated. By classical invariant theory [9] the ring of polynomial invariants is gener-
ated by the sij and by [pi1 , . . . , pid ] = ǫµ1 ···µd piµ11 · · · piµdd . The relations are generated
by [pi1 , . . . , pid ][pj1 , . . . , pjd ] = dets,t pis · pjt , det ∆ = 0 where ∆ is any (d + 1)-dimensional
minor of the matrix (sij ), and σ ±[piσ(1) , . . . , piσ(d) ]piσ(d+1) ·pj = 0 [10]. Thus for n ≥ d+1
                                             P

a maximal algebraically independent set of invariants can be taken to be an appropriate
set of sij together with [p1 , . . . , pd ].
     We separate the independent relativistic invariants into three types:
• Levels of the particles: p2i = 2 − 2ni , i = 1, . . . n
• Scalar product invariants. According to the above discussion for n ≤ d these can be
taken to be the sij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2, together with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3, j = n − 1 . For
n ≥ d + 1 we must choose an appropriate set of n(d − 1) − 21 d(d + 1) − 1 sij ’s.

                                                            3
• Polarization invariants. These are formed from contractions of the ζ’s with themselves or

the ζ’s with p’s. The only way the relativistic invariants [pi1 , . . . , pid ] can enter a (bosonic)

string amplitude is through the polarization invariants.

      Example: The case n = 4 is of particular importance. This is the function A :

H⊗4 → C given by:

                                                  Z 1
                                              2
                   A(V1 , V2 , V3 , V4 ) = κ            dzh0|V4 (∞)V3 (1)V2 (z)V1 (0)|0i       (2.5)
                                                   0


The kinematic invariants are s = p1 · p2 , t = p2 · p3 . We let

stand for an ordered set of independent polarization invariants. 2 Thus,the amplitudes are

functions with independent arguments:

2.3. Analyticity Properties


      As an analytic function A is a polynomial in the polarization invariants. The coeffi-

cients of this polynomial are meromorphic functions of the sij . One of the goals of this

paper is to replace the complicated formula (2.3) by a symmetry principle. We will need

to take the following three analyticity properties as axiomatic:

AP1: Location of poles. The dual diagrams of the genus zero open string amplitudes are

binary trees rooted at the center of the unit disk with ordered terminal vertices on the

boundary of the disk as in:

     Each terminal vertex carries an ingoing momentum pi . Using momentum conservation
we associate a momentum pI with each internal edge I. We assume that the amplitudes can
only have poles when p2I ∈ {2, 0, −2, −4, . . .} for some I in some dual diagram. Explicitly,
this is the condition that (pi + · · · + pi+k )2 ∈ {2, 0, −2, −4, . . .} for some i, k, where indices
are understood modulo n.
     The proof that the n-point amplitudes (2.3) satisfy the axiom AP1 makes use of the
operator product expansion and Mobius invariance of Ω.
AP2: Growth at infinity. We assume that the amplitude has at most power law growth
as any sij tends to infinity, holding all other independent kinematic invariants fixed. This
is a generalization of Regge behavior.
     The axiom AP2 can be motivated by considering the n-tachyon scattering amplitude:
                                  Z 1 n−2
                                      Y                                  Y
                   A=κ    n−2

where yn−1 = 1, y1 = 0. The standard argument [11] proceeds as follows. If Re(sij ) → +∞
then since all the factors in the product in (2.8) are ≤ 1 the integration is dominated by
the region where those factors raised to a power sij are near one. Making an exponential
change of variables and isolating this region proves the claim. As the simplest example

                                                       5
of this argument, suppose we take the sij appearing in (2.8) as independent variables
(s1,n−1 will be considered dependent). Consider the limit Re(s12 ) → +∞ holding all other
independent sij fixed. We write y2 = e−x2 and the integral is dominated by the region
x2 ∼ 0. Making this approximation in the rest of the integrand we find the asymptotics

where β is a combination of the other skl ’s. This argument extends to any correlation
function and justifies the axiom AP2.
      Finally we need an axiom that relates the amplitudes for different values of n. These
are the well-known and standard tree-level unitarity equations:
AP3: Factorization. If we cut a dual diagram on some internal edge I we decompose it
into two dual diagrams I1 , I2 . We assume that when p2I → 2 − 2nI and other momenta are
in general position the residue at the pole is

                             A(Vi , . . . , Vi+k , Va )Gab A(Vb , Vi+k+1 , . . . , Vi−1 )   (2.9)
                       a,b


where {Va } is a basis for H[pI , nI ] and Gab is the inverse of the positive definite metric on
H[pI , nI ] whose existence is assured by the no-ghost theorem.
      The proof that property AP3 is satisfied again makes use of the operator product
expansion.
      Remark: In stating the factorization axiom we have not made any use of a complex
structure or of local coordinates on the disk. One could state a stronger factorization
axiom valid for all values of the momenta. This requires the introduction of the full off-
shell BRST chain complex and the introduction of local coordinates. We will not need
that in the present paper.


2.4. High Energy-Fixed Angle Scattering

      We define s = p1 ·p2 ≡ −2E 2 , and t = p2 ·p3 ≡ 2E 2 sin2 12 θ. In the limit of high energy
scattering, where all masses are effectively zero, E and θ have the physical interpretation of
center of mass energy and scattering angle. In the plane of scattering the spatial momenta
look like:

      The high energy limit is defined to be the limit where E 2 → ∞ along any ray other
than the positive or negative real axis, holding θ and all other independent relativistic
invariants fixed. 3

      The proof of (2.10) may be obtained by combining Stirling’s formula with the analytic
structure of the amplitudes described above. Alternatively, one may use a saddle point
analysis of either the integral over moduli space or of the path integral. The saddle point
typically lies outside the domain of integration, and for good reason. The true high energy
asymptotics obtained by taking E 2 → ∞ along the positive real axis must encounter an
infinite set of poles when any intermediate state goes onshell. These poles are manifestly
absent from (2.10). The saddle point analysis applies to the asymptotics of analytically
continued S-matrix elements. This is important to bear in mind when considering gener-
alizations to n ≥ 5 point functions and to higher orders of string perturbation theory, in
which case one probably must consider asymptotics only for E 2 → ±i∞.

      Warning: this differs slightly from the α′ → ∞ limit of [1], since we hold expressions of the
form ζ · pk constant, even for polarizations with longitudinal components.
  4
      The result is BRST invariant despite appearances. The choice of the point z0 magically
cancels all differences arising from different choices of representative P for the cohomology class.

3. Bracket Relations

3.1. Bracket

      Two years ago it was shown that the BRST cohomology of 2D string theory has
a rich algebraic structure related to BV quantization [12] [13] [14]. Subsequently, Lian
and Zuckerman studied the algebraic structures of the BRST cohomology based on an
arbitrary chiral algebra (=vertex operator algebra [15]) in [16] [17]. As shown by Lian and
Zuckerman, there is an operation {·, ·} : H g1 × H g2 → H g1 +g2 −1 which they called the
“Gerstenhaber bracket.” The bracket is very fundamental: it exists for arbitrary bosonic
string cohomology and plays a role related to the BV anti-bracket for the on-shell BV
structure of string theory. In the present case we may identify ghost number 1 classes with
chiral physical state operators and the bracket is simply the standard “commutator” of
dimension one currents:
                                                       I
                              J ⊗ V → {J, V }(z) ≡          dwJ(w)V (z)                        (3.1)
                                                        z

In general, the ghost number one cohomology based on a chiral algebra is a Lie algebra.
      In our case H in (2.1) is not based on a chiral algebra because the fields have mon-
odromy when considered as chiral vertex operators. Nevertheless, when J, V are mutually
local (3.1) still makes sense. 5 In particular, given two momenta p, q with q 2 = 2 − 2n1 ,
p2 = 2 − 2n2 , (p + q)2 = 2 − 2n3 . we have a map:

                            {·, ·} : H[q, n1 ] ⊗ H[p, n2 ] → H[p + q, n3 ]

We may extend the bracket to all of H:

                                        {·, ·} : H ⊗ H → H

by defining it to be zero on pairs not mutually local. 6
      The bracket has the two properties:
      B1. If p1 , p2 are the momenta of V1 , V2 then:

                                  {V1 , V2 } = −(−1)p1 ·p2 {V2 , V1 }
  5
      In this paper “mutually local” means the o.p.e. has only integral powers of z − w. Equiva-
lently, the monodromy is trivial (although the braiding matrix could be (−1)).
  6
      Alternatively, one can take the point of view that the bracket is only defined on some pairs of
states. That is, it is like multiplication in a groupoid, or composition of morphisms in a category.

                                                  8
       B2. If V1 , V2 , V3 are all pairwise mutually local then:

      (−1)p1 ·p3 {V1 , {V2 , V3 }} + (−1)p3 ·p2 {V3 , {V1 , V2 }} + (−1)p2 ·p1 {V2 , {V3 , V1 }} = 0   (3.2)

       Unfortunately (3.2) does not hold for all triples in H.
       The bracket on ghost number one cohomology generalizes the Lie algebra of the Ger-
stenhaber bracket in two ways. First, property B1 shows that the bracket is “vectorially-
graded.” Second, the vectorially-graded Jacobi relation only holds for mutually local
triples.
       A table of useful structure constants for {·, ·} can be found in appendix A.

3.2. Relations

     Let J be any chiral physical state operator of momentum q and let Vi , i = 1, 2, 3, 4 be
                                                           P
chiral physical state operators of momenta pi such that q + pi = 0. Assume that q · pi
are integral so that J and Vi are mutually local. 7 In this case we can regard the integrand
of (2.5) as a correlator of chiral vertex operators for conformal field theory on the plane.
Using standard contour deformation arguments we derive the identity

                        0 = h0|V4 (∞)V3 (1)V2 (z){J, V1 }(0)|0i
                       +(−1)q·p2 h0|V4 (∞)V3 (1){J, V2 }(z)V1 (0)|0i
                                                                                                       (3.3)
                       +(−1)q·p2 +q·p3 h0|V4 (∞){J, V3 }(1)V2 (z)V1 (0)|0i

       Now we simply integrate z from 0 to 1, assuming that Re(s) and Re(t) are sufficiently
positive that the integral is absolutely convergent. This gives the finite difference relations:

        We do not assume that the Vi are mutually local.

Here ñ, ζ̃ refer to the transformed operator under the bracket.
    The relations (3.4) are finite difference equations relating scattering amplitudes for
particles at different mass levels. The essential content of these identities is displayed by a
matrix of the levels of the states involved. Each row of the matrix encodes the level-number
of the states in an amplitude. The general Ward identity is associated with a matrix of
the form:
                                          ñ1    n2         n3    n4
                                                                     
                                         n1     ñ2        n3    n4 
                                                                                          (3.5)
                                          n1     n2         ñ3   n4
                                                                     
                                          n1     n2         n3    ñ4
Here integers ni ≥ 0, are levels of the untransformed particles, while the integers ñi are
the levels of the transformed particles. The level nJ of the symmetry current J is easily
extracted from the sum of the diagonal minus the anti-diagonal:
                                 X           X
                                     ñi −       ni = −q 2 = 2nJ − 2                      (3.6)

If ñi is negative then {J, V } = 0 and the corresponding amplitude simply vanishes.
   This procedure generalizes to N -particle scattering. Whenever J of momentum q is
                                       P
mutually local w.r.t all the pi and q + pi = 0 we have an identity
                      X
                            (−1)q·p2 +···q·pi A V1 , . . . , {J, Vi }, . . . VN = 0
                                                                               
                                                                                          (3.7)
                        i

These relations are subject to an important technical restriction discussed in the next
section.
    Remark: Although we have used currents J to derive relations on amplitudes, they
are not unbroken symmetry currents in the theory since there are many operators in the
BRST cohomology which are not mutually local w.r.t. any given J. Nevertheless, using
Lorentz invariance and analyticity we are still able to derive relations on amplitudes.

3.3. Existence of required momenta

    The identities (3.4) would be of little use if one could rarely choose momenta in the way
we have indicated. In this section we show that we can always find momenta corresponding
to any prescription of the levels and kinematic invariants (at least, for N ≤ d = 26). In
doing so it is necessary to allow the momenta to be complex. We may do this since the
BRST conditions and the vertex operator calculus make perfect sense when momenta are
complex.

      Proof: For N ≤ d the invariants sij made from N momenta pi are algebraically
independent. It is straightforward to solve (3.8 )as a linear system of equations to find the
pi · pj in terms of linear combinations of the ni , ñi , zij . We can regard the equations for
pi · pj as equations for the intersection of 21 N (N + 1) quadrics in IPNd . These intersect in
a variety of codimension at most 12 N (N + 1) [18]. Even if this variety lies at infinity we
can use the solution - we simply must take a momentum → ∞ limit in the amplitudes. ♠
      The different sets of polarization invariants in (3.4) are polynomially related. There-
fore, using the analyticity of A we conclude that (3.4) holds for all values of s, t and
all polarization tensors satisfying these polynomial relations. Similarly, provided ni , nJ
are positive integers and ñi are integers, we can find momenta for arbitrary kinematic
invariants for which the identities (3.7) can be written.
      Unfortunately one cannot generalize the lemma to the case N > d. For N ≥ d + 1
the sij are not algebraically indpendent, hence we cannot specify arbitrarily the ni , ñi and
independent sij , i 6= j (for N -particle scattering).
      We are therefore stuck with the rather distasteful limitation to N -particle scattering
for N ≤ d.

Shifts such as s, t → s + q · p2 , t + q · p3 lead to an order one change in the amplitude from
the exponential factor in (3.10), leading to the “extra” powers of z0 , 1 − z0 in (3.9). The
                                                                                          
change δz0 in the position of the saddle-point in moduli space is O 1/s, 1/t, 1/(s + t) .
Similarly, the shifts in s, t change the rational function R by terms of the same order.
                                                         
Hence (3.9) holds up to factors 1 + O 1/s, 1/t, 1/(s + t) .


4. Six Examples

     Example 1: The simplest example of (3.4) has level matrix:

                                         0   0    0   0
                                                        
                                       0    0    0   0 
                                                                                          (4.1)
                                         0   0    0   0
                                                        
                                         0   0    0   −2

From the entries we read off that this is a “tachyonic identity,” i.e. q 2 = 2. We also can
read off:
                 p2i = 2        p1 · q = p2 · q = p3 · q = −1        p4 · q = +1

Using (A.1) of appendix A we see that (3.4) implies

                           A(s − 1, t) + A(s, t − 1) = A(s − 1, t − 1)                    (4.2)

where A is the basic Veneziano amplitude A0000 = A(s, t) for scattering of four states at
level 0.
     Example 2: Consider the level matrix:

                                         1   0    0   0
                                                        
                                       0    0    0   0 
                                                                                          (4.3)
                                         0   0    0   0
                                                        
                                         0   0    0   −1

                                                 12
This encodes a lightlike Ward identity with J = iζ1 · ∂Xeiq·X and q 2 = 0. It relates γT T T
scattering to T T T T scattering, where γ refers to the level one photon and T refers to the
level zero tachyon. For the γT T T amplitude (2.7) simplifies to:

                                         A1000 (ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 · p3 |s, t)

From (4.3) we read off

                                                 p21 = p22 =p23 = p24 = 2
                            p1 · q = −1 p2 · q = p3 · q = 0 p4 · q = +1

Using (A.3) we have:

                  A1000 (ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 · p3 |s, t) = −ζ1 · p2 A(s − 1, t) − ζ1 · p3 A(s, t)           (4.4)

From (3.9) we see that at high energies γT T T scattering is related to tachyon scattering
via

       0 = As.p.
            1000 (ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 · p3 |s, t) + (1 + t/s)ζ1 · p2 A
                                                                s.p.
                                                                     (s, t) + ζ1 · p3 As.p. (s, t)   (4.5)

      Similarly, one easily derives relations on similar amplitudes. For example:

                A0100 (ζ2 · p1 , ζ2 · p3 |s, t) = ζ2 · p1 A(s − 1, t) − ζ2 · p3 A(s, t − 1)          (4.6)

      Example 3: We now consider the level matrix
                                   1 1 0 0
                                                
                                 0 1 0 0 
                                                                                                     (4.7)
                                   0 1 0 0
                                                
                                   0 1 0 −1
again giving a lightlike Ward identity. This relates γγT T to γT T T scattering.
      We consider the γγT T amplitude to be a function of seven arguments:

                           A1100 (ζ1 · ζ2 , ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 · p3 , ζ2 · p1 , ζ2 · p3 |s, t)

Using (A.3) and (A.5) (3.4) becomes (after shifting arguments and setting ζ2 · q = 0):

               A1100 (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 |s, t) = −A0100 (x2 x4 − x1 , x2 x5 |s − 1, t)
                                                      − x3 A0100 (x4 , x5 , s, t)
                                                                                                     (4.8)
                = (x1 − x2 x4 )A(s − 2, t)+x2 x5 A(s − 1, t − 1) − x3 x4 A(s − 1, t)
                                                   + x3 x5 A(s, t − 1)

                                                       13
Which has the high energy limit:

                 As.p.                                             s.p.
                  1100 (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 |s, t) = −(1 + t/s)A0100 (x2 x4 − x1 , x2 x5 |s, t)
                                                                                                                            (4.9)
                                                                   − x3 As.p.
                                                                         0100 (x4 , x5 |s, t)


      Notice that if we were restricted to using real momenta and polarizations then p2 =
q 2 = p · q = 0 ⇒ p k q and we would not derive relations on the most general amplitude
(e.g. s would be fixed). This is not true if we use complex momenta. After we derive the
Ward identity we can specialize to physical values of the relativistic invariants, and, as in
(4.9), solve for the amplitude in terms of previously known amplitudes.
      Example 4: We now consider

                                                      1      1     0       0
                                                                             
                                                    1       1     0       0 
                                                                                                                          (4.10)
                                                      1      1     1       0
                                                                             
                                                      1      1     0       −1

which will express A1110 in terms of amplitudes at lower total level. The ordered set of
relativistic invariants in A1110 is:
                           
     ζ1     ζ2    ζ3   1
                                = {ζ1 · ζ2 , ζ1 · ζ3 , ζ2 · ζ3 , ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 · p3 , ζ2 · p1 , ζ2 · p3 , ζ3 · p1 , ζ3 · p2 } (4.11)
     p1     p2    p3   p4

      Following the procedure of the previous two examples we get:

          A1110 (x1 , . . . , x9 |s, t) = A1100 (x1 x8 , x4 x8 , x5 x8 − x2 , x6 , x7 |s, t)
                                                                                                                          (4.12)
                                              + A1100 (x1 x9 , x4 , x5 , x6 x9 , x7 x9 − x3 |s, t − 1)

which has the high energy limit:

     As.p.                            s.p.
      1110 (x1 , . . . , x9 |s, t) = A1100 (x1 x8 , x4 x8 , x5 x8 − x2 , x6 , x7 |s, t)
                                                                                                                          (4.13)

      Example 5: We take
                                                        1     1        1   0

                                                      1      1        1   0

                                                        1     1        0   0

                                                        1     1        1   1
which will relate the 4-photon amplitude to the tachyon amplitude. We now need the
bracket (A.4)

                                                                  14
    The ordered set of relativistic invariants occurring in A1111 is:
                    
      ζ1 ζ2 ζ3 ζ4
                        = {ζ1 · ζ2 ,ζ1 · ζ3 , ζ1 · ζ4 , ζ2 · ζ3 , ζ2 · ζ4 , ζ3 · ζ4 ,
      p1 p2 p3 p4                                                                                                (4.15)
                                ζ1 · p2 , ζ1 ·p3 , ζ2 · p1 , ζ2 · p3 , ζ3 · p1 , ζ3 · p2 , ζ4 · p1 , ζ4 · p2 }

So the four-photon amplitude is a function of 16 arguments, and (3.4) becomes

     A1111 (x1 , . . . ,, x14 |s, t)
            = −A1110 (x1 x13 , x2 x13 , x4 , x7 x13 , x8 x13 + x3 , x9 , x10 , x11 , x12 |s, t)

with high energy limit:

         1111 (x1 , . . . ,, x14 |s, t)

            = −As.p.
                 1110 (x1 x13 , x2 x13 , x4 , x7 x13 , x8 x13 + x3 , x9 , x10 , x11 , x12 |s, t)

       −        As.p. (x1 x14 , x2 , x4 x14 , x7 , x8 , x9 x14 , x10 x14 + x5 , x11 , x12 |s, t)
         (s + t) 1110
               +x6 As.p.
                    1100 (x1 , x7 , x8 , x9 , x10 |s, t)

    Example 6: As a final example we look at a timelike identity with level matrix:
                                   2 0 0 0
                                              
                                 0 0 0 0
                                                                                 (4.18)
                                   0 0 0 0
                                              
                                   0 0 0 0

We parametrize the scattering of 1 level 2 on 3 level 0 states by the function of 8 variables:

        A2000 (p1 · ζ · p1 , p1 · ζ · p2 , p1 · ζ · p3 , p2 · ζ · p2 , p2 · ζ · p3 , p3 · ζ · p3 |s, t)          (4.20)

Now we use the bracket in (A.6). After shifting arguments a little one finds the bracket
relation:
   A2000 (p1 · ζ · p1 , . . . p3 · ζ · p3 |s, t) = −(p2 · ζ · p2 + p1 · ζ · p2 )A(s − 2, t + 1)

    As an exercise the reader may care to work out some futuristic identities for A2001 .


5. Determination of Tachyon Amplitudes

    In the previous section we saw that the relations (3.4) lead to a host of interlevel
amplitude identities. In the present section we discuss finite difference relations on the
tachyon amplitudes themselves. We show that relations (3.4)(3.7) together with the an-
alyticity properties AP1,AP2 determine the N - tachyon scattering amplitudes up to an
overall constant cN .

5.1. Derivation of the Veneziano formula

    Example one of the previous section has already produced one identity on the tachyon
scattering amplitude A(s, t). The relation (4.2) by itself is not sufficiently strong to de-
termine the function A. However, we can combine it with (4.6) using the decoupling of
BRST trivial states. Decoupling of the longitudinal photon implies that A0100 (s, t|s, t) = 0.
Combining this with (4.6) we get

                                       sA(s − 1, t) = tA(s, t − 1)                                        (5.1)

Now the recursion relations (4.2) and (5.1) determine the value of A for s, t ∈ ZZ+ to be
given by the Veneziano formula:

                                                           Γ(s + 1)Γ(t + 1)
                                A0000 = A(s, t) = c4                                                      (5.2)
                                                             Γ(s + t + 2)

where c4 = A(0, 0) is assumed nonzero.
    In order to obtain the amplitude for all s, t we must “analytically continue from the
integers,” an idea familiar from studies of the S-matrix in D = 2 spacetime dimensions.
(For reviews see [19]. ) It is at this point that we must invoke the analyticity properties
AP1,AP2 of section 2.3.

                                                      16
    Let us define
                                                        Γ(s + 1)Γ(t + 1)
                                      A(s, t) = c4                       Ã(s, t)                                       (5.3)
                                                          Γ(s + t + 2)
The functional equations for A imply that Ã(s, t) is periodic of period one in both s, t.
Moreover, by AP1 it is an entire function. By AP2, the entire function Ã is of expo-
nential type [20]. A periodic entire function of exponential type must be a trigonometric
polynomial [20], that is:
                                                         X
                                          Ã(s, t) =           cn,m e2πi(ns+mt)
                                                         n,m

where the sum is finite. Now applying AP2 again we see that Ã must in fact be constant,
so Ã = 1.
    In conclusion, with a mild analyticity assumption we see that the Veneziano amplitude
is fixed by symmetry.

5.2. n-particle scattering, n ≤ 26

    The above procedure can be extended to higher point functions, although the amount
of work involved goes up rapidly with n. We take the independent kinematic variables to
be sij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2 and si,n−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. The equation
                                                                  X

                                                              1≤i<j≤n−1

expresses sn−2,n−1 in terms of the other invariants. It is often useful to think of the
variables as an upper triangular matrix:

                                  .

                                                                                        
                                s=                                                                                    (5.5)
                                  0           ···      ∗      sn−3,n−2        sn−3,n−1 
                                                                                       
                                    0          ···                ∗            sn−2,n−1
                                                                                       
                                    0          ···      0         0               ∗

where sn−2,n−1 is not an independent variable but is fixed by (5.4).
    The tachyon amplitudes are functions on the space of upper triangular matrices (5.5)
defined by (2.8).
    The generalization of (4.2) is

     A(. . . , sab , . . . , sac , . . . , sbc , . . .) =A(. . . , (sab − 1), . . . , (sac + 1), . . . , sbc , . . .)
                                                                                                                        (5.6)
                     −A(. . . , (sab − 1), . . . ,(sac ), . . . , (sbc + 1), . . .)

                                                               17
which holds ∀a, b, c such that 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ n − 1 where all other variables in the ellipsis
are held fixed. We call these “triangle relations” since they relate a triangle of variables in
(5.5).
     Using the triangle relations one easily reduces an arbitrary tachyon amplitude for
sij ∈ ZZ+ , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2 to the case where:
                                         ∗        0       0    ··· 0      s1,n−1    

We denote a tachyon amplitude evaluated for such a set of invariants by the function
F (s1,n−1 , . . . sn−3,n−1 ).
     Next, one may write lightlike relations connecting A0···010···0 to tachyon scattering.
As above, one can put A0···010···0 to zero by evaluating at special polarization invariants
corresponding to longitudinal photons. In this way we obtain a set of n − 1 relations for
the function F . These equations are:

    As we will show below, these equations are sufficient to determine the functional
dependence of F for sij ∈ ZZ, up to a finite set of arbitrary constants. The remaining
undetermined constants can be fixed (up to one overall scale) by use of the axiom AP1.
We illustrate this by giving the general solution to the functional equations (5.7)(5.8)(5.9)
for the case of the 5-particle function. We then give the general argument.

    The functional equations become

               (x + y + 2)F (x, y) = xF (x − 1, y) + yF (x, y − 1)

    The equations must be evaluated in the quadrant x = −2 − a, y = −2 − b, a, b ≥ 0,
otherwise the amplitude might have poles. The general solution to (5.10) in this quadrant
is easily found to be

where α, β are undetermined. By AP1 we only allow poles in x or in x + y ( since y itself
is not related to the squared momentum in any channel). This requirement fixes 3α = 4β
so that
                                                         1

    3 F2 −s13 , −1 − s12 − s13 − s14 , 1 + s34 ; −s13 − s14 ,2 + s23 + s34 1


where s34 is defined by (5.4).
        Equation (5.13) is derived for integral values of sij . In order to “continue” to all values
of sij we must combine results on entire functions with the analyticity property AP2 of
section 2.3, as in the previous section. This is straightforward when s13 = 0. In the
general case we must use a Mellin-Barnes representation for 3 F2 to establish appropriate
asymptotics.
        The formula (5.13) can actually be derived directly from the integral representation
(2.8) using formulae in, e.g., [21]. Similar formulae have appeared in a different context in
[22].

5.4. 6 ≤ n ≤ 26

        The above discussion generalizes to n- particle scattering for 6 ≤ n ≤ 26. The
analyticity property AP1 combined with the functional equation (5.9) is sufficiently strong
to obtain the general formula.
        We now prove this. To begin we use (5.9) with s2 = s3 = · · · = 0:

                                    s1 F (s1 − 1, ~0) = (n − 3 + s1 )F (s1 , ~0)                   (5.14)

which implies
                                                                    c
                                     F (s1 , ~0) =                                                 (5.15)
                                                     (s1 + 1) · · · (s1 + n − 3)
where c is a constant. Now given F (s1 , ~0) we can again use (5.9) to derive
                                                              c1 s1 + c2
                                    F (s1 , 1, ~0) =                                               (5.16)
                                                       (s1 + 1) · · · (s1 + n − 2)
where c1 , c2 are constants. We can carry on in this way and easily establish by induction
that if s2 , s3 , . . . are nonnegative integers then
                                                                  P s2 ,...sn−3 (s1 )
                   F (s1 , s2 , . . . sn−3 ) =                                                     (5.17)
                                                 (s1 + 1) · · · (s1 + s2 + · · · + sn−3 + n − 3)

                                                           20
where P s2 ,...sn−3 (s1 ) is a polynomial of degree s2 + · · · + sn−3 .
     Now, as with the 5pt function we can fix the coefficients of the polynomial by invoking
AP1. By AP1 the function F (~s) can only have poles when

                                                  s1,n−1 ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}
                                        s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}
                           s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 + s3,n−1 ∈ {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, . . .}                   (5.18)
                                             ..                      ..
                                              .                       .
                              s1,n−1 + · · · sn−3,n−1 ∈ {−(n − 3), −(n − 4), . . .}

Therefore, the polynomial in the numerator of (5.17) must cancel the poles:

       s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 1, . . . , −2}
       s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 3, . . . , −s2 − s3 − 2}
           ..                      ..                                                             (5.19)
            .                       .
       s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − · · · − sn−4 − (n − 3), . . . , −s2 − · · · − sn−3 − (n − 4)}

This fixes all the constants in P up to an overall scale and we obtain the result
                                                       n−3
                                                       Y           −1
                                         F (~s) = cn              Pj                              (5.20)
                                                       j=1 j +     ℓ=1 sℓ,n−1

which can also be checked directly from the integral representation (2.8).
     One can proceed from here to evaluate the general tachyon amplitude using the tri-
angle relations and AP2. The result after “putting back” s12 , s23 , . . . sn−3,n−2 is still a
product of gamma functions. The general result is a multiple hypergeometric function of
1
2
  (n − 3)(n − 4) arguments. For example, the six-point function turns out to be:
                X          (−s14 )j1 (−s24 )j2 (−s13 )j3 Γ(−s12 − s13 − s14 − s15 + j1 + j3 )
                                                                                              ×
                                     j1 !j2 !j3 !         Γ(1 − s13 − s14 − s15 + j1 + j3 )
           j1 ,j2 ,j3 ≥0
                                                                                                  (5.21)
     Γ(4 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3 )       Γ(1 + s12 )Γ(1 + s23 )Γ(1 + s34 )
  Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3 ) Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 )

Multiple hypergeometric functions have been studied to some extent in the literature, see,
e.g., [21]. In order to apply AP2 we must give a Mellin-Barnes representation to series
like (5.21) to establish the appropriate asymptotics in sij . We have not carried out this
procedure in complete detail, but fully expect that it can be done.

                                                             21
6. S is unique

    We now argue that the solution to the bracket relations is essentially unique.


6.1. 4-particle S-matrix

    We begin by showing that the identities (3.4) completely fix the 4-particle S-matrix
for all particles in terms of the level zero S-matrix A(s, t). Indeed, this can already be
done simply by using the lightlike Ward identities. The proof of this assertion is a simple
application of the no-ghost theorem and DDF operators [7]. If k0 is a lightlike vector,
p20 = 2, and p0 · k0 = 1 then the bracket


            {iζ · ∂Xe−iℓk0 X ,   ·   } : H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0 , n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0 , n]


is equivalent to applying DDF operators ζ · A−ℓ to H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0 , n − ℓ]. Therefore, the
no-ghost theorem implies that


           {, } : ⊕1≤ℓ≤n H[−ℓk0 , 1] ⊗ H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0 , n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0 , n]      (6.1)


is a surjective map.
    We would like to proceed as in the examples of section four using the Ward identities
to reduce the level-numbers of various states in the amplitude. We use induction on
      P
nT =     ni , the sum of the level numbers of the states in an amplitude. Consider the
lightlike Ward identities of the form

                                     n1     n2        n3   n4
                                                             
                                  n1 − ℓ n2 − ℓ      n3   n4 
                                                                                        (6.2)
                                   n1 − ℓ   n2        n3   n4
                                                             
                                   n1 − ℓ   n2        n3   n4

for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n1 . These identities relate the amplitude encoded by the first row to amplitudes
with smaller values of nT . Since (6.1) is surjective, we can map an arbitrary amplitude,
that is, an amplitude where the level n1 state has an arbitrary polarization, to amplitudes
with smaller total level number.

                                               22
6.2. N -particle scattering

    The above argument generalizes easily to N -particle scattering, using the level matrix

                                  n1     n2         n3     . . . nN
                                                                    
                               n1 − ℓ n2 − ℓ       n3     . . . nN 
                               .                   ..            .. 
                               .                      .                                   (6.3)
                               .                                  . 
                                                                     
                              n −ℓ      n2         n3     ... n 
                                 1                               N
                                n1 − ℓ   n2         n3     . . . nN

as long as we can specify the levels and kinematic invariants arbitrarily. From the discussion
of section 3.3 we see that this is possible for N ≤ 26 and hence N -particle scattering for
arbitrary levels can be expressed in terms of tachyon scattering.
    We can complete the argument for uniqueness by using the results of section 5, where
we showed that the bracket relations determine the N -tachyon amplitude up to a constant
cN (see (5.20)).

6.3. Summary

    We have established:
Theorem 1: A multilinear function AN : H⊗N → C, N ≤ 26, which satisfies
1. Poincaré invariance
2. The bracket relations (3.7).
3. The analyticity properties AP1 and AP2
is uniquely determined up to an overall constant, cN .
    Moreover, an easy argument gives:
Theorem 2: A set of multilinear functions {AN }N≤26 which satisfy 1,2,3 above as well
as AP3 are uniquely specified up to one parameter κ by cN = κN−2 .
    Theorem 2 follows in the standard way by examining the residue of a tachyon ampli-
tude at a tachyon pole. By AP3 this must be a product of tachyon amplitudes. Hence
cN1 +1 cN2 +1 = cN1 +N2 so cN = κN−2 , where κ is the string coupling.

Remark: We offer one speculation on how the above results can be generalized to N > 26.
In establishing theorem 1 we only used the bracket relations for currents J at levels 0, 1.
In order to extend the results to N > 26 it will be necessary to use higher level currents.
In the notation of section 3.3 , by fixing the ni , ñi we are only free to choose momenta
to fix independent invariants sij (i 6= j), on a codimension N subvariety I(ni , ñi ) of the
variety I(ni ) of all invariants sij at fixed ni . Nonetheless, it is possible that the amplitude

                                               23
can still be uniquely determined by generalizing the idea of “analytic continuation from
the integers” used previously. By varying the ñi at fixed ni one can possibly determine
the amplitude An1 ,...nN on “enough” subvarieties I(ni , ñi ) ⊂ I(ni ) that, when combined
with the axioms AP1,AP2, the amplitude is fixed on the entire variety I(ni ).



7. Closed Strings

      The closed string cohomology for ghost number (1, 1) is
                                                  Z
                        Hc = Hc1,1 = ⊕n∈ZZ+                  dp H[p, n] ⊗ H̄[p, n]                    (7.1)
                                                    IR25,1

where the superscript refers to left and right ghost number and the bar always stands
for “right-mover,” and not “complex conjugate.” S-matrix amplitudes are multilinear
functions Ac : Hc⊗n → C constructed as follows. The operator formalism associates a
measure Ω(V1 ⊗ V̄1 , . . . , Vn ⊗ V̄n ) on the moduli space of the n-punctured Riemann sphere,
M0,n . We integrate Ω over M0,n for an appropriate domain of sij and continue analytically
from there. There are two ways we may try to extend the above results to closed strings.

7.1. Factorization of Amplitudes

      A beautiful result of Kawai, Lewellen, and Tye [23] states that the closed and open
four-particle amplitudes are related by 9

              Ac (V1 ⊗ V¯1 , V2 ⊗ V¯2 ,V3 ⊗ V¯3 , V4 ⊗ V¯4 )
                                                                                                      (7.2)
                                        = − sin(πt)A(V1 , V2 , V3 , V4 )A(V¯1 , V¯3 , V¯2 , V¯4 )

At high energy we have

                Ac (V1 ⊗ V¯1 , V2 ⊗ V¯2 ,V3 ⊗ V¯3 , V4 ⊗ V¯4 )
                                                                                                      (7.3)

Similar, but more complicated remarks hold for n-particle scattering. We may combine
(7.2) with previous results to relate scattering of massive closed string states to closed
string tachyonic scattering.

      We take α′ = 2 for closed string amplitudes.

7.2. Algebraic structures for closed strings

    It is possible to extend the definition of the bracket to the closed string, as shown in
[16][17]. Composing this bracket with b+
                                       0 = b0 + b̄0 we obtain a map of the physical states
to themselves: Hc1,1 ⊗ Hc1,1 → Hc1,1 . This map is essentially a tensor product of open
string brackets and does not turn the physical states into a Lie algebra. Also, one cannot
justify the analog of (3.7). Thus, the most straightforward generalization of the previous
discussion does not work.
    Instead what one can do is consider Hc to be the “diagonal” subspace of the larger
space
                                               H̃c = Hopen ⊗ H̄open

defined by equality of left and right momenta: p = p̄. Amplitudes on the larger space H̃c
are only defined for n-tuples which are pairwise mutually local. The physical amplitudes
are a subset of this expanded set. It is straightforward to write bracket relations for this
expanded set of amplitudes. Suppose J ⊗ J¯ has momentum (q, q̄), and suppose further
         P                        P
that q + pi = 0, q · pi ∈ ZZ, q̄ + p̄i = 0, q̄ · p̄i ∈ ZZ. Then
               X
                       (−1)q·p2 +···q·pi (−1)q̄·p̄2 +···q̄·p̄ī
                i,ī                                                                               (7.4)
                                                                  ¯ V̄ī }, . . . , Vn ⊗ V̄n = 0
                                                                                         
              Ac V1 ⊗ V̄1 , . . . , {J, Vi} ⊗ V̄i , . . . ,Vī ⊗ {J,

Evidently, the previous sections apply to the left- and right- degrees of freedom separately
and fully determine the expanded set of amplitudes, hence a fortiori, the physical ones, at
least for n ≤ 26.
    One implication of these remarks is that the α′ → 0 limit of scattering amplitudes of
gravitons are in principle completely determined by the bracket relations. This raises the
interesting issue of the relation of bracket algebras and algebras of vector fields.


8. Conclusions

8.1. What we did

    We have shown that the bracket operation on mutually local BRST classes may be
combined with Lorentz invariance and analyticity to write an infinite set of functional
relations on string scattering amplitudes. These relations are rather restrictive. The
central results of this paper are theorems 1 and 2 of section 6.3 which state that the bracket

                                                           25
relations together with the analyticity axioms AP1,AP2, AP3 of section 2.3 uniquely
determine the genus zero open string S-matrix in terms of a single free parameter, κ, the
string coupling constant, at least for N ≤ 26-particle scattering.
    Some readers will be puzzled by our emphasis on high-energy limits. This limit might
seem irrelevant if the bracket relations already determine the amplitude for all energies.
The finite-difference relations are not, properly speaking, Ward identities since they relate
amplitudes at different energies. Our chief concern has been understanding the symmetries
of string theory and how they are realized in different backgrounds. Since high energy
limits of the finite-difference relations look more like Ward-identities they deserve special
attention.
    Some readers will object that this paper contains nothing new. After all, the structure
constants of the bracket are just the on-shell three point functions. By factorization, a
knowledge of all the three-point functions in principle determines the full S-matrix. If one
were mainly interested in explicit formulae for amplitudes the factorization approach would
be impracticable, whereas our approach could be made quite efficient. The important point
is, however, that the present discussion clarifies the fundamental role of the underlying
algebraic structure of the bracket.

8.2. What we should do

    There is plenty of room for further work.
    Clearly the restriction on N ≤ 26 for N -particle scattering is extremely unsatisfactory.
It is possible that the result of this paper can be extended to N > 26 by combining the
procedure of “analytic continuation from the integers” with bracket relations for states
other than lightlike states. Indeed, in arriving at our result we have used only a small
subset of the entire set of bracket relations.
    There are several possible generalizations of the present study. These include:
    1. String perturbation theory. Unfortunately, it is far from clear how to extend the
above results to quantum perturbation theory. The problem is that a chiral BRST class J
is not mutually local with respect to all states. That means {J, · } does not commute with
                                         P
an insertion of the identity operator       |IihI| or, more geometrically, contour integrals
of J cannot be pulled around handles. This problem disappears for total closed string
compactification, but, curiously, such theories have other difficulties with loop amplitudes
[6]. For the same reason extension to mixed open-closed string scattering is not trivial.

                                                 26
    Our attitude towards this problem is that in this paper we have managed to understand
better the classical symmetries of string theory. It remains to be seen how the symmetries
are realized quantum-mechanically. We are pursuing some ideas in this direction.
    2. Fermionic strings. It should be interesting to generalize these results to superstring
amplitudes. We intend to return to this in a future work.
    3.   Other backgrounds.     We have restricted attention to the background of 26-
dimensional Minkowski space. Bracket relations should exist for amplitudes in any back-
ground with an uncompactified Minkowski space component. If the monodromy of the
internal parts of vertex operators is abelian one should be able to adjust spacetime mo-
menta to obtain mutual locality in some situations. In such situations the technical lemma
of section 3.3 shows that one could write bracket relations for N ≤ d -particle scattering
where d is the number of uncompactified dimensions. The symmetry algebra of mutu-
ally local BRST classes will depend on the background. It is not clear how effective the
relations will be in other backgrounds.
    The bracket relations are very reminiscent of the “W∞ Ward identities” which have
been used to obtain amplitudes for string scattering in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime [13]
[24–26]. These techniques made essential use of the existence of a nontrivial ghost number
zero cohomology, something which is absent in the critical bosonic string. We hope that
the bracket relations will play a role in general backgrounds analogous to the “W∞ Ward
identities” of 1 + 1 dimensional string theory.
    Finally, finite difference relations for correlation functions are known to arise in certain
exactly solvable quantum field theories as well as in studies of q-deformed affine algebras.
It would be very interesting to discover an underlying quantum group symmetry in the
critical bosonic string S-matrix.

8.3. What are we doing?

    Beyond these questions of generalization there is the much larger question of exactly
what role the bracket should play in the formulation of string theory.
    We believe that the bracket relations are a stringy expression of spontaneous symmetry
breaking. On physical grounds one expects that symmetries which connect scattering of
states at different mass levels must be spontaneously broken. We will say that a current
J(z) (or, more generally, a ghost number 1 BRST class) is “broken” if it is not mutually
local with respect to some on-shell state. In the open string the on-shell condition is simply
Qψ = 0 so the only unbroken currents are ∂X µ . In the closed string statespace - viewed

                                              27
as a subspace of Hopen ⊗ H̄open - the on-shell condition requires furthermore that pL = pR .
According to this terminology all holomorphic BRST classes are off-shell and broken with
the exception of c∂X µ and its conjugate. Nevertheless, through the bracket relations these
holomorphic classes constrain the couplings of on-shell particles.
    From the above point of view, the uncompactified string contains infinitely many
broken symmetry algebras. These are the sets L = {Vi } of mutually local BRST invariant
states in Hopen which are closed under the bracket. We have seen in section 3.1 that such
sets L can be given the structure of a vectorially-graded Lie algebra. We can further justify
the name “broken symmetry algebra” for such sets L by noting that L can also be given
a Lie algebra structure, and that this Lie algebra is an algebra of unbroken symmetries
of some closed string toroidal compactification. The reason for this is that, if {pi } is the
set of momenta associated to {Vi } then Γ = hpi i is an even integral lattice. (Γ may be
Euclidean or Lorentzian.) The lattice is even since p2i = 2 − 2ni and integral by mutual
locality. By the Frenkel-Kac construction [27] [28], we can introduce cocycle operators to
turn the vectorially-graded bracket algebra of the {Vi } into a true Lie algebra structure on

                                LΓ = ⊕n≥0,p∈Γ H[p, n]        .

To see that this is the unbroken symmetry of a toroidal compactification recall that

                   (Γ; 0) ⊕ (0; Γ) ֒→{(pL ; pR )|pL , pR ∈ Γ∗ , pL − pR ∈ Γ}
                                     ∼
                                     = II D,D

and the unbroken symmetry associated with this background is LΓ ⊕ LΓ .
    It is further natural to consider maximal sets of mutually local BRST classes {Vi }. The
associated lattices have rank 26 and are necessarily hyperbolic. The associated Lie algebras
are unbroken symmetries of totally compactified backgrounds. Among these backgrounds
there is a distinguished compactification, namely, compactification on the torus defined
by Γ∗ = II 25,1 in the open case or on the Narain compactification for Γ∗ = (II 25,1 ; 0) ⊕
(0; II 25,1) in the closed case. Here II 25,1 is the unique even self-dual lattice in IR25,1 .
The corresponding algebra L∗ = LΓ∗ has been dubbed the “fake Monster Lie algebra” by
Borcherds [29] [30].
    Based on the analogy with Euclidean compactifications, which duly reproduces the
Higgs mechanism in the α′ → 0 limit [7], we may say that the uncompactified string is
a spontaneously broken gauge theory with the gauge algebra L∗ (in the open case) and
L∗ ⊕ L∗ (in the closed case) broken down to IR26 and IR26 ⊕ IR26 respectively.

                                              28
    At high energies the bracket relations become Ward identities. This should be un-
derstood as some kind of stringy high-energy symmetry restoration which replaces the
analogous notion in spontaneously broken gauge theory. (As shown in appendix B, the
standard field-theoretic approach does not generalize straightforwardly.) In this sense the
above hyperbolic Lie algebras of toroidal compactification “explain” the linear relations
on high energy amplitudes discussed in [1].

Remark: The uniqueness of S is a generalization of Proposition 14 of [6], with the fake
Monster Lie algebra replaced by the “vectorially-graded Lie algebroid of physical states.” It
is interesting to note that the structure constants of these two algebraic objects are closely
related. The structure constants of appendix A are, essentially, analytic continuations of
the structure constants of L∗ . One could say that the bosonic string S-matrix is made out
of the structure constants of L∗ .

8.4. What we dream of doing

    It is clear from a study of unbroken symmetries in toroidal compactification that the
Lie algebras L∗ , L∗ ⊕ L∗ , while distinguished, are not the full story. As explained in [6]
L∗ ⊕ L∗ is not a universal symmetry for closed string toroidal compactification. We hope
that there is some kind of “universal” algebraic structure in string theory which will replace
compact Lie algebras in the complete formulation of string theory as a generalization of
gauge theory.
    In nonabelian gauge theories like the standard model the on-shell asymptotic states
form representations of the symmetry group. Since the representations do not just involve
the adjoint there is, in general, no algebraic structure on the space of on-shell states. String
theories are a very interesting class of theories in which the on-shell states themselves form
an algebra. String theory might some day be regarded as the theory of symmetry in
its purest form: a single symmetry principle fixes entirely the particle content and the
interactions.

Note added: The earlier version of this paper erroneously claimed that the lemma of
section 3.3 applied to N -particle scattering for all N , not just N ≤ 26, and hence that
bracket relations fixed all N -particle amplitudes. I thank E. Witten for pointing out this
error. I also thank H. Verlinde for insisting on the point when I didn’t listen.

Appendix B. High energy symmetries and spontaneous symmetry breaking

    In [6] we proposed that the infinite dimensional symmetries arising upon time-
compactification - of which L∗ ⊕ L∗ is a spectacular example - are the high-energy sym-
metries of [1]. The idea was that Ward identities derived in a symmetric compactification
could be “parallel transported” to the decompactified background. The decompactifica-
tion forces momenta to infinity, hence the connection with high energy scattering. This
proposal was based on a field theoretic intuition: in field theory the effects of spontaneous
symmetry breaking disappear at high energies. It turns out that this intuition is not very
good in string theory. Closed string scattering at high energy is sensitive to the breaking
of toroidal symmetries. In this appendix we demonstrate that surprising fact with a few
simple examples.

B.1. Recovery of Ward Identities in Field Theory

    We consider enhanced symmetries and symmetry breaking in the framework of toroidal
compactification. (We only consider compactification of spacelike dimensions here.) Sup-
pose we have an unbroken symmetry current Jq = eiq·Y at a Narain lattice Γ which has a
vector (q; 0) with q 2 = 2. Consider a theory at Γ′ = g(λ) · Γ where g(λ) is a one-parameter
family of O(d, d) rotations taking (q; 0) to (qL ; qR ) with qR 6= 0. The symmetry associated
with J is spontaneously broken in spacetime leading to massive gauge bosons with mass
m2V /m2pl = qR
             2
               (λ) and α′ ∼ 1/m2pl is related to the Planck mass.
    Consider the scattering amplitudes A(V1 , . . . Vn ) for (massless and massive) gauge
                                                        2
bosons. The field-theory limit is obtained by letting qR  , pi · pj → 0 and expanding in these
                                                    P n (n)
variables. The amplitudes have an expansion A =        ǫ A in powers of ǫ = 1/mpl , where
each A(n) is a rational function of its arguments.
                                                               P
    If we have a Ward identity in the unbroken phase                A(V1 , . . . δVi , . . . Vm ) = 0 then we
may ask what happens to the corresponding amplitudes in the broken phase. The precise
definition of “corresponding amplitudes” requires a transport operator T λ on the BRST

                                                  31
cohomology. We will simply rotate momenta by O(d, d) transformations: this will suffice
for our examples. 10 For each n we have
                                X
                          lim       A(n) (T λ V1 , . . . T λ δVi , . . . T λ Vm ) = 0           (B.1)

and since A(n) are rational functions of pi · pj and of the symmetry-breaking masses qR
                                                                                      2
                                                                                        (λ)
we conclude that the sum of the terms is proportional to the symmetry breaking masses.
Therefore, for dimensional reasons, at each order in the expansion in 1/mpl the sum of
the terms grows more slowly in energy than the individual terms. In particular, for the
leading terms ∼ mnpl where n is a nonnegative power, the sum of the terms vanishes. This
is the recovery of the Ward identity at high energy.
      Example. To be explicit, consider a circular compactification of a single dimension
Y . Let R = eλ . At λ = 0 we have an unbroken SU (2) × SU (2) gauge theory which is
broken to U (1) × U (1) for λ > 0. Introduce the notation:

                                     √i   ( j+j̄
                                             R +(j−j̄)R)Y
                                                                √i   ( j+j̄
                                                                        R −(j−j̄)R)Ȳ
                     e(j, j̄, R) ≡ e 2                      (z)e 2                      (z̄)    (B.2)

Focus on a single factor SU (2) → U (1). In the broken phase we have massive gauge
bosons, call them W ± (ǫ), with corresponding vertex operators:

                                                            ¯ ip·X
                                W ± (ǫ, p) = e(±1, 0, R)ǫ · ∂Xe                                 (B.3)

where X, p refer to uncompactified dimensions. (B.3) are on shell for p · ǫ = 0, p2 +
2 sinh2 λ = 0. There are also massless gauge bosons for the unbroken U (1) generators, call
them Z(ǫ) described by vertex operators:

                                    Z(ǫ, p) = cosh λ∂Y ǫ · ¯
                                                           ∂Xeip·X                              (B.4)

which are on-shell for p · ǫ = 0, p2 = 0. (The factor of cosh λ in (B.4) is motivated by the
transport in [6]. It can be dropped without changing our conclusions.)
      At the su(2) point λ = 0 we have the su(2) Ward identity:

              0 = A W + (ǫ1 ),Z(ǫ2 ), W − (ǫ3 ), Z(ǫ4 ) (s, u)
                                                      

                           +A W + (ǫ1 ), W − (ǫ2 ), Z(ǫ3 ), Z(ǫ4 ) (s, u)

                                    + A W + (ǫ1 ), W − (ǫ2 ), W − (ǫ3 ), W + (ǫ4 ) (s, u)
                                                                                 

     What happens at λ > 0? For simplicity assume that all polarizations ǫi are transverse
to the plane of scattering and that ǫ1 · ǫ3 ǫ2 · ǫ4 = ǫ1 · ǫ4 ǫ2 · ǫ3 = 0, ǫ1 · ǫ2 ǫ3 · ǫ4 = 1. In the
field theory limit we have
                                       2(u − m2 )

                                       mpl        s − m2

where s ≡ p1 · p2 , u ≡ p1 · p3 , m2 ≡ 2 sinh2 λ. The sum of the three amplitudes is
                              m2 m2 − u    1 m4 2m2 − s − 2u
                          2             +                    +···
                              s s − m2    m2pl s  s − m2
     The high-energy field-theoretic limit is now obtained by letting s → −∞, u → ∞
holding m2 fixed. As promised, at each order in 1/mpl the sum vanishes more rapidly
than each of the separate amplitudes, and, in particular, the leading term of order O(m0pl )
vanishes.

B.2. String theory Ward identities are not recovered at high energy
     We illustrate this with two simple examples.
     Example 1:
     We now take the high energy limit of the three amplitudes in (B.5). The high energy
asymptotics of the amplitudes are:

                                                                          2

                     s 3 u2
                                                                          2
        A W + (ǫ1 ), W − (ǫ2 ), Z(ǫ3 ), Z(ǫ4 ) ∼ −U 2 (1 + sinh2 λ)e4 sinh λlog(u/s+1)

where U is defined in (3.10).
     While the sum of the three terms in (B.7) vanishes at λ = 0 this is not the case for
any λ 6= 0: the sum is not any smaller in magnitude than any of the three terms in the
sum.
     Example 2:
     At the SU (2) point the vertex operators φ±± = e(± 12 , ± 21 , R = 1)eip·X describe a
scalar field multiplet in the (2, 2) of SU (2) × SU (2). At the SU (2) point we have the Ward
identity (again for J + ):

 A(φ+− , φ−+ , φ+− , φ−+ ) + A(φ−− , φ++ , φ+− , φ−+ ) + A(φ−− , φ−+ , φ+− , φ++ ) = 0 (B.8)

In the broken phase λ > 0 and in the high energy limit the sum of the three terms becomes:
                                                                                
            1               R2        1                    2 1 R2      2 1 1/R2
               R 2 |z0 − 1|    +       1/R 2 − 1 U
                                                   2
                                                     = (sin 2 θ) + (cos 2 θ)    − 1 U2   (B.9)
         |z0 |                   |z0 |

Again we see that the sum of terms is no smaller than the individual terms.

B.3. Physical interpretation

     We believe that the failure to recover the Ward identities in the high energy limit is
related to the notorious delocalization of strings at ultrahigh energies [31]. This delocaliza-
tion makes the string amplitudes once again sensitive to relatively long-distance physics,
like the specific nature of the compactification scheme.
