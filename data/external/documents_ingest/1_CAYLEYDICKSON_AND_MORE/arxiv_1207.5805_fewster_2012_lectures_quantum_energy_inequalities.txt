ABSTRACT

We report our multiwavelength study of the 2011 outburst evolution of the newly discovered black hole candidate X-ray binary Swift J1357.2–0933. We analysed the Swift X-ray
telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT) data taken during the ∼7 months duration
of the outburst. It displayed a 2-10 keV X-ray peak luminosity of ∼ 1035 (D/1.5 kpc)2 erg s−1
which classifies the source as a very faint X-ray transient. We found that the X-ray spectrum at
the peak was consistent with the source being in the hard state, but it softened with decreasing
luminosity, a common behaviour of black holes returning to quiescence from the hard state.
The correlations between the simultaneous X-ray and ultraviolet/optical data suggest a system with a black hole accreting from a viscous disc, and we do not detect X-ray reprocessing
on the disc surface. The UVOT filters provide the opportunity to study these correlations up
to ultraviolet wavelengths, a regime so far unexplored. If the black hole nature is confirmed,
Swift J1357.2–0933 would be one of the very few established black hole very-faint X-ray
transients.

1 INTRODUCTION
X-ray binaries are the brightest X-ray point sources in our Galaxy.
They are black holes (BH) or neutron stars (NS) accreting material
from a companion star. The transient X-ray binaries alternate long
epochs of quiescence during which they have X-ray luminosities
of LX ∼ 1030−33 erg s−1 with outburst episodes during which
the luminosity increases more than two orders of magnitude. The
systems that reach a peak X-ray luminosity in their outbursts of
only Lpeak
∼ 1034−36 erg s−1 are called very-faint X-ray binary
X
transients (VFXTs). They are several orders of magnitude fainter at
their peaks than the better studied faint (Lpeak
∼ 1036−37 erg s−1 )
X

systems
(Wijnands et al.

2006).
It is in the last decade that VFXTs have been investigated in
detail thanks to the improvement in sensitivity and resolution
of the X-ray instruments in orbit. However, even though the
number of known sources has increased, their characteristics
are still not well known. A considerable fraction of them have
exhibited thermonuclear Type-I X-ray bursts, identifying the
accretor as a NS (eg. Cornelisse et al. 2002; Del Santo et al. 2007;
Chelovekov & Grebenev 2007; Degenaar & Wijnands 2009).

Swift J1357.2–0933 is a new VFXT BH candidate
(Casares et al. 2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private
communication) discovered with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope
(BAT; Barthelmy et al. 2005) on 2011 January 28 (Krimm et al.
2011). In the following days it was observed with several Xray satellites as well as ground-based telescopes. The MPI/ESO
2.2m telescope at La Silla detected a new optical source within
the Swift/BAT error circle. The magnitude difference compared to
archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images (when the source
was in quiescence) was ∼6 mag. This indicates a Galactic origin,
likely a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) or a dwarf nova outburst
(Rau et al. 2011), although the X-ray spectrum pointed to a LMXB
nature (Krimm et al. 2011). The SDSS photometry indicated that
the quiescent counterpart was very red and that the companion
was likely an M4 star. This resulted in a distance estimate of ∼1.5
kpc (Rau et al. 2011). In this work we present analysis of the Swift
X-ray and ultraviolet–optical (UV/optical) data of Swift J1357.2–
0933 along its 2011 outburst.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS
Immediately following its discovery Swift J1357.2–0933 was monitored with the Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004) throughout its
outburst both with the X-ray telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005)
and the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005),

which lasted ∼7 months. A total of 42 pointings were performed
during this period, for a total exposure time of 54.8 ks. A log of the
observations is given in Table 1. The observations were performed
daily in the first 10 days, and once every 2 days in the following
month. After that, the observations were separated by 1 to 2 weeks.

95 per cent confidence upper limits on the flux with WebPIMMS
HEASARC tool3 . An absorbed power-law model with a hydrogen
column density (NH ) of 1.2×1020 cm−2 (see Section 3) was
assumed. We used a photon index of Γ=2.13 which corresponds to
the value we obtained in the last observation where the source was
detected.

2.1 XRT data

In order to improve the statistics we have also combined observations that were performed within a few days time span and
that yielded comparable fluxes. As such, we have combined observations 03–05, 07–12, 13–15, 17–20, 21–25, 26–20, 30–33, 34–37,
38–41 and 43–44. We extracted the combined spectra, lightcurves
and images in the same way as the individual cases. We merged
the individual exposure maps created for each image using the task
ximage.

The Swift/XRT observations were obtained both in photoncounting (PC) and windowed timing (WT) modes. Due to the
high flux of Swift J1357.2–0933 the XRT was operated in WT
mode in the early observations in order to avoid pile-up (except for
the first observation; see below). When the count rate was below
0.5 count/s the observations were taken in PC mode (see Table 1).
The data were processed using the HEASoft v.6.11 software. The
raw data were reduced running the xrtpipeline task in which
standard event grades of 0–12 were selected for the PC data and
0–2 for the WT mode observations.
For every observation, spectra, lightcurves and images were
obtained using Xselect. The regions to extract the source events
both for PC and WT modes were centred at the source position
(RA=13h 57m 16.s 86, Dec=-09◦ 32′ 38.′′ 9, J2000, 0.′′ 42 error radius;
Krimm et al. 2011). For the WT data, we used a circle of ∼27 pixels of radius for the source and for the background extraction we
used an annulus centred on the source with ∼64 pixels for the inner
radius and ∼118 pixels for the outer radius. In the case of the PC
mode observations, the region used was a circle of ∼10 pixels of
radius for the source and for the background three circular regions
with the same size located in nearby source-free regions.
To look for eclipses, dips or X-ray bursts we checked the
lightcurves with different bin–sizes extracted for each observation.
We did not detect any evidence or feature that suggest modulations
or a pattern in the source flux, although we cannot rule out with
high confidence the presence of any modulations due to the low
count rate. We created the exposure maps in order to correct for
the effect of bad columns on the CCD, which in turn are used to
create the ancillary response files using the xrtmkarf task. The
latest versions of the response matrix files (v.14) were taken from
the HEASARC calibration database. Finally, with grppha we
grouped the spectra to have a minimum of 20 photons per bin to be
able to consistently use the χ2 . Due to the low number of counts
collected during observations 38/39/40/411 , we fitted these data
using both C-statistic and χ2 but grouped them with a minimum of
5 photons per bin. The results using both methods were consistent
with each other.
The first observation 01 was taken in PC mode which is
severely affected by pile-up. It has a count rate of 2.3 c/s, while the
pile-up becomes considerable in PC mode for count rates above
∼0.6 c/s (Evans et al. 2009; see also the Swift/XRT analysis web2 ).
Therefore we do not include this observation in our analysis. In
the last two XRT observations (43/44) the source was not detected.
The count rates were calculated using the prescription for small
numbers of counts given by Gehrels (1986). We calculated the

observation-ID’s in the main text. The full observation–ID’s are in Table

2.2 UVOT data
The UVOT observations were performed in image mode. Most of
them were taken with 6 filters (v, b, u, uvw1, uvm2, uvw2) but
some of them with only a few filters and sometimes only one.
We calculated the source’s magnitude (in the Vega system) and
flux densities with the uvotsource tool, which performs aperture photometry on the sky images. We selected a circular region
with a radius of 5 arcsec centred on the source and a circular region source–free with a radius of 18 arcsec for the background
correction. We corrected the magnitudes and fluxes for the Galactic extinction. The reddening is E(B–V)=0.04 mag in the direction
of Swift J1357.2–0933 (Schlegel et al. 1998). Using this value and
the prescription of Pei (1992) we calculate the extinction for every band. The obtained values are Av =0.123, Ab =0.163, Au =0.193,
Auvw1 =0.263, Auvm2 =0.387 and Auvw2 =0.349. The source is located at high Galactic latitude (b=50.0042) and for a distance of
1.5 kpc or larger, the source will be located outside the plane of
the Galaxy. Therefore, the measured column density (or reddening) corresponds to the full Galactic one in that direction. In case
of no source detection the uvotsource tool returns a 3–sigma
upper limit for the magnitudes.

3 RESULTS
3.1 X-ray light curve and spectra
We fitted the spectra using XSPEC (v 12.7.0). All observations
were well fitted with a simple power–law (powerlaw) affected
by photoelectric absorption (phabs). We assumed a column
density to Swift J1357.2–0933 of 1.2 ×1020 cm−2 constant with
time. We inferred this value from the high-resolution X-ray spectra
obtained with XMM-Newton (Armas Padilla et al. 2012 in prep),
which is consistent with that reported by Krimm et al. (2011). The
results are reported in Table 1, where the flux errors have been
calculated following the procedure presented by Wijnands et al.
(2004). We also tried other single component models like a blackbody (bbodyrad) and an accretion disk consisting of multiple
blackbody components (diskbb, Makishima et al. 1986) but both
models could not fit the data accurately (χ2ν > 3 and χ2ν > 1.5,
respectively). A two component model (diskbb+powerlaw)
can fit the data as well, however it does not improve the best fit of
the single power–law model and the additional thermal component

Note.- NH has been fixed to 1.2 ×1020 cm−2 , value inferred from the high-resolution X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton (Armas Padilla et al. 2012
in prep), which is consistent with that reported by Krimm et al. (2011).

contributes only a few per cent of the total flux.

the last two observations are between 2 and 6 × 1031 erg s−1 .

In Fig. 1 we show the 0.5–10 keV light curve. The outburst has its maximum as observed during observation 02
in the beginning4 , where the peak of the unabsorbed flux is
4.1 × 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1 . This corresponds to a peak luminosity
of 1.1 × 1035 erg s−1 assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc (Rau et al.
2011). After this, the luminosity monotonically decreases until
the source goes undetected using the XRT ∼180 days after the
discovery date. The upper–limits on the luminosity calculated from

Plotting the photon index evolution with time (Fig. 1) shows
that the photon index increases from a value of Γ ∼1.5 to a
value of Γ ∼2 indicating that the spectra became softer during
the decay of the outburst. This softening behaviour is also seen
when using the hardness ratio (HR; Fig.1 left panel). The hardness
ratio is defined as the ratio between the counts in the hard band
(2–10 keV) and the counts in the soft band (0.5–2 keV). We have
performed the same analysis when combining sets of observations
(see Section 2.1). The result is shown in Fig. 1 right panel. Due to
the smaller error bars, the increase of the photon index and the HR
decay are more clearly visible.

Observation 01 could be brighter, but due to the strong pile-up it was not
included in the analysis.

and the bottom panel is the hardness ratio evolution with time (ratio of the counts in the hard, 2-10 keV, and soft, 0.5-2 keV energy bands). All data are plotted
in the left figure, whereas in the right figure we present the result of the combined sets of observations (see Section 2.1).

3.2 Ultraviolet/optical and X-ray correlation
The Swift/UVOT observations were taken simultaneously with the
X-ray ones. Most of the observations were taken with all six filters,
which allows us to study the correlation between the X-ray and
the UV/optical emission along the outburst. Fig. 2 shows the Xray light curve and the UV/optical magnitudes in the Vega system.
The last UVOT detection (u band) was 203 days after the first detection when the source was already undetected in X-ray. Over the
course of the outburst the brightness in all bands is decreasing simultaneously with the decline in the X-rays. This resulted in a clear
correlation between X-ray and UV/optical fluxes which is shown in
Fig. 3. We have assumed a power-law model to fit these correlations
and calculate the correlation slopes β (FU V /optical ∝ FX β ). We
have calculated β for every UVOT band and for the X-ray flux in
the 2–10 keV energy range in order to compare them with values in
previous publications (e.g. Russell et al. 2006). However, the spectral resolution of Swift/XRT allows us to also measure the correlation slopes for X-ray fluxes in the 0.5–10 keV energy range. The
results are shown in Table 2. Clearly β increases towards shorter
wavelengths, going from 0.2 in the v band to 0.37 uvw2 (using the
0.5–10 keV energy range). The numbers become 0.19 to 0.35 in the

We have analysed the XRT and UVOT data taken over the
∼7 months duration of the 2011 outburst of the newly discovered
candidate black hole LMXB Swift J1357.2–0933. We fitted the

Swift/XRT spectra using a simple power-law model affected by
absorption. The peak flux was reached at the beginning of the
outburst, after which, it steadily decreased until the source went undetected with XRT ∼180 days after its discovery. The unabsorbed
peak flux has a value of FX,unabs = 4.1× 10−10 erg cm−2 s−1 in
the 0.5–10 keV energy range, which corresponds to an outburst
peak luminosity of LX =1.1× 1035 erg s−1 assuming a distance of
1.5 kpc. This low peak luminosity classifies Swift J1357.2–0933
as a VFXT, which have peak luminosities Lpeak
<1036 erg s−1 .

Even if the source was located at a distance of 8 kpc the inferred
peak luminosity is a few times 1036 erg s−1 , still in the faint
regime. However, such long distance is unlikely since the high
Galactic latitude (b=50.0042) would place Swift J1357.2–0933 at
6 kpc above the Galactic plane.

considerably softer, with a photon index regime from Γ=2.0 to
Γ=2.7. The reason for Swift J1357.2–0933 to have harder spectra
than XTE J1719–291 could be a difference in the nature of their
compact objects. Although it is not established, the characteristics
of XTE J1719–291 favour a NS accretor (Armas Padilla et al.
2011) whereas Swift J1357.2–0933 has been identify as a strong
BH candidate system using optical spectroscopy (Casares et al.
2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private communication).

The system was in the hard state at peak of the outburst and
remained in this state throughout the outburst, which is usual at
these low X-ray luminosities (see Belloni 2010 for the state definitions). From the first observation until the last one the spectral
index of the power law increases from 1.5 to 2.1. As can be seen in
Fig. 1, the X-ray luminosity and photon index are anti-correlated.
The softening can also be seen in the HR curve demonstrating that
it does not depend on assumed spectral model. It shows how the
spectrum becomes softer as the luminosity decays (Fig. 1). Such
softening behaviour was also present in the VFXT XTE J1719–291
(Armas Padilla et al. 2011), but for this source the spectra were

The upper-limit on the luminosity inferred from the nondetections in the last two observations is LX ∼ 2×1031 erg s−1 .
This could indicate that the nature of the accretor is a BH
since they typically have quiescent luminosities in the range of
LX ∼ 1030 − 1031 erg s−1 while the NS’s usually have quiescent
luminosities LX >1032 erg s−1 (but see Jonker et al. 2007 for an
exception).
Several other BH sources have shown softening in their X-ray
spectra at low luminosities. XTE J1650–500 softened in its 20012002 outburst. The photon index changed from Γ=1.66 to Γ=1.93
when the luminosity decayed to 2×1034 erg s−1 (Tomsick et al.
2004). Also at these intermediate luminosities 4U 1543–47 evolved
from a photon index of Γ=1.64 in its hard state to a photon index
of Γ=2.22 at lower LX (Kalemci et al. 2005). By studying a sample of 7 BHs in their quiescence state, Corbel et al. (2006) arrived
to the conclusion that all BHs are softer in quiescence than in the
standard hard state. Using a study of 25 BHs, Dunn et al. (2010)
presented data from which the same conclusion can be inferred:
when data are available, the sources show softening towards quiescence. However, in the 2008 outburst decay of H 1743–322 to quiescence, Jonker et al. (2010) did not see any evidence of softening,
although it cannot be ruled out that this is caused the inaccuracy in
the photon index due to the high NH .

4.1 X-ray and UV/optical simultaneous data: A
non-irradiated accretion disc
The proximity and the low Galactic extinction towards
Swift J1357.2–0933 have made it possible to obtain X-ray
and UV/optical data simultaneously using XRT and UVOT
instruments on board Swift. Until today this had not been possible
for any VFXT since, in addition to their low luminosity, the vast

majority are located towards the Galactic centre, which makes
it very difficult to detect the optical counterpart due to the high
Galactic absorption.
The optical/UV and X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated during
the outburst (Fig. 2). Russell et al. (2006) quantified the disc and
jet contribution from the optical/infrared and X-ray (2-10 keV)
correlation in the hard state. Based on the values of β expected
from the different emission processes (sections 3.3 and 3.4 of
their work), our correlation in the v band is consistent with a BH
accreting via a non irradiated viscous disc. For a viscously heated
disc, 0.15 ⩽ β ⩽ 0.25 is expected in the case of a BH (for V-band
optical and 2–10 keV X-ray), and for Swift J1357.2–0933 we find
β = 0.2 (Table 2). For a NS, 0.3 ⩽ β ⩽ 0.5 is predicted, so our
correlation is consistent with optical emission from a viscously
heated disc around a BH accretor. Higher values of β are expected
if the optical emission originates in an irradiated accretion disc or
a jet.
Additionally, Frank et al. (2002) predict a dependency of the slopes
β with the wavelength. For optical emission from a viscously
heated steady-state disc, β increases at shorter wavelengths. This
is consistent with our results, where β increases from 0.2 in the
v band to 0.35 in the uvw2 one (see Table 2). Therefore, all the
evidence favours UV/optical emission dominated by the viscously
heated disc, with little or no X-ray irradiation detected.
