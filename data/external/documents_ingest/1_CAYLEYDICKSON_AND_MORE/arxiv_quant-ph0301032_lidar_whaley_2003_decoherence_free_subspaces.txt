                                      Abstract. Decoherence is the phenomenon of non-unitary dynamics that arises as
                                      a consequence of coupling between a system and its environment. It has important
                                      harmful implications for quantum information processing, and various solutions to the
                                      problem have been proposed. Here we provide a detailed a review of the theory of
                                      decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems, focusing on their usefulness for preserva-
                                      tion of quantum information.


                                      1   Introduction
                                      Recent results indicating that quantum information processing (QIP) is inher-
                                      ently more powerful than its classical counterpart [1–3] have motivated a resur-
                                      gence of interest in the problem of decoherence [4]. Decoherence is a consequence
                                      of the inevitable coupling of any quantum system to its environment (or bath),
                                      causing information loss from the system to this environment. It was recognized
                                      early on that decoherence poses a serious obstacle to physical realization of quan-
                                      tum information processors [5, 6]. Here we define decoherence as non-unitary
                                      dynamics that is a consequence of system-environment coupling. This includes
                                      (but is not limited to) both dissipative and dephasing contributions, tradition-
                                      ally known as T1 and T2 processes, respectively. Dissipation refers to processes in
                                      which the populations of the quantum states are modified by interactions with
                                      the environment, while dephasing refers to processes that randomize the relative
                                      phases of the quantum states. Both are caused by entanglement of the system
                                      with environmental degrees of freedom, leading to non-unitary system dynam-
                                      ics [7]. For QIP and other forms of quantum control, any such interaction that
                                      degrades the unitary nature of the quantum evolution is undesirable, since it
                                      causes loss of coherence of the quantum states and hence an inevitable decay of
                                      their interference and entanglement. Interference is crucial for coherent control
                                      schemes [8, 9], while entanglement is believed to be as important an ingredient
                                      of the quantum computational speed-up [10]. In fact, a sufficiently decohered
                                      quantum computer can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer [11]. In
                                      this review we provide a detailed introduction to the theory of decoherence-free
                                      subspaces and subsystems (DFSs), which have been conceived as one of the
                                      possible solutions to decoherence in QIP. Space limitations prevent us from dis-
                                      cussing in detail the interesting problem of performing computation using DFSs.
                                      Instead we focus here on the use of DFSs as a way to preserve delicate quantum
                                      information.

2   Historical Background
Environment-induced decoherence is a very extensively studied phenomenon in
the quantum theory of measurement, and of the transition from quantum to
classical behavior. Zurek has shown that environmental superselection results
in the establishment of certain special states that show redundancies in their
correlations with the environment, and that may consequently be essentially un-
perturbed by this [12]. These states, referred to as “pointer states” , are defined
by a “predictability sieve” [13]. While analysis of measurements are compli-
cated by the presence of a measurement apparatus in addition to the system
and environment, the notion of a special set of states that are defined by some
underlying symmetry in the global physical description is a common element.
Another noteworthy early study employing symmetries in order to reduce the
coupling of subsets of system states to the environment is Alicki’s work on lim-
ited thermalization [14]. Identifying the power of such symmetries in the physical
Hamiltonian, and systematizing the way to find such symmetries has been one
of the major innovative features of the recent development of DFS theory and
its applications for quantum computation.
    Early discussions of the effects of decoherence on quantum computation fo-
cused on putting conditions on the strength of coupling of the system-environment
coupling and on the duration of quantum gates [5, 6]. The search for systematic
ways to bypass decoherence in the context of QIP, based on identification of
states that might be immune to certain decohering interactions, started with
observations of Palma, Suominen, and Ekert [15] in a study of the effects of
pure dephasing, that two qubits possessing identical interactions with the en-
vironment do not decohere. Palma et al. used the term “subdecoherence” to
describe this phenomenon, suggested using the corresponding states to form a
“noiseless” encoding into logical qubits, and noted that the set of states ro-
bust against dephasing will depend on the specific form of qubit-environment
coupling. This model was subsequently studied using a different method by
Duan and Guo [16], with similar conclusions and a change of terminology to
“coherence preserving states”. The idea of pairing qubits as a means for pre-
serving coherence was further generalized by Duan and Guo in [17], where it
was shown that both collective dephasing and dissipation could be prevented.
However this assumed knowledge of the system-environment coupling strength.
These early studies were subsequently cast into a general mathematical frame-
work for DFSs of more general system/environment interactions by Zanardi and
Rasetti, first for the spin-boson model in [18], where the important “collective
decoherence” model was introduced (where several qubits couple identically to
the same environment, while undergoing both dephasing and dissipation), then
for general Hamiltonians [19]. Their elegant algebraic analysis established the
importance of identifying the dynamical symmetries in the system-environment
interaction, and provided the first general formal condition for decoherence-free
(DF) states, that did not require knowledge of the system-environment coupling
strength. In the work of Zanardi and Rasetti these are referred to as “error
avoiding codes”. Several papers focusing on collective dissipation appeared sub-
                                Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems          3

sequently [20–22], as well as applications to encoding information in quantum
dots [23, 24]. Zanardi [25] and independently Lidar, Chuang, and Whaley [26]
showed that DF states could also be derived from very general considerations
of Markovian master equations. Lidar et al. introduced the term “decoherence-
free subspace”, analyzed their robustness against perturbations, and pointed out
that the absence of decoherence for DF states can be spoiled by evolution under
the system Hamiltonian, identifying a second major requirement for viable use
of the DF states for either quantum memory or quantum computation [26]. A
completely general condition for the existence of DF states was subsequently
provided in terms of the Kraus operator sum representation (OSR) by Lidar,
Bacon and Whaley [27]. All these studies share essentially the same canonical
example of system-environment symmetry: A qubit-permutation symmetry in
the system-environment coupling, that gives rise to collective dephasing, dissi-
pation, or decoherence. The other main example of a symmetry giving rise to
large DFSs was provided by Lidar et al. in [28]. This is a much weaker form of
spatial symmetry than permutation-invariance, termed “multiple-qubit errors”,
which we describe in detail in Section 6.4.
    Several papers reported various generalizations of DFSs, e.g., by extending
DFSs to quantum groups [29], using the rigged Hilbert space formalism [30], and
deriving DFSs from a scattering S-matrix approach [31]. However, the next ma-
jor step forward in generalizing the DFS concept was taken by Knill, Laflamme,
and Viola [32], who introduced the notion of a “noiseless subsystem”. Whereas
previous DFS work had characterized DF states as singlets (one dimensional ir-
reducible representations) of the algebra generating the dynamical symmetry in
the system-bath interaction, the work by Knill et al. showed that higher dimen-
sional irreducible representations can support DF states as well. An important
consequence was the reduction of the number of qubits needed to construct a
DFS under collective decoherence from four to three. This was noted indepen-
dently by De Filippo [33] and by Yang and Gea-Banacloche [34]. The generaliza-
tion from subspaces to subsystems has provided a powerful and elegant tool on
which the full theory of universal, fault tolerant quantum computation on DF
states has now been established [35, 36]. It has also provided a basis for unify-
ing essentially all known decoherence-suppression/avoidance strategies [37, 38].
In the remainder of this chapter we shall follow our usual convention to refer
to both subsystems and subspaces interchangeably with the acronym DFS, the
distinction being made explicit when necessary.
     Following the initial studies establishing the conditions for DFSs, Bacon,Lidar,
and Whaley made a thorough investigation of the robustness of DF states to
symmetry breaking perturbations [39]. These authors also showed that the pas-
sive error correction (“error avoidance”) properties of a DFS can be combined
with the active error correction protocols provided by quantum error correc-
tion by concatenation of a DFS inside a quantum error correcting code (QECC)
[2, 40], resulting in an encoding capable of protecting against both collective and
independent errors [27]. A combined DFS-QECC method was shown to be neces-
sary in order to be enable universal, fault tolerant quantum computation in the
4      Lidar & Whaley

multiple-qubit errors model [41]. Interestingly, the DFS for collective decoher-
ence offers a natural energy barrier against other decoherence processes, a phe-
nomenon termed “supercoherence” by Bacon, Brown and Whaley [42]. Several
more recent studies, by Alber et al. and Khodjasteh and Lidar, have considered
other hybrid DFS-QECC schemes, focusing in particular on protection against
spontaneous emission [43–45]. DFSs have also been combined with the quantum
Zeno effect by Beige et al. [46, 47]. Most recently, a combination of DFSs and the
method of dynamical decoupling [48] was shown to offer a complete alternative
to QECC [49, 50].
    These explicit theoretical demonstrations that, firstly, DF states exist and
can provide stable quantum memory, and second, that fault tolerant universal
computation can be performed on states encoded into a DFS, while initially su-
perficially surprising to many, have generated several experimental searches for
verification of DFSs. The first experimental verification came with a demonstra-
tion by Kwiat et al. of a 2-qubit DFS protecting photon states against collective
dephasing [51]. The same 2-qubit DFS was subsequently constructed and veri-
fied to reduce decoherence in ion trap experiments by Kielpinski et al. [52]. In
the latter experiment an atomic state of one ion was combined with that of a
spectator ion to form a 2-ion DF state that was shown to be protected against
dephasing deriving from long wavelength ambient magnetic field fluctuations.
This experiment is significant in showing the potential of DFS states to protect
fragile quantum state information against decoherence operative in current ex-
perimental schemes. More recently, universal control on the same 2-qubit DFS
for collective dephasing has been demonstrated in the context of liquid state nu-
clear magnetic resonance by Fortunato et al. [53]. Nuclear magnetic resonance
has also led to the first experimental demonstration, by Viola et al., of a 3-qubit
DF subsystem, providing immunity against full collective decoherence deriving
from a combination of collective spin flips and collective dephasing [54]. With
these first experimental demonstrations, further experimental efforts towards
implementation of DFSs in active quantum computation, or merely as quantum
memory encodings to transport single qubits from one position to another with-
out incurring dephasing, seems assured. For example, the use of a DFS has been
identified as a major component in the construction of a scalable trapped ion
quantum computer [50, 55, 56].
    A common criticism of the theory of DFSs has been that the conditions re-
quired for a DFS to exist are very stringent and the assumptions underlying the
theory may be too unrealistic. It is important to emphasize that the DFS concept
was never meant to provide a full and independent solution to all decoherence
problems. Instead, the central idea has been to make use of the dynamical sym-
metries in the system-environment interaction first (if they exist), and then to
consider the next level of protection against decoherence. The robustness prop-
erties of DFSs ensure that this is a reasonable approach. In addition, while the
experimental evidence to date [51–54, 57, 58], is a reason for cautious optimism,
there have also been a number of theoretical studies showing that the condi-
tions for DFSs may be created via the use of the dynamical decoupling method,
                                Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems          5

by symmetrizing the system-bath interaction [59–62]. This holds true for a wide
range of system-bath interaction Hamiltonians. It seems quite plausible that such
active “environment engineering” methods will be necessary for DFSs to become
truly comprehensive tools in the quest to protect fragile quantum information.
    In the remainder of this review we will now leave the historical perspective
and provide instead a summary of the theory of DF subspaces and their gener-
alizations, DF subsystems. We shall start, in Section 3 with a simple example
of DFSs in physical systems that is then used as a basis for a rigorous analysis
of decoherence and the conditions for lack of this in an open quantum system
(Section 4). We then provide, in Section 5, a series of complementary charac-
terizations of what a DFS is, using both exact and approximate formulations
of open systems dynamics. A number of examples of DFSs in different physical
systems follow in Section 6, some of them new. The later sections of the review
deal with the generalization to DF Subsystems (Section 7), and the robustness
of DFSs (Section 8). We conclude in Section 9.


3   A Simple Example of Decoherence-Free Subspaces:
    Collective Dephasing

Let us begin by analyzing in detail the operation of the simplest DFS. This
example, first analyzed by Palma et al. in [15] and generalized by Duan & Guo
[16], will serve to illustrate what is meant by a DFS. Suppose that a system
of K qubits (two-level systems) is coupled to a bath in a symmetric way, and
undergoes a dephasing process. Namely, qubit j undergoes the transformation

                          |0ij → |0ij      |1ij → eiφ |1ij ,                     (1)

which puts a random phase φ between the basis states |0i and |1i (eigenstates
of σz with respective eigenvalues +1 and −1). This can also be described by
the matrix Rz (φ) = diag 1, eiφ acting on the {|0i, |1i} basis. We assume that
the phase has no space (j) dependence, i.e., the dephasing process is invariant
under qubit permutations. This symmetry is an example of the more general
situation known as “collective decoherence” . Since the errors can be expressed
in terms of the single Pauli spin matrix σz of the two-level system, we refer
to this example as “weak collective decoherence” . The more general situation
when errors involving all three Pauli matrices are present, i.e., dissipation and
dephasing, is referred to as “strong collective decoherence” . Without encoding
a qubit initially in an arbitrary pure state |ψij = a|0ij + b|1ij will decohere.
This can be seen by calculating its density matrix as an average over all possible
values of φ,               Z  ∞
                      ρj =        Rz (φ)|ψij hψ|Rz† (φ) p(φ)dφ,
                             −∞

where p(φ) is a probability density, and we assume the initial state of all qubits to
                                                                −1/2
be a product state. For a Gaussian distribution, p(φ) = (4πα)        exp(−φ2 /4α),
6        Lidar & Whaley

it is simple to check that

                                            |a|2 ab∗ e−α
                                                          
                               ρj =                            .
                                           ∗ −α
                                          a be     |b|2

The decay of the off-diagonal elements in the computational basis is a signature
of decoherence.
    Let us now consider what happens in the two-qubit Hilbert space. The four
basis states undergo the transformation

                             |0i1 ⊗ |0i2 → |0i1 ⊗ |0i2
                             |0i1 ⊗ |1i2 → eiφ |0i1 ⊗ |1i2
                             |1i1 ⊗ |0i2 → eiφ |1i1 ⊗ |0i2
                             |1i1 ⊗ |1i2 → e2iφ |1i1 ⊗ |1i2 i.

Observe that the basis states |0i1 ⊗ |1i2 and |1i1 ⊗ |0i2 acquire the same phase.
This suggests that a simple encoding trick can solve the problem. Let us define
encoded states by |0L i = |0i1 ⊗ |1i2 ≡ |01i and |1L i = |10i. Then the state
|ψL i = a|0L i + b|1L i evolves under the dephasing process as

                 |ψL i → a|0i1 ⊗ eiφ |1i2 + beiφ |1i1 ⊗ |0i2 = eiφ |ψL i,

and the overall phase thus acquired is clearly unimportant. This means that
the 2-dimensional subspace DF S2 (0) = Span{|01i, |10i} of the 4-dimensional
Hilbert space of two qubits is decoherence-free. The subspaces DF S2 (2) = Span{|00i}
and DF S2 (−2) = Span{|11i} are also (trivially) DF, since they each acquire a
global phase as well, 1 and e2iφ respectively. Since the phases acquired by the
different subspaces differ, there is decoherence between the subspaces.1
    For K = 3 qubits a similar calculation reveals that the subspaces DF S3 (1) =
Span{|001i, |010i, |100i} and DF S3 (−1) = Span{|011i, |101i, |110i} are DF, as
well the (trivial) subspaces DF S3 (3) = Span{|000i} and DF S3 (3) = Span{|111i}.
    More generally, let

                    λK = number of 0′ s minus the number of 1′ s

in a computational basis state (i.e., a bitstring) over K qubits. Then it is easy to
check that any subspace spanned by states with constant λK is DF, and can be
denoted DF SK (λK ) in accordance with the notation above. The dimensions of
these
     subspaces are given by the binomial coefficients: d ≡ dim[DF SK (λK )] =
  K
 λK and they each encode log2 d qubits.
    The encoding for the “collective phase damping” model discussed here has
been tested experimentally. The first-ever experimental implementation of DFSs
used the DF S2 (0) subspace to protect against artifially induced decoherence in
1
    This conclusion is actually somewhat too strict: for a non-equilibrium environment,
    superpositions of different DFSs can be coherent in the collective dephasing model
    [63].
                                Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems     7

a linear optics setting [51]. The same encoding was subsequently used to allevi-
ate the problem of external fluctuating magnetic fields in an ion trap quantum
computing experiment [52], and figures prominently in theoretical constructions
of encoded, universal quantum computation [49, 50, 64].


4   Formal Treatment of Decoherence
Let us now present a more formal treatment of decoherence. Consider a closed
quantum system, composed of a system S of interest defined on a Hilbert space
H (e.g., a quantum computer) and a bath B. The full Hamiltonian is

                       H = HS ⊗ IB + IS ⊗ HB + HI ,                          (2)

where HS , HB and HI are, respectively, the system, bath and system-bath
interaction Hamiltonians, and I is the identity operator. The evolution of the
closed system is given by ρSB (t) = UρSB (0)U† , where ρSB is the combined
system-bath density matrix and the unitary evolution operator is

                                 U = exp(−iHt)                               (3)

(we set h̄ = 1). Assuming initial decoupling between system and bath, the evo-
lution of the closed system is given by: ρSB (t) = U(t)[ρS (0) ⊗ ρB (0)]U† (t).
Without loss of generality the interaction Hamiltonian can be written as
                                    X
                              HI =      Sα ⊗ Bα ,                          (4)
                                       α

where Sα and Bα are, respectively, system and bath operators. It is this cou-
pling between system and bath that causes decoherence in the system, through
entanglement with the bath. To see this more clearly it is useful to arrive at a
description of the system alone by averaging out the uncontrollable bath degrees
of freedom, a procedure formally implemented by performing a partial trace over
the bath:
                       ρ(t) = TrB [U(t)ρ(0) ⊗ ρB (0)U† (t)].
The reduced density matrix ρ(t) now describesP    the system alone. By diagonal-
izing the initial bath density matrix, ρB (0) = ν λν |νihν|, and evaluating the
partial trace in the same basis one finds:
                                                        !
                       X                   X
                ρ(t) =    hµ|U(t) ρ(0) ⊗       λν |νihν| U† (t)|µi
                       µ                    ν

                    Aa = λν hµ|U|νi ;           a = (µ, ν).                  (6)
8      Lidar & Whaley

The expression (5) is known as the Operator Sum Representation (OSR) and
can be derived from an axiomatic approach to quantum mechanics, without
reference to Hamiltonians [65]. Since Trρ(t) = 1 the Kraus operators satisfy the
normalization constraint        X
                                    A†a Aa = IS .                            (7)
                                     a

Because of this constraint it follows that when the sum in Eq. (5) includes only
one term the dynamics is unitary. Thus a simple criterion for decoherence in the
OSR is the presence of multiple independent terms in the sum in Eq. (5).
    While the OSR is a formally exact description of the dynamics of the system
density matrix, its utility is somewhat limited because the explicit calculation of
the Kraus operators is equivalent to a full diagonalization of the high-dimensional
Hamiltonian H. Furthermore, the OSR is in a sense too strict. This is because
as a closed-system formulation it incorporates the possibility that information
which is put into the bath will back-react on the system and cause a recurrence.
Such interactions will always occur in the closed-system formulation (due to the
the Hamiltonian being Hermitian). However, in many practical situations the
likelihood of such an event is extremely small. Thus, for example, an excited
atom which is in a “cold” bath will radiate a photon and decohere, but the
bath will not in turn return the atom back to its excited state, except via the
(extremely long) recurrence time of the emission process. In these situations a
more appropriate way to describe the evolution of the system is via a quantum
dynamical semigroup master equation [66, 67]. By assuming that (i) the evolu-
tion of the system density matrix is governed by a one-parameter semigroup
(Markovian dynamics), (ii) the evolution is futher “completely positive” [67],
and (iii) the system and bath density matrices are initially decoupled, Lindblad
[66] has shown that the most general evolution of the system density matrix
ρS (t) is governed by the master equation

              dρ(t)
                       = −i[H̃S , ρ(t)] + LD [ρ(t)]
               dt
                              M
                            1 X                                     
              LD [ρ(t)] =       aαβ [Fα , ρ(t)F†β ] + [Fα ρ(t), F†β ]          (8)
                            2
                             α,β=1


where H̃S = HS + ∆ is the system Hamiltonian HS including a possible unitary
contribution from the bath ∆ (“Lamb shift” ), the operators Fα constitute a ba-
sis for the M -dimensional space of all bounded operators acting on H, and aαβ
are the elements of a positive semi-definite Hermitian matrix. The commutator
involving H̃S is the ordinary, unitary, Heisenberg term. All the non-unitary, de-
cohering dynamics is accounted for by LD , and this is one of the advantages of
the Lindblad equation: unlike the OSR, it clearly separates unitary from deco-
hering dynamics. For a derivation of the Lindblad equation from the OSR, using
a coarse graining procedure, including an explicit calculation of the coefficients
aαβ and the Lamb shift ∆, see [68]. Note that the Fα can often be identified
with the Sα of the interaction Hamiltonian in Eq. (4) [68].

5     The DFS Conditions

With the above statement of the conditions for decoherence let us now show
how to formally eliminate decoherence. It is convenient to do so by reference
to the Hamiltonian, OSR, and semigroup formulations. This leads to a number
of essentially equivalent formulations of the conditions for DF dynamics, whose
utility is determined by the approach one would like to employ to study a specific
problem. In addition, it is useful to give formulations which make contact with
the theory of quantum error correcting codes (QECC). First, let us give a formal
definition of a DFS:

Definition 1. A system with Hilbert space H is said to have a decoherence-free
subspace H̃ if the evolution inside H̃ ⊂ H is purely unitary.

   Note that because of the possibility of a bath-induced Lamb shift [∆ in
Eq. (8)] this definition of a DFS does not entirely rule out adverse effects a
bath may have on a system. Also, we are not excluding unitary errors that
may be the result of inaccurate implementation of quantum logic gates. Both of
these problems, which in practice are inseparable, must be dealt with by other
methods, such as concatenated codes [27].


5.1   Hamiltonian Formulation

As remarked above, in terms of the Hamiltonian H of Eq. (2), decoherence is the
result of the entanglement between system and bath caused by the interaction
term HI . In other words, if HI = 0 then system and bath are decoupled and
evolve independently and unitarily under their respective Hamiltonians HS and
HB . Clearly, then, a sufficient condition for decoherence free (DF) dynamics
is that HI = 0. However, since one cannot simply switch off the system-bath
interaction, in order to satisfy this condition it is necessary to look for special
subspaces of the full system Hilbert space H. As shown first by Zanardi and
Rasetti [19], such a subspace is found by assuming that there exists a set {|k̃i}
of eigenvectors of the Sα ’s with the property that:

                            Sα |k̃i = cα |k̃i   ∀α, |k̃i.                        (9)
Note that these eigenvectors are degenerate, i.e., the eigenvalue cα depends only
on the index α of the system operators, but not on the state index k. If HS leaves
the Hilbert subspace H̃ = Span[{|k̃i}] invariant, and if we start within H̃, then
the evolution of the system will be DF. To show this we follow the derivation in
[27]: First expand the initial
                           P density matrices of theP  system and the bath in their
respective bases: ρS (0) = ij sij |ı̃ihj̃| and ρB (0) = µν bµν |µihν|. Using Eq. (9),
one can write the combined operation of the bath and interaction Hamiltonians
over H̃ as:
                                                           X
               IS ⊗ HB + HI = IS ⊗ Hc ≡ IS ⊗ [HB +            aα Bα ].
                                                            α
10      Lidar & Whaley

This clearly commutes with HS over H̃. Thus since neither HS (by our own
stipulation) nor the combined Hamiltonian Hc takes states out of the subspace:

                          U[|ı̃i ⊗ |µi] = US |ı̃i ⊗ Uc |µi,                    (10)
where US = exp(−iHS t) and Uc = exp(−iHc t). Hence it is clear, given the
initially decoupled state ofP  the density matrix, that
                                                    P the evolution of the closed
system will be: ρSB (t) = ij sij US |ı̃ihj̃|U†S ⊗ µν bµν Uc |µihν|U†c . It follows
using simple algebra that after tracing over the bath: ρS (t) = TrB [ρSB (t)] =
US ρS (0)U†S , i.e., that the system evolves in a completely unitary fashion on H̃:
under the condition of Eq. (9) the subspace is DF. As shown in Ref. [19] by
performing a short-time expansion, Eq. (10) is also a necessary condition for a
DFS. Let us summarize this:

Theorem 1. Let the interaction between a system and a bath be given by the
Hamiltonian of Eq. (2). If HS leaves the Hilbert subspace H̃ = Span[{|k̃i}] in-
variant, and if we start within H̃, then H̃ is a DFS if and only if it satisfies
Eq. (9).

    The condition of Eq. (9) is very useful for checking whether a given interaction
supports a DFS: The operators Sα often form a Lie algebra, and the condition
(9) then translates into the problem of finding the one-dimensional irreducible
representations (irreps) of this Lie algebra, a problem with a textbook solution
[69]. We will consider this in detail through examples below.


5.2   Operator-Sum Representation Formulation

Let H̃ be an N -dimensional DFS. As first observed in [27], in this case it fol-
lows immediately from Eqs. (10) and (6) that the Kraus operators all have the
following representation (in the basis where the first N states span H̃):

                                                       √
                                       
                              ga Ũ 0
                   Aa =                     ;   ga =       νhµ|Uc |νi.         (11)
                               0 Āa

Here Āa is an arbitrary matrix that acts on H̃⊥ (H = H̃ ⊕ H̃⊥ ) and may cause
decoherence there; Ũ is restricted to H̃. This simple condition can be summarized
as follows:

Theorem 2. A subspace H̃ is a DFS if and only if all Kraus operators have
an identical unitary representation upon restriction to it, up to a multiplicative
constant.

    An explicit calculation will help to illustrate this condition for a DFS. Con-
sider the set of system states {|k̃i} satisfying:

                              Aa |k̃i = ga Ũ|k̃i      ∀a,                     (12)
                                  Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems               11

where Ũ is an arbitrary, a-independent but possibly time-dependent unitary
transformation, and ga a complex constant. Under this condition, an initially
pure state belonging to Span[{|k̃i}],
                                        X
                               |ψin i =   γk |k̃i,
                                                k

will be DF, since:
                                           X
                     |φa i = Aa |ψin i =        γk ga Ũ|k̃i = ga Ũ|ψin i
                                            k

so               X                   X
        ρout =       Aa ρ̃in A†a =       ga Ũ|ψin ihψin |Ũ† c∗a = Ũ|ψin ihψin |Ũ† ,
                 a                   a

where we used the normalization of the Kraus operators [Eq. (7)] to set a |ga |2 =
                                                                          P
1. This means that the time-evolved state ρout is pure, and its evolution is
governed
       P by Ũ. This argument is easily generalized to an initial mixed state
ρ̃in = kj ρkj |k̃ihj̃|, in which case ρout = Ũρ̃in Ũ† . The unitary transformation
Ũ can be exploited in choosing a driving system Hamiltonian which implements
a useful evolution on the DFS. The calculation above shows that Eq. (9) is a
sufficient condition for a DFS. It follows from the results of Refs. [19, 70] that
it is also a necessary condition for a DFS (under “generic” conditions – to be
explained below).
     A useful alternative formulation of the DFS condition using Kraus operators
can be given, that is slightly less general. Consider a group G = {Gn } and
expandPthe Kraus operators as a linear combination over the group elements:
          N
Aa = n=1 ba,n Gn (i.e., the Kraus operators belong to the group algebra of G).
Then the following theorem gives an alternative DFS characterization [28]:

Theorem 3. If a set of states {|j̃i} belong to a given one-dimensional irrep Γ k
of G, then the DFS condition Aa |j̃i = ca |j̃i holds. If no assumptions are made
on the bath coefficients {ba,n }, then the DFS condition Aa |j̃i = ca |j̃i implies
that |j̃i belongs to a one-dimensional irrep Γ k of G.

    It is not always possible to expand the Kraus operators over a group. How-
ever, when this is possible, the last theorem can be used to find a class of DFSs
under much relaxed symmetry assumptions. This “multiple qubit-errors” model,
introduced in [28] and analyzed for its ability to support universal quantum com-
putation in [41], is discussed in more detail in Section 6.4 below.

5.3   Lindblad-Semigroup Formulation
Let us now consider the conditions for the existence of a DFS in terms of the
Lindblad semigroup master equation (8). The Lindblad equation nicely separates
the unitary and decohering dynamics. It is clear that the DFS condition should
amount to the vanishing of the LD [ρ] term. Let us derive necessary and sufficient
12      Lidar & Whaley

conditions for this to happen, following [26]. Let {|k̃i}N
                                                         k=1 be a basis for an N -
dimensional subspace H̃ ⊆ H. In this basis, we may express states as the density
matrix
                                    XN
                              ρ̃ =      ρkj |k̃ihj̃| .                        (13)
                                          k,j=1

Consider the action of the Lindblad operators on the basis states: Fα |k̃i =
PN α
  j=1 ckj |j̃i. Substituting into Eq. (8) we find


                       M
                    1 X
      LD [ρ(t)] =       aαβ ×
                    2
                      α,β=1
         N                                                                
                ρkj 2cβ∗                                    β∗ α
         X
                          α              β∗ α
                      jm ckn |ñihm̃| − cmn ckn |m̃ihj̃| − cjm cnm |k̃ihñ| = 0.   (14)
      kj,mn=1

The coefficients aαβ represent information about the bath, which we assume
is uncontrollable. Hence we must require that each term in the sum over α, β
vanishes separately. Furthermore, we wish to avoid a dependence on initial con-
ditions, i.e., there should be no dependence on ρkj . This implies that each of the
terms in parentheses must vanish separately. This can only be achieved if there
is just one projection operator |ñihm̃| in each term. The least restrictive choice
leading to this is: cαkn = cαk δkn . Eq. (14) then becomes:

                    N                                               
                            ρkj |k̃ihj̃| 2cβ∗         β∗ α     β∗ α
                    X
                                                α
                                           j kc   − c   c
                                                      k k  − c j c j   = 0.        (15)
                    k,j=1

                                αj    c      c∗
Assuming cαk 6= 0 then yields: cαk + cβk
                                      ∗  = 2. This has to hold in particular for
                                              βj
α = β. With z = cαj /cαk , we then obtain z + 1/z ∗ = 2, which has the unique
solution z = 1. This implies that cαk must be independent of k and therefore
that Fα |k̃i = cα |k̃i, ∀α. We have thus proved (see also [25]):

Theorem 4. If no special assumptions are made on the coefficient matrix aαβ
[Eq. (8)] and on the initial conditions ρij [Eq. (13)] then a necessary and suffi-
cient condition for a subspace H̃ = Span[{|k̃i}N  k=1 ] to be decoherence-free is that
all basis states |k̃i are degenerate eigenstates of all the Lindblad operators {Fα }

                                   Fα |k̃i = cα |k̃i   ∀α, k.                      (16)

     The Lindblad operators can always be closed as a Lie algebra L. We can make
the DFS condition somewhat more explicit in the case of semisimple Lie algebras,
i.e., those which have no Abelian invariant subalgebra [69]. Using Eq. (16) we
have [Fα , Fβ ]|k̃i = 0. If L is semisimple then the commutator can be expressed
                                                  γ
in terms of non-vanishing structure constants fα,β    of the Lie algebra: [Fα , Fβ ] =
PM       γ
   γ=1 fα,β Fγ . We then arrive at the condition on the structure constants
                                   Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems    13


                                  M
                                         γ
                                  X
                                        fα,β cγ = 0       ∀α, β.               (17)
                                  γ=1

The structure constants themselves
                         h        i define the M -dimensional adjoint matrix
                                          γ
representation of L [69]: ad(F̂α )   = fα,β  . Since the generators of the Lie
                                            γ,β
algebra are linearly independent, so must be the matrices of the adjoint repre-
sentation. One can readily show that this is inconsistent with Eq. (17) unless all
cγ = 0. Thus the DFS condition in the case of semisimple Lie algebras is simply

                                       Fα |k̃i = 0 ∀α, k.                      (18)

We will consider examples of this below.

5.4   Quantum Error Correction Formulation
Information encoded in a DFS is immune to errors. In QECC information is
encoded into states which can be perturbed by the environment, but can be re-
covered. Thus DFSs can be viewed as a special type of “degenerate” QECC,
where both the perturbation and recovery are trivial. To formalize this ob-
servation [27, 71], note that quantum error correction can be regarded as the
theory of reversal of quantum operations on a subspace [72]. This subspace,
C = Span[{|iL i}], is interpreted as a “code” (with codewords {|iLi}) which can
be used to protect part of the system Hilbert space against decoherence (or
“errors”) caused by the interaction between system and bath. The errors are
represented by the Kraus operators {Aa } [73]. To decode the quantum informa-
tion after the action of the bath, one introduces “recovery” operators {Rr }. A
QECC is a subspace C and a set of recovery operators {Rr }. Ref. [73] gives two
equivalent criteria for the general condition for QECC. It is possible to correct
the errors induced by a given set of Kraus operators {Aa }, (i) iff
                                             
                                    λra IC 0
                         Rr Aa =                    ∀r, a,                   (19)
                                      0 Bra
or equivalently, (ii) iff
                                                         
                                           γab IC 0
                            A†a Ab =                               ∀a, b.      (20)
                                             0 Ā†a Āb
In both conditions the first block acts on C; Bra and Āa are arbitrary matrices
acting on C ⊥ (H = C ⊕ C ⊥ ). Let us now explore the relation between DFSs and
QECCs. First of all, it is immediate that DFSs are indeed a valid QECC. For,
given the (DFS-) representation of Aa as in Eq. (11), it follows that Eq. (20)
is satisfied with γab = ga∗ gb . Note, however, that unlike the general QECC case
which has a full-rank matrix γab , in the DFS case this matrix has rank 1 (since
the ath row equals row 1 upon multiplication by g1∗ /ga∗ ). A QECC is said to
be non-degenerate if it has full rank [73, 74]. A DFS, therefore, is a completely
14        Lidar & Whaley

degenerate QECC [27, 71]. A related characterization of DFSs is in terms of
distance [75]: a DFS is a QECC with infinite distance [32], meaning essentially
that the errors it is stable against can have arbitrary strength.
    A DFS is an unusual QECC in another way: as we saw above, decoherence
does not affect a perfect DFS at all. Since they are based on a perturbative treat-
ment, other active QECCs (e.g., stabilizer codes [74]) are specifically constructed
to improve the fidelity to a given order in the error rate, which therefore always
allows for some residual decoherence to take place. The absence of decoherence
to any order for a perfect DFS is due to the existence of symmetries in the
system-bath coupling which allow for an exact treatment. These symmetries are
ignored by perturbative QECCs either for the sake of generality, or because they
simply do not exist, as in the case of independent couplings. Given a DFS, the
only errors that can take place involve undesired unitary rotations of codewords
(basis states {|k̃i} of H̃) inside the DFS, due to imprecisions or a bath-induced
Lamb shift. Thus, the complete characterization of DFSs as a QECC is given by
the following [27]:
Theorem 5. Let C be a QECC for error operators {Aa }, with recovery operators
{Rr }. Then C is a DFS iff upon restriction to C, Rr ∝ Ũ†S for all r.

      Proof. First suppose C is a DFS. Then by Eqs. (11) and (19),
                                                     
                              ga ŨS 0       λra IC 0
                        Rr               =                .
                                 0 Āa         0 Bra

To satisfy this equation, it must be true that
                                     λra †      
                                       g  ŨS Cr
                              Rr =      a          ,
                                         Dr Er

where Cr , Dr and Er are arbitrary. Multiplying, the condition ga Dr ŨS = 0
implies Dr = 0 by unitarity of ŨS . Also, since Āa is arbitrary, generically the
condition Cr Āa = 0 implies Cr = 0. Thus upon restriction to C = H̃, indeed
Rr ∝ Ũ†S (by unitarity of ŨS , |λra /ga | = 1). Now suppose Rr ∝ Ũ†S . The very
same argument applied to Aa in Eq. (19) yields Aa ∝ ŨS upon restriction to
C. Since this is exactly the condition defining a DFS in Eq. (11), the theorem is
proved.
    Thus in the sense of reversal of quantum operations on a subspace, DFSs
are a particularly simple instance of general QECCs, where upon restriction to
the code subspace, all recovery operators are proportional to the inverse of the
system evolution operator. Of course, underlying this simplicity is an important
assumption of dynamical symmetry.

5.5     Stabilizer Formulation
A most useful tool in the theory of QECC is the stabilizer formalism [74]. The
stabilizer in QECC is an Abelian subgroup S of the Pauli group (the group
                                 Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems           15

formed by tensor products of Pauli matrices on the qubits). It allows identifica-
tion of the errors the code can correct: The Kraus-operators Aa of Eq. (6) can
be expanded in a basis Ei of “errors”. Two types of errors can be dealt with by
stabilizer codes: (i) errors E†i Ej that anticommute with some S ∈ S, and (ii)
errors that are part of the stabilizer (Ei ∈ S). The first class are errors that
require active correction; the second class (ii) are “degenerate” errors that do
not affect the code at all. A duality between QECCs and DFSs can be stated
as follows: QECCs were designed primarily to deal with type (i) errors, but can
also be regarded as DFSs for the errors in their stabilizer [28, 41]. Conversely,
DFSs were designed primarily to deal with type (ii) errors, but can in principle
be used as a QECC against errors that are type (i) with respect to S. A further
use of the stabilizer is that it allows one to identify sets of fault-tolerant universal
gates for quantum computation [76]. To this end, and to make a more explicit
connection to QECCs, it is useful to recast the DFS condition Eq. (9) into the
stabilizer formalism. By analogy to QECC, we define the DFS stabilizer S as a
set of operators Dβ which act as identity on the DFS states:

                    Dβ |ψi = |ψi ∀Dβ ∈ S         iff    |ψi ∈ DFS.                 (21)

Here β can be a discrete or continuous index; S can form a finite set or group.
This S is therefore a generalization of the QECC stabilizers. While some DFSs
can also be specified by a stabilizer in the Pauli-group [28], many DFSs are
specified by non-Abelian groups, and hence are nonadditive codes [77].
   Consider now the following continuous index stabilizer:
                                                 " A                #
                                                  X
              D(v0 , v1 , ..., vA ) = D(v) = exp     (cα I − Sα ) vα .     (22)
                                                  α=1

Clearly, the DFS condition [Eq. (9)] implies that D(v)|ψi = |ψi. Conversely,
if D(v)|ψi = |ψi for all v, then in particular it must hold that for each α,
exp [(cα I − Sα ) vα ] |ψi = |ψi. Recalling that φ(A) = exp [A] is a one-to-one con-
tinuous mapping of a small neighbourhood of the zero matrix 0 onto a small
neighbourhood of the identity matrix I, it follows that there must be a suffi-
ciently small vα such that (cα I − Sα ) |ψi = 0. Therefore the DFS condition (9)
holds iff D(v)|ψi = |ψi for all v.

5.6   Relative Merits of the Various Formulations
We have given five different formulations of the conditions for a DFS. The OSR
formulation is the most general. The QECC and stabilizer formulations are par-
ticularly useful for constructing logical operations that correspond to quantum
computation inside a DFS. The unifying theme is dynamical symmetry. A DFS
exists if and only if there is a symmetry in the system-bath coupling. This is
made explicit in the Hamiltonian and semigroup formulations, where the error
operators Sα and Fα span a Lie algebra. The DFS condition then reduces to a
search for the one-dimensional irreps of this algebra.
16         Lidar & Whaley

    One may wonder whether the Hamiltonian and semigroup formulations are
equivalent. There is in fact an important difference between the Sα ’s and the Fα ’s
which makes the two decoherence-freeness conditions different. In the Hamilto-
nian formulation of DFSs, the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Thus the expansion for
the interaction Hamiltonian Eq. (4) can always be written such that the Sα are
also Hermitian. On the other hand, the Fα ’s in the master equation, Eq. (8),
need not be Hermitian. Because of this difference, Eq. (16) allows for a broader
range of subspaces than Eq. (9). For example, consider the situation where there
are only two nonzero terms in a master equation for a two-level system, corre-
sponding to F1 = σ− and F2 = σz where σ− = |0ih1| and σz = |0ih0| − |1ih1|
(e.g., cooling with phase damping). In this case there is a DFS corresponding
to the single state |0i. In the Hamiltonian formulation, inclusion of S1 = σ− in
the interaction Hamiltonian expansion Eq. (4) would necessitate a second term
                                  †
in the Hamiltonian with S2 = σ−     = σ+ , along with the Sz = σz as above. For
this set of operators, however, Eq. (9) allows for no DFS.


6      Further Examples of Decoherence-Free Subspaces

6.1      Electromagnetically Induced Transparency2

A simple, previously unpublished example of a situation in which a DFS can
arise is the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [78].
The aspect of EIT that is of interest to us here is the formation of a state that
is immune to spontaneous emission. A concrete physical model is provided by a
tenuous vapor of 3-level atoms in the Λ configuration, e.g., Strontium, contained
in an optical resonator. It is convenient to choose a ring-resonator geometry in
which there are travelling, as opposed to standing, modes. These modes will be
strongly confined, while modes propagating in directions transverse to the ring
path will be essentially unconfined. The atomic levels are denoted by |1i , |2i , |3i,
with energies ε1 ≤ ε2 < ε3 . The transitions (3 ↔ 1) and (3 ↔ 2) are (electric)-
dipole allowed, so (1 ↔ 2) is strongly forbidden (by parity: levels 1 and 2
must have equal parity, opposite to that of level 3). We assume that collisional
broadening can be neglected. In this limit, the only dissipative (decohering)
mechanism is spontaneous emission into the transverse modes. The atoms are
exposed to two laser fields (treated classically). The coupling-laser, with Rabi
frequency ΩC , is slightly detuned from the (3 ↔ 2) transition, and the probe-
laser with Rabi frequency ΩP is slightly detuned from the (3 ↔ 1) transition.
See Fig. 1. However, rather than restricting ourselves to the 3-level atoms case,
suppose that we have an atom with N + 1 levels, denoted by |1i , |2i , ..., |N + 1i,
with energies ε1 ≤ ε2 < ... < εN +1 , such that the transitions (N + 1 ↔ i), with
i = 1..N are allowed, but (i ↔ j), with i, j ∈ {1, ..., N }, are strongly forbidden.
This is an artificial model whose purpose is to illustrate the appearance of a
large DFS. The standard EIT case is recovered by letting N = 2.

      We are indebted to Dr. J.C. Garrison for first suggesting the 3-level version of this
     example in Dec. 1998.

    The effective system Hamiltonian is found by (a) transforming to the interac-
tion picture, (b) imposing the rotating-wave approximation, (c) a further trans-
formation to remove the remaining explicit time dependence from the Hamilto-

where the transition operators {Tab } are defined by

                       Tab = |ai hb| ,    (a, b ∈ {1, ..., N + 1}),

Ωi is the Rabi frequency of a laser field coupling levels |ii and |N + 1i, ∆ =
Ωi − ωN +1,i is the coupling laser detuning (assumed independent of i), and
δi = Ωi+1 − Ωi − ωi+1,i is the Raman detuning. In standard EIT Ω1 = ΩP and
Ω 2 = ΩC .
    Decoherence is described in this model by spontaneous emission from the
excited state |N + 1i to any of the lower lying states |ii, where i = 1..N . It is this
decoherence process that we wish to avoid. Thus the relevant Lindblad operators
{Fα } are {Ti,N +1 } and the aαβ matrix of Eq. (8) is diagonal: aii = AN +1,i , where
AN +1,i is the Einstein A -coefficient for the spontaneous transition from |N + 1i
to |ii. The DFS condition, Eq. (16), now tells us that if |ψi ∈H̃, then

                                   Ti,N +1 |ψi = ci |ψi .                         (24)
18        Lidar & Whaley

However, note that while the operators {Tij } (i, j = 1..N + 1) generate the full
semisimple Lie algebra su (N + 1), the N operators {Ti,N +1 } appearing in the
decoherence term of the Lindblad equation, commute. They span the Abelian
Cartan subalgebra [generally su (N + 1) has an N -dimensional Cartan subalge-
bra, defined as the maximal set of commuting generators] [69]. This algebra is
not semisimple (since it is an Abelian invariant subalgebra of itself) and the DFS
theorem does not tell us what the {ci } are. However, a direct way to see this is
to calculate the scalar product of (24) with itself (i 6= j ):

             c∗j ci = hψ|T†j,N +1 Ti,N +1 |ψi =hψ|N + 1ihj|iihN + 1|ψi = 0,           (25)

so that either ci = 0, or cj = 0, or both. Suppose cj = 0; then by Eq. (24) the
most general form |ψi can have is:
                                                   N
                                                   X
                                           |ψi =         aj |ji,                      (26)
                                                   j=1

i.e., |ψi cannot have a component |N + 1i: hN + 1|ψi = 0. Thus ci = 0 for all i.
This result for the allowed DFS states is intuitively obvious: since spontaneous
emission takes place only from level N + 1, the DF states are those which do not
contain an |N + 1i component.
     Let us now take into account the requirement that the DFS be invariant
under the system Hamiltonian. Invariance implies Tk,N +1 (HS |ψi) = 0, so that
by Eq. (24), a necessary condition is

                                       [Tk,N +1 , HS ]|ψi = 0.                        (27)

Noting that [Tk,N +1 , Tij ] = δi,N +1 |kihj| − δjk |iihN + 1|, we can evaluate the
commutator in Eq. (27) as follows:
                         N
                         X
     [Tk,N +1 , HS ] =         (∆ + δi )[Tk,N +1 , Tii ]
                         i=1
                            N
                         1X
                    −          Ωi [Tk,N +1 , Ti,N +1 ] + Ωi [Tk,N +1 , TN +1,i ]
                         2 i=1
                           N
                           X
                    =−           (∆ + δi )δik |iihN + 1|
                           i=1
                            N
                         1X
                    +          Ωi δN +1,k |iihN + 1| + Ωi (δik |N + 1ihN + 1| − |kihi|) .
                         2 i=1

Using hN + 1|ψi = 0, we obtain:
                                             "N           #
                                            1 X
                     [Tk,N +1 , HS ]|ψi = −       Ωi hi|ψi |ki = 0.                   (28)

                                   Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems           19

This leads to a generalized EIT condition:
                                    N
                                    X
                                           Ωi hψ|ii = 0,                             (29)
                                     i=1

which expresses a destructive interference between all N lower lying levels. The
corresponding superposition suffers no spontaneous emission, and is preserved
under its system Hamiltonian. The standard EIT condition, for N = 2, is

                               ΩP hψ |1i + ΩC hψ |2i = 0                             (30)

also known as the dark-state-condition [78].
     The N − 2 dimensional DFS defined by Eqs. (26),(29) may be useful for
quantum memory applications. However, it is not clear how to make use of
this DFS for quantum computing applications, since all states in this DFS are
degenerate eigenvectors of HS , so that the evolution inside the DFS is trivial,
i.e., a global phase.3 This further implies that the Raman detunings δj must all
vanish in order for the DFS to be preserved under HS . Finally, the symmetry that
characterizes this EIT-DFS is the coupling of all spontaneous emission operators
to a common excited state. A DFS would not exist if all levels were radiatively
coupled to each other.

6.2    Spin Boson Model with Strong Collective Decoherence
A beautiful example of a DFS with applications to quantum computing comes
from the spin-boson model [82]. This DFS example was proposed by Zanardi
and Rasetti in the influential paper [18]. Consider N spins interacting with a
bosonic field via the Hamiltonian
                 N X
                 X                                                              
          HI =              + +
                           gi,k            − −
                                σi ⊗ bk + gi,k σi ⊗ b†k + gi,k
                                                           z
                                                               σiz ⊗ (bk + b†k ) .   (31)
                 i=1   k

Here {σi+ , σi− , σiz } are Pauli operators acting on the ith spin, bk (b†k ) is an an-
nihilation (creation) operator for the k th bosonic mode, and gi,k   α
                                                                          are coupling
constants. The Hamiltonian HI describes a rather general interaction between
a system of qubits (the spins) and a bath of bosons, exchanging energy through
the σi+ ⊗ bk and σi− ⊗ b†k terms, and changing phase through the σiz ⊗ (bk + b†k )
term. As it stands HI does not support a DFS: there are 3N Sα operators when
comparing to Eq. (4), i.e., the N triples of local sl(2) algebras {σi+ , σi− , σiz }; each
such algebra acts on a single qubit, and therefore
                                                LN     has a two-dimensional irrep.
The overall action of the total Lie algebra i=1 sli (2) is represented by the ir-
reducible N -fold tensor product of all local two-dimensional irreps. This implies
that there are no one-dimensional irreps as required by Eq. (9), and hence no
DFS.
3
    This issue has been studied in detail and further generalized by Bacon to other
    multi-level atom spectra [81].
20      Lidar & Whaley

   The situation changes dramatically when a permutation symmetry is imposed
on the system-bath interaction, in the form
                                      α
                                     gi,k ≡ gkα .                                (32)

This “collective decoherence” situation is relevant in a number of solid-state
quantum computing proposals, in particular those where decoherence due to
interaction with a cold phonon bath is dominant. At low temperatures only
long-wavelength phonons survive (since there is an energy gap for excitation of
high-energy/short-wavelength phonons), and the model of collective decoherence
becomes relevant provided the qubit spacing is small compared to the phonon
wavelength. Another prototypical situation is the Dicke model in quantum optics
[83], discussed in more detail below.
    Given the collective
                      PNdecoherence assumption, one can define three collective
spin operators Sα = i=1 σiα so that the Hamiltonian becomes
                                      X
                             HI =         Sα ⊗ Bα ,
                                     α=+,−,z


where B+ = k gk+ σi+ ⊗ bk , B− = B†+ and Bz = k gi,k         σi ⊗ (bk + b†k ). In fact
              P                                       P z z
the specific form of the bath operators Bα is irrelevant. The important point
is that the system operators Sα now form a global sl(2) angular momentum
algebra, i.e., [S+ , S− ] = Sz and [Sz , S± ] = 2S± , with a highly reducible 2N ×
2N representation formed by its action on all N qubits at once. We refer to
the case of a global sl(2) algebra as “strong collective decoherence”; the case
of collective phase damping discussed in Section 3 corresponds to having just
a single global angular momentum operator (Sz ) and is referred to as “weak
collective decoherence” [36]. Since sl(2) is semisimple Eq. (9) now tells us that
the DFS is made up of those states |ψi satisfying

                                 Sα |ψi = 0         ∀α.

These are the states with vanishing total (fictitious) angular momentum J, i.e.,
the “singlets” of sl(2). Their explicit form is well known for the case N = 2, in
which case there is only one singlet:
                                1
              |ψiN =2 ≡ |si12 = √ (|01i − |10i) = |J = 0, mJ = 0i
                                 2
where the notation |si12 should be read as “singlet state of qubits 1 and 2”.
This is also known as a Bell state or EPR pair [3]. The final form uses the total
angular momentum J and its projection mJ . It is easy to check that the state
                                       N/2
                                       O
                              |ψiN =         |si2m−1,2m
                                       m=1

is in the N -qubit DFS (since adding pairwise |J = 0, mJ = 0i states again
produced a state with total J = 0), and that there are no DFS states for N
                                 Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems           21

odd (since such a state always has half-integer total J). The method of Young
tableaux can be used to derive a dimensionality formula [18, 84]:

                                                 N!
                         dim[DFS(N )] =                                            (33)
                                           (N/2 + 1)!(N/2)!

is the number of singlet states for N qubits. An interesting consequence is that
the encoding efficiency ǫ of the DFS, defined as the number of logical qubits
log2 dim[DFS(N )] per number of physical qubits N , tends asymptotically to
unity [18]:
                                N →∞     3 log2 N
                              ǫ −→ 1 −            .
                                         2 N
There are several methods for calculating the singlet states for arbitrary N ,
e.g., by solving the problem using linear algebra, using group representation
theory, or by using angular momentum addition rules. To illustrate the latter,
consider the case of N = 4. The dimensionality formula yields dim[DFS(4)] = 2,
meaning that this DFS encodes one logical qubit. One of the states is |0L i ≡
|ψi4 = |si12 ⊗ |si34 . The second, orthogonal, state must be a combination of the
triplet states |t− i ≡ |00i = |J = 1, mJ = −1i, |t+ i ≡ |11i = |J = 1, mJ = 1i,
|t0 i ≡ √12 (|01i + |10i) = |J = 1, mJ = 0i. Indeed, the combination |1L i =
√1 (|t− i12 ⊗ |t+ i34 − |t0 i12 ⊗ |t0 i34 + |t+ i12 ⊗ |t− i34 ) clearly has total J = 0,
  3
and has the correct Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. In this manner one can con-
struct total J = 0 states for progressively higher N .
     The encoding which we just discussed, of logical qubits into blocks of four
spins each, was used to provide the first constructive procedure for universal,
fault tolerant quantum computation using DFSs. As shown by Bacon et al. [85],
universality can be achieved by switching on/off only Heisenberg exchange in-
teractions between pairs of spins. This established for the first time that the
Heisenberg interaction is all by itself universal for quantum computation. This
observation is very important for a class of solid-state quantum computing pro-
posals, such as electron spins in quantum dots [86] and donor atom spins in Si
[87], where it is technically preferable to have to control only a single interaction.
The universality of the Heisenberg interaction was further proved for encodings
into any number N ≥ 3 of spins in [36]. Explicit pulse sequences for the N = 3
case were derived in [88]. Furthermore, the collective decoherence conditions
can be created from arbitrary linear system-bath interaction Hamiltonians, us-
ing strong and fast pulses of the Heisenberg interaction [61], and leakage from
a DFS can be detected using a Heisenberg-only circuit [89], or prevented using
Heisenberg-only pulses [62].


6.3   DFS and Dicke subradiance

A different physical situation in which DFSs arise as a consequence of a collective
coupling to the environment appears in the context of the Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian for N identical two-level atoms coupled to a single mode radiation
22         Lidar & Whaley

field. The Hamiltonian is very similar to that of Eq. (31), namely
                                  N
                                  X
                                         gi+ σi+ ⊗ b + gi− σi− ⊗ b†
                                                                      
                           HI =                                                         (34)
                                   i=1

When the atoms are closer together than the wavelength of the radiation field,
then the coupling parameter gi becomes independent of the atom index       P i, and
one can write Eq. (34) in terms of the collective spin operators S+ = N            +
                                                                              i=1 σi
            PN −
and S− = i=1 σi . The DFS condition may be applied directly in the Hamilto-
nian formulation. Together, these two conditions on the N -particle atomic states
are equivalent to the single condition S|ψi = 0 that we derived above for the
collective decoherence of the spin-boson model in the strong coupling situation
(i.e., α = 1, 2, and 3). With the atomic states alone, we therefore similarly arrive
at a set of DF states that are identified with the N -atom singlet states. This
model was also treated extensively in [20–22, 25].
    The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian is important also in the context of the
Dicke states of quantum optics [83], where the motivation is very different from
ours. The Dicke states are collective atomic states that are useful in consideration
of the treatment of radiation by a collection of N two-level atoms. Let m ≡
1
2 [(number of atoms in the excited state) − (number in the ground state)]. The
Dicke states are defined as eigenstates of the collective angular momentum, itself
defined by S2 = S2x + S2y + S2z , with eigenvalues |m| ≤ J ≤ N/2, where the
effective total angular momentum J is referred to by Dicke as the “cooperation
number” [83, 90]. Dicke showed that the rate of photon emission is given by
Γ = A(J + m)(J − m + 1), where A is the single-atom Einstein coefficient.
Dicke’s interest was primarily in the “superradiant” states with J = N/2 and
m = 0. In this case the rate of emission is proportional to N 2 , which is unusual
since it implies that the radiation from a partially excited atomic system (m = 0)
can be much higher than that from a fully excited system (m = N/2). It also
follows that there are “anti-superradiant”, or “subradiant” states, with Γ = 0,
corresponding to the situations m = −J and J = m = 0 [83, 90].4 Evidence of
this behavior has been obtained experimentally for trapped ions [91]. The case
J = m = 0 coincides with that of a DFS spanned by singlet states. However, one
should not conclude that DFSs are nothing but Dicke’s subradiant states. First
of all, there is a major conceptual difference, since in DFS theory we consider the
radiation field as an external environment, while in Dicke’s analysis the notion of
4
      It is important to distinguish subradiant states from “dark” states, which are also
     well known in quantum optics [79, p.824]. A dark state is a special dressed super-
     position state of the excited states of a single atom that is not dipole coupled to
     the ground state of the atom even if the undressed excited states themselves are. A
     dark state is usually defined in terms of stationary light fields coupled to separate
     transitions with a common ground state. It is created if the detunings δi = ǫi − ωi of
     the two light fields with frequencies ωi from their respective transition frequencies ǫi
     in a V or Λ configuration are equal. Note the similarity to the “dark-state condition”
     of EIT, Eq. (30), where equal detunings were also assumed, albeit at the level of Rabi
     frequencies.
                                Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems        23

an environment did not play a central role. In fact the explanation of subradiance
is straightforward: the atomic dipoles are oppositely phased in pairs, so that the
field radiated by one atom is absorbed by another [90]. This effect was already
observed in 1970 with atoms close to a metallic mirror [92]: the mirror image of
one atom behaves as a second radiator in antiphase with the first. Secondly, the
DFS conditions given in Section 5 are far more general than the Dicke states.
This will become even more apparent in our discussion on DF subsystems, in
Section 7. Within the formal analysis provided by the DFS conditions the Dicke
states appear naturally as those states that are isolated against any interactions
with the radiation field.
    To further emphasize the distinction between Dicke states and DFS theory,
we consider an interesting extension of these collective atomic states, that results
when one incorporates the single field mode into the system, and distinguishes
this from an external environment of other radiation modes. This is the situation
relevant to a set of N atoms interacting with a single mode in a high-finesse
optical cavity, where this single cavity mode couples to a free radiation field: the
prototypical situation in cavity-QED [80]. The Hamiltonian is now
                N
                X                                X −              †
                                                                        

and the system-environment interaction consists only of the second sum, since
the atom-cavity mode interaction is now within the expanded system of atom
plus cavity mode. In this case we find a single DFS condition, b|ψi|ni ∝ |ψi|ni
where |ψi is the collective atomic state |ni is the cavity number state. This
condition implies that b|ni = 0, i.e., the cavity mode must be empty, but does
not otherwise place any restrictions on the atomic component of the system state.
It is only when one imposes a further requirement that the system Hamiltonian
not cause system states to evolve outside the DFS that one arrives at specific
atomic states. In particular, this requirement tells us that both S+ b and S− b†
act on |ψi|0i to produce at most another state |ψ ′ i|0i. Since b|0i = 0, the first
condition is trivially satisfied, while the second condition reduces to S− |ψi = 0
because b† |0i = |1i which would take the joint state outside the DFS. Thus the
requirement for a DFS of the coupled N atom/cavity system is simply S− |ψi = 0,
with a zero cavity occupation number. The atomic component of this DFS state
is equal to the lowest Dicke state |J, −Ji, which constitute the ground state
for a given cooperation number J [90]. For N = 2 we find a two-dimensional
DFS given √ by the atomic states |J = 1, m = −1i = |00i and |J = 0, m =
0i = (1/ 2)[|10i − |01i] (combined of course with the zero cavity mode state
|n = 0i). The corresponding DFS for higher values of N may be readily generated
using angular momentum algebra, as described in [90]. The dimensionality of
these atom/cavity DFS differ from that of collective decoherence given above
[Eq. (33)], being given by the expression

                                            (2J + 1)N !
                   dim[DFS(NJ )] =                                             (36)
                                      (N/2 + J + 1)!(N/2 − J)!
24      Lidar & Whaley

which reduces to Eq. (33) when J = 0. Proposals for employing qubits encoded
into these atom/cavity DFSs have been made recently by Beige et al., including
discussion of performing quantum computation on the states using the quantum
Zeno effect [46, 47].


6.4   Multiple Qubit Errors

The collective decoherence example assumes that all qubits couple to the bath
in a symmetric manner, which is the consequence of full permutational symme-
try. However, the symmetry that gives rise to a DFS can be less strict. Con-
sider the case of N = 4 qubits which can undergo bit flips σjx : |0ij ←→ |1ij .
Suppose that the qubits are arranged in pairs, such that the bit flip error af-
fects at least two at a time. Specifically, let the allowed errors be QX (4) =
{I, σ1x σ2x , σ3x σ4x , σ1x σ2x σ3x σ4x }, where I is the identity operator (no error). Note
that the error σ2x σ3x is assumed not to happen. A general error in this model is
a Kraus operator formed by an arbitrary linear combination of the elements of
(the Abelian group) QX (4). It is then simple to verify that the encoding

                            1
                  |0L 0L i =  (|0000i + |1100i + |0011i + |1111i)
                            2
                            1
                  |0L 1L i = (|0001i + |1101i + |0010i + |1110i)
                            2
                            1
                  |1L 0L i = (|0100i + |1000i + |0111i + |1011i)
                            2
                            1
                  |1L 1L i = (|1001i + |0101i + |1010i + |0110i)
                            2
is a 4-dimensional DFS (denoted DF SQX (4) ), thus encoding two logical qubits.
To see this, check that all states in DF SQX (4) are eigenstates with the same
eigenvalue +1 of any linear combination of operators over QX (4). This means
that the action of the errors in QX (4) is to leave the subspace DF SQX (4) in-
variant, so that this subspace is DF, in accordance with Theorem 3 and the
more general Theorem 2. The latter theorem, however, only requires that the
Kraus operators have an identical unitary representation on the DFS, which
means that eigenvalues other than +1 are possible in principle. Indeed, it is
simple to check that the state (|0000i − |1100i + |0011i − |1111i)/2 belongs to
another 4 -dimensional DFS, characterized by the eigenvalue −1. In fact the
entire 16-dimensional Hilbert space splits up into four 4-dimensional DFSs, two
with eigenvalue +1, two with eigenvalue −1.
    In order to generalize this result, note that the group QX (4) is generated
(under multiplication) by σ1x σ2x and σ3x σ4x ; clearly the group QX (N ) generated
      x     x N/2
by {σ2j−1 σ2j }j=1 also supports a DFS with the same defining property, namely
that the DF states are simultaneous eigenstates of all QX (N ) generators.
    Even more generally, the type of DFS considered here is an example of a
DFS for multiple qubit errors. The general theory is worked out in [28]. The er-
ror model can be stated abstractly as follows: Starting from the Pauli group on N
                                 Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems           25

qubits (the group of N -fold tensor products of the Pauli matrices {σx , σy , σz }),
look for Abelian subgroups. Every such subgroup defines an error model, in the
sense that linear combinations of elements of the subgroup form Kraus opera-
tors. The physical motivation for such subgroups is: (i) The case in which either
only higher order (multiple qubit) errors occur, such that first-order terms of the
form I ⊗ · · · ⊗ I ⊗ σiα ⊗ I ⊗ · · · ⊗ I are absent in the Pauli-group expansion of the
Kraus operators, or (ii) only errors of one kind, either σ x , σ y , or σ z take place.
Case (i) would imply that there are certain cancellations involving bath matrix
element terms such that first-order system operators are absent in the expansion
of Eq. (6). While this would be a rather non-generic situation, involving a very
special “friendly” bath, it turns out that such conditions can be actively gen-
erated from arbitrary baths using fast and strong, dynamical decoupling pulses
[61]. Alternatively, in case (i) the system-bath Hamiltonian does not have the
general form of Eq. (4), but rather involves only second order terms such as
σiα ⊗ σjβ (identity on all the rest). Case (ii) is applicable in, e.g., the case of pure
phase damping (relevant to NMR [93]) and optical lattices using cold controlled
collisions [94]), where σ z errors are dominant. When either condition (i) or (ii)
above is satisfied, the subgroup is Abelian, which is a necessary condition for it to
have one-dimensional irreps. This, in turn, is a necessary and sufficient condition
for a DFS by Theorem 2. Thus, to every such multiple qubit error model there
corresponds a DFS, which is found by studying the one-dimensional irreps of
the subgroup over N qubits. The DFS basis states are states that transform ac-
cording to a one-dimensional irrep with fixed eigenvalue. The dimension of such
a DFS therefore turns out to be the multiplicity of the one-dimensional irreps
of the subgroup. The result seen above for QX (4) is general: the entire Hilbert
space splits up into equi-dimensional, independent DFSs [28]. It is also possible
to perform universal, fault tolerant quantum computation on these DFSs, by
using a hybrid DFS-QECC method [41]. An experimental magnetic resonance
realization of DF quantum computation, implementing Grover’s algorithm in
the presence of multiple-qubit errors, has recently been completed [58].


7    Decoherence-Free (Noiseless) Subsystems

As long as we restrict our attention to encoding quantum information in a DF
manner over a subspace then Eqs. (9),(16) provide necessary and sufficient con-
ditions for the existence of such DFSs. The notion of a subspace which remains
DF throughout the evolution of a system is not, however, the most general
method for providing DF encoding of information in a quantum system. Knill,
Laflamme, and Viola [32] discovered a method for DF encoding into subsystems
instead of into subspaces. Zanardi soon thereafter realized that this opened the
door to a unification of many of the previously seemingly unrelated ideas for
reducing decoherence [37]. Related, less general results were independently de-
rived in [33, 34]. Kempe et al. developed a general theory of universal quantum
computation based on the DF subsystems concept [36].
26     Lidar & Whaley

7.1   Formal Theory

We first introduce a formal characterization of DF subsystems. This is most
easily done in the Hamiltonian formulation of decoherence. Let A denote the
associative algebra (i.e., the algebra of all polynomials) generated by the system
Hamiltonian HS and the system components of the interaction Hamiltonian,
the Sα ’s of Eq. (4). We assume that HS is expressed in terms of the Sα ’s as
well (if needed we can always enlarge this set), and that the identity operator
is included as S0 = IS and B0 = IB . This will have no observable consequence
but allows for the use of an important representation theorem. Because the
Hamiltonian is Hermitian the Sα ’s must be closed under Hermitian conjugation:
A is a “†-closed” operator algebra. A basic theorem of such operator algebras
which include the identity operator states that, in general, A will be a reducible
subalgebra of the full algebra of operators on the system Hilbert space HS [95].
This means that the algebra is isomorphic to a direct sum of dJ × dJ complex
matrix algebras M(dJ ), each with multiplicity nJ :

                             A∼
                                  M
                              =         InJ ⊗ M(dJ ).                        (37)
                                  J∈J

Here J is a finite set labeling the irreducible components of A.
   The structure implied by Eq. (37) is illustrated schematically as follows, for
some system operator Sα :
                                                       
                                J =1

                        Sα =                                               (38)
                                                       

                                                J = |J |

In this block diagonal matrix representation, a typical block with given J, may

Here λ labels the different degenerate sub-blocks, and µ labels the states in-
side each sub-block. Associated with this decomposition of the algebra A is the
                               Decoherence-Free Subspaces and Subsystems       27

decomposition over the system Hilbert space:
                                    X
                             HS =           CnJ ⊗ CdJ .                      (40)
                                    J∈J


DF subsystems are defined as the situation in which information is encoded in
a single component CnJ of Eq. (40) (thus the dimension of the DF subsystem
is nJ ). The decomposition in Eq. (37) reveals that information encoded in such
a subsystem will always be affected as identity on the component CnJ , and thus
this information will not decohere. This deep fact is the basis for the theory of
DF subsystems.
    Several general observations are in order: (i) The tensor product structure
which gives rise to the name subsystem in Eq. (37) is a tensor product over a
direct sum, and therefore will not in general correspond to the natural tensor
product of (spatially distinguishable) qubits; (ii) The subsystem nature of the
decoherence implies that the information should be encoded in a separable way:
over the tensor structure of Eq. (40) the density matrix should split into two
valid density matrices: ρS (0) = ρ ⊗ γ where ρ is the DF subsystem and γ is the
corresponding component of the density matrix which does decohere; (iii) Not
all of the subsystems in the different irreducible representations can be simul-
taneously used: (phase) decoherence will occur between the different irreducible
components of the Hilbert space labeled by J ∈ J . For this reason, from now
on we restrict our attention to the subsystem defined by a given J.
    DF subspaces are now easily connected to DF subsystems. DF subspaces cor-
respond to those DF subsystems possessing one-dimensional irreducible matrix
algebras: M(1). The multiplicity of these one-dimensional irreducible algebras is
the dimension of the DF subspaces. In fact it is easy to see how the DF subsys-
tems arise out of a non-commuting generalization of the DF subspace conditions.
Let {|λµ i}, 1 ≤ λ ≤ nJ and 1 ≤ µ ≤ dJ , denote a subsystem of HS with given
J. Then the condition for the existence of an irreducible decomposition as in
Eq. (37) is
                                        dJ
                                        X
                           Sα |λµ i =           Mµµ′ ,α |λµ′ i,              (41)
                                        µ′ =1

for all Sα , λ and µ. Note that Mµµ′ ,α is not dependent on λ, in the same way
that cα in Eq. (9) is the same for all states |k̃i (there µ = 1 and fixed). Thus
for a fixed λ, the subsystem spanned by |λµ i is acted upon in some nontrivial
way. However, because Mµµ′ ,α is not dependent on λ, each subsystem defined
by a fixed µ and running over λ is acted upon in an identical manner by the
decoherence process.
    The generalization of the Lindblad semigroup formulation of the DF sub-
space condition to the corresponding master equation for a DF subsystem is not
trivial. This is because the Fα operators in Eq. (8) are not required to be closed
under conjugation. The representation theorem Eq. (37) is hence not directly ap-
plicable. It can be shown, however, that the master equation analog of Eq. (41)
28        Lidar & Whaley
              Pd
is: Fα |λµ i = µJ′ =1 Mµµ′ ,α |λµ′ i, and provides a necessary and sufficient condi-
tion for the preservation of DF subsystems. For details the reader is referred to
[36, p.5].
     As noted before, the subsystems concept is crucial in establishing a general
theory of universal, fault tolerant quantum computation over DFSs. To this end
it is necessary to introduce the commutant A′ of A. This is the set of operators
which commutes with the algebra A, A′ = {X : [X, A] = 0, ∀A ∈ A}. They also
form a †-closed algebra, which is reducible to
                                       M
                               A′ =       M(nJ ) ⊗ IdJ                          (42)
                                        J∈J

over the same basis as A in Eq. (37). Comparing to Eq. (37) it is clear that
non-trivial operators in A′ are exactly the transformations that preserve the
DFS [35]. As shown in detail in [36], this allows for a constructive proof that the
Heisenberg exchange interaction is universal over all DFS encodings for collective
decoherence.

7.2     Examples
To illustrate the DF states that emerge from the subsystems formulation it is
convenient to use once more the collective decoherence model. As will be recalled
from Section 6.2, “strong” collective decoherence on N qubits is characterized by
the three system operators S+ , S− and Sz . These operators form a representation
of the semisimple Lie algebra sl(2). The algebra A generated by these operators
can be decomposed as5
                                      N/2
                              A∼
                                      M
                               =               InJ ⊗ gl(2J + 1)                          (43)
                                   J=0(1/2)

where J labels the total angular momentum of the corresponding Hilbert space
decomposition (and hence the 0 or 1/2 depending on whether N is even or odd
respectively) and gl(2J + 1) is the general linear algebra acting on a space of
size 2J + 1. The resulting decomposition of the system Hilbert space
                                         N/2
                               HS ∼
                                         M
                                  =              CnJ ⊗ C2J+1                             (44)
                                      J=0(1/2)

is exactly the reduction of the Hilbert states into different Dicke states [83, 90].
The degeneracy for each J is therefore given by Eq. (36). Eq. (43) shows that
given J, a state |J, λ, µi is acted upon as identity on its λ component. Thus a
DFS is defined by fixing J and µ, where µ can now be naturally interpreted as
the z-component of the projection of the total angular momentum. As we will
show shortly, λ corresponds to the degeneracy of paths leading to a given node
5
     Note that as a complex algebra {S+ , S− , Sz } span all of gl(2), not just sl(2).

(N, J) on the diagram of Fig. (2). In the strong collective decoherence case, we
shall denote the N -qubit DFS labeled by a particular angular momentum J, by
DF SN (J).
    The DFSs corresponding to the different J values for a given N can be
computed using standard methods for the addition of angular momentum. We
use the convention that |1i represents a |j = 1/2, mj = 1/2i particle and |0i
represents a |j = 1/2, mj = −1/2i particle in this decomposition although, of
course, one should be careful to treat this labeling as strictly symbolic and not
related to the physical angular momentum of the particles.
    The smallest N which supports a DFS and encodes at least a qubit of in-
formation is N = 3 [32–34]. In this case there are two possible values of the
total angular momentum: J = 3/2 or J = 1/2. The four J = 3/2 states
|J, λ, µi = |3/2, 0, µi (µ = mJ = ±3/2, ±1/2) are singly degenerate; the J = 1/2
states have degeneracy 2. They can be constructed by either adding a J12 = 1
(triplet) or a J12 = 0 (singlet) state to a J3 = 1/2 state. These two possible
methods of adding the angular momentum to obtain a J = 1/2 state are exactly
the degeneracy of the algebra. The four J = 1/2 states are:

                       | 12 , 0, 21 i = √12 (|010i − |100i)
                       | 21 , 0, − 21 i = √12 (|011i − |101i)
                       | 12 , 1, 0i = √16 (−2|001i + |010i + |100i)
                       | 12 , 1, 1i = √16 (2|110i − |101i − |011i)

where on the left we used the |J, λ, µi notation and on the right the states are
expanded in terms the single-particle |j = 1/2, mj = ±1/2i basis using Clebsch-
Gordan coefficients. The DF qubit can now be written compactly as

                       |0L i = α|1/2, 0, 1/2i + β|1/2, 0, −1/2i
                       |1L i = α|1/2, 1, 1/2i + β|1/2, 1, −1/2i                 (45)

where |α|2 + |β|2 = 1, i.e., the encoding is into the degeneracy of the two J = 1/2
subsystems. By the the decomposition of Eqs. (43),(44) it is clear that collective
errors can change the α, β coefficients, but have the same effect on the |0L i, |1L i
states, which is why this encoding is a DFS.
    The smallest DF subspace (as opposed to subsystem) supporting a full en-
coded qubit comes about for n = 4. Subspaces for the strong collective decoher-
ence mechanism correspond to the degeneracy of the zero total angular momen-
tum eigenstates (there are also two DF subsystems with degeneracy 1 and 3).
As we already noted in Section 6.2 this subspace is spanned by the states:
                                             1
     |0L i = |0, 0, 0i = |0, 0i ⊗ |0, 0i =     |(|01i − |10i)(|01i − |10i)
                                             2
                          1
     |1L i = |0, 1, 0i = √ (|1, 1i ⊗ |1, −1i − |1, 0i ⊗ |1, 0i + |1, −1i ⊗ |1, 1i)
                           3
               1
           = √ (2|0011i + 2|1100i − |0101i − |1010i − |0110i − |1001i). (46)
                12
30      Lidar & Whaley

The notation is the same as in Eq. (45), except that in the third equality we
have used the notation |J12 , mJ12 i ⊗ |J34 , mJ34 i which makes it easy to see how
the angular momentum is added.




Fig. 2. Partitioning of the Hilbert space of N spin-1/2 particles into DF subspaces
(nodes on the N -axis) and subsystems (nodes above the N -axis). Integer above a node
represents the number of paths leading from the origin to that node, i.e., the degeneracy
quantum number λ. See text for full details.


    There is a simple graphical interpretation of these results, shown in Fig. (2).
Starting from the origin (no spins) one starts adding spin-1/2 particles. The
first particle (N = 1) has total angular momentum J = 1/2. This single particle
has the trivial DF S1 (1/2). When the second particle is added one can form
either a singlet (J = 0) by subtracting 1/2 or form a triplet by adding 1/2.
In this manner the subspace DF S2 (0) and subsystem DF S2 (1) are formed,
containing a single state (µ = mJ = 0) and three states (µ = mJ = −1, 0, 1),
respectively. The first interesting DFS is formed when N = 3, since now there
are two paths, λ = 0, 1, in Fig. (2) leading to the same total J = 1/2. These
two paths correspond exactly to the |0L i and |1L i states of Eq. (45), and define
the subsystem DF S3 (1/2), that encodes a single DF qubit. For N = 4 spins
there is the DF subspace DF S4 (0) and also a three-dimensional DF subsystem
DF S4 (1). Clearly, the DF subspaces are simply all the nodes that lie on the
N -axis in Fig. (2), while the DF subsystems are all the nodes above this axis.
Interpreted in this manner, Fig. (2) is a partitioning of the entire system Hilbert
space into disjoint DFSs. The examples presented here have been worked out
in far greater detail in [36, 81, 96], where it is further shown how to construct
universal quantum computation operations using the same formalism.

8    Protection against additional decoherence sources

It is clear from the above summary of DF subspaces and subsystems that they
will afford complete protection against the specific errors that they are designed
to eliminate. However, in general it is not possible to protect agains all kinds of
errors and one is motivated to then consider how to add protection of DFS en-
codings agains additional sources of decoherence. Several approaches have been
taken to address this issue. It was shown early on that DFSs are remarkably
stable to additional sources of decoherence, providing a useful point of depar-
ture for more general schemes to protect fragile quantum information. The first
study to consider the effects of perturbations breaking the symmetry giving rise
to a DFS was Ref. [26], within the Markovian semigroup formulation. It was
shown that if an additional set of Lindblad operators are added to the Lind-
blad equation (8), parametrized by a coupling strength ǫ, then the “mixed state
fidelity” fǫ (t) ≡ Tr[ρid (t)ρǫ (t)], i.e., the overlap between the ideal (decoherence-
free) evolution ρid (t) and the perturbed evolution ρǫ (t), decays as 1−O(ǫt2 ). This
conclusion was significantly strengthened in Ref. [39], where a stability analysis
was made within both the semigroup and OSR formulations. It was shown that
in both formulations states in DFSs are stable to symmetry-breaking perturba-
tions to second order in the strength of the perturbation: fǫ (t) = 1 − O(ǫ2 t2 ), so
the entire O(ǫ) contribution vanishes to all orders in time. This indicates that
the DFSs are well-suited for applications to quantum memory, a result that has
been recently been taken advantage of in ion traps [50, 52, 55, 56]. Errors that
do occur can be dealt with by a number of methods: (i) Additional encoding
[27, 43–45, 84], (ii) Implementing error-detection circuits [89]; (iii) Hamiltonian
engineering to suppress or eliminate further errors [42]; (iv) Combination with
the dynamical decoupling technique [49, 50, 61, 62, 97, 98]. We briefly summarize
instances of these four approaches here.
    In the collective decoherence DFS, independent single qubit errors can be
shown to cause either independent errors acting on the encoded qubit states, or
leakage of the DFS encoded qubit states to states lying outside the DFS [27].
Both of these types of errors may be corrected by concatenating the DFS en-
coding with a standard quantum error-correcting code that corrects independent
single qubit errors. Thus, the four qubit DFS encoding for collective decoherence
was concatenated with the five-qubit QECC in Ref. [27] to produce a 20-qubit
encoding that provides protection against both collective and independent errors
on the physical qubits. Concatenation thus provides one way to correct leakage
errors that take the encoded quantum information out of the DFS.
    Another approach is to implement a leakage-correction circuit [99]. An ex-
ample of this for the three-qubit encoding into a subsystem protected against
collective decoherence is given in Ref. [89]. Such circuits may be readily incor-
porated into schemes for implementing fault-tolerant computation such as in
Refs. [36, 85]. This particular leakage-correction circuit allows correction with-
out any measurement, providing a simpler approach than usual in protocols for
fault tolerance.
32     Lidar & Whaley

    The third approach to dealing with errors not specifically protected against
by the DFS encoding, namely by Hamiltonian engineering to eliminate addi-
tional errors, is very different from the first two. The idea here is to supplement
the qubit Hamiltonian by additional interactions that impose an energy spec-
trum on the DFS states. The additional Hamiltonian terms are specifically engi-
neered to result in an energy spectrum that eliminates or thermally suppresses
additional errors. This approach has been demonstrated in Ref. [42], using the
four-qubit DFS encoding against collective decoherence. Addition of a specifi-
cally designed set of exchange interactions between the physical qubits causes
the qubit tensor product states in the DFS representation (Section 6.2) to split
into a spectrum of higher angular momentum states that are separated from the
degenerate ground state that provides the zero angular momentum DFS encod-
ing. The effect of this additional Hamiltonian is to transform all independent
single-qubit errors into non-energy conserving errors that cause excitation out
of the ground state encoding. Thus all local phase errors on the encoded qubit
states have been removed, while maintaining their protection against collective
decoherence, leading to their designation as “coherence-preserving” or “super-
coherent”. The energy-nonconserving errors can be suppressed by going to low
temperatures, or alternatively, used as an error-detecting code.
    The fourth approach to dealing with additional errors combines DFS encod-
ing with the method of strong and fast dynamical decoupling pulses proposed
by Viola and Lloyd in Ref. [48]. The first concrete example of this approach was
given by Wu and Lidar in Ref. [61], where it was shown that dynamical decou-
pling pulses can create the conditions for both the multiple-qubit and collec-
tive decoherence error models, starting from arbitrary system-bath interactions.
In the latter error model, this can be done by rapidly pulsing the Heisenberg
exchange interaction, so the scheme is fully compatible with universal quan-
tum computation on the resulting DFS. However, even after the creation of
the appropriate symmetry, leakage from the DFS is still possible. To this end
Refs. [49, 62, 97] showed explicitly how leakage errors too can be eliminated using
dynamical decoupling, and in the case of collective decoherence, these can again
be generated using Heisenberg interactions. Integration of all these components
(DFS protection, generation of symmetric system-bath interaction, and leakage
elimination), has been discussed in Ref. [50].
    These studies of effects of errors beyond the specific error models defining
the DFS and its protection show that there are a number of viable approaches
to incorporate DFS encodings into stronger schemes that provide protection of
quantum states at multiple levels. They can be used both to further improve the
performance of DFS encoded qubits for quantum memory applications, and also
in implementations of quantum computation with DFS encodings [36]. Concate-
nation and leakage-detection circuits provide a direct route to the established
framework of fault-tolerance. Similarly, the use of Hamiltonian engineering as
a design tool to suppress or remove additional errors relates to the very dif-
ferent approach advocated by topological quantum computing, where one seeks
to optimize the Hamiltonian structure to eliminate or automatically correct er-

rors [2, 100]. The DFS-dynamical decoupling combination ties in naturally with
several solid state and atomic physics proposals for quantum computing. These
relations deserve further exploration in the future.


9   Conclusions

This review is an introduction to the now well-developed theory of decoherence-
free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs). The central idea behind DFSs is that
decoherence can be avoided by encoding quantum information into special sub-
spaces that are protected from the interaction with the environment by virtue of
a dynamical symmetry. This idea has roots that can be traced to work in quan-
tum optics, the measurement problem, and the general theory of open quantum
systems. However, the appreciation of its importance to quantum information
theory, the development of a rigorous underlying mathematical framework, and
experimental verification, are all very recent. We have provided here a survey
of these developments, emphasizing the theoretical contributions to the problem
of preservation of quantum information, as opposed to the rich and fascinating
subject of its manipulation. This was illustrated with examples from quantum
optics and general models of interacting quantum systems. It is important to
emphasize that DFSs are only one of several ideas for the preservation of quan-
tum information, and that full protection of quantum information is likely to
involve a combination at different levels of several methods. The most notable
alternatives are quantum error correcting codes, geometric and topological en-
codings of quantum information, and dynamical suppression of decoherence via
the application of fast and strong pulses. It is now increasingly apparent that
there are strong unifying features to all of these ideas, in the sense that there is
an underlying algebraic structure from which all the different methods seem to
emerge. Future investigations will no doubt further clarify this unity, and it is
our hope that new experiments will confirm the usefulness of the DFS concept,
in particular for quantum information processing.

 7. The mathematical and physical relations between these two contributions to
    non-unitary evolution of the system have been the subject of many studies in
    quantum relaxation theory over the last 20 years. In the energy eigenbasis de-
    phasing causes decay of off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, while dissi-
    pation causes decay of both diagonal and off-diagonal elements. In the context
    of quantum computation and error correction it has become customary to refer
    to both types of processes generically as ‘decoherence’. While the original mean-
    ing of decoherence was specifically designated to describe loss of coherences in
    the off-diagonal elements of the density operator in the energy eigenbasis, there
    are several reasons why one may wish to be less specific for general study of the
    effects of environmental interactions on quantum information processing. First,
    there is the undesirable fact that such decay of coherences in the off-diagonal
    elements of the density operator is basis set dependent. Second, at the physical
    level, both dissipative and dephasing interactions contribute to this loss of coher-
    ence in off-diagonal elements. These two factors render it more preferable in the
    context of a general consideration of quantum errors to adopt the now common
    usage of ‘decoherence’ to refer quite generally to loss of unitary evolution and to
    all underlying physical mechanisms for this.
