                                             1. Introduction

                                             A famous question of M. Kac, “can one hear the shape of a drum?”, is concerned
                                             with isospectrality of the planar domains [1]. The bounded domains D1 and D2 are
                                             called isospectral if two domains have the same eigenvalue spectrum up to the degree
                                             of multiplicities, i.e., spec(D1 ) = spec(D2 ), where
                                                             spec(D) = {µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · | ∆fi = µi fi in D, fi = 0 on ∂D (i = 1, 2, · · ·)}.(1)
                                             Kac’s question is alternatively stated as “are the planar domains D1 and D2 congruent
                                             if spec(D1 ) = spec(D2 )?”.
                                                  Iso-length spectrality of the domains is analogously introduced for the length
                                             spectrum of closed billiard trajectories on the corresponding domains D1 and D2 .
                                             Also for iso-length spectrality one can pose the same question as Kac’s. The problem
                                             we discuss here is equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality on the
                                             planar domains of a certain class.
                                                  If either the eigenvalue spectrum or the length spectrum determines the shape of
                                             the domain uniquely, the equivalence problem becomes obvious since a congruent pair
                                             of domains trivially provides both isospectrum and iso-length spectrum. However, it
                                             is known that there exists a non-trivial case where equivalence between isospectrality
                                             and iso-length spectrality is concluded. Such a situation was reported by Milnor for
                                             the first time [2]. It is known that there exist the self-dual lattices L1 and L2 in
                                             R16 which are not congruent in the sense that no rotation of R16 carries L1 to L2 ,
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                            2

nevertheless they own the same length spectrum. That is, the quotients of R16 by these
lattices, R16 /L1 and R16 /L2 are non-isometric but iso-length spectral. Furthermore
its isospectrality can also be derived from the exact trace formula which represents
duality relation between the spectrum of Laplacian acting on the flat torus and the
corresponding length spectrum of closed geodesics. The flat torus which is defined as
a quotient Rn /Γ of Rn by a lattice Γ of rank n, the set of eigenvalues of Helmholtz
equation ∆f = µf is explicitly given as,
                 {4π 2 kσk2 | σ ∈ Γ∗ }.                                                (2)
       ∗                                          ∗         n
Here Γ denotes the dual lattice of Γ, i.e., Γ = {σ ∈ R | σ · γ ∈ Z ∀γ ∈ Γ}. The
corresponding length spectrum which is the set of closed geodesics on the same torus
is expressed just by the distance between the origin and each lattice point on Γ:
                 {kγk | γ ∈ Γ}.                                                        (3)
The two spectra are connected via Poisson’s summation formula or Jacobi identity:
                X                                             X
                     exp(−4π 2 kσk2 t) = (4πt)−n/2 vol(Rn /Γ)   exp(−kγk2 /4t). (4)
                  σ∈Γ∗                                           γ∈Γ

This trace formula immediately leads us to equivalence between the isospectrality and
iso-length spectrality, that is, two flat tori are isospectral if and only if they have the
same length spectrum. Milnor’s work is not a direct answer to the original version
of Kac’s question because it is not concerned with the planar domains. But from
Milnor’s example one learned that there really exist non-congruent domains with a
common length and eigenvalue spectrum.
     In more general cases where two Riemannian manifolds have a common finite
Riemannian covering, a sufficient condition for isospectrality was given by Sunada [3].
Let G be a finite group which acts freely on a certain compact Riemannian manifold
M by isometries. Sunada’s theorem tells us that the quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are
isospectral if there exist two subgroups H1 and H2 of G, which satisfy so-called almost
conjugate condition:
                 ♯
                     ([g] ∩ H1 ) =♯ ([g] ∩ H2 )                                        (5)
for any conjugacy class [g] in G. The proof is based on a sort of trace formula which
can be regarded as a prototype of the Selberg trace formula [3, 4]. If subgroups H1
and H2 are conjugate in the usual sense, then these quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are
merely isometric. However it had been known that there exist triplets (G, H1 , H2 )
so that H1 and H2 are almost conjugate but not conjugate in G. Such triplets were
used to construct some isospectral but non-isometric pairs of Riemannian surfaces by
Buser [5] and Brooks and Tse [6]. Sunada also proved that M/H1 and M/H2 have
the same length spectrum of closed geodesics [3]. Therefore, in this case, iso-length
spectrality is derived together with isospectrality from the same source.
     In case of planar domains, after a quarter of century, Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert
[7] solved Kac’s original question also negatively by constructing an isospectral but
non-congruent pair of planar domains (see Fig. 1). For the construction, they used
a version of Sunada’s theorem, which was extended to the orbiford (billiard) setting
by Bérard [8]. Since the source of isospectrality was Sunada’s theorem, iso-length
spectrality naturally follows as well.
     However, if there exists an isospectral pair of planar domains which are not
given by Sunada’s construction, equivalence of isospectrality and iso-length spectrality
cannot straightforwardly be discussed. In fact, no one can exclude such a situation
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                                3

because the Sunada’s condition gives merely a sufficient condition for the isospectrality
and also iso-length spectrality. Nevertheless, as we will show below, it is possible to
relate them through the notion of so-called transplantation of eigenfunctions. The
transplantation method is originally invented by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler
to reexamine isospectrality of some given domains [9]. They constructed 17 families
of isospectral pairs of domains based on the Sunada’s method, and confirmed these
isospectrality by the transplantation method. As far as planar domains are concerned,
these pairs are, to authors’ knowledge, all isospectral pairs ever known.
     It should be remarked that the transplantation method is not independent of the
Sunada’s theorem. In the above case of quotient manifolds, Brooks gave an alternative
proof of Sunada’s theorem based on the transplantation method, which appears a
necessary condition for the assumption of the theorem [10] . However equivalence
between these two methods has not been proved in case of planar domains.




                  Figure 1. Isospectral pairs of domains constructed by Gordon et al .

     The organization of this paper is as follows. We first explain the transplantation
method in section 2 and give its matrix representation in section 3. In section 4, we
provide a proof showing that isospectrality and iso-length spectrality is equivalent for
a certain class of domains, that is, those domains constructed by successive unfolding
of a fundamental building block. All isospectral pairs ever known belong to this class.
In section 5 we enumerate isospectral pairs of domains and compared them with the
table obtained by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler [9]. It is shown that our labor
of searching isospectral pairs is considerably reduced as a bi-product of our result in
section 4. Section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion of our work.

2. Transplantation method

Let us consider two domains D1 and D2 as Fig. 2. We here describe the
transplantation method by taking an example of the proof of isospectrality based
on it. We follow the exposition given by Buser et al [9].
     Transplantation is a procedure which is cutting an arbitrary function f defined
on D1 into its restrictions on each building block, say f1 , f2 , . . . , f7 , and rebuilding a
new function g on D2 by superposing f1 , f2 , . . . , f7 . Note that such a procedure relied
crucially on the peculiarity of the domains, which are composed of several pieces
obtained by successive reflection of a certain common building block.
     By the transplantation shown in Fig. 2, any eigenfunction f with any eigenvalue
µ on D1 is transplanted onto D2 so that the transform g is also an eigenfunction
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                                                                          4

with the same eigenvalue µ. This can actually be confirmed by checking the following
conditions:
  • ∆g = µg in the interior of each piece.
    This is always true because g is given as a sum of several fi ’s on each piece.
  • The function g is smoothly connected on all reflecting segments
    This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the reflecting segment r in Fig.
    2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 fits smoothly with +f2 + f6 − f7 because f3 and
    f6 , or −f5 and −f7 was smoothly connected on the original domain D1 and −f2
    and f2 also fits smoothly on the segment by the reflection principle. We can also
    check the smoothness condition on the other reflecting segments in the same way.
  • The function g vanishes on the boundary of D2 .
    This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the boundary segment b in Fig.
    2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 vanishes because −f2 cancels f3 there and f5 was
    already zero. We can also check the boundary condition on the other boundary
    segments in the same way.
One more condition is invertibility of transplantation, which guarantees that the
dimensions of the space belonging to the eigenvalue µ, i.e., the multiplicity of µ,
on D1 is equal to the dimension on D2 or less. This is expressed as the condition,
  • The transplantation is invertible as a linear map.
    This is not trivial, but can be easily checked to be true for this example.
Thus these four conditions lead to Spec(D1 ) ⊂ Spec(D2 ). The last condition
becomes the check to see that any eigenfunction with any eigenvalue ν on D2 can
be transplanted onto D1 conversely, that is, spec(D2 ) ⊂ spec(D1 ). In this way, we
know that these two domains are isospectral.

     These are conditions for eigenfunctions satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions,
but they are also Neumann isospectral. This can be verified by changing all the
minus signs before each element of transplanted function fi to the plus one when one
superposes them on the transformed domain. Conversely it is possible to construct
Dirichlet isospectral pairs once Neumann isospectral are at hand. The procedure is
as follows: (i) for both domains, attach the code σi = 1 or -1 to each building block
i such that the codes of neighboring blocks are different, (ii) let the building block i
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                           5

with code σi be transformed onto the building block i′ with code σi′ , and if σi σi′ = 1
then the sign before fi is set to be plus and otherwise minus. It is easy to show that
the resulting pair of domains are Dirichlet isospectral. Therefore, isospectrality with
respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is equivalent.
     We also remark that the above proof is independent of the choice of a building
block. This means that this example represents not only a single pair of isospectral
domains but also a family of isospectral pairs, which are realized by replacing a
building triangle simultaneously with another shaped building block. In particular,
we can obtain the example of Gordon et al . in Fig. 1 by replacing the building block
in Fig. 2 by a heptagon.

3. Transplantability and its matrix representation

In this section, we provide an alternative and more transparent condition for the
transplantability of eigenfunctions. In what follows, we limit ourselves to the class of
domains constructed by successive reflection of a fundamental building block, which
we call unfolded domains, since transplantation of eigenfunctions is most simply done
between such domains. In order to make successive unfolding possible, each building
block is supposed to have three line segments at which the building block is reflected.
The domains shown in Figs 1 and 2 are the examples. Hereafter we denote N as the
number of building blocks composing the unfolded domain.
     The whole shape of the unfolded domain is determined by the choice of the
building block and the rule specifying unfolding. The unfolding rule can be identified
with the edge-colored graph and the correspondence is given in table 1. Each
piece obtained by reflection is represented by the vertex of the graph, and the
reflecting segment by its edge. The three boundary segments of the building block
are distinguished by the color of the edges. Some boundary segments of the building
block form the boundary of the whole unfolded domain, and we represent the edge
corresponding to one of such boundary segments as the closed loop. An example of
edge-colored graph is demonstrated in Fig. 3.

                 Table 1.
                     unfolding rule           edge-colored graph

                  reflecting segments   ←→           edges
                    kind of segment     ←→       color of edge


     The structure of a graph is also represented by the adjacency matrix. That is, the
reflecting rule to generate an unfolded domain P is given by the triplet of adjacency
matrices MaP , MbP , and McP defined as follows:
                            (
                     P        1         if the piece i is adjacent to j by segment γ
                  (Mγ )ij =                                                          . (6)
                              0         otherwise
                                        γ = a, b, c.
Diagonal element (MγP )ii is set to be 1 if the piece i has the boundary segment γ. The
adjacency matrix is, in general, not uniquely determined even if one fixed the graph
because there remains a freedom to determine the order of labeling vertices. In this

                 U MaP U −1 = MaQ ,          U MbP U −1 = MbQ ,      U McP U −1 = McQ .    (7)
Here the permutation matrix is defined as a N ×N matrix in which each row or column
has only one unity, and all the other elements are zero. If the building block has some
symmetry, for example reflecting symmetry with respect to a certain axis, it might
happen that non-permutation matrix connects the congruent pair P and Q. However,
if one destructs the symmetry by changing the shape of the building block, such an
“accidental” situation can be avoided. The condition (7) for a permutation matrix U ,
therefore, becomes the necessary and sufficient condition for the congruency of P and
Q in this sense.
     Next we give the condition for transplantability of eigenfunction of two given
unfolded domains using the adjacency matrices. By transplantability we mean the
possibility that isospectrality of a pair of unfolded domains can be verified by the
transplantation method.
     The transplantation procedure described in section 3 is explicitly expressed as
follows. Let P and Q be two unfolded domains composed of N copies of a common
building block. Let T : L2 (P ) ∋ f 7→ g ∈ L2 (Q) be a linear transformation. We
say that the transformation T is a transplantation if the transform g is obtained by
cutting and pasting f , namely,
                        N
                        X
                 gi =         Tij fj ,   i = 1, 2, . . . , N,                              (8)
                        j=1

where fj and gi denote restrictions of f and g = T f to each piece, respectively. Also
as mentioned in section 2, it is not trivial at all that the transform g becomes an
eigenfunction on the transformed domain at this stage.
     For given unfolded domains P and Q, we say that they are transplantable if there
exists an invertible transplantation T satisfying the following conditions:
                   T MaP T −1 = MaQ ,           T MbP T −1 = MbQ ,    T McP T −1 = McQ .   (9)
It can be easily checked that smoothness on all the reflecting segments and the
boundary conditions on the unfolded domains are satisfied if the above conditions
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                                  7

are fulfilled. Here, existence of the inverse matrix T −1 corresponds to the invertible
condition. The condition (9) is the one for transplantability of Neumann boundary
condition, but as remarked in section 2, it is equivalent to transplantability of the
Dirichlet case. As was seen in the previous section, P and Q are isospectral if they
are transplantable.
     Note that if T is a permutation matrix, then P and Q are merely congruent.
Therefore, in order to construct isospectral but non-congruent pair of unfolded
domains, we must find a matrix satisfying the condition (9), but not a permutation
matrix.

4. Transplantability and iso-length spectrality

We next consider the length spectrum of the unfolded domain. The length spectrum
is the set of length of closed trajectories or periodic orbits on the billiard domain. We
first consider the relation between closed trajectories on the unfolded domain P and
its fundamental building block B. Note that any periodic orbit on P can be regarded
as the lift of a closed trajectory on B, because its projection is always a periodic orbit
on B. However, the converse is not necessarily true. A single closed orbit on B yields
N trajectories as its lift on the unfolded domain P , which are sometimes closed orbits
on P but the others not. By the construction of the adjacency matrix MγP , it is easy
to see that the number of closed lifts of a given closed trajectory on B is counted as
                  nP (γ) = Tr(MγPm MγPm−1 · · · MγP1 ),                                     (10)
where γ = γ1 γ2 · · · γm (γi = a, b, c) denotes the sequence representing in which order
a given closed trajectory on B hits the boundary segments (for example, see Fig.
4). Such a sequence is not determined uniquely for a given closed orbit. In fact, if
γ = γ1 γ2 · · · γm is a sequence specifying some closed trajectory, then all sequences
obtained by its cyclic shift such as γ2 · · · γm γ1 , γ3 · · · γm γ1 γ2 , etc. can be regarded as
the sequence giving to the same closed trajectory. However the number of closed lifts
is invariant because of the relation:
                   Tr(MγPm · · · MγP2 MγP1 ) = Tr(MγP1 MγPm · · · MγP2 MγP1 (MγP1 )−1 )
                                           = Tr(MγP1 MγPm · · · MγP2 )                      (11)
                                           = ···.
Thus the length spectrum of closed trajectories for P is determined by the length
spectrum for B and nP (γ).
     In order that two unfolded domains P and Q constructed by the same-shaped
building block B have the same length spectrum, it is sufficient that the numbers of
closed lifts should coincide for all possible sequences of γ. It can easily be checked that
nP (γ) and nQ (γ) are invariant if P and Q are transplantable, i.e., the condition (9)
is satisfied for the adjacent matrices of P and Q. Therefore we obtain the following
claim.

Proposition 1 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive
reflections of the same building block . If P and Q are transplantable, then nP (γ) =
nQ (γ) for any sequence γ, which leads to iso-length spectrality of P and Q.

     The inverse of the above proposition is to inquire whether or not nP (γ) = nQ (γ)
gives the sufficient condition for transplantability. The following statement gives its
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                                     8




                                                                            a       c

                                                                                b

answer: the condition nP (γ) = nQ (γ) is precisely the analog of the transplantability
of eigenfunctions.

Proposition 2 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive
reflection of the same building block. If nP (γ) = nQ (γ) for any sequence γ, then P
and Q are transplantable, which leads to isospectrality of P and Q.

Proof We have shown that transplantability implies isospectrality in section 3. Here
we will show that transplantability follows from nP (γ) = nQ (γ). Let GP and GQ be
the groups generated by adjacency matrices:
                 GP = hMaP , MbP , McP i,      GQ = hMaQ , MbQ , McQ i.                        (12)
Since adjacency matrices themselves are also permutation matrices introduced in
section 4, GP and GQ are subgroups of the symmetric group SN , so they are finite.
Let F3 be a free group generated by characters a, b, and c. We can define surjective
homomorphism:
                 ΦP : F3 ∋ γ1 γ2 . . . γm 7−→ MγPm MγPm−1 · · · MγP1 ∈ GP ,                    (13)
then GP is isomorphic to F3 / ker ΦP . GQ is also isomorphic to F3 / ker ΦQ .
    We now assume that nP (γ) = nQ (γ) for any sequence γ, and note that MγP =
E ⇔ nP (γ) = N , where E denotes N × N identity matrix. Then we have
                 ker ΦP = {γ | MγP = E}
                         = {γ | nP (γ) = N }
                         = {γ | nQ (γ) = N }                                                   (14)
                         = {γ | MγQ = E}.
                                Q
                         = ker Φ
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                          9

Here MγP and MγQ denote MγPm MγPm−1 · · · MγP1 and MγQm MγQm−1 · · · MγQ1 , respectively.
This means that GP is isomorphic to GQ . We can suppose identity maps:
                 ρP : GP → GL(N, C),       ρQ : GQ → GL(N, C)                       (15)
                                  P         Q                        P
to be linear representations of G     and G , respectively. Since G      is isomorphic to
GQ ,
                 ρ : GP ∋ MγP 7→ MγQ ∈ GL(N, C)                                     (16)
is another linear representation of GP . Note that nP (γ) and nQ (γ) become the
characters of representations ρP and ρ respectively, and they are equal by our
assumption. Character theory tells that two representations with the same character
are similar[11]. This means that there exists an invertible matrix T such that
                 T MγP = MγQ T    for any γ                                         (17)
This leads to transplantability between P and Q.                               (Q.E.D)
     By propositions 1 and 2, we know equivalence between transplantability
and coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts, which are sufficient conditions
for isospectrality and iso-length spectrality respectively. However if we assume
transplantability, which is more strict condition than isospectrality, then iso-length
spectrality follows. Conversely, we assume coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts,
as a sufficient condition for iso-length spectrality, then isospectrality follows. Our
results can be summarized as the following schema.


                 isospectrality ⇐ transplantability
                                ⇔ ∀γ nP (γ) = nQ (γ)
                               ⇒ iso-length spectrality

5. List of transplantable pairs for N ≤ 13

As an application of the above propositions, we enumerate isospectral pairs of unfolded
domains whose isospectrality can be verified by the transplantation method. The
candidate space we have to explore is the set UN which consists of all possible edge-
colored graphs without cycles, each of which represents an unfolding rule. The absence
of cycles guarantees for the unfolded domain to be formed flatly for any shaped building
block.
     The advantage to use the propositions 1 and 2 (and their proof) is that even
for the purpose of listing up transplantable pairs(or triplets if possible), we do not
have to make pairwise comparisons. This is because we can regard each relation
nP (γ) = nQ (γ) as a necessary condition for the transplantability of P and Q, and use
each relation as a “filter” to pick up transplantable candidates. More precise steps to
find out the transplantable pairs is as follows:
  (i) For all edge-colored graphs P in UN , compute the character nP (γ) for all possible
      γ.
 (ii) prepare the spectrum of characters {nP (γ)} by ordering the character nP (γ)
      according to an appropriate rule for γ (lexicographical order of sequence γ, for
      example).
(iii) pick up the pair of edge-colored graphs whose character spectra are the same.
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                             10

According to the proposition 2, if one finds the identical character spectra, i.e.,
{nP (γ)} = {nQ (γ)}, they yield the transplantable pairs. One might be afraid that the
step (i), i.e., enumeration of the character spectrum seems to require infinite number
of steps, reflecting the fact that γ should run over all possible sequences composed of
a, b, c. However, this is not the case, since GP only forms a finite group as mentioned
in the proof of proposition 2.
      It is interesting to note that coincidence of the “ground state”, i.e., nP (γ) = nQ (γ)
for null sequence of γ leads that the number of building blocks forming the unfolded
domains is equal, which can be read that the area of two domains are equal. Also the
condition for the “first exited state”, i.e., nP (γ) = nQ (γ) where γ = a, b or c, gives
the condition for the length of the boundary to coincide. These geometrical quantities
agree with the first and second terms in the Weyl expansion respectively [1, 12, 13].

                   7    143      7 pairs   13   148577    26 pairs


     Applying the above procedure to the edge colored graphs up to N = 13, we have
enumerated all possible transplantable pairs, which are listed in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows
isospectral pairs ever known, which are listed in [9]. Our result completely agrees with
the list of known transplantable pairs presented in Fig. 5 at least up to N = 13. Note
that all 17 examples given in [9] have been generated based on the Sunada’s method.

6. Summary and discussion

We have shown that transplantability of eigenfunctions on unfolded domains is
equivalent to coincidence of the character spectrum {n(γ)}. The former is a sufficient
condition for isospectrality and the latter for iso-length spectrality.
     As mentioned in the introduction, if so-called almost conjugate condition (5) is
satisfied for a pair of subgroups H1 and H2 , one knows that the quotients M/H1 and
M/H2 are isospectral, and iso-length spectrality of M/H1 and M/H2 simultaneously
follows. The first counter example of Kac’s original problem has been constructed
with this Sunada’s condition [7]. Once an isospectral pair is obtained based on such
a group theoretical argument together with the orbifold construction, one can easily
check isospectrality of the resulting pair using the transplantation method. In this way,
at the beginning, transplantation procedure serves only as a check or demonstration
for a given pair of domains to be really isospectral. It is uncertain whether or not there
exist transplantable pairs of domains which are not constructed based on the Sunada’s
condition, while the Sunada’s condition is a sufficient condition for transplantability.
     However, by expressing an explicit condition (5) for transplantability using
adjacency matrices, one notices the similarity between the almost conjugate condition
(5) in Sunada’s theorem and the condition for existence of non permutation matrix T
in (9). Even if there exists an invertible matrix T satisfying (9), it is not necessarily
Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality                            11

true that they give an isospectral pair because they are congruent if T is merely
a permutation matrix. Such a situation reminds us of the case where the almost
conjugate condition (5) is satisfied but the subgroups H1 and H2 are conjugate, which
gives only an isometric pair.
     Therefore it would become a natural question to inquire about the relation
between the Sunada’s construction of isospectral domains and the transplantation
method. Numerical enumeration attempted in section 5 elucidated that at least up to
N = 13 all the transplantable pairs are those pairs derived by Sunada’s method. This
suggests the possibility of its equivalence.
     The condition nP (γ) = nQ (γ) for all possible sequences of γ, which is
equivalent to transplantability of eigenfunctions, provides not only an efficient
algorithm to enumerate transplantable pairs of planar domains, but has an interesting
“geometrical” interpretation: Each nP (γ) plays a role of the coefficient of Weyl
expansion as mentioned in section 5.
     Transplantation method, on which we have relied in this paper, is available only
to the class of unfolded domains. Whether isospectrality is equivalent to iso-length
spectrality in more general domains is still an open problem.
