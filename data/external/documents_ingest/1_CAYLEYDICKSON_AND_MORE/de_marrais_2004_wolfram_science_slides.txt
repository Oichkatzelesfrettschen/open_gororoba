The “Something From Nothing” Insertion Point: Where NKS Research
into Physics Foundations Can Expect the “Most Bang for the Buck”

1: Introducing the “Box-Kite Papers” and Zero-Divisors Generally
The focus of this presentation is the largely unexplored subject of “zero-divisors,”
(henceforth, “ZD's”) which are forms of (hypercomplex) imaginary numbers with the
peculiar property that two such, if chosen properly, are both substantial quantities – yet
they have, as their product, nothing. Like the gnarly “coastline curves” classical analysis
dismissed as “monstrosities” until Mandelbrot tamed them, then generalized “fractals”
from the examples they offered, such algebraic beasts have been deemed “pathological”
ever since a celebrated proof of Hurwitz's showed, a little over a century ago, that such
entities are not just oddballs, but unavoidable.1 (And, a little less than seven years ago,
the Mexican mathematician Guillermo Moreno2 showed more: in the 16-D imaginaries
called “Sedenions” where we're first forced to deal with them, ZD's conform to some
remarkably familiar algebraic patterns which have echoes in all higher, 2N-dimensional,
extensions of imaginaries. This led immediately to my own research, and a series of three
monographs and counting which I call, for visually intuitive reasons I'll get to in short
order, the “box-kite papers,” shorthanded herein as BK1, BK2, and BK3 respectively.3)
What Hurwitz showed in 1896 marked the end, in one key sense, of the revolution
begun in the 1810's by taking those entities Descartes had derisively deemed “imaginary”
seriously. The stupendously deep rethinking of all mathematics they facilitated in the
hands of Gauss, Galois, Fourier, Reimann, et al., led some people to suspect a general
strategy: after many years' frustration, William Rowan Hamilton was able to generalize
the 2-D algebraic geometry of the complex plane to the 4-D context which the science of
mechanics, as he envisioned it, required: in a fit of inspiration, he carved the famous
formula “i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1” with a penknife on the bridge he was crossing. What
made finding this easy equation so difficult is this codicil: ij = -ji, and ditto for jk (and
-kj) and ki (and -ik), which is to say Quaternion multiplication is anti-commutative.
Those familiar with the Feynman lectures will know, though, that this is precisely
what's required for a basis of vectors describing the way real forces work (which the great
Brooklyn physicist was wont to demonstrate by rotating books and other objects in two
different senses, in differing sequence, in class). If losing the commutative law of multiplication is the price you pay, then, for the calculus of dot and cross products (without
which Maxwell's equations, among other things, would hardly be thinkable), why complain? And some contemporaries of Hamilton not only didn't grumble, but they sought to
push the envelope even further, which led Cayley and Dickson and Graves to double
dimension once again, yielding the 8-D Octonions, wherein even the associative law
breaks down. This means, among other things, that their symmetries can't even be codified with group theory, since simple expressions like “abc” become suddenly problematic: for, generally speaking, a·(b·c) and (a·b)·c may well have opposite signs! (Hence,
algebraists concerned with such things speak of “loops” not groups, which do for
nonassociative operations what groups ought to do but can't!4)

Algebraically, the number fields of Imaginaries, Quaternions, and Octonions (usually indicated by C for complex, H for Hamilton, and O) all conform to a “squares rule”:
expressing, say, an arbitrary complex number as z = a + bi, and another as z' = c + di, we
take for granted that the absolute value of their product is equal to the product of their absolute values (i.e., it “has a norm”); alternatively, writing things out in terms of components, we get a relationship between squares (i.e., “the product of one sum of two squares
by another is a sum of two squares as well”): (ac – bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
This generalizes to sums of 4 and 8 squares, for Quaternions and Octonions in that
order, and the formulas, while excruciatingly tedious to calculate in the pre-computer
days when Cayley and company were investigating all this, are conceptually, at least,
rather easy to grasp. People naturally wanted to keep doubling dimensions, to find even
weirder and niftier number fauna, but Hurwitz spoiled their fun by showing that one more
doubling to 16-D induces the loss of something even more critical than associativity: the
very notion of a norm (and hence possibility of a straightforward “squares rule”5) goes out
the window. That is, defining a metric (and hence, standard “field” structure) becomes
problematic; corollarily, you get zero-divisors (i.e., number-theoretic “black holes”).
That last parenthetical remark, though, suggests a context wherein Sedenions, and
even higher 2N-ions, might prove of real use: studying quantum gravity. Of the many
aspects of the latter that make it hard to integrate with standard QM, one in particular
makes the breakdown of norms spring to mind: the index of what we might call an
electron's “self-absorption,” the “fine structure constant” of 1/137, has analogues for the
weak and strong forces, but for gravity the “constant” in fact is a variable! A survey by
three Estonian physicists of Nonassociative Algebras in Physics frames this in terms of
“infobarriers,” or “certain limits in obtaining information” – related to the degree of
“hypercomplexity”required to study their limit-case phenomena (linked in turn to certain
limit-case constants, such as Einstein's c and Planck's h, for C and H respectively):
Complex numbers seem to have a fundamental connection with the special
theory of relativity allowing to introduce the light cone and a
nondetermined interval for events. The noncommutativity of QM is
related to the uncertainty relations and the complementarity principle, and
is characteristically represented by the quaternion units satisfying the same
commutation relations as do the angular momentum operators.6
The authors also discuss Octonionic arguments advanced since the 1970's to
model a third infobarrier, associated with the strong force: quark confinement. And
clearly, Octonionic modeling has been running rampant since the advent of superstrings
and M-Theory, where a stress that sometimes verges on “negative theology” is placed
upon the implications of certain kinds of non-observability.7 But more germane here is a
brief “blue sky” piece by Andrei Sakharov8 concerning an underlying spacetime “lattice”
structure (the lattice constant being the Planck length) subtending gravity, linked to a
spontaneous, post-Big Bang, phase transition – with gravity as some kind of elasticity of
this lattice (and hence of its “metric”). Our Estonian authors see a role here in studying
this fourth infobarrier involving the Sedenions – at which point, their book ends, and my
own thoughts (with progressively emerging links to NKS modeling) begin . . .

The Estonians play with various preparations of Sedenions which serve to mute or
suppress their distinctive zero-divisor features: “binary” and “ternary” Sedenion schemes
which can be almost tamed by matrix methods, etc. This is understandable, as they were
thinking about “infobarriers” at a time when ZD's still seemed “pathological.” But the
history of the hypercomplex should suggest to us that even the loss of structure implicit in
ZD's portends some unsuspected gain in other aspects. Just what might this be? The
answer is quite surprising: contrary to a century's intuition in this area, what I find is a
tendency toward spontaneous cobbling together of ever more elaborate structure as the N
in 2N-ions gets bigger; more, that this “mustering” (and its reverse process, which I think
of – to continue the military analogy – as “demobilizing”) is necessarily interlinked with
the survival of “classical” structures (specifically, associative triplets, clones of the Quaternions' “i, j, k” , which interpenetrate in a manner at once remarkably simple, yet exceedingly rich from a modeler's vantage), in cloistered algebraic “safe-houses” whose
building blocks are the octahedral lattices of ZD's I call “box-kites.”
From here on out, I will have much less to say about physics per se, and much
more about mustering as a general NKS phenomenon. Indeed, the title of this presentation was submitted while I was still framing BK3 – but, much to my surprise, the physics
focus of the results presented therein took shape much more quickly than anticipated,
leading me to feel far less interested in regurgitating results just written up. So I only
note briefly two key themes. First, the algebraic “homomorphism” Moreno found was to
the automorphism group of the Octonions, known in Dynkin-diagram argot as “G2”; but
this is the same 7-fold-symmetric patterning which Dominic Joyce has used to model the
7 “curled up” dimensions of “gauge forces” in M-Theory – and this “Joyce manifold” is
built upon 35 equations. (Also the number of associative triplets in the Sedenions: the
Octonions have 7; the Quaternions, but 1; and 2N-ions in general have (2N-1)(2N-2)/(3!).)
Second, the breakdown of the “squares law” beyond the Octonions opens out on a way of
thinking surprisingly akin to renormalization: if the product of a pair of 2N-ions seems to
need the number of dimensions in which 2N+1-ions live, and if “look-alike” algebras incorporate “sleeper-cell structures” (i.e., dormant ZD's whose ZD-ness is unobservable as
such), with the same multiplication tables as Quaternions and Octonions, but with their
probabilistic nature implicit in (not superimposed upon) their workings . . . if such ideas
are of interest to you, please go to BK3. For I'll have no more to say about them here.
What I do want from physics, to start with, is what one philosopher of science has
called a “remote analogy”9: one which, if not taken too literally, can help guide our
thoughts into the strange terrain we're entering. I refer to the cosmological notion which
has only been taken seriously for about 4 years now, known as “co-evolution.” Since
John Kormandy's presentation at the June, 2000, AAS meeting, it has suddenly become a
mainstream notion to see supermassive black holes as “galactic sculptors” – that is,
necessary ingredients in galactic evolution, at least for elliptic galaxies like ours, with a
clear correlation between the size of the central black hole and the galaxy itself.10 I invite
you to jettison the “common wisdom” of ZD's as “pathological,” and imagine an indefinitely large (in theory, up to infinite-dimensional) space of ZD's – replete with a vast
potential for “mustering” and “demobilizing” structures, be they evanescent or long-term,
guided by a “dark matter halo” of NKS protocols still to be determined – as the “supermassive black holes” which center and structure the galaxies of number.

2: The Theory of Everything: Starter-Kit Concepts
BK3 ends with two pages presenting and generalizing from a “synchronization
table” displaying a fundamental property I call “trip-sync,” for short for synchronization
of associative triplets (a.k.a., systems of mutually interpenetrating Quaternion copies).
Other phenomena (in particular, the “sand mandalas” in the 32-D “Pathions,” whose
graphical sequencing in BK2 – reproduced below – was the first clue to NKS behaviors)
suggested complexity in the NKS sense. But the “spin control” implicit in the “slippage”
between triplets sharing Box-Kite pathways shows us where it's hiding and what it feeds
on. As happens surprisingly often in mathematics, being an inch away from a Big Idea
can feel like a mile until you get there, so while the closing thought in BK3 was that it
was an open question whether the Trip-Sync property holds for ZD patterns in all 2n-ions,
n > 3, it turned out to be embarrassingly easy to prove it in full generality, using nothing
much more than the defining properties of Box-Kite lattices themselves. So Trip-Sync's
deployment will mark the end-point of the presentation here of the “starter-kit concepts”
– after which, the “work in progress” of “mustering theory” proper can be broached.
To get to a point where “trip-sync” will seem a natural thing to contemplate, we
need to consider, first, notation; next, the Cayley-Dixon Process (or CDP), the algorithm
which allows us to build 2N+1-ions from 2N-ions for N arbitrarily large; then, Box-Kites
themselves, which the right notation will make easy to explain, and ensembles of which,
in higher-than-16 dimensions, CDP machinery will let us investigate and navigate with
minimal pain.
While the Quaternions have but two distinct representations, hence two labeling
schemes (ij = k, or ik = j), the Octonions have no fewer than 480, and the Sedenions a
few hundred billion. Nor are all the Octonionic schemes simply “equivalent” in all situations; nor are arbitrary labeling schemes for the Sedenions necessarily useful or even
feasible for our purposes. (For details, see BK1.) Some culling is in order, and a guiding
principle to motivate it. It is found in an outrageously simple-minded convention –
highly suggestive, in formal outline, of the definition of “norm” governing number forms
less “hyper” than Sedenions: for the 2N units in a given universe of 2N-ions, label their
axes with subscripts running from 0 (for the reals) to 2N-1, so that products of two such
units will have indices equal to the XOR of the indices of their factors. This is not only
do-able for all N, but simple to work with to boot.
For the Quaternions, the rule is trivial: instead of i, j, k, write i1 , i2 , i3; and, since
1 xor 2 = 3, the product of any pair of axes yields the third. What's not so trivial is the
sign, though, of the resultant unit. And since, with the Octonions, multiple labeling
schemes conforming to our XOR rule are possible (and actually in use), we choose that
one which results from the most straightforward deployment of CDP. For more than you
probably care to know about this algorithm, see the background discussion and “bit-twiddling” proofs in BK2. For now, I'll just provide a standard, readily generalized, way of
writing Octonion triplets, then expand my interest to embrace the Sedenion multiplication
table; the iterative procedure one can point to in moving from the one to the other will
suggest a very simple set of rules (even dumber than those I reduced things to in BK2) for
any 2N-ion tabulations, which I'll describe in ready-to-implement pseudocode fashion.

As composing strings of subscripted “i”'s is quite tedious, let's just write the
indices in comma-delimited, parenthesized lists of 3, in cyclical order. Put the lowest
index number first, then the index whose product with it yields the positive value of the
third. The Quaternions' “i, j, k” hence gets signified this way: (1, 2, 3). The seven
associative triplets (henceforth, “O-trips”) found in the Octonions are written thus:
(1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)
Note two things: first, each such triplet is clearly “XOR compliant” per my earlier remarks – scanning the list right to left, 3 xor 6 ( = 011 xor 110 = 101) = 5; 3 xor 4
( = 011 xor 100 = 111) = 7; ... Second, this particular mode of XOR compliance displays
2 triplets (bolded in red) where counting and cyclical orders differ: (1, 7, 6) and (3, 6, 5)
yield the wrong signs as we cycle through their products if we write them (1, 6, 7) and (3,
5, 6). Labelings are possible (and actually in use among some physicists) where only one
triplet is written “out of order”; it is not possible, however, to come up with a labeling
where counting order and product signing are in accord in all 7 instances.
The Sedenions include the 7 O-trips, but also contain 28 other associative triplets
(henceforth, “S-trips”) which I now list (again red-bolding those “out of order”):
(1, 8, 9)
(2, 8, 10)
(3, 8, 11)
(4, 8, 12)
(5, 8, 13)
(6, 8, 14)
(7, 8, 15)

(1, 11, 10)
(2, 9, 11)
(3, 10, 9)
(4, 9, 13)
(5, 12, 9)
(6, 15, 9)
(7, 9, 14)

(1, 13, 12)
(2, 14, 12)
(3, 15, 12)
(4, 10, 14)
(5, 10, 15)
(6, 12, 10)
(7, 13, 10)

(1, 14, 15)
(2, 15, 13)
(3, 13, 14)
(4, 11, 15)
(5, 14, 11)
(6, 11, 13)
(7, 12, 11)

For the first column only, all triplets display both counting and signing order, so
that the xor of the smaller pair of indices is identical to their sum. This is directly related
to the workings of CDP: for the key is the middle term in each, namely 8 = 23. The unit
corresponding to this index is the CDP generator: in general, to get 2N+1-ions from their
predecessor 2N-ions, you affix a unit of index 2N and produce 2N-1 triplets as above. All
such generator-containing triplets are, from the vantage of ZD creation, sterile. Indeed, it
is this sterility which leads to the very simple production rule for creating arbitrary zerodivisors: take any arbitrary Octonion of index o (7 choices); then take any Sedenion of
index S, such that S is neither 8 nor the xor of o with 8 (6 choices); the diagonal lines in
the ( o, S ) plane (one of the 7·6 = “42 Assessors”) will have all their points be ZD's.
The tricky part is figuring out which diagonals zero-divide with which. This is
quite different from the situation found in standard QM, where a special (and, from our
purview, degenerate) case of ZD's has a crucial role to play. If we de-reify the usual
operator formalism to reveal the “inner number theory” trying to get out, we can see that
the “projection operators” underwriting spin-up vs. spin-down options, for instance, are
idempotents which just happen to mutually annihilate each other when multiplied (i.e.,
they're ZD's with respect to each other). They define two diagonal lines, with each point
of one zero-dividing each point of the other. Now let's say this again, in simpler English.

We know that a Complex “line” is really a plane; the product of two such lines,
then, is really a 4-space. This space is not navigated by the Quaternions, since it's produced by 2 real axes and 2 imaginaries; but: in one of the great magic acts of modern
mathematics, this “bicomplex” 4-space (as navigated by the “unitary rotation group”
“SU2”) is isomorphic to the Quaternions. The “bicomplex” space is also the simplest
interesting case of the general associative vector space called a Clifford algebra (the one
dubbed “Cl2,” since it has 22 dimensions, to be precise). Its axes include the usual real
and imaginary; but the other two are “mirror numbers” (they square to +1, not – 1), and a
form of i which operates commutatively on the other axes' units. This last is represented
by 2 x 2 matrices with the usual i replacing the 1's in the identity matrix. And since
Wolfgang Pauli's day, the “mirror numbers” (one kind corresponding to each Quaternion
unit) have been represented by the trio of 2 x 2 “Pauli spin matrices.” (All 3 of these, plus
the Quaternions, plus the “commutative imaginaries,” together span the 8-D space called
“Cl3”; we won't be needing to know about this here, though, fortunately!)
If we signify “mirror numbers” by the letter m, then the standard projection operators can be written thus: ½(1 + m). It's easy to show that, for each of these quantities,
raising it to any arbitrary power leaves it unchanged; hence, each operates along its diagonal in the (1, m) plane like the '1' on the real axis – which is to say, it's idempotent. It's
also easy to see that their product (and hence that of any point on the one diagonal times
any on the other) displays nilpotency as well, since (1 + m)(1 – m) = 1 + m – m – 1 = 0.
The diagonals of the 42 planes I've called “Assessors” in the Sedenions are likewise ZD's, but with a difference: they never mutually zero-divide, and they only zerodivide with points on one or the other (but never both) diagonals in some other Assessors.
And we can narrow this down further: they only zero-divide with four other Assessors, in
such a manner that points on the “\” diagonal in one will zero-divide with points on one
of another Assessor's diagonals, while the “/” diagonal will zero-divide with the other.
More specific yet: unlike “projection operators,” which always come in pairs,
Assessor planes containing mutually zero-dividing diagonals come in threes. And, since
each Assessor participates in two such (otherwise unconnected) trios, it turns out that the
simplest layout is actually the one followed: i.e., the ZD activity of each Assessor is constrained within an octahedral arrangement of four “Co-Assessor trios,” where each vertex
represents an Assessor plane, and the trios only share vertices, not edges, with each other.
Note, too, the “edge signs,” indicating which diagonals form ZD's with which,
when two Assessors joined by an edge are considered: if diagonals must have the same
orientation (“ \ · \ ” or “ / · / ”), mark the edge “+”; otherwise, write “– ”. Then color in
the 4 triangles whose edges form “closed cycles” (for vertices A, B, C, each Assessor
pairing “emanates” the third: e.g., ( SA , oA ) · ( SB , oB ) = + ( SC , oC ) – ( SC , oC ) = 0) and
call them “Sails.” Call the other 4 “Vents,” and you get an octahedral “Box-Kite” which
can fly in Sedenion winds. 7 such, all isomorphic, partition the 42 Assessors, each taking
6; from these simple structures, the entire “pathology” of Sedenion ZD's can be grasped.
The monicker “Box-Kite” is further justified by the fact that while the real-world
variety have wooden struts separating opposite vertices, thereby creating support and stability sufficient to let them fly, “struts” provide the crucial ingredient in our ethereal BoxKites as well: the 3 pairs of Assessors joined by “struts” do not mutually zero-divide!

Struts have another major property: products of all 3 “strut pairs” in a Box-Kite
obey the same pattern; the (o, S) multiplications always yield the generator (the index-8
unit in the Sedenions); the (o, o) and (S, S) pairings, though, always result in the “missing
Octonion” (since an Octonion index resides at each vertex, of which there are 6, one must
be absent!) which serves as the signature, or “strut constant,” of the Box-Kite in question.
To differentiate it from an index proper, I write it with a Roman numeral, as shown in the
left-most column in the “Strut Table” above.
The 12 “edge-signs,” drawn above right on the Box-Kite, evenly divide between
“+” and “– ”; but “– ”'s cluster in such a manner as to form the edges of two opposite
faces of the octahedron, one of which is a Vent, the other a Sail. The convention here is
to assume this Sail is ABC (making its corresponding Vent DEF). This special Sail I call
the “Zigzag,” since traversing the edges so that one always “makes zero” creates a 6-cycle
of flipflopped traversals: multiply mutual ZD's from A and B, then B and C, then C and
A, and begin, say, with the “\”; the lines picked will keep switching like this: “\ / \ / \ /”.
Let's make this concrete: consider the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Start with the “/”
diagonal in A's plane (which the table tells us is spanned by i3 and i10 ), and proceed as just
indicated. Here's the actual 6-cycle of ZD products (ignoring constants, since any points
on the indicated lines will serve as well as any others):
(i3 + i10)(i6 – i15) = (i6 – i15)(i5 + i12) = (i5 + i12)(i3 – i10) =
(i3 – i10)(i6 + i15) = (i6 + i15)(i5 – i12) = (i5 – i12)(i3 + i10) = 0.

The other 3 Sails (ADE, FCE and FDB) all have 2 “+”'s and just one “– ” for
edge-signs. Their 6-cycle patterns – “\ \ \ / / /” or “/ / / \ \ \” – suggest the knots they're
named for: Trefoils. This Zigzag/Trefoil difference is the basis of the Trip-Sync property;
all we need do now is consider the O-trips and S-trips which Sails are made of, and “blow
up” each Sail into a kindred “Box-Kite” layout. Only on these, “Sails” now represent the
4 distinct triplets weaving through a Co-Assessor trio, with the sole O-trip cast in the
“Zigzag” role, and the 3 (o, S) pairs which span Assessor planes bounding the “struts.”

“Something From Nothing”

This is much easier to follow by seeing it than hearing it described. So let's take
as for-instance the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Its 3 Assessors' ( o, S ) pairs have the indices
given in the prior page's “Strut Table”: (3, 10); (6,15); and (5, 12). The 3 o's comprise
one of the standard O-trips; but the “recursive Box-Kite” described last paragraph (or
“Rbox” for short) shows that each of these 3 o's forms an S-trip with the other two trio
members' Sedenions. Hence (3, 15, 12); (10, 6, 12); (10, 15, 5) – written in A, B, C order
with the Octonions in bold – are all S-trips we can find in the listings given above.
Two differences should be noted between a Sedenion Box-Kite (“Sbox”) and the
Rboxes one can build on its Sails. First, “double covering”: the Sbox “Sails” are 6cycles, those of an Rbox are 3-cycles. Second, “mutual mirroring”: the orientation of the
cycling (as indicated by the arrows inscribed along the diagram's edges) is reversed when
one moves between Rbox and Sbox representations. This is a side-effect of two things
which are ultimately the same thing: “bit-twiddling” (pure Sedenions must be written
with an extra bit when we XOR them, so that the XOR of two S's is always an o); and,
diagonal skewing (the Sbox places S-terms, which flow with the o-term's cycle in the
Sbox, on the other end of the strut the o and S terms span in the Rbox).
The “mutual mirroring,” then, is an artefact of the Rbox representation. But it
serves to indicate the nature of the property we're after: for orientation-reversal is what
Trip-Sync is all about. Reverting to the Sbox we started with, the o's at each vertex of a
Sail belong to 2 different triplets; in the Zigzag's case, irregardless of the added “weight”
the S-trips carry (an extra bit to the left when we write their indices in binary), the orientation is unchanged as we move from O-trip to S-trip. Hence, we could imagine a sort of
“slippage” as we define Quaternionic orbits deformable into the simple i,j,k cycling round
ABC, wherein the extra bit is “added” or “dropped” without our being cognizant of that
fact. If the two orientations be thought akin to QM-like “spin up” vs. “spin down,” we
could even claim there was an “infobarrier” forbidding us to detect which case obtained.
We cannot say the same, though, in the general case: for, with Trefoils, S-trip to
O-trip “slippage” causes a reversal of orientation, whenever the o shared between them is
not one of the Zigzag's trio (i.e., 2 times out of 3). Consider, for instance, the ADE Sail
in Box-Kite I. Writing the S-trips per above (with O-trip components in bold), we get
this: (3, 13, 14); (10, 4, 14); (10, 13, 7), with each triplet in A, D, E order. A quick look
at the earlier listing indicates that the second and third of these are written in backwards
order, whereas the first (which shares the 3 with ABC) can be “let slip” without our noticing it. This is the ground floor, then, of observability (and, as such, bears a deep relationship to Penrose's “spin networks: a topic for another time). What is more, it holds true
for all Box-Kites, in all 2N-ions. This is the Trip-Sync property. Proving it is easy.
Let's write any S index using uppercase, and any o in lowercase; let's further write
“sg” to designate a binary variable equal to +1. Then any Assessors (K, k) and (L, l), if
joined by an edge-sign marked “–”, will have product (K + sg·k) · (L – sg·l) = (KL – sg·Kl
+ sg·kL – kl) = 0. Since KL and kl = o's, and Kl and kL = S's, then KL = kl = m, and Kl =
kL = M, where (M, m) is the third Assessor in the Sail. If the edge-sign be “+,” then the
opposite obtains: KL = –kl = –m, so S-trip (K, L, m) has opposite sense from O-trip (k,
l, m). Since the edge-signs leading out from a Zigzag vertex in a Trefoil must be “+,” the
edge opposite said vertex in the Trefoil will be marked “–”; hence only the lone S-trip in
this Trefoil which includes a Zigzag o will “let things slide.” (QED – no kidding!)

This may not seem like such a big deal: at least, not within the Sedenions. But as
early as the 32-D Pathions, larger ensembles present themselves – seven Box-Kite septets
I call “Pléiades” emerge, which interconnect 14 Assessors, each of which belongs to 3
Box-Kites and 6 Sails. Sharing these properties but not others is the “middleman” between them and the “Sand Mandalas,” which I call the “Muster Master.” Each of its 7
Box-Kite Zigzags is exclusively mapped to an O-trip – which means, if we treat “spinflips” as units of attractive or repulsive force, the Muster Master can round up (or chase
off) any and all Sedenion Box-Kites by an extension of Trip-Sync slippage.
Given its unique holding capacity (harboring 1 copy each of every O- and S-trip
appearing in any Sedenion Box-Kite), the Muster Master effectively serves, then, as a
Pathion “Atlas” for all ZD patterns on the other side of the 24-ion/25-ion divide. Given,
further, that the word derives from the name of the Titan in Greek myth who kept the
earth and heavens separated by brute strength – and who also fathered the seven sisters
called the “Pléiades” – we could even say “Atlas” is the “Muster Master”'s proper name!
If we assume, as well, that Box-Kites are free-floating, each with its own copy of
(or window on) Zero, and its own clones of appropriate 2N-ion units acting as “internal
coordinates,” wild “population dynamics,” with all sorts of “clumpings” and “schisms” in
evidence, suggest themselves. Further, given the simplicity of the latticework connecting
Assessors and their composites, and the binary nature of the “spin control” we can put in
play among them, the simplest approach to their study seems to mandate NKS setups.
The final pages will provide broad and sharp-edged guidelines for pursuing them.
The remainder of this presentation will be focused on three tasks. First, if we
must (rather literally) “redouble” our efforts by moving from Sedenions to higher reaches
(to the 32-D Pathions at least, where “Sand Mandalas,” “Pléiades,” and the “Muster Master” live), we'll need to redeem an earlier promissory note, and provide some “pseudocode”-level detail concerning general 2N-ion multiplication. Next, we'll probe the phenomena just alluded to in 32-D, wherein NKS patterns respectively were first suspected, and
NKS tactics seem most clearly motivated. Then we'll hone in on a surprisingly deep connection between ZD's and Boolean logic, which I'm only beginning to grasp myself –
which will lead me to rough-sketch a promising possibility for fusion of methods.
At April's conference, my own poster was situated a few feet away from Rodrigo
Obando's in the presentation gallery, and what I gathered of his work from discussions
there and later surprised and excited me. Certain “magic numbers” were common to both
our approaches, for reasons neither of us clearly understands yet. The order of the second
“simple group,” 168, plays a critical role in his Boolean-function approach toward generating (r = 2) NKS complexity from logical “first principles” (it's the number of both isoand anti- tone functions with 4 variables, a result which goes all the way back to Dedekind). In my own eliciting of ZD “head counts,” 42 Assessors implies168 oriented lines
of ZD's, as well as the same number of “edge currents” (2 per edge, 12 edges per BoxKite), both echoing the order of PSL(2,7), the finite projective triangle which houses
Octonion labeling schemes – and pops up again when investigating fixed “strut-constant”
slices of the Pathion pie . . . about which, I can't say anything further until I've deployed
the arguments just promised. But I can say that such surprising “hybrid fusion,” between
such disparate points of view, is what conferences like NKS 2004 are meant to facilitate.
What better theme, then, could present itself for bringing these pages to a close?

3: Revisiting the CDP Algorithm; Invading the 32-D of the Pathions
Let's return to the scene of the crime: the triplet listings on page 5. Recall that the
first of the 4 columns of S-trips has all its length-3 lists in counting and signing order (because the '8' in the middle is the generator). What to make of the apparently random way
disordered lists display in the columns to the right? Reading from the left, there are 4, 5,
and 3 in successive columns: half the 28 “8-less” O- and S- trips. Where is the pattern in
this? The answer is found in the relation of the rows (one per o) to the 3 O-trips implicit,
via “slippage,” in the o-harboring S-trips listed across each row's “8-less” columns.
If you left-multiply i8 by any io, you get + i(8+o) – which is an S. Likewise, multiplying i8 on the left by any S will yield a negative o – of index (S – 8). Apply this obvious
logic to the triplets on the left, operating on those in the rows whose leading o's form an
O-trip. In the cycle (1, 2, 3), two consecutive terms have xor equal to the third, with positive sign; the rightmost terms in the same rows, though, while not forming a cycle as
written, imply one upon xoring and sign-flipping. Paralleling 2 xor 3 = 1, we have 10 xor
11 = 1, but with sign reversed. Whence the S-trip at the top of the 1st column, (1, 11, 10).
By cycling according to the same logic, (3 xor 1 = 11 xor 9 = 2) → (2, 9, 11), and (1 xor 2
= 9 xor 10 = 3) → (3, 10, 9). By proceeding similarly with (1, 4, 5), rows 1 of the 2nd
column, and rows 4 and 5 of the 1st, get filled in, while working with (1, 7, 6) completes
the 1st row and 1st column. Conducting the same sort of business with the next two Otrips – (2, 4, 6) and (2, 5, 7) – suffices to finish the tabulation.
This procedure can be extended to 2N-ions, N any integer: just replace 8 with the
appropriate generator, g = 2N-1, and create a first column with g – 1 triplets, one per row.
The number of columns will correspond to the number of L- (no longer just O-) trips,
where L indicates indices lower than g (with U indicating those we'd now signify with
uppercase lettering, the way we used S for Sedenion indices > 8, which indices appear in
U-trips). For the Pathions, this means 7 columns to the right – the number of Octonion
units. For 2N-ions generally, the number of columns to the right of the g-containing one
equals the count of imaginary units in the 2N-2-ions: 0 for H, 1 for O; 3 for S; 7 for P...
This table-building strategy is not only easy to implement, but it's a lot simpler
than the way the CDP algorithm is typically explained – which means, perhaps, it should
be dubbed the “Fast CDP.” And it also suggests a table-free method for calculating the
products of any two imaginaries of arbitrary indices. It can be summarized in 3 rules:
Triple Negatives Rule: For the general product of two units whose indices are r
and c (for row and column, where we read off the left- and right-hand terms to the multiplication in an imagined table of product indices, ranging from 0 to 2N+1 - 1), if both are
less than the generator g = 2N, the value in cell (r, c) of the table = r·c. If one term > g (it
doesn't matter which), the index and sign of their product is just [–(2N + r·c)]. If both
terms > g, XOR-ing kills the 2N, leaving just [–r·c].
Trident Rule: Multiplying g on the left (right) by any unit whose index > g results in a unit whose index is their sum, with same (opposite) sign. Diagonal entries in
quadrants of the table (the result of products where r = c) are + g below the main diagonal
(whose “index 0” entries, all squares of imaginaries, evaluate to –1), and – g above it (but
for the 1st row, which is just the trivial, all-positive, products with the real unit).
Recursive Bottoming: Successive use of these two rules resolves all products.
R. de Marrais

Page 10

“Something From Nothing”

The reader is encouraged to pore over the Sedenion multiplication table, the better
to see how it conforms to these rules, taking g variously as 1, 2 or 3. A version with
checkerboard shading, to make two levels of “quadrants” easier to see, can be reached by
clicking the “BK1” URL in the 3rd endnote and going to page 6. As a way to gain rapid
entry into higher dimensions, however, the reader is invited to consider another rule,
which can generate properly signed triplets in arbitrarily high dimension.
Zero-Stuffing: Insert 0's in the same position in the binary representation of a
triplet, and you'll get another, similarly signed. Taking the H-spanning triplet (1, 2, 3)
and stuffing 0's to the right, then the middle, yields the O-trips (2, 4, 6) and (1, 4, 5). This
plus the sign-flipping effect of adding 1-bits to the left of, then xoring, doublets – (1, 2);
(2, 3); (3, 1) giving (3, 6, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 5, 7) – yields up all the O-trips save (3, 4, 7).
Zero-stuffing can generate an infinite series of “harmonics” of any given triplet;
and, by extension, it can give us a similarly infinite “overtone series” of Box-Kites. This
fact, plus a simple generalization of the “strut constant” notion, makes generating and
classifying Box-Kites in the Pathions fairly straightforward (up to a point, as I'll shortly
spell out). Take the four O-trips of one of the seven Sedenion Box-Kites, and make them
the L-trips for a “base-line” Pathion Box-Kite by stuffing a zero to the right of the leftmost 1-bit in each Assessor's S term: the strut constant remains unchanged, but the S
terms become U terms, with indices increased by 8.
In the Sedenions, though, each strut constant, by dint of being a “missing Octonion,” implicated 3 pairs of strut-opposite Assessors (one per each O-trip containing it).
But 7 S-trips contain the Octonion, and each of these must be accommodated when we set
about constructing Box-Kites in the Pathions. The upshot is that each strut constant now
collects 7 Box-Kites, as there are now 24-2 Assessors to choose from: each of these will
zero-divide all but itself and its strut-opposite, for 168 ZD products – and, as the 4 Sails
of a Box-Kite each mandate 6 such products, we get 168 / 24 = 7 Box-Kites in all.
Consider the 4 Pathion L-trips which are S-trips, associated with strut constant s =
1: (1, 8, 9); (1, 11, 10); (1, 13, 12); (1, 14, 15). We get 8 Assessors out of them by first
throwing away the 1's, then taking one of the remaining terms as given, and adding a 1-bit
to the left of the other: (8, 25) and (9, 24) form a pair of strut-opposites, as do (11, 26)
and (10, 27); (13, 28) and (12, 29); and (14, 31) and (15, 30). We then build Zigzags by
keeping one O-strut, moving it into the A, F slots if not there to start with, and picking
two S-trip Assessors among the four pair just listed which form L-trips at (A, B, C) and
(A, D, E). Zero-stuffing and 1-bit appending make picking and arranging fairly easy.
For instance, keeping with the ongoing example, the L-terms at the vertices for the
base-line Box-Kite with s = 1 are (3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2). Keep 3 and 2 at A and F: appending
8's to the left of the (B, C), then (D, E), terms reverses their order, giving us this new
Box-Kite: (3, 13, 14, 15, 12, 2). Stuffing zeros to the left of the 21 bit, meanwhile, keeps
terms in their places, but changes the L-terms at the vertices to read this way: (3, 10, 9, 8,
11, 3). Rotating the (B, E) and (C, D) L-pairs to (A, F) scrambles the ordering a bit, but
the same basic principle applies: with (6, 5) at (A, F), the “L-bit trick” gives us (after
some rearrange) this list: (6, 11, 13, 12, 10, 7); the second Box-Kite with (6, 5) on the AF strut, though, requires both tricks to isolate an appropriate match with the right S-trip
Assessors: zero-stuffing sends (5, 4) to (9, 8); but applying the “L-bit trick” twice is
required to send (3, 2) to (15, 14), the last available S-trip Assessors.
R. de Marrais

Page 11

“Something From Nothing”

This last example suggests a problem: with the Sedenions, s ranges from 1 to 7 –
this last being one less than the generator, g. For the Pathions, g = 16, so there are 15
values possible for s. But one of these = the Sedenions' g (which we might call the Pathions' “subgenerator,” g-1), and 7 exceed it. If multiple “L-bit trick” applications are needed frequently, might we not risk “carry-bit overflow” as s grows? The answer is yes.
The reference four paragraphs back to a 14 x 14 multiplication table is not quite
exact, since the product of mutual ZD's, strictly speaking, is zero by definition. To be
informative, the table's cells show emanations: per the earlier definition, diagonals of
Assessors which mutually act as ZD's in fact engage in “pair production” of two oppositely signed copies of the third Assessor in their Sail. The L-term index for this third Assessor is what's shown in the “emanation table,” with an underbar if the edge-sign joining its
producing Assessors (whose L-term indices are shown on the row and column headings)
is “–”. Such a table has blank diagonals (since Assessors never make ZD's between their
own diagonals, or with those of their strut-opposite), hence 142 – 2·14 = 168 filled-in
cells. When s = g-1, though, the edge-signs cluster so that all cells in the upper left and
lower right quadrants are “–”, while those in the opposite quadrants are all “+”.
When s > g-1, however, the ZD population suddenly collapses: only 72 cells are
filled in in each, meaning 3, not 7, Box-Kites. Consider the first such case (s = 9):
Base-Line Box-Kite:
“First Harmonic”:
“Second Harmonic”:

A
B
C
D
E
F
(2, 27) (8, 17) (10,19) (3, 26)(1, 24) (11, 18)
(4, 29) (8, 17) (12,21) (5, 28)(1, 24) (13, 20)
(7, 30) (8, 17) (15,22) (6, 31)(1, 24) (14, 23)

It is tempting to assume the 6 Assessors arrayed in the columns D and A, after
minor rearrangement, form another in the “overtone series” of our s = 1 “baseline BoxKite”: but “carrybit overflow” is at work, so that left-appending 1-bits to all U-terms –
converting (3, 10) into (3, 10+16 = 26) and so on, thereby reversing signs on all 3 members (an odd number) of each triplet – suffices, in this case, to kill off all the ZD's we'd
expect to see. Just as surprising, the triplet (1, 8, 9), “sterile” in the Sedenion context,
provides the doublet from which the Assessors that triply repeat at B and E are fabricated.
A mystery, finally, is placed before us when the 7 (s > g-1 ) tables, collectively
dubbed “Sand Mandalas” after the Tibetan meditative drawings they resemble, are viewed in “flip-book” style: while the (o, 8, o+s) repeaters cluster inside the array, all other
emanations are confined to the perimeter, with this square's edges pulling back in unison
from the table's boundaries by one cell with each increment to s (while the “repeaters”
reconfigure), until we're left in the last still-shot with a 2-cell-thick cross whose ends are
joined up by the “repeaters” – which have rearranged themselves into diagonals.
It was this behavior (whose necessity was proven, after the fact of stumbling on it,
explicitly via elaborate bit-twiddling in “BK2” on p. 16) which first suggested something
like cellular automata at work. More peculiar still, if one folds the table over like a handkerchief, along both horizontal and vertical midlines, the L-terms in the “shrinking box”
coalesce to form the O- and S- terms of the 6 Assessors in the Sedenion Box-Kites whose
strut constants = the differences of the table's s and g-1 terms ( i.e., 1 - 7); the “repeaters,”
meanwhile, coalesce to form the “forbidden doublet” of the Sedenion Box-Kite's s and g!

“Muster Master” and “Sand Mandala” Emanation Tables (s = 8 through 15)

The above graphics are reproduced from p. 15 of “BK2,” and should be read from
left to right, top to bottom: the first “emanation table” is for s = 8; the last, for s = 15.
Rows, columns, and cell contents show L-index numbers of the associated Assessors in
hex (since values range from 1 to 15). Rows and columns are further arranged so that
strut-opposites appear in “nested parentheses” format, in otherwise ascending order, as
with the earlier Sedenion strut table. Since diagonals will always be empty of emanations,
they are simply left blank; in all but the first table, the majority of non-diagonal cells are
also unfilled, and these are left empty, but with light gray background. Cells which form
into the 3 Box-Kites' (o, 8, 8+o) “repeaters” are daubed green; the others are painted red.
As one might expect, as the N in 2N-ion increases, “carry-bit overflow” becomes
even more pronounced, with patterns that look progressively more “fractal” than those
shown: at high s, as cells become more numerous, boundaries become crenelated, and
box-kites even break up into pieces. It is unclear what happens for very large N: does the
density of ZD's → 0 as N → ∞? Would that imply (and quite counterintuitively) that
high-s , high-N spaces become “tame,” perhaps with something like a Hilbert space as a
limit; or, do they instead “merely” become unwieldy and chaotic? Abolutely nothing is
know at present – including whether or not these are good questions!
The heading for the graphics indicates that the “Muster Master” is also on display.
Clearly, it's the upper leftmost, s = 8, table: ironically, the same index plagued with ZDsterility when it's the generator becomes the most “omnivoyant” of all configurations
when it is “demoted” to subgenerator status in the next round of CDP expansionism. Precisely because it's excluded, all the Octonions are included among the L-trips – leading to
7 Box-Kites each of whose Zigzag has an O-trip for lower indices . . . meaning “slippage”
between U-trips and O-trips could be effected “ionically” or “covalently” between the
Muster Master and any Sedenion Box-Kite, and in an“unobservable” manner, thanks to
Zigzag involvement. But Sedenion S-trips can be Pathion L-trips, so “bonding” is subtle.
R. de Marrais

Page 13

“Something From Nothing”

We could, in fact, describe the situation, using the argot of object-oriented programming, as perfect “design-hiding”: for while the o's in the ABC positions (and hence,
the Zigzag) of each Sedenion Box-Kite exactly match the Zigzag L-trip of exactly one of
the 7 component Box-Kites of the Muster Master, it is the S's in the former's DEF positions which get promoted to L-trip status in the latter. Hence, Trefoil L-trips “resonate”
with the U-trips of the lower-order Box-Kites – but only with those that share their singleton o with the Zigzag! The Muster Master Box-Kite which shares Zigzag L-trips with a
given Sedenion Box-Kite cannot have its actions observed at all from the latter's purview.
This is not the whole story, though: in Sedenion Box-Kite IV, for instance, the Strip (13, 11, 6) – which we'll write (A, D, e) to obey our casing convention – “resonates”
with (f, d, b) of the Muster Master's Zigzag-match to Sedenion Box-Kite I, and this interaction is a Trip-Sync “observable.” Below is a synthesis of data from the “Synchronization Table By Box-Kite and Sail” on the penultimate page of “BK3,” and the component
Box-Kites of the Muster Master, listed by their Sedenion Zigzag-matches' strut constants
(shorthanded “ZM#” in the table). Note that vertex locations are rotated ( ® ) in 4 of the
7 Muster Master components: this affects labeling (e.g., Trefoils might switch places and
their cyclings shift in phase), but not triplet orientation, and so can be ignored.

Before analyzing the results of the table above, some backgrounding concerning
the Muster Master is in order, the better to make the results we'll be discussing seem all
the sharper. For completeness' sake, here's a listing of the full set of the Muster Master's
14 Assessors, showing both L- and U- indices, with strut-pairs arrayed vertically:
(1, 25)
(9, 17)

( 2, 26)
(10, 18)

( 3, 27)
(11, 19)

( 4, 28)
(12, 20)

( 5, 29)
(13, 21)

( 6, 30)
(14, 22)

( 7, 31)
(15, 23)

The utter simplicity of this deployment belies the complexities implied in the
table. It would greatly aid intuition to have some way to picture the synergy between the
7 component Box-Kites of this highly symmetric “father” to the Pathion “Pléiades,”
whose 7 “nymph” Assessors with o's for L-terms nicely echo the 7 “stars” with L-term S's
who form their strut-partners. The two descriptive pieces of this last sentence each will
lead us to investigate a different graphical depiction. Let's begin, first of all, with a way
to envision 14 Assessors, each in 3 of the 7 “cleanly partitioned” Box-Kites (by which I
mean, no edges are shared between them), appearing thereby in twice 3 = 6 Sails. The
following is lifted from a paper describing “octahedral fractal” models12 – a topic which
has no direct bearing here, although the graphic fits our themes perfectly.
We can scan this as 7 stacks of 3 Box-Kites– 3 trios including the central one, and
4 more joined by the dashed lines. Assume stacking suggestive of a voltaic pile for the
centrally coordinated sets: if the Assessor at the top of the vertical stack, for instance, is
“A,” it would be replaced in its position in the next-lower Box-Kite by its strut-opposite,
“F,” so that the sequence of descending labels for the trio would be this: A, F=F, A=A, F;
similarly for the perpendicular lines of Box-Kites in the central horizontal plane. For the
other 4 trios, assume vertices joined by dotted lines from the central squares are strut-opposites as well. There's a lot of rotating and translating you have to deal with to make a
consistent labeling scheme; putting in indices, too,
putt p would induce a truly noxious degree of cluttering,
so I won't even try. The idea, I hope, will suffice!
While this graphic, then, serves to present
an image of the interconnectedness of Assessors
in the Pléiades scheme, it gives no clear feeling
for Assessor-level detail: a way to picture the
indices without the distraction of 3-D would be
a useful thing. Here, we can adapt the tactic,
mentioned in passing at the end of the last section,
of representing triplets as intersecting lines, via
finite projective groups: a “stereo” version of
of the PSL(2,7) layout of labeling schemes for
the Octonions which was championed by the late
great Canadian geometer Harry Coxeter. The
interrelations among indices for Atlas and his
Pléiades can be cleanly displayed in this manner,
and “loop algebra” subtleties framed naturally, in
their turn, by referencing these diagram-pairings.
R. de Marrais

Page 15

“Something From Nothing”

PSL(2,7) expresses the symmetries of the simplest nontrivial finite projective plane, known by Fano's name. In
projective geometry, lines and circles are equivalent, so
this diagram should be interpreted as comprising 7 lines,
including the apparent “circle” in the middle. The lines
intersect in 7 points, the Octonion units: the cross-overs
with no nodes or labels are illusions of the projection
process. In this elegant rendering (from Ref. 1, p. 46),
Quaternion units are in lower case (the standard “i,j,k”)
and make the central cycle. The (index-4) generator is at
their circle's center, E. The triangle's vertices are just the products of their lower-case
equivalents with E, so that lines through E are oriented from lower to upper case letters.
Similarly, all three edges on the perimeter flow clockwise, while the central “i,j,k” flows
likewise. The symmetry group of this 2-D configuration of 7 lines, each being intersected
by 3 others (or equivalently, thanks to projective duality, 7 points, where each “cycle” is
determined by 3 of them) is just 7 x 3 x 23 (the number of possible signing conventions
per triplet), or 168. But this is precisely the total symmetry of “Box-Kite space” as well,
since we have 7 of them, each with 4 3-cycles or “Sails”(which means they obey the 24element rotational symmetry of their Octahedral container). If you have stereo glasses
available, you can “see” this from Buckland Polster's Fano Plane graphic from The Mathematical Intelligencer 21 (1999) 38-43: here, the 7 “lines” are just the 3 Struts and 4
Sails, with the 7 “points” being the vertices plus the Zero (which we assume is “piped in”
to the centers of each Assessor-plane “screen” by Strut-connected “cable TV”!)

What I have in mind here is another sort of “stereo,” with the 14 Assessors in any
given Pléiade being partitioned across two such layouts. Just as the PSL(2,7) triangle
above can have its letters removed and relabeled by myriad different indexing schemes,
with the arrows also having their orientations switched accordingly, so too with our
“stereo Fano” manner of showing Pléiade symmetries. In the little table at the top of the
next page, I'll just give the index-number equivalents for the letters, and assume you can
figure out the O- trip and S-trip orientations without my help at this point.

For all but “Atlas,” the 7 L-trips in each line of the lefthand listing split up so that
4 of the component Box-Kites are represented by their Zigzags, and 3 (all and only those
containing an “8,” always situated at “D”) by their ADE Trefoils. This is the Pathions'
equivalent of the “Strut Table” provided for Sedenions. The fact that a fully functional
copy of PSL(2,7) can uniquely serve to integrate all a Pléiade's Box-Kites (with its “shadow” on the right providing “stereo vision” by housing, vertex by vertex, the lefthand
terms' strut opposites) gives striking proof of the Pleiades' fundamental synergies as ensembles: they are by no means loose affilations of independent entities, “cat-herded” opportunistically. (Exercise: draw all 7 Kites for each line, properly orienting the edges!)
Now it is time to turn our attention, at last, to the “Trip-Sync Observables Table”
on Page 14. The first thing to stress is that there is an exact, one-to-one correspondence
between Sails on the Sedenion “receiving end” and the Pathion “sending end” of any
transactions between them: tautologically, each ZM# indicates a Zigzag-to-Zigzag
matchup of the “unobservable” kind; but there is also precisely one “unobservable” linkup, from each Muster Master component's Trefoil Sail L-trip, to some specific S-trip in
some Sedenion Zigzag. And there are also precisely two “observable” connections from
Trefoil-based Muster Master L-trips to specific Sedenion Trefoil S-trips. Such extreme
orderliness and specialization of connection indicates we're dealing with a very stable,
well-articulated platform for doing something.
But doing what, exactly? Here is where I see the next line of research, which will,
I hope, be ripe for presenting at NKS 2005. Viewed in full generality, we have this for a
setup: a latticework of connected Assessors, where Sedenion Box-Kites can “channel” a
quartet of independent inputs from the Pathions' “higher plane”; these inputs are effectively binary, and there is one output, also binary. We have also seen, from many angles
now, the critical role of 168-fold symmetry in all these workings. It is at this point that
Rodrigo Obando's ongoing work13 on applying Boolean function theory to NKS systems
shouts for our attention: for there are 168 4-variable monotone functions, and the same
number of complements, which he first indicated at NKS 2003 can provide the key to
determining the classification of NKS behaviors displayed by arbitrary rules. His basic
tactic (and its clear “resonance” with ZD setups) goes like this.

“Something From Nothing”

Split the bit representation of a rule into two “primitives.” One string contains bits
indicative of an initial input combination that has the central cell's value = 0. The other
contains those telling what happens if said cell value = 1. For the (r=2) situation that
clearly obtains with the Trip-Sync linkup of Pathions to Sedenions, the possible rules
equal 2 raised to the (25 = ) 32nd power, which is more than 4 billion rules altogether –
an awful lot to have to wade through if we've no initial notion of which ones are Class 1
(boringly homogenous outcomes), which are Class 2 (evolving into simply separated periodic structures), which yield up chaotic aperiodic patterns (Class 3), and which – the real
“money shot” here – generate truly complex “Class 4” patterns of localized structures.
But Obando's work strongly suggests (with some specific examples to buttress his
claims) that we can, indeed, predict what sort of behavior a rule will display, and even say
which will be Class 4. First, partition a rule into “primitives,” then see if their bit representations are Boolean monotones. Because the “primitives” have half the string each,
this means we're dealing with the much more manageable count of 216 logical expressions, or 65,536 possibilities, that each “half-rule” can display. If the primitives are properly chosen from the two “monotonous” sets of 168 – each created recursively, by bitstring and-ing and or-ing, out of Oneness and Nothing – we'll get Class 4 complexity.
But meanwhile, we have two sets of 168 ZD “primitives,” on opposite sides of the
Sedenion/Pathion “infobarrier”: one, then, from each party to our “channeling.” And
each Box-Kite “edge current,” if encoded as a string of 0's and 1's, can be uniquely specified by precisely 16 bits. Consider it this way (and there are other ways as well): any
“successful” ZD product entails the involvement of 2 Assessors, which for the Sedenion
“target” (and isomorphically for Pathion “broadcaster”) means 4 bits for each S index, 3
for each o, and 2 extra bits “left over.” Suppose we say these latter determine the diagonals – “\ or /?” – as specified at the two ends of the connecting edge. (N.B.: the edge
sign's value itself is not an independent variable, so can't be counted!)
Now we need to tweak this (or is it “kludge things up”?) a bit. The problem is,
stating just this much means we get two distinct strings for each “edge-current,” depending upon which Assessor we write out first. But rather than get worked up about this
double-count of strings, let's make use of this implicit positional information, in this way:
if the first Assessor is “less than” the second (the o index is lower, say, or it has an earlier
birthday: it doesn't matter how, just that it's “less than”), then assume they both employ
the “/ ” diagonal. If the first written down is the greater, however, assume “ \ ”. Next,
use the first of our leftovers for a “switch bit” in this sense: if “0,” do nothing; if “1,”
switch the diagonal used by the second in sequence, not size. Which leaves us with one
last “extra” to interpret: I call this bit the “spigot,” since I envision it as turning the
“edge-current” on or off – something I have trouble imagining not playing a role!
And while the “168” in the ZD universe are most definitely not Boolean monotone functions by any stretch of the imagination – their fundamental workings, after all,
are defined by XORing, which is not an allowable operation in monotone string-building
– there most definitely is very good reason to expect a rich harvest of transformations
between the two mathematical languages. Let me put this another way: even though I
don't carry an AARP card yet, I still can remember when the idea of “Chaotic number
theory” would have seemed too insane to bear contemplating; by the next NKS conference, I hope to make the case that the problem with that notion is, it's just too tame.

1 I. L. Kantor and A. S. Solodovnikov, Hypercomplex Numbers: An Elementary Introduction to Algebras (SpringerVerlag: New York, 1989) provides an elegant introduction (aimed at “smart high school students” as these were
understood in Soviet-era Moscow) to the whole theme of hypercomplex numbers, all building up to the formulation, in
Chapter 17, of Hurwitz's 1896 proof that “Every normed algebra with an identity is isomorphic to one of following four
algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the Cayley numbers.”

(3) 4:1 (1998), 13-28; http://arXiv.org/abs/q-alg/9710013. The key result was his finding that ZD's in the Sedenions
obey a structure homomorphic to the Lie algebra indicated by the Dynkin Diagram “G2”; but homo- is not iso- morphic,
and only a single concrete instance of a pair of ZD's was given . . . which led to my own radically constructivist, almost
“punk-rock”-like simplicity of 3 production rules and one octahedral-lattice-based “box-kite” graphic to summarize the
workings of the entirety of 16-D ZD's. (Moreno notes, too, that “G2” also implies a powerful scaling of results into
higher 2N-D number forms, since “G2” – the automorphism group of the Octonions – is the “derivation algebra” of each
2N+1-ion number system from the 2N-ions which generate it by the “Cayley-Dickson process.”

(2001), 181-187. Prof. Cawagas' “Finitas” software, which he makes freely available, lets one calculate loops and other
nonassociative structures rather easily in higher-dimensional contexts; he in fact found an equivalent manner of expressing my tabulations from BK1 in “loop language,” which he presented in a paper of this year to the National Research
Council of the Philippines, “On the Structure and Zero Divisors of the Sedenion Algebra”; the correspondence which
ensued after he communicated this to me proved delightfully engaging, and was the direct trigger for “BK3.”
5 Trickier “squares rules,” though, abound, as do esoteric algebras concerned with them, such as “Pfister forms”; A. R.
Rajwade, in fact, has devoted a whole book to them: Squares (Cambridge U. P.: Cambridge UK, 1993). Using his
convenient shorthand, the standard rules have form (2n, 2n, 2n) where n < 4; for 16-D, though, two 16-D numbers, comprising 16 squares each, generally have a product representable by 32 squares (16, 16, 32). But stranger results are also
possible: (9, 16, 16) and (10, 10, 16) also work – which may “mean something very significant” as far as Sedenions are
concerned (except, whatever it is, no one's discovered it is yet!).

9 Agnes Arber, The Mind and the Eye (Cambridge U.P.: Cambridge UK, 1964), 41: “Every grade can be traced between
remote analogies, and analogies which are so close that they pass into identities, and – paradoxically enough – it is often
the remote analogies which have the greatest value, while it is the close analogies of which we have to beware. The
misuse of an analogy by pressing it to the point at which it is confused with an identity, is one to which biological
thought is peculiarly liable.” Where Ms. Arber says “biological,” though, we can just as well speak of any heavily
qualitative and/or speculative area of science (viz., cosmology) where metrics are hard to come by.

11 For completeness, I list in the “Strut Table”'s second column a set of indices I call “Goto numbers” in BK1, 4 per BoxKite (and 1 per Sail). These refer to the 7 “deformed” Octonion copies the Sedenions contain, which I variously called
“Moreno counterfeits” and “automorphemes” (the latter being a name only someone overly fond of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism could love). It was these which, by other means, Cawagas showed corresponded to instances of a hitherto unrecognized variety of ZD-harboring “loop.” Each of these 7 loops contains 4 “Co-Assessor trio” 6-cycles, each of which
appears in exactly one Box-Kite as a “Sail.” (Making a “remote analogy,” think of a Box-Kite, then, as a tetrad of
parental chromosomes, with the “Zigzag” as the father's “Y” and the “Trefoils” as the 3 “X's.”)
