               We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix
               simulations on finite lengths of electromagnetic metamaterials, to determine the effective
               permittivity (ε) and permeability (µ). We perform this analysis on structures composed of
               periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators (SRRs) and both wires and SRRs. We find
               the recovered frequency-dependent ε and µ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions
               predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium
               exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of ε is negative, and SRRs produce a
               frequency region in which the real part of µ is negative. In the combination structure, at
               frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ε and µ are simultaneously negative, the real
               part of the index-of-refraction is found also to be unambiguously negative.

H=γE+B/µ [15]. A medium that responds in such a
manner will exhibit chirality, and a rotation of the
polarization. Indeed, in these calculations we do find
some degree of polarization conversion in the data for
the SRRs and the combined SRR/wire medium. This
evidence of chiral behavior suggests the analysis
presented here provides a good, but not exact,
characterization of the metamaterial.              Further
improvements to the technique should allow a full
characterization to be implemented.
