                                             canonical quantum gravity is constructed. The algebra is generated by
                                             based loops in a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions. The
                                             underlying space can be seen as a gauge fixing of the unconstrained
                                             state space of Loop Quantum Gravity. This paper is the second of

1    Introduction
One of the most striking application of Noncommutative Geometry [9] is
Connes’ derivation of the Standard Model of high energy physics [10, 8]. In
this derivation the Lagrangian of the full Standard Model coupled to gravity
emerges from the spectral action principle [7] applied to a specific almost
commutative geometry.

                                      2
    This formulation is, however, essentially classical and does, at a funda-
mental level, not involve quantization. This raises the question how the
quantization procedure of Quantum Field Theory fits into the framework
on Noncommutative Geometry. Since Connes’ formulation of the Standard
Model at its root is tied up to gravitation, a quantization scheme within the
framework of Noncommutative Geometry must be expected to involve, at
some level, quantum gravity.
    In the papers [2] and [3] we started studying the question of formulating
a quantization scheme within Noncommutative Geometry using canonical
quantum gravity. Specifically, we were inspired by techniques applied in
Loop Quantum Gravity. The concrete aim was to construct a spectral triple
of a noncommutative algebra naturally associated to the unconstrained state
space of Loop Quantum Gravity. Due to technical difficulties we only suc-
ceeded in constructing a spectral triple on a space closely related to the state
space of Loop Quantum Gravity.
    This paper is one of two papers presenting a more satisfactory solution
to the problem of constructing a spectral triple on the state space of Loop
Quantum Gravity as well as its physical interpretations. The paper [1] deals
with the physical background and interpretations of the construction, and we
therefore refer the reader to that paper for more thorough discussion. This
paper deals with the concise mathematical construction.

1.1    Content of the paper
The unconstrained state space of Loop Quantum Gravity is the space of
SU(2)-connections in a trivial principal bundle on a three dimensional mani-
fold. Since the construction we do works for arbitrary manifolds and arbitrary
compact Lie-groups, and since we for physical applications might need it for
later use, we will formulate it in this generality.
    We let G be a compact Lie group and assume we have some principal
G-fiber bundle P over a manifold M. The algebra associated to the space A
of connections in P we want to consider is the following:
    Given a representation of G in MN and given a loop L in M define a
matrix valued function on A by

                             L(∇) = Hol(∇, L),

where Hol(∇, L) denotes the holonomy of ∇ along L. Let B be the algebra

                                       3
generated by all loops based in a fixed point in M. This is the type of algebra
we want to consider.
    The algebra B is an algebra of matrix valued functions over A. We will for
technical reasons explained below consider a smaller algebra than B. We will
take a triangulation of M and consider the algebra B△ which is constructed
like B but only includes loops lying in the edges of the triangulations, or
one of its barycentric subdivisions. B△ is also an algebra of matrix valued
functions over A. Since any loop can be approximated by a loop lying in the
edges of the triangulations, or one of its barycentric subdivisions, B△ can
be considered as an approximation to B. The crucial difference is that the
groups of all diffeomorphisms preserving the base point acts on B whereas
only the group differomorphisms preserving the chosen triangulation and its
barycentric subdivisions acts on B△ .
    In order to construct a spectral triple over B△ we need a representation of
B△ . We therefore need to construct L2 (A). A construction of L2 (A) already
exists within Loop Quantum Gravity, due to Ashtekar and Lewandowski. It
turns out that this construction depends on a completion of A and that this
completion depends on a choice of a system S of graphs. In the case of B△
the relevant system of graphs is given by finite subgraphs of the triangulation
and its barycentric subdivision. The system of graphs considered in Loop
Quantum Gravity is that of graphs made up of piecewise real analytic edges
(of course assuming M to be real analytic).
    Seen from a graph Γ with edges {ei }i=1,...,n the space of connections A
looks like Gn via

                   A ∋ ∇ → (Hol(∇, e1 ), . . . , Hol(∇, en )).

We will also denote AΓ := Gn . Of course AΓ tells little about A. However,
by letting the complexity of the graph grow we get a more and more refined
picture of A. This is implemented by noting that an embedding Γ1 ⊂ Γ2
naturally gives a map
                             PΓ1 Γ2 : AΓ2 → AΓ1 ,
and then simply define the completion of A as the projective limit of AΓ , i.e.
                                  S
                                A := lim AΓ ,
                                        Γ∈S
                                        ←−

We will prove that under some condition on S that A is densely embedded
    S
in A , and hence justifies the term completion.

                                       4
    The construction of L2 (A) is straightforward from this completion. Since
AΓ = Gn we define L2 (AΓ ) as square integrable functions on Gn with respect
to the Haar measure. The map PΓ1 Γ2 induces an embedding
                         PΓ1 Γ2 : L2 (AΓ1 ) → L2 (AΓ2 ),
and L2 (A) is defined as an inductive limit
                            L2 (A) := lim L2 (AΓ ).
                                       Γ∈S
                                       −→

    The idea for constructing the Dirac operator is that AΓ = Gn is a classical
geometry and therefore has a canonical Gauß-Bonnet-Dirac operator. In
order to ensure that this defines an operator on the inductive limit we have
to make sure that the operator is compatible with the structure maps of
the projective limit. It is here the technical advantages of the triangulation
compared to piecewise real analytic graphs shows up. The triangulation
narrows down the types of structure maps appearing in the projective limit.
With this we can define a Dirac operator compatible with the structure maps.
It turns out that there is a lot freedom in the construction. Going from one
level in the inductive limit to the next level we add new copies of G which
corresponds to new degrees of freedom. Each of these degrees of freedom can
be scaled. The entire construction therefore comes with a sequence of real
non zero numbers {aj,k }k≤j , where j, k is just a labelling of the degrees of
freedoms convenient for the explicit construction.
    However, the constructed Dirac operator together with the algebra B△
will not fulfil the requirement of a spectral triple. The problem comes from
the infinite dimensionality of the Clifford bundle of the space of connection.
We therefore need to treat the identity operator on the Clifford bundle as
a finite rank operator. The setting of semifinite spectral triples will allow
exactly this. The von Neumann algebra N appearing from this construction
is a tensor product of the bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space
and the weak closure of the CAR-algebra.
    In order to obtain a semifinite spectral triple we still need to perturb the
operator. At each level in the inductive limit we have to add a bounded
perturbation roughly speaking of the form bj Pj , where bj is a real number
and Pj is the projection onto a subspace related to the kernel of a part of
the Dirac operator at the j’th level.
    The main result in the paper is 4.5.1 stating
Theorem There exist sequences {aj,k } and {bj } such that B△ together with

                                       5
the perturbated Dirac operator is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to
the trace on N .

  In the appendix we will demonstrate the case of U(1) and show that for
SU(2) the perturbations are not needed.

2    Spaces of connections
In this section we will consider the space A of connections in a principal fiber
bundle. We will address the problem of topologizing this space together with
the development of a measure theory. It turns out that the constructions,
which we introduce in order to address these problems, depends on a com-
pletion of A with respect to a system of graphs on the manifold. Different
choices of graphs give different completions.
    The material is standard from Loop Quantum Gravity, but we have cho-
sen to write a more or less selfcontained exposition, not assuming prior knowl-
edge of Loop Quantum Gravity, since we want to put emphasize on several
different completions and their mutual interplay. The original techniques
were developed by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in [4]. For a survey of Loop
Quantum Gravity see [5] and for a detailed account see [14].

   Let M be a manifold and P a G-principal bundle over M, where G is a
compact connected Lie-group. We will for simplicity assume that P is the


                                       6
trivial bundle, i.e. P is isomorphic to M × G.

2.1    Graphs
Definition 2.1.1 Let γ be a continuous piecewise smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M
such that if γ(t1 ) = γ(t2 ) then t1 = t2 or t1 , t2 ∈ {0, 1}. We call γ a simple
curve if γ̇(t) is non vanishing for all t ∈ [0, 1]. This requirement includes that
the left and right derivative of γ is non vanishing in the non smooth points.

    We will call γ(0) the starting point and γ(1) the endpoint.
    If γ1 and γ2 are simple curves where the endpoint of γ1 coincides with the
starting point of γ2 , then the composition is defined by

                                                  t ∈ [0, 21 ]
                                    
                                        γ1 (2t)
                    (γ1 ◦ γ2 )(t) =                             .
                                      γ2 (2t − 1) t ∈ [ 12 , 1]

Note that the composition of two simple curves is not always a simple curve.

Definition 2.1.2 Two simple curves γ1 and γ2 are equivalent if there exist
an increasing piecewise smooth bijection

                                φ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]

with
                         γ1 (φ(t)) = γ2 (t),   t ∈ [0, 1],
and with nowhere vanishing derivative. This requirement includes that the
left and right derivatives in the non smooth points are both non vanishing.
    An equivalence class of simple curves is called a simple path.

   Note that the relation defined above is in fact an equivalence relation.
   The notion of a simple path chosen here implies that a simple path has
an orientation. The inverse of a simple path represented by γ is the path
represented by γ −1 , where

                               γ −1 (t) = γ(1 − t),

i.e. just the path with inverse orientation.




                                        7
Definition 2.1.3 A graph Γ is the union of finite many simple paths {ei }
where the only intersection points are start or end points of the simple paths.
    The paths are called the edges of the graph. We denote the set of edges
of Γ by EΓ . The points {ei (0), ej (1)} are called the vertices of Γ. We denote
the set of vertices by VΓ .
    A graph is called connected if ∪i,t ei (t) is connected.

     We will consider paths on the graph. These are simply compositions of
edges and inverses of edges. We will also think of each vertex as a path in
the graph. Furthermore, we would like ei ◦ (ei )−1 to be equal to the path
ei (0). We fix this with the following
Definition 2.1.4 Let Γ be a graph and let P(Γ) be the set of paths in Γ. We
define an equivalence relation ∼ on P(Γ) to be generated by

                  (ei )−1 ◦ ei ∼ ei (1) and ei ◦ (ei )−1 ∼ ei (0).

   The hoop groupoid HG(Γ) of path on Γ is defined by

                              HG(Γ) = P(Γ)/ ∼ .

    This equivalence relation implies that if p1 , p2 , p3 ∈ P(Γ) and p1 ∼ p2
then p3 ◦ p1 ∼ p3 ◦ p2 and p1 ◦ p3 ∼ p2 ◦ p3 whenever the compositions are
defined. The units for HG(Γ) are the vertices of Γ. It is easy to see that
HG(Γ) is a groupoid.

Definition 2.1.5 Let Γ1 , Γ2 be two graphs. We say that Γ1 is a subgraph of
Γ2 , and we write Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 , if the edges of Γ1 are compositions of the edges or
their inverses of Γ2 .

Note that Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 implies that HG(Γ1 ) is a subgruopoid of HG(Γ2 ).
    The relation ⊂ equips the set of graphs with a partial order. We are
interested in subsystems of the set of all graphs.

Definition 2.1.6 A system S of graphs is called directed if there for any
Γ1 , Γ2 ∈ S exists Γ3 ∈ S with Γ1 , Γ2 ⊂ Γ3 .

Definition 2.1.7 A system of graphs S is called dense if there for every
point m ∈ M exists a coordinate chart x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) around m such that
for all open subset U containing m in this coordinate chart there exists a
collection of edges e1 , . . . , en ⊂ U belonging to graphs in S such that:

                                         8
  1. the ei ’s are straight lines with respect to the coordinate chart,

  2. the tangent vectors of the ei ’s are linearly independent.

    The definition of dense might appear awkward. The main purpose of the
definition is to ensure proposition 2.2.4. Furthermore it is easy to check the
definition in the concrete examples we have in mind. Certainly the require-
ment of straight lines can be eased.
    We will now give three examples of dense systems of graphs, which will
be important in the rest of the paper. These systems of graphs differ partic-
ularly in the size of their corresponding symmetry groups.

     Example 1 Let Ss be the system of all graphs. This system is clearly
dense. The system is however not directed since we can have two simple paths
e1 , e2 with infinitely many isolated intersection points. Hence for graphs
Γ1 , Γ2 , where e1 ∈ Γ1 and e2 ∈ Γ2 , there does not exist a graphs Γ3 contain-
ing Γ1 and Γ2 . The system Ss admits a natural action of the diffeomorphism
group Dif f (M). The system Ss is the same as the piecewise immersed sys-
tem defined in [11].

    Example 2 Let M be a real analytic manifold. Let Sa be the system of
graph made up of real analytic simple curves. This system is dense and it
is also directed since piecewise analytic curves have only finitely many iso-
lated intersection points. The system carries a natural action of the group
Dif fa (M) of real analytic diffeomorphism, but no action of the full diffeo-
morphism group Dif f (M). This system was, in a base pointed version, first
considered in [4].

   Example 3 Let T be a triangulation of M. We let Γ0 be the graph
consisting of all the edges in this triangulation. Strictly speaking this is not
a graph if the manifold in not compact, but in this case we can consider
Γ0 as a system of graphs instead. Let Tn be the triangulation obtained by
barycentric subdividing each of the simplices in T n times. The graph Γn is
the graph consisting of the edges of Tn . In this way we get a directed and
dense system S△ = {Γn } of graphs.

   The important feature of S△ which we are going to use in this paper is
the following: The step from Γn to Γn+1 involves:

                                 Figure 1:


  1. new edges are added
  2. the edges of Γn get subdivided into two edges.
    The system S△ only admits an action of the diffeomorphisms Dif f (△)
that maps edges in ∪Tn to edges in ∪Tn . Hence this is a much more restrictive
class of diffeomorphism than in the first two examples. Contrary to the first
two examples, the system S△ is countable.
Definition 2.1.8 Let S be a directed system of graphs. We define the hoop
groupoid HG(S) of S to be the inductive limit

2.2    Completing spaces of connections
Given a graph Γ define the space
                           AΓ = Hom(HG(Γ), G)
where G is the compact connected Lie-group. If Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 we have the em-
bedding of groupoids HG(Γ1 ) → HG(Γ2 ), and we hence get a surjection
                             PΓ1 Γ2 : AΓ2 → AΓ1 .
Therefore, for a system of graphs S we have a projective system
                                   {AΓ }Γ∈S .

                                      10
Definition 2.2.1 Let S be a system of graphs. The space of generalized
                                           S
connections with respect to S, denoted by A , is defined by
                                     S
                                   A = lim AΓ.
                                          Γ∈S

                          S
The projections from A to AΓ will be denoted by PΓ .
For the systems Ss , Sa , S△ we will denote the corresponding spaces of gener-
                           s  a  △
alized connections by A , A , A .
    Note that when S is directed we have the equality
                               S
                              A = Hom(HG(S), G).
      Given an element ∇ in AΓ we can associate to it ΦΓ (∇) ∈ GnΓ where nΓ
is the numbers of edges in Γ. This is done by numbering the edges in Γ as
e1 , . . . , enΓ , and then defining ΦΓ by
                         ΦΓ (∇) = (∇(e1 ), . . . , ∇(enΓ )).
Lemma 2.2.2 The map ΦΓ : AΓ → GnΓ is a bijection.
   Proof. Follows since HG(Γ) is freely generated by the edges.               ⊳

   The bijection ΦΓ gives a topology on AΓ by requiring ΦΓ to be a home-
omorphism. The topology is independent of the chosen numbering. The
projection maps PΓ1 Γ2 : AΓ2 → AΓ1 are continuous. In fact

                      ΦΓ1 ◦ PΓ1 Γ2 ◦ (ΦΓ2 )−1 : GnΓ2 → GnΓ1
is given by composition of one or more of the following operations:
   • Multiplying gi1 and gi2 .
   • Inverting gi .
   • Leaving out some gi in (g1 , . . . , gnΓ2 ) ∈ GnΓ2 .
           S                                                              S
   Since A is a projective limit of {AΓ}Γ∈S , we define the topology on A as
the projective limit topology. This topology is characterized by the following
property:
   Let X be a topological space and assume we have continuous maps φΓ :
X → AΓ for all Γ ∈ S such that PΓ1 Γ2 ◦ φΓ2 = φΓ1 for all Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 . Then
                                             S
there is a unique continuous map φ : X → A with PΓ ◦ φΓ = φ for all Γ ∈ S.

                                         11
2.2.1   Smooth connections
Let A denote the space of smooth connections in the principal bundle P .
There is a natural map

                       χΓ : A → AΓ = Hom(HG(Γ), G)

defined by
                     χΓ (∇)(p) = Hol(p, ∇),      p ∈ HG(Γ),
where Hol(p, ∇) denotes the holonomy of ∇ along p. Clearly PΓ1 Γ2 ◦χΓ2 = χΓ1
when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 , and hence by the property of the projective limit we get a
unique map
                                         S
                              χS : A → A .
                                                                      S
Proposition 2.2.3 When S is directed, χS (A) is dense in A .

   Proof. We first prove that each χΓ is surjective. The composition

                               ΦΓ ◦ χΓ : A → GnΓ

is given by
                 ΦΓ (χΓ (∇)) = (Hol(e1 , ∇), . . . , Hol(enΓ , ∇)).
Let (g1 , . . . , gnΓ ) be given. Since G is connected we can for each i find a
connection ∇i with
                                   Hol(ei , ∇i ) = gi .
It is furthermore easy to see that since the ei ’s only intersect in the endpoints
we can arrange that ∇i = 0 on all the edges in Γ apart from ei . Hence
                          X 
                      ΦΓ χΓ         ∇i    = (g1 , . . . , gnΓ ).

Therefore χΓ is surjective.
   From the directedness of S and the surjectivity of all χΓ the density fol-
lows.                                                                      ⊳

   The system Ss is not directed. It is however possible with more elaborate
                                          Ss
methods to prove that A is dense in A when G is semi-simple, see for
example the discussion in [12].
   We now turn to the question of injectivity of χ.

                                        12
Proposition 2.2.4 When S is dense, χS is injective.
    Proof. Let ∇1 , ∇2 be two different smooth connections. Hence there
is a point m ∈ M where ∇1 (m) 6= ∇2 (m). Let us choose a coordinate
chart x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) around m according to the density of S, where m
corresponds to x = 0. We can then write
                                 X
                          ∇k =      gkj (x)dxj , k ∈ {1, 2},
                                   j

where gij (x) is a smooth function of x with values in the Lie-algebra of G. Let
U be a neighbourhood of 0 such that we can assume that the functions gij (x)
are constant in U with sufficiently good approximation. Let e1 , . . . , en be
the edges in S which are straight lines with respect to the coordinate chart,
which belongs to U and where the tangent vectors t1 , . . . , tn are linearly
independent. We assume that the edges are parametrized by arc lengths.
Since ∇1 (m) 6= ∇2 (m) there is a j such that
                            X                X
                               g1i (0)tji 6=   g2i (0)tji .
                               i                   i

With sufficiently good approximation we have
                                     X
                Hol(ej , ∇k ) = exp(   g1i (0)tji ),      k ∈ {1, 2}.
                                          i

Hence, if we had chosen U small enough, we conclude

                             Hol(ej , ∇1 ) 6= Hol(ej , ∇2 ).

Thus χS (∇1 ) 6= χS (∇2 ).                                                    ⊳

2.2.2   Completing the group of gauge transformations
Let U be a an element in the gauge group G of M × P , i.e. U : M → G is a
smooth function. Given a connection ∇ ∈ A, U induces a gauge transformed
           ˜ Given a path p on M with startpoint x0 and endpoint x1 the
connection ∇.
holonomy along e transforms according to

                     Hol(p, ˜
                            ∇) = U(x0 )Hol(p, ∇)U −1 (x1 ).

This leads to the following

                                              13
Definition 2.2.5 Let Γ be a graphs and U : VΓ → G be a map. Define
U∗ : AΓ → AΓ by

              U∗ (∇)(e) = U(e(0))∇(e)U(e(1))−1 for all e ∈ EΓ .

Since HG(Γ) is freely generated by EΓ , this is well defined.
   We denote by GΓ the group of all maps U : VΓ → G.
   Note that via U∗ we get a left action of GΓ on AΓ.
   Like with spaces of connections there are natural projections

                                PΓ1 Γ2 : GΓ2 → GΓ1 ,

when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 and

         PΓ1 Γ2 (U∗ (∇)) = PΓ1 Γ2 (U)∗ (PΓ1 Γ2 (∇)),                  ∇ ∈ AΓ2 , U ∈ GΓ2 .   (1)

Definition 2.2.6 Let S be a system of graphs. Put
                            S
                          G = {U|U : ∪Γ∈S VΓ → G}.
                            S          S
Define the left action of G on A by

                        U · ∇ = (U|VΓ )∗ (∇),                    ∇ ∈ AΓ .

    Due to (1) this is well defined.
                                                                  S
    A gauge transformation U ∈ G naturally gives an element in G . When
                                             S
S is dense this induces an embedding G → G . Via this embedding we get
                     S
an action of G on A , which extends the action of G on A. We will therefore
      S
call G the completed gauge group, or simply the gauge group.

2.3    Group actions on the completions
If a system S1 is contained in S2 we get a surjective continuous map
                                               S2                S1
                                PS 1 S 2 : A           →A .

In particular we have the commutative diagram
                                                       P S△ Sa
                                 s P Sa Ss /       a         / △
                                A              A             5A
                                           P S△ Ss


                                               14
Of course the map PS△ Sa only exists if the triangulation is real analytic.
    The group of all diffeomorphisms Dif f (M) acts on A. The question is
                                                           S
what kind of groups acts on the different completions A . In general a dif-
                                                               S      S
feomorphism d preserving S induces a homeomorphism d∗ : A → A . Thus
in this way there is an action of Dif f (S), the diffeomorphisms preserving S,
     S
on A . We have the following diagram

                                        A
We see that the size of the completion of A is strongly related to the size of
                                   s   a
the symmetry group. The spaces A , A are non separable and the symmetry
                            △
groups are large, whereas A is separable and the symmetry group Dif f (△)
                                                      △             s       a
is comparatively small. In this way we can think of A as being A (or A )
subjected to a kind of gauge fixing of Dif f (M) (or Dif fa (M)).

2.4    Measure theory and Hilbert spaces
We will here recall the construction of measures and Hilbert space structures
on completions of spaces of connections. The construction first appeared in
[4]. See also [13] for a different approach.
    Because of lemma 2.2.2 we can identify AΓ with GnΓ via ΦΓ . On GnΓ
there is a canonical normalized measure, namely the Haar measure µGnΓ .
Denote by µΓ the image measure of µGnΓ under Φ−1   Γ .

Lemma 2.4.1 Let Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 . The image measure of µΓ2 under PΓ2 Γ1 is µΓ1 .
   Proof. See for example lemma I.2.9 in [14].                              ⊳

   Lemma 2.4.1 ensures that {AΓ , µΓ }γ∈S is a projective system of measure
spaces. Therefore, according to Theorem I.2.10 in [14], there is a unique
               S
measure µ on A such that PΓ (µ) = µΓ for all Γ ∈ S. Also lemma 2.4.1
ensures that
                       PΓ∗2 Γ1 : L2 (AΓ1 ) → L2 (AΓ2 )

                                            15
is an embedding of Hilbert spaces when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 .

Proposition 2.4.2 Let

                             L2 (A) = lim L2 (AΓ),
                                       −→

                                                                             S
the inductive limit of the Hilbert spaces {L2 (AΓ )}Γ∈S . Then L2 (A) = L2 (A ),
where the latter is with respect to the measure µ.

    Proof. This follows directly from the construction. See for example sec-
tion I.2.4 in [14].                                                        ⊳


3     The Dirac operator on the completed space
      of connections
                                                                   △
In this section we will only work with the completed space A . We will
construct a Dirac type operator acting on a Hilbert space H which can natu-
                                                   △
rally be seen as square integrable functions on A with values in an infinite
dimensional vector bundle.
    The idea is to construct a Dirac operator on each AΓ . Since these look like
classical geometries we more or less only have to put a Riemannian metric
on each of these. Next we need to check that the construction made on each
AΓ is consistent with maps between the different graphs.
    In this section we have no restrictions on the manifold M. In particular
we can have infinitely many simplices in T0 .
    To simplify the notation objects indexed by the graph Γk will be indexed
simply by k for the rest of the paper.

3.1    The case of subdividing an edge into two edges
The construction of the Dirac operator, which will be carried out in the fol-
lowing subsections, looks cumbersome, but is really forced upon us by the
requirement of consistency with the maps between different graphs. There-
fore, in order to present the construction without the full notational weight,
we will first demonstrate the case where the triangulation consists of one edge
and where we consider the step going to the first barycentric subdivision. We
thus have A0 = G, A1 = G2 and P0,1 (g1 , g2 ) = g1 g2 .

                                      16
   For Γ0 we choose a left and right invariant metric h·, ·i on G. Let êi be
an orthonormal basis for Tid G and let Êi (g) = Lg êi be the corresponding left
translated vector fields. Define the Dirac operator
                                     X
                            D0 (ξ) =     Êi ∇Êi (ξ),

where ∇ is some SO(dim(G))-valued connection and ξ ∈ L2 (G, Cl(T G)),
where Cl(T G) denotes the Clifford bundle.
   We want to construct D1 acting on L2 (G2 , Cl(G2 )) on the form
                                  X
                         D1 (ξ) =     Kj ∇Kj (ξ),
                                        j


where Kj is an orthonormal frame in T G2 , such that
                           ∗                   ∗
                          P0,1 (D0 (ξ)) = D1 (P0,1 (ξ)).
                                   ∗
   First we have to make sense of P0,1 . Since P0,1 induces maps

              (P0,1 )∗ : T G2 → T G ,            ∗
                                            and P0,1 : T ∗ G → T ∗ G2

between tangent and cotangent spaces it is also natural to let the Dirac op-
erators act on Cl(T ∗ G), resp. Cl(T ∗ G2 ) instead of Cl(T G), resp. Cl(T G2 ).
This is easily done once we have chosen a metric on T ∗ G and resp. T ∗ G2 . In
order for
                   ∗
                 P0,1 : L2 (G, Cl(T ∗ G)) → L2 (G2 , Cl(T ∗ G2 ))
to be an embedding of Hilbert spaces, and in fact to be defined at the level of
Clifford bundles, the map induced by P0,1 at the level of cotangent bundles,
                ∗
also denoted P0,1 , must be metric.

    Let w ∈ Tg G. It is easy to see that

                    P0,1 (w) = (Rg2−1 w, Lg1−1 w),    g1 g2 = g,

. We ensure that P0,1  : T ∗ G → T ∗ G2 is metric by defining the inner product
    ∗ 2
on T G

               h(w1 , w2 ), (w3 , w4 )i2 = (hw1 , w3 i + hw2 , w4 i).

   Denote by Ei the cotangent vector field which is dual to Êi via h·, ·i.
Using the inner product on G2 we get from P0,1     ∗
                                                     (Ei ) a vector field on G2 . A
small computation shows that this vector field equals
                          (Lg1 Lg2 Rg2−1 êi , Lg2 êi ) =: (Eˆi1 , Êi2 ).                     (2)

Put Eˆi+ = (Êi1 , Êi2) and Eˆi− = (Eˆi1 , −Eˆi2 ). Since {Êi± }i is an orthonormal frame
for T G2 it is natural to try to define
                                    X                    X

where ξ ∈ L2 (G2 , Cl(T ∗ G2 )) and where {Ei± } is the corresponding orthonor-
mal frame for T ∗ G2 . A small computation shows that
                      Eˆi+ (P0,1
                             ∗           ∗
                                 ξ) = 2P0,1 (Êi (ξ)), ξ ∈ L2 (G)

We therefore define
                                                                                        !

Next, write an element in ξ ∈ L2 (G, T ∗ G) as

                               ξ=        ξi Ei ,
                                                   i

where ξi ∈ L2 (G). Hence

satisfying
                        ∇Ê + (Ej+ ) = P0,1

3.2    A Riemannian metric
Due to lemma 2.2.2 we have at each level the identification Ak = Gnk , where
nk is the number of edges in Γk . We want to construct a Riemannian metric
on T Ak = T Gnk . However, we require the metric to be consistent with the
embeddings of graphs. Embeddings of graphs Γk ⊂ Γk+1 induces a surjective
smooth map
                            Pk,k+1 : Ak+1 → Ak ,
and therefore a map of tangent bundles

                           (Pk,k+1)∗ : T Ak+1 → T Ak .

Dualizing this map we get an embedding
                             ∗
                            Pk,k+1 : T ∗ Ak → T ∗ Ak+1

of cotangent bundles.
    We want to construct the Hilbert space on which the Dirac operator acts
as a inductive limit of Hilbert spaces. It is hence natural to construct the
metric on the cotangent bundle of Ak , since we have canonical maps
                  ∗
                 Pk,k+1 : L2 (Ak , T ∗Ak ) → L2 (Ak+1 , T ∗ Ak+1).

Definition 3.2.1 Let h·, ·i be a left and right invariant Riemannian metric
on T ∗ G. Let Γk be the graph consisting of the edges in Tk , the k’s barycentric
subdivision of T0 . On T ∗ Ak = T ∗ Gnk define
                                             1
                                 h·, ·ik =      h·, ·ink ,                   (3)
                                             2k
where h·, ·ink is the product metric on T ∗ Gnk .



                                             19
Proposition 3.2.2 The map
                                       ∗
                                      Pk,k+1 : T ∗ Ak → T ∗ Ak+1
preserves the metric (3).
   Proof. We subdivide Gnk+1 as G2nk × Gn2 , where G2nk corresponds to
subdivision of the edges in Γk and Gn2 corresponds to the new edges added
when going from k to k + 1. Write
                     T(g∗ 1 ,...,gn       Ak+1 = Tg∗1 G ⊕ · · · ⊕ Tg∗n       G.
                                  k+1 )                                k+1

We choose orientations of the edges in such a way that
                Pk,k+1(g1 , . . . , gnk+1 ) = (g1 g2 , g3 g4 , . . . , g2nk−1 g2nk ).
For a tangent vector v = (v1 , . . . , vnk+1 ) in T ∗ Ak+1 we have
(Pk,k+1)∗ (v) = (Lg1 v2 + Rg2 v1 , Lg3 v4 + Rg4 v3 , . . . , Lg2nk −1 v2nk + Rg2nk v2nk −1 ),
where Lg means left translation of tangent vectors and Rg right translation.
Hence for a cotangent vector w = (w1 , . . . , wnk ) in T(g∗ 1 g2 ,...,g2n −1 g2n ) Ak we
                                                                          k      k
have
        ∗
       Pk,k+1 (w) = (Rg2−1 w1 , Lg1−1 w1 , . . . , Rg2n
                                                     −1 wn , L2n −1 wn , 0, . . . , 0),
                                                          k     k     k
                                                            k

where by definition
 Lg (w)(v) = w(Lg−1 (v)),              Rg (w)(v) = w(Rg−1 (v)),          v ∈ T G,       w ∈ T ∗ G.
From this and the left and right invariance of h·, ·i the proposition follows. ⊳

                                       ∗                                 ∗
    By proposition 3.2.2 the map Pk,k+1     induces a map, also denoted Pk,k+1 ,
           ∗             ∗                     ∗
from Cl(T Ak ) to Cl(T Ak+1), where Cl(T Ak ) denotes the Clifford bundle
of T ∗ Ak with respect to h·, ·ik . Furthermore this map is isometric. We thus
get embeddings of Hilbert spaces
               ∗
              Pk,k+1 : L2 (Ak , Cl(T ∗ Ak )) → L2 (Ak+1 , Cl(T ∗ Ak+1).
Definition 3.2.3 Put Hk = L2 (Ak , Cl(T ∗ Ak )). Define
                                             H = lim Hk ,
                                                   −→
                                            ∗
the inductive limit of of the system {Hk , Pk,k+1 }k .
                                                                             △          △
    Due to proposition 2.4.2 we can consider H as L2 (A , Cl(A )) or more
freely written L2 (A, Cl(A)).

3.3    Some special covector fields
For the general construction of the Dirac operator we will need some special
covector fields generalizing duals of the vector fields (2). For notational
simplicity we will only present the construction on a single edge which is
                                                         n
then subdivided infinitely many times. Thus An = G2 and the structure
maps are given by

              Pn−1,n (g1 , g2 , . . . , g2n −1 , g2n ) = (g1 g2 , . . . , g2n −1 g2n ).

Let {ei } be an orthonormal basis of Tid∗ G. Define covector fields on A0 = G
by
                             Ei0,1 (g) = Lg (ei ).
The construction of the covector fields on An will be by induction. Assume
that covector fields
                             {Eij,k }j≤n−1,k≤2j−1
on An−1 has been defined (For j = 0 the set k ≤ 2j−1 is {1}). We adopt the
notation

                            Ei1 = Lg1 g2 ···g2n R(g2 g3 ···g2n )−1 ei
                            Ei2 = Lg2 g3 ···g2n R(g3 g4 ···g2n )−1 ei
                                ..
                                 .

for covector fields on G depending on g1 , . . . , g2n . Define covector fields on
An by
                            ∗
                          {Pn−1,n (Eij,k )}j≤n−1,k≤2j−1
and

                        Ein,1 = 2n−1(Ei1 , −Ei2 , 0, . . . , 0)
                        Ein,2 = 2n−1(0, 0, Ei3, −Ei4 , 0, . . . , 0)
                              ..
                               .

With sloppy notation we will also write Eij,k instead of Pn−1,n
                                                          ∗

Lemma 3.3.1 {Eij,k }j≤n,k≤2j−1 is an orthonormal frame for T ∗ An with re-
spect to the inner product h·, ·in.


                                                21
                       ∗
    Proof. Since Pn−1,n     preserves the inner product by proposition 3.2.2 it
is enough to check that {Ein,k }k≤2j−1 are orthonormal and are orthogonal to
{Eij,k }j≤n−1,k≤2j−1 .
    It is clear that {Ein,k }k≤2j−1 are orthonormal. By induction and the
computation in the proof of proposition 3.2.2 we see that the vectors in
{Eij,k }j≤n−1,k≤2j−1 are of the form
                                                                   n               n
               (c1 Ei1 , c1 Ei2 , c2 Ei3, c2 Ei4, . . . , c2n−1 Ei2 −1 , c2n−1 Ei2 ).

From this the lemma follows.                                                            ⊳

3.4    Construction of the Dirac operator
We want to construct a Dirac type operator acting on H. For this we con-
                                                                              ∗
struct Dirac type operators acting on Hn which are consistent with Pn,n+1          .
We first need to determine sufficient conditions on the connections which
permit the existence of the Dirac operator.
    Let Êij,k be the vector field obtained from Eij,k by using h·, ·in to identify
T ∗ An with T An . Also let êi denote the basis in Tid G obtained from ei by
using h·, ·i to identify Tid G with Tid∗ G. Note also under this identification the
covectorfield
                                 (0, . . . , 0, Eij , 0, . . .)
gets mapped to
                  1
                     (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1 ···g2n )−1 êi , 0, . . . , 0).

We want to define the Dirac operator in the usual fashion using an admissible
family of connection, i.e. at each level it should be on the form

3.5       Gauge invariance
                                                                             △          △
In section 2.2.2 we have constructed a left action of G on A . It follows from
                                                                       △
the construction that this action preserves the inner product on L2 (A ), and
                                △            △
hence is a unitary action of G on L2 (A ). In order to talk about gauge
invariance of of the Dirac operator we first need to extend this action to a
                         △      △
unitary action on L2 (A , Cl(A )).
    Let U be a gauge transformation written as
                                                                               −1
                      Un (g1 , . . . , g2n ) = (u0 g1 u−1
                                                       1 , . . . , u2n −1 g2n u2n ),

on An , where u0 , . . . , u2n ∈ G. Since the metric is left and right invariant in
each copy of G, we see that (Un )∗ : T ∗ An → T ∗ An preserves the metric and
                                              △        △
therefore U extends to a unitary on L2 (A , Cl(A )). This unitary will also
be denoted by U.
   A vectorfield of the form

              (g1 , . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1 ···g2n )−1 êi , 0, . . . , 0)

gets mapped to

                                                      25
Therefore (Un )∗ is, on a covector field of the form
           (g1 , . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1 ···g2n )−1 ei , 0, . . . , 0),
given by

Put fi = u2n ei u2n . Since {fi } be another orthonormal basis for the dual of
the Lie algebra of G, there exist a matrix Oij ∈ O(dim(G)) with
                                       X
                                  fi =    Oij ej .

From the construction of the covector fields {Eij,k } it follows that
                                       X
                           U(Eij,k ) =    Oil Elj,k .

4      A semifinite spectral triple
                                                                                       △
In this section we will construct a semifinite spectral associated to A or
rather to the algebra of holonomy loops, see definition 4.1.1. The following
definition first appeared [6].

Definition 4.0.3 Let N be a semifinite von Neumann algebra with a semifi-
nite trace τ . Let Kτ be the τ - compact operators. A semifinite spectral triple
(B, H, D) is a ∗-subalgebra B of N , a representation of N on the Hilbert space
H and an unbounded densely defined self adjoint operator D on H affiliated
with N satisfying

    1. b(λ − D)−1 ∈ Kτ for all b ∈ B and λ ∈
                                           / R..

    2. [b, D] is densely defined and extends to a bounded operator.

4.1     The algebra
Let v be a vertex in S△ . Denote by HGv (S△ ) the subgroupoid of HG(S△ )
of loops based in v, i.e. paths starting and ending in v. Let G → MN be a


                                                  27
unitary matrix representation of G and let H′ = H ⊗ MN . Hence
                              H′ = lim(Hn ⊗ MN ).
                                     −→



Definition 4.1.1 Let L be a loop in HGv (S△ ). Let ξ ∈ Hn ⊗ MN , where n
is such that L ∈ HG(n). Define
              L(ξ)(∇) = ∇(L)ξ(∇),         ∇ ∈ An = Hom(HG(n), G).
Since
                              ∗               ∗
                             Pn,m (L(ξ)) = L(Pn,m (ξ))
we get a densely defined operator on H′ , also denoted L. Clearly L is bounded.
    Denote by Bv the ∗-algebra generated by {L}L∈HGv (S△ ) . We will call Bv
the algebra of holonomy loops.
Proposition 4.1.2 For L ∈ HGv (S△ ) define the function HL : A → MN
by
                        HL(∇) = Hol(L, ∇).
The ∗-algebra generated by {HL}L∈HGv (S△ ) equipped with the sup norm is
isomorphic to Bv as normed ∗-algebra.
                                                         △
      Proof. Follows from the dense embedding A → A .                           ⊳

4.2      The trace and the von Neumann algebra
Let
                   An = K(L2 (An )) ⊗ Cl(Tid∗ An ) ⊗ End(MN ).
where K(L2 (An )) denotes the compact operators on L2 (An ). We define maps,
                                         ∗
with an abuse of notation also denoted Pn,n+1 , from An to An+1 in the fol-
lowing way
                      ∗
      • On End(MN ), Pn,n+1 is the identity.
      • On K(L2 (An )), Pn,n+1
                         ∗
                               is the map induced by the embedding
                              ∗
                             Pn,n+1 : L2 (An ) → L2 (An+1),
        i.e. if Pn,n+1 denotes the projection in L2 (An+1 ) onto Pn,n+1
                                                                  ∗
                                                                        (L2 (An ))
        we have
                       K(L2 (An )) ∋ a → aPn,n+1 ∈ K(L2 (An+1)).

                                          28
   • We use the map

                       Pn,n+1 : Cl(T ∗ An ) → Cl(T ∗ An+1 ),

     which has already been defined in subsection 3.2 and restrict it to the
     identity. If we write

                              Tid∗ An+1 = Tid∗ An ⊕ Vn,n+1,

     and hence
                     Cl(Tid∗ An+1 ) = Cl(Tid∗ An ) ˆ
                                                  ⊗Cl(Vn,n+1),
     then
                        ∗
                       Pn,n+1 : Cl(Tid∗ An ) → Cl(Tid∗ An+1 )
     is given by
                               ∗
                              Pn,n+1 (E) = E ⊗ 1Cl(Vn,n+1 ) .
             ∗
Note that Pn,n+1 is a C ∗ -algebra homomorphism. Therefore {An } is an in-
ductive system of C ∗ -algebras. Let

                                   A = lim An

be the inductive limit. By
                                  ∗
                                 Pn,∞ : An → A,

we denote the induced embeddings.
   From the construction of A it follows that

                        A = K(L2 (A)) ⊗ B ⊗ MN ,                         (4)

where B is a UHF-algebra. Since the dimension of the Clifford algebra is a
power of 2 when n ≥ 1, B is the CAR-algebra.
   There is a trace T r on Ak defined by

                             T r = T ro ⊗ T rn ⊗ T ro ,

where T ro are the operator traces on K(L2 (Ak )), resp. End(MN ) and T rn
is the normalized trace on Cl(Tid∗ Ak ). By construction
                                           ∗
                             T r(a) = T r(Pk,k+1 (a)),

                                        29
and hence defines a densely defined trace on A.
   Using the trivialization {Eij,k } of Tid∗ An we see that A acts on H′ . In fact
H′ factors like (4) into

                                 H′ = L2 (A) ⊗ Cl(Tid∗ A) ⊗ MN .

Note that the action of B on Cl(Tid∗ A) is just the GNS-representation of B
with respect to the normalized trace on B.

Definition 4.2.1 Let N be the weak closure of A in B(H′ ). The trace τ :
N → C is defined as the extension of the trace T r on A to N .

    Note that τ is a semifinite trace, since it is the tensor product of the usual
semifinite trace on B(H), H separable, and the finite trace on the hyperfinite
             w
II1 factor B .

4.3      A coordinate change and selfadjointness of the Dirac
         operator
We define the coordinate transformation
                                                             n           n
                                        Θ n : A n = G2 → G2

by
          Θn (g1 , . . . , g2n ) = (g1 g2 · · · g2n , g2 g3 · · · g2n , . . . , g2n −1 g2n , g2n ).
                                                                                           n
It is easy to see that Θn preserves the Haar measure on G2 .
    The inverse of θn is given by
                                               −1      −1                  −1
                 Θ−1
                  n (g1 , . . . , g2n ) = (g1 g2 , g2 g3 , . . . , g2n −1 g2n , g2n ),

   The main purpose of Θn is the following:
                     n−1
   An is a trivial G2 -principal fiber bundle over An−1, where the action
     n−1
of G2    on An is given by
                                                                                                         ′
      (g1 , . . . , g2n−1 )(g1′ , . . . , g2′ n ) = (g1′ g1−1 , g1g2′ , . . . , g2′ n −1 g2−1
                                                                                            n−1 , g2n−1 g2n ).




                                                        30
Combining this with Θn we get the following commutative diagram

where pro means projection onto the odd coordinates, i.e.

                      pro (g1 , g2 , . . . , g2n −1 , g2n ) = (g1 , g3, . . . , g2n −1 ).

In other words {Θn } is just a consistent way of trivializing the principal
bundles.

Lemma 4.3.1 Let Êi (g) = Lg (êi ), the left translate of êi . On An we have

Proposition 4.3.2 Let {∇n } be an admissible system of connections. As-
sume that D0 is self adjoint,

               ∇nÊ j,k (Eln,m ) = 0 for all i, j, k, m, l, and all n ≥ 1
                  i


and that aj,k are real and non zero for all j, k. Then D is self adjoint.

    Proof. We will prove that Dn is formally self adjoint for each n. From this
the statement follows because Dn is an elliptic pseudo differential operator
on a compact manifold and therefore by elliptic regularity Dn is self adjoint.
We can even find an orthonormal basis for Hn′ which diagonalizes Dn with
real eigenvalues. We can therefore find an orthonormal basis for H′ which
diagonalizes D with real eigenvalues. Hence D is self adjoint.
    Write             X                         X
                Dn =      a0,1 Ei0,1 ∇nÊ 0,1 +   aj,k Eij,k ∇nÊ j,k .
                                         i                         i
                         i                        1≤j≤n,k,i

By the assumptions on the connection and lemma 4.3.1 the first summand
on the right hand side is a linear combination of D0 ’s acting on the different
copies of G, and thus by assumption self adjoint. The second summand is,
in the trivialization induced by {Eij,k } and transported by Θn on the form
                             X
                                   aj,k Eij,k d(Θn )∗ (Ê j,k ) ,

                             1≤j≤n,k,i


where d is the exterior derivative. Since (Θn )∗ (Êij,k ) is a left invariant vector
field according to lemma 4.3.1, d(Θn )∗ (Ê j,k ) is formally skew self adjoint. The
                                              i

formal selfadjointness now follows since Clifford multiplication with Eij,k is
also skew self adjoint and commutes with d(Θn )∗ (Ê j,k ) .                 ⊳

4.4     Affiliation of D
The spectral projections of Dn will by construction belong to

                  K(L2 (An )) ⊗ End(Cl(Tid∗ An )) ⊗ End(MN ).

Since we can split Cl(Tid∗ An ) into irreducible representations of Cl(Tid∗ An ),
and Dn acts on each of these, the spectral projections of Dn is in

                  An = K(L2 (An )) ⊗ Cl(Tid∗ An ) ⊗ End(MN ).

                                             32
   Recall from section 4.2 the splitting

                          Tid∗ An+1 = Tid∗ An ⊕ Vn,n+1.

More generally we can write

                            Tid∗ Am = Tid∗ An ⊕ Vn,m ,

and we thus have

                     Cl(Tid∗ Gm ) = Cl(Vn,m ) ˆ
                                             ⊗Cl(Tid∗ An ).                     (5)

    We assume that the system of connections defining the Dirac operator
satisfies the properties in 4.3.2. These properties ensure the following equa-
tion:
             ∗               ∗
        Dm (Pn,m (ξ) ⊗ v) = Pn,m (Dn (ξ)) ⊗ v,       ξ ∈ Hn′ , v ∈ Cl(Vn,m ).
                                                 ∗
If ξ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ, then Pn,m  (ξ)⊗v is an eigenvector with
eigenvalue λ if v ∈ Cl(Vn,m ). Therefore, if Pλ,n is the spectral of eigenvalue λ
                         ∗
of Dn the projection Pn,∞   (Pλ,n ) is a subprojection of the spectral projection
                                            ∗
of eigenvalue λ of D. By construction Pn,∞     (Pλ,n ) ∈ N
                                                                                ⊳

Proposition 4.4.1 The spectral projections of the Dirac operator is con-
tained in N .

   Proof. For a spectral projection Pλ of eigenvalue λ of D we have
                                ∗
                               Pn,∞ (Pλ,n ) ր Pλ .

Hence Pλ is in the weak closure of A, i.e. Pλ ∈ N .                              ⊳

Corollary 4.4.2 The operator D is affiliated with N .

4.5    The main theorem
We begin by enlarging our Hilbert space slightly. Let H = H′ ⊗ Cl(1). We
also enlarge N by tensoring with Cl(1). By abuse of notation we will also
call the enlargement N . The trace τ is also enlarged by tensoring with the
normalized trace on Cl(1) and denoted by τ .

                                       33
   The Dirac operator extends to an operator on H. We write
               X                          X
        Dn =        aj,k Eij,k ∇nÊ j,k +   an,k Ein,k ∇nÊ n,k = Dn+ + Dn− .
                                     i                         i
                 j<n,k,i                       k,i

After changing coordinates with Θn we have
                                X
                         Dn− =     an,k Ein,k ∇nÊ 2k .
                                                           i
                                         k,i

Therefore, when we use Θn to trivialize
                                                         n−1
                                An = An−1 × G2
                                                                                n−1
we see that Dn− is an operator acting only in the fiber, i.e. in the G2               part
of An . There is an embedding of

                     L2 (An−1 ) ⊗ Cl(Tid∗ An ) ⊗ MN ⊗ Cl(1)                            (6)

in Ker(Dn− ) by identifying it as a subspace of Hn . Let Pn be the projection
onto the orthogonal complement of (6) in Ker(Dn− ). Define
                                         X
                           Dn,p = Dn +      bj ePj ,
                                                     j

                                                                   ∗
where bj ∈ iR, e is the generator of Cl(1) and where we have used Pj,j+1 to
push forward Pj . Note that Dn,p is self adjoint. By construction
                            ∗
                           Pn,n+1 (Dn,p (ξ)) = Dn+1,p (ξ),

and therefore {Dn,p } defines a densely defined self adjoint operator Dp on H.
Since D is affiliated with N by corollary 4.4.2, so is Dp by construction.
Theorem 4.5.1 There exist sequences {aj,k } and {bk } such that (Bv , H, Dp )
is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to (N , τ ).
   Proof. The selfadjointness and affiliation to N of Dp are already taken
care of. What remains is to prove that [b, Dp ] ∈ B(H) and that b(λ−Dp )−1 ∈
Kτ for all b ∈ Bv .
   The boundedness of the commutator: Let L be a loop in Γn . If we write
                                 n
                   Hn = L2 (G2 ) ⊗ Cl(T ∗ An ) ⊗ MN ⊗ Cl(1)

                                               34
                                                                                          n
the loop operator L acts by point wise matrix multiplication over G2 in
the MN factor, i.e. the matrix entries is of the form f (g1 , . . . , g2n ). The
action of L on Hn+1 is then matrix multiplication with entries of the form
f (g1 g2 , . . . , g2n+1 −1 g2n+1 ). Conjugating the operator with Θn+1 we see, since
                                            −1      −1                  −1
          Θ−1
           n+1 (g1 , . . . , g2n+1 ) = (g1 g2 , g2 g3 , . . . , g2n −1 g2n+1 , g2n+1 ),
                                                                          −
that the result is independent of g2 , g4 , . . . , g2n+1 , and thus [L, Dn+1 ] = 0.
It therefore follows that [L, Pn+1 ] = 0. Hence [L, Dn+1,p ] = [L, Dn,p ] and
therefore [L, Dp ] is bounded.
    To prove that there exist sequences {aj,k } and bj such Dp has τ -compact
resolvent we will prove that for any real sequence cn converging to ∞ we can
choose an,k and bn such that the new eigenvalues, modulo the extra multi-
plicity of the existing eigenvalue due to the growth of the Clifford bundle,
introduced by going from (Dn−1,p )2 to (Dn,p )2 are bigger than cn .
    In the following we will omit the MN part. This will play no role, since the
Dirac operator does not act on the MN part. First we rewrite the operator
in the following way

by lemma 4.3.1, Dn,p acts trivially on H1 . Taking the square of Dn,p we get

Pk,k+1 that this complement is an invariant subspace for Dp . Decompose ξ

where Êi is an orthonormal frame of left translated vectorfields on one copy
of G, has a non trivial kernel in the sense that the kernel is given by the span
of {Ei }i . This is clearly not the case for U(1). In the appendix we will show
that this is also not the case for SU(2).

Proposition 4.5.2 When Db is constructed from a gauge admissible sys-
tem of connections satisfying the demands in proposition 4.3.2, Db is gauge
                                          △
invariant, i.e. Db = UDb U ∗ for all U ∈ G . (U acts trivially on the Cl(1)-
part.)

    Proof. From the proof of proposition 3.5.2 it follows that Dn− is gauge
invariant, i.e. invariant under Un for all Un ∈ Gn . In particular the kernel of
Dn− is gauge invariant. Also the space (6) is invariant under Gn and therefore
the projection Pn onto the orthogonal complement of (6) in the kernel of Dn−
is gauge invariant under Gn . From this the invariance follows.                ⊳

    Note that the system of trivial connections with respect to the trivializa-
tions given by {Eij,k } fulfills the the demands of proposition 4.5.2.


5     Appendix
In this appendix we will first demonstrate the case of U(1) to show what kind
of growth conditions are needed on aj,k . Secondly we show that for SU(2)
the perturbation with the Pn ’s is not needed to obtain a semifinite spectral
triple.

                                  aj,k Eij,k dÊ j,k
                                                            i
                                     j≤n,k,i

Since i can be only one in this formula, we will simply omit it. Also we will
assume that aj,k1 = aj,k2 for all k1 , k2 , and simply denote aj := aj,k . All Eˆj,k
commute. Hence                         X
                            Dn2 = −          a2j (dÊ j,k )2 .
                                              j≤n,k

Since Dn2 acts trivially in the Clifford bundle, and since the identity on the
Clifford bundle is normalized to have trace 1, we will omit the Clifford bundle
in the rest of this computation.
    We will use the coordinate change Θn to rewrite Dn2 . The rewritten
operator will be denoted D̃n2 . According to lemma 4.3.1 the vector fields
Ê j,k = cj,k      j,k      j,k      j,k              j,k             j,k

gets mapped to
  X j,k               X j,k        X j,k
2    cl ∂θ1 + (c1 + 2  cl )∂θ2 + 2  cl ∂θ3 + . . . + 2cj,k             j,k
                                                       2n−1 ∂θ2n −1 + c2n−1 ∂θ2n
  l=1                    l=2                   l=2

under Θn , and Eˆn,k gets mapped to − 21 ∂θ2k . It follows from the construction
that                          X j,k
                                  |c2n−1 |2 < 1.
                                     j<n,k

In particular for a function
                           ξ(θ1 , . . . , θ2n ) = e2πiθ2n l ,   l∈Z
we see that
                                              X                       a2n
                       D̃n2 (ξ) = 4π 2 l2 (           (cj,k      2

                                              j<n,k
                                                                      4

From this follows, that D only has finite many eigenvalues with finite multi-
plicity module the semifinite trace in a bounded set of R if
                                      an → ∞.                                 (9)
This is therefore a necessary condition for D to have τ -compact resolvent.
   On the other hand the eigenfunctions for D̃n2 are on the form
                                      X
                             exp(2πi(     nl θl )).
                                            l≤2n

                         2
The eigenfunctions for D̃n−1 are the functions on the form
                                    X
                           exp(2πi(      n2l−1 θl )).
                                       l≤2n−1

Hence the smallest new eigenvalue appearing from going to from n − 1 to n
is bigger than a2n . Hence D has τ -compact resolvent if and only of condition
(9) is satisfied.

5.2    The SU (2)-case
We will show that the Dirac operator on SU(2) on the form
                                  X
                             De =     Ei dÊi ,
                                            i

where d is understood with respect to the trivialization given by {Ei }, has
a trivial kernel in the sense that the kernel is given by the span of {Ei }i .
In other words the kernel consists of the constants with respect to the triv-
ialization of the Clifford bundle given by {Ei }i . Accoording to the remark
after the proof of 4.5.1 this ensures that the perturbation with the Pn ’s is
not needed.
    For the analysis of we will use that states |jmi, where j ∈ {0, 12 , 1, . . .}
and m ∈ {−j, −j + 1, . . . j − 1, j} form an orthonormal basis for L2 (SU(2)).
Choose a basis ê1 , ê2 , ê3 for su(2) such that
                                                   X
                                    [êi , êj ] =   εijk êk .
                                                k


                                            39
Define a metric on su(2) by letting ê1 , ê2 , ê3 be an orthonormal basis. Note
this metric by left and right translation define a left and right invariant metric
on SU(2).
    The action of the corresponding left translated vectorfields of ê1 , ê2 , ê3 is
best described by forming the raising and lowering operators

                                    ê± = ê1 ± iê2 .

The action of the translated vectorfields is given by

            dÊ3 |jmi = −im|jmi,         dÊ± |jmi = −ic± (m)|jm ± 1i,

where                               p
                         c± (m) =    (j ∓ m)(j ± m + 1).
We will restrict the operator De to acting in one of the two irreducible repre-
sentations of Cl(Tid∗ SU(2)) instead of the full Clifford bundle. We chose the
representation in M2 given by
                                                              
                   0 1                  0 i                  i 0
        E1 =               , E2 =                , E3 =               ,
                  −1 0                  i 0                  0 −i

The Dirac operator therefore has the form
                                                      

                −1 0                 i 0              0 −i

which is rewritten to
                                                     
                 0 1                0 0              i 0

are invariant under De2 . Therefore analyzing De2 is the same as analyzing
matrices of the form
                                                     
                     j(j + 1) + m       −ic− (m)

                         ic− (m)    j(j + 1) − m + 1
A lower bound for the product of the diagonal term is j 4 . The off diagonal
can be estimated by
        c− (m)2 = (j + m)(j − m + 1) = j 2 + j − m2 + m ≤ j 2 + 2j.
Hence for j ≥ 23 these matrices are clearly invertible. For j = 1 and j = 21 it
can easily be checked that these matrices are invertible. In particular we see
that De2 has trivial kernel.
    Choosing the other irreducible representation of Cl(Tid∗ SU(2)) corresponds
to replacing E3 with −E3 and therefore De2 in this representation also has
trivial kernel.
