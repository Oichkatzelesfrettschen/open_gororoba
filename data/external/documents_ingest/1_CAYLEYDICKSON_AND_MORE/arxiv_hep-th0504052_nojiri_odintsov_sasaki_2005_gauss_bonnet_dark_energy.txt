W e propose the G auss-B onnet dark energy m odel inspired by string/M -theory w here standard
gravity w ith scalar contains additionalscalar-dependent coupling w ith G auss-B onnet invariant. It
is dem onstrated that e ective phantom (or quintessence) phase of late universe m ay occur due to
presence ofsuch term w hich is relevant even at sm allcurvature. H ow ever,w ith the increase ofthe
curvaturethe scalarpotentialm ay becom e dom inantso thatphantom phase istransientand w = 1
barrier m ay be passed. H ence,the current acceleration of the universe m ay be caused by stringy
e ects. It is rem arkable that scalar-G auss-B onnet coupling acts against the B ig R ip occurence also
in phantom cosm ology realized by scalar w ith negative kinetic energy.

I. IN T R O D U C T IO N

It becam e clear recently that late-tim e dynam ics ofthe currentaccelerated universe is governed by the m ysterious
dark energy. T he interpretation ofthe astrophysicalobservationsindicates that such dark energy uid (ifit is uid!)
is characterized by the negative pressure and its equation ofstate param eter w lies very close to 1 (m ost probably
below ofit). Q uite possible that it m ay be oscillating around 1. It is extrem ely di cult to present the com pletely
satisfactory theory ofthe dark energy (also due to lack ofallrequiered astrophysicaldata),especially in the case of
(oscillating)w lessthan 1.(Forinstance,therm odynam icsisquite strange there w ith possible negative entropy [1]).
T he successfuldark energy theory m ay be searched in string/M -theory. Indeed,it is quite possible that som e unusualgravity-m attercouplingspredicted by the fundam entaltheory m ay becom e im portantatcurrent,low -curvature
universe (being notessentialin interm ediate epoch from strong to low curvature).Forinstance,in the study ofstringinduced gravity near to initialsingularity the role ofG auss-B onnet (G B ) coupling w ith scalar was quite im portant
for ocurrence of non-singular cosm ology [2, 3] (for account of dilaton and higher order corrections near to initial
singularity,see also [4]). T he present paper is devoted to the study ofthe role ofG B coupling w ith the scalar eld
to the late-tim e universe. It is explicitly dem onstrated that such term m ay induce the e ective phantom late-tim e
universe.Itm ay produce also the e ective quintessence era,explaining the currentacceleration by late-tim e e ectsof
stringy origin. Itis interesting that itm ay also have the im portantim pactto the B ig R ip singularity [5],sim ilarly to
quantum e ects [6,7],preventing it in the standard phantom cosm ology caused by negative kinetic energy ofscalar.
N ote that we concentrate m ainly on the exponentialscalar-G B coupling and exponentialscalar potential,w hile the
consideration ofother types ofsuch functions and their role in late tim e cosm ology w illbe considered elsew here.

0 vanishes w hen h0 = 0 or h0 = 1 and goes to in nity w hen h 0 goes to 3=7. T he qualitative behavior of 0 versus
h0 is given in Figure 1. T hen there are always three solutions for h0 from (20),one is negative and other two are
positive. W e should also note thatthe solution corresponding to the phantom cosm ology w ith h0 < 0 appearsforany
value of 20 . A s is show n in A ppendix,the solution w ith h0 < 0 is stable under the perturbations. T he quintessence
dark energy era,w here h0 > 1,also appears for any value of 20 . T he solution is again stable. For the third solution,
we nd 0 < h0 < 3=7,w hich is not phantom nor quintessence phase.

w hich corresponds to (20). T hen w hen = 1,the solutions of(37) are not qualitatively changed from those of(20),
and there are three solutions h0 < 0,0 < h0 < 3=7,and h0 > 1. O n the other hand,w hen = 1,since the sign of
the r.h.s. in (20) is changed from
= 1 case,as clear from FIG .1,there is only one positive solution for h0. T hen if
the term proportionalto the G B invariantin case < 0 (w hich correspondsto a scalarphantom solution w ithoutG B
term ) is included the e ective w becom es larger than 1 and the B ig R ip singularity is avoided (see [6]for quantum
e ects account to escape ofB ig R ip). T hat is,in case < 0,w hen the curvature is sm allas in the current universe,
the G B term is negligible and the potentialterm dom inates,w hich gives the cosm ic acceleration w ith w < 1. T hen
the curvature increases gradually and the universe seem s to tend to the B ig R ip singularity [5]. H owever,w hen the
curvature is large,the G B term becom es dom inant and prevents the singularity. H ence,in case < 0,the G B term
works against the B ig R ip singularity occurence,like quantum e ects [6]. W e should note,however,w hen > 0,the
h
G B term generates the B ig R ip singularity,w here the scale factor behaves as a (ts t) 0 w ith h0 < 0. A fter the
G B term dom inates w hen < 0,the curvature turns to becom e sm aller. T hen the postentialterm would dom inate
again. T his m ight tellthat the behavior ofthe universe m ight approach to the deSitter sapce w ith w = 1 by the
dam pted oscillation. In fact even in the m odel(33),if(31) is assum ed,there is a deSitter solution corresponding to

In (33),we have assum ed > 1. Ifwe consider the case that V ( ) = V0 e 0 and f( ) = f0e 0 as in (33) but
0 < < 1,there appearsa solution w here the term including G B invariantbecom esdom inanteven ifthe curvature is
sm all. B y assum ing (34)or(35),Eq.(36)is obtained again.H ence,w hen 0 < < 1,the solution w here h0 is positive
or w > 1 even if < 0 (scalar phantom ) appears.
O n the other hand, there is accelerated universe solution w ith w < 1, that is, h0 < 0 due to the G B term
even if > 0. In this case, w hen the curvature is large, the potential is dom inant and the solution is given by
(17) w here w > 1 as long as > 0. T he follow ing scenario m ight be possible: in the current expanding universe
w ith sm allcurvature the e ective w < 1,due to the G B term . W ith such phantom phase,the curvature grow s.
W hen the curvature becom es large enough,the potentialterm is dom inant and the universe expands w ith e ective
equation of state param eter w > 1. H ence, phantom phase is transient and B ig R ip does not occur eventually.
Since the curvature becom es sm aller w hen the potentialdom inates,the universe m ay approach to deSitter spacetim e
corresponding to (38) by the dam pted oscilation. In any case,in spite ofthe sign of ,one m ay obtain the solution
describing the phantom cosm ology w ith w < 1 w hen the curvature is sm alland the quintessence (m atter) era w ith
w > 1 w hen the curvature is large.

IV . D ISC U SSIO N

W e considered essentially two m odels w ith exponentialcouplings given by (11) and (33). T he m odel(11) m ay be
considered as the specialcase corresponding to = 1. T he m ain results can be sum m arized as follow s:
1. = 1 case: exactly solvable
(a) V = 0 case: T here are three solutions corresponding to w <

1, 1 < w <

1=3,and w > 5=9.

2.1= < 1 case: the potentialterm dom inates for sm allcurvature and the G B term for large one.
(a)

> 0: T here appears the B ig R ip singularity.

7
(b)

< 0: T he solution asym ptotically approaches to the deSitter space.

3.1= > 1 case: the potentialterm dom inates for large curvature and the G B term for sm allone.
(a)

> 0: T he solution asym ptotically approaches to the deSitter space.

(b)

< 0: T here w illappear the B ig R ips singularity.

For the m odels (11) and (33),in case V0 = 0 (that is,w hen the potentialvanishes),by replacing 0 w ith 0 ,it
follow s the two m odels are equivalent. Especially = 1 case has been wellstudied and it has been show n that there
are alwaysthree e ective cosm ologicalphasescorresponding to the phantom w ith h 0 < 0 orw < 1,the quintessence
w ith h0 > 1 or 1 < w < 1=3,and the m atter w ith 0 < h0 < 3=7 or w > 5=9. Even ifV0 6
= 0,the m odel(11)
can be solved exactly and the solutions w here h0 and therefore w are constants m ay be found. O n the other hand,
ifV0 6
= 0,the m odel(33) cannot be solved exactly but there exist the solutions w here the values ofh0 and therefore
ofw are tim e-dependent. T here could em erge a cosm ology,w hich behaves as phantom one w ith w < 1 w hen the
curvature issm alland asa usualm atterdom inated universe w ith w > 1 w hen the curvature islarge.M oreover,B ig
R ip singularity does not occur.
O ur study indicates that current acceleration m aybe caused by stringy/M -theory e ects (term s) w hich som ehow
becam e relevantquite recently (in cosm ologicalsense). Itrem ainsa challenge to constructthe consistentdark energy
universe m odelfrom string/M -theory.
