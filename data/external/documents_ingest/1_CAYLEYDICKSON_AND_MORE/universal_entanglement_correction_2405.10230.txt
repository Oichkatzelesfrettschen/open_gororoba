Local relevant deformations are important tool to study universal properties of quantum critical
points. We investigate the effect of small relevant deformations on the bi-partite entanglement
entropy at the quantum critical points. Within the quantum critical region, a universal power-law
correction in the entanglement entropy induced by the relevant operator is found in both one- and
two-dimensional critical lattice models. The exponent of the power-law correction term is determined
by the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. Based on numerical simulations and scaling theory
argument, it is conjectured that such a universal power-law correction in the entanglement entropy
is universal for Lorentz invariant quantum critical points. Without Lorentz invariance, it is found
the exponent in the power-law correction term does not fit in with the scaling argument in models
with a dynamical exponent z = 2 in two dimension. This may be because the relevant operator
added in the lattice model corresponds to complicated operators in the corresponding conformal
field theory. Our study provides a different perspective to extract universal information of quantum
critical points. We expect it would be useful to detect unique properties of topological quantum
phase transitions.

INTRODUCTION

Along with the recent fast development of quantum
computing technologies, the study and understanding
of quantum entanglement becomes one of the most important topics. As a key concept in quantum theories, the entanglement has already inspired many researches for both high energy and condensed matter
physics in recent years. The measure of the amount of
quantum entanglement, the entanglement entropy (EE)
S := −tr (ρA log(ρA )) (ρA is the reduced density matrix
for the sub-region A in the whole system) deepens our understanding of quantum matter in many aspects [1–22],
especially in the study of gapped quantum phases. The
famous area law for the EE in gapped ground states not
only reveals the relation between degrees of freedom in a
quantum system [1–3], but also inspired novel quantum
many-body frameworks [4–6].Moreover, a finer structure
of the entanglement, including the degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum and the long-range entanglement,
becomes the key to classify gapped topological quantum
phases [4, 7–11].
The entanglement scaling is also found important applications in critical systems [12–26]. The logarithmic
scaling of the EE becomes one of the canonical methods
to identify one-dimensional quantum critical points and
extract the central charge for the underlying conformal
field theory (CFT) [3, 12–15]. For two-dimensional quantum critical points, the corner EE is found to be related
to Goldstone modes and is utilized to diagnose a class of
controversial quantum phase transitions [23, 24]. Despite
these successful applications of entanglement in critical-

∗ pengchen@ucas.ac.cn

ity, the information of the fixed point is not included
there. For example, one can extract the central charge
from the scaling the EE, however there may be different
CFTs with the same central charge [27, 28]. A natural
question is thus how one can find universal data from
the EE. Recently it is found in one dimensions, the entanglement spectrum can be used to detect the operator
contents of the corresponding CFT in some cases, provided with some other input information [15, 25, 26, 29].
For two-dimensional universalities, or even more general
cases without emergent Lorentz invariance, it is still an
open question.
From the scaling theory viewpoint, the universal scaling form of the EE [3] at the quantum critical point allows one to resemble local physical quantities and regard it as a quantity with a scaling dimension. For
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent
Lorentz invariance, such as the two-dimensional critical
quantum Ising model on the square lattice, the EE satisfies an area law. One may expect close to the quantum
critical point, a scaling theory may be written down for
the EE and its deviation from the area law be universal.
There has already been research in this area, primarily
focusing on conformal field theory in (1+1)D and free
field theories [30, 31]. For lattice models in the quantum
critical region, especially two-dimensional models, there
is still much to explore.
In this paper, we study the effect of small relevant deformations on the entangle for both one- and
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent
Lorentz invariance on the lattice. In one dimension,
we use the finite-entanglement scaling approach based
on the infinite matrix product state (MPS) representation [11, 32–34]. The finite length scale ξ in the MPS is
introduced by the entanglement cutoff. In two dimensions, we use the correlation matrix technique [35] to

study the EE of free Dirac fermions. We consider relevant deformations with or without U (1) symmetries to
the critical fermions. Combing the numerical calculations
and the scaling theory argument, we propose there is a
universal power-law correction in the EE induced by the
relevant deformation. After that we present our study
of critical points without Lorentz invariance. Finally we
give a summary and conclusion.

II. ENTANGLEMENT CORRECTION IN ONE
DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM CRITICAL POINTS

Before we present our study of the entanglement properties of (2+1)D theories, we investigate the influence of
relevant deformations in one-dimensional quantum critical points with a underlying (1+1)D CFT description.
Since we are going to use the infinite uniform matrix
product state (MPS) framework. [32, 34, 36] to study the

where Z and X are Pauli matrices defined on the twodimensional Hilbert space. The model has a global Z2
symmetry. There is a quantum phase transition in the
ground state at hc = 1 separating the symmetry-breaking
phase h < 1 and the symmetric phase when h > 1. At the
low energy, the critical Ising model is described by the
A-series minimal model M (4, 3) CFT [27]. There are two
non-trivial relevant operator for the Ising CFT, including
the spin and the energy operator. On the lattice they are
realized by adding a longitudinal field hz or deforming the
transverse field to hc + δh, respectively.
In Fig. 1, we show the correction for the entanglement
against the finite correlation length induced by adding
a small relevant field g = δh. The relevant deformation
is the energy operator ϵ with a scaling dimension ∆ϵ =
1. The correction of the EE shows a perfect power-law
behavior ξ p with an exponent p ∼ 1.00. This is consistent
with the form Eq. 1. Interestingly, we notice that there
is a sign change for the EE correction term when adding
a positive δh > 0 or a negative δh < 0 deformation.
This is because the phase transition in the Ising model
is induced by the energy operator and there is a shift
for the critical point at finite length scales. Hence there
exists an imbalance distributions for the EE and other
physical quantities within the quantum critical region.
We also consider deforming the
Pcritical point with a
symmetry-breaking field H ′ = hz i Zi . This lattice operator realizes the spin operator σ with a scaling dimension ∆σ = 1/8 in the Ising CFT. The numerical results in
Fig. 2 confirm the power-law behavior and the exponent
p ∼ 1.88 is close to the exponent d + z − ∆σ = 15/8.
The power-law correction for the EE found in the numerical calculation in Figs. 1 and 2 may be explained
from the scaling theory argument. One can regard the
EE or exponential of the EE as a physical quantity with

3
a dimension ∆ = 0 or ∆ = −1, respectively. The EE
close to the critical point can be written down as
S(g, ξ) ∼


c
log ξ f1 (g ξ d+z−∆g ) ,
6

(3)

where the finite length scale ξ can be replaced by other
scales in different finite scaling approaches. Assuming a
small parameter g and the scaling function being smooth,
one can write down an approximated scaling theory up
to the leading correction
S(g, ξ) ∼

c
log(ξ) + cg gξ d+z−∆g + O(g 2 )
6

(4)

where cg is obtained from the expansion of the scaling
function and assumed to be non-zero. It predicts a universal power-law correction for the EE with an exponent
p = d + z − ∆g . This is consistent with our numerical
results in Fig. 1 by deforming the energy and the spin
operators.

III. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY
CORRECTION IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL FREE
LATTICE FERMIONS

In two dimensions, the underlying (2+1)D CFT [27] for
the critical lattice models is not as powerful as the onedimensional case. The numerical study of the EE is also
challenging for, e.g. tensor networks or quantum Monte
Carlo methods. Here we study the critical free lattice
fermion models, which are well under control numerically.
Thanks to the Wick theorem, the EE can be easily obtained from the single-particle correlation function [35].
Note that since the fermion annihilation/creation operator has a scaling dimension ∆ = 1, the relevant operators
we can write down must be bi-linear fermion operators
with an even fermion parity.

A.

Entanglement entropy in free Dirac fermions

In this section, we study the entanglement in critical free lattice fermion under small relevant perturbations. The critical lattice model is described by the Dirac
fermion in the low energy. We consider L × L finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions on both x and
y spatial directions. Two sub-regions A of different geometries are considered, either a L2 × L cylinder without
corners or a L2 × L2 square with four corners. The EE
between the sub-region A and its rest part Ā is calculated from the single-particle correlation defined within
the sub-region [35].
We consider the simplest lattice model that realizes
free Dirac fermions on the honeycomb lattice as shown
in Fig. 3 (a)
H = H0 + H ′

(5)

and H ′ = g Og denotes a small relevant operator. The
gapless point g = 0 can be viewed as a fine-tuning quantum critical point between the g > 0 and g < 0 gapped
phases. At the gapless point, there are two Dirac points
at the K and K ′ points in the first Brillouin zone. The
number of Dirac points must be even for lattice models [37].
Without a finite fermi surface, the EE in the Dirac
fermion model satisfies an area law S ∼ αL. Similar to
the one-dimensional case, regarding the EE as a conventional physical quantity, a power-law correction
δS ∼ gLd+z+1−∆g

(7)

is expected. Interestingly, the gapped phases induced by
a relevant field g also satisfy an area law S ∼ αg L for the
EE at large length scales L ≫ ξg . One notices that it is
very different from the the one-dimensional case studied
in the last section, in which the EE satisfies different
scaling forms between the critical point and the gapped
phase. This makes the identification of the EE response
to a mall relevant field more challenging numerically in
two dimensions. Nevertheless, we expect that within the
quantum critical region L ≪ ξg , the correction in the EE
induced by the small relevant operator can be observed,
assuming the area law coefficient does not change much
for a small deformation.

which stands for the on-site staggered chemical potential.
H ′ opens a small energy gap 1/ξm at the Dirac points.
When m changes sign, an inversion of energy bands occur. The quantum critical region is well-defined for small
systems L ≪ ξm ∼ 1/|m|. The positive and negative m
regions are related by a unitary transformation, therefor
we only consider m > 0 in the following.

We first consider the sub-region A of a cylinder geometry with a smooth entangling surface. The area law term
should dominate the scaling for the EE. As expected, the
EE shows perfect area law in the quantum critical region.

which satisfies a perfect power-law fitting. The exponent
found 1.94 is close to 2, consistent with the power-law
form Ld+z+1−∆m in which the mass term has a scaling
dimension ∆m = 2 for the free Dirac fermion.
Now we begin to study the sub-region A of a square
geometry with corners. As analysed above, the existence
of singularity points in the entangling surface leads to
another divergent logarithmic EE. To study the corner
contribution, one needs to properly subtract the area law
part. Here we define
S c (g, L) = |S(g, 2L) − 2S(g, L)|

(10)

by using the 2L × 2L and L × L lattices [38]. Such a
logarithmic divergent term is accurately produced in the
finite size scaling, see Fig. 5 (a). Turing on a small mass
perturbation, one can also observe small deviations from
the logarithmic form at large lengths. This deviation signals the correction induced by the deformation. In Fig. 5
(b), we show the scaling of the correction S (1) (g, L) defined in Eq. 9. It also satisfies a perfect power-law fitting
with an exponent 1.95 which is also consistent with the
form Ld+z+1−∆m . The existence of corners in the subregion A does not change the leading correction by the
deformation. One may wonder the corner contribution
also contains a correction term with a smaller exponent.
It belongs to next leading contribution, which is beyond
the scope of the present research.
We have concentrated on the finite size scaling (L ≪ ξ)
approach so far. It is interesting that we can also use
a different way to study the logarithmic term S c (g, L).
For a given mass term, we first calculate the converged
value at the thermodynamic limit S c (g, L → ∞). The
inverse mass becomes the length scale, which can be used
to perform a finite mass scaling analysis. At the small
mass regime, the corner EE should behave like S c (m) ∼
log(1/m). This is verified in Fig. 6, where the numerical
data shows an accurate finite mass scaling behavior.

The EE correction induced by a small pairing
deformation

In the previous subsection, we have shown that a U (1)
symmetric mass term could contribute to a universal
power-law correction. Here we switch to an s-wave pairing (superconducting) deformation

where g is small. It has the same scaling dimension as the
mass term ∆g = 2. This superconducting term breaks
the global U (1) symmetry and results in a fully gapped
superconductor ground state. The s-wave pairing ensures
a small energy gap opening exactly at the Dirac points.

When g changes sign, the single particle energy band also
inverses, in which the vacuum ground state becomes fully
occupied state. The two phases are related by a canonical transformation. Note that there is no global U (1)
symmetry, the correlation matrix should also include the
correlation function for the annihilation (creation) operators.
We first study the EE correction for the sub-region of
a cylinder geometry. As shown in Fig.7, the correction
term induced by a small pairing deformation shows a
power-law behavior accurately. The exponent is found to
be 1.96, which is again consistent with the scaling form
Ld+z+1−∆g .
Next we consider the sub-region of the square geometry. The numerical results for the Sc is shown in Fig. 8.
It shows a perfect logarithmic scaling behavior. Again,
turning small pairing deformations, one can see there are
deviations from the perfect logarithmic scaling. The correction in the EE induced by the deformation shows an
accurately power-law behavior, see Fig. 8 (b). The exponent is fitted to be δg ∼ 1.94 is again consistent with the
scaling form Eq. 7.

terms of g
S(g, L) ∼ S(0, L) + a1 g Ld+z+1−∆g + O(g 2 )

where S(0, L) ∼ a0 L is the leading area law contribution. This gives rise to the universal power-law correction in Eq. 7. Such a universal correction can be detected
when the length scale is much smaller than the correlation length, L ≪ ξg . It should be noted that this leading
correction relies on a non-zero expansion constant a1 .
The power-law correction shown above may disappear
and the leading correction comes from one order higher
expansion O(g 2 ) when c1 disappears accidentally.
The EE distribution may become more complicated
if the entangling surface contains singular points. It
is known that a singular corner in the sub-region contributes an extra logarithmic divergent term log(L) compared with those with a smooth entangling surface. Thus
when the entangling surface contains corners, one may
rewrite the EE as
S(g, L) = a0 L + ac log(L) + a1 gLd+z+1−∆g + O(g 2 )
(14)
where only leading corrections are considered. There may
exist a power-law correction term from the corner contribution, which has a smaller exponent, hence difficult to
demonstrate in numerical simulations.
Besides critical theories with emergent conformal symmetry, we are also interested in critical points without
emergent Lorentz invariance, z > 1, at the low-energy
limit. We expect the scaling theory, especially the EE
correction in Eqs. 9 and 7 hold when the dynamical exponent is close to that in Lorentz invariant systems z ∼ 1.

Entanglement entropy in critical fermions
without Lorentz invariance

The critical lattice models studied above admit Lorentz
invariance (z = 1) at the low energy. From the scaling argument, this is not a necessary requirement in principle.
For free fermions, a non-integer dynamical exponent is
usually realized in models with long-range hoppings. For
simplicity, here we study critical free lattice fermions with
a dynamical exponent z = 2, whose low-energy modes
read ω ∼ k 2 . Note that the scaling dimension of the
fermionic annihilation operator ψ does not rely on the
value of z. A simple dimension counting gives ∆ψ = 1
for the free fermion in two dimensions. In the following,
we are going to rely on numerical analysis to study the

EE.
We consider the bernal-stacked bi-layer graphene 3
with both intra- (t = 1) and inter-layer (ti ) hoppings.
The model admits two quadratic band touching points
when ti ̸= 0, which results in a dynamical exponent
z = 2 at the low-energy. Deforming the critical model
by adding a staggered mass term m in both layers opens
a small energy gap at the band-touching points. A simple dimensional counting tells that the scaling dimension
of the relevant operator is ∆m = 2. The leading EE
correction is thus expected to be the form of δS ∼ mL3 .
Figure. 9 shows the EE for a given inter-layer hopping
ti = 0.3. It turns out the EE shows similar behavior as
that in the Lorentz invariant theories. The corner contribution S c satisfies a logarithmic scaling for this model.
Turning on the small mass deformation, it becomes deviated from the logarithmic form. Moreover, the leading
correction induced by the small mass deformation is of
a power-law form. However, the exponent is fitted to
be ∼ 3.6, which does not fit in with the scaling form
Ld+z+1−∆m . We also check the power-law correction for
different inter-layer hopping ti . Figure. 10 demonstrates
that S c remains to be a power-law form with the same
exponent. Considering the fact that, the space-time dimension and the dimension of the fermion operators are
all integers, this is a surprising result. The scaling argument does not apply here. In a different model, the free
fermion model on the square lattice with a flux [39, 40],
we find the power-law correction due to the variation of
the flux gives an power-law correction for the EE, which
again can not be explained by the scaling argument.
These results indicate that, small relevant deformations indeed induce a power-law correction term for the
EE in non-Lorentz invariant critical points. However, the
power-law correction term may not be universal in the
sense that its exponent is not determined by the scaling dimension ∆ of the relevant operator in the form
of Ld+z+a−∆ and the exponent may change in different
models. In our studies, the models have a dynamical

7
exponent z = 2, which is a strongly anisotropic critical
point and can be described by the so-called conformal
quantum critical point [41, 42]. The overlap of its ground
state wave function with itself usually results in a partition function of a (1+1)D CFT. The scaling for the corner
EE may be related to that in the (1+1)D CFT [42]. However, the correspondence between the relevant operator
we added in the two-dimensional lattice model and operators in (1+1)D CFT can be complicated. Identifying
the non-trivial correspondence may be helpful to explain
the non-universal exponent in the power-law correction
term.

IV.

SUMMARY

In this paper, we studied the bipartite EE induced by
a small relevant deformation to Lorentz invariant quantum critical points in both one and two dimensions. We
argue that, within the quantum critical region small relevant deformations at the critical point induce a universal
power-law correction to the EE. The exponent for this
term is determined by the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. We applied numerical simulations and
scaling argument to verify the universal correction term.
In one dimension, we used the finite entanglement scaling
to study critical lattice models and confirm the universal
power-law correction to the leading logarithmic scaling
for the EE. In two dimensions, we studied the critical lattice free fermion models which is described by the Dirac
fermion at the low energy. We utilized the correlation
matrix method to calculate the EE. With different types
of relevant deformations, the universal pow-law correction is verified and its exponent is also determined by
the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. We also

studied the corner contribution in the EE. The logarithmic contribution by the singularity point in the entangling surface is confirmed with two different scaling approaches. We also studied non-Lorentz invariant critical
models with a dynamical exponent z = 2. The pow-law
correction for the EE induced by small relevant deformations is also found. However, such a power-law correction
may not be universal.
The models studied here in two dimensions are free
fermion models. We expect the universal power-law correction to hold for non-trivial quantum critical points in
interacting models, where there are anomalous correction
to the dimension of relevant operators. In addition, there
would be shift for the critical point at finite length scales.
We expect there exists a sign change for the EE universal correction term at two different sides of the critical
point. It is also interesting to further study EE in nonLorentz invariant models at the special point z = 2 from
the (1+1)D CFT viewpoint. Another interesting topic
is to study the correction for the EE for critical points
close to the Lorentz invariant point z ∼ 1. We leave these
interesting topics for future studies.
