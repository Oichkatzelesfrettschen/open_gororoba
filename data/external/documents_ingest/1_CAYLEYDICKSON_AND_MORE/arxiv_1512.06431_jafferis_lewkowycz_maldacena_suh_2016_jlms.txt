1    Introduction and summary of results
Recently there has been a great deal of effort in elucidating patterns of entanglement for
theories that have gravity duals. The simplest quantity that can characterize such patterns
is the von Neumann entropy of subregions, sometimes called the “entanglement entropy”.
This quantity is divergent in local quantum field theories, but the divergences are well
understood and one can extract finite quantities. Moreover, one can construct strictly
finite quantities that are well-defined and have no ambiguities. A particularly interesting
quantity is the so called “relative entropy” [1, 2]. This is a measure of distinguishability




                                             1
between two states, a reference “vacuum state” σ and an arbitrary state ρ

                               S(ρ|σ) = T r[ρ log ρ − ρ log σ]                         (1.1)

If we define a modular Hamiltonian K = − log σ, then this can be viewed as the free
energy difference between the state ρ and the “vacuum” σ at temperature β = 1, S(ρ|σ) =
∆K − ∆S.
    Relative entropy has nice positivity and monotonicity properties. It has also played an
important role in formulating a precise version of the Bekenstein bound [3] and arguments
for the second law of black hole thermodynamics [4, 5].
    In some cases the modular hamiltonian has a simple local expression. The simplest
case is the one associatated to Rindler space, where the modular Hamiltonian is simply
given by the boost generator.
    In this article we consider quantum field theories that have a gravity dual. We consider
an arbitrary subregion on the boundary theory R, and a reference state σ, described by
a smooth gravity solution. σ can be the vacuum state, but is also allowed to be any
state described by the bulk gravity theory. We then claim that the modular Hamiltonian
corresponding to this state has a simple bulk expression. It is given by

                                   Areaext
                          Kbdy =           + Kbulk + · · · + o(GN )                    (1.2)
                                    4GN

The first term is the area of the Ryu Takayangi surface S (see figure 1), viewed as an
operator in the semiclassically quantized bulk theory. This term was previously discussed
in [6]. The o(G0N ) term Kbulk is the modular Hamiltonian of the bulk region enclosed
by the Ryu-Takayanagi surface, Rb , when we view the bulk as an ordinary quantum
field theory, with suitable care exercised to treat the quadratic action for the gravitons.
Finally, the dots represent local operators on S, which we will later specify. We see that
the boundary modular Hamiltonian has a simple expression in the bulk. In particular, to
leading order in the 1/GN expansion it is just the area term, which is a very simple local
expression in the bulk. Furthermore, this simple expression is precisely what appears
in the entropy. This modular Hamiltonian makes sense when we compute its action on
bulk field theory states ρ which are related to σ by bulk perturbation theory. Roughly
speaking, we consider a ρ which is obtained from σ by adding or subtracting particles
without generating a large backreaction.
    Due to the form of the modular Hamiltonian (1.2), we obtain a simple result for the
relative entropy
                                   Sbdy (ρ|σ) = Sbulk (ρ|σ)                           (1.3)

where the left hand side is the expression for the relative entropy on the boundary. In
the right hand side we have the relative entropy of the bulk quantum field theory, with ρ


                                              2
and σ in the right hand side, being the bulk states associated to the boundary states ρ, σ
appearing in the left hand side. Note that the area term cancels.
   Another consequence of (1.2) is that the action of Kbdy coincides with the action of
Kbulk in the interior of the entanglement wedge1 ,

                                        [Kbdy , φ] = [Kbulk , φ]                         (1.4)

for φ a local operator in Rb . This follows from causality in bulk perturbation theory: terms
in Kbdy localized on S do not contribute to its action in the interior of the entanglement
wedge, S being space-like to the interior. Note Kbulk is the bulk modular Hamiltonian
associated to a very specific subregion, that bounded by the extremal surface S. Impli-
cations of (1.4) for entanglement wedge reconstruction are described in section 5.2.




Figure 1: The red segment indicates a spatial region, R, of the boundary theory. The
leading contribution to the entanglement entropy is computed by the area of an extremal
surface S that ends at the boundary of region R. This surface divides the bulk into two,
region Rb and its complement. Region Rb lives in the bulk and has one more dimension
than region R. The leading correction to the boundary entanglement entropy is given by
the bulk entanglement entropy between region Rb and the rest of the bulk.


    The bulk dual of relative entropy for subregions with a Killing symmetry was con-
sidered before in [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In particular, in [12], the authors related it to the
classical canonical energy. In fact, we argue below that the bulk modular hamiltonian
is equal to the canonical energy in this case. This result extends that discussion to the
quantum case. Note (1.2) and (1.3) are valid for arbitrary regions, with or without a
Killing symmetry. In addition, we are not restricting σ to be the vacuum state. Recently
a different extension of [12] has been explored in [13], which extends it to situations where
one has a very large deformation relative to the vacuum state. That discussion does not
obviously overlap with ours.
    This paper is organized as follows. In section two, we recall definitions and properties
of entanglement entropy, the modular Hamiltonian, and relative entropy. In section three,

      The entanglement wedge is the domain of dependence of the region Rb .


                                                   3
we present an argument for the gravity dual of the modular hamiltonian and the bulk
expression for relative entropy. In section four, we discuss the case with a U (1) symmetry,
relating to previous work. In section five, we discuss the flow generated by the boundary
modular hamiltonian in the bulk. We close in section six with some discussion and open
questions.


2     Entanglement entropy, the modular hamiltonian,
      and relative entropy
We consider a system that is specified by a density matrix ρ. This can arise in quantum
field theory by taking a global state and reducing it to a subregion R. We can compute the
von Neuman entropy S = −T r[ρ log ρ]. Due to UV divergences this is infinite in quantum
field theory. However, these divergences are typically independent of the particular state
we consider, and when they depend on the state, they do so via the expectation value of
an operator. See [14, 15].


2.1     Modular Hamiltonian
It is often useful to define the modular hamiltonian Kρ ≡ − log ρ. From its definition, it
is not particularly clear why this is useful – it is in general a very non-local complicated
operator. However, for certain symmetric situations it is nice and simple.
    The simplest case is a thermal state where K = H/T , with H the Hamiltonian of the
system. Another case is when the subregion is the Rindler wedge and the state is the
vacuum of Minkowski space, when K is the boost generator. This is a simple integral
of a local operator, the stress tensor. For a spherical region in a conformal field theory,
we have a similarly simple expression, which is obtained from the previous case by a
conformal transformation [16]. In free field theory one can also obtain a relatively simple
expression that is bilocal in the fields [17] for a general subregion of the vacuum state.
    In this paper we consider another case in which simplification occurs. We consider
a quantum system with a gravity dual and a state that can be described by a gravity
solution. We will argue that the modular Hamitonian is given by the area of the Ryu-
Takayanagi minimal surface plus the bulk modular Hamiltonian of the bulk region enclosed
by the Ryu-Takayanagi surface.


2.2     Relative entropy
Modular Hamiltonians also appear in the relative entropy

                      Srel (ρ|σ) = trρ(log ρ − log σ) = ∆hKσ i − ∆S                    (2.5)


                                             4
where Kσ = − log σ is the modular Hamiltonian associated to the state σ. If σ was a
thermal state, the relative entropy would be the free energy difference relative to the
thermal state. As such it should always be positive.
    Relative entropies have a number of interesting properties such as positivity and mono-
tonicity [1]. Moreover, while the entanglement entropy is not well defined for QFT’s,
relative entropies have a precise mathematical definition [2].
    If ρ = σ + δρ, then, because of positivity, the relative entropy is zero to first order in
δρ. This is called the first law of entanglement:

                                            δS = δhKσ i                                         (2.6)

    When we consider a gauge theory, the definition of entanglement entropy is ambiguous.
If we use the lattice definition, there are different operator algebras that can be naturally
associated with a region R [14]. Different choices give different entropies. These algebras
differ in the elements that are kept when splitting space into two, so that ambiguities are
localized on the boundary of the region, ∂R. One natural way of defining the entanglement
entropy is by fixing a set of boundary conditions and summing over all possibilities, since
there is no physical boundary. This was carried out for gauge fields in [18, 19, 51] and gives
the same result as the euclidean prescription of [20]. However, the details involved in the
definition of the subalgebra are localized on the boundary. Because of the monotonicity
of relative entropy, these do not contribute to the relative entropy (see section 6 of [14]
for more details).
    In the case of gravitons we expect that similar results should hold. We expect that
we similarly need to fix some boundary conditions and then sum over these choices. For
example, we could choose to fix the metric fluctuations on the Ryu-Takayanagi surface,
viewing it as a classical variable, and then integrate over it. As argued in [14], we expect
that the detailed choice should not matter when we compute the relative entropy. See
appendix A for more details.
    As we mentioned above, it often occurs that two different possible definitions of the
entropy give results that differ by the expectation value of a local operator, S(ρ) =tr(ρO)+
S̃(ρ). A trivial example is the divergent area term which is just a number. In these cases
the two possible modular Hamiltonians are related by

                            S(ρ) = tr (ρO) + S̃(ρ) −→ K = O + K̃                                (2.7)

This implies that relative entropies are unambiguous, S(ρ|σ) = S̃(ρ|σ). For the equality
of relative entropies, it is not necessary for O to be a state independent operator. It is
only necessary that O is the same operator for the states ρ and σ.2
   2
    In other words, if we consider a family of states, with ρ and σ in that family, then O should be a
state independent operator within that family.

3       Gravity dual of the modular hamiltonian
A leading order holographic prescription for computing entanglement entropy was pro-
posed in [21, 22] and it was extended to the next order in GN in [23] (see also [24]). The
entanglement entropy of a region R is the area of the extremal codimension-two surface
S that asymptotes to the boundary of the region ∂R, plus the bulk von Neuman entropy
of the region enclosed by S, denoted by Rb . See figure 1.

                                         Aext (S)
                           Sbdy (R) =             + Sbulk (Rb ) + SWald−like                         (3.8)
                                          4GN

SWald−like indicates terms which can be written as expectation values of local operators on
S. They arise when we compute quantum corrections [23], we discuss examples below.
    We can extract a modular Hamiltonian from this expression. We consider states that
can be described by quantum field theory in the bulk. We consider a reference state σ,
which could be the vacuum or any other state that has a semiclassical bulk description.
We consider other states ρ which likewise can be viewed as semiclassical states built
around the bulk state for σ. To be concrete we consider the situation where the classical
or quantum fields of ρ are a small perturbation on σ so that the area is only changed by
a small amount. Now the basic and simple observation is that both the area term and
the SWald−like are expectation values of operators in the bulk effective theory. Therefore,
for states that have a bulk effective theory, we can use (2.7) to conclude that

                                           Âext
                                 Kbdy =          + ŜWald−like + Kbulk                               (3.9)
                                           4GN

This includes the contribution from the gravitons, as we will explain in detail below.
The area term was first discussed in [6]. We view the area of the extremal surface as
an operator in the bulk effective theory. This contains both the classical area as well as
any changes in the area that result from the backreaction of quantum effects. Since we
are specifying the surface using the extremality condition, this area is a gauge invariant
observable in the gravity theory.3 Note that the area changes as we change the state,
but we can choose a gauge where the position of the extremal surface is fixed. Finally
ŜWald−like are the operators whose expectation values give us SWald−like .
    Interestingly, all terms that can be written as local operators drop out when we con-
sider the relative entropy. The relative entropy has a very simple expression

                                        Sbdy (ρ|σ) = Sbulk (ρ|σ)                                   (3.10)
    3
     If we merely define a surface by its coordinate location in the background solution, then a pure gauge
fluctuation of the metric can change the area. If the original surface is not extremal this already happens
to first order.




                                                    6
Note that the term going like 1/GN cancels out and we are only left with terms of order
G0N . There could be further corrections proportional to GN which we do not discuss in
this article. It is tempting to speculate that perhaps (3.10) might be true to all orders in
the GN expansion (i.e. to all orders within bulk perturbation theory).
    Of course, using the equation for the entropy (3.8) and (3.9) we can check that the
first law (2.6) is obeyed. In the next section we discuss this in more detail for a spherical
subregion in the vacuum.


4     Regions with a local boundary modular Hamilto-
      nian
For thermal states, Rindler space, or spherical regions of conformal field theories we have
an explicit expression for the boundary modular Hamiltonian. In all these cases there is
a continuation to Euclidean space with a compact euclidean time and a U (1) translation
symmetry along Euclidean time. We also have a corresponding symmetry in Lorentzian
signature generated by a Killing or (conformal Killing) vector ξ. The modular Hamiltonian
                                                             R
is then given in terms of the stress tensor as Kbdy = ER ≡ ∗(ξ.Tbdy ), where the integral
is over a boundary space-like slice. When the theory has a gravity dual, the bulk state σ
is also invariant under a bulk Killing vector ξ. In this subsection we will discuss (3.9) for
states constructed around σ.
    For this discussion it is useful to recall Wald’s treatment of the first law [25, 26, 27]
                                                  Z
                                   Alin (δg)
                             δER =           +        ∗(ξ.Eg (δg))                     (4.11)
                                    4GN           Σ


where Eg (δg) is simply the linearized Einstein tensor with the proper cosmological con-
stant. It is just the variation of the gravitational part of the action and does not include
the matter contribution. Here Alin is the first order variation in the area due to a met-
ric fluctuation δg. And Σ is any Cauchy slice in the entanglement wedge Rb . Equation
(4.11) is a tautology, it arises by integrating by parts the linearized Einstein tensor. It is
linear in δg and we can write it as an operator equation by sending δg → δĝ, where δĝ is
the operator describing small fluctuations in the metric in the semiclassically quantized
theory.


4.1     Linear order in the metric
For clarity we will first ignore dynamical gravitons, and include them later (we would
have nothing extra to include if we were in three bulk dimensions). We consider matter
fields with an o(G0N ) stress tensor in the bulk, assuming the matter stress tensor was zero



                                              7
on the σ background.4 Such matter fields produce a small change in the metric that can
be obtained by linearizing the Einstein equations around the vacuum. These equations
                   mat          mat
say Eg (δg)µν = Tµν    , where Tµν  is the stress tensor of matter. Inserting this in (4.11)
we find that [25, 26, 27]
                                            Z

where we used that the bulk modular Hamiltonian also has a simple local expression in
terms of the stress tensor due to the presence of a Killing vector with the right properties
at the entangling surface S. Notice that we can disregard additive constants in both the
area and E, which are the values for the state σ. We only care about deviations from these
values. This is basically the inverse of the argument in [28]. This shows how (3.9) works
in this symmetric case. The term ŜWald−like in (3.9) arises in some cases as we discuss
below.
    Let us now discuss the ŜWald−like term. There can be different sources for this term. A
simple source is the following. The bulk entanglement entropy has a series of divergences
which include an area term, but also terms with higher powers of the curvature. Depending
on how we extract the divergences we can get certain terms with finite coefficients. Such
terms are included in SWald−like . A different case is that of a scalar field with a coupling
αφ2 (R − R0 ) where R is the Ricci scalar in the bulk, and R0 the Ricci scalar on the
unpertubed background, the one associated to the state σ. Then there exists an additional
                                                      R
term in the entropy of the form ŜWald−like = 2πα S φ2 . If we compute the entropy as
the continuum limit of the one on the lattice, then it will be independent of α. Under
these conditions the bulk modular Hamiltonian is also independent of α and is given
by the canonical stress tensor, involving only first derivatives of the field. However, the
                                      R
combination of Kbulk + ŜWald−like = Σ ∗(ξ.T grav (φ)), where Tµν
                                                                grav
                                                                     (φ) is the standard stress
                                                                                   grav
tensor that would appear in the right hand side of Einstein’s equations. Tµν            (φ) does
depend on α. The α dependent contribution is a total derivative which evaluates to
2παφ2 at the extremal surface. A related discussion in the field theory context appeared
in [15, 29].


4.2      The graviton contribution
We expect that we can view the propagating gravitons as one more field that lives on the
original background, given by the metric gσ . In fact, we can expand Einstein’s equations
                                                          √
in terms of g = gσ + δg2 + h. Here h, which is of order GN , represents the dynamical
graviton field and obeys linearized field equations. δg2 takes into account the effects of
   4
    This discussion can be simply extended when there is a non-zero but U (1)-symmetric background
matter stress tensor, such as in a charged black hole. In that case we need to subtract the background
stress tensor to obtain the bulk modular Hamiltonian.

where Tµν    (h) comes simply from expanding the Einstein tensor (plus the cosmological
constant) to second order and moving the quadratic term in h to the right hand side.
h obeys the homogeneous linearized equation of motion, so the term linear in h in the
equation above vanishes. We can now use equations (44-46) in [30], which imply that

                                               Âlin (h + δg2 ) + Âquad (h)
                        Kbdy,1+2 = E1+2 =                                    + Ecan          (4.14)
                                                           4GN

where Kbdy,1+2 is the boundary modular Hamitonian (or energy conjugate to τ trans-
lations) expanded to quadratic order in fluctuations. Similarly, the area is expanded
to linear and quadratic order. Finally, Ecan is the bulk canonical energy5 defined by
        R
Ecan = ω(h, Lξ h)+matter contribution, where ω is the symplectic form defined in [30].
From this expression we conclude that the modular Hamiltonian is the canonical energy

                                               Kbulk = Ecan                                  (4.15)

    We can make contact with the previous expression (4.12) as follows. If we include
                               mat      mat    grav
the gravitons by replacing Tµν     → Tµν    + Tµν   (h) in (4.12), then we notice that we get
Alin (δg2 ), without the term Aquad (h). However, one can argue that (see eqn. (84) of [30])
                                Z
                                                                    Aquad (h)

thus recovering (4.14).
    In appendix A we discuss in more detail the boundary conditions that are necessary
for quantizing the graviton field.


4.3        Quadratic order for coherent states
The problem of the gravity dual of relative entropy was considered in [12] in the classical
regime for quadratic fluctuations around a background with a local modular Hamiltonian.
They argued that the gravity dual is equal to the canonical energy. Here we rederive their
result from (3.10).
    We simply view a classical background as a coherent state in the quantum theory.
   R
eiλ Πφ̂+φΠ̂ |ψσ i, where |ψσ i is the state associated to σ 6 . We see that in free field theory
we can view coherent states as arising from the action of a product of unitary operators,
  5
      This differs from the integral
                            √        of the gravitational stress tensor by boundary terms.
  6
      Here λ could be O(1/ GN ) as long as the backreaction is small.

one acting inside the region and one ouside. For this reason finite coherent excitations
do not change the bulk von Neuman entropy of subregions, or ∆Sbulk = 0. Thus, the
contribution to the bulk relative entropy comes purely from the bulk Hamiltonian, which
we have argued is equal to canonical energy (4.15) . Therefore, in this situation we recover
the result in [12]

             Sbdy (ρ|σ) = Sbulk (ρ|σ) = ∆Kbulk − ∆Sbulk = ∆Kbulk = Ecanonical        (4.17)


5     Modular flow
The modular hamiltonian generates an automorphism on the operator algebra, the mod-
ular flow. Consider the unitary transformation U (s) = eiKs . Even if the modular hamil-
tonian is not technically an operator in the algebra, the modular flow of an operator,
O(s) ≡ U (s)OU (−s), stays within the algebra. For a generic region, the modular flow
might be complicated, see [31] for some discussion about modular flows for fermions in
1+1 dimensions. However, in our holographic context it can help us understand subregion-
subregion duality. In particular, it can help answer the question of whether the boundary
region R describes the entanglement wedge or only the causal wedge [32, 33, 34, 35]. The
entanglement wedge is the causal domain of the spatial region bounded by the interior of
S.
    From (1.2), we have that
                                    [Kbdy , φ] = [Kbulk , φ]                        (5.18)

where φ is any operator with support only in the interior of the entanglement wedge,
and where on the right-hand side we have suppressed terms subleading in GN . On the
left-hand side terms in Kbdy localized on S have dropped out, similarly as in (3.10). Thus
the boundary modular flow is equal to the bulk modular flow of the entanglement wedge,
the causal wedge does not play any role.
    One may also consider the flow generated by the total modular operator, Kbdy,Total =
Kbdy,R − KbdyR̄ , which should be a smooth operator without any ambiguities. From
our full formula for the bulk dual of the modular Hamiltonian we see that Kbdy,Total =
Kbulk,Total + o(GN ). If the global state is pure, then KTotal annihillates it.


5.1    Smoothness of the full modular Hamiltonian in the bulk
For problems that have a U (1) symmetry, such as thermal states and Rindler or spherical
subregions of CFTs, we know the full boundary modular Hamiltonian E. We can define a
time coordinate τ which is translated by the action of E in the boundary theory. In these
situations the bulk state also has an associated symmetry generated by the Killing vector
ξ. We can choose coordinates so that we extend τ in the bulk and ξ simply translates τ


                                            10
in the bulk. Then the bulk modular Hamiltonian is the bulk operator that performs a
translation of the bulk fields along the bulk τ direction.
    Let us now consider an eternal black hole and the thermofield double state [36]. This
state is invariant under the action of HR − HL . Let us now consider the action of only
the right side boundary Hamiltonian HR 7 . It was argued in [37] that this corresponds
to the same gravity solution but where the origin of the time direction on the right side
is changed. This implies that the Wheeler de Witt patch associated to tL = tR = 0
looks as in figure 2(b), after the action of e−itHR On the other hand, if we consider the
bulk quantum field theory and we act with only the right side bulk modular Hamiltonian
Kbulk,R we would produce a state that is singular at the horizon. By the way, it is precisely
for this reason that algebraic quantum field theorists like to consider the total modular
Hamiltonian instead. It turns out that the change in the bulk state is the same as the
one would obtain if we were quantizing the bulk field theory along a slice which had a
kink as shown in figure 2(b). Interestingly the area term in the full modular Hamiltonian
(3.9) has the effect of producing such a kink. In other words, the area term produces a
shift in the τ coordinate, or a relative boost between the left and right sides [38]. The
action of only the area term or only KBulk,R would lead to a state that is singular at the
horizon, but the combined action of the two produces a smooth state, which is simply the
same bulk geometry but with a relative shift in the identification of the boundary time
coordinates8 .



                                                                                   t

Figure 2: In this figure we are considering the thermofield double state. (a) Acting with
the bulk modular Hamiltonian e−itKbulk,R we get a new state on the horizontal line that
has a singularity at the horizon. (b) The area term introduces a kink, or a relative
boost between the left and right sides. Then the state produced by the full right side
Hamiltonian is non-singular, and locally equal to the vacuum state.



      Let us go back to a general non-U(1) invariant case. Since the bulk modular Hamilto-

nian reduces to the one in the U (1)-symmetric case very near the bulk entangling surface
S, we expect that the action of the full boundary modular Hamiltonian, including the
area term, will not be locally singular in the bulk – though it can be singular from the
boundary point of view due to boundary UV divergences.


5.2       Implications for entanglement wedge reconstruction
One is often interested in defining local bulk operators as smeared operators in the bound-
ary. This operator should be defined order by order in GN over a fixed background and
should be local to the extent allowed by gauge constraints. If we consider a t = 0 slice in
the vacuum state, then we can think of a local bulk operator φ(X) as a smeared integral
of boundary operators [39]
                                           Z
                           φ(X) =                dxd−1 dt G(X|x, t)O(x, t) + o(GN )             (5.19)
                                           bdy


One would like to understand to what extent this φ operator can be localized to a subregion
in the boundary.
    Given a region in the boundary R, we have been associating a corresponding region
in the bulk, the so-called entanglement wedge which is the domain of dependence of Rb ,
D[Rb ]. There is another bulk region one can associate to R, the causal wedge (with space-
like slice RC ) which is the set of all bulk points in causal contact with D[R], [40]. RC is
generically smaller than Rb [41, 35].
    In situations with a U (1) symmetry, such as a thermal state or a Rindler or spherical
subregion of a CFT, we have time-translation symmetry and a local modular Hamilto-
nian that generates translations in the time τ . We can express bulk local operators in
the entanglement wedge (which coincides with the causal wedge) in terms of boundary
operators localized in D[R] [39, 42]9
                          Z                Z
                 φ(X) =         dy   d−1
                                               dτ G0 (X|y, τ )O(y, τ ) + o(GN ) ,     X ∈ Rb    (5.20)
                            R

    A natural proposal for describing operators in that case is that we can replace τ in
(5.20) by the modular parameter s. In other words, we consider modular flows of local
operators on the boundary, defined as OR (x, s) ≡ U (s)OR (x, 0)U −1 (s)
    A simple case in which Rb is larger than RC is the case of two intervals in a 1+1 CFT
such that their total size is larger than half the size of the whole system, see figure 3.
Here, it is less clear how to think about the operators in the entanglement wedge. We
would like to use the previous fact that the modular flow is bulk modular flow to try to
get some insight into this issue.
  9
      It is sometimes necessary to go to Fourier space to make this formula precise [42, 43].



                                                          12
Figure 3: In both figures the region R is the union of the two red intervals and the
Ryu-Takayanagi surface is the dotted black line, while the boundary of RC is the blue
dashed line (color online). In a), the shaded region denotes the defining spatial slice Rb
of the entanglement wedge. In b), the shaded region is the defining spatial slice RC of the
causal wedge. The modular flow of an operator close to the Ryu-Takayanagi surface will
be approximately local, so that φ1 (s) will be almost local and, after some s, it will be in
causal contact with φC1 . This flow takes the operator out of this slice to its past or to its
future. Alternatively, if we consider an operator near the boundary of the causal wedge
φC2 , it is clear that, under modular flow, [φC2 (s), φ2 ] 6= 0.



    The modular flow in the entanglement wedge will be non-local, but highly constrained:
the bulk modular hamiltonian is bilocal in the fields [17]. If we have an operator near the
boundary of the causal wedge and modular evolve it, it will quickly develop a non zero
commutator with a nearby operator which does not lie in the causal wedge. Alternatively,
an operator close to the boundary of the entanglement wedge will have an approximately
local modular flow. It will follow the light rays emanating from the extremal surface and
it can be on causal contact with the operators in the causal wedge. See figure 3.
    So we see that to reconstruct the operator in the interior of the entanglement wedge,
one necessarily needs to understand better the modular flow. It seems natural to con-
jecture that one can generalize (5.20) to two intervals (or general regions) by considering
the modular parameter instead of Rindler time, ie the simplest generalization of the
AdS/Rindler formula which accounts for the non-locality of the modular hamiltonian
would be                     Z     Z
                   φ(X) =       dx dsG00 (X|x, s)O(x, s) ,       X ∈ Rb              (5.21)
                              R
       00
Here G is a function that should be worked out. It will depend on the bilocal kernel that
describes the modular Hamiltonian for free fields [17].
   So we see that to reconstruct the operator in the interior of the entanglement wedge, it

                                             13
is necessary to understand better modular flows in the quantum field theory of the bulk.
To make these comments more precise, a more detailed analysis would be required, which
should include a discussion about gravitational dressing and the constraints. We leave
this to future work.
    Here we have discussed how the operators in the entanglement wedge can be though
of from the boundary perspective. However, note that from (3.9) (and consequently the
formula for the relative entropy), it is clear that one should think of the entanglement
wedge as the only meaningful candidate for the “dual of R”, see also [32]. If we add some
particles to the vacuum in the entanglement wedge Rb (which do not need to be entangled
with R̄b ), the bulk relative entropy will change. According to (1.3), the boundary relative
entropy also changes and, therefore, state is distinguishable from the vacuum, even if we
have only access to R.


6     Comments and discussion
6.1    The relative entropy for coherent states
If we consider coherent states, since their bulk entanglement entropy is not changed, the
relative entropy will just come from the difference in the bulk modular hamiltonian. Since
our formulation is completely general, one could in principle compute it for any reference
region or state and small perturbations over it.
    A particularly simple case would be the relative entropy for an arbitrary subregion
between the vacuum and a coherent state of matter. To second order in the perturbation,
one only needs to work out how the modular hamiltonian for the free fields [17] looks like
for that subregion of AdS, and then evaluate it in the coherent state background.


6.2    Positivity of relative entropy and energy constraints
Our formula (3.10) implies that the energy constraints obtained from the positivity of the
relative entropy can be understood as arising from the fact that the relative entropy has
to be positive in the bulk.


6.3    Higher derivative gravity
Even though we focused on Einstein gravity, our discussion is likely to apply to other
theories of gravity. The modular hamiltonian will likely be that of an operator localized
on the entangling surface plus the bulk modular Hamiltonian in the corresponding en-
tanglement wedge. Thus the relative entropy will be that of the bulk. There could be
subtleties that we have not thought about.



                                            14
6.4    Beyond extremal surfaces
A. Wall proved the second law by using the monotonicity of relative entropy [4, 5]. If we
consider two Cauchy slices Σ0 , Σt>0 outside a black hole, then Srel,t < Srel,0 is enough to
prove the generalized second law. Interestingly, section 3 of [30] shows the “decrease of
canonical energy”: Ecan (t) < Ecan (0). The setup (Cauchy slices) that they both consider
is the same. Due to the connection between relative entropy and canonical energy, [12],
we expect a relation between these two statements. This does not obviously follow from
what we said due to the following reason.
    Here we limited our discussion to the entanglement wedge. In other words, we are
always considering the surface S to be extremal. We expect that the discussion should
generalize to situations where the surface S is along a causal horizon. The question is:
what is the precise boundary dual of the region exterior to such a horizon? Even though
we can think about the bulk computation, we are not sure what boundary computation
it corresponds to. A proposal was made in [44], and perhaps one can understand it in
that context.
    Being able to define relative entropies for regions which are not bounded by minimal
surfaces is also crucial to the interesting proposal in [45] to derive Einstein’s equations
from (a suitable extension to non-extremal surfaces of) the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for
entanglement.


6.5    Distillable entanglement
In the recent papers [46, 47] it was argued that for gauge fields, only the purely quantum
part of the entanglement entropy corresponds to distillable entanglement. The “classical”
piece that cannot be used as a resource corresponds to the shannon entropy of the center
variables of [14]. Our terms local in S are the gravitational analog of this classical piece
and one might expect that a bulk observer with access only to the low-energy effective
field theory can only extract bell pairs from the bulk entanglement. This seems relevant
for the AMPS paradox [48, 49, 50].

A      Subregions of gauge theories
A.1     U(1) gauge theory
The problem of defining the operator algebra of a subregion of a gauge theory was con-
sidered in [14]. It was shown that for a lattice gauge theory there are several possible
definitions of the subalgebra. It was further found that the subalgebra can have a center,
namely some operators that commute with all the other elements of the subalgebra. In
this case we can view the center as classical variables. Calling the classical variables xi ,
then for each value of xi we have a classical probability pi and a density matrix ρi for
each irreducible block. The relative entropy between two states is then
                                                   X
                              S(ρ|σ) = H(p|q) +             pi S(ρi |σi )               (A.22)

where pi , qi are the probabilities of variables xi in the state ρ and σ respectively. H is the
                                                                              P
classical (Shanon) relative entropies of two probability distributions, H = i pi log(pi /qi ).
    In the continuum we expect that the relative entropy is finite and independent of the
microscopic details regarding the precise definition of the algebra [2].
    These microscopic details have a continum counterpart. When we consider a region
R we would like to be able to define a consistent quantum theory within the subregion.
In particular, imagine that we consider all classical solutions restricted to the subregion.
Then we define a presymplectic product between two such solutions, which we will use to
quantize the gauge orbits. This presymplectic product should be gauge invariant so that
it does not depend on the particular representative. Let us consider a free Maxwell field.
The presymplectic product is given by integrating
                                 Z                Z
                        1  2
                   Ω(A , A ) =      ω(A , A ) = (A1 ∧ ∗F 2 − A2 ∧ ∗F 1 )
                                         1   2
                                                                                        (A.23)
                                 Σ                 Σ


where A1 = A1µ dxµ is a gauge field configuration. Here we imagine that both A1 and A2
are solutions to the equations of motion. Σ is any spacelike surface.
    Demanding gauge invariance amounts to the statement
                                                Z
                                 0 = Ω(A, d) =     ∧F                          (A.24)
                                                       ∂Σ

where ∂Σ is the boundary of the spacelike surface. We have used the equations of motion
for F and integrated by parts. In order to make this vanish we need some boundary


                                              16
conditions. In particular, let us concentrate on the boundary conditions required at the
boundary of Σ corresponding to the boundary of a region S = ∂Σ. One possible boundary
condition is to set Ai = Acl                                                cl
                           i for components along the surface, where Ai is a classical gauge
field on the surface. In this case, it is natural to set  = 0 on the surface. We can quantize
the problem for each fixed Acl                                    cl                    cl
                               i and then integrate over all Ai . These values of Ai are the
“center” variables xi in the above discussion. This is called the “magnetic” center, since
                                                         cl
the gauge field Acli defines a magnetic field F = dA on the surface.
    There are other possibilities, such as fixing the electric field, or “electric center”, where
the perpendicular electric field is fixed.
    These would correspond to specific choices on the lattice. Since we expect that relative
entropy is a finite and smooth function of the shape of the region, [14] has shown that the
detailed boundary condition does not matter, as long as we choose something that makes
physical sense. Recently, [18, 19] carried out explicitly the field theory calculation, being
careful with the center variables.


A.2     Gravity
Here we consider the problem of defining a subregion in a theory of Einstein gravity. We
consider only the problem at the quadratic level where we need to consider free gravitons
moving around a fixed background (which obeys Einstein’s equations). These gravitons
can be viewed as a particular example of a gauge theory. We can also compute the
symplectic form, as given in [27], and then impose that the symplectic inner product
between a pure gauge mode and another solution to the linearized equations vanishes.
Here the gauge tranformations are reparametrizations, generated by a vector field ζ.
Note that ζ is not a killing vector, it is a general vector field and it should not be confused
with ξ discussed in section 4. Writing the metric as g + δg, where g is the background
metric and δg is a small fluctuation. Then the gauge tranformation acts as δg → δg +Lζ g,
where Lζ is the Lie derivative. Then, as shown in [30], there is a simple expression for
the sympectic product with a such a pure gauge mode
                            Z                  Z
                               ω(δg, Lζ g) =       δQζ − ζ.Θ(g, δg)                      (A.25)
                             Σ                 ∂Σ


with Qζ and Θ(g, δg) given in eqns (32) and (17) of [30].
    We would like to choose boundary conditions on the surface which make the right
hand side zero. We choose boundary conditions similar to the “magnetic” ones above.
Namely, we fix the metric along the entangling surface S to δgij = γij . We treat γij as
classical and then integrate over it. This is enough to make all terms in (A.25) vanish.
Let us be more explicit. By a change of coordinates we can always set the metric to have
the following form near the entangling surface. For simplicity we write it in Euclidean


                                               17
space, but the same is true in Lorentzian signature

                          ds2 = dρ2 + [ρ2 + o(ρ4 )](dτ + ai dy i )2 + hij dy i dy j             (A.26)

here ai and hij can be functions of τ and ρ, with a regular expansion around ρ = 0. In
these coordinates the extremal surface S is always at ρ = 0, both for the original metric
and the perturbed metric. Extremality implies that the trace of the extrinsic curvature
is zero, or K A = hij ∂X A hij = 0, where X A = (X 1 , X 2 ) = (ρ cos τ, ρ sin τ ). This is true for
the background and the fluctuations

                                          K A = 0,         δK A = 0                             (A.27)

which ensures that even on the perturbed solution we are considering the minimal surface.
These conditions ensure that the splitting between the two regions is defined in a gauge
invariant way.
    We demand that all fluctuations are given in the gauge (A.26). Thus, near ρ = 0, δg
leads to δai and δhij . We now further set a boundary condition that δhij = γij where
γij is a classical function which we will later integrate over. For defining the quantum
problem we will view it as being classical. We will quantize the fields in the subregion for
fixed values of γij and then integrate over the classical values of γij .
    With these boundary conditions we see that all terms in (A.25) vanish. In fact, (A.25),
has three terms10
         Z                  Z
            ω(δh, Lξ g) =       δδh Q(ζ) − iζ Θ(g, δh)
          Σ                  ∂Σ
                            Z                                                      
                                      i   τ    i       ij         1 ij           AB
                         =       δai ζ + ζ δhi + (−h ∂A δhij + δh ∂A hij )ζB         (A.28)
                             ∂Σ                                   2

    Since the fluctuation of the metric is zero at the entangling surface, δhij = 0, we see
that many terms vanish. In addition, since we are setting δhij = 0, it is also natural to
restrict the vector fields so that ζ i = 0 on the surface. This ensures that the first term in
(A.28) vanishes. Note that the middle term is related to the fact that the area generates
a shift in the coordinate τ . After all the area is the Noether charge associated to such
shifts [26, 27].
    The extremality condition makes sure that we are choosing a (generically) unique
surface for each geometry. We then treat the induced geometry on the surface as a
classical variable, quantize the metric in the subregion, and then sum over this classical
variable. In this region, we seem to have a gauge invariant symplectic product.
    We have not explicitly computed the entanglement entropy for gravitons with these
choices, but we expect that it should lead to a well defined problem and that relative
