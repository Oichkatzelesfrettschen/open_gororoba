The universal dependence of hadron suppression, 𝑅AA ( 𝑝 ⊥ ), observed at large-𝑝 ⊥ in heavy ion
collisions at RHIC and LHC allows for a systematic determination of the average parton energy loss
⟨𝜖⟩ in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). A simple relation between ⟨𝜖⟩ and the soft particle multiplicity
allows for probing the dependence of parton energy loss on the medium path-length. We find
that all the available measurements are consistent with ⟨𝜖⟩ ∝ 𝐿 𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02±0.09
, consistent
0.06
with the pQCD expectation of parton energy loss in a longitudinally expanding QGP. We then
show, based on the model predictions, that the data on the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient divided
by the collision eccentricity, 𝑣 2 /e, follows the same scaling property as 𝑅AA . Finally, a linear
relationship between 𝑣 2 /e and the logarithmic derivative of 𝑅AA at large 𝑝 ⊥ offers a purely datadriven access to the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss. Quite remarkably, both hadron and jet
measurements obey this latter relationship, moreover with consistent values of 𝛽. This points to
the same parametric path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in QGP.

Path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss from universal scaling laws

François Arleo

The theory of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its associated jet quenching
phenomenology in heavy ion collisions has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by
precise measurements from RHIC and LHC. Despite these advancements, fundamental questions
remain, such as how parton energy loss in QGP depends on the medium path-length 𝐿. In these
proceedings, we discuss how this question can be addressed through a data-driven strategy. More
specifically, we will exploit the scaling properties of large-𝑝 ⊥ hadron spectra in heavy ion collisions,
predicted by a simple analytic energy loss model and observed in experimental data. In addition, we
show that jet measurements obey one such scaling law, offering the possibility to study jet energy
loss in QGP within the same strategy.
As discussed in Refs. [1, 2], the quenching of hadron spectra, 𝑅AA ( 𝑝 ⊥ ), exhibits at large 𝑝 ⊥ a
universal shape as a function of 𝑝 ⊥ :
ℎ
𝑅AA
( 𝑝 ⊥ , ¯𝜖, 𝑛) ≃ 𝑓 (𝑢 ≡ 𝑝 ⊥ / 𝑛 ¯𝜖).

(1)

ℎ /d𝑝 ∝ 𝑝 −𝑛 ,
Here, 𝑛 represents the spectral index of the hadron 𝑝 ⊥ spectrum in pp collisions, d𝜎pp

⊥
and 𝜖¯ denotes a characteristic energy loss scale reflecting the properties of the medium produced in
a given collision system. Fits to the quenching of hadron spectra, measured in heavy ion collisions
at RHIC (AuAu collisions) and LHC (XeXe, PbPb), allow for a systematic extraction of the scales
√
𝜖¯ across a broad range of collision energies 𝑠 and centrality classes C, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see
Ref. [2] for more details and for the bibliographical references therein to the data sets).
In order to go a step further, it is instructive to relate the 𝜖¯ to the relevant physical quantities in
heavy ion collisions. In the BDMPS formalism, 𝜖¯ should scale according to [2]

𝜖¯ ∝ ⟨𝑧⟩ 𝐶 𝑘 𝑞ˆ 0 𝜏0𝛼 𝐿 2− 𝛼 ,

where ⟨𝑧⟩ is the momentum fraction carried by the hadron, 𝐶 𝑘 is the color charge of the parton 𝑘, 𝐿
is the medium path-length and 𝑞ˆ 0 stands for the transport coefficient at formation time 𝜏0 (𝜏0 ≪ 𝐿).

Since the values of ⟨𝑧⟩ and 𝐶 𝑘 may differ for heavy hadrons, the analysis will focus on light hadrons
from now on. The parameter 𝛼 entering (2) characterizes the dynamical expansion of the medium,
𝑞(𝜏0 ) is proportional to the
according to ˆ
𝑞(𝜏) = 𝑞ˆ 0 (𝜏0 /𝜏) 𝛼 . The initial transport coefficient 𝑞ˆ 0 = ˆ

where 𝐴⊥ is the transverse overlap area of the two crossing nuclei. Plugging (3) in (2) leads to the

with 𝛽 = 2 − 𝛼. The geometric quantities 𝐴⊥ and 𝐿 entering Eq. (4) are determined through an
optical Glauber model, assuming hard sphere nuclear densities. The charged particle multiplicity
data d𝑁ch /d𝜂 at mid-rapidity is taken from PHENIX at RHIC and from ALICE and CMS at LHC
(see [2] and references therein). The energy loss scales 𝜖¯ extracted from the quenching of light
hadrons are fitted using Eq. (4), with 𝛽 (and 𝐾) taken as a free parameter.
As can be seen in Figure 2, the scaling property expected from Eq. (4) holds very well for light

hadron production in all collision systems. The fits leads to 𝛽 = 1.02−0.06
(𝜒2 /ndf = 0.51), where the
uncertainties originate from the fit and from the use of alternative Glauber models [2]. The value
of 𝛽 proves compatible with unity, that is the BDMPS expectation in QGP experiencing a purely
longitudinal expansion (i.e. 𝛼 = 1).

Once the dependence of 𝜖¯ with 𝐿 is empirically determined, it becomes possible to investigate
the azimuthal dependence of hadron suppression, from which the 𝑣 2 coefficient can be computed.
Using the universal shape of 𝑅AA , its 𝜙 dependence can be modeled as

where 𝐿(𝜙) is the path-length as a function of the azimuthal angle 𝜙 (with 𝜙 = 0 being the direction
of the impact parameter), approximated as 𝐿 (𝜙) = 𝐿 × (1 − e cos (2𝜙)), where the eccentricity is
defined as e = (𝐿(𝜋/2) − 𝐿 (0)) /(𝐿 (𝜋/2) + 𝐿(0)). To first order in e and using Eq. (5), the elliptic
flow coefficient can be approximated as [2]

Eq. (6) indicates that 𝑣 2 /e at large 𝑝 ⊥ should exhibit the same approximate universal dependence
on 𝑝 ⊥ /𝑛𝜖¯ as 𝑅AA , for all collision energies and centrality classes. In order to check this prediction,
𝑅AA ( 𝑝 ⊥ , 𝜙) has been computed in each collision system, using our full model including Glauber
simulations; this is then fitted to extract 𝑣 2 values. The model predictions using the 𝛽 value fitted in
Fig. 2 (grey band) and the CMS measurements of 𝑣 2 in PbPb collisions [3, 4] are plotted together
in Fig. 3 as a function of the scaling variable 𝑝 ⊥ /𝑛 ¯𝜖, where the values of 𝜖¯ are determined from the
fits of 𝑅AA (see Fig. 1). The predicted scaling for the different collision systems is clearly apparent
in the data, except at the lowest values of 𝑝 ⊥ /𝑛 ¯𝜖. The simultaneous calculation of 𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 in
the model and its agreement with measurements of both observables is thus compelling – moreover
with a path-length dependence compatible with perturbative QCD. In addition, Eq. (7) indicates
that 𝑣 2 and 𝑅AA at a given 𝑝 ⊥ are trivially related for measurements from the same collision system.
In particular, this relation does not involve the knowledge of the energy loss scale 𝜖¯ nor that of the
function 𝑓 appearing in (6). It is also worth noting that the normalization uncertainties of 𝑅AA
vanish when computing (7). We would like to check whether it also holds when comparing solely
𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 measurements, independently of the present energy loss model. The 𝑣 2 /e measurements
are plotted as a function of the slope d ln 𝑅AA /d ln 𝑝 ⊥ in Fig. 4 (left). The slope is evaluated with
an agnostic fit of CMS 𝑅AA data [5, 6]; when the centrality classes for 𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 did not match,
values for combined classes have been interpolated with weights scaling with 𝑁coll .
Although the present precision of the data does not allow yet for a rigorous test of Eq. (7),
the correlation between the two measured quantities is clearly apparent (correlation coefficient
𝜌 = 0.78). In addition, a fit with the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 reproduces fairly the hadron
observations, resulting in a value 𝛽 = 0.94 ± 0.04 (fit uncertainties only) consistent with the value
+0.09
𝛽 = 1.02−0.06
extracted from the scaling with hadron multiplicity, Eq. (4). This gives confidence
that the relation between 𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 at large 𝑝 ⊥ indeed provides a direct experimental access to
the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in QGP. A possible explanation for the slight
overshoot in the 50–60% centrality class may be back-to-back jet correlations contamination in
data [6]. In other centrality classes, disagreement may be due to the overestimation of e in the
Glauber model presently used, which relies on hard sphere nuclear densities.
Although related in principle, hadron and jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are likely
to probe different aspects of medium-induced gluon radiation. The former appears as a good proxy
of genuine parton energy loss in QGP, the latter probes instead gluon emission off a final state
made of multiple particles acting coherently. Consequently, there is no reason a priori that parton
and jet energy loss exhibit the same energy and path-length parametric dependence, nor the 𝑝 ⊥

Figure 4: Relation between 𝑣 2 /e and d ln 𝑅AA /d ln 𝑝 ⊥ for light hadrons in CMS [3–6] (left) and inclusive jets

determined from the density scaling fit of hadrons of Eq. (4) (grey band, left), and the 𝛽 values extracted
from linear fits of the displayed hadron or jet data (blue bands).

dependence of 𝑅AA of both processes to be identical.1 It is therefore worthwhile to investigate
whether the relation (7) between 𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 , derived on rather general grounds, also applies to jet
production – despite the different 𝑝 ⊥ -dependence of 𝑅AA – and, if so, to determine which value of
𝛽 best matches the data.
√
The results, using 𝑅AA [7] and 𝑣 2 [8] ATLAS data in PbPb collisions at 𝑠 = 5.02 TeV, are
shown in Fig. 4 (right). As for hadrons, the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 fits well the data2, with
a value 𝛽jets = 1.03 ± 0.06 which is consistent with the value extracted from Eq. (4) for light
hadrons. This is a remarkable indication that parton and jet energy loss share the same parametric,
close-to-linear, dependence on the medium path-length. It is also interesting to note that a different
path-length dependence of jet energy loss, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿 0.59 , is obtained in the data-driven approach of
Ref. [11], while other studies point instead towards a stronger dependence on 𝐿, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿 1.4 [12]
and Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿 2 [10].
In summary, relating the values of 𝜖¯ extracted from 𝑅AA to the hadron multiplicity enables the
+0.09
determination of the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss, 𝜖¯ ∝ 𝐿 𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02−0.06
, in agreement
with a longitudinally expanding QGP. The 𝑣 2 /e anisotropy coefficient exhibits the same scaling
property as 𝑅AA , in both the model and data. Finally we highlight a relation between 𝑣 2 /e and
𝑅AA , predicted in the model and observed in data, which allows for a data-driven extraction of the
path-length dependence of parton energy loss. We find that jet data obey the same relation, pointing
to a similar path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in quark-gluon plasma. The LHC
Runs 3 & 4 should allow for testing with unprecedented precision these scaling properties.
1The 𝑅AA and 𝑣 2 of jets have also been discussed at this conference, see Ref. [9, 10] for details.
2The centrality class 0–5% for hadrons and 0–10% for jets have not been included as the small eccentricity results in
large uncertainties on 𝑣 2 /e; in addition, the eccentricity in central collisions depends on density fluctuations that cannot
be accounted for in the optical Glauber model we use to compute it.
