We present the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with the Lyman-α (Lyα) forest
from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey.
Our BAO measurements include both the auto-correlation of the Lyα forest absorption observed
in the spectra of high-redshift quasars and the cross-correlation of the absorption with the quasar
positions. The total sample size is approximately a factor of two larger than the DR1 dataset, with
forest measurements in over 820,000 quasar spectra and the positions of over 1.2 million quasars. We
describe several significant improvements to our analysis in this paper, and two supporting papers
describe improvements to the synthetic datasets that we use for validation and how we identify
damped Lyα absorbers. Our main result is that we have measured the BAO scale with a statistical
precision of 1.1% along and 1.3% transverse to the line of sight, for a combined precision of 0.65%
on the isotropic BAO scale at zeff = 2.33. This excellent precision, combined with recent theoretical
studies of the BAO shift due to nonlinear growth, motivated us to include a systematic error term in
Lyα BAO analysis for the first time. We measure the ratios DH (zeff )/rd = 8.632 ± 0.098 ± 0.026 and
DM (zeff )/rd = 38.99 ± 0.52 ± 0.12, where DH = c/H(z) is the Hubble distance, DM is the transverse
comoving distance, rd is the sound horizon at the drag epoch, and we quote both the statistical and
the theoretical systematic uncertainty. The companion paper presents the BAO measurements at
lower redshifts from the same dataset and the cosmological interpretation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale is one of
the most powerful and well understood tools for studying
the expansion history and geometry of the Universe [e.g.
1]. The BAO scale is due to primordial sound waves that
were frozen into the matter distribution at the epoch of
recombination, and they serve as a standard ruler that
enables precise measurements of cosmic distances relative
to the sound horizon at the drag epoch across a broad
range of redshifts. When combined with observations of
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia
supernovae, BAO measurements provide stringent tests
of the standard cosmological model and its extensions
[e.g. 2–7].
The Lyman-α (Lyα) forest is a unique window into the
high-redshift Universe. Unlike the galaxies and quasars
that are used to trace large-scale structure at lower
redshifts, the Lyα forest is observed as absorption features in the spectra of individual quasars that are produced by relatively low-density gas in the intergalactic
medium [e.g. 8]. The absorption traces large-scale structure through the relative amount of neutral hydrogen gas
at a range of intervening redshifts. The Lyα forest is
unique because each sightline traces the matter distribution over a range of redshifts rather than at a single point, the forest absorbers are relatively less biased
tracers of large scale structure compared to galaxies and
quasars, and the forest samples the matter distribution
over a broader range of spatial scales. These scales range

∗ spokespersons@desi.lbl.gov

from small scales that are dominated by gas pressure to
the large scales that contain the BAO signal [9–11].
The Lyα forest was developed into a tool to measure
the BAO scale in large spectroscopic surveys with measurements of the forest auto-correlation [11] and then the
cross-correlation of the forest with quasars [12] with early
data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
[BOSS, 13], a part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey [SDSS,
14–16]. Subsequent studies with additional data from
BOSS [17–21] obtained the first detections of the BAO
scale. These were followed by additional studies [22, 23]
with data from the extended BOSS [eBOSS, 24] survey
that substantially developed new methodologies for Lyα
forest analysis. These methodologies were needed to account for the dramatic improvements in the statistical
precision of the Lyα BAO measurements as the sample
size grew from 14,000 quasars [11] to several hundred
thousand. The final Lyα sample from eBOSS measured
the Lyα forest auto-correlation with absorption spectra
of over 210,000 quasars at z > 2.1 as well as the crosscorrelation of the forest with the position of over 340,000
quasars at z > 1.77 [25].
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
represents a major step forward in the precise measurement of the BAO scale over a broad redshift range that
includes the Lyα forest [26]. DESI is in the midst of a
survey to measure precise redshifts for over 40 million
galaxies and quasars in just five years, which is an order
of magnitude larger than the final extragalactic sample
from SDSS. This significant increase is possible because
of DESI’s highly efficient, massively multiplexed fiber
spectrograph [27], which was designed to obtain 5000
spectra per observation. The DESI Lyα forest dataset is
already the largest ever obtained. Building on the 88,511

4
quasars [28] in the DESI Early Data Release [29], the
DESI DR1 sample described in [30] was used by [31, hereafter DESI2024-IV ] to analyze over 420,000 Lyα forest
spectra and their correlation with the spatial distribution
of more than 700,000 quasars. In addition to the large
sample, that work presented a number of further analysis improvements. These included a new series of tests of
the analysis methodology prior to unblinding the results,
as well as more tests with synthetic datasets, analysis
of data splits, and tests of the robustness of the BAO
measurements to reasonable alternative analysis choices.
The final result measured DH (zeff )/rd with 2% precision
and DM (zeff )/rd with 2.4% precision at zeff = 2.33.
This paper presents our measurement of the BAO scale
with the first three years of DESI data, which we refer
to as Data Release 2 [DR2 33]. These observations were
obtained between May 2021 and April 2024 and include
over 820,000 Lyα forest spectra and their correlation with
the positions of over 1.2 million quasars. Our results
are part of a comprehensive set of BAO measurements
with the DESI DR2 dataset that span from the local
universe to quasars at z ∼ 4.16. The companion paper
[34] presents the BAO measurements from galaxies and
quasars at z < 2 and our cosmological interpretation of
the measurements in both papers. That analysis includes
constraints on dark energy models and potential extensions to ΛCDM. There are also a series of supporting
papers that provide more information about the analysis
and explore additional implications [35–39].
The structure of this paper is as follows. We start in
Section II with a description of the DESI survey and the
datasets used in our analysis. This includes the most relevant aspects of the spectroscopic analysis and redshift
measurements, the generation of the QSO catalog and
ancillary catalogs that provide information about the locations of Broad Absorption Lines and Damped Lymanα absorption systems that can complicate the analysis,
and the method we use to extract the Lyα forest fluctuations from the spectra. In Section III we present a
brief summary of how we measure the correlations, with
an emphasis on changes from our previous work. The
two largest changes are how we calculate the distortion
matrix and how we model metal-line contamination. We
present our measurements of the correlation function in
Section IV. This includes a discussion of the parameter
choices for our baseline fit to the two-dimensional correlation functions, an analysis of the significance of outliers,
and the systematic error budget. We conducted an extensive series of validation tests prior to unblinding our
results. These tests with both mocks and data are described in Section V. We discuss our results in Section VI,
including in the context of recent theoretical work on the
potential shift of the BAO signal due to the non-linear
growth of structure, as well as previous work. We provide our conclusions in the last section. Two appendices
provide more information about the fit parameters and
additional validation tests.

DATA

DESI was designed to study the nature of dark energy
with the first spectroscopic survey that met the criteria
of a Stage-IV dark energy experiment [40], and to meet
this goal in just five years of observations [26, 41, 42].
The five-year plan is to measure 40 million galaxies and
quasars from the local universe to beyond z ∼ 3.5 over
an area of 14,000 deg2 . This ambitious survey is feasible because the instrument was designed to obtain 5000
spectra per observation, the high throughput of the instrumentation combined with the 4-m aperture of the
Mayall telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory,
and the rapid reconfiguration time of the fiber positioner
system. There is a paper that describes an overview of
the instrumentation and the connection to the science requirements [27]. In addition, there are dedicated papers
on the focal plane system [43], the corrector system [44],
and the fiber system [45].
The DESI targets were selected from the significant
imaging obtained for the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys
[46, 47]. The quasar target selection algorithms are described in several papers [48, 49] that are integrated into
the target selection pipeline [50]. We extensively tested
the DESI survey operations and target selection during
a period of survey validation [51] prior to the start of the
main survey in May 2021. The data from the survey validation period formed the early data release [EDR, 29].
We presented a number of papers at the time of this release that analyzed both the EDR data and the first two
months of the main survey. These included numerous science results related to BAO with galaxies, quasars, and
the Lyα forest [52, 53]. The operation of the survey is
described further in [54].
Observations from the first year of the survey formed
data release 1 [DR1, 30]. That dataset forms the basis for
a series of key science papers that include the measurement and validation of the two-point clustering of galaxies and quasars [55], BAO measurements of these galaxies
and quasars [56] and the Lyα forest (DESI2024-IV), and
the full-shape of correlation functions of the galaxies and
quasars [57]. There are also papers on the cosmological
interpretation of these results, notably one focused on the
BAO measurements [4] and one that adds the full-shape
information [58].
The present paper describes results from the first three
years of the survey, which will be part of the future data
release 2 (DR2). This dataset represents approximately
70% of the complete dark time survey. In addition to the
larger area, the typical quasar in DR2 has 2–3 observations, so the spectral SNR per quasar is higher than in
DR1. Figure 1 shows the DR2 footprint and SDSS DR16
footprint for comparison.
The collaboration plans to release two versions of the
data as part of DR2. The kibo data release that was
used for most of the analysis validation, and the loa
data release, which supercedes kibo, that was used for
the final analysis. The loa release has fixes for software

5
bugs related to weighting in coadded spectra, cosmic ray
masking, and bookkeeping of quasar redshifts between
1.2 < z < 1.8. The main impact is that the redshifts of
about ∼ 0.5% of the quasars with 1.2 < z < 1.8 changed
by more than 100 kms−1 between the two releases.

A.

Spectroscopy

DESI collects spectra with ten identical spectrographs
that record their light from 3600 − 9800 Å in three channels that we refer to as blue, red, and near-infrared.
Each of these channels has a separate diffraction grating, and thus each has a distinct range of resolution.
The blue channel is the most relevant for the Lyα forest and the spectral resolution ranges from approximately 2000 − 3000, while the resolution of the red
and near-infrared channels ranges from 3500 − 4500 and
4000 − 5500, respectively. Figure 2 shows an example
quasar spectrum from DR2.
All of the data collected at the observatory are transferred to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) for processing and subsequent
analysis by collaboration members. The spectra are
processed through a spectroscopic pipeline [59]. This
pipeline extracts the spectrum of each object from the
two-dimensional data, characterizes the noise, subtracts
night sky emission, calculates the wavelength and flux
calibration, and ultimately produces one-dimensional
spectra with a dispersion of 0.8 Å per pixel that include
information about masked pixels, noise, sky lines, and
the spectrograph resolution. All spectra are analyzed
with the Redrock software that fits spectral templates
and measures redshifts [60, 61]. Redrock includes templates for high-redshift quasars [62]. We also analyze
the quasar targets with two additional tools: a Mg II
afterburner [49] that searches for broad Mg II emission
in any quasar target that Redrock classifies as a galaxy,
and QuasarNet, a convolutional neural network quasar
classifier originally developed by [63] and optimized for
DESI spectra [64]. These two tools identify about 10%
more quasars from the quasar targets relative to Redrock,
based on visual inspection during the survey validation
period [65].
DESI prioritizes quasars for the study of the Lyα forest for up to four observations, and the right panel of
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of observations of the quasars in DR2. In addition, some quasars
are observed on multiple nights because a given observation did not achieve the SNR requirement of a single
observation (usually due to worsening conditions). When
we have multiple observations of a given quasar, we coadd
all of the observations to produce the highest SNR spectrum and analyze the coadded spectrum. The coadded
spectra are organized based upon their HEALPix pixel [66]
for our subsequent analysis.

B.

Quasar Catalog

We construct the DESI DR2 quasar catalog in the
same manner as for the DR1 catalog described in
DESI2024-IV. Some of the key properties of the catalog
are that it contains all of the quasars identified by the
three classifiers that have no issues based on the spectroscopic pipeline, with the exception of a low ∆χ2 flag that
is not relevant for quasars. This corresponds to retaining
quasars with only ZWARN=0 and ZWARN=4. The completeness and purity should similarly surpass 95% and 98%,
respectively [62], the statistical precision of the redshift
measurements should be greater than 150 km s−1 , and
the catastrophic failure rate should be about 2.5% (4%)
for redshift errors greater than 3000 (1000) km s−1 . The
DR2 catalog has 1,289,874 quasars with z > 1.77 (which
could contribute to the Lyα quasar cross-correlation) and
824,989 with z > 2.09 (with a Lyα forest that could contribute to the correlations given our selection criteria).

C.

Ancillary Catalogs

We assemble two ancillary catalogs before we measure
the Lyα forest. Damped Lyα absorption (DLA) systems
pose a particular challenge to Lyα forest analysis and we
identify, catalog, and mask DLAs to mitigate their impact. DLAs are important because these systems with
neutral hydrogen column densities NHI > 2 × 1020 cm−2
have damping wings that can extend for thousands of
km s−1 and thus impact the continuum level1 . They are
also more strongly clustered than the Lyα forest [67],
which would complicate the model of the correlations.
DLAs can consequently compromise a significant fraction of the Lyα forest for distinct objects, and do so with
a distinct clustering signature [68]. For DR2, we developed a new template-based approach to identify DLAs
and measure their column density and redshift [36]. That
paper also presents the results from running previouslydeveloped codes based on CNN [69] and Gaussian Process
[70] methods, and describes how we combined measurements from all three algorithms to construct our DLA
catalog. We refer to the supporting paper on DLAs [36]
for the details of how we constructed the DLA catalog for
the DR2 analysis and to the supporting paper on mocks
[37] for a study that shows how several alternative, reasonable choices of catalog combinations have a negligible
impact on our measurements of the BAO parameters.
Broad absorption line (BAL) quasars have absorption
troughs associated with many emission features, including a number that are within the range of the Lyα forest analysis [71]. These features add absorption that is
unrelated to the matter distribution in the intergalactic
medium. In addition, the absorption of bright quasar

FIG. 2. Quasar at z = 3.20 from the DESI DR2 dataset (TargetID = 39627696665266273). The spectrum shows both regions
where we measure the Lyα forest: Region A (indigo) extends from 1040 – 1205 Å in the quasar rest frame and region B (purple)
extends from 920 – 1020 Å. We measure Lyα in both regions. The C IV and C III regions are highlighted in various shades
of green. While there is almost no C III absorption, the C IV absorption spans leftward of the C IV doublet and thus is a
contaminant in both region A and B of the Lyα forest. This is an atypically high SNR spectrum and we have smoothed it
to better illustrate the quasar spectrum and the forest absorption. This quasar contains a DLA with log10 NHI = 20.55 at
z = 2.93.

emission lines produces redshift errors [72, 73]. We identify BALs in 20.5% of quasars in the redshift range
1.77 < z < 3.8 that is used for Lyα forest analysis and
17.1% over the redshift range 1.57 < z < 5 where we can
measure C IV BALs in DESI data. These percentages

are slightly higher than in DR1 (19.8%, 15.7%), which we
attribute to the higher average SNR of the DR2 quasar
spectra. As for DR1, we use the C IV absorption trough
locations to identify and mask the expected locations of
BAL troughs associated with other emission lines that

7
fall within the Lyα forest. One of the DESI DR1 supporting papers [74] describes the method in detail as well
as demonstrate the minimal impact of incompleteness in
the BAL catalog on the BAO measurements.

D.

We measure flux decrements in the wavelength range
3600 - 5772 Å in the observed frame to study the fluctuations due to the Lyα forest. The lower bound is set
by the minimum design wavelength of the spectrographs
and the upper bound corresponds to the middle of the
transition region between the blue and red channels that
is set by the red dichroic. We measure the forest in two
different regions of the quasar rest-frame spectrum, the
Lyα absorption in Region B or Lyα (B): 920 - 1020 Å,
and the Lyα absorption in Region A or Lyα (A): 1040 1205 Å. Measurements in the B region are generally lower
SNR than those in the A region as the B region is only
visible in the highest redshift quasar spectra, which are
on average fainter, and this region also contains absorption from higher-order Lyman series lines. We therefore
compute separate correlations with the A and B regions.
Both of these regions are shown on an illustrative quasar
spectrum in Figure 2. That figure also has a label adjacent to the C III emission line of the region from 1600 1850 Å that we use to quantify spectro-photometric calibration errors.
We produce Lyα forest measurements with the same
method described in DESI2024-IV. Very briefly, we start
with the application of four masks that remove bad pixels
and astrophysical contaminants. These include cosmic
rays, the expected locations of BALs, and the cores of
DLAs. We then discard forests that are less than 120 Å
wide in order to have a sufficient path length to fit a
model to the continuum. Lastly, we calculate the mean
transmitted flux fraction in the C III region in order to
derive a small correction to the spectro-photometric calibration (peaking at 5% at 3650Å) and instrumental noise
estimates (with a 1.5% correction to the noise variance).
All of our subsequent analysis uses the transmitted flux
field δq (λ), where q is index for a given quasar. This is
the ratio of the observed flux to the expected flux minus
one:
fq (λ)
−1 ,
F (λ) Cq (λ)

(2)

We solve for C(λrf ), aq , and bq with the maximum likelihood method. This fit also takes into account the pipeline
noise, which is corrected to account for small calibration
errors, and the intrinsic variance in the Lyα forest.

where F (λ) is the mean transmission, Cq is the unabsorbed quasar continuum, and q is a given quasar. The
procedure to estimate the unabsorbed continuum is described in detail in [28]. This assumes that the product F Cq (λ) for a given quasar is a universal function
of the rest-frame wavelength C (λrf ), although corrected
by a first degree polynomial in Λ ≡ log λ to account for
quasar luminosity and spectral diversity and the redshift

III.

CORRELATIONS

We measure four correlation functions using the quasar
catalog and the δq field described in the previous section:
the auto-correlation of the Lyα forest from region A,
hereafter Lyα(A)×Lyα(A), the auto-correlation of Lyα
absorption between regions A and B, Lyα(A)×Lyα(B),
and the cross-correlations of Lyα from regions A and
B with quasars, Lyα(A)×QSO and Lyα(B)×QSO. We
employ a rectangular grid of comoving separation along
and across the line of sight (r∥ and r⊥ ) and use the
fiducial cosmology defined in Table I to convert angles
and redshifts to comoving separations. The bin size is
4 h−1 Mpc, and the measurements extend to separations
of 200 h−1 Mpc. The data vector size is 2,500 (50 × 50
bins) for Lyα(A)×Lyα(A) and Lyα(A)×Lyα(B), and
twice as large for Lyα(A)×QSO and Lyα(B)×QSO because we consider both negative and positive longitudinal separations, where a negative separation is where the
quasar is behind the forest pixel. The full data vector
size is 15,000 elements.
The measured correlations are shown in Figure 3 and
Figure 4. We compute these correlations with the same
method we used for the DESI DR1 analysis presented in
DESI2024-IV, building on earlier work from BOSS and
eBOSS [21, 25]. As in DESI2024-IV, we present the data
in the form of wedges, which means we show the mean
2 1/2
correlation in bins of separation r = (r∥2 + r⊥
)
and in
intervals of the cosine between the line of sight and the
separation vector µ = r∥ /r. We emphasize that we fit the
2D data (described in Section IV) and these wedges are
just shown for illustrative purposes. DESI2024-IV (and
references therein) contains a more complete description
of the correlation function estimators and the measurement of the full covariance matrix. The only changes to
the analysis for DR2 are improvements in the computation of the distortion matrix and a minor change to the
computation of the metal matrices. We describe these
changes in the following subsections.

A.

Distortion Matrix

The continuum fitting procedure introduces a distortion of the measured Lyα fluctuation field [11]. This is
because it effectively subtracts the mean δ and the first
moment of each forest. The distortion is equivalent to

We improve the modeling of the distortion in this paper by accounting for the redshift evolution of the clustering. We approximate the evolution of the clustering
amplitude with redshift with a power-law of (1 + z), so
the expectation value of the Lyα auto-correlation is:

ηik are given in Eq. 3.3 of DESI2024-IV. We perform
the same operation on the model correlation function,
which is done with the distortion matrix defined below.

Our new approach with the redshift evolution in the

modeled as the average value of the undistorted correlation function ξ in the separation bin N . We thereby
obtain a linear relation between the distorted and undistorted correlation function and the coefficients of this linear relation are the distortion matrix elements [21]. Note
that the comoving separation bin size of the model is
2 h−1 Mpc, which is a factor of two smaller than we use

B.

Modeling Metals

The absorption we observe at a given wavelength in the
Lyα forest includes contributions from several absorbers
with different atomic transitions located at different redshifts along the line of sight (see [53] and DESI2024-IV
for more details). In the correlations of the Lyα forest,
we primarily detect contamination from Si II and Si III
lines, along with more minor contamination from other
foreground absorbers (principally C IV).
There is a true comoving separation vector rti,j at the
true transition wavelengths for each pair of atomic transitions and for each measured pair δi δj (with two observed

wavelengths and a separation angle), as well as a comoving separation rα
i,j based on the assumption that both
absorption features are from the Lyα transition. This difference between true and assumed comoving separation
results in spurious correlations [e.g. 21]. For instance,
at the effective redshift of our observations (zeff = 2.33)
and for our choice of fiducial cosmology (see Table I),
the correlation between Lyα absorption and four Silicon
lines: Si III at 1207 Å and Si II at 1190 Å 1193 Å and
1260 Å, result in spurious peaks in the measured correlation functions at |∆r∥ | ∼ 21, 59, 52 and 104 h−1 Mpc,
respectively. These metal lines are prominent in stacked
spectra centered on strong absorbers [76].
We estimate the contribution from metals by looping
over all possible pairs that contribute to the measured
correlation function and compute the relative weight of
pairs with rti,j ∈ B among those with rα
i,j ∈ A, where A
and B are separation bins. Those weights define what
we call the metal matrix. We use the elements MAB of
this matrix to model the observed correlation
function.

In DESI2024-IV, we estimated the metal matrix along
r∥ only and ignored the small variation in r⊥ . For that
calculation we used the stack of weights as a function
of wavelength. We improve on that approach in this
work by also evaluating the variation as a function of
r⊥ . Now we loop over pairs of wavelengths using the
same stack of weights and we integrate over a suitable
range of possible separation angles in order to get a repα
t
resentative weighted sample of pairs of r⊥
and r⊥
, which
we use to obtain a better estimate of the metal matrix
elements. The end result is two matrices, one that addresses the dependence on r∥ and one that addresses the
dependence on r⊥ . We use both to compute the contribution of metals to the measured correlation function.
This modification is more accurate than the one used
in DESI2024-IV, although the improvement has a very
small impact on the model. The change in χ2 is smaller
than one for more than 9000 degrees of freedom in the fit
of the DESI2024-IV correlation functions, and the change
in the BAO parameters is less than 0.1%.

IV.

MEASUREMENT

We measure the BAO scale with the same procedure
as described in DESI2024-IV. A key aspect of this procedure is that we use the Vega package2 to model the
correlations and for the parameter inference. The model
for the correlations includes the large-scale power spectrum of fluctuations in the Lyα forest that separates
the peak (BAO) and smooth components, redshift evolution, and the distortion matrix due to continuum fitting.

2 https://github.com/andreicuceu/vega

One significant improvement is that the distortion matrix
now accounts for redshift evolution, as described in Section III A. The model also includes contamination from
metal absorption in the IGM, correlated noise due to data
processing, high column density (HCD) systems, quasar
redshift errors, the proximity effect due to the impact
of quasar radiation on the IGM, and small scale correlations such as due to non-linear peculiar velocities. We
sample a Gaussian likelihood with the Nested Sampler
Polychord3 [77, 78]. The baseline fit is described next
in Section IV A. While the quality of the fit is formally
very good, there are numerous outliers that are apparent from careful inspection of the projections shown in
Figure 3 and Figure 4. These outliers are difficult to interpret in isolation because of these are just projections
of the 2D fits and there are correlations between the bins.
We present a detailed analysis of the significance of outliers in Section IV B.
A.

Baseline Fit

The four correlations are:
Lyα(A)×Lyα(A),
Lyα(A)×Lyα(B), Lyα(A)×QSO, Lyα(B)×QSO (see
Section III). The two auto-correlation functions each
have 2,500 data points and the two cross-correlations
each have 5,000 data points, for a total of 15,000 data
points. We also have a 15, 000 × 15, 000 covariance matrix that accounts for the small cross-covariance between
these four correlation functions. We fit these correlations
over the range 30 < r < 180 h−1 Mpc, which is a somewhat narrower range than the 10 < r < 180 h−1 Mpc
range used in DESI2024-IV. The reason for the smaller
fit range is because the model is not a good fit at smaller
scales, which are hard to model well. This reduces the
total number of data points in the fit to 9306.
We fit these data points with the two BAO parameters
α∥ and α⊥ and 15 nuisance parameters, or 17 parameters total. The nuisance parameters include the bias and
redshift space distortion (RSD) parameters for the Lyα
forest, bias parameters for the quasars and for five metal
lines in the forest, bias and RSD parameters for high column density systems (HCDs), a size scale parameter for
HCDs, a potential shift in the cross-correlation function,
redshift errors, the quasar transverse proximity effect,
and a term that accounts for correlated noise in data
processing. We added new, informative priors on several
of the nuisance parameters due to the change in the fit
range.
The best fit values of the BAO parameters are:
α∥ = 1.002 ± 0.011

We provide further information about the nuisance parameters in Appendix A and the values from our baseline
fit are listed there in Table II, along with separate measurements from just the two auto-correlations and just
the two cross-correlations. Section V B discusses the excellent agreement between the auto- and cross-correlation
measurements and the impact of changes to the fitting
process on the BAO measurements.

B.

Goodness of fit

In spite of the quality of the χ2 for the baseline fit,
the wedges in Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that the
best fit model does not go through all of the points.
There is a slight mismatch in the broadband part of the
Lyα(A)×Lyα(A) and Lyα(A)×Lyα(B) correlation functions at separations r between 30 and 80 h−1 Mpc and
µ < 0.95, where the best fit model lies above the data
points on average. We suspect that this is caused by an
imperfect modeling of the correlations at smaller separations (< 30 h−1 Mpc) that affect the larger separations
because of the distortion induced by the continuum fitting. We plan to investigate the impact of continuum

fitting in upcoming analyses thanks in particular to recent improvements in the continuum prediction from the
red side of the quasar spectra [79] that are not affected
by these distortions. For now, we resort to verifying that
this imperfect modeling does not bias the BAO measurements by adding polynomial corrections to the model [as
in 21, 25, 31], which are shown with the dashed curves in
Figure 3 and Figure 4. These corrections add Legendre
polynomials LJ (µ) with order j = 0, 2, 4, 6 divided by
powers of ri with i = 0, 1, 2 to each correlation function.
There are thus 12 additional parameters for each correlation function, or 48 total. This variation provides a visually better fit to the data and the χ2 is also somewhat better: χ2 /(Ndata − Nparam ) = 9243.6/(9306 − 53) = 0.999
with a p-value of 0.53. There is not a large improvement
in the reduced χ2 , although some of the polynomial coefficients do deviate significantly from zero with more than
3 σ significance. We show in Section V B that the polynomial corrections have a negligible effect on the BAO
measurement.
In addition to this imperfect modeling of the distorted
continuum, there is also an apparent mismatch between
the measured and best fit BAO peak position in the
Lyα(A)×Lyα(A) correlation function (top panel of Figure 3) for the wedge 0.80 < µ < 0.95. We interpret this
mismatch as a statistical fluctuation because the best fit
BAO peak position is constrained by the ensemble of the
data and not just this wedge. We have verified this interpretation with independent fits of the BAO peak in each
of the four wedges of the Lyα(A)×Lyα(A) correlation
function shown in Figure 3. While the best fit BAO peak
position is shifted to larger values for the 0.80 < µ < 0.95
wedge, it is compensated by a shift of the best fit BAO
peak position toward lower values for the µ > 0.95 wedge.
We also note that the results from each of the four wedges
are statistically consistent with one another, and we have
verified that this mismatch cannot be explained by a fitter convergence issue (including with extensive tests of
the fitter on synthetic data, see Section V A).
We next explore the possibility of an unidentified contamination of the signal with an inspection of the fit
residuals and their statistical significance in 2D. Figure 6
shows the normalized residuals in the 2D plane of comoving coordinates r∥ and r⊥ for the four correlation
functions: (ξD −ξM )/σξ , where ξD is the measured correlation, ξM is the best fit model, and σξ is the uncertainty
of each element in the correlation function (i.e. square
root of the diagonal of the covariance matrix). There
is a slight excess correlation in the Lyα auto-correlation
along a line at r⊥ ∼ 50 h−1 Mpc, and extended over the
range 100 h−1 Mpc < r∥ < 140 h−1 Mpc where the bin
values are individually not significant (2-σ excess on average). We note that our measurements naturally result
in extended correlations along r∥ due to imperfections in
the continuum fitting. Rejecting the quasar lines of sight
with the largest deviations in flux decrement does not
change this pattern significantly, so it is not caused by a
subset of the data that we could easily isolate. For those

reasons, we consider that this structured excess in the
residuals is consistent with a statistical fluctuation.
It is difficult in general to evaluate the agreement between the data and the model from visual inspection of
the wedge plots because of the large covariance between
neighboring data points: a statistical fluctuation will always look like a bump or a dip extended over several separation bins. In order to help visualize this covariance,
Figure 7 shows the Lyα×Lyα wedges with several curves
that illustrate the best fit model with additive random
realizations of the measurement noise. Those realizations
are obtained with a bootstrap technique: each realization
is based on a different stack of HEALPix pixels, drawn
randomly (with replacement) from the list used to compute the correlation function of the data. A number of
these realizations appear to have larger outliers than the
data.
It is also not unlikely to get a large outlier by chance
given the large number of points shown in the plots
(the famous look-elsewhere effect). Quantitatively, we
find worse outliers in 15% of random realizations of the
Lyα(A)×Lyα(A) correlation function wedges compared
to the data (and similarly 44%, 65% and 11% worse
outliers in random realizations of the Lyα(A)×Lyα(B),

model.

VALIDATION

Most of the methodology for measuring BAO with the
Lyα forest was carefully developed and validated over
many years with applications to many data releases of
SDSS and most recently the analysis of the DESI DR1
dataset (DESI2024-IV). Yet as the Lyα forest dataset
for DESI DR2 is significantly larger than for DESI DR1,
and we have also improved the analysis in a number of
ways, we validate the methodology relative to the greater
statistical precision we expect from DR2 with synthetic
and real data. Before we ran analysis tests on data,
we blinded our measurements of the correlation function
with the same approach we applied for DR1, although
with different shifts. We required that all analysis variations should produce shifts smaller than σ/3 of the statistical uncertainty (accounting for the correlation between
α∥ and α⊥ ), or that we should understand the reason for
any shift (e.g. significant sample size variations). We also
ran extensive tests on synthetic datasets with the requirement that the analysis on the mocks produce results that
are unbiased by less than this same σ/3 threshold. Any
larger shift that we could not explain would be added to
our error budget as a systematic uncertainty.
The first subsection below describes our tests with synthetic data. Many of these tests were conducted with new
synthetic datasets that are described in detail in the supporting paper on mocks [37]. At the time of unblinding
in December 2024, we did appear to have a systematic
bias of order σ/3 in the measurement of synthetic data,

Our validation process with synthetic data largely parallels the extensive work for DR1 [80]. That Lyα BAO
measurement was validated with a total of 150 synthetic realizations (or mocks): 100 realizations of the
LyaCoLoRe mocks [81, 82] and 50 realizations of the
Saclay mocks [83]. These mocks matched the bias evolution of the forest, the angular, redshift, and magnitude
distribution of quasars in DESI DR1, and included different types of astrophysical contaminants, such as metal
absorbers, BAL quasars, and DLAs [84].
We extended that work to DR2 with improved mock
datasets, a larger number of mocks, and more validation tests. These are all described in the companion paper [37]. One significant change is that we have doubled the number of Saclay mocks, from 50 to 100. The
second significant change is that we have improved the
mocks based on LyaCoLoRe in order to have more realistic quasar clustering on small scales and to simulate the
broadening of the BAO feature caused by the non-linear
growth of structure. We have generated 300 of these new
mocks, and we refer to them as the quasi-linear mocks,
or CoLoRe-QL for short.
Figure 8 shows the average measurement (or stack)
of the Lyα auto-correlation from 300 new CoLoRe-QL
mocks, compared to the best-fit model when fitting the
correlations from 10 h−1 Mpc to 180 h−1 Mpc (solid
lines). As discussed in the previous sections, in our
baseline analysis we fit only separations larger than
30 h−1 Mpc, but this figure shows that the new method
to estimate the distortion matrix (introduced in Section III A) results in a good fit even on smaller scales.
For comparison, the best-fit model with the previous distortion matrix is shown in dashed lines.
In Figure 9 we show BAO results from the fit of the
four stacked correlation functions from 300 CoLoRe-QL
mocks (top), and the stack of correlation functions from
100 Saclay mocks (bottom). In this analysis we have
used the same cosmology that was used to generate the
mocks, and since these are log-normal mocks (without
non-linearities or bulk flows), the true BAO parameters
should be α⊥ = α∥ = 1. However, it is clear that our
baseline analysis (filled green contours) has a small but
significant bias in α∥ of order 0.5%. This bias was already
identified in the validation of DESI DR1 with mocks [80],
although it is more statistically significant now due to
the larger statistical power of DESI DR2 and the larger
number of mocks in our current study.

although after unblinding we traced this systematic bias
to the implementation of redshift errors in the synthetic
data and were able to decrease the bias to substantially
below our threshold. In Section V B we present a subset
of the tests on the blinded data. We did many additional
tests that are described in Appendix B. These repeat
most of the tests we performed for DR1 [31].

(top) and cross-correlation (bottom) from 300 CoLoRe-QL
mocks (dots), compared to the best-fit model using the previous (dashed) and the improved (solid) calculations of the
distortion matrix (DM). The shaded areas around the solid
line indicate the errorbars from the DESI-DR2 measurements,
and the gray shaded areas highlight the scales not included
in the fit (the fit to observations starts at 30 h−1 Mpc).

As discussed in [37], the bias is caused by spurious correlations that arise due to quasar redshift errors which
produce a smearing effect during the continuum fitting
process. As part of this process, we compute a mean
quasar continuum, which actually includes numerous,
weak, broad emission lines that are present in the forest
region. Redshift errors smear these emission lines, and
the resulting systematic errors in the mean continuum
give rise to spurious correlations. This effect was first
discussed in [85], and is present in both the Lyα autocorrelations and Lyα-quasar cross-correlations. When
redshift errors are only added to the mocks after continuum fitting, the bias is significantly reduced (see the
empty contours in Figure 9).
In practice, the impact of the spurious correlations is
somewhere in between the baseline and “No σz ” results
shown in Figure 9. This is because the implementation
of redshift errors in the mocks assumes that the Doppler
shifts of the emission lines in the forest region are un-

this contamination. This test relies on the fact that for
quasar-pixel pairs, the contamination is strongly dependent on the small-scale correlation between the quasar
and the host quasar of the forest which contains the pixel
[as shown by 85], while for pixel-pixel pairs it depends on
the small-scale cross-correlation between the host quasar
of one of the pixels and the other pixel [as shown by
86]. Therefore, discarding these close pairs would remove
most of the spurious correlation, while having a minimal
impact on our statistical uncertainty due to the sparsity
of quasars. This is confirmed in [37], which shows that
discarding very close pairs significantly reduces the bias
in the BAO constraint when the mean continuum is affected by redshift errors. This is also shown with the
orange contours in Figure 9. We have also performed the
same test on the data, and found the impact on BAO is
well within our σ/3 threshold, which demonstrates that
the spurious correlations caused by redshift errors do not
have a significant impact on our measurement (see Section V B).
Finally, in [37] we show that the distribution of best-fit
BAO values from each individual mock is consistent with
the reported uncertainties, and that these uncertainties
are similar to the ones obtained in DESI DR2. In particular, the new CoLoRe-QL mocks now produce more realistic BAO uncertainties compared to the mocks used
for DESI DR1. The mock uncertainties are now consistent with the uncertainty measured from the data, due
to the use of an input power spectrum with a smoother
BAO peak, which mimics the non-linear broadening of
the peak [see Figure 9 of 37].

FIG. 9. BAO fits from the stack of 300 CoLoRe-QL mocks

bias when redshift errors are introduced before continuum fitting. The bias is significantly smaller when redshift errors are
added after continuum fitting (empty contours) or when we

correlated with the Doppler shifts of the broad emission
lines at longer wavelengths, which are used to measure
the quasar redshifts. Quasar redshifts are well known
to have more dispersion than galaxy redshifts, and there
are clear systematic errors when redshifts are measured
from higher-ionization species like C IV at longer wavelengths than the quasars Lyα emission line. However, if
these redshift errors are correlated with the forest region,
then the resulting spurious correlations will be overestimated. Therefore, our baseline mock results include the
most extreme version of this effect.
Recently, [86] introduced a test to gauge the impact of

Validation with blinded data

The validation tests with the DESI DR2 data take two
forms. The first are “data splits”, where the dataset is
split into two, and the second are “alternative analyses”,
where we explore how various changes in the methodology impact the BAO results. We performed and passed
these tests before we unblinded with the internal data release called kibo and then reran the data validation tests
after unblinding on a new internal data release called loa.
The differences between these two internal data releases
are quite minor (see Section II), and the differences between the pre- and post-unblinding tests results are negligible.
Figure 10 shows the robustness of our BAO measurement for four data splits. The most significant test is
shown in the top panel. This compares the BAO measurements from just the auto-correlation function with
just the cross-correlation function. These results agree
with each other very well, and also with the combined
result for DESI DR2. The separate BAO measurements
from these two alternatives are listed in Table II. The
second panel also splits the four correlation functions in
two with a comparison of the correlations that just include Region A (Lyα(A)×Lyα(A), Lyα(A)×QSO) com-

(Lyα(A)×Lyα(B), Lyα(B)×QSO). This data split also
demonstrates good consistency, as well as illustrates the
much greater statistical power of Region A relative to
Region B.
The two lower panels show tests where we have split
the quasar catalog into two, and we have done end-toend analyses to each subset independently. The third
panel separates quasars targeted using the Bok and MzLS
surveys (North, declination δ > 32.375◦ ) vs. those targeted DECam data (South). The bottom panel shows
quasars with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR > 4.25) vs.
low SNR4 . We chose this SNR split to achieve approximately equivalent uncertainties in the BAO measurement between the two samples, and not equal numbers
of Lyα forests. Since the SNR criterion only impacts the
forest calculation, the quasars for the cross-correlation
measurement were randomly assigned to one of the two
samples. The BAO scale parameters are statistically consistent for these two data splits as well.

wavelength range 1420 < λrest < 1480 Å.

17
We have recomputed the BAO measurements with a
large number of alternative analysis choices, and the vast
majority were previously performed in DESI2024-IV for
DR1. Our standard to compute an analysis alternative
was that it be a reasonable alternative to our baseline
choice. Figure 11 shows the change in α∥ , α⊥ for four of
these variations, along with the 1σ (red) and σ/3 (gray)
contours from the baseline DR2 analysis for reference.
The blue ellipse and filled circle shows the change when
we rerun with the DR1 analysis configuration. This is
a key test that demonstrates that the analysis changes
described in Section IV do not change the BAO measurements, although they do improve the fit to the correlation
function. The DR1 configuration includes scales as small
as rmin = 10 h−1 Mpc, rather than rm in = 30 h−1 Mpc
for the DR2 baseline. The variation labeled BB represents the BAO measurement if we include a broadband
polynomial as part of the fit as in DESI2024-IV. The fit
with the BB is shown as the dashed lines in Figure 3 and
Figure 4. The third shows the change in the BAO measurement if we eliminate the close pairs discussed in Section V A (angular separations less than θ < 20 arcminutes
and velocity differences of v < 4000 km s−1 ). Elimination
of these close quasar–pixel pairs substantially mitigates
a bias in the mocks that is discussed in Section V A and
a supporting paper [37]. The final variation shows the
change if we fit for the amount of non-linear broadening
of the BAO peak to our fit, instead of fixing it to the prediction from Lagrangian Perturbation Theory as done in
DESI2024-IV. All of these analysis variations produce
shifts that are smaller than our threshold of σ/3 to trigger more thorough analysis. We discuss the remaining
data validation tests in Appendix B.

forest and compare to previous work. We also discuss
recent work on the expected size of the shift in the BAO
peak due to contributions from nonlinear clustering.

literature. These studies find that the shift is typically of
order ≲ 0.5%, and that the shift is greatly reduced after
reconstruction (see e.g. [87] and references therein). This
BAO shift occurs when the data are fit with a model that
does not incorporate the appropriate non-linear corrections. During the development of our DR2 analysis, the
first studies appeared in the literature that reported values for the BAO shift in the Lyα forest [88–90]. As our
analysis provides the first sub-percent Lyα BAO measurement, and there is no reconstruction applied to the
Lyα field, the impact of a Lyα BAO shift could be important. In this section we summarize the recent literature
on the BAO shift in the Lyα forest, provide an estimate
of the present theoretical uncertainty in the shift, and
describe how we add this as a systematic uncertainty to
our analysis.
Two studies of the shift [88, 90] used approximate
methods based on the Fluctuating Gunn-Peterson Approximation (FGPA) to paint Lyα forest skewers onto
dark matter fields obtained from either Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory [ALPT, 91] or N-body
simulations, respectively. These approaches make it possible to simulate sufficiently large volumes to precisely
measure the BAO position, although at the cost of less
accurate small-scale clustering. The third study [89] instead used an effective field theory (EFT) approach [92]
to fit Lyα power spectrum measurements from hydrodynamical simulations [93] and then used the measured
EFT parameters to predict the expected BAO shift5 .
This has the advantage of relying on hydrodynamical
simulations, which provide accurate small-scale clustering. However, these simulations are not large enough to
directly obtain a precise BAO constraint [93], which is
why [89] rely on the EFT approach.
Both [87] and [89] showed that the BAO shift is sensitive to the relation between the linear and quadratic
bias parameters in the EFT approach. Therefore, results
based on hydrodynamical simulations should in principle provide more accurate constraints on the BAO shift
compared to approximate methods of simulating the Lyα
field. However, the EFT approach [89] did not study
the impact of various simulation modeling choices on the
measured bias parameters and the resulting BAO shift.
For example, the model for Helium reionization and fluctuations in the UV background are likely to have an impact on these parameters. This impact needs to be studied and quantified in order for constraints on the BAO
shift from simulations to be used to correct measurements
from observations.
While all three of these efforts have made significant
progress on this important source of systematic uncertainty, there are also limitations to all three studies that
make it difficult to identify any one as the definitive measurement of the shift. Furthermore, the three results have

not converged on either the exact magnitude nor on the
direction of the shift, and all three only detect the shift
at about the ∼ 3σ level. In light of this discussion, we
decided to take the approach of adding an extra systematic uncertainty to account for a possible BAO shift due
to non-linear evolution, rather than estimate the value of
the shift and apply it as a correction.
We add this theoretical systematic component to our
total error budget via the covariance matrix of the two
BAO parameters:

These values are slightly larger than the shifts measured
by [89] (∼ 0.2% for the auto-correlation and ∼ 0.1% for
the cross-correlation when interpolated to z = 2.33) and
smaller than the 1% isotropic shift from [88]. Given the
significant recent interest in the Lyα BAO shift, there
is a high likelihood that much better measurements of
this shift will be performed in the near future, such as by
applying the EFT approach to real data. We therefore
highlight both the statistical and statistical+systematic
constraints separately to make it easy to update our results in light of this expected future work.

We note that the ratio DV /rd is only the optimal definition of the isotropic BAO parameter in the absence of
redshift space distortions. Different BAO measurements
have different combinations of DH and DM that minimize the correlation with fAP and will therefore have a
smaller relative uncertainty. The optimal combination
for DR2 Lyα is approximately

Comparison to Previous Work

We show our measurement of DH /rd and DM /rd in
Figure 12, which includes both the statistical-only result (red), and the statistical+systematic constraint (indigo). The figure shows the improvement in our BAO
constraints between DESI DR1 (blue) and the DR2 results presented here. We also plot the derived constraints
on DH /rd and DM /rd from two cosmological chains using external data. The orange contour shows the Planck
cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraint assuming flat ΛCDM [2] and the dotted black contour shows the
joint Planck CMB and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5
(Y5) supernovae constraints assuming a w0 wa CDM cosmology [95]. Figure 12 shows that our measurement is in
good agreement with both of these results, and provides
a significant, complementary constraint. This is explored
further in the companion paper [34], which combines this
Lyα result with BAO measurements from galaxies and
lower-redshift quasars.
Our new measurement from DR2 is also in very good
agreement with our measurement from DR1 [31], the
eBOSS DR16 result [25], and the fiducial cosmology [2]
listed in Table I. Figure 5 shows a comparison of our
result with the previous two Lyα measurements. The
figure demonstrates the robustness of the BAO measurement with the Lyα forest. Measurements with progressively larger datasets have remained statistically consistent, and have passed increasingly stringent tests for systematic errors in the analysis.
The dataset size has increased substantially between
the three measurements. The eBOSS DR16 measurement was based on 210,005 quasars with z > 2.10 that
were used to measure the Lyα auto-correlation function
and 341,468 quasars at z > 1.77 that were used for the
cross-correlation function measurement. The DESI DR1
approximately doubled the sample size with over 420,000
quasars for the auto-correlation measurement and over
700,000 for the cross-correlation, although as most of the
quasars analyzed for DR1 had only one observation (see
Figure 1), the typical SNR of DR1 was on average somewhat lower than for eBOSS DR16. The DESI DR2 sample is nearly twice the size of the DR1 sample, with over
820,000 quasars at z > 2.09 used for the auto-correlation
function measurement and over 1.2 million at z > 1.77
that contribute to the cross-correlation measurement. In
addition, most of the DR2 quasars have multiple observations.
There were multiple improvements in the data quality between the SDSS spectrographs [96] and the DESI
instrumentation [27]. One is that the DESI corrector
system includes an atmospheric dispersion corrector [44],
which greatly improves the spectro-photometric calibration. Another is that the DESI spectrographs are substantially more stable both because they are gravity invariant (bench mounted) and are located in a climatecontrolled room. The greater stability produces a much
more stable point spread function that leads to better

sky subtraction, as well as better wavelength calibration
that leads to smaller redshift errors. Another difference
is that the blue channel of the DESI spectrographs has a
somewhat higher range of spectral resolution (2000-3000)
than the SDSS spectrographs (1500-2000).
Lastly, there have been significant improvements to
the analysis methodology. One significant change from
eBOSS to DESI is that all of the DESI Lyα analysis
was developed with blinded data. Other notable changes
from eBOSS to DESI include, a substantial increase in
the number of mock datasets, improvements to the continuum fitting code, re-calibration of the spectra, improvements to the weights on Lyα pixels, inclusion of the
cross-covariance between the four correlation function
measurements, and improved descriptions for contamination by metals and high column density systems. The
two most significant changes from DESI DR1 to DESI
DR2 are to the calculation of the distortion matrix (see
Section III A) and modeling metals (see Section III B).
We also have adjusted the range of physical separations
we include in our correlation function measurements and
have included a theoretical systematic error for the first
time in a Lyα BAO measurement.

VII.

CONCLUSIONS

We report the most precise measurement of the BAO
scale with the Lyα forest to date. This measurement is
based on the first three years of operation of the main
DESI survey, and these data will be part of the planned
second data release (DR2). The sample is approximately
a factor of two larger than the DR1 dataset. The precision of these measurements is 1.1% along the line of
sight (α∥ ) and 1.3% in the transverse direction (α⊥ ).
The combination yields a statistical precision of 0.65%
in the isotropic BAO parameter at an effective redshift
zeff = 2.33.
This statistical precision, in conjunction with several
recent theoretical studies, have motivated us to include
a systematic error term in the DESI Lyα analysis for
the first time. Theoretical investigations have detected
a BAO shift based on Lyα with approximately 3σ significance [88–90]. These studies use different methods
and draw somewhat different conclusions on the size of
the shift, so we add a systematic uncertainty of ∆α∥ =
0.3%, ∆α⊥ = 0.3% to our covariance matrix rather than
apply a shift correction to our data. This theoretical systematic increases the uncertainty in the isotropic BAO
parameter to 0.70%.
These measurements of α∥ and α⊥ correspond to
measurements of the ratios DH (zeff )/rd = 8.632 ±
0.098(stat) ± 0.026(sys) and DM (zeff )/rd = 38.99 ±
0.52(stat) ± 0.12(sys), where DH (zeff ) is the Hubble distance, DM (zeff ) is the transverse comoving distance at
zeff = 2.33, and rd is the sound horizon at the drag epoch.
This paper is one of two key papers that present the
BAO measurements from DESI DR2. The other paper

20
[34] presents the measurement of the clustering of galaxies and quasars at z < 2.1 and the cosmological interpretation of the full set of DESI DR2 BAO measurements.
That includes the consistency of the DESI DR2 BAO
measurements with the ΛCDM model, the evidence for
dynamical dark energy, and new results on the sum of the
masses of the three neutrino species. These two papers
also have five supporting papers. This Lyα analysis has
supporting papers that describes how we identify DLAs
in the data [36] and the synthetic datasets we constructed
to validate our analysis [37]. An additional supporting
paper [35] presents our validation of the z < 2.1 BAO
measurement with galaxies and quasars. Lastly, there
are supporting papers that conduct further explorations
of dynamical dark energy models [38] and neutrinos [39].
We plan additional analyses of the DESI DR2 dataset
that will provide more precise measurements of many
cosmological parameters. This will include key papers
on the full-shape modeling of the clustering of galaxies
and quasars, similar to the studies with the DR1 dataset
[57, 58, 97], and the full-shape modeling of the Lyα forest [98, 99] with eBOSS. There will also be key papers on
local measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity, the
physical properties of the galaxies and quasars, combinations with lensing data, local measurements with peculiar
velocities, the mass distribution of the Milky Way, and
the construction of the large-scale structure catalogs.

Appendix A: Nuisance Parameters

Our fit to the four correlation functions has 17 parameters: the two BAO parameters α∥ and α⊥ , and 15
nuisance parameters. Table II lists all of these parameters, the priors on each of them, the best-fit values for the
combined (baseline) fit, and the best-fit values from fits
to just the two auto-correlations and just the two crosscorrelations. Note that not all of the nuisance parameters
are needed in the fits to just the auto-correlation or just
the cross-correlation. The table also lists the number of
data points (Nbin ) in each fit, the number of parameters
(Nparam ), the minimum χ2 value of the fit (χ2min ), and
the fit p-value.
The first two nuisance parameters in Table II are the
bias and RSD parameters of the Lyα forest, bα and βα ,
respectively. The next five are bias values for the main
metal lines that we expect in the Lyα forest region.
These are bSiII(1190) , bSiII(1193) , bSiII(1260) , bSiIII(1207) , and
bCIV(eff) , where the last one is labeled as “eff” instead of
with the rest-frame wavelength in Å because it also includes some contribution from other metal lines at longer
wavelengths (especially Mg II and Si IV). We have three
parameters for high column density (HCD) systems: a
bias parameter bHCD , an RSD parameter βHCD , and

25
a scale LHCD . The additional parameter LHCD is the
width of a filter that is used to model the wings of the
HCDs. The parameter bQ is the quasar bias. When we
fit the cross-correlation alone, we set a tighter prior on
the quasar bias of bQ = 3.5 ± 0.1 [100] to break the degeneracy between bQ and bα . We have two parameters
to account for redshift errors: ∆r∥ , which allows for a
systematic shift in quasar redshifts, and σv , which accounts for the combination of quasar peculiar velocities
and redshift errors [101]. The parameter ξ0TP sets the
amplitude of the proximity effect, which accounts for a
combination of the higher radiation field in the vicinity
of quasars and the higher gas density [12]. Lastly, the
parameter anoise accounts for correlated noise between
spectra from fibers in the same DESI focal plane petal,
which is dominated by the sky background model [102].
We refer to DESI2024-IV for a more detailed discussion
of the nuisance parameters and how they are included in
the model.
The nuisance parameters are generally of the same
order as their values in DESI2024-IV, and agree reasonably well between the best fit combined, auto-only,
and cross-only results. We do not expect exact agreement between the nuisance parameters, as their purpose
is to approximately account for known physical effects
that could impact the goodness-of-fit of the model, and
not to accurately measure these effects. When we analyze the auto-correlation or the cross-correlation alone,
we fix LHCD to the best-fit value of the combination
(LHCD = 5.3 h−1 Mpc). This is necessary to break internal degeneracies, but it makes the p-value of these
analyses difficult to interpret. Similar to DESI2024-IV,
we do not measure bQ , ∆r∥ , σv , and ξ0TP when we fit the
auto-correlation alone, as these quantities are only relevant to the quasar tracers, and we do not fit bCIV(eff) and
anoise when we fit to the cross-correlation alone, as these
quantities are only important in the auto-correlation fit.
We do not include a model for the impact of the relativistic effects described in [103], as was done in some
previous eBOSS analyses [21, 22]. This was not included
because of degeneracies with other effects that can cause
a dipole in the cross-correlation, including metal contamination and redshift errors. While Iršič et al. [103] showed
that it should not impact the location of the BAO peak,
Lepori et al. [104] demonstrated that DESI should have
the statistical power to measure this effect, and we plan
to include these effects in future work.

Appendix B: Data Validation

This appendix describes additional data analysis variations beyond those already described in Section V B.
All were run as part of the tests before unblinding our
analysis, and all were rerun after unblinding on the final DR2 dataset (loa). The results are summarized in
Figure 13 and all but one of these shifts pass our σ/3 criterion. The one apparent exception is the “only quasar

targets” variation. This variation corresponds to a more
significant sample size change than the other variations.
We confirmed that the size of the shift for this variation
is consistent with the sample size difference relative to
the baseline sample. These variations are discussed in
greater detail in DESI2024-IV.
The tests are split into four categories based on the
nature of the analysis variation. The first set with violet
errorbars show the BAO shifts from alternative analyses with a different estimation of Lyα forest fluctuations,
without changing the dataset. The variations are as follows: 1) no calibration: We do not perform the recalibration of the spectra using the C III region described in
[28]; ηpip = 1: We do not apply the recalibration of the
instrumental noise η that is used in the baseline analysis;
ηLSS = 3.5: We use non-optimal weights and reduce by a
factor of two the contribution from the intrinsic Lyα forest variance to the weights; ∆λ = 2.4 Å: We coadd three
pixels into one before performing the continuum fitting
and assigning weights. In this case we use the value of
ηLSS = 3.1 that was found to be optimal for this coarser
pixelization in [28].
The red errorbars show the BAO shifts from alternative analyses that result in small changes of the dataset.
These are: λobs < 5500 Å: We only use Lyα pixels below this observed wavelength, rather than the baseline
value of λobs < 5577 Å; λobs > 3650 Å: We only use Lyα
pixels above this observed wavelength, rather than the
baseline value of λobs > 3600 Å; λRF < 1200 Å: We only
use Lyα pixels below this rest-frame wavelength, rather
than the baseline value of λRF < 1205 Å. zQSO < 3.78:
We only include quasars with zQSO = 3.78, which is
the highest redshift included in the mocks; > 50 pixels
in forest: We include lines-of-sight with more than 50
valid Lyα pixels. For the baseline analysis we require
at least 150 pixels; only quasar targets: We only use
quasars that were considered quasar targets. This variation causes a more significant change in the size of
the dataset as described above; Mask DLAs in spectra
with SNR RED > 3 DLAs: We only mask DLAs identified in quasar spectra with SNR REDSIDE > 3, instead
of the SNR REDSIDE > 2 threshold used in the baseline
analysis; Weak BALs: We do not include the Lyα forest of
those quasars where we have identified very strong BAL
features. This only excludes BALs with AI > 840, corresponding to the 50% percentile of strongest BALs [74].
No sharp lines mask: We do not mask the four sharp
lines discussed in [28], related to sky lines and Calcium
absorption features from the interstellar medium of the
Milky Way.
The green errorbars show the BAO shifts from alternative measurements of the correlation functions, their covariances, and the distortion matrices. We look at the following variations: dmat r∥ < 200 Mpc/h: We only model
the distortion matrix up to r∥ = 200 Mpc/h, while the
baseline analysis extends the model to r∥ = 300 Mpc/h;
dmat 2%: We use 2% of the dataset to compute the distortion matrix, rather than 1% as in the baseline analysis;

FIG. 13. One-dimensional shifts in the BAO parameters for alternative analysis choices. These include variations in the
method to estimate the fluctuations (purple), the dataset (red), the method to compute correlations and covariances (green),
and modeling choices (blue). The red shaded regions show the one σ uncertainty from the main analysis and the smaller gray
area shows the threshold set to these tests (σ/3). The two parameters are anti-correlated with ρ = −0.48. The only shift that
exceeds the σ/3 threshold is the “only quasar targets” dataset variation. This larger shift is consistent with the change in the
sample size. See Appendix B for more details.

TABLE II. Priors, best-fit values (mean of the posterior) and uncertainties (68% credible intervals) for the 17 free parameters
in the fits. Some parameters are not needed when fitting the auto-correlation or the cross-correlation alone.

28
dmat dr = 4 Mpc/h: We model the distortion matrix using the same binning as in the measurement of the correlation function (4 Mpc/h), rather than 2 Mpc/h binning
as in the baseline analysis; dmat model z-indep: We
ignore the redshift evolution in the computation of the
distortion matrix, as was done in eBOSS and in DESIDR1; ∆λ = 3.2 Å: We re-bin the continuum-fitted deltas
by four pixels (rebinned pixels of 3.2 Å), rather than by
three pixels as in the baseline analysis (rebinned pixels
of 2.4 Å); ∆λ = 1.6 Å: We re-bin the continuum-fitted
deltas by two pixels (rebinned pixels of 1.6 Å), rather
than by three pixels as in the baseline analysis; nside
= 32: We measure the correlations in HEALPix pixels
defined by nside=32 (instead of nside=16 in the baseline), which results in 3646 HEALPix pixels with at least
one quasar (rather than of 1028 HEALPix pixels in the
baseline analysis); ∆r = 5 Mpc/h: We use a 5 Mpc/h
binning of the correlation function, rather than 4 Mpc/h
as in the baseline analysis.
The blue errorbars show the BAO shifts from alternative analyses with different modeling choices. We investigate the following variations: Gaussian redshift
errors: We use a Gaussian distribution to model quasar
redshift errors and quasar peculiar velocities, rather
than the Lorentzian model used in the baseline analysis; no prior on L0 HCD: We remove the informative
prior on the parameter LHCD in the model of the con-

tamination by HCDs; no prior on beta HCD: We remove the informative prior on the parameter βHCD in
the model of the contamination by HCDs; no prior
on drp QSO: We remove the informative prior on the
parameter ∆r∥ in the model of quasar redshift errors; no prior on bias QSO: We remove the informative prior on the quasar bias parameter bQ ; no prior on
bias CIV eff: We remove the informative prior on the
parameter bCIV,eff in the model of the contamination by
CIV absorption; UV fluctuations: We model the impact of fluctuations in the UV background [105, 106] on
the Lyα forest auto-correlation following the prescription
of [21]; ignore small-scales correction: We ignore
the small-scale, multiplicative correction from [107] in
the model of the Lyα auto-correlation; ignore modeling
of sky residuals: We ignore the contamination from
correlated sky residuals in the Lyα auto-correlation, discussed in [102]; ignore quasar radiation: We ignore
the transverse proximity effect, the impact of quasar radiation in the cross-correlation. The χ2 and ∆χ2 values
(relative to the baseline) of these different modeling variations are listed in Table III. The ∆χ2 values are significant for the last three, all of which remove effects that
we expect to be present in the data. We include these
variations to demonstrate our implementation does not
impact BAO.
