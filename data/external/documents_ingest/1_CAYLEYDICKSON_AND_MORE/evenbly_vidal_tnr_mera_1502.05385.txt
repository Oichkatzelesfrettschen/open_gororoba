We show how to build a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) representation of the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian H by applying the recently proposed tensor
network renormalization (TNR) [G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, arXiv:1412.0732] to the Euclidean time
evolution operator e−βH for infinite β. This approach bypasses the costly energy minimization of
previous MERA algorithms and, when applied to finite inverse temperature β, produces a MERA
representation of a thermal Gibbs state. Our construction endows TNR with a renormalization
group flow in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians (and not merely in the more abstract
space of tensors) and extends the MERA formalism to classical statistical systems.

Consider a strongly interacting quantum many-body
system in D spatial dimensions described by a microscopic Hamiltonian H. Understanding its collective, low
energy behavior is a main goal in condensed matter and
high energy physics, one that poses a formidable theoretical challenge. To tackle this problem, plenty of methods
have been proposed based on the renormalization group
(RG) [1–3], that is, on studying how the physics depends
on the scale of observation. Weakly interacting systems
can be addressed perturbatively using momentum space
RG [2]. Instead, strongly interacting systems often require non-perturbative, real space RG methods, as pioneered by Kadanoff [1] and Wilson [2].
Improving on Kadanoff and Wilson’s proposals,
White’s density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
for quantum spin chains [4] established how to systematically preserve the ground state wave-function during realspace coarse-graining – namely, by preserving the support of its reduced density matrix. Similarly, Levin and
Nave’s tensor renormalization group (TRG) [5] taught
us how to coarse-grain Euclidean path integrals of onedimensional quantum systems (also partition functions
of two-dimensional classical systems). Both DMRG and
TRG are very successful, versatile approaches. However,
they depart significantly from the spirit of the RG, in
that they produce a coarse-grained, effective description
of the system that still retains some irrelevant microscopic details. As a result, these methods (i) fail to define
a proper RG flow, one with e.g. the correct structure of
fixed points; and (ii) struggle to deal with critical systems
or systems in D ≥ 2 dimensions, where the accumulation
of irrelevant microscopic degrees of freedom is more significant and harmful.
These difficulties have been solved with two closely related proposals. First, entanglement renormalization was
put forward to address the above two problems in the
context of ground state wave-functions [6, 7]. By introducing disentanglers, which remove short-range entangle-

ment, a proper RG flow is generated, as well as an RG
transformation that is computationally sustainable even
at criticality. In addition, entanglement renormalization
leads to an efficient tensor network description of ground
states for critical systems, the multi-scale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA) [7], of interest not only
as a many-body variational state [7–14] but also as a lattice realization of the holographic principle [15, 16].
Tensor network renormalization (TNR), on the other
hand, was more recently proposed to tackle the same
problems in the context of Euclidean path integrals (and
classical statistical systems)
[17]. The Euclidean path

integral Z ≡ tr e−βH is represented by a tensor network, consisting of copies of a single tensor A [18], which
extends both in space and Euclidean time directions.
Through local manipulation of this tensor network, TNR
produces a sequence of tensors,
A → A′ → A′′ → · · · → Afp ,

(1)

corresponding to increasing length scales, which flow towards some infrared fixed-point tensor Afp . The later
retains only the universal features of the phase or phase
transition [17]. Once again, the key of the approach is
the removal of short-range correlations by disentanglers.
In this Letter we establish a close connection between
the two approaches. We show that, when applied to the
Euclidean path integral restricted to the upper half plane,
TNR generates a MERA for the ground state of Hamiltonian H. More generally, TNR also produces a MERA for
the thermal Gibbs state ρβ ≡ e−βH /Z at finite inverse
temperature β, as well as for the low energy eigenstates
of H on a finite periodic chain. Our result provides an
alternative route to the MERA, one that bypasses the
costly energy minimization of previous algorithms [8, 9]
and has several other significant advantages, both conceptual and computational, that we also discuss. Among
those, we emphasize that (i) we obtain the first correct
MERA representation of the thermal state ρβ [19], to-

2
gether with an algorithm to find it; (ii) the connection
implies that TNR produces an RG flow in the space of
wave-functions and Hamiltonians, and not just in the abstract space of tensors, Eq. 1; (iii) the MERA formalism
can be applied now also to classical statistical systems.
For simplicity, we consider a translation invariant system
in D = 1 dimensions, although the key results generalize
to inhomogeneous systems in dimension D ≥ 1.
Tensor network for Euclidean time evolution.— Given
a translation invariant Hamiltonian H in one dimension, we use a standard procedure [20] to produce a
two-dimensional tensor network representation of the Euclidean time
operator e−βH or Euclidean path integral

−βH
tr e
. This tensor network is made of copies of a
single tensor A. If both the system size L and the inverse temperature β are infinite, then the network spans
the entire (x, τ )-plane, where x and τ label space and Euclidean time, respectively. Here we will consider tensor
networks for e−βH on three different geometries, obtained
by introducing a horizontal cut at τ = 0 and by choosing
L and β to be either finite or infinite [21].
TNR yields MERA.— Let us start with the upper half
plane, Fig. 1, which corresponds to the ground state |Ψi
of H on an infinite lattice. The network has an open
boundary at τ = 0, with an infinite row of open indices,
one for each site of the one-dimensional lattice on which
H acts. We first apply TNR everywhere on the upper half
plane except near τ = 0, where we keep the open indices
of the tensor network untouched. TNR acts through an
intrincate sequence of local replacements [17]. Here we
skip the technical details [22] and focus instead on describing the final result: a coarse-grained tensor network
with effective tensor A′ for most of the upper half plane,
in accordance with Eq. 1, together with a double row
of special tensors, so-called disentanglers and isometries,
which correspond to one layer of the MERA [23]. These
tensors connect the microscopic degrees of freedom at
length scale s = 0 (represented by the original open indices of the network) with the coarse-grained degrees of
freedom at length scale s = 1 (represented by the lower
indices of the lowest row of tensors A′ ). We can now repeat the process on tensors A′ , to obtain coarse-grained
tensors A′′ and a second row of disentanglers and isometries, i.e. a second layer of the MERA, connecting scales
s = 1 and 2. Iteration then produces a full MERA approximation for the ground state |Ψi of H, encompassing
all length scales s = 0, 1, 2, · · · .
Thermal MERA.— Let us now consider a horizontal
strip of finite width β, Fig. 2(a), which is proportional
to the thermal state ρβ ≡ e−βH /Z. This time we have
two boundaries, each with an infinite row of open indices: the incoming and outgoing indices of the Euclidean
time evolution operator e−βH . As before, we use TNR
to coarse-grain the tensor network, except near its open
boundaries, where we do not touch the open indices. Fig.
2(b) shows the net result: a coarse-grained tensor net-

infinite lattice. It is made of copies of tensor A and restricted
to the upper half plane (x, τ + ), with a row of open indices
at τ = 0. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor network while
leaving the open indices untouched, we obtain a new tensor
network with tensors A′ together with one row of disentaglers and isometries. (c) Further coarse-graining of the tensor
network produces new coarse-grained tensors A′′ and a second layer of disentanglers and isometries. (d) By iteration we

work, with effective tensor A′ , together with a double
row of disentanglers and isometries both for the incoming
and outgoing indices. After O(log2 (β)) iterations of the
coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a MERA representation of the thermal state, Fig. 2(c) made of O(log2 (β))
double layers of disentanglers and isometries for both the
incoming and outgoing indices, together with a central
row of tensors. Disentanglers and isometries are isometric tensors and thus do not affect the spectrum of eigenvalues of the thermal MERA, which therefore depends
exclusively on the central row of tensors [24].
The thermal MERA obtained from TNR resembles the
form first suggested by Swingle in the context of holography [15], where a 1+1 conformal field theory is dual
to a gravity theory in 3 space-time dimensions. In this
context, the thermal MERA is interpreted as describing a
space-like cross-section of a black hole space-time geometry. A significant difference in our construction is the central row of tensors, which is absent in Swingle’s proposal
[15] and provides ρβ with the correct thermal spectrum
of eigenvalues {e−βEi /Z}, where {Ei } are the eigenvalues of H. This central row of tensors can be thought of
as representing the Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the
two asymptotic AdS regions [25], which seems to provide
a manifestation of the ER=EPR conjecture [26].
Periodic chain of size L.— In our third construction,
we use TNR to coarse-grain a tensor network for the
ground state of Hamiltonian H on a periodic chain of size
L, see Fig. 3(a). The network consists of a semi-infinite,

width β, with two rows of open indices. It is proportional to
the thermal state e−βH /Z. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor

coarse-graining produces a thermal MERA.

vertical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices.
After about O(log2 (L)) coarse-graining steps the size of
the system has effectively become O(1), see Fig. 3(c), and
we have O(log2 (L)) layers of the MERA connected to a
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a
transfer matrix T . The dominant eigenvector of T leads
to the ground state of H, whereas subdominant eigenvectors describe low energy eigenstates.
To illustrate the computational possibilities offered
by the new algorithm, we consider the one-dimensional
quantum Ising model with transverse magnetic field both
at finite β for an infinite chain, and at zero temperature
for a finite periodic chain of length L [27]. The calculation required less than 5 minutes on a 2.5Ghz dual
core laptop with 4Gb of memory (MERA bond dimension
χ = 10). First, for L = ∞, Fig. 4(a) shows the expectation value of the energy density Ethermal ≡ tr(ρβ H)/L as
a function of the inverse temperature β, while Fig. 4(b)
displays, at critical magnetic field, the crossover between
polynomial decay of correlations at short distances (due
to quantum fluctuations at criticality) and their exponential decay at longer distances (due to finite temperature
statistical fluctuations). Then, for β = ∞, Figs. 4(c)(d) show, respectively, the low energy spectra of H as a
function of the inverse system size 1/L, and the energy
and momentum of low energy states for L = 1024. In all
cases, an accurate approximation to the exact result is
obtained.
Discussion.— Since its proposal a decade ago [7], the

MERA has been regarded as a variational class of states.
Accordingly, one attempts to approximate the ground
state |Ψi of H by optimizing the variational parameters contained in the disentanglers and isometries of the
MERA, for instance by iteratively minimizing the expectation value of H [8, 9]. Such energy optimization is
costly (it may require thousands of sweeps over scale) and
prone to becoming trapped in local minima. Moreover,
there is no guarantee that the end result is an approximation to the ground state |Ψi – one just has a wavefunction with, hopefully, reasonably low energy. Here
we have argued that, instead, an approximate MERA
representation of the ground state |Ψi can be obtained
with TNR by coarse-graining an initial, quasi-exact tensor network representation of |Ψi [29]. This only requires
one sweep over scale, and it is therefore computationally
much more efficient [30]. In addition, at each coarsegraining step TNR introduces a truncation error [17] that
can be explicitly computed. If this truncation error is
sufficiently small, then one can certify that the resulting
MERA approximates the true ground state |Ψi within
that small error [31].
Importantly, TNR acts locally: the coarse-graining of
the tensor network at point (x, τ ) only depends on the
tensors in an immediate neighborhood [17]. Let us mention three consequences for the resulting MERA. (i) Since

identity I (red), spin σ (green), and energy density ǫ (blue)
primary fields of the Ising CFT, [28]. Discontinuous lines
in (c) and (d) correspond to the finite-size CFT prediction,
which ignores corrections of order L−2 .

TNR is not aware of the system size L or inverse temperature β, it produces the same tensors A, A′ , A′′ , · · · and
disentanglers and isometries for the ground state |Ψi in
the thermodynamic limit (L = β = ∞) as it does for the
states ρβ and |Ψ(L) i at finite β or L. Thus, a single TNR
calculation produces an accurate MERA approximation
for all these states. (ii) In the absence of translation invariance, where a different tensor Ai may be required for
each site i of the lattice, the coarse-graining of different
parts of the system can be conducted in parallel, leading
to a massive reduction in computational time. (iii) At a
conceptual level, locality of TNR implies the validity of
the theory of minimal updates [33]. This theory, which
asserts that only certain parts of the MERA need to be
changed in order to account for a localized change in the
Hamiltonian H [33], is particularly useful in the study of
systems with boundaries, defects, or interfaces [9, 14].
In Summary, in this Letter we have shown that, when
applied to the Euclidean path integral restricted to sev-

eral geometries, TNR [17] produces a MERA for the
ground state and thermal states of a quantum Hamiltonian, and have explored a number of consequences of
this result. We conclude by briefly mentioning two more
implications. First, thanks to this connection, TNR inherits from the MERA its ability to define an RG flow
in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians [6–8].
Notice that extracting the emergent physics from these
RG flows should be easier (both conceptually and computationally) than extracting it from the RG flow in the
more abstract space of tensors, Eq. 1. Second, although
we have focused on quantum systems, TNR can also be
applied to statistical partition functions [17]. Therefore
the present construction extends the MERA formalism
(including strategies to extract universal critical properties [10–14]) to classical statistical systems.

not invariant under translations, a different tensor Ai
may be needed for each site i of the lattice.

Refs. [15] in the context of holography have a flat spectrum of eigenvalues and therefore do not reproduce the

on the half upper plane, these tensors remain.
[24] The normalization factor Z corresponds to the trace of
the thermal MERA. Since the conjugate layers of disentanglers and isometries do not change this trace, Z is also
the trace of the central row of tensors Amax , or an infinite
power of some (transfer) matrix M obtained from tensor
Amax by contracting its vertical indices. A normalized
thermal MERA is then obtained by replacing Amax with
Amax /λ, where λ is the dominant eigenvalue of M .

[31] We emphasize, however, that TNR is not committed to
exclusively producing a MERA. For instance, if at some
scale s the ground state approximately decomposes as
the product of two ground states, then the corresponding

tensor A(s) will approximately factorize as A1 ⊗ A2 ,
and TNR will give rise instead to a branching MERA
[32], which was proposed to describe e.g. highly entangled
phases of matter in D ≥ 2 dimensions.

Appendix A.– A tensor network for the Euclidean
path integral

In this section we describe how to obtain a convenient, quasi-exact tensor network representation of the
partition function/Euclidean time path integral Z ≡
tr E −βH (or Euclidean time evolution operator e−βH ),
starting from the short-ranged Hamiltonian H of a 1D
quantum system on the lattice. This tensor network is
used in the main text as the starting point to obtain
MERA representations for the ground state and thermal
states of H in infinite and finite systems, see also Appendix B. It is also used in Appendix C.
For simplicity, we assume that H is a sum of nearest
neighbor terms only,
X
hi,i+1
(2)
H=
i

[Longer- (but finite-) range terms can be treated with a
slightly more complicated scheme.] The first step is to
split H into two contributions, H = Heven + Hodd
X
X
hi,i+1 ,
Hodd ≡
hi,i+1 , (3)
Heven ≡
even i

odd i

and use a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [34] to approximately express eβH as the P -fold product of operators
eǫHeven and eǫHodd ,
P
eβH ≈ e−ǫHeven e−ǫHodd , ǫ ≡ β/P ≪ 1.

the form e−ǫhi,i+1 . (b) Same tensor network after decomposing each two-site gate using a singular value decomposition,
according to the inset. (c) Final tensor network for the Euclidean path integral in terms of copies of a single tensor A.

This introduces an error of order O(βǫ), which therefore
vanishes in the limit of small ǫ/large P . [One can obtain an error O(β(ǫ)n ), n > 1, by using a higher order
Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [35]]. Since Heven is a sum
of terms that act on different sites and therefore commute, eǫHeven is simply a product of two-site gates, and
similarly for eβHodd ,
Y
Y
e−ǫhi,i+1 , e−ǫHodd =
e−ǫhi,i+1 .
e−ǫHeven =

odd i

(5)
Each two-site gate e−ǫhi,i+1 is a tensor made of four indices. Therefore we have obtained a tensor network representation of e−βH , see Fig. 5(a). Using singular value
decompositions (in the vertical and horizontal direction,
as indicated in the inset of Fig. 5) we can then transform
this tensor network into a new tensor network made of
four-legged tensors A connected according to a square
lattice pattern.
However, by construction e−ǫhi,i+1 is very close to the
identity, e−ǫhi,i+1 = I + O(ǫ), which implies that the
square tensor network is highly anisotropic. It is then
convenient to coarse-grain in the Euclidean time direction, until space and time direction have become qualitatively equivalent, in the sense e.g. that the ordered singular values of a tensor in both directions decay roughly
in the same way. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.

FIG. 6. (a) Tensor network for the Euclidean path integral
produced in Fig. 5, made of copies of a single tensor A. (b)
We can introduce isometries (obtained e.g. from the singular
value decomposition of a vertical pair of tensors A) to define a
new tensor Ã. (c) In the new tensor network, each row of tensors Ã accounts for two rows of tensors A, in such a way that
the anisotropy between space and Euclidean time directions
has been reduced. The initial square tensor network discussed
in the main text is the result of applying this compression in
the Euclidean time directions a few times.

where L denotes the length of a periodic chain and β
is the inverse temperature. Here we use H (L) and H ≡
H (L→∞) to denote a Hamiltonian on a periodic lattice of
size L and on an infinite lattice, respectively.
We consider four geometries, obtained from combinations of infinite and finite L and β. These geometries are
(L)
represented in Fig. 7. The partition function Zβ corresponds to a torus of size L and β in the horizontal and
vertical directions, respectively, which are parameterized
by space and Euclidean time coordinates (x, τ ). Then
(L)
e−βH corresponds to the vertical cylinder obtained by
cutting the torus at τ = 0, as represented in Fig. 7(d).
At infinite length L, this cylinder is replaced by an
infinite strip of finite width β, representing e−βH , which
is proportional to the thermal state ρβ of Fig. 7(b), with
(L)

ρβ ≡ lim ρβ .

Therefore, for finite L, the Euclidean time evolution operator on a semi-infinite vertical cylinder is proportional
to the ground state |Ψ(L) i of H (L) , Fig. 7(c).
Finally, for infinite β and L, the semi-infinite cylinder
above is replaced with the upper half plane and produces
the ground state |Ψi of H, Fig. 7(a).
We have therefore attached a geometry to each of the
ground states and thermal states |Ψi, ρβ , |Ψ(L) i, and
(L)
ρβ . In the main text we consider explicitly the coarsegraining of the tensor network for the first three geometries in Fig. 7, that is (a) - (c), and the fourth one [the
finite cylinder (d)] is left as an exercise that follows from
the previous cases.

Appendix C.— Tensor Network Renormalization,
step by step

In this section we review the detailed sequence of local
replacements that define the coarse-graining transformation of TNR. For convenience, we have introduced some
cosmetic changes compared to Ref. [17].
The actual sequence is shown in Fig.
8.
It
involves a number of intermediate tensors (namely
B, u, vL , vR , x, y, w) in addition to the final coarsegrained tensor A′ . When applied to an infinite square
tensor network made of copies of tensor A, Fig. 9, these
local replacements produce a coarse-grained tensor network made of copies of a new tensor A′ , where there is a
copy of A′ for every four initial tensors A. None of the
intermediate tensors appear in the coarse-grained tensor
network. We can think of TNR as implementing a global
change of scale, from (x, τ ) to (x′ , τ ′ ) where
x → x′ = x/2,

τ → τ ′ = τ /2.

(10)

Let us now consider instead applying TNR to coarsegrain the restriction of the initial square tensor network
on the upper half plane, as represented in Fig. 10. Recall
that this restriction defines a projector onto the ground
state of H. By applying the sequence as local replacements of Fig. 8, we see that most of the upper half plane
ends up in a coarse-grained square tensor network again
made of tensors A′ . However, near the open boundary of

8
the tensor network first a row of disentanglers u, and then
a row of isometries w, accumulate. These disentanglers
and isometries cannot annihilate with Hermitian conjugates u† and w† because those would belong to the lower
half plane, which is not available.
As discussed in the main text and Fig.1 of the main
text, iteration of the coarse-graining produces a full
MERA for the ground state |Ψi of H. Let us now give a
geometrical interpretation of this construction. It turns
out that TNR allows to implement local scale transformations on the lattice [36], that is, a discrete version
of certain conformal transformations in the continuum.
From this perspective, the MERA results from (the discrete version) of the conformal trasformation that maps
the upper half plane into the hyperbolic plane H2 .
If in the continuum we start with a flat metric in the
upper half plane (x, τ ), the infinitesimal square line element is given by dx2 + dτ 2 , which we can rewrite as
τ 2 (dx2 /τ 2 + dτ 2 /τ 2 ). Then a local change of scale (Weyl
re-scaling) by τ −1 (that is, by an amount that depends on
the Euclidean time coordinate τ ) produces a new metric
dx2 + dτ 2 → (dx2 /τ 2 + dτ 2 /τ 2 )

FIG. 9. (a) Square tensor network made of infinitely many
copies of tensor A. (b) Plaquettes of four tensors A are replaced by a tensor B and other tensors according to Fig. 8(a).
(c) Pairs of disentanglers u and u† annihilate according to
uu† = I. (d) We decompose each tensor B according to Fig.
8(c). (e) Tensor A′ and isometries w are introduced according to Fig. 8(e). (f) Pairs of isometries w and w† annihilate
according to ww† = I, producing the final tensor network,
which contains only copies of the tensor A′ .

(11)

which corresponds to H2 . Finally, we have also replaced
the Euclidean time coordinate τ with the scale coordi-

nate s ≡ log2 (τ ), which labels the different layers of the
MERA.
Returning to the discrete geometry of the square tensor network, notice that the net effect of iterating TNR
on the (discrete) upper half plane as discussed above is
that we are introducing a change of scale where locally
the metric is changed by an amount proportional to the
distance τ = 2s to the boundary, that is exponential in
the scale variable s, as in the above conformal transformation.
Appendix D.– TNR versus energy minimization

FIG. 8. Sequence of elementary steps involved in TNR. (a)
Each block of four tensors A is approximately replaced with
an auxiliary tensor B, as well as disentanglers u and isometries
vL and vR . The last three are determined through a local
optimization [17], that is, one that only knows about the four
tensors A and is therefore insensitive to the rest of the tensor
network. (b) Definition of the auxiliary tensor B in terms of
A, u,vL , and vR . (c) Tensor B is approximately replaced by
the product yx−1 . (d) Tensors x and y are such that y −1 Bx is
equal to the identity, and are therefore also determined locally.
(e) A combination of tensors is approximately replaced with
tensor A′ and isometries w, w† . The isometry w is determined
through a local optimization. (f) Definition of tensor A′ .

In this section we compare the accuracy and efficiency
of two methods that allow us to obtain a MERA approximation to the ground state |Ψi of a many-body Hamiltonian H: (i) TNR and (ii) energy minimization [8, 11, 12].
We use the 1D quantum Ising model, with Hamiltonian

where X and Z are Pauli matrices, as a benchmark model
for comparison. The ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian H at critical magnetic field strength, λ = 1, is represented using a scale-invariant MERA obtained in these
two ways. The scale invariant MERA considered here
consists of three transitional layers followed by infinitely
many copies of a scale-invariant layer [8, 11, 12].
TNR.— In the first approach, we start by generating
the Euclidean path integral for H, as described in sec-

FIG. 10. (a) Ground state |Ψi of H, represented by a tensor
network on the upper half plane made of copies of tensor A.
(b) Approximately equivalent tensor network obtained by replacing blocks of four tensors A with the auxiliary tensor B
and disentanglers and isometries, according to Fig. 8(a). (c)
The disentanglers annihilate pairwise according to uu† = I,
everywhere except at the open boundary. (d) We approximately replace tensor B by the product yx−1 according to
Fig. 8(c). (e) An approximately equivalent tensor network
is obtained by introducing tensor A′ and the isometry w,
according to Fig. 8(e). (f) The isometries annihilate pairwise according to ww† = I, everywhere except near the open
boundary. The net result is thus a coarse-grained tensor network on the upper half plane with tensors A′ and a row of
disentanglers u and isometries w at the open boundary, which
define a layer of the MERA.

FIG. 11. (a) Relative error in the ground energy (per-spin) for
the ground state of the 1D quantum Ising model at criticality,
comparing MERA of bond dimension χ optimized either using
TNR or variational energy minimization. (b) Relative error
in the ground energy from (a), now plotted as a function
of the leading order computational cost of the optimization
method, which scales as O(χ6 ) for TNR and O(χ9 ) for energy
minimization.

see Eq. 1 in the main text. A scale-invariant MERA
is then built from tensors (disentanglers and isometries)
produced while implementing TNR, as described in the
main text. Here the first three iterations of TNR generate
the three transitional layers, while the fourth iteration of
TNR is used to build the scale-invariant layer.
Energy minimization.— In the second approach, we
use the energy minimization algorithm of Ref. [8, 11, 12]
to directly optimize a scale-invariant MERA (with three
transitional layers preceding the scale-invariant layers) by
iteratively minimizing the expectation value of the H.
The comparison between the ground energy error δE
obtained by the two methods is presented in Fig. 11.
For an equivalent bond dimension χ, energy minimization produces a MERA with smaller error δE than TNR,
by a factor k ≈ 10 that is roughly independent of χ. That
energy minimization would produce a more accurate estimate of the ground state energy than TNR was to be
expected, for two reasons. First, the energy minimization
algorithm directly targets the ground energy as its figure
of merits, whereas TNR does not. Second, the energy
minimization algorithm optimizes the MERA by sweeping back and forth over length scales/layers many times,
whereas TNR considers each length scale only once, without returning back to optimize shorter length scales after
coarse-graining larger length scales.
However the cost of optimization also differs between
the approaches: the leading order cost of energy minimization scales as O(χ9 ), whereas the cost of TNR scales
as O(χ6 ). There is also a significant difference in the
number of optimization steps required to reach a converged result. The energy minimization algorithm requires many more steps to converge, as the algorithm
sweeps over scales thousands of times, compared to TNR,
which treats each scale only once. The difference between
the two approaches in terms of the number of optimization steps required is difficult to quantify as it depends on
many factors, but here we find that energy minimization
requires roughly an order of magnitude more steps than
TNR. Fig. 11(b) compares the energy error δE between
energy minimization and TNR as a function of the leading order computational costs of the approaches. Even
though this comparison does not take into account the
difference in the number of optimization steps between
the approaches, TNR is already seen to be more computationally efficient in producing a MERA approximation
to the ground state within some specified accuracy δE
than the energy minimization algorithm.

Appendix E.– TRG yields a tree tensor network
(TTN)

tion A. Then we apply four coarse-graining iterations of
TNR, after which the flow in the space of tensors has
reached an approximate scale-invariant fixed-point Afp ,

The main result of this paper is to show that when
TNR is applied to a tensor network representing the Euclidean path integral of a quantum Hamiltonian H (re-

10
stricted to the upper-half plane), it generates a MERA
approximation for the ground state of H. In this section we show an analogous result for TRG: we show that
when applied to the same tensor network, it generates
instead a tree tensor network (TTN) approximation for
the ground state of H.
This result, which extends to several generalizations of
TRG, offers an alternative perspective to understand the
qualitative differences between TRG and TNR, and provides a robust theoretical argument for why TRG cannot realize a critical fixed-point tensor while TNR can
[17]. Indeed, the failure of TRG to produce a critical
fixed-point tensor can be understood to follow from the
well-known fact that the TTN ansatz (with fixed bond
dimension) cannot reproduce the logarithmic scaling of
entanglement entropy, SL ∼ log(L), found in the ground
states of 1D quantum systems at a critical point.
For simplicity, we will derive this result not for the
original TRG, but for an improved version known as
higher order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG),
which was proposed in Ref.[38]. However, the same conclusions can also be shown to hold for the square-lattice
form of the original TRG algorithm proposed in Ref.[5].
We begin with brief summary of HOTRG, see Fig. 12.
Consider a square lattice tensor network made of copies
of a tensor A with components Aijkl and bond dimension
χ. In HOTRG, one coarse-grains the tensor network first
in one direction and then in the other. We shall begin
with the horizontal axis. In the first step, left-right pairs
of tensors A are multiplied together, obtaining the sixindex tensor Ã,

(a) A left-right pair of tensors A is multiplied
to form a new tensor Ã, which is then decomposed using a
truncated HOSVD into the product of a core tensor B and a
pair of isometries w, see also Eqs. 13 and 14. (b) The product of an isometry w and its conjugate produces the identity,
see Eq. 16. (c) A up-down pair of tensors B is multiplied
to form a new tensor B̃, which is then decomposed using a
truncated HOSVD into the product of a core tensor A′ and a
pair of isometries v. (d) The product of an isometry v and its
conjugate produces the identity. (e) The sequence of transformations from (a-d) above is used to coarse grain a 4 × 4
network of tensors A, yielding a 2 × 2 network of tensors A′
surrounded by isometries w and v.

as shown in Fig.12(a). We now should truncate the double indices j ≡ (j1 j2 ) and l ≡ (l1 l2 ) of Ã, which are of
dimension χ2 , down to dimension χ. In HOTRG this
truncation is performed using a generalized form of the
SVD called the higher order singular value decomposition
(HOSVD), a method of decomposing an N rank tensor
into the product of a core tensor and a set of isometric
tensors. Using the HOSVD, the tensor Ã is approximately decomposed into a core tensor B (with all four
indices of dimension χ), and a pair of isometries w and
w† (with their three indices also of dimension χ),

simplicity, that the network is invariant under spatial reflection along the horizontal axis such that the top and

this simplifying assumption.] Isometries w satisfy the

as depicted in Fig.12(b). After the HOSVD, we obtain
a new square lattice tensor network composed of tensors
B and rescaled by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direction. Following the same steps but now in the vertical
direction, up-down pairs of tensors B are multiplied together to form a six-index tensor B̃, which can then be
decomposed using the HOSVD into a product of a core
tensor A′ and a pair of isometries v and v † , see Fig.12(c).
[Again, for simplicity, we have assumed that the network
is invariant under appropriate spatial reflection.] The
combination of horizontal and vertical contraction steps
has taken the initial square lattice network of tensors A
to a new network of tensors A′ , one which is rescaled by
a factor of 2 on both axes. This constitutes a single iteration of the HOTRG approach. By iteration, we generate
a sequence of increasingly coarse-grained lattices defined

Let us now apply HOTRG to a square lattice tensor
network representation of the ground state of a Hamiltonian H on a periodic chain of size L, as we did in the main
text for TNR. The network consists of a semi-infinite, vertical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices at the
bottom, see Fig. 13(a). Each coarse-graining iteration

rescales the bulk of the network by a linear factor of 2,
while leaving a row of isometries w along the open boundary, see Fig.13. After about log2 (L) coarse-graining steps
the size of the system has effectively become O(1), and
we have O(log2 (L)) layers of the TTN connected to a
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a
transfer matrix T ; taking the dominant eigenvector of T
as the top tensor of the TTN leads to the ground state
of H. Thus the HOTRG approach, applied to the Euclidean path integral of a quantum system H, has been
shown to generate a TTN approximation for its ground
state.
Since the introduction of TRG, a significant improvement in renormalization schemes for tensor networks has
been the use of the so-called environment to achieve a
more accurate truncation. The second renormalization
group (SRG) proposed in Ref.[39] uses to knowledge from
the environment, obtained approximately by iteratively
sweeping over all length scales, to allow the tensor truncations to be performed so as to minimize the global error, as opposed to the local error minimized in TRG and
HOTRG. Ref. [38] introduced a version of SRG based
upon HOSVD, called the HOSRG, which we will now
consider. The use of the environment allows HOSRG
to more accurately discern which degrees of freedom can
be truncated, and which should be retained, at each RG
step. This allows for a smarter choice of isometries. However, HOSRG is structurally still based upon the same
blocking scheme as HOTRG, Fig.12(e). It follows that
HOSRG also leads to a TTN representation of ground
and excited states as depicted in Fig.13. The only difference being that the isometries w that compose the
TTN have been better chosen with HOSRG than with
HOTRG, as they minimize the global error. In particular, for the same bond dimension χ, HOSRG may produce a more accurate TTN approximation to the ground
state than HOTRG.
However, as it happens with HOTRG (and TRG),
HOSRG cannot generate a proper RG flow in the space
of tensors – that is, one that at criticality flows to a critical fixed-point tensor. Indeed, HOSRG produces a TTN,
which is known to only be able to accurately describe a
critical system if the bond dimension grows with increasing scale. But a bond dimension that grows with scale is
incompatible with having a fixed-point tensor.
