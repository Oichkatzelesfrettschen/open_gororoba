Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk
geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions.
By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to
deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover
the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further
extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence
on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering
the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent
advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization
method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.

Introduction

The AdS/CFT correspondence is a profound duality that relates a gravitational theory in
anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime to a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on its boundary.
Within this framework, the degrees of freedom of the boundary CFT encode the dynamics
of the bulk gravitational theory, providing a novel approach to studying strongly coupled
quantum systems. This correspondence has had significant implications across various fields,
including quantum chromodynamics, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity [1, 2].
One of the most striking features of AdS/CFT is its ability to translate complex problems
in field theory into more tractable geometric problems in the bulk. A key example is the
Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) [3] and Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) [4] proposals, which
establish a connection between boundary entanglement entropy (EE) and extremal surfaces
in the bulk. These proposals suggest that the entanglement structure of the boundary state
plays a fundamental role in the emergence of bulk geometry. However, understanding how
this boundary entanglement data reconstructs the full bulk spacetime remains an open
problem in general.

Traditionally, holographic models of field theory phenomena begin with a well-defined
supergravity action that exhibits clear symmetries. However, the reverse problem known
as bulk reconstruction is equally intriguing and significantly more challenging. It involves
reconstructing the dual holographic spacetime, along with any dynamic matter fields, from
boundary field theory data. This process raises fundamental questions about how the boundary
is represented within the bulk geometry. While various methods for bulk reconstruction have
been proposed [5–21], most rely on precise knowledge of boundary quantities. In realistic
scenarios, however, handling imprecise and discrete boundary data is crucial [22, 23].
Despite substantial progress, the question of how gravitational degrees of freedom emerge
from a non-gravitational boundary theory remains one of the deepest mysteries in holography.
Resolving this issue continues to drive research at the intersection of quantum field theory,
gravity, and information theory.
In this work, we take a step toward addressing this challenge by seeking guidance from
mathematics. Rather than assuming a specific bulk theory from the outset, we explore what
mathematical structures can reveal about the possible ways in which a bulk spacetime could
emerge from boundary data. While a complete classification of holographic spacetimes is
beyond the scope of our study, our research premise is to aim to identify key mathematical
principles that govern the reconstruction process. By doing so, we hope to gain insights
into how boundary information constrains the possible geometric structures in the bulk
and what this implies for the nature of holographic dualities. For instance, in gapped field
theories, reconstructions using slab-shaped entangling regions fail because entanglement
entropy saturates due to the finite correlation length [24–26]. This is because of homogeneous
boundary data; it would be interesting to attempt bulk reconstruction with more generic
planar deformations [27]. In contrast, ball-shaped entangling regions can probe the full bulk
geometry, making them more suitable stepping stones for reconstruction. We see this work
as a first step, laying the groundwork for future investigations that may eventually lead to a
deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of holography through entanglement.
We emphasize that key foundational questions remain unresolved. For example, AdS
spacetime can clearly be foliated by maximally symmetric minimal surfaces, hemispheres
of varying radii, hanging from the asymptotic boundary. Yet, it remains an open question
whether a spacetime M with the same minimal surface areas as for AdS must necessarily
be identified with AdS itself. From a mathematical perspective, the difficulty of the bulk
reconstruction problem is not surprising. The problem is related to inverse boundary
value problems for partial differential equations (PDE), a field of mathematics with many
long-standing open questions. The inverse problem most closely related to this work is
the anisotropic Calderón problem on Riemannian manifolds, which investigates whether a
Riemannian manifold with boundary can be uniquely determined by the so called Dirichletto-Neumann map of the Laplace equation. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann map in general is an
operator that sends a boundary value for a PDE to the normal derivative of the solution
corresponding to the boundary value. The connection of the anisotropic Calderón problem
to the bulk reconstruction in AdS/CFT, is that area data of minimal surfaces determines
the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the minimal surface equation.
Despite over four decades of active research in inverse problems, the anisotropic Calderón
problem remains unresolved in dimensions three and higher, with only limited progress

1.1 Problem statement and methodology
Per holographic duality, the area A of a minimal surface Σ corresponds to the entanglement
entropy of the associated boundary region A [33],
SEE =

A
,
4GN

(1.1)

where ∂Σ = ∂A and GN is the Newton constant, which can be related with QFT quantities
in string theory settings. See figure 1 for an illustration. If one knows the metric of
bulk spacetime, then it would be a straightforward exercise to compute the area A of the
codimension-two minimal surface Σ. The bulk reconstruction problem arises from knowing,
in principle, the left-hand side of (1.1), the entanglement entropy, and seeking to determine
the corresponding bulk geometry that would reproduce the area on the right-hand side.
This constitutes an inverse problem, where one aims to infer geometric data from boundary
entanglement information.
However, it is important to recognize that the quantity in (1.1) is formally divergent, and
thus the entanglement entropy itself cannot directly serve as input data for reconstructing
the bulk geometry. Instead, variations of the entanglement entropy relative to a reference
configuration provide a well-defined and physically meaningful starting point. It is natural,
then, to ask how does the entanglement entropy responds to changes in external parameters,
or to deformations in the size or shape of the entangling region A. These variations induce
corresponding changes δA in the areas of the associated bulk surfaces, thereby encoding
information about the underlying geometry.
We investigate the problem of recovering the metric of a spacelike hypersurface from
the area data of minimal surfaces anchored at infinity of asymptotically AdS spacetime. We

achieved in these cases [28]. For example, even the fundamental question of whether a
Riemannian manifold with the same boundary and Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as a Euclidean
domain is Euclidean remains open.
Nevertheless, recent advances in inverse problems for nonlinear PDEs, originating
from [29], and subsequently for Laplace-type PDEs from [30, 31], have opened promising new research directions. For a recent survey, see [32]. These breakthroughs leverage
nonlinearity as a powerful tool in inverse problems, with the higher-order linearization method
emerging as a key technique. This method involves taking multiple derivatives of the nonlinear
equation and the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map with respect to small parameters
in the data, enabling the recovery of various coefficients in inverse problems. Recently,
this approach was employed in [31] to reconstruct two-dimensional minimal surfaces from
their areas on three-dimensional compact Riemannian manifolds. This general method is
discussed in detail in section 2.1.
One of the primary objectives of this work is to establish a link between recent progress in
the mathematics of inverse problems, particularly the results in [31], and the physics of the RT
proposal, which relates areas of minimal surfaces to entanglement entropy. Specifically, we aim
to adapt the higher-order linearization method to the study of the duality in asymptotically
AdS spacetimes. With natural modifications, we anticipate that these methods will also find
applications in the context of the HRT proposal for extremal surfaces.

where e is the Euclidean metric and x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn−1 ) ∈ Rn−1 . Metrics of this form
include, for example, time slices of AdS black holes (see section 3). While the methods of [31]
demonstrate that f can be recovered in the compact setting (and for n = 3), they rely on
the existence of complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions, or Faddeev’s Green’s functions.
Unfortunately it is unclear what the corresponding solutions are in the noncompact setting.
For this reason, we focus on recovering perturbations δf about pure AdS, i.e., f = 1 + δf ,
utilizing known solutions to the linearized minimal surface equation in pure AdS [37].
A perturbation δf of the metric (1.2) leads to a perturbation δA. Here, δA is considered
a function of how minimal surfaces are anchored to infinity z = 0. For example, if minimal
surfaces are anchored to a boundary of a ball (a sphere) of radius R, we denote the bulk
area perturbation by δA(R). This δA(R) is supplemented to us by the entanglement entropy
data about a ball-shaped subregion either by changes in external parameters (temperature)
or responses to area deformations such as scaling. In the latter case, this means to have

where δE is the “hyperbolic” energy of the perturbed state. It has been shown [42] that if
the bulk metric obeys the linearized vacuum Einstein equations, then (1.3) holds. Thus, this
condition can be viewed as a holographic dual of the Einstein equations (at the perturbative
level) in the vacuum. Moreover, [39] established that this condition is both necessary and
sufficient under broad assumptions. While their work does not reconstruct the bulk metric
under the additional constraint (1.3), they demonstrate that the bulk metric must satisfy
the linearized Einstein equations.
In the mathematics literature, the related Calderón problem (see the earlier discussion) has
been studied for Einstein metrics in [43]. Although their results are not directly applicable to
the RT proposal (particularly because the linearized minimal surface equation is a Schrödinger
equation rather than the Laplace equation), their analysis suggests that bulk reconstruction
from EEs should be feasible in general settings for Einstein metrics (of Euclidean signature).
To our knowledge, the RT bulk reconstruction problem under (1.3) has not been studied in
the mathematical literature, making it a compelling open question.
1.2 Summary of results
1.2.1 Recovery of δf (z)
We first consider the case where δf = δf (z), i.e., δf depends only on z and n ≥ 3. We show
that δf can be recovered from the area data of minimal surfaces anchored at infinity as
spheres S n−2 of varying radii R. For n = 3, we derive the explicit inversion formula:

work for shape deformations of balls within holography [27, 38]. It is worth emphasizing
that in this work we focus on entangling regions which are not strips nor slabs that have
thus far been the most popular ones within bulk reconstruction. We consider entangling
regions which are close to balls.
At first glance, it might seem peculiar that our starting point involves hemisphere
embeddings, the minimal surfaces in pure AdS. However, this choice is natural when
considering small entangling regions. In asymptotically AdS spacetimes, the corresponding
minimal surfaces for small regions remain close to those in pure AdS. Since we are perturbing
around AdS, there is no intrinsic scale against which “small” can be measured within the
deformed geometry itself. Therefore, it is both convenient and justified to begin with the
pure AdS background and parametrize deviations via f (z) = 1 + δf (z). In this way, we
reconstruct the geometry near the boundary and propose a scheme to recover the full bulk
geometry beyond leading order.
We do not impose any assumptions on the equations satisfied by the bulk metric (other
than requiring it to take the form (1.2)). However, we would like to highlight a connection
to works such as [39–41], which, as we do, study the bulk reconstruction problem on the
perturbative level. There δSEE is assumed not only to encode perturbations in the areas
of minimal surfaces under the RT proposal but also to satisfy

holding for z > 0. This formula indicates that recovering δf (z) at “height” z = R requires
′ (R) and δS ′′ (R). We

1.2.2 Recovery of δf (z, x, y)
Next, we study the case where δf = δf (z, x, y) for n = 2. We assume δf admits a finite-order
spherical harmonic expansion:
δf (ρ, θ, ϕ) ≈

(H1 v1 v2 +H2 (∇v1 ,∇v2 )+H3 ·(v1 ∇v2 +v2 ∇v1 )+H4 w+H5 ·∇w) .

(1.6)
This identity corresponds to varying how the minimal surface is anchored to infinity with
respect to two parameters ϵ1 and ϵ2 . This quantity can be considered as the linearized version
of entanglement density ∂ϵ2 ∂ϵ1 |ϵ1 =ϵ2 =0 Aϵ1 ,ϵ2 of [44, 45]. Here, H1 , . . . , H5 are functions/tensors
that depend on δf (z, x, y), while v1 , v2 , and w are solutions to the first and second linearized
minimal surface equation in pure AdS. We expand the coefficients H1 , . . . , H5 in terms of
the spherical harmonic coefficients alm of δf . Then, by plugging in a special set of solutions
v1 , v2 , and w into (1.6), we extract information about the coefficients. This is a typical
argument in inverse problems for PDEs.
The special solutions we use for v1 and v2 are provided by Hubeny in [37]. These
solutions take the form Φ(ϕ)Θ(θ), where:

with m ∈ Z as a free parameter. By selecting specific values of m for v1 and v2 , we solve for
the spherical harmonic coefficients up to order l = 4. Recovering coefficients for a general
spherical harmonic expansion by this method remains an open question, but we note that
using Hubeny’s solutions in (1.6) provides infinitely many conditions for the coefficients
of the expansion.

recovering the leading-order perturbation δf = (z/zH )3 from δSEE (R). We derive similar
formulas δf (z) as (1.4) for n > 3, through higher-order linearizations to order n + 1 or n,
depending on whether n is odd or even, of δSEE (R) are required for them.

1.3 Recovering f from A using inversion of δA
Finally, we address the reconstruction of not just the perturbation δf (z), but the entire
metric function f (z), under the assumption that f remains close to unity (|f (z) − 1| ≪ 1).
This reconstruction is enabled by the explicit inversion formula (1.4) in dimension 3 and
its higher-dimensional generalizations (3.33) and (3.39).
The statement of the problem is the following: given the minimal surface area function
r 7→ Af (r), associated with an unknown metric function f ≈ 1, we aim to reconstruct f (z)
entirely from the boundary data Af . The key insight is the first-order approximation
(1.7)

where δA is the linearized area variation induced by the perturbation δf = 1 − f . Since
Af − Af =1 is known from boundary measurements, the inversion formula for δf yields a
first-order approximation of 1 − f (z) in terms of this observable difference.
While (1.7) captures the leading-order behavior, higher-order corrections O(|f − 1|2 )
must be incorporated for an accurate reconstruction. To achieve this, we propose an iterative
scheme inspired by the implicit function theorem:
1. Initialization: begin with the trivial AdS metric f0 (z) ≡ 1.
2. Iterative Update: at each step n, refine the estimate via
fn+1 (z) = fn (z) − (DA|f =1 )−1 (Afn − Af ) ,

(1.8)

where (DA|f =1 )−1 is the inverse operator provided by our explicit linearized inversion
formula (1.4), Afn is the area data for minimal surfaces computed for fn , and Af is
the given area data.
3. Convergence: the iteration proceeds until fn converges, reconstructing the full nonlinear metric f (z).
This method is particularly suited for low-temperature black hole metrics (1.5) (where
zH ≫ 1), as they remain perturbatively close to AdS. We discuss convergence criteria,
numerical implementation, and broader implications in section 5.

Bulk reconstruction

In this work, we investigate the problem of recovering bulk geometric deformations from
corresponding variations in boundary entanglement entropy. Specifically, we address the bulk
reconstruction problem at the linearized (perturbative) level, working to first order around
a fixed background geometry. In this regime, changes in entanglement entropy translate
into variations in the areas of extremal surfaces, which in turn encode information about
the underlying bulk geometry.
To make this connection precise, we consider small perturbations of the bulk geometry
around a fixed background metric g0 , typically taken to be pure AdS unless otherwise
specified. That is, we write the full metric as
g = g0 + δg ,

–7–

JHEP10(2025)079

Af − Af =1 = δA + O(|f − 1|2 ) ,

where δg encodes the leading-order deviation from the background. According to the RT
proposal, the entanglement entropy of a boundary region A in the CFT is dual to the area of
a codimension-two minimal surface Σ in the bulk satisfying ∂Σ = ∂A. In the perturbative
setting, this translates into a variation of the minimal surface area,
A = A0 + δA ,

determines the minimal surface embedding.
2.1 Review of bulk recovery in the compact case and the higher-order
linearization method
As said, we address the bulk reconstruction problem at the perturbative level. Our approach
is however motivated by recent developments in the nonlinear problem in the compact case,
where the spacelike hypersurface is a compact Riemannian manifold (as opposed to an
asymptotically AdS spacetime).
When the spacelike hypersurface is a compact Riemannian manifold, the recovery of
the metric from the areas of minimal surfaces anchored at its boundary has been recently
explored in [31, 46] (see also [17]). The works [31, 46] consider the full nonlinear problem
of reconstructing the bulk metric from minimal surface area data, and mostly focus on the
case where the Riemannian manifold is three dimensional and the minimal surfaces are
two-dimensional. The first of these works [46] recovers the three-dimensional bulk metric

–8–

JHEP10(2025)079

where A0 is computed in the background geometry and δA captures the leading-order change
due to δg. A more general, nonlinear, setting is discussed in section 5.
Given the knowledge of how entanglement entropy changes under small deformations of
the entangling region or under variations of external parameters such as temperature, the
RT formula allows us to relate these variations to the area corrections via δA = 4GN δSEE .
The central inverse problem we address is to reconstruct the metric perturbation δg from
this area data.
In section 3, we focus on spherical boundary regions, where ∂Σ are spheres of radii r > 0
at the boundary of AdS. It is worth emphasizing that we keep the boundary regions intact, so
the entanglement data that induces area perturbations stem from varying external parameters.
Using these, we reconstruct perturbations δf (z) of the function f = 1 in the metric

under additional geometric and topological assumptions. The second [31] recovers individual
two-dimensional minimal surfaces in a general setting but does not address how these surfaces
can be “glued” together to reconstruct the full three-dimensional bulk metric.
It remains an open question whether the methods developed in [31, 46] can be extended
to non-compact Riemannian manifolds with asymptotic infinity. Our linearized approach
avoids the potential complications of these methods in the non-compact setting while still
providing physically relevant insights into the bulk reconstruction problem. The restriction
to first-order perturbations also allows us to develop reconstruction methods that are also
computationally tractable. To provide context and motivation for our approach, we next
outline how metric recovery is achieved in the compact case and under what conditions. This
discussion naturally leads into the methodology employed in the present work.
The recovery of minimal surfaces from the area data of minimal surfaces in [31] relies
on the higher-order linearization method, a technique recently developed in the study of
inverse problems for nonlinear partial differential equations [29, 30, 47]. To explain the
method in more detail, suppose that X is a manifold with boundary ∂X equipped with
a Riemannian metric g. Consider also an embedded minimal surface Σ whose boundary
∂Σ lies entirely in ∂X.
Next consider nearby minimal surfaces, which can be considered as solutions u = uµ to
the minimal surface equation (see e.g. [4, appendix B.2])




g αβ ∂α ∂β uµ + Γµνλ ∂α uν ∂β uλ − Γγαβ ∂γ uµ = 0 ,

(2.5)

where α, β correspond to coordinates on the surface and the other Greek indices go from
1, . . . , dim(X). We let the nearby solutions anchor to ∂X in a manner, which is described
by three deformations F1 , F2 , and F3 of ∂Σ and their magnitudes ϵ1 , ϵ2 , and ϵ3 . This gives
us a three parameter family of minimal surfaces, which we write as
uϵ1 F1 +ϵ2 F2 +ϵ3 F3 .
Each uϵ1 F1 +ϵ2 F2 +ϵ3 F3 is the unique solution to the minimal surface equation determined by
the deformation ϵ1 F1 + ϵ2 F2 + ϵ3 F3 of ∂Σ, illustrated in figure 2, and ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = 0
corresponds to the original minimal surface Σ with boundary ∂Σ. In [31], the minimal
surfaces are two-dimensional, so the functions Fj are defined on one-dimensional manifolds.

Figure 2. Illustration of the boundary deformation δ(∂A) of the entangling region A enclosed by the
black curve ∂A = ∂Σ. We will limit on deforming ∂A = S 1 , however.

In the current work, the functions Fj can for example be defined on the circle S 1 , which
corresponds to the intersection of a hemisphere with the asymptotic infinity. See section 3.2.
(To avoid possible confusion, we mention that [31] uses Fermi-coordinates to write the
minimal surface equation (2.5).)
Let us use the notation ϵ = 0 to denote ϵ1 = ϵ2 = ϵ3 = 0. By taking the derivative ∂ϵj |ϵ=0
of the minimal surface uϵ1 F1 +ϵ2 F2 +ϵ3 F3 , we have that the function
v j :=

∂
uϵ F +ϵ F +ϵ F
∂ϵj ϵ=0 1 1 2 2 3 3

(2.6)

∆g v + qv = 0

(2.7)

(assuming in addition that the variation in ϵj is normal, i.e., g(vj , T Σ) = 0). Above, g = gαβ
is the induced metric on the minimal surface (which we aim to recover), and q is a certain
geometry dependent function on the minimal surface. If the area data of two-dimensional
minimal surfaces is known, it is possible to recover g up to a conformal transformation by
studying solutions to the linearized equation (2.7) as was shown in [31]. In other words, the
first linearization allows us to recover the minimal surface up to a conformal transformation.
(In fact, this recovery corresponds to a solution [31] to a Calderón inverse problem on Riemann
surfaces.) Due to the coordinate invariance of the problem, the recovery of g is, at best,
possible only up to an isometry.
To recover the remaining unknown conformal factor, the argument in the compact case
proceeds to higher-order linearizations. By applying the area data to the second linearizations
∂2
uϵ F +ϵ F +ϵ F ,
∂ϵj ∂ϵk ϵ=0 1 1 2 2 3 3

(2.8)

one can recover quantities such as the extrinsic curvature, i.e., the second fundamental
form. Roughly speaking, the recovery of the quantities here relies on demonstrating that
products of three complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions, along with their gradients,
to the linearized equation (2.7) form a complete set. Once the coefficients of the second
linearization of the minimal surface equation are determined, one proceed to the third
linearization. The conformal factor can then be recovered from the third linearization and
the area data. See [31] for these steps.
To construct the full three-dimensional bulk metric, the recovered two-dimensional
minimal surfaces must still be glued together. For this, one at least needs to assume that all
of the bulk can be reached by some minimal surfaces, which are anchored on the boundary
entangling regions.1 In [46], this gluing was achieved under specific curvature and foliation
assumptions.
In summary, the recovery process of the bulk metric in the compact case proceeds
as follows:

We note that holographic geometries have so called entanglement shadows [48, 49], which are regions
which cannot be probed by any minimal or extremal surfaces. The study of such geometries may require
additional input beyond spatial entanglement data [50].

Recent mathematical developments in bulk reconstruction include the work [51], which
reconstructs the bulk metric from renormalized areas of minimal surfaces in asymptotically
hyperbolic manifolds by “Taylor” expanding the metric at asymptotic boundary. In compact
settings, inverse problems for minimal surfaces have been investigated in various geometric
contexts [52–54], including Euclidean space Rn . The Calderón problem on hyperbolic
manifolds was considered by [55]. In the AdS/CFT context, [56] established connections
between renormalized areas of minimal surfaces and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the
(linearized) minimal surface equation.

Linearized problem retaining Poincaré invariance

3.1 Derivation of the minimal surface equation
In this subsection we derive the minimal surface equation on a time slice of an asymptotically
AdS spacetime. We consider an asymptotically AdSn+1 metric of the form

the flat Euclidean metric in Rn−1 . Notice that we are assuming homogeneity and isotropy to
start with. The induced metric on spacelike hypersurfaces of constant t is then given by

We anticipate that these steps can ultimately be extended to the non-compact case as well.
It is worth noting that the solutions to each of these steps are not very explicit.
To the best of our knowledge, it remains unknown how any of the four steps outlined
above can be accomplished when the spacelike hypersurface under study is non-compact
and possesses an asymptotic infinity. In this work, we demonstrate that these steps can
be applied at the perturbative level in certain physically motivated special cases. Due to
the special form of the metric we study (see (3.1) below) the isometry in the recovery is in
fact just the identity. Interestingly, at the perturbative level, we also find that the steps
outlined above can have surprisingly explicit solutions.

This is an asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian metric on a manifold M of dimension n.
Conjoining the conformal infinity of AdS to the bulk manifold, we can think of M as a
manifold with a boundary separated by infinite proper distance from the points in the bulk.
The boundary corresponds to the value of the holographic coordinate z = 0.
Now consider an embedded hypersurface Σ ⊂ M such that ∂Σ ⊂ ∂M . Let x = (xi ), i =
1, . . . , n − 1 be the boundary coordinates of M and parametrize the hypersurface in terms of
x; the embedding of Σ then is F (x) = (x, z(x)). The chosen embedding works at least locally,
points where ∇z = (∂x1 z, . . . , ∂xn−1 z) becomes singular have to be dealt with separately.
The differential map of F is

This is the full nonlinear minimal surface equation, which is in general very difficult to
solve. Some useful closed-form solutions are known in pure AdS where f = 1, e.g., an
(n − 1)-dimensional hemisphere with the equator glued to an (n − 2)-dimensional sphere
on the boundary [37].
Ideally, we would like to recover the unknown function f (z) assuming that we know the
associated minimal surface areas based on entanglement entropy data on the boundary. An
explicit inversion is feasible at least when the boundary entangling region is formed by an
infinite strip/slab [8]. However, as discussed in Introduction, there are severe limitations to
bulk reconstruction using strip-like configurations. To bypass these complications, we shall
consider the simplest possible smooth and bounded entangling regions, i.e., balls. In this case
an explicit inversion of f (z) via methods of [8, 18, 22] relying on symmetry arguments seems
to fail.2 Therefore, instead of trying to solve the full problem right away we first consider the
linearized problem. In the end, it turns out that the solution to the linearized problem can
be used to construct the solution to the nonlinear problem with arbitrary precision.

role in what follows. Minimal surfaces Σs of the above metric have an infinite area. However,
2

Given a strip-like entangling region, the Hamiltonian associated with the bulk surface area involves a
cyclic coordinate, thanks to which an explicit relation between the strip width and the maximum bulk reach
of the minimal surface can be found. This then admits of explicit inversion of f (z) in terms of area data. For
spherical regions, similar symmetry arguments do not work: although in pure AdS a choice of coordinate
system adapted to the dilatation symmetry of the AdS metric enables identification of a first integral of the
Hamiltonian [57], in our case this symmetry is in general spoiled by the presence of f (z).

linearization of the area with respect to s yields a finite quantity if we impose sufficiently
strong decay conditions on the perturbation δf near the conformal boundary. From a field
theory perspective, this corresponds to focusing on deformations of the quantum state, i.e., no
operators have sources that would trigger a renormalization group flow. Then we can pose the
following inverse problem: Given linearized area data associated to hemispheres that foliate
(at least an open subset of) the interior manifold, and its first and second radial variations,
find δf . A natural reference frame for studying this setup is the spherical coordinate system
x = ρ sin θ cos ϕ ,

y = ρ sin θ sin ϕ ,

z = ρ cos θ.

(3.14)

Now we choose the radial coordinate ρ instead of z as the embedding function, which we
parametrize in terms of the angles θ, ϕ. The minimal surface solution depends on s, which
parametrizes the family of perturbed metrics, so we denote the solution by ρs = ρs (θ, ϕ).
Moreover, the area functional itself now explicitly depends on s so we write it as
Z

As [ρs ] =

Ls [ρs , ∇ρs ] ,

(3.15)

where Ls is the associated Lagrangian that depends on s. Linearization of the area with

is non-vanishing since ρ0 is a minimizer. δA is now a function that takes in a radius r and

Since the perturbation has a more complicated dependence on the bulk coordinates, the
simple analytic approach described in previous sections no longer works. Instead, we need to
consider more general boundary curves for minimal surfaces and study the second linearization
of the perturbed minimal surface equation. Let F = ϵ1 f1 + ϵ2 f2 + ϵ1 ϵ2 f12 : S 1 → R be the
boundary curve, and let ρFs be the minimal surface in (M, gs ) with boundary curve given

The form of the l.h.s. is identical to the first linearization of the minimal surface equation, but
now the first-order solutions appear on the r.h.s. as a source so that the equation becomes
inhomogeneous. Notice that if we have a solution w to the inhomogeneous equation, then also
w + v solves the inhomogeneous equation when v is a solution to the homogeneous equation,
i.e., a solution to the first linearized minimal surface equation (e.g., one of Hubeny’s solutions).
Remarkably, one can verify that given two first-order solutions uk , ul on the r.h.s. as a
source, one solution to the second linearized equation is
w = ρ−1

Since the first-order solutions satisfy the homogeneous equation, we are free to add any

Progress in nonlinear problem

Next, we consider the problem of reconstructing the full metric function f in (1.2), rather than
just its perturbation δf . We assume the knowledge of the area data Af for minimal surfaces

– 22 –

JHEP10(2025)079

where n > 0 since the only constant mode satisfying the boundary conditions is zero. Here
we have (n + 1)2 unknown coefficients to begin with, but we get (n + 2)(n + 1)/2 constraints
from the fact that alm = 0 for l − m even. Moreover, for a finite sum (4.23) becomes

anchored at the boundary z = 0 in the geometry determined by f . Under the assumption that
we are close to pure AdS, |f (z) − 1| ≪ 1, for all z, we develop a reconstruction method for f .
The key to our approach lies in the explicit representation for δf in term of the linearized
area functional δA, using the integral formula (3.20). Notably, our method requires only
the boundary area data Af as input. All other quantities appearing in the reconstruction
can be computed directly from the bulk metric (3.2).

with boundary condition |x|2 = r2 on the (x1 , . . . , xn−1 ) plane, and B(0, r) is a ball of radius
r in Rn−1 . Thus, A maps a given function f and radius r to the area of the minimal surface
anchored at infinity as a sphere of radius r.
The linearization of A at f = f0 is the operator DA|f =f0 defined as usual by
DA|f =f0 [w] :=

d
Af +tw .
dt t=0 0

We will consider the operator DA|f =f0 acting on various functions, but in the case w = δf ,
we write
δA = DA|f =f0 [δf ]
in accordance with our earlier notation. For brevity, we also denote
Af = A[f ] .
With these definitions we are now ready to describe a method to recover an unknown
function f = f (z) in the metric (5.2) from its area data Af . The approach assumes:
(1) f is a sufficiently small perturbation of a known function f0 .
(2) We have an explicit expression for the “inverse” (DA|f =f0 )−1 of the linearized operator
in the sense that (DA|f =f0 )−1 (DA|f =f0 ) = Id. Though this operator need not be a
two-sided inverse.
We note that the latter condition in the special case when f0 = 1 is satisfied. In this case,
the inverse operator (DA|f =f0 )−1 acting on any u = u(r) is given explicitly by

We now present the method in abstract terms, generalizing the setting slightly. The area data
can be expressed as a nonlinear operator A acting on functions f = f (z) defined as in (3.10) by

as we have shown when n = 3, see (3.20) in section 3.2. The above means that if u =
DA |f =1 [δf ], then δf (z) is given by (5.3):

(5.4)

|f − f0 | = δ ,
for some δ ≪ 1. We define the operator F acting on functions v = v(z) by
F [v] := v − (DA |f =f0 )−1 (A[v] − Af ) .

(5.5)

We stress that to compute F for given v, we only need to known the quantity Af . The
other quantities (DA |f =f0 )−1 and A[ · ] can be computed using the form (3.1) of the metric.
Especially, for any v, A[v] is obtained by solving the minimal surface equation with v in
place of f in the metric (3.1) and substituting into (5.1).
Our goal is to find a fixed point v ∗ for F satisfying |v ∗ − f0 | < δ. That v ∗ is a fixed
point means
F [v ∗ ] = v ∗ .
We now demonstrate that such a fixed point must coincide with the unknown function f we
seek to recover from the area data Af . To this end, assume then that v ∗ is a fixed point
with |v ∗ − f0 | < δ. It follows that
0 = (DA |f =f0 )−1 (A[v ∗ ] − Af ) .

(5.6)

We Taylor expand at v ∗ as
A[v ∗ ] − Af = DA |f =v∗ (v ∗ − f ) + O(|v ∗ − f |2 )
= DA |f =f0 (v ∗ − f ) + (DA |f =v∗ −DA |f =f0 ) (v ∗ − f ) + O(|v ∗ − f |2 ) ,

(5.7)

where | · | is some suitable norm we do not specify and the implied constant in the Onotation bounded since we assumed |v ∗ − f | ≤ |v ∗ − f0 | + |f0 − f | ≤ 2δ. Substituting the
expansion (5.7) into (5.6) shows that


0 = (DA |f =f0 )−1 DA |f =f0 (v ∗ −f )+(DA |f =v∗ −DA |f =f0 )(v ∗ −f )+O(|v ∗ −f |2 )
= v ∗ −f +(DA |f =f0 )−1 (DA |f =v∗ −DA |f =f0 )(v ∗ −f )+O(|v ∗ −f |2 ).
We may also Taylor expand at f0 as
DA |f =v∗ −DA |f =f0 = O(|v ∗ − f0 |) ,

The penultimate equality follows from (3.20). For dimensions n > 3, similar inversion
formulas are given in (3.39) and (3.33). We see that assumption (2) above is satisfied
when f0 = 1.
For general f0 (and not necessarily f0 = 1) we assume the condition (2) above. Assume
also that we are given the area data Af that corresponds to an unknown function f assumed
to be sufficiently close to f0 ,

with the implied constant in the O-notation is bounded due to |v ∗ − f0 | < δ. Substituting
this into (5.8) gives
v ∗ − f = O(|v ∗ − f ||v ∗ − f0 |) + O(|v ∗ − f |2 ) .
Since |v ∗ − f0 |, |v ∗ − f | < δ, this implies
|v ∗ − f | ≤ δK|v ∗ − f |
for some K > 0 independent of δ. From this it follows that if δ was small enough, it must be

(Otherwise one may divide by |v ∗ − f | to arrive at a contradiction.) Thus, we have shown
that when |f − f0 | = δ with δ sufficiently small, any fixed point v ∗ of F with |v ∗ − f0 | < δ
must coincide with the function f that we wanted to recover.
We next argue that the iteration defined by
vj+1 := F [vj ] ,

v 0 = f0

(5.9)

converges to a unique fixed point of F satisfying |v ∗ −f0 | < δ provided that δ was small enough.
Thus, by what we argued above, the iteration will then converge to v ∗ = f . Note that if v1 , v2
are two functions with |v1 − f0 |, |v1 − f0 | < δ, we can take the expansion (5.7) with v1 and v2
in place of v ∗ and f respectively then hit both sides of the equation with (DA |f =f0 )−1 to get
F [v1 ] − F [v2 ] = DF |f =v2 (v1 − v2 ) + O(|v1 − v2 |2 ) ,
where the implied constant in the O-notation is bounded due to |v1 − v2 | ≤ 2δ. Note that
DF |v2 = (DA |f =f0 )−1 (DA |f =f0 −DA |v2 ) ,
which implies that
DF |v2 (v1 − v2 ) = O(|v1 − v2 ||f0 − v2 |) .
Consequently, if δ was small enough (forcing |f0 − v2 | and |v1 − v2 | to be small), the operator
F is a contraction in the sense that
|F [v1 ] − F [v2 ]| ≤ C|v1 − v2 |
for some constant C < 1 independent of δ.
By the contraction property (5.10), we have
|vj+1 − vj | = |F [vj ] − F [vj−1 ]| ≤ C|vj − vj−1 | .
Iterating this estimate gives
|vj+1 − vj | ≤ C j |v1 − f0 | .

unique and at a distance less than δ from f0 , which follow directly from the fact that F
was a contraction. In summary
|vm − vl | ≤

The presentation here is, of course, not mathematically rigorous. We have not specified
which norm ∥ · ∥ we are using on function spaces and whether the operators A, DA|f =v∗ and
(DA |f =f0 )−1 etc. behave well on these function spaces. A rigorous mathematical study of the
limiting behavior of the iterative procedure (5.9) is beyond the scope of this current article.
We remark that analogous and mathematically precise arguments appear for example in [59].
5.2 Implementing the iterative algorithm: preliminary observations
For concreteness, let us spell out the first few steps in the iterative procedure. Denote the
points in the iteration by fi . Our zeroth approximation to the unknown function f is given
by f0 ≡ 1, which corresponds to the pure AdS. The next steps are
f1 = F (f0 ) = f0 − (DA|f0 )−1 (Af0 − Af )
f2 = F (f1 ) = f0 − (DA|f0 )

(5.13)

Thus, we are in effect constructing a series representation for the unknown f . Notice the
analogy to Newton’s method in the above algorithm; where the analogy fails is that the
inverse of the ‘derivative’ is here always evaluated at the same point. Remarkably, for any
function δA we have an explicit expression for δf = D−1 A |f0 δA given by (3.39) (in even
dimension) and (3.33) (in odd dimension). This is all we need in terms of metric perturbation
theory; we don’t need explicit formulas for higher order perturbations δ 2 f, δ 3 f etc. We remark
here that the series representation (5.12) applies for reconstructing metrics which are near
the Schwarzschild-AdS metric given in (3.44), at least in the low temperature regime when
zH ≫ 1. Indeed, since
1
fAdS−BH (z) =
1 − (z/zH )3
we see that fAdS−BH ≈ 1 when zH ≫ 1. So any metric fˆ which are near fAdS−BH when
zH ≫ 1 are also close to 1 and therefore can be represented via (5.12).
Even though the area quantities above are in fact just the ‘finite parts’ thereof, in
practice we take Afi and Af to be the non-regularized areas and write Adata = Af0 − Af ,
which is actually our regular data. Then we can augment the above procedure by writing
Afi − Af = (Afi − Af0 ) + Adata so that at each iteration we regularize the new area function
Afi against the corresponding quantity in pure AdS (by combining two divergent integrals
under a single integral sign so that the divergences in the integrands cancel out).

Discussion

Our analysis has focused on reconstructing aspects of the bulk geometry from boundary
data, but several subtleties remain. One key omission in our discussion is the divergence
structure of the entanglement entropy and how it behaves under changes in the cutoff.
The presence of universal terms, particularly in scenarios where the boundary deformation
includes cusps, introduces additional log-divergences, whose coefficients are often of physical
significance. A more detailed treatment of these divergences could provide further insight
into the universality of our reconstruction procedure.
Beyond leading-order corrections, a natural extension of our approach is to reconstruct
the full function f (z) ≈ 1 rather than just its perturbation δf (z). The limit of the iterative
formula (5.11), which is just the full f (z), suggests that, in principle, the entire black hole
metric (3.40) could be reconstructed, particularly in the regime where zH ≫ 1 (or equivalently,
at low temperatures). This would provide a more complete picture of the emergent bulk
spacetime from boundary data.
Several directions remain for future work. One important path is to understand how
uncertainties in the boundary data propagate to the reconstructed δf [22], which is essential
for practical applications. Another promising direction is the extension of our method to timedependent setups, such as holographic quenches [44], where the HRT prescription replaces
the RT formula. This would allow us to explore the dynamical aspects of bulk reconstruction
and their implications for nonequilibrium holography.
Finally, while our work represents an early step in understanding bulk reconstruction
from a mathematical perspective, it opens the door to further refinements and generalizations.
By incorporating more sophisticated mathematical tools and addressing these open questions,
we hope to move closer to a more complete picture of how spacetime emerges from field
theory data.

JHEP10(2025)079

Numerical implementation of the algorithm may be rather challenging. For this, we first
need to numerically solve the full minimal surface equation in the metric involving fi for a
large family of boundary disk radii. Then we evaluate numerically the integral Afi − Af0
where we plug in the numerical approximation for the embedding function of the minimal
surface corresponding to fi , and the hemisphere solution, and we do this for a number of
radii. Finally, we need a finite difference approximation for the first and second derivatives of
(Afi − Af0 ) + Adata to compute the next function fi+1 using the explicit inversion formula.
Controlling the numerical error through all these stages might require some care. The
computation is probably going to be quite costly unless we for some reason have very fast
convergence towards the sought-after function.
Our iterative scheme is reminiscent of the perturbative reconstruction method presented
in [8, section 6.1]. One notable difference, however, is that our algorithm is not based on a
Taylor expansion of the unknown function. Our algorithm is global in the sense that each
new step integrates over all the values of earlier iteration. As it is well-known that Taylor
expansion is highly unstable and sensitive to numerical errors, it is possible that our method
leads to better stability and convergence in the reconstruction.

Synthetic data

In this appendix we will generate the boundary data that can be used to infer the corresponding
metric deformation in the bulk spacetime. We will focus on three-dimensional CFTs and
obtain the change in the entanglement entropy for disks of radii R with an infinitesimal
temperature deformation about zero temperature.
Consider the minimal surface in the metric (3.41) anchored on a disk of radius R on the
boundary. In cylindrical coordinates (u, ϕ, z) related to the Cartesian coordinates by

where z(u) is the minimal surface embedding with z(u = R) = 0. By the RT formula, this
corresponds to the entanglement entropy of a disk of radius R in the boundary CFT at
finite temperature T = 3/(4πzH ). Linearizing the entanglement entropy around T = 0 then
corresponds to linearizing the minimal surface embedding z(u) and then the area function

the radius of the disk R fixed and varying the temperature, but since this is a perturbation
in the underlying CFT, it is equivalent to keep T = 0 and vary the radius instead. In other
words, the entangling surface A is kept intact, in this case the disk of area πR2 , but the
area of the dual hanging surface changes upon deformation by the temperature. We further
note that the perturbation arises at the third order power in T as we are not deforming
the Hamiltonian of the theory but the state.

As in [37], we want to linearize the minimal surface equation in pure AdS4 around the
hemisphere solution so we set f = 1 in (3.12). As it is easier to work in coordinates that are
natural for this problem, we transform the minimal surface equation (3.12) into spherical
coordinates and obtain the same equation as eq. (3.46) in [37]. To linearize the equation to
second order with respect to two parameters ϵ1 , ϵ2 , we expand the solution ρ(θ, ϕ) as
1
ρ(θ, ϕ) = ρ0 +ϵ1 u1 (θ, ϕ)+ϵ2 u2 (θ, ϕ)+ (ϵ21 v1 (θ, ϕ)+ϵ22 v2 (θ, ϕ)+2ϵ1 ϵ2 w(θ, ϕ))+O(ϵ3 ) ,

and plug it into the minimal surface equation. The first linearized minimal surface equation
becomes

The equation is the same for both u1 and u2 so we dropped the subscript for simplicity. Using
a separation of variables ansatz u(θ, ϕ) = Θ(θ)Φ(ϕ), we obtain
sin2 θ Θ′′ (θ)Φ(ϕ) + Θ(θ)Φ′′ (ϕ) + tan θ (sin2 θ + 1)Θ′ (θ)Φ(ϕ) = 0 ,

where l is, in general, real or imaginary. However, a negative separation constant would break
the 2π periodicity of u(θ, ·) so we can focus on the case l ∈ R. The ODEs are then solved by
Φ(ϕ) = A1 sin lϕ + A2 cos lϕ

The second linearization of the minimal surface equation with respect to one parameter and
a family of solutions thereof are given in eqs. (3.49) and (3.53) in [37]. Here however we
are interested in two-parameter linearization, in which case picking the coefficient of the
ϵ1 ϵ2 term in the minimal surface equation yields

Here u1 and u2 are arbitrary first-order solutions that act as a source for the second-order
solution. Notice that this could also be obtained from the one-parameter second linearization
by the polarization formula. Indeed, if we denote by W [u] as the second-order linearization of
