Abstract
Recent “low-energy” warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant gravitational
coupling κ0 with a spatially varying scalar field κ(x) set by an engineered metamaterial’s
electromagnetic response. We show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental
grounds. A prescribed, non-dynamical κ(x) in the field equation Gµν = κ(x)T µν clashes
with the contracted Bianchi identity, ∇µ Gµν ≡ 0, forcing ∇µ T µν ̸= 0 and thus violating local
energy–momentum conservation. Making κ(x) dynamical yields a scalar–tensor theory in
which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that breaks the strong equivalence principle;
Solar-System and pulsar-timing experiments already restrict |γ − 1| ≲ 10−5 , excluding any
technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that any interface
where κ changes demands a δ-function layer of stress–energy, while even steep continuous
profiles are ruled out by torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements.
Hence the concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and its
scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data.

Introduction

It has been speculated that one could engineer a material-dependent and hence positiondependent gravitational coupling,
κ(x) = S (x) κ0
(1)
with exotic “metamaterials” to mitigate the negative-energy demands of warp-drive metrics
such as Alcubierre’s [1–4]. Since any such device is finite, its internal κinternal must transition
to the ambient value κambient at its interface. This requires a boundary layer where κ(x) changes
rapidly, creating a concentration of stress-energy whose magnitude depends on the specific model
and must be carefully evaluated. We will demonstrate that this concept faces severe theoretical
and experimental obstacles making it non-viable under current physical principles.
Dynamical vs. prescribed κ(x). Simply replacing the Einstein coupling κ0 by a materialdependent and hence position-dependent coefficient [2, 3], Gµν = κ(x) Tµν , without endowing κ
with its own kinetic term, spoils local energy–momentum conservation.
However, it is important to distinguish this scalar–tensor framework from other layer-based
proposals. For example, Taylor [4] explores a piecewise-constant “engineering multiplier” applied to κ within each thin anisotropic shell, rather than a spacetime-varying scalar field. If κ
were allowed to depend on composition—taking different values for different kinds of matter—its
universality would be lost and the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) could be violated. By
contrast, a purely spatially varying but composition-blind κ(x) preserves the WEP, although it

still conflicts with local conservation unless promoted to a dynamical scalar; the Strong Equivalence Principle remains jeopardized in either case.
The (geometric) Bianchi identity, ∇µ Gµν ≡ 0, must hold in any metric theory of gravity.
Taking the divergence of the modified field equation therefore gives


0 = ∇µ Gµν = ∇µ κ(x)T µν = (∂µ κ) T µν + κ ∇µ T µν ,

so an externally prescribed, non-constant κ(x) forces ∇µ T µν ̸= 0 and thus violates local energy–momentum conservation even though the theory remains generally covariant.

which supplies the missing kinetic and potential terms. Accordingly, the Nordtvedt and PPN–γ
bounds quoted below apply only in that fully dynamical limit; a non-dynamical κ(x) is already
inconsistent with energy–momentum conservation at first principles.

For universal Brans–Dicke theories, the effective gravitational constant is set by the scalar field
according to

(5)
ϕ(x) 3 + 2ω
where (4 + 2ω)/(3 + 2ω) arises from the scalar’s kinetic-term contribution in the PPN limit.
Here ϕ(x) is the scalar field, conventionally normalized to its present-day background value
ϕ0 ≡ ϕ(x0 ) = 1. Because the matter coupling is universal, all test bodies share the same
Newtonian acceleration and the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) holds. The violation is the

with α = (2ω + 3)−1/2 and with the scalar field φ defined so that it decreases with radial
distance from an isolated mass, the positive sign yields an attractive fifth-force acceleration
directed toward the source.
The extra term is a universal fifth force; composition dependence enters only through
the tiny binding-energy fraction Uself /mc2 . Lunar-laser-ranging measurements constrain the
Nordtvedt (SEP-violating) acceleration to |∆a/a| ≲ 10−13 , i.e. |ηN | ≲ 10−4 [5].

so the scalar field multiplies the Ricci scalar (a non-minimal coupling to gravity), while all
matter fields Ψm remain minimally coupled to the metric gµν .
In the Jordan frame, matter follows geodesics and its stress–energy tensor is separately conserved; the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) therefore holds at leading order, while the
Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP) does not.

Matter now couples non-minimally to the metric via the overall factor e−2αφ , producing an

In the Einstein frame, matter does not follow geodesics: the gravitational action is canonical
and the scalar-dependent coupling produces an apparent universal “fifth force.” This structure
signals a violation of the SEP, whereas the WEP remains intact unless additional, compositiondependent (non-universal) couplings are introduced.

where Sij is the surface stress tensor, S ≡ hij Sij its trace, and hij the induced metric. Thus the
scalar field itself remains continuous across the boundary, but a jump in its normal derivative
is fixed by the shell’s trace stress.
A realistic physical scenario would not have a true discontinuity but rather a steep, finite
gradient in the scalar field at the material boundary. This “thick,” non-singular shell still
contains large but finite stress–energy, and the resulting layer mediates a fifth force on matter
passing through it—an effect already tightly constrained by Equivalence-Principle experiments.

Critique of the Metamaterial Scheme

3.1

Equivalence to Scalar-Tensor Gravity and the Field Equations

Promoting the gravitational coupling to κ(r) is formally equivalent to a Jordan-Brans-Dicketype scalar-tensor theory [6, 7]. In the constant-κ0 case, the Alcubierre line element
2
ds2 = −dt2 + dx − vs f (r) dt + dy 2 + dz 2
(14)
is an exact solution of the standard Einstein field equations, Gµν = κ0 Tµν .
However, once κ0 → κ(x), the underlying theory changes, and the field equations become
significantly more complex. The simplified ansatz Gµν = κ(r)Tµν used in the original analysis
[2, 3] is not a valid field equation. The correct Jordan-Brans-Dicke field equations, written in
the Jordan frame, must account for the scalar field’s own energy and momentum:

A proper analysis must show that a proposed metric can satisfy the full set of equations
above—a much more demanding task for which no closed-form analytic solution analogous to
Alcubierre’s is presently known. The energy density of the scalar field itself is proportional to
the term (∇ϕ)2 . A rapid change in the field across a thin boundary layer creates a concentration
of stress-energy whose magnitude depends on the specific model parameters. For a proposed
warp-drive to be effective, however, the field excursion would need to be large, leading to a
prohibitive energy concentration unless a non-trivial mechanism suppresses it.
Alternatively, after the conformal transformation and scalar field re-definition to transform
to the Einstein frame, the field equations become the standard Einstein equations sourced by a
canonical scalar field φ and the transformed matter fields:

In this frame, matter now couples non-minimally to the metric via an overall factor (e.g.,
e−2αφ g̃µν ), resulting in an explicit “fifth force.”

3.2

The Proposed EM Mechanism

A proposed mechanism [2] rests on the flawed premise of engineering (e.g., via Fröhlich pumping [3]) the gravitational coupling, κ0 = 8πG/c4 , by replacing the invariant speed c with the
metamaterial phase velocity of light, cmeta = c/n(x). The speed c in the Einstein constant is
a constant of nature reflecting the causal structure of spacetime, whereas cmeta is an emergent
property of electromagnetic wave propagation inside matter. The value of c in the gravitational
field equations cannot be altered by engineering a material’s refractive index.
Even setting aside this faulty assumption, any such scheme proposing a non-trivial n(x) ̸= 1
immediately runs into other insurmountable obstacles:
• No Gravitational Dipole Polarization: Electromagnetic metamaterials rely on creating electric or magnetic dipoles. An analogous ‘gravitational polarizability’ is not possible
because all ordinary matter possesses a positive mass (gravitational charge), and there
is no known negative gravitational charge leading to gravitational dipoles. Bondi’s [8]
hypothetical dipole of equal positive and negative masses—whose self-acceleration Bonnor [9] later deemed “preposterous”—still lacks any physically realizable negative-mass
constituent.
• Gravimeter Null Results: Superconducting gravimeters, with long-term stability better than ∼ 10−9 g, detect no anomalies under varying EM fields, directly constraining such
proposed mechanisms [10].
• κ-Modulation: A universal, position-dependent coupling κ(x) violates the Strong Equivalence Principle via the Nordtvedt self-energy effect [11, 12]. Millimetre-precision lunarlaser-ranging (LLR) constrains the corresponding Nordtvedt parameter to |ηN | ≲ 5 ×
10−4 [5, 13]. In the strong-field regime, binary-pulsar timing with the PSR J0337+1715
triple system provides an even tighter bound, |ηN | ≲ 2×10−6 [14,15]. These results already
rule out any scalar coupling strong enough for practical “gravitational metamaterials.”

3.3

Distinction from Analog Gravity Models

It is important to distinguish the proposals critiqued in this paper from the separate field of
analog gravity, where electromagnetic metamaterials are engineered to emulate exotic spacetime
geometries for light waves [16]. In these models, the goal is not to alter gravity itself but to
create a laboratory system in which photons behave as if they propagate in a curved spacetime.
A detailed proposal for an electromagnetic analog of the Alcubierre metric was developed by
Smolyaninov [16]. The mechanism relies on a one-to-one mapping between metric components
and the electromagnetic properties of a medium. For the Alcubierre line element, one must
engineer permittivity ϵ, permeability µ, and a magnetoelectric coupling gx satisfying gx2 ≤
(ϵ − 1) (µ − 1), a thermodynamic stability bound [16]. Even idealized “perfect” metamaterials
that saturate this bound yield a maximum emulated warp speed v0 ≤ 4c .
These are purely electromagnetic mappings and do not correspond to any modification of
the gravitational coupling κ0 in Einstein’s equations. Analog models do not alter the Einstein–Hilbert action or violate the Bianchi identity, and thus they cannot evade the conservation–law or equivalence–principle arguments presented herein.

Other Theoretical Loopholes

4.1

Fifth-Force (Yukawa) Constraints

A spatially varying gravitational coupling inevitably introduces a fifth force that, in the static
and non-relativistic limit, is well described by a Yukawa potential

where the rest masses are defined relativistically by m = c12 T 00 d3 x and G = κ0 c4 /(8π).
Decades of torsion-balance experiments bound the coupling strength to |α| ≲ 10−6 for interaction ranges λ ∼ cm, with comparably tight limits across nearly all scales [17, 18].
V (r) = −

4.2

Screening, Torsion, and EFT

Other potential escapes are also sealed:
• Screening (chameleon, Vainshtein, etc.) requires specific non-linear self-interactions not
present in this simple proposal. Furthermore, many such mechanisms are strongly constrained by laboratory tests, though viable parameter-space windows remain for models
like Vainshtein screening or Damour-Polyakov dilaton screening (see e.g., [19]).
• Torsion in Poincaré Gauge Theories: Torsion, if it exists, couples to intrinsic spin
density, not to bulk dielectric properties like ϵr or µr . Since macroscopic media have
negligible net spin polarization, any effects would be extraordinarily weak. Furthermore,
direct searches and precision tests, such as Gravity Probe B, have placed stringent limits
on any potential axial torsion-spin interactions for the simple models considered, strongly
constraining them as a viable mechanism for this proposal [20].
• Effective Field Theory allows higher-curvature terms like R2 , but these are Plancksuppressed and do not yield a local, variable κ(x).

4.3

Impracticality of Screening Mechanisms

A prominent theoretical avenue to evade stringent fifth-force bounds is via a density-dependent
screening mechanism, as in the chameleon [21] or symmetron [22] models. In this class of
theories, the scalar field ϕ couples to the local matter density ρ, leading to an effective potential
of the form:
ρ
Veff (ϕ) = V (ϕ) + β
ϕ.
(19)
MPl
Here, V (ϕ) is the field’s self-interaction potential, and β is the dimensionless coupling strength
to matter. The field acquires an effective mass given by the curvature of this potential at its
′′ (ϕ
density-dependent minimum, m2eff = Veff
min ). In high-density environments (e.g., Earth’s
atmosphere), the ρ-dependent term dominates, giving the field a large mass and thus a microscopic interaction range, which screens it from detection. To “de-screen” the field and give it
a laboratory-scale range, a “pump” experiment must achieve two technologically demanding
feats:
1. De-screening: Maintain pressures lower than standard ultra-high vacuum (UHV), approaching 10−11 –10−12 torr, as required for many screening models to become active in a
meter-scale apparatus.
2. Resonant Excitation: Drive ϕ at its natural frequency ω ≈ meff c2 /ℏ. To overcome
the ∼ 10−12 post-Newtonian suppression via resonance would require a quality factor
Q ≳ 1012 , implying an illustrative tuning precision of ∆ω/ω ∼ 1/Q ≲ 10−12 .
6

Engineering such conditions appears beyond current capabilities. More fundamentally, any
model with a coupling β strong enough to be detected, even under these ideal circumstances,
is already independently excluded by precision fifth-force searches.

4.4

Aharonov–Bohm–coupled scalar theories

The Jordan-frame scalar–tensor model, coupled to Aharonov–Bohm (A–B) electrodynamics,
proposed by Minotti & Modanese [23] introduces an extra current
I ≡ ∂ν j ν ̸= 0,

(20)

violating local charge conservation and sourcing the A–B scalar
S ≡ ∂ µ Aµ .

(21)

In the weak–field limit, the successive field equations (adopting the − + ++ signature, differing
from the + − −− signature in [23]) are:
∂ν j ν = I =⇒ □S = −µ0 I =⇒ □ϕ = Kϕ S 2 =⇒ □χ = −

c2
□ϕ .
2

The dimensionful coupling constant Kϕ that appears in the field equation □ϕ = Kϕ S 2 and
determines how strongly the Aharonov-Bohm term S 2 acts as a source for the gravitational
scalar field ϕ (itself non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar R) is [23, Eq. (20a)]:
Kϕ =

Cϕ
8πG0 ε0
Cϕ ≃ 1.65 × 10−37
A2 s4 kg−2 m−2 ,
(2ω0 + 3) c2
2ω0 + 3

(22)

where Cϕ is the dimensionless coupling parameter between the gravitational scalar field ϕ and
the A–B scalar S, G0 is Newton’s gravitational constant, ε0 is vacuum’s permittivity, and c is
the vacuum speed of light. The dimensionless Brans-Dicke coupling constant ω0 = ω(ϕ0 ) is its
value evaluated at the vacuum expectation value (VEV) ϕ0 = 1 (the background or weak-field
limit).
1. No controlled macroscopic violation of charge conservation. The theory’s foundation is a source exhibiting local charge non-conservation (I ̸= 0). All verified anomalies
(chiral ABJ, etc.) occur only in microscopic, high–energy settings. The proponents cite theoretical mechanisms for such effects, based on non-equilibrium Green’s functions and tunneling
anomalies in condensed matter systems [24–26]. While these models are plausible at the quantum or mesoscopic scale (e.g., DFT simulations of molecular junctions), they do not provide
a demonstrated pathway for scaling these phenomena into a coherent, tunable current density
over the macroscopic volumes required for a practical warp drive. To date, no such source
has been experimentally realized, leaving the first and most crucial link in the causal chain
unsubstantiated.
2. Tiny gravitational response. For the resonant cylindrical cavity set-up analyzed in
Ref. [23], the mean gravitational axial force (per-unit-mass) fz is [23, Eq. (43)]:
fz =

where γAB is the (dimensionless) current–non-conservation parameter, and h is the height, Q

|Cϕ |needed with ω0 =104 ≳ ≈ 1.40 × 1024 .

evading the Cassini bound), this reduces |Cϕ |needed to
|Cϕ |needed with ω0 =1 ≳ ≈ 3.50 × 1020 .

(27)

The authors approximate Cϕ ≃ ψ0 , which follows from the assumptions that the VEV of the
non-minimally coupled gravitational scalar field ϕ0 = 1 and that the derivative ∂βAB /∂ϕ ∼ 1.
Therefore the requirement is ψ0 ≳ 1020 − 1024 . Here, ψ0 is the VEV of the gravitational scalar
field ψ which is minimally coupled to gravity, contributing to the dynamics via the kinetic
and potential energy, and modulation of matter/AB couplings. And βAB is the dimensionless
function that governs the coupling between the gravitational scalar fields ϕ, ψ and the AharonovBohm electromagnetic sector S.
Current constraints arise from strong-equivalence-principle tests. The most stringent are:
|ηN | ≲ 5 × 10−4

|ηN | ≲ 2 × 10−6

(lunar-laser ranging) [5],

(PSR J0337+1715) [14].

, so the experimental limits imply ω0 ≳
2ω0 + 3
103 –105 . The extended Minotti-Modanese model circumvents this via the material-dependent,
non-minimal coupling βmat (ϕ), which the authors propose fully suppresses long-range effects,
potentially allowing large ψ0 without violation of fifth-force bounds (e.g., torsion-balance |α| <
10−6 at cm scales, where standard α ≈ 1/(2ω0 + 3) ≈ 0.2 for ω0 = 1 would be excluded, but
βmat may make the force short-range or screened).
In Brans–Dicke theory one has ηN ≃

The proponents attribute experimental non-observation to γAB being extremely small in ordinary materials, suggesting that specialized materials could enhance it, with experiments by
Poher (high-voltage discharges) [27] and Podkletnov (impulsive discharges through superconductors) [28] as potentially indicative. Even adopting an optimistic value of γAB = 0.15, this
presents a serious problem. This γAB = 0.15 value exceeds known quantum anomaly coefficients
by more than two orders of magnitude, and moreover, there is no experimental evidence for
current non-conservation at macroscopic scales. For comparison, the Adler–Bell–Jackiw (microscopic quantum) anomaly is suppressed by a factor γAB ∼ 0.001, as discussed in [29]. Under
this assumption, the required value of |Cϕ | remains extremely large: ≳ 1020 –1024 , as calculated
above. By contrast, achieving effects with a modest Cϕ ∼ 1 would demand an unphysical value
8

of γAB ∼ 3×109 . This is far too large for a parameter intended to capture subtle, loop-suppressed
anomalies that arise only in chiral, microscopic quantum contexts.
Moreover, the cited experiments are controversial: Podkletnov’s claims of anomalous forces
have resisted replication, both for his earlier gravity-shielding experiment involving rotating
superconductors [30, 31] and for the superconducting gravity-impulse generator relevant here
[32]. Poher’s impulsive effects similarly lack independent verification in peer-reviewed studies,
with a recent 2024 replication attempt inconclusive [33]. Thus, while material enhancements
are a plausible hypothesis, they do not resolve the core issue of the model’s extreme suppression
or the fine-tuning required for βmat (ϕ) to evade constraints at multiple scales.
In summary, even under the most favorable laboratory parameters and optimistic theoretical
assumptions (such as ω0 ∼ 1 and γAB = 0.15), the model requires a dimensionless coupling on
the order of 1020 to produce a meaningful gravitational effect. The authors’ hypothesis is that a
material-dependent, non-minimal coupling βmat (ϕ) in the matter action, Sm [ gµν , Ψm ; βmat (ϕ) ],
could modify the effective scalar interaction, making it short-ranged. This would allow the theory to evade long-range solar-system constraints (effectively making ωeff ≫ 104 at astronomical
distances) while permitting a large local coupling inside a laboratory device.
However, this proposed solution creates a severe new challenge: it must simultaneously satisfy
stringent constraints at two different scales. While the screening is designed to pass longrange tests, the enormous underlying coupling required for propulsion would still manifest as a
powerful new force at the centimeter-to-meter scale of the experiment itself. Such anomalous
short-range forces are tightly constrained by decades of high-precision torsion-balance experiments. The proposed mechanism must therefore be fine-tuned to an extraordinary degree: it
must be strong enough to suppress the interaction to pass solar-system tests, yet simultaneously
behave in such a way that it does not produce a detectable signal in sensitive laboratory-scale
fifth-force searches, all while permitting the desired propulsive effect. The authors provide no
precise model for a mechanism capable of satisfying these opposing requirements. This requirement for an implausibly fine-tuned mechanism mirrors the authors’ own acknowledgment that
their estimates are “in agreement with the absence of measurable forces in the experiments
reported.”
3. Persistent suppression of gravitational effects. The “soliton–like” solution in [23]
relies on a source I(t) that is non-zero for all past times t < 0, implying a field that has
always existed. Any attempt to switch on such a field in finite laboratory time necessarily
radiates energy and destroys the static assumption. The authors suggest an asymmetric resonant
cavity as a more relevant geometry, and in this case, the boundary conditions appear physical:
the setup assumes a steady-state harmonic regime in a bounded region, with S = 0 outside,
achievable by powering a cavity resonator to equilibrium. However, the fundamental challenge of
magnitude remains—in this or any setup, the field equations locally reduce to □ϕ = Kϕ S 2 , with
the resulting field amplitude (e.g., enhanced by Q in a cavity) still proportional to the extremely
small coupling Kϕ , requiring an enhancement of > 20 orders of magnitude via implausibly large
Cϕ or other parameters like γAB , as established in the preceding analysis.
Conclusion. A–B coupling bypasses the stress–energy channel ruled out in Sec. 2, but only by
invoking:
(i) an unverified macroscopic violation of charge conservation;
(ii) a fundamental interaction suppressed by both the weakness of the gravitational effect and
2 ), which kills any realistic effect; and
the smallness of the non-conservation parameter (γAB
(iii) parameter regimes requiring enhancements of over 20 orders of magnitude in couplings or
non-conservation factors, which are implausible and unverified in laboratory settings.
9

Hence, at the present time, this interesting proposal offers no viable low–power route to a
warp–drive–like metric.

Summary of Experimental Constraints

Planetary-scale tests of gravity have been conducted using deep space probes. NASA’s Galileo
spacecraft, for instance, performed multiple close flybys of Jupiter’s moon Europa. By precisely
analyzing the spacecraft’s trajectory from radio-Doppler data, scientists were able to determine Europa’s gravitational field with high precision [34]. The results were fully consistent
with standard gravitational theory and provided key evidence for Europa’s internal inhomogeneous structure, including its external icy shell and subsurface ocean, without any detection of
anomalous gravitational effects.
A space- or time-dependent gravitational coupling would entail (i) a composition-dependent
fifth force or (ii) self-energy–dependent accelerations that violate the Strong Equivalence Principle. Decades of high-precision torsion-balance, lunar-laser-ranging, spacecraft-tracking, and
pulsar-timing experiments (Table 1) have detected no such effects, setting stringent bounds on
departures from General Relativity.

Scope and Intent
This note is not intended as a personal critique of any individual, but rather as a rigorous,
technical assessment of any model in which the Einstein coupling is promoted to a materialdependent and hence position-dependent scalar field κ(x). By surveying the mathematical
structure, junction conditions, and modern experimental bounds, our goal is to clarify once and
for all which obstacles must be surmounted before a viable “low-energy warp-drive” or similar
scheme can be constructed.

Conclusions

The proposal of a “low-energy warp drive” via a material-dependent gravitational coupling faces
significant challenges that render it unworkable with known physics, as it is inconsistent with
multiple, independent theoretical principles and experimental constraints:
1. Energy–momentum conservation. A prescribed, non-dynamical κ(x) violates ∇µ T µν =
0; promoting it to a scalar–tensor field predicts |γ − 1| ≃ 1/(2 + ω) and a Nordtvedt acceleration ∆a/a ∼ (Uself /mc2 )/(2 + ω), both already excluded by Solar-System and pulsar
tests (|γ − 1| ≲ 2 × 10−5 ).

2. Junction conditions. Any discontinuous jump in κ produces a δ-function layer of
stress–energy at a material boundary; even graded profiles act as a Yukawa-type fifth
force. Torsion-balance experiments constrain this force (e.g., to |α| ≲ 1.8 × 10−2 at
λ = 1 cm), with other tight limits set by LLR and spacecraft Doppler data.
3. Flawed metamaterial mechanism. The proposed electromagnetic route conflates the
invariant speed c in κ0 = 8πG/c4 with a medium’s refractive index n. Electromagnetic
metamaterials rely on electric or magnetic dipole polarization, but gravity lacks negativemass charges, so no known material response can generate a local, tunable κ(x).
4. Post-Newtonian suppression. Time-dependent or resonant “pump” effects enter only
at O[(v/c)2 ] in Brans–Dicke–like models, making laboratory amplification schemes impractical except in highly fine-tuned self-interacting scenarios.
5. No viable metric solution. Introducing κ(x) invalidates the Alcubierre geometry; no
analytic warp-drive metric is known in scalar–tensor gravity, and Cassini’s |γ − 1| <
2.3 × 10−5 (ω ≳ 4.3 × 104 ) limits any κ-variation to be orders of magnitude too small for
propulsion relevance.
