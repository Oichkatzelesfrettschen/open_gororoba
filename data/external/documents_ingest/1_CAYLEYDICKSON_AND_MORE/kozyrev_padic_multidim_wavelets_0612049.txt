Abstract. In this paper we study some problems related with the theory
of multidimensional p-adic wavelets in connection with the theory of multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators (in the p-adic Lizorkin
space). We introduce a new class of n-dimensional p-adic compactly supported wavelets. In one-dimensional case this class includes the Kozyrev
p-adic wavelets. These wavelets (and their Fourier transforms) form an orthonormal complete basis in L2 (Qnp ). A criterion for a multidimensional
p-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is
derived. We prove that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the Taibleson fractional operator. Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential
operators (fractional operator), these results can be intensively used in applications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets are used to construct solutions of
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations.

1. Introduction
There are a lot of papers where different applications of p-adic analysis to
physical problems, stochastics, cognitive sciences and psychology are studied [6]– [10], [13]– [19], [30]– [32] (see also the references therein).
The field Qp of p-adic numbers is defined as the completion of the field of
rational numbers Q with respect to the non-Archimedean p-adic norm | · |p .
This norm is defined as follows: |0|p = 0; if an arbitrary rational number x 6= 0
is represented as x = pγ m
, where γ = γ(x) ∈ Z, and m and n are not divisible
n
by p, then |x|p = p−γ . This norm in Qp satisfies the strong triangle inequality
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p , |y|p).
It is known that for the p-adic analysis related to the mapping Qp → C,
where C is the field of complex numbers, the operation of partial differentiation
is not defined , and as a result, large number of models connected with p-adic

differential equations use pseudo-differential operators and the theory of padic distributions (generalized functions) (see the above mentioned papers and
books). In particular, fractional operators D α = f−α ∗ are extensively used,
where fα is the p-adic Riesz kernel , ∗ is a convolution. However, in general,
D α ϕ 6∈ D(Qnp ) for ϕ ∈ D(Qnp ), where D(Qnp ) is the space of test functions.
Consequently, the operation D α f is well defined only for some distributions
fR ∈ D ′ (Qnp ). For example, D −1 is defined only on the test functions such that
ϕ(x) dx = 0 [30, IX.2].
Qp
We recall that similar problems arise for the “C-case” fractional operators
(where all functions and distributions are complex or real valued defined on
spaces with real or complex coordinates): in general, the Schwartzian test
function space S(Rn ) is not invariant under fractional operators [26], [27]. To
solve this problem, in the excellent papers of P. I. Lizorkin [24], [25] a new type
spaces invariant under fractional operators were introduced (see also [26], [27]).
Taking into account the problems mentioned above, in [3], the p-adic Lizorkin spaces of test functions and distributions were introduced, and in [3], [4]
a class of pseudo-differential operators (including the Taibleson fractional operator) defined on them was constructed. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant
under our pseudo-differential operators, and consequently, these spaces are
their “natural” definition domains and can play a key role in considerations
related to the fractional operators problems.
Recall that for the one-dimensional case the orthonormal complete basis
of eigenfunctions (5.5) of the Vladimirov operator D α was constructed by
S. V. Kozyrev [20]. The eigenfunctions (5.5) are p-adic compactly supported
wavelets. Further development and generalization of the theory of such type
wavelets can be found in the papers by S. V. Kozyrev [21], [22], A. Yu. Khrennikov, and S. V. Kozyrev [16], [17], J. J. Benedetto, and R. L. Benedetto [8],
and R. L. Benedetto [9].
It is typical that such type p-adic compactly supported wavelets are eigenfunctions of p-adic pseudo-differential
operators. Moreover, these wavelets
R
satisfy the condition Qp ϕ(x) dx = 0 (see [20]), and, in view of Lemma 3.1,
belong to the Lizorkin space Φ(Qp ). In [3], there waqs derived the necessary
and sufficient condition for multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators to have such type multidimensional wavelets as eigenfunctions. Thus the
wavelets theory play a key role in p-adic analysis.
Contents of the paper. In this paper problems related with the theory of
multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators and the theory of multidimensional p-adic wavelets are studied. Here the results of our paper [3] are
intensively used.
In Sec. 2, we recall some facts from the p-adic theory of distributions [12],
[28], [29], [30]. In Sec. 3, some facts from the theory of the p-adic Lizorkin

spaces [3] are recalled. In Sec. 4, we recall some facts on the multidimensional pseudo-differential operators defined in the Lizorkin space of distributions D ′ (Qnp ). The fractional Taibleson operator [28, §2], [29, III.4.] is among
them. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant under our pseudo-differential operators. It is appropriate to mention here that the class of our operators includes
the pseudo-differential operators studied in [19], [33], [34].
In Sec. 5, a new type of p-adic compactly supported wavelets (in one- dimensional (5.3) and multidimensional (5.17) cases) are introduced. These
wavelets belong to the Lizorkin space of test functions. The Kozyrev onedimensional wavelets [20] (see (5.5)) is a particular case of our one-dimensional
wavelets (5.3). The scaling function of wavelets (5.3) is a characteristic function of the unit disc. The two-scale equation (5.7) for these wavelets is presented. However, in this paper the multiresolution analysis is not considered.
The one-dimensional wavelets (5.3) and multidimensional wavelets (5.17) form
orthonormal complete bases in L2 (Qp ) and L2 (Qnp ), respectively (see Theorems 5.1, 5.2). Their Fourier transforms also form orthonormal complete bases
in L2 (Qp ) and L2 (Qnp ), respectively (see Corollary 5.1, 5.2).
In Sec. 6, the spectral theory of our pseudo-differential operators is constructed. By Theorem 6.1 the criterion (6.1) for multidimensional p-adic
pseudo-differential operators (3.2) to have multidimensional wavelets (5.17) as
eigenfunctions is derived. In particular, the multidimensional wavelets (5.17)
are eigenfunctions of the Taibleson fractional operator (see (6.6)).
Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential operators, in particular,
fractional operator, these results on p-adic wavelets can be intensively used in
applications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets can be used to construct solutions of
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations [5], [18], [23].
2. p-Adic distributions
Now we recall some facts from the theory of p-adic distributions (generalized
functions). We shall systematically use the notations and results from [30]. Let
N, Z, C be the sets of positive integers, integers, complex numbers, respectively.
Denote by Q∗p = Qp \ {0} the multiplicative group of the field Qp . The space
Qnp = Qp × · · · × Qp consists of points x = (x1 , . . . , xn ), where xj ∈ Qp ,
j = 1, 2 . . . , n, n ≥ 2. The p-adic norm on Qnp is
(2.1)

|x|p = max |xj |p ,
1≤j≤n

x ∈ Qnp .

Denote by Bγn (a) = {x : |x − a|p ≤ pγ } the ball of radius pγ with the center
at a point a = (a1 , . . . , an ) ∈ Qnp and by Sγn (a) = {x : |x − a|p = pγ } =
n
Bγn (a) \ Bγ−1
(a) its boundary (sphere), γ ∈ Z. For a = 0 we set Bγn (0) = Bγn
n
and Sγ (0) = Sγn . For the case n = 1 we will omit the upper index n. Here
(2.2)

Bγn (a) = Bγ (a1 ) × · · · × Bγ (an ),

4

A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH

where Bγ (aj ) = {xj : |xj − aj |p ≤ pγ } is a disc of radius pγ with the center at
a point aj ∈ Qp , j = 1, 2 . . . , n. Any two balls in Qnp either are disjoint or one
contains the other. Every point of the ball is its center.
According to [30, I.3,Examples 1,2.], the disc Bγ is represented by the sum
′
of pγ−γ disjoint discs Bγ ′ (a), γ ′ < γ:
Bγ = Bγ ′ ∪ ∪a Bγ ′ (a),

(2.3)

′

where a = 0 and a = a−r p−r + a−r+1 p−r+1 + · · · + a−γ ′ −1 p−γ −1 are the centers
of the discs Bγ ′ (a), r = γ, γ − 1, γ − 2, . . . , γ ′ + 1, 0 ≤ aj ≤ p − 1, a−r 6= 0.
In particular, the disc B0 is represented by the sum of p disjoint discs
B0 = B−1 ∪ ∪p−1
r=1 B−1 (r),

(2.4)

where B−1 (r) = {x ∈ S0 : x0 = r} = r + pZp , r = 1, . . . , p − 1; B−1 = {|x|p ≤
p−1 } = pZp ; and S0 = {|x|p = 1} = ∪p−1
r=1 B−1 (r). Here all the discs are disjoint.
We call covering (2.3), (2.4) the canonical covering of the disc B0 .
A complex-valued function f defined on Qnp is called locally-constant if for
any x ∈ Qnp there exists an integer l(x) ∈ Z such that
f (x + y) = f (x),

n
y ∈ Bl(x)
.

Let E(Qnp ) and D(Qnp ) be the linear spaces of locally-constant C-valued
functions on Qnp and locally-constant C-valued functions with compact supports (so-called test functions), respectively; D(Qp ), E(Qp ) [30, VI.1.,2.]. If
ϕ ∈ D(Qnp ), according to Lemma 1 from [30, VI.1.], there exists l ∈ Z, such
that
ϕ(x + y) = ϕ(x), y ∈ Bln , x ∈ Qnp .
The largest of such numbers l = l(ϕ) is called the parameter of constancy of
l
the function ϕ. Let us denote by DN
(Qnp ) the finite-dimensional space of test
n
functions from D(Qnp ) having supports in the ball BN
and with parameters of
′
n
constancy ≥ l [30, VI.2.]. Denote by D (Qp ) the set of all linear functionals
on D(Qnp ) [30, VI.3.].
Let us introduce in D(Qnp ) a canonical δ-sequence δk (x) = pnk Ω(pk |x|p ), and
a canonical 1-sequence ∆k (x) = Ω(p−k |x|p ), k ∈ Z, x ∈ Qnp , where

1,
0 ≤ t ≤ 1,
(2.5)
Ω(t) =

Here ∆k (x) is the characteristic function of the ball Bkn . It is clear [30, VI.3.,
VII.1.] that δk → δ, k → ∞ in D ′ (Qnp ) and ∆k → 1, k → ∞ in E(Qnp ).
The Fourier transform of ϕ ∈ D(Qnp ) is defined by the formula

F [ϕ](ξ) =
χp (ξ · x)ϕ(x) dn x, ξ ∈ Qnp ,

where χp (ξ · x) = e2πi j=1 {ξj xj }p ; ξ · x is the scalar product of vectors; the

(2.6) {x}p =

The Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism D(Qnp ) into D(Qnp ). Moreover,
according to [28, Lemma A.], [29, III,(3.2)], [30, VII.2.],

We define the Fourier transform F [f ] of a distribution f ∈ D ′ (Qnp ) by the
relation [30, VII.3.]:
(2.8)

hF [f ], ϕi = hf, F [ϕ]i,

∀ ϕ ∈ D(Qnp ).

Let A be a matrix and b ∈ Qnp . Then for a distribution f ∈ D ′ (Qnp ) the

(2.10)

F [∆k ](x) = δk (x),

k ∈ Z,

x ∈ Qnp .

In particular, F [Ω(|ξ|p )](x) = Ω(|x|p ).
The convolution f ∗ g for distributions f, g ∈ D ′(Qnp ) is defined (see [30,
VII.1.]) as
(2.11)

hf ∗ g, ϕi = lim hf (x) × g(y), ∆k (x)ϕ(x + y)i
k→∞

if the limit exists for all ϕ ∈ D(Qnp ), where f (x) × g(y) is the direct product
of distributions. If for distributions f, g ∈ D ′ (Qnp ) the convolution f ∗ g exists
then [30, VII,(5.4)]
(2.12)

F [f ∗ g] = F [f ]F [g].

It is well known (see, e.g., [30, III.2.]) that any multiplicative character π of
the field Qp can be represented as
def

π(x) = πα (x) = |x|α−1
π1 (x),
p

x ∈ Qp ,

where π(p) = p1−α and π1 (x) is a normed multiplicative character such that
π1 (x) = π1 (|x|p x), π1 (p) = π1 (1) = 1, |π1 (x)| = 1. We denote π0 = |x|−1
p .
Definition 2.1. Let πα be a multiplicative character of the field Qp .
(a) According to [1], [2], a distribution fm ∈ D ′ (Qp ) is said to be associated

and

(c) An associated homogeneous distribution (in the wide sense) of order
m = 1 is called associated homogeneous distribution (see [11] and [1], [2]).
(d) An associated homogeneous distribution of degree πα and order m = 0
is called homogeneous distribution of degree πα , i.e.,

3. The p-adic Lizorkin spaces
Let us introduce the p-adic Lizorkin space of test functions
Φ(Qnp ) = {φ : φ = F [ψ], ψ ∈ Ψ(Qnp )},
where
Ψ(Qnp ) = {ψ(ξ) ∈ D(Qnp ) : ψ(0) = 0}.
Here Ψ(Qnp ), Φ(Qnp ) ⊂ D(Qnp ). The space Φ(Qnp ) can be equipped with the
topology of the space D(Qnp ) which makes Φ(Qnp ) a complete space.
In view of (2.7), the following lemma holds.

.

In fact, for n = 1, this lemma was proved in [30, IX.2.]. Unlike the classical
Lizorkin space, any function ψ(ξ) ∈ Φ(Qnp ) is equal to zero not only at ξ = 0
but in a ball B n ∋ 0, as well.

A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH

Let Φ′ (Qnp ) denote the topological dual of the space Φ(Qnp ). We call it the
p-adic Lizorkin space of distributions.
By Ψ⊥ and Φ⊥ we denote the subspaces of functionals in D ′ (Qnp ) orthogonal
to Ψ(Qnp ) and Φ(Qnp ), respectively. Thus Ψ⊥ = {f ∈ D ′ (Qnp ) : f = Cδ, C ∈ C}
and Φ⊥ = {f ∈ D ′ (Qnp ) : f = C, C ∈ C}.
Proposition 3.1. ( [3])
Φ′ (Qnp ) = D ′ (Qnp )/Φ⊥ ,

Ψ′ (Qnp ) = D ′ (Qnp )/Ψ⊥ .

The space Φ′ (Qnp ) can be obtained from D ′ (Qnp ) by “sifting out” constants.
Thus two distributions in D ′ (Qnp ) differing by a constant are indistinguishable
as elements of Φ′ (Qnp ).
Similarly to (2.8), we define the Fourier transforms of distributions f ∈
Φ′× (Qnp ) and g ∈ Ψ′× (Qnp ) by the relations:
(3.2)

hF [f ], ψi = hf, F [ψ]i,

∀ ψ ∈ Ψ(Qnp ),

hF [g], φi = hg, F [φ]i,

∀ φ ∈ Φ(Qnp ).

By definition, F [Φ(Qnp )] = Ψ(Qnp ) and F [Ψ(Qnp )] = Φ(Qnp ), i.e., (3.2) give well
defined objects.

Lemma 4.1. The Lizorkin space Φ(Qnp ) is invariant under the pseudo- differential operators (4.1). Moreover, A(Φ(Qnp )) = Φ(Qnp ).
Proof. In view of (2.7) and results of Sec. 3, functions F [φ](ξ) and A(ξ)F [φ](ξ)
belong to Ψ(Qnp ), and, consequently, (Aφ)(x) ∈ Φ(Qnp ), i.e., A(Φ(Qnp )) ⊂
Φ(Qnp ). Thus the pseudo-differential operators (4.1) are well defined, and the
Lizorkin space Φ(Qnp ) is invariant under them. Moreover, any function from
Ψ(Qnp ) can be represented as ψ(ξ) = A(ξ)ψ1 (ξ), ψ1 ∈ Ψ(Qnp ). This implies
that A(Φ(Qnp )) = Φ(Qnp ).

then one can define the operator A in the Lizorkin space of distributions: for
f ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ) we have
(4.3)

hAf, φi = hf, AT φi,

∀ φ ∈ Φ(Qnp ).

It is clear that
(4.4)

Af = F −1 [A F [f ]] ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ),

i.e., the Lizorkin space of distributions Φ′ (Qnp ) is invariant under pseudodifferential operators A. Moreover, in view of Lemma 4.1, A(Φ′ (Qnp )) =
Φ′ (Qnp ).
If A, B are pseudo-differential operators with symbols A(ξ), B(ξ) ∈ E(Qnp \
{0}), respectively, then the operator AB is well defined and represented by
the formula
(AB)f = F −1 [AB F [f ]] ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ).
If A(ξ) 6= 0, ξ ∈ Qnp \{0} then we define the inverse pseudo-differential operator
by the formula
A−1 f = F −1 [A−1 F [f ]], f ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ).
Thus the family of pseudo-differential operators A with symbols A(ξ) 6= 0,
ξ ∈ Qnp \ {0} forms an Abelian group.
If the symbol A(ξ) of the operator A is a homogeneous or an associated
homogeneous function (see Definition 2.1) then the pseudo-differential operator
A is called homogeneous or associated homogeneous.
4.2. The Taibleson fractional operator. Let us consider a pseudo- differential operator Dxα with the symbol A(ξ) = |ξ|αp. Thus, according to (4.1),

In view of formulas (2.12), (2.16), (2.17), the relation (4.5) can be rewritten

Using (2.13), (2.17), (4.6), and taking into account (3.1) (for details, see [3],

With the help of (2.16), (4.7), (4.8), it is easy to see that
(4.9)

κα (x) ∗ κβ (x) = κα+β (x),

α, β ∈ C,

holds in the sense of the Lizorkin space Φ′ (Qnp ).
In view of (4.7), (4.8), the multi-dimensional Taibleson operator on the
Lizorkin space of test functions is defined for all α ∈ C as

def
(4.10)
Dxα φ (x) = κ−α (x) ∗ φ(x) = hκ−α (x), φ(x − ξ)i, x ∈ Qnp ,

where φ ∈ Φ(Qnp ).
If α 6= n then the Riesz kernel κα (x) is a homogeneous distribution of degree α − n, and if α = n then the Riesz kernel is an associated homogeneous
distribution of degree 0 and order 1 (see Definitions 2.1,(b),(d)). Thus the
Taibleson fractional operator Dxα , α 6= −n is a homogeneous pseudo-differential
operator of degree α, and Dx−n is an associated homogeneous pseudo-differential
operator of degree −n and order 1 with the symbol A(ξ) = P (|ξ|−n
p ) (see
(2.15)).
According to Lemma 4.1, the Lizorkin space Φ(Qnp ) is invariant under the
Taibleson fractional operator Dxα and Dxα (Φ(Qnp )) = Φ(Qnp ) [3].
In view of (4.2), (4.3), (Dxα )T = Dxα and for f ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ) we have
(4.11)

def

hDxα f, φi = hf, Dxα φi,

∀ φ ∈ Φ(Qnp ).

It is clear that Dxα (Φ′ (Qnp )) = Φ′ (Qnp ). Moreover, in view of (4.9), the family
of operators Dxα , α ∈ C on the Lizorkin space forms an Abelian group: if
f ∈ Φ′ (Qnp ) then Dxα Dxβ f = Dxβ Dxα f = Dxα+β f , Dxα Dx−α f = f , α, β ∈ C.
5. p-Adic wavelets

This set can be identified with the factor group Qp /Zp . Let

sj = 0, 1, . . . , p − 1; j = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1; s0 6= 0},

where m ≥ 1 is a fixed positive integer.

Thus, in view of Theorem 5.1 (see below), one can see that the functions (5.3)
are p-adic wavelets. Moreover, according to (5.4) and Lemma 3.1, the functions
(m)
θγsa (x) belong to the Lizorkin space Φ(Qp ).
It is clear that for any γ ∈ Z and s ∈ Jp;m the functions (5.4) are periodical
with the periods Tγs ∈ pm−γ Zp .
In the case m = 1, i.e., for s = p−1 j, j = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1 these wavelets
coincide with the Kozyrev wavelets [20]:


(1)
In particular, θs (x) = θj (x) = χp (p−1 jx)Ω |x|p for j = 1. Since |x|p ≤ 1,
x ∈ Qp , i.e., x = x0 + x1 p + x2 p2 + · · · , we have p−1 x = p−1 x0 + x1 + x2 p + · · · ,
i.e., the fractional part (2.6) of a number p−1 x is equal to {p−1 x}p = p−1 x0 .

Now we consider θs (x) = θj (x) = χp (p−1 jx)Ω |x|p . Since |jx|p ≤ 1,
x ∈ Qp , we have jx = y0 + y1 p + y2 p2 + · · · , p−1 jx = p−1 y0 + y1 + y2 p + · · · ,
and {p−1 jx}p = p−1 y0 (see (2.6)). Thus,

In the same way we consider the function θs (x) = χp (sx)Ω |x|p , s ∈ Jp;m.
Let B0 = ∪a B−m (a) ∪ B−m be the canonical covering (2.3) of the disc B0 with
pm discs, m ≥ 1, where a = 0 and a = ar pr + ar+1 pr+1 + · · · + am−1 pm−1 is
the center of the discs B−m and B−m (a), respectively, r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , m − 1,
0 ≤ aj ≤ p − 1, ar 6= 0.

For x ∈ B−m (a), s ∈ Jp;m , we have x = a + pm y0 + y1 p + y2 p2 + · · · ,

Parseval formula [30, VII,(4.1)].
6. p-Adic wavelets as eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential
operators

6.1. Pseudo-differential operators. As mentioned above, the one- dimensional Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) introduced in [20] is a particular case of the
wavelets (5.3) for m = 1. Moreover, in [20] S. V. Kozyrev proved that his
wavelets (5.5) are eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional Vladimirov operator
D α for α > 0:
D α θγja (x) = pα(1−γ) θγja (x), x ∈ Qp ,
where γ ∈ Z, a ∈ Ip , j = 1, 2, . . . p − 1. Later, it was proved in [3, 4.4.] that in
fact, the Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) are eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator
for any α, i.e., the above formula holds for all α ∈ C.
Now we prove that n-dimensional wavelets (5.17) are eigenfunctions for a
class of pseudo-differential operators (4.1), which includes the Taibleson fractional operator (4.10), (4.6).
Theorem 6.1. Let A be a pseudo-differential operator with a symbol A(ξ) ∈
E(Qnp \ {0}). Then the n-dimensional p-adic wavelet (5.17) is an eigenfunction
