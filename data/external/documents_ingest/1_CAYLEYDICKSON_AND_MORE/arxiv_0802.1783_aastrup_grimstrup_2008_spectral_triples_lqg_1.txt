                                                 This paper establishes a link between Noncommutative Geometry
                                             and canonical quantum gravity. A semi-finite spectral triple over a
                                             space of connections is presented. The triple involves an algebra of
                                             holonomy loops and a Dirac type operator which resembles a global
                                             functional derivation operator. The interaction between the Dirac op-
                                             erator and the algebra reproduces the Poisson structure of General
                                             Relativity. Moreover, the associated Hilbert space corresponds, up to
                                             a discrete symmetry group, to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism in-
                                             variant states known from Loop Quantum Gravity. Correspondingly,
                                             the square of the Dirac operator has, in terms of canonical quantum
                                             gravity, the form of a global area-squared operator. Furthermore, the
                                             spectral action resembles a partition function of Quantum Gravity.
                                             The construction is background independent and is based on an in-
                                             ductive system of triangulations. This paper is the first of two papers
                                             on the subject.

1     Introduction
Ever since the discovery of the Standard Model of Particle Physics physicists
have worked to understand the apparently arbitrary structure of this the-
ory. Natures choice of gauge group, the Higgs sector, the 20-30 apparently
unrelated parameters etc. almost begs for a deeper explanation.
    With the pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the Standard
Model [1]-[8] such an explanation now appears to emerge. In Connes’ work
the Standard Model coupled to General Relativity is expressed as a single
gravitational theory. The language used for this unification is Noncommu-
tative Geometry [1]. Within this framework, and under a few mathematical
assumptions, the Standard Model coupled to gravity can be shown to be
almost unique [7, 8].
    Noncommutative Geometry is based on the result [1, 9] that Riemannian
spin geometry has an equivalent formulation in terms of commutative -


                                       3
algebras and Dirac operators. In this formulation it is the Dirac operator that
carries metric information of the underlying manifold which is now written
as the spectrum of the -algebra. In total, a Riemannian spin geometry can
be described in terms of a spectral triple which is the collection pB, H, D q of
the algebra B, the Dirac operator D and the Hilbert space H which carries
a representation and action of B and D. To obtain equivalence the triple is
required to satisfy a set of axioms of Noncommutative Geometry.
    The language of spectral triples has a natural generalisation which in-
cludes also noncommutative -algebras and corresponding Dirac type opera-
tors. It is this generalisation which leads to the aforementioned formulation
of the Standard Model. It turns out that the classical action of the Standard
Model coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action emerges from a spectral action
principle applied to a specific spectral triple [3, 4, 5]. This triple involves
an almost commutative -algebra which is an algebra that factorises into a
commutative part times a matrix factor. This means that the classical action
describing all fundamental physics4 emerges from an asymptotic expansion
of the spectral action                    ¸
                              TrφpD̃{λq     λ n cn .
Here D̃ denotes the Dirac type operator D subjected to certain inner fluc-
tuations stemming from the noncommutativity of the algebra. Without the
matrix factor, that is, for a commutative -algebra, the same expression leads
to the Einstein-Hilbert action alone. Thus, it is the inclusion of noncommuta-
tive -algebras in the language of spectral triples that permits the formulation
of all fundamental forces and particles in terms of pure gravity.
    This success of Noncommutative Geometry as a framework to describe
fundamental physics in a unified manner raises, however, a fundamental ques-
tion regarding quantization. The Standard Model by itself is a quantum
field theory. However, in its noncommutative formulation it arises as an
integrated part of a purely gravitational theory. This theory is essentially
classical. Quantum Field Theory enters the construction in a secondary step
where the spectral action has been expanded in a gravitational sector involv-
ing only the metric field and a matter sector including all the fermionic and
bosonic fields of the Standard Model. Quantization is applied to the latter
sector only.
    So this is the question: how does the quantization procedure of Quantum
Field Theory fit into the language of Noncommutative Geometry? Since the
  4
      Here we give the bosonic part only.

                                            4
structure of the Standard Model is so readily translated into the language of
Noncommutative Geometry one would expect also Quantum Field Theory to
have a corresponding translation. This question is further complicated by the
intrinsic gravitational nature of Connes’ formulation of the Standard Model.
If a notion of quantization does exist within this framework one would expect
this to involve, at some level, Quantum Gravity.
    This paper is motivated by these considerations. We wish to address the
question regarding the inclusion of the quantization procedure in the general
framework of Noncommutative Geometry and, in particular, in the noncom-
mutative formulation of the Standard Model. We start the investigation with
the assumption that the answer will involve some notion of Quantum Grav-
ity. Thus, to guide our intuition we consult first canonical quantum gravity
and one of its modern trends known as Loop Quantum Gravity [11]-[15].
    Loop Quantum Gravity is an approach to non-perturbative Quantum
Gravity which is based on a formulation of General Relativity in terms of
Ashtekar variables [16, 17]. These variables include the Ashtekar connection
and its conjugate variable, the inverse densitised dreibein. In Loop Quantum
Gravity one takes as the classical phase space variables the holonomy loop
of the Ashtekar connection and its conjugate, a certain flux vector. These
variables are then used in a Dirac-type quantization procedure. This involves
the representation of the corresponding Poisson structure on a kinematical
Hilbert space as well as the formulation of constraints encoding the sym-
metries of the classical theory. Here, the holonomy loops are represented
as multiplication operators. This means that the kinematical Hilbert space
involves functions over a space of connections.
    On a technical level, Loop Quantum Gravity exploits the holonomy-
formulation of gravity to recast the problem of quantizing gravity in terms
of a inductive system of graphs. It turns out that the space of connections,
when seen in terms of holonomies restricted to a specific graph, is a mani-
fold. This manifold is related to the gauge group which, in the case of Loop
Quantum Gravity, is SU p2q. This means that the space of connections itself
is a pro-manifold, the projective limit of manifolds. This, in turn, permits a
formulation of the quantization procedure on the level of finite graphs whose
complexity are subsequently increased infinitely. This construction is due to
Ashtekar and Lewandowski [18, 19].
    In this paper we aim to construct a model which involves elements of
both Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Gravity. We use two central
elements of Loop Quantum Gravity to obtain such a model. First, the fact

                                      5
that gravity can be formulated in terms of Wilson loops leads us to consider
a spectral triple which involves an algebra of holonomy loops. These loop
variables serve as functions on an underlying space of connections. Second,
we wish to exploit the pro-manifold structure of the space of connections to
describe the algebra of loops and to construct a Dirac type operator on the
space of connections. This means that we aim to construct a spectral triple
over each manifold associated to graphs in the projective system. These
spectral triples are required to be compatible with all embeddings between
graphs. This requirement will ensure that the limit where the complexity of
graphs is increased infinitely gives rise to a limit spectral triple.
    This program was initiated first in [20] (see also [21]) where the authors
attempted to construct such a spectral triple. There the authors found that
the inductive system of graphs used in Loop Quantum Gravity, which is the
system of all piecewise analytic graphs, is too large to permit a Dirac type
operator on the space of connections. Technically, the multitude of possible
embedding of different graphs was found to be too large for a Dirac type
operator compatible with all embeddings to exist.
    In the present paper we return to this problem to consider now different
systems of embedded graphs. In particular, we study the countable system of
embedded graphs given by a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions.
It turns out that this restricted system of graphs does permit a Dirac type
operator on the associated projective system of manifolds. Furthermore, we
find that the limit of infinitely many barycentric subdivisions gives us an
accurate description of the full space of connections as well as the associated
algebra of holonomy loops. The construction is general and only assumes the
gauge group G to be compact.
    What we obtain is the following. Given a triangulation T and a compact
Lie group G, we construct a spectral triple
                              pB , D, Hq ,                              (1)
where B is the -algebra of holonomy loops obtained via the inductive system
of triangulations. The algebra is represented on the separable Hilbert space
H which carries an action of the Dirac type operator D . If we denote by A
the space of smooth connections in a trivial principal bundle M  G, where
M is a manifold which corresponds to the triangulation T , then we find
that A is densely contained in the pro-manifold associated to the algebra B .
This means that the spectral triple (1) is a geometrical construction over the
space of connections.

                                       6
    The construction of the spectral triple (1) depends, as mentioned, cru-
cially on the choice of graphs. This choice is closely related to the group
of diffeomorphisms acting on the Hilbert space H . We find that the choice
of a restricted system of graphs amounts to a type of gauge fixing of the
diffeomorphism group. Thus, the Hilbert space H does not carry an action
of any smooth diffeomorphisms. Rather, it carries an action of a discrete
group of diffeomorphisms associated to the inductive system of graphs. This
means that the construction reduces the diffeomorphism group to a countable
group.
    The spectral triple (1) has a clear interpretation in terms of a non-
perturbative, background independent Quantum Field Theory related to
gravity. First of all, since the triple exists over a space of connections the
Dirac type operator D should be interpreted as a global functional deriva-
tion operator. Also, the Hilbert space H has an inner product which involves
a functional integral. Next, we find that the interaction between the Dirac
type operator D and the loop algebra B reproduces the Poisson structure
of General Relativity. Furthermore, the Hilbert space H is found to be
directly related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeomorphism invariant
states known from Loop Quantum Gravity [23]. The difference between the
two is given by the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H . Thus, we
interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)
diffeomorphism constraint.
    The square of the Dirac type operator D has the form of an integral over
the underlying manifold M. The integrand is a quantity which, in terms of
canonical quantum gravity, has an interpretation as an area-squared density
operator. This operator resembles the area operators known in Loop Quan-
tum Gravity [24]. Furthermore, we suggest that pD q2 should be interpreted
in terms of an action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D the form
of a Feynman integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.
    It is important to realize that the construction works in any dimension
and does not require a foliation of the underlying manifold.
    The construction of the Dirac type operator D involves an infinite di-
mensional Clifford bundle. This structure entails the canonical anticommu-
tation relations (CAR) algebra, which appears as a tensor factor acting on
the Hilbert space H .
    Technically, the triple (1) satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spec-
tral triple. This is due to the fact that the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle

                                        7
entails a large degeneracy of the spectrum of D which, naively, fails to have
compact resolvent. The solution to this problem is, in short, to integrate
out the symmetry group related to this degeneracy. This process leads to a
semi-finite spectral triple.
    The Dirac type operator D is gauge invariant. It is, however, not invari-
ant under the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H . This means
that D is, by itself, not an observable in a physical sense. We suggest to
apply a standard trick of Noncommutative Geometry: One obtains invari-
ant quantities by multiplying the algebra of observables with the relevant
symmetry group. A prime example of this method is the identification of
two points: By applying the noncommutative trick one obtains, besides in-
variance under exchange of the points, additional degrees of freedom which,
ultimately, leads to the Higgs mechanism. In the present case we expect this
general mechanism to entail further degrees of freedom.
    Let us note in passing, that the algebra of holonomy loops that we work
with in this paper is smaller than the correponding algebra of Wilson loops.
However, the missing information is recovered by the Hopf algebra structure
of the algebra of holonomy loops. The missing information is coded in the
extra structure coming from the fact that it is given as a (norm closure of a)
group algebra
                             CrfL , L loops on S s ,
where S denotes the entire inductive system of triangulations. As such it
has a Hopf algebra structure and for example the connections on M can be
recovered as Hopf algebra homomorphisms into the group algebra of G.
    The construction of the Dirac type operator D is not unique. In fact,
we find a large class of Dirac type operators labelled by infinite sequences
tanu of real parameters. The operator D has compact resolvent whenever
the sequence diverges sufficiently fast. These parameters are related to the
scaling behaviour of the operator and are clearly of metric origin. Thus, in
order to obtain a Dirac type operator D we are forced to choose a certain
scaling behaviour.
    It is clear that a correct interpretation of the sequence tan u is imperative
since the existence of the operator D depends crucially hereon. In this paper
we present one possible solution as to how these free parameters should be
dealt with. We propose an extension of the spectral triple (1) to include
the sequence tan u as dynamical degrees of freedom. The result is a new
triple pBt , Dt , Ht q which is a fibration of spectral triples pB , D , H q. We

emphasise, however, that the question as to how the sequence tan u should
be understood and dealt with remains open.
    This paper is this first of two papers concerned with the spectral triple
(1). This paper is primarily concerned with the general construction and
physical interpretation of the triple. The second paper [22] deals with the
concise mathematical construction.

1.1    Outline of the construction
Before we go into details we first give a brief outline of the construction. The
first step is concerned with the formulation of a semi-finite spectral triple over
a space of connections. The triple is, as mentioned, based on a -algebra of
loops which we denote by B . A smooth loop l gives a map from the space
of smooth connections, denoted A, into the structure group G

                            l : ∇ Ñ Holp∇, lq P G ,

 where Holp∇, lq is the holonomy of the connection ∇ P A along l and G is a
compact connected Lie group. In order to describe the algebra of holonomy
loops we first restrict the loop algebra to a finite graph Γ with edges ǫi (see
figure 1.1). Seen from Γ the connection ∇ can be seen as point ∇ in the
space Gn
                         ∇  pg1 , . . . , gn q P Gn  AΓ ,


                                         9
where n is the number of edges in Γ and where gi  Holp∇, ǫi q is the holon-
omy transform along the i’th edge. That is, a connection is given by its
holonomy transforms along edges ǫi . Clearly, AΓ is a highly inaccurate pic-
ture of the full space A of connections. However, one can show [22] that for
a suitable choice of embedded graphs

                       Γ1  Γ2  Γ3 . . .  Γn  . . .                     (2)

the space A is densely contained in the limit space

                                A  lim AΓn .
                                        n   Ñ8
This provides us with the strategy to construct a spectral triple over A. With
the system of graphs given by nested triangulations we construct, at the level
of each graph Γn , a spectral triple

                                pBn, Dn, HnqΓ ,   n


where the algebra Bn is generated by loops in Γn , the operator Dn is some
Dirac operator on AΓn  Gn and where Hn  L2 pGn , ClpT  Gn qq. This triple
is almost canonical and the little choice one has is mostly eliminated by the
requirement that the construction of the triple should be compatible with
structure maps
                        Pnm : AΓn Ñ AΓm , n ¡ m
between the different coarse-grained spaces of field configurations.
   The Dirac type operator obtained in the limit is an operator on the space
G8 and is of the general form

                       a1 D1    a2 D2       ...   ak Dk   ...

where Dk is an operator corresponding to a certain level in the projective sys-
tem (2) and where the infinite sequence tak u determines the weight assigned
to each operator Dk . We find that for sequences satisfying

                       lim ak  8 sufficiently fast                        (3)
                       k   Ñ8
the limit spectral triple

                    pB , D, Hq : nlim pB , D , H q

                                            10
satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spectral triple.
    The second part of the construction is more tentative. This part is con-
cerned with the infinite sequence tak u of free parameters which enters the
construction of the semi-finite spectral triple pB , D , H q. The sequence tak u
is readily seen to carry metric data since it determines the scaling behaviour
of the operator D . Also, the sequence determines the measure that arises
in the square of D . Furthermore, the choice of parameters tak u is related
to the invariance properties of D . Based on these observations we choose to
include the sequence tak u as dynamical parameters in the construction. This
means that we first construct a spectral triple
                               pAa, Da, Haq ,                                  (5)
where elements in the algebra Aa are functions f px1 , x2 , . . .q on the moduli
space of sequences tak u satisfying condition (3). The construction of the
triple (5) is inspired by Higson and Kasparov [25]. The Hilbert space Ha is
a L2 space of functions over this moduli space and Da is a Dirac operator
hereon. Next, we merge the triple (5) with the triple (4) to obtain a total
spectral triple
                                pBt , Dt, Ht q ,                               (6)
where the Dirac type operator Dt combines the operators D and Da . It
is important to see that the first part of the Dirac operator, the operator
D , depends on the parameters tak u which the second part, the operator Da ,
probes. The exact form of this interdependency, which makes the operator
Dt highly nontrivial, is governed by the requirement that Ha is a Hilbert
space over an infinite dimensional space corresponding exactly to those se-
quences tak u which leaves the operator D θ-summable.

    The paper is organised as follows. Sections 2 - 4 give a self contained pre-
sentation of the mathematical construction of the spectral triple pB , D , H q.
Here, section 2 introduces the basic machinery used in this paper: First the
loop algebra associated to an abstract simplicial complex and the concept
of abstract connections associated to a simplicial complex. Thereafter pro-
jective systems of simplicial complexes. In section 3 we construct a spectral
triple on the level of a simplicial complex and in section 4 we obtain the
triple pB , D , H q via an inductive limit of simplicial complexes.
    Next, sections 5 - 8 are concerned with the physical significance of the
spectral triple pB , D , H q. In section 5 we show that the spectral triple

                                         11
involves a representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity. Then
in section 6 we give a detailed comparison between the setup presented in
this paper and the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity and find that the
two constructions, on a technical level, differ primarily in the way the dif-
feomorphism group is treated. Section 7 briefly reviews area operators in
Loop Quantum Gravity and finds that the square of the Dirac operator D
has a natural interpretation as a kind of global area operator. This leads
naturally, in section 8, to an interpretation of the operator D2 in terms of an
action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D a strong resemblance to
a partition function related to gravity.
    Then, in section 9, we describe the construction of the spectral triple
pBt , Dt, Ht q which includes the sequence tak u as dynamical variables. Finally,
in section 10 we mention that the Dirac type operator D defines a distance
                  
on the space A . Sections 11 and 12 contain a discussion and conclusion.
Three appendices are added to outline first an extended setup which avoids
the choice of a basepoint and next to discuss again a notion of diffeomorphism
invariance. The last appendix is concerned with certain symmetric states.


2     Projective systems of simplicial complexes
As explained in the introduction, the aim is to study geometrical structures
over a space of connections. To do this we apply a dual picture of the space of
connections. This means that, rather than studying the space of connections
itself, we will work with an algebra of functions on the space. This algebra
is an algebra of loops and has a natural interpretation in terms of holonomy
loops.
    The purpose of this section is to introduce the machinery needed to de-
scribe this algebra of loops. The strategy is to break up the algebra into
finite parts, introduce various geometrical structures on each finite part and
finally let the complexity of the construction increase infinitely to obtain the
full algebra of loops.
    To emphasise the purely combinatorial nature of the construction we
adopt a formalism which, for the main part of the analysis, avoids any refer-
ence to an underlying manifold. This means that we will work with abstract
graphs and their loop algebras. An alternative approach is to work directly
with graphs on a manifold and their loop algebras. This approach, which
may be intuitively clearer, is applied in [22].

        Figure 2: An abstract simplicial complex with directed edges.


2.1     Simplicial complexes and their loop algebras
We first introduce the notion of an abstract graph and its associated loop
algebra. The abstract graphs we consider are given by simplicial complexes.
Consider therefore first an abstract, finite, d-dimensional simplicial complex
K with vertexes vi and directed edges

                       ǫj : t0, 1u Ñ tvi u ,    ǫj p0q  ǫj p1q ,

connecting the vertexes. We shall refer to the two elements of the set t0, 1u
as start and endpoint of the edge. The construction which we present works
for a large class of simplicial complexes. We will, however, restrict ourselves
to simplicial complexes which corresponds to triangulations of d-dimensional
manifolds.
    We will consider based simplicial complexes which means that the com-
plex has a preferred vertex v0 .
    Given a simplicial complex K we wish to describe an algebra of based
loops living on K. First, a path is a finite sequence L  tǫi1 , ǫi2 , . . . , ǫin u of
edges in EK with the property that

                                 ǫik p1q  ǫik 1 p0q .

Next, a loop is a path satisfying

                                    ǫi1 p0q  ǫin p1q ,

and a based loop is a loop satisfying the additional requirement

                                 ǫi1 p0q  ǫin p1q  v0 .


                                          13
By ǫj we denote the edge ǫj with reversed direction

                            ǫj pτ q  ǫj p1  τ q ,            τ P t0, 1u .

A path may contain both edges and their reverse. We discard trivial back-
tracking by which we mean sequences that contain successions of edges ǫi
and their reverse ǫi . Thus, we introduce the equivalence relation

                      t. . . , ǫj , ǫk , ǫk , ǫl , . . .u  t. . . , ǫj , ǫl , . . .u ,
and regard a path as an equivalence class with respect to this relation.
   We define a product between two based loops Li  tǫji u, i P t1, 2u, simply
by gluing
                         L1  L2  ttǫj1 u, tǫj2 uu .
Notice that this product is noncommutative.
   The inversion of a based loop L  tǫj1 , . . . , ǫji , . . . , ǫjn u defined by

                                L  tǫjn , . . . , ǫji , . . . , ǫj1 u ,

is again a based loop and satisfy the requirements of an involution

                        pLq  L , pL1  L2q  L2  L1 .
Furthermore, we define the based identity loop L0 as the equivalence class
that includes the empty loop

                                             L0  tØu .

The based identity loop clearly satisfies

                          L0  L1  L1              based loops L1 .
This, together with the observation that

                                   L  L  L  L  L0 ,

implies that, for based loops, the involution equals an inverse. This provides
the set of based loops with a group structure. We call the group of based
loops associated to K for the hoop group (holonomy loops, see [18]), denoted
HGK .

                                                     14
   For the remaining part of this paper we shall consider only based loops
and will therefore drop the prefix ’based’.
   We finally consider formal, finite series of loops living on a complex K
                       ¸
                  a       ai Li ,     Li P HGK ,             ai P C .    (7)
                       i

The product between two elements a and b is defined by
                                      ¸
                           ab             pai  bj qLi  Lj ,
                                      i,j

and the involution of a is defined by
                                             ¸
                                     a          āi Li .
                                              i

The set of elements of the form (7) is a Æ-algebra. We denote this algebra
with BK .

2.2    Loop group homomorphisms and connections
We now introduce the notion of an abstract connection. Let G be a compact,
connected Lie-group and, for later reference, fix a matrix representation of
G.
   Next we introduce a G-bundle over a smooth manifold M and a loop l
in M. A smooth connection can be understood as a map

                             ∇ : l Ñ ∇plq P G ,                           (8)

which satisfies the condition

                       ∇pl1  l2 q  ∇pl1 q  ∇pl2 q ,                    (9)

where l1 and l2 are loops in M. Here, the map (8) is the holonomy transform
of ∇ along l, ∇plq  Holp∇, lq.
   This motivates the following definition of an abstract connection as a map

                              ∇ : tǫj u Ñ G ,                            (10)

that associates to each edge ǫj P EK a point gj P G. The map is required to
satisfy
                            ∇pǫj q  p∇pǫj qq1 .

                                             15
Denote by AK the space of all abstract connections associated to K. The
action of ∇ is extended to a path L  tǫi1 , ǫi2 , . . . , ǫin u simply by

                    ∇pLq  ∇pǫi1 q  ∇pǫi2 q  . . .  ∇pǫin q ,          (11)

where the product on the rhs is matrix multiplication. This makes ∇ a
group homomorphism from the hoop group HGK into G which means that it
satisfies
                     ∇pL1  L2 q  ∇pL1 q  ∇pL2 q .
This corresponds to condition (9) and justifies the terminology abstract con-
nection.
   Via the space AK we can equip the Æ-algebra formed by elements of the
form (7) with a natural norm given by
                                        ¸
                         }a}  sup }        ai ∇pLi q}G ,                 (12)
                                  P
                                ∇ AK

where the norm on the rhs of (12) is the matrix norm given by the repre-
sentation of G. The closure of the Æ-algebra BK of loops with respect to this
norm is a C Æ -algebra. We denote this loop algebra by BK .
    In fact, the algebra BK is a function algebra over the space AK with values
in the matrix representation of the group G. A loop L gives rise to a function
fL via
                    fL p∇q : ∇pLq , L P HGK , ∇ P AK .
Notice that the algebra of functions fL with the natural product

                                 fL1  fL2  fL1 L2 ,

is noncommutative whenever G is non-Abelian.
    The space AK is identified as a manifold

                                 A K  G n pK q ,

via the bijection

                AK Q ∇ Ñ p∇pǫ1 q, . . . , ∇pǫnpKq qq P GnpKq .            (13)

where npKq denotes the number of edges in VK . This identification gives rise
to various structures on AK . For example the topological structure is given
by the topological structure of GnpKq .

                                          16
                                                                                 ....



Figure 3: The lhs shows a triangulation (dimension  2) and the rhs its two
first barycentric subdivisions.


   A loop L  tǫi1 , ǫi2 , . . . , ǫik u gives, according to (13), rise a function on
GnpKq given by
                fL : pg1 , g2, . . . , gnpKq q Ñ gi1  gi2  . . .  gik P G .
    We think of the space AK as a ”coarse grained version of a space of
(smooth) connections”. To clarify this interpretation consider an embedding
of the simplicial complex into a triangulation
                                     φ:KÑT                                       (14)
and a trivial principal bundle P  M  G. Denote by A the space of smooth
connections in P . There is a natural map
               χK : A Ñ AK ,         χK p∇qpǫi q  Holp∇, φpǫi qq ,              (15)
where Holp∇, φpǫi qq denotes the holonomy of ∇ along the edge ǫi which now
lives in M via the embedding φ. This means that points in AK can be
understood in terms of connections. Clearly, the map (15) is not injective
which is exactly what is meant by ’coarse grained’. The idea is to gradually
increase the complexity of the simplicial complex and thereby to turn the map
(15) into an injection. Therefore, the next step is to introduce a refinement
procedure for the simplicial complex K.

2.3     The projective system
The key tool to refine the simplicial complex K is the barycentric subdivision
of simplexes. We will consider repeated barycentric subdivisions of K. Thus,
the basic element in our analysis of geometrical structures over spaces of
connections is an inductive systems of simplicial complexes. We start with
the following

                                             17
Definition 2.3.1 An inductive system of simplicial complexes is a countable
set ptKi u, tIjk uq of nested abstract simplicial complexes Ki and embeddings

                           Ijk : Kj Ñ Kk ,             j       k         (16)

so that Ijk is either a barycentric subdivision or an inversion of edges. The
set is required to satisfy
                               lim npKi q  8 .
                                     i

A barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex K is here understood as the
simultaneous subdivision of all simplices in K.
The simplest simplicial complex in the inductive system is called the initial
complex and is denoted Ko . The orientation of the initial complex is not
important and one simply chooses one.
   The embedding (16) gives rise to a projection between spaces of abstract
connections
                    Pn2 ,n1 : AKn2 Ñ AKn1 , n2 ¥ n1 ,
which, via (13), is identified as a projection between manifolds

                       Pn2 ,n1 : Gn2 Ñ Gn1 ,           n2 ¥ n1 .         (17)

The projection Pn2 ,n1 is given by composition of one or more of the following
operations:
   • multiplying gi1 with gi2 .

   • inverting gi .

   • leaving out some gi in pg1 , . . . , gn2 q P Gn2 .
  The embedding (16) commute by construction with the identification
AK  GnpKq , i.e. the diagram:

                               AKi 1         ÝÑ

                                                GnpK q     i 1

where σi is given by (13), commutes. This means that the limit space

                                     A : lim AK
                                         

is a pro-manifold. That is, it is the projective limit of manifolds. This gives
                                                    
us immediate access to various structures on A . For instance, since the
                                                                              
projections P in (17) are continuous they give a topological structure on A .
In general, the structure of a pro-manifold is a powerful tool that leads us to
                                                                 
both Hilbert space and metric structures on the limit space A .
    In section 4.2 we show that the space A of smooth connections is densely
                 
embedded in A (once a suitable embedding of the simplicial complex has
been applied, see (14)). This fact is the very reason for studying the space
                                   
A . It means that structures on A can equally be understood as structures
on A.


3     A spectral triple on a simplicial complex
The aim is to construct a spectral triple at the level of each simplicial complex
in an inductive system of simplicial complexes. The triples are required to
involve the loop algebras BKi as function algebras over the associated spaces
AKi of abstract connections. To ensure that the limit of increased complex-
ity is well defined we require the spectral triples to be compatible with all
projections induced by the inductive system of complexes. This means that
geometrical structures over AKi will converge to geometrical structures over
  
A.

3.1    Outline of the construction.
Before we go into details let us outline the construction of the spectral triple
at the level of a simplicial complex K. The starting point is the manifold
AK  GnpKq . It is natural to consider first the Hilbert space
                               HK  L2 pGnpKq q ,
where L2 is with respect to the Haar measure on GnpKq . Since we wish to
construct both a Dirac operator acting on HK and to have a representation
of the algebra BK on HK we need to equip the Hilbert space with additional
structure. Consider therefore instead the Hilbert space
                 HK  L2 pGnpKq , ClpT  GnpKq q b Ml pCqq ,                (18)
where l is the size of the representation of G and ClpT  GnpKq q is the Clif-
ford bundle involving the cotangent bundle over GnpKq . If we recall that

                                       19
points in GnpKq represents homomorphisms ∇ from the hoop group into G
we immediately have a representation of the loop algebra BK on HK

               fL  ψ p∇q  p1 b ∇pLqq  ψ p∇q ,         ψ P HK ,           (19)

where the first factor acts on the Clifford part of the Hilbert space and the
second factor acts by matrix multiplication on the matrix part of the Hilbert
space. Finally, we choose some Dirac operator DK on GnpKq and obtain the
triple

                              pBK , DK, HKq ,                               (20)

on the level of the simplicial complex K.
    It is not difficult to construct the candidate (20) for a spectral triple on
the space AK . The crucial point, however, is to ensure that the construction
is compatible with the induced projections between the simplicial complexes
(17). This requirement turns out to restrict the choice of Dirac operator on
AK considerably.
    To ease the notation we shall from now on write Ai for AKi , Bi for BKi ,
Hi for HKi , Di for DKi and ni for npKi q.

3.2    Notation and basic setup
Before we proceed with the construction we need some preparations. A point
pg1, . . . , gnq P Gn is denoted ḡ. Let Rg denote right translation on the group
G, i.e. Rg phq  hg. Accordingly, Lg denotes left translation. We also denote
by Rg the corresponding differential, Rg : Th G Ñ Thg G. Lg likewise. Given
a cotangent vector φ at the identity we define the right translated cotangent
vector field Rφ by:

                     Rφpg qpv q  φpRg1 pv qq ,   v P Tg G .

The left translated cotangent vector fields are defined equivalently. Given a
projection P : Gn Ñ Gm we denote by P the corresponding differential

                             P : Tḡ Gn Ñ TP pḡ q Gm

and by P  the induced map on cotangent spaces

                           P  : TPpḡq Gm Ñ Tḡ Gn .

                                        20
Consider the particular projection
                         P : G2 Ñ G ;           pg1, g2q Ñ g1  g2 .
An element in pv1 , v2 q P Tpg1 ,g2 q G2 transforms according to
                           P pv1 , v2 q Ñ pRg2 v1         Lg1 v2 q ,
which is best seen by writing v1  γ9 1 pτ q|τ 0 where
                                  γ1 pτ q  pγ11 pτ q, g2 q P G2
is the one parameter subgroup in G2 generated by v1 . P clearly maps γ1 pτ q
into γ11 pτ q  g2  Rg2 γ11 pτ q P G. The same argument applies to v2 . Corre-
spondingly, given an element of the cotangent bundle φ P Tg1 g2 G the dual
maps yields
                      P  φ  pRg21 φ, Lg11 φq P Tpg1 ,g2 q G2 ,                   (21)

3.3     The Hilbert space
To construct the Hilbert space related to a simplicial complex Ki we first
construct an inner product on T  Gni . We choose a left and right invariant
metric on G. The edges in K are numbered with 1, . . . , ni . In the following
we shall occasionally write n instead of ni  npKi q. Consider two elements
φ1 , φ2 P Tḡ Gni . We write φk  pφk1, . . . , φkn q and define the inner product
by
                                              ¸
                                              n

                                                                                      (22)
                                               

barycentric subdivision between the simplicial complex Ki and the initial
   5
    There is some freedom in the choice of N . We could also introduce a factor Nj asso-
ciated to each individual edge ǫj . Here, Nj counts the number of barycentric subdivisions
that lies between the edge ǫj and the simplest complex Kk (k j) that has the edge ǫj as
a segment of an edge in Kk . This choice therefore associated different weights to edges in
a simplicial complex according to their position in the complex.

complex Ko . In [22] we prove that the inner product (22) is compatible with
projections induced by embeddings (16).
   With the inner product (22) on T  Gn we construct the Clifford bundle
ClpT  Gn q and define an inner product on the Hilbert space (18)
                                       »
                             x|y        dµ  Tr x|yCl ,                         (23)

where dµ is the Haar measure on Gn , Tr is the trace on Ml and x|yCl is the
inner product of the Clifford bundle ClpT  Gn q. The inner product (23) is
compatible with projections (16). This gives us the Hilbert space (18).

3.4    The Dirac operator
The Dirac-like operator on each space Ai is required to be compatible with
the projections in the inductive system of complexes. Thus, the induced
maps

                      P  : T  Gm Ñ T  Gn ,             m      n,                   (24)

give rise to the compatibility conditions

               P  pDm v qpg1, . . . , gn q  Dn pP  v qpg1 , . . . , gn q ,         (25)

where v P L2 pGm , ClpT  Gm qq. These conditions largely restrict the Dirac-
like operator Di on Ki . On the initial complex Ko with the corresponding

where teij u is a global basis on T  G corresponding to the i’th copy of G. têij u
is the corresponding basis on T G, obtained from teij u via the inner product
(22). ∇lc is the Levi-Civita connection on G.
    The problem is therefore to find a Dirac operator on Gni compatible with
projections (16). Here, it is sufficient to deal with an edge ǫ and its partitions
generated by barycentric subdivisions of the complex to which ǫ belongs, see
figure 4. Once the operator is constructed here we obtain an operator on the
entire system of simplicial complexes by gluing the individual operators in
an obvious manner.
    The generic problem is the projection

                       P : G2 Ñ G ;          pg1, g2q Ñ g1  g2 ,                   (27)

which we now consider together with the induced map between cotangent
bundles (21). Let tei u be an orthonormal basis of Tid G and denote by

                                   ei pg q  Lg ei pidq  ei

the left-translated basis covectors at g P G. The push-forward of the basis
covector ei pg q in Tpg1 ,g2 q G by P  gives

                       P  ei pg1  g2 q  pRg21 ei pg q, Lg11 ei pg qq ,

where g  g1  g2 . This suggests a natural orthonormal basis of Tpg1 ,g2 q G2
given by

                                  Ei2,s  pEi1 , Ei2q ,                            (28)

    There is some freedom of choice here since the Dirac operator on Ko need not involve
the Levi-Civita connection. However, to obtain a self-adjoint operator certain invariance
properties must be satisfied [22].

satisfies the compatibility condition (25) if the connection ∇2 satisfies

   To obtain the general form of the Dirac like operator on Gn we first define

Next, we write

where s  p , , . . . , q is the sequence of signs which characterises the

where the sum runs over i as well as all appropriate sign sequences s.
   We define the connections ∇n recursively. That is, the action of ∇n on
basis covectors Ein,s are given recursively and thereafter extended via linearity
and the requirements of a derivation to the entire Clifford bundle. Thus, we
require

where E and Eˆ are basis covectors and vectors, respectively, of the type
pEi1, Ei2, . . . , Ein{2q at the level n2 . In equation (34) and in the following we
denote by pP  EˆqK general elements in the orthogonal complement to vectors
(and covectors) of the form P  ˆ      E. We fix the remaining freedom in ∇n with
the additional condition

                     ∇pnP  Ê qK pP  Ē qK  ∇pnP  Ê q pP  E¯qK  0 ,

which is required for the construction of the trace, see section 4.1 and [22].
The properties given in (34) are again dictated by the requirement that the
Dirac operator (33) is compatible with the projections.
    The proof that the operator (33) satisfies the compatibility condition (25)
is given in [22].

3.5     The general Dirac operator associated to Ki
The Dirac type operator (33) is not the most general operator satisfying the
requirements of compatibility with the structure maps (25). In fact, these
requirements renders substantial parts of the operator (33) free to modifi-
cations. This observation is closely related to the fact that the Dirac type
operator (33) will, at it stands, not descend to an operator with a compact
resolvent in the inductive limit of repeated barycentric subdivisions. It turns
out that the additional degrees of freedom are exactly the necessary leverage
needed to obtain a well-behaved Dirac type operator in the limit.

                                                 25

the general case, the modification of (33) is as follows: Let tak u be an infinite

subdivisions. Consider the n’th subdivision. Let s be a finite sequence of n

The general case where G is a non-Abelian Lie-group is more complicated.
The full analysis is given in [22] where we prove that for any compact Lie-
group G there exist a sequence tai u so that the number of eigenvalues within
a finite range is finite up to a controllable degeneracy. This result will be
clarified in the next section.


4    The limit of the triple pBn, Dn, Hn q
Up till now we have considered a system of embedded, abstract simplicial
complexes tKn u. To each simplicial complex Kn we introduced a space An
which we interpreted as a coarse-grained version of a space of connections.
The next step was to construct a spectral triple pBn , Dn , Hn q on each of the
spaces An . The spectral triple satisfies requirements of compatibility with
the operation of barycentric subdivision. This means that we can take the
limit of infinitely many barycentric subdivisions. The resulting triple, which
is denoted by pB , D , H q, has the following elements:
    First, the Hilbert space H is constructed by adding all Hilbert spaces
Hn

             H1  `K L2 pGnpKq , ClpT  GnpKq q b Ml pCqq{N ,             (39)

where N is the subspace generated by elements of the form

                          p. . . , v, . . . , Pij pvq, . . .q ,
where Pij are maps between Hilbert spaces Hn induced by (24). The Hilbert
space H is the completion of H1 . The inner product on H is the inductive
limit inner product. This Hilbert space is manifestly separable. Next, the
algebra

                               B : lim BK .                             (40)

contains loops defined on a simplicial complex Kn in tKn u as well as their
closure. Again, the algebra B is separable. Finally, the Dirac-like operator
Dn descends to a densely defined operator on the limit space H

                               D  lim Dn .                              (41)

4.1    A semi-finite spectral triple
The question is whether the triple pB , D , H q satisfies the requirements of
a spectral triple. Clearly, to have a true spectral triple is highly desirable,
first of all to ensure that we are operating on mathematically safe ground.
Also, the toolbox of Noncommutative Geometry is a rich one. It provides
not only metric structures to the underlying spaces involved, it also involves
aspects which does not exist in ordinary Riemannian geometry.
    To have a spectral triple pB, D, H q where B is a C Æ -algebra represented
on a Hilbert space H on which an unbounded, selfadjoint operator D acts,
means that the two requirements

   1. pλ  D q1 , where λ R R, is a compact operator

   2. rb, D s, where b P B, is a bounded operator and where B is a dense
      Æ-subalgebra of B
are satisfied. However, the triple pB , D , H q is not spectral in this sense.
The spectrum of D involves a large degeneracy due to the infinite dimen-
sional Clifford bundle. This means that the resolvent of D will not be com-
pact.
    There exist, however, another sense in which a triple pB, D, H q can be
called spectral. If there exist a trace on the algebra containing B and the
spectral projections of D, then pB, D, H q is called a semi-finite spectral triple
if pλ  D q1 is compact with respect to this trace.
    It turns out that the triple pB , D , H q does form a semi-finite spectral
triple. The sufficient requirement is that the sequence tak u satisfies

                     lim ak Ñ 8 ,     sufficiently fast .                    (42)
                      k

    A semi-finite spectral triple can be thought of as a spectral triple which
involves a redundant symmetry group. This symmetry group resembles a
gauge group and one must integrate out the extra degrees of freedom. In the
present case the symmetry group is identified as the endomorphisms of the
infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. To deal with this redundancy we first
define a trace on the algebra containing B as well as the spectral projections
of D .
    We will construct the trace at each level in the inductive system of sim-
plicial complexes and subsequently take the limit of repeated barycentric


                                       28
subdivisions. For the construction we factorize the Hilbert space. Choose a
global orthonormal frame in Te G. This choice gives rise to a decomposition

        L2 pGn , Ml b ClpT  Gn qq  L2 pGn q b Ml pCq b ClpTe Gn q.        (43)

We will construct the trace on the algebra

               Cn  KpL2 pGn qq b EndpMl q b EndpClpTe Gn qq.

where K here denotes the compact operators.
   Let T rop denote the operator trace on KpL2 pGn qq. For each n we have
the normalised trace tr on EndpClpTe Gn qq. We define the trace as

                           T r  T rop b T rl b tr.                          (44)

Note that the trace is independent of the choice of global orthonormal frame
in T  G, since a different choice of basis is given by a unitary transformation.
    In [22] we prove that the limit

                                  C : lim Cn

will be a C  -algebra and that the trace T r gives a trace on C . Since C
is contained in the weak closure of B the trace extends to a trace on B as
well.
    The important point in this construction is the normalisation of the trace
tr on EndpClpTe Gn qq. To explain this consider the step going from n to
n m. Let Pλ be the spectral projection of Dn for the eigenvalue λ. Going
from n to n m the spectral projection will roughly speaking be mapped
to Pλ b 1. Thus the size of the eigenspace λ grows in the same rate as the
dimension of the Clifford bundle. To remedy this defect we must ensure that

                                   tr p1q  1 ,

which is what the normalised trace does.
    The proof that pB , D , H q form a semi-finite spectral triple with respect
to the trace (44) is given in [22]. It turns out that in general the Dirac-type
operator (41) may require a perturbation at each level in the inductive sys-
tem. This perturbation deals with the fact that the operators Dn may, in
general, have nontrivial kernels which obstructs the control of the eigenvalues
of the limit operator D . These perturbations lift the entailed degeneracy,

                                       29
which would otherwise destroy the spectral properties of the triple. The re-
quired perturbation is, at each level in the projective system, bounded and
does not affect the commutator between D and the algebra B significantly.
For the special case G  SU p2q we find that the operators Dn have trivial
kernels and therefore that no perturbations are needed.

    To recapitulate, we have successfully constructed a large class of semi-
finite spectral triples pB , D , H q. The triples are labelled by infinite se-
quences tak u of real numbers satisfying limk ak Ñ 8 sufficiently fast.

    Let us end this section with a short discussion of the structure of the
Hilbert space H the role of the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. Consider
first the decomposition in (43) and rewrite it in the suggestive form

                L2 pGn q b Ml pCq b ClpTe Gn q  Hn,b b Hn,f ,

where Hn,b  L2 pGn q b Ml pCq. In the inductive limit this leads to the
decomposition
                          H  H,b b H,f .
Next we factorize the algebra H according to the above factorisation of the
Hilbert space. The result is

                                C  KpH,b q b C,

where
                             C  lim EndpClpTe Gn qq,
                                  n

where the morphisms in this inductive system are the unital ones. In par-
ticular C is a UHF-algebra and since ClpTe Gn q has dimension 2ndimpGq , the
C  -algebra C is isomorphic to the CAR algebra.
     The CAR algebra is an integral element of fermionic Quantum Field The-
ory. We find it interesting that this algebra naturally emerges from the triple
pB , D, Hq which, a priori, is an entirely ’bosonic’ construction. In section
11 we shall comment further on the appearance of the CAR algebra.

4.2     The space A and generalised connections
                                              
We have already indicated that the space A is a space of generalised connec-
tions. This means that it is a closure of the space A of smooth G-connections.

Figure 5: The embedding of the system tKi u into M gives rise to an inductive
system of triangulations tTi u.


To see this consider the embedding φ of the simplicial complex Ki

                                   Ti : φpKi q ,

where Ti is a triangulation of the manifold M. There is a natural map

              χ : A Ñ A ,      χ p∇qpφpǫi qq  Holp∇, φpǫi qq ,
                           
                                                                                (45)

where Holp∇, φpǫi qq is the holonomy of ∇ along the edge φpǫi q which now has
a location in M via the embedding φ. Further, if we are given two different
connections ∇1 , ∇2 P A they will differ in a point, say m P M, and hence
in a neighbourhood of m. We can therefore choose a small, directed edge
φpǫi q in a triangulation Ti that is sufficiently refined, so that φpǫi q lies in the
neighbourhood of m where the connections ∇1 and ∇2 differ. Furthermore,
because the system of triangulations contain edges in all directions in M we
can choose φpǫi q so that

                        Holp∇1 , φpǫi qq  Holp∇2 , φpǫi qq .

In other words, χ is an embedding, and hence the terminology generalised
connection is justified.
    This means that we have successfully turned the map (15) into an injec-
tion by repeating the barycentric subdivisions of the simplicial complexes.
                           
    The identification of A as a space of connections provides us with a new
understanding of the spectral triple pB , D , H q. First, as already mentioned,

                                         31
according to (45) the algebra of loops should be interpreted in terms of
holonomy loops
                          fL p∇q  HolpL, ∇q .
It is a well known result (see [26] and [27] and references therein) that the
complete set of holonomies, as well as their associated Wilson loops, contain
the full information, up to gauge transformations, about the underlying space
of smooth connections. The fact that the map (45) is an injection means that
the algebra B , which involves a highly restricted set of loops, does in fact
contain the same information about the underlying space of connections as
does the full set of smooth or piece-wise analytic loops.
                                                                             
    Second, since the Dirac-type operator D is a derivation on the space A
it should be understood in terms of a functional derivation operator

                                        D 
                                                     δ

in some integrated sense which shall become clearer soon. Finally, elements
in the Hilbert space H are functions over field configurations of connections
and the inner product in H comes in the form of a functional integral
                                          »
                xΨp∇q| . . . |Ψp∇qy          

                                  
That is, an integral8 over A .
   All together it is clear that the construction should be interpreted in
terms of Quantum Field Theory.

    Notice that the diffeomorphism group diff(M) has no natural action on
  
A or the algebra B , except for a few, discrete diffeomorphisms. We shall
comment on this fact in section 6.2.

4.3     Gauge transformations
It remains to clarify whether the Dirac type operator D is gauge invariant.
To this end let U be an element of the gauge group G of M  P , i.e. U :
   8
     This integral resembles functional integrals found elsewhere in physics. First, it is
similar to the inner product on the Hilbert space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states
in Loop Quantum Gravity, see below. Second, it also resembles functional integrals in
lattice gauge theories. Here, the main difference is the ’lattice spacing’ a in lattice gauge
theories which gives the continuum limit a Ñ 0.

                                              32
M Ñ G is a smooth function. Given a connection ∇ P A, U induces a gauge
                       ˜ Given a path L with startpoint x1 and endpoint
transformed connection ∇.
x2 the holonomy along L transforms according to

                   Holp∇, Lq Ñ U px1 qHolp∇, LqU  px2 q .

To determine the properties of the Dirac type operator D when subjected to
a gauge transformation we consider first the case An  Gn that corresponds
to n divisions of a single edge. Consider the general transformation

  Un : Gn Ñ Gn ,     pg1 , g2, . . . , gnq Ñ pu0g1u1 1, u1g2u2 1, . . . , un1gnun 1q ,
where u0 , u1 , . . . , un are unitary group elements in G. This transformation
generates a map

                Un : L2 pGn , ClpT  Gn qq Ñ L2 pGn , ClpT  Gn qq

between Hilbert spaces. We need to check whether

              Dn ξ  Un Dn Un ξ ,     ξ P L2 pGn , ClpT  Gn qq .                      (47)

In [22] we find that (47) holds whenever the connections used to construct
Dn satisfy a certain gauge compatibility condition. In particular, we find
that the special flat connections entering the construction of Dn do satisfy
this condition. This, in turn, implies that the full Dirac type operator D is
gauge invariant. For the full analysis we refer the reader to [22].

4.4    The commutator between D and the algebra B
Section 5 is concerned with the relation between the Poisson algebra of Gen-
eral Relativity and the algebra B . The point is that the interaction between
the Dirac type operator D and the algebra B equals the interaction between
conjugate variables of gravity. Before we show this we need to calculate the
commutator between the operator (36) and a loop operator.
    First of all, the commutator is non vanishing

                              rD, bs  0 ,     b P B

since, on the level of refinement corresponding to n edges, b is a non-trivial
matrix valued function on Gn and D is the Dirac-type operator on Gn .

                                          33
   Consider first the simple case where a loop Lj corresponds to the function
on Gn
                           fLj : pg1 , . . . , gn q Ñ gj .
Thus, the loop Lj is really just the j’th edge. We wish to calculate the
commutator
                          rdÊ j , fLj sξ pg1, . . . , gnq ,
                                      i

where ξ P L pG q. If we denote by ei the generators of the Lie algebra g,
              2    n

The sign on the rhs of (49) correspond to the j’th sign in the sequence s.
Thus, for i  1 all the signs are positive and else the total number of ’s

    we here consider the subdivision of an edge into n segments. Therefore, Dn is the
operator given by (36).

                                                         34
where each commutator on the rhs is calculated by inserting the appropriate
operator Dn corresponding to the level of refinement given by the loop L.
   Thus, the action of D on a single loop is to insert the ’twisted’ generators
 j
Ei of the Lie-algebra into the loop at each vertex the loop passes through
and to multiply with an appropriate element in the Clifford bundle.

4.5    The role of the sequence tan u
In section 9 we will include the sequence tan u as dynamical variables in the
construction. To motivate this step we need a better understanding of the
sequence tan u and the role it plays in the spectral triple pB , D , H q.
    Primarily, the role of the sequence tan u is to shift an otherwise impossible
degeneracy in the spectrum of the operator D via the condition (42). The
parameters ai introduces a hierarchy between the eigenvalues of D on the
                                    
infinitely many copies of G in A . This hierarchy is closely related to the
scaling behaviour of the construction.
    Consider first a line segment divided in two, corresponding to the projec-
tion
                                  P : G2 Ñ G .
Functions on G2 naturally fall into two classes: push-forward of functions on
G
                 P  : L2 pGq Ñ L2 pG2 q , pP  f qpg1  g2 q ,
and the orthogonal complement hereof. We denote the former V and the
latter VK  pP  L2 pGqqK . Functions in V correspond to information which is
also contained in the less refined picture which involves only one copy of G.
This is the simplest and most coarse-grained description of parallel transports
along the line segment available. Function in VK , on the other hand, contain
additional information which cannot be traced back to the simpler picture.
Each additional division of the line segment refines the picture further.
    It is clear that any division of a line segment into two will involve new
segments which are shorter - independently of any choice of metric - than
the original segment. Therefore, functions in VK correspond to information
          
about A which is deeper, i.e. at a shorter distance, compared to information
carried by functions in V .
    The role of the sequence tai u is to take this scaling behaviour into account.
                                            
The operator D weights functions on A according to where in the projective
system of spaces Ai the information originates (see figure 6). Therefore, if

                                       35

                                                   ai 2

Figure 6: The role of the parameters tai u is to weight the different segments
of a given loop according to the refinement of the segments.


a function ψ P L2 pA q is the push-forward of functions on L2 pAi q then the
                     

corresponding eigenvalues of ψ are weighted with the appropriate parameter
ai .
                                  
     Thus, if we wish to probe A at a very short distance, this information
will come with a very high weight factor ai corresponding to high energy.
                          
On the other hand, if A is probed at a more coarse-grained level, then the
corresponding eigenvalues are weighted with smaller weights ai .
     Let us end this subsection with a curious observation. If we start with a
meter, then we find that it takes about 116 subdivisions of the meter to reach
the Planck length of 1.6  1035 meter. This corresponds then to 116 of the
parameters tai u. Thus, although the sequence tai u is infinite, the number of
parameters involved when probing physical scales is certainly finite.


5    Link to canonical quantum gravity I. Op-
     erator brackets.
In the next two sections we relate the construction of the spectral triple
pB , D, Hq to canonical quantization of field theories and in particular to
canonical quantum gravity.
    The first section is concerned with the Poisson brackets of General Rel-
ativity. We first introduce the formulation of General Relativity based on
Ashtekar variables. The fact that this formulation has a gauge connection
as a primary variable is the Raison D’étre for the study of spaces of connec-
tions in this paper. Next, we show that the interaction between the Dirac

                                     36
type operator D with the algebra B reproduces the structure of the Poisson
brackets of General Relativity when these are formulated in terms of loop
variables. This means that the triple pB , D , H q includes a representation
of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity.
    Section 6 is primarily concerned with a more detailed comparison between
the construction presented in this paper (the choice of graphs, the Hilbert
space) and the study of spaces of connections within Loop Quantum Gravity.
It turns out that the key difference between the two lies in the treatment of
the diffeomorphism group. We find that the Hilbert space H is directly
related to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant states known from
Loop Quantum Gravity. The difference between the two is a group of discrete
diffeomorphisms. This means that the representation of the Poisson brackets
given by the triple pB , D , H q includes partial diffeomorphism invariance as
a first principle.
    For the remaining part of this section we will, unless otherwise stated,
restrict ourselves to G  SU p2q and dimension three.

5.1    Canonical gravity
For an introduction to canonical gravity see for example [28, 29]. Let us first
fix some notation. We follow [29] and [30]. Consider the vierbein formulation
of General Relativity where EµA is the vierbein and gµν  EµA EνB ηAB is the
corresponding space-time metric where ηAB  t1, 1, 1, 1u. Here µ, ν, . . . and
A, B, ... denote curved and flat space-time indices respectively. We assume
that space-time can be foliated according to M  Σ  R where Σ is a spatial
manifold. Let m, n, . . . and a, b, . . . denote curved and flat spatial indices,
respectively. Denote by eam the spatial dreibein. The spin connection ωµAB
is given by
                             ωµAB  EAν ∇µ EBν ,
where ∇µ is the covariant derivative which involves the Christoffel connec-
tion.
    The canonical momenta Πm a corresponding to the dreibein are obtained
from the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian L [29]

The Hamiltonian formulation of gravity involves a set of 3 constraints10 re-
lated to the symmetries of the theory: the Gauss constraint corresponding
to gauge invariance; the diffeomorphism constraint corresponding to spatial
diffeomorphisms within Σ; the Hamiltonian constraint encoding the full 4-
dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and thus containing the dynamics of
General Relativity. The diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints corre-
sponds to 4 of the 10 Einstein field equations. The Hamiltonian itself is a
linear combination of the two constraints. In the quantum theory, this leads
to the famous Wheeler-DeWitt equation.

Often the variables tẼ, Au are contracted with Pauli matrices τ a according

in order to replace Lorentz indices by spinorial SU p2q indices.
    The variables tẼ, Au are the well-known Ashtekar variables [16, 17] and
the parameter γ  0 in (52) is known as the ’Barbero-Immirzi parameter’
[31, 32].
    The identification of a gauge connection Ama as a primary variable of
General Relativity permits applications of techniques from Yang-Mills theory.
In particular, one might shift focus from connections to their holonomies [11]

To obtain the Poisson brackets pick a curve C  C1  C2 which intersects
S at the single point C1 X C2 . Then the Poisson bracket between the new
variables reads [33]
         tFSapẼ q, HolC pAqu  ιpC, S qγHolC pAqτ aHolC pAq ,
                                                 1           2           (55)
where ιpC, S q  1 or 0 encodes information about the intersection of S and
C (ιpC, S q vanishes when C and S do not intersect).
    Notice that the structure of the bracket (55) is identical to structure of the
commutators (49) and (50) between the loop algebra B and the Dirac type
operator D . Both set of commutators prescribe an insertion of an element
in the Lie-algebra into the loop or curve at an ”intersection point”: either
at the intersection between the surface S and the curve C, or at the vertex
between neighbouring edges in a given simplicial complex. To investigate this
correspondence we first need to consider the canonical quantization approach
to Quantum Gravity.

5.2    Canonical Quantum Gravity
When the canonical quantization procedure is applied to gravity the philoso-
phy is to rewrite Poisson brackets like (51), (53) or (55) as operator brackets
and represent the canonical variables on a suitable Hilbert space as multipli-
cation and derivation operators. Clearly, there is a freedom in choice as to
which variables should be represented as multiplication operators and which
should be represented as differential operators. Using Ashtekars variables it
is possible to represent the holonomies HolC pAq as multiplication operators
                                 HolC pAq Ñ C
and the corresponding triad and flux variables Ẽ and F as differential oper-
ators

on a suitable Hilbert space corresponding to a configuration space of connec-
tions. In the following we refer to the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity.
We postpone to section 6 the construction of the Hilbert space on which the
operators C and F are represented within Loop Quantum Gravity. For now
it suffices to state that the Hilbert space is based on a projective system of
piecewise analytic graphs. Therefore, we assume that the bracket
                                rFaS , Cs  γC1τ aC2 ,                               (57)
where C  C1  C2 is piecewise analytic, is defined as an operator bracket act-
ing on a Hilbert space of functions over a configuration space of connections.

    We wish to show that the spectral triple pB , D , H q reproduces the
operator bracket (57). To do this we will use the operators FaS to construct
a new operator D. The commutator between this operator and an operator
C is then shown to be identical to the commutator between the Dirac type
operator D and an element of the algebra B .
    To proceed we restrict the algebra (57) to an inductive system of simplicial
complexes tKi u and an embedding hereof φpKi q  Ti P M. Thus, we consider
only curves Cj which coincide with edges11 ǫj in the some triangulation Ti .
To simplify matters further we first consider a single edge ǫ in the initial
complex K0 . This edge corresponds to a sequence of edges tǫ1 , ǫ2 , . . . , ǫ2N u
in the i’th triangulation Ti arising through N barycentric subdivisions, see
figure 7. For simplicity we set γ  1. For each edge ǫj there exist a set of
sections Êij pg1 , . . . , gn q in the tangent bundle of the j’th copy of G, see section
3.4. Expand the corresponding generators Eji in terms of Pauli matrices
                                        Eji  bji,a τ a ,
  11
       To be exact, we here assume that the triangulation Ti is piecewise analytic.

where we introduce a set of surfaces tSk u chosen so that Sk intersects the
triangulation Ti at its vertices only. Choose the numbering of the surfaces so
that Sk intersects the edge ǫk at its endpoint, see figure 8. Then we obtain
(no summation over repeated indices)
                                 rFji , Cj s  Cj Eji .                        (58)
We chose Sk in a way so that the sign in (58) is always positive when the
orientation of the curve Ck coincide with the orientation of the triangulation.
    The commutator (58) has the same structure as the commutator (48)
between the vector field Êij and the group element corresponding to the j’th
copy of G in Gn . This suggest that the vector field Eˆij corresponds to the
flux operator Fji
                                       Fji Ø Êij                              (59)
when Fj is restricted to the triangulation Ti .
   Next, we define the operator
                         ¸                                              
               Dn  n1         ampsq Ein,s  pF1i , F2i , F3i , . . .q  s ,   (60)
                         s,i

 where s is the sequence of signs p , , , . . .q corresponding to the vector
Ein,s and the ’’ in the bracket to the right is defined in (37). Then, the final
commutator reads
                                  ¸                
                    rDn, Cj s  n1 ampsq  Cj Eji  Ein,s .                 (61)
                                  s,j


                                              41
In (61) the sign on the rhs is again given by the i’th entries in the sequences
s. The commutator (61) has precisely the same form as the commutator (49).
This shows that the operator Dn corresponds exactly to the Dirac operator
Dn defined in equation (36):

                                       Dn Ø Dn .
    Notice also that the choice of surfaces Sk has no importance for the defi-
nition of (60). Only the intersection points, the vertices, counts. Therefore,
the surfaces Sk serve merely as labels of the vertices.
    The generalisation to the full picture where we consider the complete set
of edges tǫk u in Ti is straightforward. The corresponding operator, which we
again denote Dn , is simply build from the operators associated to each edge
ǫk in the initial triangulation T0 . Further, we denote the limiting operator
with D . Again, the message is that the operator D corresponds exactly to
the Dirac like operator D . The difference is that D is written in terms of
variables from canonical quantum gravity.
    This shows that the spectral triples pB , D , H q constructed in section
4.1 give a representation of the Poisson brackets (55). The representation is
separable and based on a system of graphs dense in M.
    In which sense does the representation of the Poisson algebra (55) given
by the triple pB , D , H q differ by the representation used in Loop Quantum
Gravity? To answer this question we need a precise comparison of the gen-
eral setup used in this paper with the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity.
This will be the topic of the next section.

   For later reference we need an expression for the square of the Dirac-like
operator (60). We write
                            ¸
                    D2         cj Fij Fij        lower order ,          (62)

where cj are constants depending on the parameters tai u and where we by
lower order refer to terms which are linear in Fij .

In this section we first introduce the inductive system of piecewise analytic

We find that the essential difference between the two spaces is separability.
This issue is closely related to the manner in which the diffeomorphism group
is treated in Loop Quantum Gravity and this paper respectively.
    These insights lead us to consider the role of diffeomorphism invariance
in Quantum Gravity, in particular the diffeomorphism constraints found in
Loop Quantum Gravity. We find that the Hilbert space H is, up to a discrete
symmetry group, identical to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant
states in Loop Quantum Gravity.

The space A was studied in [19].
   Again, we consider the space A of smooth G-connections. We repeat the
argument of section 4.2: There is a natural map χa : A Ñ A given by
                                                          a

where Holp∇, P q denoted the holonomy of ∇ along P . If we are given two
different smooth connections ∇1 , ∇2 P A they are going to differ in a point,

                                     43
let us say m, and hence also in a neighbourhood of m. We can therefore
choose a small directed analytic path P in a neighbourhood of m such that

the terminology generalised connection is justified.

6.1.1   Projective structure on A .
On M we will consider the system of connected piecewise analytic graphs.
This system is directed under inclusions of graphs. Given a piecewise con-
nected analytic graph Γ in M we denote by tǫ1 , . . . , ǫnpΓq u the edges and by
tv1 , . . . , vmpΓq u the vertices. Let PΓ be the set of paths in Γ and define
                               AΓ  HompPΓ , Gq .

An inclusion of graphs Γ1  Γ induces a projection

                              PΓ1 Γ : AΓ Ñ AΓ1 .                               (64)

Since every analytic path is a path in a piecewise analytic graph and vice
versa we get
                               A  lim AΓ,
                                 a

where the projective limit is taken over all piecewise analytic graphs.
   If we choose an orientation of the edges tǫ1 , . . . , ǫnpΓq u we obtain again an
identification
                                 AΓ  GnpΓq
via the map
                   AΓ Q ∇ Ñ p∇pǫ1 q, . . . , ∇pǫnpΓq qq P GnpΓq .
This identification gives rise to various structures on AΓ and therefore also on
  a
A . For example the topological structure given by the topological structure
of GnpΓq . Also the projections PΓ1 Γ are continuous and hence give a topological

structure on the projective limit, i.e. A . We note that A is dense in A , see
[22] and references therein.
    Another structure arising from this identification is the measure or more
relevant the Hilbert space structure. Since G is a compact group we can
equip GnpΓq uniquely with product Haar measure and define

                              L2 pAΓ q  L2 pGnpΓq q.

6.1.2   Actions of the diffeomorphism group
Since an analytic diffeomorphism of M maps P to P we get an action of the
group of analytic diffeomorphisms Dif fa pMq on A . On the other hand the

group of all diffeomorphisms Dif f pMq acts on A but does not extend to an
             a
action on A . There are several different way of completing A depending on
the choice of ”lattice”, for example piecewise analytic paths like in the case
described above, various kinds of smooth paths, where one gets an action
of the full diffeomorphism group. See [35, 36] for results and a thorough
discussion. The different completions all contain A but the crucial difference
seems to be the size of the symmetry group.

    In the following we will demonstrate the relationship between and role
played by these three spaces of connections.
    First, it is important to see that the shift from A to a larger space of
generalised connections is necessary to equip A with topological and Hilbert
                                                 a
space structures. The identification of A and A as pro-manifolds is the key
step to obtain this. The space A itself is not a pro-manifold.
                                                          a          a
    The key difference between the two spaces A and A is that A has an
                                                     
action of the (analytic) diffeomorphism group; A does not. Further, the
Hilbert space structure associated to the two spaces are respectively non-
                  a                    
separable for A and separable for A . That is, the way A is completed is
decisive for how large a symmetry group remains. This shows that there is a
direct link between separability of the Hilbert space structure and the action
of the diffeomorphism group.
    The following diagram illustrate the relationship between the three spaces
of connections:

was unsuccessful exactly because the number of possible projections (64) is

between graphs sufficiently. We appear to find the following hierarchy:

    One way to think of the space A is to see it as the space of (smooth)
connections subjected to a sort of gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism group13 .
Here gauge fixing is meant in the sense that a symmetry group is (partly)
removed while the integration at hand still involves the entire space, in this
case the space of smooth connections A. In this sense the inner product (46)
resembles a functional integral over A ”up to diffeomorphisms”.
                                           
    Another way to think of the space A is to relate it to the construction
of the Hilbert space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states in Loop Quan-
tum Gravity, see [23]. To do this we first notice that each triangulation in
particular is a graph, and we hence get an embedding

On the other hand consider the Hilbert space formally defined by
            Hdif f  diffeomorphism invariant states in lim L2 pAΓ q.
                                                                 ÝÑ

    In fact, space A is, in this line of thinking, subjected to another partial gauge fixing
by reducing the symmetry group from the group of diffeomorphisms to the .group of
analytical diffeomorphisms.

can, via a diffeomorphism, be mapped into a triangulated graph. The map
is not injective because of the symmetries of the triangulated graph.

The amount by which the map Ξ fails to be injective is exactly the symmetry
group diffp△q of discrete diffeomorphisms of triangulations. Therefore, we
can think of the Hilbert space L2 pAT q, and thereby also H , as Hilbert spaces
of diffeomorphism invariant states up to the discrete group diffp△q. In this
picture one should therefore think of a loop associated to a simplicial complex
as a kind of equivalence class of smooth loops where the equivalence is with
respect to smooth diffeomorphisms.
    It is interesting that the construction of H relies on a partition of the
diffeomorphism group in a ’countable’ and a ’over countable’ part. Here,
the countable part is diffp△q. This partition is a compromise between two
opposite considerations:
   • For the Hilbert space H to carry a representation of the loop algebra
     it must have an action of at least parts of the diffeomorphism group
     since the loop algebra itself is not diffeomorphism invariant. This re-
     quirement works to maximise the size of the remaining symmetry group
     diffp△q.

   • The construction of a Dirac type operator acting on H requires a strict
     control over permissible embeddings of the type (16). This requirement
     works to minimise the size of diffp△q.
Therefore, the identification of the symmetry group diffp△q is essential for
the construction of the spectral triple pB , D , H q.
    Let us now return to the question regarding the different representa-
tions of the Poisson algebras (53) and (55), the representation used in Loop

                                         48
Quantum Gravity and the representation contained in the triple pB , D , H q.
We find that the different representations correspond to different choices of
holonomy loops in (55). The representation used in Loop Quantum Gravity
involves the non separable Hilbert space L2 pA q whereas the representation
                                               a

presented in this paper involves the separable Hilbert space L2 pA q. The
                                                                      

central difference between the two representations lies therefore in the corre-
sponding symmetry groups. The larger the class of loops is, the larger is the
symmetry group.


7     Area operators
The area operators are an important set of operators in Loop Quantum Grav-
ity [24]. It turns out that the area operator also exist within the framework
described by the spectral triple pB , D , H q. These operators are, however,
not very natural objects to consider within this framework. However, we find
that the square of the Dirac-like operator D has a natural interpretation in
terms of a global area-squared operator.

7.1    Area operators in Loop Quantum Gravity
Classically, the area of a 2-dimensional surface S in Σ is given by
                                     »       ?
                           ApS q             dF a  dF a .
                                         S

where the area element dF a was defined in (54). To convert this expression
into a form suitable for quantization consider
                                           a partition of S into N smaller
surfaces Sn such that for any N we have n Sn  S. Then the area of S can
be written
                                     N b
                                     ¸
                     ApS q  lim                  FSi n FSjn δij .        (67)
                              N   Ñ8 n1

In Loop Quantum Gravity, the area operator is constructed by substituting
the classical flux variable FSi n with the corresponding operators FiSn
                                     N b
                                     ¸
                     ApS q  lim                  FiSn FjSn δij .         (68)

The point here is that this operator, at the level of a given graph, is well
defined. This is due to the fact that the number of intersections of any graph
with the surface S is finite. Continued subdivisions of S are obsolete once the
resolution is reached where each Sn contains one intersection point. If the
area element Sn does not involve an intersection with the graph Γ then the
corresponding operator FiSk vanishes. This means that the surface S has a
minimal subdivision into elementary cells Sn each containing one intersection
point with the graph. The area operator obtains the form

                              ApS q              Appi q ,
                                            i

where the sum runs over intersection points pn and where
                                    b

The operator Appn q basically assigns an area to the intersection point pn .
The spectrum of the area operator ApS q, at the level of a given graph Γ, can
be computed and reads [15]
                                   #                                 +

where p are intersection points between S and the graph Γ and jp are positive
half integers (for details and subtleties we refer to [15]). lP l is the Planck
length.

7.2    A global area operator
The spectral triple pB , D , H q involves another representation of the oper-
ator algebra (57), now based on curves in the inductive system of triangu-
lations. Therefore, it is possible to repeat the line of reasoning from Loop
Quantum Gravity and define a second area operator, now based on the Dirac-
like operator D and the vectors Eˆij .
    Recall the interpretation (59) which relates the vectors Eˆij to the flux
operators Fij . This leads to an area operator
                                        ¸b
                     A pS q  lim                FiSn FjSn δij .            (70)

                                          50
where FiSn are as explained in section 5.2.
    The difference between the operators (68) and (70) lies not in the expres-
sion of the operators themselves but rather in the Hilbert spaces on which
they act. The former acts on a non-separable Hilbert space whereas the latter
acts on the separable Hilbert space H .
    The area operator (70), however, does not appear to be a natural object
in the construction presented here. It involves a surface S which has no
natural place in this setting.
    We can nevertheless apply the line of reasoning from Loop Quantum
Gravity to obtain a better understanding of the operator D . Consider again
the interpretation of D in terms of conjugate variables of canonical gravity.
If we combine equation (62) with equation (69) we obtain
                                  ¸
                           D2            ci Apvi q2       ...               (71)
                                      i

where, in the limit, the sum runs over all vertices in the inductive system of
triangulations tTi u. It is clear that the set of all vertices is a dense set M.
Therefore, the sum over all vertices, weighted with the sequence tai u and the
a multiplicity factor given by the valency of the vertex, defines an integral
over M                          ¸        »
                                   ... Ñ    dVol .
                                vi              M

This provides us with a surprising interpretation of D2 and thereby of D2 .
According to (71) it is an operator which is related to the area of the entire
manifold M

                                      M

Clearly, the spectrum of ∆ is discrete.


8     The spectral action
The identification of the operator D2 as a global operator related to the area
of the underlying manifold leads us to a new interpretation of the spectral
triple pB , D , H q. In this section we suggest that the operator D2 should be
thought of as an action. Subsequently, we point out that the spectral action

                                               51
of D resembles a partition function. The argumentation presented in the
following is tentative.
    The first indication that pD q2 may be understood in terms of an action is,
as already mentioned, that is has the form of an integral over an underlying
manifold.
    The second indication is directly related to the classical Einstein-Hilbert
action. Within the language of Noncommutative Geometry the Einstein-
Hilbert action has a natural interpretation as an area of the underlying man-
ifold. With the previous section in mind this suggest that the operator pD q2
is somehow related to the Einstein-Hilbert action.
    Let us go into some details. Consider a 4-dimensional, Riemannian spin-
geometry described by the real, even spectral triple pA, D, H q where A is a
commutative C  -algebra. The Eucledian Einstein-Hilbert action on M can
be computed directly from D. It is proportional to the Wodzicki residue of
the inverse square of the Dirac operator D [37]. If we denote by T r the
Dixmier trace and define the noncommutative integral by

                                  f : T r f |D |4

one has                             »
                            D 

          ?
                                            M

where dv  gd4 x is the volume form and R is the scalar curvature. It
is in this sense that one may interpret the Einstein-Hilbert action as the
”two-dimensional measure of a four manifold”, the ”area” of M [38].
    This resembles the findings of the previous section where we saw that the
operator D2 has a natural interpretation in terms of a global area-squared
operator over an underlying manifold. If we ignore the obvious issue of ’area’
vs. ’area-squared’ one may speculate whether there is some deeper relation
between the operator D2 and the Einstein-Hilbert action.
    These considerations entail an interesting interpretation of the spectral
action of D . Consider the quantity

                             T r exppsD2 q ,                             (73)

where s is a real parameter, and let us perform a formal calculation to obtain

sense. However, we know that the initial quantity (73) is well defined. This
formal calculations shows that the spectral action (73) has the form of a
formal Feynman integral where the expression

                                                D2 δ∇

plays the role of a classical action.


9     Including the sequences tanu as dynamical
      variables
Up till this point we have constructed the spectral triple pB , D , H q and
related it to Quantum Gravity. We have shown that it contains information
of the Poisson brackets of canonical gravity and that it partly incorporates
diffeomorphism invariance. Two questions remains to be addressed:

    1. The spectral triple relies on the divergent sequence tai u. What struc-
       ture does this sequence represent and how do we deal with it?

    2. How do we incorporate the remaining diffeomorphisms contained in the
       group diffp△q.

  One solution to the first question would be to fix the sequence tai u in a
manner which counts a partition of an edge with a factor 21 . However, we

                                                    53
will argue that there may be another solution which is more natural. This
section is concerned with this issue.
    In section 5 we demonstrated that the triple pB , D , H q has a natural
interpretation in terms of Poisson brackets of canonical gravity. In this pic-
ture the Dirac type operator D , including the sequence tai u, is a linear sum
of the flux operators involving the densitised vielbein operator, see equation
(56). This suggest an interpretation of the parameters ai in terms of the
determinant of the vielbein

                                   ai  detpeam q .

That the sequence tai u carries metric information also comes out of the
discussion in subsection 4.5 where we relate the sequence tai u to the scaling
behaviour of the construction.
    Thirdly, in section 7 we found that the square of D has the form of an
integral over the underlying manifold. Here, the measure involved in this
integral is given by the sequence tai u.
    This suggests, as a possible solution to the first question, that we should
include the sequence tai u in the construction as dynamical variables. If the
sequence tai u has a metric origin, then it seems natural to try to integrate
over these degrees of freedom.
    Therefore we extend the spectral triple pB , D , H q to include the se-
quence tak u as dynamical variables. By doing this we obtain a new triple,
denoted pBt , Dt , Ht q, which is a fibration of triples pB , D , H q over the space
of permissible sequences tak u. It turns out that there is a way to obtain this
which leaves the spectral triple pBt , Dt , Ht q with very few free parameters.
    This section gives a presentation of ideas and methods used to construct
the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q. A detailed account of the construction will be pre-
sented elsewhere.
    To emphasise the dependency on the sequence tai u we shall in the follow-
ing write Dpai q instead of D .

9.1     The space of permissible sequences tai u
We would like to think of the parameters ai as a coordinates in a space H of
permissible sequences tai u (that is, sequences that satisfy the condition given
by (42)) and to define a Dirac operator on this space. Clearly H  R8 . The
sequence tai u is characterised by the condition that it diverges sufficiently

                                          54
fast. This means that the inverse sequence ta
                                             i u converges towards zero:
                                               1


                      lim a
                           i  0 sufficiently fast .

                                                                         (75)
                       i

This convergency condition is easier to work with than condition (42) since
convergent sequences can be understood in terms of a Hilbert space structure.
Therefore, in a first step we consider L2 -sequences. That is, sequences

                           txk u  px1 , . . . , xn, . . .q P R8
which satisfy
                                          ¸
                            }txk u}2 :        x2k   8.                  (76)
                                           k

The space of sequences satisfying (76) is an infinite dimensional, real, sepa-
rable Hilbert space which we also denote H.
    The exact relationship between vectors txk u in H and the sequences tak u
satisfying condition (42) will be determined in the following.
    In order to construct a Dirac operator on H we first need a Hilbert space
structure over H. The goal is to construct a spectral triple over H.
    The techniques used to construct L2 pH q and the corresponding spectral
                                                                             
triple are essentially the same techniques we used to construct the space A
and the triple pB , D , H q. The following is based on ideas by Higson and
Kasparov, see [25].
    The strategy is to consider first finite dimensional subspaces Hn of H,
corresponding Hilbert spaces L2 pHn q and structure maps
                      : L2 pH q Ñ L2 pH q ,
                    Pm,n                                    n¤m
                              n         m

between Hilbert spaces. Next step is to construct a spectral triple over each
space Hn , ensure compatibility with the structure maps Pm,n   and finally
obtain a triple over H by taking the limit n Ñ 8.
   There are two potential difficulties with this strategy:
   • The spaces Hn are non-compact. The construction of the spectral triple
     pB, D , Hq relies strongly on the fact that G is compact. This is a
     necessary condition to construct the structure maps P  (24) between
     Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we used the fact that the constant function
     is square integrable. This is no-longer the case when the underlying
     space is non-compact.

                                            55
   • The Dirac type operator, which we aim to construct, will have a non-
     compact resolvent. This is the same problem we encountered when
     we constructed the operator D and a problem which will always arise
     when one constructs a Dirac like operator on an infinite dimensional
     space (see also [25]). This problem was solved in section 3 by intro-
     ducing the parameters tai u, whose presence is the very reason why we
     now wish to construct the extended triple pBt , Dt , Ht q. Therefore, it
     appears that we are in danger of a circular argument: Certainly, we do
     not wish to introduce yet another infinite sequence to ensure a well be-
     haved Dirac operator acting on L2 pH q entailing yet another extension
     of pBt , Dt , Ht q and so forth.

    It turns out that there exist a way to construct the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q
which avoids these two technical pitfalls.
    The first problem is related to the fact the canonical map from Hn to Hm
is given by ξ Ñ ξ b 1n,m , where 1n,m is the identity function on the m  n
dimensional orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm . However, the function
1n,m is not a L2 -function and therefore the canonical map is not a map
between Hilbert spaces. We can remedy this defect by finding a suitable L2 -
function φn,m to replace the constant function 1n,m . The choice of function
φn,m is restricted by the requirement that it must lie in the kernel of the
Dirac type operator, which we wish to construct, when this is restricted to
the orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm .
    The second problem is related to the fact that we are dealing with an
infinite dimensional space. To solve this problem we modify the canonical
algebra of functions on Hn to include operators which project onto finite
dimensional subspaces.

9.2    A spectral triple over R8
We first consider finite dimensional subspaces Hn  Rn embedded in H by

                Hn Q px1 , . . . , xn q Ñ px1 , . . . , xn , 0, . . .q P H .

Before we proceed with the construction we introduce some notation and

which is a real, separable Hilbert space over H.
   Note that, as mentioned in the previous section, the Gauss distributions
play the same role in the construction as the constant function did in the
construction of H . This solves the first pitfall mentioned above.
   Since we wish to construct a Dirac type operator we need the Clifford
bundle. We define
                       L2 pH, ClpH qq : lim L2 pHn , ClpHn qq ,
                                            Ñ
where we have used the unital embedding ClpHn q Ñ ClpHm q, n m.
   We identify ClpHn q with the exterior product Λ Hn and define the oper-
ators
             extpeq   exterior multiplication by e on ΛHn ,
             intpeq   interior multiplication by e on ΛHn ,
              c peq  extpeq  intpeq .
which means that c peq is Clifford multiplication with e and c peq is Clifford
multiplication with e except that e2  1 and not e2  1. Furthermore, one
easily checks that tc peq, c pequ  0.

Define the operator Dn on L2 pHn , ClpHn qq by

This operator is known as the Bott-Dirac operator and its construction is
due to Higson and Kasparov [25]. It is proven in [25] that it is self adjoint
with compact resolvent. It satisfies
                                 Dn φ1,n px1 , . . . , xn q  0 .
In fact, the kernel of Dn is one dimensional and given by the function
φ1,n px1 , . . . , xn q. From this we get that
                                    pD pξ qq  D pξ q
                                  Pn,m n         m

and we obtain a self adjoint unbounded operator D on L2 pH, ClpH qq.
   The square of Dn is

where N is the operator which assigns a differential form its degree. The first
part of (79) is the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian which has the spectrum
0, 2{α, 4{α, . . ..
    As anticipated, the operator D does not have compact resolvent since
the group of all finite perturbations of N acts on its spectrum. A possible
solution to this problem is to modify the canonical algebra of functions acting
on L2 pH, ClpH qq. In stead of functions on L2 pH, ClpH qq we consider instead
functions on finite subspaces of L2 pH, ClpH qq and extend these to the full
Hilbert space by tensoring them with projection onto Gauss functions. Thus,
effectively we include cut-off’s in the algebra. This will ensure that the
resolvent of D, understood in terms of an interaction with the algebra, is
compact.
    Define
                    Φn,m : 1Hn b Pφn,m P BpL2 pHm q, Clpmqq ,
where Pφn,m is the orthogonal projection onto φn,m in Hn,m . Let An be
the algebra of operators in L2 pHn , ClpHn qq generated by tensor products of
elements in C0 pRq b Clp1q and Φk,l . Note that An embeds in Am , n m, by

In particular, A consist of operators on L2 pH, ClpH qq. Since the operators
in A contain a cut-down to the Gauss distribution from a certain point on,
we see that pA, D, L2 pH, ClpH qqq is a spectral triple since

                           apλ  D q1 ,          a P A ,λ R R

is a compact operator.
    Note that the semi-finite trick with the Clifford bundle, which worked
for the spaces of connections does not seem to work in this case, since the
kernel of D is one dimensional. Therefore there is no symmetry which can
be discarded of.

9.3      θ-summability
We would like to interpret condition (76) in terms of θ-summability of the
operator Dpai q . That is, we wish to establish a relation between sequences
txi u satisfying (76) and sequences taiu which leave
                                                     
                               T r exp D2pai q                        (80)

finite. Thus, we seek a function

                                      f : R8 Ñ R8

which satisfies
                                      
                  T r exp D2pai q       8  f ptai uq P l2pNq .       (81)

    This emphasis on θ-summability has a clear physical motivation. In sec-
tion 8 we noted that the quantity (80) has the form of a path integral. In
this light θ-summability simply means that this path integral is finite.

9.4      The U p1q-case
As a toy example let us consider the U p1q-case and the simplified operator
D1 pai q on U p1q8 which is the limit of operators of the form

                         Dn1 : D1        a2 D2     ...   an Dn ,

consider expression (80) and calculate

we see that, for G  U p1q and for the modified operator, θ-summability of
D1 pai q is directly related to the Hilbert space condition

This means that the sequence tai u is related to the Hilbert state txi u P H

9.5    The triple pBt , Dt, Ht q
We are now ready to combine the two spectral triples pB , D , H q and
pA, D, L2pH, ClpH qqq. A point txn u in H gives a θ-summable spectral triple
on B via the Dirac operator on H defined by the sequence f 1 ptxn uq. Let
us denote this Dirac operator by Df 1 ptxn uq . We define the operator Dt acting
on
                         Ht : L2 pH, ClpH qq b H
by

       Dt pξ b η qptxn uq
                        
                D pξ q b η ptxn uq p1qdegpξq ξ b Df  ptx uq pη qptxn uq , (84)

where degpξ q means the degree of ξ with respect to the degree in CLpH q.
   One of the requirement that this defines a semi-finite spectral triple over
A b B : Bt is that
                                 , for all a P Bt ,
                            a
                          1 Dt2
is τ -compact, where τ is a trace defined in (44) tensored with the trace on
B pL2 pH, ClpH qqq where B denotes the bounded operators.
    We see that this requirement collide with the following symmetry prop-
erty: All a P Bt are from a certain step of the form

                                   1 b Pφn,8

and therefore the operator
                                      a
                                    1 Dt2
is invariant under symmetries permuting all coordinates bigger than n.
    In order to remedy this we modify the construction of the spectral triple
pA, D, L2pH, ClpH qqq slightly. This modification is based on the observation
that the parameter α in the Gauss distribution φα pxq is in fact a free pa-
rameter. Further, there are an infinite number of these free parameters in
the construction of the triple pA, D, L2 pH, ClpH qqq, one for each dimension
in H. Let us denote these with tαi u. By choosing these parameters carefully
we can solve the problem mentioned above.
    For Dt to have a T r-compact resolvent its eigenvalues must approach
infinity. However, for each copy of G we know that its eigenvalues scale with

                                       61
pαiq1. Thus, if we require the sequence tαi u to satisfy
                                 lim αi  0 ,
                                 iÑ8

then the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q may be spectral.
    Let us pause to comment on this idea. It appears that we have sim-
ply exchanged one infinite sequence of free parameters tai u with another
infinite sequence tαi u. However, we suggest that the sequence tαi u is not ar-
bitrary but should be determined completely from symmetry considerations.
The idea is that the αi ’s represent an “average background” over which the
parameters ai are allowed to fluctuate. Therefore, we suggest to choose a
specific sequence tαi u satisfying the following requirements:
   • Copies of G which correspond to the same level in the projective system
     of graphs should be assigned the same αi ’s.

   • Given two copies of G where one copy G2 corresponds to a subdivision
     of the edge associated to the other copy G1 , then the corresponding
     parameters α1 , α2 should satisfy

                                         α2 
                                                α1
                                                   .
                                                2

    The first point reflects a rotational symmetry within each graph. The
second point is related to the scaling properties of the construction: a division
of a line segment corresponds to a factor 12 (see section 4.5 and the discussion
of the role of the parameters tai u).
    To implement this we enumerate the barycentric subdivisions with k and
introduce the modified Gauss distributions
                                                 
                        φ pxq  pπα q { exp
                                         1 4         x2     ,
                         k           k
                                                       2αk
where

                                αk  2k α .                                (85)

This means that we associate to each edge in the simplicial complexes a
parameter αk . In the initial complex each edge is associated the parameter
α0  α. Edges arising through the first barycentric subdivision are then
associated the parameter α1  α{2 and so forth.

                                         62
    Consider now the triple pA, D, L2 pH, ClpH qqq constructed with with these
new Gauss distributions. This means that the Hilbert space embeddings (77)
are modified together with the Bott-Dirac operator (78) which is now of the
form                              

subdivisions involved in the graph to which Dn is associated, N being the
total number of barycentric subdivisions. The second sum runs over the
number of edges within a barycentric subdivision.
    One now repeats the above construction leading to the operator (84), now
with the modified Bott-Dirac operator.
    The details concerning the spectral properties of the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q
will appear elsewhere.

10      Distances on A
On a Riemannian spin-geometry the Dirac operator D contains the geomet-
rical information of the manifold M. In particular, distances can be formu-
lated purely algebraically due to Connes [1]. Given two points x, y P M their
distance is given by
                                                                  (
             dpx, y q        sup     |f pxq  f pyq| }rD, f s} ¤ 1 .       (86)
                          f C8 M
                          P     p q
On a Noncommutative Geometry the state space replaces the notion of
points. It is possible to extend the notion of distance to the state space
by generalising (86).
    In the present case it is natural to ask whether the Dirac-like operator
                                                      
D introduces a metric structure over the space A and if so, how distances
should be interpreted in this setting.
    The possibility for a distance between smooth connections in A and some
closure hereof was first considered in [20]. There, however, the distance
between two smooth connections was found to be infinite, since two smooth
connections will differ on infinitely many different loops. This entails a finite
contribution to the distance from infinitely many copies of G.
    In the present setting the situation is different due to the sequence tai u.
The role of the ai ’s is to assign a weight to each copy of G and therefore to

scale the corresponding distance on G. Therefore, given two points in A
their distance

                                                                                       (87)

where we choose }} as the operator norm on matrices in Ml pCq, is well defined
and finite, even for ∇1 , ∇2 P A. This is related to the fact that although our
                                                      
geometry on A is infinite dimensional it assigns A zero volume.
    The distance (87), when it is applied to smooth connections, is not inde-
pendent of the embedding h of simplicial complexes into triangulations.
                                              
    With a metric structure on the space A it is natural to ask which con-
nections are ’close’ to each other. Clearly, this depends on the choice of the
sequence tai u. However, it is possible to give some general remarks indepen-
dently of this choice.
                            
    Recall that the space A is the limit space limn Gn in an appropriate sense.
The distance between ∇1 , ∇2 P AKi is simply the sum of geodesic distances
on each copy of G, weighted with the appropriate parameters ai . In the
previous section we found that the role of the parameters tai u is to scale
the different copies of G according to their location in the projective system
of simplicial complexes. The larger ai ’s corresponds to short distances, now
with respect to some manifold. This means that the the distance between
∇1 and ∇2 is larger if the connections differ mostly on those copies of G
which are assigned small ai ’s. Correspondingly, the distance between ∇1 and
∇2 is smaller if ∇1 and ∇2 differ mostly on those copies of G which are
assigned large ai ’s. Therefore, in general, the two generalised connections
will be ’close’ to each other if they differ mostly at short scales.
    Via Levi-Civita connections we can interpret equation (87) as a distance
between geometries14 . Again we can say that the distance between two ge-
ometries depends on the scale on which they differ.
    Let us consider the Abelian case G  U p1q and two points ∇1 , ∇2 in A .
                                                                                

In this case ∇1 and ∇2 are given by sequences of angles tθi1 u and tθi2 u where
each angle θij corresponds to points expp2πiθij q on the i’th copies of U p1q. Let
us for simplicity choose a coordinate system on Gn so that θij corresponds to
the parameter ai . Thus, for example, if we consider G  G parametrised by
angles φ1 and φ2 we choose
                            θ1  φ1     φ2 ,     θ2  φ1  φ2
  14
   In this case, however, the distance formula will be degenerate since different geometries
may have identical Levi-Civita connections.

                                            64
and so forth. Then the distance between ∇1 and ∇2 reads
                                       ¸ 2k
                       dp∇1 , ∇2 q              |θk1  θk2 | ,
                                       k
                                         ak 2π

which should be read together with the condition (75).
    The notion of a distance on a space of connections is not a new one but
was discussed already by Feynman [39] and Singer [40]. See also [41] and ref-
erences herein. However, these papers all deal with distances between gauge
equivalence classes of connections. The construction presented in this paper
is quite different from these previous works since two connections which differ
by a gauge transformation will, in general, have a non vanishing distance.


11     Discussion
Before we end this paper we give a few remarks concerning the physical
interpretation of the constructions presented.

11.1     The quantization scheme
As already mentioned, the shift to Ashtekar variables permits a formulation
of General Relativity which is close to ordinary Yang-Mills theory. In the
Hamilton formulation the theory involves a configuration space of connec-
tions corresponding to ordinary SU p2q Yang-Mills theory. The essential dif-
ference between General Relativity and Yang-Mills theory lies in the algebra
of constraints which encode the symmetries of the theory. For General Rel-
ativity the constraints encode diffeomorphism invariance. These constraints
are closely related to the foliation of the spacetime M according to

                              ΣR ÑM ,                                    (88)

where Σ is a 3-dimensional hypersurface. Loosely stated, the constraints
encode information about diffeomorphisms within and perpendicular to Σ.
Therefore, the key question in any quantization procedure of gravity is the
implementation of diffeomorphism invariance in the construction.
   To quantize a constrained theory there are in general two standard ap-
proaches:


                                       65
  a) To eleminate first, at a classical level, the constraints and thereby find
     the reduced phase space of the theory. The quantization procedure is
     applied to the reduced phase space.

  b) To construct first quantum kinematics for the full phase space by ig-
     noring the constraints, then construct operators corresponding to the
     classical constraints and finally solve the quantum constraints to obtain
     the physical Hilbert space.

Loop Quantum Gravity follows the second approach which is due to Dirac
(see [42] for a detailed exposition). In section 5.2 we demonstrated that the
spectral triple pB , D , H q involves a representation of the Poisson algebra
(55) of General Relativity. In our interpretation, the construction should
be understood as a quantization scheme which lies somewhere between the
approaches a) and b).
    First of all, there is nothing in the geometrical construction that corre-
sponds directly to the constraint algebra of General Relativity. However, in
section 6 we related the Hilbert space H to the diffeomorphism invariant
Hilbert space Hdif f of Loop Quantum Gravity. The difference between H
and Hdif f is the group diff(△) of discrete diffeomorphisms on the system of
simplicial complexes. Therefore, we think of the spectral triple pB , D , H q
as a geometrical construction describing a quantization procedure of gravity
on a Hilbert space which corresponds to a partial solution to the (spatial)
diffeomorphism constraint. What remains then, in this picture, is the imple-
mentation of the remaining diffeomorphisms encoded in the discrete group
diff(△).
    The second point in which our construction differs from canonical quan-
tum gravity is the issue of time. Clearly, a foliation of the manifold is essential
for canonical gravity since the Hamilton formulation is based on a choice of
an explicit time direction. In contrast to this, the construction presented here
does not a priori involve a foliation of space-time. Further, the dimension of
the underlying space is completely free. The only restriction is the choice of
symmetry group, which, for now, has to be compact15 . In particular, we can
consider triangulations of a 4-dimensional manifold.
    These observations suggest two possible interpretations of the construc-
tion: First, the construction may be interpreted as a completely covariant
construction in four dimensions, involving the full, four-dimensional group
  15
       The case G  SOp1, 3q, for example, is not permitted.


                                             66
of diffeomorphisms. This interpretation leaves no room for a foliation and
thus no Hamiltonian constraint. Therefore, a dynamical principle replacing
the Hamiltonian constraint must be sought elsewhere. This interpretation
implies that the group G corresponds to four-dimensional local Lorentz rota-
tions. Next, if the loop algebra lives on a four-dimensional manifold, then the
interpretation of the Dirac type operator D in terms of canonical quantum
gravity must involve a flux operator FaS where S is now a three-dimensional
hypersurface. Further, the interaction between D and the algebra of loops
should be understood as a four-dimensional operator algebra containing a
representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity as a kind of sub-
algebra.
    Alternatively, we may interpret the construction as fundamentally three-
dimensional, with G equal to SU p2q. This interpretation does not necessarily
mean that we consider a foliation of space-time according to (88). Rather,
we would like time to emerge naturally from the construction.
    Indeed, let us end this discussion with the remark that the philosophy of
Noncommutative Geometry is to seek a time within the algebraic construc-
tion rather than imposing it a priori. Here we think of the Tomita-Takesaki
theory [43] which identifies a one-parameter automorphism group uniquely
up to inner automorphisms. It is an interesting question whether this group
of modular automorphisms is nontrivial in this or perhaps some similar con-
struction. If the answer is in the affirmative, then this might provide us with
an alternative to the foliation and thereby with a new dynamical principle.

11.2     The group diffp△q and the question of constraints
Regardless of how one interprets the spectral triple pB , D , H q it is clear
that one should seek to obtain invariance under the discrete group diffp△q of
graph preserving diffeomorphisms.
    Traditionally, given some space M, invariance under a symmetry group
G is obtained by taking the the quotient

                                    M {G .

However, Noncommutative Geometry gives an alternative approach to quo-
tient spaces. A simple example is the space of two points identified. Within
Noncommutative Geometry this setup is described via two by two matrices
where the off-diagonal entries represent the identification of the points. This

                                      67
entails a noncommutative algebra and a structure which, ultimately, leads
to the Higgs mechanism in the noncommutative formulation of the Standard
Model.
    In the case of gravity the relevant symmetry group is the diffeomorphism
group. This group is probably too large for an application of the noncom-
mutative approach. However, in the present setup we have instead the much
smaller group diffp△q and one could speculate if the machinery of Noncom-
mutative Geometry of quotient spaces could be successfully applied. This
idea differs fundamentally from a Dirac-type quantization procedure.
    Thus, what we suggest is to obtain a formal diffeomorphism invariance
by considering the semi-direct product of the loop algebra with the group
diffp△q
                                  B diffp△q ,
and thereafter building a spectral triple with an associated Hilbert space
L2 pAq b L2 pdiffp△qq. Presumably, such a construction will give rise to addi-
tional degrees of freedom through fluctuations around the Dirac type opera-
tor.

11.3     Background independence
                                            
In section 6.2 we argued that the space A should be viewed as a space of
connections subjected to a gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism group. Naively,
it appears that this gauge fixing does not involve any choice of metric or
background ’field’ on the manifold. Let us comment on this.
    The construction in section 2 depends primarily on the initial simplicial
complex Ko . The idea is that the basic data entering the construction is the
topology of the corresponding manifold. The initial complex gives rise to an
initial triangulation To via a homeomorphism

                                h:KÑM.

This initial triangulation introduces a metric structure on M. The embed-
ding A ãÑ A will, of course, depend crucially on the triangulation and in
              

particular on the homeomorphism h. However, the construction and spec-
trum of the Dirac-type operator is independent of h and so is its interaction
with the algebra and the construction of the Hilbert space. In fact, the no-
tion of a manifold may be left out altogether. It is only the identification of
  
A as a space of generalised connections that requires a manifold.

                                      68
    Another question is the dependency on the sequence tai u. The Dirac
type operator D depends crucially on this sequence as does its spectrum.
Thus, one may argue that some degree of background dependency enters the
construction with the sequence tai u. In section 9 we attempted to free the
construction of this dependency by making the ai ’s dynamical. The price
paid, however, is the introduction of a new sequence tαi u determining the
Gauss distributions. Therefore, it seems that the construction, whether we
consider the triple pB , D , H q or the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q, does posses some
degree of dependency on a parameter space which one may interpret in terms
of a background. The exact nature and implication of this dependency is to
be clarified.

11.4      Additional degrees of freedom
The construction of the triples pB , D , H q and pBt , Dt , Ht q takes canonical
quantum gravity as its point of departure. Thus, both spectral triples are a
priori of purely gravitational origin. However, there are several indications
that the framework presented in this paper contains additional degrees of
freedom, both bosonic and fermionic.
    First, recall that the framework of Noncommutative Geometry generally
involves fermionic degrees of freedom since it involves a Dirac type operator
acting on a Hilbert space16 . The ’fermions’ involved in the spectral triple
pB , D, Hq are clearly very different from the fermions of the Standard
Model since they live on a space of connections. However, this space of con-
nections is of course linked to an underlying manifold. A classical limit will
presumable involve some kind of delta function on the space of connections
(see next section for a discussion hereof) and therefore leave only space-time
degrees of freedom for the fermions. Therefore the interesting question is
what structures may emerge from these ’fermions’ in a classical limit.
    Furthermore, during the construction of the the triple pB , D , H q we
found that the CAR algebra emerged in an almost canonical fashion. It
seems plausible that almost any construction of a Dirac type operator on
an infinite dimensional space will naturally entail an infinite dimensional
Clifford bundle which, in turn, leads to the CAR algebra. Thus, it seems
that Noncommutative Geometry provides us with a mechanism which equips
  16
    For a commutative algebra the underlying space is a Riemannian geometry and the
Dirac operator acts on a Hilbert space of spinors. In the noncommutative formulation of
the Standard Model the Hilbert space is labelled by the fermions in the Standard Model.

                                          69
a purely gravitational setting, the construction of a Dirac type operator on
an infinite dimensional space of field configurations, with basic elements of
fermionic Quantum Field Theory. In section 4.1 we found that the Hilbert
space H factorizes into
                             H  H,b b H,f ,
where the CAR algebra acts on H,f . This shows that H naturally involves
both bosonic and fermionic sectors.
   Finally, let us consider the possibility that the noncommutativity of the
loop algebra will generate an additional bosonic sector through the inner
automorphisms of the algebra. To explain this consider first a classical finite-
dimensional, real spectral triple pA, D, H q. A noncommutative algebra A
contains inner automorphisms of the form

                           αu pxq  uxu     x P A ,
where u is an arbitrary element of the unitary group, uu  u u  1. A
change of representation of the algebra A from π to π  αu1 is equivalent to
the replacement of the Dirac operator D by

                         D̃  D    A1    JA1 J 1 ,                        (89)

where A1  urD, u s is a noncommutative one-form, and where J is a real
structure. In the noncommutative formulation of the Standard Model cou-
pled to gravity [2] the entire bosonic sector of the Standard Model, including
the Higgs boson, is generated by ° this type of fluctuations of the Dirac oper-
ator by a general one-form A1  ai rD, bi s with ai , bi P A.
    This mechanism is general. The interesting question is what kind of
bosonic sector the inner automorphisms of the spectral triple pB , D , H q
will generate.

   The general idea behind these remarks is that pure Quantum Gravity may,
as a ”free” spin-off, contain matter degrees of freedom. Thus, we believe
that one should not attempt to couple matter degrees of freedom to the
construction presented in this paper but rather hope to see matter emerge
dynamically.




                                        70
12      Conclusion and outlook
In this paper we establish a link between the mathematics of Noncommu-
tative Geometry and the field of canonical quantum gravity. We construct
a spectral triple pB , D , H q over a space of connections and show that the
Poisson structure of General Relativity, formulated in terms of loop variables,
is encoded in the interaction between the Dirac type operator D and the
loop algebra B . The Hilbert space H corresponds to a partial solution of
the diffeomorphism constraint of canonical gravity. The inner product of H
involves a functional integral over a space of connections and the Dirac type
operator D has the form of a global functional derivation. Consequently, we
interpret the triple in terms of a non-perturbative, background independent,
quantum field theory.

    The construction is based on a projective system of simplicial complexes.
The simplicial complexes are related through repeated barycentric subdivi-
sions. The triple pB , D , H q is the limit of spectral triples formulated at
the level of finite simplicial complexes. Since the operation of barycentric
subdivision is countable the limit triple is separable and spectral.

    The square of the Dirac type operator has, in terms of canonical quan-
tum gravity, a natural interpretation as global operator related to the area
operators known in Loop Quantum Gravity. We interpret the operator pD q2
in terms of an action and show that the spectral action of D has the form
of a Feynman path integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.

    The construction of the spectral triple pB , D , H q differs from a tradi-
tional canonical quantization procedure of General Relativity in the way the
group of diffeomorphisms is treated. Rather than encoding the symmetries
of the classical theory in a set of constraints the construction works directly
on a Hilbert space H which corresponds to a partial solution of the (spa-
tial) diffeomorphism constraint. The existence of the spectral triple relies
on a particular split of the diffeomorphism group into a countable and an
over-countable part. The over-countable part is discarded of; the group of
countable diffeomorphisms is the group diffp△q of diffeomorphisms between
simplicial complexes. This means that the Poisson algebra of General Rela-
tivity is represented on the separable Hilbert space H .

                                       71
   The Dirac type operator D depends on an infinite sequence of parameters
tai u. These parameters determine the scaling behaviour of the construction.
We believe that a correct understanding and treatment of these parameters
is essential. In this paper we propose a possible way to treat the sequence
tai u. Since the sequence is seen to have metric origin we propose to include
it as a dynamical variable in the construction. This leads to a new triple,
denoted pBt , Dt , Ht q, which includes the spectral triple pB , D , H q as well
as a sector permitting the sequence tai u to vary. The triple pBt , Dt , Ht q is
constructed to ensure that the operator D is θ-summable. Thus, we permit
only sequences tai u which leaves the spectral action of D finite.

    Furthermore, the Dirac type operator D defines a distance on the un-
derlying space of connections. Clearly, this distance depends strongly on the
sequence tai u. However, we find that a general feature of this distance func-
tion is that two connections are ”close” if they differ mostly at short scales.

    It is possible to read this paper in a more conservative way, discarding the
role of Noncommutative Geometry and reading it as a reformulation of Loop
Quantum Gravity. If we ignore the construction of the Dirac type operator
D and focus instead on the algebra B and the Hilbert space H , with-
out the Clifford bundle, and consider the algebra of the vectors Eˆji , then, as
already mentioned, we obtain a representation of the Poisson algebra of Gen-
eral Relativity on a separable Hilbert space. Therefore, this Hilbert space, let
us denote it H1 , replaces the otherwise non-separable Hilbert space L2 pA q
                                                                              a

known as the kinematical Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity. In Loop
Quantum Gravity the kinematical Hilbert space is the Hilbert space on which
the constraints of General Relativity are defined. Thus, one could formulate
the complete set of constraints of General Relativity in terms of operators
acting on the Hilbert space H1 . First, as explained in section 6, the Hilbert
space H1 has an action of the reduced set of diffeomorphisms diffp△q. There-
fore the spatial diffeomorphism constraint should be formulated in terms of
the group diffp△q. Next, one may likewise formulate the Gauss and Hamil-
tonian constraints of Loop Quantum Gravity on H1 . The central message
here is that it is possible to formulate Loop Quantum Gravity in terms of
a separable kinematical Hilbert space. It is an interesting question whether
this observation will have an impact on any of the challenges facing Loop
Quantum Gravity.

                                        72
    Let us finally remind the reader that the focus of this paper is the physi-
cal significance of the spectral triple pB , D , H q. The detailed mathematical
analysis of the triple is given in [22].

Outlook

    More analysis is needed to understand the physical and mathematical
significance of the spectral triple pB , D , H q. First of all it is imperative
to understand the role and proper treatment of the sequence tai u since this
sequence is central to the existence of the triple. Let us here just say that
the sequence tai u should be understood in connection with the group of
diffeomorphisms diffp△q since elements hereof are given by rearrangement of
the parameters ai . Having said this, let us list other issues which we think
deserves attention.
    - First, we have seen that the spectral action resembles a Feynman path
      integral. We believe that the computation and analysis of the spectral
      action is the most interesting task to address at the present stage of the
      project. Here one should consider the Dirac operator which involves
      the inner fluctuations described in section 11.
    - A prime issue for any theory or framework for non-perturbative Quan-
      tum Gravity is the formulation of a semi-classical limit. In the present
      case the aim is to obtain a classical limit which involves not only a
      smooth geometry - characterised by a commutative -algebra - but to
      obtain a limit which includes an additional matrix factor of the type
      that characterises the almost commutative algebra in Connes’ formula-
      tion of the Standard Model. Indeed, since Connes’ geometrical realiza-
      tion of the Standard Model is so attractive and powerful as it stands,
      it remains to understand why the algebra which lies at the heart of
      this formulation should have this particular noncommutativity. We
      suggest that the source of this noncommutativity lies in pure Quan-
      tum Gravity. Recall that the loop algebra B is essentially an almost
      commutative algebra over the space A of connections. That is, it is
      a product of smooth functions over A and a matrix factor Ml pCq. If
      we think of a classical limit as the emergence of a single geometry it
      seems reasonable to expect something close to a delta function peaked
      around a connection ∇. However, when we apply the loop algebra on a

                                       73
        delta function it reduces to the matrix factor Ml pCq or some subalgebra
        hereof. Furthermore, if we keep in mind that the construction of the
        spectral triple pB , D , H q involves a choice of a basepoint17 , then it
        seems possible that a similar construction which does not involve this
        basepoint will entail a smearing of the matrix factor over the manifold.
        Thus, we speculate that the matrix factor behind the noncommutative
        formulation of the Standard Model emerges in the classical limit from
        the noncommutative algebra of holonomy loops.
        We suspect this issue to be related to the calculation of the spectral
        action. However, one should also investigate whether ideas from Loop
        Quantum Gravity concerning coherent states [44] can be applied.

       - The question about time is fundamental to any general covariant theory
         since such theories have no preferred time flow. This situation is even
         more complicated when one attempts to include quantum theory since
         this will presumable lead to a theory which involves some notion of
         superpositions of geometries and thus does not permit any notion of
         a predetermined time. A possible solution to this problem has been
         proposed by Connes (see for example [38]. See also [45] for similar
         ideas developed by Connes and Rovelli). The idea is that the concept
         of time is intimately linked to the noncommutativity of the algebra
         of observables of Quantum Gravity. Specifically, it is a fundamental
         property of von Neumann algebras that they possess a 1-parameter
         family of automorphisms which is unique up to inner automorphisms.
         Thus, the idea is that this group of automorphisms, the modular group,
         should be understood in terms of a time. It is therefore natural to ask
         whether the noncommutative -algebras introduced in this paper give
         rise to a nontrivial modular group and whether this can be interpreted
         as a time flow.
        Alternatively, one might try to exploit the fact that the construction
        presented in this paper is basically quantum mechanics on the group
        G taken infinitely many times. Here, each copy of G corresponds to a
        degree of freedom originating somewhere on the underlying manifold.
        Thus, one could consider the time evolution, with respect to one copy
        of G, given by the operator exppi∆tq where ∆ is the Laplace operator.

basepoint.

  This suggest that the unitary operator

                            U ptq : exppipD q2 tq

  may be thought of as a time evolution operator.

- The construction of the spectral triple pB , D , H q starts with a sim-
  plicial complex. It is an important question to determine the exact
  dependency of the triple on the choice of initial complex. For instance,
  consider two simplicial complexes K1 and K2 chosen so that their union
  is the barycentric subdivision of yet another simplicial complex K3 .
  Does the construction depend on whether one chooses K3 or the union
  of K1 and K2 as the initial complex? The answer is, a priori, yes, since
  the two choices will come with different sequences of parameters tai u.
  The exact nature of this dependency needs to be clarified. Clearly, the
  idea is that the spectral triple should depend only on topological data
  coming from the underlying manifold. A related issue is the merging
  of different spectral triples based on different simplicial complexes. By
  gluing complexes it should be possible to move from one topological
  setting to another. These issues are all connected with the sequence
  taiu and the group of diffeomorphisms in diffp△q.
- A related issue is the possibility to obtain a similar construction based
  on a different projective system of graphs. The choice of simplicial com-
  plexes (or, triangulations) and barycentric subdivisions seems natural
  but is not compulsory. In [22] we provide certain necessary require-
  ments for a system of graphs to be suitable for the construction of a
  spectral triple. These requirements leave room for projective systems
  of graphs which are not simplicial complexes. Again, more analysis is
  needed to determine the dependency of the final construction on dif-
  ferent choices of graphs. It is clear that a projective system of graphs
  must be countable in order to permit the construction of a spectral
  triple.

- It is desirable to be able to deal also with a non-compact gauge group
  such as SO p3, 1q. At present, the compactness of the gauge group is
  essential for the construction of the Hilbert space to work. Basically,
  we need the identity to be an L2 -function with respect to the Haar
  measure. One could speculate whether the techniques of Higson and

                                  75
  Kasparov [25] might be applied to resolve this issue. Here, the trick is
  to use a Dirac operator with a nontrivial square-integrable kernel and
  to define embeddings between Hilbert spaces via this kernel.

- One should further clarify the relation between the construction pre-
  sented here and Loop Quantum Gravity. In particular, it would be
  interesting to understand if there is a relation between the operator D
  and the Hamilton constraint. Here one should most likely consider the
  fluctuated version of D , with respect to inner automorphisms, since
  this operator involves also the loop algebra.

- It is an interesting question whether the construction presented in this
  paper has anything to say about nonperturbative gauge theory. Con-
  sider a single line segment and the sequence an  a0 2n , where n cor-
  responds to the number of subdivisions of the segment. This is a nat-
  ural sequence to consider but we know that the asymptotic behaviour
  an  2n is too weak for the Dirac type operator to have a compact
  resolvent. If we consider instead the sequence an  a0 p2 |ǫ|qn then
  D will have a compact resolvent as long as ǫ is non-zero. This setup is
  then extended to all line segments in the projective system of graphs.
  As long as ǫ is non-zero the corresponding spectral action of D is well
  defined and resembles a Feynman path integral over a space of connec-
  tions. The interesting question is what theory this object represents. It
  seems clear that it should be understood as a non-perturbative Quan-
  tum Field Theory involving a gauge field. The setup resembles lattice
  gauge theory with the crucial difference that a lattice spacing is ab-
  sent and that one does not have the freedom to choose an action. It
  would be interesting to calculate the spectral action and, subsequently,
  to take the limit ǫ Ñ 0. Presumably, this limit will lead to divergences
  since the operator D ceases to have compact resolvent when ǫ  0.
  One can speculate whether these divergences might correspond to the
  divergences found in perturbative Quantum Field Theory.

- Of course, the exact construction and analysis of the triple pBt , Dt , Ht q
  should be carried out. A publication with these details is under prepa-
  ration.

A     A spectral triple without the basepoint
The diffeomorphism invariance obtained so far only includes diffeomorphisms
which preserve the basepoint introduced in section 2. The role of the base-
point is to equip the algebra of loops with a product. Because the choice of
basepoint partly breaks diffeomorphism invariance we would like to obtain
a structure which avoids the basepoint. It turns out that such a construc-
tion does exist. Instead of the group structure of loops this more general
construction is based on a groupoid structure of path.
    Once again we start with an abstract simplicial complex K with vertices
tviu and edges tǫj u. Consider the Hilbert space
                        HK  L2 ptvi u  AK , Ml pCqq ,

where we recall that AK  GnpKq . For now we omit the Clifford bundle which
is not necessary for the construction and representation of the algebra.
    In fact, there are two natural algebras to consider. Denote by Ω the set of
loops in K with arbitrary basepoint and consider first the algebra generated
by these loops equipped with the product
                              "
                fL1  fL2 
                                  0       if basepoints differ
                                  fL1 L2 if basepoints coincide.


                                         77
Again we can construct a norm via the matrix norm on G and we obtain a
C  -algebra which we denote BΩ .
     The second option, which is perhaps more natural, is to consider paths in
K. Denote by P the set of paths in K and denote by BP the algebra generated
by such paths with a natural product. Clearly, BΩ ãÑ BP . Concretely, we
let the algebra BP be given by its representation which is as follows. Given
a path p that starts in v1 and ends in v2 we write
                                     "
                                                           if vj  v2
               pfp  ξ qpvj , ∇q        0
                                         ∇ppq  ξ pv1 , ∇q if vj  v2 ,

where ∇ppq is defined as in (11), just with a path instead of a loop.
   In this setup a path can now be seen as an operator which combines the
holonomy along the path with a matrix structure

                                         |vmyxvn|
and we notice that loops with arbitrary basepoint are found on the diagonal
of this matrix structure. Thus, a natural trace will pick out all the loops and
thereby, in terms of holonomy loops, the gauge covariant elements.
    The inner product on the Hilbert space HK also involves a sum over
vertices. The rest of the construction can be carried out in a similar manner
to the construction of the triple pB , D , H q.
    This formulation seems better suitable for a semi-classical limit since it
involves the points of the manifold, which, presumable, should emerge in
such a limit.


B     On diffeomorphism invariance
Although the Hilbert space L2 pA q does not have an action of the full dif-
                                         

feomorphism group it is possible to introduce a notion of analytic diffeomor-
phisms on L2 pA q via the space L2 pA q. This, in turn, allows us to extend
                                       a

the action of certain operators on L2 pA q to the larger Hilbert space L2 pA q
                                                                           a

and thereby introduce a notion of (analytic) diffeomorphism invariance for
these operators. This setup involves an embedding of general piecewise ana-
lytic graphs Γ into triangulations Ti coming from the projective system tKi u.
Therefore, the action of these operators on L2 pA q will depend on a choice
                                                   

of embedding. It is important to realize that this construction does not work

                                             78
for the operator D since we do not have a Clifford bundle over the space
L2 pA q.
      a

    The following should be read as a rough idea or strategy as to how one
introduces a notion of diffeomorphism invariance on L2 pA q, rather than a
                                                           

complete analysis.
    Let us go into details. Given an element ξΓ P L2 pA q associated to a
                                                         a

piece-wise analytic graph Γ we choose an embedding of a suitable simplicial
complex Ki
                               φ : Ki Ñ Ti ,
where Ti is a triangulation in M, so that Γ lies in Ti . Consider an operator
O on L2 pA q. This could for example be the Laplace operator. The action
           

of O on ξΓ is defined as
                                OpξΓq : φpOpφ1ξΓ qq .
If we map d : ξΓ Ñ ξdpΓq with a diffeomorphism d then the action of O
changes accordingly
                            OpξdpΓq q : φ1 pOppφ1 q1 ξΓ qq ,
where φ1 is a new embedding. We obtain the diagram
                       1
               ξΓ    ÝÑ
                     φ

                                 ξ

where d and d1 belong to diffp△q. To have a diffeomorphism invariant
state means that the state is invariant under diffp△q. This is exactly the
space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states mentioned in the previous
subsection. A diffeomorphism invariant operator O is an operator for which
the centre part of the diagram (90) commute
                                    ξ    ÝÑ Opξq
                                   d Ó   ö  d Ó
                                    ξ1   ÝÑ Opξ1 q
This reflects the simple observation that a loop is, by itself, not an observable
since it is not self-adjoint. Only the combination L L1 is self-adjoint,
exactly because it is invariant with respect to the symmetry group of the
loop.

                                           79
C        Symmetric states
In Quantum Field Theory the vacuum state is defined as the unique trans-
lational invariant state. In the present setting there are certain states which
display a high degree of symmetry and which may be thought in terms of a
ground state.
    Consider first the spectral triple pB , D , H q and the two states
      ψ0 p∇q  ψ0 pg1 , g2 , . . . , gn , . . .q  δG1 pidq  δG2 pidq  . . .  δGn pidq  . . . ,
and
                                              φ 0 p∇ q  1 .
Here δGn is the delta-function on the n’th copy of G and c is a constant. The
action of a loop L on the first state reads
                                        fL  ψ0 p∇q  ψ0 p∇q
for any L in B . This means that the entire algebra B collapses into the
identity on the state ψ0 . This corresponds to flat space. This state, however,
does not lie in the Hilbert space, nor in the domain of the operator D . In
contrast to this the state φ0 lies in the kernel of D . Both states ψ0 are
invariant under diffp△q since they are invariant under any permutation of
the argument pg1 , . . . , gn , . . .q.
    If we consider instead the spectral triple pBt , Dt , Ht q there are again two
states which are highly symmetric. Consider first
                              Ht Q Ψ0 p∇, x̄q  ψ0 p∇q b ξo px̄q ,
where
       ξ0 px̄q  ξ0 px1 , x2 , . . . , xn , . . .q  δx1 pα1 q  δx2 pα2 q  . . .  δxn pαn q  . . .
This state fixes the sequence tai u on the ’background’ sequence tαi u which
was, in section 9.5, fixed according to relation (85). Again, this states does
not lie in the domain of the Dirac operator Dt . Notice however, that by
choosing the parameters ai ’s according to relation (85) one obtains a Dirac
type operator D which is, up to an overall factor, invariant under a shift in
the parameters ai . Such a shift corresponds to a change of scale.
   Next, we may also consider the state
                               Ht Q Φ0 p∇, x̄q  φ0 p∇q b ηo px̄q ,

                                                    80
where
                   η0 px̄q  φ1 px1 q  φ2 px2 q  . . .  φn pxn q  . . .
Here φn pxn q is the Gauss distribution which we used to construct the triple
pBt , Dt, Ht q. Since the state η0 lies in the kernel of Da the state Φ0 lies in
the kernel of Dt .
