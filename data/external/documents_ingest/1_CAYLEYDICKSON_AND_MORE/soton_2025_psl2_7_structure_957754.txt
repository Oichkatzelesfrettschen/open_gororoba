                  INTO RIEMANN SURFACES
                             by Pablo Martm Garcia


 In this thesis we provide examples of a new approach to the field of finite geometries,
 namely by considering the conformal embedding of a hnite geometry into a Riemann
 surface. A hnite geometry is a particular arrangement of a finite number of points
 and lines satisfying some well known axioms. We will cover the hrst two examples
of the family of Hadamard designs, which are the Fano plane and the 3-biplane.

     Riemann surfaces and dessins are introduced and explained in chapter one. We
explore their common relationship to cocompact Puchsian groups and display some
results regarding the calculation of their automorphisms groups. We also describe
the three most common geometric representations of a dessin: those by Cori, James
and Walsh.

     Chapter two is divided into two different parts. In the first one we cover the
family of finite groups PSL{2,p)    where p is a prime number, particularly for the
cases where p e {5, 7,11}. In the second part of the chapter we introduce the family
of Hecke groups H'^ and their special congruence subgroups, with special regards
to the cases where g = 3 and g = 5.

    In chapter three we cover finite geometries and their properties. Projective
planes and biplanes are studied in diSFerent sections paying special attention to the
Fano plane as our chosen representative for the projective planes and the 3-biplane.

    Finally in chapter four we make extensive use of aU the preliminar material
by finding and describing several conformal embeddings of the Fano plane and
the 3-biplane into Riemann surfaces, especially into those Riemann surfaces with
automorphism group isomorphic to                  and that can be uniformized by a
special congruence subgroup of H'^.

     I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. David Singerman for all his help and
 immense support in the making of this thesis.

     Thanks are due to my advisor Prof. Gareth Jones, to Prof. J. M. Gamboa and
to Dr. Yolanda Fuertes for helpful comments and suggestions, and to my fellow
students, particularly to Dr. Catherine Kelk, Dr. Tom Barker, Dr. Edgar Possani
and Dr. Richard Congram, they made me feel at home and these three years would
not have been the same without them.

     I would also like to thank all my friends and family for their constant en-
couragement, especially Paula Mason, Lee Roden, Justin Budhram and Bob and
Margaret Turner. On the mathematical side Raquel Agueda and Roberto Canogar
played a key role in the early stages of my PhD, despite all the troubles the three
of us have gone through, this thesis is a proof that things are possible.

     I gratefully acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Coun-
cil, the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Southampton and Universidad
Complutense de Madrid for their financial support.

     Finally my gratitude is also due to my parents Bernardo and Teresa for their
continuous support and to Concha, my wife, for her encouragement, patience and
understanding. As plans with Concha were postponed and sacrifices made, I hope
this thesis is worth all her eSorts.

     A map, or more generally a dessin, is a particular arrangement of faces, vertices

 and edges that have a very rich and widely explored relationship with Riemann

 surfaces and Puchsian triangle groups. See for example [JSl], [Sch] and [Wal].

 The theory that originally covered conformal embeddings of maps into Riemann

 Surfaces, heis been progressively expanded to embrace an ever increasing class of

 subjects, such as anticonformal embeddings of hypermaps into Klein surfaces and

their relationship with N.E.C. triangle groups (see [BS] or [IS]). In chapter one

we introduce Riemann surfaces, Fuchsian groups, dessins and some of their prop-

erties and relationships, since they constitute the foundation stone of the examples

displayed in chapter four.


     It was first observed by Walsh [Wal] in 1975 that it is possible to embed the

incidence relation of the Fano plane as a map into a torus. In 1986 [Si4] Singerman

described another embedding of the Fano plane as a regular dessin into a Riemann

surface. A regular dessin is one possesing the highest possible symmetry in a surface,

and Singerman's embedding proved particularly interesting, since it linked together

three well known and widely studied objects: the Fano plane, Klein's quartic and

their automorphism groups which are isomorphic to PSL{2,7).           Furthermore it

is possible to describe the bits of that embedding by means of the cusp set of

the action of r(7) on the upper half plane, where r(7) stands for the principal

congruence subgroup of level seven of the modular group.


    All objects highlighted in Singerman's embedding are exceptional on their own

rights. Klein's quartic, among other interesting properties, is the Hurwitz surface

with the smallest genus (a Hurwitz surface is one that attains Hurwitz's upper

                                         iii
 bound for the number of automorphisms of a surface, which is 84(p — 1) for ^ > 2)

 and therefore it is a highly symmetric surface. The Fano plane is the smallest

 hnite projective plane, and arises as the projective space over the held Z2, while

 f5'Z,(2,7) enjoys a special status within the f5'Z,(2,p) family that is only shared

 by f 5'Z,(2,5) and f 5'i,(2,11) as it was proven in a result due to Evariste Galois.


      What we have done is to fully explore what we considered to be the parallel case

 to the Fano plane embedding described by D. Singerman, Ending some intriguing

 and beautiful relationships on our way. Since Singerman's embedding fully covers

 f6'Z,(2,7), we have been guided by the idea of exploring the remaining case in

 Galois' result, which is f5'i,(2,11), Ending objects that relate to each other in a

similar way to those involved with f6'jL(2,7). As a starting point for our work,

I have to acknowledge a very inspirational paper by Konstant: T/ie prap/i 0/ (Ae

 truncated /cogo/iedroM amcf (Ae                0/ GaZow' (see [Ko]).


     Starting then with f 5 ' i , ( 2 , l l ) we chose the 3-biplane aa the best candidate

for a structure to embed for several reasons. The hrst one is because it is a hnite

geometry with automorphism group isomorphic to PSL{2,11),               which is a necessary

condition and that is fairly similar to the Fano plane. Both of them, the Fano

plane and the 3-biplane are the smallest examples of Hadamard designs, and the

symmetric arrangement of the 55 Sags structure of the 3-biplane into 11 blocks of

5 Sags closely resembles the 21 Sags, 7 blocks of 3 Sags of the Fano plane. On the

other hand, there is a clear relationship between the flags set of the 3-biplane and

the vertices of a truncated icosahedron (which is basically the relationship between

f 5'i^(2,11) and its subgroups isomorphic to /Ig = f ^i,(2, 5)), and that relationship

mirrors that of the Fano plane and the truncated cube (which is again that between

f5'i^(2,7) and its ^'4 subgroups).


    In spite of Snding examples of 3-biplane conformal embeddings as a regular

                                           iv
 dessin, we thought it more appropriate to drop some hypothesis in the embedding in

 order to And examples with the rich structure underlying Singerman's embedding.

 Our main example is therefore no longer a dessin, since the components of the

complement of the embedded graph in the surface are not simply connected. This

is highlighted by the fact that we do not use a triangle group, but a Puchsian group

with three periods and signature (1, + , [5,5,11]).


      When we explore this example we realized that       emerges in a natural way

to play a role similar to that of       in the Fano plane case, further enhancing

the singular nature of these two embeddings, since        and      stand in a class

of their own within       as the only two Hecke groups with a cusp set equal to

Q(Ag) U {c)o}. As a last idea, we use the action of ^^^(4 — \/5) to describe the Aags

of the embedding, and the vertex set of the truncated icosahedron that relates to

it.
                           Chapter One

             R i e m a n n Surfaces and Dessins

     In the first half of this chapter we introduce the concept of Riemann surface
 and provide some preliminary dehnitions and results. For a broader introduction
 to Riemann surfaces see either [Mir] or [JS2]. The notion of compact Riemann
surface will be explored following two diS'erent but closely related approaches:
     - as 2-manifolds with an analytic structure,
     - as the quotient by the action of a cocompact Fuchsian group.

     Issues related to Fuchsian and NEC groups have also been discussed within
the first part of the chapter.

     In the second half we have examined the general properties of dessins and their
conformal embeddings into Riemann surfaces.

     A more general approach to the subject by substituting Riemann surfaces with
Klein surfaces has been outlined, and references to the topic of dessins embedding
in Klein surfaces are provided.

     1.1. Riemann surfaces

    Roughly, a                      is a space which, locally, looks like an open set in
the complex plane. To make the concept of "looks like" a bit more mathematical,
we need to define a c/iorf on a topological space %.

    A c/iaff on a two dimensional topological space % is a homeomorphism

                                            —> v;

where (7^ C % is an open set in %, and       C C is an open set in the complex plane.
The open subset ZTi is called the           of the chart     We say that the chart
 is cenfrecf at p E (Ti if        = 0, and it is easy to see that all a chart does is to give
 local complex coordinates in its domain.

        As the charts are local homeomorphisms, they can be inverted, and we will call

                             :=   o              n [/,) ^           H [/,)

 the              /wnctzoM between       and     . Two charts are               compa(%6/e if
 the transition function between both of them is analytic or if the intersection of their
 domains is empty. A set of charts             : C/i —> %} on A" is called an
 (also called a compZez           on % if         is an open cover of % and all the charts
 in the set are compatible. We will call the charts in an analytic atlas
                c/iorfs (or compZei

       It is easy to de6ne an equivalence relation within the atlases of X , two atlases
vl and jB are                 if every chart of one is compatible with every chart of the
other, and an equivalence class of analytic atlases is called a comp/ea; a(ruc(wre (or
                        on the surface

       Definition 1.1.1. A second countable, connected, Hausdorff topological space
with a complex structure is called a

       Although the previous dehnition allows non-compact surfaces, throughout this
work we will usually mean a "compact Riemann surface" every time we refer to a
Riemann surface.

       We can induce local orientations around each point of a Riemann surface by
"pull-back" of the orientation of the complex plane via a local chart. These local
orientations are well defined, independent of the choice of chart in the atlas and
they induce a global orientation on the Riemann surface so that the concept of
"clockwise" and "anticlockwise" rotation around a point in a Riemann surface is
well defined.

       Given two Riemann surfaces % and Y with complex atlases $ and                we can
define analytic mappings between % and Y in terms of their charts.

       D e f i n i t i o n 1.1.2, Let X and Y be Riemann surfaces with complex atlases
$ =                ^     and ^                    V}} respectively. We say that the map
/ : % —> y is                at p E % if there exist analytic charts               % with
p E       and                ^ with / ( p ) E [/j such that 1/;^ o / o       is an analytic
function at      (p).
      A map will be analytic in X if and only if it is analytic at every point of X . By
 deGnition, if a map is analytic at p, it is analytic in a neighbourhood of p. Using
 similar principles, we can define meromorphic and analytic functions on Riemann
 surfaces.

      It is easy to see that the complex plane C admits a complex structure and so
 is a Riemann surface (although not a compact one). By means of the stereographic
 projection, the one point compactiScation of C, E = CU{oo} also forms a Riemann
 surface which is called the Azemann 5^/iere. Analytic and meromorphic functions
 on a Riemann surface % (in the traditional sense of complex analysis) can be
 thought of as being analytic mappings from % to C and 2 respectively in the sense
 of Riemann surfaces.


      If a Riemann surface locally looks like an open set in the complex plane, there is
a more general object, that we will cover for the sake of completeness called a jiT/em
auT/oce, for a thorough introduction to Klein surfaces see [AG]. A Klein surface
has the property of being locally like an open set in the closed upper half-plane,


                                  = {a + 6* : a, 6 E R and 6 > 0}.


with the subspace topology that            inherits from the usual topology on C.
      Since there are two different classes of open sets in the upper half plane: those
that intersect its boundary, and those that are contained in the interior of the upper
half plane, we need to dehne transition functions that cope with this characteristic.

      We will say that a complex function / is antianalytic          (or anticonformat)    if
d j jdz ~ 0, and / will be called dianalytic if it is either analytic or antianalytic in
each connected component of its domain. It is easy to see that a function that is
both analytic and antianalytic in the same coimected component of the domain, is
constant on that component. We can generalize the concept of analytic chart to
that of                     on       a homeomorphism                  where Ui is an open
subset of % and        is an open subset of either C or    . If   is centred at p 6 % and
Vi is an open set of       but not of C, we will say that p is in the               of % (we
use       to refer to the boundary of %). Two charts will be                    compofzbJe
if their transition functions are dianalytic, and a set of charts        : [7^ —>      on X
is called a                      on X if     is an open cover of % and all the transition
functions are dianalytic.
         Two dianalytic atlases A and B will be dianalytically equivalent if A U B is
 a dianalytic atlas (that is, if every chart of one is dianalytically compatible with
 every chart of the other), and an equivalence class of dianalytic atlases on vY is a
                         on

         D e f i n i t i o n 1.1.3. A 2-manifold X with a dianalytic structure A on X will be
 called a           sur/ace.

         According to the previous definition, any Riemann surface is in fact a Klein
 surface, since any analytic atlaa is dianalytic, and any open set of C is homeomorphic
 to an open set in (C+. To avoid confusion, we will reserve the term "Klein surface"
 to its traditional meaning, that is, any surface % with a dianalytic structure that is
not orientable or has at least one boundary component, and we will use "Riemann
surface" to refer to Klein surfaces that are orientable and have no boundary. In
general, Klein surfaces will be assumed to be compact. As we have already stated
we will mainly study symmetric Riemann surfaces throughout this work.


         Let / : X ^ y be an analytic map defined at p which is not constant, then
(see [Mir]) there is a unique integer m > 1 such that there are local analytic charts
     and       centred at p and / ( p ) respectively, such that     o/ o                 We
will call m the                   of / at p. The multiplicity of a map at one point is
independent of the choice of charts, and by taking an element 1/ G Y we can dehne
the decree of / at 1/ ag the sum of the multiplicities of / at the points of % mapping
to ?/:


                                 4(/) =      ^


      The degree of / at 1/ is constant, independent of 1/, and so we will just call it
the degree of / .

      Given an analytic function / : % — Y of degree n, there is a hnite set of points
C ( / ) C y so that |/"^(3/)| = M for any ?/ E y — C ( / ) and 1 < |/^^(i/)| < M for every
?/ E C ( / ) , / is then an                        6rancAe(f if C ( / ) ^ 0 and
otherwise. The elements of C ( / ) are called the             nafttea or               of / ,
the elements a; 6 % with multiplicity greater than one are called the
or                        of / , and those with multiplicity one are called

     1.2. Fuchsian groups and N E C groups

     In this section we will introduce the main features of discrete groups of plane
isometries, regarding as a plane 7^ one of the following spaces:
     # The hyperbolic plane ZV with automorphism group

                  At(t(ZY) = f G'i:(2, R)           Ai/t+(&Y) = f ^i;(2, R)


     # The sphere E, with automorphism group

                               f Gi,(2, C)          v4iz(+(E) = f Gi:(2, C)


      The Euclidean plane C with automorphism group

                  v4%i((C) = A / / ( 1 , C )        A?it+(C) = A / / ( 1 , C ) .

                                                5
     Where the bar above the groups means that we extend their natural action
 using complex conjugation.

     In this work we will make the standard abuse of notation and use matrices

 and for a 6eld ^ we will call

     The reason for giving a special consideration to these three Riemann surfaces,
will become clear after the following well known theorems:

     T h e U n i f o r m i s a t i o n T h e o r e m 1.2.1.              Every simply connected Riemann
surface is conformally equivalent to the hyperbolic plane ZY, the sphere E or the
Euclidean plane C.

     The above theorem is due to F. Klein, H. Poincare and P. Koebe, for a proof
using modern notation see [Bea2]. A proof of the theorem below is easily obtained
from results in [JS2] §4.19 and §5.7.

    T h e o r e m 1.2.2. Let A be a compact Riemann surface, then there is a discrete
subgroup       of                    (where % is either &/, E or C), acting on %                     without
Exed points, such that ^ is isomorphic to the quotient space

    Given a group G of plane isometries, we will say that it is Mon                                       if
it contains any orientation reversing isometries (if it contains reflections or glide
rejections), otherwise G is an one»(a6Ze                                   The set of all the orientation
preserving isometries of a given non orientable group G is itself a subgroup of G of
index two, and we will usually refer to it as G+. A discrete subgroup of f6'i^(2,R)
is called a fbc/isma                     and a discrete subgroup of A2it+('P) with a compact
quotient space (a cocompact group) is a                                             group. CrystaDographic
groups may have torsion.

                                                          6
           We can classi^ the elements of                    (and therefore the elements of any
 Fuchsian group) by the number of hxed points in ZY, this classihcation can be done
 in terms of the trace of the matrices.

          We will say that an element M =                    ^ f6'Z,(2,R) is

      -           if the action of M Exes two conjugate points in C, one of them is in ZY.
          We have that t r ( M ) — |a +     < 2.
      -             if the action of M fixes only one point o n E u { o o } , |a + d| = 2.

      -              if M 6xes two points in R U {00}, we get that |a + (f| > 2.

          It is worth thinking of elliptic elements as Enite order rotations about a point
in the open upper-half plane, while parabolic elements can be seen as inhnite order
rotations about a point in R U {00} and hyperbolic elements as translations in the
closed upper-half plane.

          Any hxed point by a parabolic element of a Puchsian group G is called a cusp
(or                pom(), and the set of all cusps by elements of G is called the cusp set
of G. The number of orbits of the action of G in its cusp set is called the
c/oss TZMmter of G.

          A point a 6 R U {00} is a                of a Fuchsian group F if there is a a; E ZY
and a sequence ^ = ^1, ^2, - -,            - - with      6 F such that the sequence

                              ^(a;) = ^yi(a;), ^2(2;),...,          ...

converges to a. The set of all hmits points of F is Z'(F), the                 set of F. Every
point a fixed by a parabolic or hyperbolic element of F is a limit point of F. If we
call 0 ( F ) = R — L(r) the ordinary set of F, we will say that the Fuchsian group F
is of the          Amcf if 0 ( F ) is empty, otherwise we will say that F is of the secoMcf
           If F is of the second kind, then I,(F) is nowhere dense in R. We will only deal
with first kind Fuchsian groups.

          By the uniformisation theorem, we know that for each Riemann surface
there is a set of torsion free crystallographic groups                = {0^} that uniformize
   these groups are called stfyyace                of    and it can be proved that           is a
class of conjugate groups in At((+(P) so that A is isomorphic to                if and only if
      A                  repmn for a crystallographic group G is a closed, connected
 subset ^ of 7^ such that:
      - for every point a; E 'P there is a point ^ 6 f such that a; E G?/.
      • No two points in the interior of F are in the same G orbit.
      - F is locally hnite, that is, any compact set C C "P intersects only hnitely
 many images of
      It is easy to see that if JZ is uniformized by G, and F is a fundamental region
for G, then (see for example [JS2] Th. 5.9.6.):

                                            %
                                             G       G'
      A                           is a special type of fundamental region whose boundary
is a union of geodesic segments that we call the                    of the polygon. Given any
fundamental polygon f and g a side of f then there is precisely one side of f that
we call g and one element p E G so that ^(g) — s (it is possible that g = g) and
p ( f ) is adjacent to f along g. We say that g and g are pozred by
     Fundamental polygons are very useful to And presentations for subgroups of
Puchsian groups by means of a technique known aa Reidemeister-Schreier's method.
It can be proved [Bea] that given f a fundamental polygon for the Puchsian group
r , the side pairings elements of f generate F, so we can associate to the fundamental
polygon f a set of generators for F

                                     $ = { A , ,^2, . . . ,/3n}

consisting of side pairings elements of f .

     Suppose that we have a subgroup A < F and we call                      a whole set of right
coset representatives for A in F so that

                                         r =    |_J Ac,
                                               c&CR
( U denotes disjoint union), we say that G ^ is a                   5'cAre%er (ronauergo/ for A
in F if whenever ciCg . . .      is a word in $ with cic2 . . .         E G;% then we have that
C1C2 • • . Cn—\ E Cji'
     Once we have a Schreier transversal for A in F, we can describe a set of
generators for A.     For any element ^ E F there is a unique r E G^ such that
A r = Ap and we call g = r. Then the set

                              B = {r^(r/3)"^ | r E                G$}
 generates A and is called a set of 5'c/ire%er                         for A in P.

     With a set of Schreier generators and transversals, we can find a presentation
 for A in P. We assume that F has presentation < % |                      > and we call

                               ^ = {crc"^ |c E               r G


 If we write the elements of ^ in terms of those in ^ and call this new set                    a
 presentation for A is given by < B |             >.

     E x a m p l e 1.2.3. We will calculate a set of Schreier generators for the Puchsian
group A = (1; [3,3,7]) inside F = [3,4,7] where T has presentation


                     < A, B, C I                          = ABC = 1 > .

     We have that $ — {A, C'} is a set of generators for F while

                               Cj% = { l , A , C , C \ . . . , C G }

constitutes a Schreier transversal for A in F, and we get the following diagram (see
Theorem 1.2.5. and Example 1.2.6.)

                  AC^     AA       AC       AC^        ACG                  A        AC^

for the action of A and C on the right cosets of A.

    We can now easily calculate the set of Schreier generators, if we delete obvious
repetitions, like elements inverses, we get:

       B

and we have that A has presentation < B |                 >, where A are the relations of F.
In order to get a standard presentation for A we might have to consider changing
the generators in B by some of its conjugates in A, that has been done in the last
section of chapter four, where this particular pair of groups have been considered.
       The following result shows how to construct a fundamental polygon for A < F.

       T h e o r e m 1.2.4. Let A < F be a pair of finitely generated Fuchsian groups
 such that r has fundamental polygon f and Cj; is a right Schreier transversal for
 A in r . Then a fundamental polygon for A is

                                       f' =    IJ r f
                                              rEAc

 and the sides of f    are paired by the Schreier generators corresponding to Ac-

       Let now ^ — 7^/(7 for some G E              then if we call   the normaliser of
G in             we have that (see Theorem 5.9.4. in [JS2]):


                                  Aut+(R)      =

and furthermore, any group of orientation preserving automorphisms of JZ is iso-
morphic to            for some group                    so that

     As we have mentioned before, the group of automorphisms of P contains orien-
tation reversing elements as well, so we may consider what happens when we allow
orientation reversing elements in the previous theory. Although there is no generic
name for a discrete subgroup of A'u(('P) with orientation reversing elements, we will
be mainly concerned with crystallographic groups, and in this case we use
as an acronym for Non Euclidean Crystallographic, referring to cocompact discrete
subgroups of

     We will follow with groups terminology the same rules already stated for sur-
faces, and therefore we will call crystaliographic groups those NEC groups that
contain no orientation reversing element, reserving the name proper JVEC ^roup (or
just NEC group) for those which do. If G is an NEC group, its coTioMzcaZ
               is G"*". Since the set of Riemann surfaces arising from the action of
Euclidean and spherical groups is very limited in scope (for instance, no surface of
genus g > 2 is formed in such a way), we may sometimes use the word "Fuchsian"
in a general way to refer to a group that contains no orientation reversing elements,
although it may not be a hyperbohc group.




                                              10
        A Riemann surface R admits an antianalytic involution if the normaliser of
 G E         ill            contains orientation reversing elements. If this is the case, we
 have that:

                                                                G
        It is obvious that 7V+(G) =                        (where we define Ar+(G) := ]V(G)+), and
 that               = ]V(G) if and only if              is not symmetric.

        A special class of crystallographic groups are triangle groups. A (proper
                      is deSned as the group of isometries generated by the rejections on
the side of a triangle with angles y, ^ and ^ and is represented by r ( / , m , M),
which we will usually shorten to ((,m, n) if no confussion arises. We will say that
a triangle group is gp/ierzca/, Euc/Weon or                                 if y + ^   ^ is greater than,
equal to or smaller than 7r.

        The canonical Puchsian group of a triangle group, is also called a triangle
group, and in that case the group is deEned as the group generated by rotations of
order M, m and Z at the vertices of a triangle of angles y, ^ and                           In general it
will be easy to know from the context if we are talking about orientation preserving
or reversing groups, and we will use r [ / , m , a] to denote a Fuchsian triangle group
and                a) to denote a proper NEC triangle group.

        It is clear that:
                                           r + (Z, m,     = r[Z, m, n].


        The importance of triangle groups will become apparent in the next section, due
to its relationship to the Belyi functions (see [JS3] and [Sch]) and the fundamental
groups of maps and hypermaps. We can dehne a triangle group using only algebraic
terms as the group with the following presentation:

           r ( / , m, n) = < 27, ?/, z I       — 2/^ =        = (3:3/)' =          = (za;)" — 1 >


                        r[/, m, n] = < a, 6, c I                 = c" — a6c = 1 >


      Macbeath and Wilkie proved that for each crystallographic (or NEC) group
G with compact quotient space there is a signature and a "marked polygon" from
which a canonical presentation for G may be derived, a marA;e(f                                 being a
fundamental polygon for G together with the identifications on the boundary of

                                                         11
 F produced by the action of G. See [Wil], [Mac]; the explanation here has been
 taken from [Wat]. The presentation for G is given by:

     < Xi, Cjj^, Cjy (ip,bq I Xj ' = Cjf^ = {cjk—icjk) •''' = CjoejCjtjBj = AD = 1 >

      Where yl = xi-..XrCi...fig, i = l...r,              j =          k = 0...tj,       p=l...g,    q = l...h
with r > 0, J > 0,            > 0, p > 0,           E {0,^?},           >2,             > 2 and:

      -D =                                    ^             if   = ^.

      • D = a\...a^g                                        if h ^ g.

      The numbers            are called the proper penodg of the group, while the Mjt's
are the ZmA; penodg, and will correspond to the branch points lying inside the
quotient space or in its boundary respectively. The quotient space § has genus p
and is orientable if A = p and non orientable otherwise. The number of boundary
components of the quotient space is g. If s = 0 and there are no proper periods, G
is a crystallographic surface group, while if g                  0 and there are no proper or link
periods, then G is an NEC surface group.

     Periods       (or           can be inhnity, in which case the relations of the form
     = 1 (or                   = 1)          omitted from the presentation. Any hnite order
element of G is either conjugate to                   or to (c^k-iCjk)-^ (for a certain                 A;,/),
therefore if G is a Fuchsian group, all its hnite order elements are conjugate to its
elliptic generators.

     To every presentation (and therefore to every group) we can associate a signa-
ture which will be

in the non-orientable. When r = 3, s = 0 and p = 0 we have the Puchsian triangle
group r[??zi, 7712, tTis], while if r = 0, ff = 0, s = 1 and ti = 3, we get the NEC
triangle group that we have called r ( n i i , 7112,^13)-

      Singerman [Si3] determined the hyperbolic area of a fundamental region of a
 NEC group G. In the orientable case it is:




                                            $=1                   j = l A;=l

have any boundary components (s = 0) and therefore no link periods is usually

     We will end the present section with a Theorem by David Singerman [Sil]
concerning subgroups of Fuchsian groups with hnite index. Although the original
theorem is more general, we wiH only use it for cocompact Fuchsian groups. This
theorem allows us to work out the signature of the subgroup, given the signature
of the big group and the actions of its generators on the cosets of the subgroup. A
generalization of it for NEC groups was done by Hoare [Ho].

    phism 8 : G — j ? so that the permutations 8(3:1) has cycles of length              and
    precisely pi other cycles whose lengths are m i / a i i , . . .

 1.2.3. and consider the map 8 : G — g i v e n by:

                                    (1)(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

     If we call 8 ( G ) = ^ it is immediate that we are mapping G onto a transitive
 subgroup of 6"^. 8(^4) has two cycles of length 3 that produce no other periods
 in f and two cycles of length 1 that produce two 3 periods in F . 8 ( B ) produce
 no period of F since all its cycles have length 4, on the other hand 8 ( C ) induces
 a 7 period in F since it has got one cycle of length 1. We have seen that f has
signature (p; [3,3,7]) and the condition //(F) = 8//((7) implies that p = 1.

     1.3. Maps

     In this section we want to explore the relationship between maps and hyper-
maps. We will define maps and hypermaps over Riemann surfaces and explain
the geometric and algebraic approach to these objects. A current term, due to
Grothendieck, to refer to both maps and hypermaps is "dessin d'enfants" or just
deagm. For an introduction to maps theory see [JSl], for a discussion of the wide
scope of dessin theory see [Sch].

     Intuitively, a map is a decomposition of a surface into polygonal two-cells
or faces. That leaves a structure on the surface composed by the interior of the
polygons (faces), edges and vertices that constitute the map, for an easy example
of these we can think of the platonic solids as maps on the surface of the sphere,
picture              below depicts the map on the sphere induced by a tetrahedron.

    The set of vertices and edges of the map constitute a graph which is embedded
into the surface. Although we will allow a very general class of graph, we will
require the graph to be connected and that to every vertex there is only a Enite
number of incident edges, this number is the           of the vertex. Our graph can
contain edges with one or two vertices, the edges with two vertices correspond to
our everyday perception of an edge, as for the edges with only one vertex, they can
either be a Zoop or a /ree ecfpe, the difference being that a loop is homeomorphic
to a circle, while a free edge is homeomorphic to a segment. Every face would
be surrounded by a finite number of edges, and this number is the valency of the

                                         14
 face, faces should be simply-connected. An oZZoiuecf             is a graph satisfying the
 previous conditions. For a picture of a generic map on a sphere see Fip.             6^

     A Aypergrop/i is a generalization of this idea where we allow any Enite number
of vertices to lie on an edge. We will meet some hypergraphs when we describe
Enite geometries in chapter three.       Our only restriction on the structure of the
hypergraph is that it is connected, and that to every vertex there is only a Enite
number of incident edges. We can dehne a                       Momorp/iigm as a bijection
/ between the vertex sets of two (hyper) graphs that induces a bijection between
the edges set so that the incidence structure is preserved, that is, if

                                             I(P) e f{E)

where P is any vertex contained in the edge E.

     We will start with the topological approach to a map, then describe the al-
gebraic structure of it, and use algebraic notions to generalize the concept of map
to that of a hypermap. Nevertheless, after the topological and the algebraic ap-
proaches have been explained, we will need to provide maps with a richer structure,
namely the analytic structure of their underlying Riemann surface.

    D e f i n i t i o n 1.3.1. A map Ai on a compact surface X is an embedding of an
allowed graph Q into X such that the components of X — Q are simply-connected.
We call the components of % — ^ the /acea of Ai.

    D e f i n i t i o n 1.3.2. A topological map Top{M)   is a triple {Q,V,S)   where G is
an allowed graph, V its set of vertices and 5" is the underlying surface.



                                            15
     D e f i n i t i o n 1.3.3. Let e be an edge of a map M. with endpoints ei and eg
 (that are identified in the case of loops), and let m be a point in e which is not ei
 nor 62- We can now divide e into two segments mi and 7712. A             of a map Ai
 is a pair consisting of a vertex and an incident segment. If there are no free edges
then every edge has two darts.

     In           we can see the three different kinds of edges on a map with their
corresponding darts.




                               Z/Oop,               edpe ond yree e(f^e


     We can associate an algebraic structure to the topological construction de-
scribed above. We will first consider the map M. with its set of darts that we will
call 0 + , the superscript + means that we are working with maps on orientable
structures, since we are only interested in Riemann surfaces, we will not cover the
definition of maps for Klein surfaces, for a survey of that topic see [BS] and [IS].
We define two permutations of [2+ as follows:
     - ro consists of cycles formed by going round each vertex in an anticlockwise
direction.
     • r i is the product of the transpositions that interchange the two darts on an
edge or loop, and fix the dart on a free edge.
    The product r2 =           consist of cycles which define anticlockwise rotations
of the darts about each face of Ai. If we let G+ = < rg, r i > be the group generated
by ro and r i , G+ is a subgroup of 5"^^,the group of permutations on the elements
of Q+, that is transitive because the graph underlying Ai is connected. G_|_ is the
moMOcfromi/        of Ai, we could have called it the oriented monodromy group,
but as we have already stated, we will only consider maps on orientable surfaces.
We define the algebraic map of Ai to be:


                           (A/p A<)+ = ( G + , n + , r o , r i ) .

      E x a m p l e 1.3.4. The tetrahedron in Fig. 1.1.a) has 0 + = {n \ n = 1...12} as
 its set of darts, and the permutations are:
     ro        (1,2,3)(4,5,6)(7,8,9)(10,11,12)

     n         (1,9)(2,11)(3,6)(4,10)(5,7)(8,12)

     E x a m p l e 1.3.5. The map in Fig. 1.1.b) has 0 + = {n \ n = 1...15} as its set
 of darts. The permutations are:
     ro        (1,2,3,4,5)(6,7,8)(9,10,11,12)(13,14,15)

     n         (1,11)(2)(3)(4,15)(5,6)(7,14)(8,9)(10,13)(12)

     D e f i n i t i o n 1.3.6. We define an algebraic map as a quadruple:

                                                         := (G'+,^]+,ro,ri)

where          is a Suite set, (7+ is a transitive subgroup of the group of permutations
     generated by rg and r i , and where r i is a product of disjoint transpositions.
We call r2 =                    To any oriented algebraic map                                 there is a topological map
    so that AZ^+(Ai) =

     If ro and r2 have orders m and a respectively, we say that Ai (resp. yl"'") haa
     (m, Ti), that is, the Z.c.m. of the valencies of vertices and faces are m and M
respectively.

     Given the triangle group T[m, 2,n] with a presentation of the form:


                             r[m, 2, n] =< a, b | a™' = b"^ =                                    =1 >
and a map Ai of type (m, n) with AZp"^(Ai) =                                                r2+,ro,ri), we can de6ne an
epimorphism 6 : T[m, 2, n] — s e n d i n g a to tq and 6 to r i .

    Let G+a — {p G G+lap = a } be the stabiliser of a E                                             then M =
is called a fundamental               group of M in T[m, 2,n]. A different choice of dart a will
yield a group conjugated to M in r [ m , 2, n], hence to every map Af of type (m, n),
we can associate a conjugacy class of fundamental groups in r[m, 2, n] (see [JSl]).

    Next, we identify (1+ with the set of right M-cosets in r[m, 2, n] by the bijection
MA —a!(/i^). Taking M* = jiL'er(^), the core of M (the intersection of all the
conjugates of M by elements of F), we can identify G+ with the quotient group

                                                                  17
 r[m, 2, M]/M* by M*p ^        so that the action of a (respectively 6) corresponds to
 the permutation ro (respec. r i ) in (7+. In this way we see that any finite index
 subgroup M < [m, 2 , i s a fundamental group of some oriented map.

      It is possible to generalize the concept of dart, so that we can define maps
 on Klein surfaces, this generalization relates in a natural way to the inclusion of
 crystallographic triangle groups into NEC triangle groups, see [BS].

     Another important property of a fundamental group M of a map Ai is that
 the surface 5" in which the map is embedded is uniformized (not uniquely) by M in
the sense that:


                                       ^=M-


     To every topological map corresponds an algebraic map, and from any algebraic
map we can recover a topological map. Unfortunately, this relationship does not
make both categories equivalent, since there are many ways of altering a topological
map via an homeomorphism of the underlying surface without a counterpart in the
side of algebraic maps.    We want to have a geometrical definition of map that
allows us to translate results from the algebraic category to the geometrical one,
and in order to do so, we need to define maps on surfaces in such a way that the
isomorphisms between them correspond to isomorphisms between their underlying
surfaces. These maps when considered on Riemann surfaces were originally called
           mopg by [JS], we will call them           maps, since their isomorphisms
correspond to mappings that preserve the analytic structure of their underlying
surfaces. The first step to define them is to define universal maps and quotients of
maps.

     The NEC triangle group r ( 2 , m , » ) acts naturally on 7^ and has a triangle T
of angles a = §, 6 = ^ and c = ^ as its fundamental polygon. If we draw a dart
on the side (z6, and let F act on ab with that dart, we get a map on 7^ with all the
edges of the same length and such that all vertices have order m and aU faces have
order m, this is the                     map      o/ (ype

    Let Ai = (^,V,5') be a topological map of type (m,n), then there is an
algebraic map ^ = yl/p(Ai) associated with it, from where we can calculate a
fundamental group M of M.. We have seen that M < (2,m, n) and therefore M
acts on the universal map Ai of type (m, n) sending vertices to vertices, edges

                                         18
 to edges and face centres to face centres. The quotient of this action is a map
 vM of type (m, zi) which is naturally embedded in the surface 5" by the covering
 TT : P          and which is topologically equivalent to Ai. Ai is an                  map of
 VW.

       Any analytic map, is in particular a topological map. We have proved that to
 any algebraic map        there is at least one topological map Ai so that .A =

       D e f i n i t i o n 1.3.7. Two maps M and M ' of type (m, n) embedded in the sur-
 faces 6" and 5" are called                             if there is an analytic isomorphism


 between the surfaces that takes the set of vertices, edges and faces of Ai to the set
of vertices, edges and faces of A i ' respectively.

       If we consider the dehnition of an algebraic map, there is no reason why we
should restrict ourselves to quadruples where r i has order two, and not consider
groups where this condition is dropped. In fact, this property corresponds to the
fact that the edges have only two vertices, so by allowing a higher order in r i , we will
study maps whose edges contain more than two vertices, and whose fundamental
group is a Snite index subgroup of the triangle group                     Those objects are
what we call              Ayjcermopa.

       1.4. H y p e r m a p s

       D e f i n i t i o n 1.4.1. An oriented algebraic hypermap A consists of a finite set of
objects 0 + that we will call the bits (or brins) of A, together with two permutations
ro,ri G         and a group G+ = < r o , r i > such that G+ is transitive in

       (As before we will drop the word "orientable" since we will only consider Rie-
mann surfaces). We call G+ the                       protip of the hypermap Vl. The cycles
ro and       correspond to                  and               in precisely the same way as
the cycles generating the monodromy group of a map corresponds to vertices and
edges, while the permutation rg = (rori)"^ corresponds to                        The hyper-
map is represented by the quadruple ((9_|_,f]+,ro,ri), and if n has order             we say
that ^ has         (/o,4,^2)' The           of     is equal to |r2+|.

    We extend the notion of fundamental group to hypermaps by considering the
natural epimorphism ^ : r[Zo, Zi, Zg] ^ G+ in the same way as we did with maps. We
therefore can deEne a                             of ./I to be M = ^"^(G+a)- We will use

                                              19
 the word o/^ebrozc (feagm to refer to either an oriented algebraic map or hypermap
 indistinctly.

       Although from the algebraic point of view there is little difference between a
 map and a hypermap, it is not intuitively immediate how to view a map on a surface
 when we allow each edge to meet as many vertices as necessary, several authors
 have suggested different ways of doing it, we wiU first give an abstract definition of
 topological hypermap on Riemann surfaces and then describe the representations
by CoTi, James and

       D e f i n i t i o n 1.4.2. A topological hypermap % on n. Riemann surface 5" is a
triple (5",      y ) where ^ and y are closed subsets of 5" such that:
  aj       := E ' n y is a non-empty finite set. 0 + is called the set of     (or
       ^ U y is connected.
       The components of E' and y are homeomorphic to closed discs. The compo-
       nents of E' are called           while the component of y are the
       The components of 5" — ( E ' u y ) are homeomorphic to open discs and are called
       /ig/peT/aces.
       We will call                    an object which is either a topological map or
hypermap on a Riemann or Klein surface.

       For an explanation of dessins on Klein surfaces see [IS].

       T h e Cori representation

       In the Cori representation (see [Co]) hyper vertices and hyper edges are rep-
resented by closed polygons called 0-faces and 1-faces respectively (we will colour
0-faces with a light grey and 1-faces with a dark grey), each polygon having as many
sides as the length of the cycle it represents, while hyperfaces are represented by
open polygons called 2-faces each one having twice as many sides as the order of the
hyperface they represent (2-faces are painted white). 0-faces are mutually disjoint,
as are 1-faces, and they intersect each other only in their vertices, which represent
the bits, each bit shared by precisely one hypervertex and one hyperedge. As the
hypermap is embedded in an orientable surface A, we can de&ne an anticlockwise
permutation of the bits around each 0-face and each 1-face consistent with the ori-
entation of       these permutations corresponds to ro and       respectively. If we call
y the set of aU O-faces, and ^ the set of aU 1-faces, then y U ^ is a closed set in
i?, and the components of R — {V U E) are the 2-faces, which are open polygons

                                           20
 that induce the permutation rg = (ror^^). As 2-faces have an even number of bits,
 ^2 permute the bits acting as the square of the clockwise permutation around each
 hyperface.

     The Cori representation is very easy to draw and shows some symmetries of
 the hypermap in a clear way, but has the drawback of differentiating between hy-
pervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces in a way that seems unnatural if we regard
the algebraic definition of the hypermap.

     The James representation

     The James representation (see [Ja]) displays the trinity among hypervertices,
hyperedges and hyperfaces in a more natural way. This time O-faces, l-faces and
2-faces will aU be polygons with twice as many sides as the orders of the elements
they represent. The intersection of any two i-faces is always empty, and O-faces
and l-faces intersect along one side. To place the bits, we need to consider the
three-valent map on ^ dehned by the sides of these polygons, in such a map every
vertex heis order three and each edge separates faces of diSFerent labels (there are
no two i-faces with a common edge). Going anticlockwise around each vertex, we
get a permutation of the faces that is either (0,1,2) or (0,2,1), if the permutation
is (0,1,2), the vertex is called a bit. Once the bits are placed, the permutations
ro, r i and rg follow in the same way as with the Cori representation.

     To go from the Cori representation to the James representation, we push to-
gether the hypervertices and hyperedges with a common bit, thereby changing the
bit in the Cori representation (one point) to an edge in the James representation
one of whose vertices is a bit, and doubling the number of sides of every 0-face and
1-face.

                                         21
        T h e Walsh representation

        In order to introduce this representation first presented in [Wal], we need to
 define a            mop, that is, a map in which the vertices have one of two colours,
 and such that aU edges connect vertices of different colours. Starting now at the
 Cori representation, we substitute every 0-face by a 0-vertex (where the number
of the vertex refers to its colour) and every 1-face by a 1-vertex, and we join two
vertices together if and only if their respective 0-face and 1-face intersect in a bit,
therefore substituting each bit shared by the 0-face and 1-face for an edge joining
the two new vertices. We have now a bipartite map on the surface, with the same
number of edges as the number of bits of the original hypermap, the vertices in the
bipartite map stand for the hypervertices and hyperedges, while the faces of the
bipartite map represents the hyperfaces of the original hypermap. The permutation
ro (resp. r i ) corresponds to anticlockwise rotation around each 0-vertex (resp. 1-
vertex) while r2 corresponds to the clockwise permutation of the edges around a
face.

    E x a m p l e 1.4.3. The hypermap 'He has 0 + = {n \ n                  1...12} as its set of
bits, and the permutations are:
    ro      (1,2)(3,12,10,6)(4,5,7)(8,9,11)

    r2-4(l,8,ll)(2,10,6)(3,5,9)(4,12,7)

    We have already defined the cycles ro, r i and 7-2 =                  ^ for the hypermap
when we explained the Cori model. If we let G+ : = < r o , r i >, (?+ is a transitive
subgroup of 5"^^, and we define the or%en(e(f oZgebrmc                        of   to be:
                             XZ^+(?/) = ( G + , n + , r o , r i ) .

                                              22
      We say that the hypermap has (g/joe (Z,m, n) if ro, r i and r2 have orders Z, m
 and n respectively.
      It is clear that if any element of the set (Z, m, n} is 2, then the quadruple will
 be an algebraic map up to duality. We will use the name                 cfeaam to refer
 to either algebraic maps or algebraic hypermaps.

     We can embed % into the surface:

                                               U


which is a Riemann surface since M is a subgroup of a crystallographic triangle
group.

     To define an analytic structure on hypermaps, we follow a similar procedure
to the one explained in the case of maps. We Erst define the wnzweraaJ               of
type (/,m, n) by using a triangle with angles 7r// (labelled 0), yr/m (labelled 1) and
7r/n (labelled 2). By the action of r(Z,m, n) on that triangle, we get a map over
7^ with three diSerent types of vertices, if we delete the vertices of type 2 and the
edges meeting these vertices, and paint with white the vertices of type 0 and with
black those of type 1, we get a Walsh representation of the uniferaof Ai/permap of
type (/, m, yi) which we shall call 'K(/, m, n) or simply % when no confusion arises.

     If   = (6",   y ) is a topological hypermap of type (Z, /M, 7%), we can calculate
its algebraic hypermap and its fundamental group H < r ( / , m , n). Letting H act
on "K, we get a quotient hypermap H/H          embedded into V/H^ and we call it the
dianalytic hypermap corresponding to ?/. If ^ contains no orientation reversing
elements, by using the Fuchsian triangle group r[l, m, n] for the orientable universal
           we get an analytic hypermap corresponding to

    D e f i n i t i o n 1.4.4. Two hypermaps 1-1 and H' of type            embedded in
the surfaces ^ and 5" are                           if there is an analytic isomorphism
between the surfaces that sends the set of hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces
of "K to their corresponding sets in

    1.5. Group of Automorphisms of a dessin

    Since we have dehned maps and hypermaps as particular cases of dessins, I will
dehne morphisms in the category of dessins, and the natural restrictions of these
morphisms can be translated in an easy way to either maps or hypermaps. We will

                                          23
 use the name vertices, edges and faces of a dessin to refer to either vertices, edges
 and faces of a map, or hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces of a hypermap.
 Whenever no distinction is needed, I will use "bits" to refer to darts and bits.

         Results in this section are well known in dessin theory, and most of them have
 been reworded from [JSl]. When they are more general than the original result,
 the proof still follows along the same lines.

         D e f i n i t i o n 1.5.1. We will say that 0 is a topological morphism between the
 dessins D and D' with topological structures given by (5", jF, y ) and
 if      : 5" —> 5" is a topological covering between the underlying surfaces (possibly
 ramihed, all branch points having hnite order), preserving orientation and so that
 <^(^) =          and <^(y) = r .
        We say that D                  D' if there is a morphism from D to D'.

        T h e o r e m 1.5.2. Let D and D' be dessins of type (Z,             n), then %) covers D' if
and only if there are groups M and M ' which are representatives of the conjugacy
classes of fundamental groups of D and D' respectively, such that M < M ' .

        D e f i n i t i o n 1.5.3. Given two dessins V and V embedded respectively in S
and          we will say that         : D —>       is an           morpAzam between the dessins if
      is a topological morphism between the dessins and an analytic morphism between
the underlying surfaces.

        This definition of morphism between dessins is more restrictive than the one
originally suggested in [JSl], since we impose the condition that the morphism
preserves the analytic structure of the surface. It corresponds to the "Riemann
morphism" between maps described in that paper.

        D e f i n i t i o n 1.5.4.   We will say that the pair of functions i/j = ( f , g ) is an
a/pebrozc mofpAwm between the dessins D and D' with algebraic structures given
by (G, Q, ro, r i ) and by ( C ,           rg, r^) respectively, if / :     > r]' is an onto function
and p : G ^              is a group epimorphism such that p(ro) = fg, p(ri) =               and the
following diagram commutes:

                                          XG                   ^    0
                                      /        9                        f
                                       ri' X G'                ^    f]'

that is, f{ar) = f{a)g{r),           for any r G G acting on any a G O.

                                                      24
      We will say that xp = {f,g) as in Definition 1.5.4. is an algebraic isomorphism
 between the dessina %) and D' with algebraic structure as above if / : fZ —>           is a
 bijective map and p : G — C is a group isomorphism.

      Two topological dessins D and          are               if there exists a topological
 morphism ^ between them, such that         is a homeomorphism between the underlying
 surfaces, therefore the group of topological automorphisms of a dessin is too ample
 for our purposes, on the other hand, the group of analytic automorphisms of a dessin
 is hnite, and in fact is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the underlying
surface. The analytic definition of isomorphism introduces some rigidity in the
structure of topological dessin that is needed if we want to define a one to one
correspondence between algebraic and geometric structures.

      D e f i n i t i o n 1.5.5. Two dessins D and %)' are                          or just
            if there is an analytic isomorphism between them.

     P r o p o s i t i o n 1.5.6. Any dessin V which is equivalent to an analytic dessin
D' is an analytic dessin itself.

     C o r o l l a r y 1.5.7. The following results are equivalent for dessins embedded
in Riemann surfaces:
     - The analytic dessins %) and D ' are isomorphic.
     - The algebraic dessins AZp(D) and                  are isomorphic.
     - The oriented algebraic dessins               and             are isomorphic.

     We can now define the class V of all the analytic dessins isomorphic to V and
the class A of all the algebraic dessins isomorphic to A.

     T h e o r e m 1.5.8. For any class A there is only one class V such that, given
V e V, Alg{T>) G A. And for any class V there is only one class A so that the
analytic dessins associated with the algebraic dessins in .A are all contained in D.

     C o r o l l a r y 1.5.9. Analytic dessins with morphisms and algebraic dessins with
morphisms are two equivalent categories.

     Therefore, we can define the functors         and       that induce mutually inverse
bijections between the isomorphism classes of oriented algebraic and analytic dessins
of finite type.
     T h e o r e m 1.5.10. Let Dy and D2 be subgroups of r[/o, /i, h] of finite index so
that they are fundamental groups of some dessins, then, they give rise to isomorphic
analytic dessins if and only if they are conjugate in r[/o,       h]-

                                            25
     T h e o r e m 1.5.11. If D has fundamental group D < T(lo,h,l2),   then the full
group of automorphisms of V is:




where                is the normahzer of D in r(foXi,^2)- Now we can assume that
the dessin can be embedded in a Riemaim surface, in which case, the group of
orientation preserving automorphisms of D is:




    We will say that a dessin is         if its group of automorphisms acts transi-
tively on the set of bits. Regular dessins corresponds to dessins with the greatest
degree of symmetry. If we relax the transitivity condition, and request only that
all the vertices have the same valency, all the edges have the same valency, and all
the faces have the same valency, we get unz/orm dessins. Every regular dessin is
uniform, but the converse is false.

                             Chapter Two

                PSL(2,p)           and Hecke groups

     This chapter is divided into two main parts. The Arst one (2.A.) studies the
structure of the family of Snite groups jP^Z,(2,p) where p E Z is prime, focusing
in particular in the cases where p E {5,7,11}. These cases are covered in three
separate sections.

    In the second part (2.B.) we will introduce jif" (for n > 3), the family of Hecke
groups of the hrst kind. Two separate sections have been used to describe the main
properties of        which is the modular group, and

    While the Hecke groups         and     are important for our work because they
provide us with a tool for the arithmetic characterization of the two main combi-
natorial structures embeddings described in chapter four, (Singerman's embedding
of the Fano plane, and the 3-biplane embedding into           we are also interested
in PSL{2,7)     and PSL{2,11),   because they are isomorphic to the automorphism
groups of the Fano plane and the 3-biplane respectively.




                                         27
                  2.A. The structure of f
      Let us call 5'2(2,p) :=                     where p is a prime and p > 2, i.e. the set of all
 2 x 2 matrices with coefBcients in the held Zp such that the determinant is equal to
 1. f5'i^(2,p) is SZ,(2,p) modulo its center, that is, modulo (7, - 7 ) where 7 is the
 identity matrix.

     P r o p o s i t i o n 2 . A . I . PSL{2,p)     where p > 3 prime, is a non-commutative
 finite group of order
                                           p ( p - l)(p + 1)
                                                    2

     P r o o f That PSL{2,p)         where p > 3 prime is non-commutative is easily seen
 by considering for example matrices


                               " = (o 1)                             J
in f 5'Z,(2,p) and checking that             ^ 6a.
     To calculate its order we will count all matrices

   - a;?/ ^ 0: There are f — 1 choices for a; and p — 1 choices for ?/, we can then
     choose ( in p ways and for each choice of a;, i/, ( there is only one possible choice
     for z. That yields           — 1)^ elements of this form.
   - a;?/ — 0: If we aasume a; = 0 then there are p choices for ( and p — 1 choices
     for y. Once x, y, t are fixed there is only one possible value for z. If y = 0 the
     same reasoning applies and so there are 2p{p — 1) matrices of this form.

     We have proved that \SL{2,p)\ = p{p — l)(p + 1) and the order of PSL{2,p)
follows naturally from the fact that \PSL(2,p}\              = [SL(2,p) : (±/)].      •

    It is well known that every group PSL{2,p)                 acts transitively on a set of p + 1
elements, and we will prove it geometrically in the following lines. In order to
see this action geometrically, we call Pp the projective line defined over the field
Zp. Every element in Pp = { 0 , l , . . . , p — l , o o } can be represented by a pair of
homogeneous coordinates [r : s] (where r, 5 E Zp), so that [r : g] stands for:

                                      oo                  if s = 0
                                            (mod p)       if 5 ^ 0

where ^ = rs

                                                    28
      As we have already mentioned in chapter 1, we will be using the standard
 abuse of notation whereby elements of f 5'Z,(2,p) are thought of as matrices, and
 we will associate to every element M G f                  a bijection of Pp dehned in the
 usual way:




 where as usual /M(oo) =             if c ^ 0 (mod p) and /M(oo) = co if c = 0 (mod p).

      It is easy to see that the image of z by /M does not depend on the choice of
 homogeneous coordinates for z. As /M is a bijection in the finite set Pp, we can
 treat it as a hnite permutation and End its representation as a product of disjoint
 cycles. That this action is transitive is easy to see since


                       a=    Q      J)   . i=         J ) eP5'L(2,p)


and the action of o on the points of Pp is a cyclic permutation of the finite points
 (i.e. those which admit coordinates [r : 1], r E Zp) while the action of 6 swaps oo
and 0.

     P r o p o s i t i o n 2.A.2. PSL(2,p)   acts doubly transitively on Pp.

     P r o o f If we consider the ordered pair (a, b) E Pp with a ^ b (mod p) and
oo 0 {o, 6}, we see that the matrix


                                                     e-PSi(2.p)


takes the ordered pair (0, oo) to (a, 6). If oo E {a, 6}, we need to consider two cases
separately:
     - If 6 = oo we take         = 1 and        = 0, and then        sends (0, oo) to (o, 6).
      If o = oo then we can take




     and the action is doubly transitive.

     However, the action of f 5'Z,(2,p) on Pp is not triply transitive in general, as
we can see with {0,1, oo} and ( 0 , 1 , 3 } for p — 7.

                                                29
      P r o p o s i t i o n 2.A.3. Given p,q e Z prime numbers so that p = I (mod q),
 there is only one non commutative group G of order |G| = pq that we shall call
 Gpg. The structure of Gp, is given by

                    Cp X Cg = < / , e I / P =                         = 1>


 where w G Z* and              — g. Therefore the structure of the semidirect product
 is independent of the choice of it.

     P r o o f As p is prime there is a subgroup Cp of order p in G, and by Sylow's
 theorem the number TV of these subgroups satisfy

                        TV = 1    (mod p)             and         N | q.


Therefore TV = 1 and using Sylow's theorem again Cp < G and the structure of G is
given by:
                           < /, 6 I                            = 1>

where it G Zp.
     - Assume that or(Z2.(w) ^ g, then either it = 1 or               ^ 1 (mod p). If it = 1
it is easy to see that G is commutative and therefore of no interest to us. On the
other hand, if i/^ ^ 1 ( m o d p ) , using                  = 1 we get               and by
making s — g we get / =               By elementary group theory (u^ — 1) = 0 (mod p),
which is a contradiction.
     • Once we have proved that ordz* (u) = q, all that remains is to prove that for
different it, the corresponding groups are isomorphic. To do so we choose a new
generator           (where s ^ 0 (mod g)) so that we can rewrite the last identity
in the presentation of G as                    = 1. As g is prime ordz.(it^) = g and it^
runs through all order g elements in Z* therefore making it possible to derive any
other presentation from the one in proposition 2.A.3.

    N o t e If g is not prime, the result is not true, as we can see with the following
non-commutative and non isomorphic groups of order 20:
                        G = < A, / I         = /^ =          V = 1>
                       G' = < A, / I       = /^ =                = 1>

    In general, given p = 1 (mod          , the number of non-isomorphic groups of the
form Cp X Cn is d{n), that is, the number of divisors of n.

                                              30
      C o r o l l a r y 2.A,4. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and q another prime so that
 p = 1 (mod g). There are only two groups of order pg:

      - The cyclic group that we shall call Cpg.

      - The semidirect product Cp x Cg = Gpg and is presented as in the previous
 proposition. This group haa one normal subgroup of order p that we shall call
     = < / >, and p subgroups of order g, that are conjugate by the action of the
 elements of Cp.

      P r o o f Let us call ^ any group so that |jif| — pg where p and g are as in
 the hypothesis. If ^ is non commutative, we are in the hypothesis of the previous
 proposition and we have finished. That Cp < H is unique and normal is true by
 Sylow's theorem. If the order g subgroups were not conjugate by / , then one of
them should be normal in Tif (since         for a certain s will belong to its normalizer)
which contradicts Sylow's theorem.
     If ^ is commutative it must be the direct product of a Q, and a Cg, and
therefore, we have

     P r o p o s i t i o n 2.A.5. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and n = 2 ^ . If we consider
the action of f 5'i^(2,p) on     where a; G Pp. We get that              = Cp x      with
presentation:



where    G Z* and         (w) = M.

     P r o o f Since the action of f 6'i^(2,p) on Pp is transitive, we can choose a; = oo
without loss of generality, and we see that


                        |^W(oo)| =



     In fact, 5'(o6(oo) consists of any element of the form ^ ^      % j where a, 6 G Zp
and o ^ 0. If we call
                                   1                /o    1
                                   0   1/           \0    ^
                                                          O
where ordz.(a) = 2^ — p — 1, we have that o r d ( / ) = p and or(f(e) = n =
therefore e and / generate 5'(a6(oo). We can see that                      and then the
result is proved.

                                            31
     L e m m a 2.A.6. Let p be a prime p > 3, m G Z a positive integer so that p = I
 (mod m). The following two subgroups of GL{2,p) have order pm:


                                         | o , b e Z p , a"^ = l ( m o d p ) j


                                         I o, 6 G Zp, (1^ = 1 (mod p ) ^
                       - j (0 1
          hag presentation

                       < /i, / I /i": = /P =                    = 1>

while a presentation for "Mpm is given by

                        < /i, / I       = yp =                 = 1>

where a G Z* and ordz* (s) = m and (r, m) = 1.
      If m is odd we have that
      If m is even the two groups are non isomorphic.

     P r o o f An easy process of counting elements shows that the order of both
groups is pm, and using Sylow's theorems we get that the group structure is Cp xCm,
furthermore the groups are non commutative.

     Once we have identif ed the structure of both groups, all we need to do is choose
suitable generators / and     of order p and m respectively and study the action of
h on f . A choice for Qpm is / =          j^,A= ^^           i ^ where ordz* (a) = m. It is
immediate to check that hfh'~^f~"'       = 1 and the other possibilities arise when one
substitute h with    where (s, m) = 1.
                                                                             0\
    A choice of generators for           is / as before and             ^    ^ I, bearing this
in mind, the rest of the proof is as above.
    If m is odd we can dehne the isomorphism                        ^        by

                                    a   6\             6a
                                    0   u " I 0         1
                                        O
    By working with the presentationa, it is easy to see that no isomorphism be-
tween the groups can be defined in the case where m is even.

                                            32
      P r o p o s i t i o n 2. A . 7 . Let p, g G Z be primes, p > 5 and q > 2 so that p = 1
 (mod g), and let Gpg be as in Corollary 2.A.4. There are only two groups ^ up to
 isomorphism so that         < ^7 and [jif : Gpg] = 2. The two possibilities for ^              Eire

 either :
                       H = Q2pq — Gpq X C2               or       H = ?^2pg-

     P r o o f As [jif : Gpg] = 2, we have that Gpg <              so in order to describe ^ we
 need to Snd all possible order two automorphisms (% : Gpg — G p g . Taking Gpg
presented as in Proposition 2.A.3., and using the information from Corollary 2.A.4.
we get that o" must satisfy:

                                                    o'(e) =

where a, s 6 Zp and 6 E Zg.
     - As        = / we have that o = ± 1 (mod p).
     - As (7 has to preserve the relations of Gpg, from

                    1 = (7(e/e-Y"")            we get          eVe"'' =

but in particular we know that                                and since a ^ 0 (mod p), we have
      = 1 (mod p) and so 6 = 1 (mod g).
      If o = 1 (mod p), from cr^(e) = e we obtain a = 0 since otherwise Gpg should
be commutative.

     We have proved that either cr is equal to the identity c i : Gpg — G p g or is a
representative of the following family of order two automorphisms:


                            0-2 ( / ) = /c-l    0-2 (e) = / ' ' e / -

where g E Zp.

    Since there is at least one element of order two in                 — Gpg, we can call it g and
assume that it induces the automorphism of Gpg, i.e. <7i(a;) —                       for % E {1,2}
and z E Gpg.

    In the case of cri it is easy to see that p commutes with the generators of Gpg
and therefore we obtain jif ^ Gpg x C2 and from there

                                         H = G2pq-

                                               33
       For the action of erg, we need to prove that the same group H is generated
 regardless of the choice of a G Zp. We can see that the equations relating the three
 generators of ^ are:


                1) e / e ' V " == 1      2)         = 1        3)           = 1.

      We can choose to change the generator e for E' —                    where n E Zp. If we
 do so we get the following expressions
            1) E / E - =      1       2) p / p / = 1      3)                       = 1.

      As K ^ 1 and Zp is a field, if we let n = ^ we can easily show that any choice
of g yields the same group structure as s = 0.                      O


      Given a group G, we will say that the subgroups F, Tif < G are
if given any element p E (3 we can express it in a unique way as a product p = / / t
where / E f and A E          If that is the case, we will write G = F        .ff. It should be
noticed that two subgroups F, ^ < G are complementary if and only if G = F j f
and     n     = {!}.

      A very interesting point about f5'Z,(2,p) goes back to Galois, who proved the
following result:
      T h e o r e m 2.A.8. For p > 11, there is no subgroup of PSL{2,p)               which is
complementary to any of its p-subgroups.

      That means that for p > 11 we cannot get jP5'Z^(2,p) =                  Zp, which im-
plies that there is no transitive action on p points for PSL{2,p)            if p > 11. This
can be seen in the following way: as p is a factor of \PSL(2,p)\              and p^ is not
(see Proposition 2.A.I.), if there is a transitive action of PSL{2,p)              on p points
{a;i,... ,a;p}, no order p element of f5'i^(2,p) can fix any {a;^} (otherwise p^ will
divide |f5'i^(2,p)|), which means that given g E f5'Z,(2,p) of order p, we have that
f ^Z,(2,p) = 5'(a6(a;i) < p > for any z E { 1 , . . . ,p}.

      For the cases where p < 11 and f 5'i,(2,p) simple, that is, for p = 5, 7,11, we
know that the following holds:
    f;9i:(2,5) = A4-C5            f^i,(2,7) = & . C 7               fgI,(2,ll) = A5.Cii
and therefore PSL{2,p)      acts transitively on p points. Through this work we will
try to explore this special feature geometrically, especially for the cases where p = 7
and p = 11.

                                               34
     2.1. The structure of f 5'j}(2,5)

     We will not go into too much length for the case p = 5, but for the sake
of completeness, we will explain two ways of seeing its geometrical action on five
points, f 5'Z,(2,5) is isomorphic to A5, the alternating group on Ave elements that
is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of an icosahedron.

     L e m m a 2.1.1. Ag is a simple group and it contains:
   - No proper subgroup of order higher than 12.
   - 6 conjugate subgroups of order 5.
   - 10 conjugate subgroups of order 3.
   - 5 conjugate subgroups of order 12, each one isomorphic to A4.

     This is not a full description of ail the subgroups of Ag and it merely describes
those subgroups order that are interesting for our work. For each conjugacy class,
we can End Eve diSierent embeddings of A4 into Ag, and its algebraic action on
Sve points is readily seen as its action on these embeddings by conjugation. Our
geometrical examples will mirror this action.

   - Given an icosahedron, we can see its face centres as the vertices of hve tetra-
    hedra inscribed in it. The symmetry group of the icosahedron permutes the
    inscribed tetrahedra transitively.
   • For another view of the same phenomenon, we can consider the set of edges
    of the icosahedron and form pairs of antipodal edges. Thus we obtain fifteen
    pairs of edges so that each pair defines a rectangle inscribed in the icosahedron.
    The fifteen rectangles form triples of mutually orthogonal elements, and the
    action of PSL(2,5)   will permute transitively the five triples.

    It is eaay to see how these two examples relate to the algebraic action explained
above, since the symmetry group of both the tetrahedron and a triple of mutually
orthogonal rectangles is isomorphic to A4.




                                         35
          2.2. T h e s t r u c t u r e of PSL{2,7)

          We will represent f         7) as the group generated by the following matrices


                  " = ( - 1     I)'   ''=(?        ? ) •          ' = ( 0   1

  where                   = abc = 7. This group has order 168 and appears as the group
 of automorphisms of two important classical geometric objects: the Fano plane,
 which will be covered together with other examples of finite geometries in the next
 chapter, and Klein's quartic, that will be described in chapter four.

         L e m m a 2.2.1. [Kll] PSL{2,7)      is a simple group of order 168 that contains:
        - No proper subgroup of order higher than 24.
        ' (2) ^     subgroups of order 3 in one conjugacy class.
        - 21 subgroups isomorphic to C4 in one conjugacy class.
        - 8 subgroups of order 7 in one conjugacy class.
        - 8 subgroups of order 21 in one conjugacy class.
        - 7 X 2 = 14 subgroups with 24 elements in two conjugacy classes. All of them
         are isomorphic to 5'4.

         L e m m a 2.2.2. If we consider the action of PSL{2, 7) on P7 we see that:
         1- There is a one-one correspondence between the C3 subgroups of f5'Z,(2,7)
and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P? given by the fixed point set of the action of
each C3 subgroup on IP7.
         If a C3 subgroup corresponds to {a, b}, we will refer to it as
         2- There is a one-one correspondence between the C? subgroups of f5'iL(2,7)
and the points of Py given by the Sxed point of the action of each Cy subgroup on
P 7 .




         If a C7 subgroup corresponds to o E P7, we wiU refer to it as C7
         3- Each subgroup of order 21 is isomorphic to C7 x C3. There is a one-one
correspondence between the subgroups of order 21 and the stabilisers of elements
in P7.
        If a group of order 21 is the stabiliser of o E P7 we will refer to it as G21.




                                              36
     Proof

     1- We can take any order three element and calculate its cycle structure on P?,
for example:

               0        —1
                             G f 5'iy(2,7) produces (0 6 oo) (1 3 5) (2) (4)
                1        1

and we see that it fixes {2} and {4}.            Given that all order three elements are
conjugate, they all have the same cycle structure and therefore every C3 fixes two
points in Py. Since f 5'Z,(2,7) acts transitively on pairs of points of Fy, the proof is
finished.

     2- For the case of Cy we can do the same, if we start with z —> z + 1, it only
fixes 00. Since the group action is transitive on Py, the rest follows.

     3- From Proposition 2.A.5. we know t h a t for any a G P?

                                    Stabi^a) = Cj X C3.

    Since there are only eight subgroups of order 21, each one is the stabiliser of a
point.              O

        We will consider the geometric actions of PSL{2, 7) on seven points in chapter
 four. Before we do that, we need to highlight the fact that the symmetric group on
 four elements       contains four subgroups of order three. We have already seen that
 we can characterize all C3 in f           7) by their pair of Exed points (i.e. refer to
        as (a, 6}), and we will label all subgroups of order 24 in f 5'Z,(2, 7) using this
characterization, that is, we will refer to each of them by the four pairs of points
that characterize its order three subgroups. That information is displayed in the
previous table and will be used in the next two chapters, the 14 embeddings of ^'4
have been separated into two conjugacy classes that we shall call class f and claas
i,. (see Example 2.3.3. in the following section).

        2.3. The s t r u c t u r e of P5X(2,11)

        We can represent the group jP5'i,(2,11) in many different ways that are related
to triangle Fuchsian groups. We can see it as the group generated by the matrices
(or any other conjugation of this triple):


               "=(?      V)'       ''=(-1 s)'                  '=(01
where                     — abc = I.     This representation is useful when we study
epimorphisms from Fuchsian groups with three periods of type [2,5,11]. On the
other hand we can see it as the group generated by the matrices:


              "=(1      ~o')'     ''=(1      /)•              °=(o      ?

where a? =              = abc = I, and we will use these matrices for groups of type
[2,3,11]. There are other ways of presenting this group that we will cover in chapter
four.

    f 5'i^(2,11) has order 660 and beside being the biggest group of the family of
f 6'Z^(2,p) that acts transitively on p points, it is the automorphism group of the
3-biplane, as we shall prove in chapter three.

    L e m m a 2.3.1. [Di] PSL{2,11)       is a simple group of order 660 and contains:
  - No proper subgroup of order higher than 60.
  - ( ^ ) = 66 subgroups of order 6ve in one conjugacy class.
  - 12 subgroups of order eleven in one conjugacy class.

                                            38
    - 12 subgroups of order 55 in one conjugacy class.
    - 2 X 11 = 22 subgroups of order 60 in two conjugacy classes. All of them are
     isomorphic to Ag.
     This list is not complete, there are some other subgroups of               11) that
 are not mentioned here, however, it is complete for every order that is mentioned
 in the lemma.

     L e m m a 2.3.2. If we consider the action of PSL(2,11)      on P n we see that:
   - There is a one-one correspondence between the C5 subgroups of f 5 ' Z , ( 2 , l l )
     and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P n given by the Axed point set of the
     action of each C5 subgroup on P n .
     If a C5 subgroup corresponds to {o, 6}, we will refer to it as
   - There is a one-one correspondence between the C n subgroups of f6'Z,(2,11)
     and the points of P n given by the hxed point of the action of each C n subgroup
     on Pii.
     If a Cii subgroup corresponds to a E P n , we will refer to it aa
   - Each subgroup of order 55 is isomorphic to C n x C5. There is a one-one cor-
     respondence between the subgroups of order 55 and the stabilisers of elements
     in P7.
     If a group of order 55 is the stabiliser of a E P? we will refer to it as Ggg.

     The proof for the above lemma is similar to the proof for the corresponding
one in the case p — 7 (Lemma 2.2.2.) so we will omit it here.

    The geometric actions of PSL{2,11)      on eleven points will be covered in chapter
4, and as we have done before we need to explain a way of classifying the embeddings .
of Ag into f 5'iL(2,11). We have seen that there are six possible embeddings of C5
into v45, and that each C5 < f 5 ' Z , ( 2 , l l ) can be labelled with its pair of hxed
points on P i i . Following the same idea as in f 6'i^(2,7), we wiU characterize every
^ 5 < f 5'i^(2,11) by a sextuple of pairs of points as it is shown in the table below.

     E x a m p l e 2.3.3. Let us consider the subgroup G of PSL{2,11)              generated by
the matrices:
                                  9    0\           ,  /9        10
                           a      6    5            '=  0

If we consider the action of a on P i i we see t h a t it corresponds to the permutation
                           (1,00,7,10,9) ( 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 4 ) (0) (8)
on the other hand, 6 corresponds to
                           ( 1 , 6 , 4 , 7 , 8 ) (2,10,9,5,0) (3) (oo).
     We can label < a > =             — {0,8} and < 6 > =                 = {3,cx3} and see that
G = Ag. Studying the action of           on the set of pairs of points of P n , we see that
the pairs hxed by a and 6 belong to the same orbit, which is the sextuple of pairs
t h a t characterizes G:

                     I {1,2} {5,7} {8,0} {6,10} {4,9} {3,oo} }.

And therefore those are the six subgroups isomorphic to C5 contained in G.

                     2.B. The Hecke group

      In general, a Hecke group          is a discrete subgroup of f5'Z,(2,R) that is
 generated by the following two transformations:


                          % : z —> —        and      Z : z —> z + A
                                    z
     In a result due to Hecke [He], any group generated by % and Z as before is
 discrete if and only if A > 2 or A =        = 2 cos      where M E N and M > 3. The
 Hecke groups where A > 2, are Fuchsian groups of the second kind, with a limit set
 that is nowhere dense in R, and they are of no interest to us. The case A = 2 gives
a Puchsian group of the hrst kind but with a non compact quotient, as for the case
A = An they are Fuchsian groups of the 6rst kind, and we will refer to them as
Every time we mention "Hecke group" in this work, we shall mean Hecke group of
the Erst kind. In particular, we see that




and for a > 4 the inclusion is strict.
     In this work we will deal with        which is the modular group F = f             Z),
and the group       where Ag is the golden ratio.

                                            i + Vs


     When considered in terms of their presentation, the groups iiZ"" are triangle
groups with signature [2, n, oo], where X is a representative for the elliptic elements
of order 2, Z is a parabohc element and


                            y =            :z -
                                                     Z — Ar
is a representative for the elliptic elements of order M, thus there is one conjugate
class of subgroups of order n.

    We can find a fundamental domain for             which will be a hyperbolic triangle
in ZY with one or two of its vertices in        = R = R U {oo}. A standard choice for
a fundamental region of       is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices 0,           and oo;
another choice is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices —       a     n   d   oo.

                                           41
     In general, the description of the elements of -ff" cannot be explicitly done,
 however it is possible to describe them for the cases M = 3, 4 and 6. We will cover
 M = 3 in a later section while the other two cases are very similar to one another:

                                  n = 4   we have   A4 — \/2
                                  n = 6   we have   Ag = \/3.

     We will now prove that a matrix M is an element of Tif"* where         = 2(A; + 1)

     It is easy to see that any matrix in jf"'' must have this form. Any matrix in
     is represented by a word in % and Z, and any word in % and Z with only one
% would be of the form

                            K   „ = Z-ATZ' =                    1


for a certain r, g E Z. We will prove that all words with an odd number of X in
them have the form of the matrix Mo while the words with an even number of %
have the form of Mg. We will proceed by induction and first assume that the result
is true for any word W) with Z or less % in it.

     Take a word PK/+1 with Z + 1 appearances of %, we can express it as              =
    g-^Wi for certain r, s G Z and for a certain word Wi with I appearances of X.
By hypothesis, if Z is odd then




where a, 6, c,       E Z and an easy calculation shows that         corresponds to a
matrix of the form Mg. If / is even we choose W) from the set of matrices of Mg
and proceed in the same way.

    As for the set of cusps, it is not known what the cusp set is for a general
although we know that the cusp set of f 5'_L(2, Z[An]) is Q(An) U {00} (which we
represent by Q(An)) and thus that of jif" must be a subset of Q(An). One of the

                                               42
 best results for this problem is due to Leutbecher [Leu2] who proved that for the
 values M 6 {3,4,5,6,8,10,12} the cusp set of               is:

                                                  U {oo}.

       Therefore in the case n = 3, the cusp set is Q while for the case n = 5 its
 cusp set is Q(\/5), and in both ceises the cusp set is the whole held completed
 with infinity. It turns out that these are the only two cases where the equahty
                — Q(An) holds, since Wolfart [Wol] proved that it is false for any other
 case except perhaps M = 9 and Seybold proved later that n = 9 is not possible either
 [Ro].

       The field Q(An) is a number held, that is, it is a hnite extension of Q, and
its degree is         where     is the Euler function. In fact it is the maximum real
subheld of the number held Q(e2n), where             is the nth root of unity, and we can
easily calculate its degree since            : Q(An)] = 2. The ring of algebraic integers
of the held Q(An) is Z[An] (see [Was]), that means that if a; 6 Q(An) is a solution
for
                                + dra-l'-jC^ ^ + • • • + do = 0

where a, E Z, then z 6 Z[An]. And furthermore, given ?/ E Z[An] and d =
then ^ have the form

                                       d— 1 I L    \ d— 2

where 6; G Z.

      If we are to study the structure of the ideals of Z[An], it suffices to study
its prime ideals, since Z[Xn] is the integral ring of a number field, it is a Unique
Factorization Domain (UFD). We cam go even further, since for           < 68 every Z[An]
is a PID (see [Was]) and every ideal in it is principal. Since we wiH only deal with
M = 3 and n = 5 that result covers our two chosen cases.

      Given f a prime ideal of Z[An] (where n < 68) we will say that j V o r m ( f ) = m
if m G Z is the smallest positive rational integer so that P | m. There is a general
definition of the         of an ideal where the class number is diferent from 1, but
we will not need it here.

      Our last concern is going to be the group of units of the rings Z[An], but in this
case we will only cover the cases we are going to use. For n = 3,5 the integers rings

                                            43
 are Z and Z l-}-\/5
                2
                     respectively, while the group of units in the rings is {1, —1}
 for the case n = 3, and is the cyclic group generated by                               for the case n = 5.

        A standard feature of any Hecke group is that its cusp set can be represented
by finite continued fractions.

      N o t a t i o n We will use the notation                       to indicate a term inside a contin-
ued fractions expansion, and we will display the terms in a continued fractions
expansion ordered, between brackets and separated by commas to make clear the
non-commutative nature of this representation, so that

         Since Jif" is a free product of its generators, we can impose conditions on

as well consider the continued fraction representation for every cusp unique [Ro].

      Another interesting area for the study of Hecke groups are their subgroups, in
particular the special congruence subgroups. Given the group P5L(2,Z[A„]) and I
an ideal in Z[An], we can define the apeciaf con^n/ence                       of
for I as:



f           Z[A»]) (7) = j ^ g   ^ ^ ^ f ^i:(2, Z[A»]) | o = ( f = l , 6 = c = 0 (mod 7)



    f^i:(2,Z[A»])i(/) =                e f ^ i , ( 2 , Z [ A » ] ) | a = (f = l, c = 0 (mod 7)



          f^7:(2,Z[An])o(7) = j ( c            ^ f^7:(2,Z[A»]) | c = 0 (mod 7)


                                             45
     We call PS'L(2, Z[A„])(/) the principal congruence subgroup of P5L(2,Z[A„])
 for / . We can extend these deGnitions to Tif" and deEne the special congruence
 subgroups of 77" as:




where the subscript * can be 0, 1 or omitted.

     We will proceed to describe some relations satished by the special congruence
subgroups of f6'i}(2,Z[An]). That the principal congruence subgroup satisfy

                            f        Z[A»])(7) < f ^i,(2, Z[A^])i(7)

is easy to see if we take the group epimorphism


           T/,:P5'I,(2,Z[A^])i(7)—dehnedby


where [6] denotes the class of 6 inside                 and calculate

     The previous result is actually a particular caae of a more general one since
f6'i}(2,Z[An])(Z) is actually normal inside the group f5'i,(2,Z[An]) for which we
need to consider

   « :                          P S L (2,               given by 4- (   ^            ^    ^ )


where [x] is the class of a; in         , it is clear that PSL{2,'L[\n]){I)       = Ker{^).     We
have as well that
                        f          Z[A»])i(7) < f            Z[A»])o(Z).

    This we can see if we consider the epimorphism


      %:fg^(2,Z[A^])o(7)—^


where [a] is the class of a in                       and [/(Z[An]//) is the set of units of
Z[An]/7. We can check that jirer(%) = f5'i,(2,Z[An])i(/). It follows in a natural
way that the same happens to the special congruence subgroups of

                    (7) <       (7) 0       (7) < 77"      and    7f" (7) < 77"

       As for the indices of the special congruence subgroups of             for a given n, in
 general they are not known. The indices of the subgroups of f5'Z,(2,Z[An]) (see
 [Hur]) provide an upper bound, but there are examples where these bounds are
 not attained.

         [ f 5'i:(2, Z[A,]) : f gz:(2, Z[A,])om] =                                   j

where               stands for the norm of the ideal 7, and f runs through the distinct
prime divisors of 7.

       There are many cases where the indices of the special congruence subgroups
of 77", attain the upper bound provided by the indices of the special congruence
subgroups of f 5'7,(2, Z[An]), as it is shown in the following theorem by Prye [Pr]

       T h e o r e m 2.B.4. Let

     We will take for gi anted the first equality, which is widely known, and use it to
prove the other two. In order to do so we will use the functions ^ and % defined in
section 2.B. in the context of the special congruence subgroups of f5'i,(2,Z[An]).
When n, = 3, r = f 5'iL(2,            so we can use % to prove that

where y; is the Euler function. On the other hand, if we use                        we can prove that

    For any integer A^ of Z we will say that the congruence subgroups of F for #
are of level N.   We know that F(A^) has no elliptic elements if AT > 2 so that if
we fill in the cusps of X =          we get in X the structure of a compact Riemann
surface

    Another interesting result, which follows inomediately from the discussion of
special congruence subgroups of f5'i^(2,Z[An]) in section 2.B. is:

    T h e o r e m 2.4.3. If p G Z is prime, we get that:

 cusp set of r . In fact for any W [Schoe]:

      T h e o r e m 2.4.4. Given two cusps of F, ^ and ^ if they are expressed as

     The next interesting Hecke group is n = 5 and that for a number of different
reasons. It is together with M e {3,4,6} the only other cajse where               is a
quadratic extension of Q, and together with M = 3 the only case where the cusp set
is the completed field Q(An). Unfortunately we do not have any explicit description
of the matrices of      , although we can by-pass this problem by the use of continued
fractions.

      Once we have described the cusp set of                   it is natural to try to answer similar
 questions to those solved for n = 3, like finding the index of the special congruence
 subgroups of 77^ or the action of the principal congruence subgroup for the ideal
 7, ^ ^ ( 7 ) over the cusp set of              The following explicit calculation of the index

                                 p+ 1   in any other case.

where p is the positive rational prime contained in 7.

     We will prove a theorem for the action of 77^(7) on the cusp set of 77^ that
is similar to the one explained for n = 3. Before doing so we need to define the
canonical form of a cusp of 77^.

     Let ^ E 0 ( ^ 5 ) be a cusp of 77^, we can find a unique expression of ^ as a
continued fraction of As of the form:

                     n                  -1               -1                            -1

where 0 ^ 6 % . We will define a reduction process in order to construct the canonical
form of J . Given a finite continued fraction of the form

it is clear that the following expression represents the same number and is one step
smaller:
                            bo                                 bn—l^n

where for technical reasons we will not allow any form of fraction simplification
within the last term of the expression.

    If we apply this process to the continued fractions expansion of ^ in terms
of A5 aa defined in Theorem 2.5.1., what we get is a fraction (that should not be
reduced) whose numerator f and denominator Q Eire an expression in Oi and A5.

      We say that         J is the canonical form of the fraction ^ under A5. It is clear

 that there is a Z G Z such that f                              and Q = Agm so that ^                                  The main
 advantage of using the canonical form of a fraction is that it allows us to find a
matrix M E          that takes it to either 0 or 00. [Ro]

                         Finite Geometries

     The aim of this chapter is to introduce incidence structures, that will lead
to (hnite) geometries and designs.        Among them we will pay special regard to
projective planes and biplanes, particularly to the structure of the Fano plane and
that of the first three biplanes, paying special attention to the biplane of order three
or 3-biplane.

     Among other connections that will be explored in the next chapter, the Fano
plane and the 3-biplane are the Srst two examples of Hadamard designs. Most of
the information displayed here can be found in [HP] and [Po], as well as proofs
for most of the results in this chapter, unless otherwise stated.

     3.1. Introduction

     An                      or simply a               is a pair of non-empty sets 7^
and £, which we shall call points set V and lines set C with an incidence relation
Is c V x jC consisting of a non-empty set of pairs (P, I) where P is a point and I a
line. We will assume that the structures have a finite number of points and lines,
that is, that they are      structures.

    If (P, Z) E ig, we say that P belongs to Z, that P and / are               or that
(P, I) is an incidence pair. The usual name for lines in structures is blocks, but we
prefer lines since we will rapidly move into geometries.

    We can represent the incidence relation Is of a finite structure S with m points
and n lines by a m x n matrix Ms that we call an incidence matrix of <S.




                                           55
     To construct an incidence matrix of S we need to index the points and lines
sets 7^ =             /I =              and de6ne Mg eis the matrix with coeScients
where i = 1,... ,m, j = 1,... ,n and:

                                                    1

                                                0        otherwise.
            is not uniquely determined, but it contains all the relevant information
about the structure (S. In fact, given Mg and                            two incidence matrices for the
same structure       there are two permutation matrices (i.e. matrices so that in every
row and column all the coefficients are 0 except for one that is 1) A and 5" so that:

                                            RMsS             = Mg.


    We will say that a finite structure                      is             if for any two points f and
Q there is a sequence of incidence pairs of the form

                [ ( p , o , ( P i . o . {-Pi.(i),                 ( P 2 . h ) , . . . . w.;')]

that connects f and Q.

    With the previous definition of structure there are some pathological cases that
we want to avoid:

  - Two lines (resp. points) are                             if they are incident with the same set of
    points (resp. lines), if we remove all repetitions (i.e. we get rid of aU repeated
    elements of one kind but one), we say that we have recfucecf the structure. It is
    clear that reducing the structure is equivalent to eliminating all repeated rows
    and columns in the incidence matrix.
  - We say that an element (point or line) is                                when it is in none or just
    one pair of the incidence relation, and we say it is full when it is incident with
    all the elements of the other type. We                                     a structure if we remove
    all isolated and full elements. On the other hand, we standardize an incidence
    matrix when we remove all columns or rows that have either all coeScients
   equal to zero, all coefficients but one equal to zero, or no coefEcients at all
   equal to zero.

   A structure is                            if it is reduced and standardized, we wiU caU
            a connected totally reduced structure.                    This dehnition of geometry is

                                                        56
 more restrictive than the usual one (that allows full and repeated elements) but we
 are not interested in the anomalous cases. Although in the process of reducing or
 standarizing a given structure <$ we might convert normal elements into repeated,
 isolated or full elements and therefore will have to remove these elements as well,
 the process is essentially well defined. Since the structures we Eire considering are
 hnite, their total reduction is either the empty set or a geometry that we will call
 Qs-

       In a reduced structure we can consider any line / as a subset of "P, so that f
 is incident with Z if f E Z. We will say that a structure is                 if all the lines
contain the same number of points and                  if all the points are incident with
the same number of lines, we will say that a uniform structure with A; points in
every line is (nmaZ if every set of A; points is incident with at least one line. A
            is one with a hnite number of points.

       We dehne the /Zogs (also called 6/(5 because they play a similar role to that of
bits in dessins) of a hnite geometry as an incidence pair, so that every pair ( f , Z) in
the incidence relation corresponds to a Aag.

       Given two structures .9 and 7", an                between them is a bijective map
from the point set of (S to the point set of 7" that induces a bijective map between
the line sets so that the incidence relations are preserved. An                        is an
isomorphism of a structure into itself. These dehnitions extend in a straightforward
way to finite geometries.

       Since an incidence matrix contains all relevant information about a structure,
we can characterize isomorphic structures in terma of then: incidence matrices: two
structures S and T are isomorphic if and only if there are incidence matrices Ms
of     and M-r of 7", and two permutation matrices         5" such that:


                                             = M-y-.


       From the definition of geometry and the dual nature of repeated, full and

if we swap points for lines in a geometry ^ we get its         geometry,        The use of
the superscript ^ describe the fact that the incidence matrix of           is the transpose
matrix of Mg.

         We can consider as well the set of complements of the lines of a geometry ^
 as a new set of lines, if V with this new set of lines is a geometry, we will call the
 resulting incidence structure the                                       of

        E x a m p l e 3.1.2. Let S be the geometry with points V = {Pi, P2, Ps,                           lines
 ^ = {^1,^2,^3,^}, and incidence relation given by:

                              Z 2 - { f l , f 3 , a } Z3 = { P l , P 2 , f 4 } Z4 = { f 2 , f 3 , f 4 }

        We will call      its complement structure, whose incidence relation is trivially
given by:
                         i'i = { P i ] = {P2} 13 = {P3] 4 = { f i } .

        If we totally reduce         we end up with an empty incidence structure (since
every point belongs to a single line) therefore making it impossible to get the com-
plement geometry of

        N o t e We could easily avoid the problem showed in Example 3.1.2. by changing
the definition of "full element" to include any element that is incident with all or all
but one of the elements of the other kind. The complement of a geometry deEned
in that way will be already a totally reduced structure, and therefore a geometry.
We have not done so because with that definition we would have excluded some
structures commonly regarded as geometries, aa <$ in the example above.

      Proof $ E              is defined by a pair of bijections ((^,        where

                             (j) : V —> V        and     (f)' : L —^ £

so that (f,Z) E                             e        It is now easy to see that

     For the proof of the second part, we will consider            as a subset of f oi(;er(7^),
the set of subsets of 7^ and dehne /Zj as the set

                               zic = {z I z = P _ r , r E r } .

For a given element $ E                 eis the de6nition of                        is consistent
with the pointwise extension oi (j) : V —> V, we can define ip : Cq —>- Cq by
     = 'P — (j)(V — I) and in that way we have proved that

     A uniform geometry is called a                    If there are exactly A lines through
every ( points of a design, we say that we have a t — (f,A;,A) design, where                   is
the number of points of the design, and A; the number of points in each line. In
particular any ( — (t;, A;, A) design is regular. We will say that a design is sguore if
its incidence matrix is a square matrix, that is if there are as many lines as points
in the design, a square 2 — (i;, A:, A) design is called a                    design.




                                                59
      T h e o r e m 3.1.5. In general, for a t — {v, k, X) design, if we call b the number
 of lines in the design and r the number of lines through a point, the two following
 equalities hold:
     h — \ v{v-l) ••• (w-t+1)
   ' °             .. (k-t+1)
   • if t > 0 then bk = vr.

      P r o o f The proof is an easy counting exercise. Since every t-uple of points
 defines A lines and from a given line we can get         j ^-uples of points, the number
 of lines is

                                                   k
                                                   t

      The design is regular because by a similar argument the number of lines through
 any given point is
                                          A(r;
                                           f k-i
                                           [t-i
and the rest follows.

     P r o p o s i t i o n 3.1.6. In a symmetric design with parameters (v, k, A), we have

                                              — 1) + A
                                    v =
                                                   A


     P r o o f For the proof we will fix a point P E V and consider all the flags of the
form (Q, I) where Q ^ P and P E I and we will count them in two different ways.

     As there are r lines through f and each one contains A; points, we have r(A — 1)
Sags of that sort. On the other hand, there are u - 1 choices for Q and for every
choice there are A diEerent possibilities for Z yielding a total of A(t; — 1) Sags. Since
the design is symmetric f = 6 and therefore r = A;.                 O

     We could also have proved Proposition 3 . 1 . 6 . as a Corollary to Theorem 3 . 1 . 5 .
where b = v and t = 2.

     We will only deal with designs such that t = 2, that is, there is a fixed number
of lines A through every two points of the design. We will define the orcfer n, for
such a design as n = r — A where r is the number of lines through a point. There
is a general definition of order for a ( — (f, A;, A) design (where t > 2), but it is of
no interest for us here.

                                            60
      As designs are in particular geometries, the relations between a general de-
 sign, its dual and its complement structure, follow easily from similar results about
 structures and geometries. A more difficult question is that of the relation among
 a ( — (?;, A;, A) design, its dual and its complement. Here we will only tackle that
 question for square ( = 2 designs.

      P r o p o s i t i o n 3.1.7. Given a symmetric design V with parameters (ii, A, A),
 its dual       is a symmetric design with the same parameters.

     P r o o f That         is a design is easy to see since as D is regular (becase it is
 symmetric),           is a uniform geometry.
     As D is symmetric, if we call 6 the number of lines and r the number of lines
 through a point as in Theorem 3.1.5. following that theorem we get that 6 =
 and r = A;. We still have to prove that every two lines of 7) intersect in precisely A
points, and we will use the incidence matrix                      for this part.
     If we call        the identity matrix of order f and                 a t; by   matrix with all its
entries 1, we get that
                                 Mj) • Afp = riy + X(Jv — ly)

where the element rfu on the right means that there are r lines trough each point
and the element A(Ju — A,) comes from the fact that any two points determine A
lines. It is easy to prove that

                                       = (r -                    + (n - 1)A)

and since r > A > 0, M p is an invertible matrix.
     From there we get:
            Mx> •        • -Mp) — (-Md •              • Mj) = rMx> + A ( • Mx> — Mx))
     but
                               Ju '     —   kjy   —     Jv   —        '   Jy

and since           is non singular, we get that

                                      • Mj) = fly + X{Jv ~ ly)

and therefore any two lines of D have precisely A points in common.

    T h e o r e m 3.1.8. Given a non trivial symmetric design V with parameters
(u, A;, A), its complement geometry is a symmetric design with the same order as D
and parameters (f, f — A:, f — 2A; + A).

                                                  61
     T h e o r e m 3.1.9. For a non trivial symmetric design of order n and parameters
   , A;, A), we have that
                                 4?i — 1 < f            M + 1.

     P r o o f By Proposition 3.1.6. we have that:

                                             k{k — 1) + A
                                       v =
                                                  A

In this kind of design n = k — X{v = bhy symmetry, hence k = r by Theorem
3.1.5.) which yields:
                                 . = " ' " ' ' ' + A + 2n.

If we consider the above expression as a function ii(A) where 1 < A < n(n — 1) (if
A > n(n — 1) then f (A) would be a rational number, which is impossible), we see
that it has a concave graph with a minimum at

                                       AQ — 1^72(72   1)

and two maxima at

                                Ai = 1 and A2 =            — 1).

     The two natural numbers closest to Ao are (n — 1) and n, and we have that

                                ?;(?%) =       — 1) = 4n — 1

so t;(A) >471 — 1. On the other hand, for the two maxima values we get that

                             t;(l) =         — n) =     + n+ 1

and therefore f (A) <       + n + 1.
    The two extreme cases of this theorem actually occur:
  . For u = 4n — 1 we get that either the design or its complement have parameters
    2 — (4A + 3,2A + 1, A). Any symmetric design with that set of parameters and
    for any A is called a                           or simply a
  . For II =      + n + 1 we have that either the design or its complement is a
    projective plane, as we shall see in the next section.



                                              62
        There is a limited amount of information regarding the existence of designs for a
 given set of parameters ((,          A;, A) or about the number of non equivalent desings for
 one choice of parameters. The main result about non existence of square 2 — (t;, A;, A)
 designs is (for a proof see [HP]):

        T h e o r e m 3.1.10. ( B r u c k - R y s e r - C h o w l a ) If v, A:, A € Z satisfy

                                             — 1)A = A;(A: — 1)

 then for the existence of a symmetric (f, A;, A) design it is necessary that:
    - If f is even then A: — A is a square.
       If f is odd, then          = (A; — A)^;^ + ( — h a s                 a non-trivial solution in
       integers a;, ^ and z.

       The following corollary is very important when dealing with projective planes,
since it restricts the possible orders for them.

       C o r o l l a r y 3.1.11. If a symmetric design with A = 1 and order n exists, and

                                          M= 1       (mod 4) or
                                          n = 2     (mod 4)

then n can be expressed as a sum                  + 6^ where o, 6 E Z.

       P r o o f Since the design is symmetric and A = 1, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have
that
                                V = k{k    — 1) + 1 = (n + l ) n + 1.

Assume now n = 1 (mod 4) or n = 2 (mod 4), we then have                              = 3 (mod 4) and
therefore ( — 1 ) ^ = — 1 so that from the second statement in the previous theorem,
we have                       and then


                                             "=4+4
                                                   a;"'
where            n E Z. It is well known that an integer is the sum of two square
rationals if and only if it is the sum of two square integers.                   O

       We can obtain similar results about the existence of %-designs of a given order
by using Hadamard matrices. A Hadamard matrix of order n is a square n by
n matrix H whose entries are either + 1 or —1 and such that HH^                            = nl.   We

                                                    63
 can define a generalized version of the permutation matrix that we have used when
 dealing with incidence matrices, a                                 is a square matrix
 whose entries are ± 1 or 0 and such that in each row and column all entries but one
 are zero.

     T h e o r e m 3.1.12. If i J is a Hadamard matrix of order n and i?, S are gener-
 alized permutation matrices of order n, then H' = RHS is a Hadamard matrix of
 order n. We will say that ^ and jif' are

     It is clear that a class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order n is stable
 under the action of the group of all row and column permutations and sign changes.
In fact, for every class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order M we can choose
 a matrix in the class such that all entries in the first row and column are 1 (which
is obviously not unique for a given class). We will call such a matrix a


     The following result impose a restriction on the order of possible Hadameird
matrices:

     T h e o r e m 3.1.13. If   is a Hadamard matrix of order n then n must satisfy
one of the following conditions:




                                   ^n = 0     (mod 4).


     As one would suspect, there is a strong relation between Hadamard matrices
and ^/-designs:

     T h e o r e m 3.1.14. Let H he & normalized Hadamard matrix of order n > 4. If
we delete the first row and column of    and substitute all —1 entries by 0, we obtain
a matrix Mg, which is an incidence matrix for a square design       with parameters

                                        _ n, — 2 n — 4



that is, a "^-design. Conversely the incidence matrix of any Hadamard 2-design for
a given A becomes a normalized Hadamard matrix of order 4(A + 1) by the reverse
procedure.



                                         64
      E x a m p l e 3.1.15. H is a, normalized Hadamard matrix of order 8, if we apply
 the method described above to it, we get Mjrano which is an incidence matrix for a
 square design with parameters 2 — (7,3,1) that is in fact the Fano plane and that
 will be described in the next section.

     As we will see, the result in this example is in fact true for any normalized
Hadamard matrix of order 8. By Theorem 3.1.14. any such a matrix will yield
an incidence matrix for a symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, whose complement is a
symmetric 2 — (7,4,2) (see Theorem 3.1.8.). As there is only one symmetric 2 —
(7,4,2) design (the 2-biplane, see the proof of Proposition 3.3.5.), there is only one
symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, the Fano Plane.

     3.2. Projective planes
     A                      is a geometry that satishes the following three axioms:

     • Two distinct points are contained in a unique line.
     • Two distinct lines intersect in a unique point.
     • There exist four points of which no three are incident with the same line.

     T h e o r e m 3.2.1. A finite projective plane is the same as a symmetric design
(t;, A, 1) with A; > 2.

     P r o o f Given V a symmetric [v, k, 1) design, since A = 1 it is true that any two
distinct points are contained in a unique line, and by Proposition 3.1.7. the second
projective plane axiom is also true. As A: > 2, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have that

                             V   = k{k — 1) + 1 > 3{k — 1) > k.

     As       > A: we can choose three points f i , f g , ^3 not in the same line, and call
     the line incident with         and      It is easy to see that

                                    U ^{2,3} U ^{i,3}| = 3(A; — 1)

                                             65
 and so we can choose a fourth point           of the design so that the third axiom is also
 satisfied.

      To prove the reverse, we need to show that a projective plane is uniform and
 square. We can take a line Z and a point f 0 Z. By the first and second axiom,
 there are as many hnes incident with f as there are points in / and we shall call
 this number k. Let us take I' any line incident with P , by the third axiom we can
 choose Q 0 r , f " , Q' so that no three of them are incident with the same line. If
 we call r ' the line defined by f      and        T' has A; points, and therefore there are A
 lines incident with Q, which means that there are A: points in T and the geometry
 is uniform. By Theorem 3.1.5. the geometry is also squgire, and by the hrst axiom
 ^ = 2 and A = 1.               O

     We define the orcfer of a hnite projective plane as A; — 1, that is the number a,
such that there are n, + 1 points in each line, and M + 1 hnes through each point.

     C o r o l l a r y 3.2.2. For any symmetric {v,k,X) design with A = 1, we have that
A; = n + 1 and ?; =          M + 1 where n is the order of the design.

     There is an easy way to construct hnite projective planes for which we shall
need the following well known result about hnite helds:

     T h e o r e m 3.2.3. If        is a finite field then \K\ =        where p is prime and
r E Z, r > 1. And for any p'" as before there is a unique finite field of order p"" that
we shall denote

     If we take       to be a finite field, and F to be a 3 dimensional vector space
over K, we can define P{K) to be the structure whose points are the 1-dimensional
subspaces of V, and whose lines are the 2-dimensional subspaces of V, while the
incidence structure is given by the subspace inclusion in V.

    P r o p o s i t i o n 3.2.4. P{K) is a projective plane of type 2 — ( n ^ + n + 1 , n + 1 , 1 )
where n —

    P r o o f To define a 1-dim subspace of V we need to consider any non zero vector
of y , and the fact that any 1-dim subspace contains             — 1 such vectors. Following
that we see that P{K) contains                      + n + 1 points.

    Given a 2-dim subspace, it contains             — 1 non zero vectors, and reasoning as
before we get that it contains            = n + 1 1-dim subspaces, that is, each line in
P{K) contains n + 1 points. Obviously any two different 1-dim subspaces generate

                                              66
 a 2-dim subspace. The incidence structure for the projective plane follows easily
 from the properties of a vector space.

        C o r o l l a r y 3.2.5. There is at least one projective plane of order n for any
 n =       where p is prime and r £ Z, r > 1.

       The two main results about the existence and non-existence of projective planes
 are Corollary 3.1.11. and the corollary above. Little is known in general for any
 other values of n and the smallest value for which we do not know whether there
 is a projective plane with such order is n = 10. There are many projective planes
 that are not constructed in the way mentioned above, for more information on the
 topic see [HP],

       Another important issue is the calculation of the automorphism group of a
projective plane. Although we do not know a general way of calculating automor-
phism groups for an arbitrary plane, we do know it for f (TiC) when |j^| = p'' and
p prime. What follows is the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, that
can be found in many standard books on projective geometry, we will only use what
apphes to hnite projective planes.

    The smallest possible non-trivial finite projective plane is the Fano f ZaMe com-
posed by seven points and seven lines, so that there are three points in any fine,
and there are three lines going through any given point, that is, it is a 2 — (7,3,1)
design. It corresponds to f (22)-               The Fano plane is a
which means that any two different points of it are indistinguishable, i.e. there is
an automorphism of the geometry carrying one point to the other.

    The Fano plane is the only projective plane of order 2, and it is easy to see that
it has 21 bits. We wiU see that its full group of automorphisms has order 168 and

                                                      67
 it is isomorphic to PSL{2,7).     For the most traditional picture of the Fano plane
 with its Eags labelled, see       ^.,8.

      Beside being related to Z2, the Pano plane is closely related to the Snite Eeld
 Z7. In fact, if we consider the set of quadratic residues mod 7, that is, the set
 {1,2,4} and let the transformation z —> z + 1 (mod 7) act on the set of triples
 of Zy, the orbit of {1, 2, 4} by this action is:

            {1,2,4} {2,3,5} {3,4,6} {4,5,0} {5,6,1} {6,0,2} {0,1,3}

 and if we call each of these sets a line, and consider every element M 6 Zy as a point
of a structure, we can see that what we get is the incidence relation of the Fano
plane.

     Since the Fano plane represents a highly symmetric hypergraph, it is only
natural to try to 6nd ways of embedding it as a conformal structure in a highly
symmetric way in a surface. The optimum way of doing this will be to find an
embedding that keeps both its symmetries and its combinatorial properties, while
corresponding to a smooth embedding into a surface.

    If we try to embed it as a regular hyper map inside a Riemann surface, it
is knows that it can be done in two diSerent ways, as a (3,3,3) dessin in the
triangular torus [Wa] or as a (3,3,7) dessin inside Klein's quartic [Si4]. Other
embeddings of Snite geometries in Riemann surfaces as dessing are also discussed
in [Si4]. Embeddings of finite geometries as regular dessins into Riemann surfaces

                                           68
 are closely related to the existence of big subgroups inside the automorphism group
 of the geometry.

       Corollary 3.2.8. The automorphism group of the Fano plane is isomorphic
 to:
                                          f ^1,(2, 7)

 which is the simple group of order 168.

       P r o o f Immediate from Corollary 3.2.7. and the fact that (for a proof see for
 example [Di])

       3.3. Biplanes

       A generalization of finite projective planes arises naturally when we allow two
lines to intersect in more than a point (respectively when we allow two points to
dehne more than one line), if A is the number of points that belong to two different
lines, we will call these generalization               (6%- and (n- for the cases A = 2, 3).
So a           is a symmetric geometry that satisfies the following two axioms:

       - Two distinct points are contained in exactly two distinct lines.

       - Two distinct lines intersect in exactly two distinct points.

       Finite biplanes have been much less studied than standard projective planes,
and we only know 17 different examples of them [Po]. We will associate with every
biplane its order, which is the number n such that every line of it has n + 2 points. As
far as we know nobody has tried to End smooth embeddings of biplanes in Riemann
surfaces before. The 17 known biplanes have orders in the set {1,2,3,4,7,9,11}.
By Theorem 3.1.10. there are no biplanes of orders {5,6,8}. The Erst example of a
biplane is a 2 — (4,3,2) design, which is a biplane of order 1. It is immediate to see
that there is only one possible incidence structure for such a biplane where every
line is determined by the only point not belonging to it. The biplane of order 1 has
   = 12 Sags and can be embedded into the sphere, since we can see it as a regular
map of type (3,2,3) i.e. a tetrahedron. For two diSerent pictures of the biplane of
order 1 see        ,9. J. We have already seen that its complement is not a geometry
in Example 3.1.2.

                                             69
        The second example of a biplane is a 2 — (7,4,2) design which corresponds to
 biplanes of order 2. We will later see that there is only one possible incidence struc-
 ture for biplanes of order 2 and 3 (see Theorem 3.3.3. and the proof of Proposition
 3.3.5.), although that is not the case for biplanes of higher orders, as there Eire 3
 biplanes of order 4 [Hus], and 4 biplanes of order 7 [MS].

        The biplane of order 2 is the complement of the Fane plane, it has 7 points and
 7 lines, but there are four points in each line making a total of 28 bits. Its group
of automorphisms is again f 5'Z,(2, 7) (see Proposition 3.1.4. or Proposition 3.3.5.)
and it is a 2 — (7,4, 2) design. For a picture of this biplane see         .9.^. where the
thick circle is highlighted because it also meets the central vertex.

        Since there is no subgroup of f 5'i,(2,7) of index 6, it is not possible to embed
this structure as a regular hypermap or hypergraph into a Riemann surface with
PSL{2, 7) as its automorphisms group. Nevertheless, we will show an alternative
representation of its incidence structure into Klein's Riemann surface in chapter
four.

    The biplane we are most interested in is the biplane of order 3, which has
11 points and 11 lines, and Eve points in each line making a total of 55 bits. Its
full group of automorphisms has order 660 and is isomorphic to f5'i^(2,11). Since
it is the only biplane of order three, we will refer to it as the 3-biplane. It is a
2 - (11,5,2) design.

    The 3-biplane is related to the quadratic residue classes of Z n in precisely
the same way as the Fano plane with Zy. That is, if we take the set of quadratic
residues mod 11, A = {1,3,4,5,9} and construct eleven sets of five elements by

                                            70
 considering the action oi 4> •. z i—> z + 1 (mod 11), we can regard the elements
 n G Z i i as points of the 3-biplane where the lines are represented by            where
 r e Zii.




     To calculate automorphism groups of biplanes we need to introduce Hussain
graphs [Hus]. We will see their importance when dealing with the automorphism
group of the 3-biplane. A                      is a graph associated to any line Z in a
biplane B and any point Q 0 Z. The vertices of the graph are those of the line Z,
and two vertices f , f   G Z are joined by an edge of the Hussain graph if and only if
there is a line of the biplane through P , P' and Q.

    We will use the notation Z-Hussain set (or simply Z-H) to refer to the set of
Hussain graphs associated with the line I and [Q, /]-Hussain graph (or [Q, Z]-H) to

                                          71
 refer to a particular graph in the /-Hussain set. The importance of Hussain graphs
 is that a line Z E B and the whole set of Z-Hussain graphs completely determine the
 biplane B, for a proof see Theorem 3.34 in [HP].

        We will say that the Hnssain graphs [Q,Z]-H and [Q%Z']-H are isomorphic, if
 they are isomorphic as graphs. Two Z-Hussain sets Z-H and Z'-H are isomorphic if
 there is a bijection from the point set of Z-H to the point set of Z'-H that induces
 isomorphisms between their graphs.

       P r o p o s i t i o n 3.3.1. Given a biplane B and a line I G B any two /-Hussain
 graphs share exactly two edges and these two edges do not share a vertex. Further-
 more, every Hussain graph is a divalent graph.

       P r o o f Let us choose two points Q', Q ^ L since 5 is a biplane, there are two
lines through Q and Q' that we will call Zi and Z2. Four new points appear when
we consider the intersections Zi n Z = {^1,^2}, Z2 H Z =                    where      ^       if
% ^ J, since otherwise Zi and Z2 will have more than two points in common.

       It is immediate to see now that f i f z and ^3^4 are two shared edges by [Q, Z]-H
and        Z]-H and that they do not share a vertex. If there were a third common
edge, that will mean that there is a third line through Q and Q' different from Zi
and Z2, in contradiction to the fact that B is a biplane.

       Given f any vertex in [Q,Z]-H, there are only two hnes going through f and
Q and each one deSnes an edge of f , therefore any vertex has only two edges and
the graph is divalent.

       C o r o l l a r y 3.3.2. A [Q, Z]-Hussain graph is a disjoint union of polygons whose
vertices are the points of Z.

       P r o o f Immediate since the graph is divalent.

       T h e o r e m 3.3.3. Two biplanes B and B' are isomorphic if and only if for any
line Z E B there is a line Z' E        such that the Z-Hussain set is isomorphic to the
/'-Hussain set.

       P r o o f Take / G 5 to be a line, and (j) : V —>- V the bijection between the
point sets induced by the isomorphism.

       We will call Z' = (^(Z) and assume Q a point of B and Q 0 Z. Let us call
Q' =         a]:id choose         E Z so that the edge ^1^2 is in [Q,Z]-H. That means
that there is a third line h in B so that { P i , P 2 , Q ) E Zi, which in turns mean

                                             72
 that                          are points of the set            that is a hne in B', since   is
 an isomorphism. Therefore the edge                     is in               and the graphs are
 isomorphic.

        Let us assume now that there are two sets Z-H and I'-Yi that are isomorphic
 and that ^ : Z-H —> Z'-H is the bijection between the point sets of Z and Z' that
 defines the isomorphism, so we have aheady dehned the images of any point in Z.
 Take Q 0 Z a point of B, ^ takes [Q, Z]-H to a graph in Z'-H that we call [Q', Z']-H,
so that we can define ^ ( Q ) = Q' and therefore we have extended the definition of ^
to a bijection of the whole point set of B. All we need to prove is that it preserves
the incidence structure.

        That    takes lines to lines is clear, since given a line Zi in B diSerent from Z,
we know that Zi n Z = {^1,^2} and taking Q E Zi and Q 0 Z, as [Q,Z]-H goes to
[Q%Z']-H, there must be a line Z^ through               and            diSerent from Z', and
so we call i/'(Zi) = Z^. We have then a bijection of the point set that preserves the
lines and the incidence relation.

        C o r o l l a r y 3.3.4. Given B and B' two biplanes, and lines I G B and V G i?',
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphisms               : jB —
such that (^(Z) = Z' and the set of isomorphisms of Hussain sets taking Z-H to Z'-H.

    P r o p o s i t i o n 3.3.5. The automorphism group of the biplanes of order 1, 2
and 3 are isomorphic respectively to ^'4, f            7) and f             11).

    P r o o f Let us call B i , B2 and B3 the biplanes of order 1, 2 and 3. As
has only four points,               < 5'4. If we consider its model as a tetrahedron,

                                               73
 we see that the orientation preserving and orientation reversing symmetries of the
 tetrahedron are an automorphism of B i , therefore               = ^'4.

      For B2 we use the fact that B2 is the complement of the Fano plane, and
 Proposition 3.1.4. In that way Aut{B2)         = Aut{Fano)   = PSL{2,7).   We could as
 well have calculated ^1/^(^2) using its set of Z-H graphs, if we had done so we would
 have seen that ther is only one way of drawing an Z-H set (see                   for a 2
 biplane, and therefore by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one biplane of order 2.

     Finally for ^ 3 we need to consider its /-Hussain graphs. A divalent graph on
five points must be a pentagon, and there are only Ave ways of drawing a divalent
graph on five vertices so that it shares exactly two non consecutive edges with the
pentagon. The six elements of any Z-Hussain graph of B3 can be seen in f               g.

     Since there is only one way of representing an Z-H set, all the Z-Hussain graphs
are isomorphic, (and hence, by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one possible biplane
of order three) and there are automorphisms of B3 taking any line to any other
line, i.e. the automorphism group is transitive in the line set, and therefore in the
set of Z-H sets. Furthermore, we will see that the group of automorphism of an Z-H
set is isomorphic to A5:

     It must be a subgroup of ^'5 but it does not contain any transpositions or
4-cycles, since the action of both transpositions and 4-cycles always Sx two consec-
utive edges of the pentagon, therefore it is a subgroup of A5. If we consider the
action of a 3-cycle we see that all of them are automorphisms of the set of Z-Hussain
graphs, so the stabiliser of any Z-H set is in fact ^^5. As there are 11 lines in B3 and
the action is transitive, \Aut{B3) \ = 660.

     We will now show that Aut{Bz)       is simple, and since there is only one simple
group of order 660, that will prove that Aut{Bs)      = PSL{2,11).

     Take Z a line of B3, as the automorphism group of the Z-H set is isomorphic to
the alternating group A5, by Corollary 3.3.4. we get that

                                     StabiV) = A^.

Furthermore, since ^ ^ ( ( B s ) is transitive on the set of lines, aU the stabihzers are
conjugate and ^fa6(Z) ^^1/^(^3) for any Z E /Zg,.

    Let us assume that G = C n and G o ^ ^ ^ ( 5 3 ) . For this to happen there must
be only one 11-Sylow subgroup in ^ ^ ( ( B s ) . Since any two lines Z, Z' share two

                                           74
  points, using Hussain graphs it is easy to see that




 on the other hand, given Z and Z' two hnes, there are precisely three other lines t//Zj)
 2 E {1,2,3} such that

                                        I^W(Z) n                     n                  = 2.

 As any element of                             of order diSFerent from 11 belongs to a line stabilizer,
 we can count all elements of order different to 11 by using the previous facts, and
 we get


                  1    +        1 1 ^          -     5                 +          ^'(2^)                ^

       There are a number of reasons that justify the study of the biplane of order
three: the biplane provides a geometrical model for the action of PSL{2,11)                                                     in
the same way as the icosahedron and the Fano plane are models for PSL{2,5)
and f 6'Z,(2,7) respectively, therefore throwing some hght into the structure of the
group. As a result of this similarity it is possible to find embeddings for the trun-
cated icosahedron in a Riemann surface (using the same idea that allows us to
embed a truncated cube in Klein's Riemann surface). Finally, both the combinato-
rial structure of the 3-biplane and that of the vertices of the truncated icosahedron
correspond to the combinatorial structure of the cusps of certain congruence sub-
groups of the Hecke group                          Some of the ideas developed in this work were found
in [ K G ] ,

     In this chapter we will explore several embeddings of the Fano plane and the
3-biplane inside a Riemann surface, together with other geometric structures that
are related to them, such as the truncated cube and the truncated icosahedron.
The Fano plane can be embedded as a regular hypermap in the torus and in Klein's
quartic. These are the only embeddings of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap
in a Riemann surface.

     We will also discuss two diSFerent kind of embeddings of the 3-biplane:
   - as a regular hypermap inside a Riemann surface, there are two possibilities,
     inside a surface of genus ^ = 12 and a surface of genus p = 15.
   - as a bipartite graph, there are three possibilities, inside a surface with genus
     ^ = 70, a surface with genus g — 125 and a surface with genus p = 180 We will
     only cover the first two cases in this work.
     Each of the two embeddings of the 3-biplane as a graph that we are going to
study here generalizes different aspects of the Fano plane embeddings mentioned
above. Using them we will explore some interesting relationships among the groups
_P5'-L(2,])) where   E {5, 7, 11}.

                 4.A. The Fano plane as a dessin
       Since we know that the Fano plane has 21 bits, in order to embed it as a regular
 hypermap, we need to find an epimorphism from a triangle group A = [Z, m, n] into
 a group of order 21 such that its kernel is torsion free. The torsion free kernel
 condition together with the fact that the Fano plane has no automorphism of order
 21 forces {f,          C {3, 7}.

      On the other hand, we have already seen in chapter two that there are only
 two non-isomorphic groups of order 21, one of them is the cyclic group C21, and the
 other one is the semidirect product C? x C3 which we call G21 and that is dehned
 by the presentation:


                          < e,    / I            = e / e - =     1>

 where we will assume u = 2 without loss of generality.

      It is clear that there is no surface kernel epimorphism from the triangle group
A =         Ti] (where {/, m,         G {3, 7}) into C21 since there should be an element
in A of order 21, which contradicts the assumptions, so we only need to consider
G21 as the image of the epimorphism. Since C7 < G21, there is only one subgroup
of order 7 in G21, and thus there are only two possible triangle groups for the
epimorphism, either [3,3,3] or [3,3, 7]. We will see that both of them produce an
embedding of the Fano plane.

      4.1. The Fano plane in t h e torus

      This embedding was found by Walsh in 1975 [Wa] and corresponds to a regular
hypermap on a torus. It is related to the toroidal embedding of the complete graph
jiTy. We start by getting a presentation for [3, 3,3] given by:

                         < 0 ,   6,   c I             = a6c = 1 >

where we can dehne the epimorphism (^ : [3,3,3] — G 2 1 by ((921 presented as
above):
                     <^(a) = e        (^(6) =          <^(c) =

and using Riemann-Hurwitz formula it is easy to see that A!'er((^) has signature
(1;    ). It is therefore a torsion free group and corresponds to a torus that we

                                                77
 shall call T. For a picture of a Walsh representation of the embedding see Fig. 4-1-
 where the torus is marked with the thin continuous line.

      It is easy to calculate the modulus of this torus, which is r =                     The auto-
 morphism group                    of any regular map Ai on the torus is hnite and described
 in [CM], while the automorphism group                          of any torus T is continuous and
 hence inhnite. If we calculate                    for this torus, it turns out that                 is
 isomorphic to the groups quotient               where ^ is the subgroup of               generated
 by the transformations:

                       Fig. 4-i- Walsh embedding of the Fano plane



     4.2. The Fano plane in Klein's quartic
     This embedding was fouud by D. Singerman [Si4] in 1986. It corresponds
to an embedding of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap of type (3,3, 7) into a
Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to the automorphism group
of the Fano Plane. It is therefore an embedding into a highly symmetric surface.

    As before we will assume that the presentation of [3,3,7] and that of G21 are
respectively:
  < a, 6, c I                      = 06c = 1 >            < e, / I       = /^ =            = 1>

                                                  78
     Our starting point is an epimorphism 4> '• [3, 3, 7] — G 2 1 defined by

                               = e    (^(6) =                (^(c) =

 and by Riemann-Hurwitz formula we see that the signature of jirer(<^) is (3;                ),
 we will call ^"^=3 the Riemann surface uniformized by

     [3,3,7] is not a maximal triangle group, since it can be embedded into [2,3,7],
 which is maximal [Si2], with index 8. If we consider a presentation for [2,3,7] of
 the form
                        < A, B,C j A'^ =                 = ABC = 1 >

one of the possible set of equations (there are eight ways of doing the embedding)
for the embedding z : [3,3,7] — [ 2 , 3 , 7 ] is :

                                                               z(c) = ^ C . 4

where we can check that z(o6c) =                                         = 1.

     In order to calculate the automorphism group of ^"^=3 we need to End the
normalizer of 7irer(<^) inside f 6'i/(2, R). We will show that                  < [2,3,7], and
since [2,3, 7] is a maximal triangle group (see [Si2]), we will have proved that it is
the normahzer of A^er((^). That fact will prove that ^g=3 is Klein's quartic.

    We deEne the group epimorphism $ : [2,3,7] —> f 5'i^(2,7) by:


                          0)                           V)                        1

and we choose a representation of G21 as               < f 5'i^(2,7) where


                           ' = ( 0    5)              ^=(0      1

                                                79
 with the above presentations we see that          = $(z(a;)) for any a; E [3,3,7]. As the
 index of A'er((^) inside [2,3,7] is 168 we know that A'er(i^) — A'er($) and therefore
 ^ e r ( ^ ) < [2,3,7]. We have then proved that

                                             ^ f gz;(2,7)

 and that characterizes         as Klein's quartic, which we can express in complex
 projective coordinates as [Kll]:

                                 3:^2/ + 2/^^ +     = 0.

     The eight different embeddings of [3,3,7] into [2,3,7] correspond to the eight
 diEerent embeddings of a Ggi into fSZ,(2,7), each one corresponding to
 for a given a; G Py. Since we have already chosen           we get the stack of groups
shown in the previous page, where           (7(7^=3) has been explicitly calculated by
Klein in [Kll].

     In the diagram firom the previous page                 refers to the automorphism
group of the dessin, while 5" refers to the stabilizer of the face centres of the dessin,
the horizontal lines on the left are group epimorphisms, those on the right are group
isomorphisms, and vertical arrows designate group inclusions.

     We will only show the embedding that corresponds to                in our notation
because as we have said, the others are conjugate to it by automorphisms of the
surface.

     In order to display the hypermap on the surface, we need to consider 21 special
points on kg=s, and for simplicity we will refer to          < Aut{kg=^) as h when-
ever there is no confusion possible. The action of each subgroup of order seven of
j4u((7irg=3) Axes three points on the surface ([Kll] or direct calculation), and there
are not two subgroups that fix the same point, so if we consider all the points Exed
by each of these subgroups, we get 24 distinguished points, which are actually the
Weierstrass points of Klein's quartic.

    As every triple of points corresponds to the action of a Cy group, and every C?
in f 5'iy(2,7) can be associated to a point in Py, we can see that the action of
on the Weierstrass points splits them into two stable sets, one of them with three
points in it (those Sxed by         the other with 21. We can see the 6rst set as the
face centres of our dessin on the surface, while the second set corresponds to the

                                          80
 set of bits of the dessin. For a Cori representation of the embedding see               ^.,9.
 where the identiScation of the edges of the polygon follows the rule

               2M + 1 ^ 2 n + 6    (mod 14)      where




                                                       o/(Ae f o n o p/ane


     The lighter coloured hyperbolic triangles in                 represent hypervertices
while the darker ones are hyperedges of the dessin, the black points show the bits
and the three face centres of the dessin are highlighted with a light coloured circle.

     4.3. On t h e Fano plane and Klein's quartic

     The embedding of the Fano plane into              is also interesting for its relation-
ship with the cusp set of the principal congruence subgroup of the modular group
of level seven, its relationship with the embedding of the truncated cube in ]irg=3
and the possibility of providing a geometrical model for the 2-biplane.

     We have already mentioned in chapter two that the cusp set of the modular
group r is Q, that r ( # ) is torsion free for every     > 2 and that
where p E Z is prime. We can actually use a stack of groups similar to the one
displayed in previous sections to calculate the cusp set of the action of the principal
congruence group of level seven, r(7) over ZY with the structure of the Fano plane.

                                           81
      It is clear that there is an epimorphism from F into [2, 3, 7], since a presentation
 for r is given by
                         < X, y, z I            = xyz = i > .

      We can easily define it by projecting X onto A, Y onto B and Z onto C
 (where [2,3,7] is presented as in section 4.2.), we will call such epimorphism cr. If
 we consider the special congruence subgroups of level seven, we get the following
 stack:


                              r           ^     >    [2,3,7]
                             ^8                         ^8
                           ro(7)                >     [3,3,7]
                             T3                         T3
                           ri(7)                >     [7,7,7]

                             17                        T?
                            r(7)                >    ks,,3

     Where        is a Riemann surface of genus g = 3 with 24 punctures.

     We will follow Klein in [Kll] to obtain a picture of a fundamental region of
r ( 7 ) in the upper-half plane with a triangulation by triangles of type [2,3, oo]. To
do so we use the transformation z i—> z + 1 to generate six copies of              J. (as
described in [Kll]) and paste them together along consecutive vertical sides. That
leaves us with a hyperbolic polygon with vertices:

                     ib3 -|- 7n i l   3ti ih2 -t- In   —1 -t- In
                         7     '    3    '    7      '    2      ' ^
where M 6 {0, ..., 6}.

     As we know, the punctures on the surface of             correspond to points fixed
by parabolic elements, and all parabolic elements in F project by cr onto elements
of order seven in [2,3, 7], therefore the 24 punctures will project onto the 24 Weier-
strass points of -^^^=3. Reversing the reasoning, as the projection is one to one,
the cusp set of      inherits the Pano plane structure defined using the Weierstrass
points of A7g=3. This embedding, although being very closely related to the one in
      is more interesting, since we can use arithmetic to describe the Pano plane
structure in the set of punctures of r(7).

                                          82
      We will now obtain the set of cusps of            oiit of the set of vertices of a
 fundamental region of r ( 7 ) described above.


                                                                z+l




             Fzp. ^.,9.                                o/r(7) 6^ [2,3,oo].

     By Theorem 2.4.4. two irreducible fractions ^ and ^ represent the same cusp
under the action of r(7) if and only if a = ± a '      (mod 7) and b = ±b' (mod 7),
and we therefore see that either a cusp is equal to oo,        ^ or it belongs to one of
the following families;

                                       1 + 3n 1 + 2n
                                  n,
                                          3 '    2
where ft 6 {0, ..., 6}. Since the hrst three cusps are hxed by the action of z i—^ z + l
and thus correspond to the face centres of the Fano plane embedding associated to
     the other 21 cusps constitute the bits of that same embedding.
    We will prove that for this embedding two cusps ^ and ^ in their irreducible
form share an edge if and only if

                               ah' — a'b = ± 1 (mod 7).

    We assume that the condition holds for a couple of cusps ^ and ^ sharing an
edge. If we let the order seven element act on the shared edge, we get new edges

                                          83
 defined by the couples
                                     o + nb       + Mb'

 where 1 < n < 6 and all of them trivially satisfy the condition.

      On the other hand, any order three element

                                     ^         y \ r-
                                 A= (:         ^ I E Gzi
                                     0         z

 satishes        = ± 1 (mod 7), and if we assume ^ and ^ to be two cusps as before,
 it is trivial to see that
                                  za + 2/6

 also satisfy the condition.

     It sufhces to show that there is at least one edge that satisSes the condition:
let us take the bit represented by 0, an edge of the embedding can only join it to
the following points

                                  ^2' ^3'
     The last four points must be discarded since any edge connecting them to 0
will imply that two hypervertices (or hyperedges) share a bit, which is impossible.
On the other hand, there are precisely four edges incident to any one bit, and in
this case the four edges are represented by the Erst four points. It is now trivial to
check that any of them satis6es the condition above.

     4.4. Embeddings related to PSL(2,7)

     In this section we want to study other geometric structures that can be de-
scribed in terms of the embedding covered in sections 4.2. and 4.3. As we have
already seen that Klein's quartic is equivalent to         without considering its punc-
tures, we will only consider the description of the embeddings into Klein's quartic,
their extension to the cusp set of       should follow easily.

     The other "big" subgroup of f 5'Z,(2,7) has 24 elements and is isomorphic to
5'4, we will show its relationship to the 24 Weierstrass points of Klein's quartic. In
the previous section we were forced to split the set of Weierstrass points into two
subsets, mainly because we were considering the action of a group of order 21, in
this section we will study the action of ^'4 over the set of Weierstrass points and in
order to do that we require the following lemma.

                                          84
      L e m m a 4.4.1.   There are fourteen groups of order 24 (isomorphic to S4)
 inside PSL{2, 7). The action of any of these groups, when considered as subgroups
 of Aut{Kg=z)i   on the Weierstrass points of        is transitive.

     P r o o f The first part follows from [Di], was proved in [Kll] and has been
 calculated in section 2.2. For the second part, we only need to consider that each
 Wierstrass point in Kg=z is the fixed point of a unique C7 < PSL{2, 7) and that
 any proper subgroup of PSL{2,7) whose order is a multiple of 7 is isomorphic to
 either C7 or G21 [Kll]. Thus the only elements in S4 that could fix a Wierstrass
 point are those of order three.




                 Fig. 4-4• Embedding of the truncated cube in K,g=3


     On the other hand, any element of order three is associated to two C7 groups
and therefore it fixes their corresponding sets of Wierstrass points (although it does
not fix the actual points). Since any element of order three fixes just two points on
Kg=3, it is immediate that it cannot fix a Wierstrass point, therefore the stabilizer
of any point is trivial (when considering the action of an S4) and the action of S'4
on the set of Weierstrass points is transitive.           •


    Every embedding of an ^4 into PSL{2,7)         is related to an embedding of a
truncated cube into Kg=3 in which the Weierstrass points of Kg=3 are the vertices
of the truncated cube. We can choose one of the groups S4 displayed in the table

                                          85
 in chapter two, each one containing four subgroups isomorphic to C3. The action
 of any C3 <                on ^(^^=3 Exes two points on the surface, therefore to every
 embedding of an        into f 5'Z,(2, 7) we can attach four pairs of points on the surface
 of Klein's quartic, each of these pairs will define a diagonal of the (truncated) cube.

         Each point hxed by an element of order three is the centre of an equilateral
 triangle of area y whose vertices are three Weierstrass points (since they are fixed by
 elements of order 7). In that way we get a triangle corresponding to the truncation
 of one vertex of the cube for every point hxed by an element of order three in the ^'4
 we are considering (i.e. two triangles for each C3). Repeating the same operation
 with every subgroup C3 in ^'4 we get the eight triangular faces of the truncated
 cube. The remaining edges of the truncated cube are easy to And, since every two
 cycle of 5'4 will hx two other points on the surface, these points correspond to edges
 centres of the cube. For a picture of a truncated cube inside J^g=3 see




     There are fourteen such embeddings into two conjugacy classes, but if we allow
orientation reversing automorphism of ^7^=3 they will form a unique conjugacy
class.    To visualize the remaining six embeddings in                   class it suSces
to rotate the truncated cube around the center point of the hyperbohc polygon
shown in               To get a representative of the second class, we have to reAect
the truncated cube along the vertical diagonal of the polygon. To hnish with this
section we intend to provide a model for the geometric action of f5'Z'(2, 7) on seven
points alongside with a model for the 2-biplane inside Kg=2.

     The algebraic action of f 5'i^(2, 7) on seven points is easy to describe as the
action of PSL{2, 7) on its seven subgroups isomorphic to S4 within one conjugacy
class. Considering that every ^'4 in ^t(^(A'g=3) is connected to an embedding of the

                                            86
truncated cube, we can see the geometric action of f 6 ' i , ( 2 , 7 ) on seven points as
the permutation of the seven truncated cubes in a conjugacy class.

     For a diagram of the 14 truncated cubes inside             we only need to rotate
the class representatives displayed in         ^.,5. around the central vertex of the
hyperbolic polygon.

     We can now consider the diagonals of each truncated cube in a conjugacy class
as a bit of a combinatorial structure and thus we get 28 bits in seven sets of four. We
can call each of these sets /meg, so that each line is in fact a truncated cube within a
conjugacy class. Furthermore, we can choose seven new sets of four diagonals, that
we shall call         so that every point shares only a bit with four lines, and every
line shares just one bit with four points. In doing so what we get is a model for
the 2-biplane inside -^^^=3. We have seen that each diagonal can be associated to a
C3 < f 5'JL(2,7) and that the set of "lines" is identified with the set of subgroups
5'4 in one conjugacy class. Using a similar reason, the set of "points" is identified
with the set of subgroups ^'4 in the other conjugacy class, as we can see in the table
in chapter two, where f stands for points and 2, for lines, and the coordinates of
the C3 label the incidence structure of the bits of the 2-biplane.

                   4.B. The 3-biplane as a dessin
     The 3-biplaiie has 55 bits, so to embed it as a regular hypermap our Erst concern
is the structure of the groups of order 55. We have already seen in chapter two
that there are only two groups of order 55: the cyclic group C55 and the semidirect
product Cii x C5 that we call G55 and has a presentation:




where       E {3,4,5,9}. We shall use w = 4 unless otherwise stated.

     Using the same ideas explained in the study of the embeddings of the Fano
plane, we can discard C55 (there is no subgroup of f                 11) isomorphic to C55)
and state that there are only two possible embeddings for the 3-biplane as a regular
hypermap, these embeddings arise when we consider the triangle groups [5, 5,5] and
[5,5,11].

     4.5. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=i2

    This embedding corresponds to a hypermap of type [5,5,5] inside a Riemann
surface of genus ^ = 12. It arises when one consider the group [5, 5,5] with presen-
tation
                          < G, 6, c I                  = a6c = 1 >

and the epimorphism       : [5,5,5] — G 5 5 dehned by:

                      (^(o) = e     (^(6) = / e   (^(c) =

that induces the following stack of groups.

                            [5,5,5]           ^    >      G55

                              T5                            T5
                            (2;_)                  >        Cii
                             111                            Til
                                                   >        {1}

    [5,5,5] is not a maximal triangle group because it satisfies [Si2]

                [5,5, 5] < [3,3,5] < [2,3,10]     or      [5, 5,5] < [2,5,10]
 and there are no other inclusions for [5, 5, 5]. As it is not maximal, we need to do
 some extra calculations to find Aut{Rg=i2)-

      If we take [2,5,10] with presentation

                             < v4, g , C I                                  = 1>

 we can define the inclusion % : [5,5, 5] — [ 2 , 5 , 1 0 ] by

                               %((i) — vlBA,                 g     z(c) =

      Let us consider a group isomorphic to T^no (defined as in Lemma 2.A.6.) with
presentation:

              < e, / , g I                                                            = 1>

and the map $ : [2, 5,10] —>- ^ n o given by:

                        $(A) =                $(B) = / e         $(C) -          V"

which we can prove to be an epimorphism since $(ylC) =                                We can see that
A'er($) is torsion free in the usual way. If we calculate the restriction of $ to [5,5,5],
we see that                         for any z 6 [5, 5,5] and using indexes calculations as we
have done before,                  < [2,5,10]. As [2,5,10] is a maximal triangle group, we
have proved that
                                          Aut{Rg=^i2) — Hiio-

     Since [2,5,10] is a triangle group, we can consider the dessin induced by the
inclusion jirer(<^) < [2, 5,10] which is a dessin with 110 bits that derives from the
3-biplane embedding by a standard procedure that we call                                      We can
obtain a geometric representation of a Walsh double of a hyper map by taking its
Walsh representation and painting all vertices black, the bipartite map we get is a
Walsh double of the original hypermap.

     4.6. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=i5
     This embedding appears when one consider the triangle group [5,5,11] with
presentation
                               < o, 6, c I                   = a6c = 1 >

and the epimorphism             : [5, 5,11] — G 5 5 given by:

                                      e      <^(6) = e   /         <^(c) = / .


                                                    89
     Using Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we see that the underlying Riemann surface
has genus ^ — 15 and we get the following group diagram:


                          [5,5,11]                        G55

                             T5                           T5
                          (0;[ll5])                ^      Cn
                             ^11                          %11
                          A'er(i;6)                >      {1}

     As in the previous case [5,5,11] is not a majcimal triangle group [Si2], and is
not contained in any other triangle group except:

                                   [5,5,11] < [2,5,22].

We will prove nevertheless that                  = 55.

    Using the same ideas as before, we suppose there is a torsion free kernel epi-
morphism $ : [2,5,22] —>              where jif is a group such that [ ^ : Gss] = 2.
Since ^ must have an element of order 22,              ^ 9^no-   On the other hand, if
^ = Giio = G55 X Cg,               must have order ten, where        and B are respec-
tively elements of order two and five in [2,5,22], and therefore it is impossible to
dehne such an epimorphism, so we have proved that

                                  Aut{Rg=l^)    = G55.




                                           90
         4.C. T h e 3-biplane as a confbrmal graph
     The two examples mentioned above Eire the only possible embeddings of a 3-
 biplane as a regular dessin in a Riemann surface, as any other epimorphism from a
 triangle group       n] to G55 will produce torsion. Unfortunately none of them is
 into a Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to f ,9jL(2,11).

     Since we are trying to End embeddings of the 3-biplane that mirror as closely
 as possible the characteristics of Singerman's embedding of the Pano plane, there
 Eire two important questions that we need to solve:

     - Is there any other way of embedding the 3-biplane in a "rigid way" into a
Riemann surface 5" such that v4M^(5') = f 5'i,(2,11)? That is, is it possible to embed
the bipartite graph representing the 3-biplane incidence structure conformally into
a Riemann surface S such that Ai6((5') = f 5'Z,(2,11) and so that the stabilizer of
the embedding is isomorphic to G55?
     - Among the solutions to the previous question, can any of the surfaces 5" be
uniformized by a principal congruence group          of a Hecke group         in such a way
that the bits of the embedding can be thought of as cusps of G?
     The answer to both questions is ahrmative, there are at least two surfaces 5^
that solve the 6rst question, and one of them is a positive answer to the second.

     We need to relax some of the conditions for the embedding, since we know that
there is no solution for it among dessins. We chose to relax the conditions relating
to the "faces" of the embedding (as seen in a Walsh representation), therefore our
embedding will not be a dessin, but only a bipartite graph, since the connected com-
ponents of the complement of the graph (faces) will no longer be simply connected.
This relaxation implies algebraically that we will consider groups A' with three pe-
riods and signature                 where ^ ^ 0, as candidates for the epimorphism
onto G55. Unfortunately these groups are not rigid in the sense of Fuchsian groups,
and so we will place a restriction on them by studying only those that are subgroups
of triangle groups [(,m,   that projects epimorphicaily onto f ^ i / ( 2 , 1 1 ) .

    Let us start then with a triangle group A = [/,m,           that projects epimorphi-
cally via $ onto PSL(2,11) so that its kernel has index 660 and is torsion free. The
torsion free kernel condition limits the choice of periods for the triangle group to
the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11}. We need to impose a further condition: that there is a
subgroup A' < A with [A : A'] = 12 and signature
                               A = < g, [li, I21 ^3]

                                           91
 that is, three finite periods {U ^ 0) such that the restriction       is an epimorphism
 onto G55. This implies that A' has one of the following signatures:

                        =                    or    A' = (g;[5,5,5])

 which implies that there is at least a period of order multiple of 5 in A, using the
 condition that limits the choice of periods in A, we can eissume that A = [5,
 Since the index of A' in A is 12, we have that 12//(A) = //(A'), that is:


       5                                            55             \   5   m   n

where m , » E {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11} and ^ E N. Out of the set of hyperbolic triangle
groups that could be candidates for A, we can see that only [2,5,11], [3,5,11] and
[5,6,11] satisfy all the conditions, and therefore are the only ones that might allow
an embedding of the kind described above.

     In the first case ([2,5,11]), which seems to be the most interesting, the embed-
ding will be into a Riemann surface of genus p = 70. In that case we will be able
to extend the 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of a congruence subgroup of the
Hecke group

     In the second case the underlying surface has genus p = 125, while in the leist
case A ' has signature (3; [5,5,11]) and the underlying surface has genus p = 180. In
all three cases the bipartite graph has type (5,5,11) meaning that it is invariant by
rotations of order eleven around its "face" centres, or rotations of order 6ve around
its vertices. We will only cover the Erst two cases as the third one does not show
any interesting properties not covered by the other two cases.

    4.7. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=70

    In this section we will explain the embedding of the 3-biplane that most closely
resembles that of the Fano plane in Klein's quartic. We start with the triangle group
[2, 5,11] with the following presentation:


                     < A, B, C I                   = ABC = 1 >

and we dehne a map $ : [2,5,11] —> f 6'Z,(2,11) by:




                                          92
      It is clear that           is torsion free, since every Enite order element in [2,5,11]
 is projected onto an element of f 5 ' i ^ ( 2 , l l ) of the same order, thus                  uni-
 formizes a Riemann surface of genus ^ = 70 (Riemann-Hurwitz formula) that we
 call ^g=70' By its construction and the fact that [2,5,11] is a maximal triangle
 group, we have proved that

                                  Aut(;Zg=7o) = f ^ i : ( 2 , i i ) .

     We know that f = (1; [5, 5,11]) < [2,5,11] and if we take a presentation for f
 given by:


                   < G, 6, c, z, 1/ I                                           = 1>

 we see that % :             [2, 5,11] can be defined by:


                    %(a) =                                 %(6) -

                 %(c) =                 z(a;) =                    2(3/) =

     If we consider now the restriction ^ : (1,[5,5,11]) — f 5 ' i } ( 2 , 1 1 ) defined as
^(a;) = $(%(a;)) for any z G (1,[5,5,11]), we see that                              = Ggg and so we
can construct the following stack of groups where horizontal lines denote group
epimorphisms and vertical arrows symbolize group inclusions.


                                 [2,5,11]                             fgi;(2,ll)
                                   ^12                                       %12

                              (1;[5,5,11])             ^       >             Ggg
                                   ]^55                                      ]^55
                                jiL'er(^)                      >             {1}

    To find the structure of the bipartite graph on the surface we need to consider
one set of 22 points that will correspond to the vertices of the bipartite graph, and
another one of 55 points that correspond to edge centres (bits).

    We will call         the image of the embedding of the group Ggg into the automor-
phism group of ^g=7o- k chapter two we have seen that there are twelve diSerent
subgroups of order 11 in f 6'Z,(2,11). If we consider them as subgroups of the au-
tomorphism group of J?g=7o, we can see that each subgroup C n fixes five points on

                                                  93
 the surface, and no two subgroups Hx the same point, so we have 60 distinguished
 points on the surface. If we remove from this set the five points fixed by the action
 of jif (i.e. the five points hxed by C^i), we obtain a collection of 55 points that are
 transitively permuted by the action of ^ and that corresponds to the bits of the
 embedded graph.

     The remaining 22 points arise naturally when we consider the action of the
order five subgroups of 77. There are 11 such subgroups, each one Axes two points
on the surface, and therefore we have found the 22 points we needed. The choice of
colour is arbitrary, we need to hx one of the C5, for example C ^ ' ° , and paint one
of its fix points white, the other black. If we let        acts on this pair of coloured
points, we will get the colouring for the remaining.

     Since there are 12 diSerent embeddings of G55 in f 5 ' i , ( 2 , l l ) , there are 12
ways of embedding the bipartite graph (not considering swapping the colours of the
vertices), but all of them are conjugate by an automorphism of the surface.

     4.8. Embedding the 3-biplane inside j%g=i25

     This embedding arises when one consider the triangle group [3, 5,11] with pre-
sentation:
                        < A,          C I            = ABC = 1 >

and the group epimorphism $ : [3, 5,11] —^ f 5'i,(2,11) dehned by:


                             I ) .      $(ij)=([   ;»).                   I).

It is easy to check that $ is an epimorphism with a torsion free kernel, and that
7irer($) uniformizes a Riemann surface of genus ^ = 125 that we call 7(g-i25- We
can prove that F = (2, [5, 5,11]) with presentation

          < a;, ?/, z, (, a, 6, c I                                     = 1>

is a subgroup of [3, 5,11] and using Schreier's method And the following equations
for the inclusion % : F — [ 3 , 5,11]:



                      %(«) =
       2(6) =                                              2(c) =


                                             94
      With all the group maps defined as before, we can restrict $ to f in which
 case we obtain a group epimorphism onto             and the following stack of groups:


                             [3,5,11]            ^      >   fgi:(2,ll)
                                 -[12                            %12
                           (2; [5, 5,11])               >        Ggg
                                 %11                            %11
                                                        >        {1}

     So what we get is another conformal embedding of the 3-biplane as a (5,5,11)
bipartite graph inside ^^=125-

     4.9. Other considerations for the 3-biplane and Rg-jo

     Among all the possibilities displayed above, the embedding of the 3-biplane
into ^g=:7o as a bipartite graph seems the most interesting one because we can 6nd
a fair amount of relations between it and Singerman's embedding of the Fano plane.
Among them we will give a 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of           (4 — \/5) and
show a geometric action of f 6'i^(2,11) on eleven objects on the surface Ag=7o-

     In chapter two we have introduced the Hecke group             and we saw that its
signature as a Puchsian group is [2,5,00]. Following the ideas explained in Singer-
man's embedding, we can easily define an epimorphism ^                   ^ [2,5,11] given
by (presentations for both groups as used before):

                       ^(%) = A         ^(y) = B      ^(Z) = C

that will allow us to extend the 3-biplane structure from Ag-70 to some cusp set of
congruence subgroups of          If we pull-back the subgroups of [2,5,11] by means
of $ we get the group diagram displayed in next page.

    In this case the role of the ideal (7) in the description of Klein's surface is
played either by (4 + \/5) or (4 — \/5), the reason for this is that (11), which would
be the natural choice, is not longer a prime ideal in Z[A5] since it can be factorized
as the product of the previously mentioned ideals. It is trivial to see that ^ extends
easily to an epimorphism onto f 5'i,(2,11) as the following diagram shows.

     So what we get is a Riemann surface of genus 70 with 60 punctures, defined by
 ff5(4^\/5)'                   parabohc elements of [2,5, oo] projects onto elements of order
 11 in [2,5,11], the puncture set of this surface projects onto the points of J?g=7o
that are 6xed by elements of order 11, and reversing the projection, the cusp set of
       — \/5) inherits the structure of the 3-biplane.

    We have seen in Proposition 2.5.6. that the cusp set of j7"(4 — VS) in the
upper half-plane can be described in terms of fractions of Q(\/5) in their canonical
form. We will now label the cusps so that we can obtain a picture of the 3-biplane
embedding associated to the action of Ggg in the cusp set.

                                                   96
        We win represent a fraction in its canonical form ^ G Q(\/5) by the coordinates
 (a, 6) where o, 6 G {0, 1, . . . , 10}, if and only if:

                                   f       mod(4 — \/5)
                                        and
                                   Q = ±6 mod(4 — \/5)
       Using that notation we get the incidence diagram in                     where darker
 pawns represent vertices, lighter pawns represent edges and two points with the
 same coordinates are identiGed.

       4.10. Embeddings related to PSL{2,11)

       In this section we will describe other geometrical structures that can be de-
scribed in terms of embeddings into                 and we will see a geometrical action
of f         11) on eleven objects. As we have seen in the previous section, we can
consider the embeddings as lying on                or Eis displayed in the cusp set of
where
                          7 — (4 + \/5)       or     7 = (4 — \/5).

       The biggest proper subgroup of f 5'Z,(2,11) has order 60 and as we have seen,
it is isomorphic to f 5 ' i , ( 2 , 5 ) . We have already mentioned that there are 22 of
them into two conjugacy classes. They can be seen as the symmetry group of
the icosahedron, in fact, if we take the 60 points Bxed by elements of order 11 on
^g=70, we will see that they correspond to the vertices of a truncated icosahedron
(a football).

       Let us consider any of the possible embeddings of ^4^ into f 6'Z}(2,11), there
are six subgroups of order 5 inside it, and each Cg Exes two points on the surface of
-Rg=7o when we see them as subgroups of its automorphism group. Each pair of fixed
points by a Cg can be seen as a diagonal of the (truncated) icosahedron embedded
on the surface. Every point in that pan- is the centre of an hyperbolic equilateral
pentagon, whose vertices are points fixed by elements of order 11 and in that manner
we obtain the 12 pentagonal faces of the truncated icosahedron on the surface
^g=70- For the hexagonal faces we can proceed in any of two ways: we can study
the action of the subgroups of order 3 on the set of C5, or consider the action of the
subgroups of order two on the surface, each subgroup of order two hxes two points
on the surface that correspond to edge centres of hexagonal edges of the truncated
icosahedron. With some work and a fair amount of calculation it is possible to

                                            97
 obtain a picture for the truncated icosahedron inside Ag-70, although given the big
 genus of the surface and the low order of the highest order automorphism of the
 surface, it shows as much as it conceals and so we will not display it here.

     There are twenty two embeddings of a truncated icosahedron inside Ag=7o, dis-
 tributed into two conjugacy classes, although orientation reversing automorphisms
 of the surface will take one class onto the other. We will hnish this section by
 showing a model for a geometric action of f 5'Z(2,11) on eleven points that is re-
 lated to a model for the 3-triplane inside _Rg=7o (The definition of a triplane follows
 naturally as a generalization of the one for a biplane).

     The geometric action of f          11) on eleven objects is related to the combi-
natorial objects that are stabilized by A5 < f ^2/(2,11) and that can be embedded
into Ag=7o, so the truncated icosahedron is the obvious choice for it. If we consider
the eleven truncated icosahedra inside a conjugacy class, each one is linked to one
embedding of /Is inside a conjugacy class, and so the algebraic action of f 5'i,(2,11)
on the A5 of one class is analogous to its geometric action on the embedding of the
truncated icosahedron corresponding to that A5.

     Following the same ideas displayed in the sections regarding the Fano plane,
we can consider the diagonals of each embedding of a truncated icosahedron as
bits of a combinatorial structure, and we can label them using the labelling for the
subgroup isomorphic to C5 in f 5 ' i ^ ( 2 , l l ) whose pull-back into A'u((Eg=7o) &xes
that diagonal. If we do so, we can take the icosahedrons in one conjugacy class
as "lines" of an incidence structure (CZoss iL in the table in chapter 2) and the
icosahedrons in the other conjugacy class as "points" (CZasg f ) . If we check the
resulting incidence structure, we see that we obtained a model for the 3-triplane,
that is, the complement geometry of the 3-biplane inside ^^=70-

    4.11. Another example of a graph embedding

    In this section we will describe an embedding of the Fano plane into a surface of
genus ^ = 24 that we will call Ag=24. We wiU embed the Fano plane as a conformal
graph in the same way as we have done with the 3-biplane. This is the only possible
rigid embedding of the Fano plane as a bipartite graph with non simply connected
faces into a surface with automorphism group isomorphic to _P5'iy(2,7).

    We will consider the triangle group [3, 4, 7] with presentation:

                     < A, B, C I                  = ABC = 1 >

                                          98
and the epimorphism $ : [3, 4, 7] —^ PSL{2, 7) given by:


                =         :!)         «(«) = ( : ;         4)            =(0 e)'
     It is easy to check that $ is an epimorphism and that the group               is
torsion free and therefore it imiformizes a Riemann surface that has genus ^ = 24.

     We will see now that the Fuchsian group (1; [3,3, 7]) with presentation:

                 < o, 6, c, a;,!/ I                                      = 1>

is an index 8 subgroup of [3,4,7], with the inclusion given by:

                         %(a;) =                 2(1/) =

     2(0) =                           = 1   %(6) =                 2(c) =
    If we restrict $ to ^ in the usual way ^(z) = $(%(z)) for any z G (1; [3,3,7]) we
get the following stack of groups and an embedding of the Fano plane as a bipartite
graph inside ^g=24-
