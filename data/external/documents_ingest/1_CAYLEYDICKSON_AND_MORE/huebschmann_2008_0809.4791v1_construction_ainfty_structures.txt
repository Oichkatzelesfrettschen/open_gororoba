Introduction

We will relate a construction of Kadeishvili’s establishing an A∞ -structure on the homology of a differential graded algebra or more generally of an A∞ algebra with certain
constructions of Chen and Gugenheim. We will then establish the links of these constructions with subsequent developments.
Let R be a commutative ring and A a differential graded algebra over R. Suppose that,
as a graded R-module, the homology H(A) of A is free. Then H(A) acquires an A∞ -algebra
structure that is equivalent to A. Over a field, so that the freeness hypothesis relative to
H(A) is automatically satisfied, this fact is nowadays quoted as the “minimality theorem”
for differential graded algebras— we will discuss the issue of “minimality theorem” below.
Such a result was published by Kadeishvili in 1980 [41]. Over a general ground ring R, a
related result involving HPT was published by V. Gugenheim in 1982 [13]. More precisely,
starting from a simply connected coaugmented differential graded coalgebra C over the
ground ring R that is homology split (e. g. free as a module over the ground ring), the
homology H(C) acquires a coaugmented graded coalgebra structure, and a perturbation
of the ordinary cobar construction relative to the coalgebra structure on H(C) yields an
A∞ -coalgebra structure on H(C) that is equivalent to the original coalgebra C. This is a
version of the “minimality theorem” in the realm of coalgebras. Gugenheim’s approach
relies on a perturbation argument developed over the reals by Chen [7], published in 1977
and, furthermore, in a sense, Theorem 3.1.1 in Chen’s paper [6] establishes a version of the
“minimality theorem”. In 1982, Kadeishvili published a result which extends his original
approach to a more general “minimality theorem” saying that, over a field, the homology
H(A) of a general A∞ -algebra A acquires an A∞ -algebra structure that is equivalent to
A [42].
Because of the present renewed interest in the “minimality theorem”, and to help
the presently young avoid loss of contact with the past, it seems worthwhile explaining
the original insight into the “minimality theorem”. This will place the original results
properly in the literature. The contributions of Gugenheim and in particular those of
Chen seem to have been largely forgotten. Also there has been a debate in the literature

2

to what extent the various constructions of A∞ -structures were explicit; the constructions
by Chen, Gugenheim and Kadeishvili are perfectly explicit. In fact, we hope to convince
the reader that these constructions essentially boil down to the very same basic idea. We
will then relate the old approaches to subsequent ones and show that the recent ones [48]
(6.4), [50] essentially still come down to the same basic idea. In particular we will illustrate
how the constructions in terms of labelled oriented rooted trees [48] (6.4) are instances of
ordinary HPT constructions. This will, perhaps, demystify the labelled oriented rooted
trees method and make it accessible to a wider audience. We will also explain the Lie
algebra case. It turns out that the various constructions establishing the corresponding
statement of the “minimality theorem” in the algebra, coalgebra, Lie algebra situation,
etc. all boil down to essentially the same kind of construction, as comparison of (6.1)–
(6.7), (7.1)–(7.7), and (12.1)–(12.7) below shows.
It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to Tornike Kadeishvili. I am indebted to him
for collaboration and for discussion much beyond that collaboration. Our collaboration
[37] led to a number of results related with the perturbation lemma; in particular we have
elaborated on the compatibility of the perturbation lemma with suitable algebraic structure. The perturbation lemma is lurking behind the formulas in Chapter II of Section
1 of [59] and seems to have first been made explicit by M. Barrat (unpublished). The
first instance known to us where it appeared in print is [3]. By means of that lemma,
in [12], V. Gugenheim developed a lucid proof of the twisted Eilenberg-Zilber theorem
which, in turn, was established by E. H. Brown [2] originally via acyclic models. We
have already mentioned Chen’s construction of a perturbation given in [6], extended and
clarified by V. Gugenheim in [13]. These constructions of Chen’s and Gugenheim’s are
somewhat by hand and do not involve the perturbation lemma. In [19], Gugenheim and
Stasheff extended that construction of a perturbation to the case where the contracted
object is admitted to have non-zero differential. In [24], I had developed the tensor trick,
see Section 9 below, and the idea of iterative perturbation. My collaboration with T.
Kadeishvili involved the tensor trick and iterative perturbations and produced in particular the (co)algebra perturbation lemma. This lemma then enabled us to recover the
perturbations of the kind constructed by Chen, Gugenheim, and Gugenheim-Stasheff in
a conceptual way. It led as well to a lucid proof of the minimality theorem. We also
developed a perturbation theory for a general homotopy equivalence, not necessarily a
contraction. It is, furthermore, worthwhile noting that the labelled rooted trees are lurking behind the (co)algebra perturbation lemma but at the time there was no need to spell
them out explicitly in [37]. We will explain all these and more issues in this paper. At
these days the perturbation lemma and variants thereof are, perhaps, more vivid than
ever, see e. g. [1], [31], [34], [49] and the references there; in particular, the perturbation
theory for a general homotopy equivalence developed in [37] has been taken up again and
pushed further in [49].
I owe some special thanks to Jim Stasheff for a number of comments on a draft of
this paper.

Preliminaries

The ground ring is a commutative ring with 1 and will be denoted by R. Later some
condition has, perhaps, to be imposed upon R so that the symmetric coalgebra on the
R-module under discussion exists but R is not necessarily a field.
Indeed, to avoid confusion, recall that, given the graded R-module Y , for j ≥ 0, the
notation Scj [Y ] ⊆ Tcj [Y ] refers to the submodule of invariants in the j’th tensor power
Tcj [Y ] relative to the obvious action on Tcj [Y ] of the symmetric group Sj on j letters, and
Sc [Y ] refers to the direct sum
c
Sc [Y ] = ⊕∞
j=0 Sj [Y ]
of graded R-modules. Some hypothesis is, in general, necessary in order for the homogeneous constituents
Tcj+k [Y ] −→ Tcj [Y ] ⊗ Tck [Y ] (j, k ≥ 0)
of the diagonal map ∆ : Tc [Y ] → Tc [Y ] ⊗ Tc [Y ] of the graded tensor coalgebra Tc [Y ] to
induce a graded diagonal map on Sc [Y ], so that Sc [Y ] is then the symmetric coalgebra on Y .
See Section 3 of [31]. In particular, let V be a projective graded R-module, concentrated
in odd degrees, and consider the graded exterior algebra Λ[V ] on V . The diagonal map
V → V ⊕ V is well known to induce a diagonal map for Λ[V ] turning the latter into a
graded Hopf algebra. We then denote the resulting graded coalgebra by Λ′ [V ] and, as
usual, refer to it as the exterior coalgebra. Whenever a graded exterior coalgebra of the
kind Λ′ [V ] is under discussion, we will suppose throughout that the resulting coalgebra
is the graded symmetric coalgebra Sc [V ] on V , that is, that the canonical morphism of
coalgebras from Λ′ [V ] to Sc [V ] (induced by the canonical projection from Λ′ [V ] to V ) is
an isomorphism of graded coalgebras. This excludes the prime 2 being a zero divisor in
the ground ring R. In particular, a field of characteristic 2 is not admitted as ground ring.
Indeed in characteristic 2 the entire theory requires special treatment.
We will take chain complex to mean differential graded R-module. A chain complex
will not necessarily be concentrated in non-negative or non-positive degrees. The differential of a chain complex will always be supposed to be of degree −1. For a filtered chain
complex X, a perturbation of the differential d of X is a (homogeneous) morphism ∂ of
the same degree as d such that ∂ lowers the filtration and (d + ∂)2 = 0 or, equivalently,
[d, ∂] + ∂∂ = 0.

(2.1)

Thus, when ∂ is a perturbation on X, the sum d + ∂, referred to as the perturbed differential , endows X with a new differential. When X has a graded coalgebra structure
such that (X, d) is a differential graded coalgebra, and when the perturbed differential
d + ∂ is compatible with the graded coalgebra structure, we refer to ∂ as a coalgebra
perturbation; the notion of algebra perturbation is defined similarly. Given a differential
graded coalgebra C and a coalgebra perturbation ∂ of the differential d on C, we will
occasionally denote the new or perturbed differential graded coalgebra by C∂ . Likewise
given a differential graded algebra A and an algebra perturbation ∂ of the differential d
on A, we will occasionally denote the new or perturbed differential graded algebra by A∂ .

of chain complexes [9] consists of
– chain complexes N and M,
– chain maps π : N → M and ∇ : M → N,
– a morphism h : N → N of the underlying graded modules of degree 1;
these data are required to satisfy
π∇ = Id,
Dh = Id − ∇π,
πh = 0, h∇ = 0,

hh = 0.

(2.3)
(2.4)
(2.5)

The requirements (2.5) are referred to as annihilation properties or side conditions.
Let C be a coaugmented differential graded coalgebra with coaugmentation map
η : R → C and coaugmentation coideal JC = coker(η), the diagonal map being written as ∆ : C → C ⊗ C as usual. Recall that the counit ε : C → R and the coaugmentation
map determine a direct sum decomposition C = R ⊕ JC. The coaugmentation filtration
{Fn C}n≥0 is as usual given by
Fn C = ker(C −→ (JC)⊗(n+1) ) (n ≥ 0)
where the unlabelled arrow is induced by some iterate of the diagonal ∆ of C. This
filtration is well known to turn C into a filtered coaugmented differential graded coalgebra;
thus, in particular, F0 C = R. We recall that C is said to be cocomplete when C = ∪Fn C.
Write s for the suspension operator as usual and accordingly s−1 for the desuspension
operator. Thus, given the chain complex X, (sX)j = Xj−1 , etc., and the differential
d : sX → sX on the suspended object sX is defined in the standard manner so that
ds + sd = 0.
Given two chain complexes X and Y , recall that Hom(X, Y ) inherits the structure of
a chain complex by the operator D defined by
Dφ = dφ − (−1)|φ| φd

(2.6)

where φ is a homogeneous homomorphism from X to Y and where |φ| refers to the degree
of φ.
Let g be a chain complex having the property that the cofree coaugmented differential
graded cocommutative coalgebra Sc [sg] on the suspension sg of g exists. This happens to
be the case, e.g., when g is projective as a graded R-module. Let
τg : Sc [sg] −→ g
be the composite of the canonical projection to Sc1 [sg] = sg with the desuspension map.
Suppose that g is endowed with a graded skew-symmetric bracket [ · , · ] that is compatible
with the differential but not necessarily a graded Lie bracket, i. e. does not necessarily
satisfy the graded Jacobi identity. Let C be a coaugmented differential graded cocommutative coalgebra. Given homogeneous morphisms a, b : C → g, with a slight abuse of the
bracket notation [ · , · ], the cup bracket [a, b] is given by the composite
∆

a⊗b

[·,·]

C −−−→ C ⊗ C −−−→ g ⊗ g −−−→ g.
5

The cup bracket [ · , · ] is well known to be a graded skew-symmetric bracket on Hom(C, g)
which is compatible with the differential on Hom(C, g). Define the coderivation
∂ : Sc [sg] −→ Sc [sg]
on Sc [sg] by the requirement
τg∂ = 12 [τg, τg] : Sc2 [sg] → g.

(2.7)

Then D∂ (= d∂ + ∂d) = 0 since the bracket on g is supposed to be compatible with the
differential d. Moreover, the bracket on g satisfies the graded Jacobi identity if and only if
∂∂ = 0, that is, if and only if ∂ is a coalgebra perturbation of the differential d on Sc [sg],
cf. e. g. [38].
We now suppose that the graded bracket [ · , · ] on g turns g into a differential graded
Lie algebra and continue to denote the resulting coalgebra perturbation by ∂, so that Sc∂ [sg]
is a coaugmented differential graded cocommutative coalgebra; in fact, Sc∂ [sg] is then
precisely the ordinary C(artan-)C(hevalley-)E(ilenberg) or classifying coalgebra
for g and, following [57] (p. 291), we denote it by C[g] (but the construction given above is
different from that in [57] which, in turn, is carried out only over a field of characteristic
zero). Furthermore, given a coaugmented differential graded cocommutative coalgebra
C, the cup bracket turns Hom(C, g) into a differential graded Lie algebra. In particular,
Hom(Sc , g) and Hom(Fn Sc , g) (n ≥ 0) acquire differential graded Lie algebra structures.
Given a coaugmented differential graded cocommutative coalgebra C and a differential
graded Lie algebra h, a Lie algebra twisting cochain t : C → h is a homogeneous morphism
of degree −1 whose composite with the coaugmentation map is zero and which satisfies
Dt = 12 [t, t],

(2.8)

cf. [53], [57]. In particular, relative to the graded Lie bracket D on g, the morphism
τg : C[g] → g is a Lie algebra twisting cochain, the C(artan-)C(hevalley-)E(ilenberg)
or universal Lie algebra twisting cochain for g. It is, perhaps, worth noting that, when g
is viewed as an abelian differential graded Lie algebra relative to the zero bracket, Sc [sg]
is the corresponding CCE or classifying coalgebra and τg : Sc [sg] → g is still the universal
Lie algebra twisting cochain.
Remark 2.1. The terms master equation, Maurer-Cartan equation, Lie algebra twisting
cochain, and integrability condition all refer to the same mathematical object. Historically
the Maurer-Cartan equation came first.
At the risk of making a mountain out of a molehill, we note that, in (2.7) and (2.8)
above, the factor 12 is a mere matter of convenience. The correct way of phrasing graded Lie
algebras when the prime 2 is not invertible in the ground ring is in terms of an additional
operation, the squaring operation Sq : godd → geven and, by means of this operation, the
factor 21 can be avoided. Indeed, in terms of this operation, the equation (2.8) takes the
form
Dt = Sq(t).

6

For intelligibility, we will follow the standard convention, avoid spelling out the squaring operation explicitly, and keep the factor 12 . A detailed description of the requisite
modifications when the prime 2 is not invertible in the ground ring is given in [34].
Finally we comment on the usage of the terminology “minimal”: Given an augmented
differential graded algebra A over a field k, with augmentation map ε : A → k and augmentation ideal IA, its graded vector space of indecomposables Q(A) is the cokernel of the
canonical map IA ⊗ IA → IA induced by the multiplication map of A; since A is a differential graded algebra, this cokernel inherits a differential, and the augmented differential
graded algebra A is said to be minimal when it is cofibrant and when the differential
on the indecomposables Q(A) is zero. Any connected differential graded algebra has a
canonical augmentation. In rational homotopy theory, a minimal model of a connected
differential graded commutative algebra A is a minimal differential graded commutative
algebra mA together with a morphism mA → A of differential graded algebras which is
an isomorphism on homology. Likewise, the differential graded Lie algebra L is said to
be minimal when it is cofibrant and when the differential on the abelianization Q(L) is
zero. A minimal model of a connected differential graded Lie algebra L is a minimal differential graded Lie algebra mL together with a morphism mL → L of differential graded
Lie algebras which is an isomorphism on homology. There are also corresponding notions
of minimal differential graded coalgebra and of minimal model for a differential graded
coalgebra. See e. g. [55] (Section 5) for details and more references. Over a local ring R,
with maximal ideal m ⊆ R, a free resolution
ε

d

d

0 ←−−− M ←−−− F0 ←−−− F1 ←−−−
is said to be minimal when d(Fj ) ⊆ mFj−1 for j ≥ 1. The meaning of the term “minimal”
in the present paper refers to A∞ -algebras, see Section 3 below. While in rational homotopy theory, a homology algebra is not necessarily a Sullivan algebra, suitably interpreted,
the notion of minimality of A∞ -algebras is consistent with the usage of the concept of
minimality in rational homotopy theory. See Remarks 4.2 and 5.2 below.

A∞ -algebras

To introduce language and notation we reproduce a precise definition of an A∞ -algebra
and of a morphism of A∞ -algebras, cf. [60]. Our convention is that a differential lowers
degree by 1.
An A∞ -algebra over the ground ring R is a graded R-module A equipped with a
family {mn }∞
n=1 of R-multilinear maps
mn : A⊗n −→ A
of degree n − 2 that satisfy the identities
X
(−1)r+st mr+1+t (Idr ⊗ ms ⊗ Idt ) = 0

(3.1)

r+s+t=n

A morphism f : A → B of A∞ -algebras is a family {fn }∞

(−1)r+st fr+1+t (Idr ⊗ ms ⊗ Idt ) =
(−1)w mq (fi1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ fiq )

(3.2)

r+s+t=n

where i1 + · · · + iq = n and w = (q − 1)(i1 − 1) + · · · + 2(iq−2 − 1) + (iq−1 − 1).
We now reproduce the familiar equivalent description of an A∞ -algebra structure as
a coalgebra perturbation. To save trouble, we will do this only for the supplemented case.
Thus let M be a graded R-module which comes with a direct sum decomposition M =
IM ⊕ R of graded R-modules. We view M as a graded algebra with zero multiplication
on IM, so that IM can then be interpreted as the augmentation ideal of M. The graded
tensor coalgebra Tc [sIM] (with zero differential) is then the corresponding reduced bar
construction for M; let τM : Tc [sIM] → M be the universal bar construction twisting
cochain, that is, the canonical projection to sIM, followed by the desuspension mapping.
For j ≥ 1, let
mj : (IM)⊗j −→ IM
be a homogeneous degree j − 2 operation and define the coderivation
D j−1 : Tc [sIM] −→ Tc [sIM]
by the identity
mj = s−1 ◦ D j−1 ◦ s⊗j : (IM)⊗j −→ IM.
For convenience, we write d = D 0 . Then
D = D 1 + D 2 + . . . : Tc [sIM] −→ Tc [sIM]
is a coderivation, and so is the sum
d + D = d + D 1 + D 2 + . . . : Tc [sIM] −→ Tc [sIM].
Proposition 3.1. (i) The family {mj }j turns M into an (augmented) A∞ -algebra if and
only if d + D is a differential, that is, if and only if
dD + Dd + DD = 0.
(ii) Given the augmented A∞ -algebras A and B, a family {fj }j of R-multilinear maps
fj : (IA)⊗n −→ IB
of degree j − 1 is a morphism of (augmented) A∞ -algebras if and only if the constituents
of the family combine to a morphism
(Tc [sIA], d + D) −→ (Tc [sIB], d + D)
of differential graded coalgebras.

8

Thus, when {mj }j turns M into an (augmented) A∞ -algebra, in particular, m1 is a
differential on M and on IM, and d is a differential on Tc [sIM], in fact, the differential
induced by that on IM. The special case where only m1 and m2 are non-zero is that of an
ordinary differential graded algebra structure, and (Tc [sIM], d + D) is then the ordinary
reduced bar construction BM.
Kadeishvili introduced the terminology minimal for an A∞ -algebra (M, {mi }) having
m1 zero, i.e. trivial differential. Minimal A∞ -algebras behave similar to Sullivan’s minimal differential graded algebras: each weak equivalence of minimal A∞ -algebras is an
isomorphism. See also Remark 5.2 below.
We will henceforth consider IM as a chain complex, use the notation
BD M = (Tc [sIM], d + D),

(3.3)

and occasionally refer to BD M as the standard construction. It is also customary to write
e and to refer to the bar tilde construction. Apart from Section 4 below, we will henceBM
forth exclusively use the description of an A∞ -algebra structures on the chain complex
M in terms of the coalgebra perturbation D on the associated differential graded coalgebra (Tc [sIM], d). Likewise we will exclusively use the description of an A∞ -coalgebra
structure in terms of the corresponding algebra perturbation on the associated differential graded algebra and we will use the description of an L∞ -algebra structure merely in
terms of the corresponding coalgebra perturbation on the associated differential graded
coalgebra.

Kadeishvili’s minimality theorem for algebras

In [40], Kadeishvili studied the homology of a fiber bundle with structure group G and
fiber F . He noticed that the Pontrjagin ring structure of the homology H∗ (G) and the
action of H∗ (G) on H∗ (F ) in general fail to recover the geometry of the action. To fix this
failure, he then constructed certain higher operations
f i : H∗ (G) ⊗ ...(i times)... ⊗ H∗ (G) → H∗ (G), i = 3, 4, . . . ,
and homomorphisms
Ai : H∗ (G) ⊗ ...(i times)... ⊗ H∗ (G) → C∗ (G), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . .
which are solutions of certain equations. For example, f = f 3 + f 4 + . . ., interpreted as
a Hochschild cochain in C ∗ (H∗ (G), H∗ (G)), satisfies the condition
δf = f ∪1 f
where the operation
∪1 : (a, b) 7→ a ∪1 b
refers to the operation in the Hochschild (cochain) complex introduced by Gerstenhaber.
Kadeishvili referred to this operation as a “cup-one” product since it has the same properties as Steenrod’s ∪1 -product, and he called such an f Hochschild twisting cochain (page
3 of [40]).
9

With hindsight we see that Kadeishvili’s construction just explained yields an A∞ algebra structure (H∗ (G), {f i }) and a morphism (weak equivalence) of A∞ -algebras {Ai } :
(H∗ (G), {f i }) → C∗ (G). While, at the time of writing [40], Kadeishvili did not know about
Stasheff’s notion of A∞ -algebra he realized thereafter that the condition δf = f ∪1 f is
exactly Stasheff’s defining condition for an A∞ -algebra (M, {mi }) with m1 = 0. This led
to the paper [41]. Here is the main result thereof, valid for a general differential graded
algebra, not necessarily of the kind C∗ (G) for a group G.
Theorem 4.1 (Minimality theorem). Let A be a differential graded algebra over a field.
There is an A∞ -algebra structure on H(A) and an A∞ -algebra quasi-isomorphism f : H(A) →
A such that f1 is a cycle-choosing quasi-isomorphism of chain complexes where the differential m1 on H(A) is zero and m2 is a strictly associative multiplication induced by the
multiplication in A. The resulting structure is unique up to quasi-isomorphism. When A
has a unit, then the structure and quasi-isomorphism can be chosen to be strictly unital.
In particular, the A∞ -algebra structure on homology resulting from the minimality
theorem is minimal and this structure, which is of course not uniquely determined, is
unique up to isomorphism in the category of A∞ -algebras.
To compare the original approach with other developments, we partly reproduce the
proof in [41].
Proof. Since A is a differential graded algebra, its associated A∞ -structure is encapsulated
in the operations m1 and m2 , the higher operations being zero. We shall denote m1 by d
and refer to m2 by the notation · or simply by juxtaposition.
To start an inductive construction of an A∞ -structure on H(A), we pick m1 = 0 and
take m2 to be the induced strictly associative multiplication on H(A). Furthermore, we
take f1 to be some linear map H(A) → A that picks a cycle in each homology class.
Given a1 , a2 ∈ A, let
Ψ2 (a1 , a2 ) = f1 (a1 a2 ) − f1 (a1 )f1 (a2 ).
This yields a boundary, since f1 (a1 a2 ) is defined to be a representative cycle of the homology class containing f1 (a1 )f1 (a2 ). Hence, Ψ2 (a1 , a2 ) = dw for some w. Abstracting
from the particular elements a1 and a2 , since we are over a field, we find a morphism f2
such that df2 = Ψ2 .
Now, let n > 2. Given a1 , . . . , an ∈ A, let
Ψn (a1 , . . . , an ) =

n−1
X

(−1)ε1 (a1 ,...,an ,s) fs (a1 , . . . , as ) · fn−s (as+1 , . . . , an )+

(−1)ε2 (a1 ,...,an ,k,j)fn−j+1 (a1 , . . . , ak , mj (ak+1 , . . . , ak+j ), . . . , an )

where the expressions
ε1 (a1 , . . . , an , s) = s + (n − s + 1)(|a1 | + · · · + |as |)
ε2 (a1 , . . . , an , k, j) = k + j(n − k − j + |a1 | + · · · + |ak |)
10

are the signs in (3.2), adjusted according to the Eilenberg-Koszul convention. The term Ψn
arises from the identity (3.2), with the two terms f1 mn and m1 fn removed. To complete
the inductive step we must exhibit suitable terms mn and fn in such a way that the
identity (3.2) holds.
Tedious but straightforward calculation shows that the element Ψn (a1 , . . . , an ) is a
d-cycle, and we take
mn (a1 , . . . , an ) = [Ψn (a1 , . . . , an )] ∈ H(A).
This yields the operation mn on H(A). Since now f1 (mn (a1 , . . . , an )) and Ψn (a1 , . . . , an )
are in the same class, there is some w ∈ A such that
f1 (mn (a1 , . . . , an )) − Ψn (a1 , . . . , an ) = dw.
Abstracting from the particular elements a1 , . . . , an , since we are over a field, we find a
morphism fn such that
dfn = Ψn .
Thus mn and fn match the definitions of the corresponding constituents of an A∞ -algebra
and of a morphism of A∞ -algebras, respectively.
M. Vejdemo-Johansson has observed that this proof can be translated into an algorithm for the computation of the A∞ -structure maps [62]. This justifies the claim made
earlier that Kadeishvili’s construction can be made explicit (by means of a choice of
contracting homotopy, see Remark 7.2 below).
Remark 4.2. Let A be a connected minimal differential graded commutative algebra over
the rationals. Theorem 4.1 applies to it and yields a “minimal” A∞ -structure on H(A),
associated with A. However the two notions of minimality clearly differ unless A is formal.
In 1982, Kadeishvili extended this construction and arrived at a more general “minimality theorem” saying that, over a field, the homology H(A) of a general A∞ -algebra A
acquires an A∞ -algebra structure that is equivalent to A [42].
Remark 4.3. Kadeishvili’s original problem, that is, that of constructing a small model
for the chains on the total space of a fiber bundle, has received much attention in the
literature, as has the problem, given a group G, to isolate, under suitable circumstances,
a suitable structure on the homology H(X) of a G-space X such that X and H(X) are
equivalent in the A∞ -sense. In the de Rham setting, this problem was studied, e.g., in
[11], where the corresponding A∞ -structure on de Rham cohomology is encoded in terms
of what are referred to there as cohomology operations. In [36], we have explained how
equivariant de Rham theory can be subsumed under relative homological algebra. This
includes an explanation of those A∞ -structures on de Rham cohomology.
In the situation of the minimality theorem, Theorem 4.1 above, when the differential
graded algebra A is graded commutative, the resulting A∞ -algebra structure on H(A) has
peculiar features encoded by Kadeishvili in the notion of CA∞ -algebra, meaning that, in
this case, the bar tilde construction is not only a differential graded coalgebra but also
11

an algebra with respect to the shuffle product, and the two structures combine to that
of a differential graded bialgebra. Later this kind of structure has been christened C∞ structure. In the special situation where A is the algebra of rational cochains on a space
X, the resulting C∞ -algebra structure on H∗ (X, Q) determines the rational homotopy
type of X. Kadeishvili has worked this out in [44]; an extended version can be found in
[46].
The general situation is this: Given an augmented C∞ -algebra A, the structure being
given in terms of its standard construction B∂ A, by the very definition of C∞ -structure,
the shuffle multiplication turns B∂ A into a graded commutative differential graded Hopf
algebra, the space of indecomposables relative to the algebra structure is a differential
graded Lie coalgebra Lc , in fact, a perturbation of the cofree differential graded Lie coalgebra Lc (sIA) cogenerated by sIA, and the projection B∂ A → Lc actually spells out the
differential graded coalgebra B∂ A as the universal coalgebra Uc [Lc ] cogenerated by Lc , the
space Lc necessarily being that of indecomposables relative to the graded commutative algebra structure. More formally, the standard construction for the augmented C∞ -algebra
A boils down a perturbation of the cofree differential graded Lie coalgebra Lc (sIA) cogenerated by sIA. In other words, the C∞ -structure on A is given by a perturbation of the
differential on the cofree differential graded Lie coalgebra Lc (sIA) cogenerated by sIA.
In the situation of Kadeishvili’s observation explained above, the differential graded
Lie coalgebra Lc is the dual of the familiar minimal Lie algebra model in rational homotopy
theory. Indeed, the structure dual to that of a C∞ -structure has been explored in the
literature in the context of rational homotopy theory. We will explain this in Remark 5.2
below.
Lie coalgebras are still not widely known objects. See e. g. [51] for a thorough
approach to ordinary (ungraded) Lie coalgebras.

The Chen perturbation

Let X be a (connected) smooth manifold, and let A(X) be its ordinary de Rham algebra.
Our convention is that A(X) is graded by negative degrees, that is, A(X)j = A−j (X)
for j ≤ 0. Let V be a graded vector space which, to avoid unnecessary complications, we
b ] denote
suppose to be of finite type (that is, finite-dimensional in each degree), and let T[V
the graded completion of the graded tensor algebra T[V ] relative to the augmentation
filtration. Let b
TA(X) [V ] be the de algebra of formal power series in a basis of V with
coefficients in the de Rham algebra A(X) of X. More formally, let V ∗ be the graded dual
of V —still of finite type—, consider the graded tensor coalgebra Tc [V ∗ ], and let
b A(X) [V ] = Hom(Tc [V ∗ ], A(X)).
T

b A(X) [V ] is the appropriate completion
Thus, the algebra T

be a contraction of chain complexes. Thus, any α ∈ A(X) can be written as

where H = ∇H(A(X)) plays the role of the Hodge decomposition in Kodaira-Spencer

the language of contractions) is indeed referred to as a “Hodge decomposition”, and on
p. 187 of [7] it is remarked that a Hodge decomposition of the de Rham complex of a
Riemannian manifold is a special case of a decomposition of the kind (5.2), H being the
space of harmonic forms.

then a kind of perturbed reduced cobar construction, and this perturbed reduced cobar
construction is a model for the real chain algebra of the based loop space of X; we therefore
write this differential graded algebra as Ω∂ [H∗ (X)]. In particular, when the higher terms
∂ j for j ≥ 2 are zero, the manifold X is formal over the reals.
13

Chen already established a version of the “minimality theorem”, though not in the
language of A∞ -structures. Indeed, Theorem 5.1, together with Theorem 3.1.1 in [6],
include the statement that, for simply connected X, the real homology H∗ (X) of the
manifold X acquires an A∞ -coalgebra structure such that the chains on X and H∗ (X),
endowed with the A∞ -coalgebra structure, are equivalent. Dualized, this is precisely the
statement of the “minimality theorem” over the reals.
Remark 5.2. Suitably interpreted, Chen’s construction makes perfect sense over the rationals. Let X be a simply connected space and take A(X) to be the graded commutative
algebra of rational forms on X. We continue to denote the resulting differential graded
algebra, now over the rationals, Q, by Ω∂ [H∗ (X)]. The rational homology H∗ (X) acquires a graded cocommutative coalgebra structure whence the shuffle diagonal map turns
Ω∂ [H∗ (X)] into a graded cocommutative Hopf algebra. Thus, by the Milnor-Moore theorem, Ω∂ [H∗ (X)] is the universal enveloping algebra U[L] of a differential graded Lie algebra
L. This differential graded Lie algebra L is in fact the familiar minimal Lie algebra model
for the based loop space on X nowadays widely used in rational homotopy theory. This has
been worked out in [20], [21], [61]; indeed, in the latter reference, the differential graded
Lie algebra L, together with the formal power series connnection, is referred to as the
Chen model for (the rational homotopy type of ) the space X. It is in this sense that the
usage of the term “minimal” in the present paper is compatible with its usage in rational
homotopy theory.
The notion of C∞ -coalgebra is lurking behind these observations. We shall elucidate
this kind of structure in Remark 6.3 below.

Perturbations for coalgebras

Abstracting from the perturbation argument for Chen’s theorem quoted above, V. Gugenheim developed a general perturbation theory for differential graded coalgebras which
includes and explains Chen’s theorem [13]. Gugenheim made it entirely clear that his perturbation argument is formally exactly the same as that of Chen, but placed in a much
more general context. We will now explain a version of Gugenheim’s result, somewhat
more general than the original one in [13]. The proofs of all the claims in this section will
be given in Section 9 below.
Let C be a coaugmented differential graded coalgebra and let
∇

−
→
(M −
←
−−
−
− C, h)

(6.1)

π

be a contraction of chain complexes. The situation considered by Gugenheim in [13] is
the special case where M has zero differential, so that M then amounts to the homology
of C. In the general case, the counit ε : C → R and coaugmentation η : R → C induce a
“counit” ε : M → R and “coaugmentation” η : R → M for M in such a way that (6.1) is
a contraction of augmented and coaugmented chain complexes. Thus M admits a direct
sum decomposition M = R⊕JM; indeed we can view M as a differential graded coalgebra
with zero diagonal on JM, and JM can then be interpreted as the coaugmentation coideal
of M. The differential graded tensor algebra T[s−1 JM] is then the corresponding reduced
14

cobar construction for M; let τM : M → T[s−1 JM] be the universal cobar construction
twisting cochain, that is, the desuspension mapping, followed by the canonical injection.
Let
τ 1 = τM π : C → s−1 JM ⊆ T[s−1 JM]
(6.2)
and, for j ≥ 2, let
τ j : C −→ (s−1 JM)⊗j ⊆ T[s−1 JM]
be the degree −1 morphism defined recursively by
τ j = (τ 1 ∪ τ j−1 + · · · + τ j−1 ∪ τ 1 )h : C → (s−1 JM)⊗j .

(6.3)

Thereafter, for j ≥ 1, define the degree −1 derivation D j on T[s−1 JM] by
D j τM = (τ 1 ∪ τ j + · · · + τ j ∪ τ 1 )∇ : M → (s−1 JM)⊗(j+1) ⊆ T[s−1 JM].

(6.4)

Let b
T[s−1 JM] denote the graded completion of the graded tensor algebra T[s−1 JM],
the term completion being taken relative to the augmentation filtration.

C −→ (T[s

For the special case where M has zero differential so that M then coincides with
the homology H(C) of C, this theorem is essentially Proposition 2.1 in [13]. We will
henceforth write
b D M = (T[s
b −1 JM], d + D).
Ω
(6.7)

Complement 1. Suppose that, in addition, M is a coaugmented differential graded
coalgebra and that ∇ is a morphism of differential graded coalgebras. Then D j is zero for
j ≥ 2 and D 1 is the algebra perturbation determined by the coalgebra structure of M.
Under suitable circumstances, the graded tensor algebra T[s−1 JM] is already complete. This happens to be the case when M is simply connected in the sense that it is
concentrated in non-negative degrees and that JM1 is zero, or when JM is concentrated
in non-positive degrees. In this case, the series
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 + . . . : C → T[s−1 JM],
D = D 1 + D 2 + . . . : T[s−1 JM] → T[s−1 JM]

(6.8)
(6.9)

converge naively in the sense that, applied to a specific element, only finitely many terms
are non-zero. Furthermore, D is then an algebra perturbation of the differential on
T[s−1 JM], and
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 + . . . : C −→ ΩD M
15

is a twisting cochain where we use the notation
ΩD M = (T[s−1 JM], d + D).

(6.10)

At the risk of being, perhaps, repetitive, we point out explicitly that the piece of structure
D in ΩD M is precisely an A∞ -coalgebra structure on M.
Complement 2 to Theorem 6.1. When C is simply connected or when C is concentrated in non-positive degrees, the adjoint
τ : ΩC −→ ΩD M
of the twisting cochain τ , necessarily a morphism of differential graded algebras, is a
chain equivalence. If, furthermore, M is a coaugmented differential graded coalgebra and
∇ is a morphism of differential graded coalgebras, ΩD M is the ordinary reduced cobar
construction on M.
Indeed, in the situation of the “Furthermore” statement of Complement 2, the vanishing of the higher terms D j for j ≥ 2 is a consequence of the annihilation property h∇ = 0
and the construction of the twisting cochain τ comes essentially down to [18] (4.1)∗ . A
result somewhat weaker than the above Complement 2 is Theorem 3.2 in [13] which says
that τ is a homology isomorphism.
Complement 2 to Theorem 6.1 includes the statement that, in the simply connected
case, M, endowed with the A∞ -coalgebra structure D, and C, endowed with the A∞ coalgebra structure associated with the differential graded coalgebra structure, are, via τ ,
equivalent as A∞ -coalgebras.
Remark 6.2 (Lemma 2.2.1 in [13]). Suppose that the differential of M is zero. Then
M amounts to the homology H(C) of C and acquires the structure of a coaugmented
graded coalgebra. In this case, even though neither the morphism ∇ nor the morphism π
in the contraction (6.1) are supposed to be compatible with the coalgebra structures, the
operator D 1 is the ordinary cobar construction differential on the graded tensor algebra
T[s−1 JH(C)] determined by the diagonal map ∆H(C) of H(C). Indeed, write the diagonal
map of C as ∆ as usual. By construction, the diagonal map ∆M of M coincides with the
composite
∇
∆
π⊗π
M −−−→ C −−−→ C ⊗ C −−−→ M ⊗ M.
Consequently
D 1 τM = (τ 1 ∪ τ 1 )∇
= ((τM π) ∪ (τM π))∇
= (τM ⊗ τM )(π ⊗ π)∆∇
= (τM ⊗ τM )∆M .
However the identity
D 1 τM = (τM ⊗ τM )∆M
says that D 1 is the ordinary cobar construction differential. Thus, in this case, ΩD H(C)
is a perturbation of the ordinary reduced cobar construction ΩH(C) over H(C) and thence
endows H(C) with an A∞ -coalgebra structure equivalent to C.
16

Remark 6.3. The concept dual to that of a C∞ -algebra is that of a C∞ -coalgebra: Let
C be a coaugmented differential graded A∞ -coalgebra, with standard construction Ω∂ (C).
Then this A∞ -coalgebra structure on C is a C∞ -coalgebra structure provided the shuffle
diagonal turns Ω∂ (C) into a differential graded Hopf algebra, necessarily graded cocommutative. Exactly the same reasoning as that in Remark 5.2 reveals that the standard
construction Ω∂ (C) of a coaugmented C∞ -coalgebra C is the universal enveloping algebra
U[L] of a differential graded Lie algebra L which, in turn, is a perturbation of the free
differential graded Lie algebra generated by s−1 (JC). Thus the standard construction of
a (coaugmented) C∞ -coalgebra comes down to a perturbation of the free differential Lie
algebra generated by s−1 (JC).
In the special case where, as a differential graded coalgebra, C is an ordinary (coaugmented) cocommutative differential graded coalgebra, the shuffle diagonal plainly turns the
ordinary cobar construction Ω(C) into a differential graded Hopf algebra; this situation
has been explored by J. Moore in [52] and [53].

Perturbations for algebras

We now spell out the situation dual to that in the previous section. Again the proofs of
all the claims in this section will be given in Section 9 below.
Thus, let A be an augmented differential graded algebra and let
∇

−
→
(M −
←
−−
−
− A, h)

(7.1)

π

be a contraction of chain complexes. The unit η : R → A and augmentation ε : A → R
induce a “unit” η : R → M and “augmentation” ε : M → R for M in such a way that (7.1)
is a contraction of augmented and coaugmented chain complexes. Thus M admits a direct
sum decomposition M = R ⊕ IM; indeed we can view M as a differential graded algebra
with zero multiplication on IM, and IM can then be interpreted as the augmentation
ideal of M. The differential graded tensor coalgebra Tc [sIM] is then the corresponding
reduced bar construction for M; let τM : Tc [sIM] → M be the universal bar construction
twisting cochain, that is, the canonical projection to sIM, followed by the desuspension
mapping.
Let
τ 1 = ∇τM : Tc [sIM] → sIM → A
(7.2)
and, for j ≥ 2, let
τ j : Tc [sIM] → (sIM)⊗j → A
be the degree −1 morphism defined recursively by
τ j = h(τ 1 ∪ τ j−1 + · · · + τ j−1 ∪ τ 1 ) : (sIM)⊗j → A.

(7.3)

Thereafter, for j ≥ 1, define the degree −1 coderivation D j on Tc [sIM] by
τM D j = π(τ 1 ∪ τ j + · · · + τ j ∪ τ 1 ) : Tc [sIM]cj+1 = (sIM)⊗(j+1) → M.

(7.4)

In particular, for j ≥ 1, the coderivation D j is zero on Fj Tc [sIM] and lowers coaugmentation filtration by j.
17

Theorem 7.1. The infinite series
D = D 1 + D 2 + . . . : Tc [sIM] → Tc [sIM]

(7.5)

is a coalgebra perturbation of the differential d on Tc [sIM] induced from the differential
on M, and the infinite series
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 + . . . : Tc [sIM] → A

(7.6)

is a twisting cochain
(Tc [sIM], d + D) −→ A.
Furthermore, the adjoint
τ : BD M −→ BA
of the twisting cochain τ , necessarily a morphism of differential graded coalgebras, is a
chain equivalence.
To our knowledge, such a result for a general chain complex M appears in the literature
for the first time in [19]—the special case where the ground ring is a field and where
M has zero homology is due to Chen, as noted earlier. The sums (7.5) and (7.6) are in
general infinite. However, applied to a specific element which, since Tc [sIM] is cocomplete,
necessarily lies in some finite filtration degree subspace, since the operators D j (j ≥ 1)
lower coaugmentation filtration by j, only finitely many terms will be non-zero, whence
the convergence is naive. We will henceforth write
BD M = (Tc [sIM], d + D).

(7.7)

The piece of structure D in BD M is precisely an A∞ -algebra structure on M and Theorem
7.1 includes the statement that M, endowed with the A∞ -algebra structure D, and A,
endowed with the A∞ -algebra structure associated with the differential graded algebra
structure, are, via τ , equivalent as A∞ -algebras. This recovers, in particular, Kadeishvili’s
result, Theorem 4.1.
Complement to Theorem 7.1. Suppose that, in addition, M is an augmented differential graded algebra and that π is a morphism of differential graded algebras. Then D j
is zero for j ≥ 2, the operator D 1 is the coalgebra perturbation determined by the algebra
structure of M, and BD M is the ordinary reduced bar construction for M.
Indeed, in the situation of the Complement, the vanishing of the higher terms D j for
j ≥ 2 is a consequence of the annihilation property πh = 0 and the construction of the
twisting cochain comes essentially down to [18] (4.1)∗ .
In the special case where A has zero differential and the original contraction (7.1) is
the trivial contraction of the kind
Id

(7.8)

Id

M and A coincide, the perturbation D coincides with the perturbation ∂ determined
by the algebra structure on A, and TcD [sM] coincides with the ordinary reduced bar
18

construction for A; the twisting cochain τ then comes down to the bar construction
twisting cochain and in fact coincides with τ 1 . In this case, the higher terms τ j and
D j (j ≥ 2) are obviously zero, and the operator D 1 manifestly coincides with the bar
construction operator.
Likewise, suppose that the differential of M is zero. Then M amounts to the homology
H(A) of A and acquires the structure of an augmented graded algebra. In this case,
even though neither the morphism ∇ nor the morphism π in the contraction (7.1) are
supposed to be compatible with the algebra structures, the operator D 1 is the ordinary
bar construction differential on the graded tensor coalgebra Tc [sIH(A)] determined by the
multiplication map of H(A), and BD H(A) is a perturbation of the ordinary reduced bar
construction BH(A).
Remark 7.2. [Relationship with Kadeishvili’s minimality theorem for algebras] Comparison of the proof of Theorem 4.1 with that of Theorem 7.1 reveals the following: The
terms τ j in the proof of Theorem 7.1 exhibit precisely terms of the kind fj in the proof of
Theorem 4.1, and the operators D j in the proof of Theorem 7.1 yield terms of the kind mj
in the proof of Theorem 4.1. The coalgebra structure of Tc [sM] exploited in the proof of
Theorem 7.1 organizes the otherwise tedious calculations in the original proof of Theorem
4.1, and the usage, in the proof of Theorem 7.1, of the chain homotopy h in the contraction (7.1) removes the ambiguities related with the choices of the bounding chains in the
proof of Theorem 4.1 and thus leads to an algorithm, cf. [62].

8

A proof of Chen’s theorem

We will now briefly explain how Theorem 7.1 includes Theorem 5.1; this will make it clear
that the basic perturbation argument goes back to Chen: Given the smooth manifold X,
let A = A(X) and pick a contraction of the kind (5.1). Thus H is then the de Rham
cohomology algebra of X. The recursive construction (7.3) yields the twisting cochain
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 + . . . : BD H −→ A(X)
and the formulas (7.4) yield the coalgebra differential
D = D 1 + D 2 + . . . : Tc [sIH] → Tc [sIH].
To simplify the exposition we will suppose that the homology of X is of finite type. Then
the differential graded algebra which is the real dual of BD H is precisely a differential
graded algebra of the kind
b ∂ [H∗ (X)]
Ω

where ∂ is the algebra differential dual to the coalgebra differential D. Thus the twisting
cochain τ then appears as an element of the differential graded algebra

endowed with the total differential

19

The twisting cochain property says that τ satisfies the master equation (5.3). The formulas
(7.3) and (7.4) are then essentially the same as those used by Chen to establish the
existence of the formal power series connection and of the differential ∂ in the proof of
his Theorem 1.3.1 in [7].

Homological perturbations and algebraic structure

In the 1980’s, I noticed that various standard HPT-constructions are compatible with
algebraic structure, and I used this observation to exploit A∞ -structures arising in group
cohomology via HPT-constructions of suitable small free resolutions. These small free
resolutions enabled me to do explicit numerical calculations in group cohomology which
until today are still not doable by other methods. In particular, spectral sequences show
up which do not collapse from E2 . This illustrates a typical phenomenon: Whenever a
spectral sequence arises from a certain mathematical structure, a certain strong homotopy
structure is lurking behind and the spectral sequence is an invariant thereof. The higher
homotopy structure is actually finer than the spectral sequence itself. The results have
been published in the papers [25]–[30].
The observation that compatibility with algebraic structure is hidden in various standard HPT-constructions led to an alternate approach to Theorem 6.1 and Theorem 7.1
and, indeed, leads to considerable generalization, cf. Remark 10.3 below. In the academic
year 1987/88, lifting of the restrictions in the USSR enabled T. Kadeishvili to accept an
invitation to the mathematics department of the University of Heidelberg. During that
period, in collaboration, T. Kadeishvili and I developed HPT for general chain equivalences and, within this research collaboration, we worked out in particular the alternate
approach. This kind of approach was also worked out in [14]–[16].
We will now explain the outcome of this alternate approach and how it actually leads
to proofs of these theorems and to additional insight. To this end, let

constitute a new filtered contraction that is natural in terms of the given data.
Proof. See [3] or [12].

The issue addressed in the perturbation lemma has been described in the literature
as a transference problem. The ordinary perturbation lemma solves this transference
problem relative merely to a perturbation of the differential on the larger object N. We
will now explore the transference problem relative to additional structure.
Let T[N] and T[M] be the differential graded tensor algebras on N and M respectively,
denote the multiplication map of T[N] by m, let Tπ and T∇ be the induced morphisms
of differential graded algebras, and define an operator Th : T[N] → T[N] by means of
(Th|N ⊗k ) = h ⊗ (∇π)⊗(k−1) + Id ⊗ h ⊗ (∇π)⊗(k−2) + · · · + Id⊗(k−1) ⊗ h,

k ≥ 1.

This is an instance of what is referred to as the tensor trick , developed in [24] and exploited
in [16], [24], [25], [26], [37] and elsewhere; cf. also §3 of [15]. We will come back to the
tensor trick in Section 11 below.
With the above preparations out of the way, the morphisms m, Tπ, Th, etc. are
related by the identities
m(Id ⊗ Th + Th ⊗ (T∇)(Tπ)) = (Th) m,
and
D(Th)(= d(Th) + (Th)d) = (T∇)(Tπ) − Id,
that is, Th is a homotopy Id ≃ (T∇)(Tπ) of morphisms of differential graded algebras,
whence the data



constitute a contraction of augmented algebras. Further, with respect to the augmentation filtrations on T[N] and T[M], these data constitute in fact a contraction of filtered
algebras. This idea goes back to Theorem 12.1 in Eilenberg and Mac Lane I [9]
where it is spelled out in the dual situation as a contraction of bar constructions. The
contraction of coalgebras that corresponds to (9.7) is also spelled out in [14] (3.2), in [15]
(§3), and in [16] (2.2).
Given a chain complex X and a multiplicative perturbation ∂ of the algebra differential
on T[X], we shall denote the new differential graded algebra by T∂ [X]. Maintaining
terminology introduced in [37], we shall refer to a chain complex X (without any additional
structure) as being connected in the reduced sense provided it is zero in degree zero and,
furthermore, either non-negative or non-positive; the reader will note that “connected in
the reduced sense” does not coincide with the standard usage of the term “connected”.
On the other hand, an augmented differential graded algebra is connected in the usual
21

sense if and only its augmentation ideal is, as a chain complex, connected in the reduced
sense.
Henceforth a tensor algebra T[W ] on a graded R-module W will always be viewed
as a filtered algebra with respect to the augmentation filtration. Here is Theorem 2.2∗ of
[37].
Theorem 9.2. Suppose that T[N] and T[M] are connected and let ∂ be a multiplicative
perturbation of the differential on T[N] with respect to the augmentation filtration. Then
the perturbation D given by (9.2) together with the morphisms given by (9.3) – (9.5) yield
a contraction

Plainly the perturbation D on T[M] and the morphisms T∂ ∇, T∂ π, T∂ h are determined by their restrictions to N ⊆ T[N] and M ⊆ T[M] as appropriate.
The proof of Theorem 9.2 given in [37] relies on the Algebra Perturbation Lemma
([37] Lemma 2.1∗ ) and involves the “tensor trick”.
We will now sketch a proof of Theorem 6.1. Let C be a coaugmented differential
graded coalgebra, with structure maps ∆ and η, and let
ΩC = T∂ [s−1 (JC)]
be its cobar construction, ∂ being the derivation on the differential graded tensor algebra
T[s−1 (JC)] induced by the diagonal map of C. Thus with respect to the augmentation
filtration, T[s−1 (JC)] is a filtered differential graded algebra, ∂ is a multiplicative perturbation, and the cobar construction ΩC appears as a “perturbation” of T[s−1 (JC)].
Suppose momentarily that C is simply connected or concentrated in non-positive
degrees. Then N = s−1 (JC) is connected in the reduced sense, and the algebra T[s−1 (JC)]
is complete. The contraction (6.1) determines a contraction

A closer look reveals that τ and D actually coincide with (6.8) and (6.9), respectively.
This establishes the statement of Complement 2 to Theorem 6.1 and yields, furthermore,
22

explicit morphisms which then can be extended, by suitable HPT-constructions, to A∞ morphisms between C and M (with its A∞ -coalgebra structure) and thus establish an
A∞ -equivalence between C and M.
To establish Theorem 6.1 for a general coaugmented differential graded coalgebra C,
we note that the contraction (9.7) of filtered algebras induces a contraction

General A∞ -algebras and A∞ -coalgebras

The reasoning in the previous section extends immediately to general A∞ -algebras and
A∞ -coalgebras and thus yields solutions of the corresponding transference problems:
Let A be an augmented A∞ -algebra, the A∞ -algebra structure being given by a coalgebra perturbation ∂ of the differential on Tc [sIA] relative to the coaugmentation filtration
and, as before, write B∂ A for the perturbed differential graded coalgebra. Moreover, let

Remark 10.3. At the risk of making a mountain out of a molehill we point out that
Theorem 10.1 is more general than Theorem 7.1 since, in Theorem 10.1, A is a general
(augmented) A∞ -algebra; likewise, Theorem 10.2 is more general than Theorem 6.1 since,
in Theorem 10.2, C is a general (coaugmented) A∞ -coalgebra. In other words, Theorem 10.1 provides a solution of the transference problem for A∞ -algebra structures and
Theorem 10.2 provides a solution of the transference problem for A∞ -coalgebra structures.

Summation over oriented rooted planar trees

In [48] it has been observed that A∞ -algebra structures of the kind reproduced in previous
sections can be described in terms of sums over oriented rooted planar trees endowed with
suitable labels. Indeed the authors of [48] bravely acknowledged that the oriented rooted
24

planar trees description is essentially a reworking of the earlier HPT-constructions. We
will now explain how these sums over oriented rooted planar trees come out of the HPTconstructions.
We return to the circumstances of Theorem 7.1 above. We denote the multiplication
map of A by µ : A ⊗ A → A.
By construction, the operation m2 : M ⊗ M → M is the composite
µ

∇⊗∇

π

M ⊗ M −−−→ A ⊗ A −−−→ A −−−→ M.
This is interpreted as an oriented rooted planar tree with three edges and four vertices,
one vertex where the three edges meet and an end point vertex for each edge. The vertex
where three edges meet is labelled µ, the root vertex is labelled π, and the two remaining
vertices are labelled ∇. The two edges having a vertex labelled ∇ are oriented from ∇ to
µ whereas the edge having µ and π as vertices is oriented from µ to π.
For j ≥ 1, simply by construction, the homogeneous degree j − 1 operation
mj+1 = s−1 ◦ D j ◦ s⊗(j+1) : (IM)⊗(j+1) −→ IM
is given by
π ◦ (τ 1 ∪ τ j + · · · + τ j ∪ τ 1 ) ◦ s⊗(j+1)
and is thus the sum of the j terms π ◦ (τ ℓ ∪ τ j+1−ℓ ) ◦ s⊗(j+1) where 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ j. Each of
these j terms can be represented by an oriented rooted planar tree with suitable labels,
in the following way:
The operation m2 has already been dealt with. The operation m3 : M ⊗3 → M is the
sum of the two composite morphisms
∇⊗3

A⊗µ

A⊗h

µ

π

∇⊗3

µ⊗A

h⊗A

µ

π

M ⊗ M ⊗ M −−−→ A ⊗ A ⊗ A −−−→ A ⊗ A −−−→ A ⊗ A −−−→ A −−−→ M
and
M ⊗ M ⊗ M −−−→ A ⊗ A ⊗ A −−−→ A ⊗ A −−−→ A ⊗ A −−−→ A −−−→ M.
Each of them is interpreted as an oriented rooted planar tree with four external edges, one
internal edge, four external vertices, and two internal vertices in the following manner:
(i) Three external vertices are labelled ∇; these correspond to the three tensor factors ∇
in the above constituent
∇⊗3 : M ⊗ M ⊗ M −→ A ⊗ A ⊗ A;
(ii) one external vertex—the root vertex—is labelled π; this corresponds to the right-most
arrow π : A → M;
(iii) the two internal vertices are labelled µ; in the upper morphism, these correspond to
the arrows labelled µ : A⊗A → A and A⊗µ : A⊗A⊗A → A⊗A; in the lower morphism,
they correspond to the arrows labelled µ : A ⊗ A → A and µ ⊗ A : A ⊗ A ⊗ A → A ⊗ A;
(iv) the single internal edge is labelled h; this corresponds to the arrow labelled
A ⊗ h : A ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ A
25

in the upper morphism and labelled
h ⊗ A : A ⊗ A −→ A ⊗ A
in the lower morphism;
(v) the three external edges having ∇ as a vertex are oriented from the vertices labelled
∇ to the vertices labelled µ;
(vi) the remaining external edge is oriented from a vertex labelled µ to the root vertex
labelled π;
(vii) two edges having a vertex labelled ∇ as starting point meet at a vertex labelled µ,
this vertex is joined to the other vertex labelled µ, oriented in that manner, and it meets
the third edge having a vertex labelled ∇ as starting point at its end point.
There are two such oriented rooted planar trees, one being the mirror image of the other,
and the two composite morphisms spelled out above correspond to these two labelled
oriented rooted planar trees.
Likewise the operation m4 : M ⊗4 → M is the sum of three composite morphisms
of a similar nature which, in the language of twisting cochains, arise from the three
constituents τ 1 ∪ τ 3 , τ 2 ∪ τ 2 , and τ 3 ∪ τ 1 , cf. (7.4) above; each such composite morphisms
can be encoded in the appropriate labelled oriented rooted planar tree.
Formalizing this procedure one arrives at the description of the operations mj in terms
of sums over labelled oriented rooted planar trees worked out in detail in [48].
The requisite combinatorics for the construction in Theorem 7.1 is provided by the
concept of cofree coalgebra; likewise in Theorem 6.1 the necessary combinatorics is provided by the concept of free algebra. The machinery of labelled oriented rooted planar
trees yield an alternate description of the requisite combinatorial tool.
This discussion so far refers to ordinary strict algebra (or coalgebra) structures on the
larger object coming into play in the corresponding contraction. Instead of the original
contraction (7.1) where the constituent A is an ordinary augmented differential graded
algebra, consider now a contraction of the kind (10.1) where A is merely an A∞ -algebra,
with structure maps
µj : A⊗j −→ A (j ≥ 1).
The construction in [48] in terms of labelled oriented rooted planar trees extends to that
situation. Indeed, define the arity of a vertex to be the number of incoming edges. To
the trees described above having only vertices of arity 2, one simply adds trees where
internal vertices v have general arities j > 2, a vertex of arity j > 2 being labelled by the
operation µj ; one then takes the sum over all labelled oriented rooted planar trees. This
kind of construction yields an A∞ -algebra structure on M and, extended suitably, it also
yields an A∞ -equivalence between A and M.
However, unravelling the perturbation D on Tc [sIM] spelled out in Theorem 10.1, we
find precisely that very same A∞ -structure as that given by the labelled oriented rooted
planar trees. Indeed, the infinite series (9.2), evaluated relative to the contraction (9.11),
takes the form
D = (Tc π)∂(Tc ∇) − (Tc π)∂(Tc h)∂(Tc ∇) + (Tc π)∂(Tc h)∂(Tc h)∂(Tc ∇) + . . . .

(11.1)

Now, when ∂ arises from an ordinary associative differential graded algebra structure on
A, the first term in the development (11.1) yields, on M, the A∞ -constituent m2 , the
26

second term yields the A∞ -constituent m3 , and so forth, precisely in the form given by
the labelled oriented rooted planar trees construction. More general, when ∂ arises from
a general A∞ -algebra structure {µj }j on A, the perturbation ∂ on Tc [sIA] has the form
∂ = ∂1 + ∂2 + . . .
in such a way that, for j ≥ 1, the constituent ∂ j corresponds to µj+1 . Consequently each
term in the development (11.1) involves all the constituents µj , and reordering the terms
that show up in (11.1), we obtain precisely the A∞ -constituent mj in the form given by
the labelled oriented rooted planar trees construction for the transference of a general
A∞ -algebra structure. Likewise, exploiting the series (9.3), (9.4), and (9.5) to unravel
the other terms, respectively, Tc∂ ∇, Tc∂ π, and Tc∂ h that are spelled out in Theorem 10.1,
we obtain the requisite remaining data that establish the necessary chain equivalence,
precisely in the form given by the corresponding labelled oriented rooted planar trees
constructions for the transference of a general A∞ -algebra structure.
The same kind of remark applies to the dual situation encapsulated in Theorem 10.2.
The construction of these perturbations D on the tensor algebra or tensor coalgebra relies
on the tensor trick mentioned above, which we developed in [24].
Thus we see that the more recent constructions of an A∞ -structure in [48] (6.4) and
[50] still come down to the earlier constructions.
Remark 11.1. The construction in [50] is slightly more general in the sense that the
initial data considered there are required to satisfy requirements somewhat weaker than
those which characterize an ordinary contraction. Indeed, in [50], a system


of chain complexes is explored satisfying the requirements (2.4) and (2.5) but not necessarily (2.3), that is, it is not required that π∇ = Id; indeed, no condition is imposed upon
π∇. We will now show that application of the constructions in the perturbation lemma
without the requirement that π∇ = Id does not lead to a more general theory.
Indeed, a system of the kind (11.2) can arise by the following specific construction
from an ordinary contraction and in fact every system of the kind (11.2) arises in this
way: Consider an ordinary contraction

27

(11.4)

is a system of the kind (11.2). We will now show that every system of the kind (11.2) arises
in this way. Given a perturbation of the differential on M, application of the perturbation
lemma involves only the summand N1 of N and leaves N2 unchanged in the sense that
this application yields a new system of the kind (11.4) where the new contraction of the
kind (11.3) arises by an application of the perturbation lemma to the contraction of the
kind (11.3) before application of the perturbation and where the summand N2 remains
unchanged. Hence application of the constructions in the perturbation lemma without the
requirement that π∇ = Id does not lead to a more general theory.
Thus consider a system of the kind (11.2). The requirement (2.4), viz.
Dh = Id − ∇π,
implies
D(πh∇) = π∇ − π∇π∇
which, in view of the annihilation properties (2.5), comes down to π∇ = π∇π∇. Hence
the endomorphism π∇ of N is a projector. Let N1 = π∇(N) and N2 = (Id − π∇)(N).
Then N = N1 ⊕ N2 . Let π1 : M → N1 be the composite of π with the canonical projection
to N1 , and let ∇1 : N1 → M be the injection of N1 into N, followed by ∇. The resulting
data


∇1
−

→
(11.5)
N1 ←−−− M, h
π1

constitute a contraction of chain complexes.
Indeed, to understand the situation, suppose momentarily that N1 is zero, that is,
the composite π∇ is zero. Then ∇π = ∇π∇π = 0 whence Dh = Id, that is, M is
contractible, the homotopy h being a conical contracting homotopy. In the general case
where N1 is not necessarily zero, let M1 = ∇(N1 ) and M2 = ker(π). The requirement
(2.4), viz. Dh = Id − ∇π, together with the annihilation properties (2.5), implies that
M = ker(π) + ∇π(M) = ker(π) + ∇(N) = ker(π) + ∇(N1 ) + ∇(N2 ).
But π∇(N2 ) is zero whence ∇(N2 ) ⊆ ker(π) and thence
M = ker(π) + ∇(N1 ) = M1 + ker(π) = M1 + M2 .

By construction, π restricted to M2 is zero and π restricted to M1 amounts to the restriction of π1 to M1 which, in turn is an isomorphism having ∇1 as its inverse. Moreover,
exploiting once more the fact that π∇(N2 ) is zero we conclude that ∇ restricted to N2
is a morphism of the kind ∇2 : N2 → M2 . Hence the decomposition M = M1 + M2 is
a direct sum decomposition; the obvious inclusion ker(π1 ) ⊆ ker(π) is the identity; the
original system (11.2) can be written as

and the annihilation properties (2.5) imply that h(M1 ) is zero and that h(M2 ) ⊆ M2 .
Indeed, since h∇ is zero, h vanishes on M1 and, likewise, since πh is zero, h(M2 ) ⊆ M2 .

Perturbations for Lie algebras and L∞ -algebras,

let
∇
−
→
(12.1)
(M −

−
− g, h)
π

be a contraction of chain complexes. Suppose that the cofree coaugmented differential
graded cocommutative coalgebra Sc [sg] on the suspension sg of g and, likewise, the cofree
coaugmented differential graded cocommutative coalgebra Sc = Sc [sM] on the suspension
sM of M exist. This kind of coalgebra is well known to be cocomplete. Further, let
d0 : Sc −→ Sc denote the coalgebra differential on Sc = Sc [sM] induced by the differential
on M. For b ≥ 0, we will henceforth denote the homogeneous degree b component of
Sc [sM] by Scb ; thus, as a chain complex, Fb Sc = R ⊕ Sc1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Scb . Likewise, as a chain
c
complex, Sc = ⊕∞
j=0 Sj . We denote by
τM : Sc −→ M
the composite of the canonical projection proj : Sc → sM from Sc = Sc [sM] to its homogeneous degree 1 constituent sM with the desuspension map s−1 from sM to M. When
M is viewed as an abelian differential graded Lie algebra, Sc = Sc [sM] may be viewed
as the CCE or classifying coalgebra C[M] for M, and τM : Sc → M is then the universal
differential graded Lie algebra twisting cochain for M.
Let
τ 1 = ∇τM : Sc → g
(12.2)
and, for j ≥ 2, let
τ j : Sc → g
29

be the degree −1 morphism defined recursively by
τ j = 12 h([τ 1 , τ j−1 ] + · · · + [τ j−1 , τ 1 ]) : Sc → g.

(12.3)

Thereafter, for j ≥ 1, define the degree −1 coderivation D j on Sc by
τM D j = 12 π([τ 1 , τ j ] + · · · + [τ j , τ 1 ]) : Scj+1 → M.

(12.4)

In particular, for j ≥ 1, the coderivation D j is zero on Fj Sc and lowers coaugmentation
filtration by j.
We now spell out the main result of [31].
Theorem 12.1. The infinite series
D = D 1 + D 2 + . . . : Sc → Sc

(12.5)

is a coalgebra perturbation of the differential d on Sc induced from the differential on M,
and the infinite series
τ = τ 1 + τ 2 + . . . : Sc → g
(12.6)
is a Lie algebra twisting cochain
(Sc , d + D) −→ g.
Furthermore, the adjoint
τ : (Sc , d + D) −→ Cg
of the twisting cochain τ , necessarily a morphism of differential graded coalgebras, is a
chain equivalence. More precisely, the data determine a contraction


τ

(S [sM], d + D) ←−−− C[g], H
Π

of chain complexes which is natural in terms of the data.
This is precisely Theorem 2.1 in [31] where also a complete proof can be found. For
the special case where M is the homology of g, this result yields the “minimality theorem”
for ordinary differential graded Lie algebras.
Remark 12.2. The attempt to treat, as for the cases explained in Section 9 above, the
requisite higher homotopies by means of a suitable version of the perturbation lemma relative to the additional algebraic structure, that is, to develop a version of the perturbation
lemma compatible with Lie brackets or more generally with sh-Lie structures, led to the
paper [38], but technical complications arise since the tensor trick breaks down for cocommutative coalgebras; indeed, the notion of homotopy of morphisms of cocommutative
coalgebras is a subtle concept [58], and only a special case was handled in [38], with some
of the technical details merely sketched. The article [31] provides a complete solution with
all the necessary details and handles the case of a general contraction whereas in [38] only
the case of a contraction of a differential graded Lie algebra onto its homology was treated.
Also in [38], the proof is only sketched, and a detailed proof is given in [31]. The twisting
cochain τ is the most general solution of the master equation, under the circumstances of
[31].
30

We will write
CD M = (Sc , d + D).

(12.7)

The piece of structure D in CD M is precisely an L∞ -algebra structure on M, Theorem
12.1 includes the statement that M, endowed with the L∞ -algebra structure D, and g,
endowed with the L∞ -algebra structure associated with the differential graded Lie algebra
structure, are, via τ , equivalent as L∞ -algebras.
The general sh-Lie algebra perturbation lemma, Theorem 2.5 in [34], extends Theorem
12.1 to the more general case where the constituent g in the contraction (12.1) is merely
an sh-Lie algebra. This sh-Lie algebra perturbation lemma yields, in particular, the
“minimality theorem” for general L∞ -algebras.

More about the relationship with deformations

We have pointed out above that the idea of combining the Gerstenhaber operation in the
Hochschild complex mentioned in Section 4.1 with Stasheff’s notion of A∞ -algebra let
Kadeishvili to the minimality theorem. There is an obvious formal relationship between
homological perturbations and deformation theory but the relationship is actually much
more profound: In [23], S. Halperin and J. Stasheff developed a procedure by means of
which the classification of rational homotopy equivalences inducing a fixed cohomology
algebra isomorphism can be achieved. Moreover, one can explore the rational homotopy
types with a fixed cohomology algebra by studying perturbations of a free differential
graded commutative model by means of techniques from deformation theory. This was
initiated by M. Schlessinger and J. Stasheff [58]. A related and independent development, phrased in terms of what is called the functor D, is due to N. Berikashvili and his
students at Georgia, notably T. Kadeishvili and S. Saneblidze; see [29] for some details
and references. A third approach in which only the underlying graded vector space was
fixed is due to Y. Felix [10]. More remarks about the relationship between homological
perturbations and deformation theory can be found in [32].
Kadeishvili contributed once more to the relationship between deformations and
higher homotopies: He observed an interpretation of A∞ -operations in terms of a suitable
notion of twisting cochain, with respect to the Gerstenhaber operation in the Hochschild
(cochain) complex [43]. An expanded version of that approach will appear as [45].
