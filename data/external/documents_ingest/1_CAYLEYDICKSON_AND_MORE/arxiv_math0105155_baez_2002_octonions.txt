                                             1    Introduction
                                             There are exactly four normed division algebras: the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C),
                                             quaternions (H), and octonions (O). The real numbers are the dependable breadwinner of the
                                             family, the complete ordered field we all rely on. The complex numbers are a slightly flashier but
                                             still respectable younger brother: not ordered, but algebraically complete. The quaternions, being
                                             noncommutative, are the eccentric cousin who is shunned at important family gatherings. But the
                                             octonions are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic: they are nonassociative.
                                                  Most mathematicians have heard the story of how Hamilton invented the quaternions. In 1835, at
                                             the age of 30, he had discovered how to treat complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. Fascinated
                                             by the relation between C and 2-dimensional geometry, he tried for many years to invent a bigger
                                             algebra that would play a similar role in 3-dimensional geometry. In modern language, it seems he
                                             was looking for a 3-dimensional normed division algebra. His quest built to its climax in October
                                             1843. He later wrote to his son, “Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month, on my
                                             coming down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used to ask me:
                                             ‘Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?’ Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of
                                             the head: ‘No, I can only add and subtract them’.” The problem, of course, was that there exists
                                             no 3-dimensional normed division algebra. He really needed a 4-dimensional algebra.
                                                  Finally, on the 16th of October, 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal to a
                                             meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, he made his momentous discovery. “That is to say,
                                             I then and there felt the galvanic circuit of thought close; and the sparks which fell from it were the
                                             fundamental equations between i, j, k; exactly such as I have used them ever since.” And in a famous
                                             act of mathematical vandalism, he carved these equations into the stone of the Brougham Bridge:

                                                                                    i2 = j 2 = k 2 = ijk = −1.

                                                 One reason this story is so well-known is that Hamilton spent the rest of his life obsessed with
                                             the quaternions and their applications to geometry [45, 53]. And for a while, quaternions were
                                             fashionable. They were made a mandatory examination topic in Dublin, and in some American
                                             universities they were the only advanced mathematics taught. Much of what we now do with scalars
                                             and vectors in R3 was then done using real and imaginary quaternions. A school of ‘quaternionists’
                                             developed, which was led after Hamilton’s death by Peter Tait of Edinburgh and Benjamin Peirce of
                                             Harvard. Tait wrote 8 books on the quaternions, emphasizing their applications to physics. When
                                             Gibbs invented the modern notation for the dot product and cross product, Tait condemned it as a
                                             “hermaphrodite monstrosity”. A war of polemics ensued, with such luminaries as Heaviside weighing


                                                                                                 1
in on the side of vectors. Ultimately the quaternions lost, and acquired a slight taint of disgrace
from which they have never fully recovered [27].
    Less well-known is the discovery of the octonions by Hamilton’s friend from college, John T.
Graves. It was Graves’ interest in algebra that got Hamilton thinking about complex numbers
and triplets in the first place. The very day after his fateful walk, Hamilton sent an 8-page letter
describing the quaternions to Graves. Graves replied on October 26th, complimenting Hamilton on
the boldness of the idea, but adding “There is still something in the system which gravels me. I have
not yet any clear views as to the extent to which we are at liberty arbitrarily to create imaginaries,
and to endow them with supernatural properties.” And he asked: “If with your alchemy you can
make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?”
    Graves then set to work on some gold of his own! On December 26th, he wrote to Hamilton
describing a new 8-dimensional algebra, which he called the ‘octaves’. He showed that they were a
normed division algebra, and used this to express the product of two sums of eight perfect squares
as another sum of eight perfect squares: the ‘eight squares theorem’ [52].
    In January 1844, Graves sent three letters to Hamilton expanding on his discovery. He considered
the idea of a general theory of ‘2m -ions’, and tried to construct a 16-dimensional normed division
algebra, but he “met with an unexpected hitch” and came to doubt that this was possible. Hamilton
offered to publicize Graves’ discovery, but being busy with work on quaternions, he kept putting it
off. In July he wrote to Graves pointing out that the octonions were nonassociative: “A · BC =
AB · C = ABC, if A, B, C be quaternions, but not so, generally, with your octaves.” In fact,
Hamilton first invented the term ‘associative’ at about this time, so the octonions may have played
a role in clarifying the importance of this concept.
    Meanwhile the young Arthur Cayley, fresh out of Cambridge, had been thinking about the
quaternions ever since Hamilton announced their existence. He seemed to be seeking relationships
between the quaternions and hyperelliptic functions. In March of 1845, he published a paper in the
Philosophical Magazine entitled ‘On Jacobi’s Elliptic Functions, in Reply to the Rev. B. Bronwin;
and on Quaternions’ [18]. The bulk of this paper was an attempt to rebut an article pointing out
mistakes in Cayley’s work on elliptic functions. Apparently as an afterthought, he tacked on a brief
description of the octonions. In fact, this paper was so full of errors that it was omitted from his
collected works — except for the part about octonions [19].
    Upset at being beaten to publication, Graves attached a postscript to a paper of his own which
was to appear in the following issue of the same journal, saying that he had known of the octonions
ever since Christmas, 1843. On June 14th, 1847, Hamilton contributed a short note to the Transac-
tions of the Royal Irish Academy, vouching for Graves’ priority. But it was too late: the octonions
became known as ‘Cayley numbers’. Still worse, Graves later found that his eight squares theorem
had already been discovered by C. F. Degen in 1818 [28, 30].
    Why have the octonions languished in such obscurity compared to the quaternions? Besides
their rather inglorious birth, one reason is that they lacked a tireless defender such as Hamilton.
But surely the reason for this is that they lacked any clear application to geometry and physics.
The unit quaternions form the group SU(2), which is the double cover of the rotation group SO(3).
This makes them nicely suited to the study of rotations and angular momentum, particularly in
the context of quantum mechanics. These days we regard this phenomenon as a special case of the
theory of Clifford algebras. Most of us no longer attribute to the quaternions the cosmic significance
that Hamilton claimed for them, but they fit nicely into our understanding of the scheme of things.
    The octonions, on the other hand, do not. Their relevance to geometry was quite obscure
until 1925, when Élie Cartan described ‘triality’ — the symmetry between vectors and spinors in 8-
dimensional Euclidean space [17]. Their potential relevance to physics was noticed in a 1934 paper by
Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner on the foundations of quantum mechanics [59]. However, attempts
by Jordan and others to apply octonionic quantum mechanics to nuclear and particle physics met
with little success. Work along these lines continued quite slowly until the 1980s, when it was
realized that the octonions explain some curious features of string theory [65]. The Lagrangian for



                                                  2
the classical superstring involves a relationship between vectors and spinors in Minkowski spacetime
which holds only in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions. Note that these numbers are 2 more than the
dimensions of R, C, H and O. As we shall see, this is no coincidence: briefly, the isomorphisms

                                         sl(2, R)   ∼
                                                    =   so(2, 1)
                                         sl(2, C)   ∼
                                                    =   so(3, 1)
                                         sl(2, H)   ∼
                                                    =   so(5, 1)
                                         sl(2, O)   ∼
                                                    =   so(9, 1)

allow us to treat a spinor in one of these dimensions as a pair of elements of the corresponding division
algebra. It is fascinating that of these superstring Lagrangians, it is the 10-dimensional octonionic
one that gives the most promising candidate for a realistic theory of fundamental physics! However,
there is still no proof that the octonions are useful for understanding the real world. We can only
hope that eventually this question will be settled one way or another.
    Besides their possible role in physics, the octonions are important because they tie together
some algebraic structures that otherwise appear as isolated and inexplicable exceptions. As we
shall explain, the concept of an octonionic projective space OPn only makes sense for n ≤ 2, due
to the nonassociativity of O. This means that various structures associated to real, complex and
quaternionic projective spaces have octonionic analogues only for n ≤ 2.
    Simple Lie algebras are a nice example of this phenomenon. There are 3 infinite families of
‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, which come from the isometry groups of the projective spaces RPn ,
CPn and HPn . There are also 5 ‘exceptional’ simple Lie algebras. These were discovered by Killing
and Cartan in the late 1800s. At the time, the significance of these exceptions was shrouded in
mystery: they did not arise as symmetry groups of known structures. Only later did their connection
to the octonions become clear. It turns out that 4 of them come from the isometry groups of the
projective planes over O, O ⊗ C, O ⊗ H and O ⊗ O. The remaining one is the automorphism group
of the octonions!
    Another good example is the classification of simple formally real Jordan algebras. Besides
several infinite families of these, there is the ‘exceptional’ Jordan algebra, which consists of 3 × 3
hermitian octonionic matrices. Minimal projections in this Jordan algebra correspond to points of
OP2 , and the automorphism group of this algebra is the same as the isometry group of OP2 .
    The octonions also have fascinating connections to topology. In 1957, Raoul Bott computed
the homotopy groups of the topological group O(∞), which is the inductive limit of the orthogonal
groups O(n) as n → ∞. He proved that they repeat with period 8:

                                       πi+8 (O(∞)) ∼
                                                   = πi (O(∞)).

This is known as ‘Bott periodicity’. He also computed the first 8:

                                          π0 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   Z2
                                          π1 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   Z2
                                          π2 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   0
                                          π3 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   Z
                                          π4 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   0
                                          π5 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   0
                                          π6 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   0
                                          π7 (O(∞))     ∼
                                                        =   Z

Note that the nonvanishing homotopy groups here occur in dimensions one less than the dimensions
of R, C, H, and O. This is no coincidence! In a normed division algebra, left multiplication by an
element of norm one defines an orthogonal transformation of the algebra, and thus an element of


                                                    3
O(∞). This gives us maps from the spheres S 0 , S 1 , S 3 and S 7 to O(∞), and these maps generate
the homotopy groups in those dimensions.
    Given this, one might naturally guess that the period-8 repetition in the homotopy groups of
O(∞) is in some sense ‘caused’ by the octonions. As we shall see, this is true. Conversely, Bott
periodicity is closely connected to the problem of how many pointwise linearly independent smooth
vector fields can be found on the n-sphere [56]. There exist n such vector fields only when n + 1 =
1, 2, 4, or 8, and this can be used to show that division algebras over the reals can only occur in
these dimensions.
    In what follows we shall try to explain the octonions and their role in algebra, geometry, and
topology. In Section 2 we give four constructions of the octonions: first via their multiplication
table, then using the Fano plane, then using the Cayley–Dickson construction and finally using
Clifford algebras, spinors, and a generalized concept of ‘triality’ advocated by Frank Adams [2].
Each approach has its own merits. In Section 3 we discuss the projective lines and planes over
the normed division algebras — especially O — and describe their relation to Bott periodicity, the
exceptional Jordan algebra, and the Lie algebra isomorphisms listed above. Finally, in Section 4 we
discuss octonionic constructions of the exceptional Lie groups, especially the ‘magic square’.

1.1    Preliminaries
Before our tour begins, let us settle on some definitions. For us a vector space will always be a
finite-dimensional module over the field of real numbers. An algebra A will be a vector space that
is equipped with a bilinear map m: A × A → A called ‘multiplication’ and a nonzero element 1 ∈ A
called the ‘unit’ such that m(1, a) = m(a, 1) = a. As usual, we abbreviate m(a, b) as ab. We do
not assume our algebras are associative! Given an algebra, we will freely think of real numbers as
elements of this algebra via the map α 7→ α1.
     An algebra A is a division algebra if given a, b ∈ A with ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.
Equivalently, A is a division algebra if the operations of left and right multiplication by any nonzero
element are invertible. A normed division algebra is an algebra A that is also a normed vector
space with kabk = kakkbk. This implies that A is a division algebra and that k1k = 1.
     We should warn the reader of some subtleties. We say an algebra A has multiplicative inverses
if for any nonzero a ∈ A there is an element a−1 ∈ A with aa−1 = a−1 a = 1. An associative algebra
has multiplicative inverses iff it is a division algebra. However, this fails for nonassociative algebras!
In Section 2.2 we shall construct algebras that have multiplicative inverses, but are not division
algebras. On the other hand, we can construct a division algebra without multiplicative inverses
by taking the quaternions and modifying the product slightly, setting i2 = −1 + ǫj for some small
nonzero real number ǫ while leaving the rest of the multiplication table unchanged. The element
i then has both right and left inverses, but they are not equal. (We thank David Rusin for this
example.)
     There are three levels of associativity. An algebra is power-associative if the subalgebra gen-
erated by any one element is associative. It is alternative if the subalgebra generated by any two
elements is associative. Finally, if the subalgebra generated by any three elements is associative, the
algebra is associative.
     As we shall see, the octonions are not associative, but they are alternative. How does one check
a thing like this? By a theorem of Emil Artin [84], an algebra A is alternative iff for all a, b ∈ A we
have

                       (aa)b = a(ab),      (ab)a = a(ba),        (ba)a = b(aa)                        (1)

In fact, any two of these equations implies the remaining one, so people usually take the first and
last as the definition of ‘alternative’. To see this fact, note that any algebra has a trilinear map

                                             [·, ·, ·]: A3 → A

                                           [a, b, c] = (ab)c − a(bc).
The associator measures the failure of associativity just as the commutator [a, b] = ab − ba measures
the failure of commutativity. Now, the commutator is an alternating bilinear map, meaning that it
switches sign whenever the two arguments are exchanged:

                                                [a, b] = −[b, a]

or equivalently, that it vanishes when they are equal:

                                                  [a, a] = 0.

This raises the question of whether the associator is alternating too. In fact, this holds precisely
when A is alternative! The reason is that each equation in (1) says that the associator vanishes
when a certain pair of arguments are equal, or equivalently, that it changes sign when that pair of
arguments is switched. Note, however, that if the associator changes sign when we switch the ith
and jth arguments, and also when we switch the jth and kth arguments, it must change sign when
we switch the ith and kth. Thus any two of equations (1) imply the third.
   Now we can say what is so great about R, C, H, and O:

Theorem 1. R, C, H, and O are the only normed division algebras.


Theorem 2. R, C, H, and O are the only alternative division algebras.

   The first theorem goes back to an 1898 paper by Hurwitz [55]. It was subsequently generalized
in many directions, for example, to algebras over other fields. A version of the second theorem
appears in an 1930 paper by Zorn [100] — the guy with the lemma. For modern proofs of both these
theorems, see Schafer’s excellent book on nonassociative algebras [84]. We sketch a couple proofs of
Hurwitz’s theorem in Section 2.3.
   Note that we did not state that R, C, H and O are the only division algebras. This is not true.
For example, we have already described a way to get 4-dimensional division algebras that do not
have multiplicative inverses. However, we do have this fact:

Theorem 3. All division algebras have dimension 1, 2, 4, or 8.

This was independently proved by Kervaire [62] and Bott–Milnor [11] in 1958. We will say a bit
about the proof in Section 3.1. However, in what follows our main focus will not be on general
results about division algebras. Instead, we concentrate on special features of the octonions. Let us
begin by constructing them.


2     Constructing the Octonions
The most elementary way to construct the octonions is to give their multiplication table. The
octonions are an 8-dimensional algebra with basis 1, e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 , e6 , e7 , and their multiplication
is given in this table, which describes the result of multiplying the element in the ith row by the
element in the jth column:




                                                       5
                                      e1   e2        e3     e4   e5      e6     e7
                              e1     −1    e4        e7    −e2   e6     −e5    −e3
                              e2     −e4   −1        e5     e1   −e3     e7    −e6
                              e3     −e7   −e5      −1      e6   e2     −e4     e1
                              e4      e2   −e1      −e6    −1    e7      e3    −e5
                              e5     −e6   e3       −e2    −e7   −1      e1     e4
                              e6      e5   −e7       e4    −e3   −e1    −1      e2
                              e7      e3   e6       −e1     e5   −e4    −e2    −1


                                   Table 1 — Octonion Multiplication Table

Unfortunately, this table is almost completely unenlightening! About the only interesting things one
can easily learn from it are:
   • e1 , . . . , e7 are square roots of -1,
   • ei and ej anticommute when i 6= j:
                                                      ei ej = −ej ei

   • the index cycling identity holds:

                                           ei ej = ek =⇒ ei+1 ej+1 = ek+1

      where we think of the indices as living in Z7 , and
   • the index doubling identity holds:

                                               ei ej = ek =⇒ e2i e2j = e2k .

Together with a single nontrivial product like e1 e2 = e4 , these facts are enough to recover the whole
multiplication table. However, we really want a better way to remember the octonion product.
We should become as comfortable with multiplying octonions as we are with multiplying matrices!
And ultimately, we want a more conceptual approach to the octonions, which explains their special
properties and how they fit in with other mathematical ideas. In what follows, we give some more
descriptions of octonion multiplication, starting with a nice mnemonic, and working up to some
deeper, more conceptual ones.

2.1    The Fano plane
The quaternions, H, are a 4-dimensional algebra with basis 1, i, j, k. To describe the product we
could give a multiplication table, but it is easier to remember that:
   • 1 is the multiplicative identity,
   • i, j, and k are square roots of -1,
   • we have ij = k, ji = −k, and all identities obtained from these by cyclic permutations of
     (i, j, k).
We can summarize the last rule in a picture:




                                                          6
                                                                   i




                                                    k                             j



When we multiply two elements going clockwise around the circle we get the next one: for example,
ij = k. But when we multiply two going around counterclockwise, we get minus the next one: for
example, ji = −k.
   We can use the same sort of picture to remember how to multiply octonions:
                                                                  e6




                                                        e4                   e1

                                                                  e7



                                          e3                      ei2                      e5


This is the Fano plane, a little gadget with 7 points and 7 lines. The ‘lines’ are the sides of the
triangle, its altitudes, and the circle containing all the midpoints of the sides. Each pair of distinct
points lies on a unique line. Each line contains three points, and each of these triples has has a cyclic
ordering shown by the arrows. If ei , ej , and ek are cyclically ordered in this way then

                                          ei ej = ek ,                  ej ei = −ek .

Together with these rules:
   • 1 is the multiplicative identity,
   • e1 , . . . , e7 are square roots of -1,
the Fano plane completely describes the algebra structure of the octonions. Index-doubling corre-
sponds to rotating the picture a third of a turn.
    This is certainly a neat mnemonic, but is there anything deeper lurking behind it? Yes! The
Fano plane is the projective plane over the 2-element field Z2 . In other words, it consists of lines
through the origin in the vector space Z32 . Since every such line contains a single nonzero element,
we can also think of the Fano plane as consisting of the seven nonzero elements of Z32 . If we think
of the origin in Z32 as corresponding to 1 ∈ O, we get the following picture of the octonions:
                                                                        e6

                                               e4
                                                                                      e1

                                                             e7
                                                                        1

                                               e3
                                                                                      e5

                                                             e2




                                                                  7
Note that planes through the origin of this 3-dimensional vector space give subalgebras of O iso-
morphic to the quaternions, lines through the origin give subalgebras isomorphic to the complex
numbers, and the origin itself gives a subalgebra isomorphic to the real numbers.
   What we really have here is a description of the octonions as a ‘twisted group algebra’. Given
any group G, the group algebra R[G] consists of all finite formal linear combinations of elements of
G with real coefficients. This is an associative algebra with the product coming from that of G. We
can use any function
                                             α: G2 → {±1}
to ‘twist’ this product, defining a new product
                                       ⋆: R[G] × R[G] → R[G]
by:
                                          g ⋆ h = α(g, h) gh,
where g, h ∈ G ⊂ R[G]. One can figure out an equation involving α that guarantees this new product
will be associative. In this case we call α a ‘2-cocycle’. If α satisfies a certain extra equation, the
product ⋆ will also be commutative, and we call α a ‘stable 2-cocycle’. For example, the group
algebra R[Z2 ] is isomorphic to a product of 2 copies of R, but we can twist it by a stable 2-cocyle to
obtain the complex numbers. The group algebra R[Z22 ] is isomorphic to a product of 4 copies of R,
but we can twist it by a 2-cocycle to obtain the quaternions. Similarly, the group algebra R[Z32 ] is a
product of 8 copies of R, and what we have really done in this section is describe a function α that
allows us to twist this group algebra to obtain the octonions. Since the octonions are nonassociative,
this function is not a 2-cocycle. However, its coboundary is a ‘stable 3-cocycle’, which allows one
to define a new associator and braiding for the category of Z32 -graded vector spaces, making it
into a symmetric monoidal category [4]. In this symmetric monoidal category, the octonions are a
commutative monoid object. In less technical terms: this category provides a context in which the
octonions are commutative and associative! So far this idea has just begun to be exploited.

2.2    The Cayley–Dickson construction
It would be nice to have a construction of the normed division algebras R, C, H, O that explained
why each one fits neatly inside the next. It would be nice if this construction made it clear why H
is noncommutative and O is nonassociative. It would be even better if this construction gave an
infinite sequence of algebras, doubling in dimension each time, with the normed division algebras as
the first four. In fact, there is such a construction: it’s called the Cayley–Dickson construction.
    As Hamilton noted, the complex number a + bi can be thought of as a pair (a, b) of real numbers.
Addition is done component-wise, and multiplication goes like this:
                                   (a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db, ad + cb)
We can also define the conjugate of a complex number by
                                          (a, b)∗ = (a, −b).
   Now that we have the complex numbers, we can define the quaternions in a similar way. A
quaternion can be thought of as a pair of complex numbers. Addition is done component-wise, and
multiplication goes like this:
                                 (a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db∗ , a∗ d + cb)                       (2)
This is just like our formula for multiplication of complex numbers, but with a couple of conjugates
thrown in. If we included them in the previous formula nothing would change, since the conjugate
of a real number is just itself. We can also define the conjugate of a quaternion by
                                          (a, b)∗ = (a∗ , −b).                                     (3)


                                                   8
    The game continues! Now we can define an octonion to be a pair of quaternions. As before, we
add and multiply them using formulas (2) and (3). This trick for getting new algebras from old is
called the Cayley–Dickson construction.
    Why do the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions have multiplicative
inverses? I take it as obvious for the real numbers. For the complex numbers, one can check that

                                 (a, b)(a, b)∗ = (a, b)∗ (a, b) = k(1, 0)

where k is a real number, the square of the norm of (a, b). This means that whenever (a, b) is nonzero,
its multiplicative inverse is (a, b)∗ /k. One can check that the same holds for the quaternions and
octonions.
    But this, of course, raises the question: why isn’t there an infinite sequence of division algebras,
each one obtained from the preceding one by the Cayley–Dickson construction? The answer is that
each time we apply the construction, our algebra gets a bit worse. First we lose the fact that every
element is its own conjugate, then we lose commutativity, then we lose associativity, and finally we
lose the division algebra property.
    To see this clearly, it helps to be a bit more formal. Define a ∗-algebra to be an algebra A
equipped with a conjugation, that is, a real-linear map ∗: A → A with

                                      a∗∗ = a,       (ab)∗ = b∗ a∗

for all a, b ∈ A. We say a ∗-algebra is real if a = a∗ for every element a of the algebra. We say the
∗-algebra A is nicely normed if a + a∗ ∈ R and aa∗ = a∗ a > 0 for all nonzero a ∈ A. If A is nicely
normed we set
                          Re(a) = (a + a∗ )/2 ∈ R,       Im(a) = (a − a∗ )/2,
and define a norm on A by
                                              kak2 = aa∗ .
If A is nicely normed, it has multiplicative inverses given by

                                            a−1 = a∗ /kak2.

If A is nicely normed and alternative, A is a normed division algebra. To see this, note that for any
a, b ∈ A, all 4 elements a, b, a∗ , b∗ lie in the associative algebra generated by Im(a) and Im(b), so
that
                       kabk2 = (ab)(ab)∗ = ab(b∗ a∗ ) = a(bb∗ )a∗ = kak2 kbk2 .
    Starting from any ∗-algebra A, the Cayley–Dickson construction gives a new ∗-algebra A′ . El-
ements of A′ are pairs (a, b) ∈ A2 , and multiplication and conjugation are defined using equations
(2) and (3). The following propositions show the effect of repeatedly applying the Cayley–Dickson
construction:

Proposition 1. A′ is never real.


Proposition 2. A is real (and thus commutative) ⇐⇒ A′ is commutative.


Proposition 3. A is commutative and associative ⇐⇒ A′ is associative.


Proposition 4. A is associative and nicely normed ⇐⇒ A′ is alternative and nicely normed.


Proposition 5. A is nicely normed ⇐⇒ A′ is nicely normed.


                                                    9
All of these follow from straightforward calculations; to prove them here would merely deprive the
reader of the pleasure of doing so. It follows from these propositions that:
                  R is a real commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒
                    C is a commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒
                           H is an associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒
                             O is an alternative nicely normed ∗-algebra
and therefore that R, C, H, and O are normed division algebras. It also follows that the octonions
are neither real, nor commutative, nor associative.
    If we keep applying the Cayley–Dickson process to the octonions we get a sequence of ∗-algebras
of dimension 16, 32, 64, and so on. The first of these is called the sedenions, presumably alluding
to the fact that it is 16-dimensional [67]. It follows from the above results that all the ∗-algebras in
this sequence are nicely normed but neither real, nor commutative, nor alternative. They all have
multiplicative inverses, since they are nicely normed. But they are not division algebras, since an
explicit calculation demonstrates that the sedenions, and thus all the rest, have zero divisors. In
fact [24, 73], the zero divisors of norm one in the sedenions form a subspace that is homeomorphic
to the exceptional Lie group G2 .
    The Cayley–Dickson construction provides a nice way to obtain the sequence R, H, C, O and the
basic properties of these algebras. But what is the meaning of this construction? To answer this,
it is better to define A′ as the algebra formed by adjoining to A an element i satisfying i2 = −1
together with the following relations:

                      a(ib) = i(a∗ b),     (ai)b = (ab∗ )i,    (ia)(bi−1 ) = (ab)∗                  (4)

for all a, b ∈ A. We make A′ into a ∗-algebra using the original conjugation on elements of A and
setting i∗ = −i. It is easy to check that every element of A′ can be uniquely written as a + ib for
some a, b ∈ A, and that this description of the Cayley–Dickson construction becomes equivalent to
our previous one if we set (a, b) = a + ib.
    What is the significance of the relations in (4)? Simply this: they express conjugation in terms
of conjugation! This is a pun on the double meaning of the word ‘conjugation’. What I really mean
is that they express the ∗ operation in A as conjugation by i. In particular, we have

                                         a∗ = (ia)i−1 = i(ai−1 )

for all a ∈ A. Note that when A′ is associative, any one of the relations in (4) implies the other two.
It is when A′ is nonassociative that we really need all three relations.
    This interpretation of the Cayley–Dickson construction makes it easier to see what happens as
we repeatedly apply the construction starting with R. In R the ∗ operation does nothing, so when
we do the Cayley–Dickson construction, conjugation by i must have no effect on elements of R. Since
R is commutative, this means that C = R′ is commutative. But C is no longer real, since i∗ = −i.
    Next let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to C. Since C is commutative, the ∗ op-
eration in C is an automorphism. Whenever we have an associative algebra A equipped with an
automorphism α, we can always extend A to a larger associative algebra by adjoining an invertible
element x with
                                           α(a) = xax−1
for all a ∈ A. Since C is associative, this means that C′ = H is associative. But since C is not real,
H cannot be commutative, since conjugation by the newly adjoined element i must have a nontrivial
effect.
    Finally, let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to H. Since H is noncommutative, the ∗
operation in H is not an automorphism; it is merely an antiautomorphism. This means we cannot
express it as conjugation by some element of a larger associative algebra. Thus H′ = O must be
nonassociative.


                                                   10
2.3    Clifford Algebras
William Clifford invented his algebras in 1876 as an attempt to generalize the quaternions to higher
dimensions, and he published a paper about them two years later [23]. Given a real inner product
space V , the Clifford algebra Cliff(V ) is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the
relations
                                             v 2 = −kvk2
for all v ∈ V . Equivalently, it is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the relations

                                         vw + wv = −2hv, wi

for all v, w ∈ V . If V = Rn with its usual inner product, we call this Clifford algebra Cliff(n).
Concretely, this is the associative algebra freely generated by n anticommuting square roots of −1.
From this we easily see that

                     Cliff(0) = R,           Cliff(1) = C,          Cliff(2) = H.

So far this sequence resembles the iterated Cayley-Dickson construction — but the octonions are not
a Clifford algebra, since they are nonassociative. Nonetheless, there is a profound relation between
Clifford algebras and normed division algebras. This relationship gives a nice way to prove that
R, C, H and O are the only normed dvivision algebras. It is also crucial for understanding the
geometrical meaning of the octonions.
    To see this relation, first suppose K is a normed division algebra. Left multiplication by any
element a ∈ K gives an operator
                                         La : K → K
                                                 x 7→ ax.
If kak = 1, the operator La is norm-preserving, so it maps the unit sphere of K to itself. Since K
is a division algebra, we can find an operator of this form mapping any point on the unit sphere to
any other point. The only way the unit sphere in K can have this much symmetry is if the norm
on K comes from an inner product. Even better, this inner product is unique, since we can use the
polarization identity
                                          1
                                 hx, yi = (kx + yk2 − kxk2 − kyk2 )
                                          2
to recover it from the norm.
    Using this inner product, we say an element a ∈ K is imaginary if it is orthogonal to the element
1, and we let Im(K) be the space of imaginary elements of K. We can also think of Im(K) as the
tangent space of the unit sphere in K at the point 1. This has a nice consequence: since a 7→ La
maps the unit sphere in K to the Lie group of orthogonal transformations of K, it must send Im(K)
to the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint transformations of K. In short, La is skew-adjoint whenever a is
imaginary.
    The relation to Clifford algebras shows up when we compute the square of La for a ∈ Im(K).
We can do this most easily when a has norm 1. Then La is both orthogonal and skew-adjoint. For
any orthogonal transformation, we can find some orthonormal basis in which its matrix is block
diagonal, built from 2 × 2 blocks that look like this:
                                                           
                                             cos θ    sin θ
                                            − sin θ cos θ

and possibly a 1 × 1 block like this: (1). Such a transformation can only be skew-adjoint if it consists
solely of 2 × 2 blocks of this form:                     
                                                   0 1
                                             ±              .
                                                  −1 0


                                                  11
In this case, its square is −1. We thus have L2a = −1 when a ∈ Im(K) has norm 1. It follows that
                                               L2a = −kak2
for all a ∈ Im(K). We thus obtain a representation of the Clifford algebra Cliff(Im(K)) on K. Any
n-dimensional normed division algebra thus gives an n-dimensional representation of Cliff(n − 1).
As we shall see, this is very constraining.
    We have already described the Clifford algebras up to Cliff(2). Further calculations [54, 78] give
the following table, where we use A[n] to stand for n × n matrices with entries in the algebra A:

                                           n      Cliff(n)
                                           0          R
                                           1          C
                                           2          H
                                           3       H⊕H
                                           4        H[2]
                                           5        C[4]
                                           6        R[8]
                                           7     R[8] ⊕ R[8]

                                    Table 2 — Clifford Algebras

Starting at dimension 8, something marvelous happens: the table continues in the following fashion:
                                   Cliff(n + 8) ∼
                                                = Cliff(n) ⊗ R[16].
In other words, Cliff(n + 8) consists of 16 × 16 matrices with entries in Cliff(n). This ‘period-
8’ behavior was discovered by Cartan in 1908 [16], but we will take the liberty of calling it Bott
periodicity, since it has a far-ranging set of applications to topology, some of which were discovered
by Bott.
    Since Clifford algebras are built from matrix algebras over R, C and H, it is easy to determine
their representations. Every representation is a direct sum of irreducible ones. The only irreducible
representation of R[n] is its obvious one via matrix multiplication on Rn . Similarly, the only irre-
ducible representation of C[n] is the obvious one on Cn , and the only irreducible representation of
H[n] is the obvious one on Hn .
    Glancing at the above table, we see that unless n equals 3 or 7 modulo 8, Cliff(n) is a real,
complex or quaternionic matrix algebra, so it has a unique irreducible representation. For reasons
to be explained later, this irreducible representation is known as the space of pinors and denoted
Pn . When n is 3 or 7 modulo 8, the algebra Cliff(n) is a direct sum of two real or quaternionic
matrix algebras, so it has two irreducible representations, which we call the positive pinors Pn+
and negative pinors Pn− . We summarize these results in the following table:

                             n    Cliff(n)       irreducible representations
                             0        R          P0 = R
                             1        C          P1 = C
                             2        H          P2 = H
                             3     H⊕H           P3+ = H, P3− = H
                             4      H[2]         P4 = H2
                             5      C[4]         P5 = C4
                             6      R[8]         P6 = R8
                             7   R[8] ⊕ R[8]     P7+ = R8 , P7− = R8

                                 Table 3 — Pinor Representations



                                                   12
Examining this table, we see that in the range of dimensions listed there is an n-dimensional rep-
resentation of Cliff(n − 1) only for n = 1, 2, 4, and 8. What about higher dimensions? By Bott
periodicity, the irreducible representations of Cliff(n + 8) are obtained by tensoring those of Cliff(n)
by R16 . This multiplies the dimension by 16, so one can easily check that for n > 8, the irreducible
representations of Cliff(n − 1) always have dimension greater than n.
    It follows that normed division algebras are only possible in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8. Having
constructed R, C, H and O, we also know that normed division algebras exist in these dimensions.
The only remaining question is whether they are unique. For this it helps to investigate more deeply
the relation between normed division algebras and the Cayley-Dickson construction. In what follows,
we outline an approach based on ideas in the book by Springer and Veldkamp [90].
    First, suppose K is a normed division algebra. Then there is a unique linear operator ∗: K → K
such that 1∗ = 1 and a∗ = −a for a ∈ Im(K). With some calculation one can prove this makes K
into a nicely normed ∗-algebra.
    Next, suppose that K0 is any subalgebra of the normed division algebra K. It is easy to check
that K0 is a nicely normed ∗-algebra in its own right. If K0 is not all of K, we can find an element
i ∈ K that is orthogonal to every element of K0 . Without loss of generality we shall assume this
element has norm 1. Since this element i is orthogonal to 1 ∈ K0 , it is imaginary. From the definition
of the ∗ operator it follows that i∗ = −i, and from results earlier in this section we have i2 = −1.
With further calculation one can show that for all a, a′ ∈ K0 we have

                   a(ia′ ) = i(a∗ a′ ),   (ai)a′ = (aa′∗ )i,     (ia)(a′ i−1 ) = (aa′ )∗

A glance at equation (4) reveals that these are exactly the relations defining the Cayley-Dickson
construction! With a little thought, it follows that the subalgebra of K generated by K0 and i is
isomorphic as a ∗-algebra to K′0 , the ∗-algebra obtained from K0 by the Cayley-Dickson construction.
    Thus, whenever we have a normed division algebra K we can find a chain of subalgebras R =
K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Kn = K such that Ki+1 ∼      = K′i . To construct Ki+1 , we simply need to choose a
norm-one element of K that is orthogonal to every element of Ki . It follows that the only normed
division algebras of dimension 1, 2, 4 and 8 are R, C, H and O. This also gives an alternate proof
that there are no normed division algebras of other dimensions: if there were any, there would have
to be a 16-dimensional one, namely O′ — the sedenions. But as mentioned in Section 2.2, one can
check explicitly that the sedenions are not a division algebra.

2.4    Spinors and Trialities
A nonassociative division algebra may seem like a strange thing to bother with, but the notion of
triality makes it seem a bit more natural. The concept of duality is important throughout linear
algebra. The concept of triality is similar, but considerably subtler. Given vector spaces V1 and V2 ,
we may define a duality to be a bilinear map

                                            f : V1 × V2 → R

that is nondegenerate, meaning that if we fix either argument to any nonzero value, the linear
functional induced on the other vector space is nonzero. Similarly, given vector spaces V1 , V2 , and
V3 , a triality is a trilinear map
                                       t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R
that is nondegenerate in the sense that if we fix any two arguments to any nonzero values, the linear
functional induced on the third vector space is nonzero.
   Dualities are easy to come by. Trialities are much rarer. For suppose we have a triality

                                          t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R.



                                                   13
By dualizing, we can turn this into a bilinear map

                                            m: V1 × V2 → V3∗

which we call ‘multiplication’. By the nondegeneracy of our triality, left multiplication by any
nonzero element of V1 defines an isomorphism from V2 to V3∗ . Similarly, right multiplication by any
nonzero element of V2 defines an isomorphism from V1 to V3∗ . If we choose nonzero elements e1 ∈ V1
and e2 ∈ V2 , we can thereby identify the spaces V1 , V2 and V3∗ with a single vector space, say V .
Note that this identifies all three vectors e1 ∈ V1 , e2 ∈ V2 , and e1 e2 ∈ V3∗ with the same vector
e ∈ V . We thus obtain a product
                                           m: V × V → V
for which e is the left and right unit. Since left or right multiplication by any nonzero element is an
isomorphism, V is actually a division algebra! Conversely, any division algebra gives a triality.
     It follows from Theorem 3 that trialities only occur in dimensions 1, 2, 4, or 8. This theorem
is quite deep. By comparison, Hurwitz’s classification of normed division algebras is easy to prove.
Not surprisingly, these correspond to a special sort of triality, which we call a ‘normed’ triality.
     To be precise, a normed triality consists of inner product spaces V1 , V2 , V3 equipped with a
trilinear map t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R with

                                    |t(v1 , v2 , v3 )| ≤ kv1 k kv2 k kv3 k,

and such that for all v1 , v2 there exists v3 6= 0 for which this bound is attained — and similarly for
cyclic permutations of 1, 2, 3. Given a normed triality, picking unit vectors in any two of the spaces
Vi allows us to identify all three spaces and get a normed division algebra. Conversely, any normed
division algebra gives a normed triality.
    But where do normed trialities come from? They come from the theory of spinors! From
Section 2.3, we already know that any n-dimensional normed division algebra is a representation
of Cliff(n − 1), so it makes sense to look for normed trialities here. In fact, representations of
Cliff(n − 1) give certain representations of Spin(n), the double cover of the rotation group in n
dimensions. These are called ‘spinors’. As we shall see, the relation between spinors and vectors
gives a nice way to construct normed trialities in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8.
    To see how this works, first let Pin(n) be the group sitting inside Cliff(n) that consists of all
products of unit vectors in Rn . This group is a double cover of the orthogonal group O(n), where
given any unit vector v ∈ Rn , we map both ±v ∈ Pin(n) to the element of O(n) that reflects across
the hyperplane perpendicular to v. Since every element of O(n) is a product of reflections, this
homomorphism is indeed onto.
    Next, let Spin(n) ⊂ Pin(n) be the subgroup consisting of all elements that are a product of an
even number of unit vectors in Rn . An element of O(n) has determinant 1 iff it is the product of an
even number of reflections, so just as Pin(n) is a double cover of O(n), Spin(n) is a double cover of
SO(n). Together with a French dirty joke which we shall not explain, this analogy is the origin of
the terms ‘Pin’ and ‘pinor’.
    Since Pin(n) sits inside Cliff(n), the irreducible representations of Cliff(n) restrict to representa-
tions of Pin(n), which turn out to be still irreducible. These are again called pinors, and we know
what they are from Table 3. Similarly, Spin(n) sits inside the subalgebra

                                           Cliff 0 (n) ⊆ Cliff(n)

consisting of all linear combinations of products of an even number of vectors in Rn . Thus the
irreducible representations of Cliff 0 (n) restrict to representations of Spin(n), which turn out to be
still irreducible. These are called spinors — but we warn the reader that this term is also used for
many slight variations on this concept.



                                                     14
   In fact, there is an isomorphism

                                       φ: Cliff(n − 1) → Cliff 0 (n)

given as follows:
                                 φ(ei ) = ei en ,           1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
where {ei } is an orthonormal basis for Rn . Thus spinors in n dimensions are the same as pinors in
n − 1 dimensions! Table 3 therefore yields the following table, where we use similar notation but
with ‘S’ instead of ‘P ’:

                             n      Cliff 0 (n)     irreducible representations
                             1          R           S1 = R
                             2          C           S2 = C
                             3          H           S3 = H
                             4       H⊕H            S4+ = H, S4− = H
                             5        H[2]          S5 = H2
                             6        C[4]          S 6 = C4
                             7        R[8]          S 7 = R8
                             8     R[8] ⊕ R[8]      S8+ = R8 , S8− = R8

                                  Table 4 — Spinor Representations

We call Sn+ and Sn− the right-handed and left-handed spinor representations. For n > 8 we can
work out the spinor representations using Bott periodicity:

                                             Sn+8 ∼
                                                  = Sn ⊗ R16

and similarly for right-handed and left-handed spinors.
    Now, besides its pinor representation(s), the group Pin(n) also has an irreducible representation
where we first apply the 2–1 homomorphism Pin(n) → O(n) and then use the obvious representation
of O(n) on Rn . We call this the vector representation, Vn . As a vector space Vn is just Rn , and
Cliff(n) is generated by Rn , so we have an inclusion

                                              Vn ֒→ Cliff(n).

Using this, we can restrict the action of the Clifford algebra on pinors to a map

                                 mn : Vn × Pn± → Pn±         n ≡ 3, 7 mod 8
                                 mn : Vn × Pn → Pn             otherwise.

This map is actually an intertwining operator between representations of Pin(n). If we restrict the
vector representation to the subgroup Spin(n), it remains irreducible. This is not always true for the
pinor representations, but we can always decompose them as a direct sum of spinor representations.
Applying this decomposition to the map mn , we get a map

                                  mn : Vn × Sn± → Sn∓       n ≡ 0, 4 mod 8
                                  mn : Vn × Sn → Sn           otherwise.

All the spinor representations appearing here are self-dual, so we can dualize the above maps and
reinterpret them as trilinear maps

                              tn : Vn × Sn+ × Sn− → R        n ≡ 0, 4 mod 8
                              tn : Vn × Sn × Sn → R            otherwise.


                                                      15
    These trilinear maps are candidates for trialities! However, they can only be trialities when the
dimension of the vector representation matches that of the relevant spinor representations. In the
range of the above table this happens only for n = 1, 2, 4, 8. In these cases we actually do get normed
trialities, which in turn give normed division algebras:

                                    t1 : V1 × S1 × S1 → R        gives R.
                                    t2 : V2 × S2 × S2 → R        gives C.
                                    t4 : V4 × S4+ × S4− → R      gives H.
                                    t8 : V8 × S8+ × S8− → R      gives O.

In higher dimensions, the spinor representations become bigger than the vector representation, so
we get no more trialities this way — and of course, none exist.
    Of the four normed trialities, the one that gives the octonions has an interesting property that
the rest lack. To see this property, one must pay careful attention to the difference between a normed
triality and a normed division algebra. To construct a normed division K algebra from the normed
triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R, we must arbitrarily choose unit vectors in two of the three spaces, so
the symmetry group of K is smaller than that of t. More precisely, let us define a automorphism
of the normed triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R to be a triple of norm–preserving maps fi : Vi → Vi such
that
                                 t(f1 (v1 ), f2 (v2 ), f3 (v3 )) = t(v1 , v2 , v3 )
for all vi ∈ Vi . These automorphisms form a group we call Aut(t). If we construct a normed division
algebra K from t by choosing unit vectors e1 ∈ V1 , e2 ∈ V2 , we have

                     Aut(K) ∼
                            = {(f1 , f2 , f3 ) ∈ Aut(t) : f1 (e1 ) = e1 , f2 (e2 ) = e2 }.

   In particular, it turns out that:

           1       ∼
                   =    Aut(R)     ⊆    Aut(t1 )   ∼
                                                   =    {(g1 , g2 , g3 ) ∈ O(1)3 : g1 g2 g3 = 1}
           Z2      ∼
                   =    Aut(C)     ⊆    Aut(t2 )   ∼
                                                   =    {(g1 , g2 , g3 ) ∈ U(1)3 : g1 g2 g3 = 1} × Z2
                   ∼                               ∼                                                    (5)

are the unit spheres in R, C and H, respectively — the only spheres that are Lie groups. G2 is just
another name for the automorphism group of the octonions; we shall study this group in Section 4.1.
The bigger group Spin(8) acts as automorphisms of the triality that gives the octonions, and it does
so in an interesting way. Given any element g ∈ Spin(8), there exist unique elements g± ∈ Spin(8)
such that
                               t(g(v1 ), g+ (v2 ), g− (v3 )) = t(v1 , v2 , v3 )
for all v1 ∈ V8 , v2 ∈ S8+ , and v3 ∈ S8− . Moreover, the maps

                                                α± : g → g±

are outer automorphisms of Spin(8). In fact Out(Spin(8)) is the permutation group on 3 letters, and
there exist outer automorphisms that have the effect of permuting the vector, left-handed spinor,
and right-handed spinor representations any way one likes; α+ and α− are among these.
    In general, outer automorphisms of simple Lie groups come from symmetries of their Dynkin
diagrams. Of all the simple Lie groups, Spin(8) has the most symmetrical Dynkin diagram! It looks
like this:




                                                       16
Here the three outer nodes correspond to the vector, left-handed spinor and right-handed spinor
representations of Spin(8), while the central node corresponds to the adjoint representation —
that is, the representation of Spin(8) on its own Lie algebra, better known as so(8). The outer
automorphisms corresponding to the symmetries of this diagram were discovered in 1925 by Cartan
[17], who called these symmetries triality. The more general notion of ‘triality’ we have been
discussing here came later, and is apparently due to Adams [2].
    The construction of division algebras from trialities has tantalizing links to physics. In the
Standard Model of particle physics, all particles other than the Higgs boson transform either as
vectors or spinors. The vector particles are also called ‘gauge bosons’, and they serve to carry the
forces in the Standard Model. The spinor particles are also called ‘fermions’, and they correspond
to the basic forms of matter: quarks and leptons. The interaction between matter and the forces is
described by a trilinear map involving two spinors and one vector. This map is often drawn as a
Feynman diagram:




where the straight lines denote spinors and the wiggly one denotes a vector. The most familiar
example is the process whereby an electron emits or absorbs a photon.
    It is fascinating that the same sort of mathematics can be used both to construct the normed
division algebras and to describe the interaction between matter and forces. Could this be important
for physics? One prima facie problem with this speculation is that physics uses spinors associated to
Lorentz groups rather than rotation groups, due to the fact that spacetime has a Lorentzian rather
than Euclidean metric. However, in Section 3.3 we describe a way around this problem. Just as
octonions give the spinor representations of Spin(8), pairs of octonions give the spinor representations
of Spin(9, 1). This is one reason so many theories of physics work best when spacetime is 10-
dimensional! Examples include superstring theory [29, 46], supersymmetric gauge theories [35, 65,
85], and Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C ⊗ H ⊗ O, in which
the 3 forces arise naturally from the three factors in this tensor product [31].


3     Octonionic Projective Geometry
Projective geometry is a venerable subject that has its origins in the study of perspective by Re-
naissance painters. As seen by the eye, parallel lines — e.g., train tracks — appear to meet at a
‘point at infinity’. When one changes ones viewpoint, distances and angles appear to change, but
points remain points and lines remain lines. These facts suggest a modification of Euclidean plane
geometry, based on a set of points, a set of lines, and relation whereby a point ‘lies on’ a line,
satisfying the following axioms:
    • For any two distinct points, there is a unique line on which they both lie.
    • For any two distinct lines, there is a unique point which lies on both of them.


                                                  17
   • There exist four points, no three of which lie on the same line.
   • There exist four lines, no three of which have the same point lying on them.
A structure satisfying these axioms is called a projective plane. Part of the charm of this definition
is that it is ‘self-dual’: if we switch the words ‘point’ and ‘line’ and switch who lies on whom, it
stays the same.
    We have already met one example of a projective plane in Section 2.1: the smallest one of all, the
Fano plane. The example relevant to perspective is the real projective plane, RP2 . Here the points
are lines through the origin in R3 , the lines are planes through the origin in R3 , and the relation of
‘lying on’ is taken to be inclusion. Each point (x, y) ∈ R2 determines a point in RP2 , namely the
line in R3 containing the origin and the point (x, y, −1):




                                                     (0,0,0)




                                                               (x , y ,−1)




There are also other points in RP2 , the ‘points at infinity’, corresponding to lines through the origin
in R3 that do not intersect the plane {z = −1}. For example, any point on the horizon in the above
picture determines a point at infinity.
    Projective geometry is also interesting in higher dimensions. One can define a projective space
by the following axioms:
   • For any two distinct points p, q, there is a unique line pq on which they both lie.
   • For any line, there are at least three points lying on this line.
   • If a, b, c, d are distinct points and there is a point lying on both ab and cd, then there is a point
     lying on both ac and bd.
Given a projective space and a set S of points in this space, we define the span of S to be the
smallest set T of points containing S such that if a and b lie in T , so do all points on the line ab.
The dimension of a projective space is defined to be one less than the minimal cardinality of a set
that spans the whole space. The reader may enjoy showing that a 2-dimensional projective space is
the same thing as a projective plane [44].
    If K is any field, there is an n-dimensional projective space called KPn where the points are lines
through the origin in Kn+1 , the lines are planes through the origin in Kn+1 , and the relation of
‘lying on’ is inclusion. In fact, this construction works even when K is a mere skew field: a ring
such that every nonzero element has a left and right multiplicative inverse. We just need to be a bit
careful about defining lines and planes through the origin in Kn+1 . To do this, we use the fact that
Kn+1 is a K-bimodule in an obvious way. We take a line through the origin to be any set

                                          L = {αx : α ∈ K}

where x ∈ Kn+1 is nonzero, and take a plane through the origin to be any set

                                      P = {αx + βy : α, β ∈ K}


                                                   18
where x, y ∈ Kn+1 are elements such that αx + βy = 0 implies α, β = 0.
   Given this example, the question naturally arises whether every projective n-space is of the form
KPn for some skew field K. The answer is quite surprising: yes, but only if n > 2. Projective planes
are more subtle [91]. A projective plane comes from a skew field if and only if it satisfies an extra
axiom, the ‘axiom of Desargues’, which goes as follows. Define a triangle to be a triple of points
that don’t all lie on the same line. Now, suppose we have two triangles xyz and x′ y ′ z ′ . The sides of
each triangle determine three lines, say LM N and L′ M ′ N ′ . Sometimes the line through x and x′ ,
the line through y and y ′ , and the line through z and z ′ will all intersect at the same point:

                                                     x


                                                                                 x

                                             L
                                                                 L
                                                         N
                                                                             N

                                         y                   y

                                                             M
                                                 M

                                                                     z
                                                         z




The axiom of Desargues says that whenever this happens, something else happens: the intersec-
tion of L and L′ , the intersection of M and M ′ , and the intersection of N and N ′ all lie on the same
line:

                                                     L
                                                                             L
                                                                 N


                                                                                     N
                                                     M                   M




This axiom holds automatically for projective spaces of dimension 3 or more, but not for projective
planes. A projective plane satisfying this axiom is called Desarguesian.
    The axiom of Desargues is pretty, but what is its connection to skew fields? Suppose we start
with a projective plane P and try to reconstruct a skew field from it. We can choose any line L,
choose three distinct points on this line, call them 0, 1, and ∞, and set K = L − {∞}. Copying
geometric constructions that work when P = RP2 , we can define addition and multiplication of
points in K. In general the resulting structure (K, +, 0, ·, 1) will not be a skew field. Even worse, it
will depend in a nontrivial way on the choices made. However, if we assume the axiom of Desargues,
these problems go away. We thus obtain a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes
of skew fields and isomorphism classes of Desarguesian projective planes.
    Projective geometry was very fashionable in the 1800s, with such worthies as Poncelet, Brianchon,
Steiner and von Staudt making important contributions. Later it was overshadowed by other forms
of geometry. However, work on the subject continued, and in 1933 Ruth Moufang constructed a
remarkable example of a non-Desarguesian projective plane using the octonions [74]. As we shall
see, this projective plane deserves the name OP2 .
    The 1930s also saw the rise of another reason for interest in projective geometry: quantum
mechanics! Quantum theory is distressingly different from the classical Newtonian physics we have



                                                                 19
learnt to love. In classical mechanics, observables are described by real-valued functions. In quantum
mechanics, they are often described by hermitian n × n complex matrices. In both cases, observables
are closed under addition and multiplication by real scalars. However, in quantum mechanics,
observables do not form an associative algebra. Still, one can raise an observable to a power, and
from squaring one can construct a commutative but nonassociative product:
                                      1                        1
                             a◦b=       ((a + b)2 − a2 − b2 ) = (ab + ba).
                                      2                        2
In 1932, Pascual Jordan attempted to understand this situation better by isolating the bare minimum
axioms that an ‘algebra of observables’ should satisfy [57]. He invented the definition of what is now
called a formally real Jordan algebra: a commutative and power-associative algebra satisfying

                            a21 + · · · + a2n = 0   =⇒     a1 = · · · = an = 0

for all n. The last condition gives the algebra a partial ordering: if we write a ≤ b when the element
b − a is a sum of squares, it says that a ≤ b and b ≤ a imply a = b. Though it is not obvious, any
formally real Jordan algebra satisfies the identity

                                        a ◦ (b ◦ a2 ) = (a ◦ b) ◦ a2

for all elements a and b. Any commutative algebra satisfying this identity is called a Jordan
algebra. Jordan algebras are automatically power-associative.
    In 1934, Jordan published a paper with von Neumann and Wigner classifying all formally real
Jordan algebras [59]. The classification is nice and succinct. An ideal in the Jordan algebra A is a
subspace B ⊆ A such that b ∈ B implies a ◦ b ∈ B for all a ∈ A. A Jordan algebra A is simple if its
only ideals are {0} and A itself. Every formally real Jordan algebra is a direct sum of simple ones.
The simple formally real Jordan algebras consist of 4 infinite families and one exception.
  1. The algebra hn (R) with the product a ◦ b = 12 (ab + ba).
  2. The algebra hn (C) with the product a ◦ b = 21 (ab + ba).
  3. The algebra hn (H) with the product a ◦ b = 21 (ab + ba).
  4. The algebra Rn ⊕ R with the product

                                  (v, α) ◦ (w, β) = (αw + βv, hv, wi + αβ).

  5. The algebra h3 (O) with the product a ◦ b = 21 (ab + ba).
Here we say a square matrix with entries in the ∗-algebra A is hermitian if it equals its conjugate
transpose, and we let hn (A) stand for the hermitian n×n matrices with entries in A. Jordan algebras
in the fourth family are called spin factors, while h3 (O) is called the exceptional Jordan algebra.
This classification raises some obvious questions. Why does nature prefer the Jordan algebras hn (C)
over all the rest? Or does it? Could the other Jordan algebras — even the exceptional one — have
some role to play in quantum physics? Despite much research, these questions remain unanswered
to this day.
    The paper by Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner appears to have been uninfluenced by Moufang’s
discovery of OP2 , but in fact they are related. A projection in a formally real Jordan algebra is
defined to be an element p with p2 = p. In the familiar case of hn (C), these correspond to hermitian
matrices with eigenvalues 0 and 1, so they are used to describe observables that assume only two
values — e.g., ‘true’ and ‘false’. This suggests treating projections in a formally real Jordan algebra
as propositions in a kind of ‘quantum logic’. The partial order helps us do this: given projections p
and q, we say that p ‘implies’ q if p ≤ q.


                                                    20
    The relation between Jordan algebras and quantum logic is already interesting [34], but the
real fun starts when we note that projections in hn (C) correspond to subspaces of Cn . This sets
up a relationship to projective geometry [98], since the projections onto 1-dimensional subspaces
correspond to points in CPn , while the projections onto 2-dimensional subspaces correspond to
lines. Even better, we can work out the dimension of a subspace V ⊆ Cn from the corresponding
projection p: Cn → V using only the partial order on projections: V has dimension d iff the longest
chain of distinct projections
                                      0 = p0 < · · · < pi = p
has length i = d. In fact, we can use this to define the rank of a projection in any formally
real Jordan algebra. We can then try to construct a projective space whose points are the rank-1
projections and whose lines are the rank-2 projections, with the relation of ‘lying on’ given by the
partial order ≤.
    If we try this starting with hn (R), hn (C) or hn (H), we succeed when n ≥ 2, and we obtain the
projective spaces RPn , CPn and HPn , respectively. If we try this starting with the spin factor Rn ⊕R
we succeed when n ≥ 2, and obtain a series of 1-dimensional projective spaces related to Lorentzian
geometry. Finally, in 1949 Jordan [58] discovered that if we try this construction starting with the
exceptional Jordan algebra, we get the projective plane discovered by Moufang: OP2 .
    In what follows we describe the octonionic projective plane and exceptional Jordan algebra in
more detail. But first let us consider the octonionic projective line, and the Jordan algebra h2 (O).

3.1    Projective Lines
A one-dimensional projective space is called a projective line. Projective lines are not very inter-
esting from the viewpoint of axiomatic projective geometry, since they have only one line on which
all the points lie. Nonetheless, they can be geometrically and topologically interesting. This is
especially true of the octonionic projective line. As we shall see, this space has a deep connection
to Bott periodicity, and also to the Lorentzian geometry of 10-dimensional spacetime.
    Suppose K is a normed division algebra. We have already defined KP1 when K is associative,
but this definition does not work well for the octonions: it is wiser to take a detour through Jordan
algebras. Let h2 (K) be the space of 2 × 2 hermitian matrices with entries in K. It is easy to check
that this becomes a Jordan algebra with the product a ◦ b = 12 (ab + ba). We can try to build a
projective space from this Jordan algebra using the construction in the previous section. To see if
this succeeds, we need to ponder the projections in h2 (K). A little calculation shows that besides
the trivial projections 0 and 1, they are all of the form
                                   ∗                  ∗          
                                    x                    x x x∗ y
                                            x    y   =
                                    y∗                    y∗x y∗y

where (x, y) ∈ K2 has
                                            kxk2 + kyk2 = 1.
These nontrivial projections all have rank 1, so they are the points of our would–be projective space.
Our would–be projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1, and all the points
lie on this line. It is easy to check that the axioms for a projective space hold. Since this projective
space is 1-dimensional, we have succeeded in creating the projective line over K. We call the set
of points of this projective line KP1 .
    Given any nonzero element (x, y) ∈ K2 , we can normalize it and then use the above formula to
get a point in KP1 , which we call [(x, y)]. This allows us to describe KP1 in terms of lines through
the origin, as follows. Define an equivalence relation on nonzero elements of K2 by

                              (x, y) ∼ (x′ , y ′ ) ⇐⇒ [(x, y)] = [(x′ , y ′ )].



                                                     21
We call an equivalence class for this relation a line through the origin in K2 . We can then identify
points in KP1 with lines through the origin in K2 .
   Be careful: when K is the octonions, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is not always
equal to
                                           {(αx, αy) : α ∈ K}.
This is only true when K is associative, or when x or y is 1. Luckily, we have (x, y) ∼ (y −1 x, 1)
when y 6= 0 and (x, y) ∼ (1, x−1 y) when x 6= 0. Thus in either case we get a concrete description of
the line through the origin containing (x, y): when x 6= 0 it equals
                                        {(α(y −1 x), α) : α ∈ K},
and when y 6= 0 it equals
                                         {(α, α(x−1 y) : α ∈ K}.
In particular, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is always a real vector space isomorphic
to K.
    We can make KP1 into a manifold as follows. By the above observations, we can cover it with
two coordinate charts: one containing all points of the form [(x, 1)], the other containing all points
of the form [(1, y)]. It is easy to check that [(x, 1)] = [(1, y)] iff y = x−1 , so the transition function
from the first chart to the second is the map x 7→ x−1 . Since this transition function and its inverse
are smooth on the intersection of the two charts, KP1 becomes a smooth manifold.
    When pondering the geometry of projective lines it is handy to visualize the complex case, since
CP1 is just the familiar ‘Riemann sphere’. In this case, the map
                                               x 7→ [(x, 1)]
is given by stereographic projection:




                                                         [x ,1]



                                                                  x
                                                     0




where we choose the sphere to have diameter 1. This map from C to CP1 is one-to-one and almost
onto, missing only the point at infinity, or ‘north pole’. Similarly, the map
                                               y 7→ [(1, y)]
misses only the south pole. Composing the first map with the inverse of the second, we get the
map x 7→ x−1 , which goes by the name of ‘conformal inversion’. The southern hemisphere of the
Riemann sphere consists of all points [(x, 1)] with kxk ≤ 1, while the northern hemisphere consists
of all [(1, y)] with kyk ≤ 1. Unit complex numbers x give points [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1 )] on the equator.
    All these ideas painlessly generalize to KP1 for any normed division algebra K. First of all, as a
smooth manifold KP1 is just a sphere with dimension equal to that of K:

                                                    22
We can think of it as the one-point compactification of K. The ‘southern hemisphere’, ‘northern
hemisphere’, and ‘equator’ of K have descriptions exactly like those given above for the complex
case. Also, as in the complex case, the maps x 7→ [(x, 1)] and y 7→ [(1, y)] are angle-preserving with
respect to the usual Euclidean metric on K and the round metric on the sphere.
    One of the nice things about KP1 is that it comes equipped with a vector bundle whose fiber over
the point [(x, y)] is the line through the origin corresponding to this point. This bundle is called the
canonical line bundle, LK . Of course, when we are working with a particular division algebra,
‘line’ means a copy of this division algebra, so if we think of them as real vector bundles, LR , LC , LH
and LO have dimensions 1,2,4, and 8, respectively.
    These bundles play an important role in topology, so it is good to understand them in a number
of ways. In general, any k-dimensional real vector bundle over S n can be formed by taking trivial
bundles over the northern and southern hemispheres and gluing them together along the equator via
a map f : S n−1 → O(k). We must therefore be able to build the canonical line bundles LR , LC , LH
and LO using maps
                                           fR : S 0 → O(1)
                                           fC : S 1 → O(2)
                                           fH : S 3 → O(4)
                                           fO : S 7 → O(8).
What are these maps? We can describe them all simultaneously. Suppose K is a normed division
algebra of dimension n. In the southern hemisphere of KP1 , we can identify any fiber of LK with K
by mapping the point (αx, α) in the line [(x, 1)] to the element α ∈ K. This trivializes the canonical
line bundle over the southern hemisphere. Similarly, we can trivialize this bundle over the northern
hemisphere by mapping the point (β, βy) in the line [(1, y)] to the element β ∈ K. If x ∈ K has
norm one, [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1 )] is a point on the equator, so we get two trivializations of the fiber
over this point. These are related as follows: if (αx, α) = (β, βx−1 ) then β = αx. The map α 7→ β
is thus right multiplication by x. In short,

                                           fK : S n−1 → O(n)

is just the map sending any norm-one element x ∈ K to the operation of right multiplication by x.
     The importance of the map fK becomes clearest if we form the inductive limit of the groups O(n)
using the obvious inclusions O(n) ֒→ O(n + 1), obtaining a topological group called O(∞). Since
O(n) is included in O(∞), we can think of fK as a map from S n−1 to O(∞). Its homotopy class
[fK ] has the following marvelous property, mentioned in the Introduction:

   • [fR ] generates π0 (O(∞)) ∼
                               = Z2 .
   • [fC ] generates π1 (O(∞)) ∼
                               = Z.
   • [fH ] generates π3 (O(∞)) ∼
                               = Z.
   • [fO ] generates π7 (O(∞)) ∼
                               = Z.

    Another nice perspective on the canonical line bundles LK comes from looking at their unit
sphere bundles. Any fiber of LK is naturally an inner product space, since it is a line through the
origin in K2 . If we take the unit sphere in each fiber, we get a bundle of (n − 1)-spheres over KP1
called the Hopf bundle:
                                            pK : EK → KP1
The projection pK is called the Hopf map. The total space EK consists of all the unit vectors in




                                                   23
K2 , so it is a sphere of dimension 2n − 1. In short, the Hopf bundles look like this:

                                 K=R:            S 0 ֒→ S 1     →    S1
                                 K=C:            S 1 ֒→ S 3     →    S2
                                 K=H:            S 3 ֒→ S 7     →    S4
                                 K=O:            S 7 ֒→ S 15    →    S8

    We can understand the Hopf maps better by thinking about inverse images of points. The inverse
image p−1                           n
         K (x) of any point x ∈ S is a (n − 1)-sphere in S
                                                              2n−1
                                                                   , and the inverse image of any pair
of distinct points is a pair of linked spheres of this sort. When K = C we get linked circles in S 3 ,
which form the famous Hopf link:




When K = O, we get a pair of linked 7-spheres in S 15 .
    To quantify this notion of linking, we can use the ‘Hopf invariant’. Suppose for a moment that
n is any natural number greater than one, and let f : S 2n−1 → S n be any smooth map. If ω is the
normalized volume form on S n , then f ∗ ω is a closed n-form on S 2n−1 . Since the nth cohomology of
S 2n−1 vanishes, f ∗ ω = dα for some (n − 1)-form α. We define the Hopf invariant of f to be the
number                                           Z
                                        H(f ) =         α ∧ dα.
                                                   S 2n−1
This is easily seen to be invariant under smooth homotopies of the map f .
    To see how the Hopf invariant is related to linking, we can compute it using homology rather than
cohomology. If we take any two regular values of f , say x and y, the inverse images of these points
are compact oriented (n − 1)-dimensional submanifolds of S 2n−1 . We can always find an oriented n-
dimensional submanifold X ⊂ S 2n−1 that has boundary equal to f −1 (x) and that intersects f −1 (y)
transversely. The dimensions of X and f −1 (y) add up to 2n − 1, so their intersection number is well-
defined. By the duality between homology and cohomology, this number equals the Hopf invariant
H(f ). This shows that the Hopf invariant is an integer. Moreover, it shows that when the Hopf
invariant is nonzero, the inverse images of x and y are linked.
    Using either of these approaches we can compute the Hopf invariant of pC , pH and pO . They all
turn out to have Hopf invariant 1. This implies, for example, that the inverse images of distinct
points under pO are nontrivially linked 7-spheres in S 15 . It also implies that pC , pH and pO give
nontrivial elements of π2n−1 (S n ) for n = 2, 4, and 8. In fact, these elements generate the torsion-free
part of π2n−1 (S n ).
    A deep study of the Hopf invariant is one way to prove that any division algebra must have
dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8. One can show that if there exists an n-dimensional division algebra, then
S n−1 must be parallelizable: it must admit n − 1 pointwise linearly independent smooth vector
fields. One can also show that for n > 1, S n−1 is parallelizable iff there exists a map f : S 2n−1 → S n
with H(f ) = 1 [3, 11, 62]. The hard part is showing that a map from S 2n−1 to S n can have Hopf
invariant 1 only if n = 2, 4, or 8. This was proved by Adams sometime about 1958 [1].

3.2    OP1 and Bott Periodicity
We already touched upon Bott periodicity when we mentioned that the Clifford algebra Cliff n+8
is isomorphic to the algebra of 16 × 16 matrices with entries lying in Cliff n . This is but one of



                                                   24
many related ‘period-8’ phenomena that go by the name of Bott periodicity. The appearance of
the number 8 here is no coincidence: all these phenomena are related to the octonions! Since this
marvelous fact is somewhat under-appreciated, it seems worthwhile to say a bit about it. Here we
shall focus on those aspects that are related to OP1 and the canonical octonionic line bundle over
this space.
     Let us start with K-theory. This is a way of gaining information about a topological space by
studying the vector bundles over it. If the space has holes in it, there will be nontrivial vector
bundles that have ‘twists’ as we go around these holes. The simplest example is the ‘Möbius strip’
bundle over S 1 , a 1-dimensional real vector bundle which has a 180◦ twist as we go around the circle.
In fact, this is just the canonical line bundle LR . The canonical line bundles LC , LH and LO provide
higher-dimensional analogues of this example.
     K-theory tells us to study the vector bundles over a topological space X by constructing an
abelian group as follows. First, take the set consisting of all isomorphism classes of real vector
bundles over X. Our ability to take direct sums of vector bundles gives this set an ‘addition’
operation making it into a commutative monoid. Next, adjoin formal ‘additive inverses’ for all the
elements of this set, obtaining an abelian group. This group is called KO(X), the real K-theory
of X. Alternatively we could start with complex vector bundles and get a group called K(X), but
here we will be interested in real vector bundles.
     Any real vector bundle E over X gives an element [E] ∈ KO(X), and these elements generate
this group. If we pick a point in X, there is an obvious homomorphism dim: KO(X) → Z sending
[E] to the dimension of the fiber of E at this point. Since the dimension is a rather obvious and
boring invariant of vector bundles, it is nice to work with the kernel of this homomorphism, which is
called the reduced real K-theory of X and denoted g    KO(X). This is an invariant of pointed spaces,
i.e. spaces equipped with a designated point or basepoint.
     Any sphere becomes a pointed space if we take the north pole as basepoint. The reduced real
K-theory of the first eight spheres looks like this:

As mentioned in the previous section, one can build any k-dimensional real vector bundle over
S n using a map f : S n−1 → O(k). In fact, isomorphism classes of such bundles are in one-to-one
correspondence with homotopy classes of such maps. Moreover, two such bundles determine the
                g
same element of KO(X)     if and only if the corresponding maps become homotopy equivalent after



                                                     25
we compose them with the inclusion O(k) ֒→ O(∞), where O(∞) is the direct limit of the groups
O(k). It follows that

                                   KO(S    = πn−1 (O(∞)).
This fact gives us the list of homotopy groups of O(∞) which appears in the Introduction. It also
means that to prove Bott periodicity for these homotopy groups:

                                         πi+8 (O(∞)) ∼
                                                     = πi (O(∞)),

it suffices to prove Bott periodicity for real K-theory:
                                          g n+8 ) ∼
                                          KO(S      g n ).
                                                  = KO(S

   Why do we have Bott periodicity in real K-theory? It turns out that there is a graded ring KO
with
                                               g n ).
                                       KOn = KO(S
The product in this ring comes from our ability to take ‘smash products’ of spheres and also of real
vector bundles over these spheres. Multiplying by [LO ] gives an isomorphism

                                      g n) →
                                      KO(S               g n+8 )

In other words, the canonical octonionic line bundle over OP1 generates Bott periodicity!
    There is much more to say about this fact and how it relates to Bott periodicity for Clifford
algebras, but alas, this would take us too far afield. We recommend that the interested reader turn
to some introductory texts on K-theory, for example the one by Dale Husemoller [56]. Unfortunately,
all the books I know downplay the role of the octonions. To spot it, one must bear in mind the
relation between the octonions and Clifford algebras, discussed in Section 2.3 above.

3.3    OP1 and Lorentzian Geometry
In Section 3.1 we sketched a systematic approach to projective lines over the normed division alge-
bras. The most famous example is the Riemann sphere, CP1 . As emphasized by Penrose [77], this
space has a fascinating connection to Lorentzian geometry — or in other words, special relativity.
All conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere come from fractional linear transformations
                                         az + b
                                  z 7→          ,          a, b, c, d ∈ C.
                                         cz + d
It is easy to see that the group of such transformations is isomorphic to PSL(2, C): 2 × 2 complex
matrices with determinant 1, modulo scalar multiples of the identity. Less obviously, it is also isomor-
phic to the Lorentz group SO0 (3, 1): the identity component of the group of linear transformations
of R4 that preserve the Minkowski metric

                                  x · y = x1 y1 + x2 y2 + x3 y3 − x4 y4 .

This fact has a nice explanation in terms of the ‘heavenly sphere’. Mathematically, this is the 2-
sphere consisting of all lines of the form {αx} where x ∈ R4 has x · x = 0. In special relativity such
lines represent light rays, so the heavenly sphere is the sphere on which the stars appear to lie when
you look at the night sky. This sphere inherits a conformal structure from the Minkowski metric on
R4 . This allows us to identify the heavenly sphere with CP1 , and it implies that the Lorentz group
acts as conformal transformations of CP1 . In concrete terms, what this means is that if you shoot
past the earth at nearly the speed of light, the constellations in the sky will appear distorted, but
all angles will be preserved.


                                                    26
    In fact, these results are not special to the complex case: the same ideas work for the other
normed division algebras as well! The algebras R, C, H and O are related to Lorentzian geometry
in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions, respectively [68, 69, 70, 85, 93]. Even better, a full explanation of
this fact brings out new relationships between the normed division algebras and spinors. In what
follows we explain how this works for all 4 normed division algebras, with special attention to the
peculiarities of the octonionic case.
    To set the stage, we first recall the most mysterious of the four infinite series of Jordan algebras
listed at the beginning of Section 3: the spin factors. We described these quite concretely, but a more
abstract approach brings out their kinship to Clifford algebras. Given an n-dimensional real inner
product space V , let the spin factor J(V ) be the Jordan algebra freely generated by V modulo
relations
                                                v 2 = kvk2 .
Polarizing and applying the commutative law, we obtain

                                            v ◦ w = hv, wi,

so J(V ) is isomorphic to V ⊕ R with the product

                               (v, α) ◦ (w, β) = (αw + βv, hv, wi + αβ).

   Though Jordan algebras were invented to study quantum mechanics, the spin factors are also
deeply related to special relativity. We can think of J(V ) ∼
                                                            = V ⊕ R as Minkowksi spacetime, with
V as space and R as time. The reason is that J(V ) is naturally equipped with a symmetric bilinear
form of signature (n, 1), the Minkowski metric:

                                     (v, α) · (w, β) = hv, wi − αβ.

The group of linear transformations preserving the Minkowski metric is called O(n, 1), and the
identity component of this is called the Lorentz group, SO0 (n, 1). We define the lightcone C(V )
to consist of all nonzero x ∈ J(V ) with x · x = 0. A 1-dimensional subspace of J(V ) spanned by an
element of the lightcone is called a light ray, and the space of all light rays is called the heavenly
sphere S(V ). We can identify the heavenly sphere with the unit sphere in V , since every light ray
is spanned by an element of the form (v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. Here is a picture of the
lightcone and the heavenly sphere when V is 2-dimensional:

                                           C(V )
                                                        S( V )




                                                                 V




    When V is at least 2-dimensional, we can build a projective space from the Jordan algebra J(V ).
The result is none other than the heavenly sphere! To see this, note that aside from the elements 0
and 1, all projections in J(V ) are of the form p = 21 (v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. These are the
points of our projective space, but as we have seen, they also correspond to points of the heavenly
sphere. Our projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1 ∈ J(V ). We can
visualize this line as the heavenly sphere itself.




                                                   27
    What does all this have to do with normed division algebras? To answer this, let K be a normed
division algebra of dimension n. Then the Jordan algebra h2 (K) is secretly a spin factor! There is
an isomorphism
                                 φ: h2 (K) → J(K ⊕ R) ∼
                                                      =K⊕R⊕R
given by                                 
                              α+β    x
                      φ                       = (x, β, α),        x ∈ K, α, β ∈ R.                (6)
                               x∗   α−β
Furthermore, the determinant of matrices in h2 (K) is well-defined even when K is noncommutative
or nonassociative:                              
                                 α+β        x
                           det                      = α2 − β 2 − kxk2 ,
                                  x∗      α−β
and clearly we have
                                          det(a) = −φ(a) · φ(a)
for all a ∈ h2 (K).
    These facts have a number of nice consequences. First of all, since the Jordan algebras J(K ⊕ R)
and h2 (K) are isomorphic, so are their associated projective spaces. We have seen that the former
space is the heavenly sphere S(K ⊕ R), and that the latter is KP1 . It follows that
                                            KP1 ∼
                                                = S(K ⊕ R).
This gives another proof of something we already saw in Section 3.1: KP1 is an n-sphere. But it
shows more. The Lorentz group SO0 (n + 1, 1) has an obvious action on the heavenly sphere, and the
usual conformal structure on the sphere is invariant under this action. Using the above isomorphism
we can transfer this group action and invariant conformal structure to KP1 in a natural way.
   Secondly, it follows that the determinant-preserving linear transformations of h2 (K) form a group
isomorphic to O(n + 1, 1). How can we find some transformations of this sort? If K = R, this is
easy: when g ∈ SL(2, R) and x ∈ h2 (R), we again have gxg ∗ ∈ h2 (R), and
                                          det(gxg ∗ ) = det(x).
This gives a homomorphism from SL(2, R) to O(2, 1). This homomorphism is two–to–one, since
both g = 1 and g = −1 act trivially, and it maps SL(2, R) onto the identity component of O(2, 1). It
follows that SL(2, R) is a double cover of SO0 (2, 1). The exact same construction works for K = C,
so SL(2, C) is a double cover of SO0 (3, 1).
    For the other two normed division algebras the above calculation involving determinants breaks
down, and it even becomes tricky to define the group SL(2, K), so we start by working at the Lie
algebra level. We say a m × m matrix with entries in the normed division algebra K is traceless if
the sum of its diagonal entries is zero. Any such traceless matrix acts as a real–linear operator on
Km . When K is commutative and associative, the space of operators coming from m × m traceless
matrices with entries in K is closed under commutators, but otherwise it is not, so we define sl(m, K)
to be the Lie algebra of operators on Km generated by operators of this form. This Lie algebra in
turn generates a Lie group of real-linear operators on Km , which we call SL(m, K). Note that
multiplication in this group is given by composition of real-linear operators, which is associative
even for K = O.
    The Lie algebra sl(m, K) comes born with a representation: its fundamental representation
as real-linear operators on Km , given by
                                     a: x 7→ ax,             x ∈ Km
whenever a ∈ sl(m, K) actually corresponds to a traceless m× m matrix with entries in K. Tensoring
the fundamental representation with its dual, we get a representation of sl(m, K) on the space of
matrices K[m], given by
                                a: x 7→ ax + xa∗ ,        x ∈ K[m]


                                                     28
whenever a is a traceless matrix with entries in K. Since ax + xa∗ is hermitian whenever x is, this
representation restricts to a representation of sl(m, K) on hm (K). This in turn can be exponentiated
to obtain a representation of the group SL(m, K) on hm (K).
    Now let us return to the case m = 2. One can prove that the representation of SL(2, K) on h2 (K)
is determinant-preserving simply by checking that
                                  d
                                     det(x + t(ax + xa∗ ))     =0
                                  dt                       t=0

when x lies in h2 (K) and a ∈ K[2] is traceless. Here the crucial thing is to make sure that the
calculation is not spoiled by noncommutativity or nonassociativity. It follows that we have a homo-
morphism
                                   αK : SL(2, K) → SO0 (n + 1, 1)
One can check that this is onto, and that its kernel consists of the matrices ±1. Thus if we define

                                    PSL(2, K) = SL(2, K)/{±1},

we get isomorphisms
                                     PSL(2, R)    ∼
                                                  =   SO0 (2, 1)
                                     PSL(2, C)    ∼
                                                  =   SO0 (3, 1)
                                     PSL(2, H)    ∼
                                                  =   SO0 (6, 1)
                                     PSL(2, O)    ∼
                                                  =   SO0 (9, 1).
Putting this together with our earlier observations, it follows that PSL(2, K) acts as conformal
transformations of KP1 .
   We conclude with some words about how all this relates to spinors. The machinery of Clifford
algebras and spinors extends effortlessly from the case of inner product spaces to vector spaces
equipped with an indefinite metric. In particular, the Lorentz group SO0 (n + 1, 1) has a double
cover called Spin(n + 1, 1), and this group has certain representations called spinor representations.
When n = 1, 2, 4 or 8, we actually have

                                      Spin(n + 1, 1) ∼
                                                     = SL(2, K)

where K is the normed division algebra of dimension n. The fundamental representation of SL(2, K)
on K2 is the left-handed spinor representation of Spin(n + 1, 1). Its dual is the right-handed spinor
representation. Moreover, the interaction between vectors and spinors that serves as the basis of
supersymmetric theories of physics in spacetimes of dimension 3, 4, 6 and 10 is just the action of
h2 (K) on K2 by matrix multiplication. In a Feynman diagram, this is represented as follows:
                                                              K2



                                       h2 (K)



                                                          K2
   In the case K = C, Penrose [77] has described a nice trick for getting points on the heavenly
sphere from spinors. In fact, it also works for other normed division algebras: if (x, y) ∈ K2 is
nonzero, the hermitian matrix
                                                             
                                  x                  xx∗ xy ∗
                                        x∗ y ∗ =
                                  y                   yx∗ yy ∗


                                                 29
is nonzero but has determinant zero, so it defines a point on the heavenly sphere. If we restrict to
spinors of norm one, this trick reduces to the Hopf map. Moreover, it clarifies the curious double role
of KP1 as both the heavenly sphere in special relativity and a space of propositions in the quantum
logic associated to the Jordan algebra h2 (K): any point on the heavenly sphere corresponds to a
proposition specifying the state of a spinor!

3.4    OP2 and the Exceptional Jordan Algebra
The octonions are fascinating in themselves, but the magic really starts when we use them to
construct the exceptional Jordan algebra h3 (O) and its associated projective space, the octonionic
projective plane. The symmetry groups of these structures turn out to be exceptional Lie groups, and
triality gains an eerie pervasive influence over the proceedings, since an element of h3 (O) consists of
3 octonions and 3 real numbers. Using the relation between normed division algebras and trialities,
we get an isomorphism

                                   h3 (O)           ∼
                                                    =     R3 ⊕ V8 ⊕ S8+ ⊕ S8−
                                              
                               α     z∗     y∗                                                      (7)
                              z     β      x  7→         ((α, β, γ), x, y, z)
                               y     x∗     γ

where α, β, γ ∈ R and x, y, z ∈ O. Examining the Jordan product in h3 (O) then reveals a wonderful
fact: while superficially this product is defined using the ∗-algebra structure of O, it can actually be
defined using only the natural maps

                      V8 × S8+ → S8− ,         V8 × S8− → S8+ ,       S8+ × S8− → V8

together with the inner products on these 3 spaces. All this information is contained in the normed
triality
                                      t8 : V8 × S8+ × S8− → R,
so any automorphism of this triality gives a automorphism of h3 (O). In Section 2.4 we saw that
Aut(t8 ) ∼
         = Spin(8). With a little thought, it follows that

                                          Spin(8) ⊆ Aut(h3 (O)).

    However, this picture of h3 (O) in terms of 8-dimensional Euclidean geometry is just part of a
bigger picture — a picture set in 10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime! If we regard h2 (O) as sitting
in the lower right-hand corner of h3 (O), we get an isomorphism

                                     h3 (O)        ∼
                                                   =      R ⊕ h2 (O) ⊕ O2
                                                                                                  (8)
                                     α    ψ∗
                                                   7→        (α, a, ψ)
                                     ψ    a

We saw in Section 3.3 that a ∈ h2 (O) and ψ ∈ O2 can be identified with a vector and a spinor in
10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, respectively. Similarly, α is a scalar.
   This picture gives a representation of Spin(9, 1) as linear transformations of h3 (O). Unfortunately,
most of these transformations do not preserve the Jordan product on h3 (O). As we shall see, they
only preserve a lesser structure on h3 (O): the determinant. However, the transformations coming
from the subgroup Spin(9) ⊂ Spin(9, 1) do preserve the Jordan product. We can see this as follows.
As a representation of Spin(9), h2 (O) splits into ‘space’ and ‘time’:

                                               h2 (O) ∼
                                                      = V9 ⊕ R


                                                     30
with the two pieces corresponding to the traceless elements of h2 (O) and the real multiples of the
identity, respectively. On the other hand, the spinor representation of so(9) splits as S8+ ⊕ S8− when
we restrict it to so(8), so we have
                                              O2 ∼= S9 .
We thus obtain an isomorphism

                                         h3 (O)           ∼
                                                          =   R2 ⊕ V9 ⊕ S9
                                                                                                (9)
                                     α      ψ∗
                                                         7→   ((α, β), a, ψ)
                                     ψ     a+β

where a ∈ h2 (O) has vanishing trace and β is a real multiple of the identity. In these terms, one can
easily check that the Jordan product in h3 (O) is built from invariant operations on scalars, vectors
and spinors in 9 dimensions. It follows that

                                          Spin(9) ⊆ Aut(h3 (O)).

For more details on this, see Harvey’s book [54].
   This does not exhaust all the symmetries of h3 (O), since there are other automorphisms coming
from the permutation group on 3 letters, which acts on (α, β, γ) ∈ R3 and (x, y, z) ∈ O3 in an
obvious way. Also, any matrix g ∈ O(3) acts by conjugation as an automorphism of h3 (O); since
the entries of g are real, there is no problem with nonassociativity here. The group Spin(9) is 36-
dimensional, but the full automorphism group h3 (O) is much bigger: it is 52-dimensional. As we
explain in Section 4.2, it goes by the name of F4 .
   However, we can already do something interesting with the automorphisms we have: we can use
them to diagonalize any element of h3 (O). To see this, first note that the rotation group, and thus
Spin(9), acts transitively on the unit sphere in V9 . This means we can use an automorphism in our
Spin(9) subgroup to bring any element of h3 (O) to the form
                                                          
                                              α z ∗ y∗
                                            z β x 
                                              y x∗ γ

where x is real. The next step is to apply an automorphism that makes y and z real while leaving x
alone. To do this, note that the subgroup of Spin(9) fixing any nonzero vector in V9 is isomorphic
to Spin(8). When we restrict the representation S9 to this subgroup, it splits as S8+ ⊕ S8− , and with
some work [54] one can show that Spin(8) acts on S8+ ⊕ S8− ∼  = O2 in such a way that any element
           2
(y, z) ∈ O can be carried to an element with both components real. The final step is to take our
element of h3 (O) with all real entries and use an automorphism to diagonalize it. We can do this by
conjugating it with a suitable matrix in O(3).
    To understand OP2 , we need to understand projections in h3 (O). Here is where our ability
to diagonalize matrices in h3 (O) via automorphisms comes in handy. Up to automorphism, every
projection in h3 (O) looks like one of these four:
                                                                                       
               0 0 0                   1 0 0               1 0 0                   1 0 0
       p0 =  0 0 0  , p1 =  0 0 0  , p2 =  0 1 0  , p3 =  0 1 0  .
               0 0 0                   0 0 0               0 0 0                   0 0 1

Now, the trace of a matrix in h3 (O) is invariant under automorphisms, because we can define it
using only the Jordan algebra structure:
                                            1
                                tr(a) =       tr(La ),           a ∈ h3 (O)
                                            9


                                                         31
where La is left multiplication by a. It follows that the trace of any projection in h3 (O) is 0,1,2, or
3. Furthermore, the rank of any projection p ∈ h3 (O) equals its trace. To see this, first note that
tr(p) ≥ rank(p), since p < q implies tr(p) < tr(q), and the trace goes up by integer steps. Thus we
only need show tr(p) ≤ rank(p). For this it suffices to consider the four projections shown above, as
both trace and rank are invariant under automorphisms. Since p0 < p1 < p2 < p3 , it is clear that
for these projections we indeed have tr(p) ≤ rank(p).
    It follows that the points of the octonionic projective plane are projections with trace 1 in h3 (O),
while the lines are projections with trace 2. A calculation [54] shows that any projection with trace
1 has the form                                                            
                                 x                         xx∗ xy ∗ xz ∗
                         p =  y  x∗ y ∗ z ∗ =  yx∗ yy ∗ yz ∗                                     (10)
                                  z                         zx∗ zy ∗ zz ∗
where (x, y, z) ∈ O3 has
                           (xy)z = x(yz),           kxk2 + kyk2 + kzk2 = 1.
On the other hand, any projection with trace 2 is of the form 1 − p where p has trace 1. This sets
up a one-to-one correspondence between points and lines in the octonionic projective plane. If we
use this correspondence to think of both as trace-1 projections, the point p lies on the line p′ if
and only if p < 1 − p′ . Of course, p < 1 − p′ iff p′ < 1 − p. The symmetry of this relation means
the octonionic projective plane is self-dual! This is also true of the real, complex and quaternionic
projective planes. In all cases, the operation that switches points and lines corresponds in quantum
logic to the ‘negation’ of propositions [98].
    We use OP2 to stand for the set of points in the octonionic projective plane. Given any nonzero
element (x, y, z) ∈ O3 with (xy)z = x(yz), we can normalize it and then use equation (10) to obtain
a point [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2 . Copying the strategy that worked for OP1 , we can make OP2 into a smooth
manifold by covering it with three coordinate charts:
   • one chart containing all points of the form [(x, y, 1)],
   • one chart containing all points of the form [(x, 1, z)],
   • one chart containing all points of the form [(1, y, z)].
Checking that this works is a simple calculation. The only interesting part is to make sure that
whenever the associative law might appear necessary, we can either use the alternativity of the
octonions or the fact that only triples with (xy)z = x(yz) give points [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2 .
   We thus obtain the following picture of the octonionic projective plane. As a manifold, OP2 is
16-dimensional. The lines in OP2 are copies of OP1 , and thus 8-spheres. For any two distinct points
in OP2 , there is a unique line on which they both lie. For any two distinct lines, there is a unique
point lying on both of them. There is a ‘duality’ transformation that maps points to lines and vice
versa while preserving this incidence relation. In particular, since the space of all points lying on
any given line is a copy of OP1 , so is the space of all lines containing a given point!
   To dig more deeply into the geometry of OP2 one needs another important structure on the
exceptional Jordan algebra: the determinant. We saw in Section 3.3 that despite noncommutativity
and nonassociativity, the determinant of a matrix in h2 (O) is a well-defined and useful concept. The
same holds for h3 (O)! We can define the determinant of a matrix in h3 (O) by
                                   
                       α z ∗ y∗
                det  z β x  = αβγ − (αkxk2 + βkyk2 + γkzk2) + 2Re(xyz).
                       y x∗ γ
We can express this in terms of the trace and product via
                                        1          1              1     3
                             det(a) =     tr(a3 ) − tr(a2 )tr(a) + tr(a) .
                                        3          2              6


                                                   32
This shows that the determinant is invariant under all automorphisms of h3 (O). However, the
determinant is invariant under an even bigger group of linear transformations. As we shall see in
Section 4.4, this group is 78-dimensional: it is a noncompact real form of the exceptional Lie group
E6 . This extra symmetry makes it worth seeing how much geometry we can do starting with just
the determinant and the vector space structure of h3 (O).
    The determinant is a cubic form on h3 (O), so there is a unique symmetric trilinear form

                                 (·, ·, ·): h3 (O) × h3 (O) × h3 (O) → R

such that
                                          (a, a, a) = det(a).
By dualizing this, we obtain the so-called cross product

                                     ×: h3 (O) × h3 (O) → h3 (O)∗ .

Explicitly, this is given by
                                         (a × b)(c) = (a, b, c).
Despite its name, this product is commutative.
    We have already seen that points of OP2 correspond to trace-1 projections in h3 (O). Freudenthal
[40] noticed that these are the same as elements p ∈ h3 (O) with tr(p) = 1 and p × p = 0. Even
better, we can drop the equation tr(p) = 1 as long as we promise to work with equivalence classes of
nonzero elements satisfying p × p = 0, where two such elements are equivalent when one is a nonzero
real multiple of the other. Each such equivalence class [p] corresponds to a unique point of OP2 , and
we get all the points this way.
    Given two points [p] and [q], their cross product p×q is well-defined up to a nonzero real multiple.
This suggests that we define a ‘line’ to be an equivalence class of elements p×q ∈ h3 (O)∗ , where again
two such elements are deemed equivalent if one is a nonzero real multiple of the other. Freudenthal
showed that we get a projective plane isomorphic to OP2 if we take these as our definitions of points
and lines and decree that the point [p] lies on the line [L] if and only if L(p) = 0. Note that this
equation makes sense even though L and p are only well-defined up to nonzero real multiples.
    One consequence of all this is that one can recover the structure of OP2 as a projective plane
starting from just the determinant on h3 (O): we did not need the Jordan algebra structure! However,
to get a ‘duality’ map switching points and lines while preserving the incidence relation, we need a
bit more: we need the nondegenerate pairing

                                            ha, bi = tr(ab)

on h3 (O). This sets up an isomorphism

                                           h3 (O) ∼
                                                  = h3 (O)∗ .

This isomorphism turns out to map points to lines, and in fact, it sets up a one-to-one correspondence
between points and lines. We can use this correspondence to think of both points and lines in
OP2 as equivalence classes of elements of h3 (O). In these terms, the point p lies on the line ℓ iff
hℓ, pi = 0. This relationship is symmetrical! It follows that if we switch points and lines using this
correspondence, the incidence relation is preserved.
    We thus obtain a very pretty setup for working with OP2 . If we use the isomorphism between
h3 (O) and its dual to reinterpret the cross product as a map

                                     ×: h3 (O) × h3 (O) → h3 (O),

then not only is the line through distinct points [p] and [q] given by [p × q], but also the point in
which two distinct lines [ℓ] and [m] meet is given by [ℓ × m]. A triple of points [p], [q] and [r] is


                                                   33
collinear iff (p, q, r) = 0, and a triple of lines [ℓ], [m], [n] meets at a point iff (ℓ, m, n) = 0. In
addition, there is a delightful bunch of identities relating the Jordan product, the determinant, the
cross product and the inner product in h3 (O).
    For more on octonionic geometry, the reader is urged to consult the original papers by Freudenthal
[39, 40, 41, 42], Jacques Tits [94, 95] and Tonny Springer [87, 88, 89]. The book by Helmut Salzmann
et al is also good [82]. Unfortunately, we must now bid goodbye to this subject and begin our trip
through the exceptional groups. However, we shall return to study the symmetries of OP2 and the
exceptional Jordan algebra in Sections 4.2 and 4.4.


4    Exceptional Lie Algebras
On October 18th, 1887, Wilhelm Killing wrote a letter to Friedrich Engel saying that he had classified
the simple Lie algebras. In the next three years, this revolutionary work was published in a series of
papers [63]. Besides what we now call the ‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, he claimed to have found
6 ‘exceptional’ ones — new mathematical objects whose existence had never before been suspected.
In fact he gave a rigorous construction of only the smallest of these. In his 1894 thesis, Cartan [14]
constructed all of them and noticed that the two 52-dimensional exceptional Lie algebras discovered
by Killing were isomorphic, so that there are really only 5.
    The Killing-Cartan classification of simple Lie algebras introduced much of the technology that
is now covered in any introductory course on the subject, such as roots and weights. In what follows
we shall avoid this technology, since we wish instead to see the exceptional Lie algebras as octonionic
relatives of the classical ones — slightly eccentric relatives, but still having a close connection to
geometry, in particular the Riemannian geometry of projective planes. It is also for this reason that
we shall focus on the compact real forms of the simple Lie algebras.
    The classical simple Lie algebras can be organized in three infinite families:

                            so(n)   = {x ∈ R[n]: x∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},
                            su(n)   = {x ∈ C[n]: x∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},
                            sp(n)   = {x ∈ H[n]: x∗ = −x}.

The corresponding Lie groups are

                           SO(n) =      {x ∈ R[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},
                           SU(n) =      {x ∈ C[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},
                           Sp(n) =      {x ∈ H[n]: xx∗ = 1}.

These arise naturally as symmetry groups of projective spaces over R, C, and H, respectively. More
precisely, they arise as groups of isometries: transformations that preserve a specified Riemannian
metric. Let us sketch how this works, as a warmup for the exceptional groups.
   First consider the projective space RPn . We can think of this as the unit sphere in Rn+1 with
antipodal points x and −x identified. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric from the sphere, and
the obvious action of the rotation group O(n + 1) as isometries of the sphere yields an action of this
group as isometries of RPn with this metric. In fact, with this metric, the group of all isometries of
RPn is just
                                      Isom(RPn ) ∼
                                                 = O(n + 1)/O(1)
where O(1) = {±1} is the subgroup of O(n + 1) that acts trivially on RPn . The Lie algebra of this
isometry group is
                                   isom(RPn ) ∼
                                              = so(n + 1).
   The case of CPn is very similar. We can think of this as the unit sphere in Cn+1 with points
x and αx identified whenever α is a unit complex number. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric



                                                  34
from this sphere, and the unitary group U(n + 1) acts as isometries. If we consider only the con-
nected component of the isometry group and ignore the orientation-reversing isometries coming from
complex conjugation, we have
                                  Isom0 (CPn ) ∼
                                               = U(n + 1)/U(1)
where U(1) is the subgroup that acts trivially on CPn . The Lie algebra of this isometry group is

                                        isom(CPn ) ∼
                                                   = su(n + 1).

    The case of HPn is subtler, since we must take the noncommutativity of the quaternions into
account. We can think of HPn as the unit sphere in Hn+1 with points x and αx identified whenever
α is a unit quaternion, and as before, HPn inherits a Riemannian metric. The group Sp(n + 1) acts
as isometries of HPn , but this action comes from right multiplication, so

                                    Isom(HPn ) ∼
                                               = Sp(n + 1)/{±1},

since not Sp(1) but only its center {±1} acts trivially on HPn by right multiplication. At the Lie
algebra level, this gives
                                     isom(HPn ) ∼= sp(n + 1).
    For lovers of the octonions, it is tempting to try a similar construction starting with OP2 . While
nonassociativity makes things a bit tricky, we show in Section 4.2 that it can in fact be done. It
turns out that Isom(OP2 ) is one of the exceptional Lie groups, namely F4 . Similarly, the exceptional
Lie groups E6 , E7 and E8 are in a certain subtle sense the isometry groups of projective planes over
the algebras C ⊗ O, H ⊗ O and O ⊗ O. Together with F4 , these groups can all be defined by the
so-called ‘magic square’ construction, which makes use of much of the algebra we have described so
far. We explain three versions of this construction in Section 4.3. We then treat the groups E6 , E7
and E8 individually in the following sections. But first, we must introduce G2 : the smallest of the
exceptional Lie groups, and none other than the automorphism group of the octonions.

4.1    G2
In 1914, Élie Cartan noted that the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups, G2 , is the automorphism
group of the octonions [15]. Its Lie algebra g2 is therefore der(O), the derivations of the octonions.
Let us take these facts as definitions of G2 and its Lie algebra, and work out some of the consequences.
      What are automorphisms of the octonions like? One way to analyze this involves subalgebras of
the octonions. Any octonion e1 whose square is −1 generates a subalgebra of O isomorphic to C.
If we then pick any octonion e2 with square equal to −1 that anticommutes with e1 , the elements
e1 , e2 generate a subalgebra isomorphic to H. Finally, if we pick any octonion e3 with square equal
to −1 that anticommutes with e1 , e2 , and e1 e2 , the elements e1 , e2 , e3 generate all of O. We call
such a triple of octonions a basic triple. Given any basic triple, there exists a unique way to define
e4 , . . . , e7 so that the whole multiplication table in Section 2 holds. In fact, this follows from the
remarks on the Cayley–Dickson construction at the end of Section 2.3.
      It follows that given any two basic triples, there exists a unique automorphism of O mapping
the first to the second. Conversely, it is obvious that any automorphism maps basic triples to basic
triples. This gives a nice description of the group G2 , as follows.
      Fix a basic triple e1 , e2 , e3 . There is a unique automorphism of the octonions mapping this to
any other basic triple, say e′1 , e′2 , e′3 . Now our description of basic triples so far has been purely
algebraic, but we can also view them more geometrically as follows: a basic triple is any triple of
unit imaginary octonions (i.e. imaginary octonions of norm one) such that each is orthogonal to the
algebra generated by the other two. This means that our automorphism can map e1 to any point
e′1 on the 6-sphere of unit imaginary octonions, then map e2 to any point e′2 on the 5-sphere of unit



                                                   35
imaginary octonions that are orthogonal to e′1 , and then map e3 to any point e′3 on the 3-sphere of
unit imaginary octonions that are orthogonal to e′1 , e′2 and e′1 e′2 . It follows that

                             dim G2 = dim S 6 + dim S 5 + dim S 3 = 14.

   The triality description of the octonions in Section 2.4 gives another picture of G2 . First, recall
that Spin(8) is the automorphism group of the triality t8 : V8 × S8+ × S8− → R. To construct the
octonions from this triality we need to pick unit vectors in any two of these spaces, so we can think
of G2 as the subgroup of Spin(8) fixing unit vectors in V8 and S8+ . The subgroup of Spin(8) fixing
a unit vector in V8 is just Spin(7), and when we restrict the representation S8+ to Spin(7), we get
the spinor representation S7 . Thus G2 is the subgroup of Spin(7) fixing a unit vector in S7 . Since
Spin(7) acts transitively on the unit sphere S 7 in this spinor representation [2], we have

                                          Spin(7)/G2 = S 7 .

It follows that
                          dim G2 = dim(Spin(7)) − dim S 7 = 21 − 7 = 14.
    This picture becomes a bit more vivid if we remember that after choosing unit vectors in V8
and S8+ , we can identify both these representations with the octonions, with both unit vectors
corresponding to 1 ∈ O. Thus what we are really saying is this: the subgroup of Spin(8) that fixes
1 in the vector representation on O is Spin(7); the subgroup that fixes 1 in both the vector and
right-handed spinor representations is G2 . This subgroup also fixes the element 1 in the left-handed
spinor representation of Spin(8) on O.
    Now, using the vector representation of Spin(8) on O, we get homomorphisms

                                      G2 ֒→ Spin(8) → SO(O)

where SO(O) ∼   = SO(8) is the rotation group of the octonions, viewed as a real vector space with
the inner product hx, yi = Re(x∗ y). The map from Spin(8) to SO(O) is two-to-one, but when we
restrict it to G2 we get a one-to-one map

                                            G2 ֒→ SO(O).

   At the Lie algebra level, this construction gives an inclusion

                                             g2 ֒→ so(O)

where so(O) ∼ = so(8) is the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the octonions.
Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(O) is 28-dimensional, it is nice to see exactly where the extra
14 dimensions come from. In fact, they come from two copies of Im(O), the 7-dimensional space
consisting of all imaginary octonions.
   More precisely, we have:
                                    so(O) = g2 ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O)                                  (11)
(a direct sum of vector spaces, not Lie algebras), where LIm(O) is the space of linear transformations
of O given by left multiplication by imaginary octonions and RIm(O) is the space of linear transfor-
mations of O given by right multiplication by imaginary octonions [84]. To see this, we first check
that left multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. Using polarization, it suffices to
note that

           hx, axi = Re(x∗ (ax)) = Re((x∗ a)x) = Re((a∗ x)∗ x) = −Re((ax)∗ x) = −hax, xi

for all a ∈ Im(O) and x ∈ O. Note that this calculation only uses the alternative law, not the
associative law, since x, x∗ and a all lie in the algebra generated by the two elements a and Im(x).


                                                  36
A similar argument shows that right multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. It
follows that g2 , LIm(O) and RIm(O) all naturally lie in so(8). Next, with some easy calculations we
can check that
                                        LIm(O) ∩ RIm(O) = {0}
and
                                    g2 ∩ (LIm(O) + RIm(O) ) = {0}.
Using the fact that the dimensions of the 3 pieces adds to 28, equation (11) follows.
     We have seen that G2 sits inside SO(8), but we can do better: it actually sits inside SO(7). After
all, every automorphism of the octonions fixes the identity, and thus preserves the space of octonions
orthogonal to the identity. This space is just Im(O), so we have an inclusion

                                          G2 ֒→ SO(Im(O))

where SO(Im(O)) ∼    = SO(7) is the rotation group of the imaginary octonions. At the Lie algebra
level this gives an inclusion
                                          g2 ֒→ so(Im(O)).
   Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(Im(O)) is 21-dimensional, it is nice to see where the 7 extra
dimensions come from. Examining equation (11), it is clear that these extra dimensions must come
from the transformations in LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O) that annihilate the identity 1 ∈ O. The transformations
that do this are precisely those of the form

                                           ada = La − Ra

for a ∈ Im(O). We thus have
                                   so(Im(O)) ∼
                                             = der(O) ⊕ adIm(O)                                   (12)
where adIm(O) is the 7-dimensional space of such transformations.
   We may summarize some of the above results as follows:

Theorem 4. The compact real form of the Lie algebra g2 is given by

                                 g2 = der(O) ⊂ so(Im(O)) ⊂ so(O)

and we have

                             so(Im(O))    = der(O) ⊕ adIm(O)
                                  so(O) = der(O) ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O)

where the Lie brackets in so(Im(O)) and so(O) are built from natural bilinear operations on the
summands.

   As we have seen, G2 has a 7-dimensional representation Im(O). In fact, this is the smallest
nontrivial representation of G2 , so it is worth understanding in as many ways as possible. The
space Im(O) has at least three natural structures that are preserved by the transformations in G2 .
These give more descriptions of G2 as a symmetry group, and they also shed some new light on the
octonions. The first two of the structures we describe are analogous to more familiar ones that exist
on the 3-dimensional space of imaginary quaternions, Im(H). The third makes explicit use of the
nonassociativity of the octonions.
   First, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the commutator. In the case of Im(H), the
commutator divided by 2 is the familiar cross product in 3 dimensions:
                                                    1
                                           a×b=       [a, b].
                                                    2


                                                  37
We can make the same definition for Im(O), obtaining a 7-dimensional analog of the cross product.
For both Im(H) and Im(O) the cross product is bilinear and anticommutative. The cross product
makes Im(H) into a Lie algebra, but not Im(O). For both Im(H) and Im(O), the cross product has
two nice geometrical properties. On the one hand, its norm is determined by the formula
                                    ka × bk2 + ha, bi2 = kak2 kbk2 ,
or equivalently,
                                        ka × bk = |sin θ| kak kbk,
where θ is the angle between a and b. On the other hand, a × b is orthogonal to a and b. Both these
properties follow from easy calculations. For Im(H), these two properties are enough to determine
x × y up to a sign. For Im(O) they are not — but they become so if we also use the fact that x × y
lies inside a copy of Im(H) that contains x and y.
    It is clear that the group of all real-linear transformations of Im(H) preserving the cross product
is just SO(3), which is also the automorphism group of the quaternions. One can similarly show
that the group of real-linear transformations of Im(O) preserving the cross product is exactly G2 .
To see this, start by noting that any element of G2 preserves the cross product on Im(O), since the
cross product is defined using octonion multiplication. To show that conversely any transformation
preserving the cross product lies in G2 , it suffices to express the multiplication of imaginary octonions
in terms of their cross product. Using this identity:
                                           a × b = ab + ha, bi,
it actually suffices to express the inner product on Im(O) in terms of the cross product. Here the
following identity does the job:
                                       ha, bi = − 16 tr(a × (b × · ))                         (13)
where the right-hand side refers to the trace of the map
                                     a × (b × · ): Im(O) → Im(O).
    Second, both Im(H) and Im(O) are equipped with a natural 3-form, or in other words, an
alternating trilinear functional. This is given by
                                          φ(x, y, z) = hx, yzi.
In the case of Im(H) this is just the usual volume form, and the group of real-linear transformations
preserving it is SL(3, R). In the case of Im(O), the real-linear transformations preserving φ are
exactly those in the group G2 . A proof of this by Robert Bryant can be found in Reese Harvey’s
book [54]. The 3-form φ is important in the theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’ [60], which are 7-dimensional
Riemannian manifolds with holonomy group equal to G2 .
    Third, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the associator. For Im(H) this is boring, since
the associator vanishes. On the other hand, for Im(O) the associator is interesting. In fact, it
follows from results of Harvey [54] that a real-linear transformation T : Im(O) → Im(O) preserves
the associator if and only if ±T lies in G2 . Thus the symmetry group of the associator is slightly
bigger than G2 : it is G2 × Z2 .
    Now we must make an embarrassing admission: these three structures on Im(O) are all almost
the same thing! Starting with the cross product
                                     ×: Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O)
we can recover the usual inner product on Im(O) by equation (13). This inner product allows us
to dualize the cross product and obtain a trilinear functional, which is, up to a constant, just the
3-form
                                φ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.


                                                   38
The cross product also determines an orientation on Im(O) (we leave this as an exercise for the
reader). This allows us to take the Hodge dual of φ, obtaining a 4-form ψ, i.e. an alternating
tetralinear functional
                           ψ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.
Dualizing yet again, this gives a ternary operation which, up to a constant multiple, is the associator:

                              [·, ·, ·]: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O).

   We conclude this section with a handy explicit formula for all the derivations of the octonions.
In an associative algebra A, any element x defines an inner derivation adx : A → A by

                                             adx (a) = [x, a]

where the bracket denotes the commutator xa−ax. In a nonassociative algebra, this formula usually
does not define a derivation. However, if A is alternative, any pair of elements x, y ∈ A define a
derivation Dx,y : A → A by
                                  Dx,y a = [[x, y], a] − 3[x, y, a]                           (14)
where [a, b, x] denotes the associator (ab)x − a(bx). Moreover, when A is a normed division algebra,
every derivation is a linear combination of derivations of this form. Unfortunately, proving these
facts seems to require some brutal calculations [84].

4.2    F4
The second smallest of the exceptional Lie groups is the 52-dimensional group F4 . The geometric
meaning of this group became clear in a number of nearly simultaneous papers by various mathe-
maticians. In 1949, Jordan constructed the octonionic projective plane using projections in h3 (O).
One year later, Armand Borel [10] noted that F4 is the isometry group of a 16-dimensional projec-
tive plane. In fact, this plane is none other than than OP2 . Also in 1950, Claude Chevalley and
Richard Schafer [21] showed that F4 is the automorphism group of h3 (O). In 1951, Freudenthal
[39] embarked upon a long series of papers in which he described not only F4 but also the other
exceptional Lie groups using octonionic projective geometry. To survey these developments, one still
cannot do better than to read his classic 1964 paper on Lie groups and the foundations of geometry
[42].
    Let us take Chevalley and Schafer’s result as the definition of F4 :

                                            F4 = Aut(h3 (O)).

Its Lie algebra is thus
                                            f4 = der(h3 (O)).
                                        2
As we saw in Section 3.4, points of OP correspond to trace-1 projections in the exceptional Jordan
algebra. It follows that F4 acts as transformations of OP2 . In fact, we can equip OP2 with a
Riemannian metric for which F4 is the isometry group. To get a sense of how this works, let us
describe OP2 as a quotient space of F4 .
    In Section 3.4 we saw that the exceptional Jordan algebra can be built using natural operations
on the scalar, vector and spinor representations of Spin(9). This implies that Spin(9) is a subgroup
of F4 . Equation (9) makes it clear that Spin(9) is precisely the subgroup fixing the element
                                                       
                                              1 0 0
                                            0 0 0 .
                                              0 0 0




                                                   39
Since this element is a trace-one projection, it corresponds to a point of OP2 . We have already seen
that F4 acts transitively on OP2 . It follows that

                                         OP2 ∼
                                             = F4 /Spin(9).                                       (15)

   This fact has various nice spinoffs. First, it gives an easy way to compute the dimension of F4 :

                       dim(F4 ) = dim(Spin(9)) + dim(OP2 ) = 36 + 16 = 52.

Second, since F4 is compact, we can take any Riemannian metric on OP2 and average it with respect
to the action of this group. The isometry group of the resulting metric will automatically include
F4 as a subgroup. With more work [6], one can show that actually

                                           F4 = Isom(OP2 )

and thus
                                           f4 = isom(OP2 ).
     Equation (15) also implies that the tangent space of our chosen point in OP2 is isomorphic to
f4 /so(9). But we already know that this tangent space is just O2 , or in other words, the spinor
representation of so(9). We thus have

                                           f4 ∼
                                              = so(9) ⊕ S9                                        (16)

as vector spaces, where so(9) is a Lie subalgebra. The bracket in f4 is built from the bracket in
so(9), the action so(9) ⊗ S9 → S9 , and the map S9 ⊗ S9 → so(9) obtained by dualizing this action.
We can also rewrite this description of f4 in terms of the octonions, as follows:

                                        f4 ∼
                                           = so(O ⊕ R) ⊕ O2

   This last formula suggests that we decompose f4 further using the splitting of O ⊕ R into O and
R. It is easily seen by looking at matrices that for all n, m we have

                              so(n + m) ∼
                                        = so(n) ⊕ so(m) ⊕ Vn ⊗ Vm .                               (17)

Moreover, when we restrict the representation S9 to so(8), it splits as a direct sum S8+ ⊕ S8− . Using
these facts and equation (16), we see

                                     f4 ∼
                                        = so(8) ⊕ V8 ⊕ S8+ ⊕ S8−                                  (18)

This formula emphasizes the close relation between f4 and triality: the Lie bracket in f4 is completely
built out of maps involving so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible representations! We can
rewrite this in a way that brings out the role of the octonions:

                                           f4 ∼
                                              = so(O) ⊕ O3

    While elegant, none of these descriptions of f4 gives a convenient picture of all the derivations
of the exceptional Jordan algebra. In fact, there is a nice picture of this sort for h3 (K) whenever K
is a normed division algebra. One way to get a derivation of the Jordan algebra h3 (K) is to take a
derivation of K and let it act on each entry of the matrices in h3 (K). Another way uses elements of

                             sa3 (K) = {x ∈ K[3]: x∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.

Given x ∈ sa3 (K), there is a derivation adx of h3 (K) given by

                                           adx (a) = [x, a].


                                                  40
In fact [5], every derivation of h3 (K) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of derivations
of these two sorts, so we have
                                      der(h3 (K)) ∼
                                                  = der(K) ⊕ sa3 (K)                                (19)
as vector spaces. In the case of the octonions, this decomposition says that

                                            f4 ∼
                                               = g2 ⊕ sa3 (O).

   In equation (19), the subspace der(K) is always a Lie subalgebra, but sa3 (K) is not unless K is
commutative and associative — in which case der(K) vanishes. Nonetheless, there is a formula for
the brackets in der(h3 (K)) which applies in every case [75]. Given D, D′ ∈ der(K) and x, y ∈ sa3 (K),
we have
                              [D, D′ ]     = DD′ − D′ D
                              [D, adx ]    = adDx
                                                          1 X
                                                               3                                  (20)
                              [adx , ady ] = ad[x,y]0 +           Dxij ,yij
                                                          3 i,j=1

where D acts on x componentwise, [x, y]0 is the trace-free part of the commutator [x, y], and Dxij ,yij
is the derivation of K defined using equation (14).
    Summarizing these different descriptions of f4 , we have:
Theorem 5. The compact real form of f4 is given by

                                       f4   ∼
                                            = isom(OP2 )
                                            ∼
                                            = der(h3 (O))
                                            ∼
                                            = der(O) ⊕ sa3 (O)
                                            ∼
                                            = so(O ⊕ R) ⊕ O2
                                            ∼
                                            = so(O) ⊕ O3

where in each case the Lie bracket is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.

4.3    The Magic Square
Around 1956, Boris Rosenfeld [79] had the remarkable idea that just as F4 is the isometry group of
the projective plane over the octonions, the exceptional Lie groups E6 , E7 and E8 are the isometry
groups of projective planes over the following three algebras, respectively:
   • the bioctonions, C ⊗ O,
   • the quateroctonions, H ⊗ O,
   • the octooctonions, O ⊗ O.
There is definitely something right about this idea, because one would expect these projective planes
to have dimensions 32, 64, and 128, and there indeed do exist compact Riemannian manifolds with
these dimensions having E6 , E7 and E8 as their isometry groups. The problem is that the bioctonions,
quateroctonions and and octooctonions are not division algebras, so it is a nontrivial matter to define
projective planes over them!
    The situation is not so bad for the bioctonions: h3 (C ⊗ O) is a simple Jordan algebra, though not
a formally real one, and one can use this to define (C ⊗ O)P2 in a manner modeled after one of the
constructions of OP2 . Rosenfeld claimed that a similar construction worked for the quateroctonions
and octooctonions, but this appears to be false. Among other problems, h3 (H ⊗ O) and h3 (O ⊗ O)
do not become Jordan algebras under the product a ◦ b = 12 (ab + ba). Scattered throughout the



                                                   41
literature [6, 42, 43] one can find frustrated comments about the lack of a really nice construction
of (H ⊗ O)P2 and (O ⊗ O)P2 . One problem is that these spaces do not satisfy the usual axioms
for a projective plane. Tits addressed this problem in his theory of ‘buildings’, which allows one
to construct a geometry having any desired algebraic group as symmetries [97]. But alas, it still
seems that the quickest way to get our hands on the quateroctonionic and octooctonionic ‘projective
planes’ is by starting with the Lie groups E7 and E8 and then taking quotients by suitable subgroups.
    In short, more work must be done before we can claim to fully understand the geometrical
meaning of the Lie groups E6 , E7 and E8 . Luckily, Rosenfeld’s ideas can be used to motivate a
nice construction of their Lie algebras. This goes by the name of the ‘magic square’. Tits [96] and
Freudenthal [41] found two very different versions of this construction in about 1958, but we shall
start by presenting a simplified version published by E. B. Vinberg [99] in 1966.
    First consider the projective plane KP2 when K is a normed division algebra K. The points of this
plane are the rank-1 projections in the Jordan algebra h3 (K), and this plane admits a Riemannian
metric such that
                                        isom(KP2 ) ∼
                                                   = der(h3 (K)).
Moreover, we have seen in equation (19) that

                                    der(h3 (K)) ∼
                                                = der(K) ⊕ sa3 (K).

Combined with Rosenfeld’s observations, these facts might lead one to hope that whenever we have
a pair of normed division algebras K and K′ , there is a Riemannian manifold (K ⊗ K′ )P2 with

                        isom((K ⊗ K′ )P2 ) ∼
                                           = der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) ⊕ sa3 (K ⊗ K′ )

where for any ∗-algebra A we define

                            shn (A) =     {x ∈ A[n]: x∗ = x, tr(x) = 0}
                            san (A) =     {x ∈ A[n]: x∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.

   This motivated Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras:

                             M(K, K′ ) = der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) ⊕ sa3 (K ⊗ K′ ).

Now, when K ⊗ K′ is commutative and associative, sa3 (K ⊗ K′) is a Lie algebra with the commutator
as its Lie bracket, but in the really interesting cases it is not. Thus to make M(K, K′ ) into a Lie
algebra we must give it a rather subtle bracket. We have already seen the special case K′ = R in
equation (20). In general, the Lie bracket in M(K, K′ ) is given as follows:
  1. der(K) and der(K′ ) are commuting Lie subalgebras of M(K, K′ ).
  2. The bracket of D ∈ der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) with x ∈ sa3 (K ⊗ K′ ) is given by applying D to every
     entry of the matrix x, using the natural action of der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) as derivations of K ⊗ K′ .
  3. Given X, Y ∈ sa3 (K ⊗ K′ ),
                                                                3
                                                            1X
                                     [X, Y ] = [X, Y ]0 +           DXij ,Yij .
                                                            3 i,j=1

     Here [X, Y ]0 is the traceless part of the 3 × 3 matrix [X, Y ], and given x, y ∈ K ⊗ K′ we define
     Dx,y ∈ der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) in the following way: Dx,y is real-bilinear in x and y, and

                                   Da⊗a′ ,b⊗b′ = ha′ , b′ iDa,b + ha, biDa′ ,b′

     where a, b ∈ K, a′ , b′ ∈ K′ , and Da,b , Da′ ,b′ are defined as in equation (14).


                                                    42
With this construction we magically obtain the following square of Lie algebras:


                                    K′ = R        K′ = C           K′ = H      K′ = O
                          K=R        so(3)            su(3)            sp(3)     f4
                          K=C        su(3)     su(3) ⊕ su(3)           su(6)     e6
                          K=H        sp(3)            su(6)        so(12)        e7
                          K=O         f4               e6               e7       e8

                           Table 5 — Magic Square Lie Algebras M(K, K′ )

We will mainly be interested in the last row (or column), which is the one involving the octonions.
In this case we can take the magic square construction as defining the Lie algebras f4 , e6 , e7 and e8 .
This definition turns out to be consistent with our earlier definition of f4 .
    Starting from Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras, we can easily recover Tits’
original definition. To do so, we need two facts. First,

                             sa3 (K ⊗ K′ ) ∼
                                           = sa3 (K′ ) ⊕ (Im(K)⊗sh3 (K′ )).

This is easily seen by direct examination of the relevant matrices. Second,

                                     der(h3 (K)) ∼
                                                 = der(K) ⊕ sa3 (K)

as vector spaces. This is just equation (19). Starting with Vinberg’s definition and applying these
two facts, we obtain

                  M(K, K′ ) =      der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) ⊕ sa3 (K ⊗ K′ )
                            ∼
                            =      der(K) ⊕ der(K′ ) ⊕ sa3 (K′ ) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3 (K′ ))
                            ∼
                            =      der(K) ⊕ der(h3 (K′ )) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3 (K′ )).

The last line is Tits’ definition of the magic square Lie algebras. Unlike Vinberg’s, it is not manifestly
symmetrical in K and K′ . This unhappy feature is somewhat made up for by the fact that der(K) ⊕
der(h3 (K′ )) is a nice big Lie subalgebra. This subalgebra acts on Im(K) ⊗ sh3 (K′ ) in an obvious way,
using the fact that any derivation of K maps Im(K) to itself, and any derivation of h3 (K′ ) maps
sh3 (K′ ) to itself. However, the bracket of two elements of (Im(K) ⊗ sh3 (K′ )) is a bit of a mess.
    Yet another description of the magic square was recently given by Barton and Sudbery [5]. This
one emphasizes the role of trialities. Let tri(K) be the Lie algebra of the group Aut(t), where t is
the normed triality giving the normed division algebra K. From equation (5) we have

                                             tri(R)    ∼
                                                       =      {0}
                                             tri(C)    ∼
                                                       =      u(1)2
                                                       ∼                                             (21)
                                             tri(H)    =      sp(1)3
                                             tri(O)    ∼
                                                       =      so(8).

To express the magic square in terms of these Lie algebras, we need three facts. First, it is easy to
see that
                                       sh3 (K) ∼
                                               = K 3 ⊕ R2 .
Second, Barton and Sudbery show that as vector spaces,

                                       der(h3 (K)) ∼
                                                   = tri(K) ⊕ K3 .




                                                       43
This follows in a case–by–case way from equation (21), but they give a unified proof that covers all
cases. Third, they show that as vector spaces,

                                     tri(K) ∼
                                            = der(K) ⊕ Im(K)2 .

Now starting with Tits’ definition of the magic square, applying the first two facts, regrouping terms,
and applying the third fact, we obtain Barton and Sudbery’s version of the magic square:

                    M(K, K′ ) ∼
                              =     der(K) ⊕ der(h3 (K′ )) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3 (K′ ))
                              ∼
                              =     der(K) ⊕ tri(K′ ) ⊕ K′3 ⊕ Im(K)⊗(K′3 ⊕ R2 )
                              ∼
                              =     der(K) ⊕ Im(K)2 ⊕ tri(K′ ) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′ )3
                              ∼
                              =     tri(K) ⊕ tri(K′ ) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′ )3 .

   In the next three sections we use all these different versions of the magic square to give lots of
octonionic descriptions of e6 , e7 and e8 . To save space, we usually omit the formulas for the Lie
bracket in these descriptions. However, the patient reader can reconstruct these with the help of
Barton and Sudbery’s paper, which is packed with useful formulas.
   As we continue our tour through the exceptional Lie algebras, we shall make contact with Adams’
work [2] constructing f4 , e6 , e7 , and e8 with the help of spinors and rotation group Lie algebras:

                                    f4   ∼
                                         =     so(9) ⊕ S9
                                    e6   ∼
                                         =     so(10) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ S10
                                    e7   ∼
                                         =                       +
                                               so(12) ⊕ sp(1) ⊕ S12
                                    e8   ∼
                                         =                +
                                               so(16) ⊕ S16

as vector spaces. Note that the numbers 9, 10, 12 and 16 are 8 more than the dimensions of R, C, H
and O. As usual, this is no coincidence! In terms of the octonions, Bott periodicity implies that

                                          Sn+8 ∼
                                               = Sn ⊗ O 2 .

This gives the following description of spinors in dimensions ≤ 16:

                                      S1 = R       S9 = O2
                                      S2 = C       S10 = (C ⊗ O)2
                                      S3 = H       S11 = (H ⊗ O)2
                                      S4± = H       ±
                                                   S12 = (H ⊗ O)2
                                      S5 = H2      S13 = (H2 ⊗ O)2
                                               4
                                      S6 = C       S14 = (C4 ⊗ O)2
                                      S7 = O       S15 = (O ⊗ O)2
                                      S8± = O       ±
                                                   S16 = (O ⊗ O)2

                            Table 6 — Spinor Representations Revisited

Since spinors in dimensions 1,2,4 and 8 are isomorphic to the division algebras R, C, H and O, spinors
in dimensions 8 higher are isomorphic to the ‘planes’ O2 , (C ⊗ O)2 , (H ⊗ O)2 and (O ⊗ O)2 — and
are thus closely linked to f4 , e6 , e7 and e8 , thanks to the magic square.

4.4    E6
We begin with the 78-dimensional exceptional Lie group E6 . As we mentioned in Section 3.4, there
is a nice description of a certain noncompact real form of E6 as the group of collineations of OP2 , or


                                                    44
equivalently, the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of h3 (O). But before going
into these, we consider the magic square constructions of the Lie algebra e6 . Vinberg’s construction
gives
                                     e6 = der(O) ⊕ sa3 (C ⊗ O).
Tits’ construction, which is asymmetrical, gives

                                      e6 ∼
                                         = der(h3 (O)) ⊕ sh3 (O)

and also
                           e6 ∼
                              = der(O) ⊕ der(h3 (C)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3 (C)).
The Barton-Sudbery construction gives

                                  e6 ∼
                                     = tri(O) ⊕ tri(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)3 .

We can use any of these to determine the dimension of e6 . For example, we have

                     dim(e6 ) = dim(der(h3 (O))) + dim(sh3 (O)) = 52 + 26 = 78.

    Starting from the Barton-Sudbery construction and using the concrete descriptions of tri(O) and
tri(C) from equation (21), we obtain

                              e6 ∼
                                 = so(O) ⊕ so(C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)3

Using equation (17), we may rewrite this as

                                e6 ∼
                                   = so(O ⊕ C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)2

and it turns out that the summand so(O ⊕ C) ⊕ Im(C) is actually a Lie subalgebra of e6 . This result
can also be found in Adams’ book [2], phrased as follows:

                                      e6 ∼
                                         = so(10) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ S10

In fact, he describes the bracket in e6 in terms of natural operations involving so(10) and its spinor
representation S10 . The funny-looking factor of u(1) comes from the fact that this spinor represen-
tation is complex. The bracket of an element of u(1) and an element of S10 is another element of
S10 , defined using the obvious action of u(1) on this complex vector space.
    If we define E6 to be the simply connected group with Lie algebra e6 , it follows from results of
Adams that the subgroup generated by the Lie subalgebra so(10) ⊕ u(1) is isomorphic to (Spin(10) ×
U(1))/Z4 . This lets us define the bioctonionic projective plane by

                             (C ⊗ O)P2 = E6 / ((Spin(10) × U(1))/Z4 )

and conclude that the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S10 ∼
                                                                                       = (C ⊗ O)2 .
   Since E6 is compact, we can put an E6 -invariant Riemannian metric on the bioctonionic projective
plane by averaging any metric with respect to the action of this group. It turns out [6] that the
isometry group of this metric is exactly E6 , so we have

                                       E6 ∼
                                          = Isom((C ⊗ O)P2 ).

It follows that
                                       e6 ∼
                                          = isom((C ⊗ O)P2 ).
   Summarizing, we have 6 octonionic descriptions of e6 :



                                                   45
Theorem 6. The compact real form of e6 is given by

                          e6   ∼
                               =   isom((C ⊗ O)P2 )
                               ∼
                               =   der(O) ⊕ der(h3 (C)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3 (C))
                               ∼
                               =   der(h3 (O)) ⊕ sh3 (O)
                               ∼
                               =   der(O) ⊕ sa3 (C ⊗ O)
                               ∼
                               =   so(O ⊕ C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)2
                               ∼
                               =   so(O) ⊕ so(C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)3

where in each case the Lie bracket of e6 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.
   The smallest nontrivial representations of E6 are 27-dimensional: in fact it has two inequivalent
representations of this dimension, which are dual to one another. Now, the exceptional Jordan
algebra is also 27-dimensional, and in 1950 this clue led Chevalley and Schafer [21] to give a nice
description of E6 as symmetries of this algebra. These symmetries do not preserve the product, but
only the determinant.
   More precisely, the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of h3 (O) turns out to
be a noncompact real form of E6 . This real form is sometimes called E6(−26) , because its Killing form
has signature −26. To see this, note that any automorphism of h3 (O) preserves the determinant, so
we get an inclusion
                                           F4 ֒→ E6(−26) .
This means that F4 is a compact subgroup of E6(−26) . In fact it is a maximal compact subgroup, since
if there were a larger one, we could average a Riemannian metric group on OP2 with respect to this
group and get a metric with an isometry group larger than F4 , but no such metric exists. It follows
that the Killing form on the Lie algebra e6(−26) is negative definite on its 52-dimensional maximal
compact Lie algebra, f4 , and positive definite on the complementary 26-dimensional subspace, giving
a signature of 26 − 52 = −26.
    We saw in Section 3.4 that the projective plane structure of OP2 can be constructed starting
only with the determinant function on the vector space h3 (O). It follows that E6(−26) acts as
collineations on OP2 , that is, line-preserving transformations. In fact, the group of collineations
of OP2 is precisely E6(−26) :
                                         E6(−26) ∼= Coll(OP2 ).
Moreover, just as the group of isometries of OP2 fixing a specific point is a copy of Spin(9), the
group of collineations fixing a specific point is Spin(9, 1). This fact follows with some work starting
from equation (8), and it gives us a commutative square of inclusions:

                                Spin(9) −→ Isom(OP2 ) ∼ = F4
                                   ↓            ↓
                               Spin(9, 1) −→ Coll(OP2 ) ∼
                                                        = E6(−26)

where the groups on the top are maximal compact subgroups of those on the bottom. Thus in a
very real sense, F4 is to 9-dimensional Euclidean geometry as E6(−26) is to 10-dimensional Lorentzian
geometry.

4.5    E7
Next we turn to the 133-dimensional exceptional Lie group E7 . In 1954, Freudenthal [41] de-
scribed this group as the automorphism group of a 56-dimensional octonionic structure now called




                                                  46
a ‘Freudenthal triple system’. We sketch this idea below, but first we give some magic square
constructions. Vinberg’s version of the magic square gives

                                   e7 = der(H) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3 (H ⊗ O).

Tits’ version gives
                               e7 ∼
                                  = der(H) ⊕ der(h3 (O)) ⊕ (Im(H)⊗sh3 (O))                        (22)
and also
                               e7 ∼
                                  = der(O) ⊕ der(h3 (H)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3 (H))
The Barton-Sudbery version gives

                                     e7 ∼
                                        = tri(O) ⊕ tri(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)3                              (23)

   Starting from equation (22) and using the fact that der(H) ∼= Im(H) is 3-dimensional, we obtain
the elegant formula
                                   e7 ∼
                                      = der(h3 (O)) ⊕ h3 (O)3 .
This gives an illuminating way to compute the dimension of e7 :

                      dim(e7 ) = dim(der(h3 (O))) + 3 dim(h3 (O)) = 52 + 3 · 27 = 133.

Starting from equation (23) and using the concrete descriptions of tri(H) and tri(O) from equation
(21), we obtain
                             e7 ∼
                                = so(O) ⊕ so(H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)3
Using equation (17), we may rewrite this as

                                   e7 ∼
                                      = so(O ⊕ H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)2 .

Though not obvious from what we have done, the direct summand so(O ⊕ H) ⊕ Im(H) here is really
a Lie subalgebra of e7 . In less octonionic language, this result can also be found in Adams’ book [2]:

                                         e7 ∼                   +
                                            = so(12) ⊕ sp(1) ⊕ S12

He describes the bracket in e7 in terms of natural operations involving so(12) and its spinor rep-
               +
resentation S12  . The funny-looking factor of sp(1) comes from the fact that this representation is
                                                                       +                     +
quaternionic. The bracket of an element of sp(1) and an element of S12    is the element of S12 defined
using the natural action of sp(1) on this space.
    If we let E7 be the simply connected group with Lie algebra e7 , it follows from results of Adams
[2] that the subgroup generated by the Lie subalgebra so(12) ⊕ sp(1) is isomorphic to (Spin(12) ×
Sp(1))/Z2 . This lets us define the quateroctonionic projective plane by

                                (H ⊗ O)P2 = E7 / ((Spin(12) × Sp(1))/Z2 )
                                                                                    + ∼
and conclude that the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S12 = (H ⊗ O)2 .
We can put an E7 -invariant Riemannian metric on this manifold by the technique of averaging over
the group action. It then turns out [6] that

                                          E7 ∼
                                             = Isom((H ⊗ O)P2 )

and thus
                                          e7 ∼
                                             = isom((H ⊗ O)P2 ).
   Summarizing, we have the following 7 octonionic descriptions of e7 :

where in each case the Lie bracket of e7 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.

    Before the magic square was developed, Freudenthal [41] used another octonionic construction
to study E7 . The smallest nontrivial representation of this group is 56-dimensional. Freudenthal
realized we can define a 56-dimensional space
                                          
                                     α x
                             F ={             : x, y ∈ h3 (O), α, β ∈ R}
                                     y β

and equip this space with a symplectic structure

                                           ω: F × F → R

and trilinear product
                                         τ: F × F × F → F
such that the group of linear transformations preserving both these structures is a certain noncom-
pact real form of E7 , namely E7(−25) . The symplectic structure and trilinear product on F satisfy
some relations, and algebraists have made these into the definition of a ‘Freudenthal triple system’
[13, 36, 72]. The geometrical significance of this rather complicated sort of structure has recently
been clarified by some physicists working on string theory. At the end of the previous section, we
mentioned a relation between 9-dimensional Euclidean geometry and F4 , and a corresponding rela-
tion between 10-dimensional Lorentzian geometry and E6(−26) . Murat Günaydin [48] has extended
this to a relation between 10-dimensional conformal geometry and E7(−25) , and in work with Kil-
ian Koepsell and Hermann Nikolai [49] has explicated how this is connected to Freudenthal triple
systems.

4.6    E8
With 248 dimensions, E8 is the biggest of the exceptional Lie groups, and in some ways the most
mysterious. The easiest way to understand a group is to realize it as as symmetries of a structure
one already understands. Of all the simple Lie groups, E8 is the only one whose smallest nontrivial
representation is the adjoint representation. This means that in the context of linear algebra, E8 is
most simply described as the group of symmetries of its own Lie algebra! One way out of this vicious
circle would be to describe E8 as isometries of a Riemannian manifold. As already mentioned, E8
is the isometry group of a 128-dimensional manifold called (O ⊗ O)P2 . But alas, nobody seems to
know how to define (O ⊗ O)P2 without first defining E8 . Thus this group remains a bit enigmatic.
    At present, to get our hands on E8 we must start with its Lie algebra. We can define this
using any of the three equivalent magic square constructions explained in Section 4.3. Vinberg’s
construction gives
                                 e8 = der(O) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3 (O ⊗ O).



                                                  48
Tits’ construction gives

                            e8 ∼
                               = der(O) ⊕ der(h3 (O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3 (O)).

The Barton-Sudbery construction gives

                                  e8     ∼
                                         =    tri(O) ⊕ tri(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)3
                                         ∼                                                              (24)
                                         =    so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)3

We can use any of these to count the dimension of e8 ; for example, the last one gives

                                    dim e8 = 28 + 28 + 3 · 82 = 248.

   To emphasize the importance of triality, we can rewrite equation (24) as:

                      e8 ∼
                         = so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8 ) ⊕ (S8+ ⊗ S8+ ) ⊕ (S8− ⊗ S8− ).                    (25)

Here the Lie bracket is built from natural maps relating so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible
representations. In particular, so(8) ⊕ so(8) is a Lie subalgebra, and the first copy of so(8) acts on
the first factor in V8 ⊗ V8 , S8+ ⊗ S8+ , and S8− ⊗ S8− , while the second copy acts on the second factor
in each of these. The reader should compare this to the description of f4 in equation (18).
    Now, equation (17) implies that

                                  so(16) ∼
                                         = so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8 ).

Together with equation (25), this suggests that e8 contains so(16) as a Lie subalgebra. In fact this
is true! Even better, if we restrict the right-handed spinor representation of so(16) to so(8) ⊕ so(8),
it decomposes as
                                      + ∼
                                    S16  = (S8+ ⊗ S8+ ) ⊕ (S8− ⊗ S8− ),
so we obtain
                                               e8 ∼           +
                                                  = so(16) ⊕ S16                                        (26)
or in more octonionic language,

                                        e8 ∼
                                           = so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)2

where we use so(V ) to mean the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the real
inner product space V .
   The really remarkable thing about equation (26) is that the Lie bracket in e8 is entirely built
                                         +
from natural maps involving so(16) and S16 :
                                                           +     +                 +     +
            so(16) ⊗ so(16) → so(16),            so(16) ⊗ S16 → S16 ,             S16 ⊗ S16 → so(16).

The first of these is the Lie bracket in so(16), the second is the action of so(16) on its right-handed
spinor representation, and the third is obtained from the second by duality, using the natural inner
                           +
product on so(16) and S16     to identify these spaces with their duals. In fact, this is a very efficient
way to define e8 . If we take this approach, we must verify the Jacobi identity:

                                       [[a, b], c] = [a, [b, c]] − [b, [a, c]].

When all three of a, b, c lie in so(16) this is just the Jacobi identity for so(16). When two of them
lie in so(16), it boils down to fact that spinors indeed form a representation of so(16). Thanks to
duality, the same is true when just one lies in so(16). It thus suffices to consider the case when a, b, c
            +
all lie in S16 . This is the only case that uses anything special about the number 16. Unfortunately,
at this point a brute-force calculation seems to be required. For two approaches that minimize the


                                                         49
pain, see the books by Adams [2] and by Green, Schwarz and Witten [46]. It would be nice to find
a more conceptual approach.
   Starting from e8 , we can define E8 to be the simply-connected Lie group with this Lie algebra. As
shown by Adams [2], the subgroup of E8 generated by the Lie subalgebra so(16) ⊂ e8 is Spin(16)/Z2 .
This lets us define the octooctonionic projective plane by

                                    (O ⊗ O)P2 = E8 / (Spin(16)/Z2 ).
                                                                                         + ∼
By equation (26), the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S16      = (O ⊗ O)2 .
This partially justifies calling it ‘octooctonionic projective plane’, though it seems not to satisfy the
usual axioms for a projective plane.
   We can put an E8 -invariant Riemannian metric on the octooctonionic projective plane by the
technique of averaging over the group action. It then turns out [6] that

                                        E8 ∼
                                           = Isom((O ⊗ O)P2 )

and thus
                                         e8 ∼
                                            = isom((O ⊗ O)P2 ).
    Summarizing, we have the following octonionic descriptions of E8 :
Theorem 8. The compact real form of e8 is given by

                           e8   ∼
                                =   isom((O ⊗ O)P2 )
                                ∼
                                =   der(O) ⊕ der(h3 (O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3 (O))
                                ∼
                                =   der(O) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3 (O ⊗ O)
                                ∼
                                =   so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)2
                                ∼
                                =   so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)3

where in each case the Lie bracket on e8 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.


5     Conclusions
It should be clear by now that besides being a fascinating mathematical object in their own right,
the octonions link together many important phenomena whose connections would otherwise be
completely mysterious. Indeed, the full story of these connections is deeper and more elaborate than
I have been able to explain here! It also includes:
    • Attempts to set up an octonionic analogue of the theory of analytic functions (see [51] and the
      references therein).
    • The role of Jordan pairs, Jordan triple systems and Freudenthal triple systems in the construc-
      tion of exceptional Lie groups [13, 36, 37, 49, 51, 71, 72].
    • Constructions of the E8 lattice and Leech lattice using integral octonions [26, 33].
    • Tensor-categorical approaches to normed division algebras and the invariant of framed trivalent
      graphs coming from the quantum group associated to G2 [9, 12, 64, 81].
    • Octonionic constructions of vertex operator algebras [38].
    • Octonionic constructions of the exceptional simple Lie superalgebras [92].
    • Octonionic constructions of symmetric spaces [6].


                                                   50
   • Octonions and the geometry of the ‘squashed 7-spheres’, that is, the homogeneous spaces
     Spin(7)/G2 , Spin(6)/SU(3), and Spin(5)/SU(2), all of which are diffeomorphic to S 7 with its
     usual smooth structure [22].
   • The theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’, that is, 7-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with holonomy
     group G2 [60].
   • The octonionic Hopf map and instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in 8 dimensions
     [47].
   • Octonionic aspects of 10-dimensional superstring theory and 10-dimensional super-Yang-Mills
     theory [25, 29, 35, 65, 85, 86].
   • Octonionic aspects of 11-dimensional supergravity and supermembrane theories, and the role
     of Joyce manifolds in compactifying 11-dimensional supergravity to obtain theories of physics
     in 4 dimensions [32].
   • Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C ⊗ H ⊗ O [31].
   • Other attempts to use the octonions in physics [20, 51, 67, 76].
I urge the reader to explore these with the help of the references.
