II meeting on Constrained Dynamics and Quantum Gravity, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sept.96.
For Tullio Regge on his 65th birthday
This is an informal review of the formulation of canonical general relativity and of its implications for quantum
gravity; the various versions are compared, both in the continuum and in a discretized approximation suggested
by Regge calculus. I also show that the weakness of the link with the geometric content of the theory gives rise
to what I think is a serious flaw in the claimed derivation of a discrete structure for space at the quantum level.

1. Introduction
From chromodynamics, I have inherited the
prejudice that a decent quantum field theory
must have a credible discrete approximation. Being deep rooted, this prejudice resists counterexamples. In particular, Regge calculus [1] makes
the geometric content of General Relativity so
clear that I find difficult to believe that a successful quantization scheme would not originate,
or translate cleanly into this discretized approximation. And therefore, I am reluctant to add the
quantization of Regge calculus to the list of counterexamples, in spite of the modest success which
the various attempts have achieved [2–5], and of
the unquestionable fact that what progress there
has been has been achieved ignoring this point of
view.
I shall give a quick sketch of the recent work
on canonical quantization of gravity, and a tentative critique of this work in the light of what
I claim Regge calculus would suggest, with side
comments on the meaning of the results so far
obtained. So, in spite of the rather generic title,
I shall mention only a small fraction of the work
going on.
The idea that gravity should be treated as a
connection theory underlies all the work I shall
be considering, and this is where I shall begin;
the other main ingredient is the idea of the ”loop
representation” of Rovelli and Smolin, which has
evolved into a theory of ”Spin nets”, and this will

be discussed next, with a brief summary of the
striking and very recent progress that has taken
place. Here I shall try and explain why I think
that these results are spoilt by the imperfect link
of the theory with the geometric content of general relativity. The crucial importance of this link
will be illustrated using Regge calculus as an example.
2. Connections and constraints.
If the aim is to formulate canonical general relativity as a some sort of gauge theory on 3–space,
we have various options[6].
Option (1) is A.D.M. geometrodynamics
rewritten as a connection theory.
One follows A.D.M. taking space slices Σt :
t(x) =const., with a congruence ta : ta ∂a t = 1
related to the unit normal to the slice na by
ta = N na + N a , or na = −N ∂a t; however

S = 2κ

ǫIJKL eI ∧ eJ ∧ RKL (where
an action S = 4κ
KL
R
is the curvature 2–form of the Levi–Civita
connection ΩIJ , and κ := (8πGN ewton )/c3 ), and
the further choice is made to partially fix the
O(3, 1) gauge freedom setting:
e0a = −na = N ∂a t

(1)

This choice (”time gauge”) leaves invariance under local O(3) transformations, with eia , i =
1, 2, 3 space–like to provide a local frame on the

2
slice. The pull–back of ΩIJ to the space slice gives
the 3–d L.C. connection Γia := 12 qab ǫjik Ωjk
b , and
ib
the extrinsic curvature Kai := qab Ω0i
b = e Kab .
As canonical variables we take the pair:
(E ia := 21 ǫabc ǫijk ejb ekc = det(eia ) eia , Kai )

(2)

They form a canonical pair, just like the
√
(qab , π ab := q(K ab − q ab K) variables of A.D.M.,
ia ib
because E E = q q ab implies:
1

Kai δE ia = √ Kab δ(E ia E ib ) = − π ab δqab (3)

The Γia have curvature Rab
, and can be exia
pressed in terms of E (and its inverse) solving
the 9 linear equations they satisfy:

Da E ia = 0 ;

(b

c)

ǫijk Eia Ej Da Ek = 0

(4)

We need to impose the A.D.M. constraint, and
to constrain Kai to make sure that Kab =
i
√1 qbc E c Ka
is symmetrical; altogether:
i

Gi := ǫijk Kaj E ka ≈ 0

Everything can be rewitten in terms of 2×2 matrices saturating i, j, . . . indices with τi := σi /(2i);
so for ex. the effect of local rotations becomes:
E a := τi E ia
Γa := τi Γia

→ U E a U −1
→ U (Γa + ∂a )U −1

(5)

There is nothing particularly new about any of
this; in particular Kai fits into the scheme poorly,
like an external field, and the connection is a derived quantity.
Option (2) is a shrewd variation on the theme
devised by J. F. Barbero[7,6], in a re–examination
of the Ashtekar[8] formulation.
For some β to be fixed, we can change our basic
variables as follows:
(E

ia

, Kai )

→ (E

ia

,

Aa(β)i := Γia + β Kai )

(6)

which is a canonical transformation, because
1
E ia δAa(β)i = βE ia δKai + ∂a (ǫ̃abc ekb δekc )
2

(7)

so that:
{Aa(β)i (x), E jb (y)} = βκ δji δab δ(x, y)

(8)

and all other Poisson brackets vanish (in partic(β)i
(β)j
ular, {Aa , Ab } = 0). However unlike Kai ,
(β)i
Aa transforms like an SU (2) connection for any
(β)
β, and one can introduce Da derivatives and
(β)i
a curvature Fab . Using the properties of the
Levi–Civita connection and a bit of algebra the
constraints become:

(β)i

E ia Fab

Da(β) E ia = βGi ≈ 0

= β Vb + β 2 Kbj Gj ≈ 0

H= p
ǫijk E ia E jb Fab
det(E)

(1 + β 2 ) [a b] i j
−2 p
Ei Ej Ka Kb + . . . ≈ 0
det(E)

where the dots are terms proportional to βGi and
its derivatives.
Clearly the first two constraints are in an acceptable form, and the last one is not: the bit proportional
to (1 + β 2 ) is a mess, the overall factor
p
1/ det(E) is unpleasant. As for this last point:
we either learn to live with the factor, or we ignore it, absorbing it in the Lagrange multiplier.
The messy bit is more troublesome. The quickest way to get rid of it would be to take β = i.
This is Ashtekar’s original choice (together
with
p
the idea of absorbing the factor 1/ det(E) in
the Lagrange multiplier)[8] . The point is that
there is much more to be said for this choice: it
is (or, one can convince oneself that it is) the
one choice that is geometrically and physically
(i)i
well motivated. In fact the connection Aa is
the pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual
connection, and E ia the pull–back of the self–dual
product of two vierbeins:
A(i)i
a

jk
0i
i
b
1
:= qab CIJ
ΩIJ
b := qa (− 2 ǫijk Ωb + iΩb )

E ia

i
:= −ǫabc CIJ
eIb eJc

(9)

This definition of E ia coincides with eq. (2) if
we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1); for the defi(i)i
nition of Aa to coincide with eq. (6) we have
to assume ”time gauge” and to impose explicitly

3
that the connection ΩIJ
a is Levi–Civita, which follows if we add to the constraints the real part of
the second eq. (4) as a brand new ”reality” condition. The result is, I think, physically splendid,
because we retain the full Lorentz group as gauge
group of the canonical theory, but technically appalling, because of the obvious complications implicit in the use of complex variables. In particular, the i which now occurs in the Poisson brackets eq. (8) puts all simple minded quantizations
on collision course with the desire to have the
operators corrsponding to E ia hermitean. More
particularly, I have not found a way round this
difficulty, simple minded or not.
The alternative that has become most popular is to take β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”.
I would like to claim that the trouble with this
choice is that the connection has no obvious geometric meaning, and that there is nothing special
about the value 1. In fact, β can be anything,
and I shall leave it arbitrary (but real > 0) in the
following. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the second term of H is proportional to (1− β 2 ), and the
choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”natural” for the (-+++) signature, but that’s not
saying much, unless somehow we learn to ”Wick–
rotate” the theory. For this possibility [6] see
later.
There are at least two smart ways out of the
inconvenience that Kai is a complicated function
(β)i
and E ia (so that the expression of H
of Aa
is messy), which come by roundabout arguments
devised by T. Thiemann[9]. I begin by listing
some identities; let f (x), h(x) be nice test functions on Σ, and
Z
f
(β)k
√
ǫijk E ia E jb Fab d3 x
HE [f ] :=
det E
Σ
Z √
(10)
h det Ed3 x
V [h] :=
Σ

then one can work out the following remarkable
Poisson brackets:
Z
 E
f h E ia Kai d3 x =
H [f ] , V [h]
= 2β 2 κ
Σ


T [f ] , E ia (x)

{T [f ] , Kai (x)}

:=

2β 2 κ2 T [f h]

=

+f (x)E ia (x)

=

−f (x)Kai (x)

Aa(β)i , V [h]

cd
1 ib
2 E ǫabc q ∂d f

√
ǫabc ǫijk E ia E jb
4 det E

I shall ignore possible problems with boundary
terms, write simply V := V [1], T := T [1], H E :=
HE [1], and summarize the above as:
{H E , V } = 2β 2 κ2 T
{T, Γia } = 0

; {T, E ia } = E ia
; {T, Kai } = −Kai

(12)

One use of these identities could be to rewrite H
in the (possibly more manageable) form:
βκ
(β)i
H = {Aa(β)i , V }ǫabc Fbc
2
−

(13)

1 + β 2 (β)i
(β)j
{Aa , V }ǫabc ǫijk {Ab , T }{Ac(β)k , T }
β2

This is the line followed by T. Thiemann in [9],
and claimed to be a runaway success.
A more fancy approach starts from the observation that the Hamiltonian evolution induced by
some H on a function f on phase space is given
by the map:
WH (t) ◦ f := f + t{f, H} +

t2
{{f, H}, H} + ..(14)
2!

which preserves Poisson brackets etc.; furthermore, from eq.(12):
WT (t) ◦ E ia
WT (t) ◦ Aa(β)i

= e−t E ia
= Γia + βet Kai

(15)

One may say that this relation shows explicitly
that the value of β does not matter, since it can
be changed at will (which is the point I am trying to make). More boldly, that it gives us a way
to go from the Barbero to the Ashtekar connection, setting t = iπ/2 if we had β = 1 [10,6] .
This idea of a ”Wick rotation” is striking, but I
find it very difficult to articulate. In particular,
I find difficult to understand how the transformation brings about a change of (gauge) symmetry group. I nevertheless regard this as the most
promising clue to the construction of a satisfactory quantum theory within this set of ideas.

3. Spin nets.
To quantize the theory we may use the connection representation, in which states are function(β)i
als of Aa (x), and
E ia

→

Ê ia :=

βκh̄ δ
i δAa(β)i

(16)

The important states turn out to be ”spin net
states”, which are an obvious generalization of
Wilson loops.

Take for ex. the net in the picture, which
has 5 vertices and 10 lines, and lives in a space
(β)i
with a connection Aa ; assign to each line
γl an orientation, hence a ”transporter” gl :=
R
(β)i
P exp l τi Aa dγla , and a spin sl = 0, 12 , 1, . . .,
sl
so that γl → Dmm
′ (gl ); assign to each vertex v
v
, and we shall
an SU (2) invariant tensor Cm
a ,..,md
have that:
XY
Y
v
ψn (g1 , ..., g10 ) =
C...
D..sl (gl )
(17)
{m} v

l

is gauge invariant. If gl ∈ SU (2), and we indicate by dgl the Haar measure, these states form a
(smallish) Hilbert space with the scalar product:
Z
(18)
< ψn′ |ψn >= ψ n′ ψn dg1 . . . dg10
Ashtekar and collaborators have discovered and
emphasized again and again (see e.g.[11] ) that
if one considers all possible nets, then the (very
large) set of these states is dense in the Hilbert
space of gauge invariant functionals of A(β) . In

this sense eq.(18) induces a measure DA(β) in this
space.
The gauge invariant functionals of A(β) which
might represent physical states are invariant
under diffeomorphism. Given one such state
Ψ[A(β) ], for every spin net state ψn [A(β) ] we can
in principle calculate its ”loop transform”:
Z
Ψ(n) := DA(β) ψ n [A(β) ] Ψ[A(β) ]
(19)
that will represent the same state, and is diffeomorphic invariant if it depends only on the structure of the net and on our assigments of spins
and invariant tensors. This is the latest incarnation of the ”loop representation” idea of Rovelli
and Smolin[12]. This form goes particularly well
with the idea of the ”weave”[13]: that the world
that (we think) we know is likely to be described
by states Ψ(n) with support on huge, immensely
complicated and fine meshed nets, in fact with
mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length.
If we keep in mind the weave idea, it is quite
sensible to look at net states to find the spectrum
of the operators that correspond to the area of a
surface S and to the volume of a region R, and
to study the operator form of the constraints.
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset
L of lines of the net, does not touch the vertices,
has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the
operator (first taking the square root, then removing the regulator), one finds[11,14] :
Z
q
Â(S)ψn = : d2 σ na nb Ê ia Ê ib : ψn
s
Xp
= (βh̄κ)
sl (sl + 1) ψn
(20)
l∈L

If the region R contains a subset V of vertices
of the net, one finds[14–16] by a similar procedure that a suitably regularized volume operator
V̂ (R) mixes the states ψn with coefficients pro3
portional to (βh̄κ) 2 . This operator can be diagonalized[14] , and has a complicated, but discrete
spectrum. Before going further, it is important
to notice that nothing works for the theory based
on the Ashtekar connection β = i: all operators
have the wrong hermiticity; on this, see later.
However, I claim that the discrete spectra one
gets for areas and volume cannot at this stage be

5
interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of
space, because of the arbitrariness of β; we are
faced with a ”β crisis”. Unless we find some good
reason to fix β, the commutation relations eq.(8)
will be unable to fix the scale of the theory. My
feeling is that this requires a group larger than
SU (2); a bit like in good old current algebra. A
larger group may come from the need to implement the ”Wick rotation”, whether interpreted as
a passage from the Euclidean to the Minkowskian
or from the Barbero to the Ashtekar connection
I do not know.
Alternatively, it may be that looking at the
Wheeler De Witt equation Ĥ · Ψ = 0, following
Thiemann’s work [9] , we shall find that solutions exist only for particular values of β. Given
the way in which eq.(13) depends on β, this is
actually rather likely; but then, it m ay be just another way of saying the same thing. At the same
time, if it were true it would be splendid: because
we would have derived the discreteness of space
from dynamics, and not from a kinematic fiddle.

(12)

Thiemann’s work [9] on the Hamiltonian constraint is the latest thing. It is a massive and difficult piece of work, so that my comments, based on
a very limited understanding, are obviously very
tentative. The main effort is aimed at defining a
satisfactory quantum operator corresponding to
HE [f ], eq.(10), from which, in view of eq.(11,12)
the rest follows (more or less). A regularization is
obtained noticing that for a vertex v of a net and

The pattern I have described so far occurs again
if you try and discretize the theory, except that
there are more variants: from the variable mesh
discretizations of the groups that solve problems
in the classical theory numerically (an industry in
rapid expansion), to emulatations of lattice gauge
theory or to the theory of random triangulations.
I shall restrict myself drastically, and try to keep
close in spirit to the original Regge idea.
Divide space in tetrahedra with a flat inside:
the natural variables corresponding to the E ia
would be the areas of the triangles, oriented outwards with respect to a frame local to the tetrahedron:
S := τi S i := τi E ia ǫabc 12 (x1 x2 +x2 x3 +x3 x1 )bc (23)
The area square of a triangle will be S i S i , and
of course tetrahedra must close; for the tetrahedron A = (1234), labeling each triangle with the

6
number of the vertex opposite, this gives the constraint:
S1i + S2i + S3i + S4i = 0

(24)

The volume square of the tetrahedron will be :
VA2 =

ǫijk i j k
(S S S + S1i S4j S3k + S2i S4j S1k + S3i S2j S1k )
18 2 3 4
The variables S must be paired with variables g
that link the frame attached to tetrahedron A to
the one of its neighbour B across the triangle,
with the basic condition that the triangle looks
the same from both sides:

SB = −gAB

An explicit parametrization for the triangle (123)
would be :
SA := uA · τ3 s · u−1
A
with : uA = eατ3 eβτ2
gAB := uA eΦτ3 2τ2 u−1

;

SB := uB · τ3 s · u−1

uB := eγτ3 eδτ2
(27)

(28)

I omit the details: the point is that from these
relations we can calculate all the angles Φ, and
for the curvature around the edge (12) we find:

= u4A e

φA τ 3

RA := eFA =
(θA +θB +θC −2π)τ2

(29)
2τ2 e−φA τ3 u−1

Curvature is essentially the ”defect angle” in the
rotation; the connection is Levi–Civita.
But what can we make of the Kai ? To make the
connection ”dynamic”, we must give up eq.(28),
and therefore (29), and leave the angles Φ arbitrary, because that is the only place where the extrinsic curvature can go. Omitting details again,
by various plausibility arguments, and insisting
that in the limit eq.(8) is recovered,
one finds for
R
the Liouville form Θ (the pdq bit of the action)
and for the Poisson brackets:


Tr St δgt gt−1 T
Θ = −
βκ
{S i , S j }

If g is a rotation, we will discover the local geometry of our space going round an edge, from
tetrahedron to tetrahedron, until we get back:
then if we are not in the same frame we started
from, we conclude that space is curved. Changes
of the frames, i.e. local rotations, are ”gauge”
transformations, which translate eq.(5) to:
;

−1
[S3A , S4A ] gAB ] = 0
[[S3B , S5B ] , gAB

T

−1
SA → g A SA g A

with s > 0; the angle Φ is arbitrary at this stage.
Suppose that we are given the lengths of all
edges, like in Regge’s original scheme for ”general
relativity without coordinates”: then we are in
a Riemannian space, and we have conditions for
the triangles that share an edge; for the edge (12)
they read:

{g (1) , g (2) }

t∈T

= βκ ǫijk S k ; {g, S i } = βκ τi g
= 0

(30)

In the explicit parametrization eq.(27) each triangle contributes to the Liouville form:
−

Tr(S δg g −1 ) =

=
(s δΦ + s cos β δα + s cos δ δγ)
βκ

(31)

I have not tried to write the constraints for real
β. The idea of squeezing in dynamics by fiddling
Φ may appear ugly and artificial, but it is the
sense of the ”Barbero connection”. The Ashtekar
choice makes much more sense: one replaces the
Φ we calculated above with a complex variable:
Φ

→

Φ + iζ

(32)

7
so that gAB is promoted to a Lorentz transformation, with rapidity ζ, that links the different inertial frames attached to tetrahedra A and B. One
may say that this is physically well motivated,
and follows straight from the principle of equivalence. However, extending the gauge transformations eq.(26) from SU (2) to SL(2, C) inevitably
creates complications: we have to impose explicitly that within a tetrahedron SIi SJi is real and
positive definite, and eq.(28) has to be modified.
On the other hand we know that the Hamiltonian
constraint simplifies to the HE form, for which it
is not difficult to guess discrete versions, for ex.:
X

I<J∈T

1
Tr([SI , SJ ]FIJ )T ≈ 0
VT

(33)

in words: for each tetrahedron, the sum of the
lengths of the edges times the corresponding defect angle must vanish. This comes about because
for the edge (12) of A we can see that
i
:=
l(12)

2
ǫijk S4j S3k ≈ eia (xa2 − x1a )
3VA

(34)

In practice to make any use of eq.(33), which
is certainly not the only expression possible, we
must approximate F with some function of R,
e.g.F ≈ (R − R−1 )/2. The same or a similar
expression can be used for the HE part of the
Hamiltonian constraint for real β. It is unfortunate that, as far as I can see, the regularized form
used by Thiemann is just about the least natural
in this scheme. This is because, at the first step
one finds, for ex.:
g4 {g4−1 , VA } =

βκτi ǫijk j k
(S2 S3 + S3j S1k + S1j S2k )
36V

a rather uncooperative expression; or, said more
generally, because Thiemann’s tetrahedra live in
a lattice dual to the Regge lattice1 , in which to
each of our triangles corresponds a line, and to
each tetrahedron a (4–valent) vertex.
1 notice that in eq.(21) the volume operator V̂

acts on the
vertices of the net, that correspond to Regge tetrahedra,
while V(123) is the volume of a tetrahedron in the dual
lattice.

Now for quantization. At first sight, from what
I said about nets, it would appear that discretization, and Regge calculus in particular, offers the
perfect tool; in fact, I became interested in Regge
calculus because I was trying with spin nets. Spin
nets naturally live in the dual of the Regge lattice. One can immediately envisage putting on a
(small) computer a finite, simple lattice like a five
tetrahedra division of S 3 . In a real SU (2) formulation the quantization of areas follows directly
from eq.(31): the area variable s is conjugate to
an angle Φ. This is just the way ’t Hooft argued in his discretized 2+1 gravity[17] , but with
a very refined argument to Wick-rotate the theory. However, the direct use of the Ashtekar connection for quantization is made impossible by a
muddle over the measure. I shall explain this in
detail because I still hope that the muddle has a
simple solution that I cannot see because of some
selective blindness.
One can see what the problem is quite simply
by writing the quantum version of eq.(30) for β =
i:
[Ŝ i , Ŝ j ] = −κ ǫijk Ŝ k ;
[ĝ (1) , ĝ (2) ] = 0

[ĝ, Ŝ i ] = −κ τi ĝ

(35)
(36)

so that if ψ = ψ({g}), Ŝ i = −κT̂Li , the (holomorphic) generator of the left–regular representation
of SL(2, C). The problem is that now there is no
way to juggle the measure to make Ŝ i hermitean;
worse, Ŝ 2 is negative, with eigenvalues −j(j + 1).
Of course one did expect troubles: there are always troubles with non–compact groups, e.g. in
2+1 gravity[18], and even linearized gravity turns
out to be quite tricky[19]; in QED the scalar product is well defined only for gauge invariant states.
So the cure should come from considering the
Hamiltonian constraint; in an interesting analysis of the linearized case[20] the suggestion is that
one should gauge fix it. In our case, the idea of
”Wick rotation” seems much more attractive, but
notice that in any case it depends on solving the
Hamiltonian constraint.
The idea[10] is that one can apply to this transformation the formalism of ”coherent state transformations” developed by B.C. Hall[21] , suitably
generalized. These are isometries between Hilbert

spaces on e.g. SU (2) and on its complexification
SL(2, C); in the simplest case one defines heat
kernels on the two groups by:
∂ρt
+ 12 Ĵ2 ρt = 0
∂t

,

ρ0 = δ(x)

∂µt
+ 41 (Ĵ2 + K̂2 )µt = 0
∂t

,

µ0 = δ(g)

(37)

(notice that (Ĵ2 + K̂2 ) is an elliptic operator, but
not the Casimir). Then the transformation Bt :
Z
f (x)ρt (x−1 g)dx
(38)
f → (Bt f )(g) :=
SU(2)

maps functions on SU (2) which are L2 with the
measure ρt dx to functions on SL(2, C) which are
holomorphic and L2 with the measure µt dg. The
map can be proved to be invertible and isometric,
i.e.
Z
(Bt f )(g) (Bt h)(g) µt (g)dg =
SL(2,C)
Z
=
f (x) h(x)ρt (x)dx
SU(2)

This seems to be just what we need, but the connection with the ”Wick rotation” is still to be
understood.
