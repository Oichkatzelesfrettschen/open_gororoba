                                                        suggested Mlow ≈ 50 M and Mhigh ≈ 130 M . These calculations have been challenged by recent
                                                        LIGO observations that show many black holes merging with individual masses, Mlow >       ∼ 65 M . Here

                                                        we explore four factors affecting the theoretical estimates for the boundaries of this mass gap: nuclear

                                                        with great uncertainty, increase Mlow still further. Dimensionless Kerr parameters close to unity are
