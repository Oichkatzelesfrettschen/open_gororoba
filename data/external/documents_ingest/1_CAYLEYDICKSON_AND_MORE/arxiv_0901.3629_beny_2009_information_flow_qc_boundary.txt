    The theory of decoherence aims to explain how macroscopic quantum objects
become effectively classical. Understanding this process could help in the search
for the quantum theory underlying gravity, and suggest new schemes for preserving
the coherence of technological quantum devices.
    The process of decoherence is best understood in terms of information flow
within a quantum system, and between the system and its environment. We develop
a novel way of characterizing this information, and give a sufficient condition for
its classicality. These results generalize previous models of decoherence, clarify the
process by which a phase-space based on non-commutative quantum variables can
emerge, and provide a possible explanation for the universality of the phenomenon
of decoherence. In addition, the tools developed in this approach generalize the
theory of quantum error correction to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
    We characterize the nature of the information preserved by a quantum chan-
nel by the observables which exist in its image (in the Heisenberg picture). The
sharp observables preserved by a channel form an operator algebra which can be
characterized in terms of the channel’s elements. The effect of the channel on these
observables can be reversed by another physical transformation. These results gen-
eralize the theory of quantum error correction to codes characterized by arbitrary
von Neumann algebras, which can represent hybrid quantum-classical information,
continuous variable systems, or certain quantum field theories.
    The preserved unsharp observables (positive operator-valued measures) allow for
a finer characterization of the information preserved by a channel. We show that the
only type of information which can be duplicated arbitrarily many times consists
of coarse-grainings of a single POVM. Based on these results, we propose a model
of decoherence which can account for the emergence of a realistic classical phase-
space. This model supports the view that the quantum-classical correspondence
is given by a quantum-to-classical channel, which is another way of representing a
POVM.

Introduction

At present, the best of our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature is
summarized by the standard model of particle physics, together with the general
theory of relativity. This understanding is not perfect and fails to account for
certain cosmological and astronomical observations. In addition, there are purely
logical reasons to want to modify general relativity or the standard model. For
instance, we do not have a reasonable idea of how the gravitational field, which
is modeled classically, should interact with quantum fields. Since all of matter is
modeled at the fundamental level by quantum fields, this represents a large hole in
our understanding of nature. Experiments are of little help because gravitational
effects are extremely weak in the regimes where the quantum nature of fields can
be probed.
    It is usually assumed on logical grounds that the first necessary step toward
a consistent picture of all fundamental interactions would be to replace general
relativity by a quantum theory of gravity. The problem of quantum gravity can be
summarized as the search for a quantum theory which has general relativity as a
classical limit.
    There do exist several empirical methods to find a “quantum version” of a clas-
sical theory—a process called quantization—but these methods do not guarantee
that the quantum theory obtained will have the classical theory we started from
as a classical limit. Instead, quantization methods are most often used as a tool
to describe a quantum theory using some form of classical intuition, even if the
classical model involved does not relate to any macroscopic phenomenon.
   In fact, there is no reason to expect that there exists a well-defined mathematical
procedure which would directly yield a quantum theory starting from its classical
limit. It is the opposite process—namely the derivation of the effective classical
limit of a given quantum theory in a given context—which ought to be completely
understood.
   Given that, surprisingly, very little is known about the subject, we may hy-
pothesize that the problem of deriving the classical limit of a quantum theory has

never been considered of prime importance in the past. Indeed, there is no real
need to be certain that a given quantum theory has the right limit when plenty
of experiments are directly testing the candidate quantum theory itself. This may
explain the usual acceptance of the traditional quantization prescriptions: it does
not matter how the quantum theory was arrived at, as long as experiments say it
is correct.
   However, quantization must be taken more seriously in the context of quantum
gravity, since the classical limit is the only prediction that we can use to refute any
particular model.
    In this thesis we will study the problem of understanding how a quantum system
becomes, or appears, classical. We will do so by generalizing certain results of
quantum information processing. Some of these results were published in References
[1, 2, 3]. Our results on decoherence also appeared in Reference [4].


1.1      Information, channels and classicality
Before we explain in more details the problems that we want to solve, let us clarify
our use of certain terms which can intuitively have various meanings.
    In Section 2.1 we will define precisely what we mean by quantum and classical
physical models. This terminology is uncontroversial because we only use the ad-
jectives quantum and classical to qualify a model and not a physical system itself.
For instance the same system could be described with a quantum as well as a clas-
sical model. Later in the text we will be less pedantic and simply say “classical
system” as a shorthand for “system modeled classically”. If we say that physical
systems are fundamentally quantum, we mean that at the microscopic level they
are best described by a quantum model. Our goal will be to understand how the
classical systems that we are familiar with are related to the underlying quantum
description of the same physics. Of course, one could find a contrived classical
model which is as complete as the quantum description (say Bohm’s theory), how-
ever, even disregarding the multitude of intrinsic problems associated with such a
theory, one would still have to explain how to derive observed classical phenomena
as a limiting case. This is not the path that we are going to follow. We will in
fact obtain reasonable conditions under which an effective classical model emerges
which is related to the underlying quantum model in a non-contextual way (see
Section 5.3).
   A communication channel, or channel for short, will be understood as the most
general way that the state of a system B can be conditioned on that of a system
A. If A and B are both quantum or both classical, this corresponds to the usual
notion of a quantum channel (Section 2.1.4) or classical channel (a stochastic map)
respectively.
   We will use the word “information” essentially as a synonym of “correlation”.
Hence two different systems will always be involved in a sentence containing this

word. For instance we could say that a system B contains information about a
system A. If we possess a joint state for A and B, this would mean that some
observable of A is correlated with some observable of B. More importantly, in the
context where the state of B is a function of the state of A, i.e. if they are related
by a channel, we will say that B contains information about A if, by performing
a measurement on B, we learn something also about A. More precisely, we will
characterize the information that B possesses about A by checking exactly which
property (which observable) we indirectly measure on A when performing a given
measurement on B. This is the concept that we will analyze in Chapter 3.
    This qualitative information can be quantified in certain contexts using gener-
alizations of Shannon’s theory (as for instance in Section 2.1.3). However, we will
be more interested in certain discrete aspects of the structure of this information,
especially whether or not it is classical (Section 5.3).



1.2      The emergence of classicality
It is widely believed that everything in nature is fundamentally quantum. Hence
we need to explain why, and how, most of it actually appears classical in a wide
range of situations. At first glance, the answer may seem obvious: things appear
classical when we do not measure their behaviour accurately enough (compared to
~) to detect their quantumness. The main problem with this answer is that it does
not tell us specifically which observable of the quantum system is being measured
when such an “inaccurate” observation is performed. Indeed, we know that there
are many fundamentally incompatible ways of observing a quantum system. Each
way to do it is labeled by an observable. By contrast, there is a single best way to
observe a classical system: it suffices to measure its precise state. Everything else
can be deduced from it. We will therefore focus on the following question:

Question 1.1. Which quantum observable is being measured in the complete ob-
servation of a classical system?

    This way of formulating the question of the classical limit is not standard, and,
although it is rather natural, it requires some detailed explanations, which are the
subject of Section 5.1.
    The first thing to note, which might be a source of confusion for the reader, is
that there is no need to assume that an observable only takes a single real number
as its value. Although this assumption is rather innocent for a classical system,
where a non-scalar observable can usually be seen a the joint observation of several
scalar observables, it would be a strong conceptual limitation in the context of
quantum mechanics where, as we know, observables cannot in general be measured
jointly. This point is to be made in order to make it clear that measuring the state
of a classical system amounts to observing one very special observable, namely the
4                                                                         Introduction


observable which gives full information about the classical system. Indeed the state-
space of a classical system (i.e. its phase-space) is rarely one-dimensional. Since
any observation of a quantum system is specified by an observable, and since every
classical system is a quantum system in disguise, this phase-space observation must
actually correspond to the observation of a single quantum observable. Hence, our
question: which quantum observable defines this classical system?
    In order to provide a realistic answer to this question we will need to consider the
most general notion of an observable, which is provided by the formalism of Positive-
Operator Valued Measures (POVM). For instance, we know that, in general, the
various variables which parameterize a classical phase-space correspond to non-
commuting quantum observables. This implies that the quantum description of
phase-space must require some approximate joint measurement of non-commuting
observables, something which is readily characterized by a POVM. Hence we will
make extensive use of this notion, although we will specialize it slightly for technical
and conceptual reasons (see Chapter 2).
    Let us remark that there is another important related question, which we will
not address here. A system can behave classically, not with respect to any obser-
vation, but indirectly through the way that it interacts with an auxiliary quantum
system. We are familiar with the description of a quantum system, say an electron,
interacting with a system which is assumed classical, for instance the scalar poten-
tial of the electromagnetic field. We know that the electromagnetic field is in fact
quantum, therefore we must understand why it can be treated classically when we
are concerned with the behaviour of that electron. This example involves no act
of measurement, and is pertinent to the state of our knowledge of the interaction
between quantum fields and gravity, where gravity plays the role of the classical
electromagnetic field.


1.3      Decoherence
Any definition of a quantum measurement refers, explicitly or implicitly, to an in-
teraction between the quantum system and a postulated external classical system
(the observer). Note that the standard framework of quantum mechanics will be
recovered explicitly in this way in Chapter 2. However, a quantum system interact-
ing with other quantum systems can also undergo at least part of the phenomenon
of collapse associated with a traditional axiomatic measurement. This is the ex-
perimentally ubiquitous process of decoherence characterized, in its simpler form,
by an evolution of the form
                                      X
                                 ρ 7→    |iihi|ρ|iihi|.                       (1.1)
                                        i

for some basis |ii, indexed by the integer i.
   Based on this phenomenon, the theory of decoherence [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] pro-
vides an answer to Question 1.1. The premise is that nothing really important
Decoherence                                                                           5


happens during the act of observation itself. At the classical level, an observation
only involves gathering information which is already present in the environment.
The idea is that a system which appears classical is never isolated from the rest
of the world—the relevant part of which we call the environment. Uncontrolled
interactions constantly spread information about the state of the system into the
environment. It is this process itself which selects which observable of the system
the environment contains information about. The conscious act of observation then
simply amounts to the observer becoming aware of this information. For instance,
any macroscopic object constantly bounces into, or emits, photons. Simply gath-
ering a few of these photons certainly has no consequence on the system, but may
yield information about the position of the object at the time of the interaction
with the photons.
   By contrast, what makes an act of observation quantum is the observer’s ability
to choose the nature of the interaction between his measurement apparatus and
the quantum system, so as to decide which observable will be measured. Hence, for
a system to appear classical, two conditions must be fulfilled: It must be continu-
ously “monitored” by its environment, and the observer must learn about it only
indirectly through the information which is already contained in the environment.
    Although the theory of decoherence has been used to tackle the infamous mea-
surement problem related to the interpretation of quantum mechanics, we are here
interested only in its ability to answer Question 1.1, i.e. to tell us which observable
of a quantum system defines its classical limit in a given context.
    Let us briefly summarize this theory here. In elementary presentations of de-
coherence [8], one considers an open quantum evolution which essentially removes
the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix ρ representing a quantum state, as
expressed in Equation 1.1. The basis involved in this expression is selected by the
dynamical process itself. Indeed, the initial states of the form ρ = |iihi| are the only
states which stay pure throughout the interaction. They are called pointer states.
In addition, if this process results from a unitary interaction with an auxiliary
quantum system, the joint final state of the two systems must be of the form
                                          X
                          U (|ψi ⊗ |0i) =      hi|ψi|ii ⊗ |φi i
                                            i


where |ψi is the initial state of the system, |0i the initial state of the auxiliary
system (the environment), |φi i some orthonormal basis of the auxiliary system,
and U the unitary operator specifying the joint evolution for some interval of time.
Such a process has been initially studied by von Neumann [12] as an example of
how a measurement apparatus can be modeled by a quantum system. Here the
measurement apparatus is the auxiliary system, or environment. This process rep-
resents a measurement of the system by the environment in the sense that a further
measurement (now in the axiomatic sense) of the environment in the basis |φi i ef-
fectively simulates a measurement of an observable of the system with eigenstates
|ii. Indeed, this measurement yields the outcome labelled by i with probability
6                                                                        Introduction


|hi|ψi|2 . The state collapses to |ii ⊗ |ψi i, which reduces to |ii when we neglect the
environment. The observable being measured is fixed only up to its eigenvalues,
because we are only interested in the probabilities  P that it defines. In general we
will simply consider a fiducial observable A = i λi |iihi| for some distinct set of
eigenvalues λi which only act as labels for the eigenvectors. We will say that the
observable A is the pointer observable.
   This is an example of a purely unitary (and hence purely quantum) process
which selects a particular observable of the system, as specified by the orthogonal
basis |ii, and transfers the information about this observable to the environment.
    Note that the evolution of the system alone is such that any quantum super-
position between the states |ii is replaced by aPsimple statistical mixture. Indeed
if the initial state is ρ = |ψihψ| where |ψi = i αi |ii, then the final state of the
system is                   X                   X
                                |iihi|ρ|iihi| =   |αi |2 |iihi|.               (1.2)
                            i                  i

    Although this model introduces some essential ideas, it is too simplistic to be
applied to realistic systems. Its main problem is that it can only explain the
selection of sharp observables, i.e. traditional observables, and not POVMs, which,
as we will argue in more detail in Section 5.1, are needed for an understanding of the
classical limit of the most common physical systems. In addition, this model does
not explain why classicality is universal at macroscopic scales, since processes of the
above kind are rather special. Finally, in this model, the effective classical system
represented by the pointer observable does not have any non-trivial dynamics.
    These points have all been addressed before (see for instance [8, 9], or the review
section in [13]). Most of these approaches consider a single non-relativistic particle
coupled via its position operator to a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. One
often assumes a Markovian approximation, which allows for the dynamics of the
system to be represented by a differential equation in time. This is important
as it removes the need for an explicit solution of the dynamics. In this picture,
decoherence is always expected to take place in the position basis, due to the local
nature of the interaction. Although such analyzes have shed important light on
many aspects of decoherence, they have important limitations. For instance, they
provide unsatisfactory, or limited answers to the following general questions. If the
decoherence takes place in the position basis, what mechanism guarantees the—
seemingly contradictory—preservation of momentum information? What singles
out momentum as the other phase-space variable? How would we recognize an
interaction which yields the emergence of a non-canonical phase-space structure?
Does this process justify one quantization process over another? How is this loss
of information in the system related to a gain of information in the environement,
i.e. a measurement? Can some quantum information be preserved in the system
despite the process of decoherence?
   Instead of attempting to improve on these models, we will adopt a new approach
which generalizes in a different way the simple model that we first described. We
Decoherence                                                                          7


will make no specific physical assumption. Instead we will show that the process of
decoherence can be understood at a very fundamental level, in terms of information
flow between the system and its environment.
    We can easily generalize von Neumann’s analysis of the process of measurement
and note that any interaction between a quantum system and another quantum
system—the environment—yields correlations which are such that a subsequent
measurement of a particular observable of the environment exactly simulates a
measurement of some observable of the system. The observable of the system
which is indirectly measured is selected by the nature of the interaction between
the two systems. Mathematically, if the initial state of the system is ρ and that
of the environment |0i, and the interaction is specified by the unitary operator U ,
then the final states of the two system is U (ρ ⊗ |0ih0|)U † . A measurement of a fixed
observable with eigenstates |ii on the environment after the interaction yields the
probabilities

                    pi = Tr((1 ⊗ |iihi|) U (ρ ⊗ |0ih0|) U † )
                      = Tr(U † (1 ⊗ |iihi|) U (ρ ⊗ |0ih0|))
                      = Tr((1 ⊗ h0|) U † (1 ⊗ |iihi|) U (1 ⊗ |0i)ρ)
                      = Tr(Ai ρ).

where we have only used the cyclicity of the trace, and defined the operators

                      Ai := (1 ⊗ h0|) U † (1 ⊗ |iihi|) U (1 ⊗ |0i)

These operators specify a generalized observable on the system, namely a discrete
POVM. Remember that we are trying to answer Question 1.1. The point of this
simple calculation is that the observable represented by the operators Ai , which is
effectively measured on the system, is fixed by the choice of the unitary operator
U , and hence by the physical interaction between the two systems.
    The problem is that the POVM which is selected in this process depends also
on the observable being measured on the environment. In the special case where
the evolution of the system alone is given by Equation 1.1, there is a unique best
observable which can be measured via the environment. “Best” in the sense that
any other observation will simply yield less information about the same observable
of the system (a concept which will be made precise in Section 5.3). However, this
is not true of the more general case considered here, as can be seen by changing
the basis |ii of the environment in the above example. Therefore, the observable
being measured in this process still depends on the good will of an observer. The
question is only shifted to another system: what compelled the observer to choose
this particular observable of the environment?
    In fact, we will show in Chapter 3 that there is only one sharp observable
(possibly trivial) which can be measured nondestructively in any such process. This
is the reason why a particular observable is indeed selected in the simpler example
defined by Equation 1.1. However, these requirements do not uniquely select a
8                                                                       Introduction


general POVM. We will see that for a POVM to be selected uniquely we need to
introduce another requirement, namely that the information about the observable
be represented redundantly in the environment.
    Redundancy was previously introduced by Ollivier et al. [14] in a slightly dif-
ferent context. The authors attempted to identify the preferred observable, not via
the full dynamical process as above, but only by the form of the final state of the
joint system and environment after the interaction. The idea is that the preferred
observable is that which is correlated with some observable of the environment.
They indeed showed that a sharp observable of the system is uniquely selected if,
in addition, these correlations are required to be redundant across many subsystems
of the environment. Our approach, although it has a different premise, will indeed
yield such correlations, hence accounting for their analysis.
    Our approach is based on a new method for characterizing the information
preserved in a quantum communication channel (see Chapter 3). The interaction
between the system and its environment, for instance, involves two main channels.
The first sends the initial state of the system to its final state. Equation 1.1 is an
example of such a channel. The concept of pointer state and its generalization [15]
is one way to characterize the information that this channel preserves. The second
important channel is the one which says how the final state of the environment
depends on the initial state of the system. This channel has rarely been considered
explicitly. However, it is important because it tells us precisely what information
the environment learns about the system, and therefore what is being measured in
the process.



1.4      Fighting decoherence
We motivated the study of decoherence by the need to understand quantization.
But understanding decoherence is also important for a completely different purpose:
that of fighting it.
    Most introductory textbooks give the impression that quantum mechanics im-
poses fundamental barriers on what it is possible to do with a physical system.
However, the restrictions introduced with quantum mechanics are restrictions on
what we can measure, or predict, but they are not restrictions on what a physical
system can do. In fact, these additional constraints on what we can observe al-
low for a greater freedom in the system’s behaviour compared to classical physics.
Indeed, quantum systems can behave in ways that were previously thought impos-
sible [16]. For instance a computer based on the principles of quantum mechanics
could solve problems which are classically intractable [17, 18]. The exact reason is
not clear, although it can be understood intuitively from the fact that a quantum
dynamical process seems to explore an infinite number of paths in parallel, in the
sense of the path-integral formalism. In fact, a naive attempt at simulating the
discrete evolution of a small finite quantum system rapidly yields an exponential
Summary                                                                               9


blow-up of the memory required to store the classical representation of the quantum
state, as well as an exponential slow-down of the simulation.
    If we want to exploit the properties of quantum systems for some practical
purpose, we have to make sure that we can maintain their quantumness, and prevent
them from undergoing decoherence. This is far from being an easy task given that
decoherence is present in every quantum experimental setups, and is typically much
faster than thermalization [8].
    One way to fight decoherence, or any other form of noise, is to simply avoid it. If
some form of noise cannot be eliminated by active control of the environment, one
may attempt to encode information in a way which will be resistant to this residual
noise. For instance, one may be able to find a subspace which is not affected by the
noise (i.e. a decoherence-free subspace) [19, 20, 21, 22]. It is possible to refine this
idea and find so-called noiseless subsystems [23, 24, 25]. A more elaborate strategy
is to find some subspaces, or subsystems, which are affected by the noise, but in a
way which can be reversed. This yields to the method of quantum error correction
[26, 27, 28, 29, 30], or to its refinement which allows for subsystem codes (operator
quantum error correction) [31, 32].
    Clearly these techniques characterize the information which is preserved by the
quantum channel representing the noise. For instance, a subspace represents a
property of the quantum system (a yes-no observable). If the effect of the noise
can be reversed on this subspace, it means in particular that the information rep-
resented by this observable has not been destroyed by the noise. This is precisely
the kind of tool that we are looking for in order to understand the process of deco-
herence. In Chapter 3, we will introduce a concept of preserved information which
is more general, and better suited for our needs. In Chapter 4 we will show how
our approach yields, as a special case, a generalization of the theory of quantum
error correction for subsystem codes [1, 2], which itself generalizes the other the-
ories mentioned above. Importantly, our approach is suitable for a study of error
correction on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this context, we show that
error correcting codes can be represented by any von Neumann algebras. Whereas
a general von Neumann algebra represents hybrid quantum-classical information,
type II and type III factors represent new exotic types of quantum codes which
exist only on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.


1.5      Summary
Let us summarize the problem at hand, and our reasoning. We want to understand
by what process a quantum system becomes effectively classical, with a focus on
the kinematical aspect of the problem. We have pointed out in Section 1.2, and will
argue in more detail in Section 5.1, that a classical limit, at the kinematical level
(i.e. everything except the dynamics), must be specified by a generalized observable
of the quantum theory. Therefore we have identified the type of object that we are
looking for: a POVM.
10                                                                    Introduction


    We also have a good idea of the type of mechanism which could be at work to
select this POVM. The theory of decoherence, which is firmly grounded in theory
and experiments, tells us that this must essentially be a measurement of the system
by its environment. An observable is indeed what characterizes the information
gathered in a measurement.
   However, we need to understand what constitutes a measurement of a quantum
system by another quantum system. We expect to be able to do so by studying the
nature of the information transmitted from one system to the other.
Chapter 2

Quantum theory

The role of this chapter is to introduce a number of basic concepts, as well as a
certain point of view on quantum mechanics which will be referred to in the rest of
this thesis. Our presentation is standard in that it follows, at least at the formal
level, the presentation given in Kraus’ lecture “States, Effects and Operations” [33],
which originates from [34]. The main difference stems in the fact that we are using
a Bayesian interpretation of probabilities rather than a frequentist one.
    The expressions “quantum mechanics” and “quantum theory” will be used inter-
changeably, just like the adjectives “quantum mechanical” and “quantum”. Some-
times, by “quantum mechanics” one refers only to Schrödinger’s model of a non-
relativistic quantum particle, so as to distinguish it from relativistic quantum field
theory. Here we refer to quantum mechanics in a much more general sense, as in the
“axioms of quantum mechanics”. For example, quantum field theory is an instance
of a quantum mechanical theory, or at least tend be so (it is not fully formalized).
Quantum theory is concerned with the common aspects of all quantum systems.
   In order to present quantum theory, we will take the view that the primary
elements of a physical theory are yes-no questions, i.e. questions with only two
possible answers, also called propositions in the field of logic, or effects in quantum
foundations. We will mostly use the term “effect” once we got used to them.
However, in the beginning we will call them “propositions” in order to remind the
reader of their interpretation. Hence, we will attach a set of propositions E to any
physical system of interest.
    Since we are going to have to deal with quantum mechanics in which uncer-
tainties are unavoidable, even in principle, we will not assume that all questions
can always be given an exact answer. Instead we assume that a typical answer will
be a degree of confidence between zero and one in the truth of the corresponding
proposition, i.e. a probability. Hence a certain state of knowledge about the system
is an assignment of a probability to each proposition:

                                    ρ : E → [0, 1].

Since all predictions of the theory are probabilities of the form ρ(α), we will assume
that two propositions α and β are identical if ρ(α) = ρ(β) for all states ρ.


2.1      Finite-dimensional quantum theory
This section is dedicated to an exposition of finite-dimensional quantum mechanics.
This will allow us to introduce most concepts which we will refer to later, while
avoiding the technical issues related to the full infinite-dimensional quantum theory,
which will be covered in Section 2.3. This presentation is not meant to be an
introduction to the subject, but rather a way to present a number of concepts
which will be used later. Hence we assume that the reader is already familiar with
the basic formalism of quantum theory, including the notion of density matrix.
   For a quantum system associated with a finite dimensional Hilbert space H, the
propositions, which are also called effects, will be assumed to be all the self-adjoint
operators with eigenvalues in the interval [0, 1]:

                         E(H) = {A ∈ M(H) | 0 ≤ A ≤ 1}

Were we wrote M(H) for the set of all linear operators on H.
   The states for this system are the functionals defined by density matrices ρ
through
                                 A 7→ Tr(ρA),
for any operator A ∈ E(H). The set of states therefore is associated with the set
of density matrices

                    S(H) = {ρ ∈ M(H) | ρ > 0 and Tr(ρ) = 1}

    We will say more about the meaning of the mathematical structures which exist
in the sets E(H) and S(H) in Section 2.2. For now we will assume that they are just
given. The purpose of this section is to show that the rest of quantum mechanics
mostly follows from interpreting these mathematical objects as propositions and
states.
    This way of looking at quantum mechanics, although it has a venerable history
[34], is not widely known. Traditionally one sees an observable   Pas a self-adjoint
operator X and postulate that its spectral decomposition X = ni=1 xi Pi must be
used to compute the probabilities Tr(ρPi ) for each outcome i = 1, . . . , n. Here, Pi
is the projector on the eigenspace of X with eigenvalue xi . Clearly, the projectors
Pi are effects, as defined above, and the probabilities are obtained by the expected
formula Tr(ρPi ). More generally one can introduce the concept of a Positive Op-
erator Valued Measure, or POVM, which generalizes this traditional concept of
observable. Indeed, if we let a quantum system interact with an auxiliary system,
and then measure a “traditional” observable on that auxiliary system, we obtain
Finite-dimensional quantum theory                                                   13


probabilities whose dependence on the state ρ of the system is given by the formula
Tr(ρAi ) where the operators Ai need not be projectors. Indeed, suppose that the
initial state of the auxiliary system is |ψi, and that the common evolution of the two
systems, until we perform the measurement, is given by the unitary time-evolution
operator U . If the eigen-projectors of the observable measured on the auxiliary
system are Pi , and if the initial state of the system is ρ, then the corresponding
probabilities are given by pi = Tr(U (ρ ⊗ |ψihψ|)U † (1 ⊗ Pi )), where the first tensor
factor corresponds to the system and the second to the auxiliary system. Using the
cyclicity of the trace, we easily see that this can be written as pi = Tr(ρAi ) where

                      Ai := (1 ⊗ hψ|)(U † (1 ⊗ Pi )U )(1 ⊗ |ψi).

In this notation, hψ| is viewed as the linear operator mapping a state |φi to the
number hψ|φi. This operator, which in finite-dimension can be seen as a matrix of
just one row, can be legally tensored with other operators. For instance, A ⊗ hψ|
maps a state |φi ⊗ |φ0 i of the two systems into a state of the first system, namely
A|φihψ|φ0 i. The ket |ψi is the adjoint of hψ| (a matrix of just one column). It maps
a complex number z to the ket z|ψi. Hence, for instance, 1 ⊗ |ψi maps a state
|φi of the system to the composite state |φi ⊗ |ψi. To see this, we interpret |φi as
|φi ⊗ 1, where 1 is the complex number one. The point is that |φi ⊗ z = z|φi ⊗ 1
for any z, which means that tensoring with a complex number does not add any
more information: it can be done freely, and simply corresponds to a different way
of representing the same Hilbert space.
    In general these operators Ai representing the discrete POVM must   P only be
self-adjoint, positive (i.e. with positive eigenvalues), and such that i Ai = 1.
This normalization condition in fact implies that the eigenvalues of Ai must also be
smaller than 1, which is what we need to make sure that Tr(ρAi ) is a probability
between 0 and 1. These operators Ai are called POVM elements, or effects, and
are indeed the operators in our set E(H). Effects P ∈ E(H) which are projectors:
P 2 = P will be called sharp. Effects which are not sharp will be called unsharp.
   Instead of referring to the standard notion of observable and POVM, let us
derive these concepts from scratch starting with the axioms that propositions are
given by the set E(H) and states by functionals of the form A 7→ Tr(ρA). This
exercise will allow us to introduce the point of view that an observable is essentially
a communication channel from a quantum to a classical system.
   Before we can define precisely what we mean by that, we first need to explain
how to model a classical system also in terms of effects and states.


2.1.1     Classical models

A classical model is always associated with a phase-space Ω. For the moment we
will ignore any mathematical structure that one may put on a phase-space, like
the canonical Poisson structure of mechanical systems. Indeed, we will consider
14                                                                  Quantum theory


contexts where Ω would not have any particular structure, for instance in the
case where it represents the internal state of a computer, and is therefore discrete.
Note that it is not usual to call Ω a phase-space when it represents a discrete
system, however it should be clear that even in that context it plays the same role
as that of a mechanical phase-space. Specifically, any element x ∈ Ω specifies a
complete knowledge about the classical system, a concept which can be understood
intuitively, but which will be made precise once we say what the effects and states
are.
    Let us assume for simplicity that Ω is a finite set. The set of propositions E(Ω)
will be the set of all functions α : Ω → [0, 1]. These functions can be seen simply
as vectors with components 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1 indexed by i ∈ Ω. The interpretation is
the following: if the system is in “state” i ∈ Ω, then the proposition α is true with
probability αi . In particular, if the components αi are either 0 or 1 then it selects
a subset ω ⊆ Ω containing only those “states” i ∈ Ω which make the proposition
α true. This corresponds to the standard notion of a logical proposition. As in
the quantum case, these special propositions will be called sharp. The constant
function with value 1 will be denoted by 1 since it plays the same role as the
identity operator in the quantum case. Indeed it is the proposition which is always
true.
    In the quantum case, we referred to the matrix algebra M(H) which is the linear
span of the set of propositions E(H). Since we will want to consider maps between
classical and quantum propositions, it is convenient to consider the equivalent of
M(H) in the classical case, namely the complex linear span of E(Ω). It consists
simply of all complex functions on Ω and will be denoted by L(Ω) for the case where
Ω is finite. L(Ω) has more in common with M(H) than the fact of being a complex
vector space: it is also an algebra in terms of the standard product of functions.
The most important difference with the set of operators M(H) is that the product
on L(Ω) is commutative. Using this product we can see that what we called classical
sharp propositions are also the only functions α which satisfy α2 = α, just like in
the quantum case. One can also introduce the concept of an adjoint. The adjoint
f ∗ of a function f is simply its complex conjugate f , so that the real functions
are also the self-adjoint functions. For instance, the components of an effect α
satisfy (α∗ )i = αi = αi . We see that the range of a function α ∈ L(Ω) plays the
same role as the set of eigenvalues of an operator A ∈ M(H). Indeed the classical
propositions are the self-adjoint, i.e. real, functions with range inside [0, 1]. In
fact this algebra structure together with the operation of taking the adjoint (“star”
operation ), makes L(Ω) into the mathematical structure called a C∗ -algebra, which
captures precisely that which is common between quantum and classical systems.
Indeed M(H) is a C∗ -algebra as well. We will see that the systems represented by
other types of C∗ -algebras are in a sense intermediate between being quantum and
classical systems, and will come up naturally once we consider the many ways that
quantum information can be degraded by noise.
   Classical states are of course represented by probability distributions
                                                                      P on Ω, i.e.
functions µ : Ω → [0, 1] which are normalized by the condition          i∈Ω µi = 1.

A probability
     P         distribution µ represents the functional on proposition defined by
α 7→ i αi µi . Just as in the quantum case, the states S(Ω) can be represented by
positive elements of the algebra L(Ω):
                                                   X
                    S(Ω) = {µ ∈ L(Ω) | µ > 0 and       µi = 1}.
                                                     i∈Ω

    In fact, a classical system can also be represented as a quantum system with
some constraints on the states that it can take. Indeed, if Ω contains n elements,
the algebra L(Ω) can be viewed as the set of all diagonal complex n-by-n matrices.
The algebra operations, including the star operation (adjoint), are then exactly
the quantum ones. In this representation, using the bra-ket
                                                       P      notation of quantum
mechanics, we can write classical propositions as α = i∈Ω αi |iihi|. This is in fact
the way that one often deal with classical systems in quantum information theory
(for instance this is what is done in [35]). This notation has the advantage of
directly allowing one to deal with the interaction between coexistent quantum and
classical systems while working entirely within the formalism of quantum theory.


2.1.2    Observables as quantum-to-classical maps
In general we assume that we know how to observe a classical system. This means
that if a classical system characterized by the phase-space Ω is given, it is assumed
by default that we are also given an interpretational framework which tells us what
the propositions E(Ω) actually mean in terms of possible experimental devices.
Said differently, we assume that we would know how to conceive experiments which
would test the propositions represented by the effect in E(Ω).
    In addition, it seems reasonable to say that we only directly observe classical
objects, i.e. objects which are understood and modeled in classical terms, rather
than quantum objects. This means that if we want to make any kind of observation
of a quantum system, we need to somehow couple it to a measurement apparatus,
a part of which is a classical system that we directly observe. This classical part
of the measurement apparatus which is pertinent in giving us the outcome of the
experiment will be called the pointer. Hence we assume that we can answer any
question (i.e. proposition) about the state of the measurement apparatus’ classical
pointer, and that the answers to these questions somehow convey information about
propositions of the quantum systems. Let Ω be the phase space for the classical
pointer, and H the Hilbert space of the quantum system under observation. We will
not need to consider the details of how these two systems might interact. Instead
we consider the most general way that propositions about Ω can be translated to
propositions about H. The translation “table” must be given by a map
                                X ∗ : E(Ω) → E(H).
The reason for the star will be explained later. This is indeed how we will represent
an observable on H, with “spectrum” Ω (i.e. the set of values it can take). However
we need some additional constraints on this map.
16                                                                  Quantum theory


    Suppose that we have some knowledge about the quantum system represented
by a state ρ ∈ S(H). This knowledge should allow us to make some prediction
about the classical system, i.e. it should translate into some knowledge about
the measurement apparatus’ pointer, represented by a classical state µ ∈ S(Ω).
Mathematically, this is indeed what we get by using X ∗ to “pull back” the states of
the quantum system, which are functionals on E(H). Remember that the density
ρ represents the functional which sends A to Tr(ρA), for any A ∈ E(H). Since a
classical proposition α is mapped to the quantum proposition X ∗ (α), we indirectly
get the function µ : α 7→ Tr(ρ(X ∗ (α)) on classical observables. However, for this
functional to be a valid classical state, it has to satisfy certain conditions. In
particular, classical states are linear functionals. This means that for any two
effects α, β ∈ E(Ω), and complex numbers x, y, we must have
               Tr(ρ(X ∗ (xα + yβ)) = xTr(ρ(X ∗ (α)) + yTr(ρ(X ∗ (β))
                                   = Tr(ρ(xX ∗ (α) + yX ∗ (β))).
Since this equation must be true for all quantum states ρ, it implies the operator
equation
                       X ∗ (xα + yβ) = xX ∗ (α) + yX ∗ (β)
Hence X ∗ itself must be linear. Because of this property it extends uniquely to a
linear map
                               X ∗ : L(Ω) → M(H).
We note this fact because it is convenient to work with linear spaces. However X ∗
cannot be any linear map, it must also send E(Ω) ⊂ L(Ω) entirely into E(H) ⊂
M(H). This is exactly guaranteed if we require that it be positive, i.e. that it sends
positive functions on Ω to positive operators on H, and that in addition X ∗ (1) ≤ 1,
i.e. that the eigenvalues of X ∗ (1) be all smaller than 1. However, we must also
require that it sends quantum states to properly normalized functionals on Ω, i.e.
Tr(ρX ∗ (1)) = 1 = Tr(ρ1) for all ρ, which implies
                                     X ∗ (1) = 1.
We summarize this condition by saying that X ∗ is unital . Hence, the observables
must be represented by linear, positive and unital maps X ∗ . These conditions are
all we need on X ∗ to make sure that it induces a valid map from quantum state to
classical states, which we will write as X. Consequently, the map X is also linear: it
is indeed the linear dual of X ∗ . Since we are working with finite-dimensional vector
spaces, X ∗ is also the dual of X, which justifies the star. The infinite-dimensional
case will eventually justify our choice of putting the star on the map which acts on
propositions, rather than on that map which acts on states.
     Summarizing, the dual map
                                 X : S(H) → S(Ω)
which pulls quantum states back to classical states, is the restriction to S(Ω) ⊆ L(Ω)
of the linear map
                               X : M(H) → L(Ω).
Finite-dimensional quantum theory                                                    17


The map X ∗ could be specified simply as the dual of X. Just as X ∗ needs to be
positive, X also must be positive. Indeed it must send quantum states, which are
positive operators, to classical states which are positive functions. The condition
X ∗ (1) = 1 however takes a different form in terms of X. Recall that we arrived
at this equationPby requiring that X preserves the normalization of states, i.e. if
µ = X(ρ) then i µi = Tr(ρ).
     Let us now give a simple representation for the linear maps from L(Ω) to M(H).
Since they are linear, they can be characterized by their action on a basis of L(Ω).
We will use the canonical basis formed by the functions χi (j)P := δij . The action of
X ∗ on any classical proposition α is, by linearity, X ∗ (α) = i αi X ∗ (χi ). Hence X ∗
                                                         ∗                      ∗
is entirely
       P specified∗ by the family of effects Xi := X (χi ). The condition X (1) = 1
reads
P         i Xi = X (1) = 1. Reciprocally, any family of propositions Xi such that
   i Xi = 1 defines an observable through
                                             X
                                  X ∗ (α) :=    α i Xi .
                                             i

The dual X then sends the quantum P state ρ to the   classical
                                                            P state µ which maps a
                                                   ∗
proposition α to the probability i αi µi = Tr(ρX (α)) = i αi Tr(ρXi ). Hence X
sends ρ to the probability distribution µ defined by
                                    µi = Tr(ρXi ).
                condition X ∗ (1) = 1, which is equivalent to
                                                                P
The unitality P                                                    i Xi = 1, is
                                                                              Palso
equivalent to     i µi = Tr(ρ). Let us define the classical
                                                       P trace Tr(µ) :=         i µi .
Note that it is indeed the trace of the diagonal matrix i µi |iihi| which represents
the
P classical state as a quantum state. Hence we can summarize the condition
  i µi = Tr(ρ) by saying that X is trace-preserving.

    This shows, at least in finite dimension and for a finite number of outcomes,
that this notion of observable is equivalent to that of Positive Operator-Valued
measure (POVM). Indeed, a POVM which represents an observable with only a
finite number of outcomes belongingPto the set Ω can be defined as a family of
propositions Ai ∈ M(H) such that i∈Ω Ai = 1. The interpretation associated
with it is that, if ρ is the state of the system, then the outcome labelled by i is true
with probability Tr(ρAi ), which is precisely what we obtained for our concept of
observable.
   Note that effects are one-to-one with a particular class of observables, namely
observables with two values, i.e. defined for Ω = {0, 1}. Indeed, given any effect
A ∈ E(H), one can define the observable X : L({0, 1}) → E(H) by
                 X0 = X ∗ (χ0 ) = A and X1 = X ∗ (χ1 ) = 1 − A.
This gives a particular interpretation for the effect 1 − A: it is the alternative to A
in an observation of A.
   Let us also show how we can recover the more conservative notion of observable,
namely what we will call sharp observables. A sharp observable X is an observable
18                                                                         Quantum theory


which maps sharp effects to sharp effects, i.e. such that for all sharp classical effect
χω (the characteristic function for a subset ω ⊆ Ω), the image X ∗ (χω ) is a projector,
i.e. (X ∗ (χω ))2 = X ∗ (χω ). In fact this is equivalent to requiring that Xi2 = P Xi for all
                       2                       2
i ∈ Ω. Indeed,
             P    if X i = X  i , then X i − X i = (1 − X i )X i = 0. But 1 − X i =   j6=i Xj .
Hence also j6=i Xi Xj Xi = 0. Since this is a sum of positive operators, this implies
that Xi Xj Xi = (Xi Xj )∗ (Xi Xj ) = 0 for all j, which in turn implies Xj Xi = 0 for
all i and j.PFrom the orthogonality of the effects Xi it is easy to see than any sum
X ∗ (χω ) = i∈ω Xi is a projector as well.
    In fact, this also proves that these projectors
                                                 P are automatically orthogonal.
Since also they are complete in the sense that i Xi = 1, then they can  P be seen
as the projectors on the eigenspaces of a self-adjoint operator A =       i∈Ω λi Xi ,
which is indeed the standard notion of an observable. Here λi can be any family of
distinct realPnumbers. In fact, to be pedantic, we could make sure that Ω ⊂ R and
write A = λ∈Ω λXi . However the actual eigenvalues matter little for a discrete
observable.


2.1.3      Capacity of an observable
Intuitively, measuring a sharp observable should yield more information about the
system than measuring an unsharp one, provided that they have the same number
of outcomes. Viewing observables as communication channels yields a natural way
to make this concept precise, namely the information capacity of an observable.
    The idea is the following. Suppose that Alice can prepare a given quantum
system in any state she wants, and Bob is going to measure the observable X of
this system. If the two can agree of a protocol beforehand, how many bits can
Alice communicate in this way to Bob? In order to make this more precise, one
must consider that they will actually use an arbitrary large number of systems,
and see how many bits Alice can transmit per system, in average, as the number
of systems goes to infinity. This is a direct parallel to the definition of capacity
for a classical channel. In fact, it can be reduced to it, as shown by the Holevo-
Schumacher-Westmorland (HSW) theorem [35].
    Indeed, the process by which Alice will encode her classical bits into a quantum
state is itself a channel, in this case a classical-to-quantum channel, also called a
state-preparation procedure. Let us call such a channel φ. Since φ is linear and
acts on L(Ω), it can be characterized by its action on the basis states χi . Let us
write ρi = φ(χi ) for the quantum
                               P states which are image of these basis states. For
a general classical state µ = i µi χi , we have
                                            X
                                    φ(µ) =      µi ρ i .
                                                i


   If we compose this classical-to-quantum channel φ with the quantum-to-classical
channel X, we obtain simply a classical channel X ◦φ, for which a Shannon capacity
Finite-dimensional quantum theory                                                                      19


C(X◦φ) can be computed. The HSW theorem then states that the classical capacity
of the channel X is given by
                                        C(X) = sup C(X ◦ φ).
                                                           φ


   Since the HSW theorem is usually expressed for general quantum channel, this
formulation is not usual. Let us therefore show that this is indeed equivalent to the
formula given in [35], namely
                                     X              X             
                  C(X) = sup S(X(         µi ρ i ) −   µi S(X(ρi ))             (2.1)
                                µi ρi
                                                       i                i

Where, by S(µ), we mean the von-Neumann entropy of the quantum state whose
eigenvalues are given by the classical distribution µ, which is simply the Shannon
entropy of µ: S(µ) = H(µ).
    Note that C(X ◦ φ) is the maximum over all initial states µ of the mutual
information for the joint probability p(i, j) of getting outcome χj and input χi . This
joint probability is given by p(j|i)µi , where p(j|i) = X(φ(χi ))j is the probability to
get outcome χjPgiven that the input was    P χi . Therefore p(i, j) = X(φ(χi ))j µi and
has marginals j X(φ(χi ))j = µi and i X(φ(χi ))j µi = X(φ(µ))j . We therefore
have
                    C(X ◦ φ) = sup[H(X(φ(µ))) + H(µ) − H(p)].
                                            µ

But note that
                                        X                          X
            H(µ) − H(p) = −                      µi log2 (µi ) +            p(i, j) log2 (p(i, j))

                                            i                           j

                                =           µi         p(j|i) log2 (p(j|i))
                                    i             j

                                            i

and so,
                                                                               X
          C(X) = sup C(X ◦ φ) = sup[H(X(φ(µ))) −                                    µi H(X(φ(χi )))]
                     φ                           φ,µi
                          X           X              
                = sup S(X(  µi ρi )) −   µi H(X(ρi ))
                   µi ,ρi
                                        i                      i

which is indeed equal to Equation 2.1.
    When applied to a discrete sharp observable, this quantity is equal to the loga-
rithm of the number of outcomes. Indeed, if X is sharp, then the optimal strategy
for Alice consists in encoding her classical states into eigenstates of X. The number
of states that she can encode in this way is the number of distinct eigenstates n of
X. This corresponds to log2 (n) bits.
20                                                                    Quantum theory


2.1.4     Quantum channels
We want to consider the most general way that a quantum system B can encode
information about another quantum system A, as specified by a map
                                 E ∗ : E(HB ) → E(HA )
 which translates each proposition on system B into a proposition of system A. All
the points made in the discussion of observables are still valid here, even though
we have replaced the classical system by the quantum system B. Indeed the only
algebraic properties of states and effects that we have used in our presentation
involved the linearity and the positivity of effects and states, which form the same
algebraic structure in the quantum and in the classical case (more will be said about
what this structure is in Section 2.3). Hence the most general such map E ∗ , which
is also required to induce a valid map from states of system A to states of system
B, must extend to a unital positive linear map
                               E ∗ : M(HB ) → M(HA ).
This map is the dual of a trace-preserving positive linear map
                                E : M(HA ) → M(HB )
which maps states of A to states of B. The relation between the two can be simply
expressed from the fact that they yield the same probabilities:
                               Tr(E(ρ)A) = Tr(ρE ∗ (A))
for all states ρ and all effects A.
    However we need another important condition which happens to be implicitly
satisfied in the case of the quantum-to-classical maps which define observables. We
need to make sure that if our systems A and B were only parts of larger systems,
then our map could be trivially extended to those larger systems. This means
that, if we add a third system C with Hilbert space HC , then the map E ∗ ⊗ id from
M(HA ⊗HC ) to M(HB ⊗HC ) defined by (E ∗ ⊗id)(X ⊗Y ) := E ∗ (X)⊗Y , should also
be unital, positive and linear. Unitality and linearity come for free. However the
positivity must be postulated. If E ∗ ⊗ id is positive no matter what the dimension
of the auxiliary system C is, then we say that E ∗ is completely positive. In this case,
the dual E ⊗ id is also automatically completely positive. This condition is not only
physically reasonable, but also mathematically extremely useful since it allows one
to apply a powerful representation theorem by Choi [36], which states that there is
a family of operators Ek (the channel’s elements) such that
                                           X
                                 E ∗ (X) =    Ek∗ XEk
                                            k

from which it is easy to see that also
                                           X
                                  E(ρ) =        Ek ρEk∗ .

In fact any map of this form is completely positive (and of course linear). Unitality
of E ∗ requires in addition that
                                         X
                               E ∗ (1) =   Ek∗ Ek = 1.

Let us state and prove Choi’s theorem for completeness.
Theorem 2.1. A linear map E from P           M(HA ) to M(HB ) is completely positive
if and only if it has the form E(ρ) = k Ek ρEk∗ for a family of linear operators
Ek : HA → HB .
                                                                  ∗
                                                          P
                       P that a ∗map defined by E(ρ) = k Ek ρEk is positive. Indeed,
Proof. First, it is clear
if ρ is positive then k Ek ρEk is a sum ofPpositive operators, which is also positive.
In addition, its extension (E ⊗ id)(ρ) = k (Ek ⊗ 1)ρ(Ek ⊗ 1)∗ has the same form
and is therefore positive too, which show that E is completely positive. For the
converse, suppose that E is completely positive. Let us view E as going from the
complement of its kernel ker(E)⊥ to its range ran(E). Since these subspaces have
equal dimensions, they can be both identified with the same space H. Consider
aPbasis |ii of H. Consider also the Hilbert space H ⊗ H and the operator A :=
   ij |iihj| ⊗ |jihi| acting on it. Note that A is positive. Indeed for any state
|Ψi := |ψi ⊗ |φi with components ψi φj := hi|ψihj|φi, we have
                                                        !          !
                            X                 X            X
                hΨ|A|Ψi =      ψ i ψj φj φi =    ψ i φi      ψ j φj ≥ 0
                           ij                        i                 j

Since E is completely positive, (E ⊗ id)(A) is a positive operator on HA ⊗ HB .
Therefore it has a complete set of orthogonal eigenvectors |vk i ∈ HA ⊗ HB . This
means that it can be written as
                                          X
                            (E ⊗ id)(A) =     |vk ihvk |
                                                      k

where the norm of the vector |vi i is the square of the corresponding eigenvalue.
Explicitly this means that
                        X                       X
                           E(|iihj|) ⊗ |jihi| =   |vk ihvk |
                          ij                               k

by multiplying by 1 ⊗ hj| on the left and 1 ⊗ |ii on the right we get
                                 X
                     E(|iihj|) =     (1 ⊗ hj|)|vk ihvk |(1 ⊗ |ii)
                                         k

which is equivalent to
                                    X
                   E(|iihj|) =           hvk |(|lihl| ⊗ |iihj|)|vk i
                                    lk
                                    X
                                =        hvk |(|lihl| ⊗ |iihj|)|vk i
                                    lk
                                    X
                                =        hvk |(|li ⊗ 1) |iihj| (hl| ⊗ 1)|vk i
                                    lk
22                                                                    Quantum theory


But since |iihj| form a basis of all operators on H, we have by linearity
                                X
                        E(ρ) =      hvk |(|li ⊗ 1) ρ (hl| ⊗ 1)|vk i
                                 lk

for any operator ρ on H. This is the representation that we seeked, with elements

                                 Ekl := hvk |(|li ⊗ 1).



    Such a map between states, namely a trace-preserving completely-positive linear
map, will be called a quantum channel, or simply a channel. In order to avoid
confusion, we will only call a channel the map E on states. E ∗ will simply be called
its dual. We may also call an observable X a quantum-to-classical channel since it
sends quantum states to classical states.


2.1.5     Transformation of observables: the Heisenberg pic-
          ture
All observables X are basically made out of effects, namely those in the image
of X ∗ : X ∗ (α) ∈ E(H). For convenience, we will refer to them as the effects of
X. Since the dual of a channel maps effects to effects, it also maps observables to
observables. Indeed, consider the observable Y ∗ defined by Y ∗ (α) := E ∗ (X ∗ (α)) for
all classical effects α. To see that Y ∗ is indeed an observable, simply note that it
is unital, positive and linear, because both E ∗ and X ∗ are. This equation can also
be written as
                           Y ∗ = E ∗ ◦ X ∗ or Y = X ◦ E
or simply in terms of the elements Yi = Y ∗ (χi ) and Xi = X ∗ (χi ) as

                                      Yi = E ∗ (Xi )

An alternative way of writing this equation, which is intuitively helpful, is as a
commutative diagram showing the flow of information between states of the three
systems involved, namely the source quantum system A, the target quantum system
B, and the classical pointer Ω.
                                            E-
                               M(HA )            M(HB )

                                                       Y
                                          X
                                                  -
                                                       ?
                                                   L(Ω)
Each object can be seen as a physical system, be it quantum or classical, and each
arrow as a transfer of information between systems. An arrow from a quantum to
Finite-dimensional quantum theory                                                   23


a classical system corresponds to an observation. We will see later that this can be
formally seen as a diagram in the category where the objects are the pre-dual of
von Neumann algebras and the morphisms the trace-preserving completely-positive
linear maps between them. The correct way to read such a diagram is as a set of
equations stating that each possible path between two objects are equal.
    This is how the channel E acts on observables. In the case where E represents
some time evolution for a certain interval of time, this is simply the Heisenberg
picture. Indeed, in the case of a unitary evolution Ut , remember that we get the
Heisenberg picture by noting that what matters are expectation values of the form
hψ(t)|A|ψ(t)i for a self-adjoint operator A representing a sharp observable, and for
the time-dependant state |ψ(t)i = Ut |ψi. These expectation values can alterna-
tively be written as hψ|Ut∗ AUt |ψi = hψ|A(t)|ψi, where we defined A(t) := Ut∗ AUt .
Hence we can either assume that our knowledge represented by the states evolves
as a function of time (the Schrödinger picture), or alternatively assume that our
knowledge is fixed, but that it is our interpretation of what the observables are
which changes with time: a point of view called the Heisenberg picture. A channel
E specifies a more general type of evolution, however the scheme is the same. We
took the more general expectations values (probabilities) of the form Tr(ρA) as the
fundamental predictions of the theory, and noted that a given map E ∗ on effects also
induces a map E on states through the relation Tr(E(ρ)A) = Tr(ρE ∗ (A)). Hence
the map E ∗ , which says how effects evolve in the case of a fixed state, specifies
the evolution in the Heisenberg picture. However, writing an observable X as a
channel, rather than in terms of its elementary effect Xi , we can also write the
Heisenberg evolution using the “Schrödinger” channel E, as X 7→ Y = X ◦ E.
    However there is something that this more general picture renders apparent
which is normally overlooked in the unitary case. It should be clear by now that
if the channel maps states of a system A to states of another system B, then the
effect of the channel in the dual Heisenberg picture is to map observables of B to
observable of A, i.e. it goes “backward”. This can also be seen by looking at what
happens if we compose two channels E and E 0 . We get the new channel E 0 ◦ E.
But in the Heisenberg picture the action is given by (E 0 ◦ E)∗ = E ∗ ◦ (E 0 )∗ . Hence
in the Heisenberg picture we have to apply the latest channel first. If the channel
represents a time evolution, one way to interpret this is to think of the observable
Y = X ◦ E as that which, if measured at the initial time, would yield the same
result as X measured at the later time.


2.1.6     Measurements

We have argued that the most general way that a classical system with phase-space
Ω can hold information about a quantum system defined by the Hilbert space H, is
specified by a trace-preserving linear map X : M(H) → L(Ω). But if we actually
perform this measurement, we may expect that the quantum system that we have
measured still exists afterward. This means that the process of measurement should
24                                                                   Quantum theory


map the state of our system not only to the state of our measurement apparatus’
pointer, but also to the later state of the system itself as well. Hence it should be
a channel
                            E : M(H) → M(H) ⊗ L(Ω)
with dual
                               E ∗ : M(H) ⊗ L(Ω) → M(H)
where H is the Hilbert space of our quantum system and Ω the phase-space of the
measurement apparatus’ pointer.
    In order to see what the tensor product between a quantum and a classical
system is, consider the representation of classical states and classical effects as di-
agonal quantum states and diagonalPquantum effects. For instance, the classical
effect α can be represented as α = i∈Ω P αi |iihi|. Its tensor product with a quan-
tum effect A then is simply A ⊗ α = i∈Ω αi A ⊗ |iihi|. This shows that in this
representation, the space M(H) ⊗ L(Ω) consists of block-diagonal matrices. It is
in fact a subalgebra of the algebra of full matrices. It defines in its own right a
physical system which is not quantum nor classical, but hybrid quantum-classical.
We will see more general structures of this type in Section 2.3 where they will be
formalized as C∗ -algebras.
   For the process represented by E to represents the measurement of a specific
observable X we require that

                                   E ∗ (1 ⊗ α) = X ∗ (α)                          (2.2)

for any classical effect α ∈ E(Ω). Indeed, 1⊗α is an effect on the joint system which
simply ignores the quantum system, since 1 is true no matter what the state of the
quantum system is. Note that the dual of the completely positive map α 7→ 1 ⊗ α is
the partial trace over the quantum system. Indeed, given a basis |ii of the quantum
system, we can write this channel explicitly in terms of its elements:
                           X               X
                      α 7→    |iihi| ⊗ α =   (|ii ⊗ 1) α (hi| ⊗ 1).
                           i                  i

We therefore immediately obtain the dual map on states by swapping the elements:
                 X                             X
        ρ ⊗ µ 7→   (hi| ⊗ 1)(ρ ⊗ µ)(|ii ⊗ 1) =   hi|ρ|ii µ = Tr(ρ)µ = µ.
                    i                                  i


    Equation 2.2 implies that E ∗ (1 ⊗ χi ) = Xi for all i ∈ Ω. Note that the maps Fi∗
defined by
                               Fi∗ (A) := E ∗ (A ⊗ χi )
from M(H) to itself are completely positive, although not unital. These maps can
be anything apart from the requirement given by Equation 2.2, which is

                                      Fi∗ (1) = Xi .
Finite-dimensional quantum theory                                                  25


Hence the most general form of a measurement of the observable X is as a map
                                         X
                           E ∗ (A ⊗ α) =   αi Fi∗ (A)
                                                 i

for some completely positive maps Fi∗ which satisfy Fi∗ (1) = Xi . The dual E is
given by                            X
                             E(ρ) =    Fi (ρ) ⊗ χi .
                                          i

If we representP
               the classical system as a diagonal quantum system, we could write
this as E(ρ) = i Fi (ρ) ⊗ |iihi|.
    Hence, if our knowledge of the system was represented by ρ, then after it has
interacted with the measurement device,
                                   P     our joint knowledge of the system and the
pointer is represented by the state i Fi (ρ) ⊗ χi . In order to see what this implies,
let us consider a second measurement after this one.


2.1.7     Repeated measurements and collapse
Suppose that we perform a measurement of X as specified above, followed by a
measurement of a second observable X 0 associated with the phase-space Ω0 . By
composing the measurement E with the channel X 0 applied on the final state of the
quantum system, we obtain the purely classical state µ of the two pointers:
                  X                      X
              µ=     X 0 (Mi (ρ)) ⊗ χi =    Tr(Fi (ρ)Xj0 )(χj ⊗ χi )
                     i                           ij

This is simply the functional way of writing the joint probability distribution

                                 µij = Tr(Fi (ρ)Xj0 )

where i ∈ Ω is the outcome of the first measurement and j ∈ Ω0 the outcome of the
second. From this joint probability distribution we can compute the conditional
probability p(j|i) of obtaining outcome j ∈ Ω0 in the second measurement, knowing
that the outcome of the first measurement was i ∈ Ω:
                                    µij     Tr(Fi (ρ)Xj0 )
                          p(j|i) = P      =
                                    j µij    Tr(Fi (ρ))
                                 = Tr(ρi Xj0 )

where we have introduced the quantum states
                                            Fi (ρ)
                                  ρi :=              .
                                          Tr(Fi (ρ))

Since X 0 is not involved in the definition of ρi , we see that after the measurement
of X, and the finding of the measurement apparatus’ pointer in state i ∈ Ω, our
26                                                                    Quantum theory


knowledge about the quantum system can be updated to the new state ρi , which
has the usual form given by the collapse postulate.
    For instance, if the observable X is sharp, in the sense that all the effects Xi = Pi
are sharp: Pi2 = Pi , then one possible choice of measurement apparatus is given by

                                    Fi (ρ) := Pi ρPi

This indeed defines a measurement of X, since Fi∗ (1) = Pi2 = Pi . We then obtain
the usual state update formula

                                             Pi ρPi
                                     ρi =            .
                                            Tr(Pi ρ)


2.2      Effect algebras
This section is meant to give some logical motivations for the mathematical struc-
tures that we postulated on both the quantum and classical sets of propositions.
It is interesting to note that a physical transformation (channel) is not required to
completely preserve all of these structures. For instance, the product of effects need
not be preserved. The main algebraic structure which is preserved is the addition
of effects. We introduce here one program of axiomatization of quantum mechanics
which is based on this structure [37].
    Let us suppose that the set E represents the propositions associated with some
physical system. We assume that we also have a set of states S on it, which assign
a probability to each proposition. We want to define on E a generalization of the
logical “or” between disjoint propositions. We write γ = α+β for three propositions
α, β and γ whenever ρ(γ) = ρ(α) + ρ(β) for all states ρ. Addition of probabilities
is indeed what we expect for the logical disjunction of two propositions. In general,
the sum α+β cannot be defined for all pairs of propositions β and α since ρ(α)+ρ(β)
might be greater than 1. Pairs of propositions for which the sum exists will be said
to be valid alternatives. The sum α + β, when it exists, can always be assumed to
be unique, given that the corresponding probabilities are defined uniquely by the
relation ρ(α + β) = ρ(α) + ρ(β) for any state ρ.
    One property that we get for free from this definition is that α + β = β + α.
Many interesting results can be obtained with this structure if we postulate a few
useful axioms which make E into an effect algebra [37]. In order to get a sort of
associativity, we assume that if α + β and γ + (α + β) are defined, then (γ + α) + β
is defined too. From the definition of the addition as it relates to states, we get
(γ +α)+β = γ +(α+β). Next we postulate that there are two special propositions:
the proposition 0 which is always false, i.e. ρ(0) = 0 for any state ρ, and the
proposition 1 which is always true, i.e. ρ(1) = 1 for any state ρ. We then assume
that for any proposition α, there is a proposition β such that α + β = 1. β can be
written as β = 1−α. It can be interpreted as the negation of α. Indeed for any state
Effect algebras                                                                    27


ρ such that ρ(α) = 1, we have ρ(1 − α) + ρ(α) = ρ(1) = 1. Hence ρ(1 − α) + 1 = 1,
which implies ρ(1−α) = 0. This shows that the complement 1−α is false whenever
α is true. Conversely we also have that 1 − α is true whenever α is false, which is
what we expect of the negation of α.
    The last axiom needed to define an effect algebra is that 1 + α exists only for
α = 0. In addition, we assume for the moment that there are no other restrictions
on states other than those implied in the definition of +, 0 and 1. This means that
the set of states consists of all the functions ρ from E to the interval [0, 1] which
are such that ρ(α) + ρ(β) = ρ(α + β), ρ(0) = 0 and ρ(1) = 1.
    An interesting property of an effect algebra is that it automatically comes with
a partial order defined by α < β whenever γ + α = β for some proposition γ. This
relation can be understood as a form of logical implication from α to β. Indeed
for any state ρ such that ρ(α) = 1, i.e. any state for which α is true, we have
0 ≤ ρ(β − α) = ρ(β) − ρ(α) = ρ(β) − 1. Hence 1 ≥ ρ(β) ≥ 1, which implies
ρ(β) = 1, i.e. β is true. Hence α implies β.


2.2.1     Linear effect algebras
The effects algebras of quantum and classical systems have an additional simple
structure in common which makes the above axioms more concrete and easier to
understand.
   Suppose that we are given an ordered vector space V with a special element
e > 0. An ordered vector space is a vector space with a partial order ≤ satisfying
u ≤ v if and only if 0 ≤ v − u, and 0 ≤ λv for all 0 ≤ v and λ ∈ R+ . Then an effect
algebra is automatically formed by those elements of V which are larger than the
zero vector 0 and smaller than e:

                           E(V ) := {α ∈ V | 0 ≤ α ≤ e}.

 This set E(V ) is an effect algebra for the partially-defined addition defined by the
addition of vectors, with the false proposition given by the zero vector and the true
proposition given by the specially chosen vector e. The natural partial order of
this effect algebra is of course the one which we started from. Hence what we have
done was to use the partial order to tell which vectors can be added. Indeed we
have that α + β exists exactly when α + β ≤ 1. Such a structure is called a linear
effect algebra [38]. Note that since we are only interested in the vector space in the
extent that it defines the effect algebra, we will always assume that V is the span
of the effect algebra E(V ).
    Note that the states are automatically given by linear maps on V . Indeed, a state
ρ is required to satisfy ρ(α + β) = ρ(α) + ρ(β) for any effects α and β. This means
that for any positive integer n such that nα ≤ 1, we must have ρ(nα) = nρ(α).
In addition, for any positive integer m we have α = m m1 α, hence ρ(α) = mρ( m1 α),
which implies ρ( m1 α) = m1 ρ(α). Combining the two results, for any positive rational
28                                                                  Quantum theory


      n
q=m     and effect α such that qα ≤ 1, we have ρ(qα) = qρ(α). In addition, note that
α < β implies ρ(α) ≤ ρ(β). Indeed, α < β means that there exists 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 such
that α + γ = β, from which we have ρ(α) + ρ(γ) = ρ(β), and hence, ρ(α) ≤ ρ(β).
Now for any real 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, consider a sequence 0 ≤ qn ≤ r ∈ Q and a sequence
1 ≥ qn0 ≥ r ∈ Q both converging to r. We have qn ρ(α) = ρ(qn α) ≤ ρ(rα) ≤
ρ(qn0 α) = qn0 ρ(α) for all n. In the limit, this implies rρ(α) = ρ(rα).


2.2.2     Morphisms between effect algebras
We want to consider maps between two effect algebras:
                                    φ : EB → EA
We have seen that once we specialize to quantum and classical systems, the inter-
esting maps are those which preserve the addition of effects, i.e. φ(α) + φ(β) is
defined whenever α + β is, and
                              φ(α + β) = φ(α) + φ(β)
This automatically implies that φ(0) = 0. But in addition we require that
                                      φ(1) = 1.
These assumptions are what we need for the map φ to make sense as a transfor-
mation of states. Indeed, consider a state ρA of EA . We automatically obtain a
function ρB on EB defined by ρB (αB ) = ρA (φ(αB )), i.e.
                                 ρA 7→ ρB = ρA ◦ φ
Although the function ρB is always defined, it may not be a state. It will be a
state if it satisfies ρB (α + β) = ρB (α) + ρB (β) and ρB (1) = 1. The first condition
implies that ρA (φ(α + β)) = ρA (φ(α)) + ρA (φ(β)) for all ρA , which implies that
φ(α+β) = φ(α)+φ(β). From the second condition we have 1 = ρB (1) = ρA (φ(1)) =
ρA (1) for all ρA , which implies φ(1) = 1. Maps φ having these properties will be
called morphisms as they preserve all the structures of the effect algebras. They
correspond to the most general transformations which maps states of A to states
of B and effects of B to effects of A.
    For both quantum and classical systems, these morphisms almost define what
the possible physical transformations are. In the quantum case we will just need
one additional assumption which will be that φ must also be a morphism if the
system of interest is only part of a larger system. However, we have not introduced
the structure needed in order to define a subsystem in this abstract framework. In
fact, the question of what structure one needs to add to an abstract effect algebra,
if any, in order to define this concept, is an open research problem.
   If E(VA ) and E(VB ) are two linear effect algebras built respectively from the
vectors spaces VA and VB , then the morphisms are the linear maps φ from VB to VA
which are positive, and such that φ(1) = 1. The map φ is called positive if φ(α) ≥ 0
whenever α ≥ 0. This is all that is required for φ to preserve the order structure
and therefore the induced effect algebra structure.
Effect algebras                                                                     29


2.2.3     States
Let us say a little bit more about states. Note that the real interval [0, 1] itself is
a linear effect algebra in terms of the addition of real numbers, and the natural
complete order of real numbers. Hence the set of states on an effect algebra E is
simply the set of morphisms from E to [0, 1].
    If E is a linear effect algebra spanning the vector space V then the states are
elements of the dual space V ∗ . For instance, when V is finite-dimensional, V ∗ is a
vector space of same dimension as V . Note that V ∗ is an ordered vector space like
V . Indeed, for an elements ρ ∈ V ∗ , we have ρ ≥ 0 if ρ(α) ≥ 0 for all α ≥ 0. This is
of course the kind of positivity which is required of a state ρ. Therefore states are
positive elements of the dual space V ∗ . In addition we have to require ρ(1) = 1. In
order to make connection with what follows, let us define the trace of an element
ρ ∈ V ∗ as
                                     Tr(ρ) := ρ(1).
Then we can write the set of states as
                      S(V ) = {ρ ∈ V ∗ | ρ ≥ 0 and Tr(ρ) = 1}

    Remember that a morphism φ between two effect algebras acts on states through
ρ 7→ ρ◦φ. This map defines the linear dual φ∗ (ρ) = ρ◦φ. The positivity of φ, which
is defined by φ(α) ≥ 0 for all α ≥ 0 , is equivalent to ρ(φ(α)) = φ∗ (ρ)(α) ≥ 0 for all
states ρ and all α ≥ 0, which in turns means φ∗ (ρ) ≥ 0 for all states ρ, or simply
for all positive functionals ρ ≥ 0. This means that positivity of φ is equivalent to
the positivity of φ∗ in terms of the dual order structure. The last defining property
of φ is the property φ(1) = 1. Let us see what this means in terms of the dual.
This condition is equivalent to ρ(φ(1)) = φ∗ (ρ)(1) = ρ(1) for all functionals ρ. This
simply means that φ∗ preserves our notion of trace: Tr(φ∗ (ρ)) = Tr(ρ) for all ρ.
Therefore the action of a morphism on states takes the form of a trace-preserving
positive linear map.


2.2.4     Effect algebra of a C∗ -algebra
Both quantum and classical sets of propositions have a number of properties in
common beyond the fact that they are effect algebras. First, as suggested above,
their effect algebras are both defined from a vector space, i.e. are linear effect
algebras. Again this means that we are given a vector space V , a partial order <
and a special element e > 0, and that the effect algebra is defined by E = {α ∈
V | 0 ≤ α ≤ e}. The additional structure that we will fix can be seen as a way of
specifying the partial order relation on our vector space.
   We will assume that V is a complex vector space, and also has a product between
elements which make it into an algebra, an involution α 7→ α∗ which makes it into
a ∗-algebra, and a norm which satisfies the axioms of a C∗ -algebra, namely
                      kα βk ≤ kαkkβk and kα∗ αk = kαk2 .
30                                                                    Quantum theory


In addition we assume that e is the algebraic unit of V . Since it is an algebra, let
us call our vector space A rather than V . Also we will write 1 instead of e.
   Let us now explain how the partial order is derived from the C∗ -algebraic struc-
ture. We can define the spectrum σ(α) of an element α ∈ A by

                         σ(α) = {λ | 1 − λα has an inverse}

We then say that α > 0 if α∗ = α and σ(α) ⊆ [0, ∞). This defines a partial order
between vectors through

                             α<β      when β − α > 0.

This is the partial order which defines the effect algebra associated with our C∗ -
algebra A.
   The main theorem of the theory of C∗ -algebra states that all C∗ -algebras can
be represented as ∗-subalgebras of the set B(H) of bounded operators acting on a
Hilbert space H. This is what makes it an appropriate axiomatization for quantum
mechanics.
   There is an important physical concept naturally encoded in the structure of
concrete C∗ -algebras which is not present in the pure effect algebra formalism,
namely the notion of independent subsystems. Given two C∗ -algebras represented
as operators on a Hilbert space: A ⊆ B(H) and A0 ⊆ B(H0 ), one has the tensor
product A ⊗ A0 ⊆ B(H ⊗ H0 ) which describes the physical system composed of A
and A0 . It is the algebra spanned by all pairs of the form α ⊗ α0 where α ∈ A and
α0 ∈ A0 , with the product defined pairwise: (α ⊗ α0 )(β ⊗ β 0 ) = (αβ) ⊗ (α0 β 0 ). The
algebra A exists within A ⊗ A0 in the form of the operators α ⊗ 1 where α ∈ A.
Reciprocally, the elements α0 ∈ A0 are represented in A ⊗ A0 through the operators
1 ⊗ α0 .


2.3      Infinite-dimensional quantum theory
Let us present a possible way of extending the quantum formalism presented in
Section 2.1 to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The formalism that we will
present is standard, in its most general form, in algebraic quantum field theory,
but it also reduces easily to a convenient formalism for non-relativistic quantum
mechanics.
    A lot of subtleties associated with infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics can
be understood as coming from the fact that an infinite-dimensional vector space
is not isomorphic to its double-dual. This means that we have to be careful in
choosing whether we want the states to be functionals on effects, or the effects to
be functionals on states.
    In the following chapters, we will make essential use of sharp effects, i.e. projec-
tors. This implies that we should work not with general C∗ -algebras, but instead
Infinite-dimensional quantum theory                                                31


with their closure in the weak topology, which are von Neumann algebras. Indeed,
von Neumann algebras are spanned by their projectors, which implies that many of
their properties can be deduced from the properties of the projectors themselves.
    The Von Neumann algebras which represent typical classical systems are how-
ever rather large. This implies that if we were to assume that states are linear
functionals on the effects, which span the algebra, there would be an awful lot of
them. We will see that it is in fact more convenient to assume that the effects are
functionals on states, i.e. that the von Neumann algebra is the dual of the span
of the set of states. This is where another advantage of von Neumann algebras
appears: they are always the dual of something, namely a Banach algebra (i.e. a
C∗ -algebra without the axiom which states that kα∗ αk = kαk2 ). If A is a von
Neumann algebra, we will write A∗ for its pre-dual, i.e. the Banach algebra which
is such that (A∗ )∗ = A.
    For instance, non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be formalized in a satis-
factory way by using for A the set of bounded operators on a separable Hilbert
space H, which we write as A = B(H). Its pre-dual can be identified with the
Banach algebra of trace-class operators A∗ = Bt (H). The trace-class operators are
the elements A ∈ B(H) for which the expression
                                    X √
                                       hi| A∗ A|ii
                                    i

converges for any basis |ii. For self-adjoint elements ρ ∈ Bt (H), this defines the
trace                                    X
                               Tr(ρ) :=      hi|ρ|ii.
                                            i

In fact, the product of an element of ρ ∈ Bt (H) with any operator A ∈ B(H) is
also trace-class, which implies that we can define Tr(ρA). This is how Bt (H) is
identified with (B(H))∗ . Indeed, ρ ∈ Bt (H) defines the functional
                                    A 7→ Tr(ρA).

    A general von Neumann algebra is equipped with a weak-∗ topology, which
amounts to defining the convergence of a sequence An ∈ B(H) in terms of expec-
tation values. I.e. we say that An converges to A as n → ∞ if ρ(An ) converges to
ρ(A) for all states ρ ∈ A∗ , which makes some physical sense. In the case of B(H),
this means that the sequence converges to A if the numbers Tr(ρAn ) converge to
Tr(ρA) as n → ∞ for all states ρ ∈ Bt (H).
    This implies that the states represented by elements of Bt (H), seen as linear
functionals of effects, are continuous with respect to the weak-∗ topology. In-
deed, if the sequence {An }∞n=1 converges to A in this topology, then, by definition
Tr(ρAn ) → Tr(ρA). Hence the map A 7→ Tr(ρA) is continuous. Conversely, those
are all the weak-∗ continuous positive linear functionals. Therefore, our choice of
states corresponds to restricting the natural set of all linear functionals on effects
to only those which are weak-∗ continuous, or normal for short.
32                                                                 Quantum theory


   Note that a von Neumann algebra, when seen as a subalgebra of B(H), also has
another weak topology, which is simply called the weak topology. It corresponds
to defining the limit of operators only in terms of pure states, i.e, we say that An
converges weakly to A if hψ|An |ψi converges to hψ|A|ψi for all |ψi ∈ H. Hence
convergence in the weak-∗ topology is a stronger condition.


2.3.1    Classical, quantum and hybrid systems
A classical system will be assumed to be specified by a commutative von Neu-
mann algebra, which can always be represented as the algebra L∞ (Ω) of (almost
everywhere) bounded functions defined on a measure space Ω. This set Ω can be
interpreted as the phase-space. The fact that Ω is a measure space means that
functions on it can be integrated. The pre-dual, which contains the states, is then
identified with the algebra L1 (Ω) of absolutely integrable functions on Ω. These
are the functions µ which are such that their absolute value x 7→ |µ(x)| has a finite
integral over Ω. The state represented by the positive function µ ∈ L1 (Ω) is then
simply given, for α ∈ L∞ (Ω), by
                                    Z
                               α 7→    µ(x) α(x) dx.
                                        Ω

The normalization of the state µ is therefore given by
                                 Z
                                     µ(x) dx = 1.
                                    Ω

Hence the states are standard continuous probability distributions. We see that this
formalism only handles probability measures on Ω which are absolutely continuous
with respect to the default measure on Ω. If we need a more exotic classical state,
we may need to take a different Ω. For instance if we choose Ω = R with the
standard Lebesgue measure, we will not have any discrete probability measure (i.e.
no delta function). However, we can include them by using instead the disjoint
union Ω = R ∪ N.
    A general von Neumann algebra A has a center, denoted by Z(A), which is
the commutative subalgebra containing the elements of A which commute with all
other elements of A. In general, the center of an algebra can be understood as the
“classical” part of the algebra, since it characterizes observables which commute
with everything else, and are therefore not subject to any uncertainty relation. In
the case of a commutative algebra, this center is obviously the whole algebra.
    From this point of view, it makes sense to define a “pure” quantum system
as being defined by an algebra whose center is trivial. The center is trivial if it
contains only elements of the form z1, z ∈ C. Such an algebra is called a factor.
There exists three main types of factor. Most of the time we will assume that we
are working with B(H) which is the most general form of a factor of type I. We note
that factors of type II are rarely used in physics, and factors of type III appear in
Infinite-dimensional quantum theory                                                33


algebraic quantum field theory. Remember however that all von Neumann algebras
can be seen as subalgebras of some B(H).
    Note that this formalism, with the physical interpretation based on states and
effects, works fine even if the von Neumann algebra A is not a factor, nor commuta-
tive. In fact we will see that these systems can be decomposed into factors labelled
by a classical variable. In this sense, they represent hybrid quantum-classical infor-
mation [39].
   Let us summarize this in a definition:
Definition 2.1. A physical model characterized by a von Neumann algebra A
will be called classical if A is commutative, quantum if A is a factor and hybrid
otherwise.

    Since all commutative von Neumann algebras are of the form L∞ (Ω), we will
always explicitly use this representation for classical systems. Also note that we
will in general only be working with factors of type I which are of the form B(H).
In addition, we will often assume that H is separable.
   A special case to point out is the von Neumann algebra C which is both com-
mutative and a factor. It has only one state, and therefore represents a system with
no degree of freedom. It is such that C ⊗ A = A ⊗ C = A for any von Neumann
algebra A. Indeed, z ⊗ A = 1 ⊗ zA for any z ∈ C, which means that C ⊗ A can be
identified with A through the map z ⊗ A 7→ zA and its inverse A 7→ 1 ⊗ A. The
same argument works for A ⊗ C.
   Let us list a few facts about von Neumann algebras that we will use

   • The commutant of any “self-adjoint” set of operators (i.e. closed under the
     dual operation) is a von Neumann algebra [40].

   • A von Neumann algebra is the norm-closure of the span of its projectors [40].
     This also implies that it is the weak-∗ closure of the span of its projectors.

   • A commutative von Neumann algebra is always of the form L∞ (Ω) for some
     measure space Ω [41].

   • A factors of type I is isomorphic to B(H) for some Hilbert space H [41].

   • If H is separable, then Bt (H) is separable [42].


2.3.2     Channels
A communication channel from a system represented by the algebra AA to a system
represented by AB can be defined, as in the finite-dimensional case, by a unital
completely positive linear map

                                   E ∗ : AB → AA
34                                                                  Quantum theory


on effects. However, since we asked for the states to be weak-∗ continuous functions,
we also need the channels to be weak-∗-weak-∗ continuous, which we will summarize
by saying that they are normal. This implies that E ∗ is always the dual of a linear
map
                                 E : (AA )∗ → (AB )∗
which is meant to act on states. As in the finite-dimensional case, it is the map on
state E that we will call a channel, while E ∗ will only be called its dual.
   If AA = B(HA ) and AB = B(HB ) for some separable Hilbert spaces HA and
HB , then these maps can be represented as
                                            ∞
                                            X
                                   ∗
                                  E (A) =         Ek∗ AEk
                                            k=1

and                                         ∞
                                            X
                                  E(ρ) =          Ek ρEk∗
                                            k=1
where the sum can now be infinite [33]. We will call this the Choi-Kraus form of
the channel E. The elements Ek are bounded linear operators from HA to HB . This
can be understood starting from the Stinespring dilation theorem for completely
positive maps between C∗ -algebras, which states that there is a representation π of
AB on some Hilbert space H, and an isometry V : HB → H, such that
                                  E ∗ (A) = V ∗ π(A)V
for all A ∈ AB . Since AB = B(HB ), and E ∗ is normal, the representation π on H is
of the form π(A) = A ⊗ 1. Also, if HB is separable, then so is H [43]. Therefore the
subsystem on which π(A) acts trivially is also separable, and possesses a discrete
basis |ii. This implies that
                                             X
                    E ∗ (A) = V ∗ (A ⊗ 1)V =    V ∗ (A ⊗ |iihi|)V
                                                   i
                              X
                          =       (V ∗ ⊗ |ii)A(V ⊗ hi|).
                              i

Therefore the elements of the channel E can be chosen to be Ei = V ⊗hi|. Note that
this makes it clear that there is a large ambiguity in the choice of the elements Ei .
Indeed, any orthonormal basis |ii would potentially yield a different set of elements.
    This definition applies for arbitrary von Neumann algebras AA and AB . In
particular, if both are commutative, this simply defines a stochastic map between
classical probability distributions.


2.3.3     Observables
Given that a classical system is also modeled by a von Neumann algebra, we will
simply define an observable to be a channel (in the above sense) from a classical
system to a quantum system, i.e.

sends a function on R, which represents a proposition about the position, to a function
on R2 representing a proposition about the full phase-space. The interval on R here
represents the characteristic function for this interval, which is a sharp effect. It is
mapped to the characteristic function for an infinite stripe in phase-space.


Definition 2.2. An observable X on the system specified by the algebra A and
which takes values in the measure space Ω, is specified by a unital positive normal
map X ∗ : L∞ (Ω) → A, or equivalently by a trace-preserving positive linear map

                                     X : A∗ → L1 (Ω).

of which X ∗ is the dual .

    In this case the complete positivity comes for free as in the finite-dimensional
case [43]. Note that in general, A∗ is not equipped with a trace like the one defined
for Bt (H). Hence the trace which is preserved in the general case is Tr(ρ) := ρ(1).
    This definition also holds when A is commutative, where it defines a classical
observable. Note that a classical observable is identical to a classical channel, i.e.
a stochastic map. For instance, consider the case where A = L∞ (R2 ), which could
describe a single classical particle with phase-space R2 parameterized by position-
momentum pairs (q, p) ∈ R2 . The position observable is then represented by the
map
                               Q∗ : L∞ (R) → L∞ (R2 )
which sends a function α on R to the function β = Q(α) defined by β(q, p) := α(q).
Hence it says how a question about position can be translated into a question about
phase-space (see Figure 2.1).
   This notion of an observable corresponds only to a subset of the positive operator
valued measures. In order to obtain a POVM E from the observable X, it suffices
36                                                                 Quantum theory


to apply X ∗ to the characteristic functions χ(ω) of each subsets ω ⊆ Ω. Hence the
POVM E corresponding to X is given by

                                  E(ω) = X ∗ (χω )

for any ω ⊆ Ω. This is indeed a POVM since
                 [              X         X              X
               E( ωk ) = X ∗ (    χωk ) =   X ∗ (χωk ) =   (ωk )
                    k             k          k              k

for any disjoint sequence of subsets ωk ⊆ Ω, and also

                                E(Ω) = X ∗ (1) = 1.

In order to see that this does not yield every POVMs, consider the case where A
is one-dimensional, which is to say A = C. Then a POVM E on Ω with values
in A = C is any positive measure on Ω. Now suppose that X is an observable on
A = C as defined above. Then it is a linear   map from C to L1 (Ω), which is just
an element α ∈ L1 (Ω) such that X ∗ (χω ) = ω α(x) dx. Hence X can only represent
                                           R

measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to the measure associated
with Ω, contrary to a POVM which could represent any positive measure. This
means in particular that, if we were to take Ω = R then we could not represent
any discrete POVM. However this can be overcome simply by choosing instead the
disjoint union Ω = R ∪ N.
   Note that we could have modeled all POVMs if we did not require that the
channel representing the observable be weak-∗ continuous. Indeed, a POVM can
be seen as a unital positive linear map

                                  E : C0 (Ω) → A

where C0 (Ω) is the C∗ -algebra of continuous functions on Ω with compact support
[43].
    The fact that our notion of observables is more restrictive than the usual def-
inition in terms of POVM is desired, because it makes the set of all observables
easier to handle. In particular, if A is finite-dimensional, then the set of all the
observables with value in a fixed set Ω is separable.


2.3.4    Sharp observables

As in the finite-dimensional case, an observable X will be called sharp if it maps
all the sharp classical propositions χω , ω ⊆ Ω to sharp quantum propositions
(X ∗ (χω ))2 = X ∗ (χω ). This implies that the corresponding POVM is in fact a
projection valued measure (PVM). A PVM is also known as an orthogonal parti-
tion of the unity. It can always be seen as representing the spectral measure of a
Infinite-dimensional quantum theory                                               37


self-adjoint operator A. If Ω = R, and we define the PVM Π(ω) := X ∗ (χω ), we
have                                Z
                                A=      x Π(dx)
                                       x∈R

This notation can be understood intuitively as meaning that we define the integral
as the limit of discrete sums with intervals ∆x. Π(dx) can then be conceived
intuitively as the limit of the operators Π(∆x).
   If the sharp observable takes value in a set Ω 6= R, representing it as the
spectral measure of a self-adjoint operator A would require a measure-preserving
map f : Ω → R. We could then write
                                    Z
                               A :=      f (x)Π(dx).
                                      x∈Ω

This is due to the fact that an observable represented by a self-adjoint operator
takes values in its spectrum, which must belong to R. It suffices to think about the
case Ω = R2 to realize that the map f can be pretty messy. This shows that the
formalism of PVMs can be more convenient than that of self-adjoint operators in
that it easily allows to talk about observables with non-scalar values.
    Conversely, if we are given the self-adjoint operator A, then the corresponding
PVM is given by the L∞ (Ω) functional calculus of A, where Ω is the spectrum of
A. This means that for any classical proposition α ∈ L∞ (Ω), we obtain the effect
X ∗ (α) through the relation
                                   X ∗ (α) = α(A).

   The map X ∗ is a von Neumann algebra isomorphism. In particular it satisfies

                 X ∗ (αβ) = (αβ)(A) = α(A)β(A) = X ∗ (α)X ∗ (β).

The image of X ∗ is a commutative subalgebra of the von Neumann algebra on
which it is defined, namely the von-Neumann algebra generated by A, which is a
faithful representation of the algebra L∞ (Ω).


2.3.5    A category
One advantage of the formalism chosen is that classical systems and quantum sys-
tems are both modeled in the same way, as von Neumann algebras, and all the maps
of interest are normal completely-positive unital maps between these algebras. In
the dual picture, we are working with the pre-duals of von Neumann algebras and
the trace-preserving completely positive maps between them. We will generally
make use of the maps between pre-duals since they directly say how states evolve.
Intuitively, the right direction of the flow of information is from states to states.
Indeed, states represent the information that we, the observers, possess about the
systems, and it is our information which flows from one to the other.
38                                                                         Quantum theory


   Hence most of our discourse will take place in the category whose objects are
the pre-duals of von Neumann algebras, and whose morphisms are trace-preserving
completely positive maps between them [44]. For instance, an observable X of a
quantum system represented by the Hilbert space H is a morphism
                                                X-
                                     Bt (H)            L1 (Ω)

where L1 (Ω) contains the states of the classical pointer which represents the value
of the observable. Of course, quantum channels are also morphisms:
                                                E-
                                 Bt (HA )              Bt (HB )

States themselves can be represented by the morphisms
                                               ρ-
                                      C              Bt (H)

Indeed, all that this map ρ can do is send each complex number z to z times a fixed
element, say ρ̂, of Bt (H): z 7→ z ρ̂. Since ρ is positive, ρ̂ must be a positive operator.
In addition, the fact that ρ is trace-preserving implies Tr(z ρ̂) = zTr(ρ̂) = Tr(z) = z,
i.e. Tr(ρ̂) = 1.
  As an exercise, note that the trace is the only morphism from Bt (H) to C. It
amounts to erasing all information.
                                                Tr -
                                      Bt (H)         C

Effects can be represented as observables with pointer Ω = {0, 1}, i.e. with target
L1 ({0, 1}) = L({0, 1}) ≈ C2 :
                                               A
                                 Bt (H)        -   L1 ({0, 1})

    At this point we may wonder about the possible meaning of a morphism φ :
 1
L (Ω) → Bt (H), i.e. a flow of information from a classical system to a quantum
system. Since it is linear it must be defined by its action on a basis of L1 (Ω).
Consider for instance the case where Ω is finite. Then a basis is given by the pure
states χi (j) = δij for all i, j ∈ Ω. Since these functions are states, the images are
quantum states ρi := φ(χi ) which are completely arbitrary. Hence φ is a state-
preparation device. It encodes classical information into a quantum system by
directly mapping the pure classical states into arbitrary quantum states:
                                                φ-
                                     L1 (Ω)            Bt (H)

   The composition of a state preparation and an observation yields a channel
between two classical systems:

2.4      Summary
In this chapter, we have seen that we can model quantum and classical systems in
terms of their set of effects, or equivalently in terms of the dual set of states. Effects
represent elementary propositions and states assign a probability to each effects.
In both the quantum and classical cases, the effects can be seen as elements of a
C∗ -algebra. The essential aspect of these algebras, for our purpose, is the fact that
they are ordered vector spaces, i.e. vector spaces with a suitably compatible partial
order. The effects are those vectors which are larger than zero and smaller than 1.
For our purposes, it is convenient to assume that the C∗ -algebras have a pre-dual,
which means that they are von-Neumann algebras. We then restrict states to those
functionals which live in the pre-dual. Table 2.1 summarizes some of our notations.
    A transfer of information, or channel, from system A to system B is represented
by a map from the states of A to the states of B, whose dual is a unital completely-
positive map from effects of B to effects of A. For clarity, it is always the map on
states which will be referred to as the channel, since it goes in the direction which
we intuitively associate with the direction of the flow of information.
    A quantum observable, or observable for short, is a channel from a quantum
to a classical system. The classical system can be interpreted as that part of a
measurement apparatus which displays the result of the measurement. This notion
of an observable is essentially equivalent to that of a POVM, although slightly more
restrictive.
Chapter 3

Preserved information

Recall that our aim is to characterize decoherence through the type of information
flowing between a system and its environment, or within the system. Therefore, we
need a way to formally talk in detail about the nature of the information preserved
by a quantum channel. In this chapter, we introduce the main new concept that we
will be using, and derive a number of basic results about it. Although our results
are based on many known results, mostly in the theory of quantum error correction,
we will present them in a logical, rather than a historical order. Hence we will not
mention the known results here, but instead show how to derive them from our
more general point of view in the next chapter.
   The main definition that we will be playing with is the following:
Definition 3.1. An observable X is said to be preserved by a channel E if there
exists an observable Y such that X = Y ◦ E. We write PE for the set of observables
preserved by E.

   Recall that the equation X = Y ◦ E means that X is the image of Y in the
Heisenberg picture (see Section 2.1.5). For a discrete observable with elements Xi
and Yi , this means that Xi = E ∗ (Yi ) for all i. If Ω is the set of values of X, we
have:
                                         E    - A2
                                 A1

                                                  Y
                                        X
                                              -
                                                  ?
                                              L1 (Ω)
Hence, for any state of system A, measuring Y on system B yields the same result
(i.e. the same probability distribution on Ω) as measuring X on the initial system
A. This justifies the idea that the information about A represented by X has been
preserved by the channel E: we can perfectly simulate an observation of X on the
initial state by observing Y after the action of the channel.

   If the observable X is sharp, we know that it can also be represented by a self-
adjoint operator X. b As an example, suppose that this observable has a discrete
spectrum. This implies that it is of the form X b = P xi Pi where xi is the eigenvalue
                                                        i
corresponding to the spectral projection Pi . In this case, X is preserved     if Pi =
 ∗
                                                                        P
E (Yi ) for all i, where the effects Yi form a discrete observable, i.e. i Yi = 1.
                                         b = E ∗ (Yb ) for some self-adjoint operator Yb .
    It is not sufficient to require that X
Indeed, this equation only means that the first moment of X       b is preserved for any
state ρ: Tr(ρX) = Tr(E(ρ)Y ). On the other hand, if we require that Pi = E ∗ (Yi ) for
               b              b
all i, then all the moments of X are preserved. Indeed, for any n, X      b n = P xni Pi ,
                                                                                  i
from which it is easy to see that also

                                    b n ) = Tr(E(ρ)Yb n )
                                Tr(ρX

for any n.
   Note that we can also define the moments of any scalar (and possible unsharp)
observable X defined by               Z
                                X ∗ (α) =       α(x) Xx dx
                                            R

where Xx are operators, and α a real function. The nth moment of X can be
represented by the operator
                                   Z
                             cn :=
                             X         xn Xx dx.
                                            R

Indeed, we have
                                Z                      Z
                                      n
                       cn ) =
                   Tr(ρX             x Tr(ρXx ) dx =       xn X(ρ)(x)dx
                                 R                     R


This equation means that the expectation value of X  cn on ρ yields the nth moment
of the probability distribution X(ρ). If X is preserved, then so are its moments, in
the sense that Xcn = E ∗ (Ycn ) for all n.

    Consider the case of yes-no observables, i.e. observables with two outcomes,
which are one-to-one with effects. If X0 and X1 are the two elements characterizing
a yes-no observable, we must have X0 + X1 = 1, which implies X1 = 1 − X0 . This
observable is preserved by the channel E when there exists another yes-no observable
Y such that X0 = E ∗ (Y0 ) and X1 = E ∗ (Y1 ). However the second equation is redun-
dant. Indeed, this first equation implies E ∗ (Y1 ) = E ∗ (1 − Y0 ) = E ∗ (1) − E ∗ (Y0 ) =
1−X0 = X1 . Therefore, the preserved yes-no observables are characterized by what
we define as the preserved effects, namely the effects which are image of another
effect under E ∗ .
Definition 3.2. An effect A ∈ E(A1 ) is preserved by E : A1 → A2 if there exists
B ∈ E(A2 ) such that A = E ∗ (B). Hence, the set of preserved effects is E ∗ (E(A2 )).
A set of observables?                                                                   43


   A general preserved observable X satisfies X ∗ = E ∗ ◦ Y ∗ , which means that for
any classical proposition α, X ∗ (α) = E ∗ (Y ∗ (α)). Hence all the effects X ∗ (α) associ-
ated with the observable X are individually preserved by the map E. For a discrete
observable X, this means that any sum of its elements belongs to E ∗ (E(A2 )).



3.1      A set of observables?

We introduced a notion of preserved observable, and therefore also a notion of
preserved effect. Since preserved observables are made of preserved effects, we may
wonder if we could limit the discussion to the set of preserved effects, which are
simpler objects. In addition, the set of preserved effects is an effect algebra, which
can be understood as defining an effective physical system of its own, as discussed
in Section 2.2.
    However, the set of preserved effects, although it certainly gives interesting
information about the channel, does not always contain as much information as
the set of preserved observables. Indeed, it is not always true that a preserved
observable is characterized by preserved effects. A counter example is given in
Section 3.1.1 below.
   However it is true in the “generic case”, when the channel has no kernel:

Proposition 3.1. If the channel E : A1 → A2 is invertible, then the two following
statements are equivalent

  1. The observable X is preserved by E,

  2. X ∗ (α) ∈ E ∗ (E(A2 )) for all α.


Proof. We have already shown above that Statement 1 implies Statement 2. Con-
versely, suppose that X ∗ (α) ∈ E ∗ (E(A2 )) for all α. Let φ := (E ∗ )−1 ◦ X ∗ . We have
to show that the linear map φ is positive and unital. Since E ∗ is invertible, its range
is the whole positive cone of A2 and its inverse maps the positive cone of A2 to
that of A1 , which means that it is also positive. Given that X ∗ itself is positive, φ
is positive. In addition we have that (E ∗ )−1 (1) = 1, which implies φ(1) = 1.


3.1.1     A counter-example

Let us now give an example of a channel, together with an observable which is not
preserved but which is made of preserved effects. We consider a channel of the form

                                 E : M(C3 ) → M(C4 ).
44                                                                  Preserved information


Let |ii, i = 1, . . . , 4 denotes a basis of C4 . For convenience, we will use its first three
elements |ii for i = 1, . . . , 3 to define a basis of C3 too. Also, we write Pi := |iihi|.
We define E by

It is easy to see that this map is completely positive. Indeed the P
                                                                   first term already
has the Choi-Kraus form, and the second term can be written as 3 3i=1 |4ihi|ρ|iih4|.

Also it is trace-preserving. Indeed,

                                    1X             2
                         Tr(E(ρ)) =       hi|ρ|ii + Tr(ρ)

The dual is

Now consider the discrete observable X on C3 with elements
                                        1            1
                                    X1 = (P2 + P3 ) + 1
                                        3            3
                                        1
                                    X2 = (P1 + P3 )
                                        3
                                        1
                                    X3 = (P1 + P2 )
                                        3
These elements are clearly positive and sum to the identity:
                             X             2X      1
                                    Xi =       Pi + 1 3 = 1 3 .
                               i
                                           3 i     3

In addition, any sums of the elements Xi are inside E ∗ (E(C4 )). To see this it is
useful to note that E ∗ , viewed as a linear map, has a kernel which is generated by

                                                     1
                                   K = P1 + P2 + P3 − P4 .
                                                     2
Since E ∗ (K) = 0, we can subtract any multiple of K in the argument of E ∗ in order
to make sure that the argument is an effect. If we define the effects

                                                     1
                                     Y10 := P2 + P3 + P4
                                                     2
                                     Y20 := P1 + P3
                                     Y30 := P1 + P2
A set of observables?                                                              45


then we have Xi = E ∗ (Yi0 ) and also

                   X1 + X2 = E ∗ (Y10 + Y20 − K) = E ∗ (P2 + P4 )
                                                             1
                   X2 + X3 = E ∗ (Y20 + Y30 − K) = E ∗ (P1 + P4 )
                                                             2
                   X1 + X3 = E ∗ (Y10 + Y30 − K) = E ∗ (P2 + P4 )



This suffices to show that X ∗ (α) ∈ E ∗ (E(C4 )) for any α. However, the observable
X as a whole is not preserved by the channel E. In order for it to be preserved,
we would need to find another observable Y with elements Yi , i = 1, . . . , 3 such
that Xi = E ∗ (Yi ) for all i. We note that the effects Yi0 cannot serve this purpose
because
P 0 they do not form an 1observable. Indeed          they fail to sum to the identity:
                                              1
   i Yi = 2P1 + 2P2 + 2P3 + 2 P4 = 214 − 2 P4 . If we wish to modify these three
operators while maintaining their images under E ∗ , the only thing we can do is add
or subtract different multiples of K to each of them. However it is easy to see that
this cannot be done without getting them out of the set of effects E(C4 ). Indeed,
note that they are all diagonal operators, hence the diagonal coefficient are the
eigenvalues. It is easy to see that adding or subtracting any amount of K to any
of them would set some diagonal elements either smaller that 0 or larger than 1,
which would mean that they are not effects anymore.

   Note that this example is entirely classical since all the operators involved are
codiagonal. Therefore the counter example also applies to classical channels.



3.1.2     Preserved effective theory

As mentioned above, the set of effects preserved by a channel is an effect algebra. It
can be understood as defining an effective physical system, namely a “subsystem”—
in a very general sense—of the initial quantum system. When the channel is in-
vertible, this subsystem has a true operational existence as it effectively models
the experimentally accessible degrees of freedom of the system filtered through the
noise represented by the channel.

    However, the above counter-example shows that for more general channels, some
of the observables represented by this set of effects cannot in fact be measured (are
not themselves preserved). This implies that, in principle, we should use a more
general framework than that of an effect algebra, and define a physical theory
directly by a set of general observables.

   This explains why, in the rest of this thesis, we will always take the set of
preserved observable as the fundamental object of study, and reduce it to effects
only when possible.

3.2      Sharp preserved observables
In this section we will consider a quantum channel E : Bt (H1 ) → Bt (H2 ). We will
also assume that H1 is separable. We saw in Section 2.3.2 that such a channel can
always be represented in terms of a countable family of channel elements Ek , as
                                          X
                                E ∗ (B) =   Ek∗ BEk
                                             k

where the sum converges in the weak-∗ topology. Note that from now on, all sums
of operators will be assumed to be at most countably infinite, and convergent in
the weak-∗ topology.
     Let us consider the sharp preserved effects, i.e. those which belong to E ∗ (E(H2 )).
A sharp effect P ∈ E(H1 ) is a an effect which is also a projection, i.e. P 2 = P . If
it is preserved, then there is an effect B ∈ E(H2 ) such that

                                      P = E ∗ (B).                                  (3.1)

In order to characterize the sharp preserved effects, we want to obtain an equivalent
condition which involves only the channel elements Ek .
   First, let us state a simple technical lemma that we will use several times:
                   P ∗
Lemma 3.2. If        k Fk BFk = 0 for some positive operator B and a family of
operators Fk , then BFk = 0 for all k.

Proof. For any vector |ψi, we have
        X                 X      √ ∗√         X √
         hψ|Fk∗ BFk |ψi =  hψ|Fk∗ B BFk |ψi =  k BFk |ψik2 = 0.
         k                     k                           k

                                      √
This
√    implies that each positive term k  BFk |ψik2 in
                                                  √ the sum is zero. Therefore
 BFk |ψi = 0 for any vector |ψi, which means that BFk = 0.
    We could apply this lemma to Equation 3.1 if we had a zero on the left-hand
side of the equation. This is the case if we multiply this term by P ⊥ = 1 − P .
Indeed P ⊥ P = (1 − P )P = P − P 2 = P − P = 0. But we want the right-hand side
term to be positive for the trick to work, therefore we multiply by P ⊥ from both
sides:
                           P ⊥ E ∗ (B)P ⊥ = P ⊥ P P ⊥ = 0
Applying Lemma 3.2 we get BEk (1 − P ) = 0 for all k, i.e.

                                     BEk = BEk P.                                   (3.2)

There is another similar equation that we can use. For every preserved effect P we
get another preserved effect for free, namely its orthocomplement: 1 − P . Indeed,
Sharp preserved observables                                                        47


E ∗ (1 − B) = 1 − E ∗ (B) = 1 − P , and 1 − B is a valid effect. Using the same
argument as above, we obtain (1 − B)Ek P = 0, i.e.

                                    Ek P = BEk P.                                (3.3)

Combining Equations 3.2 and 3.3, we get

                                     BEk = Ek P.                                 (3.4)

This means than the existence of an effect B which is such that BEk = Ek P for all
channel elements Ek is a necessary condition for P to be preserved by the channel.
In fact, it is easy to see that this condition is sufficient. Indeed, if BEk = Ek P ,
then                        X            X
                  E ∗ (B) =    Ek∗ BEk =     Ek∗ Ek P = E ∗ (1)P = P.
                            k               k

    We achieved obtaining a condition which depends on each channel elements
Ek independently, rather than on the whole channel. However, if we really want
a useful characterization of the sharp preserved effects, we need to eliminate any
reference to the unknown operator B. First note that by taking the adjoint of
Equation 3.4 we obtain Ek∗ B = P Ek∗ . Together with Equation 3.4, this implies

                            Ek∗ Ej P = Ek∗ BEj = P Ek∗ Ej .

This is a necessary condition for P to be preserved, which does not involve the
unknown effect B. In fact, this condition is sufficient.
Theorem 3.3. A sharp effect P is preserved by the channel E(ρ) = k Ek ρEk∗ if
                                                                  P
and only if
                             [P, Ei∗ Ej ] = 0 for all i,j.                (3.5)

Proof. We have already proven the necessity. In order to prove the sufficiency, we
will use this condition to build the effect B of which P is the image. We will need
the completely positive map Eλ defined by
                                            ∞
                                            X
                                Eλ (A) :=         λi Ei AEi∗                     (3.6)
                                            i=0

where λi := 2−i . This choice of λ guarantees that the sum converges in norm for any
effect A since kEi AEi∗ k ≤ 1. In fact, any choice of components λi > 0 which makes
this sum weak-∗ convergent for any effect A would be sufficient for our purpose.
Note that if λi = 1 for all i, then Eλ = E, which is defined only on trace-class
operators.
   We will try the ansatz
                                B := (Eλ (1))−1 Eλ (P ).                         (3.7)
First, we have to show that Eλ (1) can indeed be inverted. Note that Eλ (1)|ψi = 0
if and only if hψ|Eλ (1)|ψi = 0 since it is positive. If we write the channel in terms
48                                                                                  Preserved information


of the elements Ek , we obtain a sum of positive terms which must all be equal to
zero: hψ|Ei Ei∗ |ψi = 0. Hence Ei∗ |ψi = 0 for all i. This means that if |ψi is in the
kernel of Eλ (1), it must be in the kernel of each Ei∗ , and therefore be orthogonal to
the range of each Ei . This shows that we can invert Eλ (1) on the range of any of
the operators Ei . In the following we will always be able to assume that (Eλ (1))−1
operates on the span of the ranges of the operators Ei . In particular, Equation 3.7
is well-defined.
     Now that we have defined B, let us check that E ∗ (B) = P . We have

                          BEi = (Eλ (1))−1 Eλ (P )Ei
                                           X
                              = (Eλ (1))−1      λk Ek P Ek∗ Ei
                                                         k
                                                     X
                                  = (Eλ (1))    −1
                                                                 λk Ek Ek∗ Ei P
                                                         k
                                                −1
                                  = (Eλ (1)) Eλ (1)Ei P = Ei P

which is Equation 3.4 and proves that E ∗ (B) = PP. However we have   P to check    that
                                                                  ∗               ∗
B is an effect. Note that BEi = Ei P implies i λi BEi Ei = i λi Ei P Ei , i.e.,
BEλ (1) = Eλ (P ), which implies B = Eλ (P )(Eλ (1))−1 . From the definition of B, we
also have B = (Eλ (1))−1 Eλ (P ). Hence [(Eλ (1))−1 , Eλ (P )] = 0, which implies that
                                            1                           1
                              B = Eλ (1)− 2 Eλ (P )Eλ (1)− 2 ≥ 0                                    (3.8)
                          1            1
In addition, B ≤ Eλ (1)− 2 1Eλ (1)− 2 = 1, which shows that it is an effect.
   The dependence of B on P in the above proof is in fact given by the dual of a
completely positive trace-preserving map, i.e. a channel. Explicitly, this channel is
                                                             1              1
                               R(ρ) = Eλ∗ (Eλ (1)− 2 ρ Eλ (1)− 2 )                                  (3.9)

and its dual
                                                     1                          1
                              R∗ (A) = Eλ (1)− 2 Eλ (A)Eλ (1)− 2 .
 We will see in Chapter 4 that this channel R is the “correction” channel of the
theory of quantum error correction. This particular way of writing it appeared
before in [45] for the case λi = 1 which works when H1 is finite-dimensional.
    Theorem 3.3 yields also some unsharp preserved effects. Indeed, given the lin-
earity of E ∗ , if two effects are preserved, then so is any of their convex combinations
(which are also effects). Therefore, the convex hull of the preserved projectors is
entirely preserved. In fact, the continuity of this channel implies that the weak-∗
closure of this convex hull is also preserved.
    Consider the commutant AE of the operators Ei∗ Ej , i.e. the set of operators
which commute with them. This set is clearly an algebra. In fact, it is a von
Neumann algebra, which always has the property that the set of effects it contains
is the closed convex full of its projectors [46]. Since all the projectors in AE are
preserved, then so are all the effects it contains. This proves the following:
Sharp preserved observables                                                            49


Corollary 3.4. The set of effects spanning the von Neumann algebra
                    AE = {A ∈ B(H1 ) | [A, Ei∗ Ej ] = 0 for all i,j}
are all preserved by E. In addition, this algebra contains all the preserved sharp
effects.

   We can now easily generalize Theorem 3.3 to all sharp observables.
Theorem 3.5. A sharp observable X is preserved by the channel E if and only if
                                X ∗ (α) ∈ AE    for all α                          (3.10)

Proof. The necessity of this condition follows from the fact that if X is preserved,
then there is an observable Y such that X ∗ (α) = E ∗ (Y ∗ (α)) for all α, which implies
in particular that all the sharp effects X ∗ (χω ) for ω ⊆ Ω are preserved by E, and
therefore belong to AE . Since the unsharp effects X ∗ (α) all belong to the von
Neumann algebra generated by the sharp effects X ∗ (χω ), we also have X ∗ (α) ∈
AE for all α. Conversely, consider the channel Y := X ◦ R, which is clearly an
observable. If X ∗ (χω ) ∈ AE for all ω, then we know that X ∗ (χω ) = E ∗ (Y ∗ (χω )) for
all ω. By linearity and continuity of E ∗ , X ∗ (α) = E ∗ (Y ∗ (α)) for all α.
    This theorem yields a direct interpretation of the whole algebra AE if we rep-
resent the sharp observables by self-adjoint operators in the traditional manner.
Indeed, remember that we can represent a sharp observable X by the (possibly
unbounded) self-adjoint operator X b whose spectral projection-valued measure is
       ∗
ω 7→ X (χω ). They are related through the equation

                                    X ∗ (α) = α(X)
                                                b

which involves the functional calculus on b
                                          X.
Corollary 3.6. A sharp observable represented by the bounded self-adjoint operator
b is preserved by the channel E if and only if
X
                                        b ∈ AE .
                                        X

Proof. If X is preserved, then AE 3 X ∗ (id) = id(X)
                                                  b = X.               b ∈ AE ,
                                                      b Conversely, if X
then X ∗ (α) = α(X)
                  b ∈ AE for all α.
    We have not yet discussed the properties of the operators B obtained by Equa-
tion 3.8. In fact they are projectors. Indeed, remember that B = Eλ (1)−1 Eλ (P ) =
Eλ (P )Eλ (1)−1 . Therefore
                          B 2 = Eλ (1)−1 Eλ (P )Eλ (P )Eλ (1)−1
                              = Eλ (1)−1 Eλ (1)Eλ (P 2 )Eλ (1)−1
                              = Eλ (P 2 )Eλ (1)−1
                              = Eλ (P )Eλ (1)−1 = B.
This can be used to show that
50                                                               Preserved information


Proposition 3.7. A preserved sharp observable is always the image of a sharp
observable.

Proof. Remember that if the sharp observable X is preserved, then it is the image
                                                                1                   1
of the observable Y given by Y ∗ (α) = R∗ (X ∗ (α)) = Eλ (1)− 2 Eλ (X ∗ (α))Eλ (1)− 2 .
From the above observation, we know that since X ∗ (χω ) is a projector for any
subset ω ⊆ Ω, then so is Y ∗ (χω ), which proves that Y is sharp.


3.3      Outgoing information
If the evolution in time of a quantum system is given by a channel

                                 E : Bt (H1 ) → Bt (H2 )

which is not unitary, then it means that the system is interacting with an “envi-
ronment”. The environment can be any other quantum system, the state of which
we have ignored in our description. This fact is reflected in the Stinespring dilation
theorem [43], which states that a completely positive map as above can always be
represented (via its dual) as

                                 E ∗ (A) = V ∗ (A ⊗ 1)V                         (3.11)

where V is a bounded operator

                                  V : H1 → H2 ⊗ HE

such that V ∗ V = 1, i.e. an isometry. Here HE can be interpreted as the Hilbert
space of the environment. The Choi-Kraus representation of the channel follows
from this theorem by noting that, for any orthonormal basis |ii of the environment,
                      X                       X
            E ∗ (A) =     V ∗ (A ⊗ |iihi|)V =   V ∗ (1 ⊗ |ii)A(1 ⊗ hi|)V
                       i                          i

Hence the channel elements of E are

                                    Ei = (1 ⊗ hi|)V                             (3.12)

which means that
                           X                X
                  E(ρ) =        Ei ρEi∗ =    (1 ⊗ hi|)V AV ∗ (1 ⊗ |ii)

This channel is called a partial trace, here taken over the environment HE . It
corresponds to the action of “erasing” any information about the system HE . Its
dual, which we implicitly used above, is the ampliation map

                             Tr∗E : B(H2 ) −→ B(H2 ⊗ HE )
                                       A 7−→ A ⊗ 1

It says how an effect of H2 can be also seen as an effect of H2 ⊗ HE .
   Physically, suppose that the environment starts in a known state |ψE i, and
that the two evolve according to the joint unitary operator U , i.e. ρ ⊗ |ψE ihψE |
evolves to U (ρ ⊗ |ψE ihψE |)U ∗ . Since the initial state of the environment is fixed,
and uncorrelated with ρ, we can view this simply as a map on ρ ∈ Bt (H1 ), with
target in Bt (H2 ⊗ HE ):

               ρ 7−→ U (ρ ⊗ |ψE ihψE |)U ∗ = U (1 ⊗ |ψE i)ρ(1 ⊗ hψE |)U ∗

(See figure 3.1.) This gives a physical interpretation to the isometry

                                     V := U (1 ⊗ |ψE i).

To check that this is indeed an isometry, note that V ∗ V = (1 ⊗ hψE |)U ∗ U (1 ⊗
|ψE i) = 1hψE |ψE i = 1.
  The operation which consists in taking the partial trace over the environment
means that we ignore its state for the calculation of any further expectation value,
52                                                            Preserved information


or probability. Indeed, if, after the interaction, we only plan to measure observables
of the system, which are of the form A ⊗ 1, then all expectation values take the
form
                      Tr(V ρV ∗ (A ⊗ 1)) = Tr(TrE (V ρV ∗ )A).

   This interpretation is also straightforward if we stick to the Heisenberg picture,
where the form E ∗ (A) = V ∗ (A ⊗ 1)V directly implies that we are only worrying
about observables of the form A ⊗ 1 on the final joint state of the system and
environment.
    The characterization of the preserved sharp observables, derived in the previous
section, can also naturally be expressed in terms of the isometry V rather than in
terms of the channel elements Ek . Remember that the preserved observables are
those which commute with the operators Ei∗ Ej for all i and j. Using Equation 3.12,
we have
                              Ei∗ Ej = V ∗ (1 ⊗ |iihj|)V.
Hence the span of the operators Ei∗ Ej is simply V ∗ (1 ⊗ B(HE ))V . This means that
a sharp effect P is preserved by E if and only if

                     [P, V ∗ (1 ⊗ B)V ] = 0   for all B ∈ B(HE ).              (3.13)

   In fact, the effects of the form V ∗ (1 ⊗ B)V have an important physical meaning.
Indeed, they are preserved by the channel Ec defined by its dual

                                Ec∗ (B) := V ∗ (1 ⊗ B)V.

This channel Ec is called the complementary channel to E. As E maps H1 to H2 ,
Ec maps H1 to HE . It tells what information flows from the initial states of the
system H1 to the environment HE . Indeed, the effects of the form Ec∗ (B) ∈ B(H1 )
can be simulated by measuring B on the final state of the environment.
     This gives us directly an interpretation for Equation 3.13:
Corollary 3.8. A sharp observable is preserved by E if and only if it commutes
with all the effects preserved by the complementary channel Ec . Hence, the preserved
algebra AE is given by

                   AE = {A | [A, B] = 0 for all B ∈ Ec∗ (E(HE )) }.

   In particular, this implies that the sharp observables preserved by E all commute
with the sharp observables preserved by Ec . Hence the algebra

                                   CE := AE ∩ AEc

is commutative and therefore characterizes an effective classical system with phase-
space Ω such that
                                  CE = L∞ (Ω).
Example: measurements                                                              53


     This is a detailed form of the no-broadcasting theorem, which is a stronger
version of the no-cloning theorem. Indeed, the algebra CE characterizes the sharp
observables representing information which has been preserved in the system and
at the same time transfered to the environment. Therefore this information is
accessible from two different systems. This means that it has been at best broadcast
(if there are correlations) and at worst cloned (if there are no correlations). Hence,
the fact that CE is commutative means that the sharp information which is broadcast
must always be classical.
   We will argue in Section 5.2 that this gives a way in which a classical system
can emerge within a completely quantum system. Here the classical system is
characterized by the only sharp information which is broadcast by an arbitrary
quantum interaction. A generalization of this result to unsharp observables will be
the basis of our picture of decoherence, presented in Section 5.5.


3.4        Example: measurements
Examples involving sharp observables will be given in the context of quantum error
correction in Chapter 4.1. Since most results presented in this chapter concern
only sharp observables, let us give here some examples involving unsharp preserved
observables.
      Consider a channel on B(H) of the form1
                                  X
                           E(ρ) =     λk |ψk ihψk |ρ|ψk ihψk |
                                           k

where the states |ψk i are normalized, but need not be orthogonal to each other.
This channel maps an observable Y with values in Ω to the observable X = Y ◦ E.
Explicitly,
                            X ∗ (α) = E ∗ (Y ∗ (α))
                                      X
                                    =      λi |ψi ihψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi ihψi |
                                           i
                                           X
                                       =       λi hψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi i|ψi ihψi |
                                           i

for all classical effects α ∈ L∞ (Ω). By construction, X ∗ is preserved by E. In fact,
it is also preserved by the complementary channel Ec . Using a basis {|ii}i of H, we
can write the complementary channel as
                               Xp
                     Ec∗ (B) =      λi λj |ψi ihψi |kihi|B|jihk|ψj ihψj |
                                 ijk
                                Xp
                              =   λi λj hi|B|ji|ψi ihψi |ψj ihψj |.
                                  ij

      This is an example of an entanglement-breaking channel
54                                                                           Preserved information


If we define an observable Z of the environment by
                                     X
                          Z ∗ (α) :=   hψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi i|iihi|
                                                i

then we have
                                        X
                      Ec∗ (Z ∗ (α)) =       λi hψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi i|ψi ihψi | = X ∗ (α)
                                        i

This proves that all the observables preserved by E are also preserved by Ec .
         In this case, this can also be seen by the fact that we can write2

                                               E = F ◦ Ec

for some channel F, which is given by the expression that we used to define Z from
Y:                                   X
                           F ∗ (A) =    hψi |A|ψi i|iihi|.
                                                    i

Therefore, for a channel of this form, all the information which is preserved in the
system also flows to the environment. This means that the whole of the information
preserved by E is broadcast, in the sense that this information is accessible from
both the system and the environment after the interaction. We saw in Section 3.3,
that the sharp observables broadcast in this way must form a commutative algebra.
    Clearly, this is not true of these broadcast unsharp effects. Indeed, it is easy
to see that the operators λk |ψk ihψk |, which need not commute with each other,
are preserved by E and therefore also by Ec . We will see in Section 5.3 that this
information is “classical”, but in a more general way. This is not surprising as the
channel E can be relayed by a classical system. Indeed, it could be simulated by
first measuring the observable Γ, with elements

                                            Γk = λk |ψk ihψk |,

and then preparing the state |ψk i corresponding to the outcome k of the mea-
surement. Note however that, as we will also see in Section 5.5.2, the information
broadcast between only two systems need not even be classical in that more general
sense.
    Another way of looking at this channel E is as a pre-measurement of the discrete
observables Γ defined above. This means that it describes the effect on the state
ρ of a certain measurement of Γ, if the actual outcome of the measurement is
traced-over or “forgotten”. In the notation of Section 2.1.6, the measurement is
defined by the partial channels Fk (ρ) = λk |ψk ihψk |ρ|ψk ihψk |. Note that Γ itself is at
     2
    In the literature, this property is summarized by saying that Ec degradable, while E is said to
be anti-degradable
Example: measurements                                                                55


best approximately preserved by E, in the sense that coarse-grainings (approximate
versions of) Γ are preserved, as for instance the observable with elements
                               X
                         Γ
                         ek =      λk |hψi |ψk i|2 Γi = E ∗ (Γk ).
                                 i

e can be considered an approximation of Γ because the distribution |hψi |ψk i| is
Γ
“peaked”at i = k. In the limit where the vectors |ψi i are orthogonal, |hψi |ψk i| →
δik . However, note that there exists non-trivial observables for which |hψi |ψk i| is
independent of k and i (which are the SIC-POVMs described in Section 5.5.3).
    The fact that the observable being measured is not preserved in the system
illustrates the well-known fact that two successive measurements of a POVM do
not yield the same outcome for sure. However, Γ is exactly preserved by the com-
plementary channel Ec . Indeed, we have
                                 Xp
                  Ec∗ (|kihk|) =     λi λj hi|kihk|ji|ψi ihψi |ψj ihψj |
                                 ij

                              = λk |ψk ihψk | = Γk

This is what is important for E to be a measurement of Γ: the apparatus (environ-
ment) must gain full information about Γ.
    It is always true that, if a channel represents the effect of a measurement, then
its complement exactly preserves the observable being measured. Indeed, recall
that in Section 2.1.6 we introduced a measurement by postulating that the chan-
nel describing the evolution of the system be complementary to the quantum-to-
classical channel defining the observable being measured, namely Γ. The quantum-
to-classical channel Γ can always be seen as a fully quantum channel by embedding
its target algebra into the full quantum algebra B(HE ). In addition Γ is always
preserved by Γ itself, since it is the image of the “identity” classical observable. Let
us illustrate this when Γ is discrete, with elements Γi . If we represent Γ as a full
quantum channel, its action is
                                         X
                                 Γ(ρ) =     Tr(ρΓi )|iihi|
                                          i

for some orthonormal basis |ii of the Hilbert space HE . The dual is
                                        X
                               Γ∗ (A) =    hi|A|iiΓi
                                              i

which implies that
                                      Γ∗ (|iihi|) = Γi
Hence Γ is the image under Γ of the sharp observable with eigenstates |ii, which is
the complete “universal” observable on the classical system Ω. In fact, Γ represented
as a quantum channel is the minimal channel preserving Γ itself, which makes sense.

These channels also have the property of being fully decoherent (see Section 5.4).



We will say more about this type of preserved information in Section 5.3 where we
will show that the information preserved by an observable represents in a sense the
most general way that classical information can be embedded in a quantum system.

     An important example of a channel of this type is given by replacing the states
|ψi i by the continuous set of coherent states. This “coherent-state channel” will be
studied in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.4.

3.5     Example: uncertainty relations
We will use the concept of preserved observable to show that an approximate mea-
surement of the position of a particle preserves an approximate momentum observ-
able, where the relationship between the precision of both is given by Heisenberg’s
uncertainty relations.
    Consider the position x̂ of a one-dimensional non-relativistic particle, which is
the multiplication operator on H = L2 (R). It will be convenient to follow the
tradition and use the improper eigenstates |xi of x̂. An approximate measurement
of this sharp observable can be represented by the unsharp observable X defined
by                                      Z
                                 ∗
                               X (α) =    α(y)Xy dy
                                           R
where the operators Xy are
                                  Z
                           Xy =       dx |G(x − y)|2 |xihx|

for a smearing function G(x), which could for instance be chosen to be a Gaussian
centered around zero. Note that since the observable x̂ does not in fact have
eigenstates, the proper way of defining Xy would be using functional calculus, as

                                 Xy = |G(x̂ − y1)|2 .

Normalization of the observable X implies
                               Z
                                 dy|G(x, y)|2 = 1.

The effect on the particle of a measurement of this observable could be given by
the channel                           Z
                                E(ρ) = Ey ρEy∗ dy

where the operators Ey are defined by
                          Z
                    Ey = dx G(x − y)|xihx| = G(y1 − x̂).

    Note that since this channel represents the effect of a measurement, we already
know that the information which flows to the environment is precisely the classical
information represented by the observable X being measured. The channel itself
however preserves a lots of information. In particular, it preserved exactly the sharp
position observable. Indeed, we have
                       Z
          E (|zihz|) = dy Ey∗ |zihz|Ey
           ∗

   Now suppose that we measure the momentum observable p̂ = i~ ∂x                 after the
channel has acted. If |pi represents the improper eigenstates of p̂, we have

gives an operational formulation of the uncertainty relation which works for a sin-
gle measurement, i.e. which does not rely on expectation values as in the original
formulation. It shows that if an observable is measured with a finite accuracy, the
information about the canonical conjugate is preserved up to an accuracy given by
the uncertainty relation.
   Note that the measurement which yields the channel E is naturally generated
by an interaction of the type

                                             Kx := νxp̂

we obtain
                        i
                                 X (−it/~)n

Therefore, if the initial state of the second system is |ψi, the channel describing the
evolution of the first system is

By |(y − x)νti, we mean the eigenstate of position with eigenvalue (y − x)νt. This
has the form of the approximate position measurement where the smearing function

                                G(y − x) = h(y − x)νt|ψi

depends on the initial state |ψi of the apparatus. Note that the second moment
of |G(x)|2 decreases linearly with time. Hence the measurement’s accuracy in-
creases continuously with time. However this fact would largely depend on the
self-Hamiltonian of the second system, which we neglected here.

Correctable information

In the previous chapter, we studied observables which are preserved by a channel
E, in the sense that they can be precisely simulated by another observable after the
channel has acted, no matter what the state was. Formally, X is preserved if there
exists Y such that
                                    X = Y ◦ E.
We have seen that when X is sharp, Y can be obtained from X via a channel R:

                                    Y = X ◦ R.

For these observables, we have

                                  X = X ◦ R ◦ E.

In this chapter, we will study in greater depth the class of observables which have
this property, i.e. which are correctable. Correctable observables are rare compared
to preserved observables, because they require the channel to have special symmetry
properties.
    We will characterize classes of observables correctable by a common channel R,
and show that they generalize the known quantum error correcting codes [26, 27, 28,
29, 30]. Our main result is a generalization of the Knill-Laflamme conditions [27]
to infinite-dimensional codes, and hybrid quantum-classical codes. Our approach
is close in spirit to the first concept of noiseless subsystem introduced in [23],
and technically relies on later results on the correctability of noiseless subsystems
[31, 32]. Some of the new results presented were published in [1, 2, 3].


4.1     Quantum error correction
Let us suppose that some information is sent through a channel E. The aim of error
correction is to find certain degrees of freedom, the error correcting code (whose
exact nature we deliberately keep imprecise for the moment), on which the effect of

                                         61
62                                                                 Correctable information


the channel can be inverted. Since the inversion must be implemented physically,
it must be a valid physical transformation, i.e. a channel. The inverse channel R is
called the correction channel. The fact that a channel E can always be written as
                                         X
                                  E(ρ) =     Ei ρEi∗
                                                i

means that we can always assume that the noise is given by a discrete family of
individual errors Ei .
    In fact we will see that if R corrects this channel on some code, then it would
correct also any channel whose elements span the same operator space as the el-
ements of E. This fact is important because often one does not know the precise
channel elements Ei . Indeed, suppose that the system interacts continuously with
its environment via a Hamiltonian H. The most general form of H would be
                                        X
                                   H=       Ji ⊗ Ki
                                            i

where the interaction operators Ji act on the system, and the operators Ki act on
the environment.
   Let us assume that the initial state of the environment is given by some vector
|ψi. It is unlikely that we know much about Ki or |ψi given that the environment
may be very large and complex. However, it is generally conceivable that we have
a good knowledge of what the operators Ji can be. If Et is the channel describing
the evolution of the system alone up to time t, we have
            Et∗ (A) = (1 ⊗ hψ|)eitH (A ⊗ 1)e−itH (1 ⊗ |ψi)
                      X
                    =    (1 ⊗ hψ|)eitH (1 ⊗ |ki)A(1 ⊗ hk|)e−itH (1 ⊗ |ψi)
                       k
                       X
                   =       Ek∗ (t)AEk (t)
                       k

where the channel elements are
                Ek (t) = (1 ⊗ hk|)e−itH (1 ⊗ |ψi)
                         X (−it)n
                       =            (1 ⊗ hk|)H n (1 ⊗ |ψi)
                          n
                                n!
                         X X (−it)n
                       =                  hk|Kj1 · · · Kjn |ψiJj1 · · · Jjn .
                          n j ...j
                                     n!
                               1   n


Hence the channel elements Ek (t) all belong to the algebra generated by the inter-
action operators Ji . At this point, we could try to find correctable codes for the
class of channels whose elements span this algebra. This is possible, but would in
fact result in codes which need no correction at all (i.e. noiseless subsystems [23]).
   However, if the time t at which we aim to perform the correction is small enough,
we can do better. Indeed, suppose that λ is some interaction parameter with unit
Correctable observables                                                             63


of energy, then the above series is expressed in powers of tλ. We see that to the nth
order in tλ, the elements of the channel are in the span of the nth order products
Jj1 · · · Jjn . Hence, if we correct often enough (in order to limit the value of tλ),
then we only need to find a correction channel and a code for channel elements in
the span of the operators Jj1 · · · Jjn , n < N , for a fixed N . In this context, the
operators Ji can be seen as representing independent errors. The goal is to find a
code as large as possible which corrects as many of these errors as possible.
   For clarity of the presentation we will stick to the simple picture where the
channel E is given. However we will keep the more realistic situation in mind and
check that the correction procedure we devised works not just for the given channel,
but also for any channel whose elements span the same space.


4.2      Correctable observables
Let us introduce a notion of correctability which fits our framework, and then
later show how we recover, as a special case, the known results of quantum error
correction. In this section we consider again a channel

                                E : Bt (H1 ) → Bt (H2 )

Definition 4.1. We say that an observable X is correctable for E if there is a
channel R, called the correction channel, which is such that

                                   X = X ◦ R ◦ E.

We then say that X is fixed by the channel R ◦ E.

   The operational meaning of this definition is clear. If X is fixed by R ◦ E, then
a measurement of X after the application of the channel E followed by R will yield
the same outcome as if nothing had happened to the system.
   It directly follows from this definition that if X is correctable, then it is also
preserved. Indeed it suffices to define the observable Y := X ◦ R to observe that
X = Y ◦ E. Preserved observables however are rarely correctable. Indeed, if X is
correctable then, in particular, the effect X/kXk is also correctable. This suffices to
show, for instance, that none of the preserved effects are correctable in the examples
shown in Figure 3.2, except for the case n = 2 where they are all correctable.
   We have already identified a class of preserved observables which are correctable,
namely the preserved sharp observables. Indeed, in order to prove Theorem 3.5, in
Section 3.2, we introduced the channel defined by Equation 3.9, namely
                                             1              1
                           R∗ (A) = Eλ (1)− 2 Eλ (A)Eλ (1)− 2

which was shown to correct all the preserved sharp observables.

     1. X is preserved by E,

     2. X is correctable for E,

     3. [X,
         b Ei Ej ] = 0 for all i, j.

   Note the similarity between this proposition and the one obtained in [45], for
an initially different concept of “preserved information”.


4.2.1       Simultaneously correctable observables
We know that, in fact, the sharp preserved observables can all be corrected with
the same correction channel. Let us explicitly define this concept.
Definition 4.2. A set of observables is said to be simultaneously correctable for
E if the observables it contains are all correctable in terms of the same correction
channel R, which means that they are all fixed by R ◦ E.

    Before we go further, let us remark that, contrary to what happened for pre-
served observables, the correctable observables are entirely characterized by the
simultaneously correctable effects. Indeed, it is clear that an observable X is fixed
by the channel F if and only if its effects X ∗ (α) are all fixed by F. Indeed, by
definition, X = X ◦ F if and only if X ∗ (α) = F ∗ (X ∗ (α)). More generally, any
set of observables having simultaneously correctable effects are simultaneously cor-
rectable.
     Let us state what we already know:
Proposition 4.2. The effects in the algebra

                      A = {A ∈ B(H1 ) | [A, Ei∗ Ej ] = 0 for all i, j}

are all simultaneously correctable by the channel defined in Equation 3.9.

    As noted above, this implies that the observables X with X ∗ (α) ∈ A are cor-
rectable by the same channel R. We will call A the correctable algebra for E. This is
justified by the fact that any other algebra spanned by correctable effects is inside
A. Indeed, such an algebra would be spanned by its projectors, but A already
contains all the correctable projectors.
   In general, a set of simultaneously preserved effects need not be characterized
by an algebra. However, if a set of effects is simultaneously correctable, then so
are any linear combinations which also form effects. Since, in addition, effects
are self-adjoint, this means that a set of simultaneously correctable effects will
always be characterized by an operator system S, i.e. a linear subspace S ⊆ B(H1 )
Correctable observables                                                              65


which is closed under the ∗-operation. Hence, if we say that an operator system
S is correctable, we mean that all the effects in it are correctable. In fact, given
that we only consider normal channels, then also any weak-∗ limit of such linear
combinations will be correctable by the same correction channel. Hence we only
need to consider weak-∗ closed operator systems.
   We will now show that many correctable operator systems can be obtained
thank to Proposition 4.2. Consider any subspace H0 ⊆ H1 , and let

                                       V : H0 → H1

be the isometry which embeds H0 into H1 . This means that the operator P0 :=
V V ∗ , defined on H1 , is the projector on the subspace H0 , whereas V ∗ V = 10 is the
identity inside H0 . We can define a new channel E0 by restricting the channel E to
the subspace H0 , which, physically, amounts to making sure that the initial state
is prepared inside H0 . Hence we define

                                    E0 (ρ) := E(V ρV ∗ )

whose dual is
                                   E0∗ (A) = V ∗ E ∗ (A)V
This channel has its own correctable algebra:

                      A0 = {A ∈ B(H0 ) | [A, V ∗ Ek∗ El V ] = 0}.

This algebra can be naturally embedded in B(H1 ) via the isometry V . Indeed,
the map A 7→ V AV ∗ from B(H0 ) to B(H1 ) is a normal ∗-homomorphism. Note
however that the identity on B(H0 ) is sent to the projector V V ∗ = P .
   The algebra V A0 V ∗ may or may not be a subalgebra of the correctable algebra
A. If it is not, then its effects are not correctable for the channel E itself. However,
we will see that it is one-to-one with a family of simultaneously correctable effects
which do not form an algebra. Indeed, let R0 be the correction channel for E0 ,
which is a channel from Bt (H2 ) to Bt (H0 ), and define the set

                                    S0 := E ∗ (R∗0 (A0 )).                        (4.1)

Note that S0 is not equal to A0 because we have used E ∗ instead of E0∗ in Equation
4.1. In fact, we have
                                  A0 = V ∗ S0 V.                              (4.2)
This subset S0 ⊂ B(H1 ) is in general not an algebra, but it is always an operator
system. We claim that all the effects which are in S0 are simultaneously correctable.
Indeed, for any effect A = E ∗ (R∗0 (B)) ∈ S0 , where B ∈ A0 , we have
                     E ∗ (R∗0 (V ∗ AV )) = E ∗ (R∗0 (V ∗ E ∗ (R∗0 (B))V ))
                                         = E ∗ (R∗0 (E0∗ (R∗0 (B))))
                                         = E ∗ (R∗0 (B))
                                         = A.
66                                                               Correctable information


Hence, the correction map is
                                     ρ 7→ V R0 (ρ)V ∗
which is a valid channel from Bt (H2 ) to Bt (H1 ).
   Hence, for any subspace H0 ⊆ H1 we can construct an operator system S0
whose effects are all simultaneously correctable. In addition, it is clear that all the
observables which are formed of effects in S0 are all simultaneously correctable.
     This proves the following:
Theorem 4.3. For every subspace H0 ⊆ H1 , the operator system S0 defined in
Equation 4.1 is such that all the observables X with X ∗ (α) ∈ S0 for all α are
simultaneously correctable.

    Let us summarize how to obtain S0 . We restricted the channel to the subspace
H0 , computed the correctable algebra A0 and the correction channel R0 for the
restricted channel, and finally set S0 = E ∗ (R∗0 (A0 )). In fact we can be entirely
explicit. Letting V be the isomorphism embedding H0 into H1 , P := V V ∗ the
projector on H0 , Eλ the regularized channel defined on the whole of B(H1 ), and
                                                      1
                                     K := (Eλ (P ))− 2
we have that the operator system
        S0 = {E ∗ (KEλ (V AV ∗ )K) | A ∈ B(H0 ), [A, V ∗ Ei∗ Ej V ] = 0 for all i, j}
is corrected on E by the channel
                                  R(ρ) = P Eλ∗ (KρK)P.
We will give an explicit example in Section 4.4.1.
    Do these structures exhaust all the correctable observables for E? Some light
could be cast on this question thank to theorem 3 of [45], the proof of which has
unfortunately not been published at the time of writing. The authors state that,
when H1 is finite-dimensional, the fixed point set of the dual of any channel must
be made of elements of the form A + F ∗ (A) where A belongs to a ∗-algebra A0
inside M(H0 ), H0 a subspace of H1 , and F ∗ is a fixed channel which is such that
P F ∗ (A)P = 0, where P projects onto H0 .
     If an operator system S is correctable for E, then it is fixed by E ∗ ◦ R∗ for some
channel R, and, according to [45], made of elements of the form mentioned above:
A + F ∗ (A). This means that if V is the isometry embedding H0 into H1 , we have
V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (A + F ∗ (A)))V = V ∗ (A + F ∗ (A))V = A, which implies that the algebra
A0 is correctable for E restricted to H0 , and therefore belongs to the correctable
algebra for this restricted channel. This shows that S is of the form covered by
Theorem 4.3, which therefore exhausts all correctable observables, at least in finite
dimension.
   In the next section we will see a reason why, for most applications, it is more
useful to make sure that the initial state is in the subspace H0 and work only with
the correctable algebra A0 , rather than working with the operator system S0 and
no restriction on states.
Correctable observables                                                            67


4.2.2     Simultaneously correctable channels
In section 4.1 we motivated a situation where, of the channel elements Ei , only
their span is known. It is already clear that the correctable algebra

                        A = {A | [A, Ei∗ Ej ] = 0 for all i, j}

only depends on the span of the elements Ei . Indeed,      consider a channel E with
                              0
                                                      P
elements Ei and  a
                P ∗channel  E   with elements   F i =  j ij j where γij are arbitrary,
                                                        γ  E
provided that i Fi Fi = 1. Then it is clear that an operator which commutes
with the products Ei∗ Ej for all i and j will also commute with operators Fi∗ Fj since
they are just linear combinations of the former. This fact tells us that A is the
correctable algebra for all channels whose elements are chosen in the span of the
operators Ei . However this fact alone would not be very helpful if the correction
channel itself depended on the particular choice of channel elements. Fortunately,
it does not.
   In fact, we have already exploited part of this freedom in defining R. Indeed,
remember that we defined it in terms of the map
                                       X
                              Eλ (A) =    λi Ei AEi∗
                                               i

defined on B(H1 ) (see Equation 3.6). The sequence λ was chosen so that the infinite
sum in the expression for Eλ is well defined for any operator. However the exact
value of the components λi did not matter in the proof that R corrects the algebra
A for the channel E. In fact, the only important aspect of this channel was that its
elements are linear combinations of the adjoints of the elements of E.
   The channel R0 correcting E 0 would be defined in the same way in terms of the
channel
                                    X
                          Eλ0 (A) =    λi Fi AFi∗
                                          i
                                         X
                                     =         λi γij γ ik Ej AEk∗
                                         ijk

which has also the right form for the corresponding correction channel
                                                      1              1
                       R0 (ρ) = (Eλ0 )∗ ((Eλ0 (1))− 2 ρ (Eλ0 (1))− 2 )

to correct the channel E. We will not go through the proof that R0 corrects E on
A, since precisely the same steps can be followed as for R itself.
    Hence we have seen that all the channels whose elements span the same space
of operators will have the same correctable algebra, and be correctable through the
same correction channel. This means that this theory can be applied to the case
described in Section 4.1, where the span of the elements is all that we know about
the channel.
68                                                                Correctable information


    There is a sense in which it is this fact which allows for the quantum errors to
be understood as being discrete [35]. Indeed, a standard error model for quantum
computing is that where the system considered is a tensor product of qubits, namely
two-dimensional quantum systems. The possible “errors” (i.e. possible channel el-
ements of the noise) are supposed to be any operator acting on no more than n
subsystems, where n is fixed. It is clear that this set of errors is continuous. How-
ever, for a finite number of qubits their span is separable (in fact finite-dimensional),
which means that it suffices to choose a discrete set which spans the space and try
to correct these only.
    This discussion applies to simultaneously correctable sets of observables charac-
terized by an algebra, which are the correctable sharp observables. However, it does
not apply to the classes of simultaneously correctable unsharp observables identified
in the previous section. Indeed, in those cases the correctable operator systems S0
may be different for two channels whose elements span the same operator space.
Indeed, remember that
                                  S0 = E ∗ (R∗0 (A0 )).
where A0 is the correctable algebra for the channel restricted to a subspace H0 ,
and R0 the corresponding correction channel. Therefore, although both R0 and
A0 would be the same for both channels, the set S0 in this expression depends
explicitly of the action of the channel itself, and may be different in both cases.


4.2.3     Nature of correctable channels

The fact that A is the correctable algebra for the channel E, with correction channel
R, implies that the map E ∗ ◦ R∗ acts simply as the identity on A:

                                   (E ∗ ◦ R∗ )|A = idA

The following theorem elucidates what happens to the algebra A prior to its cor-
rection:

Theorem 4.4. Let A be the correctable algebra for a channel E. Then E ∗ is a nor-
mal ∗-homomorphism of the algebra generated by the pre-image of A. In particular,
for any operators B, B 0 such that E ∗ (B), E ∗ (B 0 ) ∈ A, we have

                               E ∗ (BB 0 ) = E ∗ (B)E ∗ (B 0 ).


Proof. Remember, that the projectors P in the correctable algebra A satisfy BEi =
Ei P for some operator B, and for all i (see Equation 3.4). It can be directly checked
that this is also true of the span of the projectors, which is almost the whole of
the algebra A, up to closure. Now consider two operators B and B 0 such that
A := E ∗ (B) and A0 := E ∗ (B 0 ) belong to the span of the projectors of A. We know
Correctable observables                                                           69


that BEi = Ei A and B 0 Ei = Ei A0 . This implies that BB 0 Ei = BEi A0 = Ei AA0 ,
from which it follows that
                                X               X
                  E ∗ (BB 0 ) =   Ei∗ BB 0 Ei =   Ei∗ Ei AA0 = AA0
                                  i                       i
                                  ∗       ∗           0
                             = E (B)E (B ).

Since E ∗ is weak-∗ continuous, this condition also applies to the weak-∗ closure of
the set of operators whose images are in the span of the projectors of A. This shows
that the above condition holds for every operators in the pre-image of A.
   Note that the pre-image of A under E ∗ includes in particular the image of the
dual of any correction channel R.
   In fact, the correction channel defined in Equation 3.9 is itself a homomorphism.
We saw in the above proof that for all operators A in the span of the projectors of
A, we have R∗ (A)Ei = Ei A. This implies that

                                  R∗ (A)Eλ (1) = Eλ (A).

which means explicitly
                                      1                       1
                           (Eλ (1))− 2 Eλ (A)(Eλ (1)) 2 = Eλ (A).

or, simply,
                                                  1
                                 [(Eλ (1))− 2 , Eλ (A)] = 0.
From the weak-∗ continuity of Eλ , we have that this is true for all A ∈ A. Using
this fact, and also recalling that [A, Ei∗ Ej ] = 0 for all A ∈ A, we have
                                              1                               1
              R∗ (A)R∗ (A0 ) = (Eλ (1))− 2 Eλ (A)(Eλ (1))−1 Eλ (A0 )(Eλ (1))− 2
                                              3                       1
                             = (Eλ (1))− 2 Eλ (A)Eλ (A0 )(Eλ (1))− 2
                                              3                           1
                             = (Eλ (1))− 2 Eλ (1)Eλ (AA0 )(Eλ (1))− 2
                                              1                   1
                             = (Eλ (1))− 2 Eλ (AA0 )(Eλ (1))− 2
                             = R∗ (AA0 ).

Hence, we proved the following proposition:

Proposition 4.5. The correction channel given by Equation 3.9 is a faithful rep-
resentation of the correctable von Neumann algebra A.

    This shows that the effect of a channel on its correctable algebra simply amounts
to representing it in a different way on the Hilbert space. These results clarify
certain aspects of [47]. We refer to [3] for the precise relationship between our
results and those of [47].
70                                                         Correctable information


4.3     Error correcting codes
In Section 4.1 we mentioned that the purpose of quantum error correction was
to find a “code” on which the channel can be inverted, without defining what we
meant by a code. In the previous section, we started from the general assumption
that a code should be a set of simultaneously correctable observables. We have
then found that for any subsystem H0 of the source Hilbert space H1 , we have a set
of simultaneously correctable observables characterized by an operator system S0 ,
or equivalently by the von Neumann algebra A0 which is such that A0 = V ∗ S0 V
where V is the isometry embedding H0 into H1 . The algebra A0 characterizes the
sharp observables correctable for the channel restricted to the subspace H0 .
    Hence, all the codes that we identified, on which the channel can be inverted,
are, or correspond to, von Neumann algebras. In fact it easy to build abstract
examples which yield any possible von Neumann algebra in this way, given that
all von Neumann algebras can be defined as the commutant of an arbitrary set of
operators.
   In order to understand the type of information represented by von Neumann
algebras, we need to know how they look like.


4.3.1    Structure of von Neumann algebras
Let us first summarize the representation theory of finite-dimensional von Neumann
algebras, which are just ∗-algebras.
    A concrete finite-dimensional ∗-algebra A, represented by matrices, i.e. opera-
tors on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, always has the form
                                    N
                                    M
                               A=         Mnk ⊗ 1mk                            (4.3)
                                    k=1

where Mnk denotes the full set of matrices on an nk -dimensional Hilbert space,
and 1mk the identity on an mk -dimensional  P Hilbert     space. If the dimension of
                                                 2
the algebra A is D then we have D =            n
                                              k k  .   The  direct sum of two matrix
algebras must be understood as the algebra of block-diagonal matrices, with one
block encoding the first algebra, and the other block the second algebra. Therefore
the above means that, written as a matrix of blocks,
                                                                    
                      Mn1 ⊗ 1m1         0        ···          0
                          0        Mn2 ⊗ 1m2 · · ·           0      
             A=                                                     .
                                                                    
                            ..           ..       ..           ..
                            .            .          .          .    
                           0            0        · · · MnN ⊗ 1mN

In addition, tensoring a matrix algebra with the identity on another algebra means
that we are considering matrices which are also block-diagonal, with as many blocks

as there are elements on the diagonal of the identity matrix, but such that each
blocks are all identical, not only in their size, but also in their content.
   For instance, any operator A in the algebra A = (M2 ⊗ 12 ) ⊕ (M3 ) has the
form                                         
                                     B 0 0
                              A = 0 B 0
                                     0 0 C
for a two-by-two matrix B and a three-by-three matrix C.
   The block-diagonal structure of A is determined by the form of its center Z(A).
The center is the set of operators inside the algebra which commute with all other
elements of the algebra:

                   Z(A) = {A ∈ A | [A, B] = 0 for all B ∈ A }.

It is a commutative algebra. The center can also be written as the intersection of
the algebra with its commutant A0 which is the algebra composed of all operators
commuting with all elements of A:

                                 Z(A) = A ∩ A0 .

For instance, for an algebra of the form Mn ⊗ 1m , we have

                 Z(Mn ⊗ 1m ) = (Mn ⊗ 1m ) ∩ (1n ⊗ Mm ) ≈ C.

A von Neumann algebra is said to be a factor if its center is isomorphic to C. Hence
matrix algebras of the form Mn ⊗ 1m are factors.
   More generally, if the representation of A is expressed as in Equation 4.3, then
the commutant is
                                    MN
                                 0
                               A =       1nk ⊗ Mmk
                                     k=1

and the center of A is
                                     N
                                     M
                            Z(A) =             C(1nk ⊗ 1mk )                   (4.4)
                                     k=1

which means that it is composed of diagonal matrices with only N different eigen-
values. If Pk is the projector on the kth block, then this means that a generic
element C ∈ Z(A) of the center is of the form
                                       X
                                  C=       ck P k
                                               k

for arbitrary complex numbers ck . The algebra A itself is block-diagonal in terms
of the subspaces defines by the projectors Pk , in the sense that for all A ∈ A,
                                      X
                                 A=       Pk APk .

Hence the center of the algebra essentially tells us what the blocks are in its repre-
sentation.
   For instance, consider again the algebra A = (M2 ⊗ 12 ) ⊕ (M3 ). Typical
operators A ∈ A, A0 ∈ A0 and C ∈ A have the form
                                                               
            B 0 0                a12 b12 0            a12 0       0
     A =  0 B 0  A0 =  c12 d12 0  C =  0 a12 0 
            0 0 C                 0    0 x13           0     0 x13

where a, b, c, d, x ∈ C, B is any 2-by-2 matrix, and C any 3-by-3 matrix.
    When A is infinite-dimensional, the direct sum must be replaced by a direct
integral. This follows from the fact that the center can be any commutative algebra,
which has the form
                                   Z(A) ≈ L∞ (Ω)
for some set Ω equipped with a measure. It is with respect to this measure that we
can write                           Z ⊕
                                   A≈         A(x) dx
                                          Ω
Where the generalized “blocks” A(x) are factors, i.e. have a trivial center. If Ω
is finite then we must use a discrete measure, which gives us the direct sum in
Equation 4.4. Hence this integral can be intuitively understood as a continuous
limit of the direct sum.
    Factors come in three main types. Up to now we have been using type I factors,
which are always of the form B(H) for some Hilbert space H. Factors of type II
or III are more exotic. An example of a factor of type II will be studied in Section
4.4.4.


4.3.2     Standard codes and subsystem codes
Traditionally, a quantum error correcting code is just a subspaces H0 of the initial
finite-dimensional Hilbert space H1 , which is assumed to be finite-dimensional [35].
The idea is that the channel E is correctable for states in H0 if there is a channel
R such that
                                   R(E(ρ)) = ρ
for all states ρ which are mixtures of pure states in the subspace H0 . If we introduce
the isometry V : H0 → H1 which embeds H0 into H1 , this means that

                                 R(E(V ρV ∗ )) = V ρV ∗

for all ρ ∈ Bt (H0 ), which is equivalent to requiring the existence of a channel R0
such that
                                  R0 (E(V ρV ∗ )) = ρ
for all ρ ∈ Bt (H0 ). Indeed, it suffices to pick R0 (ρ) = V ∗ R(ρ)V .
Error correcting codes                                                                  73


    If we define E0 (ρ) := E(V ρV ∗ ), this means that R0 ◦ E0 is the identity on Bt (H0 ),
or equivalently that E ∗ ◦ (R0 )∗ is the identity on B(H0 ), which, as we have shown
matches our conception of correctability for the algebra B(H0 ). Therefore we re-
cover the framework of standard quantum error correction, for a code H0 , when
the correctable algebra is B(H0 ), and the channel is restricted to the subspace H0 .
    In order to complete the comparison, let us check that our correctability con-
dition reduces to the one introduced for standard codes [27]. The Knill-Laflamme
condition states that a standard code represented by the subspace H0 is correctable
for the channel E with elements Ei if there exists λij ∈ C such that
                            V ∗ Ei∗ Ej V = λij 1   for all i, j                      (4.5)
where V embeds H0 into the source Hilbert space H1 . In our framework, the
correctable algebra must be precisely the commutant of the operators V ∗ Ei∗ Ej V
for all i and j. Since here they are all proportional to the identity on H0 , the
correctable algebra is indeed the whole algebra of operators on H0 .
    A more general framework was also introduced which generalized the notion of a
code to that of a subsystem code [31, 32]. In this approach one defines a code through
a subspace H0 ⊆ H1 and a particular subsystem decomposition HA ⊗ HB = H0 of
this subspace. Again, let V be the isometry embedding H0 into H1 . We then say
that the subsystem HA is a correctable code if there is a channel R such that
                              R(E(V (ρ ⊗ τ )V ∗ )) = ρ ⊗ τ 0
for any states ρ ∈ Bt (HA ), τ, τ 0 ∈ Bt (HB ). We want to show that this is equivalent
to the case where the correctable algebra A, in our framework, is any factor of type
I, which in this case is
                                    A = B(HA ) ⊗ 1A .
That is, assuming that we are restricting the initial state to the subspace H0 . In
our language, this would mean that
                             V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (X ⊗ 1))V = X ⊗ 1                           (4.6)
for all X ∈ B(HA ). Indeed, suppose first that HA is a subsystem code corrected by
R , then we have that for all X ∈ B(HA ),
         Tr(V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (X ⊗ 1))V (ρ ⊗ σ)) = Tr((X ⊗ 1)R(E(V ρ ⊗ σV ∗ )))
                                           = Tr(Xρ ⊗ τ ) = Tr(Xρ)Tr(τ )
                                           = Tr(Xρ) = Tr((X ⊗ 1)(ρ ⊗ σ)).
This is true for all states ρ ∈ Bt (HA ) and all states σ ∈ B(Ht (HB )). By linearity
it follows that V ∗ E ∗ (X ⊗ 1)V = X ⊗ 1 for all X ∈ B(HA ). Conversely, if Equation
4.6 is true for all X, then for all ρ ∈ B(H0 ) we have
                Tr(X TrB (R(E(V ρV ∗ )))) = Tr((X ⊗ 1)R(E(V ρV ∗ )))
                                          = Tr(V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (X ⊗ 1))V ρ)
                                          = Tr((X ⊗ 1)ρ)
                                          = Tr(X TrB (ρ)).
74                                                             Correctable information


Since the above equation is true for all X, we have TrB (R(E(V ρV ∗ ))) = TrB (ρ) for
all ρ ∈ Bt (H0 ), which was shown in [32] to be equivalent to the definition of HA
being a noiseless subsystem for E.
     In this framework, the correctability condition reads [31]

                                 V ∗ Ei∗ Ej V = 1 ⊗ Λij                           (4.7)

for an arbitrary set of operators Λij ∈ B(HB ). This means that the operators
V ∗ Ei∗ Ej V for all i and j generate the sub-algebra 1 ⊗ B(HB ) of B(H0 ), whose
commutant is indeed B(HA ) ⊗ 1: the correctable algebra defining the subsystem
code.
   Note that a subsystem code can always also be identified as a standard code,
provided that we can afford to put stronger constraints on the initial state. Indeed,
consider the smaller subspace H00 formed by the states inside H0 which are of the
form |ψi ⊗ |φ0 i, where |φ0 i is fixed. This subspace is associated with the isometry
W = V ⊗ |φ0 i, for which we have

                              W ∗ Ei∗ Ej W = hφ0 |Λij |φ0 i1

which is just the Knill-Laflamme condition for H00 .
    These results show that the standard codes, as well as the subsystems codes,
correspond to the case where our correctable algebra is a finite-dimensional factor,
which is always of type I. Our results yield two types of generalization over these
codes. Firstly, we obtain a characterization of infinite-dimensional quantum codes
and continuous classical codes, which will be discussed briefly in Section 4.3.4. In
addition, we can correct information which is not quantum nor classical, i.e. which
is represented by an algebra which is not commutative nor a factor.


4.3.3      Hybrid codes
We have seen that in our framework, the structure to be corrected, i.e. representing
the code, can be any von Neumann algebra. A general von Neumann algebra with
center Z(A) = L∞ (Ω) is of the form
                                     Z ⊕
                                A=        A(x)dx                               (4.8)
                                          Ω

where each A(x) is a factor. If the center is maximal, i.e. Z(A) = A, then the
algebra A is commutative and each factor A(x) is of dimension one, i.e. isomorphic
to the complex numbers C. If, on the other hand, the center is minimal, i.e.
Z(A) ≈ C, then the set Ω contains only a single element x0 and A = A(x0 ) is a
factor.
    If A is commutative, then it represents a classical system, which is clear from
the fact that it has the form L∞ (Ω). It is then natural to say that if it is a factor,
it represents a “pure” quantum system.
Error correcting codes                                                           75


    A physical system represented by an algebra, whose structure is given by the
general form 4.8, can be understood as being partly quantum and partly classi-
cal. Indeed, we can consider the center Z(A) = L∞ (Ω) as representing a classical
system. For each possible “state” x ∈ Ω of this classical system, we have a pure
quantum system represented by the factor A(x).
   For instance, a classical system, represented by L∞ (Ω), next to a type I quantum
system, with algebra B(H), is represented by
                                                  Z ⊕
                               ∞
                         A = L (Ω) ⊗ B(H) ≃             A(x)dx
                                                   Ω

where each factor A(x) is a copy of B(H). In the more general case however, the
size and type of the algebra A(x) may depend upon x.
                              R⊕
    Generic operators A, B ∈ Ω A(x) dx are of the form
                             Z                  Z
                        A=     Ax dx and B =        Bx dx                 (4.9)
                              Ω                         Ω

Where Ax , Bx ∈ A(x) for all x ∈ Ω. Their product is simply
                                     Z
                               AB =     Ax Bx dx.
                                              Ω

An element of the center is of the form
                                      Z
                                 C=     α(x)1x dx
                                          Ω

where α ∈ L∞ (Ω) and 1x is the identity on Ax .
    If A in Equation 4.9 is an effect, then each operator Ax is also an effect which
can be interpreted as a quantum proposition which is true conditionally on the
classical system being in state x.
   If the finite-dimensional case, if a hybrid algebra
                                      M
                                A=        Mnk ⊗ 1mk
                                      k

is correctable, then each factor Ak = Mnk ⊗1mk represents a correctable subsystem
code for states restricted to the subspace Hk projected onto by Pk = 1nk ⊗ 1mk .
Indeed, if V is the isometry corresponding to Pk , then V AV ∗ is the representation
inside A of an operator A ∈ Ak . Therefore

                     V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (V AV ∗ ))V = V ∗ V AV ∗ V = A.

Therefore, a finite-dimensional hybrid algebra can be understood as representing a
family of orthogonal subsystem codes correctable simultaneously.
76                                                           Correctable information


4.3.4     Infinite-dimensional subsystem codes
The derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for error correction of infinite-
dimensional algebras is an interesting new result, given that all physical systems
are naturally modeled by infinite-dimensional systems. In particular, it yields a
formulation of quantum error correction for systems characterized by continuous
variables [48].
    A code can be said to be purely quantum if it is represented by an algebra
which is a factor. In the finite-dimensional case, we have seen in Section 4.3.2 that
factors represent subsystem codes characterized by Equation 4.7, or Equation 4.5.
Some authors assumed that this condition would hold unchanged in the infinite-
dimensional case. For instance, in [49] the Knill-Laflamme condition was expressed
for a channel with continuous elements Ex as
                                V ∗ Ex∗ Ey V = λ(x, y)1
where λ(x, y) ∈ C. Our results show that this condition is sufficient. Indeed, it
implies that the commutant of the operators V ∗ Ex∗ Ey V for all x and y is the whole
algebra M(H0 ) on the subspace H0 ⊆ H1 . However, in infinite dimension this con-
dition is no longer necessary since it expresses that the code must be isomorphic
to M(H0 ), which is a factor of type I. Hence it misses the possibility of correcting
more general factors. This means that our generalization of quantum error cor-
rection to infinite-dimensional systems introduces new types of quantum codes not
previously considered, namely factors of type II and III. An example of correctable
type II factor is given in Section 4.4.4 below.


4.4      Examples
Let us conclude this chapter by giving a few examples demonstrating features of
the new type of codes that we obtained.


4.4.1     Operator system
We can easily construct examples of correctable operator systems which are not
algebras by taking any algebraic code correctable on a subspace H0 ⊆ H1 , and
using the correction channel to “lift” it to an operator system correctable without
restriction on states, as explained in Section 4.2.1. As an example, we will take the
simplest standard code which corrects any random bit flip. This code is defined
by a two-dimensional subspace H0 ∼ C2 of a three-qubit Hilbert system H1 . It
is chosen such that the whole algebra of operators on the subspace is correctable
for any channel with elements in the span of the “error operators” {1, X1 , X2 , X3 }
where Xi is a Pauli matrix acting on the ith qubit. The subspace H0 is defined by
the isometry
                                      V |ii = |iiii
Examples                                                                                        77


where i ∈ {0, 1} and we wrote |iiii = |ii ⊗ |ii ⊗ |ii. We also define

                        P := V V ∗ = |000ih000| + |111ih111|.

It is easy to check that a correction channel for this code is
                                            X
                         R† (A) = V AV ∗ +      Xi V AV ∗ Xi
                                                             i

i.e., V ∗ E ∗ (R∗ (A))V = A for all A ∈ M(H0 ).
   The algebra correctable on the code H0 , as seen embedded in B(H1 ) is
                                       nX                            o
             V A0 V ∗ = V M(H0 )V ∗ =        αij |iiiihjjj| : αij ∈ C
                                                        ij


    In order to proceed, we need a specific error channel. We will pick one which
corresponds to assigning a probability for the occurrence of each error in the set
{1, X1 , X2 , X3 }:                       X
                            E(ρ) = p0 ρ +     pi Xi ρXi .
                                                        i

Writing X0 := 1 for convenience, the operator system
                                 1
                                nX              3
                                                X                                           o
        S0 = E ∗ (R∗ (A0 )) =            αij           pk Xk Xl |iiiihjjj|Xl Xk : αij ∈ C
                                 i,j=0         k,l=0

4.4.2     Classical channels
Formally, we only derived our results for quantum channels. However we can deduce
what happens in the case of a channel between two classical systems. For simplicity,
let us consider the finite-dimensional case. A classical channel

                                   π : L(Ω1 ) → L(Ω2 ).

can be represented by a quantum channel

                           E : M(L2 (Ω1 )) → M(L2 (Ω2 ))

defined by                                X
                                E(ρ) =              πij hj|ρ|ji|iihi|.
                                               ij
78                                                                           Correctable information


where                                        X
                                                   πij = 1.
                                               i

This means that the channel elements are
                                                   √
                                       Eij =           πij |iihj|.

In order to make sure that our scheme is entirely classical, we want to check that
the correction channel R is classical. In finite dimension, it can be constructed as

                                       R(ρ) = E ∗ (KρK)
                        1
where K := (E(1))− 2 . Clearly K is diagonal in our basis |ii, and E ∗ maps diagonal
operators to diagonal operators. Therefore R represents a classical channel.
     In order to find the correctable algebra, note that
                                                √
                                  Eij† Ekl = δik πij πil |jihl|.
                      P
A classical effect α = k αk |kihk| is correctable if and only if it commutes with all
these operators, i.e.
                 X√                            X√
                      πij πil αk |kihk|jihl| =    πij πil αk |jihl|kihk| ∀i, j, l
                    k                                    k
       ⇐⇒                      αj πij πil |jihl| = αl πij πil |jihl|                     ∀i, j, l
       ⇐⇒                    (αj − αl )πij πil = 0                                       ∀i, j, l


Hence, the effect α can be corrected if and only if αj = αk for all the states k, j
which are such that there exists i with πij 6= 0 and πik 6= 0. This simply means
that two states cannot be distinguished from each other when there is a nonzero
probability for a transition from a common state to both of them.
     Let us see what the correction channel does explicitly. First, note that
                            1                     1                1

                K = (E(1))− 2 = (    πij |iihi|)− 2 =  (    πij )− 2 |iihi|

                                                                                         P
where the sum over i is restricted
                             P            to  the   the  terms  which    are such  that    j πij 6=
0.
P    Let   us  define K i :=    π
                               j ij .  The      correction   channel   on  a  classical state ρ =
   i µi |iihi| is
                             X µi                          X µi πik
                      R(ρ) =     P          E ∗ (|iihi|) =     P        |kihk|.
                              i      j π ij
                                                            ik   j π ij


Expressed as a stochastic matrix, it has components
                                                    πji
                                            πijR = P       .
                                                     k πjk
Examples                                                                              79


Note that the stochastic matrix element πji is the probability that the channel π
would output the state j if the input was i. We see that this correction channel does
the following: if it is fed with the state j, it randomly outputs any of the states i for
which πji 6= 0. Indeed, it has no way of knowing which one of these was the initial
state. However it knows that it could not have been any other state. Clearly the
correction works exactly only if there is no ambiguity, i.e. if j could have come only
from a single state i. This is why the correctable observables are those which do not
distinguish between two states which have a non-zero probability of transitioning
to the same output state j.


4.4.3     Failed teleportation
We can view the standard quantum teleportation protocol [50] as an example of
quantum error correction. Indeed, Bob must find a way to reconstruct Alice’s quan-
tum information from the classical bits she provides, and his half of the entangled
pair.
   Here we will use our framework to show that if some of the classical information
gets lost in the way, Bob will only be able to reconstruct a hybrid.
   For teleportation to be possible, Bob and Alice must initially share a pair of
entangled qubits. This pair is described by the state
                                  1
                           |ψi = √ (|0i ⊗ |0i + |1i ⊗ |1i).
                                   2
Beside her entangled qubit, Alice possesses an other qubit in an arbitrary state ρ
that she wants to transmit to Bob. The point of the protocol is that she is not
allowed to send Bob any quantum information. This means that all she can do is
to perform some measurement on her pair of qubits, and send the classical result
to Bob (see Figure 4.1).
   The measurement that she must perform is the one defined by the basis of four
orthogonal maximally entangled states, which can be obtain by applying the Pauli
matrices to one half of |ψi. Hence the observable’s elements are

                       Xi = (1 ⊗ Ui )|ψihψ|(1 ⊗ Ui∗ ) = |ψi ihψi |

where U0 = 1 and Ui = σiPfor i ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Note that Ui∗ = Ui . One can check
by direct calculation that i Xi = 1. These states are all maximally entangled
because they are obtained by local transformations of a maximally entangled state.
The key property of these states is the following:

                          |ψi i = (1 ⊗ Ui )|ψi = (Ui ⊗ 1)|ψi.

   The channel from Alice to Bob is:

                             E(ρ) = (X ⊗ id)(ρ ⊗ |ψihψ|)

Figure 4.1: Left: standard teleportation circuit. Time runs from bottom to top.
The input is Alice’s quantum state to be teleported. The first half disk is a maxi-
mally entangled Bell state of two qubits. The second half disk represents a measure-
ment in the Bell basis, the output of which is classical information (the outcome of
the measurement). This classical information together with the second entangled
qubit are given to Bob who decodes the information by applying a unitary trans-
form on the qubits, conditioned on the classical information. Right: what should
Bob do, and how much of the quantum information can he recover, if some of the
classical information is lost in the way?
Examples                                                                            81


where id is the identity channel on Bob’s half of |ψi. To expand this, note that if
we represent the classical target system of X in terms of diagonal quantum states,
we have, for an arbitrary state ρ0 of Alice’s couple of qubits,
                            X                      X
                  X(ρ0 ) =      Tr(Xi ρ0 )|iihi| =   |iihψi |ρ0 |ψi ihi|

Therefore,

Once Bob receives this state, it is clear that he just has to measure the classical
system, and apply the inverse of the corresponding unitary transformation in order
to recover the state ρ.
   From the point of view of quantum error correction, we can see that the qubit
can indeed be recovered by computing the operators Ei∗ Ej where

                                             1
                                         Ei = |ii ⊗ Ui .
                                             2
Indeed, we have
                           Ei∗ Ej ∝ hi|ji ⊗ Ui† Uj = δij Ui† Ui = δij 1.
This shows that the whole algebra of operators on the qubit is correctable.
   Note that we can teleport n qubits simply by applying this protocol to each
qubits in parallel, which requires also n entangled pairs shared between Alice and
Bob. In this case the channel from Alice to Bob is
                                         1 X            (n) (n)
                              En (ρ) =        |iihi| ⊗ Ui ρUi
                                         4n i
82                                                                            Correctable information


where ρ is now an n qubits state, and Ui , i = 0, . . . , 4n − 1 are all possible tensor
products of Pauli operators and identity operators.
   An interesting aspect of this teleportation protocol is that, in a way, the quan-
tum state to be transmitted is entirely encoded in the classical information being
transmitted. More precisely, n qubits seem to be encoded in 2n classical bits. But
how is this encoding done? We will try to clarify this question by answering a more
precise one: what aspects of the quantum information do we loose if we destroy
some of the classical information?
    The most general way of destroying some of the classical information transmit-
ted from Alice to Bob consists in applying a classical channel π to it (see Figure
4.1). The channel elements of the classical channel are (see Section 4.4.2)
                                                   √
                                          Fij =        πij |iihj|

so that the overall channel from Alice to Bob has elements
                              1√                (n)     1√            (n)
                   Fij Ek =     πij |iihj|ki ⊗ Uk = δjk    πij |ii ⊗ Uj .
                              2                         2
The relevant operators for determining the correctable sharp observables are, drop-
ping the unimportant factors 21 ,
                                                         √                     (n) (n)
                      Ek∗ Fij∗ Fi0 j 0 Ek0 ∝ δjk δj 0 k0 πij πi0 j 0 hi|i0 i Uj Uj 0
                                                             √              (n) (n)
                                           = δjk δj 0 k0 δii0 πij πij 0 Uj Uj 0 .

Therefore, the correctable sharp effects are those commuting with the operators
                                          √         (n) (n)
                                           πij πik Uj Uk

for all i, j, k.
   An effect may commute with one of these operators for one of two reasons.
Either it is invariant under the corresponding transformation, or

                                              πij πik = 0.

Remember from the classical error correction example (Section 4.4.2), that this con-
dition on π means that the classical state j cannot be distinguished from the state
k because of the noise. Hence, whenever the noise erases the distinction between
two classical states j and k, the observables that Bob can recover must be invariant
                                       (n) (n)
under the unitary transformation Uj Uk . This result can be understood as im-
plying that the classical information encodes how Bob’s qubit must be transformed
in order to recover Alice’s state, which is in fact precisely how Bob effectively inter-
prets it. If the information about which transformation to apply is lost, then the
observables which can be recovered are those which do not distinguish between the
outcomes of the two transformations.
Examples                                                                                83


    For instance, in the case n = 1, suppose that we loose the distinction between
j = 0 and k = 3, which corresponds to the unitary operators 1 and σz . The
correctable observables must then commute with σz , which implies that they must
be diagonal. Therefore they only represent one single bit of information from Alice’s
qubit. However, if we also loose the distinction between the states 1 and 2, the
correctable information is exactly the same. Indeed, the new symmetry that must
be imposed in this case is σx σy ∝ σz . This shows that our error correction technique
misses some information in the former case.
   Recall that the correctable information is characterized by the sharp preserved
observables. In order to see what happens in more detail, we would need to look
at the preserved unsharp observables. For simplicity, let us simply consider the
preserved unsharp effects. Note that an effect of the hybrid quantum-classical
system of Bob is of the form
                                    X
                               B=      βi |iihi| ⊗ Bi .
                                        i

Its image in the Heisenberg picture is
           1X                    1
      A=        πij βi Uj Bi Uj = [β0 (B0 + σz B0 σz ) + β1 σx B1 σx + β2 σy B2 σy ].
           4 ij                  4

We can always choose β1 = β2 = 1, and B1 and B2 in order to obtain any effect for
the second and third term. However, the term
                                          X
                        B0 + σz B0 σz = 2   |iihi|B0 |iihi|
                                               i

is always diagonal. Therefore we can write all the preserved effects as
                                      1  1
                                    A= D+ B
                                      2  2
where B is an arbitrary effect, and D is any diagonal effect. The further loss of
the distinction between the states 1 and 2 would also force the second terms to be
diagonal, so that only diagonal effects are then preserved.


4.4.4     Irrational rotation algebra

Consider the algebra generated by two elements x̂ and p̂ satisfying the canonical
commutation relations
                                  [x̂, p̂] = i1.
This algebra can be represented on H = L2 (R), where the position operator x̂ acts
on a function ψ ∈ L2 (R) as (x̂ψ)(x) = xψ(x) and the momentum p̂ as (p̂ψ)(x) =
   d
i dx ψ(x).
84                                                                        Correctable information


    Suppose that this
                  P system interacts with an environment through a Hamiltonian
of the form H = i Ji ⊗ Ki , where the operators Ji act on the system, and the
operators Ki on the environment. We have seen in Section 4.1 that this implies that
the channel elements of the resulting channel on the system belong to the algebra
generated by the operators Ji .
    We will now suppose that the interaction operators Ji are of two forms. Some
are periodic functions of x̂, with period Lx , and others are periodic functions of p̂, of
period Lp . This implies that these functions are linear combinations of powers of the
                  2π            i 2π p
functions x 7→ ei Lx x or p 7→ e Lp respectively (their discrete Fourier components).
For convenience, let us define
                                         2π                          2π

                                         Lx                          Lp

The von Neumann algebra generated by the interaction operators is also generated
by the two unitary operators

                             U = eiωx x̂          and V = eiωp p̂

In addition, we assume that the real number
                                                     ωx ωp
                                              θ :=
                                                      2π
is irrational. This number is important because it enters into the commutator of U
and V :
                                  U V = e2πiθ V U.

    In principle, in order to find the correctable algebra, we need to find the op-
erators commuting with the products Ei∗ Ej of the channel elements Ei . However,
since we only know the span of these operators, we cannot exclude that Ei = 1
for some i. If this is the case, then these products include Ei and Ei∗ for all i.
Therefore, for an effects to be correctable, it needs to be in the commutant of the
von-Neumann algebra generated by the operators Ei for all i, which is the same as
the von Neumann algebra generated by the interaction operators Ji .
     The operators
                                         ωx                          ωp
                            U 0 = ei θ x̂         and V 0 = ei θ p̂
commute with both U and V . To see that U 0 commutes with V , simply note that:
                                     ωx ωp              2πθ
                        U 0 V = ei     θ      V U 0 = ei θ V U 0 = V U 0 .

Similarly, V 0 also commutes with both U and V . In fact, the von Neumann algebra
generated by U 0 and V 0 is the whole commutant of the algebra generated by the
interaction operators Ji [51]. In addition, it happens to be a factor of type II, and,
together, with its commutant they generate the whole of B(H).
Examples                                                                             85


   Therefore, this is an example of a correctable factor of type II. In fact, it is also
noiseless [23], in the sense that the correction channel can be taken to be the identity
channel, i.e. no active correction is needed. This happens simply because 1 was
assumed to be among the channel elements. Indeed, we saw that it implied that
the correction operators had to commute with the channel elements themselves.
Hence, if E is the channel, we have E ∗ (A) = E ∗ (1)A = A for all elements A of the
correctable algebra.
    Let us see how we can understand this “type II subsystem”, and how it resem-
bles, and differs from, the factors of type I with which we are familiar. If we were
dealing with a factor of type I containing the identity, then the Hilbert space would
take the form H = H1 ⊗ H2 , so that our algebra would be simply B(H1 ) ⊗ 1. In this
sense, a factor of type I defines a subsystem in the traditional sense. For instance,
consider H = L2 (R2 ) = L2 (R) ⊗ L2 (R). If ψ ∈ L2 (R2 ), the operators in the first
factor A = B(L2 (R)) ⊗ 1 are those which act only on the first component of ψ. For
instance, the first factor is generated by the operators (x̂ψ)(x, y) = xψ(x, y) and
               d
(p̂ψ)(x, y) = dx ψ(x, y). Note that here the set R2 on which the states are defined
can be understood to be the set of joint eigenvalues to the position operators in A
and A0 .
   Something similar happens for our factor of type II. Let A be the factor gen-
erated by U and V , and A0 its commutant, which is generated by U 0 and V 0 . Let
us see if we could see the elements of H as wavefunctions over the eigenvalues of
U and U 0 . First, note that the spectrum of both these operators is a circle (repre-
sented in the complex plane). These two operators being functions of the position
operator x̂, we may want to use the fact that the states of H can be represented
as wavefunction over the spectrum of x̂, i.e. elements of L2 (R). Indeed, we can
naturally convert an eigenvalue x of x̂ into the eigenvalues
                                                       ωx
                             a = eiωx x   and    b = ei θ x                      (4.10)

respectively of U and U 0 . In fact, this relationship is invertible. Indeed, if we are
given a and b, then only a single real number x will satisfy both these relations.
Indeed, suppose that we had two different real numbers x and x0 yielding the same
values of a and b. This would imply that they are related by x − x0 = 2πn/ω =
2πmθ/ω for two integers n and m. But this would imply θ = n/m, which is
not possible since we assumed θ to be irrational. This implies that for each state
ψ ∈ L2 (R), we can define the function

                                    ψ(a,
                                    e b) := ψ(x)

where x is the unique real number related to a and b via the Equations 4.10. Note
that this function ψe is defined only on the valid couples (a, b) related to some x ∈ R
via Equation 4.10. However, due to the irrationality of θ, these couples are dense
in the unit torus. We can therefore think of ψe as being defined almost everywhere
on the torus. We will indeed see that it can be interpreted, in a suitable sense, as
the wavefunction of a particle on a two-dimensional torus.

   The relation between the wavefunctions e   ψ(a, b) and the factors A and A0 is
given by the fact that they “act” respectively on the first and second arguments of
ψ respectively. Indeed, we have

                     ψ)(a, b) = (U ψ)(x) = eiωx x ψ(x) = a e
                   (U e                                   ψ(a, b)

which means that it acts just like the first component of the position of the particle.
Similarly,
                                                ωx
                 (U 0 ψ)(a,
                      e     b) = (U 0 ψ)(x) = ei θ x ψ(x) = b ψ(a,
                                                              e b)

The action of V is also easy to compute:

                 (V ψ)(a,
                    e     b) = (V ψ)(x) = ψ(x + ωp ) = ψ(a e2πiθ , b).

Hence, its effect is to rotate the first argument by the irrational angle θ. Similarly,
                                                                        1
               (V 0 ψ)(a,
                    e     b) = (V 0 ψ)(x) = ψ(x + ωp /θ) = ψ(a, b e2πi θ ).

   Although it looks like a particle on the torus, this system differs from it by the
nature of the normalized states. Indeed, the norm is
                          Z               Z
                   e  2             2
                  kψk = |ψ(x)| dx = |ψ(e      e iωx x , ei ωθx x )|2 dx.

What we have done is to take a standard particle in a one-dimensional space, and
wrap its space around a torus in a dense trajectory. If we view the particle as a
wavefunction ψe on the torus, its norm is an integral over this dense path. This
picture illustrates what the noise does. It disturbs only the first component of the
position of this particle, but not the second.

Decoherence

In this chapter we present three different models of decoherence. The third one
being, in a way, a combination of the first two. The first model (Section 5.2)
focuses on sharp observables, and is essentially based on our results related to
quantum error correction. It will serve as a guide for our intuition as to what
happens in the more general case involving unsharp observables. The second model
(Section 5.4) focuses on the system itself, ignoring the environment, and defines
the notion of an unsharp pointer observable. The third, more complete picture
(Section 5.5) considers the exchange of unsharp information between the system
and the environment. These results were presented in [4].
    Before we describe these models, we will come back on a point made in the
introduction, and define what we mean by a classical limit.


5.1     Nature of a classical limit
In nature, a classical system is a quantum system which happens to be in a context
where its behaviour can be successfully modeled by a classical theory. In principle,
neglecting computational difficulties, we ought to be able to model this system’s
behaviour using its full quantum description as well. This implies that we should
have in principle two different models which both describe the same physical system:
a quantum one, specified by an algebra of the form B(H), and a classical one, defined
by a commutative algebra L∞ (Ω). Since the quantum theory is more fundamental,
we should be able to translate every propositions of the classical model (i.e. every
effects) into a proposition in the underlying quantum language. This means that
we should have a map of the form

                                Γ∗ : L∞ (Ω) → B(H)

 which maps effects to effects. In addition, we may expect that a certain knowledge
about the quantum system should induce back a knowledge about the effective
classical propositions. We followed the same arguments in Section 2.1.2 when we

                                         87
88                                                                       Decoherence


introduced observables, which yielded the requirement that the map must be linear,
positive, unital and normal. The map Γ∗ is the dual of a channel Γ which maps
quantum states into classical states, just like an observable:

                                 Γ : Bt (H) → L1 (Ω).

    Hence, we expect that a classical limit, at the kinematical level, is given by
an observable. Our model of decoherence will take quite literally the idea that a
classical limit emerges from a “measurement” of the system by the environment.
In those terms, Γ is simply the observable being measured. We will refer to Γ as
the pointer observable.


5.1.1     Quantization
We know that Γ does not only define a map from classical effects to quantum effects,
but more generally a map from classical observables to quantum observables. Hence
it can be understood as defining, in a somewhat restricted sense, a quantization
procedure.
   In its most general form, a classical observable on a classical system defined by
the algebra L∞ (Ω) is a channel

                                π : L1 (Ω) → L1 (Ω0 ).

For instance, suppose that Ω = R2 is the phase-space for a single continuous vari-
able system (say a single particle in a one-dimensional space). Then the position
observable is the map which sends
                              R a probability distribution µ(q, p) over the phase-
        2                 0
space R to its marginal µ = µ(q, p) dp (see also Figure 2.1 for the action of the
dual map). But observables need not have only scalar values. For instance, there
is a phase-space observable, which is simply the identity map on L1 (Ω). Clearly
this “phase-space” observable always exists and has a special status: it gives full
information about the classical system.
   Remember (from Section 2.1.5) that a quantum channel E can be used indirectly
to map an observable X of the destination to the observable Y = X ◦E of the source.
The use of the dual map E ∗ is implicit in this expression. Dualizing the equation
we obtain Y ∗ = E ∗ ◦ X ∗ , which means Y ∗ (α) = E ∗ (X ∗ (α)) for each proposition α.
The expression Y = X ◦ E is convenient because it expresses in a straightforward
way that observing Y on the source is done by first applying the channel E and
then observing X.
   The pointer observable Γ maps quantum states into classical states, and can
therefore be used to map a classical observable π into a quantum observable X via
the equation X = π ◦ Γ. This means that measuring X amounts to first measuring
the observable represented by Γ, and then measuring the classical observable π on
the classical outcome of Γ. Equivalently we have X ∗ (α) = Γ∗ (π ∗ (α)). Of course,
Nature of a classical limit                                                         89


Γ itself is trivially the image of the special classical observable represented by the
identity on Ω: Γ = id ◦ Γ.
   If two classical observables are mapped to two quantum observables which do
not commute, then the classical observable representing their joint measurement is
mapped to an unsharp quantum observable. For instance, the classical observable
“id” mentioned above, which represents the joint measurement of all classical phase-
space variables, is mapped to Γ.
    Note that although Γ maps any classical observable to a quantum one, and every
quantum state to a classical one, it does not in general attain all classical states.
Indeed, the classical states that it can represent by quantum states will always
satisfy all the uncertainty relations. This is where the “limit ~ → 0” is involved. It
comes as a second step which consists in artificially removing these constraints on
states, hence assuming that the classical observations are too inaccurate to notice
them.
    Let us study this through a standard example. Consider the case of a single
free electromagnetic mode. This quantum system is characterized by the Hilbert
space H = L2 (R), and its classical limit by a phase-space Ω = R2 . We will denote
the points of phase space by pairs z = (p, q) where q will be called the “position”
and p the “momentum”.
   In many physically important situations, we know that the classical pure states
characterized by canonically conjugate pairs z = (q, p) ∈ Ω correspond to the
quantum coherent states |zi.
   Coherent states are pure states in the Hilbert space H = L2 (R) which form a
complete set, i.e.              Z
                                      |zihz| dz = 1

where
                                          dp dq
                                    dz :=       .
                                           2π~
These states however are not orthogonal and do not form a basis. For our purpose,
we need only say that they are generated by acting on a fiducial vector |ψ0 i with
elements of the group of “translations” in phase-space:

                                 |zihz| = Uz |0ih0|Uz∗

where, using the quantum operators qb and pb satisfying [b
                                                         q , pb] = i~, we defined
                                             i
                                  Uz := e− ~ (qbp+pbq) .

This group is a representation of the group of translations and “boosts” (i.e. trans-
lations in momentum). Note that this set of unitary operators does not close into
a group if we consider their action on vectors. Indeed, a non-trivial phase may
pop up due to the non-commutativity of pb and qb. However this phase is eliminated
when the action on mixed states is considered, which is all that matters here.

   In our language, this classical limit is defined by the observable Γ, which maps
a quantum state ρ to the classical state µ := Γ(ρ) defined by

                                        µ(z) = hz|ρ|zi.

The effect of the dual map Γ∗ is to send the classical effect α ∈ L∞ (Ω) to the
quantum effect                     Z
                                 Γ∗ (α) =        α(z)|zihz|dz.
                                             Ω
We can now play with this map and see how it transforms observables or states.
   For instance consider the classical position observable Q, Rwhich maps a phase-
space probability distribution µ(q, p) to its marginal µ(p) = µ(q, p)dp. Its quan-
tum version, Q ◦ Γ, maps a quantum state ρ to the marginal of the distribution
µ(q, p) = hq, p|ρ|q, pi. Its dual , which operates on effects α ∈ L∞ (R), is given by

                                   = α(q)        |p, qihp, q|       dq
                                                              2π~

                                   = α(q)Qq dq

where we have defined the “effect density”
                                   Z
                                                dp

These operators are, in fact, simple functions of the sharp position operator qb.
Indeed, using the position representation, we have

sented by qb. In fact, it is likely that the set of operators Qq for all q generate the
algebra generated by qb, which essentially identifies qb. Of course the same is true
for the quantization P ◦ Γ of the classical momentum observable P .
    More generally, consider a sharp real classical observable πf represented by a
real (possibly unbounded) function f on the phase-space R2 . The channel πf is
defined by
                               (πf∗ (α))(z) = α(f (z))
where α is an effect in L∞ (R). When composed with Γ∗ it becomes the unsharp
quantum observable Xf with dual
                                                    Z
                         Xf∗ (α) = Γ∗ (πf∗ (α)) =       α(f (z)) |zihz| dz.

It is clear that any classical observable can be given a quantum version without
any “ordering ambiguity”.
    Of course, calling this “quantization” is far from being fair, given that we only
reinterpreted a known quantum theory with a known classical limit. However,
the fact that most classical observables, even though they have no sharp quantum
representation, must have an unsharp one is an important point to make. Also,
we point out that when only the classical description of a system is known, there
is a priori no reason to think that certain specific observables will have a sharp
representation in the quantum theory. That is, unless one is guided by some specific
experimental results involving, for instance, the quantization of the value of certain
observable, or some uncertainty relations. Such results are lacking in the case of
general relativity.
    In addition, we note that, beside the choice of the dimension of our Hilbert
space, or the type of our von Neumann algebra, the map Γ really defines the
quantum theory, given that it is what makes the link between abstract quantum
observables, which are nothing more than pure mathematical objects, and concrete
classical observable that we know how to measure and interpret. As we showed,
specifying Γ amounts to giving the quantization of all observables. In fact Γ itself
is the quantization of the phase-space observable, which represents all that there is
to know about the classical theory, apart from the dynamics.
   In the rest of this chapter we will attempt to give a realistic picture of the
emergence of a classical limit defined by an observable Γ. The hope being that this
provides clues as to how, given the classical theory and its environment, one may
attempt to guess the nature of the map Γ which essentially defines the quantum
theory.

5.2     Sharp decoherence
The results presented in Chapter 3 give us a thorough understanding of the “sharp
information” preserved by a quantum channel, i.e. the information represented by
sharp observables. We will now make use of these results to generalize the simple
example of decoherence discussed in the introduction, in Section 1.3. Our analysis
will be based essentially on the results presented in Section 3.3.
    We have seen that, if we are given a quantum channel E which describes the
evolution of an open quantum system, there is a complementary channel Ec which
describes the flow of information to the environment. The complementary channel
is unique up to a unitary transformation of the environment. We have then shown
that the sharp observables preserved by E are precisely those which commute with
all the effects (sharp and unsharp) preserved by Ec . It follows that the sharp
observables preserved by both channels must all commute with each other and
therefore form a commutative algebra C. Concretely, C is the intersection of the
algebras A and Ac correctable respectively for E and Ec : C := A ∩ Ac . Since it
is commutative, it characterizes classical information. This shows that the only
sharp information which has been duplicated is classical. This can be understood
as a version of the no-cloning theorem, with the addition that it tells us precisely
which observable of the system represents the classical information which has been
duplicated, namely the observable Γ which generates the commutative algebra C.
Note that Γ is defined up to a measure-preserving bijective transformation of its
spectrum, i.e. the phase-space.
    One possible interpretation is the following. Suppose that E represents the time
evolution of the system of interest. The algebra Ac represents properties of the
system prior to the interaction. However, the part of Ac which is also preserved in
the system, namely C, also represents properties that the system possesses after the
interaction. Therefore C represents the information gathered by the environment
and which has predictive power about the future state of the system. In the next
section we will show that each observable in C in fact implies the existence of
correlations between the system and the environment after the interaction.


5.2.1    Correlations
Consider a “duplicated” sharp discrete observable X with effects Xi2 = Xi ∈ C.
Since this observable is preserved by both E and Ec , there exists an observable Y of
the system and an observable Z of the environment which are such that Xi = E ∗ (Yi ),
Xi = Ec∗ (Zi ) for all i. Remember that this means that the information about the
observable X of the initial state of the system is represented by the observable Y of
the system after the interaction, and also by the observable Z of the environment
after the interaction. Hence the piece of information that it represents became
redundant. We will show that the observables Y and Z are indeed correlated, and
therefore also contain information about each other.
Sharp decoherence                                                                      93


   We can “purify” the channel E with the isometry V such that
                              Xi = E ∗ (Yi ) = V ∗ (Yi ⊗ 1)V                        (5.1)
and
                             Xi = Ec∗ (Zi ) = V ∗ (1 ⊗ Zi )V.                       (5.2)
where V = U (1 ⊗ |ψi), with the unitary operator U representing the joint evolu-
tion of the two interacting systems, and |ψi the initial state of the environment
(see Figure 3.1). These expressions are just the Heisenberg picture version of the
relations E(ρ) = Trenv (U (ρ ⊗ |ψihψ|)U ∗ ) and Ec (ρ) = Trsys (U (ρ ⊗ |ψihψ|)U ∗ ), where
Trenv is the partial trace over the environment, and Trsys the partial trace over the
system.
    Consider the first equation. If we multiply the left hand side by Xi⊥ on both
sides, we obtain
                              0 = Xi⊥ V ∗ (Yi ⊗ 1)V Xi⊥ .
Since the √
          right hand side is a positive operator,√its square root must also be zero,
i.e. 0 = ( Yi ⊗ 1)V Xi⊥ or, by multiplying by ( Yi ⊗ 1) on the left, and recalling
that Xi⊥ = 1 − Xi ,
                              (Yi ⊗ 1)V (1 − Xi ) = 0.                         (5.3)
Similarly we have Xi⊥ = (1−Xi ) = V ∗ ((1−Yi )⊗1)V , which, by the same argument,
implies
                            ((1 − Yi ) ⊗ 1)V Xi = 0.                         (5.4)
Combining Equations 5.3 and 5.4, we obtain
                                   (Yi ⊗ 1)V = V Xi .
Applying the same reasoning to Equation 5.2 yields
                                   (1 ⊗ Zi )V = V Xi .
Combing the two yields
                           (Yi ⊗ Zj )V = V Xi Xj = δij V Xi ,
from which we have
                                V ∗ (Yi ⊗ Zj )V = δij Xi .                          (5.5)
This last equation is the result that we were seeking: it means that Y and Z are
entirely correlated. Indeed, for any state ρ of the system,
               Tr(V ρV ∗ (Yi ⊗ Zj )) = Tr(ρV ∗ (Yi ⊗ Zj )V ) = δij Tr(ρXi )
is the joint probability characterizing the joint measurement of Y and Z after
the interaction, and, as we can see thank to the Kronecker delta, the probability
that both measurements yield different outcomes is zero. It is straightforward to
generalize this analysis to the case of continuous observables. We would then obtain
that
                  V ∗ (Y ∗ (α) ⊗ Z ∗ (β))V = X ∗ (α)X ∗ (β) = X ∗ (αβ).
Hence, for all states ρ,
                     Tr(V ρV ∗ (Y ∗ (α) ⊗ Z ∗ (β))) = Tr(ρX ∗ (αβ)).

5.2.2    Predictability and objectivity
These results show that the only sharp information that the environment learns
about system, and which has any predictive power with respect to the outcome
of some sharp measurement on the system after the interaction is classical. This
classical information can be characterized by a single observable Γ: the pointer
observable (defined up to a measure-preserving bijective transformation of phase-
space). Hence, in any interaction, some classical degrees of freedom of a quantum
system are uniquely selected by the requirement that their information be sent to
the environment, and at the same time, be useful to predict properties of the system
after the interaction. From the point of view of an experimentalist who observes
the system indirectly by gathering information from the environment, the effective
classical system represented by Γ evolves deterministically. The other degrees of
freedom of the system can be simply ignored in this picture.
    We note that our use of the notion of preserved, or correctable, information
allows for the information represented by the pointer state to have in principle any
non-trivial evolution during the process of decoherence. Indeed, the fact that the
information is preserved does not mean that it does not evolve.
    This provides a possible model of the process of decoherence. The interesting
aspect of this picture is that it does not require any assumption about the interac-
tion. This makes it universal. Nevertheless this model is limited by the fact that Γ
is sharp, and therefore cannot account for most classical limits. The next sections
will address this problem.
    There is another possible way of interpreting the same technical results. First,
we note that the two channels that we considered need not be the exact complement
of each other. Indeed, the results hold if the second channel considered only maps
the system to a subsystem of the environment. Consider the channel F defined by

                            F ∗ (A) := V ∗ (1 ⊗ A ⊗ 1)V

where the second and third tensor factors correspond to two subsystems of the
environment. Clearly, by comparing with Equation 5.2, we have

                                F ∗ (A) = Ec∗ (A ⊗ 1)

which implies that all the information preserved by F is also preserved by Ec .
Hence it is still true that the sharp observables preserved by both F and E form a
commutative algebra. In fact this is true of any couple of channels from the system
to two different subsystems, be it part of the future state of the system or of the
environment.
   Given this fact, let us consider two channels F1 and F2 from the system to
two different subsystems of the environment. The information about the system
preserved by both observables is classical and characterized by a single observable
Γ of the system. Therefore, a classical limit is selected simply by the condition
Sharp decoherence                                                                      95


that it be represented redundantly in the environment. As stressed by Ollivier et
al. [10, 14] (see also [11]), redundancy of representation is an important aspect
of classical information, because it guarantees the objectivity of this information.
Indeed, it allows two different observers to indirectly obtain the same information
about the system, without disturbing each other’s observation in any way. This
slightly different picture of the process of decoherence has the advantage of allowing
for the emergence of a classical system subject to noise. Indeed, the requirement
of redundancy uniquely selects a classical limit without requiring the evolution of
the effective classical system to be deterministic. This will be analyzed in greater
details for the more general model introduced in Section 5.5. For now, let us
just mention that this particular model reproduces the main result of [10], namely
the selection of a sharp pointer observable through the requirement that it be
represented redundantly in the environment. However our notion of redundancy is
stronger because it does not only involves correlations at a given time, but it also
requires that this information represents a property that the system possessed at
an earlier time.


5.2.3     Examples
Let us show how this model reduces to the simple example mentioned in the intro-
duction. We considered the channel E defined by
                                    X
                             E(ρ) =     |iihi|ρ|iihi|
                                             i

where the vectors |ii form an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space H. The cor-
rectable algebra A for this channel is the commutant of the algebra generated by the
operators |iihi|jihj| = δij |iihi|. These operators simply generate the commutative
algebras of operators diagonal in the basis |ii. This algebra is its own commutant,
hence we see that the correctable algebra is already commutative, and characterized
by the discrete sharp observable Γ with elements Γi = |iihi|.
   In order to find the complementary channel, note that if V is an isometry
resulting from the dilation of E, then |iihi| = (1 ⊗ hφi |)V , for some basis |φi i of the
environment (Equation 3.12). This implies that the elements of the complementary
channel are
                                    X
                 Fi = (hi| ⊗ 1)V =      (hi| ⊗ |φj ihφj |)V
                                         j
                        X                           X
                    =       |φj i(hi| ⊗ hφj |)V =           |φj ihi|(1 ⊗ hφj |)V
                        j                               j
                        X
                    =       |φj ihi|jihj| = |φi ihi|.
                        j

Therefore the sharp information preserved by the complementary channel is char-
acterized by the commutant the operators Fi∗ Fj = |iihφi |φj ihj| = δij |iihi|, which
96                                                                         Decoherence


is identical to the correctable algebra for E. Hence in this case A = Ac , so that
C = A ∩ Ac = A. This shows that the environment gathers information precisely
about the observable Γ which is preserved in the system. In this situation, the
eigenstates |ii of Γ are the pointer states usually referred to in the literature [5, 9].
     For a slightly more general example, consider the channel
                                       X
                                E(ρ) =     U Pi ρPi U ∗                            (5.6)
                                           i

for a unitary operator U and an complete family of orthogonal projectors Pi . The
correctable algebra is given be the commutant of the operators Pi U ∗ U Pj = Pi Pj =
δij Pi . This algebra is composed of all matrices which are block-diagonal in terms
of the subspaces defined by the projectors Pi . Hence
                                         M
                                   A≈       Mnk                                 (5.7)
                                               i

where nk = Tr(Pk ). If any of the dimension nk is larger than 1, this algebra contains
quantum information.
   In order to compute the elements of the complementary channel, we will use a
basis {|ψji i}ij of the system which is an aggregate    P of basis of the complementary
subspaces defined by the projectors Pi , i.e. Pi = j |ψji ihψji |. The elements of the
complementary channel then are, for some basis |φi i of the environment,
                               X
                         Fij =    |φk i(hψji |U ∗ )U Pk = |φi ihψji |.             (5.8)
                                k

Therefore, the algebra correctable for the complementary channel is the commutant
of the operators
                       Fij∗ Fkl = |ψji ihφi |φk ihψlk | = δik |ψji ihψli |.
These operators precisely span A. Therefore Ac = A0 , which implies that the
intersection of A and Ac is the whole center of A:

                                    C = A ∩ Ac = Z(A)

which is the commutative algebra of operators of the form
                                      X
                                 A=       λ i Pi                                   (5.9)
                                               n

for any λi ∈ C. Hence the sharp information preserved in the system and transmit-
ted to the environment is characterized by the discrete pointer observable Γ with
elements Γi = Pi .
    Note that in this case, the concept of pointer state is not adapted to a de-
scription of the situation. Instead, we have a phenomenon of environment-induced
superselection rules (einselection) [52]. Here Γ is the superselection charge.
Sharp decoherence                                                                      97


    We see that the unitary evolution characterized by the operator U plays no role
in this analysis. This is because it does not remove or add any information to the
system. This demonstrates an important feature of our framework, which is that
it automatically identifies the original nature of the preserved information while
neglecting any reversible change in its representation.
   We can also look at how the decoherence gradually sets in, when time is intro-
duced in the previous example. Consider the Hamiltonian

                                         H =A⊗B
            PN
where A := i=1 λi Pi with λi = Ti , and B generates cyclic shifts in the basis |φi i,
i = 0, . . . , N of the environment, i.e.

                             e−ıB |φi i = |φ(i+1 mod N ) i.
                                               √
Note that we will be using the symbol ı = −1 for notational convenience. The
eigenstates
    P ıωkjof B are the discrete     Fourier transforms of the basis, namely |ji =
√1                           2π
  N   k e   |φk i, where ω = N
                                . The  unitary operator for an interval of time t is
                                                   P

                               =     Pi ⊗ e−ıtλi B
                                     i

Note that
                                 X                       1 X −ıtλi ωj

Therefore, if the initial state of the environment is |0i, the resulting isometry is

In particular, for t = λ11 = T , we have
                              X                         Xh 1 X                   i

Hence at time T we recover the channel defined in Equation 5.6 with U = 1.
    Let us now study what happens before time T . At time t < T , the algebra
of sharp observables preserved in the system is given by the commutant of the
operators
                                                    1 X −ıω(k−k0 )tλi

                                                    N i

which is the algebra A defined in Equation 5.7. Indeed, every single one of these
operators for k 6= k 0 generates the algebra spanned by the projectors Pi , of which A
is the commutant. To see this it suffices to note that for fixed k 6= k 0 , the coefficients
         0
e−ıω(k−k )tλi are distinct for all i. This shows that the sharp information preserved in
the system at all time is the same. However, as we will see, the unsharp preserved
information gets degraded until only the sharp preserved information is left.
   In order to obtain the elements of the complementary channels, we choose as
                i
          P |ψij i ofi the system which is compatible with the projectors Pi , i.e. so

and only if t(λi −λi0 ) is an integer. Since λi −λi0 = T (i−i ), this cannot happen if t/T
is irrational. Otherwise, if t/T = p/q for some integers p and q < N , then γii0 = 0
when i − i0 = q. If this happens, we are missing the matrix elements of the form
|ψji ihψji−q                                   ∗                          0      0

From the previous argument, each element in this sum is always present in our
span, unless t/T is an integer. Therefore, when t < T , there is no non-trivial sharp
observable commuting with all the operators of the form Fij∗ (t)Fi0 j 0 (t), and hence
no non-trivial sharp observable flowing to the environment.
    However there are non-trivial unsharp observables flowing to the environment.
In fact, we can see how one of these preserved unsharp observable becomes sharper
with time until it equals one of the projectors Pi . Indeed, let us find an observable
of the environment that one should measure at time T in order to reproduce the
statistics of the observable with elements Pi . At time T the elements of the com-
plementary channel are given by Equation 5.8. Using these, one can check that the
sharp observable with elements Qk := |φk ihφk | does the job. Indeed,
                           X                                  X
               Ec∗ (Qk ) =   |ψji ihφi |φk ihφk |φi ihψji | =   |ψjk ihψjk | = Pk .

Measuring the same observable of the environment at an earlier time t yields infor-
mation about the observable of the system with elements

As t → T , γim converges to δim , which implies that Am converges to Pm .


5.3      Classical set of observables
The picture presented in the previous section is fundamentally tied to sharp observ-
ables, and cannot describe the emergence of a classical limit characterized by an
unsharp observable. In particular this means that it cannot describe the emergence
of a non-trivial phase-space. In Section 5.5 we will see that this picture can in fact
be generalized to unsharp pointer observables. However it will be instructive to first
consider a simpler generalization. For the moment we will ignore the environment,
and attempt to understand what it means for a channel to destroy any information
but that represented by an unsharp observable.
100                                                                     Decoherence


   In the previous section, we used the fact that the set of preserved sharp observ-
ables form a sub-algebra, and that, when this algebra is commutative, it represents
an effective classical system. This idea does not work with unsharp observables,
which are not associated with any algebra. Therefore we need to generalize what
we mean by a classical set of observables.

    We want to understand when the set of observables preserved by a channel, or
even any set of observables, can be said to characterize classical information. We
have already defined classical information as that represented by a physical system
whose set of effects belong to a commutative algebra. Hence, it is a priori natural
to think of a classical set of quantum observables as that which is characterized
by a commutative sub-algebra of the quantum algebra. However, we have seen in
Section 5.1, that there exists much more general ways for a classical system to be
represented by a quantum system. In general, the representation can be given by
a channel mapping quantum states into classical states, or equivalently by its dual
which translates classical effects into quantum effects. This map, which is simply
an observable, does not in general preserve the full structure of the commutative
algebra. Note that when it does, i.e. when it represents a sharp observable, it
singles out a commutative sub-algebra of the quantum algebra. If however it is
not a homomorphism, then it may map sharp observables into unsharp ones, and
commutative pairs of observables into non-commutative ones, which implies a cer-
tain loss of information. However this loss of information allows for fundamentally
different quantum representations of a classical system, as seen in Section 5.1.

   Consider an observable
                                Γ : Bt (H) → L1 (Ω)

which defines how our quantum system with Hilbert space H imperfectly represents
the classical system with phase-space Ω. This maps also represents every observ-
ables of the classical system by an observable of the quantum system. Indeed,
consider a classical observable

                                π : L1 (Ω) → L1 (Ω0 )

which is also simply a stochastic map between the two classical systems Ω and Ω0 .
This observable is represented by the quantum observable

                                    X = π ◦ Γ.

Measuring X amounts to first measuring Γ, and then measuring π on the classical
system Ω representing the outcome of the quantum measurement.

  Therefore, to the classical limit Γ is associated the set of observable of the form
X = π ◦ Γ, for all classical observables π. Note that this is simply the set PΓ of
Classical set of observables                                                            101


observables preserved by Γ.

                                             Γ-
                                  Bt (H)            L1 (Ω)

                                                       π
                                           X
                                                  -
                                                       ?
                                                  L1 (Ω0 )

   We will also say that these observables are coarse-grainings of Γ since they
amount to measuring Γ and then forgetting about some aspects of the classical
result by applying the stochastic map π. In this sense, each of these observables
represent less information than Γ.
    We will take this to be the prototype of a classical set of observable. In fact we
will say that a set of observable is classical if it belongs to such a set, i.e. if they
are all coarse-grainings of a single observable Γ.
Definition 5.1. We say of a set O of observables that it is classical if there is an
observable Γ and a family of stochastic maps πX , X ∈ O such that

                               X = πX ◦ Γ for all X ∈ O.

This is equivalent to saying that the observables X ∈ O are all preserved by Γ, i.e.

                                         O ⊆ PΓ .

    Note that it would be tempting to characterize this set of observables by a set of
effects, i.e. the set of coarse-grainings of Γ which take value in the set Ω0 = {0, 1}.
But the counter-example used in Section 3.1 shows that this is not possible.
    As an example, consider the set of observables defined by a commutative sub-
algebra A ⊆ Bt (H). In this case Γ can be chosen to be any sharp observable whose
spectral projectors generate the commutative sub-algebra A. More concisely, Γ can
be represented by a self-adjoint operator Γ,b whose bounded functions generate A. If
Γ takes value in ΩΓ , i.e. Γ : A∗ → L1 (ΩΓ ), then the dual map Γ∗ is a homomorphism
of L∞ (ΩΓ ) onto A. This means than a sharp observable X represented by a self-
adjoint operator X b ∈ A is a coarse-graining of Γ in the following way. We know that
there is a real function f such that X  b = f (Γ).
                                                b The function f is a mapping from
the spectrum ΩΓ of Γ to that of X. This means that the effects X ∗ (χω ) of X satisfy
X ∗ (α) = Γ∗ (α◦f ). We then define the stochastic map π by π ∗ (α)(x) := α(f (x)) for
all x ∈ ΩΓ , so that we have X ∗ (α) = Γ∗ (α ◦ f ) = Γ∗ (π ∗ (α)) for all α, i.e. X = π ◦ Γ.
    For instance, if Γ is sharp and discrete with elements Γ2i = Γi , then all the
operators in the algebra Γ that it generates are represented by self-adjoint operators
of the form X b = P
                      i∈ΩΓ λi Γi . It is then clear that measuring Γ is as good as
measuring the observable represented by X.   b All that one has to do to simulate a
102                                                                      Decoherence


measurement of X    b is to forget the distinction between the outcomes i and j in the
case that λi = λj , an operation which can be represented by the stochastic matrix
π defined as follow. Let Ω be the set of distinct values taken by the coefficients λi
for all i, which is the spectrum of bX. The stochastic matrix π is defined by πiλi = 1
for all i ∈ ΩΓ and 0 for all other components.


5.3.1     Non-contextuality
Our definition of a classical set of observable is further justified by that fact that
they represent an effective theory which can be simulated by a non-contextual
hidden variable model, in the sense defined in [53].
    Suppose that we have a physical system defined by a set of observables O
and a set of states S. A non-contextual hidden variable model associates to each
observable X ∈ O a classical observable πX , and, to each state ρ ∈ S, a classical
states µρ , in such a way that, when combined, these classical states and observables
yield the same probability distributions as the quantum states and observables they
represent.
   The idea is that the model would be contextual with respect to preparations if
the classical state was a function not only of ρ but also of the observable X, which
would mean that the particular state we must choose depends on the particular
experiment that we are going to perform. Correspondingly, it would be contextual
with respect to measurements if the classical observable to choose depended on the
quantum state.
    It is known that quantum theory cannot be given a non-contextual model. How-
ever, a classical set of quantum observables can. Indeed, this is precisely what the
observable Γ which characterizes our classical set does. Indeed, it maps any quan-
tum state ρ to a probability distribution µρ = Γ(ρ) ∈ L1 (Ω). In addition, each
observable X of the classical set is associated with a classical observable πX which
is such that X = πX ◦ Γ. This relation implies that the probability distribution
X(ρ) is equal to one given by the effective classical theory, i.e. πX (µρ ). Indeed,

                            πX (µρ ) = πX (Γ(ρ)) = X(ρ).


5.3.2     Functional coexistence
There exists a concept of coexistence between POVMs [54] which generalizes the
notion of commutativity for PVMs.
    Remember that an observable X defines a map X ∗ from classical effects to
quantum effects. When this map is restricted to sharp classical effects, which are
all of the form χω for some subset ω ⊆ Ω of the phase-space Ω, then it defines a
POVM, which is a map from subsets ω to quantum effects. The effects of the form
X ∗ (χω ) can therefore be said to be in the range of the POVM. A set of POVMs
Decoherent channels                                                              103


is called coexistent if the union of their range are all within the range of a single
POVM. To show that the observables in our “classical” set are coexistent, we first
need to prove a Lemma. We say that an observable X is a marginal of
                   Y : Bt (H) → L1 (Ω1 ) ⊗ L1 (Ω2 ) = L1 (Ω1 × Ω2 )
if X ∗ (α) = Y ∗ (α ⊗ 1), which means that measuring X amounts to measuring Y
and then discarding the Ω2 component of the result. The following then is true:
Lemma 5.1. Observables in a classical set are all marginals of a single observable.

Proof. Suppose that we have a set of observables O, which are all coarse-grainings
of Γ : B(H) → L1 (Ω). For clarity, we will label the observables in O by a set Σ,
i.e. O = {Xσ | σ ∈ Σ}. For all σ ∈ Σ there exists a channel πσ : L1 (Ω) → L1 (Ωσ ),
where Ωσ is the set of values of Xσ , such that Xσ = πσ ◦ Γ. Consider the channel
                                        O                Y
                      copy : L1 (Ω) →       L1 (Ω) = L1 ( Ω)
                                          Σ              Σ
                      N
defined by copy(µ) = Σ µ. This channel produces as many copies of the state of
the classical system Ω as there are elements in the set Σ. We use this to define the
new observable                      O 
                              Γ
                              e :=      πσ ◦ copy ◦ Γ
                                    σ∈Σ

which amounts to measuring Γ, then duplicating the output as many times as there
are elements in Σ, and finally applying πσ to the σ’s copy. It is then clear that
each observable Xσ is a marginal of Γ,
                                    e namely it amounts to measuring Γe and then
discarding all but the σ’s component of the outcome.
    This almost directly shows that all coarse-grainings of a single observable Γ
are coexistent. Indeed, using the same objects as in Q   the above proof, we have
  ∗          ∗
           e               e contains all the elements of Σ Ω which have their σ’s
Xσ (χω ) = Γ (χωe ), where ω
component inside ω.
    In fact, this shows that the coarse-grainings of Γ are more than just coexistent.
They are alsoQfunctionally coexistent, which means that ω    e is related to ω by a
function f : Σ Ω → Ω, i.e. ω     e = f −1 (ω). Here the function is f (x) = xσ , and
f −1 (ω) denotes the pre-image of ω under f . In fact, it is also clearly true that
functionally coexistent observables form a classical set. Therefore we have the
following:
Proposition 5.2. Observables form a classical set if and only if they are function-
ally coexistent.


5.4     Decoherent channels
Equipped with our definition of a classical set of observables, we can now define a
fully decoherent channel E as one whose preserved set of observables PE is classical,
104                                                                      Decoherence


i.e.
                                         PE ⊆ PΓ
for some observable Γ. The observable Γ then is the pointer observable character-
izing the decoherence process.

Definition 5.2. A channel E is said to be fully decoherent in terms of the pointer
observable Γ if all its preserved observables are coarse-grainings of Γ.

   It may be convenient to visualize this definition by combining the commutative
diagrams which state that X is preserved by both E and Γ:

                                             E-
                               Bt (H1 )            Bt (H2 )

                                 Γ                   Y
                                           X
                                                   -
                                     ?                 ?
                                L1 (Ω)           - L1 (Ω0 )
                                             π

This can be read as follows. Imagine that the channel E and the classical limit
Γ are given, and disregard the diagonal X. The condition for Γ to be a pointer
observable selected by E is that for every observable Y , π exists to complete the
square.
    In general, if PE 6= PΓ , the pointer observable Γ is not unique. For instance, it
could be that the channel preserves no information at all, which would mean that
the preserved observables are only those whose effects are proportional to the iden-
tity. In this case, absolutely any observable could serve as the pointer observable,
according to the above definition. The idea is that in this case any observable would
yield a consistent classical interpretation of this information, albeit admitting only
maximally mixed quantum states. In general, the description based on a pointer
observable Γ contains more information than what has actually been preserved by
the channel. Therefore, the arbitrariness in the choice of the pointer observable cor-
responds to the arbitrariness of the added information in the classical description.
In fact we may expect that, in realistic systems, the differences between various
choices of the pointer observable vanish when the accuracy with which the observer
can resolve the classical observables is small compared to ~.


5.4.1     Example: entanglement-breaking channels

As an example, consider all channels with rank-one elements, i.e. of the form
                                     X
                           E(ρ) =         λi |ψi ihφi |ρ|φi ihψi |
                                     i
Decoherent channels                                                                   105


where the states |ψi i and |φi i are arbitrary, apart from the condition that E ∗ (1) = 1,
which implies that                  X
                                        λi |φi ihφi | = 1.
                                      i

This is the general form of the entanglement-breaking channels in finite-dimensions
[55]. Channels of this form are fully decoherent, with discrete pointer observable Γ
defined by its elements
                                   Γi = λi |φi ihφi |.
Indeed, an observable X preserved by E has the form
                                X
                      X ∗ (α) =    λi |φi ihψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi ihφi |
                                      i

for some observable Y . Therefore,
                              X
                    X ∗ (α) =    hψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi i Γi = Γ∗ (π ∗ (α))
                                  i

where the classical channel π is defined by

                                π ∗ (α)i = hψi |Y ∗ (α)|ψi i.

To see that this map π is a valid channel, note first that it is manifestly positive
and unital. In addition, it is the dual of the map
                                          X
                              π(µ)i = Y (     µi |ψi ihψi |)
                                              i

on states, and is therefore normal. Note that such channels were already studied in
Section 3.4. In particular, the sets of effects represented in Figure 3.2 are examples
of classical sets.
    If the sum is replaced by an integral over a continuous set of states, the resulting
channel has the same properties. An example of such a channel is given in Section
5.4.3 below.


5.4.2     Covariant decoherent channels

The above considerations about the freedom in the choice of the pointer observable
Γ can be made more concrete in the case where the channel E is covariant with
respect to a unitary representation U : g ∈ G → Ug of a compact Lie group G. The
channel E is said to be covariant with respect to this group if there exists another
unitary representation V : g → Vg which is such that, for all g ∈ G,

                                E(Ug ρUg∗ ) = Vg E(ρ)Vg∗ .
106                                                                                    Decoherence


    Now suppose that this channel is fully decoherent, in the above sense, in terms
of some pointer observable
                              Γ0 : Bt (H) → L1 (Ω)
This means that for all observables X there exists a classical observable πX such
that for all effects α,
                                                   ∗
                             E ∗ (X ∗ (α)) = Γ∗0 (πX (α))
but then we also have, for all g ∈ G,

            E ∗ (X ∗ (α)) = E ∗ (Vg∗ Vg X ∗ (α)Vg∗ Vg ) = Ug∗ E ∗ (Vg X ∗ (α)Vg∗ )Ug
                                                                                            (5.10)
                         = Ug∗ Γ∗ (πgX
                                    ∗
                                       (α))Ug

where, by gX we mean the observable defined by

                                (gX)∗ (α) := Vg X ∗ (α)Vg∗

Equation 5.10 means that the preserved observables are not only coarse-grainings
of Γ, but are also coarse-grainings of any observable of the form

                                   Γ∗g (α) := Ug∗ Γ∗0 (α)Ug .

This shows an example of ambiguity in the choice of the pointer observable. How-
ever, it may be that the pointer observable Γ is such that Γg is equivalent to Γ up
to a relabelling of its values Ω. This would mean that Γ itself is covariant with
respect to G in the sense that there exists an action λ of G on Ω which is such
that Γg (α) = Γ0 (α ◦ λg ). In fact we can always build a pointer observable Γ which
is covariant in this way. It is, in a sense, and average of each Γg over the Haar
measure. More precisely, we define Γ by
                                Z              Z
                       ∗
                     Γ (α) := Γg (αg ) dg = Ug∗ Γ∗0 (αg )Ug dg.
                                    ∗



where α ∈ L∞ (G) ⊗ L∞ (Ω), αg (x) := α(g,
                                        R x) for all x ∈ Ω. The invariant Haar
measure dg on G is normalized such that dg = 1. This observable is covariant for
the group G with respect to the action λ on G × Ω defined by the right-action

                                   λh (g, x) := (gh−1 , x)

for all h ∈ G and x ∈ Ω. Indeed, we have
                           Z                      Z
               ∗ ∗
              Uh Γ (α)Uh = Ugh Γ0 (αg )Ugh dg = Ug∗ Γ∗0 (αgh−1 )Ug dg
                               ∗ ∗

                           Z
                         = Ug∗ Γ∗0 (αg ◦ λh )Ug dg = Γ(α ◦ λh ).

We still have to show that, indeed, all observables preserved by E are coarse-
grainings of Γ, so that it can serve as a pointer observable. Given an observable X

                                         = Γ (Π∗X (α))
where we have defined the classical observable
                            ΠX : L1 (G) ⊗ L1 (Ω) → L1 (ΩX )
by
                                Π∗X (α)(g, x) := πgX

5.4.3    Example: coherent states
Let us give an example of a channel decoherent in terms of an unsharp pointer
observable. We will use the setting of a Hilbert space H which contains coherent
states |zi = |q, pi generated from a fiducial vector |ψ0 i, as in Section 5.1.1. We
consider the channel E defined by
                                    Z
                             E(ρ) = |zihz|ρ|zihz|dz                            (5.11)

or                                           Z
                                 ∗
                                E (A) =          |zihz|A|zihz|dz.

This channel is of the form of the class of examples studied in Section 3.4, apart
from the fact that the sum has been replaced by an integral. An observable X
which is preserved by this channel is of the form
                                  Z
                         X (α) = |zihz|Y ∗ (α)|zihz|dz.
                            ∗



for some observable Y . It is immediately clear that this observable is a coarse-
graining of the coherent-state observable Γ studied in Section 5.1.1. Indeed, re-
member that                          Z
                              ∗
                             Γ (α) = α(z)|zihz|dz.

Hence, we have
                        Z                                     Z
                 ∗                   ∗
              X (α) =       hz|Y (α)|zi|zihz|dz =                 (π ∗ (α))(z) |zihz|dz

                      = Γ∗ (π ∗ (α)).
where we have defined the stochastic map π by
                                 π ∗ (α)(z) = hz|Y ∗ (α)|zi.
108                                                                         Decoherence


Note that π ∗ is positive and unital. In addition it is normal, because it is the dual
of                                      Z
                             π(µ) = Y ( µ(z)|zihz|dz)
                                         R
which is well-defined
                   P given thatR ρ := µ(z)|zihz|dz is trace-class. Indeed, for a
basis |ii, we have i hi|ρ|ii = µ(z) dz = 1.
    Therefore we have in this example that PE ⊆ PΓ . However, we do not have
equality between these sets. Indeed, Γ itself is not preserved by the channel. In-
stead, the closest we can get is an observable Γ               e := Γ ◦ E which, more
                                                 e of the form Γ
explicitly, has the form
                                      Z
                 Γ (α) = E (Γ (α)) = α(z) |zihz|z 0 ihz 0 |zihz| dz dz 0
                 e ∗       ∗  ∗

                         Z
                       = α(z) |hz|z 0 i|2 |zihz| dz dz 0 .

This observable can be understood as an approximate form of the observable Γ.
For instance, if the fiducial state |ψ0 i that we used to define the coherent states is
a Gaussian then so is |hz|z 0 i|2 , which shows that if α(z) is peaked around z, then
e∗ (α) is given by a Gaussian smearing of coherent states around z, instead of the
Γ
coherent state |zihz| itself. However, Γ   e itself is not sufficient to characterize PE .
Indeed, PeΓ does not contain the whole of PE .
    Note that this channel E is clearly covariant with respect to the group of trans-
lations and boosts in phase-space, which was used to generate the coherent states.
However, we cannot use this fact to generate other pointer states from Γ, given
that Γ is already covariant with respect to this group.
     In conclusion, the channel defined by Equation 5.11 yields an example of how a
realistic classical limit can emerge dynamically from decoherence. We note that the
emergence of phase-space through decoherence has been studied before [15, 9], how-
ever this is the first model which allows in principle for the possibility of a derivation
of the structure of the emergent phase-space. Indeed, all other approaches attempt
to show that a given classical description is consistent, without excluding other
possible classical descriptions. Although our description may also have a certain
ambiguity in the choice of the pointer observable Γ, the main properties of the
classical description should come from the features encoded in the well-defined set
PE .
    Another advantage of this picture is that it enables us to study the transfer of
information to the environment, as we will show in the next section.


5.5      Decoherence from broadcasting
In Section 3.3, we showed that sharp preserved observables which are duplicated
twice must form a classical set. We exploited this fact in Section 5.2 in order
Decoherence from broadcasting                                                     109


to provide a model of decoherence in terms of a sharp pointer observable. In
the previous section we familiarized ourselves with the idea of an unsharp pointer
observable. We will now try to generalize the result of Section 5.2 to unsharp
observables in order to have a full-fledged picture of decoherence. However, we will
see that in the case of unsharp observables, it is not sufficient to duplicate them
twice in order to make sure that they form a classical set. A counter example will
be provided in Section 5.5.2. Instead, we will show that the unsharp observables
which are duplicated an arbitrary number of times must form a classical set. Our
proof however will assume that we are dealing with a finite-dimensional quantum
system.
   We consider a channel E from the system with Hilbert space HA to an infinite
number of subsystems HB1 , HB2 , HB3 , . . . of the environment.

                        E : Bt (HA ) → Bt (HB1 ⊗ HB2 ⊗ . . . )                 (5.12)

If needed, the infinite tensor product Hilbert space can be made separable by keep-
ing only basis elements with a finite number of factors different from a special state
selected in each HBi [56]. The flow of information from A to the ith system Bi is
described by the channel
                                Ei : Bt (HA ) → Bt (HBi )
defined by
                                   Ei (ρ) = Tr0i E(ρ)                          (5.13)
where Tr0i is the partial trace over all subsystems but the ith. We want to charac-
terize the information which is preserved by all these channels at the same time.
This information is encoded in the set of observables which are preserved by all the
channels:                                  \
                                      I=      PE i
                                            i

We will say that the observables in this set are broadcast. We can show that any
countable set {Xi } ⊂ I is classical, in the sense that all the observables in it
are coarse-grainings of a single observable (see Section 5.3). Indeed, let Yi be the
observable such that Xi = Yi ◦ Ei , which exists thank to the assumption that Xi is
preserved by Ei . Then consider the observable

                              Γ := (Y1 ⊗ Y2 ⊗ . . . ) ◦ E.

It is clear that all the observables Xi are marginals of Γ. Indeed, measuring Γ
and then discarding all classical output subsystems but the ith is equivalent to
measuring Yi ◦ Ei = Xi . This proves that {Xi } ⊂ PΓ . Note that any coarse-graining
or convex combination of these observables Xi is also in PΓ .
   If the set I was separable with respect to a certain topology T, then we would
have that {Xi } can be chosen to be dense in I, so that

                                       I ⊆ PΓ
110                                                                      Decoherence


where the horizontal bar denotes closure with respect to the topology T. This would
show that a single observable Γ suffices to simulate the broadcast observables in I
to arbitrary precision (with respect to T), and therefore that the set I is classical,
and characterized by the pointer observable Γ, in this somewhat more general sense.
   The set I can be made separable under the following assumptions

  1. It includes only observable taking value in a single set Ω. For instance, one
     could pick the disjoint union Ω = R ∪ N in order to include both continuous
     and discrete observables.
  2. The source Hilbert space HA (on which the observables in I are defined), is
     finite-dimensional.

The finite dimensionality of HA in fact guarantees that the whole set of observables
of the form X : Bt (HA ) → L1 (Ω) is separable. Indeed, consider a basis σi of Bt (H).
Each observable X is entirely characterized by its components X(σi ) ∈ L1 (Ω).
Given that there is a finite number of them, and that L1 (Ω) itself is separable, the
set of all these observables is also separable. The topology T which is involved here
is defined by the metric

                         d(X, Y ) = max kX(σi ) − Y (σi )k1                    (5.14)
                                       i

where k · k1 is the norm in L1 (Ω).
   This proves the following:
Theorem 5.3. Let E be a channel of the form specified by Equation 5.12, with the
source Hilbert space HA finite-dimensional. Then the set IΩ of observables with
values in a given measure space Ω, which are preserved by all the partial channels
Ei , can be approximated arbitrarily well by coarse-grainings of a single observable
Γ, in terms of the distance defined by Equation 5.14.

   We will look at the consequences of this result in Section 5.6. But first, let us
examine the question of the correlations induced by unsharp preserved observables.


5.5.1     Correlations
In Section 5.2.1 we showed that a sharp observable which is duplicated twice im-
plies the existence of exact correlations between the two destination systems. For
unsharp observables, the correlation will in general not be exact. However, there
are cases where the correlation is exact even for genuinely unsharp observables. To
show this, let us give a slightly more general form of the result derived in Section
5.2.1.
   Consider a discrete observable X with effects Xi . Suppose that for each i, Pi is
a projector satisfying
                                  Pi⊥ Xi Pi⊥ = 0.
Decoherence from broadcasting                                                  111


We will assume that this observable X is preserved by two channels E1 and E2
which are given by two different partial traces of the same channel E. For instance
they could be any pairs of channel Ei defined in Equation 5.13. Hence, there exists
observables Y and Z which are such that Xi = E1∗ (Yi ), Xi = E2∗ (Zi ) for all i.
      We have
                               Xi = E ∗ (Yi ⊗ 1) = E ∗ (1 ⊗ Zi )             (5.15)
If we multiply by Pi⊥ on both sides in each term, we obtain

                        0 = Pi⊥ E ∗ (Yi ⊗ 1)Pi⊥ = Pi⊥ E ∗ (1 ⊗ Zi )Pi⊥ .

If Ek are the elements of the channel E, then using Lemma 3.2 we get

                             (Yi ⊗ 1)Ek = (1 ⊗ Zi )Ek = Ek Pi

Together, these two equations yield

                             (Yi ⊗ Zj )Ek = (Yi ⊗ Zj )Ek (Pi Pj )n

where n is an arbitrary integer. In the limit for n → ∞, we get a new projector
Pij on the right-hand side which projects on the intersection of the subspaces cor-
responding to Pi and Pj . Hence, if our observable X is such that Pi and Pj project
on subspaces with trivial intersections, then

                              (Yi ⊗ Zj )Ek = (Yi ⊗ Zj )Ek δij Pi

which implies that whenever i 6= j,

                                      E ∗ (Yi ⊗ Zj ) = 0.

Hence Y and Z are fully correlated. Note that we had to assume that the supports
of the effects Xi all have trivial intersections. This happens for instance if Xi ∝
|ψi ihψi | and the states |ψi i are all distinct (but not necessarily orthogonal).
   More generally, we do not expect that a duplicated unsharp observable will
always induce exact correlations between the target systems. However, we expect
that the amount of correlations between Y and Z is related to the information
content of the observable X, as defined in Section 2.1.3.


5.5.2       Non-classical two-fold broadcasting
We showed that sharp observables must form a classical set when duplicated twice.
For unsharp observables however, we showed that they form a classical set under
the assumption of an infinite quantity of copies (Theorem 5.3). Can we arrive at
the same conclusion under a weaker assumption, in the unsharp case? Here we
give an example which shows that, unlike for the sharp case, two copies are not
sufficient1 .

    Consider the isometry V which embeds a three dimensional Hilbert space H
into the antisymmetric subspace of the tensor product H ⊗ H as
                                           X 1
                                    V =        √ ijk |ijihk|

                                                2

where ijk is the totally antisymmetric tensor (in three dimensions), and |ii, i ∈
0, 1, 2 are an orthonormal basis of H, and |iji := |ii ⊗ |ji. If we trace out one of
the space H after the action of the isometry, we obtain a channel whose dual is

                  E ∗ (A) = V ∗ (A ⊗ 1)V

                            2
where AT is the transpose of A seen as a matrix with respect to the basis |ii. By
construction, it is clear that this map is completely positive and unital, and that

                                                E = Ec

since tracing-out the other destination subsystem yields exactly the same channel.
Therefore, the whole set of observables preserved by E is also preserved by Ec and
is therefore duplicated.
    Let us suppose that the set of preserved observable is classical, i.e. that there
exists an observable Γ such that all preserved observables are coarse-grainings of Γ.
We want to reach a contradiction.
  First, let us show that the channel E is covariant for the whole unitary group
U(H). Indeed, for any unitary U on H we have

                                      1
                      E ∗ (U ∗ AU ) = (Tr(U ∗ AU )1 − (U ∗ AU )T )

Decoherence from broadcasting                                                                 113


where U is the complex conjugate of U , which is also a unitary operator. In fact,
g 7→ U g is also a representation of the group.
   As seen in Section 5.4.2, this implies that there is a covariant pointer observable
Γ, defined by                         Z
                                 ∗
                                Γ (α) =             U ∗ Γ∗ (αU )U dU.

where αU (x) := α(U, x) for all U ∈ U(H) and x ∈ Ω, the set in which Γ takes value.
this observable Γ is covariant in terms of the representation λ on U(H) × Ω defined
by
                                 λU (V, x) = (V U ∗ , x)
for any unitary operators U, V and any x ∈ Ω.
   In fact we can build a covariant pointer observable which is more generic that Γ.
First, note that each matrix element hi|Γ∗ (α)|ji defines a normal linear map from
L∞ (Ω) to C, i.e. it can be associated with an element µij of the pre-dual L1 (Ω)
such that                            Z
                            ∗
                       hi|Γ (α)|ji =     µij (U, x) α(U, x) dx.
                                                   Ω
For each x we can build the matrix
                                              X
                                     Γx :=              µij (x)|iihj|.
                                               ij

We then have                                        Z
                                         ∗
                                     Γ (α) =               α(x)Γx dx
                                                       Ω
The operators Γx are the continuous equivalent of the elements
                                                         P x of a discrete xPOVM.
If we diagonalize these operators we obtain Γx =           i λi |iihi|x where λi is the
eigenvalue of Γx with eigenstate |iix . We pick unitary operators Uix which are such
that |iix = Uix |0i, where |0i is some fixed arbitrary state.
   Recall that given our assumptions, for each observable X there is a stochastic
                                 ∗
map π such that E ∗ (X ∗ (α)) = Γ (π ∗ (α)). Expanding the right-hand side of this
equation, we obtain

           E (X (α)) = U ∗ Γ∗ ((π ∗ (α))U )U dU.

where we have defined the observable

                               ∆ : B(H) → L1 (U(H))

by                                    Z
                           ∗
                         ∆ (α) := 3       α(U )U ∗ |0ih0|U dU

and the stochastic map (or classical observable)

                               Π : L1 (U(H)) → L1 (ΩX )

by                                        Z

                                  3 i

   Since all preserved observable must be coarse-grainings of ∆, then in particular,
we must have that
                                             Z
                  ∗         1

                            2

for some effect α in L∞ (U(H)). But this is not possible. Indeed, we would have
                          Z
                            α(U ) hi|U ∗ |0ih0|U |ii dU = 0

which implies that for all U , either α(U ) = 0 or h0|U |ii = 0. Hence the integral
in Equation 5.16 is supported on the set of unitary operators U which are such
that h0|U |ii = 0. But this set is of measure zero. This means that we must have
E ∗ (|iihi|) = 0, which contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore the set of preserved
observables in this example is not classical, even though it has been duplicated
twice.


5.5.3    Example: symmetric broadcasting
We consider the optimal fully symmetric quantum cloning machine introduced in
[57]. This is a channel which approximately copies n to m qubits without discrim-
ination in favour of any state, and with optimal fidelity. In the case n = 1, each
                     (m)
individual channel Ek resulting from tracing out all destinations qubits but one,
is of the form
                          (m)                           1
                         Ek (ρ) = αm ρ + (1 − αm ) Tr(ρ) 1.
                                                        2
In the limit of an infinite number of copies (m → ∞), the parameter α tends to
α∞ = 13 :
                                    (∞)    1     2      1
                         Ek (ρ) := Ek (ρ) = ρ + Tr(ρ) 1.

Since these channels are identical for every k, the information preserved by one of
them is also preserved by all the other channels. Therefore I = PEk for any k. Note
that Ek∗ is invertible. This means that we can apply Proposition 3.1, which states
that the observables preserved by Ek are those whose effects are all preserved.
    We will show that the preserved effects Ek∗ (E(H)) are all coarse-grainings of
any of the symmetric informationally complete (SIC) POVMs [58]. A POVM is
said to be informationally complete if its elements Xi span the space of density
operators, which implies that its statistics entirely determines the state. Indeed,
the component of a state ρ associated with the basis element Xi is given by the scalar
product Tr(ρXi ) which is also the probability for the ith outcome in a measurement
of X.
    For a qubit, such a POVM must have at least four elements. Indeed, the Hermic-
ity condition on states selects a four dimensional subspace of the space of matrices.
Note that the condition that the trace be unity, although it does reduce the di-
mension of the manifold of states to three, does not do so in a linear fashion. An
informationally complete POVM is further said to be symmetrical if the scalar
product Tr(Xi Xj ) is the same for all pairs of distinct POVM elements. In addition,
one usually assumes that the elements Xi are of rank one.
     For a qubit, a SIC-POVM Γ has elements {Γ0 , Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 } which are proportional
to projectors onto four pure states |ψi i. If we represent these states in the Bloch
sphere, i.e. in terms of their traceless components λij = Tr((|ψi ihψi | − 21 1)σj ) where
σj , j = 1, . . . , 3 are the Pauli operators, these states correspond to the vertices of
a regular tetrahedron inscribed in the Bloch sphere.
   The set of effects preserved by Γ is
                                     X
                        Γ∗ (E(Ω)) = {   αi Γi | 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1}.
                                        i∈Ω

where Ω = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Let us picture this convex set in the space of Hermitian
matrices spanned by the Pauli basis {1, σ1 , σ2 , σ3 }. Note first that the boundary of
the set E(H) of all the quantum effects is a double cone with tips at 0 and 1. The
intersection of the two cones is the Bloch sphere in the 3-sub-manifold of trace-one
operators (i.e. with component 21 in the direction specified by the identity 1). The
subset Γ∗ (E(Ω)) is made of two pyramids whose tips are also 0 and 1 and whose
edges are on the surface of the cones and intersect the Bloch sphere where the pure
states |ψi i are. (This is the four-dimensional version of the n = 3 case represented
in Figure 3.2.)
   This set contains the set Ek∗ (E(H)) of effects preserved by Ek∗ :

                                Ek∗ (E(H)) ⊂ Γ∗ (E(Ω)).

Indeed, the action of the channel Ek∗ consists in reducing the radius of the two cones
representing E(H) by a factor one-third, which creates two smaller cones which are
precisely inscribed into the two pyramids defining Γ∗ (E(Ω)). This fact follows from
116                                                                     Decoherence


knowing that the largest sphere inscribed in a regular tetrahedron (which is the
shape of the base of these four-dimensional pyramids) has radius equal to one-third
the distance from the center to any of the vertices.
    Hence all the effects preserved by E are also coarse-grainings of Γ. Since the
operators Γi are linearly independent, Γ∗ is invertible, which implies that any ob-
servable made of effects preserved by Γ is also preserved by Γ. Hence, any observable
which is preserved by the channel Ek has its effects in Ek∗ (E(H)) ⊂ Γ∗ (E(Ω)) and is
therefore a coarse-graining of Γ.
   This shows that for this example,

                                       I ⊂ PΓ

for any SIC-POVM Γ. Note that all the SIC-POVMs are given by applying an
arbitrary unitary transformation to any given one. In this example, the channel E
is covariant with respect to the whole unitary group. Indeed,
                             1        2     1
                 E(U ρU ∗ ) = U ρU ∗ + Tr(ρ) U U ∗ = U E(ρ)U ∗ .
                             3        3     2
This is the reason why any unitary transformation of our pointer-observable Γ is
also a pointer observable.


5.5.4    Example: iterated interactions
Consider an interaction defined by the isometry V : H → H ⊗ HE , where HE de-
notes a subsystem of the environment, and H is finite-dimensional. This interaction
can be iterated in a way which adds a new subsystem of the environment at each
iteration. For instance, the third iteration is given by the isometry

                        V (3) : H → H ⊗ HE1 ⊗ HE2 ⊗ HE3

where HE3 ≃ HE2 ≃ HE1 ≡ HE , which is defined by

                        V (3) |ψi = ((V ⊗ 1E2 )V ⊗ 1E1 )V |ψi.

An example would be a system colliding with different particles, one after the other.
The system HEn corresponds to the nth particle it has interacted with.
   The channel E describing the evolution of the system during each interaction is
given by
                            E ∗ (A) := V ∗ (A ⊗ 1E )V
and has for complement
                               Ec∗ (B) := V ∗ (1 ⊗ B)V.
These two channel can be used to describe the channel

from the initial state of the system to the final state of the kth particle of the
environment:
                                Ek (ρ) = Ec (E k−1 (ρ))
where, by E k−1 we mean k − 1 iterations of the channel E. It is clear from the
definition that the observables preserved by E n are also preserved by E m whenever
m ≤ n. Therefore, the observables preserved by Em are also preserved by En
whenever m ≤ n. This implies that the observables I preserved by all the channels
En , k ≤ n are also preserved by Ek = Ec ◦ E k−1 . What is I in the limit k → ∞?
    Let us assume that H is finite-dimensional. Then we know[39] that there is an
increasing sequence of integers {ki }∞
                                     i=1 ⊆ N which is such that in the limit i → ∞,
   ki ∗
(E ) tends to a projective unital completely positive map P which projects on the
fixed point set Fix E ∗ . This shows that the observables preserved by the channels
E k for all k ∈ N are those which are fixed by E, i.e. such that
                                     X = X ◦ E.
Note that this is a case where the preserved observables are entirely characterized
by the preserved effects.
   An effect A which is preserved by all the channels E k , k ∈ N must be such that
                                   A = P(Ec∗ (B))
for some effect B. This implies in particular that A ∈ Fix E ∗ . But what can we
deduce about Ec∗ (B)?
    For simplicity, let us suppose that E is unital, i.e. E(1) = 1. Then we know
[59], that Fix E ∗ is a ∗-algebra, which we will call A. Clearly it is also trivially a
correctable algebra for E. Therefore we know from Corollary 3.8 that all the effects
in Ec∗ (E(HE )) must belong to the commutant A0 :
                                  Ec∗ (E(HE )) ⊂ A0 .

    We have seen in Section 4.3.1 that the center Z(A) is characterized by a com-
plete orthogonal family of subspace Hk , which we will associate with isometries Vk
and projectors Pk = Vk Vk∗ . A generic element A ∈ A is of the form
                                   X
                              A=       Vk (Ak ⊗ 1k )Vk∗
                                     k

where Ak ⊗ 1k is an operator on Hk . Similarly, an element B ∈ Ec∗ (E(HE )) ⊆ A0 is
of the form                      X
                            B=       Vk (1k ⊗ Bk )Vk∗ .
                                     k

   In addition, since P fixes A, its channel elements Ei must all belong to the
commutant A0 [60]. This can be seen by studying its effects on projectors inside
A, and using Lemma 3.2. This implies that it is of the form
                          X
                  P(A) =      Vk (1k ⊗ (Eki )∗ )Vk∗ AVj (1j ⊗ Eji )Vj∗
                            ijk
118                                                                       Decoherence


Hence we can deduce that an effect A preserved by all channels Ek is of the form
                          X
             A = P(B) =      Vk (1k ⊗ (Eki )∗ )(1k ⊗ Bk )(1k ⊗ Eki )Vk∗
                                 ik
                     X
                 =        Vk (1k ⊗ (Eki )∗ Bk Eki )Vk∗
                     ik

where we assumed that B ∈ Ec∗ (E(HE )) ⊂ A0 . This shows that A ∈ A0 . But we
also know that A ∈ A since it is in the image of P. Hence A ∈ A ∩ A0 = Z(A).
                                                                    T
    Therefore, in the case where E is unital, the observables in I = k PEk all belong
to a commutative algebra: the center of the algebra A = Fix E ∗ .


5.6      Discussion
Let us summarize the picture of decoherence suggested by Theorem 5.3. We con-
sidered a quantum system undergoing an open evolution, i.e. interacting with its
environment. Nothing forces the information preserved in the system to be clas-
sical, unless the evolution is a “fully decoherent” channel of the form studied in
Section 5.4. However, we have seen that the information which is broadcast redun-
dantly to the environment is characterized by a classical set of observables I ⊆ PΓ .
This process is the physical realization of a measurement of the pointer observable
Γ on the system by the environment. The redundancy guarantees the objectivity
of the information stored in the environment, as argued in [10]. Furthermore, if
this information is also preserved in the system itself during the interaction, then
the information contained in the environment is correlated with that contained in
the final state of the system (even if it evolved). Therefore this information has
predictive power and can characterize the state of a deterministic effective classical
model of the system.
    In this picture, the pointer observable can be defined even if it does not represent
information which is preserved in the system. In this case, the emergent classical
degrees of freedom represent a classical system subject to noise. Alternatively, the
process of decoherence in this situation can be seen as a destructive or partially
destructive measurement.
    Note that if I = PΓ this process represents an exact measurement of Γ by
the environment, whereas I ( PΓ implies that the environment does not gain full
information about Γ. In this case, Γ represents only an approximate description of
the information present in the environment. This also means that there exists an
ambiguity in the pointer observable due to the arbitrariness of the extra information
contained in PΓ .
   Finally, we observed that even if the measurement of Γ by the environment is
complete, the corresponding classical limit may have some forbidden states. In-
deed, if Γ represents an approximate simultaneous measurement of non-commuting

observables, the classical states in its image are constrained to respect the corre-
sponding uncertainty relations. However we expect these quantum constraints on
the effective classical states to be irrelevant for phase-space observations coarser
than ~.




5.6.1    Universality of classicality

The main advantage of this picture is that it relies on very little physical assump-
tions. For instance, no particular model of interaction has been assumed. We
did however, make one rather unusual assumption which requires some comments,
namely the idea that only redundant information matters at macroscopic scales.
This idea seems intuitively reasonable as redundancy of information evokes the
amplification of a signal. In addition, we cannot think of any classical degree of
freedom which is not represented redundantly in a way or another, given that large
systems are always made of many particles which share the essential properties of
the object. As an example, we can think of the position of a rigid body. Certainly,
knowing the position of any of its molecule would suffice to localize it.

    In fact, since what it means to be macroscopic has never been defined unam-
biguously, it is tempting to think of this assumption as a mere definition. Indeed,
we could say that macroscopic physics is that which deals with highly redundant
information. In this view, that which is “macro-” in “macroscopic”, i.e. large, is
the number of equivalent representations of the same information. If we accept this
postulate, then Theorem 5.3 shows that macroscopic information is always classi-
cal, hence making the universality of classicality at macroscopic scales a tautology.
A problem with this view is that the our notion of redundancy relies entirely on a
preferred decomposition of the environment into subsystems. For our interpretation
to make sense, the decomposition should be such that a classical observer is only
able to measure observables which are local with respect to this decomposition.

   This view stands in contrast to the standard approach on this question, which
consists in the study of realistic models under a class of assumptions as broad as
possible, with the aim of showing that they are indeed fully decoherent, in the
sense that their evolution destroys all but classical information [13]. However such
studies have a point: decoherence is omnipresent even in microscopic experiments,
which is why building a quantum computer is so difficult.

   These two views may be reconciled if we consider that quantum experiments
are about the control of a microscopic system by a macroscopic one, which is
by definition subject to decoherence. Macroscopic systems are those which are
extremely efficient at spreading information. It is therefore no surprise that when
put in contact with quantum systems, classical instruments cause a decoherence
which may otherwise be absent.

5.6.2     Outlook: dynamics and constraints
To conclude, we will say a few words about the possibility of integrating dynamics
into our model of decoherence, which is an open question.
    Let us consider the “broadcasting” channel E defined by Equation 5.12. As
already explained in the beginning of Section 5.6, in order to obtain a dynamical
effective classical theory, we need to assume that the information represented by
the set I is also preserved in the system. We will suppose that the evolution of the
system itself is given by the channel EA . This channel represents only the relation
between two specific moments in time. However, if E and EA are obtained from a
unitary interaction generated by a Hamiltonian, they naturally depend on the time
at which we decide to trace out the system or the environment respectively. In
fact, we need not trace-out both at the same time. For instance, we could use the
channel E as it is at asymptotic times, assuming that the environment permanently
keeps a record of the relevant information about the system.
    Recall that the channel E to the environment selects a classical model charac-
terized by the set of observables I, or its approximate representation given by the
pointer observable Γ which is such that PΓ ⊇ I. We suppose that, in addition,
EA (t) preserves I for all time t. This means that for any observable X ∈ I, there
exists a family of observables Y (t) which are such that X = Y (t) ◦ EA (t). The
time-dependant observable Y (t) represents how the information about the initial
property X evolves in time. A problem is that in general, Y (t) has no reason to be-
long to the set I or to its idealization PΓ . Therefore, the map X 7→ Y (t) cannot be
understood as a “classical” transformation within I in any straitforward manner.
This indicates that, in order to be able to compare observables at different times
and identify an effective classical dynamics, some extra assumptions or inputs are
needed.
   In principle, what we expect is that the environment is continuously monitoring
the same observables of the system. However it is not easy to see how to model this
phenomenon in our framework. Indeed, the time-dependant channel E(t) from the
system to the environment only describes the information that the environment at
time t contains about the initial state of the system. Of course we could instead
consider discrete successive measurement of the system by different parts of the
environment, which should in fact be close the what really happens. However, this
would seem to remove one of the advantages of our picture, namely its ability to
describe a continuous decoherence process.
   We will leave these questions open for further work. For now, let us introduce
another possible approach, which consists in considering time as a variable of the
system with no special status.
   There are two ways of interpreting the phase-space Ω of a classical system. It
can be seen as representing the state of the system at a given time, but it can also be
understood as representing all physically allowed histories of that classical system.
Indeed, for simple unconstrained systems, the elements of Ω are one-to-one with
Discussion                                                                          121


possible time histories. If, in addition, the system described by the phase-space Ω
contains a physical clock, then the external time becomes superfluous and can be
considered as gauge.
    The same should be true in quantum mechanics. A quantum state |ψi ∈ H
can be understood as describing our general knowledge of the system, without any
assumption about time. This is particularly apparent in the Heisenberg picture,
in which time simply labels the possible observations. This point of view yields a
different light on a classical limit of the form Γ : Bt (H) → L1 (Ω), which now maps
quantum histories to classical histories.
    Let us therefore suppose that we have such a “timeless” quantum system de-
scribed by the Hilbert space H. Since our decoherence framework does not make
any explicit mention of time, we can still consider an environment B with subsys-
tems B1 , B2 , . . . and a channel

                         E : Bt (H) → Bt (HB1 ⊗ HB2 ⊗ . . . )

which represents how information about H happens to be contained in the envi-
ronment, and expect Γ to emerge as described in Section 5.5.
    In a sense, the map Γ directly takes into account the dynamics. Note however
that the classical set of histories Ω may need to be larger than what we really
expect. Remember that in our picture the limit ~ → 0 is taken only at a later
stage, when the constraints on the classical states L1 (Ω) imposed by the quantum
uncertainty relations are ignored. In the case where the limit of whole quantum
histories is taken into account, it is likely that the classical limit that we get for
finite ~, which is characterized by Γ, yields mixtures of trajectories which differ
by powers of ~, and hence explore paths which are not characterized by the ideal
classical phase-space.
    There is another problem with this picture, which is that, for realistic interacting
theories, the structure of the set of physical solutions is never fully understood.
Therefore we do not know the space H to start with. In fact, this is what equations
of motions, or more generally field equations, are about: they allow one to express
local properties of the physical system without having to understand its global
behaviour. Equations of motion are local in time, while full field equations are also
local in space.
   Note also that field equations do not only describe the evolution of the field in
time, but may also describe spacial constraints that the field must satisfy. In fact
we can view the equations of motions themselves as constraint on possible histories,
which allows to unify the picture.
   This fact is especially vivid in the case of general relativity, where no physical
notion of time exists prior to solving all of the equations which govern the theory.
In this sense, if by “dynamics” we refer to the process of solving the equations
of motion, then the dynamics of general relativity has nothing to do with time.
Instead, one start from the set of all “kinematical” histories, defined by all possible
122                                                                      Decoherence


metrics (and matter fields) on a fixed spacetime manifold, and then solves Einstein’s
equations in order to obtain the “physical” histories. Einstein’s equations can
be interpreted as specifying a constraint on the kinematical histories. In fact it
is not difficult to formulate any classical theory in a similar way, given that the
equations of motions can always be interpreted as specifying some constraint on
general histories of the usual phase-space variables.
    Instead of giving a classical example, let us directly show that the same can
be done in quantum mechanics. We will follow Rovelli [61, 62] and show how the
dynamics of a non-relativistic quantum particle can be formulated as a constraint,
implemented as a projector on a “kinematical” extended Hilbert space. Consider a
single, one-dimensional, non-relativistic particle with standard Hamiltonian

                                           pb2
                                      H=       + φ(b
                                                   x).
                                           2m
In the position representation, the time-evolution of a particle with initial state
ψ0 ∈ H = L2 (R) is given by Schrödinger’s equation

                             ∂ψt (x)    ~2 ∂ 2 ψt (x)
                        i~           =−               + φ(x)ψt (x).
                               ∂t       2m ∂x2
This equation can be reinterpreted as an equation on ψ ∈ HK := L2 (R2 ):

                        ∂ψ(x, t)   ~2 ∂ 2 ψ(x, t)
                   i~            +                + φ(x)ψ(x, t) = 0.
                          ∂t       2m ∂x2

What this is saying is that ψ must belong to the kernel of an operator Cb on L2 (R2 )
which is defined by
                                             2
                                C
                                b := Eb − pb − φ(b x).
                                          2m
where E  b := i~ ∂ and p̂ := i~ ∂ . Technically, although Cb has 0 in its spectrum,
                 ∂t             ∂x
its kernel is empty because the solutions to Schrödinger’s equation cannot be nor-
malized in L2 (R2 ). Indeed, we know that it preserves probabilities in time, which
means that the square of |ψ(x, t)| integrated over x is the same at any fixed time
t, which implies that the integral over t will diverge. There are various ways to
go around this problem. Here, let us simply suppose that we are working within a
finite interval of time. Therefore, we redefine HK as

                                   HK = L2 (R × [0, T ]).

This does not change anything about the properties of Schrödinger’s equation, but
it has the advantage of putting all the (time-limited) solutions inside HK . The
drawback is that C b here is not self-adjoint, however it does have a kernel which is
                                                             b inside HK . There is an
all we need from it. Let P be the projector on the kernel of C
                                     ∗                 ∗
isometry V : H → HK such that V V = 1H , and V V = P . Indeed, we know from
the properties of Schrödinger’s equation that the space of solutions is isomorphic to
Discussion                                                                           123


H = L2 (R). The map V ∗ represents the “effect” of solving Schrödinger’s equation:
it projects on the space of solutions.
    Let us give an example of a possible classical limit for this dynamical system.
To this construction, we add Γ0 , the coherent-state observable on H = L2 (R)
introduced in Section 5.1. If Γ0 really defines the classical limit of the theory, we
may hope that it indirectly maps the quantum evolution defined by the isometry
V to an effective classical evolution. Let us write V for the channel defined by
V , i.e. V(ρ) := V ρV ∗ for a state ρ of H. This channel V can be understood as
mapping our knowledge of the initial state into a knowledge of the whole history
of the particle.
    In order to obtain a proposition for the classical limit of the dynamical system,
we first need to make some assumption about the classical limit of time itself.
Note that we introduced time as a quantum observable which commutes with both
the position and momentum operators. Indeed, time is a subsystem of its own
since HK = L2 (R) ⊗ L2 ([0, T ]). Let ΓT be the map which sends a state ρ of
the time subsystem L2 ([0, T ]) into the classical time state µ(t) = ht|ρ|ti, where
|ti represents the formal eigenstates of the time operator Tb. Overall we obtain
an extended classical limit ΓK := Γ0 ⊗ ΓT , which operates between quantum and
classical histories:
                           ΓK : Bt (HK ) → L1 (R2 × [0, T ])
It simply sends a state ρ of HK to the probability distribution

                        µ(q, p, t) = (hq, p| ⊗ ht|) ρ (|q, pi ⊗ |ti)              (5.17)

where |q, pi are coherent states. This map alone has nothing to do with the dynam-
ics contained in the isometry V. However suppose that the quantum states that we
use actually satisfy Schrödinger’s equation, i.e. ρ = V ρ0 V ∗ , where ρ0 is a state of
H. The resulting map
                                     Γ := ΓK ◦ V
does not directly give us a distribution over the classical phase-space, but instead
a probability distribution over classical histories:

                             Γ : Bt (H) → L1 (R2 × [0, T ]).

    Note that, although this map Γ is technically a valid abstract classical limit,
the resulting classical system is not deterministic in terms of the variable t ∈ [0, T ].
This is due to the fact that this picture assumes a process of decoherence which
does not interfere with the exact quantum evolution of the system. It amounts to
applying the map Γ0 on the state of an evolving quantum system independently
at each time, therefore erasing the information which would be required to predict
the evolution of an initial state. This shows that this cannot be a realistic model
of decoherence for this particular system.
