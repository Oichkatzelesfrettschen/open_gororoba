Abstract. A differential graded algebra can be viewed as an A∞ -algebra. By
a theorem of Kadeishvili, a dga over a field admits a quasi-isomorphism from
a minimal A∞ -algebra. We introduce the notion of a derived A∞ -algebra and
show that any dga A over an arbitrary commutative ground ring k is equivalent
to a minimal derived A∞ -algebra. Such a minimal derived A∞ -algebra model
for A is a k-projective resolution of the homology algebra of A together with
a family of maps satisfying appropriate relations.
As in the case of A∞ -algebras, it is possible to recover the dga up to quasiisomorphism from a minimal derived A∞ -algebra model. Hence the structure
we are describing provides a complete description of the quasi-isomorphism
type of the dga.

1. Introduction
An A∞ -algebra over a commutative ring k is a Z-graded k-module A with structure maps mj : A⊗j → A[2 − j] satisfying certain relations. A∞ -algebras were
introduced by Stasheff in the 1960’s [21]. We refer to Keller’s survey [13] for background and for references to the various applications A∞ -algebras have found in
different fields of mathematics.
A differential graded algebra over k is an A∞ -algebra with m1 the differential,
m2 the multiplication, and mj = 0 for j ≥ 3. If k is a field, a theorem of Kadeishvili
[11] asserts that every k-dga A admits a quasi-isomorphism of A∞ -algebras from
a minimal A∞ -algebra, where minimal means m1 = 0. The underlying graded
k-algebra of such a minimal model for A is the homology algebra H∗ (A). The
quasi-isomorphism type of A can be recovered from its minimal model. Therefore, minimal A∞ -algebras provide an alternative description for quasi-isomorphism
classes of dgas [13, §3.3], and the minimal A∞ -structure on H∗ (A) specifies precisely the additional information needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type
of a dga from its homology [13, §2.1].
From now on let k be a commutative ring. Then the conclusion of Kadeishvili’s
theorem will in general not hold if the homology H∗ (A) is not k-projective since
for example a k-linear cycle selection morphism may not exist.
The aim of the present paper is to generalize the notion of an A∞ -algebra to
a context in which a dga A admits a minimal model without restrictions on k or
H∗ (A), and thereby to provide a different description of the quasi-isomorphism type
of A.
Our approach is motivated by the following two observations. On the one hand,
A∞ -algebras are closely related to Hochschild cohomology. For example, the m3
of the minimal A∞ -structure on H∗ (A) is a cocycle in the Hochschild complex of
H∗ (A) whose cohomology class encodes relevant information about A; see [2]. On
the other hand, Hochschild cohomology is for many purposes the ‘wrong’ cohomology theory if we apply it to k-algebras which are not k-projective. In this case,

one should rather consider the derived Hochschild cohomology, which is also known
as Shukla cohomology. Following Baues and Pirashvili [1], the latter cohomology
theory can be defined as the Hochschild cohomology of a k-projective dga resolving
the algebra.
Our strategy for finding minimal models in the general context is therefore to
first take a k-projective resolution of H∗ (A) in the direction of a new grading, and
then to look for the analog to the minimal A∞ -structure on this bigraded k-module.
To take the additional grading into account, we introduce the notion of a derived
A∞ -algebra (dA∞ -algebra for short). A dA∞ -algebra is a (N, Z)-bigraded k-module
⊗j
E with structure maps mE
→ E[i, 2 − (i + j)] for i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 1 satisfying
ij : E
appropriate relations. It is minimal if mE
01 = 0. Both dgas and A∞ -algebras can
be considered as dA∞ -algebras concentrated in degree 0 of the N-grading. The
notion of equivalence suitable for our purposes is that of an E2 -equivalence of
dA∞ -algebras, which is detected on the iterated homology with respect to mE
01 and
mE
.

Theorem 1.1. Let A be a differential graded algebra over a commutative ring k.
There exists a k-projective minimal dA∞ -algebra E together with an E2 -equivalence
E → A of dA∞ -algebras. This minimal dA∞ -algebra model E of A is well defined
up to E2 -equivalences between k-projective minimal dA∞ -algebras. Particularly, the
E
bigraded k-module E together with the differential mE
11 and the multiplication m02
is a k-projective resolution of the graded k-algebra H∗ (A).
The first step in the proof of the theorem is to construct a dA∞ -algebra B with
mB
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3 together with a map B → A of dA∞ -algebras such that the
induced map H∗ (B, mB
01 ) → H∗ (A) is a k-projective resolution. To find such a
B, we employ the cofibrant replacement in a resolution model category structure
on the category of simplicial dgas. The second step is to replace B by a minimal
dA∞ -algebra, which is now possible since H∗ (B, mB
01 ) is k-projective.
E
E
If E is a minimal dA∞ -algebra model of the dga A, the sum mE
03 + m12 + m21 is a
cocycle in a complex computing the derived Hochschild cohomology of H∗ (A). Its
cohomology class does not depend on the choice of the minimal model. This derived
Hochschild cohomology class γA ∈ dHH3,−1 (H∗ (A)) associated with A generalizes
the Hochschild cohomology class of a dga over a field studied by Benson, Krause,
and Schwede in [2]. For example, γA determines all triple matric Massey products
in H∗ (A).
Let k = Z/p2 with p an odd prime, and let A be the dga which has a copy of
k in degrees 0 and 1 and multiplication by p as the differential A1 → A0 . Then
H∗ (A) is an exterior algebra over Fp on a class in degree one. In Example 5.1, we
describe a minimal dA∞ -algebra model of A. The derived Hochschild cohomology
class γA defined by means of this minimal model is non-zero.
The information encoded in a minimal dA∞ -algebra model is not restricted to
the resolution of H∗ (A) and the triple Massey products. In fact, we can recover the
dga from a minimal dA∞ -algebra model:
Theorem 1.2. For a dA∞ -algebra E, there is an associated differential graded
algebra Tot HomE (E, E). If E is a minimal dA∞ -algebra model of a dga A, the dga
Tot HomE (E, E) is quasi-isomorphic to A.
Therefore, we have given an answer to the question of which additional structure
is needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type of a dga over a commutative
ground ring from its homology algebra: A k-projective resolution of its homology
equipped with a minimal dA∞ -algebra structure provides the necessary information.
A different approach to describe quasi-isomorphism types of dgas is to use Postnikov systems and k-invariants. This approach is used by Dugger and Shipley in

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞ -ALGEBRAS

3

[4, §4] for their study of topological equivalences of dgas. One advantage of the
minimal dA∞ -algebra structures introduced in the present paper is that they also
exist for dgas with homology in negative degrees.
One may apply our results to Ext-algebras. If M is a k-module, the Yonedaalgebra Ext∗k (M, M ) is the homology of the endomorphism dga Homk (P, P ) of a kprojective resolution P of M . Hence a minimal dA∞ -algebra model for Homk (P, P )
provides a k-projective resolution of Ext∗k (M, M ) with structure maps mij . This
structure is well defined up to E2 -equivalence, and it reflects the quasi-isomorphism
type of Homk (P, P ). We calculate it for Ext∗Z (Z/p, Z/p). This generalizes the
existence of a minimal A∞ -structure on the extension algebra of a module over an
algebra over a field [13, §3.3].
Organization. In the second section, we define dA∞ -algebras and explain how
they generalize A∞ -algebras. We introduce bidgas and twisted dgas and define the
notion of E2 -equivalence. In the third section, we explain how dgas can be resolved
by bidgas. This makes use of Bousfield’s theory of resolution model categories.
The fourth section features the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we define
the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with a dga and describe the
examples mentioned in the Introduction. In the sixth section, we introduce modules
over dA∞ -algebras and use the enrichment of module categories in twisted chain
complexes to prove Theorem 1.2. The last section contains four lemmas needed in
Section 4.
Notation and conventions. Throughout the paper, k is a commutative ground
ring, and all tensor products are taken over k. We consider (N, Z)-bigraded kmodules E = (Est )s∈N,t∈Z . Their shift is defined by E[i, j]st = Es−i,t−j . We
sometimes refer to the N-grading as the horizontal direction and to the Z-grading
as the vertical direction.
The tensor product of two bigraded k-modules E and F is the bigraded k-module
E ⊗ F with
M
(1.3)
(E ⊗ F )uv =
Eij ⊗ Epq .
i+p=u, j+q=v

We follow the Kozul sign convention. For maps f : W → X[i, j], g : Y → Z[p, q]
and elements w ∈ Wst , y ∈ Yuv this means (f ⊗ g)(w ⊗ y) = (−1)hw,gi f (w) ⊗ g(y)
0
with hw, gi = sp + tq. Similarly, we get (f ⊗ g)(f 0 ⊗ g 0 ) = (−1)hf ,gi f f 0 ⊗ gg 0 for
tensor products of composable maps. Tensor product, shift, and sign convention
for k-modules with a single Z-grading are given accordingly.
We assume familiarity with the basics about A∞ -algebras, as for example described in Section 3 of Keller’s survey [13]. In our sign convention for A∞ -algebras,
we follow Lefèvre [14] and ask the structure maps mj of an A∞ -algebra to satisfy
P
(−1)rq+t mj (1⊗r ⊗ mq ⊗ 1⊗t ) = 0. Remark 4.4 explains our choice of signs.
2. dA∞ -algebras and twisted chain complexes
Our main object of study is the following generalization of an A∞ -algebra whose
definition was already outlined in the Introduction.
Definition 2.1. A derived A∞ -algebra (dA∞ -algebra for short) is a (N, Z)-bigraded
k-module E with k-module maps mij : E ⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] and a unit map
ηE : k → E for i ≥ 0, j ≥ 1 satisfying

and

ij (1

Example 2.4. A derived A∞ -algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 is the
same as a (strictly unital) A∞ -algebra with the m0j as structure maps: the equations (2.2)uv for u = 0 are the A∞ -relations. Since a k-dga A is a special instance
of an A∞ -algebra, it is a dA∞ -algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 for which
A
only mA
01 and m02 may be non-zero.
Definition 2.5. A map of dA∞ -algebras from E to F consists of a family of kmodule maps fpq : E ⊗q → F [p, 1 − (p + q)] with p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 1 satisfying
X
⊗t

Example 2.9. Maps between dA∞ -algebras concentrated in horizontal degree 0
are maps of A∞ -algebras.
In Section 4, we will give an equivalent but more economic description of dA∞ algebras and their maps in terms of a structure on the reduced tensor algebra of
E[0, 1]. Amongst others, we employ it to define the composition of dA∞ -algebra
maps and the notion of a module over a dA∞ -algebra, and it will also help to
explain the signs. We use the less streamlined Definition 2.1 here since both our
examples and our notion of equivalence fit in more naturally.
We single out an interesting special case of a dA∞ -algebra:
Definition 2.10. A bidga is a dA∞ -algebra B with mB
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3. A map
f : A → B of bidgas is a map of dA∞ -algebras with fpq = 0 for p + q ≥ 2. We write
bidgak for the resulting category.
Of course, dgas give rise to bidgas concentrated in horizontal degree 0.
Remark 2.11. The category bidgak admits a different description. Let biChk
be the category of (N, Z)-graded bicomplexes of k-modules. Objects are bigraded
k-modules E with differentials d0 : E → E[0, 1] and d1 : E → E[1, 0] satisfying
d0 d0 = 0, d1 d1 = 0, and d0 d1 = d1 d0 . The tensor product of bigraded k-modules
induces a symmetric monoidal product on biChk . A monoid in biChk is a bicomplex
B with a multiplication µ : B ⊗ B → B satisfying associativity, two Leibniz rules,
B
B
and a unit condition. Setting mB
01 = d0 , m11 = d1 and m02 = µ, we observe that
the six non-trivial formulas (2.2)uv for u + v ≤ 3 are the associativity law, the two
Leibniz rules, and the three identities for the differentials. After comparing the unit
conditions, we see that bidgak is the category of monoids in biChk . This is similar
to the characterization of dgas as the monoids in the category of chain complexes
with respect to the tensor product of chain complexes.

Definition 2.12. A twisted dga (tdga for short) is a dA∞ -algebra T for which only
mT02 and mTi1 with i ≥ 0 may be non-zero. A map f : T → S of tdgas is a map of
dA∞ -algebras with fpq = 0 if q ≥ 2. We write tdgak for the resulting category.
Every bidga is a tdga. The name twisted dga is chosen in view of
Definition 2.13. [6] A twisted chain complex E is an (N, Z)-graded k-module with
differentials dE
i : E → E[i, 1 − i] for i ≥ 0 satisfying
X
(2.14)u
(−1)i di dp = 0
i+p=u

for u ≥ 0. A map of twisted complexes E → F is a family of maps fi : E → F [i, −i]
satisfying
X
X
(2.15)u
(−1)i fi dE
dF
p =
i fp .
i+p=u

i+p=u

The
P composition of two maps f : E → F and g : F → G is defined by (gf )u =
i+p=u gi fp . We write tChk for the resulting category.
A class of examples arises from the fact that biChk is a subcategory of tChk . The
signs in Definition 2.13 differ from those in [6]. We explain our choice in Remark
4.4. Some authors use the term ‘multicomplex’ instead of ‘twisted chain complex’.
Remark 2.16. Similarly as in Remark 2.11, the tensor product of graded modules
defines a symmetric monoidal product on tChk . Monoids in tChk are tgas. The
resulting composition tdga maps is of course a special case of the composition of
dA∞ -algebra maps to be given in Definition 4.5.
Let E be a dA∞ -algebra. Identifying (2.2)uv for v = 1 with (2.14)u , we see that
the mE
i1 with i ≥ 0 specify the underlying twisted chain complex of E. For a map
f : E → F of dA∞ -algebras, the fi1 form a map of the underlying twisted chain
complexes. We thus occasionally write di for mE
i1 when we refer to the underlying
twisted chain complex of a dA∞ -algebra E.
Remark 2.17. The underlying twisted chain complex is one instance in which
twisted chain complexes behave to dA∞ -algebras as unbounded chain complexes
behave to A∞ -algebras. This analogy turns out to be fruitful, and we frequently
exploit it in Sections 4 and 6.
Next we study the passage from twisted chain complexes to chain complexes.
There is a total complex functor
M
Tot : tChk → Chk ,
Totn X =
Xst ,
s+t=n

where the differential d : Totn X → Totn−1 X is i≥0 dX
i . A map of twisted comP
plexes f : X → Y induces a map i≥0 fi of total complexes. This is well defined
since only finitely many dX
i or fi leave a fixed Xst .
If we consider the total complex as a twisted chain complex concentrated in
horizontal degree 0, there is a map ρX : X → Tot X of twisted chain complexes. Its
component (ρX )i : X → (Tot X)[i, −i] is the inclusion of Xi∗ into (Tot X)[i, −i]i∗ .
We can interpret ρ as a natural transformation from the identity on tChk to Tot.
The presence of this natural transformation is one advantage of the category of
twisted chain complexes over the category of bicomplexes.
P

Lemma 2.18. The functor Tot : tChk → Chk is strongly monoidal, and ρ is a
strong monoidal transformation. In particular, if E is a tdga, then Tot E is a dga,
and ρE : E → Tot E is a map of tdgas.

L
The total complex has a filtration defined by F p (Tot X)n = s≤p Xs,n−s . The
2 ∼
E2 -term of the resulting spectral sequence is Epq
= Hph Hqv (X). Here we write
v
H∗ (E) for the ‘vertical’ homology of E with respect to the differential d0 . By
(2.14)u for u = 2, d1 induces a differential on H∗v (E), and we write H∗h (H∗v (E)) for
the resulting ‘horizontal’ homology group.
Maps of twisted complexes induce maps of spectral sequences: given f : E → F
in tChk , f0 is a d0 -chain map on E → F , and formula (2.15)u for u = 1 ensures
that H∗v (f0 ) induces chain map with respect to the d1 -differential H∗v (d1 ). Hence
we obtain H∗h (H∗v (f0 )) on the E2 -term, and so on.
Definition 2.19. A map f : E → F of twisted complexes is an E2 -equivalence if
Hsh (Htv (f0 )) is an isomorphism for s ∈ N, t ∈ Z. A map of bicomplexes, bidgas,
twisted dgas or derived A∞ -algebras is an E2 -equivalence if the underlying map of
twisted chain complexes is.
Accordingly, f is an E1 -equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on H∗v , and
every E1 -equivalence is an E2 -equivalence.
The following lemma is immediate.
Lemma 2.20. If X is a twisted chain complex with E2 -homology concentrated in
horizontal degree 0, then ρX : X → Tot X is an E2 -equivalence.
3. Resolving dgas by bidgas
The aim of this section is to construct resolutions of dgas that induce resolutions
of their graded homology algebras. We saw that a dga can be considered as a bidga
concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Particularly, a graded k-algebra is a bidga
concentrated in horizontal degree 0 with both differentials trivial.
Definition 3.1. A termwise k-projective resolution of a graded algebra Λ is a
termwise k-projective bidga E with trivial vertical differential together with an
E2 -equivalence E → Λ of bidgas.
Here we think of a bidga with trivial vertical differential as a differential graded
algebra in graded algebras. If E → Λ is a termwise k-projective resolution, E∗,0 is
a dga which is k-projective and whose homology is isomorphic to Λ0 concentrated
in degree 0. In other words, a termwise k-projective resolution is the graded analog
of the resolution of a k-algebra by a degreewise k-projective dga.
If the graded algebra is the homology of a differential graded algebra, we can ask
even more:
Definition 3.2. Let A be a k-dga. A k-projective E1 -resolution of A is a bidga B
v
together with an E2 -equivalence B → A of bidgas such that Hst
(B) is k-projective
v
and the map k → H00 (B) induced by the unit k → B splits as a k-module map.
A termwise k-projective E1 -resolution of a dga A is a termwise k-projective
resolution of the graded algebra H∗v (A) which is induced from a resolution of the
dga and satisfies an additional unit condition.
Example 3.3. Let p be an odd prime and k = Z/p2 . The k-dga A = Λ∗Z/p2 (w)
with |w| = 1 and d(w) = p is non-formal and has homology Λ∗Fp (w) with |w| = 1.
It is also considered in [1, §5.2]. We will give a k-projective E1 -resolution of A.
Consider the (N, Z)-bigraded k-algebra
V = k[a, b, u, v]/(a2 , b2 , au − bv, auv, buv, u2 , v 2 ),
with |a| = |b| = (0, 0) and |u| = |v| = (0, 1). We set dV0 (u) = a and dV0 (v) = b. This
extends uniquely to a differential on V . We think of V as a dga concentrated in

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞ -ALGEBRAS

horizontal degree 0. Its homology is Λ∗k (z) with z is represented by au. Let H be
the (N, Z)-bigraded k-algebra
Λ∗k (x) ⊗ Γ∗k (y)

with

|x| = (1, 0), |y| = (2, 0),

concentrated in vertical degree 0. We define B = V ⊗ H, so that Bst = Vs0 ⊗ H0t .
The multiplications on V and H turn B into a bigraded k-algebra. Since dH
0 = 0
for degree reasons, the dV0 on V induces a vertical differential dB
satisfying
the
0
B
Leibniz rule. We define dB
(xy
)
=
(p
−
pa

b)y
and
d
(y
)
=
(p
−
b
−
ab)xy
i

where yi is the divided power algebra generator in degree 2i. The dB
is
linear
with
1
B
respect to a, b, u, and v, and dB
0 and d1 commute.
It is easy to see H∗v (B) = Λ∗k (x, z) ⊗ Γ∗k (y) as well as d1 (y i ) = p x y i−1 and
d1 (x y i ) = py i . Hence B is a bidga for which H∗v (B) is bidegreewise k-projective.
A map of bidgas α : B → A is defined by setting
α(y0 ) = 1, α(a) = p, α(b) = −p, α(u) = w, and α(v) = −w.
This is multiplicative and compatible with the relations among a, b, u, and v. Since
B
α(dB
1 (x)) = 0, the α is also compatible with d1 . Therefore, it is a bidga map. On
v
v
vertical homology α induces H∗ (α) : H∗ (B) → H∗v (A) sending y 0 to 1 and z to w.
This is easily seen to be a resolution of H∗v (A).
Returning to the general case, a map of k-projective E1 -resolutions from B → A
to B 0 → A is a bidga map f : B → B 0 making the obvious triangle commutative.
It is defined to be an E2 -equivalence if f is one.
Theorem 3.4. Every k-dga A admits a k-projective E1 -resolution B → A. Two
such resolutions can be related by a zig-zag of E2 -equivalences between k-projective
E1 -resolutions.
The proof of the theorem occupies the rest of the section. It uses Quillen’s
language of model categories [15, 9]. The point is to use the cofibrant replacement
in an appropriate model structure on the category sdgak of simplicial dgas.
We start by briefly recalling Bousfield’s general setup for resolution model structures [3], or rather the dual version of [10]. Let C be a pointed model category.
Let P be a class of group-objects in Ho(C). A morphism p : X → Y in Ho(C) is a
P-epi if p∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is onto for every P ∈ P and n ≥ 0, where [X, Y ]n =
Ho(C)(Σn X, Y ). An object A ∈ Ho(C) is P-projective if p∗ : [A, X]n → [A, Y ]n is
onto for all P-epis p and n ≥ 0. Maps in C (resp. objects in C) are P-epis (resp.
P-projective) if they are in Ho(C). A map in C is a P-projective cofibration if it
has the left lifting property with respect to all P-epi fibrations.
A map X → Y in
`
C is P-free if it is a composition of an inclusion
X
→
X
P
with
P cofibrant and
`
P-projective and an acyclic cofibration X P → Y . We say that Ho(C) has enough
P-projectives if every object X ∈ Ho(C) admits a P-epi Y → X with P-projective
source. In this case, we call P a class of projective models in Ho(C).
The next definition makes use of the standard model structure on the category
of simplicial groups ([15, II.3.7]), the Reedy model structure on sC [7, VII.2.12],
and the notion of the latching object Ln X and its structure map Ln X → Xn for
X ∈ sC [7, VII.1.5].
Definition 3.5. Let f : X → Y be a map in sC.
(i) f is a P-equivalence if f∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is a weak equivalence in simplicial
groups for all P ∈ P and n ≥ 0.
(ii) f is a P-fibration if it is a Reedy-fibration and f∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is a
fibration of simplicial groups for all P ∈ P `
and n ≥ 0.
(iii) f is a P-cofibration if the induced maps Xn Ln X Ln Y → Yn are P-projective
cofibrations for all n ≥ 0.

Theorem 3.6. [3, Theorem 3.3] Let C be a right proper pointed model category
and let P be a class of projective models for Ho(C). With the above P-equivalences,
P-fibrations, and P-cofibrations, sC becomes a right proper model category. It is
simplicial with respect to the external simplicial structure.
We frequently use the following feature of this model structure:
Lemma 3.7. A P-cofibration in sC is termwise a P-projective cofibration in C.
Proof. This is a consequence of [8, Lemma 15.3.9], compare [3, Lemma 5.3].



Our main example is the category Chk with the projective model structure [9,
Theorem 2.3.11]. Since Chk is stable, all objects in Ho(Chk ) are cogroup objects.
Let P be the set of objects {S n (k)|n ∈ Z} in Ho(Chk ) = D(k), where S n (k)i = k
if i = n and 0 otherwise. The P-epis are the maps which induce surjections in
homology.
Lemma 3.8. With this P, the category Ho(Chk ) has enough P-projectives. An
object in Ho(Chk ) is P-projective if and only if it has degreewise k-projective homology.
Proof. Since every object is the codomain of a P-epi mapping out of a sum of
objects in P, there are enough P-projectives. Applying this to a P-projective object
X shows that X is a retract of a sum of objects in P. Hence X has degreewise
k-projective homology. On the other hand, an object with degreewise k-projective
homology is a retract of a sum of objects of P, and therefore P-projective.

All objects in Chk are fibrant, so Chk is right proper. Theorem 3.6 yields the
P-model structure on sChk .
Analogous to the classical case of simplicial abelian groups and simplicial rings,
simplicial dgas can be considered as the monoids in the category sChk of simplicial
chain complexes with respect to the termwise tensor product.
Proposition 3.9. The forgetful functor U : sdgak → sChk creates a cofibrantly
generated model structure on sdgak in which a map f is a P-fibration or a Pequivalence if U (f ) is. Cofibrant objects in sdgak are termwise P-projective cofibrant in Chk . The unit map of a cofibrant replacement in sdgak splits in homology.
Proof. First notice that the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated.
To obtain the generating cofibrations I and generating acyclic cofibrations J, one
has to add the generating acyclic cofibrations of the Reedy model structure [8,
Proposition 15.6.24] to the two sets of maps described in [10, Lemma 2.7].
The projective model structure on Chk creates a model structure on dgak [18,
§5], which gives rise to a Reedy model structure on sdgak . As the matching object
functor is defined as a limit and the forgetful functor U commutes with limits, a
map f in sdgak is a Reedy fibration or a Reedy weak equivalence if and only if
U (f ) is.
Since all objects in simplicial abelian groups are fibrant, the P-fibrant objects in
sChk coincide with the Reedy fibrant objects. Therefore, the Reedy fibrant replacement functor in sdgak is a fibrant replacement functor for the P-model structure
to be constructed.
The cotensor of the external simplicial structure on sChk is defined as a limit [7,
p. 371] and therefore extends to a functor
homsdgak : S op × sdgak → sdgak .
As the P-model structure on sChk is simplicial, homsdgak (−, Y ) maps weak equivalences to P-equivalences and cofibrations to P-fibrations provided Y is P-fibrant.

Hence the simplicial path object for a fibrant object qualifies as a path object for
the P-model structure on sdgak we are heading for.
Since the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated, the verification
of the axioms for the P-model structure on sdgak now follows from applying [18,
Lemma 2.3(2)] to the left adjoint of U . As in Quillen’s original argument [15,
II.4.9], one can reduce the assumptions to presence of a path object and the fibrant
replacement functor as established above.
The generating cofibrations T (I) of the P-model structure on sdgak are obtained
by applying the free associative algebra functor T to I. If X is P-projective and
cofibrant, − ⊗ X preserves P-free maps. Cobase change also preserves P-free maps.
The maps in I are either termwise acyclic cofibrations
in the projective model
`
structure on Chk , or termwise of the form X → X P with P ∈ P. By the careful
analysis of the free associative algebra functor carried out in [18, Lemma 6.2], it
follows that for a termwise P-projective cofibrant X in sdgak , the map X → Y
obtained from attaching a generating cofibration f ∈ T (I) to X is is isomorphic
to the inclusion of X into the colimit of a countable sequence of termwise P-free
maps: inspecting the proof the second statement of the cited lemma, we see that
it is enough to provide the last four statements and Lemma 3.10.
The initial object of sdgak is itself termwise P-projective. Hence the map from
the initial object k to a cofibrant replacement constructed by means of the small
object argument applied to T (I) is termwise a transfinite composition of P-free
maps. Therefore, it splits in homology. In particular, any cofibrant replacement is
termwise P-projective cofibrant. By the retract argument, all cofibrant objects are
termwise P-projective cofibrant.

Let f : X → Y and g : X 0 → Y 0 be maps in Chk`
or sChk . We define the pushout
product map f g to be the induced map Y ⊗ X 0 X⊗X 0 X ⊗ Y 0 → Y ⊗ Y 0 .
Lemma 3.10. Let K be the class of termwise acyclic cofibrations in sChk`, and let
L be the class of maps in sChk which are termwise of the form X → X P with
P a P-projective cofibrant object. Then (K ∪ L)(K ∪ L) ⊂ (K ∪ L).
Proof. The pushout product axiom [19, Definition 3.1] holds in Chk . It states
that if f and g are cofibrations in Chk , then the pushout product map f g is a
cofibration which is acyclic if f or g is. The axiom immediately implies KK ⊂ K.
Since objects in P are cofibrant, it also shows that for P ∈ P and f ∈ K, the map
P ⊗ f is again in K. This argument implies KL ∪ LK ⊂ K. If both maps are
in L, it is enough to show that for two P-projective cofibrant objects P, P 0 ∈ P,
their product P ⊗ P 0 is P-projective cofibrant. Cofibrancy is clear. Since both have
k-projective homology, the E2 -term of the bicomplex spectral sequence computing
the homology of P ⊗ P 0 consists only of a single non-trivial line in which all entries
are k-projective. By Lemma 3.8, P ⊗ P 0 is P-cofibrant.

We need an instance of the Dold-Kan correspondence to go back and forth between simplicial chain complexes and bicomplexes. The version in [7, III Theorem
2.5] is sufficiently general to apply to our context.
The associated chain complex and normalized chain complex are functors
C : sChk → biChk

and

N : sChk → biChk .

The first is defined by C(X)s∗ = Xs with horizontal differential given by the alternating sum of the simplicial face maps, and N (X) is the quotient of C(X) by
the subobject generated by the image of the degeneracies. The functor N is an
equivalence of categories. Its inverse Γ : biChk → sChk can be defined by

Γ(E)n =

with the simplicial structure maps described on [7, p. 148].
The monoidal properties of these functors are as in the classical case discussed
in [19, §2.3,§2.4]. We have a shuffle map ∇ and the Alexander-Whitney map AW ,
∇ : CX ⊗ CY → C(X ⊗ Y )

and

AW : C(X ⊗ Y ) → CX ⊗ CY,

∇ is a lax monoidal transformation, AW is a lax comonoidal transformation, and
both maps preserve the subcomplexes of degenerate simplicies and induce
∇ : N X ⊗ N Y → N (X ⊗ Y )

and

AW : N (X ⊗ Y ) → N X ⊗ N Y.

For a simplicial dga X, the associated chain complex of the underlying simplicial
chain complex is a bidga with multiplication defined by
∇

CX ⊗ CX −→ C(X ⊗ X) → C(X).
Similarly, N X is a bidga. For a bidga B, the Alexander-Whitney map induces the
structure of a simplicial dga on Γ(B) [19, (2.9)]. As explained in [19, Remark 2.14],
the functors Γ and N do not induce an equivalence between sdgak and bidgak , due
to the failure of the unit of the adjunction to be monoidal. However, the adjunction
counit isomorphism N Γ ∼
= idbiChk is monoidal on the level of complexes [19, Lemma
2.11], which is sufficient for our purposes.
Lemma 3.11. (i) The functor C maps P-equivalences of simplicial dgas to E2 equivalences of bidgas.
(ii) For a k-bidga B, there is a canonical E2 -equivalence C(Γ(B)) → B of bidgas
which is natural in B.
Proof. It is enough to check (i) additively. Since C commutes with taking vertical homology, the assertion follows from the definition of P-equivalences and E2 equivalences.
The map in (ii) is the one inducing the counit N (Γ(B)) → B. It is a map of
bidgas since the counit is monoidal and the shuffle map is compatible with the
degeneracies. Both C and Γ (but not N ) commute with taking vertical homology,
so the Dold-Kan correspondence for simplicial k-modules and Ch+
k applied in each
vertical degree shows that C(Γ(B)) → B is an E2 -equivalence.

Proof of Theorem 3.4. We consider Γ(A), the constant simplicial dga A, and its
cofibrant replacement Γ(A)cof . Lemma 3.8 and Proposition 3.9 show that Γ(A)cof
has k-projective vertical homology. The unit is the composite k → C(Γ(k)) →
C(Γ(A)cof ), which splits in vertical homology by the last part of Proposition 3.9.
Lemma 3.11 then shows that the composite
C(Γ(A)cof ) → C(Γ(A)) → A
is a k-projective E1 -resolution. The second statement is the A = A0 case of the
next lemma.

4. Minimal dA∞ -algebras
We start by giving an alternative description of dA∞ -algebras and their maps.
Disregarding unit conditions, an A∞ -algebra structure on a Z-graded k-module
M can be encoded by giving a differential on the reduced tensor algebra of the
suspension of A [13, 21]. Next we explain how the structure of a twisted chain
complex on the reduced tensor algebra (in bigraded k-modules) describes a dA∞ algebra.
Let S be the shift [0, 1] of bigraded k-modules. There is a canonical isomorphism
σ : S → id[0, 1] of degree (0, 1). It induces an isomorphism

Ψj : Homk (E ⊗j , F ) → Hom((SE)⊗j , SF ) with σF (Ψj (f )) = (−1)hΨj (f ),σi f σE

A similar description applies to maps. Given bigraded k-modules E and F and
k-linear maps fpq : E ⊗q → F [p, 1 − (p + q)] with p ≥ 0, q ≥ 1, we define the map
1

fepq
to be Ψq (f ) : SE ⊗q → SF [p, −p]. The fepq
assemble to fep1 : T SE → SF [p, −p].

and write fep : T SE → T SF [p, −p], p ≥ 0, for the morphism mapping SE ⊗q to
j
SE ⊗j [p, −p] by fepq
.
Lemma 4.3. Let E and F be dA∞ -algebras and let fpq : E ⊗q → F [p, 1 − (p + q)]
a family of k-linear maps with p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 1 satisfying the unit condition (2.7).

Remark 4.4. One advantage of using the m

ij and the fij is that their bidegrees
e1
|m
eE
ij | = (i, 1 − i) and |fij | = (i, −i) do not depend on j. As one can already see
by comparing the last lemma with Definition 2.5, this reduces the complexity of
signs considerably. Because of this, we will frequently switch to the m
e ij for explicit
calculations.
However, there is still a choice behind our sign convention. For example, one
may omit the sign in the definition of twisted chain complexes. This would change
the sign in the definition of dA∞ -algebras and, in turn, the sign in the Leibniz rule
for bidgas. This would be in conflict with the signs resulting from the Dold-Kan
correspondence relating biChk and sdgak . In other words, our sign convention is
chosen to ensure that the chain complex associated to a simplicial dga is a dA∞ algebra.
At this point we can also make up the promised definition of the composition of
dA∞ -algebra maps.
Definition 4.5. Given two maps g : D → E and g : E → F , the component (ffg)u
P
of f g is i+p=u fei gep .
An A∞ -algebra is minimal if mA
1 = 0. This motivates
Definition 4.6. A dA∞ -algebra E is minimal if mE
01 = 0.
The device to produce minimal dA∞ -algebras is the following proposition. It
promotes both the statement and the proof of [11, Theorem 1] about A∞ -algebras
to the context of dA∞ -algebras.
Proposition 4.7. Let B be a bidga, let E be its homology with respect to mB
01 ,
and let d1 and µ be the differential and the multiplication induced on E. If E is
k-projective in every bidegree and the unit map ηE : k → E induced by ηB : k → B
splits as a k-module map, then there exists
E
(i) a minimal dA∞ -structure on E with mE

zeln of (4.8)ln is defined.
By Lemma 7.1, zeln has values in ker m

e E,1
01 . We define m
ln to be the composition

with the m

for mE
ln is easy.

The fln satisfy (2.6)uv for u + v = l + n by construction. By assumption, the


The input for the last proposition will be a k-projective E1 -resolution arising
form Theorem 3.4. Since these are only well defined up to E2 -equivalence, we need
to check that such an E2 -equivalence of bidgas induces a map of the associated
minimal dA∞ -algebras. This issue does not come up when constructing minimal
models in the world of A∞ -algebras, since the underlying graded algebra of a minimal A∞ -model is unique up to isomorphism [13, §8.7].
To formulate the next proposition, we need to introduce the notion of a homotopy
of dA∞ -algebra maps. We only define it in a special case.
Definition 4.9. Let f and g be dA∞ -algebra maps from a minimal dA∞ -algebra E
to a bidga C. A homotopy from g to f is a family of maps e

holds for u + v ≤ l + n and (4.10)uv holds for u + v < l + n. Then yln is defined,

Lemma 7.17 shows that (2.6)uv holds for u + v = l + n + 1, and the unit condition
(2.7) can be checked readily. Since E is k-projective we can find e
hln such that
(4.10)uv holds for u + v = l + n. The splitting of the unit of E enables us to change
e
hln such that (4.11) holds.

We can now give the proof of the first main theorem from the introduction.
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Given a k-dga A, we apply Theorem 3.4 to obtain a kprojective E1 -resolution B → A. Then B satisfies the assumptions of Proposition
4.7, which provides an E2 -equivalence E → B. The composition E → A is the
desired minimal dA∞ -algebra model.
The resolution B → A is well defined up to E2 -equivalence of k-projective E1 resolutions. Given such an E2 -equivalence B → C, Proposition 4.12 provides an
E2 -equivalence E → F between the associated minimal dA∞ -algebras.

Lemma 3.12 and Proposition 4.12 imply
Corollary 4.13. Minimal dA∞ -algebra models of quasi-isomorphic dgas may be
related by a zig-zag of E2 -equivalences between minimal dA∞ -algebras.
Remark 4.14. We do not claim that every termwise k-projective resolution E of
H∗ (A) may be extended to a minimal dA∞ -algebra model for A. We only show
that this happens if E is the vertical homology of a bidga resolving A.

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞ -ALGEBRAS

Remark 4.15. The underlying twisted chain complex of a minimal dA∞ -algebra
model of A is a ‘homological multicomplex resolution’ of the underlying chain complex of A; compare [17].
5. Examples and an application
In this section, we give two examples for minimal dA∞ -algebra structures and
apply our theory to define the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with
a dga.
·p

Example 5.1. Let p be an odd prime, k = Z/p2 , and A the dga (k −→ k). In
Example 3.3, we gave a k-projective E1 -resolution B → A with E := H∗v (B) =
Λ∗k (x, z) ⊗ Γ∗k (y). Following the proof of Proposition 4.7, we now extend the multiplication and dE
1 to a dA∞ -algebra structure on E. A cycle selection map f01 can
be defined by extending
f01 (z) = au, f01 (x) = x, and f01 (y i ) = yi

we can set f02 = 0 and f03 = 0. Since m11 = d1 , we define f11 : E → B[1, −1] by

f11 (yi ) = (v + av)xyi−1 and f11 (x y i ) = (pu − v)yi .
The mE
12 is represented by
B
z12 = f11 mE
02 − m02 (f01 ⊗ f11 + f11 ⊗ f01 ).
E
One calculates z12 = 0, hence mE
12 = 0 and we can set f12 = 0. The m21 is
E
B
represented by z21 = f11 m11 + m11 f11 . One checks
E
mE
21 (y i ) = z y i−1 and m21 (x y i ) = z x y i−1 .

Furthermore, we set f21 (x y i ) = puvxyi−1 and f21 (y i ) = 0. The mE
ij and fij for
i + j ≥ 4 vanish for degree reasons.
Example 5.7 below provides one way to detect that this E encodes non-trivial
information about A, for example the fact that A is not quasi-isomorphic to the
formal dga H∗ (A) with trivial differential. Of course, Theorem 1.2 provides a
different reason this.
The example indicates the general procedure for finding a minimal dA∞ -algebra
model of a given dga A. Since the resolutions provided by Theorem 3.4 are too
large to write down in terms of generators and relations, one has to first guess a kprojective E1 -resolution, for example by lifting a k-projective resolution of H∗ (A)
to a bidga B coming with an E2 -equivalence B → A. Then one can use the
constructive procedure of Proposition 4.7 to build E from B.
Remark 5.2. If k happens to be a field or, more generally, H∗ (A) is k-projective
and the unit k → H0 (A) splits, the minimal model of A as an A∞ -algebra arising
from [11, Theorem 1] is one possible choice for the minimal dA∞ -algebra model of
Theorem 1.1.
Let M be a k-module and let P be a k-projective resolution of M . The endomorphism dga Homk (P, P ) is defined by Homk (P, P )j = Homk (P [j], P ), where the latter denotes maps of graded k-modules. Its differential is dHom
(f ) = dP f −(−1)j f dP .
j
The quasi-isomorphism type of Homk (P, P ) does not depend on the choice of the
resolution P . Its homology algebra is the Yoneda Ext-algebra of M with a sign
shift in the degree, i.e., H∗ Homk (P, P ) = Ext−∗
k (M, M ).
A minimal dA∞ -model for Homk (P, P ) is a resolution E of Ext∗k (M, M ) with
structure maps mE
ij . By Theorem 1.2, this structure enables us to recover the
quasi-isomorphism type of Homk (P, P ).

Example 5.3. Let k = Z, p a prime, and M = Z/p. We will see that the resolution

of Ext∗Z (Z/p, Z/p) given by Z ←− Z in every degree of the Ext-grading is part of a
minimal dA∞ -algebra.
·p
Let P be the two step resolution Z ←− Z of Z/p. The dga A = HomZ (P, P )
may be described as follows (compare [5, §3.1]): Its underlying ungraded algebra
is Mat2 (Z), the algebra of 2 × 2-matrices with entries in Z. Viewing elements of P
as column vectors with top entry the degree 0 part, Mat2 (Z) operates on P . The

Indeed, H∗ (A) is an exterior algebra generated by 00 10 in degree −1.
We give a k-projective E1 -resolution α : B → A. Let B = Mat2 (Z[t] ⊗ Λ∗Z (λ))
with |t| = (0, 0) and |λ| = (1, 0). The horizontal grading is specified through the
generators, and the vertical grading comes from the matrix algebra as above.

Our next aim is to define a variant of derived Hochschild cohomology for graded
k-algebras. It will generalize the Hochschild cohomology of graded k-algebras which
is for example used in [2].
We briefly recall from [1, §4] one way to define the derived Hochschild cohomology
dHH for ungraded k-algebras. (In [1], this theory is called Shukla cohomology.)
Considering an ungraded k-algebra Λ as a N-graded dga concentrated in degree
0, one can find a quasi-isomorphism A → Λ from a degreewise k-projective dga
A. The Hochschild complex of A is the bicomplex C st (A) := Homk (A⊗s , A[t])
with s, t ≥ 0. It has the usual Hochschild differential dHH : C st → C s+1,t and a
differential dHom : C st → C s,t+1 induced from that of A by considering C s∗ as the
Hom-complex with source A⊗s and target A. Letting HH∗ (A) be the cohomology
of the total complex of C st , we define dHH∗ (Λ) := HH∗ (A). This is well defined
since a quasi-isomorphism of k-projective dgas A → A0 over Λ induces a chain of

dqTot : Totqt C(E, F ) → Totq+1 C(E, F ),

c 7→ dHom (c) − (−1)q dHH (c)

The relations of dHH and dHom imply dTot dTot = 0. The graded Hochschild cohomology of E with coefficients in F is the homology of this total complex, i.e.,
HHqt (E, F ) = H q (Tot∗t C(E, F )).
Now let Λ be a graded k-algebra. We view Λ as a k-dga with trivial differential.
Applying vertical homology to the resolution provided by Theorem 3.4, we obtain
a termwise k-projective resolution E → Λ. The resolution is well defined up to
E2 -equivalence between such E. We define the derived Hochschild cohomology of Λ
by
dHHqt (Λ) = HHqt (E, E).
An E2 -equivalence α : E → F of termwise k-projective resolutions induces a chain

If a dga A is formal, i.e., quasi-isomorphic to H∗ (A) with trivial differential,
then γA = 0 since a termwise k-projective resolution of H∗ (A) provides a minimal
dA∞ -algebra model for A with mij = for i + j ≥ 3. Hence a non-vanishing γA
shows that A is not formal, and that a given minimal dA∞ -algebra model of A is
not equivalent to one with trivial higher mij .

Remark 5.5. For a dga over a field, there is a characteristic Hochschild cohomology
class γA ∈ HH3,−1 (H∗ (A)) which is studied in [2]. It is represented by the m3 of
a minimal A∞ -algebra structure on H∗ (A) and determines by evaluation all triple
matric Massey products in H∗ (A). The characteristic dHH-class of a dga over a
commutative ring k given by the previous proposition is the natural generalization.
If k happens to be a field, the γA introduced here coincides with the one from [2],
as one can easily see from Remark 5.2 and [2, Remark 5.8].
If B is a bidga and B → A an E2 -equivalence, B0∗ is a dga, and B → A restricts
to a map B0∗ → A of dgas which induces an surjection in homology. If E is the
minimal dA∞ -algebra structure on H∗v (B), the restriction of mE
03 to H∗ (B0∗ ) is
part of an A∞ -structure on H∗ (B0∗ ). By evaluation, it determines triple Massey
products of B0∗ . Moreover, if λ1 , λ2 , λ3 ∈ H∗ (A) satisfy λ1 λ2 = 0 = λ2 λ3 , we
may lift them to elements of H∗ (B0∗ ), evaluate mE
03 on the lifts, and observe that
the image of the evaluation under the map to H∗ (A) is an element of the Massey
product hλ1 , λ2 , λ3 i. Hence the dHH-class determines all triple (matric) Massey
products in H∗ (A). The difference to the HH-class of [2] is that the dHH-class does
not determine the Massey products in a k-linear fashion, since lifts of elements
along a surjection into a not necessarily projective k-module are involved.
We expect the dHH-class γA of a dga to share more properties with the HH-class
of [2], like the connection to realizability obstructions. We are not going to elaborate
those here. The dHH-class should also be compared to the universal Toda bracket
of a ring spectrum studied in [16]. The latter class is an even further generalization
of the (derived) Hochschild class and arises when one allows the sphere spectrum
of stable homotopy theory as ground ring. This class is an element in a Mac Lane
cohomology group and determines triple Toda brackets.
Remark 5.6. Derived Hochschild cohomology classes associated to dgas also appear in [1] and [4]: a dga A with only A0 and A1 possibly non-zero gives rise
to a crossed extension of H0 (A) by H1 (A) and hence to a cohomology class in
dHH3k (H0 (A), H1 (A)) [1, 4.4.1. Theorem]. More generally, for a dga A with nonnegative homology, its first k-invariant lies in dHH3k (H0 (A), H1 (A)) [4, §4].
If E → A is a minimal dA∞ -algebra model of A, E∗0 is a k-projective resolution
of H0 (A), and there is a restriction map dHHk3,−1 (H∗ (A)) → dHH3k (H0 (A), H1 (A)).
One can check that the image of γA under this map recovers the cohomology classes
described above.
Example 5.7. We continue Example 5.1 by applying Proposition 5.4 to the minimal dA∞ -algebra E described there. In this case, the sum representing γA conE
sists only of mE
21 . The m21 cannot be a boundary in the complex computing the
E
derived Hochschild cohomology: p · mE
11 = 0, while p · m21 is non-zero. Hence
3,−1
γA ∈ dHHZ/p2 (H∗ A) is non-trivial.
This illustrates that the non-triviality of E is a consequence of the information
encoded in the higher degrees of the horizontal grading.
6. Anti-minimal models
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2, which provides an ‘anti-minimal’
model of a dA∞ -algebra. To this end, we introduce modules over dA∞ -algebras
and show that the module category is enriched in twisted chain complexes. For a
dA∞ -algebra E, we thus have an endomorphism tga of the E-module E. Its total
complex is a dga. If E is the minimal dA∞ -algebra model of a dga A, this dga
associated with E recovers the quasi-isomorphism type of A. These constructions
are motivated by the Hom-complex of maps between modules over A∞ -algebras

A map f : M → N of E-modules induces a map of twisted chain complexes
between the underlying twisted chain complexes of M and N . The map f is an
E2 -equivalence if this underlying map is.
Example 6.9. If f : E → F is a map of dA∞ -algebras, both E and F are Emodules, and one can check that f is an E-module map. The underlying twisted
chain complexes of E and F as dA∞ -algebras and modules coincide. Hence f is an
E2 -equivalence of modules if and only if it is an E2 -equivalence of dA∞ -algebras.
Let E be a dA∞ -algebra and let M and N be E-modules. Let X be the bigraded
k-module Homk (SM ⊗ T SE, SN ). For s ∈ N, t ∈ Z, an element of Xst is a kmodule map ge1 : SM ⊗ T SE[s, t] → SN . We shift X by shifting the second entry

Let L, M and N are E-modules. For fe ∈ HomE (M, N )st and ge ∈ HomE (L, M )pq ,
its composite fege ∈ HomE (L, M )p+s,q+t is defined. The unit k → HomE (M, M )
sends 1k to the ge ∈ HomE (M, M ) with ge11 = idSM and gej1 = 0 for j ≥ 2.
Proposition 6.11. The composition induces a pairing of twisted chain complexes
HomE (M, N ) ⊗ HomE (L, M ) → HomE (L, N )
which is associative and unital. In particular, HomE (M, M ) is a tdga.
Proof. Let µ be the composition. The only possibly non-trivial part is to verify the

Remark 6.12. The last proposition says that the category of modules over a
dA∞ -algebra is enriched in twisted chain complexes. The morphisms of the ordinary
category underlying this tChk -category are not the dA∞ -algebra module morphisms
of Definition 6.8. Unlike the case of modules over A∞ -algebras and their enrichment
in chain complexes, not even all components fij of an E-module map f are 0-cycles
in the HomE (M, N ). The reason is that for i ≥ 1, the fij would have to lie in
a negative degree with respect to the first grading. We resist from allowing a
negative grading there, since this would for example cause problems when forming
total complexes. Therefore, the notation Hom might be slightly misleading, but we
keep it in lack of a better alternative. Moreover, the induced maps on HomE (M, N )
to be defined next are not a consequence of the enrichment.

Let E be a dA∞ -algebra. Viewing E as an E-module, HomE (E, E) is an tdga by
Proposition 6.11. We want to define a dA∞ -algebra map ψ E : E → HomE (E, E).

By Lemma 4.3, it is enough to give maps ψeiv

Lemma 6.16. The ψ M,E : M → HomE (E, M ) is a map of twisted chain complexes.
Lemma 6.17. The map ψ M,E of Lemma 6.16 is an E1 -equivalence.

g 1 Ψ1 (η)). The τ is a chain map with

Next we define a chain homotopy between ψ0M,E τ and id on HomE (E, M ). Let
h be the composite SE ⊗ T SE[0, 1] ∼
= Sk ⊗ SE ⊗ T SE → SE ⊗ T SE given by
Sη on Sk and the inclusion SE ⊗ T SE → T SE. We define H : HomE (E, M ) →

HomE (E, M )[0, −1] by H(e
g 1 ) = (−1)heg ,hi ge1 h and calculate
(d0 H + Hd0 )(e

Therefore, ψ M,E induces an isomorphism on homology with respect to d0 .

Corollary 6.19. Let f : E → F be a map of dA∞ -algebras. The induced map
f∗ : HomE (E, E) → HomE (E, F ) is an E2 -equivalence of twisted chain complexes
if and only if f is an E2 -equivalence.
Proof. By Lemma 6.18, the maps induced by f∗ ψ E and ψ E,F f on H∗h H∗v coincide.
Both ψ E and ψ E,F are E1 -equivalences by Lemma 6.17, and hence E2 -equivalences.

Lemma 6.20. Let f : E → F be a dA∞ -algebra map. Then ψ F,E and f ∗ resf ψ F,F
coincide as maps of twisted chain complexes from F to HomE (E, F ).
Proof. One can check that
X

holds for j ≥ 1. This easily implies the assertion.

Corollary 6.21. The map f resf is an E2 -equivalence of twisted chain complexes.
Proposition 6.22. Let f : E → F be an E2 -equivalence of dA∞ -algebras with E2 homology concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Then the dgas Tot HomE (E, E) and
Tot HomF (F, F ) are quasi-isomorphic.
Proof. By the Corollaries 6.19 and 6.21, there is a diagram
f∗

f ∗ resf

HomE (E, E) −→ HomE (E, F ) ←−−−− HomF (F, F )
with both maps E2 -equivalences. Setting
R = Tot HomE (E, E),

S = Tot HomF (F, F ), and

X = Tot HomE (E, F ),

we obtain dgas R and S, an S-R-bimodule X, a quasi-isomorphism α : R → X of
right R-modules and an quasi-isomorphism β : S → X of left S-modules. This data
is compatible with the unit maps in that the square obtained from composing the
unit maps of R and S with α and β commutes.
The described data is almost a ‘quasi-equivalence’ of dgas as described in [12,
p.31] and generalized in [20, Definition A.2.1]. The missing part is an element of X
such that left and right multiplication with the element equals α and β, respectively
(compare Remark 6.12). However, we can follow closely the strategy of the proof of
[20, Lemma A.2.3], exploiting the (projective) model structures on Chk and Mod-R.
We factor α in the model category of right R-modules as a composition of an
∼
/ Y and an acyclic fibration α00 : Y ∼ / / X . We conacyclic cofibration α0 : R /
sider the dga T = HomR (Y, Y ), the T -R-bimodule V = HomR (R, Y ), and the S-T bimodule W = HomR (Y, X). The map α0 induces an acyclic fibration (α0 )∗ : T → V
and a quasi-isomorphism (α0 )∗ : R ∼
= HomR (R, R) → V . The multiplications on R
and T induce an associative and unital multiplication on the pullback P (α0 ) of (α0 )∗
and (α0 )∗ . Hence the induced maps from R → P (α0 ) ← T are maps of dgas. They
are quasi-isomorphisms since (α0 )∗ is an acyclic fibration.
The α00 induces an acyclic fibration (α00 )∗ : T → W since Y is cofibrant as an
R-module. Right multiplication with α00 induces a map S → W . It is a quasi-isomorphism since its composition with the quasi-isomorphism W = HomR (Y, X) →
HomR (R, X) ∼
= X induced by α0 equals β. The latter statement exploits the
compatibility of α and β with the units of R and S. As above, we form the pullback
to get a chain T → P (α00 ) ← S of quasi-isomorphisms.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let E be a dA∞ -algebra. Lemma 2.18 and Proposition
6.11 show that Tot HomE (E, E) is a dga. If A is a dga and E → A an E2 equivalence, Proposition 6.22 implies that Tot HomA (A, A) is quasi-isomorphic to

24

STEFFEN SAGAVE

Tot HomE (E, E). Applying Tot to the E1 -equivalence A → HomA (A, A) and observing A ∼

= Tot A completes the proof.
Over a field, every A∞ -algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a dga. However, not
every dA∞ -algebra E is E2 -equivalent to a dga, since E may have E2 -homology in
horizontal degrees other than 0. From this perspective, the relation of dgas and
dA∞ -algebras is more like viewing ordinary modules as (positive) chain complexes
concentrated in degree 0.
