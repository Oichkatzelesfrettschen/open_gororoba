                   Population of Merging Compact Binaries Inferred Using Gravitational

                    We report on the population properties of compact binary mergers inferred from gravitational-wave
                 observations of these systems during the first three LIGO-Virgo observing runs. The Gravitational-Wave
                 Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3) contains signals consistent with three classes of binary mergers: binary
                 black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star–black hole mergers. We infer the binary neutron star
                 merger rate to be between 10 and 1700 Gpc−3 yr−1 and the neutron star–black hole merger rate to be
                 between 7.8 and 140 Gpc−3 yr−1 , assuming a constant rate density in the comoving frame and taking the
                 union of 90% credible intervals for methods used in this work. We infer the binary black hole merger rate,
                 allowing for evolution with redshift, to be between 17.9 and 44 Gpc−3 yr−1 at a fiducial redshift (z ¼ 0.2).
                 The rate of binary black hole mergers is observed to increase with redshift at a rate proportional to ð1 þ zÞκ
                 with κ ¼ 2.9þ1.7
                               −1.8 for z ≲ 1. Using both binary neutron star and neutron star–black hole binaries, we obtain a
                                                                                            þ0.1

                                                                                                        −0.3 M ⊙ . We confidently
                 determine that the merger rate as a function of mass sharply declines after the expected maximum neutron
                 star mass, but cannot yet confirm or rule out the existence of a lower mass gap between neutron stars and
                 black holes. We also find the binary black hole mass distribution has localized over- and underdensities
                 relative to a power-law distribution, with peaks emerging at chirp masses of 8.3þ0.3              þ1.9
                                                                                                    −0.5 and 27.9−1.8 M ⊙ . While
                 we continue to find that the mass distribution of a binary’s more massive component strongly decreases as a
                 function of primary mass, we observe no evidence of a strongly suppressed merger rate above
                 approximately 60M ⊙, which would indicate the presence of a upper mass gap. Observed black hole
                 spins are small, with half of spin magnitudes below χ i ≈ 0.25. While the majority of spins are preferentially
                 aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we infer evidence of antialigned spins among the binary
                 population. We observe an increase in spin magnitude for systems with more unequal-mass ratio. We also
                 observe evidence of misalignment of spins relative to the orbital angular momentum.

TABLE I. A table of GW events that meet the criteria for inclusion in this work. Events are separated by a horizontal line into sections
of FARmin < 0.25 yr−1 and FARmin ≥ 0.25 yr−1 (lower), where FARmin is the smallest FAR reported over all pipelines. Within these
sections, events are listed by the date they were detected. Columns provide the FAR, pastro (from the pipeline with the smallest FAR), and
previously reported estimates of selected parameters; see Appendix E for discussion of how these estimates could be reassessed when
adopting the results of this work. Events with at least one low-mass component are classified as BNSs or NSBHs following the analysis
described in Sec. V. The low-significance event GW190531 is not included, lacking parameter inferences.

TABLE II. Merger rates in Gpc−3 yr−1 for the various mass bins, assuming merger rates per unit comoving volume are redshift
independent. BNS, NSBH, and BBH regions are based solely upon component masses, with the split between the NS and BH taken to
be 2.5M ⊙ . We also provide rates for binaries with one component in the purported mass gap between 2.5 and 5M ⊙ . For all but the last
row, merger rates are quoted at the 90% credible interval. For the last row, we provide the union of 90% credible intervals for the
preceding three rows, as our most conservative realistic estimate of the merger rate for each class accounting for model systematics.
The PDB (pair) model is distinct from the other three models due to its use of a pairing function [161] and is therefore excluded from the
union of credible intervals in the final row. In Sec. VI we estimate the merger rate for BBHs alone, accounting for variation in merger rate
versus redshift.

   Likewise, for binaries containing objects between 2.5
and 5M ⊙ and having NS-scale companions, the merger rate
is marginally informed by a few events that may not be
associated with this region (i.e., GW200115), exacerbating
uncertainty in the inferred NS and BH mass distributions.
Providing multiple results for these two source classes
explores systematic uncertainty due to potential model
misspecification. The models presented in this section are
subject to different sources of systematic uncertainty. For
example, MS employs a Gaussian distribution to model
components in BNSs, whereas PDB uses a single power
law with a sharp turn-on at low masses to model all objects
below the inferred lower edge of the mass gap. These
differences result in considerably different BNS rates due
to the limited number of detections in the NS mass range.
In particular, differences in the pairing function shift the
rate inference and add statistical uncertainty in the BNS
region. MS and PDB (pair) both assume independent              FIG. 5. Differential merger rate as a function of component

of tidal deformability, the gravitational-wave data do not
identify which sources contain a NS. Nonetheless, we can
establish whether their components are consistent with NSs
by comparing their masses to the maximum NS mass,
Mmax , following the method described in Ref. [68].
   The precise value of M max is unknown because of
uncertainty in the NS EOS. Mass measurements for the
heaviest known pulsars [182,183] set a lower bound of
approximately 2M ⊙ on Mmax , while basic causality con-
siderations imply that Mmax ≲ 3M ⊙ [184,185]. While
individual nuclear theory models for the EOS can produce
maximum masses as large as approximately 3M⊙, astro-
physical inferences of the EOS generally predict that the
maximum mass of a nonrotating NS, the TOV mass
Mmax;TOV , is between 2.2 and 2.5M ⊙ [21–25]. Similarly,
studies of GW170817’s merger remnant suggest that
Mmax;TOV ≲ 2.3M ⊙ [174–179]. Rapid rotation can sustain
a maximum mass up to approximately 20% larger than
Mmax;TOV [186]. However, the astrophysical processes that
form compact binaries may prevent the EOS-supported
Mmax from being realized in the population; see, e.g.,

marginalizing over statistical uncertainties and assuming a
uniform component mass prior. We adopt a threshold
probability of 50% for classification as a NS. Our fiducial
maximum NS mass estimate is taken to be Mmax;TOV
from an EOS inference which is based on pulsar timing,
gravitational-wave and x-ray observations of NSs [25].
That study finds Mmax;TOV ¼ 2.21þ0.40−0.18 M ⊙ , and the corre-
sponding posterior distribution is shown for comparison in
Fig. 6 (previous EOS inference [25] quoted the highest-
posterior-density interval of 2.00–2.52M⊙ , while we quote

at least one component, and we deem them either BNSs if
m1 < M max;TOV or NSBHs if only m2 < Mmax;TOV. The
fifth event, GW190814, has Pðm < M max;TOV Þ ¼ 0.06 and
is therefore classified as a BBH. These source classifica-
tions do not change if, instead of Mmax;TOV , we compare
against the rotating NS maximum mass, Mmax ðχÞ, as

model. Solid curves are the medians and the colored bands are the 90% credible intervals. These models offer increased flexibility
compared to phenomenological models in predicting the population. The PS applies a perturbation to the primary mass in a modified
version of our fiducial PP model that does not include the Gaussian peak. FM models the chirp mass, mass ratio, and aligned-spin
distribution as a weighted sum of mixture components. Both of these models incorporate a single-parameter redshift evolution of the
merger rate described in Eq. (7). The BGP models the two-dimensional mass distribution as a binned Gaussian process which is
