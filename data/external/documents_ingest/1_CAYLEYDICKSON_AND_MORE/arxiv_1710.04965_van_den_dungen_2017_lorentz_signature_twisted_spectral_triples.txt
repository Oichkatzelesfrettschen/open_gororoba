                                                    We show how twisting the spectral triple of the Standard Model of elementary particles
                                                naturally yields the Krein space associated with the Lorentzian signature of spacetime. We
                                                discuss the associated spectral action, both for fermions and bosons. What emerges is a tight

                                          1    Introduction
                                          Noncommutative differential geometry (NCG) provides a unified framework from which to de-
                                          scribe both Einstein-Hilbert gravity (in Euclidean signature) and classical gauge theories [1]. In
                                          particular, it gives an elegant description of the full Standard Model of particle physics in all of
                                          its detail, including the Higgs mechanism and neutrino mixing, as gravity on a certain “almost
                                          commutative manifold” [2, 3]. A recent and comprehensive review can be found in [4].
                                               The main benefit of the NCG approach to physics is that it offers a more constrained de-
                                          scription of gauge theories than the usual effective field theory approach. Indeed, the added
                                          geometric constraints impose a range of successful and phenomenologically accurate restrictions
                                          on the allowed particle content of the Standard Model of particle physics [5–8]. Despite this suc-
                                          cess, an early estimate for the Higgs mass was also furnished at mH ≃ 170 Gev. This prediction
                                          was disfavored by the Tevatron data, and has since been ruled out by the LHC [9, 10]. While
                                          falling short of an accurate comparison with experiment, this prediction depended on a number
                                          of assumptions including the big desert hypothesis, as well as the presence of a scale at which
                                          the coupling constants of the three gauge interactions unify.
                                               In light of the many successes of the NCG construction, one is led to question the various
                                          assumptions that went into the incorrect Higgs mass calculation, and above all the validity of
                                          the big desert assumption. This concern is particularly pressing as the “low” experimental value
                                          detected for the Higgs mass causes an instability (or meta-stability) in the electroweak vacuum
                                          at intermediate energies (see [11] for a recent update), that may be cured by the addition of a
                                          new scalar field suitably coupled to the Higgs - usually denoted σ (e.g. [12,13]). If the addition of
                                          such a scalar field were admissible within the NCG construction, it would not only stabilize the

electroweak vacuum, but also allow compatibility with the experimentally observed Higgs mass
[14]. Such an outcome is difficult to achieve however as the extra geometric constraints imposed
by the NCG formalism severely restrict any allowed addition to the Standard Model. Early
attempts in [15,16] to generate an extra scalar field within the framework required the adjunction
of new fermions. More recently, there have been a number of phenomenologically viable Standard
Model extensions singled out by the NCG framework which preserve the fermionic sector. This
has been achieved for example in [17, 18] by relaxing some of the geometrical constraints, and
in [19] by taking full account of the outer symmetries of the model (let us also mention some
proposals to modify the grading, based on Morita equivalence, developed in [20, 21], as well as
other modification of the grading in [22]).
     In this paper we are mostly concerned with the outcome of an extension of the Standard Model
known as grand symmetry, proposed in [23] (see [24] for a shorter non-technical presentation). It
relies on an enlargement of the Standard Model algebra, and ultimately allows one to obtain the
field σ in agreement with the NCG principles, namely as an internal part of a connection. As
shown in [25] however, in order to make the grand symmetry extension work, one is required to
twist the noncommutative geometry of the Standard Model, in the sense of Connes-Moscovici [26].
Besides solving some technical difficulties, the twist also permits one to understand the breaking
of the grand symmetry down to the Standard Model symmetries in a dynamical process induced
by the spectral action. Our first result establishes the fact that the required twist corresponds to
a Wick rotation. More precisely, we show in section 3 that the twist turns the inner product of
the Hilbert space of (Euclidean) spinors into a Krein product. The latter is precisely the inner
product associated with spinors on a Lorentzian manifold. In a sense made precise in §3.2, the
twist is actually the square of the Wick rotation.
     Our second result concerns the spectral action in the twisted context. While the behavior
of gauge transformations for twisted spectral triples has already been worked out in [27], the
corresponding gauge invariance of the spectral action has not yet been addressed. We investigate
this question in section 4:

   • We begin with the fermionic action S F in §4.1, showing that the straightforward adaptation
     to the twisted case of the usual formula is indeed invariant under a twisted gauge transfor-
     mation. However, it is not antisymmetric when restricted to the (positive) eigenvectors of
     the chirality operator, unlike the non-twisted case. This leads us to propose two possible
     definitions of S F in the twisted context: either by restricting to the eigenvectors of the uni-
     tary implementing the twist, or by considering a Dirac operator, which is Krein-hermitian
     rather than hermitian.

   • The bosonic action S B is adressed in §4.2. We show that there is an easy way to rewrite
     it so that it becomes invariant under a twisted gauge transformation. We also investigate
     the possibility of a Krein adjoint Dirac operator. In both cases, our formulas give back the
     Euclidean bosonic action.

The picture that emerges is that twisted geometries may provide an appropriate framework from
which to facilitate the description of non-Euclidean signatures in NCG.
    We begin in the following section by recalling the main feature of the twisted spectral triple
of the Standard Model.

2       Twisted spectral geometry for the standard model
This section deals with the twisted spectral triple of the Standard Model of [25]. We do not
discuss the usual non-twisted version, which can be found in [3]; neither do we motivate the
importance of twists in noncommutative geometry. Let us just recall that twisted spectral triples
were introduced in [26] in order to build spectral triples from algebras which do not exhibit a
trace. Quite unexpectedly, they also provide the correct mathematical framework to write the
“beyond SM” Grand symmetry model of [23].
    A twisted spectral triple (A, H, D; ρ) consists of a *-algebra A of bounded operators in a
Hilbert space∗ H, together with a non-necessarily bounded self-adjoint operator D on H with
compact resolvent, and an automorphism ρ of A such that the twisted commutator

                                         [D, a]ρ := Da − ρ(a)D                                        (2.1)

is bounded for any a in A. The twisted spectral triple is even if there is a Z2 grading, i.e. an
operator Γ on H, Γ = Γ† , Γ2 = 1, such that ΓD + DΓ = 0 and Γa − aΓ = 0 for any a ∈ A. It is
real if there is an antilinear isometry J (called real structure) which satisfies

                                 J 2 = ǫI,   JD = ǫ′ DJ,     JΓ = ǫ′′ ΓJ                              (2.2)

where ǫ, ǫ′ , ǫ′′ ∈ {1, −1} define the KO-dimension (see e.g. [28] for details).
    The real structure implements an action of the opposite algebra† A◦ , obtained by identifying
Jb∗ J −1 with b◦ ∈ A◦ (for any b ∈ A), which is asked to commute with A:

                                      [a, JbJ −1 ] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.                                    (2.3)

This is called the order zero condition and it permits one to define a right action of A on H

                                   ψa := a◦ ψ = Ja∗ J −1 ψ     ∀ψ ∈ H.                                (2.4)

Another condition that plays an important role is the order one condition [29], which for twisted
spectral triples one writes as [25, 30]

                                   [[D, a]ρ , JbJ −1 ]ρ0 = 0 ∀a, b ∈ A,                               (2.5)

where‡
                                        ρ0 (JbJ −1 ) := Jρ(b)J −1 .                                   (2.6)

The usual conditions for untwisted spectral triples are retrieved by taking ρ to be the identity
automorphism ρ(a) = a.
   A gauge theory is described - in its non twisted version - by an almost commutative geometry,
that is the product

                A = C ∞ (M) ⊗ AF , H = L2 (M, S) ⊗ HF , D = ∂/ ⊗ IF + γE ⊗ DF                         (2.7)

     We denote T † the adjoint of an operator T on H. As usual, we omit the symbol of representation for the
algebra and identify π(a∗ ) = π(a)† with a∗ .

     Identical to A as a vector space, but with reversed product: a◦ b◦ = (ba)◦ .

      ρ0 is the “natural” image of ρ in the automorphism group of A◦ : ρ◦ (b◦ ) = (ρ(b))◦ .

where HR = C8 × C3 is spanned by the N = 3 generations of 8 right-handed fermions (electron,
neutrino, up and down quarks with three colors each), HL stands for left fermions, and the

whose entries are the Yukawa couplings of fermions, the Dirac and Majorana masses of neutrinos,

    The fermionic fields are elements of the Hilbert space H. The bosonic fields are obtained by

Remark 2.1. The twisted fluctuations of the Dirac operator, which were initially introduced by
analogy with the non twisted case [25], have now in [27] been placed on the same rigorous footing
as Connes’ original “fluctuations of the metric” [29], namely as a way to export a real twisted
spectral triple to a Morita equivalent algebra. In particular, in case of self-Morita equivalence, one
obtains formula (2.19). Additionally, a gauge transformation is implemented as in the non-twisted
case, namely as a change of connection in the bimodule that implements Morita equivalence. This
yields formula (2.25), which is our starting point in this paper.
    Note however, that there is an important difference between the twisted and the non-twisted
cases: while usual fluctuations preserve the selfadjointness of the Dirac operator, twisted-fluctuations
may not. In [27] this issue was addressed working out the necessary and sufficient conditions,
such that the unitary u which implements the twisting automorphism (in case the latter lifts to
an inner automorphism of B(H)) must satisfy in order to preserve selfadjointness. Interestingly,
there are other solutions beyond the obvious ones (i.e. u invariant under the twist).
    In this paper we provide an alternative solution: instead of trying to preserve selfadjointness,
we investigate whether there is a “more natural” property preserved under a twisted fluctuation.
We find one: selfadjointness with respect to the inner product induced by the twist. Unexpectedly,
in the case of the twisted spectral triple of the Standard Model, the induced product is the Krein
product of Lorentz spinors. It is quite remarkable that the Lorentz structure emerges from the
algebraic properties of the Euclidean spectral triple and its twist (all the more that the later is
unique, under the condition that the fermionic sector of the theory is untouched by the twist [27]).


                                                  5
    When DAρ is selfadjoint, we call it a twisted-covariant Dirac operator. One then shows
[25] that (A, H, DAρ ; ρ) is a real twisted spectral triple, with the same real structure and KO-
dimension as (A, H, D; ρ).
    A gauge transformation for a twisted spectral triple [27] is implemented by the simultaneous
action on H and L(H) (the space of linear operators on H) of the group of unitaries of A,

                                 U (A) := {u ∈ A, u∗ u = uu∗ = I} .                             (2.21)

The action on H follows from the adjoint action of A (on the left via its representation, on the
right by (2.4)), that is

                        Ad(u)ψ = uψu∗ = uJuJ −1 ψ        ∀ψ ∈ H, u ∈ U (A).                     (2.22)

The action on L(H) is defined as

                             T 7→ Ad(ρ(u)) T Ad(u∗ )        ∀T ∈ L(H),                          (2.23)

where
                                     Ad(ρ(u)) = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J −1 .                                 (2.24)

In particular, for T = DAρ a twisted covariant Dirac operator (2.19), one has (see details in
appendice, and also [27])
                               Ad(ρ(u)) DAρ Ad(u∗ ) = DAuρ                            (2.25)

where
                                  Auρ := ρ(u)Aρ u∗ + ρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ .                           (2.26)

The map Aρ 7→ Auρ is a twisted version of the usual law of transformation of the gauge potential
in noncommutative geometry [29].

    The interest of twisting the spectral triple of the Standard Model is that whereas the part
DR of the operator DF that contains the Yukawa coupling kR of the right handed neutrino is
transparent to usual inner fluctuations,

                                       [DR , a] = 0 ∀a ∈ AF ,                                   (2.27)

it is not transparent to twisted inner fluctuations (2.19),

                               [DR , a]ρ 6= 0   for some a ∈ AF ⊗ C2 .                          (2.28)

That DR did not fluctuate remained almost unnoticed until the observation in [14] that turning
the (constant) kR into a field kR σ provides precisely the extra scalar field required to stabilize the
electroweak vacuum, and also provides a way of naturally accommodating the mass of the Higgs
boson. The non-fluctuation of DR by internal symmetries can be traced back to the first-order
condition (as already noticed in [32]). To justify the substitution kR → kR σ, various solutions
have been proposed:

    - Make the first-order condition more flexible, as investigated in [17, 18], with phenomeno-
      logical consequences in [33] (see also [34]).

                                                   6
      - Attempt to fluctuate the σ field using the outer symmetries of the theory, as initiated
        in [19], leading to a minimal and phenomenologically viable Standard Model extension.

      - Double the algebra and twist the first order condition, as explained above.


3      Twist and Lorentz Structure
We show that when the automorphism ρ in a twisted spectral triple (A, H, D; ρ) is inner, then
there exists a natural ρ-twisted inner product on H. Furthermore, for the twisted geometry of
the Standard Model (2.7), this inner-product is a Krein product of Lorentzian spinors.

3.1     Twisted inner product
Let H be an Hilbert space with inner product h·, ·i, and ρ be an automorphism of B(H).

Definition 3.1. A ρ-twisted inner product h·, ·iρ is an inner product on H such that

                       hΨ, OΦiρ = hρ(O)† Ψ, Φiρ          ∀O ∈ B(H), Ψ, Φ ∈ H,                  (3.1)

where ρ(O)† is the adjoint of ρ(O) with respect to the initial Hilbert inner product h·, ·i.

We denote
                                                O+ := ρ(O)†                                    (3.2)

the adjoint of a bounded operator O with respect to the ρ-twisted inner product. For short we
call the later the ρ-product, and O+ the ρ-adjoint of O. An operator O (resp. U ) on H is said
ρ−hermitian (ρ−unitary) if it is selfadjoint (unitary) with respect to the ρ-product: O+ = O,
U + U = U U + = I. In terms of the initial Hilbert product on H, this reads

                                  O = ρ(O)† ,    ρ(U )† U = U ρ(U )† = I.                      (3.3)

    If ρ is an inner automorphism of B(H), such that there exists a unitary operator R on H
satisfying
                                ρ(O) = ROR†      ∀O ∈ B(H),                             (3.4)

then a natural ρ-product is
                                       hΨ, Φiρ = hΨ, RΦi = hR† Ψ, Φi.                          (3.5)

Indeed, for any bounded operator O on H one checks that

             hΨ, OΦiρ = hΨ, ROΦi = hO† R† Ψ, Φi = hO† R† Ψ, R† RΦi                             (3.6)
                              †    †                †                   †       +
                       = hRO R Ψ, RΦi = hρ(O )Ψ, Φiρ = hρ(O) Ψ, Φiρ = hO Ψ, Φiρ                (3.7)

where we used that an inner automorphism is necessarily a ∗ -automorphism, that is

                                  ρ(O)† = (ROR† )† = RO† R† = ρ(O† ).                          (3.8)

Notice that R is both unitary (by definition) and ρ-unitary: one has ρ(R) = RRR† = R so that
ρ(R)† R = R† R = I = R ρ(R)† .


                                                     7
   All the definitions above extend to any (i.e. non necessarily bounded) densely defined linear
operator T on H whose domain is globally invariant under left multiplication by R† : if R† ψ ∈
Dom(T ) for any ψ ∈ Dom(T ), then one defines the action of ρ on T as

                                        ρ(T )Ψ := R T R† Ψ.                                     (3.9)

    If in addition T is adjointable (i.e. the operator T † defined by hT † η, ξi := hη, T ξi for all
ξ ∈ Dom(T ), is densely defined), then so is RT R† and by (3.2) one defines the ρ-adjoint of T as
T + := ρ(T )† . The operator T is ρ-hermitian when T + = T .
    The extension of an inner automorphism a → uau∗ of A to an automorphism of B(H) is not
unique (just consider two distinct unitaries R1 , R2 in B(H) such that R1 aR1† = R2 aR2† for any
a ∈ A). Any such extension defines an automorphism of A◦ :

                               ρ(Ja∗ J −1 ) = R Ja∗ J −1 R†   ∀a ∈ A.                         (3.10)

We say that an inner automorphism is compatible with J if it admits an extension such that
(3.10) agrees with ρ◦ ∈ Aut(A◦ ) defined in (2.6). More precisely:

Definition 3.2. Given a real spectral triple (A, H, D), an inner automorphism ρ of A is com-
patible with the real structure J if there exists a unitary R ∈ B(H) such that

                ρ(a) = RaR†      and     J R a∗ R† J −1 = RJa∗ J −1 R†     ∀a ∈ A.            (3.11)

This condition is verified in particular when the inner automorphism can be implemented by a
unitary R such that

                                            JR = ±RJ.                                         (3.12)

3.2   Lorentzian signature and Krein space
In definition 3.1 we do not require the ρ-product to be positive definite. Since R is unitary, one
has that h·, ·iρ is non-degenerate. If in addition we impose that R is selfadjoint and different
from the identity (i.e. the automorphism ρ is not the trivial one), then R has eigenvalues ±1.
The two corresponding eigenspaces H+ , H− are such that H = H+ ⊕ H− and the ρ-product is
positive definite on H+ , negative definite on H− . In other words, a space H equipped with the
product h·, ·iρ is a Krein space. Furthermore, the operator R is a fundamental symmetry, that
is it satisfies R2 = I and the inner product h·, R·iρ is positive definite on H (in our case, this is
simply the Hilbert product one started with).
     In the twisted spectral triple of the Standard Model, the automorphism ρ is the flip (2.15).
It is implemented on L2 (M, S) by the adjoint action of the selfadjoint unitary operator
                                                        !
                                                 0 12
                                           R=             .                                   (3.13)
                                                 12 0

This matrix has eingenvalues ±1, hence H equipped with the ρ-product is a Krein space. The

Euclidean Dirac matrices in the chiral basis are, for µ = 0, j with j = 1, 2, 3,
                                  !
                          0   σ µ
                 µ

                γE =        µ                                                               (3.14)
                         σ̃    0

                                                                      0 and the ρ-product (3.1) is
where σj , j = 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices. Thus R is nothing but γE
now the usual inner product of quantum field theory in Lorentz signature, where instead of ψ †
it appears ψ̄ = ψ † γE0:

                                                ˆ               ˆ
                                          0
                           hψ, φiρ = hψ, γE φi = d4 xψ † γE
                                                          0
                                                            φ := d4 xψ̄φ.                  (3.15)

   Furthermore, one has

                            0       0 3    0          j      0 j 0       j
                         ρ(γE ) = (γE ) = γE ,     ρ(γE ) = γE γE γE = −γE .                (3.16)

The twist therefore performs some sort of Wick rotation whereby the sign of the time-component
Dirac matrix is changed with respect to the spatial directions. The matrix R is of course expressed
in a particular basis, and its action on the Clifford algebra generated by the γ’s singles out one
particular direction, which we identify with time. Then it makes sense to define the integral on a
time slice and have fields normalized only for the space integral, which is what is commonly done.
However, the ρ(γE i )’s are not the Lorentzian signature (i.e. Minkowskian) gamma matrices,


                                0    0        j     j
                               γM = γE ,     γM = iγE        j = 1, 2, 3.                   (3.17)
                                                µ    µ
Viewing the Wick rotation as the operator: W : γE → γM , that is

                                      0      0             j       j
                                  W (γE ) = γE ,       W (γE ) = iγE ,                      (3.18)

one has that the twist (3.16) is the square of the Wick rotation

                              0            0              j            j
                           ρ(γE ) = W (W (γE )),       ρ(γE ) = W (W (γE )).                (3.19)

    The Euclidean Dirac matrices are selfadjoint for the Hilbert product of L2 (M, S), but (except
     0 ) not ρ-hermitian since from (3.2) and (3.16) one has
for γE

                                       j +      j †     j        †
                                     (γE ) = ρ(γE ) = −γE .                                 (3.20)

On the contrary, the Minkowskian gamma matrices (except γM 0 ) are not selfadjoint for the Hilbert
                              j †     j
product since (3.17) yields (γM ) = −γM ; but they are ρ-hermitian since
                                    j         j        j     j
                                 ρ(γM ) = iρ(γE ) = −iγE = −γM ,                            (3.21)

so that
            j +      j †        j              j †           j          j      j
          (γM ) = ρ(γM ) = (γ0 γM γ0 )† = γ0 (γM ) γ0 = −γ0 γM γ0 = −ρ(γM ) = γM .          (3.22)

The “temporal” gamma matrix γ 0 := γE
                                    0 = γ 0 is both selfadjoint and ρ-hermitian.

    The twist naturally defines a Krein structure, while maintaining in the background the Eu-
clidean structure. Applications of Krein spaces to noncommutative geometry framework have
been recently studied in [35, 36] as well as in [37–39] (see reference therein for earlier attempts
of adapting Connes noncommutative geometry to the Minkowskian signature).

Remark 3.3. Wick rotations are a delicate issue in the presence of fermions, and have been dis-
cussed in detail in [40] (see also [41]). There are intimate relations with the projection necessary
to remove the extra degrees of freedom given by fermion doubling [42]. In the present paper we
concentrate on the issue of the change of signature, and how it relates with the twist. The tran-
sition from an Euclidean signature theory which contains fermions involves changes of degrees of
freedom, usually a doubling, as occurred for example in [43, 44]. In the present approach there is
actually a quadruplication of degrees of freedom, obtained as a product of two duplications. One
of these disappears after Wick rotation, while the other must be projected out. The nature of the
duplications seen in this work differ slightly from those cited above.


4    Actions
For an almost commutative geometry (2.7) with grading Γ, the fermionic action is [3]

                                       S F (D) := hJ ψ̃, D ψ̃i                                 (4.1)

where ψ is a vector in the even part of the Hilbert space

                                     He := {ψ ∈ H, γψ = ψ}                                     (4.2)

which, seen as an operator on the Fock space, is a Grassmanian variable ψ̃. The bosonic action
is [2]                                               2
                                     B               D
                                    S (D) := Tr f                                        (4.3)
                                                     Λ2
where Λ is an energy cutoff and f a smooth approximation of the characteristic function of
the interval [0, 1]. Both actions are invariant under a gauge transformation [3], that is the
simultaneous transformation

                          D 7→ Ad(u) D Ad(u∗ )        and   ψ 7−→ Ad(u)ψ.                      (4.4)

For the almost commutative geometry (2.7) with M a Riemannian spin manifold and (AF , HF , DF )
as described in §2, S F yields the fermionic action of the Standard Model, while the asymptotic
expansion of S B yields the bosonic part, including the Higgs, together with the Einstein-Hilbert
action (in Euclidean signature) and an extra Weyl term.
    For a twisted spectral triple, both actions (4.1) and (4.3) are well defined, but their invari-
ance under a gauge transformation, that is - as explained at the end of §2 - the simultaneous
transformation

                     D 7→ DAuρ := Ad(ρ(u)) D Ad(u∗ )        and   ψ 7−→ Ad(u)ψ,                (4.5)

is not guaranteed:


                                                 10
   • S F (D) has no reason to be invariant, unless u is invariant under the twist: u = ρ(u);

   • SB (DAuρ ) is defined only if DAuρ is selfadjoint, or at least normal (which guarantees that
        2 
         DAu
            ρ
     f    Λ      makes sense by the spectral theorem). But as has already been discussed in
      remark 2.1, for an arbitrary unitary u, the operator DAuρ has no reason to be selfadjoint,
      nor even normal. Notice however that it has compact resolvent, being a perturbation by
      bounded operator of the selfadjoint compact-resolvent operator D. Thus as soon as it is
      normal, the trace in (4.3) is finite for any value of the cutoff Λ and the bosonic action
      S B (DAuρ ) is then well defined.

    So as to ensure that both the fermionic and bosonic actions remain well defined and invariant
under gauge transformations, one may restrict the range of acceptable unitaries to those such
that (4.1) is invariant under (4.4) and such that DAuρ is normal. It is likely however that there
is no other solution other than the unitaries invariant under the twist, which would drastically
limit the interest of the whole construction: why introducing a twist only to ignore it at the
end? Another solution, and the one that we explore in the following, is to take advantage of
the twisted inner product (3.5) so as to modify the definitions of S F and S B , in order to obtain
actions invariant under (4.5) for any unitary u.

4.1   Fermionic Action
To build a fermionic action for a twisted spectral triple that is invariant under the gauge trans-
formation (4.5), it suffices to substitute the Hilbert inner product in (4.1) with the ρ-product.

Proposition 4.1. Let (A, H, D; ρ) be a real twisted spectral triple with ρ an inner automorphism
of B(H) compatible with the real structure in the sense of Def. 3.2. Then

                               AρD (ψ, φ) = hJψ, Dφiρ     ∀ψ, φ ∈ Dom D                        (4.6)

is a bilinear form invariant under the simultaneous transformations of (4.5). That is

            AρD (ψ, φ) = AρAd(ρ(u)) D Ad(u∗ ) (Ad(u)ψ, Ad(u)φ)   ∀ψ, φ ∈ Dom D, u ∈ U (A).     (4.7)

Proof. One simply adapts to the twisted case the proof of [28, Prop. 1.213]. The Hilbert
product on H is antilinear on the first variable, and the same is true for the ρ-product. Since J
is antilinear, one has that AρD (·, ·) is linear in both variables.
    Let U = Ad(u) = uJuJ −1 . By (3.11) one has

                 Ad(ρ(u)) = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J −1 = ρ(u)ρ(JuJ −1 ) = ρ(uJuJ −1 ) = ρ(U ).              (4.8)

Therefore

                  Aρρ(U )DU ∗ (U ψ, U φ) = hJU ψ, ρ(U )DU ∗ U φiρ = hU Jψ, ρ(U )Dφiρ           (4.9)
                                                 +
                                       = hJψ, U ρ(U )Dφiρ = hJψ, Dφiρ                        (4.10)




                                                     11
where in the first line we have used the fact that J commutes with U ,

     JU = J(uJuJ −1 ) = JJuJ −1 u = ǫ′′ u(JJ −1 )J −1 u = ǫ′′ uJ(J −1 )2 u = uJu = U J,       (4.11)

and the last line comes from (3.2):

                                        U + ρ(U ) = ρ(U )∗ ρ(U ) = I.                         (4.12)

This proves the result.                                                                            

    In the (usual) description of the Standard Model with a (non twisted) spectral triple, it is
important for the bilinear form hJφ, Dψi to be antisymmetric, hJφ, Dψi = −hJψ, Dφi, and
not to vanish when restricted to the even part (4.2) of the Hilbert space. This makes S F in
(4.1) vanishing if computed with usual spinors, but gives the expected fermionic action when
computed with Grassman fermionic fields. One restricts to He in order to solve the fermion
doubling problem (see [28, I.§16.2] for details). In the twisted case, the bilinear form (4.6) is not
necessarily antisymmetric. It is however, if one restricts to

                                      HR := {ψ ∈ Dom D, Rψ = ψ} .                             (4.13)

Proposition 4.2. Let (A, H, D; ρ) be a real twisted spectral triple for which ρ is compatible with
the real structure in the sense of (3.12). Then the bilinear form AρD is such that

                                  AρD (ψ, φ) = ǫǫ′ AρD (φ, ψ)   ∀ψ, φ ∈ HR .                  (4.14)

Proof. By definition of antiunitary operator, hJφ, Jψi = hφ, ψi for any ψ, φ ∈ H. Thus

                       AρD (ψ, φ) = hJψ, RDφi = ǫhJψ, J 2 RDφi = ǫhJRDφ, ψi.                  (4.15)

Let JR = ǫ′′′ RJ, where ǫ′′′ = ±1. For ψ, φ in HR , one obtains

    AρD (ψ, φ) = ǫǫ′′′ hRJDφ, ψi = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ hRDJφ, ψi = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ hJφ, DR† ψi,                 (4.16)

              = ǫǫ ǫ       hJR Rφ, Dψi = ǫǫ hR JRφ, Dψi = ǫǫ hJφ, RDψi = ǫǫ AρD (φ, ψ).

                                                                                              (4.17)

where in the second line we use R† R = I and R† ψ = ψ, then R† J = ǫ′′′ JR† .                      

The twisted spectral triple of the Standard Model presented in §2 has KO-dimension 2, with
a twist R = γE 0 compatible with the real structure. Hence the above proposition applies with

ǫ = −1, ǫ′ = 1, meaning that AρD is antisymmetric as expected.
    Formally, the twisted fermionic action (4.6) is similar to the non twisted one (4.1): it is
gauge invariant and symmetric on a given subspace of H. However this subspace is HR , not He .
This may have some consequences on the physical contents of the action, the study of which we
leave to future work, as it will require first to compute the twisted fluctuations of the full Dirac
operator D in (2.7) (in [25] was considered only the part DR of DF that contain the Yukawa
coupling of the right handed neutrino).
    Alternatively, the Krein structure induced by the twist suggests a way to define a fermionic
action which is antisymmetric on the whole of H: instead of restricting to ψ ∈ HR , the alternative


                                                      12
is to assume that D is ρ-hermitian. This goes beyond the definition of twisted spectral triples
(which deals only with selfadjoint operator D). However, there exists several proposals for
generalizing spectral triples to the Lorentzian signature (see [35] for the most recent one, and
references therein). We do not intend to develop here a theory of Lorentzian twisted spectral
triples, we shall simply consider (A, H, D; ρ) that has all the properties of a real twisted spectral
triple, with real structure J, except that D is not selfadjoint but ρ-hermitian.

Proposition 4.3. Let (A, H, D; ρ) be as explained above, with ρ implemented by a selfadjoint
unitary R such that JR = ǫ′′′ RJ. Then the bilinear form AρD is such that

                           AρD (ψ, φ) = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ AρD (φ, ψ)   ∀ψ, φ ∈ Dom D.                       (4.18)

Proof. By a similar calculation to that of Prop. 4.2, one arrives at

                                    AρD (ψ, φ) = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ hJφ, D † R† ψi.                          (4.19)

The ρ-hermicity of D together with R = R† implies D † R = RD. Hence

                           AρD (ψ, φ) = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ hJφ, RDψi = ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ AρD (φ, ψ).                      

   As an illustration, consider the twisted spectral triple of the Standard Model (2.16) with ∂/,
J and γE substituted with their Lorentzian version,

       µ
where γM are the Minkovskian Dirac matrices (3.17). One checks that

Since JF2 = I (see (2.18)), the first equation yields (JM ⊗ JF )2 = I, that is ǫ = 1. The second and
third equations, together with DF JF = JF DF (coming from the KO dimension 6 of the spectral
triple (2.7)) yield

        DM (JM ⊗ JF ) = ∂/M JM ⊗ JF + γM JM ⊗ DF JF = JM ∂/M ⊗ JF + JM γM ⊗ JF DF

so that ǫ′ = 1. Finally one has γ 0 JM = −JM γ 0 , meaning ǫ′′′ = −1. Therefore ǫǫ′ ǫ′′′ = −1,
hence AρD in Prop. 4.3 is antisymmetric as expected.
    The gauge invariance proved in Prop. 4.1 does not depend on the selfadjointness of D, and
thus is still valid for ρ-hermitean D. What must be checked, however, for Prop. 4.3 to make
sense is that a twisted perturbation of a ρ-hermitean operator is still ρ-hermitean, and that this
property is preserved under gauge transformation.

Proposition 4.4. Let (A, H, D; ρ) be as in proposition 4.3. Assume ρ is compatible with the
real structure in the sense of (3.12). Then a twisted fluctuation

                                            DAρ = D + Aρ + JAρ J −1                                   (4.24)

of D is ρ-hermitian as long as Aρ is ρ-hermitian, i.e.

                                                   Aρ = A+ = ρ(A†ρ ).                                 (4.25)

In addition, any gauge transform

                             ′
                            DA ρ
                                 := ρ(U )DAρ U †          with U := Ad(u) for u ∈ U (A)               (4.26)

of a ρ-hermitian operator DAρ is still ρ-hermitian.

Condition (4.25) is the twisted version of the usual requirement that the gauge potential A in a
fluctuation of the metric should be selfadjoint.
   To summarize, there are two candidates for the fermionic action:

                                                             14
                             M ψi , where D M is a ρ-hermitian twisted fluctuation of the
   • A Lorentzian one: hJψ, DA ρ  ρ        Aρ
     Minkowskian operator (4.21).

   • A Euclidean one: hJψ, DA E ψi with ψ ∈ H and D E is a selfadjoint twisted fluctuation

The Lorentzian action has been considered in [35,45]. The Euclidean action is similar to the one
of the Standard Model [3], except that ψ is in HR instead of He .

gauge transformation is to rewrite it as

                                                       Λ2

Indeed, given a twisted spectral triple (A, H, D; ρ) (that is D selfadjoint with compact resolvent),
then under the map
                                          D → ρ(U )DU † ,                                     (4.33)
                †                     †    †                                †
one gets that DΛ2D is mapped to U DΛDU2    which has the same trace as DΛ2D . This is this action
that has been computed in [25] for a selfadjoint twisted fluctuation DAρ of the Dirac operator of
the Standard Model.
    If one considers instead a ρ-hermitian Dirac operator (with compact resolvent),

                                          D = D + = ρ(D)† ,                                  (4.34)

then one can write (4.32) in a twisted form (that is, without reference to the Hilbert adjoint) as
                                                      
                                                ρ(D)D
                                         Tr f            .                                  (4.35)
                                                  Λ2
                                                                   µ
Taking for D the ρ-Hermitian Minkowskian Dirac operator −iγM         ∂µ (which has locally compact
resolvent, see [46, Prop. 4.2] and reference therein), it returns the Euclidean action: by cyclicity
of the trace, one can substitute ρ(D)D with 12 (ρ(D)D + Dρ(D)), which is nothing but the
Euclidean Laplacian (up to a sign):

Remark 4.5. One could be tempted to substitute the Hilbert adjoint D † with the Krein adjoint
D + in (4.32), but it is well known that this is problematic, for D + D is an hyperbolic operator,

                                                  15
whereas the heat kernel technique used for the asymptotic expansion of S B are well defined only
for elliptic operators.


5    Conclusions and Outlook
The twist of the spectral triple corresponding to the Standard Model makes the Lorentzian
signature naturally emerge as a twisted-inner product. The spectral action can be modified
accordingly in order to make sense either of a selfadjoint Dirac operator, or of a ρ-hermitian one.
The first choice permits one to maintain the usual definition for the twisted spectral triple, but
restricts the gauge group to those unitaries whose twisted adjoint action preserves selfadjointness
(see [27]). On the other hand, choosing a ρ-hermitian Dirac operator does not restrict the gauge
group (ρ-hermicity is preserved by twisted fluctuations), but requires one to modify the definition
of twisted spectral triples in order to accommodate an operator D that is twisted selfadjoint
rather than selfadjoint.
    The modifications of the spectral action that we propose here do not yield the bosonic action
in a Lorentzian signature, which is a well-known and difficult problem. Nevertheless, twists
shed a new light on the problem, if one considers that the question is not so much to obtain
directly from a spectral formula the Einstein-Hilbert action in the Lorentzian signature, than to
be able to implement Wick rotation in a coherent way. Traditionally in quantum field theory,
one begins in a given Lorentz signature, Wick rotates to perform some calculation, then Wick
rotates back to obtain physical predictions. So far in noncommutative geometry, one starts with
a bosonic action in Euclidean signature, expands with heat kernel techniques and then Wick
rotates. The results of this paper suggest to start with a Lorentzian signature, for which a twist
is adapted (for twisted fluctuations preserve Krein hermicity, whereas usual fluctuations do not).
The spectral action (4.32) then yields the Einstein-Hilbert action in Euclidean signature, and
physical predictions are obtained by Wick rotating back to the Lorentzian model one has started
with. The added value of the twist is thus to prescribe a geometry upon which to “Wick rotate
back” [40].

A     Appendix: twisted gauge fluctuation
Given a twisted spectral (A, H, D), ρ, we check that the twisted adjoint action (2.25) of the
unitaries of A yields the twisted gauge transformation (2.26). In agreement with (2.21) and
(2.24)), for u a unitary of A, we write

                  U := Ad(u) = uJuJ −1 ,     ρ(U ) = Ad(ρ(u)) = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J −1 .              (A.1)




                                                16
Assuming ρ is a ∗ -automorphism (which is the case of the flip in the Standard Model), one first
checks that

      ρ(U )DU ∗ = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J ∗ DJu∗ J ∗ u∗
                  = ǫ′ ρ(u)Jρ(u)Du∗ J ∗ u∗      using DJ = ǫ′ JD
                  = ǫ′ ρ(u)Jρ(u) (ρ(u∗ )D + [D, u∗ ]ρ ) J ∗ u∗
                  = ǫ′ ρ(u)JDJ ∗ u∗ + ǫ′ ρ(u)Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗ u∗
                  = ρ(u)Du∗ + ǫ′ JJ ∗ ρ(u)Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗ u∗
                  = ρ(u)Du∗ + ǫ′ Jρ(u)J ∗ ρ(u)J [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗ u∗ using [J ∗ ρ(u)J, ρ(u)] = 0
                                                                    h                    i
                  = ρ(u)Du∗ + ǫ′ Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗ uJJ ∗ u∗ using [D, u∗ ]ρ , J ∗ ρ(u)J = 0
                                                                                         ρ
                  = ρ(u)Du∗ + ǫ′ Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗
                  = ρ(u) (ρ(u∗ )D + [D, u∗ ]ρ ) + ǫ′ Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗
                  = D + ρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ + ǫ′ Jρ(u) [D, u∗ ]ρ J ∗ .                               (A.2)

Then, noticing that by the order zero and the twisted first order condition one has

                                          [A, Jρ(a)J ∗ ]ρ = 0                                   (A.3)

for any twisted 1-form A = ai [D, bi ]ρ , one has

               ρ(U )AU ∗ = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J ∗ AJu∗ J ∗ u∗
                            = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J ∗ Jρ(u∗ )J ∗ Au∗ using [A, Jρ(u∗ )J ∗ ]ρ = 0
                            = ρ(u)Au∗ .                                                         (A.4)

As well,

             ρ(U )JAJ ∗ U ∗ = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J ∗ JAJ ∗ Ju∗ J ∗ u∗
                             = ρ(u)Jρ(u)Au∗ J ∗ u∗ JJ ∗
                             = ρ(u)Jρ(u)AJ ∗ u∗ Ju∗ J ∗ using [J ∗ u∗ J, u∗ ] = 0
                             = ρ(u)Jρ(u)J ∗ ρ(u∗ )JAu∗ J ∗ using [A, J ∗ u∗ J]ρ = 0
                             = Jρ(u)J ∗ ρ(u)ρ(u∗ )JAu∗ J ∗ using [Jρ(u)J ∗ , ρ(u)] = 0
                             = Jρ(u)Au∗ J ∗ .                                                   (A.5)

Therefore, collecting (A.2), (A.4) and (A.5), one finds that a twisted covariant operator DA =
D + A + ǫ′ JAJ ∗ is mapped under a twisted gauge trasformation to
                                                                               
      ρ(U )DA U = D + ρ(u)Au + ρ(u) [D, u ]ρ + ǫ J ρ(u)Au + ρ(u) [D, u ]ρ J ∗
                 ∗               ∗            ∗      ′          ∗             ∗
                                                                                          (A.6)

which is nothing but D + Au + JAu J ∗ for Au the twisted gauge transform (2.26).
