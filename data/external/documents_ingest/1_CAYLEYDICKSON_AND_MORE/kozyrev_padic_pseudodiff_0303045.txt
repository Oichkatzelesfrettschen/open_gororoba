Introduction

In the present paper we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators, which
generate p–adic diffusions. The constructed operators, unlike the Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation [1], will not be diagonalizable by the Fourier
transform. These operators will be diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets, introduced in [2]. Therefore we will call these operators non translationally invariant
(i.e., non commutative with the operators of shift).
In the present paper we consider only the problem of existence of the mentioned
operators. To show that the introduced operators T generate diffusions, one has
to show that the corresponding evolutions e−tT exist, conserve the cone of positive
functions and the total number of particles. Formally these conditions are satisfied,
the rigorous proof will be considered elsewhere.
Ultrametric diffusions were considered in [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [7], [8], [9]
ultrametric diffusions were applied for description of the relaxation processes in
disordered systems, for instance, in spin glasses and proteins. In the present paper
we describe diffusions with more general generators, compared to the considered in
the mentioned above literature.
The field of p–adic numbers is the simplest example of an ultrametric space. p–
Adic mathematical physics, see [1]–[16], studies the models of mathematical physics
with the help of p–adic analysis.
The results of the present paper have the following physical applications.
In the works [7], [14] p–adic analysis was applied to describe the replica symmetry breaking, for discussion of the replica approach see [19]. It was shown that
the Parisi matrix describing the replica symmetry breaking (before the n → 0 limit)
is a discrete analogue of a p–adic pseudofifferential operator. In the present paper

1

we introduce a new family of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. The discrete analogues of the introduced operators will be the new examples of the replica matrices.
The application of these replica matrices to disordered models (for which the n → 0
limit for the introduced operators have to be developed) would be an interesting
problem.
Another possible application of the approach of the present paper is the application to random walk on hierarchical landscapes of energy, relaxation phenomena
in complex systems and basin to basin kinetics, see [22] – [25], [26].
The structure of the present paper is as follows.
In Section 2 we remind some results from p–adic analysis and describe the basis
of p–adic wavelets.
In Section 3 we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators and prove
that these operators are diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets.
In Section 4 we discuss in more details some particular examples of pseudodifferential operators and compute the asymptotics of population of unit disk for the
corresponding ultrametric diffusion.
In Section 5 we in more details discuss the possible physical applications of the
results of the present paper.

p–Adic analysis

Remind some notations used in p–adic analysis, see [1] for details.
An ultrametric space is a metric space with the metrics k · k satisfying the strong
triangle inequality
kxyk ≤ max(kxzk, kyzk),
∀z
The simplest example of ultrametric space is the field Qp of p–adic numbers.
The field Qp of p–adic numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers
Q with respect to p–adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way.
An arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = pγ m
with m and
n
γm
n not divisible by p. The p–adic norm of the rational number x = p n is equal to
|x|p = p−γ . The strong triangle inequality for p–adic numbers takes the form
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p , |y|p).
p–Adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with the (convergent in p–adic
norm) series of the form
x=

xi pi ,

xi = 0, . . . , p − 1

γ=γ0

The ring Zp of p–adic integers contains p–adic numbers of the form

and the group Qp /Zp we identify with the set containing fractions

The Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation is defined as follows [1]

D f (x) =
Γp (−α)
α

f (x) − f (y)
dy
Qp |x − y|1+α

(2)

where dy is the Haar measure on Qp and Γp (−α) is a constant. This operator is
diagonalizable by the p–adic Fourier transform F :
D α f (x) = F −1 ◦ |k|αp ◦ F f (x)
p–Adic wavelets were introduced in [2], where the following theorem was proven.
Theorem. The set of functions {ψγjn }:

is an orthonormal basis in L2 (Qp ) of eigenvectors of the operator D α :

The theorem above shows that the p–adic wavelets are the basis of eigenvectors
for the operator (2). The operator (2), see [1], was considered as the generator of
the ultrametric diffusion. In the present paper we introduce a more general class
of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. These operators can not be diagonalized by
the p–adic Fourier transform, but we will show, that the introduced operators are
still diagonalizable by the p–adic wavelet transform (i.e. the p–adic wavelets are
eigenvectors of the introduced operators).
p–Adic numbers are related to the Bruhat–Tits trees, see [27]. The Bruhat–Tits
tree is the infinite tree (with the infinite number of edges and vertices) where each
vertex is connected with exactly p + 1 over vertices. p–Adic projective line, which
3

contains the field of p–adic numbers plus one infinite point, is equivalent to the
space of classes of equivalence of semiinfinite paths in the Bruhat–Tits tree. Two
(semiinfinite) paths are equivalent if they coincide, starting from some vertex. For
instance, the set of semiinfinite paths going through the fixed vertex and through p
edges incident to the vertex is homeomorphic to a p–adic disk.
This construction is the analogue of the Poincare model of the Lobachevskii
plane, where the Bruhat–Tits tree is the analogue of the Lobachevskii plane, the
p–adic (projective) line is the analogue of the absolute, and the (unique) path in
the Bruhat–Tits tree connecting x and y in Qp is the analogue of the geodesic line
connecting the points at the absolute.
We introduce the level, or height of the vertex, in the following way. We put in
correspondence to every vertex in the Bruhat–Tits tree the p–adic disk, corresponding to the following set of semiinfinite paths in the tree which begin in the vertex.
This set contains all the paths going through the p of p + 1 edges incident to the
vertex (excluding one edge incident to the path going through the infinite point of
the absolute). We call the level of the vertex the logp of the radius of this disk.
For two points x, y in Qp there exists the unique path in the Bruhat–Tits tree
connecting these two points. This path contains the unique point A(x, y) with the
highest level.

Construction of the pseudodifferential operators

In [28], [29] examples of ultrametric diffusions on a discrete set were considered. In
[1], [3], [4]–[6], [8]–[9] examples of p–adic diffusions were investigated.
In the present section we introduce a family of p–adic pseudodifferential operators, which generate ultrametric diffusions on the field Qp of p–adic numbers. The
existence of corresponding diffusions (possibility to take the exponent of the generator) will not be discussed in the present paper. The introduced pseudodifferential
operators will be the generalizations of the Vladimirov operator.
Consider the operator
T f (x) =

Z

T (x, y)(f (x) − f (y))dy

(5)

Here we take x, y lying in the field Qp of p–adic numbers. We consider the operator
T as the operator in the space L2 (Qp ) of complex valued square integrable functions
of p–adic argument.
In the following we will introduce some conditions for the kernel T (x, y). Operator of the form (5) satisfying these conditions we call the generator of the ultrametric
diffusion. We show that under these conditions the operator (5) will be diagonal in
the basis of p–adic wavelets, introduced in [2]. This means that the assumption of
ultrametricity of the diffusion makes the problem of investigation of the diffusion
exactly solvable.

4

Definition 1.
We call the transition probability (and the corresponding diffusion with the generator given by (5)) ultrametric, if the transition probability T (x, y)
depends only on the highest point A(x, y) lying at the path between x and y in the
Bruhat–Tits tree.
Notice that the transition probability T (x, y) is symmetric with respect to x, y
and satisfies the following property:
Lemma 2.
The function T (x, y) is symmetric and positive with respect to y,
and, for fixed x, is locally constant with respect to y outside any vicinity of x.
Moreover, for fixed x, the following condition is satisfied:
T (x, y) = const ,

if

|x − y|p = const

(6)

Vice versa, when the condition (6) is satisfied, the function T (x, y) satisfies the
conditions of Definition 1.
It is easy to see that the Vladimirov operator and similar operators with translationally invariant kernels T (x, y) (which depend only on the diference x − y and
therefore, under the corresponding conditions of integrability of the kernel, can be
diagonalized by the Fourier transform), satisfy the conditions of lemma 2. In the
present paper we introduce the examples of the generators with non translationally
invariant kernels.
The following theorem gives the general form of the kernel for the operator (5).
Theorem 3.

The function of the form
T (x, y) =

X

T (γn) δ1,|pγ x−pγ y|p Ω(|pγ x − n|p )

(7)

γn

where T (γn) ≥ 0, γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Qp /Zp satisfies the conditions of lemma 2.
Moreover, an arbitrary function satisfying (6) can be represented in the form
(7).
Proof
Positivity of T (x, y) is obvious.
Let us prove the symmetricity of T (x, y). We have
T (x, y) − T (y, x) =

X

T (γn) δ1,|pγ x−pγ y|p (Ω(|pγ x − n|p ) − Ω(|pγ y − n|p ))

(8)

γn

Let us prove that this expression is equal identically to zero. Consider the case when
x is such that the following characteristic function is non–zero:
Ω(|pγ x − n|p ) = 1
This implies
|x − p−γ n|p ≤ pγ
If
δ1,|pγ x−pγ y|p 6= 0
5

(9)

then
|x − y|p = pγ

(10)

Formulas (9), (10) and ultrametricity imply that
Ω(|pγ y − n|p ) = 1
Therefore the corresponding terms in (8) cancel. This proves that T (x, y) given by
(7) is symmetric.
Prove that T (x, y) given by (7) satisfies (6). Fix x ∈ Qp . Then for y lying at the
sphere with the center in x and the radius pγ we have
δ1,|pγ x−pγ y|p = 1
and
Ω(|pγ x − n|p )
will be equal to 0 or 1 depending on whether p−γ n lies in the disk
{y : |x − y|p ≤ pγ }
or no. Therefore T (x, y) will be a constant on the considered sphere and (6) will be
satisfied.
This proves that T (x, y) satisfying the conditions of the present lemma will satisfy
lemma 2.
Vice versa, it is easy to see that the kernel (7) for x, y lying in the disk with the
center in p−γ n and the radius pγ , and satisfying |x − y|p = pγ , takes the value T (γn) .
Since all the space x, y ∈ Qp × Qp is the disjoint union of such a subsets, therefore, taking an arbitrary positive T (γn) we are able to construct an arbitrary kernel
satisfying (6). This finishes the proof of the theorem.
In the next theorem we compute the eigenvalues of the generator of ultrametric
diffusion.
Theorem 4.
Let the kernel (6) satisfy the condition of convergence of all the
integrals in (12) for any γ, n. Then the operator (5) is a well defined operator in
L2 (Qp ) with the dense domain and the p–adic wavelets ψγjn are eigenvectors for the
ultrametric diffusion:
T ψγjn = λγn ψγjn
(11)
with the eigenvalues
λγn =

Proof
Then

Z

|n−pγ y|p >1

T (p−γ n, y)dy + pγ T (p−γ n, p−γ (n + 1))

(12)

To prove the present theorem we use Lemma 2. Consider the wavelet ψγjn .
T ψγjn (x) =

Z

T (x, y) (ψγjn (x) − ψγjn (y)) dy
6

Consider the following cases.
1) Let |pγ x − n|p > 1. Then Lemma 2 implies
Z

T ψγjn (x) =

T (x, y)ψγjn (x)dy − T (x, n)

Z

ψγjn (y)dy = 0

!

T (x, y)(ψγjn (x)−ψγjn (y))dy =

2) Let |pγ x − n|p ≤ 1. Then again by Lemma 2
T ψγjn (x) =

T (x, x + p−γ l)(ψγjn (x) −ψγjn (x+ p−γ l))

l=1

The last equality follows from Lemma 2 and the local constance of ψγjn .
Using the identity
γ

ψγjn (x + p−γ l) = p− 2 χ(pγ−1 j(x + p−γ l))Ω(|pγ (x + p−γ l) − n|p ) = χ(p−1 jl)ψγjn (x)
and Lemma 2, we obtain


T ψγjn (x) = ψγjn (x) 

which gives (12).
Therefore the operator T is well defined on the basis in L2 (Qp ) that finishes the
proof of the theorem. Note that convergence of all the integrals used in the proof is
guaranteed by convergence of (12).
The next corollary gives a simple representation for the eigenvalues of the generator with the kernel (7).

Conclusion

In the present paper we construct the new family of p–adic pseudodifferential operators T and show that these operators are diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets.
This allows to compute analytically the corresponding evolutions e−tT .
The approach of the present paper may be applied to the problem of investigation of the diffusion on hierarchical energy landscapes. The concept of hierarchical
energy landscape attracts a lot of interest in connection with investigation of complex systems, in particular, glasses, clusters, and proteins [17]-[26]. Discuss this
concept using the language of basis to basis kinetics [26]. In the framework of this
concept a complex system is assumed to have a large number of metastable configurations, corresponding to local minima of energy. The local minima are clustered in
hierarchically nested basins of minima, namely, each large basin consists of smaller
basins, each of these consisting of even smaller ones, and so on. In the other words,
the hierarchy of basins possesses ultrametric geometry. Finally, the basins of minima are separated from one another by a hierarchically arranged set of barriers, i.e.,
high barriers separate large basins, and smaller basins within each larger one are
separated by lower barriers.
The concept of hierarchical energy landscape may be considered as a kind of
approximation of a complex energy landscape by a hierarchical energy landscape.
The dynamics of the system with hierarchical energy landscape it is natural to
describe by the models of ultrametric diffusion.
11

It is commonly recognized that relevant analytical tools should be developed for
applying the concept of hierarchical energy landscape to the description of relaxation
phenomena in complex systems [22] – [25], [26] (the concept of “basin–to–basin
kinetics”).
The present paper is devoted to the development of these analytical tools. We
show, that for some wide class of ultrametric diffusions the corresponding generators
(p–adic pseudodifferential operators) may be diagonalized in the basis of p–adic
wavlets, introduced in [2]. This means that the random walk on the corresponding
energy landscape may be investigated analytically.
