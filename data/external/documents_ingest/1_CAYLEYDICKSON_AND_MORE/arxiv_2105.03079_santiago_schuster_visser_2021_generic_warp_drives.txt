Abstract: Three recent articles have claimed that it is possible to, at least in theory,
either set up positive energy warp drives satisfying the weak energy condition (WEC), or
at the very least, to minimize the WEC violations. These claims are at best incomplete,
since the arguments as presented only assert but do not prove the existence of one
set of timelike observers, the co-moving Eulerian observers, who see relatively “nice”
physics. While these particular observers might arguably see a positive energy density,
the WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy density. Therefore, one
should carefully revisit this issue. A more careful analysis shows that the situation
is actually much grimmer than advertised — within the framework adopted by those
three papers all physically reasonable warp drives will certainly violate the WEC, and
both the strong and dominant energy conditions. Under plausible subsidiary conditions
the null energy condition is also violated. While warp drives are certainly interesting
examples of speculative physics, the violation of the energy conditions, at least within
the framework of standard general relativity, is unavoidable. Even in modified gravity,
physically reasonable warp drives will still violate the purely geometrical null convergence
condition and the timelike convergence condition which, in turn, will place very strong
constraints on any modified-gravity warp drive.

Introduction

Three recent articles [1–3] have argued for the existence of “physically reasonable”
positive-energy warp drive configurations, either satisfying the weak energy condition
(WEC), or minimizing violations thereof. (See also the series of articles [4–8].) These
claims are in sharp contrast to the 25-year-old consensus opinion that at least some
energy condition violations are necessary for the generation of warp fields [9–29].
Specifically, known results already include:
• Alcubierre warp drives have long been known to violate the WEC [9], and have
more recently been shown to also violate the null energy condition (NEC) [29].
• Natário zero-expansion warp drives have long been known to violate the WEC [10].
• Generic Natário warp drives are known to violate the dominant energy condition
(DEC) [15], and have also been shown to violate either the strong energy condition
(SEC) or the WEC [10].
We shall strengthen these well known results below, first showing that the Natário zeroexpansion warp drives also violate the SEC, and the NEC, and then ultimately showing
that generic Natário warp drives (including the variants discussed in references [1–3])
violate the WEC, and under plausible subsidiary conditions also violate the NEC.
How, then, is this result compatible with the various rather bold claims made in
references [1–3]? (And, for that matter, various parts of the popular press.) The key
observation is that WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy density,
whereas the analyses of references [1–3] at best only investigate the energy density as
seen by one class of timelike observers (the co-moving Eulerian observers). Thus the
claims made in references [1–3] are at best grossly incomplete, and in many key specific
details, wrong.
To set the stage, in section 2 we shall first discuss the kinematics of generic Natário warp
drive spacetimes, and then calculate the relevant spacetime curvature (Riemann, Ricci,
and Einstein tensors) in section 3. Assuming standard general relativity, we calculate
in section 4 all the components of the generic Natário warp-field stress-energy tensor.
In section 5, we then provide a number of general results regarding the implications of
the point-wise energy conditions, and relate them to the null and timelike convergence
conditions in section 6. With those preliminaries out of the way, the actual proof of energy
condition violations in generic Natário warp-field spacetimes will be straightforward
(section 7). We conclude with some comments on the possibility of either moving
beyond Einstein gravity, or the possibility of further generalizing the notion of warp-field
spacetimes. Nevertheless, within the context of standard Einstein gravity, we emphasize
that in physically reasonable warp field spacetimes energy condition violations are
utterly unavoidable, and must be squarely faced.
–2–

In the appendices, we discuss various technical issues arising in recent papers concerning
themselves with warp drives: Appendix A deals with a confusion over the precise meaning
of “spherical symmetry” in warp space-times. Appendix B points to misunderstandings
regarding coordinate transformations. Appendix C addresses issues of differentiability
and related technical issues. Finally, Appendix D lists further technical oversights, small
and large, of recent publications.

Warp drive kinematics

The generic Natário warp drive line element we shall consider is this [10]:


ds2 = −dt2 + δij dxi − v i (x, y, z, t) dt dxj − v j (x, y, z, t) dt .

(2.1)

Natário calls this a “warp drive spacetime”. Both the vector v i (x, y, z, t) and its
derivatives are assumed to be smooth and bounded [10]. This line element is sufficiently
general to cover well over 99% of the relevant literature, and the very few exceptions in
the extant literature will be explicitly discussed later on in appendix B. Certainly the
models discussed in references [1–3] fall into this generic Natário framework.
The line element represents an ADM-like (3+1) decomposition of the metric [30–36],
with unit lapse N → 1; a flow vector v i = −(shift vector); and a flat spatial 3-metric
gij = δij . The sign-flip on the shift vector is traditional in a warp drive context, and
inspired by the notion of “flow” rather than “shift”. Accordingly we shall speak of
the “flow vector” rather than the “shift vector”. (See also the traditional usage in the
“analogue spacetime” programme [37–41].) The explicit metric components are

−v δ − v i v j
The metric signature is manifestly − + ++, while spacetime indices such as a, b, ... run
from 0 to 3, and spatial indices such as i, j... run from 1 to 3. At large spatial distances
we want the spacetime to be asymptotically flat, (that is, asymptotically Minkowski or
at worst asymptotically Schwarzschild).
The most natural boundary conditions to impose are that v i (x, y, z, t) → 0 at spatial
infinity. One could alternatively impose v i (x, y, z, t) → v∗i (t) at spatial infinity, with
v∗i (t) some function of time only. This would still be asymptotically Minkowski, but with
R
new spatial coordinates xi → x̄i = xi − v∗i (t) dt. This would be useful, for instance, if
one wishes to adopt a coordinate system moving with the warp bubble. But there is
certainly no loss of generality in enforcing v i (x, y, z, t) → 0 at spatial infinity.
–3–

Indeed there is a very important issue of physics hiding here — physically we want the
warp bubble (for at least part of the time) to be “moving” with respect to the “fixed
stars” — otherwise the construction is physically uninteresting. Motion between the
warp bubble and the fixed stars can be achieved thusly: Either by choosing coordinates
such that v i (x, y, z, t) → 0 at spatial infinity (so the fixed stars are “at rest”) while the
warp bubble has explicit time dependence, or alternatively, by choosing coordinates
where the warp bubble (the central region of the spacetime) is time independent and
the fixed stars are in motion v i (x, y, z, t) → v∗i (t) at spatial infinity.
Furthermore, we want the warp bubble to be physically well-localized; we do not wish
to have to accelerate the entire universe to get an interesting warp field. On the other
hand, demanding that the flow vector have compact support (while mathematically
convenient) is physically unnecessarily restrictive. For our purposes it will be more than
sufficient for us to demand that the flow field falls off sufficiently rapidly near spatial
infinity so that we can integrate by parts. The key point in proving NEC violations
(and so implicitly proving violations of WEC, SEC, and DEC) is the significantly weaker
condition that gradients of the flow field tend to zero at spatial infinity. We shall expand
on this point more extensively in the discussion below.
Following Natário, we shall also demand that the flow field (and hence the metric) be
sufficiently smooth and bounded. At the very worst we shall allow Israel–Lanczos–Sen
“thin-shell” distributional contributions to the Riemann tensor. Such assumptions are
completely standard and implicit in the extant literature.
Specifically, we shall demand that the flow ~v (and hence the metric) be C 2− at worst,
that is, piecewise twice differentiable, with at worst discontinuous first derivatives. Then
the Christoffel symbols are C 1− at worst, that is, piecewise once differentiable with at
worst step-function discontinuities. Then the Riemann tensor is C 0 at worst, piecewise
continuous with at worst delta-function contributions.
Finally, we emphasize the need for at least some subsidiary conditions to be applied to
the generic Natário metric (2.1) in order to distinguish a warp drive from, for instance,
the Painlevé–Gullstrand version of Schwarzschild spacetime. The line element (2.1) is
sufficiently general and explicit to be physically interesting as a warp drive exemplar,
but some subsidiary conditions would still be desirable.

–4–

Because the spatial 3-slices are intrinsically flat, and the lapse is unity, the only nontrivial
physics hides in the extrinsic curvature of the spatial 3-slices, for which we have the
particularly simple result
Kij = v(i,j) .
(2.3)
In order to prevent the warp field being trivial (Minkowski space) we will demand that
there is at least one point in spacetime where the extrinsic curvature is nonzero.
Let us define na = −∇a t = (−1; 0, 0, 0)a . Then we have na = g ab nb = −g at = (1, v i ).
Thus na is future-pointing. It is actually a future-pointing 4-velocity normal to the
spatial 3-slices: g ab na nb = −1 = gab na nb . Observers with 4-velocity na are often called
“Eulerian”. In some sense (see discussion below) they “go with the flow”, they are
“co-moving”. Furthermore, the Eulerian observers na = −g ab ∇b t are in fact timelike
geodesics. This is a simple consequence of the fact that the warp spacetimes are
unit-lapse:
1
1
nb ∇b na = g ac nb ∇b ∇c t = g ac nb ∇c ∇b t = g ac nb ∇c nb = g ac ∇c (nb nb ) = g ac ∇c (−1) = 0.
2
2
(2.4)
The warp drive spacetime is by construction globally hyperbolic, and at each and every
instant in time “t” the Eulerian observers are 4-orthogonal to the flat spatial slices —
so the Eulerian observers define a zero-vorticity congruence of timelike geodesics that
by construction cannot have any focussing points.1
From the metric line element one can easily read off a suitable choice of co-tetrad: The
timelike covector is simply
(e0̂ )a = (1; 0, 0, 0)a = na ,

(2.5)

(e2̂ )a = (−vy ; 0, 1, 0)a ,

(2.6)

while the spatial co-triad is
(e1̂ )a = (−vx ; 1, 0, 0)a ,

1

(e3̂ )a = (−vz ; 0, 0, 1)a .

Everett [11] takes the point of view that one might take this warp drive metric as a local notion
only, thus avoiding the global hyperbolicity conditions of the original Alcubierre space-time, and uses
that to construct closed timelike curves (CTCs). This introduces a whole new level of complexity
related to global causality and “chronology protection”, of which more anon.

–5–

The corresponding tetrad is then easily determined: The timelike leg is
(e0̂ )a = (1; v x , v y , v z )a = na ,

(2.7)

while now the spatial triad is particularly simple
(e1̂ )a = (0; 1, 0, 0)a ,

(e2̂ )a = (0; 0, 1, 0)a ,

(e3̂ )a = (0; 0, 0, 1)a .

This implies that, in the co-moving orthonormal basis, for any T20 tensor:
# "

=
.
=
Xâb̂ = eâ a eb̂ b Xab =
Xî0̂ Xîĵ
Xin Xij
Xia na Xij

(2.8)

(2.9)

This is why objects such as Xnn = Xab na nb = X0̂0̂ and Xni = Xai na = X0̂î are so
important. Subject to this choice of coordinates and tetrad, for the covariant spatial
components we have the particularly simple result Xîĵ = Xij . We will often use this
observation to simplify formulae by suppressing the “hats” when they are not critical
to understanding.
Similarly, for any fully covariant T40 tensor one has Xâb̂ĉdˆ = eâ a eb̂ b eĉ c edˆd Xabdc . Then for
any tensor that has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor it suffices to calculate
X0̂î0̂ĵ = Xninj = na nb Xaibj ;

X0̂îĵ k̂ = Xnijk = na Xaijk ;

Xîĵ k̂l̂ = Xijkl .

(2.10)

Some specific examples of the generic warp drive spacetime are:
Alcubierre warp field [9]:
The original Alcubierre warp field [9], taken to be moving in the z direction with
constant velocity v∗ , is given by

p
(2.11)
v i (x, y, z, t) = (0, 0, 1)i v∗ f
x2 + y 2 + (z − v∗ t)2 .
Here, f (0) = 1, and f (∞) = 0.
This was rapidly generalized [9] to a time-dependent velocity for the warp bubble
s


2
Z
v i (x, y, z, t) = (0, 0, 1)i v∗ (t) f  x2 + y 2 + z − v∗ (t) dt  .
(2.12)
Note these specific models are “spherically symmetric”. More on this point below.
Despite repeated assertions in reference [2] there is absolutely no difficulty in
making the velocity of the warp bubble time-dependent.
–6–

Natário zero-expansion warp field [10]:
The Natário zero-expansion warp drive simply sets ∇ · ~v = 0. Note that the
second half of Natário’s 2001 paper [10] focusses on this zero-expansion warp
field, whereas the first half of that paper deals with the generic Natário warp field
spacetime of equation (2.1). When mentioning Natário’s warp field, it is therefore
important to make explicit which of these two specific warp drives one is referring
to.
Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg zero-vorticity warp field [1, 3]:
The Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg zero-vorticity warp drive uses a purely gradient flow
~v = ∇Φ, implying ~ω = ∇ × ~v = 0.
Thus the generic warp drive line element (2.1), introduced by Natário in [10], covers all
three of these specific cases, and many more, and is sufficiently general to cover almost
all of the relevant literature.

Warp-field curvature

The spacetime curvature for warp drive spacetimes is relatively easily determined via a
specific application of the ADM formalism [30–36].
3.1

Riemann tensor

The Gauss–Codazzi equations would in general imply2 :
Rîĵ k̂l̂ = (3)Rîĵ k̂l̂ + Kîk̂ Kĵ l̂ − Kîl̂ Kĵ k̂ .

(3.1)

However, since our 3-geometry is flat, we have (3)Rîĵ k̂l̂ → 0, and because of our choice of
spatial triad we can dispense with the “hats”. So for warp drive spacetimes we simply
have
Rijkl = Kik Kjl − Kil Kjk .
(3.2)
The Gauss–Mainardi equations imply3 :
Rnijk = Raijk na = Kij,k − Kik,j = v(i,j),k − v(i,k),j = v[j,k],i .

2
3

See for instance equation (2.92) of Gourgoulhon [31].
See for instance equation (2.101) of Gourgoulhon [31], specializing to Kij = v(i,j) .

–7–

(3.3)

The remaining components of the Riemann tensor do not (to our knowledge) seem to
have a special name, and are a little trickier to calculate. In the present context, to
explicitly calculate Rninj one could either use brute force (e.g., Maple), or appeal to a
simplification of the ADM formalism,4 or use the general commutator identity
[∇a , ∇b ]nc = −Rd cab nd ,

(3.4)

suitably projected onto spatial and normal n directions.
One finds
Rninj = Raibj na nb = −Ln Kij + (K 2 )ij .

(3.5)

Here Ln Kij is the Lie derivative of the extrinsic curvature, where K̇ij = ∂t Kij , and
Ln Kij = K̇ij + v k ∂k Kij + ∂i v k Kkj + ∂j v k Kik .

(3.6)

(K 2 )ij = Kik δ kl Klj .

(3.7)

Also
We can rewrite the Lie derivative as
Ln Kij = K̇ij + v k ∂k Kij + ∂[i vk] Kkj + Kik ∂[j vk] + 2(K 2 )ij ,

(3.8)

Ln Kij = na ∂a Kij + ∂[i vk] Kkj + Kik ∂[j vk] + 2(K 2 )ij .

(3.9)

Rninj = −na ∂a Kij − ∂[i vk] Kkj − Kik ∂[j vk] − (K 2 )ij .

(3.10)

implying
Therefore

3.2

Ricci tensor

Performing suitable contractions, for the Ricci tensor we find

Rnn = −Ln K − tr K 2 ,

(3.11)

where Ln K is the Lie derivative of K = Kij δ ij = tr(K), the trace of the extrinsic
curvature. That is, Ln K = K̇ + v i ∂i K = na ∂a K, so we also have

Rnn = −na ∂a K − tr K 2 .
4

For instance, use equation (3.43) of Gourgoulhon [31], specializing to N → 1,
and flipping the sign of the Lie derivative term to account for (flow) = −(shift).

–8–

(3.12)

Furthermore,
Rni = Kij,k δ jk − K,i .

(3.13)

In view of the fact that in this context spatial indices are always raised and lowered
using Kronecker deltas, we can and shall often simplify notation by contracting over
two indices down and writing
Rni = Kij,j − K,i .
(3.14)
Finally, for the spatial components
Rij = Ln Kij + KKij − 2(K 2 )ij ,

(3.15)

Rij = na ∂a Kij + KKij + ∂[i vk] Kkj + Kik ∂[j vk] .

(3.16)

Rij = ∂a (na Kij ) + ∂[i vk] Kkj + Kik ∂[j vk] .

(3.17)

which can be recast as

Alternatively
Then for the Ricci scalar R = −Rnn + δ ij Rij we have

R = 2Ln K + K 2 + tr K 2 .

(3.18)

Here, in full, tr(K 2 ) = (K 2 )ij δ ij = Kij δ ik δ jl Kkl , though we can and shall often
simplify notation by writing tr(K 2 ) = Kij Kij , implying contraction on the repeated
down indices.

Warp-field stress-energy tensor

In this section, we use the standard Einstein equations Gab = 8πTab and analyse the
density, flux, and spatial components of the stress-energy.
4.1

Density

In the Eulerian orthonormal basis, using (3.19), for the density we have:
ρ=

Gnn

K 2 − tr K 2 .

(4.1)

(Everyone agrees with this. This is the quantity that Lentz [1] and Fell–Heisenberg [3]
eventually try to force to be positive. This is the only quantity Bobrick–Martire [2]
explicitly calculate.) Now it is a mathematical identity that for any 3 × 3 matrix

K 2 − tr K 2 = 2 tr (cof(Kij )) .

(4.2)

That is, K 2 − tr(K 2 ) is twice the trace of the cofactor matrix of the 3 × 3 matrix Kij .
This is most easily established by diagonalizing the 3 × 3 matrix. So in (3+1) dimensions
the Eulerian energy density is intimately related to the cofactor matrix of the extrinsic
curvature. This is the “hidden geometric structure” alluded to by Fell–Heisenberg in
reference [3], a curiosity which is unfortunately less useful than one might hope.
In the present context we have the fully explicit result
ρ=



(vi,i )2 − v(i,j) v(i,j) .
16π

(4.3)

It is straightforward to rewrite this as a spatial divergence plus a negative semi-definite
contribution:

∂i (vi vj,j − vj vi,j ) − v[i,j] v[i,j] .

That is, for the generic warp field, the Eulerian energy density is always the sum of a
3-divergence plus a quantity that is negative semi-definite. We will have occasion to
repeatedly use this result in subsequent discussion.
4.2

For the flux, in the Eulerian orthonormal basis, using (3.20) we have:

Overall, we see that the generic Natário line element (2.1) is sufficiently simple to permit
detailed and explicit calculations, while being sufficiently general to encompass almost
all physically interesting warp drive spacetimes.

Energy conditions

The (classical point-wise) energy conditions are constraints one places on the stressenergy as a way of keeping unusual physics somewhat under control. The energy
conditions all correspond, in some sense, to demanding that for some class of observers
the energy density be non-negative.

– 12 –

Standard definitions are [31–33, 42–48]:
NEC: For all null vectors k a we demand Tab k a k b ≥ 0.
WEC: For all timelike vectors V a we demand Tab V a V b ≥ 0.
SEC: For all timelike vectors V a we demand (Tab − 12 T gab )V a V b ≥ 0.
DEC: For all future-pointing timelike vectors V a and W a we demand Tab V a W b ≥ 0.
(The DEC in particular has a number of equivalent formulations [45].)
The standard linkages between energy conditions are [31–33, 42–48]:
DEC =⇒ WEC =⇒ NEC

(5.1)

SEC =⇒ NEC

(5.2)

WEC 6⇐⇒ SEC

(5.3)

But
Despite claims made in early versions of [3], the WEC is not the weakest of the energy
conditions.
Some examples of the subtleties involved are:
• A positive cosmological constant (positive vacuum energy density) satisfies the
NEC and WEC, but not the SEC.
• A negative cosmological constant (negative vacuum energy density) satisfies the
NEC and SEC, but not the WEC.
• Massive scalar fields, (classical, minimally coupled, with positive kinetic energy,
and positive mass squared so that they are not tachyonic), satisfy the NEC and
WEC but can violate the SEC. For example the standard scalar inflaton field of
cosmological inflation satisfies the NEC and WEC but violates the SEC.
• Classical Maxwell electromagnetism satisfies all the usual energy conditions.
These examples suggest some caution when interpreting the physical significance of the
energy conditions [49–58].
There are indications that NEC and WEC can be violated on microscopic (quantum)
scales [59–77], though they seem to be satisfied by (reasonable) matter on macroscopic
scales. In contrast the SEC appears to be observationally violated on the largest
cosmological scales [51–57].

– 13 –

While for the purposes of this paper we will be focussing on applying these pointwise energy conditions specifically to warp drive spacetimes, it should be noted that
these energy conditions also have direct applications to singularity theorems, positivemass theorems, traversable wormholes [78–87], topological censorship, and chronology
protection [89–93].
Other less commonly used energy conditions are:
• TEC — trace energy condition: ρ − 3p ≥ 0. Mainly of historic interest [49, 50].
Believed to be violated deep in the cores of neutron stars. Definitely violated by
(hypothetical) “stiff matter” ρ = p, where (speed of sound) = (speed of light).
• FEC — flux energy condition: for all timelike observers, V a , the flux F a = T ab Vb
is either timelike or null [59, 60].
(FEC is a weakening of DEC; that is, DEC =⇒ FEC.)
• Averaged energy conditions (typically averaged along timelike or null geodesics)
are weaker than their corresponding point-wise counterparts. The most useful
of the averaged energy conditions is typically the ANEC (averaged null energy
condition) where one averages the NEC along timelike geodesics using an affine
parameterization [43, 71–77].
As a cautionary example regarding application of the energy conditions, note that all
three of the recent Lentz [1], Bobrick–Martire [2], and Fell–Heisenberg [3] articles merely
assert the existence of one sub-class of timelike observers for which the energy density
is positive. This is not enough to show that the WEC is satisfied. To explicitly see a
specific example of this behaviour, let us work in an orthonormal basis. Take ρ0 > 0
and Γ > 1, and consider:


1 0
0
0


0 
 0 −Γ2 0
Tâb̂ = ρ0 
(5.4)

 0 0 −Γ2 0 
0 0
0 −Γ2 âb̂
Then in the natural rest frame V â = (1; 0, 0, 0)â we have ρ = Tâb̂ V â V b̂ = ρ0 > 0. But a
moving observer, with 4-velocity V â = γ(1; v ni )â , where ni is any unit spatial 3-vector,
will see an energy density
ρ = Tâb̂ V â V b̂ = ρ0 γ 2 (1 − Γ2 v 2 ).

(5.5)

For a sufficiently rapidly moving but still subluminal observer, with |v| > 1/Γ, the
energy density will be seen to be negative. So in this example the WEC is violated.
– 14 –

What Lentz [1], and Bobrick–Martire [2], and Fell–Heisenberg [3] should be doing is to
also calculate all of the stress components Tij . It is not enough for them to just focus
on Tnn and Tni .
One way of proceeding is to assume the stress-energy tensor is of Hawking–Ellis type I,
see references [42–44, 60, 96–100], and work with the Lorentz-invariant eigenvalues
{ρ, pi }, the Lorentz-invariant eigen-energy-density and principal pressures, respectively.
Then it is a standard result that in terms of the Lorentz-invariant eigenvalues of a type I
stress-energy tensor one has the two-way implications [42–44, 60, 96–100]
NEC ⇐⇒ ρ + pi ≥ 0.

(5.6)

WEC ⇐⇒ ρ + pi ≥ 0 & ρ > 0.
P
SEC ⇐⇒ ρ + pi ≥ 0 & ρ + i pi > 0.

(5.7)

DEC ⇐⇒ |pi | ≤ ρ.

(5.9)

(5.8)

Unfortunately, we do not know a priori whether or not the stress-energy for the
warp drive is Hawking–Ellis type I in general, nor do the Eulerian observers typically
diagonalize the stress-energy. So one has to be a little more indirect. (A limited result
is this: For the zero-vorticity warp drives, because the Eulerian observers see zero flux
f~ = 0, the stress-energy is block diagonal, and so of Hawking–Ellis type I. In particular,
an even more limited and precise result is this: For a zero-vorticity warp drive, since
the stress-energy is Hawking–Ellis type I we explicitly have

Thus, by considering all possible physical values of the βi (including relativistic values),
we see that non-negative Eulerian density plus the NEC implies the WEC — so for
checking the WEC in this situation, checking ρ ≥ 0 is manifestly insufficient, one
additionally needs to check the NEC (ρ + pi ≥ 0) as well.)
In counterpoint, what the Eulerian observers do generically implement is a natural
orthonormal frame in which

NEC: Let us first investigate what we can say about the NEC. Let us take any two
oppositely oriented null vectors `â+ = (1, +`i )â , and `â− = (1, −`i )â , where `i is any
– 15 –

arbitrary unit spatial 3-vector. Then the NEC would imply both
Tâb̂ `â+ `b̂± = Tâb̂ (1, +`i )â (1, +`j )b̂ = ρ + 2fi `i + Tij `i `j ≥ 0,

(5.12)

Tâb̂ `â− `b̂− = Tâb̂ (1, −`i )â (1, −`j )b̂ = ρ − 2fi `i + Tij `i `j ≥ 0.

(5.13)

and

Averaging over these two equations, for any unit spatial 3-vector
NEC =⇒ ρ + Tij `i `j ≥ 0.

(5.14)

Note the implication is one-way; effectively one throws away all information contained
in the flux f i . In terms of the eigenvalues of the 3-stress we have5
NEC =⇒ ρ + min{λ(Tij )} ≥ 0.

(5.15)

Now pick a triad `iA of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors. Then for each member
of the triad the NEC implies
ρ + Tij `iA `jA ≥ 0.
(5.16)
Now average over the three members of the triad
ρ + Tij
Thence, noting that by construction

(5.18)

Defining, as usual, the average pressure as p̄ = 13 Tij δ ij , (this works even if the 3-stress
Tij is not diagonal), we see that
NEC =⇒ ρ + p̄ ≥ 0.

(5.19)

As long as the 3-stress is even slightly anisotropic we have min{λ(Tij )} 6= max{λ(Tij )}
so that we deduce the strict chain of inequalities
min{λ(Tij )} < p̄ < max{λ(Tij )}
5

(5.20)

For zero-vorticity warp drives one has the stronger equivalence that NEC ⇐⇒ ρ + min{λ(Tij )} ≥ 0.

– 16 –

Thence in the presence of anisotropies we can make the slightly stronger strict inequality
involving the average pressure p̄ that
NEC =⇒ ρ + p̄ > 0.

(5.21)

The implication is again one-way. Note also that this argument has nothing specific
to do with warp drives, it is purely a statement about how the NEC implies an easily
checked inequality that depends only on the existence of some orthonormal basis. For
our current purposes the point is that it is relatively easy to pick a specific direction
and calculate Tij `i `j , or to average over all directions and calculate p̄.
WEC: Similar things can be said about the WEC, although now one takes some
0 ≤ β < 1 and considers two oppositely oriented timelike vectors V±a = γ(1, ±β`i )a .
Then for any unit 3-vector `i , after averaging over the two orientations:
WEC =⇒ ρ + β 2 Tij `i `j ≥ 0.

(5.22)

Then averaging over a triad of unit vectors, for all 0 ≤ β < 1 one has
WEC =⇒ ρ + β 2 p̄ ≥ 0.

(5.23)

By considering β = 0 and the limit β → 1 one has
WEC =⇒ ρ ≥ 0 & ρ + p̄ ≥ 0.

(5.24)

The implication is again one-way. And the point is that Tij `i `j and p̄ are relatively
easy to calculate. As long as the 3-stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the
slightly stronger statement involving the average pressure p̄ that
WEC =⇒ ρ ≥ 0 & ρ + p̄ > 0.

(5.25)

SEC: The SEC can be phrased in terms of the so-called “trace-reversed” stress-energy
tensor Tab − 12 T gab , as the condition (Tab − 12 T gab )V a V b ≥ 0, which in turn is equivalent
to enforcing Tab V a V b ≥ 12 (ρ − 3p̄). Then the SEC implies
ρ + β 2 Tij `i `j ≥ (1 − β 2 )

– 17 –

1
(ρ − 3p̄).
2

(5.26)

This can be rearranged to
SEC =⇒ (1 + β 2 )ρ + 3(1 − β 2 )p̄ + 2β 2 Tij `i `j ≥ 0.

(5.27)

Averaging over the unit directions `i , for all 0 ≤ β < 1 one has
SEC =⇒ (1 + β 2 )ρ + (3 − β 2 )p̄ ≥ 0.

(5.28)

By considering β = 0 and the limit β → 1 one has
SEC =⇒ ρ + 3p̄ ≥ 0 & ρ + p̄ ≥ 0.

(5.29)

The implication is again one-way. And the point is that Tij `i `j and p̄ are relatively
easy to calculate. As long as the 3-stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the
slightly stronger statement involving the average pressure p̄ that
SEC =⇒ ρ + 3p̄ > 0 & ρ + p̄ > 0.

(5.30)

DEC: One version of the DEC, as reported by Hawking and Ellis [42, page 91],
is formulated as the requirement that in any orthonormal frame the energy density
dominates all the other components of the stress-energy tensor:
|T âb̂ | ≤ T t̂t̂ .

|fi | ≤ ρ & |Tij | ≤ ρ.

The implication is one-way, but the inequality is particularly clean and easy to work
with. As long as the 3-stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the slightly

(5.35)

Timelike and null convergence conditions

In applications the various energy conditions are, using the Einstein equations, typically
immediately converted into purely geometrical convergence conditions such as the null
convergence condition (NCC) and the timelike convergence condition (TCC) [42–45].
Within standard general relativity the NCC is equivalent to the NEC, and the TCC is
equivalent to the SEC.
NCC: The NCC is the statement that for all null vectors Rab `a `b ≥ 0.
TCC: The TCC is the statement that for all timelike vectors Rab V a V b ≥ 0.
If one wishes to step outside the framework of standard general relativity then this
adds a new level of speculative physics to the mix, and then the distinction between
geometrical convergence conditions and dynamical energy conditions might become
important. However it should be emphasized that in many (but not all) modified
theories of gravity the equations of motion can be rearranged into the form
(Einstein tensor) = (some “effective” stress-energy tensor).

(6.1)

Whenever this can be done, statements about the usual energy conditions in Einstein
gravity can be carried over to statements about “effective” energy conditions in modified
gravity.

7

Violation of the energy conditions

Now consider the energy conditions in the warp drive spacetimes. We shall provide a
number of results, ultimately demonstrating the generic violation of the NEC (thereby
automatically implying violations of the WEC, SEC and DEC)
7.1

Alcubierre warp drive

The key defining characteristic of the Alcubierre warp drive is that vi (x, y, z, t) is always
pointing in some fixed direction, which can without loss of generality be taken to be

– 19 –

the z-direction ẑi = (0, 0, 1)i . That is, take
vi (x, y, z, t) = v(x, y, z, t) ẑi .

(7.1)

(This is slightly more general than what Alcubierre actually did [9]; but it is the best
way of summarizing the key aspects of the physics.) Then the extrinsic curvature is
simply

But to have a non-trivial warp bubble, we must avoid the situation where one has an
everywhere flat Minkowski space. So we need ((∂x v)2 + (∂y v)2 ) > 0 somewhere in the
spacetime, and so ρ < 0 at those particular locations, and is at best zero everywhere
else. Therefore the Alcubierre warp bubble definitely violates the WEC.
ρ=

In his original article [9] Alcubierre also claims (without proof): “In a similar way one
can show that the strong energy condition is also violated.” However in a more recent
article by Alcubierre and Lobo [29], they explicitly prove the stronger result that the
Alcubierre warp drive violates the NEC. (So SEC, WEC, and DEC are all definitely
violated, because NEC is.)
Their proof is slightly tricky and depends (for a warp bubble moving in the z direction)
on the identity Gzz = 3Gnn < 0. This identity is established by explicit computation,
there does not seem to be an obvious geometrical reason for it. From this geometrical
identity we have Tzz = 3ρ < 0 in the comoving frame. Hence ρ + Tzz = 4ρ < 0 and the
NEC is violated in all Alcubierre warp drives.

– 20 –

7.2

Natário zero-expansion warp drive

The key defining characteristic of the Natário zero-expansion warp drive is that the
flow vi (x, y, z, t) is zero divergence: ∇ · ~v = 0. (This is slightly more general than what
Natário actually did [10]; but it is the best way of summarizing the relevant physics.)
Then K = 0 and from (4.1) we have:
ρ=

(7.7)

But to avoid a trivial warp drive the extrinsic curvature Kij must be nonzero somewhere,
and wherever Kij 6= 0 we have ρ < 0. So the Natário zero-expansion warp drive definitely
violates the WEC [10].
But, now extending Natário’s argument from the second half of reference [10], we note
that in this situation, from equation (4.12), we also have
ρ + 3p̄ = −


1
tr K 2 ≤ 0.

(7.8)

And the same non-triviality argument as immediately above now shows that any Natário
zero-expansion warp drive also violates the SEC.
Furthermore, again extending Natário’s argument from the second half of reference [10],
now using equation (4.13) we note
ρ + p̄ = −



tr K 2 ≤ 0.

(7.9)

And the same non-triviality argument again shows that any Natário zero-expansion
warp drive also violates the NEC.
7.3

Zero-vorticity warp drive

The key defining characteristic of the Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg zero-vorticity warp drive
is that the flow vi (x, y, z, t) is taken to be a gradient vi (x, y, z, t) = ∂i Φ(x, y, z, t) [1, 3].
(This is slightly more general than what Lentz and Fell–Heisenberg actually did; but it
is the best way of summarizing the relevant physics.)
Then
Kij = Φ,ij ,

K = ∇2 Φ.

This no longer obviously violates the WEC, at least not as seen by Eulerian observers.
In view of equation (4.5), the energy density is now a pure 3-divergence
ρ=

1
{∂i (Φ,i Φ,jj − Φ,j Φ,ij )} .
16π

(7.12)

In this class of zero-vorticity warp drives the comoving flux is identically zero, f i = 0.
Unfortunately, the spatial parts of the stress-energy Tij are still a bit of a mess, they do
not really simplify appreciably. (And one really needs to know something about the
spatial stresses Tij in order to say anything more precise about the energy conditions.)
Fortunately, the average pressure is reasonably tractable. From equation (4.13),
ρ + p̄ =

24π
(7.13)

Now, given that we want our warp field to be localizable, to not spread over and
affect the whole spacetime, it is natural to make the assumption that the flow field
vi (x, y, z, t) = ∂i Φ(x, y, z, t) obeys some sort of fall-off conditions at spatial infinity.
It is certainly more than sufficient if Ji = (Φ,i Φ,jj − Φ,j Φ,ij ) = o(r−2 ) for large distances,
which is in turn certainly true if Φi = o(r−1/2 ), which is in turn certainly true if the ADM
mass is zero. Vanishing of the ADM mass is certainly the case for Alcubierre’s warp drive,
and also for Natario’s zero-expansion warp drive, and is a first crude approximation for
well-localized warp fields. (We will subsequently significantly weaken this condition.) If
this is the case, then it follows immediately that
Z

ρ d3 x = 0.

(7.14)

R3

But then, if the warp field has positive energy density anywhere, it must have negative
energy density somewhere else. This implies violations of the WEC somewhere on each
spatial slice. We shall subsequently be more specific by invoking stronger arguments
using much weaker falloff conditions.
Unfortunately, as we have previously argued, non-negativity of the Eulerian energy
density, ρ ≥ 0, is insufficient to establish the WEC for a zero-vorticity warp drive; one

– 22 –

needs to check the NEC as well. The spatial parts of the stress-energy Tij are still a
bit of a mess, they do not really simplify appreciably. (And one really needs to know
something about the spatial stresses Tij in order to say anything more precise about
the energy conditions.) Fortunately, the average pressure is reasonably tractable. From

The best way of proceeding seems to be to adapt, modify, and extend a general argument
that Natário applied to his general class of warp drive spacetimes [10]. Let us do this
now.

Natário’s generic warp drive

WEC: We have already established that from equation (4.6) it follows in general that

∇ · {~v K − (~v · ∇)~v } − (~ω · ~ω ) .

is well-localized, and that gradients of vi → 0 sufficiently rapidly at spatial infinity, an
integration by parts implies
Z
Z

3
ρd x=−

Again, if the warp field has positive energy density anywhere, it must have negative
energy density somewhere else. This already implies violations of the WEC somewhere
on each spatial slice. (We shall establish stronger results using weaker hypotheses
below.)
WEC-or-SEC: To improve on the preceding result for the WEC, and side-step the
need for strong asymptotic falloff conditions, note that in reference [10] Natário presents
a quite general argument to the effect that in any generic warp spacetime, (Alcubierre,
Natário zero-expansion, and, yes, it even applies to Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg zero-vorticity
warp drives), there must be violations of either the SEC or the WEC. (Or you have the
trivial case of Minkowski space.) See his theorem 1.7.

– 23 –

SEC: Natário’s result can already be slightly improved in view of our comments
above: In any generic warp spacetime, (Alcubierre, Natário, and, yes, it even applies to
Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg), there must be violations of the SEC. (Or you have the trivial
case of Minkowski space.) We shall go into some detail in order to localise where and
when the SEC violations take place.
The key point is that Eulerian observers define a zero-vorticity congruence of timelike
geodesics, that by construction cannot have any focussing points. Now apply a variant
of the Raychaudhuri equation (timelike focussing theorem) [42, 101–107].
Explicit calculation has shown us, see equation (4.12), that for any warp drive spacetime:
ρ + 3p̄ = −


1
Ln K + tr K 2 .
4π

(7.18)

Thus if the SEC holds (implying ρ + 3p̄ ≥ 0) we have

Ln K + tr K 2 ≤ 0.

(7.19)


Ln K ≤ − tr K 2 .

(7.20)

Now split the extrinsic curvature into trace-free part Kijtf = Kij − 13 Kδij and trace. Then

So if K < 0, then it will be even more negative in the future. Similarly if K > 0,
then it must have been even more positive in the past. Noting that, acting on scalars,
Ln K = V a ∂a K = dK/dτ , we see that the Eulerian observers satisfy

upwards, from τ = τ0 to some τ > τ0 we have
1
K −1 (τ ) ≥ K(τ0 )−1 + (τ − τ0 ).
3

(7.26)

So if K(τ0 ) < 0, then there will be some finite proper time increment, less than 3/|K0 |,
at which K −1 → 0− implying K → −∞.
Integrating downwards, from τ = τ0 to some τ < τ0 we have
1
K0−1 ≥ K(τ )−1 + |τ − τ0 |.

So if K(τ0 ) > 0, then there will be some finite proper time decrement, less than 3/|K0 |,
at which K −1 → 0+ implying K → +∞.
Either way, this is in contradiction to the fact that the Eulerian observers define a
zero-vorticity congruence of timelike geodesics that by construction cannot have any
focussing points. So either K ≡ 0 identically, or whenever K(τ0 ) 6= 0 somewhere for
any arbitrary Eulerian observer, the SEC fails somewhere in the interval

(Of course we could relax the global condition in the ADM-like split in the warp drive.
However, this would imply either the formation of singularities in a finite time in the
region of non-zero extrinsic curvature—meaning the warp bubble would encounter it; or
we would have to save the situation by opting for CTCs [11], in many ways an even
worse situation for physics [88–93].)
Overall, this now gives us quite good control on where and when the SEC violations
take place. The special case where K ≡ 0 identically reduces to the Natário warp drive,
for which we had already argued that the SEC fails (as long as the extrinsic curvature
Kij is not identically zero everywhere in the spacetime).
Note that this argument for SEC violations does not require any asymptotic conditions

NEC: For the NEC we had already argued that the NEC requires ρ + p̄ ≥ 0, and we
have the explicit calculation (4.13):
ρ + p̄ =


1
−2Ln K + K 2 − 3 tr K 2 .
24π

(7.30)

So the NEC would require

2Ln K − K 2 + 3 tr K 2 ≤ 0.

(7.31)

But, in terms of the trace-free part of extrinsic curvature, we have
 1

tr K 2 = tr [K tf ]2 + K 2 .

(7.32)

So we can rewrite the NEC as

Ln K ≤ − tr [K tf ]2 .

(7.33)

That is, using Ln K = dK/dτ , and assuming the NEC:


(7.34)

Let us now take a moment to further explore equation (7.34). The τ here refers to
the proper time along an Eulerian observer’s trajectory. It represents, therefore, how
a particular Eulerian observer will see the trace of the extrinsic curvature where they
are located. Given the zero-vorticity nature of the Eulerian observers’ congruence, it is
known that at each spacetime point one and only one Eulerian observer will be present.
We might, therefore, associate an Eulerian observer to each point on a constant-time
spatial slice.
Keeping this in mind, let us now follow a particular Eulerian observer who is initially
sitting in a flat region far away from the warp bubble. Given the already mentioned
falloff conditions for warp drives, we have that Kij tends to zero at spatial infinity.
Therefore, as long as the observer is sufficiently distant from the warp bubble, Kij will
be as close to zero as the particular fall-off conditions allow.
Without any loss of generality, we might pick such an observer to be in the region
traversed by the warp drive as it moves from a certain origin to a specific destination
— also assumed to be sufficiently far away. In this particular scenario, the extrinsic
curvature as seen by such an observer must start and end up with values which approach

zero at spatial infinity — since they start and finish in an almost flat space.
Let us now return to equation (7.34). It tells us that, as long as the NEC is satisfied in
the generic Natário warp drive spacetime, the trace of the extrinsic curvature can never
increase. How does this apply to the particular Eulerian observer above?
In the situation just described, the trace as seen by the particular Eulerian observer will
naturally start arbitrarily close to zero, since they are in an approximately flat space. In
this way, once the warp drive passes, it can either decrease or stay the same. If is stays
the same we have only two possible explanations: either a zero expansion warp drive
passed by or no warp drive passed at all. Since we already proved the violation of the
NEC for the zero expansion warp drive case separately, let us now focus on the other
hypothesis, namely, that K decreases. Now, again, two possibilities arise: K becomes
negative or K becomes even closer to zero than it was in the asymptotically flat region.
Independently of the case, after the warp drive passes and proceeds sufficiently far away,
the observer will return to an asymptotically flat region, meaning that K increases as
it returns to its original value.6 This, however, is not allowed if the NEC is always
satisfied, as given by equation (7.34). This proves that the violation of the NEC is a
necessary condition for the spacetime to “restore its asymptotics” after a warp drive
passes through a particular point.
A delicate point must be discussed before this proof is called closed and complete: The
question regarding what happens to such a geodesic Eulerian observer when a warp drive
reaches them. Is the observer’s trajectory disturbed by the warp drive? Is this geodesic
dragged along so that it never leaves the bubble again? Gladly, all of these questions
were already addressed in a paper by Pfenning and Ford [94], where they analysed the
effect of the passage of a constant velocity warp bubble on an Eulerian observer. Any
observer passing through the bubble wall7 but not reaching a flat interior will behave in
the following way: As the front wall of the bubble reaches such Eulerian observers, their
trajectory acquires a “coordinate acceleration” in the direction of the bubble, relative
to observers at large distances.8 For a while, this is followed by a movement with nearly
constant speed, shown to be always smaller than the bubble’s speed. These observers
then finally decelerate, being left at rest as the bubble continues to go forward. In this
way, while being displaced in space along the trajectory of the bubble, no momentum is
transferred to these observers during the “collision”. Therefore, such Eulerian observers

Since we still have to assume that any contribution to Kij from the warp drive is sufficiently
localized.
7
We have to assume wall of finite size—but then again a wall of infinitesimal size would render the
metric distributional and thus unsuitable for standard GR, anyhow.
8
The Eulerian observers are geodesic, so the 4-acceleration is identically zero.

flat inner region will remain there as long as the bubble persists.
who were at rest before the arrival of the warp drive will finish as Eulerian observers
at rest after the bubble passes. Another more recent study [27] extended these results
to warp drives with non-constant velocities. An illustration of the Eulerian observers’
worldlines in this argument for the violation of the NEC can be found in figure 1.9
Let us summarise this argument again: Eulerian observers initially at rest, which eventually “collide” with the bubble wall—without, however, entering possible flat regions
inside the warp bubble—will exit the bubble, and will again reenter the asymptotically
flat space behind the bubble. The monotonicity implied by equation (7.34) then implies
a violation of the NEC somewhere along these Eulerian trajectories. It is, therefore,
proven that any warp drive in the generic Natário form will inevitably violate the NEC
as it moves through spacetime.
Note that this proof for NEC violations uses only the fact that warp drive contributions
are sufficiently localized — without any need to assume zero ADM mass or to invoke
an integration by parts.

Very nice illustrations of this can also be found in [95].

Discussion and conclusions

We have now demonstrated that all members of the general class of warp drives defined
by Natário [10] violate the NEC. This significantly extends previously known results.
This argument applies, in particular, to all three of the Alcubierre [9], Natário zeroexpansion [10], and Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg zero-vorticity [1, 3] warp drives, and also (for
slightly different reasons) to the model warp drives considered by Bobrick–Martire [2].
Because the NEC is violated then so are the WEC, SEC, and DEC.
Consequently, insofar as one wishes to continue to entertain the possibility of warp
drives as a real physical phenomenon, one has no choice but to face the violation of the
energy conditions head on. Several possibilities arise: (i) modify the theory of gravity,
(ii) modify the definition of warp drive, (iii) modify the energy conditions, (iv) appeal to
macroscopic quantum physics, (v) allow for singularities or CTCs (time travel). None
of these options are particularly palatable. All of these options have serious draw-backs.
Thus it is our melancholy duty to report that none of the recent claims of positive-mass
physical warp drives survive careful inspection of the proffered arguments.

A

“Spherically symmetric” warp drives

“Spherically symmetric” warp drives date back to the original article by Alcubierre [9].
Specifically, let us reconsider the explicit line element (2.12) and rephrase it as

2
ds2 = −dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz − v∗ (t) f (rs (x, y, z, t)) dt ,

(A.1)

where we set
rs (x, y, z, t) =

q

x2 + y 2 + (z − z∗ (t))2 ,

Z
z∗ (t) =

v∗ (t) dt,

(A.2)

and enforce both f (0) = 1 and f (∞) = 0. This represents a spherically symmetric
warp bubble, centred on the moving point (0, 0, z∗ (t)), with a shape function f (rs ) that
depends only on the Euclidean distance from the moving centre. We emphasize that
while the warp bubble is spherically symmetric the spacetime is not — there is certainly
a preferred axis due to the direction of motion of the warp bubble. (Hence the warp
bubble is spherically symmetric, but the spacetime is only “spherically symmetric”.)
At large spatial distances ds2 → −dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 , the usual representation of
Minkowski space, while at the centre of the warp drive
ds2 → −dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + (dz − v∗ (t)dt)2 .

– 29 –

(A.3)

Consider now the coordinate transformation
t̃ = t,

x̃ = x,

ỹ = y,

z̃ = z − z∗ (t),

(A.4)

which is designed to bring the warp bubble “to rest”. Then
dt̃ = dt,

dx̃ = dx,

dỹ = dy,

dz̃ = dz − v∗ (t) dt,

(A.5)

and the line element becomes
2
ds2 = −dt̃2 + dx̃2 + dỹ 2 + dz̃ + v∗ (t)[1 − f (rs )] dt̃ ,

(A.6)

p
where now rs = x̃2 + ỹ 2 + z̃ 2 is time independent. At the centre of the warp bubble
we now have ds2 → −dt̃2 + dx̃2 + dỹ 2 + dz̃ 2 , the usual representation of Minkowski
space, while at spatial infinity it is now the outside universe that is streaming by with
velocity −v∗ (t).
At spatial infinity the line element becomes
2
ds2 → −dt̃2 + dx̃2 + dỹ 2 + dz̃ + v∗ (t) dt̃ .

(A.7)

This is again Minkowski space, but now in “moving coordinates”. Note the “conservation”
of relative motion — either spatial infinity is standing still and the bubble is moving, or
the bubble is standing still and spatial infinity is moving [9, 10].
If one wishes to make the walls of the warp bubble thin, (but still of finite thickness),
this is a choice, not a necessity, then one might pick

1
f (rs ) = smooth

0

rs ≤ rinner ,
rs ∈ [rinner , router ],
rs ≥ router .

(A.8)

If one makes this choice, then one needs to enforce router > rinner to keep the metric
continuous. A discontinuity in the metric leads to delta functions in the Christoffel
symbols, squares of delta functions in the Riemann tensor, and cubes of delta functions
in the Bianchi identities. Even when working with the Israel–Lanczos–Sen thin-shell
formalism (the junction condition formalism) one needs to keep the metric piecewise
differentiable, C 1− , since then the Christoffel symbols at worst contain step functions
and the Riemann tensor and Bianchi identities at worst contain delta functions.

– 30 –

The reason for being so explicit is that in reference [2] the authors present a deeply
flawed discussion of spherically symmetric warp drives. In their implementation of
spherically symmetric warp drives the warp bubble is certainly at rest, but in addition
their choice of asymptotic boundary conditions also forces the warp bubble to be at
rest with respect to spatial infinity. This defeats the whole purpose of a warp drive.
Furthermore, these authors take the interior of the warp bubble to be a portion of flat
Minkowski space, the wall of the warp bubble to be a non-negative density barotropic
and isotropic fluid, and the exterior region to be a portion of Schwarzschild spacetime.
They then attempt to apply the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov (TOV) equation to the
bubble wall. But under the set of assumptions they are imposing (zero pressure at
the inner edge of the bubble wall, zero pressure at the outer edge of the bubble wall,
non-negative energy density within the bubble wall, and a barotropic equation of state)
the unique solution to the TOV is the trivial solution p(r) = 0 = ρ(r), and the mass of
the exterior region must be zero. Thus their specific model (as presented in [2]) just
reduces, globally, to flat Minkowski space — it is not a warp drive.
These authors [2] also assert that both Alcubierre [9] and Natário [10] must necessarily
“truncate” their warp fields, forcing them to be exactly Minkowski space, at some finite
distance from the centre of the warp bubble. This is simply not an accurate reflection
of what is actually done in those references [9, 10]. Specifically, in Alcubierre’s original
article [9, equation (6)] the concrete realization of the shape function f (rs ) he chooses,
see equation (A.8), uses tanh functions and so does not have compact support. In
this terminology, Alcubierre sets rinner = 0 and router = ∞, which is certainly not
a truncation. Unfortunately this terminology of “truncation” has been uncritically
adopted by subsequent authors [3].
The authors of [2] also assert in passing, see their section (5.2), that the Alcubierre warp
drive [9] does not satisfy the continuity equations. They also assert that the velocity
of the Alcubierre warp bubble cannot be time dependent, claiming a violation of the
conservation of momentum. These statements are both false, and seem to arise (at
best) from adopting a naive Newtonian viewpoint. What Alcubierre has actually done
is to “reverse engineer” the warp drive — once one writes down a suitable metric, (at
least C 1− , piecewise differentiable), one simply calculates the Einstein tensor to find
what the stress-energy is that would be required to support that spacetime geometry.
The continuity equation is automatically enforced via the Bianchi identities, and there
is no difficulty in making the velocity of the Alcubierre warp bubble time-dependent.
(Reference [3] seems to repeat this error in their discussion. Reference [1] is more careful
in this regard, setting the 3-velocity of their model warp bubble constant for simplicity,
but without making any claim as to necessity.)

– 31 –

Overall, while the idea of a “spherically symmetric” warp drive is certainly well-defined
and useful, the specific implementation of this notion in reference [2] is not a successful
one, and is not useful.

B

Warp drives beyond the generic Natário framework

There are two somewhat more general warp drive spacetimes that do not fall into
Natário’s general classification [10], and are incompatible with the Alcubierre, Natário,
and Lentz/Fell–Heisenberg warp drives. These more general warp drives are obtained by
either relaxing the condition that the lapse be unity, (so N (x, y, z, t) 6= 1), or relaxing
the condition that the spatial slices be flat, (so gij 6= δij ). See reference [29] which
discusses the case N 6= 1, and reference [17] which permits the spatial slices to be
conformally flat gij = e2θ(x,y,z,t) δij rather than Riemann flat.
Unhelpfully, in appendices A.1 and A.2 of reference [2] those authors incorrectly claim
that both of these more general spacetimes can, by a coordinate transformation, be
brought into Alcubierre form. The simplest way to see that both these claims are
wrong is to set the flow vector to zero. The claims made in appendices A.1 and A.2 of
reference [2] then reduce to the claims that the line elements
ds2 = −N (x, y, z, t)2 dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,

(B.1)

ds2 = −dt2 + e2θ(x,y,z,t) {dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 },

(B.2)

and
are actually Riemann flat. This is manifestly incorrect. What has gone wrong? The
transformations these authors invoke are just not coordinate transformations. For a
transformation dxa → dx̄a = J a b dxb to actually be a coordinate transformation the
critical requirement is that J a [b,c] = 0. (Additionally, one would want det(J a b ) 6= 0,
except on sets of measure zero.) While the transformations made in appendices A.1 and
A.2 of reference [2] satisfy the determinant condition, they fail the more basic J a [b,c] = 0
condition; they are simply not coordinate transformations.
For our purposes then it means that the non-unit-lapse and van den Broeck warp drive
spacetimes cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. There are other problematic issues
with both of these models, but they are physically different from the Natário class [10],
(unit lapse, spatially flat 3-geometry), and must be directly addressed using different
techniques.

C

Some defective warp drives

Some of the recently proposed warp drive spacetimes are defective for other reasons.
For instance, in the first explicit example in reference [3] the velocity potential Φ is
certainly C 0 but is only piecewise differentiable, C 1− . That is, the flow ~v = ∇Φ is
discontinuous, which implies that the metric is discontinuous. This then leads to delta
functions in the Christoffel symbols, squares of delta functions in the Riemann tensor,
and cubes of delta functions in the Bianchi identities. This is mathematically and
physically not viable.
In their second explicit example, equation (9) of versions 1 and 2; equation (11) of
versions 3 and 4 of reference [3], the velocity potential Φ is C ∞ , except p
possibly at the
centre of the spacetime, but suffers other problems. If one takes r = x2 + y 2 + z 2 ,
then even at its most general their velocity potential is of the qualitative form
Φ(x, y, z) = F (r, σ(x, y, z)) + v∗ z.

(C.1)

Then
~v = ∇Φ(x, y, z) = ∂r F (r, σ(x, y, z)) r̂ + ∂σ F (r, σ(x, y, z)) ∇σ + v∗ ẑ.

(C.2)

But then, in their specific example, they do the equivalent of settting σ(x, y, z) → 1,
and v∗ → 0, thereby enforcing spherical symmetry. That is Φ(x, y, z) → F (r, 1), which
is a function of r only. But then
~v = ∇Φ →

∂F (r, 1)
r̂.
∂r

(C.3)

So their flow vector is always pointing radially outwards/inwards. This is simply not
viable for describing a warp drive spacetime.

Oddly enough, consider Φ(x, y, z) = 2 2mr = 2 2m 4 x2 + y 2 + z 2 , so that

(C.5)

This is the de Sitter spacetime (in Painlevé–Gullstrand form, converted to Cartesian
coordinates, with Λ = 3/`2 ). This is not a warp drive spacetime.
But the central issue is this: Even if you pick a flow vector of the form
~v = f (r) r̂ + v∗ ẑ,

(C.6)

which at least has a hope of representing a moving warp bubble, then calculating and
checking the non-negativity of the Eulerian energy density ρ by itself tells you next to
nothing regarding satisfaction of the WEC. To test satisfaction of the WEC one would
need to calculate all of the principal pressures pi and then check whether all of the
combinations ρ + pi were non-negative.
In reference [1] the claim is made that the author can self-consistently find a warp drive
configuration that is sourced by a perfect fluid plasma (satisfying the WEC and so also
the NEC) plus electromagnetic Maxwell stress-energy (satisfying all of NEC, WEC,
SEC, and DEC). So if this claim were to be true, if these models truly were solutions of
the Einstein equations with the specified source, one would have a warp drive spacetime
satisfying the NEC, which we have just shown to be impossible. What has gone wrong?
The point here is that the author of [1] has not actually solved the Einstein equations,
he has only solved part of the Einstein equations — for the density, flux, and trace of
the stress. This is not enough to obtain a valid solution of the Einstein equations — the
author would also need to consider the remaining trace-free part Tij − 31 (Tkl δ kl )gij of
the stress tensor.

D

Final considerations regarding recent warp drive proposals

We would like to conclude by explicitly explaining (if not yet mentioned) why each of
the recent warp drive proposals have failed in their claims.
Starting with [1], the author has claimed to have found a warp drive solution which
would not violate the WEC. This is actually an incorrect claim since the author has never
actually solved the Einstein equations. By imposing a warp drive metric, it is clear from
equations (3.19), (3.20) and (3.21) that all of the components of the energy momentum
tensor are already determined, without much freedom to play around. This is called a
reverse engineering process. Once you define your metric, your energy momentum tensor
follows directly from it. The author, however, imposes not only the metric, but also an
– 34 –

energy momentum tensor — therefore imposing both sides of the Einstein equations
without ever verifying if they are indeed an equation or not. Hence, they haven’t only
not found a solution which satisfies the WEC, they haven’t found a solution at all.
Proceeding with [2], their warp drives are divided into two classes: “General spherically
symmetric warp drives”, which we already discussed in appendix A, and “Axisymmetric
warp drives with a general internal region” in which they haven’t found any metric
satisfying the WEC. In this way, their only “warp drive” which satisfies the WEC is
actually not a warp drive metric at all. It is a static spherically symmetric spacetime,
therefore being reduced to either Minkowski or Schwarzschild. Furthermore, their
claims about Alcubierre’s warp drive requiring negative energy due to the “artificial”
matching rate for the clocks inside and outside the warp drive follows directly from
their rediscovery of the existence of time delays in Schwarzschild spacetimes, which they
believe to be a warp drive.
Finally, in [3], their main issue reduces to “proving” the WEC by calculating the energy
density for a unique class of observers – the Eulerian observers. As mentioned already,
to prove the WEC one needs to prove that the energy density is positive for all time-like
observers and, proving only for one class of observers simply doesn’t prove anything.
Furthermore, the specific examples provided by them have a great deal of problems, as
already explained in appendix C.
The series of articles by Santos-Pereira, Abreu, and Ribeiro [4–8], has other issues.
Specifically:
• Their perfect fluid warp drives (dust, non-zero pressure, non-zero pressure with
cosmological constant) are just Riemann-flat Minkowski space in disguise.
• Their anisotropic fluid warp drive (“parameterized perfect fluid” warp drive) is
less trivial, but is still seriously diseased.
• Their charged dust warp drive is less trivial, but is still seriously diseased.
(Among other things, the calculation of energy density is deeply flawed, confusing
T00 and T 00 .)
• Their “cosmological” warp drive is not cosmological.
We shall go into some detail in an attempt to make the situation clear and transparent.
The earliest paper [4] analyzes the Alcubierre warp drive with a stress-energy that is pure
comoving Eulerian dust. Now this is a very strong constraint, and one quickly deduces
that the energy density of the dust is zero. This means that the entire stress-energy

– 35 –

tensor is identically zero; so one is looking for vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations
for an Alcubierre warp drive. But the set of vacuum solutions in an Alcubierre warp
drive framework is extremely limited — in fact once one completely satisfies all the
Einstein equations the only such solution is Riemann-flat Minkowski space (which,
viewed as a warp drive, is trivial).
The anisotropic fluid (“parameterized perfect fluid”) studied in [5] has the defect that
once one completely satisfies all the Einstein equations the “warp drive” is infinitely
wide in the transverse directions — so it is not a warp “bubble”, the warp field stretches
all the way across the universe in the y and z directions; one is trying to accelerate an
entire “slab” of spacetime in the x direction. Furthermore, the Eulerian energy density,
flux, and pressure in the direction of motion are zero, the pressures transverse to the
direction of motion are equal and possibly nonzero — this would then certainly violate
the DEC.
For the charged dust solution of [6] there is a technical error in identifying the energy
density. The physically interesting quantity is ρ = T 00 = T ab (−1; 0, 0, 0)a (−1; 0, 0, 0)b ,
where the 4-covector (−1; 0, 0, 0)a is always timelike and future pointing (it is in fact the 4velocity of an Eulerian observer). In contrast the quantity T00 = Tab (1; 0, 0, 0)a (1; 0, 0, 0)b
is not physically interesting since the 4-vector (1; 0, 0, 0)a is timelike only for a limited
range of warp velocities; in fact, this 4-vector becomes spacelike exactly when the warp
bubble motion becomes superluminal.
For the “cosmological” solution of [7] the attempt at including a cosmological constant
is at best a redefinition of terms in the stress-energy tensor. For instance, the definition
of Einstein tensor adopted in [7] is not the usual one, which is unhelpful. Furthermore,
given that the entire calculation is taking place within the framework of the generic
Alcubierre metric, we know the spacetime is asymptotically flat; it does not match
(anti)de Sitter at large distances, so it is not a “cosmological” warp bubble.
In all of these situations [4–8], one is working within the framework of the generic
Alcubierre metric, so we know from first principles that energy condition violations
must be present.
