Abstract
Four-dimensional Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is likely to be an asymptotically safe theory which is applicable at arbitrarily small distance scales. On
sub-Planckian distances it predicts that spacetime is a fractal with an effective dimensionality of 2. The original argument leading to this result was based upon
the anomalous dimension of Newton’s constant. In the present paper we demonstrate that also the spectral dimension equals 2 microscopically, while it is equal to
4 on macroscopic scales. This result is an exact consequence of asymptotic safety
and does not rely on any truncation. Contact is made with recent Monte Carlo
simulations.

Introduction

Soon after the detailed investigation of Quantum Einstein Gravity [1]-[17] had begun and
it had become clear that the theory is likely to be nonperturbatively renormalizable or
“asymptotically safe” [8, 3, 5, 6] it was observed [3, 5] that it predicts a fractal spacetime structure at sub-Planckian distances whose effective dimensionality equals 2. On
the technical side, a key tool in the nonperturbative investigation of Quantum Einstein
Gravity (QEG) was the effective average action and its associated exact renormalization
group (RG) equation which had been developed in [18, 19] and was first applied to gravity
in [1]. (For general reviews see [20],[21].)
In QEG, the effective average action Γk [gµν ] defines an infinite set of effective field
theories, valid near a variable mass scale k which is introduced as an infrared (IR) cutoff
and varies between k = 0 and k = ∞ [1]. Intuitively speaking, the solution hgµν ik of the
scale dependent field equation
δΓk
[hgik ] = 0
δgµν (x)

(1.1)

can be interpreted as the metric averaged over (Euclidean) spacetime volumes of a linear
extension ℓ which typically is of the order of 1/k. Knowing the scale dependence of Γk ,
i.e. the renormalization group trajectory k 7→ Γk , we can in principle follow the solution
hgµν ik from the ultraviolet (k → ∞) to the infrared (k → 0).
It is an important feature of this approach that the infinitely many equations of (1.1),
one for each scale k, are valid simultaneously. They all refer to the same physical system,
the “quantum spacetime”, but describe its effective metric structure on different scales.
An observer using a “microscope” with a resolution ≈ k −1 will perceive the universe to be
a Riemannian manifold with metric hgµν ik . At every fixed k, hgµν ik is a smooth classical
metric. But since the quantum spacetime is characterized by the infinity of equations
(1.1) with k = 0, · · · , ∞ it can acquire very nonclassical and in particular fractal features.
Let us describe more precisely what it means to “average” over Euclidean spacetime
volumes. The quantity we can freely tune is the IR cutoff scale k, and the “resolving

1

power” of the microscope, henceforth denoted ℓ, is in general a complicated function of
k. (In flat space, ℓ ≈ 1/k.) In order to understand the relationship between ℓ and k we
must recall some steps from the construction of Γk [gµν ] in ref. [1].
The effective average action is obtained by introducing an IR cutoff into the pathintegral over all metrics, gauge fixed by means of a background gauge fixing condition.
Even without a cutoff the resulting effective action Γ[gµν ; ḡµν ] depends on two metrics,
the expectation value of the quantum field, gµν , and the background field ḡµν . This is a
standard technique, and it is well known [23] that the functional Γ[gµν ] ≡ Γ[gµν ; ḡµν = gµν ]
obtained by equating the two metrics can be used to generate the 1PI Green’s functions
of the theory.
The IR cutoff of the average action is implemented by first expressing the functional
integral over all metrics in terms of eigenmodes of D̄ 2 , the covariant Laplacian formed with
the aid of the background metric ḡµν . Then a suppression term is introduced which damps
the contribution of all −D̄ 2 -modes with eigenvalues smaller than k 2 . Following the usual
steps [20] this leads to the scale dependent functional Γk [gµν ; ḡµν ], and the action with
one argument again obtains by equating the two metrics: Γk [gµν ] ≡ Γk [gµν ; ḡµν = gµν ].
It is this action which appears in (1.1). Because of the identification of the two metrics
we see that it is basically the eigenmodes of D̄ 2 = D 2 , constructed from the argument of
Γk [g], which are cut off at k 2 . Since hgµν ik is the corresponding stationary point, we can
say that the metric hgµν ik applies to the situation where only the quantum fluctuations

of −D 2 (hgµν ik ) with eigenvalues larger than k 2 are integrated out. Therefore there is a
complicated interrelation between the metric and the scale at which it provides an effective
description: The covariant Laplacian which ultimately decides about which modes are
integrated out is constructed from the “on shell” configuration hgµν ik , so it is k-dependent
by itself already.
From these remarks it is clear now how to obtain the “resolving power” ℓ for a given
k, at least in principle. We take the Laplacian −D 2 (hgµν ik ), solve its eigenvalue problem,

and then analyze in particular the properties of the eigenfunction(s) with eigenvalue k 2

2

(or near k 2 in the case of a discrete spectrum). Loosely speaking, this eigenfunction is the
last one integrated out. As a consequence, the “averaging” scale is crucially determined
by “how fast” this eigenfunction varies over spacetime. Let us assume, for instance, this
eigenfunction is oscillatory with a coordinate period ∆x. Then, again by using hgµν ik ,
we compute the physical proper length this period corresponds to, and this is then what
determines the resolution ℓ.
In general the eigenfunction at k 2 will have a complicated x-dependence, and therefore
also the typical scales on which it varies are position dependent. Moreover, at a given
point, the scale of significant variation will be direction dependent (anisotropic). Therefore the resolving power ℓ = ℓ(k; x, n) is a complicated function in general, depending
parametrically on points (xµ ) and directions (nµ ) on spacetime. It is clear that these
notions can be made precise only in concrete examples and must be defined on a case by
case basis.
We emphasize, however, that using the averaged metric itself to define the scale it is
averaged over is not a vicious circle, but rather is exactly as it must be in a background
independent approach to the quantization of gravity.
In a somewhat simplified form, the construction of a quantum spacetime within QEG
can be summarized as follows. We start from a fixed RG trajectory k 7→ Γk , derive its
effective field equations at each k, and solve them. The resulting quantum mechanical
counterpart of a classical spacetime is specified by the infinity of Riemannian metrics
{hgµν ik |k = 0, · · · , ∞}. While the totality of these metrics contains all physical information, the parameter k is only a book keeping device a priori. In a second step, it
can be given a physical interpretation by relating it to the (proper) length scale of the
averaging procedure: One constructs the Laplacian −D 2 (hgµν ik ), diagonalizes it, looks

how rapidly its k 2 -eigenfunction varies, and “measures” the length of typical variations
with the metric hgµν ik itself. By solving the resulting ℓ = ℓ(k) for k = k(ℓ) we can in
principle reinterprete the metric hgµν ik as referring to a microscope with a known position
and direction dependent resolving power. The price we have to pay for the background

3

independence is that we cannot freely choose ℓ directly but rather k only.
The first difficult step in this construction program consists in finding the RG trajectories. The running action Γk [gµν ] is given by an exact functional RG equation [1]. In
practice it is usually solved on a truncated theory space. In the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, for instance, Γk is approximated by a functional of the form
Z
√ 
−1
Γk [g] = (16πGk )
d4 x g −R(g) + 2λ̄k

(1.2)

involving a running Newton constant Gk and cosmological constant λ̄k . Their k-dependence
can be obtained from the RG equation projected onto the truncation subspace. The βfunctions for the dimensionless couplings gk ≡ k 2 Gk and λk ≡ λ̄k /k 2 were first obtained in
[1]. Remarkably, they turned out to possess a simultaneous zero at a non-Gaussian fixed
point (NGFP) (g∗ , λ∗ ) which has just the right properties needed for the nonperturbative
renormalizability of QEG along the lines of Weinberg’s [22] ideas on “asymptotic safety”
[8]. It was argued [3, 5, 6] that the NGFP is likely to exist also in the un-truncated, full
theory and allows for the construction of a consistent and predictive microscopic theory
of quantum gravity valid at arbitrarily small distances even.
One of the highly intriguing conclusions we reached in refs. [3, 5] was that the effective
dimensionality of spacetime is scale dependent. It equals 4 at macroscopic distances
(ℓ ≫ ℓPl ) but, near ℓ ≈ ℓPl , it gets dynamically reduced to the value 2. For ℓ ≪ ℓPl
spacetime is, in a precise sense [3], a 2-dimensional fractal.
In ref. [24] the specific form of the graviton propagator on this fractal was applied in a
cosmological context. It was argued that it gives rise to a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of
primordial geometry fluctuations, perhaps responsible for the CMBR spectrum observed
today.
In refs. [24]-[32] various types of “RG improvements” were used to explore possible
manifestations of the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters.
Along a quite different line of investigation, considerable progress has been made
recently towards defining a quantum theory of gravity as the continuum limit of a discrete

4

model of statistical mechanics. Performing comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations within
the framework of causal (Lorentzian) triangulated geometries [33], Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz
and Loll [34]-[36] collected strong evidence indicating that these models can describe
universes which are extended both in space and time and are 4-dimensional on large
scales. In particular the above authors “measured” numerically the spectral and Hausdorff
dimensions of the spacetimes and their time slices, respectively. Remarkably, they, too,
find that the (spectral) dimension Ds of the spacetime reduces dynamically from Ds ≈ 4
at large distances to Ds ≈ 2 on small length scales.
While until recently it has been difficult to compare the continuum theory to the
discrete causal triangulation approach, the new Monte Carlo results suggest that they
might be closely related, possibly representing the same “universality class”.
In our original argument [3] we determined the effective dimensionality of the fractal
realized at sub-Planckian distances (in the asymptotic scaling regime of the NGFP) from
the anomalous dimension ηN at the NGFP. A priori this definition of an effective dimensionality is different from the one used in the Monte Carlo simulations. It is the main
purpose of the present paper to apply the reasoning from [3, 5] to the definition of the
effective dimension which was employed by Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz and Loll [36], namely
the spectral dimension Ds .
We shall demonstrate that asymptotically safe QEG does indeed predict Ds = 4
at ℓ ≫ ℓPl and Ds = 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl . (The Planck length and mass are defined as

1/2
ℓPl ≡ m−1
.)
Pl ≡ G(k = 0)

As a preparation we review and extend the discussion of refs. [3, 5] in Section 2, and
in Section 3 we compute the spectral dimension of the QEG spacetimes.

QEG spacetimes under the microscope

For simplicity we use the Einstein-Hilbert truncation to start with, and we consider spacetimes with classical dimensionality d = 4. The corresponding RG trajectories were com-

5

pletely classified and determined numerically in [4]. The physically relevant ones, for
k → ∞, all approach the NGFP at (g∗ , λ∗ ) so that the dimensionful quantities run according to
Gk ≈ g∗ /k 2

λ̄k ≈ λ∗ k 2

,

(2.1)

The behavior (2.1) is realized in the asymptotic scaling regime k ≫ mPl . Near k = mPl
the trajectories cross over towards the Gaussian fixed point at g = λ = 0, and then run
towards negative, vanishing, and positive values of λ, respectively.
Since in this paper we are interested only in the limiting cases of very small and
very large distances the following caricature of a RG trajectory will be sufficient. We
assume that Gk and λ̄k behave as in (2.1) for k ≫ mPl , and that they assume constant
values for k ≪ mPl . The precise interpolation between the two regimes could be obtained
numerically [4] but will not be needed here.
The argument of ref. [5] concerning the fractal nature of the QEG spacetimes was
as follows. Within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation of theory space, the effective field
equations (1.1) happen to coincide with the ordinary Einstein equation, but with Gk and
λ̄k replacing the classical constants. Without matter,
Rµν (hgik ) = λ̄k hgµν ik

(2.2)

Since in absence of dimensionful constants of integration λ̄k is the only quantity in this
equation which sets a scale, every solution to (2.2) has a typical radius of curvature
p
rc (k) ∝ 1/ λ̄k . (For instance, the maximally symmetric S 4 -solution has the radius
p
rc = r = 3/λ̄k .) If we want to explore the spacetime structure at a fixed length scale
ℓ we should use the action Γk [gµν ] at k = 1/ℓ because with this functional a tree level

analysis is sufficient to describe the essential physics at this scale, including the relevant
quantum effects. Hence, when we observe the spacetime with a microscope of resolution
ℓ, we will see an average radius of curvature given by rc (ℓ) ≡ rc (k = 1/ℓ). Once ℓ is
2
smaller than the Planck length ℓPl ≡ m−1
Pl we are in the fixed point regime where λ̄k ∝ k

6

so that rc (k) ∝ 1/k, or
rc (ℓ) ∝ ℓ

(2.3)

Thus, when we look at the structure of spacetime with a microscope of resolution ℓ ≪ ℓPl ,
the average radius of curvature which we measure is proportional to the resolution itself.
If we want to probe finer details and decrease ℓ we automatically decrease rc and hence
increase the average curvature. Spacetime seems to be more strongly curved at small
distances than at larger ones. The scale-free relation (2.3) suggests that at distances
below the Planck length the QEG spacetime is a special kind of fractal with a self-similar
structure. It has no intrinsic scale because in the fractal regime, i.e. when the RG
trajectory is still close to the NGFP, the parameters which usually set the scales of the
gravitational interaction, G and λ̄, are not yet “frozen out”. This happens only later on,
somewhere half way between the non-Gaussian and the Gaussian fixed point, at a scale
of the order of mPl .
Below this scale, Gk and λ̄k stop running and, as a result, rc (k) becomes independent
of k so that rc (ℓ) = const for ℓ ≫ ℓPl . In this regime hgµν ik is k-independent, indicating
that the macroscopic spacetime is describable by a single smooth, classical Riemannian
manifold.
The above argument made essential use of the proportionality ℓ ∝ 1/k. In the fixed
point regime it follows trivially from the fact that there exist no relevant dimensionful
parameters so that 1/k is the only length scale one can form. The algorithm for the
determination of ℓ(k) described in the Introduction yields the same answer.
It is easy to make the k-dependence of hgµν ik explicit. Picking an arbitrary reference

scale k0 we may rewrite (2.2) as [λ̄k0 /λ̄k ] Rµν (hgik ) = λ̄k0 δνµ . Since Rµν (c g) = c−1 Rµν (g)
for any constant c > 0, this relation implies that the average metric scales as
hgµν (x)ik = [λ̄k0 /λ̄k ] hgµν (x)ik0

(2.4)

hg µν (x)ik = [λ̄k /λ̄k0 ] hg µν (x)ik0

(2.5)

and its inverse according to

7

These relations are valid provided the family of solutions considered exists for all scales
between k0 and k, and λ̄k has the same sign always.
As we discussed in ref. [3] the QEG spacetime has an effective dimensionality which
is k-dependent and hence noninteger in general. Our discussion in [3] was based upon
R√
the anomalous dimension ηN of the operator
g R. It is defined as ηN ≡ −k ∂k ln ZN k

where ZN k ∝ 1/Gk is the wavefunction renormalization of the metric [1]. In a sense

which we shall make more precise in a moment, the effective dimensionality of spacetime
equals 4 + ηN . The RG trajectories of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation (within its domain
of validity) have ηN ≈ 0 for k → 01 and ηN ≈ −2 for k → ∞, the smooth change by
two units occuring near k ≈ mPl . As a consequence, the effective dimensionality is 4 for
ℓ ≫ ℓPl and 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl .
In fact, the UV fixed point has an anomalous dimension η ≡ ηN (g∗ , λ∗ ) = −2. We
can use this information in order to determine the momentum dependence of the dressed
graviton propagator for momenta p2 ≫ m2Pl . Expanding the Γk of (1.2) about flat space

and omitting the standard tensor structures we find the inverse propagator Gek (p)−1 ∝

ZN (k) p2 . The conventional dressed propagator e
G(p) contained in Γ ≡ Γk=0 obtains from
the exact Gek in the limit k → 0. For p2 > k 2 ≫ m2Pl the actual cutoff scale is the physical
p
momentum p2 itself2 so that the k-evolution of Gek (p) stops at the threshold k = p2 .
Therefore


p 
e −1 ∝ ZN k = p2 p2 ∝ (p2 )1− η2
G(p)

(2.6)

because ZN (k) ∝ k −η when η ≡ −∂t ln ZN is (approximately) constant. In d dimensions,

e
and for η 6= 2 − d, the Fourier transform of G(p)
∝ 1/(p2 )1−η/2 yields the following
propagator in position space:

G(x; y) ∝
1

1
|x − y|d−2+η

.

(2.7)

In the case of type IIIa trajectories [4, 31] the macroscopic k-value is still far above kterm , i.e. in the

“GR regime” described in [31].
2
See Section 1 of ref. [29] for a detailed discussion of “decoupling” phenomena of this kind.

8

This form of the propagator is well known from the theory of critical phenomena, for
instance. (In the latter case it applies to large distances.) Eq. (2.7) is not valid directly
e = 1/p4 which has the
at the NGFP. For d = 4 and η = −2 the dressed propagator is G(p)

following representation in position space:
G(x; y) = −

1
ln (µ |x − y|) .
8π 2

(2.8)

Here µ is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a mass. Obviously (2.8) has the
same form as a 1/p2 -propagator in 2 dimensions.
Slightly away from the NGFP, before other physical scales intervene, the propagator is
of the familiar type (2.7) which shows that the quantity ηN has the standard interpretation
of an anomalous dimension in the sense that fluctuation effects modify the decay properties
of G so as to correspond to a spacetime of effective dimensionality 4 + ηN .
Thus the properties of the RG trajectories imply a remarkable dimensional reduction:
Spacetime, probed by a “graviton” with p2 ≪ m2Pl is 4-dimensional, but it appears to be
2-dimensional for a graviton with p2 ≫ m2Pl [3].

It is interesting to note that in d classical dimensions, where the macroscopic spacetime
is d-dimensional, the anomalous dimension at the fixed point is η = 2 − d. Therefore, for
any d, the dimensionality of the fractal as implied by ηN is d + η = 2 [3, 5].

The spectral dimension

In this section we determine the spectral dimension Ds of the QEG spacetimes. This
particular definition of a fractal dimension is borrowed from the theory of diffusion processes on fractals [37] and is easily adapted to the quantum gravity context [38, 36]. In
particular it has been used in the Monte Carlo studies mentioned in the Introduction.
Let us study the diffusion of a scalar test particle on a d-dimensional classical Euclidean
manifold with a fixed smooth metric gµν (x). The corresponding heat-kernel Kg (x, x′ ; T )
giving the probability for the particle to diffuse from x′ to x during the fictitious diffusion

9

time T satisfies the heat equation
∂T Kg (x, x′ ; T ) = ∆g Kg (x, x′ ; T )

(3.1)

where ∆g ≡ D 2 denotes the scalar Laplacian: ∆g φ ≡ g −1/2 ∂µ (g 1/2 g µν ∂ν φ). The heatkernel is a matrix element of the operator exp(T ∆g ). In the random walk picture its
trace per unit volume,
Pg (T ) ≡ V

−1

Z

dd x

p

g(x) Kg (x, x; T ) ≡ V −1 Tr exp(T ∆g ) ,

has the interpretation of an average return probability. (Here V ≡

(3.2)

dd x g denotes the

total volume.) It is well known that Pg possesses an asymptotic expansion (for T → 0)
P
n
of the form Pg (T ) = (4πT )−d/2 ∞
n=0 An T . For an infinite flat space, for instance, it
reads Pg (T ) = (4πT )−d/2 for all T . Thus, knowing the function Pg , one can recover the
dimensionality of the target manifold as the T -independent logarithmic derivative
d = −2

d ln Pg (T )
d ln T

(3.3)

This formula can also be used for curved spaces and spaces with finite volume V provided
T is not taken too large [36].
In QEG where we functionally integrate over all metrics it is natural to replace Pg (T )
by its expectation value. Symbolically,
Z
P (T ) ≡ hPγ (T )i ≡ Dγ DC D C̄ Pγ (T ) e−Sbare [γ,C,C̄]

(3.4)

Here γµν denotes the microscopic metric and Sbare is the bare action with the gauge fixing
terms and the pieces containing the ghosts C and C̄ included. Note that (3.4) does
not contain any IR cutoff; it is the ordinary (k = 0) expectation value with all modes
integrated out. In QEG the functional Sbare is given by the fixed point action. Given
P (T ), the spectral dimension of the quantum spacetime is defined in analogy with (3.3):
Ds = −2

d ln P (T )
d ln T

10

(3.5)

Let us now evaluate the expectation value (3.4) using the average action method.
The fictitious diffusion process takes place on a “manifold” which, at every fixed scale,
is described by a smooth Riemannian metric hgµν ik . While the situation appears to be
classical at fixed k, nonclassical features emerge in the regime with nontrivial RG running
since there the metric depends on the scale at which the spacetime structure is probed.
The nonclassical features are encoded in the properties of the diffusion operator. Denoting the covariant Laplacians corresponding to the metrics hgµν ik and hgµν ik0 by ∆(k)
and ∆(k0 ), respectively, eqs. (2.4) and (2.5) imply that they are related by
∆(k) = [λ̄k /λ̄k0 ] ∆(k0 )

(3.6)

When k, k0 ≫ mPl we have, for example,
∆(k) = (k/k0 )2 ∆(k0 )

(3.7)

Recalling that the average action Γk defines an effective field theory at the scale k we
have that hO(γµν )i ≈ O(hgµν ik ) if the operator O involves typical covariant momenta of
the order k and hgµν ik solves eq. (1.1). In the following we exploit this relationship for
the RHS of the diffusion equation, O = ∆γ Kγ (x, x′ ; T ). It is crucial here to correctly
identify the relevant scale k.
If the diffusion process involves (approximately) only a small interval of scales near k
over which λ̄k does not change much the corresponding heat equation contains the ∆(k)
for this specific, fixed value of k:
∂T K(x, x′ ; T ) = ∆(k)K(x, x′ ; T )

(3.8)

Denoting the eigenvalues of −∆(k0 ) by En and the corresponding eigenfunctions by φn ,
this equation is solved by
K(x, x′ ; T ) =

X
n



φn (x) φn (x′ ) exp − F (k 2 ) En T

(3.9)

Here we introduced the convenient notation F (k 2 ) ≡ λ̄k /λ̄k0 . Knowing this propagation kernel we can time-evolve any initial probability distribution p(x; 0) according to

11

p
g0 (x′ ) K(x, x′ ; T ) p(x′ ; 0) with g0 the determinant of hgµν ik0 . If the
P
initial distribution has an eigenfunction expansion of the form p(x; 0) = n Cn φn (x) we
p(x; T ) =

R

d4 x′

obtain

p(x; T ) =



Cn φn (x) exp − F (k 2 ) En T

(3.10)

If the Cn ’s are significantly different from zero only for a single eigenvalue EN , we are
dealing with a single-scale problem. In the usual spirit of effective field theories we would
then identify k 2 = EN as the relevant scale at which the running couplings are to be
evaluated.
However, in general the Cn ’s are different from zero over a wide range of eigenvalues.
In this case we face a multiscale problem where different modes φn probe the spacetime
on different length scales.
If ∆(k0 ) corresponds to flat space, say, the eigenfunctions φn ≡ φp are plane waves

with momentum pµ , and they resolve structures on a length scale ℓ of order 1/|p|. Hence,
√
in terms of the eigenvalue En ≡ Ep = p2 the resolution is ℓ ≈ 1/ En . This suggests that
when the manifold is probed by a mode with eigenvalue En it “sees” the metric hgµν ik for
√
√
the scale k = En . Actually the identification k = En is correct also for curved space
since, in the construction of Γk , the parameter k is introduced precisely as a cutoff in the
spectrum of the covariant Laplacian.
Therefore we conclude that under the spectral sum of (3.10) we must use the scale
k 2 = En which depends explicitly on the resolving power of the corresponding mode.

Likewise, in eq. (3.9), F (k 2 ) is to be interpreted as F (En ). Thus we obtain the traced
propagation kernel

It is convenient to choose k0 as a macroscopic scale in a regime where there are no
strong RG effects any more.

12

Furthermore, let us assume for a moment that at k0 the cosmological constant is tiny,
λ̄k0 ≈ 0, so that hgµν ik0 is an approximately flat metric. In this case the trace in eq. (3.11)

(3.12)

The T -dependence of (3.12) determines the fractal dimensionality of spacetime via (3.5).
In the limits T → ∞ and T → 0 where the random walks probe very large and small
distances, respectively, we obtain the dimensionalities corresponding to the largest and
smallest length scales possible. The limits T → ∞ and T → 0 of P (T ) are determined by
p
the behavior of F (p2 ) ≡ λ̄(k = p2 )/λ̄k0 for p2 → 0 and p2 → ∞, respectively.
For a RG trajectory where the renormalization effects stop below some threshold we

have F (p2 → 0) = 1. In this case (3.12) yields P (T ) ∝ 1/T 2, and we conclude that the
macroscopic spectral dimension is Ds = 4.

In the fixed point regime we have λ̄k ∝ k 2 , and therefore F (p2 ) ∝ p2 . As a result,

the exponent in (3.12) is proportional to p4 now. This implies the T → 0−behavior
P (T ) ∝ 1/T . It corresponds to the spectral dimension Ds = 2.

This result holds for all RG trajectories since only the fixed point properties were
used. In particular it is independent of λ̄k0 on macroscopic scales. In fact, the above
assumption that hgµν ik0 is flat was not necessary for obtaining Ds = 2. This follows from
the fact that even for a curved metric the spectral sum (3.11) can be represented by an
Euler-Mac Laurin series which always implies (3.12) as the leading term for T → 0.
Thus we may conclude that on very small and very large length scales the spectral
dimensions of the QEG spacetimes are
Ds (T → ∞) = 4
Ds (T → 0) = 2

(3.13)

The dimensionality of the fractal realized at sub-Planckian distances is found to be
2 again. It is by no means trivial that Ds coincides with the value of 4 + η. While the

13

replacement of the classical p2 F (p2 ) = p2 by p2 F (p2 ) ∝ p4 is reminiscent of the graviton
propagator argument of Section 2, it is important to emphasize that the value of 4 + η is
entirely determined by the running of Gk , while the spectral dimension was derived from
the k-dependence of the cosmological constant.
In fact, it is remarkable that the equality of 4 + η and Ds is a special feature of
4 classical dimensions. Generalizing for d classical dimensions, the fixed point running
of Newton’s constant becomes Gk ∝ k 2−d with a dimension-dependent exponent, while

e
λ̄k ∝ k 2 continues to have a quadratic k-dependence. As a result, the G(k)
of eq. (2.6)
is proportional to 1/pd in general so that, for any d, the 2-dimensional looking graviton

propagator (2.8) is obtained. (This is equivalent to saying that η = 2 − d, or d + η = 2,
for arbitrary d.)
On the other hand, the impact of the RG effects on the diffusion process is to replace
the operator ∆ by ∆2 , for any d, since the cosmological constant always runs quadratically.
Hence, in the fixed point regime, eq. (3.12) becomes
Z


d
P (T ) ∝ dd p exp −p4 T ∝ T − 4

(3.14)

This T -dependence implies the spectral dimension
Ds (d) =

d
2

(3.15)

This value coincides with d + η if, and only if, d = 4. It is an intriguing speculation
that this could have something to do with the observed macroscopic dimensionality of
spacetime.
Up to this point, to be as concrete as possible, we formulated our argument within
the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. To complete the discussion we show that the exact (untruncated) theory if it has a NGFP implies the dynamical dimensional reduction from 4
to 2 dimensions (in d = 4) in exactly the same way as the truncated one.
P
The complete effective average action has the structure Γk [gµν ] =
n ḡn (k) In [gµν ]

with infinitely many running couplings ḡn (k) and diffeomorphism invariant functionals

In . If ḡn (k) has the canonical dimension dn the corresponding dimensionless couplings are
gn (k) ≡ k −dn ḡn (k) and we have
Γk [gµν ] =

X

gn (k) k dn In [gµν ] =

n

X

gn (k) In [k 2 gµν ]

(3.16)

n

In the second equality we used that In [c2 gµν ] = cdn In [gµν ] for any c > 0 since In has
dimension −dn .
If the theory is asymptotically safe at the exact level, all gn (k) approach constant
values gn∗ for k → ∞:
Γk→∞ [gµν ] =

X

gn∗ In [k 2 gµν ]

(3.17)

n

Obviously this functional depends on k 2 and gµν only via the combination k 2 gµν . Therefore the solutions of the corresponding field equation, hgµν ik , scale proportional to k −2 .

Hence ∆(k) ∝ k 2 in the fixed point regime, and this is exactly the scaling behavior (3.7)
our above derivation of Ds (T → 0) = 2 was based upon.
This completes the demonstration that if a NGFP does exist in the full theory, its
exact spacetimes are fractals with Ds = 2 on sub-Planckian distances.
At this point it is tempting to compare the result (3.13) to the spectral dimensions
of the spacetime which were recently obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the causal
dynamical triangulation model [36]:
Ds (T → ∞) = 4.02 ± 0.1
Ds (T → 0) = 1.80 ± 0.25

(3.18)

These figures, too, suggest that the long-distance and short-distance spectral dimension
should be 4 and 2, respectively.
The dimensional reduction from 4 to 2 dimensions is a highly nontrivial dynamical
phenomenon which seems to occur in both QEG and the discrete triangulation model. We
find it quite remarkable that the discrete and the continuum approach lead to essentially

15

identical conclusions in this respect. We consider this agreement a first hint indicating that
(at least in 4 dimensions) the discrete model and QEG in the average action formulation
might describe the same physics. But clearly much more work is needed in order to
understand how the two approaches are related precisely.

Summary

The general picture of the spacetime structure in QEG which has emerged so far is
as follows. At sub-Planckian distances spacetime is a fractal of dimensionality Ds =
4 + η = 2. It can be thought of as a self-similar hierarchy of superimposed Riemannian
manifolds of any curvature. As one considers larger length scales where the RG running
of the gravitational parameters comes to a halt, the “ripples” in the spacetime gradually
disappear and the structure of a classical 4-dimensional manifold is recovered.
Within the Einstein-Hilbert approximation of QEG there are two natural ways of
defining an effective dimensionality of the fractal spacetime. We can either define it
as 4 + ηN as derived from the running of Newton’s constant, or we use the spectral
dimension implied by the k-dependence of the cosmological constant. We have seen
that both definitions lead to identical results on very large and very small distances.
We also showed that the microscopic dimensionality Ds = 2 is a rather direct and exact
consequence of asymptotic safety which does not rely on any approximation or truncation.
It is therefore not unlikely that the mechanism of a dynamical dimensional reduction
from 4 to 2 dimensions which occurs in QEG is the same phenomenon as the dimensional
reduction observed in the Monte Carlo studies of causal dynamical triangulations.
