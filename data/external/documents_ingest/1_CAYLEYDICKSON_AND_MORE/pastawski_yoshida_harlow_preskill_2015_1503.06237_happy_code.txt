                                          Abstract: We propose a family of exactly solvable toy models for the AdS/CFT
                                          correspondence based on a novel construction of quantum error-correcting codes with a
                                          tensor network structure. Our building block is a special type of tensor with maximal
                                          entanglement along any bipartition, which gives rise to an isometry from the bulk
                                          Hilbert space to the boundary Hilbert space. The entire tensor network is an encoder
                                          for a quantum error-correcting code, where the bulk and boundary degrees of freedom
                                          may be identified as logical and physical degrees of freedom respectively. These models
                                          capture key features of entanglement in the AdS/CFT correspondence; in particular,
                                          the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the negativity of tripartite information are obeyed
                                          exactly in many cases. That bulk logical operators can be represented on multiple
                                          boundary regions mimics the Rindler-wedge reconstruction of boundary operators from
                                          bulk operators, realizing explicitly the quantum error-correcting features of AdS/CFT
                                          recently proposed in [1].

1   Introduction
The AdS/CFT correspondence, an exact duality between quantum gravity on a (d+1)-
dimensional asymptotically-AdS space and a d-dimensional CFT defined on its bound-
ary, has significantly advanced our understanding of quantum gravity, as well as pro-
vided a powerful framework for studying strongly-coupled quantum field theories. One
aspect of this duality is a remarkable relationship between geometry and entanglement.
This notion first appeared in the proposal [2] that two entangled CFT’s have a bulk dual
connecting them through a wormhole, and was later quantified by Ryu and Takayanagi
via their proposal that entanglement entropy in the CFT is computed by the area of
a certain minimal surface in the bulk geometry [3, 4]. This latter proposal, known as
the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula, has led to much further work on sharpening the
connection between geometry and entanglement [5–12]
    In the condensed matter physics community, improved understanding of quantum
entanglement has led to significant progress in the numerical simulation of emergent
phenomena in strongly-interacting systems. A key ingredient of such algorithms is
the use of tensor networks to efficiently represent quantum many-body states [13–
15]. Vidal combined this idea with entanglement renormalization to formulate the
Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) [16, 17], a family of tensor
networks that efficiently approximate wave functions with long-range entanglement
of the type exhibited by ground states of local scale-invariant Hamiltonians [18–20].
The key idea is to represent entanglement at different length scales using tensors in a
hierarchical array.
    In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the emergent radial direction can be regarded
as a renormalization scale [21], and spatial slices have a hyperbolic geometry resem-
bling the exponentially growing tensor networks of MERA. This similarity between
AdS/CFT and MERA was pointed out by Swingle, who argued that some physics of
the AdS/CFT correspondence can be modeled by a MERA-like tensor network where



                                         –1–
quantum entanglement in the boundary theory is regarded as a building block for the
emergent bulk geometry [22, 23].
     Recently it has been argued in [1] that the emergence of bulk locality in AdS/CFT
can be usefully characterized in the language of quantum error-correcting codes. Cer-
tain paradoxical features of the correspondence arise naturally by interpreting bulk
local operators as logical operators on certain subspaces of states in the CFT, whose
entanglement structure protects these operators from boundary erasures. Moreover,
inspired by [22, 23], it was suggested that there should be tensor network models that
concretely implement these ideas.
     In this paper, we propose such a family of exactly solvable toy models of the
bulk/boundary correspondence based on a novel tensor-network construction of quan-
tum error-correcting codes. Other authors have recently used holographic ideas [24, 25]
and related tensor network constructions [26, 27] to build quantum codes with inter-
esting properties or toy models of the bulk/boundary correspondence [28], but our
approach differs from previous work by combining the following properties, all of which
are desirable for a model of AdS/CFT:

   • Exactly solvable: Many of the properties of our models can be shown explic-
     itly. In particular, an exact prescription for mapping bulk operators to boundary
     operators can be obtained, and we can give examples where the Ryu-Takayanagi
     formula holds exactly for all connected boundary regions.

   • QECC: Our models are quantum error-correcting codes, where the bulk/boundary
     legs of the tensor network correspond to input/outputs of an encoding quantum
     circuit. In this sense they realize explicitly the proposal of [1].

   • Bulk uniformity: The tensor network is supported on a uniform tiling of a
     hyperbolic space, known as a hyperbolic tessellation. If the tiling is extended to
     an infinite system, the tensor network has no inherent directionality and all the
     locations in the bulk can be treated on an equal footing (see Fig. 4b).

     The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce a class of
tensors called perfect tensors, which are associated with pure quantum states of many
spins such that the entanglement is maximal across any partition of the spins into two
sets of equal size. In section 3, we construct holographic states and codes by building
networks of perfect tensors. These codes have properties reminiscent of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, elucidated in the rest of the paper, where the code’s logical/physical
degrees of freedom are interpreted as the bulk/boundary degrees of freedom of a CFT
with a gravitational dual.



                                          –2–
     In section 4, we study the entanglement structure of holographic states, showing
that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula is exactly satisfied for any connected boundary region,
developing a graphical representation of multipartite entanglement, and confirming the
negativity of tripartite information [9]. In section 5, we investigate the dictionary
relating bulk and boundary observables, define a lattice version of the causal wedge,
and explain how bulk local operators in the causal wedge can be reconstructed on
the boundary; we also define a lattice version of the entanglement wedge, and offer
evidence supporting the entanglement wedge hypothesis proposed in [40–42], see also
[67]. We briefly discuss how to describe black holes using holographic codes in section 6.
Section 7 contains our conclusions, and many details appear in the appendices.


2   Isometries and perfect tensors
In this section we review some tools which will be used in our constructions of holo-
graphic states and codes. We begin with a standard definition:

Definition 1. Say HA and HB are two Hilbert spaces, not necessarily of the same
dimensionality. An isometry from HA to HB is a linear map T : HA 7→ HB with the
property that it preserves the inner product.

     If HA and HB have finite dimensionality, as we will assume throughout this paper,
then it immediately follows that such a T can exist only if their dimensionalities dim(A)
and dim(B) obey dim(A) ≤ dim(B). In the special case where dim(A) = dim(B), T
is just a unitary transformation. Clearly the composition of two isometries is also an
isometry.
     If T : HA 7→ HB is an isometry, then T † T is the identity on HA and T T † is a
projector mapping HB to the range of T . We may represent the map T as a two-index
tensor acting as                             X
                                  T : |ai 7→    |biTba ,                             (2.1)
                                              b

where {|ai} denotes a complete orthonormal basis for HA and {|bi} for HB . Then T
is an isometry if and only if    X †
                                    Ta0 b Tba = δa0 a .                      (2.2)
                                     b

We represent this graphically in figure 1, following the convention that operators are
ordered from left to right, so that in the figure T † is applied after T . We will call a
tensor obeying (2.2) an isometric tensor.




                                          –3–
      Figure 1. Diagrammatic tensor notation, here showing that T is an isometry.


     Isometric tensors have the property that any operator O acting on its “incoming”
leg, can be replaced by an equal norm operator O0 acting on its “outgoing” leg, because

                          T O = T OT † T = (T OT † )T ≡ O0 T ;                      (2.3)

we illustrate this property in figure 2. This operation is essential for what follows,




                Figure 2. Operator pushing through an isometric tensor.

and we will often describe it as “pushing an operator through a tensor”. It is also
easy to check a useful converse of operator pushing: If the two-index tensor T has the
property that any unitary transformation U contracted with its incoming index can
be replaced by a corresponding unitary transformation U 0 contracted with its outgoing
index (i.e., T U = U 0 T ), then T obeys (2.2) up to a scalar factor, and therefore must
be proportional to an isometric tensor.




Figure 3. If HA = HA2 ⊗ HA1 , then we can move one of the factors to the output while
preserving the isometric structure.

    Another important property of isometric tensors is that if the input Hilbert space
factorizes, we may reinterpret an input factor as an output factor while preserving
(2.2), up to an overall rescaling. That is, if T : HA2 ⊗ HA1 7→ HB is an isometric map,




                                         –4–
acting on a basis according to
                                                       X
                                    T : |a2 a1 i 7→             |biTba2 a1 ,         (2.4)
                                                            b


then T̃ : HA1 7→ HB ⊗ HA2 acting as
                                                      X
                                    T̃ : |a1 i 7→           |ba2 iTba2 a1            (2.5)
                                                      ba2


obeys T̃ † T̃ = dim(A2 )IA1 . We illustrate this property in figure 3.
     In this paper we will be interested in a special class of isometric tensors, which we
will call perfect tensors. To formulate the concept of a perfect tensor, first note that
we may divide the m indices of a tensor Ta1 a2 ...am into a set A and a complementary
set Ac . We use |A| to denote the cardinality of the set A; hence |A| + |Ac | = m. Then
T may be regarded as a linear map from the span of the indices in A to the span of
the indices in Ac . We will usually assume that each index ranges over v values, and
we will use A to denote both the set of |A| indices and the corresponding vector space
with dimension v |A| ; thus we say T maps A to Ac .

Definition 2. A 2n-index tensor Ta1 a2 ...a2n is a perfect tensor if, for any bipartition
of its indices into a set A and complementary set Ac with |A| ≤ |Ac |, T is proportional
to an isometric tensor from A to Ac .

    It is not obvious that nontrivial perfect tensors exist, but they do! Note that for
T to be perfect it suffices for T to be a unitary transformation when |A| = |Ac | = n;
in that case the property illustrated in figure 3 ensures that T is proportional to an
isometric tensor for |A| < n. In Appendix A we describe perfect tensors explicitly for
the case n = 3, v = 2 and for the case n = 2, v = 3; other cases with larger n and v
are also discussed there. To keep our discussion concrete, we will focus especially on
the six-index tensor for qubits (v = 2)1 , but much of what we say applies to arbitrary
2n-index perfect tensors.
    Perfect tensors are related to other notable ideas in quantum information theory.
In general, a tensor T with m indices, each ranging over v values, describes a pure
quantum state |ψi of m v-dimensional spins, where, up to a normalization factor,
                                   X
                          |ψi =           Ta1 a2 ...am |a1 a2 . . . am i.         (2.6)
                                     a1 ,a2 ,...,am

      This can be obtained from the encoding map of the 5-qubit code.




                                                      –5–
A perfect tensor describes a pure state of 2n spins with a special property — any set
of n spins is maximally entangled with the complementary set of n spins. Such states
have been called absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states [29, 30]. Conversely any
AM E state defines a perfect tensor. Regarded as a linear map from one spin to 2n − 1
spins, a perfect tensor is the isometric encoding map of a quantum error-correcting code
which encodes a single logical spin in a block of 2n − 1 physical spins, where the logical
spin is protected against the erasure of any n−1 physical spins. Because n is more than
half of all the physical spins, this is the best possible protection against erasure errors
compatible with the no-cloning principle. In coding terminology this code has distance
n and is denoted [[m, k, d]]v = [[2n − 1, 1, n]]v , where m is the number of physical spins
in the code block, k is the number of protected logical spins, and d is the code distance.
This code is also the basis for a quantum-secret-sharing scheme called a ((n, 2n − 1))
threshold scheme [31]; code states have the property that a party holding any n − 1
spins has no information about the logical spin, while a party holding any n spins has
complete information about the logical spin (because erasure of the remaining n − 1
spins is correctable).


3       Construction of holographic quantum states and codes
We have seen how tensors can be interpreted as quantum states or quantum codes. In
this section we construct tensor networks in which the fundamental building blocks are
perfect tensors. Our tensor networks describe states which we call holographic states,
and codes which we call holographic codes.
     We shall focus on examples based on tilings of two-dimensional hyperbolic space,
which are specific realizations of uniform hyperbolic tilings known as hyperbolic tes-
sellations. These tilings have desirable symmetries for constructing a toy model of
the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular they are discretely scale-invariant, and
there exist graph isomorphisms that bring any point in the graph to the center while
preserving the local structure of the tiling.2 The machinery we develop may also be
straightforwardly applied to non-uniform and higher-dimensional graphs.
     Let’s first consider a uniform tiling of a two-dimensional hyperbolic space by
hexagons, with four hexagons adjacent at each vertex, as depicted in Fig 4a. A perfect
tensor with six legs is placed at each hexagon, and legs of perfect tensors are contracted
with neighboring tensors at shared edges of the hexagons. We associate physical spins
with the uncontracted open tensor legs on the boundary of the hyperbolic tiling; the
    2
    Such transformations can be directly visualized using Kaleidotile software [32], which is freely
available and has been of great aid in developing geometric intuition and producing figures of uniform
hyperbolic tilings in this paper.

Figure 4. White dots represent physical legs on the boundary. Red dots represent logical
input legs associated to each perfect tensor.


tensor network corresponds to a pure state of these boundary spins, which we call a
holographic state. Note that perfect tensors are not necessarily symmetric under all the
possible permutations of tensor legs, and thus we specify some particular ordering of
tensor legs in the construction.
    We may similarly attach a state interpretation to more general networks con-
structed by contracting perfect tensors:

Definition 3. Consider a tensor network composed of perfect tensors which cover some
geometric manifold with boundary, where all the interior tensor legs are contracted. A
holographic state is a state interpretation of such a tensor network, where physical
degrees of freedom are associated with all uncontracted legs at the boundary of the
manifold.

    We now provide an example of a holographic quantum code. As in a holographic
state, we consider a uniform tiling of the hyperbolic disc, this time by pentagons, with
four pentagons adjacent at each vertex. A perfect tensor with six legs is placed at each
pentagon, so that each tensor has one additional uncontracted open leg. This additional
tensor leg is interpreted as a bulk index or logical input for the tensor network (see
Fig. 4b). The entire system can be viewed as a big tensor with logical legs in the bulk
and physical legs on the boundary. We then have the following theorem:

Theorem 1. The pentagon-tiling tensor network is an isometric tensor from the bulk
to the boundary. We call it the holographic pentagon code.



                                         –7–
     We can prove this theorem by noting that if we order the tensors into layers la-
beled by increasing graph distance from the center, each tensor has at most two legs
contracted with the tensors at the previous layer (this property is a consequence of
the “negative curvature” of the graph). Therefore, even if we regard the pentagon’s
bulk logical index as an input leg, the total number of input legs is at most three, and
we may therefore regard each tensor as an isometry from input legs to output legs.
Applying the perfect tensors layer by layer, and recalling that the product of isometries
is an isometry, we obtain an isometry mapping all the logical indices in the bulk to the
physical indices on the boundary.
     We can view this isometry as the encoding transformation of a quantum error-
correcting code, which we call a holographic code. The number of logical v-dimensional
spins is the number Nbulk of pentagons in the tiling, and the number of physical v-
dimensional spins in the code block is the number Nboundary of uncontracted boundary
indices in the tensor network. We show in Appendix C that the rate of the code,
meaning the ratio of the number of logical spins to the number of physical spins,

in the limit of a large number of layers.
     This pentagon code was constructed by successively adding layers of tensors start-
ing from the center and stopping after repeating this procedure a certain number of
times (two layers in figure 4b). Alternatively, we may fill the bulk using a non-uniform
cutoff, so that the graph distance between the “center” and the boundary varies from
one portion of the boundary to another (as occurs in figure 4a). By exerting this free-
dom, we may change the corresponding value 3.1 for the rate of the code and even
slightly increase it. By varying the choice of perfect tensor and the shape of the cutoff,
a large family of holographic codes can be constructed:
Definition 4. Consider a tensor network composed of perfect tensors which cover
some geometric manifold with boundaries. The tensor network is called a holographic
code if it gives rise to an isometric map from uncontracted bulk legs to uncontracted
boundary legs.
    Tensor networks with open legs in the bulk were first proposed by Vidal [17]. More
recently, Qi [28] constructed a tensor-tree model with an exact unitary mapping between
the bulk and the boundary. The most important difference between their models and
ours is that their states are not protected against erasure of physical spins because the
code rate is asymptotically unity. In addition our models are more symmetric; since



                                          –8–
perfect tensors can be interpreted as isometries along any direction, our models have no
preferred direction in the bulk and all bulk sites are treated equally. In particular, the
pentagon code has the nice feature that, because the 6-leg perfect tensor we construct
in appendix A is symmetric under cyclic permutations of five of the legs, which we take
to be the contracted legs, the symmetry of the network is just the full symmetry of the
graph.


4     Entanglement structure of holographic states
In this section we explore to what extent holographic states reproduce key properties
of the AdS/CFT correspondence, such as the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entropy of a
boundary region [3] and the negativity of tripartite information [9].

4.1   Ryu-Takayanagi formula
The Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula says that for a CFT whose gravitational dual is well-
approximated by Einstein gravity at low energies, in any static state with a geometric
bulk description the entropy SA of a boundary subregion A at fixed time obeys

                                            Area(γA )
                                     SA =             ;                               (4.1)
                                              4G
here G is Newton’s constant and γA is the minimal-area codimension-two bulk surface
whose boundary matches the boundary ∂A of A. In our examples the bulk theory is
2 + 1 dimensional, so γA will be a spacelike bulk geodesic whose “area” is just defined
as its length.
     In our discrete setting, we will define γA as a certain cut through the tensor network
which partitions it into two disjoint sets of perfect tensors. Associated with a cut c is
a decomposition of the tensor network as a contraction of two tensors P and Q, where
the contracted legs lie along the cut; the number of contracted legs is called the length
of c, denoted |c|. If A is a set of boundary legs and Ac is the complementary set of
boundary legs, then we say that the boundary of the cut c matches the boundary of A
if the uncontracted legs of P are the legs of A, and the uncontracted legs of Q are the
legs of Ac . The minimal bulk geodesic bounded by A, γA , is then defined as the cut c
of shortest length whose boundary matches the boundary of A. We use P to denote,
not just the tensor associated with one side of the cut, but also the set of bulk lattice
sites corresponding to the perfect tensors which are contracted to construct P ; likewise
for Q. We note that P or Q might have more than one connected component, and so
might γA when regarded as a path in the dual graph.




                                            –9–
    A standard argument for tensor network representations of quantum states shows
that |γA | provides an upper bound on SA . If P and Q are the tensors associated with a
cut c whose boundary matches the boundary of A, then the holographic state |ψi may
be expressed (up to normalization) as
                              X                X
                        |ψi =    |abiPai Qbi ≡    |Pi iA ⊗ |Qi iAc .              (4.2)
                              a,b,i                       i


Here a and b run over complete bases for A and Ac respectively, and i runs over all
possible values of the indices contracted along c; the vectors {|Pi i} in HA and the
vectors {|Qi i} in HAc are not necessarily orthogonal or normalized. (See figure 5.)
Tracing out Ac we obtain (up to normalization) the density operator on A:
                                                                          c
                                                                      i                       b

Figure 5. A cut through a holographic tensor network by a curve c bounded by ∂A. Bound-
ary indices a and b are uncontracted in A and its complement Ac respectively; tensors P and
Q are contracted by summing over the index i which is cut by c.

                                ρA =             hQi0 |Qi i|Pi ihPi0 |.                           (4.3)
                                          i,i0


Evidently the rank of ρA is at most the number of terms in the sum over i, namely
v |c| . The density operator of a given rank with maximal Von Neumann entropy is
proportional to the identity on its support, and has entropy equal to log of the rank.
We obtain the best bound by choosing the cut c = γA with the shortest length:

                                      SA ≤ |γA | · log v.                                         (4.4)

In most of what follows, we will define entropy by taking logs with base v, and so



                                                 – 10 –
suppress the log v factor.
     If the tensors P and Q are actually isometries from i to a and b respectively, then
{|Pi i} and {|Qi i} are sets of orthonormal vectors; in that case (4.4) is saturated and a
discrete analogue of the RT formula holds exactly. Under what conditions will P and
Q be isometries? We can prove the following theorem:

Theorem 2. Suppose that we have a holographic state associated to a simply-connected
planar tensor network of perfect tensors, whose graph has “non-positive curvature”.3
Then for any connected region A on the boundary, we have SA = |γA |; in other words,
the lattice RT formula holds.

     The strategy of the proof is to show that P and Q can in fact be interpreted as
unitary transformations, from the cut together with some subregion of A or Ac to the
rest of A or Ac respectively. We can then use the identity depicted in figure 3 to re-
interpret these transformations as isometries from the cut to A and from the cut to Ac
respectively; the RT formula follows. The key to the argument, explained in appendix
B, is using a strengthened version of the max-flow min-cut theorem (which is standard
in graph theory [33]) to establish that the tensor network representations of P and Q
can be interpreted as unitary quantum circuits.

4.2    Bipartite entanglement of disconnected regions
Unfortunately the proof of Theorem 2 does not directly generalize to a disconnected
region A, nor even to connected regions for states, such as our holographic code states,
where not all perfect tensor indices are contracted in the bulk. We do not consider
this to be a serious problem for our models. However, we still find it worthwhile to
introduce some machinery that allows us to quantify this presumption somewhat.
     The first technique we will introduce is an algorithmic procedure for constructing,
given a boundary region A, a bulk curve γA? bounded by ∂A such that the corresponding
tensor P is guaranteed to be an isometry. For a holographic state the isometry P maps
γA? to A, and for a holographic code P maps γA? and all incoming bulk indices of P to
A. Furthermore, γA? is a local minimum of the length, in the sense that no single tensor
can be added to or removed from P which reduces the length of the cut.
     The algorithm makes essential use of the properties of perfect tensors and is quite
simple. We consider a sequence of cuts {cα } each bounded by ∂A, and a corresponding
sequence of isometries {Pα }, such that each cut in the sequence is obtained from the
previous one by a local move on the bulk lattice. The sequence begins with the trivial
   3
    The scalar curvature of a graph is somewhat tricky to define in general; the condition we really
need here is that the distance functional from one point on the dual network to another does not have
interior local maxima.




                                              – 11 –
cut, A itself; in each step we identify one perfect tensor which has at least half of its
legs contracted with Pα and construct Pα+1 by adding this perfect tensor to Pα . Thus
Pα+1 is obtained by composing Pα with an isometry defined by a perfect tensor, and
therefore Pα+1 is an isometry if Pα is. The procedure halts when the cut reaches γA? and
no further local moves are possible. Though many different sequences of local moves
are allowed, γA? is well defined; tensors eligible for inclusion in Pα+1 remain so as other
tensors are included, so the output of the algorithm does not depend on the order of
inclusion. Following standard computer science terminology, we call this procedure the
greedy algorithm and call γA? the greedy geodesic. A step of the greedy algorithm is
illustrated in figure 6.




Figure 6. A step in the greedy algorithm. The upper node has at least three legs contracted
with the region P , which we have shaded red, so we include it into P .




Figure 7. Three examples where the greedy algorithm fails to find the matching minimal
geodesics from complementary regions. The first example involves disconnected regions in
the holographic state. The second example involves a positive curvature obstruction at the
center of the tiling which blocks the greedy geodesic from reaching the global minimal surface.
The third example involves a connected region for the holographic code. In both the first and
the third figure the greedy algorithm finds minimal geodesics from both sides but they do
not match. In both cases, it is possible for the entropy to be slightly smaller than the length
of the geodesic. This depends on tensors which were not absorbed by either of the greedy
geodesics which we call the bipartite residual regions.

    When the assumptions of Theorem 2 are satisfied, the argument in appendix B
ensures that the greedy algorithm will find a true minimal geodesic γA . If there is



                                            – 12 –
more than one minimal geodesic, as is sometimes the case, then the greedy algorithm
might continue past a minimal geodesic and proceed through minimal geodesics of
equal length. In that case, the tensors in between the successive geodesics define a
unitary transformation from one cut to the other. If A has more than one connected
component, if there is positive curvature, or if there are uncontracted bulk indices as
for a holographic code, the greedy algorithm does not necessarily succeed in finding
matching minimal geodesics, as we illustrate in figure 7.
      In cases where the greedy algorithm fails to find a minimal geodesic, we can still
use it to prove an interesting lower bound on the entropy SA . Suppose that γA? and
γA? c are two greedy geodesics, produced by applying the greedy algorithm to A and its
complement Ac respectively, where P and Q are the corresponding tensors. Further-
more, suppose that γA? ∩ γA? c is non-empty, in the sense that some links are cut by both
geodesics. We can represent that state as4
                         X                           X
                  |ψi =        |abiPa,ij Qb,ik Sjk ≡   Sjk |Pij iA ⊗ |Qik iAc .      (4.5)
                          a,b,i,j,k                             i,j,k


Here i denotes the index shared between γA? and γA? c , j is the index unique to γA? , k is
the index unique to γA? c , and S denotes the tensor that sits “in between” γA? and γA? c .
We call the set of lattice sites in S the bipartite residual region (where the modifier
“bipartite” draws a distinction with the multipartite residual region to be discussed
in section 4.3.) Because P and Q are isometries, both {|Pij i} and {|Qik i} are sets of
orthonormal vectors. Therefore, the marginal density operator for A is
                                     X
                               ρA =      Sjk Sj∗0 k |Pij ihPij 0 |.                  (4.6)
                                          i,j,j 0 ,k


This density operator has support on the subspace of A spanned by {|Pij i}, which has
              ?
dimension v |γA | , and this subspace has a decomposition into subsystems A1 ⊗ A2 such
that the basis element |Pij i may be expressed as |iiA1 ⊗ |jiA2 , where {|ii} and {|ji}
are orthonormal bases for A1 and A2 respectively. We may then write
                                          !                             !
                               X               X

    4
      For holographic codes with dangling bulk legs, we assume for now that a product state is fed into
all bulk legs. If the input bulk state were entangled instead, there would be additional contributions
to the boundary entanglement which we are not including. This same proviso also applies to the
discussion in the following subsection.

and from the additivity of the entropy, using dim(A1 ) = v |A1 | = v |γA ∩γAc | , we obtain
the following theorem.
Theorem 3. For a holographic state or code, if A is a (not necessarily connected)
boundary region and Ac is its complement, then the entropy of A satisfies

                                      SA ≥ |γA? ∩ γA? c |,                             (4.8)

where γA? is the greedy geodesic obtained by applying the greedy algorithm to A and γA? c
is the greedy geodesic obtained by applying the greedy algorithm to Ac .
     We see from Theorem 3 that violations of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula are closely
related to the size of the bipartite residual region. In particular, if there is no bipartite
residual region then SA = |γA? |; the upper bound (4.4) and the lower bound (4.8)
together imply that γA? is in fact a minimal geodesic, and RT holds. We will argue in
section 4.3 that the bipartite residual region has size O(1) when the regions A and Ac
on the boundary have O(1) connected components. In this sense, the corrections to
the RT formula are typically small.

4.3   A map of multipartite entanglement
So far we have emphasized the bipartite entanglement between a boundary region A and
its complement Ac in a holographic state or code. But we may also divide the boundary
into three or more regions and investigate the structure of the entanglement among
these regions. The entanglement structure can be elucidated via an entanglement
“distillation” procedure which we will now describe.
     To explain this procedure we begin by revisiting the case of bipartite entanglement.
We have seen that if the conditions of Theorem 2 are satisfied, then a holographic
                                                                                     ?
state can be expressed in the form (4.2), where a subsystem of A of dimension v |γA | is
maximally entangled with a corresponding subsystem of Ac . This entanglement shared
between two systems is generally diluted, since each party may contain many more
than SA spins. The entanglement would be more useful in a more concentrated form.
     The procedure for transforming dilute entanglement into concentrated entangle-
ment, called entanglement distillation, is particularly simple for a bipartite pure state
like |ψi in (4.2). We choose |γA? | specified spins in A (the subsystem A1 of A) and we
choose |γA? | spins in Ac (the subsystem Ac1 of Ac ). Then we apply a unitary transfor-
mation UA acting on A that transforms the basis states {|Pi iA } to the standard basis
states of A1 , and a unitary transformation UAc acting on Ac that transforms the basis
states {|Qi iAc } to the standard basis states of Ac1 , thus obtaining the state

is a maximally entangled EPR pair of two spins.
     There is a method for constructing the unitary transformations UA and UAc ex-
plicitly, which has a pleasing geometrical interpretation. The method uses the greedy
algorithm for constructing γA? , but where now each local move, in which the cut through
the tensor network advances into the bulk by moving past one additional tensor, is ac-
companied by a local unitary transformation that decouples spins from the network.
This local unitary transformation is depicted in figure 8, where entanglement distilla-
tion is performed on a pair of contracted six-leg tensors.

Figure 8.       The correspondence between local moves and distillation of EPR pairs. (a)
Distillation of two EPR pairs. (b) The corresponding local moves. Before the first move, the
tensor on the left has four legs crossed by the cut. Because the tensor is perfect, its remaining
two legs are maximally entangled with a subsystem of these four. The first local unitary
transformation acts on the four spins below the cut, transforming the basis to decouple the
second and third spin, while the first and fourth spins remain contracted across the cut; in
the corresponding local move, the cut advances upward past the tensor on the left. After
the first move, the tensor on the right has five legs crossed by the cut. The second unitary
transformation changes the basis of these five spins, decoupling the first four, while the fifth
remains contracted across the cut; now the corresponding local move advances the cut upward
past the tensor on the right. The product of the two local unitaries has distilled two EPR
pairs which cross the cut, while decoupling six spins below the cut.

    Since each local move of the greedy algorithm moves the cut past a tensor which




                                              – 15 –
initially has at least three legs crossed by the cut, the legs above the cut are always
maximally entangled with the legs below, and the corresponding local unitary trans-
formation exists. For purposes of visualization, we may imagine that the spins which
remain contracted across the cut advance further into the bulk in each step, remaining
adjacent to the cut, while the spins which decouple are left behind. When the greedy
algorithm applied to A terminates, then, all the decoupled spins of A are distributed
throughout the bulk region in between the greedy geodesic and the boundary, while
|γA? | spins of A, lined up along the greedy geodesic, are contracted with tensors on
the other side of the greedy geodesic. If we also apply the greedy algorithm to Ac ,
then under the conditions of Theorem 2, the algorithm terminates at the same greedy
geodesic. Acting together, then, the unitary transformations associated with the two
greedy algorithms have decoupled all the boundary spins, except for |γA? | EPR pairs,
one for each of the legs crossed by the greedy geodesic, thus executing the entanglement
distillation protocol.
      Run backwards, the sequence of local unitary transformations associated with the
greedy algorithm constitutes a holographic quantum circuit, which prepares the bound-
ary state. The input to this circuit is |γA? | EPR pairs, plus a suitable number of addi-
tional spins in a product state, distributed throughout the bulk. The circuit builds the
state step by step, gradually incorporating the bulk spins as the cut advances outward
from the greedy geodesic toward the boundary. The input state, envisioned as a set
of EPR pairs lined up along γA? , provides a map of entanglement, a picture character-
izing the structure of the entanglement between A and Ac . (See figure 9.) The initial
EPR pairs along the greedy geodesic which are deep inside the bulk encode long-range
entanglement between A and Ac , while the EPR pairs closer to the boundary encode
shorter-range entanglement.

ment, whether or not the conditions of Theorem 2 are satisfied. Suppose, for example,
that we divide the boundary into four regions A, B, C, D, each of which is connected, as
in figure 10. We may apply the greedy algorithm separately to each of the four regions,
obtaining greedy geodesics γA? , γB? , γC? , γD
                                              ?

           ?
geodesic γA is called the causal wedge of A, denoted C[A]. (The significance of the
causal wedge in holographic codes will be discussed at length in section 5.) As figure
10 indicates, the union C[A] ∪ C[B] ∪ C[C] ∪ C[D] of the four causal wedges need not
cover the entire bulk lattice — there may be a multipartite residual region in the bulk,
which the greedy algorithm fails to reach when applied to the boundary regions one at
a time. As we explain below, the size of the multipartite residual region is expected to
be O(1), independent of the total system size.

Figure 10. The “map of entanglement” and multipartite residual regions in a holographic
state. For |A||C|  |B||D| it is possible for the residual region to pinch off so much that EPR
pairs can be directly distilled between A and C. In other words, due to the discretization
of the lattice, the causal wedges C[A] and C[C] may be adjacent in the bulk. In this case
the residual region may be composed of two disconnected components, RB and RC which
can contribute tripartite correlations. A similar analysis holds for |A||C|  |B||D|. For
|A||C| ≈ |B||D|, a single connected residual region R contiguous to the four causal wedges is
expected and may contribute four-party correlations.

    Multipartite residual regions in the bulk can indicate multipartite entanglement
among the four regions on the boundary. As discussed above for the case of bipartite
entanglement, suppose we decouple spins in each of A, B, C, D by performing suitable
local unitary transformations associated with each step of the greedy algorithm. Where
the greedy geodesics of adjacent regions meet, EPR pairs are distilled, in keeping with




                                            – 17 –
our observation in section 4.2 that the bipartite entanglement of two boundary regions
is no less than the length of the greedy geodesic shared by the two regions. The tensors
trapped inside a multipartite residual region however, do not necessarily have a decom-
position into EPR pairs. Instead it describes a state with multipartite entanglement,
which cannot be expressed as a product of states with only bipartite entanglement.
     Just as for a partition of the boundary into connected regions A and Ac , we can
reverse the order in which tensors are incorporated by the greedy algorithm to obtain
a holographic quantum circuit of isometries which prepares the boundary state. When
we partition the boundary into four connected regions, however, the input to the cir-
cuit includes more than just EPR pairs distributed along shared greedy geodesics and
decoupled spins in the bulk; additional multipartite states associated with each con-
nected component of the bulk multipartite residual region are also part of the input.
The circuit factorizes into a product UA ⊗ UB ⊗ UC ⊗ UD , with each of the four unitary
transformations acting within its own causal wedge to build the corresponding con-
nected component of the boundary. Again, the greedy geodesics encode a “map” of the
entanglement among A, B, C, D, now including a description of multipartite entangle-
ment among all the regions as well as bipartite entanglement among pairs of regions.
Two such maps are shown in figure 10; in these cases a single six-leg tensor is trapped in
each connected component of the bulk multipartite residual region, though in general
a more complex tensor network could be trapped inside as indicated in figure 7.
     We may also argue that if the bulk has constant negative curvature, then for any
partition of the boundary into O(1) connected components, the multipartite residual
region is always O(1) in size. This statement is true for the Riemannian geometry of the
hyperbolic plane, but is merely heuristic because it disregards subtleties arising from
the discrete lattice structure of the bulk. For a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold,
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the residual region R states that
                             Z           Z
                                K dA +       kg ds = 2πχ(R).                        (4.11)
                             R           ∂R

here K is the Gaussian curvature, kg is the geodesic curvature, and χ(R) is the Euler
characteristic of the residual region, which is χ = 1 when R has the topology of a
disk. If R is the interior of an m-gon whose sides are geodesics, (4.11) says that the
integral of K over R is the deviation of the sum of interior angles of the m-gon from
the corresponding sum for an m-gon in flat space; the latter sum is (m − 2)π because
the m-gon can be covered by m − 2 triangles. For the AdS space, the interior angles
approach zero as the space becomes large compared to its curvature radius; therefore
assuming uniform negative curvature K = −1/α2 (where α is the AdS radius), we




                                         – 18 –
conclude that the volume of the residual region is

                                  V (R) = π(m − 2)α2 .                             (4.12)

In our tensor networks α is of order the length of a link; therefore V (R) is O(1) in
lattice units if m is O(1), which establishes our claim.
     Likewise, the bipartite residual region arising from a partition of the boundary into
two regions A and Ac , discussed in section 4.2, has size O(1) if A and Ac both have
O(1) connected components. Indeed, the bipartite residual region is contained in the
multipartite residual region found by applying the greedy algorithm separately to each
connected component of A and of Ac .

4.4   Negative tripartite information
A useful characterization of multipartite entanglement is the tripartite information,
defined as

              I3 (A, B, C) ≡ SA + SB + SC − SAB − SAC − SBC + SABC .               (4.13)

For a general (mixed) tripartite quantum state, I3 can take any real value. It is zero,
though, for any tripartite pure state of ABC, since in that case SABC = 0 and e.g.
regions A and BC, being complementary, have the same entropy and therefore make
cancelling contributions to I3 . Nor is there a contribution to I3 from EPR pairs shared
between a pair of the three regions (because e.g. a pair shared by AB yields positive
contributions to SA and SB which are cancelled by negative contributions from −SAC
and −SBC ) or from entanglement shared between one of the three regions and a fourth
disjoint region. Thus, for a holographic state and for any partition of the boundary
into four regions A, B, C, D, nonzero contributions to I3 (A, B, C) can arise only from
the distilled multipartite states trapped in residual regions.
     In the holographic setting, it has been shown that I3 ≤ 0 follows from the RT
formula [9]. For holographic states and codes, the non-positivity of I3 is not ensured in
general, because of the potential (small) violations of the RT formula. In some special
cases, though, RT holds exactly, and the non-positivity of I3 then follows. For example,
suppose that we partition the boundary into four connected regions A, B, C, D, and that
each connected component of the multipartite residual region traps just one perfect
tensor. In that case there is no bipartite residual region, so Theorem 3 implies that RT
is exact and therefore I3 ≤ 0. To see that there is no bipartite residual region in this
case, consider the bipartite partition of the boundary into the two disconnected regions
AC and BD, and consider an isolated 2n-index perfect tensor surrounded by three or




                                         – 19 –
all four of the greedy geodesics γA? , γB? , γC? , γD
                                                    ?
                                                      . This tensor must have at least n legs
                  ?     ?     ?    ?
crossing either γA ∪ γC or γB ∪ γD . Therefore, when we apply the greedy algorithm to
the boundary regions AC and BD, one cut or the other will advance past this isolated
tensor, excluding it from the bipartite residual region.
     Under suitable conditions we can actually prove a stronger result — that I3 is
strictly negative. Let us say that a connected component of the multipartite residual
region is three sided if surrounded by three of the four greedy geodesics, and four
sided if surrounded by all four greedy geodesics. Three-sided components make no
contribution to I3 ; if the three surrounding greedy geodesics are those of X, Y, Z, the
symmetry of I3 implies I3 (A, B, C) = I3 (X, Y, Z), which vanishes for any pure state of
XY Z. But an isolated 2n-index perfect tensor which crosses all four greedy geodesics
makes a negative contribution to I3 :
Theorem 4. Suppose the 2n indices of a perfect tensor state are partitioned into four
disjoint nonempty sets A, B, C, D such that 0 < |A|, |B|, |C|, |D| < n. Then the tripar-
tite information I3 is strictly negative: I3 (A, B, C) < 0.
Proof. First we notice that for a four-part pure state ABCD, the tripartite information
I(A, B, C) is actually completely symmetric under permutations of the four subsystems,
which we can see by using the property that complementary regions have the same
entropy in a pure state:

   I3 (A, B, C) = SA + SB + SC − SAB − SBC − SAC + SABC                (4.14)
                                      1
                = SA + SB + SC + SD − (SAB + SCD + SBC + SAD + SAC + SBD ).
                                      2
                                                                       (4.15)

We may therefore assume without loss of generality that |A| ≤ |B| ≤ |C| ≤ |D| which
implies |AB| ≤ |CD| and |AC| ≤ |BD|. Now we use the defining property of 2n-
index perfect tensors, that a set of n or fewer indices is maximally entangled with
its complement, which implies SX = min(|X|, 2n − |X|), with entropy expressed in
units of log v. Therefore SA = |A|, SB = |B|, SC = |C|, SD = |D|, and furthermore
SAB = |AB| and SAC = |AC|. Now we distinguish two cases. If |AD| ≤ |BC|, then
SBC = SAD = |AD| and we have

    I3 (A, B, C) = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| − |AB| − |AC| − |AD| = −2|A| < 0.            (4.16)

If on the other hand |BC| ≤ |AD|, then SAD = SBC = |BC| and we have

  I3 (A, B, C) = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| − |AB| − |AC| − |BC| = 2|D| − 2n < 0, (4.17)




                                           – 20 –
where to obtain the second equality we use |AB| + |AC| + |BC| = 2(|A| + |B| + |C|) =
2(2n − |D|). This completes the proof.

     For a holographic state with boundary partitioned into sets A, B, C, D, the condi-
tions of Theorem 4 are satisfied by an isolated perfect tensor trapped inside a four-sided
component of the multipartite residual region; fewer than n of the tensor’s legs cross
any greedy geodesic, because otherwise the greedy algorithm would have moved the
cut forward past this perfect tensor, which therefore would not be in the multipartite
residual region. Furthermore, since entropy is additive for a product state, I3 is also
strictly negative for any product of perfect tensor states shared by A, B, C, D, provided
that at least one factor has support on all four sets. Since only the four-sided regions
contribute to I3 , we conclude that I3 is strictly negative if the multipartite residual
region contains at least one four-sided connected component, and if each four-sided
connected component contains only one perfect tensor.


5     Quantum error correction in holographic codes
In this section we study the error correction properties of our holographic codes in more
detail. The idea that a CFT with a gravity dual must have error correcting properties
was recently proposed in [1], and in this section we will see that our holographic codes
illustrate many aspects of the proposal of [1] quite explicitly.

5.1   AdS-Rindler reconstruction as error correction
We begin by briefly recalling the main point emphasized in [1], which is that in
AdS/CFT a bulk local observable can be realized by many different operators in the
CFT. In fact, if x is any point in the bulk, and Y is any point on the boundary, the
AdS/CFT dictionary can be chosen so that it maps the bulk local field φ(x) to a CFT
operator O[φ(x)] which has no support in an open set containing Y , and therefore
commutes with any local field of the CFT supported near Y . Since Y is an arbitrary
boundary point, if the CFT operator corresponding to φ(x) were actually unique, we
would conclude that O commutes with all local fields in the CFT, and therefore is a
multiple of the identity because the local field algebra is irreducible. This paradox is
evaded once we recognize that the correspondence is not unique. If Y, Z are two distinct
boundary points, the CFT operator corresponding to φ(x) can be chosen to be either O,
which commutes with CFT local fields supported near Y , or O0 , which commutes with
CFT local fields supported near Z, where O and O0 are inequivalent CFT operators
even though they can be used interchangeably for describing bulk physics.




                                         – 21 –
Figure 11. Bulk field reconstruction in the causal wedge. On the left is a spacetime diagram,
showing the full spacetime extent of the causal wedge C[A] associated with a boundary sub-
region A that lies within a boundary time slice Σ. The point x lies within C[A] and thus any
operator at x can be reconstructed on A. On the right is a bulk time slice containing x and Σ,
which has a geometry similar to that of our tensor networks. The point x can simultaneously
lie in distinct causal wedges, so φ(x) has multiple representations in the CFT.


     This novel feature of AdS/CFT, that a bulk local observable can be represented
by boundary CFT operators in multiple ways, is illustrated in figure 11. The idea
is that any fixed-time CFT subregion A defines a subregion in the bulk, the causal
wedge C[A]. For any point x ∈ C[A], bulk quantum field theory ensures that any bulk
local operator φ(x) can be represented in the CFT as some nonlocal operator on A.
This representation is called the AdS-Rindler reconstruction of the operator [34, 35].
Because a given bulk point x can lie within distinct causal wedges associated with
different boundary regions, the bulk operator φ(x) can have distinct representations in
the CFT with different spatial support.
     In [1] the non-uniqueness of the CFT operator corresponding to the bulk operator
φ(x) was interpreted as indicating that φ(x) is a logical operator preserving a code
subspace of the Hilbert space of the CFT. This code subspace is protected against
“errors” in which parts of the boundary are “erased.” If the boundary operator corre-
sponding to φ(x) acts on a subsystem of the CFT which is protected against erasure
of the boundary region Ac , then this operator can be represented in the CFT as an
operator supported on A, the complement of the erased region. Thus we may inter-
pret the AdS-Rindler reconstruction of φ(x) on boundary region A as correcting for
the erasure of Ac ; choosing the erased portion of the boundary in different ways leads




                                           – 22 –
to different reconstructions of φ(x). Moreover, operators near the center of the bulk
are “well protected” in the sense that a large region needs to be erased to prevent
their reconstruction, while operators near the boundary can be erased more easily by
removing a smaller part of the boundary [1].
     We may think of this code subspace as the low-energy sector of the CFT correspond-
ing to a relatively smooth dual classical geometry. All CFT operators are physical, and
thus have some bulk interpretation, but the “logical” operators are special ones which
map low-energy states to other low-energy states. The same logical action can be re-
alized by distinct CFT operators, as these distinct operators act on high-energy CFT
states (those outside the code subspace) differently even though they act on low-energy
states in the same way.

5.2   The physical interpretation of holographic codes
The error-correcting properties of the AdS/CFT correspondence were motivated in [1]
by bulk calculations, together with plausibility arguments regarding the CFT. Our
central observation in this paper is that analogous statements are provably true in
holographic codes.
    We emphasize that in holographic codes the uncontracted bulk legs hanging from
each tensor should not be thought of as tensor factors in addition to the boundary legs.
Rather the entire physical Hilbert space is spanned by states of the boundary legs only.
The bulk legs just provide a way of conveniently describing states in a certain code
subspace of this boundary Hilbert space, obtained by feeding states of the bulk legs
through the isometry defined by the entire tensor network; this code subspace can be
regarded as a simplified model of the low-energy states in a CFT.
    Likewise, operators acting on the dangling bulk indices correspond to nonlocal
operators in the boundary theory whose algebra and action on the code subspace re-
sembles what we would expect for the CFT description of how bulk local operators act
on low-energy CFT states. When we speak of a “bulk local operator” we really mean
the nonlocal boundary operator obtained by pushing an operator acting on a dangling
bulk index out to the boundary using the isometry defined by the network.

5.3   Bulk reconstruction from tensor pushing
We now explain how holographic codes realize the AdS-Rindler reconstruction of figure
11. The basic idea is that, instead of using the full isometry of the entire network
to push a local bulk operator to the boundary, we can instead successively push it
through individual perfect tensors in a manner of our choosing by using the operation of
figure 2. We illustrate the reconstruction for two different bulk points of the pentagon
code in figure 12. Here we use the defining property of perfect tensors — that the



                                        – 23 –
tensor provides a unitary transformation which maps any three legs of the tensor to
the complementary set of three legs, and therefore also an isometry mapping any set
of three or fewer “incoming” legs to any disjoint set of three “outgoing” legs. In figure
12, each bulk vertex with arrows showing incoming and outgoing directions indicates
such an isometry, and the complete set of blue legs is a product of such isometries, and
hence also an isometry. The blue operator on the boundary is obtained by conjugating
the blue bulk operator by the blue isometry, and the same applies to the green bulk
and boundary operators. In the construction of the isometry, we regard the dangling
bulk index on each tensor as an incoming index, and therefore require that no more
than two contracted indices are incoming for each blue (or green) tensor. The same
blue isometry, then, can be used to push not just the central blue bulk index to the
boundary, but also any of the other incoming bulk indices (which are not shown in the
figure) on blue tensors.




Figure 12. Boundary reconstruction of bulk operators. The blue operator on the central
bulk leg is pushed to an operator supported on a fairly large boundary region, while the
green bulk operator further from the center is pushed to an operator supported on a smaller
boundary region. Bulk legs for the other tensors are not shown.

    The boundary operation corresponding to a given bulk local operator manifestly has
the non-uniqueness we described in our discussion of the AdS-Rindler reconstruction.
For example, we could move one of the three blue arrows directed outward from the
central blue vertex to a different edge, thus reconstructing the central bulk operator
on a different boundary region, or we could have sent the green arrows in the opposite



                                          – 24 –
direction and reconstructed the green bulk operator on a considerably larger boundary
region on the opposite side. No matter which reconstruction we use, the boundary
operator is obtained from the isometric embedding of the bulk indices into the code
subspace of the boundary Hilbert space, and therefore each reconstructed operator
corresponding to a given bulk operator acts on the code subspace in the same way.
     In the theory of quantum error-correcting codes, we say that an error is an erasure
(or equivalently a located error ) if the set of spins damaged by the error is known,
so this information can be used in recovering from the error. Holographic codes also
provide protection against errors which act at unknown locations on the boundary,
but for the purpose of developing the analogy with the AdS/CFT correspondence we
will focus on protecting against erasure. A logical system can be protected against
erasure of a set of spins in the code block if the full algebra of logical operations has
a realization supported on the complementary set of unerased spins. In AdS/CFT we
might only require reconstruction of a subalgebra of the full logical algebra; for example,
the pentagon code provides better protection for the degrees of freedom deep within the
bulk than for those closer to the boundary. The framework in which a quantum code
protects only a subalgebra of the code’s full logical algebra has been called operator
algebra quantum error correction [36–39].

5.4   Connected reconstruction and the causal wedge
Given a subregion A of the boundary, which bulk local operators can be reconstructed
on A? This is not an easy question to answer in general, but at least we can give
a simple description of a large logical subsystem reconstructable on A, namely those
logical operators acting on bulk sites which are reachable using the greedy algorithm
explained in section 4.
     Recall that the greedy algorithm associates with any boundary region A a greedy
geodesic γA? whose boundary matches the boundary of A, such that A and γA? enclose
a tensor PA which defines an isometry mapping free bulk legs in PA together with the
legs cut by γA? to A. Using this isometry applied to any operator acting on a bulk leg
in PA (tensored with the identity acting on all the rest of the isometry’s input indices),
we may push that logical operator through the isometry to obtain its reconstruction on
A. Let’s call the position of a perfect tensor in the network a bulk point and say that
the greedy algorithm reaches a bulk point if it moves the cut past that tensor, hence
using it in the construction of PA
     This operator reconstruction procedure can be applied to any boundary region
A. In the special case where A is connected, it provides a precise analog of the AdS-
Rindler reconstruction in holographic codes, which we can formalize with a definition
and theorem:



                                          – 25 –
Definition 5. Suppose that A is a connected boundary region. The causal wedge
of A, denoted C[A], is the set of bulk points reached by applying the greedy algorithm
to A.

We then have:

Theorem 5. Suppose A is a connected boundary region. Then any bulk local operator
in the causal wedge C[A] can be reconstructed as a boundary operator supported on A.

We could have formulated a geometric notion of the causal wedge, defining it as the set
of bulk points enclosed between A and the actual minimal geodesic γA , rather than the
greedy geodesic. This geometrical definition is closer in spirit to how the term “causal
wedge” has been used in the context of AdS/CFT. But we prefer this greedy notion of
causal wedge instead, so that Theorem 5 is correct as stated.
     As figure 12 illustrates, bulk operators near the boundary can be reconstructed on
smaller connected regions than bulk operators near the center, just as for the AdS-
Rindler reconstruction in AdS/CFT. It is natural to wonder how large the connected
region A should be for the operator at the center of the bulk to be reconstructable
on A. This question is studied for the pentagon code in appendix C by investigating
whether the greedy algorithm applied to A reaches the central tensor in the network.
We find that a connected region of NA boundary spins necessarily allows reconstruction
of all operators acting on the center provided that A covers a sufficiently large fraction
of the boundary, namely
                                                 √
                                   NA        5+ 5
                          fA ≡            >          ≡ fc ≈ .724.                    (5.1)
                                Nboundary      10

The analogous result for the AdS-Rindler reconstruction is fc = 1/2, but the dis-
creteness of our lattice introduces some additional overhead. It turns out, though, that
because the tensor network is not invariant under translations of the boundary, whether
the connected region A allows reconstruction of the center depends not just on the size
of A but also on its location. In appendix C we show that, while the condition (5.1) is
needed to guarantee reconstruction of the central operator on an√ arbitrary connected
                                                        NA
region, there are some connected regions with fA = Nboundary = 3+10 5 ≈ .524 that suffice
for the reconstruction.

5.5   Disconnected reconstruction and the entanglement wedge
Now let’s consider what bulk operators can be constructed on boundary regions with
more than one connected component. First we extend the definition of the causal wedge
to disconnected regions:



                                         – 26 –
Definition 6. Suppose that A is a boundary region, which is a union of connected
components A1 , A2 , . . .. The causal wedge of A, denoted C[A], is defined as the union
                                                      S
of the causal wedges of the components of A, C[A] = i C[Ai ].

Since we have already established that any bulk operator in C[Ai ] is reconstructable
on Ai if Ai is connected, it follows immediately from this definition that even for
disconnected regions any bulk operator in C[A] is reconstructable on A.
    The causal wedge contains bulk operators which can be reconstructed when we
apply the greedy algorithm to the connected components of A one at a time. But the
greedy algorithm might advance further into the bulk, beyond the causal wedge, when
applied to A instead. Specifically, there could be a 2n-index tensor just beyond the
causal wedge of A with n or more legs crossing the union of greedy geodesics γA? i ∪ γA? j ,
even though fewer than n legs cross γA? i or γA? j individually. Then applying the greedy
algorithm to Ai ∪ Aj moves the cut past this tensor. This step may then render further
tensors eligible for inclusion, and in fact we will see that sometimes the greedy algorithm
can move far beyond the causal wedge C[A]




Figure 13. Disconnected reconstruction of a central operator beyond the causal wedge. Each
of two separate connected boundary regions is too small for reconstruction of the central
operator, yet the reconstruction is possible on the union of the two regions. In this example
the greedy algorithm reaches the central tensor when applied to both connected components
at once, but not when applied to either component by itself.

    A concrete first example illustrating reconstruction of a bulk operator outside the
causal wedge is shown in figure 13. In this example, A is the union of two connected
components A1 and A2 , and the full operator algebra of the central tensor can be pushed



                                           – 27 –
to either Ac1 or Ac2 . This implies that no nontrivial operator acting on the central tensor
can be pushed to either A1 or A2 . For every nontrivial operator φ in the algebra there
is another operator φ0 which does not commute with φ. If φ0 can be pushed to Ac1 ,
then surely φ cannot be pushed to A1 , because operators supported on complementary
regions must commute. The same argument applies to A2 . Yet the greedy algorithm
applied to A reaches the central tensor, showing that its full operator algebra can be
pushed to the union of A1 and A2 .
     That operators beyond the causal wedge of A can be reconstructed on A has deep
potential implications for AdS/CFT. Perturbative gravity techniques like the AdS-
Rindler reconstruction can be used to construct bulk operators in the causal wedge
but not beyond. Yet there has been speculation in the literature that reconstruction
should be possible in a larger region, the entanglement wedge [40], see also [41, 42, 67].
In AdS/CFT, the entanglement wedge E[A] is defined by first finding the minimal area
surface γA used in the RT formula, and then drawing a codimension one (i.e., two-
dimensional for AdS3 ) spatial slice in the bulk whose only boundaries are γA and A.
The bulk domain of dependence of this slice is then defined as the entanglement wedge
E[A]. The entanglement wedge contains the causal wedge, but can be much larger in
some cases. Figure 14 illustrates a simple example highlighting the distinction between
the causal and entanglement wedges.5
     We would like to investigate whether bulk operators in the entanglement wedge
are reconstructable for holographic codes, but how should the entanglement wedge be
defined? A definition of E[A] close to that used in AdS/CFT is:
Definition 7. Suppose A is a (not necessarily connected) boundary region. The ge-
ometric entanglement wedge of A is the set of bulk points in the bulk region
bounded by A and γA , where γA is the minimal bulk geodesic whose boundary matches
the boundary of A. If there is more than one minimal bulk geodesic, γA is chosen to
make the geometric entanglement wedge as large as possible.
    The main motivation for the conjecture that operators in the entanglement wedge
are reconstructable in AdS/CFT comes from the validity of the RT formula for discon-
nected regions. (Additional evidence was given in [1] based on a typicality argument.)
But we have already seen above that the RT formula does not hold exactly in holo-
graphic codes, so we should not necessarily expect the entanglement wedge conjecture
   5
     In excited states where the geometry deviates from pure AdS, there are differences between the
entanglement wedge and the causal wedge even for connected boundary regions. We will not try to
capture this in our toy models, since without a theory of dynamics we cannot capture the full spacetime
definitions of these regions. Our discussion is limited to the case where we stick with states near the
vacuum, in which case A needs to be disconnected for its causal wedge and entanglement wedge to
differ.

5.6   Erasure threshold
If the entanglement wedge conjecture is true for AdS/CFT, if holographic codes faith-
fully model the entanglement structure of boundary theories with classical gravitational
duals, and if the greedy entanglement wedge is a reasonable stand-in for the entangle-
ment wedge, then we should be able to find holographic codes and boundary regions
such that the greedy entanglement wedge reaches far outside the causal wedge. In this
section we provide examples which confirm this expectation. One way to formalize this
is to choose A to be a randomly chosen set of boundary spins, whose size is a specified
fraction of the total boundary. The geometry of the hyperbolic plane suggests that, if
A is large enough, the causal wedge C[A] will stick close to the boundary, yet the entan-
glement wedge E[A] reaches the center of the bulk with high probability; we illustrate
this in figure 15. We will see that not all holographic codes have this property, but we
are able to provide concrete examples that do.

it may have a very shallow causal wedge C[A] if each connected component is small. (b) In
contrast, if A comprises a sufficiently large fraction of the boundary, its entanglement wedge
E[A] will extend deep into the bulk.

      Another, perhaps better, way to formulate this case is to imagine a probabilistic
noise model which acts independently (without any noise correlations) on each of the
physical boundary spins, where each spin is either erased with probability p or left
untouched with probability 1 − p. If p is small, the set A of unerased boundary spins
breaks into many connected islands, where a typical island contains O(1/p) spins and
has a causal wedge which reaches into the bulk by only a constant distance. We can
show, though, that if the holographic code is properly chosen and the erasure probability
p is less than a threshold value pc , then E[A] contains the central bulk spin with a success



                                                    – 30 –
probability deviating from one by an amount which becomes doubly exponentially small
as the radius of the bulk increases.
     Which codes have an erasure threshold? One necessary requirement is that the
code must have a distance that increases with the system size. For the purpose of
reconstructing the central tensor in the bulk, this means that there should not be any
logical operator supported on a constant number of boundary spins which acts non-
trivially on the central bulk index. That’s because erasure of any constant number of
spins occurs with a nonzero constant probability, and recovery from the erasure error
is not possible if a nontrivial logical operator has support on the erased qubits.
     The pentagon code fails to fulfill this necessary condition. To illustrate the prob-
lem, it is helpful to consider first a simpler code, the “triangle code” constructed by
contracting four-index perfect tensors, where each leg is a 3-level spin, a qutrit. Each
triangle in the bulk has a dangling bulk index, and the code is constructed as a tensor
network forming a tree, the Bethe lattice; each triangle is contracted with one triangle
closer to the center and two triangles further from the center, as shown on the left side
of figure 16a. (Qi’s model [28] is based on a tensor network with a similar structure.)
One way to describe the greedy algorithm is to say that it propagates erasures from
the boundary toward the center of the bulk — the inward directed leg of a triangle is
erased if either of its outward directed legs is erased, and the central triangle can be
reconstructed only if at least two of that triangle’s legs are unerased.




                   (a) Triangle code                      (b) Pentagon code

Figure 16. Dangerous small erasures for the triangle (a) and pentagon codes (b). In the
triangle code erasing two boundary spins, boxed in blue, can prevent reconstruction of the
central tensor. In the pentagon code erasing four spins can prevent the reconstruction.

    It is easy, then, to prevent the greedy algorithm from reaching the center — only



                                         – 31 –
two spins need to be erased. A single erasure on the boundary propagates all the way up
to the center of the network, erasing one of the central triangle’s legs. A single erasure
on a different branch of the tree propagates up to another of the central triangle’s legs,
blocking the reconstruction of the central tensor on the remaining unerased spins.
     The greedy algorithm fails for a good reason. As described in appendix A.2, The
logical algebra for the three-qutrit code represented by a single triangle is generated by
logical operators of the form X̄ = X ⊗X −1 ⊗I, where X is a generalized Pauli operator;
in fact the code is symmetric under permutation of the three qutrits, so we can choose
X and X −1 to act on any two of the three qutrits without changing the operator’s
action on the code space. Now choose a path through the Bethe lattice which begins
on one leaf, travels to the center, exits the center on a different branch, and finally
reaches another leaf on that branch. Apply the operator X̄ to each of the logical bulk
indices visited by this path. Then for each leg along the path the X from the triangle
on one side cancels the X −1 coming from the triangle on the other side, except for one
uncanceled X on one leaf and one X −1 on the other. We conclude that the code admits
a logical operator acting nontrivially on the central triangle which has support on only
two boundary spins. That is why the central bulk spin can be damaged by erasing only
two boundary spins.
     For the pentagon code the situation is only slightly better. If we pick just four
spins at the positions shown on the right side of figure 16b, then the greedy algorithm
applied to the complement of these four spins never absorbs any of the tensors adjacent
to the dashed line. This failure is just a property of the graph defining the holographic
code, but once again we can understand the failure by noting that there is a logical
operator acting on the central pentagon supported on these four boundary spins, so
erasing these four spins prevents central bulk operators from being reconstructed on
their complement. Now we may consider a product of bulk logical operators acting on
the pentagons just above and just below the dashed line. We use the logical operator of
the five-qubit code X̄ = −Z ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ I ⊗ I described in appendix A.1, where X and
Z are Pauli operators (which square to one), and the operator’s action is unchanged
by cyclic permutations of the five qubits. Now X’s applied from either side of the cut
cancel on the legs crossed by the cut, and Z’s applied from either side cancel for the legs
just above and below the cut, leaving only four uncanceled Z’s acting on the boundary
qubits.
     Of course, uncorrectable damage deep inside the bulk caused by erasing just a
few boundary spins is not at all what we expect in AdS/CFT, where according to
the entanglement wedge conjecture we should always be able to reconstruct the center
of the bulk from a sufficiently large fraction of the boundary, whatever its shape or
location. To obtain a better model for AdS/CFT we should modify the holographic



                                          – 32 –
code, thinning out the algebra of bulk logical operators, and hence reducing the rate
of the code.
     A code that works better can be obtained by a simple modification of the pentagon
code — the modified tensor network is constructed by starting with a pentagon at the
center and adding alternating layers of hexagons (with no dangling bulk indices) and
pentagons (each with one bulk index) as the network grows radially outward. The
associated network is depicted in figure 17. This change suffices to remove all the
constant-weight logical operators acting nontrivally on the center and in fact we can
prove that this pentagon/hexagon code has an erasure threshold. Numerical studies
show that erasure can be corrected by the greedy algorithm with high success proba-
bility for p ≤ pgreedy
                c      ≈ 0.26; the erasure threshold pc achieved by the optimal recovery
method might be higher than pgreedy
                                  c    if the tensors have further special properties aside
from just being perfect.




              (a) Pentagon/Hexagon code                      (b) One qubit code

Figure 17. Tensor networks for holographic pentagon/hexagon codes with erasure thresh-
olds, where neighboring polygons share contracted indices. In the network shown on the left,
pentagons and hexagons alternate on the lattice; each pentagon carries one dangling bulk
index, and hexagons carry no bulk degrees of freedom. The logical qubit residing on the
central pentagon is well protected against erasure if the erasure probability on the boundary
is below the threshold value pc . In the network on the right, there is just a single bulk qubit
located at the center; the rest of the network is similar to the holographic state constructed
from hexagons only.

     Since our main interest is in the reconstruction of the center of the bulk, in appendix
D we study a code for which the only logical index resides at the center, also shown in
figure 17. This code is almost the same as the holographic state obtained by contracting
six-leg perfect tensors (hexagons), except that the tensor network contains one pentagon



                                            – 33 –
at the center; we therefore call it the single-qubit hexagon code. We prove the existence
of an erasure threshold for this code, and also derive an analytic lower bound on the
threshold erasure rate pc ≥ 1/12. Numerical evidence indicates that the threshold is
actually quite close to pc = 1/2.
    The lower bound on the threshold is derived using a simplified and less powerful
version of the greedy algorithm, the hierarchical recovery method, which begins at the
boundary and proceeds inward toward the center of the bulk. A tensor at level j + 1
of this hierarchy is connected to at least four tensors at level j, and the level-(j + 1)
tensor is erased if two or more of its level-j neighbors are erased. The proof proceeds
by recursively deriving an upper bound on the erasure probability pj at level j, finding
                                                      λj
                                                  p
                                    pj ≤ pc                  ,                      (5.2)
                                                  pc
                              √
where pc = 1/12 and λ = 1+2 5 . Thus the erasure probability for the central tensor
drops doubly exponentially with the radius of the bulk if p < pc , which means that the
central tensor can be reconstructed on the set of unerased boundary qubits with very
high probability.
    A tricky aspect of the proof is that, because a single level-j tensor couples to two
level-(j + 1) tensors, there are noise correlations which propagate from level to level.
Fortunately, the hyperbolic geometry controls the spread of correlations, making the
analysis manageable. In fact, correlations beyond nearest neighbors never arise. This
is one advantage of using the hierarchical recovery method rather than the greedy
algorithm. A similar proof strategy may also be applied to other holographic codes.

5.7   Holographic stabilizer codes
Stabilizer codes have been extensively studied in quantum coding theory, and are often
used in applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing [43]. Here we describe how to
construct a family of holographic codes which are also stabilizer codes. We introduce the
stabilizer formalism to pave the way for section 5.8, where we study some geometrical
properties of holographic stabilizer codes.
     Stabilizer codes can be defined for higher-dimensional spins as well, but here we
will assume the spins are qubits for simplicity. A Pauli operator acting on n qubits is
a tensor product of Pauli matrices, that is, one of the 4n operators contained in the set

                                     {I, X, Y, Z}⊗n                                 (5.3)

where I is the 2 × 2 identity matrix and X, Y, Z are the 2 × 2 Pauli matrices (often




                                         – 34 –
denoted σx , σy , σz ). We use [[n, k]] to denote a quantum code with k logical qubits
embedded in a block of n physical qubits. We say that an [[n, k]] code is a stabilizer
code (also called an additive quantum code), if the code space can be completely char-
acterized as the simultaneous eigenspace of n − k commuting Pauli operators. These
commuting Pauli operators are called the code’s stabilizer generators because they gen-
erate an abelian group called the code’s stabilizer group. The special case of a k = 0
stabilizer code is called a stabilizer state. We say that an n-index tensor is a stabilizer
tensor if the corresponding n-qubit state is a stabilizer state.
    For example, the six-index perfect tensor is a perfect stabilizer tensor, and holo-
graphic codes defined by tiling a hyperbolic geometry with pentagons are stabilizer
codes. More generally, we may formulate the following theorem:

Theorem 6. Consider a holographic code defined by a contracted network of perfect
stabilizer tensors, and suppose that the greedy algorithm starting at the boundary reaches
the entire network. Then the code is a stabilizer code.

To understand why Theorem 6 is true we need to see how to construct the code’s stabi-
lizer generators. To be concrete, consider holographic codes constructed from tilings by
hexagons and pentagons. The six-index perfect tensor defines a [[6,0]] stabilizer code,
whose stabilizers are enumerated in appendix A.1. As we have already noted, it also
defines isometries from any set of 1, 2, or 3 indices to the complementary set of indices;
these isometries may be regarded as the encoding maps for [[5, 1]], [[4, 2]], and [[3, 3]]
stabilizer codes respectively.
     To be specific, consider the [[5, 1]] code, and let M denote its isometric encoding
map taking a one-qubit input to the corresponding encoded state in the code block of
five qubits. We can characterize M by specifying how it acts on Pauli operators, which
(together with the identity) span the space of operators acting on a single qubit. Since
the Pauli group is generated by X and Z it suffices to specify

                               M : X 7→ X̄,    M : Z 7→ Z̄,                           (5.4)

where X̄ and Z̄ are the code’s logical Pauli operators, given explicitly in appendix A.
Similarly, the action on Pauli operators defines isometric encoders for the [[4, 2]] and
[[3, 3]] stabilizer codes, except that for e.g. the [[4, 2]] code we specify the action on
the four independent Pauli operators X1 , X2 , Z1 , Z2 , where the subscript 1, 2 labels the
code’s two logical qubits. For stabilizer codes the encoding isometry is always a Clifford
isometry, meaning its action by conjugation maps k-qubit Pauli operators to n-qubit
Pauli operators.




                                          – 35 –
     We already explained in section 3 that when the condition of Theorem 6 is satisfied
then the encoding isometry for the holographic code can be obtained by composing the
isometries associated with each perfect tensor in the network. A given tensor may
have 0, 1, 2, or 3 incoming legs, including the dangling bulk leg (if the tensor is a
pentagon) and all the incoming contracted legs, which are output legs from previously
applied isometries. To prove Theorem 6 then, it is enough to know that composing the
encoding isometries of two stabilizer codes yields the encoding isometry of a stabilizer
code.
     To see how this works, it is helpful to think about the simple special case of a con-
catenated quantum code, for which the tensor network is a tree. Consider in particular
a code with just one logical qubit — the central pentagon has one incoming logical leg
and five outgoing legs, while every other tensor is a hexagon with one incoming leg and
five outgoing legs. If the [[5, 1]] code is concatenated just once, the tensor network has
five hexagons and describes a [[25, 1]] stabilizer code. To obtain this code’s isometric
map, we first apply the encoding isometry M of the [[5, 1]] to the logical qubit, and
then apply M again to each one of the five outgoing qubits. If S denotes the stabilizer
group of the [[5, 1]] code, then the stabilizer of the [[25, 1]] code will include S acting on
each one of the five subblocks corresponding to the five hexagons in the tensor network.
But it also includes elements which act collectively on four of the five hexagons. For
example, as described in appendix A.1, one of the stabilizer generators for the [[5, 1]]
code is the Pauli operator X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X ⊗ I. The isometries associated with the five
hexagons map this operator to X̄ ⊗ Z̄ ⊗ Z̄ ⊗ X̄ ⊗ I, where now X̄, Z̄ are the logical
Pauli operators acting on the five outgoing qubits emanating from a single hexagon.
     The same idea applies to more general compositions of code isometries. Suppose
that S1 , M1 are the stabilizer group and encoding isometry for an [[n1 , k1 ]] stabilizer
code and that S2 , M2 are the stabilizer group and encoding isometry for an [[n2 , k2 ]]
stabilizer code. We may apply M2 to m of the n1 output qubits from M1 along with
k2 − m additional input qubits (where m ≤ n1 and m ≤ k2 ), thus obtaining an [[n1 −
m + n2 , k1 + k2 − m]] code. In fact this code is a stabilizer code, whose stabilizer
group is generated by S2 and M2 (S1 ); here we use a streamlined notation, in which
it is understood that operators and maps are extended by identity operators where
necessary, and we note that the elements of M2 (S1 ) are Pauli operators because M2 is
a Clifford isometry. Thus we have proven Theorem 6. It is also worthwhile to note that
the stabilizer group and encoding isometry for the holographic code can be efficiently
computed by composing the isometries arising from the perfect tensors in the network.




                                           – 36 –
5.8    Are local gauge constraints enough?
It has recently been argued that in AdS/CFT gauge constraints in the boundary CFT
may pick out a small enough subspace of states to explain the error correcting properties
of AdS/CFT [44]. The idea is that any gauge-invariant state already possess some non-
local entanglement via the imposition of the gauge constraints, and that this might be
enough to resolve the various paradoxes of [1].6
     We can try to test this idea for the holographic stabilizer codes discussed in section
5.7. Since gauge constraints are spatially local, the argument of Ref. [44] suggests
that the code’s stabilizer group should be locally generated, in the sense that it has
a complete set of generators, each with support on a constant number of neighboring
boundary qubits. In fact, though, holographic stabilizer codes do not have this property
in cases where the greedy entanglement wedge reaches outside the causal wedge. This
property poses no problem for the proposal of [1] however, as those authors argued that
energetic constraints should also be included in defining the code subspace.
     Consider for example the disconnected boundary region A = A1 ∪ A2 in the pen-
tagon code, depicted in figure 13. We have already seen that the full logical algebra of
the central pentagon can be reconstructed on the disconnected region A1 ∪ A2 , but that
no nontrivial logical operator acting on the central pentagon is supported on either
one of the connected components A1 , A2 . In a stabilizer code, a logical Pauli operator
supported on A1 ∪ A2 is a tensor product O = OA1 ⊗ OA2 of Pauli operators supported
on A1 and A2 separately. In order to preserve the code space, this logical Pauli operator
must commute with all of the code’s stabilizer generators. But if the two components
A1 and A2 are distantly separated and the stabilizer generators are geometrically local,
then no stabilizer generator has nontrivial support on both A1 and A2 . Any stabilizer
generator with no support on A2 trivially commutes with OA2 , and if it commutes with
O then it must commute with OA1 as well. Likewise, a stabilizer generator with no
support on A1 must commute with OA2 if it commutes with O. Therefore OA1 and OA2
are logical operators, and at least one is nontrivial if their product is, contradicting the
hypothesis that no nontrivial logical operator is supported on either connected com-
ponent of A. The conclusion is that the stabilizer generators cannot be geometrically
local.
     The above argument applies even to higher-dimensional holographic stabilizer codes.
In the case were the boundary is one dimensional, we may simply appeal to a known
   6
    The word “gauge” is sometimes used in quantum information theory in a way that is non-standard
from the point of view of quantum field theorists. In quantum field theory, states that are not gauge-
invariant have no physical interpretation, and are not really part of the Hilbert space of the theory;
they appear only as a mathematical convenience. This is what the authors of [44] meant by gauge
constraints, and it is what we mean here.

result in quantum coding theory, that a stabilizer code in one dimension with geometri-
cally local generators has constant distance [45, 46]. Therefore, a one-dimensional code
with a local stabilizer cannot have a positive erasure threshold.


6    Black holes and holography
In holographic codes, bulk operators are reconstructed only on a subspace of the bound-
ary Hilbert space. This may seem troubling, since the holographic correspondence is
supposed to assign a bulk interpretation to all possible states on the boundary. A
resolution of this confusion was proposed in [1] — a particular bulk operator might not
always be reconstructable because it lies deep inside a black hole for most boundary
states.7 In fact we can see this directly in our models if we incorporate black holes in
a manner that we now describe.
     To illustrate the idea, consider the pentagon code, but with the central tensor
removed. The central tensor’s one free bulk index has been replaced by five bulk
indices, those which had previously been contracted with legs of the missing pentagon;
the tensor network now provides an isometry mapping these five indices, together with
the bulk legs on the remaining pentagons, to the boundary. Thus the code subspace
of the boundary Hilbert space is larger than for the pure pentagon code. We interpret
this enlarged code space as describing configurations of the bulk with a black hole in
the center, whose microstate is determined by the input to the new bulk legs. The
entropy of the black hole is the logarithm of the dimension of the Hilbert space of black
hole microstates, or
                                                   
                               SBH = log2 25 − 2 ≈ 4.9,                             (6.1)
since only four of the bulk spins are new and we shouldn’t count states that were part
of the original pentagon code subspace. We depict this construction in figure 18a.
     We can construct larger black holes by removing more central layers of the network;
it is clear that their entropy scales with their horizon area, as predicted by Bekenstein
and Hawking [49, 50]. As the black hole grows, the number of bulk legs outside the
black hole decreases, so we can reconstruct fewer and fewer bulk local operators. Even-
tually the black hole eats up the entire network, and our isometry becomes trivial (and
unitary). Thus our model really does assign a bulk interpretations to all boundary
states, as demanded by AdS/CFT — most boundary states correspond to large black
holes in the bulk.
  7
    We are currently agnostic about the reconstruction of bulk operators just inside the horizon, which
must be needed in some form to describe the experience of an infalling observer. This is a topic of
much recent controversy [47, 48], but we will not take sides here.

    It is amusing to note that we can also describe configurations corresponding to
the two-sided wormhole of [2]; we just prepare two networks with central black holes
of equal size, and maximally entangle the bulk legs at their horizons, as shown in
figure 18b. It would be interesting to make contact with recent speculations about how
the length of the wormhole relates to the complexity of the tensor network describing
the state [51–53], although for that purpose we would probably need to incorporate
dynamics into our model.


7   Open problems and outlook
A remarkable convergence of quantum information science and quantum gravity has
accelerated recently, propelled in particular by a vision of quantum entanglement as the
foundation of emergent geometry. We expect this interface area to continue to grow
in importance, as practitioners in both communities struggle to develop a common
language and toolset. This paper was spurred by the connection between AdS/CFT
and quantum error correction proposed in [1]. We have strived to make this connection
more concrete and accessible by formulating toy models which capture the key ideas,
and we hope our account will equip a broader community of scientists to contribute to
further progress. Indeed, much remains to be done.
    First of all, the entanglement structure of holographic codes is not yet completely
understood. We would like a more precise characterization of the violations of the
Ryu-Takayanagi formula which can occur, and of the relationship between bulk residual
regions and the multipartite entanglement of the boundary state. How is the greedy

entanglement wedge different from the geometric entanglement wedge, and to what
extent does the greedy entanglement wedge reach beyond the causal wedge?
     We have not yet discussed the correlation functions of boundary observables in
holographic codes because we do not have much to say. In a stabilizer state |ψi, where
P and Q are Pauli operators, the expectation value hψ|P Q|ψi is either zero (if P Q
anticommutes with an element of the stabilizer) or a phase (if P Q commutes with the
stabilizer); the same conclusion applies to a stabilizer code unless P Q is a nontriv-
ial logical operator preserving the code subspace. In contrast, two-point correlations
in a CFT decay algebraically with distance; how might we recover this behavior in
holographic codes? Perhaps algebraic decay is recovered for non-stabilizer holographic
states, by defining suitable coarse-grained observables, or by injecting an encoded state
such that bulk correlation functions decay exponentially as in Ref. [28]. Or we might
replace perfect tensors by tensors which are nearly perfect.
     The behavior of two-point correlators highlights one way our toy models differ from
full-blown AdS/CFT, but there are other ways as well; for one, there is no obvious
analog of diffeomorphism invariance in a lattice model. What features in our lattice
model correspond to the 1/N corrections in the continuum theory? In AdS/CFT the
AdS radius is large compared to the Planck scale when the bulk theory is weakly
coupled, yet in the pentagon model for example the curvature scale is comparable to
the lattice cutoff. To approximate flatter bulk geometries we should study more general
tessellations, including higher dimensional ones. A particularly serious drawback of our
toy models so far is that we have not introduced any bulk or boundary dynamics. Can
holographic codes illuminate dynamical processes like the formation and evaporation
of a black hole?
     Finally, we have emphasized that holographic states and codes provide a concrete
realization of some aspects of AdS/CFT, but they may also be interesting for other
reasons, for example as models of topological matter. Furthermore, holographic codes
generalize the concatenated quantum codes that have been extensively used in discus-
sions of fault-tolerant quantum computing [43], and might likewise be applied for the
purpose of protecting quantum computers against noise. For this application it would
be valuable to develop the theory of holographic codes in a variety of directions, such
as studying tradeoffs between rate and distance, formulating efficient schemes for cor-
recting more general errors than erasure errors, and finding ways to realize a universal
set of logical operations acting on the code space.

A     Perfect tensor examples
In this section we will present the 5-qubit code, the 3-qutrit code and discuss possibil-
ities of constructing perfect tensors with a larger number of legs. The 5-qubit code is
a qubit stabilizer code of the form introduced in section 5.7 whereas the 3-qutrit code
can be described through a natural generalization of the stabilizer formalism to higher
spin dimensions.

A.1   5-qubit code and 6-qubit state
The five-qubit code is a [[5, 1, 3]]2 perfect code with distance 3 encoding one logical
qubit in five physical qubits. It is a stabilizer code with a stabilizer subgroup given by
S = hS1 , S2 , S3 , S4 i, where

                               S1 = X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X ⊗ I
                               S2 = I ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X
                                                                                    (A.1)
                               S3 = X ⊗ I ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z
                               S4 = Z ⊗ X ⊗ I ⊗ X ⊗ Z.

Note that S1 S2 S3 S4 = Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X ⊗ I ⊗ X and hence the group is manifestly invariant
under cyclic permutations. As is the case in the stabilizer formalism, codes are char-
acterized by an abelian stabilizer subgroup ([Si , Sj ] = 0) and codespace is the joint +1
eigenspace for this group, code states satisfy

                              Sj |ψi = |ψi     j = 1, . . . 4.                      (A.2)




                                         – 41 –
In this case, there are two orthogonal codeword states.
    Logical operators are unitary operators which preserve the codeword space, but
may act non-trivially on it. They are given by

               X =X ⊗X ⊗X ⊗X ⊗X                     Z = Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z.              (A.3)

One may see that both X and Z commute with all the stabilizer generators, so they
indeed preserves the codeword space. Yet, they anti-commute with each other, so they
characterize one logical qubit, and X and Z behave as logical Pauli-X and -Z operators
for a logical qubit. Namely, one can denote two codeword states by |0̃i and |1̃i such that
Z|0̃i = |0̃i, Z|1̃i = −|1̃i, X|0̃i = |1̃i, X|1̃i = |0̃i. Applications of stabilizer generators
to logical operators do not change the action on the codeword space, so representations
of logical operators are not unique. Then one can introduce the following equivalence
relations among logical operators

                        Z ∼ ZU        X ∼ XU          where U ∈ S                       (A.4)

as equivalent logical operators act in the same way on the codeword space. In particular,
one can conclude that on the codespace, X̄ ∼ −Z ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ I ⊗ I or any cyclic
permutation thereof by multiplying eq. A.3 by stabilizer generators in eq. A.1. In the
five-qubit code, one can show that logical operators must act non-trivially on at least
three physical qubits (weight 3) and the reduced density matrices on any two physical
qubits is always maximally mixed.
     One can convert the five-qubit code into a six-qubit perfect state. Imagine that we
add one extra qubit to the five-qubit code such that the new qubit is entangled with a
logical state of the five-qubit code. To be specific, we consider a six-qubit state whose
stabilized by S 0 = hS10 , S20 , S30 , S40 , S50 , S60 i, with generators are given by

                       S10 = X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X ⊗ I ⊗ I
                       S20 = I ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ X ⊗ I
                       S30 = X ⊗ I ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ I
                                                                                        (A.5)
                       S40 = Z ⊗ X ⊗ I ⊗ X ⊗ Z ⊗ I
                       S50 = X ⊗ X ⊗ X ⊗ X ⊗ X ⊗ X = X ⊗ X
                       S60 = Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z = Z ⊗ Z.

Here we have “recycled” stabilizer generators S1 , . . . , S4 from the five-qubit code:

                            Sj0 = Sj ⊗ I      for j = 1, . . . , 4.                     (A.6)




                                           – 42 –
We then constructed new stabilizer generators S50 and S60 from logical operators of the
five-qubit code as follows:

                               S50 = X ⊗ X         S60 = Z ⊗ Z                      (A.7)

where X and Z act on five qubits. One may easily check that stabilizer generators
commute with each other. The wavefunction is specified by

                                Sj0 |ψi = |ψi      j = 1, . . . , 6,                (A.8)

and the six-qubit state is given by |ψi = |0̃i ⊗ |0i + |1̃i ⊗ |1i. From the construction,
one can see that ρA ∝ IA if |A| ≤ 3. It turns out that this conversion is generic. That
is, one can always convert a perfect code with 2n − 1 spins into a perfect state with 2n
spins.

A.2     3 -qutrit code and 4-qutrit state
One of the simplest examples of perfect tensors is given by the three qutrit code. This
stabilizer code allows encoding one logical qutrit onto three physical qutrits in a way
that it may be recovered even after erasure of any single physical qutrit. The reason
for providing this additional example at this point is that we believe that this family of
perfect tensors may naturally be suited to generalizations leading to a continuum type
limit.
     The code states for this code can be given as follows.
                               √
                                   3|0̃i = |000i + |111i + |222i
                               √
                                   3|1̃i = |012i + |120i + |201i
                               √
                                   3|2̃i = |021i + |102i + |210i.

Correspondingly, the perfect state can be given explicitly as

                          3|[[4, 0, 3]]3 i =|0000i + |1110i + |2220i
                                         +|0121i + |1201i + |2011i
                                         +|0212i + |1022i + |2102i.

      The [[4, 0, 3]]3 state is determined by the following stabilizer group

                        S = hZZZI, ZZ −1 IZ, XXXI, XX −1 IXi,                       (A.9)

where we have omitted the three tensor product operator ⊗ between the qutrit Pauli
operators
                                                       

               001               100                 0 0 ω2

From this presentation of the stabilizer group, it becomes clear that this perfect state
corresponds to a self dual CSS code. 8 This separation of X and Z type operators,
and treating them on similar footing may potentially allow generalization to continuum
variable where position and momentum conjugate variables play a similar role.
    Like any other maximally entangled stabilizer state, given a bipartition, the [[4, 0, 3]]3
perfect state may be interpreted as a unitary gate belonging to the generalized Clifford
group. A second reason for presenting this code is that we can provide a simple and
explicit presentation of the corresponding Clifford circuit. In the case of the [[4, 0, 3]]3 ,
the corresponding Clifford is composed to two controlled adder gates which are run in
opposite directions one after the other.

                       U[[4,0,3]]3 = |x1 , x2 i → |2x1 + x2 , x1 + x2 i =                (A.11)

A.3    Large n
In order to obtain perfect tensors for large n, one needs to increase v as well, with the
                                                                                 √
first known construction [54] having v ∝ O(n). A construction with v ∝ O( n) was
later proposed [55].
     While perfect tensors are essential in guaranteeing the isometric properties used in
the analysis of holographic codes, they do require a large degree of fine tuning for their
construction. An interesting observation is that according to canonical typicality, most
pure states are almost maximally entangled along any balanced bi-partition [56, 57].
Hence Haar random states may in some sense provide a good approximation to perfect
states. This is not meant in the sense of trace distance. The observation is that random
states will except for a measure zero subset have full rank along any bipartition. This
allows operators to be pushed from lower dimensional side to higher dimensional side
in a way similar to figure 2. The only difference being that in this case normalization
is not preserved (if it was there to begin with). Furthermore, the average bipartite
entanglement of random states is very close to maximal. For this reason, we might
expect that they typically do not change normalization too drastically.
  8
    For CSS codes, the stabilizer group can be decomposed into X part and Z part. Self-dual means
that the stabilizer subgroups for the X and the Z part have exactly the same form.

B    Proof of RT for negatively curved planar graphs
As we have presented in eq. 4.4, there is an upper bound on the amount of entanglement
a tensor network state can have based on the minimal cut γA dividing the network into
two tensors P and Q. In this section, we will explain how to guarantee that this
upper bound is saturated for connected regions in a certain class of holographic states.
Namely, we shall focus on holographic states associated to planar graphs with non-
positive curvature.
    We argued that proving the RT formula amounts to showing that the tensors P
and Q can be interpreted as unitary transformations, from the minimal geodesic cut
γA together with some subregion of A or Ac to the rest of A or Ac respectively. We will
show that this is indeed the case by giving unitary circuit interpretations to the tensor
networks for each of them.
    Indeed, the following are necessary and sufficient conditions for a circuit interpre-
tation of a network of perfect tensors:

    • Covering: Each edge (contracted or uncontracted index) is assigned a direction-
      ality.

    • Flow: Each tensor has an equal number of incoming and outgoing indices.

    • Acyclic: The resulting directionality has no closed cycles (no loops).

The covering condition is necessary to interpret the direction in which each tensor in
the network processes information by having well defined inputs and outputs. The flow
condition is necessary for the interpretation of every tensor to be that of a unitary
gate. The acyclic condition is non-local and guarantees that the order of application of
the operations in the network is consistent, where an inconsistency may be thought of
as the presence of closed time-like curves in the circuit picture. These conditions are
enough to show that the interpretation is that of a unitary quantum circuit.
    One additional condition is required in order to prove the saturation of the RT
entanglement entropy, for a simply connected boundary region A.

    • Equal time interpretation: The minimal cut γA is crossed in the same direction
      by the directed interpretation of each link that it cuts.

This condition allows viewing the geodesic as an “equal time” curve in the unitary
circuit interpretation of the tensor network.
    Let us first describe the construction for the circuit interpretation. The steps may
be readily visualized in figure 19a.




                                         – 45 –
     In a planar graph we can associate a minimal cut γA to a path through the dual
graph, and since we are taking A to be connected, this path will also be connected. We
may associate two nodes in the dual lattice at the end points of a simply connected
boundary region A, which will also be the endpoints of γA in the dual lattice. We will
take one of these nodes to be the starting node and label it 0. We may then label all
other nodes in the dual lattice according to the distance (number of steps/cuts) from
the starting node. Since γA is a minimal geodesic, this labeling monotonically increases
along the nodes it traverses.
     We may now assign an orientation to edges (contracted indices) in the tensor net-
work. The orientation is chosen such that, from the two adjacent nodes of the dual
lattice, the node with higher label is always found to the right. This orientation may
be interpreted as the direction of “flow of information” through the circuit.
     We now argue that this orientation gives a unitary circuit interpretation for P (and
thus for Q by exchanging A and Ac ). We emphasize that the argument rests on the
following assumptions about the graph:

   • Planar embedding: The tensor network may be laid out in a planar fashion
     with the boundary of the network corresponding to a simple boundary on the
     embedding.

   • Perfect tensors: Tensors in the network have an even number of legs and are
     unitary along any balanced distribution of the legs.

   • Curvature: The network is expected to represent an AdS bulk and thus is
     expected to have the discrete analogue of negative curvature. We have not tried
     to define this idea in general, but the aspect of it we need here is that the distance
     function between two nodes of the network has no local maxima away from the
     boundary.

     We have already used the planar embedding assumption implicitly by constructing
the dual lattice and referring to right and left. It is however less obvious that we
have also made a restricted use of the perfect tensor assumption. Namely, we have
used the fact that each tensor has an even number of legs. Because of this, the dual
lattice is bipartite. In other words, nodes may be labeled with two “colors” which
we shall conveniently call ‘even’ and ‘odd’ such that two nodes of the same color are
never adjacent. In particular, the parity of the distance labeling coincides with the
“color”. Hence, two neighboring nodes can not have the same value label making the
directionality of the tensor index between them always be well defined (i.e. satisfies
covering condition).




                                         – 46 –
     To ensure the flow condition, it suffices to count the number of incoming indices
minus the number of outgoing indices and verify that this value is zero. Due to the
triangle inequality, and the bipartite nature, labels for neighboring nodes can only differ
by one. Hence, the difference between the number of outgoing and incoming indices
                                            P
for any tensor in the network is given by 2n   j=1 (fj+1 − fj ) = 0, where fj are the labels
associated to the 2n nodes immediately surrounding the tensor taken in cyclic order.
     The acyclic condition is a bit more subtle since it is a non-local property. We
will prove that the presence of a cycle in this context implies the existence of an
interior local maximum for the labeling. Let us assume that our construction produces
some cycle C in the tensor network. Depending on the orientation of C (clockwise or
counterclockwise), the the node label values immediately to the interior of the loop will
be larger or smaller than those immediately to the exteriors. In the counterclockwise
case, we may chose a node in the interior of C with lowest possible label. The label for
this node is smaller than those of all its neighbors, including those in the exterior of C,

Figure 19. Here we illustrate how to construct a unitary circuit interpretation of a holo-
graphic state which witnesses the RT entanglement for a simply connected boundary region.
(a) The following steps for the construction are illustrated: i) Label the node located at one
end of the boundary as 0. ii) Label all other nodes according to the distance from this node.
iii) Direct all tensor indices such that the larger label lies to the right. (b) In the example,
the circuit interpretation for the network has depth 12. For this reason we provide a full se-
quential presentation of the circuit interpretation along one side of the geodesic, condensing
the remaining 7 gates into UAc . Note that there are outputs that are produced directly by
UA , without going through UAc as well as inputs that are fed directly to UAc without going
through UA .

which contradicts the assumption that it is defined based on a graph distance function.
In the clockwise case, we may choose a node in the interior of C with the largest possible
label. In this case the label for this node is larger than that of all its neighbors, including
those outside of C. In other words, we have found an interior maximum for the distance
function. This is in contradiction with our stand-in assumption associated to negatively
curved surface homeomorphic to the disc, which leads us to the conclusion that our
construction produces no loops.
    Finally, it is straightforward to show that the geodesic γA can be provided an equal
time interpretation in the circuit. Firstly, it completely splits the circuits in two parts.
Secondly, the direction associated to all contracted indices crossed by γA is uniform
since the nodes it transverses are by definition labeled in strict ascending order.


C     Counting tensors in the pentagon code
C.1    Counting tensors
In this appendix we compute some basic properties of the pentagon code that we quoted
in the text. In these computations it is useful to “unwrap” the code, as in figure 20.
The central tensor is placed at the bottom, which we will refer to as the zeroth layer, the
first five tensors as the first layer, and so on, with the layer number n being equivalent
to the graph distance to the central tensor.
     At each layer, it is clear that there are two kinds of tensors: those with one leg
connected to the previous layer and those with two. We will denote the numbers of
these at layer n as fn and gn , so for example f1 = 5 and g1 = 0. Moreover if we group
these together as a two component vector, we have the recursive equation
                                           

at any n via

which reproduces equation (3.1).

C.2   Connected reconstruction
We’ll now compute the size of connected boundary region that we need to reconstruct
operators on the logical leg of the central (n = 0) tensor. This is complicated by the
fact that our network is not translationally invariant; whether or not we can reconstruct
the center depends not only on the size of the boundary region we have access to but
also where it is. The “best case” situation is illustrated in figure 21.
     We can compute the number of physical qubits in the best-case region by growing
the tree it bounds: we start with f1 = 3 and g1 = 0, and then proceed as before by
applying M repeatedly, being careful to remove two tensors at the ends at each layer.

After cutting off the tree at level n the number of physical qubits in the best-case region
will be Nbest = 4fn + 3gn − 3, and by diagonalizing M we see that asymptotically

                                Nboundary      10

    We can also study the “worst case” location of the region, which is shown in figure
22. To compute its size in the large n limit we only need to replace the initial condition
f1 = 3, g1 = 0 by f1 = 4, g1 = 0, and we find
                                                √
                                Nworst      5+ 5

                              Nboundary       10

which reproduces (5.1).
    We can connect this worst-case result to the “bad” sets of points from figure 16b
that prevent a general threshold for this code: these points are shown in figure 23.

    Similar calculations are possible in the pentagon-hexagon code we introduced to
restore the threshold, we find

                                             38


with the two cases being whether the last layer is taken to be pentagons (n even) or
hexagons (n odd). The rate is thus relatively small compared to (C.6), which suggests
that this code should be better protected against erasures, as indeed we find. The
rate when n is odd is smaller since it throws in an extra level of hexagons without any
new logical legs. We can also compute the sizes of the best and worst case connected
reconstructions of the center, we find
                                              √

                                Ntot         20

These are smaller than the pentagon results, as expected since the code is denser, and
are closer to the AdS/CFT value of 1/2.


D     Estimating greedy erasure thresholds
Noise models which are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) are usually
analytically tractable while providing reasonable predictive capability based on the few
parameters defining the individual noise model. In the case of erasure noise, this is
particularly simple since the only parameter is , the erasure probability per qubit. In
addition to randomized bench-marking it is sometimes instructive to provide analytic
bounds on how small the error/erasure probability needs to be in order to guarantee
a recovery probability for the encoded data which approaches unit. This can give us
information about the scaling of the logical error probability with other parameters of



                                            – 51 –
the code. A complementary approach consists of providing precise numerical estimates
of the threshold value pc based on numerical simulations.

D.1    Analytic bounds
In this section, we derive such an analytic upper bound on the probability of logi-
cal error. The goal of the section is to provide an example of how such a bound is
derived illustrating a proof technique and obtaining a functional form for the logical
error probability. We do not strive to derive a tight bound or address a particularly
relevant holographic code scenario. In fact, the recovery procedure we model is strictly
weaker than the one provided by the greedy algorithm which is itself weaker than an
optimal erasure recovery algorithm. The model we analyze is essentially identical to
the holographic hexagon state except that instead of starting from a single [[6, 0, 4]]
tensor at the center, we start with a single [[5, 1, 3]] and build up n layers of [[6, 0, 4]]
tensors from there. We shall call this the single qubit hexagon code and its analysis is
essentially identical to that of a holographic hexagon state.
     For this code we obtain the following conclusion.

Theorem 7. Consider a single qubit hexagon code with n layers and an i.i.d. erasure
probability for physical qubit given by  ≤ ? . Then it is possible to recover the central
logical qubit with probability p greater than
                                                    λn
                                    p ≥ 1 − ?              .                          (D.1)
                                                  ?
                             √
Here, ? = 1/12 and λ = 1+2 5 .

     This is the same functional form associated to concatenated error correcting codes.
Namely, the loss probability for the logical data decays doubly exponentially with the
“depth” n of the code or exponentially with the number of physical spins. We would
expect to get a result of the same form for any such code with an erasure threshold. The
only expected difference being the value of the threshold ? and the scaling dimension
λ. We will now prove the theorem as an illustration to obtaining these values. Since
we will use a simplified hierarchical recovery procedure, the proof technique will be
essentially equivalent to that of concatenated codes. An interesting open problem is
to provide an analytic threshold analysis fully respecting the greedy algorithm which
corresponds to the problem of bootstrap percolation [58]. We have numerically analyzed
this problem or the qubit hexagon code and found ? ≈ 0.48(2) whereas independent
analytic arguments particular to this model predict an erasure threshold of ? = 1/2
for an optimal recovery protocol.




                                           – 52 –
Proof. We will consider a hierarchical recovery model which is even simpler and can
not perform better than the greedy algorithm. Namely, we may provide a coupling
[59] between the probability distributions over recovered tensors such that the set of
recovered tensors by the greedy algorithm always includes the set of tensors recovered
by the hierarchical recovery. The reason for this is that the hierarchical algorithm can
be interpreted as n iterations of the greedy algorithm where tensors a distance j from
the boundary may be incorporated only during iteration j. The difference with the
greedy algorithm, is that once the greedy algorithm recovers a tensor at distance j + 1
from the boundary, it allows itself to reinspect its neighboring tensors at distance j
and incorporate those. This may in general lead to highly non-trivial sequences for
incorporating tensors in the bulk. The sequential nature of the hierarchical recovery
model allows establishing a clear dependence between the tensors.
     In the hierarchical recovery model, each level consists of a ring of tensors, which
are only connected with the next level and the previous. In order to adequately model
the errors at each level, we will need to inductively provide bounds for different error
configurations. Assuming we are dealing with the hexagon lattice with four hexagons
adjacent per vertex, it will be sufficient to deal with two types of bounds, one for single
errors (single missing tensor) and the second for pairs of neighboring missing tensors.
We will call these bounds s and d for single and double and we will use a subindex j
to label the layer to which these bounds apply.
     Initially, we have s0 =  and d0 = 2 which corresponds to assuming an i.i.d. erasure
model with each physical index being erased with probability . The core of the proof
is simply to recursively bound sj+1 and dj+1 in terms of sj and dj .
     A non-trivial observation, is that we do not need to consider erasure correlations
beyond nearest neighbors. Due to the hierarchical structure which is contracting, cor-
related erasures beyond nearest neighbors of a chain can not exist (see figure 24). This
is an artifact of having chosen a privileged “re-normalization” direction and is an effect
analogous to having all scaling operators be three body in MERA. In fact, long range
correlations between tensors do arise in the recovery model dictated by the greedy al-
gorithm. Here e indicates where a reconstruction index is missing or erased whereas ?
indicates that the index could be missing or available.
     Considering all error configuration at layer j which could lead to errors at layer
j + 1, we may bound

                                 sj+1 ≤ 3dj + 3s2j                                   (D.2)
                                 dj+1 ≤ 3sj (3dn + 3s2j ).                           (D.3)

Here, we have aimed for simplicity instead of tightness of the bound. Let us give a

brief explanation for the RHS of equations D.2 and D.3.
    Since each hexagon has at least 4 legs connected to lower layers, two of its neighbor-
ing tensors (within four legs) need to be missing such that tensor fails to be recovered
from the lower layer. For this to happen, there must either be two neighboring indices
missing from the lower chain or two non-neighboring indices missing. There are three
ways for this to happen illustrated by the following minimal error strings

                                   {ee ? ?, ?ee?, ? ? ee,                           (D.4)
                                  e ? e?, e ? ?e, ?e ? e}.                          (D.5)

These scenarios cover all possible situations leading to the failure of hierarchical re-
construction (some of the, more unlikely ones such as eeee are being covered multiple
times).
     Similarly, we may account for all possible scenarios that lead to a double erasure ee
at level j +1 Two consecutive tensors at chain j +1 always share exactly one descendant
which may provide a source of correlated errors. Furthermore, at least one of the two
tensors at layer j + 1 will have a total of five descendants. As an overestimate of dj we
may disregard the value of the joint descendant. Regardless, we know that there should
be two erasures in the remaining four descendants of the tensor with five descendants
and at least one erasure among the outermost three descendants of the other tensor
(see figure 25).
     Assuming sj ≥ dj ≥ s2j which must hold for such a model, we may extract the
dominant (smallest) exponent for  associated to the sj and dj bounds given by the
recursion relation

one of them needs to have five. Irrespective of the availability of a shared descendant there

erasures.

This allows us to reach the conclusion of the theorem with ? = s? and λ = φ+ .

     A bounding procedure similar to this one may also be applied to the code involving
alternating layers of pentagons and hexagons as for many other holographic codes with
certain regularity structure. We have only restricted to consider the hexagon lattice
to exemplify the kind of reasoning involved. In the case of the holographic pentagon
code, there is no way to make such an argument work and there is a good reason for
this. Namely there are constant weight 4 logical operators affecting the central qubit
in the holographic pentagon code. The way this becomes manifest when attempting a
similar proof approach is by obtaining a scaling dimension λ = 1.

D.2   Numerical evaluation
We may numerically evaluate the probability for the greedy algorithm to absorb the
central tensor given a boundary region constructed by erasing a random set of physical
indices according to an i.i.d. distribution. This gives us a conservative estimate of how
well protected the central qubit is from i.i.d. erasure since an optimal recovery method
can only do better. We perform such estimates for different values of the lattice radius
in order to identify the value pc associated to a correctability phase transition. For
the regular pentagon lattice tensor network we find that there is no indication of the
central qubit being well protected.
     Given that the pentagon code does not have a threshold, we introduce the pen-
tagon/hexagon code as a similar example that does have an erasure threshold in this
context. It is the regular lattice composed of pentagons and hexagons, with two pen-
tagons and two hexagons adjacent at each vertex. Such a lattice might employ [[6, 0, 4]]2
and [[5, 1, 3]]2 tensors. Intuitively, we expect that by diluting the number of logical
legs, we may obtain better protection for the encoded logical qubits. Indeed, for such
a lattice, we find that there is a threshold value p∗ such that if the i.i.d. probability
of boundary erasure is smaller than p∗ , then the central logical qubit may be recon-
structed with a probability which approaches one as the cutoff radius of the lattice is
increased. Such a statement can be proven using techniques very similar to the thresh-
old proof of section D.1. We have numerically tested the performance of the greedy
recovery algorithm for recovering the central qubit in three possible lattices (see figure
26) supporting our claim that a lower density of logical legs leads to a higher tolerable
erasure threshold.


E     Reconstructing beyond the greedy algorithm
The greedy algorithm provides an explicit prescription for representing bulk logical
operators on a specified region of the boundary. A key virtue is that the region obtained
does not depend in any way on the specific perfect tensors used to construct the network.
In this sense, it is analogous to the AdS/Rindler reconstruction, which is explicit and
applicable to a large family of models satisfying a holographic correspondence.

E.1   Reconstruction from symmetry guarantees
The greedy entanglement wedge falls short of the expectations for a geometric entan-
glement wedge in certain ways. For instance, in the scenario where the minimal surface
separating A from Ac is well defined, we expect E[A] ∪ E[Ac ] to contain the full lattice.

Figure 26. Here we present Monte Carlo simulation for the probability of the central tensor
being incorporated by the greedy algorithm applied to a holographic code. The greedy algo-
rithm is applied to a region A constructed by randomly taking each boundary physical index
to belong to A with probability p. We plot the central tensor containment probability in the
greedy wedge according to the lattice radius (i.e. the distance from the central tensor at which
the a priory infinite network is truncated). (a) We consider the holographic pentagon code
of figure 4b. Numerical results remains consistent with the existence of five possible weight 4
representations of the string-like logical operators acting on the central qubit. (b) We focus
on the pentagon/hexagon code of figure 17a which has an erasure threshold in terms of the
recoverabilty. We observe some oscillatory behavior due to the fact that tensor ‘layers’ added
alternate between pentagons and hexagons. (c) We present numerical data for the greedy
algorithm applied to the 1 qubit hexagon code of figure 17b which corresponds to a tensor
network identical to the holographic hexagon state except for having a single pentagon at its
center.

Our first example of reconstruction beyond the greedy wedge involves a family of holo-
graphic stabilizer codes with a single logical qudit. In this case, perfect reconstruction
on either A or its complement Ac can be guaranteed by exploiting a symmetry.
     Particularly, the three qutrit stabilizer code of section A.2 is of CSS [60] type, a
property which we can show is inherited by any derived holographic code by following
the arguments of section 5.7. Furthermore, the qutrit Hadamard operator H is a
symmetry of the qutrit code meaning that applying H to all tensor indices preserves
the tensor. The Hadamard operator is symmetric, unitary but generally not Hermitian

Figure 27. In (a) we represent a bipartite network composed of tensors with a symmetry
H and H ∗ . We alternate applying H (solid squares) and H ∗ (hollow squares) to all legs of
tensors in the bipartite tensor network. In (b) we represent the same tensor network where a
portion A of the boundary was marked with hollow dots and its complement Ac was marked
with full dots. The regions A and Ac have been chosen such that the greedy algorithm does
not progress on either. The greedy algorithm will recover the full network when initiated
from the full boundary showing that the network indeed corresponds to a holographic code.


tensor network10 . To see this, we multiply each tensor leg either by H or its inverse
H † = H ∗ . Since each individual tensor is invariant under such an action, the full
tensor network should be invariant. Furthermore, if we assume that the tensor network
graph is bipartite we may alternate multiplication by H and H † such that these may
locally cancel on all contracted indices, as depicted in figure 27a. We are then left
with a symmetry acting exclusively on the free bulk and boundary legs of the tensor
network. This symmetry guarantees a form of duality between X-type logical operator
and Z-type logical operators where dual operators have exactly the same support.
    Theorem 1 in of Ref. [64] precisely relates the number of independent logical
operators supported on complementary subsets of qudits. Their result applies to general
subsystem codes and includes a sharper claim for CSS codes [65]. In particular, for any
subset A of qudits, one may define `(A) to be the number of independent Pauli logical
operators supported exclusively on A.

Lemma 1. Given a stabilizer code with k logical qubits, `(A)+`(Ac ) = 2k. Furthermore
if the code is of CSS type, we have `Z (A) + `X (Ac ) = k = `Z (Ac ) + `X (A), where `X
and `Z denote the number of X-type and Z-type generators respectively.
  10
    Here we limit ourselves to provide the simplest example which conveys the general spirit of deriving
global symmetries from local tensor symmetries [61]. The state of the art for this line of reasoning in
tensor networks can be found in [62, 63].




                                                – 58 –
    This is called the cleaning lemma for stabilizer codes and applies to prime dimension
qudits11 .
    Assume that we are dealing with a CSS code with a single logical qudit, k = 1
and a Hadamard type symmetry which guarantees `X (A) = `Z (A). From this we may
exclude the case `(A) = `(Ac ) = 1 and conclude that the full logical algebra may
be reconstructed either on A or on Ac . This conclusion is analogous to E[A] ∪ E[Ac ]
covering the full bulk, which is expected from the usual geometric entanglement wedge.
In contrast, the greedy algorithm does not provide such a guarantee for the greedy
entanglement wedge. Figure 27b illustrates a partition of the boundary of a tensor
network into two regions such that the greedy algorithm does not make progress in
either region. The same tensor network may be associated to a CSS type stabilizer
code with self-duality properties where all the previously exposed arguments apply.
    The same cleaning lemma may be used to guarantee that when |Ac | = 4 qubits are
deleted, at least 2k − 8 independent logical Pauli operators can be reconstructed on A,
where k is the number of logical qubits in the code12 . In the context of the example of
figure 16b, even though the greedy entanglement wedge of A lacks a large number of
tensors, the number of missing generators to reconstructed the full algebra is small.

E.2    Approximate reconstruction for typical tensors
Consider a connected residual region R obtained after removing the greedy entangle-
ment wedge associated to boundary region A and the one associated to its complement
Ac . A “typical” residual region will be composed of randomly chosen perfect tensors
without any specific symmetry imposed. In this case, we may average the entanglement
entropy associated to boundaries γA? and γA? c . We expect that for |γA? | ≥ |γA? c | + nR the
map from the bulk logical indices and the smaller boundary onto the larger one will
generically be full rank. Furthermore, we conjecture that for random perfect tensors,
the average value of SA will approach |γA? c | + nR exponentially with |γA? | − |γA? c | − nR .
We expect an argument analogous to that of Ref. [66] to allow us to reach such a
conclusion. In turn this would imply that the logical operators in the residual region
can be reconstructed on γA? (and in turn on A) to a good approximation.

    Let us clarify that the operators representable on A and on Ac need not be mutually independent.

    In fact, a slightly more careful analysis allows us to conclude that at least 2k − 2 independent
generators may be represented on A.
