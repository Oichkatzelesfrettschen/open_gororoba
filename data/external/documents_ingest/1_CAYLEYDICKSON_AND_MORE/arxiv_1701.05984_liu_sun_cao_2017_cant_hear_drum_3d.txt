                                                   NO as shown through the construction of iso-spectral domains. There already exists 17 fam-

                                           1       Introduction
                                           The famous question as to whether the shape of a drum can be heard has existed for half a
                                           century[1], which deduces to the eigenvalues problem of a vibrating membrane in the Euclidean
                                           space. Thus if you know the frequencies at which a drum vibrates, can you determine its shape?
                                           As we know, the vibration of a drum which spans a domain Ω in R2 is governed by the wave
                                           equation with Dirichlet boundary

                                                                        ∂2ν
                                                                                2

                                                                                             

                                                                            −        +         = 0,     in Ω,                        (1.1)

                                                                               ν = 0,                               on ∂Ω,                              (1.2)
                                           where ν = ν(x, y, t) denotes the transverse displacement of a point (x, y) in Ω at time t. Seeking
                                           a solution by separation of variables ν(x, y, t) = F (t)u(x, y), we obtain the stationary equation

                                           It is classical that there is an ordered set {λk , k = 1, 2, . . .} known as eigenvalue spectrum.

                                                                     0 < λ1 < λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λk . . . ; λk → +∞, if k → +∞.                               (1.5)

                                           The value λk relates to the frequency of the drum with corresponding eigenfunction uk . Two
                                           bounded domains, Ω1 and Ω2 , which have the same set of eigenvalues are called iso-spectral.
                                           Additionally, Ω1 and Ω2 are termed isometric if they are congruent in the sense of Euclidean
                                           geometry. It is the popularization of Kac’s question as to whether there can exist two iso-spectral

but non-isometric domains in the real face. It wasn’t until 1992 that Gordon et al. [12] answered
negatively by finding a pair of non-isometric planar domains with the same Laplace spectrum.
    Actually at Kac’s time it was known that the answer is NO in the realm of Riemannian
manifolds. J. Milnor had constructed two flat tori of dimension 16 which are iso-spectral but not
isometric [2]. In the ensuing 25 years many examples of iso-spectral manifolds mathematically
were found, whose dimensions, topology, and curvature properties were discussed. For more
detailed specification, please see [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The crucial step was achieved in 1985 by
Sunada [10]. The simplest, but abstract theorem gives a sufficient condition for building pairs of
iso-spectral manifolds. So, the paradigmatic example given by Gordon et al. was also generated
from Sunada’s theorem. In fact, the other examples which were constructed after 1992 all
followed Sunada’s theorem. Buser et al. gave 17 families of iso-spectral pairs in planar case, and
a particularly simple method called transplantation technique for detecting iso-spectrality [16].
Interestingly, Chapman has visualized the transplantation map in terms of “paper-folding” [23].
With the paper-folding method, it is clear that what matters is the way how the building blocks
are glued together (i.e. reflection rule), irrespective of their shape. More exotic iso-spectral
shapes can be made just following the same patten of reflection rule.
    It should be remarked that the transplantation method is not independent of the Sunada’s
theorem. In a summary paper [17], Brooks present four proofs of the Sunada’s theorem including
the alternative proof based on the transplantation method. Continuously, Okada and Shudo
employed the transplantation method to verify the equivalence between iso-spectrality and iso-
length [18]. 17 families of iso-length graph called “transplantation pairs” were enumerated to
compare with the preexisting planar iso-spectral pairs. Following the edged-graph proposed in
[18], theoretical physicist Giraud made a C program to exhaust all possible pairs numerically
[25][26]. He blazed a trial combining with the finite projective plane approach to explain the
reasons for the existence of iso-spectral pairs. Still, essentially only 17 families of examples
that say no to Kac’s question were constructed in a 50 year period. Thus far, all examples of
non-congruent iso-spectral domains in Euclidean space are non-convex. Please see [13, 14] for
the convex domain in hyperbolic plane. Giraud and Thas [27] have done good job by reviewing
mathematical and physical aspects of iso-spectrality, covering wide range of knowledge including
also pioneering contributions of the authors.
    Although iso-spectrality is proved on mathematical grounds, the knowledge of exact eigenval-
ues and eigenfunctions can not be obtained analytically for such systems. Experiments including
numerical investigation and physical implementation contribute a lot. Early in 1994, Wu and
Sprung [28] verified the iso-spectrality of the first pair (termed as GWW ) numerically by an ex-
trapolated mode-matching method. The “analytical” 9th and 21st modes there, corresponding
to known simple modes of the underlying triangles, were not only emphasized but were taken
at their exact values to 4-5 digits. Subsequently, Driscoll [30], using a much more accurate
modified domain-decomposition method [31], verified iso-spectrality to 12 significant digits for
the first 25 modes, including the two “analytical” modes. In 2005, the same or better accu-
racy was achieved by Betcke and Trefethen with a simple approach [32]. They modified the
famous method–Method of Particular Solutions [33], and revived it to calculate eigenvalues and
eigenmodes of the Laplacian in planar regions.
    On the experimental side, Sridhar and Kudrolli [29] performed measurements on thin mi-
crowave cavities shaped like GWW. The measured spectrum has subsequently been confirmed by
Wu’s numerical simulation [28]. Then Even and Pieranski [34] constructed actual shaped small
“drums”–membranes made from liquid crystal smectic films, and measured their vibrations. To
see earlier physical results, please refer [19, 20, 21] and references therein. More recently, Moon
et al. [36] utilized the iso-spectrality of the electronic nanostructures to extract the quantum
phase distributions. Interestingly, they checked that one could indeed “hear” iso-spectrality by
converting the average measured spectra into audio frequencies. For more details, please see the
movie caption in [36]. Later, phase extraction in disordered iso-spectral shapes was numerically


                                                2
emphasized in [37]. Furthermore, P. Amore [38] extended the iso-spectrality to a wider class of
physical problems, including the cases of heterogeneous drums and of quantum billiards in an
external field.
    The most basic known planar iso-spectral domains (GWW) are nine-sided polygons that
have also been termed as Bilby and Hawk [35]. Each is a polyform composed of seven identical
triangles and created via a specific series of reflections, such that every triangle is the mirror
image of its neighbors. Actually, they are a simplified version of the pair 73 . Previously based
on the reflection rule of 73 , Cox [40] constructed three dimensional iso-spectral domains. In
addition, 45 shapes assembled by unit cube, square-based prism and right-angled wedge were
depicted to show non-isospectrality in Moorhead’s Ph.D. thesis [39]. While the GWW solid iso-
spectral prisms (please also see [37]) take the equal eigenvalues, they are just constructed from
GWW by sweeping the face into a third orthogonal direction for the same distance. We revisit
the serials of reflection rule inherent in the 17 families of iso-spectral domains, and visualize
the rule in color red-blue-black. Figure 1 depicts the specific shape in 2D case. In accordance
with the reflection rule, we successfully construct real 3D iso-spectral models assembled by
seven tetrahedrons. The eigenfunctions of our 3D models are not only transplantable, but also
numerically equal .
    In Section 2 we will study the transplantation method that guarantees the isospectrality
of the 17 planar pairs. In Section 3 we show how to construct the iso-spectral models in 3D
space. In Section 4 we present some visualized 3D pairs which are iso-spectral and non-isometric.
Finally, conclusion remark briefly shows that the extension of constructing iso-spectral pairs can
also be used in higher dimensions.

Figure 1. 17 families of iso-spectral pairs constructed by Buser et al. [16]. The gallery of examples
represents not a single pair of iso-spectral domains, but a whole family of pairs of iso-spectral domains,
gotten by replacing the equilateral triangles with general triangles. It is not the shape of basic building
block, but the series of reflection which is important. The mirror reflection rule is visualized in color
red-blue-black. The yellow edge means the overlapped boundary edge. For more special properties (e.g.
overlapping, isometric), see the appendix in review [27].


   The classifications are illustrated below:

   • 7 tiles with 3 pairs: 71 , 72 , 73 ;

   • 13 tiles with 9 pairs: 131 , 132 , · · · , 139 ;

   • 15 tiles with 4 pairs: 151 , 152 , 153 , 154 ;

   • 21 tiles with 1 pairs: 211 .

2     Transplantation method
The transplantation proof was first applied to Riemann surfaces by Buser [11], and to reexamine
iso-spectrality of planar domains given in [16]. Quoting sentence from Buser “We shall show that
the eigenfunctions on the first surface can be suitable transplanted to yield eigenfunctions with
the same eigenvalue on the second surface and vice-versa”, we know suitable transplantation is
important. Bérard [15] followed this versatile method to reproof the iso-spectrality of the pair
constructed by Gordon et al.. Okada and Shudo [18] formalised the matrix representation (i.e.
transplantation matrix T ) of transplantation of eigenfunctions. In fact, it turns out that the
matrix T is just the incidence matrix of the graph associated with a certain finite projective
space [25] [26]. Giraud and Thas [27] reviewed the fascinating relation between the iso-spectral
pairs and geometry of vector spaces over finite fields. Illustrating one simple method to obtain
transplantation matrix of the 17 pairs, we follow the definition mentioned in [18, 25, 26, 27],
and describe it with red-blue-black reflection rule.




Figure 2. The special pair of 211 : termed as Aye-Aye and Beluga [36]. Each is a polyform composed
of 21 identical triangles with angles (30o , 60o , 90o ), and created via a specific series of mirror reflections
(e.g. basic tile labeled 1 is mirrored to tile 2 by red side). The labels can be arbitrary, for convenience,
we keep them consistent with the labels in [36].



Definition 2.1. The transplantation matrix T must be such that

                            T Aν = B ν T, ν = 1 (red), 2 (blue), 3 (black).                                (2.1)

In Equation (2.1), matrices Aν and B ν describe how the tiles are glued togethers (i.e. reflection
rule). For example,

    • Aνi,j = 1 if and only if the edge number (color) ν of i glues tile i to tile j;

    • Aνi,i = −1 if the edge number ν of i glues nothing (boundary);

    • 0, otherwise.

    For special pair of 211 depicted in Figure 2 , ν runs form 1 to 3 (red to black). That is also
alternatively corresponding with middle, long and short edge. If you keep the labels of Aye-Aye
and Beluga shape, line i contains a 1 at the column j where i and j are glued by their red
side; Otherwise the red side is the boundary of the tile, line i contains a -1. So for the red side,
the matrix A1 (associated with the Aye-Aye shape) would be that A11,2 = 1, A12,1 = 1, A13,3 =
−1, A14,5 = 1, A15,4 = 1 and so on. Similarly the B 1 matrix would be associate with the Beluga

non-isometric with (30o , 60o , 90o ) triangle as the basic tile. Sleeman and Hua [24] utilized it to construct
iso-spectral domains with fractal border. (C) This pair (GWW) is the paradigmatic pair constructed by
Gordon et al.

A and B for the three sides, finding T just amounts to solving a system of equation. If we
keep the notations that T := {Cij }N ×N (N represents 7, 13, 15, 21), combining reflection rule
in Figure 3 with definition 2.1, T can be calculated in the following form:

                                                                         C11     C13

                                                                                      .                   (2.2)
                        C13 −C11              C13 −C11 −C11             C13     C13 
                                                                                     
                        −C11 C11             −C11 C13  C13              −C13    −C13 
                         −C13 C13             −C11 C11  C13              −C11    −C13

C11 and C13 are the two remaining degrees of freedom after solving Equations (2.1). Extracting
C11 and C13 from Equation (2.2), hence T is simplified like this

                                     T = C11 T3 + C13 T4 , C11 6= C13 .                                    (2.3)

Tk has only k nonzero entries in each row and each column. In Buser’s words [16], T3 is the
original mapping while T4 is the complementary mapping. Any linear combination like Equation
(2.3) will also be a transplantation mapping. Once C11 is equal to C13 , there will be the nodal line
case (i.e. eigenfunctions will vanish, see book [41] for the explaination), in which the “analytical”
solutions appear.
    One can show that transplantation is a sufficient condition to guarantee iso-spectrality (if
the matrix T is not merely a permutation matrix, in which case the two domains would just
have the same shape). The underlying idea is that if φ is an eigenfunction of the first domain




                                                       6
and φi its restriction to tile i, then one can build an eigenfunction ϕ of the second domain as
                                          N
                                          X
                                ϕi = C          Tij φj , i = 1, 2, . . . , N.                  (2.4)
                                          j=1

C is some normalization factor in Equation (2.4). The smoothness of ϕi can be easily checked on
all reflecting sides and zero boundary conditions of the second domain, if the above conditions
are satisfied. Following this procedure, the two domains discussed will then be iso-spectral, since
the same map transposing eigenfunctions of the second domain onto the first domain will work
as before. For more mathematical proof, please see pp. 8 in review [27]. Simultaneously, you
can also refer Chapman’s paper-folding for the visualization of transplantation.
    As previously described, it is not even necessary for the basic tile to be a triangle. Arbitrary
shape with at least three edges will work. We simply choose a triangle with three sides to
represent the three edges, on which we will reflect the shape. Experiments drawn on frames of
arbitrary shapes were conducted by Even and Pieranski [34] using vibrations of smectic films.
Meanwhile, two series of reflections generating from 73 were highly emphasized. Taking the
words of Even and Pieranski, If one broke the reflection rule, the consequences on the spectrum
are drastic. Moon et al. [27] also designed one “Broken Hawk” violating the rule, which led
significantly difference compared with the spectrum of Bilby and Hawk. In summary, specific
reflection rules inherent in the 17 iso-spectral pairs are very important, when associating with
transplantation matrix to transplant eigenfunctions. Although this theorem considers the 2D
case only, the 3D case is similar.
    With notations α and β meaning formal parameters, the calculating results of transplantation
matrix for 17 iso-spectral pairs are given below:

    • 7 tiles: T = αT3 + βT4 , α 6= β;

    • 13 tiles: T = αT4 + βT9 , α 6= β;

    • 15 tiles: T = αT7 + βT8 , α 6= β;

    • 21 tiles: T = αT5 + βT16 , α 6= β.

Remark 2.2. It is easy to obtain similar relations for Neumann boundary conditions by con-
jugating all matrices Aν and B ν in definition 2.1, with a diagonal entry Aνi,i = 1 according to
whether tile i glues nothing (boundary).


3     How to construct the 3D iso-spectral models
In this section, we explain the idea of constructing iso-spectral pairs in 3D space, which also
can be seen as a real extension of the 2D pairs. There are a number of options for selecting
basic tile in 3D space, such as parallelepiped, tetrahedron, etc. Once you have selected the
basic tile (tetrahedron for example), you only need to fix one of its faces (meaning that you just
forget about it) and color the three other faces by red, blue and black. Then you do the mirror
reflection with respect to red, blue and black according to the rule. That will automatically
generate many 3D iso-spectral pairs.

3.1    Extensions of 71 for instance
    In order to facilitate the description of this extension, we first discuss the propeller-shaped
example [16], generated from the 71 pair. In both propellers the central triangle labelled “0” has
a distinguishing property: its sides connect the three inward corners of the propeller. Based on
this property, we choose one basic tetrahedron placing the position “0” of Figure 4. Following


                                                      7
the same orientation, we only need to perform the series of reflections rule depicted in Figure 4.
It is remarked that the biggest difference between 2D and 3D is that 2D is reflected by edges,
while 3D is reflected by faces. The following steps describe how to build up 3D iso-spectral
models.




Figure 4. The propeller and warped propeller iso-spectral pairs. The latter is gotten by replacing the
equilateral triangles with (45o , 60o , 75o ) triangles so that the triangles labelled 0 are mapped onto one
another by a translation. The remaining triangles are obtained from these by the appropriate sequence
of reflections, with the indication of the arrows. For convenience, each vertex of the triangle is labelled,
such as Q0 , Q1 , etc.



   • Step 1: Given four 3D vertices to form a basic tetrahedron tile {P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 }.
     P0 = (x0 , y0 , z0 ), P1 = (x1 , y1 , z1 ), P2 = (x2 , y2 , z2 ), P3 = (x3 , y3 , z3 ).

   • Step 2: Given 3D face (P1 , P2 , P3 ), for a point P0 , its mirror reflection mapping can be
     expressed as Q0 = Mirror(P0 ; P1 , P2 , P3 ). The relevant calculation formulas are
                                Q0 = P0 + 2Q0 P, Q0 P = α1 P1 + α2 P2 + α3 P3 ,                                (3.1)
       where Q0 P is the projection point of P0 on the face with three constrains
          (Q0 P − P0 ) · (P2 − P1 ) = 0,        (Q0 P − P0 ) · (P2 − P3 ) = 0,            α1 + α2 + α3 = 1.    (3.2)

   • Step 3: Fix or forget one 3D face (e.g. (P0 , P1 , P2 )). Then we can obtain the other two
     reflection points Q1 and Q2 with respect to faces (P0 , P2 , P3 ) and (P0 , P1 , P3 ).
                      Q1 = Mirror(P1 ; P0 , P2 , P3 ),              Q2 = Mirror(P2 ; P0 , P1 , P3 ).

    So far, four tetrahedrons assembled in our 3D model are as follows.
             {P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 },   {Q0 , P1 , P2 , P3 },       {P0 , Q1 , P2 , P3 }, {P0 , P1 , Q2 , P3 }.
They are all glued by “colored” faces. With further multilevel mirror operation, the next step
is to construct two models by adding three tetrahedrons in two different ways (Class 71 for
example).
   • Class 71 #A: {Q0 , Q0 P1 , P2 , P3 }, {P0 , Q1 , Q1 P2 , P3 }, {Q2 P0 , P1 , Q2 , P3 };
      Q0 P1 = Mirror(P1 ; Q0 , P2 , P3 ), Q1 P2 = Mirror(P2 ; P0 , Q1 , P3 ), Q2 P0 = Mirror(P0 ; P1 , Q2 , P3 ).

   • Class 71 #B: {Q0 , P1 , Q0 P2 , P3 }, {Q1 P0 , Q1 , P2 , P3 }, {P0 , Q2 P1 , Q2 , P3 };
      Q0 P2 = Mirror(P2 ; Q0 , P1 , P3 ), Q1 P0 = Mirror(P0 ; Q1 , P2 , P3 ), Q2 P1 = Mirror(P1 ; P0 , Q2 , P3 ).

Remark 3.1. Sometimes, there will be isometric models in 3D space. In Appendix, we present
3D models constructed by seven unit cubes. Because of the symmetry in unit cube, the models
in Figure 16 and 17 are isometric. Okada and Shudo [18] demonstrated that in 2D case, if
one destructs the symmetry by changing the shape of the building block, such an “accidental”
situation can be avoided. That is also useful in 3D case.

3.2    Extensions of 72 , 73 for instance
Here, following the arrows’ indications depicted in Figure 5, we can easily construct 3D iso-
spectral models as an extension of 72 . We choose the basic tetrahedron to replae the position
“0” of Figure 5, and perform the reflection rule continuously. Figure 6 depicts the same situation
of 73 . The remaining tetrahedrons will be obtained with further multilevel mirror operation.
For the other 14 families of iso-spectral pairs, their extensions of constructing 3D models are
similar with 71 , 72 and 73 , so we omit it.




Figure 5. Two planar 72 iso-spectral pairs. The latter is gotten by replacing the equilateral triangles
with (30o , 70o , 80o ) triangles (once appeared in [30]) so that the triangles labelled 0 are mapped onto one
another by a translation. For convenience, each vertex of the triangle is labelled, such as Q0 , Q1 , etc.




Figure 6. Two planar 73 iso-spectral pairs. The latter is gotten by replacing the equilateral triangles
with (30o , 60o , 90o ) triangles (once appeared in [24, 36]) so that the triangles labelled 0 are mapped onto
one another by a translation. For convenience, each vertex of the triangle is labelled, such as Q0 , Q1 , etc.




4     3D examples—Basic Simplex Tetrahedron—Numerical tests
In this section, we shall present 3D iso-spectral models constructed by seven Basic Simplex
Tetrahedrons (0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ z ≤ 1). Numerical method finite difference is emphasized to verify
the iso-spectrality of the 3D models.

    • Step 1. Given four 3D vertices of the Basic Simplex with coordinate,
      P0 = {0, 0, 0}, P1 = {0, 0, 1}, P2 = {1, 0, 1}, P3 = {1, 1, 1};

    • Step 2. Find three mirror points,
      Q0 = {0, 0, 2}, Q1 = {1, 0, 0}, Q2 = {0, 1, 1};
    • Step 3. Illustrate the four tetrahedrons assembled,
         – Simplex 0: {P0 , P1 , P2 , P3 },   0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ z ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 1: {Q0 , P1 , P2 , P3 },   0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ 2 − z ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 2: {P0 , Q1 , P2 , P3 },   0 ≤ y ≤ z ≤ x ≤ 1;

Figure 7. Four Simplex Tetrahedrons assembled (termed as kernel Simplex), viewing from different an-
gles. Face (P0 , P1 , P2 ) is special colored to help us forget it when performing reflection rule. Consequently,
faces (Q0 , P1 , P2 ), (P0 , Q1 , P2 ) and (P0 , P1 , Q2 ) are not considered as reflection faces, either.


         – Simplex 3: {P0 , P1 , Q2 , P3 },      0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 1.

    As a foundation of constructing non-isometric 3D models, kernel Simplex (depicted in Fig.
7) plays quite an important role, especially for the extension of 71 , 72 and 73 . Following the
reflection rule, we just conduct the multilevel mirror operation on the kernel Simplex, which
is just adding some tetrahedrons. The following step is to classify two non-isometric models
generated from 71 .
    • Class 71 #A, three mirror points: Q0 P1 = {1, 0, 2}, Q1 P2 = {1, 1, 0}, Q2 P0 = {0, 0, 2}.
         – Simplex 4: {Q0 , Q0 P1 , P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ y ≤ 2 − z ≤ x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 5: {P0 , Q1 , Q1 P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 6: {Q2 P0 , P1 , Q2 , P3 },     0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 2 − z ≤ 1.

    • Class 71 #B, three mirror points: Q0 P2 = {0, 1, 1}, Q1 P0 = {2, 0, 0}, Q2 P1 = {0, 1, 0}.
         – Simplex 4: {Q0 , P1 , Q0 P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 2 − z ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 5: {Q1 P0 , Q1 , P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 2 − x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 6: {P0 , Q2 P1 , Q2 , P3 },     0 ≤ x ≤ z ≤ y ≤ 1.

The labels in each vertex help us to distinguish the tetrahedrons. The colored tetrahedrons means the
three added tetrahedrons on the Kernel Simplex. Because of the symmetry in Simplex Tetrahedron,
points Q0 and Q2 P0 coincide.

Remark 4.1. Figure 8 and 9 depict one 3D iso-spectral pair termed as Class 71 #A and Class
71 #B respectively. They are all assembled by seven Simplex Tetrahedrons in different ways.
Because of the symmetry in the Simplex Tetrahedron, faces (P1 , P3 , Q0 ) and (P1 , P3 , Q2 P0 )

coincide in Class 71 #A. Similarly, faces (P0 , P3 , Q2 ) and (P0 , P3 , Q0 P2 ) coincide in Class 71
#B. For this case, we should also consider these faces as the boundary face.

Remark 4.2. Class 71 #A and Class 71 #B are non-isometric. With the aid of the 3D Printing
technique, we obtain two models which are obviously non-congruent. Moreover, utilizing their
distance matrix (the matrix of distances between all vertices), we can also judge they are non-
isometric.

    In Moorhead’s Ph.D thesis [39], he present 45 shapes to discuss iso-spectrality, using a
simple finite difference scheme to calculate eigenvalues. We are also interested in applying finite
difference method to our 3D iso-spectral models. For more detailed results, please see Table 1.
That is if we let λk be the approximated k-th eigenvalue for the first Class 71 #A and µk be
the approximated k-th eigenvalue for the second Class 71 #B then

                 max |λk − µk | = 6.2528 × 10−13 ,             kλk − µk kL2 = 1.4503 × 10−12 .
               1≤k≤25

   The following step is to classify two non-isometric models generated from 72 . You can see
the 3D view in Figure 10 and 11.
   • Class 72 #A, three mirror points: Q2 P1 = {0, 1, 0}, Q1 P0 = {2, 0, 0}, [Q1 P0 ]P2 = {1, 1, 0}.
         – Simplex 4: {P0 , Q2 P1 , Q2 , P3 },     0 ≤ x ≤ z ≤ y ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 5: {Q1 P0 , Q1 , P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 2 − x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 6: {Q1 P0 , Q1 , [Q1 P0 ]P2 , P3 },        0 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ 2 − x ≤ 1.

   • Class 72 #B, three mirror points: Q0 P1 = {1, 0, 2}, Q1 P2 = {1, 1, 0}, [Q1 P2 ]P0 = {2, 0, 0}.
         – Simplex 4: {Q0 , Q0 P1 , P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ y ≤ 2 − z ≤ x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 5: {P0 , Q1 , Q1 P2 , P3 },     0 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ x ≤ 1;
         – Simplex 6: {[Q1 P2 ]P0 , Q1 , Q1 P2 , P3 },        0 ≤ z ≤ y ≤ 2 − x ≤ 1.

by sweeping the face into a third orthogonal direction for the same distance.

 Figure 13 depicts the 3D X-ray form of Class 73 #A and 73 #B. At the same time, we also
illustrate other 3D iso-spectral models constructed by Wall Tetrahedrons. Different from the

with coordinate:

We can calculate the mirror points according to Equation (3.1) and Equation (3.2). Figure 14
depicts the two 3D iso-spectral models.

Generated from 73 by fixing the face (P0 , P1 , P3 ), this pair is iso-spectral and non-isometric.


Remark 4.3. For Basic Simplex Tetrahedron (0 ≤ y ≤ x ≤ z ≤ 1) , there exists “analytical”
eigenmodes (please refer the explanation of the GWW’s eigenmodes in [30]). The first eigenmode
is expressed in Simplex Tetrahedron of (12 + 22 + 32 )π. The first approximated eigenmodes cal-
culated by finite difference method are marked in red color, see Table 1-3. Numerical techniques
are therefore employed to approximate such eigenvalues, but even this has its own problems
(e.g. the way to deal with reentrant corners).
Remark 4.4. Note that if the colors of faces are permuted the resulting 3D pairs also become
iso-spectral. For example, the pair 71 represents three distinguishable pairs of models for a fixed
tetrahedron.

5    Conclusion
Milnor’s work is not a direct answer to the original version of Kac’s question because it is
not concerned with the planar domains. But from Milnor’s example one learned that there
really exists non-congruent domains with the same eigenvalue spectrum. From a mathematical
point of view, the spectrum of a drum corresponds to the set of eigenvalues of the negative
Laplacian on a given planar domain, where the solutions vanish at the border (Dirichlet boundary
conditions). Sunada’s idea was to reduce the problem of finding iso-spectral manifolds to a group-
theoretical problem, namely, constructing triplets of groups having a certain property. Based on
the Sunada’s method, Buser et al. constructed 17 families of iso-spectral pairs, and confirmed
their iso-spectrality by the transplantation method. Giraud and Thas reviewed the highlighting
mathematical and physical aspects of iso-spectrality.
    We revisit the serials of reflection rule inherent in the 17 families of planar iso-spectral
domains. Following the reflection rule visualized by red-blue-black, many 3D iso-spectral models
can be constructed. Especially for the tetrahedron as the basic building block, we present some
visualized 3D pairs which are iso-spectral and non-isometric. This extension of constructing iso-
spectral pairs can also be used in higher dimensions, with transplantation method to guarantee
the respective iso-spectrality.

By the definition 2.1 in Section 2, we obtain all the commutation relations (permutation matrices
Aν and B ν ). Finding T just amounts to solving a system of Equation (2.1).

    Second,we present two isometric models generated from the Class 71 . They are constructed
by seven unit cubes depicted in Figure 16 and 17. The gaps between some cubes are to be
interpreted as having zero boundary.




Figure 15. One unit cube and four unit cubes assembled (termed as Kernel Unit Cube). The colors on
faces help us to perform mirror reflection operation.




Figure 16. Seven unit cubes assembled (generated from Class 71 #A), viewing in two angles. The colors
on faces help us to perform mirror reflection operation.




Figure 17. Seven unit cubes assembled (generated from Class 71 #B), viewing in two angles. The colors
on faces help us to perform mirror reflection operation.
