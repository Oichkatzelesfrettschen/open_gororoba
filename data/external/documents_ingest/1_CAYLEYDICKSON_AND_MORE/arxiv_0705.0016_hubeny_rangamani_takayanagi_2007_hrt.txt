                                                 With an aim towards understanding the time-dependence of entanglement entropy
                                             in generic quantum field theories, we propose a covariant generalization of the holo-
                                             graphic entanglement entropy proposal of hep-th/0603001. Apart from providing sev-
                                             eral examples of possible covariant generalizations, we study a particular construction
                                             based on light-sheets, motivated in similar spirit to the covariant entropy bound under-
                                             lying the holographic principle. In particular, we argue that the entanglement entropy
                                             associated with a specified region on the boundary in the context of the AdS/CFT
                                             correspondence is given by the area of a co-dimension two bulk surface with vanishing
                                             expansions of null geodesics. We demonstrate our construction with several exam-
                                             ples to illustrate its reduction to the holographic entanglement entropy proposal in
                                             static spacetimes. We further show how this proposal may be used to understand
                                             the time evolution of entanglement entropy in a time varying QFT state dual to a
                                             collapsing black hole background. Finally, we use our proposal to argue that the Eu-
                                             clidean wormhole geometries with multiple boundaries should be regarded as states in
                                             a non-interacting but entangled set of QFTs, one associated to each boundary.

1    Introduction

     One of the important questions in quantum field theories is to understand the number
of operative degrees of freedom in the theory at a given scale. In conventional RG parlance
this is measured by the Zamolodchikov’s c-function (in two dimensions) [1] which at the
critical points takes on the value of the central charge. One believes this picture to persist in
higher dimensions; in particular, there ought to exist some analog of a c-function in higher
dimensional quantum field theories of interest. Clearly there is a well-defined notion of the
central charges for conformal field theories in d > 2 [2], which may quantify the total degrees
of freedom. However, this interpretation in terms of the degrees of freedom has not yet been
rigorously proved except in two dimensions. Measuring degrees of freedom in time-dependent
backgrounds is an especially important open problem. A detailed understanding of this
issue is very important for making precise the notion of holography in quantum gravity. For
example, in the context of string theory in unstable backgrounds with closed string tachyons,
one expects that as the tachyon condenses, the number of degrees of freedom does change
[3]; to verify this expectation it is crucial to have a precise notion of the time-dependent
degrees of freedom.
    A simple way to get a measure of the degrees of freedom is to couple the system to a
heat bath and study its thermal properties, in particular its entropy. However, we could also
ask the equally important question: suppose we concentrate on a particular region of the
background spacetime on which the QFT is defined and ask what is the correct measure of
the operative degrees of freedom in that region (even at zero temperature). One important
aspect of this is captured by the entanglement entropy, which provides a measure of how the
degrees of freedom localized in that region interact (are “entangled”) with the rest of the
theory. In a sense the entanglement entropy is a measure of the effective operative degrees
of freedom, i.e., those that are active participants in the dynamics, in a given region of the
background geometry. Refer to [4] for a short review of entanglement entropy in QFT.
     Consider a QFT defined on a spacetime manifold ∂M (the peculiar choice of notation for
the background will become clear momentarily), and assume that ∂M allows the foliation
by time-slices ∂Nt as ∂M = ∂Nt × Rt . We wish to focus on a region At ⊂ ∂Nt at a fixed
time t. Denote also the complement of At with respect to ∂Nt by Bt so that At ∪ Bt = ∂Nt .
This procedure divides the Hilbert space for the total system H into a direct product of two
Hilbert spaces HA and HB for the two subsystems, corresponding to the regions At and Bt ,
respectively, i.e., Htot = HA ⊗ HB . In this setup, one measure of the number of degrees of
freedom associated with region (or sub-system) At is given by the entanglement entropy SAt .
It is defined as the von Neumann entropy SAt (t) = −Tr ρAt (t) log ρAt (t) associated with the
reduced density matrix ρAt (t) = TrB ρtot (t), obtained by taking a trace of the density matrix
ρtot (t) for the total system at time t over the Hilbert space HB . Notice that the entanglement
entropy defined in this way is manifestly time-dependent. Below, we will suppress the index
t which shows the time-dependence when we consider a static system, where SAt (t) does not


                                               3
depend on t.
     In the same way, we can define the entanglement entropy SBt (t) for the other subsystem
Bt . In general, SAt (t) is different from SBt (t). However, they are equivalent if the total system
is described by a pure state |Ψ(t)i =|ΨAt i ⊗ |ΨBt i, where the total and reduced density
matrices are given by ρtot (t) =|Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| and ρAt (t) = TrBt |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)|, respectively.
    In a two dimensional CFT, we can analytically calculate the entanglement entropy for
arbitrary choice of the subsystem At as shown recently in [5], generalizing the previously
known result [6]. Moreover, an analogue of the Zamolodchikov’s c-theorem (called entropic
c-theorem) has been shown in [7, 8] (see also [9]). However, in higher dimensions it is rather
difficult to obtain analytical results for generic At . Its state of the art is reviewed in [10]
from the viewpoint of the QFT.
    Recently, entanglement entropies of various 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensional condensed matter
systems have been actively investigated in order to understand zero temperature quantum
phase transitions [11, 4, 12, 13, 14]. In this context, entanglement entropy plays an important
role of an order parameter of the phase transition. For example, in a material exhibiting
topological ordering, such as the system with anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect,
correlation functions are not useful since the theory is topological. Instead we need a quantity
which probes non-local information like fractional statistics of anyons. It turns out that the
entanglement entropy can do this job elegantly, because it is defined non-locally [12, 13, 14].
    As already mentioned, one of the important reasons to be interested in issues related to
measuring degrees of freedom has to do with quantum gravity and the notion of holography.
Roughly speaking, the holographic principle states that the number of degrees of freedom
in a quantum theory of gravity scales with the area of the system, in contrast to standard
QFTs where the entropy is extensive and scales with the volume [15, 16, 17]. In string
theory a natural realization of the holographic principle is manifested by the AdS/CFT
correspondence [18, 19] which gives us a precise map between a quantum gravity theory on
an asymptotically AdS spacetime M and an ordinary QFT on the conformal boundary ∂M
of M. In this context we can ask whether there is a gravitational dual of the entanglement
entropy associated with a subsystem of the boundary QFT. Refer to [20, 21] for earlier
pioneering works.
   Interestingly, for a long time it has been known that the leading ultraviolet divergent
contribution to the entanglement entropy SA in QFTs is proportional to the area of the
boundary ∂A of the subsystem A (known as the area law of entanglement entropy) [22, 23].
This means that unlike the thermal entropy, the entanglement entropy is not an extensive
quantity.1 Instead, this property looks very analogous to the holographic principle and the
area law of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy. This fact strongly suggests a simple
   1
       For systems at finite temperature, the entanglement entropy also includes a finite extensive term which
is proportional to the thermal entropy.

gravitational interpretation of entanglement entropy in QFTs via a holographic relation.
    Recently, a geometric procedure has been discovered to compute the entanglement en-
tropy of a sub-system A ⊂ ∂N in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence [24, 10].
The construction which we review in § 2 proceeds as follows: given a region A in ∂N (at
a fixed time) of a static asymptotically AdS spacetime, we construct a minimal surface S
(i.e., a surface whose area takes the minimum value) in the bulk spacetime M which is
anchored at the boundary ∂A of A. The area of this minimal surface in the bulk Planck
units provides an accurate measure of the entanglement of the degrees of freedom in A with
those in its spatial complement, B. This prescription has been verified by several non-trivial
checks [24, 10, 25, 3, 26] as well as a direct proof [27]. This holographic prescription provides
a simple way to calculate the entanglement entropy in spacetimes with no temporal evo-
lution. Moreover, this holographic relation is successfully applied to the brane-world black
holes [28, 29] and de-Sitter spaces [30] as well, which enable us to interpret the horizon
entropy with quantum corrections as the entanglement entropy (see also recent discussions
[31, 32, 33]).
    The geometric perspective provided by the minimal surface construction has many ad-
vantages, especially for QFTs in dimensions d > 2, since there are relatively few techniques
to calculate the entanglement entropy in interacting field theories. Furthermore, herein lies
the hope to address an interesting question related to entanglement entropy, namely its be-
haviour as a function of time in an interacting QFT. In this context it is important to note
that since the entanglement entropy is not an extensive quantity, unlike the conventional
thermodynamic entropy, a priori it does not have to obey the Second Law. Nevertheless, it
seems natural to expect that when we consider an interacting QFT, the degrees of freedom
in region A will interact with those in B and consequently get more entangled, thereby in-
creasing the entanglement entropy SA . Indeed the following theorem is well-known: let Λt
(t ∈ R+ ) be a one parameter family of positive linear transformations of a Hilbert space H
such that they constitute a semi-group2 ; then S(Λt (ρ)) ≥ S(ρ). This “monotonicity” prop-
erty essentially comes from the concavity of −ρ log ρ as a function of ρ. In the setup of this
theorem, we interpret Λt as the irreversible and non-unitary time-evolution such as a quan-
tum analogue of the Markov process. Also ρ is taken to be the reduced density matrix ρA .
On the other hand, in the case of a unitary time evolution of an excited state, the entropy
for the total system remains the same while the entanglement entropy for a subsystem can
change. Explicit examples are borne out in the analysis of [34] where the authors analyse
the situation in two dimensional field theories. However, the general story is far from clear
and one would like to get a better handle on the problem. Hence, instead of examining
time-dependence of entanglement entropy from the QFT point of view, we would like to
   2
       Here a positive matrix is defined to be a Hermitian matrix whose trace is positive. A positive linear
transformation is the one which maps a positive matrix to another positive matrix. Also we require that it
does not change the identity and satisfies Tr Λt (ρ) = Tr ρ for any density matrix on H.



                                                      5
analyse it using the holographic prescription mentioned above.
    In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the prescription for calculating the en-
tanglement entropy from the area of a minimal surface suffers from one stumbling block: the
minimal surfaces are usually associated with Euclidean geometries. In Lorentzian spacetimes
one has trouble defining a minimal surface, because by wiggling a spacelike surface in the
time direction, one can make its area arbitrarily small. For static spacetimes, this problem
is usually avoided by Wick rotating and working in the Euclidean set-up, or equivalently by
restricting attention to a constant time slice. But for the most interesting, dynamical ques-
tions, this method is not applicable. However, this does not necessarily mean that the notion
of the geometric dual of the entanglement entropy cannot be defined in general. Indeed, as
we have explicitly seen, entanglement entropy is well-defined in terms of the time-dependent
density matrix, and therefore has to admit a well-defined holographic dual. By well-defined
we mean generally covariant. Hence, our strategy for examining the entanglement entropy
dual in a general time-dependent scenario will be to first find a suitable fully covariant
generalization of the minimal-surface proposal, and then to use this ‘covariant holographic
entanglement entropy’ definition3 to find the time-variation in the specific cases of interest.
    To motivate the possibility of generalizing the dual of entanglement entropy in time-
dependent scenarios, it is useful to think of the analogy with a spacelike geodesic (which
in fact describes the minimal surface for a 3-dimensional bulk). In Euclidean spacetimes,
spacelike geodesics are local minima of the proper length functional. However, in Lorentzian
spacetimes they are extrema of the proper length. Likewise, we expect that the natural
analog of the Euclidean minimal surface to be an extremal surface, denoted by W below,
which is a saddle point of the proper area functional. This expectation is indeed realized,
and forms the primary result of this paper.
    For stationary bulk geometries with a timelike Killing field, the entanglement entropy is
likewise time independent, and there exists a canonical foliation of the bulk spacetime M by
spacelike surfaces. In a generic time-dependent background there is no preferred canonical
foliation in the bulk. In contrast, for a QFT on a fixed background we do have a natural
notion of time. The issue from a gravitational standpoint is then whether a given spacelike
                     Q
foliation in ∂M = t ∂Nt × Rt , extends in a unique fashion into the bulk to provide us
with the requisite foliation of M. If the answer is in the affirmative, then we can use the
spacelike slices thus constructed and find minimal surfaces localized within them.
    Indeed, even in time-dependent geometries it is plausible that there is a natural slicing
of the bulk spacetime M: we can define “maximal area” co-dimension one spacelike slices
Σ, by the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature on Σ. Since each Σ is spacelike, we
  3
      In what follows, to simplify the terminology somewhat, we will sometimes denote this as simply “co-
variant entanglement entropy”; it should be clear from context when we mean the gravitational dual and
when we are talking about the QFT quantity.



                                                    6
now have a well-defined prescription for finding a minimal-area (bulk co-dimension two)
surface localized within Σ and anchored at ∂A. We denote this ‘minimal surface on maximal
slice’ by X . The surface X is covariantly defined, and like W it reduces correctly to the
requisite minimal surface for static spacetimes, thereby providing another candidate for the
covariant entanglement entropy. However, as we will see, to make contact with a holographic
perspective we will have to elevate the notion of the maximal slice to that of a totally geodesic
co-dimension one slice.
    In this paper we examine the two constructions W and X motivated above, and propose
a more appealing covariant generalization Y of the geometric construction of [24, 10] to
compute entanglement entropy in general asymptotically AdS spacetimes. The basic idea
behind our proposal is to exploit the light-sheet construction of the covariant entropy bounds
of Bousso [35, 36, 37]. Light-sheets are a natural concept in Lorentzian spacetimes and serve
to single out a co-dimension two spacelike surface of the bulk manifold whose area bounds the
entropy passing through its light-sheet in the context of the covariant entropy bounds. We
will denote this surface, whose construction we focus on in what follows, by Y. The minimal
surface X construction also singles out a co-dimension two spacelike surface, albeit by first
picking a spacelike foliation and then finding a co-dimension one surface within the leaves of
the foliation. It is thus natural to expect that there is an intimate relation between the light-
sheet construction and minimal surfaces and indeed we will show that they are equivalent if
a given time slice is totally geodesic. We hope a similar argument can be applied to more
general spacetimes with boundaries allowing bulk non-trivial minimal surfaces.
    A natural way to motivate the light-sheet construction is to consider a cut-off field theory
in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. The dual description of the bulk is then in terms of a cut-
off field theory coupled to dynamical gravity on the cut-off surface. Due to the gravitational
dynamics in the boundary field theory the entropy associated with any co-dimension two
surface bounds the amount of information that passes through the light-sheet associated
with that surface. The spacelike co-dimension two surface can be taken to be the boundary
∂A of the subsystem A. Aided by this construction we can extend the light-sheets that live
on the cut-off surface into bulk light-sheets and ask what is the spacelike surface in the bulk
associated with these? Imposing the constraint that the spacelike co-dimension two4 surface
in M be required to have boundary ∂A on ∂M so that light-sheets can end on it, we can
find the bulk surface we were looking for.
    While this motivates the proposal for a covariantization of the geometric prescription
for finding the entanglement entropy in terms of light-sheets in this formulation, it is not
very constructive. There is in fact a simple algorithm for actually constructing the bulk
surface Y in question: find the spacelike co-dimension two surface whose boundary coincides
   4
       Note that co-dimension two surface in the cut-off boundary corresponds to a co-dimension three surface
in the full bulk; so here the requisite surface has the same dimension as A rather than ∂A – see Table 1 in
Appendix A.


                                                       7
with ∂A on ∂M with the constraint that the trace of the null extrinsic curvatures (i.e. the
null expansions) associated with the two null normals to Y vanish. For smooth surfaces
parameterized by two functions this leads in general to some partial differential equations
which can be solved to obtain a precise construction of the surface. Furthermore, we can
show that this definition of Y is actually equivalent to the requirement that Y is the co-
dimension two extremal surface in the Lorentzian manifold with the specified boundary
condition. In other words, Y = W. Thus this construction naturally reduces to the minimal
surface prescription of [24, 10].
    As a check in a simple non-static example, we analytically compute the holographic en-
tanglement entropy of three dimensional rotating (BTZ) black holes employing our covariant
prescription. The result precisely agrees with the entropy calculated in the dual two dimen-
sional CFT. Furthermore, we also argue that the prescription of finding the surface Y using
the vanishing null extrinsic curvatures can be derived from a bulk-boundary relation a la.,
GKP-W relation [38, 39] for the AdS/CFT correspondence. One can set up a variational
problem by exploiting these ideas and show that the action principle in gravity singles out
the extremal surface.
    Once we have a covariant prescription for computing the Lorentzian extremal surface
in M we can ask the basic questions that motivated the investigation in the first place,
such as whether the entanglement entropy has definite monotonicity properties vis a vis
temporal evolution. To address this issue we discuss the example of a spacetime background
involving a collapse scenario leading to black hole formation; the spacetime is modeled by
a Vaidya-AdS spacetime. Due to the formation of a black hole in the bulk, we expect that
the dual field theory on the boundary thermalizes. The thermalization is expected to lead
to an increase in the entanglement entropy: the ergodic mixing of the boundary degrees of
freedom would suggest that the degrees of freedom localized in region A interact more with
those in B and thereby one expects that the entanglement entropy grows in time. The bulk
computation using the light-sheet prescription bears out this picture nicely.
    Another example where a covariant formulation is necessary is the case of wormhole
spacetimes in AdS with two disconnected boundaries [40]. Even though the two CFTs on
the two disconnected boundaries look decoupled from each other, there are non-vanishing
correlation functions between two theories in the dual gravity calculation as pointed out
in [40]. We would like to present a possible resolution to this puzzle by computing the
entanglement entropy between the two CFTs.
    The outline of the paper is as follows: we begin in § 2 with a quick review of the minimal
surface proposal for static spacetimes and the reasons to expect a covariant generalization
of this picture. We then proceed in § 3 to motivate the light-sheet construction for time-
dependent backgrounds. We present a manifestly covariant holographic entanglement en-
tropy in this section, which is the most important conclusion of this paper. We explain how
this construction can be naturally motivated from a variational principle and its connection


                                              8
to the bulk-boundary relation within the AdS/CFT context in § 4. In § 5 we illustrate the
calculations of the entanglement entropy using our covariant proposal and demonstrate the
consistent agreement with the minimal surface prescription of [24, 10]. We also examine
rotating BTZ black holes, which are stationary but non-static, and show that our covariant
proposal precisely reproduces the entanglement entropy computed from the CFT side. In § 6
we discuss the explicit time-dependent situation of gravitational collapse and argue that the
entanglement entropy increases monotonically in this context. We discuss other interesting
time-dependent backgrounds, such as AdS wormholes and bubbles of nothing in § 7 and end
with a discussion in § 8. In Appendix A we present a simpler covariant construction which
whilst not reproducing the correct minimal surface in general is nevertheless interesting in
that it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy. In Appendix B we give a proof of
equivalence between the vanishing of null expansions and the extremal surface. In Appendix
C we presents some details of the calculations of the time-dependent entanglement entropy
in the Vaidya-AdS background using perturbative methods.



2     Entanglement entropy and time-dependent QFTs

As mentioned in the Introduction, our main aim is to find a covariant prescription for calcu-
lating the entanglement entropy associated with a given region of the boundary conformal
field theory. We begin by reviewing the minimal surface proposal of [24, 10], which pro-
vides the first step of geometrization of entanglement entropy in the AdS/CFT context, and
which will serve to set up the background and notation for the subsequent generalization
to non-stationary spacetimes. We then argue that entanglement entropy remains a well-
defined concept in time-varying states in the field theory, and motivate a correspondingly
well-defined dual geometric construction which would accommodate any time-dependence in
the bulk. Finally, we remark that there are in fact many such plausible constructions, and
give an overview of those we focus on in the present paper.


2.1   Review of holographic entanglement entropy

Consider a d + 1 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime M with conformal boundary
∂M. For the present we will concentrate on the static case when M admits a timelike
                ∂ µ
                 
Killing field ∂t    . On the boundary ∂M of M, which serves as the background for the
                                                         ∂ µ
                                                           
dual field theory, time translations are generated by ∂t      which is simply the pullback of
the bulk Killing field. Thus we can naturally foliate the boundary ∂M by spacelike surfaces
                                                               Q
which are normal to this timelike Killing field so that ∂M = t ∂Nt × Rt . Consider then a
particular leaf ∂N of this foliation which we wish to divide into into two regions A and B so
that ∂N = A ∪ B. The boundary between these regions is denoted as ∂A(= ∂B) assuming
that ∂N is a compact manifold. Note that A is (d − 1)-dimensional and ∂A is therefore

                                             9
(d − 2)-dimensional.
    For a QFT on ∂M we can calculate the entanglement entropy associated with the region
A. Since there are infinitely many degrees of freedom in an ordinary QFT, it is known that
the entanglement entropy suffers from an ultraviolet divergence. The standard result is that
the leading divergence of entanglement entropy scales as the area of the boundary ∂A between
the two regions (or sub-systems, as they are conventionally referred to in the entanglement
entropy literature) [22, 23]. The intuitive reason of this area law for the divergent part is
that the most entangled degrees of freedom are the high energy ones localized within an
infinitesimal neighbourhood of ∂A. Essentially,
                                        Area(∂A)
                                  SA = α          +··· ,                               (2.1)
                                           εd−2
where we have indicated the leading divergent behaviour (α is a constant factor). The
infinitesimally small parameter ε denotes the ultraviolet divergence (i.e. lattice spacing).
The subleading terms contain slower power law or logarithmic divergences apart from finite
terms which are of interest.
    Since we work within the AdS/CFT context we can ask whether the entanglement entropy
for the boundary QFT can be calculated using a purely geometric construction in the bulk;
this question was answered in the affirmative in [24, 10]. The essential idea behind the
picture of [24, 10] is the following: by virtue of time translation invariance, the boundary
spacelike foliation naturally extends into the bulk to provide a canonical spacelike foliation
Q
  t Nt of M. On a given spacelike slice in the M we are instructed to construct a minimal
(area) surface which ends on ∂A ⊂ ∂N . This is a well defined problem and the minimal
surface which is a spacelike surface of vanishing mean curvature is guaranteed to exist due
to the Euclidean signature of the bulk spacelike slice. Thus, given the minimal surface Smin ,
the entanglement entropy associated with region A is
                                            Area(Smin )
                                     SA =          (d+1)
                                                           .                              (2.2)
                                             4 GN
Note that the minimal surface S is a co-dimension two surface in the bulk spacetime M by
virtue of being a co-dimension one submanifold of a particular leaf of the spacelike foliation.


2.2   Entanglement entropy in time-dependent states in QFT

For states in QFT with trivial time-dependence, one can calculate the entanglement entropy
in a conventional manner by looking at the decomposition of the total Hilbert space on a
given time-slice. The holographic perspective of this is captured by the minimal surface pre-
scription indicated in (2.2). It is clear from the outset that in QFT nothing prevents us from
considering explicitly time-varying states and computing entanglement entropy for subsys-
tems thereof. It is easy to give a path-integral prescription for computing the entanglement
entropy in these circumstances and we outline the basic methodology below.

                                              10
    Consider a quantum field theory in a time-dependent background. Its evolution in time
is described by the time-dependent Hamiltonian H(t). A state at the time t = t1 is defined
by |Ψ(t1 )i. It is related to the state at the time t0 via the familiar formula
                                              Z t1          
                            |Ψ(t1 )i = T exp −i       dt H(t) |Ψ(t0 )i .             (2.3)
                                                              t0


   In the path integral formulation, the ket state |Ψ(t1 )i is equivalently constructed by the
path-integral5 from t = −∞ to t = t1
                                     Z t=t1
                   Ψ (t1 , φ0 (x)) =        [Dφ] eiS(φ) δ (φ(t1 , x) − φ0 (x)) ,         (2.4)
                                                t=−∞

where we represent all fields by φ. On the other hand, the bra state hΨ(t1 )| is expressed as
follows:                           Z t=∞
                           Ψ (t1 , φ0 (x)) =           [Dφ] eiS(φ) δ (φ(t1 , x) − φ0 (x)) .            (2.5)
                                                t=t1

Clearly they satisfy
                          ∂                                         ∂
                      i      |Ψ(t)i = H(t) |Ψ(t)i ,             i      hΨ(t)|= −hΨ(t)| H(t) .          (2.6)
                          ∂t                                        ∂t

    Let us first assume the total system is described by a pure state |Ψ(t)i with unit norm
at vanishing temperature. Then the total density matrix is given by

                                               ρtot (t) = |Ψ(t)ihΨ(t)| ,                               (2.7)

and its time-evolution is dictated by the von-Neumann equation
                                               ∂ρtot (t)
                                          i              = [H(t), ρtot (t)] .                          (2.8)
                                                 ∂t
In the gravitational context we will consider interesting examples with event horizons. These
will be described in the dual CFT by a mixed state and so we need to formulate the theory
by using only the density matrix ρtot (t). However, even in such cases we expect to have
an equivalent description in terms of a pure state by assuming another CFT sector hidden
inside the horizons as in the Schwarzschild-AdS case [21], or other degrees of freedom in
more general circumstances as in the examples of [41]. Thus the assumption (2.7) does not
exclude the choice of density matrices, so long as we can purify the state by passage to a
enlarged Hilbert space (which, in the geometry, corresponds to another sector behind the
horizon).
   Divide the total Hilbert space into a direct product of two Hilbert spaces at time t:
Htot = HA ⊗ HB . In the quantum field theory, this is realized by dividing the total space
   5
       By employing the conventional i ǫ – prescription we can project the asymptotic state |Ψ(t = ∞)i to the
ground state.

                                                           11
manifold ∂N at a fixed time into two parts A and B. Then the entanglement entropy SA (t)
at time t is defined as follows

                                SA (t) = −TrA (ρA (t) log ρA (t)) ,                          (2.9)

where ρA (t) is the reduced density matrix

                           ρA (t) = TrB ρtot (t) = TrB |Ψ(t)i hΨ(t)| .                      (2.10)

We always normalize any (reduced) density matrices ρ such that their trace is one i.e.,
Tr ρ = 1. In order to express SA (t) in the path integral formalism, we need to first describe
the reduced density matrix in that formalism (see also [5, 34, 42, 10]). Taking the trace in
the Hilbert space HB in (2.10) is equivalent to partially gluing two boundaries in (2.4) and
(2.5) along B. Thus it is described by the path-integral over the whole spacetime with an
infinitesimally small slit along A at a fixed time t
                       Z t=∞
                  1                       Y
  [ρA (t)]φ+ φ− =    ·        [Dφ] eiS(φ)     δ (φ(t + ǫ, x) − φ+ (x)) δ (φ(t − ǫ, x) − φ− (x)) ,
                  Z1 t=−∞                 x∈A
                                                                                             (2.11)
where ǫ is an infinitesimal positive constant and we also defined
                                           Z t=∞
                                    Z1 =          [Dφ] eiS(φ) .                              (2.12)
                                              t=−∞

Given the definition of the trace of the density matrix ρA in (2.11), it is easy to calculate
the trace Tr(ρA )n . This is calculated by integrating the products of path-integrals

                         [ρA (t)]φ1+ φ1− [ρA (t)]φ2+ φ2− · · · [ρA (t)]φn+ φn− ,            (2.13)

successively with the identifications: φ1− = φ2+ , φ2− = φ3+ , · · · and φn− = φ1+ . In other
words, this is essentially the partition function Zn (t) on the (singular) manifold ∂Mn which
is defined by the n copies of the total manifold M glued along A at the fixed time t
                                                        Zn (t)
                                       Tr (ρA (t))n =          .                            (2.14)
                                                        (Z1 )n
Knowledge of the partition function Zn (t) on the singular manifold, then allows us to compute
the entanglement entropy using:
                               ∂                                 ∂ log Zn (t)
                 SA (t) = −      log Tr (ρA (t))n     = log Z1 −                  .         (2.15)
                              ∂n                  n=1                ∂n       n=1


2.3   Towards holographic entanglement entropy in time-dependent states

The discussion of entanglement entropy in time-dependent QFT states in the previous section
makes it clear that there is no a priori obstruction in thinking about this issue from a field

                                                   12
theoretic perspective. In the AdS/CFT context we would then like to ask whether the
holographic entanglement entropy proposal of [24, 10] can be generalized to time-dependent
scenarios. In particular, can we find a suitable generalization of the minimal surface which
is fully covariant? The answer is of course yes, and in fact we will propose several covariant
constructions in this and the next section, and examine the relations between them.
    To motivate the existence of a suitable covariantly well-defined surface, we start6 by
indicating the construction of the surface which we will denote as X , which is the most naive
generalization of the minimal surface in the case of static bulk spacetimes. Consider a time-
dependent version of the AdS/CFT correspondence where the boundary theory is taken to
be in a time-varying state on a fixed background ∂M. The corresponding bulk geometry M
will have an explicit time-dependence and hence no timelike Killing field. Since the metric
on ∂M is non-dynamical in the boundary, we can choose a foliation by equal time slices,
by picking our time coordinate such that it implements the natural Hamiltonian evolution
of the field theory, so that ∂M = ∂Nt × Rt . We can choose to consider a region At ∈ ∂Nt
on a given time slice as in § 2.2 and compute the entanglement entropy using the path
integral prescription. The question then is what is the analog of this computation from a
bulk perspective?
   Naively, one would expect that the minimal surface prescription for computing the holo-
graphic entanglement entropy should go through. However, this cannot quite be the case;
as mentioned in § 1, in Lorentzian spacetimes one has to be careful about defining suitable
minimal area surfaces due to the indefinite metric signature.
    The crucial issue in a Lorentzian setting is the fact that generically, the equal-time
foliation on the boundary ∂M does not necessarily lead to a canonical (i.e., symmetry-
motivated) foliation of the bulk M. Supposing for the moment that a natural foliation was
singled out; we could then compute the holographic entanglement entropy by first picking the
preferred spacelike slice Nt of M given by extending the slice from ∂M. On Nt the induced
metric is spacelike and the notion of the minimal surface is well defined. The holographic
prescription then amounts to finding a minimal surface S ∈ N such that ∂S|∂M = ∂A.
    The above observation suggests that we look for a covariantly defined spacelike slice
of the bulk, Nt , anchored at ∂Nt , which reduces to the constant-t slice for static bulk.
Generically, while one expects no preferred/natural time slicing of M, it is plausible that
for asymptotically AdS spacetimes one has a preferred foliation by zero7 mean curvature
slices i.e., slices with vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature. Physically, each of these slices
corresponds to the maximal area spacelike slice through the bulk, anchored at the boundary
   6
       Those readers who would like to know the final conclusion immediately are advised to skip to the
covariant entanglement entropy proposal (I) and (II) in § 3.1 and § 3.3.
   7
     In general, any constant mean curvature slice of the bulk provides a covariantly well-defined surface;
however, when this constant is non-zero it doesn’t satisfy the requirement of reducing to the constant-t slice
in static bulk.


                                                     13
slice ∂N .8 We denote the leaves of this maximal-area foliation by Σt .
    One might worry that the maximal-area slice is not well defined because an area of a
given surface can always be increased by “crumpling” or wiggling the surface in the spatial
directions; however, here the crucial point is that our slice has co-dimension one, extending
over all the available spatial directions, and therefore allows no room for wiggling. An-
other possible concern is the fact that in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, the area of any
spacelike slice is manifestly infinite. However, this is the familiar problem of regulating
the lengths/areas/volumes in AdS, which we know how to deal with. Below, we will use a
simple background subtraction technique, and regulate all quantities by subtracting off the
corresponding values in pure AdS.
    Provided we have this special, maximal spacelike slice Σt through the bulk, we proceed as
outlined above: on this slice, we construct the minimal-area surface anchored at ∂At . This
amounts to a mini-max algorithm for the holographic entanglement entropy; find a maximal
slice in the bulk which agrees with the spacelike foliation of ∂M and in that maximal slice
find a minimal surface X . In this setup, one may obtain a natural proposal that the area of
X then gives the entanglement entropy,

                                                   Area(X )
                                            SA =         (d+1)
                                                                 .                          (2.16)
                                                   4 GN

Note that the surface X by construction satisfies the three basic pre-requisites for being a
candidate dual of the entanglement entropy of A: it is covariantly well-defined, it is anchored
at ∂A, and it reduces to the requisite minimal surface when the bulk spacetime is static.
    However, we will argue that this prescription doesn’t follow naturally from a holographic
viewpoint and needs to be finessed slightly to make contact with the holographic perspective.
Thus, rather than stopping at our candidate surface X , in the next section we will propose
another candidate surface, Y, as a more natural dual of the entanglement entropy. In fact,
this holographic formulation will provide a more straightforward algorithmic construction of
the requisite surface Y. Our starting point is motivated by the idea of light-sheets introduced
in the context of covariant entropy bounds in gravitational theories. We will argue that the
prescription which we find in terms of light-sheets reduces to the intuitive picture presented
above, modulo some subtleties, with the added bonus of providing an explicit equation for
the extremal surface.

requisite surface is a co-dimension two bulk surface which is anchored on the boundary at
∂At . In addition, all of these constructions are fully covariant – they do not depend on
any particular choice of coordinates – and therefore are physically well-defined. Also, these
surfaces are mutually closely related; although different symbols are used to indicate different
constructions, this is not meant to imply that the surfaces thus constructed are necessarily
distinct. In part of what follows we will examine the specific relations between them.

      • W: extremal surface, given by a saddle point of the area action. In 3-dimensional bulk,
        this is simply the spacelike geodesic through the bulk connecting the points ∂At . We
        return to discuss this surface in § 4.1.

      • X : minimal-area surface on maximal-area (co-dimension one) slice of the bulk. The
        construction was motivated in § 2.3 and we will discuss some subtleties and generaliza-
        tions in § 4.2. In particular, we will show that X coincides with the extremal surface
        W if X is situated on a totally geodesic spacelike surface.

      • Y: surface wherefrom the null expansions along the requisite future and past light-
        sheets vanish. This will be the construction we primarily focus on. In fact, we propose
        two constructions, YAmin
                               t
                                  in § 3.1, and Yext in § 3.3. We will later see that YAmin
                                                                                         t
                                                                                            and
        Yext are equivalent to the extremal surface W (we present a proof in the Appendix B).

      • Z: ‘causal construction,’ discussed mainly in Appendix A: minimal-area surface on the
        boundary of the causal wedge of the boundary domain of dependence of At .9

    Our main claim of this paper will be that the covariant holographic entanglement entropy
is obtained from the area of the surface W = Y. In a generic time-dependent spacetime,
we will find that another surface X deviates slightly from W = Y. We will also confirm
that W, X , and Y all reduce to the minimal surface in static bulk spacetime; however this
is not necessarily the case for Z. Nevertheless, Z will be useful because, as we motivate
in Appendix A, it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy, and is computationally
simpler to find.



3        Covariant holographic entanglement entropy and light-sheets

3.1       Light-sheets and covariant constructions

To motivate the natural covariant generalization of a holographic entanglement entropy
proposal, it is useful to recall the construction of covariant entropy bounds in gravitational
    9
        Note added in v3: In the previous versions we had erroneously identified Z as the maximal-area surface
on the boundary of the causal wedge. It has recently been proved in [43] that Z is instead a minimal surface.

theories. The main issue in defining covariant entropy bounds was to put a bound on
the entropy/information passing through a given region of spacetime in a fashion that is
independent of the choice of coordinates or slicing. A clear formulation of covariant entropy
bounds was achieved by Bousso [35, 36, 37] using the concept of light-sheets. A discussion
of this entropy bound applied to the AdS/CFT, which stimulates our arguments below, can
be found in [44].

Fig. 1: A light-sheet LS for a co-dimension two space-like surface S. The null geodesics on the
        light-sheet are converging, i.e., the expansion is non-positive.


    Before proceeding to discuss the relevance of light-sheets for calculating entanglement
entropy, let us review the concept of a light-sheet. Given any co-dimension two spacelike
surface S in a spacetime manifold M, we construct four congruences of future/past null
geodesics from the surface in in-going and out-going directions. A light-sheet LS for S
corresponds to those null geodesic congruences for which the expansion of the null geodesics
is non-positive definite (we will explain the definition of the expansion of null geodesics in
the next subsection; physically, we require that the cross sectional area at a constant affine
parameter along the congruence does not increase). The null geodesics along the light-sheet
are converging and will eventually develop caustics; at any such point the light-sheet gets
cut off. According to the covariant entropy bound (Bousso bound), the entropy or amount
of information SLS that can pass through a light-sheet (i.e. the integral of the entropy flux
on the light-sheet [45]) is bounded by the area of spacelike surface as follows:
                                                  Area(S)
                                         SL S ≤           .                               (3.1)
                                                   4 GN
    We would like to propose that the correct generalization of the holographic entanglement
entropy is in terms of these light-sheets. One can motivate this claim by analyzing the QFT
coupled to gravity as in a brane-world set-up (i.e., RS II model [46]). Indeed, the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy of brane-world black holes can be interpreted as an entanglement entropy
in this setup, as discussed in [28, 20].
   Consider the setup of the AdSd+1 /CFTd with an explicit UV cut-off in the bulk, z > ε,
where z is the AdS radial coordinate, chosen such that the boundary is at z = 0. We choose

The UV cut-off ε is infinitesimally small and is interpreted as a lattice spacing. This setup is
equivalent to the one of the brane-world where a very weak gravity exists on the d dimensional
brane located on the cut-off surface. The Newton’s constant for the brane will be taken to

    Since the brane-world theory has gravity coupled to the QFT, we can consider the Bousso
bound for the d dimensional boundary theory. We then would like to translate the compu-
tation of this bound holographically into a calculation from the viewpoint of the bulk d + 1
dimensional gravity. In the boundary the calculation would proceed by finding the light-
sheets associated with the particular region A we want to focus on. Since in the boundary
field theory the light-sheets bound the region which is relevant for any entropy bound, the
corresponding bulk prescription should likewise include no more than this region. A natu-
ral expectation is then that the co-dimension two surface in the boundary has a canonical
extension into the bulk spacetime in such a way that the associated bulk light-sheets are
anchored on the boundary light-sheets under the appropriate restriction. Of course, there are
potentially many surfaces that satisfy this requirement; we will then pick the one that gives
the strongest bound on the bulk entropy. Our claim then amounts to the statement that the
dual bulk entropy bounds can be found by extending the boundary light-sheet (which was
employed to find the covariant entropy bound in the boundary theory) into the bulk.
   One intriguing consequence of this proposal is that the bulk results include quantum
corrections, while the boundary results do not, as is familiar in AdS/CFT. Let us see how
these quantum corrections look like in a specific example. We are interested in the Bousso
bound for the spacelike surface Sd−2 , i.e. a d − 2 dimensional sphere with the radius l in
the d dimensional brane-world. We choose A a submanifold on a time-slice t = t0 such that
∂A = Sd−2 . At the classical level, we obtain the entropy bound
                                              Area(∂A)
                                       SA ≤         (d)

In order to take into account the quantum corrections, we extend the light-sheet from ∂A =
Sd−2 to that from half of a d − 1 dimensional sphere SA in the bulk AdS. Then we obtain
the quantum corrected entropy bound

The finite difference between the above quantum and classical entropy bound is analogous
to the Casimir energy.
    An alternate way to explain our motivation for considering light-sheets is to think of the
entanglement entropy as being directly related to the (thermodynamic) entropy computed
by the Bousso bound. More precisely, we would like to claim that the entanglement entropy
saturates the Bousso bound in the setup of the AdS/CFT correspondence or the related
brane-world version. While the claim that entanglement entropy is related to light-sheets
is a priori very surprising, the example of the static AdS background strongly suggests
this interpretation (see also [25]). Similarly, the bulk-boundary relation (so called GKP-W
relation [38, 39]) in the AdS/CFT correspondence leads to the same conclusion. A weaker
version of this claim will be that the entanglement entropy satisfies the Bousso bound. What
we have argued in the above is summarized as the following proposal for direct holographic
computation of entanglement entropy.


A Covariant Entanglement Entropy Proposal (I): Consider the usual AdS/CFT
setup in a d + 1 dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime M with d dimensional boundary
∂M. We will choose the boundary ∂M to be either R1,d−1 or R × Sd−1 ; in the following
we usually assume Poincaré coordinates for simplicity. As explained earlier, at time t, we
divide the d − 1 dimensional space of the boundary theory into At and Bt . The boundary
∂At between these domains will play an important role. Note that ∂At is a d −2 dimensional
spacelike surface in ∂M.
    Now, we can construct the upper and lower light-sheets ∂L+             −
                                                                  t and ∂Lt for the spacelike
surface ∂At . This can be done in a straightforward manner using the conformally flat metric
on ∂M. We then consider extensions L±                               ±
                                        t of the two light-sheets ∂Lt into bulk such that they
are the light-sheets in M with respect to a d − 1 dimensional spacelike surface Yt = L+t ∩ Lt
                                                                                             −

as in the left figure of Fig. 2.
   Given this, we propose that the (possibly time-dependent) entanglement entropy for the
subsystem At in the dual boundary theory is given by

                                             minY (Area(Yt ))
                                 SAt (t) =           (d+1)
                                                                  .                      (3.6)
                                                 4 GN

Here minY (Area(Yt )) denotes the minimum of the area over the set of Y as we vary the form
of L±                                                       ±
    t satisfying the above mentioned conditions with ∂Lt fixed. We denote this minimal
area surface YAmin
                t
                   . Essentially we then have the analog of (2.2),

3.2     Expansions of null geodesics

As we have already seen, the definition of the light-sheet involves the expansions of null
geodesics. Since this quantity plays a crucial role in the discussions below, we will pause to
explain its definition and properties (for details refer to e.g., [47, 44, 48]).
      Given a co-dimension two surface S in a spacetime manifold specified by two constraints

                                     ϕ1 (xν ) = 0 ,        ϕ2 (xν ) = 0 ,                            (3.8)

we can define two one-forms ∇ν ϕi , i = 1, 2. Non-degeneracy requires that there be two
linearly independent one-forms and so ∇ν ϕ1 + µ ∇ν ϕ2 has to be a null one-form for two
distinct values of µ. Using this information one can construct two null-vectors N±µ that are
orthogonal to the surface of interest:

                                    N±µ = g µν (∇ν ϕ1 + µ± ∇ν ϕ2 ) .                                 (3.9)
We can fix the null vectors to be normalized such that

                                            N+µ N−ν gµν = −1 .                                      (3.10)
In terms of N±µ and the induced metric hµν on the surface S we can write down the null
extrinsic curvatures:
                              (χ± )µν = hρµ hλν ∇ρ (N± )λ .                     (3.11)

   The expansion of an orthogonal null geodesic congruence to the surface is then given by
the trace of the null extrinsic curvature10

                                               θ± = (χ± )µµ .                                       (3.12)

      Because we are interested in null geodesic congruences, there is no natural scale associated with the

                                                      19
    Physically, the null expansions measure the rate of change of the area of the co-dimension
two surface S propagated along the null vectors. Let us express the embedding map from S
to the spacetime M by X µ (ξ α), where ξ α denote the coordinates on S. Under an infinitesimal
deformation δX µ (ξ α) orthogonal to S with fixed boundary conditions, the change in the area
of S is obtained from the value of the expansions (see e.g. [49]):
                                    Z
                            δArea ∝    (θ+ N+µ δXµ + θ− N−µ δXµ ) ,                     (3.13)
                                           S

where the proportionality constant is positive. Therefore determining the sign of the null
expansions θ± is equivalent to finding whether the area increases or decreases when we
perform an infinitesimal deformation. In addition, (3.13) clearly shows that the surfaces
S with vanishing null expansions are extremal surfaces W, i.e., saddle points of the area
functional. An explicit proof of this is given in Appendix B.


3.3    The covariant entanglement entropy prescription and extremal surface

In § 3.1 we presented a covariant proposal for calculating the holographic entanglement
entropy based on a light-sheet construction. Although manifestly covariant, the computation
of the surface YA still involves first constructing all possible light-sheets in the bulk L±
subject to the appropriate boundary condition and then minimizing the area of the spacelike
co-dimension two slice Y = L+ ∩ L− over all the possibilities. We now argue that this
procedure can be vastly streamlined to produce a simple set of partial differential equations
for the surface. Furthermore, in § 4.1 we will show that the resulting prescription follows
naturally from a bulk–boundary relation a la., GKP-W [38, 39] in the AdS/CFT context.
    The covariant construction of § 3.1 starts from the two boundary light-sheets, ∂L+t (fu-
              −
ture) and ∂Lt (past), which are uniquely defined given a subsystem At in the dual CFT
on ∂M at time t. We then pick a co-dimension two spacelike surface YAt in M whose
boundaries coincide with ∂At as in Fig. 2. There are many such surfaces, but we are only
interested in the ones which we can sandwich between the two light-sheets L+ (future) and
L− (past) in the bulk spacetime. The existence of such light-sheets leads to the constraints
for the expansions,
                                   θ+̂ ≤ 0 ,      θ−̂ ≤ 0 ,                           (3.14)
where θ+̂ refers to the expansion along the null congruence generating L+ and similarly θ−̂
for L− . The expansions θ±̂ are equal to θ± defined in § 3.2 up to a sign. Along a single
affine parameter along the congruence. We can choose to normalize the null vectors by scaling N± → γ± N±
(γ± are functions on S), whilst keeping them tangent to the null geodesics. In practice, we usually omit
the scaling, since we are typically interested only in the sign of the expansions, and these scale simply as
θ± → γ± θ± . However, if the rescaling is singular i.e., γ = 0 or γ = ∞, such simplification is not possible.
This occurs the case where S coincides with an apparent horizon as will be discussed in § 6.6.

                                                     20
light-sheet, say L+ with θ+̂ ≤ 0, small deformations of the surface YA into Y1 and Y2
(sketched in Fig. 2) always yield the inequality Area(Y1 ) ≤ Area(YA ) ≤ Area(Y2 ). Among
infinitely many choices of such surfaces YA , we single out the one whose area becomes the
minimum. Of course, there is no minimal surface if we search all surfaces with the same
boundary condition due to the Lorentzian signature. The additional condition (3.14) of the
non-positive expansions along both light-sheets is crucial for the existence of this minimum.
    Now pick a generic surface YAt which is not necessarily the minimal one, such that the
null expansions are negative everywhere on YAt . We expect that such a surface reaches in
further than the minimal surface, as can be checked by examining explicit examples in § 5.
As is clear from the formula (3.13), if we slightly deform the surface towards the boundary,
its area decreases because θ±̂ ≤ 0. We will be able to continue this deformation until both
of the expansions become zero. The surface obtained in this way has the area which is
minimum among those surfaces which allow the light-sheet construction. The validity of the
assumed structure of expansions which allows such a deformation can be confirmed in an
explicit example of AdS3 , as shown in the Fig. 3 in § 5.1.3.
    The above procedure constructs the surface whose null expansions are both vanishing.
As we have seen in § 3.2, this means that this surface obtained from the minimization
procedure (3.6) is equivalent to the extremal surface defined by the stationary point of
the area functional. Clearly this argument of equivalence is rather speculative; we leave a
rigorous proof as an interesting problem for the future. To summarize, we have obtained the
following proposal:


Covariant holographic entanglement entropy proposal (II): We claim that the holo-
graphic entanglement entropy for a region A is given by
                                            Area(Yext)
                                     SA =         (d+1)
                                                          ,                            (3.15)
                                             4 GN
where Yext is a co-dimension two surface in M which has zero null geodesic expansions, i.e.,
both θ± vanish on Yext, and which satisfies ∂Yext = ∂A. If this surface is not unique, we
choose the one whose area is minimum among all such surfaces homotopically equivalent to
A. Also by virtue of (3.13) and the discussion of Appendix B, we have Yext = W. So we can
just as well replace Area(Yext) in (3.15) by Area(W) without loss of generality. Henceforth
we will drop the subscript ‘ext’ on Yext and simply denote the surface with vanishing null
expansions by Y.



4   Relations between covariant constructions

In the previous section we have motivated a covariant prescription for calculating the holo-
graphic entanglement entropy using light-sheets, in analogy with the covariant entropy

                                             21
bounds. This construction involves finding a surface Yext with vanishing null expansions,
which as we discuss, is equivalent to the extremal surface W. We have also hitherto intro-
duced another natural covariant surface: a minimal surface on a maximal slice, X .
   In this section, after we show that the covariant proposal (3.15) can indeed be also
derived from the basic principle of AdS/CFT, we will proceed to discuss the detailed relations
between W(= Yext) and X .


4.1      Equivalence of W and Y via variational principles

In the time-dependent setup discussed in § 2.3, we can directly apply the Lorentzian GKP-W
relation (see e.g., [50]) as long as the UV limit of the theory becomes conformal. Assuming
that the boundary field theory is in a pure state, we have the path-integral expressions for
the reduced density matrix analogous to the situation in § 2.2:
                                     Dϕ eiSsugra (ϕ) hβ|ϕ(t − ǫ)ihϕ(t + ǫ)|αi
                                   R
                      [ρA (t)]αβ =             R                              ,        (4.1)
                                                   Dϕ eiSsugra (ϕ)
The boundary conditions (which will be implemented on a suitable cut-off surface) ϕ = ϕ±
are the ones induced from the ‘indices’ ϕ± of the density matrix [ρA (t)]ϕ+ ϕ− . This is a
Lorentzian generalization of the argument in [27], where the proposal of [24, 10] was first
proven.
    The CFT partition function Zn in (2.14) is now holographically equivalent to the partition
function Znsugra of the supergravity on the dual manifold Mn which is obtained by solving
Einstein equations while requiring that it approaches ∂Mn at the boundary. Since the
original manifold ∂Mn includes the singular surface ∂A with a negative deficit angle 2π(1 −
n), its holographical extension Mn has the co-dimension two deficit angle surface W. If we
employ the tree level supergravity approximation, the action can be estimated11 by
                 i           √                1−n         √
                         Z                             Z
                   (d+1)
                               −g (R + Λ) =      (d+1)
                                                            g + (irrelevant terms),      (4.2)
             16π GN       Mn                 4 GN       W

where the irrelevant terms signify those which cancel between the two terms in (2.15).
    In this way, after taking the derivative with respect to n as in (2.15), we obtain the
holographic formula
                                            Area(W)
                                     SA =       (d+1)
                                                      .                                 (4.3)
                                             4 GN
Moreover, the action principle in the gravity theory instructs us to single out the extremal
surface W among infinitely many choices of co-dimension two surfaces, that a priori could
  11
       The curvature is delta function localized along the deficit angle surface. In actual computation, we
estimate this contribution by analytically continuing to the Euclidean signature. This explains the imaginary
factor i in (4.2).

                                                     22
be the extension into the bulk of the region A satisfying the required boundary conditions.
This completes the derivation of the holographic formula (3.15) of the entanglement entropy
in time-dependent backgrounds. Since a differential geometrical analysis shows W = Yext
(see Appendix B), the above derivation may be viewed as a heuristic proof of our covariant
proposal.


4.2   Equivalence of X and Y on totally geodesic surfaces

In motivating the existence of a covariant formulation of holographic entanglement entropy,
we argued that one could in principle choose a preferred slicing of the bulk corresponding to
the maximal area slices and then use the holographic entanglement entropy proposal of [24,
10]. We will argue that while the maximal surfaces X don’t generically coincide with W or Y,
there is a special case wherein this proposal for X is equivalent to the covariant entanglement
entropy proposal for Y formulated in terms of the light-sheets and the expansion along null
geodesic congruences. The specific restriction on the maximal slices which turns out to be
relevant is the notion of “totally geodesic submanifold”.
    To examine this issue, it is useful to recall a few geometric facts related to foliation of
spacetimes and extrinsic curvatures. For a co-dimension one spacelike sub-manifold Σ in M,
anchored at some time t in ∂M, with τ µ ≡ (∂τ )µ being the unit timelike normal to Σ, we
define the induced metric on Σ:
                                      γµν = gµν + τµ τν ,                                 (4.4)
and extrinsic curvature:
                                    Kµν = γ ρµ γ σν ∇ρ τσ .                               (4.5)
Here and in the following, ∇µ will denote the covariant derivative with respect to the full
bulk metric gµν . Now, we can look for a minimal surface S in Σ. For such a putative minimal
surface S, let sµ denote the unit spacelike normal to S lying within Σ, so that sµ τµ = 0
everywhere. Then we can again define the induced metric on the surface S:

                                     hµν = γµν − sµ sν ,                                  (4.6)

and the extrinsic curvature of S in Σ:

                                     πµν = hρµ hσν Dρ sσ ,                                (4.7)

where Dµ is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric γµν on Σ, which is related to
the spacetime covariant derivative by projection from M:

                                    Dµ sν = γ ρµ γ σν ∇ρ sσ .                             (4.8)

This implies that
                                     πµν = hρµ hσν ∇ρ sσ .                                (4.9)

                                               23
    We now turn to the question of interest: assuming that S is a minimal surface on the
particular slice Σ corresponding to the maximal slice of M, under what conditions does the
null geodesic expansion along N µ ∝ τ µ ± sµ vanish?
    Since we assume that Σ is a maximal slice, we necessarily have Kµµ = 0, i.e., the trace
of the extrinsic curvature vanishes everywhere on Σ, which implies that

                                               ∇µ τ µ = 0 .                                           (4.10)

Similarly, the constraint that S is a minimal surface in Σ implies that πµµ = 0, which leads
to the identity
                                     ∇µ sµ = sν τ µ ∇µ τν .                           (4.11)
Having extracted the two relations implied by Σ being the maximal slice in M and S being
the minimal surface in Σ, we now turn to evaluate the null expansions θ± . Using (3.12) with
N±µ ∝ τ µ ± sµ , we obtain:

                             θ± ∝ Kµµ ± πµµ − sν sµ ∇µ τν = τ ν sµ ∇µ sν                              (4.12)

where the second equality used Kµµ = 0, πµµ = 0 and sµ τµ = 0. So θ± will vanish provided
we have τ ν sµ ∇µ sν = 0, which is equivalent to the condition Kµν sµ sν = 0.
    Thus we see that for the null geodesic congruence to have vanishing expansion, it does
not suffice for the surface Σ to be a maximal slice. We must in addition require that
Kµν sµ sν = 0. This is satisfied only12 when Kµν = 0 since the vector sµ can be taken to be
arbitrary. Such a surface is called a totally geodesic submanifold, and it describes a surface
whose geodesics are also geodesics of the entire spacetime. One can quickly intuit this by
noting that if sµ were tangent to a geodesic then sµ ∇µ sσ ∝ sσ , which by virtue of sµ τµ = 0
will imply the vanishing of θ± . This leads to the following claim:
Claim: Assume that a maximal spacelike surface Σt (anchored at a constant time t on
∂M) is totally geodesic. Then the minimal surface X on Σt is equivalent to the surface
Yext in the covariant entanglement entropy prescription of § 3.3. However, if we require Σt
to be totally geodesic for all t, i.e. if the spacetime M allows a totally geodesic foliation,
then the spacetime must be static. This is because the condition Kµν = 0 means that
the hypersurface orthogonal timelike vector τ µ is in fact a Killing vector. In this case, the
covariant construction reduces to the minimal surface prescription (2.2).
    Hence we see that the covariant entanglement entropy candidate X reproduces the ‘cor-
rect’ prescription W = Y for all time only in the trivial case of static bulk geometries.
However, if we relax the requirement of full foliation of M by totally geodesic slices, but
  12
       Note that while Kµν sµ sν = 0 only picks out the symmetric part of Kµν , the antisymmetric part is
automatically guaranteed to vanish whenever τ µ is hypersurface orthogonal, i.e. τ[µ ∇ν τρ] = 0, which is the
present case.


                                                     24
rather achieve Kµν = 0 on a single slice, say at t = 0, then we still have13 Xt=0 = Yt=0 . For
example, in a spacetime with time reversal symmetry t ↔ −t, at time t = 0 we can compute
the entanglement entropy by using the minimal surface Xt=0 in Σt=0 (in this case the t = 0
slice).



5        Consistency checks for time-independent backgrounds

Thus far we have kept our discussion at a reasonably abstract level; we have formulated
a clear algorithm for constructing the bulk surface whose area captures the entanglement
entropy associated with the boundary region A in question. A simple consistency check of
our picture is that the covariant proposal should reduce to the holographic entanglement
entropy proposal of [24, 10] whenever the bulk spacetime is static. To make contact with
that discussion, we examine several examples of asymptotically AdS static spacetimes. This
also allows us to see explicitly the equivalence between the light-sheet construction Y and
the extremal surface proposal W, thereby making explicit the arguments of § 3.1 and § 3.3.
Finally we will turn to an example of a stationary spacetime (rotating BTZ geometry) to
illustrate the shortcomings of the minimal surface on a maximal slice prescription X of § 2.3.


5.1        AdS3

First consider the AdS3 geometry described by the Poincaré metric
                                                  −dt2 + dx2 + dz 2
                                          ds2 =                     .                                   (5.1)
                                                         z2
We begin by studying the null expansions for a co-dimension two surface by choosing a
particular ansatz and compute the covariant holographic entanglement entropy.


5.1.1        Expansions of null geodesics

A general co-dimension two curve S in (5.1) is described by the constraint functions

                                    ϕ1 = t − G(z) ,         ϕ2 = x − F (z) .                            (5.2)

The normalized null vectors orthogonal to S are then given by the following linear combina-
tions
                            (N± )µ = N g µν (∇ν ϕ1 + µ± ∇ν ϕ2 ) ,                     (5.3)
    13
         In this case we can easily prove the strong subadditivity of holographic entanglement entropy [25] as
in [26] since two minimal surfaces on the same time slice can intersect with each other if they do so at the
boundary of AdS.

parts of this paper as we are only interested in their signs.14 Moreover, the induced metric

    To compute the expansions (3.12) from S, we need to calculate the covariant derivative

5.1.2      Extremal surface and holographic entanglement entropy

While we have written the expression for expansions for a general curve S in AdS3 parame-
terized as (5.2), by virtue of time translation invariance, we expect that the desired extremal
surface (curve) lies on a constant t slice. Let us therefore concentrate on a curve S0 in (5.1)
with no temporal variation, by requiring G(z) = 0. Then the expansions for S0 are simplified
to
                                         −z F ′′ (z) + F ′ (z) + F ′ (z)3
                           θ+ = −θ− =         √                     3     .                (5.8)
                                                  2 (1 + F ′ (z)2 ) 2

       If we rescale N+ → γ N+ and N− → γ −1 N− , the normalization conditions N+ N−µ = −1 and N± N± µ =
0 are unchanged. The geodesic expansion scales like the null vectors i.e., θ+ → γ θ+ and θ− → γ −1 θ− .
Because we are interested in the condition θ± = 0, this non-zero scale factor is inconsequential except some
singular cases where apparent horizons exist.
   15
      One can check that the three-metric (5.5) is degenerate, as required. For purposes of computing the
expansions, it is more useful to work with this degenerate three-metric rather than the one-metric on the
curve, to ensure the correct projections of ∇µ Nν .

                                                      26
Notice that the expansion in the time direction is vanishing, i.e., θ+ + θ− = 0, because the
spacetime is static.
   To find the covariant holographic entanglement entropy candidate Y to utilize our pro-
posal (3.15), we require that both null expansions vanish. This leads to the equation

                              z F ′′ (z) − F ′ (z) − (F ′ (z))3 = 0 ,                   (5.9)

which determines the requisite surface. We can easily find the following simple solutions:
                                            √
                                    F (z) = h2 − z 2 ,                                (5.10)

where h is an arbitrary non-negative constant. This means that the half circle x2 + z 2 = h2
(z > 0) is the curve YA responsible for the entanglement entropy when we choose the
subsystem A to be an interval with length 2h.
    As can be easily verified, this curve also describes a spacelike geodesic in AdS3 and
likewise corresponds to the minimal surface on the constant t slice. This makes explicit the
assertion made earlier that minimal surfaces on a constant time slice in a static spacetimes
have vanishing null expansions. Hence we have verified, for the AdS3 example, that WA =
XA = YA for any region A, and given an explicit equation for this surface. To compute
the holographic dual of the entanglement entropy SA itself, we need to calculate the proper
length along this bulk surface.
   The length L of YA is found to be
                                   Z h
                                            dz           2h
                           L = 2h        √        = 2 log ,                            (5.11)
                                     ε z

                                           h −z 2         ε
where ε is the lattice spacing corresponding to the UV cut-off. Using the relation between
the central charge of the dual CFT and the bulk Newton’s constant c = 3(3) [51], we obtain
                                                                         2GN
the expression in the dual CFT language
                                            L         c     2h
                                  SA =      (3)
                                                  =     log    .                       (5.12)
                                          4GN         3      ε

This reproduces the well-known formula in 2D conformal field theory [6, 5].


5.1.3   Structure of the sign of expansions

The signs of expansions of null geodesics are directly related to the change of the area of a
given spacelike surface under an infinitesimal deformation as the formula (3.13) shows. In
this subsection, we discuss how the signs of the expansions change in explicit examples.
   We start with the 3 dimensional flat spacetime R1,2 : ds2 = −dt2 + dx2 + dz 2 . If we
consider the curve t = constant and x = F (z), the null vectors N±µ are given by the formula

                                                27
                                                                           √
                                                                              1+F ′2
(5.3) with the modification that N of (5.4) now becomes N = √                              . The expansions
                                                                          2 (1+F ′2 +G′2 )
are found to be
                                                    F ′′ (z)
                             θ+ = −θ− = − √                           .                             (5.13)
                                               2 (1 + F ′ (z)2 )3/2
In the particular case of the circle x2 + z 2 = h2 , we find θ+ = −θ− = √12 h > 0 when x ≥ 0.
When x is negative we obtain the opposite result.
    From the formula (3.13) and the normalization (N+ )µ (N− )µ = −1, we find that θ±
measure the increase of area under the infinitesimal deformations δX µ ∝ −N∓µ . The signs
θ+̂ ≡ −θ+ < 0 and θ−̂ ≡ θ− < 0 for the circle can be intuited directly as the null vector
N+̂ = −N+ is ingoing along the future light-cone and N−̂ = N− is ingoing along the past
light-cone. We thus see that the past and future light-cones emanating from the circle are
examples of light-sheets as we have explained in (3.14) (see Fig. 1). Note also that θ+ − θ− > 0
means that the expansion in the spacelike direction is positive, which illustrates the basic
fact that the length of the circle increases as the radius h becomes larger.
   Now we move on to the more interesting case (5.1) of AdS3 . The null expansions for static
curves are already computed in (5.8). On the curve defined by the ellipse x2 + b2 z 2 = h2 for
a positive constant b, we find that when x ≥ 0 (for x < 0 the result has the signs reversed),
                                               b4 (1 − b2 ) z 3
                          θ+ = −θ− = √                                      .                       (5.14)
                                          2 (h2 + b2 (b2 − 1) z 2 )3/2
Thus the expansions of ingoing null geodesics θ+̂ = −θ+ and θ−̂ = θ− are negative when
b < 1, i.e., when the curve goes deep into the IR region, while it becomes positive when b > 1.
Furthermore, the expansions in AdS3 are vanishing when the curve is a half-circle, which
coincides with the minimal surface. Thus we conclude that the null geodesic congruences on
this ellipse can be used as light-sheets only when b ≤ 1.
    In the AdS3 background we can notice one more interesting fact: for any curve on the
light-cone, one of the two null expansions is vanishing, as will also be shown in § 5.2.3. For
                                                                            √
example, if we consider an arbitrary curve on the future light-cone t = − x2 + z 2 , it turns
out that θ+̂ = 0 when x ≥ 0, while θ−̂ = 0 when x < 0. This property can be easily
generalized to higher dimensional AdS spaces. The behavior of expansions θ±̂ in AdS3 is
summarized in Fig. 3.
    In this way we observed that in (asymptotically) AdS spacetimes, the expansions of null
geodesics can change their sign at the specific points in the bulk. This property clearly plays
a crucial role in our holographic computation of entanglement entropy.


5.2   Higher dimensional examples: AdSd+1

We can repeat the above computations of null expansions for AdSd+1 (3.2). In these higher
dimensional examples, there are many different choices for the shape of region A. Working

Fig. 3: The signs of expansions θ±̂ for the ingoing null geodesics in AdS3. We projected the AdS3
         to the plane x = 0 assuming a particular series of curves whose null expansions each take the
         same sign at any points. The shaded region denotes the region where two light-sheets exist.



in Poincaré coordinates we can choose an arbitrary region on the boundary R1,d−1 and in
principle figure out the associated extremal surfaces. For simplicity, we will concentrate on
two specific examples, where we assume the subsystem A in the dual CFT is given by (i) an
infinite strip and (ii) a spherical ball in R1,d−1 .


5.2.1   Infinite strip in AdSd+1

On the boundary of AdSd+1 in Poincaré coordinates we choose the region A to be an infinite
strip defined as

        A := {(t, ~x) | t = 0, |x1 | ≤ h, xi = arbitrary for i = 2, . . . , d − 1} .           (5.15)

Here we have singled out one of the spatial coordinates in R1,d−1 called x1 to take values in
finite range. To find the associated extremal surface in the bulk, we choose an ansatz for
co-dimension two surface in AdSd+1 by the two constraints (5.2), with a trivial relabeling
x1 → x. We require that when restricted to the boundary z → 0, the extremal surface is
reduced to the boundary ∂A of infinite strip.




                                                 29
  The null expansions of this surface can be shown to be (here d˜ = d − 1)

      ∓H 1 + (F ′ )2 − (G′ )2 − d˜(G′ )3 + G′ (d˜ + d˜(F ′ )2 + z F ′ F ′′ ) − z (F ′ )2 G′′ − z G′′

where we define

                           H = d˜F ′ (G′ )2 − d˜F ′ − d˜(F ′ )3 + z F ′′ .                     (5.17)

    Again by virtue of the staticity of the background it suffices to consider only F (z) 6= 0
while G(z) = 0. It is easy to see that the vanishing of both the null expansions for the
surface localized on a constant t slice leads to the known minimal surface [24, 10],

where z∗ is the maximal z value reached by the surface, given in terms of the width of the
region A by the relation
                                          Γ( 21d˜)

                                                 2d˜ )
We can obtain the entanglement entropy from the area of this surface. For details, we refer
the reader to [10].


5.2.2   3-dimensional ball in AdS5

Our previous examples have focussed on planar symmetry and we now turn to an example
where the region A of interest is a ball in Rd−1 ⊂ R1,d−1 with radius h. The region A is
given as (for simplicity we choose t = 0)

                                  A := (t, ~x) | t = 0, ξ 2 ≤ h2

where ξ is the radial coordinate of the Poincaré metric in the polar coordinates

                                                   z2
An ansatz for surfaces which respect the spherical symmetry is given by

                                ϕ1 = t − G(z),          ϕ2 = ξ − F (z) .                       (5.22)




                                                   30
Further imposing the staticity inherited from the background leads to the simplification16
G(z) = 0. For the particular case of AdS5 the null vectors normalized according to our usual
convention are then given by:

One can check these null expansions vanish for the minimal surface

The entanglement entropy associated with the region A of (5.20) can be calculated from the
area of this surface. As expected, the surface (5.26) coincides with the minimal surface of [10].
We refer the interested reader to [10] for a detailed discussion of the area and comparisons of
the holographic entanglement entropy thus obtained to the field theory calculations at weak
coupling.


5.2.3       Area and expansion of surfaces on the light-cone

In § 3.2 we presented the relation between the change in the area of a spacelike surface
under a small deformation and the expansions of the null geodesics. Here we would like to
understand this relation geometrically in the specific example of AdSd+1 .
   Consider the set-up of the infinite strip region on the boundary as in § 5.2.1 and take
a surface which infinitely extends in the directions x2 , x3 , · · · , xd−1 . Such surfaces can be
  16
       One can evaluate the expansions for non-zero G(z) just as easily and check that the surface given in
(5.26) does indeed have vanishing expansions.



                                                     31
described by the ansatz (5.2), with x → x1 . We would like to concentrate on the case where
the surfaces lie on the light-cone17 t2 = x21 + z 2 . These can be parameterized as

                     x1 = p(s) cos(s) ,        z = p(s) sin(s) ,       t(s) = h − p(s),              (5.27)

with the boundary condition p(0) = p(π) = h.
       The area of any of these surfaces given by a particular choice of p(s) is expressed as
                                           Z π−ǫ2
                                                         ds
                               Area(Y) =             d−1
                                                                    .                      (5.28)
                                            ǫ1    sin (s) p(s)d−2
where the boundary condition on the cut-off surface z = ε is being implemented through the
boundary condition z(s = ǫ1,2 ) = ε.
   When d = 2, the expression (5.28) does not depend on the function p(s) which represents
the choice of the curve. This means that the deformation of any curve on a light-cone in
AdS3 does not change its area (as long as we neglect the UV cut-off). This nicely agrees
with the fact that the expansion along the light-sheet is vanishing for   p any curve on it, as
mentioned in § 5.1.3. If we consider the opposite light-cone t + h = x21 + z 2 , we can find
that on the half circle defined by x21 + z 2 = h2 , t = 0 and z > 0, the null expansions are both
vanishing, i.e. this is an extremal surface as we noticed in (5.10).
    On the other hand, in higher dimensions d > 2, the area becomes dependent on p(s).
Furthermore, we can see the inequality Area(Y1 ) > Area(YA ) > Area(Y2 ) where the surfaces
                                       p of Fig. 2. This in particular shows that the ingoing
are labeled in accord with the conventions
expansion along this light-cone t = − x21 + z 2 is positive. Thus we can conclude that we
cannot regard the light-cone (5.27) as a light-sheet in d > 2. This fact can also be confirmed
by direct evaluation of the expansions using (5.16).


5.3      BTZ black hole (non-rotating)

Our next example will be one which is not globally static, but one which has a horizon and
a static patch extending out to the boundary. Consider the BTZ black hole, with a mass
proportional to m, in the Poincaré coordinates [52], [19]

                                                              dr 2
                               ds2 = −(r 2 − m) dt2 +        2
                                                                   + r 2 dx2 .                       (5.29)
                                                           (r − m)

We will pick the region A on the boundary R1,1 with coordinates (t, x) to be at a constant
t slice and a finite interval in x with |x| ≤ h. One can again take as an ansatz for the
extremal surface (5.2) and compute the expansions to derive the differential equations for
  17
       The light-cone in question is the flat space light-cone by virtue of the Poincaré metric (3.2) being
conformally flat.

the functions G(z) and F (z). It is however simpler to exploit the fact that the extremal
surfaces in AdS3 are spacelike geodesics on a constant t slice and find the relevant surface
directly.
   Therefore we would like to find the spacelike geodesics of the form t = constant and
r = r(x) in order to calculate the entanglement entropy. The conservation equation resulting
from the the fact that ∂x is a Killing field leads to a constant Hamiltonian:

   We consider the entanglement entropy defined by dividing the S3 into two hemispheres
A and B. The minimal surface for SA is clearly given by the largest two-sphere ∂A times
the radial direction r. Thus its area is given by
                                             Z ∞       p

We are interested in the difference ∆SA between the entanglement entropy for the region A
in the star geometry (5.36),(5.37) and in pure AdS5 . This difference will capture the excess
entanglement by virtue of the state of the boundary theory being an excited state of the
CFT, and in a sense provide a measure of how many degrees of freedom are excited (and
entangled) in the region in question. One can check that ∆SA is finite and positive; the

5.5     Stationary spacetimes: the rotating BTZ geometry

Our final example of a spacetime with a timelike Killing field (outside ergo-regions) will
be a rotating black hole spacetime. We will use this example to illustrate the inadequacy
of the min-max proposal of § 2.3, providing a more robust confirmation of our light-sheet
construction discussed in § 3.3.


5.5.1     The holographic computation of entanglement entropy

We consider 3 dimensional Kerr-AdS solution (i.e., rotating BTZ black hole) and compute
the holographic entanglement entropy for a finite interval on the boundary. In this example,
as we will see one can no longer assume any constant time slice on which the extremal curve
lives.

If we set r− = 0, then the angular momentum becomes zero and the black hole (5.40)
                                                                               2
becomes identical the static example (5.29) discussed in § 5.3 by setting m = r+ .
    This rotating black hole background (5.40) is dual to a 1+1 dimensional CFT on a circle
at finite temperature β −1 with a potential Ω for the momentum. The radius of the circle is
defined to be l and we assume that the system is at a very high temperature (β ≪ l). The
potential Ω is conjugate to the angular momentum of the rotating black hole.
      The temperature and the potential in the dual CFT are found from the relations
                                                 2πl
                            β± ≡ β (1 ± Ω) =         ,       ∆± ≡ r+ ± r− .                      (5.42)

The dual CFT is then described by the density matrix

                                          ρ = e−β H+β Ω P ,                              (5.43)

where H and P are the Hamiltonian and the momentum of the CFT. Equivalently we can
regard β± = β (1 ± Ω) as the inverse temperatures for the left and right-moving modes.
   To obtain the geodesics explicitly, it is convenient to remember that all BTZ black holes
are locally equivalent to the pure AdS3 . Explicitly, this map is given by (cf., [54])
                                    s

                                     r 2 − r−
This maps the metric (5.40) to the Poincaré metric

                                      ds2 =                  .                           (5.45)
                                                   z2
We know that the spacelike geodesics in pure AdS3 (5.45) are given by the half circles of the
form (X − X∗ )2 + z 2 = h2 on a constant T slice and their boosts w± → γ ±1 w± . Indeed, by
mapping these geodesics in pure AdS3 into the rotating black hole, we can obtain the relevant
extremal surface. Note that despite the spacetime being just stationary, the extremal surface
W = Yext is indeed given by spacelike geodesics.
   Thus we can assume that a series of spacelike geodesics in AdS3 are all situated on some
spacelike hypersurface
                                γ w+ − γ −1 w− = const.                               (5.46)
Since we are considering the subsystem A which is an interval at a fixed time t0 , the value
of t should be the same at the two endpoints of the geodesic. If we define the value of x at
the endpoints by x1 and x2 , this requirement leads to the constraint

                   γ 2 e(x1 +t0 )∆+ − e(x1 −t0 )∆− = γ 2 e(x2 +t0 )∆+ − e(x2 −t0 )∆− .   (5.47)

    The geodesic length in AdS3 (5.45) leads to the holographic entanglement entropy SA =

       ε
         when the length of the interval A on the boundary is ∆x as we have seen in § 5.1.
The UV cut-off z = ε is mapped to the cut-off in the background (5.40) via
                                    p

where ε1,2 denote the cut-off at each of the two endpoints in (5.45). Further, the UV cut-off
r∞ in (5.40) can be identified with the cut-off (i.e., the lattice spacing) ε in the dual CFT
via r∞ = 1/ε. The length of the interval ∆x is easily found to be

       (∆x)2 = ∆w+ ∆w− = e∆+ (x1 +t0 ) − e∆+ (x2 +t0 ) e∆− (x1 −t0 ) − e∆− (x2 −t0 ) .

                                                   36
  Putting these together we obtain the holographic entanglement entropy in the rotating
BTZ geometry to be

where ∆l = (x1 − x2 ) is the length of the interval in the dual CFT. The final answer is
manifestly time-independent as required. Further, if we set Ω = 0, then the above result
reduces to the non-rotating BTZ answer (5.35).


5.5.2   CFT and left-right asymmetric ensembles

We would like to compare the holographic result (5.50) with the entanglement entropy cal-
culated directly from two dimensional CFT in the ensemble (5.43). This can be done by
exploiting the fact that the value Tr (ρnA ) for the reduced density matrix ρA for the subsys-
tem A is equal to the two point function of twist operators whose conformal dimension is
       c
∆n = 24  (n − n1 ) as shown in [5].
  For a CFT defined on a 2 dimensional non-compact plane (Euclidean) and a region A
whose boundaries are at u1 and u2 , one can show that
                                                            − 6c (n− n1 )

                              Tr (ρnA ) =                                     ,         (5.51)
                                                    ε

where ε is the UV cut-off in the CFT. This leads to the well-known formula of the entangle-
ment entropy at zero temperature

                                 ∂                    c    |u1 − u2 |
                       SA = −      log Tr (ρnA )     = log            .                 (5.52)
                                ∂n               n=1  3        ε

   To derive the result at finite β and Ω described by (5.43), we need to periodically identify
the (Euclidean) two dimensional manifold on which the CFT is defined. The total partition
function of this system is given by

                                  Z1 = Tr e−β H+i β ΩE P
                                                                   

where we defined ΩE = −i Ω. For the Euclidean CFT we will take ΩE to be real as is
conventional. This is achieved by the following conformal map

                                         β (1 − i ΩE )
                                  w′ =                 log w .                          (5.54)

ΩE = −iΩ, this precisely agrees with (5.50). It is also intriguing to notice that the expression
                                                                    L    R
factorizes into the left and right moving contributions: SA = SA      + SA , suggesting a left-right
decoupling in the two dimensional CFT.


5.5.3         Comments on the min-max construction

The prime reason for focusing on the rotating BTZ geometry is that it clarifies some of
the arguments regarding the min-max proposal and the associated surface X . While we
motivated the existence of a covariant construction using X , a minimal surface on a maximal
slice, in § 2.3, we subsequently argued that this prescription doesn’t agree with the light-
sheet construction of § 3.3. In fact, we claimed in § 4.2 that the surfaces X and W(=YExt )
generically agree only when the spacetime admits a totally geodesic foliation.
    The rotating BTZ black hole has a Killing field (∂t )µ which is timelike outside the ergo-
regions, but is not hyper-surface orthogonal.20 As a result, while it is true that surfaces of
constant t are maximal, i.e., have K µµ = 0, they do not contain the extremal surface W.
This is also clear from the fact that constant t surfaces are not everywhere spacelike. From
our explicit construction of the geodesic (5.44) and (5.46) it is apparent that the geodesic
moves in t despite being pinned on the boundary at t = t0 at both ends of the interval A.
    By an explicit CFT computation we have confirmed that the covariant holographic en-
tanglement entropy obtained from the surface W is indeed the correct one. While a priori
it was plausible that the surface X provided the covariant generalization of the holographic
entanglement entropy prescription, this example makes it manifest that light-sheets or ex-
tremal surfaces are crucial to capture the correct measure of entanglement. This example
should therefore be viewed as a strong support for our covariant proposal.



6         Entanglement entropy and time-dependence

One of the motivations behind covariantizing the holographic entanglement entropy pro-
posal was to be able to address the question of entanglement entropy in genuine time-
    20
         A necessary and sufficient condition for a vector field ξ µ to be hypersurface orthogonal is ξ[µ ∇ν ξρ] = 0.
                                 µ
It is easy to check that (∂t ) doesn’t satisfy this condition in the metric (5.40).

                                                           38
dependent states. We will now turn to applying our proposal to geometries with explicit
time-dependence. By virtue of the AdS/CFT duality these spacetimes will correspond to
states in the CFT with non-trivial time evolution. However, we do not always have an ex-
plicit CFT description of the state in question. While this hinders direct comparison of the
results on time variation of the entanglement entropy from the geometric perspective with
field theory, it nevertheless provides an interesting qualitative picture (which could be made
quantitative once the dictionary between states in the field theory and geometry becomes
more explicit).


6.1   Vaidya-AdS spacetimes

One of the most important examples in time-dependent gravitational backgrounds will be
the black hole formation process via a collapse of some massive object. As a simplest such
example, we would like to study the Vaidya background which describes the time-dependent
process of a collapse of an idealized radiating star (cf., [55]). The metric of d + 1 dimensional
Vaidya-AdS spacetime is given in Poincaré coordinates as
                                                     d−1
                               m(v)                    X

                     ds = − r − d−2 dv + 2 dv dr + r 2
                                                           dx2i ,                          (6.1)
                                r                      i=1

and in global coordinates by
                                     
                      2       2  m(v)
                   ds = − r + 1 − d−2 dv 2 + 2 dv dr + r 2 dΩ2d−1 .                        (6.2)
                                  r

If we assume that the function m(v) does not depend on the (light-cone) time v, then
the background is exactly the same as the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole solution after a
coordinate transformation. In this sense the Vaidya metric is a simple example of black hole
with a time-dependent mass or temperature.
    The property of null geodesics in AdS Vaidya background has been studied in [53] from
the view point of AdS/CFT correspondence. The authors were interested in using the
geodesics to compute singularities of boundary correlation functions. It was argued that
the geodesic structure (which clearly probes the spacetime geometry) can be read off from
the correlation function and thus a map was provided between geometric information in the
spacetime and the natural observables of the field theory. In particular, it was shown how
the field theory correlation functions could be used to ascertain the formation of a horizon
in the bulk spacetime.
    Given that null geodesics can be used to decipher the map between field theory ob-
servables and geometry, a natural question is whether there is some more information to
be gained from studying other geometric structures – spacelike geodesics or surfaces. We
expect this to be generally the case, because in certain cases, such as in spacetimes with

                                               39
null circular orbits, spacelike geodesics probe more easily further into the bulk than null
geodesics. Furthermore, null geodesics are manifestly insensitive to conformal rescaling of
the spacetime, which is not the case for the spacelike ones. Motivated by these ideas we wish
to ask whether the entanglement entropy of the boundary theory can be used as a non-local
probe of the bulk geometry.
   Hence in the following we wish to calculate a time-dependent entanglement entropy in
the Vaidya-AdS background. We will specifically focus on the 3-dimensional Vaidya-AdS
metric
              ds2 = −f (r, v) dv 2 + 2 dv dr + r 2 dx2 , f (r, v) ≡ r 2 − m(v),   (6.3)
for simplicity. The coordinate x can be either non-compact (Poincaré coordinate) or compact
(global coordinate). When m(v) is a constant m, this background is same as the BTZ black
hole (5.29), which can be confirmed using the coordinate transformation
                                            √ 

where we have also recorded the large r expansion for future use. In the metric (6.3), the
only non-zero component of the energy-momentum tensor (defined by the Einstein’s equation
Tµν = Rµν − 21 R gµν + Λ gµν ) is
                                            1 dm(v)

                                           2 r dv
By imposing the null energy condition i.e., Tµν N µ N ν ≥ 0 for any null vector N µ , we find
that the time-dependent mass m(v) always increases as the time v evolves
                                        dm(v)
                                              ≥0.                                       (6.6)
                                         dv
Below we would like to see how the entanglement entropy computed holographically changes
under this time-evolution.

In order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy, we need to find the minimal
surface and then compute its area. The advantage of our example of the 3 dimensional
Vaidya-AdS spacetime is that the minimal surface is the same as the spacelike geodesic. We
can express the general geodesic by using (the non-affine) parameterization

                        ϕ1 = r − r(x) = 0,        ϕ2 = v − v(x) = 0 .                   (6.7)

   We define the subsystem Av at time v by the region −h ≤ x ≤ h so that it always has
the width 2h. In the dual gravity side, this leads to the following boundary condition along
the geodesic:
                       r(h) = r(−h) = r∞ ,        v(h) = v(−h) = v ,                    (6.8)

                                             40
where r∞ → ∞ is the UV cut-off which is inversely related to the lattice spacing ε i.e.,
r∞ = 1/ε. Note that we can require r(x) = r(−x) and v(x) = v(−x) due to the reflection
symmetry of the background.
       We would like to calculate the length L of this geodesic
                                   Z h    p
                              L=       dx r 2 + 2 r ′ v ′ − f (r, v) v ′2 ,                               (6.9)
                                          −h

where the derivative with respect to x is denoted by the prime ′ . This length functional
being independent of x, we have a conserved quantity
                                        r4
                                            = r 2 + 2 r ′ v ′ − f (r, v) v ′2 ,                          (6.10)
                                        r∗2
where r∗ is a constant. In addition, we get two equations of motion for r and v from the
action principle. As usual, only one of them is independent of the previous conservation
equation (6.10). It is given by
                                      r 2 − r 2 (v ′ )2 − r v ′′ + 2 v ′ r ′ = 0 .                       (6.11)

    Thus we have to solve these ODEs (6.10) and (6.11) in order to find the geodesics. For
a generic m(v), it is unfortunately not easy to find an analytical solution. To obtain an ex-
plicit example, we performed a numerical analysis in the specific case smoothly interpolating
between pure AdS and BTZ,
                                           m0 + 1     v    m0 − 1
                          f (r, v) = r 2 −        tanh −            .                  (6.12)
                                             2        vs      2
Roughly speaking, this corresponds to a null shell of characteristic thickness vs collapsing to
form a BTZ black hole of mass m0 at time v = 0. We can numerically integrate to find the
spacelike geodesics in this geometry. For definiteness, for the result shown below, we chose
vs = 1 and m0 = 1. (Note that in 3 dimensions, unlike in the higher dimensional analogs,
the horizon starts at finite v; in this case v = 0.) Fig. 5 shows several plots (snapshots for
different times v(rmin ) ≡ v0 as labeled) of a series of extremal surfaces.21 As the horizon
grows with increasing v, the plots look similar to different size static BTZ black holes.


6.3      Null expansions in Vaidya-AdS

Having seen the behaviour of the spacelike geodesics which give us the requisite minimal
surface, we next study the null expansions for the curve defined by (6.7) in the three di-
mensional Vaidya-AdS background (6.3). Consider a generic curve parameterized as in (6.7)
  21
       The surfaces will now vary in time as well; here we show just the r − x behaviour. In fact, it is easy to
confirm that the extremal surface W cannot coincide with the minimal surface on a maximal slice X . This
follows simply from the fact that the geodesics anchored at constant v on the boundary do not all lie on a
single spacelike surface in the bulk Vaidya-AdS spacetime.

The expansions for these null vectors are then found to be

                                                          42
After some algebra we can show that both null expansions θ± are vanishing iff the equations
of motion for the geodesic (6.10) and (6.11) are satisfied. This justifies our assertion in the
previous sub-section that the extremal surface in question is given by a spacelike geodesic in
Vaidya-AdS.


6.4   Time-dependent entanglement entropy

Having obtained the extremal surface W for the Vaidya-AdS geometry, we can compute the
entanglement entropy of the region A using the area of W. In particular, we would now
like to return to the original question about time-dependence of the entanglement entropy.
If we assume that the time-dependence of the mass function m(v) in (6.3) is very weak,
m′ (v) ≪ 1, then we can use the adiabatic approximation. First we compute the entropy for
the static three dimensional AdS black hole (i.e. BTZ) and then treat the mass as a function
of time v.
    In the BTZ black hole background, the length of the geodesic is given by the formula
(5.33). The adiabatic approximation allows us to regard m as a time-dependent function
m(v), so that the finite part of the geodesics length, denoted by Lreg (v), becomes
                                                         sinh2 ( m(v) h)
                                                                p
                    Lreg (v) = L(v) − 2 log(2 r∞ ) = log                 .          (6.17)
                                                               m(v)
When the mass is very small m(v) ≪ 1, (6.17) reduces to a regularized proper length as a
function of (light-cone) time v:
                                                       h2
                                Lreg (v) ≃ 2 log h +      m(v) .                        (6.18)
                                                       3
    Now let us recall the monotonicity property (6.6). If we combine it with the expression
(6.17), we can show that the entanglement entropy increases in the adiabatic approximation.
Hence assuming that the matter undergoing collapse to form the black hole satisfies the null
energy condition, it is clear from the adiabatic approximation that the entanglement entropy
∆SA (v) ∝ Lreg (v) increases in the process of a gravitational collapse.
   This claim can also be checked by a direct numerical analysis as shown in Fig. 6 for the
profile (6.12). Not only is it apparent that the proper length increases monotonically with
time, but we can also see that the adiabatic formula (6.17) is actually quite accurate for
vs = 1, m = 1. Note that there is a slight offset in the v-values between the two plots;
presumably this is because of the dynamics, in particular the identification of the v values.
However, if we shift the v value appropriately and overlay the two plots, the fit is almost
perfect as shown in Fig. 7.
   Below we will see that the monotonicity property can be proven via a direct perturbative
analysis and furthermore that it is related to the second law of the black hole thermody-
namics.

6.5   Perturbative proof of entropy increase

Consider the change of the area functional when the surface is deformed slightly. The
infinitesimal shift of the d − 1 dimensional spacelike surface W is described by the deviation
δX µ . In general we find

where gαβ = gµν ∂X∂ξ α ∂ξ β
                            is the induced metric on the surface. β in the final expression is
orthogonal to the submanifold ∂W and Πν is defined such that the equation of motion for
this variational problem is given by Πν = 0.
   This clearly shows that the area of extremal surface does not change under any infinites-
imal deformation provided we keep the same boundary condition or the surface W is closed.
However, since we are interested in changing the boundary condition, corresponding to the
time-evolution, the final term in (6.19), which comes from the boundary contribution via the
partial integration, plays an important role.
   Let us now concentrate on the specific case of the three dimensional Vaidya-AdS space-
time and assume that Wv is the extremal surface at the asymptotic time v as in (6.8). The
equation of motion vanishes on shell by definition; so only the boundary term contributes
and it can be written as:
                               ∂X µ
                                                                  

                Z

where the right hand side should be evaluated on the boundary with the cut-off r = r∞ .
The factor of two in (6.20) arises due to the two endpoints x = ±h. To derive the above
result, we set ξ = r and use the fact g = grr ≃ r12 and the deviation δX µ = δv0 (∂v )µ . As
a consequence, we obtain the following expression for the time-dependence of the geodesic
length for any choice of m(v):

Here we have used that the fact that in the UV limit r = r∞ → ∞, the leading behavior
of the relation between r and v becomes v ≃ constant − 1r . This result (6.21) shows a
remarkable fact that the time-dependence of the entanglement entropy only depends on the
asymptotic form of the function v = v(r).
   To evaluate (6.21) explicitly, let us perform a perturbative analysis by assuming that
the time-dependent mass m(v) is very small and by keeping only its leading perturbation.


                                             45
The details of this computation are described in the Appendix C. The upshot is that the
asymptotic expansion of dv
                        dr
                           is found using (C.19), to be

                               dv   1  h2 m′ (v0 )
                                  ≃ 2−             + O(r −4 ) .                           (6.22)
                               dr  r      6 r3
Plugging this into (6.20), we finally find the time-dependence of the geodesic length

                                    dL(v)   h2 m′ (v0 )
                                          =             ≥ 0.                              (6.23)
                                     dv         3
This precisely agrees with the one obtained from an adiabatic argument (C.15). Notice that
this is non-negative when we impose the null energy condition (6.6).
   In this way we have confirmed the monotonicity property of the entanglement entropy in
the process of a gravitational collapse. It would be an interesting problem to prove this for
any general function m(v). We leave this for future investigation.


6.6   Relation to the second law of black hole thermodynamics

Up to now we have used holography to examine the entanglement entropy for a subsystem
Av at a time v in a two dimensional theory. It is interesting to consider the limit where the
subsystem approaches the total space. In this limit, it turns out that the extremal surface
W covers the whole apparent horizon, as we will explain below. Thus the finite part of
the holographic entanglement entropy is dominated by the contribution from the area of
apparent horizon. The analogous result for static AdS black holes has been already obtained
in [24, 10]. When Av finally coincides with the total system, the end points ∂Av annihilate
with each other and the extremal surface becomes the closed surface defined by the apparent
horizon at time v∗ , where v∗ is the limiting value of the coordinate v on the extremal surface
toward IR region.
    The (future) apparent horizon is defined by the boundary of a (future) trapped surface
[47]. In other words, on the apparent horizon the expansion θout of the outgoing future-
directed null geodesics is vanishing, while the other expansion θin of the ingoing null geodesics
is non-positive (see Fig. 8),
                                     θout = 0 ,     θin ≤ 0 .                              (6.24)


    Let us find an apparent horizon in the Vaidya metric (6.3). Consider the particular class
of co-dimension two surfaces defined by r = constant and v = constant. Then the null
expansions can be read from (6.15) as follows:
                               p                               p

                 θin = −θ+ = −      √        ,  θout = −θ− =       √        .         (6.25)

                                                                                       p
One might naively think the expansions of null geodesics are both vanishing at r = m(v).
However, this is actually not true because we have not normalized the null vectors N± (6.13)
such that they satisfy the geodesic equations N±µ ∇µ N±ν = 0. The correct null vectors are
given by
             Ninµ
                  = − (∂r )µ ,       µ
                                   Nout = 2 γ(r, v) (∂v )µ + f (r, v) γ(r, v) (∂r )µ ,  (6.26)
where γ(r, v) is a positive function determined
                                       p        as a solution to 2 ∂v γ(r, v) + ∂r γ(r, v) +
2 r γ(r, v) = 0 which is smooth at r = m(v). The corresponding expansions of the null
geodesic congruences then become

                                 1                        f (r, v) γ(r, v)
                          θin = − < 0 ,          θout =                    .            (6.27)
                                 r                                r
With these correct normalizations we find that the conditionp(6.24) for an apparent horizon
is satisfied at f (r, v) = 0. Thus we can conclude that r = m(v) is an apparent horizon
in the 3-dimensional Vaidya-AdS metric. While in general in time-dependent backgrounds
the apparent horizon does not coincide with the event horizon, we are guaranteed that event
horizon always lies outside the apparent horizon [47].
    In the above example, the formula (6.15) did not give the correct sign of the expansions,
as the rescaling needed to satisfy the geodesic equation is singular. Since this occurs because
f (r, v) = r 2 − m(v) vanishes on the apparent horizon, for generic curves which do not reach
the apparent horizon this problem does not appear and we can read off the correct sign of
expansion from (6.15).
    Let us now return to the reason for the extremal surface W to almost wrap the apparent
horizon when the subsystem is taken to be as large as the total system. Finding the extremal
surface is equivalent to solving for the vanishing null expansion given by (6.15); the apparent
horizon provides a solution to this criterion, as is manifest from (6.25). Thus we can conclude
that the limit of the subsystem engulfing the entire system, the extremal surface appears

                                                 47
to coincide with a spatial section of the apparent horizon22 (this fact can also be observed
nicely in Fig. 5).
    Therefore we can argue that the total entropy Stot (t) = −Tr ρ(t) log ρ(t) in the dual
time-dependent theory is given by the area of the apparent horizon at t = v∗ . The time-
dependence of Stot means that the evolution of the system is non-unitary; this is the usual
issue of evolution of a density matrix.23 It is also interesting to note that for reproducing
a physical quantity, the apparent horizon, which is defined using local quantities, is more
crucial than the event horizon, whose definition is rather global.
    The second law of black hole thermodynamics tells us that the area of apparent horizon
always increases under any physical process which satisfies the appropriate energy condition
[47] (also cf., [48]). This can be shown explicitly from the condition (6.24) and the basic
formula (3.13), which guarantees that the area increases under an infinitesimal deformation
                                                              µ       µ
δX µ along the evolution of the apparent horizon δX µ ∝ Nout     − Nin  . On the other hand,
we can derive this second law of the apparent horizon area from the monotonicity property
(6.23) by taking the mentioned limit of the minimal surface. In this way the two concepts are
naturally connected with each other. Notice that on both sides the monotonicity stems from
the positive energy condition (with assumption of homogeneity in the dual field theory).
    We note in passing that in the limit of the subsystem A engulfing the system, the temporal
evolution of the extremal surface W is captured by the behaviour of dynamical horizons. A
dynamical horizon is defined to be a smooth, co-dimension one spacelike submanifold of the
spacetime, which can be foliated by a family of closed spacelike surfaces, such that the leaves
of the foliation have one null expansion vanishing and the other null expansion being strictly
negative [56, 48] as in (6.24). It is tempting to infer from this that the results proved for the
area increase of dynamical horizons can be ported to the present situation and in particular
used to establish a “second law of entanglement entropy” from holographic considerations.
  22
       Strictly speaking, as we have argued above, the apparent horizon is not a minimal surface. Moreover,
the full apparent horizon is a bulk co-dimension one surface. We will interpret the fact that the extremal
surface W dips down almost all the way to the location of the apparent horizon and wraps the spatial section
before returning back to the boundary to signify that the area of the apparent horizon plays an important
role in computing the entanglement entropy in the limit of the subsytem A approaching the full system ∂N .
  23
      One could try to interpret this as unitary evolution in a tensor product theory, where the second Hilbert
space is hidden behind the horizon, as in the eternal AdS black hole [21]. Of course, in the dynamical situation
we do not have exact thermal periodicity and this would imply that the ‘shadow CFT’ lives on a shifted
locus in the complex time plane.

7.1        Wormholes in AdS and entanglement entropy

Consider the (entanglement) entropy Stot = −Tr ρtot log ρtot for the total system as in § 6.6.
It is vanishing if the system is in a pure state. When it is non-vanishing, it is usually
interpreted as the thermal entropy and correspondingly its AdS dual spacetime is expected
to have an event horizon. In such examples the total entropy Stot is dual to the Bekenstein-
Hawking entropy of the black hole in question. In Lorentzian geometries such as the eternal
Schwarzschild-AdS geometry, we can equivalently regard the entropy as arising from the
entanglement between the total system and another identical system hidden behind the
horizon as in [21] (cf., also [41] for other examples). A recent discussion of issues relevant
to this context can be found in [57].
    In this section we would like to point out an example which has a non-zero total entropy
Stot and its origin seems to be different from the example mentioned above. In particular, the
example we have in mind is an Euclidean spacetime with no event horizons. These are the
Euclidean AdS wormholes discussed in [40]. They are obtained by considering the hyperbolic
slices of Euclidean AdSd+1 (= Hd+1 )

                                          dsHd+1 = dρ2 + cosh2 ρ ds2Hd ,                                    (7.1)

and by taking a quotient of Hd by a discrete group Γ to generate a compact manifold.
We mainly consider the case d = 2, because in this case the background is perturbatively
stable [40]. Also the dual two dimensional CFT is well-defined on a background of negative
curvature H2 /Γ; a Riemann surface. The two boundaries ∂M1 and ∂M2 are given by the
two limits ρ → ∞ and ρ → −∞. After the quotient by the Fuchsian group Γ, the two
boundaries become the same Riemann surface with genus g ≥ 2 (see Fig. 9).
         Such a solution leads us to a puzzle24 immediately as pointed out in [40]. From the CFT
    24
         There is another possibility that the path-integral over infinitely many such geometries cure the problem

                                                          49
side, we expect that the two CFTs on the two boundaries are decoupled from each other.
Thus all correlation functions between them should be vanishing. However, from the gravity
side, there are non-trivial correlations since the two boundaries are connected through the
bulk.
    Here we would like to point out a possible resolution to this problem. Our claim is that
the CFT1 on ∂M1 and the CFT2 on ∂M2 are actually entangled with each other despite
the absence of an event horizon. To check CFT1 and CFT2 are indeed entangled, we need
to compute the entanglement entropy S1 for the total system of CFT1 . This should coincide
with the entanglement entropy S2 for the CFT2 (we expect that the total system CFT1 ∪
CFT2 to be in a pure state).
   When we choose a Euclidean time-direction locally in the two dimensional space ∂M1 ,
the total system (at a specific time) in CFT1 is defined by a circle C in ∂M1 , which is
topologically non-trivial. This setup can be regarded as a higher genus generalization of the
computation at a finite temperature using Euclidean BTZ black hole done in [10, 24].
    Let us define the circle Cmin in the Riemann surface to be cycle with minimal length
among those which are homotopic to C. Then the minimal surface which is relevant to the
holographic computation of S1 turns out to be the circle Cmin at the throat ρ = 0. This
can be understood as follows; see Fig. 9 below. We first consider the entropy SA assuming
that A is a submanifold of C. Then we can easily find the minimal surface whose end point
at ρ = ∞ coincides with ∂A. As we gradually increase the size of A, the minimal surface
anchored on one boundary dips deeper into the bulk. In the limit A → C the two end points
of ∂A annihilate and the minimal surface gets localized at the throat. So the maximum
entropy is given by the area of the neck. It is clear from the geometric picture that S1 = S2 ,
since both are measured by the area of the throat.
     In this way we find that the entanglement entropy S1 between CFT1 and CFT2 is given
by
                                                   Area(C)
                                       S1 = S2 =         (3)
                                                               > 0.                                 (7.2)
                                                     4 GN
As this is clearly non-vanishing due to the throat connecting the two boundaries, we can
conclude that the two CFTs are entangled with each other. Interestingly, the existence of
such a minimal surface at the throat also plays the crucial role when we present a generic
definition of wormhole as discussed in [58].
    The above definition of entanglement entropy between two CFTs only depends on the
topological class of the cycle C. Thus we can define 2g different entropies when ∂M1 = ∂M2
is a genus g Riemann surface. We would also like to stress that the genus one version of the
above calculation is equivalent to the ordinary Euclidean computation of the Bekenstein-
as discussed in [40]. Here we are assuming that each of perturbatively stable asymptotically AdS solutions
should have its dual CFT interpretation before summing over the geometries.

Hawking entropy of black holes.
    In the above discussion, we have concentrated on Euclidean wormholes. In the Lorentzian
case, the topological censorship [59] (with assumptions about energy conditions) guarantees
that disconnected boundaries are separated from each other by event horizons. This is a
simple consequence of null geodesic convergence following from Raychaudhuri’s equation;
essentially if two disconnected boundaries were in causal communication then null geodesics
which are initially contracting will have to re-expand, violating the null convergence condi-
tion. If we allow the presence of some exotic matter so that the Lorentzian wormholes exist,
the above computation of the entanglement entropy in wormhole geometries can be equally
applied to the Lorentzian case.


7.2   Entanglement entropy of the AdS bubble

Our final example of a time-dependent asymptotically AdS background is the AdS bubble
solution [60, 61]

                         r2
where f (r) = 1 + r 2 − r02 . This is obtained via a double Wick rotation of the Schwarzschild-
AdS black hole in the global coordinates. This solution represents a background where a
                                                                      2
bubble of nothing shrinks from infinite size to a minimum value r+      (7.4) and subsequently
re-expands out as the time evolves from τ = −∞ to τ = ∞. If we consider a double Wick


                                               51
rotation of the (planar) Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in Poincaré coordinates, we obtain the
static AdS bubble (or AdS soliton), whose entanglement entropy was computed in [3] and a
quantitative comparison with the dual Yang-Mills has been made successfully.
   The coordinate χ in (7.3) is compactified and the smoothness of this solution requires
the periodicity χ ∼ χ + ∆χ, where ∆χ is given by
                                                 q              

                           2 r+ +1             2

One can show that this solution is asymptotically AdS as r → ∞. The important point
is that the time t in the asymptotically AdS global coordinate is different from τ in (7.3).
They are related via [61]:

The boundary of the metric (7.3) is dS3 × S1χ , with τ being the deSitter time coordinate.
    Now we are interested in the entanglement entropy SA at fixed time t = t0 in the boundary
theory on dS3 × S1χ . The radius of S2 ⊂ dS3 has a time varying radius ∼ cosh τ . We define
the subsystem A such that its boundary ∂A is T 2 = S1χ × S1 , where the second S1 is the
equator of the S2 . Then the extremal surface will be given by the two dimensional surface
defined by g(τ, χ, r) = 0 times the S1 . To explicitly determine the function g, one needs to
solve a complicated set of partial differential equations.
    If we assume25 r0 ≪ 1 (i.e., ∆χ ∼ 2π r0 ≪ 1), then the condition t = constant is
approximated by τ = constant. To avoid solving the differential equations, we consider a
minimal surface on the time slice defined by t = const. as a further approximation.26 Under
this approximation we can easily find the entanglement entropy:

where r∞ is the UV cut-off. We find that the entropy is proportional to cosh τ ≃ cos1 t . This is
consistent with the known area law of the entanglement entropy because Area(∂A) ∝ cosh τ .
Note that the finite term has a minus sign. This is because the emergence of the bubble
means the disappearance of degrees of freedom as discussed in [3] about the static AdS
bubble example. It would be interesting to understand this time-dependent entanglement
entropy from the dual field theory side and to find the explicit extremal surface for this
geometry.
  25
       Recall that we are working in units where the AdS radius is set to unity.
  26
       Clearly this surface does not coincide with Y in our covariant construction except τ = t = 0. However,
we believe that we can obtain a qualitative behaviour of the time-dependent entanglement entropy using
this approximation.

8    Discussion

    In this paper, we have presented the covariant holographic formula (3.15) (or equivalently
(3.7)) of the entanglement entropy (or von-Neumann entropy) in AdS/CFT correspondence
within the supergravity approximation. We propose that it is simply given by the area of
the extremal surface in a given asymptotically AdS background. This allows us to calculate
entanglement entropy of dual (conformal) field theories even in time-dependent backgrounds.
This is a natural generalization of the previously proposed holographic formula for static AdS
backgrounds [10, 24].
    Our covariant holographic proposal claims that the entanglement entropy SA for the
subsystem A is equal to the area of a certain bulk surface S, which is anchored at the
boundary ∂A, in Planck units as in the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Our main conclusion
is that the surface S is given by the extremal surface W, which is an extremum of the area
functional. We argued that W is equivalent to the surface Y, which we motivated from the
covariant entropy bound. In particular, Y is defined to be the minimal area surface among
the family of co-dimension two bulk surfaces satisfying the requisite boundary conditions
with the additional constraint that they support two light-sheets i.e., the null geodesic con-
gruences directed toward the boundary have non-positive expansion. More constructively,
Y corresponds to the surface with vanishing null expansions. We gave an argument which
supports our claim W = Y; a rigorous proof is left as an intriguing problem for the future.
We also pointed out another potential candidate for a covariantly defined surface, a minimal
surface on a maximal time-slice, X , which reduces to the minimal surface in static space-
times. We showed that X coincides with W when the bulk spacetime is foliated by totally
geodesic spacelike surfaces and argued that generically X doesn’t capture the holographic
entanglement entropy of a specified boundary region.
    We argued that our covariant proposal can be derived naturally using the light-sheet
construction and thus is closely related to the covariant entropy bound (Bousso bound) [35].
At first sight, this relation is rather surprising, since the entropy bound is usually associated
with the thermodynamic entropy while the entanglement entropy has a different origin. It
strongly supports the historical idea that the entanglement entropy is connected with a
microscopic origin of the gravitational entropy with quantum corrections [22, 23] (see also
[20, 28] and references therein). We leave further exploration of this relation as an important
open problem. It would also be interesting to generalize the covariant holographic formula
beyond the supergravity approximation assumed in the above discussion (see [27] for recent
progress in the Euclidean case).
    We believe that deeper understanding of the entanglement entropy will provide crucial
insights into the nature of the holographic relation between quantum gravity and its dual
non-gravitational lower dimensional theory. One reason for this stems from the universality
of the definition of this quantity for any system described by the laws of quantum mechanics.


                                               53
We can deal equally well with diverse systems such as spin chains, quantum Hall liquids,
gauge theories, matrix models, and even cosmological models from this viewpoint. For each,
we can then examine if a holographic dual exists, and then exploit the covariant construction
above to compute the entanglement entropy. The second reason is that the entanglement
entropy is holographically described by a basic geometrical quantity, namely the area of
a well-defined co-dimension two surface, as we have discussed extensively. Given a specific
bulk geometry, which is described by some particular CFT state, we can calculate the proper
areas of the requisite surfaces which we have conjectured to correspond to the entanglement
entropy for that state.
    Conversely, given a specific state of the boundary theory, we can ask how much infor-
mation is encoded in the entanglement entropy. In particular, for a system in a given state
admitting a gravitational dual, if we know the entanglement entropy for all subsystems A
of the boundary, can we decode the full geometry of the gravitational dual corresponding
to that state, at least at the supergravity level? Even though we leave the actual metric
extraction for future work, we believe that most, if not all, of the metric information can
indeed be extracted from the entanglement entropy data by a suitable inversion technique.
    An analogous problem has been discussed in [53], where the singularities in the CFT cor-
relators, the so-called bulk-cone singularities, were used to distinguish different geometries.
The basic idea is that the bulk-cone singularities occur for correlators whose operator inser-
tions are connected by a null geodesic through the bulk spacetime; and since bulk geodesics
are determined by the bulk geometry, knowing the endpoints of null geodesics allows us to
extract a large amount of information about the bulk geometry. Using this technique, [62]
has numerically demonstrated metric extraction for a class of static, spherically symmetric
bulk spacetimes.
    However, null geodesics have their limitations. They are insensitive to conformal rescaling
of the metric, and they probe only the part of the bulk which allows their endpoints to remain
pinned at the boundary. Hence the metric extraction of [62] does not probe the bulk past null
circular orbits. In this respect, a spacelike geodesic, or more generally a spacelike surface,
would bypass both of these shortcomings. This has been confirmed in [63]. Not only are
spacelike geodesics sensitive to the conformal factor, but also they probe deeper into the
bulk while remaining pinned at the boundary. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where metric
extraction would be allowed all the way down to the horizon. Moreover, when the bulk is
4 or higher dimensional, the co-dimension two surfaces are likewise higher-dimensional, and
therefore may be expected to contain a larger amount of information than geodesics which
are only one-dimensional quantities.
   The computation of the entanglement entropy in a time-dependent background is in
general a very hard question due to technical complications. However, our holographic for-
mula allows us to solve this problem simply, provided the system under consideration has
a holographic dual. In this paper, we examined several examples of time-dependent back-


                                              54
grounds. First we considered the 3-dimensional AdS-Vaidya background, which is dual to a
time-dependent background of a 2-dimensional CFT. There we found that the entanglement
entropy computed holographically increases under time evolution. We have also seen that
this is closely related to the second law of the black hole thermodynamics. This result sug-
gests the expected monotonicity property; namely that given the null energy condition, in
any gravitational collapse the entanglement entropy always increases. It would be interesting
to see if monotonicity is preserved once we take into account quantum corrections described
by the Hawking radiation on the gravity side.
    Another example we discussed concerns wormholes in AdS. Even though the two dual
CFTs on the two disconnected boundaries look decoupled from each other, there are non-
vanishing correlation functions from the bulk gravity viewpoint [40]. We proposed a possible
resolution to this puzzle by showing that the entanglement entropy between the two CFTs
is actually non-vanishing. This confirms that they are quantum mechanically entangled.
    Since the concept of entanglement entropy is well-defined in any time-dependent system,
it provides a very useful physical quantity to analyze in a quantum system which is far
from the equilibrium, where we cannot define the usual thermodynamical quantities. At the
same time, it is an important quantity bearing on quantum phase transitions of various low
dimensional systems at zero temperature. Therefore our results can be regarded as a first
step toward the analysis of condensed matter physics using the AdS/CFT correspondence
(see e.g., [64] for other recent interesting approach).

A    Covariant construction of causally-motivated surface Z

Above we have discussed three distinct constructions as candidate covariant duals of the
entanglement entropy, namely the surfaces W, X , and Y. All of these require solving an
extremization problem. However, in § 2.4 we have also mentioned an alternate construction,
Z, which may be computationally simpler to find. This is because the requisite co-dimension
one surface on which we define Z is constructed purely based on causal relations and therefore


                                             55
does not require e.g. solving for geodesics (though in practice, in many examples it is quite
easy to find this by using null geodesics).
       The causal covariant construction Z will be achieved by a series of steps:

   1. Starting with the spatial region At ⊂ ∂Nt ∈ ∂M, construct its domain of dependence
      Dt ⊂ ∂M. This is the set of all boundary points q through which all causal boundary
      curves γq necessarily intersect At ,

                                Dt = { q ∈ ∂M | ∀ γq ∈ ∂M, { γq ∩ At } 6= ∅ }                            (A.1)

   2. Construct the bulk “causal wedge” Ct of the boundary region Dt . This is defined as the
      set of bulk points p from which there exists both a future-directed and a past-directed
      causal curve, γp+ and γp− , which intersects27 Dt .

                 Ct = { p ∈ M | ∃ γp+ , { γp+ ∩ Dt } 6= ∅ and ∃ γp− , { γp− ∩ Dt } 6= ∅ }                (A.2)

   3. Let Bt be the boundary (in the bulk) of Ct . In some simple cases, this is constructed
      from the future and past bulk light-cones from the past and future tip of Dt .

                                  Bt = { p ∈ M \ ∂M ∩ p ∈ ∂Ct } = ∂Ct \ Dt                               (A.3)

   4. Finally, consider the set of all spacelike surfaces lying in Bt and pinned at ∂At . From
      these spacelike surfaces, take one with the minimal area.28 We denote this maximal
      surface by Zt . So we have Zt ∈ Bt ∈ M, ∂Zt = ∂At .

    In Fig. 11 we indicate the construction of Z more explicitly by sketching various 2-
dimensional slices of the spacetime, as labeled. In Table 1 we show the dimensionality
of the various regions discussed and specify whether they lie in the bulk or in the bound-
ary. Recall that the Zt is a co-dimension two surface in M, as is the boundary region At .
Furthermore, this construction does not depend on a choice of coordinates, but only on phys-
ically meaningful quantities: causal relations in the spacetime and proper “area” of a given
spacelike surface. This ensures that we can apply the same construction for time dependent
bulk geometries just as easily.
  27
       For purposes of this definition we treat ∂M as a subset of M, so that a bulk curve can “intersect” (i.e.,
terminate on) the boundary. This is motivated by using the usual “cut-off” surface instead of the actual
boundary. More technically, we want the ideal points associated with the TIP or TIF of the requisite curve
through p to lie in Dt .
  28
     There may in general be more than one such surface, but we are ultimately interested in the area of such
a surface, and this value is unique. The fact that the area is bounded from above is tied to the fact that
we are looking for a surface which has only one dimension less than Bt ; lower dimensional surfaces could
achieve arbitrarily high area by “crumpling”. See also footnote 9.

A.1      Discrepancy in AdSd+1 for d ≥ 3

Now let us consider whether the construction Z provides a viable candidate for the dual
of the entanglement entropy. In order for the area of Z to be equal to the entanglement
entropy for general states, a minimal requirement is that Z reduces to the correct minimal
surface for static spacetimes. Therefore we wish to check whether in any static spacetime,
Z coincides with W (which, as we argued above, automatically coincides with X and Y for
all static spacetimes).
    We can find an easy counter-example, even for pure AdS, in more than three dimensions
for non-spherical regions. For simplicity, let us consider the infinite strip in AdS4 , in Poincaré
coordinates. The bulk metric is ds2 = z12 (−dt2 + dz 2 + dx2 + dy 2), and let the region A on
the boundary be an infinite strip extended along the y direction; {t = 0, x ∈ (−h, h)}. The
minimal surface is given by (5.18), with x(z) given by d˜ = 2 and smeared over all y. On
the other hand, the causal construction of Z outlined above is determined by past/future
directed null geodesics at constant y, from {z = 0, x = 0, t = ±h} into the bulk. Since
these are insensitive to the conformal factor of the bulk metric, they behave just as in flat
spacetime; the maximal area surface, lying on the intersection of the future and past light-
cones from the tips of D0 , is given simply by the half-circle z 2 +x2 = h2 , uniformly smeared in
the y-direction. We can easily check that this surface Z does not coincide with the minimal

surface W since Z does not satisfy29 (5.18). In particular, Fig. 12 demonstrates the difference
  29
       Note however that, remarkably, for a circular region A, the two surfaces Z and W would coincide

                                                  58
between the two surfaces. Moreover, we can easily check that the area of Z is much larger
than the area of W (since Z lies closer to the boundary where the warp factor diverges), so
the former cannot yield the entanglement entropy.
    The above discrepancy gets exacerbated in higher dimensions, where as d increases, the
solution to (5.18) becomes more separated from the curve Z, given by z 2 + x2 = h2 , which is
independent of d. In fact, in the more physically interesting case of AdS5 , we have an infinite
discrepancy between the area of Z and that of W. Here, we can actually compare our results
directly with a free Yang-Mills calculation, and check explicitly which surface yields a better
estimate of the entanglement entropy. In particular, the entropy density corresponding to
W, which coincides with the minimal surface considered in [10] (see Eq.(7.6) of that paper),
is given by                                                 

density and the AdS radius is set to unity. On the other hand, the entropy density associated
with Z can be easily computed to be

Note that apart from the standard 1/ε2 divergence, SZ also suffers from a logarithmic diver-
gence (related to the conformal anomaly), so that the discrepancy in the areas of Z and W
is actually infinite, though the leading divergence is the same.
    Now, to compare these gravity results with the Yang-Mills results, we consider the direct
free Yang-Mills computation. This leads to the following entropy density when we expressed
it in terms of AdS quantities [10]:
                                                                 

Of course, we do not expect the free Yang-Mills result to agree quantitatively with the AdS
gravity computation, since the latter corresponds to the strongly coupled gauge theory. Also
we cannot directly compare the divergent term since the UV cutoff in Yang-Mills calculation
is not necessarily equal to the one in the AdS side. However, we do expect that the finite
part of entropy should agree with each other semi-quantitatively as evidenced by the famous
4/3 entropy factor for the black D3-branes.30 Comparing (A.6) with (A.4) and (A.5), we
immediately see that the extremal surface W yields a much better approximation of the
entanglement entropy for the free Yang-Mills system than Z. We expect this to remain true
even at strong coupling.
exactly.

     In fact, it’s amusing to note that the ratio of the coefficients of the leading finite terms in the entangle-
ment entropy expressions (A.6) and (A.4) also lies very close to 4/3.

A.2    3-Dimensional static bulk geometries

Above we have seen that for AdSd+1 with d ≥ 3, the surface Z does not necessarily coincide
with the requisite minimal surface for static spacetimes. This a priori rules it out as a candi-
date covariant dual of entanglement entropy in time-dependent scenarios as well. However,
we may still ask whether in 3 dimensions the Z construction works better. After all, the
dual field theory lives in 2 dimensions, so we would expect many special properties. Indeed,
from the geometrical point of view, 3-dimensional bulk is special: since A is 1-dimensional,
Bt is always described simply by a light-cone. Moreover, performing the above check for
d = 2, we find that Z = W, since the surface z 2 + x2 = h2 satisfies (5.18).
   In fact, slightly less trivially, we can likewise check by explicit calculation that in global

both Z and W are given by

                                                      2 + r dϕ , Z and W likewise coincide

and are given by
                                                    cosh2 (r+ φ0 )
              r 2 (ϕ) = r+
                         2
                                                                                       .    (A.8)
                             sinh2 (r+ φ0 ) cosh2 (r+ ϕ) − cosh2 (r+ φ0 ) sinh2 (r+ ϕ)

   Let us therefore ask whether this agreement holds in general. Specifically, consider a
metric for a general static, spherically symmetric 3-dimensional spacetime,
                                ds2 = −f (r) dt2 + h(r) dr 2 + r 2 dϕ2                      (A.9)
which we take to be asymptotically AdS (f (r) → r 2 and h(r) → 1/r 2 as r → ∞). Let the
boundary region A be the same as above, A = { t = 0 , ϕ ∈ (−φ0 , φ0 ) }. We want to ask
whether Z and W coincide in this general static case. Note that W is simply a spacelike
geodesic anchored at ϕ = ±φ0 , whereas Z is the projection to t = 0 of a null geodesic
congruence from the tip of D0 .
    The effective potential for geodesics with energy E and angular momentum L, defined
by ṙ 2 + Veff (r) = 0, is given by
                                                          E2    L2
                                                                  
                                              1
                                  Veff (r) =        −κ −       + 2               (A.10)
                                             h(r)        f (r)  r
where κ = 0 for null geodesics and κ = 1 for spacelike geodesics. Since W corresponds to
the spacelike geodesic at constant t, pinned at ϕ = ±φ0 , we have κ = 1, E = 0, which fixes
the relation between L and φ0 . Also, the minimum radius reached rmin is easy to find from
Veff (rmin) = 0; we simply have rmin = L. Expressing W as ϕ(r), we then obtain
                                           Z r̄ r
                                                    h(r) 1
                               ϕ(r̄) = ±L                  dr .                     (A.11)

                                                   60
To construct Z, we consider a null geodesic congruence labeled by ℓ ≡ L/E (and we choose
parameterization such that E = 1). Then t and ϕ along the ℓ geodesic, written in terms of
r, are given by
                                      Z ∞s
                                                h(r)        r
                       tℓ (r̄) = φ0 −         2    2
                                                                 dr ,              (A.12)
                                            r − ℓ f (r) f (r)
                                                          p
                                        r̄
                                      Z ∞s                p
                                                h(r)       f (r)
                        ϕℓ (r̄) = ±ℓ                             dr .              (A.13)
                                       r̄  r 2 − ℓ2 f (r)   r
Now, let r0 (ℓ) be the value of r along the ℓ geodesic at which tℓ reaches zero, tℓ (r0 (ℓ)) = 0.
Then Z is given by ϕℓ (r0 (ℓ)), which as written is a parametric curve parameterized by ℓ,
but out of which ℓ should be eliminated to compare directly with A.11.
   To make progress, consider the change in ϕℓ as we vary r0 (i.e., as we vary ℓ):
                                              ∂ϕℓ (r0 (ℓ))
                             δϕℓ (r0 (ℓ))         ∂ℓ             ∂ℓ ϕℓ (r0 (ℓ))
                                          =                  =                            (A.14)
                               δr0 (ℓ)          ∂r0 (ℓ)              r0′ (ℓ)
                                                  ∂ℓ
which we can find using the generalized Leibnitz rule. We want to compare the resulting
expression with the corresponding variation for the spacelike geodesic W,
                                        r
                              dϕ(r)   L       h(r)
                                    =                   at r = r0 (ℓ) .                   (A.15)
                               dr      r r − L2
                                             2

We then obtain a long integral equation, which we can simplify (eliminate the integral) by
observing that ∂ℓ tℓ (r0 (ℓ)) = 0, which follows from the definition of r0 (ℓ); we can again use
the generalized Leibnitz rule to write this explicitly.
    Hence the assumption that Z = W reduces to the much simpler equation, which we wish
to verify/falsify for general f (r), and for all ℓ:
                                   r02 (ℓ) − ℓ2 f (r0 (ℓ)) = L2 .                         (A.16)
While it is straightforward to check that this mysterious relation does hold for the cases
discussed above of AdS and BTZ, as consistency demands, it is less trivial to check it for
general f (r). Resorting to numerical analysis, we find that unfortunately (A.16) is not
satisfied for arbitrary f (r) (although Z is typically well-approximated by W). Hence we
conclude that even in 3 dimensions, Z 6= W.
    To understand better why this is the case, consider the particular point on the surfaces Z
and W corresponding to ϕ = 0, namely when r reaches its minimal value. For the spacelike
geodesic W, this is simply L; whereas for Z, it corresponds to r0 (ℓ = 0) ≡ r0 . Therefore
a simple way to check that Z 6= W is to show that in general r0 6= L. We can extract the
relation between r0 and L by writing φ0 using the spacelike geodesic (A.11) and the null
geodesic (A.12) with ℓ = 0:
                            Z ∞s               Z ∞s
                                    h(r)                  h(r)
                       φ0 =               dr =              2       dr .               (A.17)
                             r0     f (r)       L     r 2 Lr 2 − 1

                                                  61
But this relation clearly indicates that whereas for any fixed φ0 , L depends only on h(r)
(since the spacelike geodesic at constant t cannot be sensitive to f (r)), r0 depends on both
h(r) and f (r) – so r0 cannot coincide with L for arbitrary f (r). This provides a proof that
Z 6= W for general 3-dimensional static spherically symmetric spacetimes.


A.3    Use of Z to bound the entanglement entropy

Above, we have described the construction Z and argued that it does not in general coincide
with X , Y, or W, even in static backgrounds. Hence, although Z is based only on causal
relations and therefore carries a certain appeal due to its simplicity, we may well ask what
is it useful for.
    In the context of entanglement entropy, we propose that computing Z is useful (if simpler
than computing W, Y, or X ) because it provides a bound on the entanglement entropy. In
particular, we expect that the area of Z is larger than (or equal to) the areas of W and Y,
at least for “sensible” spacetimes. If the spacetime is static, this is clearly true by definition
because the correct surface W = Y is the minimal area surface. In more general case,
one (3.7) of our covariant constructions, implies this speculation, though we cannot offer a
general proof.
    Imagine the situation where we want to find the minimal surface W = Y for a complicated
choice of the subsystem A in order to compute the holographic entanglement entropy in a
static higher dimensional spacetime. In this case, it seems almost impossible to find the
minimal surface analytically because we need to solve a partial differential equation with
a generic initial condition. However, to find null geodesics will be much more tractable.
Then we can find a definite and useful bound for the entanglement entropy by employing
the construction of Z.



B     Null expansions and extremal surfaces

B.1    Definition of extrinsic curvature

Consider a d-dimensional spacelike submanifold S in a D-dimensional spacetime M with
Lorentzian signature. The coordinates of M are denoted by xµ and those of the submanifold
S are ξ α .
                                          (m)                                           (m)
    We define the extrinsic curvature Kµν as follows. There are D − d vectors nµ (m =
1, 2, ..., D − d) on S which are orthogonal to S. The extrinsic curvature is defined by

                                        ∇µ nν(m) = Kµν
                                                    (m)
                                                        .                                     (B.1)



                                                62
In particular, if we choose a coordinate system adapted to S so that xµ = (ξ α, y l ), where
l = 1, 2, ..., D − d labels the directions normal to S, then we obtain
                                         (m)            (m)
                                       Kαβ = −Γlαβ nl         .                           (B.2)

Picking any two tangent vectors uµ , v µ ∈ T S, we can equivalently define the extrinsic cur-
vature by
                                (m) µ ν
                              Kµν    u v = (uµ ∇µ v ν ) nν(m) .                         (B.3)


B.2   Extremal surfaces

We define an extremal surface by the saddle point of the area functional
                                          Z       p
                               Area(S) = (dξ)d det g,                                     (B.4)
                                                 S

where gαβ is the induced metric and is written in terms of the total spacetime metric gµν as
             µ ∂X ν
gαβ = gµν ∂X
          ∂ξ α ∂ξ β
                    .
   After a little algebra, the equation of motion can be rewritten as

                                          Πµαβ g αβ = 0 ,                                 (B.5)

where Πµαβ is defined by

                        Πµαβ = ∂α ∂β X µ + Γµνλ ∂α X ν ∂β X λ − Γγαβ ∂γ X µ .             (B.6)

It is possible to show that Πµαβ is orthogonal to T S i.e., Πµαβ ∂γ Xµ = 0. Thus the only
                                                 (m)
independent components are D − d vectors nµ Πµαβ .
    Let us choose the specific coordinate system such that X µ = (ξ α , y l ) as before. Then it
is easy to see
                                                  (m)    (m)
                               nµ(m) Πµαβ = Γlαβ nl = −Kαβ .                               (B.7)
Thus we find that the extremal surface condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the trace
of the extrinsic curvature
                                     (m)
                             − g αβ Kαβ = g αβ nµ(m) Πµαβ = 0 .                        (B.8)
In a generic coordinate frame, this is expressed as

                                          g µν Kµν
                                                (m)
                                                    =0.                                   (B.9)




                                                 63
B.3    Expansions of null geodesics: relation to extremal surfaces

Consider a co-dimension two spacelike surface S. There are two independent normal vectors
at each point on S. We can choose them to be lightlike and call them N+µ and N−µ . They are
normalized such that N+µ N+µ = N−µ N−µ = 0 and N+µ N−µ = −1. We can define the extrinsic
             (±)
curvatures Kµν for these vectors.
    The two null expansions θ± are defined by

                                         θ± = g µν Kµν
                                                    (±)
                                                        .                              (B.10)
                                                                                 (±)
It is clear from the above definition of the extrinsic curvature that when g µν Kµν = 0 (i.e.,
S is a extremal surface), both of the expansions are zero θ± = 0.
   Also from this definition we can find that when N µ is a null Killing vector, i.e., ∇µ Nν +
∇ν Nµ = 0, the null expansion θ is obviously vanishing.



C     Details of perturbative analysis in Vaidya-AdS background

We perform a perturbative analysis by only keeping the linear order about the mass m(v)
in the Vaidya.
   We consider the extremal surface (or equivalently a geodesic) in the background (6.3)
assuming that m(v) is very small. At the boundary r = r∞ → ∞, the two end points of the
geodesic are given by (v, r, x) = (v0 , r∞ , ±h). We assume the following profile

   After we plug this into (6.10) and (6.11), we obtain the differential equations for the
perturbation s(x) and u(x) at linear order:
                                 √
       2x(h2 − x2 )3/2 s′ (x) − 2 h2 − x2 (2x2 + h2 )s(x) + x2 (h2 − x2 )m[v(x)] + 2ǫh = 0 ,
                                                                                        (C.2)

where, we have defined the very small quantity ǫ by
                                               1
                                          h=      +ǫ .                                  (C.4)

       Integrating (C.2), we obtain
                                                           Z x                  

Clearly we find s(0) = hǫ2 and this is consistent with (C.4). Notice also the property s(x) =
s(−x). To make sense of our perturbative argument, we need to require that s(x) does not
include the singular term ∼ (h − x)−3/2 when we take the limit x → h. This determines the
value of ǫ as follows:31
                                   1 h
                                      Z
                               ǫ=         dy m[v(y)] (h2 − y 2 ) .                      (C.6)
                                   2 0
The other function u(x) can be found by integrating (C.3) twice by using (C.5).
   After some analysis we can show that the UV cut-off r = r∞ is related to the UV cut-off
x = h − δ of x via                         ǫ 1
                                  δ = 1+          2
                                                    .                               (C.7)
                                            h 2h r∞
       The total geodesic length L is then found to be
                    Z h−δ                      Z h−δ

Explicit Calculations of Geodesic Length: Consider the following specific approxima-
tion to the time-dependent mass:

                                     m(v) = m(v0 ) + m′ (v0 )(v − v0 ).                               (C.9)

This is true when the time-dependence is small and is exact when the mass is linear function
of the time v. Further we assume the mass itself is also very small. Under these conditions
we obtain from (C.6)

          1 h
            Z                      √                     h3         3πh4 ′
     ǫ=        dx(m(v0 ) − m′ (v0 ) h2 − x2 )(h2 − x2 ) = m(v0 ) −      m (v0 ) .     (C.10)
          2 0                                            3           32

   With the specific profile (C.9), we can integrate (C.5) and (C.8) analytically. After a
somewhat lengthy computation we find
                                    
                                    2h     2            5π 3 ′
                      L(v0 ) = log       + h2 m(v0 ) −     h m (v0 ).               (C.11)

Substituting the relation (C.7) into (C.11), we obtain the final expression
                                                   1           π
                            L(v0 ) = 2 log(2hr∞ ) + h2 m(v0 ) − h3 m′ (v0 ).                         (C.12)
                                                   3           16

       When m is a constant this leads to ǫ = m
                                              3 h , which is consistent with our previous analysis in the BTZ
geometry.

The finite part of the geodesic length after we subtract the universal divergent piece 2 log(2h r∞ )
is now given by

In the case of the linear profile (or when m′′ (v0 ) is small enough) we find the geodesic length

Explicit form of s(x) and u(x): Under the assumption (C.9), we can find the following

Asymptotic Expansion of r(x) and v(x): From the previous explicit expression of s(x)

   On the other hand, the asymptotic expansion of v(x) in the limit x → h becomes

The first two terms represent the constant contribution v ≡ v(h) as considered in (6.8).
