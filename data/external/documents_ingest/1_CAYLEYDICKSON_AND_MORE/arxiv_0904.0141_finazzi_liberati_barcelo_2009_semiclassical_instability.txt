Warp drives are very interesting configurations in general relativity: At least theoretically, they
provide a way to travel at superluminal speeds, albeit at the cost of requiring exotic matter to exist
as solutions of Einstein’s equations. However, even if one succeeded in providing the necessary exotic
matter to build them, it would still be necessary to check whether they would survive to the switching
on of quantum effects. Semiclassical corrections to warp-drive geometries have been analyzed only
for eternal warp-drive bubbles traveling at fixed superluminal speeds. Here, we investigate the more
realistic case in which a superluminal warp drive is created out of an initially flat spacetime. First of
all we analyze the causal structure of eternal and dynamical warp-drive spacetimes. Then we pass to
the analysis of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a quantum field in these geometries.
While the behavior of the RSET in these geometries has close similarities to that in the geometries
associated with gravitational collapse, it shows dramatic differences too. On one side, an observer
located at the center of a superluminal warp-drive bubble would generically experience a thermal
flux of Hawking particles. On the other side, such Hawking flux will be generically extremely high
if the exotic matter supporting the warp drive has its origin in a quantum field satisfying some form
of quantum inequalities. Most of all, we find that the RSET will exponentially grow in time close
to, and on, the front wall of the superluminal bubble. Consequently, one is led to conclude that the
warp-drive geometries are unstable against semiclassical backreaction.

INTRODUCTION

Since Alcubierre introduced them [1], warp drives have
been certainly one of the most studied spacetime geometries among those requiring exotic matter for its existence
(see [2] for a recent review about “exotic spacetimes”).
They were immediately recognized as interesting configurations for two main reasons. First, they provide, at least
theoretically, a way to travel at superluminal speeds: A
warp drive can be described as a spheroidal bubble separating an almost flat internal region from an external
asymptotically flat spacetime with respect to which the
bubble moves at an arbitrary speed. The idea is that
although on top of a spacetime nothing can move with
speeds greater than that of light, spacetime itself has no
a priori restriction on the speed with which it can be
stretched. Second, they provide an exciting ground for
testing our comprehension of general relativity (GR) and
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (for instance
when investigating warp-drive implications for causality
[3]).
In its original form [1] the warp-drive geometries are
described by the simple expression

the center of the bubble and v0 the warp-drive velocity.
Here and thereafter v = v0 f (r) with f a suitable smooth
function satisfying f (0) = 1 and f (r) → 0 for r → ∞.
After the warp-drive spacetimes were proposed, the
most investigated aspect of them has been the amount
of exotic matter (i.e. energy-conditions-violating matter)
that would be required to support them.1 It was soon
realized that this was not only related to the size of the
warp-drive bubble but also determined by the thickness
of the bubble walls [6]. It was found that, if the exoticity was provided by the quantum nature of a field,
satisfying therefore the so-called quantum inequalities
(QI),2 then the violations of the energy conditions would
have to be confined to Planck-size regions, making the
bubble-wall thickness ∆ to be, accordingly, of Planck
size [∆ ≤ 102 (v0 /c) LP , where LP is the Planck length].
However, it can be shown that very thin walls require
very large amounts of exotic matter: e.g., in order to
support a warp-drive bubble with a size of about 100 m
and propagating at v0 ≈ c, one would need a total negative energy |E| ≫ 1011 M⊙ .3 Perspectives for warp-drive

1 While initially it was supposed that exotic matter was needed

only for superluminal warp drives (v0 > c), it was later recognized [4, 5] that energy-conditions-violating matter is needed
also for subluminal speeds. This points out that the need of
exotic matter is peculiar of the warp-drive geometry itself, not
appearing only in the superluminal regime.
2 See [7] for a review about quantum inequalities applied to some
exotic spacetimes.
3 If one could somehow avoid the QI, then it would be possible to

2
engineering can be improved by resorting to a modified
warp-drive configuration with a reduced surface area but
the same bubble volume [8]. The total amount of negative energy required to support these warp drives becomes quite small (for example, |E− | ≈ 0.3M⊙ for a 100
m-radius bubble, although one has to add as well some
positive energy outside the bubble E+ ≈ 2.5M⊙ ), bringing the warp drive closer to a realistic solution albeit still
far from foreseeable realizations.
Regarding the feasibility of warp-drive configurations,
a parallel line of research has focused on the study of their
robustness against the introduction of quantum corrections to GR. In particular, in [9] it was studied what
would be the effect of having semiclassical corrections in
the case of an eternal superluminal warp drive. There,
it was noticed that to an observer within the warp-drive
bubble, the backward and forward walls (along the direction of motion) look, respectively, like the horizon of
a black hole and of a white hole. By imposing over the
spacetime a quantum state which is vacuum at the null
infinities (i.e., what one may call the analog of the Boulware state for an eternal black hole) it was found that
the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) diverges
at the horizons.4 Independently of the availability of exotic matter to build the warp drive in the first place, the
existence of a divergence of the RSET at the horizons
would be telling us that it is not possible to create a
warp-drive geometry within the context of semiclassical
GR: Semiclassical effects would destroy any superluminal warp drive. However, in a more realistic situation,
a warp drive would have to be created at a very low velocity in a given reference frame and then accelerated
to superluminal speeds. One may then expect that the
quantum state globally defined on such dynamical geometry would be automatically selected by the dynamics
once suitable boundary conditions are provided (e.g., at
early times). This is indeed the case for a gravitational
collapse where it can be shown that, whenever a trapping horizon forms, the globally defined quantum state
that is vacuum on I − has to be thermal at I + (at the
Hawking temperature) and regular at the horizon. In
other words, the dynamics of the collapse avoids selecting a Boulware-like state, with its associated divergence
at the horizon, ending up instead selecting the analogous for collapsing configurations of the Unruh vacuum
state defined on eternal black holes, which leads to a perfectly regular RSET. Is the dynamics of the creation of
a warp drive, with its associated selection of the global
vacuum state, able to avoid the presence of divergences in
the RSET? Indeed, in [9] it was already noticed that an
Unruh-like state rather than a Boulware-like state should
be expected to describe the quantum state characterizing

a superluminal warp-drive creation.
In this paper we want to settle this issue by explicitly
considering the case of a warp drive which is created with
zero velocity at early times and then accelerated up to
some superluminal speed in a finite amount of time. This
can be viewed as the warp-drive analog of a semiclassical
black hole collapse [10]. By restricting attention to warp
drives in 1 + 1 dimensions (since this is the only case for
which one can carry out a complete analytic treatment),
we have calculated the RSET in the warp-drive bubble.
As we were expecting, we find that in the center of the
bubble there is a thermal flux of particles at the Hawking temperature corresponding to the surface gravity of
the black horizon. However, the surface gravity can be
shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the
bubble walls which, as said, has to be of the order of the
Planck length if some form of QI holds. Hence, one has
to conclude that an internal observer would soon find itself in the uncomfortable condition of being swamped by
a thermal flux at the Planck temperature. Even worse,
we do show that the RSET does increase exponentially
with time on the white horizon and close to it (while
it is regular and small on the black one). This clearly
implies that warp drives would become rapidly unstable
once superluminal speeds are reached.
The plan of the paper is the following. In Sec. II we
study the causal structure of both an eternal and a dynamic warp drive. In Sec. III we discuss the propagation
of light rays in a dynamical warp-drive geometry in close
analogy with the standard treatment for black holes.5
Finally, in Sec. IV we calculate the full RSET using the
technique adopted in [10] for black hole formation and
look for its divergences. A summary of our results is
given in Sec. V.

II. CAUSAL STRUCTURE OF A
SUPERLUMINAL WARP DRIVE

We investigate the causal structure of a warp drive,
following the method presented in [12], for spacetimes
whose metrics can be written in Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates. We begin from an eternal warp drive, moving
at constant velocity, and then we study a dynamic situation in which a warp-drive bubble is accelerated.

built warp drives with much larger wall thickness. For example,
for ∆ ≃ 1 m, one would only need |E| & 1/4 M⊙ .
4 Throughout this paper we shall work in the Heisenberg representation so that only operators, not the states, evolve in time.

5 A similar result was found by González-Dı́az [11].

Here r is defined as the signed distance from the center
of the bubble, r ≡ x− v0 t. Again we define v(r) = v0 f (r)
but f is now taken to be defined also for negative values of
r. Its boundary conditions will be f (0) = 1 and f (r) → 0
for r → ±∞. For illustrative purposes, let us choose the
following simple bell-shaped function:

and v0 > c, that is, our warp drive is superluminal. We
want to stress that all the results of this paper do not
depends on the particular choice of the function f . They
are still valid providing that it satisfies the above conditions. We have chosen a particular form for it just for
simplicity. Now, by using (t, r) coordinates the metric
Eq. (2) reads
2

ds2 = −c2 dt2 + [dr − v̄(r)dt] ,

v̄(r) = v(r) − v0 .
(4)
Note that v̄ < 0 because the warp drive is right going
(v > 0) but v(r) ≤ v0 .
By definition, at any time the center of the bubble is
located at r = 0. The causal structure of this metric can
be analyzed following [12]. Let us define the warp-drive
Mach number α ≡ v0 /c. The shift velocity becomes

diverges logarithmically. Integrating these equations we

accelerating the bubble from an initial zero velocity. In

noticed for the positions of r1 and r2 , in a general situation in which f is not symmetric, the two surface gravities

will soon show that these two horizons represent a black
and a white horizon, respectively. Here on, we will consider the two surface gravities to have the same absolute
value. Retaining different absolute values will not lead
to more general results, but will just make the notation
heavier.

the total spacetime. The dashed lines signal the locations
at which the geometry can be extended. The two external regions r > r2 and r < r1 appear to an observer living
inside the bubble as an eternal white hole and an eternal
black hole, respectively. For this reason, we call H1+ and
H2− , respectively, the black horizon and the white horizon of the warp drive. Notice however that for the inner
observers in an eternal configuration, at r1 there is also
a white horizon [HC− (t = −∞, r = r1 ) in the diagram]
and at r2 a black horizon [HC+ (t = +∞, r = r2 ) in the
diagram]. The geometry can be extended through these
two null lines. We do not picture the extended regions
as there are ambiguities in the prescription of the matter
distribution in those other “universes.”7

Now we can bring the right and left infinities to a finite
distance by using a compactifying transformation like

multiply the velocity derivative by c to get an acceleration. However we use this slightly modified definition to avoid the appearance of too many constant c factors in our formulas.

Dynamic superluminal warpdrive

What happens to the causal structure when we consider the creation of a superluminal warp drive starting
from initially flat spacetime? For concreteness, we study
a simple case in which we reach the final velocity v = v0
at a finite time which we take to be t = 0. We modify

Kerr spacetimes this problem is not present as one considers only
vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations.

ds2 = −c2 dt2 + [dr − v̂(r, t)dt] ,
v̂(r, t) = v0 δ(t) [f (r) − 1]

(31)

and the apparent horizons associated with the t slicing
are found by setting v̂ = −c. In this case a solution does
not exist for any value of t, so that the apparent horizons are created at infinity at some finite tH . We show
this below. Let us write the equation for the apparent
horizons in the following form:
f (r) = 1 −

c
.
v0 δ(t)

(32)

The function f takes all the values between 0 and 1. In
particular, f (r) → 0 for r → ±∞ and f (0) = 1. Besides,
the right-hand side of Eq. (32) is a monotonic function
of t, such that, for t → −∞, 1 − c/ (v0 δ(t)) → −∞
and reaches the value 1 − c/v0 > 0 for t ≥ 0. As a
consequence, there exists a time tH < 0 so that for t > tH
there are always two solutions of Eq. (32), corresponding
to a black and a white horizon. These horizons are born
at t = tH at spatial infinity and at t = 0 they settle at
two fixed positions r1 and r2 .
Keeping these points in mind, we are able to build the
Penrose diagram for the dynamic warp drive (Fig. 3).
At early times the metric is approximately Minkowskian,
because δ(t) → 0 for t → −∞. Therefore, the causal
structure is initially Minkowskian. Then, it progressively
changes till t = 0. At this time one has built a stationary
warp drive, just as in the previous section. After this
time, the Penrose diagram looks exactly equal to that in
Fig. 2. The final Penrose diagram is just obtained by

gluing together the two behaviors. Again, we are not
drawing an analytically extended diagram but only the
relevant patch for the analysis that follow in this paper.
Given that a timelike observer can reach HC+ and HR+
in a finite proper time, the geometry can be extended in
the future, beyond these lines. This is actually a subtle point. In fact, HC+ and HR+ (which are linked to
the formation of a white horizon) are on the boundary
of the Cauchy development of I − . In this sense, they
are Cauchy horizons given that initial data are assigned
only on I − . Hence, as noticed in Sec. II A, an eventual
extension would not be unique. In any case such an extension will not be relevant for what will follow, given
that we shall limit ourselves to investigating the asymptotic behavior of the RSET associated with the onset of
the superluminal warp drive.
Let us highlight here that the dynamic way we have
used here to create the warp drive is not the only possible
way. In Appendix A, we will also use a different interpolation between Minkowski and the warp drive in which
the horizons appear also at finite time but at finite r
positions (similar to what happens when a homogeneous
star collapses to form a black hole).

III.

LIGHT-RAY PROPAGATION

The just discussed causal structure of the dynamical
warp drive is naturally leading to the expectation that
some sort of Hawking radiation will be produced in a su-

6
perluminal warp drive (as well as some transient particle
emission). It is well known (see, for example, [13]) that
all the information about particle production is encoded
in the way in which light rays propagate in a spacetime.
That is, it is enough to know how light rays are bended
in order to analyze the phenomenon of particle creation.
In the dynamical warp drive there is a single past null
coordinate but three different future null coordinates associated with the final regions I, II and III, as described
before. From here on, we will be dealing exclusively with
the connection between the past null coordinate U at IL−
and the future null coordinate uII at HC+ in the interior
of the bubble. Therefore, we will use u to denote uII
whenever this does not lead to confusion. As discussed
in [14] the relation U = p(u) encodes all the relevant
information about particle production.
We want to study the features due to the two main
properties of a dynamical warp-drive geometry, i.e., the
spacetime is Minkowskian at early times and it is a warp
drive at late times. In particular, we are not interested
in the transient features depending on how the transition between these two regimes is performed. Namely, we
need only the behavior close to the horizons and at late
times inside the whole bubble. It is clear from Fig. 3 that,
if one stays at constant r inside the bubble and moves
forward in time one crosses u rays which pass closer and
closer to the black horizon. Therefore, once we have determined the behavior of p(u) close to the horizons,8 we
automatically also have the required information at late
times in the whole bubble.
In general, the relation U = p(u) is obtained by integrating the differential equation for the propagation of
right-going light rays

(33)

Note that while in the previous section we considered a
specific form of v̂(r, t) [Eq. (31)] in order to discuss the
causal structure of the associated spacetime, here (and in
what will follow) the discussion will hold for any v̂(r, t)
that satisfies the requirements v̂(r, t) → 0, for t → −∞
(sufficiently rapid for the spacetime to be asymptotically
flat), and v̂(r, t) = v̄ after some finite time and within
the warp-drive bubble. Given the assumption that the
spacetime settles down to a stationary warp-drive configuration, at late times the velocity profile will depend
only on the r coordinate. We can write, as in the stationary case Eq. (7)
du = dt −

To find the required asymptotic relation one has to integrate this equation in the limit r → r1,2 . There, the

and is regular in the whole spacetime, in particular, on
the horizons. For instance, on a fixed t slice in the stationary region, we can write U as a regular function of
r
U± = U± (r − r1,2 ) ,

(38)

where we denoted with U+ (respectively, U− ) the specific
form of U close to the black (respectively, white) horizon,
and U± are analytic functions. Inserting Eq. (36) in the
above expression, at the same fixed time,
U± = p(u → ±∞) = P± (e∓κu ) ,

(39)

where P± are again analytic functions. Note that the
forms of these functions do not depend on the particular time slice chosen to perform the matching between
Eqs. (36) and (38). In the proximity of the stationary
horizons u → ±∞, so e∓κu → 0 and the function p can
be expanded around the horizons. Up to the first order
we get

U = p(u → ±∞) = U BH ∓ A± e∓κu + O e∓2κu , (40)
WH

where A± are positive constants.
This is indeed the asymptotic behavior one would expect in the presence of trapping horizons and, for the
black hole case, it is the standard relation between u and
U . In fact, it leads to the conclusion that an observer
at I + will detect Hawking radiation with temperature
κ/2π. It is important to note that the result is completely
general. The asymptotic behavior of U = p(u) for large
absolute values of u, which is the only feature of p(u) relevant for the analysis of this paper, does not depend on
the specific velocity profile adopted. It is only necessary
that it interpolates from Minkowski spacetime at early
times to a stationary warp-drive geometry at late times.
While Eq. (40) is exactly of the expected form, its implications for particle production are not as straightforward as in the black hole case. In fact, in the warp-drive
geometry the late-time modes labeled by u will not be
standard plane waves in an asymptotically flat region of
spacetime as they will be characterized by the strange
form given in Eq. (36). Of course, if the surface gravity
κ is large enough so that the typical wavelength of the

7
emitted radiation is much smaller than the bubble size,
then the plane-wave approximation is fine and in the center of the bubble, at late times, one will measure standard
Hawking radiation at temperature T . Nonetheless, in the
general case, even if the calculation for the Bogoliubov
coefficient is the standard one [13], the particles created
will not be standard plane waves. The physics associated with the particle production by the white horizon
is even less clear. This is why, in the next section, we
shall consider the behavior RSET to get more significant
information.
In order to do so, we shall also need the relation between ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. In fact, these
modes are excited too when the warp drive forms, even
if we do not have a thermal particle production as for
right-going modes. Left-going rays are the solution of
the following differential equation [see Eq. (33)]:
dr
= −c + v̂(r, t) .

Looking at Fig. 3, we note that left-going rays do not see
the horizons, that is, they cross them from IR− to IL+ .
As a consequence, both the past and the future null coordinates W and w are defined at the asymptotic region
outside the bubble. However, after the geometry inside
the bubble has settled down to its final stationary form,
we can define, just for convenience, a different coordinate
w̃ inside the bubble, as in Eq. (8):
(42)

Note that w and w̃ may or may not coincide depending on
how fast the metric in the external region settles down to
its final stationary form (refer to Fig. 4 and Appendix A
for an example in which they do not coincide).

are formed at TH = 1. Please refer to Appendix A for details.

(43)

The relation W = q(w̃) can be found explicitly for specific
cases (see Appendix A). The important point is that one
can prove that this relation is always regular, so that
it cannot give place to any phenomenon like Hawking
radiation. Of course, one can choose a very unusual way
to interpolate from Minkowski to the warp drive, such
that a lot of particles are created in this sector, but this
is not a general feature of dynamical warp drives. If we
use a regular enough transition, only transient effects are
present in this sector. In Appendix A, we shall show that
it is possible to find such a transition.
As an example, in Fig. 4 we plot both right-going and
left-going light rays propagating in the particular dynamic warp-drive spacetime analyzed in Appendix A.

RENORMALIZED STRESS-ENERGY
TENSOR

For the calculation of the RSET inside the warp-drive
bubble we can use the method used in [10] for a collapsing
configuration to form a black hole. In null coordinates U
and W , affine on I − , the metric can be written as
ds2 = −C(U, W )dU dW .

(44)

As we described in the previous section, in the out region (the region in which the metric is stationary, i.e.,
v̄ depends only on r) we can also use a different set of
null coordinates u, w̃. The coordinate u is affine on HC+
and w̃ is the coordinate defined in Eq. (42). In these

8
coordinates the metric is expressed as
ds2 = −C̄(u, w̃)dudw̃ ,

(45)

which implies
C(U, W ) =

C̄(u, w̃)
,
ṗ(u)q̇(w̃)

(46)

and
U = p(u),

W = q(w̃) .

(47)

These transformations are such that the C̄ has precisely
the form of the future stationary warp-drive geometry,
that is, it depends only on r through u, w̃.
For concreteness let us refer to the RSET associated
with having a single quantum massless scalar field living
on the spacetime. In this case the RSET components
have the following form [13]:

Qualitatively, things would not change if there were other
fields present in the theory. The only modification will
be that the previous expressions will get multiplied by
a specific numerical factor. It is clear that in the in region (where the spacetime is Minkowskian) the RSET is
trivially zero.
Now, for a metric in the form of Eq. (44), the curvature
can be calculated as in [13]:

that the following expressions are obtained from Eqs. (34)
and (42), so they are valid only when the velocity profile

depends only on the r coordinate. In this fashion, we can
study the stress-energy tensor at the end of the creation
of the warp drive (or at the end of a collapse if we are
studying a black hole).

One can check that these quantities do not diverge at the

whether it remains small or not as time increases.
In particular, it is interesting to look at the energy

We want to study what happens to a spaceship placed
at rest in the center of the bubble to investigate whether a
warp drive can be used as a transportation device. Moreover we want to check whether the components of the
RSET in a regular coordinate system are regular at the
horizons. Freely falling observers are at rest in the center
of the bubble but left moving otherwise.
Looking at the above expressions for any component
of the RSET or at the energy density ρ, we see that they
can be split as a sum of three terms, one purely static,
depending only on the r coordinate through the shift
velocity v̄, and two dynamic pieces depending also on
the u and w̃ coordinates, respectively. They correspond
to energy traveFling on right-going and left-going light
rays, respectively, eventually red/blue-shifted by a term
depending on r. Being interested in studying the energy
density measured by free-falling observers, we write
ρ = ρst + ρdyn−u + ρdyn−w̃ ,

(71)

where we defined static terms (labeled by subscript st)
and dynamic terms (labeled by subscript dyn) for each
component. Right-going and left-going terms are respectively labeled by u and w̃.

Let us start with ρdyn−w̃ . Its denominator is bounded for
each r because the shift velocity is negative, and its numerator is vanishing with time. It is easy to convince oneself that all the contributions to the RSET coming from
the w̃ sector are not universal but depend exclusively on
the specific interpolation between the early Minkowski
spacetime and the final warp-drive spacetime. It is always possible to choose an interpolation so that all these
contributions vanish at late times (see Appendix A).
From now on, we neglect the dynamic term ρdyn−w̃
and study
ρ ≃ ρst + ρdyn−u .

RSET at the center of the warp-drive bubble

We shall now study the behavior of the RSET in the
center of the bubble at late times. In this point v̄(r =
0) = v̄ ′ (r = 0) = 0 and the static term ρst vanishes.
By integrating Eq. (34) in the stationary region, one can
show that u(t, r) is linear in t so that, for fixed r, it
will acquire arbitrarily large positive values (see Fig. 3).
The dynamic term in Eq. (73) can be evaluated by using
a late-time expansion of p(u) [see Eqs. (40) and (C2)],
then plugged in Eq. (69). This is derived in Appendix C
and it is equal to

the warp-drive bubble will indeed observe thermal radiation at the temperature TH .

Let us move now to study ρ close to the horizons. Note
that both ρst and ρdyn−u are divergent at the horizons
(r → r1,2 ) because of the (1 + v̄) factors in the denominator. Just like in [10], for a black hole, these diver-

where C± are constants. We can easily see that the behavior close to the black horizon is completely different
from that close to the white horizon. In the former case
the energy density as seen by a free-falling observer is
damped exponentially with time. In the white horizon,
however, this energy density grows exponentially with
time. This means that, moving along H2− , ρ is large and
negative diverging while approaching the crossing point
between H2− and HC+ .
This asymptotic divergence is physical and not a matter of selection of coordinates. In a very short time after
the white horizon is formed (of the order of 1/κ), the
backreaction of the RSET in this region of spacetime is
no longer negligible but rather very strong.

(84)

(85)

Keeping in mind this point, let us study the term ρdyn−u ,
at fixed u, when time increases. There is a time at which
the u ray will be close enough to r2 , such that the denominator in Eq. (73) can be approximated by
2

2

(1 + v̄) ≃ κ2 (r2 − r) ,

(86)

which becomes, thanks to the previous result,
2

(1 + v̄) ∝ e−2κt ,

(87)

such that, for t → +∞, ρ diverges along every single
u ray as e+2κt , because of the blueshift factor (1 + v̄)2 .
Hence, ρ will diverge on the whole line HC+ , which is

11
a Cauchy horizon for the geometry (so this result does
not contradict the Fulling-Sweeny-Wald theorem [15]).
We then deduce that the warp-drive spacetime is again
likely to become unstable in a very short time.
As a closing remark, it is perhaps important to stress
that this divergence of the RSET on the Cauchy horizon is of different nature with respect to the one found
in Sec. IV B. In fact, the divergence of Sec. IV B is intrinsically due to the inevitable transient disturbances
produced by the formation of the horizon. In this sense
it is a new and very effective instability present every
time a white horizon is formed in some dynamical way.
On the contrary, the just found divergence on HC+ can
be seen as due to the well-known infinite blueshift suffered by light rays as they approach a Cauchy horizon, in
this specific case as due to the accumulation of Hawking
radiation produced by the black horizon. In this sense it
is not very different from the often claimed instability of
inner horizons in Kerr-Newman black holes [16, 17, 18].
Of course the divergence and the appearance of the
horizon HC+ would be avoided if the superluminal warp
drive were sustained just for a finite amount of time. In
that case, no Cauchy horizons would arise and no actual
infinity would be reached by the RSET. However, the
latter would still become huge in a very short time, increasing exponentially on a time scale 1/κ ≈ ∆/c, where
∆ is the thickness of the warp-drive bubble. Note that,
in order to get a time scale of even 1 s, one would need
∆ ≈ 3 × 108 m.

V.

SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have described the causal structure of both eternal and dynamical warp drives. In a geometric optics
approximation we have studied the propagation of light
rays in dynamical geometries and found that the same exponential relation between affine coordinates on I − and
HC+ is recovered at late times (large u) as in the case
of black hole spacetimes. Given this relation it is unavoidable the conclusion that indeed a Hawking flux will
be observed by any observer inside the warp-drive bubble far from the black horizon. Indeed, the calculation
shows explicitly the onset of such a flux. This radiation
is produced at the black horizon and soon fills the interior of the bubble, traveling rightward at the speed of
light. The central region of the warp drive behaves like
the asymptotic region of a black hole: In both these regions the static contribution (ρst ) to the energy density
vanishes so that the total energy density is due solely to
the Hawking radiation generated at the black horizon.
When creating a warp drive one not only forms a black
horizon but also a white one. Both are sources of rightgoing radiation. To understand better the nature of this
radiation we have calculated the RSET in this geometry and, in particular, the energy density as measured
by freely falling observers. In this way we recover that
the RSET does not diverge at the horizons at any finite

time. The singular behavior of the static terms (or vacuum polarization terms) in the RSET at the horizons is
canceled by the leading contributions of the dynamical
right-going terms, or what is equivalent, by the presence
of Hawking radiation at both the horizons.
It is however easy to see that the subleading terms of
Eq. (83) behavior is rather different between the black
and the white horizons. The subleading term in the
RSET associated with the formation of the black horizon does not produce any significative backreaction on
the horizon itself. In fact, this term is just a transient
which decays exponentially.9
The formation of a white horizon is also associated
with a similar subleading term, but this time it accumulates onto the white horizon itself. This causes the
energy density ρ seen by a free-falling observer to grow
unboundedly with time on this horizon. The semiclassical backreaction of the RSET will make the superluminal
warp drive become rapidly unstable, in a time scale of
the order of 1/κ2 , the inverse of the surface gravity of
the white horizon. Indeed, if one trusted the QI [6, 8],
the wall thickness for v0 ≈ c would be ∆ . 102 LP , and
the surface gravity κ & 10−2 tP −1 , where tP is the Planck
time.10 This means that the time scale over which the
backreaction of the RSET would become important is
τ ∼ 1/κ . 102 tP . Indeed, even forgetting about the QI,
in order to get even a time scale τ ∼ 1 s for the growing
rate of the RSET, one would need a wall as large as 3×108
m. Therefore, most probably one would be able to maintain a superluminal speed for just a very short interval of
time. In addition to the above mentioned growing term
on H2− we have shown that there is also an unbounded
accumulation of Hawking radiation on HC+ . Also this
contribution will very rapidly lead to a significant backreaction on the superluminal warp drive and to some sort
of semiclassical instability of the solution (that will most
probably prevent the formation of the Cauchy horizons
at late times).
Interestingly, recent investigations [19] seem to imply that the above found asymptotic divergences of the
RSET on the white horizon might disappear if Lorentz
symmetry gets broken at high energies. While in this
case we still expect that the RSET will acquire large values soon after the white horizon is formed, we do not
know if this would be enough to prevent the sustainabil-

9 Furthermore, the analogy with a black hole originated by a star

collapse of [10] also allows us to infer that the warp drive must
be created very rapidly in order to avoid a huge accumulation of
vacuum polarization at the horizon and so a huge initial value of
the energy density.
10 In 1 + 1 dimensions the warp-drive configuration is actually a
vacuum solution of Einstein equations. In this case, QI will not
impose any conditions on the size of the wall thickness. However,
as we will show, we expect our results to be valid also in 3 + 1
dimensions. Therefore, we use the wall thickness of 3 + 1 warp
drives to obtain a realistic estimation for the Hawking temperature and the time scale of the exponential growing of the RSET.

12
ity of the warp drive. We think that this issue could be
subject for future research perhaps within the context of
analog models of gravity (see [20] for a complete review
on analog models) where it might even be addressed experimentally.
Even if the above described semiclassical instability
could be avoided by some external action on the warpdrive bubble (or by some appropriate UV completion of
the quantum field theory, like in [19]), the QI lead to
the conclusion that the Hawking radiation in the center
of the bubble will burn the internal observer with an
excruciating temperature of TH ∼ κ & 10−2 TP , where
TP is the Planck temperature, about 1032 K. This would
prevent the use of a superluminal warp drive for any kind
of practical purpose. If we do not trust the QI, this high
temperature might be avoided by making thicker walls.
For instance, with ∆ ∼ 1 m, one obtains a temperature
of about 0.003 K (roughly the temperature of radiation
at a wavelength of 1 m).11
Finally we want to comment on the fact that in this
paper a 1+1 calculation was performed. Generally in
spherically symmetric spacetimes this could be seen as
an s-wave approximation to the correct results. However, this is not the case for the axisymmetric warp-drive
geometry. However, we do expect that the salient features of our results would be maintained in a full 3+1
calculation (most probably a numerical one) given that
they will still be valid in a suitable open set of the horizons centered around the axis aligned with the direction
of motion.
In conclusion, we think that this work is casting strong
doubts about the semiclassical stability of superluminal
warp drives. Of course, all the aforementioned problems
disappear when the bubble remains subluminal. In that
case no horizons form, no Hawking radiation is created,
and neither strong temperature nor white horizon instability is found. The only remaining problem is that one
would still need the presence of some amount of exotic
matter to maintain the subluminal drive.

APPENDIX A: AN EXAMPLE OF DYNAMICAL
WARPDRIVE

In this Appendix we want to present a model of dynamical warpdrive, which we used for numerical calculation. It is particularly useful because it allows one to
carry out an almost complete analytical treatment. We
adapt here the method presented in [14, 21] for stellar
collapses to the creation of a warp drive from Minkowski
spacetime. We can choose a simplified piecewise velocity
profile, which has the relevant properties of a dynamical
warp drive, i.e., it describes a flat geometry at early times
and coincides with the metric in Eq. (4) after some finite
time t > 0.
Using our velocity profile defined in Eq. (5)
v̄(r) = αc [f (r) − 1] ,

(A1)

we can define a dynamical profile by replacing v̂ in
Eq. (31) by v̂kink

v̄(ξ(t))
if |r| ≥ ξ(t) ,
v̂kink (r, t) =
(A2)
v̄(r)
if |r| < ξ(t) ,
where ξ(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t,
such that ξ(t) → 0, for t → −∞, and ξ(tH ) = r2 = −r1 .
One may wonder whether defining a velocity profile
with a kink, as in Eq. (A2), may lead to unphysical phenomena. Indeed this computational trick induces some
spurious effects, but these features are just transients and
do not affect the results at late times.

Right-going rays

We apply the same procedure of [14] to calculate the
exact relation between the past null coordinate U in IL−
and the future null coordinate relevant at HC+ . To find
this relation one has to find the integral curves of the ray
differential equation (33), which becomes at early times
dr

and in a neighborhood of HC+ (t → +∞ and r → r2 , see

We now want to find the relation between U and u. It
is possible to find a particular form for the kink function
ξ (see Fig. 4 and its caption for an example), such that all
the rays cross either the left kink r = −ξ(t) or the right
kink r = +ξ(t) only once. The event ”crossing the kink”
can be seen as belonging to both the in region and the
out region. Therefore the relation U = p(u) can be found
by eliminating t0 and r0 between expressions (A10) and
(A13) taking into account that r0 will be either −ξ(t0 )
or +ξ(t0 ). Figure 4 shows an exact numerical calculation
of ray propagation, performed with this method.

function ξ can be expanded in the following form:

with λ a positive constant (remember that we have chosen for simplicity r1 = −r2 ). Defining

However, in order to study the late-time behavior of
both particle production and the RSET, we only need the
previous relation (see Sec. III) for large and positive values of u (the location of the black horizon) and for large
and negative values of u (the location of the white horizon). We want to show here that our particular example
leads in fact to the general relation Eq. (40). In this specific case, taking the limit for |u| → ∞ corresponds to
study the previous relation for light rays crossing the left
kink at r0 = −ξ(t0 ), when r0 is very close to r1 [respectively, crossing the right kink at r0 = +ξ(t0 ), when r0
is very close to r2 ]. First note that, when t → tH (the
time of the first appearance of the trapping horizons) the

crossing the kink close to to r1 ]. By expanding Eq. (A13)
in the same limit t0 → tH and retaining only the dominant term we obtain

Left-going rays

In Sec. IV we stated that it is possible to find a wide
class of transitions from a Minkowskian geometry to a
warp-drive one such that the contributions to the RSET
due to left-going modes are just transient, vanishing at
late times. We show here that this is the case for our
specific model.
In order to do so, we shall need the relation between
ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. Left-going rays are
the solution of the differential equation (41) which becomes at early times
dr
= −c ,
dt

(A20)

while inside the bubble we cannot take any limit as in
Eq. (A4) because left-going rays are not confined inside
the bubble, but escape through the black horizon, as we
already noticed in Sec. III. Integrating the equation at
early times we obtain
t=C−

(A21)

We identify initial events P ≡ (ri , ti ), with ri ∼ cti , final
events Q ≡ (rf , tf ), and intermediate events O ≡ (r0 , t0 )
either in the in region (when the velocity profile depends
only on t) or in the out region (when the velocity profile
depends only on r).
Using w̃ defined as in Eq. (42), choosing arbitrarily the
constant of integration, we obtain

This is a constant value greater than 0. As a consequence, all the derivatives of q̇ go to zero as time grows
and ρdyn−w̃ must go to zero in the same way. In conclusion, the dynamic term originated by the distortion of
left-going rays can be different from zero when the horizon is created. However, this is only a transient term that
is brought toward IL+ , i.e., outside the bubble. That is,
it is possible to create a transition region such that some
radiation traveling leftward is produced only at the onset
of the warp drive, but there is not any phenomenon like
Hawking radiation originated in this way.
APPENDIX B: NULL COORDINATES

In this Appendix we summarize some results concerning systems of null coordinates. In Sec. III we defined two
sets of null coordinates (U, W ) and (u, w̃) obtained by integrating equations of light propagation, respectively, in
the in region, in which the metric is Minkowskian, and in
the out region, in which it depends on r (after the kink,
in the particular example of Appendix A). Now, let us
rewrite the metric using the set of coordinates (u, w̃). In
the out region, using Eqs. (34) and (42):
1

c + v̄(r)
ut = 1 ,

ur = −

Now, the relation W = q(w̃) can be found eliminating
t0 , r0 from Eqs. (42) and (A25) in the limit where (t0 , r0 )
is on the kink.
We can now show that indeed the term ρdyn−w̃ defined
in Eq. (74) is just a transient for this model. We see from
Fig. 4 that, as time grows, points inside the bubble are
reached by w̃ rays that intersect the kink later and later.
Using Eqs. (42) and (A25) we can estimate q̇, calculating

ds2 = −C̄(u, w̃)dudw̃
= −C̄(u, w̃) (ut dt + ur dr) (w̃t dt + w̃r dr)

By comparison with Eq. (31) we obtain
C̄(u, w̃) = c2 − v̄(r)2 ,

(B3)

Note that the definition of U and W can be extended
in the out region by following the light rays coming from
the in region (in the model of Appendix A by matching
on the kink the solutions of U and W with those of u
and w̃). For instance, one can naturally define U (t, r) in
the out region as U (t, r) = p (u(t, r)) and in analogous

15
ways for the other null coordinate. This means that it
makes sense to take derivatives of the null coordinates
with respect to r and t in all the spacetime. We write
here the derivatives of U and W in the out region:
ṗ(u)

c + v̄(r)
Ut = ṗ(u)ut = ṗ(u) ,

Ur = ṗ(u)ur = −
