                                                 Motivated by the space of spinors on a Lorentzian manifold, we define Krein spectral triples, which
                                                 generalise spectral triples from Hilbert spaces to Krein spaces. This Krein space approach allows for an
                                                 improved formulation of the fermionic action for almost-commutative manifolds. We show by explicit
                                                 calculation that this action functional recovers the correct Lagrangians for the cases of electrodynamics,
                                                 the electro-weak theory, and the Standard Model. The description of these examples does not require
                                                 a real structure, unless one includes Majorana masses, in which case the internal spaces also exhibit a
                                                 Krein space structure.

                                          1      Introduction
                                          The framework of Connes’ noncommutative geometry [Con94], and in particular the special case of so-called
                                          almost-commutative manifolds [ISS04], can be used to derive physical models describing both gravity and
                                          (classical) gauge theory, thus providing a first step towards a unified theory. For a suitably chosen almost-
                                          commutative manifold, one obtains the full Standard Model of high energy physics, including the Higgs
                                          mechanism and neutrino mixing [Con96, CCM07]. This unified description of gauge theory and gravity
                                          relies on two action functionals which allow to derive the Lagrangian of the theory: the spectral action
                                          [CC97] and the fermionic action [Con06]. The spectral action yields the bosonic part of the Lagrangian,
                                          while the fermionic action yields (of course) the fermionic part (including the interactions between fermions
                                          and bosons).
                                              In this article we will focus on the fermionic action. The usual fermionic action, given by Connes [Con06],
                                          is given for a real even spectral triple (A, H, D, J, γ) of KO-dimension 2 as
                                                                                                         1 e       e
                                                                                                 Sf :=     hJ ξ | Dξi,
                                                                                                         2

                                          where ξe is a Grassmann variable corresponding to an even vector ξ = γξ ∈ H+ . While the Lagrangian
                                          obtained from this action closely resembles (term by term) the physical Lagrangian, there are still two
                                          discrepancies. First, the fermionic action is given in Riemannian signature, while physical spacetime has

                                                                                                           1
Lorentzian signature. Second, the fermionic action is defined by using the real structure (the ‘charge con-
jugation operator’), but (except for possible Majorana mass terms) the charge conjugation operator should
not be present in the physical Lagrangian. In addition, the presence of this real structure also means that
the fermionic action is not automatically real-valued.
    In this article we will consider a Lorentzian version of noncommutative geometry. The study of Lorentzian
noncommutative geometry is still far from complete, although some progress has been made. While the
spinors on a Riemannian manifold give rise to a Hilbert space, the spinors on a pseudo-Riemannian (e.g.
Lorentzian) manifold naturally give rise to a Krein space instead. Thus, to obtain a physical description of
spinor fields on spacetime, it is more natural to work with Krein spaces instead of Hilbert spaces. A Krein
space approach to noncommutative geometry was first taken in [Str06] and studied further in [Sui04, PS06].
Building upon these previous works, we propose a definition of Krein spectral triples, which offers a natural
extension of the notion of spectral triples from Hilbert spaces to Krein spaces.
    Subsequently, we will describe a Lorentzian alternative to the fermionic action, which we call the Krein
action. As observed by Barrett [Bar07], the Krein action can be chosen to simply take the form of the usual
Dirac action, and is given by
                                                 SK [ψ] := hψ|Dψi,
where h·|·i denotes the indefinite inner product on a Krein space H, and D is an unbounded Krein-self-adjoint
operator on H. Thus, this action by construction allows for Lorentzian signatures, and it does not involve
the charge conjugation. Unlike Barrett, however, we avoid the introduction of anti-commuting Grassmann
variables for the fermions, which we find more natural, as an almost-commutative manifold only describes
a classical gauge theory (not a quantum theory). Another difference is that, when Majorana masses are
included, our finite space also exhibits a Krein space structure (see Section 6.1).
    In [NW96], a continuous Wick rotation for spinor fields has been introduced, which could be used to turn
the Krein action into a Euclidean action. Although a detailed study of such Wick rotations falls beyond
the scope of this article, we would like to point out that such a Wick rotation of our Krein action cannot
correspond to Connes’ fermionic action, due to the presence of the charge conjugation operator in the latter.
    Lastly, let us point out that our description of gauge theories in terms of Krein spectral triples is not yet
complete, as we have no Krein alternative for the bosonic action. It is still very much an open question how
the spectral action should be adapted to the Lorentzian setting.
    The layout of this article is as follows. First, we describe in Section 2 the definition of Krein spectral
triples and the Krein action. We develop the general formalism for describing gauge theories from almost-
commutative Lorentzian manifolds in Sections 3 and 4. Subsequently, we will calculate the Krein action
explicitly for the cases of electrodynamics (Section 5), the electro-weak theory (Section 6), and the Standard
Model (Section 7). In these examples we will see that (unless one wants Majorana masses) it is not necessary
to include the ‘anti-particles’ in the finite Hilbert space. Majorana masses can be added by including these
‘anti-particles’ (i.e. by doubling the finite Hilbert space), and by turning this doubled space into a Krein
space (see Section 6.1).

2    Krein spectral triples
A Krein space is a vector space H with a non-degenerate inner product h·|·i which admits a fundamental
decomposition H = H+ ⊕ H− (i.e., an orthogonal direct sum decomposition into a positive-definite subspace
H+ and a negative-definite subspace H− ) such that H+ and H− are intrinsically complete (i.e., complete
with respect to the norms kψkH± := |hψ|ψi|1/2 ).



                                                       2
    A fundamental symmetry J is a self-adjoint unitary operator J : H → H such that (1 + J )H is positive-
definite and (1 − J )H is negative-definite. Given a fundamental decomposition H = H+ ⊕ H− , we obtain a
corresponding fundamental symmetry J = P + − P − , where P ± denotes the projection onto H± . Given a
fundamental symmetry J , we denote by HJ the corresponding Hilbert space for the positive-definite inner
product h·|·iJ := hJ · |·i.
    For an operator T , we will denote by T + the Krein-adjoint (i.e., the adjoint operator with respect to the
Krein inner product h·|·i). By the adjoint T ∗ we will mean the usual adjoint in the Hilbert space HJ (i.e.,
with respect to the positive-definite inner product h·|·iJ ). These adjoints are related via T + = J T ∗ J . For
a detailed introduction to Krein spaces, we refer to [Bog74].
Definition 2.1. A Krein space H with fundamental symmetry J is called Z2 -graded if HJ is Z2 -graded
and J is homogeneous.
    The assumption that HJ is Z2 -graded means we have a decomposition H0 ⊕ H1 , and that this decom-
position is respected by the positive-definite inner product h·|·iJ (which means that hψ0 |ψ1 iJ = 0 for all
ψ0 ∈ H0 and ψ1 ∈ H1 ). The bounded operators B(H) then also decompose into a direct sum of even oper-
ators B 0 (H) and odd operators B 1 (H). The assumption that the fundamental symmetry J is homogeneous
means that J is either even or odd. If J is odd, it implements a unitary isomorphism H0 ≃ H1 . Given the
decomposition H0 ⊕ H1 , we have a (self-adjoint, unitary) grading operator Γ which acts as (−1)j on Hj (for
j ∈ Z2 ). If J is odd, we note that Γ is Krein-anti-self-adjoint (indeed, Γ+ = J ΓJ = −ΓJ 2 = −Γ).
    As in [DR16, §2.1] we define the ‘combined graph inner product’ h·|·iS,T of two closed operators S and
T as hψ|φiS,T := hψ|φiJ + hSψ|SφiJ + hT ψ|T φiJ (using the positive-definite inner product h·|·iJ ), for all
ψ, φ ∈ Dom S ∩ Dom T . This inner product yields the corresponding ‘combined graph norm’ k · kS,T . For
a Krein-self-adjoint operator D we have J D∗ = DJ and Dom D∗ = Dom DJ = J · Dom D. One can then
check that h·|·iD,D∗ is identical to h·|·iDJ ,J D on Dom D ∩ Dom D∗ = Dom D ∩ J · Dom D.
    The following definition aims to adapt the notion of spectral triple to Krein spaces. Similar approaches
for such an adaptation have been given in [PS06, Str06]. Our definition is similar to the notion of indefinite
spectral triple from [DR16], except for the addition of the fundamental symmetry, and the replacement of
the conditions on Re D and Im D by the Krein-self-adjointness of D. We will focus only on the even case;
the odd case is defined similarly by removing the Z2 -grading.
Definition 2.2. An even Krein spectral triple (A, H, D, J ) consists of
   • a Z2 -graded Krein space H;
   • a trivially graded ∗-algebra A along with an even ∗-algebra representation π : A → B 0 (H);
   • a fundamental symmetry J (satisfying J ∗ = J and J 2 = 1) which commutes with the algebra A and
     which is either even or odd;
   • a densely defined, closed, odd operator D : Dom D → H such that:
       1) the linear subspace E := Dom D ∩ J · Dom D is dense in H;
       2) the operator D is Krein-self-adjoint on E (or, equivalently, the operator J D : Dom D → HJ is
          self-adjoint);
       3) we have the inclusion π(A) · E ⊂ E, and the commutator [D, π(a)] is bounded on E for each a ∈ A;
       4) the map π(a) ◦ ι : E ֒→ H → H is compact for each a ∈ A, where ι denotes the natural inclusion
          map E ֒→ H, and E := Dom D ∩ J · Dom D is considered as a Hilbert space with the inner product
          h·|·iDJ ,J D .
We say an even Krein spectral triple (A, H, D, J ) is of Lorentz-type when J is odd.
    The assumption that the fundamental symmetry commutes with the algebra need perhaps not be ne-
cessary in the general noncommutative case, but it will be satisfied by all examples we consider. This
assumption ensures that we have π(a)+ = π(a)∗ = π(a∗ ) for all a ∈ A.
    We have aimed to give a ‘complete’ definition for Krein spectral triples, which can be used as a framework
for the study of Lorentzian noncommutative geometry. However, this framework will undoubtedly undergo


                                                       3
further transformations, and the above definition may not be definitive. We point out that, for the description
of the fermionic action, only conditions 2. and 3. for the operator D are relevant. Nevertheless, we will show
that the almost-commutative manifolds constructed in Section 4 satisfy all conditions, also for non-compact
manifolds (i.e., non-unital algebras).
    As follows from Proposition 4.1 below, the assumption that J is odd actually just captures the fact that
the number of time dimensions is odd; it does not necessarily imply that there is only one time dimension
(as was noted already in [PS06, page 5]).
    A quadratic form on a Krein space H is a sesquilinear map q : Dom q × Dom q → C (conjugate-linear in
the first variable and linear in the second variable), where the form domain Dom q is a dense linear subspace
of H. If q(ψ1 , ψ2 ) = q(ψ2 , ψ1 ) for all ψ1 , ψ2 ∈ H we say that q is symmetric. If H = H0 ⊕ H1 is Z2 -graded
(and we think of C as being trivially graded), then we say that q is Z2 -graded if q(ψ0 , ψ1 ) = 0 for any
ψ0 ∈ H0 ∩ Dom q and ψ1 ∈ H1 ∩ Dom q.
Proposition 2.3. Let (A, H, D, J ) be an even Krein spectral triple. Then

                                    F (ψ1 , ψ2 ) := hψ1 |Dψ2 i = hJ ψ1 |Dψ2 iJ

defines a symmetric quadratic form F with form domain Dom F = Dom D. Moreover, if the Krein spectral
triple is of Lorentz-type, then F is Z2 -graded.
Proof. Sesquilinearity is immediate from the definition, and using the Krein-self-adjointness of D we also
find symmetry: hψ1 |Dψ2 i = hDψ2 |ψ1 i = hψ2 |Dψ1 i. If the triple is of Lorentz-type, then the grading
operator Γ is Krein-anti-self-adjoint. For ψ0 ∈ H0 ∩ Dom D and ψ1 ∈ H1 ∩ Dom D we then find that
hψ0 |Dψ1 i = hΓψ0 |Dψ1 i = −hψ0 |ΓDψ1 i = hψ0 |DΓψ1 i = −hψ0 |Dψ1 i.
Definition 2.4 (Krein action). Let (A, H, D, J ) be a Lorentz-type spectral triple. We define the Krein
action SK : H0 → C to be the functional

                                         SK [ψ] := F (ψ, ψ) = hψ|Dψi.

Since F is a symmetric quadratic form, the Krein action SK [ψ] is automatically real-valued. Furthermore, we
will show in Sections 5, 6 and 7 that this Krein action recovers the correct (fermionic part of the) Lagrangians
for electrodynamics, the electro-weak theory, and the Standard Model.


3    Gauge theory
In this section, we develop the abstract formalism for a description of gauge theories using Krein spectral
triples. Later, we will apply this to the special case of almost-commutative manifolds.
    Let A be a trivially graded unital ∗-algebra. Denote by Aop := {aop | a ∈ A} the opposite algebra of
A, which equals A as a vector space but has the opposite product aop bop = (ba)op . Let H be a Z2 -graded
Krein space with fundamental symmetry J , and suppose we have two commuting even representations
π : A → B 0 (H) and π op : Aop → B 0 (H). For ease of notation, we will often simply write a instead of π(a)
and aop instead of π op (aop ). We obtain a representation of the algebraic tensor product A ⊙ Aop on H by
setting π̃(a ⊗ bop ) := π(a)π op (bop ). Now suppose that (A ⊙ Aop , H, D, J ) is a Krein spectral triple. We say
that this triple satisfies the order-one condition if
                                                                    
                                               π(a), [D, π op (bop )] = 0                                     (1)

for all a, b ∈ A. In the remainder of this section we consider an even Krein spectral triple (A ⊙ Aop , H, D, J ).
We will assume that this triple is unital, which means that A is unital and that π̃ is unital. The examples
we describe in Sections 5-7 all satisfy the order-one condition. However, the order-one condition can fail in
other examples, such as the Pati-Salam model [CCS13a], and therefore we will develop the abstract formalism
below without assuming that the triple satisfies the order-one condition.


                                                        4
3.1     Inner perturbations
We will now introduce fluctuations of the operator D, which will give rise to gauge fields as well as scalar
fields (the latter being interpreted as the Higgs field in the case of electroweak theory and the Standard
Model, see Sections 6 and 7). We adapt the approach described in [CCS13b] to our Krein spectral triples.
     Let A be a trivially
                  P       graded unital ∗-algebra, and consider the algebraic tensor product P  A ⊙ Aop . For
an element A = j aj ⊗ bj ∈ A ⊙ A , we have an anti-linear involution A → A given by j aj ⊗ bop
                            op         op
                                                                                                         j :=
P ∗       ∗op
    bj ⊗ aj , with the properties (λA) = λ A, A = A, and (AA ) = A A , for all λ ∈ C and A, A ∈ A ⊙ Aop .
                                                                  ′       ′                      ′
                   P                                                                           P
We say that A = j aj ⊗ bop  j ∈ A⊙ A
                                      op
                                         is real 1 if A = A, and we say that A is normalised if aj bj = 1 ∈ A.
The properties of reality and normalisation are preserved by multiplication, so we can define the following.
Definition 3.1 ([CCS13b, §III]). The perturbation semi-group Pert(A) is the set of real normalised elements
in A ⊙ Aop , with the multiplication inherited from the algebra A ⊙ Aop .
    Let (B, H, D, J ) be a Krein spectral triple. We consider the generalised one-forms given by
                                                nX                         o
                                    Ω1D (B) :=      aj [D, bj ] aj , bj ∈ B ,

where the sums must converge in norm. For the algebra B = A⊙Aop , we then consider a map ηD : A⊙Aop →
Ω1D (A ⊙ Aop ) ⊂ B(H) defined by
                           X                X                                        
                        ηD      aj ⊗ bop
                                      j    :=   π̃(aj ⊗ (a∗k )op ) D, π̃(bj ⊗ (b∗k )op ) .
                                   j                  j,k

As in [CCS13b, Lemma 4.(ii)], this map ηD is involutive (i.e. ηD (A) = ηD (A)+ ). In particular, ηD maps
elements of Pert(A) to Krein-self-adjoint elements in Ω1D (A ⊙ Aop ). If we have a Krein spectral triple
(A ⊙ Aop , H, D, J ) which satisfies the order-one condition (1), then the expression for ηD simplifies to
                                X              X                  X ∗op

                                            j   =     aj [D, bj ] +  aj [D, b∗op
                                                                              j ].
                                       j                    j               j

Definition 3.2. By the fluctuation of D by A ∈ Pert(A) we mean the map
                                                  D 7→ DA := D + ηD (A),
and we refer to DA as the fluctuated Dirac operator.
   We point out that the map ηD is not multiplicative and therefore it does not yield a representation of
the semi-group Pert(A) on H. Instead, we obtain an action of Pert(A) on the space of fluctuated Dirac
operators.
Proposition 3.3 ([CCS13b, Proposition 5.(ii)]). A fluctuation of a fluctuated Dirac operator is again a
fluctuated Dirac operator. To be precise: (DA )A′ = DA′ A for all perturbations A, A′ ∈ Pert(A).

3.2     Gauge action
The unitary group U(A) maps to the perturbation semi-group Pert(A) via the semi-group homomorphism
∆ : U(A) → Pert(A) given by u 7→ u ⊗ (u∗ )op . This then yields
                                                           P     an obvious action of u ∈ U(A) on Pert(A)
given by multiplication with ∆(u). To be precise, for A = j aj ⊗ bopj ∈ Pert(A), the action of u ∈ U(A) is
given by                             X                      X
                            ∆(u)A =      uaj ⊗ (u∗ )op bop
                                                        j =     uaj ⊗ (bj u∗ )op .
                                              j                         j

   1 In [CCS13b], A (denoted A∗ therein) is called the adjoint of A, and real elements are called self-adjoint. However, since

A 7→ A is an involution instead of an anti-involution, we prefer to think of this map as a ‘real structure’, which turns the
complex algebra A ⊙ Aop into a “real” algebra (following terminology of Kasparov [Kas80]).


                                                                5
Since Pert(A) ⊂ A ⊙ Aop , we can compose ∆ with the ∗-algebra representation π̃ to obtain a group repres-
entation
                                      ρ := π̃ ◦ ∆ : U(A) → B(H).
Definition 3.4. We define the gauge group as
                                       
                              G(A) := ρ(u) | u ∈ U(A) ≃ U(A)/ Ker ρ.
   We also consider an action γ of the unitary group U(A) on Ω1D (A ⊙ Aop ). For T ∈ Ω1D (A ⊙ Aop ) and
u ∈ U(A), this action is given by
                     γu (T ) := ρ(u)T ρ(u∗ ) + ηD ◦ ∆(u) = ρ(u)T ρ(u∗ ) + ρ(u)[D, ρ(u∗ )].
We point out that this is the usual transformation of gauge potentials under the gauge group G(A). The
map ηD is covariant with respect to the actions by U(A) (cf. [CCS13b, Lemma 4.(iii)]). To be precise,
γu ◦ ηD (A) = ηD (∆(u)A) for all u ∈ U(A).
    As mentioned above, we have an action of G(A) on H. We can also define an action of G(A) on the space
of fluctuated Dirac operators. For ρ(u) ∈ G(A), this action is given by DA 7→ D∆(u)A . If u ∈ Ker ρ, then
ηD (∆(u)A) = ηD (A) and hence D∆(u)A = DA . Therefore this action of ρ(u) on DA is independent of the
choice of representative u ∈ U(A) for ρ(u) ∈ G(A).
Proposition 3.5. The Krein action SK [ψ, A] := hψ|DA ψi of the fluctuated Dirac operator DA is invariant
under the action of the gauge group given by ψ 7→ ρ(u)ψ and A 7→ ∆(u)A.
Proof. Since ηD is covariant under the action of the gauge group, we find
           D∆(u)A = D + ηD (∆(u)A) = D + γu ◦ ηD (A) = D + ρ(u)ηD (A)ρ(u∗ ) + ρ(u)[D, ρ(u∗ )]
                                   
                  = ρ(u) D + ηD (A) ρ(u∗ ) = ρ(u)DA ρ(u∗ ).
Since the unitary ρ(u) commutes with J (so ρ(u) is also unitary for the Krein inner product), we find
         SK [ρ(u)ψ, ∆(u)A] = ρ(u)ψ | D∆(u)A ρ(u)ψ = ρ(u)ψ | ρ(u)DA ψ = hψ | DA ψi = SK [ψ, A].


4    Almost-commutative manifolds
A finite space F := (AF , HF , DF , JF ) with Z2 -grading ΓF is an even Krein spectral triple for which HF
is finite-dimensional. An almost-commutative manifold is then constructed as the product of a finite space
with a pseudo-Riemannian spin manifold M . Let us first have a closer look at the Krein spectral triple
corresponding to such a manifold.
     Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional time- and space-oriented pseudo-Riemannian spin manifold of signature
(t, s), where t is the number of time dimensions (for which g is negative-definite) and s is the number of
spatial dimensions (for which g is positive-definite). We consider an orthogonal decomposition of the tangent
bundle T M = Et ⊕ Es , which always exists but is far from unique. We will consider elements of Et to be
‘purely timelike’ and elements of Es to be ‘purely spacelike’. Given our choice of decomposition T M = Et ⊕Es ,
we have a timelike projection T : Et ⊕ Es → Et and a spacelike reflection r := 1 − 2T which acts as (−1) ⊕ 1
on Et ⊕ Es . Using the spacelike reflection r, we can define a ‘Wick rotated’ metric gr on M by setting
                                             gr (v, w) := g(rv, w)
for all v, w ∈ T M . One readily checks that gr is positive-definite, and hence (M, gr ) is a Riemannian
manifold.
    Let Cl(T M, g) denote the real Clifford algebra with respect to g, and denote the Clifford representation
T M ֒→ Cl(T M, g) by γ. Our conventions are such that γ(v)γ(w) + γ(w)γ(v) = −2g(v, w). We shall denote
by h the map T ∗ M → T M which maps α ∈ T ∗ M to its dual in T M with respect to the metric g. That is:
                               h(α) = v ⇐⇒ α(w) = g(v, w)      for all w ∈ T M.

                                                      6
We assume that M is equipped with a spin structure. We consider the corresponding spinor bundle S → M
and its space of compactly supported, smooth sections Γ∞    c (S). We denote by c the pseudo-Riemannian
Clifford multiplication Γ∞c (T ∗
                                 M ⊗ S) → Γ ∞
                                            c (S) given by c(α ⊗ ψ) := γ h(α) ψ. Let ∇ be the Levi-Civita
connection for the pseudo-Riemannian metric g, and let ∇S be its lift to the spinor bundle. The Dirac
operator on Γ∞c (S) is defined as the composition
                                                    S
                                                ∇               c
                                     / : Γ∞
                                     D          −→ Γ∞
                                          c (S) −
                                                        ∗
                                                                → Γ∞
                                                    c (T M ⊗ S) −  c (S).

Locally, we can choose a (pseudo-)orthonormal frame {ej }nj=1 corresponding to our choice of decomposition
T M = Et ⊕ Es , such that ej ∈ Et for j ≤ t and ej ∈ Es for j > t. In terms of this frame, the metric can be
written as
                                                                 (
                                                                   −1 j = 1, . . . , t;
                   g(ei , ej ) = δij κ(j),                κ(j) =
                                                                   1     j = t + 1, . . . , n.

Let {θi }ni=1 be the basis of T ∗ M dual to {ej }nj=1 , so that θi (ej ) = δji . We then see that h(θj ) = κ(j)ej . In
terms of the local frame {ej }, we can then write the Dirac operator as
                                                           n
                                                           X
                                         / := c ◦ ∇S =
                                         D                       κ(j)γ(ej )∇Sej .
                                                           j=1

Given the decomposition T M = Et ⊕ Es , there exists a positive-definite hermitian structure [Bau81, §3.3.1]
                                    (·|·)JM : Γ∞        ∞         ∞
                                               c (S) × Γc (S) → Cc (M ),
                                                      R
which gives rise to the inner product hψ1 |ψ2 iJM := M (ψ1 |ψ2 )JM dvolg , for all ψ1 , ψ2 ∈ Γ∞
                                                                                              c (S), where dvolg
denotes the canonical volume form of (M, g). The completion of Γ∞    c (S) with respect to this inner product
is denoted L2 (S). We can define an operator JM on L2 (S) by setting
                                           JM := it(t−1)/2 γ(e1 ) · · · γ(et ),
where {ej } is a local orthonormal frame corresponding to the decomposition T M = Et ⊕ Es . This operator
is self-adjoint and unitary, and is related to the spacelike reflection r via JM γ(v)JM = (−1)t γ(rv). The
space L2 (S) then becomes a Krein space with the indefinite inner product h·|·i := hJM · |·iJM and with
fundamental symmetry JM . This indefinite inner product h·|·i is independent of the choice of decomposition
T M = Et ⊕ Es .
Proposition 4.1. Let (M, g) be an n-dimensional time- and space-oriented pseudo-Riemannian spin man-
ifold of signature (t, s). Let r be a spacelike reflection, such that the associated Riemannian metric gr is
complete. Then we obtain an even Krein spectral triple
                                                                    
                                           Cc∞ (M ), L2 (S), it /
                                                               D, JM ,
with grading operator ΓM . If t is odd, the triple is a Lorentz-type spectral triple.
Proof. We need to check that it D    / satisfies the conditions of Definition 2.2. For condition 1. we note that
the linear subspace E := Dom D     / ∩ JM · Dom D  / contains Γ∞ c (S) and is therefore dense in H. Condition 2.
follows from [Bau81, Satz 3.19]. Condition 3. follows because D     / is a first-order differential operator and the
algebra is smooth.
    To show the local compactness of the inclusion map E ֒→ L2 (S), we consider the ‘Wick rotations’ D           / ± :=
1 /       ∗    i /      ∗
2 (D + /
       D    )∓ 2 (D − /
                      D   ). We know  from (the  proof of) [DR16,  Proposition  4.2] that D/ ± are elliptic, and hence
they have locally compact resolvents (see e.g. [HR00, Proposition 10.5.2]). The equality of the combined
graph norms k · kD,D∗ = k · kD+ ,D− (see [DR16, Lemma 2.3]) shows that the inclusion E ֒→ Dom D                  / ± is
bounded, and therefore the composition E ֒→ Dom D        / ± ֒→ L2 (S) is locally compact.
    Since M is even-dimensional, we have a grading operator ΓM which satisfies the relation ΓM JM =
(−1)t JM ΓM (see e.g. [LM89, Ch. 1]). This implies that we have a Lorentz-type spectral triple if and only if
t is odd.

                                                            7
   Let H be a Z2 -graded Krein space. For a homogeneous element ψ ∈ Hj (j = 0, 1), we write |ψ| = j for
the degree of ψ. Similarly, for a homogeneous operator T on H, we have |T | = 0 if T is even, and |T | = 1 if
T is odd.
   Given two Z2 -graded Krein spaces H1 and H2 , we define their graded tensor product H1 ⊗    ˆ H2 as the
vector space H1 ⊗ H2 with the inner product

                                      hψ1 ˆ        ˆ φ2 i := hψ1 |φ1 ihψ2 |φ2 i,

                                                                      ⊗ H2 )0 := (H10 ⊗              ˆ H21 ) and

(H1 ⊗ H2 ) := (H1 ⊗ H2 ) ⊕ (H1 ⊗ H2 ). Given homogeneous operators T1 on H1 and T2 on H2 , their tensor
product acts on H1 ⊗ ˆ H2 as

                                (T1 ⊗         ˆ ψ2 ) := (−1)|T2 ||ψ1 | T1 ψ1 ⊗
                                    ˆ T2 )(ψ1 ⊗                              ˆ T2 ψ2 ,

for homogeneous elements ψ1 ∈ H1 and ψ2 ∈ H2 . The adjoint of T1 ⊗

Definition 4.2. Let (M, g) be an even-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spin manifold as in Proposition 4.1.
An almost-commutative pseudo-Riemannian manifold F × M is the product of a finite space F with the
manifold M , given by
                                                                                                           

                                           ˆ ΓM .
equipped with the grading operator Γ := ΓF ⊗
    As in [BD14], we construct almost-commutative manifolds as F × M instead of M × F (though the latter
is more common in the literature). The reason is that the order F × M is more natural for the generalisation
to the globally non-trivial case and its description as a Kasparov product (see [BD14, §III.C]). Here we have
also written the product in terms of the graded tensor product ˆ  ⊗, thus avoiding explicit use of the grading
operators.
Proposition 4.3. An almost-commutative pseudo-Riemannian manifold is an even Krein spectral triple.
Proof. The factor i|JF |·|JM | in front of JF ˆ
                                              ⊗JM ensures that J is again self-adjoint and unitary. Furthermore,
J commutes with the algebra A because JF and JM both commute with the algebra. Since JF and JM
are homogeneous, J is also homogeneous with degree |J | = |JF | + |JM |. The factors i|JF | and i|JM | before
1ˆ⊗ it D
       / and DF ⊗ 1 (respectively) ensure that D is again Krein-symmetric. The Krein-self-adjointness of D
then follows from Krein-self-adjointness of it D  / and boundedness of DF . The other properties of D follow
straightforwardly from the properties of D    / and DF .

   Our typical example will be an almost-commutative manifold constructed from an even-dimensional
Lorentzian manifold, which is of course of Lorentz-type (for which JM is odd). In order to be able to apply
the Krein action, we need this almost-commutative manifold to be of Lorentz-type as well, which means
that the finite space should not be of Lorentz-type. Hence we impose the restriction that JF is even. The
almost-commutative manifold is then of the form

5      Electrodynamics
As a first example, we will calculate the Krein action for electrodynamics. The model of electrodynamics
was first studied in the context of noncommutative geometry in [DS13]. Here, we take a slightly different


                                                           8
approach, since we have no need for a real structure, and we can therefore reduce the dimension of the
Hilbert space by a factor 2.
   We consider the algebra AF = C ⊕ C, and the even finite space
                                                                          
                                       op         2          0 −im
                        FED := AF ⊙ AF , HF = C , DF =               , JF = 1 .
                                                            im 0

We denote the standard basis of HF as {eR , eL }, where eR is odd and eL is even. Since AF is commutative,
we have Aop                                                       op             0
         F ≃ AF = C ⊕ C. We consider the representations π, π : C ⊕ C → B (HF ) given by

                            π(λ, µ) := λ,                             π op (λ, µ) := µ,

for (λ, µ) ∈ C ⊕ C, which gives the representation π̃((λ, µ) ⊗ (λ′ , µ′ )) = λµ′ of AF ⊙ Aop F on HF . We also
note that these representations obviously satisfy the order-one condition (1). Since we have set JF = 1, this
finite space is in fact an ordinary finite spectral triple, and hence also a Krein spectral triple which is not of
Lorentz-type.
Proposition 5.1. The gauge group of the finite space FED equals G(FED ) = U (1).
Proof. We have U(AF ) = U (1) × U (1), and the kernel of the representation ρ : U(AF ) → B(HF ) equals
Ker ρ = {(λ, λ) ∈ U(AF ) | λ ∈ U (1)} ≃ U (1), which yields for the quotient G(FED ) = U(AF )/ Ker ρ ≃
U (1).
    Let (M, g) be an even-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spin manifold as in Proposition 4.1, for which t
is odd, and consider the corresponding almost-commutative manifold as in Eq. 2:
                                                                                       
                FED × M := Cc∞ (M, AF ⊙ Aop          ˆ 2        ˆ t/        ˆ      ˆ
                                             F ), HF ⊗ L (S), 1 ⊗ i D + iDF ⊗ 1, 1 ⊗ JM .

     In the following, we will use local coordinates xµ (µ = 1, . . . , n = t + s) to write the Dirac operator as
D = γ µ ∇Sµ for the ‘gamma matrices’ γ µ := γ(dxµ ) and the spin connection ∇Sµ = ∇S∂µ .
 /
     We consider a perturbation A ∈PPert(Cc∞ (M, AF )). Since the algebra A := Cc∞ (M, AF ) is commutative,
   op
A ≃ A and we can write A =             aj ⊗ bj for aj = (λj , µj ) and bj = (λ′j , µ′j ) in A. Since the order-one
condition is satisfied, the expression for ηD simplifies and takes the form
                                      X                    X
                             ηD (A) =            / λ′j ] +
                                          λj [it D,                 / µ′j ] =: Aµ ⊗
                                                             µj [it D,            ˆ it γ µ ,
                                       j                 j
                                                                                                 P
where we have used that DF commutes with the algebra elements, and we have defined Aµ := j (λj ∂µ λ′j +
µj ∂µ µ′j ) ∈ Cc∞ (M ). Since A is real and ηD is involutive (cf. [CCS13b, Lemma 4.(ii)]), we know that ηD (A)
is Krein-self-adjoint. Since it γ µ is Krein-anti-symmetric, Aµ must also be Krein-anti-symmetric, and hence
Aµ ∈ Cc∞ (M, iR). We consider the corresponding fluctuated Dirac operator given by

                                            ˆ it D
                                    DA := 1 ⊗                     ˆ it γ µ .
                                                         ˆ 1 + Aµ ⊗
                                                 / + iDF ⊗                                                    (3)

    The almost-commutative manifold FED × M is of Lorentz-type, and hence we can apply Definition 2.4
                                                       ˆ L2 (S)0 ⊕ HF1 ⊗
for the Krein action. An arbitrary vector ξ ∈ H0 = HF0 ⊗               ˆ L2 (S)1 can be written uniquely as

                                                   ˆ ψR + eL ⊗
                                            ξ = eR ⊗         ˆ ψL ,                                           (4)

for Weyl spinors ψL ∈ L2 (S)0 and ψR ∈ L2 (S)1 . Note that the vector ξ ∈ H0 is therefore completely
determined by one Dirac spinor ψ := ψL + ψR .
Proposition 5.2. The Krein action for FED × M is given by

                                   SED [ψ, A] = ψ | (it (D
                                                         / + γ µ Aµ ) − m)ψ .


                                                        9
Proof. We need to calculate the inner product hJ ξ|DA ξiJ , where ξ is given as in Eq. 4. First, for J = 1 ˆ
                                                                                                          ⊗JM
we calculate
                                    J ξ = −eR ⊗ ˆ JM ψR + eL ⊗ ˆ JM ψL .
For the fluctuated Dirac operator DA of Eq. 3 we find
                ˆ it Dψ
     DA ξ = −eR ⊗             ˆ it Dψ
                     / R + eL ⊗    / L − meL ⊗ ˆ ψR + meR ⊗            ˆ it γ µ ψR + Aµ eL ⊗
                                                          ˆ ψL − Aµ eR ⊗                   ˆ it γ µ ψL
                                                                                 
          = −eR ⊗     / R − mψL + it γ µ Aµ ψR + eL ⊗

                                                    ˆ it Dψ

                                     / A ξ, and using the orthogonality of L2 (S)0 and L2 (S)1 , we obtain
Taking the inner product of J ξ with D

                                                     / − mψ + it γ µ Aµ ψ
                             hJ ξ | DA ξiJ = JM ψ it Dψ                     .
                                                                          J         M


Remark 5.3. Let us consider the above result for the usual case of a 4-dimensional time- and space-
oriented Lorentzian manifold M of signature (1, 3). A choice of decomposition T M = Et ⊕ Es determines
a unit timelike vector field e0 ∈ Γ(Et ), because Et is oriented and has rank 1. The fundamental symmetry
then equalsRJM = γ(e0 ), and (using standard physics notation) we will write the (indefinite) inner product
                                       †
as hψ|φi = M ψφ R dvolg , where ψ = ψ γ(e0 ) is the Dirac adjoint of ψ. We can then rewrite the Krein action
as SED [ψ, A] = M LED [ψ, A] dvolg , where the Lagrangian is given by
                                                                       
                                   LED [ψ, A] := ψ iγ µ (∇µ + Aµ ) − m ψ.

This is indeed precisely the usual (fermionic part of the) Lagrangian for electrodynamics (compare, for
instance, [PS95, §4.1]).


6    The electro-weak theory
In this section we will describe the electro-weak interactions between leptons (i.e., neutrinos and electrons).
The description given here is largely an adaptation of [DS12, §5].
    Consider the finite-dimensional Hilbert space HF := HR ⊕HL , where HR = HL = C2 . This Hilbert space
is Z2 -graded with even part HF0 = HL and odd part HF1 = HR . We denote the basis of HF by {νR , eR , νL , eL },
where the elements νR , νL describe the (right- and left-handed) neutrinos, and eR , eL describe the electrons.
    We consider the (real) algebra AF = C ⊕ H, along with two even (real-linear) representations π : AF →
B(HR ) ⊕ B(HL ) and π op : AopF → B(HR ) ⊕ B(HL ) given by
                                                   
                                       λ0        α β                                
                π(λ, q) := qλ ⊕ q :=         ⊕          ,              π op (λ, q)op := λ ⊕ λ,
                                       0λ       −β α

for λ ∈ C and q = α + βj ∈ H. The representation π̃ := π ⊗ π op of AF ⊙ Aop
                                                                         F on HR ⊕ HL is then given by

                                      π̃((λ, q) ⊗ (λ′ , q ′ )op ) = λ′ qλ ⊕ λ′ q.

We define the mass matrix on the basis {νR , eR , νL , eL } as
                                                                   

                                  DF :=   imν 0
                                                                    .
                                                             0   0 
                                               0 ime 0           0

We then consider the even finite space FEW := (AF , HF , DF , JF = 1).
Proposition 6.1. The gauge group of FEW equals
                                                               
                                       G(FEW ) = U (1) × SU (2) /Z2 .


                                                          10
Proof. We have U(AF ) = U (1) × SU (2). The kernel of ρ = π̃ ◦ ∆ : U(AF ) → B(HF ) equals Ker ρ =
{(±1, ±1) ∈ U(AF )} ≃ Z2 . The quotient G(FED ) = U(AF )/ Ker ρ is thus given by U (1) × SU (2) /Z2 .
    Let (M, g) again be an even-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spin manifold as in Proposition 4.1, for
which t is odd. The representations π and π op obviously extend to representations of Cc∞ (M, AF ) and
Cc∞ (M, AF )op on HF ˆ
                     ⊗ L2 (S), and it is easy to see that these representations satisfy the order-one condition

Proof. Write A = j aj ⊗ bop    j =

is satisfied, the fluctuation is of the form ηD (A) = aj [D, bj ] + a∗op         ∗op                ˆ t/         ˆ

The below calculations are similar to those in [DS12, §5.2.2], and therefore we shall be brief. From the

A ensures Krein-self-adjointness of φ, and therefore self-adjointness of iφ (since φ anti-commutes with J ).
Hence we must have φ′1 = φ1 and φ′2 = φ2 . Furthermore, we can write

The desired expression for SEW [Ψ, A] = hξ | DA ξi = hJ ξ | DA ξiJ then follows by using the orthogonality of
L2 (S)0 and L2 (S)1 and the symmetry of h·|·i.

for the lepton sector of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam theory of electroweak interactions, including right-
handed neutrinos (but without Majorana masses). For instance, the term hΨL |Φ∗ ΨR i can be rewritten in

which are indeed the standard mass terms for the neutrino and the electron.

6.1    Majorana masses
Let us briefly discuss how one can add Majorana masses into the model as well. For this purpose, we double
up the Hilbert space, and introduce a real structure (for the definition of a real structure, see e.g. [Con95,
Definition 3] or [CM07, Definition 1.124]). Given the Hilbert space HF with basis {νR , eR , νL , eL }, we create
an identical copy HF on which we denote the basis as {νR , eR , νL , eL }, and we interpret this new copy as
describing the anti-particles. We then consider the new Hilbert space ĤF := HF ⊕ HF along with a mass
matrix D̂F , a ‘fundamental symmetry’ JˆF , a grading Γ̂F , and the real structure JˆF given by
                       ∗
                                                                                                  
                 DF −DM             ˆ       1 0                   ΓF 0                ˆ        0 c. c.
      D̂F :=                ,      JF :=          ,      Γ̂F :=               ,      JF :=                ,
                DM DF                       0 −1                   0 −ΓF                     c. c. 0

where c. c. denotes complex conjugation (with respect to the standard basis), and DF is the complex conjugate
of the mass matrix DF . The map DM : HF → HF is given as DM νR := imR νR , where mR ∈ R is the
Majorana mass of the right-handed neutrino, and DM eR = DM νL = DM eL = 0. We point out that D̂F
is Krein-self-adjoint, and that JˆF anti-commutes with both JˆF and Γ̂F . The mass matrix D̂F does not
commute (or anti-commute) with the real structure JˆF ; instead we have the relation D̂F JˆF = JˆF D̂F∗ (where
we used the symmetry of DM ). Thus the commutator picks out the skew-adjoint part of D̂F , which is just
the part containing the Majorana mass. To be precise:
                                                                
                                                      −2DM 0
                                      [D̂F , JˆF ] =               ◦ c. c.
                                                        0  2DM

     Recalling the representations π : AF → B(HF ) and π op : Aop
                                                               F → B(HF ), we obtain representations
π̂ : AF → B(HF ⊕ HF ) and π̂ op : Aop
                                    F → B(HF ⊕ HF ) given by

                     π̂(a) := π(a) ⊕ π op (at ),                    π̂ op (a) := JˆF π̂(a∗ )JˆF ,

where at denotes the matrix transpose of a. With these definitions, we obtain a new finite space F̂EW :=
(AF ⊙ Aop                 ˆ                                                       ˆ
         F , ĤF , D̂F , JF ) with grading operator Γ̂F and with a real structure JF .
   Now consider a 4-dimensional Lorentzian spin manifold M . We also equip the Krein spectral triple
over M (given in Proposition 4.1) with a real structure, given by the charge conjugation operator JM on
the spinor bundle. For even-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, the (anti)commutation relations of
the charge conjugation operator are given in [Bau94, Proposition 3]. In the 4-dimensional Lorentzian case,
the charge conjugation operator commutes with the Clifford representation and with the Dirac operator /   D,
                                                                2
anti-commutes with the grading operator ΓM , and satisfies JM     = −1 . Since JM commutes with the Clifford
representation, it commutes with the fundamental symmetry JM = γ(e0 ).
   Next, we can consider the almost-commutative manifold F̂EW ×M , which we equip with the real structure
J := JˆF ⊗
         ˆ JM . We calculate

  J 2 = (JˆF ⊗
             ˆ JM )(JˆF ⊗
                        ˆ JM ) = −JˆF2 ⊗   2

                                                               ˆ (−ΓM JM ) = (Γ̂F ⊗          ⊗ JM ) = ΓJ,
  JJ = (JˆF ˆ                           ˆ JM JM = (−JˆF JˆF ) ˆ
                       ˆ JM ) = JˆF JˆF ⊗
            ⊗ JM )(JˆF ⊗                                      ⊗ (JM JM ) = (JˆF ⊗

                                                       13
We note that to get [J, J ] = 0 (which we need below) we used that JˆF JˆF = −JˆF JˆF , and hence it is essential
that JF is non-trivial.
    Since we have doubled the finite-dimensional Hilbert space, we have introduced too many degrees of
freedom. To correct this, we follow the approach of [Bar07] and consider vectors η ∈ H0 which (in addition
to Γη = η) also satisfy Jη = η. Since J 2 = 1 and JΓ = ΓJ, this assumption makes sense, and it means we
can write η = ξ + Jξ, where ξ is an element of (HF ˆ⊗ L2 (S))0 as given in Eq. 5. The fermionic action is then
of the form

              hJ η | DA ηiJ = hJ ξ | DA ξiJ + hJ Jξ | DA ξiJ + hJ ξ | DA JξiJ + hJ Jξ | DA JξiJ .

The last term can be rewritten as

                           hJ Jξ | DA JξiJ = hJ Jξ | JDA ξiJ + hJJ ξ | [DA , J]ξiJ ,

The commutator [DA , J] equals i[D̂F , JˆF ] ˆ
                                            ⊗ JM . For ξ ∈ (HF ˆ                                   ˆ L2 (S) while
                                                                 ⊗ L2 (S))0 we have [DA , J]ξ ∈ HF ⊗
JJ ξ ∈ HF ˆ ⊗L2 (S). The subspaces HF ˆ  ⊗L2 (S) and HF ˆ ⊗L2 (S) are orthogonal, so the term hJJ ξ | [DA , J]ξiJ
vanishes. Since J commutes with J , we find that hJ Jξ | DA JξiJ = hJ ξ | DA ξiJ = SEW [Ψ, A].
    Hence the only new contributions to the fermionic action come from the terms hJ Jξ | DA ξiJ and
hJ ξ | DA JξiJ . Since the subspaces HF ˆ    ⊗ L2 (S) and HF ⊗  ˆ L2 (S) are orthogonal, we only need to con-
sider the part of DA which mixes particles and anti-particles, which is precisely just the Majorana mass
matrix DM . For the vector ξRν
                               := νR ⊗ ˆ ψR ν
                                               representing the right-handed neutrino, we calculate

Summarising, we can extend the electro-weak theory to include Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos,
and we obtain the new action SEW+M given by
                                                         ν      ν             ν   ν
                       SEW+M [Ψ, A] = 2SEW [Ψ, A] − mR hψR |JM ψR i − mR hJM ψR |ψR i,

where SEW is given in Proposition 6.3.
Remark 6.4. In this section we have introduced the notion of real structure on a Krein spectral triple
in a rather ad hoc manner. One might wonder how to describe the general theory of real Krein spectral
triples. Do we for instance obtain an alternative notion for the KO-dimension of such triples? While the
KO-dimension of real spectral triples arises from the eightfold Bott periodicity in real K-homology, there is
no Krein version of K-homology, and hence the answer to this question is not straightforward. In any case,
one would expect that the signs determining the (anti)commutation relations of the real structure now not
only depend on the dimension, but also on the signature. For the even-dimensional case, these signs are
given in [Bau94].


7    The Standard Model
Given the description of the electro-weak theory of the previous section, it is fairly straightforward to extend
this theory to the full Standard Model as described in [Con06, CCM07]. This extension is basically obtained

                                                       14
by including a summand M3 (C) in the algebra AF to describe the strong interactions, and by enlarging
the Hilbert space HF to incorporate the quarks. Moreover, the Hilbert space is then enlarged three-fold to
include three generations of all elementary particles. Since most of the details are similar to the electro-weak
theory, and since there is already plenty of literature available on the noncommutative description of the
Standard Model (see e.g. [Con96, Con06, CCM07, CM07, JKSS07, CC10, DS12]), we shall be rather brief
in this section.
    Thus, we take the algebra AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3 (C), which is represented on the finite-dimensional Hilbert
space HF := (HR ⊕HL )⊗C3 . The factor C3 describes the fact that there are three generations of elementary
particles. The right-handed particles HR and the left-handed particles HL are both given by C2 ⊕ (C2 ⊗ C3 ).
Here the first summand C2 describes the two leptons ν and e, and the second summand C2 ⊗ C3 describes
the quarks uc and dc (which occur in three colours c = r, g, b).
    We will consider the commuting representations π : AF → B((HR ⊕ HL ) ⊗ C3 ) and π op : Aop    F → B((HR ⊕
HL ) ⊗ C3 ) given by
                                                                                
                                π(λ, q, b) := (qλ ⊕ (qλ ⊗ 1)) ⊕ (q ⊕ (q ⊗ 1)) ⊗ 1,
                                                                                
                             π op (λ, q, b) := (λ ⊕ (1 ⊗ bt )) ⊕ (λ ⊕ (1 ⊗ bt )) ⊗ 1,

where bt denotes the matrix transpose of b. The representation π̃ := π ⊗ π op : AF ⊙ Aop            F → B(HF ) is then
given by                                                                                        
                  π̃ (λ, q, b) ⊗ (λ′ , q ′ , b′ )op = (λ′ qλ ⊕ (qλ ⊗ b′t )) ⊕ (λ′ q ⊕ (q ⊗ b′t )) ⊗ 1.
We consider the even finite space FSM := (AF , HF , DF , JF = 1), where the mass matrix is given by
                                                                          
                                 0 0 −iYν 0                 0 0 −iYu 0
                               0 0      0 −iYe         
                                                    ⊕ 0 0         0 −iYd   ⊗ 1.
                       DF :=  iYν 0    0     0         iYu 0    0     0 
                                 0 iYe 0       0            0 iYd 0       0

Here each Y• is a hermitian 3 × 3-matrix corresponding to the three generations of each type of particle.
    Similarly to
               Proposition 6.1, the gauge group of the finite space FSM is given by G(FSM ) = U (1) ×
SU (2) × U (3) /Z2 . This gauge group does not match the gauge group of the Standard Model (even modulo
finite groups), since we have a factor U (3) instead of SU (3). As in [CCM07, §2.5] (see also [DS12, §6.2.1]),
we will therefore impose the unimodularity condition det |HF ρ(u) = 1, which yields the subgroup
                                n                                               12      o
                    SG(FSM ) = ρ(u) ∈ G(FSM ) : u = (λ, q, b) ∈ U(AF ), λ det b      =1 .

The effect of the unimodularity condition is that the determinant of b ∈ U (3) is identified (modulo the
finite group µ12 of 12th-roots of unity) to λ ∈ U (1). In other words, imposing the unimodularity condition
provides us, modulo some finite abelian group, with the gauge group U (1) × SU (2) × SU (3) of the Standard
Model.
    The calculations for the inner fluctuations and the fermionic action of the Standard Model are similar to
the case of the electro-weak theory (although somewhat more cumbersome). Below we will simply give the
results.
Proposition 7.1. The fluctuation of D by A ∈ Pert(Cc∞ (M, AF )) is of the form

    Similarly to Eq. 5, an arbitrary vector ξ ∈ H0 = HL ⊗ L2 (S)0 ⊕ HR ⊗ L2 (S)1 is uniquely determined
by Dirac spinors ψ ν (describing the three neutrinos), ψ e (describing the electron, muon, and tau-particle),
ψ u (describing the up, charm, and top quarks in three colours) and ψ d (describing the down, strange,
and bottom quarks in three colours), where we have omitted the generational index from our notation.
We group these spinors together into the multiplets Ψl ∈ L2 (S) ⊗ C2 ⊗ C3 (describing the leptons) and
Ψq ∈ L2 (S) ⊗ C2 ⊗ C3 ⊗ C3 (describing the quarks).

    We observe that the Lagrangian calculated above is precisely (the fermionic part of) the usual Lagrangian
for the Standard Model, including right-handed neutrinos (but without Majorana masses). For the possible
inclusion of Majorana masses for the right-handed neutrinos, the procedure is the same as in Section 6.1,
and we shall not repeat it here.
