Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and
multi-functionality suggests ‘flat’ platforms - ultrathin
layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs.
With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous
four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest.
In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility χ(2) , SFWM can generate photon pairs both
directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility
χ(3) , and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic
generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that
in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the
wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than
for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement
the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order
nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN).
The existence of both second- and third-order nonlinear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum
state engineering.

1. INTRODUCTION
Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) - a secondorder nonlinear process where a single pump photon splits into a
pair of daughter photons - is widely used to generate entangled
photons in bulk crystals and waveguides. During the last few
years, SPDC has been also implemented in micro- and nanoscale
nonlinear layers [1–12]. Due to their tiny thickness, such layers
satisfy the SPDC phase-matching automatically, even though
the wavevector mismatch ∆k can be very large. As a result,
materials with high second-order susceptibility χ(2) , or orienta-

tions using large components of the χ̂(2) tensor, which normally
are excluded from SPDC because of phase-matching restriction,
come into play. Although, because of the small thickness, such
sources produce photon pairs at low rates – up to a few kHz so
far [12, 13] – their advantage is multifunctionality. For example,
a thin layer can generate photon pairs not only forwards, but
also backwards and bidirectionally [14]; by tuning the pump
polarization, the polarization state and the degree of entanglement of the photon pairs can be also tuned [3, 6]; the pump
wavelength and direction can be chosen arbitrarily.
The variety of materials used to generate entangled photons
through SPDC is quickly expanding. Most promising are vander-Waals crystals [4, 6, 8, 10], whose nonlinearity can be controlled by stacking several atomic layers in different ways [15].
Recently, entangled photons were generated in a liquid crystal [13, 16], which offers new ways to control the properties of
entangled photons: through molecular orientation twist and by
applying electric field.
An alternative way to generate photon pairs is the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), where two pump photons
are converted into a pair of entangled photons and the thirdorder susceptibility χ(3) is involved. Since χ(3) is nonzero in any
material, the material choice becomes broader. An important
advantage of SFWM is that it generates entangled photons on
both sides of the pump spectral line. This allows one of the photons to cover blue or even UV range of wavelengths [17] without
using even more blue-shifted pump. During the last few years,
considerable efforts to implement SFWM in ‘flat’ sources have
been made. However, due to the weakness of the third-order
nonlinear interaction compared to the second-order one, most of
the experiments on SFWM in thin sources are carried out in the
seeded regime [18–22], where a coherent beam at the frequency
of one of the output photons is stimulating the process. So far,
there are only two experiments on photon pair generation via
SFWM in thin layers [23, 24].
Meanwhile, SFWM can also take place in noncentrosymmetric materials, where both χ(2) and χ(3) are
present. Such materials were so far avoided in SFWM experiments. In the absence of the phase-matching restriction, a direct
third-order nonlinear process should compete with a cascaded
process. For example, the third harmonic can be generated not
only directly but also through the second harmonic generation
(SHG) followed by sum frequency generation. This cascaded

Letter

process is well-studied, both theoretically and experimentally [25, 26]. Similarly, both cascaded and direct nonlinear
processes can generate photon pairs at a certain wavelength
set ωs (signal) and ωi (idler). In the cascaded process, first,
the pump at ω p is up-converted to the second harmonic
(ω p + ω p → ωSH ), and then the second harmonic (SH) photons
are down-converted through SPDC: ωSH → ωs + ωi . The direct
process generates photon pairs through SFWM: 2ω p → ωs + ωi .
The cascaded process is commonly considered to be stronger
compared to the direct one. However, its phase-matching
condition is more restrictive than that of the direct process.
In this work, we show that in a thin nonlinear layer, the direct
process is always stronger. To demonstrate this effect experimentally, we use a 10 µm-thick lithium niobate (LN) crystal and
generate photon pairs through SFWM.

respectively. The detection events are triggered by the electric
pulses of the laser and registered by the time tagger.

Fig. 1. Experimental setup: lens L1 focuses the pump on

the LN sample; signal (visible, shown in blue) and idler (IR,
shown in orange) photons are collimated by lens L2, separated
by dichroic mirror DM, and coupled into detectors D1, D2 by
lenses L3, L4, respectively. Their polarization is analyzed by
an HWP and a PBS in each arm. Filter F1 eliminates unwanted
wavelengths in the pump beam, and bandpass filters F2, F3
select the signal and idler photon detection bands. Photon
detection events are registered by a time tagger triggered by
pulses from the laser.
1030 nm, with a pulse duration of 210 fs and a repetition rate
of 1.023 MHz, is used as the pump. Its power and polarization
are controlled by two half-wave plates (HWPs) and a polarizing
beam splitter (PBS). A band-pass filter (F1) at 1030 nm with 10
nm bandwidth filters out unwanted wavelengths. The pump is
focused by lens L1 into a 100 µm spot on the 10 µm-thick x-cut
LN layer on a 500 µm-thick fused silica substrate, and the output
photons are collimated by lens L2 with the focal length 100 mm
and NA=0.5. The collected photons are separated by a long-pass
dichroic mirror (DM) with the cut-off wavelength at 950 nm. The
visible (reflected) and IR (transmitted) photons are coupled to
the multi-mode fibers at the end of each arm by lenses L3 and
L4, respectively. At each arm, an HWP and a PBS are installed
to analyze the polarization of the photons. The detection wavelengths are selected by band-pass filters F2 (770 nm with 10 nm
band width) and F3 (1550 nm with 50 nm band width), respectively. The coupled photons are sent to single-photon detectors
D1 (Perkin&Elmer, SPCM-AQRH-16-FC) and D2 (IDQ, ID220),

exhibit different dependences on the pump power, one quadratic
and the other linear. The quadratic power dependence is indeed
expected for SFWM. Meanwhile, the linear power scaling of the
IR photons rate with the pump can be explained by SPDC. Indeed, under pumping at 1030 nm, SPDC in thin LN can generate
signal photons at 1550 nm, with their idler counterparts being at
3.078 µm. The coherence length for this process is 15 µm, longer
than the sample thickness. While the idler photons cannot be
detected by our setup, the signal photons generation rate should
be much higher than the SFWM rate. Consequently, the dominant contribution to the rate of IR photons is from SPDC, which
scales linearly with the pump power. Importantly, SPDC cannot
affect the coincidence detection in our experiment because the
idler SPDC photons are not detected in the visible arm.
Since the strongest components of LN second- and third(2)

(3)

order nonlinear susceptibility tensors are χzzz and χzzzz , respectively, both SPDC and SFWM are most efficient if the pump and
the output photons are all polarized along the z axis. Indeed, the
photon count rates are maximal for the pump polarized along
the z axis (see Supplement 1). Also, from Fig. 2(b), where the polarization dependences of ⟨ Nvis ⟩ and ⟨ NIR ⟩ are plotted, we see
that both visible and IR photons are polarized the same way as
the pump. For visible photons, this is evidence that they mostly
come from SFWM and not from two-photon photoluminescence.
Figure 2(c) shows the mean number of coincidences per pulse
⟨ Ncc ⟩ as a function of the pump power. The dependence is
quadratic, as expected for SFWM. The efficiency of pair generation is much lower than the one measured in SiN films using

the same pump [24]; however, higher rates can be achieved
because of the high damage threshold of LN at 1030 nm. The
second-order correlation function g(2) , calculated as
g (2) (0 ) =

⟨ Ncc ⟩
,
⟨ Nvis ⟩⟨ NIR ⟩

(1)

is plotted in panel (d). The fitting curve is g(2) = 1 + a/P2 ,
where a is a fitting parameter and P is the pump power. The g(2)
exceeding the ‘thermal’ value 2 and its inverse dependence on
the mean photon number of SFWM (scaling as P2 ) indicate the
detection of correlated photon pairs.
Importantly, the fused silica substrate could also contribute
to SFWM, due to its noticeable χ(3) = 3 × 10−22 m2 /V2 [27] and
large length. Its contribution can be estimated from these parameters and the phase matching condition (see the Supplementary
Information) as 25% of the total rate of coincidences.
So far, it was not clear if the observed photon pairs are generated through the direct or cascaded process. To figure out
the contribution of the cascaded process, we first investigated
the efficiency of its second stage. To this end, using the same
setup, we detected photon pairs from SPDC pumped at 515 nm.
The pump was prepared by frequency-doubling the 1030 nm
radiation in a bulk phase-matched BBO crystal installed after F1
(see Fig. 1). Further, knowing the efficiency of SHG from the LN
layer, we estimated ⟨ Ncc ⟩ stemming from the cascaded process.

SFWM generating 770 nm / 1550 nm photon pairs from 1030 nm
pump (green solid line), SHG from 1030 nm (blue dot-dashed
line), and SPDC generating 770 nm / 1550 nm photon pairs
from 515 nm pump (red dashed line). For each process, the
phase matching function oscillates (Maker fringes), reaching
maxima at odd numbers of the nonlinear coherence length
Lcoh = π/|∆k|. The nonlinear coherence lengths for the three
processes are 33.3 µm, 3.1 µm, and 3.4 µm, respectively; therefore, the efficiencies of both steps of the cascaded process should
oscillate faster than the efficiency of direct SFWM. Moreover,
because the peak values of F2 ( L) scale inversely with ∆k2 , they
are much lower for SHG and SPDC than for SFWM. This already
gives a qualitative explanation for the effect we see: because
|∆k SFW M | = |∆k SHG | − |∆k SPDC | ≪ |∆k SHG |, |∆k SPDC |, the
phase-matching function of SFWM considerably exceeds the
ones of SHG and SPDC.

Figure 3 shows the correlation measurement results for SPDC
in the same LN layer, pumped at 515 nm. The mean number of
coincidences per pulse ⟨ Ncc ⟩ is plotted as a function of pump
power with a linear fitting curve in panel (a). Panel (b) shows
the correlation function g(2) , calculated according to Eq. 1, with
the fitting curve g(2) = 1 + a/P. Meanwhile, the SHG efficiency
of the LN layer is evaluated by measuring the pump and SH
powers after the sample. The measured conversion efficiency is
2 × 10−2 %/W: pumping with 400 mW at 1030 nm yields 30 µW
of SH. Based on this measurement, under 400 mW pumping the
cascaded process generates 4 × 10−8 pairs per pulse, which is
only 5% of the total rate of photon pairs.

For an accurate comparison, we consider both second-order
processes, SHG and SPDC, occurring simultaneously. Assuming
a non-depleted pump, the electric field amplitude of the SH
generated from the pump propagating along the x-direction is

Omitting the common factors in Eqs. (5,7), we see that the rates
of pair generation through the cascaded and direct processes are,
9
respectively, Rcas ∝ 49 | Acas |2 and Rdir ∝ 16
| Adir |2 .
Figure 4 (b) shows these rates as functions of the crystal
length: in green solid line for the direct process and in blue
dot-dashed line for the cascaded process. For the calculation, we
(3)
used the values of χ(2) = 2.5 × 10−11 m/V [31] and χSFW M =
1.5 × 10−20 m2 /V2 [32]. The rates oscillate with the same period,

equal to twice the coherence length of the SFWM process. This is
because the first term in the square brackets of Eq. (6) dominates,
see Fig. 4(b). At 10 µm thickness, the ratio Rcas /Rdir is 0.048,
which is in good correspondence to the experimental result.
If the cascaded process has the phase matching satisfied for
both its stages (i.e., through periodic poling), it should be more
efficient than direct SFWM. Note that for ∆k SH = ∆k SPDC = 0,
the field in Eq. (3) scales as z, which leads to Eq. (6) scaling as
L2 instead of L. But here we see that without phase matching
satisfied, SHG and SPDC have larger wavevector mismatches
than SPDC, which makes the cascaded process less efficient than
the direct one.
SFWM in thin second-order nonlinear films can considerably
enrich the toolbox of ’flat’ quantum optics. In high-χ(2) semiconductors, such as GaAs or AlGaAs, it can produce photon pairs
with one of the photons above the bandgap, which is impossible
through SPDC. Moreover, as we show above, a second-order
nonlinear film pumped at frequency ω p can simultaneously generate photon pairs at frequencies ωs and ωi through SFWM, but
also at frequencies ωi and ω p − ωi through SPDC. This simultaneous action of two coherently pumped nonlinear effects can be
used for building interesting quantum superpositions.
