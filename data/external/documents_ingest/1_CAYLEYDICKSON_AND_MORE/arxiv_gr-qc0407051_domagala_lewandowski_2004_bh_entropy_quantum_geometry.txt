Abstract
Quantum Geometry (the modern Loop Quantum Gravity using graphs and
spin-networks instead of the loops) provides microscopic degrees of freedom
that account for the black-hole entropy. However, the procedure for state
counting used in the literature contains an error and the number of the relevant horizon states is underestimated. In our paper a correct method of
counting is presented. Our results lead to a revision of the literature of the
subject. It turns out that the contribution of spins greater then 1/2 to the
entropy is not negligible. Hence, the value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
involved in the spectra of all the geometric and physical operators in this
theory is different than previously derived. Also, the conjectured relation between Quantum Geometry and the black hole quasi-normal modes should be
understood again.

I. INTRODUCTION AND RESULTS

Quantum Geometry [1–3] provides microscopic degrees of freedom that account for the
black-hole entropy. The issue was raised in works by Krasnov [4] and Rovelli [5]. The final quantum Isolated Horizon framework was introduced by Ashtekar, Baez, Corichi and
Krasnov [8]. The framework describes a black-hole in equilibrium surrounded by a quite
arbitrary space-time. In the canonical formulation of the theory, the classical phase space
is restricted to the set of space-times containing a black-hole of a fixed area a. After quantization, the kinematic Hilbert space is the tensor product of the horizon Hilbert space HS
and the bulk Hilbert space HΣ . Elements of HS are identified with the black-hole kinematic
quantum states. They represent quantum excitations of the U(1) spin connection defined on
the horizon. Mathematically, they are described by the quantum Chern-Simons theories on
a punctured sphere, where all possible sets of punctures are admitted. Therefore, they are
labeled by certain sequences of numbers (referred to as spins) assigned to the punctures. The
bulk states, that is elements of HΣ , on the other hand, are described by Quantum Geometry,
and define the quantum area of the horizon [6,7]. The quantum constraints commute with
the quantum horizon area operator. Most importantly, all the solutions whose quantum
areas fall into any given finite interval [a − δa, a + δa] can be labeled by a finite number of
the black-hole states (and by other labels corresponding to the bulk states). That number
defines the Ashtekar-Baez-Corichi-Krasnov black-hole entropy. However, the procedure introduced in [8] for state counting contains a spurious constraint on admissible sequences of
the labels, and the number of the relevant horizon states is underestimated. The goal of our
work1 is to point out this error, to formulate a correct counting procedure, and to study the
consequences. Several conclusions of [8] have to be re-examined:
(i) the statement that the leading contribution to the entropy comes entirely from the
simplest states (characterized by punctures with labels ±1/2),
(ii) the confirmation of the Bekenstein and Hawking formula [9],
(iii) the determination of the value of the free parameter γ introduced in Quantum Geometry by Barbero and Immirzi, as
ln 2
γABCK = √ .

The Barbero-Immirzi parameter labeles different sectors of Quantum Geometry. The spectra
of all the geometric and physical operators depend on γ. For example the quantized area is
proportional to γ.
Therefore, in our paper we go back to the issue of calculating the entropy within the
Quantum Geometry and the Ashtekar-Baez-Corichi-Krasnov framework. We formulate an
exact combinatoric problem whose solution is the entropy: we carefully define a set of
sequences freely labeling the black-hole quantum states which correspond to eigenvalues of

the quantum area operator equal or less than a. The entropy is ln N(a), where N(a) is the
number of elements of this set. Next, we address the issue of the proportionality of the
entropy to the area. We consider the ratio
ln N(a)
a

which is expected to be constant in the limit as a → ∞. We find that for large a,

a ≤ ln N(a) ≤
a.

As before (in [8]), the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ can be fixed by assuming the agreement
with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy (the proportionality of the entropy to the area in the
leading order is not proved yet, at this point, but see below). Then, (3) provides lower and
upper bounds for γ,

These results lead to a revision of the literature of the subject.
To begin with, they show that the number of states characterized by the lowest spin
labels is essentially smaller than the number of all the states contributing to a given value of
the horizon area. Therefore, the horizon states labeled by higher spins do contribute to the
leading term of the entropy. In the consequence, the ABCK model of quantum black hole
does not agree with Wheeler’s heuristic model ‘It from bit’. The (contradicted here) conclusion (i) listed above, had been used in [10] to point out a remarkable relation between the
black hole quasi-normal modes, the Bekenshtein-Hawking entropy and the ABCK entropy
provided the minimal spin of the quantum excitations of the horizon is 1 rather then 1/2. In
view of our correction, the meaning of that observation of [10] should be understood again.
Next, the conclusion (iii) listed above is not true: the value of the parameter γ can not
be that of (1).
We were not able to verify the proportionality of the horizon entropy to the area ourselves.
However, our combinatoric formulation of the problem of calculating the entropy derived
in this paper has been later solved in an exact way in the accompanying paper [11]. The
number ln N(a) has been calculated rigorously therein, and the result is
ln N(a) =

γM a
1
− ln a + O(1)
2
γ 4ℓPl 2

(5)

in the limit of large horizon area a, where the value of the parameter γM can be calculated at
arbitrary accuracy. In conclusion, taking into account the results of [11], the proportionality
of the entropy to the area in the leading order for large a is confirmed, and even the subleading terms are calculated.
In the last section we derive the probability distribution of the spin at a given puncture.
The physical meaning of these new results will be discussed in a joint paper [12].

II. THE HORIZON QUANTUM STATES

Our departure point is the quantum Isolated Horizon theory introduced in [8]. A classical
(weakly) isolated horizon is a null, non-expanding world-surface of a space-like 2-sphere S,
equipped with a null vector field of a constant self-acceleration. This idea gave rise to a
new quasi-local theory of black-hole in equilibrium interesting also from purely classical
point of view [13]. The local degrees of freedom of space-time geometry out of the horizon
are not restricted. An additional assumption satisfied by the isolated horizon geometry
considered in [8] is the spherical symmetry (see [3] for a discussion of the general case). The
classical phase space introduced in the Ashtekar-Baez-Corichi-Krasnov framework consists
of all the gravitational fields which can exist in a neighborhood of an isolated horizon.
The location and area a of the horizon are fixed. In the corresponding 3 + 1 Hamiltonian
framework the horizon is represented by a 2-sphere S, whereas the remaining part of space
under consideration (bulk) is the exterior region, a 3-manifold Σ bounded by S. The only
kinematic degrees of freedom of the horizon S are given by a U(1) connection defined on a
spin bundle over S. The gravitational field data is defined on Σ. The bulk and the horizon
data are subject to a consistency condition ensuring that the world-surface of S is indeed
an isolated horizon. In the quantum theory of this system, the bulk gravitational field is
described by Quantum Geometry. The quantum consistency condition between the bulk and
the horizon implies that the quantum degrees of freedom of the horizon should be described
by a union of the Chern-Simons theories on arbitrarily punctured S.
Below, we outline the elements of the quantum theory which play a role in the entropy
calculation. The kinematic Hilbert space of the quantum Isolated Horizon theory is contained
in the tensor product HS ⊗HΣ , where HS is the Hilbert space of the quantum horizon degrees
of freedom whereas HΣ is the Hilbert space of the quantum geometry defined in the bulk Σ.
To characterize the bulk quantum geometry Hilbert space HΣ , it is convenient to use
a certain orthogonal decomposition adapted to the boundary S. Consider a finite set of
points,
P = {p1 , ..., pn } ⊂ S,

(6)

and a labeling of elements of P by numbers j = (j1 , ..., jn ), and m = m1 , ..., mn ) where
1
ji ∈ N,
2

mi ∈ {−j1 , ..., ji }

(7)

for i = 1, ..., n. The ji labels are assumed not to vanish,
ji 6= 0 .

(8)

(9)

The space HΣ is the orthogonal sum
HΣ =

(P,j,m)

P,j,m

,

where P runs through all the finite subsets of S, (j, m) through all the finite labeling (7,8),
∅
and the empty set P = ∅ is also associated a (non-trivial) single Hilbert space HΣ
. Each
4

P,j,m
of the subspaces HΣ
is a certain (infinitely dimensional) Hilbert space. To understand
the (quantum) geometric meaning of these subspaces, consider any piece S ′ of the horizon
S (more precisely, S ′ is an arbitrary 2-sub-manifold in the 2-sphere S). The quantum area
operator ÂS ′ is defined in HΣ . Another operator of the quantum geometry in Σ assigned to
P,j,m
S ′ is the flux ÊS ′ of the vector field normal to S.2 Every subspace HΣ
is the eigenspace
of the operators. The corresponding eigenvalues are:

where only those points pi ∈ P contribute which are contained also in S ′ , and γ > 0 is a
free parameter of Quantum Geometry known as Barbero-Immirzi parameter. In particular,
if we take for S ′ the whole horizon S, then the corresponding eigenvalue of the horizon area
operator is (we drop P because only the set of the values of j matters)
Xp
ji (ji + 1).
(12)
ajS = 8πγℓ2Pl
i

Of course the quantum area and flux operators are defined also for 2-dimensional submanifolds of Σ which do not intersect S, and there are also other interesting operators of
Quantum Geometry acting in HΣ but they are not used in the Isolated Horizon framework.
We turn now to the horizon Hilbert space HS . Recall, that the ABCK framework requires
fixing an arbitrary value for the classical horizon area a. In order to quantize consistently
the horizon degrees of freedom, it is assumed in [8] that the fixed classical area a is quantized
in the following way,
a = 4πγℓ2Pl k,

k ∈ N,

(13)

where k is arbitrary. The horizon Hilbert space can also be orthogonally decomposed in a
~ of
way analogous to (9). In this case the labeling set consists of all the finite sequences P
points in S, labeled by arbitrary non-zero integers defined modulo k, and whose sum is zero
modulo k,

2 There are two subtleties, which may be intriguing for the reader. The first one is that classically

the flux of a vector field normal to a surface is the same as the area of the surface. In our quantum
case however, the vector field is a quantum operator itself, in fact it is one of the SU(2) spin
operators. The area, on the other hand, is given by the total SU(2) spin operator. The second
subtlety is, that S ′ contained in the horizon is assigned the area and flux by the bulk geometry.

To every labeled sequence (P,

of the holonomy transport along a circle containing pi . The full horizon Hilbert space can

It involves the holonomy operators acting in HSP,b on the one hand and the flux operators

acting in HΣ
on the other hand (see [8] or [3] for a summary). The set of solutions is the

such that the points coincide modulo the ordering
~ = (p1 , ..., pn ),

P = {p1 , ..., pn }

(18)

and the labelings agree with each other in the following way
bi = −2mi mod k.

(19)

In conclusion, the kinematic Hilbert space of states in the ABCK quantum Isolated Horizon
framework is the orthogonal sum with respect to all the labeled sequences of points in S
which satisfy (18,19),
Hkin =

(20)

where we emphasized the dependence of each sequence b = (b1 , ..., bn ) on a sequence m =
(m1 , ..., mn ) via (19).
The final step of the ABCK framework is to take into account the quantum Einstein
constraints [1–3] adjusted to the Isolated Horizon framework [8]. The vector constraints
generate diffeomorphisms of Σ which preserve the boundary S. The diffeomorphisms act
naturally in Hkin and this action is unitary. In the Quantum Geometry framework, the
quantum vector constraints come down to the diffeomorphism invariance. Whereas there
is only one normalizable diffeomorphism invariant state in Hkin , the invariance condition is
imposed in a certain larger space (dual to an appropriate subspace of Hkin ). A Hilbert space
of solutions is constructed via the diffeomorphism averaging procedure whose Quantum
Geometry version is well described in [1,3]. It is particularly easy to explain the result of the
6

analogous diffeomorphism averaging suitable for the space HS itself. Assign to every finite
sequence b = (b1 , ..., bn ) defined in (15) a 1-dimensional Hilbert space HSb , and define
M
HS,phys =
HSb .
(21)
b

The averaging applied to the full space Hkin provides a Hilbert space of the following structure
M
H =
H̃b(m),j,m ,
(22)
j,m

where b = (b1 , ..., bn ), j = (j1 , ...jn ) and m = (m1 , ..., mn ) are arbitrary triples of finite
sequences such that (7,15,19) holds. The remaining constraints are the scalar and the Gauss
constraint. The Gauss constraint amounting to the invariance with respect to the local SU(2)
rotations of the spin frames is already satisfied at S due to (19). The scalar constraint, on
the other hand, has been solved at the horizon already on the classical level. Since the
quantum numbers (j, m) used in (23) characterize the quantum geometry of bulk Σ right
at the boundary S, the plausible, but non-trivial assumption made in [8] is that the bulk
scalar constraints with laps functions vanishing on S do not affect (j, m), and that for every
choice of (j, m) there is a solution of the bulk scalar constraints.
We are lead to a conclusion, that the final physical Hilbert Hphys of the quantum states
can be characterized as
M
Hphys =
Hb(m),j,m ,
(23)
j,m

where b = (b1 , ..., bn ), j = (j1 , ...jn ) and m = (m1 , ..., mn ) are arbitrary triples of finite
sequences such that (7,15,19) is satisfied, and none of the spaces Hb(m),j,m is empty. Since
the horizon area operator ÂS commutes with all the constraints in this framework, it passes
to the physical Hilbert space. It also follows from the details of the diffeomorphism averaging
map, that each of the subspaces Hb(m),j,m is an eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue
(12). In this way, the sequences j are responsible for the area assigned to the 2-surface
S of the horizon by the bulk Quantum Geometry, whereas the sequences b represent the
intrinsic quantum degrees of freedom of the horizon. This is the key conclusion of the
ABCK framework.
III. THE COMBINATORIC FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

From now our treatment starts to differ from that of [8]. Our aim is to define the number
of the quantum states of the horizon which contribute to the entropy in a form of a clear
and precise combinatoric formula.
Recall that the classical area a of the horizon is fixed as
a = 4πγℓ2Pl k,

7

k ∈ N.

(24)

Calculation of the horizon entropy consists in counting those quantum horizon states, elements of the Hilbert space HS,phys (21) labeled by the finite sequences defined in (15) (the
number n of the entries can be arbitrary) which correspond to subspaces Hb(m),j,m in (23)
such that the area operator eigenvalue ajS satisfies the following inequality3
ajS

=

8πγℓ2Pl

n
X
p
ji (ji + 1) ≤ a.

(25)

i=1

Combinatorially, the task amounts to counting the finite sequences (b1 , ..., bn ) of elements of
Zk , such that the following two conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied:
n
X

(i)

bi = 0 ,

(26)

i=1

(ii) there exist two sequences: a sequence (j1 , ..., jn ) consisting of non-zero elements of 21 N
which satisfies the inequality (25), and a sequence (m1 , ..., mn ) such that
bi = −2mi mod k ,
and mi ∈ {−ji , −ji + 1, ..., ji } ,

(27)
(28)

for every i = 1, , , n.
This recipe can be simplified. It is easy to eliminate the ji ’s by noting that, given a
sequence (m1 , ..., mn ), there is a sequence (j1 , ..., jn ) such that (28) and (25) if and only if
8πγℓ2Pl

n
X
p
i=1

|mi |(|mi | + 1) ≤ a.

(29)

Next, it follows from (26, 27) that

is the same.

Hence

(34)

Finally, notice that given a sequence (b1 , ..., bn ) of elements of Zk there is exactly one sequence
(m1 , ..., mn ) of elements of 21 Z such that (27) and (34) holds. In this way, we have derived
the following formula for the entropy counting:
The entropy S of a quantum horizon of the classical area a according to Quantum Geometry and the Ashtekar-Baez-Corichi-Krasnov [8] framework is
S = ln N(a),

(35)

where N(a) is 1 plus the number of all the finite sequences (m1 , ...., mn ) of non-zero elements
of 12 Z, such that the following equality and inequality are satisfied:

(36)

where γ is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter of Quantum Geometry.
The extra term 1 above comes from the trivial sequence.
IV. THE ENTROPY CALCULATIONS

To find an upper bound for the number N(a) introduced in the previous section (recall
that a = 4πγℓ2Pl k, and k ∈ N), consider the set Mk+ of all the finite sequences (m1 , ..., mn )
of non-zero elements of 12 Z which satisfy the inequality in (34), but do not necessarily sum
to zero,that is,
n

X
1
k
Mk+ := {(m1 , ..., mn ) n ∈ N, 0 6= m1 , ..., mn ∈ Z,
|mi | ≤ } .
2
2
i=1

(37)

Let Nk+ be the number of elements of Mk+ plus 1 (the empty sequence). Certainly,
N(a) ≤ Nk+

(38)

Next, since k is arbitrarily fixed integer, let it become a variable of the sequence (N0+ , N1+ , ..., Nk+ , ...).
To establish a recurrence relation satisfied by the
+
sequence (N0+ , N1+ , ..., Nk+ , ...), notice that if (m1 , ..., mn ) ∈ Mk−1
, then both
+
1
1
(m1 , ..., mn , 2 ), (m1 , ..., mn , − 2 ) ∈ Mk . In the same way, for arbitrary natural 0 < l ≤ k,
1
+
(m1 , ..., mn ) ∈ Mk−l
⇒ (m1 , ..., mn , ± l) ∈ Mk+ .
2
9

(39)

+
Obviously, if we consider all 0 < l ≤ k, and all the sequences (m1 , ..., mn ) ∈ Mk−l
, then the
+
1
′
resulting (m1 , ..., mn , ± 2 l) form the entire set Mk . Also, for two different l 6= l ,

1
1
(m1 , ..., mn , ± l) 6= (m1 , ..., mn , ± l′ ).
2

(40)

This proves the following recurrence relation,
+
Nk+ = 2Nk−1
+ ... + 2N0+ + 1.

(41)

Nk+ = 3k .

(42)

N(a) ≤ 3k .

(43)

The (unique) solution is

In conclusion,

To find a lower bound for N(a), we use the inequality
p

1
|mi |(|mi | + 1) ≤ |mi | + ,
2

(44)

and consider the number Nk− equal to 1 plus the number of elements in the set

(45)

Notice that this time, ignoring the constraint that the elements mi of each sequence sum to
zero (34) makes an in-equivalence relation between N(a) and Nk− a priori not known. But
let us postpone this problem for a moment. Using the same construction as above, we find
the recurrence relation satisfied by Nk− ,
−
Nk− = 2Nk−2

The unique solution is

A lower bound for N(a) is the number N ′ −
k of the elements of Mk which additionally satisfy
m1 + ... + mn = 0,
−

N ′ k ≤ N(a).

(48)

A statistical physics argument giving the value of the desired number N ′ −
k is as follows (this
argument is due to Meissner, who also provided an exact proof in [11]). We can think of
each sequence (m1 , ..., mn ) as of a sequence of random steps on a line. The total length of
10

each path is bounded by k owing to the inequality in the definition of the set Mk− . The
number of sequences in Mk− of a given, fixed value of the sum
m1 + ... + mn = δ

(49)

depends on δ. The average value of δ is δ̄ = 0. For large values of k, the number of the
paths corresponding to the random walk distance δ should be given by the Gaussian function

corresponds to δ = 0.
Summarizing,

where the numbers Nk− and Nk+ were calculated in (43, 47). Therefore the entropy is
bounded in the following way

(52)

We are in a position now, to compare our results with those of [8]. The mistake made in [8]
in the combinatorial formulation (see (44) in that paper) is an assumption, that one can order
the ji labels in (23) such that j1 ≤ ... ≤ jn , and impose this as a constraint on ‘admissible’
states we count. As a consequence, the number of the states contributing to the entropy
was underestimated: the analysis of [8] implied that for large a the leading contribution to
the number of sequences comes only from the sequences (m1 , ..., mn ) = (± 21 , ..., ± 12 ). The
resulting number SABCK (a) proposed for the value of the entropy was
SABCK (a) =

ln 2
√ 2 a + O(a).
4π 3γℓPl

(53)

The comparison with our (52) shows that the contribution from the higher half integers
|mi | > 12 can not be neglected.
The next consequence of the estimate (52) is a necessary condition for the agreement
of the entropy S(a) with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy a / 4ℓ2Pl ; the condition is that the
value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter γ is bounded in the following way,

sequences (±1/2, ..., ±1/2) was

(55)

In the accompanying paper [11] the recurrence relations (46,41) are generalized to an
appropriate generalized recurrence relation satisfied by the desired number N(a) itself. Next,
the combinatorial problem formulated in the previous section is solved completely. The
method is remarkably powerful. The result of [11] is
S(a) =

The numerical value of γM is calculated in [11].
An interesting historical remark is (it has been unraveled to us recently, after our results
were derived) that before coming to their final result (53, 55), Ashtekar, Baez and Krasnov
had established certain estimate. The inequality had been
γ0 a
+ O(a)
(58)
Sbh (a) ≤
γ 4ℓ2Pl
where the constant γ0 had been defined by the same equation as as γM above. But since this
result emerged as an upper bound only, finally it was replaced by the improper one (53,55).

V. THE SPIN PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

Given any value a of the classical horizon area, and the N(a) quantum states of the
horizon labeled by all the finite sequences (m1 , ..., mn ) of the non-zero half-integers such
that (36) one can fix any arbitrary
1
0 6= m ∈ Z
2
and consider the subset of states corresponding to the sequences such that
m1 = m.

(59)

(60)

Denote the number of the elements of this subset by N(a) (m). The ratio
P(a) (m) :=

N(a) (m)
N(a)

(61)

can be considered as the probability that the first puncture is labeled by m1 = m. The
question is, what P(a) (m) is when a is large compared to the minimal area am created at the
puncture4 ,
p
(62)
am = 8πγℓ2Pl |m|(|m| + 1).

(Notice, that the answer could make no probabilistic sense, if the lima→∞ P(a) (m) were 0 for
all the values of m, for example.) The number N(a) (m) defined above can be also thought
of as a number of all the finite sequences (m2 , ..., mn ) such that

By the same randon walk argument as the one used above in the treatment of the number
N ′−
k (as before, see [11] for a proof) we have
m2

N(a) (m) = e− a−am N(a − am ) + ...

(64)

where the other terms can be neglected when we go to the limit a → ∞. Since the number
N(a) is given by exponentiating (56), we can see that in the limit a → ∞
√
P(a) (m) → e−2πγM |m|(|m|+1) =: P (m).
(65)
Now, the equality (57) means that the limits P (m) of the probabilities still sum to 1,
X
P (m) = 1.

06=m∈ 12 Z

That (limit) probability distribution P (m) can also be written in terms of the entropy
S(am ) corresponding to the area am , namely
P (m) = e−S(am ) ,

(67)

regardless of whether we fix the value of γ by the agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy or not.
Acknowledgments We benefited a lot from the discussions with Abhay Ashtekar, John
Baez, Alejandro Corichi, Kirill Krasnov and Marek Napiórkowski. Krzysztof Meissner, the
referee of the diploma thesis of one us (MD), helped us to understand the relevance and
irrelevance of the constraint on the quantum excitations of the C-S field. JL was partially
supported by Polish Committee for Scientific Research (KBN) under grant number 2P03B
