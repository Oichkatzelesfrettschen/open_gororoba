                                                The AdS/CFT correspondence provides quantum theories of gravity in which
                                            spacetime and gravitational physics emerge from ordinary non-gravitational quan-
                                            tum systems with many degrees of freedom. Recent work in this context has un-
                                            covered fascinating connections between quantum information theory and quan-
                                            tum gravity, suggesting that spacetime geometry is directly related to the en-
                                            tanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical degrees of freedom
                                            and that aspects of spacetime dynamics (gravitation) can be understood from
                                            basic quantum information theoretic constraints. In these notes, we provide an
                                            elementary introduction to these developments, suitable for readers with some

                                            on lectures given at the CERN Spring School 2014, the Jerusalem Winter School

1     Introduction
Quantum mechanics is believed to be the basic underlying framework for the physics of
our universe. It is the foundation for quantum field theory, which successfully describes
the physics of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions through the Standard
Model of Particle Physics. One of the great challenges in theoretical physics over
the past decades has been trying to fit gravity, the most universal of all interactions,
into this quantum mechanical framework. While apparently of little relevance for
understanding everyday gravitational physics, coming up with a quantum theory of
gravity is essential in order to understand some of the most fundamental questions in
physics, including the physics of the big bang and the nature of black holes.
    In our modern understanding provided by Einstein’s general relativity, gravity refers
to the dynamics of spacetime and its interaction with matter as governed by the Ein-
stein Equation. To obtain a quantum version of the theory, the most direct route would
seem to be applying standard quantization rules directly to the variables describing
spacetime geometry. However, this approach typically runs into various troubles, and
there are now deep reasons to believe that the correct route to a quantum theory of
gravity must be fundamentally different. Foremost among these is the notion that
gravity is “holographic” [1, 2]. That is, given a region of spacetime, the number of
degrees of freedom is not proportional to the volume of the region (as is the case in
conventional quantum field theories) but rather to the area of the region’s boundary.
In this case, quantizing gravity as a local field theory would seem bound to fail, since
these local fluctuations of the spacetime geometry cannot be the fundamental degrees
of freedom in the same way that local fluctuations of the electromagnetic field represent
the fundamental degrees of freedom in electromagnetism.
    Great progress in our understanding of quantum gravity has come over the past
few decades from string theory, culminating in the first complete non-perturbative
models of quantum gravity provided by the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. These realize
the holographic principle directly: the quantum gravitational theories are defined as
ordinary non-gravitational quantum theories (typically quantum field theories) on a
fixed lower-dimensional spacetime. How does this work? The basic idea is that each
state of the ordinary quantum system encodes all the information about the state of
the higher-dimensional gravitational system. As examples, the vacuum state typically
corresponds to an empty spacetime, states with some low-energy excitations might
correspond to the spacetime with a few gravitational waves, while very highly excited
states of the quantum system might correspond to a spacetime with a massive black
hole.
    Since the correspondence was proposed by Maldacena in 1997, there has accumu-
lated a great deal of evidence that the conjecture is correct. However, no proof for the
correspondence exists, and there remain a number of very basic questions, such as
    • How and why do spacetime and gravity emerge from CFT physics?

    • Precisely how is the spacetime geometry and other local gravitational physics
      encoded in the CFT state?

                                           1
Figure 1: Basic AdS/CFT. States of a CFT on some fixed spacetime B correspond to
states of a gravitational theory whose spacetimes are asymptotically locally AdS with
boundary geometry B.

    • Which CFT states correspond to spacetimes with a good classical description (as
      opposed to e.g. quantum superpositions of different spacetimes).

    • What are necessary and sufficient conditions for a theory to have a gravity dual?

In recent years, it has become clear that to better understand these questions, it is very
useful to think about the CFT from the perspective of quantum information theory.
There is now a significant amount of evidence that the structure of quantum entan-
glement in the CFT state is related directly to the geometrical structure of the dual
spacetime. Natural quantum-information theoretic quantities such as entanglement
entropy and relative entropy map directly over to natural physical quantities in the
gravitational theory. Even aspects of gravitational dynamics can be seen to emerge
directly from the physics of entanglement. In these lectures, I will attempt to provide
an elementary introduction to some of these exciting recent developments.


2       The very basics of AdS/CFT
For completeness, we will start with a very rudimentary introduction to AdS/CFT.
Some useful reviews include [4, 5] but there are many others. The basic idea here is that
certain non-gravitational quantum systems, defined on fixed spacetimes, are equivalent
to quantum gravitational theories whose states correspond to different spacetimes with
specific asymptotic behavior.2 Each state in the non-gravitational system corresponds
to a state in the dual gravitational theory, and each observable in the non-gravitational
system corresponds to some observable in the gravitational theory. For both states
and observables, the interpretation on the two sides of the correspondence can be
completely different. One important exception is total energy: the energy of a CFT
state corresponds to the total energy of the spacetime (measured at the classical level
by the ADM mass).
    2
    Alternatively, we could say that they nonperturbatively define these dual gravitational theories,
since there is generally not a complete alternative definition available.


                                                 2
    In the examples that we will consider throughout these lectures, the non-gravitational
system will be a conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. a quantum field theory with con-
formal invariance, defined on some fixed spacetime B.3 Often B will be Minkowski
space Rd−1,1 or a sphere plus a time direction S d−1 × R, but we are free to choose any
geometry.
    If the CFT is “holographic,” i.e. if there is a dual gravitational theory, the various
quantum states of the CFT are each associated with some state of this dual theory, as
illustrated in figure 2. The various states may describe different spacetime geometries,
but for a specific CFT, the asymptotic behavior of each of these spacetimes is the same.
For a CFT on Minkowski space Rd−1,1 , the vacuum state of the theory corresponds to
(d + 1)-dimensional Anti-de-Sitter spacetime (AdS) with a Minkowski space boundary,
which may be described by the metric
                                             ℓ2
                                     ds2 =      (dz 2 + dxµ dxµ ) .                                  (1)
                                             z2
This is a maximally symmetric negatively-curved spacetime with curvature set by the
length scale ℓ. The spatial geometry is hyperbolic space. The spacetime has a boundary
at z = 0 which lies at an infinite proper distance from any point in space, but which
light rays can reach and return from in a finite proper time. More general excited
states of the CFT are dual to different geometries which approach this geometry as
z → 0.4 Explicitly, we can describe these more general geometries as
                                       ℓ2
                               ds2 =      (dz 2 + Γµν (x, z)dxµ dxν ) ,                              (2)
                                       z2
where for small z,
                                     Γµν (x, z) = ηµν + O(z d ) .                                    (3)
This description represents a choice of coordinates known as Fefferman-Graham co-
ordinates. For states of a CFT defined on a more general spacetime B, the story is
similar, except that ηµν in (3) is replaced by the metric describing B.
   For small perturbations to the vacuum state of the CFT, the corresponding ge-
ometries should be represented by small perturbations to AdS, while for high-energy
excited states, the corresponding spacetimes can have significantly different geometry
and even topology. One important example is the case of a thermal state of the CFT.
For the Minkowski-space CFT, the geometry corresponding to a thermal state is the
planar AdS black hole. The story is a little more interesting for CFTs defined on a
sphere. In this case, there is a deconfinement phase transition in the CFT as the tem-
perature is increased, with the low-temperature phase dual to a gas of particles in AdS
and the high-temperature phase dual to a spherically-symmetric AdS-Schwarzschild
black hole [6].
   3
     There are other examples in which the non-gravitational theory is a non-conformal field theory,
or even an ordinary quantum mechanical theory with a large number of quantum variables.
   4
     More precisely, we expect that only a subset of CFT states correspond to states of the gravitational
theory with a simple classical geometrical description. For example, a quantum superposition of two
states corresponding to two different geometries would describe a quantum superposition of geometries.

                                                   3
Figure 2: Different CFT states correspond to different asymptotically AdS geometries.

    It is interesting in general to understand which CFTs are holographic. There are
specific examples (e.g. maximally symmetric large N Yang-Mills theories) for which lots
of evidence for a dual gravitational description exists. However, we don’t have a set of
necessary and sufficient conditions to tell us whether any particular CFT is holographic.
It is believed that having a gravity dual that looks like Einstein gravity coupled to
matter requires a CFT with a large number of degrees of freedom (“large N”) and strong
coupling. There are also more detailed conditions on the spectrum of states/operators
of the theory; roughly, these conditions say that the CFT should have only as many
low-energy states as we would expect for a theory of gravity on asymptotically AdS
spacetime. On the other hand, it is plausible that any UV-complete theory of quantum
gravity on AdS can be associated with a CFT, because the gravitational observables
could be used to define a conformal field theory.


3     Entropy and geometry
The recent connections between quantum information theory and gravitational physics
actually have their roots in the early 1970s with the work of Jacob Bekenstein. In think-
ing about black holes in classical general relativity, Bekenstein and others [7, 8] realized
that the physics of black hole horizons shares qualitative features with the physics of
entropy in thermodynamics. Specifically, horizon area is non-decreasing with time (in
the classical limit), and it obeys a relation akin to the first law of thermodynamics,
dE = T dS with black hole mass playing the role of energy, 2πT identified with the sur-
face gravity κ (a measure of curvature at the horizon) and entropy identified precisely
with area as
                                             Area
                                        S↔          .                                    (4)
                                              4GN
    Based on these observations, Bekenstein made the bold suggestion that the quali-
tative similarities were not a coincidence; he postulated that black holes are thermody-

                                             4
namic systems and that the area of the horizon is the entropy of the black hole. This
was quickly confirmed by Hawking’s demonstration [9] that black holes radiate a ther-
mal spectrum of particles exactly consistent with the predicted temperature T = κ/2π.
However, the underlying statistical interpretation of the entropy as a count of states
remained mysterious for decades, since there did not exist a framework to understand
the microstates of black holes.
    Jumping ahead to the present time, we can now understand the microscopic inter-
pretation of black hole entropy for black holes in Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, since the
AdS/CFT correspondence gives us a complete definition of the underlying quantum
theory. From the previous section, a Schwarzschild black hole in Anti-de-Sitter space
is identified with a high-energy thermal state of the corresponding CFT on a sphere.
Such a theory has a discrete spectrum of energy eigenstates |Ei i, and the thermal state
corresponds to the usual canonical ensemble. This has a well-defined entropy counting
these microstates and (up to a numerical factor which is difficult to compute due to
the strong coupling in the CFT) the relation between entropy and temperature for the
CFT system is exactly what was predicted for the black hole.
    To summarize, thermal states of holographic CFTs are dual to Schwarzschild black
holes in AdS, and the CFT entropy S corresponds to the horizon area of the black hole
(divided by 4GN ). As it turns out, this particular connection between entropy and
geometry is just the tip of the iceberg. It admits a massive and beautiful generalization
proposed in 2006 by Ryu and Takayanagi. According to our present understanding, for
any CFT state corresponding to some asmptotically AdS spacetime with or without a
black hole, and for any subsystem of the CFT, the entropy of the subsystem corresponds
to a the area of a particular surface in the corresponding spacetime. Before describing
this relation in detail and discussing its implications, it will be useful to review in more
detail the description of quantum subsystems, and the associated measures of entropy.

3.1       Quantum subsystems and entanglement
Consider a quantum system with a subsystem A.5 We will denote the complement of
this subsystem by Ā. Then the Hilbert space may be decomposed as

                                           H = HA ⊗ HĀ                                   (5)

Given a state |Ψi ∈ H of the full system, we can ask: “What is the state of the
subsystem A?” Naively, we might think that it is possible to find some state |ψ A i ∈ HA
that captures all information about the subsystem. We might demand that for every
operator OA acting on HA alone,

                                 hψ A |OA |ψ A i = hΨ|OA ⊗ 11|Ψi .                        (6)

However, for general |Ψi, there does not exist such a state |ψ A i. In the context of the
larger system, the state of the subsystem is not described by any single state in the
Hilbert space HA .

                                                   5
Ensembles of quantum states
To properly describe the subsystem, we need to use the idea of an ENSEMBLE of
states, alternatively known as a MIXED STATE (as opposed to a PURE STATE i.e. a
single Hilbert space vector). That is, we consider a collection {(|ψi i, pi )} of orthogonal
states and associated probabilities. We define the expectation value of an operator O
in the ensemble to be the average of the expectation values for the individual states,
weighted by the probabilities,
                                           X
                             hOiensemble ≡     pi hψi |O|ψi i .                          (7)
                                                 i

We can think of the probabilities pi as representing some classical uncertainty about
the state of the system.
    It turns out that for a multipart system, given any state |Ψi of the entire system
(or, more generally an ensemble of states for the full system), we can always find an
ensemble of states for subsystem A such that all expectation values of operators OA
are reproduced, i.e. such that
                                           X
                          hΨ|OA ⊗ 11|Ψi =     pi hψiA |OA |ψiA i .                  (8)
                                                  i

We will prove this below by explicitly constructing the ensemble from |Ψi .

The density matrix
Given such an ensemble, we can define an associated operator
                                    X
                               ρA ≡     pi |ψiA ihψiA |                                        (9)
                                             i

known as the DENSITY OPERATOR or DENSITY MATRIX for the subsystem. The
density matrix is a Hermitian operator with unit trace and non-negative eigenvalues pi .
In fact, any operator with these properties can be used to define an ensemble by taking
|ψi i and pi to be the orthogonal eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix.6 Thus, the
density matrix provides an equivalent mathematical representation of an ensemble. To
compute the expectation value of an operator using the density matrix, we simply take
a trace:                                       X
                          hOA i = tr(OA ρA ) =   pi hψiA |OA |ψiA i .               (10)
                                                      i

   6
    When some of the pi s coincide, we need to make a choice for the orthogonal eigenvectors in the
subspace with eigenvalue pi . Expectation values of operators in the ensemble do not depend on this
choice, so all such ensembles are equivalent.




                                                 6
Calculating the density matrix for a subsystem
Starting from a state Ψ for the full system, it is straightforward to determine the
density matrix corresponding to a subsystem and thus the associated ensemble. Given
some basis {|ψn i} for A and {|ψN i} for Ā, we can represent the state of the full system
as                                   X
                              |Ψi =      cn,N |ψn i ⊗ |ψN i ,                          (11)
                                             n,N

where cc,N are complex coefficients satisfying the normalization condition
                                    X
                                        |cn,N |2 = 1 .                                (12)
                                             n,N

Then the operator ρ = |ΨihΨ| represents the density matrix for the whole system.
Taking the expectation value of an operator OA ⊗ 11 acting on our subsystem, we have
                                 XX
          tr((OA ⊗ 11)ρ) = tr(          c∗m,M cn,N OA |ψn ihψm | ⊗ |ψN ihψM |)
                                         n,N m,M
                                         X   X
                                = tr(              c∗m,N cn,N OA |ψn ihψm |)
                                         n,m N
                                = tr(OA ρA )                                          (13)

where                              XX
                            ρA ≡             c∗m,N cn,N |ψn ihψm | ≡ trĀ ρ .         (14)
                                   n,m   N

The calculation (13) shows that for the density matrix ρA defined by the operation
(14), known taking the PARTIAL TRACE over the subsystem Ā, the property (8)
holds. This proves the claim that any quantum subsystem can always be represented
by an ensemble.
   It is easy to check that equation (14) also defines a subsystem density matrix (or
REDUCED DENSITY MATRIX) with the desired properties in the case when the full
system is in an ensemble.

Thermodynamic ensembles and entropy
The notion of an ensemble is familiar from quantum statistical mechanics.
    The MICROCANONICAL ENSEMBLE is defined as {(|Ei i, pi = 1/n)}, consisting
of all energy eigenstates of a system within some small range of energies [E, E + dE],
each weighted with equal probability. We consider this ensemble when it is desired
to understand the expected values of various physical quantities when only the overall
energy for some closed system is known, but not the precise state. Our ignorance of
this “microstate” can be quantified by ENTROPY as7

                                               S = log n .                            (15)
  7
      We use units for which the Boltzmann constant kB is equal to one.

                                                    7
This serves as a measure of the number of microstates in the given energy range; the
logarithm is chosen so that the entropy of a non-interacting multipart system is the
sum of the entropies for the parts. We can think of each state as giving an individual
contribution
                                          1
                               Sstate = log n = −p log p                            (16)
                                          n
to the entropy. Assuming that this contribution to the entropy from such a state is the
same for more general ensembles where the probabilities are not all equal (i.e. that the
entropy is extensive in the space of states), we obtain the more general definition8
                                X
                          S=−         pi log pi = − tr(ρA log ρA )                  (17)
                                     i

valid for any ensemble. This general formula allows us to associate an entropy to the
ensemble describing any quantum subsystem. This serves as a measure of the classical
uncertainty arising from the mixed nature of the subsystem state.
    Another ensemble familiar from quantum statistical mechanics is the CANONICAL
ENSEMBLE or THERMAL STATE of a system. This represents a system A weakly
coupled to a heat bath which makes up the remainder Ā of the full system. The ensem-
ble can be defined by maximizing the entropy (17) subject to some fixed expectation
value for the energy of the subsystem,

                                         tr(ρA HA ) = E .                                   (18)

In terms of the energy eigenstates |E
                                   Pi i of the Hamiltonian HA , the resulting ensemble is
{(|Ei i, pi = e−βEi /Z)} where Z = i e−βEi for β chosen to ensure (18). This parameter
defines the temperature of the system via β = 1/T .

Entanglement
The need to invoke ensembles as a description of quantum subsystems is directly linked
to the notion of QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT. Indeed, we can define entanglement
by saying that a subsystem A is entangled with the rest of the system if the ensemble
describing it has probabilities {pi } 6= 1. When the subsystem is not entangled, there
is a single pure state |ψ A i ∈ HA that describes it. In this case, we can write the state
of the full system (assuming it is pure) as

                                     |Ψi = |ψ A i ⊗ |ψ Ā i .                               (19)

Thus, entanglement can alternatively be defined as the failure of the full system to be
representable as a product state.
  8
  The latter formula for the entropy in terms of the density matrix is usually referred to as the
VON NEUMANN ENTROPY of a density matrix.




                                                8
Measures of entanglement
Some entangled states are more entangled than others. For example, in a system of
two spins, the state
                            A| ↑i ⊗ | ↑i + B| ↓i ⊗ | ↓i                      (20)
is not entangled if A or B vanish, and entangled otherwise, but it is sensible to say
that the state is more entangled when the magnitudes of A and B are similar than
when the state is very close to one of the unentangled states. It is useful to come up
with measures to quantify the degree of entanglement for a subsystem.
    Since having entanglement is the same as having classical uncertainty about the
state of the subsystem, one natural measure of entanglement is simply the subsystem
entropy (17) that quantifies this classical uncertainty. Since it also serves as a measure
of entanglement, this subsystem entropy is alternatively known as ENTANGLEMENT
ENTROPY.
    A more general set of quantities useful in characterizing entanglement are the
RENYI ENTROPIES, defined as
                                 1      X        1
                         Sα =       log   pαi =     log tr(ρα ) .                             (21)
                                1−α     i
                                                1−α

These are typically defined for integer α, but by considering general real values of α,
we can recover the entanglement entropy in the limit α → 1. The Renyi entropies
for the integer values of α tend to be easier to compute than entanglement entropy.
Knowing the Renyi entropies for all integer values of α up to the dimension of the
Hilbert space is equivalent to knowing the full set of probabilities {pi }, also known as
the ENTANGLEMENT SPECTRUM.9

Purifications
We have seen that given any pure state |Ψi of a quantum system, any subsystem A
can be described by a density matrix ρA or equivalently an ensemble {(|ψiA i, pi )}. It is
sometimes useful to consider the reverse question: given an ensemble ρA for a quantum
system, can we find a pure state of some larger system such that ρA is the reduced
density matrix for the subsystem A?
   In general there are an infinite number of such PURIFICATIONS. For an ensemble
ρ = {(|ψiA i, pi )} in a Hilbert space HA , we can describe a general purification by
                                        X√
                                  |Ψi =       pi |ψiA i ⊗ |ψiB i                      (22)

where {|ψiB i} are an orthogonal set of states in some Hilbert space HB whose dimension
is at least as large as the number of non-zero eigenvalues of ρ. The state represented

in this form is known as a SCHMIDT DECOMPOSITION; it is possible to represent
any state of a combined system in this way.
    Starting from the expression (22) it is useful to note that the ensemble describing
the subsystem B has precisely the same probabilities (i.e. entanglement spectrum) as
the ensemble describing A. It follows immediately that the entanglement entropy is
the same for a subsystem and its complement when the full system is in a pure state.
    One example of the idea of a purification is the idea that a thermal state (i.e. a
system in the canonical ensemble) arises by considering the system weakly coupled to
a much larger system known as a heat bath. The full system including the bath is
taken to be a pure state and the entropy of the thermal ensemble can be understood
as measuring entanglement with the bath.
    It is sometimes useful to consider a simpler purification of the canonical ensemble,
obtained by choosing the purifying system to be a copy of the original system and
considering the state
                                1 X −βEi /2

This state, known as the THERMOFIELD DOUBLE state, is precisely symmetrical
between the two subsystems, giving a thermal state with the same temperature upon
reduction to either subsystem.

3.2       Two-sided black holes in AdS/CFT
Let’s now return to thinking about gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We
mentioned earlier that a Schwarzschild black hole in AdS is described via AdS/CFT
by a high-energy thermal state of the CFT on a sphere, and that the area of the black
hole horizon can be identified with the entropy of the CFT.
    Various observables computed in the CFT thermal state tell us about the black
hole spacetime. It is interesting to be more precise and understand which part of the
black hole we can learn about. Is it just the region outside the horizon, some of the
physics behind the horizon, or the entire maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry
(which includes two asymptotic regions connected by a wormhole)?
    In a 2001 paper [11], Maldacena argued that the maximally extended spacetime,
depicted in figure 3, is most naturally associated not with the thermal state of a single
CFT, but rather with the thermofield double state (23) of a two-CFT system.10 The
geometry has two asymptotic regions, each with its own boundary sphere and its own
black hole exterior. Correspondingly, the thermofield double state invoves two separate
CFTs on a sphere, each defined on a sphere and in a thermal state. Further, this
special purification of the thermal state is symmetrical between the two systems, like
the extended black hole geometry.
    The proposal of Maldacena is very natural but has dramatic implications. The
individual terms in the superposition (23) are product states in a system of two non-
interacting CFTs. In these states, the two theories have absolutely nothing to do with
 10
      It is possible to give a direct path-integral argument for this. See [12] and references therein.


                                                    10

one another, so in the gravity picture, these states must correspond to two completely
separate asymptotically AdS spacetimes. On the other hand, the quantum superposi-
tion of these states in (23) apparently corresponds to the extended black hole, where
the two sides of the geometry are connected by smooth classical spacetime in the form
of a wormhole. The remarkable conclusion (emphasized in [13, 14]) is that by taking
a specific quantum superposition of disconnected spacetimes, we obtain a connected
spacetime, as depicted in figure 4. Alternatively, we can say that by entangling the
degrees of freedom underlying the two separate gravitational theories in a particular
way, we have glued together the corresponding geometries!
    The extended black hole picture gives us a new way to think about the entropy-area
connection for black holes. In the thermofield double state, the black hole entropy is
the entropy of a single CFT subsystem or the entanglement entropy measuring the
entanglement of the two subsystems with each other. On the gravity side, the horizon
is a surface that divides the spatial geometry into two parts, with each part containing
one boundary sphere. It is the unique such surface in the spacetime that extremizes
the area functional. Thus, denoting the two CFT subsystems as A and Ā, we can
restate the entropy-area connection for the black hole as follows: the entropy of the
subsystem A (or the entanglement entropy of A) corresponds to the area of the extremal-
area surface dividing the bulk geometry into two parts with boundaries A and Ā. This
version leads us immediately to the remarkable generalization by Ryu and Takayanagi,
which postulates this to hold for any region A in any state with a dual geometry.

superposition of disconnected spacetimes gives a connected spacetime.

3.3    The Ryu-Takayanagi formula
In the context of AdS/CFT, the Bekenstein formula provides a geometrical interpreta-
tion for the total entropy of a CFT in a high-energy thermal state, identifying it with
the area of the horizon of the black hole in the dual spacetime. The formula proposed
by Ryu and Takayanagi [15] (and generalized to a covariant version by Hubeny, Ranga-
mani, and Takayanagi [16]) suggests an interpretation for the entropy of any spatial
subsystem of the CFT, for any CFT state associated with some classical spacetime.
    To state the proposal, consider a holographic CFT defined on a spacetime geometry
B. We suppose that the CFT is in a state |Ψi associated with a classical dual geometry
MΨ . We now consider an arbitrary spatial subsystem A of the CFT, defined by first
choosing a spatial slice ΣB of B and then choosing a subset A ⊂ ΣB of this slice.
The spatial region A can be connected or a union of disconnected regions. Since the
boundary geometry ∂MΨ of MΨ is the same as B, we can define regions on ∂MΨ
corresponding to ΣB , A, and Ā ⊂ ΣB (and we will use the same letters to refer to
these).
    Now, let SA be the entropy of the subsystem A i.e. the entanglement entropy
measuring the entanglement of fields in A with the the rest of the system. The covariant
version of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal states that this entropy equals the area of a
certain codimension-2 surface Ã in MΨ (i.e. d − 1-dimensional for a geometry that is
asymptotically AdSd+1 )
                                           1
                                 S(A) =       Area(Ã) .                            (24)
                                          4GN
The surface Ã is defined by the following conditions:

   • The surface Ã has the same boundary as A.

   • The surface Ã is homologous to A. This means that A and Ã together form the
     boundary of some d-dimensional spacelike surface in MΨ . This condition together
     with the previous condition are equivalent to saying that the surface Ã divides
     some bulk spatial slice ending on ΣB into two parts, such that ΣB splits into A
     and Ã.

Figure 5: Geometrical features relevant to the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal. In the dia-
gram, the time direction has been suppressed. The left side shows a spatial slice ΣB
of the spacetime B on which the CFT lives. The right side shows a spatial slice of the
spacetime MΨ dual to the state |Ψi, containing ΣB and the extremal surface Ã.

   • The surface Ã extremizes the area functional. If there are multiple such surfaces,
     Ã is the one with least area.
    The proposal is depicted in figure 5. A nice aspect of the proposal is that it relates
completely universal quantities on the two sides of the correspondence. Entanglement
entropy can be defined for any CFT, while on the gravity side, the area of extremal
surfaces is purely geometrical and thus relevant in any gravitational theory.

Minimal area surfaces
In the special case of a static geometry11 , we can ignore the time direction and say
that the entanglement entropy for a boundary region A is computed as the area of the
minimal-area surface in the bulk space with the same boundary as A. This was the
original Ryu-Takayanagi proposal before the covariant generalization above.
    More generally, assuming the geometry MΨ satisfies the null energy condition, the
covariant prescription above is equivalent finding the minimal-area surface on a spatial
slice Σ bounded by ΣB , but then maximizing this area over all possible slices Σ [17].
This “maximin” construction turns out to be very useful in proving certain results
about holographic entanglement entropy.

QFT entanglement and divergences
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula as it is usually stated is somewhat ill-defined, since both
sides of the equation actually represent divergent quantities. On the gravity side, the
area Ã is divergent because there is an infinite proper distance to the boundary of AdS.
  11
     More generally, these comments apply to a geometry with time reflection symmetry about a spatial
slice ending on ΣB when we restrict to this slice.

                                                 13
    To understand the divergence on the field theory side, note that the subsystem we
are talking about (i.e. the subset of field degrees of freedom living in some spatial
region A) actually contains an infinite number of degrees of freedom, since we have
field modes with arbitrarily short wavelengths. The field modes on either side of
the region boundary ∂A are coupled to each other by the field theory Hamiltonian,
and are entangled with each other in the field theory ground state. Summing the
contribution to the entanglement entropy from these infinite number of modes, we
obtain a divergence typically proportional to the area of the boundary of A for two or
more spatial dimensions.
    To make a sense out of the RT formula, we have several options. First, we can
work with a UV cutoff in the field theory at some high scale 1/ǫ. In the AdS/CFT
correspondence, this corresponds to an IR cutoff, where we keep only the z > ǫ part
of the geometry. With the explicit cutoff, both the CFT entanglement and the area
on the gravity side become finite, and when explicit calculations are possible, the two
results can be shown to match, up to terms which vanish as the cutoff is removed. We
will give one explicit example of this matching below.
    Alternatively, we can take the usual approach in quantum field theory and work
with quantities that remain finite as the cutoff is removed. There are several options

  1. We can consider certain combinations of entanglement entropies for which the
     divergences cancel. For example S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B), which defines the
     MUTUAL INFORMATION between A and B. We can use this to obtain a
     regulated version of 2S(A) by choosing B to be all the points with distance ≥ ǫ
     from A.

  2. For excited states, we can consider the entanglement entropy relative to the
     vacuum entanglement entropy, SA (|Ψi) − SA (|vaci).

  3. We can look at certain derivatives of the entanglement entropy with respect to
     some parameters describing the region. For example, for an interval of length L
     in 1+1 dimensions, we can look at dS/dL.

In each of these cases, we can work with a cutoff, perform the calculations, and then
remove the cutoff in the end to obtain a finite result.

Example
As a simple example, we can consider the calculation of entanglement entropy for a
ball-shaped region B for a CFT in the vacuum state on Rd−1,1 . In this case, the dual
geometry is Poincaré AdS

                        ℓ2

                        z2
We need to find the extremal-area (d − 1)-dimensional surface in the geometry whose
boundary is the same as the boundary of the ball B, which we choose to be at (xi )2 = R2

                                           14
and t = 0. Since the geometry is static, we expect that the bulk extremal surface should
lie in the t = 0 slice.
     If we parameterize a (d − 1) dimensional surface as X µ (σ), the (d − 1)-dimensional
area functional is                      Z       p

to be the spatial coordinates xi , so that the surface is parameterized as Z(xi ) with
T (xi ) = 0. In this case, the induced metric reduces to

It is straightforward to write down the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and
check that the minimal area solutions ending on the spheres (xi )2 = R2 are the bulk

                                  (xi )2 + z 2 = R2 .                           (30)
Now, we need to calculate the area of the extremal surface. We will work in d = 2 as
an explicit example. To regulate the divergence associated with the infinite distance
to the AdS boundary, we will calculate the area of the surface in the region z > ǫ for
some small ǫ. We have
                                                                 

where we have defined L = 2R since the “ball” of radius R is simply an interval of
length 2L.
   We can now compare this to a direct calculation of the entanglement entropy in
the vacuum state of a two-dimensional CFT. We recall that CFTs are characterized by
a central charge c which serves as a measure of the number of degrees of freedom. It
turns out that there is a universal formula for the entanglement entropy of an interval
  12
    For the special case we are considering, there are more elegant ways of obtaining this result.
For example, by a conformal transformation, the boundary of the ball can be mapped to the line
x1 = 0. The extremal surface ending on this line is simply the bulk surface x1 = 0. Applying the bulk
coordinate transformation corresponding to the reverse conformal transformation, this surface maps
to a hemisphere.

This is indeed the known relation between the central charge and the gravitational
parameters for examples of the AdS3 /CF T2 correspondence. It can be established
independently by comparing other physical observables such as the relation between
entropy and temperature in thermal states.
    The agreement here is actually more than we would have expected in general. In
general, we would expect gravity calculations to be reproduced only for CFTs with a
gravity dual description. It just happens that the result for the entanglement entropy
of a single interval takes the same form for all CFTs. For more general quantities, such
as the entanglement entropy of a union of disjoint intervals, the CFT result depends on
the details of the CFT, and only for special holographic CFTs does the result match
with a gravity calculation [19, 20].
    As we discussed earlier, while the result (32) is cutoff-dependent, there are various
UV finite quantities that we can derive from this:

  1. First, we can take combinations of entanglement entropies for which the diver-
     gences cancel. An example is provided by the mutual information for a holo-
     graphic CFT in the vacuum state between two intervals A and B, which we
     will take to be of length L separated by distance R. In this case, the mutual
     information is
                           I(A : B) = S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B)                   (34)

                                           16
   where from (32), we have

                                                 c    L
                               S(A) = S(B) =       log .                          (35)
                                                 3    ǫ
   To calculated S(A∪B) holographically, we actually need to consider two different
   possible extremal surfaces with boundary ∂(A  √ ∪ B), both a disconnected union of
   two parts, as shown in figure 6. For R > ( 2 − 1)L, the minimal-area extremal
   surface is simply the union of surfaces Ã and B̃ computing S(A) and√S(B), so
   the mutual information vanishes (at leading order in 1/N). For R < ( 2 − 1)L,
   the alternative (red) extremal surface has less area. Thus, we have
                           c     R+2L    c     R
                                                                 √
             S(A ∪ B) = 3c

                                 L
                                   ǫ
                                     c
                                       + 3

                                           L
                                               ǫ
                                                          R  < ( √2 − 1)L .      (36)

                             log ǫ + 3 log ǫ              R > ( 2 − 1)L

   Combining our results as in (34), we obtain for the leading large N behavior of
   the mutual information
                                                          √
                             c
                               log R(R+2L)
                                        2            R < (√2 − 1)L
                I(A : B) =   3        L                                       (37)
                             0                       R > ( 2 − 1)L

   which is finite, as promised, and has an interesting first order phase transition as
   the separation between the intervals is increased.

2. We can also consider the entanglement entropy for excited states, subtracting off
   the vacuum entanglement entropy for the same region. For example, consider
   the thermal state of the CFT with temperature β. The entanglement entropy in
   this state can be calculated [18] using a similar path-integral approach as for the
   vacuum calculation (described in appendix C), or for holographic theories, using
   the Ryu-Takayanagi formula applied to the BTZ black hole geometry (150). As
   for the vacuum case, the result is universal, depending only on the central charge
   of the CFT.
   The divergent part of the entanglement entropy is the same as for the vacuum
   case, and subtracting the two, we find for an interval of length L,
                                                          
                                        c       β       πL
                           Sβ − Svac = log         sinh                     (38)
                                        3      πL        β

   In cases where L is significantly larger than β, This gives
                                             πc
                               Sβ − Svac ∼      L = s(β)L                         (39)
                                             3β

   where s(β) is ordinary thermodynamic entropy density for the CFT at tempera-
   ture β −1 . Thus, (39) gives exactly the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem.



                                        17
  3. Finally, we can simply take the derivative of the entanglement entropy with
     respect to the size of the system, which gives the finite result
                                          dS    c
                                             =                                      (40)
                                          dL   3L
      In higher dimensions, there are various ways to deform the shape of an region,
      and various possibilities for differential quantities that are UV finite (see, for
      example [21] and [22]).

3.4    Evidence for Ryu-Takayanagi
Here, we mention a few pieces of evidence for the correctness of the Ryu-Takayanagi
proposal.
    We have already seen that the formula is correct when applied to an interval in the
vacuum state or a thermal state of a holographic 2D CFT. Similar agreement can be
shown for the case of multiple intervals in the vacuum state of holographic 2D CFTs
[19, 20], for an interval in the thermal state of 2D CFTs, for ball-shaped regions in the
vacuum of higher-dimensional CFTs [23], for ball-shaped regions in CFTs deformed by
relevant operators [24], and for certain shape-deformations of these ball-shaped regions
(see e.g. [25]).
    In general, direct calculational checks are limited by our ability to calculated en-
tanglement entropy in strongly coupled CFTs. However, it is possible to provide a
general argument for the validity of the proposal starting directly from the assumed
equivalence between the CFT and gravity partition functions that lies at the heart
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The argument makes use of the fact that the CFT
entanglement entropy is a limiting case of the Renyi entropies (21). As explained in
appendix C, these can be calculated by evaluating the CFT path integral on a multi-
sheeted Euclidean space defined by gluing multiple copies of the original boundary
space together across the regions for which the entropy is being evaluated. According
to the AdS/CFT correspondence, this field theory path integral should equal the path
integral for the gravity theory on asymptotically AdS spacetimes with boundary ge-
ometry equal to the multi-sheeted space appearing in the CFT path integral. In the
classical limit, the gravity path integral is dominated by a single saddle-point geome-
try, which is the solution to the classical gravitational equations with these boundary
conditions. The result is then e−Sgrav evaluated for this solution. Thus, we have a
way in principle to compute Renyi entropies and therefore entanglement entropies by
solving a gravity problem, without assuming the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. In general,
finding the required solutions to compute the Renyi entropy Sn would be a difficult
problem requiring numerics. However, in the limit n → 1 needed to compute entan-
glement entropies, Lewkowycz and Maldacena have argued (in the case of static or
time-reflection symmetric spacetimes) [26] that the problem reduces to precisely the
problem of computing extremal surface areas in the original geometry. The argument
has recently been extended to the time-dependent case by [27].


                                           18
Figure 7: Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces computing entanglement entropy for complemen-
tary regions A and Ā in the thermal state on S d dual to a black hole. For small enough
A, the minimal-area extremal surface corresponding to Ã becomes the union of Ã with
the black hole horizon.

Entanglement entropy for complementary subsystems
The holographic entanglement entropy formula also obeys various consistency checks.
We recall that for any pure state of a system with subsystems A and Ā, the entangle-
ment entropy of A matches with the entanglement entropy of Ā:

                          S(A) = S(Ā)            |ΨiA∪Ā pure                       (41)

In the RT formula, the calculation of the entanglement entropy for a region A involves
finding the minimal area bulk extremal surface whose boundary is the same as the
boundary of A. But the boundary of Ā is the same as the boundary of A. Thus, the
minimal-area extremal surface is the same for both cases, and we will get the same
entanglement entropy, provided that such a surface is homologous to both A and Ā.
The latter condition requires that A and Ā are homologous in the full geometry, which
is equivalent to saying that the bulk geometry has no boundary components other than
A ∪ Ā.
    An example where A and Ā can fail to be homologous is the case where the bulk
geometry is a black hole. For example, in the maximally extended black hole geometry,
A will not be homologous to Ā since there is a second asymptotic region with its own
boundary. In this case, the entanglement entropy for A and Ā will be computed by
separate surfaces (see figure 7) and will generally be different. But this is exactly what
we expect, since the state of the CFT on A ∪ Ā is no longer pure so (41) doesn’t apply.
    An interesting example is provided by the case where A is a small region and Ā
makes up the remainder of the sphere, with the CFT on the sphere taken to be in
some high-energy thermal state. In this case, the extremal surface corresponding to
the region A will remain close to the AdS boundary. For Ā even though the boundary
of Ā is small, the extremal surface must “wrap around” the black hole (as shown in
figure 7) in order to be homologous to Ā. In this case, it turns out that the minimal
area extremal surface is actually not connected, but rather a disconnected surface made
up of the union of Ã with the black hole horizon. In this case we have the interesting

                                           19
relation that
                                        S(Ā) = S(A) + SBH .                                         (42)

Subadditivity and mutual information
For general quantum systems with disjoint subsystems A and B, it is straightforward
to demonstrate that13

                             I(A; B) ≡ S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B) ≥ 0                                    (43)

This quantity, known as MUTUAL INFORMATION is a measure of entanglement and
correlations between the two subsystems A and B. The fact that it is always positive
is known as the SUBADDITIVITY of entanglement entropies. Mutual information
provides an upper bound for all correlations between the two subsystems; if OA and
OB are two bounded operators acting on HA and HB , it can be shown that [28]

                                (hOA OB i − hOA ihOB i)2
                                                         ≤ I(A; B) .                                 (44)
                                   2|hOA i|2 |hOB i|2

    In a CFT, taking A and B to be disjoint spatial subsystems, the combination of
entanglement entropies in 43 is finite, so the positivity constraint is meaningful. Using
the holographic formula (24) this translates to a condition on the areas of surfaces; as
a consistency check, we should verify that this is satisfied. Given the extremal surfaces
Ã and B̃ for A and B, the surface Ã∪ B̃ is an extremal surface with the same boundary
as A ∪ B. The surface that computes the entanglement entropy S(A ∪ B) is defined
to be the minimal-area extremal surface with the same boundary as A ∪ B. Thus, its
area must be less than or equal to the area of of Ã ∪ B̃, and the subadditivity relation
(43) follows immediately.

Strong subadditivity
More constraints arise when we consider additional subsystems. For general quantum
systems with disjoint subsystems A, B, and C entanglement entropy obeys the relation

                      S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C) ≥ 0 ,                                (45)

known as STRONG SUBADDITIVITY. This can be reexpressed in terms of mutual
information as
                      I(A; B ∪ C) ≥ I(A; B) ,                        (46)
i.e. that the mutual information between A and the combined system BC must be
larger than the mutual information between A and B. This sounds very plausible, but
it turns out that the proof of strong subadditivity is rather difficult.
    Again, we can ask whether the holographic formula for entanglement entropy re-
spects this. For static geometries and regions A, B, and C all on a preferred time slice,
 13
      For a more detailed discussion on the entanglement constraints in this and later sections, see [10].

                                                    20
where we can use the original RT formula, the geometrical version of strong subaddi-
tivity may be easily demonstrated to hold for any geometry, as shown by Headrick and
Takayanagi [29]. If we consider regions on more general time slices, or time-dependent
geometries, the strong subadditivity relation is much more difficult to demonstrate, and
in fact only holds when the geometry satisfies certain conditions. While the necessary
conditions on the geometry are not known in general, it has been shown that the null
energy condition is sufficient [17].

3.5    Generalizations of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula should be understood as holding in a particular limit
where the gravitational theory is well-described by classical Einstein gravity coupled
to matter (without curvature couplings). Of course, the entanglement entropy is a
precisely defined quantity (up to the issue of divergences) for any CFT, so we might
expect some version of the RT formula to hold even away from this limit of classical
Einstein gravity.
    For classical theories of gravity which are not Einstein gravity, there is a well-
known generalization of the entropy-area connection for black holes due to Wald [30].
In this case, area is replaced by a more general covariant quantity calculated for the
black hole horizon. The appropriate quantity can be determined directly from the
form of the gravitational Lagrangian. It is natural to suppose that this more general
quantity also replaces area in the holographic entanglement formula. It turns out that
the full story is slightly more complicated, since there can be additional terms that
make no contribution when evaluated on a black hole horizon. However, there are now
precise proposals [31, 32] for the correct quantity, based on the Lewkowycz-Maldacena
derivation of the RT formula applied to these more general theories.
    Away from large N, there will also be quantum effects in the bulk theory. The lead-
ing corrections to the classical limit are captured by “semiclassical gravity,” in which
we include the effects of quantum fluctuations of the metric and other fields via a quan-
tum field theory living on the spacetime geometry. At this level of approximation, we
can think of CFT states |Ψi as corresponding to some geometry M plus some quan-
tum field theory state |ψbulk i defined on M. On the CFT side, effects associated with
these quantum field fluctuations correspond to 1/N corrections. For the entanglement
entropy, this means that the entanglement entropy will have some leading asymptotic
behavior in large N plus subleading terms suppressed by powers of 1/N. Faulkner,
Leukowycz, and Maldacena have proposed [33] that the leading 1/N correction to en-
tanglement entropy in the field theory corresponds to the entanglement entropy of the
bulk quantum fields across the extremal surface Ã
                                        1
                            SACF T =       Area(Ã) + SÃbulk .                     (47)
                                       4GN
For a continuum quantum field theory, the second term would have a divergence pro-
portional to the area of Ã, but in the context of a quantum gravitational theory, we


                                            21
expect that there is a natural UV cutoff provided by the Planck scale that renders this
term finite.

3.6     Implications of the holographic entanglement entropy for-
        mula
We conclude this section with some qualitative remarks on the plausible implications
of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.

Reconstructing the geometry
An important implication of the holographic entanglement entropy formula is that
much of the dual spacetime geometry for a holographic CFT state is encoded in the
entanglement structure of the state. In principle, we can recover the dual spacetime
geometry by calculating entanglement entropies for many different regions and then
finding a geometry M whose extremal surface areas match with the entropies. This
should be a highly overconstrained problem, since the entanglement entropies give us
some function on the space of subsets of the boundary spacetime, while geometries M
are specified by a handful of functions of a few coordinates (a much smaller space).
Thus, for a general state in a general CFT, we should expect that no geometry will
reproduce all the entanglement entropies.
    Having a geometrical dual will therefore require a very special structure of entan-
glement for the CFT state. Given such a state, we can expect that the entanglement
entropies fix the geometry uniquely, with some limitations. Most importantly, there
can be regions of a spacetime, such as the region behind the horizon of a black hole,
where no extremal surface penetrates. If a CFT state is dual to some geometry with
such a region, known as the ENTANGLEMENT SHADOW (see e.g. [34] for a dis-
cussion), we will clearly not be able to learn about this region by computing spatial
entanglement entropies. It may be that the information about the geometry in these
regions may be contained in more general types of entanglement (see e.g. [35, 36]).14

Spacetime from entanglement
In the example of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole, the the two CFTs
have nothing to do with one another except that their states are entangled via the
thermofield double state. In that example, it is clear that this entanglement is a nec-
essary condition for the two asymptotic regions of the dual spacetime to be connected.
Without entanglement, we have a product state in two non-interacting systems, and
the only possible interpretation would be two disconnected spacetimes.
  14
    It is possible to associate an entanglement entropy to any subalgebra of the full algebra of observ-
ables for a quantum system. The entanglement entropies that we have discussed so far correspond to
the full subalgebra of operators associated to spatial regions, but there are more general possibilities.
See [37] for some examples and the appendix of [38] for a general review.




                                                   22
Figure 8: Effect on the dual spatial geometry of disentangling the two hemispheres
starting from the vacuum state of a CFT on S d . Note that it is actually the bulk
metric is changing, with the boundary metric remaining fixed.

    Motivated by this, it is interesting to ask whether even in simpler spacetimes, dual to
states of a single CFT, the connectedness of the geometry is related to the large amount
of entanglement present in low-energy CFT states. To probe this, we can consider the
following thought experiment [13, 14]. Starting with the vacuum state of a CFT on the
sphere, imagine arbitrarily dividing the sphere into two hemispheres. Now, consider
a one parameter family of CFT states for which the entanglement between the two
hemispheres decreases from the initial value in the vacuum state. What happens to
the dual spacetime?
    Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we learn that as the entanglement between the
two sides decreases, the area of the surface dividing the two sides of the bulk spacetime
decreases. A separate argument suggests that the two sides also become further and
further apart. Thus, the picture is that the spatial geometry of the corresponding
spacetime stretches apart and pinches off in the middle, as shown in figure 8. This
picture can be checked by explicit calculations in some one parameter families of states
[39]. Thus, by removing the entanglement between the two halves of the CFT, it
appears that we are able to pull apart the corresponding spacetime. We can go further,
subdividing the boundary into more regions and removing the entanglement between
these. As we will see in more detail below, the result is that the spacetime splits up
into many small disconnected fragments. By removing all the entanglement (which, for
the case of a continuum CFT, costs an infinite amount of energy), the dual spacetime
disappears entirely!
    These qualitative arguments suggest a rather remarkable conclusion: quantum en-
tanglement between the underlying degrees of freedom is crucial for the existence of
classical spacetime. We might even interpret the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as telling us
that spacetime is a geometrical representation of the entanglement structure of a CFT
state [40, 13].15
  15
     There are many caveats to such a conclusion. It is an open question whether spacetime geometry
in the entanglement shadow, e.g. behind black hole horizons, can be understood this way. Also, there
are examples of holographic duality where the field theory is a simple matrix quantum mechanics. In
this case, there are no spatial subsystems, so a connection between entanglement and geometry would
have to be based on a more general type of entanglement within the system, such as those mentioned
in the previous footnote.

4     The entanglement structure of the CFT vacuum
In this section, we will begin to take a closer look at entanglement and other quantum-
information theoretic quantities in quantum field theories in order to understand how
they are related to features of the dual spacetime geometries and to gravitational
physics in these spacetimes.

Domains of dependence
Consider a local quantum field theory on some spacetime B. To define a spatial sub-
system, we first choose a spatial slice ΣB and then let A be a subset of this spatial
slice. This subset can be connected or disconnected. The fields in A represent a subset
of the degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory. This is most clear in a lattice
regularization, where we have degrees of freedom associated with specific points. There
are subtleties in the case of gauge theories; for more discussion on these, see [41, 42].
    In a relativistic quantum field theory, there is a spacetime region DA that is canon-
ically associated with the spatial subsystem A. To define DA , we note that for some
spacetime points p in B, all causal (i.e. timelike or lightlike) curves through p neces-
sarily pass through A. The region DA is the collection of all such points, known as the
DOMAIN OF DEPENDENCE of A, or alternatively as the causal development region
or causal diamond associated with A. This is illustrated in figure 9.
    At the classical level, the domain of dependence is important because it is the region
where the solution of any relativistic field equation is fully determined given initial data
on A. Changes to the fields in Ā ⊂ SΣB cannot affect this region. At the quantum
level, any operator in DA can be expressed in terms of the field operators living on
the region A, making use of the field theory Hamiltonian to evolve field operators
backwards and forwards in time. Operators in DA commute with operators localized
in Ā or DĀ .
    The domain of dependence DA associated with a region A is also the domain of
dependence for an infinite number of other spatial regions, essentially any spacelike
surface in DA whose boundary is the same as the boundary of A, as in figure 10. The
density matrix associated with any of these other regions contains the same information
as the density matrix associated with ρA , so it is useful to think of ρA as being a density

matrix associated with the whole spacetime region DA .
    The full set of operators with support in A forms a closed algebra of observables
for the field theory; in a sense, the field theory on DA represents a complete quantum
system on its own. The full state of the CFT can then be understood as an entangled
state between this system and a complementary system given by the field theory on
DĀ ,                                  X√

                                      i
This expression is a bit heuristic, since the spectrum in this case is generally not
discrete.
    The representation (48) suggests a natural decomposition of the quantum informa-
tion associated with the full state as
                         |Ψi → ρA + ρĀ + entanglement info .                      (49)
Here, it is important to note that the pair of density matrices ρA , ρĀ represent only
a subset of the information contained in the state |Ψi. The rest of the information is
contained in the details of how the two subsystems are entangled with one another in
(48).
    In our discussion below, we will see that there is a natural spacetime analog to
the decomposition (49). This can be motivated by noting that the representation (48)
bears a formal similarity to the CFT description of the two-sided black hole, where (as
we will argue below) the split (49) corresponds to the natural spacetime decomposition
into the outside-the-horizon regions on the two sides plus the black hole interior.

Density matrix for a half-space
In general, it is difficult to describe the density matrix for a spatial subsystem of a
quantum field theory, even for the vacuum state. One special exception is the case of
a half-space (e.g. x > 0, where x is one of the spatial coordinates) of Minkowski space,
whose domain of dependence is known as a RINDLER WEDGE. We can describe the
Rindler wedge as {x > 0, |t| < x} or alternatively as the region {r > 0} in the metric
                                  ds2 = dr 2 − r 2 dη 2 ,                          (50)

This wedge (and the complementary x < 0 wedge) are depicted in figure 11.
    A simple path-integral argument (see appendix C) shows that for the vacuum state
of any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the density matrix for the half space is
a thermal density matrix

We can write Hη , also known as the Rindler Hamiltonian, explicitly as
                                Z
                          Hη =         dd−1 x{xT00 (xµ )} .                         (54)

More covariantly, we can write Hη as
                                                     Z
                                           Hη =              η µ Tµν ǫν             (55)

The fact that the density matrix is thermal with respect to this Hamiltonian which
generates evolution on accelerated trajectories is related to the result of Unruh that
an accelerated observer observing the vacuum state will see a thermal spectrum of
particles.
    We can also consider the complementary Rindler wedge, associated with the spatial
region x < 0. The density matrix for this region is also thermal, with respect to the
Hamiltonian Hη′ generating boosts in this complementary wedge. The full vacuum
state of the CFT can be understood as an entangled state between the field theories
defined on the two Rindler wedges. In fact, it is exactly the thermofield double state
                                    X
                            |vaci =    e−βEi /2 |Ei i ⊗ |Ei′ i ,                   (57)

where |Ei i and |Ei′ i represent the energy eigenstates for the Hamiltonians Hη and Hη′ .
    In the case of a free field theory, we can define modes of the fields living in each
of the wedges, and build the energy eigenstates of Hη and Hη′ on the respective sides
by occupying these modes. In this case, we find that in the vacuum state (57), each
mode in one wedge is entangled with the corresponding mode in the other wedge. We
can also consider states in which this entanglement is removed, i.e. a product state
between the two wedges. For these states, we find that the stress tensor is singular at
x = t = 0 and on the boundaries of the two Rindler wedges. Thus, entanglement of the
field theory modes on either side of the x = 0 surface (or any other surface) is crucial
to obtain a well-behaved field theory state.

Density matrix for a ball-shaped region in a CFT
A Rindler wedge can be related by a conformal transformation to the domain of depen-
dence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski space.17 In a conformal field theory, such
a transformation is associated with a mapping of states that leaves the vacuum state
invariant. Thus, the vacuum density matrix for a ball-shaped region is the image under
the conformal transformation of the vacuum density matrix (52) for the Rindler wedge.
The Rindler density matrix is expressed directly in terms of a symmetry generator Hη ;
this maps under the conformal transformation to the generator of a symmetry that
acts within the domain of dependence of the ball:
                                                 1 −2πU Hη U †  1
                          ρB = UρRindler U † =     e           ≡ e−Hζ .             (58)

Note that we have absorbed the factor of 2π in (52) into the definition of Hζ .
    As an example, for the ball B of radius R centered at the origin of Minkowski space,
this symmetry is a spacetime transformation generated by the vector field

Pure AdS is a maximally extended black hole
Our results for Minkowski space translate directly to results for the vacuum state of a
single CFT on S d × R. On the spatial sphere Std at some time, consider any ball B (e.g.
a region θ < θ0 in polar coordinates) and the complementary ball B̄. Choosing some
point P on the boundary of B, let Dp̄ be the domain of dependence region of Std − P
(i.e. the complement of p on Std ). Then there is a conformal transformation that maps
Dp̄ to Minkowski space, taking DB and DB̄ to complementary Rindler wedges (defined
as the domain of dependence of a half space), as shown in figure 12.
    This conformal transformation maps the vacuum state on the sphere to the vacuum
state on Minkowski space. Thus, as in the previous section, the vacuum density matri-
ces for the balls B and B̄ are related by the conformal transformation to the vacuum
density matrix of the half space. Again, we have symmetry generators HB and HB̄
defining a notion of time evolution in DB and DB̄ such that the density matrices for
the two regions are ρB = exp(−HB )/Z and ρB̄ = exp(−HB̄ /Z). Furthermore, using

                                              28
the result (57), we can say that the vacuum state of the CFT on the sphere may be
written as the thermofield double state
                                     X
                          |vaciS d =    e−βEi /2 |EiB i ⊗ |EiB̄ i            (62)

where |EiB i and |EiB̄ i represent energy eigenstates with respect to the Hamiltonians
HB and HB̄ .
    This description of the CFT vacuum has a formal similarity to the CFT description
(23) of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole in AdS. We can make an
even closer analogy by noting that the regions DB and DB̄ can each be mapped by
another conformal transformation (see appendix B) to the static spacetime H d × R,
i.e. negatively curved hyperbolic space times time, which we can represent as
                     ds2 = −dt2 + dr 2 + RH
                                          2
                                            sinh2 (r/RH )dΩ2d−2 .                 (63)
Here, RH is length scale that sets the curvature of the hyperbolic space. Under this
transformation, the Hamiltonian HB maps to the standard CFT Hamiltonian gener-
ating evolution in the t coordinate. Thus, any state of the CFT on S d maps to an
entangled state of a pair of CFTs on H d . Specifically, the vacuum state maps to the
thermofield double state with temperature T = 1/(2πRH ), with each of the CFTs in a
thermal state.
    Our experience with thermal states of a holographic CFT on Minkowski space or on
a sphere might suggest that these hyperbolic space thermal states have something to do
with black hole dual geometries. On the other hand, the hyperbolic space thermofield
double state we have arrived at is simply an alternative description of the CFT vacuum
state on a sphere, which is dual to pure global AdS spacetime. This apparent tension
can be resolved by noting that there is a way to think of pure global AdS spacetime as
a black hole.
    To understand this, we note that any thermal state of a CFT on hyperbolic space
is indeed dual to an AdS-Schwarzshild black hole, but this time with a non-compact
horizon with the geometry of hyperbolic space. This can be represented in the standard
Schwarzschild coordinates as
                            2            2    dr 2    r2    2
                         ds = −fβ (r)dt +          + 2 dHd−1                       (64)
                                             fβ (r) ℓ
where fβ is a temperature-dependent function of r that vanishes at the black hole
horizon. However, for the special case β = 2πRH , we have fβ (r) = r 2 /ℓ2 − 1, and
it turns out that the geometry (64) describes a wedge RB of global AdS equal to the
intersection of the causal future of DB and the causal past of DB . This is a Rindler
wedge of AdS in the sense that it is the bulk domain of dependence of a half-space
bounded by the extremal surface B̃.
    We now see that pure global AdS can be thought of as a maximally extended black
hole geometry. The wedge RB represents the exterior of the hyperbolic black hole, the
complementary wedge RB̄ represents the exterior of a black hole in a second asymptotic
region, and the remaining regions to the past and future of these wedges represent the
black hole interior.

                                          29
The gravity dual of a density matrix
We have seen that given a ball-shaped region B on the sphere, we can represent the
CFT vacuum state as an entangled state between B and B̄, where the density matrices
ρB and ρB̄ are thermal density matrices for a particular temperature, and the full state
is the thermofield double state. On the bulk side, this decomposition of the quantum
state naturally corresponds to a decomposition of global AdS into two complementary
Rindler wedges plus a behind-the-horizon region; we will now explain this in more
detail.
    To motivate this correspondence, let us consider a somewhat more general question
[43, 44, 45]: given a state |Ψi dual to some geometry M, and given the reduced density
matrix ρA calculated from this state for a subsystem A, what information about the
dual spacetime is contained in A?
    Since AdS/CFT is a non-local duality, there is no reason a priori that ρA should tell
us about any particular subset of the dual geometry. It could be that the information
about any local region in the dual spacetime is completely spread throughout the CFT
degrees of freedom. In this case, no spatial CFT subsystem would contain all the
information about the bulk region. However, we will now argue that ρA does encode
the information about the bulk physics in a particular subset of the dual geometry
naturally associated with the domain of dependence region DA .
    We note first that given the density matrix ρA , we can compute the expectation
value of any local or nonlocal CFT observable contained within DA . We can also calcu-
late more general quantities, such as the entanglement entropies of spatial subsystems
within DA . Through the AdS/CFT dictionary, these provide information about the
dual geometry.

The causal wedge
As an example, we can consider response functions in the CFT, i.e. two point functions
at timelike separated points contained within DA . We can think of these as perturbing
the system at the location of the earlier operator and then measuring the response at
the location of the later operator. In the bulk picture, we can think of this operation as
making a perturbation at the boundary of AdS that propagates causally into the bulk
and then measuring the response of this perturbation at the AdS boundary at some
later time. The subset of the bulk geometry sensitive to this kind of measurement is
the intersection of the causal future of DA (the region to which we can send a signal)
and the causal past of DA (the region from which we can receive a signal). This is
known as the CAUSAL WEDGE associated with the subsystem A.
    By measuring response functions and other CFT observables, it is very plausible
that we can recover the physics in the causal wedge. For example, we can imagine
inserting an arbitrarily small mirror anywhere in the causal wedge; this would have
a significant effect on certain response functions, since now light signals from certain
boundary points would bounce directly back to other boundary points creating a very
different response. Perturbatively around AdS, we can even write explicit CFT expres-


                                           30

Figure 13: The causal wedge associated with DA (shaded) is the region for which an
observer restricted to the boundary region DA can send a signal to and receive a signal
back. Regions of spacetime causally connected to DĀ cannot be described by density
matrix ρA since we can have perturbations that do not affect ρA altering the spacetime
anywhere in this region (e.g. via the light wave denoted in red).

sions corresponding to bulk operators in this causal wedge. For a ball-shaped region
on the boundary of pure AdS, the causal wedge is precisely the Rindler wedge RB
discussed above.

An upper bound on the size of the region dual to ρA
We can place a useful upper bound on the size of the region encoded in ρA as fol-
lows. Consider a perturbation to the field theory state which takes the form |Ψi →
UĀ ⊗ 11A |Ψi. For the perturbed state, the density matrix ρA is the same as for the
unperturbed state, while the density matrix ρĀ is generally changed. As an example,
consider local perturbations contained within DĀ . These correspond to bulk pertur-
bations near the boundary of AdS which can propagate causally into the geometry, as
for the red signal coming from the left in figure 13. In general, the region of the bulk
affected by such perturbations is the union of the causal future and the causal past of
DĀ , J + (DĀ )∪J − (DĀ ). Since we can alter this region without altering ρA , we concluded
that the region dual to ρA must be contained in the complement of J + (DĀ )∪J − (DĀ ).18
     In the case of pure AdS and a region B on the boundary, the complement of
J + (DB̄ ) ∪ J − (DB̄ ) is again the Rindler wedge RB , so in this case, it seems that the
information contained in ρB corresponds precisely to bulk information about the physics
inside the Rindler wedge RB .
  18
    We can enlarge this by replacing DĀ with any bulk region that can be affected by changes in ρĀ
that do not affect ρA .


                                                31
   For a generic spacetime, the causal wedge of a region A is generally smaller than
the complement of J + (DĀ ) ∪ J − (DĀ ). Thus it is possible, and, as we will now see,
plausible, that the region dual to ρA is actually larger than the causal wedge.

The entanglement wedge
Another type of quantity that we can compute using the density matrix ρA is the set
of entanglement entropies for spatial regions contained within DA . According to the
RT/HRT formulas, these tell us about the areas of various extremal surfaces in the
bulk geometry. For larger boundary regions, the extremal surfaces generally penetrate
deeper into the bulk.19 The deepest such surface is the surface Ã that calculates the
entanglement entropy of the whole region A. For a generic asymptotically AdS space-
time, it turns out that this surface (and many other surfaces corresponding to large
subsystems in DA ) lies outside the causal wedge. Since the density matrix contains
information about the areas of all of these surfaces, it seems likely that the density
matrix ρA is dual to a larger region than just the causal wedge. Motivated by these
observations, it has been proposed [44, 17, 46] that the relevant region is the ENTAN-
GLEMENT WEDGE, defined to be the domain of dependence of any spatial bulk
region which has Ã as one boundary component and the remaining boundary compo-
nent some Cauchy surface in DA . There have been various arguments supporting the
validity of this claim.20
    One nice feature of the entanglement wedge proposal is that for a pure state of the
boundary theory, for which the regions A and Ā have the same surface Ã computing
their entanglement entropies, the entanglement wedges for these complementary regions
meet at the surface Ã. Thus, the spacetime naturally divides up into the two wedges
plus regions in the future and past of the wedges, as for the case of the maximally
extended black hole geometry. Note that the common information between the two
density matrices ρA and ρĀ is the spectrum of non-zero eigenvalues, which allows us
to compute the entanglement entropy common to the two density matrices. It is thus
natural that the common information between the two wedges is the surface Ã, whose
geometry allows us to compute the entanglement entropy holographically.21
    Note that for the case of pure AdS, the causal wedge and the entanglement wedge
coincide, but generically, the entanglement wedge is larger.22
  19
     In fact, assuming the bulk geometry satisfies the null energy condition, it has been proven that
the surface moves outward spatially as the size of the region is increased [17].
  20
     See [47] for a recent discussion.
  21
     It is interesting to ask what other covariant geometrical quantities associated to this surface
correspond to in the field theory.
  22
     This is implied by a theorem of Wald and Gao that light rays generically take longer to pass
through the bulk than to go along the boundary.




                                                 32
Summary
For a given spatial region A and its complement Ā, the information contained in the
state of a field theory on A ∪ Ā decomposes naturally as

                          |Ψi → ρA + ρĀ + entanglement info .                        (65)

We have seen that the two density matrices likely encode the physics in the entan-
glement wedges associated with A and Ā. In this case, the remaining region of the
spacetime, which lies within the light cone of the bulk surface Ã, should correspond
to the information about how the two field theory subsystems are entangled with one
another.
    To highlight this point, we can consider field theory states for which simple observ-
ables contained within the regions A and Ā are almost unchanged, but for which the
entanglement between the two subsystems is reduced. For example, considering the
vacuum state of the CFT on a sphere with ball-shaped regions B and B̄, we recall that
ρB and ρB̄ represent thermal ensembles with respect to the Hamiltonians HB and HB̄ .
Choosing typical pure states |EB i and |EB̄ i from these ensembles, we can consider the
product state |Ψ′ i = |EB i ⊗ |EB̄ i.23
    In this new state, almost any simple observable localized within B or B̄ should
have an expectation value that agrees with the expectation value in the state |Ψi; this
is the basic expectation of thermodynamics. In particular, the observables such as
response functions used to deduce the spacetime physics dual to ρB will give nearly the
same results as before, so we can say that interiors of the wedges dual to ρB and ρB̄
will be essentially unchanged. On the other hand, the entanglement between the two
subsystems in the new state has gone to zero. Taking the RT formula literally in this
case, we would conclude that the area of the minimal surface in the bulk spacetime
separating B and B̄ has gone to zero.24 This suggests some kind of singularity at
the boundary of the bulk wedges associated with B and B̄. Thus, in the state with
entanglement between B and B̄ removed, we expect that the dual spacetime still
includes two regions that are essentially the same as the AdS Rindler wedges RB and
RB̄ , but instead of joining smoothly to produce global AdS spacetime, we just have two
disconnected wedges each ending at some type of bulk singularity. These observations
are summarized in figure 14.
    These observations add weight to the suggestion that classical spacetime is con-
nected via entanglement in the CFT. Indeed, if we consider any point p in AdS and
any spacelike codimension-two plane Sp in the tangent space to that point, there will
be precisely one extremal surface through p tangent to Sp and ending on the boundary
of a ball-shaped region B on the AdS boundary. Removing the entanglement between
B and B̄ in the CFT as in the previous paragraph, we get two disconnected Rindler
wedges in the bulk (as in figure 14), each ending at the point p. Thus, the fact that the
 23
    To make this precise, we should consider a regulated version of the field theory.
 24
    Alternatively, it may be that the RT formula breaks down somehow, which presumably also
indicates a failure of classical geometry.

Aside: Black holes and firewalls
In 2012 and subsequently, there was a great deal of discussion following a paper [48]
of Almheiri, Marolf Polchinski, and Sully (AMPS) on the issue of whether black hole
horizons are smooth as is expected from classical general relativity, or whether some
quantum effects lead to singular behavior there.
     The argument in ([48]) very roughly goes as follows; see the paper for details. In
order to have smooth spacetime at a black hole horizon, we must have entanglement
between the quantum field theory modes inside and outside the horizon as in our dis-
cussion of Rindler space above. As a black hole evaporates, it becomes entangled with
its outgoing Hawking radiation. For a sufficiently old black hole, this entanglement
becomes maximal. The inside-the-horizon modes must then be entangled with some
radiation subsystem and therefore (due to basic “monogamy” constraints on entangle-
ment) cannot also have the entanglement with the outside-the-horizon modes required
to ensure a nonsingular space. Thus, the horizon of an old black hole must be singular
i.e. a firewall.
     Many arguments for and against firewalls appeared in the literature in the months
and years following the AMPS paper. Summarizing these would be beyond the scope
of the current notes; however, I’ll mention a couple of interesting connections to the
discussion in this section.


                                             34
    First, there is a possible way to avoid the firewall conclusion proposed by Maldacena
and Susskind [49] using some of the ideas discussed above. As we have discussed, in
the example of the maximally-extended AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, the spacetime
behind the horizon is encoded in the structure of entanglement between the two CFTs.
From the bulk point of view, we can interpret this entanglement as being between the
black holes in the two separate asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Thus, the existence of
smooth spacetime behind the horizon actually requires the entanglement of the black
hole with some other system. If something like this is also true in the AMPS example
of an evaporating black hole, it might be that the entanglement of the black hole with
its outgoing radiation does not forbid a smooth spacetime behind the horizon, but
rather is somehow the origin of it!25
    The best chance for a compelling argument for or against the firewall proposal is
within the context of a complete quantum theory of gravity. Thus, it is interesting to
ask whether black holes as described in the AdS/CFT correspondence have firewalls.26
The following argument [50] (see also [51] for a closely related argument) suggests that
either these black holes have firewalls, or that there is no state-independent observable
in the CFT that can be used to learn about the geometry behind the horizon.
    Consider a high-temperature canonical ensemble ρthermal of states in a holographic
CFT. Typical states in this ensemble correspond to large black hole microstates in
AdS. Outside their horizons, we expect that the geometry for each of these states is
well-approximated by the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. We would like to ask whether
the black holes corresponding to these microstates have smooth spacetime behind their
horizon. Suppose that 1) typical states have smooth spacetime behind their horizon and
2) there is some bounded CFT operator O that we can use to verify this (e.g. hOi = 1
if an observer on some particular trajectory encounters some smooth spacetime behind
the black hole horizon and less than one otherwise).
    In this case, we must have tr(ρthermal O) = 1: the expectation value in the canonical
ensemble should match with the expectation value in typical states since the canonical
ensemble is dominated by these states. The same result will hold for any purification
of ρthermal to some state of a larger system. Thus, we would conclude that the full
spacetime dual to any such purification would also have smooth spacetime behind the
horizon. This is certainly expected to be true for the thermofield double state, which
is dual to the maximally extended black hole geometry. However, it will not be true
for other purifications; for example, various states of the form UL ⊗ 11R |ΨiT F D will
correspond to perturbations to the maximally extended black hole geometry in which
a perturbation falling into the black hole on the left will be detected as a shockwave
  25
      We have argued that entanglement between fundemental degrees of freedom underlies the connec-
tivity of spacetime. Maldacena and Susskind’s suggestion in [49] is that not only is this entanglement
a necessary condition for connectedness, it is also sufficient. That is, they propose that any time two
subsystems are entangled (e.g. the black hole with its Hawking radiation), there is some geometrical
connection (they envision a “wormhole” connecting the black hole exterior with the radiation system).
This is known as the “ER=EPR” (Einstein-Rosen equals Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) proposal.
   26
      In the case of large AdS black holes, the black holes do not evaporate, but rather are in thermal
equilibrium with their Hawking radiation.



                                                  35
Figure 15: Two different purifications of a high-temperature thermal state ρR for a
CFT on S d . In the thermofield double, the geometry behind the black hole horizon on
the right is smooth, while in the perturbed state on the right, there will be a shockwave
behind the horizon. In either case, the density matrix ρR represents the ensemble of
single-sided black hole microstates. Thus, there cannot be a single operator

immediately behind the black hole horizon on the right, as shown in figure 15. Thus,
there will be states for which tr(ρthermal O) = 1 but the spacetime behind the black
hole horizon is not smooth, contradicting our assumptions.
    We conclude that either the typical black hole microstates do not all have smooth
spacetime behind their horizon, or the CFT operators used to probe behind-the-horizon
physics are state-dependent, i.e. there is no single operator O that we can use for all
CFT states to find out if there is smooth geometry.27 For more discussion on the issue
of state dependence, see [53] and references therein.


5      Spacetime physics from entanglement constraints
We have seen that the entanglement structure of CFT states is directly linked to the
geometrical structure of the dual spacetime. It is interesting to ask how much of space-
time dynamics, i.e. gravitation, can be understood from the physics of entanglement.
    It is not hard to see that geometries which capture the entanglement entropies
of CFTs states via the RT/HRT formulae must obey certain constraints. We have
already seen that entanglement entropies in general quantum systems are constrained,
for example by the subadditivity (43) and strong subadditivity (45) inequalities. For a
CFT on some spacetime B, these constraints govern which functions S(A) from subsets
of B to real numbers can represent the entanglement entropy of a consistent state.
    Starting from an arbitrary asymptotically AdS geometry M with boundary B, the
HRT formula also gives us a map S(A) from subsets of B to real numbers. In cases
where this map does not satisfy the restrictions arising from entanglement constraints,
we can conclude that the geometry M cannot correspond to a consistent CFT state in
  27
    Another possibility is the existence of “superselection sectors” [52], which is roughly the idea that
additional information beyond the CFT state is necessary to determine the dual spacetime.

ometries in region Gphys map into Sphys while the remaining geometries are unphysical
in any consistent theory for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds (plausibly equal
to the set of gravity theories with Einstein gravity coupled to matter in the classical
limit).

a theory for which the HRT formula is valid. If it is true that any UV complete theory
of Einstein gravity coupled to matter has a CFT dual in which the HRT formula holds,
then we must conclude that the spacetime M is unphysical.
    In this section, we first describe a variety of basic constraints on entanglement
structure, and then understand the implications of these constraints for geometries
dual to CFT states.

5.1    Entanglement constraints
In this subsection, we review a number of basic constraints on entanglement structure
in quantum mechanical theories. We discuss the constraints as they apply to general
quantum mechanical systems and then mention the specific results for conformal field
theories. In the next subsection, we will understand how these constraints applied to
holographic CFTs translate to gravitational constraints.

The first law of entanglement
We begin with a very useful result for the first order change in entanglement entropy
upon variation in the state.
   Consider a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i of a general quantum system with
subsystem A. Then from the definition (17) of entanglement entropy, the first order

                                          37
variation in the entanglement entropy for the subsystem A is given by28
                                                           
                       d                    d            d
                         SA = − tr log ρA ρA − tr          ρA                                  (66)
                      dλ                   dλ           dλ
Since the density matrix ρA for any state will have unit trace, the last term vanishes.
To simplify the expression further, we can define HA = − log ρA (λ = 0), usually known
as the MODULAR HAMILTONIAN associated with the unperturbed density matrix
ρA (λ = 0). With this definition, we can rewrite (66) as [54]
                               d       d          d
                                 SA =    hHA i ≡    tr(HA ρA ) .                               (67)
                              dλ      dλ         dλ
We emphasize that the modular Hamiltonian HA is defined in terms of the unperturbed
density matrix and is not a function of λ; thus, the derivative on the right side acts
only on the state ρA .
    The result (67) has become known as the FIRST LAW OF ENTANGLEMENT,
since it represents a quantum generalization of the first law of thermodynamics. To see
this, consider the special case where the unperturbed density matrix is thermal with
respect to some Hamiltonian H,
                                                1 −H/T
                                         ρA =     e    .                                       (68)
                                                Z
Then (67) gives
                                      d        1 d
                                        SA =        hHi ,                           (69)
                                     dλ        T dλ
or more simply, dE = T dS. This is the usual first law of thermodynamics, though in
the form (69), we are allowed to apply it to any perturbation of the state, not just
perturbations to some nearby equilibrium state.
    The entanglement first law (67) is most useful in cases where we have an explicit
expression for the modular Hamiltonian, as when the unperturbed density matrix is
thermal. For a conformal field theory on Minkowski space, a useful example is provided
by the case where the full state is the vacuum state and the subsystem is taken to be a
ball-shaped region. In this case, we can use our result (58),(60) for the density matrix
of the ball to rewrite (67) as [54]
                        d        π                          d

                          SB =          dd−1 x(R2 − |~x|2 ) hT00 (x)i .             (70)

Positivity and Monotonicity of Relative Entropy
The entanglement first law (67) has a natural generalization to finite perturbations. In
this case, the statement is an inequality, that

                                      ∆hHA i − ∆SA ≥ 0 .                                       (71)
  28
    Here, we should be worried about operator ordering in our manipulations, but using the cyclicity
property of the trace, it follows that d/dλ tr(f (ρ)) = tr(f ′ (ρ)dρ/dλ).

                                                38
To understand the origin of this constraint, we need to introduce a new quantum
information theoretic quantity, the RELATIVE ENTROPY of two states.
    Relative entropy is a measure of distinguishibility between a (mixed) state ρ and a
reference state σ associated with the same Hilbert space. It is defined as
                          S(ρ||σ) = tr(ρ log ρ) − tr(ρ log σ) .                    (72)
Relative entropy vanishes if and only if ρ = σ, and is otherwise a positive quantity.
Further, if A ⊂ B are two subsystems of a general quantum system, it follows that
                               S(ρA ||σA ) ≤ S(ρB ||σB ) .                         (73)
Roughly, this says that having access to a larger subsystem allows us to more easily
distinguish two states of the full system.
    In terms of the modular Hamiltonian Hσ = − log σ for the reference state, we can
rewrite (72) as
     S(ρ||σ) = [tr(ρ(− log σ)) − tr(σ(− log σ))] − [tr(−σ log σ) − tr(−ρ log ρ)]
             = ∆hHσ i − ∆S                                                       (74)
where ∆ indicates the difference between the values for the state ρ and the reference
state σ. Using this expression, positivity of relative entropy immediately gives the
finite generalization (71) of the entanglement first law. Further, monotonicity implies
that the difference on the right side of (74) is non-decreasing as we move to a larger
system size.
    For the case of a conformal field theory, we have an explicit expression for the
modular Hamiltonian when the reference state is taken to be the vacuum state and we
consider a ball-shaped region. In this case, we have the explicit constraints that
                        π
                          Z
                             dd−1 x(R2 − |~x|2 )hT00 (x)i − ∆SB ≥ 0.               (75)
                       R B
and that the left side increases as we deform B to any larger ball (or, more generally
to any ball whose domain of dependence contains the original ball). These generalize
the first law constraint (70) to finite perturbations.

Quantum Fisher Information
For a given reference state σ, the positivity of relative entropy is equivalent to the
statement that S(ρ||σ) has a global minimum at ρ = σ on the space of density matrices
ρA . Thus, the first order variation away from ρ = σ must vanish, while the second
order variation must be positive. The first order statement is
                                δhHσ i − δSA ≥ 0 = 0 ,                             (76)
which is exactly the first law of entanglement that we derived directly above. At second
order, we have
                                                            1 d2

                   ≡ hδρ, δρiσ .

To obtain the second line, we have used that
                                          2                   

           tr δρ log(σ + λδρ)          + tr σ 2 log(σ + λδρ)       =0,                  (77)
                 dλ              λ=0         dλ              λ=0


which follows by taking a λ derivative of tr(ρ(λ)∂λ log ρ(λ)) = tr(δρ) = 0.
   The quantity hδρ, δρiσ , a quadratic function of the first order perturbations, is
known as quantum Fisher information. It can be promoted to an inner product on the
tangent space to the manifold of states at σ via
                          1
           hδρ1 , δρ2 iσ ≡ (hδρ1 + δρ2 , δρ1 + δρ2 i − hδρ1 , δρ1 i − hδρ2 , δρ2 i) .   (78)
                          2
By the positivity of relative entropy, the quantum Fisher information metric is non-
degenerate, non-negative and can be thought of as defining a Riemannian metric on
the space of states.

A minimal set of strong subadditivity constraints
We have previously mentioned the constraints of subadditivity (43)

                                 S(A) + S(B) ≥ S(A ∪ B)                                 (79)

and strong subadditivity

                    S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C); ,                        (80)

where A, B, and C are disjoint subsystems of a quantum system. For a quantum
field theory on fixed spacetime B, we consider any Cauchy slice of B. Then the strong
subadditivity constraint must apply for the case where A, B, and C are any three
disjoint spatial regions of B.
    In our discussions below, it will be useful to note [22, 55] that the full set of strong
subadditivity constraints is implied by a smaller set, where B is taken to be arbitrary
while A and C are taken to be infinitesimal. To see this, consider regions A, B, C1
and C2 . Then the strong subadditivity constraints applied to triples {A, B, C1 } and
{A, B ∪ C1 C2 } give

               S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C1 ) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1 ) + S(B)
      S(A ∪ B ∪ C1 ) + S(B ∪ C1 ∪ C2 ) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1 ∪ C2 ) + S(B ∪ C1 ) .

Adding these, we find

           S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2 }) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2 }) + S(B) .

                                              40

                  Figure 17: Spacelike intervals for strong subadditivity.

Thus, if the strong subadditivity constraint applies for regions {A, B, C1} and regions
{A, B, C2 }, it applies for regions {A, B, C1 ∪ C2 }. Given general regions {A, B, C},
we can then divide up A and C into infinitesimal parts Ai , and Ci . Starting from
the strong subadditivity constraint for {A1 , B, C1 }, we can then use the results above
to keep appending infinitesimal parts Ai and Ci , eventually building up to the full
constraint for {A, B, C} = {∪Ai , B, ∪Ci }.

Two dimensions
As an example, consider the strong subadditivity constraints in the case of a field
theory in 1+1 dimensions.
     Let B be the interval [x1 , x2 ] while A and C are the intervals [x1 + ǫξ1 , x1 ] and
[x2 , x2 + δξ2 ], as shown in figure 17. In this case, the constraint (45) gives

          S([x1 + ǫξ1 , x1 ] ∪ [x1 , x2 ]) + S([x1 , x2 ] ∪ [x2 + δξ2 ])
                                             ≥ S([x1 + ǫξ1 , x1 ] ∪ [x1 , x2 ] ∪ [x2 + δξ2 ]) + S([x1 , x2 ])
=⇒        S(x1 + ǫξ1 , x2 ) + S(x1 , x2 + δξ2 ) − S(x1 + ǫξ1 , x2 + δξ2 ) − S(x1 , x2 ) ≥ 0

Expanding to first order in both δ and ǫ, this gives

                                          ξ1αξ2β ∂α1 ∂β2 S(x1 , x2 ) ≤ 0 .                         (81)

This second derivative of entanglement entropy has been dubbed the “entanglement
density” [22].
    Since the constraint (81) is linear in the spacelike vectors ξ1 and ξ2 , it is sufficient
to require that the constraint be satisfied in the lightlike limit of ξ1 and ξ2 , i.e. when ξ1
and ξ2 lie along the dotted lines in figure 17. For example, the constraint for a general
spacelike ξ1 is obtained as a linear combination of the constraints for ξ1 in the future
and past lightlike directions.
    Thus, a minimal set of strong subadditivity constraints that imply all constraints
for connected regions is
 1 2                        1 2                               1 2    1 2
∂+ ∂+ S(x1 , x2 ) ≤ 0      ∂+ ∂− S(x1 , x2 ) ≤ 0             ∂− ∂+ S(x1 , x2 ) ≤ 0
                                                                    ∂− ∂− S(x1 , x2 ) ≤ 0 .
                                                                                    (82)
The latter two constraints are saturated in the case of the vacuum state, so these are
likely to be more restrictive in general.

Aside: a one sentence proof of the c-theorem
As an aside, we note that the basic strong subadditivity constraints (82) lead immedi-
ately to a beautiful proof of the c-theorem in general two-dimensional CFTs. In fact,
we can write the proof, originally discovered by Casini and Huerta [56], using a single
sentence. There are many other interesting connections between entanglement and RG
flows; see for example [57, 58, 59].
Theorem: For any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory which flows from a
UV fixed point described by a CFT with central charge cU V to an IR fixed point de-
scribed by a CFT with central charge cIR , we must have cIR ≤ cU V .
Proof: Defining Svac (R) to be the vacuum entanglement entropy for an interval of
proper length R, and using
                                          q                        
                     S([x1 , x2 ]) = Svac              µ
                                             (x2 − x1 ) (x2 − x1 )µ                (83)

by Lorentz invariance, we find that the third or fourth strong subadditivity constraints
in (82) applied to an interval of proper length R gives
                                                      dS
                            c′ (R) ≤ 0            c(R) ≡ R ,                     (84)
                                                      dR
which proves the c-theorem, since in the limits of small and large R where the result
is governed by the UV and IR CFTs respectively, (32) shows that the monotonically
decreasing function c(R) reduces to cU V and cIR .

5.2     Gravitational interpretation of the constraints for holo-
        graphic CFTs
.
   We would now like to understand the gravitational interpretation of the various
constraints discussed above applied to subsystems of a holographic CFT.

5.2.1   The entanglement first law in holographic CFTs: deriving the Ein-
        stein Equations for small perturbations to AdS
First consider the entanglement first law (70), applied to a one parameter family of
states |Ψ(λ)i for which there are asymptotically AdS spacetimes M(λ) which compute
the spatial entanglement entropies for the states |Ψ(λ)i via the HRT formula. While
we have in mind that these states are part of some holographic CFT, we will be able to
derive the constraints on M without assuming anything but the validity of the HRT
formula.
    Since the vacuum state |Ψ(0)i corresponds to pure AdS spacetime, small pertur-
bations to this state should be represented by spacetimes that are close to pure AdS.
Using Fefferman-Graham coordinates (2) we can represent these by
                            ℓ2    2         µ     d              µ   ν
                    ds2 =
                                                                       
                               dz   + dxµ dx  + z   H µν (z, x)dx  dx              (85)
                            z2
                                             42
where H vanishes in the limit λ → 0. We would like to understand what the first law
(70) tells us about the perturbation H.

First law for infinitesimal balls
It is useful to first consider the case where the ball-shaped region is an infinitesimal
ball around some point x0 [60]. In this case, the right-hand side of (70) depends only
on the expectation value of the energy density at the point x0 . Using the HRT formula,
the left side will be determined by the area of the extremal bulk surface B̃ with the
same boundary as the infinitesimal ball. This surface is localized near the boundary of
AdS, so its area depends only on the asymptotic behaviour of the metric function H
in (85). A direct calculation shows that the first law translates to

                        dℓd−3 d i                   d
                                H i (x0 , z = 0) =    hT00 (x0 )i .                (86)
                       16πGN dλ                    dλ
Thus, the entanglement first law together with the HRT formula implies that the
asymptotic metric of M must be related to the CFT stress tensor expectation value.
This is a standard result in AdS/CFT, but we have seen that it follows directly from
the HRT formula.
    We can obtain a more covariant version of (86) by noting that we have worked so
far with balls in the t = 0 slice, i.e. in the frame of reference of an observer with
four-velocity uµ = (1, ~0). In term of this vector, we have found that

                 d µ ν           dℓd−3 d µ ν
                   u u hTµν i =          u u (Hµν − ηµν H α α ) |z=0 .             (87)
                dλ              16πGN dλ
But the same calculation goes through in any frame of reference, so the result (86)
must hold for any timelike u. This is possible if and only if

                      d           dℓd−3 d
                        hTµν i =          (Hµν − ηµν H α α ) |z=0 .                (88)
                     dλ          16πGN dλ
For any conformal field theory, translation invariance and scaling symmetry imply that
the stress tensor expectation value must be conserved and traceless,

                                ∂µ hT µν i = hT α α i = 0 .                        (89)

From (87), the dual geometry must then satisfy the constraints that

                              ∂µ H µν |z=0 = H α α |z=0 = 0 .                      (90)

These asymptotic constraints give our first restrictions on the geometry of a spacetime
dual to a CFT state. Taking these into account, we can simplify (87) to

                             d           dℓd−3 d
                               hTµν i =          Hµν |z=0 .                        (91)
                            dλ          16πGN dλ

                                            43
First law for general balls
Now consider the first law (70) applied to general balls [61, 60]. Using the result
(91) and the HRT formula, we can translate the first law constraint directly to a
gravitational constraint as
                 d            dℓd−3                       d
                                    Z
                   Area(B̃) =         dd−1 x(R2 − |~x|2 ) H00 (x, z = 0)       (92)
                dλ             4R B                      dλ
The left hand side can be written more explicitly starting from the area functional (26).
To calculate the variation in area, we can use the fact that the original surface extrem-
izes the area functional for the original metric. Thinking of the area as a functional
Area(G, X) depending on both the spacetime metric G and the embedding function
X, we can write the first order variation schematically as
                                     δArea         δArea δX
                            δArea =         δG +                δG .                  (93)
                                       δG           δX δG
However, the surface X being extremal means that the first variation of the area with
respect to variations in X vanishes, so only the first term here is nonzero, i.e. we need
only compute the variation of the action with respect to G while keeping the surface
X fixed.
    The basic relation det(M) = exp(tr(ln(M))) can be used to show that
                              dp            1p                d
                                  det gab =      det gab g cd gcd                     (94)
                             dλ             2                dλ
                                                                             i
where gab is the induced metric (27). Using  √ the spatial coordinates x to parameterize
the surface, and the explicit form Z(x) = R2 − ~x2 for the surface, we find for the ball
of radius R centered at the origin that
                     d               1                    d
                                       Z p
                       Area(B̃) =            det gab g cd gcd
                    dλ               2 B̃ Z              dλ
                                     ℓd−3             d
                                 =            dd−1 x (R2 Hii − xi xj Hij )            (95)
                                      2R B̃          dλ
Thus we have finally an explicit form of the constraint
                                             d
           Z                                   Z
                d−1    2        i j
               d x(R δHii − x x δHij ) =           dd−1 x(R2 − |~x|2 )δHii (x, z = 0) (96)
            B̃                               2  B
where δH represents the metric perturbation at first order in λ, and we have used the
tracelessness condition (90). Below, we will refer to the left and right sides of this
expression as δSBgrav and δEBgrav respectively.
    This result relates the metric perturbation in the interior of the geometry to asymp-
totic metric perturbation. It will only be satisfied for some special choices of H. We
actually have an infinite number of such constraints, one for each pair (xi0 , R) labeling
the center and radius of the ball. Associating each such constraint to a bulk point
(x = x0 , z = R) at the tip of the extremal surface, we note that there is one constraint
for each bulk point. This motivates the possibility that this infinite family of non-local
constraints is actually equivalent to a single local equation. We will now see that this
is the case.

                                           44
Converting the nonlocal constraints into a local equation
To obtain a local constraint on H from (96), the approach is similar to the steps used
to convert the integral form of Maxwell’s equations to the differential form. Essentially,
we use Stokes theorem. In detail, it turns out that for each choice of B, there exists a
differential form χB with the following three properties:29

    •                                            Z
                                                          χ = δEBgrav                                   (98)
                                                   B

    •                                             Z
                                                          χ = δSBgrav                                   (99)

In the last line, ξB0 , defined in (120) below is a positive function in the spatial region Σ
between B and B̃ (see figure 18), volΣ represents the volume form on this region, and
                                                                            

about AdS.
    With these properties, it is straightforward to convert the nonlocal constraints (96)
into a local equation. We have

This must be true for all possible half-ball regions Σ defined by {t = t0 , z < R2 − (~x − ~x0 )2 }.
It is not hard to show [60] that the vanishing of all of these integrals will hold if and
only if
                                       δE00 (x) = 0 .                               (103)
Thus, the entanglement first law constraints for ball-shaped regions in slices of constant
t implies the time-time component of the linearized bulk Einstein equations. To obtain
the remaining components, we first repeat the argument for ball-shaped regions in
general frames of reference. Using precisely the same reasoning that we used leading
up to (87), we obtain
                                      δEµν = 0 ,                                     (104)
where µ and ν correspond to the field theory directions. The remaining equations,

                                       δEzν = δEzz = 0                                 (105)

are constraint equations. They hold everywhere if they hold at z = 0, and it turns out
that at z = 0 they are precisely equivalent to the asymptotic constraints (90) that we
obtained by considering small balls.
    We have therefore shown that the first law of entanglement for ball-shaped regions
in the CFTs is precisely equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations in the gravity
dual theory [61, 60].

Connection to black hole thermodynamics
The equivalence of the entanglement first law with the linearized Einstein’s equations
is closely related to the the first law of black hole thermodynamics that served as

                                                46
one of the initial motivations for the connection between entropy and geometry. As
we described above, a Rindler wedge of pure AdS is equivalent to a Schwarzschild-
AdS black hole with non-compact hyperbolic horizon geometry, at a special value
of the temperature. While this spacetime bears little resemblance to our standard
notion of a black hole, it turns out that a general form of the first law of black hole
thermodynamics applies to this spacetime. The result, proved by Wald and Iyer [62] (we
review this below), says that for any perturbation satisfying the Einstein’s equations
linearized about this background (and more generally, any black hole background with
a “bifurcate Killing horizon”), the change in area of the horizon is equal to the change in
a certain energy defined based on the asymptotic metric. It turns out that this energy
is exactly the quantity δEBgrav coming in on the right hand side of (96). Thus, the black
hole first law is equivalent to the assertion that the linearized Einstein equation implies
the gravitational version of the entanglement first law. The result that the linearized
Einstein equation follows from the first law (applied to all boundary balls in all Lorentz
frames) thus provides a converse to the theorem of Wald and Iyer.

Generalizations
There are various generalizations of these first-order results. First, in higher-derivative
theories of gravity, it is known that the correct gravitational expressions for black hole
entropy (defined so that the laws of black hole thermodynamics work out correctly)
involve more general covariant functionals rather than area. It is possible to show that
starting with these more general functionals the entanglement first law implies the lin-
earized gravitational equations corresponding to the associated higher-derivative La-
grangian [60]. In this derivation, possible terms in the entanglement entropy functional
involving extrinsic curvatures do not contribute.
    We can also take into account the leading quantum effects in the gravitational the-
ory by including the quantum corrections (24) in the HRT formula. For a ball-shaped
region, the bulk entanglement term measures the entanglement of perturbative bulk
fields inside the associated Rindler wedge with fields outside the wedge. This entangle-
ment can be related directly to the expectation value of the bulk stress-energy tensor
via a bulk version of the entanglement first law (67). For this calculation, we require
the modular Hamiltonian for a Rindler wedge of AdS, for general quantum field theory
in its vacuum state. Fortunately, essentially the same path integral calculation (from
appendix C) that gives the density matrix for a Rindler wedge of Minkowski space also
works in AdS, yielding an expression analogous to (54) for the modular Hamiltonian.
Using that expression in the first law, we find that the extra bulk entanglement term in
the entanglement first law results in a source term for the linearized Einstein equations
[63]
                                   δEab = 8πGN hTab i .                               (106)
In this derivation, the universality of gravity, that all fields act as sources for gravita-
tion, arises from the universality of entanglement, that all fields contribute to the bulk

spatial entanglement entropy.30

What is the form χ?
For a deeper understanding of the relation between the entanglement first law and
the linearized Einstein equations, and to understand the meaning of the form χ that
played a crucial role in the derivation, it is helpful to review some formalism originally
introduced by Wald and collaborators (see e.g. [62, 64]). This formalism is also the
basis for the generalization to arbitrary covariant theories of gravity. This section is
not essential for understanding the remaining sections, so the reader should not worry
about fully absorbing the content here before continuing.
    Consider a general classical theory of gravity with covariant Lagrangian L(g), where
g represents the metric as well as any matter fields. For this theory, the action can be
written as the integral over spacetime of a differential form

                                                L = Lǫ                                         (107)

where
                                   √
                              ǫ=       gǫa1 ···ad+1 dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxad+1 .                    (108)
When we vary the action to determine the equations of motion for the theory, the usual
procedure is to make the variation and reorganize the result (via integration by parts)
as a total derivative plus a term proportional to the variation δg without derivatives on
δg. Requiring that this variation vanishes for any δg means that the term multiplying
δg must vanish. In terms of the differential form L, this means that we can write its
variation under a variation of the metric as

                                          δL = E · δg + dθ                                     (109)

where E represent quantities defined such that E = 0 are the equations of motion, and
· represents the various index contractions for the different fields (e.g. E ab δgab for the
term proportional to the metric variation). The term dθ is the exterior derivative of
a d-form θ; this is the total derivative term that we separate off when integrating by
parts.
    The quantity θ plays an important role in the phase space formulation of our grav-
itational theory. We recall that in general classical mechanics systems, dynamics can
be understood as evolution in phase space governed by Hamilton’s equations Ẋ = ξH
where ξH is a vector field on phase space defined in terms of a symplectic two-form W
and a Hamiltonian function H by

                                            ξH · W = dH .                                      (110)
  30
     Various authors have argued that the linearized gravitational equations plus the assumption that
the stress-energy tensor acts as a source for these equations requires that the complete theory is a
generally-covariant theory of gravity. With the additional assumption that the black hole entropy
functional is simply area (which follows from our assumption of HRT), the theory is further restricted
to Einstein gravity coupled to matter. Thus, we have at least an indirect argument for the full
non-linear gravitational equations starting from entanglement physics.

                                                   48
For our gravitational system, the symplectic form acts on a pair (δg1 δg2 ) of deforma-
tions to the metric, and is given by
                                              Z
                            W (g, δg1, δg2) =   ω(g, δg1, δg2 )                    (111)
                                                   Σ

where ω is defined in terms of θ as

                        ω(g, δg1, δg2 ) = δ1 θ(g, δg2) − δ2 θ(g, δg1) .               (112)

Now, consider the metric transformation g → g + LX g induced by a vector field X,
where (LX g)ab = ∇a Xb + ∇b Xa is the Lie derivative. This induces a flow on the
gravitational phase space. Using the definition (110), we can associate a phase space
Hamiltonian HX to this flow if for any other perturbation δg (viewed as second vector
field on phase space to which the one forms on the left and right side of (110) are
applied) we have
                                 δHX = W (δg, LX g) .                           (113)
As we will see below, certain very useful notions of energy in general relativity can be
defined in this way as the phase space Hamiltonian corresponding to specific vector
fields.
    The form θ also appears in the definition of conserved quantities associated with
symmetries of the gravitational theory. Since the theory is diffeomorphism invariant,
the coordinate transformation δx = X for any vector field X represents a symmetry
of the theory. By the usual Noether procedure, we can find an associated conserved
current, which turns out to be

                                  JX = θ(δX g) − X · L .                              (114)

This has been written as a differential form, so that the equation of current conservation
is simply
                                         dJX = 0 .                                   (115)
Because this holds for all vector fields X, it follows [62], that we can find a (d − 1)-form
Q such that
                                    JX = dQX + X a Ca                                  (116)
where Ca are quantities proportional to the equation of motion that vanish on shell.
   In terms of these definitions, the form χ used in the previous section is defined in
terms of X and an arbitrary variation of the fields as:

                             χ(g, δg) = δQX (g) − X · θ(δg)                           (117)

The key property of χ is that it obeys an identity

                       dχ = ω(g, δg, LX g) − X · (Eδg) − X a δCa .                    (118)



                                              49
In the case where the background metric g satisfies the equations of motion E = 0 and
admits a Killing vector X = ξ so that Lξ g = 0, this simplifies to

                                            dχ = −ξ a δCa .                          (119)

Recalling that Ca vanishes when the equations of motion are satisfied, we have that
δCa is a quantity that vanishes when the variation δg satisfies the equations of motion
linearized about the background g.
    This result leads directly to Iyer and Wald’s derivation of the first law of black hole
mechanics. In this case, we consider a black hole with a Killing horizon (i.e. a horizon
where some Killing vector in the black hole exterior vanishes), and take ξ to be the
Killing vector vanishing at the horizon. Then for any on-shell variation of the metric,
we haveR dχ = 0. R Integrating this from the spacetime boundary B to the horizon B̃,
we get B χ = B̃ δQξ . For Einstein gravity coupled to matter, it turns out that the
expression on the right is proportional to the variation in the area of the black hole
horizon, while the expression on the left has the interpretation of energy, and we get
the first law dE = T dS once we identify S = Area/4G. For more general theories
of gravity, everything still works, but Qξ is no longer the area. So we have this more
general quantity (usually called the Wald entropy functional) that describes the black
hole entropy.
    For our application to the previous section, we take g to be pure AdS, and ξ to be
a Killing vector (described below around equation (117)) that vanishes at the extremal
surface B̃. Then (119) is exactly the condition (100) that we needed above. As in
Wald’s derivation, the integral of χ over B̃ is the variation in the area of B̃ under
the metric perturbation, while the integral of χ over the boundary region B has an
interpretation as a variation in energy. These turn out to be exactly the conditions
(98) and (99) that we needed above.

5.2.2      Gravitational consequences of relative entropy inequalities
For ball-shaped regions in a holographic CFT, the expression for relative entropy (75)
can be translated directly to a gravitational quantity using the HRT formula and the
result (91) for the gravitational interpretation of the stress tensor expectation value.
The resulting quantity, which we denote as ∆E grav − ∆S grav , must be positive and
monotonic with increasing system size.31 We will now see that this quantity has the
interpretation as an energy associated to a bulk region that lies between the boundary
domain of dependence region DB and the extremal surface B̃.

Positivity of Fisher Information
We start by considering the interpretation of relative entropy for states that are small
perturbations to the vacuum. We recall that the leading contributions to relative
entropy come at second order and define the Fisher information (77).
 31
      The application of relative entropy in holography was initiated in [54].


                                                   50

boundary. Solid blue paths indicate the boundary flow associated with HB and the
conformal Killing vector ζ. Dashed red paths indicate the action of the Killing vector
ξ.

    On the gravity side, the positivity of Fisher information implies the positivity of
a certain perturbative gravitational energy [65]. To define this, consider the Rindler
wedge of the unperturbed AdS spacetime associated with the boundary ball B. Asso-
ciated to this is a bulk Killing vector ξB that vanishes on the Rindler horizon (i.e. the
extremal surface B̃ in the unperturbed spacetime) and asymptotes to the boundary
conformal Killing vector (59) near the AdS boundary, as shown in figure 19. Explicitly,
in the Rindler wedge associated with a ball of radius R situated at the origin on the
boundary Minkowski space, the Killing vector takes the form
                            2π                  π
                   ξB = −      t[z∂z + xi ∂i ] + [R2 − z 2 − t2 − ~x2 ] ∂t         (120)
                            R                   R
We can verify that this satisfies Lξ gAdS = 0, vanishes at ~x2 + z 2 = R2 and reduces to
(59) in the region DB at the boundary of AdS. For the quantum field theory describing
perturbative bulk fields on the pure AdS background, this timelike Killing vector defines
to a symmetry, so there is an associated conserved energy, which includes contributions
from all fields including the metric perturbation. This takes the form
                                 Z
                                                    grav b

where Σ is a Cauchy surface for the Rindler wedge, and the gravitational stress tensor
is defined (up to a boundary term) as the expression quadratic in the first order metric

perturbation that acts as a source for the second order metric perturbation in the
perturbative Einstein equations.32 This quantity is known as the canonical energy
associated with the Killing vector ξB . Thus, Fisher information in the CFT is dual
to canonical energy on the gravity side, and the relative entropy inequalities imply
that this energy must be positive for the Rindler wedges associated with all possible
boundary balls and must increase as we increase the size of the ball.

Relative entropy constraints for general asymptotically AdS geometries
The fact that relative entropy corresponds to a natural gravitational energy at second
order in perturbations to pure AdS suggests that this quantity might be related to some
notion of energy more generally. This is very interesting, as it is a notoriously difficult
problem to come up with precise covariantly defined notions of energy for gravitational
subsystems.
    For a general asymptotically AdS spacetime, there will be no Killing vectors, and
no preferred definition of time apart from the boundary time used to define the ADM
mass of the whole spacetime. It is therefore unclear a priori how to define useful
notions of energy for subsystems. However, the following definition turns out to be
the precise dual of relative entropy associated with a ball-shaped region B [66]. In
place of the Killing vector (120) defined for a Rindler wedge of AdS, we define a vector
ξ in the entanglement wedge associated with B that has the same behavior as the
Rindler wedge Killing vector near the extremal surface and near the AdS boundary.
Specifically, we demand that ξ reduces to the conformal Killing vector ζB at the AdS
boundary region DB , that ξ vanishes at the extremal surface B̃, and that the Killing
equation (Lξ g)ab = ∇(a ξb) = 0 is satisfied at the boundary (up to some order in z)
and at the extremal surface. We also require that the antisymmetrized derivative at
the extremal surface has the same behavior as for the Rindler wedge Killing vector.
It is always possible to satisfy these conditions, and in fact there is a great deal of
freedom in choosing ξ since it is essentially unconstrained away from the boundaries
of the entanglement wedge.
    Though our general asymptotically AdS spacetime M has no Killing vectors, the
vector ξ generates a diffeomorphism, and this is a symmetry of the gravitational theory.
  32
     To derive this result, we can use the results (98) and (99) that δS grav and δE grav are related to
the integral of the form χ over B̃ and B respectively. Assuming the background and perturbations
satisfy the equations of motion, we can then use the identity (118) to obtain

                                d                              d

which can be shown to hold at any point on a one-parameter family of solutions. Taking another
derivative and setting λ = 0 so that g = gAdS , we get

                          d2                                      d       d

                         dλ                                      dλ      dλ

The expression on the right is defined by Hollands and Wald [64] to be the canonical energy associated
with ξ, and shown to be equivalent to (121).


                                                  52
Thus, we can define an associated symmetry current (the quantity Jξ defined in (116))
and integrate over a spatial slice of the entanglement wedge to define the corresponding
charge EB . Remarkably, this charge is independent of the choice of ξ, and it is exactly
the quantity dual to relative entropy. Thus, if the spacetime M does correspond to
some consistent CFT state, the energy EB associated with the entanglement wedge
of B must be positive for every choice of B and be larger for a larger ball B ′ with
DB ⊂ D B ′ .
   This result can be understood as a prediction for a new positive energy theorem
in general relativity. We have derived it making use of basic quantum mechanical
constraints in the underlying CFT description for the theory. However, it is plausible
that assuming some standard energy condition in GR would be sufficient to derive the
result directly as a theorem in classical general relativity.

Example: spherically symmetric geometries
As a simple example, we can consider the constraints on regular spherically-symmetric
asymptotically AdS geometries in four dimensional gravity, for example, the geometry
associated with a spherically symmetric distribution of matter obeying some equation
of state. If this solution represents a consistent state in a UV-complete theory of
gravity, it should correspond to a homogeneous state of some CFT on a sphere. For
this state, the relative entropy to the vacuum state for any ball-shaped region must
be positive. Taking the region to be a hemisphere, and using the expression (170) for
the modular Hamiltonian of a ball in the vacuum state on a sphere, the positivity of
relative entropy (71) yields [55]
                                     ∆A ≤ 2πGN Mℓ .                                     (124)
where the left side represents the area of the surface bisecting the spherically-symmetric
space relative to this area in pure AdS,33 and M is the mass of the spacetime. The
right side is obtained from the modular Hamiltonian expectation value using the fact
that for a translation-invariant stress-tensor on the sphere (which we assume to be of
unit radius), we have
                                             ECF T     Mℓ
                                 ∆hT00 i =          =      .                         (125)
                                               4π       4π
    The result (124) tells us that there is a limit to how much a certain mass can deform
the spacetime from pure AdS. This should restrict the equation of state that matter in
a consistent theory of gravity can have. It would be interesting to understand whether
this constraint also follows from one of the more standard energy conditions typically
assumed in general relativity.

5.2.3   Strong Subadditivity
We can also investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions on a dual spacetime M
for the strong subadditivity constraints to be satisfied. According to Wall [17], the
  33
    This surface will be extremal by symmetry. We are assuming it is the minimal-area extremal
surface; if not, the results we derive apply to the minimal area extremal surface instead.

                                             53
null energy condition is a sufficient condition, but the necessary conditions for strong
subadditivity may be weaker, and it is interesting to understand precisely what strong
subadditivity tells us about the dual spacetime.
    So far, there are some limited results [55, 22] for the gravitational interpretation of
the constraints (82) in the case of two dimensional CFTs. For a geometry MΨ dual
to some holographic CFT state, the constraints are that (82) hold, where S(x1 , x2 ) is
replaced by the area of the minimal-length geodesic with endpoints x1 and x2 on the
boundary of AdS. In [55, 22], it was found that for geometries dual to the vacuum
states of Lorentz invariant field theories corresponding to RG-flows between UV and IR
CFTs, and also for non-vacuum states of a CFT corresponding to small perturbations
to AdS, the strong-subadditivity constraints are exactly equivalent to the conditions
                                      Z
                                         Gµν k µ k ν ≥ 0                              (126)
                                      B̃

where k is a null vector field defined along B̃ and normalized so that the spatial scale
factor in the geometry changes by the same rate at all points on the curve when we
translate by k. This represents a version of the null energy condition averaged over
a spatial geodesic. Extending these results to more general geometries and to higher
dimensions is an interesting open question.


6     Which theories and which states are holographic?
In the previous section, we considered constraints on spacetimes dual to states of
holographic conformal field theories. We assumed that for these states (which we will
call holographic), the entanglement entropies of spatial regions are all encoded in a
single geometry M via the holographic entanglement entropy formula. This represents
a very special structure of entanglement: the space of possible entanglement entropies
(functions on a space of subsets of the AdS boundary) is much larger than the space
of possible asymptotically AdS metrics (functions of a few spacetime coordinates), so
only a tiny fraction of all quantum field theory states should be geometric in this way.
    For a general conformal field theory, there is no reason to expect any of the states
to have their entanglement represented geometrically. Even for holographic conformal
field theories, not all states will have this property: taking a quantum superposition of
a small number of states corresponding to different classical geometries, the resulting
state will correspond to a quantum superposition of geometries rather than a single
classical geometry. Thus, it is an interesting question to understand better which the-
ories have these holographic states and which states of these theories are holographic.
    In this section, we will mention a few of the special properties characterizing holo-
graphic states and holographic theories, specifically those related to entanglement
structure.




                                            54
A necessary condition for CFTs with Einstein gravity duals from entangle-
ment
For the vacuum state of any conformal field theory, the vacuum entanglement entropies
for ball-shaped regions are given by a universal formula (e.g. equation (32) for the
two-dimensional case) that matches with the areas of extremal surfaces in pure Anti
de Sitter spacetime. However, taking any more general region A, the CFT vacuum
entanglement entropy for this region would not be expected to match with the gravity
result for the area of the extremal surface Ã in AdS. Requiring this agreement gives
a necessary condition for a CFT to have a holographic dual whose classical limit is
Einstein gravity coupled to matter (i.e. for which the entanglement functional is simply
area). Since this condition must hold for all possible regions Ã, it should be quite
constraining; perhaps it is even a sufficient condition for a CFT to have an Einstein
gravity dual.
    One way to investigate this constraint in more detail is to start with the case of a
ball-shaped region and work perturbatively in deformations to the shape of the region.
For recent calculations along these lines, see [25].

Entanglement entropy from one-point functions in holographic states
Now consider a theory which has a holographic dual theory with some particular bulk
equations of motion in the classical limit. Any classical spacetime MΨ dual to a holo-
graphic state |Ψi must be a solution to the bulk equations of motion. We can think of
the bulk equations as determining a solution everywhere starting from some initial data
on a Cauchy surface. In AdS, it is convenient to think instead of the bulk solution as
being determined by evolution in the holographic radial direction, with “initial data”
specified at the timelike boundary of AdS.34 Thus, for geometries dual to holographic
states, we can say that the bulk spacetime (at least in a perturbative sense) is encoded
in the boundary behavior of the various fields.
    The boundary behavior of the light bulk fields is determined according to AdS/CFT
by the one-point functions of some associated low-dimension local operators in the CFT.
For example, we have seen that the boundary behavior of the metric is determined
by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor as in (91). Once we have the
bulk spacetime solution, we can use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate many
other non-local quantities in the CFT such as correlation functions and entanglement
entropies. Thus, the assumption that a state is holographic allows us (via gravity
calculations) to determine the entanglement entropies and other non-local properties
of the state from the local data provided by the one-point functions:

  |Ψi → hOα (xµ )i → φα asymptotics → φα (xµ , z) → entanglement entropies S(A)
                                                                             (127)
where φ here indicates all light fields including the metric.
  34
    Here, the existence and uniqueness of solutions is less clear, but we can at least construct solutions
perturbatively away from the boundary.



                                                   55
Figure 20: The interior region I in a slice of AdS is contained in the entanglement
wedge for any CFT subsystem larger than Ā, but no CFT subsystem smaller than A.

    The recipe (127) could be applied to any state, but for states that are not holo-
graphic, the results will be inconsistent with the actual CFT answers. For example,
using this recipe, the vacuum one-point functions for any CFT will give us pure AdS
spacetime, and we have seen in the previous subsection that entanglement entropies for
more general regions will generally not match with those calculated by the holographic
formula from this spacetime.
    Thus, we have a stringent (in-principle) test for whether a CFT state has a dual
description well-described by a classical spacetime: carry out the procedure in (127)
and compare the results with a direct CFT calculation of the entanglement entropies;
if there is a mismatch for any region, the state is not holographic.

Quantum error correction
An interesting feature of holographic states is that they share some features with states
referred to by quantum information theorists as “quantum error-correcting codes” [67].
The basic feature of these states is that they encode some specific information non-
locally, in such a way that the information can be recovered if we have access to any
sufficiently large subsystem. Thus, even if a (sufficiently small) part of the our system
is corrupted somehow, we can still recover the encoded information by looking at a
complementary subsystem.
    To understand the connection with the AdS/CFT correspondence, recall that the
density matrix ρA for a spatial subsystem A of the CFT encodes information about
the entanglement wedge (call this WA ) in the bulk, as we discussed in section 4. Now,
consider some ball I in the interior of AdS, as shown in figure 20. According to the
duality between density matrices and bulk entanglement wedges, we can say that

   • The information about I is contained in the density matrix for any region larger
     than Ā, since the region I will be contained in the corresponding entanglement


                                           56
     wedge.

   • The information about I is not contained in the density matrix for any region
     smaller than A, since none of the corresponding entanglement wedges intersect
     I

Thus, we have a behavior similar to a quantum error-correcting code; the information
about the central region is “protected” from corruption of small subsystems. The latter
property shows that this protection is not achieved by simply storing the information
many times in different spatial subsystems (as in classical error-correction), but rather
by distributing it nonlocally throughout the system.
    An interesting consequence of this picture is that for a bulk observable localized
in the region I, there cannot just be a single CFT operator corresponding to this
observable, since no nontrivial CFT operators are common to all subsystems larger than
Ā (alternatively, there are no operators that commute with all operators in subsystems
smaller than A). Instead, there must be a family of CFT operators corresponding to
this observable, such that each CFT subsystem larger than Ā contains one of these
operators. Since the operators in this family are different, they cannot have the same
expectation values for all states of the CFT, but it is possible that they agree on some
subset (or subspace) of the states for which we have nice classical dual geometry. In
the language of quantum error correction, this is the “code subspace.”
    In summary, one of the special features of holographic states that distinguish them
from general CFT states is that they have features reminiscent of quantum error-
correcting codes. For a more detailed discussion, see [67, 68].

Entropy inequalities for holographic states
In the previous section, we have discussed constraints on entanglement entropies that
must hold in all multipartite quantum systems. We have seen that for holographic CFT
states, some of these constraints can be related to properties of the dual geometries. For
example, in static geometries, strong subadditivity inequalities can be shown to hold
automatically from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [29]. It turns out that by assuming the
existence of a dual geometry for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds, it is possible
to prove additional constraints on entanglement entropies that are not generally true
in all quantum systems. As an example, it can be shown [69] that for any state dual
to a static asymptotically AdS geometry, we have

 S(A ∪ B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ B) − S(B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ C) + S(A) + S(B) + S(C) ≤ 0 , (128)

known as the negativity of tripartite information. Unlike subadditivity and strong sub-
additivity, this inequality is not generally true in quantum systems. Thus, it represents
a necessary condition for a CFT state to be holographic (at least in the state case). A
more general family of such constraints has been discussed in [70].

7    Conclusion
There are many interesting topics that I have not been able to mention here, due to
limitations of time and my own expertise; this is certainly not meant to be a com-
prehensive review of the subject. The reader is encouraged to look at some of the
references, and also to see which recent papers cite some of the key references in order
to get a sense of what is going on currently. Also recommended are various online
lectures, for example those from the “It From Qubit” summer school at Perimeter In-
stitute, and from various recent conferences on gravity and entanglement at KITP and
the Perimeter Institute. To conclude, I will briefly mention of a few more interesting
topics that may be useful to be aware of.

Dynamics of entanglement
It is interesting to understand how entanglement evolves in time-dependent states. For
example, we can consider either a “global quench” in which the Hamiltonian of a sys-
tem suddenly undergoes a translation-invariant perturbation, or a “local quench” for
which the perturbation is localized to some finite region. In either case, the state of
the system will evolve with time after the quench, and we can ask about the time-
dependence of the entanglement entropy for regions of a certain size (and, in the case
of the local quench, location). Many authors have considered this problem in quantum
field theories and in holography; understanding the behavior in holographic theories
implied by gravitational physics gives us further constraints on the properties of holo-
graphic CFTs and holographic states. For some recent work on this subject, including
interesting connections to quantum chaos, see for example [71, 72, 73, 74] and references
therein.

Kinematic space
In section 5.2, we saw that the linearized Einstein equations in the bulk could be un-
derstood in the CFT language as saying that the entanglement first law is satisfied for
all ball-shaped regions in all Lorentz frames. This space of regions, or alternatively
the space of domain of dependence regions DB for all balls B, has been called “kine-
matic space”; in recent work [75, 76, 77], there have been hints that various aspects of
CFT physics and of AdS/CFT might be understood naturally using the language of
kinematic space.
    We can define a natural set of coordinates on kinematic space by noting that the
domain of dependence DB of each ball-shaped region is bounded by the future light
cone of some point x0 and the past lightcone of some point x1 in the future of x0 .
Thus, we can associate points in kinematic space with pairs of points X = (x0 , x1 ) on
the original spacetime with x1 in the future of x0 ; this is some 2d-dimensional space.
There is a conformally-invariant signature (d, d) metric on this space [76, 77], and also
a natural partial ordering: we say X1 < X2 if DX1 ⊂ DX2 .
    All regions DX are conformally equivalent. We can define a mapping from each
DX to some standard region D0 (e.g. the domain of dependence of a unit sphere

                                           58
in Minkowski space, or hyperbolic space times time). Then, given any state |Ψi of
the CFT, the density matrix ρDX maps to some density matrix ρ0 for our standard
region D0 . Thus, for every state of the CFT, we can associate a function ρ0 (X)
from kinematic space to the space of density matrices for the CFT on D0 . Starting
from this construction, we can we define other natural functions on kinematic space,
for example, the vacuum subtracted entanglement entropy ∆S(X). For states close
to the vacuum, this has been shown to satisfy some simple differential equation on
kinematic space [76, 77]. We can also consider the relative entropy to some reference
state, R(X)| Ψ0 i. Monotonicity of relative entropy implies that any such function
obeys R(X)| Ψ0 i > R(Y )| Ψ0 i for X > Y ; i.e. these relative entropy functions are
all monotonic on kinematic space with respect to the natural partial ordering.
    It will be interesting to see whether additional new insights about CFTs and holog-
raphy will be gained by thinking about these kinematic space structures.

Tensor Networks
Holographic CFTs are strongly coupled theories with a large number of degrees of
freedom. Thus, it is difficult to understand their quantum states directly; most of
what we know about these states is based on calculations in the dual gravitational
theory. It is interesting to ask whether we can find examples of states in simpler
quantum systems which share qualitative features with the holographic CFT states.
At the very least, constructing such states is a useful way of demonstrating that certain
features deduced from the gravity side (e.g. a particular structure of entanglement)
are even possible in a consistent quantum system.
    Recently, starting with the work of Swingle [40], it has been understood that certain
states associated with “tensor networks” share many features with states of holographic
CFTs; thus studying the physics in the tensor network states may give us new insights
into holography.
    To define tensor network states, consider a quantum system with Hilbert space

                              H = Hd ⊗ Hd ⊗ Hd · · · ⊗ Hd                           (129)

where we typically imagine that the dimension-d tensor product factors correspond
to subsystems arranged spatially, as in a spin chain. Given a set of basis elements
|i1 i ⊗ |i2 i ⊗ · · · , a general state of the system can be written as
                                      X
                               |Ψi =      ψi1 i2 ...iN |i1 i ⊗ |i2 i ⊗ · · · |iN i . (130)
                                 i

Thus, any state of the system corresponds to some tensor ψi1 i2 ...iN .
   One is often interested in finding the ground state of a system for some particular
choice of Hamiltonian, e.g. a local Hamilton that includes interactions between tensor
product factors corresponding to nearby subsystems. It turns out that in many such
cases, we can come up with a very good approximation to the ground state by building



                                           59
the tensor ψi1 i2 ...iN out of simpler tensors. For example, consider a general three-index
tensor MiA B , which could be used to describe a map

                                         M : HD → HD ⊗ Hd                                               (131)

as                                            X
                                    M=                MiA B |ii ⊗ |AihB| .                              (132)
                                              i,A,B

From this tensor M, we can define a state of our original system (known as a matrix
product state) as
                                  X
                   ψi1 i2 ...iN =   Mi1 A1 A2 Mi2 A2 A3 · · · MiN AN A1 .     (133)
                                         Ai

This construction can be represented diagrammatically as in figure 21a.35 . The ex-
pression (133) can be thought of as a variational ansatz used to approximate the true
ground state. If the dimension D of the auxiliary space is not too large, the number of
parameters defining the state (133) is far smaller than the number of parameters defin-
ing a general state of the system, so solving the variational problem is computationally
much less demanding that finding the exact ground state. For systems with long-range
correlations (e.g. those which approximate continuum conformal field theories), simple
tensor network states (133) generally do not provide a good approximation to the true
ground state but we can consider states associated with more complicated networks
such as the one shown in figure 21b. One might hope that certain tensor network states
of this type, which provide good approximations to CFT ground states, could provide
a useful toy model for holographic states. Specifically, we might hope that such states
have a structure of entanglement similar to that in holographic theories, as suggested
originally by [40].
    In recent work [68, 78], tensor network states have been constructed for which
the entanglement structure is “geometric” just as in holographic theories. These
states obey a Ryu-Takayanagi formula where the entropy of a subsystem A is well-
approximated by the “area” of a minimal surface in the network, defined to be the
minimal number of network links that need to be cut in order to isolate A from the
rest of the system. This is illustrated in figure 21b. In particular, [78] has shown that
this feature is generically true if the dimensions associated to legs in the network are
large and the tensors are chosen randomly. Thus, if we choose a network for which the
graph minimal “areas” behave in the same way as the minimal surface areas in AdS or
some other geometry (e.g. by choosing the graph to be a discretization of the given ge-
ometry), we obtain states whose entanglement structure is very similar to holographic
CFT states. In the models of ([68]), the network states have also been shown to have
  35
    To be more precise, we could draw arrows on the edges of the graph such that an outgoing arrow
represents a lower index and an incoming arrow represents an upper index. Alternatively, we can
take all the vertices to represent tensors with lower indices (i.e. states) and edges to represent index
contractions with some choice of tensor M ij , giving T···i···

              ij                ij    ij

A     Metrics
In this section, we collect various representations of vacuum Anti de Sitter space and
asymptotically Anti de Sitter black hole geometries that will be useful in our discus-
sions.
    To describe Anti-de-Sitter space AdSd+1 , we can start by considering the (d + 1)-
dimensional hyperboloid
                            2
                         − X−1 − X02 + X12 + · · · + Xd2 = −ℓ2                   (134)



                                          61
of (d + 2)-dimensional space with metric

                       ds2 = −dX−1
                                2
                                   − dX02 + dX12 + · · · + dXd2 .                     (135)

The resulting spacetime has signature (d, 1) but has closed timelike curves correspond-
ing to orbits of the rotation symmetry in the (X−1 , X0 ) plane. We can consider instead
the universal cover of this space, obtained by letting the angular coordinate associated
with this symmetry have a range (−∞, ∞) instead of [0, 2π). The resulting spacetime
is pure global Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, or “global AdS”, a homogeneous and isotropic
Lorentzian spacetime. For certain calculations, it is useful to work directly with these
embedding space coordinates, taking into account the constraint (134).
    We can alternatively represent global AdS via the metric

                     ds2 = ℓ2 (− sinh2 ρdt2 + cosh2 ρdρ2 + ρ2 dΩ2d−1 )                (136)

which arises by parameterizing the surface by

                                   X0 = ℓ cosh ρ cos τ
                                  X−1 = ℓ cosh ρ sin τ
                                   Xi = R sinh ρΩi .                                  (137)

Here, Ωi are combinations of the angular coordinates on S d−1 whose squares sum to
one (e.g. (cos θ, sin θ cos φ, sin θ sin φ) for S 2 .
    Here, the spatial metric in (136) describes d-dimensional hyperbolic space, the
homogeneous and isotropic space with negative curvature. Note that the metric of
AdS is not simply hyperbolic space times time, but rather a “warped product,” in
which the time dilation factor relating coordinate time to proper time varies with
space.
    Starting from any point in AdS, there is an infinite proper distance to ρ = ∞.
However, a light signal can reach ρ = ∞ and return in finite proper time. Thus, there
is a sense in which Anti de Sitter space has a boundary at ρ = ∞ that can be probed
by light signals. To highlight this causal structure, it is useful to define yet another set
of coordinates,via
                                          tan θ = sinh ρ .                            (138)
With this definition, the metric becomes

                           2    ℓ2
                         ds =    2
                                    (−dτ 2 + dθ2 + sin2 θdΩ2 ) ,                      (139)
                              cos θ
so that the boundary is at θ = π/2. Apart from the overall factor which has no effect on
light-ray trajectories, the geometry is that of a Euclidean ball times time. Trajectories
of light rays are the same in this space as in AdS, so this description is very useful
in understanding the causal structure. For this reason, AdS is often depicted as a

middle and points closer to the boundary, it is an infinite volume spacetime in which
all points are equivalent.
    The overall factor in front of the metric (139) diverges at the boundary, so while
the boundary has a well-defined causal structure, it does not a priori have a particular
geometry associated with it. However, sometimes it is convenient to make a choice of
boundary geometry consistent with this causal structure. In practice, a simple way to
do this is to define a coordinate z which vanishes at the boundary, such that the metric
near the boundary of AdS takes the form

                                   ℓ2

                                   z2
where Γµν (z, x) has a finite limit Γ0µν (x) as z → 0. This choice is known as a Fefferman-
Graham system of coordinates. In this representation, surfaces of constant z then have
a particular geometry induced by the metric in AdS. If we rescale the metric for these
surfaces by z 2 in the limit z → 0, we obtain a well-defined geometry in the limit,
described by the metric Γ0µν (x). We will refer to this as the boundary geometry. We
emphasize that this boundary geometry is artificial and represents a choice among the
class of geometries with the same causal structure. Such geometries are related by a
conformal transformation (i.e. an overall spacetime-dependent rescaling of the metric).
No experiment in AdS can be performed to determine which geometry in this class is
the boundary geometry.
    For pure AdS spacetime, the Fefferman-Graham representation of the metric with
boundary geometry chosen to be S d × R is

This is a convenient representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a
conformal field theory defined on a sphere times time.
   We can also choose a Fefferman-Graham description with Minkowksi space bound-
ary geometry, in which the metric takes the particularly simple form

                                            ℓ2

These coordinates cover only a portion of AdS, the shaded region in figure 22 known
as the “Poincaré patch”. The coordinates in (143) are related to the global AdS
coordinates in (136) by

       z                1                        t                        xi

where Ωi = sin θ1 cos θ2 , ..., sin θ1 sin θ2 · · · sin θd−1 such that cos2 θ1 + Ω2i = 1. This is a
very useful representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a holographic
conformal field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime.

Asymptotically locally AdS geometries
In the AdS/CFT correspondence, general holographic states of a CFT on a bound-
ary spacetime B correspond to spacetimes which are asymptotically locally AdS, with
boundary geometry B. These may generally be represented in Fefferman-Graham co-
ordinates (140), where Γ(z = 0) is taken to be the metric of B. Spacetimes associated
with different states are associated with different behavior for Γ away from z = 0.
   Some important examples are the black hole geometries in AdSd+1 , corresponding to
the CFT in a thermal state. For global AdS, the corresponding black hole is spherically
symmetric and can be described by

                                                       dr 2

These can also be described in Fefferman-Graham coordinates; for example the metric
of a 2+1 dimensional planar-AdS black hole (known as a BTZ black hole) can be
rewritten as
                         ℓ2
                  ds2 = 2 (dz 2 − (1 − µz 2 /2)2 dt2 + (1 + µz 2 /2)2 dx2 ) .     (150)
                         z
This solution (for the special case of 2+1 dimensions) is locally the same as pure AdS
(as are all solutions to Einstein’s equations in three dimensions without matter). By
a coordinate transformation, this geometry can be mapped onto the region in the
geometry (143) which is the intersection of the causal past and the causal future of
a diamond-shaped region which is the domain of dependence of the interval {x ∈
[−1, 1], t = 0} on the boundary.


B       Conformal transformations on density matrices
In this appendix, we briefly review a few relevant facts about conformal symmetries in
field theory. We say that two spacetimes M and M̃ with metrics g(x), g̃(x̃) are related
by a conformal transformation if there is a map

                                   xµ → x̃µ = f µ (x)                             (151)

between points of the two spacetimes such that the metrics are related as

                         gµν (x̃)dx̃µ dx̃ν = Ω2 (x)gµν (x)dxµ dxν                 (152)

where the overall spacetime-dependent scaling Ω(x) is known as the conformal factor.
Conformal field theories on two spacetimes related by such a conformal transformation
are equivalent, and there is a one-to-one mapping between the states of the two theories
that we can write as
                                     ρM = UΩ ρM̃ UΩ† .                            (153)
    In the special case where the two spacetimes are equivalent to one another (e.g.
where they are both Rd,1 and the transformation represents a translation, boost, scal-
ing, inversion or some combination of these), this transformation defines a map on the
space of states of a single theory. The vacuum state of a CFT on Rd,1 or S d × R is
invariant under these transformations, which represent the spacetime symmetries of
the CFT.


                                             65
Examples
There are several specific examples of conformal transformation that will be useful to
us in the context of AdS/CFT. First, we can show that Minkowski space is conformally
equivalent to a part of S d × R, namely the domain of dependence of a sphere minus
a single point p, as shown in figure 12.36 Through this transformation, any state of
the CFT on the sphere can be associated with a Minkowski space CFT state for each
such domain of dependence region. The vacuum state of the sphere CFT maps to the
vacuum state of the CFT on Minkowski space.
    Through this transformation, the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region on
the sphere maps to the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski
space. By a further conformal transformation mapping Minkowski space to itself, this
domain of dependence region can be mapped to the domain of dependence of a half
space (for example x1 > 0). This region is also conformally equivalent to the static
spacetime H d × R, where H d is hyperbolic space, the non-compact Euclidean manifold
of constant negative curvature.


C        Path integral representation of states and den-
         sity matrices in quantum field theory
Path integrals are a familiar tool in quantum field theory to represent various useful
quantities such as the partition function or the generating functional for correlation
functions. They can also be used to represent various states and density matrices.
We begin with the basic result that transition amplitudes can be expressed as a path
integral as
                                                   Z φ(t1 )=φ1
                               −iHt
                    hφ1 (t1 )|e     |φ0 (t0 )i = N             [dφ]eiS(φ(t)) ,   (154)
                                                          φ(t0 )=φ0

where N is a normalization factor. The derivation, found in most field theory text-
books, involves splitting the time evolution operator into a product of infinitesimal
pieces and inserting between each factor the identity operator, expressed as a sum over
the projection operators associated with a complete basis of states.
    Taking t = −iβ, we obtain the corresponding Euclidean statement
                                                   Z φ(β)=φ1
                                  −βH
                            hφ1 |e      |φ0i = N               [dφ]e−SEuc (φ(τ )) ,                   (155)
                                                    φ(0)=φ0

where SEuc is the action analytically continued to Euclidean space. Up to a normaliza-
tion factor, these are the matrix elements of the density matrix for the thermal state
e−βH /Z, i.e. the canonical ensemble. This path integral is depicted in figure 23a.
    The partition function Zβ = tr(e−βH ) is obtained by setting φ1 = φ0 and integrating
over φ0 , which is equivalent to defining the path integral on a space with periodic
 36
      Alternatively, this is the set of all points on S d × R spacelike separated from the point p.

as shown in figure 23b. We can similarly define the partial trace over a region Ā to
define the reduced density matrix for the region A in the thermal state. This is

                                                0 , φ (0)=φ (β)


as in figure 23c. A path integral representation of the vacuum state can be obtained
by noting that
                                lim e−βH |Ψi = N |vaci                         (158)
                                   β→∞

since, writing |Ψi as a linear combination of energy eigenstates, all states with en-
ergy higher than the vacuum state energy obtain a relative coefficient e−β(E−Evac ) that
vanishes in the limit. In terms of the path integral, this gives
                                    Z
                      hφ0 |vaci = N        [dφ(τ < 0)]e−SEuc (φ(τ )) ,             (159)
                                         φ(0)=φ0

as depicted in figure 23d. Starting from (157) and taking the limit β → ∞ or work-
ing directly from (159), we obtain a path integral expression for the density matrix
associated with a region A in the vacuum state (figure 23e),
                                              Z φA (0− )=φA1
                                          1

                       1 |ρA |φ0 i =                           [dφ]e−SEuc (φ(τ )) ,       (160)
                                          Z    φA (0+ )=φA
                                                         0


where the field is taken to be continuous across τ = 0 in the region Ā. This is the path
integral over Euclidean space with boundary conditions defined on either side of a cut
at the spatial region A at τ = 0. We will denote this spacetime with the cut by M A .
    It is now straightforward to describe a path integral calculation of the Renyi en-
tropies (21) and entanglement entropy (17). To calculated tr(ρnA ), we take
                           Z
               vac n
         tr((ZρA ) ) =       [dφA     A    vac A           A    vac A    A    vac A
                                 i ]hφ0 |ZρA |φn i · · · hφ2 |ZρA |φ1 ihφ1 |ZρA |φ0 i
                           Z
                       =       [dφ]e−SEuc (φ(τ ))                                     (161)
                            MnA


where MnA is a manifold obtained by taking n copies of Euclidian space M A and
cyclically gluing them together with the fields below the cut one each copy taken
to be continuous with the fields above the cut in the next copy. This is depicted in
figure 23f.
    In order to calculate the entanglement entropy, the standard method (known as
the “replica trick”) is to find an analytic expression for the Renyi entropies Sα in (21)

                                                  68
calculated using (161) and then take the limit α → 1. Alternatively, we can define
the entanglement entropy in terms of the integer Renyi entropies by various integral
identities, for example
                                Z ∞        ∞
                                           X (−a)n

                                                 (n + 1)!

which makes use of the identity
                          Z ∞
                               da −ax
                                  (xe − xe−a ) = −x ln x.                           (163)
                           0    a

The calculation of entanglement entropy (32) for an interval in 2D CFTs can be carried
out directly using these path integral methods, as explained in [18].

Vacuum density matrix for a half space
Using the path integral technology above, we now derive a universal result for the
density matrix of a half-space in the vacuum state of a Lorentz-invariant quantum field
theory. Starting from the expression (160), and denoting the region x1 > 0 by R, we
have                                    Z R − R
                       R vac R        1 φ (0 )=φ1
                     hφ1 |ρR |φ0 i =                 [dφ]e−SEuc (φ(τ )) ,        (164)
                                      Z φR (0+ )=φR0
Next, consider the change of variables to polar coordinates in the x1 , τ plane,x1 =
r cos(θ), τ = r sin(θ). This gives
                                           Z φR (θ=2π)=φR1
                                      1
                   hφR   vac R
                     1 |ρR |φ0 i =                           [dφ]e−SEuc (φ(τ )) ,   (165)
                                      Z     φR (θ=0)=φR
                                                      0


Now, we notice that the expression on the right takes the same form as the expression
(155) with τ replaced by θ and β replaced by 2π. The expression in (155) defined the
density matrix e−βH , where H was the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable
t = iτ . We conclude that the expression (164) defines the density matrix e−2πHη , where
Hη is the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable η = iθ. For this analytically
continued angle coordinate, the metric back in Lorentzian space becomes

                             dr 2 + r 2 dθ2 → dr 2 − r 2 dη 2 ,                     (166)

and we can recognize the metric on the right as describing a Rindler wedge of the
original Minkowski space, defined as the domain of dependence of the half-space x1 > 0.
Explicitly, we have x1 = r cosh(η) and t = r sinh(η). Here η defines ”Rindler time,”
and the associated generator Hη is the ordinary boost generator
                                    Z
                                          dd−1 x x1 T00 .
                                                
                              Hη =                                                (167)
                                       x1 >0


                                                 69
The final result is that the density matrix for a half space is the thermal density matrix
defined in terms of the boost generator,
                                            1 −2πHη
                                     ρR =     e     .                                (168)
                                            Z
As η can be viewed as the time coordinate for a family of observers on accelerated tra-
jectories, this result is closely related to the result of Unruh that accelerated observers
(who only have access to the physics in the Rindler wedge) experience thermal physics.

Modular Hamiltonians
Starting from the result (167,168) for the half-space vacuum density matrix, we can
determine various explicit results for modular Hamiltonians in conformal field theory.
For reference, we record the results here.
   For a ball-shaped region B of radius R and center x0 in Minkowski space, the
modular Hamiltonian H = − log ρB is given by
                                            R2 − (~x − ~x0 )2
                                   Z
                          H = 2π       dd x                   T00 .              (169)
                                     B           2R
For a ball-shaped region θ < θ0 on a sphere, we have
                                         cos(θ) − cos(θ0 )
                                 Z
                         H = 2π     dd x                   T00 .                     (170)
                                  B           sin(θ0 )
In the special case of 1+1 dimensional CFTs the modular Hamiltonian can also be
calculated for thermal state can be obtained from the vacuum state by a conformal
transformation. For a spatial interval [−R, R] in an unboosted thermal state with
temperature T = β −1, the modular Hamiltonian is
                         Z R
                                       π(R − x)
                                                               
                 2β                                      π(R + x)
       H=                  dx sinh              sinh              T00 (x) , (171)
            sinh β 2πR    −R              β                 β

An explicit expression for the modular Hamiltonian of a boosted thermal state can be
found in [55].
