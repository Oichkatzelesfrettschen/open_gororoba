Abstract
This paper deals with the fractional Sobolev spaces W s,p . We analyze the
relations among some of their possible definitions and their role in the trace
theory. We prove continuous and compact embeddings, investigating the
problem of the extension domains and other regularity results.
Most of the results we present here are probably well known to the experts, but we believe that our proofs are original and we do not make use
of any interpolation techniques nor pass through the theory of Besov spaces.
We also present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains.

1. Introduction
These pages are for students and young researchers of all ages who
may like to hitchhike their way from 1 to s ∈ (0, 1). To wit, for anybody
who, only endowed with some basic undergraduate analysis course (and
knowing where his towel is), would like to pick up some quick, crash and
essentially self-contained information on the fractional Sobolev spaces W s,p .
The reasons for such a hitchhiker to start this adventurous trip might
be of different kind: (s)he could be driven by mathematical curiosity,
or could be tempted by the many applications that fractional calculus
seems to have recently experienced. In a sense, fractional Sobolev spaces
have been a classical topic in functional and harmonic analysis all along,
and some important books, such as [59, 90] treat the topic in detail.
On the other hand, fractional spaces, and the corresponding nonlocal

2

equations, are now experiencing impressive applications in different subjects, such as, among others, the thin obstacle problem [87, 69], optimization [37], finance [26], phase transitions [2, 14, 88, 40, 45], stratified
materials [83, 23, 24], anomalous diffusion [68, 98, 65], crystal dislocation [92, 47, 8], soft thin films [57], semipermeable membranes and flame
propagation [15], conservation laws [9], ultra-relativistic limits of quantum mechanics [41], quasi-geostrophic flows [64, 27, 21], multiple scattering [36, 25, 50], minimal surfaces [16, 20], materials science [4], water
waves [81, 100, 99, 32, 29, 74, 33, 34, 31, 30, 42, 51, 75, 35], elliptic
problems with measure data [71, 54], non-uniformly elliptic problems [39],
gradient potential theory [72] and singular set of minima of variational
functionals [70, 56]. Don’t panic, instead, see also [86, 87] for further
motivation.
For these reasons, we thought that it could be of some interest to write
down these notes – or, more frankly, we wrote them just because if you
really want to understand something, the best way is to try and
explain it to someone else.
Some words may be needed to clarify the style of these pages have been
gathered. We made the effort of making a rigorous exposition, starting from
scratch, trying to use the least amount of technology and with the simplest,
low-profile language we could use – since capital letters were always
the best way of dealing with things you didn’t have a good answer
to.
Differently from many other references, we make no use of Besov spaces4
or interpolation techniques, in order to make the arguments as elementary
as possible and the exposition suitable for everybody, since when you are
a student or whatever, and you can’t afford a car, or a plane fare,
or even a train fare, all you can do is hope that someone will stop
and pick you up, and it’s nice to think that one could, even here
and now, be whisked away just by hitchhiking.
Of course, by dropping fine technologies and powerful tools, we will miss
several very important features, and we apologize for this. So, we highly
4

About this, we would like to quote [53], according to which “The paradox of Besov
spaces is that the very thing that makes them so successful also makes them very
difficult to present and to learn”.

recommend all the excellent, classical books on the topic, such as [59, 90, 1,
93, 94, 101, 80, 91, 67, 60], and the many references given therein. Without
them, our reader would remain just a hitchhiker, losing the opportunity of
performing the next crucial step towards a full mastering of the subject
and becoming the captain of a spaceship.
In fact, compared to other Guides, this one is not definitive, and it
is a very evenly edited book and contains many passages that simply
seemed to its editors a good idea at the time. In any case, of course,
we know that we cannot solve any major problems just with potatoes
– it’s fun to try and see how far one can get though.
In this sense, while most of the results we present here are probably well
known to the experts, we believe that the exposition is somewhat original.
These are the topics we cover. In Section 2, we define the fractional
Sobolev spaces W s,p via the Gagliardo approach and we investigate some
of their basic properties. In Section 3 we focus on the Hilbert case p = 2,
dealing with its relation with the fractional Laplacian, and letting the
principal value integral definition interplay with the definition in the Fourier
space. Then, in Section 4 we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the
constant factor that appears in the definition of the fractional Laplacian.
Section 5 is devoted to the extension problem of a function in W s,p(Ω)
to W s,p(Rn ): technically, this is slightly more complicated than the classical analogue for integer Sobolev spaces, since the extension interacts with
the values taken by the function in Ω via the Gagliardo norm and the
computations have to take care of it.
Sobolev inequalities and continuous embeddings are dealt with in Section 6, while Section 7 is devoted to compact embeddings. Then, in Section 8, we point out that functions in W s,p are continuous when sp is large
enough.
In Section 9, we present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains.
After that, we hope that our hitchhiker reader has enjoyed his trip from
the integer Sobolev spaces to the fractional ones, with the advantages
of being able to get more quickly from one place to another particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as
a result of this, very similar to the place you had left.
The above sentences written in old-fashioned fonts are Douglas

Adams’s of course, and we took the latitude of adapting their meanings to
our purposes. The rest of these pages are written in a more conventional,
may be boring, but hopefully rigorous, style.
2. The fractional Sobolev space W s,p
This section is devoted to the definition of the fractional Sobolev spaces.
No prerequisite is needed. We just recall the definition of the Fourier
transform of a distribution. First, consider the Schwartz space S of rapidly
decaying C ∞ functions in Rn . The topology of this space is generated by
the seminorms
X
pN (ϕ) = sup (1 + |x|)N
|D α ϕ(x)| , N = 0, 1, 2, ... ,
x∈Rn

|α|≤N

where ϕ ∈ S (Rn ). Let S ′ (Rn ) be the set of all tempered distributions,
that is the topological dual of S (Rn ). As usual, for any ϕ ∈ S (Rn ), we
denote by
Z
1
F ϕ(ξ) =
e−iξ·x ϕ(x) dx
(2π)n/2 Rn
the Fourier transform of ϕ and we recall that one can extend F from
S (Rn ) to S ′ (Rn ).
Let Ω be a general, possibly non smooth, open set in Rn . For any real
s > 0 and for any p ∈ [1, ∞), we want to define the fractional Sobolev
spaces W s,p (Ω). In the literature, fractional Sobolev-type spaces are also
called Aronszajn, Gagliardo or Slobodeckij spaces, by the name of the ones
who introduced them, almost simultaneously (see [3, 44, 89]).
We start by fixing the fractional exponent s in (0, 1). For any p ∈
[1, +∞), we define W s,p (Ω) as follows
)
(
|u(x)

u(y)|

where the term
[u]W s,p (Ω) :=

Z Z
Ω

|u(x) − u(y)|p
dx dy
n+sp
Ω |x − y|

 p1

is the so-called Gagliardo (semi )norm of u.
It is worth noticing that, as in the classical case with s being an integer,
′
the space W s ,p is continuously embedded in W s,p when s ≤ s′ , as next
result points out.
Proposition 2.1. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and 0 < s ≤ s′ < 1. Let Ω be an open
set in Rn and u : Ω → R be a measurable function. Then
kukW s,p (Ω) ≤ CkukW s′,p (Ω)
for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1. In particular,
′

W s ,p (Ω) ⊆ W s,p (Ω) .
Proof. First,

where we used the fact that the kernel 1/|z|n+sp is integrable since n+ sp >
n.
Taking into account the above estimate, it follows
Z Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p

Ω

Ω |x − y|

≤ C(n, s, p)kukpW s′,p (Ω) ,

which gives the desired estimate, up to relabeling the constant C(n, p, s).
We will show in the forthcoming Proposition 2.2 that the result in
Proposition 2.1 holds also in the limit case, namely when s′ = 1, but for
this we have to take into account the regularity of ∂Ω (see Example 9.1).
As usual, for any k ∈ N and α ∈ (0, 1], we say that Ω is of class C k,α if
there exists M > 0 such that for any x ∈ ∂Ω there exists a ball B = Br (x),
r > 0, and an isomorphism T : Q → B such that
T ∈ C k,α (Q), T −1 ∈ C k,α(B), T (Q+ ) = B ∩ Ω, T (Q0 ) = B ∩ ∂Ω
and kT kC k,α (Q) + kT −1 kC k,α (B) ≤ M,
where

Q := x = (x′ , xn ) ∈ Rn−1 × R : |x′ | < 1 and |xn | < 1 ,

Q+ := x = (x′ , xn ) ∈ Rn−1 × R : |x′ | < 1 and 0 < xn < 1
and Q0 := {x ∈ Q : xn = 0} .

We have the following result.

7

Proposition 2.2. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and s ∈ (0, 1). Let Ω be an open set
in Rn of class C 0,1 with bounded boundary and u : Ω → R be a measurable
function. Then
kukW s,p (Ω) ≤ CkukW 1,p (Ω)
(2.5)
for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1. In particular,
W 1,p (Ω) ⊆ W s,p(Ω) .
Proof. Let u ∈ W 1,p (Ω). Thanks to the regularity assumptions on the
domain Ω, we can extend u to a function ũ : Rn → R such that ũ ∈
W 1,p (Rn ) and kũkW 1,p (Rn ) ≤ CkukW 1,p (Ω) for a suitable constant C (see,
e.g., [49, Theorem 7.25]).
Now, using the change of variable z = y − x and the Hölder inequality,
we have
Z Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p

Therefore, from (2.6) and (2.7) we get estimate (2.5).
We remark that the Lipschitz assumption in Proposition 2.2 cannot be
completely dropped (see Example 9.1 in Section 9); we also refer to the
forthcoming Section 5, in which we discuss the extension problem in W s,p .
Let us come back to the definition of the space W s,p (Ω). Before going
ahead, it is worth explaining why the definition in (2.1) cannot be plainly
extended to the case s ≥ 1. Suppose that Ω is a connected open set in Rn ,
then any measurable function u : Ω → R such that
Z Z
|u(x) − u(u)|p
dx dy < +∞
n+sp
Ω Ω |x − y|
is actually constant (see [10, Proposition 2]). This fact is a matter of
scaling and it is strictly related to the following result that holds for any
u in W 1,p (Ω):

Z Z
|u(x) − u(y)|p

for a suitable positive constant C1 depending only on n and p (see [11]).
In the sameSspirit, in [66], Maz’ja and Shaposhnikova proved that, for
a function u ∈ 0<s<1 W s,p (Rn ), it yields

for a suitable positive constant C2 depending5 only on n and p.

When s > 1 and it is not an integer we write s = m + σ, where m
is an integer and σ ∈ (0, 1). In this case the space W s,p (Ω) consists of
those equivalence classes of functions u ∈ W m,p (Ω) whose distributional
derivatives D α u, with |α| = m, belong to W σ,p (Ω), namely
n
o
W s,p (Ω) := u ∈ W m,p (Ω) : D α u ∈ W σ,p (Ω) for any α s.t. |α| = m
(2.10)
5

For the sake of simplicity, in the definition of the fractional Sobolev spaces and those
of the corresponding norms in (2.1) and (2.2) we avoided any normalization constant.
In view of (2.8) and (2.9), it is worthing notice that, in order to recover the classical
W 1,p and Lp spaces, one may consider to add a factor C(n, p, s) ≈ s(1 − s) in front of
the double integral in (2.2).

9

and this is a Banach space with respect to the norm


kukW s,p (Ω) := kukpW m,p (Ω) +

X

|α|=m

p1

kD α ukpW σ,p(Ω)  .

(2.11)

Clearly, if s = m is an integer, the space W s,p(Ω) coincides with the Sobolev
space W m,p (Ω).
Corollary 2.3. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and s, s′ > 1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn
of class C 0,1 . Then, if s′ ≥ s, we have
′

W s ,p (Ω) ⊆ W s,p(Ω).
Proof. We write s = k + σ and s′ = k ′ + σ ′ , with k, k ′ integers and σ, σ ′ ∈
(0, 1). In the case k ′ = k, we can use Proposition 2.1 in order to conclude
′
that W s ,p (Ω) is continuously embedded in W s,p(Ω). On the other hand, if
k ′ ≥ k + 1, using Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.2 we have the following
chain
′
′
′
W k +σ ,p (Ω) ⊆ W k ,p (Ω) ⊆ W k+1,p(Ω) ⊆ W k+σ,p (Ω) .
The proof is complete.
As in the classic case with s being an integer, any function in the
fractional Sobolev space W s,p (Rn ) can be approximated by a sequence of
smooth functions with compact support.
Theorem 2.4. For any s > 0, the space C0∞ (Rn ) of smooth functions with
compact support is dense in W s,p(Rn ).
A proof can be found in [1, Theorem 7.38].
Let W0s,p (Ω) denote the closure of C0∞ (Ω) in the norm k·kW s,p (Ω) defined
in (2.11). Note that, in view of Theorem 2.4, we have
W0s,p(Rn ) = W s,p (Rn ) ,

(2.12)

but in general, for Ω ⊂ Rn , W s,p (Ω) 6= W0s,p(Ω), i.e. C0∞ (Ω) is not dense in
W s,p(Ω). Furthermore, it is clear that the same inclusions stated in Proposition 2.1, Proposition 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 hold for the spaces W0s,p (Ω).
10

Remark 2.5. For s < 0 and p ∈ (1, ∞), we can define W s,p (Ω) as the dual
space of W0−s,q (Ω) where 1/p + 1/q = 1. Notice that, in this case, the space
W s,p(Ω) is actually a space of distributions on Ω, since it is the dual of a
space having C0∞ (Ω) as density subset.
Finally, it is worth noticing that the fractional Sobolev spaces play an
important role in the trace theory. Precisely, for any p ∈ (1, +∞), assume
that the open set Ω ⊆ Rn is sufficiently smooth, then the space of traces T u
on ∂Ω of u in W 1,p (Ω) is characterized by kT uk 1− p1 ,p
< +∞ (see [43]).
W

(∂Ω)

Moreover, the trace operator T is surjective from W (Ω) onto W 1− p ,p (∂Ω).
In the quadratic case p = 2, the situation simplifies considerably, as we will
see in the next section and a proof of the above trace embedding can be
find in the forthcoming Proposition 3.8.

3. The space H s and the fractional Laplacian operator
In this section, we focus on the case p = 2. This is quite an important
case since the fractional Sobolev spaces W s,2(Rn ) and W0s,2 (Rn ) turn out
to be Hilbert spaces. They are usually denoted by H s (Rn ) and H0s (Rn ),
respectively. Moreover, they are strictly related to the fractional Laplacian
operator (−∆)s (see Proposition 3.6), where, for any u ∈ S and s ∈ (0, 1),
(−∆)s is defined as
Z
u(x) − u(y)

Here P.V. is a commonly used abbreviation for “in the principal value
sense” (as defined by the latter equation) and C(n, s) is a dimensional
constant that depends on n and s, precisely given by

The choice of this constant is motived by Proposition 3.3.

Remark 3.1. Due to the singularity of the kernel, the right hand-side of
(3.1) is not well defined in general. In the case s ∈ (0, 1/2) the integral in
(3.1) is not really singular near x. Indeed, for any u ∈ S , we have
Z

where C is a positive constant depending only on the dimension and on

Now, we show that one may write the singular integral in (3.1) as a
weighted second order differential quotient.
Lemma 3.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let (−∆)s be the fractional Laplacian
operator defined by (3.1). Then, for any u ∈ S ,

(3.3)
Proof. The equivalence of the definitions in (3.1) and (3.3) immediately
follows by the standard changing variable formula.

The above representation is useful to remove the singularity of the integral
at the origin. Indeed, for any smooth function u, a second order Taylor
expansion yields

which is integrable near 0 (for any fixed s ∈ (0, 1)). Therefore, since u ∈ S ,
one can get rid of the P.V. and write (3.3).

Now, we take into account an alternative definition of the space H s (Rn ) =
W s,2(Rn ) via the Fourier transform. Precisely, we may define


Z

n

2
Ĥ (R ) = u ∈ L (R ) :
(1 + |ξ| )|F u(ξ)| dξ < +∞
(3.7)
Rn

and we observe that the above definition, unlike the ones via the Gagliardo
norm in (2.2), is valid also for any real s ≥ 1.
We may also use an analogous definition for the case s < 0 by setting

Ĥ (R ) = u ∈ S (R ) :

Rn

13

although in this case the space Ĥ s (Rn ) is not a subset of L2 (Rn ) and, in
order to use the Fourier transform, one has to start from an element of
S ′ (Rn ), (see also Remark 2.5).
The equivalence of the space Ĥ s (Rn ) defined in (3.7) with the one
defined in the previous section via the Gagliardo norm (see (2.1)) is stated
and proven in the forthcoming Proposition 3.4.
First, we will prove that the fractional Laplacian (−∆)s can be viewed
as a pseudo-differential operator of symbol |ξ|2s . The proof is standard and
it can be found in many papers (see, for instance, [91, Chapter 16]). We
will follow the one in [97] (see Section 3), in which is shown how singular
integrals naturally arise as a continuous limit of discrete long jump random
walks.
Proposition 3.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let (−∆)s : S → L2 (Rn ) be the
fractional Laplacian operator defined by (3.1). Then, for any u ∈ S ,
(−∆)s u = F −1 (|ξ|2s (F u))

∀ξ ∈ Rn .

(3.8)

Proof. In view of Lemma 3.2, we may use the definition via the weighted
second order differential quotient in (3.3). We denote by L u the integral
in (3.3), that is
Z
1
u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)
L u(x) = − C(n, s)
dy,
2
|y|n+2s
Rn

with C(n, s) as in (3.2).
L is a linear operator and we are looking for its “symbol” (or “multiplier”),
that is a function S : Rn → R such that
L u = F −1 (S(F u)).

(3.9)

S(ξ) = |ξ|2s,

(3.10)

We want to prove that
where we denoted by ξ the frequency variable. To this scope, we point out
that
|u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)|
|y|n+2s

≤ C χB1 (y)|y|2−n−2s(1 + |x|n+1 )−1 + χRn \B1 (y)|y|−n−2s ∈ L1 (R2n ).
14

Consequently, by the Fubini-Tonelli’s Theorem, we can exchange the integral in y with the Fourier transform in x. Thus, we apply the Fourier
transform in the variable x in (3.9) and we obtain
S(ξ)(F u)(ξ) = F (L u)

Now, we consider the function I : Rn → R defined as follows

We have that I is rotationally invariant, that is
I(ξ) = I(|ξ|e1 ),

(3.14)

where e1 denotes the first direction vector in Rn . Indeed, when n = 1,
then we can deduce (3.14) by the fact that I(−ξ) = I(ξ). When n ≥ 2,
15

we consider a rotation R for which R(|ξ|e1 ) = ξ and we denote by RT its
transpose. Then, by substituting ỹ = RT y, we obtain

As a consequence of (3.13) and (3.14), the substitution ζ = |ξ|y gives
that

where we recall that C(n, s)

is equal to

Proposition 3.4. Let s ∈ (0, 1). Then the fractional Sobolev space H s (Rn )

This completes the proof.
Remark 3.5. The equivalence of the spaces H s and Ĥ s stated in Proposition 3.4 relies on Plancherel Formula. As well known, unless p = q = 2,
one cannot go forward and backward between an Lp and an Lq via Fourier
transform (see, for instance, the sharp inequality in [5] for the case 1 <
p < 2 and q equal to the conjugate exponent p/(p − 1) ). That is why the
general fractional space defined via Fourier transform for 1 < p < ∞ and
s > 0, say H s,p(Rn ), does not coincide with the fractional Sobolev spaces
W s,p(Rn ) and will be not discussed here (see, e.g., [101]).
Finally, we are able to prove the relation between the fractional Laplacian operator (−∆)s and the fractional Sobolev space H s .
17

Proposition 3.6. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let u ∈ H s (Rn ). Then,
s

[u]2H s (Rn ) = 2C(n, s)−1 k(−∆) 2 uk2L2 (Rn ) .

(3.15)

where C(n, s) is defined by (3.2).
Proof. The equality in (3.15) plainly follows from Proposition 3.3 and
Proposition 3.4. Indeed,
s

s

k(−∆) 2 uk2L2 (Rn ) = kF (−∆) 2 uk2L2(Rn ) = k|ξ|s F uk2L2(Rn )

C(n, s)[u]2H s (Rn ) .
2

Remark 3.7. In the same way as the fractional Laplacian (−∆)s is related
to the space
W s,2 as its
R
 Euler-Lagrange equation or from the formula
2
s
kukW s,2 = u(−∆) u dx , a more general integral operator can be defined
that is related to the space W s,p for any p (see the recent paper [52]).
Armed with the definition of H s (Rn ) via the Fourier transform, we
can easily analyze the traces of the Sobolev functions (see the forthcoming Proposition 3.8). We will follow Sections 13, 15 and 16 in [91].
Let Ω ⊆ Rn be an open set with continuous boundary ∂Ω. Denote by
T the trace operator, namely the linear operator defined by the uniformly
continuous extension of the operator of restriction to ∂Ω for functions
in D(Ω), that is the space of functions C0∞ (Rn ) restricted6 to Ω.
Now, for any x = (x′ , xn ) ∈ Rn and for any u ∈ S (Rn ), we denote by
v ∈ S (Rn−1 ) the restriction of u on the hyperplane xn = 0, that is
v(x′ ) = u(x′ , 0)

∀x′ ∈ Rn−1 .

(3.16)

Then, we have
′

F v(ξ ) =

Z

F u(ξ ′, ξn ) dξn

∀ξ ′ ∈ Rn−1 ,

(3.17)

R

Notice that we cannot simply take T as the restriction operator to the boundary,
since the restriction to a set of measure 0 (like the set ∂Ω) is not defined for functions
which are not smooth enough.

where, for the sake of simplicity, we keep the same symbol F for both the
Fourier transform in n − 1 and in n variables.

Now, we are in position to characterize the traces of the function
in H s (Rn ), as stated in the following proposition.
> 1/2, then any function
Proposition 3.8. ([91, Lemma 16.1]). Let s 

u ∈ H (R ) has a trace v on the hyperplane xn = 0 , such that v ∈
1
H s− 2 (Rn−1 ). Also, the trace operator T is surjective from H s (Rn ) onto
1
H s− 2 (Rn−1 ).
Proof. In order to prove the first claim, it suffices to show that there exists
an universal constant C such that, for any u ∈ S (Rn ) and any v defined
as in (3.16),
(3.19)
kvkH s− 21 (Rn−1 ) ≤ CkukH s(Rn ) .

Remark 3.9. We conclude this section by recalling that the fractional Laplacian (−∆)s , which is a nonlocal operator on functions defined in Rn , may
be reduced to a local, possibly singular or degenerate, operator on functions sitting in the higher dimensional half-space Rn+1
= Rn × (0, +∞).

The cited results turn out to be very fruitful in order to recover an
elliptic PDE approach in a nonlocal framework, and they have recently
been used very often (see, e.g., [18, 88, 13, 17, 78], etc.).

4. Asymptotics of the constant C(n, s)
In this section, we go into detail on the constant factor C(n, s) that
appears in the definition of the fractional Laplacian (see (3.1)), by analyzing
its asymptotic behavior as s → 1− and s → 0+ . This is relevant if one
wants to recover the Sobolev norms of the spaces H 1(Rn ) and L2 (Rn ) by
starting from the one of H s (Rn ).
We recall that in Section 3, the constant C(n, s) has been defined by
C(n, s) =

Precisely, we are interested in analyzing the asymptotic behavior as s → 0+

formula.

We will conclude this section with the following proposition that one
could plainly deduce from Proposition 3.3. We prefer to provide a direct proof, based on Lemma 3.2, in order to show the consistency in the
definition of the constant C(n, s).
Proposition 4.4. Let n > 1. For any u ∈ C0∞ (Rn ) the following statements
hold:
(i) lims→0+ (−∆)s u = u;
(ii) lims→1− (−∆)s u = −∆u.
Proof. Fix x ∈ Rn , R0 > 0 such that supp u ⊆ BR0 and set R = R0 +|x|+1.

5. Extending a W s,p (Ω) function to the whole of Rn
As well known when s is an integer, under certain regularity assumptions on the domain Ω, any function in W s,p (Ω) may be extended to a
function in W s,p(Rn ). Extension results are quite important in applications and are necessary in order to improve some embeddings theorems, in
the classic case as well as in the fractional case (see Section 6 and Section 7
in the following).
For any s ∈ (0, 1) and any p ∈ [1, ∞), we say that an open set Ω ⊆
Rn is an extension domain for W s,p if there exists a positive constant
C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that: for every function u ∈ W s,p(Ω) there exists
ũ ∈ W s,p (Rn ) with ũ(x) = u(x) for all x ∈ Ω and kũkW s,p (Rn ) ≤ CkukW s,p (Ω) .
In general, an arbitrary open set is not an extension domain for W s,p .
To the authors’ knowledge, the problem of characterizing the class of sets
that are extension domains for W s,p is open9 . When s is an integer, we
cite [58] for a complete characterization in the special case s = 1, p = 2 and
n = 2, and we refer the interested reader to the recent book by Leoni [60],
in which this problem is very well discussed (see, in particular, Chapter 11
and Chapter 12 there).
In this section, we will show that any open set Ω of class C 0,1 with
bounded boundary is an extension domain for W s,p .
We start with some preliminary lemmas, in which we will construct the
extension to the whole of Rn of a function u defined on Ω in two separated
cases: when the function u is identically zero in a neighborhood of the
boundary ∂Ω and when Ω coincides with the half-space Rn+ .
Lemma 5.1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn and u a function in W s,p (Ω) with
s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞). If there exists a compact subset K ⊂ Ω such
that u ≡ 0 in Ω \ K, then the extension function ũ defined as
(
u(x) x ∈ Ω ,
(5.1)
ũ(x) =
0
x ∈ Rn \ Ω

While revising this paper, we were informed that an answer to this question has
been given by Zhou, by analyzing the link between extension domains in W s,p and the
measure density condition (see [102]).

belongs to W s,p(Rn ) and
kũkW s,p (Rn ) ≤ CkukW s,p(Ω) ,
where C is a suitable positive constant depending on n, p, s, K and Ω.
Proof. Clearly ũ ∈ Lp (Rn ). Hence, it remains to verify that the Gagliardo
norm of ũ in Rn is bounded by the one of u in Ω. Using the symmetry of
the integral in the Gagliardo norm with respect to x and y and the fact
that ũ ≡ 0 in Rn \ Ω, we can split as follows

Note that the integral in (5.3) is finite since dist(∂Ω, ∂K) ≥ α > 0 and
n + sp > n. Combining (5.2) with (5.3), we get
kũkW s,p (Rn ) ≤ CkukW s,p (Ω)
where C = C(n, s, p, K).
Lemma 5.2. Let Ω be an open set in Rn , symmetric with respect to
the coordinate xn , and consider the sets Ω+ = {x ∈ Ω : xn > 0} and
Ω− = {x ∈ Ω : xn ≤ 0}. Let u be a function in W s,p (Ω+ ), with s ∈ (0, 1)
and p ∈ [1, +∞). Define
(
u(x′ , xn )
xn ≥ 0 ,
(5.4)
ū(x) =
u(x′ , −xn ) xn < 0 .
Then ū belongs to W s,p (Ω) and
kūkW s,p (Ω) ≤ 4kukW s,p(Ω+ ) .

This concludes the proof.
Now, a truncation lemma near ∂Ω.
Lemma 5.3. Let Ω be an open set in Rn , s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞). Let
us consider u ∈ W s,p(Ω) and ψ ∈ C 0,1 (Ω), 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1. Then ψu ∈ W s,p(Ω)
and
kψ ukW s,p (Ω) ≤ CkukW s,p (Ω) ,
(5.6)
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω).
Proof. It is clear that kψ ukLp (Ω) ≤ kukLp (Ω) since |ψ| ≤ 1. Furthermore,
adding and subtracting the factor ψ(x)u(y), we get

|ψ(x) u(x) − ψ(y) u(y)|p

(5.8)

where Λ denotes the Lipschitz constant of ψ and C̃ is a positive constant
depending on n, p and s. Note that the last inequality follows from the fact
that the kernel |x − y|−n+(1−s)p is summable with respect to y if |x − y| ≤ 1
since n + (s − 1)p < n and, on the other hand, the kernel |x − y|−n−sp is
summable when |x − y| ≥ 1 since n + sp > n. Finally, combining (5.7) with
(5.8), we obtain estimate (5.6).
Now, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section, that states
that every open Lipschitz set Ω with bounded boundary is an extension
domain for W s,p.
Theorem 5.4. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω ⊆ Rn be an open set of
class C 0,1 with bounded boundary10 . Then W s,p(Ω) is continuously embedded
in W s,p (Rn ), namely for any u ∈ W s,p(Ω) there exists ũ ∈ W s,p(Rn ) such
that ũ|Ω = u and
kũkW s,p (Rn ) ≤ CkukW s,p (Ω)
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω).
Proof. Since ∂Ω is compact, we can find a finite number of balls Bj such

If we consider this covering, there exists a partition of unity related
to it, i.e. there exist k + 1 smooth functions ψ0 , ψ1 ,..., ψk such that
10
Motivated by an interesting remark of the anonymous Referee, we point out that
it should be expected that the Lipschitz assumption on the boundary of Ω may be
weakened when s ∈ (0, 1), since in the case s = 0 clearly no regularity at all is needed
for the extension problem.

where C = C(n, s, p, Ω) (possibly different step by step, see Lemma 5.1 and
Lemma 5.3).
For any j ∈ {1, ..., k}, let us consider u|Bj ∩Ω and set
vj (y) := u (Tj (y))

for any y ∈ Q+ ,

where Tj : Q → Bj is the isomorphism of class C 0,1 defined in Section 2.
Note that such a Tj exists by the regularity assumption on the domain Ω.
Now, we state that vj ∈ W s,p (Q+ ). Indeed, using the standard changing

where (5.10) follows from the fact that Tj is bi-Lipschitz. Moreover, using
Lemma 5.2 we can extend vj to all Q so that the extension v̄j belongs to
W s,p(Q) and
kv̄j kW s,p (Q) ≤ 4kvj kW s,p (Q+ ) .
We set
wj (x) := v̄j Tj−1 (x)

for any x ∈ Bj .

Since Tj is bi-Lipschitz, by arguing as above it follows that wj ∈
W (Bj ). Note that wj ≡ u (and consequently ψj wj ≡ ψj u) on Bj ∩ Ω.
By definition ψj wj has compact support in Bj and therefore, as done for

with C = C(n, p, s, Ω).
Corollary 5.5. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω be an open set in Rn of
class C 0,1 with bounded boundary. Then for any u ∈ W s,p (Ω), there exists
a sequence {un } ∈ C0∞ (Rn ) such that un → u as n → +∞ in W s,p(Ω), i.e.,
lim kun − ukW s,p (Ω) = 0 .

Proof. The proof follows directly by Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 5.4.

6. Fractional Sobolev inequalities
In this section, we provide an elementary proof of a Sobolev-type inequality involving the fractional norm k · kW s,p (see Theorem 6.5 below).
The original proof is contained in the Appendix of [84] and it deals
with the case p = 2 (see, in particular, Theorem 7 there). We note that
when p = 2 and s ∈ [1/2, 1) some of the statements may be strengthened
(see [10]). We also note that more general embeddings for the spaces W s,p
can be obtained by interpolation techniques and by passing through Besov
spaces; see, for instance, [6, 7, 95, 96, 63]. For a more comprehensive
treatment of fractional Sobolev-type inequalities we refer to [61, 62, 12, 1,
91] and the references therein.
We remark that the proof here is self-contained. Moreover, we will not
make use of Besov or fancy interpolation spaces.
In order to prove the Sobolev-type inequality in forthcoming Theorem 6.5, we need some preliminary results. The first of them is an elementary estimate involving the measure of finite measurable sets E in
Rn as stated in the following lemma (see [85, Lemma A.1] and also [20,
Corollary 24 and 25]).
Lemma 6.1. Fix x ∈ Rn . Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and E ⊂ Rn be a
measurable set with finite measure. Then,

The desired result easily follows by using polar coordinates centered at

Now, we recall a general statement about a useful summability property
(see [84, Lemma 5]. For related results, see also [38, Lemma 4]).
Lemma 6.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Fix T > 1;
let N ∈ Z and
ak be a bounded, nonnegative, decreasing sequence
with ak = 0 for any k ≥ N.
Then,

then ak+1 = 0. Accordingly,

So, recalling (6.2), we obtain the desired result.

We use the above tools to deal with the measure theoretic properties
of the level sets of the functions (see [84, Lemma 6]).
Lemma 6.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let
f ∈ L∞ (Rn ) be compactly supported.

Proof. Notice that
|f (x)| − |f (y)| ≤ |f (x) − f (y)|,
and so, by possibly replacing f with |f |, we may consider the case in
which f ≥ 0.
We define
Ak := {|f | > 2k }.
(6.5)
We remark that Ak+1 ⊆ Ak , hence
ak+1 ≤ ak .

(6.6)

We define
Dk := Ak \ Ak+1 = {2k < f ≤ 2k+1 }

and

dk := |Dk |.

Notice that
dk and ak are bounded and they become zero when k is large enough,
(6.7)
thanks to (6.3). Also, we observe that the Dk ’s are disjoint, that
[

Then, the desired result plainly follows from (6.18) and (6.19).
Lemma 6.4. Let q ∈ [1, ∞). Let f : Rn → R be a measurable function.
For any N ∈ N, let

fN (x) := max min{f (x), N}, −N ∀x ∈ Rn .
(6.20)
Then

lim kfN kLq (Rn ) = kf kLq (Rn ) .

N →+∞

Proof. We denote by |f |N the function obtained by cutting |f | at level N.
We have that |f |N = |fN | and so, by Fatou Lemma, we obtain that

45

Taking into account the previous lemmas, we are able to give an elementary proof of the Sobolev-type inequality stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.5. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Then
there exists a positive constant C = C(n, p, s) such that, for any measurable
and compactly supported function f : Rn → R, we have
Z Z
|f (x) − f (y)|p

kf kLp⋆ (Rn ) ≤ C
dx dy.
(6.21)
|x − y|n+sp
Rn Rn
where p⋆ = p⋆ (n, s) is the so-called “fractional critical exponent” and it is
equal to np/(n − sp).
Consequently, the space W s,p (Rn ) is continuously embedded in Lq (Rn )
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆ ].
Proof. First, we note that if the right hand side of (6.21) is unbounded
then the claim in the theorem plainly follows. Thus, we may suppose that
f is such that
Z Z
|f (x) − f (y)|p
dx dy < +∞.
(6.22)
|x − y|n+sp
Rn Rn
Moreover, we can suppose, without loss of generality, that
f ∈ L∞ (Rn ).

(6.23)

Indeed, if (6.22) holds for bounded functions, then it holds also for the
function fN , obtained by any (possibly unbounded) f by cutting at levels
−N and +N (see (6.20)). Therefore, by Lemma 6.4 and the fact that (6.22)
together with the Dominated Convergence Theorem imply

k∈Z

for a suitable constant C depending on n, p and s.
Finally, it suffices to apply Lemma 6.3 and we obtain the desired result,
up to relabeling the constant C in (6.25).
Furthermore, the embedding for q ∈ (p, p⋆ ) follows from standard application of Hölder inequality.
Remark 6.6. From Lemma 6.1, it follows that
Z Z
dx dy
≥ c(n, s) |E|(n−sp)/n

(6.26)

for all measurable sets E with finite measure.
On the other hand, we see that (6.21) reduces to (6.26) when f = χE ,
so (6.26) (and thus Lemma 6.1) may be seen as a Sobolev-type inequality
for sets.
The above embedding does not generally hold for the space W s,p(Ω)
since it not always possible to extend a function f ∈ W s,p(Ω) to a function
f˜ ∈ W s,p (Rn ). In order to be allowed to do that, we should require further
regularity assumptions on Ω (see Section 5).
Theorem 6.7. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let
Ω ⊆ Rn be an extension domain for W s,p. Then there exists a positive
constant C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that, for any f ∈ W s,p(Ω), we have
kf kLq (Ω) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Ω) ,
47

(6.27)

for any q ∈ [p, p⋆ ]; i.e., the space W s,p(Ω) is continuously embedded in Lq (Ω)
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆ ].
If, in addition, Ω is bounded, then the space W s,p (Ω) is continuously
embedded in Lq (Ω) for any q ∈ [1, p⋆ ].
Proof. Let f ∈ W s,p (Ω). Since Ω ⊆ Rn is an extension domain for W s,p ,
then there exists a constant C1 = C1 (n, p, s, Ω) > 0 such that
kf˜kW s,p (Rn ) ≤ C1 kf kW s,p (Ω) ,

(6.28)

with f˜ such that f˜(x) = f (x) for x a.e. in Ω.
On the other hand, by Theorem 6.5, the space W s,p (Rn ) is continuously
embedded in Lq (Rn ) for any q ∈ [p, p⋆ ]; i.e., there exists a constant C2 =
C2 (n, p, s) > 0 such that
kf˜kLq (Rn ) ≤ C2 kf˜kW s,p (Rn ) .

(6.29)

Combining (6.28) with (6.29), we get
kf kLq (Ω) = kf˜kLq (Ω) ≤ kf˜kLq (Rn ) ≤ C2 kf˜kW s,p (Rn )
≤ C2 C1 kf kW s,p (Ω) ,
that gives the inequality in (6.27), by choosing C = C2 C1 .
In the case of Ω being bounded, the embedding for q ∈ [1, p) plainly
follows from (6.27), by using the Hölder inequality.
Remark 6.8. In the critical case q = p⋆ the constant C in Theorem 6.7
does not depend on Ω: this is a consequence of (6.21) and of the extension
property of Ω.
6.1. The case sp = n
We note that when sp → n the critical exponent p⋆ goes to ∞ and so
it is not surprising that, in this case, if f is in W s,p then f belongs to Lq
for any q, as stated in the following two theorems.
Theorem 6.9. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp = n. Then
there exists a positive constant C = C(n, p, s) such that, for any measurable
and compactly supported function f : Rn → R, we have
kf kLq (Rn ) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Rn ) ,
48

(6.30)

for any q ∈ [p, ∞); i.e., the space W s,p (Rn ) is continuously embedded in
Lq (Rn ) for any q ∈ [p, ∞).
Theorem 6.10. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp = n. Let
Ω ⊆ Rn be an extension domain for W s,p. Then there exists a positive
constant C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that, for any f ∈ W s,p(Ω), we have
kf kLq (Ω) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Ω) ,

(6.31)

for any q ∈ [p, ∞); i.e., the space W s,p(Ω) is continuously embedded
in Lq (Ω) for any q ∈ [p, ∞).
If, in addition, Ω is bounded, then the space W s,p (Ω) is continuously
embedded in Lq (Ω) for any q ∈ [1, ∞).
The proofs can be obtained by simply combining Proposition 2.1 with
Theorem 6.5 and Theorem 6.7, respectively.
7. Compact embeddings
In this section, we state and prove some compactness results involving
the fractional spaces W s,p (Ω) in bounded domains. The main proof is a
modification of the one of the classical Riesz-Frechet-Kolmogorov Theorem
(see [55, 79]) and, again, it is self-contained and it does not require to use
Besov or other interpolation spaces, nor Fourier transform and semigroup
flows (see [28, Theorem 1.5]). We refer to [77, Lemma 6.11] for the case
p = q = 2.
Theorem 7.1. Let s ∈ (0, 1), p ∈ [1, +∞), q ∈ [1, p], Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded
extension domain for W s,p and T be a bounded subset of Lp (Ω). Suppose
that
Z Z
|f (x) − f (y)|p
sup
dx dy < +∞.
|x − y|n+sp
f ∈T Ω Ω
Then T is pre-compact in Lq (Ω).

Proof. We want to show that T is totally bounded in Lq (Ω), i.e., for any
ε ∈ (0, 1) there exist β1 , . . . , βM ∈ Lq (Ω) such that for any f ∈ T there
exists j ∈ {1, . . . , M} such that
kf − βj kLq (Ω) ≤ ε.
49

(7.1)

Since Ω is an extension domain, there exists a function f˜ in W s,p (Rn )
such that kf˜kW s,p (Rn ) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Ω) . Thus, for any cube Q containing Ω,
we have
kf˜kW s,p (Q) ≤ kf˜kW s,p (Rn ) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Ω) .
Observe that, since Q is a bounded open set, f˜ belongs also to Lq (Q)
for any q ∈ [1, p]. Now, for any ε ∈ (0, 1), we let

For any x ∈ Ω, we define

Therefore, we can define

R(f ) := ρn/q q1 (f ), . . . , qN (f ) ∈ RN

that is, the set R(T ) is bounded in RN (with respect to the q-norm of

For any x ∈ Ω, we set
βi (x) := ρ−n/q bi,j(x) ,

This proves (7.1), as desired.
Corollary 7.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let

bounded subset of Lp (Ω). Suppose that
Z Z

Then T is pre-compact in Lq (Ω).
Proof. First, note that for 1 ≤ q ≤ p the compactness follows from Theorem 7.1.
53

For any q ∈ (p, p⋆ ), we may take θ = θ(p, p⋆ , q) ∈ (0, 1) such that
1/q = θ/p + 1 − θ/p⋆ , thus for any f ∈ T and βj with j ∈ {1, ..., N} as in
the theorem above, using Hölder inequality with p/(θq) and p⋆ /((1 − θ)q),
we get

where the last inequalities comes directly from (7.11) and the continuos
embedding (see Theorem 6.7).
Remark 7.3. As well known in the classical case s = 1 (and, more generally,
when s is an integer), also in the fractional case the lack of compactness
for the critical embedding (q = p⋆ ) is not surprising, because of translation
and dilation invariance (see [76] for various results in this direction, for any
0 < s < n/2).
Notice that the regularity assumption on Ω in Theorem 7.1 and Corollary 7.2 cannot be dropped (see Example 9.2 in Section 9).
8. Hölder regularity
In this section we will show certain regularity properties for functions
in W s,p (Ω) when sp > n and Ω is an extension domain for W s,p with no
external cusps. For instance, one may take Ω any Lipschitz domain (recall
Theorem 5.4).
The main result is stated in the forthcoming Theorem 8.2. First, we
need a simple technical lemma, whose proof can be found in [46] (for
instance).

54

Lemma 8.1. ([46, Lemma 2.2]). Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and sp ∈ (n, n + p].
Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a domain with no external cusps and f be a function in
W s,p(Ω). Then, for any x0 ∈ Ω and R, R′ , with 0 < R′ < R < diam(Ω), we
have
|hf iBR (x0 )∩Ω − hf iBR′ (x0 )∩Ω | ≤ c [f ]p,sp |BR (x0 ) ∩ Ω|(sp−n)/np

Theorem 8.2. Let Ω ⊆ Rn be an extension domain for W s,p with no
external cusps and let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) such that sp > n. Then, there
exists C > 0, depending on n, s, p and Ω, such that

dx dy ,
kf kC 0,α(Ω) ≤ C kf kLp (Ω) +
|x − y|n+sp
Ω Ω
for any f ∈ Lp (Ω), with α := (sp − n)/p.
Proof. In the following, we will denote by C suitable positive quantities,
possibly different from line to line, and possibly depending on p and s.
First, we notice that if the right hand side of (8.2) is not finite, then
we are done. Thus, we may suppose that
Z Z
|f (x) − f (y)|p
dx dy ≤ C,
|x − y|n+sp
Ω Ω
for some C > 0.
Second, since Ω is an extension domain for W s,p, we can extend any f
to a function f˜ such that kf˜kW s,p (Rn ) ≤ Ckf kW s,p (Ω) .
Now, for any bounded measurable set U ⊂ Rn , we consider the average
value of the function f˜ in U, given by
Z
1
˜
hf iU :=
f˜(x) dx.

over Br (xo ), we obtain that

Z

|f˜(x) − f˜(y)|p dx dy.

Hence, since |x − y| ≤ 2r for any x, y ∈ Br (xo ), we deduce that

for a suitable constant C.
Now, we will show that f is a continuos function. Taking into account
(8.1), it follows that the sequence of functions x → hf iBR (x)∩Ω converges
uniformly in x ∈ Ω when R → 0. In particular the limit function g will be
continuos and the same holds for f , since by Lebesgue theorem we have
that

f (y) dy = f (x) for almost every x ∈ Ω.

Now, take any x, y ∈ Ω and set R = |x − y|. We have
|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ |f (x) − hf˜iB2R (x) | + |hf˜iB2R (x) − hf˜iB2R (y) | + |hf˜iB2R (y) − f (y)|
56

We can estimate the first and the third term of right hand-side of the
above inequality using Lemma 8.1. Indeed, getting the limit in (8.1) as
R′ → 0 and writing 2R instead of R, for any x ∈ Ω we get
|hf˜iB2R (x) − f (x)| ≤ c [f ]p,sp|B2R (x)|(sp−n)/np ≤ C[f ]p,sp R(sp−n)/p

(8.5)

where the constant C is given by c 2(sp−n)/p /|B1 |.
On the other hand,
|hf˜iB2R (x) − hf˜iB2R (y) | ≤ |f (z) − hf˜iB2R (x) | + |f˜(z) − hf˜iB2R (y) |
and so, integrating on z ∈ B2R (x) ∩ B2R (y), we have

Furthermore, since BR (x) ∪ BR (y) ⊂ B2R (x) ∩ B2R (y) , we have

|BR (x)| ≤ |B2R (x) ∩ B2R (y)| and |BR (y)| ≤ |B2R (x) ∩ B2R (y)|

Z

|f˜(z) − hf˜iB2R (y) | dz ≤ C [f ]p,sp R(sp−n)/p .
|BR (y)| B2R (y)

Combining (8.5), (8.6) with (8.7) it follows
|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ C [f ]p,sp |x − y|(sp−n)/p ,

(8.8)

up to relabeling the constant C.
Therefore, by taking into account (8.4), we can conclude that f ∈
C 0,α (Ω), with α = (sp − n)/p.
Finally, taking R0 < diam(Ω) (note that the latter can be possibly
infinity), using estimate in (8.5) and the Hölder inequality we have, for
any x ∈ Ω,
|f (x)| ≤ |hf˜iBR0 (x) | + |f (x) − hf˜iBR0 (x) |

(8.9)

Remark 8.3. The estimate in (8.3) says that f belongs to the Campanato
space L p,λ, with λ := sp, (see [22] and, e.g., [46, Definition 2.4]). Then,
the conclusion in the proof of Theorem 8.2 is actually an application of the
Campanato Isomorphism (see, for instance, [46, Theorem 2.9]).
Just for a matter of curiosity, we observe that, according to the definition (2.1), the fractional Sobolev space W s,∞ (Ω) could be view as the
space of functions


|u(x) − u(y)|
∞
∞
u ∈ L (Ω) :

|x − y|s
but this space just boils down to C 0,s (Ω), that is consistent with the
Hölder embedding proved in this section; i.e., taking formally p = ∞
in Theorem 8.2, the function u belongs to C 0,s (Ω).
9. Some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains
When the domain Ω is not Lipschitz, some interesting things happen,
as next examples show.
Example 9.1. Let s ∈ (0, 1). We will construct a function u in W 1,p (Ω) that
does not belong to W s,p (Ω), providing a counterexample to Proposition 2.2
when the domain is not Lipschitz.
Take any
p ∈ (1/s, +∞).

(9.1)

p+1
.
sp − 1

(9.2)

Due to (9.1), we can fix
κ>
We remark that κ > 1.

Let us consider the cusp in the plane

C := (x1 , x2 ) with x1 ≤ 0 and |x2 | ≤ |x1 |κ

and take polar coordinates on R2 \ C, say ρ = ρ(x) ∈ (0, +∞) and θ =
θ(x) ∈ (−π, π), with x = (x1 , x2 ) ∈ R2 \ C.

59

We define the function u(x) := ρ(x)θ(x) and the heart-shaped domain Ω := (R2 \ C) ∩ B1 , with B1 being the unit ball centered in the
origin. Then, u ∈ W 1,p (Ω) \ W s,p(Ω).
To check this, we observe that
∂x1 ρ = (2ρ)−1 ∂x1 ρ2 = (2ρ)−1 ∂x1 (x21 + x22 ) =
and, in the same way,
∂x2 ρ =

x1
ρ

x2
.
ρ

Accordingly,
1 = ∂x1 x1 = ∂x1 (ρ cos θ) = ∂x1 ρ cos θ − ρ sin θ∂x1 θ =

x21
− x2 ∂x1 θ
ρ2

x22
− x2 ∂x1 θ.
ρ2

That is

x2
∂x1 θ = − 2 .
ρ

By exchanging the roles of x1 and x2 (with some care on the sign of the
derivatives of the trigonometric functions), one also obtains
∂x2 θ =

x1
.
ρ2

Therefore,
∂x1 u = ρ−1 (x1 θ − x2 ) and ∂x2 u = ρ−1 (x2 θ + x1 )
and so
|∇u|2 = θ2 + 1 ≤ π 2 + 1.
This shows that u ∈ W 1,p (Ω).
On the other hand, let us fix r ∈ (0, 1), to be taken arbitrarily small
at the end, and let us define r0 := r and, for any j ∈ N, rj+1 := rj − rjκ .
By induction, one sees that rj is strictly decreasing, that rj > 0 and
so rj ∈ (0, r) ⊂ (0, 1). Accordingly, we can define
ℓ := lim rj ∈ [0, 1].
j→+∞

60

ℓ = lim rj+1 = lim rj − rjκ = ℓ − ℓκ ,

x2 ∈ (|x1 |κ , 2|x1 |κ ) and − y2 ∈ (|y1 |κ , 2|y1|κ ) .

We observe that

(x, y) ∈ R2 × R2 s.t. x1 , y1 ∈ (−r, 0),
x2 ∈ (|x1 |κ , 2|x1 |κ ) and − y2 ∈ (|y1 |κ , 2|y1|κ )

for small r. Hence, if (x, y) ∈ Dj ,
|x1 | ≤ rj ≤ 2rj+1 ≤ 2|y1 |
and, analogously,
|y1 | ≤ 2|x1 |.
Moreover, if (x, y) ∈ Dj ,
κ
|x1 − y1 | ≤ rj − rj+1 = rjκ ≤ 2κ rj+1

and
|x2 − y2 | ≤ |x2 | + |y2 | ≤ 2|x1 |κ + 2|y1|κ ≤ 2κ+2|x1 |κ .
61

As a consequence, if (x, y) ∈ Dj ,
|x − y| ≤ 2κ+3 |x1 |κ .
Notice also that, when (x, y) ∈ Dj , we have θ(x) ≥ π/2 and θ(y) ≤ −π/2,

✷

Example 9.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1). We will construct a sequence of functions
{fn } bounded in W s,p (Ω) that does not admit any convergent subsequence
in Lq (Ω), providing a counterexample to Theorem 7.1 when the domain is
not Lipschitz.
We follow an observation by [82]. For the sake of simplicity, fix n =
p = q = 2.
We take ak := 1/C k for a constant C > 10 and we consider the
S∞
set Ω = k=1 Bk where, for any k ∈ N, Bk denotes the ball of radius a2k
centered in ak . Notice that
ak → 0 as k → ∞ and ak − a2k > ak+1 + a2k+1 .
Thus, Ω is the union of disjoint balls, it is bounded and it is not a Lipschitz
domain.
For any n ∈ N, we define the function fn : Ω → R as follows

Thanks to the choice of {ak } we have that

Thus, since x ∈ Bn , y ∈ Bk , it follows
|x − y| ≥ |an − a2n − (ak + a2k )| = |an − ak − (a2n + a2k )|
|an − ak |
