Abstract

          In this work, we analyze two models beyond the Standard Model’s descriptions that make
ad hoc hypotheses of three point-like lepton and quark generations without explanations of their
physical origins. Instead of using the same Dirac equation involving four anti-commutative
matrices for all such structure-less elementary particles, we consider in the first model the use of
sixteen direct-product matrices of quaternions that are related to Dirac’s gamma matrices. This
associative direct-product matrix model could not generate three fermion generations satisfying
Einstein’s’ mass-energy relation. We show that sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion
sub-algebras and three octonion sub-algebras but with a common intersecting quaternion algebra.
This model naturally leads to precisely three generations as each of the non-associative octonion
sub-algebra leads to one fermion generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of basis sedenion
operators to construct twenty-four 5x5 generalized lambda matrices representing SU(5) generators,
in analogy to the use of octonion basis operators to construct Gell-Mann’s eight 3x3 lambda
matrices for SU(3) generators. Thus, this work links the sedenion algebra to Georgi-Glashaw’s
SU(5) Grand Unification Theory (GUT) that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions for
known Standard Model’s elementary particles.

    1. Introduction
        The Dirac equation is the Standard Model's cornerstone for describing all fermionic
elementary particles [1-3]. According to the ad hoc assumptions, three generations of leptons and
quarks are point-like objects without a physical size [4-6]. However, such a long-held conceptual
picture of a point-like particle is inconsistent with observations. For example, why there exist
precisely three generations of leptons and quarks [7], and why could a point-like muon or tau be
much heavier than an electron [8, 9]. And, for the six types of point-like quarks, why are charm,
strange, top, and bottom quarks heavier than up and down quarks [10, 11]. In Dirac’s theory of a
relativistic electron, he coupled four 4x4 anti-commutative matrices α1, α 2 , α 3 , β , or equivalently

 0 ,  ,1,  , 2 ,  3 , to the 1st-order derivatives in space and time to describe the wave [12, 13]. By
extending the operator techniques beyond Dirac’s theory, one can include additional operators in
a higher dimension to describe a particle’s internal degrees of freedom. In this work, we analyze
two types of higher dimensional generalization using the direct-product operators constructed from
Pauli’s matrices versus hyper-complex operators beyond quaternions [14-15] which is equivalent
to Dirac’s 4x4 gamma-matrices. Like the 4-element quaternion algebra with three anti-
commutative basis operators [16], the 8-element octonion algebra contains seven anti-
commutative basis operators, but unlike the associative quaternion algebra, the octonion algebra
is non-associative [17-20]. In this work, we will examine the corresponding multiplication rules
and compare their multiplication tables to clarify the similarities, differences, and the physical
implications.

        In Sec. 2.1 we shall briefly review Dirac’s original model and its connection to the
quaternion algebra. In Sec. 2.2, we consider a higher dimensional model beyond Dirac’s use of
four anti-commutative gamma matrices. We analyze the group of 16 direct-product operators
constructed from quaternions or, equivalently, Pauli’s matrices and an identity operator, which are
related to 16 Dirac’s gamma. In Sec. 2.3, we discuss the non-associative 16-element sedenion
algebra [21-24], and show it is composed of three distinctive octonion algebras. We shall analyze
its differences from the direct-product case,and examine whether the corresponding mass-energy
relation is consistent with Einstein’s special relativity. In Sec. 2.5, we shall show how proper
operator assignment of the operators from three octonion sub-algebras can naturally lead to the
rise of three generations of lepton and quarks. Finally, in Sec. 2.6, we shall present a mapping of
octonions to 8 SU(3) generators, and a mapping of sedenion operators to 24 generators for SU(5),
which was proposed by Geogi-Glashow [25,26] for their GUT model for grand unification of the
Standard Model’s elementary particles.



    1. Theory

        In this section, we present a theoretical analysis of an associative algebra model using
Dirac’s gamma matrices, which are related to direct-product operators which are constructed from
quaternions or equivalently Pauli’s matrices and an identity matrix, versus non-associative algebra
model based on octonion and sedenion operators. This work extends Dirac’s original theory for
the electron to three generations of leptons and quarks, and extends the Standard Model beyond
the ad hoc assumption of a point-like elementary fermions. We shall show that the sedenion
algebra provides a key link to SU(5) symmetry of GUT. This hyper-complex operator model with
higher degrees of freedom leads precisely to three generations of leptons/quarks which possess
internal structures.



2.1. Dirac equation

        According to Dirac’s theory for the electron, using the gamma matrices one has

        (i     − m ) = 0,  = 0,1, 2, 3
         p k = − i  k , p0 = i  0                                                    (1A)
                              0      k                        I      0 
         k = =  t   k =            ,  0 = =  3   0 =  2         .
                             −k      0                         0    − I 2 


where the natural unit  = c = 1 is used. Here, we define five 2x2 matrices, including Pauli’s

matrices  1 `,  2 ,  3 , , an identity matrix I 2 and  t  i 2 , as

               0 1           0 − i         1 0                     1 0
         1 =      ,  2 =     ,  3 =        ,  0 = I 2 =      ,     (1B)
               1 0 `          i 0            0 − 1 `                0 1

Equivalently, using the matrices α k =  0 k and β =  0 , the Dirac equation can also be expressed
as E = ( α  P + βm ) . The identity matrix and three Pauli matrices form the basis operators for
quaternion algebra. Based on Dirac’s1st-order differential equation in spacetime one obtains
Einstein’s relativistic mass-energy relation E 2 = m 2 + p 2 . These Dirac’s gamma matrices in
I ,  ,  ,  ,   are used in the Dirac equation. However, the product of these matrices does
  4
       0     ,1    ,2    3


not satisfy the closure property, for example,  1 2 =  0   3 does not belong to the same set,
therefore, these five operators do not form a group.

   In the Standard Model the same Dirac equation is used for all leptons and quarks, assuming
these particles are a point-like object with an infinitely small volume, it does not offer physical
explanations to exist precisely why there are three generations. To generalize Dirac equation to
higher dimensions, and to account for three fermion generations by incorporating internal
structural dynamics, we consider in the following sections two modelling approaches, i.e., an
direct-product matrix model of 16 associative 4x4 matrices versus non-associative hype-complex
algebra of 16 sedenion basis operators..



2.2. Associative algebra of 16 direct-product matrices
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1 , U 2 , U 3 , Θ2 , V1 , V2 , V3 , Θ3 , W1 , W2 , W3 

           To generalize Dirac’s description of the electron using four Dirac’s gamma matrices
  ( = 0,1, 2, 3), , we can define a set of direct-product operators using three Pauli’s matrices and

an identity matrix as

            ij   i   j
                                                                                                           (2)
           U k = i 1k , Vk = i 2 k Wk = i 3k , Γ k = i 0k Θk = i k 0

One can show that the eight-element set of direct-product operators I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1, U 2 , U3

form a group with the closure property for multiplication. Similarly, one can show that the other
two sets          I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 and      I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 form a group for
multiplication. These direct-product operators can be related to the sixteen direct-product matrices
of quaternions. The multiplication table for the sixteen direct-product operators, which are related
to Dirac’s gamma matrices, is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Figure 1. The color-coded multiplication table for 16 direct-product operators. Among the sixteen
operators, the 4-th, 8-th and 12-th operators are commutative with other operators although most
are anti-commutative. These properties differs from that of sedenion algebra. This 16-element
group contains three 8-element sub-groups with closure property for multiplication, namely,
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1, U 2 , U3 , I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 and I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 . Each
domain containing quaternion triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules.



        Here we summarize their multiplication rules for these sixteen direct-product operators

         U i U j = − ijk Γ k −  ij I, Vi V j = − ijk Γ k −  ij I, Wi W j = − ijk Γ k −  ij I
         Γ i Γ j = −  ijk Γ k −  ij I, Θ i Θ j = − ijk Θ k −  ij I
         U i V j = − i ijk Wk −  ij Θ3 ,
         V j U i = − i ijk Wk +  ij Θ3                                                                      (3A)
         Vi W j = − i ijk U k +  ij Θ1 ,
         W j Vi = − i ijk U k +  ij Θ1 ,
         Wi U j = − i ijk Vk +  ij Θ 2

and
        U i Γ j = − 1i 0 j = − i ijk 1k −  ij 10 = −  ijk U k + i ij 1
        Γ j U i = − 0 j 1i = i ijk 1k −  ij 10 =  ijk U k + i ij 1
        Vi Γ j = −  ijk Vk + i ijΘ2
                                                                                                            (4B)
        Γ j Vi =  ijk Vk + i ijΘ2
        Wi Γ j = −  ijk Wk + i ij 3
        Γ j Wi =  ijk Wk + i ij3

and

        Γi Γ j = −  ijk Γk −  ij I, Θi Θ j = − ijkΘk −  ij I

`       Θ1Γ k = Γ k Θ1 = i U k , Θ2 Γ k = Γ k Θ2 = i Vk , Θ3Γ k = Γ k Θ3 = i Wk


        U k Θ1 = Θ1U k = iΓ k , Vk Θ 2 = Θ 2 Vk = iΓ k , Wk Θ3 = Θ3 Wk = iΓ k
        U k 2 = −2 U k = − Wk , U k 3 = −3U k = Vk
                                                                                                            (4C)
        Vk 1 = −1Vk = Wk , Vk 3 = −3 Vk = −U k
        Wk 1 = −1Wk − Vk , Wk 2 = −2 Wk = U k .

This 16-element group contains three 8-element subgroups, namely, I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1, U 2 , U3 ,
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 and I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 . These three subgroups with eight
elements of 4x4 matrices satisfy the closure and associative properties. They differ from the non-
associative octonions algebra which will be discussed in details later in Sec. 2.3.

`       Here, we examine the mass-energy relation based on the operators according to the first
sub-group I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1, U 2 , U3 . We can extend Dirac’s equation involving four gamma
matrices to higher dimensions involving eight direct-product operators as

                            3            3
        m0 = iEΘ1 +  Pk Γ k +  Qk U k                                                              (5A)
                         k =1          k =1


By taking the square of both sides of the equation, one obtains


                                                          Pi Pj Γi , Γ j +  QiQ j U i , U j 

                                                                                                            (5B)
                               

            i , j =1                     k =1


or, equivalently, according to the multiplication rules in Fig. 1, one has
                              (          ) − iΘ  P Q − iE  (P U + Q Γ )

                                                                                                                     (5C)



Similarly, for the second assignments using I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3, one has

                          3             3
         m0 = iEΘ 2 +  Pk Γ k , +  Qk Vk ,

                                                                                                                     (5D)

and for I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3, one obtains

In Equations (5A), (5D) and (5E), the last two terms of the equations involve operators
Θ k , Γ k , U k , Vk or Wk which lead to mass-energy oscillations in time for a lepton and quark.

Therefore, such results are neither consistent with experimental observations nor in agreement

                                                                                         (
with Einstein’s mass-energy relation of E 2 = m02 + k Pk 2 + Qk 2 which contains an additional              )
kinetic energy k Qk 2 due to a particle’s internal structural dynamics. Therefore, although the

16-element group of direct-product operator contains three 8-element subgroup, the above direct-
product model cannot represent three generations of leptons and quarks. In the following sections,
we will discuss the non-associative sedenion and octonion algebras, and show that they do not
encounter these problems facing the associative direct-product operator model.




2.3. Non-associative octonion algebra and one fermion generation
     We consider the octonion algebra to avoid the problems facing the direct-product matrix
model. Any element x and its conjugate x in the octonion algebra, x can be expressed in terms
of the identity operator e 0 and seven other octonion unit operators

                                               7
        x = x0 e 0 + X , x = x0 e 0 − X , X =  x k e k ,                                      (6A)
                                              k =1


                                                               
where e k satisfies the anti-commutative relation e i , e j = 0, i  j for a different pair of indices.

These non-associative octonion operators follow the specific multiplication rules in Fig. 2.




Fig. 2. The color-coded multiplication table for the eight basis octonions. According to the
multiplication rules, other than the identity operator, all other seven operators anti-commute with
each other, however, the multiplications are not associative. The arrays are color-coded to illustrate
domains of cyclic multiplication rules for quaternions. Each color-coded domain of quaternion
triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules.



       For the octonion algebra of Fig. 2, the 4th element anti-commutes with all other operators
except the identity operator. However, in Fig. 1 for the direct-product operators, the 4th element
a4 , a8 or a12 is commutative with all other operators, except the identity element. This property

is important for the corresponding mass-energy relation to be consistent with Einstein’s relativity.
Therefore, the model with seven non-associative but anti-commutative octonion operators is the
correct model to describe one generation of lepton or quark. The octonion model invokes three
extra degrees of freedom to represent the internal structural dynamics of a fermion as three
momentum components with respect to the center-of-mass reference frame, whereas the other
three anti-commutative operators represent the external degrees of freedom as three momentum
operators for the particle with respect to the laboratory frame.



2.4. Three octonion sub-algebras in sedenion algebra and three generations of
charged/neutral leptons
         In the last section, we explain that the octonion algebra leads to only one fermion
generation. To accommodate three generations, one needs to consider higher-dimensional
hypercomplex algebra, namely, the sedenion algebra. In the sedenion algebra, it consists of 16
basis          ssedenion              operators            e k , k = 0,1, 2, ..., 15      ,         denoted             as
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1, U1, U 2 , U3, Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 , , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 sequentially.

The multiplication rules for 16 sedenion basis operators are given in Fig. 3, and is different from
the table for the direct-product operator model shown earlier in Fig. 31




Fig. 3. The color-coded multiplication table for16 basis sedenion operators e k , k = 0,1, 2, ..., 15 .
The region algebra contains three distinct types of octonion sub-algebras, denoted by
I, Γ1 , Γ 2 , Γ3 , Θ1 , U1 , U 2 , U 3 , I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 and I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 . Each
color-coded domain containing quaternion triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules. Unlike the
table in Fig. 1 for the associative direct-product matrices, the 4-th, 8-th and 12-th operators in the
non-associative sedenion algebra anti-commutes with U, V, W operators.

         The multiplication table in Fig. 3 can be rearranged in order to become Fig. 4 to illustrate
that the sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion algebras with each quaternion algebra
representing a distinct type of SU(2) spinors with a cyclic multiplication rule.

of spinor triad together with an unit operator forms a quaternion algebra.


         As can be seen from Fig. 3, the sedenion algebra contains three distinct types of octonion
algebra, which are denoted by I, Γ1 , Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ1 , U1 , U 2 , U3, I, Γ1 , Γ 2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1 , V2 , V3  and
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 .

The multiplication tables for these three distinct types of octonion algebra are illustrated in Fig.

The above result is consistent with Einstein’s mass-energy relation indicating the octonion model
gives rise to one generation of fermion with an internal structural dynamic. Similarly, for

The     above             three              equations                reproduce           Einstein’s   mass-energy   relation,   i.e.,

generations of the neutral leptons, i.e., the corresponding neutrino for each generation of leptons,
we use the following assignments

Owing to the absence of k Qk 2 in the above results for three neutrino generations, one has a

vanishingly small rest mass E 2  k Pk 2 if m0 is close to zero. Unlike the cases for the charged
                                                                
leptons, one has E 2 = m0,eff 2 + k Pk 2 , where m0,eff 2 = m02 + k Qk 2  k Qk 2 even if m0 is

close to zero. According to the above sedenion model, their masses could be close to zero and are
much smaller than those of their corresponding leptons. The experimental observations of flavor
mixing and the mass oscillations among three generations of neutrinos are believed to be induced
by the symmetry breaking mechanism.

2.6. Mapping octonions to SU(3) generators and sedenion to SU(5) generators
         In this section, we discuss the mapping of the octonion operators to 8 SU(3) generators and
the mapping of sedenion operators to 24 SU(5) generators. For each type of octonion algebra, one
can show its isomorphism to Clifford algebra𝐶ℓ(6) [20]. Here, we define three pairs of fermion

creation and annihilation operators  k+ and  k which satisfy the anti-commutation relations as

          1 = (− e6 + ie5 ) 2 ,  2 = (− e3 + ie1 ) 2 , 3 = (− e7 + ie2 ) 2
          i , j = i+ , +j = 0 , i , +j  =  ij                                             (10A)


For the first lepton/quark generation, these eight basis octonion operators are denoted by
I, Γ1 , Γ 2 , Γ3 , Θ1 , U1 , U 2 , U 3 

          1 = (− U2 + iU1 ) 2 ,  2 = (− Γ3 + iΓ1 ) 2 , 3 = (− U3 + iΓ2 ) 2
                                                                                                       (10B)
          a1+ = (U 2 + iU1 ) 2 , a2+ = (Γ3 + iΓ1 ) 2 , a3+ = (U3 + iΓ2 ) 2 .

                        +
One can define i j   i  j to construct the following eight SU(3) generators which are related

to Gell-Mann’s lambda matrices Λ k as

          Λ1 = 2 1 + 1 2 = i (U 3 − U 2 ) 2
          Λ 2 = − i 1 2 + i 2 1 = − i (U1 − Θ1 ) 2
          Λ 3 = 1 1 − 2 2 = i (Γ 3 − Γ 2 ) 2
          Λ 4 = 1 3 + 3 1 = i (Θ1 − Γ 2 ) 2
                                                                                                       (10C)
          Λ 5 = − i 1 3 + i 3 1 = − − i (Γ1 + U 3 ) 2
          Λ 6 = 2 3 + 3 2 = − i (Γ1 + U 2 ) 4
          Λ 7 = − i 2 3 + i 3 2 = − i (Θ1 − Γ3 ) 2
          Λ8 = ( 1 1 + 2 2 − 2 3 3 )           3 = i (Γ 3 + Γ 2 − 2U 2 ) 2 .

         We have shown above the eight lambda matrices as the SU(3) generators which can be
constructed from I, Γ1 , Γ 2 , Γ 3 , Θ1 , U1 , U 2 , U 3  . Because the sedenion algebra is shown to consist
of three octonion sub-algebras. Similarly, one can use two other octonion basis sets, i.e.,
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ2 , V1, V2 , V3 and I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , Θ3 , W1, W2 , W3 to construct two other lambda-matrix
generators. Together with the U-type, V-type and W-type octonion algebras which are the three
distinct sub-algebra of the sedenion algebra, we can construct all together 24 generators for SU(5).
       By extending the three pairs of creation and annihilation and creation operators for the
octonion algebra, we define five pairs of fermion creation and annihilation operators for the
sedenion algebra as

       1 = (− e6 + ie5 ) 2 ,  2 = (− e3 + ie1 ) 2 ,  3 = (− e7 + ie2 ) 2
       5 = (− e14 + ie13 ) 2 ,  6 = (− e11 + ie9 ) 2                                                  (11A)
        i , j =  i+ , +j = 0 ,  i , +j  =  ij ,
or, equivalently

       1 = (− U 2 + iU1 ) 2 ,  2 = (− Γ3 + iΓ1 ) 2 , 3 = (− U3 + iΓ2 ) 2
                                                                                                        (11B)
        a4 = (− V2 + iV1 ) 2 , a5 = (− W2 + iW1 ) 2 .

Similar to Eq. (10C) by constructing eight of 3x3 lambda matrices for the SU(3) generators from
three pairs of creation and annihilation operators, one can construct from five pairs of fermion[c
creation and annihilation operators, a total of twenty-four generalized lambda matrices as the
SU(5) generators. Using the five pairs of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , one can
construct          10      pairs       of          5x5         off-diagonal   SU(5)   generator   matrices   as
m n + n m , − i m n + i n m , for m  n =1, 2, .., 5. And, with the same indices one can construct

four off-diagonal but orthogonal 5x5 matrices.                       Therefore, among these twenty-four SU(5)
generators which can be represented by 5x5 generalized lambda matrices, there are four diagonal
matrices and twenty off-diagonal matrices.                     The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential role in the
GUT (grand unification theory) that has been advocated to unify the electromagnetic, weak and
strong interactions among elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion
algebra are not totally independent of each other because they contain the same quaternion algebra
I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 . Such an intersection among three octonion sub-algebras underlies the quark
confinement mechanism. The cooling after the big bang of the universe plays an important role in
symmetry breaking of SU(5) to become SU(3)  SU(2)  U(1) , and the break sown of the
sedenion algebra into direct-product of octonion and quaternion algebras. Such breakdown results
in flavor mixing of neutrinos and their mass oscillations.



3. Conclusions
     In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of higher dimensional models beyond the
conventional Dirac model for a point-like fermion without a volume or an internal structure. Dirac
utilized four anti-commutative matrices to couple to the first derivative of particle’s space and time
coordinates. Such an extension is necessary, because the traditional Dirac theory cannot explain
the origins for the observed three generations of leptons and quarks postulated in the Standard
Model. We first consider an 16-element group of 4x4 matrices as direct products of quaternion
operators, i.e., three 2x2 Pauli’s matrices and an identity matrix. This model contains three extra
degrees of freedom to incorporate a particle’s internal structure. This 16-element group contains
three 8-element subgroups, possessing a closure property for multiplications among eight elements
of each subgroup. However, this direct-product matrix model with associative operators could not
reproduce Einstein’s mass-energy relation, in contrast to the model with 16 sedenion basis
operators. The significant difference between the two models is the associativity of whether
multiplication is associative or not, as clearly illustrated from the differences in the multiplication
tables of Figs. 1 and 2. The 8-element octonion algebra is shown to be able to lead to one lepton
generation, however, we need 16-element sedenion algebra to encompass precisely three
generation of leptons and quarks. We have shown from the color-code table arrays in Fig. 2, the
sedenion algebra contains three distinct octonion algebras, with the U, V, and W-type operators,
and each type of octonion sub-algebra corresponding to one generation. We have also shown for
neutrinos that from Eq. (7) the effective rest mass could be vanishingly small in comparison to that
in Eq. (6) for the counterpart charged leptons. We have also provided operator assignments in
Equations (8) and (9) to represent three generations of lighter and heavier quarks. Moreover, we
have shown that by properly pairing up the octonion basis operators one an construct 8 3x3 Gell-
Mann’s lambda matrices as the 8 generators for SU(3). For the U, V and W-type octonion sub-
algebra of the sedenion algebra, we could pair up the sedenion basis operators to construct a total
of 24 5x5 matrices to represent the 24 generators of SU(5). The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential
role in the GUT that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions among the Standard Model’s
elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion algebra contain the same
quaternions I, Γ1, Γ2 , Γ3 , and such an intersection underlies the quark confinement mechanism.
Soon after the big bang of the universe, its cooling plays an important role in symmetry breaking
for SU(5) to be broken down to become SU(3)  SU(2)  U(1) [25, 26], and the broken sedenion
algebra into direct-product algebra of octonions and quaternions results in flavor mixing of
neutrinos to induce the mass oscillation behavior.
