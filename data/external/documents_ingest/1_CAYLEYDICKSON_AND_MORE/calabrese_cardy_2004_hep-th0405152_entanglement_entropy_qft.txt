                                      We carry out a systematic study of entanglement entropy in relativistic quantum field theory.
                                    This is defined as the von Neumann entropy SA = −Tr ρA log ρA corresponding to the reduced
                                    density matrix ρA of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose
                                    continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result SA ∼
                                    (c/3) log ℓ of Holzhey et al. when A is a finite interval of length ℓ in an infinite system, and extend
                                    it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary
                                    number of disjoint intervals (See note added). For such a system away from its critical point,
                                    when the correlation length ξ is large but finite, we show that SA ∼ A(c/6) log ξ, where A is the
                                    number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is
                                    also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable
                                    lattice models, such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix
                                    methods. Finally the free-field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a
                                    scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.

I.    INTRODUCTION.


     Recently there has been considerable interest in formulating measures of quantum entan-
glement and applying them to extended quantum systems with many degrees of freedom,
such as quantum spin chains.
     One of these measures[1] is entanglement entropy. Suppose the whole system is in a pure
quantum state |Ψi, with density matrix ρ = |ΨihΨ|, and an observer A measures only a
subset A of a complete set of commuting observables, while another observer B may measure
the remainder. A’s reduced density matrix is ρA = TrB ρ. The entanglement entropy is just
the von Neumann entropy SA = −TrA ρA log ρA associated with this reduced density matrix.
It is easy to see that SA = SB . For an unentangled product state, SA = 0. Conversely, SA
should be a maximum for a maximally entangled state.
     For example, for a system with two binary (spin- 12 ) degrees of freedom, with |Ψi =
cos θ| ↑↓i + sin θ| ↓↑i, where A observes only the first spin and B the second, SA takes its
maximum value of log 2 when cos2 θ = 12 , which agrees with our intuitive idea of maximal
entanglement. For this system it has been shown,[1] even in the partially entangled case,
that if there are M copies of the state available, by making only local operations A can
produce M ′ < M states which are maximally entangled. The optimal conversion ratio
M ′ /M is given, for large M, by SA .[28]
     Although there are other measures of entanglement,[2] the entropy is most readily suited
to analytic investigation. In several papers[3, 4, 5, 6], the concept has been applied to
quantum spin chains. Typically, the subset A consists of a commuting set of components
of the spin degrees of freedom in some interval of length ℓ, in an infinitely long chain. It is
found that the entanglement entropy generally tends to a finite value as ℓ increases, but that
this value diverges as the system approaches a quantum critical point. At such a critical
point, the entropy grows proportional to log ℓ for large ℓ.
     Close to a quantum critical point, where the correlation length ξ is much larger than the
lattice spacing a, the low-lying excitations and the long-distance behaviour of the correlations
in the ground state of a quantum spin chain are believed to be described by a quantum field
theory in 1+1 dimensions. If the dispersion relation of the low-lying excitations is linear
for wave numbers k such that ξ −1 ≪ |k| ≪ a−1 , the field theory is relativistic. We shall
consider only those cases in this paper. At the critical point, where ξ −1 = 0, the field theory


                                              2
is massless, and is a conformal field theory (CFT).
   In this case, the von Neumann entropy of subsystem corresponding to an interval of
length ℓ was calculated some time ago by Holzhey et al.[7], in the context of black hole
physics (although that connection has been questioned), where it was termed ‘geometric’
entropy. Using methods of conformal field theory, based in part on earlier work of Cardy
and Peschel[8], they found SA ∼ (c/3) log(ℓ/a), where c is the conformal anomaly number
(sometimes called the central charge) of the corresponding CFT.
   This result has been verified by analytic and numerical calculations on integrable quantum
spin chains corresponding to CFTs with c = 12 and c = 1. [3, 4, 5]
   In this paper, we first put the CFT arguments of Holzhey et al.[7] on a more systematic
basis, and generalise their result in a number of ways. Our methods are based on a formula
for the entropy in terms of the partition function in the path integral formulation of the
quantum theory as a euclidean field theory on an n-sheeted Riemann surface, in the limit
n → 1.
   For a 1+1-dimensional theory at a critical point, we derive analogous formulas for the
entropy in the cases when the subsystem A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint
intervals of the real line (see Eq. 41), and when the whole system has itself a finite length
L. For example, for the case when A is a single interval of length ℓ, and periodic boundary
conditions are imposed on the whole system, we find

                           SA = (c/3) log ((L/πa) sin(πℓ/L)) + c′1 .                      (1)

On the other hand, for a finite system of total length L with open boundaries, divided at
some interior point into an interval A of length ℓ and its complement, we find

                        SA = (c/6) log ((L/πa) sin(πℓ/L)) + 2g + c′1 ,                    (2)

where g is the boundary entropy of Affleck and Ludwig[9]. We also treat the case when the
system is infinitely long but is in a thermal mixed state at finite temperature β −1 :

                          SA = (c/3) log ((β/πa) sinh(πℓ/β)) + c′1 .                      (3)

In all these cases, the constant c′1 is the same, but non-universal.
   For a massive 1+1-dimensional relativistic QFT (which corresponds to an off-critical
quantum spin chain where the correlation length ξ ≫ a) the simplest results are for an

                                             3
infinite system divided at some point into two semi-infinite pieces. In this case we verify
that the entanglement entropy is finite, and derive the universal formula

                                     SA ∼ (c/6) log(ξ/a) .                                    (4)

In the more general case when A consists of a collection of disjoint intervals, each of length
≫ ξ, we expect (4) to be multiplied by a factor A which counts the number of boundary
points between A and B (the 1d analogue of surface area.)
   For A = 1 the entropy is exactly calculable in the case of a free field theory. We verify
the above formula, and exhibit the finite-size cross-over which occurs when ξ is of the size
L of the system. For a lattice model in this geometry, with L infinite, we point out that ρA
is simply related to Baxter’s corner transfer matrix, and thus, for integrable models whose
weights satisfy a Yang-Baxter relation, all its eigenvalues can be determined exactly. We
treat explicitly the case of the Ising model and its anisotropic limit, the transverse Ising
spin chain, and also the XXZ model, computing exactly at all values of the coupling the
finite part of the entropy S. This agrees with our continuum result (4) for c = 21 , 1 when
the correlation length ξ is large.
   The analysis for the free theory is straightforward to extend to higher dimensions, at least
in suitable geometries. This leads to the well-known law, first found by Srednicki[10], that
the entropy should be proportional to the surface area A of the subsystem A. As pointed
out by Srednicki, the coefficient of this term, for d > 1, depends on the UV cut-off and is
therefore non-universal. However, based on our calculations, we propose that there should
be a non-leading piece in SA /A, proportional to ξ −(d−1) , which depends in a singular way
on the couplings near a quantum phase transition, and whose form is, moreover, universal.
   The layout of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we discuss the entropy in terms
of the euclidean path integral on an n-sheeted Riemann surface. In Sec. III we consider
the 1+1-dimensional conformal case. We use the powerful methods of CFT to show that
the partition function on the Riemann surface of interest is given, up to a constant, by a
calculable correlation function of vertex operators in a c = 1 CFT in the complex plane.
Similar results apply to a system with boundaries. This general result allows us to derive
all the special cases described above. In Sec. IV we consider the case of a massive 1+1-
dimensional field theory. We derive the result S ∼ (c/6) log(ξ/a) from completely general
properties of the stress tensor in the relevant geometry. This is then verified for a free bosonic

                                               4
massive field. In the last part of this section we relate the lattice version of this problem to
the corner transfer matrix, and compute the off-critical entropy for the case of the Ising and
XXZ Heisenberg spin chains. In Sec. V we study the off-critical case in a finite-size system,
propose a scaling law, and verify it for the case of a free massive field theory. We compute
the relevant scaling function in a systematic sequence of approximations. Sec. VI is devoted
to the discussion of higher dimensions.
      While all this work was being carried out, some other related papers have appeared
in the literature. In Ref. [11], the result SA ∼ (c/3) log(ℓ/a), first found by Holzhey et
al.[7], was obtained by the following argument: it was assumed that the entropy should be
conformally invariant and therefore some function F (x) of the variable x = (β/π) sinh(πℓ/β);
by comparing with known case ℓ ≫ β [12, 13] it was observed that F (x) should behave as
(c/3) log x as x → ∞; finally it was assumed (with no justification being given) that the
log x form for F is valid for all values of x; finally the limit β ≫ ℓ was taken. In the present
paper, we should stress, we have derived all these statements from first principles of CFT.
      Very recently Casini and Huerta[6] have considered the case of two intervals A and B,
and argued that the quantity F (A, B) ≡ S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∩ B) − S(A ∪ B) is UV
finite as a → 0, and is given by a universal logarithmic function of the cross-ratio of the
four end points. This corresponds to, and agrees with, our case N = 2. These authors,
however, assume the conformal invariance of the entropy, while, once again, we stress that
in the present paper we derive this from fundamental properties of the stress tensor. These
authors also give a very nice alternative derivation of Zamolodchikov’s c-theorem[14] based
on this quantity F (A, B).


II.     VON NEUMANN ENTROPY AND RIEMANN SURFACES.


      Consider a lattice quantum theory in one space and one time dimension, initially on the
infinite line. The lattice spacing is a, and the lattice sites are labelled by a discrete variable
x. The domain of x can be finite, i.e. some interval of length L, semi-infinite, or infinite.
Time is considered to be continuous. A complete set of local commuting observables will
be denoted by {φ̂(x)}, and their eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates by {φ(x)} and
⊗x |{φ(x)}i respectively. For a bosonic lattice field theory, these will be the fundamental
bosonic fields of the theory; for a spin model some particular component of the local spin.


                                               5
The dynamics of the theory is described by a time-evolution operator Ĥ. The density matrix
ρ in a thermal state at inverse temperature β is

                  ρ({φ(x′′ )′′ }|{φ(x′ )′ }) = Z(β)−1 h{φ(x′′ )′′ }|e−β Ĥ |{φ(x′ )′ }i ,                    (5)

where Z(β) = Tr e−β Ĥ is the partition function.
   This may be expressed in the standard way as a (euclidean) path integral:
                       Z
                  −1
                                                δ(φ(x, 0) − φ(x′ )′ )       δ(φ(x, β) − φ(x′′ )′′ ) e−SE ,
                                           Y                            Y
           ρ=Z             [dφ(x, τ )]                                                                       (6)
                                            x                           x
             Rβ
where SE =    0 LE dτ , with LE the euclidean lagrangian.                       (For a spin model this would be
replaced by a coherent state path integral.)
   The normalisation factor of the partition function ensures that Tr ρ = 1, and is found by
setting {φ(x)′′ } = {φ(x)′ } and integrating over these variables. This has the effect of sewing
together the edges along τ = 0 and τ = β to form a cylinder of circumference β.
   Now let A be a subsystem consisting of the points x in the disjoint[29] intervals
(u1 , v1 ), . . . , (uN , vN ). An expression for the the reduced density matrix ρA may be found
from (6) by sewing together only those points x which are not in A. This will have the effect
of leaving open cuts, one for each interval (uj , vj ), along the the line τ = 0.
   We may then compute Tr ρnA , for any positive integer n, by making n copies of the above,
labelled by an integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and sewing them together cyclically along the the
cuts so that φ(x)′k = φ(x)′′k+1 (and φ(x)′n = φ(x)′′1 ) for all x ∈ A. Let us denote the path
integral on this n-sheeted structure by Zn (A). Then

                                                                Zn (A)
                                                    Tr ρnA =           .                                     (7)
                                                                 Zn
                                      n
   Now, since Tr ρnA =           λλ       , where λ are the eigenvalues of ρA (which lie in [0, 1),) and
                             P

since Tr ρA = 1, it follows that the left hand side is absolutely convergent and therefore
analytic for all Re n > 1. The derivative wrt n therefore also exists and is analytic in the
region. Moreover, if the entropy ρA = −                    λ λ log λ is finite, the limit as n → 1+ of the first
                                                       P

derivative converges to this value.
   We conclude that the right hand side of (7) has a unique analytic continuation to Re n > 1
and that its first derivative at n = 1 gives the required entropy:

                                                              ∂ Zn (A)
                                                SA = − lim             .                                     (8)
                                                         n→1 ∂n Z n


                                                            6
(Note that even before taking this limit, (7) gives an expression for the Tsallis entropy[15]
(Tr ρnA − 1)/(1 − n).)
   So far, everything has been in the discrete space domain. We now discuss the continuum
limit, in which a → 0 keeping all other lengths fixed. The points x then assume real values,
and the path integral is over fields φ(x, τ ) on an n-sheeted Riemann surface, with branch
points at uj and vj . In this limit, SE is supposed to go over into the euclidean action for a
quantum field theory. We shall restrict attention to the case when this is Lorentz invariant,
since the full power of relativistic field theory can then be brought to bear. The behaviour
of partition functions in this limit has been well studied. In two dimensions, the logarithm
of a general partition function Z in a domain with total area A and with boundaries of total
length L behaves as
                               log Z = f1 Aa−2 + f2 La−1 + . . .                           (9)

where f1 and f2 are the non-universal bulk and boundary free energies. Note, however, that
these leading terms cancel in the ratio of partition functions in (7). However, as was argued
by Cardy and Peschel[8] there are also universal terms proportional to log a. These arise
from points of non-zero curvature of the manifold and its boundary. In our case, these are
conical singularities at the branch points. In fact, as we shall show, it is precisely these
logarithmic terms which give rise to the non-trivial dependence of the final result for the
entropy on the short-distance cut-off a. For the moment let us simply remark that, in order
to achieve a finite limit as a → 0, the right hand side of (7) should be multiplied by some
renormalisation constant Z(A, n). Its dependence on a will emerge from the later analysis.


III.   ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY IN 2D CONFORMAL FIELD THEORY.


   Now specialise the discussion of the previous section to the case when the field theory
is relativistic and massless, i.e. a conformal field theory (CFT), with central charge c, and
initially consider the case of zero temperature.
   We show that in this case the ratio of partition functions in (7) is the same as the corre-
lation function arising from the insertion of primary scaling operators Φn (uj ) and Φ−n (vj ),
with scaling dimensions Xn = 2∆n = (c/12)(1 − 1/n2 ), into each of the n (disconnected)
sheets. Moreover, this 2N-point correlation function is computable from the Ward identities
of CFT.

                                             7
   In the language of string theory, the objects we consider are correlators of orbifold points
in theories whose target space consists of n copies of the given CFT. We expect that some
of our results may therefore have appeared in the literature of the subject.


   A.     Single interval


   We first consider the case N = 1 and no boundaries, that is the case considered by
Holzhey et al.[7] of a single interval of length ℓ in an infinitely long 1d quantum system, at
zero temperature. The conformal mapping w → ζ = (w −u)/(w −v) maps the branch points
to (0, ∞). This is then uniformised by the mapping ζ → z = ζ 1/n = ((w − u)/(w − v))1/n .
This maps the whole of the n-sheeted Riemann surface Rn to the z-plane C. Now consider
the holomorphic component of the stress tensor T (w). This is related to the transformed
stress tensor T (z) by[16]

                               T (w) = (dz/dw)2 T (z) + 12
                                                         c
                                                           {z, w} ,                             (10)

where {z, w} is the Schwartzian derivative (z ′′′ z ′ − 23 z ′′ 2 )/z ′ 2 . In particular, taking the
expectation value of this, and using hT (z)iC = 0 by translational and rotational invariance,
we find
                              c          c(1 − (1/n)2 )     (v − u)2
                   hT (w)iRn =  {z, w} =                                  .           (11)
                             12               24        (w − u)2 (w − v)2
This is to be compared with the standard form[16] of the correlator of T with two primary
operators Φn (u) and Φ−n (v) which have the same complex scaling dimensions ∆n = ∆n =
(c/24)(1 − (1/n)2 ):
                                                              ∆n

where Φ±n are normalised so that hΦn (u)Φ−n (v)iC = |v − u|−2∆n −2∆n . (12) is equivalent to
the conformal Ward identity[16]
                                                                                !

In writing the above, we are assuming that w is a complex coordinate on a single sheet C,
which is now decoupled from the others. We have therefore shown that
                                     [dφ]T (w)e−SE (Rn )
                                 R

                                                  8
Now consider the effect of an infinitesimal conformal transformation w → w ′ = w + α(w) of
C which act identically on all the sheets of Rn . The effect of this is to insert a factor
                             1                                 1
                                  Z                                 Z
                                       α(w)T (w)dw −                     α(w)T (w̄)dw̄                     (15)
                            2πi    C                          2πi    C

into the path integral, where the contour C encircles the points u and v. The insertion of
T (w) is given by (12). Since this is to be inserted on each sheet, the right hand side gets
multiplied by a factor n.
   Since the Ward identity (13) determines all the properties under conformal transforma-
tions, we conclude that the renormalised Zn (A)/Z n ∝ Tr ρnA behaves (apart from a possible
overall constant) under scale and conformal transformations identically to the nth power
of two-point function of a primary operator Φn with ∆n = ∆n = (c/24)(1 − (1/n)2 ). In
particular, this means that

                                  Tr ρnA = cn ((v − u)/a)−(c/6)(n−1/n) ,                                   (16)

where the exponent is just 4n∆n . The power of a (corresponding to the renormalisation
constant Z) has been inserted so as the make the final result dimensionless, as it should
be. The constants cn are not determined by this method. However c1 must be unity.
Differentiating with respect to n and setting n = 1, we recover the result of Holzhey et al.
   The fact that Tr ρnA transforms under a general conformal transformation as a 2-point
function of primary operators Φ±n means that it is simple to compute in other geometries,
obtained by a conformal mapping z → z ′ = w(z), using the formula[16]

                                                       |w ′ (zj )|2∆n hΦ(w1 , w̄1 )Φ(w2 , w̄2 ) . . .i .
                                                   Y
              hΦ(z1 , z̄1 )Φ(z2 , z̄2 ) . . .i =                                                           (17)
                                                   j

   For example, the transformation w → w ′ = (β/2π) log w maps each sheet in the w-plane
into an infinitely long cylinder of circumference β. The sheets are now sewn together along
a branch cut joining the images of the points u and v. By arranging this to lie parallel to
the axis of the cylinder, we get an expression for Tr ρnA in a thermal mixed state at finite
temperature β −1 . This leads to the result for the entropy

                           SA (β) ∼ (c/3) log ((β/πa) sinh(πℓ/β)) + c′1 .                                  (18)

For ℓ ≪ β we find SA ∼ (c/3) log(ℓ/a) as before, while, in the opposite limit ℓ ≫ β,
SA ∼ (πc/3)(ℓ/β). In this limit, the von Neumann entropy is extensive, and its density

                                                          9
agrees with that of the Gibbs entropy of an isolated system of length ℓ, as obtained from
the standard CFT expression[12, 13] βF ∼ −(πc/6)(ℓ/β) for its free energy.
   Alternatively, we may orient the branch cut perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder,
which, with the replacement β → L, corresponds to the entropy of a subsystem of length
ℓ in a finite 1d system of length L, with periodic boundary conditions, in its ground state.
This gives
                            SA ∼ (c/3) log ((L/πa) sin(πℓ/L)) + c′1 .                      (19)

Note that this expression is symmetric under ℓ → L − ℓ. It is maximal when ℓ = L/2.


   B.   Finite system with a boundary.


   Next consider the case when the 1d system is a semi-infinite line, say [0, ∞), and the
subsystem A is the finite interval [0, ℓ). The n-sheeted Riemann surface then consists of
n copies of the half-plane x ≥ 0, sewn together along 0 ≤ x < ℓ, τ = 0. Once again, we
work initially at zero temperature. It is convenient to use the complex variable w = τ + ix.
The uniformising transformation is now z = ((w − iℓ)/(w + iℓ))1/n , which maps the whole
Riemann surface to the unit disc |z| ≤ 1. In this geometry, hT (z)i = 0 by rotational
invariance, so that, using (10), we find
                                                   ∆n (2ℓ)2
                                hT (w)iRn =                        ,                       (20)
                                               (w − iℓ)2 (w + iℓ)2
where ∆n = (c/24)(1 − n−2 ) as before. Note that in the half-plane, T and T are related by
analytic continuation: T (w̄) = T (w)∗. (20) has the same form as hT (w)Φn (iℓ)i, which follows
from the Ward identities of boundary CFT[17], with the normalisation hΦn (iℓ)i = (2ℓ)−∆n .
   The analysis then proceeds in analogy with the previous case. We find

                                  Tr ρnA ∼ c̃n (2ℓ/a)(c/12)(n−1/n) ,                       (21)

so that SA ∼ (c/6) log(2ℓ/a) + c̃′1 .
   Once again, this result can be conformally transformed into a number of other cases. At
finite temperature β −1 we find

                         SA (β) ∼ (c/6) log ((β/πa) sinh(2πℓ/β)) + c̃′1 .                  (22)

By taking the limit when ℓ ≫ β we find the same extensive entropy as before. However, we
can now identify c̃′1 − c′1 as the boundary entropy g, first discussed by Affleck and Ludwig[9].

                                                10
   For a completely finite 1d system, of length L, at zero temperature, divided into two
pieces of lengths ℓ and L − ℓ, we similarly find

                                  SA = (c/6) log ((L/πa) sin(πℓ/L)) + 2g + c′1 .                                   (23)


   C.   General case.


   For general N, the algebra is more complicated, but the method is the same. The
                                                                                 αi
uniformising transformation now has the form z =                   i (w − wi )        , with       i αi = 0 (so there is
                                                                  Q                            P

no singularity at infinity.) Here wi can be uj , vj , or ±iuj in the case of a boundary. In our
case, we have αi = ±1/n, but it is interesting to consider the more general transformation,
and the notation is simpler. Once again we have
                                                                                 2

                                      hT (w)i = {z, w} =                        .                                  (24)

Consider {z, w}/z. As a function of w, this is meromorphic, has a double pole at each
w = wi , and is O(w −2) as w → ∞. Hence it has the form
                                                  X       Ai        X Bi

from which we find after a little more algebra that

This is to be compared with the conformal Ward identity
                                                     "                                       #

For these to be equivalent, we must have ∆i = 21 (1 − αi2 ) and

The overall constant is fixed in terms of the previously defined cn by taking the intervals to

   Differentiating with respect to n and setting n = 1, we find our main result of this section
                                                                                           

   A similar expression holds in the case of a boundary, with half of the wi corresponding
to the image points.
   Finally we comment on the recent result of Casini and Huerta[6], which corresponds to
N = 2. In fact, it may be generalised to the ratio of Tsallis entropies: from (40) we find
                                                                        !(c/6)(n−1/n)

                  Sn (A ∩ B)Sn (A ∪ B)           (u2 − u1 )(v2 − v1 )

where Sn (A) ≡ Tr ρnA , and the expression in parentheses is the cross-ratio η of the four points.
Notice that in this expression the dependence on the ultraviolet cut-off a disappeared, so
have the non-universal numbers cn . Differentiating with respect to n gives the result of
Casini and Huerta[6], who however assumed that the result should depend only on η.


IV.     ENTROPY IN NON-CRITICAL 1+1-DIMENSIONAL MODELS


   A.    Massive field theory - general case


   In this section we consider an infinite non-critical model in 1+1-dimensions, in the scaling
limit where the lattice spacing a → 0 with the correlation length (inverse mass) fixed. This
corresponds to a massive relativistic QFT. We first consider the case when the subset A
is the negative real axis, so that the appropriate Riemann surface has branch points of
order n at 0 and infinity. However, for the non-critical case, the branch point at infinity is
unimportant: we should arrive at the same expression by considering a finite system whose
length L is much greater than ξ.
   Our argument parallels that of Zamolodchikov[14] for the proof of his famous c-theorem.
Let us consider the expectation value of the stress tensor Tµν of a massive euclidean QFT

                                                 13
on such a Riemann surface. In complex coordinates, there are three non-zero components:
T ≡ Tzz , T ≡ Tz̄ z̄ , and the trace Θ = 4Tz z̄ = 4Tz̄z . These are related by the conservation
equations

                                         ∂z̄ T + 14 ∂z Θ = 0 ;                            (43)
                                         ∂z T + 14 ∂z̄ Θ = 0 .                            (44)

   Consider the expectation values of these components. In the single-sheeted geometry,
hT i and hT i both vanish, but hΘi is constant and non-vanishing: it measures the explicit
breaking of scale invariance in the non-critical system. In the n-sheeted geometry, however,
they all acquire a non-trivial spatial dependence. By rotational invariance about the origin,
they have the form

                                         hT (z, z̄)i = Fn (zz̄)/z 2 ;                     (45)

                                hΘ(z, z̄)i − hΘi1 = Gn (zz̄)/(zz̄) ;                      (46)
                                         hT (z, z̄)i = Fn (zz̄)/z̄ 2 .                    (47)

From the conservation conditions (43) we have
                                                       
                                    (zz̄) Fn′ + 14 G′n = 41 Gn .                          (48)

Now we expect that Fn and Gn both approach zero exponentially fast for |z| ≫ ξ, while
in the opposite limit, on distance scales ≪ ξ, they approach the CFT values (see previous
section) Fn → (c/24)(1 − n−2 ), Gn → 0.
   This means that if we define an effective C-function
                                                                  
                                 Cn (R2 ) ≡ F (R2 ) + 41 G(R2 ) ,                         (49)

then
                                         ∂
                                  R2          Cn (R2 ) = 41 Gn (R2 ) .                    (50)
                                       ∂(R2 )
   If we were able to argue that Gn ≤ 0, that is hΘin ≤ hΘi1 , we would have found
alternative formulation of the c-theorem. However, we can still derive an integrated form of
the c-theorem, using the boundary conditions:[30]

                                  Gn (R2 )
                           Z ∞
                                      2
                                           d(R2 ) = −(c/6)(1 − n−2 ) ,                    (51)
                            0       R

                                                   14
or equivalently
                            Z
                                (hΘin − hΘi1) d2R = −πn(c/6)(1 − n−2 ) ,                     (52)

where the integral is over the whole of the the n-sheeted surface. Now this integral (multi-
plied by a factor 1/2π corresponding to the conventional normalisation of the stress tensor)
measures the response of the free energy − log Z to a scale transformation, i.e. to a change
in the mass m, since this is the only dimensionful parameter of the renormalised theory.
Thus the left hand side is equal to

                                 − (2π) m(∂/∂m) [log Zn − n log Z] ,                         (53)

giving finally
                                      Zn
                                        n
                                          = cn (ma)(c/12)(n−1/n) ,                           (54)
                                      Z
where cn is a constant (with however c1 = 1), and we have inserted a power of a, correspond-
ing to the renormalisation constant Z discussed earlier, to make the result dimensionless.
   This shows that the (n − 1/n) dependence for the exponent of the Tsallis entropy is a
general property of the continuum theory. Differentiating at n = 1, we find the main result
of this section
                                SA ∼ −(c/6) log(ma) = (c/6) log(ξ/a) ,                       (55)

where ξ is the correlation length. We re-emphasise that this result was obtained only for the
scaling limit ξ ≫ a. However, for lattice integrable models, we shall show how it is possible
to obtain the full dependence without this restriction.
   So far we have considered the simplest geometry in the which set A and its complement B
are semi-infinite intervals. The more general case, when A is a union of disjoint intervals, is
more difficult in the massive case. However it is still true that the entropy can be expressed
in terms of the derivative at n = 1 of correlators of operators Φn . The above calculation can
be thought of in terms of the one-point function hΦn i. In any quantum field theory a more
                       Qk
general correlator h    i=1 Φ±n (wi )i should obey cluster decomposition: that is, for separations

|wi − wj | all ≫ ξ, it should approach hΦn ik . This suggests that, in this limit, the entropy
should behave as SA ∼ A(c/6) log(ξ/a), where A = k is the number of boundary points
between A and its complement. This would be the 1d version of the area law[10]. When the
interval lengths are of the order of ξ, we expect to see a complicated but universal scaling
form for the cross-over.

                                                 15
   B.   Free bosonic field theory


   In this subsection we verify Eq. (55) by an explicit calculation for a massive free field
theory (Gaussian model.) The action
                                              Z                            

is, as before, considered on a n-sheeted Riemann surface with one cut, which we arbitrarily
fix on the real negative axis.
   To obtain the entanglement entropy we should know the ratio Zn /Z n , where Zn is the
partition function in the n-sheeted geometry. There are several equivalent ways to calculate
such partition function. In the following, we find easier to use the identity[31]
                                     ∂
                                                                  Z
                                       2
                                         log Zn = − 12                Gn (r, r)d2r ,              (57)
                                    ∂m
where Gn (r, r′ ) is the two-point correlation function in the n-sheeted geometry. Thus we
need the combination Gn − nG1 . Gn obeys

                                   (−∇2r + m2 )Gn (r, r′) = δ 2 (r − r′ ) .                       (58)

Its solution (see the Appendix) may be expressed in polar coordinates as (here 0 < r, r ′ < ∞
and 0 ≤ θ, θ′ < 2πn)
                                              ∞

                Gn (r, θ, r ′ , θ′ ) =           dk     λdλ                       Ck (θ, θ′ ) ,   (59)

where Ck (θ, θ′ ) = cos(kθ/n) cos(kθ′ /n) + sin(kθ/n) sin(kθ′ /n), d0 = 1, dk>0 = 2, and Jk (x)
are the Bessel functions of the first kind. At coincident points (i.e. r = r ′ , θ = θ′ ), and after
integrating over θ and λ we have
                                                            ∞

where Ik (x) and Kk (x) are the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind respec-
tively [18].
   The sum over k in (60) is UV divergent. This reflects the usual short-distance divergence
which would occur even in the plane. However, if we formally exchange the order of the sum
and integration we find

Interpreting the last sum as 2ζ(−1) = −1/6, we obtain the correct result, which we now
derive more systematically.
   Let us first regularise each sum over k by inserting a function F (k/Λn ): F is chosen so
that F (0) = 1, and all its derivatives at the origin vanish: however it goes to zero sufficiently
fast at infinity. Since k/n is conjugate to the angle θ, we should think of this cut-off as being
equivalent to a discretisation δθ. Thus we should choose Λn = Λ · n, where Λ ∼ (δθ)−1 .
   To perform the sum over k, we use the Euler-MacLaurin (EML) sum formula [18]
                       ∞                                    ∞

where B2n are the Bernoulli numbers [18]. Using standard identities of the Bessel function
(namely ∂k Kk (x)|k=0 = 0 and ∂k Ik (x)|k=0 = −K0 (k) [18]), we obtain

                                                 1            ∞            B2j

where we define Di (x) = ∂ i (Ik (x)Kk (x))/∂k i |k=0. In the last term in Eq. (63) the order of
the integral, derivative, and sum can be exchanged and each term in the sum is

                    ∂i                                 ∂i k
                           Z ∞
                                 xdxIk (x)Kk (x) = −          = 0 for i = 2j + 1 ≥ 2 ,       (64)
                    ∂k i   0                           ∂k i 2

i.e. the sum in Eq. (63) is vanishing.
   Thus, still with the regulator in place,

               ∂                ∞       ∞                                   1

                  log Z n = −     rdr     dkIk/n (mr)K k/n (mr)F (k/nΛ) −                    (65)

                           R∞
where we have used         0     rK02 (mr)dr = 1/(2m2 ).
   Now the point is that in the integral over k the factor of n can be scaled out by letting
k → nk. Thus this potentially divergent term cancels in the required combination Gn −nG1 .
Having taken this combination, we may now remove the regulator to find the main result

                                          ∂ log Zn     1      1
                                                                     
                                                   =      n −             .                  (66)
                                         ∂m2 Z n     24m2     n

The integration of the last expression wrt m2 (made following the recipe for the integration
limits given in the previous section) gives

that agrees with the general formula we derive (55), with c = 1 and m = ξ −1 .


   C.   Integrable models and the corner transfer matrix


   In this subsection we verify (55) for the transverse Ising chain and the uniaxial XXZ
Heisenberg model. These results are also an independent check of the uniform convergence
of the derivative wrt n of ρn when n → 1, since for these models we can compute the
eigenvalues of ρA exactly.
   Although these systems are integrable and their ground state is known, a direct calcula-
tion of ρ is difficult. The difficulties arising in a direct calculation can be avoided mapping
the quantum chains onto two-dimensional classical spin systems. As firstly pointed out by
Nishino et al. [19] the density matrix of the quantum chain is the partition function of a
two-dimensional strip with a cut perpendicular to it. In fact the ground state of a quantum
chain described by an Hamiltonian H is also eigenstate of the transfer matrix T of a classical
systems satisfying [H, T ] = 0. Therefore the reduced density matrix of a subsystem A of
the chain (defined in the Introduction as ρA = TrB |ΨihΨ|, with B the complement of A) is
the partition function of two half-infinite strips, one extending from −∞ to 0 and the other
from +∞ to 0, with the spins in B identified.
   This partition function is the product of four Baxter corner transfer matrices (CTMs)[20]
Â. If the lattice is choose in a clever way (i.e. rotated by π/4 with respect to the cut) one
ends in the infinite length limit with [21]

                                       ρ̂A = Â4 = e−ĤCTM ,                               (69)

where ĤCTM is an effective Hamiltonian, which, for the models under consideration, may be
diagonalised by means of fermionisation (see for more details about this equivalence [21] and
references therein.) Note that Trρ̂A 6= 1, thus the usual density matrix is ρA = ρ̂A /Trρ̂A .
   The method just outlined is very general. However, for the integrable chains under
consideration (and indeed for any model satisfying suitable Yang-Baxter equations[20]) it is
possible to write HCTM = ǫÔ, with ǫ the scale giving the distance between the energy levels,

                                               18
and Ô is an operator with integer eigenvalues (for the Ising and XXZ models it is expressed
in terms of free fermions.) Using this property the entropy is given by[32]
                                           ρ̂A log ρ̂A                  ∂ log Z
            S = −TrρA log ρA = −Tr                     + log Trρ̂A = −ǫ         + log Z ,    (70)
                                              Trρ̂A                        ∂ǫ
where we defined Z = Trρ̂A = Tre−ĤCTM .
   The Ising model in a transverse field can be described by the one-dimensional Hamiltonian
                                               L−1               L−1

                                                                            z
                                               X                 X
                                      HI = −                                    ,            (71)
                                               n=1               n=1

where σn are the Pauli matrices at the site n, and we normalise the Hamiltonian (following
[21]) by imposing the transverse field in the x direction to be one, thus the transition is
driven by the parameter λ. The classical equivalent of (71) is two dimensional Ising model.
For λ = 0 the ground state of the Hamiltonian (71) is a quantum “paramagnet” with all
the spins aligned with the magnetic field in the x direction, and hσnz i = 0. In the opposite
limit λ = ∞ the magnetic field is negligible and the ground state is ferromagnetic with
hσnz i = ±1. The (second-order) transition between this two regimes happens at λ = 1. The
exponent characterizing the divergence of the correlation length is ν = 1, i.e. ξ ≃ |λ − 1|−1.
   The CTM of the Ising model may be diagonalised in terms of fermionic operators. The
CTM Hamiltonian, written in terms of the fermion occupation number n̂i (with eigenvalues
0 and 1) is [21]

FIG. 1: Entanglement entropy for the 1D Ising chain as function of λ. The dashed line is the limit
for λ → ∞, i.e. log 2.

Fig. 1 shows a plot of the entropy as function of λ, characterised by a divergence at the
quantum critical point λ = 1. Note that S(0) = 0 and S(∞) = log 2, in agreement with the
expectation that the pure ferromagnetic ground state (λ = ∞) has two possible accessible
configurations with opposite sign of magnetisation (i.e. S(∞) = log 2) and the pure quantum
paramagnetic ground state (λ = 0) has only one configuration available with all the spins
aligned in the direction of the magnetic field x and the resulting entropy is zero.
   Let us analyze in details the behaviour at the critical point. For λ → 1, ǫ → 0 in both
the phases, thus the sums Eqs. (75) and (76) can be approximated by the integral

for ∆ > 1 (whose classical equivalent is the Baxter six-vertex model [20].) This model has
an Ising-like ferromagnetic state for ∆ > 1 and a planar XX ferromagnetic ground state at
0 < ∆ < 1 (the case ∆ < 0 describes the antiferromagnetic regime, in which we are not
interested.) At ∆ = 1 the Hamiltonian is isotropic (XXX) and approaching such a point
from large ∆ values the correlation length diverges as (see e.g. [20])

                                           ξ     π2

because at ∆ = 1 a massless excitation (Goldstone mode) is present in the spectrum.
     The CTM Hamiltonian ĤCTM for this model has been obtained in Ref. [21]

Using Eq. (80) to write ∆ in term of the correlation length, we have

                                           S≃     log ,                                  (83)

in agreement with 55, with c = 1. Again, in the limit ∆ → ∞, S = log 2, since the
ferromagnetic ground state is Ising-like.
     The method used here for the transverse Ising model and the XXZ model can in principle
be applied to all those integrable model whose weights satisfy Yang-Baxter equations.


V.     FINITE-SIZE EFFECTS


     So far, we have studied the entropy either at the critical point, for a finite subsystem,
or away from criticality in an infinite system. These two regimes may be linked by a
generalisation of finite-size scaling theory. This would assert, for example, that the entropy
of a subsystem A which forms e.g. the left half of a finite non-critical system of length 2L
should have the form
                                            c
                              SA (L, ξ) =     (log L + sFSS (L/ξ)) ,                     (84)

                                                21
with sFSS (0) = 0 (this because we are referring to the scaling part, the constant term
found before is not universal and it defines an overall additive normalisation of S) and
sFSS (x) ∼ − log x, for large x, so as to recover S = (c/6) log ξ in the infinite length limit.
sFSS (x) should admit a small x expansion

                                                          sj x2j ,

with sj universal coefficients, and a large x expansion

                                                                j
                                 sFSS (x) = − log x +             j
                                                                      ,                   (86)

with s∞
      j also universal (in special situations logarithmic corrections could also be generated.)

In the next section we test this hypothesis for the free massive field theory.


   A.   FSS in the Gaussian model


   Once again we consider the n-sheeted surface, but it now consists of n discs of finite
radius L, sewn together along the negative real axis from −L to 0. The Gaussian two-point
function in a finite geometry has been calculated in the Appendix Eq. (A2). Setting θ = θ′ ,
r = r ′ and integrating over θ′ the propagator at coincident point is
                                                            2
                                ∞
                                X     ∞
                                      X       2/L2         Jk/n (αk/n,ir/L)
                      Gn (r) =     dk      2                2       2     2
                                                                            ,             (87)
                               k=0    i=1 Jk/n+1 (αk/n,i ) αk/n,i /L + m

where αν,i denotes the i−th zero of Jν (x). G(r) is the analogous of (60) in a finite geometry.
   As we showed in the previous section, the right order to proceed to get a sensitive Zn is
first to perform the sum over i, then sum over k and finally integrate over r. This is really
hard, requiring a sum of Bessel functions for generic argument, over the zeroes of different
Bessel functions. What one can do is inverting the order of the sums and integrations and
try to understand what happens. From the previous exercise we know that this operation
has to be done with care.
   However, the formal result is
                                                  2
                                     1X X        αk/n,i /L2 + m2
                            log Zn =     dk   log 2               .                       (88)
                                     2 k    i    αk/n,i /L2 + a−2

Since the large i behaviour of the zeroes of the Bessel functions is αν,i ∼ π(i + ν/2 − 1/4)
(see e.g. [18]), this sum diverges.

                                               22
   A first, qualitatively correct expression for the universal function sFSS (x) can be obtained
from Eq. (88), truncating the EML formula Eq. (62) in the variable k at the first order
in the derivative. This approximation gives a correct form of the result because it takes
into account the complete infinite volume result (whose truncated expression is exact.) The
integral term in the EML is divergent, but it cancels as before in the ratio Zn /Z n if the
cut-off in the angular modes is properly chosen as in the infinite volume case. The EML
approximation at the first order is (we do not write the integral)
               πL2 (a−2 − m2 ) X            α0,i             Y0 (α0,i )   F1 (mL, L/a)

                                                                        ≡              ,            (89)
                     12n       i (α0,i + m L )(α0,i + L /a ) J1 (α0,i )        n
where we used
                                        ∂αk,i     π Y0 (α0,i )
                                                =              ,                                    (90)
                                         ∂k k=0   2 J1 (α0,i )
which can be derived using the formulas [18] of the derivative of the Bessel functions with
respect to the order. The remaining sum over i (the zeroes of the Bessel function) is now
finite.
   This gives the entropy as
                                         ∂
                                S=−        Trρn     = 2F1 (mL, L/a) ,                               (91)
                                        ∂n      n=1
which reproduces the correct limits for m = 0 and L = ∞.
   From this formula we may compare with the FSS ansatz (84), with c = 1:
      (1)                                                  X Y0 (α0,i )           m2 L2
     sFSS (mL) = 12(F1 (mL, L/a) − F1 (0, L/a)) = −π                              2
                                                                                                ,   (92)
                                                            i   J1 (α0,i ) α0,i (α0,i + m2 L2 )
that, as expected, is a function only of the product mL and all the dependence upon a
disappears after the subtraction. This agrees with sFSS (0) = 0 and sFSS (0) = − log x, for
large x (it can be easily shown, since in this limit the sum can be replaced by an integral.)
The over-script (1) is there to remind that we made a first-order approximation in EML.
   Eq.      (92) characterises completely the crossover between the mass dominated (non-
critical) and the geometry dominated (critical) regime.
                (1)
   A plot of sFSS is shown in Fig. 2 (calculated as the sum of the first 1000 zeroes of J0 .)
                                                                                   (1)
From this figure we see that an optimum approximation for x ≥ 2 of sFSS (x) is sasy
                                                                                FSS (x) =

Fig. 2 (see also the inset) shows a plot of sFSS (x), compared with quadratic, quartic, and
sextic approximation. The agreement is excellent in the region x ≤ 2.
   Before starting the full calculation of the function sFSS (x) let us summarise what we can
learn from the first order approximation in the EML expansion: A rather good approxima-
tion of the full function may be obtained by matching only the first-order small argument
expansion with the large x behaviour ∼ log x (which is exact and does not depend upon the
approximation.) Thus in the following we show how to calculate the coefficients sj without

any approximation.
   Our starting point is again Eq. (88), but this time we will not use EML sum formula.
For this reason we have to be care since the sum is divergent.
   The interesting object is log Zn − n log Z. In particular we can write an FSS ansatz also
for this “free-energy” and so subtract the m = 0 part, obtaining the universal function

                                       n=1
it is the difference of two diverging sums. To make this difference sensible the recipe for the
cut-off explained in the previous section has to be used. Anyway from the computational
point of view it is simpler to make the calculation without care of the cut-off and to adjust
only at the end the result. The numerical sum over the zeroes of the Bessel functions of
generic order cannot be done as before, but the small x expansion of f (x) =                    fj x2j with

This is close to the first order EML result −1/4, signaling that such approximation, not only
reproduces the qualitative physics but is also quantitatively reliable (at the level of 10%.)
In the same manner one can calculate all the coefficients sj , using the more complicated
expressions for the sum of higher negative powers of zeroes of Bessel functions reported in
the literature [22].


VI.   HIGHER DIMENSIONS: SCALING OF ENTROPY AND AREA LAW


   The scaling hypothesis plays a fundamental rule in understanding classical phase tran-
sitions. Crudely speaking, it asserts that the microscopic length scale a does not enter
explicitly into thermodynamic relations near the critical point, as long as the various ther-
modynamic variables are suitable normalised and allowed to scale with their non-trivial
scaling dimensions, related to the various universal critical exponents.
   In fact, from the scaling of the singular part of the free energy density (here t = |T −Tc |/Tc ,
ξ ∝ t−ν is the correlation length, h the external magnetic field, f± (x) a universal function,
the subscript ± refers to the two phases, and yh is the scaling dimension of h)

                                    fsing (t, h) = ξ −d f± (hξ −yh ) ,                        (104)

the critical behaviour of all the thermodynamic observables and in particular the scaling laws
may be derived. Note that fsing is not the total free energy density: there is another non-
universal piece which has an explicit a−d dependence on the microscopic cut-off. However,
this term is analytic in the thermodynamic variables.
   As argued by Srednicki[10], for d > 2 the entropy SA is proportional to the surface area
A of the subsystem A. Thus we should discuss the entropy per unit area s = SA /A. In
analogy with the classical case, we may conjecture a scaling form for the singular part of
the entropy per unit area near a quantum phase transition

                            ssing (g, h, T ) = ξ −(d−1) s± (hξ −yh , T ξ −z ) ,               (105)


                                                  26
where yh > 0 describes the relevant effect of the field conjugated to the order parameter,
z > 0 the relevance of the temperature close the the quantum phase transition (in all the
examples considered up to now z = 1), and all other neglected operators are supposed to be
irrelevant. s± should be a universal function apart from the normalisations of its arguments.
The relation between ξ and g (the parameter driving the transition) is ξ = |g − gc |−ν . As for
the free energy, ssing is not the total entropy: we also expect to find explicitly a-dependent
pieces which are, however, analytic in g.
   From the scaling of the entropy all the scaling laws can be obtained, e.g. the specific heat
goes like
                                                        ∂S
                                           C=T             ∼ T ξ −(d−1+z) .                           (106)
                                                        ∂T
Similar identities can be derived for other observables.
   This scaling can be explicitly checked in the case of the Gaussian model in all dimensions
for h = T = 0 and z = 1. To calculate the entropy of a d-dimensional system close to a
quantum critical point, one has to consider a d + 1 field theory. We consider the geometry
where d − 1 dimensions are translational invariant in a domain delimited by an hypersurface
of area A, and on the remaining two dimensional plane there is a branch cut going from 0
to ∞ in an arbitrary direction. The choice of a different geometry is not expected to change
the main results.
   The two-point function is translational invariant in d − 2 directions and coincides with
Eq. (59) on the cut plane, i.e.
                                                   ∞

   The calculation proceeds as in the one-dimensional case with the substitution m2 →

To have a finite result both the integrations are in a finite region. This means that the
                                                    dd−1 r⊥

   In this way the entropy is

                                                           k⊥ + m2

In general, the integral diverges like a−(d−1) . However the coefficient of this divergence (and
other sub-leading divergences which can occur for sufficiently large d) are in general analytic
in m. There is, however, a finite piece which behaves as md−1 in agreement with (105). Note
however that as d → 1 this singular term combines with the non-singular piece ∝ a−(d−1) to
give the previously found result ∝ log(ma).
   Just as for the classical free energy, one may also conjecture a finite-size scaling form for
the entropy of the form

                   ssing (L, g, h, T ) = L−(d−1) sFSS (L1/ν |g − gc |, Lyh h, Lz T ) .    (110)

For h = T = 0 it reads

                         ssing (L, g, h = T = 0) = As L−(d−1) sFSS (L/ξ) ,                (111)

with sFSS (L/ξ) a function which satisfies sFSS (0) = 1 and sFSS (x) ∝ 1/x for large x, in
order to reproduce the infinite volume limit, and As is a non universal constant fixing the
normalisation of the entropy. In one dimension, this relation again does not make sense. The
log L behaviour may be seen as resulting from a cancellation between the L−(d−1) behaviour
of ssing against a constant term coming from the regular part, with As = O((d − 1)−1 ) as
d → 1. This gives the anticipated form
                                               c
                              Ssing (L, ξ) =     (log L + sFSS (L/ξ)) ,                   (112)

VII.   NOTE ADDED.


   We recently were made aware, some time after this paper appeared in print, that the
result (3.32) for more than one interval is incorrect in general. This error can be traced to
the assumption at the beginning of Sec. 3C that there exists a uniformizing transformation
for the n-sheeted Riemann surface into the sphere. In fact the surface has in general a
non-trivial genus and therefore such a transformation does not exist. For the case of two
intervals and n = 2 it can readily be seen that the surface is topologically a torus, and
therefore the partition function Z2 depends on the whole operator content of the theory, not
only the central charge as claimed. For other values of n the partition function should also
depend on the structure constants (OPE coefficients). It is therefore highly unlikely that
this would not remain true for the derivative at n = 1. Indeed, a study of the computation
for the 2-interval case for a compactified boson, first carried out in 1987 by Dixon et al.[24],
shows that this is the case, and that our (3.32) is incorrect. This is also the result of recent
numerical investigations [25, 26]. We are grateful to V. Pasquier and F. Gliozzi for pointing
out this work.
   Although this error also carries over to the case of a semi-infinite system, mentioned just
below (3.32) and also to Eq. (3.33), it does not impact on our later application of these
methods to studying the time-dependence of the entanglement entropy following a quantum
quench[27]. This is because in this case only the limiting behavior, when the various cross-
ratios are either small or large, is needed, and this is insensitive to the precise form of (3.32).
Likewise, as far as we are aware, all the other conclusions of the present paper remain valid.


   APPENDIX A: TWO-POINT FUNCTION IN A n-SHEETED RIEMANN GE-
OMETRY: INFINITE AND FINITE VOLUME RESULTS


   The Green function G(r, r′) of the Helmholtz differential equation (−∇2r + m2 )f (r) = 0,
with specific boundary condition, is the solution of

                               (−∇2r + m2 )G(r, r′) = δ d (r − r′ ) .

G(r, r′) admits an eigenfunction expansion

                                  G(r, r′ ) =       Nk φk (r)φk (r′ ) ,

in terms of φk (r), eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz differential operator (−∇2r + m2 ). Nk is a
normalisation constant that should be derived from the orthonormality requirement of the
eigenfunctions
                                               Z
                                          Nm       φm (r)φn (r′ )ddr = δnm .

      In the case of a n-sheeted Riemann surface we are interested in, the eigenvalue problem
is solved in polar coordinates r = (x, y) = (r cos θ, r sin θ). A complete set of eigenfunctions
is
                         φaν,i = cos(iνθ)Jν (λi r) ,             φbν,i = sin(iνθ)Jν (λi r) ,       (A1)

with Jν (x) Bessel functions of the first kind. Note that the Bessel functions of the second
kind Yν (x), that are also eigenfunctions of the same differential operator, do not enter in the
expansion since we require regularity at r = 0.
      Let us consider first the solution in a finite geometry. The infinite volume limit is recovered
by taking the limit L → ∞ in the sense of distributions. Imposing the 2πn periodicity
boundary condition we have that ν is an integer multiple of 1/n, i.e. ν = k/n. Constraining
the eigenfunctions to vanish at r = L, the eigenvalues are λi L = αν,i, with αν,i the i-th zero
of the Bessel function.
      Using the orthogonality relation of the Bessel functions (see e.g. [18])

                                                                        L2 2
                         Z L
                               rdrJν (αν,i r/L)Jν ′ (αν ′ ,i r/L) =       J (αν,i )δνν ′ ,
                          0                                             2 ν+1

                                                                               R
The factor dk comes from           0     1dx = 2π and      0

      In the limit L → ∞, the index i becomes continuous αν,i /L → λ and the δνν ′ in the
orthonormality condition is replaced by δ(λ − λ′ ). The limit of the normalisation factor is
Nk (λ) = dk λ/(2πn), that leads to the two-point function reported in the text (59). Note that

a slightly different form of this two-point function (satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions)
was used to investigate the critical behaviour at an edge [23].

[28] As far as we are aware, this analysis has not been extended to systems with many degrees of
     freedom such as we consider in this paper. Indeed, we shall see that for such systems SA can
     be much larger than unity, so cannot have such a simple interpretation.
[29] This restriction is not necessary, but the set-up is easier to picture in this case.
[30] We have assumed that theory is trivial in the infrared. If the RG flow is towards a non-trivial
     theory, c should be replaced by cU V − cIR .
[31] This holds only for non-interacting theories: in the presence of interactions the sum of all the
