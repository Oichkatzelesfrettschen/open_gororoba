1    Introduction
Noncommutative geometry [1] has proven a remarkable successful framework for
understanding the geometrical nature of the standard model of particle physics.
The pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the standard model
grounds on the observation that the Dirac operator on a compact manifold to-
gether with its interaction with the smooth functions on the manifold and its rep-
resentation on square integrable spinors completely characterizes the Riemannian
structure. This leads to the notion of a spectral triple pA, H, Dq, where H is a
separable Hilbert space, A is a commutative involutive algebra represented in H
and D is a self-adjoint operator in H and where A and D has to satisfy certain
conditions. Moreover, these conditions are naturally extended to encompass also
noncommutative algebras. This generalization turns out to be the right framework
to formulate the standard model coupled to general relativity as a single gravita-
tional theory [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, the classical action of the standard
model coupled to gravity emerges from a spectral action principle applied to an al-
gebra which is a noncommutative modification of the algebra of smooth functions
over M [4, 5, 6]. In this formulation the additional interactions (strong, electro-
weak) emerge through inner fluctuations of D generated by the noncommutativity
of the algebra.
     This beautiful formulation of fundamental physics raises the question whether
quantum field theory, too, has a natural translation into the language of non-
commutative geometry. The standard model, after all, is a quantum field theory.
When formulated in terms of noncommutative geometry one recovers, however,
essentially its classical formulation. Moreover, the action of the standard model
emerges as an integrated part of a gravitational theory. Therefore, it appears plau-
sible that if a natural intersection between quantum field theory and noncommu-
tative geometry exist, then it should involve aspects of quantum gravity.
     This line of reasoning is the motivation behind a programme [10, 11, 12, 13,
14] which we initiated in 2005 and which will be the topic here. Basically, the idea
is to adopt a top-down approach to quantum gravity by applying elements of non-
commutative geometry to a quantum gravity setup. In particular, we take inspira-
tion from loop quantum gravity [15, 16, 17], which is based on Ashtekars formula-
tion of general relativity as a gauge field theory. However, whereas loop quantum
gravity is based on an algebra of Wilson loops of the Ashtekar gauge fields, the
idea here is to consider instead the algebra of holonomy loops. Since this algebra
is intrinsically noncommutative we are immediately situated well within the do-
main of noncommutative geometry. To complete the analogy we construct a Dirac

                                           2
type operator and require its interaction with this algebra of holonomies to repro-
duce the quantized Poisson structure of general relativity. Since holonomy loops
are functions over connections this Dirac type operator will resemble a functional
derivation operator over a space of connections.
    The aim of this project is twofold. First, we aim to identify canonical struc-
tures and principles which may help to define a theory of quantum gravity at
a quantized level and thereby avoid the ambiguities which plague the standard
quantization procedure. A Dirac type operator represents exactly such a canon-
ical structure. The hope is that this operator and its interaction with the algebra
of holonomy loops will cast light on the dynamics of quantum gravity. Indeed,
in the last part of this paper we present a heuristic argument as to how a candi-
date for the Hamiltonian of quantum gravity may emerge from this spectral triple
construction.
    Second, the presence of inner automorphisms – due to noncommutativity of
the algebra – will in general introduce an additional gauge sector. In Connes for-
mulation of the standard model the entire bosonic sector arises through such in-
ner automorphisms. Since the algebra of holonomy loops is noncommutative this
mechanism will also apply to the spectral triple construction discussed here. Thus,
although this construction grounds on a purely gravitational setup – Ashtekars for-
mulation of general relativity – it will be a framework of quantum gravity which
simultaneous includes a basic mechanism of unification. Put differently, it seems
plausible that the construction cannot be a framework for pure quantum gravity.
Clearly, we would like to interpret this ”extra” in terms of matter degrees of free-
dom. Whether such an interpretation is valid can only be determined through a
semi-classical analysis.
    The spectral triple construction involves several characteristics of quantum
field theory. For instance, the spectral action functional, which is finite, resembles
a Feynman integral over a space of connections. Also, the construction of the
Dirac type operator naturally entails the canonical commutations relations (CAR)
algebra, a hint at fermionic quantum field theory. The significance of these obser-
vations remains to be clarified.

    The note is organized as follows: in section 2 we first give a brief introduction
to loop quantum gravity with emphasis on topics which we will use in the follow-
ing. In section 3 we present the general idea of the programme and in section 4
we provide the basic details of the spectral triple construction. Sections 5 to 8 are
concerned with the physical interpretation of the construction.

2       Loop quantum gravity and spaces of connections
Loop quantum gravity is based on Ashtekars formulation of general relativity in
terms of gauge field variables [18, 19]. Upon selecting a foliation of the four
dimensional manifold M  R  Σ, where Σ is a three dimensional hypersurface,
the Ashtekar variables are given by a S U p2q-connection Aiν p xq and the inverse,
densitized dreibein E µj p xq, both fields on the hypersurface Σ. The connection is
related to the extrinsic curvature of Σ in M and the dreibein is given by the intrinsic
geometry of Σ. These are conjugate variables and satisfy the Poisson structure

                                tAiνp xq, E µj pyqu  δµνδijδ3p x  yq.                       (1)

These variables are subjected to three constraints, namely the Gauß-, Diffeo-
morphism- and Hamilton Constraints. In one version the Hamilton constraint is
of the form4             »
                            dx3  i jk Fµν

where F is the field strength tensor of A.
    A key step in loop quantum gravity is the shift of variables from the set pA, E q
to a dual set of variables given by holonomies of A and fluxes of E. Therefore,
consider curves γ in Σ and the holonomy transforms

                                          hγ pAq  Holpγ, Aq

of A along γ, and surfaces S in Σ and the fluxes

variables read

where γ  γ1  γ2 intersects S in the point γ1 X γ2 (see figure) and where the sign
corresponds to different orientation of the surface S relative to γ.
    This change of variables is crucial since it permits a reduction of the quan-
tization procedure to a projective system of finite problems related to oriented

     In the following we shall ignore issues regarding the signature of space-time and the reality
of the Irmirzi parameter which we set equal to one. Also, for simplicity we choose here a constant
lapse field.

graphs. Specifically, consider first a finite number of holonomy transforms along
connected curves tγi u in Σ. The union of these curves is a graph Γ. We call the
intersection points of the curves for vertices tv j u in Γ and the curves between ver-
tices for edges tk u. If we denote by A the space of smooth S U p2q connections
on Σ and consider the restriction of A to Γ, in terms of holonomies of connections
along curves, then we see that A reduces to the space

                                     AΓ : GnpΓq ,

where npΓq is the number of edges in Γ. Here each copy of G corresponds to the
holonomy transform along an edge in Γ.
   Consider now the full system of all such piece-wise analytic graphs and their
associated spaces GnpΓi q




Given two graphs Γ1  Γ2 there exist projections between their associated spaces

                                 PΓ2 ;Γ1 : AΓ2 Ñ AΓ1 .

For example, take the two first graphs in the previous figure. The corresponding
spaces are given by AΓ1  G and AΓ2  G4 and the projection between them
reads (with labeling of edges from left to right)

                           PΓ2 ;Γ1 pg1 , g2 , g3 , g4 q  g1  g3 .

A key result by Ashtekar and Lewandowski [20, 21] is that the space A of smooth
connections is densely embedded in the projective limit of spaces tAΓ u, that is

                                A ãÑ lim AΓ : A .

                                                                                  (4)

Thus A can be considered as a completion of the space of connections. The main
              a
advantage of A is that it possesses a natural measure, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski
measure. This measure is simply the inductive limit of Haar measures over spaces

This is the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, denoted Hkin , and
forms the basis of the theory. The quantized holonomy and flux operators ĥL
and FˆS can be constructed as multiplication and derivation operators in Hkin and
one can impose the constraints as operator constraints and thereby, in principle,
attempt to obtain the physical Hilbert space by solving these constraints.
    It is important to notice that Hkin is non-separable. This fact is the first in-
dication that a spectral construction involving this Hilbert space will be hard to
achieve.


3    The project; idea and strategy
The aim of our project is to construct a spectral triple over an algebra of holonomy
loops. This algebra is intrinsically noncommutative and the hope is that this non-
commutativity will entail additional structure much alike the structures generated
by the matrix factor in Connes’ formulation of the standard model.
    With an algebra of holonomy transforms, which we view as maps

                            γ : ∇ Ñ Holpγ, ∇q P Ml pC q ,

where l is the size of a matrix representation of G and where ∇ P A, it is clear that
a spectral triple involving such an algebra will be a geometrical construction over
the space of connection. That is, the space of states on the algebra will be related
to the space A. Accordingly, the Dirac type operator in such a triple must have an
interpretation in terms of functional derivations.
    The strategy to obtain such a construction is to exploit the pro-manifold struc-
                                                       a
ture of A. That is, since A is densely embedded in A which is the projective limit
of manifolds we aim to construct first geometrical structures over these interme-
diate manifolds and subsequently to take their projective and inductive limits over
a suitable system of graphs. Thus, the programme involves the following three
steps:

 # 1: construct spectral triples p BΓ , DΓ , HΓ q at the level of a finite graphs Γ, with
      BΓ being the algebra of holonomy loops, now generated by loops restricted
      to the graph Γ. This step is conceptually easy since AΓ is a compact Lie-
      group with a Haar measure which gives us a natural Hilbert space and can-
      didates for a Dirac operator;


                                           6
 # 2: ensure compatibility with the structure maps

                                    PΓΓ : AΓ Ñ AΓ ,
                                         1           1




      and their enduced maps between Hilbert spaces L2 pAΓ q and L2 pAΓ q. For1


      example, we require
                              PΓΓ  DΓ  DΓ  PΓΓ ;
                                     1           1       1




 # 3: take the projective and inductive limit of the triples p BΓ , DΓ , HΓ q over all
      graphs in the inductive system of graphs. Hereby we obtain a candidate for
      a spectral triple over the full space of connections.
    This programme was first formulated in [10] where we analyzed the possi-
bility to construct a spectral triple based on the projective system of piece-wise
analytic graphs used in loop quantum gravity. However, we found this project un-
likely to succeed due to the large number of constraints coming from the different
projections between embedded graphs. These constraints restrict the Dirac type
operator considerably, and for the loop quantum gravity-setup we were unable to
solve them.
    To overcome these difficulties we have, in a recent series of publications [12,
13, 14], adopted a new strategy where we instead consider a more restricted sys-
tem of graphs. Examples of these restricted systems of graphs are simplicial com-
plexes/triangulations and their barycentric subdivisions, and hyper-lattices and
their sub-lattices obtained by subdividing each cell symmetrically. These exam-
ples all permit a spectral triple construction with interesting properties.


4    The construction
We now give an outline of the construction of the algebra of holonomy loops and
the spectral triple. In the following we work with simplicial complexes and their
barycentric subdivisions. The construction based on lattices and their symmetric
subdivisions is obtained in the same way.

generated by the Li ’s in this norm and let BΓ be the -sub-algebra of BΓ generated
by the Li ’s. We will call this algebra the loop algebra.

The Hilbert space: The next step is to consider representations of the loop alge-
bra. In fact, there is a natural Hilbert space

                            HΓ  L2 pGn , ClpT Gn q b Ml pC qq ,                          (5)

which involves the Clifford bundle over Gn . Here L2 is with respect to the Haar
measure on Gn and l is again the size of the representation of G. The reason for
adding these two factors – the Clifford bundle and the matrix factor – in (5) is to
accommodate the Dirac operator and the algebra of holonomy loops, respectively.
   The loop algebra BΓ has a natural representation on HΓ given by

                      hL  ψp∇q  p1 b ∇pLqq  ψp∇q ,       ψPH,

where the first factor acts on the Clifford-part of the Hilbert space and the second
factor acts by matrix multiplication on the matrix part of the Hilbert space. For
example, the action of the loop

The Dirac operator: Since Gn is a classical geometry we can simply pick a Dirac
operator DΓ on Gn and hereby obtain a candidate for a spectral triple

                                         pBΓ, HΓ, DΓq ,
on the level of the graph Γ. The choice of the Dirac operator is, at this point,
largely free.

# 2: Compatibility with the structure maps

   Consider now a system of nested simplicial complexes

                                   Γ0 Ñ Γ1 Ñ Γ2 Ñ . . . ,

where Γi is the barycentric subdivision of Γi1 . For the corresponding spaces AΓi
we obtain a system

                           AΓ0 ÐÝ  AΓ1 ÐÝ  AΓ2 ÐÝ
                                   P             P         P

                                                   ... ,

where the arrows are projections between the spaces AΓi  GnpΓi q . The aim is to
obtain a system of spectral triples

            pBΓ , HΓ , DΓ q Ø pBΓ , HΓ , DΓ q Ø pBΓ , HΓ , DΓ q Ø . . . ,
               0      0     0          1     1        1        2   2     2
                                                                                         (6)

where the arrows indicate compatibility with the structure maps. It turns out that
the required compatibility is automatic for the algebra, and is easily obtained for
the Hilbert space. For the Dirac operator, however, this requirement strongly re-
stricts the form of permissible operators.
                           Essentially, the problem of solving the compatibility
   G         G             conditions boils down to the simple case where we have
                           a single edge which is subdivided into two edges. This
            P
                           corresponds to the projection

                                           P : G2 Ñ G ,        Ppg1 , g2 q  g1  g2 ,   (7)
        G
                                and a corresponding map between Hilbert spaces

                       P : L2 pG, ClpT Gq b Ml q Ñ L2 pG2 , ClpT Gq b Ml q ,

which leads to the compatibility condition

        P pD1 vqpg1 , g2 q  D2 pP vqpg1 , g2 q ,       v P L2 pG, ClpT Gq b Ml q     (8)

for the Dirac operator. Here D1 denotes a Dirac operator on G, and D2 denotes a
Dirac operator on G2 . In the papers [13, 14] we have found two different solutions
to this compatibility condition. Since the solution described in [13] is considerably
more complicated than the solution described in [14] we shall here describe the
latter. Consider therefore the following change of variables

                   Θ : G2 Ñ G2 ; pg1 , g2 q Ñ pg1  g2 , g2 q : pg11 , g12 q ,

                                                 10
which changes the projection (7) into the simple form

                                   Ppg11 , g12 q  g11 .                            (9)

It is now straight forward to write down a Dirac operator on G2 which is com-
patible with the projection (9). Basically, we can pick any Dirac operator of the
form
                            D2  D1 aD12 , a P R ,                           (10)
where D12 is a Dirac operator on the copy of G in G2 whose coordinates are elim-
inated by the projection (9). At this point the choice of the operator D12 is essen-
tially unrestricted with a being an arbitrary real parameter. However, for reasons
explained in [14] it turns out that D1 and D12 should of the form
                                         ¸
                                  Di           eai  deai ,                       (11)
                                          i,a


where eai denotes a complete set of left-invariant vector fields in TGi , a is a S U p2q
index, and the product in (11) is Clifford multiplication.
    This line of analysis is straightforwardly generalized to repeated subdivisions
and gives rise to a series of free parameters tai u, one for each subdivision. By
solving the G2 Ñ G problem repeatedly, and by piecing together the different
edges, we end up with a Dirac-like operator on the level of Γn of the general form
                                           ¸
                                   DΓn             ak Dk ,                        (12)
                                                k

where Dk is a Dirac type operator corresponding to the k’th level. As already
mentioned, there are several possible Dirac operators which satisfy condition (8).
However, all solutions will be of the general form (12) which involves a sequence
of free parameters. The solution which we have outlined here and which is pub-
lished in [14] entails a Dirac type operator with an easily calculable spectrum.

# 3: The continuum limit

   We are now ready to take the limit of the sequence (6). First, the Hilbert space
H is constructed by adding all the intermediate Hilbert spaces

                   H 1  `Γ L2 pGnpΓq , ClpT GnpΓq q b Ml pC qq{N ,


                                           11
where N is the subspace generated by elements of the form
                                 p. . . , v, . . . , Pi jpvq, . . .q ,
where Pi j are the induced maps between Hilbert spaces. The Hilbert space H
is the completion of H 1 . The inner product on H is the inductive limit inner
product. This Hilbert space is manifestly separable.
    In fact, the Hilbert space H is constructed in the same way as the kinemati-
cal Hilbert space in loop quantum gravity. If we ignore the Clifford bundle, then
the only difference between H and the kinematical Hilbert space is the choice
of graphs, triangulations vs. piece-wise analytic, which corresponds to the sep-
arability of H and the non-separability of the kinematical Hilbert space of loop
quantum gravity. We shall discuss this issue in section 5.1.
    Next, the algebra
                                  B : lim BΓ
                                                    ÝÑ
                                                     Γ


contains loops defined on a simplicial complex Γn in tΓn u. Again, the algebra B
is separable. Finally, the Dirac-like operator DΓn descends to a densely defined
operator on the limit space H
                                         D  lim DΓn .
                                                  ÝÑ
                                                   Γ



   In [13] we prove5 that for a compact Lie-group G the triple pB , H , D q is a
semi-finite spectral triple, which means that:
   1. D ’s resolvent p1       D2 q1 is compact (wrt. trace) and
   2. the commutator rD , as is bounded,
provided the sequence tai u approaches 8 sufficiently fast.
    The term semi-finite means, in this case, that the resolvent of D is in fact not
compact. Instead, the degeneracy of each eigenvalue is finite with respect to a
certain trace and the resolvent is compact with respect to this trace. The trace is
the ordinary operator trace on operators in L2 pA q tensored with the finite trace
                                                    

on the CAR algebra. The CAR algebra in this setup appears as
                                       lim ClpT id AΓn q .
                                         n

   5
    To be precise, we prove in [13] that a semi-finite spectral triple exist for all compact Lie-
groups but that certain deviations to the form described here may be required. For S U p2q these
deviations are not necessary.


                                                  12
    For the case G  U p1q we find that the sequence tan u is required to satisfy

                       an  2n bn ,       where    lim bn  8 .
                                                  n   Ñ8
The exact restrictions on the sequence tan u for arbitrary G may depend on which
Dirac-type operator one chooses.


5    Spaces of connections
Let us now turn to the spaces AΓ and their projective limit. Denote by

                                  A : lim AΓ .
                                      

                                              Γ


                                      
It turns out that the limit space A is a space of generalized connections which
                                                                           
means that the space A of smooth connections is densely embedded in A . This
result mirrors the fundamental result of loop quantum gravity mentioned in section
2 (see equation (4)).
                  
     To see that A contains all smooth connections we first need to map the graphs
tΓ ju into a manifold M
                                 h : Γj Ñ Γj P M .
Then there is a natural map

                     χ:AÑA ,              χp∇qpi q  Holp∇, i q ,
                                 



where Holp∇, i q is again the holonomy of ∇ along i which is now in M. In fact,
χ is an embedding
                                    A ãÑ A .
                                           


                          To see this consider two different connections ∇1 , ∇2 P
         U
                          A which differ in a point m P M and therefore in a
                          neighborhood U of m. Choose a small edge i in a
          i              graphs Γ j so that i P U. Then

                                             Holp∇1 , i q , Holp∇2 , i q .

                                                           
                          This shows exactly that A contains all smooth connec-
                                                                          
                          tions. Furthermore, the image of χ is dense in A , see

                                            13
[13]. These result suggests that the Dirac type operator is a kind of functional
derivation operator over A
                                             δ
                                      D       .
                                            δ∇
In fact, D is a global operator of the heuristic form
                                        ¸                δ
                                 D         ∇p xq           ,
                                                       δ∇p xq
                                                                                         (13)
                                         x


where ∇p xq represents a degree of freedom in each point.
   Furthermore, the inner product of the Hilbert space is a functional integral
over A                                 »
                           xΨ|...|Ψy   rd∇sTr . . . .
                                               A
In total, these observations suggest that the spectral triple construction should be
interpreted in terms of quantum field theory.

5.1    Comparison to loop quantum gravity
                                                                                   a
As already mentioned, loop quantum gravity operates with the space A of gen-
eralized connections based on a projective system of piecewise analytic graphs.
Thus, there are now two different completions6 of the space A of smooth connec-
         a       
tions: A and A with
                            A ãÑ A , A ãÑ A .
                                    a              


The difference between these completions is their corresponding symmetry groups:

   1. In loop quantum gravity the group of analytic diffeomorphisms act as a
      symmetry group,

   2. In the present case we have a much smaller symmetry group of graph auto-
      morphisms which we denote by Diffp4q.
   6
    In fact, there are many completions of A, one for each set of graphs which satisfy certain
’density’ conditions [13].




                                              14

It appears that the use of a restricted system of graphs (simplicial complexes, cubic
lattices or something else) corresponds to a kind of (partial) gauge fixing of the
diffeomorphism group. There is, however, an alternative interpretation. Notice
that a triangulation Γ is also a piecewise analytic graph7 . This means that there is
a natural embedding between the Hilbert spaces

                                       L2 pA q ãÑ L2 pA q ,
                                                         ι            a



where we for now discard the Clifford bundle and the matrix factor from H .
Furthermore, in loop quantum gravity there is the Hilbert space Hdi f f of (spatial)
diffeomorphism invariant states. That is, there exist a surjection

                                         L2 pA q Ñ Hdi f f .
                                                  a           q


We therefore get a map
                                        L2 pA q ÝÑ Hdi f f ,
                                                             Ξ


and obtain the diagram:

                                                                  L 2 pA q
                                                                         a

The amount by which the map Ξ fails to be injective can be thought of as a defi-
nition of the symmetry group diffp4q of graph automorphisms.

       If we choose the triangulation to be piece-wise analytic.


                                                          15
    This suggests that H is directly related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeo-
morphism invariant states known from loop quantum gravity. In this picture we
can therefore think of a holonomy loop in B as an equivalence class of holonomy
loops, up to diffeomorphisms.
    There are several unresolved issues here. For example, it seems that there is
an important difference between the system of cubic lattices and the system of
triangulations: The valence number of vertices in the first case is always fixed, de-
termined by the dimension of the manifold M, whereas the valence of vertices in
the case of triangulations diverges. Thus, for the map Ξ to be surjective we prob-
ably must require the valence of vertices to approach infinity. The exact relation
between the Hilbert spaces H and Hdi f f remains to be analyzed.


6    The Poisson structure of general relativity
The aim of this section is to show that the spectral triple construction quantizes
the Poisson bracket (3). To see this we first calculate the commutator between the
Dirac type operator D and an element of the algebra B . Take first a single group
element g corresponding to the i1 th copy of G in Gn . We find (for simplicity we
set ai  1)                           ¸
                           rD, gs  p  gσk q  ek ,                           (14)
                                         k

where ek P ClpT Gn q and σk is a certain generator of the Lie algebra g. Next, the
commutator between D and the element hL  gi1  gi2 . . . gik is

             rD, hLs  rD, gi sgi . . . gi
                                 1   2         k
                                                   gi1 rD , gi2 s . . . gik   ... ,   (15)

which shows that the action of D is to insert Lie-algebra generators at each vertex
in the loop. Already here we notice a resemblance to the bracket (3) which also
prescribes insertions of Lie-algebra generators into the holonomy loop.
    In fact, if we omit the part which involves Clifford multiplication with the
elements ek P ClpT Gn q then the bracket given by (14) and (15) is essentially a
quantized version of the Poisson bracket (3). Here the holonomy loops belong to
B and the corresponding flux operators, which are now located at the vertices in
the graphs tΓi u, corresponds to the left-invariant vector fields used to construct the
Dirac type operator D . These left-invariant vector fields should be interpreted as
flux operators corresponding to infinitesimal surfaces located at the endpoints of
the edges carrying the copies of G on which the vector fields act. This implies


                                             16
that the Dirac type operator D can be written as a sum of all the flux operators
located at the vertices in the family of graphs tΓi u.
    This shows that the spectral triple construction captures information tanta-
mount to a representation of the Poisson brackets of general relativity. The com-
bination of the algebra of holonomy loops and the Dirac type operator involves
both conjugate variables. The main difference to the representation used in loop
quantum gravity is the choice of graphs. It is important to keep in mind that the
system of graphs which we use here is dense in a double sense: the set of vertices
tviu is a dense set in M and the space of smooth connections is densely embedded
in A .
    If we interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)
diffeomorphism constraint, then we can think of our construction as a quantiza-
tion scheme which deals first with the constraints (partially) and next with the
quantization. That is, a quantization scheme which deviates from the standard
Dirac-type quantization procedure.


7    The square of D
In loop quantum gravity the area operators play an important role. Given a
surface S in M the associated area operator reads [22]
                                         ¸b
                              ApS q               F̂Si n F̂Sj n δi j .
                                          n
             
where S  n S n . Since the area operators are functionals of the flux operators,
and since we have just argued that the Dirac type operator D has the form of a
sum of flux operators, it is natural to ask which role area operators plays in the
spectral triple construction discussed here. What we find is that the square of the
Dirac type operator D has the form of a kind of global area operator. To see this
it suffices to note that the square of D will, to leading order, be a sum of flux
operators squared. Thus, we find that
                                  ¸                        »
                           D 
                             2
                                       . . . ApS v q            Ap x q ,          (16)
                                   v                         Σ


where the sum runs over vertices tvi u and where Ap xq is a kind of area density
squared operator.
            °     The integral over Σ in (17) should be understood in the sense
that the sum v runs over all vertices in tΓi u which is a dense set in M.

                                              17
   It remains to understand exactly which classical interpretation the operator D2
should be given.

The spectral action functional

   Let us here also mention that the spectral action functional – the operator trace
over the heat-kernel – resembles a Feynman integral
                                       »
                                                              
               T r expp spD q q 
                                2
                                            
                                              rd∇s exp  spDq2 δ∇p∇q ,
                                        A

where D2 plays the role of a kind of action or an energy. This object is, for suitable
sequences tan u, finite. Notice also that this object is well defined for any compact
group G and any dimension of the underlying manifold M. It is an interesting
question if this bears any relation to ordinary quantum field theory.


8    The Hamiltonian
A key motivation for constructing the operator D is to find canonical structures
at a quantized level. The spectral action construction represents a top-down ap-
proach to quantum gravity. This means that the relevant question is not ”how to
quantize” certain structures but rather how to obtain a semi-classical analysis once
the construction is completed.
    Thus, a relevant question is whether the spectral triple construction has any-
thing to say about the dynamics of quantum gravity? Does it contain information
about the Hamiltonian of general relativity? In the following we will attempt to
answer this question with an argument as to how a candidate for a Hamilton con-
straint might arise from the spectral triple construction.
    We start with a fluctuation of the Dirac operator. This is generally of the form

                                     D̃  D     W,

where W  arD , bs is a noncommutative 1-form and where a and b are elements
of the algebra. W parametrizes a freedom of choosing the Dirac type operator D
                                                                       
and should be interpreted as a kind of gauge potential over the space A . Consider
now the square of the fluctuated operator

                        D̃2  D2    pD̃2  D2q  D2   FW ,                   (17)

                                             18
where FW  tD , W u 12 tW, W u. We now propose that the quantized Hamiltonian
constraint should be of the form
                                          TrpFW Ψq  0 .                               (18)
Here, Tr is with respect to S U p2q. Heuristically, this expression has the right
form. To see this we first expand the loop L according to
                                      L1           α2 F       ,
where α2 is the area expanded by the ”small” loop and F is the field strength
tensor of the Ashtekar connection. Furthermore, D is heuristically of the form
                                           »
                                 D             dxeij p xq  Êij p xq ,
                                             Σ
which can be seen from (13) and from the fact that the sum runs over a dense set
in M. Here eij p xq represents again an element in the Clifford bundle. When we
combine these expressions we obtain, to second order in α, the following:
                TrpD̃2  D2 q
                       » »
                                dxdyteij p xqÊij p xq, rekl pyqÊkl pyq, α2 F su .
                        Σ    Σ

However the anti commutator of eij p xq and ekl pyq will produce a delta function in
x  y, and we get an expression similar to
                                 »
                                     dxki j F̂µν
                                               k
                                                  p xqÊ µj p xqÊiνp xq ,
which has the same structure as (8) and therefore resembles a quantization of the
Hamilton constraint.
    It is important to emphasize that this argument, in its present form, only works
at a heuristic level. We expect that much can be added to the argument in the form
of additional structure. For instance, when discussing fluctuation of the Dirac op-
erator one should also consider a real structure, which, at present, has not been
analyzed nor constructed. Furthermore, a rigorous semiclassical analysis is nec-
essary to fully estimate the significance of an expression like (18).
    However, it is clear that once the spectral triple pB , H , D q is constructed,
then an object like expression (17) and the constraint (18) are canonical and free of
the ordering ambiguities which one encounters in a standard quantization scheme.
Also, these expression require no regularization. This indicates that a spectral
triple construction like the one discussed here might indeed help define a canonical
theory of quantum gravity.

                                                    19
9       The sequence taiu
Recall that the Dirac operator D depends on a se-
quence tai u of real parameters. To understand and                               ai
interpret the spectral triple construction it is neces-
sary to understand the significance of these parame-
                                                                                 ai 1
ters.
    First, the role of the parameters tai u is to set a
scale. Edges which lie ’deep’ in the inductive system                            ai 2

of graphs are assigned large a’s compared to edges
which lie ’higher’ (see figure). This means that a ’coarse grained’ loop corre-
sponds to small a’s whereas a ’refined’ loop corresponds to large a’s.
    Therefore, when D probes a loop the eigenvalues corresponding to ’coarse’
information about the loop are weighted with smaller a’s compared to eigenvalues
which corresponds to more ’refined’ information.
    It is the requirement of D to have compact resolvent which dictates this addi-
tional scaling degree of freedom. At present we have no clear interpretation of this
structure, except that this seems important in order to extract topological informa-
tion of the underlying manifold. Furthermore, such a scaling degree of freedom is
reminiscent of the renormalization group theory of lattice gauge theory.
    There is in fact a natural choice for the a’s since they correspond to a split of
an edge in two. This suggest the sequence

                                         an  2n .

However, although this sequence is divergent, it is in fact exactly the sequence
where D fails to be spectral. This means that infinities (for example, in the spec-
tral action functional) will arise for exactly this choice8 . Instead one could try
with the permissible sequence

                                      an  p2      qn ,

and subsequently take the limit  Ñ 0. One may speculate whether the infinities
which arise in this limit might somehow be related to the infinities one encounters
in the renormalization procedure of quantum field theory.
    8
     This statement probably depends on the exact choice of Dirac type operator. We know it is
valid for the Dirac type operators constructed in [14].




                                             20
10      Connes Distance Formula
Given a spectral triple pA, D, H q over a manifold M Connes spectral distance for-
mula reads
                  dpξ x , ξy q  sup t|ξ x paq  ξy paq|||rD, as| ¤ 1u ,
                                P
                               a A

where ξ x , ξy are the evaluation homomorphisms A Ñ C in x, y and where dpξ x , ξy q
is the geodesic distance between x and y on M given by metric structure of D. The
interesting observation, which is central to noncommutative geometry, is that this
distance formula can be straight forwardly generalized to noncommutative spaces
and algebras.
     For us, the question therefore arises what Connes distance formula has to say
about the spectral triple construction which we discuss here. It turns out that
a distance formula which involves the algebra B and the Dirac type operator
D will provide us with a notion of distance on a space of field configurations.
The exact meaning of such a formula depends on the state-space of the algebra
B . Without going into detail let us here just state that two field configurations,
each given by a connection, will be ’far’ apart if they differ on a large scale and
’close’ if they differ by a short scale. The reason for this is again the sequence
tanu of scaling parameters. If the two field configurations differ on edges which
corresponds to small a’s – corresponding to large scales – then the corresponding
distance will be relatively smaller compared to edges which are assigned large a’s.


11      Conclussion
In this note we have outlined the motivation, construction and interpretation of the
spectral triple construction already presented in [12][13][14]. To recapitulate, the
semi-finite spectral triple p B , D , H q consist of:
     - the algebra B of holonomy loops,

     - the Dirac type operator D which resembles a global functional derivation
       operator,

     - the Hilbert space H which is related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeo-
       morphism invariant states.
Furthermore, the interaction between B and D encodes the quantized Poisson
structure of general relativity when formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables.

                                          21
    Technically, the triple is constructed as a projective/inductive limit of finite
dimensional spectral triples associated to oriented graphs. Also, the construction
of the spectral triple relies on a set tai u of scaling parameters. It is the correct
scaling behavior of these parameters which ensures that the construction meets
the requirements of a spectral triple.
    Finally, we present an argument as to how a quantized Hamiltonian of general
relativity might emerge from a spectral triple construction like the one presented
here. This heuristic argument provides a new, top-down approach to the formula-
tion of a dynamical principle of quantum gravity.
