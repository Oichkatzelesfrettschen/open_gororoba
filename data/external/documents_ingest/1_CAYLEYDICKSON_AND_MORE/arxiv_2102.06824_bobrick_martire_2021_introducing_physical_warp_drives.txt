Abstract. The Alcubierre warp drive is an exotic solution in general relativity.
It allows for superluminal travel at the cost of enormous amounts of matter
with negative mass density. For this reason, the Alcubierre warp drive has been
widely considered unphysical. In this study, we develop a model of a general
warp drive spacetime in classical relativity that encloses all existing warp drive
definitions and allows for new metrics without the most serious issues present
in the Alcubierre solution. We present the first general model for subluminal
positive-energy, spherically symmetric warp drives; construct superluminal warpdrive solutions which satisfy quantum inequalities; provide optimizations for the
Alcubierre metric that decrease the negative energy requirements by two orders of
magnitude; and introduce a warp drive spacetime in which space capacity and the
rate of time can be chosen in a controlled manner. Conceptually, we demonstrate
that any warp drive, including the Alcubierre drive, is a shell of regular or exotic
material moving inertially with a certain velocity. Therefore, any warp drive
requires propulsion. We show that a class of subluminal, spherically symmetric
warp drive spacetimes, at least in principle, can be constructed based on the
physical principles known to humanity today.

1. Introduction
The classical-relativistic Alcubierre drive solution allows timelike observers to travel
superluminally, although at the expense of using material with negative rest-mass
energy (Alcubierre 1994); for recent reviews see also (Lobo 2007, Alcubierre &
Lobo 2017). This solution is given by the following asymptotically-flat metric:
ds2 = −c2 dt2 + (dx − f (rs )vs dt)2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,
p

(x − vs t)2 + y 2 + z 2 .

where rs =
The metric describes a spherical warp bubble
(a region deviating from the flat metric) moving along the x-axis with an arbitrary
velocity vs , which may be larger or smaller than the speed of light c.
The shape function f (rs ), present in the metric, defines the size and profile of the
warp bubble. For large distances rs from the bubble, f (rs ) = 0 and the spacetime is
flat. For small distances, rs ≈ 0, the shape function f (rs ) = 1, and the metric describes
the flat internal region of the bubble. In a coordinate system with x → x0 = x−vs t, this
internal region is described explicitly by the Minkowski flat metric. The intermediate

region, for which f (rs ) & 0, corresponds to the spherical boundary of the warp. In
the original study, (Alcubierre 1994) chose function f (rs ), somewhat arbitrarily, as:
fAlc (rs ) =

tanh(σ(rs + R)) − tanh(σ(rs − R))
,
2 tanh(σR)

(2)

where parameters R and σ −1 define the radius and the thickness of the transition from
the internal to the external region, correspondingly.
In the case of superluminal motion, the metric possesses a black hole-like event
horizon behind the bubble and a white hole-like event horizon in front of it (Finazzi
et al. 2009). These event horizons arise because timelike observers cannot exit the
superluminal ship in the direction ahead of it, and cannot enter it from behind. In
both cases, the timelike observers would have to move superluminally when outside
of the ship.
The energy density for the Alcubierre drive, as measured by Eulerian observers
(uµ = (1, 0, 0, 0)), is given by:

2
1 ρ2 vs2 df
00
,
(3)
T =−
8π 4rs2 drs
where ρ2 ≡ y 2 + z 2 is the cylindrical coordinate.
Despite its interesting properties which allow timelike observers to travel at
arbitrary velocities, the Alcubierre drive solution possesses several drawbacks. As
noted earlier, it requires negative energy densities, Equation (3), and thus violates the
weak energy condition. Although negative energy densities are a general property
of any superluminal drive (Olum 1998, Visser et al. 2000), the energy density is
also negative at subluminal speeds for the Alcubierre drive, even in the weak-field
approximation (Lobo & Visser 2004). Additionally, superluminal motion allows for
closed timelike loops, e.g. leading to grandfather paradox, and violates the null energy
condition and causality, e.g. (Everett 1996), although the latter may be recovered at
the expense of Lorentz invariance (Liberati et al. 2002). When moving superluminally,
the drive has an additional problem. It leads to quantum instabilities related to pair
production near the horizon behind the warp as well as accumulation of particles at
the horizon in the front part of the warp (Finazzi et al. 2009).
The Alcubierre drive is also problematic at sub-relativistic speeds. Firstly, it
requires unphysically large amounts of (negative) energy. For instance, it would require
an amount of negative energy comparable to the mass of the Sun to produce relativistic
bubbles of ≈ meter sizes (Alcubierre 1994). Furthermore, such high negative energy
densities do not appear even theoretically feasible. There are no known materials
which would allow for gathering large amounts of negative energy in a controlled
way. While zero-point vacuum fluctuations may produce negative energies in curved
spacetimes, for Alcubierre drives this situation is only possible if the walls of the
bubble had thicknesses comparable to Planck scales. Such thin walls, however, require
extreme amounts of energy – comparable to the rest-mass energy of the Universe –
as may be seen from Equation (3). Therefore, there is no physical way to create an
Alcubierre drive (Pfenning & Ford 1997, Ford & Roman 1997).
Finally, there is no proposed way of creating an Alcubierre drive, even if negative
energy were available. In the original study, (Alcubierre 1994) suggested that the
velocity may be time-dependent, vs = vs (t). Indeed, Equation (3) retains its form even
for time-dependent velocities. And, since vs = 0 corresponds to flat spacetime, it was
assumed that the Alcubierre drive might be generated through acceleration. However,

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

the metric in Equation (1) with time-variable vs = vs (t) corresponds to a time-variable
stress-energy tensor which does not satisfy continuity equations. Alternatively, such
solutions may be said to require an implicit dynamical field to effectively provide
propulsion for the object, e.g. (Bassett et al. 2000). Generally, there are no selfconsistent warp drive solutions proposed in the literature which can self-accelerate at
all from zero velocities, not to mention gain superluminal speeds.
Despite the rather extensive work on the properties of the Alcubierre drive
solution, it remains unclear which of the above issues are features of the Alcubierre
solution specifically or more fundamental properties of warp drives as such. New warp
drive solutions have been introduced only in very few studies. (Van Den Broeck 1999)
reduced the energy requirements of the Alcubierre drive to about the mass of the
Sun while satisfying the vacuum energy inequalities. The reduction was realized
by decreasing the externally measured size of the warp bubble down to 10−15 m
while keeping the internal volume constant. This solution satisfies the weak energy
conditions, although it requires that classical gravity remains applicable down to such
small scales, at which it was never tested. However, as we show in Appendix A through
a coordinate transformation, this solution is equivalent to the Alcubierre solution.
(Natário 2002) constructed a warp drive solution without space contraction or
expansion, contrary to the earlier assumption that it facilitated the movement of
warp drives. (Natário 2006) constructed a new subluminal warp drive solution in the
weak-field regime, which required negative energies. (Loup et al. 2001) had previously
introduced a modified version of the Alcubierre drive intended to alter the rate of
time for the observers inside the bubble. However, their modification reduces to the
original Alcubierre metric, as we also show in Appendix A. Finally, (Lentz 2020)
has recently proposed a warp drive metric claiming to have purely positive energy
everywhere in both subluminal and superluminal regimes, although without providing
means to reproduce the study.
The works above, to our knowledge, summarize all the modifications of the
Alcubierre drive available in the literature. Superluminal travel had also been studied
by (Krasnikov 1998) and (Everett & Roman 1997). In these studies, the authors
introduced Krasnikov tubes. Krasnikov tubes are ‘spacetime tunnels’ which allow for
superluminal travel without violating causality, but only for round trips and with
much larger energy requirements than the Alcubierre drive. Superluminal travel has
also been discussed in the context of wormholes, e.g. (Garattini & Lobo 2007), and
time-machine metrics, e.g. (Fermi & Pizzocchero 2018), in all cases requiring negative
energies. Finally, modified gravity theories may provide some desirable properties
for the Alcubierre drive. For instance, conformal gravity allows for construction of
Alcubierre solutions with positive energy only (Varieschi & Burstein 2013), while
extra-dimensional theories of gravity may reduce the energy requirements of the drive
(White 2013).
In this study, we show that the properties of the Alcubierre metric – in particular,
its negative energy density and the accompanying immense energy requirements – are
not a necessary feature of warp drive spacetimes. In Section 2, we discuss that any
general warp drive, including the Alcubierre metric, may be thought of as a shell of
positive- or negative-energy density material which modifies the state of spacetime in
the flat vacuum region inside it. In Section 3, we introduce, for the first time, the most
general spherically symmetric warp drives. We show that the reason for the negative
energy requirements of the Alcubierre metric and all the warp drives introduced in
the literature is, likely, the truncation of the gravitational field outside of the metric,

and the accelerated rate of time compared to the comoving free observer. In turn, the
most general positive-energy (spherical) warp drive solutions must slow down the time
compared to the comoving observer and have a gradual (Schwarzschild) fall off of the
gravitational field. In Section 4, we introduce a simple method to construct warp drive
metrics by choosing the state of spacetime inside them. Additionally, we show that the
Alcubierre metric is only a particular member of a much more general class of warp
drive solutions admitting negative energy densities. Subsequently, we construct several
spacetimes with a range of new properties. We introduce a macroscopic negativeenergy drive which satisfies quantum inequalities, as well as several metrics with
negative-energies which allow one to control the rate of time and spatial contraction
inside the drive. In Section 5, we review the interpretation of warp drives in light of
this study.
2. General class of warp drives
2.1. Definition of a general warp drive spacetime
We define a general warp drive spacetime, as shown in Figure 1, as an asymptoticallyflat vacuum region Dout (background) which encloses a compact arbitrarily curved
region Dwarp with a spherical topology (the warping region); Dwarp , in turn, encloses
a flat extended‡ compact region Din with a trivial topology (the ‘passenger’ area).
This definition covers both all the existing warp drive spacetimes, such as the one by
(Alcubierre 1994), as well as trivial solutions, such as weak-field perturbations of the
Minkowski spacetime. To formalize the difference between extreme and mild cases
like these, we shall consider the warped region Dwarp by using comoving reference
frames located inside and outside it, which will allow us to quantify how strong its
gravitational influence is.
We shall focus on warp drive spacetimes which, intuitively, are stationary or nonchanging from the ‘passenger’ point of view. More formally, we consider warp drive
spacetimes which, by definition, admit a global Killing vector field, ξ, which is aligned
with the four-velocity of the boundary of the region ∂Din (the inner boundary of the
shaded region in Figure 1). Such a field establishes the global frame of rest with
respect to the warped region. Subsequently, whenever we discuss a physical motion
of an observer relative to the warp drive, we consider, locally, the motion relative to
the global reference frame defined by the field ξ. Furthermore, using this vector field
will allow us to apply the well-known techniques suitable for spacetimes possessing a
timelike Killing vector to analyse and classify warp drive spacetimes.
Since the internal region Din is flat, vector field ξ is constant in that region.
Therefore, in the internal region, this vector field ξ defines a reference frame (tetrad)
for the internal observer§ Oin . Similarly, in the asymptotic infinity, vector field ξ
defines the frame of the remote comoving observer Oout,co . This comoving reference
frame Oout,co , as we further argue, is the most natural frame against which one can
compare the frame Oin inside the warped region. Finally, this remote comoving
‡ To avoid effectively including general asymptotically-flat spacetimes in the defintion, we require
that the extent of the region Din should be non-vanishing and physically interesting. In other words,
the inner region Din should be large enough to allow observers to conduct physical experiments of
desired scales.
§ While, in relativity, physical observers are timelike by definition, we shall occasionally be
mentioning timelike and spacelike observers for convenience. By these, we shall understand physical
observers and spacelike frames, correspondingly.

Figure 1.
A schematic illustration of a warp-drive spacetime.
The
spacetime consists of three regions: Asymptotically-flat vacuum background Dout
(background), general stationary curved region Dwarp with a spherical topology
(the warping region) and a flat inner region Din (‘passenger’ space). Any such
spacetime, including the Alcubierre drive metric, is realised through a shell of
ordinary or exotic negative energy density material filling the warping region
Dwarp . Axis x shows the direction of motion, while ρ is the cylindrical radius.
As we discuss in Section 4.1, flattened disk-shaped metrics minimise energy
requirements of the particular Alcubierre, but not necessarily other, warp drive
spacetimes. As we also discuss in Section 5, warp drive spacetimes require some
form of propulsion in order to accelerate. For this reason, in physical realisations
of such spacetimes, the front and rear parts are likely asymmetric.

observer Oout,co may be moving with constant three-velocity vs with respect to a
timelike observer Oout , the latter of which we shall consider to be at rest. Everywhere
in this study, apart from the general discussion in this section, we shall consider warp
drives spacetimes which are axisymmetric along the direction of motion.
The three-velocity of the comoving observer vs , which represents the velocity of
the warped region relative to the remote observer Oout , may be slower or faster than
the speed of light with respect to the observer. This corresponds to four-velocity of
the comoving observer Oout,co being timelike, null or spacelike. Both observers Oin
and Oout,co , therefore, may in general, at least formally, be timelike, null, or spacelike.
If region Dwarp contained vanishing stress-energy tensor, the whole spacetime would
be close to Minkowski spacetime and the two observers Oin and Oout would both be

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

timelike, null, or spacelike at the same time. However, it is also possible for region
Dwarp to be sufficiently curved such that, as we show further, the norms of the fourvelocities of observers Oin and Oout,co may be different from each other. Therefore,
all stationary warp drive spacetimes may be split into four distinct classes, based on
whether the remote comoving observer Oout,co moves subluminally (subluminal drives)
or superluminally (superluminal drives), and whether the internal observer Oin has
the same norm as the comoving observer Oout,co (mild warp drives) or different norm
from the comoving observer (extreme warp drives):
Class I: Mild subluminal warp drives: These spacetimes are defined by the
vector field ξ being timelike everywhere. Consequently, three-velocities of such
drives are subluminal, i.e. vs < c. Spacetimes of this class approach the flat
Minkowski spacetime in the trivial limit, and observers Oin , Oout,co reduce to
a pair of co-moving timelike Lorentz observers. Non-trivial members of this
class contain spacetimes with region Dwarp sufficiently curved, so that tetrads
of observers Oin and Oout,co differ significantly from each other, i.e. the observers
read off different rates of clocks and lengths of rulers. At the same time, such
spacetimes also contain weak-field solutions corresponding to classical shell-like
objects moving with subluminal velocities and weakly modifying the state of the
spacetime inside them. Such solutions are possible because the Dwarp region may
be set arbitrarily close to being flat, rendering the whole spacetime arbitrarily
close to Minkowski spacetime.
Class II: Mild superluminal warp drives: These spacetimes are characterized by
the vector field ξ being spacelike or null everywhere. Consequently, such warp
drives have luminal or superluminal velocities, i.e., vs ≥ c. These spacetimes
also admit a trivial limit, wherein they reduce to flat Minkowski spacetime, with
the tetrads Oin , Oout,co corresponding to a pair of comoving null or spacelike
(superluminal) ‘observers’. Weak-field members of the class correspond to small
amounts of ‘superluminal matter’ in the region Dwarp introducing small differences
in the measurements of frames Oin , Oout,co . By ‘superluminal matter’ we
understand the matter at rest with respect to a space-like reference frame. In
the case of the stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid, such matter violates the
dominant energy condition. A general spacetime of this class introduces nontrivial differences between frames Oin and Oout,co . Since superluminal matter
cannot be produced from physical matter, and since null or spacelike tetrads
cannot be associated with physical observers, the spacetimes of this class have
limited interest.
Class III: Extreme superluminal warp drives: These spacetimes are defined by
the vector field ξ being timelike in the inner region Din , but null or spacelike in the
asymptotic infinity of the outer region Dout . The remote comoving observers in
such spacetimes move luminally or superluminally relative to the resting timelike
observer Oout , i.e., vs ≥ c. This class of spacetimes does not contain trivial
solutions and the warped region Dwarp is sufficiently curved to allow timelike
observers Oin to be moving superluminally relative to the timelike observer Oout
(and as a consequence, the timelike observer Oin will be travelling back in time
0
from the point of view of yet another remote timelike observer Oout
). At the
same time, the comoving observer Oout,co is formally superluminal; in other
words, remote timelike observers cannot be comoving with a warp drive of this
class. For such spacetimes, we can define a Killing horizon ∂DK as the minimal

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

boundary surface where the Killing vector field ξ becomes null. A necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for warp drives of this class to be physical is that the
Killing horizon ∂DK does not intersect with region Dwarp . If the Killing horizon
did intersect with region Dwarp , some part of the matter in that region would
be at rest with respect to spacelike tetrads aligned with vector field ξ. In other
words, a fraction of matter in the region Dwarp would have to be superluminal (in
the same sense, as for Class II above) and violate the dominant energy condition.
Class IV: ‘Extreme’ subluminal warp drives: Spacetimes of this class are
defined by the vector field ξ being null or spacelike in the inner region Din , but
timelike at the asymptotic infinity of the outer region Dout . Since the comoving
observer Oout,co is timelike, such spacetimes are subluminal, i.e. vs < c. Since the
Killing vector is spacelike in the inner region Din , no timelike internal observers
can be at rest relative to the inner boundary of the drive ∂Din . This property
bears similarity to black hole spacetimes, except for that the inner region Din for
this class of spacetimes is flat everywhere. A necessary condition for spacetimes
of this class to be physical is that the Killing horizon coincides with the boundary
of the inner region, ∂Din . Otherwise, some fraction of matter in the region Dwarp
will be superluminal, as in the previous class.
In practical terms, as follows from our definition, any warp drive spacetime may
be seen as a shell of ordinary or exotic material which fills region Dwarp and moves with
some constant velocity relative to an external timelike observer Oout . The presence
of the shell inevitably modifies the space and time in the inner region Din . This
modification leads (in addition to other effects) to a difference in the measurements
of times and lengths between an observer in the inner region Din and a comoving
remote observer Oout,co . General warp drive spacetimes, therefore, form a continuous
family which includes both trivial (flat or nearly-flat) and non-trivial (strongly curved)
spacetimes.
2.2. How do existing warp drive spacetimes fit in the classification?
The Alcubierre drive is a truncated warp drive spacetime defined by meeting the three
requirements. First, that the external spacetime Dout is Minkowskian. In other words,
the matter in the warped region Dwarp does not exhibit gravitational influence outside
of it (Requirement 1). Second, observers Oin and Oout are always timelike, and the
tetrads of these observers are equal to each other. In other words, the clock rates and
the lengths of the rulers of observers Oin and Oout are synchronized and put equal to
each other (Requirement 2). Finally, the warped region Dwarp is functionally limited
to Equations (1) and (2) in Section 1 (Requirement 3). For subluminal velocities, the
Alcubierre drive belongs to Class I, mild subluminal warp drives. For superluminal
velocities it belongs to Class III, extreme superluminal warp drives.
Compared to general warp drives, this set of constraints may seem artificial.
For example, requiring that the material of the Alcubierre drive does not gravitate
in region Dout , which is non-typical for massive objects, as we discuss further in
Section 3, unnecessarily puts strong constraints on the stress-energy tensor in region
Dwarp . Similarly, requiring that the time of observers Oin is synchronized with the time
of observers Oout means that, at least in the subluminal regime, the time of internal
observers Oin is accelerated compared to the time of remote comoving observers
Oout,co . In comparison, general warp drive spacetimes do not need to be truncated

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

8

and may allow an arbitrary relation between the measurements of observers Oin and
Oout,co .
A more general class of warp drive metric was proposed by (Natário 2002).
However, their most general warp drive, similarly to the Alcubierre solution, still
imposes Requirements 1 and 2 from the Alcubierre metric. That is, is also makes
region Dout strictly flat outside of the drive and synchronizes the time of the internal
and the resting (not comoving) observers. Similarly to the Alcubierre solution, the
(Natário 2002) class of spacetimes also belongs to Class I in the subluminal regime
and Class III in the superluminal regime.
Further, in Sections 4 and 3, we show that general warp drive spacetimes are
diverse and can have a variety of properties that are often more appealing compared
to either the Alcubierre spacetime or to the (Natário 2002) class of spacetimes.
2.3. Properties of warp drive spacetimes
In this section, we summarise the standard tools applicable for analyzing general warp
drives, in order to apply them further in Sections 4 and 3.
The internal physical volumeRof a warp drive measured by observer Oin , inside the
warped region, is given by Vin ≡ Din d3 xiin . For truncated warp drive spacetimes, i.e.
spacetimes where Rthe outside vacuum region Dout is flat, the external volume may be
defined as Vout ≡ Din∪warp d3 xiout . The integral is calculated over the volume enclosing
the warped region and assuming, during the integration, that the volume’s interior is
flat. Such a construction provides a measure of the size of the warp bubble as observed
from outside. It may be formally done with the help of the Cartesian coordinate grid
of the remote observer Oout , analytically extended to cover the warped region. The
comoving external volume Vout,co may be similarly defined for the comoving observer.
For general asymptotically-flat metrics, we do not consider external volumes as they
are coordinate-dependent.
We calculate the energy density, the momentum flux, and their volume integrals
for warp drive spacetimes, and the mechanical stress distributions, in the coordinate
system adapted to the remote comoving observer Oout,co . The coordinate system
adapted to the comoving observer is aligned with the Killing vector field ξ, which
allows for a 3+1 decomposition of the spacetime and thus provides coordinate-invariant
measures for the total energy, mass and momentum of the drive. We also consider
a system of Eulerian observers defined through four-velocities uµ = √ 1 00 (1, 0, 0, 0),
−g

similar to how it was done in (Alcubierre 1994). These observers are imperatively
timelike and are normal to the surfaces of constant time, but are coordinate-dependent.
The energy density w in each of the coordinate systems is given by w =
(−g 00 )−1 T 00 . The momentum flux j i and the pressure P in the same reference system
are given by j i = uµ T µi = √ 1 00 T 0i and P = T µν (δµν − uµ uν ) = T + (g 00 )−1 T 00 ,
−g

where T ≡ T µν gµν . Notably, the total energy and

Warp drive solutions may be compared based on how they satisfy different energy
conditions. Among these are the strong and weak energy conditions. Furthermore, we
also consider quantum inequalities, e.g. (Pfenning & Ford 1997). These inequalities,
at least in the weak-field regime, potentially allow the spacetime curvature to modify

where τ is the proper time of the observer and τ0 is an arbitrary constant smaller than
the local radius of curvature.
3. General spherically symmetric warp drives
3.1. General subluminal spherically symmetric drives
One may gain considerable intuition into the nature of warp drive spacetimes by
considering spacetimes which are spherically symmetric in the comoving reference
frame. Since spherically symmetric spacetimes are fully solvable in relativity, we may
achieve full characterization of such warp drive spacetimes. More formally, in this
section, we limit ourselves to spacetimes which contain an SO(3) group whose orbits
are orthogonal to the Killing vector field ξ introduced in Section 2. The Killing vector
field ξ defines the local frame of rest in the comoving reference frame. As we comment
further, the presence of such a group is possible only for class I and IV spacetimes,
i.e., subluminal warp drives.
Class I of subluminal warp drives – mild subluminal warp drives – contains
trivial solutions and may be associated with ordinary objects, such as a thin shell
of non-exotic material. However, the well-known Alcubierre and Natário drives, in the
subluminal regime, also belong to the same class. By considering general spherically
symmetric subluminal warp drives, we shall gain considerable intuition about these
spacetimes and provide a possible explanation for their negative energy requirement.
The most general metric for a spherically symmetric stationary spacetime can be
written in Schwarzschild coordinates as:
ds2 = −N (r)c2 dt2 + Λ(r)dr2 + r2 (dθ2 + sin2 θdϕ2 ),

(5)

where functions N (r) and Λ(r) are general. Therefore, energy density of a spherically
symmetric warp drive spacetime, in the comoving reference frame, is given by:


r 0
1
)
(6)
w(r) =
1−(
8πr2
Λ(r)
A necessary condition for the spherically symmetric metric in Equation (5) (above) to
describe a warp drive spacetime is that the energy density w in both the inner region
Din and outer region Dout be equal to zero. In particular, as follows from Equation (6),
for any spherically symmetric warp drive, Λ(r) = 1 in region Din . Furthermore,
integrating Equation (6), we can express the metric function Λ(r) directly through
the energy density distribution:
1
R
Λ(r) =
(7)
2 r
1 − r 0 4πw(r0 )r02 dr0
Equations (6) and (7) allow us to analyze the energy density distribution of
spherically symmetric solutions and to construct such spacetimes from any desired
energy distribution. Thus, we may see that for purely positive energy spacetimes,
Λ(r) > 1 in the outside region Dout . This result is in agreement with the Birkhoff’s
theorem, and states that the metric in the region Dout is described by the Schwarzschild
solution. In comparison, for truncated warp drive spacetimes, such as the Alcubierre

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

10

or Natário solutions, the metric in the external region isR assumed to be strictly flat.
r
This assumption necessarily requires that the integral 0 out 4πw(r0 )r02 dr0 = 0. As
a result, any non-trivial truncated spherically symmetric warp drive must contain
regions where the energy density is negative. Therefore, the fact that Alcubierre
and Natário solutions are truncated may partly explain why they require negative
energy even in subluminal regimes. Finally, for any spherically symmetric warp drive
spacetime, since Λ(0) = Λ(r → ∞) = 1, coordinate r describes the same physical
length scale both inside the drive and at the asymptotic infinity. In other words,
unlike the drives discussed in (Van Den Broeck 1999), spherically symmetric warp
drives cannot contain objects which significantly exceed the sizes of warp drives, as
measured by external observers.
We may further calculate the spatial component of the stress energy tensor.
To do so, we assume that the material in region Dwarp is an isotropic fluid, i.e.
Trr = P (r)Λ(r). This way, we obtain the pressure of the material which constitutes
the warp drive:
1 − Λ(r) + rN 0 (r)/N (r)
(8)
P (r)Λ(r) =
r2
By requiring that P = 0 in the inner vacuum region Din , and by remembering that
Λ(r) = 1 in that region, we can see that N (r) is constant in
R rDin . In the external
region Dout , from Equation (8), N (r) = (Λ(r))−1 = 1 − 2r 0 4πw(r0 )r02 dr0 . This
result also follows from Birkhoff’s theorem, according to which spherically symmetric
spacetimes must be static and asymptotically flat. In the vacuum region, such setup,
by definition, corresponds to the Schwarzschild solution (assuming the central object
is
neutral), which matches by the form the equation for N (r). In this case,

We can now obtain N (r) in region Dwarp , and this way determine N (r) in the
inner region Din . We do this by writing down the equation for continuity of the stressenergy tensor, T µr;µ = 0, similarly to how it is done for Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff
(TOV) equation. As a result, we obtain:

Firstly, we make a simplifying assumption that density ρ is a function of only pressure
P , as, for example, is the case for the polytropic equation of state. Then, by using
the condition that P = 0 at the inner and outer boundary of the warp region Dwarp ,
we find that the integral of the right-hand side over Dwarp vanishes. As a result, we
conclude that N (rin ) = N (rout ), where rin and rout are the locations of the inner and
outer boundary of the region Dwarp .
From the solution for N (r) in the outside region Dout , we see that the time-time
coefficient of the metric N (r) at the asymptotic infinity can only be larger than inside
the warped region. In other words, for a subluminal warp drive based on non-exotic
matter, the time inside the drive can only pass more slowly than it does for a remote
Minkowski observer comoving with the drive. For scale, an Earth-mass shell of 10
meter radius will slow down the rate of time by a small fraction of 4 · 10−4 . If we
require that the time in the inner region goes faster than in the reference frame of
the comoving observer, the material in the warp drive would have to contain negative
energy. This is the case for the Alcubierre and Natário drives. In these drives, the
time is passing more quickly in the inside region than it is in the reference frame of the
remote comoving observer (due to the clocks in the inner region being synchronized

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

11

to the remote observer at rest). This is another related possible reason why the
Alcubierre drive requires negative energy even in the subluminal mode.
3.2. Impossibility of superluminal spherically symmetric spacetimes
The method from the previous section could potentially have been useful for analysing
superluminal warp drives. However, superluminal classes of warp drives (Classes II and
III) cannot be spherically symmetric. This fact is closely related to the impossibility of
superluminal spherical objects in special relativity, e.g. (Fayngold 2002). In Section 2,
we have introduced a Killing vector field ξ, which defines a local frame of rest with
respect to the drive. In superluminal warp drives, vector field ξ becomes spacelike
whether inside or outside of the drive. In order both to maintain spherical symmetry
and for the field ξ to remain orthogonal to the orbits of the SO(3) group, the spatial
component of the field ξ can only be radial with respect to the drive. Therefore, at
asymptotic infinity, comoving observers for such a spacetime would have to be moving
radially towards or away from a spherically symmetric drive. In other words, warp
drives cannot be both spherically symmetric and move superluminally.
Similarly, Class IV drives cannot be spherically symmetric. As follows from
Equation (7), in order for the radial basis vector inside the drive to be timelike,
one would need to have non-zero energy density present in the vacuum inner region
Din . Therefore, all spherically symmetric positive-energy warp drive solutions belong
to Class I. These solutions are always subluminal, satisfy the energy conditions,
and are devoid of causality paradoxes present in superluminal metrics. Overall, the
subluminal spherically symmetric solution presented in this section is the first example
of manifestly positive energy warp drive spacetimes.
4. Axisymmetric warp drives with a general internal region
In this section, we explore the diversity of axisymmetric warp drive solutions. There
are some limitations on possible axisymmetric solutions. Explicitly expressing a
metric through a desired stress-energy tensor in a closed form is not possible for a
general axisymmetric spacetime. Therefore, we leave generalizing the positive energy
spherically symmetric warp drive solutions to the axisymmetric case to future studies.
However, by constructing sufficiently broad classes of metrics, we show that interesting
solutions are possible even within these less general classes.
4.1. Method for constructing axisymmetric warp drive solutions
Below we introduce a method, by which one can construct new metrics for a warp
drive spacetime. For constructing new solutions, following the discussion in Section 3,
we focus on choosing how the spacetime properties of the observers inside the inner
region Oin relate to those of remote observers Oout . This choice may put significant
constraints on the energy content of the spacetime, and may potentially be exploited
to find spacetimes with lower energy requirements. Additionally, having an explicit
way to define the properties of spacetime inside the inner region Din allows us to
explore and demonstrate the diversity of possible warp drive solutions.
As discussed in Section 2, any stationary warp drive spacetime may be associated
with a coordinate system xµco , adapted to the Killing vector ξ which defines the rest
frame of the craft. We also adopt a global coordinate system xµ which asymptotically,

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

12

at infinity, approaches the coordinate system of the resting observer Oout in region
Dout . Since the two charts xµco and xµ cover the whole spacetime and overlap, it is, in
principle, possible to introduce a mapping from one to another in the regions Din and
Dwarp . The procedure for constructing an axisymmetric warp drive spacetime from
this subclass is as follows:
1. Choose a one-to-one mapping xµco (xν ) between the coordinate system xµco adopted
to the comoving observer inside the inner region Oin and the coordinate system
xν adopted to the external observer at rest Oout .
2. Choose functions fx (xico ), fy (xico ), fz (xico ), ft (xico ) which are equal to 1 in region
Din and are equal to 0 in region Dout . These functions define the shape and size
of the warp region Dwarp from the point of view of observer Oin .
3. Formulate the metric of the spacetime as:
ds2 = −c2 (dt(1−ft )+ft dtco )2 +(dx(1−fx )+fx dxco )2 +

(10)

+(dy(1 − fy ) + fy dyco )2 + (dz(1 − fz ) + fz dzco )2 ,
Express the metric in terms of a common coordinate system xµ00 , by expressing
xµco and xν explicitly through xµ00 .
4. Analyze the metric with the methods introduced in Section 2.3
The procedure above is based on the idea of explicitly comparing the
measurements of observers Oin and Oout . Indeed, in region Din all the functions
fη = 1, and the metric corresponds to the coordinate system of observer Oin
2
2
). Similarly, asymptotically, in region Dout all
+ dzco
(ds2 = −c2 dt2co + dx2co + dyco
the functions fη = 0 and the metric corresponds to the coordinate system of the
remote observer at rest Oout (ds2 = −c2 dt2 + dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ). Several studies in
the literature, e.g. (Loup et al. 2001), have proposed modifications of the Alcubierre
metric without explicitly considering the measurements of inner and outer observers.
Such modifications may be erroneous and may reduce to coordinate transformations,
as happens in (Loup et al. 2001) case. We discuss these studies further in Appendix
A.
The procedure developed here assumes that the observers Oin and Oout are
timelike, and therefore leads to warp drive spacetimes of Class I in the subluminal
regime, and of Class III in the superluminal regime. While these classes of spacetimes
are arguably most interesting, the procedure may be easily generalized to cover the
spacetimes of Class II and Class IV. We also comment that while the procedure
ensures a relationship for the measurements of observers Oin and Oout , one may
also use it to obtain different coordinate representations and, potentially, different
spacetimes satisfying the same relationships between the observers. Subsequently, one
may choose, for example, the most interesting spacetimes of the class.
As a demonstration, we show how the above procedure may be used to construct
the Alcubierre metric given by Equation (1).
1. We choose the one-to-one mapping as follows:

dtco = dt



dxco = dx − vs dt
dyco = dy



dzco = dz

(11)

2. We select fx = f , where f is given by Equation (2), whereas functions fy , fz and
ft cancel out in Equation (10) and will not contribute to the metric.
3. We arrive at the metric ds2 = −c2 dt2 + (dx − f (rs )vs dt)2 + dy 2 + dz 2 , as given
by Equation (1).
This example once again highlights the fact that the Alcubierre metric is based
on a rather artificial identification of spacetime properties between the two observers
Oin and Oout , in particular increasing the rate of the time passing for the observer
Oin . In the following sections, we explore other possible axisymmetric spacetimes and
show that they have more appealing properties than the Alcubierre metric.
4.2. Reducing Etot by flattening the Alcubierre metrics
We start by considering the flattened Alcubierre metrics. The longitudinal extent is
a simple property of the Alcubierre metric. However, it has not been studied in the
literature, despite having several interesting properties.
The longitudinal extent has several peculiarities for the Alcubierre metric. Indeed,
in Equation (1), for sufficiently large distances rs0 from the center of the warped region,
function f (rs ) vanishes in the Alcubierre solution. Therefore, the external observer O
perceives the boundaries of the warped region Dwarp as a sphere of radius rs0 moving
with velocity vs . If the velocity vs is subluminal due to Lorentz contraction, the
boundary of the warped region Dwarp must be elongated for the comoving observers.
Moreover, when the Alcubierre warp drive approaches the speed of light while at the
same time preserving its energy content, given by Equation (3), the warped region
must appear infinitely elongated. The divergent elongation of the solution in the
comoving frame puts into question the possibility of accelerating Alcubierre metrics
beyond the speed of light.
To analyze the solutions deformed along the axis of motion, we switch to more
convenient cylindrical coordinates (y, z) → (ρ, θ). For the transition regions described
by Equation (1), a more
p general non-spherically symmetric metric may be obtained by
replacing f (rs ) ≡ f ( (x − xs )2 + ρ2 ) −→ f (x − xs , ρ). Notablyk, for the Alcubierre
drive, recalculating the energy density with f = f (x − xs , ρ) simplifies the expression,
compared to Equation (2):
 2
1 vs2 ∂f
w=−
(12)
8π 4 ∂ρ
This form leads to three useful implications. The first implication is that,
for a given velocity of the warp drive vs , the most optimal way of reducing the
total energy, as measured by Eulerian observers, is by flattening the shape of the
√
warp drive. Indeed, as −g = ρ for the Alcubierre metric, the total energy
 2

v2 R ∞
E = − 16s −∞ dx 0 ρdρ ∂f
. And indeed, flattening the warp drive by a factor
∂ρ
of αX (αX > 1) – i.e., by replacing f (x − xs , ρ) → f (αX (x − xs ), ρ), as may be
shown through variable change αX (x − xs ) → x0 – leads to the energy reduction by
E → E/αX . Similarly, elongating the drive (choosing αX < 1) increases its energy
requirements. Therefore, putting aside the fundamental issues related to negative
energy of Alcubierre drives, an optimal implementation of such spacetimes would
likely be flattened in shape.
k We believe, this form has not been found in the literature so far

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

14

The second implication of Equation (2) is that the flattening of the warped region
may be adjusted with velocity so that the drive preserves the same total energy.
Indeed, setting αX = 1 + v 2 leads to E → E/(1 + v 2 ), asymptotically removing the
dependency of the total energy on velocity. As discussed earlier in Section 1, the fact
that the total energy of the Alcubierre drive depends on velocity is problematic. This
is because the energy and momentum conservation, applicable to asymptotically-flat
spacetimes, implies that the Alcubierre drive must be changing its already very large
energy (and mass) as it accelerates. Removing or softening the dependence of the
total energy on velocity may, in principle, lead to more efficient ways of accelerating
the drive to large velocities.
Finally, the third implication of Equation (2) is that it allows one to construct
superluminal solutions which satisfy the quantum inequalities given by Equation (4).
Indeed, selecting a sufficiently large αX allows one to reduce the thickness of the
warp in x-direction down to nearly-Planck scale size (correspondingly, allowing only
for extremely thin physical observers inside the warp bubble). As a result, the
local curvature radius in Equation (4) may be arbitrarily small, thus satisfying the
quantum inequalities given by Equation (4). At the same time, such superluminal
drives still maintain a macroscopic size in ρ-direction perpendicular to the direction
of motion and, more importantly, do not increase their densities due to contraction.
Such solutions, may offer an exciting possibility of superluminal physical solutions.
Perhaps, they may help probe the physics of superluminal motion and the problems
associated with it, e.g. the violation of causality (Krasnikov 1998), (Everett &
Roman 1997). However, they more likely probe the limits of applicability of the
quantum inequalities (4), which are derived in semiclassical gravity approximation.
Indeed, superluminal motion violates the averaged null energy condition (Visser
et al. 2000), and the latter does not have the same dependency on the dimensions
of the bubble as the quantum inequalities, e.g. (Graham & Olum 2007). As a result,
even the extremely flattened version of the Alcubierre drive, as discussed here, does
not satisfy the averaged null energy conditions.
4.3. Lorentz drive
The Alcubierre metric is artificial in the sense that it forces the clocks and rulers of
observers Oin and Oout to be synchronized. An arguably more natural choice would
be to require that the observer Oin should experience the same time dilation and space
contraction as a Lorentz observer would experience when moving with velocity vs < c.
Since Lorentz transformations are defined for subluminal speeds, in this section, we
consider subluminal warp drives of Class I. To construct the spacetime, we choose:
vs dx
(13)
dtco = γ(dt − 2 )
c
dxco = γ(dx − vs dt),
where γ is the Lorentz gamma-factor. Using these definitions to construct the warp
drive metric with Equation (10) leads to a diagonal metric:
ds2 = −c2 F 2 dt2 + F 2 dx2 + dρ2 + ρ2 dθ2 ,
2

(14)

where F ≡ 1 + 2f (1 − f )(γ − 1). Moreover, any diagonalizable warp drive spacetimes
are described by Equation (13) (the diagonal form is retained if γ is replaced by any
constant).

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

15

The energy density for this metric is given by:
w=−

1 (ρFρ0 )0ρ
8π ρF

(15)

For this metric, independent of the choice of function f (x − xs , ρ), the region
Dwarp contains areas of both positive and negative energy density. This result is likely
related to the fact that the spacetime is effectively flat beyond a certain radius, rather
than asymptotically approaching the flat spacetime, similarly to the Schwarzschild
solution. In the case of spherically symmetric solutions, as discussed in Section 3,
such truncation of the gravitational field also requires the warp region Dwarp to contain
regions of positive and negative energy.
The Lorentz drive metric may be generalized to porduce a continuous limit
to flat spacetime. Indeed, if region Dwarp were replaced by Minkowski spacetime,
the whole spacetime would be Minkowski space. Therefore, one may introduce a
continuum of solutions parametrized by a dimensionless parameter λ ∈ [0, 1], by using
F 2 ≡ 1+2λf (1−f )(γ −1). For λ = 0 the whole spacetime reduces to a flat spacetime,
and for λ = 1 the Lorentz warp drive solution is recovered. The intermediate values of
λ allow for solutions with smaller energy requirements. To our knowledge, this is the
first example of a family of warp drive solutions containing near-Minkowski metrics.
4.4. An improved Van Den Broeck’s drive
The warp drive solution by (Van Den Broeck 1999) is intended to reduce the energy
requirements of warp drives by significantly expanding the volume of the Alcubierre
drive inside radius rs while significantly decreasing the externally measured size of
the craft. In this section, we realize the idea of (Van Den Broeck 1999) in a simpler
and, importantly, coordinate-independent form. We select the relation between clocks
of the internal and the external observers to be the same as in the Alcubierre
metric, dtco = dt, but choose the internal spacetime to be expanded in x-direction:
dxco = A(dx − vs dt), dρco = dρ, dθco = dθ, where A > 1. Substituting these relations
into Equation (10), we obtain the resulting spacetime:
ds2 = −c2 dt2 + (dx + f (A − 1)dx − f Avs dt)2 + dρ2 + ρ2 dθ2
This spacetime leads to the energy density distribution of:
"
#
A2 fρ02
(ρfρ0 )0ρ
1 vs2
+ (A − 1)
w=−
8π 4 (1 + (A − 1)f )2
(1 + (A − 1)f )

(16)

(17)

The expression contains a velocity-independent component, which also leads to regions
of positive and negative energy density. We see here that while stretching the
space inside the warp drive does lead to higher energy density, the metric may be
optimized to achieve the highest internal volume per unit energy needed to construct
the spacetime.
4.5. Warp drive metric with modified time
In this section, we consider spacetimes, in which the clocks in the region Din run at
a different rate compared to the clocks in the region Dout . This is done by letting
dtco = A−1 dt, where A > 1 corresponds to the clocks going slower in the region Din .

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

16

Substituting this relation into Equation (10) and otherwise using the same definitions
as in the Alcubierre solution, we obtain:
ds2 = −c2 ((1 − f )dt + A−1 f dt)2 + (dx − f vs dt)2 + dρ2 + ρ2 dθ2 (18)
The resulting energy density for the Eulerian observers is:
 2
1 (1 − (A−1 − 1)f )2 vs2 ∂f
·
w=−
8π (1 + (A−1 − 1)f )4 4 ∂ρ

(19)

This demonstrates that the rate of clocks used in the original Alcubierre solution
(A = 1) in fact leads to the simplest possible expression for the total energy of the
warp drive, other parameters being constant. From Equation (19) it follows that
slowing down the clocks inside the Alcubierre drive leads to higher amounts of energy
density from the point of view of Eulerian observers.
4.6. Spinning warp drive metric
Finally, our method can be used to construct relatively complex relations between
the inner and outer regions. For example, the following metric corresponds to the
two Minkowski regions Din and Dout spinning with respect to each other. In other
words, the observers at rest in region Din will be rotating with respect to observers in
region Dout without experiencing any centrifugal or Coriolis forces typical to rotating
systems. Such settings are impossible to realize in the absence of the transition region
Dwarp . The settings may be achieved by relating dθco = dθ − ωs dt, in addition to the
definition used for the Alcubierre drive, where ωs is a constant parameter defining the
angular velocity. Substituting these relations into Equation (10) leads to the following
metric:
ds2 = −c2 dt2 + (dx − vs f dt)2 + dρ2 + (ρdθ − f ρωs dt)2 ,
The energy density for Eulerian observers then is:
"  

(20)

(21)

We see that the energy density is negatively defined independent of the spin or velocity
of the inner region. Additionally, the contributions from the velocity in x-direction
and the velocity of angular rotation have a similar form. The main interest for such
spacetimes may be that they offer a stationary, dissipationless way of storing energy
or angular momentum.
5. Discussion
5.1. What is a warp drive?
One of the main conclusions of our study is that warp drives are simpler and
much less mysterious objects than the broader literature has suggested when citing
(Alcubierre 1994). Warp drives are inertially moving shells of positive or negative
energy material which enclose a ‘passenger’ region with a flat metric. The main
feature distinguishing warp drives from trivial inertially moving low-mass shells is
that the large amount of energy contained in the warp shell allows one to modify the
state of spacetime inside it. In particular, as shown in Sections 3 and 4, the time in
the inner region may go faster or slower than it would go without the shell. Similarly,

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

17

the spatial volume may be stretched, compressed, or even be rotating compared to its
normal state. Further, more complex, modifications are likewise possible.
Warp drives can move superluminally only in the same sense as any ordinary
inertial mass, test mass, or any other object. Namely, there is no known way of
accelerating regular material beyond the speed of light. However, one may postulate a
test particle which moves faster than light in relativity, in which case it may continue
moving inertially. In the same way, as warp drives are shells of material, there is
no known way of accelerating a warp drive beyond the speed of light. However, one
may also postulate the warp drive shell to be in superluminal motion, just like the
hypothetical test particles, and the shell-like object will continue moving in the same
fashion. In this sense, superluminal warp drives are at least as hypothetically possible
as any other superluminal objects.
An interesting feature of warp drives, from the theoretical point of view, is
that the modifications of the spacetime in the internal region may be sufficiently
strong so as to allow superluminal objects to move subluminally or vice versa. The
different possibilities are embodied in four different classes of warp drives, presented
in Section 2. In particular, there are solutions possible (Class IV) wherein a shell of
subluminal material may contain regions where no subluminal material can remain at
rest no matter what velocity it has. In this aspect, the shells of these hypothetical Class
IV warp drives would share properties with black holes. Further, such a spacetime
could effectively stop and contain inside a hypothetical superluminal test-mass object,
or make it move slower than the speed of light.
Similarly, one may hypothesize a spherical shell moving faster than the speed
of light, but which contains an inner region where no (hypothetical) superluminal
objects can be at rest relative to the shell (Class III). Or, in another interpretation,
subluminal normal objects inside such shell could be at rest with respect to them,
despite their motion being superluminal. This class of warp drives, which also includes
the Alcubierre drive, however, remains entirely hypothetical, just in the same way as
no other object can be set to move superluminally. Using the methods in Section 2,
one can examine whether any other particular spacetime belongs to this class of warp
drives.
5.2. Constructing warp drives
Warp drives, being inertially moving shells of normal or exotic material, do not have
any natural way of changing their velocities. They are just like any other types of
inertially moving objects. Similarly, just like for any other massive objects, achieving
a certain velocity for a warp drive requires an externally applied force or, more
practically, some form of propulsion. Propulsion may be realized, for example, by
an interaction with a bosonic field, or regular gaseous or plasma material.
Whatever is the acceleration mechanism, it must obey the conservation of 4momentum. This is because all warp drive spacetimes are asymptotically-flat. An
unfortunate error, introduced in (Alcubierre 1994), was to postulate the velocity in
Equation (1) to be time-variable. An Alcubierre spacetime with time-variable velocity
also changes its energy and momentum with time, and, this way, such a construction
violates energy conservation. More technically, the metric given by Equation (1) does
not satisfy the continuity equations, unless additional dynamical fields are implicitly
introduced to compensate for that. In view of this, no metric which describes an
accelerating warp drive solution has so far been presented in the literature.

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

18

A more subtle point is that the Alcubierre and Natário drives, as well as the
spacetimes constructed in Section 4, represent classes of different objects parametrized
by velocity v rather than the same object changing its velocity v. In particular,
different warp drive solutions with different values of v have different mass, different
energy content, and often different shapes in their reference frame of rest. Any
realistic object should at least conserve its ADM-mass in the subluminal regime and its
analogue in the superluminal regime. A natural way of constructing such spacetimes
is by defining them explicitly in their frame of rest, as discussed in Section 2 and
implemented for spherically symmetric drives in Section 3. Implementing metrics
for such accelerating objects and more general axisymmetric objects which preserve
their shape and mass in the comoving frame as they change their velocity remains a
subject for future studies. As a simple compromise, one may also adjust the shape
of the warp drive with velocity so as to conserve the mass of the drive, as suggested
in Section 4.1. Finally, among all classes of subluminal warp drive solutions, the
particularly interesting ones in the practical sense are those classes which contain a
continuous set of solutions ranging from trivial to highly curved.
At least in the subluminal case, warp drive spacetimes may be constructed by
using purely positive energy density, as presented in Section 3 for the spherically
symmetric case. They can likewise be constructed using purely negative energy
density, as is the case for the Alcubierre solution, or constructed using both positive
and negative energy density. In Section 3 we showed, for the first time, that the only
type of modification to the internal spacetime that is achievable with purely positive
energy for spherically symmetric warp drives is slowing down the rate of time inside
the craft.
In Section 4 we demonstrated that, by using both positive and negative
energy density, one may achieve a variety of modifications for the spacetime inside
more general axisymmetric subluminal warp drives. The range of all the possible
modifications achievable with purely positive energy in the general axisymmetric case,
and whether the class of axisymmetric spacetimes in Section 4 may lead to purely
positive energy metrics, remain important open questions in the field. Similarly, in
Section 2 we have provided a new argument why superluminal warp drive solutions
may always violate weak energy conditions resulting in their negative energy density
requirements. While this is an established fact (Olum 1998, Visser et al. 2000), a
strict independent proof of this based on our argument is another important avenue
for future studies. Our conclusions do not support the recent claim in (Lentz 2020)
of superluminal purely positive energy warp drive solutions, which merits further
investigation.
5.3. Optimal members in the class
An interesting question remaining is: assuming that a practical realization of a warp
drive spacetime is possible, what would the optimized versions look like? As we
showed in Section 4.2, a more optimal implementation of the Alcubierre warp drives
would be flattened in shape, since such shapes are more efficient in terms of energy
requirements. In particular, flattening the shape by a factor of 10 would lead to
proportionally smaller energy requirements. This conclusion likely holds for the,
more physical, purely positive energy subluminal warp drives as well. Curiously, as
we discussed in Section 4.1, extreme flattening of Alcubierre drives may allow for
superluminal solutions which satisfy quantum inequalities, without reaching extreme

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

19

energy densities.
For the Alcubierre solution, one may similarly optimize the energy requirement by
finding the most suitable shape function f¯(rs ). The originally proposed function given
by Equation (2), is not optimized and was originally chosen solely for demonstration.
By applying the variational method to the expression for the total energy of the
Alcubierre drive, we find that the shape function optimizing the energy is given by
f¯(rs ) = min( rr0s , 1), where r0 is a free parameter determining the inner size of the
region Dwarp . Using this slower-decreasing shape reduces the energy requirement for
a similarly sized Alcubierre drive by about a factor of three. The physical reason
for it, as we discuss in Section 3, is perhaps related to the fact that truncating the
gravitational fields of a warp drive, as done in the Alcubierre solution, may increase the
(absolute) amount of necessary negative energy compared to the more slowly falling off
solutions. We provide the details of this derivation in Appendix A.3, and also remark
that optimizing the shape or matter distribution in region Dwarp can be equally well
performed for all the other warp drive solutions.
Given the wide range of possible states of spacetime achievable inside a warp
drive, it is also possible to imagine more complex and instrumental optimizations.
For example, one may speculate that it is possible, at least in principle, to form a
region inside a subluminal warp drive which is similar to ergospheres of spinning black
holes. In this case, such a region would be used as an efficient energy storage. The
energy could then potentially be extracted through a Penrose process applied to the
propellant of the craft, when passing through the ergoregion. Similarly to the Penrose
process for spinning black holes, the extracted energy would likely be coming from the
rotation of some regions of the spacetime.
Finally, since all warp drive objects require propulsion in order to accelerate, any
practical implementation of such objects would have to be asymmetric in shape, since
the back part would have to accommodate a propellant exhaust system. One may
further hypothesise on setups, wherein black hole-like regions of the spacetime may
be used to produce accretion power. Accretion of material onto black holes is known
to be a few tens of times more efficient at extracting rest-mass energy in the form of
electromagnetic radiation from the material than nuclear burning (Frank et al. 2002).
Such a process could potentially provide both a source of energy and a source of
propulsion.
5.4. Towards physical warp drives
In Section 3, we demonstrated that it is possible to construct non-trivial warp drive
solutions with purely positive energy. In other words, at least in principle, one can
construct objects of progressively larger masses and with progressively more salient
modifications to the internal spacetime. While the mass requirements needed for such
modifications are still enormous at present, our work suggests a method of constructing
such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.
The most promising way of practically probing such spacetimes is through
laboratory experiments – most importantly – through analogue gravity experiments,
e.g. (Barceló et al. 2005). Another important avenue of exploring such spacetimes,
especially the accelerating solutions, is through numerical relativity. Such experiments
may bring a better understanding of purely positive energy drives, and negative energy
solutions, as well as the possibility of accelerating objects superluminally.
Since the introduction of (Alcubierre 1994), much theoretical effort has been put

Introducing Physical Warp Drives

20

into unveiling the unphysical nature of the Alcubierre solution. Our work shows that
there is a variety of warp solutions, each with properties often much more physical and
interesting than the originally proposed spacetime. Through this, we suggest there
is a need for broader theoretical and experimental investigation to uncover the full
diversity and properties of physical warp drives.

Appendix A. Existing warp drive solutions
The previously mentioned Alcubierre and Natário metrics are distinct from each other
and satisfy the definition of warp drive metrics. In this section, we list the metrics
present in the literature that claim or intend to describe new warp drive metrics.
We further show that these metrics reduce to the Alcubierre and Natário solutions.
We also comment that the (Lentz 2020) study likely forms a new class of warp drive
spacetimes, though it does not provide means for reproducing itself.
Appendix A.1. Loup metric
The non-refereed study by (Loup et al. 2001), also discussed in the (Alcubierre &
Lobo 2017) review, aims to reduce the energy requirements of the (Alcubierre 1994)
drive by introducing a lapse function, which modifies the time-components of the
metric as a function of spatial coordinates. However, their metric is equivalent to the
Alcubierre metric.
Indeed, their defining Equations (7)–(9), expressed in our notation, read:
ds2 = −A2 (rs )c2 dt2 + (dx − f (rs )vs dt)2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,

(A.1)

where A(rs ) ≥ 1 is the lapse function, defined to be equal to unity at rs = 0 and,
asymptotically, at rs → ∞. However, by transforming to a new time coordinate
A(rs )dt → dt̄, and checking that the coordinate transformation has a finite nonvanishing Jacobian and is, therefore, well-defined, we arrive at:
ds2 = −c2 dt̄2 + (dx − f¯(rs )vs dt̄)2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,
(A.2)
f (rs )
. Therefore, the Loup metric is that of the Alcubierre drive.
where f¯(rs ) ≡ A(r
s)
The shape function, f¯(rs ), as in the Alcubierre solution, is equal to 1 at rs = 0
and asymptotically approaches 0 at infinity. Unlike in the Alcubierre solution, the
shape function now decreases non-monotonically, which corresponds to redistributing
the energy density, according to Equation (3). Assuming the volume of the inner flat
region is preserved, such a shape function only increases the total energy required by
the solution.

Appendix A.2. Van Den Broeck metric
The study by (Van Den Broeck 1999) provided a metric, which intended to significantly
reduce the energy requirements compared to the Alcubierre solution. Such a reduction
was made by reducing the outer surface area of the warped region Dwarp and through
expanding the volume in the interior region Din .
The (Van Den Broeck 1999) metric is given as:

ds2 = −c2 dt2 + B 2 (rs ) (dx − f (rs )vs dt)2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,
(A.3)
where B(rs ) ≥ 1 is a monotonically decreasing function, taking large values B  1
at rs = 0 and asymptotically decreasing to unity. By applying a coordinate
transformation defined by dx̄ = dxB(rs ), dȳ = dyB(rs ), dz̄ = dzB(rs ) and t̄ = t
and ensuring that the transformation is well-defined, by checking that the Jacobian
of the transformation is finite and non-vanishing, the metric transforms to:

At the center of the warped region rs = 0 or, equivalently, x = vs t. In the new
coordinates this corresponds to x̄ = B(0)vs t. Therefore, in the new coordinates, the
object moves with velocity v̄s ≡ B(0)vs . Finally, introducing a new shape function
s )B(rs )
, we arrive again at the Alcubierre metric:
f¯(r̄s ) = f (rB(0)
ds2 = −c2 dt̄2 + (dx̄ − f¯(r̄s )v̄s dt̄)2 + dȳ 2 + dz̄ 2
(A.5)
The modified shape function f¯(r̄s ) satisfies the condition f¯(0) = 1 and decreases to
zero asymptotically at large values of r̄s . As for the Alcubierre solution, dx̄ − v̄s dt̄,
dȳ, dz̄, dt̄ correspond to the coordinates adapted to a resting observer inside the
inner region Din . Therefore, the physical size of the inner region of the metric, as
measured by the inner observer, is given by the region where function f¯(r̄s ) is close
to unity. In the Van Den Broeck example, function B(rs ) is sharp-peaked at the
center, B(0) = B(R̃) ≈ 1017 , and B(R̃ + ∆) = 1, where R̃ = ∆ = 10−15 m. In the
coordinates of the internal observer, Oin , the inner region is limited to rs = R̃, or
r̄s = B(0)rs = 100 m, which corresponds to the physical size of the inner region. The
location, where function B(rs ) decreases to 1, corresponds to r̄s ≈ 200 m, at which
point f¯(r̄s ) = 10−17 , i.e. is nearly vanishing. In the Van Den Broeck example, function
f¯(r̄s ) should subsequently decrease further to zero, between distances corresponding
to rs = R and rs = R + 102 vs LP , i.e. in a thin region 100vs Planck scales thick. Since,
at these distances, B(r̄s ) = 1, the interval of r̄s , at which the function f¯(r̄s ) decreases
from 10−17 to 0, is also 100vs Planck scales thick.
Therefore, in summary, the Van Den Broeck solution is equivalent to the
Alcubierre solution. The shape function f (r̄s ) in their study is chosen to decrease
to nearly zero within a volume comparable to the inner volume of the drive (Region
1). Subsequently, further out, the function f (r̄s ) decreases to exactly zero (Region 2).
Since in the second outer region (Region 2), function f (r̄s ) decreases from a very small
initial value to zero, it is expected that Region 2 should correspond to a small total
energy and satisfy the quantum inequalities due to its near-zero thickness. As follows
from our derivation, the total energy in the inner Region 1, and of the Van Den Broeck
metric as a whole, is comparable to that of the standard Alcubierre solution of similar
dimensions. Our derivation suggests that the total energy should be proportional to
B(0)2 , through the v̄s2 term. The absence in the van den Broeck expression for Region
1 of dependence on B(0) or on the velocity at all, potentially explains why the energies
they obtain for that region are small.
Appendix A.3. Optimizing the energy requirements of the Alcubierre solution
This section provides details on how one may optimize a warp drive solution in terms
of its energy requirements. As an example, we choose the well-known Alcubierre
solution. The total energy measured by Eulerian observers on a hypersurface
t for this spacetime is given, as follows from Section 2.3, by E =

that the contravariant time-time component of the metric tensor and the metric
determinant are equal to minus unity, i.e. g 00 = g = −1. In this case, by using
Equation (3) for the value of energy density T 00 , the total energy is obtained from a
simple expression:

Function f (rs ) in this equation defines the location of the wall of the warp bubble
and is given by Equation (2). As we discuss in the main text, the specific form of
the function was chosen in (Alcubierre 1994) rather arbitrarily in order to satisfy the
requirement that f (rs ) = 1 for rs → 0 and f (rs ) = 0 for rs → ∞. Therefore, one may
search for other functions satisfying the same constraints and leading to some further
desired properties, for example, an optimised energy.
To formulate a variational problem, we switch to spherical coordinates (rs , θ, ϕ)
centered at x = xs (t), y = z = 0, with the pole aligned with the direction of motion.
In these coordinates, ρ = rs sin θ, and we get:

The Lagrangian for this system is L = rs2 fr02s , and therefore the Euler-Lagrange
equation for the function f (rs ) which optimizes the energy reads:
∂ 2 0

(r f ) =

(A.8)

The solution of this equation is f¯(rs ) = C + rDs . The requirement that f (rs ) = 0 at
rs → ∞ can be satisfied by setting C = 0, while the requirement that f (rs ) = 1 for
rs → 0 may be satisfied by setting D = r0 . Since the variational problem was solved
for r > r0 , the optimal solution in the whole space is given by f¯(rs ) = min( rr0 , 1).
One may verify numerically that this choice of f¯ decreases the needed (absolute
value of) negative energy of the Alcubierre solution by about a factor of 3.
Intuitively, the decrease may be understood because a smooth fall-off is more natural
for gravitating bodies than a sharp-exponential cut in the metric introduced by
Equation (2). Repeating the derivation but assuming that f is a general axisymmetric
function of both ρ and x − xs shows that in this case the energy is optimized by an
infinitely thin shape, similar to the conclusions we obtained in Section 4. We conclude
this section by mentioning that one can apply a similar method to other warp drive
spacetimes (or even classes of warp drive spacetimes) to optimize their properties such
as the total energy.
