A search for violation of Lorentz invariance in the production of top quark pairs (tt ) is presented. The measured
normalized diﬀerential tt production cross section, as a function of the sidereal time, is examined for potential
modulations induced by Lorentz-invariance breaking operators in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory extension of the
standard model (SM). The cross section is measured from collision events collected by the CMS detector at a
center-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 , and containing one
electron and one muon. The results are found to be compatible with zero, in agreement with the SM, and are
used to place upper limits at 68% conﬁdence level on the magnitude of the Lorentz-violating couplings ranging
from 1–8 × 10−3 . This is the ﬁrst precision test of the isotropy in special relativity with top quarks at the LHC,
restricting further the bounds on such couplings by up to two orders of magnitude with respect to previous
searches conducted at the Tevatron.

1. Introduction
Lorentz invariance is a key ingredient of the relativistic description
of our world, on the scale of elementary particles as well as on large
scales in the Universe. The standard model (SM) of particle physics
is a relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, and as such it must contain a
Lorentz-invariant action. General relativity preserves Lorentz invariance
locally. The Lorentz group contains rotations and boosts in Minkowski
spacetime. Models of quantum gravity, e.g., string theory [1] and loop
quantum gravity [2], can, however, predict breaking of Lorentz invariance at a high mass scale. A quantum theory including gravity may be
governed by an energy scale lower than the Planck mass, possibly at the
TeV scale [3]. Thus, induced deviations from Lorentz invariance may be
measurable at the LHC.
The standard model extension (SME) [4,5] is an eﬀective ﬁeld theory in which all operators violating Lorentz invariance are added to the
SM Lagrangian. Its coeﬃcients, controlling the size of Lorentz invariance breaking, are diﬀerent for each particle. While coeﬃcients related
to photons, neutrons, protons, and neutrinos have been measured precisely [6], the quark sector remains constrained at a relatively lower
precision. The ZEUS Collaboration at the DESY HERA recently searched
for violation of Lorentz invariance arising from light quarks in deep
inelastic scattering data [7]. Searches for Lorentz invariance violation
were performed in neutral meson mixing at KLOE [8], KTeV [9], FO-

CUS [10], BaBar [11], D0 [12], and LHCb [13]. Violation of Lorentz
invariance was searched for with top quark pairs (tt ) by the D0 experiment [14] at the Fermilab Tevatron, showing compatibility with
Lorentz invariance with an absolute uncertainty of about 10% on the
tested SME
√ coeﬃcients. The proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN
LHC at 𝑠 = 13 TeV produce tt events with a cross section approximately 100 times higher than that of the Tevatron. Studies showed that
the measurements at the LHC have a large potential to signiﬁcantly improve upon existing results [15].
In this Letter, the ﬁrst search for Lorentz invariance violation with
top quarks at the LHC is presented, within the context of the SME.
Signatures for violation of Lorentz invariance involving top quarks are
parameterized with the SME Lagrangian [16]:

transformations of the particle system: they are constant 4×4 matrices,
thereby breaking Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian. They indicate
a preferential direction in spacetime as seen by top quarks, violating
the isotropy of special relativity. Boosts associated with the Earth’s rotation and with the revolution around the sun are negligible relative to

top quark boosts. Lorentz invariance is preserved when 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 are
zero.
Choosing a reference frame is needed to report measurements of
Lorentz-violating coeﬃcients, in analogy, for instance, with the measurement of particle energies, which are not invariant under Lorentz
transformation. By convention, results are reported in the sun-centered
frame (SCF) [6], with its origin at the center of the sun; the 𝑍 axis
pointing north, parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis; the 𝑋 axis pointing
to the intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator on January 1st,
2000 (J2000); and the 𝑌 axis completing the direct basis. The SCF can be
considered as inertial in the lifetime of a physics experiment. Hereafter,
the coeﬃcients 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 with space-time indices 𝜇 or 𝜈 = 𝑇 , 𝑋, 𝑌 , 𝑍
are expressed in the SCF (to be distinguished from the space-time indices
of the CMS frame). The relevant measure of time in this reference frame
is called sidereal time. While one rotation period of the Earth is equal
to approximately 23 h 56 min UTC (i.e., Universal Time Coordinated,
where UTC seconds are deﬁned from Cesium atomic hyperﬁne transitions), one rotation period is deﬁned as being equal to 24 sidereal hours.
The CMS detector moves around the Earth’s rotation axis during a sidereal day, and so does the beam line direction at the interaction point,
or the average direction of top quarks produced in the collisions. As a
consequence, top quark couplings 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 depend on time, resulting in cross sections for top quark production modulating with sidereal
time. Searching for such signatures is the goal of this Letter.
We report a search for violation of
√Lorentz invariance in pp → tt production with the CMS experiment at 𝑠 = 13 TeV, using events with one
muon and one electron of opposite charge in the ﬁnal state, stemming
from the decay tt → bbeνe μνμ (where the particle or antiparticle nature
of the leptons is implied). The eμ channel provides a high purity sample
of tt events owing to the negligible contribution from Z+jets processes.
A data sample recorded in 2016–2017 with the CMS experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 is analyzed. Events
are categorized based on the number of jets identiﬁed as originating
from b quarks (b jets) to improve the separation between the tt signal
and the background processes. The normalized tt cross section is measured diﬀerentially as a function of the sidereal time, in bins of hours
within the sidereal day, by performing a proﬁle maximum likelihood ﬁt
to the event yields in the b jet multiplicity. The measurement is used
to constrain, for the ﬁrst time at the LHC, the Lorentz-violating coeﬃcients 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 impacting top quarks. Tabulated results are provided
in the HEPData record for this analysis [17].
The Letter is organized as follows. A description of the CMS detector and event reconstruction is provided in Section 2. Section 3 gives
details on simulation samples, and Section 4 describes the event selection. Event corrections and associated systematic uncertainties, as well
as their treatment relative to sidereal time, are detailed in Section 5. The
normalized diﬀerential cross section for tt production as a function of
sidereal time is measured in Section 6, providing a model-independent
result. Bounds on the coeﬃcients 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 within the SME framework are extracted in Section 7. The Letter concludes with a Summary
in Section 8.

tion of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables,
can be found in Refs. [18–20].
Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. The
ﬁrst level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at
a rate of around 100 kHz within a ﬁxed latency of about 4 μs [21].
During the 2016–2017 data taking, a gradual shift in the timing of the
inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger in the region at |𝜂| > 2.0, where 𝜂 is the
pseudorapidity, caused a speciﬁc trigger ineﬃciency. Correction factors,
which are small, were computed from data and applied to the simulation. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists
of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate
to around 1 kHz before data storage [22]. Events are selected at the HLT
by requiring the presence of one or two leptons, with transverse momentum (𝑝T ) thresholds as follows: one electron with 𝑝T > 12 GeV and one
muon with 𝑝T > 23 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 23 GeV and one muon
with 𝑝T > 8 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 27 (35) GeV in 2016 (2017);
or one muon with 𝑝T > 24 (27) GeV in 2016 (2017).
The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker.
Electron candidates are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 and 20 GeV for the
highest 𝑝T (leading) and second-highest 𝑝T (subleading) lepton. Furthermore, electrons must have |𝜂| < 2.4, and their energy deposit in
the ECAL must lie outside of the transition region between the barrel
and endcap sections (1.44 < |𝜂| < 1.56). Electron candidates must satisfy
tight identiﬁcation criteria and are required to be isolated in the detector
to reject jets misidentiﬁed as electrons. Identiﬁcation criteria comprise
selections on a shower shape variable in the ECAL, on the matching of
the track with the ECAL energy deposit, on the ratio of HCAL over ECAL
energy deposits around the candidate, the hits in the inner tracker, and
on criteria to reject electrons arising from photon conversions [23]. An
isolation variable is computed with the PF algorithm as the scalar 𝑝T sum
of photons, charged and neutral hadrons √
in a cone around the electron

direction. The cone is deﬁned by Δ𝑅 = (Δ𝜂)2 + (Δ𝜙)2 < 0.3, where
Δ𝜂 and Δ𝜙 are the 𝜂 and azimuthal angle diﬀerences between the PF
particles and the electron, respectively. Contributions to the isolation
sum from other inelastic pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch
crossing (pileup) are corrected using the FastJet estimator [30]. The
relative isolation, calculated as the isolation sum divided by the electron
𝑝T , is used. Diﬀerences in reconstruction and identiﬁcation eﬃciencies
between data and simulation are corrected using Z → e+ e− events with
a “tag-and-probe” method [31].
Muons are measured in the range |𝜂| < 2.4, with detection planes
made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and
resistive-plate chambers. Muon candidates are reconstructed with the PF
algorithm. They are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 (20) GeV for the leading (subleading) lepton. Muon candidates are required to satisfy tight
identiﬁcation and isolation criteria, to suppress contributions from jets
misidentiﬁed as muons. Identiﬁcation criteria include selections on the
number of matched muon detector planes, hits in the pixel and tracker,
the 𝜒 2 of the trajectory ﬁt including tracking layers and muon detector
planes, and the transverse impact parameter of the track [24]. A relative
isolation variable is calculated with the PF algorithm similar to electrons
but with a cone size Δ𝑅 < 0.4. Diﬀerences in identiﬁcation and isolation
eﬃciencies between data and simulation are corrected using Z → μ+ μ−
events with the tag-and-probe method.
Jets are reconstructed from PF candidates, using the anti-𝑘T algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.4 [30,32]. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and
is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5–10% of the true
momentum over the entire 𝑝T spectrum and detector acceptance. To
mitigate pileup contributions, tracks identiﬁed to be originating from
pileup vertices are discarded, and an oﬀset correction is applied to correct for the remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived
from simulation studies so that the average measured energy of jets be-

2. Event reconstruction with the CMS detector
The CMS apparatus [18–20] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic detector, designed to trigger on [21,22] and identify electrons, muons,
photons, and hadrons [23–25]. A global “particle-ﬂow” (PF) algorithm [26] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, combining information provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the
crystal electromagnetic (ECAL) and brass-scintillator hadron (HCAL)
calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with
data from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the ﬂuxreturn yoke outside the solenoid. The reconstructed particles are used
to build τ leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum [27–29]. A
more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a deﬁni2

comes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of
the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events
are used to determine any residual diﬀerences between the jet energy
scale in data and simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [28].
Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by instrumental eﬀects or reconstruction failures.
Jets are selected if they satisfy 𝑝T > 30 GeV and |𝜂| < 2.4. Jets are not
considered if their distance Δ𝑅 from selected leptons is less than 0.4.
For the identiﬁcation of b jets, a loose selection on the score of
the deepCSV algorithm, a deep-learning discriminant using secondary
vertex and lifetime information [33,34], is used. The identiﬁcation eﬃciency of b quark jets is about 84% with a probability of misidentifying
light-quark and gluon jets of 10%, estimated for b jet candidates with
𝑝T > 20 GeV in simulated tt events. Corrections for the diﬀerence in
identiﬁcation eﬃciency of b jets and light jets between data and simulation are computed as a function of the jet 𝑝T and 𝜂 and applied to all
jets in the event.

The CMS detector response is simulated with the Geant4 toolkit
[52]. Data and simulation events are passed through the same CMS software reconstruction chain. Pileup interactions generated with pythia
8 are added to the simulations, and the distribution in the number of
pileup interactions is corrected for each MC sample to reproduce the
numbers observed in data.

3. Simulation samples
Monte Carlo (MC) samples for tt production are generated at next-toleading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)
with the powheg v2 [35] generator, interfaced with pythia 8 [36] for
simulating parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event. Revision 3453 is used for all the MC samples generated with powheg,
while all of the simulation samples use pythia 8.226 (8.230) in 2016
(2017). The tt cross section is computed with the top++ v2.0 program [37] at next-to-NLO (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. It has been observed that the top quark 𝑝T spectrum in
data is softer than the spectrum predicted in simulation [38–40]. Simulated events for tt production are therefore corrected for the ratio of
unfolded tt data over powheg predictions as a function of the top quark
and antiquark 𝑝T at parton level.
Since this analysis targets the tt ﬁnal state with two charged leptons
of diﬀerent ﬂavors and at least one b jet, single top quark production
in association with a W boson (tW) constitutes the main background,
with one lepton each arising from the top quark and associated W boson
decay. Simulated samples of tW and 𝑡-channel single top quark production are generated at NLO in pQCD with powheg v2. The cross section for the tW channel is computed at approximate NNLO [41]. Other
backgrounds involving top quarks include 𝑠-channel single top quark
production and tt production in association with a vector boson (ttW
and ttZ, grouped together and denoted as ttV). Simulated samples for
these processes are generated at NLO with MadGraph5_amc@nlo [42]
(version 2.4.2 in 2016 and 2.6.0 in 2017 in all samples using MadGraph5_amc@nlo) with additional jets using FxFx merging [43]. The
cross sections for single top 𝑡- and 𝑠-channel production are computed with the hathor v2.1 program [44] at NLO accuracy. The cross
sections for ttW and ttZ processes are computed at NLO with MadGraph5_amc@nlo generation [42]. In the simulated samples, a ﬁxed
value of 𝑚t = 172.5 GeV is used. Diboson production samples (WW, WZ,
ZZ) are generated with pythia 8. The cross section for the WW process is computed at NNLO [45], while the WZ and ZZ cross sections
are computed at NLO with mcfm [46] version 6.6. The W+jets and
Z+jets processes (grouped together and denoted as V+jets) are generated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo, at leading order (LO) matched
with additional jets using the MLM algorithm [47] or at NLO with additional jets using FxFx merging. Cross sections for Z+jets and W+jets
processes are computed with fewz [48] version 3.1 at NNLO.
The underlying event is modeled with the CP5 tune [49] for all of the
simulated samples with 2017 detector conditions, and for the simulation
of tt and tW processes with 2016 detector conditions. The samples simulated with 2016 detector conditions are using the CUETP8M1 tune [50]
for all other background processes. The parton distribution functions
(PDFs) used are the NNPDF3.1 NNLO set [51] for samples using the
CP5 tune, and NNPDF3.0 NNLO for samples using the CUETP8M1 tune.

4. Event selection
Events with exactly one electron and one muon are selected. Events
are rejected if there are additional electrons or muons with 𝑝T > 20 GeV.
In addition, the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is required to satisfy
𝑚eμ > 20 GeV, to reduce contributions from low-mass resonances and
Drell–Yan τ pair production. Events with at least two jets are selected,
among which at least one must be identiﬁed as a b jet.
The distribution in the number of b jets is compared between data
and simulation in Fig. 1. The MC simulation of signal and backgrounds
provides a description of the data distribution in the number of b jets
agreeing within uncertainties. Inclusively, the event yields are 7.1%
(2016) and 2.7% (2017) lower in data than in simulation, as shown
in Table 1.
The distribution in the number of b jets is used as discriminant for the
signal extraction in Sections 6 and 7, since it provides clear separation
between the tt signal and the single top quark background, with the
latter having only one top quark decaying to bW, compared to two for
the signal process.
5. Treatment of the sidereal time dependence in corrections and
systematic uncertainties
The CMS data is recorded in UNIX time, whose seconds having the
same duration as UTC seconds. The UNIX timestamp of the events is
translated to sidereal time with the following formula:

Ωsidereal 𝑡sidereal = ΩUTC 𝑡UNIX + 𝜙UNIX + 𝜙longitude ,
= 2𝜋∕86 400 s−1

(2)

where Ωsidereal
(sidereal) is the angular velocity of
Earth’s rotation around its axis in sidereal time, ΩUTC = 2𝜋∕86 164 s−1
(UTC) is the angular velocity of Earth’s rotation around its axis in UTC
time, and 𝑡UNIX represents the event timestamp recorded at CMS in UNIX
time since January 1st, 1970 (UNIX epoch). The azimuthal angle 𝜙UNIX
encodes the phase between the UNIX epoch and J2000, which is the origin of the sidereal time count, and 𝜙longitude is the eﬀective longitude,
deﬁned as the angle between the LHC beam at the CMS interaction point
and the Greenwich meridian in rad.
Data events are classiﬁed in 24 bins, corresponding to the 24 sidereal
hours within a sidereal day. In the MC simulation, event timestamps are
not included; instead, a time-integrated distribution is built and scaled
by 1∕24 to deﬁne the expected prediction in each sidereal hour bin.
This prediction and its associated systematic uncertainties need to be
corrected for eﬀects that would potentially depend on sidereal time.

The CMS Collaboration

independent subdetectors (referred to as luminometers). The normalization, as well as detector-speciﬁc normalization uncertainties are not expected to depend on sidereal time and are treated as uniform. The uncertainties in the time stability and the linearity with respect to pileup, however, are estimated from cross-detector comparisons, i.e., by comparing
the agreement between diﬀerent luminometers, and their dependence
on sidereal time can be evaluated explicitly. In 2016, the three main luminometers and methods used for the luminosity measurement [55] are
the cluster counting in the pixel tracker, an occupancy-based algorithm
using the HCAL measurement, and an LHC radiation monitoring system.
In 2017, the three main luminometers and methods [56] are a method
based on the sum of transverse energy in HCAL towers, pixel detector
cluster counting, and the pixel luminosity telescope [57]. The main luminometers used for the luminosity measurement are not the same at all
times, since the individual luminosity detectors can be aﬀected by various operational issues. A small dependence of the stability and linearity
estimates on the sidereal time is found:
• The cross-detector stability is evaluated separately in each sidereal time bin by taking the maximum diﬀerence among the integrated luminosities estimated with the three main luminometers.
The relative uncertainty is found to be 0.1–0.3 (0.2–0.4)% in 2016
(2017), consistent with the time-integrated uncertainties evaluated
in Refs. [55,56].
• The time dependence of the linearity of the luminometer response
is evaluated in each sidereal time bin by computing the average single-bunch instantaneous luminosity (SBIL), as measured
with the diﬀerent luminometers, and weighting the largest diﬀerence with the corresponding cross-detector linearity slopes from
Refs. [56,55]. The slopes are obtained from a ﬁt of the ratios of SBIL
estimates for pairs of luminometers, as a function of SBIL. The relative uncertainty is found to be at most 0.3 (0.5)% in 2016 (2017),
depending on the sidereal time bin. The 2016 result is in agreement
with the time-integrated uncertainty evaluated in Ref. [55], but the
2017 result is smaller than the uncertainty from Ref. [56] due to
the usage of the less-conservative approach from Ref. [55] for the
evaluation of the 2017 luminosity.
Cross-detector stability and linearity uncertainties are included in the
analysis with explicit dependence on sidereal time. The LHC-related uncertainties (normalization uncertainties related to the van der Meer scan
procedure) are evaluated to be 0.6 (0.9)% in 2016 (2017), and other luminosity uncertainties related to the detector are evaluated to be 0.9
(1.4)% in 2016 (2017).
The trigger eﬃciency, potentially changing slightly over the course
of the year with the instantaneous luminosity proﬁle, might also depend on sidereal time. Simulated events are therefore corrected for the
diﬀerence in the trigger eﬃciency between data and simulation as a
function of sidereal time. The trigger eﬃciencies are measured with the
same method as in Ref. [58], using events triggered with requirements
on the missing transverse momentum 𝑝miss
, which is the magnitude of

vector,
deﬁned
as
the
projection
onto
the plane perpendicular

to the beam axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF
objects in the event, corrected for pileup eﬀects. Events triggered with
𝑝miss
requirements are correlated at less than 1% with those passing
T
single-lepton and dilepton triggers. Events must satisfy a requirement
on reconstructed 𝑝miss
> 100 GeV. At least one jet identiﬁed as b jet is
T
required. For each sidereal time bin, a statistical uncertainty is computed, and two systematic uncertainties are evaluated by repeating the
measurement in subpartitions of the data: an uncertainty for the dependence of the trigger eﬃciency on the number of jets and on the period
of data taking. The ratio of trigger eﬃciencies in data and simulation is
found to be in a range 97–99%, with uncertainties at the level of 1%,
depending on the sidereal time bin.
For other experimental corrections and uncertainties, the dependence on sidereal time is unknown. As a consequence, an individual

event selection, (upper) in 2016 and (lower) in 2017 samples. The hatched band
includes statistical and systematic uncertainties in the predictions. The vertical
bars associated with the data points represent their statistical uncertainty. The
lower panels show the ratio of the observed data event yields to those expected
from simulation.

According to the deﬁnition of sidereal time, events recorded every day
within a year at the same UTC time would populate the bins uniformly.
The instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC, and thus the distribution of the number of pileup interactions per bunch crossing evolves
over the year. To allow for diﬀerences in the instantaneous luminosity
proﬁle between sidereal time bins, the distribution in the number of
pileup interactions in simulation is corrected to agree with data, as a
function of the sidereal hour within a day. The associated uncertainty
arises from our imprecise knowledge of the total inelastic cross section,
and is computed by varying this cross section by its uncertainty (4.6%)
simultaneously in each sidereal time bin.
The recorded integrated luminosity per sidereal time bin varies by
up to 25% within a sidereal day, reﬂecting the time structure of the LHC
operations. The simulated events are corrected to match the integrated
luminosity in each sidereal time bin. The uncertainty in the integrated
luminosity measurement originates from various sources in the normalization (related to the van der Meer calibration procedure [53–55]) and
the integration of the luminosity measurement performed with several

The CMS Collaboration

nuisance parameter per sidereal time bin is conservatively attributed
to most of the other experimental uncertainties, whose size is evaluated from an estimate not depending on time, allowing the ﬁt to accommodate possible time dependence. These experimental uncertainties
include the following sources: ratios of eﬃciencies between data and
simulation for electron and muon reconstruction, identiﬁcation, and
isolation that arise from tag-and-probe measurements with Z → 𝓁 + 𝓁 −
events [23,24] (where 𝓁 = e or μ; uncertainties associated with the jet
energy corrections (including jet energy resolution) [28]; uncertainties
arising from the identiﬁcation of b jets [33]; and uncertainties associated
with the gradual shift in the timing of the inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger.
All of these uncertainties are treated as impacting the shape of the number of b jets distribution, as well as its normalization, and are treated
as uncorrelated across sidereal time. Where relevant, each uncertainty
source is split into systematic uncertainties correlated year-to-year, and
a year-to-year uncorrelated component essentially of statistical nature.
Two additional sources of theoretical origin impact experimental quantities and are treated as correlated as functions of sidereal time and years:
the uncertainty in the jet energy scale arising from the parton ﬂavors,
obtained by comparing herwig and pythia simulation; and the uncertainty in lepton isolation arising from the phase space extrapolation of
eﬃciencies, from Z → 𝓁 + 𝓁 − to tt events. The uncertainties inducing the
largest impact on the distribution of the number of b jets for the tt process are the electron identiﬁcation (1.2% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017)
and b jet identiﬁcation uncertainty (2% at low number of jets to 5% at
high number of jets).
Contributions from background processes are estimated from simulation. After the selection, the event yield for background processes is
about 8% of the total number of expected events (Table 1), dominated
by single top quark processes. The normalization of single top quark
processes, whose contribution is dominated by the tW process, is assigned an uncertainty of 30%, accounting for the interference with the
tt process in the selected phase space. Diboson and V+jets processes
are attributed an uncertainty of 30% as well estimated for the predictions in the selected phase-space. All these uncertainties are estimated
following the prescription from Ref. [59]. An uncertainty of 20% is associated with ttV processes [60]. A normalization uncertainty of 4% is
assigned to the SM tt process [59] in the SME ﬁt (Section 7).
The uncertainty corresponding to the correction of the top quark
𝑝T in the tt process is estimated by the diﬀerence with respect to not
applying the correction (signatures for violation of Lorentz invariance
searched for in this Letter cannot induce a modiﬁcation of the top quark
and antiquark 𝑝T , once integrated over time). Other theoretical uncertainties are arising from the top quark mass (obtained by varying 𝑚t by
1 GeV up and down around its nominal value); from the parameter ℎdamp
controlling the matching between matrix element and parton shower in
the powheg generator (varied around its nominal value as 1.379+0.926
−0.505
times 𝑚t ); uncertainties associated with the CP5 underlying event tune
(estimated during the tuning process [49]); and color reconnection uncertainties in the parton shower. Uncertainties in the parton shower
modeling, related to initial- and ﬁnal-state radiation, are included for
tt and single top quark processes by varying the renormalization scale
for initial- and ﬁnal-state QCD emission in the parton shower by a factor 2 up and down. Uncertainties arising from our missing knowledge of
higher-order corrections in pQCD are included separately for tt , single
top quark, ttV, and V+jets processes by constructing an envelope of
maximum variation computed from renormalization and factorization
scale varied by a factor 1/2 to 2, excluding anticorrelated variations.
Uncertainties in the PDFs and the strong coupling constant 𝛼S are evaluated with the Hessian set of NNPDF3.1 (102 replicas) and added in
quadrature, with a single nuisance parameter for tt , single top quark,
ttV, and V+jets processes. The ℎdamp , CP5 tune, and color reconnection sources modify the normalization of the distribution in the number
of b jets, while all the other theoretical uncertainties modify the shape
of the distribution. Theoretical uncertainties related to SM predictions
are uniform across sidereal time.

A theoretical uncertainty corresponding to single top quark time
modulation in the SME is included in the SME ﬁt (described in Section 7), and treated as correlated across sidereal time.
The same MC samples are used to predict the event yields in each
sidereal time bin, separately for 2016 and 2017. Statistical uncertainties in the MC samples are included as log-normal uncertainties independently for each bin of the b jet multiplicity distribution, treated as
correlated across sidereal time bins.
The assumed correlations of the uncertainties between years of data
taking and sidereal time bins are detailed in Table 2.
6. Measurement of the normalized 𝐭𝐭 diﬀerential cross section
with sidereal time
The normalized diﬀerential cross section for tt production is measured by employing a proﬁle likelihood template ﬁt of the predictions
from simulation to the data including all sidereal time bins, based on
the LHC test statistic [61–63]. Since the SM predictions for the tt cross
section are identical in each particle-level bin 𝑖, and because unfolding
for detector eﬀects is not needed (particle- and reconstructed-level sidereal time are identical), the normalized diﬀerential cross section 𝜎𝑖 ∕𝜎avg
in bin 𝑖 (where 𝜎avg is the averaged cross section over all sidereal time
bins) reduces to 𝜇𝑖 ∕𝜇avg , where 𝜇𝑖 is the ratio of the observed tt yield

∑

to the tt yield predicted in the SM, and 𝜇avg = 𝑘 𝜇𝑘 ∕24. The fractions
𝑓𝑖 = 𝜇𝑖 ∕𝜇avg for 23 sidereal time bins are directly ﬁtted as parameters of
interest together with 𝜇avg ; the remaining fraction and its uncertainty is
computed via error propagation using the covariance matrix of the ﬁt.
In performing the measurement of the tt normalized diﬀerential
cross section as a function of sidereal time, the distributions in the number of b jets in each sidereal time bin are used as discriminant observables between tt and background processes. Uncertainties described in
Section 5 are considered either as nuisance parameters with log-normal
distribution attributed to the normalization of the distribution in the
number of b jets, or as nuisance parameters distorting the shape of the
distribution in the number of b jets. Uncertainties follow the correlation scheme highlighted in Table 2: when the dependency with sidereal
time is known, the uncertainties are treated as correlated across sidereal time bin (including uniform theory and background normalization
uncertainties); and when the dependency is not known, the uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated across sidereal time bin. Preﬁt and postﬁt
distributions are illustrated in Fig. 2. The preﬁt distribution corresponds
to the expected SM event yields and their uncertainties before the ﬁt is
performed. After the model is ﬁtted to the data, the ﬁnal values of the
parameters and their uncertainties are obtained, corresponding to the
postﬁt distribution. The predicted distributions of the number of b jets
are not the same in each time bin, because corrections for integrated
luminosity, pileup, and trigger eﬃciencies are applied as a function of
sidereal time.
The normalized diﬀerential cross section is shown in Fig. 3. A
goodness-of-ﬁt test including constraints from the nuisance parameters [64] results in a 𝑝-value [65] of 0.92 for the adequacy of the MC
model to describe data.
Fig. 4 shows a breakdown of the uncertainties associated with the
measurement of tt normalized diﬀerential cross section, according to
the treatment of their dependences on sidereal time. The measurement is
dominated by systematic uncertainties. The experimental uncertainties
that are treated as uncorrelated in sidereal time have the largest impact on the normalized diﬀerential cross section, and they arise mainly
from sources related to electrons, jet energy scale, and b tagging. The
uncertainties featuring explicit dependence on sidereal time have an impact that is smaller than the statistical uncertainty, and are dominated
by trigger uncertainties. Uncertainties that are uniform in sidereal time
(ﬂat luminosity component, background normalization, theory uncertainties) contribute to a lesser extent.

cavern, has an angle of 𝛾 = 0.705◦ relative to the surface.
A tt production sample, generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo at
LO in pQCD with parton shower, underlying event, and hadronization
simulated with pythia 8, followed by full detector simulation, is used
to evaluate the signal 𝑓 (𝑡) functions. The 𝑓 (𝑡) functions are computed
for each number of reconstructed b jets separately for each year and
sidereal time bin. Events containing exactly 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 b jets at the
reconstructed level are used to evaluate the matrix elements 𝑃 , 𝐹 , 𝐹̄
and their SME corrections, using exact LO kinematics before showering.
The SME coeﬃcients are classiﬁed into four families extracted separately, corresponding to 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 (assuming
𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 = 0), and 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 = 0). Within
the chosen basis of coeﬃcients adopted in the SME, these matrices are
deﬁned as symmetric and traceless. Coeﬃcients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑇 𝑇
induce a shift in the tt cross section and are not considered. Since the
𝑍 -axis is deﬁned as the Earth’s rotation axis, and because modulation
of the tt cross section with sidereal time is induced by rotation around
this axis, there is by deﬁnition no sensitivity in the coeﬃcients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑍 . For similar reasons, coeﬃcients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑇
are not considered. Coeﬃcients with 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑋𝑇 or 𝑌 𝑇 are found to induce very small SME corrections and are also not considered. Remaining
coeﬃcients correspond to the combinations 𝑐𝑋𝑋 = −𝑐𝑌 𝑌 , 𝑐𝑋𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑋 ,
𝑐𝑌 𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑌 , and 𝑐𝑋𝑌 = 𝑐𝑌 𝑋 (and similar expressions for the three other
scenarios). A total of 16 sets of coeﬃcients is determined. An illustration
of their impact on the tt cross section is shown in Fig. 5.

7. Testing Lorentz invariance with the SME
Corrections to the matrix element of tt production and decay arising
from Lorentz-violating terms in the SME are known at LO in pQCD [16],
and are linear in the SME coeﬃcients, stemming from the interference
between SME and SM predictions. Within the CMS reference frame, the
variation of the tt cross section with sidereal time 𝑡 is quantiﬁed with
the function [14] 𝑓 (𝑡) = 𝜎SME (𝑡)∕𝜎SM − 1, where 𝜎SME (𝜎SM ) are the
values predicted in the SME (SM):

with 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 + 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 and 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐 𝜇𝜈 − 𝑑 𝜇𝜈 ; where 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent
summation over space-time indices in the CMS detector frame; 𝑃 , 𝐹 ,
and 𝐹̄ are the squared LO matrix elements of the SM tt production (either quark-antiquark annihilation or gluon fusion), and top quark and
antiquark decays; and 𝛿𝑃 , 𝛿𝐹 , 𝛿 𝐹̄ are their corrections predicted in the
SME. Rotation matrices 𝑅(𝑡) represent transformations of observer coordinates from the SCF to the CMS reference frame, depending on the
Earth’s rotation around its axis with angular velocity Ωsidereal . The coordinates of the CMS interaction point are speciﬁed [66] by the azimuth
on the LHC ring (𝜙 = 101.28◦ ), the latitude (𝜆 = 46.31◦ N), and the lon6

and systematic uncertainty predicted in each bin, including correlations across bins. The vertical bars associated with the data points represent their statistical
uncertainty. The lower panels show the ratio of the observed data event yields to those expected from simulation.

The Lagrangian deﬁned in Eq. (1) impacts all processes involving
top quarks, including single top quark and ttV processes. The latter processes have a small yield and their variation with sidereal time can be
neglected, contrary to the former processes. Expressions for the matrix
elements of single top quark production in the SME are not available,
to our knowledge. Among the single top quark processes, tW production has the largest contribution in the selected dileptonic event sample.
Therefore, uncertainties corresponding to single top quark time modulation in the SME are attributed to single top quark processes, and
computed from matrix elements predicted in the SME for top quark and
antiquark decay only, in an MC sample of tW processes generated at
LO. These uncertainties correspond to a value of the SME coeﬃcients
of ±3 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑋𝑌 directions, and ±10 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑍 and
𝑌 𝑍 directions, at the same order of magnitude as the expected sensitivity in the worst case among 𝑐𝐿 , 𝑐𝑅 , 𝑐 , and 𝑑 sets of coeﬃcients. In
the case of 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 coeﬃcients, which do not aﬀect the top quark or antiquark in the decay (as highlighted in Eq. (3)), the uncertainty model for
𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 is used. In measuring individually the SME coeﬃcients, the SME
uncertainty for single top quark processes in a given direction has been

with zero, in agreement with the SM within one standard deviation or
less, indicating no sign of deviation from Lorentz invariance. The precision achieved on the values of the coeﬃcients of the 𝑐𝐿 and 𝑐𝑅 families
on the one hand, and on the values of the coeﬃcients of the 𝑑 family
on the other hand, is improved respectively by a factor 20–50 and up to
100 over the previous constraints [14]. The coeﬃcients of the 𝑐 family
are measured for the ﬁrst time.
The impact of the uncertainties in the SME coeﬃcients is shown in
Fig. 7 in the case of the ﬁt of individual sets of coeﬃcients, while the
coeﬃcients corresponding to the three other directions are left ﬂoating.
Systematic uncertainties uncorrelated between sidereal time bins are
dominating the precision, at a level of approximately three times higher
than the statistical uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties that are
nonuniform and correlated across sidereal time impact the precision at
about half the impact of the statistical uncertainties. The uncertainties
that are uniform in sidereal time have a smaller impact.

Fig. 4. Comparison of systematic and statistical uncertainties, where the former are grouped according to the treatment of time dependence: uniform (ﬂat
luminosity component, background normalization, theory), correlated (trigger,
luminosity stability and linearity, pileup, and MC statistical uncertainty), or uncorrelated (other experimental uncertainties) across sidereal time bins.

8. Summary
A search for violation of Lorentz invariance has been performed using top quark pairs (tt ), requiring the presence of one muon and one
electron in the events. Data collected in 2016–2017 with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 are used.
A measurement of the tt normalized diﬀerential cross section as a function of sidereal time is performed. The Lorentz invariance assumption is
tested by measuring 16 sets of coeﬃcients within the standard model extension, an eﬀective ﬁeld theory predicting a modulation of the tt cross
section with sidereal time. Measurements of the Lorentz-violating couplings are found to be compatible with the standard model hypothesis.
The precision of the results ranges from less than 1 × 10−3 to 8 × 10−3
for the measured coeﬃcients. This constitutes the most precise test of
the isotropy in special relativity using top quarks at a hadron collider.

veriﬁed to impact only the coeﬃcients related to the same direction,
with an uncertainty corresponding to approximately 15% of the total
uncertainty on the coeﬃcient.
The discriminant observable used to extract the SME coeﬃcients is
the same as in the diﬀerential measurement (Section 6), with event
corrections and systematic uncertainties described in Section 5. The likelihood ﬁt is performed in two scenarios: 1) independently for each set
of coeﬃcients as a single parameter of interest, with all other parameters being set to zero; 2) independently for each set of coeﬃcients as a
single parameter of interest, with the parameters corresponding to the
three other directions (among 𝑋𝑋 , 𝑋𝑌 , 𝑋𝑍 , 𝑌 𝑍 directions) ﬂoating
in the ﬁt, for the four families of coeﬃcients 𝑐𝐿 , 𝑐𝑅 , 𝑐 , and 𝑑 separately.
The measured values of the SME sets of coeﬃcients in the latter scenario is shown in Fig. 6, while Table 3 compares the values for the two
scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 yield expected uncertainties identical up to
the second digit, because the correlation between the four sets of coeﬃcients in a family is found to be 0–4%. A 𝑝-value of 0.98 is obtained for
the measurements of the coeﬃcients in a given direction while the coeﬃcients corresponding to the three other directions are ﬂoating in the
ﬁt. All of the measured values for the SME coeﬃcients are compatible

Fig. 7. Uncertainty breakdown for SME ﬁts of single coeﬃcients while the coefﬁcients corresponding to the three other directions are left ﬂoating, by splitting
according to the treatment of time dependence: ﬂat across sidereal time (ﬂat luminosity component, background normalization, theory), correlated in sidereal
time bins (trigger, luminosity stability and linearity, pileup, MC statistical uncertainty, single top quark decay in the SME), systematics uncorrelated in sidereal
time bins (other experimental uncertainties), and statistical uncertainty.
