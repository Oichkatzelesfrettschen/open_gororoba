It's the woes of our world. Just stars, all cold, distant, pretty much the same, right? Well, actually, no. Of course, stars come in a variety of sizes, densities, compositions, displaying unique characteristics and behaviours. You have high bajias, you've got dwarves, red dwarfs, white dwarfs, and then you've got exotic stars. The most intriguing, the most alluring. Because you're see, astrophysicists have theorized their existence and have good reason to believe that they are actually up there. But observing 1 is incredibly challenging, so much so that they remain hypothetical to this day. Or do they? One type of such exotic object is the fantastically named quark star, and after 60 years since they were first theorized, we might be getting close to confirming their existence. All right, before we tackle the question of what is a quark star, let's address the basics of, well, what is a quark? Quarks are fundamental subatomic particles observed in pairs or triplets bound together by the strong force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, alongside with gravity, electromagnetism and weak force. The athlete name strong force is the strongest of the four, and when it binds 3 quarks together we get hadrons, IE the subatomic particles found in the nuclei of atoms, protons and neutrons. As such, quarks belong to one of two fundamental blogs in our universe, bosons, which comprise photons, and fermions, which include electrons and odd new friends, the quarks, which are not all equal. According to Swinburne University's Encyclopedia of Astronomy, quarks come in six flavors or species, with the rather poetic names up, down, charm, Strange, top and bottom. But what really matters to us is that quark stars are stars consisting of three quarks. So well then, done. Thanks for watching. All right, all right, not so fast, because things are actually a teeny tiny bit more complicated. Now, the thing about quark stars is that they have remains largely theoretical and only possibly, just possibly observed until very recently, but we will get there. The existence of quark stars was first hypothesized in 1965 by Soviet physicist Dmitri Ivan Echo and Dmitri Kerr. The two Dimitris posited the existence of such objects as stars with an intermediate density between a neutron star and a black hole. A neutron star forms when stars with higher mass than our sun go out with a bang, as in a supernova explosion. It's a Big Bang, but not that Big Bang. The remaining core has such high density and strong gravity that it collapses onto itself with its constituent atoms compressed together under unbelievable pressure. The pressure crushes together protons and electrons, thus resulting in a a soup of only neutrons. These stars are relatively small in size, with an average diameter of only about 19 kilometres, which is about five times the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You know, Speaking of stars and all that, but they are also incredibly dense, boasting a mass up to twice that of our Sun. So dense, in fact, that if you were to plug a single teaspoon of matter out of a neutron star, it would weigh 10 million tons. Now, when such a star surpasses a certain critical mass, gravitational pressure crushes its neutrons and the entire celestial object collapses into a black hole, even smaller, much denser, and exerting even more gravity. But what if there was an intermediate stage, A stage in which gravitational forces breakdown neutrons, releasing the triplets of quarks which constitute them? The Super neutrons would become a broth of quarks, and well, that's it. That's a quark star. Hypothetically, quarks which compose each neutron might even merge with each other, creating so-called strange quarks. These particles might constitute the building block of another variety of exotic star, strange quark stars, or simply strange stars. Astronomers firmly believe that quark stars do exist, but they admit that spotting 1 is incredibly complicated. For starters, as they are an intermediate step between the neutron star and the black hole, they probably don't last very long. And even if we have and all the Hubbles and James Webb space telescopes of the cosmos constantly looking for them, it would still be hard to spot them, according to Paul Sartre, astrophysicist at Ohio State University. From the outside and from far away, are you from Earth? A quark star would look pretty much like a neutron star, a massive compact object spewing radiation and hosting crazy strong magnetic fields. There might be some tiny, nearly inscrutable differences in their electromagnetic signature, but nothing that's easy to detect. Telling apart the two varieties is made even more complicated by the fact that cork stars have a knack for role-playing. According to Fred Alan Weber, theoretical physicist at San Diego State University in California, cork stars could come into two main structural varieties, bare and dressed. Bare quark stars are composed entirely of strange quarks, including their surface. On the other hand, the dressed variety is indicingly covered in a thin crust made of nuclear matter diet hadrons found in the nuclei of atoms. This latter type shares many properties with neutron stars because of this crust, which would make it very difficult to distinguish between these types of objects. Are we observing a plain garden variety neutron star, or is it actually an exotic quark star in fancy dress? Fortunately, there are other characteristics unique to quark stars which may help in their identification. First, we have size. Our quirky, quirky friends should be smaller in size compared to neutron stars, with the diameter averaging at 16 kilometers. That's four times the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You're welcome. And we have mass. The mass range for neutron star is between .1 and two times the mass of our Sun. On the other hand, quark stars may have no minimum mass. This doesn't mean that they're expected to be light as a feather. On the contrary, their maximum mass may extend to as much as 2.5 times the mass of the Sun. In other words, there is an overlap in the mass ranges between these objects, but a body with a mass lower than 0.1 and higher than two might make for a potential candidate for a quark star. Another differentiating aspect is the volume to mass ratio. In neutron stars, the volume decreases as mass increases, the smaller the denser. While bare quark stars specifically are expected to display the opposite, as their volume increases, so does their mass. Next we have rotation rates. As quark stars are expected to sustain a staggeringly fast rotation, Let's take a neutron star and a quark star of equal mass and challenge them to complete a full rotation. Due to its smaller size, the quark star will complete a in 80% of the time required by the neutron star. All these elements make for a rather complete identicate, one that could be used by researchers to finally identify their first confirmed quark star. But the road of science is long, it's winding, and it's got oh so many bumps. In April 2002, observers working with the Chandra X-ray Observatory took a closer look at an old acquaintance and made a staggering discovery. Their old pal was RJ XJ185635-375. Great name. Now look, we apologise to all the experts in the field, but please just allow us to call her Roxanne. So up until then, Roxanne held the claim of being the closest neutron star to our planet, at a relatively short distance of 150 light years. Observations conducted in April 2002 revealed that Roxanne shone at a much larger distance from Earth. It's about 450 light years. The Chandra Observatory also took a temperature reading, estimating it at 700,000°C. Finally, Roxanne's amateur appeared to be between 4:00 and 8:00 kilometers, too small to be a neutron star. NASA thus organized a press briefing in Washington announcing that the Chandra staff may have found the first observed quark. *1 year later, the Chandra team struck again, conducting observations on 3C58. Or to us. Let's call this one Tracy, because why not? Tracy appeared to shine at a distance of 10,000 light years away from Earth in the constellation Cassia Pia. She was believed to be a neutron star born following a supernova explosion documented by Chinese and Japanese astronomers in August 1181. In April 2003, Chandra observers worked out that Tracy had cooled down at a faster rate compared to what is expected from a neutron star. There's no offense to Tracy here, but she appeared 16 times as dim as a neutron star. Was Tracy another possible candidate for a quark star then? Well, unfortunately we got a report that the Chandra astronomers had to re cork their champagne bottles on both occasions. In June 2004, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, in cooperation with a Hubble telescope, conducted an in depth analysis of Roxanne. The second set of observations has reported a much lower temperature, only 434,000°C and a large diameter at 14 kilometres. The last both features excluded Roxanne from being a quark star candidate. Tracy was to experience a similar fate. She was conclusively categorized as a pulsar, a type of neutron star. Other close calls followed throughout the 2000s. At least two, According to a report published by Cornell University, XDEJ E1739285 and PSRBO 943 + 10 were first hailed as possible quark stars before observations confirm their status as being a neutron star and a pulsar respectively. Scientists who stare into the dark pit of the cosmos for a living surely do not lack in the patience and determination departments, and years later, more candidates were identified. On August the 14th, 2019, the LIGO observatory detected a new gravitational wave signal or GW with promising potential to clarify. LIGO stands for Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. It's operated by Caltech and MIT, who described it as quoting here. World's largest gravitational wave observatory and a marvel of precision engineering. LIGO exploits the physical properties of light and of space itself to detect and understand the origins of gravitational waves. So it's pretty reliable. Well, this new GW signal, dubbed GW19 O 814, was believed to have originated from a black hole and a nearby object described as a low mass companion. So we're going to call this one Elma. So Elma became the object of a study conducted by Zhang Zhao, astrophysicist at from the Dutch Institute for scientific Space Research. The results were published in September 2022 under the title GW19-O814. Circumstantial evidence for up down quark star Zheng Zhao and team sought to quote investigate the possibility that the low mass companion of the black hole in the source of GW nineteen O 814 was a strange quark star. This possibility is viable within the so-called 2 family scenario in which neutron stars and strange quark coexist. Without going into the details of their paper, which would would be beyond our grasp in any case, I reached the following conclusion. Our results thus provide circumstantial evidence suggesting the recently reported GW nineteen O 814 secondary component could be an up down quark * Autumn 2022 made for a fine vintage when it comes to quark star research. In October of that year, a research team led by Viktor Doroshenko, University of Toboggan in Germany, I reported the discovery of a neutron star with mass well below the theoretical lower limit. The object was located at a distance of 8150 light years away from at the center of a supernova remnant labeled HESK J1731347. Let's just call her Hesse, shall we? That one was easy. Doroshenko and his team analyzed data on Hesse collected via the Gaia Space Observatory and the XMM Newton X-ray Space Telescope, and we're able to determine her diameter, mass, and thermal emission spectrum. Now. Hesse displayed a diameter of 20.8 kilometers, which is pretty close to the average measurement for a neutron star of 19 kilometers. The service temperature was a toasty 2,000,000°C, also within range for this type of object. But when it came to mass, the toboggan team were puzzled. Hesse was only as massive as 77% of the Sun, far lower than the theoretical lower limit for a neutron star. Viktor Doroshenko and friends acknowledged that previous descriptions of what a neutron star should be like might actually be wrong. Perhaps it was time to revise the theoretical mass ranges for neutron stars. But they also acknowledged another explanation. Hesse was in fact a quark star born out of the remnant of a supernova. Hesse proved quite popular with experts not only in Germany but also in Italy. Researcher Francesco de Clemente and his team at the University of Ferrara published a follow up study on May the 30th, 2024 titled In the Compact Orbit Associated with Hesse J1731347-A Strange Quark Star, a possible astrophysical scenario for its formation. Deep breath. De Clemente and his team honed in on the curious case of Hesse's mass smaller than the Sun's. According to them, the analysis of supernova explosions indicate that quote is not possible to produce a neutron star with a mass smaller than about 1.17 MMM being the mass of the Sun here. This fact quoting again raises the question of which astrophysical process could lead to such a small mass. Through their study, the team at Ferrari University showed that a mass equal or smaller to 1 solar masses may be consistent with a strange quark star. Thus, they concluded that quark stars can successfully explain the properties of a few compact objects, and in particular the central objects in Hesse. J 1731, 347. We've also shown that neutron stars can coexist with quark stars. All right, now be fantastic to declare, case closed and confirmed with 100% certainty that objects such as Elmer and Hesse are indeed quark stars. But the beauty of scientific discovery is that it always leaves the door open to being refuted. All the candidates identified in the early 2000s turned out to be neutron stars or pulsars, and future observations may produce a similar verdict for our most recent friends. At this stage, 1 might wonder, but why is it so important to observe and study a confirmed quark star? Well, for starters, quark stars could help us solve the puzzling mystery of gamma ray bursts, or GRBS, and what powers them. Gamma ray light is the most energetic form of light in the universe. As the name suggests, GRBS are short, incredibly intense bursts of such light, lasting from just a few milliseconds to some few minutes. These bursts can shine hundreds of times brighter than a supernova, which is to say that there are about 1,000,000 trillion times brighter than our Sun, so quite bright. So what could possibly generate such incredible levels of energy? Well, as it turns out, if quark stars were proved conclusively to exist, they would make for a fantastic inner engine for GRBS as early as January 2002. Richard and Francesco Sanino at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen published a model for gamma ray bursts inner engine based on quark stars. According to their model, the service of quark stars may play backdrops of the generation of particles described as light glue balls or LGBS. LGBS are composed of three gluons. These are subatomic particles which bind quarks together into hadrons. When these new particles decay, they contribute to the generation of a fireball, which in turn ignites the gamma ray burst. According to Oyed and Sanino, the model is capable of reproducing crucial features of gamma ray bursts, such as the episodic activity of the engine professor. We had expanded upon his research at Calgary University, publishing in June 2019 a unifying model for long duration gamma ray bursts. This time, the research proposed that long duration bursts, or LGRBS, may be explained by a quark Nova, defined as the violent explosion resulting from the conversion of a neutron star quart quark matter through a process known as quark deconfinement. The result is a star made entirely of quarks. As such, quark novas would be able to release huge amounts of energy. Professor Uyed and Calgary University's Quark Nova Project have estimated that the conversion from neutron star to quark star may release 10 to the power of 47 joules of energy. That number is A1, followed by 47 zeros. It looks like this. We'll show it on screen. It's a lot of zeros. For context, the energy released by the Soviet weapon the SAR bomber owes 210 petajoules, which is 210, followed by 15 zeros. OK, so look, we're talking about numbers so big they probably don't even have a name. And the process of a quark star being born might generate these incomprehensible amounts of energy, which may explain the mystery behind the largest explosions taking place in the universe, from GRBS to super luminous supernova. By being able to observe an actual quark star to better understand this destructive power would be enough to justify continuing research. But there's more to the universe than just destruction, and quark stars may actually hold secrets about the origin of the cosmos. In the phase immediately after The Big Bang, the universe was filled with quarks floating around in a broth heated at a sizzling 1 trillion°C. So direct study of confirmed quark stars would help astrophysicists and cosmologists better understand our universe's origin story, including how the early building blocks of matter first came together. Quark stars would make for a fantastic astrophysical laboratory. They would allow us to discover properties matter in a way that is simply not accessible to the Large Hadron Collider or other similar facilities. According to a Friddling Weather, studying quark stars would put researchers quote in the domain of high densities and low temperatures. This is a regime that is only accessible to stars, and only stars can tell us what will happen.","provider":{"id":"AA1BiRzk","name":"Celestium","companyLegalName":"Wild

stars were once thought to be the densest objects nature could create—but some physicists believe there’s a step beyond. Quark stars are hypothetical objects so dense that neutrons themselves break apart into free quarks, forming an entirely new state of matter. Recent observations of ultra-dense stellar remnants have reignited debate over whether these exotic stars might actually exist. If confirmed, quark stars would force scientists to rethink how matter behaves at the absolute limits of the universe.\",\"CreatedOn\":\"2026-02-10T14:05:23Z\",\"CreatedOnUTC\":null,\"ExpirationDate\":\"\",\"ImageHeight\":1080,\"ImageWidth\":1920,\"FocalRegion\":null,\"ImageUrlVNext\":\"https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1W3KZ4.img\",\"ImageHeightVNext\":0,\"ImageWidthVNext\":0,\"TypeVNext\":\"Card\",\"Market\":null,\"ImageCarousel\":[],\"ImageCarouselVNext\":[],\"ImageEncodingFormat\":null,\"ImageGoBigSignal\":null,\"Video\":null}","isLocalNews":"0","financeMetadata":"eyJTdG9ja3MiOltdLCJTZW50aW1lbnRSYXRpbmdzIjpbeyJUb3BpYyI6IndmX3NlbnRpbWVudF9wb3NpdGl2ZSIsIlNjb3JlIjo5NzIxfSx7IlRvcGljIjoid2Zfc2VudGltZW50X25lZ2F0aXZlIiwiU2NvcmUiOjEyNH0seyJUb3BpYyI6IndmX3NlbnRpbWVudF9uZXV0cmFsIiwiU2NvcmUiOjE1NH1dLCJDYXRlZ29yaWVzIjpbXX0=","colorSampling":"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","numberMap":"{}"},"scoredCategories":{"intlv3_stars":901,"intlv3_physics":874,"intlv3_astrophysics":846,"intlv3_particle_physics":612,"intlv3_neutrons":582,"intlv3_astronomy":504,"intlv3_neutron_stars":498,"intlv3_cosmology":258,"intlv3_science":219,"intlv3_the_universe":203,"intlv3tier1_science":657,"intlv3tier1_technology":174,"intlv3tier1_lifestyle":75,"intlv3tier2_smart-living":120,"intlv3tier2_home":96,"intlv3tier2_finance-technology":82,"intlv3tier2_asia-news":68,"intlv3tier2_kids":49,"intlv3tier2_news-photos":48,"intlv3tier2_world":40,"intlv3tier2_uk-news":28,"intlv3tier2_in-depth":24,"intlv3tier2_history":20,"terav2_astrophysics":974,"terav2_quantum_mechanics":922,"terav2_nuclear_physics":906,"terav2_astronomy":904,"terav2_science":863,"terav2_physics":805,"terav2_science_fiction":736,"terav2_cosmology":704,"terav2_technology":613,"terav2_astronomers":542,"terav2_galaxies":500,"terat1_science":933,"terat2_physics":942,"terat2_astronomy":858,"terat2_biology":632,"terat2_chemistry":614,"terat3_astrophysics":975,"terat3_quantum_mechanics":743,"terat3_cosmology":718},"_t":"ContentView","colorSamples":[{"isDarkMode":true,"hexColor":"#3A3124","isGreyScale":false},{"isDarkMode":false,"hexColor":"#FCF8EE","isGreyScale":false}]}
