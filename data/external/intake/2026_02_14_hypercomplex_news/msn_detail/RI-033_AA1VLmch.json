Instead of acting as separate particles, this nanoparticle moved in a shared quantum state, creating a record-setting superposition that blurs the line between microscopic physics and the world we inhabit. The result pushes long standing thought experiments about quantum reality toward something that can be built, measured and, eventually, used.</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/livescience/posts/researchers-have-demonstrated-that-a-nanoparticle-of-7000-sodium-atoms-can-act-a/1265936752063029/#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20demonstrated%20that%20a,They%20aren't%20even%20close.\" rel=\"noopener\">merging</a> thousands of atoms into one coordinated wave, physicists are not only testing the limits of quantum theory but also probing why tables, cats and people do not shimmer through multiple realities at once. The experiment hints that the rules that govern electrons and photons still apply as objects grow larger, and that the barrier between quantum strangeness and classical solidity is thinner than it appears.</p> <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From single particles to a 7,000 atom wave</h2> <p>For more than a century, quantum physics has described how subatomic particles such as electrons and photons behave both like particles and waves, a framework that grew from the work of figures including Max Planck, Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr and is now summarized in modern accounts of <a href=\"https://principia.es/en/quantum-physics-curiosity-and-perplexity/#:~:text=Quantum%20physics%20studies%20the%20behaviour%20of%20subatomic,Planck%2C%20Albert%20Einstein%2C%20Niels%20Bohr%2C%20and%20others.\" rel=\"noopener\">Quantum</a> theory. Classic double slit experiments showed that when particles pass through two openings, they can interfere with themselves like ripples on water, a result that later work extended to electrons and other matter, where, as one overview notes, <a href=\"https://biomedres.us/fulltexts/BJSTR.MS.ID.004639.php#:~:text=Then%20the%20experiment%20with%20a%20double%20gap,but%20these%20particles%20can%20behave%20like%20waves.\" rel=\"noopener\">Then the</a> same entity can behave like a wave or a localized impact depending on how it is observed. That duality underpins everything from semiconductor design to medical imaging, yet it usually plays out at scales far removed from human experience.</p> <p>In the new work, Researchers have taken a dramatic step toward closing that gap by showing that a nanoparticle made of 7,000 sodium atoms can act as a single wave, forming a superposition in which the entire object occupies multiple positions at once. Reports of this result describe how <a href=\"https://x.com/LiveScience/status/2018626732149113224#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20demonstrated%20that%20a%20nanoparticle%20of,as%20a%20wave%2C%20creating%20a%20record%2Dsetting%20superposition.\" rel=\"noopener\">Researchers</a> engineered a delicate interference pattern using this 7,000 atom cluster, while complementary coverage explains that the same type of nanoparticle was observed acting as a cohesive wave in a carefully controlled <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/quantum-physics/physicists-push-thousands-of-atoms-to-a-schrodingers-cat-state-bringing-the-quantum-world-closer-to-reality-than-ever-before#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%2C%20researchers,observed%20in%20a%20quantum%20superposition.\" rel=\"noopener\">quantum superposition</a>. A separate summary of the work emphasizes that this blob of around 7,000 sodium atoms was placed into overlapping paths that stretched across 133 nanometres, a scale confirmed in a briefing that describes <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00242-3#:~:text=At%20least%20as%20big%20as%20a%20blob,with%20superpositions%20that%20stretched%20across%20133%20nanometres.\" rel=\"noopener\">Using</a> a painstaking interferometer to reach that separation.</p> <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to freeze and fling a quantum nanoparticle</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.rdworldonline.com/mit-physicists-directly-observe-frictionless-edge-state-flow-in-ultracold-atoms-offering-a-glimpse-of-super-efficient-electronics/#:~:text=MIT%20physicists%20directly%20observe%20frictionless%20'edge%20state',electron%20behavior%20in%20the%20quantum%20Hall%20effect.\" rel=\"noopener\">Getting</a> thousands of atoms to march in lockstep as a single wave demands exquisite control over motion and temperature. In related experiments on levitated particles, physicists have used an optical trap to nudge a nanoparticle into its motional ground state, relying on a laser based technique that borrows <a href=\"https://physicstoday.aip.org/news/an-optical-trap-nudges-a-nanoparticle-into-its-motional-ground-state#:~:text=An%20optical%20trap%20nudges%20a%20nanoparticle%20into,they%20can%20be%20cooled%20to%20ultralow%20temperatures.\" rel=\"noopener\">Cooling</a> strategies from atomic physics so that even room temperature objects can be chilled to ultralow energies. Once the random jiggling is suppressed, the entire nanoparticle can be manipulated almost like a single atom, split into different paths and recombined to reveal interference fringes that betray its wave nature.</p> <p>The sodium cluster experiment builds on this toolbox, but at a scale where the object begins to resemble the metal nanoparticles that have been shown to behave like waves in other high stakes quantum tests. In those studies, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/metal-nanoparticles-behave-like-waves-in-high-stakes-quantum-experiment/ar-AA1UGSze#:~:text=Interesting%20Engineering-,Metal%20nanoparticles%20behave%20like%20waves%20in%20high%2Dstakes%20quantum%20experiment,the%20rules%20of%20quantum%20mechanics.\" rel=\"noopener\">Metal</a> clusters prepared by Researchers from the University of Vienna and the Uni were sent through interferometers to confirm that even relatively heavy particles still obey the rules of quantum mechanics. The sodium work extends that logic by creating a coherent wave out of 7,000 atoms at once, a feat that other reports describe as a record breaking experiment in which a cluster of thousands of atoms can act like a wave as well as a particle, a result highlighted in a social media summary that credits <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ScientificAmerican/posts/a-record-breaking-experiment-shows-that-a-cluster-of-thousands-of-atoms-can-act-/1281776100487326/\" rel=\"noopener\">SCIENTIFICAMER</a> with popularizing the finding.</p> <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Schrödinger’s cat grows up</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://news.cnrs.fr/opinions/an-immeasurable-quest-for-precision#:~:text=So%20much%20so%20that%20we%20are%20now,the%20photon%2C%20a%20tiny%20particle%20of%20light.\" rel=\"noopener\">language</a> around this experiment leans heavily on Schrödinger’s cat, the famous thought experiment in which a cat in a sealed box is tied to a quantum event and ends up both dead and alive until someone looks. In the idealized version, If the radioactive atom and its detector remain isolated from the environment, the system exists in a superposition of decayed and not decayed, and the cat is entangled with both outcomes until an observation collapses the state, a scenario described in detail in a discussion of how <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00177-9#:~:text=If%20the%20box%20remains%20isolated,of%20both%20dead%20and%20alive.&text=In%20the%20real%20world%2C%20objects,detected%20using%20the%20final%20grating.\" rel=\"noopener\">If the</a> box can never be perfectly shielded from its surroundings. In practice, real world objects constantly bump into stray photons and air molecules, a process called decoherence that rapidly destroys such delicate superpositions.</p> <p>What makes the sodium nanoparticle result striking is that it realizes a scaled up version of this paradox in the lab. One account describes it as the world’s biggest Schrödinger’s cat, with the wave like paths of the object separated by around 80 centimetres simultaneously, a feat that pushed quantum physics to the limit and is summarized in a report that refers to the experiment simply as <a href=\"https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/biggest-schrodingers-cat#:~:text=Magazine-,The%20world's%20biggest%20Schr%C3%B6dinger's%20cat%20just%20pushed%20quantum%20physics%20to,around%2080%20centimetres%20apart%2C%20simultaneously.\" rel=\"noopener\">Schr</a>. Another analysis quotes Sandra Eibenberger Arias, a physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin, calling the result fantastic while noting that Quantum theory does not itself impose a size limit on superpositions, a point made explicit in a piece that highlights <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00177-9#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt's%20a%20fantastic%20result%2C%E2%80%9D,Fritz%20Haber%20Institute%20in%20Berlin.&text=Quantum%20theory%20doesn't%20put,that's%20problematic%E2%80%9D%2C%20she%20says.\" rel=\"noopener\">Sandra Eibenberger</a> and her concerns about where the quantum to classical transition really lies.</p> <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When many atoms share one quantum mind</h2> <p>To <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/physicists-push-thousands-atoms-schr-100000301.html#:~:text=This%20discovery%20opens%20the%20door%20for%20future,phenomenon%20tantalizingly%20close%20to%20the%20real%20world.\" rel=\"noopener\">understand</a> what it means for thousands of atoms to merge into a single wave, it helps to look at other systems where particles act collectively. Another way of understanding this is by considering the wave nature of atoms, where, as one explanation puts it, each atom will Usually behave as an independent wave, but under the right conditions atoms behave collectively as a single wave, a description that appears in a discussion of how <a href=\"https://www.ua-magazine.com/2021/04/30/molecules-sigle-quantum-state/#:~:text=Another%20way%20of%20understanding%20this%20is%20by,atoms%20behave%20collectively%20as%20a%20single%20wave.\" rel=\"noopener\">Another</a> quantum state of matter emerges. That state is known as a Bose Einstein condensate, or BEC, in which many atoms or molecules occupy the same quantum state and effectively share one wave function.</p> <p>Physicists have spent decades learning how to create and manipulate such condensates. Early work produced ultracold atomic BECs, and more recent advances have extended the idea to molecules, with reports describing how Physicists created a molecular Bose Einstein condensate, noting that the resulting BEC allowed more complicated models of interactions, a milestone summarized in a release that highlights <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/physicists-create-first-ever-bose-einstein-condensate-made#:~:text=the%20.gov%20website.-,Physicists%20create%20first%2Dever%20Bose%2DEinstein%20condensate%20made%20of%20molecules,allowing%20for%20more%20complicated%20models.\" rel=\"noopener\">Physicists</a> and their Bose Einstein breakthrough. Later work reported a Rare form of quantum matter created with molecules for the first time, emphasizing that Scientists produced a molecular BEC that was only the kick off for exploring new phases, a point captured in coverage that refers to this <a href=\"https://www.earth.com/news/bose-einstein-condensate-bec-rare-form-quantum-matter-created-with-molecules/#:~:text=Rare%20form%20of%20quantum%20matter%20created%20with%20molecules%20for%20the%20first%20time&text=Scientists%20have%20produced%20a%20rare,just%20the%20kick%2Doff.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"noopener\">Rare</a> state as a new platform. More recently, researchers have described a molecular Bose Einstein condensate made of dipolar sodium molecules that behaves like a new source of light, with one summary noting that Physicists created a BEC of such molecules and that it was Made possible by microwave shielding, a detail highlighted in a report on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101124143407.htm#:~:text=June%203%2C%202024%20%E2%80%94%20Physicists%20describe%20the,help%20of%20microwave%20shielding%20to%20just%205\" rel=\"noopener\">Physicists</a> and their Bose Einstein work.</p> <h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quantum superchemistry and the road to real world devices</h2> <p>Once many particles share a single quantum state, their interactions can change in surprising ways. In experiments on so called quantum superchemistry, researchers have coaxed not just atoms but entire molecules into the same quantum state, then watched as chemical reactions occurred collectively rather than individually, a behavior described in detail in an account of how <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-superchemistry-observed-for-the-first-time-ever/#:~:text=To%20observe%20this%20new%20super%2Dcharged%20chemistry%2C%20researchers,chemical%20reactions%20occurred%20collectively%2C%20rather%20than%20individually.\" rel=\"noopener\">quantum superchemistry</a> was observed for the first time ever. A separate report on a New year breakthrough notes that Researchers at Columbia University created a molecular Bose Einstein condensate of sodium cesium molecules by cooling them to 5 nanoKelvin, a feat that required extreme control and is summarized in a post that highlights <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTLpA_XEmqQ/#:~:text=New%20year%2C%20new%20scientific%20breakthrough!%20Researchers%20at,time%2C%20cooling%20sodium%2Dcesium%20molecules%20to%205%20nanoKelvin.\" rel=\"noopener\">New</a> techniques.

Instead of acting as separate particles, this nanoparticle moved in a shared quantum state, creating a record-setting superposition that blurs the line between microscopic […]\",\"CreatedOn\":\"2026-02-05T20:15:00Z\",\"CreatedOnUTC\":null,\"ExpirationDate\":\"\",\"ImageHeight\":720,\"ImageWidth\":1280,\"FocalRegion\":null,\"ImageUrlVNext\":\"https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1VL7iJ.img\",\"ImageHeightVNext\":0,\"ImageWidthVNext\":0,\"TypeVNext\":\"Card\",\"Market\":null,\"ImageCarousel\":[],\"ImageCarouselVNext\":[],\"ImageEncodingFormat\":null,\"ImageGoBigSignal\":null,\"Video\":null}","isLocalNews":"0","financeMetadata":"eyJTdG9ja3MiOltdLCJTZW50aW1lbnRSYXRpbmdzIjpbeyJUb3BpYyI6IndmX3NlbnRpbWVudF9wb3NpdGl2ZSIsIlNjb3JlIjo5OTh9LHsiVG9waWMiOiJ3Zl9zZW50aW1lbnRfbmVnYXRpdmUiLCJTY29yZSI6MjE5fSx7IlRvcGljIjoid2Zfc2VudGltZW50X25ldXRyYWwiLCJTY29yZSI6ODc4MX1dLCJDYXRlZ29yaWVzIjpbXX0=","colorSampling":"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","gptvcdCondenseHeadlineV1":"{\"PreprocessingTimeUtc\":\"02-05-2026 20:33:34\",\"PostprocessingTimeUtc\":\"02-05-2026 20:35:53\",\"GPTCondensedHeadlineV1\":\"Thousands of sodium atoms merge into 1 wave\",\"GPTCondensedHeadlineV1Valid\":false,\"GPTVCDOriginalHeadline\":\"Thousands of sodium atoms merge into 1 wave, warping quantum reality\",\"GPTVCDRawGPTResponse\":\"{\\n\\\"ContainQuotation\\\": 0,\\n\\\"Explanation\\\": \\\"The condensed headline omits the key detail 'warping quantum reality,' which is central to the original's core message.
