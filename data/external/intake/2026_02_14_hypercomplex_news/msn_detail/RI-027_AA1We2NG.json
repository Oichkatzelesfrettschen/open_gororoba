Where did it come from and how fast was it going? This is what if, and here's what would happen if a hyper velocity star passed through the solar system. That thing that just ruined the weekend was a hyper velocity star. You've probably heard of shooting stars, but they're just little meteors about the size of a golf ball. A hyper velocity star is a whole lot bigger. A star is a massive sphere of very hot glowing gas. Stars produce light and energy by nuclear fusion. When two stars are locked in orbit around the same center of mass, we call them binary stars. You've probably seen this before on What If It's a black hole? Black holes are so dense that nothing can escape their gravitational field. If something gets too close to a black hole's event horizon, it's going to get swallowed. In 1988, Jack Hills, an astronomer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, theorized that if a binary star system got too close to a black hole, the black hole's gravity would send one of the binary stars flying towards the other one at thousands of kilometers per second. He called the speeding star a hyper velocity star and predicted that it would travel so fast that it would break free of the binary star and launch out into space by itself. It was a nice theory, but researchers had no way to test it. Then in 2004, Doctor Warren Brown of Harvard proved that the theory is correct. He discovered the first hyper velocity star traveling at 51,000 kilometers per hour. The good news is the star was heading away from Earth. But could there be other hyper velocity stars? And if so, are any of them heading our way? Because researchers can see so many stars in the sky, finding a hyper velocity star has been compared to looking for a needle in a haystack. But by 2015, astronomers found about two dozen hyper velocity stars heading out of the Milky Way. That's a lot of mass whizzing around out there. Lamost HVS One at roughly 42,000 light years away, is the hyper velocity star that's closest to us. It's moving at about 2.2 million kilometers per hour, and compared to our sun, it's nine times more massive, 4 times hotter and 3400 times brighter. If that star got too close to us, scientists think it might knock Earth out of its orbit. What would happen? Well, it depends on how much Earth's orbit changed and whether we found ourselves closer to the sun or further away. If we got knocked closer to the sun, you could expect global warming to accelerate, but this time it wouldn't be our fault. On the other hand, if we got knocked farther away from the sun, you'd need to invest in more long underwear. So far, the planet Jupiter has been like Earth's planetary bodyguard. Jupiter's massive gravity has grabbed a hold of comets and asteroids and thrown them away from Earth. But if a hyper velocity star is heading toward us, would Jupiter still be able to protect us? It depends on how the hyper velocity star was passing through our Galaxy. But in a worst case scenario, if the hyper velocity star hit us just right and all the planets were lined up just right, it could be like knocking over dominoes. Even though hyper velocity stars can travel at millions of kmh, we'd have lots of time to see one coming due to the immense distance it would have to travel. But how about something a little closer to home? What if the moon came crashing into Earth? Well, that's a story for another What if?","provider":{"id":"AA145RH1","name":"Underknown","companyLegalName":"VideoElephant
