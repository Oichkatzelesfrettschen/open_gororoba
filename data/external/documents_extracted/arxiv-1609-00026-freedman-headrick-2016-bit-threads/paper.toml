Abstract\r
The AdS/CFT correspondence provides quantum theories of gravity in which\r
spacetime and gravitational physics emerge from ordinary non-gravitational quan\u0002tum systems with many degrees of freedom. Recent work in this context has un\u0002covered fascinating connections between quantum information theory and quan\u0002tum gravity, suggesting that spacetime geometry is directly related to the en\u0002tanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical degrees of freedom\r
and that aspects of spacetime dynamics (gravitation) can be understood from\r
basic quantum information theoretic constraints. In these notes, we provide an\r
elementary introduction to these developments, suitable for readers with some\r
background in general relativity and quantum field theory. The notes are based\r
on lectures given at the CERN Spring School 2014, the Jerusalem Winter School\r
2014, the TASI Summer School 2015, and the Trieste Spring School 2015.\r

1 Introduction\r
Quantum mechanics is believed to be the basic underlying framework for the physics of\r
our universe. It is the foundation for quantum field theory, which successfully describes\r
the physics of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions through the Standard\r
Model of Particle Physics. One of the great challenges in theoretical physics over\r
the past decades has been trying to fit gravity, the most universal of all interactions,\r
into this quantum mechanical framework. While apparently of little relevance for\r
understanding everyday gravitational physics, coming up with a quantum theory of\r
gravity is essential in order to understand some of the most fundamental questions in\r
physics, including the physics of the big bang and the nature of black holes.\r
In our modern understanding provided by Einstein’s general relativity, gravity refers\r
to the dynamics of spacetime and its interaction with matter as governed by the Ein\u0002stein Equation. To obtain a quantum version of the theory, the most direct route would\r
seem to be applying standard quantization rules directly to the variables describing\r
spacetime geometry. However, this approach typically runs into various troubles, and\r
there are now deep reasons to believe that the correct route to a quantum theory of\r
gravity must be fundamentally different. Foremost among these is the notion that\r
gravity is “holographic” [1, 2]. That is, given a region of spacetime, the number of\r
degrees of freedom is not proportional to the volume of the region (as is the case in\r
conventional quantum field theories) but rather to the area of the region’s boundary.\r
In this case, quantizing gravity as a local field theory would seem bound to fail, since\r
these local fluctuations of the spacetime geometry cannot be the fundamental degrees\r
of freedom in the same way that local fluctuations of the electromagnetic field represent\r
the fundamental degrees of freedom in electromagnetism.\r
Great progress in our understanding of quantum gravity has come over the past\r
few decades from string theory, culminating in the first complete non-perturbative\r
models of quantum gravity provided by the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. These realize\r
the holographic principle directly: the quantum gravitational theories are defined as\r
ordinary non-gravitational quantum theories (typically quantum field theories) on a\r
fixed lower-dimensional spacetime. How does this work? The basic idea is that each\r
state of the ordinary quantum system encodes all the information about the state of\r
the higher-dimensional gravitational system. As examples, the vacuum state typically\r
corresponds to an empty spacetime, states with some low-energy excitations might\r
correspond to the spacetime with a few gravitational waves, while very highly excited\r
states of the quantum system might correspond to a spacetime with a massive black\r
hole.\r
Since the correspondence was proposed by Maldacena in 1997, there has accumu\u0002lated a great deal of evidence that the conjecture is correct. However, no proof for the\r
correspondence exists, and there remain a number of very basic questions, such as\r
• How and why do spacetime and gravity emerge from CFT physics?\r
• Precisely how is the spacetime geometry and other local gravitational physics\r
encoded in the CFT state?\r
1

Figure 1: Basic AdS/CFT. States of a CFT on some fixed spacetime B correspond to\r
states of a gravitational theory whose spacetimes are asymptotically locally AdS with\r
boundary geometry B.\r
• Which CFT states correspond to spacetimes with a good classical description (as\r
opposed to e.g. quantum superpositions of different spacetimes).\r
• What are necessary and sufficient conditions for a theory to have a gravity dual?\r
In recent years, it has become clear that to better understand these questions, it is very\r
useful to think about the CFT from the perspective of quantum information theory.\r
There is now a significant amount of evidence that the structure of quantum entan\u0002glement in the CFT state is related directly to the geometrical structure of the dual\r
spacetime. Natural quantum-information theoretic quantities such as entanglement\r
entropy and relative entropy map directly over to natural physical quantities in the\r
gravitational theory. Even aspects of gravitational dynamics can be seen to emerge\r
directly from the physics of entanglement. In these lectures, I will attempt to provide\r
an elementary introduction to some of these exciting recent developments.\r
2 The very basics of AdS/CFT\r
For completeness, we will start with a very rudimentary introduction to AdS/CFT.\r
Some useful reviews include [4, 5] but there are many others. The basic idea here is that\r
certain non-gravitational quantum systems, defined on fixed spacetimes, are equivalent\r
to quantum gravitational theories whose states correspond to different spacetimes with\r
specific asymptotic behavior.2 Each state in the non-gravitational system corresponds\r
to a state in the dual gravitational theory, and each observable in the non-gravitational\r
system corresponds to some observable in the gravitational theory. For both states\r
and observables, the interpretation on the two sides of the correspondence can be\r
completely different. One important exception is total energy: the energy of a CFT\r
state corresponds to the total energy of the spacetime (measured at the classical level\r
by the ADM mass).\r
2Alternatively, we could say that they nonperturbatively define these dual gravitational theories,\r
since there is generally not a complete alternative definition available.\r
2

In the examples that we will consider throughout these lectures, the non-gravitational\r
system will be a conformal field theory (CFT), i.e. a quantum field theory with con\u0002formal invariance, defined on some fixed spacetime B.\r
3 Often B will be Minkowski\r
space Rd−1,1 or a sphere plus a time direction S\r
d−1 × R, but we are free to choose any\r
geometry.\r
If the CFT is “holographic,” i.e. if there is a dual gravitational theory, the various\r
quantum states of the CFT are each associated with some state of this dual theory, as\r
illustrated in figure 2. The various states may describe different spacetime geometries,\r
but for a specific CFT, the asymptotic behavior of each of these spacetimes is the same.\r
For a CFT on Minkowski space Rd−1,1, the vacuum state of the theory corresponds to\r
(d + 1)-dimensional Anti-de-Sitter spacetime (AdS) with a Minkowski space boundary,\r
which may be described by the metric\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 + dxµdxµ) . (1)\r
This is a maximally symmetric negatively-curved spacetime with curvature set by the\r
length scale ℓ. The spatial geometry is hyperbolic space. The spacetime has a boundary\r
at z = 0 which lies at an infinite proper distance from any point in space, but which\r
light rays can reach and return from in a finite proper time. More general excited\r
states of the CFT are dual to different geometries which approach this geometry as\r
z → 0.4 Explicitly, we can describe these more general geometries as\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 + Γµν (x, z)dxµdxν) , (2)\r
where for small z,\r
Γµν (x, z) = ηµν + O(z\r
d\r
) . (3)\r
This description represents a choice of coordinates known as Fefferman-Graham co\u0002ordinates. For states of a CFT defined on a more general spacetime B, the story is\r
similar, except that ηµν in (3) is replaced by the metric describing B.\r
For small perturbations to the vacuum state of the CFT, the corresponding ge\u0002ometries should be represented by small perturbations to AdS, while for high-energy\r
excited states, the corresponding spacetimes can have significantly different geometry\r
and even topology. One important example is the case of a thermal state of the CFT.\r
For the Minkowski-space CFT, the geometry corresponding to a thermal state is the\r
planar AdS black hole. The story is a little more interesting for CFTs defined on a\r
sphere. In this case, there is a deconfinement phase transition in the CFT as the tem\u0002perature is increased, with the low-temperature phase dual to a gas of particles in AdS\r
and the high-temperature phase dual to a spherically-symmetric AdS-Schwarzschild\r
black hole [6].\r
3There are other examples in which the non-gravitational theory is a non-conformal field theory,\r
or even an ordinary quantum mechanical theory with a large number of quantum variables.\r
4More precisely, we expect that only a subset of CFT states correspond to states of the gravitational\r
theory with a simple classical geometrical description. For example, a quantum superposition of two\r
states corresponding to two different geometries would describe a quantum superposition of geometries.\r
3

Figure 2: Different CFT states correspond to different asymptotically AdS geometries.\r
It is interesting in general to understand which CFTs are holographic. There are\r
specific examples (e.g. maximally symmetric large N Yang-Mills theories) for which lots\r
of evidence for a dual gravitational description exists. However, we don’t have a set of\r
necessary and sufficient conditions to tell us whether any particular CFT is holographic.\r
It is believed that having a gravity dual that looks like Einstein gravity coupled to\r
matter requires a CFT with a large number of degrees of freedom (“large N”) and strong\r
coupling. There are also more detailed conditions on the spectrum of states/operators\r
of the theory; roughly, these conditions say that the CFT should have only as many\r
low-energy states as we would expect for a theory of gravity on asymptotically AdS\r
spacetime. On the other hand, it is plausible that any UV-complete theory of quantum\r
gravity on AdS can be associated with a CFT, because the gravitational observables\r
could be used to define a conformal field theory.\r
3 Entropy and geometry\r
The recent connections between quantum information theory and gravitational physics\r
actually have their roots in the early 1970s with the work of Jacob Bekenstein. In think\u0002ing about black holes in classical general relativity, Bekenstein and others [7, 8] realized\r
that the physics of black hole horizons shares qualitative features with the physics of\r
entropy in thermodynamics. Specifically, horizon area is non-decreasing with time (in\r
the classical limit), and it obeys a relation akin to the first law of thermodynamics,\r
dE = T dS with black hole mass playing the role of energy, 2πT identified with the sur\u0002face gravity κ (a measure of curvature at the horizon) and entropy identified precisely\r
with area as\r
S ↔\r
Area\r
4GN\r
. (4)\r
Based on these observations, Bekenstein made the bold suggestion that the quali\u0002tative similarities were not a coincidence; he postulated that black holes are thermody\u00024

namic systems and that the area of the horizon is the entropy of the black hole. This\r
was quickly confirmed by Hawking’s demonstration [9] that black holes radiate a ther\u0002mal spectrum of particles exactly consistent with the predicted temperature T = κ/2π.\r
However, the underlying statistical interpretation of the entropy as a count of states\r
remained mysterious for decades, since there did not exist a framework to understand\r
the microstates of black holes.\r
Jumping ahead to the present time, we can now understand the microscopic inter\u0002pretation of black hole entropy for black holes in Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, since the\r
AdS/CFT correspondence gives us a complete definition of the underlying quantum\r
theory. From the previous section, a Schwarzschild black hole in Anti-de-Sitter space\r
is identified with a high-energy thermal state of the corresponding CFT on a sphere.\r
Such a theory has a discrete spectrum of energy eigenstates |Eii, and the thermal state\r
corresponds to the usual canonical ensemble. This has a well-defined entropy counting\r
these microstates and (up to a numerical factor which is difficult to compute due to\r
the strong coupling in the CFT) the relation between entropy and temperature for the\r
CFT system is exactly what was predicted for the black hole.\r
To summarize, thermal states of holographic CFTs are dual to Schwarzschild black\r
holes in AdS, and the CFT entropy S corresponds to the horizon area of the black hole\r
(divided by 4GN ). As it turns out, this particular connection between entropy and\r
geometry is just the tip of the iceberg. It admits a massive and beautiful generalization\r
proposed in 2006 by Ryu and Takayanagi. According to our present understanding, for\r
any CFT state corresponding to some asmptotically AdS spacetime with or without a\r
black hole, and for any subsystem of the CFT, the entropy of the subsystem corresponds\r
to a the area of a particular surface in the corresponding spacetime. Before describing\r
this relation in detail and discussing its implications, it will be useful to review in more\r
detail the description of quantum subsystems, and the associated measures of entropy.\r
3.1 Quantum subsystems and entanglement\r
Consider a quantum system with a subsystem A.\r
5 We will denote the complement of\r
this subsystem by A¯. Then the Hilbert space may be decomposed as\r
H = HA ⊗ HA¯ (5)\r
Given a state |Ψi ∈ H of the full system, we can ask: “What is the state of the\r
subsystem A?” Naively, we might think that it is possible to find some state |ψ\r
Ai ∈ HA\r
that captures all information about the subsystem. We might demand that for every\r
operator OA acting on HA alone,\r
hψ\r
A\r
|OA|ψ\r
A\r
i = hΨ|OA ⊗ 11|Ψi . (6)\r
However, for general |Ψi, there does not exist such a state |ψ\r
Ai. In the context of the\r
larger system, the state of the subsystem is not described by any single state in the\r
Hilbert space HA.\r
5For a more complete review of the basics of quantum information theory, see [10].\r
5

Ensembles of quantum states\r
To properly describe the subsystem, we need to use the idea of an ENSEMBLE of\r
states, alternatively known as a MIXED STATE (as opposed to a PURE STATE i.e. a\r
single Hilbert space vector). That is, we consider a collection {(|ψii, pi)} of orthogonal\r
states and associated probabilities. We define the expectation value of an operator O\r
in the ensemble to be the average of the expectation values for the individual states,\r
weighted by the probabilities,\r
hOiensemble ≡\r
X\r
i\r
pihψi|O|ψii . (7)\r
We can think of the probabilities pi as representing some classical uncertainty about\r
the state of the system.\r
It turns out that for a multipart system, given any state |Ψi of the entire system\r
(or, more generally an ensemble of states for the full system), we can always find an\r
ensemble of states for subsystem A such that all expectation values of operators OA\r
are reproduced, i.e. such that\r
hΨ|OA ⊗ 11|Ψi =\r
X\r
i\r
pihψ\r
A\r
i\r
|OA|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i . (8)\r
We will prove this below by explicitly constructing the ensemble from |Ψi .\r
The density matrix\r
Given such an ensemble, we can define an associated operator\r
ρA ≡\r
X\r
i\r
pi|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
ihψ\r
A\r
i\r
| (9)\r
known as the DENSITY OPERATOR or DENSITY MATRIX for the subsystem. The\r
density matrix is a Hermitian operator with unit trace and non-negative eigenvalues pi.\r
In fact, any operator with these properties can be used to define an ensemble by taking\r
|ψii and pi to be the orthogonal eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix.6 Thus, the\r
density matrix provides an equivalent mathematical representation of an ensemble. To\r
compute the expectation value of an operator using the density matrix, we simply take\r
a trace:\r
hOAi = tr(OAρA) = X\r
i\r
pihψ\r
A\r
i\r
|OA|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i . (10)\r
6When some of the pis coincide, we need to make a choice for the orthogonal eigenvectors in the\r
subspace with eigenvalue pi. Expectation values of operators in the ensemble do not depend on this\r
choice, so all such ensembles are equivalent.\r
6

Calculating the density matrix for a subsystem\r
Starting from a state Ψ for the full system, it is straightforward to determine the\r
density matrix corresponding to a subsystem and thus the associated ensemble. Given\r
some basis {|ψni} for A and {|ψN i} for A¯, we can represent the state of the full system\r
as\r
|Ψi =\r
X\r
n,N\r
cn,N |ψni ⊗ |ψN i , (11)\r
where cc,N are complex coefficients satisfying the normalization condition\r
X\r
n,N\r
|cn,N |\r
2 = 1 . (12)\r
Then the operator ρ = |ΨihΨ| represents the density matrix for the whole system.\r
Taking the expectation value of an operator OA ⊗ 11 acting on our subsystem, we have\r
tr((OA ⊗ 11)ρ) = tr(X\r
n,N\r
X\r
m,M\r
c\r
∗\r
m,Mcn,N OA|ψnihψm| ⊗ |ψN ihψM|)\r
= tr(X\r
n,m\r
X\r
N\r
c\r
∗\r
m,N cn,N OA|ψnihψm|)\r
= tr(OAρA) (13)\r
where\r
ρA ≡\r
X\r
n,m\r
X\r
N\r
c\r
∗\r
m,N cn,N |ψnihψm| ≡ trA¯ ρ . (14)\r
The calculation (13) shows that for the density matrix ρA defined by the operation\r
(14), known taking the PARTIAL TRACE over the subsystem A¯, the property (8)\r
holds. This proves the claim that any quantum subsystem can always be represented\r
by an ensemble.\r
It is easy to check that equation (14) also defines a subsystem density matrix (or\r
REDUCED DENSITY MATRIX) with the desired properties in the case when the full\r
system is in an ensemble.\r
Thermodynamic ensembles and entropy\r
The notion of an ensemble is familiar from quantum statistical mechanics.\r
The MICROCANONICAL ENSEMBLE is defined as {(|Eii, pi = 1/n)}, consisting\r
of all energy eigenstates of a system within some small range of energies [E, E + dE],\r
each weighted with equal probability. We consider this ensemble when it is desired\r
to understand the expected values of various physical quantities when only the overall\r
energy for some closed system is known, but not the precise state. Our ignorance of\r
this “microstate” can be quantified by ENTROPY as7\r
S = log n . (15)\r
7We use units for which the Boltzmann constant kB is equal to one.\r
7

This serves as a measure of the number of microstates in the given energy range; the\r
logarithm is chosen so that the entropy of a non-interacting multipart system is the\r
sum of the entropies for the parts. We can think of each state as giving an individual\r
contribution\r
Sstate =\r
1\r
n\r
log n = −p log p (16)\r
to the entropy. Assuming that this contribution to the entropy from such a state is the\r
same for more general ensembles where the probabilities are not all equal (i.e. that the\r
entropy is extensive in the space of states), we obtain the more general definition8\r
S = −\r
X\r
i\r
pilog pi = − tr(ρA log ρA) (17)\r
valid for any ensemble. This general formula allows us to associate an entropy to the\r
ensemble describing any quantum subsystem. This serves as a measure of the classical\r
uncertainty arising from the mixed nature of the subsystem state.\r
Another ensemble familiar from quantum statistical mechanics is the CANONICAL\r
ENSEMBLE or THERMAL STATE of a system. This represents a system A weakly\r
coupled to a heat bath which makes up the remainder A¯ of the full system. The ensem\u0002ble can be defined by maximizing the entropy (17) subject to some fixed expectation\r
value for the energy of the subsystem,\r
tr(ρAHA) = E . (18)\r
In terms of the energy eigenstates |Eii of the Hamiltonian HA, the resulting ensemble is\r
{(|Eii, pi = e\r
−βEi/Z)} where Z =\r
P\r
i\r
e\r
−βEi\r
for β chosen to ensure (18). This parameter\r
defines the temperature of the system via β = 1/T.\r
Entanglement\r
The need to invoke ensembles as a description of quantum subsystems is directly linked\r
to the notion of QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT. Indeed, we can define entanglement\r
by saying that a subsystem A is entangled with the rest of the system if the ensemble\r
describing it has probabilities {pi} 6= 1. When the subsystem is not entangled, there\r
is a single pure state |ψ\r
Ai ∈ HA that describes it. In this case, we can write the state\r
of the full system (assuming it is pure) as\r
|Ψi = |ψ\r
A\r
i ⊗ |ψ\r
A¯\r
i . (19)\r
Thus, entanglement can alternatively be defined as the failure of the full system to be\r
representable as a product state.\r
8The latter formula for the entropy in terms of the density matrix is usually referred to as the\r
VON NEUMANN ENTROPY of a density matrix.\r
8

Measures of entanglement\r
Some entangled states are more entangled than others. For example, in a system of\r
two spins, the state\r
A| ↑i ⊗ | ↑i + B| ↓i ⊗ | ↓i (20)\r
is not entangled if A or B vanish, and entangled otherwise, but it is sensible to say\r
that the state is more entangled when the magnitudes of A and B are similar than\r
when the state is very close to one of the unentangled states. It is useful to come up\r
with measures to quantify the degree of entanglement for a subsystem.\r
Since having entanglement is the same as having classical uncertainty about the\r
state of the subsystem, one natural measure of entanglement is simply the subsystem\r
entropy (17) that quantifies this classical uncertainty. Since it also serves as a measure\r
of entanglement, this subsystem entropy is alternatively known as ENTANGLEMENT\r
ENTROPY.\r
A more general set of quantities useful in characterizing entanglement are the\r
RENYI ENTROPIES, defined as\r
Sα =\r
1\r
1 − α\r
logX\r
i\r
p\r
α\r
i =\r
1\r
1 − α\r
log tr(ρ\r
α\r
) . (21)\r
These are typically defined for integer α, but by considering general real values of α,\r
we can recover the entanglement entropy in the limit α → 1. The Renyi entropies\r
for the integer values of α tend to be easier to compute than entanglement entropy.\r
Knowing the Renyi entropies for all integer values of α up to the dimension of the\r
Hilbert space is equivalent to knowing the full set of probabilities {pi}, also known as\r
the ENTANGLEMENT SPECTRUM.9\r
Purifications\r
We have seen that given any pure state |Ψi of a quantum system, any subsystem A\r
can be described by a density matrix ρA or equivalently an ensemble {(|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i, pi)}. It is\r
sometimes useful to consider the reverse question: given an ensemble ρA for a quantum\r
system, can we find a pure state of some larger system such that ρA is the reduced\r
density matrix for the subsystem A?\r
In general there are an infinite number of such PURIFICATIONS. For an ensemble\r
ρ = {(|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i, pi)} in a Hilbert space HA, we can describe a general purification by\r
|Ψi =\r
X\r
i\r
√\r
pi|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i ⊗ |ψ\r
B\r
i\r
i (22)\r
where {|ψ\r
B\r
i\r
i} are an orthogonal set of states in some Hilbert space HB whose dimension\r
is at least as large as the number of non-zero eigenvalues of ρ. The state represented\r
9The explicit relation is via the characteristic polynomial Q\r
i\r
(λ − pi) = det(λ11 − ρ) = λ\r
D −\r
λ\r
D−1\r
tr(ρ) + . . . .\r
9

in this form is known as a SCHMIDT DECOMPOSITION; it is possible to represent\r
any state of a combined system in this way.\r
Starting from the expression (22) it is useful to note that the ensemble describing\r
the subsystem B has precisely the same probabilities (i.e. entanglement spectrum) as\r
the ensemble describing A. It follows immediately that the entanglement entropy is\r
the same for a subsystem and its complement when the full system is in a pure state.\r
One example of the idea of a purification is the idea that a thermal state (i.e. a\r
system in the canonical ensemble) arises by considering the system weakly coupled to\r
a much larger system known as a heat bath. The full system including the bath is\r
taken to be a pure state and the entropy of the thermal ensemble can be understood\r
as measuring entanglement with the bath.\r
It is sometimes useful to consider a simpler purification of the canonical ensemble,\r
obtained by choosing the purifying system to be a copy of the original system and\r
considering the state\r
1\r
Z\r
X\r
i\r
e\r
−βEi/2\r
|Eii ⊗ |Eii . (23)\r
This state, known as the THERMOFIELD DOUBLE state, is precisely symmetrical\r
between the two subsystems, giving a thermal state with the same temperature upon\r
reduction to either subsystem.\r
3.2 Two-sided black holes in AdS/CFT\r
Let’s now return to thinking about gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We\r
mentioned earlier that a Schwarzschild black hole in AdS is described via AdS/CFT\r
by a high-energy thermal state of the CFT on a sphere, and that the area of the black\r
hole horizon can be identified with the entropy of the CFT.\r
Various observables computed in the CFT thermal state tell us about the black\r
hole spacetime. It is interesting to be more precise and understand which part of the\r
black hole we can learn about. Is it just the region outside the horizon, some of the\r
physics behind the horizon, or the entire maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry\r
(which includes two asymptotic regions connected by a wormhole)?\r
In a 2001 paper [11], Maldacena argued that the maximally extended spacetime,\r
depicted in figure 3, is most naturally associated not with the thermal state of a single\r
CFT, but rather with the thermofield double state (23) of a two-CFT system.10 The\r
geometry has two asymptotic regions, each with its own boundary sphere and its own\r
black hole exterior. Correspondingly, the thermofield double state invoves two separate\r
CFTs on a sphere, each defined on a sphere and in a thermal state. Further, this\r
special purification of the thermal state is symmetrical between the two systems, like\r
the extended black hole geometry.\r
The proposal of Maldacena is very natural but has dramatic implications. The\r
individual terms in the superposition (23) are product states in a system of two non\u0002interacting CFTs. In these states, the two theories have absolutely nothing to do with\r
10It is possible to give a direct path-integral argument for this. See [12] and references therein.\r

Figure 3: Depictions of the maximally extended AdS-Schwarzschild black hole: a)\r
Penrose (conformal) diagram for the spacetime, with exterior regions I and II and\r
interior regions III and IV behind the horizon (dashed); b) spatial geometry of the\r
t = 0 slice (shown in red in a)), showing the horizon as the minimal area surface\r
dividing the space into two parts each with one asymptotically AdS region.\r
one another, so in the gravity picture, these states must correspond to two completely\r
separate asymptotically AdS spacetimes. On the other hand, the quantum superposi\u0002tion of these states in (23) apparently corresponds to the extended black hole, where\r
the two sides of the geometry are connected by smooth classical spacetime in the form\r
of a wormhole. The remarkable conclusion (emphasized in [13, 14]) is that by taking\r
a specific quantum superposition of disconnected spacetimes, we obtain a connected\r
spacetime, as depicted in figure 4. Alternatively, we can say that by entangling the\r
degrees of freedom underlying the two separate gravitational theories in a particular\r
way, we have glued together the corresponding geometries!\r
The extended black hole picture gives us a new way to think about the entropy-area\r
connection for black holes. In the thermofield double state, the black hole entropy is\r
the entropy of a single CFT subsystem or the entanglement entropy measuring the\r
entanglement of the two subsystems with each other. On the gravity side, the horizon\r
is a surface that divides the spatial geometry into two parts, with each part containing\r
one boundary sphere. It is the unique such surface in the spacetime that extremizes\r
the area functional. Thus, denoting the two CFT subsystems as A and A¯, we can\r
restate the entropy-area connection for the black hole as follows: the entropy of the\r
subsystem A (or the entanglement entropy of A) corresponds to the area of the extremal\u0002area surface dividing the bulk geometry into two parts with boundaries A and A¯. This\r
version leads us immediately to the remarkable generalization by Ryu and Takayanagi,\r
which postulates this to hold for any region A in any state with a dual geometry.\r

3.3 The Ryu-Takayanagi formula\r
In the context of AdS/CFT, the Bekenstein formula provides a geometrical interpreta\u0002tion for the total entropy of a CFT in a high-energy thermal state, identifying it with\r
the area of the horizon of the black hole in the dual spacetime. The formula proposed\r
by Ryu and Takayanagi [15] (and generalized to a covariant version by Hubeny, Ranga\u0002mani, and Takayanagi [16]) suggests an interpretation for the entropy of any spatial\r
subsystem of the CFT, for any CFT state associated with some classical spacetime.\r
To state the proposal, consider a holographic CFT defined on a spacetime geometry\r
B. We suppose that the CFT is in a state |Ψi associated with a classical dual geometry\r
MΨ. We now consider an arbitrary spatial subsystem A of the CFT, defined by first\r
choosing a spatial slice ΣB of B and then choosing a subset A ⊂ ΣB of this slice.\r
The spatial region A can be connected or a union of disconnected regions. Since the\r
boundary geometry ∂MΨ of MΨ is the same as B, we can define regions on ∂MΨ\r
corresponding to ΣB, A, and A¯ ⊂ ΣB (and we will use the same letters to refer to\r
these).\r
Now, let SA be the entropy of the subsystem A i.e. the entanglement entropy\r
measuring the entanglement of fields in A with the the rest of the system. The covariant\r
version of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal states that this entropy equals the area of a\r
certain codimension-2 surface A˜ in MΨ (i.e. d − 1-dimensional for a geometry that is\r
asymptotically AdSd+1)\r
S(A) = 1\r
4GN\r
Area(A˜) . (24)\r
The surface A˜ is defined by the following conditions:\r
• The surface A˜ has the same boundary as A.\r
• The surface A˜ is homologous to A. This means that A and A˜ together form the\r
boundary of some d-dimensional spacelike surface in MΨ. This condition together\r
with the previous condition are equivalent to saying that the surface A˜ divides\r
some bulk spatial slice ending on ΣB into two parts, such that ΣB splits into A\r
and A˜.\r

Figure 5: Geometrical features relevant to the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal. In the dia\u0002gram, the time direction has been suppressed. The left side shows a spatial slice ΣB\r
of the spacetime B on which the CFT lives. The right side shows a spatial slice of the\r
spacetime MΨ dual to the state |Ψi, containing ΣB and the extremal surface A˜.\r
• The surface A˜ extremizes the area functional. If there are multiple such surfaces,\r
A˜ is the one with least area.\r
The proposal is depicted in figure 5. A nice aspect of the proposal is that it relates\r
completely universal quantities on the two sides of the correspondence. Entanglement\r
entropy can be defined for any CFT, while on the gravity side, the area of extremal\r
surfaces is purely geometrical and thus relevant in any gravitational theory.\r
Minimal area surfaces\r
In the special case of a static geometry11, we can ignore the time direction and say\r
that the entanglement entropy for a boundary region A is computed as the area of the\r
minimal-area surface in the bulk space with the same boundary as A. This was the\r
original Ryu-Takayanagi proposal before the covariant generalization above.\r
More generally, assuming the geometry MΨ satisfies the null energy condition, the\r
covariant prescription above is equivalent finding the minimal-area surface on a spatial\r
slice Σ bounded by ΣB, but then maximizing this area over all possible slices Σ [17].\r
This “maximin” construction turns out to be very useful in proving certain results\r
about holographic entanglement entropy.\r
QFT entanglement and divergences\r
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula as it is usually stated is somewhat ill-defined, since both\r
sides of the equation actually represent divergent quantities. On the gravity side, the\r
area A˜ is divergent because there is an infinite proper distance to the boundary of AdS.\r
11More generally, these comments apply to a geometry with time reflection symmetry about a spatial\r
slice ending on ΣB when we restrict to this slice.\r
13

To understand the divergence on the field theory side, note that the subsystem we\r
are talking about (i.e. the subset of field degrees of freedom living in some spatial\r
region A) actually contains an infinite number of degrees of freedom, since we have\r
field modes with arbitrarily short wavelengths. The field modes on either side of\r
the region boundary ∂A are coupled to each other by the field theory Hamiltonian,\r
and are entangled with each other in the field theory ground state. Summing the\r
contribution to the entanglement entropy from these infinite number of modes, we\r
obtain a divergence typically proportional to the area of the boundary of A for two or\r
more spatial dimensions.\r
To make a sense out of the RT formula, we have several options. First, we can\r
work with a UV cutoff in the field theory at some high scale 1/ǫ. In the AdS/CFT\r
correspondence, this corresponds to an IR cutoff, where we keep only the z > ǫ part\r
of the geometry. With the explicit cutoff, both the CFT entanglement and the area\r
on the gravity side become finite, and when explicit calculations are possible, the two\r
results can be shown to match, up to terms which vanish as the cutoff is removed. We\r
will give one explicit example of this matching below.\r
Alternatively, we can take the usual approach in quantum field theory and work\r
with quantities that remain finite as the cutoff is removed. There are several options\r
1. We can consider certain combinations of entanglement entropies for which the\r
divergences cancel. For example S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B), which defines the\r
MUTUAL INFORMATION between A and B. We can use this to obtain a\r
regulated version of 2S(A) by choosing B to be all the points with distance ≥ ǫ\r
from A.\r
2. For excited states, we can consider the entanglement entropy relative to the\r
vacuum entanglement entropy, SA(|Ψi) − SA(|vaci).\r
3. We can look at certain derivatives of the entanglement entropy with respect to\r
some parameters describing the region. For example, for an interval of length L\r
in 1+1 dimensions, we can look at dS/dL.\r
In each of these cases, we can work with a cutoff, perform the calculations, and then\r
remove the cutoff in the end to obtain a finite result.\r
Example\r
As a simple example, we can consider the calculation of entanglement entropy for a\r
ball-shaped region B for a CFT in the vacuum state on Rd−1,1. In this case, the dual\r
geometry is Poincar´e AdS\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 − dt2 + dxidxi) ≡ Gµνdxµdxν. (25)\r
We need to find the extremal-area (d − 1)-dimensional surface in the geometry whose\r
boundary is the same as the boundary of the ball B, which we choose to be at (x\r
i\r
)\r
2 = R2\r
14

and t = 0. Since the geometry is static, we expect that the bulk extremal surface should\r
lie in the t = 0 slice.\r
If we parameterize a (d − 1) dimensional surface as Xµ(σ), the (d − 1)-dimensional\r
area functional is\r
Area = Zd\r
d−1σ\r
p\r
det gab (26)\r
where\r
gab = Gµν (X(σ))∂Xµ\r
∂σa\r
∂Xν\r
∂σb\r
(27)\r
is the induced metric on the surface. We can take the coordinates σ on the surface\r
to be the spatial coordinates x\r
i\r
, so that the surface is parameterized as Z(x\r
i\r
) with\r
T(x\r
i\r
) = 0. In this case, the induced metric reduces to\r

It is straightforward to write down the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations and\r

2 = R2 are the bulk\r
hemispheres12\r
(x\r

)\r
2 + z2 = R2\r
. (30)\r
Now, we need to calculate the area of the extremal surface. We will work in d = 2 as\r
an explicit example. To regulate the divergence associated with the infinite distance\r
to the AdS boundary, we will calculate the area of the surface in the region z > ǫ for\r
some small ǫ. We have\r

where we have defined L = 2R since the “ball” of radius R is simply an interval of\r
length 2L.\r
We can now compare this to a direct calculation of the entanglement entropy in\r
the vacuum state of a two-dimensional CFT. We recall that CFTs are characterized by\r
a central charge c which serves as a measure of the number of degrees of freedom. It\r
turns out that there is a universal formula for the entanglement entropy of an interval\r
12For the special case we are considering, there are more elegant ways of obtaining this result.\r
For example, by a conformal transformation, the boundary of the ball can be mapped to the line\r
x\r
1 = 0. The extremal surface ending on this line is simply the bulk surface x1 = 0. Applying the bulk\r
coordinate transformation corresponding to the reverse conformal transformation, this surface maps\r
to a hemisphere.\r

Figure 6: Extremal surfaces for computing the mutual information between disjoint\r
intervals in a holographic two-dimensional CFT. For sufficiently large R, the minimal\u0002area extremal surface with boundary ∂(A ∪ B) is simply A˜ ∪ B˜, so the mutual infor\u0002mation vanishes at leading order in 1/N. For smaller R, the mutual information is the\r
difference in area between the red surfaces and the black surfaces A˜ and B˜.\r
in the CFT vacuum state, depending on the central charge and no other property of\r
the CFT (see, for example, [18]). In terms of the UV cutoff 1/ǫ the result is\r

the calculation that gives rise to this result is reviewed in appendix C. Comparing with\r

long as we identify\r
c =\r

. (33)\r
This is indeed the known relation between the central charge and the gravitational\r
parameters for examples of the AdS3/CF T2 correspondence. It can be established\r
independently by comparing other physical observables such as the relation between\r
entropy and temperature in thermal states.\r
The agreement here is actually more than we would have expected in general. In\r
general, we would expect gravity calculations to be reproduced only for CFTs with a\r
gravity dual description. It just happens that the result for the entanglement entropy\r
of a single interval takes the same form for all CFTs. For more general quantities, such\r
as the entanglement entropy of a union of disjoint intervals, the CFT result depends on\r
the details of the CFT, and only for special holographic CFTs does the result match\r
with a gravity calculation [19, 20].\r
As we discussed earlier, while the result (32) is cutoff-dependent, there are various\r
UV finite quantities that we can derive from this:\r
1. First, we can take combinations of entanglement entropies for which the diver\u0002gences cancel. An example is provided by the mutual information for a holo\u0002graphic CFT in the vacuum state between two intervals A and B, which we\r
will take to be of length L separated by distance R. In this case, the mutual\r
information is\r
I(A : B) = S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B) (34)\r
16

where from (32), we have\r
S(A) = S(B) = c\r
3\r
log L\r
ǫ\r
. (35)\r
To calculated S(A∪B) holographically, we actually need to consider two different\r
possible extremal surfaces with boundary ∂(A∪B), both a disconnected union of\r
two parts, as shown in figure 6. For R > (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L, the minimal-area extremal\r
surface is simply the union of surfaces A˜ and B˜ computing S(A) and S(B), so\r
the mutual information vanishes (at leading order in 1/N). For R < (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L,\r
the alternative (red) extremal surface has less area. Thus, we have\r
S(A ∪ B) =\r
c\r
3\r
log R+2L\r
ǫ +\r
c\r
3\r
log R\r
ǫ R < (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L\r
c\r
3\r
log L\r
ǫ +\r
c\r
3\r
log L\r
ǫ R > (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L\r
. (36)\r
Combining our results as in (34), we obtain for the leading large N behavior of\r
the mutual information\r
I(A : B) =\r
c\r
3\r
log R(R+2L)\r
L2 R < (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L\r
0 R > (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L\r
(37)\r
which is finite, as promised, and has an interesting first order phase transition as\r
the separation between the intervals is increased.\r
2. We can also consider the entanglement entropy for excited states, subtracting off\r
the vacuum entanglement entropy for the same region. For example, consider\r
the thermal state of the CFT with temperature β. The entanglement entropy in\r
this state can be calculated [18] using a similar path-integral approach as for the\r
vacuum calculation (described in appendix C), or for holographic theories, using\r
the Ryu-Takayanagi formula applied to the BTZ black hole geometry (150). As\r
for the vacuum case, the result is universal, depending only on the central charge\r
of the CFT.\r
The divergent part of the entanglement entropy is the same as for the vacuum\r
case, and subtracting the two, we find for an interval of length L,\r
Sβ − Svac =\r
c\r
3\r
log \u0012\r
β\r
πL sinh πLβ\r
\u0013\r
(38)\r
In cases where L is significantly larger than β, This gives\r
Sβ − Svac ∼\r
πc\r
3β\r
L = s(β)L (39)\r
where s(β) is ordinary thermodynamic entropy density for the CFT at tempera\u0002ture β\r
−1\r
. Thus, (39) gives exactly the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem.\r
17

3. Finally, we can simply take the derivative of the entanglement entropy with\r
respect to the size of the system, which gives the finite result\r
dS\r
dL =\r
c\r
3L\r
(40)\r
In higher dimensions, there are various ways to deform the shape of an region,\r
and various possibilities for differential quantities that are UV finite (see, for\r
example [21] and [22]).\r
3.4 Evidence for Ryu-Takayanagi\r
Here, we mention a few pieces of evidence for the correctness of the Ryu-Takayanagi\r
proposal.\r
We have already seen that the formula is correct when applied to an interval in the\r
vacuum state or a thermal state of a holographic 2D CFT. Similar agreement can be\r
shown for the case of multiple intervals in the vacuum state of holographic 2D CFTs\r
[19, 20], for an interval in the thermal state of 2D CFTs, for ball-shaped regions in the\r
vacuum of higher-dimensional CFTs [23], for ball-shaped regions in CFTs deformed by\r
relevant operators [24], and for certain shape-deformations of these ball-shaped regions\r
(see e.g. [25]).\r
In general, direct calculational checks are limited by our ability to calculated en\u0002tanglement entropy in strongly coupled CFTs. However, it is possible to provide a\r
general argument for the validity of the proposal starting directly from the assumed\r
equivalence between the CFT and gravity partition functions that lies at the heart\r
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The argument makes use of the fact that the CFT\r
entanglement entropy is a limiting case of the Renyi entropies (21). As explained in\r
appendix C, these can be calculated by evaluating the CFT path integral on a multi\u0002sheeted Euclidean space defined by gluing multiple copies of the original boundary\r
space together across the regions for which the entropy is being evaluated. According\r
to the AdS/CFT correspondence, this field theory path integral should equal the path\r
integral for the gravity theory on asymptotically AdS spacetimes with boundary ge\u0002ometry equal to the multi-sheeted space appearing in the CFT path integral. In the\r
classical limit, the gravity path integral is dominated by a single saddle-point geome\u0002try, which is the solution to the classical gravitational equations with these boundary\r
conditions. The result is then e\r
−Sgrav evaluated for this solution. Thus, we have a\r
way in principle to compute Renyi entropies and therefore entanglement entropies by\r
solving a gravity problem, without assuming the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. In general,\r
finding the required solutions to compute the Renyi entropy Sn would be a difficult\r
problem requiring numerics. However, in the limit n → 1 needed to compute entan\u0002glement entropies, Lewkowycz and Maldacena have argued (in the case of static or\r
time-reflection symmetric spacetimes) [26] that the problem reduces to precisely the\r
problem of computing extremal surface areas in the original geometry. The argument\r
has recently been extended to the time-dependent case by [27].\r
18

Figure 7: Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces computing entanglement entropy for complemen\u0002tary regions A and A¯ in the thermal state on S\r
d dual to a black hole. For small enough\r
A, the minimal-area extremal surface corresponding to A˜ becomes the union of A˜ with\r
the black hole horizon.\r
Entanglement entropy for complementary subsystems\r
The holographic entanglement entropy formula also obeys various consistency checks.\r
We recall that for any pure state of a system with subsystems A and A¯, the entangle\u0002ment entropy of A matches with the entanglement entropy of A¯:\r
S(A) = S(A¯) |ΨiA∪A¯ pure (41)\r
In the RT formula, the calculation of the entanglement entropy for a region A involves\r
finding the minimal area bulk extremal surface whose boundary is the same as the\r
boundary of A. But the boundary of A¯ is the same as the boundary of A. Thus, the\r
minimal-area extremal surface is the same for both cases, and we will get the same\r
entanglement entropy, provided that such a surface is homologous to both A and A¯.\r
The latter condition requires that A and A¯ are homologous in the full geometry, which\r
is equivalent to saying that the bulk geometry has no boundary components other than\r
A ∪ A¯.\r
An example where A and A¯ can fail to be homologous is the case where the bulk\r
geometry is a black hole. For example, in the maximally extended black hole geometry,\r
A will not be homologous to A¯ since there is a second asymptotic region with its own\r
boundary. In this case, the entanglement entropy for A and A¯ will be computed by\r
separate surfaces (see figure 7) and will generally be different. But this is exactly what\r
we expect, since the state of the CFT on A ∪ A¯ is no longer pure so (41) doesn’t apply.\r
An interesting example is provided by the case where A is a small region and A¯\r
makes up the remainder of the sphere, with the CFT on the sphere taken to be in\r
some high-energy thermal state. In this case, the extremal surface corresponding to\r
the region A will remain close to the AdS boundary. For A¯ even though the boundary\r
of A¯ is small, the extremal surface must “wrap around” the black hole (as shown in\r
figure 7) in order to be homologous to A¯. In this case, it turns out that the minimal\r
area extremal surface is actually not connected, but rather a disconnected surface made\r
up of the union of A˜ with the black hole horizon. In this case we have the interesting\r
19

relation that\r
S(A¯) = S(A) + SBH . (42)\r
Subadditivity and mutual information\r
For general quantum systems with disjoint subsystems A and B, it is straightforward\r
to demonstrate that13\r
I(A; B) ≡ S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B) ≥ 0 (43)\r
This quantity, known as MUTUAL INFORMATION is a measure of entanglement and\r
correlations between the two subsystems A and B. The fact that it is always positive\r
is known as the SUBADDITIVITY of entanglement entropies. Mutual information\r
provides an upper bound for all correlations between the two subsystems; if OA and\r
OB are two bounded operators acting on HA and HB, it can be shown that [28]\r
(hOAOBi − hOAihOBi)\r
2\r
2|hOAi|2|hOBi|2\r
≤ I(A; B) . (44)\r
In a CFT, taking A and B to be disjoint spatial subsystems, the combination of\r
entanglement entropies in 43 is finite, so the positivity constraint is meaningful. Using\r
the holographic formula (24) this translates to a condition on the areas of surfaces; as\r
a consistency check, we should verify that this is satisfied. Given the extremal surfaces\r
A˜ and B˜ for A and B, the surface A˜∪B˜ is an extremal surface with the same boundary\r
as A ∪ B. The surface that computes the entanglement entropy S(A ∪ B) is defined\r
to be the minimal-area extremal surface with the same boundary as A ∪ B. Thus, its\r
area must be less than or equal to the area of of A˜ ∪ B˜, and the subadditivity relation\r
(43) follows immediately.\r
Strong subadditivity\r
More constraints arise when we consider additional subsystems. For general quantum\r
systems with disjoint subsystems A, B, and C entanglement entropy obeys the relation\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C) ≥ 0 , (45)\r
known as STRONG SUBADDITIVITY. This can be reexpressed in terms of mutual\r
information as\r
I(A; B ∪ C) ≥ I(A; B) , (46)\r
i.e. that the mutual information between A and the combined system BC must be\r
larger than the mutual information between A and B. This sounds very plausible, but\r
it turns out that the proof of strong subadditivity is rather difficult.\r
Again, we can ask whether the holographic formula for entanglement entropy re\u0002spects this. For static geometries and regions A, B, and C all on a preferred time slice,\r
13For a more detailed discussion on the entanglement constraints in this and later sections, see [10].\r
20

where we can use the original RT formula, the geometrical version of strong subaddi\u0002tivity may be easily demonstrated to hold for any geometry, as shown by Headrick and\r
Takayanagi [29]. If we consider regions on more general time slices, or time-dependent\r
geometries, the strong subadditivity relation is much more difficult to demonstrate, and\r
in fact only holds when the geometry satisfies certain conditions. While the necessary\r
conditions on the geometry are not known in general, it has been shown that the null\r
energy condition is sufficient [17].\r
3.5 Generalizations of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\r
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula should be understood as holding in a particular limit\r
where the gravitational theory is well-described by classical Einstein gravity coupled\r
to matter (without curvature couplings). Of course, the entanglement entropy is a\r
precisely defined quantity (up to the issue of divergences) for any CFT, so we might\r
expect some version of the RT formula to hold even away from this limit of classical\r
Einstein gravity.\r
For classical theories of gravity which are not Einstein gravity, there is a well\u0002known generalization of the entropy-area connection for black holes due to Wald [30].\r
In this case, area is replaced by a more general covariant quantity calculated for the\r
black hole horizon. The appropriate quantity can be determined directly from the\r
form of the gravitational Lagrangian. It is natural to suppose that this more general\r
quantity also replaces area in the holographic entanglement formula. It turns out that\r
the full story is slightly more complicated, since there can be additional terms that\r
make no contribution when evaluated on a black hole horizon. However, there are now\r
precise proposals [31, 32] for the correct quantity, based on the Lewkowycz-Maldacena\r
derivation of the RT formula applied to these more general theories.\r
Away from large N, there will also be quantum effects in the bulk theory. The lead\u0002ing corrections to the classical limit are captured by “semiclassical gravity,” in which\r
we include the effects of quantum fluctuations of the metric and other fields via a quan\u0002tum field theory living on the spacetime geometry. At this level of approximation, we\r
can think of CFT states |Ψi as corresponding to some geometry M plus some quan\u0002tum field theory state |ψbulki defined on M. On the CFT side, effects associated with\r
these quantum field fluctuations correspond to 1/N corrections. For the entanglement\r
entropy, this means that the entanglement entropy will have some leading asymptotic\r
behavior in large N plus subleading terms suppressed by powers of 1/N. Faulkner,\r
Leukowycz, and Maldacena have proposed [33] that the leading 1/N correction to en\u0002tanglement entropy in the field theory corresponds to the entanglement entropy of the\r
bulk quantum fields across the extremal surface A˜\r
S\r
CF T\r
A =\r
1\r
4GN\r
Area(A˜) + S\r
bulk\r
A˜\r
. (47)\r
For a continuum quantum field theory, the second term would have a divergence pro\u0002portional to the area of A˜, but in the context of a quantum gravitational theory, we\r
21

expect that there is a natural UV cutoff provided by the Planck scale that renders this\r
term finite.\r
3.6 Implications of the holographic entanglement entropy for\u0002mula\r
We conclude this section with some qualitative remarks on the plausible implications\r
of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.\r
Reconstructing the geometry\r
An important implication of the holographic entanglement entropy formula is that\r
much of the dual spacetime geometry for a holographic CFT state is encoded in the\r
entanglement structure of the state. In principle, we can recover the dual spacetime\r
geometry by calculating entanglement entropies for many different regions and then\r
finding a geometry M whose extremal surface areas match with the entropies. This\r
should be a highly overconstrained problem, since the entanglement entropies give us\r
some function on the space of subsets of the boundary spacetime, while geometries M\r
are specified by a handful of functions of a few coordinates (a much smaller space).\r
Thus, for a general state in a general CFT, we should expect that no geometry will\r
reproduce all the entanglement entropies.\r
Having a geometrical dual will therefore require a very special structure of entan\u0002glement for the CFT state. Given such a state, we can expect that the entanglement\r
entropies fix the geometry uniquely, with some limitations. Most importantly, there\r
can be regions of a spacetime, such as the region behind the horizon of a black hole,\r
where no extremal surface penetrates. If a CFT state is dual to some geometry with\r
such a region, known as the ENTANGLEMENT SHADOW (see e.g. [34] for a dis\u0002cussion), we will clearly not be able to learn about this region by computing spatial\r
entanglement entropies. It may be that the information about the geometry in these\r
regions may be contained in more general types of entanglement (see e.g. [35, 36]).14\r
Spacetime from entanglement\r
In the example of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole, the the two CFTs\r
have nothing to do with one another except that their states are entangled via the\r
thermofield double state. In that example, it is clear that this entanglement is a nec\u0002essary condition for the two asymptotic regions of the dual spacetime to be connected.\r
Without entanglement, we have a product state in two non-interacting systems, and\r
the only possible interpretation would be two disconnected spacetimes.\r
14It is possible to associate an entanglement entropy to any subalgebra of the full algebra of observ\u0002ables for a quantum system. The entanglement entropies that we have discussed so far correspond to\r
the full subalgebra of operators associated to spatial regions, but there are more general possibilities.\r
See [37] for some examples and the appendix of [38] for a general review.\r

Figure 8: Effect on the dual spatial geometry of disentangling the two hemispheres\r
starting from the vacuum state of a CFT on S\r
d\r
. Note that it is actually the bulk\r
metric is changing, with the boundary metric remaining fixed.\r
Motivated by this, it is interesting to ask whether even in simpler spacetimes, dual to\r
states of a single CFT, the connectedness of the geometry is related to the large amount\r
of entanglement present in low-energy CFT states. To probe this, we can consider the\r
following thought experiment [13, 14]. Starting with the vacuum state of a CFT on the\r
sphere, imagine arbitrarily dividing the sphere into two hemispheres. Now, consider\r
a one parameter family of CFT states for which the entanglement between the two\r
hemispheres decreases from the initial value in the vacuum state. What happens to\r
the dual spacetime?\r
Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we learn that as the entanglement between the\r
two sides decreases, the area of the surface dividing the two sides of the bulk spacetime\r
decreases. A separate argument suggests that the two sides also become further and\r
further apart. Thus, the picture is that the spatial geometry of the corresponding\r
spacetime stretches apart and pinches off in the middle, as shown in figure 8. This\r
picture can be checked by explicit calculations in some one parameter families of states\r
[39]. Thus, by removing the entanglement between the two halves of the CFT, it\r
appears that we are able to pull apart the corresponding spacetime. We can go further,\r
subdividing the boundary into more regions and removing the entanglement between\r
these. As we will see in more detail below, the result is that the spacetime splits up\r
into many small disconnected fragments. By removing all the entanglement (which, for\r
the case of a continuum CFT, costs an infinite amount of energy), the dual spacetime\r
disappears entirely!\r
These qualitative arguments suggest a rather remarkable conclusion: quantum en\u0002tanglement between the underlying degrees of freedom is crucial for the existence of\r
classical spacetime. We might even interpret the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as telling us\r
that spacetime is a geometrical representation of the entanglement structure of a CFT\r
state [40, 13].15\r
15There are many caveats to such a conclusion. It is an open question whether spacetime geometry\r
in the entanglement shadow, e.g. behind black hole horizons, can be understood this way. Also, there\r
are examples of holographic duality where the field theory is a simple matrix quantum mechanics. In\r
this case, there are no spatial subsystems, so a connection between entanglement and geometry would\r
have to be based on a more general type of entanglement within the system, such as those mentioned\r
in the previous footnote.\r

4 The entanglement structure of the CFT vacuum\r
In this section, we will begin to take a closer look at entanglement and other quantum\u0002information theoretic quantities in quantum field theories in order to understand how\r
they are related to features of the dual spacetime geometries and to gravitational\r
physics in these spacetimes.\r
Domains of dependence\r
Consider a local quantum field theory on some spacetime B. To define a spatial sub\u0002system, we first choose a spatial slice ΣB and then let A be a subset of this spatial\r
slice. This subset can be connected or disconnected. The fields in A represent a subset\r
of the degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory. This is most clear in a lattice\r
regularization, where we have degrees of freedom associated with specific points. There\r
are subtleties in the case of gauge theories; for more discussion on these, see [41, 42].\r
In a relativistic quantum field theory, there is a spacetime region DA that is canon\u0002ically associated with the spatial subsystem A. To define DA, we note that for some\r
spacetime points p in B, all causal (i.e. timelike or lightlike) curves through p neces\u0002sarily pass through A. The region DA is the collection of all such points, known as the\r
DOMAIN OF DEPENDENCE of A, or alternatively as the causal development region\r
or causal diamond associated with A. This is illustrated in figure 9.\r
At the classical level, the domain of dependence is important because it is the region\r
where the solution of any relativistic field equation is fully determined given initial data\r
on A. Changes to the fields in A¯ ⊂ SΣB cannot affect this region. At the quantum\r
level, any operator in DA can be expressed in terms of the field operators living on\r
the region A, making use of the field theory Hamiltonian to evolve field operators\r
backwards and forwards in time. Operators in DA commute with operators localized\r
in A¯ or DA¯.\r
The domain of dependence DA associated with a region A is also the domain of\r
dependence for an infinite number of other spatial regions, essentially any spacelike\r
surface in DA whose boundary is the same as the boundary of A, as in figure 10. The\r
density matrix associated with any of these other regions contains the same information\r
as the density matrix associated with ρA, so it is useful to think of ρA as being a density\r
24

Figure 10: Different spacelike regions with the same domain of dependence DA.\r
matrix associated with the whole spacetime region DA.\r
The full set of operators with support in A forms a closed algebra of observables\r
for the field theory; in a sense, the field theory on DA represents a complete quantum\r
system on its own. The full state of the CFT can then be understood as an entangled\r
state between this system and a complementary system given by the field theory on\r

This expression is a bit heuristic, since the spectrum in this case is generally not\r
discrete.\r
The representation (48) suggests a natural decomposition of the quantum informa\u0002tion associated with the full state as\r
|Ψi → ρA + ρA¯ + entanglement info . (49)\r
Here, it is important to note that the pair of density matrices ρA, ρA¯ represent only\r
a subset of the information contained in the state |Ψi. The rest of the information is\r
contained in the details of how the two subsystems are entangled with one another in\r
(48).\r
In our discussion below, we will see that there is a natural spacetime analog to\r
the decomposition (49). This can be motivated by noting that the representation (48)\r
bears a formal similarity to the CFT description of the two-sided black hole, where (as\r
we will argue below) the split (49) corresponds to the natural spacetime decomposition\r
into the outside-the-horizon regions on the two sides plus the black hole interior.\r
Density matrix for a half-space\r
In general, it is difficult to describe the density matrix for a spatial subsystem of a\r
quantum field theory, even for the vacuum state. One special exception is the case of\r
a half-space (e.g. x > 0, where x is one of the spatial coordinates) of Minkowski space,\r
whose domain of dependence is known as a RINDLER WEDGE. We can describe the\r
Rindler wedge as {x > 0, |t| < x} or alternatively as the region {r > 0} in the metric\r

generated by ∂η are shown in red for the x > 0 wedge.\r
where (r, η) are related to the usual Minkowski coordinates by\r
x = r cosh(η) t = r sinh(η) . (51)\r
This wedge (and the complementary x < 0 wedge) are depicted in figure 11.\r
A simple path-integral argument (see appendix C) shows that for the vacuum state\r
of any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the density matrix for the half space is\r
a thermal density matrix\r

dxµ2 ∧ · · · ∧ dxµd. (56)\r
16Recall that ∂i denotes the coordinate unit vector field in the i direction.\r
26

The fact that the density matrix is thermal with respect to this Hamiltonian which\r
generates evolution on accelerated trajectories is related to the result of Unruh that\r
an accelerated observer observing the vacuum state will see a thermal spectrum of\r
particles.\r
We can also consider the complementary Rindler wedge, associated with the spatial\r
region x < 0. The density matrix for this region is also thermal, with respect to the\r
Hamiltonian Hη\r
′ generating boosts in this complementary wedge. The full vacuum\r
state of the CFT can be understood as an entangled state between the field theories\r
defined on the two Rindler wedges. In fact, it is exactly the thermofield double state\r

where |Eii and |E′\r

i represent the energy eigenstates for the Hamiltonians Hη and Hη\r
′.\r
In the case of a free field theory, we can define modes of the fields living in each\r
of the wedges, and build the energy eigenstates of Hη and Hη\r
′ on the respective sides\r
by occupying these modes. In this case, we find that in the vacuum state (57), each\r
mode in one wedge is entangled with the corresponding mode in the other wedge. We\r
can also consider states in which this entanglement is removed, i.e. a product state\r
between the two wedges. For these states, we find that the stress tensor is singular at\r
x = t = 0 and on the boundaries of the two Rindler wedges. Thus, entanglement of the\r
field theory modes on either side of the x = 0 surface (or any other surface) is crucial\r
to obtain a well-behaved field theory state.\r
Density matrix for a ball-shaped region in a CFT\r
A Rindler wedge can be related by a conformal transformation to the domain of depen\u0002dence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski space.17 In a conformal field theory, such\r
a transformation is associated with a mapping of states that leaves the vacuum state\r
invariant. Thus, the vacuum density matrix for a ball-shaped region is the image under\r
the conformal transformation of the vacuum density matrix (52) for the Rindler wedge.\r
The Rindler density matrix is expressed directly in terms of a symmetry generator Hη;\r
this maps under the conformal transformation to the generator of a symmetry that\r
acts within the domain of dependence of the ball:\r

Our results for Minkowski space translate directly to results for the vacuum state of a\r
single CFT on S\r
d×R. On the spatial sphere Sd\r
t\r
at some time, consider any ball B (e.g.\r
a region θ < θ0 in polar coordinates) and the complementary ball B¯. Choosing some\r
point P on the boundary of B, let Dp¯ be the domain of dependence region of S\r
d\r
t − P\r
(i.e. the complement of p on S\r
d\r
t\r
). Then there is a conformal transformation that maps\r
Dp¯ to Minkowski space, taking DB and DB¯ to complementary Rindler wedges (defined\r
as the domain of dependence of a half space), as shown in figure 12.\r
This conformal transformation maps the vacuum state on the sphere to the vacuum\r
state on Minkowski space. Thus, as in the previous section, the vacuum density matri\u0002ces for the balls B and B¯ are related by the conformal transformation to the vacuum\r
density matrix of the half space. Again, we have symmetry generators HB and HB¯\r
defining a notion of time evolution in DB and DB¯ such that the density matrices for\r
the two regions are ρB = exp(−HB)/Z and ρB¯ = exp(−HB¯ /Z). Furthermore, using\r
28

the result (57), we can say that the vacuum state of the CFT on the sphere may be\r
written as the thermofield double state\r

HB and HB¯.\r
This description of the CFT vacuum has a formal similarity to the CFT description\r
(23) of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole in AdS. We can make an\r
even closer analogy by noting that the regions DB and DB¯ can each be mapped by\r
another conformal transformation (see appendix B) to the static spacetime Hd × R,\r
i.e. negatively curved hyperbolic space times time, which we can represent as\r
ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + R\r
2\r
H sinh2\r
(r/RH)dΩ\r
2\r
d−2\r
. (63)\r
Here, RH is length scale that sets the curvature of the hyperbolic space. Under this\r
transformation, the Hamiltonian HB maps to the standard CFT Hamiltonian gener\u0002ating evolution in the t coordinate. Thus, any state of the CFT on S\r
d maps to an\r
entangled state of a pair of CFTs on Hd. Specifically, the vacuum state maps to the\r
thermofield double state with temperature T = 1/(2πRH), with each of the CFTs in a\r
thermal state.\r
Our experience with thermal states of a holographic CFT on Minkowski space or on\r
a sphere might suggest that these hyperbolic space thermal states have something to do\r
with black hole dual geometries. On the other hand, the hyperbolic space thermofield\r
double state we have arrived at is simply an alternative description of the CFT vacuum\r
state on a sphere, which is dual to pure global AdS spacetime. This apparent tension\r
can be resolved by noting that there is a way to think of pure global AdS spacetime as\r
a black hole.\r
To understand this, we note that any thermal state of a CFT on hyperbolic space\r
is indeed dual to an AdS-Schwarzshild black hole, but this time with a non-compact\r
horizon with the geometry of hyperbolic space. This can be represented in the standard\r
Schwarzschild coordinates as\r

(64)\r
where fβ is a temperature-dependent function of r that vanishes at the black hole\r
horizon. However, for the special case β = 2πRH , we have fβ(r) = r\r
2/ℓ2 − 1, and\r
it turns out that the geometry (64) describes a wedge RB of global AdS equal to the\r
intersection of the causal future of DB and the causal past of DB. This is a Rindler\r
wedge of AdS in the sense that it is the bulk domain of dependence of a half-space\r
bounded by the extremal surface B˜.\r
We now see that pure global AdS can be thought of as a maximally extended black\r
hole geometry. The wedge RB represents the exterior of the hyperbolic black hole, the\r
complementary wedge RB¯ represents the exterior of a black hole in a second asymptotic\r
region, and the remaining regions to the past and future of these wedges represent the\r
black hole interior.\r
29

The gravity dual of a density matrix\r
We have seen that given a ball-shaped region B on the sphere, we can represent the\r
CFT vacuum state as an entangled state between B and B¯, where the density matrices\r
ρB and ρB¯ are thermal density matrices for a particular temperature, and the full state\r
is the thermofield double state. On the bulk side, this decomposition of the quantum\r
state naturally corresponds to a decomposition of global AdS into two complementary\r
Rindler wedges plus a behind-the-horizon region; we will now explain this in more\r
detail.\r
To motivate this correspondence, let us consider a somewhat more general question\r
[43, 44, 45]: given a state |Ψi dual to some geometry M, and given the reduced density\r
matrix ρA calculated from this state for a subsystem A, what information about the\r
dual spacetime is contained in A?\r
Since AdS/CFT is a non-local duality, there is no reason a priori that ρA should tell\r
us about any particular subset of the dual geometry. It could be that the information\r
about any local region in the dual spacetime is completely spread throughout the CFT\r
degrees of freedom. In this case, no spatial CFT subsystem would contain all the\r
information about the bulk region. However, we will now argue that ρA does encode\r
the information about the bulk physics in a particular subset of the dual geometry\r
naturally associated with the domain of dependence region DA.\r
We note first that given the density matrix ρA, we can compute the expectation\r
value of any local or nonlocal CFT observable contained within DA. We can also calcu\u0002late more general quantities, such as the entanglement entropies of spatial subsystems\r
within DA. Through the AdS/CFT dictionary, these provide information about the\r
dual geometry.\r
The causal wedge\r
As an example, we can consider response functions in the CFT, i.e. two point functions\r
at timelike separated points contained within DA. We can think of these as perturbing\r
the system at the location of the earlier operator and then measuring the response at\r
the location of the later operator. In the bulk picture, we can think of this operation as\r
making a perturbation at the boundary of AdS that propagates causally into the bulk\r
and then measuring the response of this perturbation at the AdS boundary at some\r
later time. The subset of the bulk geometry sensitive to this kind of measurement is\r
the intersection of the causal future of DA (the region to which we can send a signal)\r
and the causal past of DA (the region from which we can receive a signal). This is\r
known as the CAUSAL WEDGE associated with the subsystem A.\r
By measuring response functions and other CFT observables, it is very plausible\r
that we can recover the physics in the causal wedge. For example, we can imagine\r
inserting an arbitrarily small mirror anywhere in the causal wedge; this would have\r
a significant effect on certain response functions, since now light signals from certain\r
boundary points would bounce directly back to other boundary points creating a very\r
different response. Perturbatively around AdS, we can even write explicit CFT expres\u000230

DA\r
Figure 13: The causal wedge associated with DA (shaded) is the region for which an\r
observer restricted to the boundary region DA can send a signal to and receive a signal\r
back. Regions of spacetime causally connected to DA¯ cannot be described by density\r
matrix ρA since we can have perturbations that do not affect ρA altering the spacetime\r
anywhere in this region (e.g. via the light wave denoted in red).\r
sions corresponding to bulk operators in this causal wedge. For a ball-shaped region\r
on the boundary of pure AdS, the causal wedge is precisely the Rindler wedge RB\r
discussed above.\r
An upper bound on the size of the region dual to ρA\r
We can place a useful upper bound on the size of the region encoded in ρA as fol\u0002lows. Consider a perturbation to the field theory state which takes the form |Ψi →\r
UA¯ ⊗ 11A|Ψi. For the perturbed state, the density matrix ρA is the same as for the\r
unperturbed state, while the density matrix ρA¯ is generally changed. As an example,\r
consider local perturbations contained within DA¯. These correspond to bulk pertur\u0002bations near the boundary of AdS which can propagate causally into the geometry, as\r
for the red signal coming from the left in figure 13. In general, the region of the bulk\r
affected by such perturbations is the union of the causal future and the causal past of\r
DA¯, J\r
+(DA¯)∪J\r
−(DA¯). Since we can alter this region without altering ρA, we concluded\r
that the region dual to ρA must be contained in the complement of J\r
+(DA¯)∪J−(DA¯).18\r
In the case of pure AdS and a region B on the boundary, the complement of\r
J\r
+(DB¯ ) ∪ J\r
−(DB¯ ) is again the Rindler wedge RB, so in this case, it seems that the\r
information contained in ρB corresponds precisely to bulk information about the physics\r
inside the Rindler wedge RB.\r
18We can enlarge this by replacing DA¯ with any bulk region that can be affected by changes in ρA¯\r
that do not affect ρA.\r
31

For a generic spacetime, the causal wedge of a region A is generally smaller than\r
the complement of J\r
+(DA¯) ∪ J−(DA¯). Thus it is possible, and, as we will now see,\r
plausible, that the region dual to ρA is actually larger than the causal wedge.\r
The entanglement wedge\r
Another type of quantity that we can compute using the density matrix ρA is the set\r
of entanglement entropies for spatial regions contained within DA. According to the\r
RT/HRT formulas, these tell us about the areas of various extremal surfaces in the\r
bulk geometry. For larger boundary regions, the extremal surfaces generally penetrate\r
deeper into the bulk.19 The deepest such surface is the surface A˜ that calculates the\r
entanglement entropy of the whole region A. For a generic asymptotically AdS space\u0002time, it turns out that this surface (and many other surfaces corresponding to large\r
subsystems in DA) lies outside the causal wedge. Since the density matrix contains\r
information about the areas of all of these surfaces, it seems likely that the density\r
matrix ρA is dual to a larger region than just the causal wedge. Motivated by these\r
observations, it has been proposed [44, 17, 46] that the relevant region is the ENTAN\u0002GLEMENT WEDGE, defined to be the domain of dependence of any spatial bulk\r
region which has A˜ as one boundary component and the remaining boundary compo\u0002nent some Cauchy surface in DA. There have been various arguments supporting the\r
validity of this claim.20\r
One nice feature of the entanglement wedge proposal is that for a pure state of the\r
boundary theory, for which the regions A and A¯ have the same surface A˜ computing\r
their entanglement entropies, the entanglement wedges for these complementary regions\r
meet at the surface A˜. Thus, the spacetime naturally divides up into the two wedges\r
plus regions in the future and past of the wedges, as for the case of the maximally\r
extended black hole geometry. Note that the common information between the two\r
density matrices ρA and ρA¯ is the spectrum of non-zero eigenvalues, which allows us\r
to compute the entanglement entropy common to the two density matrices. It is thus\r
natural that the common information between the two wedges is the surface A˜, whose\r
geometry allows us to compute the entanglement entropy holographically.21\r
Note that for the case of pure AdS, the causal wedge and the entanglement wedge\r
coincide, but generically, the entanglement wedge is larger.22\r
19In fact, assuming the bulk geometry satisfies the null energy condition, it has been proven that\r
the surface moves outward spatially as the size of the region is increased [17].\r
20See [47] for a recent discussion.\r
21It is interesting to ask what other covariant geometrical quantities associated to this surface\r
correspond to in the field theory.\r
22This is implied by a theorem of Wald and Gao that light rays generically take longer to pass\r
through the bulk than to go along the boundary.\r
32

Summary\r
For a given spatial region A and its complement A¯, the information contained in the\r
state of a field theory on A ∪ A¯ decomposes naturally as\r
|Ψi → ρA + ρA¯ + entanglement info . (65)\r
We have seen that the two density matrices likely encode the physics in the entan\u0002glement wedges associated with A and A¯. In this case, the remaining region of the\r
spacetime, which lies within the light cone of the bulk surface A˜, should correspond\r
to the information about how the two field theory subsystems are entangled with one\r
another.\r
To highlight this point, we can consider field theory states for which simple observ\u0002ables contained within the regions A and A¯ are almost unchanged, but for which the\r
entanglement between the two subsystems is reduced. For example, considering the\r
vacuum state of the CFT on a sphere with ball-shaped regions B and B¯, we recall that\r
ρB and ρB¯ represent thermal ensembles with respect to the Hamiltonians HB and HB¯.\r
Choosing typical pure states |EBi and |EB¯ i from these ensembles, we can consider the\r
product state |Ψ′i = |EBi ⊗ |EB¯i.\r
23\r
In this new state, almost any simple observable localized within B or B¯ should\r
have an expectation value that agrees with the expectation value in the state |Ψi; this\r
is the basic expectation of thermodynamics. In particular, the observables such as\r
response functions used to deduce the spacetime physics dual to ρB will give nearly the\r
same results as before, so we can say that interiors of the wedges dual to ρB and ρB¯\r
will be essentially unchanged. On the other hand, the entanglement between the two\r
subsystems in the new state has gone to zero. Taking the RT formula literally in this\r
case, we would conclude that the area of the minimal surface in the bulk spacetime\r
separating B and B¯ has gone to zero.24 This suggests some kind of singularity at\r
the boundary of the bulk wedges associated with B and B¯. Thus, in the state with\r
entanglement between B and B¯ removed, we expect that the dual spacetime still\r
includes two regions that are essentially the same as the AdS Rindler wedges RB and\r
RB¯ , but instead of joining smoothly to produce global AdS spacetime, we just have two\r
disconnected wedges each ending at some type of bulk singularity. These observations\r
are summarized in figure 14.\r
These observations add weight to the suggestion that classical spacetime is con\u0002nected via entanglement in the CFT. Indeed, if we consider any point p in AdS and\r
any spacelike codimension-two plane Sp in the tangent space to that point, there will\r
be precisely one extremal surface through p tangent to Sp and ending on the boundary\r
of a ball-shaped region B on the AdS boundary. Removing the entanglement between\r
B and B¯ in the CFT as in the previous paragraph, we get two disconnected Rindler\r
wedges in the bulk (as in figure 14), each ending at the point p. Thus, the fact that the\r
23To make this precise, we should consider a regulated version of the field theory.\r
24Alternatively, it may be that the RT formula breaks down somehow, which presumably also\r
indicates a failure of classical geometry.\r

of how the two subsystems are entangled. Replacing the state with a product state\r
|ψ\r
Ai ⊗ |ψ\r
A¯\r
i where |ψ\r
Ai and |ψA¯\r
i are typical states in the ensembles ρA and ρA¯, the\r
resulting geometry corresponds to two disconnected wedges with singular boundaries.\r
space on the two sides of the plane Sp is connected smoothly at the point p is directly\r
related to the CFT entanglement between B and B¯.\r
Aside: Black holes and firewalls\r
In 2012 and subsequently, there was a great deal of discussion following a paper [48]\r
of Almheiri, Marolf Polchinski, and Sully (AMPS) on the issue of whether black hole\r
horizons are smooth as is expected from classical general relativity, or whether some\r
quantum effects lead to singular behavior there.\r
The argument in ([48]) very roughly goes as follows; see the paper for details. In\r
order to have smooth spacetime at a black hole horizon, we must have entanglement\r
between the quantum field theory modes inside and outside the horizon as in our dis\u0002cussion of Rindler space above. As a black hole evaporates, it becomes entangled with\r
its outgoing Hawking radiation. For a sufficiently old black hole, this entanglement\r
becomes maximal. The inside-the-horizon modes must then be entangled with some\r
radiation subsystem and therefore (due to basic “monogamy” constraints on entangle\u0002ment) cannot also have the entanglement with the outside-the-horizon modes required\r
to ensure a nonsingular space. Thus, the horizon of an old black hole must be singular\r
i.e. a firewall.\r
Many arguments for and against firewalls appeared in the literature in the months\r
and years following the AMPS paper. Summarizing these would be beyond the scope\r
of the current notes; however, I’ll mention a couple of interesting connections to the\r
discussion in this section.\r
34

First, there is a possible way to avoid the firewall conclusion proposed by Maldacena\r
and Susskind [49] using some of the ideas discussed above. As we have discussed, in\r
the example of the maximally-extended AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, the spacetime\r
behind the horizon is encoded in the structure of entanglement between the two CFTs.\r
From the bulk point of view, we can interpret this entanglement as being between the\r
black holes in the two separate asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Thus, the existence of\r
smooth spacetime behind the horizon actually requires the entanglement of the black\r
hole with some other system. If something like this is also true in the AMPS example\r
of an evaporating black hole, it might be that the entanglement of the black hole with\r
its outgoing radiation does not forbid a smooth spacetime behind the horizon, but\r
rather is somehow the origin of it!25\r
The best chance for a compelling argument for or against the firewall proposal is\r
within the context of a complete quantum theory of gravity. Thus, it is interesting to\r
ask whether black holes as described in the AdS/CFT correspondence have firewalls.26\r
The following argument [50] (see also [51] for a closely related argument) suggests that\r
either these black holes have firewalls, or that there is no state-independent observable\r
in the CFT that can be used to learn about the geometry behind the horizon.\r
Consider a high-temperature canonical ensemble ρthermal of states in a holographic\r
CFT. Typical states in this ensemble correspond to large black hole microstates in\r
AdS. Outside their horizons, we expect that the geometry for each of these states is\r
well-approximated by the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. We would like to ask whether\r
the black holes corresponding to these microstates have smooth spacetime behind their\r
horizon. Suppose that 1) typical states have smooth spacetime behind their horizon and\r
2) there is some bounded CFT operator O that we can use to verify this (e.g. hOi = 1\r
if an observer on some particular trajectory encounters some smooth spacetime behind\r
the black hole horizon and less than one otherwise).\r
In this case, we must have tr(ρthermalO) = 1: the expectation value in the canonical\r
ensemble should match with the expectation value in typical states since the canonical\r
ensemble is dominated by these states. The same result will hold for any purification\r
of ρthermal to some state of a larger system. Thus, we would conclude that the full\r
spacetime dual to any such purification would also have smooth spacetime behind the\r
horizon. This is certainly expected to be true for the thermofield double state, which\r
is dual to the maximally extended black hole geometry. However, it will not be true\r
for other purifications; for example, various states of the form UL ⊗ 11R|ΨiT F D will\r
correspond to perturbations to the maximally extended black hole geometry in which\r
a perturbation falling into the black hole on the left will be detected as a shockwave\r
25We have argued that entanglement between fundemental degrees of freedom underlies the connec\u0002tivity of spacetime. Maldacena and Susskind’s suggestion in [49] is that not only is this entanglement\r
a necessary condition for connectedness, it is also sufficient. That is, they propose that any time two\r
subsystems are entangled (e.g. the black hole with its Hawking radiation), there is some geometrical\r
connection (they envision a “wormhole” connecting the black hole exterior with the radiation system).\r
This is known as the “ER=EPR” (Einstein-Rosen equals Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) proposal.\r
26In the case of large AdS black holes, the black holes do not evaporate, but rather are in thermal\r
equilibrium with their Hawking radiation.\r
35

Figure 15: Two different purifications of a high-temperature thermal state ρR for a\r
CFT on S\r
d\r
. In the thermofield double, the geometry behind the black hole horizon on\r
the right is smooth, while in the perturbed state on the right, there will be a shockwave\r
behind the horizon. In either case, the density matrix ρR represents the ensemble of\r
single-sided black hole microstates. Thus, there cannot be a single operator\r
immediately behind the black hole horizon on the right, as shown in figure 15. Thus,\r
there will be states for which tr(ρthermalO) = 1 but the spacetime behind the black\r
hole horizon is not smooth, contradicting our assumptions.\r
We conclude that either the typical black hole microstates do not all have smooth\r
spacetime behind their horizon, or the CFT operators used to probe behind-the-horizon\r
physics are state-dependent, i.e. there is no single operator O that we can use for all\r
CFT states to find out if there is smooth geometry.27 For more discussion on the issue\r
of state dependence, see [53] and references therein.\r
5 Spacetime physics from entanglement constraints\r
We have seen that the entanglement structure of CFT states is directly linked to the\r
geometrical structure of the dual spacetime. It is interesting to ask how much of space\u0002time dynamics, i.e. gravitation, can be understood from the physics of entanglement.\r
It is not hard to see that geometries which capture the entanglement entropies\r
of CFTs states via the RT/HRT formulae must obey certain constraints. We have\r
already seen that entanglement entropies in general quantum systems are constrained,\r
for example by the subadditivity (43) and strong subadditivity (45) inequalities. For a\r
CFT on some spacetime B, these constraints govern which functions S(A) from subsets\r
of B to real numbers can represent the entanglement entropy of a consistent state.\r
Starting from an arbitrary asymptotically AdS geometry M with boundary B, the\r
HRT formula also gives us a map S(A) from subsets of B to real numbers. In cases\r
where this map does not satisfy the restrictions arising from entanglement constraints,\r
we can conclude that the geometry M cannot correspond to a consistent CFT state in\r
27Another possibility is the existence of “superselection sectors” [52], which is roughly the idea that\r
additional information beyond the CFT state is necessary to determine the dual spacetime.\r
36

Figure 16: Ryu-Takayanagi formula as a map from the space G of geometries with\r
boundary B to the space S of mappings from subsets of B to real numbers. Mappings\r
in region Sphys (shaded) correspond to physically allowed entanglement entropies. Ge\u0002ometries in region Gphys map into Sphys while the remaining geometries are unphysical\r
in any consistent theory for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds (plausibly equal\r
to the set of gravity theories with Einstein gravity coupled to matter in the classical\r
limit).\r
a theory for which the HRT formula is valid. If it is true that any UV complete theory\r
of Einstein gravity coupled to matter has a CFT dual in which the HRT formula holds,\r
then we must conclude that the spacetime M is unphysical.\r
In this section, we first describe a variety of basic constraints on entanglement\r
structure, and then understand the implications of these constraints for geometries\r
dual to CFT states.\r
5.1 Entanglement constraints\r
In this subsection, we review a number of basic constraints on entanglement structure\r
in quantum mechanical theories. We discuss the constraints as they apply to general\r
quantum mechanical systems and then mention the specific results for conformal field\r
theories. In the next subsection, we will understand how these constraints applied to\r
holographic CFTs translate to gravitational constraints.\r
The first law of entanglement\r
We begin with a very useful result for the first order change in entanglement entropy\r
upon variation in the state.\r
Consider a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i of a general quantum system with\r
subsystem A. Then from the definition (17) of entanglement entropy, the first order\r
37

variation in the entanglement entropy for the subsystem A is given by28\r
d\r
dλSA = − tr \u0012\r
log ρA\r
d\r
dλρA\r
\u0013\r
− tr \u0012\r
d\r
dλρA\r
\u0013\r
(66)\r
Since the density matrix ρA for any state will have unit trace, the last term vanishes.\r
To simplify the expression further, we can define HA = − log ρA(λ = 0), usually known\r
as the MODULAR HAMILTONIAN associated with the unperturbed density matrix\r
ρA(λ = 0). With this definition, we can rewrite (66) as [54]\r
d\r
dλSA =\r
d\r
dλhHAi ≡ ddλ tr(HAρA) . (67)\r
We emphasize that the modular Hamiltonian HA is defined in terms of the unperturbed\r
density matrix and is not a function of λ; thus, the derivative on the right side acts\r
only on the state ρA.\r
The result (67) has become known as the FIRST LAW OF ENTANGLEMENT,\r
since it represents a quantum generalization of the first law of thermodynamics. To see\r
this, consider the special case where the unperturbed density matrix is thermal with\r
respect to some Hamiltonian H,\r
ρA =\r
1\r
Z\r
e\r
−H/T\r
. (68)\r
Then (67) gives\r
d\r
dλSA =\r
1\r
T\r
d\r
dλhHi , (69)\r
or more simply, dE = T dS. This is the usual first law of thermodynamics, though in\r
the form (69), we are allowed to apply it to any perturbation of the state, not just\r
perturbations to some nearby equilibrium state.\r
The entanglement first law (67) is most useful in cases where we have an explicit\r
expression for the modular Hamiltonian, as when the unperturbed density matrix is\r
thermal. For a conformal field theory on Minkowski space, a useful example is provided\r
by the case where the full state is the vacuum state and the subsystem is taken to be a\r
ball-shaped region. In this case, we can use our result (58),(60) for the density matrix\r
of the ball to rewrite (67) as [54]\r
d\r
dλSB =\r

R\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
d−1x(R2 − |~x|2\r
)\r
d\r
dλhT00(x)i . (70)\r
Positivity and Monotonicity of Relative Entropy\r
The entanglement first law (67) has a natural generalization to finite perturbations. In\r
this case, the statement is an inequality, that\r
∆hHAi − ∆SA ≥ 0 . (71)\r
28Here, we should be worried about operator ordering in our manipulations, but using the cyclicity\r
property of the trace, it follows that d/dλ tr(f(ρ)) = tr(f\r
′\r
(ρ)dρ/dλ).\r
38

To understand the origin of this constraint, we need to introduce a new quantum\r
information theoretic quantity, the RELATIVE ENTROPY of two states.\r
Relative entropy is a measure of distinguishibility between a (mixed) state ρ and a\r
reference state σ associated with the same Hilbert space. It is defined as\r
S(ρ||σ) = tr(ρ log ρ) − tr(ρ log σ) . (72)\r
Relative entropy vanishes if and only if ρ = σ, and is otherwise a positive quantity.\r
Further, if A ⊂ B are two subsystems of a general quantum system, it follows that\r
S(ρA||σA) ≤ S(ρB||σB) . (73)\r
Roughly, this says that having access to a larger subsystem allows us to more easily\r
distinguish two states of the full system.\r
In terms of the modular Hamiltonian Hσ = − log σ for the reference state, we can\r
rewrite (72) as\r
S(ρ||σ) = [tr(ρ(− log σ)) − tr(σ(− log σ))] − [tr(−σ log σ) − tr(−ρ log ρ)]\r
= ∆hHσi − ∆S (74)\r
where ∆ indicates the difference between the values for the state ρ and the reference\r
state σ. Using this expression, positivity of relative entropy immediately gives the\r
finite generalization (71) of the entanglement first law. Further, monotonicity implies\r
that the difference on the right side of (74) is non-decreasing as we move to a larger\r
system size.\r
For the case of a conformal field theory, we have an explicit expression for the\r
modular Hamiltonian when the reference state is taken to be the vacuum state and we\r
consider a ball-shaped region. In this case, we have the explicit constraints that\r
π\r
R\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
d−1x(R2 − |~x|2\r
)hT00(x)i − ∆SB ≥ 0. (75)\r
and that the left side increases as we deform B to any larger ball (or, more generally\r
to any ball whose domain of dependence contains the original ball). These generalize\r
the first law constraint (70) to finite perturbations.\r
Quantum Fisher Information\r
For a given reference state σ, the positivity of relative entropy is equivalent to the\r
statement that S(ρ||σ) has a global minimum at ρ = σ on the space of density matrices\r
ρA. Thus, the first order variation away from ρ = σ must vanish, while the second\r
order variation must be positive. The first order statement is\r
δhHσi − δSA ≥ 0 = 0 , (76)\r
which is exactly the first law of entanglement that we derived directly above. At second\r
order, we have\r
S(σ + δρ||σ) = tr \u0012δρ d\r

λ=0\u0013\r
= 0 , (77)\r
which follows by taking a λ derivative of tr(ρ(λ)∂λ log ρ(λ)) = tr(δρ) = 0.\r
The quantity hδρ, δρiσ, a quadratic function of the first order perturbations, is\r
known as quantum Fisher information. It can be promoted to an inner product on the\r
tangent space to the manifold of states at σ via\r
hδρ1, δρ2iσ ≡\r
1\r
2\r
(hδρ1 + δρ2, δρ1 + δρ2i − hδρ1, δρ1i − hδρ2, δρ2i) . (78)\r
By the positivity of relative entropy, the quantum Fisher information metric is non\u0002degenerate, non-negative and can be thought of as defining a Riemannian metric on\r
the space of states.\r
A minimal set of strong subadditivity constraints\r
We have previously mentioned the constraints of subadditivity (43)\r
S(A) + S(B) ≥ S(A ∪ B) (79)\r
and strong subadditivity\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C); , (80)\r
where A, B, and C are disjoint subsystems of a quantum system. For a quantum\r
field theory on fixed spacetime B, we consider any Cauchy slice of B. Then the strong\r
subadditivity constraint must apply for the case where A, B, and C are any three\r
disjoint spatial regions of B.\r
In our discussions below, it will be useful to note [22, 55] that the full set of strong\r
subadditivity constraints is implied by a smaller set, where B is taken to be arbitrary\r
while A and C are taken to be infinitesimal. To see this, consider regions A, B, C1\r
and C2. Then the strong subadditivity constraints applied to triples {A, B, C1} and\r
{A, B ∪ C1 C2} give\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C1) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1) + S(B)\r
S(A ∪ B ∪ C1) + S(B ∪ C1 ∪ C2) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1 ∪ C2) + S(B ∪ C1) .\r
Adding these, we find\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2}) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2}) + S(B) .\r

Figure 17: Spacelike intervals for strong subadditivity.\r
Thus, if the strong subadditivity constraint applies for regions {A, B, C1} and regions\r
{A, B, C2}, it applies for regions {A, B, C1 ∪ C2}. Given general regions {A, B, C},\r
we can then divide up A and C into infinitesimal parts Ai, and Ci. Starting from\r
the strong subadditivity constraint for {A1, B, C1}, we can then use the results above\r
to keep appending infinitesimal parts Ai and Ci, eventually building up to the full\r
constraint for {A, B, C} = {∪Ai, B, ∪Ci}.\r
Two dimensions\r
As an example, consider the strong subadditivity constraints in the case of a field\r
theory in 1+1 dimensions.\r
Let B be the interval [x1, x2] while A and C are the intervals [x1 + ǫξ1, x1] and\r
[x2, x2 + δξ2], as shown in figure 17. In this case, the constraint (45) gives\r
S([x1 + ǫξ1, x1] ∪ [x1, x2]) + S([x1, x2] ∪ [x2 + δξ2])\r
≥ S([x1 + ǫξ1, x1] ∪ [x1, x2] ∪ [x2 + δξ2]) + S([x1, x2])\r
=⇒ S(x1 + ǫξ1, x2) + S(x1, x2 + δξ2) − S(x1 + ǫξ1, x2 + δξ2) − S(x1, x2) ≥ 0\r
Expanding to first order in both δ and ǫ, this gives\r

βS(x1, x2) ≤ 0 . (81)\r
This second derivative of entanglement entropy has been dubbed the “entanglement\r
density” [22].\r
Since the constraint (81) is linear in the spacelike vectors ξ1 and ξ2, it is sufficient\r
to require that the constraint be satisfied in the lightlike limit of ξ1 and ξ2, i.e. when ξ1\r
and ξ2 lie along the dotted lines in figure 17. For example, the constraint for a general\r
spacelike ξ1 is obtained as a linear combination of the constraints for ξ1 in the future\r
and past lightlike directions.\r
Thus, a minimal set of strong subadditivity constraints that imply all constraints\r
for connected regions is\r

(82)\r
The latter two constraints are saturated in the case of the vacuum state, so these are\r
likely to be more restrictive in general.\r

Aside: a one sentence proof of the c-theorem\r
As an aside, we note that the basic strong subadditivity constraints (82) lead immedi\u0002ately to a beautiful proof of the c-theorem in general two-dimensional CFTs. In fact,\r
we can write the proof, originally discovered by Casini and Huerta [56], using a single\r
sentence. There are many other interesting connections between entanglement and RG\r
flows; see for example [57, 58, 59].\r
Theorem: For any Lorentz-invariant local quantum field theory which flows from a\r
UV fixed point described by a CFT with central charge cUV to an IR fixed point de\u0002scribed by a CFT with central charge cIR, we must have cIR ≤ cUV .\r
Proof: Defining Svac(R) to be the vacuum entanglement entropy for an interval of\r
proper length R, and using\r
S([x1, x2]) = Svac \u0012q(x2 − x1)\r
µ(x2 − x1)µ\r
\u0013\r
(83)\r
by Lorentz invariance, we find that the third or fourth strong subadditivity constraints\r
in (82) applied to an interval of proper length R gives\r
c\r
′\r
(R) ≤ 0 c(R) ≡ R\r
dS\r
dR , (84)\r
which proves the c-theorem, since in the limits of small and large R where the result\r
is governed by the UV and IR CFTs respectively, (32) shows that the monotonically\r
decreasing function c(R) reduces to cUV and cIR.\r
5.2 Gravitational interpretation of the constraints for holo\u0002graphic CFTs\r
.\r
We would now like to understand the gravitational interpretation of the various\r
constraints discussed above applied to subsystems of a holographic CFT.\r
5.2.1 The entanglement first law in holographic CFTs: deriving the Ein\u0002stein Equations for small perturbations to AdS\r
First consider the entanglement first law (70), applied to a one parameter family of\r
states |Ψ(λ)i for which there are asymptotically AdS spacetimes M(λ) which compute\r
the spatial entanglement entropies for the states |Ψ(λ)i via the HRT formula. While\r
we have in mind that these states are part of some holographic CFT, we will be able to\r
derive the constraints on M without assuming anything but the validity of the HRT\r
formula.\r
Since the vacuum state |Ψ(0)i corresponds to pure AdS spacetime, small pertur\u0002bations to this state should be represented by spacetimes that are close to pure AdS.\r
Using Fefferman-Graham coordinates (2) we can represent these by\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
\r
dz2 + dxµdxµ + z\r
dHµν(z, x)dxµ\r
dxν\r
\u0001\r
(85)\r
42

where H vanishes in the limit λ → 0. We would like to understand what the first law\r
(70) tells us about the perturbation H.\r
First law for infinitesimal balls\r
It is useful to first consider the case where the ball-shaped region is an infinitesimal\r
ball around some point x0 [60]. In this case, the right-hand side of (70) depends only\r
on the expectation value of the energy density at the point x0. Using the HRT formula,\r
the left side will be determined by the area of the extremal bulk surface B˜ with the\r
same boundary as the infinitesimal ball. This surface is localized near the boundary of\r
AdS, so its area depends only on the asymptotic behaviour of the metric function H\r
in (85). A direct calculation shows that the first law translates to\r
dℓd−3\r
16πGN\r
d\r
dλH\r
i\r
i(x0, z = 0) = d\r
dλhT00(x0)i . (86)\r
Thus, the entanglement first law together with the HRT formula implies that the\r
asymptotic metric of M must be related to the CFT stress tensor expectation value.\r
This is a standard result in AdS/CFT, but we have seen that it follows directly from\r
the HRT formula.\r
We can obtain a more covariant version of (86) by noting that we have worked so\r
far with balls in the t = 0 slice, i.e. in the frame of reference of an observer with\r
four-velocity u\r
µ = (1,~0). In term of this vector, we have found that\r

16πGN\r
d\r
dλu\r
µuν\r
(Hµν − ηµνH\r

But the same calculation goes through in any frame of reference, so the result (86)\r
must hold for any timelike u. This is possible if and only if\r
d\r
dλhTµνi =\r
dℓd−3\r
16πGN\r
d\r
dλ (Hµν − ηµνH\r

For any conformal field theory, translation invariance and scaling symmetry imply that\r
the stress tensor expectation value must be conserved and traceless,\r
∂µhT\r
µνi = hTα\r
αi = 0 . (89)\r
From (87), the dual geometry must then satisfy the constraints that\r
∂µH\r
µν |z=0 = Hα\r
α|z=0 = 0 . (90)\r
These asymptotic constraints give our first restrictions on the geometry of a spacetime\r
dual to a CFT state. Taking these into account, we can simplify (87) to\r
d\r
dλhTµνi =\r
dℓd−3\r
16πGN\r
d\r
dλHµν|z=0 . (91)\r

First law for general balls\r
Now consider the first law (70) applied to general balls [61, 60]. Using the result\r
(91) and the HRT formula, we can translate the first law constraint directly to a\r
gravitational constraint as\r
d\r
dλArea(B˜) = dℓd−34R\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
d−1x(R2 − |~x|2\r
)\r
d\r
dλH00(x, z = 0) (92)\r
The left hand side can be written more explicitly starting from the area functional (26).\r
To calculate the variation in area, we can use the fact that the original surface extrem\u0002izes the area functional for the original metric. Thinking of the area as a functional\r
Area(G, X) depending on both the spacetime metric G and the embedding function\r
X, we can write the first order variation schematically as\r
δArea = δArea\r
δG δG +\r
δArea\r
δX\r
δX\r
δG δG . (93)\r
However, the surface X being extremal means that the first variation of the area with\r
respect to variations in X vanishes, so only the first term here is nonzero, i.e. we need\r
only compute the variation of the action with respect to G while keeping the surface\r
X fixed.\r
The basic relation det(M) = exp(tr(ln(M))) can be used to show that\r

This result relates the metric perturbation in the interior of the geometry to asymp\u0002totic metric perturbation. It will only be satisfied for some special choices of H. We\r
actually have an infinite number of such constraints, one for each pair (x\r

the center and radius of the ball. Associating each such constraint to a bulk point\r
(x = x0, z = R) at the tip of the extremal surface, we note that there is one constraint\r
for each bulk point. This motivates the possibility that this infinite family of non-local\r
constraints is actually equivalent to a single local equation. We will now see that this\r
is the case.\r

Converting the nonlocal constraints into a local equation\r
To obtain a local constraint on H from (96), the approach is similar to the steps used\r
to convert the integral form of Maxwell’s equations to the differential form. Essentially,\r
we use Stokes theorem. In detail, it turns out that for each choice of B, there exists a\r

It is not hard to show [60] that the vanishing of all of these integrals will hold if and\r
only if\r
δE00(x) = 0 . (103)\r
Thus, the entanglement first law constraints for ball-shaped regions in slices of constant\r
t implies the time-time component of the linearized bulk Einstein equations. To obtain\r
the remaining components, we first repeat the argument for ball-shaped regions in\r
general frames of reference. Using precisely the same reasoning that we used leading\r
up to (87), we obtain\r
δEµν = 0 , (104)\r
where µ and ν correspond to the field theory directions. The remaining equations,\r
δEzν = δEzz = 0 (105)\r
are constraint equations. They hold everywhere if they hold at z = 0, and it turns out\r
that at z = 0 they are precisely equivalent to the asymptotic constraints (90) that we\r
obtained by considering small balls.\r
We have therefore shown that the first law of entanglement for ball-shaped regions\r
in the CFTs is precisely equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations in the gravity\r
dual theory [61, 60].\r
Connection to black hole thermodynamics\r
The equivalence of the entanglement first law with the linearized Einstein’s equations\r
is closely related to the the first law of black hole thermodynamics that served as\r
46

one of the initial motivations for the connection between entropy and geometry. As\r
we described above, a Rindler wedge of pure AdS is equivalent to a Schwarzschild\u0002AdS black hole with non-compact hyperbolic horizon geometry, at a special value\r
of the temperature. While this spacetime bears little resemblance to our standard\r
notion of a black hole, it turns out that a general form of the first law of black hole\r
thermodynamics applies to this spacetime. The result, proved by Wald and Iyer [62] (we\r
review this below), says that for any perturbation satisfying the Einstein’s equations\r
linearized about this background (and more generally, any black hole background with\r
a “bifurcate Killing horizon”), the change in area of the horizon is equal to the change in\r
a certain energy defined based on the asymptotic metric. It turns out that this energy\r
is exactly the quantity δEgrav\r
B\r
coming in on the right hand side of (96). Thus, the black\r
hole first law is equivalent to the assertion that the linearized Einstein equation implies\r
the gravitational version of the entanglement first law. The result that the linearized\r
Einstein equation follows from the first law (applied to all boundary balls in all Lorentz\r
frames) thus provides a converse to the theorem of Wald and Iyer.\r
Generalizations\r
There are various generalizations of these first-order results. First, in higher-derivative\r
theories of gravity, it is known that the correct gravitational expressions for black hole\r
entropy (defined so that the laws of black hole thermodynamics work out correctly)\r
involve more general covariant functionals rather than area. It is possible to show that\r
starting with these more general functionals the entanglement first law implies the lin\u0002earized gravitational equations corresponding to the associated higher-derivative La\u0002grangian [60]. In this derivation, possible terms in the entanglement entropy functional\r
involving extrinsic curvatures do not contribute.\r
We can also take into account the leading quantum effects in the gravitational the\u0002ory by including the quantum corrections (24) in the HRT formula. For a ball-shaped\r
region, the bulk entanglement term measures the entanglement of perturbative bulk\r
fields inside the associated Rindler wedge with fields outside the wedge. This entangle\u0002ment can be related directly to the expectation value of the bulk stress-energy tensor\r
via a bulk version of the entanglement first law (67). For this calculation, we require\r
the modular Hamiltonian for a Rindler wedge of AdS, for general quantum field theory\r
in its vacuum state. Fortunately, essentially the same path integral calculation (from\r
appendix C) that gives the density matrix for a Rindler wedge of Minkowski space also\r
works in AdS, yielding an expression analogous to (54) for the modular Hamiltonian.\r
Using that expression in the first law, we find that the extra bulk entanglement term in\r
the entanglement first law results in a source term for the linearized Einstein equations\r
[63]\r
δEab = 8πGN hTabi . (106)\r
In this derivation, the universality of gravity, that all fields act as sources for gravita\u0002tion, arises from the universality of entanglement, that all fields contribute to the bulk\r
47

spatial entanglement entropy.30\r
What is the form χ?\r
For a deeper understanding of the relation between the entanglement first law and\r
the linearized Einstein equations, and to understand the meaning of the form χ that\r
played a crucial role in the derivation, it is helpful to review some formalism originally\r
introduced by Wald and collaborators (see e.g. [62, 64]). This formalism is also the\r
basis for the generalization to arbitrary covariant theories of gravity. This section is\r
not essential for understanding the remaining sections, so the reader should not worry\r
about fully absorbing the content here before continuing.\r
Consider a general classical theory of gravity with covariant Lagrangian L(g), where\r
g represents the metric as well as any matter fields. For this theory, the action can be\r
written as the integral over spacetime of a differential form\r
L = Lǫ (107)\r
where\r
ǫ =\r
√\r
gǫa1···ad+1dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxad+1. (108)\r
When we vary the action to determine the equations of motion for the theory, the usual\r
procedure is to make the variation and reorganize the result (via integration by parts)\r
as a total derivative plus a term proportional to the variation δg without derivatives on\r
δg. Requiring that this variation vanishes for any δg means that the term multiplying\r
δg must vanish. In terms of the differential form L, this means that we can write its\r
variation under a variation of the metric as\r
δL = E · δg + dθ (109)\r
where E represent quantities defined such that E = 0 are the equations of motion, and\r
· represents the various index contractions for the different fields (e.g. Eabδgab for the\r
term proportional to the metric variation). The term dθ is the exterior derivative of\r
a d-form θ; this is the total derivative term that we separate off when integrating by\r
parts.\r
The quantity θ plays an important role in the phase space formulation of our grav\u0002itational theory. We recall that in general classical mechanics systems, dynamics can\r
be understood as evolution in phase space governed by Hamilton’s equations X˙ = ξH\r
where ξH is a vector field on phase space defined in terms of a symplectic two-form W\r
and a Hamiltonian function H by\r
ξH · W = dH . (110)\r
30Various authors have argued that the linearized gravitational equations plus the assumption that\r
the stress-energy tensor acts as a source for these equations requires that the complete theory is a\r
generally-covariant theory of gravity. With the additional assumption that the black hole entropy\r
functional is simply area (which follows from our assumption of HRT), the theory is further restricted\r
to Einstein gravity coupled to matter. Thus, we have at least an indirect argument for the full\r
non-linear gravitational equations starting from entanglement physics.\r
48

For our gravitational system, the symplectic form acts on a pair (δg1δg2) of deforma\u0002tions to the metric, and is given by\r
W(g, δg1, δg2) = Z\r
Σ\r
ω(g, δg1, δg2) (111)\r
where ω is defined in terms of θ as\r
ω(g, δg1, δg2) = δ1θ(g, δg2) − δ2θ(g, δg1) . (112)\r
Now, consider the metric transformation g → g + LXg induced by a vector field X,\r
where (LX g)ab = ∇aXb + ∇bXa is the Lie derivative. This induces a flow on the\r
gravitational phase space. Using the definition (110), we can associate a phase space\r
Hamiltonian HX to this flow if for any other perturbation δg (viewed as second vector\r
field on phase space to which the one forms on the left and right side of (110) are\r
applied) we have\r
δHX = W(δg,LXg). (113)\r
As we will see below, certain very useful notions of energy in general relativity can be\r
defined in this way as the phase space Hamiltonian corresponding to specific vector\r
fields.\r
The form θ also appears in the definition of conserved quantities associated with\r
symmetries of the gravitational theory. Since the theory is diffeomorphism invariant,\r
the coordinate transformation δx = X for any vector field X represents a symmetry\r
of the theory. By the usual Noether procedure, we can find an associated conserved\r
current, which turns out to be\r
JX = θ(δX g) − X · L . (114)\r
This has been written as a differential form, so that the equation of current conservation\r
is simply\r
dJX = 0 . (115)\r
Because this holds for all vector fields X, it follows [62], that we can find a (d−1)-form\r
Q such that\r
JX = dQX + X\r
aCa (116)\r
where Ca are quantities proportional to the equation of motion that vanish on shell.\r
In terms of these definitions, the form χ used in the previous section is defined in\r
terms of X and an arbitrary variation of the fields as:\r
χ(g, δg) = δQX(g) − X · θ(δg) (117)\r
The key property of χ is that it obeys an identity\r
dχ = ω(g, δg,LXg) − X · (Eδg) − X\r
a\r
δCa . (118)\r
49

In the case where the background metric g satisfies the equations of motion E = 0 and\r
admits a Killing vector X = ξ so that Lξg = 0, this simplifies to\r
dχ = −ξ\r
a\r
δCa . (119)\r
Recalling that Ca vanishes when the equations of motion are satisfied, we have that\r
δCa is a quantity that vanishes when the variation δg satisfies the equations of motion\r
linearized about the background g.\r
This result leads directly to Iyer and Wald’s derivation of the first law of black hole\r
mechanics. In this case, we consider a black hole with a Killing horizon (i.e. a horizon\r
where some Killing vector in the black hole exterior vanishes), and take ξ to be the\r
Killing vector vanishing at the horizon. Then for any on-shell variation of the metric,\r
we have dχ = 0. Integrating this from the spacetime boundary B to the horizon B˜,\r
we get R\r
B\r
χ =\r
R\r
B˜ δQξ. For Einstein gravity coupled to matter, it turns out that the\r
expression on the right is proportional to the variation in the area of the black hole\r
horizon, while the expression on the left has the interpretation of energy, and we get\r
the first law dE = T dS once we identify S = Area/4G. For more general theories\r
of gravity, everything still works, but Qξ is no longer the area. So we have this more\r
general quantity (usually called the Wald entropy functional) that describes the black\r
hole entropy.\r
For our application to the previous section, we take g to be pure AdS, and ξ to be\r
a Killing vector (described below around equation (117)) that vanishes at the extremal\r
surface B˜. Then (119) is exactly the condition (100) that we needed above. As in\r
Wald’s derivation, the integral of χ over B˜ is the variation in the area of B˜ under\r
the metric perturbation, while the integral of χ over the boundary region B has an\r
interpretation as a variation in energy. These turn out to be exactly the conditions\r
(98) and (99) that we needed above.\r
5.2.2 Gravitational consequences of relative entropy inequalities\r
For ball-shaped regions in a holographic CFT, the expression for relative entropy (75)\r
can be translated directly to a gravitational quantity using the HRT formula and the\r
result (91) for the gravitational interpretation of the stress tensor expectation value.\r
The resulting quantity, which we denote as ∆Egrav − ∆S\r
grav, must be positive and\r
monotonic with increasing system size.31 We will now see that this quantity has the\r
interpretation as an energy associated to a bulk region that lies between the boundary\r
domain of dependence region DB and the extremal surface B˜.\r
Positivity of Fisher Information\r
We start by considering the interpretation of relative entropy for states that are small\r
perturbations to the vacuum. We recall that the leading contributions to relative\r
entropy come at second order and define the Fisher information (77).\r
31The application of relative entropy in holography was initiated in [54].\r

boundary. Solid blue paths indicate the boundary flow associated with HB and the\r
conformal Killing vector ζ. Dashed red paths indicate the action of the Killing vector\r
ξ.\r
On the gravity side, the positivity of Fisher information implies the positivity of\r
a certain perturbative gravitational energy [65]. To define this, consider the Rindler\r
wedge of the unperturbed AdS spacetime associated with the boundary ball B. Asso\u0002ciated to this is a bulk Killing vector ξB that vanishes on the Rindler horizon (i.e. the\r
extremal surface B˜ in the unperturbed spacetime) and asymptotes to the boundary\r
conformal Killing vector (59) near the AdS boundary, as shown in figure 19. Explicitly,\r
in the Rindler wedge associated with a ball of radius R situated at the origin on the\r
boundary Minkowski space, the Killing vector takes the form\r

We can verify that this satisfies LξgAdS = 0, vanishes at ~x2 + z\r
2 = R2 and reduces to\r
(59) in the region DB at the boundary of AdS. For the quantum field theory describing\r
perturbative bulk fields on the pure AdS background, this timelike Killing vector defines\r
to a symmetry, so there is an associated conserved energy, which includes contributions\r
from all fields including the metric perturbation. This takes the form\r

perturbation that acts as a source for the second order metric perturbation in the\r
perturbative Einstein equations.32 This quantity is known as the canonical energy\r
associated with the Killing vector ξB. Thus, Fisher information in the CFT is dual\r
to canonical energy on the gravity side, and the relative entropy inequalities imply\r
that this energy must be positive for the Rindler wedges associated with all possible\r
boundary balls and must increase as we increase the size of the ball.\r
Relative entropy constraints for general asymptotically AdS geometries\r
The fact that relative entropy corresponds to a natural gravitational energy at second\r
order in perturbations to pure AdS suggests that this quantity might be related to some\r
notion of energy more generally. This is very interesting, as it is a notoriously difficult\r
problem to come up with precise covariantly defined notions of energy for gravitational\r
subsystems.\r
For a general asymptotically AdS spacetime, there will be no Killing vectors, and\r
no preferred definition of time apart from the boundary time used to define the ADM\r
mass of the whole spacetime. It is therefore unclear a priori how to define useful\r
notions of energy for subsystems. However, the following definition turns out to be\r
the precise dual of relative entropy associated with a ball-shaped region B [66]. In\r
place of the Killing vector (120) defined for a Rindler wedge of AdS, we define a vector\r
ξ in the entanglement wedge associated with B that has the same behavior as the\r
Rindler wedge Killing vector near the extremal surface and near the AdS boundary.\r
Specifically, we demand that ξ reduces to the conformal Killing vector ζB at the AdS\r
boundary region DB, that ξ vanishes at the extremal surface B˜, and that the Killing\r
equation (Lξg)ab = ∇(aξb) = 0 is satisfied at the boundary (up to some order in z)\r
and at the extremal surface. We also require that the antisymmetrized derivative at\r
the extremal surface has the same behavior as for the Rindler wedge Killing vector.\r
It is always possible to satisfy these conditions, and in fact there is a great deal of\r
freedom in choosing ξ since it is essentially unconstrained away from the boundaries\r
of the entanglement wedge.\r
Though our general asymptotically AdS spacetime M has no Killing vectors, the\r
vector ξ generates a diffeomorphism, and this is a symmetry of the gravitational theory.\r
32To derive this result, we can use the results (98) and (99) that δSgrav and δEgrav are related to\r
the integral of the form χ over B˜ and B respectively. Assuming the background and perturbations\r
satisfy the equations of motion, we can then use the identity (118) to obtain\r
d\r
dλ(δSgrav − δEgrav) = Z\r
ω(g,\r
d\r
dλg,LXg) , (122)\r
which can be shown to hold at any point on a one-parameter family of solutions. Taking another\r
derivative and setting λ = 0 so that g = gAdS, we get\r
d\r
2\r
dλ2\r
(δSgrav − δEgrav)|λ=0 =\r
Z\r
ω(g,\r
d\r
dλg,LX\r
d\r
dλg) . (123)\r
The expression on the right is defined by Hollands and Wald [64] to be the canonical energy associated\r
with ξ, and shown to be equivalent to (121).\r
52

Thus, we can define an associated symmetry current (the quantity Jξ defined in (116))\r
and integrate over a spatial slice of the entanglement wedge to define the corresponding\r
charge EB. Remarkably, this charge is independent of the choice of ξ, and it is exactly\r
the quantity dual to relative entropy. Thus, if the spacetime M does correspond to\r
some consistent CFT state, the energy EB associated with the entanglement wedge\r
of B must be positive for every choice of B and be larger for a larger ball B′ with\r
DB ⊂ DB′.\r
This result can be understood as a prediction for a new positive energy theorem\r
in general relativity. We have derived it making use of basic quantum mechanical\r
constraints in the underlying CFT description for the theory. However, it is plausible\r
that assuming some standard energy condition in GR would be sufficient to derive the\r
result directly as a theorem in classical general relativity.\r
Example: spherically symmetric geometries\r
As a simple example, we can consider the constraints on regular spherically-symmetric\r
asymptotically AdS geometries in four dimensional gravity, for example, the geometry\r
associated with a spherically symmetric distribution of matter obeying some equation\r
of state. If this solution represents a consistent state in a UV-complete theory of\r
gravity, it should correspond to a homogeneous state of some CFT on a sphere. For\r
this state, the relative entropy to the vacuum state for any ball-shaped region must\r
be positive. Taking the region to be a hemisphere, and using the expression (170) for\r
the modular Hamiltonian of a ball in the vacuum state on a sphere, the positivity of\r
relative entropy (71) yields [55]\r
∆A ≤ 2πGNMℓ . (124)\r
where the left side represents the area of the surface bisecting the spherically-symmetric\r
space relative to this area in pure AdS,33 and M is the mass of the spacetime. The\r
right side is obtained from the modular Hamiltonian expectation value using the fact\r
that for a translation-invariant stress-tensor on the sphere (which we assume to be of\r
unit radius), we have\r
∆hT00i =\r
ECF T\r
4π\r
=\r
Mℓ\r
4π\r
. (125)\r
The result (124) tells us that there is a limit to how much a certain mass can deform\r
the spacetime from pure AdS. This should restrict the equation of state that matter in\r
a consistent theory of gravity can have. It would be interesting to understand whether\r
this constraint also follows from one of the more standard energy conditions typically\r
assumed in general relativity.\r
5.2.3 Strong Subadditivity\r
We can also investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions on a dual spacetime M\r
for the strong subadditivity constraints to be satisfied. According to Wall [17], the\r
33This surface will be extremal by symmetry. We are assuming it is the minimal-area extremal\r
surface; if not, the results we derive apply to the minimal area extremal surface instead.\r
53

null energy condition is a sufficient condition, but the necessary conditions for strong\r
subadditivity may be weaker, and it is interesting to understand precisely what strong\r
subadditivity tells us about the dual spacetime.\r
So far, there are some limited results [55, 22] for the gravitational interpretation of\r
the constraints (82) in the case of two dimensional CFTs. For a geometry MΨ dual\r
to some holographic CFT state, the constraints are that (82) hold, where S(x1, x2) is\r
replaced by the area of the minimal-length geodesic with endpoints x1 and x2 on the\r
boundary of AdS. In [55, 22], it was found that for geometries dual to the vacuum\r
states of Lorentz invariant field theories corresponding to RG-flows between UV and IR\r
CFTs, and also for non-vacuum states of a CFT corresponding to small perturbations\r
to AdS, the strong-subadditivity constraints are exactly equivalent to the conditions\r
Z\r
B˜\r
Gµν k\r
µ\r
k\r
ν ≥ 0 (126)\r
where k is a null vector field defined along B˜ and normalized so that the spatial scale\r
factor in the geometry changes by the same rate at all points on the curve when we\r
translate by k. This represents a version of the null energy condition averaged over\r
a spatial geodesic. Extending these results to more general geometries and to higher\r
dimensions is an interesting open question.\r
6 Which theories and which states are holographic?\r
In the previous section, we considered constraints on spacetimes dual to states of\r
holographic conformal field theories. We assumed that for these states (which we will\r
call holographic), the entanglement entropies of spatial regions are all encoded in a\r
single geometry M via the holographic entanglement entropy formula. This represents\r
a very special structure of entanglement: the space of possible entanglement entropies\r
(functions on a space of subsets of the AdS boundary) is much larger than the space\r
of possible asymptotically AdS metrics (functions of a few spacetime coordinates), so\r
only a tiny fraction of all quantum field theory states should be geometric in this way.\r
For a general conformal field theory, there is no reason to expect any of the states\r
to have their entanglement represented geometrically. Even for holographic conformal\r
field theories, not all states will have this property: taking a quantum superposition of\r
a small number of states corresponding to different classical geometries, the resulting\r
state will correspond to a quantum superposition of geometries rather than a single\r
classical geometry. Thus, it is an interesting question to understand better which the\u0002ories have these holographic states and which states of these theories are holographic.\r
In this section, we will mention a few of the special properties characterizing holo\u0002graphic states and holographic theories, specifically those related to entanglement\r
structure.\r

A necessary condition for CFTs with Einstein gravity duals from entangle\u0002ment\r
For the vacuum state of any conformal field theory, the vacuum entanglement entropies\r
for ball-shaped regions are given by a universal formula (e.g. equation (32) for the\r
two-dimensional case) that matches with the areas of extremal surfaces in pure Anti\r
de Sitter spacetime. However, taking any more general region A, the CFT vacuum\r
entanglement entropy for this region would not be expected to match with the gravity\r
result for the area of the extremal surface A˜ in AdS. Requiring this agreement gives\r
a necessary condition for a CFT to have a holographic dual whose classical limit is\r
Einstein gravity coupled to matter (i.e. for which the entanglement functional is simply\r
area). Since this condition must hold for all possible regions A˜, it should be quite\r
constraining; perhaps it is even a sufficient condition for a CFT to have an Einstein\r
gravity dual.\r
One way to investigate this constraint in more detail is to start with the case of a\r
ball-shaped region and work perturbatively in deformations to the shape of the region.\r
For recent calculations along these lines, see [25].\r
Entanglement entropy from one-point functions in holographic states\r
Now consider a theory which has a holographic dual theory with some particular bulk\r
equations of motion in the classical limit. Any classical spacetime MΨ dual to a holo\u0002graphic state |Ψi must be a solution to the bulk equations of motion. We can think of\r
the bulk equations as determining a solution everywhere starting from some initial data\r
on a Cauchy surface. In AdS, it is convenient to think instead of the bulk solution as\r
being determined by evolution in the holographic radial direction, with “initial data”\r
specified at the timelike boundary of AdS.34 Thus, for geometries dual to holographic\r
states, we can say that the bulk spacetime (at least in a perturbative sense) is encoded\r
in the boundary behavior of the various fields.\r
The boundary behavior of the light bulk fields is determined according to AdS/CFT\r
by the one-point functions of some associated low-dimension local operators in the CFT.\r
For example, we have seen that the boundary behavior of the metric is determined\r
by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor as in (91). Once we have the\r
bulk spacetime solution, we can use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate many\r
other non-local quantities in the CFT such as correlation functions and entanglement\r
entropies. Thus, the assumption that a state is holographic allows us (via gravity\r
calculations) to determine the entanglement entropies and other non-local properties\r
of the state from the local data provided by the one-point functions:\r
|Ψi → hOα(x\r
µ\r
)i → φα asymptotics → φα(x\r
µ\r
, z) → entanglement entropies S(A)\r
(127)\r
where φ here indicates all light fields including the metric.\r
34Here, the existence and uniqueness of solutions is less clear, but we can at least construct solutions\r
perturbatively away from the boundary.\r
55

Figure 20: The interior region I in a slice of AdS is contained in the entanglement\r
wedge for any CFT subsystem larger than A¯, but no CFT subsystem smaller than A.\r
The recipe (127) could be applied to any state, but for states that are not holo\u0002graphic, the results will be inconsistent with the actual CFT answers. For example,\r
using this recipe, the vacuum one-point functions for any CFT will give us pure AdS\r
spacetime, and we have seen in the previous subsection that entanglement entropies for\r
more general regions will generally not match with those calculated by the holographic\r
formula from this spacetime.\r
Thus, we have a stringent (in-principle) test for whether a CFT state has a dual\r
description well-described by a classical spacetime: carry out the procedure in (127)\r
and compare the results with a direct CFT calculation of the entanglement entropies;\r
if there is a mismatch for any region, the state is not holographic.\r
Quantum error correction\r
An interesting feature of holographic states is that they share some features with states\r
referred to by quantum information theorists as “quantum error-correcting codes” [67].\r
The basic feature of these states is that they encode some specific information non\u0002locally, in such a way that the information can be recovered if we have access to any\r
sufficiently large subsystem. Thus, even if a (sufficiently small) part of the our system\r
is corrupted somehow, we can still recover the encoded information by looking at a\r
complementary subsystem.\r
To understand the connection with the AdS/CFT correspondence, recall that the\r
density matrix ρA for a spatial subsystem A of the CFT encodes information about\r
the entanglement wedge (call this WA) in the bulk, as we discussed in section 4. Now,\r
consider some ball I in the interior of AdS, as shown in figure 20. According to the\r
duality between density matrices and bulk entanglement wedges, we can say that\r
• The information about I is contained in the density matrix for any region larger\r
than A¯, since the region I will be contained in the corresponding entanglement\r
56

wedge.\r
• The information about I is not contained in the density matrix for any region\r
smaller than A, since none of the corresponding entanglement wedges intersect\r
I\r
Thus, we have a behavior similar to a quantum error-correcting code; the information\r
about the central region is “protected” from corruption of small subsystems. The latter\r
property shows that this protection is not achieved by simply storing the information\r
many times in different spatial subsystems (as in classical error-correction), but rather\r
by distributing it nonlocally throughout the system.\r
An interesting consequence of this picture is that for a bulk observable localized\r
in the region I, there cannot just be a single CFT operator corresponding to this\r
observable, since no nontrivial CFT operators are common to all subsystems larger than\r
A¯ (alternatively, there are no operators that commute with all operators in subsystems\r
smaller than A). Instead, there must be a family of CFT operators corresponding to\r
this observable, such that each CFT subsystem larger than A¯ contains one of these\r
operators. Since the operators in this family are different, they cannot have the same\r
expectation values for all states of the CFT, but it is possible that they agree on some\r
subset (or subspace) of the states for which we have nice classical dual geometry. In\r
the language of quantum error correction, this is the “code subspace.”\r
In summary, one of the special features of holographic states that distinguish them\r
from general CFT states is that they have features reminiscent of quantum error\u0002correcting codes. For a more detailed discussion, see [67, 68].\r
Entropy inequalities for holographic states\r
In the previous section, we have discussed constraints on entanglement entropies that\r
must hold in all multipartite quantum systems. We have seen that for holographic CFT\r
states, some of these constraints can be related to properties of the dual geometries. For\r
example, in static geometries, strong subadditivity inequalities can be shown to hold\r
automatically from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [29]. It turns out that by assuming the\r
existence of a dual geometry for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds, it is possible\r
to prove additional constraints on entanglement entropies that are not generally true\r
in all quantum systems. As an example, it can be shown [69] that for any state dual\r
to a static asymptotically AdS geometry, we have\r
S(A ∪ B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ B) − S(B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ C) + S(A) + S(B) + S(C) ≤ 0 , (128)\r
known as the negativity of tripartite information. Unlike subadditivity and strong sub\u0002additivity, this inequality is not generally true in quantum systems. Thus, it represents\r
a necessary condition for a CFT state to be holographic (at least in the state case). A\r
more general family of such constraints has been discussed in [70].\r

7 Conclusion\r
There are many interesting topics that I have not been able to mention here, due to\r
limitations of time and my own expertise; this is certainly not meant to be a com\u0002prehensive review of the subject. The reader is encouraged to look at some of the\r
references, and also to see which recent papers cite some of the key references in order\r
to get a sense of what is going on currently. Also recommended are various online\r
lectures, for example those from the “It From Qubit” summer school at Perimeter In\u0002stitute, and from various recent conferences on gravity and entanglement at KITP and\r
the Perimeter Institute. To conclude, I will briefly mention of a few more interesting\r
topics that may be useful to be aware of.\r
Dynamics of entanglement\r
It is interesting to understand how entanglement evolves in time-dependent states. For\r
example, we can consider either a “global quench” in which the Hamiltonian of a sys\u0002tem suddenly undergoes a translation-invariant perturbation, or a “local quench” for\r
which the perturbation is localized to some finite region. In either case, the state of\r
the system will evolve with time after the quench, and we can ask about the time\u0002dependence of the entanglement entropy for regions of a certain size (and, in the case\r
of the local quench, location). Many authors have considered this problem in quantum\r
field theories and in holography; understanding the behavior in holographic theories\r
implied by gravitational physics gives us further constraints on the properties of holo\u0002graphic CFTs and holographic states. For some recent work on this subject, including\r
interesting connections to quantum chaos, see for example [71, 72, 73, 74] and references\r
therein.\r
Kinematic space\r
In section 5.2, we saw that the linearized Einstein equations in the bulk could be un\u0002derstood in the CFT language as saying that the entanglement first law is satisfied for\r
all ball-shaped regions in all Lorentz frames. This space of regions, or alternatively\r
the space of domain of dependence regions DB for all balls B, has been called “kine\u0002matic space”; in recent work [75, 76, 77], there have been hints that various aspects of\r
CFT physics and of AdS/CFT might be understood naturally using the language of\r
kinematic space.\r
We can define a natural set of coordinates on kinematic space by noting that the\r
domain of dependence DB of each ball-shaped region is bounded by the future light\r
cone of some point x0 and the past lightcone of some point x1 in the future of x0.\r
Thus, we can associate points in kinematic space with pairs of points X = (x0, x1) on\r
the original spacetime with x1 in the future of x0; this is some 2d-dimensional space.\r
There is a conformally-invariant signature (d, d) metric on this space [76, 77], and also\r
a natural partial ordering: we say X1 < X2 if DX1 ⊂ DX2.\r
All regions DX are conformally equivalent. We can define a mapping from each\r
DX to some standard region D0 (e.g. the domain of dependence of a unit sphere\r
58

in Minkowski space, or hyperbolic space times time). Then, given any state |Ψi of\r
the CFT, the density matrix ρDX maps to some density matrix ρ0 for our standard\r
region D0. Thus, for every state of the CFT, we can associate a function ρ0(X)\r
from kinematic space to the space of density matrices for the CFT on D0. Starting\r
from this construction, we can we define other natural functions on kinematic space,\r
for example, the vacuum subtracted entanglement entropy ∆S(X). For states close\r
to the vacuum, this has been shown to satisfy some simple differential equation on\r
kinematic space [76, 77]. We can also consider the relative entropy to some reference\r
state, R(X)|Ψ0i. Monotonicity of relative entropy implies that any such function\r
obeys R(X)|Ψ0i > R(Y )|Ψ0i for X > Y ; i.e. these relative entropy functions are\r
all monotonic on kinematic space with respect to the natural partial ordering.\r
It will be interesting to see whether additional new insights about CFTs and holog\u0002raphy will be gained by thinking about these kinematic space structures.\r
Tensor Networks\r
Holographic CFTs are strongly coupled theories with a large number of degrees of\r
freedom. Thus, it is difficult to understand their quantum states directly; most of\r
what we know about these states is based on calculations in the dual gravitational\r
theory. It is interesting to ask whether we can find examples of states in simpler\r
quantum systems which share qualitative features with the holographic CFT states.\r
At the very least, constructing such states is a useful way of demonstrating that certain\r
features deduced from the gravity side (e.g. a particular structure of entanglement)\r
are even possible in a consistent quantum system.\r
Recently, starting with the work of Swingle [40], it has been understood that certain\r
states associated with “tensor networks” share many features with states of holographic\r
CFTs; thus studying the physics in the tensor network states may give us new insights\r
into holography.\r
To define tensor network states, consider a quantum system with Hilbert space\r
H = Hd ⊗ Hd ⊗ Hd · · · ⊗ Hd (129)\r
where we typically imagine that the dimension-d tensor product factors correspond\r
to subsystems arranged spatially, as in a spin chain. Given a set of basis elements\r
|i1i ⊗ |i2i ⊗ · · · , a general state of the system can be written as\r
|Ψi =\r
X\r
i\r
ψi1i2...iN\r
|i1i ⊗ |i2i ⊗ · · · |iN i . (130)\r
Thus, any state of the system corresponds to some tensor ψi1i2...iN.\r
One is often interested in finding the ground state of a system for some particular\r
choice of Hamiltonian, e.g. a local Hamilton that includes interactions between tensor\r
product factors corresponding to nearby subsystems. It turns out that in many such\r
cases, we can come up with a very good approximation to the ground state by building\r
59

the tensor ψi1i2...iN\r
out of simpler tensors. For example, consider a general three-index\r
tensor MiA\r
B, which could be used to describe a map\r
M : HD → HD ⊗ Hd (131)\r
as\r
M =\r
X\r
i,A,B\r
MiA\r
B\r
|ii ⊗ |AihB| . (132)\r
From this tensor M, we can define a state of our original system (known as a matrix\r
product state) as\r
ψi1i2...iN =\r
X\r
Ai\r
Mi1A1\r
A2Mi2A2A3\r
· · ·MiN AN\r
A1\r
. (133)\r
This construction can be represented diagrammatically as in figure 21a.35. The ex\u0002pression (133) can be thought of as a variational ansatz used to approximate the true\r
ground state. If the dimension D of the auxiliary space is not too large, the number of\r
parameters defining the state (133) is far smaller than the number of parameters defin\u0002ing a general state of the system, so solving the variational problem is computationally\r
much less demanding that finding the exact ground state. For systems with long-range\r
correlations (e.g. those which approximate continuum conformal field theories), simple\r
tensor network states (133) generally do not provide a good approximation to the true\r
ground state but we can consider states associated with more complicated networks\r
such as the one shown in figure 21b. One might hope that certain tensor network states\r
of this type, which provide good approximations to CFT ground states, could provide\r
a useful toy model for holographic states. Specifically, we might hope that such states\r
have a structure of entanglement similar to that in holographic theories, as suggested\r
originally by [40].\r
In recent work [68, 78], tensor network states have been constructed for which\r
the entanglement structure is “geometric” just as in holographic theories. These\r
states obey a Ryu-Takayanagi formula where the entropy of a subsystem A is well\u0002approximated by the “area” of a minimal surface in the network, defined to be the\r
minimal number of network links that need to be cut in order to isolate A from the\r
rest of the system. This is illustrated in figure 21b. In particular, [78] has shown that\r
this feature is generically true if the dimensions associated to legs in the network are\r
large and the tensors are chosen randomly. Thus, if we choose a network for which the\r
graph minimal “areas” behave in the same way as the minimal surface areas in AdS or\r
some other geometry (e.g. by choosing the graph to be a discretization of the given ge\u0002ometry), we obtain states whose entanglement structure is very similar to holographic\r
CFT states. In the models of ([68]), the network states have also been shown to have\r
35To be more precise, we could draw arrows on the edges of the graph such that an outgoing arrow\r
represents a lower index and an incoming arrow represents an upper index. Alternatively, we can\r
take all the vertices to represent tensors with lower indices (i.e. states) and edges to represent index\r
contractions with some choice of tensor Mij , giving T\r
1\r
···i···MijT\r
2\r
···j···\r
. There is no particularly natural\r
choice for Mij ; we can take Mij = δ\r
ij , but this is basis-dependent.\r

tensors with indices corresponding to large-dimension spaces) obey a Ryu-Takayanagi\r
formula: the entanglement entropy of a subsystem (e.g. the legs to the right of the\r
red dashed line) is proportional to to the minimal number of cuts required to separate\r
this subsystem from the rest of the network. We can think of this as the “area” of the\r
dashed red surface.\r
features of quantum error-correcting codes, as expected for holographic states. Thus,\r
certain tensor network states to seem to provide a nice explicit construction of states\r
in simple quantum systems with qualitative features of holographic states.\r

A Metrics\r
In this section, we collect various representations of vacuum Anti de Sitter space and\r
asymptotically Anti de Sitter black hole geometries that will be useful in our discus\u0002sions.\r
To describe Anti-de-Sitter space AdSd+1, we can start by considering the (d + 1)-\r
dimensional hyperboloid\r
− X\r
2\r
−1 − X\r
2\r
0 + X\r
2\r

of (d + 2)-dimensional space with metric\r
ds2 = −dX2\r
−1 − dX20 + dX21 + · · · + dX2d\r
. (135)\r
The resulting spacetime has signature (d, 1) but has closed timelike curves correspond\u0002ing to orbits of the rotation symmetry in the (X−1, X0) plane. We can consider instead\r
the universal cover of this space, obtained by letting the angular coordinate associated\r
with this symmetry have a range (−∞, ∞) instead of [0, 2π). The resulting spacetime\r
is pure global Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, or “global AdS”, a homogeneous and isotropic\r
Lorentzian spacetime. For certain calculations, it is useful to work directly with these\r
embedding space coordinates, taking into account the constraint (134).\r
We can alternatively represent global AdS via the metric\r
ds2 = ℓ\r
2\r
(− sinh2ρdt2 + cosh2ρdρ2 + ρ\r
2\r
dΩ\r
2\r
d−1\r
) (136)\r
which arises by parameterizing the surface by\r
X0 = ℓ cosh ρ cos τ\r
X−1 = ℓ cosh ρ sin τ\r
Xi = R sinh ρΩi. (137)\r
Here, Ωi are combinations of the angular coordinates on S\r
d−1 whose squares sum to\r
one (e.g. (cos θ,sin θ cos φ,sin θ sin φ) for S\r
2\r
.\r
Here, the spatial metric in (136) describes d-dimensional hyperbolic space, the\r
homogeneous and isotropic space with negative curvature. Note that the metric of\r
AdS is not simply hyperbolic space times time, but rather a “warped product,” in\r
which the time dilation factor relating coordinate time to proper time varies with\r
space.\r
Starting from any point in AdS, there is an infinite proper distance to ρ = ∞.\r
However, a light signal can reach ρ = ∞ and return in finite proper time. Thus, there\r
is a sense in which Anti de Sitter space has a boundary at ρ = ∞ that can be probed\r
by light signals. To highlight this causal structure, it is useful to define yet another set\r
of coordinates,via\r
tan θ = sinh ρ . (138)\r
With this definition, the metric becomes\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
cos2 θ\r
(−dτ 2 + dθ2 + sin2θdΩ\r
2\r
) , (139)\r
so that the boundary is at θ = π/2. Apart from the overall factor which has no effect on\r
light-ray trajectories, the geometry is that of a Euclidean ball times time. Trajectories\r
of light rays are the same in this space as in AdS, so this description is very useful\r
in understanding the causal structure. For this reason, AdS is often depicted as a\r
(filled) cylinder with the vertical direction representing time, as shown in figure 22. It\r
is important to keep in mind that while the cylinder appears to have points near the\r
62

Figure 22: Cylinder representation of Anti-de-Sitter space. Shaded wedge is the\r
Poincar´e patch of AdS.\r
middle and points closer to the boundary, it is an infinite volume spacetime in which\r
all points are equivalent.\r
The overall factor in front of the metric (139) diverges at the boundary, so while\r
the boundary has a well-defined causal structure, it does not a priori have a particular\r
geometry associated with it. However, sometimes it is convenient to make a choice of\r
boundary geometry consistent with this causal structure. In practice, a simple way to\r
do this is to define a coordinate z which vanishes at the boundary, such that the metric\r
near the boundary of AdS takes the form\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
\r
dz2 + Γµν (z, x)dxµdxν\r
\u0001\r
. (140)\r
where Γµν(z, x) has a finite limit Γ0\r
µν (x) as z → 0. This choice is known as a Fefferman\u0002Graham system of coordinates. In this representation, surfaces of constant z then have\r
a particular geometry induced by the metric in AdS. If we rescale the metric for these\r
surfaces by z\r
2\r
in the limit z → 0, we obtain a well-defined geometry in the limit,\r
described by the metric Γ0\r
µν (x). We will refer to this as the boundary geometry. We\r
emphasize that this boundary geometry is artificial and represents a choice among the\r
class of geometries with the same causal structure. Such geometries are related by a\r
conformal transformation (i.e. an overall spacetime-dependent rescaling of the metric).\r
No experiment in AdS can be performed to determine which geometry in this class is\r
the boundary geometry.\r
For pure AdS spacetime, the Fefferman-Graham representation of the metric with\r
boundary geometry chosen to be S\r

. (142)\r
This is a convenient representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a\r
conformal field theory defined on a sphere times time.\r
We can also choose a Fefferman-Graham description with Minkowksi space bound\u0002ary geometry, in which the metric takes the particularly simple form\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 + dxµdxν) . (143)\r
These coordinates cover only a portion of AdS, the shaded region in figure 22 known\r
as the “Poincar´e patch”. The coordinates in (143) are related to the global AdS\r
coordinates in (136) by\r

where Ωi = sin θ1 cos θ2, ...,sin θ1 sin θ2 · · ·sin θd−1 such that cos2θ1 + Ω2\r
i = 1. This is a\r
very useful representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a holographic\r
conformal field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime.\r
Asymptotically locally AdS geometries\r
In the AdS/CFT correspondence, general holographic states of a CFT on a bound\u0002ary spacetime B correspond to spacetimes which are asymptotically locally AdS, with\r
boundary geometry B. These may generally be represented in Fefferman-Graham co\u0002ordinates (140), where Γ(z = 0) is taken to be the metric of B. Spacetimes associated\r
with different states are associated with different behavior for Γ away from z = 0.\r
Some important examples are the black hole geometries in AdSd+1, corresponding to\r
the CFT in a thermal state. For global AdS, the corresponding black hole is spherically\r
symmetric and can be described by\r
ds2 = −fS(r)dt2 +\r

These can also be described in Fefferman-Graham coordinates; for example the metric\r
of a 2+1 dimensional planar-AdS black hole (known as a BTZ black hole) can be\r
rewritten as\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 − (1 − µz2/2)2dt2 + (1 + µz2/2)2dx2) . (150)\r
This solution (for the special case of 2+1 dimensions) is locally the same as pure AdS\r
(as are all solutions to Einstein’s equations in three dimensions without matter). By\r
a coordinate transformation, this geometry can be mapped onto the region in the\r
geometry (143) which is the intersection of the causal past and the causal future of\r
a diamond-shaped region which is the domain of dependence of the interval {x ∈\r
[−1, 1], t = 0} on the boundary.\r
B Conformal transformations on density matrices\r
In this appendix, we briefly review a few relevant facts about conformal symmetries in\r
field theory. We say that two spacetimes M and M˜ with metrics g(x), g˜(˜x) are related\r
by a conformal transformation if there is a map\r

µ\r
dx˜\r
ν = Ω2\r
(x)gµν(x)dxµdxν(152)\r
where the overall spacetime-dependent scaling Ω(x) is known as the conformal factor.\r
Conformal field theories on two spacetimes related by such a conformal transformation\r
are equivalent, and there is a one-to-one mapping between the states of the two theories\r
that we can write as\r
ρM = UΩρM˜ U\r
†\r
Ω\r
. (153)\r
In the special case where the two spacetimes are equivalent to one another (e.g.\r
where they are both Rd,1 and the transformation represents a translation, boost, scal\u0002ing, inversion or some combination of these), this transformation defines a map on the\r
space of states of a single theory. The vacuum state of a CFT on Rd,1or S\r
d × R is\r
invariant under these transformations, which represent the spacetime symmetries of\r
the CFT.\r
65

Examples\r
There are several specific examples of conformal transformation that will be useful to\r
us in the context of AdS/CFT. First, we can show that Minkowski space is conformally\r
equivalent to a part of S\r
d × R, namely the domain of dependence of a sphere minus\r
a single point p, as shown in figure 12.36 Through this transformation, any state of\r
the CFT on the sphere can be associated with a Minkowski space CFT state for each\r
such domain of dependence region. The vacuum state of the sphere CFT maps to the\r
vacuum state of the CFT on Minkowski space.\r
Through this transformation, the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region on\r
the sphere maps to the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski\r
space. By a further conformal transformation mapping Minkowski space to itself, this\r
domain of dependence region can be mapped to the domain of dependence of a half\r
space (for example x\r
1 > 0). This region is also conformally equivalent to the static\r
spacetime Hd ×R, where Hdis hyperbolic space, the non-compact Euclidean manifold\r
of constant negative curvature.\r
C Path integral representation of states and den\u0002sity matrices in quantum field theory\r
Path integrals are a familiar tool in quantum field theory to represent various useful\r
quantities such as the partition function or the generating functional for correlation\r
functions. They can also be used to represent various states and density matrices.\r
We begin with the basic result that transition amplitudes can be expressed as a path\r
integral as\r
hφ1(t1)|e\r
−iHt|φ0(t0)i = N\r
Z φ(t1)=φ1\r
φ(t0)=φ0\r
[dφ]e\r
iS(φ(t))\r
, (154)\r
where N is a normalization factor. The derivation, found in most field theory text\u0002books, involves splitting the time evolution operator into a product of infinitesimal\r
pieces and inserting between each factor the identity operator, expressed as a sum over\r
the projection operators associated with a complete basis of states.\r
Taking t = −iβ, we obtain the corresponding Euclidean statement\r
hφ1|e\r
−βH|φ0i = N\r
Z φ(β)=φ1\r
φ(0)=φ0\r
[dφ]e\r
−SEuc(φ(τ))\r
, (155)\r
where SEuc is the action analytically continued to Euclidean space. Up to a normaliza\u0002tion factor, these are the matrix elements of the density matrix for the thermal state\r
e\r
−βH/Z, i.e. the canonical ensemble. This path integral is depicted in figure 23a.\r
The partition function Zβ = tr(e\r
−βH) is obtained by setting φ1 = φ0 and integrating\r
over φ0, which is equivalent to defining the path integral on a space with periodic\r
36Alternatively, this is the set of all points on Sd × R spacelike separated from the point p.\r

by noting that\r
lim\r

e\r
−βH |Ψi = N |vaci (158)\r
since, writing |Ψi as a linear combination of energy eigenstates, all states with en\u0002ergy higher than the vacuum state energy obtain a relative coefficient e\r

that\r
vanishes in the limit. In terms of the path integral, this gives\r

as depicted in figure 23d. Starting from (157) and taking the limit β → ∞ or work\u0002ing directly from (159), we obtain a path integral expression for the density matrix\r
associated with a region A in the vacuum state (figure 23e),\r

where the field is taken to be continuous across τ = 0 in the region A¯. This is the path\r
integral over Euclidean space with boundary conditions defined on either side of a cut\r
at the spatial region A at τ = 0. We will denote this spacetime with the cut by MA.\r
It is now straightforward to describe a path integral calculation of the Renyi en\u0002tropies (21) and entanglement entropy (17). To calculated tr(ρ\r
n\r

cyclically gluing them together with the fields below the cut one each copy taken\r
to be continuous with the fields above the cut in the next copy. This is depicted in\r
figure 23f.\r
In order to calculate the entanglement entropy, the standard method (known as\r
the “replica trick”) is to find an analytic expression for the Renyi entropies Sα in (21)\r
68

calculated using (161) and then take the limit α → 1. Alternatively, we can define\r
the entanglement entropy in terms of the integer Renyi entropies by various integral\r
identities, for example\r
SA =\r
Z ∞\r

daX∞\r
n=0\r

which makes use of the identity\r

The calculation of entanglement entropy (32) for an interval in 2D CFTs can be carried\r
out directly using these path integral methods, as explained in [18].\r
Vacuum density matrix for a half space\r
Using the path integral technology above, we now derive a universal result for the\r
density matrix of a half-space in the vacuum state of a Lorentz-invariant quantum field\r
theory. Starting from the expression (160), and denoting the region x\r
1 > 0 by R, we\r
have\r

[dφ]e\r
−SEuc(φ(τ))\r
, (164)\r
Next, consider the change of variables to polar coordinates in the x\r
1\r
, τ plane,x\r
1 =\r
r cos(θ), τ = r sin(θ). This gives\r
hφ\r
R\r

1\r
φR(θ=0)=φ\r
R\r
0\r
[dφ]e\r
−SEuc(φ(τ))\r
, (165)\r
Now, we notice that the expression on the right takes the same form as the expression\r
(155) with τ replaced by θ and β replaced by 2π. The expression in (155) defined the\r
density matrix e\r
−βH , where H was the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable\r
t = iτ . We conclude that the expression (164) defines the density matrix e\r
−2πHη\r
, where\r
Hη is the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable η = iθ. For this analytically\r
continued angle coordinate, the metric back in Lorentzian space becomes\r
dr2 + r\r
2\r
dθ2 → dr2 − r\r
2\r
dη2, (166)\r
and we can recognize the metric on the right as describing a Rindler wedge of the\r
original Minkowski space, defined as the domain of dependence of the half-space x\r
1 > 0.\r
Explicitly, we have x\r
1 = r cosh(η) and t = r sinh(η). Here η defines ”Rindler time,”\r
and the associated generator Hη is the ordinary boost generator\r
Hη =\r
Z\r
x1>0\r
d\r
d−1x\r
\b\r
x\r
1T00\t\r
. (167)\r
69

The final result is that the density matrix for a half space is the thermal density matrix\r
defined in terms of the boost generator,\r
ρR =\r
1\r
Z\r
e\r
−2πHη\r
. (168)\r
As η can be viewed as the time coordinate for a family of observers on accelerated tra\u0002jectories, this result is closely related to the result of Unruh that accelerated observers\r
(who only have access to the physics in the Rindler wedge) experience thermal physics.\r
Modular Hamiltonians\r
Starting from the result (167,168) for the half-space vacuum density matrix, we can\r
determine various explicit results for modular Hamiltonians in conformal field theory.\r
For reference, we record the results here.\r
For a ball-shaped region B of radius R and center x0 in Minkowski space, the\r
modular Hamiltonian H = − log ρB is given by\r
H = 2π\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
dx\r
R2 − (~x − ~x0)\r
2\r
2R\r
T00 . (169)\r
For a ball-shaped region θ < θ0 on a sphere, we have\r
H = 2π\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
dx\r
cos(θ) − cos(θ0)\r
sin(θ0)\r
T00 . (170)\r
In the special case of 1+1 dimensional CFTs the modular Hamiltonian can also be\r
calculated for thermal state can be obtained from the vacuum state by a conformal\r
transformation. For a spatial interval [−R, R] in an unboosted thermal state with\r
temperature T = β\r
−1\r
, the modular Hamiltonian is\r
H =\r
2β\r

\u0013\r

π(R + x)\r
β\r

T00(x) , (171)\r
An explicit expression for the modular Hamiltonian of a boosted thermal state can be\r
found in [55].\r

Abstract\r
The AdS/CFT correspondence provides quantum theories of gravity in which\r
spacetime and gravitational physics emerge from ordinary non-gravitational quan\u0002tum systems with many degrees of freedom. Recent work in this context has un\u0002covered fascinating connections between quantum information theory and quan\u0002tum gravity, suggesting that spacetime geometry is directly related to the en\u0002tanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical degrees of freedom\r
and that aspects of spacetime dynamics (gravitation) can be understood from\r
basic quantum information theoretic constraints. In these notes, we provide an\r
elementary introduction to these developments, suitable for readers with some\r
background in general relativity and quantum field theory. The notes are based\r
on lectures given at the CERN Spring School 2014, the Jerusalem Winter School\r

Quantum mechanics is believed to be the basic underlying framework for the physics of\r
our universe. It is the foundation for quantum field theory, which successfully describes\r
the physics of electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions through the Standard\r
Model of Particle Physics. One of the great challenges in theoretical physics over\r
the past decades has been trying to fit gravity, the most universal of all interactions,\r
into this quantum mechanical framework. While apparently of little relevance for\r
understanding everyday gravitational physics, coming up with a quantum theory of\r
gravity is essential in order to understand some of the most fundamental questions in\r
physics, including the physics of the big bang and the nature of black holes.\r
In our modern understanding provided by Einstein’s general relativity, gravity refers\r
to the dynamics of spacetime and its interaction with matter as governed by the Ein\u0002stein Equation. To obtain a quantum version of the theory, the most direct route would\r
seem to be applying standard quantization rules directly to the variables describing\r
spacetime geometry. However, this approach typically runs into various troubles, and\r
there are now deep reasons to believe that the correct route to a quantum theory of\r
gravity must be fundamentally different. Foremost among these is the notion that\r
gravity is “holographic” [1, 2]. That is, given a region of spacetime, the number of\r
degrees of freedom is not proportional to the volume of the region (as is the case in\r
conventional quantum field theories) but rather to the area of the region’s boundary.\r
In this case, quantizing gravity as a local field theory would seem bound to fail, since\r
these local fluctuations of the spacetime geometry cannot be the fundamental degrees\r
of freedom in the same way that local fluctuations of the electromagnetic field represent\r
the fundamental degrees of freedom in electromagnetism.\r
Great progress in our understanding of quantum gravity has come over the past\r
few decades from string theory, culminating in the first complete non-perturbative\r
models of quantum gravity provided by the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. These realize\r
the holographic principle directly: the quantum gravitational theories are defined as\r
ordinary non-gravitational quantum theories (typically quantum field theories) on a\r
fixed lower-dimensional spacetime. How does this work? The basic idea is that each\r
state of the ordinary quantum system encodes all the information about the state of\r
the higher-dimensional gravitational system. As examples, the vacuum state typically\r
corresponds to an empty spacetime, states with some low-energy excitations might\r
correspond to the spacetime with a few gravitational waves, while very highly excited\r
states of the quantum system might correspond to a spacetime with a massive black\r
hole.\r
Since the correspondence was proposed by Maldacena in 1997, there has accumu\u0002lated a great deal of evidence that the conjecture is correct. However, no proof for the\r
correspondence exists, and there remain a number of very basic questions, such as\r
• How and why do spacetime and gravity emerge from CFT physics?\r
• Precisely how is the spacetime geometry and other local gravitational physics\r
encoded in the CFT state?"""

states of a gravitational theory whose spacetimes are asymptotically locally AdS with\r

• Which CFT states correspond to spacetimes with a good classical description (as\r
opposed to e.g. quantum superpositions of different spacetimes).\r
• What are necessary and sufficient conditions for a theory to have a gravity dual?\r
In recent years, it has become clear that to better understand these questions, it is very\r
useful to think about the CFT from the perspective of quantum information theory.\r
There is now a significant amount of evidence that the structure of quantum entan\u0002glement in the CFT state is related directly to the geometrical structure of the dual\r
spacetime. Natural quantum-information theoretic quantities such as entanglement\r
entropy and relative entropy map directly over to natural physical quantities in the\r
gravitational theory. Even aspects of gravitational dynamics can be seen to emerge\r
directly from the physics of entanglement. In these lectures, I will attempt to provide\r
an elementary introduction to some of these exciting recent developments."""

For completeness, we will start with a very rudimentary introduction to AdS/CFT.\r
Some useful reviews include [4, 5] but there are many others. The basic idea here is that\r
certain non-gravitational quantum systems, defined on fixed spacetimes, are equivalent\r
to quantum gravitational theories whose states correspond to different spacetimes with\r
specific asymptotic behavior.2 Each state in the non-gravitational system corresponds\r
to a state in the dual gravitational theory, and each observable in the non-gravitational\r
system corresponds to some observable in the gravitational theory. For both states\r
and observables, the interpretation on the two sides of the correspondence can be\r
completely different. One important exception is total energy: the energy of a CFT\r
state corresponds to the total energy of the spacetime (measured at the classical level\r
by the ADM mass).\r
2Alternatively, we could say that they nonperturbatively define these dual gravitational theories,\r
since there is generally not a complete alternative definition available.\r

d−1 × R, but we are free to choose any\r
geometry.\r
If the CFT is “holographic,” i.e. if there is a dual gravitational theory, the various\r
quantum states of the CFT are each associated with some state of this dual theory, as\r
illustrated in figure 2. The various states may describe different spacetime geometries,\r
but for a specific CFT, the asymptotic behavior of each of these spacetimes is the same.\r
For a CFT on Minkowski space Rd−1,1, the vacuum state of the theory corresponds to\r
(d + 1)-dimensional Anti-de-Sitter spacetime (AdS) with a Minkowski space boundary,\r
which may be described by the metric\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 + dxµdxµ) . (1)\r
This is a maximally symmetric negatively-curved spacetime with curvature set by the\r
length scale ℓ. The spatial geometry is hyperbolic space. The spacetime has a boundary\r
at z = 0 which lies at an infinite proper distance from any point in space, but which\r
light rays can reach and return from in a finite proper time. More general excited\r
states of the CFT are dual to different geometries which approach this geometry as\r
z → 0.4 Explicitly, we can describe these more general geometries as\r
ds2 =\r
ℓ\r
2\r
z\r
2\r
(dz2 + Γµν (x, z)dxµdxν) , (2)\r
where for small z,\r
Γµν (x, z) = ηµν + O(z\r
d\r
) . (3)\r
This description represents a choice of coordinates known as Fefferman-Graham co\u0002ordinates. For states of a CFT defined on a more general spacetime B, the story is\r
similar, except that ηµν in (3) is replaced by the metric describing B.\r
For small perturbations to the vacuum state of the CFT, the corresponding ge\u0002ometries should be represented by small perturbations to AdS, while for high-energy\r
excited states, the corresponding spacetimes can have significantly different geometry\r
and even topology. One important example is the case of a thermal state of the CFT.\r
For the Minkowski-space CFT, the geometry corresponding to a thermal state is the\r
planar AdS black hole. The story is a little more interesting for CFTs defined on a\r
sphere. In this case, there is a deconfinement phase transition in the CFT as the tem\u0002perature is increased, with the low-temperature phase dual to a gas of particles in AdS\r
and the high-temperature phase dual to a spherically-symmetric AdS-Schwarzschild\r
black hole [6].\r
3There are other examples in which the non-gravitational theory is a non-conformal field theory,\r
or even an ordinary quantum mechanical theory with a large number of quantum variables.\r
4More precisely, we expect that only a subset of CFT states correspond to states of the gravitational\r
theory with a simple classical geometrical description. For example, a quantum superposition of two\r
states corresponding to two different geometries would describe a quantum superposition of geometries.\r
3

Figure 2: Different CFT states correspond to different asymptotically AdS geometries.\r
It is interesting in general to understand which CFTs are holographic. There are\r
specific examples (e.g. maximally symmetric large N Yang-Mills theories) for which lots\r
of evidence for a dual gravitational description exists. However, we don’t have a set of\r
necessary and sufficient conditions to tell us whether any particular CFT is holographic.\r
It is believed that having a gravity dual that looks like Einstein gravity coupled to\r
matter requires a CFT with a large number of degrees of freedom (“large N”) and strong\r
coupling. There are also more detailed conditions on the spectrum of states/operators\r
of the theory; roughly, these conditions say that the CFT should have only as many\r
low-energy states as we would expect for a theory of gravity on asymptotically AdS\r
spacetime. On the other hand, it is plausible that any UV-complete theory of quantum\r
gravity on AdS can be associated with a CFT, because the gravitational observables\r
could be used to define a conformal field theory."""

The recent connections between quantum information theory and gravitational physics\r
actually have their roots in the early 1970s with the work of Jacob Bekenstein. In think\u0002ing about black holes in classical general relativity, Bekenstein and others [7, 8] realized\r
that the physics of black hole horizons shares qualitative features with the physics of\r
entropy in thermodynamics. Specifically, horizon area is non-decreasing with time (in\r
the classical limit), and it obeys a relation akin to the first law of thermodynamics,\r
dE = T dS with black hole mass playing the role of energy, 2πT identified with the sur\u0002face gravity κ (a measure of curvature at the horizon) and entropy identified precisely\r
with area as\r
S ↔\r
Area\r
4GN\r
. (4)\r
Based on these observations, Bekenstein made the bold suggestion that the quali\u0002tative similarities were not a coincidence; he postulated that black holes are thermody\u00024

namic systems and that the area of the horizon is the entropy of the black hole. This\r
was quickly confirmed by Hawking’s demonstration [9] that black holes radiate a ther\u0002mal spectrum of particles exactly consistent with the predicted temperature T = κ/2π.\r
However, the underlying statistical interpretation of the entropy as a count of states\r
remained mysterious for decades, since there did not exist a framework to understand\r
the microstates of black holes.\r
Jumping ahead to the present time, we can now understand the microscopic inter\u0002pretation of black hole entropy for black holes in Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, since the\r
AdS/CFT correspondence gives us a complete definition of the underlying quantum\r
theory. From the previous section, a Schwarzschild black hole in Anti-de-Sitter space\r
is identified with a high-energy thermal state of the corresponding CFT on a sphere.\r
Such a theory has a discrete spectrum of energy eigenstates |Eii, and the thermal state\r
corresponds to the usual canonical ensemble. This has a well-defined entropy counting\r
these microstates and (up to a numerical factor which is difficult to compute due to\r
the strong coupling in the CFT) the relation between entropy and temperature for the\r
CFT system is exactly what was predicted for the black hole.\r
To summarize, thermal states of holographic CFTs are dual to Schwarzschild black\r
holes in AdS, and the CFT entropy S corresponds to the horizon area of the black hole\r
(divided by 4GN ). As it turns out, this particular connection between entropy and\r
geometry is just the tip of the iceberg. It admits a massive and beautiful generalization\r
proposed in 2006 by Ryu and Takayanagi. According to our present understanding, for\r
any CFT state corresponding to some asmptotically AdS spacetime with or without a\r
black hole, and for any subsystem of the CFT, the entropy of the subsystem corresponds\r
to a the area of a particular surface in the corresponding spacetime. Before describing\r
this relation in detail and discussing its implications, it will be useful to review in more\r
detail the description of quantum subsystems, and the associated measures of entropy."""

To properly describe the subsystem, we need to use the idea of an ENSEMBLE of\r

Starting from a state Ψ for the full system, it is straightforward to determine the\r

(14), known taking the PARTIAL TRACE over the subsystem A¯, the property (8)\r
holds. This proves the claim that any quantum subsystem can always be represented\r
by an ensemble.\r
It is easy to check that equation (14) also defines a subsystem density matrix (or\r
REDUCED DENSITY MATRIX) with the desired properties in the case when the full\r
system is in an ensemble.\r
Thermodynamic ensembles and entropy\r
The notion of an ensemble is familiar from quantum statistical mechanics.\r
The MICROCANONICAL ENSEMBLE is defined as {(|Eii, pi = 1/n)}, consisting\r
of all energy eigenstates of a system within some small range of energies [E, E + dE],\r
each weighted with equal probability. We consider this ensemble when it is desired\r
to understand the expected values of various physical quantities when only the overall\r
energy for some closed system is known, but not the precise state. Our ignorance of\r
this “microstate” can be quantified by ENTROPY as7\r
S = log n . (15)\r
7We use units for which the Boltzmann constant kB is equal to one.\r
7

This serves as a measure of the number of microstates in the given energy range; the\r
logarithm is chosen so that the entropy of a non-interacting multipart system is the\r
sum of the entropies for the parts. We can think of each state as giving an individual\r
contribution\r
Sstate =\r
1\r
n\r
log n = −p log p (16)\r
to the entropy. Assuming that this contribution to the entropy from such a state is the\r
same for more general ensembles where the probabilities are not all equal (i.e. that the\r
entropy is extensive in the space of states), we obtain the more general definition8\r
S = −\r
X\r
i\r
pilog pi = − tr(ρA log ρA) (17)\r
valid for any ensemble. This general formula allows us to associate an entropy to the\r
ensemble describing any quantum subsystem. This serves as a measure of the classical\r
uncertainty arising from the mixed nature of the subsystem state.\r
Another ensemble familiar from quantum statistical mechanics is the CANONICAL\r
ENSEMBLE or THERMAL STATE of a system. This represents a system A weakly\r
coupled to a heat bath which makes up the remainder A¯ of the full system. The ensem\u0002ble can be defined by maximizing the entropy (17) subject to some fixed expectation\r
value for the energy of the subsystem,\r
tr(ρAHA) = E . (18)\r
In terms of the energy eigenstates |Eii of the Hamiltonian HA, the resulting ensemble is\r
{(|Eii, pi = e\r
−βEi/Z)} where Z =\r
P\r
i\r
e\r
−βEi\r
for β chosen to ensure (18). This parameter\r
defines the temperature of the system via β = 1/T.\r
Entanglement\r
The need to invoke ensembles as a description of quantum subsystems is directly linked\r
to the notion of QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT. Indeed, we can define entanglement\r
by saying that a subsystem A is entangled with the rest of the system if the ensemble\r
describing it has probabilities {pi} 6= 1. When the subsystem is not entangled, there\r
is a single pure state |ψ\r
Ai ∈ HA that describes it. In this case, we can write the state\r
of the full system (assuming it is pure) as\r
|Ψi = |ψ\r
A\r
i ⊗ |ψ\r
A¯\r
i . (19)\r
Thus, entanglement can alternatively be defined as the failure of the full system to be\r
representable as a product state.\r
8The latter formula for the entropy in terms of the density matrix is usually referred to as the\r
VON NEUMANN ENTROPY of a density matrix."""

Some entangled states are more entangled than others. For example, in a system of\r
two spins, the state\r
A| ↑i ⊗ | ↑i + B| ↓i ⊗ | ↓i (20)\r
is not entangled if A or B vanish, and entangled otherwise, but it is sensible to say\r
that the state is more entangled when the magnitudes of A and B are similar than\r
when the state is very close to one of the unentangled states. It is useful to come up\r
with measures to quantify the degree of entanglement for a subsystem.\r
Since having entanglement is the same as having classical uncertainty about the\r
state of the subsystem, one natural measure of entanglement is simply the subsystem\r
entropy (17) that quantifies this classical uncertainty. Since it also serves as a measure\r
of entanglement, this subsystem entropy is alternatively known as ENTANGLEMENT\r
ENTROPY.\r
A more general set of quantities useful in characterizing entanglement are the\r
RENYI ENTROPIES, defined as\r
Sα =\r
1\r
1 − α\r
logX\r
i\r
p\r
α\r
i =\r
1\r
1 − α\r
log tr(ρ\r
α\r
) . (21)\r
These are typically defined for integer α, but by considering general real values of α,\r
we can recover the entanglement entropy in the limit α → 1. The Renyi entropies\r
for the integer values of α tend to be easier to compute than entanglement entropy.\r
Knowing the Renyi entropies for all integer values of α up to the dimension of the\r
Hilbert space is equivalent to knowing the full set of probabilities {pi}, also known as\r
the ENTANGLEMENT SPECTRUM.9\r
Purifications\r
We have seen that given any pure state |Ψi of a quantum system, any subsystem A\r
can be described by a density matrix ρA or equivalently an ensemble {(|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i, pi)}. It is\r
sometimes useful to consider the reverse question: given an ensemble ρA for a quantum\r
system, can we find a pure state of some larger system such that ρA is the reduced\r
density matrix for the subsystem A?\r
In general there are an infinite number of such PURIFICATIONS. For an ensemble\r
ρ = {(|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i, pi)} in a Hilbert space HA, we can describe a general purification by\r
|Ψi =\r
X\r
i\r
√\r
pi|ψ\r
A\r
i\r
i ⊗ |ψ\r
B\r
i\r
i (22)\r
where {|ψ\r
B\r
i\r
i} are an orthogonal set of states in some Hilbert space HB whose dimension\r
is at least as large as the number of non-zero eigenvalues of ρ. The state represented\r

λ\r
D−1\r
tr(ρ) + . . . .\r

in this form is known as a SCHMIDT DECOMPOSITION; it is possible to represent\r
any state of a combined system in this way.\r
Starting from the expression (22) it is useful to note that the ensemble describing\r
the subsystem B has precisely the same probabilities (i.e. entanglement spectrum) as\r
the ensemble describing A. It follows immediately that the entanglement entropy is\r
the same for a subsystem and its complement when the full system is in a pure state.\r
One example of the idea of a purification is the idea that a thermal state (i.e. a\r
system in the canonical ensemble) arises by considering the system weakly coupled to\r
a much larger system known as a heat bath. The full system including the bath is\r
taken to be a pure state and the entropy of the thermal ensemble can be understood\r
as measuring entanglement with the bath.\r
It is sometimes useful to consider a simpler purification of the canonical ensemble,\r
obtained by choosing the purifying system to be a copy of the original system and\r

Let’s now return to thinking about gravity and the AdS/CFT correspondence. We\r
mentioned earlier that a Schwarzschild black hole in AdS is described via AdS/CFT\r
by a high-energy thermal state of the CFT on a sphere, and that the area of the black\r
hole horizon can be identified with the entropy of the CFT.\r
Various observables computed in the CFT thermal state tell us about the black\r
hole spacetime. It is interesting to be more precise and understand which part of the\r
black hole we can learn about. Is it just the region outside the horizon, some of the\r
physics behind the horizon, or the entire maximally extended Schwarzschild geometry\r
(which includes two asymptotic regions connected by a wormhole)?\r
In a 2001 paper [11], Maldacena argued that the maximally extended spacetime,\r
depicted in figure 3, is most naturally associated not with the thermal state of a single\r
CFT, but rather with the thermofield double state (23) of a two-CFT system.10 The\r
geometry has two asymptotic regions, each with its own boundary sphere and its own\r
black hole exterior. Correspondingly, the thermofield double state invoves two separate\r
CFTs on a sphere, each defined on a sphere and in a thermal state. Further, this\r
special purification of the thermal state is symmetrical between the two systems, like\r
the extended black hole geometry.\r
The proposal of Maldacena is very natural but has dramatic implications. The\r
individual terms in the superposition (23) are product states in a system of two non\u0002interacting CFTs. In these states, the two theories have absolutely nothing to do with\r

the two sides of the geometry are connected by smooth classical spacetime in the form\r
of a wormhole. The remarkable conclusion (emphasized in [13, 14]) is that by taking\r
a specific quantum superposition of disconnected spacetimes, we obtain a connected\r
spacetime, as depicted in figure 4. Alternatively, we can say that by entangling the\r
degrees of freedom underlying the two separate gravitational theories in a particular\r
way, we have glued together the corresponding geometries!\r
The extended black hole picture gives us a new way to think about the entropy-area\r
connection for black holes. In the thermofield double state, the black hole entropy is\r
the entropy of a single CFT subsystem or the entanglement entropy measuring the\r
entanglement of the two subsystems with each other. On the gravity side, the horizon\r
is a surface that divides the spatial geometry into two parts, with each part containing\r
one boundary sphere. It is the unique such surface in the spacetime that extremizes\r
the area functional. Thus, denoting the two CFT subsystems as A and A¯, we can\r
restate the entropy-area connection for the black hole as follows: the entropy of the\r
subsystem A (or the entanglement entropy of A) corresponds to the area of the extremal\u0002area surface dividing the bulk geometry into two parts with boundaries A and A¯. This\r
version leads us immediately to the remarkable generalization by Ryu and Takayanagi,\r
which postulates this to hold for any region A in any state with a dual geometry.\r

text = """
In the context of AdS/CFT, the Bekenstein formula provides a geometrical interpreta\u0002tion for the total entropy of a CFT in a high-energy thermal state, identifying it with\r
the area of the horizon of the black hole in the dual spacetime. The formula proposed\r
by Ryu and Takayanagi [15] (and generalized to a covariant version by Hubeny, Ranga\u0002mani, and Takayanagi [16]) suggests an interpretation for the entropy of any spatial\r
subsystem of the CFT, for any CFT state associated with some classical spacetime.\r
To state the proposal, consider a holographic CFT defined on a spacetime geometry\r
B. We suppose that the CFT is in a state |Ψi associated with a classical dual geometry\r
MΨ. We now consider an arbitrary spatial subsystem A of the CFT, defined by first\r
choosing a spatial slice ΣB of B and then choosing a subset A ⊂ ΣB of this slice.\r
The spatial region A can be connected or a union of disconnected regions. Since the\r
boundary geometry ∂MΨ of MΨ is the same as B, we can define regions on ∂MΨ\r
corresponding to ΣB, A, and A¯ ⊂ ΣB (and we will use the same letters to refer to\r
these).\r
Now, let SA be the entropy of the subsystem A i.e. the entanglement entropy\r
measuring the entanglement of fields in A with the the rest of the system. The covariant\r
version of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal states that this entropy equals the area of a\r
certain codimension-2 surface A˜ in MΨ (i.e. d − 1-dimensional for a geometry that is\r
asymptotically AdSd+1)\r
S(A) = 1\r
4GN\r
Area(A˜) . (24)\r
The surface A˜ is defined by the following conditions:\r
• The surface A˜ has the same boundary as A.\r
• The surface A˜ is homologous to A. This means that A and A˜ together form the\r
boundary of some d-dimensional spacelike surface in MΨ. This condition together\r
with the previous condition are equivalent to saying that the surface A˜ divides\r
some bulk spatial slice ending on ΣB into two parts, such that ΣB splits into A\r
and A˜.\r

Figure 5: Geometrical features relevant to the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal. In the dia\u0002gram, the time direction has been suppressed. The left side shows a spatial slice ΣB\r
of the spacetime B on which the CFT lives. The right side shows a spatial slice of the\r
spacetime MΨ dual to the state |Ψi, containing ΣB and the extremal surface A˜.\r
• The surface A˜ extremizes the area functional. If there are multiple such surfaces,\r
A˜ is the one with least area.\r
The proposal is depicted in figure 5. A nice aspect of the proposal is that it relates\r
completely universal quantities on the two sides of the correspondence. Entanglement\r
entropy can be defined for any CFT, while on the gravity side, the area of extremal\r
surfaces is purely geometrical and thus relevant in any gravitational theory.\r
Minimal area surfaces\r
In the special case of a static geometry11, we can ignore the time direction and say\r
that the entanglement entropy for a boundary region A is computed as the area of the\r
minimal-area surface in the bulk space with the same boundary as A. This was the\r
original Ryu-Takayanagi proposal before the covariant generalization above.\r
More generally, assuming the geometry MΨ satisfies the null energy condition, the\r
covariant prescription above is equivalent finding the minimal-area surface on a spatial\r
slice Σ bounded by ΣB, but then maximizing this area over all possible slices Σ [17].\r
This “maximin” construction turns out to be very useful in proving certain results\r
about holographic entanglement entropy.\r
QFT entanglement and divergences\r
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula as it is usually stated is somewhat ill-defined, since both\r
sides of the equation actually represent divergent quantities. On the gravity side, the\r
area A˜ is divergent because there is an infinite proper distance to the boundary of AdS.\r
11More generally, these comments apply to a geometry with time reflection symmetry about a spatial\r
slice ending on ΣB when we restrict to this slice.\r
13

To understand the divergence on the field theory side, note that the subsystem we\r
are talking about (i.e. the subset of field degrees of freedom living in some spatial\r
region A) actually contains an infinite number of degrees of freedom, since we have\r
field modes with arbitrarily short wavelengths. The field modes on either side of\r
the region boundary ∂A are coupled to each other by the field theory Hamiltonian,\r
and are entangled with each other in the field theory ground state. Summing the\r
contribution to the entanglement entropy from these infinite number of modes, we\r
obtain a divergence typically proportional to the area of the boundary of A for two or\r
more spatial dimensions.\r
To make a sense out of the RT formula, we have several options. First, we can\r
work with a UV cutoff in the field theory at some high scale 1/ǫ. In the AdS/CFT\r
correspondence, this corresponds to an IR cutoff, where we keep only the z > ǫ part\r
of the geometry. With the explicit cutoff, both the CFT entanglement and the area\r
on the gravity side become finite, and when explicit calculations are possible, the two\r
results can be shown to match, up to terms which vanish as the cutoff is removed. We\r
will give one explicit example of this matching below.\r
Alternatively, we can take the usual approach in quantum field theory and work\r
with quantities that remain finite as the cutoff is removed. There are several options"""

This is indeed the known relation between the central charge and the gravitational\r
parameters for examples of the AdS3/CF T2 correspondence. It can be established\r
independently by comparing other physical observables such as the relation between\r
entropy and temperature in thermal states.\r
The agreement here is actually more than we would have expected in general. In\r
general, we would expect gravity calculations to be reproduced only for CFTs with a\r
gravity dual description. It just happens that the result for the entanglement entropy\r
of a single interval takes the same form for all CFTs. For more general quantities, such\r
as the entanglement entropy of a union of disjoint intervals, the CFT result depends on\r
the details of the CFT, and only for special holographic CFTs does the result match\r
with a gravity calculation [19, 20].\r
As we discussed earlier, while the result (32) is cutoff-dependent, there are various\r
UV finite quantities that we can derive from this:\r
1. First, we can take combinations of entanglement entropies for which the diver\u0002gences cancel. An example is provided by the mutual information for a holo\u0002graphic CFT in the vacuum state between two intervals A and B, which we\r
will take to be of length L separated by distance R. In this case, the mutual\r
information is\r
I(A : B) = S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B) (34)\r
16

where from (32), we have\r
S(A) = S(B) = c\r
3\r
log L\r
ǫ\r
. (35)\r
To calculated S(A∪B) holographically, we actually need to consider two different\r
possible extremal surfaces with boundary ∂(A∪B), both a disconnected union of\r
two parts, as shown in figure 6. For R > (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L, the minimal-area extremal\r
surface is simply the union of surfaces A˜ and B˜ computing S(A) and S(B), so\r
the mutual information vanishes (at leading order in 1/N). For R < (\r
√\r
2 − 1)L,\r
the alternative (red) extremal surface has less area. Thus, we have\r

which is finite, as promised, and has an interesting first order phase transition as\r

2. We can also consider the entanglement entropy for excited states, subtracting off\r
the vacuum entanglement entropy for the same region. For example, consider\r
the thermal state of the CFT with temperature β. The entanglement entropy in\r
this state can be calculated [18] using a similar path-integral approach as for the\r

Here, we mention a few pieces of evidence for the correctness of the Ryu-Takayanagi\r
proposal.\r
We have already seen that the formula is correct when applied to an interval in the\r
vacuum state or a thermal state of a holographic 2D CFT. Similar agreement can be\r
shown for the case of multiple intervals in the vacuum state of holographic 2D CFTs\r
[19, 20], for an interval in the thermal state of 2D CFTs, for ball-shaped regions in the\r
vacuum of higher-dimensional CFTs [23], for ball-shaped regions in CFTs deformed by\r
relevant operators [24], and for certain shape-deformations of these ball-shaped regions\r
(see e.g. [25]).\r
In general, direct calculational checks are limited by our ability to calculated en\u0002tanglement entropy in strongly coupled CFTs. However, it is possible to provide a\r
general argument for the validity of the proposal starting directly from the assumed\r
equivalence between the CFT and gravity partition functions that lies at the heart\r
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The argument makes use of the fact that the CFT\r
entanglement entropy is a limiting case of the Renyi entropies (21). As explained in\r
appendix C, these can be calculated by evaluating the CFT path integral on a multi\u0002sheeted Euclidean space defined by gluing multiple copies of the original boundary\r
space together across the regions for which the entropy is being evaluated. According\r
to the AdS/CFT correspondence, this field theory path integral should equal the path\r
integral for the gravity theory on asymptotically AdS spacetimes with boundary ge\u0002ometry equal to the multi-sheeted space appearing in the CFT path integral. In the\r
classical limit, the gravity path integral is dominated by a single saddle-point geome\u0002try, which is the solution to the classical gravitational equations with these boundary\r
conditions. The result is then e\r
−Sgrav evaluated for this solution. Thus, we have a\r
way in principle to compute Renyi entropies and therefore entanglement entropies by\r
solving a gravity problem, without assuming the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. In general,\r
finding the required solutions to compute the Renyi entropy Sn would be a difficult\r
problem requiring numerics. However, in the limit n → 1 needed to compute entan\u0002glement entropies, Lewkowycz and Maldacena have argued (in the case of static or\r
time-reflection symmetric spacetimes) [26] that the problem reduces to precisely the\r
problem of computing extremal surface areas in the original geometry. The argument\r
has recently been extended to the time-dependent case by [27].\r

Figure 7: Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces computing entanglement entropy for complemen\u0002tary regions A and A¯ in the thermal state on S\r
d dual to a black hole. For small enough\r
A, the minimal-area extremal surface corresponding to A˜ becomes the union of A˜ with\r
the black hole horizon.\r
Entanglement entropy for complementary subsystems\r
The holographic entanglement entropy formula also obeys various consistency checks.\r
We recall that for any pure state of a system with subsystems A and A¯, the entangle\u0002ment entropy of A matches with the entanglement entropy of A¯:\r
S(A) = S(A¯) |ΨiA∪A¯ pure (41)\r
In the RT formula, the calculation of the entanglement entropy for a region A involves\r
finding the minimal area bulk extremal surface whose boundary is the same as the\r
boundary of A. But the boundary of A¯ is the same as the boundary of A. Thus, the\r
minimal-area extremal surface is the same for both cases, and we will get the same\r
entanglement entropy, provided that such a surface is homologous to both A and A¯.\r
The latter condition requires that A and A¯ are homologous in the full geometry, which\r
is equivalent to saying that the bulk geometry has no boundary components other than\r
A ∪ A¯.\r
An example where A and A¯ can fail to be homologous is the case where the bulk\r
geometry is a black hole. For example, in the maximally extended black hole geometry,\r
A will not be homologous to A¯ since there is a second asymptotic region with its own\r
boundary. In this case, the entanglement entropy for A and A¯ will be computed by\r
separate surfaces (see figure 7) and will generally be different. But this is exactly what\r
we expect, since the state of the CFT on A ∪ A¯ is no longer pure so (41) doesn’t apply.\r
An interesting example is provided by the case where A is a small region and A¯\r
makes up the remainder of the sphere, with the CFT on the sphere taken to be in\r
some high-energy thermal state. In this case, the extremal surface corresponding to\r
the region A will remain close to the AdS boundary. For A¯ even though the boundary\r
of A¯ is small, the extremal surface must “wrap around” the black hole (as shown in\r
figure 7) in order to be homologous to A¯. In this case, it turns out that the minimal\r
area extremal surface is actually not connected, but rather a disconnected surface made\r
up of the union of A˜ with the black hole horizon. In this case we have the interesting\r
19

relation that\r
S(A¯) = S(A) + SBH . (42)\r
Subadditivity and mutual information\r
For general quantum systems with disjoint subsystems A and B, it is straightforward\r
to demonstrate that13\r
I(A; B) ≡ S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B) ≥ 0 (43)\r
This quantity, known as MUTUAL INFORMATION is a measure of entanglement and\r
correlations between the two subsystems A and B. The fact that it is always positive\r
is known as the SUBADDITIVITY of entanglement entropies. Mutual information\r
provides an upper bound for all correlations between the two subsystems; if OA and\r
OB are two bounded operators acting on HA and HB, it can be shown that [28]\r
(hOAOBi − hOAihOBi)\r
2\r
2|hOAi|2|hOBi|2\r
≤ I(A; B) . (44)\r
In a CFT, taking A and B to be disjoint spatial subsystems, the combination of\r
entanglement entropies in 43 is finite, so the positivity constraint is meaningful. Using\r
the holographic formula (24) this translates to a condition on the areas of surfaces; as\r
a consistency check, we should verify that this is satisfied. Given the extremal surfaces\r
A˜ and B˜ for A and B, the surface A˜∪B˜ is an extremal surface with the same boundary\r
as A ∪ B. The surface that computes the entanglement entropy S(A ∪ B) is defined\r
to be the minimal-area extremal surface with the same boundary as A ∪ B. Thus, its\r
area must be less than or equal to the area of of A˜ ∪ B˜, and the subadditivity relation\r
(43) follows immediately.\r
Strong subadditivity\r
More constraints arise when we consider additional subsystems. For general quantum\r
systems with disjoint subsystems A, B, and C entanglement entropy obeys the relation\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C) ≥ 0 , (45)\r
known as STRONG SUBADDITIVITY. This can be reexpressed in terms of mutual\r
information as\r
I(A; B ∪ C) ≥ I(A; B) , (46)\r
i.e. that the mutual information between A and the combined system BC must be\r
larger than the mutual information between A and B. This sounds very plausible, but\r
it turns out that the proof of strong subadditivity is rather difficult.\r
Again, we can ask whether the holographic formula for entanglement entropy re\u0002spects this. For static geometries and regions A, B, and C all on a preferred time slice,\r
13For a more detailed discussion on the entanglement constraints in this and later sections, see [10].\r
20

where we can use the original RT formula, the geometrical version of strong subaddi\u0002tivity may be easily demonstrated to hold for any geometry, as shown by Headrick and\r
Takayanagi [29]. If we consider regions on more general time slices, or time-dependent\r
geometries, the strong subadditivity relation is much more difficult to demonstrate, and\r
in fact only holds when the geometry satisfies certain conditions. While the necessary\r
conditions on the geometry are not known in general, it has been shown that the null\r
energy condition is sufficient [17]."""

expect some version of the RT formula to hold even away from this limit of classical\r
Einstein gravity.\r
For classical theories of gravity which are not Einstein gravity, there is a well\u0002known generalization of the entropy-area connection for black holes due to Wald [30].\r
In this case, area is replaced by a more general covariant quantity calculated for the\r
black hole horizon. The appropriate quantity can be determined directly from the\r
form of the gravitational Lagrangian. It is natural to suppose that this more general\r
quantity also replaces area in the holographic entanglement formula. It turns out that\r
the full story is slightly more complicated, since there can be additional terms that\r
make no contribution when evaluated on a black hole horizon. However, there are now\r
precise proposals [31, 32] for the correct quantity, based on the Lewkowycz-Maldacena\r
derivation of the RT formula applied to these more general theories.\r
Away from large N, there will also be quantum effects in the bulk theory. The lead\u0002ing corrections to the classical limit are captured by “semiclassical gravity,” in which\r
we include the effects of quantum fluctuations of the metric and other fields via a quan\u0002tum field theory living on the spacetime geometry. At this level of approximation, we\r
can think of CFT states |Ψi as corresponding to some geometry M plus some quan\u0002tum field theory state |ψbulki defined on M. On the CFT side, effects associated with\r
these quantum field fluctuations correspond to 1/N corrections. For the entanglement\r
entropy, this means that the entanglement entropy will have some leading asymptotic\r
behavior in large N plus subleading terms suppressed by powers of 1/N. Faulkner,\r
Leukowycz, and Maldacena have proposed [33] that the leading 1/N correction to en\u0002tanglement entropy in the field theory corresponds to the entanglement entropy of the\r
bulk quantum fields across the extremal surface A˜\r

We conclude this section with some qualitative remarks on the plausible implications\r
of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.\r
Reconstructing the geometry\r
An important implication of the holographic entanglement entropy formula is that\r
much of the dual spacetime geometry for a holographic CFT state is encoded in the\r
entanglement structure of the state. In principle, we can recover the dual spacetime\r
geometry by calculating entanglement entropies for many different regions and then\r
finding a geometry M whose extremal surface areas match with the entropies. This\r
should be a highly overconstrained problem, since the entanglement entropies give us\r
some function on the space of subsets of the boundary spacetime, while geometries M\r
are specified by a handful of functions of a few coordinates (a much smaller space).\r
Thus, for a general state in a general CFT, we should expect that no geometry will\r
reproduce all the entanglement entropies.\r
Having a geometrical dual will therefore require a very special structure of entan\u0002glement for the CFT state. Given such a state, we can expect that the entanglement\r
entropies fix the geometry uniquely, with some limitations. Most importantly, there\r
can be regions of a spacetime, such as the region behind the horizon of a black hole,\r
where no extremal surface penetrates. If a CFT state is dual to some geometry with\r
such a region, known as the ENTANGLEMENT SHADOW (see e.g. [34] for a dis\u0002cussion), we will clearly not be able to learn about this region by computing spatial\r
entanglement entropies. It may be that the information about the geometry in these\r
regions may be contained in more general types of entanglement (see e.g. [35, 36]).14\r
Spacetime from entanglement\r
In the example of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole, the the two CFTs\r
have nothing to do with one another except that their states are entangled via the\r
thermofield double state. In that example, it is clear that this entanglement is a nec\u0002essary condition for the two asymptotic regions of the dual spacetime to be connected.\r
Without entanglement, we have a product state in two non-interacting systems, and\r
the only possible interpretation would be two disconnected spacetimes.\r
14It is possible to associate an entanglement entropy to any subalgebra of the full algebra of observ\u0002ables for a quantum system. The entanglement entropies that we have discussed so far correspond to\r
the full subalgebra of operators associated to spatial regions, but there are more general possibilities.\r
See [37] for some examples and the appendix of [38] for a general review.\r

Figure 8: Effect on the dual spatial geometry of disentangling the two hemispheres\r
starting from the vacuum state of a CFT on S\r
d\r
. Note that it is actually the bulk\r
metric is changing, with the boundary metric remaining fixed.\r
Motivated by this, it is interesting to ask whether even in simpler spacetimes, dual to\r
states of a single CFT, the connectedness of the geometry is related to the large amount\r
of entanglement present in low-energy CFT states. To probe this, we can consider the\r
following thought experiment [13, 14]. Starting with the vacuum state of a CFT on the\r
sphere, imagine arbitrarily dividing the sphere into two hemispheres. Now, consider\r
a one parameter family of CFT states for which the entanglement between the two\r
hemispheres decreases from the initial value in the vacuum state. What happens to\r
the dual spacetime?\r
Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we learn that as the entanglement between the\r
two sides decreases, the area of the surface dividing the two sides of the bulk spacetime\r
decreases. A separate argument suggests that the two sides also become further and\r
further apart. Thus, the picture is that the spatial geometry of the corresponding\r
spacetime stretches apart and pinches off in the middle, as shown in figure 8. This\r
picture can be checked by explicit calculations in some one parameter families of states\r
[39]. Thus, by removing the entanglement between the two halves of the CFT, it\r
appears that we are able to pull apart the corresponding spacetime. We can go further,\r
subdividing the boundary into more regions and removing the entanglement between\r
these. As we will see in more detail below, the result is that the spacetime splits up\r
into many small disconnected fragments. By removing all the entanglement (which, for\r
the case of a continuum CFT, costs an infinite amount of energy), the dual spacetime\r
disappears entirely!\r
These qualitative arguments suggest a rather remarkable conclusion: quantum en\u0002tanglement between the underlying degrees of freedom is crucial for the existence of\r
classical spacetime. We might even interpret the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as telling us\r
that spacetime is a geometrical representation of the entanglement structure of a CFT\r
state [40, 13].15\r
15There are many caveats to such a conclusion. It is an open question whether spacetime geometry\r
in the entanglement shadow, e.g. behind black hole horizons, can be understood this way. Also, there\r
are examples of holographic duality where the field theory is a simple matrix quantum mechanics. In\r
this case, there are no spatial subsystems, so a connection between entanglement and geometry would\r
have to be based on a more general type of entanglement within the system, such as those mentioned\r
in the previous footnote.\r

In this section, we will begin to take a closer look at entanglement and other quantum\u0002information theoretic quantities in quantum field theories in order to understand how\r
they are related to features of the dual spacetime geometries and to gravitational\r
physics in these spacetimes.\r
Domains of dependence\r
Consider a local quantum field theory on some spacetime B. To define a spatial sub\u0002system, we first choose a spatial slice ΣB and then let A be a subset of this spatial\r
slice. This subset can be connected or disconnected. The fields in A represent a subset\r
of the degrees of freedom of the quantum field theory. This is most clear in a lattice\r
regularization, where we have degrees of freedom associated with specific points. There\r
are subtleties in the case of gauge theories; for more discussion on these, see [41, 42].\r
In a relativistic quantum field theory, there is a spacetime region DA that is canon\u0002ically associated with the spatial subsystem A. To define DA, we note that for some\r
spacetime points p in B, all causal (i.e. timelike or lightlike) curves through p neces\u0002sarily pass through A. The region DA is the collection of all such points, known as the\r
DOMAIN OF DEPENDENCE of A, or alternatively as the causal development region\r
or causal diamond associated with A. This is illustrated in figure 9.\r
At the classical level, the domain of dependence is important because it is the region\r
where the solution of any relativistic field equation is fully determined given initial data\r
on A. Changes to the fields in A¯ ⊂ SΣB cannot affect this region. At the quantum\r
level, any operator in DA can be expressed in terms of the field operators living on\r
the region A, making use of the field theory Hamiltonian to evolve field operators\r
backwards and forwards in time. Operators in DA commute with operators localized\r
in A¯ or DA¯.\r
The domain of dependence DA associated with a region A is also the domain of\r
dependence for an infinite number of other spatial regions, essentially any spacelike\r
surface in DA whose boundary is the same as the boundary of A, as in figure 10. The\r
density matrix associated with any of these other regions contains the same information\r
as the density matrix associated with ρA, so it is useful to think of ρA as being a density"""

The full set of operators with support in A forms a closed algebra of observables\r

The representation (48) suggests a natural decomposition of the quantum informa\u0002tion associated with the full state as\r
|Ψi → ρA + ρA¯ + entanglement info . (49)\r
Here, it is important to note that the pair of density matrices ρA, ρA¯ represent only\r
a subset of the information contained in the state |Ψi. The rest of the information is\r
contained in the details of how the two subsystems are entangled with one another in\r
(48).\r
In our discussion below, we will see that there is a natural spacetime analog to\r
the decomposition (49). This can be motivated by noting that the representation (48)\r
bears a formal similarity to the CFT description of the two-sided black hole, where (as\r
we will argue below) the split (49) corresponds to the natural spacetime decomposition\r
into the outside-the-horizon regions on the two sides plus the black hole interior.\r
Density matrix for a half-space\r
In general, it is difficult to describe the density matrix for a spatial subsystem of a\r
quantum field theory, even for the vacuum state. One special exception is the case of\r
a half-space (e.g. x > 0, where x is one of the spatial coordinates) of Minkowski space,\r
whose domain of dependence is known as a RINDLER WEDGE. We can describe the\r
Rindler wedge as {x > 0, |t| < x} or alternatively as the region {r > 0} in the metric\r

The fact that the density matrix is thermal with respect to this Hamiltonian which\r
generates evolution on accelerated trajectories is related to the result of Unruh that\r
an accelerated observer observing the vacuum state will see a thermal spectrum of\r
particles.\r
We can also consider the complementary Rindler wedge, associated with the spatial\r
region x < 0. The density matrix for this region is also thermal, with respect to the\r
Hamiltonian Hη\r
′ generating boosts in this complementary wedge. The full vacuum\r
state of the CFT can be understood as an entangled state between the field theories\r
defined on the two Rindler wedges. In fact, it is exactly the thermofield double state\r

In the case of a free field theory, we can define modes of the fields living in each\r
of the wedges, and build the energy eigenstates of Hη and Hη\r
′ on the respective sides\r
by occupying these modes. In this case, we find that in the vacuum state (57), each\r
mode in one wedge is entangled with the corresponding mode in the other wedge. We\r
can also consider states in which this entanglement is removed, i.e. a product state\r
between the two wedges. For these states, we find that the stress tensor is singular at\r
x = t = 0 and on the boundaries of the two Rindler wedges. Thus, entanglement of the\r
field theory modes on either side of the x = 0 surface (or any other surface) is crucial\r
to obtain a well-behaved field theory state.\r
Density matrix for a ball-shaped region in a CFT\r
A Rindler wedge can be related by a conformal transformation to the domain of depen\u0002dence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski space.17 In a conformal field theory, such\r
a transformation is associated with a mapping of states that leaves the vacuum state\r
invariant. Thus, the vacuum density matrix for a ball-shaped region is the image under\r
the conformal transformation of the vacuum density matrix (52) for the Rindler wedge.\r
The Rindler density matrix is expressed directly in terms of a symmetry generator Hη;\r
this maps under the conformal transformation to the generator of a symmetry that\r

a region θ < θ0 in polar coordinates) and the complementary ball B¯. Choosing some\r
point P on the boundary of B, let Dp¯ be the domain of dependence region of S\r

t − P\r

Dp¯ to Minkowski space, taking DB and DB¯ to complementary Rindler wedges (defined\r
as the domain of dependence of a half space), as shown in figure 12.\r
This conformal transformation maps the vacuum state on the sphere to the vacuum\r
state on Minkowski space. Thus, as in the previous section, the vacuum density matri\u0002ces for the balls B and B¯ are related by the conformal transformation to the vacuum\r
density matrix of the half space. Again, we have symmetry generators HB and HB¯\r
defining a notion of time evolution in DB and DB¯ such that the density matrices for\r
the two regions are ρB = exp(−HB)/Z and ρB¯ = exp(−HB¯ /Z). Furthermore, using\r

d maps to an\r
entangled state of a pair of CFTs on Hd. Specifically, the vacuum state maps to the\r
thermofield double state with temperature T = 1/(2πRH), with each of the CFTs in a\r

Our experience with thermal states of a holographic CFT on Minkowski space or on\r
a sphere might suggest that these hyperbolic space thermal states have something to do\r
with black hole dual geometries. On the other hand, the hyperbolic space thermofield\r
double state we have arrived at is simply an alternative description of the CFT vacuum\r
state on a sphere, which is dual to pure global AdS spacetime. This apparent tension\r
can be resolved by noting that there is a way to think of pure global AdS spacetime as\r
a black hole.\r
To understand this, we note that any thermal state of a CFT on hyperbolic space\r
is indeed dual to an AdS-Schwarzshild black hole, but this time with a non-compact\r

wedge of AdS in the sense that it is the bulk domain of dependence of a half-space\r
bounded by the extremal surface B˜.\r
We now see that pure global AdS can be thought of as a maximally extended black\r

We have seen that given a ball-shaped region B on the sphere, we can represent the\r
CFT vacuum state as an entangled state between B and B¯, where the density matrices\r
ρB and ρB¯ are thermal density matrices for a particular temperature, and the full state\r
is the thermofield double state. On the bulk side, this decomposition of the quantum\r
state naturally corresponds to a decomposition of global AdS into two complementary\r
Rindler wedges plus a behind-the-horizon region; we will now explain this in more\r
detail.\r
To motivate this correspondence, let us consider a somewhat more general question\r
[43, 44, 45]: given a state |Ψi dual to some geometry M, and given the reduced density\r
matrix ρA calculated from this state for a subsystem A, what information about the\r
dual spacetime is contained in A?\r
Since AdS/CFT is a non-local duality, there is no reason a priori that ρA should tell\r
us about any particular subset of the dual geometry. It could be that the information\r
about any local region in the dual spacetime is completely spread throughout the CFT\r
degrees of freedom. In this case, no spatial CFT subsystem would contain all the\r
information about the bulk region. However, we will now argue that ρA does encode\r
the information about the bulk physics in a particular subset of the dual geometry\r
naturally associated with the domain of dependence region DA.\r
We note first that given the density matrix ρA, we can compute the expectation\r
value of any local or nonlocal CFT observable contained within DA. We can also calcu\u0002late more general quantities, such as the entanglement entropies of spatial subsystems\r
within DA. Through the AdS/CFT dictionary, these provide information about the\r
dual geometry.\r
The causal wedge\r
As an example, we can consider response functions in the CFT, i.e. two point functions\r
at timelike separated points contained within DA. We can think of these as perturbing\r
the system at the location of the earlier operator and then measuring the response at\r
the location of the later operator. In the bulk picture, we can think of this operation as\r
making a perturbation at the boundary of AdS that propagates causally into the bulk\r
and then measuring the response of this perturbation at the AdS boundary at some\r
later time. The subset of the bulk geometry sensitive to this kind of measurement is\r
the intersection of the causal future of DA (the region to which we can send a signal)\r
and the causal past of DA (the region from which we can receive a signal). This is\r
known as the CAUSAL WEDGE associated with the subsystem A.\r
By measuring response functions and other CFT observables, it is very plausible\r
that we can recover the physics in the causal wedge. For example, we can imagine\r
inserting an arbitrarily small mirror anywhere in the causal wedge; this would have\r
a significant effect on certain response functions, since now light signals from certain\r
boundary points would bounce directly back to other boundary points creating a very\r
different response. Perturbatively around AdS, we can even write explicit CFT expres\u000230

Figure 13: The causal wedge associated with DA (shaded) is the region for which an\r
observer restricted to the boundary region DA can send a signal to and receive a signal\r
back. Regions of spacetime causally connected to DA¯ cannot be described by density\r
matrix ρA since we can have perturbations that do not affect ρA altering the spacetime\r
anywhere in this region (e.g. via the light wave denoted in red).\r
sions corresponding to bulk operators in this causal wedge. For a ball-shaped region\r
on the boundary of pure AdS, the causal wedge is precisely the Rindler wedge RB\r
discussed above.\r
An upper bound on the size of the region dual to ρA\r
We can place a useful upper bound on the size of the region encoded in ρA as fol\u0002lows. Consider a perturbation to the field theory state which takes the form |Ψi →\r
UA¯ ⊗ 11A|Ψi. For the perturbed state, the density matrix ρA is the same as for the\r
unperturbed state, while the density matrix ρA¯ is generally changed. As an example,\r
consider local perturbations contained within DA¯. These correspond to bulk pertur\u0002bations near the boundary of AdS which can propagate causally into the geometry, as\r
for the red signal coming from the left in figure 13. In general, the region of the bulk\r
affected by such perturbations is the union of the causal future and the causal past of\r
DA¯, J\r
+(DA¯)∪J\r
−(DA¯). Since we can alter this region without altering ρA, we concluded\r
that the region dual to ρA must be contained in the complement of J\r
+(DA¯)∪J−(DA¯).18\r
In the case of pure AdS and a region B on the boundary, the complement of\r
J\r
+(DB¯ ) ∪ J\r
−(DB¯ ) is again the Rindler wedge RB, so in this case, it seems that the\r
information contained in ρB corresponds precisely to bulk information about the physics\r
inside the Rindler wedge RB.\r
18We can enlarge this by replacing DA¯ with any bulk region that can be affected by changes in ρA¯\r
that do not affect ρA.\r
31

For a generic spacetime, the causal wedge of a region A is generally smaller than\r
the complement of J\r
+(DA¯) ∪ J−(DA¯). Thus it is possible, and, as we will now see,\r
plausible, that the region dual to ρA is actually larger than the causal wedge.\r
The entanglement wedge\r
Another type of quantity that we can compute using the density matrix ρA is the set\r
of entanglement entropies for spatial regions contained within DA. According to the\r
RT/HRT formulas, these tell us about the areas of various extremal surfaces in the\r
bulk geometry. For larger boundary regions, the extremal surfaces generally penetrate\r
deeper into the bulk.19 The deepest such surface is the surface A˜ that calculates the\r
entanglement entropy of the whole region A. For a generic asymptotically AdS space\u0002time, it turns out that this surface (and many other surfaces corresponding to large\r
subsystems in DA) lies outside the causal wedge. Since the density matrix contains\r
information about the areas of all of these surfaces, it seems likely that the density\r
matrix ρA is dual to a larger region than just the causal wedge. Motivated by these\r
observations, it has been proposed [44, 17, 46] that the relevant region is the ENTAN\u0002GLEMENT WEDGE, defined to be the domain of dependence of any spatial bulk\r
region which has A˜ as one boundary component and the remaining boundary compo\u0002nent some Cauchy surface in DA. There have been various arguments supporting the\r
validity of this claim.20\r
One nice feature of the entanglement wedge proposal is that for a pure state of the\r

their entanglement entropies, the entanglement wedges for these complementary regions\r
meet at the surface A˜. Thus, the spacetime naturally divides up into the two wedges\r

extended black hole geometry. Note that the common information between the two\r
density matrices ρA and ρA¯ is the spectrum of non-zero eigenvalues, which allows us\r
to compute the entanglement entropy common to the two density matrices. It is thus\r
natural that the common information between the two wedges is the surface A˜, whose\r
geometry allows us to compute the entanglement entropy holographically.21\r
Note that for the case of pure AdS, the causal wedge and the entanglement wedge\r
coincide, but generically, the entanglement wedge is larger.22\r
19In fact, assuming the bulk geometry satisfies the null energy condition, it has been proven that\r
the surface moves outward spatially as the size of the region is increased [17].\r

Aside: Black holes and firewalls\r
In 2012 and subsequently, there was a great deal of discussion following a paper [48]\r
of Almheiri, Marolf Polchinski, and Sully (AMPS) on the issue of whether black hole\r
horizons are smooth as is expected from classical general relativity, or whether some\r
quantum effects lead to singular behavior there.\r
The argument in ([48]) very roughly goes as follows; see the paper for details. In\r
order to have smooth spacetime at a black hole horizon, we must have entanglement\r
between the quantum field theory modes inside and outside the horizon as in our dis\u0002cussion of Rindler space above. As a black hole evaporates, it becomes entangled with\r
its outgoing Hawking radiation. For a sufficiently old black hole, this entanglement\r
becomes maximal. The inside-the-horizon modes must then be entangled with some\r
radiation subsystem and therefore (due to basic “monogamy” constraints on entangle\u0002ment) cannot also have the entanglement with the outside-the-horizon modes required\r
to ensure a nonsingular space. Thus, the horizon of an old black hole must be singular\r
i.e. a firewall.\r
Many arguments for and against firewalls appeared in the literature in the months\r
and years following the AMPS paper. Summarizing these would be beyond the scope\r
of the current notes; however, I’ll mention a couple of interesting connections to the\r
discussion in this section.\r
34

First, there is a possible way to avoid the firewall conclusion proposed by Maldacena\r
and Susskind [49] using some of the ideas discussed above. As we have discussed, in\r
the example of the maximally-extended AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, the spacetime\r
behind the horizon is encoded in the structure of entanglement between the two CFTs.\r
From the bulk point of view, we can interpret this entanglement as being between the\r
black holes in the two separate asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Thus, the existence of\r
smooth spacetime behind the horizon actually requires the entanglement of the black\r
hole with some other system. If something like this is also true in the AMPS example\r
of an evaporating black hole, it might be that the entanglement of the black hole with\r
its outgoing radiation does not forbid a smooth spacetime behind the horizon, but\r
rather is somehow the origin of it!25\r
The best chance for a compelling argument for or against the firewall proposal is\r
within the context of a complete quantum theory of gravity. Thus, it is interesting to\r
ask whether black holes as described in the AdS/CFT correspondence have firewalls.26\r
The following argument [50] (see also [51] for a closely related argument) suggests that\r
either these black holes have firewalls, or that there is no state-independent observable\r
in the CFT that can be used to learn about the geometry behind the horizon.\r
Consider a high-temperature canonical ensemble ρthermal of states in a holographic\r
CFT. Typical states in this ensemble correspond to large black hole microstates in\r
AdS. Outside their horizons, we expect that the geometry for each of these states is\r
well-approximated by the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. We would like to ask whether\r
the black holes corresponding to these microstates have smooth spacetime behind their\r
horizon. Suppose that 1) typical states have smooth spacetime behind their horizon and\r
2) there is some bounded CFT operator O that we can use to verify this (e.g. hOi = 1\r
if an observer on some particular trajectory encounters some smooth spacetime behind\r
the black hole horizon and less than one otherwise).\r
In this case, we must have tr(ρthermalO) = 1: the expectation value in the canonical\r
ensemble should match with the expectation value in typical states since the canonical\r
ensemble is dominated by these states. The same result will hold for any purification\r
of ρthermal to some state of a larger system. Thus, we would conclude that the full\r
spacetime dual to any such purification would also have smooth spacetime behind the\r
horizon. This is certainly expected to be true for the thermofield double state, which\r
is dual to the maximally extended black hole geometry. However, it will not be true\r
for other purifications; for example, various states of the form UL ⊗ 11R|ΨiT F D will\r
correspond to perturbations to the maximally extended black hole geometry in which\r
a perturbation falling into the black hole on the left will be detected as a shockwave\r
25We have argued that entanglement between fundemental degrees of freedom underlies the connec\u0002tivity of spacetime. Maldacena and Susskind’s suggestion in [49] is that not only is this entanglement\r
a necessary condition for connectedness, it is also sufficient. That is, they propose that any time two\r
subsystems are entangled (e.g. the black hole with its Hawking radiation), there is some geometrical\r
connection (they envision a “wormhole” connecting the black hole exterior with the radiation system).\r
This is known as the “ER=EPR” (Einstein-Rosen equals Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) proposal.\r
26In the case of large AdS black holes, the black holes do not evaporate, but rather are in thermal\r
equilibrium with their Hawking radiation.\r
35

Figure 15: Two different purifications of a high-temperature thermal state ρR for a\r
CFT on S\r
d\r
. In the thermofield double, the geometry behind the black hole horizon on\r
the right is smooth, while in the perturbed state on the right, there will be a shockwave\r
behind the horizon. In either case, the density matrix ρR represents the ensemble of\r
single-sided black hole microstates. Thus, there cannot be a single operator\r
immediately behind the black hole horizon on the right, as shown in figure 15. Thus,\r
there will be states for which tr(ρthermalO) = 1 but the spacetime behind the black\r
hole horizon is not smooth, contradicting our assumptions.\r
We conclude that either the typical black hole microstates do not all have smooth\r
spacetime behind their horizon, or the CFT operators used to probe behind-the-horizon\r
physics are state-dependent, i.e. there is no single operator O that we can use for all\r
CFT states to find out if there is smooth geometry.27 For more discussion on the issue\r
of state dependence, see [53] and references therein."""

We have seen that the entanglement structure of CFT states is directly linked to the\r

It is not hard to see that geometries which capture the entanglement entropies\r

already seen that entanglement entropies in general quantum systems are constrained,\r

theories. In the next subsection, we will understand how these constraints applied to\r
holographic CFTs translate to gravitational constraints.\r
The first law of entanglement\r
We begin with a very useful result for the first order change in entanglement entropy\r
upon variation in the state.\r
Consider a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i of a general quantum system with\r
subsystem A. Then from the definition (17) of entanglement entropy, the first order\r
37

variation in the entanglement entropy for the subsystem A is given by28\r

dλρA\r
\u0013\r
− tr \u0012\r
d\r
dλρA\r
\u0013\r
(66)\r
Since the density matrix ρA for any state will have unit trace, the last term vanishes.\r
To simplify the expression further, we can define HA = − log ρA(λ = 0), usually known\r
as the MODULAR HAMILTONIAN associated with the unperturbed density matrix\r
ρA(λ = 0). With this definition, we can rewrite (66) as [54]\r
d\r
dλSA =\r
d\r
dλhHAi ≡ ddλ tr(HAρA) . (67)\r
We emphasize that the modular Hamiltonian HA is defined in terms of the unperturbed\r
density matrix and is not a function of λ; thus, the derivative on the right side acts\r
only on the state ρA.\r
The result (67) has become known as the FIRST LAW OF ENTANGLEMENT,\r
since it represents a quantum generalization of the first law of thermodynamics. To see\r
this, consider the special case where the unperturbed density matrix is thermal with\r
respect to some Hamiltonian H,\r

or more simply, dE = T dS. This is the usual first law of thermodynamics, though in\r
the form (69), we are allowed to apply it to any perturbation of the state, not just\r
perturbations to some nearby equilibrium state.\r
The entanglement first law (67) is most useful in cases where we have an explicit\r
expression for the modular Hamiltonian, as when the unperturbed density matrix is\r
thermal. For a conformal field theory on Minkowski space, a useful example is provided\r
by the case where the full state is the vacuum state and the subsystem is taken to be a\r
ball-shaped region. In this case, we can use our result (58),(60) for the density matrix\r
of the ball to rewrite (67) as [54]\r

this case, the statement is an inequality, that\r
∆hHAi − ∆SA ≥ 0 . (71)\r
28Here, we should be worried about operator ordering in our manipulations, but using the cyclicity\r
property of the trace, it follows that d/dλ tr(f(ρ)) = tr(f\r

information theoretic quantity, the RELATIVE ENTROPY of two states.\r
Relative entropy is a measure of distinguishibility between a (mixed) state ρ and a\r
reference state σ associated with the same Hilbert space. It is defined as\r
S(ρ||σ) = tr(ρ log ρ) − tr(ρ log σ) . (72)\r
Relative entropy vanishes if and only if ρ = σ, and is otherwise a positive quantity.\r
Further, if A ⊂ B are two subsystems of a general quantum system, it follows that\r
S(ρA||σA) ≤ S(ρB||σB) . (73)\r
Roughly, this says that having access to a larger subsystem allows us to more easily\r
distinguish two states of the full system.\r
In terms of the modular Hamiltonian Hσ = − log σ for the reference state, we can\r
rewrite (72) as\r
S(ρ||σ) = [tr(ρ(− log σ)) − tr(σ(− log σ))] − [tr(−σ log σ) − tr(−ρ log ρ)]\r
= ∆hHσi − ∆S (74)\r
where ∆ indicates the difference between the values for the state ρ and the reference\r
state σ. Using this expression, positivity of relative entropy immediately gives the\r
finite generalization (71) of the entanglement first law. Further, monotonicity implies\r
that the difference on the right side of (74) is non-decreasing as we move to a larger\r
system size.\r
For the case of a conformal field theory, we have an explicit expression for the\r
modular Hamiltonian when the reference state is taken to be the vacuum state and we\r
consider a ball-shaped region. In this case, we have the explicit constraints that\r

to any ball whose domain of dependence contains the original ball). These generalize\r
the first law constraint (70) to finite perturbations.\r
Quantum Fisher Information\r
For a given reference state σ, the positivity of relative entropy is equivalent to the\r
statement that S(ρ||σ) has a global minimum at ρ = σ on the space of density matrices\r
ρA. Thus, the first order variation away from ρ = σ must vanish, while the second\r
order variation must be positive. The first order statement is\r
δhHσi − δSA ≥ 0 = 0 , (76)\r
which is exactly the first law of entanglement that we derived directly above. At second\r
order, we have\r

tangent space to the manifold of states at σ via\r

(hδρ1 + δρ2, δρ1 + δρ2i − hδρ1, δρ1i − hδρ2, δρ2i) . (78)\r
By the positivity of relative entropy, the quantum Fisher information metric is non\u0002degenerate, non-negative and can be thought of as defining a Riemannian metric on\r
the space of states.\r
A minimal set of strong subadditivity constraints\r
We have previously mentioned the constraints of subadditivity (43)\r
S(A) + S(B) ≥ S(A ∪ B) (79)\r
and strong subadditivity\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C) ≥ S(B) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C); , (80)\r
where A, B, and C are disjoint subsystems of a quantum system. For a quantum\r
field theory on fixed spacetime B, we consider any Cauchy slice of B. Then the strong\r
subadditivity constraint must apply for the case where A, B, and C are any three\r
disjoint spatial regions of B.\r
In our discussions below, it will be useful to note [22, 55] that the full set of strong\r
subadditivity constraints is implied by a smaller set, where B is taken to be arbitrary\r
while A and C are taken to be infinitesimal. To see this, consider regions A, B, C1\r
and C2. Then the strong subadditivity constraints applied to triples {A, B, C1} and\r
{A, B ∪ C1 C2} give\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ C1) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1) + S(B)\r
S(A ∪ B ∪ C1) + S(B ∪ C1 ∪ C2) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ C1 ∪ C2) + S(B ∪ C1) .\r
Adding these, we find\r
S(A ∪ B) + S(B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2}) ≥ S(A ∪ B ∪ {C1 ∪ C2}) + S(B) .\r

{A, B, C2}, it applies for regions {A, B, C1 ∪ C2}. Given general regions {A, B, C},\r
we can then divide up A and C into infinitesimal parts Ai, and Ci. Starting from\r
the strong subadditivity constraint for {A1, B, C1}, we can then use the results above\r
to keep appending infinitesimal parts Ai and Ci, eventually building up to the full\r
constraint for {A, B, C} = {∪Ai, B, ∪Ci}.\r
Two dimensions\r
As an example, consider the strong subadditivity constraints in the case of a field\r
theory in 1+1 dimensions.\r
Let B be the interval [x1, x2] while A and C are the intervals [x1 + ǫξ1, x1] and\r
[x2, x2 + δξ2], as shown in figure 17. In this case, the constraint (45) gives\r
S([x1 + ǫξ1, x1] ∪ [x1, x2]) + S([x1, x2] ∪ [x2 + δξ2])\r
≥ S([x1 + ǫξ1, x1] ∪ [x1, x2] ∪ [x2 + δξ2]) + S([x1, x2])\r
=⇒ S(x1 + ǫξ1, x2) + S(x1, x2 + δξ2) − S(x1 + ǫξ1, x2 + δξ2) − S(x1, x2) ≥ 0\r

This second derivative of entanglement entropy has been dubbed the “entanglement\r
density” [22].\r
Since the constraint (81) is linear in the spacelike vectors ξ1 and ξ2, it is sufficient\r
to require that the constraint be satisfied in the lightlike limit of ξ1 and ξ2, i.e. when ξ1\r
and ξ2 lie along the dotted lines in figure 17. For example, the constraint for a general\r
spacelike ξ1 is obtained as a linear combination of the constraints for ξ1 in the future\r
and past lightlike directions.\r

where H vanishes in the limit λ → 0. We would like to understand what the first law\r
(70) tells us about the perturbation H.\r
First law for infinitesimal balls\r
It is useful to first consider the case where the ball-shaped region is an infinitesimal\r
ball around some point x0 [60]. In this case, the right-hand side of (70) depends only\r
on the expectation value of the energy density at the point x0. Using the HRT formula,\r
the left side will be determined by the area of the extremal bulk surface B˜ with the\r
same boundary as the infinitesimal ball. This surface is localized near the boundary of\r
AdS, so its area depends only on the asymptotic behaviour of the metric function H\r
in (85). A direct calculation shows that the first law translates to\r
dℓd−3\r
16πGN\r
d\r
dλH\r
i\r
i(x0, z = 0) = d\r
dλhT00(x0)i . (86)\r
Thus, the entanglement first law together with the HRT formula implies that the\r
asymptotic metric of M must be related to the CFT stress tensor expectation value.\r
This is a standard result in AdS/CFT, but we have seen that it follows directly from\r
the HRT formula.\r
We can obtain a more covariant version of (86) by noting that we have worked so\r
far with balls in the t = 0 slice, i.e. in the frame of reference of an observer with\r
four-velocity u\r
µ = (1,~0). In term of this vector, we have found that\r

But the same calculation goes through in any frame of reference, so the result (86)\r
must hold for any timelike u. This is possible if and only if\r

dλhTµνi =\r

For any conformal field theory, translation invariance and scaling symmetry imply that\r
the stress tensor expectation value must be conserved and traceless,\r
∂µhT\r

αi = 0 . (89)\r
From (87), the dual geometry must then satisfy the constraints that\r
∂µH\r
µν |z=0 = Hα\r
α|z=0 = 0 . (90)\r
These asymptotic constraints give our first restrictions on the geometry of a spacetime\r

The left hand side can be written more explicitly starting from the area functional (26).\r
To calculate the variation in area, we can use the fact that the original surface extrem\u0002izes the area functional for the original metric. Thinking of the area as a functional\r
Area(G, X) depending on both the spacetime metric G and the embedding function\r
X, we can write the first order variation schematically as\r
δArea = δArea\r
δG δG +\r
δArea\r
δX\r
δX\r
δG δG . (93)\r
However, the surface X being extremal means that the first variation of the area with\r
respect to variations in X vanishes, so only the first term here is nonzero, i.e. we need\r
only compute the variation of the action with respect to G while keeping the surface\r

Thus, the entanglement first law constraints for ball-shaped regions in slices of constant\r
t implies the time-time component of the linearized bulk Einstein equations. To obtain\r
the remaining components, we first repeat the argument for ball-shaped regions in\r
general frames of reference. Using precisely the same reasoning that we used leading\r
up to (87), we obtain\r
δEµν = 0 , (104)\r
where µ and ν correspond to the field theory directions. The remaining equations,\r
δEzν = δEzz = 0 (105)\r
are constraint equations. They hold everywhere if they hold at z = 0, and it turns out\r
that at z = 0 they are precisely equivalent to the asymptotic constraints (90) that we\r
obtained by considering small balls.\r
We have therefore shown that the first law of entanglement for ball-shaped regions\r
in the CFTs is precisely equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations in the gravity\r
dual theory [61, 60].\r
Connection to black hole thermodynamics\r
The equivalence of the entanglement first law with the linearized Einstein’s equations\r
is closely related to the the first law of black hole thermodynamics that served as\r
46

one of the initial motivations for the connection between entropy and geometry. As\r
we described above, a Rindler wedge of pure AdS is equivalent to a Schwarzschild\u0002AdS black hole with non-compact hyperbolic horizon geometry, at a special value\r
of the temperature. While this spacetime bears little resemblance to our standard\r
notion of a black hole, it turns out that a general form of the first law of black hole\r
thermodynamics applies to this spacetime. The result, proved by Wald and Iyer [62] (we\r
review this below), says that for any perturbation satisfying the Einstein’s equations\r
linearized about this background (and more generally, any black hole background with\r
a “bifurcate Killing horizon”), the change in area of the horizon is equal to the change in\r
a certain energy defined based on the asymptotic metric. It turns out that this energy\r
is exactly the quantity δEgrav\r
B\r
coming in on the right hand side of (96). Thus, the black\r
hole first law is equivalent to the assertion that the linearized Einstein equation implies\r
the gravitational version of the entanglement first law. The result that the linearized\r
Einstein equation follows from the first law (applied to all boundary balls in all Lorentz\r
frames) thus provides a converse to the theorem of Wald and Iyer.\r
Generalizations\r
There are various generalizations of these first-order results. First, in higher-derivative\r
theories of gravity, it is known that the correct gravitational expressions for black hole\r
entropy (defined so that the laws of black hole thermodynamics work out correctly)\r
involve more general covariant functionals rather than area. It is possible to show that\r
starting with these more general functionals the entanglement first law implies the lin\u0002earized gravitational equations corresponding to the associated higher-derivative La\u0002grangian [60]. In this derivation, possible terms in the entanglement entropy functional\r
involving extrinsic curvatures do not contribute.\r
We can also take into account the leading quantum effects in the gravitational the\u0002ory by including the quantum corrections (24) in the HRT formula. For a ball-shaped\r
region, the bulk entanglement term measures the entanglement of perturbative bulk\r
fields inside the associated Rindler wedge with fields outside the wedge. This entangle\u0002ment can be related directly to the expectation value of the bulk stress-energy tensor\r
via a bulk version of the entanglement first law (67). For this calculation, we require\r
the modular Hamiltonian for a Rindler wedge of AdS, for general quantum field theory\r
in its vacuum state. Fortunately, essentially the same path integral calculation (from\r
appendix C) that gives the density matrix for a Rindler wedge of Minkowski space also\r
works in AdS, yielding an expression analogous to (54) for the modular Hamiltonian.\r
Using that expression in the first law, we find that the extra bulk entanglement term in\r
the entanglement first law results in a source term for the linearized Einstein equations\r
[63]\r
δEab = 8πGN hTabi . (106)\r
In this derivation, the universality of gravity, that all fields act as sources for gravita\u0002tion, arises from the universality of entanglement, that all fields contribute to the bulk\r
47

spatial entanglement entropy.30\r
What is the form χ?\r
For a deeper understanding of the relation between the entanglement first law and\r
the linearized Einstein equations, and to understand the meaning of the form χ that\r
played a crucial role in the derivation, it is helpful to review some formalism originally\r
introduced by Wald and collaborators (see e.g. [62, 64]). This formalism is also the\r
basis for the generalization to arbitrary covariant theories of gravity. This section is\r
not essential for understanding the remaining sections, so the reader should not worry\r
about fully absorbing the content here before continuing.\r
Consider a general classical theory of gravity with covariant Lagrangian L(g), where\r
g represents the metric as well as any matter fields. For this theory, the action can be\r
written as the integral over spacetime of a differential form\r
L = Lǫ (107)\r
where\r
ǫ =\r
√\r
gǫa1···ad+1dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxad+1. (108)\r
When we vary the action to determine the equations of motion for the theory, the usual\r
procedure is to make the variation and reorganize the result (via integration by parts)\r
as a total derivative plus a term proportional to the variation δg without derivatives on\r
δg. Requiring that this variation vanishes for any δg means that the term multiplying\r
δg must vanish. In terms of the differential form L, this means that we can write its\r
variation under a variation of the metric as\r
δL = E · δg + dθ (109)\r
where E represent quantities defined such that E = 0 are the equations of motion, and\r
· represents the various index contractions for the different fields (e.g. Eabδgab for the\r
term proportional to the metric variation). The term dθ is the exterior derivative of\r
a d-form θ; this is the total derivative term that we separate off when integrating by\r
parts.\r
The quantity θ plays an important role in the phase space formulation of our grav\u0002itational theory. We recall that in general classical mechanics systems, dynamics can\r
be understood as evolution in phase space governed by Hamilton’s equations X˙ = ξH\r
where ξH is a vector field on phase space defined in terms of a symplectic two-form W\r
and a Hamiltonian function H by\r
ξH · W = dH . (110)\r
30Various authors have argued that the linearized gravitational equations plus the assumption that\r
the stress-energy tensor acts as a source for these equations requires that the complete theory is a\r
generally-covariant theory of gravity. With the additional assumption that the black hole entropy\r
functional is simply area (which follows from our assumption of HRT), the theory is further restricted\r
to Einstein gravity coupled to matter. Thus, we have at least an indirect argument for the full\r
non-linear gravitational equations starting from entanglement physics.\r
48

For our gravitational system, the symplectic form acts on a pair (δg1δg2) of deforma\u0002tions to the metric, and is given by\r
W(g, δg1, δg2) = Z\r
Σ\r
ω(g, δg1, δg2) (111)\r
where ω is defined in terms of θ as\r
ω(g, δg1, δg2) = δ1θ(g, δg2) − δ2θ(g, δg1) . (112)\r
Now, consider the metric transformation g → g + LXg induced by a vector field X,\r
where (LX g)ab = ∇aXb + ∇bXa is the Lie derivative. This induces a flow on the\r
gravitational phase space. Using the definition (110), we can associate a phase space\r
Hamiltonian HX to this flow if for any other perturbation δg (viewed as second vector\r
field on phase space to which the one forms on the left and right side of (110) are\r
applied) we have\r
δHX = W(δg,LXg). (113)\r
As we will see below, certain very useful notions of energy in general relativity can be\r
defined in this way as the phase space Hamiltonian corresponding to specific vector\r
fields.\r
The form θ also appears in the definition of conserved quantities associated with\r
symmetries of the gravitational theory. Since the theory is diffeomorphism invariant,\r
the coordinate transformation δx = X for any vector field X represents a symmetry\r
of the theory. By the usual Noether procedure, we can find an associated conserved\r
current, which turns out to be\r
JX = θ(δX g) − X · L . (114)\r
This has been written as a differential form, so that the equation of current conservation\r
is simply\r
dJX = 0 . (115)\r
Because this holds for all vector fields X, it follows [62], that we can find a (d−1)-form\r
Q such that\r
JX = dQX + X\r
aCa (116)\r
where Ca are quantities proportional to the equation of motion that vanish on shell.\r
In terms of these definitions, the form χ used in the previous section is defined in\r
terms of X and an arbitrary variation of the fields as:\r
χ(g, δg) = δQX(g) − X · θ(δg) (117)\r
The key property of χ is that it obeys an identity\r
dχ = ω(g, δg,LXg) − X · (Eδg) − X\r
a\r
δCa . (118)\r
49

In the case where the background metric g satisfies the equations of motion E = 0 and\r
admits a Killing vector X = ξ so that Lξg = 0, this simplifies to\r
dχ = −ξ\r
a\r
δCa . (119)\r
Recalling that Ca vanishes when the equations of motion are satisfied, we have that\r
δCa is a quantity that vanishes when the variation δg satisfies the equations of motion\r
linearized about the background g.\r
This result leads directly to Iyer and Wald’s derivation of the first law of black hole\r
mechanics. In this case, we consider a black hole with a Killing horizon (i.e. a horizon\r
where some Killing vector in the black hole exterior vanishes), and take ξ to be the\r
Killing vector vanishing at the horizon. Then for any on-shell variation of the metric,\r
we have dχ = 0. Integrating this from the spacetime boundary B to the horizon B˜,\r
we get R\r
B\r
χ =\r
R\r
B˜ δQξ. For Einstein gravity coupled to matter, it turns out that the\r
expression on the right is proportional to the variation in the area of the black hole\r
horizon, while the expression on the left has the interpretation of energy, and we get\r
the first law dE = T dS once we identify S = Area/4G. For more general theories\r
of gravity, everything still works, but Qξ is no longer the area. So we have this more\r
general quantity (usually called the Wald entropy functional) that describes the black\r
hole entropy.\r
For our application to the previous section, we take g to be pure AdS, and ξ to be\r
a Killing vector (described below around equation (117)) that vanishes at the extremal\r
surface B˜. Then (119) is exactly the condition (100) that we needed above. As in\r
Wald’s derivation, the integral of χ over B˜ is the variation in the area of B˜ under\r
the metric perturbation, while the integral of χ over the boundary region B has an\r
interpretation as a variation in energy. These turn out to be exactly the conditions\r
(98) and (99) that we needed above."""

For ball-shaped regions in a holographic CFT, the expression for relative entropy (75)\r
can be translated directly to a gravitational quantity using the HRT formula and the\r
result (91) for the gravitational interpretation of the stress tensor expectation value.\r
The resulting quantity, which we denote as ∆Egrav − ∆S\r
grav, must be positive and\r
monotonic with increasing system size.31 We will now see that this quantity has the\r
interpretation as an energy associated to a bulk region that lies between the boundary\r
domain of dependence region DB and the extremal surface B˜.\r
Positivity of Fisher Information\r
We start by considering the interpretation of relative entropy for states that are small\r
perturbations to the vacuum. We recall that the leading contributions to relative\r
entropy come at second order and define the Fisher information (77).\r
31The application of relative entropy in holography was initiated in [54].\r

conformal Killing vector ζ. Dashed red paths indicate the action of the Killing vector\r
ξ.\r
On the gravity side, the positivity of Fisher information implies the positivity of\r
a certain perturbative gravitational energy [65]. To define this, consider the Rindler\r
wedge of the unperturbed AdS spacetime associated with the boundary ball B. Asso\u0002ciated to this is a bulk Killing vector ξB that vanishes on the Rindler horizon (i.e. the\r
extremal surface B˜ in the unperturbed spacetime) and asymptotes to the boundary\r
conformal Killing vector (59) near the AdS boundary, as shown in figure 19. Explicitly,\r
in the Rindler wedge associated with a ball of radius R situated at the origin on the\r
boundary Minkowski space, the Killing vector takes the form\r

2 = R2 and reduces to\r
(59) in the region DB at the boundary of AdS. For the quantum field theory describing\r
perturbative bulk fields on the pure AdS background, this timelike Killing vector defines\r
to a symmetry, so there is an associated conserved energy, which includes contributions\r

perturbation that acts as a source for the second order metric perturbation in the\r
perturbative Einstein equations.32 This quantity is known as the canonical energy\r
associated with the Killing vector ξB. Thus, Fisher information in the CFT is dual\r
to canonical energy on the gravity side, and the relative entropy inequalities imply\r
that this energy must be positive for the Rindler wedges associated with all possible\r
boundary balls and must increase as we increase the size of the ball.\r
Relative entropy constraints for general asymptotically AdS geometries\r
The fact that relative entropy corresponds to a natural gravitational energy at second\r
order in perturbations to pure AdS suggests that this quantity might be related to some\r
notion of energy more generally. This is very interesting, as it is a notoriously difficult\r
problem to come up with precise covariantly defined notions of energy for gravitational\r
subsystems.\r
For a general asymptotically AdS spacetime, there will be no Killing vectors, and\r
no preferred definition of time apart from the boundary time used to define the ADM\r
mass of the whole spacetime. It is therefore unclear a priori how to define useful\r
notions of energy for subsystems. However, the following definition turns out to be\r
the precise dual of relative entropy associated with a ball-shaped region B [66]. In\r
place of the Killing vector (120) defined for a Rindler wedge of AdS, we define a vector\r
ξ in the entanglement wedge associated with B that has the same behavior as the\r
Rindler wedge Killing vector near the extremal surface and near the AdS boundary.\r
Specifically, we demand that ξ reduces to the conformal Killing vector ζB at the AdS\r
boundary region DB, that ξ vanishes at the extremal surface B˜, and that the Killing\r
equation (Lξg)ab = ∇(aξb) = 0 is satisfied at the boundary (up to some order in z)\r
and at the extremal surface. We also require that the antisymmetrized derivative at\r
the extremal surface has the same behavior as for the Rindler wedge Killing vector.\r
It is always possible to satisfy these conditions, and in fact there is a great deal of\r
freedom in choosing ξ since it is essentially unconstrained away from the boundaries\r
of the entanglement wedge.\r
Though our general asymptotically AdS spacetime M has no Killing vectors, the\r
vector ξ generates a diffeomorphism, and this is a symmetry of the gravitational theory.\r
32To derive this result, we can use the results (98) and (99) that δSgrav and δEgrav are related to\r
the integral of the form χ over B˜ and B respectively. Assuming the background and perturbations\r
satisfy the equations of motion, we can then use the identity (118) to obtain\r

The expression on the right is defined by Hollands and Wald [64] to be the canonical energy associated\r
with ξ, and shown to be equivalent to (121).\r
52

Thus, we can define an associated symmetry current (the quantity Jξ defined in (116))\r
and integrate over a spatial slice of the entanglement wedge to define the corresponding\r
charge EB. Remarkably, this charge is independent of the choice of ξ, and it is exactly\r
the quantity dual to relative entropy. Thus, if the spacetime M does correspond to\r
some consistent CFT state, the energy EB associated with the entanglement wedge\r
of B must be positive for every choice of B and be larger for a larger ball B′ with\r
DB ⊂ DB′.\r
This result can be understood as a prediction for a new positive energy theorem\r
in general relativity. We have derived it making use of basic quantum mechanical\r
constraints in the underlying CFT description for the theory. However, it is plausible\r
that assuming some standard energy condition in GR would be sufficient to derive the\r
result directly as a theorem in classical general relativity.\r
Example: spherically symmetric geometries\r
As a simple example, we can consider the constraints on regular spherically-symmetric\r
asymptotically AdS geometries in four dimensional gravity, for example, the geometry\r
associated with a spherically symmetric distribution of matter obeying some equation\r
of state. If this solution represents a consistent state in a UV-complete theory of\r
gravity, it should correspond to a homogeneous state of some CFT on a sphere. For\r
this state, the relative entropy to the vacuum state for any ball-shaped region must\r
be positive. Taking the region to be a hemisphere, and using the expression (170) for\r
the modular Hamiltonian of a ball in the vacuum state on a sphere, the positivity of\r
relative entropy (71) yields [55]\r
∆A ≤ 2πGNMℓ . (124)\r
where the left side represents the area of the surface bisecting the spherically-symmetric\r
space relative to this area in pure AdS,33 and M is the mass of the spacetime. The\r
right side is obtained from the modular Hamiltonian expectation value using the fact\r
that for a translation-invariant stress-tensor on the sphere (which we assume to be of\r
unit radius), we have\r
∆hT00i =\r
ECF T\r
4π\r

Mℓ\r

The result (124) tells us that there is a limit to how much a certain mass can deform\r
the spacetime from pure AdS. This should restrict the equation of state that matter in\r
a consistent theory of gravity can have. It would be interesting to understand whether\r
this constraint also follows from one of the more standard energy conditions typically\r
assumed in general relativity."""

In the previous section, we considered constraints on spacetimes dual to states of\r
holographic conformal field theories. We assumed that for these states (which we will\r
call holographic), the entanglement entropies of spatial regions are all encoded in a\r
single geometry M via the holographic entanglement entropy formula. This represents\r
a very special structure of entanglement: the space of possible entanglement entropies\r
(functions on a space of subsets of the AdS boundary) is much larger than the space\r
of possible asymptotically AdS metrics (functions of a few spacetime coordinates), so\r
only a tiny fraction of all quantum field theory states should be geometric in this way.\r
For a general conformal field theory, there is no reason to expect any of the states\r

field theories, not all states will have this property: taking a quantum superposition of\r
a small number of states corresponding to different classical geometries, the resulting\r
state will correspond to a quantum superposition of geometries rather than a single\r

title = "A necessary condition for CFTs with Einstein gravity duals from entangle\u0002ment"
text = """
For the vacuum state of any conformal field theory, the vacuum entanglement entropies\r
for ball-shaped regions are given by a universal formula (e.g. equation (32) for the\r
two-dimensional case) that matches with the areas of extremal surfaces in pure Anti\r
de Sitter spacetime. However, taking any more general region A, the CFT vacuum\r
entanglement entropy for this region would not be expected to match with the gravity\r
result for the area of the extremal surface A˜ in AdS. Requiring this agreement gives\r
a necessary condition for a CFT to have a holographic dual whose classical limit is\r
Einstein gravity coupled to matter (i.e. for which the entanglement functional is simply\r
area). Since this condition must hold for all possible regions A˜, it should be quite\r
constraining; perhaps it is even a sufficient condition for a CFT to have an Einstein\r
gravity dual.\r
One way to investigate this constraint in more detail is to start with the case of a\r
ball-shaped region and work perturbatively in deformations to the shape of the region.\r
For recent calculations along these lines, see [25].\r
Entanglement entropy from one-point functions in holographic states\r
Now consider a theory which has a holographic dual theory with some particular bulk\r
equations of motion in the classical limit. Any classical spacetime MΨ dual to a holo\u0002graphic state |Ψi must be a solution to the bulk equations of motion. We can think of\r
the bulk equations as determining a solution everywhere starting from some initial data\r
on a Cauchy surface. In AdS, it is convenient to think instead of the bulk solution as\r
being determined by evolution in the holographic radial direction, with “initial data”\r
specified at the timelike boundary of AdS.34 Thus, for geometries dual to holographic\r
states, we can say that the bulk spacetime (at least in a perturbative sense) is encoded\r
in the boundary behavior of the various fields.\r
The boundary behavior of the light bulk fields is determined according to AdS/CFT\r
by the one-point functions of some associated low-dimension local operators in the CFT.\r
For example, we have seen that the boundary behavior of the metric is determined\r
by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor as in (91). Once we have the\r
bulk spacetime solution, we can use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate many\r
other non-local quantities in the CFT such as correlation functions and entanglement\r
entropies. Thus, the assumption that a state is holographic allows us (via gravity\r
calculations) to determine the entanglement entropies and other non-local properties\r
of the state from the local data provided by the one-point functions:\r
|Ψi → hOα(x\r
µ\r
)i → φα asymptotics → φα(x\r
µ\r
, z) → entanglement entropies S(A)\r
(127)\r
where φ here indicates all light fields including the metric.\r
34Here, the existence and uniqueness of solutions is less clear, but we can at least construct solutions\r
perturbatively away from the boundary.\r
55

Figure 20: The interior region I in a slice of AdS is contained in the entanglement\r
wedge for any CFT subsystem larger than A¯, but no CFT subsystem smaller than A.\r
The recipe (127) could be applied to any state, but for states that are not holo\u0002graphic, the results will be inconsistent with the actual CFT answers. For example,\r
using this recipe, the vacuum one-point functions for any CFT will give us pure AdS\r
spacetime, and we have seen in the previous subsection that entanglement entropies for\r
more general regions will generally not match with those calculated by the holographic\r
formula from this spacetime.\r
Thus, we have a stringent (in-principle) test for whether a CFT state has a dual\r
description well-described by a classical spacetime: carry out the procedure in (127)\r
and compare the results with a direct CFT calculation of the entanglement entropies;\r
if there is a mismatch for any region, the state is not holographic.\r
Quantum error correction\r
An interesting feature of holographic states is that they share some features with states\r
referred to by quantum information theorists as “quantum error-correcting codes” [67].\r
The basic feature of these states is that they encode some specific information non\u0002locally, in such a way that the information can be recovered if we have access to any\r
sufficiently large subsystem. Thus, even if a (sufficiently small) part of the our system\r
is corrupted somehow, we can still recover the encoded information by looking at a\r
complementary subsystem.\r
To understand the connection with the AdS/CFT correspondence, recall that the\r
density matrix ρA for a spatial subsystem A of the CFT encodes information about\r
the entanglement wedge (call this WA) in the bulk, as we discussed in section 4. Now,\r
consider some ball I in the interior of AdS, as shown in figure 20. According to the\r
duality between density matrices and bulk entanglement wedges, we can say that\r
• The information about I is contained in the density matrix for any region larger\r
than A¯, since the region I will be contained in the corresponding entanglement\r
56

wedge.\r
• The information about I is not contained in the density matrix for any region\r
smaller than A, since none of the corresponding entanglement wedges intersect\r
I\r
Thus, we have a behavior similar to a quantum error-correcting code; the information\r
about the central region is “protected” from corruption of small subsystems. The latter\r
property shows that this protection is not achieved by simply storing the information\r
many times in different spatial subsystems (as in classical error-correction), but rather\r
by distributing it nonlocally throughout the system.\r
An interesting consequence of this picture is that for a bulk observable localized\r
in the region I, there cannot just be a single CFT operator corresponding to this\r
observable, since no nontrivial CFT operators are common to all subsystems larger than\r
A¯ (alternatively, there are no operators that commute with all operators in subsystems\r
smaller than A). Instead, there must be a family of CFT operators corresponding to\r
this observable, such that each CFT subsystem larger than A¯ contains one of these\r
operators. Since the operators in this family are different, they cannot have the same\r
expectation values for all states of the CFT, but it is possible that they agree on some\r
subset (or subspace) of the states for which we have nice classical dual geometry. In\r
the language of quantum error correction, this is the “code subspace.”\r
In summary, one of the special features of holographic states that distinguish them\r
from general CFT states is that they have features reminiscent of quantum error\u0002correcting codes. For a more detailed discussion, see [67, 68].\r
Entropy inequalities for holographic states\r
In the previous section, we have discussed constraints on entanglement entropies that\r
must hold in all multipartite quantum systems. We have seen that for holographic CFT\r
states, some of these constraints can be related to properties of the dual geometries. For\r
example, in static geometries, strong subadditivity inequalities can be shown to hold\r
automatically from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [29]. It turns out that by assuming the\r
existence of a dual geometry for which the Ryu-Takayanagi formula holds, it is possible\r
to prove additional constraints on entanglement entropies that are not generally true\r
in all quantum systems. As an example, it can be shown [69] that for any state dual\r
to a static asymptotically AdS geometry, we have\r
S(A ∪ B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ B) − S(B ∪ C) − S(A ∪ C) + S(A) + S(B) + S(C) ≤ 0 , (128)\r
known as the negativity of tripartite information. Unlike subadditivity and strong sub\u0002additivity, this inequality is not generally true in quantum systems. Thus, it represents\r
a necessary condition for a CFT state to be holographic (at least in the state case). A\r
more general family of such constraints has been discussed in [70].\r

There are many interesting topics that I have not been able to mention here, due to\r
limitations of time and my own expertise; this is certainly not meant to be a com\u0002prehensive review of the subject. The reader is encouraged to look at some of the\r
references, and also to see which recent papers cite some of the key references in order\r
to get a sense of what is going on currently. Also recommended are various online\r
lectures, for example those from the “It From Qubit” summer school at Perimeter In\u0002stitute, and from various recent conferences on gravity and entanglement at KITP and\r
the Perimeter Institute. To conclude, I will briefly mention of a few more interesting\r
topics that may be useful to be aware of.\r
Dynamics of entanglement\r
It is interesting to understand how entanglement evolves in time-dependent states. For\r
example, we can consider either a “global quench” in which the Hamiltonian of a sys\u0002tem suddenly undergoes a translation-invariant perturbation, or a “local quench” for\r
which the perturbation is localized to some finite region. In either case, the state of\r
the system will evolve with time after the quench, and we can ask about the time\u0002dependence of the entanglement entropy for regions of a certain size (and, in the case\r
of the local quench, location). Many authors have considered this problem in quantum\r
field theories and in holography; understanding the behavior in holographic theories\r
implied by gravitational physics gives us further constraints on the properties of holo\u0002graphic CFTs and holographic states. For some recent work on this subject, including\r
interesting connections to quantum chaos, see for example [71, 72, 73, 74] and references\r
therein.\r
Kinematic space\r
In section 5.2, we saw that the linearized Einstein equations in the bulk could be un\u0002derstood in the CFT language as saying that the entanglement first law is satisfied for\r
all ball-shaped regions in all Lorentz frames. This space of regions, or alternatively\r
the space of domain of dependence regions DB for all balls B, has been called “kine\u0002matic space”; in recent work [75, 76, 77], there have been hints that various aspects of\r
CFT physics and of AdS/CFT might be understood naturally using the language of\r
kinematic space.\r
We can define a natural set of coordinates on kinematic space by noting that the\r
domain of dependence DB of each ball-shaped region is bounded by the future light\r
cone of some point x0 and the past lightcone of some point x1 in the future of x0.\r
Thus, we can associate points in kinematic space with pairs of points X = (x0, x1) on\r
the original spacetime with x1 in the future of x0; this is some 2d-dimensional space.\r
There is a conformally-invariant signature (d, d) metric on this space [76, 77], and also\r
a natural partial ordering: we say X1 < X2 if DX1 ⊂ DX2.\r
All regions DX are conformally equivalent. We can define a mapping from each\r
DX to some standard region D0 (e.g. the domain of dependence of a unit sphere\r
58

in Minkowski space, or hyperbolic space times time). Then, given any state |Ψi of\r
the CFT, the density matrix ρDX maps to some density matrix ρ0 for our standard\r
region D0. Thus, for every state of the CFT, we can associate a function ρ0(X)\r
from kinematic space to the space of density matrices for the CFT on D0. Starting\r
from this construction, we can we define other natural functions on kinematic space,\r
for example, the vacuum subtracted entanglement entropy ∆S(X). For states close\r
to the vacuum, this has been shown to satisfy some simple differential equation on\r
kinematic space [76, 77]. We can also consider the relative entropy to some reference\r
state, R(X)|Ψ0i. Monotonicity of relative entropy implies that any such function\r
obeys R(X)|Ψ0i > R(Y )|Ψ0i for X > Y ; i.e. these relative entropy functions are\r
all monotonic on kinematic space with respect to the natural partial ordering.\r
It will be interesting to see whether additional new insights about CFTs and holog\u0002raphy will be gained by thinking about these kinematic space structures.\r
Tensor Networks\r
Holographic CFTs are strongly coupled theories with a large number of degrees of\r
freedom. Thus, it is difficult to understand their quantum states directly; most of\r
what we know about these states is based on calculations in the dual gravitational\r
theory. It is interesting to ask whether we can find examples of states in simpler\r
quantum systems which share qualitative features with the holographic CFT states.\r
At the very least, constructing such states is a useful way of demonstrating that certain\r
features deduced from the gravity side (e.g. a particular structure of entanglement)\r
are even possible in a consistent quantum system.\r
Recently, starting with the work of Swingle [40], it has been understood that certain\r
states associated with “tensor networks” share many features with states of holographic\r
CFTs; thus studying the physics in the tensor network states may give us new insights\r
into holography.\r
To define tensor network states, consider a quantum system with Hilbert space\r
H = Hd ⊗ Hd ⊗ Hd · · · ⊗ Hd (129)\r
where we typically imagine that the dimension-d tensor product factors correspond\r
to subsystems arranged spatially, as in a spin chain. Given a set of basis elements\r
|i1i ⊗ |i2i ⊗ · · · , a general state of the system can be written as\r
|Ψi =\r
X\r
i\r
ψi1i2...iN\r
|i1i ⊗ |i2i ⊗ · · · |iN i . (130)\r
Thus, any state of the system corresponds to some tensor ψi1i2...iN.\r
One is often interested in finding the ground state of a system for some particular\r
choice of Hamiltonian, e.g. a local Hamilton that includes interactions between tensor\r
product factors corresponding to nearby subsystems. It turns out that in many such\r
cases, we can come up with a very good approximation to the ground state by building\r
59

the tensor ψi1i2...iN\r
out of simpler tensors. For example, consider a general three-index\r
tensor MiA\r
B, which could be used to describe a map\r
M : HD → HD ⊗ Hd (131)\r
as\r
M =\r
X\r
i,A,B\r
MiA\r
B\r
|ii ⊗ |AihB| . (132)\r
From this tensor M, we can define a state of our original system (known as a matrix\r
product state) as\r
ψi1i2...iN =\r
X\r
Ai\r
Mi1A1\r
A2Mi2A2A3\r
· · ·MiN AN\r
A1\r
. (133)\r
This construction can be represented diagrammatically as in figure 21a.35. The ex\u0002pression (133) can be thought of as a variational ansatz used to approximate the true\r
ground state. If the dimension D of the auxiliary space is not too large, the number of\r
parameters defining the state (133) is far smaller than the number of parameters defin\u0002ing a general state of the system, so solving the variational problem is computationally\r
much less demanding that finding the exact ground state. For systems with long-range\r
correlations (e.g. those which approximate continuum conformal field theories), simple\r
tensor network states (133) generally do not provide a good approximation to the true\r
ground state but we can consider states associated with more complicated networks\r
such as the one shown in figure 21b. One might hope that certain tensor network states\r
of this type, which provide good approximations to CFT ground states, could provide\r
a useful toy model for holographic states. Specifically, we might hope that such states\r
have a structure of entanglement similar to that in holographic theories, as suggested\r
originally by [40].\r
In recent work [68, 78], tensor network states have been constructed for which\r
the entanglement structure is “geometric” just as in holographic theories. These\r
states obey a Ryu-Takayanagi formula where the entropy of a subsystem A is well\u0002approximated by the “area” of a minimal surface in the network, defined to be the\r
minimal number of network links that need to be cut in order to isolate A from the\r
rest of the system. This is illustrated in figure 21b. In particular, [78] has shown that\r
this feature is generically true if the dimensions associated to legs in the network are\r
large and the tensors are chosen randomly. Thus, if we choose a network for which the\r
graph minimal “areas” behave in the same way as the minimal surface areas in AdS or\r
some other geometry (e.g. by choosing the graph to be a discretization of the given ge\u0002ometry), we obtain states whose entanglement structure is very similar to holographic\r
CFT states. In the models of ([68]), the network states have also been shown to have\r
35To be more precise, we could draw arrows on the edges of the graph such that an outgoing arrow\r
represents a lower index and an incoming arrow represents an upper index. Alternatively, we can\r
take all the vertices to represent tensors with lower indices (i.e. states) and edges to represent index\r
contractions with some choice of tensor Mij , giving T\r
1\r
···i···MijT\r
2\r

choice for Mij ; we can take Mij = δ\r

this subsystem from the rest of the network. We can think of this as the “area” of the\r

The resulting spacetime has signature (d, 1) but has closed timelike curves correspond\u0002ing to orbits of the rotation symmetry in the (X−1, X0) plane. We can consider instead\r
the universal cover of this space, obtained by letting the angular coordinate associated\r
with this symmetry have a range (−∞, ∞) instead of [0, 2π). The resulting spacetime\r
is pure global Anti-de-Sitter spacetime, or “global AdS”, a homogeneous and isotropic\r
Lorentzian spacetime. For certain calculations, it is useful to work directly with these\r
embedding space coordinates, taking into account the constraint (134).\r

homogeneous and isotropic space with negative curvature. Note that the metric of\r
AdS is not simply hyperbolic space times time, but rather a “warped product,” in\r
which the time dilation factor relating coordinate time to proper time varies with\r
space.\r
Starting from any point in AdS, there is an infinite proper distance to ρ = ∞.\r
However, a light signal can reach ρ = ∞ and return in finite proper time. Thus, there\r
is a sense in which Anti de Sitter space has a boundary at ρ = ∞ that can be probed\r
by light signals. To highlight this causal structure, it is useful to define yet another set\r

light-ray trajectories, the geometry is that of a Euclidean ball times time. Trajectories\r
of light rays are the same in this space as in AdS, so this description is very useful\r
in understanding the causal structure. For this reason, AdS is often depicted as a\r

The overall factor in front of the metric (139) diverges at the boundary, so while\r
the boundary has a well-defined causal structure, it does not a priori have a particular\r
geometry associated with it. However, sometimes it is convenient to make a choice of\r
boundary geometry consistent with this causal structure. In practice, a simple way to\r

a particular geometry induced by the metric in AdS. If we rescale the metric for these\r
surfaces by z\r

in the limit z → 0, we obtain a well-defined geometry in the limit,\r
described by the metric Γ0\r
µν (x). We will refer to this as the boundary geometry. We\r

class of geometries with the same causal structure. Such geometries are related by a\r
conformal transformation (i.e. an overall spacetime-dependent rescaling of the metric).\r
No experiment in AdS can be performed to determine which geometry in this class is\r

This is a convenient representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a\r

These coordinates cover only a portion of AdS, the shaded region in figure 22 known\r
as the “Poincar´e patch”. The coordinates in (143) are related to the global AdS\r
coordinates in (136) by\r

i = 1. This is a\r
very useful representation for the dual spacetime for the vacuum state of a holographic\r
conformal field theory defined on Minkowski spacetime.\r
Asymptotically locally AdS geometries\r
In the AdS/CFT correspondence, general holographic states of a CFT on a bound\u0002ary spacetime B correspond to spacetimes which are asymptotically locally AdS, with\r
boundary geometry B. These may generally be represented in Fefferman-Graham co\u0002ordinates (140), where Γ(z = 0) is taken to be the metric of B. Spacetimes associated\r
with different states are associated with different behavior for Γ away from z = 0.\r
Some important examples are the black hole geometries in AdSd+1, corresponding to\r
the CFT in a thermal state. For global AdS, the corresponding black hole is spherically\r
symmetric and can be described by\r
ds2 = −fS(r)dt2 +\r

These can also be described in Fefferman-Graham coordinates; for example the metric\r

rewritten as\r

This solution (for the special case of 2+1 dimensions) is locally the same as pure AdS\r
(as are all solutions to Einstein’s equations in three dimensions without matter). By\r
a coordinate transformation, this geometry can be mapped onto the region in the\r
geometry (143) which is the intersection of the causal past and the causal future of\r
a diamond-shaped region which is the domain of dependence of the interval {x ∈\r
[−1, 1], t = 0} on the boundary.\r
B Conformal transformations on density matrices\r
In this appendix, we briefly review a few relevant facts about conformal symmetries in\r
field theory. We say that two spacetimes M and M˜ with metrics g(x), g˜(˜x) are related\r
by a conformal transformation if there is a map\r
x\r
µ → x˜µ = fµ\r
(x) (151)\r
between points of the two spacetimes such that the metrics are related as\r
gµν(˜x)dx˜\r
µ\r
dx˜\r
ν = Ω2\r
(x)gµν(x)dxµdxν(152)\r
where the overall spacetime-dependent scaling Ω(x) is known as the conformal factor.\r
Conformal field theories on two spacetimes related by such a conformal transformation\r
are equivalent, and there is a one-to-one mapping between the states of the two theories\r
that we can write as\r
ρM = UΩρM˜ U\r
†\r
Ω\r
. (153)\r
In the special case where the two spacetimes are equivalent to one another (e.g.\r
where they are both Rd,1 and the transformation represents a translation, boost, scal\u0002ing, inversion or some combination of these), this transformation defines a map on the\r
space of states of a single theory. The vacuum state of a CFT on Rd,1or S\r
d × R is\r
invariant under these transformations, which represent the spacetime symmetries of\r
the CFT."""

There are several specific examples of conformal transformation that will be useful to\r
us in the context of AdS/CFT. First, we can show that Minkowski space is conformally\r
equivalent to a part of S\r
d × R, namely the domain of dependence of a sphere minus\r
a single point p, as shown in figure 12.36 Through this transformation, any state of\r
the CFT on the sphere can be associated with a Minkowski space CFT state for each\r
such domain of dependence region. The vacuum state of the sphere CFT maps to the\r
vacuum state of the CFT on Minkowski space.\r
Through this transformation, the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region on\r
the sphere maps to the domain of dependence of a ball-shaped region of Minkowski\r
space. By a further conformal transformation mapping Minkowski space to itself, this\r
domain of dependence region can be mapped to the domain of dependence of a half\r
space (for example x\r
1 > 0). This region is also conformally equivalent to the static\r
spacetime Hd ×R, where Hdis hyperbolic space, the non-compact Euclidean manifold\r
of constant negative curvature.\r
C Path integral representation of states and den\u0002sity matrices in quantum field theory\r
Path integrals are a familiar tool in quantum field theory to represent various useful\r
quantities such as the partition function or the generating functional for correlation\r
functions. They can also be used to represent various states and density matrices.\r
We begin with the basic result that transition amplitudes can be expressed as a path\r
integral as\r
hφ1(t1)|e\r
−iHt|φ0(t0)i = N\r
Z φ(t1)=φ1\r
φ(t0)=φ0\r
[dφ]e\r
iS(φ(t))\r
, (154)\r
where N is a normalization factor. The derivation, found in most field theory text\u0002books, involves splitting the time evolution operator into a product of infinitesimal\r
pieces and inserting between each factor the identity operator, expressed as a sum over\r
the projection operators associated with a complete basis of states.\r
Taking t = −iβ, we obtain the corresponding Euclidean statement\r
hφ1|e\r
−βH|φ0i = N\r
Z φ(β)=φ1\r
φ(0)=φ0\r
[dφ]e\r
−SEuc(φ(τ))\r
, (155)\r
where SEuc is the action analytically continued to Euclidean space. Up to a normaliza\u0002tion factor, these are the matrix elements of the density matrix for the thermal state\r
e\r
−βH/Z, i.e. the canonical ensemble. This path integral is depicted in figure 23a.\r
The partition function Zβ = tr(e\r
−βH) is obtained by setting φ1 = φ0 and integrating\r
over φ0, which is equivalent to defining the path integral on a space with periodic\r
36Alternatively, this is the set of all points on Sd × R spacelike separated from the point p.\r

at the spatial region A at τ = 0. We will denote this spacetime with the cut by MA.\r
It is now straightforward to describe a path integral calculation of the Renyi en\u0002tropies (21) and entanglement entropy (17). To calculated tr(ρ\r

cyclically gluing them together with the fields below the cut one each copy taken\r
to be continuous with the fields above the cut in the next copy. This is depicted in\r
figure 23f.\r
In order to calculate the entanglement entropy, the standard method (known as\r
the “replica trick”) is to find an analytic expression for the Renyi entropies Sα in (21)\r
68

calculated using (161) and then take the limit α → 1. Alternatively, we can define\r
the entanglement entropy in terms of the integer Renyi entropies by various integral\r
identities, for example\r

n=0\r

The calculation of entanglement entropy (32) for an interval in 2D CFTs can be carried\r
out directly using these path integral methods, as explained in [18].\r
Vacuum density matrix for a half space\r
Using the path integral technology above, we now derive a universal result for the\r
density matrix of a half-space in the vacuum state of a Lorentz-invariant quantum field\r
theory. Starting from the expression (160), and denoting the region x\r
1 > 0 by R, we\r
have\r

Next, consider the change of variables to polar coordinates in the x\r

r cos(θ), τ = r sin(θ). This gives\r
hφ\r

, (165)\r
Now, we notice that the expression on the right takes the same form as the expression\r
(155) with τ replaced by θ and β replaced by 2π. The expression in (155) defined the\r
density matrix e\r
−βH , where H was the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable\r
t = iτ . We conclude that the expression (164) defines the density matrix e\r
−2πHη\r
, where\r
Hη is the Hamiltonian generating evolution in the variable η = iθ. For this analytically\r
continued angle coordinate, the metric back in Lorentzian space becomes\r
dr2 + r\r
2\r
dθ2 → dr2 − r\r
2\r
dη2, (166)\r
and we can recognize the metric on the right as describing a Rindler wedge of the\r
original Minkowski space, defined as the domain of dependence of the half-space x\r
1 > 0.\r
Explicitly, we have x\r
1 = r cosh(η) and t = r sinh(η). Here η defines ”Rindler time,”\r
and the associated generator Hη is the ordinary boost generator\r
Hη =\r

x1>0\r
d\r

\b\r

The final result is that the density matrix for a half space is the thermal density matrix\r
defined in terms of the boost generator,\r
ρR =\r
1\r
Z\r
e\r
−2πHη\r
. (168)\r
As η can be viewed as the time coordinate for a family of observers on accelerated tra\u0002jectories, this result is closely related to the result of Unruh that accelerated observers\r
(who only have access to the physics in the Rindler wedge) experience thermal physics.\r
Modular Hamiltonians\r
Starting from the result (167,168) for the half-space vacuum density matrix, we can\r
determine various explicit results for modular Hamiltonians in conformal field theory.\r
For reference, we record the results here.\r
For a ball-shaped region B of radius R and center x0 in Minkowski space, the\r
modular Hamiltonian H = − log ρB is given by\r
H = 2π\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
dx\r
R2 − (~x − ~x0)\r
2\r
2R\r
T00 . (169)\r
For a ball-shaped region θ < θ0 on a sphere, we have\r
H = 2π\r
Z\r
B\r
d\r
dx\r
cos(θ) − cos(θ0)\r
sin(θ0)\r
T00 . (170)\r
In the special case of 1+1 dimensional CFTs the modular Hamiltonian can also be\r
calculated for thermal state can be obtained from the vacuum state by a conformal\r
transformation. For a spatial interval [−R, R] in an unboosted thermal state with\r
temperature T = β\r
−1\r
, the modular Hamiltonian is\r
H =\r

An explicit expression for the modular Hamiltonian of a boosted thermal state can be\r
found in [55].\r
