Most are binary black \r

Some are neutron \r

Methods and Inputs\r
● 67 events with false alarm rate (FAR) below ¼ yr-1\r
● masses, spins, and distances of all these events inferred from the gravitational wave \r
signal\r
● Use a hierarchical Bayesian analysis to get an astrophysical distribution of sources\r
● Take selection effects into account\r
● several mass models, 3 spin models, and one distance model for the astrophysical \r
population of sources\r

Full Spectrum of Compact Objects\r
14\r
We are sensitive to two\r
types of compact \r
objects: neutron stars \r
and black holes\r
Three types of mergers: \r
binary neutron star, \r
binary black hole, \r
neutron star - black hole\r
Fundamental Questions:\r
● Which types of \r
mergers are we \r
seeing?\r
● How many are \r
happening in the \r
Universe?

Full Spectrum of Compact Objects\r
15\r
● Models spanning the full spectrum of compact objects allow us to\r
○ Search for a feature between neutron stars and black holes\r
○ Find relative rates of mergers in different parts of the spectrum\r
○ Include ambiguously classified events\r

Five events with a \r

We infer the \r
distribution of NS \r
masses in merging \r
compact binaries from a \r
subset of these events

● Treat low-mass components as NSs if P(m ≤ MTOV) > 50%\r
● Obtain same classifications relative to Mgap instead of MTOV\r

which allows us to classify the two types of objects

Modeled searches\r
● GstLAL, MBTA, PyCBC Broad, \r
PyCBC BBH\r
● Assume the source is CBC. \r
● Uses matched filtering and \r
banks of template waveforms \r
with varying parameters to \r
find signals in the data.\r
● HL, HV, LV, HLV coincidences.\r
● GstLAL allows for single \r
detector candidates.\r
Minimally modeled search\r
● CWB\r
● Can potentially identify \r
non-CBC sources. \r
● Does not use matched \r
filtering or waveforms. \r
● Identifies excess power in \r
coincident strain data to \r
find signals.\r
● HL, HV, LV coincidences.\r
Same methods as \r
GWTC-2.1 (GstLAL, \r
MBTA, PyCBC) and \r
GWTC-2 (cWB).\r
Descriptions of \r
pipelines are given \r
with more details in \r
Section IV and \r
Appendix D of the \r
paper. 

Population-weighted posteriors\r
60\r
With growing \r
catalog we can use \r
the population as \r
the prior for our \r
event posteriors.\r
More details in \r
Appendix E of the \r
paper. \r
Original, PP, FM\r
● Event posteriors reweighted with Power law + Peak (PP), Flexible Mixtures (FM)\r
● For some events: q~1 preferred, PP and FM models disagree (with PP model \r
pulling distribution towards ) 

Event selection criterion\r
● This work and GWTC-3 use different \r
criteria for what constitutes a GW \r
event\r
○ GWTC-3 uses the probability that a \r
trigger is astrophysical (pastro)\r
○ We use the false alarm rate (FAR) as \r
the metric for inclusion\r
● Relaxed criteria means we can analyze \r
events like GW200105\r
○ Neutron star-black hole event\r
○ FAR of ~⅕ years, but pastro of .36\r
● What’s the difference?\r
○ Potential GW events are assigned a \r
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on \r
their “loudness”\r
○ FAR describes how frequently \r
background noise should make a \r
signal with an SNR greater than the \r
event’s SNR\r
○ Using a population model, we can \r
estimate how frequently binaries \r
with a given combination of masses \r
and spins are observed\r
○ Using this event rate and FAR, we \r
compute pastro for a given GW event\r
61\r
We use the false alarm \r
rate (FAR) to \r
determine which \r
triggers we should \r
analyze\r
Events with a FAR<1/1 \r
year are studied in this \r
work\r

● Event posteriors reweighted with Power law + Peak (PP), Flexible Mixtures (FM)\r

Event selection criterion\r
● This work and GWTC-3 use different \r
criteria for what constitutes a GW \r
event\r
○ GWTC-3 uses the probability that a \r
trigger is astrophysical (pastro)\r
○ We use the false alarm rate (FAR) as \r
the metric for inclusion\r
● Relaxed criteria means we can analyze \r
events like GW200105\r
○ Neutron star-black hole event\r
○ FAR of ~⅕ years, but pastro of .36\r
● What’s the difference?\r
○ Potential GW events are assigned a \r
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) based on \r
their “loudness”\r
○ FAR describes how frequently \r
background noise should make a \r
signal with an SNR greater than the \r
event’s SNR\r
○ Using a population model, we can \r
estimate how frequently binaries \r
with a given combination of masses \r
and spins are observed\r
○ Using this event rate and FAR, we \r
compute pastro for a given GW event"""
