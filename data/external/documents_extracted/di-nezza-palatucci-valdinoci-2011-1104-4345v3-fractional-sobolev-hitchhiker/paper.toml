Abstract\r
This paper deals with the fractional Sobolev spaces Ws,p. We analyze the\r
relations among some of their possible definitions and their role in the trace\r
theory. We prove continuous and compact embeddings, investigating the\r
problem of the extension domains and other regularity results.\r
Most of the results we present here are probably well known to the ex\u0002perts, but we believe that our proofs are original and we do not make use\r
of any interpolation techniques nor pass through the theory of Besov spaces.\r
We also present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains.\r
Keywords: Fractional Sobolev spaces, Gagliardo norm, fractional\r

1. Introduction\r
These pages are for students and young researchers of all ages who\r
may like to hitchhike their way from 1 to s ∈ (0, 1). To wit, for anybody\r
who, only endowed with some basic undergraduate analysis course (and\r
knowing where his towel is), would like to pick up some quick, crash and\r
essentially self-contained information on the fractional Sobolev spaces Ws,p.\r
The reasons for such a hitchhiker to start this adventurous trip might\r
be of different kind: (s)he could be driven by mathematical curiosity,\r
or could be tempted by the many applications that fractional calculus\r
seems to have recently experienced. In a sense, fractional Sobolev spaces\r
have been a classical topic in functional and harmonic analysis all along,\r
and some important books, such as [59, 90] treat the topic in detail.\r
On the other hand, fractional spaces, and the corresponding nonlocal\r
2

equations, are now experiencing impressive applications in different sub\u0002jects, such as, among others, the thin obstacle problem [87, 69], opti\u0002mization [37], finance [26], phase transitions [2, 14, 88, 40, 45], stratified\r
materials [83, 23, 24], anomalous diffusion [68, 98, 65], crystal disloca\u0002tion [92, 47, 8], soft thin films [57], semipermeable membranes and flame\r
propagation [15], conservation laws [9], ultra-relativistic limits of quan\u0002tum mechanics [41], quasi-geostrophic flows [64, 27, 21], multiple scatter\u0002ing [36, 25, 50], minimal surfaces [16, 20], materials science [4], water\r
waves [81, 100, 99, 32, 29, 74, 33, 34, 31, 30, 42, 51, 75, 35], elliptic\r
problems with measure data [71, 54], non-uniformly elliptic problems [39],\r
gradient potential theory [72] and singular set of minima of variational\r
functionals [70, 56]. Don’t panic, instead, see also [86, 87] for further\r
motivation.\r
For these reasons, we thought that it could be of some interest to write\r
down these notes – or, more frankly, we wrote them just because if you\r
really want to understand something, the best way is to try and\r
explain it to someone else.\r
Some words may be needed to clarify the style of these pages have been\r
gathered. We made the effort of making a rigorous exposition, starting from\r
scratch, trying to use the least amount of technology and with the simplest,\r
low-profile language we could use – since capital letters were always\r
the best way of dealing with things you didn’t have a good answer\r
to.\r
Differently from many other references, we make no use of Besov spaces4\r
or interpolation techniques, in order to make the arguments as elementary\r
as possible and the exposition suitable for everybody, since when you are\r
a student or whatever, and you can’t afford a car, or a plane fare,\r
or even a train fare, all you can do is hope that someone will stop\r
and pick you up, and it’s nice to think that one could, even here\r
and now, be whisked away just by hitchhiking.\r
Of course, by dropping fine technologies and powerful tools, we will miss\r
several very important features, and we apologize for this. So, we highly\r
4About this, we would like to quote [53], according to which “The paradox of Besov\r
spaces is that the very thing that makes them so successful also makes them very\r
difficult to present and to learn”.\r

recommend all the excellent, classical books on the topic, such as [59, 90, 1,\r
93, 94, 101, 80, 91, 67, 60], and the many references given therein. Without\r
them, our reader would remain just a hitchhiker, losing the opportunity of\r
performing the next crucial step towards a full mastering of the subject\r
and becoming the captain of a spaceship.\r
In fact, compared to other Guides, this one is not definitive, and it\r
is a very evenly edited book and contains many passages that simply\r
seemed to its editors a good idea at the time. In any case, of course,\r
we know that we cannot solve any major problems just with potatoes\r
– it’s fun to try and see how far one can get though.\r
In this sense, while most of the results we present here are probably well\r
known to the experts, we believe that the exposition is somewhat original.\r
These are the topics we cover. In Section 2, we define the fractional\r
Sobolev spaces Ws,p via the Gagliardo approach and we investigate some\r
of their basic properties. In Section 3 we focus on the Hilbert case p = 2,\r
dealing with its relation with the fractional Laplacian, and letting the\r
principal value integral definition interplay with the definition in the Fourier\r
space. Then, in Section 4 we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the\r
constant factor that appears in the definition of the fractional Laplacian.\r
Section 5 is devoted to the extension problem of a function in Ws,p(Ω)\r
to Ws,p(Rn): technically, this is slightly more complicated than the classi\u0002cal analogue for integer Sobolev spaces, since the extension interacts with\r
the values taken by the function in Ω via the Gagliardo norm and the\r
computations have to take care of it.\r
Sobolev inequalities and continuous embeddings are dealt with in Sec\u0002tion 6, while Section 7 is devoted to compact embeddings. Then, in Sec\u0002tion 8, we point out that functions in Ws,p are continuous when sp is large\r
enough.\r
In Section 9, we present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz do\u0002mains.\r
After that, we hope that our hitchhiker reader has enjoyed his trip from\r
the integer Sobolev spaces to the fractional ones, with the advantages\r
of being able to get more quickly from one place to another -\r
particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as\r
a result of this, very similar to the place you had left.\r
The above sentences written in old-fashioned fonts are Douglas\r

Adams’s of course, and we took the latitude of adapting their meanings to\r
our purposes. The rest of these pages are written in a more conventional,\r
may be boring, but hopefully rigorous, style.\r
2. The fractional Sobolev space Ws,p\r
This section is devoted to the definition of the fractional Sobolev spaces.\r
No prerequisite is needed. We just recall the definition of the Fourier\r
transform of a distribution. First, consider the Schwartz space S of rapidly\r
decaying C\r
∞ functions in Rn\r
. The topology of this space is generated by\r
the seminorms\r
pN (ϕ) = sup\r
x∈Rn\r
(1 + |x|)\r
N X\r
|α|≤N\r
|D\r
αϕ(x)| , N = 0, 1, 2, ... ,\r
where ϕ ∈ S (Rn). Let S ′(Rn) be the set of all tempered distributions,\r
that is the topological dual of S (Rn). As usual, for any ϕ ∈ S (Rn), we\r
denote by\r
Fϕ(ξ) = 1\r
(2π)\r
n/2\r
Z\r
Rn\r
e\r
−iξ·x ϕ(x) dx\r
the Fourier transform of ϕ and we recall that one can extend F from\r
S (Rn) to S ′(Rn).\r
Let Ω be a general, possibly non smooth, open set in Rn. For any real\r
s > 0 and for any p ∈ [1, ∞), we want to define the fractional Sobolev\r
spaces Ws,p(Ω). In the literature, fractional Sobolev-type spaces are also\r
called Aronszajn, Gagliardo or Slobodeckij spaces, by the name of the ones\r
who introduced them, almost simultaneously (see [3, 44, 89]).\r
We start by fixing the fractional exponent s in (0, 1). For any p ∈\r
[1, +∞), we define Ws,p(Ω) as follows\r
Ws,p(Ω) := (u ∈ L\r
p\r
(Ω) : |u(x) − u(y)|\r
|x − y|\r
n\r
p +s\r
∈ L\r
p\r
(Ω × Ω)); (2.1)\r
i.e, an intermediary Banach space between L\r
p\r
(Ω) and W1,p(Ω), endowed\r
with the natural norm\r

p\r

n+sp\r

p\r
is the so-called Gagliardo (semi)norm of u.\r
It is worth noticing that, as in the classical case with s being an integer,\r
the space Ws\r
′\r
,p is continuously embedded in Ws,p when s ≤ s′\r
, as next\r
result points out.\r
Proposition 2.1. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and 0 < s ≤ s\r
′ < 1. Let Ω be an open\r
set in Rn and u : Ω → R be a measurable function. Then\r
kukWs,p(Ω) ≤ CkukWs′,p(Ω)\r
for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1. In particular,\r
Ws\r
′\r
,p(Ω) ⊆ Ws,p(Ω).\r
Proof. First,\r

where we used the fact that the kernel 1/|z|\r

Taking into account the above estimate, it follows\r

p\r
Ws′,p(Ω),\r
which gives the desired estimate, up to relabeling the constant C(n, p, s).\r
We will show in the forthcoming Proposition 2.2 that the result in\r
Proposition 2.1 holds also in the limit case, namely when s\r
′ = 1, but for\r
this we have to take into account the regularity of ∂Ω (see Example 9.1).\r
As usual, for any k ∈ N and α ∈ (0, 1], we say that Ω is of class C\r
k,α if\r
there exists M > 0 such that for any x ∈ ∂Ω there exists a ball B = Br(x),\r
r > 0, and an isomorphism T : Q → B such that\r
T ∈ C\r
k,α(Q), T −1 ∈ Ck,α(B), T(Q+) = B ∩ Ω, T(Q0) = B ∩ ∂Ω\r
and kTkCk,α(Q) + kT\r
−1\r
kCk,α(B) ≤ M,\r
where\r
Q := \bx = (x\r
′\r
, xn) ∈ R\r
n−1 × R : |x′\r
| < 1 and |xn| < 1\r
\t\r
,\r
Q+ := \bx = (x\r
′\r
, xn) ∈ R\r
n−1 × R : |x′\r
| < 1 and 0 < xn < 1\r
\t\r
and Q0 := {x ∈ Q : xn = 0} .\r
We have the following result.\r
7

Proposition 2.2. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and s ∈ (0, 1). Let Ω be an open set\r
in Rn of class C\r
0,1 with bounded boundary and u : Ω → R be a measurable\r
function. Then\r
kukWs,p(Ω) ≤ CkukW1,p(Ω) (2.5)\r
for some suitable positive constant C = C(n, s, p) ≥ 1. In particular,\r
W1,p(Ω) ⊆ Ws,p(Ω).\r
Proof. Let u ∈ W1,p(Ω). Thanks to the regularity assumptions on the\r
domain Ω, we can extend u to a function ˜u : Rn → R such that ˜u ∈\r
W1,p(Rn) and ku˜kW1,p(Rn) ≤ CkukW1,p(Ω) for a suitable constant C (see,\r
e.g., [49, Theorem 7.25]).\r
Now, using the change of variable z = y − x and the H¨older inequality,\r
we have\r

Therefore, from (2.6) and (2.7) we get estimate (2.5).\r
We remark that the Lipschitz assumption in Proposition 2.2 cannot be\r
completely dropped (see Example 9.1 in Section 9); we also refer to the\r
forthcoming Section 5, in which we discuss the extension problem in Ws,p\r
.\r
Let us come back to the definition of the space Ws,p(Ω). Before going\r
ahead, it is worth explaining why the definition in (2.1) cannot be plainly\r
extended to the case s ≥ 1. Suppose that Ω is a connected open set in Rn,\r
then any measurable function u : Ω → R such that\r
Z\r
Ω\r
Z\r
Ω\r
|u(x) − u(u)|\r
p\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
dx dy < +∞\r
is actually constant (see [10, Proposition 2]). This fact is a matter of\r
scaling and it is strictly related to the following result that holds for any\r
u in W1,p(Ω):\r
lim\r
s→1−\r

Z\r
Ω\r
|∇u|\r
p\r
dx (2.8)\r
for a suitable positive constant C1 depending only on n and p (see [11]).\r
In the same spirit, in [66], Maz’ja and Shaposhnikova proved that, for\r
a function u ∈\r
S\r
0<s<1 Ws,p(Rn\r
), it yields\r
lim\r
s→0+\r

|u|\r
p\r
dx, (2.9)\r
for a suitable positive constant C2 depending5 only on n and p.\r
When s > 1 and it is not an integer we write s = m + σ, where m\r
is an integer and σ ∈ (0, 1). In this case the space Ws,p(Ω) consists of\r
those equivalence classes of functions u ∈ W m,p(Ω) whose distributional\r
derivatives Dαu, with |α| = m, belong to Wσ,p(Ω), namely\r
Ws,p(Ω) := nu ∈ W m,p(Ω) : D\r
αu ∈ Wσ,p(Ω) for any α s.t. |α| = m\r
o\r
(2.10)\r
5For the sake of simplicity, in the definition of the fractional Sobolev spaces and those\r
of the corresponding norms in (2.1) and (2.2) we avoided any normalization constant.\r
In view of (2.8) and (2.9), it is worthing notice that, in order to recover the classical\r
W1,p and L\r
p\r
spaces, one may consider to add a factor C(n, p, s) ≈ s(1 − s) in front of\r
the double integral in (2.2).\r
9

and this is a Banach space with respect to the norm\r
kukWs,p(Ω) :=\r

. (2.11)\r
Clearly, if s = m is an integer, the space Ws,p(Ω) coincides with the Sobolev\r
space W m,p(Ω).\r
Corollary 2.3. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and s, s′ > 1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn\r
of class C\r
0,1\r
. Then, if s\r
′ ≥ s, we have\r
Ws\r
′\r
,p(Ω) ⊆ Ws,p(Ω).\r
Proof. We write s = k + σ and s\r
′ = k′ + σ′\r
, with k, k′integers and σ, σ′ ∈\r
(0, 1). In the case k\r
′ = k, we can use Proposition 2.1 in order to conclude\r
that Ws\r
′\r
,p(Ω) is continuously embedded in Ws,p(Ω). On the other hand, if\r
k\r
′ ≥ k + 1, using Proposition 2.1 and Proposition 2.2 we have the following\r
chain\r
Wk\r
′+σ′\r
,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk\r
′\r
,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk+1,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk+σ,p(Ω).\r
The proof is complete.\r
As in the classic case with s being an integer, any function in the\r
fractional Sobolev space Ws,p(Rn) can be approximated by a sequence of\r
smooth functions with compact support.\r
Theorem 2.4. For any s > 0, the space C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Rn) of smooth functions with\r
compact support is dense in Ws,p(Rn).\r
A proof can be found in [1, Theorem 7.38].\r
Let W\r
s,p\r
0\r
(Ω) denote the closure of C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Ω) in the norm k·kWs,p(Ω) defined\r
in (2.11). Note that, in view of Theorem 2.4, we have\r
W\r
s,p\r
0\r
(R\r
n\r
) = Ws,p(R\r
n\r
), (2.12)\r
but in general, for Ω ⊂ Rn, Ws,p(Ω) 6= W\r
s,p\r
0\r
(Ω), i.e. C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Ω) is not dense in\r
Ws,p(Ω). Furthermore, it is clear that the same inclusions stated in Propo\u0002sition 2.1, Proposition 2.2 and Corollary 2.3 hold for the spaces W\r
s,p\r
0\r
(Ω).\r
10

Remark 2.5. For s < 0 and p ∈ (1, ∞), we can define Ws,p(Ω) as the dual\r
space of W\r
−s,q\r
0\r
(Ω) where 1/p+ 1/q = 1. Notice that, in this case, the space\r
Ws,p(Ω) is actually a space of distributions on Ω, since it is the dual of a\r
space having C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Ω) as density subset.\r
Finally, it is worth noticing that the fractional Sobolev spaces play an\r
important role in the trace theory. Precisely, for any p ∈ (1, +∞), assume\r
that the open set Ω ⊆ Rnis sufficiently smooth, then the space of traces T u\r
on ∂Ω of u in W1,p(Ω) is characterized by kT uk\r
W\r
1− 1\r
p\r
,p(∂Ω)\r
< +∞ (see [43]).\r
Moreover, the trace operator T is surjective from W1,p(Ω) onto W\r
1− 1\r
p\r
,p(∂Ω).\r
In the quadratic case p = 2, the situation simplifies considerably, as we will\r
see in the next section and a proof of the above trace embedding can be\r
find in the forthcoming Proposition 3.8.\r
3. The space Hs and the fractional Laplacian operator\r
In this section, we focus on the case p = 2. This is quite an important\r
case since the fractional Sobolev spaces Ws,2(Rn) and W\r

respectively. Moreover, they are strictly related to the fractional Laplacian\r
operator (−∆)s(see Proposition 3.6), where, for any u ∈ S and s ∈ (0, 1),\r
(−∆)sis defined as\r

Here P.V. is a commonly used abbreviation for “in the principal value\r

Remark 3.1. Due to the singularity of the kernel, the right hand-side of\r
(3.1) is not well defined in general. In the case s ∈ (0, 1/2) the integral in\r
(3.1) is not really singular near x. Indeed, for any u ∈ S , we have\r

Now, we show that one may write the singular integral in (3.1) as a\r
weighted second order differential quotient.\r
Lemma 3.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let (−∆)sbe the fractional Laplacian\r
operator defined by (3.1). Then, for any u ∈ S ,\r
(−∆)su(x) = −\r

(3.3)\r
Proof. The equivalence of the definitions in (3.1) and (3.3) immediately\r
follows by the standard changing variable formula.\r
Indeed, by choosing z = y − x, we have\r
(−∆)su(x) = − C(n, s) P.V.Z\r
Rn\r
u(y) − u(x)\r
|x − y|\r

Moreover, by substituting ˜z = −z in last term of the above equality, we\r
have\r
P.V.Z\r
Rn\r
u(x + z) − u(x)\r
|z|\r
n+2s\r
dz = P.V.Z\r
Rn\r
u(x − z˜) − u(x)\r

and so after relabeling ˜z as z\r

= P.V.Z\r

= P.V.Z\r
Rn\r
u(x + z) + u(x − z) − 2u(x)\r
|z|\r

Therefore, if we rename z as y in (3.4) and (3.6), we can write the fractional\r
Laplacian operator in (3.1) as\r
(−∆)su(x) = −\r

C(n, s) P.V.Z\r
Rn\r
u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)\r
|y|\r

The above representation is useful to remove the singularity of the integral\r
at the origin. Indeed, for any smooth function u, a second order Taylor\r
expansion yields\r
u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)\r
|y|\r
n+2s\r
≤\r
kD2ukL∞\r
|y|\r

which is integrable near 0 (for any fixed s ∈ (0, 1)). Therefore, since u ∈ S ,\r
one can get rid of the P.V. and write (3.3).\r
3.1. An approach via the Fourier transform\r
Now, we take into account an alternative definition of the space Hs(Rn) =\r
Ws,2(Rn) via the Fourier transform. Precisely, we may define\r
Hˆ s(R\r
n\r
) = \u001Au ∈ L\r
2\r
(R\r
n\r
) : Z\r
Rn\r
(1 + |ξ|\r
2s\r
)|Fu(ξ)|\r
2\r
dξ < +∞\r
\u001B\r
(3.7)\r
and we observe that the above definition, unlike the ones via the Gagliardo\r
norm in (2.2), is valid also for any real s ≥ 1.\r
We may also use an analogous definition for the case s < 0 by setting\r
Hˆ s(R\r
n\r
) = \u001Au ∈ S ′(R\r
n\r
) : Z\r
Rn\r
(1 + |ξ|\r
2\r
)\r
s\r
|Fu(ξ)|\r
2\r
dξ < +∞\r
\u001B\r
,\r
13

although in this case the space Hˆ s\r
(Rn) is not a subset of L\r
2\r
(Rn) and, in\r
order to use the Fourier transform, one has to start from an element of\r
S ′(Rn), (see also Remark 2.5).\r
The equivalence of the space Hˆ s(Rn) defined in (3.7) with the one\r
defined in the previous section via the Gagliardo norm (see (2.1)) is stated\r
and proven in the forthcoming Proposition 3.4.\r
First, we will prove that the fractional Laplacian (−∆)scan be viewed\r
as a pseudo-differential operator of symbol |ξ|\r
2s\r
. The proof is standard and\r
it can be found in many papers (see, for instance, [91, Chapter 16]). We\r
will follow the one in [97] (see Section 3), in which is shown how singular\r
integrals naturally arise as a continuous limit of discrete long jump random\r
walks.\r
Proposition 3.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let (−∆)s: S → L\r
2\r
(Rn) be the\r
fractional Laplacian operator defined by (3.1). Then, for any u ∈ S ,\r
(−∆)su = F−1(|ξ|\r
2s\r
(Fu)) ∀ξ ∈ R\r
n\r
. (3.8)\r
Proof. In view of Lemma 3.2, we may use the definition via the weighted\r
second order differential quotient in (3.3). We denote by L u the integral\r
in (3.3), that is\r
L u(x) = −\r
1\r
2\r
C(n, s)\r
Z\r
Rn\r
u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)\r
|y|\r
n+2s\r
dy,\r
with C(n, s) as in (3.2).\r
L is a linear operator and we are looking for its “symbol” (or “multiplier”),\r
that is a function S : Rn → R such that\r
L u = F−1(S(Fu)). (3.9)\r
We want to prove that\r
S(ξ) = |ξ|\r
2s\r
, (3.10)\r
where we denoted by ξ the frequency variable. To this scope, we point out\r
that\r
|u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)|\r
|y|\r

Consequently, by the Fubini-Tonelli’s Theorem, we can exchange the in\u0002tegral in y with the Fourier transform in x. Thus, we apply the Fourier\r
transform in the variable x in (3.9) and we obtain\r
S(ξ)(Fu)(ξ) = F(L u)\r
= −\r

Hence, in order to obtain (3.10), it suffices to show that\r

|y|\r
n+2s\r
dy = C(n, s)\r
−1\r
|ξ|\r

. (3.12)\r
To check this, first we observe that, if ζ = (ζ1, ..., ζn) ∈ Rn, we have\r
1 − cos ζ1\r
|ζ|\r
n+2s\r
≤\r
|ζ1|\r
2\r
|ζ|\r

near ζ = 0. Thus,\r
Z\r
Rn\r
1 − cos ζ1\r
|ζ|\r
n+2s\r
dζ is finite and positive. (3.13)\r
Now, we consider the function I : Rn → R defined as follows\r
I(ξ) = Z\r
Rn\r
1 − cos (ξ · y)\r
|y|\r
n+2s\r
dy.\r
We have that I is rotationally invariant, that is\r
I(ξ) = I(|ξ|e1), (3.14)\r
where e1 denotes the first direction vector in Rn. Indeed, when n = 1,\r
then we can deduce (3.14) by the fact that I(−ξ) = I(ξ). When n ≥ 2,\r
15

we consider a rotation R for which R(|ξ|e1) = ξ and we denote by RT\r
its\r
transpose. Then, by substituting ˜y = RTy, we obtain\r
I(ξ) = Z\r
Rn\r
1 − cos (R(|ξ|e1)) · y\r
\u0001\r
|y|\r

\u0001\r
|y˜|\r
n+2s\r
dy˜ = I(|ξ|e1),\r
which proves (3.14).\r
As a consequence of (3.13) and (3.14), the substitution ζ = |ξ|y gives\r
that\r
I(ξ) = I(|ξ|e1)\r
=\r

Hence, we deduce (3.12) and then the proof is complete.\r
Proposition 3.4. Let s ∈ (0, 1). Then the fractional Sobolev space Hs(Rn)\r
defined in Section 2 coincides with Hˆ s\r
(Rn) defined in (3.7). In particular,\r

This completes the proof.\r
Remark 3.5. The equivalence of the spaces Hs and Hˆ sstated in Proposi\u0002tion 3.4 relies on Plancherel Formula. As well known, unless p = q = 2,\r
one cannot go forward and backward between an L\r
p and an Lq via Fourier\r
transform (see, for instance, the sharp inequality in [5] for the case 1 <\r
p < 2 and q equal to the conjugate exponent p/(p − 1) ). That is why the\r
general fractional space defined via Fourier transform for 1 < p < ∞ and\r
s > 0, say Hs,p(Rn), does not coincide with the fractional Sobolev spaces\r
Ws,p(Rn) and will be not discussed here (see, e.g., [101]).\r
Finally, we are able to prove the relation between the fractional Lapla\u0002cian operator (−∆)s and the fractional Sobolev space Hs\r
.\r
17

Proposition 3.6. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let u ∈ Hs\r
(Rn). Then,\r

Hs(Rn) = 2C(n, s)\r
−1\r
k(−∆) s\r
2 uk\r
2\r

where C(n, s) is defined by (3.2).\r
Proof. The equality in (3.15) plainly follows from Proposition 3.3 and\r
Proposition 3.4. Indeed,\r
k(−∆) s\r
2 uk\r
2\r
L2(Rn) = kF(−∆) s\r

L2(Rn) = k|ξ|\r

=\r
1\r

2\r

.\r
Remark 3.7. In the same way as the fractional Laplacian (−∆)sis related\r
to the space Ws,2\r
\r
as its Euler-Lagrange equation or from the formula\r
kuk\r
2\r
Ws,2 =\r
R\r
u(−∆)su dx \u0001, a more general integral operator can be defined\r
that is related to the space Ws,p for any p (see the recent paper [52]).\r
Armed with the definition of Hs(Rn) via the Fourier transform, we\r
can easily analyze the traces of the Sobolev functions (see the forthcom\u0002ing Proposition 3.8). We will follow Sections 13, 15 and 16 in [91].\r
Let Ω ⊆ Rn be an open set with continuous boundary ∂Ω. Denote by\r
T the trace operator, namely the linear operator defined by the uniformly\r
continuous extension of the operator of restriction to ∂Ω for functions\r
in D(Ω), that is the space of functions C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Rn) restricted6to Ω.\r
Now, for any x = (x\r
′\r
, xn) ∈ Rn and for any u ∈ S (Rn), we denote by\r
v ∈ S (Rn−1) the restriction of u on the hyperplane xn = 0, that is\r
v(x\r
′\r
) = u(x\r
′\r
, 0) ∀x\r
′ ∈ Rn−1\r
. (3.16)\r
Then, we have\r
Fv(ξ\r

) = Z\r
R\r
Fu(ξ\r
′\r
, ξn) dξn ∀ξ\r
′ ∈ Rn−1\r
, (3.17)\r
6 Notice that we cannot simply take T as the restriction operator to the boundary,\r
since the restriction to a set of measure 0 (like the set ∂Ω) is not defined for functions\r
which are not smooth enough.\r
18

where, for the sake of simplicity, we keep the same symbol F for both the\r
Fourier transform in n − 1 and in n variables.\r
To check (3.17), we write\r

where the last equality follows by transforming and anti-transforming u in\r
the last variable, and this coincides with (3.18).\r
Now, we are in position to characterize the traces of the function\r
in Hs(Rn), as stated in the following proposition.\r
Proposition 3.8. ([91, Lemma 16.1]). Let s > 1/2, then any function\r
u ∈ Hs(Rn) has a trace v on the hyperplane \bxn = 0\t, such that v ∈\r
Hs− 1\r
2 (Rn−1\r
). Also, the trace operator T is surjective from Hs(Rn) onto\r
Hs− 1\r
2 (Rn−1\r
).\r
Proof. In order to prove the first claim, it suffices to show that there exists\r
an universal constant C such that, for any u ∈ S (Rn) and any v defined\r
as in (3.16),\r
kvk\r

Now, we will prove the surjectivity of the trace operator T. For this,\r
we show that for any v ∈ Hs− 1\r

R\r
ϕ(t) dt = 1, is such that u ∈ Hs(Rn) and T u = v.\r
Indeed, we integrate (3.22) with respect to ξn ∈ R, we substitute ξn =\r

and this implies v = T u because of (3.17).\r

Remark 3.9. We conclude this section by recalling that the fractional Lapla\u0002cian (−∆)s\r
, which is a nonlocal operator on functions defined in Rn, may\r
be reduced to a local, possibly singular or degenerate, operator on func\u0002tions sitting in the higher dimensional half-space R\r
n+1\r
+ = Rn × (0, +∞).\r
We have\r

where the function U : R\r

+ → R solves div(t\r
1−2s∇U) = 0 in R\r

U(x, 0) = u(x) in Rn.\r
This approach was pointed out by Caffarelli and Silvestre in [19]; see, in\r
particular, Section 3.2 there, where was also given an equivalent definition\r
of the Hs(Rn)-norm:\r

The cited results turn out to be very fruitful in order to recover an\r
elliptic PDE approach in a nonlocal framework, and they have recently\r
been used very often (see, e.g., [18, 88, 13, 17, 78], etc.).\r

4. Asymptotics of the constant C(n, s)\r
In this section, we go into detail on the constant factor C(n, s) that\r
appears in the definition of the fractional Laplacian (see (3.1)), by analyzing\r
its asymptotic behavior as s → 1\r
− and s → 0+. This is relevant if one\r
wants to recover the Sobolev norms of the spaces H1(Rn) and L\r
2\r
(Rn) by\r
starting from the one of Hs(Rn).\r
We recall that in Section 3, the constant C(n, s) has been defined by\r
C(n, s) = \u0012Z\r

Precisely, we are interested in analyzing the asymptotic behavior as s → 0\r

and s → 1\r

formula.\r

Proposition 4.1. For any n > 1, let A and B be defined by (4.1) and (4.2)\r
respectively. The following statements hold:\r

n\r
2\r
and the function in the right hand-side of the above inequality belongs\r
to L\r
1\r
((0, +∞)) for any n > 1.\r
Then, the Dominated Convergence Theorem yields\r
lim\r
s→1−\r
A(n, s) = ωn−2\r

This proves (i) and (ii).\r
Now, we want to prove (iii). First, we split the integral in (4.2) as follows\r

Also, we have that\r

for some suitable positive constant C.\r
From the above estimates it follows that\r

Similarly, we can prove (iv). For this we notice that\r

Finally, (4.3) and (4.4) easily follow combining the previous estimates\r
and recalling that\r
C(n, s) = s(1 − s)\r
A(n, s)B(s)\r
.\r
The proof is complete.\r
Corollary 4.2. For any n > 1, let C(n, s) be defined by (3.2). The\r
following statements hold:\r
(i) lim\r
s→1−\r
C(n, s)\r
s(1 − s)\r
=\r
4n\r

;\r
(ii) lim\r

C(n, s)\r

=\r
2\r
ωn−1\r
.\r
where ωn−1 denotes the (n−1)-dimensional measure of the unit sphere S\r
n−1\r
.\r
Proof. For any θ ∈ R such that θ > n − 1, let us define\r
En(θ) := Z +∞\r
0\r
ρ\r
n−2\r
(1 + ρ\r
2\r
)\r
θ\r
2\r
dρ.\r
26

Observe that the assumption on the parameter θ ensures the convergence\r
of the integral. Furthermore, integrating by parts we get\r
En(θ) = 1\r
n − 1\r
Z +∞\r
0\r
(ρ\r
n−1\r
)\r

En+2(θ + 2). (4.5)\r
Then, we set\r
I\r

n\r
:= En(n + 2) = Z +∞\r

ρ\r
n−2\r
(1 + ρ\r

:= En(n) = Z +∞\r
0\r
ρ\r
n−2\r
(1 + ρ\r

n\r
2\r
dρ.\r
In view of (4.5), it follows that I\r
(1)\r
n and I\r
(0)\r
n can be obtained in a recursive\r
way, since\r
I\r
(1)\r
n+2 = En+2(n + 4) = n − 1\r
n + 2\r
En(n + 2) = n − 1\r
n + 2\r
I\r

n\r
(4.6)\r
and\r
I\r

n+2 = En+2(n + 2) = n − 1\r
n\r
En(n) = n − 1\r
n\r
I\r

n\r
. (4.7)\r
Now we claim that\r
I\r
(1)\r
n =\r
ωn−1\r
2nωn−2\r
(4.8)\r
and\r
I\r
(0)\r
n =\r
ωn−1\r
2ωn−2\r
. (4.9)\r
We will prove the previous identities by induction. We start by noticing\r
that the inductive basis are satisfied, since\r
I\r
(1)\r
2 =\r
Z +∞\r
0\r
1\r
(1 + ρ\r

dρ =\r

3 =\r

)\r

2\r
dρ =\r

27

and\r
I\r

(1 + ρ\r

dρ =\r

3 =\r
Z +∞\r
0\r
ρ\r
(1 + ρ\r
2)\r
3\r
2\r
dρ = 1.\r
Now, using (4.6) and (4.7), respectively, it is clear that in order to check\r
the inductive steps, it suffices to verify that\r
ωn+1\r
ωn\r
=\r
n − 1\r
n\r
ωn−1\r
ωn−2\r
. (4.10)\r
We claim that the above formula plainly follows from a classical recursive\r
formula on ωn, that is\r
ωn =\r
2π\r
n − 1\r

To prove this, let us denote by ̟n the Lebesgue measure of the n\u0002dimensional unit ball and let us fix the notation x = (˜x, x′\r
) ∈ Rn−2 × R2.\r
By integrating on Rn−2 and then using polar coordinates in R2, we see\r

which is (4.11), up to replacing n with n−1. In turn, (4.11) implies (4.10)\r
and so (4.8) and (4.9).\r

Finally, using (4.8), (4.9) and Proposition 4.1 we can conclude that\r

We will conclude this section with the following proposition that one\r
could plainly deduce from Proposition 3.3. We prefer to provide a di\u0002rect proof, based on Lemma 3.2, in order to show the consistency in the\r
definition of the constant C(n, s).\r
Proposition 4.4. Let n > 1. For any u ∈ C\r

hold:\r
(i) lims→0+ (−∆)su = u;\r
(ii) lims→1− (−∆)su = −∆u.\r

5. Extending a Ws,p(Ω) function to the whole of Rn\r
As well known when s is an integer, under certain regularity assump\u0002tions on the domain Ω, any function in Ws,p(Ω) may be extended to a\r
function in Ws,p(Rn). Extension results are quite important in applica\u0002tions and are necessary in order to improve some embeddings theorems, in\r
the classic case as well as in the fractional case (see Section 6 and Section 7\r
in the following).\r
For any s ∈ (0, 1) and any p ∈ [1, ∞), we say that an open set Ω ⊆\r
Rnis an extension domain for Ws,p if there exists a positive constant\r
C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that: for every function u ∈ Ws,p(Ω) there exists\r
u˜ ∈ Ws,p(Rn) with ˜u(x) = u(x) for all x ∈ Ω and ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω).\r
In general, an arbitrary open set is not an extension domain for Ws,p.\r
To the authors’ knowledge, the problem of characterizing the class of sets\r
that are extension domains for Ws,p is open9\r
. When s is an integer, we\r
cite [58] for a complete characterization in the special case s = 1, p = 2 and\r
n = 2, and we refer the interested reader to the recent book by Leoni [60],\r
in which this problem is very well discussed (see, in particular, Chapter 11\r
and Chapter 12 there).\r
In this section, we will show that any open set Ω of class C\r
0,1 with\r
bounded boundary is an extension domain for Ws,p.\r
We start with some preliminary lemmas, in which we will construct the\r
extension to the whole of Rnof a function u defined on Ω in two separated\r
cases: when the function u is identically zero in a neighborhood of the\r
boundary ∂Ω and when Ω coincides with the half-space Rn\r
+.\r
Lemma 5.1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn and u a function in Ws,p(Ω) with\r
s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞). If there exists a compact subset K ⊂ Ω such\r
that u ≡ 0 in Ω \\ K, then the extension function u˜ defined as\r
u˜(x) = (\r
u(x) x ∈ Ω ,\r
0 x ∈ Rn \\ Ω\r
(5.1)\r
9 While revising this paper, we were informed that an answer to this question has\r
been given by Zhou, by analyzing the link between extension domains in Ws,p and the\r
measure density condition (see [102]).\r

belongs to Ws,p(Rn\r
) and\r
ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω),\r
where C is a suitable positive constant depending on n, p, s, K and Ω.\r
Proof. Clearly ˜u ∈ L\r
p\r
(Rn). Hence, it remains to verify that the Gagliardo\r
norm of ˜u in Rnis bounded by the one of u in Ω. Using the symmetry of\r
the integral in the Gagliardo norm with respect to x and y and the fact\r
that ˜u ≡ 0 in Rn \\ Ω, we can split as follows\r

Note that the integral in (5.3) is finite since dist(∂Ω, ∂K) ≥ α > 0 and\r

ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω)\r
where C = C(n, s, p, K).\r
Lemma 5.2. Let Ω be an open set in Rn, symmetric with respect to\r
the coordinate xn, and consider the sets Ω+ = {x ∈ Ω : xn > 0} and\r
Ω− = {x ∈ Ω : xn ≤ 0}. Let u be a function in Ws,p(Ω+), with s ∈ (0, 1)\r
and p ∈ [1, +∞). Define\r
u¯(x) = (\r
u(x\r
′\r
, xn) xn ≥ 0 ,\r
u(x\r

(5.4)\r
Then u¯ belongs to Ws,p(Ω) and\r
ku¯kWs,p(Ω) ≤ 4kukWs,p(Ω+).\r

Proof. By splitting the integrals and changing variable ˆx = (x\r

This concludes the proof.\r
Now, a truncation lemma near ∂Ω.\r
Lemma 5.3. Let Ω be an open set in Rn, s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞). Let\r
us consider u ∈ Ws,p(Ω) and ψ ∈ C\r
0,1\r
(Ω), 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1. Then ψu ∈ Ws,p(Ω)\r
and\r
kψ ukWs,p(Ω) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω), (5.6)\r
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω).\r
Proof. It is clear that kψ ukLp(Ω) ≤ kukLp(Ω) since |ψ| ≤ 1. Furthermore,\r
adding and subtracting the factor ψ(x)u(y), we get\r

where Λ denotes the Lipschitz constant of ψ and C˜ is a positive constant\r
depending on n, p and s. Note that the last inequality follows from the fact\r
that the kernel |x−y|\r
−n+(1−s)p\r
is summable with respect to y if |x−y| ≤ 1\r
since n + (s − 1)p < n and, on the other hand, the kernel |x − y|\r
−n−sp is\r
summable when |x − y| ≥ 1 since n + sp > n. Finally, combining (5.7) with\r
(5.8), we obtain estimate (5.6).\r
Now, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section, that states\r
that every open Lipschitz set Ω with bounded boundary is an extension\r
domain for Ws,p.\r
Theorem 5.4. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω ⊆ Rnbe an open set of\r
class C\r
0,1 with bounded boundary10. Then Ws,p(Ω) is continuously embedded\r
in Ws,p(Rn), namely for any u ∈ Ws,p(Ω) there exists u˜ ∈ Ws,p(Rn) such\r
that u˜|Ω = u and\r
ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω)\r
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω).\r
Proof. Since ∂Ω is compact, we can find a finite number of balls Bj such\r
that ∂Ω ⊂\r
[\r
k\r
j=1\r
Bj and so we can write R\r
n =\r
[\r
k\r
j=1\r
Bj ∪ (R\r

\\ ∂Ω).\r
If we consider this covering, there exists a partition of unity related\r
to it, i.e. there exist k + 1 smooth functions ψ0, ψ1,..., ψk such that\r
10 Motivated by an interesting remark of the anonymous Referee, we point out that\r
it should be expected that the Lipschitz assumption on the boundary of Ω may be\r
weakened when s ∈ (0, 1), since in the case s = 0 clearly no regularity at all is needed\r
for the extension problem.\r

ψ0 u ≡ 0 in a neighborhood of ∂Ω, we can extend it to the whole of Rn,\r
by setting\r
ψg0 u(x) = (\r
ψ0 u(x) x ∈ Ω,\r
0 x ∈ Rn \\ Ω\r
and ψg0 u ∈ Ws,p(Rn). Precisely\r
kψg0 ukWs,p(Rn) ≤ C kψ0 ukWs,p(Ω) ≤ C kukWs,p(Ω), (5.9)\r
where C = C(n, s, p, Ω) (possibly different step by step, see Lemma 5.1 and\r
Lemma 5.3).\r
For any j ∈ {1, ..., k}, let us consider u|Bj∩Ω and set\r
vj (y) := u (Tj (y)) for any y ∈ Q+,\r
where Tj: Q → Bjis the isomorphism of class C\r
0,1 defined in Section 2.\r
Note that such a Tj exists by the regularity assumption on the domain Ω.\r
Now, we state that vj ∈ Ws,p (Q+). Indeed, using the standard changing\r
variable formula by setting x = Tj (ˆx) we have\r
Z\r

where (5.10) follows from the fact that Tj\r
is bi-Lipschitz. Moreover, using\r
Lemma 5.2 we can extend vj to all Q so that the extension ¯vj belongs to\r
Ws,p(Q) and\r
kv¯jkWs,p(Q) ≤ 4kvjkWs,p(Q+).\r
We set\r
wj (x) := ¯vj\r
\r
T\r
−1\r
j\r

\u0001\r
for any x ∈ Bj.\r
Since Tjis bi-Lipschitz, by arguing as above it follows that wj ∈\r
Ws,p(Bj ). Note that wj ≡ u (and consequently ψj wj ≡ ψj u) on Bj ∩ Ω.\r
By definition ψj wj has compact support in Bj and therefore, as done for\r
ψ0 u, we can consider the extension ψ]j wj to all Rnin such a way that\r
ψ]j wj ∈ Ws,p(Rn). Also, using Lemma 5.1, Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.3 and\r
estimate (5.10) we get\r
kψ]j wjkWs,p(Rn) ≤ Ckψj wjkWs,p(Bj ) ≤ C kwjkWs,p(Bj )\r
≤ Ckv¯jkWs,p(Q) ≤ CkvjkWs,p(Q+)\r
≤ CkukWs,p(Ω∩Bj ), (5.11)\r
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω) and it is possibly different step by step.\r
Finally, let\r
u˜ = ψg0 u +\r
X\r
k\r
j=1\r
ψ]j wj\r
be the extension of u defined on all Rn. By construction, it is clear that\r
u˜|Ω = u and, combining (5.9) with (5.11), we get\r
ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω)\r
with C = C(n, p, s, Ω).\r
Corollary 5.5. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω be an open set in Rn of\r
class C\r
0,1 with bounded boundary. Then for any u ∈ Ws,p(Ω), there exists\r
a sequence {un} ∈ C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Rn) such that un → u as n → +∞ in Ws,p(Ω), i.e.,\r
lim n→+∞kun − ukWs,p(Ω) = 0 .\r

Proof. The proof follows directly by Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 5.4.\r
6. Fractional Sobolev inequalities\r
In this section, we provide an elementary proof of a Sobolev-type in\u0002equality involving the fractional norm k · kWs,p (see Theorem 6.5 below).\r
The original proof is contained in the Appendix of [84] and it deals\r
with the case p = 2 (see, in particular, Theorem 7 there). We note that\r
when p = 2 and s ∈ [1/2, 1) some of the statements may be strengthened\r
(see [10]). We also note that more general embeddings for the spaces Ws,p\r
can be obtained by interpolation techniques and by passing through Besov\r
spaces; see, for instance, [6, 7, 95, 96, 63]. For a more comprehensive\r
treatment of fractional Sobolev-type inequalities we refer to [61, 62, 12, 1,\r
91] and the references therein.\r
We remark that the proof here is self-contained. Moreover, we will not\r
make use of Besov or fancy interpolation spaces.\r
In order to prove the Sobolev-type inequality in forthcoming Theo\u0002rem 6.5, we need some preliminary results. The first of them is an el\u0002ementary estimate involving the measure of finite measurable sets E in\r
Rn as stated in the following lemma (see [85, Lemma A.1] and also [20,\r
Corollary 24 and 25]).\r
Lemma 6.1. Fix x ∈ Rn. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and E ⊂ Rnbe a\r
measurable set with finite measure. Then,\r
Z\r
C E\r
dy\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
≥ C |E|\r
−sp/n\r
,\r
for a suitable constant C = C(n, p, s) > 0.\r
Proof. We set\r
ρ := \u0012\r
|E|\r
ωn\r
\u00131\r
n\r
and then it follows\r
|(C E) ∩ Bρ(x)| = |Bρ(x)| − |E ∩ Bρ(x)| = |E| − |E ∩ Bρ(x)|\r
= |E ∩ C Bρ(x)|.\r

Therefore,\r

The desired result easily follows by using polar coordinates centered at\r
x.\r
Now, we recall a general statement about a useful summability property\r
(see [84, Lemma 5]. For related results, see also [38, Lemma 4]).\r
Lemma 6.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Fix T > 1;\r
let N ∈ Z and\r
ak be a bounded, nonnegative, decreasing sequence\r
with ak = 0 for any k ≥ N.\r
(6.1)\r
Then,\r
X\r
k∈Z\r
a\r
(n−sp)/n\r

k ≤ C\r
X\r
k∈Z\r
ak6=0\r
ak+1a\r
−sp/n\r
k T\r
k\r
,\r
for a suitable constant C = C(n, p, s, T) > 0, independent of N.\r
Proof. By (6.1),\r
both X\r

k T\r
k\r
and X\r
k∈Z\r
ak6=0\r
ak+1a\r
−sp/n\r
k T\r
k\r
are convergent series. (6.2)\r
40

Moreover, since ak is nonnegative and decreasing, we have that if ak = 0,\r
then ak+1 = 0. Accordingly,\r
X\r

So, recalling (6.2), we obtain the desired result.\r
We use the above tools to deal with the measure theoretic properties\r
of the level sets of the functions (see [84, Lemma 6]).\r
Lemma 6.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let\r
f ∈ L\r
∞(Rn\r
) be compactly supported. (6.3)\r
For any k ∈ Z let\r

for a suitable constant C = C(n, p, s) > 0.\r
Proof. Notice that\r
\f\r
\f\r
|f(x)| − |f(y)|\r
\f\r
\f ≤ |f(x) − f(y)|,\r
and so, by possibly replacing f with |f|, we may consider the case in\r
which f ≥ 0.\r
We define\r
Ak := {|f| > 2\r
k\r
}. (6.5)\r
We remark that Ak+1 ⊆ Ak, hence\r
ak+1 ≤ ak. (6.6)\r
We define\r
Dk := Ak \\ Ak+1 = {2\r
k < f ≤ 2k+1} and dk := |Dk|.\r
Notice that\r
dk and ak are bounded and they become zero when k is large enough,\r
(6.7)\r
thanks to (6.3). Also, we observe that the Dk’s are disjoint, that\r
[\r
ℓ∈Z\r
ℓ≤k\r
Dℓ = C Ak+1 (6.8)\r
and that\r
[\r
ℓ∈Z\r
ℓ≥k\r
Dℓ = Ak. (6.9)\r
As a consequence of (6.9), we have that\r
ak =\r
X\r

ℓ≥k\r
dℓ (6.10)\r
and so\r
dk = ak −\r
X\r
ℓ∈Z\r
ℓ≥k+1\r

We stress that the series in (6.10) is convergent, due to (6.7), thus so is\r
the series in (6.11). Similarly, we can define the convergent series\r

any y ∈ Dj we have that\r

Then, the desired result plainly follows from (6.18) and (6.19).\r
Lemma 6.4. Let q ∈ [1, ∞). Let f : Rn → R be a measurable function.\r
For any N ∈ N, let\r
fN (x) := max \bmin{f(x), N}, −N\r
\t\r
∀x ∈ R\r
n\r
. (6.20)\r
Then\r
lim\r
N→+∞\r
kfN kLq(Rn) = kfkLq(Rn).\r
Proof. We denote by |f|N the function obtained by cutting |f| at level N.\r
We have that |f|N = |fN | and so, by Fatou Lemma, we obtain that\r

The reverse inequality easily follows by the fact that |f|N (x) ≤ |f(x)| for\r
any x ∈ Rn.\r
45

Taking into account the previous lemmas, we are able to give an elemen\u0002tary proof of the Sobolev-type inequality stated in the following theorem.\r
Theorem 6.5. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Then\r
there exists a positive constant C = C(n, p, s) such that, for any measurable\r
and compactly supported function f : Rn → R, we have\r

Rn\r

Rn\r
|f(x) − f(y)|\r
p\r

n+sp\r
dx dy. (6.21)\r
where p\r
⋆ = p⋆\r
(n, s) is the so-called “fractional critical exponent” and it is\r
equal to np/(n − sp).\r
Consequently, the space Ws,p(Rn) is continuously embedded in L\r
q\r
(Rn)\r
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆].\r
Proof. First, we note that if the right hand side of (6.21) is unbounded\r
then the claim in the theorem plainly follows. Thus, we may suppose that\r
f is such that\r
Z\r
Rn\r
Z\r
Rn\r
|f(x) − f(y)|\r
p\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
dx dy < +∞. (6.22)\r
Moreover, we can suppose, without loss of generality, that\r
f ∈ L\r
∞(Rn\r
). (6.23)\r
Indeed, if (6.22) holds for bounded functions, then it holds also for the\r
function fN , obtained by any (possibly unbounded) f by cutting at levels\r
−N and +N (see (6.20)). Therefore, by Lemma 6.4 and the fact that (6.22)\r
together with the Dominated Convergence Theorem imply\r

we obtain estimate (6.21) for the function f.\r
Now, take ak and Ak defined by (6.4) and (6.5), respectively. We have\r

for a suitable constant C depending on n, p and s.\r
Finally, it suffices to apply Lemma 6.3 and we obtain the desired result,\r
up to relabeling the constant C in (6.25).\r
Furthermore, the embedding for q ∈ (p, p⋆) follows from standard applica\u0002tion of H¨older inequality.\r
Remark 6.6. From Lemma 6.1, it follows that\r

for all measurable sets E with finite measure.\r
On the other hand, we see that (6.21) reduces to (6.26) when f = χE,\r
so (6.26) (and thus Lemma 6.1) may be seen as a Sobolev-type inequality\r
for sets.\r
The above embedding does not generally hold for the space Ws,p(Ω)\r
since it not always possible to extend a function f ∈ Ws,p(Ω) to a function\r
˜f ∈ Ws,p(Rn\r
). In order to be allowed to do that, we should require further\r
regularity assumptions on Ω (see Section 5).\r
Theorem 6.7. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let\r
Ω ⊆ Rnbe an extension domain for Ws,p. Then there exists a positive\r
constant C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that, for any f ∈ Ws,p(Ω), we have\r
kfkLq(Ω) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω), (6.27)\r
47

for any q ∈ [p, p⋆\r
]; i.e., the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously embedded in L\r
q\r
(Ω)\r
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆].\r
If, in addition, Ω is bounded, then the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously\r
embedded in L\r
q\r
(Ω) for any q ∈ [1, p⋆].\r
Proof. Let f ∈ Ws,p(Ω). Since Ω ⊆ Rnis an extension domain for Ws,p,\r
then there exists a constant C1 = C1(n, p, s, Ω) > 0 such that\r
k\r
˜fkWs,p(Rn) ≤ C1kfkWs,p(Ω), (6.28)\r
with ˜f such that ˜f(x) = f(x) for x a.e. in Ω.\r
On the other hand, by Theorem 6.5, the space Ws,p(Rn\r
) is continuously\r
embedded in L\r
q\r
(Rn) for any q ∈ [p, p⋆]; i.e., there exists a constant C2 =\r
C2(n, p, s) > 0 such that\r
k\r
˜fkLq(Rn) ≤ C2k˜fkWs,p(Rn)\r
. (6.29)\r
Combining (6.28) with (6.29), we get\r
kfkLq(Ω) = k\r
˜fkLq(Ω) ≤ k ˜fkLq(Rn) ≤ C2k˜fkWs,p(Rn)\r
≤ C2C1kfkWs,p(Ω),\r
that gives the inequality in (6.27), by choosing C = C2C1.\r
In the case of Ω being bounded, the embedding for q ∈ [1, p) plainly\r
follows from (6.27), by using the H¨older inequality.\r
Remark 6.8. In the critical case q = p\r
⋆\r
the constant C in Theorem 6.7\r
does not depend on Ω: this is a consequence of (6.21) and of the extension\r
property of Ω.\r
6.1. The case sp = n\r
We note that when sp → n the critical exponent p\r
⋆ goes to ∞ and so\r
it is not surprising that, in this case, if f is in Ws,p then f belongs to L\r
q\r
for any q, as stated in the following two theorems.\r
Theorem 6.9. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp = n. Then\r
there exists a positive constant C = C(n, p, s) such that, for any measurable\r
and compactly supported function f : Rn → R, we have\r
kfkLq(Rn) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Rn), (6.30)\r
48

for any q ∈ [p, ∞); i.e., the space Ws,p(Rn\r
) is continuously embedded in\r
L\r
q\r
(Rn) for any q ∈ [p, ∞).\r
Theorem 6.10. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp = n. Let\r
Ω ⊆ Rnbe an extension domain for Ws,p. Then there exists a positive\r
constant C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that, for any f ∈ Ws,p(Ω), we have\r
kfkLq(Ω) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω), (6.31)\r
for any q ∈ [p, ∞); i.e., the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously embedded\r
in L\r
q\r
(Ω) for any q ∈ [p, ∞).\r
If, in addition, Ω is bounded, then the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously\r
embedded in L\r
q\r
(Ω) for any q ∈ [1, ∞).\r
The proofs can be obtained by simply combining Proposition 2.1 with\r
Theorem 6.5 and Theorem 6.7, respectively.\r
7. Compact embeddings\r
In this section, we state and prove some compactness results involving\r
the fractional spaces Ws,p(Ω) in bounded domains. The main proof is a\r
modification of the one of the classical Riesz-Frechet-Kolmogorov Theorem\r
(see [55, 79]) and, again, it is self-contained and it does not require to use\r
Besov or other interpolation spaces, nor Fourier transform and semigroup\r
flows (see [28, Theorem 1.5]). We refer to [77, Lemma 6.11] for the case\r
p = q = 2.\r
Theorem 7.1. Let s ∈ (0, 1), p ∈ [1, +∞), q ∈ [1, p], Ω ⊂ Rnbe a bounded\r
extension domain for Ws,p and T be a bounded subset of L\r
p\r
(Ω). Suppose\r
that\r

Z\r
Ω\r
Z\r
Ω\r
|f(x) − f(y)|\r
p\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
dx dy < +∞.\r
Then T is pre-compact in L\r
q\r
(Ω).\r
Proof. We want to show that T is totally bounded in L\r
q\r
(Ω), i.e., for any\r
ε ∈ (0, 1) there exist β1, . . . , βM ∈ L\r
q\r
(Ω) such that for any f ∈ T there\r
exists j ∈ {1, . . . , M} such that\r
kf − βjkLq(Ω) ≤ ε. (7.1)\r
49

Since Ω is an extension domain, there exists a function ˜f in Ws,p(Rn\r
)\r
such that k\r
˜fkWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω). Thus, for any cube Q containing Ω,\r
we have\r
k\r
˜fkWs,p(Q) ≤ k ˜fkWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω).\r
Observe that, since Q is a bounded open set, ˜f belongs also to L\r
q\r
(Q)\r
for any q ∈ [1, p]. Now, for any ε ∈ (0, 1), we let\r
Co := 1 + sup\r

and we take a collection of disjoints cubes Q1, . . . , QN of side ρ such that11\r
Ω ⊆ Q =\r

Qj.\r
For any x ∈ Ω, we define\r
j(x) as the unique integer in {1, . . . , N} for which x ∈ Qj(x). (7.2)\r
Also, for any f ∈ T , let\r
P(f)(x) := 1\r
|Qj(x)|\r
Z\r
Qj(x)\r
˜f(y) dy.\r
Notice that\r
P(f + g) = P(f) + P(g) for any f, g ∈ T\r
and that P(f) is constant, say equal to qj (f), in any Qj, for j ∈ {1, . . . , N}.\r
Therefore, we can define\r
R(f) := ρ\r
n/q\r
q1(f), . . . , qN (f)\r
\u0001\r
∈ R\r
N\r
11To be precise, for this one needs to take ε ∈ (0, 1) arbitrarily small and such that\r
the ration between the side of Q and ρε is integer.\r

that is, the set R(T ) is bounded in RN (with respect to the q-norm of\r
RN as well as to any equivalent norm of RN ) and so, since it is finite\r
dimensional, it is totally bounded. Therefore, there exist b1, . . . , bM ∈ RN\r
such that\r
R(T ) ⊆\r
[\r

where the balls Bη are taken in the q-norm of RN .\r
For any i ∈ {1, . . . , M}, we write the coordinates of bi as\r
bi = (bi,1, . . . , bi,N ) ∈ R\r
N .\r
For any x ∈ Ω, we set\r
βi(x) := ρ\r
−n/q bi,j(x)\r

where j(x) is as in (7.2).\r
Notice that βiis constant on Qj, i.e. if x ∈ Qj then\r
P(βi)(x) = ρ\r

q bi,j = βi(x) (7.5)\r
and so qj (βi) = ρ\r

Consequently, for any j ∈ {1, ..., M}, recalling (7.3) and (7.5)\r

This proves (7.1), as desired.\r
Corollary 7.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let\r
q ∈ [1, p⋆), Ω ⊆ Rnbe a bounded extension domain for Ws,p and T be a\r
bounded subset of L\r

Then T is pre-compact in L\r

(Ω).\r
Proof. First, note that for 1 ≤ q ≤ p the compactness follows from Theo\u0002rem 7.1.\r
53

For any q ∈ (p, p⋆\r
), we may take θ = θ(p, p⋆, q) ∈ (0, 1) such that\r
1/q = θ/p + 1 − θ/p⋆, thus for any f ∈ T and βj with j ∈ {1, ..., N} as in\r
the theorem above, using H¨older inequality with p/(θq) and p\r
⋆/((1 − θ)q),\r
we get\r

where the last inequalities comes directly from (7.11) and the continuos\r
embedding (see Theorem 6.7).\r
Remark 7.3. As well known in the classical case s = 1 (and, more generally,\r
when s is an integer), also in the fractional case the lack of compactness\r
for the critical embedding (q = p\r
⋆\r
) is not surprising, because of translation\r
and dilation invariance (see [76] for various results in this direction, for any\r
0 < s < n/2).\r
Notice that the regularity assumption on Ω in Theorem 7.1 and Corol\u0002lary 7.2 cannot be dropped (see Example 9.2 in Section 9).\r
8. H¨older regularity\r
In this section we will show certain regularity properties for functions\r
in Ws,p(Ω) when sp > n and Ω is an extension domain for Ws,p with no\r
external cusps. For instance, one may take Ω any Lipschitz domain (recall\r
Theorem 5.4).\r
The main result is stated in the forthcoming Theorem 8.2. First, we\r
need a simple technical lemma, whose proof can be found in [46] (for\r
instance).\r
54

Lemma 8.1. ([46, Lemma 2.2]). Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and sp ∈ (n, n + p].\r
Let Ω ⊂ Rnbe a domain with no external cusps and f be a function in\r
Ws,p(Ω). Then, for any x0 ∈ Ω and R, R′, with 0 < R′ < R < diam(Ω), we\r
have\r
|hfiBR(x0)∩Ω − hfiBR′ (x0)∩Ω| ≤ c [f]p,sp |BR(x0) ∩ Ω|\r

Theorem 8.2. Let Ω ⊆ Rnbe an extension domain for Ws,p with no\r
external cusps and let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) such that sp > n. Then, there\r
exists C > 0, depending on n, s, p and Ω, such that\r

for any f ∈ L\r
p\r
(Ω), with α := (sp − n)/p.\r
Proof. In the following, we will denote by C suitable positive quantities,\r
possibly different from line to line, and possibly depending on p and s.\r
First, we notice that if the right hand side of (8.2) is not finite, then\r
we are done. Thus, we may suppose that\r
Z\r

Z\r
Ω\r
|f(x) − f(y)|\r

n+sp\r
dx dy ≤ C,\r
for some C > 0.\r
Second, since Ω is an extension domain for Ws,p, we can extend any f\r
to a function ˜f such that k\r
˜fkWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω).\r
Now, for any bounded measurable set U ⊂ Rn, we consider the average\r
value of the function ˜f in U, given by\r
h\r
˜fiU :=\r

Now, we will show that f is a continuos function. Taking into account\r
(8.1), it follows that the sequence of functions x → hfiBR(x)∩Ω converges\r
uniformly in x ∈ Ω when R → 0. In particular the limit function g will be\r
continuos and the same holds for f, since by Lebesgue theorem we have\r
that\r

Z\r
BR(x)∩Ω\r
f(y) dy = f(x) for almost every x ∈ Ω.\r
Now, take any x, y ∈ Ω and set R = |x − y|. We have\r
|f(x) − f(y)| ≤ |f(x) − h ˜fiB2R(x)\r
| + |h ˜fiB2R(x) − h ˜fiB2R(y)| + |h ˜fiB2R(y) − f(y)|\r
56

We can estimate the first and the third term of right hand-side of the\r
above inequality using Lemma 8.1. Indeed, getting the limit in (8.1) as\r
R′ → 0 and writing 2R instead of R, for any x ∈ Ω we get\r
|h ˜fiB2R(x) − f(x)| ≤ c [f]p,sp|B2R(x)|\r
(sp−n)/np ≤ C[f]p,sp R(sp−n)/p (8.5)\r
where the constant C is given by c 2\r
(sp−n)/p/|B1|.\r
On the other hand,\r
|h ˜fiB2R(x) − h ˜fiB2R(y)| ≤ |f(z) − h ˜fiB2R(x)| + |\r
˜f(z) − h ˜fiB2R(y)\r
|\r
and so, integrating on z ∈ B2R(x) ∩ B2R(y), we have\r
|B2R(x) ∩ B2R(y)| |h ˜fiB2R(x) − h ˜fiB2R(y)|\r

Furthermore, since BR(x) ∪ BR(y) ⊂\r

\u0001\r
, we have\r
|BR(x)| ≤ |B2R(x) ∩ B2R(y)| and |BR(y)| ≤ |B2R(x) ∩ B2R(y)|\r

Combining (8.5), (8.6) with (8.7) it follows\r
|f(x) − f(y)| ≤ C [f]p,sp |x − y|\r
(sp−n)/p\r
, (8.8)\r
up to relabeling the constant C.\r
Therefore, by taking into account (8.4), we can conclude that f ∈\r
C\r
0,α(Ω), with α = (sp − n)/p.\r
Finally, taking R0 < diam(Ω) (note that the latter can be possibly\r
infinity), using estimate in (8.5) and the H¨older inequality we have, for\r
any x ∈ Ω,\r
|f(x)| ≤ |h ˜fiBR0\r

for a suitable positive constant C.\r

Remark 8.3. The estimate in (8.3) says that f belongs to the Campanato\r
space L p,λ, with λ := sp, (see [22] and, e.g., [46, Definition 2.4]). Then,\r
the conclusion in the proof of Theorem 8.2 is actually an application of the\r
Campanato Isomorphism (see, for instance, [46, Theorem 2.9]).\r
Just for a matter of curiosity, we observe that, according to the def\u0002inition (2.1), the fractional Sobolev space Ws,∞(Ω) could be view as the\r
space of functions\r
\u001A\r
u ∈ L\r
∞(Ω) : |u(x) − u(y)|\r
|x − y|\r
s\r
∈ L\r
∞(Ω × Ω)\u001B\r
,\r
but this space just boils down to C\r
0,s(Ω), that is consistent with the\r
H¨older embedding proved in this section; i.e., taking formally p = ∞\r
in Theorem 8.2, the function u belongs to C\r
0,s(Ω).\r
9. Some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains\r
When the domain Ω is not Lipschitz, some interesting things happen,\r
as next examples show.\r
Example 9.1. Let s ∈ (0, 1). We will construct a function u in W1,p(Ω) that\r
does not belong to Ws,p(Ω), providing a counterexample to Proposition 2.2\r
when the domain is not Lipschitz.\r
Take any\r
p ∈ (1/s, +∞). (9.1)\r
Due to (9.1), we can fix\r
κ >\r
p + 1\r
sp − 1\r
. (9.2)\r
We remark that κ > 1.\r
Let us consider the cusp in the plane\r
C := \b(x1, x2) with x1 ≤ 0 and |x2| ≤ |x1|\r
κ\r
\t\r
and take polar coordinates on R2 \\ C, say ρ = ρ(x) ∈ (0, +∞) and θ =\r
θ(x) ∈ (−π, π), with x = (x1, x2) ∈ R2 \\ C.\r
59

We define the function u(x) := ρ(x)θ(x) and the heart-shaped do\u0002main Ω := (R2 \\ C) ∩ B1, with B1 being the unit ball centered in the\r
origin. Then, u ∈ W1,p(Ω) \\ Ws,p(Ω).\r
To check this, we observe that\r
∂x1ρ = (2ρ)\r
−1\r
∂x1ρ\r
2 = (2ρ)−1\r
∂x1(x\r
2\r
1 + x\r
2\r
2\r
) = x1\r
ρ\r
and, in the same way,\r
∂x2 ρ =\r
x2\r
ρ\r
.\r
Accordingly,\r
1 = ∂x1 x1 = ∂x1(ρ cos θ) = ∂x1 ρ cos θ − ρ sin θ∂x1θ =\r
x\r
2\r
1\r
ρ\r
2\r
− x2∂x1θ\r
= 1 −\r
x\r
2\r
2\r
ρ\r
2\r
− x2∂x1θ.\r
That is\r
∂x1θ = −\r
x2\r
ρ\r
2\r
.\r
By exchanging the roles of x1 and x2 (with some care on the sign of the\r
derivatives of the trigonometric functions), one also obtains\r
∂x2θ =\r
x1\r
ρ\r
2\r
.\r
Therefore,\r
∂x1 u = ρ\r
−1\r
(x1θ − x2) and ∂x2 u = ρ\r
−1\r
(x2θ + x1)\r
and so\r
|∇u|\r
2 = θ2 + 1 ≤ π2 + 1.\r
This shows that u ∈ W1,p(Ω).\r
On the other hand, let us fix r ∈ (0, 1), to be taken arbitrarily small\r
at the end, and let us define r0 := r and, for any j ∈ N, rj+1 := rj − r\r
κ\r
j\r
.\r
By induction, one sees that rjis strictly decreasing, that rj > 0 and\r
so rj ∈ (0, r) ⊂ (0, 1). Accordingly, we can define\r
ℓ := lim\r
j→+∞\r
rj ∈ [0, 1].\r
60

By construction\r
ℓ = lim\r
j→+∞\r
rj+1 = lim\r

We define\r
Dj:= \b(x, y) ∈ R\r

s.t. x1, y1 ∈ (−rj, −rj+1),\r
x2 ∈ (|x1|\r
κ\r

κ\r
) and − y2 ∈ (|y1|\r
κ\r

κ\r
)\r
\t\r
.\r
We observe that\r
Ω × Ω ⊇\r
\b\r
(x, y) ∈ R\r
2 × R2\r
s.t. x1, y1 ∈ (−r, 0),\r
x2 ∈ (|x1|\r

κ−1\r
j\r
) ≥ rj (1 − r\r
κ−1\r
) ≥\r
rj\r
2\r
,\r
for small r. Hence, if (x, y) ∈ Dj,\r
|x1| ≤ rj ≤ 2rj+1 ≤ 2|y1|\r
and, analogously,\r
|y1| ≤ 2|x1|.\r
Moreover, if (x, y) ∈ Dj,\r
|x1 − y1| ≤ rj − rj+1 = r\r
κ\r
j ≤ 2\r
κ\r

κ\r
j+1 ≤ 2\r

.\r
61

As a consequence, if (x, y) ∈ Dj\r
,\r
|x − y| ≤ 2\r
κ+3|x1|κ\r
.\r
Notice also that, when (x, y) ∈ Dj, we have θ(x) ≥ π/2 and θ(y) ≤ −π/2,\r

Example 9.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1). We will construct a sequence of functions\r
{fn} bounded in Ws,p(Ω) that does not admit any convergent subsequence\r
in L\r
q\r
(Ω), providing a counterexample to Theorem 7.1 when the domain is\r
not Lipschitz.\r
We follow an observation by [82]. For the sake of simplicity, fix n =\r
p = q = 2. We take ak := 1/Ckfor a constant C > 10 and we consider the\r
set Ω = S∞\r
k=1 Bk where, for any k ∈ N, Bk denotes the ball of radius a\r
2\r
k\r
centered in ak. Notice that\r
ak → 0 as k → ∞ and ak − a\r
2\r
k > ak+1 + a\r
2\r
k+1.\r
Thus, Ω is the union of disjoint balls, it is bounded and it is not a Lipschitz\r
domain.\r
For any n ∈ N, we define the function fn : Ω → R as follows\r
fn(x) = (\r
π\r
−\r
1\r
2 a\r
−2\r
n x ∈ Bn,\r
0 x ∈ Ω \\ Bn .\r
We observe that we cannot extract any subsequence convergent in L\r
2\r
(Ω)\r
from the sequence of functions {fn}, because fn(x) → 0 as n → +∞, for\r
any fixed x ∈ Ω but\r

Thus, since x ∈ Bn, y ∈ Bk, it follows\r
|x − y| ≥ |an − a\r

Abstract\r
This paper deals with the fractional Sobolev spaces Ws,p. We analyze the\r
relations among some of their possible definitions and their role in the trace\r
theory. We prove continuous and compact embeddings, investigating the\r
problem of the extension domains and other regularity results.\r
Most of the results we present here are probably well known to the ex\u0002perts, but we believe that our proofs are original and we do not make use\r
of any interpolation techniques nor pass through the theory of Besov spaces.\r
We also present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz domains.\r

These pages are for students and young researchers of all ages who\r
may like to hitchhike their way from 1 to s ∈ (0, 1). To wit, for anybody\r
who, only endowed with some basic undergraduate analysis course (and\r
knowing where his towel is), would like to pick up some quick, crash and\r
essentially self-contained information on the fractional Sobolev spaces Ws,p.\r
The reasons for such a hitchhiker to start this adventurous trip might\r
be of different kind: (s)he could be driven by mathematical curiosity,\r
or could be tempted by the many applications that fractional calculus\r
seems to have recently experienced. In a sense, fractional Sobolev spaces\r
have been a classical topic in functional and harmonic analysis all along,\r
and some important books, such as [59, 90] treat the topic in detail.\r
On the other hand, fractional spaces, and the corresponding nonlocal\r
2

equations, are now experiencing impressive applications in different sub\u0002jects, such as, among others, the thin obstacle problem [87, 69], opti\u0002mization [37], finance [26], phase transitions [2, 14, 88, 40, 45], stratified\r
materials [83, 23, 24], anomalous diffusion [68, 98, 65], crystal disloca\u0002tion [92, 47, 8], soft thin films [57], semipermeable membranes and flame\r
propagation [15], conservation laws [9], ultra-relativistic limits of quan\u0002tum mechanics [41], quasi-geostrophic flows [64, 27, 21], multiple scatter\u0002ing [36, 25, 50], minimal surfaces [16, 20], materials science [4], water\r
waves [81, 100, 99, 32, 29, 74, 33, 34, 31, 30, 42, 51, 75, 35], elliptic\r
problems with measure data [71, 54], non-uniformly elliptic problems [39],\r
gradient potential theory [72] and singular set of minima of variational\r
functionals [70, 56]. Don’t panic, instead, see also [86, 87] for further\r
motivation.\r
For these reasons, we thought that it could be of some interest to write\r
down these notes – or, more frankly, we wrote them just because if you\r
really want to understand something, the best way is to try and\r
explain it to someone else.\r
Some words may be needed to clarify the style of these pages have been\r
gathered. We made the effort of making a rigorous exposition, starting from\r
scratch, trying to use the least amount of technology and with the simplest,\r
low-profile language we could use – since capital letters were always\r
the best way of dealing with things you didn’t have a good answer\r
to.\r
Differently from many other references, we make no use of Besov spaces4\r
or interpolation techniques, in order to make the arguments as elementary\r
as possible and the exposition suitable for everybody, since when you are\r
a student or whatever, and you can’t afford a car, or a plane fare,\r
or even a train fare, all you can do is hope that someone will stop\r
and pick you up, and it’s nice to think that one could, even here\r
and now, be whisked away just by hitchhiking.\r
Of course, by dropping fine technologies and powerful tools, we will miss\r
several very important features, and we apologize for this. So, we highly\r
4About this, we would like to quote [53], according to which “The paradox of Besov\r
spaces is that the very thing that makes them so successful also makes them very\r
difficult to present and to learn”.\r
3

recommend all the excellent, classical books on the topic, such as [59, 90, 1,\r
93, 94, 101, 80, 91, 67, 60], and the many references given therein. Without\r
them, our reader would remain just a hitchhiker, losing the opportunity of\r
performing the next crucial step towards a full mastering of the subject\r
and becoming the captain of a spaceship.\r
In fact, compared to other Guides, this one is not definitive, and it\r
is a very evenly edited book and contains many passages that simply\r
seemed to its editors a good idea at the time. In any case, of course,\r
we know that we cannot solve any major problems just with potatoes\r
– it’s fun to try and see how far one can get though.\r
In this sense, while most of the results we present here are probably well\r
known to the experts, we believe that the exposition is somewhat original.\r
These are the topics we cover. In Section 2, we define the fractional\r
Sobolev spaces Ws,p via the Gagliardo approach and we investigate some\r
of their basic properties. In Section 3 we focus on the Hilbert case p = 2,\r
dealing with its relation with the fractional Laplacian, and letting the\r
principal value integral definition interplay with the definition in the Fourier\r
space. Then, in Section 4 we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the\r
constant factor that appears in the definition of the fractional Laplacian.\r
Section 5 is devoted to the extension problem of a function in Ws,p(Ω)\r
to Ws,p(Rn): technically, this is slightly more complicated than the classi\u0002cal analogue for integer Sobolev spaces, since the extension interacts with\r
the values taken by the function in Ω via the Gagliardo norm and the\r
computations have to take care of it.\r
Sobolev inequalities and continuous embeddings are dealt with in Sec\u0002tion 6, while Section 7 is devoted to compact embeddings. Then, in Sec\u0002tion 8, we point out that functions in Ws,p are continuous when sp is large\r
enough.\r
In Section 9, we present some counterexamples in non-Lipschitz do\u0002mains.\r
After that, we hope that our hitchhiker reader has enjoyed his trip from\r
the integer Sobolev spaces to the fractional ones, with the advantages\r
of being able to get more quickly from one place to another -\r
particularly when the place you arrived at had probably become, as\r
a result of this, very similar to the place you had left.\r

No prerequisite is needed. We just recall the definition of the Fourier\r

Let Ω be a general, possibly non smooth, open set in Rn. For any real\r
s > 0 and for any p ∈ [1, ∞), we want to define the fractional Sobolev\r
spaces Ws,p(Ω). In the literature, fractional Sobolev-type spaces are also\r
called Aronszajn, Gagliardo or Slobodeckij spaces, by the name of the ones\r
who introduced them, almost simultaneously (see [3, 44, 89]).\r
We start by fixing the fractional exponent s in (0, 1). For any p ∈\r
[1, +∞), we define Ws,p(Ω) as follows\r
Ws,p(Ω) := (u ∈ L\r

completely dropped (see Example 9.1 in Section 9); we also refer to the\r
forthcoming Section 5, in which we discuss the extension problem in Ws,p\r

Let us come back to the definition of the space Ws,p(Ω). Before going\r
ahead, it is worth explaining why the definition in (2.1) cannot be plainly\r
extended to the case s ≥ 1. Suppose that Ω is a connected open set in Rn,\r

When s > 1 and it is not an integer we write s = m + σ, where m\r
is an integer and σ ∈ (0, 1). In this case the space Ws,p(Ω) consists of\r
those equivalence classes of functions u ∈ W m,p(Ω) whose distributional\r
derivatives Dαu, with |α| = m, belong to Wσ,p(Ω), namely\r

5For the sake of simplicity, in the definition of the fractional Sobolev spaces and those\r
of the corresponding norms in (2.1) and (2.2) we avoided any normalization constant.\r
In view of (2.8) and (2.9), it is worthing notice that, in order to recover the classical\r
W1,p and L\r
p\r
spaces, one may consider to add a factor C(n, p, s) ≈ s(1 − s) in front of\r
the double integral in (2.2).\r

Clearly, if s = m is an integer, the space Ws,p(Ω) coincides with the Sobolev\r
space W m,p(Ω).\r
Corollary 2.3. Let p ∈ [1, +∞) and s, s′ > 1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn\r
of class C\r
0,1\r
. Then, if s\r
′ ≥ s, we have\r
Ws\r

,p(Ω) ⊆ Ws,p(Ω).\r
Proof. We write s = k + σ and s\r
′ = k′ + σ′\r
, with k, k′integers and σ, σ′ ∈\r
(0, 1). In the case k\r
′ = k, we can use Proposition 2.1 in order to conclude\r
that Ws\r
′\r
,p(Ω) is continuously embedded in Ws,p(Ω). On the other hand, if\r
k\r

chain\r
Wk\r

,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk\r

,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk+1,p(Ω) ⊆ Wk+σ,p(Ω).\r
The proof is complete.\r
As in the classic case with s being an integer, any function in the\r
fractional Sobolev space Ws,p(Rn) can be approximated by a sequence of\r
smooth functions with compact support.\r
Theorem 2.4. For any s > 0, the space C\r
∞\r
0\r
(Rn) of smooth functions with\r
compact support is dense in Ws,p(Rn).\r

Now, we take into account an alternative definition of the space Hs(Rn) =\r
Ws,2(Rn) via the Fourier transform. Precisely, we may define\r
Hˆ s(R\r
n\r
) = \u001Au ∈ L\r
2\r
(R\r
n\r
) : Z\r
Rn\r
(1 + |ξ|\r
2s\r
)|Fu(ξ)|\r
2\r
dξ < +∞\r
\u001B\r
(3.7)\r
and we observe that the above definition, unlike the ones via the Gagliardo\r
norm in (2.2), is valid also for any real s ≥ 1.\r
We may also use an analogous definition for the case s < 0 by setting\r
Hˆ s(R\r
n\r
) = \u001Au ∈ S ′(R\r
n\r
) : Z\r

2\r

|Fu(ξ)|\r
2\r
dξ < +∞\r
\u001B\r

although in this case the space Hˆ s\r
(Rn) is not a subset of L\r
2\r
(Rn) and, in\r
order to use the Fourier transform, one has to start from an element of\r
S ′(Rn), (see also Remark 2.5).\r
The equivalence of the space Hˆ s(Rn) defined in (3.7) with the one\r
defined in the previous section via the Gagliardo norm (see (2.1)) is stated\r
and proven in the forthcoming Proposition 3.4.\r
First, we will prove that the fractional Laplacian (−∆)scan be viewed\r
as a pseudo-differential operator of symbol |ξ|\r
2s\r
. The proof is standard and\r
it can be found in many papers (see, for instance, [91, Chapter 16]). We\r
will follow the one in [97] (see Section 3), in which is shown how singular\r
integrals naturally arise as a continuous limit of discrete long jump random\r
walks.\r
Proposition 3.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let (−∆)s: S → L\r
2\r
(Rn) be the\r
fractional Laplacian operator defined by (3.1). Then, for any u ∈ S ,\r
(−∆)su = F−1(|ξ|\r
2s\r
(Fu)) ∀ξ ∈ R\r
n\r
. (3.8)\r
Proof. In view of Lemma 3.2, we may use the definition via the weighted\r
second order differential quotient in (3.3). We denote by L u the integral\r
in (3.3), that is\r
L u(x) = −\r

L is a linear operator and we are looking for its “symbol” (or “multiplier”),\r
that is a function S : Rn → R such that\r
L u = F−1(S(Fu)). (3.9)\r
We want to prove that\r

Consequently, by the Fubini-Tonelli’s Theorem, we can exchange the in\u0002tegral in y with the Fourier transform in x. Thus, we apply the Fourier\r
transform in the variable x in (3.9) and we obtain\r

We have that I is rotationally invariant, that is\r
I(ξ) = I(|ξ|e1), (3.14)\r
where e1 denotes the first direction vector in Rn. Indeed, when n = 1,\r
then we can deduce (3.14) by the fact that I(−ξ) = I(ξ). When n ≥ 2,\r
15

we consider a rotation R for which R(|ξ|e1) = ξ and we denote by RT\r

Remark 3.5. The equivalence of the spaces Hs and Hˆ sstated in Proposi\u0002tion 3.4 relies on Plancherel Formula. As well known, unless p = q = 2,\r
one cannot go forward and backward between an L\r
p and an Lq via Fourier\r
transform (see, for instance, the sharp inequality in [5] for the case 1 <\r
p < 2 and q equal to the conjugate exponent p/(p − 1) ). That is why the\r
general fractional space defined via Fourier transform for 1 < p < ∞ and\r
s > 0, say Hs,p(Rn), does not coincide with the fractional Sobolev spaces\r
Ws,p(Rn) and will be not discussed here (see, e.g., [101]).\r
Finally, we are able to prove the relation between the fractional Lapla\u0002cian operator (−∆)s and the fractional Sobolev space Hs\r

To prove this, let us denote by ̟n the Lebesgue measure of the n\u0002dimensional unit ball and let us fix the notation x = (˜x, x′\r

As well known when s is an integer, under certain regularity assump\u0002tions on the domain Ω, any function in Ws,p(Ω) may be extended to a\r
function in Ws,p(Rn). Extension results are quite important in applica\u0002tions and are necessary in order to improve some embeddings theorems, in\r
the classic case as well as in the fractional case (see Section 6 and Section 7\r
in the following).\r
For any s ∈ (0, 1) and any p ∈ [1, ∞), we say that an open set Ω ⊆\r
Rnis an extension domain for Ws,p if there exists a positive constant\r
C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that: for every function u ∈ Ws,p(Ω) there exists\r
u˜ ∈ Ws,p(Rn) with ˜u(x) = u(x) for all x ∈ Ω and ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω).\r
In general, an arbitrary open set is not an extension domain for Ws,p.\r
To the authors’ knowledge, the problem of characterizing the class of sets\r
that are extension domains for Ws,p is open9\r
. When s is an integer, we\r
cite [58] for a complete characterization in the special case s = 1, p = 2 and\r
n = 2, and we refer the interested reader to the recent book by Leoni [60],\r
in which this problem is very well discussed (see, in particular, Chapter 11\r
and Chapter 12 there).\r
In this section, we will show that any open set Ω of class C\r
0,1 with\r
bounded boundary is an extension domain for Ws,p.\r
We start with some preliminary lemmas, in which we will construct the\r
extension to the whole of Rnof a function u defined on Ω in two separated\r
cases: when the function u is identically zero in a neighborhood of the\r
boundary ∂Ω and when Ω coincides with the half-space Rn\r
+.\r
Lemma 5.1. Let Ω be an open set in Rn and u a function in Ws,p(Ω) with\r
s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞). If there exists a compact subset K ⊂ Ω such\r
that u ≡ 0 in Ω \\ K, then the extension function u˜ defined as\r

Now, we are ready to prove the main theorem of this section, that states\r
that every open Lipschitz set Ω with bounded boundary is an extension\r
domain for Ws,p.\r
Theorem 5.4. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and Ω ⊆ Rnbe an open set of\r
class C\r
0,1 with bounded boundary10. Then Ws,p(Ω) is continuously embedded\r
in Ws,p(Rn), namely for any u ∈ Ws,p(Ω) there exists u˜ ∈ Ws,p(Rn) such\r
that u˜|Ω = u and\r
ku˜kWs,p(Rn) ≤ CkukWs,p(Ω)\r
where C = C(n, p, s, Ω).\r
Proof. Since ∂Ω is compact, we can find a finite number of balls Bj such\r

ψg0 u(x) = (\r

kψg0 ukWs,p(Rn) ≤ C kψ0 ukWs,p(Ω) ≤ C kukWs,p(Ω), (5.9)\r

Since Tjis bi-Lipschitz, by arguing as above it follows that wj ∈\r

By definition ψj wj has compact support in Bj and therefore, as done for\r
ψ0 u, we can consider the extension ψ]j wj to all Rnin such a way that\r
ψ]j wj ∈ Ws,p(Rn). Also, using Lemma 5.1, Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.3 and\r

when p = 2 and s ∈ [1/2, 1) some of the statements may be strengthened\r
(see [10]). We also note that more general embeddings for the spaces Ws,p\r
can be obtained by interpolation techniques and by passing through Besov\r
spaces; see, for instance, [6, 7, 95, 96, 63]. For a more comprehensive\r
treatment of fractional Sobolev-type inequalities we refer to [61, 62, 12, 1,\r
91] and the references therein.\r
We remark that the proof here is self-contained. Moreover, we will not\r
make use of Besov or fancy interpolation spaces.\r
In order to prove the Sobolev-type inequality in forthcoming Theo\u0002rem 6.5, we need some preliminary results. The first of them is an el\u0002ementary estimate involving the measure of finite measurable sets E in\r
Rn as stated in the following lemma (see [85, Lemma A.1] and also [20,\r
Corollary 24 and 25]).\r
Lemma 6.1. Fix x ∈ Rn. Let p ∈ [1, +∞), s ∈ (0, 1) and E ⊂ Rnbe a\r
measurable set with finite measure. Then,\r

dy\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
≥ C |E|\r
−sp/n\r
,\r
for a suitable constant C = C(n, p, s) > 0.\r
Proof. We set\r
ρ := \u0012\r
|E|\r
ωn\r
\u00131\r
n\r
and then it follows\r
|(C E) ∩ Bρ(x)| = |Bρ(x)| − |E ∩ Bρ(x)| = |E| − |E ∩ Bρ(x)|\r
= |E ∩ C Bρ(x)|."""

Now, we recall a general statement about a useful summability property\r
(see [84, Lemma 5]. For related results, see also [38, Lemma 4]).\r
Lemma 6.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Fix T > 1;\r

So, recalling (6.2), we obtain the desired result.\r
We use the above tools to deal with the measure theoretic properties\r
of the level sets of the functions (see [84, Lemma 6]).\r
Lemma 6.3. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let\r
f ∈ L\r

Proof. Notice that\r
\f\r
\f\r
|f(x)| − |f(y)|\r
\f\r
\f ≤ |f(x) − f(y)|,\r
and so, by possibly replacing f with |f|, we may consider the case in\r
which f ≥ 0.\r
We define\r
Ak := {|f| > 2\r
k\r
}. (6.5)\r
We remark that Ak+1 ⊆ Ak, hence\r
ak+1 ≤ ak. (6.6)\r
We define\r
Dk := Ak \\ Ak+1 = {2\r
k < f ≤ 2k+1} and dk := |Dk|.\r
Notice that\r
dk and ak are bounded and they become zero when k is large enough,\r
(6.7)\r
thanks to (6.3). Also, we observe that the Dk’s are disjoint, that\r

Lemma 6.4. Let q ∈ [1, ∞). Let f : Rn → R be a measurable function.\r

Then\r
lim\r

kfN kLq(Rn) = kfkLq(Rn).\r
Proof. We denote by |f|N the function obtained by cutting |f| at level N.\r
We have that |f|N = |fN | and so, by Fatou Lemma, we obtain that\r

any x ∈ Rn.\r

Taking into account the previous lemmas, we are able to give an elemen\u0002tary proof of the Sobolev-type inequality stated in the following theorem.\r
Theorem 6.5. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Then\r
there exists a positive constant C = C(n, p, s) such that, for any measurable\r
and compactly supported function f : Rn → R, we have\r

dx dy. (6.21)\r
where p\r
⋆ = p⋆\r
(n, s) is the so-called “fractional critical exponent” and it is\r
equal to np/(n − sp).\r
Consequently, the space Ws,p(Rn) is continuously embedded in L\r
q\r
(Rn)\r
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆].\r
Proof. First, we note that if the right hand side of (6.21) is unbounded\r
then the claim in the theorem plainly follows. Thus, we may suppose that\r
f is such that\r
Z\r
Rn\r
Z\r
Rn\r
|f(x) − f(y)|\r
p\r
|x − y|\r
n+sp\r
dx dy < +∞. (6.22)\r
Moreover, we can suppose, without loss of generality, that\r
f ∈ L\r
∞(Rn\r
). (6.23)\r
Indeed, if (6.22) holds for bounded functions, then it holds also for the\r
function fN , obtained by any (possibly unbounded) f by cutting at levels\r
−N and +N (see (6.20)). Therefore, by Lemma 6.4 and the fact that (6.22)\r
together with the Dominated Convergence Theorem imply\r

for a suitable constant C depending on n, p and s.\r
Finally, it suffices to apply Lemma 6.3 and we obtain the desired result,\r
up to relabeling the constant C in (6.25).\r
Furthermore, the embedding for q ∈ (p, p⋆) follows from standard applica\u0002tion of H¨older inequality.\r
Remark 6.6. From Lemma 6.1, it follows that\r

for all measurable sets E with finite measure.\r
On the other hand, we see that (6.21) reduces to (6.26) when f = χE,\r
so (6.26) (and thus Lemma 6.1) may be seen as a Sobolev-type inequality\r
for sets.\r
The above embedding does not generally hold for the space Ws,p(Ω)\r
since it not always possible to extend a function f ∈ Ws,p(Ω) to a function\r
˜f ∈ Ws,p(Rn\r
). In order to be allowed to do that, we should require further\r
regularity assumptions on Ω (see Section 5).\r
Theorem 6.7. Let s ∈ (0, 1) and p ∈ [1, +∞) such that sp < n. Let\r
Ω ⊆ Rnbe an extension domain for Ws,p. Then there exists a positive\r
constant C = C(n, p, s, Ω) such that, for any f ∈ Ws,p(Ω), we have\r
kfkLq(Ω) ≤ CkfkWs,p(Ω), (6.27)\r
47

for any q ∈ [p, p⋆\r
]; i.e., the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously embedded in L\r
q\r
(Ω)\r
for any q ∈ [p, p⋆].\r
If, in addition, Ω is bounded, then the space Ws,p(Ω) is continuously\r
embedded in L\r
q\r
(Ω) for any q ∈ [1, p⋆].\r
Proof. Let f ∈ Ws,p(Ω). Since Ω ⊆ Rnis an extension domain for Ws,p,\r
then there exists a constant C1 = C1(n, p, s, Ω) > 0 such that\r
k\r
˜fkWs,p(Rn) ≤ C1kfkWs,p(Ω), (6.28)\r
with ˜f such that ˜f(x) = f(x) for x a.e. in Ω.\r
On the other hand, by Theorem 6.5, the space Ws,p(Rn\r
) is continuously\r
embedded in L\r
q\r
(Rn) for any q ∈ [p, p⋆]; i.e., there exists a constant C2 =\r
C2(n, p, s) > 0 such that\r
k\r
˜fkLq(Rn) ≤ C2k˜fkWs,p(Rn)\r
. (6.29)\r

Example 9.2. Let s ∈ (0, 1). We will construct a sequence of functions\r

We follow an observation by [82]. For the sake of simplicity, fix n =\r
p = q = 2. We take ak := 1/Ckfor a constant C > 10 and we consider the\r
set Ω = S∞\r
k=1 Bk where, for any k ∈ N, Bk denotes the ball of radius a\r
