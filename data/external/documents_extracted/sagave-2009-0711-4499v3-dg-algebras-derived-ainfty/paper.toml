DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS\r
STEFFEN SAGAVE\r
Abstract. A differential graded algebra can be viewed as an A∞-algebra. By\r
a theorem of Kadeishvili, a dga over a field admits a quasi-isomorphism from\r
a minimal A∞-algebra. We introduce the notion of a derived A∞-algebra and\r
show that any dga A over an arbitrary commutative ground ring k is equivalent\r
to a minimal derived A∞-algebra. Such a minimal derived A∞-algebra model\r
for A is a k-projective resolution of the homology algebra of A together with\r
a family of maps satisfying appropriate relations.\r
As in the case of A∞-algebras, it is possible to recover the dga up to quasi\u0002isomorphism from a minimal derived A∞-algebra model. Hence the structure\r
we are describing provides a complete description of the quasi-isomorphism\r
type of the dga.\r
1. Introduction\r
An A∞-algebra over a commutative ring k is a Z-graded k-module A with struc\u0002ture maps mj : A⊗j → A[2 − j] satisfying certain relations. A∞-algebras were\r
introduced by Stasheff in the 1960’s [21]. We refer to Keller’s survey [13] for back\u0002ground and for references to the various applications A∞-algebras have found in\r
different fields of mathematics.\r
A differential graded algebra over k is an A∞-algebra with m1 the differential,\r
m2 the multiplication, and mj = 0 for j ≥ 3. If k is a field, a theorem of Kadeishvili\r
[11] asserts that every k-dga A admits a quasi-isomorphism of A∞-algebras from\r
a minimal A∞-algebra, where minimal means m1 = 0. The underlying graded\r
k-algebra of such a minimal model for A is the homology algebra H∗(A). The\r
quasi-isomorphism type of A can be recovered from its minimal model. There\u0002fore, minimal A∞-algebras provide an alternative description for quasi-isomorphism\r
classes of dgas [13, §3.3], and the minimal A∞-structure on H∗(A) specifies pre\u0002cisely the additional information needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type\r
of a dga from its homology [13, §2.1].\r
From now on let k be a commutative ring. Then the conclusion of Kadeishvili’s\r
theorem will in general not hold if the homology H∗(A) is not k-projective since\r
for example a k-linear cycle selection morphism may not exist.\r
The aim of the present paper is to generalize the notion of an A∞-algebra to\r
a context in which a dga A admits a minimal model without restrictions on k or\r
H∗(A), and thereby to provide a different description of the quasi-isomorphism type\r
of A.\r
Our approach is motivated by the following two observations. On the one hand,\r
A∞-algebras are closely related to Hochschild cohomology. For example, the m3\r
of the minimal A∞-structure on H∗(A) is a cocycle in the Hochschild complex of\r
H∗(A) whose cohomology class encodes relevant information about A; see [2]. On\r
the other hand, Hochschild cohomology is for many purposes the ‘wrong’ cohomol\u0002ogy theory if we apply it to k-algebras which are not k-projective. In this case,\r

one should rather consider the derived Hochschild cohomology, which is also known\r
as Shukla cohomology. Following Baues and Pirashvili [1], the latter cohomology\r
theory can be defined as the Hochschild cohomology of a k-projective dga resolving\r
the algebra.\r
Our strategy for finding minimal models in the general context is therefore to\r
first take a k-projective resolution of H∗(A) in the direction of a new grading, and\r
then to look for the analog to the minimal A∞-structure on this bigraded k-module.\r
To take the additional grading into account, we introduce the notion of a derived\r
A∞-algebra (dA∞-algebra for short). A dA∞-algebra is a (N, Z)-bigraded k-module\r
E with structure maps mE\r
ij : E⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] for i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 1 satisfying\r
appropriate relations. It is minimal if mE\r
01 = 0. Both dgas and A∞-algebras can\r
be considered as dA∞-algebras concentrated in degree 0 of the N-grading. The\r
notion of equivalence suitable for our purposes is that of an E2-equivalence of\r
dA∞-algebras, which is detected on the iterated homology with respect to mE\r
01 and\r
mE\r
11.\r
Theorem 1.1. Let A be a differential graded algebra over a commutative ring k.\r
There exists a k-projective minimal dA∞-algebra E together with an E2-equivalence\r
E → A of dA∞-algebras. This minimal dA∞-algebra model E of A is well defined\r
up to E2-equivalences between k-projective minimal dA∞-algebras. Particularly, the\r
bigraded k-module E together with the differential mE\r
11 and the multiplication mE\r
02\r
is a k-projective resolution of the graded k-algebra H∗(A).\r
The first step in the proof of the theorem is to construct a dA∞-algebra B with\r
mB\r
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3 together with a map B → A of dA∞-algebras such that the\r
induced map H∗(B, mB\r
01) → H∗(A) is a k-projective resolution. To find such a\r
B, we employ the cofibrant replacement in a resolution model category structure\r
on the category of simplicial dgas. The second step is to replace B by a minimal\r
dA∞-algebra, which is now possible since H∗(B, mB\r
01) is k-projective.\r
If E is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of the dga A, the sum mE\r
03+mE\r
12+mE\r
21 is a\r
cocycle in a complex computing the derived Hochschild cohomology of H∗(A). Its\r
cohomology class does not depend on the choice of the minimal model. This derived\r
Hochschild cohomology class γA ∈ dHH3,−1(H∗(A)) associated with A generalizes\r
the Hochschild cohomology class of a dga over a field studied by Benson, Krause,\r
and Schwede in [2]. For example, γA determines all triple matric Massey products\r
in H∗(A).\r
Let k = Z/p2 with p an odd prime, and let A be the dga which has a copy of\r
k in degrees 0 and 1 and multiplication by p as the differential A1 → A0. Then\r
H∗(A) is an exterior algebra over Fp on a class in degree one. In Example 5.1, we\r
describe a minimal dA∞-algebra model of A. The derived Hochschild cohomology\r
class γA defined by means of this minimal model is non-zero.\r
The information encoded in a minimal dA∞-algebra model is not restricted to\r
the resolution of H∗(A) and the triple Massey products. In fact, we can recover the\r
dga from a minimal dA∞-algebra model:\r
Theorem 1.2. For a dA∞-algebra E, there is an associated differential graded\r
algebra Tot HomE(E, E). If E is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of a dga A, the dga\r
Tot HomE(E, E) is quasi-isomorphic to A.\r
Therefore, we have given an answer to the question of which additional structure\r
is needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type of a dga over a commutative\r
ground ring from its homology algebra: A k-projective resolution of its homology\r
equipped with a minimal dA∞-algebra structure provides the necessary information.\r
A different approach to describe quasi-isomorphism types of dgas is to use Post\u0002nikov systems and k-invariants. This approach is used by Dugger and Shipley in

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 3\r
[4, §4] for their study of topological equivalences of dgas. One advantage of the\r
minimal dA∞-algebra structures introduced in the present paper is that they also\r
exist for dgas with homology in negative degrees.\r
One may apply our results to Ext-algebras. If M is a k-module, the Yoneda\u0002algebra Ext∗\r
k\r
(M, M) is the homology of the endomorphism dga Homk(P, P) of a k\u0002projective resolution P of M. Hence a minimal dA∞-algebra model for Homk(P, P)\r
provides a k-projective resolution of Ext∗\r
k\r
(M, M) with structure maps mij . This\r
structure is well defined up to E2-equivalence, and it reflects the quasi-isomorphism\r
type of Homk(P, P). We calculate it for Ext∗\r
Z\r
(Z/p, Z/p). This generalizes the\r
existence of a minimal A∞-structure on the extension algebra of a module over an\r
algebra over a field [13, §3.3].\r
Organization. In the second section, we define dA∞-algebras and explain how\r
they generalize A∞-algebras. We introduce bidgas and twisted dgas and define the\r
notion of E2-equivalence. In the third section, we explain how dgas can be resolved\r
by bidgas. This makes use of Bousfield’s theory of resolution model categories.\r
The fourth section features the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we define\r
the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with a dga and describe the\r
examples mentioned in the Introduction. In the sixth section, we introduce modules\r
over dA∞-algebras and use the enrichment of module categories in twisted chain\r
complexes to prove Theorem 1.2. The last section contains four lemmas needed in\r
Section 4.\r
Notation and conventions. Throughout the paper, k is a commutative ground\r
ring, and all tensor products are taken over k. We consider (N, Z)-bigraded k\u0002modules E = (Est)s∈N,t∈Z. Their shift is defined by E[i, j]st = Es−i,t−j . We\r
sometimes refer to the N-grading as the horizontal direction and to the Z-grading\r
as the vertical direction.\r
The tensor product of two bigraded k-modules E and F is the bigraded k-module\r
E ⊗ F with\r
(1.3) (E ⊗ F)uv =\r
M\r
i+p=u, j+q=v\r
Eij ⊗ Epq.\r
We follow the Kozul sign convention. For maps f : W → X[i, j], g : Y → Z[p, q]\r
and elements w ∈ Wst, y ∈ Yuv this means (f ⊗ g)(w ⊗ y) = (−1)hw,gif(w) ⊗ g(y)\r
with hw, gi = sp + tq. Similarly, we get (f ⊗ g)(f\r
0 ⊗ g0\r
) = (−1)hf\r
0\r
,giff0 ⊗ gg0\r
for\r
tensor products of composable maps. Tensor product, shift, and sign convention\r
for k-modules with a single Z-grading are given accordingly.\r
We assume familiarity with the basics about A∞-algebras, as for example de\u0002scribed in Section 3 of Keller’s survey [13]. In our sign convention for A∞-algebras,\r
we follow Lef`evre [14] and ask the structure maps\r
P\r
mj of an A∞-algebra to satisfy\r
(−1)rq+tmj (1\r
⊗r ⊗ mq ⊗ 1⊗t\r
) = 0. Remark 4.4 explains our choice of signs.\r
2. dA∞-algebras and twisted chain complexes\r
Our main object of study is the following generalization of an A∞-algebra whose\r
definition was already outlined in the Introduction.\r
Definition 2.1. A derived A∞-algebra (dA∞-algebra for short) is a (N, Z)-bigraded\r
k-module E with k-module maps mij : E⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] and a unit map\r
ηE : k → E for i ≥ 0, j ≥ 1 satisfying\r
(2.2)uv X\r
i+p=u, j+q=v+1\r
r+1+t=j\r
j,q≥1, i,r,p,t≥0\r
(−1)rq+t+pjmE\r
ij (1\r

for all u ≥ 0, v ≥ 1 and the unit condition:\r
mE\r
01ηE = 0, mE02(ηE ⊗ 1) = 1 = mE02(1 ⊗ ηE), and\r
mE\r
ij (1\r
⊗r−1 ⊗ ηE ⊗ 1⊗j−r\r
) = 0 if i + j ≥ 3 with 1 ≤ r ≤ j\r
(2.3)\r
Example 2.4. A derived A∞-algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 is the\r
same as a (strictly unital) A∞-algebra with the m0j as structure maps: the equa\u0002tions (2.2)uv for u = 0 are the A∞-relations. Since a k-dga A is a special instance\r
of an A∞-algebra, it is a dA∞-algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 for which\r
only mA\r
01 and mA\r
02 may be non-zero.\r
Definition 2.5. A map of dA∞-algebras from E to F consists of a family of k\u0002module maps fpq : E⊗q → F[p, 1 − (p + q)] with p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 1 satisfying\r
X\r
i+p=v, j+q=v+1\r

Example 2.9. Maps between dA∞-algebras concentrated in horizontal degree 0\r
are maps of A∞-algebras.\r
In Section 4, we will give an equivalent but more economic description of dA∞-\r
algebras and their maps in terms of a structure on the reduced tensor algebra of\r
E[0, 1]. Amongst others, we employ it to define the composition of dA∞-algebra\r
maps and the notion of a module over a dA∞-algebra, and it will also help to\r
explain the signs. We use the less streamlined Definition 2.1 here since both our\r
examples and our notion of equivalence fit in more naturally.\r
We single out an interesting special case of a dA∞-algebra:\r
Definition 2.10. A bidga is a dA∞-algebra B with mB\r
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3. A map\r
f : A → B of bidgas is a map of dA∞-algebras with fpq = 0 for p+q ≥ 2. We write\r
bidgakfor the resulting category.\r
Of course, dgas give rise to bidgas concentrated in horizontal degree 0.\r
Remark 2.11. The category bidgak admits a different description. Let biChk\r
be the category of (N, Z)-graded bicomplexes of k-modules. Objects are bigraded\r
k-modules E with differentials d0 : E → E[0, 1] and d1 : E → E[1, 0] satisfying\r
d0d0 = 0, d1d1 = 0, and d0d1 = d1d0. The tensor product of bigraded k-modules\r
induces a symmetric monoidal product on biChk. A monoid in biChk is a bicomplex\r
B with a multiplication µ: B ⊗ B → B satisfying associativity, two Leibniz rules,\r
and a unit condition. Setting mB\r
01 = d0, mB\r
11 = d1 and mB\r
02 = µ, we observe that\r
the six non-trivial formulas (2.2)uv for u + v ≤ 3 are the associativity law, the two\r
Leibniz rules, and the three identities for the differentials. After comparing the unit\r
conditions, we see that bidgakis the category of monoids in biChk. This is similar\r
to the characterization of dgas as the monoids in the category of chain complexes\r
with respect to the tensor product of chain complexes.

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 5\r
Definition 2.12. A twisted dga (tdga for short) is a dA∞-algebra T for which only\r
mT\r
02 and mT\r
i1 with i ≥ 0 may be non-zero. A map f : T → S of tdgas is a map of\r
dA∞-algebras with fpq = 0 if q ≥ 2. We write tdgakfor the resulting category.\r
Every bidga is a tdga. The name twisted dga is chosen in view of\r
Definition 2.13. [6] A twisted chain complex E is an (N, Z)-graded k-module with\r
differentials d\r
E\r
i\r
: E → E[i, 1 − i] for i ≥ 0 satisfying\r
(2.14)u\r
X\r
i+p=u\r
(−1)ididp = 0\r
for u ≥ 0. A map of twisted complexes E → F is a family of maps fi: E → F[i, −i]\r
satisfying\r

P\r
The composition of two maps f : E → F and g : F → G is defined by (gf)u =\r
i+p=u\r
gifp. We write tChk for the resulting category.\r
A class of examples arises from the fact that biChk is a subcategory of tChk. The\r
signs in Definition 2.13 differ from those in [6]. We explain our choice in Remark\r
4.4. Some authors use the term ‘multicomplex’ instead of ‘twisted chain complex’.\r
Remark 2.16. Similarly as in Remark 2.11, the tensor product of graded modules\r
defines a symmetric monoidal product on tChk. Monoids in tChk are tgas. The\r
resulting composition tdga maps is of course a special case of the composition of\r
dA∞-algebra maps to be given in Definition 4.5.\r
Let E be a dA∞-algebra. Identifying (2.2)uv for v = 1 with (2.14)u, we see that\r
the mE\r
i1 with i ≥ 0 specify the underlying twisted chain complex of E. For a map\r
f : E → F of dA∞-algebras, the fi1 form a map of the underlying twisted chain\r
complexes. We thus occasionally write di for mE\r
i1 when we refer to the underlying\r
twisted chain complex of a dA∞-algebra E.\r
Remark 2.17. The underlying twisted chain complex is one instance in which\r
twisted chain complexes behave to dA∞-algebras as unbounded chain complexes\r
behave to A∞-algebras. This analogy turns out to be fruitful, and we frequently\r
exploit it in Sections 4 and 6.\r
Next we study the passage from twisted chain complexes to chain complexes.\r
There is a total complex functor\r
Tot: tChk → Chk, Totn X =\r
M\r
s+t=n\r
Xst,\r
where the differential d: Totn X → Totn−1 X is P\r
i≥0\r
d\r
X\r
i\r
. A map of twisted com\u0002plexes f : X → Y induces a map P\r
i≥0\r
fi of total complexes. This is well defined\r
since only finitely many d\r
X\r
i\r
or fileave a fixed Xst.\r
If we consider the total complex as a twisted chain complex concentrated in\r
horizontal degree 0, there is a map ρX : X → Tot X of twisted chain complexes. Its\r
component (ρX)i: X → (Tot X)[i, −i] is the inclusion of Xi∗ into (Tot X)[i, −i]i∗.\r
We can interpret ρ as a natural transformation from the identity on tChk to Tot.\r
The presence of this natural transformation is one advantage of the category of\r
twisted chain complexes over the category of bicomplexes.\r
Lemma 2.18. The functor Tot: tChk → Chk is strongly monoidal, and ρ is a\r
strong monoidal transformation. In particular, if E is a tdga, then Tot E is a dga,\r
and ρE : E → Tot E is a map of tdgas.

6 STEFFEN SAGAVE\r
The total complex has a filtration defined by F\r
p\r
(Tot X)n =\r
L\r
s≤p Xs,n−s. The\r
E2-term of the resulting spectral sequence is E2\r
pq\r
∼= Hh\r
p Hv\r
q\r
(X). Here we write\r
Hv\r
∗\r
(E) for the ‘vertical’ homology of E with respect to the differential d0. By\r
(2.14)u for u = 2, d1 induces a differential on Hv\r
∗\r
(E), and we write Hh\r
∗\r
(Hv\r
∗\r
(E)) for\r
the resulting ‘horizontal’ homology group.\r
Maps of twisted complexes induce maps of spectral sequences: given f : E → F\r
in tChk, f0 is a d0-chain map on E → F, and formula (2.15)u for u = 1 ensures\r
that Hv\r
∗\r
(f0) induces chain map with respect to the d1-differential Hv\r
∗\r
(d1). Hence\r
we obtain Hh\r
∗\r
(Hv\r
∗\r
(f0)) on the E2-term, and so on.\r
Definition 2.19. A map f : E → F of twisted complexes is an E2-equivalence if\r
Hh\r
s\r
(Hv\r
t\r
(f0)) is an isomorphism for s ∈ N, t ∈ Z. A map of bicomplexes, bidgas,\r
twisted dgas or derived A∞-algebras is an E2-equivalence if the underlying map of\r
twisted chain complexes is.\r
Accordingly, f is an E1-equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on Hv\r
∗\r
, and\r
every E1-equivalence is an E2-equivalence.\r
The following lemma is immediate.\r
Lemma 2.20. If X is a twisted chain complex with E2-homology concentrated in\r
horizontal degree 0, then ρX : X → Tot X is an E2-equivalence.\r
3. Resolving dgas by bidgas\r
The aim of this section is to construct resolutions of dgas that induce resolutions\r
of their graded homology algebras. We saw that a dga can be considered as a bidga\r
concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Particularly, a graded k-algebra is a bidga\r
concentrated in horizontal degree 0 with both differentials trivial.\r
Definition 3.1. A termwise k-projective resolution of a graded algebra Λ is a\r
termwise k-projective bidga E with trivial vertical differential together with an\r
E2-equivalence E → Λ of bidgas.\r
Here we think of a bidga with trivial vertical differential as a differential graded\r
algebra in graded algebras. If E → Λ is a termwise k-projective resolution, E∗,0 is\r
a dga which is k-projective and whose homology is isomorphic to Λ0 concentrated\r
in degree 0. In other words, a termwise k-projective resolution is the graded analog\r
of the resolution of a k-algebra by a degreewise k-projective dga.\r
If the graded algebra is the homology of a differential graded algebra, we can ask\r
even more:\r
Definition 3.2. Let A be a k-dga. A k-projective E1-resolution of A is a bidga B\r
together with an E2-equivalence B → A of bidgas such that Hv\r
st(B) is k-projective\r
and the map k → Hv\r
00(B) induced by the unit k → B splits as a k-module map.\r
A termwise k-projective E1-resolution of a dga A is a termwise k-projective\r
resolution of the graded algebra Hv\r
∗\r
(A) which is induced from a resolution of the\r
dga and satisfies an additional unit condition.\r
Example 3.3. Let p be an odd prime and k = Z/p2. The k-dga A = Λ∗\r
Z/p2 (w)\r
with |w| = 1 and d(w) = p is non-formal and has homology Λ∗\r
Fp\r
(w) with |w| = 1.\r
It is also considered in [1, §5.2]. We will give a k-projective E1-resolution of A.\r
Consider the (N, Z)-bigraded k-algebra\r
V = k[a, b, u, v]/(a\r
2\r
, b2, au − bv, auv, buv, u2, v2),\r
with |a| = |b| = (0, 0) and |u| = |v| = (0, 1). We set d\r
V\r
0\r
(u) = a and d\r
V\r
0\r
(v) = b. This\r
extends uniquely to a differential on V . We think of V as a dga concentrated in

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 7\r
horizontal degree 0. Its homology is Λ∗\r
k\r
(z) with z is represented by au. Let H be\r
the (N, Z)-bigraded k-algebra\r
Λ\r
∗\r
k\r
(x) ⊗ Γ\r
∗\r
k\r
(y) with |x| = (1, 0), |y| = (2, 0),\r
concentrated in vertical degree 0. We define B = V ⊗ H, so that Bst = Vs0 ⊗ H0t.\r
The multiplications on V and H turn B into a bigraded k-algebra. Since d\r
H\r
0 = 0\r
for degree reasons, the d\r
V\r
0 on V induces a vertical differential d\r
B\r
0\r
satisfying the\r
Leibniz rule. We define d\r
B\r
1\r
(xyi) = (p − pa + b)yi and d\r
B\r
1\r
(yi) = (p − b − ab)xyi−1,\r
where yiis the divided power algebra generator in degree 2i. The d\r
B\r
1\r
is linear with\r
respect to a, b, u, and v, and d\r
B\r
0 and d\r
B\r
1\r
commute.\r
It is easy to see Hv\r
∗\r
(B) = Λ∗\r
k\r
(x, z) ⊗ Γ\r
∗\r
k\r
(y) as well as d1(yi) = p x yi−1 and\r
d1(x yi) = pyi. Hence B is a bidga for which Hv\r
∗\r
(B) is bidegreewise k-projective.\r
A map of bidgas α: B → A is defined by setting\r
α(y0) = 1, α(a) = p, α(b) = −p, α(u) = w, and α(v) = −w.\r
This is multiplicative and compatible with the relations among a, b, u, and v. Since\r
α(d\r
B\r
1\r
(x)) = 0, the α is also compatible with d\r
B\r
1\r
. Therefore, it is a bidga map. On\r
vertical homology α induces Hv\r
∗\r
(α): Hv\r
∗\r
(B) → Hv\r
∗\r
(A) sending y0\r
to 1 and z to w.\r
This is easily seen to be a resolution of Hv\r

Returning to the general case, a map of k-projective E1-resolutions from B → A\r
to B0 → A is a bidga map f : B → B0 making the obvious triangle commutative.\r
It is defined to be an E2-equivalence if f is one.\r
Theorem 3.4. Every k-dga A admits a k-projective E1-resolution B → A. Two\r
such resolutions can be related by a zig-zag of E2-equivalences between k-projective\r
E1-resolutions.\r
The proof of the theorem occupies the rest of the section. It uses Quillen’s\r
language of model categories [15, 9]. The point is to use the cofibrant replacement\r
in an appropriate model structure on the category sdgak of simplicial dgas.\r
We start by briefly recalling Bousfield’s general setup for resolution model struc\u0002tures [3], or rather the dual version of [10]. Let C be a pointed model category.\r
Let P be a class of group-objects in Ho(C). A morphism p: X → Y in Ho(C) is a\r
P-epi if p∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is onto for every P ∈ P and n ≥ 0, where [X, Y ]n =\r
Ho(C)(ΣnX, Y ). An object A ∈ Ho(C) is P-projective if p∗ : [A, X]n → [A, Y ]n is\r
onto for all P-epis p and n ≥ 0. Maps in C (resp. objects in C) are P-epis (resp.\r
P-projective) if they are in Ho(C). A map in C is a P-projective cofibration if it\r
has the left lifting property with respect to all P-epi fibrations. A map X → Y in\r
C is P-free if it is a composition of an inclusion X → X\r
`\r
P with P cofibrant and\r
P-projective and an acyclic cofibration X\r
`\r
P → Y . We say that Ho(C) has enough\r
P-projectives if every object X ∈ Ho(C) admits a P-epi Y → X with P-projective\r
source. In this case, we call P a class of projective models in Ho(C).\r
The next definition makes use of the standard model structure on the category\r
of simplicial groups ([15, II.3.7]), the Reedy model structure on sC [7, VII.2.12],\r
and the notion of the latching object LnX and its structure map LnX → Xn for\r
X ∈ sC [7, VII.1.5].\r
Definition 3.5. Let f : X → Y be a map in sC.\r
(i) f is a P-equivalence if f∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is a weak equivalence in simplicial\r
groups for all P ∈ P and n ≥ 0.\r
(ii) f is a P-fibration if it is a Reedy-fibration and f∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is a\r
fibration of simplicial groups for all P ∈ P and n ≥ 0.\r
(iii) f is a P-cofibration if the induced maps Xn\r
`\r
LnX LnY → Yn are P-projective\r
cofibrations for all n ≥ 0.

Theorem 3.6. [3, Theorem 3.3] Let C be a right proper pointed model category\r
and let P be a class of projective models for Ho(C). With the above P-equivalences,\r
P-fibrations, and P-cofibrations, sC becomes a right proper model category. It is\r
simplicial with respect to the external simplicial structure.\r
We frequently use the following feature of this model structure:\r
Lemma 3.7. A P-cofibration in sC is termwise a P-projective cofibration in C.\r
Proof. This is a consequence of [8, Lemma 15.3.9], compare [3, Lemma 5.3]. \u0003\r
Our main example is the category Chk with the projective model structure [9,\r
Theorem 2.3.11]. Since Chk is stable, all objects in Ho(Chk) are cogroup objects.\r
Let P be the set of objects {S\r
n(k)|n ∈ Z} in Ho(Chk) = D(k), where Sn(k)i = k\r
if i = n and 0 otherwise. The P-epis are the maps which induce surjections in\r
homology.\r
Lemma 3.8. With this P, the category Ho(Chk) has enough P-projectives. An\r
object in Ho(Chk) is P-projective if and only if it has degreewise k-projective ho\u0002mology.\r
Proof. Since every object is the codomain of a P-epi mapping out of a sum of\r
objects in P, there are enough P-projectives. Applying this to a P-projective object\r
X shows that X is a retract of a sum of objects in P. Hence X has degreewise\r
k-projective homology. On the other hand, an object with degreewise k-projective\r
homology is a retract of a sum of objects of P, and therefore P-projective. \u0003\r
All objects in Chk are fibrant, so Chk is right proper. Theorem 3.6 yields the\r
P-model structure on sChk.\r
Analogous to the classical case of simplicial abelian groups and simplicial rings,\r
simplicial dgas can be considered as the monoids in the category sChk of simplicial\r
chain complexes with respect to the termwise tensor product.\r
Proposition 3.9. The forgetful functor U : sdgak → sChk creates a cofibrantly\r
generated model structure on sdgakin which a map f is a P-fibration or a P\u0002equivalence if U(f) is. Cofibrant objects in sdgak are termwise P-projective cofi\u0002brant in Chk. The unit map of a cofibrant replacement in sdgak\r
splits in homology.\r
Proof. First notice that the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated.\r
To obtain the generating cofibrations I and generating acyclic cofibrations J, one\r
has to add the generating acyclic cofibrations of the Reedy model structure [8,\r
Proposition 15.6.24] to the two sets of maps described in [10, Lemma 2.7].\r
The projective model structure on Chk creates a model structure on dgak[18,\r
§5], which gives rise to a Reedy model structure on sdgak. As the matching object\r
functor is defined as a limit and the forgetful functor U commutes with limits, a\r
map f in sdgakis a Reedy fibration or a Reedy weak equivalence if and only if\r
U(f) is.\r
Since all objects in simplicial abelian groups are fibrant, the P-fibrant objects in\r
sChk coincide with the Reedy fibrant objects. Therefore, the Reedy fibrant replace\u0002ment functor in sdgak\r
is a fibrant replacement functor for the P-model structure\r
to be constructed.\r
The cotensor of the external simplicial structure on sChk is defined as a limit [7,\r
p. 371] and therefore extends to a functor\r
homsdgak: S\r
op × sdgak → sdgak\r
.\r
As the P-model structure on sChk is simplicial, homsdgak(−, Y ) maps weak equiv\u0002alences to P-equivalences and cofibrations to P-fibrations provided Y is P-fibrant.

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 9\r
Hence the simplicial path object for a fibrant object qualifies as a path object for\r
the P-model structure on sdgak we are heading for.\r
Since the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated, the verification\r
of the axioms for the P-model structure on sdgak now follows from applying [18,\r
Lemma 2.3(2)] to the left adjoint of U. As in Quillen’s original argument [15,\r
II.4.9], one can reduce the assumptions to presence of a path object and the fibrant\r
replacement functor as established above.\r
The generating cofibrations T(I) of the P-model structure on sdgak are obtained\r
by applying the free associative algebra functor T to I. If X is P-projective and\r
cofibrant, −⊗X preserves P-free maps. Cobase change also preserves P-free maps.\r
The maps in I are either termwise acyclic cofibrations in the projective model\r
structure on Chk, or termwise of the form X → X\r
`\r
P with P ∈ P. By the careful\r
analysis of the free associative algebra functor carried out in [18, Lemma 6.2], it\r
follows that for a termwise P-projective cofibrant X in sdgak, the map X → Y\r
obtained from attaching a generating cofibration f ∈ T(I) to X is is isomorphic\r
to the inclusion of X into the colimit of a countable sequence of termwise P-free\r
maps: inspecting the proof the second statement of the cited lemma, we see that\r
it is enough to provide the last four statements and Lemma 3.10.\r
The initial object of sdgakis itself termwise P-projective. Hence the map from\r
the initial object k to a cofibrant replacement constructed by means of the small\r
object argument applied to T(I) is termwise a transfinite composition of P-free\r
maps. Therefore, it splits in homology. In particular, any cofibrant replacement is\r
termwise P-projective cofibrant. By the retract argument, all cofibrant objects are\r
termwise P-projective cofibrant. \u0003\r
Let f : X → Y and g : X0 → Y\r
0 be maps in Chk or sChk. We define the pushout\r
product map f\u0003g to be the induced map Y ⊗ X0 `\r
X⊗X0 X ⊗ Y\r
0 → Y ⊗ Y0\r
.\r
Lemma 3.10. Let K be the class of termwise acyclic cofibrations in sChk, and let\r
L be the class of maps in sChk which are termwise of the form X → X\r
`\r
P with\r
P a P-projective cofibrant object. Then (K ∪ L)\u0003(K ∪ L) ⊂ (K ∪ L).\r
Proof. The pushout product axiom [19, Definition 3.1] holds in Chk. It states\r
that if f and g are cofibrations in Chk, then the pushout product map f\u0003g is a\r
cofibration which is acyclic if f or g is. The axiom immediately implies K\u0003K ⊂ K.\r
Since objects in P are cofibrant, it also shows that for P ∈ P and f ∈ K, the map\r
P ⊗ f is again in K. This argument implies K\u0003L ∪ L\u0003K ⊂ K. If both maps are\r
in L, it is enough to show that for two P-projective cofibrant objects P, P0 ∈ P,\r
their product P ⊗P\r
0\r
is P-projective cofibrant. Cofibrancy is clear. Since both have\r
k-projective homology, the E2-term of the bicomplex spectral sequence computing\r
the homology of P ⊗ P\r
0\r
consists only of a single non-trivial line in which all entries\r
are k-projective. By Lemma 3.8, P ⊗ P\r
0\r
is P-cofibrant. \u0003\r
We need an instance of the Dold-Kan correspondence to go back and forth be\u0002tween simplicial chain complexes and bicomplexes. The version in [7, III Theorem\r
2.5] is sufficiently general to apply to our context.\r
The associated chain complex and normalized chain complex are functors\r
C : sChk → biChk and N : sChk → biChk .\r
The first is defined by C(X)s∗ = Xs with horizontal differential given by the al\u0002ternating sum of the simplicial face maps, and N(X) is the quotient of C(X) by\r
the subobject generated by the image of the degeneracies. The functor N is an\r
equivalence of categories. Its inverse Γ: biChk → sChk can be defined by\r

with the simplicial structure maps described on [7, p. 148].\r
The monoidal properties of these functors are as in the classical case discussed\r
in [19, §2.3,§2.4]. We have a shuffle map ∇ and the Alexander-Whitney map AW,\r
∇: CX ⊗ CY → C(X ⊗ Y ) and AW : C(X ⊗ Y ) → CX ⊗ CY,\r
∇ is a lax monoidal transformation, AW is a lax comonoidal transformation, and\r
both maps preserve the subcomplexes of degenerate simplicies and induce\r
∇: NX ⊗ NY → N(X ⊗ Y ) and AW : N(X ⊗ Y ) → NX ⊗ NY.\r
For a simplicial dga X, the associated chain complex of the underlying simplicial\r
chain complex is a bidga with multiplication defined by\r
CX ⊗ CX ∇−→ C(X ⊗ X) → C(X).\r
Similarly, NX is a bidga. For a bidga B, the Alexander-Whitney map induces the\r
structure of a simplicial dga on Γ(B) [19, (2.9)]. As explained in [19, Remark 2.14],\r
the functors Γ and N do not induce an equivalence between sdgak and bidgak, due\r
to the failure of the unit of the adjunction to be monoidal. However, the adjunction\r
counit isomorphism NΓ ∼= idbiChk\r
is monoidal on the level of complexes [19, Lemma\r
2.11], which is sufficient for our purposes.\r
Lemma 3.11. (i) The functor C maps P-equivalences of simplicial dgas to E2-\r
equivalences of bidgas.\r
(ii) For a k-bidga B, there is a canonical E2-equivalence C(Γ(B)) → B of bidgas\r
which is natural in B.\r
Proof. It is enough to check (i) additively. Since C commutes with taking verti\u0002cal homology, the assertion follows from the definition of P-equivalences and E2-\r
equivalences.\r
The map in (ii) is the one inducing the counit N(Γ(B)) → B. It is a map of\r
bidgas since the counit is monoidal and the shuffle map is compatible with the\r
degeneracies. Both C and Γ (but not N) commute with taking vertical homology,\r
so the Dold-Kan correspondence for simplicial k-modules and Ch+\r
k\r
applied in each\r
vertical degree shows that C(Γ(B)) → B is an E2-equivalence. \u0003\r
Proof of Theorem 3.4. We consider Γ(A), the constant simplicial dga A, and its\r
cofibrant replacement Γ(A)\r
cof. Lemma 3.8 and Proposition 3.9 show that Γ(A)cof\r
has k-projective vertical homology. The unit is the composite k → C(Γ(k)) →\r
C(Γ(A)\r
cof), which splits in vertical homology by the last part of Proposition 3.9.\r
Lemma 3.11 then shows that the composite\r
C(Γ(A)\r
cof) → C(Γ(A)) → A\r
is a k-projective E1-resolution. The second statement is the A = A0case of the\r
next lemma. \u0003\r

4. Minimal dA∞-algebras\r
We start by giving an alternative description of dA∞-algebras and their maps.\r
Disregarding unit conditions, an A∞-algebra structure on a Z-graded k-module\r
M can be encoded by giving a differential on the reduced tensor algebra of the\r
suspension of A [13, 21]. Next we explain how the structure of a twisted chain\r
complex on the reduced tensor algebra (in bigraded k-modules) describes a dA∞-\r
algebra.\r
Let S be the shift [0, 1] of bigraded k-modules. There is a canonical isomorphism\r
σ : S → id[0, 1] of degree (0, 1). It induces an isomorphism\r
Ψj : Homk(E\r

For a k-linear map mE\r
ij : E⊗j → E[i, 2−(i+j)], we define me\r
E,1\r
ij : SE⊗j → SE[i, 1−i]\r
to be Ψj (mE\r
ij ).\r
Let T : biMod-k → biMod-k be the reduced tensor algebra functor of bigraded\r
k-modules, i.e., T E =\r
L\r
j≥1 E⊗j\r
. Let mE\r
ij : E⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] be a family\r
of k-linear maps with i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 1. For fixed i, the me\r
E,1\r
ij assemble to a map\r
me\r
E,1\r

: T SE → SE[i, 1 − i]. More generally, we define\r

Lemma 4.1. Let E be a bigraded k-module and let mE\r
ij : E⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] be\r
a family of k-linear maps with i ≥ 0 and j ≥ 1 satisfying the unit condition (2.3).\r

A similar description applies to maps. Given bigraded k-modules E and F and\r
k-linear maps fpq : E⊗q → F[p, 1 − (p + q)] with p ≥ 0, q ≥ 1, we define the map\r
fe1\r
pq to be Ψq(f): SE⊗q → SF[p, −p]. The fe1pq assemble to fe1p\r

We define\r

Lemma 4.3. Let E and F be dA∞-algebras and let fpq : E⊗q → F[p, 1 − (p + q)]\r
a family of k-linear maps with p ≥ 0 and q ≥ 1 satisfying the unit condition (2.7).\r

Remark 4.4. One advantage of using the me\r
E\r
ij and the fe1\r
ij is that their bidegrees\r
|me\r
E\r
ij | = (i, 1 − i) and |fe1\r
ij | = (i, −i) do not depend on j. As one can already see\r
by comparing the last lemma with Definition 2.5, this reduces the complexity of\r
signs considerably. Because of this, we will frequently switch to the me ij for explicit\r
calculations.\r
However, there is still a choice behind our sign convention. For example, one\r
may omit the sign in the definition of twisted chain complexes. This would change\r
the sign in the definition of dA∞-algebras and, in turn, the sign in the Leibniz rule\r
for bidgas. This would be in conflict with the signs resulting from the Dold-Kan\r
correspondence relating biChk and sdgak. In other words, our sign convention is\r
chosen to ensure that the chain complex associated to a simplicial dga is a dA∞-\r
algebra.\r
At this point we can also make up the promised definition of the composition of\r
dA∞-algebra maps.\r
Definition 4.5. Given two maps g : D → E and g : E → F, the component (fgf)u\r
of fg is P\r

An A∞-algebra is minimal if mA\r

Definition 4.6. A dA∞-algebra E is minimal if mE\r

The device to produce minimal dA∞-algebras is the following proposition. It\r
promotes both the statement and the proof of [11, Theorem 1] about A∞-algebras\r
to the context of dA∞-algebras.\r
Proposition 4.7. Let B be a bidga, let E be its homology with respect to mB\r

splits as a k-module map, then there exists\r

The fln satisfy (2.6)uv for u + v = l + n by construction. By assumption, the\r
inclusions of the submodules on which the unit condition (2.7) requires fln to be\r
zero splits. Hence we may assume fln to be zero there. \u0003\r
The input for the last proposition will be a k-projective E1-resolution arising\r
form Theorem 3.4. Since these are only well defined up to E2-equivalence, we need\r
to check that such an E2-equivalence of bidgas induces a map of the associated\r
minimal dA∞-algebras. This issue does not come up when constructing minimal\r
models in the world of A∞-algebras, since the underlying graded algebra of a min\u0002imal A∞-model is unique up to isomorphism [13, §8.7].\r
To formulate the next proposition, we need to introduce the notion of a homotopy\r
of dA∞-algebra maps. We only define it in a special case.\r
Definition 4.9. Let f and g be dA∞-algebra maps from a minimal dA∞-algebra E\r
to a bidga C. A homotopy from g to f is a family of maps ehi: T SE → SC[i, −1−i]

(4.11).\r
Assume that we have constructed βeij and hij for i + j < l + n such that (2.6)uv\r
holds for u + v ≤ l + n and (4.10)uv holds for u + v < l + n. Then yln is defined,\r
and Lemma 7.10 provides me\r
C,1\r

ln to be represented by yeln.\r
Lemma 7.17 shows that (2.6)uv holds for u + v = l + n + 1, and the unit condition\r
(2.7) can be checked readily. Since E is k-projective we can find ehln such that\r
(4.10)uv holds for u+v = l +n. The splitting of the unit of E enables us to change\r
ehln such that (4.11) holds. \u0003\r
We can now give the proof of the first main theorem from the introduction.\r
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Given a k-dga A, we apply Theorem 3.4 to obtain a k\u0002projective E1-resolution B → A. Then B satisfies the assumptions of Proposition\r
4.7, which provides an E2-equivalence E → B. The composition E → A is the\r
desired minimal dA∞-algebra model.\r
The resolution B → A is well defined up to E2-equivalence of k-projective E1-\r
resolutions. Given such an E2-equivalence B → C, Proposition 4.12 provides an\r
E2-equivalence E → F between the associated minimal dA∞-algebras. \u0003\r
Lemma 3.12 and Proposition 4.12 imply\r
Corollary 4.13. Minimal dA∞-algebra models of quasi-isomorphic dgas may be\r
related by a zig-zag of E2-equivalences between minimal dA∞-algebras.\r
Remark 4.14. We do not claim that every termwise k-projective resolution E of\r
H∗(A) may be extended to a minimal dA∞-algebra model for A. We only show\r
that this happens if E is the vertical homology of a bidga resolving A.

Remark 4.15. The underlying twisted chain complex of a minimal dA∞-algebra\r
model of A is a ‘homological multicomplex resolution’ of the underlying chain com\u0002plex of A; compare [17].\r
5. Examples and an application\r
In this section, we give two examples for minimal dA∞-algebra structures and\r
apply our theory to define the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with\r
a dga.\r
Example 5.1. Let p be an odd prime, k = Z/p2, and A the dga (k\r
·p\r
−→ k). In\r
Example 3.3, we gave a k-projective E1-resolution B → A with E := Hv\r
∗\r
(B) =\r
Λ\r
∗\r
k\r
(x, z) ⊗ Γ\r
∗\r
k\r
(y). Following the proof of Proposition 4.7, we now extend the multi\u0002plication and d\r
E\r
1\r
to a dA∞-algebra structure on E. A cycle selection map f01 can\r
be defined by extending\r
f01(z) = au, f01(x) = x, and f01(yi) = yi\r
multiplicatively. Then f01mE\r
02 − mB\r
02(f01 ⊗ f01) = 0. Consequently, mE\r
03 = 0, and\r
we can set f02 = 0 and f03 = 0. Since mE\r
11 = d\r
E\r
1\r
, we define f11 : E → B[1, −1] by\r
f11(yi) = (v + av)xyi−1 and f11(x yi\r
) = (pu − v)yi.\r
The mE\r
12 is represented by\r
z12 = f11mE\r
02 − mB\r
02(f01 ⊗ f11 + f11 ⊗ f01).\r
One calculates z12 = 0, hence mE\r
12 = 0 and we can set f12 = 0. The mE\r
21 is\r
represented by z21 = f11mE\r
11 + mB\r
11f11. One checks\r
mE\r
21(yi\r
) = z yi−1 and mE\r
21(x yi\r
) = z x yi−1.\r
Furthermore, we set f21(x yi) = puvxyi−1 and f21(yi) = 0. The mE\r
ij and fij for\r
i + j ≥ 4 vanish for degree reasons.\r
Example 5.7 below provides one way to detect that this E encodes non-trivial\r
information about A, for example the fact that A is not quasi-isomorphic to the\r
formal dga H∗(A) with trivial differential. Of course, Theorem 1.2 provides a\r
different reason this.\r
The example indicates the general procedure for finding a minimal dA∞-algebra\r
model of a given dga A. Since the resolutions provided by Theorem 3.4 are too\r
large to write down in terms of generators and relations, one has to first guess a k\u0002projective E1-resolution, for example by lifting a k-projective resolution of H∗(A)\r
to a bidga B coming with an E2-equivalence B → A. Then one can use the\r
constructive procedure of Proposition 4.7 to build E from B.\r
Remark 5.2. If k happens to be a field or, more generally, H∗(A) is k-projective\r
and the unit k → H0(A) splits, the minimal model of A as an A∞-algebra arising\r
from [11, Theorem 1] is one possible choice for the minimal dA∞-algebra model of\r
Theorem 1.1.\r
Let M be a k-module and let P be a k-projective resolution of M. The endomor\u0002phism dga Homk(P, P) is defined by Homk(P, P)j = Homk(P[j], P), where the lat\u0002ter denotes maps of graded k-modules. Its differential is d\r
Hom\r
j\r
(f) = d\r
P f−(−1)jf dP .\r
The quasi-isomorphism type of Homk(P, P) does not depend on the choice of the\r
resolution P. Its homology algebra is the Yoneda Ext-algebra of M with a sign\r
shift in the degree, i.e., H∗ Homk(P, P) = Ext−∗\r
k\r
(M, M).\r
A minimal dA∞-model for Homk(P, P) is a resolution E of Ext∗\r
k\r
(M, M) with\r
structure maps mE\r
ij . By Theorem 1.2, this structure enables us to recover the\r
quasi-isomorphism type of Homk(P, P).

Example 5.3. Let k = Z, p a prime, and M = Z/p. We will see that the resolution\r
of Ext∗\r
Z\r
(Z/p, Z/p) given by Z\r
·p ←− Z in every degree of the Ext-grading is part of a\r
minimal dA∞-algebra.\r
Let P be the two step resolution Z\r
·p ←− Z of Z/p. The dga A = HomZ(P, P)\r
may be described as follows (compare [5, §3.1]): Its underlying ungraded algebra\r
is Mat2(Z), the algebra of 2 × 2-matrices with entries in Z. Viewing elements of P\r
as column vectors with top entry the degree 0 part, Mat2(Z) operates on P. The\r
resulting grading of A is\r
A1 =\r

with |t| = (0, 0) and |λ| = (1, 0). The horizontal grading is specified through the\r

and f01 can be chosen to pick the displayed generators. The mE\r
02 provides the\r
multiplicative structure encoded in the exterior algebra. Since f01 is multiplicative,\r
we may choose f02 = 0 (and f0j = 0, mE\r
0j = 0 for j ≥ 3). Now z11 = mB\r
11f01, hence\r
mE\r
11(b) = pι and mE\r
11(ab) = pa. Since mB\r

f11(b) = \r

0 1 \u0001\r
The m12 is represented by z12 = f11mE\r

02(f01 ⊗ f11) − mB\r
02(f11 ⊗ f01). One\r

and that mE\r

all other mE\r

Our next aim is to define a variant of derived Hochschild cohomology for graded\r
k-algebras. It will generalize the Hochschild cohomology of graded k-algebras which\r
is for example used in [2].\r
We briefly recall from [1, §4] one way to define the derived Hochschild cohomology\r
dHH for ungraded k-algebras. (In [1], this theory is called Shukla cohomology.)\r
Considering an ungraded k-algebra Λ as a N-graded dga concentrated in degree\r
0, one can find a quasi-isomorphism A → Λ from a degreewise k-projective dga\r
A. The Hochschild complex of A is the bicomplex C\r
st(A) := Homk(A⊗s\r
, A[t])\r
with s, t ≥ 0. It has the usual Hochschild differential dHH : C\r
st → Cs+1,t and a\r
differential dHom : C\r
st → Cs,t+1 induced from that of A by considering Cs∗ as the\r
Hom-complex with source A⊗s and target A. Letting HH∗(A) be the cohomology\r
of the total complex of C\r
st, we define dHH∗\r
(Λ) := HH∗(A). This is well defined\r
since a quasi-isomorphism of k-projective dgas A → A0 over Λ induces a chain of\r
isomorphisms HH∗(A)\r

The relations of dHH and dHom imply dTotdTot = 0. The graded Hochschild co\u0002homology of E with coefficients in F is the homology of this total complex, i.e.,\r
HHqt(E, F) = Hq(Tot∗t C(E, F)).\r
Now let Λ be a graded k-algebra. We view Λ as a k-dga with trivial differential.\r
Applying vertical homology to the resolution provided by Theorem 3.4, we obtain\r
a termwise k-projective resolution E → Λ. The resolution is well defined up to\r
E2-equivalence between such E. We define the derived Hochschild cohomology of Λ\r
by\r
dHHqt(Λ) = HHqt(E, E).\r

Proposition 5.4. Let A be a k-dga, and let E → A be a minimal dA∞-algebra\r
model of A. Then the sum mE\r
03 + mE\r
12 + mE\r
21 is a cocycle in the complex computing\r
HH3,−1(E, E) = dHH3,−1(H∗(A)). Its cohomology class γA ∈ dHH3,−1(H∗A) does\r
not depend on the choice of E.\r
Proof. The four formulas (2.2)uv with u + v = 4 for the mE\r
ij can be expressed\r
as dHH(mE\r
03) = 0, dHH(mE12) + dHom(mE03) = 0, dHH(mE21) + dHom(mE12) = 0, and\r
dHom(mE\r
21) = 0. Hence dTot(mE\r
03 + mE\r
12 + mE\r
21) = 0.\r
Let f : E → F be an E2-equivalence of minimal dA∞-algebras. We check that the\r
elements (f01)∗(mE\r
03 + mE12 + mE21) and (f01)\r
∗\r
(mF\r
03 + mF12 + mF21) of Tot3,−1 C(E, F)\r
represent the same cohomology class. Since f is map of dA∞-algebras , it satisfies\r
the relations (2.6)uv for u + v = 3, and these can be rewritten as\r
(f01)∗(mE\r
03 + mE12 + mE21) − (f01)\r
∗\r
(mF\r
03 + mF12 + mF21) = dTot(f02 + f11).\r
\u0003\r
If a dga A is formal, i.e., quasi-isomorphic to H∗(A) with trivial differential,\r
then γA = 0 since a termwise k-projective resolution of H∗(A) provides a minimal\r
dA∞-algebra model for A with mij = for i + j ≥ 3. Hence a non-vanishing γA\r
shows that A is not formal, and that a given minimal dA∞-algebra model of A is\r
not equivalent to one with trivial higher mij .

Remark 5.5. For a dga over a field, there is a characteristic Hochschild cohomology\r
class γA ∈ HH3,−1(H∗(A)) which is studied in [2]. It is represented by the m3 of\r
a minimal A∞-algebra structure on H∗(A) and determines by evaluation all triple\r
matric Massey products in H∗(A). The characteristic dHH-class of a dga over a\r
commutative ring k given by the previous proposition is the natural generalization.\r
If k happens to be a field, the γA introduced here coincides with the one from [2],\r
as one can easily see from Remark 5.2 and [2, Remark 5.8].\r
If B is a bidga and B → A an E2-equivalence, B0∗ is a dga, and B → A restricts\r
to a map B0∗ → A of dgas which induces an surjection in homology. If E is the\r
minimal dA∞-algebra structure on Hv\r
∗\r
(B), the restriction of mE\r
03 to H∗(B0∗) is\r
part of an A∞-structure on H∗(B0∗). By evaluation, it determines triple Massey\r
products of B0∗. Moreover, if λ1, λ2, λ3 ∈ H∗(A) satisfy λ1λ2 = 0 = λ2λ3, we\r
may lift them to elements of H∗(B0∗), evaluate mE\r
03 on the lifts, and observe that\r
the image of the evaluation under the map to H∗(A) is an element of the Massey\r
product hλ1, λ2, λ3i. Hence the dHH-class determines all triple (matric) Massey\r
products in H∗(A). The difference to the HH-class of [2] is that the dHH-class does\r
not determine the Massey products in a k-linear fashion, since lifts of elements\r
along a surjection into a not necessarily projective k-module are involved.\r
We expect the dHH-class γA of a dga to share more properties with the HH-class\r
of [2], like the connection to realizability obstructions. We are not going to elaborate\r
those here. The dHH-class should also be compared to the universal Toda bracket\r
of a ring spectrum studied in [16]. The latter class is an even further generalization\r
of the (derived) Hochschild class and arises when one allows the sphere spectrum\r
of stable homotopy theory as ground ring. This class is an element in a Mac Lane\r
cohomology group and determines triple Toda brackets.\r
Remark 5.6. Derived Hochschild cohomology classes associated to dgas also ap\u0002pear in [1] and [4]: a dga A with only A0 and A1 possibly non-zero gives rise\r
to a crossed extension of H0(A) by H1(A) and hence to a cohomology class in\r
dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)) [1, 4.4.1. Theorem]. More generally, for a dga A with non\u0002negative homology, its first k-invariant lies in dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)) [4, §4].\r
If E → A is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of A, E∗0 is a k-projective resolution\r
of H0(A), and there is a restriction map dHH3,−1\r
k\r
(H∗(A)) → dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)).\r
One can check that the image of γA under this map recovers the cohomology classes\r
described above.\r
Example 5.7. We continue Example 5.1 by applying Proposition 5.4 to the min\u0002imal dA∞-algebra E described there. In this case, the sum representing γA con\u0002sists only of mE\r
21. The mE\r
21 cannot be a boundary in the complex computing the\r
derived Hochschild cohomology: p · mE\r
11 = 0, while p · mE21 is non-zero. Hence\r
γA ∈ dHH3,−1\r
Z/p2 (H∗A) is non-trivial.\r
This illustrates that the non-triviality of E is a consequence of the information\r
encoded in the higher degrees of the horizontal grading.\r
6. Anti-minimal models\r
The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2, which provides an ‘anti-minimal’\r
model of a dA∞-algebra. To this end, we introduce modules over dA∞-algebras\r
and show that the module category is enriched in twisted chain complexes. For a\r
dA∞-algebra E, we thus have an endomorphism tga of the E-module E. Its total\r
complex is a dga. If E is the minimal dA∞-algebra model of a dga A, this dga\r
associated with E recovers the quasi-isomorphism type of A. These constructions\r
are motivated by the Hom-complex of maps between modules over A∞-algebras

A map f : M → N of E-modules induces a map of twisted chain complexes\r
between the underlying twisted chain complexes of M and N. The map f is an\r
E2-equivalence if this underlying map is.\r
Example 6.9. If f : E → F is a map of dA∞-algebras, both E and F are E\u0002modules, and one can check that f is an E-module map. The underlying twisted\r
chain complexes of E and F as dA∞-algebras and modules coincide. Hence f is an\r
E2-equivalence of modules if and only if it is an E2-equivalence of dA∞-algebras.\r
Let E be a dA∞-algebra and let M and N be E-modules. Let X be the bigraded\r
k-module Homk(SM ⊗ T SE, SN). For s ∈ N, t ∈ Z, an element of Xst is a k\u0002module map ge\r

SN. As in the definition of module maps, the ge\r

Definition 6.10. Let E be a dA∞-algebra and let M and N be E-modules. We\r
define HomE(M, N) to be the twisted chain complex with underlying bigraded\r
k-module Homk(SM ⊗ T SE, SN) and differentials di as defined above.\r
Let L, M and N are E-modules. For fe∈ HomE(M, N)st and ge ∈ HomE(L, M)pq,\r
its composite fege ∈ HomE(L, M)p+s,q+t is defined. The unit k → HomE(M, M)\r
sends 1k to the ge ∈ HomE(M, M) with ge\r

j = 0 for j ≥ 2.\r
Proposition 6.11. The composition induces a pairing of twisted chain complexes\r
HomE(M, N) ⊗ HomE(L, M) → HomE(L, N)\r
which is associative and unital. In particular, HomE(M, M) is a tdga.\r
Proof. Let µ be the composition. The only possibly non-trivial part is to verify the\r

Remark 6.12. The last proposition says that the category of modules over a\r
dA∞-algebra is enriched in twisted chain complexes. The morphisms of the ordinary\r
category underlying this tChk-category are not the dA∞-algebra module morphisms\r
of Definition 6.8. Unlike the case of modules over A∞-algebras and their enrichment\r
in chain complexes, not even all components fij of an E-module map f are 0-cycles\r
in the HomE(M, N). The reason is that for i ≥ 1, the fij would have to lie in\r
a negative degree with respect to the first grading. We resist from allowing a\r
negative grading there, since this would for example cause problems when forming\r
total complexes. Therefore, the notation Hom might be slightly misleading, but we\r
keep it in lack of a better alternative. Moreover, the induced maps on HomE(M, N)\r
to be defined next are not a consequence of the enrichment.

f∗ : HomE(E, E) → HomE(E, F) is an E2-equivalence of twisted chain complexes\r
if and only if f is an E2-equivalence.\r
Proof. By Lemma 6.18, the maps induced by f∗ψ\r
E and ψE,F f on Hh\r

Corollary 6.21. The map f\r
∗\r
resf is an E2-equivalence of twisted chain complexes.\r
Proposition 6.22. Let f : E → F be an E2-equivalence of dA∞-algebras with E2-\r
homology concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Then the dgas Tot HomE(E, E) and\r
Tot HomF (F, F) are quasi-isomorphic.\r
Proof. By the Corollaries 6.19 and 6.21, there is a diagram\r
HomE(E, E)\r
f∗ −→ HomE(E, F)\r
f\r
∗\r
resf ←−−−− HomF (F, F)\r
with both maps E2-equivalences. Setting\r
R = Tot HomE(E, E), S = Tot HomF (F, F), and X = Tot HomE(E, F),\r
we obtain dgas R and S, an S-R-bimodule X, a quasi-isomorphism α: R → X of\r
right R-modules and an quasi-isomorphism β : S → X of left S-modules. This data\r
is compatible with the unit maps in that the square obtained from composing the\r
unit maps of R and S with α and β commutes.\r
The described data is almost a ‘quasi-equivalence’ of dgas as described in [12,\r
p.31] and generalized in [20, Definition A.2.1]. The missing part is an element of X\r
such that left and right multiplication with the element equals α and β, respectively\r
(compare Remark 6.12). However, we can follow closely the strategy of the proof of\r
[20, Lemma A.2.3], exploiting the (projective) model structures on Chk and Mod-R.\r
We factor α in the model category of right R-modules as a composition of an\r
acyclic cofibration α\r
0\r
: R / ∼ /Y and an acyclic fibration α\r
00 : Y\r
∼ //X . We con\u0002sider the dga T = HomR(Y, Y ), the T-R-bimodule V = HomR(R, Y ), and the S-T\u0002bimodule W = HomR(Y, X). The map α\r
0\r
induces an acyclic fibration (α\r
0\r
)\r
∗\r
: T → V\r
and a quasi-isomorphism (α\r
0\r
)∗ : R ∼= HomR(R, R) → V . The multiplications on R\r

) ← T are maps of dgas. They\r
are quasi-isomorphisms since (α\r

∗\r
is an acyclic fibration.\r
The α\r
00 induces an acyclic fibration (α00)∗ : T → W since Y is cofibrant as an\r
R-module. Right multiplication with α\r
00 induces a map S → W. It is a quasi-iso\u0002morphism since its composition with the quasi-isomorphism W = HomR(Y, X) →\r
HomR(R, X) ∼= X induced by α\r
0\r
equals β. The latter statement exploits the\r
compatibility of α and β with the units of R and S. As above, we form the pullback\r
to get a chain T → P(α\r
00) ← S of quasi-isomorphisms. \u0003\r
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let E be a dA∞-algebra. Lemma 2.18 and Proposition\r
6.11 show that Tot HomE(E, E) is a dga. If A is a dga and E → A an E2-\r
equivalence, Proposition 6.22 implies that Tot HomA(A, A) is quasi-isomorphic to

24 STEFFEN SAGAVE\r
Tot HomE(E, E). Applying Tot to the E1-equivalence A → HomA(A, A) and ob\u0002serving A ∼= Tot A completes the proof. \u0003\r
Over a field, every A∞-algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a dga. However, not\r
every dA∞-algebra E is E2-equivalent to a dga, since E may have E2-homology in\r
horizontal degrees other than 0. From this perspective, the relation of dgas and\r
dA∞-algebras is more like viewing ordinary modules as (positive) chain complexes\r
concentrated in degree 0.\r

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS\r
STEFFEN SAGAVE\r
Abstract. A differential graded algebra can be viewed as an A∞-algebra. By\r
a theorem of Kadeishvili, a dga over a field admits a quasi-isomorphism from\r
a minimal A∞-algebra. We introduce the notion of a derived A∞-algebra and\r
show that any dga A over an arbitrary commutative ground ring k is equivalent\r
to a minimal derived A∞-algebra. Such a minimal derived A∞-algebra model\r
for A is a k-projective resolution of the homology algebra of A together with\r
a family of maps satisfying appropriate relations.\r
As in the case of A∞-algebras, it is possible to recover the dga up to quasi\u0002isomorphism from a minimal derived A∞-algebra model. Hence the structure\r
we are describing provides a complete description of the quasi-isomorphism\r
type of the dga."""

An A∞-algebra over a commutative ring k is a Z-graded k-module A with struc\u0002ture maps mj : A⊗j → A[2 − j] satisfying certain relations. A∞-algebras were\r
introduced by Stasheff in the 1960’s [21]. We refer to Keller’s survey [13] for back\u0002ground and for references to the various applications A∞-algebras have found in\r
different fields of mathematics.\r
A differential graded algebra over k is an A∞-algebra with m1 the differential,\r
m2 the multiplication, and mj = 0 for j ≥ 3. If k is a field, a theorem of Kadeishvili\r
[11] asserts that every k-dga A admits a quasi-isomorphism of A∞-algebras from\r
a minimal A∞-algebra, where minimal means m1 = 0. The underlying graded\r
k-algebra of such a minimal model for A is the homology algebra H∗(A). The\r
quasi-isomorphism type of A can be recovered from its minimal model. There\u0002fore, minimal A∞-algebras provide an alternative description for quasi-isomorphism\r
classes of dgas [13, §3.3], and the minimal A∞-structure on H∗(A) specifies pre\u0002cisely the additional information needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type\r
of a dga from its homology [13, §2.1].\r
From now on let k be a commutative ring. Then the conclusion of Kadeishvili’s\r
theorem will in general not hold if the homology H∗(A) is not k-projective since\r
for example a k-linear cycle selection morphism may not exist.\r
The aim of the present paper is to generalize the notion of an A∞-algebra to\r
a context in which a dga A admits a minimal model without restrictions on k or\r
H∗(A), and thereby to provide a different description of the quasi-isomorphism type\r
of A.\r
Our approach is motivated by the following two observations. On the one hand,\r
A∞-algebras are closely related to Hochschild cohomology. For example, the m3\r

as Shukla cohomology. Following Baues and Pirashvili [1], the latter cohomology\r

There exists a k-projective minimal dA∞-algebra E together with an E2-equivalence\r
E → A of dA∞-algebras. This minimal dA∞-algebra model E of A is well defined\r
up to E2-equivalences between k-projective minimal dA∞-algebras. Particularly, the\r
bigraded k-module E together with the differential mE\r
11 and the multiplication mE\r
02\r
is a k-projective resolution of the graded k-algebra H∗(A).\r
The first step in the proof of the theorem is to construct a dA∞-algebra B with\r
mB\r
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3 together with a map B → A of dA∞-algebras such that the\r
induced map H∗(B, mB\r
01) → H∗(A) is a k-projective resolution. To find such a\r
B, we employ the cofibrant replacement in a resolution model category structure\r
on the category of simplicial dgas. The second step is to replace B by a minimal\r
dA∞-algebra, which is now possible since H∗(B, mB\r
01) is k-projective.\r
If E is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of the dga A, the sum mE\r
03+mE\r
12+mE\r
21 is a\r
cocycle in a complex computing the derived Hochschild cohomology of H∗(A). Its\r
cohomology class does not depend on the choice of the minimal model. This derived\r
Hochschild cohomology class γA ∈ dHH3,−1(H∗(A)) associated with A generalizes\r
the Hochschild cohomology class of a dga over a field studied by Benson, Krause,\r
and Schwede in [2]. For example, γA determines all triple matric Massey products\r
in H∗(A).\r
Let k = Z/p2 with p an odd prime, and let A be the dga which has a copy of\r
k in degrees 0 and 1 and multiplication by p as the differential A1 → A0. Then\r
H∗(A) is an exterior algebra over Fp on a class in degree one. In Example 5.1, we\r
describe a minimal dA∞-algebra model of A. The derived Hochschild cohomology\r
class γA defined by means of this minimal model is non-zero.\r
The information encoded in a minimal dA∞-algebra model is not restricted to\r
the resolution of H∗(A) and the triple Massey products. In fact, we can recover the\r
dga from a minimal dA∞-algebra model:\r
Theorem 1.2. For a dA∞-algebra E, there is an associated differential graded\r
algebra Tot HomE(E, E). If E is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of a dga A, the dga\r
Tot HomE(E, E) is quasi-isomorphic to A.\r
Therefore, we have given an answer to the question of which additional structure\r
is needed to reconstruct the quasi-isomorphism type of a dga over a commutative\r
ground ring from its homology algebra: A k-projective resolution of its homology\r
equipped with a minimal dA∞-algebra structure provides the necessary information.\r
A different approach to describe quasi-isomorphism types of dgas is to use Post\u0002nikov systems and k-invariants. This approach is used by Dugger and Shipley in

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 3\r
[4, §4] for their study of topological equivalences of dgas. One advantage of the\r
minimal dA∞-algebra structures introduced in the present paper is that they also\r
exist for dgas with homology in negative degrees.\r
One may apply our results to Ext-algebras. If M is a k-module, the Yoneda\u0002algebra Ext∗\r
k\r
(M, M) is the homology of the endomorphism dga Homk(P, P) of a k\u0002projective resolution P of M. Hence a minimal dA∞-algebra model for Homk(P, P)\r
provides a k-projective resolution of Ext∗\r
k\r
(M, M) with structure maps mij . This\r
structure is well defined up to E2-equivalence, and it reflects the quasi-isomorphism\r
type of Homk(P, P). We calculate it for Ext∗\r
Z\r
(Z/p, Z/p). This generalizes the\r
existence of a minimal A∞-structure on the extension algebra of a module over an\r
algebra over a field [13, §3.3].\r
Organization. In the second section, we define dA∞-algebras and explain how\r
they generalize A∞-algebras. We introduce bidgas and twisted dgas and define the\r
notion of E2-equivalence. In the third section, we explain how dgas can be resolved\r
by bidgas. This makes use of Bousfield’s theory of resolution model categories.\r
The fourth section features the proof of Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we define\r
the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with a dga and describe the\r
examples mentioned in the Introduction. In the sixth section, we introduce modules\r
over dA∞-algebras and use the enrichment of module categories in twisted chain\r
complexes to prove Theorem 1.2. The last section contains four lemmas needed in\r
Section 4.\r
Notation and conventions. Throughout the paper, k is a commutative ground\r
ring, and all tensor products are taken over k. We consider (N, Z)-bigraded k\u0002modules E = (Est)s∈N,t∈Z. Their shift is defined by E[i, j]st = Es−i,t−j . We\r
sometimes refer to the N-grading as the horizontal direction and to the Z-grading\r
as the vertical direction.\r
The tensor product of two bigraded k-modules E and F is the bigraded k-module\r
E ⊗ F with\r
(1.3) (E ⊗ F)uv =\r
M\r
i+p=u, j+q=v\r
Eij ⊗ Epq.\r
We follow the Kozul sign convention. For maps f : W → X[i, j], g : Y → Z[p, q]\r
and elements w ∈ Wst, y ∈ Yuv this means (f ⊗ g)(w ⊗ y) = (−1)hw,gif(w) ⊗ g(y)\r
with hw, gi = sp + tq. Similarly, we get (f ⊗ g)(f\r
0 ⊗ g0\r
) = (−1)hf\r
0\r
,giff0 ⊗ gg0\r
for\r
tensor products of composable maps. Tensor product, shift, and sign convention\r
for k-modules with a single Z-grading are given accordingly.\r
We assume familiarity with the basics about A∞-algebras, as for example de\u0002scribed in Section 3 of Keller’s survey [13]. In our sign convention for A∞-algebras,\r
we follow Lef`evre [14] and ask the structure maps\r
P\r
mj of an A∞-algebra to satisfy\r
(−1)rq+tmj (1\r
⊗r ⊗ mq ⊗ 1⊗t\r
) = 0. Remark 4.4 explains our choice of signs.\r
2. dA∞-algebras and twisted chain complexes\r
Our main object of study is the following generalization of an A∞-algebra whose\r
definition was already outlined in the Introduction.\r
Definition 2.1. A derived A∞-algebra (dA∞-algebra for short) is a (N, Z)-bigraded\r
k-module E with k-module maps mij : E⊗j → E[i, 2 − (i + j)] and a unit map\r

mE\r

mE\r
ij (1\r

(2.3)\r
Example 2.4. A derived A∞-algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 is the\r
same as a (strictly unital) A∞-algebra with the m0j as structure maps: the equa\u0002tions (2.2)uv for u = 0 are the A∞-relations. Since a k-dga A is a special instance\r
of an A∞-algebra, it is a dA∞-algebra concentrated in horizontal degree 0 for which\r

Example 2.9. Maps between dA∞-algebras concentrated in horizontal degree 0\r
are maps of A∞-algebras.\r
In Section 4, we will give an equivalent but more economic description of dA∞-\r
algebras and their maps in terms of a structure on the reduced tensor algebra of\r
E[0, 1]. Amongst others, we employ it to define the composition of dA∞-algebra\r
maps and the notion of a module over a dA∞-algebra, and it will also help to\r
explain the signs. We use the less streamlined Definition 2.1 here since both our\r
examples and our notion of equivalence fit in more naturally.\r
We single out an interesting special case of a dA∞-algebra:\r
Definition 2.10. A bidga is a dA∞-algebra B with mB\r
ij = 0 if i + j ≥ 3. A map\r
f : A → B of bidgas is a map of dA∞-algebras with fpq = 0 for p+q ≥ 2. We write\r
bidgakfor the resulting category.\r
Of course, dgas give rise to bidgas concentrated in horizontal degree 0.\r
Remark 2.11. The category bidgak admits a different description. Let biChk\r
be the category of (N, Z)-graded bicomplexes of k-modules. Objects are bigraded\r
k-modules E with differentials d0 : E → E[0, 1] and d1 : E → E[1, 0] satisfying\r
d0d0 = 0, d1d1 = 0, and d0d1 = d1d0. The tensor product of bigraded k-modules\r
induces a symmetric monoidal product on biChk. A monoid in biChk is a bicomplex\r
B with a multiplication µ: B ⊗ B → B satisfying associativity, two Leibniz rules,\r
and a unit condition. Setting mB\r
01 = d0, mB\r
11 = d1 and mB\r
02 = µ, we observe that\r
the six non-trivial formulas (2.2)uv for u + v ≤ 3 are the associativity law, the two\r
Leibniz rules, and the three identities for the differentials. After comparing the unit\r
conditions, we see that bidgakis the category of monoids in biChk. This is similar\r
to the characterization of dgas as the monoids in the category of chain complexes\r
with respect to the tensor product of chain complexes.

Definition 2.12. A twisted dga (tdga for short) is a dA∞-algebra T for which only\r
mT\r
02 and mT\r
i1 with i ≥ 0 may be non-zero. A map f : T → S of tdgas is a map of\r
dA∞-algebras with fpq = 0 if q ≥ 2. We write tdgakfor the resulting category.\r
Every bidga is a tdga. The name twisted dga is chosen in view of\r
Definition 2.13. [6] A twisted chain complex E is an (N, Z)-graded k-module with\r
differentials d\r

signs in Definition 2.13 differ from those in [6]. We explain our choice in Remark"""

Remark 2.16. Similarly as in Remark 2.11, the tensor product of graded modules\r
defines a symmetric monoidal product on tChk. Monoids in tChk are tgas. The\r
resulting composition tdga maps is of course a special case of the composition of\r
dA∞-algebra maps to be given in Definition 4.5.\r
Let E be a dA∞-algebra. Identifying (2.2)uv for v = 1 with (2.14)u, we see that\r
the mE\r
i1 with i ≥ 0 specify the underlying twisted chain complex of E. For a map\r
f : E → F of dA∞-algebras, the fi1 form a map of the underlying twisted chain\r
complexes. We thus occasionally write di for mE\r
i1 when we refer to the underlying\r
twisted chain complex of a dA∞-algebra E.\r
Remark 2.17. The underlying twisted chain complex is one instance in which\r
twisted chain complexes behave to dA∞-algebras as unbounded chain complexes\r
behave to A∞-algebras. This analogy turns out to be fruitful, and we frequently\r
exploit it in Sections 4 and 6.\r
Next we study the passage from twisted chain complexes to chain complexes.\r
There is a total complex functor\r
Tot: tChk → Chk, Totn X =\r
M\r
s+t=n\r
Xst,\r
where the differential d: Totn X → Totn−1 X is P\r

i≥0\r
fi of total complexes. This is well defined\r
since only finitely many d\r

i\r
or fileave a fixed Xst.\r
If we consider the total complex as a twisted chain complex concentrated in\r
horizontal degree 0, there is a map ρX : X → Tot X of twisted chain complexes. Its\r
component (ρX)i: X → (Tot X)[i, −i] is the inclusion of Xi∗ into (Tot X)[i, −i]i∗.\r
We can interpret ρ as a natural transformation from the identity on tChk to Tot.\r
The presence of this natural transformation is one advantage of the category of\r
twisted chain complexes over the category of bicomplexes.\r
Lemma 2.18. The functor Tot: tChk → Chk is strongly monoidal, and ρ is a\r
strong monoidal transformation. In particular, if E is a tdga, then Tot E is a dga,\r
and ρE : E → Tot E is a map of tdgas."""

The aim of this section is to construct resolutions of dgas that induce resolutions\r
of their graded homology algebras. We saw that a dga can be considered as a bidga\r
concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Particularly, a graded k-algebra is a bidga\r
concentrated in horizontal degree 0 with both differentials trivial.\r
Definition 3.1. A termwise k-projective resolution of a graded algebra Λ is a\r
termwise k-projective bidga E with trivial vertical differential together with an\r
E2-equivalence E → Λ of bidgas.\r
Here we think of a bidga with trivial vertical differential as a differential graded\r
algebra in graded algebras. If E → Λ is a termwise k-projective resolution, E∗,0 is\r
a dga which is k-projective and whose homology is isomorphic to Λ0 concentrated\r
in degree 0. In other words, a termwise k-projective resolution is the graded analog\r
of the resolution of a k-algebra by a degreewise k-projective dga.\r
If the graded algebra is the homology of a differential graded algebra, we can ask\r
even more:\r
Definition 3.2. Let A be a k-dga. A k-projective E1-resolution of A is a bidga B\r
together with an E2-equivalence B → A of bidgas such that Hv\r
st(B) is k-projective\r
and the map k → Hv\r
00(B) induced by the unit k → B splits as a k-module map.\r
A termwise k-projective E1-resolution of a dga A is a termwise k-projective\r
resolution of the graded algebra Hv\r
∗\r
(A) which is induced from a resolution of the\r
dga and satisfies an additional unit condition.\r
Example 3.3. Let p be an odd prime and k = Z/p2. The k-dga A = Λ∗\r
Z/p2 (w)\r
with |w| = 1 and d(w) = p is non-formal and has homology Λ∗\r
Fp\r
(w) with |w| = 1.\r
It is also considered in [1, §5.2]. We will give a k-projective E1-resolution of A.\r
Consider the (N, Z)-bigraded k-algebra\r
V = k[a, b, u, v]/(a\r

with |a| = |b| = (0, 0) and |u| = |v| = (0, 1). We set d\r
V\r
0\r
(u) = a and d\r
V\r
0\r
(v) = b. This\r
extends uniquely to a differential on V . We think of V as a dga concentrated in

The multiplications on V and H turn B into a bigraded k-algebra. Since d\r
H\r
0 = 0\r
for degree reasons, the d\r
V\r
0 on V induces a vertical differential d\r
B\r

(xyi) = (p − pa + b)yi and d\r
B\r
1\r
(yi) = (p − b − ab)xyi−1,\r
where yiis the divided power algebra generator in degree 2i. The d\r
B\r

is linear with\r

A map of bidgas α: B → A is defined by setting\r
α(y0) = 1, α(a) = p, α(b) = −p, α(u) = w, and α(v) = −w.\r
This is multiplicative and compatible with the relations among a, b, u, and v. Since\r

The proof of the theorem occupies the rest of the section. It uses Quillen’s\r
language of model categories [15, 9]. The point is to use the cofibrant replacement\r
in an appropriate model structure on the category sdgak of simplicial dgas.\r
We start by briefly recalling Bousfield’s general setup for resolution model struc\u0002tures [3], or rather the dual version of [10]. Let C be a pointed model category.\r
Let P be a class of group-objects in Ho(C). A morphism p: X → Y in Ho(C) is a\r
P-epi if p∗ : [P, X]n → [P, Y ]n is onto for every P ∈ P and n ≥ 0, where [X, Y ]n =\r
Ho(C)(ΣnX, Y ). An object A ∈ Ho(C) is P-projective if p∗ : [A, X]n → [A, Y ]n is\r
onto for all P-epis p and n ≥ 0. Maps in C (resp. objects in C) are P-epis (resp.\r
P-projective) if they are in Ho(C). A map in C is a P-projective cofibration if it\r
has the left lifting property with respect to all P-epi fibrations. A map X → Y in\r
C is P-free if it is a composition of an inclusion X → X\r
`\r
P with P cofibrant and\r
P-projective and an acyclic cofibration X\r
`\r
P → Y . We say that Ho(C) has enough\r
P-projectives if every object X ∈ Ho(C) admits a P-epi Y → X with P-projective\r
source. In this case, we call P a class of projective models in Ho(C).\r
The next definition makes use of the standard model structure on the category\r
of simplicial groups ([15, II.3.7]), the Reedy model structure on sC [7, VII.2.12],\r
and the notion of the latching object LnX and its structure map LnX → Xn for\r

Theorem 3.6. [3, Theorem 3.3] Let C be a right proper pointed model category\r
and let P be a class of projective models for Ho(C). With the above P-equivalences,\r
P-fibrations, and P-cofibrations, sC becomes a right proper model category. It is\r
simplicial with respect to the external simplicial structure.\r
We frequently use the following feature of this model structure:\r
Lemma 3.7. A P-cofibration in sC is termwise a P-projective cofibration in C.\r
Proof. This is a consequence of [8, Lemma 15.3.9], compare [3, Lemma 5.3]. \u0003\r
Our main example is the category Chk with the projective model structure [9,\r
Theorem 2.3.11]. Since Chk is stable, all objects in Ho(Chk) are cogroup objects.\r
Let P be the set of objects {S\r
n(k)|n ∈ Z} in Ho(Chk) = D(k), where Sn(k)i = k\r
if i = n and 0 otherwise. The P-epis are the maps which induce surjections in\r
homology.\r
Lemma 3.8. With this P, the category Ho(Chk) has enough P-projectives. An\r
object in Ho(Chk) is P-projective if and only if it has degreewise k-projective ho\u0002mology.\r
Proof. Since every object is the codomain of a P-epi mapping out of a sum of\r
objects in P, there are enough P-projectives. Applying this to a P-projective object\r
X shows that X is a retract of a sum of objects in P. Hence X has degreewise\r
k-projective homology. On the other hand, an object with degreewise k-projective\r
homology is a retract of a sum of objects of P, and therefore P-projective. \u0003\r
All objects in Chk are fibrant, so Chk is right proper. Theorem 3.6 yields the\r
P-model structure on sChk.\r
Analogous to the classical case of simplicial abelian groups and simplicial rings,\r
simplicial dgas can be considered as the monoids in the category sChk of simplicial\r
chain complexes with respect to the termwise tensor product.\r
Proposition 3.9. The forgetful functor U : sdgak → sChk creates a cofibrantly\r
generated model structure on sdgakin which a map f is a P-fibration or a P\u0002equivalence if U(f) is. Cofibrant objects in sdgak are termwise P-projective cofi\u0002brant in Chk. The unit map of a cofibrant replacement in sdgak\r
splits in homology.\r
Proof. First notice that the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated.\r
To obtain the generating cofibrations I and generating acyclic cofibrations J, one\r
has to add the generating acyclic cofibrations of the Reedy model structure [8,\r
Proposition 15.6.24] to the two sets of maps described in [10, Lemma 2.7].\r
The projective model structure on Chk creates a model structure on dgak[18,\r
§5], which gives rise to a Reedy model structure on sdgak. As the matching object\r
functor is defined as a limit and the forgetful functor U commutes with limits, a\r
map f in sdgakis a Reedy fibration or a Reedy weak equivalence if and only if\r
U(f) is.\r
Since all objects in simplicial abelian groups are fibrant, the P-fibrant objects in\r
sChk coincide with the Reedy fibrant objects. Therefore, the Reedy fibrant replace\u0002ment functor in sdgak\r
is a fibrant replacement functor for the P-model structure\r
to be constructed.\r
The cotensor of the external simplicial structure on sChk is defined as a limit [7,\r
p. 371] and therefore extends to a functor\r
homsdgak: S\r
op × sdgak → sdgak\r
.\r
As the P-model structure on sChk is simplicial, homsdgak(−, Y ) maps weak equiv\u0002alences to P-equivalences and cofibrations to P-fibrations provided Y is P-fibrant.

DG-ALGEBRAS AND DERIVED A∞-ALGEBRAS 9\r
Hence the simplicial path object for a fibrant object qualifies as a path object for\r
the P-model structure on sdgak we are heading for.\r
Since the P-model structure on sChk is cofibrantly generated, the verification\r
of the axioms for the P-model structure on sdgak now follows from applying [18,\r
Lemma 2.3(2)] to the left adjoint of U. As in Quillen’s original argument [15,\r
II.4.9], one can reduce the assumptions to presence of a path object and the fibrant\r
replacement functor as established above.\r
The generating cofibrations T(I) of the P-model structure on sdgak are obtained\r
by applying the free associative algebra functor T to I. If X is P-projective and\r
cofibrant, −⊗X preserves P-free maps. Cobase change also preserves P-free maps.\r
The maps in I are either termwise acyclic cofibrations in the projective model\r
structure on Chk, or termwise of the form X → X\r
`\r
P with P ∈ P. By the careful\r
analysis of the free associative algebra functor carried out in [18, Lemma 6.2], it\r
follows that for a termwise P-projective cofibrant X in sdgak, the map X → Y\r
obtained from attaching a generating cofibration f ∈ T(I) to X is is isomorphic\r
to the inclusion of X into the colimit of a countable sequence of termwise P-free\r
maps: inspecting the proof the second statement of the cited lemma, we see that\r
it is enough to provide the last four statements and Lemma 3.10.\r
The initial object of sdgakis itself termwise P-projective. Hence the map from\r
the initial object k to a cofibrant replacement constructed by means of the small\r
object argument applied to T(I) is termwise a transfinite composition of P-free\r
maps. Therefore, it splits in homology. In particular, any cofibrant replacement is\r
termwise P-projective cofibrant. By the retract argument, all cofibrant objects are\r
termwise P-projective cofibrant. \u0003\r
Let f : X → Y and g : X0 → Y\r
0 be maps in Chk or sChk. We define the pushout\r
product map f\u0003g to be the induced map Y ⊗ X0 `\r
X⊗X0 X ⊗ Y\r
0 → Y ⊗ Y0\r
.\r
Lemma 3.10. Let K be the class of termwise acyclic cofibrations in sChk, and let\r
L be the class of maps in sChk which are termwise of the form X → X\r
`\r
P with\r
P a P-projective cofibrant object. Then (K ∪ L)\u0003(K ∪ L) ⊂ (K ∪ L).\r
Proof. The pushout product axiom [19, Definition 3.1] holds in Chk. It states\r
that if f and g are cofibrations in Chk, then the pushout product map f\u0003g is a\r
cofibration which is acyclic if f or g is. The axiom immediately implies K\u0003K ⊂ K.\r
Since objects in P are cofibrant, it also shows that for P ∈ P and f ∈ K, the map\r
P ⊗ f is again in K. This argument implies K\u0003L ∪ L\u0003K ⊂ K. If both maps are\r
in L, it is enough to show that for two P-projective cofibrant objects P, P0 ∈ P,\r
their product P ⊗P\r
0\r
is P-projective cofibrant. Cofibrancy is clear. Since both have\r
k-projective homology, the E2-term of the bicomplex spectral sequence computing\r
the homology of P ⊗ P\r
0\r
consists only of a single non-trivial line in which all entries\r
are k-projective. By Lemma 3.8, P ⊗ P\r
0\r
is P-cofibrant. \u0003\r
We need an instance of the Dold-Kan correspondence to go back and forth be\u0002tween simplicial chain complexes and bicomplexes. The version in [7, III Theorem\r
2.5] is sufficiently general to apply to our context.\r
The associated chain complex and normalized chain complex are functors\r
C : sChk → biChk and N : sChk → biChk .\r
The first is defined by C(X)s∗ = Xs with horizontal differential given by the al\u0002ternating sum of the simplicial face maps, and N(X) is the quotient of C(X) by\r
the subobject generated by the image of the degeneracies. The functor N is an\r
equivalence of categories. Its inverse Γ: biChk → sChk can be defined by\r

with the simplicial structure maps described on [7, p. 148].\r
The monoidal properties of these functors are as in the classical case discussed\r
in [19, §2.3,§2.4]. We have a shuffle map ∇ and the Alexander-Whitney map AW,\r
∇: CX ⊗ CY → C(X ⊗ Y ) and AW : C(X ⊗ Y ) → CX ⊗ CY,\r
∇ is a lax monoidal transformation, AW is a lax comonoidal transformation, and\r
both maps preserve the subcomplexes of degenerate simplicies and induce\r
∇: NX ⊗ NY → N(X ⊗ Y ) and AW : N(X ⊗ Y ) → NX ⊗ NY.\r
For a simplicial dga X, the associated chain complex of the underlying simplicial\r
chain complex is a bidga with multiplication defined by\r
CX ⊗ CX ∇−→ C(X ⊗ X) → C(X).\r
Similarly, NX is a bidga. For a bidga B, the Alexander-Whitney map induces the\r
structure of a simplicial dga on Γ(B) [19, (2.9)]. As explained in [19, Remark 2.14],\r
the functors Γ and N do not induce an equivalence between sdgak and bidgak, due\r
to the failure of the unit of the adjunction to be monoidal. However, the adjunction\r
counit isomorphism NΓ ∼= idbiChk\r
is monoidal on the level of complexes [19, Lemma\r
2.11], which is sufficient for our purposes.\r
Lemma 3.11. (i) The functor C maps P-equivalences of simplicial dgas to E2-\r
equivalences of bidgas.\r
(ii) For a k-bidga B, there is a canonical E2-equivalence C(Γ(B)) → B of bidgas\r
which is natural in B.\r
Proof. It is enough to check (i) additively. Since C commutes with taking verti\u0002cal homology, the assertion follows from the definition of P-equivalences and E2-\r
equivalences.\r
The map in (ii) is the one inducing the counit N(Γ(B)) → B. It is a map of\r
bidgas since the counit is monoidal and the shuffle map is compatible with the\r
degeneracies. Both C and Γ (but not N) commute with taking vertical homology,\r
so the Dold-Kan correspondence for simplicial k-modules and Ch+\r
k\r
applied in each\r
vertical degree shows that C(Γ(B)) → B is an E2-equivalence. \u0003\r
Proof of Theorem 3.4. We consider Γ(A), the constant simplicial dga A, and its\r
cofibrant replacement Γ(A)\r
cof. Lemma 3.8 and Proposition 3.9 show that Γ(A)cof\r
has k-projective vertical homology. The unit is the composite k → C(Γ(k)) →\r
C(Γ(A)\r
cof), which splits in vertical homology by the last part of Proposition 3.9.\r
Lemma 3.11 then shows that the composite\r
C(Γ(A)\r
cof) → C(Γ(A)) → A\r
is a k-projective E1-resolution. The second statement is the A = A0case of the\r
next lemma. \u0003\r

|me\r

by comparing the last lemma with Definition 2.5, this reduces the complexity of\r
signs considerably. Because of this, we will frequently switch to the me ij for explicit\r
calculations.\r
However, there is still a choice behind our sign convention. For example, one\r
may omit the sign in the definition of twisted chain complexes. This would change\r
the sign in the definition of dA∞-algebras and, in turn, the sign in the Leibniz rule\r
for bidgas. This would be in conflict with the signs resulting from the Dold-Kan\r
correspondence relating biChk and sdgak. In other words, our sign convention is\r
chosen to ensure that the chain complex associated to a simplicial dga is a dA∞-\r
algebra.\r
At this point we can also make up the promised definition of the composition of\r

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Given a k-dga A, we apply Theorem 3.4 to obtain a k\u0002projective E1-resolution B → A. Then B satisfies the assumptions of Proposition\r

The resolution B → A is well defined up to E2-equivalence of k-projective E1-\r

E2-equivalence E → F between the associated minimal dA∞-algebras. \u0003\r

Corollary 4.13. Minimal dA∞-algebra models of quasi-isomorphic dgas may be\r

Remark 4.14. We do not claim that every termwise k-projective resolution E of\r
H∗(A) may be extended to a minimal dA∞-algebra model for A. We only show\r
that this happens if E is the vertical homology of a bidga resolving A.

In this section, we give two examples for minimal dA∞-algebra structures and\r
apply our theory to define the derived Hochschild cohomology class associated with\r
a dga.\r
Example 5.1. Let p be an odd prime, k = Z/p2, and A the dga (k\r
·p\r

Example 3.3, we gave a k-projective E1-resolution B → A with E := Hv\r

E\r
1\r
to a dA∞-algebra structure on E. A cycle selection map f01 can\r
be defined by extending\r
f01(z) = au, f01(x) = x, and f01(yi) = yi\r
multiplicatively. Then f01mE\r
02 − mB\r
02(f01 ⊗ f01) = 0. Consequently, mE\r
03 = 0, and\r
we can set f02 = 0 and f03 = 0. Since mE\r
11 = d\r
E\r
1\r
, we define f11 : E → B[1, −1] by\r
f11(yi) = (v + av)xyi−1 and f11(x yi\r
) = (pu − v)yi.\r
The mE\r
12 is represented by\r
z12 = f11mE\r
02 − mB\r
02(f01 ⊗ f11 + f11 ⊗ f01).\r
One calculates z12 = 0, hence mE\r
12 = 0 and we can set f12 = 0. The mE\r
21 is\r
represented by z21 = f11mE\r
11 + mB\r
11f11. One checks\r
mE\r
21(yi\r
) = z yi−1 and mE\r
21(x yi\r
) = z x yi−1.\r
Furthermore, we set f21(x yi) = puvxyi−1 and f21(yi) = 0. The mE\r
ij and fij for\r
i + j ≥ 4 vanish for degree reasons.\r
Example 5.7 below provides one way to detect that this E encodes non-trivial\r
information about A, for example the fact that A is not quasi-isomorphic to the\r
formal dga H∗(A) with trivial differential. Of course, Theorem 1.2 provides a\r
different reason this.\r
The example indicates the general procedure for finding a minimal dA∞-algebra\r
model of a given dga A. Since the resolutions provided by Theorem 3.4 are too\r
large to write down in terms of generators and relations, one has to first guess a k\u0002projective E1-resolution, for example by lifting a k-projective resolution of H∗(A)\r
to a bidga B coming with an E2-equivalence B → A. Then one can use the\r
constructive procedure of Proposition 4.7 to build E from B.\r
Remark 5.2. If k happens to be a field or, more generally, H∗(A) is k-projective\r
and the unit k → H0(A) splits, the minimal model of A as an A∞-algebra arising\r
from [11, Theorem 1] is one possible choice for the minimal dA∞-algebra model of\r
Theorem 1.1.\r
Let M be a k-module and let P be a k-projective resolution of M. The endomor\u0002phism dga Homk(P, P) is defined by Homk(P, P)j = Homk(P[j], P), where the lat\u0002ter denotes maps of graded k-modules. Its differential is d\r
Hom\r
j\r
(f) = d\r
P f−(−1)jf dP .\r
The quasi-isomorphism type of Homk(P, P) does not depend on the choice of the\r
resolution P. Its homology algebra is the Yoneda Ext-algebra of M with a sign\r
shift in the degree, i.e., H∗ Homk(P, P) = Ext−∗\r
k\r
(M, M).\r
A minimal dA∞-model for Homk(P, P) is a resolution E of Ext∗\r
k\r

structure maps mE\r

21 is a cocycle in the complex computing\r
HH3,−1(E, E) = dHH3,−1(H∗(A)). Its cohomology class γA ∈ dHH3,−1(H∗A) does\r
not depend on the choice of E.\r
Proof. The four formulas (2.2)uv with u + v = 4 for the mE\r
ij can be expressed\r
as dHH(mE\r
03) = 0, dHH(mE12) + dHom(mE03) = 0, dHH(mE21) + dHom(mE12) = 0, and\r
dHom(mE\r
21) = 0. Hence dTot(mE\r
03 + mE\r
12 + mE\r
21) = 0.\r
Let f : E → F be an E2-equivalence of minimal dA∞-algebras. We check that the\r
elements (f01)∗(mE\r
03 + mE12 + mE21) and (f01)\r
∗\r
(mF\r
03 + mF12 + mF21) of Tot3,−1 C(E, F)\r
represent the same cohomology class. Since f is map of dA∞-algebras , it satisfies\r
the relations (2.6)uv for u + v = 3, and these can be rewritten as\r

If a dga A is formal, i.e., quasi-isomorphic to H∗(A) with trivial differential,\r

Remark 5.5. For a dga over a field, there is a characteristic Hochschild cohomology\r
class γA ∈ HH3,−1(H∗(A)) which is studied in [2]. It is represented by the m3 of\r
a minimal A∞-algebra structure on H∗(A) and determines by evaluation all triple\r
matric Massey products in H∗(A). The characteristic dHH-class of a dga over a\r
commutative ring k given by the previous proposition is the natural generalization.\r
If k happens to be a field, the γA introduced here coincides with the one from [2],\r
as one can easily see from Remark 5.2 and [2, Remark 5.8].\r
If B is a bidga and B → A an E2-equivalence, B0∗ is a dga, and B → A restricts\r
to a map B0∗ → A of dgas which induces an surjection in homology. If E is the\r
minimal dA∞-algebra structure on Hv\r
∗\r
(B), the restriction of mE\r
03 to H∗(B0∗) is\r
part of an A∞-structure on H∗(B0∗). By evaluation, it determines triple Massey\r
products of B0∗. Moreover, if λ1, λ2, λ3 ∈ H∗(A) satisfy λ1λ2 = 0 = λ2λ3, we\r
may lift them to elements of H∗(B0∗), evaluate mE\r
03 on the lifts, and observe that\r
the image of the evaluation under the map to H∗(A) is an element of the Massey\r
product hλ1, λ2, λ3i. Hence the dHH-class determines all triple (matric) Massey\r
products in H∗(A). The difference to the HH-class of [2] is that the dHH-class does\r
not determine the Massey products in a k-linear fashion, since lifts of elements\r
along a surjection into a not necessarily projective k-module are involved.\r
We expect the dHH-class γA of a dga to share more properties with the HH-class\r
of [2], like the connection to realizability obstructions. We are not going to elaborate\r
those here. The dHH-class should also be compared to the universal Toda bracket\r
of a ring spectrum studied in [16]. The latter class is an even further generalization\r
of the (derived) Hochschild class and arises when one allows the sphere spectrum\r
of stable homotopy theory as ground ring. This class is an element in a Mac Lane\r
cohomology group and determines triple Toda brackets.\r
Remark 5.6. Derived Hochschild cohomology classes associated to dgas also ap\u0002pear in [1] and [4]: a dga A with only A0 and A1 possibly non-zero gives rise\r
to a crossed extension of H0(A) by H1(A) and hence to a cohomology class in\r
dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)) [1, 4.4.1. Theorem]. More generally, for a dga A with non\u0002negative homology, its first k-invariant lies in dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)) [4, §4].\r
If E → A is a minimal dA∞-algebra model of A, E∗0 is a k-projective resolution\r
of H0(A), and there is a restriction map dHH3,−1\r
k\r
(H∗(A)) → dHH3\r
k\r
(H0(A), H1(A)).\r
One can check that the image of γA under this map recovers the cohomology classes\r
described above.\r

The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 1.2, which provides an ‘anti-minimal’\r
model of a dA∞-algebra. To this end, we introduce modules over dA∞-algebras\r
and show that the module category is enriched in twisted chain complexes. For a\r
dA∞-algebra E, we thus have an endomorphism tga of the E-module E. Its total\r
complex is a dga. If E is the minimal dA∞-algebra model of a dga A, this dga\r
associated with E recovers the quasi-isomorphism type of A. These constructions\r
are motivated by the Hom-complex of maps between modules over A∞-algebras

A map f : M → N of E-modules induces a map of twisted chain complexes\r
between the underlying twisted chain complexes of M and N. The map f is an\r
E2-equivalence if this underlying map is.\r
Example 6.9. If f : E → F is a map of dA∞-algebras, both E and F are E\u0002modules, and one can check that f is an E-module map. The underlying twisted\r
chain complexes of E and F as dA∞-algebras and modules coincide. Hence f is an\r
E2-equivalence of modules if and only if it is an E2-equivalence of dA∞-algebras.\r
Let E be a dA∞-algebra and let M and N be E-modules. Let X be the bigraded\r
k-module Homk(SM ⊗ T SE, SN). For s ∈ N, t ∈ Z, an element of Xst is a k\u0002module map ge\r

Let L, M and N are E-modules. For fe∈ HomE(M, N)st and ge ∈ HomE(L, M)pq,\r

Proposition 6.11. The composition induces a pairing of twisted chain complexes\r

Remark 6.12. The last proposition says that the category of modules over a\r
dA∞-algebra is enriched in twisted chain complexes. The morphisms of the ordinary\r
category underlying this tChk-category are not the dA∞-algebra module morphisms\r
of Definition 6.8. Unlike the case of modules over A∞-algebras and their enrichment\r
in chain complexes, not even all components fij of an E-module map f are 0-cycles\r
in the HomE(M, N). The reason is that for i ≥ 1, the fij would have to lie in\r
a negative degree with respect to the first grading. We resist from allowing a\r
negative grading there, since this would for example cause problems when forming\r
total complexes. Therefore, the notation Hom might be slightly misleading, but we\r
keep it in lack of a better alternative. Moreover, the induced maps on HomE(M, N)\r
to be defined next are not a consequence of the enrichment.

Lemma 6.17. The map ψM,E of Lemma 6.16 is an E1-equivalence.\r

h be the composite SE ⊗ T SE[0, 1] ∼= Sk ⊗ SE ⊗ T SE → SE ⊗ T SE given by\r

Corollary 6.19. Let f : E → F be a map of dA∞-algebras. The induced map\r
f∗ : HomE(E, E) → HomE(E, F) is an E2-equivalence of twisted chain complexes\r
if and only if f is an E2-equivalence.\r
Proof. By Lemma 6.18, the maps induced by f∗ψ\r
E and ψE,F f on Hh\r

coincide.\r
Both ψ\r
E and ψE,F are E1-equivalences by Lemma 6.17, and hence E2-equivalences.\r

Lemma 6.20. Let f : E → F be a dA∞-algebra map. Then ψ\r
F,E and f∗\r
resf ψ\r
F,F\r

Corollary 6.21. The map f\r
∗\r
resf is an E2-equivalence of twisted chain complexes.\r
Proposition 6.22. Let f : E → F be an E2-equivalence of dA∞-algebras with E2-\r
homology concentrated in horizontal degree 0. Then the dgas Tot HomE(E, E) and\r
Tot HomF (F, F) are quasi-isomorphic.\r
Proof. By the Corollaries 6.19 and 6.21, there is a diagram\r
HomE(E, E)\r
f∗ −→ HomE(E, F)\r
f\r
∗\r
resf ←−−−− HomF (F, F)\r
with both maps E2-equivalences. Setting\r
R = Tot HomE(E, E), S = Tot HomF (F, F), and X = Tot HomE(E, F),\r
we obtain dgas R and S, an S-R-bimodule X, a quasi-isomorphism α: R → X of\r
right R-modules and an quasi-isomorphism β : S → X of left S-modules. This data\r
is compatible with the unit maps in that the square obtained from composing the\r
unit maps of R and S with α and β commutes.\r
The described data is almost a ‘quasi-equivalence’ of dgas as described in [12,\r
p.31] and generalized in [20, Definition A.2.1]. The missing part is an element of X\r
such that left and right multiplication with the element equals α and β, respectively\r
(compare Remark 6.12). However, we can follow closely the strategy of the proof of\r
[20, Lemma A.2.3], exploiting the (projective) model structures on Chk and Mod-R.\r
We factor α in the model category of right R-modules as a composition of an\r
acyclic cofibration α\r
0\r
: R / ∼ /Y and an acyclic fibration α\r
00 : Y\r
∼ //X . We con\u0002sider the dga T = HomR(Y, Y ), the T-R-bimodule V = HomR(R, Y ), and the S-T\u0002bimodule W = HomR(Y, X). The map α\r
0\r
induces an acyclic fibration (α\r
0\r
)\r
∗\r
: T → V\r
and a quasi-isomorphism (α\r
0\r
)∗ : R ∼= HomR(R, R) → V . The multiplications on R\r
and T induce an associative and unital multiplication on the pullback P(α\r
0\r
) of (α\r
0\r
)∗\r
and (α\r
0\r
)\r
∗\r
. Hence the induced maps from R → P(α\r
0\r
) ← T are maps of dgas. They\r
are quasi-isomorphisms since (α\r
0\r
)\r
∗\r
is an acyclic fibration.\r
The α\r
00 induces an acyclic fibration (α00)∗ : T → W since Y is cofibrant as an\r
R-module. Right multiplication with α\r
00 induces a map S → W. It is a quasi-iso\u0002morphism since its composition with the quasi-isomorphism W = HomR(Y, X) →\r
HomR(R, X) ∼= X induced by α\r
0\r
equals β. The latter statement exploits the\r
compatibility of α and β with the units of R and S. As above, we form the pullback\r
to get a chain T → P(α\r
00) ← S of quasi-isomorphisms. \u0003\r
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Let E be a dA∞-algebra. Lemma 2.18 and Proposition\r
6.11 show that Tot HomE(E, E) is a dga. If A is a dga and E → A an E2-\r
equivalence, Proposition 6.22 implies that Tot HomA(A, A) is quasi-isomorphic to"""

Tot HomE(E, E). Applying Tot to the E1-equivalence A → HomA(A, A) and ob\u0002serving A ∼= Tot A completes the proof. \u0003\r
Over a field, every A∞-algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a dga. However, not\r
every dA∞-algebra E is E2-equivalent to a dga, since E may have E2-homology in\r
horizontal degrees other than 0. From this perspective, the relation of dgas and\r
