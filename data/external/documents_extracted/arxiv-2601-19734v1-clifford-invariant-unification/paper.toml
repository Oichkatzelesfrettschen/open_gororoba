Abstract\r
A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and struc\u0002ture of gravity, Yang–Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms including\r
ghost freedom in the gravitational sector without tuning. Our results es\u0002tablish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra\r
dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge–gravity\r
constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from\r
a single Clifford–algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.\r
1 Introduction\r
Two long–standing frontiers in theoretical physics aim at unifying the funda\u0002mental interactions: embedding the gauge structure of the Standard Model\r
(SM) within a single algebraic framework, and reformulating gravity as a gauge\r
theory. Each faces major challenges on its own, and combining them within a\r
coherent framework has remained elusive. In this work we show that a single\r
Clifford–algebraic invariant is sufficient to fix, simultaneously and without tun\u0002ing, the dynamics of gravity, Yang–Mills fields, and fermions, while selecting a\r
ghost-free quadratic gravity sector.\r
Grand unified theories (GUTs) embed the SM group SU(3)× SU(2)×U(1)\r
into a simple symmetry such as SU(5), SO(10), orE\r

representation of SO(10) elegantly accommodates one SM family plus a right\u0002handed neutrino in a single 16-dimensional representation. Larger exceptional\r
groups further extend this structure, linking to neutrino mass generation and\r
charge quantization, but face persistent phenomenological issues such as pro\u0002ton decay and doublet–triplet splitting. In parallel, algebraic programs have\r
explored whether the SM gauge and matter content could emerge naturally\r
from deeper mathematical structures such as division algebras and Clifford\r
modules. In particular, the octonions O, whose automorphism group is G2,\r
connect to exceptional Lie algebras through the Freudenthal–Tits magic square\r
and encode one SM generation’s quantum numbers within minimal ideals of\r
C⊗H⊗O [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These algebraic schemes are mathematically rigid and\r
aesthetically appealing, yet a fully predictive model encompassing dynamics,\r
symmetry breaking, and fermion masses remains unrealized.\r
In parallel, gauge-theoretic formulations of gravity recast Einstein’s theory\r
in first-order form using the tetrad e\r
a\r
µ and spin connection ω\r
ab\r
µ [8]. Early\r
works by Utiyama, Sciama, Kibble, Hayashi and Nakano, and later Hehl, es\u0002tablished that while local Lorentz symmetry can be treated as a gauge group,\r
the resulting actions differ from Yang–Mills theories because the tetrad does\r
not transform as a connection [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Attempts to extend\r
the gauge principle to the full Poincar´e or (A)dS groups face degeneracies\r
in the algebra’s Cartan–Killing metric that render translational components\r
non-dynamical [15, 16]. Weyl’s early generalization of the Dirac equation to\r
curved spacetime showed that spinors intrinsically require a Lorentz gauge struc\u0002ture [17]. Later, the MacDowell–Mansouri construction framed gravity as a\r
symmetry-breaking gauge theory with an algebraic dual operator selecting the\r
Lorentz-invariant sector [18, 19].\r
The repeated emergence of Clifford algebras across grand unification, alge\u0002braic models, and gauge formulations of gravity suggests a common geometric\r
foundation. Building on this observation, previous work proposed that imple\u0002menting supersymmetry in the adjoint representation yields unified actions of\r
the form\r
S =\r
Z\r
⟨ F ⊛ F ⟩, (1)\r
where F is the field strength and ⊛ a generalized dual operator . However, that\r
construction defined ⊛ only for two-forms in four dimensions, limiting its scope.\r
Notably, skewsymmetric products of Clifford-algebra–valued frames naturally\r
reproduce the same invariant structures via the Hodge dual.\r
Here we show that a single action built from a Clifford-algebra–valued cur\u0002vature and an induced dual operator simultaneously reproduces the canonical\r
kinetic terms of gravity, Yang–Mills fields, and spin- 1\r
2\r
fermions. Remarkably,\r
within the restricted space of quadratic invariants generated by this construc\u0002tion, a known ghost-free quadratic gravity theory with propagating torsion,\r
originally identified by Sezgin, emerges without fine tuning. The cancellation\r
of higher-derivative fermionic terms follows from the same algebraic structure,\r
indicating that the framework is not a reformulation of gauge gravity but a\r
genuinely constrained geometric unification.\r

2 Construction of quadratic invariants\r
Let us begin by defining the field strength associated with the Lorentz algebra\r
as\r
F =\r
1\r
2\r
F\r
abJab , (2)\r
where F\r
ab are the Lorentz components of the curvature two-form and define the\r
corresponding field strength as\r
F = dA + A A , (3)\r
where wedge product is implied between differential forms. We shall work in\r
the spin- 1\r
2\r
representation of the Lorentz generators, Jab = Σab, which may be\r
realized as elements of the Clifford algebra. Explicitly,\r
Σab =\r
1\r
2\r
γab , (4)\r
where γab ≡\r
1\r
2\r
[γa, γb] denotes the skewsymmetric product of gamma matrices.\r
The main result of this paper is that implementing the Lorentz components\r
of the curvature and a Clifford–valued frame to construct quadratic invariants\r
of the form,\r
⟨ F ∗ F ⟩, (5)\r
⟨ /eF ∗ (F/e)⟩, (6)\r
⟨ /e\r
2\r
F ∗ (F/e\r
2\r
)⟩. (7)\r
we can construct theories that include ghost free models for gravity and also\r
Yang-Mills theory and Dirac spinors if the Lorentz algebra is appropriately\r
embedded in larger (super–)algebras. Notice that terms of order higher than\r
two in /e in terms of the form (7) vanish identically due to the nilpotency of the\r
form degree, in close analogy with expansions in Grassmann variables. In this\r
paper, as a simple illustration of the method, we focus on parity-even terms\r
of the form ⟨ X ∗ X ⟩. The same method, however, can be straightforwardly\r
extended to the construction of parity-odd terms.\r
Let us begin by mentioning that products of the Clifford-algebra–valued\r
frame remain closed under the action of the standard Hodge dual operator. For\r
instance, if\r
/e = e\r
a\r
γa (8)\r
denotes the Clifford–valued frame, γ\r
a denotes a Dirac or Majorana gamma ma\u0002trix, and e\r
a\r
is the tetrad one–form, which is a Lorentz–vector–valued differential\r
one-form e\r
a = ea\r
µ dxµ that defines a local orthonormal frame on spacetime, re\u0002lating the spacetime metric to the Minkowski metric via gµν = e\r
a\r
µe\r
b\r
νηab, then\r
the Hodge dual of any homogeneous product\r
/e\r
p ≡ e\r
a1 ∧ · · · ∧ eap γa1···ap\r
(9)\r
3

is again of the same form,\r
∗ /e\r
p =\r
1\r
(d − p)! ϵ\r
a1···ap\r
b1···bd−p\r
e\r
b1 ∧ · · · ∧ ebd−p γa1···ap ∈ Span{/e\r
d−p\r
} , (10)\r
so that the Clifford–exterior algebra generated by the frame is stable under\r
the Hodge dual. Before proceeding further, let us clarify that we have chosen\r
to keep the standard Hodge dual in (5)–(7) so that to avoid introducing extra\r
technicalities that may obscure the main result of the paper. However it is known\r
that the Hodge dual can in fact be written with a Clifford exterior-algebra [20]\r
Now, let us remark that the implementation of a Clifford–algebra valued\r
frame in (5)–(7) allows us to construct more general invariants that using the\r
Lorentz components of the curvature. In order to see this let us consider all\r
possible quadratic combinations of two curvatures, the Hodge dual, the fully\r
skewsymmetric symbol and the metric,\r
ϵabcd F\r
ab Fcd (11)\r
F\r
ab ∗ Fab (12)\r
F\r
ab Fab (13)\r
ϵabcd ∗ F\r
ab Fcd\r
, (14)\r
∗ F\r
ab ∗ Fab (15)\r
ϵabcd ∗ F\r
ab ∗ Fcd\r
. (16)\r
These terms produce only four independent quadratic contractions of Fab cd.\r
Details of the calculation are provided in appendix A.1. However, in constrast\r
to General Relativity, in the Einstein–Cartan formulation of gravity it is not\r
natural to impose symmetry under the pairwise exchange [ab] ↔ [cd] on F[ab][cd].\r
Consequently, the curvature contains both contributions,\r
F[ab][cd] = A[[ab][cd]] + S([ab][cd]) , (17)\r
where A denotes the skewsymmetric part and S the symmetric part. The pair\u0002skewsymmetric sector captures torsional degrees of freedom, while the pair\u0002symmetric sector contains the Riemannian graviton; the Clifford invariants allow\r
these sectors to be probed independently. In other words, the terms (11)–(16)\r
cannot isolate invariants depending purely on the A or the S parts, but using\r
(5)–(7) we can indeed generate quadratic invariants that are linearly indepen\u0002dent of (11)–(16).\r
Notice that contributions to Einstein-Hilbert–Gauss–Bonnet four–form (11)\r
vanishes in (5) and (6), but one finds a nontrivial contribution to it in the /e\r
2\r
–\r
term (7). Therefore a generic linear combination of the terms (5), (6), and (7)\r
provides a natural candidate for an action principle,\r
L = α ⟨F ∗ F⟩ + β ⟨/eF ∗ (F/e)⟩ + γ ⟨/e\r
2\r
F ∗ (F/e\r
2\r
)⟩. (18)\r
However, allowing for a generic linear combination of the terms (5)–(7) gives\r
rise to new contributions (which may or may not be desirable). For instance,\r
4

for arbitrary coefficients one obtains terms such as the Kretschmann invariant\r
and the contraction of two generalized Ricci tensors for F\r
ab, which may lead to\r
the appearance of degrees of freedom with the wrong sign of the kinetic term\r
(ghosts). Nevertheless, a specific choice of coefficients (β = −α, γ = −α/4)\r
ensures that only the Gauss–Bonnet term for F\r
ab survives.\r
In the seminal papers [21, 22], the authors considered a six-parameter La\u0002grangian built from the most general parity even quadratic invariants in gravity\r
with torsion. This requires both, enlarging the Lagrangian by including further\r
terms beyond those appearing in (18), and enlarging the Lorentz algebra to an\r
anti–de Sitter algebra.\r
Another motivation for enlarging the basis of quadratic invariants comes\r
from the geometric inclusion of the full field content in the gauge connection,\r
including matter spinors. This will lead us to extra algebraic constraints to\r
enforce first-order fermion dynamics.\r
In order to incorporate internal gauge bosons and spinors, one may em\u0002bed the Lorentz algebra into the superalgebras osp(n, 4) or su(2, 2|n), which\r
necessarily entails the introduction of spinorial generators associated with su\u0002percharges [23]. For simplicity, we focus on the case of Majorana supercharges,\r
which implies an internal symmetry of so(n) type.\r
We shall work with a block-matrix representation of the form\r
"\r
AdS4×4 Q4×n\r
Qt\r
n×4\r
so(n)n×n\r
#\r
, (19)\r
which makes explicit the Lorentz (or the Anti–de Sitter algebra), fermionic, and\r
internal sectors.\r
Following the ideas developed in [24, 25, 23], and in order to construct a\r
genuinely geometric model, we collect all fields into a single gauge connection\r
valued in the superalgebra osp(n, 4),\r
A =\r

In (20), the fermionic sector involves the composite field /eψ, where spinor\r

In the representation (19), the terms (6) and (7) vanish identically when\r
evaluated on the so(n) internal components of the curvature, 1\r

the full field strength decomposes as\r

Here Lij are the so(n) generators associated with the lower-right block of (19),\r
the components F\r
a\r
correspond to translational generators, while Xα\r
i denote the\r
5

fermionic components of the curvature. The only non-vanishing contribution in\r
the internal gauge sector arises from the term ⟨ F ∗ F ⟩, which yields a standard\r
Yang–Mills kinetic term for the so(n) curvature components F\r
ij . Requiring\r
canonical normalization of the internal gauge bosons fixes the corresponding\r
coefficient to be −1/2.\r
Before continuing with the analysis of the spinor terms, let us clarify that in\r
the definition of the supertraces (6) and (7), the frame is implicitly slashed using\r
the embedding of the γ\r
a matrices in the chosen superalgebra representation.\r
/e = e\r
aΓa , Γa =\r

within the superalgebra context. (23)\r
We now turn to the kinetic terms for the spinors. The fermionic component\r
of the curvature is given by an adS⊗so(n)–covariant derivative of the composite\r
field ξ = /eψ,\r
Xα\r

where T\r
a = Dea ≡ dea + ωa\r
b e\r

is the torsion two-form, and D here denotes\r
the so(1, 3) ⊗ so(n)–covariant derivative acting on ψ. To avoid introducing\r
multiple symbols for covariant derivatives, we shall use D throughout to denote\r
a so(1, 3) ⊗ so(n)–covariant derivative; the appropriate representation of the\r
generators is understood to be chosen according to the object on which D acts.\r
The quadratic terms in the fermionic curvature components, induced by\r
invariants of the type (5), (6), and (7), when evaluated on\r
X = Q\r
i\r
αXαi\r
,\r
generate two types of second derivative terms of the spinor fields through quadratic\r
products of the second term in (27):\r

and (Cγab)αβ∂aψ\r

. (28)\r
The term proportional to γ\r
ab contributes only to a boundary term together\r
with non-minimal couplings. Requiring, however, the cancellation of the Klein–\r
Gordon fermionic term imposes an independent constraint on the coefficients α,\r
β, and γ, leaving only two free parameters in the Lagrangian (see appendix A.5).\r
6

As a consequence, no further freedom remains to adjust relative coefficients so\r
as to eliminate ghosts in the gravitational sector, which requires the satisfaction\r
of three independent linear conditions [22].\r
This makes the inclusion of additional terms in the Lagrangian (18) manda\u0002tory in order to properly complete the ghost-cancellation mechanism in the\r
gravity sector. The terms we shall consider are\r
⟨[/e, F] ∗ ([F, /e])⟩, (29)\r
⟨[/e\r
2\r
, F] ∗ ([F, /e\r
2\r
])⟩. (30)\r
With all the ingredients defined above we therefore define the Lagrangian,\r
which is given by a linear combination of (5), (6), (7), (29) and (30),\r
LLL = α ⟨ F ∗ F ⟩ + β ⟨ /eF ∗ (F/e)⟩ + γ ⟨ /e\r
2\r
F ∗ (F/e\r
2\r
)⟩\r
+ δ⟨[/e, F] ∗ ([F, /e])⟩ + ε⟨[/e\r
2\r
, F] ∗ ([F, /e\r
2\r
])⟩. (31)\r
This model is geometric since all fields are included in the field strength via the\r
gauge connection. The unification achieved here is restrictive since the alge\u0002bra sharply limits admissible dynamics, and it is precisely this restriction that\r
enforces consistency. The ghost–free dynamics further restrict the parameters\r
from five to one, since one condition is required to cancel out fermion second\r
derivative terms and three conditions are required to choose a ghost-free gravity\r
sector, see Table 1 of [22].\r
The restricted set of Clifford–generated invariants in (31) is sufficient to\r
complete a full set of parity even invariants, see Table 1. In order to facilitate\r
comparison with the results of [22], we have followed the authors’ prescription\r
and omitted the R2term by invoking the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for trivial\r
topologies. Nonminimal couplings are also included in the action as a result of\r
the computation of (31) but they are not the focus of the present paper.\r
As an illustration, we consider three representative choices of parameters\r
that reproduce known ghost–free quadratic gravity models. We restrict to the\u0002ories with a propagating graviton and no second–order derivatives in the spinor\r
sector, which together impose four independent conditions. At the linearized\r
level, these requirements truncate part of the propagating spectrum. The result\u0002ing particle content is summarized in Table 2. The analysis underlying Table 2\r
is performed around flat space, and therefore some comments regarding the in\u0002clusion of a cosmological constant term are in order; these are discussed in the\r
text below. The physical interpretation of the A/S splitting, and its relation to\r

Table 1 displays the value of the cosmological constant, Λ = −6α − 36β +\r
144γ, which can in principle take either sign or vanish for suitable choices of\r
parameters. However, within the class of ghost-free models, the cosmological\r
constant is proportional to α, although its sign depends on the specific model,\r
as shown in Table 2. A vanishing cosmological constant can be achieved in\r
three distinct ways. First, one may include a ⟨ /e\r
4\r
⟩ term in the action. Second,\r
additional interaction terms can be introduced, either linear in the curvature\r
or quadratic but parity-odd. The analysis of Table 2 is performed around flat\r
space, and therefore the implications of a non-vanishing cosmological constant\r
deserve separate investigation.\r
3 Discussion and Outlook\r
In this work we have shown that a single geometric action constructed from\r
a Clifford–algebra–valued curvature, together with an induced dual operator\r
built from the frame, reproduces simultaneously the canonical kinetic terms for\r
Yang–Mills fields, spin- 1\r
2\r
fermions, and a class of quadratic gravity models with\r

torsion. Remarkably, for a particular choice of parameters, the gravitational\r
sector contains known ghost-free models with propagating torsion originally\r
identified by Sezgin. This result is structurally enforced, as it emerges without\r
imposing a priori restrictions on the curvature invariants beyond those dictated\r
by the Clifford-algebraic structure.\r
A key conceptual point of the present construction is that gravity is not\r
appended to a Yang–Mills theory, nor is the tetrad introduced as an external\r
compensator field. Instead, both the gravitational and internal gauge sectors\r
arise from the same underlying Clifford–valued curvature invariant. In this\r
sense, the tetrad appears as part of the geometric data defining the dual op\u0002erator, rather than as an independent gauge field. Likewise, the Hodge dual\r
is not assumed as a background operation [26], but is dynamically induced by\r
the Clifford-algebra–valued frame. In contrast to MacDowell–Mansouri–type\r
constructions, where a projection or symmetry breaking is imposed to isolate\r
gravity, here the Lorentz sector and its dynamics are selected algebraically by\r
the Clifford trace itself.\r
Allowing for a generic Einstein–Cartan connection, the curvature naturally\r
decomposes into pair-symmetric and pair-antisymmetric components. This de\u0002composition provides a transparent way to isolate Riemannian and non-Riemannian\r
contributions prior to performing a full spin–parity analysis. Three models were\r
found, in which, at the linearized level, the usual massless 2\r
+ graviton originates\r
from the pair-symmetric sector, while the propagating torsion modes (1\r
± and\r
0\r
− in the ghost-free case) arise from curvature components sourced by contor\u0002tion. Beyond linear order, mixing occurs through quadratic contortion terms,\r
9

but the decomposition remains a useful organizational tool for understanding\r
the spectrum.\r
Another notable feature is that ghost freedom in the quadratic gravity sec\u0002tor is not engineered by an ad hoc tuning of curvature invariants. Rather,\r
the restricted set of quadratic terms generated by traces involving the Clifford\r
frame and the induced dual operator automatically constrains the allowed com\u0002binations. Within this reduced space of invariants, the ghost-free Sezgin model\r
appears as a consistent point in parameter space. This suggests that the absence\r
of pathological degrees of freedom is selected by the algebraic structure of the\r
theory itself, rather than imposed externally.\r
The fermionic sector provides a further nontrivial consistency check. Because\r
the spinor fields enter the connection through the composite object /eψ, naive\r
quadratic curvature terms could potentially generate higher-derivative fermion\r
dynamics. We have shown explicitly that, for the same class of Clifford invari\u0002ants that yield sensible gravitational dynamics, these higher-derivative terms\r
combine so as to reproduce the standard first–order Dirac kinetic term. This\r
cancellation is essential for the consistency of the framework and supports the\r
view that the Clifford–algebraic construction tightly constrains the allowed dy\u0002namics of matter fields.\r
Given the presence of quadratic curvature terms, the resulting theory should\r
be understood as a low–energy effective field theory, valid below the characteris\u0002tic mass scale associated with propagating torsion modes. From this perspective,\r
higher–order invariants involving additional powers of the Clifford–valued frame\r
and curvature are naturally suppressed by the corresponding cutoff scale. The\r
present framework therefore does not attempt to define a UV–complete theory\r
of quantum gravity, but rather provides a controlled and geometrically moti\u0002vated effective description in which gravity, gauge fields, and fermions emerge\r
on the same footing.\r
Several directions merit further investigation. These include the extension to\r
superconformal algebras with chiral fermions, the study of symmetry breaking\r
mechanisms selecting the Lorentz subgroup dynamically, and the exploration\r
of cosmological and phenomenological implications of massive torsion modes.\r
More broadly, the results suggest that Clifford–algebra–based constructions may\r
provide a natural and conceptually economical arena for unifying gravity and\r
gauge interactions without introducing extra dimensions or enlarging the field\r
content beyond that required by geometry itself.\r

A Clifford-algebra contractions and quadratic cur\u0002vature invariants\r
In this section we collect the explicit contractions of Lorentz-algebra–valued\r
curvature two-forms used in the main text and theirrelation to the independent\r
quadratic curvature invariants T1, . . . , T4.\r
A.1 Contractions involving the Hodge dual\r
Let\r
F\r
ab =\r
1\r
2\r
F\r
ab\r
cd e\r
c\r
e\r
d\r
denote the Lorentz curvature two-form, and let ∗ be the spacetime Hodge dual.\r
The following identities hold:\r
ϵabcd F\r
ab Fcd = T1|\r
c1=−\r
1\r
4\r

F\r
ab ∗ Fab = T2|\r
c2=\r

, (37)\r
ϵabcd ∗ F\r
ab ∗ Fcd = T1|\r
c1=−\r
1\r
4\r
. (38)\r
These relations are obtained by expanding the curvature in the vielbein basis\r
and using standard identities for contractions of Levi–Civita symbols with the\r
Hodge dual in four dimensions.\r
A.2 Definition of the quadratic invariants\r
The quadratic invariants appearing above are defined as\r
T1 = c1 ϵabcd ϵ\r
ef gh Fab\r
ef F\r
cd\r
gh v4, (39)\r
T2 = c2 F\r
abcdFabcd v4, (40)\r
T3 = c3 ϵ\r
cdef Fab\r
cd Fabef v4, (41)\r
T4 = c4 ϵ\r
cdef Fcdab Fefab v4, (42)\r

where F\r
ab\r
cd are the scalar-form components of the curvature and\r
v4 = e\r
0\r
e\r
1\r
e\r
2\r
e\r

is the spacetime volume form.\r
The coefficients ci are fixed by matching the contractions in Eqs. (33)–(38)\r
with the invariant basis (39)–(42), as discussed in the main text.\r
A.3 Contractions using Clifford–algebra–valued frame\r
By contrast, products involving traces of the Hodge dual, the Clifford-algebra–\r
valued tetrad, and the curvature are capable of isolating linearly independent\r
combinations of T1, . . . , T4. For instance,\r
⟨ F ∗ F ⟩ = S|c2=−1/4, (43)\r
⟨ /eF ∗ (F/e)⟩ = S|\r
c5 = 1/16\r
c6 = −3/4\r
c7 = 1/4\r
c8 = −1/4\r

⟨ /e\r

2\r
)⟩ = S|\r
c1 = −1/4\r
c2 = −1\r
c5 = −1/4\r
c6 = 3\r
c7 = −1\r
c8 = 1\r

where S =\r

A.4 Tangent-space Gamma matrices\r
The tangent-space gamma matrices satisfy\r
dγa = 0 , Dγa = 0 , (50)\r
where the Lorentz-covariant derivative acts as\r
Dγa ≡ dγa + ω\r
a\r
bγ\r
b + (1/2)Σbcωbcγa − (1/2)γaωbcΣbc . (51)\r

A.5 Quadratic terms of the fermionic curvature\r
Explicitly,\r
⟨Y ∗ Y⟩ = S\r
(fer)\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
d1=6, d2=2\r
, (52)\r
⟨/eY ∗ (Y/e)⟩ = S\r
(fer)\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
d1=12, d2=8\r
, (53)\r
⟨/e\r
2Y ∗ (Y/e2\r
)⟩ = S\r
(fer)\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
d1=−36, d2=−36\r
, (54)\r
where Y = −Q /eDψ and\r
S\r
(fer) = d1 Daψα Cαβ Daψβ\r
v4 + d2 Daψ\r
α\r
(Cγab)αβ Dbψ\r

A generic linear combination of the terms (52)–(54) therefore leads to higher\u0002derivative fermionic kinetic terms and may induce fermionic ghosts.\r
A.6 More contractions using Clifford–algebra–valued frame\r
We may add the following terms, defined using the unsymmetrized trace,\r
⟨[/e, F] ∗ ([F, /e])⟩ =\r
 X\r

i=1\r

In passing, let us note that a convenient definition of the fully symmetrized\r
supertrace of n superalgebra-valued elements X1, . . . , Xn is\r
⟨ X1 · · · Xn⟩FS ≡\r
1\r
n!\r
X\r
π∈Sn\r
(−1)ε(π;X)⟨Xπ(1)Xπ(2) · · · Xπ(n)⟩, (58)\r
where Sn is the permutation group of n elements and (−1)ε(π;X)is the graded\r
sign picked up when permuting the homogeneous elements Xi, namely\r
(−1)ε(π;X) =\r
Y\r
i<j\r
(−1)|Xπ(i)| |Xπ(j)|\r
for each transposition,\r
with |Xi| = 0 for bosonic (even) elements and |Xi| = 1 for fermionic (odd) ones.\r
This fully symmetrized trace greatly simplifies hand computations.\r

B From the A/S pair-exchange split to spin–\r
parity modes\r
B.1 Pair-exchange operator and the A/S decomposition\r
Let F\r
ab be the Lorentz-algebra curvature two-form of a generic (Einstein–\r
Cartan) connection ω\r
ab\r
µ, with components\r
F\r
ab =\r
1\r
2\r
F\r
ab\r
cd e\r
c\r
e\r
d\r
, Fab cd := ηaeηbfF\r
ef\r
cd. (59)\r
The indices [ab] and [cd] label antisymmetric Lorentz pairs. Define the pair\u0002exchange operator P acting on Fab cd by swapping the two index pairs:\r
P[Fab cd] := Fcd ab. (60)\r
Then we define the symmetric and antisymmetric parts under pair exchange,\r
Sab cd :=\r
1\r
2\r
(Fab cd + Fcd ab), Aab cd :=\r
1\r
2\r
(Fab cd − Fcd ab), (61)\r
so that F = S + A and P[S] = S, P[A] = −A.\r
For a torsionless Levi–Civita connection, the Riemann curvature satisfies\r
Rab cd = Rcd ab, hence A = 0 identically. Therefore, A ̸= 0 is a purely non\u0002Riemannian signature: it measures precisely the obstruction to pair symmetry\r
induced by torsion/contortion (or, more generally, by relaxing the usual ex\u0002change symmetry [ab] ↔ [cd]).\r
B.2 Contortion expansion and linearized interpretation\r
Decompose the spin connection into Levi–Civita part plus contortion,\r

R\r
ab ≈ Rab(\r
◦\r
ω) +\r
◦\r
Dκab, κ ∧ κ = O(ϵ\r
2\r
). (65)\r
14

At linear order, Rab cd(\r
◦\r
ω) has the pair-exchange symmetry Rab cd = Rcd ab,\r
hence it contributes only to S. By contrast, the term\r
◦\r
Dκab generically violates\r
pair exchange and is the leading source for A. Thus, schematically,\r
S = R(\r
◦\r
ω) + O(κ\r
2\r
), A =\r
◦\r
Dκ + O(κ\r
2\r
). (66)\r
Equation (66) is the main reason the A/S split is useful: it cleanly separates\r
the torsionless graviton sector from the leading torsional curvature sector, before\r
doing a spin–parity decomposition.\r
B.3 Spin–parity content: why 2+ is in S, and torsion\r
modes arise from A\r
In Poincar´e gauge theory, the propagating modes are classified by decompos\u0002ing torsion and curvature into Lorentz-irreducible pieces and then using spin\r
projection operators. For our purposes, it is enough to recall the standard\r
decomposition of torsion in 4D into\r
Tλµν =\r
1\r
3\r
(vµgλν − vνgλµ) + 1\r
6\r
ελµνρ a\r
ρ + qλµν, (67)\r
where vµ := T\r
λ\r
λµ is the trace vector (parity even), a\r
µ := εµαβγTαβγ is the\r
axial vector (parity odd), and qλµν is the remaining tensor piece (traceless and\r
ε-traceless).\r
At the linearized level, using (63)–(66), the quadratic curvature invariants\r
that contain kinetic terms for torsion necessarily depend on\r
◦\r
Dκ, and hence\r
are supported by the A sector at leading order. The spin–parity identifica\u0002tion proceeds by inserting (67) into the quadratic action and reading off which\r
combinations obtain proper kinetic terms:\r
• The 2\r
+ mode is the usual metric (or tetrad) graviton mode and arises from\r
R(\r
◦\r
ω), hence it belongs to the pair–symmetric sector S at linear order.\r
• The 1\r
+ torsion mode is carried by the parity-even vector vµ and is sourced\r
by derivatives of contortion. Therefore its kinetic terms arise from the\r
◦\r
Dκ\r
part of the curvature, i.e. primarily from A at linear order.\r
• The 1\r
− torsion mode is carried by the parity–odd axial–vector aµ and is\r
also sourced by derivatives of contortion. Therefore its kinetic terms arise\r
from the\r
◦\r
Dκ part of the curvature, i.e. primarily from A at linear order.\r
• The 0\r
− torsion mode is carried by the pseudoscalar/axial sector (equiv\u0002alently, the longitudinal part of aµ) and likewise obtains its kinetic term\r
from\r
◦\r
Dκ, hence again from A at linear order.\r

Abstract\r
A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and struc\u0002ture of gravity, Yang–Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms including\r
ghost freedom in the gravitational sector without tuning. Our results es\u0002tablish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra\r
dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge–gravity\r
constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from\r
a single Clifford–algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking."""

Two long–standing frontiers in theoretical physics aim at unifying the funda\u0002mental interactions: embedding the gauge structure of the Standard Model\r

coherent framework has remained elusive. In this work we show that a single\r

representation of SO(10) elegantly accommodates one SM family plus a right\u0002handed neutrino in a single 16-dimensional representation. Larger exceptional\r
groups further extend this structure, linking to neutrino mass generation and\r
charge quantization, but face persistent phenomenological issues such as pro\u0002ton decay and doublet–triplet splitting. In parallel, algebraic programs have\r
explored whether the SM gauge and matter content could emerge naturally\r
from deeper mathematical structures such as division algebras and Clifford\r
modules. In particular, the octonions O, whose automorphism group is G2,\r
connect to exceptional Lie algebras through the Freudenthal–Tits magic square\r
and encode one SM generation’s quantum numbers within minimal ideals of\r
C⊗H⊗O [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These algebraic schemes are mathematically rigid and\r
aesthetically appealing, yet a fully predictive model encompassing dynamics,\r
symmetry breaking, and fermion masses remains unrealized.\r
In parallel, gauge-theoretic formulations of gravity recast Einstein’s theory\r
in first-order form using the tetrad e\r
a\r
µ and spin connection ω\r
ab\r
µ [8]. Early\r
works by Utiyama, Sciama, Kibble, Hayashi and Nakano, and later Hehl, es\u0002tablished that while local Lorentz symmetry can be treated as a gauge group,\r
the resulting actions differ from Yang–Mills theories because the tetrad does\r
not transform as a connection [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Attempts to extend\r
the gauge principle to the full Poincar´e or (A)dS groups face degeneracies\r
in the algebra’s Cartan–Killing metric that render translational components\r
non-dynamical [15, 16]. Weyl’s early generalization of the Dirac equation to\r
curved spacetime showed that spinors intrinsically require a Lorentz gauge struc\u0002ture [17]. Later, the MacDowell–Mansouri construction framed gravity as a\r
symmetry-breaking gauge theory with an algebraic dual operator selecting the\r
Lorentz-invariant sector [18, 19].\r
The repeated emergence of Clifford algebras across grand unification, alge\u0002braic models, and gauge formulations of gravity suggests a common geometric\r
foundation. Building on this observation, previous work proposed that imple\u0002menting supersymmetry in the adjoint representation yields unified actions of\r
the form\r
S =\r
Z\r
⟨ F ⊛ F ⟩, (1)\r
where F is the field strength and ⊛ a generalized dual operator . However, that\r
construction defined ⊛ only for two-forms in four dimensions, limiting its scope.\r
Notably, skewsymmetric products of Clifford-algebra–valued frames naturally\r
reproduce the same invariant structures via the Hodge dual.\r
Here we show that a single action built from a Clifford-algebra–valued cur\u0002vature and an induced dual operator simultaneously reproduces the canonical\r
kinetic terms of gravity, Yang–Mills fields, and spin- 1\r
2\r
fermions. Remarkably,\r
within the restricted space of quadratic invariants generated by this construc\u0002tion, a known ghost-free quadratic gravity theory with propagating torsion,\r
originally identified by Sezgin, emerges without fine tuning. The cancellation\r
of higher-derivative fermionic terms follows from the same algebraic structure,\r
indicating that the framework is not a reformulation of gauge gravity but a\r
genuinely constrained geometric unification.\r

we can construct theories that include ghost free models for gravity and also\r

two in /e in terms of the form (7) vanish identically due to the nilpotency of the\r

paper, as a simple illustration of the method, we focus on parity-even terms\r

extended to the construction of parity-odd terms.\r

to keep the standard Hodge dual in (5)–(7) so that to avoid introducing extra\r
technicalities that may obscure the main result of the paper. However it is known\r
that the Hodge dual can in fact be written with a Clifford exterior-algebra [20]\r
Now, let us remark that the implementation of a Clifford–algebra valued\r
frame in (5)–(7) allows us to construct more general invariants that using the\r
Lorentz components of the curvature. In order to see this let us consider all\r
possible quadratic combinations of two curvatures, the Hodge dual, the fully\r
skewsymmetric symbol and the metric,\r
ϵabcd F\r
ab Fcd (11)\r
F\r
ab ∗ Fab (12)\r
F\r
ab Fab (13)\r
ϵabcd ∗ F\r
ab Fcd\r
, (14)\r
∗ F\r
ab ∗ Fab (15)\r
ϵabcd ∗ F\r
ab ∗ Fcd\r
. (16)\r
These terms produce only four independent quadratic contractions of Fab cd.\r
Details of the calculation are provided in appendix A.1. However, in constrast\r
to General Relativity, in the Einstein–Cartan formulation of gravity it is not\r
natural to impose symmetry under the pairwise exchange [ab] ↔ [cd] on F[ab][cd].\r
Consequently, the curvature contains both contributions,\r
F[ab][cd] = A[[ab][cd]] + S([ab][cd]) , (17)\r
where A denotes the skewsymmetric part and S the symmetric part. The pair\u0002skewsymmetric sector captures torsional degrees of freedom, while the pair\u0002symmetric sector contains the Riemannian graviton; the Clifford invariants allow\r
these sectors to be probed independently. In other words, the terms (11)–(16)\r
cannot isolate invariants depending purely on the A or the S parts, but using\r
(5)–(7) we can indeed generate quadratic invariants that are linearly indepen\u0002dent of (11)–(16).\r
Notice that contributions to Einstein-Hilbert–Gauss–Bonnet four–form (11)\r
vanishes in (5) and (6), but one finds a nontrivial contribution to it in the /e\r
2\r
–\r
term (7). Therefore a generic linear combination of the terms (5), (6), and (7)\r
provides a natural candidate for an action principle,\r

However, allowing for a generic linear combination of the terms (5)–(7) gives\r
rise to new contributions (which may or may not be desirable). For instance,\r
4

for arbitrary coefficients one obtains terms such as the Kretschmann invariant\r
and the contraction of two generalized Ricci tensors for F\r
ab, which may lead to\r
the appearance of degrees of freedom with the wrong sign of the kinetic term\r
(ghosts). Nevertheless, a specific choice of coefficients (β = −α, γ = −α/4)\r
ensures that only the Gauss–Bonnet term for F\r
ab survives.\r
In the seminal papers [21, 22], the authors considered a six-parameter La\u0002grangian built from the most general parity even quadratic invariants in gravity\r
with torsion. This requires both, enlarging the Lagrangian by including further\r
terms beyond those appearing in (18), and enlarging the Lorentz algebra to an\r
anti–de Sitter algebra.\r
Another motivation for enlarging the basis of quadratic invariants comes\r
from the geometric inclusion of the full field content in the gauge connection,\r
including matter spinors. This will lead us to extra algebraic constraints to\r
enforce first-order fermion dynamics.\r
In order to incorporate internal gauge bosons and spinors, one may em\u0002bed the Lorentz algebra into the superalgebras osp(n, 4) or su(2, 2|n), which\r
necessarily entails the introduction of spinorial generators associated with su\u0002percharges [23]. For simplicity, we focus on the case of Majorana supercharges,\r
which implies an internal symmetry of so(n) type.\r
We shall work with a block-matrix representation of the form\r
"\r

so(n)n×n\r
#\r
, (19)\r
which makes explicit the Lorentz (or the Anti–de Sitter algebra), fermionic, and\r
internal sectors.\r
Following the ideas developed in [24, 25, 23], and in order to construct a\r
genuinely geometric model, we collect all fields into a single gauge connection\r
valued in the superalgebra osp(n, 4),\r

the components F\r

fermionic components of the curvature. The only non-vanishing contribution in\r
the internal gauge sector arises from the term ⟨ F ∗ F ⟩, which yields a standard\r
Yang–Mills kinetic term for the so(n) curvature components F\r
ij . Requiring\r
canonical normalization of the internal gauge bosons fixes the corresponding\r
coefficient to be −1/2.\r
Before continuing with the analysis of the spinor terms, let us clarify that in\r
the definition of the supertraces (6) and (7), the frame is implicitly slashed using\r
the embedding of the γ\r
a matrices in the chosen superalgebra representation.\r

We now turn to the kinetic terms for the spinors. The fermionic component\r
of the curvature is given by an adS⊗so(n)–covariant derivative of the composite\r

where T\r
a = Dea ≡ dea + ωa\r
b e\r

is the torsion two-form, and D here denotes\r
the so(1, 3) ⊗ so(n)–covariant derivative acting on ψ. To avoid introducing\r
multiple symbols for covariant derivatives, we shall use D throughout to denote\r
a so(1, 3) ⊗ so(n)–covariant derivative; the appropriate representation of the\r
generators is understood to be chosen according to the object on which D acts.\r
The quadratic terms in the fermionic curvature components, induced by\r
invariants of the type (5), (6), and (7), when evaluated on\r

This model is geometric since all fields are included in the field strength via the\r
gauge connection. The unification achieved here is restrictive since the alge\u0002bra sharply limits admissible dynamics, and it is precisely this restriction that\r
enforces consistency. The ghost–free dynamics further restrict the parameters\r
from five to one, since one condition is required to cancel out fermion second\r
derivative terms and three conditions are required to choose a ghost-free gravity\r
sector, see Table 1 of [22].\r
The restricted set of Clifford–generated invariants in (31) is sufficient to\r
complete a full set of parity even invariants, see Table 1. In order to facilitate\r
comparison with the results of [22], we have followed the authors’ prescription\r
and omitted the R2term by invoking the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for trivial\r
topologies. Nonminimal couplings are also included in the action as a result of\r
the computation of (31) but they are not the focus of the present paper.\r
As an illustration, we consider three representative choices of parameters\r
that reproduce known ghost–free quadratic gravity models. We restrict to the\u0002ories with a propagating graviton and no second–order derivatives in the spinor\r
sector, which together impose four independent conditions. At the linearized\r
level, these requirements truncate part of the propagating spectrum. The result\u0002ing particle content is summarized in Table 2. The analysis underlying Table 2\r

torsion. Remarkably, for a particular choice of parameters, the gravitational\r
sector contains known ghost-free models with propagating torsion originally\r
identified by Sezgin. This result is structurally enforced, as it emerges without\r
imposing a priori restrictions on the curvature invariants beyond those dictated\r
by the Clifford-algebraic structure.\r
A key conceptual point of the present construction is that gravity is not\r
appended to a Yang–Mills theory, nor is the tetrad introduced as an external\r
compensator field. Instead, both the gravitational and internal gauge sectors\r
arise from the same underlying Clifford–valued curvature invariant. In this\r
sense, the tetrad appears as part of the geometric data defining the dual op\u0002erator, rather than as an independent gauge field. Likewise, the Hodge dual\r
is not assumed as a background operation [26], but is dynamically induced by\r
the Clifford-algebra–valued frame. In contrast to MacDowell–Mansouri–type\r
constructions, where a projection or symmetry breaking is imposed to isolate\r
gravity, here the Lorentz sector and its dynamics are selected algebraically by\r
the Clifford trace itself.\r
Allowing for a generic Einstein–Cartan connection, the curvature naturally\r
decomposes into pair-symmetric and pair-antisymmetric components. This de\u0002composition provides a transparent way to isolate Riemannian and non-Riemannian\r
contributions prior to performing a full spin–parity analysis. Three models were\r
found, in which, at the linearized level, the usual massless 2\r
+ graviton originates\r
from the pair-symmetric sector, while the propagating torsion modes (1\r
± and\r
0\r
− in the ghost-free case) arise from curvature components sourced by contor\u0002tion. Beyond linear order, mixing occurs through quadratic contortion terms,\r
9

but the decomposition remains a useful organizational tool for understanding\r
the spectrum.\r
Another notable feature is that ghost freedom in the quadratic gravity sec\u0002tor is not engineered by an ad hoc tuning of curvature invariants. Rather,\r
the restricted set of quadratic terms generated by traces involving the Clifford\r
frame and the induced dual operator automatically constrains the allowed com\u0002binations. Within this reduced space of invariants, the ghost-free Sezgin model\r
appears as a consistent point in parameter space. This suggests that the absence\r
of pathological degrees of freedom is selected by the algebraic structure of the\r
theory itself, rather than imposed externally.\r
The fermionic sector provides a further nontrivial consistency check. Because\r
the spinor fields enter the connection through the composite object /eψ, naive\r
quadratic curvature terms could potentially generate higher-derivative fermion\r
dynamics. We have shown explicitly that, for the same class of Clifford invari\u0002ants that yield sensible gravitational dynamics, these higher-derivative terms\r
combine so as to reproduce the standard first–order Dirac kinetic term. This\r
cancellation is essential for the consistency of the framework and supports the\r
view that the Clifford–algebraic construction tightly constrains the allowed dy\u0002namics of matter fields.\r
Given the presence of quadratic curvature terms, the resulting theory should\r
be understood as a low–energy effective field theory, valid below the characteris\u0002tic mass scale associated with propagating torsion modes. From this perspective,\r
higher–order invariants involving additional powers of the Clifford–valued frame\r
and curvature are naturally suppressed by the corresponding cutoff scale. The\r
present framework therefore does not attempt to define a UV–complete theory\r
of quantum gravity, but rather provides a controlled and geometrically moti\u0002vated effective description in which gravity, gauge fields, and fermions emerge\r
on the same footing.\r
Several directions merit further investigation. These include the extension to\r
superconformal algebras with chiral fermions, the study of symmetry breaking\r
mechanisms selecting the Lorentz subgroup dynamically, and the exploration\r
of cosmological and phenomenological implications of massive torsion modes.\r
More broadly, the results suggest that Clifford–algebra–based constructions may\r
provide a natural and conceptually economical arena for unifying gravity and\r
gauge interactions without introducing extra dimensions or enlarging the field\r
content beyond that required by geometry itself.\r

Cartan) connection ω\r

The indices [ab] and [cd] label antisymmetric Lorentz pairs. Define the pair\u0002exchange operator P acting on Fab cd by swapping the two index pairs:\r
P[Fab cd] := Fcd ab. (60)\r
Then we define the symmetric and antisymmetric parts under pair exchange,\r
Sab cd :=\r
1\r
2\r
(Fab cd + Fcd ab), Aab cd :=\r
1\r
2\r
(Fab cd − Fcd ab), (61)\r
so that F = S + A and P[S] = S, P[A] = −A.\r
For a torsionless Levi–Civita connection, the Riemann curvature satisfies\r
Rab cd = Rcd ab, hence A = 0 identically. Therefore, A ̸= 0 is a purely non\u0002Riemannian signature: it measures precisely the obstruction to pair symmetry\r
induced by torsion/contortion (or, more generally, by relaxing the usual ex\u0002change symmetry [ab] ↔ [cd]).\r

ω) has the pair-exchange symmetry Rab cd = Rcd ab,\r
hence it contributes only to S. By contrast, the term\r
◦\r
Dκab generically violates\r
pair exchange and is the leading source for A. Thus, schematically,\r
S = R(\r

Equation (66) is the main reason the A/S split is useful: it cleanly separates\r
the torsionless graviton sector from the leading torsional curvature sector, before\r
doing a spin–parity decomposition.\r
B.3 Spin–parity content: why 2+ is in S, and torsion\r
modes arise from A\r
In Poincar´e gauge theory, the propagating modes are classified by decompos\u0002ing torsion and curvature into Lorentz-irreducible pieces and then using spin\r
projection operators. For our purposes, it is enough to recall the standard\r
decomposition of torsion in 4D into\r
Tλµν =\r
1\r
3\r
(vµgλν − vνgλµ) + 1\r
6\r
ελµνρ a\r
ρ + qλµν, (67)\r
where vµ := T\r
λ\r
λµ is the trace vector (parity even), a\r
µ := εµαβγTαβγ is the\r
axial vector (parity odd), and qλµν is the remaining tensor piece (traceless and\r
ε-traceless).\r
At the linearized level, using (63)–(66), the quadratic curvature invariants\r
that contain kinetic terms for torsion necessarily depend on\r
◦\r
Dκ, and hence\r
are supported by the A sector at leading order. The spin–parity identifica\u0002tion proceeds by inserting (67) into the quadratic action and reading off which\r
combinations obtain proper kinetic terms:\r
• The 2\r
+ mode is the usual metric (or tetrad) graviton mode and arises from\r
R(\r
◦\r
ω), hence it belongs to the pair–symmetric sector S at linear order.\r
• The 1\r
+ torsion mode is carried by the parity-even vector vµ and is sourced\r
by derivatives of contortion. Therefore its kinetic terms arise from the\r
◦\r
Dκ\r
part of the curvature, i.e. primarily from A at linear order.\r
• The 1\r
− torsion mode is carried by the parity–odd axial–vector aµ and is\r
also sourced by derivatives of contortion. Therefore its kinetic terms arise\r
from the\r
◦\r
Dκ part of the curvature, i.e. primarily from A at linear order.\r
• The 0\r
− torsion mode is carried by the pseudoscalar/axial sector (equiv\u0002alently, the longitudinal part of aµ) and likewise obtains its kinetic term\r
from\r
◦\r
Dκ, hence again from A at linear order."""
