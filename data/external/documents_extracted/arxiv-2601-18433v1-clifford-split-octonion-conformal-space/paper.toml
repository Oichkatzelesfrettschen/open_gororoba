Preface\r
At the dawn of our Universe, during the inflationary epoch, spacetime underwent a\r
brief but dramatic burst of quasi-exponential expansion. In this extreme regime, all\r
quantum fields were effectively massless, and their dynamics were dictated by the\r
intertwined structures of de Sitter (dS) and conformal symmetries. These symmetries\r
constrained the primordial quantum fluctuations, which ultimately seeded the large\u0002scale structure of the cosmos we observe today. Understanding the mathematical\r
fabric of these massless (conformal) fields is therefore central not only to fundamental\r
physics but also to modern cosmology, shedding light on the quantum origin of\r
cosmic structures and the near-scale invariance of primordial perturbations.\r
“...as time goes on, it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician\r
finds interesting are the same as those which Nature has chosen.”\r
— Paul Dirac (1939)\r
This profound insight from Paul Dirac perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this\r
volume, which explores the elegant mathematical structures underlying massless\r
elementary systems — “free” fields or particles — in dS spacetime. dS spacetime, the\r
maximally symmetric solution of Einstein’s equations with a positive cosmological\r
constant Λ, is a manifold of constant positive curvature that models an exponentially\r
expanding Universe and closely approximates the large-scale geometry of our present\r
cosmos.\r
This volume is part of a broader research program dedicated to developing a\r
mathematically rigorous, representation-theoretic framework for elementary systems\r
in dS spacetime. In line with Wigner’s fundamental principle — that quantum\r
elementary systems correspond to unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of\r
the underlying spacetime symmetry group — quantum elementary systems in dS\r
spacetime are identified with (projective) UIRs of the dS relativity group SO0 (4, 1)\r
or its universal covering group Sp(2, 2) \u001B Spin(4, 1). Wigner originally formulated\r
this classification within the flat Minkowski setting, where rest mass 𝑚 and spin 𝑠\r
of a system serve as the fundamental invariants labeling the corresponding UIR of\r
the Poincaré group ISL(2, C) — the relativity group of flat Minkowski spacetime.\r
Introducing a constant curvature into spacetime is the sole mechanism by which\r
vii

viii Preface\r
Poincaré symmetry is deformed, giving rise to the dS and anti-dS symmetry groups;\r
in this curved context, the notion of mass is replaced by a curvature-dependent\r
energy parameter, while spin remains a discrete invariant.\r
Within this robust representation-theoretic framework, and building on concepts\r
developed in the earlier volume, The de Sitter (dS) group and its representations\r
(2nd ed., Springer, Cham, Switzerland, 2024), this work delves more deeply into\r
the mathematical structures underlying dS massless elementary systems. Fully self\u0002contained, it places particular emphasis on the interplay between massless conformal\r
representations and their restrictions to dS spacetime, with Clifford algebras serving\r
as a unifying algebraic framework throughout.\r
Beyond Wigner’s foundational framework, it has long been recognized that the\r
massless nature of elementary systems is intimately tied to deeper symmetry prin\u0002ciples — most notably, conformal symmetry. At the heart of this symmetry lies\r
the conformal group U(2, 2) — the U(1)-extended form of SU(2, 2) \u001B SO(4, 2)\r
— whose unitary representations encompass a rich variety of elementary systems.\r
Among these, the massless representations, commonly called ladder representa\u0002tions, form a distinguished subclass, ideally suited for describing physically relevant\r
massless systems. First studied by Mack and Todorov in the late 1960s, these rep\u0002resentations exhibit the striking property of remaining irreducible when restricted\r
to the quantum-mechanical Poincaré subgroup ISL(2, C). In this limit, they yield\r
the well-known Poincaré massless representations, characterized by vanishing rest\r
mass and quantized helicity. These representations form the natural framework for\r
describing lightlike — or massless — elementary systems in Minkowski spacetime\r
and serve as a conceptual springboard for investigating their counterparts in more\r
general geometric settings.\r
This volume undertakes a detailed study of the restriction of massless (ladder)\r
conformal representations to dS spacetime. Specifically, it considers the embedding\r
of SO0 (4, 1) into the conformal group U(2, 2) via its universal covering Sp(2, 2).\r
Within this framework, we analyze the restriction of conformal ladder representa\u0002tions to dS symmetry, emphasizing the persistence of their irreducibility and its\r
implications for the structure of massless fields in curved geometries.\r
A defining feature of this work, which sets it apart from earlier studies, is the\r
use of Clifford algebras — specifically 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) — as the primary framework, rather\r
than U(2, 2) directly. Through a Clifford-split-octonion construction, 8-component\r
Majorana spinors are realized explicitly in a geometrically enriched form. Conceptu\u0002ally, this embeds spinorial degrees of freedom within an 8-dimensional composition\r
algebra governed by alternativity (via the Moufang identities). Left-multiplication\r
by split-octonion units yields coherent operators realizing the Majorana gamma ma\u0002trices, fusing algebraic, spinorial, and geometric structures, and exposing a deep link\r
between spinor geometry and the underlying composition-algebraic structure.\r
Within this framework, the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) emerges\r
naturally from the commutators of bivectors in the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 1), while the Clifford pseudoscalar generates the central 𝔲(1), producing the\r
full conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1). This construction provides\r
direct access to the full conformal group U(2, 2) entirely within the Clifford alge-

Preface ix\r
bra, with exponentials of the Lie algebra elements — which generate the group —\r
admitting finite-series representations intrinsic to the Clifford framework. Likewise,\r
the formalism accommodates the dS Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) and its universal covering\r
group Sp(2, 2), so that all fundamental Lie group-theoretic operations — expo\u0002nentiation, inversion, multiplication, and spinorial action — are performed entirely\r
within the Clifford framework, making computations both explicit and conceptually\r
transparent. Moreover, the split-octonion realization unifies spinorial and tensorial\r
representations, allowing the explicit construction of ladder operators, Casimir in\u0002variants, and invariant bilinear forms for massless fields of arbitrary helicity.\r
In short, by situating the spinors within the rich architecture of split-octonions,\r
the framework uncovers deep and previously hidden correspondences between\r
dS/conformal symmetries and alternative and exceptional algebraic structures, sug\u0002gesting a conceptual unity underlying the organization of massless fields in curved\r
spacetime.\r
The methods developed here are designed to be both rigorous and accessi\u0002ble. Graduate students are guided step by step through the algebraic, geometric,\r
and representation-theoretic tools, while advanced researchers are provided with\r
concrete techniques and fresh perspectives for explicit computations and theoreti\u0002cal explorations. By integrating spinorial, tensorial, and group-theoretic structures\r
within a single algebraic setting, the monograph bridges multiple domains — from\r
higher-spin physics, conformal geometry, and quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\r
spacetimes, to string theory, holography, and cosmological modeling.\r
In this way, the work serves simultaneously as a pedagogical guide, a techni\u0002cal reference, and a conceptual resource. It clarifies how symmetry, curvature, and\r
algebraic structure converge in the theory of massless fields, and it highlights the\r
conceptual role of the split-octonion realization as a unifying structure that connects\r
spinorial geometry, algebraic formalism, and the representation theory of mass\u0002less conformal systems, pointing toward new directions for both mathematical and\r
physical research.\r

An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary\r
Systems and Wigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS)\r
Geometry\r
Abstract This chapter sets the stage for the monograph by outlining its central\r
motivations, thematic scope, and methodological framework. It places the study of\r
conformal massless elementary systems — “free” fields or particles — within both a\r
historical and conceptual context, tracing the influence of Ivan Todorov’s pioneering\r
work and the enduring significance of Wigner’s principles for the classification of\r
elementary systems. By emphasizing the interplay between representation theory,\r
conformal invariance, and the geometry of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, the chapter\r
provides a conceptual roadmap for analyzing massless elementary systems in cos\u0002mologically significant settings. It also establishes key conventions and notational\r
standards, ensuring consistency throughout the text. Serving as both an introduc\u0002tion and a conceptual guide, this chapter prepares readers for the deeper algebraic,\r
geometric, and physical developments in the subsequent chapters.\r
1.1 Conformal Symmetry in Historical Perspective and the\r
Legacy of Ivan Todorov\r
Conformal symmetry — the invariance of physical systems under transformations\r
that preserve angles while not necessarily preserving distances — has occupied a\r
foundational role in the development of theoretical physics. Its conceptual origins\r
trace back to the early twentieth century, when mathematicians and physicists be\u0002gan the systematic study of transformations preserving local geometric structures,\r
thereby establishing the algebraic and geometric groundwork for modern symmetry\r
principles in both quantum field theory (QFT) and relativity. The recognition that\r
geometry can enforce structural constraints on physical laws elevated symmetry to\r
the status of a unifying paradigm across diverse domains of physics.\r
In the 1930s, Cartan’s pioneering work [1] on differential geometry provided a\r
rigorous framework for analyzing symmetries on curved manifolds, introducing con\u0002cepts such as torsion, curvature, and moving frames. While Cartan did not explicitly\r
formulate conformal symmetry in physics, his formalism later supplied essential ge\u00021

21 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
ometric and algebraic machinery for its systematic study. Concurrently, Weyl’s 1918\r
proposal [2] of scale invariance, further developed during the 1920s and 1930s, high\u0002lighted the profound interplay between geometry and physical law, foreshadowing\r
the systematic consideration of local angle-preserving and scale transformations in\r
theoretical physics.\r
By the 1950s and early 1960s, the mathematical study of unitary representations\r
of Lie groups, particularly the Poincaré group, had been advanced through the foun\u0002dational work of Wigner, who classified elementary particles as unitary irreducible\r
representations (UIRs) of spacetime symmetries [3], and by Newton and Wigner’s\r
analysis of relativistic localization [4]. Further progress was made by V. Bargmann in\r
his classification of Lorentz group representations [5], and by Gel’fand and Naimark\r
in their systematic treatment of representations of classical groups [6]. Building on\r
these foundations, mathematicians such as Segal [7] and Mackey [8] developed the\r
theory of induced representations and harmonic analysis on groups, while Harish\u0002Chandra [9] established the general representation theory of semisimple Lie groups.\r
These developments clarified the classification of massive and Poincaré massless\r
representations — including helicity states and the more exotic continuous-spin\r
cases — and provided representation-theoretic tools that were later extended to\r
larger symmetry groups, notably the conformal group, as in the rigorous treatment\r
by Gel’fand, Minlos, and Shapiro [10] and later in the field-theoretic constructions\r
of Mack and Salam [11].\r
Building on algebraic and representation-theoretic foundations, Fronsdal’s sem\u0002inal 1978 work [12] provided a systematic formulation of free massless higher\u0002spin fields in a Poincaré-invariant framework. His construction introduced the now\u0002standard gauge-invariant Fronsdal equations, giving consistent field equations for\r
totally symmetric particles of arbitrary spin. Although originally formulated in flat\r
spacetime, this framework laid the foundation for later developments that extended\r
higher-spin fields to (anti-)dS backgrounds and to conformal higher-spin theories.\r
These advances were part of a broader trend in the 1970s and 1980s in which con\u0002formal symmetry emerged as a unifying principle across diverse areas of theoretical\r
physics, including conformal field theory (CFT), string theory, the study of critical\r
phenomena in statistical mechanics, and higher-spin gauge theories.\r
As this conceptual and algebraic framework took shape, the late 1960s marked a\r
pivotal phase in the study of conformal symmetry, featuring one of the first systematic\r
investigations of massless representations and the introduction of ladder represen\u0002tations of the conformal group [13]. Spearheaded by the landmark collaboration\r
between Gerhard Mack and Ivan Todorov, this program demonstrated how Poincaré\r
massless representations could be consistently extended to the conformal group.\r
The resulting algebraic framework provided a mathematically rigorous characteriza\u0002tion of massless elementary systems and established a bridge between conventional\r
flat-space QFT and its conformally extended formulations. This formalism subse\u0002quently became foundational for the precise treatment of massless quantum fields in\r
both Minkowski and curved spacetimes, underpinning later developments in CFT,\r
higher-spin theories, and the study of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics.

1.1 Conformal Symmetry in Historical Perspective and the Legacy of Ivan Todorov 3\r
It was within this evolving historical landscape that Ivan Todorov (1933-2025)\r
emerged as a leading figure whose contributions bridged the realms of rigorous\r
mathematics and theoretical physics. Born in Sofia, Todorov earned his MSc in\r
Physics from Sofia University in 1956. He then pursued his PhD at the Joint Institute\r
for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, completing his thesis in 1960 under the\r
supervision of the renowned theoretical physicist Nikolai N. Bogoliubov [14, 15].\r
His early research at JINR and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton laid\r
the foundation for his seminal contributions. Todorov advanced the axiomatic and\r
algebraic foundations of QFT and developed a mathematically precise understanding\r
of CFTs, making the ladder representation program and its applications in conformal\r
symmetry a central part of his lasting legacy.\r
Fig. 1.1 Professor Ivan Todorov (1933-2025), whose pioneering contributions to CFT, ladder\r
representations, and massless quantum systems profoundly shaped mathematical physics.\r
Beyond his seminal collaboration with Nikolaj N. Bogoliubov and Gerhard Mack,\r
Todorov worked with distinguished scientists such as Valentine Bargmann, Louis\r
Michel, Claude Itzykson, and Victor Kac, thereby enriching the theoretical under\u0002standing of symmetries and advancing the dialogue between algebraic structures\r
and physical intuition [16]. Throughout his career, he consistently emphasized the\r
foundational role of group-theoretical methods, forging deep connections between\r
Lie algebra representations, conformal transformations, and the structural analysis\r
of QFT. His extensive body of work includes influential monographs, most notably\r
General principles of quantum field theory [17], Introduction to axiomatic quantum\r
field theory [18], and Harmonic analysis: on the 𝑛-dimensional Lorentz group and\r
its application to conformal quantum field theory [19], co-authored with N.N. Bo\u0002goliubov and collaborators, which remain indispensable references for researchers.\r
Equally significant were Todorov’s integrity, his dedication to mentorship, and his\r
sustained efforts to foster international collaboration. He played a leading role in\r
organizing conferences and advanced schools that brought together Eastern and\r
Western physicists during politically challenging times, thereby strengthening the\r
global community of mathematical physics [20].

41 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
This monograph is dedicated to the memory of Professor Ivan Todorov, whose\r
profound contributions and guidance were instrumental in shaping this work. Draw\u0002ing extensively on his insights, notes, and foundational studies, it reflects his enduring\r
impact on the field. Todorov’s legacy continues to inspire generations of physicists\r
and mathematicians, exemplifying the integration of rigorous mathematics with deep\r
physical understanding that he championed throughout his career.\r
1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under\r
Curvature-Induced Deformations\r
In modern theories of elementary systems — whether field-theoretic or phenomeno\u0002logical — their formulation, and in particular their interpretation, fundamentally rely\r
on the concepts of energy, momentum, mass, and spin, which emerge from invari\u0002ance under the Poincaré group, the relativity group of flat Minkowski spacetime. It\r
is, however, widely acknowledged that such theories cannot ultimately rest solely\r
on this symmetry. A fully consistent framework must respect the broader principle\r
of general covariance, reflecting Einstein’s vision of spacetime as a Riemannian\r
manifold.\r
Beyond the familiar flat Minkowski setting, the absence of nontrivial motion\r
groups in generic curved backgrounds makes the direct extension of these funda\u0002mental notions highly nontrivial, if not impossible. In this context, the common\r
suggestion to merely generalize fundamental equations — such as the Klein-Gordon\r
or Dirac equations — to fully covariant forms misses the deeper issue; it addresses\r
only the formal structure, not the conceptual foundation. Indeed, modern theories of\r
elementary systems are not primarily concerned with differential equations per se,\r
but with the deeper symmetry principles that underlie them.\r
This is precisely where Wigner’s principle — particularly, its remarkable continu\u0002ity under curvature-induced deformations — proves essential, providing a robust and\r
conceptually coherent framework for extending the classification and understanding\r
of elementary systems from flat Minkowski spacetime to curved dS and anti-dS\r
spacetimes.\r
1.2.1 Wigner’s Elementary Systems\r
In the field-theoretic formulation of elementary systems, the foundational works of\r
Eugene Wigner [3, 4] established that the principles of special relativity impose\r
symmetry requirements on the laws of nature — most notably, invariance under the\r
Poincaré group in flat Minkowski spacetime.\r
Within the flat Minkowski framework, quantum elementary systems are identi\u0002fied with (projective) UIRs of the Poincaré group (or one of its coverings) [3, 4].\r
Each such representation is uniquely characterized by two invariant quantities: the

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations5\r
rest mass 𝑚 and the spin 𝑠 of the system. These invariants not only encode the\r
system’s fundamental physical properties but also reflect the symmetry structure of\r
the underlying Minkowski spacetime.\r
Remarkably, introducing a constant curvature into spacetime yields the unique\r
natural and continuous deformation of Poincaré symmetry group. This deformation\r
gives rise to the dS and anti-dS groups of motion. The corresponding dS and anti\u0002dS spacetimes [21, 22] — maximally symmetric solutions of Einstein’s equations\r
with, respectively, positive and negative cosmological constant Λ — thereby acquire\r
a privileged status as the only curved backgrounds in which Wigner’s symmetry\u0002based definition of elementary systems admits a meaningful generalization. In these\r
settings, elementary systems are once again described by UIRs of the relevant space\u0002time symmetry groups. As in the flat case, these representations are classified by two\r
invariants — the spin and a characteristic mass or energy scale — thus preserving\r
the core structural features of Wigner’s original framework.\r

Sitter (anti-dS) groups as subgroups of the conformal group. Both dS and anti-dS groups contract\r
to the Poincaré group in the flat (zero-curvature) limit Λ → 0. Conversely, for nonzero curvature,\r
the dS and AdS groups can be regarded as deformations of the Poincaré group. The conformal\r
group provides a unifying framework encompassing all three.

1.2.2 Wigner’s Massless Elementary Systems\r
Beyond Wigner’s foundational framework, it has long been established that the\r
massless nature of elementary systems is intimately connected to deeper symmetry\r
principles — most notably, conformal symmetry [12, 13, 23, 24, 25]. This symmetry\r
is not merely auxiliary structures but constitutes intrinsic aspects of massless field\r
dynamics, manifesting both at the level of representation theory and in the behavior\r
of field equations under spacetime transformations.\r
In the flat Minkowski setting, massless elementary systems correspond to UIRs of\r
the Poincaré group with vanishing mass and discrete helicity — commonly referred\r
to as Poincaré massless representations. A result of fundamental significance, due to\r
Mack and Todorov [13, 25], establishes that each such representation admits a unique\r
extension to a UIR of the conformal group SU(2, 2) \u001B SO(4, 2), or more generally\r
its U(1)-extended form U(2, 2); these conformal UIRs are commonly called ladder\r
representations. This framework furnishes a canonical and rigorous link between\r
masslessness and conformal symmetry, so that any quantum system realizing a\r
Poincaré massless representation necessarily carries a well-defined conformal action.\r
A parallel and equally deep structure is present in constant-curvature spacetimes.\r
In dS and anti-dS geometries, the natural analogues of Poincaré massless represen\u0002tations are those UIRs of the respective symmetry groups whose unique conformal\r
extensions are massless (ladder) representations. In representation-theoretic terms,\r
these conformal extensions match the conformal extensions obtained from the mass\u0002less Poincaré side, meaning that:\r
The massless ⇐⇒ conformal correspondence\r
survives passage from flat spacetime to dS and anti-dS backgrounds,\r
the only difference being that in dS the energy sign is undefined,\r
while in anti-dS helicity is ambiguous.\r
1.2.3 Wigner’s Theory in de Sitter (dS) Spacetime: From Quantum\r
Structure to Cosmological Dynamics\r
This work focuses on massless (ladder) representations in conformal space, and in\r
particular on their restriction to 3 + 1-dimensional dS spacetime, whose symmetry\r
structure governs both the earliest [26] and asymptotic [27, 28] stages of cosmic evo\u0002lution. During the inflationary epoch (≈ 10−36 to 10−32 seconds after the Big Bang),\r
when the Universe underwent rapid quasi-exponential expansion, the Hubble scale\r
vastly exceeded all intrinsic mass scales, rendering all elementary systems effectively\r
massless. In this regime, dS symmetry together with conformal symmetry provides\r
the natural framework for their consistent description. Inflationary (massless) ele\u0002mentary systems are realized through ladder representations of the conformal group\r
U(2, 2), which, upon restriction to the dS subgroup Sp(2, 2), rigorously encode the

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations7\r
quantum degrees of freedom of these fields. This representation-theoretic structure\r
underlies the near-scale invariance of primordial fluctuations that seeded cosmic\r
structure and, more generally, furnishes a canonical, symmetry-based classification\r
of inflationary quantum states via UIRs.\r
Moreover, at late times, observations of distant Type Ia supernovae [27, 28]\r
reveal that the Universe is accelerating, a phenomenon attributed to “dark energy”.\r
A small, positive cosmological constant Λ naturally models this acceleration, making\r
dS geometry both the vacuum state and the asymptotic attractor of the Universe.\r
Accordingly, dS spacetime remains a central arena for QFT in curved back\u0002grounds, offering deep insights at the interface of quantum physics, gravity, and\r
cosmology. Across both early- and late-time cosmology, massless systems gov\u0002erned by conformal symmetry form a unifying thread. Ladder representations of\r
U(2, 2) provide a coherent and mathematically precise description of massless field\r
dynamics, encompassing both the inflationary quantum fluctuations that seeded cos\u0002mic structure and the behavior of fields in the late-time accelerated Universe. This\r
representation-theoretic framework thus directly links quantum symmetries to ob\u0002servable cosmological phenomena, highlighting their continuous and fundamental\r
role throughout cosmic evolution.\r
1.2.4 Research Objectives\r
Motivated by the considerations described above, this monograph forms part of a\r
broader program (see Ref. [29] and references therein) to develop a mathematically\r
rigorous, representation-theoretic account of elementary systems in dS spacetime\r
grounded in Wigner’s principle. The present work concentrates on the conceptually\r
rich realm of massless elementary systems in dS spacetime and their intimate re\u0002lation to conformal symmetry. Although the embedding SO0 (4, 1) ↩→ U(2, 2) (via\r
the covering Sp(2, 2)) is well known, the representation-theoretic and physical con\u0002sequences of this embedding — particularly for massless (ladder) representations —\r
deserve a focused, algebraically explicit treatment.\r
Rather than remaining solely within an abstract group framework based on U(2, 2)\r
(as already studied in Ref. [13]), this study adopts the conformal Clifford algebra\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) as the primary algebraic language. Far beyond a mere change of notation,\r
the Clifford framework provides concrete spinorial and geometric tools, sharpening\r
both conceptual understanding and practical computations. Concretely, we construct\r
an explicit real-matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) on 8-component Majorana spinors\r
via an embedding rooted in the alternative composition split-octonion algebra.\r
Interpreting the 8 split-octonion units as left-regular multiplication operators on\r
the split-octonion space produces an algebra of linear endomorphisms naturally\r
realized as 8 × 8 real matrices. By virtue of alternativity — encapsulated by the\r
Moufang identities — left multiplication by a suitably chosen set of 6 of the 8 split\u0002octonion units yields a coherent and internally consistent system of operators which\r
furnishes a realization of the 8-component Majorana gamma matrices associated with

81 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2). Since composition of endomorphisms is strictly associative, the Clifford\r
relations are faithfully reproduced in this setting, and one thereby obtains a canonical\r
associative matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The resulting embedding, however, is\r
not an algebra homomorphism in the strict sense; in general, 𝐿𝐴𝐵 ≠ 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵, reflecting\r
the intrinsic nonassociativity of the underlying octonionic product.\r
This is indeed a deliberate, conceptual choice. The alternative split-octonionic\r
embedding preserves the intrinsic multiplicative relations of the composition alge\u0002bra while furnishing a geometrically natural — and strikingly economical — route\r
to the real gamma matrices and spinor multiplications employed throughout this\r
work. More than a mere calculational convenience, the construction unifies alge\u0002braic, spinorial, and geometric structures into a single framework, directly tying the\r
spinorial degrees of freedom to the deeper architecture of the composition algebra.\r
This split-octonionic realization also furnishes a unified framework in which\r
both the conformal and dS Lie algebras, together with their groups, are embedded\r
explicitly within 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The conformal algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) arises from\r
commutators of bivectors in the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1), and the\r
Clifford pseudoscalar generates the central 𝔲(1), yielding the full conformal Lie\r
algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1). On the other hand, exponentiating these gener\u0002ators produces invertible group elements of U(2, 2). Similarly, the dS Lie algebra\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 1) appears as a subalgebra whose exponentials generate elements of Sp(2, 2).\r
Since the exponential power series converges within the finite-dimensional Clifford\r
algebra and, for bivectors, reduces to closed ‘cos/sin’ or ‘cosh/sinh’ forms, every\r
group operation — including multiplication, inversion, and action on spinors —\r
occurs entirely within the Clifford framework. This structure provides an explicit,\r
efficient, and fully representation-theoretic platform for computing invariant bilinear\r
forms, ladder operators, spectra, and other quantities, keeping both conformal and\r
dS symmetries manifest and fully intertwined, with the conformal structure realized\r
in a way that is simultaneously algebraic and spinorial. Moreover, 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) naturally\r
accommodates both spinorial and tensorial representations, so the same algebraic\r
machinery describes fields of arbitrary helicity. This unification simplifies the con\u0002struction of ladder representations and the explicit realization of their restrictions to\r
dS symmetry.\r
In short, by grounding the spinorial construction in the rich structure of split\u0002octonions, the framework furnishes a unified, explicit, and computationally power\u0002ful toolbox for the study of massless conformal systems. At the same time, it points\r
toward deeper algebraic connections — notably to alternative and exceptional struc\u0002tures — that may underlie the organization of massless fields in curved spacetime.\r
In this context, the concrete objectives of the project are therefore:\r
1. To construct an explicit Majorana representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) on 8-component\r
spinors using the split-octonion algebra — naturally embedding the full confor\u0002mal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) — and relating it to the chiral basis; the Majorana (real)\r
basis and the chiral basis are two distinct realizations of the same real Clifford\r
algebra, requiring no complexification.\r
2. To construct and classify massless ladder (positive-energy) representations of\r
U(2, 2) using the explicit Majorana-split-octonionic realization of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2).

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations9\r
3. To analyze the restriction of these representations to the dS group Sp(2, 2) \u001B\r
SO0 (4, 1), demonstrating the continuity of Wigner-type classification under\r
curvature and computing invariant structures such as Casimirs, bilinear forms,\r
and lowest-weight data.\r
1.2.5 Layout, Main Notational Conventions, and Comprehensive\r
References\r
1.2.5.1 Layout\r
To achieve our goal, the remainder of this monograph is organized as follows:\r
1. The remainder of this chapter offers a concise overview of dS relativity, including\r
the dS group and its manifold, the corresponding Lie algebra, and the quantum\r
framework formulated in terms of dS UIRs.\r
2. Chap. 2 constructs an explicit Majorana representation of the conformal Clifford\r
algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) using split-octonions, providing a geometrically transparent\r
framework for the internal symmetries of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2):\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) .\r
It introduces a unitary transformation to the chiral basis, in which the Cartan\r
elements of the maximal compact subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) are diagonal simul\u0002taneously with the 𝔲(1) generator defined by the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) volume form, and\r
systematically derives inner-product relations among matrices. These results\r
provide a coherent, geometrically grounded framework for the study of massless\r
conformal systems in flat Minkowski spacetime as well as in curved dS and\r
anti-dS spacetimes.\r
3. Chap. 3 develops a rigorous framework for positive-energy ladder represen\u0002tations of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2), realized as quantized models of\r
massless fields with arbitrary helicity in 4-dimensional Minkowski, dS, and\r
anti-dS spacetimes. The construction is based on an invariant bilinear form on\r
the Majorana-spinor space of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and an explicit 4 × 4 spinorial matrix\r
realization arising from the isomorphism 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1), providing a\r
concrete geometric and computational foundation for conformal symmetry, lad\u0002der operators, and spectral analysis. The resulting lowest-weight representations\r
are classified by conformal energy and helicity, remain irreducible upon restric\u0002tion to the dS subalgebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1), and admit an embedding into\r
4-dimensional conformal vertex algebras that exposes their analytic structure,\r
Casimir invariants, and a unified treatment of massless conformal systems in\r
both flat and curved settings.\r
4. Chap. 4 constructs low-helicity conformal massless fields, focusing on the zero\u0002helicity case in dS spacetime. Massless scalar fields are formulated via ladder\u0002type vertex operators with Bose operators and zero modes, ensuring correct

lowest-energy states and canonical two-point function, with analytic properties\r
established in a precompact tube domain. The construction restricts fields from\r
6-dimensional conformal space to 4-dimensional dS spacetime using homo\u0002geneous light-cone functions, capturing gauge freedom and relating Euclidean\r
and Minkowski-type coordinates via Weyl rescaling. The conformally invariant\r
6-dimensional two-point function then projects onto dS spacetime, reproducing\r
the standard massless scalar two-point function.\r
Fig. 1.3 Nested hierarchy of algebraic structures illustrating the relationships among Clifford and\r
Lie algebras relevant to the conformal and spin groups in signature (4, 2). The full Clifford algebra\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) contains its even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1), which in turn includes the Lie algebra\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1). The special unitary algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) is isomorphic to the conformal\r
algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and contains the dS subalgebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1).\r
1.2.5.2 Main Notational Conventions\r
Our main notational conventions are:\r
1. Throughout this monograph, we adopt natural units by setting 𝑐 = ℏ = 1, where\r
𝑐 denotes the speed of light and ℏ the Planck constant.\r
2. We use the symbol ‘1’ to denote the identity element within the relevant alge\u0002braic framework. In composition algebras, it represents the distinguished unit\r
element that preserves the norm under multiplication; for complex numbers,\r
quaternions, and (split) octonions, ‘1’ indicates the multiplicative identity. In\r
matrix representations, it corresponds to the identity matrix of the appropriate\r
dimension, with indices added when necessary for clarity. In Clifford algebras,\r
‘1’ serves as the unit element, ensuring closure under multiplication. The precise\r
interpretation of ‘1’ depends on the specific context in which it appears.

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations11\r
3. We use the ‘ ’ symbol to denote the complex conjugate, while ‘∗\r
’ denotes\r
quaternionic or octonionic conjugation and, depending on context— particularly\r
in matrix representations — also the Hermitian conjugate; for a matrix 𝔐, one\r
has:\r
𝔐∗ =\r
\r
𝔐\r
\u0001⊤\r
,\r
where ‘⊤’ denotes transposition.\r
4. We adopt the following conventions for the split-octonion units and their asso\u0002ciated indices:\r
a. The set of split-octonion units is denoted by:\r
𝐴 and/or 𝐵 = 1 , 𝒌 , 𝚤 , 𝚥 , ℓ𝚤 , 𝚥ℓ , ℓ𝒌 , ℓ .\r
b. The subset:\r
𝜈 and/or 𝜇 = 𝚤 , 𝚥 , ℓ𝚤 , 𝚥ℓ , ℓ𝒌 , ℓ . (1.1)\r
It must be emphasized, however, that the symbols 𝐴, 𝐵 (and hence the\r
indices 𝜈, 𝜇) have a dual interpretation depending on context. They may\r
represent actual split-octonion units in the algebra, or serve merely as la\u0002bels or indices for the corresponding operators or matrix representations\r
(𝐿𝐴, 𝑆𝐴𝐵, 𝐸𝐴𝐵, 𝐷𝐴𝐵, 1𝐴𝐵, 𝑚𝜇, 𝑚𝜇𝜈, Γ𝜇, Γ𝜇𝜈, 𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜇𝜈, . . . ), with no octo\u0002nionic meaning. In the latter case, whenever it aids readability without compro\u0002mising clarity, we adopt a streamlined notation by representing the indices 𝜈\r
and/or 𝜇, respectively, as:\r
𝜈 and/or 𝜇 = 0 (:= 𝚤) , 5 (:= 𝚥) ,\r
1 (:= ℓ𝚤) , 2 (:= 𝚥ℓ) , 3 (:= ℓ𝒌) , 4 (:= ℓ) .\r
We denote any subset of indices 𝜈 and/or 𝜇, typically 1, 2, 3, 4, by 𝑖, 𝑗. Never\u0002theless, each symbol should be interpreted according to its context. This dual\r
interpretation is discussed in Sect. 2.2, Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62).\r
5. In the context of the chiral representation, we denote:\r
𝑎±and/or 𝑏± = 1c𝒌± , c05± , c12± , c34± .\r
For clarity and conciseness, we shall, where appropriate, employ a simplified\r
numeric labeling in Chaps. 3 and 4 as:\r
𝑎 := 𝑎+ = 1\r
\r
:= 1c𝒌+\r
\u0001\r
, 2\r
\r
:= c05+\r
\u0001\r
, 3\r
\r
:= c12+\r
\u0001\r
, 4\r
\r
:= c34+\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Note that 𝑎, 𝑏 have a fundamentally different meaning from 𝑖, 𝑗.\r
6. We denote indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 by Greek letters 𝛼, 𝛽, . . . , and indices 0, 1, 2, 3 by\r
dotted letters 𝜇,¤ 𝜈, . . . ¤ .

12 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
7. The framework of this monograph rests on the mostly positive metric signature,\r
which will serve as our convention from the outset.\r
8. Throughout this monograph, the symbol ‘\u001B’ denotes an isomorphism (or ho\u0002momorphism) between algebras or groups. By a slight abuse of notation, the\r
same symbol is also used to indicate a homeomorphism or continuous homo\u0002morphism between groups or topological spaces. Whenever the precise nature\r
of the correspondence is relevant, it will be explicitly stated in the text.\r
9. In this monograph, various operators are represented as block-diagonal matrices\r
assembled from finite-dimensional matrix blocks (typically 2 × 2 or 4 × 4). To\r
describe such objects unambiguously, we use the following notation:\r
a. Direct-sum notation: For any ordered list of matrices (𝑀1, 𝑀2, . . . , 𝑀𝑛),\r
we write:\r
Ê\r
𝑀1 + 𝑀2 + · · · + 𝑀𝑛\r
\u0001\r
:= 𝑀1 ⊕ 𝑀2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ 𝑀𝑛 , (1.2)\r
for the block-diagonal matrix whose diagonal blocks, in the order listed, are\r
𝑀1, 𝑀2, . . . , 𝑀𝑛. For example:\r
Ê\r
𝑀1 + 𝑀2 + 𝑀3 + 𝑀4\r
\u0001\r
=\r
©\r
­\r
­\r
­\r
«\r
𝑀1 0 0 0\r
0 𝑀2 0 0\r
0 0 𝑀3 0\r
0 0 0 𝑀4\r
ª\r
®\r
®\r
®\r
¬\r
. (1.3)\r
A minus sign in the list indicates literal multiplication of the corresponding\r
block by −1; for instance, É 𝑀1 − 𝑀2 + 𝑀3 + 𝑀4\r
\u0001\r
places −𝑀2 in the\r
second block. This convention allows expressions such as:\r
Ê\r
𝑆1(𝚥ℓ) + 𝑆𝚥 ℓ − 𝑆𝚤(ℓ𝒌) + 𝑆𝒌 (ℓ𝚤)\r
\u0001\r
(1.4)\r
to be written compactly and without ambiguity.\r
b. Commutativity up to isomorphism: For finite-dimensional matrices 𝑀 and\r
𝑁, the direct sum is not strictly commutative as a matrix identity. The two\r
block arrangements differ only by a permutation of components, so that:\r
Ê\r
𝑀 + 𝑁\r
\u0001\r
:= 𝑀 ⊕ 𝑁 \u001B 𝑁 ⊕ 𝑀 =:\r
Ê\r
𝑁 + 𝑀\r
\u0001\r
, (1.5)\r
where “\u001B” denotes isomorphism via conjugation by an appropriate permu\u0002tation matrix.\r
In the present context, however, the blocks are arranged such that their order\r
does not affect the resulting operator. That is, for the matrices considered\r
here, the direct sum is literally commutative:\r
Ê\r
𝑀 + 𝑁\r
\u0001\r
:= 𝑀 ⊕ 𝑁 = 𝑁 ⊕ 𝑀 =:\r
Ê\r
𝑁 + 𝑀\r
\u0001\r
. (1.6)\r
and blocks may be reordered freely without changing the outcome.

[91]. Connections between representation theory and analytic function theory\r
on symmetric spaces, which provide a broader geometric framework for such\r
correlation functions, are explored in the seminal work of Piatetski-Shapiro [92].\r
1.3 Brief on de Sitter (dS) Relativity: Symmetry Group, Lie\r
Algebra, and Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIRs)\r
For future reference and to ensure internal consistency, this section provides a concise\r
overview of dS relativity, covering the dS group and its manifold, the corresponding

Lie algebra, and their quantum counterparts — the dS UIRs that characterize ele\u0002mentary systems in dS spacetime. For a more comprehensive and detailed treatment,\r
readers are directed to the companion monograph [29] and the references therein.\r
1.3.1 Symmetry Group and Lie Algebra\r
As noted earlier, dS spacetime is the unique maximally symmetric solution to Ein\u0002stein’s equations with a positive cosmological constant Λ. Its topology is given by\r
R\r
1 × S3\r
, reflecting that the manifold admits a global foliation by Cauchy hyper\u0002surfaces diffeomorphic to S\r
3\r
. No canonical choice of temporal direction exists; the\r
R\r
1\r
factor merely parametrizes the leaves of this foliation. Geometrically, it is a\r
globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifold with constant positive curvature, uniquely\r
characterized by a curvature radius 𝑅, which sets the fundamental length scale of\r
the spacetime and governs both its geometric and group-theoretic properties.\r
The dS manifold admits a convenient representation as a hyperboloid embedded\r
in a 4 + 1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime R\r
4,1\r
, and is defined by:\r
dS :=\r
n\r
𝑥 = (𝑥\r
𝛼\r
) ∈ R\r
4,1\r
; (𝑥)\r
2\r
:= 𝑥 · 𝑥 = 𝜂𝛼𝛽𝑥\r
𝛼\r
𝑥\r
𝛽 = 𝑅2\r
o\r
, (1.7)\r
where 𝛼, 𝛽 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, the coordinates 𝑥\r
𝛼 are Cartesian, and the ambient\r
Minkowski metric 𝜂𝛼𝛽 has the signature (−, +, +, +, +).\r
Remark 1.1 In this monograph, as already mentioned, we adopt a mostly positive\r
metric signature, departing from the convention used in the previous monograph\r
[29]. Far from being a mere change of notation, this choice is motivated by a deeper\r
conceptual reason; it allows for a consistent embedding of all subsequent group and\r
algebraic constructions into the alternative split-octonion algebra, a point that will\r
be clarified naturally at the appropriate places throughout the exposition. □\r
Remark 1.2 From a cosmological perspective, the curvature radius 𝑅 is typically\r
associated with the inverse of the Hubble parameter H, modulo a factor accounting\r
for physical dimensions:\r
𝑅 =\r
√︂\r
3\r
Λ\r
=\r
1\r
H\r
. (1.8)\r
The Hubble parameter H quantifies the exponential expansion rate of the spatial\r
sections in dS spacetime. □\r
The dS relativity group SO0 (4, 1) — or its universal covering group Sp(2, 2)\r
— is a ten-parameter group of linear transformations acting on the ambient\r
4 + 1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime R\r
4,1\r
. These transformations preserve the\r
quadratic form (𝑥)\r
2 = 𝜂𝛼𝛽𝑥𝛼𝑥𝛽\r

. A standard realization of the corresponding Lie\r
algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) \u001B 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) is given by the linear span of ten Killing vector fields:

𝐾𝛼𝛽 = 𝑥𝛼𝜕𝛽 − 𝑥𝛽𝜕𝛼 , (1.9)\r
where 𝜕𝛼 := 𝜕/𝜕𝑥𝛼.\r
1.3.2 Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIRs)\r
At the representation level, the ten dS Killing vectors (1.9) correspond to (essen\u0002tially) self-adjoint operators 𝐽𝛼𝛽 acting on a Hilbert space of (spinor-)tensor-valued\r
functions on the dS manifold (1.7), square-integrable with respect to a dS-invariant\r
inner product of Klein-Gordon type (or a suitable alternative):\r
𝐾𝛼𝛽 ↦−→ 𝐽𝛼𝛽 = 𝑀𝛼𝛽 + 𝑆𝛼𝛽 , (1.10)\r
where the orbital part is defined by 𝑀𝛼𝛽 = −i(𝑥𝛼𝜕𝛽 − 𝑥𝛽𝜕𝛼), while the spinorial\r
part 𝑆𝛼𝛽 acts on the indices of the (spinor-)tensor-valued functions according to a\r
specific permutation scheme [29].\r
In this context, there are two Casimir operators:\r

−\r
1\r
8\r
𝜀𝛼𝛽𝛾𝜌 𝛿 𝐽\r
𝛽𝛾 𝐽𝜌 𝛿, while 𝜀𝛼𝛽𝛾𝜌 𝛿 is the five-dimensional totally antisymmetric Levi\u0002Civita symbol. These Casimir operators commute with all generator representatives\r
𝐽𝛼𝛽, and hence, act like constants on all states in a certain dS UIR. Therefore, the\r
eigenvalues assumed by the Casimir operators can be utilized to classify UIRs of the\r
dS group. In the Dixmier notation [93], these eigenvalues are expressed in terms of\r
two dS-invariant parameters, 𝑝 ∈ Z≥0/2 and 𝑞 ∈ C, as follows:\r

\r
C\r
𝔰𝔭(2,2)\r

\r
C\r
𝔰𝔭(2,2)\r
4\r
\u000B\r
= −𝑝(𝑝 + 1)𝑞(𝑞 − 1) . (1.14)\r
Thus, the pair of dS-invariant parameters (𝑝, 𝑞) provides a complete characterization\r
of the UIRs of the dS group. The classification naturally decomposes according to\r
the admissible domains of these parameters, leading to three distinguished series of\r
dS UIRs — principal, complementary, and discrete — as reviewed below (see Refs.\r
[93, 94, 29]).\r
Remark 1.3 The Casimir eigenvalues remain invariant under the transformation\r
𝑞 ↦−→ 1 − 𝑞. In other words, the representations labeled by the pairs (𝑝, 𝑞) and

(𝑝, 1 − 𝑞) possess identical Casimir spectra. By definition, such representations are\r
said to be Weyl equivalent. □\r

Majorana Representation of the Conformal\r
Clifford Algebra 𝖈𝖑(4, 2) and its Chiral\r
Counterpart\r
Abstract This chapter presents an explicit Majorana representation of the conformal\r
Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) on 8-component real spinors, drawing on the rich algebraic\r
structure of the split-octonions — an 8-dimensional composition algebra constructed\r
via the Cayley-Dickson process. The discussion begins with a clear and systematic\r
overview of the number systems, which naturally leads to the octonions; complex\r
numbers and quaternions. Particular emphasis is placed on the Moufang identities,\r
which capture alternativity, a relaxed form of associativity that remains fully com\u0002patible with spinor calculus. In the split-octonion setting, alternativity coexists with\r
nonassociativity, creating a subtle but well-controlled framework in which spinorial\r
multiplications retain internal coherence. By exploiting left multiplication by a suit\u0002ably chosen set of 6 of the 7 imaginary split-octonion units, the chapter develops\r
a real-matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) that is both geometrically transparent and\r
ideally suited to the Majorana formalism. This construction provides a unified al\u0002gebraic framework for the internal symmetries of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2)\r
and naturally realizes the embedding chain:\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) ,\r
where the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) pseudoscalar (volume form) generates the 𝔲(1) center of 𝔲(2, 2).\r
Building on this foundation, the chapter investigates the complex structure in\u0002herent in 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its action on spinor space, using the simpler 𝔠𝔩(2) case as an\r
instructive prototype. We emphasize that the Majorana (real) basis and the chiral\r
basis are merely two alternative bases of the same real Clifford algebra; no complex\u0002ification is required. Exploiting this insight, a unitary transformation is constructed\r
that maps the real-matrix basis of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) to the chiral basis, in which the Cartan\r
elements of the maximal compact subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2), together with the 𝔲(1)\r
generator defined by the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) volume form, assume a diagonal form. These re\u0002sults furnish a coherent, geometrically grounded framework for the study of massless\r
conformal systems, applicable in flat Minkowski spacetime as well as in curved de\r
Sitter (dS) and anti-dS spacetimes.\r

20 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
2.1 Composition Algebras, Cayley-Dickson Construction, and\r
Moufang Identities\r
A composition algebra 𝔄, defined over the real numbers R, is a finite-dimensional\r
real vector space endowed with the following structures:\r
1. Norm form: A nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩ ; 𝔄 × 𝔄 ↦−→ R,\r
which satisfies the following properties:\r
a. Symmetry, meaning that ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑦, 𝑥⟩, for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄.\r
b. Nondegeneracy, implying that the map 𝑥 ↦−→ ⟨𝑥, ·⟩ is injective. [In other\r
words, if ⟨·, ·⟩ is a nondegenerate bilinear form on 𝔄 and ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥\r
′\r
, 𝑦⟩,\r
for all 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄, then 𝑥 = 𝑥\r
′\r
. To see this, let 𝑧 = 𝑥 − 𝑥\r
′\r
. Then, for all 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄, we\r
have ⟨𝑧, 𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ − ⟨𝑥\r
′\r
, 𝑦⟩ = 0. By the nondegeneracy of ⟨·, ·⟩, we obtain\r
𝑧 = 0, and hence, 𝑥 = 𝑥\r
′\r
.]\r
This bilinear form induces a quadratic form:\r
𝑁(𝑥) := ⟨𝑥, 𝑥⟩ , (2.1)\r
referred to as the “norm” on 𝔄.\r
2. Bilinear product: A bilinear product ⋄ ; 𝔄 × 𝔄 ↦−→ 𝔄, denoted by 𝑥 ⋄ 𝑦 =: 𝑥𝑦,\r
satisfying the norm composition property:\r
𝑁(𝑥𝑦) = 𝑁(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦) , (2.2)\r
for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄. [This multiplicative property guarantees that every nonzero ele\u0002ment in 𝔄 has a well-defined inverse, making composition algebras particularly\r
valuable in physics and geometry for modeling norm-preserving transforma\u0002tions, such as rotations and symmetry operations. Since rotations are inherently\r
reversible, the existence of inverses ensures that applying a rotation and then\r
its inverse restores an object to its original position. Moreover, this property\r
ensures that multiplication in the algebra preserves norms; for any two elements\r
𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄, their product 𝑥𝑦 satisfies 𝑁(𝑥𝑦) = 𝑁(𝑥)𝑁(𝑦), meaning multiplication\r
does not alter the individual norms but only affects orientation.]\r
3. Unit element: A distinguished element 1 ∈ 𝔄 (the unit), satisfying 1𝑥 = 𝑥1 = 𝑥,\r
for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝔄. From the above, it is clear that 𝑁(1) = 1. Subsequently, for each\r
𝜚 ∈ R (i.e., the members of the field), we have 𝑁(𝜚1) = 𝜚\r
2\r
.\r
Considering the above, one can readily verify the following identity:\r
⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
𝑁(𝑥 + 𝑦) − 𝑁(𝑥) − 𝑁(𝑦)\r
\u0001\r
, (2.3)\r
for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄, which expresses the bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩ in terms of the quadratic\r
norm 𝑁. As a direct consequence of this identity, together with the norm composition\r
property (2.2), it follows that:

2.1 Composition Algebras, Cayley-Dickson Construction, and Moufang Identities 21\r
⟨𝑧𝑥, 𝑧𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥𝑧, 𝑦𝑧⟩ = 𝑁(𝑧)⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ , (2.4)\r
again, for all 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 ∈ 𝔄. The identity (2.4) then immediately yields:\r
⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩⟨𝑧, 𝑤⟩ =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
⟨𝑥𝑧, 𝑦𝑤⟩ + ⟨𝑥𝑤, 𝑦𝑧⟩\r
\u0001\r
, (2.5)\r
for all 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧, 𝑤 ∈ 𝔄. To establish the latter identity, using Eq. (2.4), it suffices to\r
expand the right-hand side:\r
⟨𝑥𝑧, 𝑦𝑤⟩ + ⟨𝑥𝑤, 𝑦𝑧⟩ = ⟨𝑥(𝑧 + 𝑤), 𝑦(𝑧 + 𝑤)⟩ − ⟨𝑥𝑧, 𝑦𝑧⟩ − ⟨𝑥𝑤, 𝑦𝑤⟩\r
= 𝑁(𝑧 + 𝑤)⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ − 𝑁(𝑧)⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩ − 𝑁(𝑤)⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩\r
= ⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩\r
\r
𝑁(𝑧 + 𝑤) − 𝑁(𝑧) − 𝑁(𝑤)\r
\u0001\r
= 2⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩⟨𝑧, 𝑤⟩ . (2.6)\r
On the other hand, substituting 𝑦 by 1 and 𝑧 by 𝑥 into Eq. (2.5), and applying\r
(2.4), we obtain:\r
⟨𝑥, 1⟩⟨𝑥, 𝑤⟩ =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
⟨𝑥\r
2\r
, 𝑤⟩ + 𝑁(𝑥)⟨𝑤, 1⟩\r
\u0001\r
, (2.7)\r
or equivalently:\r

\r
𝑥\r
2 + 𝑁(𝑥)1 − 2⟨𝑥, 1⟩ 𝑥 , 𝑤\u000B\r
= 0 . (2.8)\r
Then, the nondegeneracy of the bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩ ensures that every element 𝑥 in\r
the composition algebra 𝔄 satisfies the following second-order equation:\r
𝑥\r
2 − Tr(𝑥) 𝑥 + 𝑁(𝑥)1 = 0 , (2.9)\r
where Tr(𝑥) denotes the trace in the composition algebra 𝔄, defined by:\r
Tr(𝑥) = 2⟨𝑥, 1⟩\r
\r
∈ R\r
\u0001\r
. (2.10)\r
By employing Eq. (2.5) alongside the symmetric property of the bilinear form ⟨·, ·⟩,\r
it follows that the trace satisfies the symmetry property:\r
Tr(𝑥𝑦) = 2⟨𝑥𝑦, 1⟩ = 4⟨𝑥, 1⟩⟨𝑦, 1⟩ − 2⟨𝑥, 𝑦⟩\r
= 4⟨𝑦, 1⟩⟨𝑥, 1⟩ − 2⟨𝑦, 𝑥⟩ = 2⟨𝑦𝑥, 1⟩ = Tr(𝑦𝑥) , (2.11)\r
for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄.\r
Within this framework, the Cayley-Dickson conjugate of an element 𝑥 ∈ 𝔄 is\r
defined by:\r
𝑥\r
∗\r
:= Tr(𝑥)1 − 𝑥 . (2.12)\r
Utilizing this identity, one readily verifies that:\r
Tr(𝑥 + 𝑦) = Tr(𝑥) + Tr(𝑦) , (2.13)

22 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝔄.\r
By substituting Tr(𝑥) from Eq. (2.12) into (2.9), we derive the following explicit\r
form for the norm on 𝔄:\r
𝑁(𝑥) = 𝑥\r
∗\r
𝑥 . (2.14)\r
Using the materials mentioned above — specifically Eqs. (2.3) and (2.11)-(2.14),\r
one readily verifies that the Cayley-Dickson conjugation satisfies the following key\r
properties:\r
Additivity ; (𝑥 + 𝑦)\r

A fundamental result, known as the Hurwitz theorem, constrains the possible\r
dimensions of composition algebras over R. These algebras can only exist in dimen\u0002sions 1, 2, 4, and 8. The corresponding cases are:\r
1. The real numbers R, which are both commutative and associative.\r
2. The complex numbers C, which are also commutative and associative.\r
3. The quaternions H, which are noncommutative but retain associativity.\r
4. The octonions O, which are neither commutative nor associative.\r
As already mentioned, these algebras serve as essential tools in mathematics and\r
physics, particularly in areas requiring norm-preserving transformations, such as\r
symmetry operations and rotations.\r
To ensure this manuscript is self-contained, the following subsections will delve\r
deeper into the structure and properties of the complex numbers, quaternions, and\r
octonions, providing a comprehensive overview of their defining characteristics.

2.1 Composition Algebras, Cayley-Dickson Construction, and Moufang Identities 23\r
2.1.1 Complex Numbers\r
The complex numbers C ∋ 𝑧 = 1𝑧\r
0 + i𝑧1 =: 𝑧0 + i𝑧1\r
are defined in terms of\r
their real components 𝑧\r
0\r
, 𝑧1 ∈ R. The real and imaginary units are denoted by\r
1 = 11 + i0 =: 1 and i, respectively, with the property that i\r
2 = −1. This structure\r
forms a (commutative and associative) composition algebra over the real numbers\r
when equipped with:\r
1. Real bilinear form:\r
⟨𝑧, 𝑤⟩ =\r

\r
𝑧\r
0 + i𝑧1\r
, 𝑤0 + i𝑤\r

0𝑤0 + 𝑧1𝑤1\r
, (2.20)\r
for any 𝑧, 𝑤 ∈ C (𝑧\r
0\r
, 𝑧1, 𝑤0, 𝑤1 ∈ R). The above bilinear form induces the\r
quadratic norm 𝑁(𝑧) = (𝑧\r
0\r
)\r
2 + (𝑧1\r
)\r
2\r
. Moreover, considering Eqs. (2.10) and\r
(2.12), the above bilinear form yields:\r
𝑧 = 𝑧\r
0 + i𝑧1 = 𝑧\r
0 − i𝑧1\r
, (2.21)\r
where the ‘ ’ symbol denotes the complex conjugate.\r

again, for any 𝑧, 𝑤 ∈ C (𝑧\r

, 𝑧1, 𝑤0, 𝑤1 ∈ R). Employing this identity, it is easy to\r
show that 𝑁(𝑧) = 𝑧 𝑧 = 𝑧 𝑧 = 𝑁(𝑧).\r
The product of two (arbitrary) complex numbers 𝑧 and 𝑤 satisfies the norm\r
composition property:\r
𝑁(𝑧𝑤) = 𝑁(𝑧)𝑁(𝑤) . (2.23)\r
To explicitly verify this, observe that:\r
𝑁(𝑧𝑤) =\r
\r
𝑧\r
0𝑤0 − 𝑧1𝑤1\r
\u00012\r
+\r
\r
𝑧\r

0\r
)\r
2 + (𝑤1\r
)\r
2\r
\u0001\r
= 𝑁(𝑧)𝑁(𝑤) . (2.24)\r
This multiplicative property establishes that the complex numbers form a composi\u0002tion algebra, where the multiplication is both commutative and associative.\r
2.1.2 Quaternions: Extending the Complex Numbers\r
Building on the properties of complex numbers, quaternions are a 4-dimensional\r
extension of the number system. Introduced by William Rowan Hamilton in 1843,\r
quaternions are defined as numbers of the form:

, 𝑞1, 𝑞2, 𝑞3∈ R\r
o\r
, (2.25)\r
where 1 = 11 + 𝚤0 + 𝚥0 + 𝒌0 =: 1 is the real unit element, and 𝚤, 𝚥, 𝒌 are the\r
quaternion imaginary units. These units obey the following defining multiplication\r
rules:\r
𝚤 𝚥 = − 𝚥𝚤 = 𝒌 , 𝚥 𝒌 = −𝒌 𝚥 = 𝚤 , 𝒌𝚤 = −𝚤 𝒌 = 𝚥 , (2.26)\r
1𝚤 = 𝚤1 = 𝚤 , 1 𝚥 = 𝚥1 = 𝚥 , 1𝒌 = 𝒌1 = 𝒌 , (2.27)\r
(𝚤)\r
2 = ( 𝚥)2 = (𝒌)2 = −1 =: −1 . (2.28)\r
Then, the multiplication of two quaternions 𝑞 and 𝑝 reads as:\r

where 𝑞\r

, . . . , 𝑞3, 𝑝0, . . . , 𝑝3 ∈ R. The above explanation makes it evident that\r
quaternion multiplication, while associative, is not commutative.\r
Under the conjugation, the imaginary units of the quaternion behave as:\r
(𝚤)\r
∗ = −𝚤 , ( 𝚥)∗ = − 𝚥 , (𝒌)∗ = −𝒌 , and, of course, (1)∗ = 1 =: 1 . (2.30)\r
Then, the squared norm of a quaternion 𝑞 is given by:\r
𝑁(𝑞) = 𝑞\r

and, subsequently, the inverse of a nonzero quaternion 𝑞 by:\r

𝑞\r

𝑁(𝑞)\r
. (2.32)\r
The latter identity is a clear consequence of the multiplicative property of the com\u0002position algebras we discussed earlier.

2.1.3 (Split) Octonions: Beyond Associativity\r
The octonions O and split octonions OS are 8-dimensional, noncommutative, and\r
nonassociative composition algebras over the real numbers R. They are constructed\r
via the Cayley-Dickson process by extending the quaternions H with an additional\r
imaginary unit ℓ. The defining property of this unit distinguishes the octonions O\r
from their split counterpart OS:\r
O(S) =\r
n\r
𝑜 = 𝑞 + ℓ𝑝 ; 𝑞, 𝑝 ∈ H , and (ℓ)\r
2 =\r
\r
\r
\r
−1 =: −1 for 𝑜 ∈ O\r
+1 =: +1 for 𝑜 ∈ OS\r
o\r
, (2.33)\r
where O(S) denotes either O or OS. Note that, by definition, the term “imaginary\r
unit” refers to an element whose square is −1. However, in the context of the split\u0002octonions OS, the extra unit ℓ — satisfying (ℓ)\r
2 = +1 — is also commonly (though\r
imprecisely) referred to as an imaginary unit, by abuse of notation.\r
The (split)-octonion algebras are endowed with the following operations for all\r
𝑞1, 𝑝1, 𝑞2, 𝑝2∈ H:\r
1. Addition:\r
\r
𝑞1 + ℓ𝑝1\r
\u0001\r
+\r
\r
𝑞2 + ℓ𝑝2\r

𝑞1 + 𝑞2\r
\u0001\r
+ ℓ\r
\r
𝑝1 + 𝑝2\r
\u0001\r
. (2.34)\r
2. Multiplication: Obeying the norm composition property (2.2), the product of\r
two octonions reads as:1\r
\r
𝑞1 + ℓ𝑝1\r
\u0001 𝑞2 + ℓ𝑝2\u0001\r
= 𝑞1𝑞2 + (ℓ)\r
2\r

1 + ℓ\r
\r
𝑞\r
∗\r
1\r
𝑝2 + 𝑞2𝑝1\r
\u0001\r
. (2.35)\r
3. Conjugation:\r
(𝑞 + ℓ𝑝)\r
∗ = 𝑞\r
∗ − ℓ𝑝 , (hence ℓ∗ = −ℓ) . (2.36)\r
Note that, considering the anticommutativity of conjugation with respect to mul\u0002tiplication (see Eq. (2.18)), this identity directly implies the following essential\r
relations:\r
𝑝\r
∗\r
ℓ = ℓ𝑝 , (2.37)\r
for all 𝑝 ∈ H, which highlight the interplay between the quaternionic components\r
and the additional imaginary unit ℓ.\r
Using the octonionic conjugation (2.36) and the multiplication rule (2.35), the\r
norm of a (split) octonion can be expressed as:\r
𝑁(𝑞 + ℓ𝑝) = (𝑞 + ℓ𝑝) (𝑞 + ℓ𝑝)\r
∗ = 𝑁(𝑞) − (ℓ)2𝑁(𝑝) , (2.38)\r
1 For a mnemonic matrix rule for (split) octonionic multiplication, see Appendix 2.5.

26 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
where, as we already discussed, 𝑁(𝑞) = 𝑞𝑞∗ = 𝑞\r
∗𝑞 is the quaternionic norm. This\r
leads to the following key distinctions:\r
1. For the octonions O, where (ℓ)\r
2 = −1 =: −1, the norm is positive-definite:\r
𝑁 (𝑞 + ℓ𝑝) = 𝑁 (𝑞) + 𝑁 (𝑝) . (2.39)\r
This makes O a division algebra, as every nonzero element is invertible.\r
2. For the split octonions OS, where (ℓ)\r
2 = +1 =: +1, the norm is indefinite (with\r
the signature (4, 4)):\r
𝑁 (𝑞 + ℓ𝑝) = 𝑁 (𝑞) − 𝑁 (𝑝) . (2.40)\r
The indefinite norm allows for zero divisors, preventing the algebra from forming\r
a division algebra.\r
2.1.3.1 Alternativity\r
It must be emphasized that the resulting (split) octonion algebras are nonassociative\r
and, more precisely, are classified as alternative algebras. While (split) octonions are\r
not associative, their alternativity ensures that certain partial forms of associativity\r
are preserved when elements are repeated. In particular:\r
𝑜(𝒏 𝑜) = (𝑜 𝒏)𝑜 , (2.41)\r
𝑜\r
∗\r
(𝒏 𝑜) = (𝑜\r
∗𝒏)𝑜 , (2.42)\r
for all 𝒏, 𝑜 ∈ O(S). Furthermore, the (split) octonions adhere to the key left, right,\r
and central Ruth Moufang identities [82], which are given respectively as:\r
𝑜\r
\r
𝒎 (𝑜 𝒏)\r
\u0001\r
= (𝑜 𝒎 𝑜)𝒏 , (2.43)\r
\r
(𝒎 𝑜) 𝒏 𝑜\r
\u0001\r
= 𝒎(𝑜 𝒏 𝑜) , (2.44)\r
(𝑜 𝒎) (𝒏 𝑜) = 𝑜(𝒎 𝒏)𝑜 , (2.45)\r
for all 𝒎, 𝒏, 𝑜 ∈ O(S).\r
By invoking the quaternion imaginary units 𝚤, 𝚥, and 𝒌, let us revisit the (split)\r
octonion definition (2.33). The structure naturally extends to include seven distinct\r
imaginary units, which we can explicitly enumerate as:\r
𝚤, 𝚥, 𝒌, ℓ, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ = −ℓ 𝚥\u0001, ℓ𝒌 . (2.46)

2.1 Composition Algebras, Cayley-Dickson Construction, and Moufang Identities 27\r
These units, together with the real unit 1 = 1 + 𝚤0 + 𝚥0 + . . . + ℓ𝒌0 =: 1, form\r
the full basis of the (split) octonions. Their interplay reflects the noncommutative\r
and nonassociative nature of the algebra, while satisfying the alternativity properties\r
given in Eqs. (2.41)-(2.45). Specifically, the multiplication rules governing these\r
units can be systematically derived from the general structure provided in Eq. (2.35).\r
For the split octonions OS relevant to our study, we have the following convenient\r
multiplication table:\r
𝑥 ⋄ 𝑦 := 𝑥𝑦 1 𝚤 𝚥 𝒌 ℓ ℓ𝚤 𝚥ℓ ℓ𝒌\r
1 1 𝚤 𝚥 𝒌 ℓ ℓ𝚤 𝚥ℓ ℓ𝒌\r
𝚤 𝚤 −1 𝒌 − 𝚥 −ℓ𝚤 ℓ ℓ𝒌 − 𝚥ℓ\r
𝚥 𝚥 −𝒌 −1 𝚤 𝚥ℓ ℓ𝒌 −ℓ −ℓ𝚤\r
𝒌 𝒌 𝚥 −𝚤 −1 −ℓ𝒌 𝚥ℓ −ℓ𝚤 ℓ\r
ℓ ℓ ℓ𝚤 − 𝚥ℓ ℓ𝒌 1 𝚤 − 𝚥 𝒌\r
ℓ𝚤 ℓ𝚤 −ℓ −ℓ𝒌 − 𝚥ℓ −𝚤 1 −𝒌 − 𝚥\r
𝚥ℓ 𝚥ℓ −ℓ𝒌 ℓ ℓ𝚤 𝚥 𝒌 1 −𝚤\r
ℓ𝒌 ℓ𝒌 𝚥ℓ ℓ𝚤 −ℓ −𝒌 𝚥 𝚤 1\r
(2.47)\r
Keeping the focus specifically on the split-octonion algebra relevant to our study,\r
three complementary remarks are in order:\r
Remark 2.1 We observe that:\r
1. The seven imaginary split-octonion units are mutually anticommutative.\r
2. These anticommutative imaginary split-octonion units can be expressed in terms\r
of the product of the three basic elements 𝚤, 𝚥, and ℓ. □\r
Remark 2.2 Analogous to the identities given in Eq. (2.41)-(2.45), any pairs of\r
different imaginary split-octonion units generate an 8-dimensional associative group:\r
1. The pair (𝚤, 𝚥) generates the quaternion subalgebra:\r
\b\r
± 𝚤, ± 𝚥, ±𝒌, ±1\r
\t\r
, (2.48)\r
which is associative by construction. For example:\r
𝚤( 𝚥 𝒌) = (𝚤 𝚥)𝒌 . (2.49)\r
2. Any other pair of distinct imaginary units likewise generates an associative sub\u0002algebra of split-octonions. For instance, the pair (𝚤, 𝚥ℓ) generates the subalgebra:

28 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
\b\r
± 𝚤, ± 𝚥ℓ, ±ℓ𝒌, ±1\r
\t\r
, (2.50)\r
which is again associative. For instance:\r
𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥ℓ) (ℓ𝒌)\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
𝚤( 𝚥ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
(ℓ𝒌) . (2.51)\r
Note: Three imaginary units are said to be independent if they do not belong to an\r
associative subalgebra of the Moufang loop of OS units. For example, the aforemen\u0002tioned three basic elements 𝚤, 𝚥, and ℓ are independent as:\r
\r
(𝚤) ( 𝚥)\r
\u0001\r
ℓ ≠ 𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥) (ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
. (2.52)\r
□\r
Remark 2.3 As an extension of Moufang’s theorem (see Ref. [98]), the loop gener\u0002ated by any three independent elements — for example, 𝚤, 𝚥, and ℓ — indeed forms a\r
“modified” associative finite subalgebra. The corresponding “modified” associative\r
law differs from the standard one by an overall sign, which encodes the nonassocia\u0002tive (in the usual sense) character of the three independent units. For instance, the\r
nonequality in Eq. (2.52) explicitly reads:\r
\r
(𝚤) ( 𝚥)\r
\u0001\r
ℓ = −𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥) (ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
. (2.53)\r
Thus, for any triple of independent (and therefore nonassociative) imaginary split\u0002octonion units, Moufang’s theorem guarantees that seemingly nonintuitive identities\r
can be derived systematically via the “modified” associative law. As a further illus\u0002trative case, let us examine the independent generators ℓ, 𝒌, and 𝚤:\r
\r
(ℓ) (𝒌)\r
\u0001\r
𝚤 = −ℓ\r
\r
(𝒌) (𝚤)\r
\u0001\r
| {z }\r
by “modified” associative law\r
= −ℓ 𝚥 = 𝚥ℓ , (2.54)\r
which is fully consistent with the multiplication table in (2.47).\r
Summary: Any triple of imaginary split-octonion units is either nonindependent,\r
and therefore fully associative, or independent, and thus “modified” associative,\r
with the modification differing from standard associativity by an overall sign. This\r
precisely expresses the principle of alternativity that characterizes the split-octonion\r
algebra. □\r
Proposition 2.1 As a direct consequence of the preceding Remarks, for all 𝒎, 𝒏 ∈\r
OS\\{1} and 𝑜 ∈ OS, one has:\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) =\r
\r
\r
\r
−𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) for 𝒎 ≠ 𝒏\r
𝒎2 𝑜 for 𝒎 = 𝒏\r
. (2.55)\r
Proof — Step I (first case, with nonindependent (associative) units). If 𝒎, 𝒏, 𝑜\r
(with 𝒎 ≠ 𝒏) belong to a nonindependent subalgebra, we have:

2.2 Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) Generated by Left Multiplication of Imaginary Split-Octonion Units29\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) = (𝒎 𝒏) 𝑜 (by standard associative law)\r
= (−𝒏 𝒎) 𝑜 (by anticommutativity of imaginary units)\r
= −𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) (again, by standard associative law) . (2.56)\r
— Step II (first case, with independent (nonassociative) units). If 𝒎, 𝒏, 𝑜 (with\r
𝒎 ≠ 𝒏) form an independent triple, invoking the “modified” associative law from\r
Remark 2.3, we get:\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) = −(𝒎 𝒏) 𝑜 (by “modified” associative law)\r
= −(−𝒏 𝒎) 𝑜 (by anticommutativity of imaginary units)\r
= −𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) (again, by “modified” associative law) . (2.57)\r
— Step III (second case). When 𝒎 = 𝒏, the result follows immediately from\r
alternativity. Indeed, any pair of split-octonion units generates an associative subal\u0002gebra — a direct consequence of Remark 2.2. Therefore:\r
𝒎(𝒎 𝑜) = (𝒎 𝒎) 𝑜 = 𝒎\r
2\r
𝑜 . (2.58)\r
This identity generalizes straightforwardly to repeated multiplications:\r
𝒎\r
\u0010\r
. . . 𝒎(𝒎\r
| {z }\r
𝑟 times\r
𝑜)\r
\u0001\r
. . . \u0011= 𝒎\r
𝑟\r
𝑜 . (2.59)\r
As a direct consequence (setting 𝑜 = 1), powers of a single split-octonion unit are\r
fully associative and therefore well-defined, ensuring that all such repeated products\r
are unambiguous.\r
From the preceding results, it follows that Eq. (2.55) is valid. □\r
2.2 Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝖈𝖑(4, 2) Generated by Left\r
Multiplication of Imaginary Split-Octonion Units\r
Let us define the operators 𝐿𝐴 representing left multiplication by split-octonion units\r
𝐴 acting on the split-octonion algebra OS:\r
𝐿𝐴 𝑥 := 𝐴 𝑥 . (2.60)\r
This definition carries the intrinsic split-octonion multiplication (right-hand side)\r
into a corresponding matrix realization (left-hand side). The symbols 𝐴 and 𝑥 there\u0002fore play a dual role in Eq. (2.60); on the right-hand side, they are elements of the\r
split-octonion algebra, while on the left-hand side 𝐴 functions purely as an index\r
labelling a 8 × 8 matrix operator and 𝑥 is treated as a 8-component column vector

302 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
representing a Dirac-Majorana spinor. Readers should always interpret each symbol\r
according to its position in (2.60). More specifically:\r
1. On the right-hand side of (2.60), the symbols 𝐴 and 𝑥 are to be interpreted\r
strictly as elements of the split-octonion algebra:\r
𝑥 ∈ OS = Spann𝐴 ; 𝐴 = 1, 𝒌, 𝜈, with 𝜈 ∈\r
\b\r
𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌, ℓ\r
\t\r
o\r
. (2.61)\r
2. On the left-hand side of (2.60), by contrast, 𝐴 solely plays the role of an index\r
labelling the associated 8 × 8 matrix operator 𝐿𝐴; no octonionic interpreta\u0002tion is attached to 𝐴 in this position. Correspondingly, 𝑥 is interpreted as an\r
8-component Dirac-Majorana spinor, obtained by identifying OS \u001B R\r
8 with re\u0002spect to the basis above. Each 𝐿𝐴 acts linearly on this spinor space. Accordingly,\r
the operators 𝐿𝐴 can be enumerated as:\r
𝐿𝐴 = 𝐿1, 𝐿𝒌 , 𝐿𝜈, with 𝜈 ∈\r
n\r
0 := 𝚤, 5 := 𝚥, 1 := ℓ𝚤, 2 := 𝚥ℓ, 3 := ℓ𝒌, 4 := ℓ\r
o\r
.\r
(2.62)\r
Remark 2.4 We emphasize that the map 𝐴 ↦−→ 𝐿𝐴 is not an algebra homomor\u0002phism. While the product 𝐴 ⋄ 𝐵 := 𝐴𝐵, with 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 𝜈 ∈ {𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ},\r
is nonassociative (more precisely, alternative), the matrix product 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 is associa\u0002tive.\r
In fact, all nested products of operators 𝐿𝐴 are interpreted as successive left\r
multiplications on 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴}. This convention ensures that, despite the intrinsic\r
nonassociativity of the split-octonions, expressions of the form:\r
𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶 𝑥 = (𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵) (𝐿𝐶 𝑥)\r
= (𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶) 𝑥\r
= 𝐿𝐴(𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶) 𝑥\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
= 𝐿𝐴\r
\r
𝐿𝐵(𝐿𝐶 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝐴\r
\r
𝐵(𝐶 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
(2.63)\r
are fully unambiguous and well-defined. Of course, for brevity, parentheses may oc\u0002casionally be omitted in such expressions, although their presence is always implied\r
by definition.\r
Consequently, we have 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 ≠ 𝐿𝐴𝐵, since 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 𝑥 = 𝐴(𝐵 𝑥) while 𝐿𝐴𝐵 𝑥 =\r
(𝐴𝐵) 𝑥. Nevertheless, in the sequel, we adopt the convenient notation 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 =: 𝐿𝐴𝐵,\r
which is always understood to mean 𝐿𝐴𝐵 𝑥 = 𝐴(𝐵 𝑥). □\r
Let us now denote 6 of the 8 operators 𝐿𝐴, when 𝐴 = 𝜈 = 𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ or\r
simply 𝐴 = 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, by 𝑚𝜈:= 𝐿𝜈. By construction, the set of elements 𝑚𝜈\r
generates the conformal Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) — more precisely, its embedding\r
into the alternative-split-octonion algebra. Specifically, these elements satisfy the\r
following anticommutation relations:

Remark 2.9 It is remarkable that, while the product of any three independent imagi\u0002nary OS units is generally nonassociative, the product of all six 𝜈 = 𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ\r
is associative; that is:\r

Note that:\r
1. This significant observation — that the product of the six imaginary OS units 𝜈\r
is associative — was first made in Cohl Furey’s dissertation [99].\r
2. The sign in Eq. (2.92) (or (2.93)) defines an orientation in R\r
4,2\r
. This orientation\r
is reversed by any odd permutation of the elements and preserved by any even\r
permutation.\r
3. Since 𝐸\r
2\r
\r

\u0001\r
= −1, the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) pseudoscalar defines a complex struc\u0002ture on the 8-dimensional spinor space, a topic we will explore in more detail\r
later.\r
4. There are three pairs of OS units whose product equals −𝒌, specifically (ℓ𝚤) ( 𝚥ℓ) =\r
(ℓ𝒌)ℓ = 𝚥𝚤 = −𝒌. One notices that the corresponding (commuting!) matrices\r
𝑚12, 𝑚34, and 𝑚50 = −𝑚05 are trace-orthogonal to each other as well as to 𝐸.\r
This will also be discussed in more detail later. □\r

form 𝐸 = 𝑀(4, 2) as carried out above — i.e., by substituting 𝑥 with any of the\r

property established in Remark (2.9); this second approch will be of particular utility\r

𝑥 = 𝑀2(4, 2) 𝑥 = −𝒌(−𝒌 𝑥) = (𝒌)\r

𝑥 = −1 𝑥 , (2.99)\r

2.4.\r
4 Then, in view of Eq. (2.95), any representation space 𝔖 of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
splits into two 4-dimensional chiral subspaces:\r
𝔖 = 𝔖+ ⊕ 𝔖− , (2.100)\r
where the complex-conjugate semispinor chiral subspaces 𝔖±\r
\r

\u0001\r
consist of\r
eigenvectors of 𝐸 with eigenvalues ±i, respectively; this point will be discussed\r
explicitly later.\r
Remark 2.11 Completing the discussion begun by Eq. (2.95), note first that the\r
pseudoscalar 𝐸 lies in the center of 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1). In\r
particular, it commutes with every generator 𝑚𝜇𝜈 \r
= −𝑚𝜈𝜇\u0001of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). As a\r
4\r
It is perhaps worthwhile noting that a real skewsymmetric matrix, such as 𝐸 (that is, 𝐸\r
⊤ = −𝐸),\r
is not fully diagonalizable over R. However, if the matrix has an even dimension, it can be brought\r
to a block-diagonal form via an orthogonal transformation. This property is clearly illustrated by\r
the matrix representation (2.96) of 𝐸:\r

where each of the four 2 × 2 blocks corresponds to a pair of imaginary eigenvalues ±i. In contrast,\r
over C, 𝐸 is fully diagonalizable via a similarity transformation 𝑇:\r
𝑇\r
−1𝐸𝑇 = diag(+i, −i, +i, −i, +i, −i, +i, −i) .\r
This confirms that full diagonalization is only possible on a complex basis. The matrix remains\r
8 × 8 in dimension, but it is now fully diagonal over C. For further details, see Ref. [100].

result, the eigenspaces 𝔖± of 𝐸, respectively with eigenvalues ±i (to be shown\r
explicitly later), are separately invariant under 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). We will see that each 𝔖± in\r
fact carries an irreducible 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) representation.\r
On the other hand, because 𝐸 itself also generates the central 𝔲(1) factor in 𝔲(2, 2)\r
and acts on each 𝔖± by a fixed scalar, the full algebra 𝔲(2, 2) likewise preserves these\r
subspaces. Thus, the 8-dimensional 𝔲(2, 2)-module splits cleanly into two invariant\r
4-dimensional pieces, 𝔖 = 𝔖+ ⊕ 𝔖−. Each 𝔖± furnishes an irreducible semispinor\r
representation of 𝔲(2, 2). □\r
In the sequel, we will systematically present the similarity transformation that\r
simultaneously diagonalizes the 𝔲(1) generator 𝐸 (2.96) along with a trace\u0002orthogonal basis5 of the Cartan elements of the maximal compact Lie subalgebra\r
𝔰𝔬(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔬(4) ⊂ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2):\r

𝑚12 𝑥 = 𝑚1(𝑚2𝑥) = ℓ𝚤( 𝚥ℓ 𝑥) =\r
Ê(𝐸1𝒌 − 𝐸05 + 𝐸12 − 𝐸34) 𝑥 , (2.102)\r
𝑚34 𝑥 = 𝑚3(𝑚4𝑥) = ℓ𝒌(ℓ 𝑥) =\r
Ê(𝐸1𝒌 − 𝐸05 − 𝐸12 + 𝐸34) 𝑥 , (2.103)\r
where 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)). Again, for the convention É(. . . ), see\r
Sect. 1.2.5.2. Note that:\r
1. These equations can be readily checked by substituting 𝑥 with any (indeed, with\r
each) of the split-octonion units and referring to the multiplication table (2.47).\r
2. The product of the three Cartan elements (2.101)-(2.103) reconstructs the Clif\u0002ford pseudoscalar (2.96), which serves as the generator of the 𝔲(1) center of\r
𝔲(2, 2).\r
3. Since the matrices 𝑚𝜇𝜈 (2.101)-(2.103) are skewsymmetric, with 𝑚𝜇𝜈 \u00012= −1,\r
7\r
they have pure imaginary eigenvalues.\r
4. These matrices can be diagonalized simultaneously with the complex structure\r
𝐸 (2.96), in a complex chiral basis, since:\r
\u0002\r
𝑚05, 𝑚12\u0003=\r
\u0002\r
𝑚12, 𝑚34\u0003= · · · =\r
\u0002\r
𝑚05, 𝐸\u0003= · · · =\r
\u0002\r
𝑚34, 𝐸\u0003= 0 . (2.104)\r
We shall discuss this diagonalization procedure in detail in the next section.\r
5 See Remark 2.7.\r
6 For the structure of the maximal compact subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), see Appendix 2.7.\r
7 This identity can be verified by a procedure analogous to that used in Eq. (2.91).

2.3 Diagonalizing the Complex Structure of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) in Spinor Space: Insight from the 𝔠𝔩(2) Case39\r
2.3.1 The 𝖈𝖑(2) Case as a Prototype\r
Since all four (commuting) 8×8 skewsymmetric matrices 𝐸 (2.96), 𝑚05 (2.101), 𝑚12\r
(2.102), and 𝑚34 (2.103) can be expressed as direct sums of 2×2 skewsymmetric ma\u0002trices ±𝐸𝐴𝐵 for the same set of index pairs 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ or more\r
conveniently 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)), the simultaneous\r
diagonalization problem of 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34 reduces to a 2-dimensional case\r
within the framework of the Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(2) := 𝔠𝔩(2, 0).\r
8 The 𝔠𝔩(2) Majorana\r
(or real) basis {𝑚1, 𝑚2} and the chiral one {𝜎1, 𝜎2} can be chosen, respectively, as:\r
𝑚1 = 𝜎3 =\r

Here, we must emphasize that {𝑚1, 𝑚2} and {𝜎1, 𝜎2} are two bases in the same\r
real Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(2); no complexification is needed. As a matter of fact, the\r
following unitary similarity transformation relates them:\r
𝜎𝜈¤ = 𝑉𝑚𝜈¤𝑉\r
−1\r
, 𝜈¤ = 1, 2 , (2.107)\r
with:9\r
8 This algebra represents the lowest-dimensional member of the signature-two Clifford algebras\r
𝔠𝔩(𝑛 + 1, 𝑛 − 1), 𝑛 = 1, 2, . . . , in Cartan’s classification.\r
9 Note that the Pauli matrices satisfy the algebraic identity:\r
𝜎𝑖 𝜎𝑗 = 𝛿𝑖 𝑗1 + i𝜀𝑖 𝑗𝑘 𝜎𝑘,\r
where 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 = 1, 2, 3, 𝛿𝑖 𝑗 is the Kronecker delta and 𝜀𝑖 𝑗𝑘 is the Levi-Civita symbol. From this,\r
it follows that:\r
𝜎\r
2𝑛\r
𝑗 = 1 , 𝜎2𝑛+1𝑗 = 𝜎𝑗\r
,\r
for all 𝑛 ∈ N. Using these properties, the matrix exponential of any Pauli matrix takes the form:\r

which is valid for any 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3 and 𝜃 ∈ R.

−\r
\u0013\r

spinors in the context of the 𝔠𝔩(2). We then observe that the right- and left-handed\r
components, denoted by 𝜓\r
±\r
, of the chiral spinor satisfy:\r
𝜓\r
± =\r
\u0012\r

\r

\u0001\r

±\r
. (2.110)\r
Then, 𝜔(2) naturally plays the role of the “chirality operator”, distinguishing the\r
right- from the left-handed spinor components.\r
The reality of the Majorana spinor 𝜉 is encapsulated in the requirement that any\r
unitary transformation, 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉, preserves its invariance under charge conjugation\r
— denoted by the superscript ‘𝑐’ — so that the charge conjugate of the transformed\r
spinor coincides with itself, 𝜓\r
𝑐 = 𝜓. By definition, the charge conjugate of a spinor\r
is given by:\r
𝜓\r
𝑐\r
:= 𝐶 𝜓 , (2.111)\r
where the charge conjugation matrix 𝐶 naturally swaps 𝜓\r
+\r
and 𝜓\r
−\r
, preserving the\r
chirality structure. To ensure consistency, 𝐶 must satisfy the following condition:\r
𝐶 𝜎𝜈¤ = 𝜎𝜈¤ 𝐶 , 𝜈¤ = 1, 2 . (2.112)\r
The former identity implies that𝐶 should commute with the real𝔠𝔩(2) generators and\r
anticommute with the imaginary ones. We notice that the matrix 𝐶 = 𝜚\r
2𝜎1\r
satisfies\r
this condition for any choice of the phase factor 𝜚\r
2\r
; the reason for the exponent ‘2’\r
in 𝜚\r
2 will be clarified in the sequel (see the convention given above Eq. (2.119)).\r
Considering the unitary basis transformation defined by the matrix 𝑉, such that\r
𝜓𝑉= 𝑉𝜓 and 𝜎\r
𝑉\r
𝜈¤\r

−1\r
, Eq. (2.111) becomes:\r

(2.113)

2.3 Diagonalizing the Complex Structure of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) in Spinor Space: Insight from the 𝔠𝔩(2) Case41\r
On the other hand, as previously mentioned, the reality condition of the Majorana\r
spinor 𝜉 ensures that under any unitary transformation 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉, we have:\r
𝜓\r
𝑐\r
\r
= 𝐶 𝜓\r
\u0001\r
= 𝜓 , and similarly 𝜓\r
𝑐\r
𝑉 = 𝜓𝑉\r

𝑐\r
𝑉 = 𝑉\r
\r
𝐶 𝜓\r
\u0001\r
.\r
(2.114)\r
Equating the two expressions for 𝜓\r
𝑐\r
𝑉\r
, we obtain:\r
𝐶𝑉\r
\u0010\r
𝑉\r
−1\r
\u0011⊤\r
𝜓 = 𝑉 𝐶 𝜓 . (2.115)\r
Since this must hold for all 𝜓, the corresponding transformation law for the charge\r
conjugation matrix follows:\r
𝐶𝑉 = 𝑉 𝐶 𝑉⊤. (2.116)\r
In the original (Majorana or real) basis 𝜉, however, the charge conjugation matrix\r
𝐶 is simply the identity matrix, so that:\r
𝜉\r
𝑐 = 𝜉 . (2.117)\r
We then apply the transformation law (2.116) for the charge conjugation matrix to\r
determine 𝐶𝑉 for 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉. This yields:\r
𝐶𝑉 = 𝑉 𝑉⊤ = 𝑒\r

which is consistent with the structure of the Majorana spinor under the new basis.\r
Notably, for any 𝜚 ∈ C satisfying 𝜚𝜚 = 1, the matrix 𝑈 = 𝜚𝑉 retains the same\r
intertwining properties as 𝑉 in Eqs. (2.107) and (2.108). Choosing 𝜚 = 𝑒\r

obtain:\r

More generally, the involutivity property (𝜓\r

𝑐 = 𝜓 implies that the charge conju\u0002gation matrix must satisfy 𝐶𝐶 = 1.\r

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact\r
Cartan Basis of 𝖘𝖚(2, 2) \u001B 𝖘𝖔(4, 2)\r
Outline of this section: Diagonalizing the complex structure generated by the volume\r
form 𝐸 = 𝑀(4, 2) (2.96) of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2), we split the spinor space 𝔖 (\u001B R\r
8\r
) into two\r
complex conjugate, chiral subspaces 𝔖+ and 𝔖−, each carrying a 4-dimensional\r
(complex) irreducible representation (IR) of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\r
⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
and thus also the corresponding IR of 𝔲(2, 2); see Remark\r
2.11 for this latter point, while a more systematic discussion of these representations\r
will be given in the next chapter. The resulting chiral basis of 8×8 complex matrices\r
— the complex counterpart of the 8 × 8 real matrices 𝑚0, 𝑚5, 𝑚1, . . . , 𝑚4, namely:\r
Γ0:= Γ𝚤, Γ5:= Γ𝚥, Γ1:= Γℓ𝚤 , Γ2:= Γ𝚥ℓ , Γ3:= 𝐿ℓ𝒌 , and Γ4:= Γℓ,\r
(2.124)\r
can be further restricted by diagonalizing a Cartan basis among the 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 2) generators:\r
Γ𝜇𝜈 :=\r

\u0002\r
Γ𝜇, Γ𝜈\r
\u0003\r
, (2.125)\r
where 𝜇, 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Eq. (2.60)-(2.62)). There are two types of such bases:\r
1. One, that belongs to the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔬(4)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔲(1) ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)\r
\u0001\r
of the maximal compact subgroup S\r
\r
U(2) × U(2)\r
\u0001\r
of SU(2, 2).\r
2. Another one that involves generators like Γ03 and Γ45 on noncompact boost\r
transformations.\r
Here, we shall restrict attention to the compact Cartan basis with generators Γ05,\r
Γ12, and Γ34 — the chiral counterpart of 𝑚05 (2.101), 𝑚12 (2.102), and 𝑚34 (2.103),\r
respectively.

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact Cartan Basis of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 432)\r
Let us begin by noting that the product of each pair of the real matrices 𝑚05, 𝑚12,\r
and 𝑚34 gives rise to the (Hermitian) volume forms of either 𝔠𝔩(2, 2) or 𝔠𝔩(4, 0).\r
These volume forms are diagonal and commute with each individual 𝐸𝐴𝐵 appearing\r
in (2.96) and (2.101)-(2.103). Indeed, we have:\r
𝑀12 (2, 2) 𝑥 =\r
\r
𝑚05 (𝑚12 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝚤\r

Ê(11𝒌 − 105 − 112 + 134) 𝑥 ,\r
(2.126)\r
𝑀34 (2, 2) 𝑥 =\r
\r
𝑚05 (𝑚34 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝚤\r
\u0010\r
𝚥\r
\r
ℓ𝒌(ℓ 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
=\r
Ê(11𝒌 − 105 + 112 − 134) 𝑥 ,\r
(2.127)\r
𝑀(4, 0) 𝑥 =\r
\r
𝑚12 (𝑚43 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= ℓ𝚤\u0010𝚥ℓ ℓ(ℓ𝒌 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
=\r
Ê(11𝒌 + 105 − 112 − 134) 𝑥 ,\r
(2.128)\r
where 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)) and the 1𝐴𝐵 represents the unit 2 × 2\r
matrices defined in Eq. (2.77). Again, for the convention É(. . . ), see Sect. 1.2.5.2.\r
The above results can be verified by substituting 𝑥 with any of the split-octonion\r
units (and in fact with all of them) and consulting the multiplication table (2.47).\r
Regarding the above construction, we observe that:\r
1. The following relation holds:\r
𝑀(4, 0) 𝑥 = 𝑀12 (2, 2)\r
\r
𝑀34 (2, 2) 𝑥\r
\u0001\r
. (2.129)\r
To verify this relation, it is sufficient — by Proposition 2.1 — to follow a\r
procedure analogous to that in Eq. (2.85).\r
2. The Lorentz 𝔠𝔩(3, 1) volume form is:\r
𝐸𝐿 𝑥 = 𝑀(3, 1) 𝑥 =\r
\r
𝑚03 (𝑚12 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝚤\r
\u0010\r
ℓ𝒌 ℓ𝚤( 𝚥ℓ 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
=\r
Ê(𝐸11 − 𝐸04 + 𝐸53 − 𝐸2𝒌 ) 𝑥 , (2.130)\r
where, once again, it can be verified by substituting 𝑥 with any of the split\u0002octonion units (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)) and consulting the multiplication table\r
(2.47). We observe that the aforementioned volume forms 𝑀12 (2, 2) and 𝑀(4, 0)\r
do not commute with the Lorentz one 𝑀(3, 1):\r
\u0002\r
𝑀12 (2, 2), 𝑀(3, 1)\r
\u0003\r
𝑥 ≠ 0 , and \u0002𝑀(4, 0), 𝑀(3, 1)\r
\u0003\r
𝑥 ≠ 0 . (2.131)\r
Once again, verification of these results reduces — by Proposition 2.1 — to\r
following a procedure analogous to that in Eq. (2.85).

442 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
Happily, there exists a third-order10 diagonal element 𝐷 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) that anti\u0002commutes with the Cartan elements 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34 of the maximal compact\r
Lie subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔬(4) ⊂ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), and consequently commutes with the\r
fourth-order diagonal volume forms given in Eq. (2.126)-(2.128):\r

𝑥 = 0 , (2.134)\r
where 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)), 𝐷𝐴𝐵 denotes the 2×2 matrices defined\r
in Eq. (2.78), while 1𝐴,𝐵,𝐶,𝐷 represents the 4 × 4 identity matrix corresponding\r
to its indices. To verify relation (2.132), one simply substitutes 𝑥 with any of the\r
split-octonion units (and in fact with all of them) and refers to the multiplication\r
table (2.47). The verification of the (anti)commutation relations, however, relies on\r
Proposition 2.1 and proceeds analogously to the method outlined in Eq. (2.85).\r
Remark 2.14 In connection with the above, we note that:\r
1. The representation of (2.132) as a sum of 2 × 2 diagonal matrices 𝐷𝐴𝐵 is not\r
unique. Actually, as a by-product of the discussion in Sect. 1.2.5.2 (in particular,\r
Eq. (1.6)), we may write, for instance:\r
Ê\r
𝐷1𝒌 − 𝐷05\u0001=\r
Ê\r
𝐷10 − 𝐷𝒌5\r
\u0001\r
, Ê\r
𝐷12 + 𝐷34\u0001\r
=\r
Ê\r
𝐷14 − 𝐷23\u0001\r
, etc. (2.135)\r
2. Besides the representation of (2.132), it is important to emphasize that the choice\r
of the third-order diagonal matrix 𝐷 = 𝑚5𝑚4𝑚2in (2.132) is not unique either.\r
This choice corresponds to triples of imaginary split-octonion units that gener\u000210 The Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(𝑙, 𝑟 ) admits a natural basis for its 2\r
𝑛=𝑙+𝑟\r
-dimensional vector space,\r
consisting of all possible products of its distinct anticommuting generators 𝑚1, . . . , 𝑚𝑛. These\r
basis elements can be systematically arranged according to the standard grading of the associated\r
Grassmann algebra Λ\r
⊗ = Λ0 ⊕ Λ1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Λ𝑛\r
, where each subspace Λ\r
𝑘\r
consists of all products\r
of exactly 𝑘 distinct generators 𝑚, while Λ\r
0\r
corresponds to the identity element 1 (i.e., no 𝑚-\r
generators at all). The dimension of Λ\r
𝑘\r
is given by the binomial coefficient \u0012\r
𝑛\r
𝑘\r
\u0013\r
, which counts the\r
number of ways to choose 𝑘 generators from 𝑛. We refer informally to elements of Λ\r
𝑘\r
as elements\r
of order 𝑘.

ate an associative subalgebra within the larger, nonassociative algebra of split\r
octonions. For a more detailed discussion, see Appendix 2.8. □\r
Remark 2.15 (necessity of the operator 𝐷 and resolution of the degeneracy)\r
Let 𝔖 \u001B R\r
8 be the spinor representation space of 𝔲(2, 2) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). We have\r
already introduced the four mutually commuting 8 × 8 skewsymmetric operators:\r
𝐸 (see Eq. (2.96)) , 𝑚05 (Eq. (2.101)) , 𝑚12 (Eq. (2.102)) , 𝑚34 (Eq. (2.103)) ,\r
(2.136)\r
where 𝐸 generates the 𝔲(1) center of 𝔲(2, 2), and 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34 form a trace\u0002orthogonal Cartan basis of the maximal compact subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔬(4) ⊂\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 2), such that:\r
1. Each operator can be expressed as a direct sum of four 2 × 2 skewsymmetric\r
blocks ±𝐸𝐴𝐵, with the same set of index pairs 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌, ℓ or\r
more conveniently 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)). That is:\r
𝐸 =\r
Ê\r
𝐴,𝐵\r
±𝐸𝐴𝐵 , 𝑚05 =\r
Ê\r
𝐴,𝐵\r
±𝐸𝐴𝐵 , . . . , (2.137)\r
where each block acts independently.\r
2. The joint eigenspace of a given quadruple of eigenvalues (𝜇𝐸, 𝜇05, 𝜇12, 𝜇34):\r
E(𝜇𝐸, 𝜇1, 𝜇2, 𝜇3) :=\r
n\r
𝑣 ∈ 𝔖 ; 𝐸𝑣 = 𝜇𝐸 𝑣 , 𝑚05𝑣 = 𝜇05𝑣 ,\r
𝑚12 𝑣 = 𝜇12𝑣 , 𝑚34𝑣 = 𝜇34𝑣\r
o\r
, (2.138)\r
is then 2-dimensional over R (see footnote 4). Indeed, each 2 × 2 block 𝐸𝐴𝐵\r
corresponds to exactly one eigenvalue quadruple and the 2-dimensionality arises\r
because each block is spanned by two independent vectors, for example:\r
𝑣1 =\r
\u0012\r
1\r
1\r
\u0013\r
, 𝑣2 =\r
\u0012\r
1\r
−1\r
\u0013\r
. (2.139)\r
However, there is no canonical way to distinguish these individual vectors (say 𝑣1\r
and 𝑣2) inside this joint eigenspace using 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34 alone, producing\r
an intrinsic twofold degeneracy.\r
To resolve this degeneracy, one requires an extra operator that acts within each\r
2-dimensional joint eigenspace and distinguishes the two vectors. This operator is\r
indeed the third-order Clifford element 𝐷 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) (see Eq. (2.132)), which satisfies\r
the anticommutation relations (2.133). Since 𝐷 anticommutes with 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and\r
𝑚34, its action on any vector 𝑣 in a joint eigenspace with eigenvalues 𝜇𝑋 satisfies:\r
𝑋(𝐷𝑣) = −𝐷(𝑋𝑣) = −𝜇𝑋(𝐷𝑣) , for 𝑋 = 𝐸 , 𝑚05 , 𝑚12 , 𝑚34 , (2.140)

462 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
where 𝜇𝑋 are the eigenvalues of 𝑣 under 𝑋. Since each joint eigenspace defines a\r
2-dimensional invariant plane under the action of 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, 𝑚34, flipping the signs\r
of all eigenvalues does not move a vector outside this plane. Consequently, 𝐷𝑣 lies\r
in the same 2-dimensional joint eigenspace as 𝑣, but is linearly independent of 𝑣; if\r
𝐷𝑣 were proportional to 𝑣, i.e., 𝐷𝑣 = 𝛼𝑣 for some nonzero scalar 𝛼, then acting with\r
any 𝑋 = 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, 𝑚34 would yield 𝜇𝑋 = −𝜇𝑋, forcing 𝜇𝑋 = 0, which does not\r
occur for the nontrivial 2×2 blocks under consideration. Therefore, 𝐷 automatically\r
generates a second independent vector in each joint eigenspace, completely resolving\r
the intrinsic twofold degeneracy. Concretely, 𝐷 acts like a Pauli-𝜎3 operator within\r
each 2 × 2 block, splitting the two states into eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues:\r

\u0013\r
= 𝑣1 . (2.142)\r
In addition, 𝐷 commutes (see Eq. (2.134)) with all fourth-order volume forms\r
𝑀12 (2, 2) (2.126), 𝑀34 (2, 2) (2.127), and 𝑀(4, 0) (2.128), ensuring that it preserves\r
the previously obtained block decomposition.\r
Accordingly, after including 𝐷, the extended set of (anti)commuting operators:\r
n\r
𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, 𝑚34, 𝐷o(2.143)\r
provides a complete, nondegenerate labeling of the spinor basis of 𝔖. □\r
Proposition 2.2 The operators 𝐸 (2.96), 𝐷 (2.132), and their product 𝑆 := 𝐷 𝐸\r
obey the same multiplication laws as their 2 × 2 matrix components (see Remark\r
2.5):\r
𝑆 = 𝐷 𝐸 = −𝐸 𝐷 =\r
Ê\r
𝑆1𝒌 − 𝑆05 − 𝑆12 − 𝑆34\u0001, (2.144)\r
𝐷 𝑆 = −𝑆 𝐷 = 𝐸 , and 𝐷\r
2 = 𝑆2 = 18 = −𝐸2\r
, (2.145)\r
generating a representation of the 𝔠𝔩(2) algebra. Here, 18 denotes the 8 × 8 identity\r
matrix. [We note that the labels of the indices of 𝐷 and 𝑆 will change in the chiral\r
basis.]\r
Proof Let us rewrite the above identities explicitly, one by one, by substituting the\r
operators 𝐸 (2.96) and 𝐷 (2.132) as they act from the left on 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs.\r
(2.60)-(2.62)):\r

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact Cartan Basis of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 472)\r
Applying Proposition 2.1 in the same way as Eq. (2.85), and consulting with the\r
miltiplication table (2.47), we find:\r
𝑆 𝑥 = 𝐷 (𝐸 𝑥) = −𝑚0\r
\r
𝑚1(𝑚3𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= −𝚤\r
\r
ℓ𝚤(ℓ𝒌 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
=\r
Ê(𝑆1𝒌 − 𝑆05 − 𝑆12 − 𝑆34) 𝑥 . (2.147)\r
For the convention É(. . . ), see Sect. 1.2.5.2. Following a similar procedure, we\r
obtain:\r
𝑆 𝑥 = −𝐸 (𝐷 𝑥) = −𝑚0\r
\r
𝑚1(𝑚3𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= −𝚤\r
\r
ℓ𝚤(ℓ𝒌 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
=\r
Ê(𝑆1𝒌 − 𝑆05 − 𝑆12 − 𝑆34) 𝑥 . (2.148)\r
Therefore, Eq. (2.144) follows.\r
2. Proceeding analogously, we find 𝐷 𝑆 = −𝑆 𝐷 = 𝐸; in particular:\r
𝐷(𝑆 𝑥) = −𝑚5\r
 \r
𝑚4\r
\u0012\r
𝑚2\r

3. Lastly, by a similar argument, the second identity in Eq. (2.145) follows trivially:\r
𝐷(𝐷 𝑥) = 𝑆(𝑆 𝑥) = 18 = −𝐸(𝐸 𝑥) . (2.151)\r
□\r
We now have all the ingredients to define the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) analogue of the similarity\r
transformation (2.108) (or, more generally, (2.119)) corresponding to the 𝔠𝔩(2) case,\r
which simultaneously diagonalizes the 𝔲(1) generator 𝐸 (2.96) of the conformal\r
Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1) and the trace-orthogonal Cartan elements\r
𝑚05 (2.101), 𝑚12 (2.102), and 𝑚34 (2.103) of the maximal compact subalgebra\r
𝔰𝔬(2) ⊕ 𝔰𝔬(4) ⊂ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). The corresponding unitary transformation 𝑈\r
explicitly reads as:

where, by construction, we have:\r
𝑈𝑈∗ = 𝑈\r
∗𝑈 = 18 = 𝑉∗𝑉 = 𝑉𝑉∗\r
. (2.153)\r
Note that the phase factor is chosen as 𝜚 = 𝑒\r
i𝜋/4\r
so that the corresponding charge\u0002conjugation matrix 𝐶 is real; this point will be clarified later.\r
To achieve our goal of simultaneous diagonalization of the aforementioned oper\u0002ators, there are two (semi)equivalent approaches:\r
1. First, we transform the operators and let the conjugated versions 𝑈𝐸𝑈−1,\r
𝑈𝑚05𝑈\r
−1\r
, . . . act on the original Majorana (real) basis 𝐴 = 1, 𝒌, 𝜈 ∈\r

𝚤, 5 := 𝚥, 1 := ℓ𝚤, 2 := 𝚥ℓ, 3 := ℓ𝒌 , 4 := ℓ\r
\t\r
.\r
2. Second, we leave the operators in their original form but instead transform the\r
basis, working with 𝑈\r
−1𝐴, i.e., the chiral basis.\r
The two procedures are equivalent in the sense that the resulting matrix realizations\r
are similar; however, the meaning of the indices differs in each case. In what follows,\r
we present both approaches explicitly, beginning with the first.\r
2.4.1 Operator Transformation in the Majorana Basis\r
Under the linear operator 𝑈, the volume form 𝑀(4, 2) = 𝐸 (2.96) transforms as:\r
𝜔(4, 2) = 𝑈 𝑀(4, 2) 𝑈\r

To obtain the above result, we consider the left multiplication on the split-octonion\r
units and invoke Proposition 2.2. Under the action of 𝜔(4, 2) on the split-octonion\r
units — namely, on the Majorana basis — the operator assumes the diagonal matrix\r
form (up to a factor of ‘i’) given in Eq. (2.132):\r

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact Cartan Basis of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 492)\r
where 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)). For the convention É(. . . ), refer to\r
Sect. 1.2.5.2.\r
We observe that the operator 𝐷 (2.132) commutes with the factors 𝑚𝜇′ , for\r
𝜇\r
′ = 5, 4, 2, while it anticommutes with the remaining factors 𝑚𝜈\r
′ , for 𝜈\r
′ = 0, 1, 3.\r
By contrast, the operator 𝐸 anticommutes with all 𝑚𝜈, for 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. These\r
properties can once again be readily justified by substituting the operators as they act\r
from the left on 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴} (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62)), and then invoking Proposition\r
2.1 together with an argument analogous to that in Eq. (2.85); see also the proof\r
of Proposition 2.2. With these observations in hand and using Proposition 2.2, we\r

Using Eqs. (2.158) and (2.148), together with Proposition 2.1 and the multipli\u0002cation table (2.47) — in a manner analogous to the proof of Proposition 2.2 —\r
one verifies that the transformed versions of the skew-symmetric Cartan matrices\r

To drive the above results, it suffices to substitute 𝑈 = 𝑒\r

Eqs. (2.152), (2.144), (2.132), and (2.96). For the complex rescaling of 𝑛\r
05b ±\r
, 𝑛\r
12b ±\r

and 𝑛\r
34b ±\r
by ‘i’, see Remark 2.16.\r
The above transformed basis spans the chiral space 𝔖, which, by construction,\r
decomposes into two complex-conjugate semispinor chiral subspaces 𝔖±:\r

Notably, each chiral subspace is totally isotropic; that is, for all 𝑛𝑎±, 𝑛𝑏±\r
∈ 𝔖±, the\r
bilinear form defined in (2.3) satisfies:\r

, 𝑛𝑏+\r
\u000B\r

\r
𝑛𝑎−, 𝑛𝑏−\r
\u000B\r

so that every vector has zero norm and all vectors within the same subspace are mu\u0002tually orthogonal. It is important to emphasize that this property holds independently\r
for 𝔖+ and 𝔖−, while in general the bilinear form between vectors from different\r
subspaces does not need to vanish. Actually, explicit calculations show that:11\r
11 Note that the star ‘∗\r
’ on 𝑛𝑎 denotes octonionic conjugation, which reverses the sign of the\r
imaginary units of OS but leaves the complex scalar i ∈ C unchanged. Accordingly, the resulting\r
norm differs from that with respect to which the similarity transformation 𝑈 is unitary.

, and 𝑛\r
34b ±\r
by the factor ‘i’ is prescribed\r
in such a way as to ensure the validity of the identities (2.180)-(2.183). This rescaling\r
corresponds to a rotation in the complex plane and leaves the underlying geometric\r
structure invariant. □

542 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
Taking the above into account, we now examine the matrix realization of the 𝔲(1)\r
generator 𝐸 (2.96) of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕𝔲(1), expressed\r
with respect to the chiral basis. This yields a form analogous to 𝜔(4, 2) (2.155), but\r
with a different interpretation of the indices:\r

(2.184)\r
where 𝑦 ∈ Span{𝑛𝑎±}. For the convention É(. . . ), see Sect. 1.2.5.2. This result\r
can be easily checked by substituting 𝑦 with any of the zero-norm basis vectors 𝑛𝑎±\r
(in fact, by substituting each one individually). Just to clarify the point, let us set\r
𝑦 = 𝑛\r
05b +\r
. Then, employing Eqs. (2.166), (2.154), and (2.155), we obtain:\r
𝐸 𝑛\r

\r
𝑛\r

\u0001\r
, (2.185)\r
which is consistent with Eq. (2.184). In this context, one observes that the chiral\r
(isotropic) subspaces 𝔖± (2.169) are precisely the eigenspaces of 𝜔(4, 2) (2.184)\r
corresponding to the eigenvalues ±i, respectively. That is:\r
𝜔(4, 2) 𝔖± = ±i 𝔖± . (2.186)\r
Similarly, one verifies that the skewsymmetric Cartan matrices 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34\r
(see Eqs. (2.101)-(2.103)) in their original forms assume the following diagonal\r
representations in the chiral basis, analogous to those in Eqs. (2.160)-(2.162), but\r

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact Cartan Basis of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 552)\r
where 𝑦 ∈ Span{𝑛𝑎±} and see Sect. 1.2.5.2 for the convention on É(. . . ). These\r
relations can be readily verified by following the same procedure outlined above (see\r
Eq. (2.185)).\r
With the above in mind, and analogously to the 𝔠𝔩(2) case (see Sect. 2.3.1), the\r
following relations hold for the chiral spinor 𝜓:\r
𝜓 =\r
\u0012\r
𝜓\r

(𝜓\r
𝑐\r
)\r
𝑐 = 𝜓 =⇒ 𝐶 𝐶 = 1 ; 𝐶 = 𝑈𝑈⊤\r
, (𝐶Majorana = 1) . (2.191)\r
Finally, repeating the analysis for 𝔠𝔩(2) leading to (2.120), we find the phase\r
factor 𝜚 relating 𝑈 and 𝑉 in (2.152) can be again fixed in a way to make the charge\r
conjugation matrix 𝐶 real. Specifically, one obtains:\r
𝐶𝑉 = 𝑉𝑉⊤ = 𝑒\r

4 𝐸 = −i𝐷𝐸 = −i𝑆 . (2.192)\r
Note that 𝐷\r
⊤ = 𝐷 and 𝐸⊤ = −𝐸. For 𝜚 = 𝑒i𝜋/4\r
(that is, 𝑈 = 𝑒\r
i𝜋/4𝑉), this relation\r
yields:\r
𝐶𝑈 = 𝐶𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈⊤ = 𝑆 . (2.193)\r

2.5 Appendix: A Mnemonic Matrix Rule for (Split) Octonionic\r
Multiplication\r
This appendix develops a mnemonic matrix formulation following the methodology\r
recently outlined in Ref. [101]. We consider a (split) octonion expressed in Cayley\u0002Dickson form:\r
𝑜 = 𝑞 + ℓ𝑝 , 𝑞, 𝑝 ∈ H , (ℓ)\r
2 = ±1 . (2.199)\r
The multiplication of two (split) octonions is given by Eq. (2.35); for convenience,\r
we reproduce it here:\r
\r
𝑞1 + ℓ𝑝1\r
\u0001 𝑞2 + ℓ𝑝2\u0001\r
= 𝑞1𝑞2 + (ℓ)\r

\r

To each octonion, we associate the matrix:\r
𝑀(𝑜) =\r
 \r
𝑞 (ℓ)\r

𝑝 𝑞∗\r

. (2.201)\r
A direct computation yields:\r

this matrix product reproduces the octonionic multiplication once these reversed\r

(or Eq. (2.35)).

×U(1) in the Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Action on \r
Inspection of Eq. (2.202) reveals a clear mnemonic pattern: in each block of the\r
matrix product, the terms naturally split into two contributions — one involving the\r
quaternionic product in standard (right) order, denoted 𝑅, and one in reversed (left)\r
order, denoted 𝐿. This separation provides a convenient guide for reconstructing the\r
octonionic multiplication from the matrix representation:\r
upper row ; 𝑅 + 𝐿 and 𝐿 + 𝑅 , (2.203)\r
lower row ; 𝐿 + 𝑅 and 𝑅 + 𝐿 . (2.204)\r
Equivalently:\r
left column ; 𝑅 + 𝐿 and 𝐿 + 𝑅 , (2.205)\r
right column ; 𝐿 + 𝑅 and 𝑅 + 𝐿 . (2.206)\r
In this way, the octonion multiplication table manifests as a highly structured block\r
arrangement of quaternionic products, with only half of the terms appearing in\r
reversed order. The matrix representation 𝑀(𝑜) thus provides a compact and practical\r
mnemonic for the non-associative octonionic product, offering a clear framework\r
for navigating the inherent non-associativity.\r

\r
\u001B SO(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
× U(1) in the Clifford\r
Algebra 𝖈𝖑(4, 2) and its Action on Spinors\r
Using the Clifford-algebraic framework developed in this chapter, the unitary\u0002conformal group U(2, 2) — equivalently SU(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B SO(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
× U(1) — ad\u0002mits a concrete realization in the real Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2), specifically within\r
its even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2). In this realization, the bivectors of the even subal\u0002gebra generate the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), while the Clifford\r
pseudoscalar (volume element) provides the 1-dimensional central 𝔲(1) component,\r
so that 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1). This unified Clifford-algebraic\r
setting naturally produces both the conformal Lorentz group SO(4, 2) and its spin\r
representation SU(2, 2) directly from the Clifford algebra’s multiplicative structure,\r
with the central U(1) factor realized as internal phase rotations generated by the\r
pseudoscalar. In this way, the full U(2, 2) group emerges naturally from the Clifford\u0002algebraic framework. We clarify this construction here.\r
To clarify the underlying structure, we present a step-by-step derivation leading\r
to the explicit construction. The even Clifford subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) is given by:\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) = Spann1 , 𝑚𝜇𝜈 := 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈 , 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈 𝑚𝜚 𝑚𝜎 , 𝐸 := 𝑚0 𝑚5 𝑚1 𝑚2 𝑚3 𝑚4\r
; 0 ≤ 𝜇 < 𝜈 < 𝜚 < 𝜎 ≤ 5\r

0 := 𝚤, 5 := 𝚥, 1 := ℓ𝚤, 2 := 𝚥ℓ, 3 := ℓ𝒌, 4 := ℓ\r
\t\r
, as defined\r
in Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62), and they satisfy the Clifford anticommutation relations\r
(2.64).\r
2. The Lie algebra generated by the 15 bivectors 𝑚𝜇𝜈 :=\r
1\r
2\r
\u0002\r
𝑚𝜇, 𝑚𝜈\r
\u0003\r
= 𝑚𝜇𝑚𝜈\r
coincides with the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) (see Eq. (2.85)).\r
We therefore identify the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) as embedded in the\r
even Clifford subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) via:\r
𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ↩→ Span\b𝑚𝜇𝜈 \t⊂ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) . (2.208)\r
Each 𝑚𝜇𝜈 acts on the real 8-dimensional spinor space 𝔖 = Span{𝐴} through\r
left multiplication (see Eqs. (2.60)-(2.62) and Remark 2.4).\r
3. The Clifford pseudoscalar (volume form) 𝐸 := 𝑚0 𝑚5𝑚1 𝑚2 𝑚3 𝑚4com\u0002mutes with every bivector 𝑚𝜇𝜈 (see Eq. (2.95)) and therefore generates the\r
1-dimensional center of the algebra, corresponding to the 𝔲(1) factor in 𝔲(2, 2).\r
Then, combining this central element with the conformal sector generated by\r
𝑚𝜇𝜈, one obtains the full Lie algebra:\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) . (2.209)\r
Any element of the group U(2, 2) can be expressed naturally by exponentiating a\r
linear combination of the bivectors 𝑚𝜇𝜈 and the pseudoscalar 𝐸:\r
12\r
U(2, 2) ∋ 𝑅˜(𝑋, 𝜔0 𝐸) = 𝑒\r

𝜇<𝜈 𝜔𝜇𝜈 𝑚𝜇𝜈, while 𝜔𝜇𝜈, 𝜔0 ∈ R. Since 𝐸\r
commutes with all 𝑚𝜇𝜈, this expression factorizes:13\r

thereby realizing the direct product structure U(2, 2) \u001B SU(2, 2) × U(1).\r
In this regard, it is important to emphasize that:\r
1. Expanding the exponential as a power series yields:\r
12 Note that the factor ‘ 1\r
2\r
’ ensures the correct spinorial form of conformal transformations. In\r
Clifford algebra, bivectors generate rotations and boosts with twice the physical angle when acting\r
on vectors; including ‘ 1\r
2\r
’ adjusts this so that 𝑒\r
1\r
2\r
𝑋\r
gives the proper single-angle rotation on spinors,\r
as required by the double-cover relation Spin(4, 2) \u001B SU(2, 2).\r

Each term in this series is a product of an even number of Clifford generators and\r
therefore belongs to the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2). Moreover, since 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2)\r
is finite-dimensional, the series converges within this subalgebra, ensuring that the\r
exponential (the group element) remains entirely inside 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2). Specifically:\r
a. From Proposition 2.1 and of course Remark 2.4, we recall that all powers\r
(𝐸)\r
𝑛 = (𝐿−𝒌 )𝑛\r
are well-defined and unambiguous. Exploiting this fact to\u0002gether with the identity 𝐸\r
2 = −1 (see Eq. (2.99)), the exponential of the\r
central element can be computed explicitly:\r

so that 𝜔0 plays the role of the internal U(1) phase angle.\r
b. Similarly, invoking Proposition 2.1 and Remark 2.4, all powers of the form\r
\r
𝑚𝜇𝑚𝜈\r
\u0001𝑛\r
are well-defined and unambiguous. Exploiting this property, to\u0002gether with the fact that each bivector 𝑚𝜇𝜈 = 𝑚𝜇𝑚𝜈\r
squares to:14\r
\r
𝑚𝜇𝜈 \u00012= −𝜂𝜇𝜇 𝜂𝜈𝜈 1 = ±1 , (2.214)\r

,\r
(2.215)\r
with each term lying in the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2).\r
2. The inverse of any group element follows directly from the exponential structure:\r

3. Because the even subalgebra is closed under multiplication, the product of any\r
two such elements again yields an element of the same form:\r

0\r
) = 𝑅˜(𝑋\r
′′, 𝜔′′\r

) ∈ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) . (2.217)\r
Accordingly, the exponential construction realizes U(2, 2) entirely within 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2).\r
14 This identity can be verified by a procedure analogous to that used in Eq. (2.91).

4. Finally, the associativity required for the group law is ensured by the associativity\r
of operator composition, which holds by construction as explained in Remark\r
2.4.\r
Remark 2.17 For a more tangible visualization of the SU(2, 2) group structure, we\r

Each 𝔲(2) factor admits the decomposition:\r
𝔲(2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2) ⊕ 𝔲(1) . (2.220)\r
Let 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 and 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 denote the special unitary parts of the left and right 𝔲(2)\r
factors, respectively, in (2.219). The two corresponding 𝔲(1) generators, denoted 𝑍𝐿\r
and 𝑍𝑅, represent the scalar (central) components of the two 𝔲(2) summands.\r
The tracelessness condition Tr(𝑋) + Tr(𝑌) = 0 implies that 𝑍𝐿 and 𝑍𝑅 are not\r
independent, but satisfy the linear constraint:\r
𝑍𝐿 + 𝑍𝑅 = 0 . (2.221)\r
As a consequence, the center of the maximal compact subalgebra is 1-dimensional\r
and generated by the single 𝔲(1) element\r
𝑍 := 𝑍𝐿 − 𝑍𝑅 . (2.222)\r
Accordingly, the maximal compact subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) reads as:

where the quotient by Z2 is generated by the element (−12, −1), which acts trivially\r
on all representations and enforces the determinant constraint globally.\r
Substituting this decomposition into the product U(2)𝐿 × U(2)𝑅, the defining\r
unimodularity condition det(𝑔𝐿) det(𝑔𝑅) = 1 relates the two central U(1) phases\r
via:\r
𝑒\r
i( 𝜃𝐿+𝜃𝑅 ) = 1 , (2.227)\r
where 𝑒\r
i𝜃𝐿 and 𝑒i𝜃𝑅 denote the phase rotations associated with U(1)𝐿 and U(1)𝑅,\r

U(1) phases, leaving a single residual U(1) generated by the relative phase 𝑒\r

Proof For any split octonion 𝑥 and 𝜇, 𝜈, 𝜆 satisfying (2.229), we have the following\r

since (𝜇 𝜈 𝜆) 𝑥 = 1𝑥 by Eq. (2.229)\r

This proves the proposition (=⇒) and also tells us that the diagonal elements of\r
the matrix 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈 𝑚𝜆are 1, up to a sign. The inverse statement (⇐=) of the above,\r

Ladder Representation of 𝖚(2, 2) as a Quantized\r
4-dimensional Realization\r
Abstract This chapter develops a rigorous framework for positive-energy ladder\r
representations of the conformal Lie algebra:\r

⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) ,\r
realized as quantized models of massless fields with arbitrary helicity in 4-\r
dimensional Minkowski, de Sitter (dS), and anti-dS spacetimes. The construction is\r
founded on an invariant bilinear form in the Majorana-spinor space of𝔠𝔩(4, 2), estab\u0002lishing the geometric basis for the representation theory. Through the isomorphism\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1)\r
\r
⊃ 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\u0001\r
, an explicit 4 × 4 matrix realization is intro\u0002duced, encoding conformal symmetry in a computationally tractable spinorial form.\r
This provides the foundation for the systematic construction of ladder operators,\r
spectral analysis, and conformally covariant field operators.\r
The representations appear as lowest-weight modules characterized by conformal\r
energy and helicity, giving a full classification of massless conformal fields under\r
𝔲(2, 2). In particular, restriction to the dS subalgebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) — a central\r
focus of this study — preserves irreducibility, thereby capturing the notion of mass\u0002lessness in this curved background. Embedding these modules into 4-dimensional\r
conformal vertex algebras reveals their analytic structure, including operator product\r
expansions and modular properties. The Casimir invariants are explicitly computed,\r
clarifying their role in the spectrum, while the correspondence between 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and\r
its Euclidean form 𝔰𝔬(5, 1) completes a unified algebraic framework for the study of\r
massless conformal systems in both flat and curved settings.\r

space of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) spinors, spanned by the split-octonion units, naturally carries the\r
structure of a composition algebra — nonassociative but alternative. In particular,\r
it can be equipped with a real-valued trace, a Cayley-Dickson conjugation, a factor\u0002izable quadratic norm 𝑁(𝜉), and an associated nondegenerate symmetric bilinear\r

. This construction yields two\r
inequivalent 8-dimensional spinor representations of Spin(4, 4), arising from left\r
and right multiplication by split-octonion units, together with a third 8-dimensional\r
vector representation. The three are tied together by an invariant trilinear (“Yukawa”)\r
form, which manifests the triality symmetry of the Lie algebra 𝐷4 (see Refs. [102,\r
103], for more details).\r
We now reproduce the inner product (3.2) in the chiral (complex) basis of the\r
generators Γ𝜈 of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The basis generators satisfy the anticommutation relations:\r
\b\r
Γ𝜇, Γ𝜈\r
\t\r
= 2𝜂𝜇𝜈 , (3.3)\r
which follow directly from Eq. (2.64). Their behaviour under Hermitian conjugation\r
is given by:\r

. With the above in mind, let us first determine\r
a unitary element 𝐵 of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) satisfying:

Recall that 𝜔(4, 2) is the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) volume form in the basis \bΓ𝜈\r
\t\r
(see Eq. (2.163)),\r
while the bivector generators Γ𝜇𝜈 are defined in Eq. (2.125).\r
Remark 3.1 In the chiral basis of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2), the Clifford generators Γ𝜈are not all anti\u0002Hermitian with respect to ordinary Hermitian conjugation (see Eq. (3.4)); this reflects\r
the mixed Hermiticity properties induced by the Clifford relations in signature (4, 2).\r
As a result, the standard inner product fails to be compatible with the requirement\r
that the generators Γ𝜇𝜈 of the conformal algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) act as anti-Hermitian\r
operators.1Indeed, with respect to the standard inner product:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝜙⟩\r
std = 𝜓\r
∗\r
𝜙 , (3.6)\r
one finds:\r
⟨𝜓, Γ𝜇𝜈𝜙⟩\r
std = 𝜓\r

𝜙 = ⟨Γ\r
∗\r
𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩\r
std = ⟨±Γ𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩std , (3.7)\r
where the sign depends on the specific bivector generator Γ𝜇𝜈 under consideration.\r
Thus, the generators Γ𝜇𝜈 are not uniformly anti-Hermitian with respect to (3.6),\r
obstructing the construction of a unitary representation in the chiral basis.2\r
To remedy this, one introduces a unitary element 𝐵 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and defines a\r
modified notion of adjoint by imposing Γ\r
∗\r
𝜈 𝐵 = −𝐵 Γ𝜈\r
, and hence Γ\r
∗\r
𝜇𝜈 𝐵 = −𝐵 Γ𝜇𝜈\r
(see Eq. (3.5)). This condition allows one to define a new inner product:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝜙⟩𝐵 = 𝜓\r
∗𝐵 𝜙 , (3.8)\r
1 Let (H , ⟨·, ·⟩ ) be a complex inner product space and let 𝑋 be a linear operator on H . The\r
adjoint 𝑋\r
† of 𝑋 (with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩) is defined by the relation:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝑋𝜙⟩ = ⟨𝑋\r
†𝜓, 𝜙⟩ , for all 𝜓, 𝜙 ∈ H .\r
The operator 𝑋 is said to be Hermitian if 𝑋\r
† = 𝑋 and anti-Hermitian if 𝑋† = −𝑋. These notions\r
depend explicitly on the chosen inner product. In particular, when the inner product is modified, the\r
corresponding adjoint changes accordingly. Only in the special case of the standard inner product\r
does the adjoint 𝑋\r
†\r
coincide with ordinary Hermitian conjugation 𝑋\r
∗\r

⊤\r
.\r
2 For a unitary representation on a Hilbert space, it is necessary that the generators 𝑋 of the Lie\r
algebra be anti-Hermitian with respect to the chosen inner product, ensuring that their exponentials\r
𝑒\r
𝛼𝑋 (𝛼 ∈ R) are unitary operators and hence that the group representation is unitary.

𝐵 𝜙 = ⟨−Γ𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩𝐵,\r
(3.9)\r
showing explicitly that Γ𝜇𝜈 is anti-Hermitian with respect to (3.8). Consequently,\r
the associated one-parameter subgroups of the conformal group are represented by\r
unitary operators on the Hilbert space, guaranteeing the unitarity of the representa\u0002tion.\r
Finally, requiring that 𝐵 commute with the Clifford volume form 𝜔(4, 2) ensures\r
that the inner product respects the chirality decomposition of the spinor space. In\r
particular, left- and right-handed sectors remain orthogonal, and the action of the\r
bivector generators Γ𝜇𝜈 preserves each chiral sector. In this way, the element 𝐵\r
provides a canonical and algebraically consistent framework for realizing unitary\r
positive-energy irreducible representations (UPEIRs) of the conformal algebra in\r
the chiral Clifford basis.\r
Note: For the sake of notational simplicity, we shall henceforth drop the subscripts\r
‘std’ and ‘𝐵’ from the inner product, as the relevant choice will always be clear from\r
the context. □\r
Remarkably, there exists such a Hermitian unitary 𝐵 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) determined by\r
the above properties up to sign. It turns out that the resulting 𝐵 coincides with the\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 0) pseudo scalar:\r
𝐵 = 𝑀(4, 0) = 𝑚12𝑚43 = 𝑈 𝑚12𝑚43 𝑈\r

since [𝑚12𝑚43 , 𝑈] = 0\r

−1 = Γ12Γ43 .\r
(3.10)\r
The commutation relation \u0002𝑚12𝑚43, 𝑈\u0003= 0 can be verified straightforwardly by\r
substituting the explicit form of the unitary transformation 𝑈 from Eq. (2.152),\r
making use of Eqs. (2.96), (2.132), and (2.148), and referring to Proposition 2.1.\r
Then, the Hermitian unitary operator 𝐵 admits a diagonal form both in the Majorana\r

It looks natural to view the de Sitter (dS) Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) as a Clifford\r
subalgebra of the conformal one 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). It turns out, however, to be advantageous\r
to use the known isomorphism between the even part of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2), denoted here by\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2), and the irreducible realization C[4] of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1). Specifically, we identify\r
the 4 × 4-matrix realization of the generators 𝛾𝛼(𝛼 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) with\r
the projected “boosts” Γ𝛼5of the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2):\r

𝔖 = Span\b𝐴 : 𝐴 = 1, 𝒌, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4\r

.\r
(3.21)\r
Moreover, for the definitions of 𝐷 in the chiral (complex) and Majorana (real) bases,\r
respectively, see Eqs. (2.184) and (2.132).\r
Remark 3.2 Some remarks on the map Γ𝛼5↦−→ 𝛾𝛼(3.17) are as follows:\r
1. The above realization of the generators 𝛾𝛼 of the dS Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) \u001B\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) follows from the identities:\r
\b\r
Γ𝛼5, Γ𝛽5\r
\t\r
=\r
\b\r
Γ𝛼, Γ𝛽\r
\t\r
= 2𝜂𝛼𝛽 , and \u0002Γ𝛼5, Γ𝛽5\r
\u0003\r
=\r
\u0002\r
Γ𝛼, Γ𝛽\r
\u0003\r
, (3.22)\r
where 𝜂𝛼𝛽 = diag(−, +, +, +, +), with 𝛼, 𝛽 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. These relations show\r
that the matrix Γ5drops out of both the anticommutation and commutation rela\u0002tions among the projected generators Γ𝛼5\r
. Consequently the projected “boosts”\r
Γ𝛼5obey the same Clifford 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) and Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) relations as the\r
Γ𝛼. Hence, one can consistently regard Γ𝛼5as an 8 × 8-matrix representation of\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 1), and define the 4 × 4 matrices 𝛾𝑖:= Γ𝑖5𝐷+ and 𝛾\r
0\r
:= Γ05𝐷+, which pro\u0002vide a 4 × 4-matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) (and therefore of the corresponding\r
Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1)).\r
2. Obviously, the map Γ𝛼5↦−→ 𝛾𝛼(3.17) does not respect the Z2 grading of\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) is naturally Z2-graded, meaning it has an\r
even and odd part:\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) = 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) ⊕ 𝔠𝔩odd (4, 2) . (3.23)\r
By definition, the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) consists of elements that can be\r
expressed as products of an even number of generators Γ𝜈, while the odd subspace

3.2 Isomorphism of𝔠𝔩(4, 1) with the Even Part of𝔠𝔩(4, 2): 4×4 Matrix Realization of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 692)\r
𝔠𝔩odd (4, 2) consists of elements formed from an odd number of generators. The\r
mapping in question explicitly interchanges even and odd elements, sending even\r
elements of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) to odd elements of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) and vice versa. As a result, it fails\r
to preserve the Z2 grading.\r
3. As a benefit of this 4 × 4 matrix realization of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) \u001B 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2), the 𝔠𝔩(4, 1)\r
is found to have the constant value ‘i’, which corresponds to the eigenvalue of\r
𝜔(4, 2) on the chiral subspace 𝔖+:\r
4\r
w(4, 1) 𝑦 := 𝛾05 𝛾15 𝛾25 𝛾35 𝛾45 𝑦\r
= Γ05 Γ15 Γ25 Γ35 Γ45 𝐷+ 𝑦\r
= Γ05 Γ12 Γ34 𝐷+ 𝑦\r
=𝜔(4, 2) 𝐷+ 𝑦\r
= i1𝐷+ 𝑦 , (3.24)\r
where 𝑦 ∈ Span{𝑛𝑎±\r
} and 1 is the unit operator in the totally isotropic space 𝔖+\r
spanned by the null vectors 𝑛\r
1c𝒌+\r
, 𝑛\r
05b +\r
, 𝑛\r
12b +\r
, 𝑛\r
34b +\r
.\r
The significance of this result, and in particular the sense in which it constitutes a\r
genuine benefit of the present realization, merits a brief clarification. In general,\r
the Clifford pseudoscalar of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) is central but need not act as a fixed scalar\r
on a spinor module, and its value typically depends on representation-dependent\r
conventions. In the present realization, however, w(4, 1) is identified with the\r
conformal volume element 𝜔(4, 2) restricted to the chiral subspace 𝔖+; since\r
𝜔(4, 2) is a Casimir invariant of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), its action is fixed, yielding w(4, 1) = i1.\r
Thus, the 4 × 4 representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) is automatically irreducible, and its\r
complex structure is canonically inherited from conformal chirality rather than\r
imposed by hand. □\r
We proceed to displaying the 4 × 4-matrix realization of the relevant physical\r
operators of 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) ⊃ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) ⊃ 𝔰𝔬(4, 1). To begin with, the 4-dimensional\r
projection of the Hermitian form 𝐵 (see Eq. (3.11) and (3.12)) is:\r

An intermediate step toward this construction was given in Ref. [106], where the Lie\r
algebra 𝔲(2, 2) was embedded in 𝔠𝔩(4, 1).\r
The idea is to view the components of the conformal chiral semispinors 𝜓\r

denoted here by 𝜑 and its Dirac conjugate 𝜑e= 𝜑\r
∗B, as bosonic creation and annihi\u0002lation operators.5 More precisely, we postulate that 𝜑 ∈ 𝔖+ and 𝜑e ∈ 𝔖− satisfy the\r
canonical commutation relations:\r

Remark 3.4 The bilinear operators 𝐽𝜇𝜈 introduced in Eq. (3.34) furnish an explicit\r

It is important to note that the Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2)\r

a central 𝔲(1) generator, which commutes with all elements of the algebra. In the setting involving\r
the “second-quantized” ladder operators, we denote this central element by C1. A more detailed\r
discussion of this point will be given later; see Eq. (3.64) and the subsequent discussion.

where, again, 𝜂𝜇𝜈 is the mostly ‘+’ metric tensor in R\r
4,2\r
. Note that to derive the\r
identity above, we make use of the following formula:\r
[𝐴𝐵, 𝐶𝐷] = 𝐴[𝐵, 𝐶]𝐷 + [𝐴, 𝐶]𝐵𝐷 + 𝐶 𝐴[𝐵, 𝐷] + 𝐶[𝐴, 𝐷]𝐵 . (3.38)\r
2. Chirality preservation: The full set {𝛾𝜇𝜈 } preserves chirality, since each 𝛾𝜇𝜈\r
commutes with the “chirality matrix” 𝜔(4, 2), that is \u0002𝛾𝜇𝜈, 𝜔(4, 2)\r
\u0003\r
= 0 (see also\r
Eqs. (2.186) and (2.190)). Specifically, we have:\r
𝜔(4, 2)\r
\r
𝛾𝜇𝜈𝜑\r
\u0001\r
= 𝛾𝜇𝜈 𝜔(4, 2)𝜑\r
\u0001\r

𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 \u0001𝜔(4, 2) =\r

𝜑 𝜔e (4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
𝛾𝜇𝜈 = −i\r
\r
𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 \u0001, (3.40)\r
meaning that each chiral subspace 𝔖+\r
\r
= Span{𝜑}\r
\u0001\r
or 𝔖−\r
\r
= Span{𝜑e}\r
\u0001\r
is invariant under the action of 𝛾𝜇𝜈. Therefore, the bilinear operators 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑) are well-defined on each chiral subspace, in the sense that 𝛾𝜇𝜈 does not\r
mix the chiralities, yielding a closed representation of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) on each subspace.\r
3. Faithfulness of the chiral spinor representation: The chiral spinor representation\r
of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), obtained by restricting the action of the matrices 𝛾𝜇𝜈 to either 𝔖+\r
or 𝔖− is not only closed under commutation but also faithful. This can be seen\r
from the following observations:\r
a. Each chiral spinor subspace 𝔖± is a 4-dimensional complex vector space.\r
Therefore, the algebra of all linear operators on it, End(𝔖±), is isomorphic to\r
Mat(4, C) and has complex dimension 16.

\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) Describing Massless Particles of Any Helici\r
b. The 15 antisymmetric matrices 𝛾𝜇𝜈, obtained by restricting to a fixed chi\u0002ral subspace, are linearly independent and satisfy the 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) Lie algebra\r
commutation relations.\r
Therefore, the image of the representation of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) on either 𝔖+ or 𝔖− is a\r
15-dimensional subalgebra of End(𝔖±). Since the kernel of the map is trivial,\r
the representation is injective, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between\r
the elements of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and their images in End(𝔖±), and thus confirming the\r
faithfulness of the representation.\r
Note: This key fact will be illustrated explicitly in the realization presented in\r
Eqs. (3.99)-(3.114).\r
Note: If the chiral spinor representation on either 𝔖+ or 𝔖− were not faithful, then\r
distinct elements of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) could act identically on the corresponding subspace.\r
In that case, the bilinears 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑) would generate only a smaller algebra\r
— either the quotient of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) by the kernel of the representation, or, in certain\r
realizations, a proper subalgebra corresponding to a restricted set of generators.\r
In other words, part of the Lie algebra would be “invisible” to the spinors, and the\r
representation would effectively “forget” that portion of the algebraic structure.\r
□\r
From now on, we focus on a series of the U(2, 2) representations characterized by\r
a lowest weight state, treated as a “Fock vacuum” |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ that transforms as a singlet7\r
under the maximal compact subgroup S\r
\r
U(2) ×U(2)\r
\u0001\r
\u001B SO(4) ×U(1) of SU(2, 2),\r
more specifically under the SO(4) factor, and such that the conformal Hamiltonian\r
𝐻\r

(i.e., the U(1) generator of the subgroup) is bounded from below:\r
𝐻 := i𝐽05 =\r

⩾ 1 , and (𝐻 − 1) |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ = 0 . (3.41)\r
The identification of |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ with a “Fock vacuum” presupposes singling out the\r
creation and annihilation:\r
P+ 𝜑 |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ = 0 = 𝜑eP− |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ , where P± =\r
1 ± B\r
2\r
. (3.42)\r
Note: A second series of U(2, 2) representations arises, corresponding to highest\u0002weight ladder representations, in which the conformal Hamiltonian is negative def\u0002inite. This situation occurs when the roles of the projectors P+ and P− are inter\u0002changed. However, this case will not be considered in the present work.\r
To make the subsequent discussion more transparent, we shall display a realization\r
of the 4 × 4 matrices 𝛾𝑖(with 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4) in accord with the construction (3.17). It\r
follows from Eqs. (2.190), (2.192), and (2.148) that:\r
7\r
In physics and mathematics — especially in group theory, quantum mechanics, and representation\r
theory — a singlet means a state or object that transforms trivially under the action of a group.\r
8\r
Its significance was recognized early on by Irving Segal (1918-1998) albiet in a rather speculative\r
context [107].

, (3.43)\r
for 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. On the other hand, from Eq. (2.156) and (2.157), we have,\r
respectively:\r
Γ𝜇′ = 𝑚𝜇′ 𝐸 , for 𝜇\r
′ = 5, 4, 2 ,\r
Γ𝜈\r
′ = i𝑚𝜈′ 𝐷 , for 𝜈\r
′ = 0, 1, 3 . (3.44)\r
By Proposition 2.2 and in fact its natural extension, we obtain:\r
Γ𝜇′ 𝐶 = 𝐶 Γ𝜇′ =⇒ Γ\r
𝜇′ = Γ𝜇′ , for 𝜇\r
′ = 5, 4, 2 ,\r
Γ𝜈\r
′ 𝐶 = −𝐶 Γ𝜈′ =⇒ Γ𝜈\r
′ = −Γ𝜈\r

′ = 0, 1, 3 . (3.45)\r
These results imply that the 8 × 8 matrices Γ2, Γ4, and Γ5are real, whereas Γ0, Γ1,\r
and Γ3are purely imaginary. Correspondingly, we find:\r

overall sign flip compared to the standard quaternion multiplication rules; this re\u0002versal, highlighted below using quotation marks (‘−’). This subtle modification leads\r
to the following algebraic relations:\r

2 = (E3\r

2 = −E4\r
,\r
E1E2 = −E2E1 = ‘−’E3,\r

4 = E4\r
. (3.50)\r
Correspondingly, the 8 × 8 Γ-matrices are set to be:\r
Γ0 = 𝜎1 ⊗ 𝛾\r
0\r
,\r
Γ5 = 𝜖\r
∗ ⊗ 14 , 𝜖 = i𝜎2\r

\u0012\r
0 −1\r
1 0 \u0013\r
,\r
Γ𝑖 = 𝜎1 ⊗ 𝛾𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4 . (3.51)\r
Here, and before proceeding any further, it is perhaps worth noting that the above\r
realization of E1, . . . , E4 as the “opposite” or “conjugate-quaternionic” structure is\r
not unique. For example, one may equally identify them with the quaternion basis\r
elements 𝚤, − 𝚥, 𝒌, 1, respectively.\r
Proof (consistency check). The consistency of the above setup is ensured by the\r
fact that all algebraic relations within each realization — namely, among the 𝛾 and\r
among the Γ matrices — are explicitly satisfied. For example:\r
1. Recalling that the basis used in the matrix representations (3.47) and (3.48) is\r
ordered as 𝑛\r
1c𝒌+\r
, 𝑛\r
05b +\r
, 𝑛\r
12b +\r
, 𝑛\r
34b +\r
, one readily verifies that the matrix realization of\r
𝛾05 in (3.47) precisely coincides with that given in (3.27).\r
2. The matrix representations given in (3.47) and (3.48) for 𝛾0:= −𝛾05 and 𝛾𝑖:= 𝛾𝑖5\r
(𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4) satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 2) — more specifically, those of the subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) ⊂ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2); for\r
instance, we have:\r
\u0002\r
𝛾15, 𝛾25\u0003= 2\r
\u0012\r
E3 0\r
0 E3\r

\u0012\r
E3 0\r
0 −E3\r
\u0013\r
= 2𝛾34 , (see Eq. (3.29)) . (3.53)\r
3. In view of the above, one can further verify that:

= i14 , (3.54)\r
or similarly considering the realization given in (3.51):\r
𝜔(4, 2) = Γ0Γ5Γ1. . . Γ4 = i𝜎3 ⊗ 14 = i𝐷 , (𝐷 = 𝜎3 ⊗ 14) , (3.55)\r
which is compatible with (3.24).\r
4. The Γ-matrices (3.51) satisfy the anticommutation relations of the Clifford algebra\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2), namely:\r
\b\r
Γ𝜇, Γ𝜈\r
\t\r
= 2𝜂𝜇𝜈1 , (3.56)\r
where, as before, the indices run over 𝜇, 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the metric is\r
𝜂𝜇𝜈 = diag(−1, −1, +1, +1, +1, +1).\r
5. Lastly, with the above setup, one verifies that:\r
𝛾𝑖5 = Γ𝑖5𝐷+ = Γ𝑖Γ5𝐷+ = 𝛾𝑖, and 𝛾05 = Γ05𝐷+ = Γ0Γ5𝐷+ = 𝛾\r

For an irreducible representation (IR) of U(2, 2), the Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B\r
𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) includes, in addition to the conformal generators\r
𝐽𝜇𝜈 ∈ 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), a central 𝔲(1) generator which commutes with all ele\u0002ments of the algebra. We denote this central element by C1, which takes the explicit\r
form:10\r
C1 = 𝜑 𝜑e = 𝔞∗𝔞 − 𝔟 𝔟∗ = 𝔞∗𝔞 − (𝔟\r
∗\r
𝔟 + 2) . (3.64)\r
Following steps analogous to those used in deriving Eq. (3.37), one readily verifies\r
that:\r
\u0002\r
𝐽𝜇𝜈, C1\r
\u0003\r
= 0 , (3.65)\r
for all 𝜇, 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4. It is important to emphasize that the “second-quantized”\r
ladder operator C1 (which belongs to 𝔲(2, 2) but not to 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)) serves as the\r
representative of the pseudoscalar (volume form) of 𝐸 = 𝑀(4, 2), as defined in Eq.\r
(2.96), within this framework.\r
The normal ordering in (3.64) ensures that C1 is a Hermitian operator with a\r
well-defined spectrum. Since the bosonic operators 𝑁𝔞 := 𝔞∗𝔞 and 𝑁𝔟 := 𝔟∗𝔟, which\r
act on the Fock space, are number operators with non-negative integer eigenvalues,\r
their difference has integer eigenvalues in the Fock space realization. Thus, we can\r
write:\r
𝔞\r

𝔞 − 𝔟\r

𝔟 =: 2𝜆 , with 𝜆 ∈\r

Substituting into Eq. (3.64), we obtain:\r
C1 = 𝜑 𝜑e = 𝔞∗𝔞 − 𝔟 𝔟∗ = 𝔞∗𝔞 − 𝔟\r
∗\r
𝔟 − 2 =: 2(𝜆 − 1) ∈ Z . (3.67)\r
Notably, this quantized parameter 𝜆 plays a fundamental role in classifying the\r
UPEIRs of 𝔲(2, 2), and will later be identified as the “hilicity” — the conformal\r
analog of helicity — characterizing massless conformal particles in 4 dimensions\r
[13].\r

78 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
Remark 3.5 The fact that C1 assumes a fixed integer value in any IR of 𝔲(2, 2)\r
reflects a deeper principle rooted in the representation theory of Lie groups, as\r
outlined in the following steps:\r
1. The generator C1 lies in the center of 𝔲(2, 2), as it commutes with all elements\r
of the algebra.\r
2. By Schur’s lemma, in any IR of 𝔲(2, 2), such a central operator must act as a\r
scalar multiple of the identity.\r
3. Therefore, in an IR of 𝔲(2, 2), all states are eigenstates of C1 with a fixed eigen\u0002value.\r
4. To ensure that this representation lifts to a single-valued representation 𝑈 of the\r
Lie group U(2, 2) (and not just of its algebra), the exponential of the central\r
generator must be well-defined and single-valued:11\r
𝑈(𝜃) = 𝑒\r
i𝜃 C1\r
, with 𝑈(𝜃 + 2𝜋) = 𝑈(𝜃) . (3.68)\r
This periodicity condition requires:\r
𝑒\r
2i𝜋C1 = 1 =⇒ C1 ∈ Z . (3.69)\r
Hence, in any IR of 𝔲(2, 2), the eigenvalue of the central generator C1 must be\r
an integer. □\r
Proposition 3.2 The higher-order Casimir invariants of the ladder-type UPEIRs of\r
𝔰𝔲(2, 2) are polynomial functions of the parameter 𝜆, which labels the eigenvalue of\r
the central 𝔲(1) generator C1 of 𝔲(2, 2). It turns out that this is also true for the dS\r
subalgebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) ⊂ 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). In fact, invariants of 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) and 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) are both\r
integer multiplies of:\r

This proposition reflects a general feature of IRs, where Casimir operators act as\r
scalars determined by the representation labels. As already pointed out, physically,\r
𝜆 plays the role of a helicity-like quantum number, so these Casimir eigenvalues\r
encode invariant properties of massless conformal fields classified by helicity 𝜆.\r
Proof — Step I (proof of Eq. (3.72)). Starting with Eq. (3.72), we observe that the\r
proof rests on the following essential tensor identity:\r

where A and B are constants to be determined and 𝛾𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
\u0002\r
𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜈\r
\u0003\r
. Let us first\r
justify the validity of this ansatz.\r
In even-dimensional spaces of dimension d (as in our case, d = 6), the Dirac\r
spinor representation has dimension 𝑁 = 2\r
d/2\r
, so the space of all 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrices\r
acting on spinors has dimension 𝑁\r
2 = 2d\r
. The corresponding Clifford algebra\r
provides a natural basis for this matrix space. Strictly speaking, it consists of the\r
antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices:\r
n\r
1, 𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜇𝜈, 𝛾𝜇𝜈𝜌, . . . , 𝛾𝜇1...𝜇d\r
o\r
, (3.74)\r
which are linearly independent and span the entire space of operators on spinor space;\r
one observes that the number of independent elements in this set is Íd\r
𝑘=0\r
\r
d\r
𝑘\r
\u0001\r
= 2\r
d =\r
𝑁\r
2\r
, exactly matching the dimension of the matrix space. Consequently, any matrix\r
𝑀 acting on spinors can be expressed as a linear combination of the corresponding\r
Clifford basis elements:\r
𝑀 = 𝑎 1 + 𝑏\r
𝜇\r
𝛾𝜇 + 𝑐\r
𝜇𝜈𝛾𝜇𝜈 + . . . , (3.75)\r
for some coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏𝜇, 𝑐𝜇𝜈, · · · ∈ C.\r
With these observations in mind, let us now return to the expression:\r
(𝛾𝜇𝜈)\r
𝑎\r
𝑏\r
(𝛾\r
𝜇𝜈)𝑐\r
𝑑\r
, (3.76)\r
which, by the preceding discussion, must be expressible as a linear combination of\r
the basis elements of the corresponding Clifford algebra, that is, 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). Because\r
the Lorentz indices 𝜇, 𝜈 are fully contracted, the resulting object must be a Lorentz\r
scalar. This rules out any terms involving uncontracted gamma matrices such as 𝛾𝜇,\r
𝛾𝜇𝜈𝜌, etc., which would transform as Lorentz tensors and hence violate the scalar\r
nature of the left-hand side. On the other hand, the spinor-index structure of the\r
right-hand side must also be built from Lorentz-invariant tensors in spinor space. In\r
the absence of additional invariant structures (e.g., a charge-conjugation matrix 𝐶 or\r
chirality projectors; as in our setup12), the only such invariant tensors are Kronecker\r
deltas:\r
𝛿\r
𝑎\r
𝑏\r
, 𝛿𝑐\r
𝑑\r

𝑑\r
, 𝛿𝑐\r
𝑏\r

12 Recall that we work with IRs of the conformal algebra realized on the chiral subspace 𝔖+.

𝑎\r
𝑏\r

are linearly independent and span\r
the space of Lorentz-invariant rank-(2, 2) spinor tensors.\r
Finally, note that the left-hand side is symmetric under the simultaneous exchange\r
(𝑎 ↔ 𝑐, 𝑏 ↔ 𝑑). This symmetry must be preserved by the right-hand side. Indeed,\r
both 𝛿\r

This confirms that no additional index structures are needed, and the ansatz used in\r
the expansion (3.73) is the most general form consistent with Lorentz invariance and\r
spinor symmetry.\r
With the expansion (3.73) established, we now aim to determine the constants A\r
and B. To this end, we make use of standard trace identities of the Clifford algebra in\r
d dimensions (applicable to both odd and even d; here d = 6). The general identity\r
in d dimensions, for spinors of dimension 𝑁 (here 𝑁 = 4\r
13), reads:\r
Tr𝛾𝜇𝜈𝛾\r
𝜇𝜈 \u0001\r
= 𝑁\r
d(d − 1)\r
2\r
, with 𝜇 < 𝜈 , (3.80)\r
where for 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), with d = 6 and 𝑁 = 4, is:\r
Tr𝛾𝜇𝜈𝛾\r
𝜇𝜈 \u0001\r
= 4\r
6 × 5\r
2\r
= 60 , with 0 ≤ 𝜇 < 𝜈 ≤ 5 . (3.81)\r
Keeping this in mind, let us proceed by taking two traces of (3.73):\r
1. Contract 𝑎 = 𝑑, 𝑏 = 𝑐:\r
60 = 16A + 4B . (3.82)\r
2. Contract 𝑎 = 𝑏, 𝑐 = 𝑑:\r
0 = 4A + 16B , (3.83)\r
since Tr𝛾𝜇𝜈 \u0001= Tr\r
1\r
2\r
[𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜈]\r
\u0001\r
= 0 (see Eqs. (2.11) and (2.13)).\r
Accordingly, we obtain A = 4 and B = −1, and hence:\r
(𝛾𝜇𝜈)\r
𝑎\r

𝑑 = 4 𝛿\r

Equipped with the above expansion, together with Eqs. (3.33) and (3.34), we are\r
now in a position to establish Eq. (3.72) rigorously:\r
13 Since we focus exclusively on the IR of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) realized on the chiral subspace 𝔖+.

— Step II (proof of Eq. (3.71)). Here, we turn our attention to the second identity\r
stated in the proposition, namely Eq. (3.71). To begin, and in analogy with expression\r
(3.34), we express 𝐽𝛼𝛽 in terms of spinor bilinears as:\r
𝐽𝛼𝛽 =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
𝜑 𝛾 e 𝛼𝛽 𝜑\r
\u0001\r

1\r
2\r
\u0002\r
𝛾𝛼, 𝛾𝛽\r
\u0003\r
. (3.86)\r
Under this identification, the generators 𝐽𝛼𝛽 form a closed and complete set for the\r
Lie algebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1), as can be demonstrated using arguments analogous\r
to those in Remark 3.4.\r
It is important to emphasize that in odd-dimensional spaces of dimension d (for\r
example, d = 5, relevant for the dS case), the Clifford algebra, just as in the even\u0002dimensional case discussed earlier, provides a complete basis for 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrices\r
acting on spinor space, where 𝑁 = 2\r
⌊d/2⌋\r
. This basis consists of the antisymmetrized\r
products of gamma matrices (see Eq. (3.74)). Consequently, any spinor-valued matrix\r
can be expanded in terms of this basis. However, unlike in even dimensions, there\r
is no chirality operator in odd dimensions, so the corresponding representation is\r
irreducible by construction.\r
Following the same reasoning as in the previous step, we perform the expansion:\r

Remark 3.6 It is worth noting that the dS (quadratic) Casimir C\r
𝔰𝔭(2,2)\r

= −2(𝜆\r
2 −1)\r
(3.71), derived within a rigorous Clifford-algebraic framework, provides a clear ex\u0002planation of the observation made by Barut and Böhm in 1970 [40] using a conven\u0002tional group-theoretic analysis of the conformal group. Restricting the ladder-type\r
UPEIRs of the conformal algebra to the dS subalgebra, the Casimir invariant (3.71)\r
coincides exactly with the quadratic Casimir eigenvalues of the dS group associ\u0002ated with the so-called massless representations (see Eq. (1.20)). By adopting the\r
conformal Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) as the primary algebraic framework, this formu\u0002lation not only reproduces these results but also provides a geometrically enriched,\r
unified treatment of algebraic, spinorial, and conformal structures, facilitating the\r
construction and analysis of massless ladder representations and their restriction to\r
dS symmetry. This picture will be clarified further in the sequel. □

84 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
We now revisit the “second-quantized” ladder generators of the 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) Lie\r
algebra, defined by 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑) (3.34), by providing an explicit and consistent\r
matrix realization of these generators. To this end, we employ Eq. (3.36), along with\r
the matrix representation of the 𝛾-matrices given in Proposition 3.1. Our analysis\r
begins with the elements of the (diagonal) Cartan subalgebra:\r

Remark 3.9 Before proceeding, let us clarify in what sense the operators 𝐸𝑎 and 𝐹𝑎\r
are called raising and lowering operators for representations of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). Let |W⟩ be\r
a weight vector defined by:\r
𝐻𝑎 |W⟩ = W𝑎 |W⟩ , (3.132)\r
with weight components W = (W1, W2, W3) corresponding to the Cartan genera\u0002tors 𝐻1, 𝐻2, and 𝐻3; since the Cartan elements commute, they are simultaneously\r
diagonalizable, and thus admit a common eigenbasis. Consider the action of 𝐹𝑏 on\r
|W⟩. Using the commutation relation [𝐻𝑎, 𝐹𝑏] = −𝐴𝑎𝑏𝐹𝑏, we find:\r
𝐻𝑎\r
\r
𝐹𝑏 |W⟩\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
[𝐻𝑎, 𝐹𝑏] + 𝐹𝑏𝐻𝑎\r
\u0001\r
|W⟩ (3.133)\r
=\r
\r

\u0001\r
|W⟩ (3.134)\r
=\r
\r
W𝑎 − 𝐴𝑎𝑏\u0001𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ . (3.135)\r
This shows that 𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ is again a weight vector, whose weight component is shifted\r
as:\r
W𝑎 ↦−→ W𝑎 − 𝐴𝑎𝑏 . (3.136)\r
Equivalently, the total weight vector transforms as:\r
𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ ↦−→\r
\f\r
\fW − 𝛼𝑏\r
\u000B\r
, (3.137)\r
where the simple root 𝛼𝑏 is given by the 𝑏-th column of the Cartan matrix 𝐴𝑎𝑏;\r
explicitly, 𝛼1 = (2, −1, 0)\r
⊤, 𝛼2 = (−1, 2, −1)⊤, and 𝛼3 = (0, −1, 2)⊤.\r
Similarly, the operator 𝐸𝑏 acts as a raising operator, shifting the weight vector\r
upward by the corresponding simple root:\r
𝐸𝑏 |W⟩ ∝\r
\f\r
\fW + 𝛼𝑏\r
\u000B\r
, (3.138)\r
where 𝛼𝑏 is the simple root associated with 𝐸𝑏. □\r
Given the above, we define the lowest weight state |LW𝜆⟩ of the UPEIR of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
(with a given helicity 𝜆) as:\r
|LW𝜆⟩\r

This state is annihilated by all lowering operators 𝐹𝑎 (see Eqs. (3.61) and (3.62)):\r
𝐹𝑎 |LW𝜆⟩ = 0 , for 𝑎 = 1, 2, 3 . (3.140)

90 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
Moreover, |LW𝜆⟩ is an eigenstate of the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 (3.130) (see also\r
(3.63)) with eigenvalue:\r
E◦ := 1 + |𝜆| , with 𝜆 ∈\r
1\r

so that:\r
(𝐻 − E◦)|LW𝜆⟩ = 0 . (3.142)\r

serves to label the lowest weight state |LW𝜆⟩ of the representation.14\r
Remark 3.10 One verifies that the lowest weight state (3.139) transforms in the\r
spin-𝑠 = 𝜆 representation of 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 and is a singlet under 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 for positive\r

𝜆 with a hierarchical\r
structure, since the action of the raising operators 𝐸𝑎 increases the eigenvalue of the\r

with E◦ = 1 + |𝜆| as the lowest value. This construction furnishes a transparent\r

shows that every UPEIR of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) — in particular the one-particle Hilbert space\r
H\r

characterized by the lowest eigenvalue E◦ of the conformal Hamiltonian (up to the\r
sign of the helicity parameter 𝜆), just as its lowest weight state |LW𝜆⟩ is. This point\r
is discussed further in Remark 3.12.\r
Remark 3.11 It is important to emphasize that each eigenspace H\r
(1)\r
E\r
\r
⊂ H\r
(1)\r
𝜆\r
\u0001\r
is not invariant under the full conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2); rather, it is invariant\r
under the subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4). This is because the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 generates\r
the 𝔲(1) center of the maximal compact subalgebra 𝔰\r
\r
𝔲(2) ⊕ 𝔲(2)\r
\u0001\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4) ⊕ 𝔲(1),\r
and therefore commutes with the 𝔰𝔬(4) generators but not with the entire algebra\r
𝔰𝔲(2, 2). Consequently, the action of 𝔰𝔬(4) preserves each eigenspace H\r
(1)\r
E\r
of\r
𝐻; strictly speaking, each H\r
(1)\r
E\r
carries a (generally reducible) finite-dimensional\r
representation of 𝔰𝔬(4). Proposition 3.4, and in particular the third step of its proof,\r
provides a more detailed analysis of this structure. □\r
Accordingly, a discrete, compact basis can be constructed for the Hilbert space\r

eigenstates of the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 (3.130) and of the Casimir operator\r

are labeled by three (half-)integers: E , which labels the 𝔰𝔬(4)-\r

j𝐿, j𝑅 ∈\r

Z≥0 ≤ E − 1\r
o\r
. (3.151)\r
In this context, by construction, the 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) UPEIR space is fully generated by\r
repeated action of the raising operators 𝐸𝑎 on the lowest weight state:\r
|LW𝜆⟩ = |E◦, j𝐿, j𝑅⟩ , (3.152)\r
which has lowest conformal energy E◦ = 1 + |𝜆|, and is accordingly denoted by:\r
H\r
(1)\r
𝜆\r
=: C\r
>\r
E◦,j𝐿 ,j𝑅\r
. (3.153)\r
Note that the superscript ‘>’ indicates that the representations C\r
>\r
E◦,j𝐿 ,j𝑅\r
are charac\u0002terized by the positivity of the conformal energy, meaning that the spectrum of 𝐻 is\r
bounded from below (see Eq. (3.41)).\r
Although this point has already been noted, it is appropriate to scrutinize, within\r
the above labelling, that the lowest weight state |E◦, j𝐿, j𝑅⟩, which furnishes the\r
full Hilbert space H\r
(1)\r
𝜆\r
, is itself uniquely specified by its conformal energy E◦, up\r
to the sign of the helicity parameter 𝜆. In particular, for a given E◦ (and hence a\r
fixed |𝜆|), there exist two distinct configurations of (j𝐿, j𝑅), each corresponding to\r
one of the two possible helicity signs, which give rise to two inequivalent realiza\u0002tions of the corresponding UPEIR, distinguished as positive- and negative-helicity\r
representations.\r
To render this dependence explicit, we impose relation (3.148) on the lowest\r
weight state |E◦, j𝐿, j𝑅⟩, yielding:\r
j𝐿 (j𝐿 + 1) + j𝑅(j𝑅 + 1) = |𝜆| (|𝜆| + 1) . (3.154)\r
For a given E◦ (and hence a fixed |𝜆|), this equation — consistent with Remark 3.10\r
— admits only two possible choices for the lowest weight state |E◦, j𝐿, j𝑅⟩:

\f\r
\f\r
|𝜆| + 1, 0, |𝜆|\r
\u000B\r
, (3.156)\r
where:\r
1. The first choice (3.155) specifies the positive helicity UPEIR of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) and is\r
denoted by:\r
C\r
>\r
|𝜆|+1,|𝜆|,0\r
=: C\r
>\r
𝑠+1,𝑠,0\r
, with |𝜆| =: 𝑠 . (3.157)\r
The positivity of the helicity follows from the fact that the lowest weight state\r
|𝑠+1, 𝑠, 0⟩ in this representation transforms in the spin-𝑠 representation of 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿\r
and is a singlet under 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 (see Remark 3.10).\r
2. The second choice (3.155), however, specifies the 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) UPEIR with negative\r
helicity, in which the lowest weight state is annihilated by the same lowering op\u0002erators, but with the roles of SU(2)𝐿 and SU(2)𝑅 exchanged. This representation\r
is usually denoted as:\r
C\r
>\r
|𝜆|+1,0,|𝜆|\r
=: C\r
>\r
𝑠+1,0,𝑠 , with |𝜆| =: 𝑠 . (3.158)\r
The negative helicity arises from the fact that the lowest weight state |𝑠 + 1, 0, 𝑠⟩\r
in this representation transforms in the spin-𝑠 representation of 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 and is a\r
singlet under 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 (see, again, Remark 3.10).\r
Thus, for each fixed lowest conformal energy E◦, and hence for fixed |𝜆| = 𝑠, there\r
is a unique positive-helicity 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) UPEIR C\r
>\r
𝑠+1,0,𝑠\r
and a corresponding negative\u0002helicity UPEIR C\r

, related by exchanging the 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 and 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 roles in the\r
lowest weight state.\r
With this labelling, in the zero-helicity (𝜆 = 0) case, the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ is identified with |1, 0, 0⟩. It is perhaps worthwhile noting that\r
the zero-helicity space H\r
(1)\r
𝜆=0 — corresponding to the representation at the very\r
bottom of the ladder representations, with j𝐿 = j𝑅 = 0 and 𝜆 = 0 — coincides with\r
the state space of the non-relativistic, regularized hydrogen atom. This connection\r
was first uncovered in the 1960s through the study of spectrum-generating algebras.\r
Note: For a detailed account of how the conformal massless (ladder) UPEIR\r
restricts to the dS case, see Appendix 3.7. □\r
Remark 3.13 From the construction above, one immediately observes a key identity\r
that will prove useful in the sequel. Specifically, for any helicity parameter 𝜆 in the\r
lowest weight state, one has:\r
E◦ −\r
\r
j𝐿 + j𝑅\r
\u0001\r
= 1 . (3.159)\r
This relation naturally extends to all descendant states as:\r
E −\r
\r
j𝐿 + j𝑅\r
\u0001\r
∈ Z>0 . (3.160)

Indeed, all descendant states are obtained by repeated action of the raising operators\r
𝐸𝑎 on the lowest weight state, which increases the eigenvalue of the conformal\r
Hamiltonian 𝐻 in discrete steps. Moreover, such actions leave the integer or half\u0002integer nature of j𝐿 + j𝑅 invariant. This latter observation can be viewed as a\r
by-product of the discussion in Appendix 3.7, in particular Eq. (3.292). □\r
Remark 3.14 In this setting, the corresponding ladder representations of the ex\u0002tended conformal algebra 𝔲(2, 2) = 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1) are constructed as direct sums\r

The additional 𝔲(1) generator endows H (1) with a natural 𝔲(1)-grading by helicity\r
and coherently couples the graded sectors into a single IR of 𝔲(2, 2). States in the\r
𝔲(2, 2) 1-particle space H (1)are therefore labelled by the helicity 𝜆 together with\r
the usual energy and spin quantum numbers:\r

The momentum generator 𝑝𝜇¤(𝜇¤ = 0, 1, 2, 3) of the Poincaré subalgebra of 𝔲(2, 2)\r

. This is proven in Ref.\r
[13], using a realization of 𝛾 matrices with 𝛾4 — rather than B — diagonal. Here,\r
we instead adopt a complex-variable formulation of 4-dimensional conformal space,\r
providing a unified treatment of both dS and Minkowski cases.\r
Proposition 3.3 Let us introduce the complex translation operators 𝑇𝑖 and the spe\u0002cial conformal generators 𝐶𝑖\r

characterized by a vanishing four-square:\r

Proof — Step I (the role of 𝜖 = i𝜎2 as a spinor metric). In 2-component spinor\r
formalism, the antisymmetric tensor 𝜖𝐴𝐵 (𝜖𝐴𝐵 = −𝜖𝐵𝐴, with 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 2) — given\r
explicitly by:\r
𝜖𝐴𝐵 = i𝜎2 =\r

spinor indices:\r
𝜓𝐴 = 𝜖𝐴𝐵 𝜓\r
𝐵\r
, 𝜓𝐴 = 𝜖\r
𝐴𝐵 𝜓𝐵 . (3.168)\r
Thus, if 𝜓\r
𝐴 =\r
\u0012\r

\u0013\r
, then:\r

\u0013\r
. (3.169)\r
This structure is essential both algebraically and geometrically, for the following\r
reasons:\r
1. Antisymmetry and fermionic bilinears: The antisymmetry of𝜖𝐴𝐵 guarantees that\r
spinor contractions like 𝜓\r
𝐴𝜒𝐴 = 𝜓𝐴 𝜖𝐴𝐵 𝜒𝐵 are antisymmetric under exchange\r
𝜓\r
𝐴𝜒𝐴 = −𝜒𝐴𝜓𝐴. This antisymmetry is a necessary condition when dealing with\r
Grassmann-valued spinor fields (as in quantum field theory (QFT)), ensuring that\r
bilinear quantities obey the correct statistics for fermions.\r
2. Invariant tensor under SL(2, C): The matrix 𝜖𝐴𝐵 is, up to a nonzero scalar\r
multiple, the unique nondegenerate, antisymmetric rank-2 tensor invariant under\r
the action of SL(2, C) — the double cover of the proper, orthochronous Lorentz\r
group. It satisfies the identity:\r
(𝑆𝜖 𝑆⊺)𝐴𝐵 = 𝜖𝐴𝐵 , for all 𝑆 ∈ SL(2, C) , (3.170)\r
thereby ensuring that spinor index raising and lowering, as well as Lorentz\u0002invariant contractions, are preserved under transformations of the spinor repre\u0002sentation.

3. Why 𝜎1 and 𝜎3 fail: The other Pauli matrices, namely 𝜎1 =\r
\u0012\r
0 1\r
1 0\u0013\r
and\r
𝜎3 =\r
\u0012\r
1 0\r
0 −1\r
\u0013\r
are symmetric and do not yield antisymmetric spinor bilinears.\r
For instance:\r
𝜓\r
𝐴\r
(𝜎1)𝐴𝐵 𝜒\r
𝐵 = 𝜒𝐴\r
(𝜎1)𝐴𝐵𝜓\r
𝐵\r
, (3.171)\r
which is symmetric, violating the required antisymmetry for fermionic contrac\u0002tions. Moreover, these matrices are not invariant under SL(2, C) transformations\r
and hence do not define Lorentz-invariant inner products on spinor space.\r
— Step II ((E𝑖)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵\r
and (E𝑖)\r
𝐴𝐵). Recall that the Pauli matrices and 𝜎0 read as:\r
(𝜎1)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵 =\r
\u0012\r
0 1\r
1 0\u0013\r
, (𝜎2)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵 =\r
\u0012\r

𝐵 =\r

, (𝜎0)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵 =\r
\u0012\r
1 0\r
0 1\u0013\r
.\r
(3.172)\r
Then, the associated mixed-index tensors (“conjugate” quaternions) (E𝑖)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵\r
are:\r
(E𝑖)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵\r
:=\r
(\r
i(𝜎𝑖)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵\r
, for 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3 ,\r
(𝜎0)\r
𝐴\r
𝐵\r
, for 𝑖 = 4 .\r
(3.173)\r
Given the above, the bispinor tensors (E𝑖)\r
𝐴𝐵 are defined by:\r
(E𝑖)\r
𝐴𝐵 = 𝜖𝐴𝐶 (E𝑖)𝐵\r
𝐶\r
. (3.174)\r
— Step III (four essential expansions). As a by-product of the proof of Propo\u0002sition 3.2, we put forward the following essential identity:\r

where, again, A and B are constants to be determined. We take two traces of the\r
above expansion:\r
1. Contract 𝐴 = 𝐷, 𝐵 = 𝐶:\r
8 = 2A + 4B . (3.176)\r
2. Contract 𝐴 = 𝐵, 𝐶 = 𝐷:\r
4 = 4A + 2B . (3.177)\r
We obtain A = 0 and B = 2, and therefore the first expansion takes the form:\r

2. Contract 𝐴 = 𝐵, 𝐶 = 𝐷:\r

3.3 Positive Energy Ladder Representations of 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) Describing Massless Particles of Any Helici\r
In this representation of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), the generators 𝑇𝑖 and 𝐶𝑖 act by con\u0002struction as ladder operators, raising and lowering the eigenvalues of the conformal\r
Hamiltonian 𝐻, respectively. In particular, from the latter canonical commutation\r
relation, it follows that the lowering operators 𝐶𝑖 annihilate the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆⟩, which is an eigenstate of 𝐻 with eigenvalue E◦ := 1 + |𝜆| (see Eq. (3.142)):\r
𝐶𝑖|LW𝜆⟩ = 0 . (3.196)\r
The commutation relation (3.192) implies that the operators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗, which generate\r
the maximal compact subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅, leave invariant the\r
eigenspaces H\r
(1)\r
E\r
of the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻, as noted before. In a particularly\r
significant case, the operators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 act on the lowest weight state in the zero-helicity\r
(𝜆 = 0) case as follows:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ =: 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ = 0 . (3.197)\r
This condition explicitly demonstrates that the zero-helicity lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ transforms as a singlet under the maximal compact subgroup\r
SO(4), justifying its designation as a “Fock vacuum” with respect to this subgroup\r
(see Eq. (3.41) and the accompanying discussion). Of course, it should not be con\u0002fused with the unique conformally invariant zero-energy vacuum state |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩, which\r
is invariant under the full conformal group U(2, 2) and will be introduced later in\r
the context of the complete conformal field theory (CFT) construction.\r
Note that the identities stated in the above proposition can be proven either\r
within the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114) of the generators or in\u0002dependently, based on the intrinsic algebraic relations (3.37) among the 𝐽𝜇𝜈 entities\r
involved. For pedagogical clarity, we present below a proof that seeks to strike a\r
balance between these two approaches, highlighting in each case the method that\r
offers the more instructive perspective.\r
Proof — Step I (proof of the commutation relations (3.193)). The commutation\r
relations presented above can be readily derived from the known algebraic properties\r
(3.37) of the generators 𝐽𝜇𝜈. Nevertheless, it is instructive to verify them explicitly\r
within the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114) of the generators. As an\r
illustration, let us consider (3.193).\r
By employing Eq. (3.38) in combination with the previously established decom\u0002positions, we obtain the following commutation relations between the operators 𝐶𝑖\r
and 𝑇𝑗:

Proceeding analogously to the steps outlined above, with Eq. (3.38) in mind, the\r
remaining commutation relations (3.192), (3.194), and (3.195) follow directly within\r
the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114).\r
— Step II (proof of (3.196)). Using a procedure analogous to that described in\r
Remark 3.9, the proof of Eq. (3.196) follows directly from the commutation relation\r
(3.195). On the other hand, employing the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-\r
(3.114) of the generators, together with the definition (3.62), immediately leads to\r
Eq. (3.196).\r
— Step III (proof of (3.197)). Eq. (3.197) can be straightforwardly verified\r
through the (relevant) matrix realization (3.99)-(3.114), in conjunction with (3.62).\r
We, however, choose to present an alternative — and arguably more illustrative —\r
proof that relies purely on the algebraic relations intrinsic to the generators.\r
We begin with the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 and the angular momentum-like\r
generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗, which satisfy the commutation relation [𝐻, 𝐽𝑖 𝑗] = 0 (3.192). This\r
relation implies that each 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 preserves the eigenspaces H\r
(1)\r
E\r
⊂ H\r
(1)\r
𝜆\r
of 𝐻 (3.145);\r
that is:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 ; H\r
(1)\r
E\r
↦−→ H (1)\r
E\r
. (3.199)\r
In particular, this invariance extends to the zero-helicity, lowest-energy eigenspace\r
H\r
(1)\r
E◦\r
, which contains solely (up to an overall scalar factor) the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ =: |1, 0, 0⟩. As a matter of fact, as can be deduced from Eq.\r
(3.150) for j𝐿 = 0 = j𝑅, this eigenspace is 1-dimensional. It then naturally follows\r
that the action of 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 on this state must take the form:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ = 𝛼𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ , (3.200)\r
for some scalar coefficients 𝛼𝑖 𝑗 ∈ C.\r
The generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 span the compact subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅, and\r
therefore act as angular momentum operators. In any unitary representation, they\r
are represented by traceless anti-Hermitian matrices. On the 1-dimensional space\r
H\r
(1)\r
E◦\r
, the only possible linear operators are scalar multiples of the identity. Imposing

3.4 Complex Analytic Picture: Globally Conformal Invariant Vertex Algebra 101\r
tracelessness forces the scalar to vanish. Hence, the only consistent possibility is:\r
𝛼𝑖 𝑗 = 0 =⇒ 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ =: 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ = 0 , (3.201)\r
which shows that |LW𝜆=0⟩ =: 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ transforms trivially — i.e., as a singlet —\r
under the maximal compact subgroup generated by 𝐽𝑖 𝑗. □\r

these properties show that, locally, the complex coordinates 𝑧 describe the product\r

equivalent to the Minkowski metric in 𝑥-space, thereby establishing conformality in\r
the infinitesimal (local) sense. Hence, the map 𝑔𝑐 is locally conformal. On the other\r
hand, Eq. (3.214) demonstrates that causal structure and angular relationships are

preserved up to a position-dependent scale factor, confirming that 𝑔𝑐 is globally\r
conformal as well.\r
To give meaning to quantum fields depending on complex variables, we recall\r
some properties of the vector-valued distribution 𝜙ˆ(𝑥)|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ which follow from the\r
basic assumptions (Wightman assumptions) of relativistic QFT [110, 111].\r
Theorem 3.1 We recall:\r

U(2,2)\r
⟩,\r
where 𝜙ˆ is a relativistic quantum field and |0\r
U(2,2)\r

sense — of an analytic (ket-)vector-valued function defined in the forward tube\r

Note that 𝔗\r

+\r
is a precompact domain19 in 𝐸C. Furthermore, this transforma\u0002tion preserves the form of Eqs. (3.213) and (3.214) under analytic continuation.\r
18 It is important to clarify that throughout this work, we denote by |0U(2,2)\r
⟩ the unique vacuum\r
state of the theory. In the setting of CFT, this vacuum is invariant under the full conformal group\r
U(2, 2), and in particular under its Poincaré subgroup. In the broader context of QFT, |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩\r
refers to the Poincaré-invariant vacuum defined within the Wightman framework, characterized by\r
translation invariance and the spectral condition. In theories with exact conformal symmetry, these\r
two notions are compatible and in fact coincide. Accordingly, it is natural and consistent to use the\r
same notation for both.\r
19 The domain 𝔗\r
precompact\r
+\r
is, by construction, an open subset of C\r
4\r
. Since it is open, it is not closed,\r
and therefore not compact (in finite-dimensional spaces, compactness is equivalent to closedness\r
and boundedness). Nevertheless, 𝔗\r
precompact\r
+\r
is bounded, being entirely contained within the open\r
unit ball. Consequently, its closure lies inside the closed unit ball, which is compact. Thus, while\r
the set itself is not compact, its closure is compact, and the set is therefore referred to as precompact\r
(or relatively compact).

3. The tube domain 𝔗+ and its image 𝔗\r
precompact\r
+ are each invariant under real confor\u0002mal transformations20 [112]. The closure 𝑀compact of the precompact image of 𝑀\r
in 𝐸C has the form:\r

Note that 𝑧 remains invariant under the change of coordinates (𝑟, 𝜏) ↦−→ (−𝑟, 𝜏 +\r
𝜋).\r
Proof — Step I (the proof of 1). The proof of (1) relies on the spectrum condition\r
(energy positivity and Poincaré invariance) and standard properties of the Laplace\r
transform of tempered distributions [110, 111].\r
By the Wightman axioms, the state 𝜙ˆ(𝑥)|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ defines a vector-valued tempered\r
distribution onR\r
3,1\r
. In particular, its Fourier transform exists in the sense of tempered\r
distributions and has support contained in the closed forward light cone:\r

o\r
. (3.220)\r
This is the content of the spectrum condition, which follows from energy positivity\r
and Poincaré invariance.\r
We now apply the Laplace transform to this distribution. For any 𝑦 ∈ R\r
3,1\r
, with\r
𝑦\r
0 > |⃗𝑦| (where ⃗𝑦 = (𝑦1\r
, 𝑦2, 𝑦3) and |⃗𝑦| =\r

2 + (𝑦2\r

. Thus, 𝜙ˆ(𝑧)|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ defines a well-defined, an\u0002alytic vector-valued function in the forward tube 𝔗+.\r
On the other hand, by standard results on the Laplace transform of tempered\r
distributions with support in the forward light cone (see, e.g., [110, 111]), the\r
analytic function 𝜙ˆ(𝑧)|0\r
U(2,2)\r

U(2,2)\r

boundary value in the distributional sense as 𝑦 → 0 within 𝔗+. That is, for any\r

U(2,2)\r
⟩ arises as the boundary value of the analytic function\r
𝜙ˆ(𝑧)|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ from the forward tube 𝔗+. This completes the proof.\r
— Step II (the proof of 2). The proof of the second item follows from a direct\r
calculation [109, 113]. As an illustration, let us focus on the first part of the statement\r
— namely, the regularity of the conformal map:\r

on the forward tube 𝔗+ =\r
\b\r
𝑤 := 𝑥 + i𝑦 ; 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ R\r
3,1\r
, 𝑦0 > |⃗𝑦|\r
\t\r
. The map 𝑔𝑐 is\r
regular (holomorphic) on 𝔗+ provided that its denominator never vanishes there;\r
in other words, regularity of 𝑔𝑐 on the forward tube requires that Ω(𝑤) ≠ 0 for all\r
𝑤 ∈ 𝔗+.\r
Suppose, for contradiction, that Ω(𝑤) = 0 at some 𝑤 ∈ 𝔗+:\r
Ω(𝑤) =\r
1 + (𝑤)\r

compactified Minkowski space 𝑀compact.\r
22 The “conformal dimension” (also called “scaling dimension”) E of a field 𝜙(𝑥) is defined by its\r
transformation under dilations (scale transformations) of the spacetime coordinates:\r

Note that, in the last expression, the “prime” on the field is omitted by convention (𝜙\r
′\r
(𝑥\r

) ∼ 𝜙(𝑥\r
′\r
)),\r
and the field is understood to be the transformed one, identified by its transformed coordinate. This\r
transformation rule ensures that correlation functions and the action remain consistent with scale\r
invariance. For a free, massless scalar field in 4-dimensional spacetime, conformal invariance of\r
the kinetic term ∫𝑑\r
4𝑥 (𝜕𝜇¤ 𝜙ˆ)2 fixes E = 1; see also footnote 14. In our case, the field 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) :=\r
2𝜋\r
Ω(𝑧)\r
𝜙ˆ\r
\r
𝑔𝑐 (𝑧)\r
\u0001\r
is defined as a conformally rescaled version of the free scalar field 𝜙ˆ(𝑥), where\r
𝑥 = 𝑔𝑐 (𝑧) is a conformal map from the compactified coordinates 𝑧 to Minkowski coordinates 𝑥.\r
The factor 1\r
Ω(𝑧)\r
ensures that 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) transforms as a primary scalar field of conformal dimension\r
E = 1 under conformal transformations in the compactified coordinates.

Remarkably, the two-point function of the transformed field 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) has essentially\r
the same form as (3.241), up to a conformally invariant factor. Specifically, by\r
starting from the original two-point function (3.241) and considering the conformal\r
transformation (3.239) together with the corresponding conformal distance relation\r
(analogous to (3.214)), we obtain:\r

One notes that 𝑾(𝑧, 𝑢) incorporates the conformal weight, thereby ensuring the\r
correct transformation behavior under conformal mappings.\r
It is important to emphasize that the asymmetry between the two factors 𝜙ˆ(𝑥1)\r
and 𝜙ˆ(𝑥2), manifested through the presence of (· · · − i0)\r
2\r
(or, equivalently, through\r
the support of the Fourier transform) in (3.241), persists in the analytic (𝑧-)picture\r
— though it is no longer apparent in the notation used in (3.244). Strictly speaking,\r
the function 𝑾(𝑧, 𝑢) is analytic for 𝑢 ∈ 𝔗\r

domain surrounding the point at infinity.\r
This reformulation sets the stage for introducing and illustrating the fundamen\u0002tal structures of a higher-dimensional conformal vertex algebra. Through explicit\r
computations, it reveals several unexpected features of the familiar free scalar field\r
theory.\r

as arising\r
from 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) via the conformal inversion.\r
— Step I (conformal inversion and Weyl scaling). Conformal inversion reads\r

3.5 4-dimensional Conformal Vertex Algebra\r
QFT is primarily concerned with the vacuum representation of products of quantum\r
fields. The algebra of globally conformally invariant fields — such as free massless\r
fields and their operator product expansions — fits naturally into the framework of\r
a 4-dimensional (or higher) vertex algebra, as developed in Ref. [114] and further\r
summarized in Section 4.3 of Ref. [115]. This formalism not only generalizes the\r
structure of field products beyond perturbation theory but also offers a more natural\r
and conceptually unified perspective than the explicit classification of individual\r
UPEIRs. We now proceed to outline its key features.\r
The states of the theory span a (pre-)Hilbert space23 H that carries a (reducible)\r
unitary representation 𝑈 of the conformal group U(2, 2), featuring a unique con\u000223 A “pre-Hilbert space” is a complex vector space equipped with a positive-definite inner product,\r
but not necessarily complete with respect to the induced norm. Its completion yields a Hilbert\r
space. In many QFT settings — especially CFT — the natural space of states is first defined as a\r
dense subspace of a Hilbert space, typically consisting of finite-energy or polynomially bounded\r
states. This subspace suffices for algebraic constructions, such as operator products and the action\r
of symmetry generators, and is often referred to as a pre-Hilbert space. The completion is then\r
required to rigorously establish limits and convergence. Thus, the term “pre-Hilbert space” reflects\r
whether one is working directly with the dense, physically meaningful subspace or with its Hilbert\r
space completion, depending on the level of mathematical rigor required.

Proposition 3.7 — (spectral decomposition of the conformal Hamiltonian). Let\r
H be a (pre-)Hilbert space carrying a (possibly reducible) unitary positive-energy\r
representation of the conformal group U(2, 2), and let 𝐻 := i𝐽05 (3.190) (see also\r
(3.193)) denote the conformal Hamiltonian, which is essentially self-adjoint and\r
bounded from below. Then:\r
1. The spectrum of 𝐻 is purely discrete and non-negative:\r
Spec(𝐻) =\r
n\r
E ∈ R≥0 ; E = 0, 1,\r
3\r
2\r
, 2, . . . o, (3.257)\r
where each eigenvalue E has finite multiplicity.\r
2. The space H decomposes into a direct sum of (finite-dimensional) eigenspaces\r
HEof the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻:\r
H =\r
Ê\r
E ∈Spec(𝐻)\r
HE, such that (𝐻 − E )HE = 0 . (3.258)\r

U(2,2)\r
⟩spans the lowest-energy (1-dimensional)\r
eigenspace:\r
HE =0 = C |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ . (3.259)\r
4. Each eigenspace HEis generally not invariant under the full conformal group\r
U(2, 2); rather, it is preserved only by the maximal compact subgroup Spin(4).\r
This can be seen as a consequence of Proposition 3.4, particularly as established\r
in Step III of its proof. More precisely, each HEcarries a (generally reducible)\r
finite-dimensional representation of Spin(4) \u001B SO(4). The central element −14 ∈\r
Spin(4) acts on states in HEby multiplication with their parity, given by:\r

Restricting attention to quantum fields 𝜙ˆ and 𝜓ˆ of definite parity, we assign to\r

This reflects the field’s transformation under the central element −14 ∈ Spin(4).\r
The sign ‘±’ determines the intrinsic parity of the field; even-parity (bosonic) fields\r
correspond to P = 0, and odd-parity (fermionic) fields to P = 1. As discussed\r
below, this assignment endows the fields with a Z2 grading that enters the strong\r
(Huygens) locality condition, governing whether fields commute or anticommute in\r
the graded operator algebra.\r
The strong (Huygens) locality condition assumes:24\r

\u0011\r
= 0 , (3.265)\r
for some sufficiently large integer 𝑁. The prefactor (𝑧 − 𝑢)\r
2\r
\u0001 𝑁\r
ensures that the\r
expression vanishes in the coincident limit𝑧 → 𝑢 and encodes the allowed singularity\r
structure in the operator product expansion. For a concrete example of this singular\r
behavior, see Eq. (3.244).\r
Proposition 3.8 The strong (or Huygens) locality condition (3.265), valid for some\r
sufficiently large integer 𝑁, reflects the fact that any pair of mutually nonisotropic\r
(non-null) points (𝑧, 𝑢) — that is, with (𝑧 −𝑢)\r
2 ≠ 0 — belongs to a single orbit of the\r
conformal group SU(2, 2) acting on compactified Minkowski space. In this global\r
setting, the invariant notion is not spacelike versus timelike separation, but rather\r
the null/non-null distinction.\r
Before turning to the proof, let us clarify the conceptual role of this condi\u0002tion. In flat Minkowski spacetime, strong (Huygens) locality is nothing more than\r
the operator-algebraic expression of microcausality; fields either commute or anti\u0002commute when evaluated at spacelike separated arguments. This interpretation is\r
24 In the strong (Huygens) locality condition, the parity degrees determine the exchange symmetry:\r
1. If both fields are bosonic (P𝜙ˆ = P𝜓ˆ = 0): (−1)\r
0×0 = +1, then the fields commute.\r
2. If both fields are fermionic (P𝜙ˆ = P𝜓ˆ = 1): (−1)\r
1×1 = −1, then the fields anticommute.\r
3. If one field is bosonic and the other fermionic (P𝜙ˆ = 0, P𝜓ˆ = 1 or vice versa): (−1)\r
0×1 =\r
(−1)\r
1×0 = +1, then the fields commute.

unambiguous, since the local conformal group preserves the causal type of separa\u0002tion vectors, and hence the distinction between spacelike and timelike pairs is sharp\r
(see the proof below).\r
After conformal compactification, however, the situation changes essentially. The\r
global conformal group SU(2, 2) preserves null separations exactly, but no longer\r
preserves the spacelike/timelike distinction; under compactified conformal transfor\u0002mations, a spacelike pair may be mapped to a timelike one (see the proof below).\r
What remains invariant is therefore only the null versus non-null classification. In\r
this global setting, the strong locality condition must be reinterpreted: it is not “lo\u0002cality” in the conventional causal sense, but rather a conformally covariant regularity\r
requirement on operator products. Concretely, it guarantees that graded commuta\u0002tors vanish (up to their prescribed short-distance singularities) throughout the full\r
conformal orbit of non-null pairs under SU(2, 2).\r
When restricted back to the Minkowski patch, this broader condition reduces\r
precisely to the familiar microcausality principle, thereby reconciling the local and\r
global viewpoints.\r
Proof A rigorous proof of this proposition can be found in Ref. [114]. Here, however,\r
we outline an alternative approach that serves certain illustrative or pedagogical\r
purposes.\r
— Step I (transitive action of the conformal group on non-null point pairs\r
in Minkowski spacetime). Let 𝑀 \u001B R\r
3,1 denote flat Minkowski spacetime, whose\r
conformal group is locally isomorphic to SU(2, 2). This group acts transitively on\r
the set of ordered point pairs (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈ R\r
3,1 × R3,1 with (𝑥 − 𝑦)2 ≠ 0, provided the\r
causal type of the separation vector is fixed (spacelike or timelike). We elaborate on\r
this point below.\r
Let (𝑥, 𝑦) and (𝑥\r
′\r
, 𝑦′) be two such pairs with (𝑥 − 𝑦)\r
2 ≠ 0 ≠ (𝑥′ − 𝑦′\r
)\r
2\r
, and\r
with the same causal type. We construct a conformal transformation 𝑔˜𝑐 mapping\r
𝑥 ↦−→ 𝑥\r
′\r
and 𝑦 ↦−→ 𝑦\r
′\r
. Since the conformal group includes translations, Lorentz\r
transformations, dilations, and special conformal transformations, we can actually\r
realize such a conformal transformation as a composition of elementary operations;\r
specifically:\r
1. Translate 𝑥 to the origin by 𝑇𝑥 (𝐴) = 𝐴 − 𝑥, which maps the original pair (𝑥, 𝑦) to\r
(0, 𝑟), where 𝑟 = 𝑦 − 𝑥. Note that, as assumed in the proposition, 𝑟 ≠ 0.\r
2. Similarly, define 𝑟\r
′ = 𝑦′ −𝑥′\r
\r
≠ 0\r
\u0001\r
, so that the target pair (𝑥\r
′\r
, 𝑦′) becomes (0, 𝑟′)\r
after translation by 𝑥\r
′\r
.\r
3. Apply a dilation 𝐷 𝜚 (𝐴) = 𝜚𝐴 with scale factor 𝜚 =\r
√︂\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
(𝑟\r
′\r
)\r
2\r
(𝑟 )\r
2\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
> 0. Then, the\r
rescaled vector 𝜚𝑟 has the same invariant length as 𝑟\r
′\r
.\r
4. Since 𝑟 and 𝑟\r
′\r
are both non-null and of the same causal type, there exists a Lorentz\r
transformation Λ ∈ SO(3, 1) such that Λ(𝜚𝑟) = 𝑟\r
′\r
; recall that the Lorentz group\r
SO(3, 1) preserves the Minkowski norm and causal character.\r
5. Undo the translation of the target pair by applying 𝑇\r
−1\r
𝑥\r
′ (𝐴) = 𝐴 + 𝑥\r
′\r
.\r
Then, the complete transformation, which maps spacelike (respectively timelike)\r
pairs to spacelike (respectively timelike) pairs, is:

, (3.266)\r
satisfying:\r
𝑔˜𝑐 (𝑥) = 𝑥\r
′\r
, 𝑔˜𝑐 (𝑦) = 𝑦\r
′\r
. (3.267)\r
— Step II (extension to compactified Minkowski space). We now invoke the\r
conformal compactification, 𝑔𝑐\r
\r
𝑀\r
\u0001\r
= 𝑀compact, where the globally defined map 𝑔𝑐 is\r
specified in Eq. (3.211), with its inverse given in Eq. (3.239). Let:\r
𝑧 = 𝑔𝑐 (𝑥) , 𝑢 = 𝑔𝑐 (𝑦) , 𝑧′ = 𝑔𝑐 (𝑥\r
′\r
) , 𝑢′ = 𝑔𝑐 (𝑦\r
′\r
) . (3.268)\r
Under the globally defined map 𝑔𝑐 (3.211) (or similarly its reverse (3.239)), the\r
squared interval transforms according to (3.214):\r
(𝑧 − 𝑢)\r
2 =\r
(𝑥 − 𝑦)\r
2\r
Ω(𝑥) Ω(𝑦)\r
, (3.269)\r
where the Weyl factors Ω(𝑥) and Ω(𝑦) are generally complex (not strictly positive!).\r
Consequently, unlike the local map 𝑔˜𝑐 introduced above, the global transformation\r
𝑔𝑐 does not preserve the causal type of a pair of points; it preserves only the non-null\r
separation:\r
(𝑥 − 𝑦)\r
2 ≠ 0 ⇐⇒ (𝑧 − 𝑢)2 ≠ 0 . (3.270)\r
Nevertheless, even though the global map 𝑔𝑐 does not preserve the spacelike or\r
timelike character of vectors, the conformal group still acts transitively on the set of\r
mutually non-isotropic (non-null) point pairs in 𝑀compact:\r

(𝑧\r

)\r
2≠ 0\r
. (3.271)\r
— Step III (conclusion/implications for strong locality). The strong locality\r
condition (3.265) reflects the conformal orbit structure in the following sense. For\r
fields 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) and 𝜓ˆ(𝑢), the graded (anti-)commutator:\r
\u0010\r
𝜙ˆ(𝑧)𝜓ˆ(𝑢) − (−1)\r
P𝜙ˆ P𝜓ˆ 𝜓ˆ(𝑢)𝜙ˆ(𝑧)\r
\u0011\r
(3.272)\r
is not identically zero for general configurations, but the condition:\r
\u0010\r
(𝑧 − 𝑢)\r
2\r
\u0011 𝑁 \u0010\r
. . . \u0011= 0 (3.273)\r
is required to be smooth and covariant under SU(2, 2) on the domain where (𝑧−𝑢)\r
2 ≠\r
0. The prefactor (𝑧 − 𝑢)\r
2\r
\u0001 𝑁\r
therefore plays two complementary roles:

116 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
1. Regularization of singularities: It removes the divergences that occur in the\r
coincidence limit 𝑧 → 𝑢, ensuring a well-defined operator product expansion.\r
2. Uniformity across the conformal orbit: Because all non-null pairs (𝑧, 𝑢) belong\r
to a single conformal orbit, the prefactor guarantees that the (anti-)commutator\r
vanishes consistently on the entire orbit, enforcing compatibility with the global\r
conformal symmetry.\r
Thus, the strong locality condition encodes a fundamental geometric and algebraic\r
feature of CFT: it manifests conformal invariance at the level of the operator algebra,\r
imposing global constraints on field (anti-)commutators in accordance with the orbit\r
structure of compactified Minkowski space. When restricted to the Minkowski patch,\r
this condition reduces to the familiar microcausality principle, ensuring that fields\r
commute or anticommute at spacelike separation. □\r
Proposition 3.9 The essence of the theory of conformal vertex algebra is contained\r
in the following statements [115]:\r
1. The expansion 𝜙ˆ(𝑧)|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ contains no negative powers of (𝑧)\r
2\r
. That is, any\r
term in the field 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) (see Eq. (3.261)) involving negative powers of (𝑧)\r
2 — and\r
hence singular at the origin — must annihilate the conformally invariant vacuum\r
|0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩.\r
2. Every local component 𝜙ˆ\r
𝑖(𝑧) is uniquely determined by the vector |𝑣𝑖⟩, defined\r
as:\r
|𝑣𝑖⟩ := 𝜙ˆ\r
𝑖(0) |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ , such that (−1)\r

|𝑣𝑖⟩ = (−1)\r
2𝐻 |𝑣𝑖⟩ . (3.274)\r
3. If |𝑣⟩ := 𝜙ˆ(0) |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ is an eigenstate of the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 with\r
eigenvalue E , i.e., (𝐻 −E ) |𝑣⟩ = 0, then E is identified with the scaling dimension\r
of the field 𝜙ˆ. In the case of free (massless) fields, E coincides with the canonical\r
dimension of the field: E = 1 for a massless scalar field (see footnote 14 and\r
22); E =\r
3\r
2\r
for a Weyl spinor field with helicity 𝜆 = ±\r
1\r
2\r
; more generally, E\r
increases with spin, following the free-field scaling dimension. Conversely, a field\r
with E =\r
1\r
2\r
would represent a subcanonical scaling dimension, incompatible with\r
unitarity and in violation of Wightman’s Hilbert space positivity condition.\r
4. If |𝑣⟩ := 𝜙ˆ(0) |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩ is the lowest-energy state within an irreducible subrepre\u0002sentation of the conformal group (i.e., a lowest weight state), then it is annihi\u0002lated by all special conformal generators 𝐶𝑖\r
|𝑣⟩ = 0 (see Proposition 3.4). Such\r
states are referred to as quasiprimary in Ref. [115], adopting terminology from\r
2-dimensional CFT, where the notion originates.\r
5. For every vector |𝑣⟩ := 𝜙ˆ(0) |0\r

If we now assume that |𝑣⟩ is a lowest weight state, i.e., it is annihilated by all\r
special conformal generators 𝐶𝑖, then E = E◦ is the minimal eigenvalue of 𝐻. For\r
such states, and for sufficiently small 𝑚 (in particular for 𝑚 = 0), terms with 𝑛 < 0\r
would imply the existence of states with energy below E = E◦, contradicting the\r

3.7 Appendix: de Sitter (dS) Massless Unitary Irreducible\r
Representations (UIRs)\r
We begin again with the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and its “second\u0002quantized” ladder generators 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑), with 𝜇, 𝜈 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (see Eq.

3.7 Appendix: de Sitter (dS) Massless Unitary Irreducible Representations (UIRs) 121\r
(3.34)). In this context, one may obtain the dS algebra by restricting attention to the\r
generators 𝐽𝛼𝛽, with 𝛼, 𝛽 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and discarding the generators 𝐽𝛼5; this yields\r
a 10-dimensional subalgebra isomorphic to 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1). In particular, the\r
conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 = i𝐽05 does not belong to the dS subalgebra and therefore\r
cannot serve as a global energy operator or as an energy label E for dS UIRs; dS\r
representations are not classified by a global energy eigenvalue in the same way as\r
anti-dS representations (see Ref. [29]).\r
The maximal compact subalgebra of the dS algebra is 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅,\r
generated by 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 with 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3, 4. Every state in a dS UIR can be labeled by\r
the compact quantum numbers (j𝐿, j𝑅), where again j𝐿 and j𝑅 are the familiar\r
SU(2) spins associated with the left and right SU(2) factors [93]. We now proceed\r
to elaborate on the structure and interpretation of these labels.\r
A multiplet will denote the collection of states |j𝐿, j𝑅; 𝑚𝐿, 𝑚𝑅⟩ transforming\r
irreducibly under 𝑆U(2)𝐿 × 𝑆U(2)𝑅 with fixed (j𝐿, j𝑅), where 𝑚𝐿 = −j𝐿, . . . , j𝐿\r
and 𝑚𝑅 = −j𝑅, . . . , j𝑅 label the magnetic quantum numbers. The dimension d of\r
such a multiplet is (2j𝐿 +1) (2j𝑅 +1) (see Eq. (3.150)). The compact generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗\r
act within each multiplet, mixing the magnetic quantum numbers while preserving\r
the total spins (j𝐿, j𝑅).\r
The remaining generators 𝐽0𝑖 (with 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 4), which span the noncompact\r
directions of 𝔰𝔬(4, 1), act between multiplets. Their commutation relations with the\r
compact generators are:\r
\u0002\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗, 𝐽0𝑘\r
\u0003\r
=\r
\r
𝜂 𝑗𝑘 𝐽0𝑖 − 𝜂𝑖𝑘 𝐽0 𝑗\r
\u0001\r
, (3.291)\r
which shows that the operators 𝐽0𝑖transform in the vector (4-dimensional) rep\u0002resentation of the compact group SO(4). Under the homomorphism SO(4) \u001B\r
SU(2)𝐿 × SU(2)𝑅, this 4-vector corresponds to the bi-spinor representation \r

\r
1\r
2\r
,\r
1\r
2\r
\u0001\r
= (1 + 1) (1 + 1) = 4.\r
When 𝐽0𝑖 acts on a compact multiplet (j𝐿, j𝑅) it therefore produces states in the\r
tensor product:\r
(j𝐿, j𝑅) ⊗ \r
1\r
2\r
,\r
1\r

, (3.292)\r
with the obvious convention that any term with a negative spin is omitted. Thus, the\r
noncompact generators connect up to four neighboring SO(4) multiplets; repeated\r
application of the noncompact generators builds a “tower of multiplets” which,\r
together with the action of the compact algebra, spans the full UIR Hilbert space.\r
Remark 3.18 The foregoing “tower of SO(4) multiplets” picture is the natural de\u0002scription for the dS discrete-series type representations (those admitting lowest or\r
highest weight with respect to the compact subalgebra). For the dS principal-series\r
and complementary-series representations, the structure is different (continuous la\u0002bels arise and the decomposition into compact multiplets must be handled with the\r
appropriate spectral-theoretic tools), so the seed-multiplet construction should be\r
understood in the appropriate representational context. □

122 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
In summary, a dS UIR decomposes into a (generally countable) collection of\r
SO(4) multiplets (j𝐿, j𝑅). The compact generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 act within each multiplet,\r
whereas the noncompact generators 𝐽0𝑖link multiplets according to the Clebsch\u0002Gordan decomposition with \r
1\r
2\r
,\r
1\r
2\r
\u0001\r
; there is no analogue of a globally conserved\r
energy label as in anti-dS space.\r
For the dS massless UIRs, the structure simplifies. As a direct consequence of the\r
preceding discussion, the full Hilbert space is generated from a chiral seed multiplet:\r
(j𝐿, j𝑅) = (𝑠, 0) or (0, 𝑠) , with 𝑠 := |𝜆| = 0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . . , (3.293)\r
where the helicity is encoded in the chirality of the seed multiplet (see Remark 3.10):\r
(𝑠, 0) −→ (helicity + 𝑠) , (0, 𝑠) −→ (helicity − 𝑠) . (3.294)\r
In Dixmier’s notation [93], the corresponding massless dS representations are\r
written as:\r
Π\r
+\r
𝑠,𝑠 and Π\r
−\r
𝑠,𝑠 , (3.295)\r
respectively. Here, the general Dixmier labels Π\r
±\r
𝑝,𝑞 may be read off from the SO(4)-\r
content of the representation; one convenient characterization is:\r
𝑝 := inf\r
(j𝐿 ,j𝑅 ) ∈spec\r
\f\r
\fj𝐿 − j𝑅\r
\f\r
\f\r
, 𝑞 := sup\r
(j𝐿 ,j𝑅 ) ∈spec\r
\f\r
\fj𝐿 + j𝑅\r
\f\r
\f\r
, (3.296)\r
where the infimum and supremum are taken over the set of compact multiplets\r
(j𝐿, j𝑅) occurring in the UIR. [Equivalently, the parameters 𝑝 and 𝑞 can be extracted\r
from the eigenvalues of the dS quadratic and quartic Casimir operators; see the\r
discussions in Sect. 1.3.] For the massless case generated by a chiral seed (𝑠, 0) or\r
(0, 𝑠), one indeed has 𝑝 = 𝑞 = 𝑠, whence the notation Π\r
±\r
𝑠,𝑠; the superscript ‘±’\r
records the helicity sign (chirality) of the seed multiplet.\r

domain associated with the conformal group [117, 118, 119].

3.9 Appendix: The Lie Algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and its Euclidean 𝔰𝔬(5, 1) Counterpart; the 𝑧-Picture of the 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) Generators123\r
Indeed, the conformal group SO(4, 2) is locally isomorphic to SU(2, 2), and there\r
are two equivalent realizations of the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space. On\r
the one hand, SU(2, 2) acts transitively on the Cartan domain of type I:\r
𝐷\r
I\r
2,2 =\r
SU(2, 2)\r
S\r
\r
U(2) × U(2)\r
\u0001 , (3.298)\r
whose Shilov boundary is canonically identified with U(2). Using the standard\r
topological identification:\r
U(2) \u001B\r
S\r
3 × S1\r
Z2\r
, (3.299)\r
one recovers 𝑀compact as this Shilov boundary.\r
On the other hand, via the isomorphism SU(2, 2) ≃ SO(4, 2), the same symmetric\r
space can be realized as the Cartan domain of type IV (the Lie ball):\r
𝐷\r
IV\r
4 =\r
SO(4, 2)\r
\r
SO(2) × SO(4)\r
\u0001 , (3.300)\r
whose Shilov boundary is the projectivized null cone in R\r
4,2\r
. This boundary is\r
precisely the conformal compactification of Minkowski space.\r
Thus, depending on the chosen realization, 𝑀compact appears either as:\r
1. The Shilov boundary of the type-I domain 𝐷\r
I\r
2,2\r
, or equivalently\r
2. The Shilov boundary of the type-IV domain 𝐷\r
IV\r

.\r
Both descriptions are canonically equivalent and reflect the dual realizations of the\r
conformal symmetric space associated with SO(4, 2).\r
3.9 Appendix: The Lie Algebra 𝖘𝖔(4, 2) and its Euclidean\r
𝖘𝖔(5, 1) Counterpart; the 𝒛-Picture of the 𝖘𝖔(4, 2) Generators\r
In the context of the present study, it is natural to introduce the 𝑧-picture realization of\r
the conformal generators acting on compactified Minkowski space 𝑀compact \u001B (S\r
3 ×\r
S\r
1\r
)/Z2 \u001B U(2). Specifically, we consider the infinitesimal translation generators\r
𝑇𝑖 (3.188), the special conformal transformations 𝐶𝑖 (3.189), and the conformal\r
Hamiltonian 𝐻 (3.190) (see also (3.193)), as realized via differential operators in\r
the complex coordinate variables 𝑧\r
𝑖 = 𝑧𝑖 ∈ 𝑀compact, with 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, introduced in\r
Eqs. (3.204)-(3.211).\r
To achieve this goal, we consider functions defined on Dirac’s projective quadric\r
P𝑄, which arises by projectivizing P the null cone 𝑄 (3.202) in R\r
4,2\r
:\r
P𝑄 := 𝑄/R>0 , (3.301)

where 𝜇, 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and the ambient metric 𝜂𝜇𝜈 on R\r
4,2 has signature\r
(−, −, +, +, +, +).\r
Some fundamental properties of Dirac’s projective quadric P𝑄 and related struc\u0002tures are as follows:\r
1. Null directions in R\r
4,2\r
: P𝑄 consists of all null directions (rays) through the\r
origin in R\r
4,2\r
. Concretely, two nonzero null vectors 𝜁 and 𝜁\r
′\r
are considered\r
equivalent if they differ by a positive scalar:\r
𝜁 ∼ 𝜚𝜁 , where 𝜚 ∈ R>0 . (3.303)\r
Each equivalence class corresponds to a single point on the projectivized light\r
cone, capturing the direction of the vector while ignoring its length.\r
2. Topology and conformal compactification: The resulting space P𝑄 is a com\u0002pact, 4-dimensional manifold. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to (S\r
3×S1\r
)/Z2.\r
This identification arises from the null condition 𝜁\r
2 = 0, which imposes that\r
the spatial components (𝜁1, . . . , 𝜁4) and the temporal components (𝜁0, 𝜁5) lie\r
on spheres of equal radius — that is, 𝜁\r
2\r
1\r
+ · · · + 𝜁\r
2\r
4\r
= 𝜁\r
2\r
0\r
+ 𝜁\r
2\r
5 — thus defining\r
S\r
3\r
and S\r
1\r
, respectively. The Z2 quotient reflects the projectivization of null di\u0002rections, identifying antipodal points along each ray via 𝜁 ∼ −𝜁. Consequently,\r
P𝑄 serves as the conformal compactification of Minkowski spacetime:\r
P𝑄 \u001B (S\r
3 × S1\r
)/Z2\r
| {z }\r
\u001B U(2)\r
\u001B 𝑀compact. (3.304)\r
3. Embedding of Minkowski space: To complete the foregoing, Minkowski space\u0002time 𝑀 \u001B R\r
3,1\r
can be embedded in P𝑄 in terms of the (dimensionless, homo\u0002geneous) coordinates as follows:\r
𝑥\r
𝜇¤ =\r
𝜁\r
𝜇¤\r
𝜁\r
5 + 𝜁4\r
, 𝜇¤ = 0, 1, 2, 3\r
=⇒ (𝑥)\r

:= 𝑥\r
𝜇¤\r

(𝜁\r
5\r
)\r
2 − (𝜁4\r
)\r
2\r
\r
𝜁\r
5 + 𝜁4\r
\u00012\r
=\r
𝜁\r
5 − 𝜁4\r
𝜁\r
5 + 𝜁4\r
. (3.305)\r
The consistency of the above relations is verified by substituting 𝑥\r
𝜇¤\r
and (𝑥)\r
2\r
, as\r
given above, into Eq. (3.211), which yields Eq. (3.204).\r
4. Action of the conformal group SO(4, 2): The conformal group acts linearly on\r
the ambient space R\r
4,2\r
, preserving the null cone 𝑄. This action descends natu\u0002rally to the projectivized cone P𝑄, inducing a well-defined projective action on\r
compactified Minkowski space. Concretely, the Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) is realized\r
on Dirac’s projective quadric by first-order differential operators of the form:

3.9 Appendix: The Lie Algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and its Euclidean 𝔰𝔬(5, 1) Counterpart; the 𝑧-Picture of the 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) Generators125\r
𝑋𝜇𝜈 = −𝑋𝜈𝜇\u0001= 𝜁𝜇𝜕𝜈 − 𝜁𝜈 𝜕𝜇, 𝜕𝜇:=\r
𝜕\r
𝜕𝜁 𝜇\r
, (3.306)\r
which satisfy the commutation relations (3.37). In this way, Dirac’s projective\r
quadric furnishes a natural geometric stage for the global action of the conformal\r
group, making manifest the realization of conformal symmetry on compactified\r
Minkowski space.\r
5. Generators of translations and special conformal transformations: The Lie\r
algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), defined via differential operators acting on smooth functions\r
over Minkowski spacetime, is generated by the infinitesimal translations and\r
special conformal transformations. Specifically, the infinitesimal translations\r
are given by:\r
i𝑝𝜇¤ = 𝜕𝜇¤:=\r
𝜕\r
𝜕𝑥𝜇¤\r
, (3.307)\r
where 𝑝𝜇¤ denotes the 4-momentum. The special conformal generators are de\u0002fined as:\r
i𝑘 𝜇¤ = (𝑥)\r
2\r
𝜕𝜇¤ − 2𝑥𝜇¤ (𝑥 · 𝜕) . (3.308)\r
The Lie brackets of these generators generate the full conformal Lie algebra,\r
including the Lorentz transformations 𝑥𝜇¤ 𝜕𝜈¤ − 𝑥𝜈¤ 𝜕𝜇¤ and the dilatation operator\r
𝑥 · 𝜕. In particular, the commutator between translation and special conformal\r
generators reads:\r
\u0002\r
i𝑘𝜈¤, i𝑝𝜇¤\r
\u0003\r
= 2 𝜂𝜇¤ 𝜈¤ (𝑥 · 𝜕) − 2\r
\r
𝑥𝜇¤ 𝜕𝜈¤ − 𝑥𝜈¤ 𝜕𝜇¤\r
\u0001\r
. (3.309)\r
We recall our mostly ‘+’ convention for the metric signature in R\r
4,2\r
; 𝜂11 = · · · =\r
𝜂44 = +1, while 𝜂00 = 𝜂55 = −1. The vector fields i𝑝𝜇¤ and i𝑘 𝜇¤ are related to the\r
generators 𝑋𝜇𝜈 (3.306) by:\r
i𝑝𝜇¤ = 𝑋𝜇¤5 − 𝑋𝜇¤4 , i𝑘𝜇¤ = 𝑋𝜇¤5 + 𝑋𝜇¤4 . (3.310)\r

then a compactly supported disturbance at a spacetime point 𝑥◦ propagates\r
exclusively along the light cone (𝑥 −𝑥◦)\r
2 = 0. In particular, the solution exhibits\r
no tail inside the cone: the field vanishes identically both inside and outside the\r
null hypersurface determined by 𝑥◦. Hence, the causal propagation of massless\r
signals is completely governed by null directions.\r
Within the projective framework, this principle admits a natural geometric for\u0002mulation. Each point 𝜁 ∈ P𝑄 encodes a null direction in spacetime and thus\r
determines a lightlike ray along which massless disturbances propagate. Via the\r
homogeneous embedding (3.305), the ambient null condition 𝜁\r
2 = 0 projects\r
precisely onto the spacetime light-cone condition (𝑥−𝑥◦)\r
2 = 0. Families of such\r
rays generate wavefronts, while caustics arise at points where the projection from\r
P𝑄 to spacetime fails to be regular, namely:\r
det 𝜕𝑥𝜇¤\r
𝜕𝜃𝑖\r
= 0 , (3.316)\r
with 𝜃\r
𝑖 parametrizing the ray family. Since P𝑄 is compact and carries a natural\r
action of the conformal group, this description is global and conformally in\u0002variant, providing a robust geometric framework for analyzing the propagation\r
and focusing of massless perturbations, notably in cosmological and inflationary\r
applications.\r

Conformal Massless Low Helicity Fields and\r
their de Sitter (dS) Spacetime Restriction\r
Abstract This chapter presents a systematic construction of low-helicity conformal\r
massless fields, with particular emphasis on the zero-helicity case in de Sitter (dS)\r
spacetime. It begins by formulating the massless scalar field in terms of ladder-type\r
vertex operators built from Bose creation and annihilation operators, supplemented\r
by zero-mode operators that ensure the correct lowest-energy states and reproduce\r
the canonical two-point functions. The analytic structure of these operators is estab\u0002lished within a precompact tube domain, ensuring convergence of the corresponding\r
harmonic polynomial expansions.\r
Subsequently, it describes the restriction of conformal massless fields from the\r
6-dimensional conformal space to 4-dimensional dS spacetime, emphasizing the role\r
of homogeneous functions on the light cone and the associated gauge freedom. The\r
construction elucidates the relation between Euclidean coordinates in the analyti\u0002cally continued half-space and Minkowski-type coordinates, highlighting the Weyl\r
rescaling that connects the conformally flat metric to the standard dS metric.\r
Finally, the chapter demonstrates how the 6-dimensional conformally invariant\r
two-point functions project naturally onto dS spacetime, yielding the standard dS\r
two-point functions for massless scalar fields. These results provide a rigorous frame\u0002work for understanding the interplay between conformal symmetry, low helicity\r
fields, and their geometric realization in curved spacetimes.\r

1. The presence of the zero-modes 𝜒 and 𝜒\r

2. The fact that |1, 0, 0⟩ is a minimal-energy state in the conformally invariant zero\u0002helicity subspace H\r

Remark 4.1 In this context, before proceeding with the proof, it is important to\r
emphasize that the vacuum state |0\r
U(2,2)\r

annihilated by all infinitesimal generators of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2); the\r
explicit form of these generators can be found in Chap. 3. Explicitly:\r

Remark 4.5 In this context, a few points merit further clarification:\r
1. The real (dimensionless) Cartesian coordinates of the EdS half-space, defined in\r
Eq. (4.23), are connected to the analytically continued versions of the coordinates\r
𝑧𝑖introduced in Eq. (3.204). Specifically, setting:\r
𝜁\r
5 = 𝑅 > 0 , and 𝜁𝛽 = 𝑅 tanh 𝛽 > 0\r
\r
=⇒ 𝛽 > 0\r
\u0001\r
, (4.24)\r
we have:\r
𝑧𝑖 =\r
𝜁𝑖\r
𝑅 + 𝜁𝛽\r
=\r
𝜅𝜁𝑖\r
1 + 𝜅𝜁𝛽\r
, (4.25)\r
where 𝜅 =\r
1\r
𝑅\r
denotes the scalar curvature of EdS \u001B S\r
4\r
𝑅\r
. It then follows that (𝑧)\r
2\r
is obtained as an analytic continuation of (3.209):\r

Note that 𝜅𝜁𝛽 = tanh 𝛽, with 𝛽 > 0. From this realization, one can observe that:\r
a. Given the equation above and the strict positivity of 𝛽, it follows immediately\r
that:\r
\f\r

the hyperplane 𝜁\r

(3.218), where the\r
vector-valued function 𝜙ˆ\r

b. The label 𝛽 in the imaginary time coordinate i𝜁𝛽 is chosen to evoke the\r
Boltzmann factor 𝛽 =\r
1\r
𝐾𝑇 , where 𝑇 denotes the absolute temperature and 𝐾\r
is the Boltzmann constant. This choice reflects the fact that the analytically\r
continued two-point function of the field 𝜙ˆ(𝜁)|0⟩ admits an interpretation as\r
a thermal correlation function (see [115], particularly Sect. 7). In this context,\r
𝛽 can be understood as a real continuation of the imaginary proper time i𝜏,\r
where 𝜏 is the physical proper time (compare Eqs. (3.209) and (4.26)).

Note that summation over the repeated index ‘𝑖’ from 1 to 4 is assumed throughout.\r
3. Coming back to the real dS spacetime with Lorentzian signature, we can express\r
the Minkowski coordinate 𝑥\r
𝜇¤\r
(of dimension of length) in terms of the O(4, 1)\r
covariant vector 𝜁 (4.22) by the following relations:\r

where, again, 𝜇¤ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Then, in complex analogy with (4.29), we have:1\r
(d𝜁)\r
2\r
\u0010\r

2 + (d𝜁4)2\r

4. The expression (4.29) and (4.32) involve different small curvature (𝑅 → ∞ or\r
𝜅 → 0) limits:\r
a. EdS case: For 𝜁𝛽 ≈ 𝑅 (or 𝜅𝜁𝛽 ≈ 1) and hence |𝜁𝑖| ≪ 𝑅, we have:\r

□\r
We now proceed to write down the field (wave) equation and the two-point\r
function for a conformal (massless) scalar field in (E)dS space.\r
Working in conformal space — without imposing the dS constraint 𝜁\r

are only well-defined on the light cone (𝜁)\r
2 = 0, if 𝜙 is homogeneous of degree −1.\r
Specifically, if 𝜙(𝜁) satisfies the homogeneity condition:\r
𝜙(𝜚𝜁) = 𝜚\r
𝑑\r
𝜙(𝜁) , for all 𝜚 > 0 , (4.38)\r
then the equation □6𝜙 = 0 defines a conformally invariant field only on the quadric\r
(𝜁)\r
2 = 0 provided that 𝑑 = −1.\r
This requirement arises from a subtle invariance:\r
1. Since the physical field 𝜙(𝜁) is defined only on the cone (𝜁)\r
2 = 0, it can be freely\r
modified by adding terms proportional to (𝜁)\r
2\r
, without affecting its restriction\r
to the cone; that is:

𝜙(𝜁) ↦−→ 𝜙(𝜁) + (𝜁)\r
2𝝓(𝜁) , (4.39)\r
where the new field 𝝓(𝜁) is assumed to be homogeneous of degree 𝑑 − 2:\r
𝝓(𝜚𝜁) = 𝜚\r
𝑑−2𝝓(𝜁) , for all 𝜚 > 0 . (4.40)\r
2. To ensure that the gauge-transformed function 𝜙(𝜁) + (𝜁)\r
2𝝓(𝜁) still satisfies\r
d’Alembert equation (4.37) on the cone, we require that:\r

This condition holds only if 𝑑 = −1. The reason follows from the commutator\r
(see Appendix 4.3):\r
\u0002\r

For 𝜁D= (𝜁\r

dS)\r
2\r
and (𝜁D)\r
2 = 0 = (𝜁′\r
D\r
)\r
2\r
, it is natural to expect that a conformally invariant two-point\r
function on dS spacetime (see, for instance, Ref. [49]\r
3\r
) can be recovered from the\r
manifestly invariant one defined on the 6-dimensional light cone. In this setting, the\r
corresponding two-point function takes the form:\r
2 For any sufficiently smooth function 𝑓 (𝜁 ), from the commutator (4.42), we have:\r
□𝑛\r
\u0010\r

2\r

= 2𝑛 𝑓 + 4𝜁\r
𝜇 𝜕 𝑓\r

+ (𝜁 )\r
2□𝑛 𝑓 ,\r
so that, on the cone (𝜁 )\r
2 = 0, it simplifies to:\r
□𝑛\r

2\r
𝑓\r
\u0011 \f\r
\f\r
\f\r
(𝜁 )\r
2=0\r
= 2𝑛 𝑓 + 4𝜁 · 𝜕 𝑓 .\r
Now, if 𝑓 = 𝝓 is homogeneous of degree 𝑑 − 2, then 𝜁 · 𝜕𝝓 = (𝑑 − 2)𝝓, and thus:\r
□𝑛\r
\u0010\r

=\r
\r
2𝑛 + 4(𝑑 − 2)\r

In 𝑛 = 6 dimensions, this vanishes only when 𝑑 = −1.\r
3\r
In Ref. [49], the metric signature is chosen to be mostly negative, in contrast to the convention\r
adopted in this manuscript. As a result, certain terms in the corresponding two-point function differ\r
from ours by a sign.

Glossary\r
Glossary of Clifford and Lie algebras used in the monograph, with precise nesting\r
and isomorphisms:\r
1. 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) is the 64-dimensional real associative Clifford algebra generated by 𝑚𝜇,\r
𝜇 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, as:\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) = spann1, 𝑚𝜇, 𝑚𝜇𝜈 := 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈(𝜇 < 𝜈), 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈 𝑚𝜌(𝜇 < 𝜈 < 𝜌), . . . ,\r
𝐸 := 𝑚0 𝑚5 𝑚1. . . 𝑚4\r
o\r
,\r
(4.51)\r
subject to the Clifford relations:\r
\b\r
𝑚𝜇, 𝑚𝜈\r
\t\r
= 𝑚𝜇𝑚𝜈 + 𝑚𝜈𝑚𝜇 = 2𝜂𝜇𝜈1 , 𝜂𝜇𝜈 = diag(−1, −1, +1, +1, +1, +1) .\r
(4.52)\r
2. The even Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1)\r
\u0001\r
is:\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) = spann1, 𝑚𝜇𝜈 := 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈(𝜇 < 𝜈), 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈 𝑚𝜌 𝑚𝜎 (𝜇 < 𝜈 < 𝜌 < 𝜎),\r
𝐸 := 𝑚0 𝑚5 𝑚1. . . 𝑚4\r
o\r
,\r
(4.53)\r
i.e., the 32-dimensional real subalgebra spanned by all products of an even\r
number of the generators 𝑚𝜇.\r
3. The bivectors 𝑚𝜇𝜈 are closed under commutator and provide a spinorial real\u0002ization of the conformal Lie algebra:\r
𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
= spann𝑚𝜇𝜈 := 𝑚𝜇 𝑚𝜈\r
o\r
⊂ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) , (4.54)\r
with the Lie bracket given by \u0002𝑚𝜇𝜈, 𝑚𝜌𝜎\u0003computed inside 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2).\r

146 Glossary\r
4. The pseudoscalar 𝐸 := 𝑚0 𝑚5𝑚1. . . 𝑚4 commutates with all bivectors 𝑚𝜇𝜈\r
generating 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
. Hence, 𝐸 spans the central 𝔲(1) in the\r
extended conformal Lie algebra:\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) . (4.55)\r
5. The de Sitter (dS) algebra is realized as the subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
that preserves a fixed “5-direction” in the 6-dimensional space. Specifically:\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 1)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔭(2, 2)\r
\u0001\r
= spann𝑚𝛼𝛽 := 𝑚𝛼𝑚𝛽; 𝛼, 𝛽 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\r
o\r
⊂ 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) , (4.56)\r
with commutator taken inside 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2). These bivectors 𝑚𝛼𝛽 satisfy the\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 1) Lie algebra relations and provide a spinorial realization of the cor\u0002responding dS group Spin(4, 1) \u001B Sp(2, 2).

This monograph is dedicated to the memory\r
of Professor Ivan Todorov (1933-2025),\r
whose profound contributions to theoretical\r
and mathematical physics and invaluable\r
guidance were instrumental in shaping this\r
research. We deeply regret his passing on\r
February 14, 2025, during the preparation of\r
this work. Grounded in his insights and notes,\r
this study reflects his enduring impact on the\r
field. His legacy will continue to inspire\r
generations of physicists and mathematicians.

Preface\r
At the dawn of our Universe, during the inflationary epoch, spacetime underwent a\r
brief but dramatic burst of quasi-exponential expansion. In this extreme regime, all\r
quantum fields were effectively massless, and their dynamics were dictated by the\r
intertwined structures of de Sitter (dS) and conformal symmetries. These symmetries\r
constrained the primordial quantum fluctuations, which ultimately seeded the large\u0002scale structure of the cosmos we observe today. Understanding the mathematical\r
fabric of these massless (conformal) fields is therefore central not only to fundamental\r
physics but also to modern cosmology, shedding light on the quantum origin of\r
cosmic structures and the near-scale invariance of primordial perturbations.\r
“...as time goes on, it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician\r
finds interesting are the same as those which Nature has chosen.”\r
— Paul Dirac (1939)\r
This profound insight from Paul Dirac perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this\r
volume, which explores the elegant mathematical structures underlying massless\r
elementary systems — “free” fields or particles — in dS spacetime. dS spacetime, the\r
maximally symmetric solution of Einstein’s equations with a positive cosmological\r
constant Λ, is a manifold of constant positive curvature that models an exponentially\r
expanding Universe and closely approximates the large-scale geometry of our present\r
cosmos.\r
This volume is part of a broader research program dedicated to developing a\r
mathematically rigorous, representation-theoretic framework for elementary systems\r
in dS spacetime. In line with Wigner’s fundamental principle — that quantum\r
elementary systems correspond to unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of\r
the underlying spacetime symmetry group — quantum elementary systems in dS\r
spacetime are identified with (projective) UIRs of the dS relativity group SO0 (4, 1)\r
or its universal covering group Sp(2, 2) \u001B Spin(4, 1). Wigner originally formulated\r
this classification within the flat Minkowski setting, where rest mass 𝑚 and spin 𝑠\r
of a system serve as the fundamental invariants labeling the corresponding UIR of\r
the Poincaré group ISL(2, C) — the relativity group of flat Minkowski spacetime.\r
Introducing a constant curvature into spacetime is the sole mechanism by which\r

viii Preface\r
Poincaré symmetry is deformed, giving rise to the dS and anti-dS symmetry groups;\r
in this curved context, the notion of mass is replaced by a curvature-dependent\r
energy parameter, while spin remains a discrete invariant.\r
Within this robust representation-theoretic framework, and building on concepts\r
developed in the earlier volume, The de Sitter (dS) group and its representations\r
(2nd ed., Springer, Cham, Switzerland, 2024), this work delves more deeply into\r
the mathematical structures underlying dS massless elementary systems. Fully self\u0002contained, it places particular emphasis on the interplay between massless conformal\r
representations and their restrictions to dS spacetime, with Clifford algebras serving\r
as a unifying algebraic framework throughout.\r
Beyond Wigner’s foundational framework, it has long been recognized that the\r
massless nature of elementary systems is intimately tied to deeper symmetry prin\u0002ciples — most notably, conformal symmetry. At the heart of this symmetry lies\r
the conformal group U(2, 2) — the U(1)-extended form of SU(2, 2) \u001B SO(4, 2)\r
— whose unitary representations encompass a rich variety of elementary systems.\r
Among these, the massless representations, commonly called ladder representa\u0002tions, form a distinguished subclass, ideally suited for describing physically relevant\r
massless systems. First studied by Mack and Todorov in the late 1960s, these rep\u0002resentations exhibit the striking property of remaining irreducible when restricted\r
to the quantum-mechanical Poincaré subgroup ISL(2, C). In this limit, they yield\r
the well-known Poincaré massless representations, characterized by vanishing rest\r
mass and quantized helicity. These representations form the natural framework for\r
describing lightlike — or massless — elementary systems in Minkowski spacetime\r
and serve as a conceptual springboard for investigating their counterparts in more\r
general geometric settings.\r
This volume undertakes a detailed study of the restriction of massless (ladder)\r
conformal representations to dS spacetime. Specifically, it considers the embedding\r
of SO0 (4, 1) into the conformal group U(2, 2) via its universal covering Sp(2, 2).\r
Within this framework, we analyze the restriction of conformal ladder representa\u0002tions to dS symmetry, emphasizing the persistence of their irreducibility and its\r
implications for the structure of massless fields in curved geometries.\r
A defining feature of this work, which sets it apart from earlier studies, is the\r
use of Clifford algebras — specifically 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) — as the primary framework, rather\r
than U(2, 2) directly. Through a Clifford-split-octonion construction, 8-component\r
Majorana spinors are realized explicitly in a geometrically enriched form. Conceptu\u0002ally, this embeds spinorial degrees of freedom within an 8-dimensional composition\r
algebra governed by alternativity (via the Moufang identities). Left-multiplication\r
by split-octonion units yields coherent operators realizing the Majorana gamma ma\u0002trices, fusing algebraic, spinorial, and geometric structures, and exposing a deep link\r
between spinor geometry and the underlying composition-algebraic structure.\r
Within this framework, the conformal Lie algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) emerges\r
naturally from the commutators of bivectors in the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 1), while the Clifford pseudoscalar generates the central 𝔲(1), producing the\r
full conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1). This construction provides\r
direct access to the full conformal group U(2, 2) entirely within the Clifford alge-

bra, with exponentials of the Lie algebra elements — which generate the group —\r
admitting finite-series representations intrinsic to the Clifford framework. Likewise,\r
the formalism accommodates the dS Lie algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) and its universal covering\r
group Sp(2, 2), so that all fundamental Lie group-theoretic operations — expo\u0002nentiation, inversion, multiplication, and spinorial action — are performed entirely\r
within the Clifford framework, making computations both explicit and conceptually\r
transparent. Moreover, the split-octonion realization unifies spinorial and tensorial\r
representations, allowing the explicit construction of ladder operators, Casimir in\u0002variants, and invariant bilinear forms for massless fields of arbitrary helicity.\r
In short, by situating the spinors within the rich architecture of split-octonions,\r
the framework uncovers deep and previously hidden correspondences between\r
dS/conformal symmetries and alternative and exceptional algebraic structures, sug\u0002gesting a conceptual unity underlying the organization of massless fields in curved\r
spacetime.\r
The methods developed here are designed to be both rigorous and accessi\u0002ble. Graduate students are guided step by step through the algebraic, geometric,\r
and representation-theoretic tools, while advanced researchers are provided with\r
concrete techniques and fresh perspectives for explicit computations and theoreti\u0002cal explorations. By integrating spinorial, tensorial, and group-theoretic structures\r
within a single algebraic setting, the monograph bridges multiple domains — from\r
higher-spin physics, conformal geometry, and quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\r
spacetimes, to string theory, holography, and cosmological modeling.\r
In this way, the work serves simultaneously as a pedagogical guide, a techni\u0002cal reference, and a conceptual resource. It clarifies how symmetry, curvature, and\r
algebraic structure converge in the theory of massless fields, and it highlights the\r
conceptual role of the split-octonion realization as a unifying structure that connects\r
spinorial geometry, algebraic formalism, and the representation theory of mass\u0002less conformal systems, pointing toward new directions for both mathematical and\r
physical research.\r

An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary\r
Systems and Wigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS)\r
Geometry\r
Abstract This chapter sets the stage for the monograph by outlining its central\r
motivations, thematic scope, and methodological framework. It places the study of\r
conformal massless elementary systems — “free” fields or particles — within both a\r
historical and conceptual context, tracing the influence of Ivan Todorov’s pioneering\r
work and the enduring significance of Wigner’s principles for the classification of\r
elementary systems. By emphasizing the interplay between representation theory,\r
conformal invariance, and the geometry of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, the chapter\r
provides a conceptual roadmap for analyzing massless elementary systems in cos\u0002mologically significant settings. It also establishes key conventions and notational\r
standards, ensuring consistency throughout the text. Serving as both an introduc\u0002tion and a conceptual guide, this chapter prepares readers for the deeper algebraic,\r
geometric, and physical developments in the subsequent chapters."""

Legacy of Ivan Todorov\r
Conformal symmetry — the invariance of physical systems under transformations\r
that preserve angles while not necessarily preserving distances — has occupied a\r
foundational role in the development of theoretical physics. Its conceptual origins\r
trace back to the early twentieth century, when mathematicians and physicists be\u0002gan the systematic study of transformations preserving local geometric structures,\r
thereby establishing the algebraic and geometric groundwork for modern symmetry\r
principles in both quantum field theory (QFT) and relativity. The recognition that\r
geometry can enforce structural constraints on physical laws elevated symmetry to\r
the status of a unifying paradigm across diverse domains of physics.\r
In the 1930s, Cartan’s pioneering work [1] on differential geometry provided a\r
rigorous framework for analyzing symmetries on curved manifolds, introducing con\u0002cepts such as torsion, curvature, and moving frames. While Cartan did not explicitly\r
formulate conformal symmetry in physics, his formalism later supplied essential ge\u00021

21 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
ometric and algebraic machinery for its systematic study. Concurrently, Weyl’s 1918\r
proposal [2] of scale invariance, further developed during the 1920s and 1930s, high\u0002lighted the profound interplay between geometry and physical law, foreshadowing\r
the systematic consideration of local angle-preserving and scale transformations in\r
theoretical physics.\r
By the 1950s and early 1960s, the mathematical study of unitary representations\r
of Lie groups, particularly the Poincaré group, had been advanced through the foun\u0002dational work of Wigner, who classified elementary particles as unitary irreducible\r
representations (UIRs) of spacetime symmetries [3], and by Newton and Wigner’s\r
analysis of relativistic localization [4]. Further progress was made by V. Bargmann in\r
his classification of Lorentz group representations [5], and by Gel’fand and Naimark\r
in their systematic treatment of representations of classical groups [6]. Building on\r
these foundations, mathematicians such as Segal [7] and Mackey [8] developed the\r
theory of induced representations and harmonic analysis on groups, while Harish\u0002Chandra [9] established the general representation theory of semisimple Lie groups.\r
These developments clarified the classification of massive and Poincaré massless\r
representations — including helicity states and the more exotic continuous-spin\r
cases — and provided representation-theoretic tools that were later extended to\r
larger symmetry groups, notably the conformal group, as in the rigorous treatment\r
by Gel’fand, Minlos, and Shapiro [10] and later in the field-theoretic constructions\r
of Mack and Salam [11].\r
Building on algebraic and representation-theoretic foundations, Fronsdal’s sem\u0002inal 1978 work [12] provided a systematic formulation of free massless higher\u0002spin fields in a Poincaré-invariant framework. His construction introduced the now\u0002standard gauge-invariant Fronsdal equations, giving consistent field equations for\r
totally symmetric particles of arbitrary spin. Although originally formulated in flat\r
spacetime, this framework laid the foundation for later developments that extended\r
higher-spin fields to (anti-)dS backgrounds and to conformal higher-spin theories.\r
These advances were part of a broader trend in the 1970s and 1980s in which con\u0002formal symmetry emerged as a unifying principle across diverse areas of theoretical\r
physics, including conformal field theory (CFT), string theory, the study of critical\r
phenomena in statistical mechanics, and higher-spin gauge theories.\r
As this conceptual and algebraic framework took shape, the late 1960s marked a\r
pivotal phase in the study of conformal symmetry, featuring one of the first systematic\r
investigations of massless representations and the introduction of ladder represen\u0002tations of the conformal group [13]. Spearheaded by the landmark collaboration\r
between Gerhard Mack and Ivan Todorov, this program demonstrated how Poincaré\r
massless representations could be consistently extended to the conformal group.\r
The resulting algebraic framework provided a mathematically rigorous characteriza\u0002tion of massless elementary systems and established a bridge between conventional\r
flat-space QFT and its conformally extended formulations. This formalism subse\u0002quently became foundational for the precise treatment of massless quantum fields in\r
both Minkowski and curved spacetimes, underpinning later developments in CFT,\r
higher-spin theories, and the study of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics."""

Curvature-Induced Deformations\r
In modern theories of elementary systems — whether field-theoretic or phenomeno\u0002logical — their formulation, and in particular their interpretation, fundamentally rely\r
on the concepts of energy, momentum, mass, and spin, which emerge from invari\u0002ance under the Poincaré group, the relativity group of flat Minkowski spacetime. It\r
is, however, widely acknowledged that such theories cannot ultimately rest solely\r
on this symmetry. A fully consistent framework must respect the broader principle\r
of general covariance, reflecting Einstein’s vision of spacetime as a Riemannian\r
manifold.\r
Beyond the familiar flat Minkowski setting, the absence of nontrivial motion\r
groups in generic curved backgrounds makes the direct extension of these funda\u0002mental notions highly nontrivial, if not impossible. In this context, the common\r
suggestion to merely generalize fundamental equations — such as the Klein-Gordon\r
or Dirac equations — to fully covariant forms misses the deeper issue; it addresses\r
only the formal structure, not the conceptual foundation. Indeed, modern theories of\r
elementary systems are not primarily concerned with differential equations per se,\r
but with the deeper symmetry principles that underlie them.\r
This is precisely where Wigner’s principle — particularly, its remarkable continu\u0002ity under curvature-induced deformations — proves essential, providing a robust and\r
conceptually coherent framework for extending the classification and understanding\r
of elementary systems from flat Minkowski spacetime to curved dS and anti-dS\r
spacetimes."""

In the field-theoretic formulation of elementary systems, the foundational works of\r
Eugene Wigner [3, 4] established that the principles of special relativity impose\r
symmetry requirements on the laws of nature — most notably, invariance under the\r
Poincaré group in flat Minkowski spacetime.\r
Within the flat Minkowski framework, quantum elementary systems are identi\u0002fied with (projective) UIRs of the Poincaré group (or one of its coverings) [3, 4].\r
Each such representation is uniquely characterized by two invariant quantities: the

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations5\r
rest mass 𝑚 and the spin 𝑠 of the system. These invariants not only encode the\r
system’s fundamental physical properties but also reflect the symmetry structure of\r
the underlying Minkowski spacetime.\r
Remarkably, introducing a constant curvature into spacetime yields the unique\r
natural and continuous deformation of Poincaré symmetry group. This deformation\r
gives rise to the dS and anti-dS groups of motion. The corresponding dS and anti\u0002dS spacetimes [21, 22] — maximally symmetric solutions of Einstein’s equations\r
with, respectively, positive and negative cosmological constant Λ — thereby acquire\r
a privileged status as the only curved backgrounds in which Wigner’s symmetry\u0002based definition of elementary systems admits a meaningful generalization. In these\r
settings, elementary systems are once again described by UIRs of the relevant space\u0002time symmetry groups. As in the flat case, these representations are classified by two\r
invariants — the spin and a characteristic mass or energy scale — thus preserving\r
the core structural features of Wigner’s original framework.\r

the dS and AdS groups can be regarded as deformations of the Poincaré group. The conformal\r
group provides a unifying framework encompassing all three.

Beyond Wigner’s foundational framework, it has long been established that the\r
massless nature of elementary systems is intimately connected to deeper symmetry\r
principles — most notably, conformal symmetry [12, 13, 23, 24, 25]. This symmetry\r
is not merely auxiliary structures but constitutes intrinsic aspects of massless field\r
dynamics, manifesting both at the level of representation theory and in the behavior\r
of field equations under spacetime transformations.\r
In the flat Minkowski setting, massless elementary systems correspond to UIRs of\r
the Poincaré group with vanishing mass and discrete helicity — commonly referred\r
to as Poincaré massless representations. A result of fundamental significance, due to\r
Mack and Todorov [13, 25], establishes that each such representation admits a unique\r
extension to a UIR of the conformal group SU(2, 2) \u001B SO(4, 2), or more generally\r
its U(1)-extended form U(2, 2); these conformal UIRs are commonly called ladder\r
representations. This framework furnishes a canonical and rigorous link between\r
masslessness and conformal symmetry, so that any quantum system realizing a\r
Poincaré massless representation necessarily carries a well-defined conformal action.\r
A parallel and equally deep structure is present in constant-curvature spacetimes.\r
In dS and anti-dS geometries, the natural analogues of Poincaré massless represen\u0002tations are those UIRs of the respective symmetry groups whose unique conformal\r
extensions are massless (ladder) representations. In representation-theoretic terms,\r
these conformal extensions match the conformal extensions obtained from the mass\u0002less Poincaré side, meaning that:\r
The massless ⇐⇒ conformal correspondence\r
survives passage from flat spacetime to dS and anti-dS backgrounds,\r
the only difference being that in dS the energy sign is undefined,\r
while in anti-dS helicity is ambiguous."""

Structure to Cosmological Dynamics\r
This work focuses on massless (ladder) representations in conformal space, and in\r
particular on their restriction to 3 + 1-dimensional dS spacetime, whose symmetry\r
structure governs both the earliest [26] and asymptotic [27, 28] stages of cosmic evo\u0002lution. During the inflationary epoch (≈ 10−36 to 10−32 seconds after the Big Bang),\r
when the Universe underwent rapid quasi-exponential expansion, the Hubble scale\r
vastly exceeded all intrinsic mass scales, rendering all elementary systems effectively\r
massless. In this regime, dS symmetry together with conformal symmetry provides\r
the natural framework for their consistent description. Inflationary (massless) ele\u0002mentary systems are realized through ladder representations of the conformal group\r
U(2, 2), which, upon restriction to the dS subgroup Sp(2, 2), rigorously encode the

1.2 Wigner’s (Massless) Elementary Systems: Continuity under Curvature-Induced Deformations7\r
quantum degrees of freedom of these fields. This representation-theoretic structure\r
underlies the near-scale invariance of primordial fluctuations that seeded cosmic\r
structure and, more generally, furnishes a canonical, symmetry-based classification\r
of inflationary quantum states via UIRs.\r
Moreover, at late times, observations of distant Type Ia supernovae [27, 28]\r
reveal that the Universe is accelerating, a phenomenon attributed to “dark energy”.\r
A small, positive cosmological constant Λ naturally models this acceleration, making\r
dS geometry both the vacuum state and the asymptotic attractor of the Universe.\r
Accordingly, dS spacetime remains a central arena for QFT in curved back\u0002grounds, offering deep insights at the interface of quantum physics, gravity, and\r
cosmology. Across both early- and late-time cosmology, massless systems gov\u0002erned by conformal symmetry form a unifying thread. Ladder representations of\r
U(2, 2) provide a coherent and mathematically precise description of massless field\r
dynamics, encompassing both the inflationary quantum fluctuations that seeded cos\u0002mic structure and the behavior of fields in the late-time accelerated Universe. This\r
representation-theoretic framework thus directly links quantum symmetries to ob\u0002servable cosmological phenomena, highlighting their continuous and fundamental\r
role throughout cosmic evolution."""

Motivated by the considerations described above, this monograph forms part of a\r
broader program (see Ref. [29] and references therein) to develop a mathematically\r
rigorous, representation-theoretic account of elementary systems in dS spacetime\r
grounded in Wigner’s principle. The present work concentrates on the conceptually\r
rich realm of massless elementary systems in dS spacetime and their intimate re\u0002lation to conformal symmetry. Although the embedding SO0 (4, 1) ↩→ U(2, 2) (via\r
the covering Sp(2, 2)) is well known, the representation-theoretic and physical con\u0002sequences of this embedding — particularly for massless (ladder) representations —\r
deserve a focused, algebraically explicit treatment.\r
Rather than remaining solely within an abstract group framework based on U(2, 2)\r
(as already studied in Ref. [13]), this study adopts the conformal Clifford algebra\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) as the primary algebraic language. Far beyond a mere change of notation,\r
the Clifford framework provides concrete spinorial and geometric tools, sharpening\r
both conceptual understanding and practical computations. Concretely, we construct\r
an explicit real-matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) on 8-component Majorana spinors\r
via an embedding rooted in the alternative composition split-octonion algebra.\r
Interpreting the 8 split-octonion units as left-regular multiplication operators on\r
the split-octonion space produces an algebra of linear endomorphisms naturally\r
realized as 8 × 8 real matrices. By virtue of alternativity — encapsulated by the\r
Moufang identities — left multiplication by a suitably chosen set of 6 of the 8 split\u0002octonion units yields a coherent and internally consistent system of operators which\r
furnishes a realization of the 8-component Majorana gamma matrices associated with

81 An Overview of Conformal Massless Elementary Systems andWigner’s Vision in de Sitter (dS) Geometry\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2). Since composition of endomorphisms is strictly associative, the Clifford\r
relations are faithfully reproduced in this setting, and one thereby obtains a canonical\r
associative matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The resulting embedding, however, is\r
not an algebra homomorphism in the strict sense; in general, 𝐿𝐴𝐵 ≠ 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵, reflecting\r
the intrinsic nonassociativity of the underlying octonionic product.\r
This is indeed a deliberate, conceptual choice. The alternative split-octonionic\r
embedding preserves the intrinsic multiplicative relations of the composition alge\u0002bra while furnishing a geometrically natural — and strikingly economical — route\r
to the real gamma matrices and spinor multiplications employed throughout this\r
work. More than a mere calculational convenience, the construction unifies alge\u0002braic, spinorial, and geometric structures into a single framework, directly tying the\r
spinorial degrees of freedom to the deeper architecture of the composition algebra.\r
This split-octonionic realization also furnishes a unified framework in which\r
both the conformal and dS Lie algebras, together with their groups, are embedded\r
explicitly within 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The conformal algebra 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) arises from\r
commutators of bivectors in the even subalgebra 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1), and the\r
Clifford pseudoscalar generates the central 𝔲(1), yielding the full conformal Lie\r
algebra 𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) ⊕ 𝔲(1). On the other hand, exponentiating these gener\u0002ators produces invertible group elements of U(2, 2). Similarly, the dS Lie algebra\r
𝔰𝔬(4, 1) appears as a subalgebra whose exponentials generate elements of Sp(2, 2).\r
Since the exponential power series converges within the finite-dimensional Clifford\r
algebra and, for bivectors, reduces to closed ‘cos/sin’ or ‘cosh/sinh’ forms, every\r
group operation — including multiplication, inversion, and action on spinors —\r
occurs entirely within the Clifford framework. This structure provides an explicit,\r
efficient, and fully representation-theoretic platform for computing invariant bilinear\r
forms, ladder operators, spectra, and other quantities, keeping both conformal and\r
dS symmetries manifest and fully intertwined, with the conformal structure realized\r
in a way that is simultaneously algebraic and spinorial. Moreover, 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) naturally\r
accommodates both spinorial and tensorial representations, so the same algebraic\r
machinery describes fields of arbitrary helicity. This unification simplifies the con\u0002struction of ladder representations and the explicit realization of their restrictions to\r
dS symmetry.\r
In short, by grounding the spinorial construction in the rich structure of split\u0002octonions, the framework furnishes a unified, explicit, and computationally power\u0002ful toolbox for the study of massless conformal systems. At the same time, it points\r
toward deeper algebraic connections — notably to alternative and exceptional struc\u0002tures — that may underlie the organization of massless fields in curved spacetime.\r

Majorana Representation of the Conformal\r
Clifford Algebra 𝖈𝖑(4, 2) and its Chiral\r
Counterpart\r
Abstract This chapter presents an explicit Majorana representation of the conformal\r
Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) on 8-component real spinors, drawing on the rich algebraic\r
structure of the split-octonions — an 8-dimensional composition algebra constructed\r
via the Cayley-Dickson process. The discussion begins with a clear and systematic\r
overview of the number systems, which naturally leads to the octonions; complex\r
numbers and quaternions. Particular emphasis is placed on the Moufang identities,\r
which capture alternativity, a relaxed form of associativity that remains fully com\u0002patible with spinor calculus. In the split-octonion setting, alternativity coexists with\r
nonassociativity, creating a subtle but well-controlled framework in which spinorial\r
multiplications retain internal coherence. By exploiting left multiplication by a suit\u0002ably chosen set of 6 of the 7 imaginary split-octonion units, the chapter develops\r
a real-matrix representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) that is both geometrically transparent and\r
ideally suited to the Majorana formalism. This construction provides a unified al\u0002gebraic framework for the internal symmetries of the conformal Lie algebra 𝔲(2, 2)\r
and naturally realizes the embedding chain:\r
𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r
\u0001\r
⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) ,\r
where the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) pseudoscalar (volume form) generates the 𝔲(1) center of 𝔲(2, 2).\r
Building on this foundation, the chapter investigates the complex structure in\u0002herent in 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its action on spinor space, using the simpler 𝔠𝔩(2) case as an\r
instructive prototype. We emphasize that the Majorana (real) basis and the chiral\r
basis are merely two alternative bases of the same real Clifford algebra; no complex\u0002ification is required. Exploiting this insight, a unitary transformation is constructed\r
that maps the real-matrix basis of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) to the chiral basis, in which the Cartan\r
elements of the maximal compact subalgebra of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2), together with the 𝔲(1)\r
generator defined by the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) volume form, assume a diagonal form. These re\u0002sults furnish a coherent, geometrically grounded framework for the study of massless\r
conformal systems, applicable in flat Minkowski spacetime as well as in curved de\r
Sitter (dS) and anti-dS spacetimes.\r

Remark 2.2 Analogous to the identities given in Eq. (2.41)-(2.45), any pairs of\r
different imaginary split-octonion units generate an 8-dimensional associative group:"""

number = "1"

\b\r
± 𝚤, ± 𝚥, ±𝒌, ±1\r
\t\r
, (2.48)\r
which is associative by construction. For example:\r
𝚤( 𝚥 𝒌) = (𝚤 𝚥)𝒌 . (2.49)\r
2. Any other pair of distinct imaginary units likewise generates an associative sub\u0002algebra of split-octonions. For instance, the pair (𝚤, 𝚥ℓ) generates the subalgebra:

28 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
\b\r
± 𝚤, ± 𝚥ℓ, ±ℓ𝒌, ±1\r
\t\r
, (2.50)\r
which is again associative. For instance:\r
𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥ℓ) (ℓ𝒌)\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
𝚤( 𝚥ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
(ℓ𝒌) . (2.51)\r
Note: Three imaginary units are said to be independent if they do not belong to an\r
associative subalgebra of the Moufang loop of OS units. For example, the aforemen\u0002tioned three basic elements 𝚤, 𝚥, and ℓ are independent as:\r
\r
(𝚤) ( 𝚥)\r
\u0001\r
ℓ ≠ 𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥) (ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
. (2.52)\r
□\r
Remark 2.3 As an extension of Moufang’s theorem (see Ref. [98]), the loop gener\u0002ated by any three independent elements — for example, 𝚤, 𝚥, and ℓ — indeed forms a\r
“modified” associative finite subalgebra. The corresponding “modified” associative\r
law differs from the standard one by an overall sign, which encodes the nonassocia\u0002tive (in the usual sense) character of the three independent units. For instance, the\r
nonequality in Eq. (2.52) explicitly reads:\r
\r
(𝚤) ( 𝚥)\r
\u0001\r
ℓ = −𝚤\r
\r
( 𝚥) (ℓ)\r
\u0001\r
. (2.53)\r
Thus, for any triple of independent (and therefore nonassociative) imaginary split\u0002octonion units, Moufang’s theorem guarantees that seemingly nonintuitive identities\r
can be derived systematically via the “modified” associative law. As a further illus\u0002trative case, let us examine the independent generators ℓ, 𝒌, and 𝚤:\r
\r
(ℓ) (𝒌)\r
\u0001\r
𝚤 = −ℓ\r
\r
(𝒌) (𝚤)\r
\u0001\r
| {z }\r
by “modified” associative law\r
= −ℓ 𝚥 = 𝚥ℓ , (2.54)\r
which is fully consistent with the multiplication table in (2.47).\r
Summary: Any triple of imaginary split-octonion units is either nonindependent,\r
and therefore fully associative, or independent, and thus “modified” associative,\r
with the modification differing from standard associativity by an overall sign. This\r
precisely expresses the principle of alternativity that characterizes the split-octonion\r
algebra. □\r
Proposition 2.1 As a direct consequence of the preceding Remarks, for all 𝒎, 𝒏 ∈\r
OS\\{1} and 𝑜 ∈ OS, one has:\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) =\r
\r
\r
\r
−𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) for 𝒎 ≠ 𝒏\r
𝒎2 𝑜 for 𝒎 = 𝒏\r
. (2.55)\r
Proof — Step I (first case, with nonindependent (associative) units). If 𝒎, 𝒏, 𝑜\r
(with 𝒎 ≠ 𝒏) belong to a nonindependent subalgebra, we have:

2.2 Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) Generated by Left Multiplication of Imaginary Split-Octonion Units29\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) = (𝒎 𝒏) 𝑜 (by standard associative law)\r
= (−𝒏 𝒎) 𝑜 (by anticommutativity of imaginary units)\r
= −𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) (again, by standard associative law) . (2.56)\r
— Step II (first case, with independent (nonassociative) units). If 𝒎, 𝒏, 𝑜 (with\r
𝒎 ≠ 𝒏) form an independent triple, invoking the “modified” associative law from\r
Remark 2.3, we get:\r
𝒎(𝒏 𝑜) = −(𝒎 𝒏) 𝑜 (by “modified” associative law)\r
= −(−𝒏 𝒎) 𝑜 (by anticommutativity of imaginary units)\r
= −𝒏(𝒎 𝑜) (again, by “modified” associative law) . (2.57)\r
— Step III (second case). When 𝒎 = 𝒏, the result follows immediately from\r
alternativity. Indeed, any pair of split-octonion units generates an associative subal\u0002gebra — a direct consequence of Remark 2.2. Therefore:\r
𝒎(𝒎 𝑜) = (𝒎 𝒎) 𝑜 = 𝒎\r
2\r
𝑜 . (2.58)\r
This identity generalizes straightforwardly to repeated multiplications:\r
𝒎\r

𝑜)\r
\u0001\r
. . . \u0011= 𝒎\r
𝑟\r
𝑜 . (2.59)\r
As a direct consequence (setting 𝑜 = 1), powers of a single split-octonion unit are\r
fully associative and therefore well-defined, ensuring that all such repeated products\r
are unambiguous.\r
From the preceding results, it follows that Eq. (2.55) is valid. □"""

\t\r
o\r
. (2.61)\r
2. On the left-hand side of (2.60), by contrast, 𝐴 solely plays the role of an index\r
labelling the associated 8 × 8 matrix operator 𝐿𝐴; no octonionic interpreta\u0002tion is attached to 𝐴 in this position. Correspondingly, 𝑥 is interpreted as an\r
8-component Dirac-Majorana spinor, obtained by identifying OS \u001B R\r
8 with re\u0002spect to the basis above. Each 𝐿𝐴 acts linearly on this spinor space. Accordingly,\r
the operators 𝐿𝐴 can be enumerated as:\r
𝐿𝐴 = 𝐿1, 𝐿𝒌 , 𝐿𝜈, with 𝜈 ∈\r
n\r
0 := 𝚤, 5 := 𝚥, 1 := ℓ𝚤, 2 := 𝚥ℓ, 3 := ℓ𝒌, 4 := ℓ\r
o\r
.\r
(2.62)\r
Remark 2.4 We emphasize that the map 𝐴 ↦−→ 𝐿𝐴 is not an algebra homomor\u0002phism. While the product 𝐴 ⋄ 𝐵 := 𝐴𝐵, with 𝐴, 𝐵 = 1, 𝒌, 𝜈 ∈ {𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ},\r
is nonassociative (more precisely, alternative), the matrix product 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 is associa\u0002tive.\r
In fact, all nested products of operators 𝐿𝐴 are interpreted as successive left\r
multiplications on 𝑥 ∈ Span{𝐴}. This convention ensures that, despite the intrinsic\r
nonassociativity of the split-octonions, expressions of the form:\r
𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶 𝑥 = (𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵) (𝐿𝐶 𝑥)\r
= (𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶) 𝑥\r
= 𝐿𝐴(𝐿𝐵𝐿𝐶) 𝑥\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
= 𝐿𝐴\r
\r
𝐿𝐵(𝐿𝐶 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝐴\r
\r
𝐵(𝐶 𝑥)\r
\u0001\r
(2.63)\r
are fully unambiguous and well-defined. Of course, for brevity, parentheses may oc\u0002casionally be omitted in such expressions, although their presence is always implied\r
by definition.\r
Consequently, we have 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 ≠ 𝐿𝐴𝐵, since 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 𝑥 = 𝐴(𝐵 𝑥) while 𝐿𝐴𝐵 𝑥 =\r
(𝐴𝐵) 𝑥. Nevertheless, in the sequel, we adopt the convenient notation 𝐿𝐴𝐿𝐵 =: 𝐿𝐴𝐵,\r
which is always understood to mean 𝐿𝐴𝐵 𝑥 = 𝐴(𝐵 𝑥). □\r
Let us now denote 6 of the 8 operators 𝐿𝐴, when 𝐴 = 𝜈 = 𝚤, 𝚥, ℓ𝚤, 𝚥ℓ, ℓ𝒌 , ℓ or\r
simply 𝐴 = 𝜈 = 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, by 𝑚𝜈:= 𝐿𝜈. By construction, the set of elements 𝑚𝜈\r
generates the conformal Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) — more precisely, its embedding\r
into the alternative-split-octonion algebra. Specifically, these elements satisfy the\r
following anticommutation relations:

result, the eigenspaces 𝔖± of 𝐸, respectively with eigenvalues ±i (to be shown\r
explicitly later), are separately invariant under 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). We will see that each 𝔖± in\r
fact carries an irreducible 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) representation.\r
On the other hand, because 𝐸 itself also generates the central 𝔲(1) factor in 𝔲(2, 2)\r

Then, 𝜔(2) naturally plays the role of the “chirality operator”, distinguishing the\r
right- from the left-handed spinor components.\r
The reality of the Majorana spinor 𝜉 is encapsulated in the requirement that any\r
unitary transformation, 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉, preserves its invariance under charge conjugation\r
— denoted by the superscript ‘𝑐’ — so that the charge conjugate of the transformed\r

𝑐 = 𝜓. By definition, the charge conjugate of a spinor\r
is given by:\r
𝜓\r
𝑐\r
:= 𝐶 𝜓 , (2.111)\r
where the charge conjugation matrix 𝐶 naturally swaps 𝜓\r
+\r

−\r
, preserving the\r
chirality structure. To ensure consistency, 𝐶 must satisfy the following condition:\r
𝐶 𝜎𝜈¤ = 𝜎𝜈¤ 𝐶 , 𝜈¤ = 1, 2 . (2.112)\r
The former identity implies that𝐶 should commute with the real𝔠𝔩(2) generators and\r
anticommute with the imaginary ones. We notice that the matrix 𝐶 = 𝜚\r

satisfies\r
this condition for any choice of the phase factor 𝜚\r

2.3 Diagonalizing the Complex Structure of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) in Spinor Space: Insight from the 𝔠𝔩(2) Case41\r
On the other hand, as previously mentioned, the reality condition of the Majorana\r
spinor 𝜉 ensures that under any unitary transformation 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉, we have:\r
𝜓\r
𝑐\r
\r

𝐶𝑉\r
\u0010\r
𝑉\r
−1\r
\u0011⊤\r
𝜓 = 𝑉 𝐶 𝜓 . (2.115)\r
Since this must hold for all 𝜓, the corresponding transformation law for the charge\r
conjugation matrix follows:\r
𝐶𝑉 = 𝑉 𝐶 𝑉⊤. (2.116)\r
In the original (Majorana or real) basis 𝜉, however, the charge conjugation matrix\r
𝐶 is simply the identity matrix, so that:\r
𝜉\r
𝑐 = 𝜉 . (2.117)\r
We then apply the transformation law (2.116) for the charge conjugation matrix to\r
determine 𝐶𝑉 for 𝜓 = 𝑉𝜉. This yields:\r

Notably, for any 𝜚 ∈ C satisfying 𝜚𝜚 = 1, the matrix 𝑈 = 𝜚𝑉 retains the same\r
intertwining properties as 𝑉 in Eqs. (2.107) and (2.108). Choosing 𝜚 = 𝑒\r

2.4 Unitary Transformation from Real to a Diagonal Compact Cartan Basis of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 432)\r
Let us begin by noting that the product of each pair of the real matrices 𝑚05, 𝑚12,\r

, (2.138)\r
is then 2-dimensional over R (see footnote 4). Indeed, each 2 × 2 block 𝐸𝐴𝐵\r
corresponds to exactly one eigenvalue quadruple and the 2-dimensionality arises\r
because each block is spanned by two independent vectors, for example:\r
𝑣1 =\r

\u0013\r

However, there is no canonical way to distinguish these individual vectors (say 𝑣1\r
and 𝑣2) inside this joint eigenspace using 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and 𝑚34 alone, producing\r
an intrinsic twofold degeneracy.\r
To resolve this degeneracy, one requires an extra operator that acts within each\r
2-dimensional joint eigenspace and distinguishes the two vectors. This operator is\r
indeed the third-order Clifford element 𝐷 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) (see Eq. (2.132)), which satisfies\r
the anticommutation relations (2.133). Since 𝐷 anticommutes with 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, and\r
𝑚34, its action on any vector 𝑣 in a joint eigenspace with eigenvalues 𝜇𝑋 satisfies:\r
𝑋(𝐷𝑣) = −𝐷(𝑋𝑣) = −𝜇𝑋(𝐷𝑣) , for 𝑋 = 𝐸 , 𝑚05 , 𝑚12 , 𝑚34 , (2.140)

462 Majorana Representation of the Conformal Clifford Algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and its Chiral Counterpart\r
where 𝜇𝑋 are the eigenvalues of 𝑣 under 𝑋. Since each joint eigenspace defines a\r
2-dimensional invariant plane under the action of 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, 𝑚34, flipping the signs\r
of all eigenvalues does not move a vector outside this plane. Consequently, 𝐷𝑣 lies\r
in the same 2-dimensional joint eigenspace as 𝑣, but is linearly independent of 𝑣; if\r
𝐷𝑣 were proportional to 𝑣, i.e., 𝐷𝑣 = 𝛼𝑣 for some nonzero scalar 𝛼, then acting with\r
any 𝑋 = 𝐸, 𝑚05, 𝑚12, 𝑚34 would yield 𝜇𝑋 = −𝜇𝑋, forcing 𝜇𝑋 = 0, which does not\r
occur for the nontrivial 2×2 blocks under consideration. Therefore, 𝐷 automatically\r
generates a second independent vector in each joint eigenspace, completely resolving\r
the intrinsic twofold degeneracy. Concretely, 𝐷 acts like a Pauli-𝜎3 operator within\r
each 2 × 2 block, splitting the two states into eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues:\r

Using Eqs. (2.158) and (2.148), together with Proposition 2.1 and the multipli\u0002cation table (2.47) — in a manner analogous to the proof of Proposition 2.2 —\r
one verifies that the transformed versions of the skew-symmetric Cartan matrices\r

and, utilizing the standard properties (2.11) and (2.13) of the trace, that the four 8×8\r

so that every vector has zero norm and all vectors within the same subspace are mu\u0002tually orthogonal. It is important to emphasize that this property holds independently\r

can be easily checked by substituting 𝑦 with any of the zero-norm basis vectors 𝑛𝑎±\r
(in fact, by substituting each one individually). Just to clarify the point, let us set\r
𝑦 = 𝑛\r
05b +\r

which is consistent with Eq. (2.184). In this context, one observes that the chiral\r

Eq. (2.185)).\r

Finally, repeating the analysis for 𝔠𝔩(2) leading to (2.120), we find the phase\r
factor 𝜚 relating 𝑈 and 𝑉 in (2.152) can be again fixed in a way to make the charge\r

quaternionic product in standard (right) order, denoted 𝑅, and one in reversed (left)\r

Ladder Representation of 𝖚(2, 2) as a Quantized\r
4-dimensional Realization\r
Abstract This chapter develops a rigorous framework for positive-energy ladder\r
representations of the conformal Lie algebra:\r

\r
\u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2)\r

⊕ 𝔲(1) ⊂ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) ,\r
realized as quantized models of massless fields with arbitrary helicity in 4-\r
dimensional Minkowski, de Sitter (dS), and anti-dS spacetimes. The construction is\r
founded on an invariant bilinear form in the Majorana-spinor space of𝔠𝔩(4, 2), estab\u0002lishing the geometric basis for the representation theory. Through the isomorphism\r
𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) \u001B 𝔠𝔩(4, 1)\r
\r
⊃ 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
\u0001\r
, an explicit 4 × 4 matrix realization is intro\u0002duced, encoding conformal symmetry in a computationally tractable spinorial form.\r
This provides the foundation for the systematic construction of ladder operators,\r
spectral analysis, and conformally covariant field operators.\r
The representations appear as lowest-weight modules characterized by conformal\r
energy and helicity, giving a full classification of massless conformal fields under\r
𝔲(2, 2). In particular, restriction to the dS subalgebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1) — a central\r
focus of this study — preserves irreducibility, thereby capturing the notion of mass\u0002lessness in this curved background. Embedding these modules into 4-dimensional\r
conformal vertex algebras reveals their analytic structure, including operator product\r
expansions and modular properties. The Casimir invariants are explicitly computed,\r
clarifying their role in the spectrum, while the correspondence between 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and\r
its Euclidean form 𝔰𝔬(5, 1) completes a unified algebraic framework for the study of\r
massless conformal systems in both flat and curved settings."""

along with their chiral realizations, we shall henceforth streamline the notation and\r
present only the resulting formulas.\r
In the preceding chapter, we showed that the 8-dimensional Majorana (real) vector\r
space of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) spinors, spanned by the split-octonion units, naturally carries the\r
structure of a composition algebra — nonassociative but alternative. In particular,\r
it can be equipped with a real-valued trace, a Cayley-Dickson conjugation, a factor\u0002izable quadratic norm 𝑁(𝜉), and an associated nondegenerate symmetric bilinear\r
form ⟨𝜉, 𝜂⟩ such that:\r

Recall that, throughout this work, we employ the simplified index notation 𝜈 ∈\r
\b\r
0 := 𝚤, 5 := 𝚥, 1 := ℓ𝚤, 2 := 𝚥ℓ, 3 := ℓ𝒌, 4 := ℓ\r
\t\r
. This construction yields two\r
inequivalent 8-dimensional spinor representations of Spin(4, 4), arising from left\r
and right multiplication by split-octonion units, together with a third 8-dimensional\r
vector representation. The three are tied together by an invariant trilinear (“Yukawa”)\r
form, which manifests the triality symmetry of the Lie algebra 𝐷4 (see Refs. [102,\r
103], for more details).\r
We now reproduce the inner product (3.2) in the chiral (complex) basis of the\r
generators Γ𝜈 of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The basis generators satisfy the anticommutation relations:\r
\b\r
Γ𝜇, Γ𝜈\r
\t\r

which follow directly from Eq. (2.64). Their behaviour under Hermitian conjugation\r

Recall that 𝜔(4, 2) is the 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) volume form in the basis \bΓ𝜈\r
\t\r
(see Eq. (2.163)),\r
while the bivector generators Γ𝜇𝜈 are defined in Eq. (2.125).\r
Remark 3.1 In the chiral basis of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2), the Clifford generators Γ𝜈are not all anti\u0002Hermitian with respect to ordinary Hermitian conjugation (see Eq. (3.4)); this reflects\r
the mixed Hermiticity properties induced by the Clifford relations in signature (4, 2).\r
As a result, the standard inner product fails to be compatible with the requirement\r
that the generators Γ𝜇𝜈 of the conformal algebra 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) act as anti-Hermitian\r
operators.1Indeed, with respect to the standard inner product:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝜙⟩\r
std = 𝜓\r
∗\r
𝜙 , (3.6)\r
one finds:\r
⟨𝜓, Γ𝜇𝜈𝜙⟩\r
std = 𝜓\r

𝜙 = ⟨Γ\r
∗\r
𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩\r
std = ⟨±Γ𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩std , (3.7)\r
where the sign depends on the specific bivector generator Γ𝜇𝜈 under consideration.\r
Thus, the generators Γ𝜇𝜈 are not uniformly anti-Hermitian with respect to (3.6),\r
obstructing the construction of a unitary representation in the chiral basis.2\r
To remedy this, one introduces a unitary element 𝐵 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) and defines a\r
modified notion of adjoint by imposing Γ\r
∗\r
𝜈 𝐵 = −𝐵 Γ𝜈\r
, and hence Γ\r
∗\r
𝜇𝜈 𝐵 = −𝐵 Γ𝜇𝜈\r
(see Eq. (3.5)). This condition allows one to define a new inner product:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝜙⟩𝐵 = 𝜓\r
∗𝐵 𝜙 , (3.8)\r
1 Let (H , ⟨·, ·⟩ ) be a complex inner product space and let 𝑋 be a linear operator on H . The\r
adjoint 𝑋\r
† of 𝑋 (with respect to ⟨·, ·⟩) is defined by the relation:\r
⟨𝜓, 𝑋𝜙⟩ = ⟨𝑋\r
†𝜓, 𝜙⟩ , for all 𝜓, 𝜙 ∈ H .\r
The operator 𝑋 is said to be Hermitian if 𝑋\r
† = 𝑋 and anti-Hermitian if 𝑋† = −𝑋. These notions\r
depend explicitly on the chosen inner product. In particular, when the inner product is modified, the\r
corresponding adjoint changes accordingly. Only in the special case of the standard inner product\r
does the adjoint 𝑋\r
†\r
coincide with ordinary Hermitian conjugation 𝑋\r
∗\r
:= 𝑋\r
⊤\r
.\r
2 For a unitary representation on a Hilbert space, it is necessary that the generators 𝑋 of the Lie\r
algebra be anti-Hermitian with respect to the chosen inner product, ensuring that their exponentials\r
𝑒\r
𝛼𝑋 (𝛼 ∈ R) are unitary operators and hence that the group representation is unitary.

\u0001∗\r
𝐵 𝜙 = ⟨−Γ𝜇𝜈𝜓, 𝜙⟩𝐵,\r
(3.9)\r
showing explicitly that Γ𝜇𝜈 is anti-Hermitian with respect to (3.8). Consequently,\r
the associated one-parameter subgroups of the conformal group are represented by\r
unitary operators on the Hilbert space, guaranteeing the unitarity of the representa\u0002tion.\r
Finally, requiring that 𝐵 commute with the Clifford volume form 𝜔(4, 2) ensures\r
that the inner product respects the chirality decomposition of the spinor space. In\r
particular, left- and right-handed sectors remain orthogonal, and the action of the\r
bivector generators Γ𝜇𝜈 preserves each chiral sector. In this way, the element 𝐵\r
provides a canonical and algebraically consistent framework for realizing unitary\r
positive-energy irreducible representations (UPEIRs) of the conformal algebra in\r
the chiral Clifford basis.\r
Note: For the sake of notational simplicity, we shall henceforth drop the subscripts\r
‘std’ and ‘𝐵’ from the inner product, as the relevant choice will always be clear from\r
the context. □\r
Remarkably, there exists such a Hermitian unitary 𝐵 ∈ 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) determined by\r
the above properties up to sign. It turns out that the resulting 𝐵 coincides with the\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 0) pseudo scalar:\r
𝐵 = 𝑀(4, 0) = 𝑚12𝑚43 = 𝑈 𝑚12𝑚43 𝑈\r
−1\r

since [𝑚12𝑚43 , 𝑈] = 0\r
= 𝑈 𝑚12 𝑈 𝑈−1𝑚43 𝑈\r
−1 = Γ12Γ43 .\r
(3.10)\r
The commutation relation \u0002𝑚12𝑚43, 𝑈\u0003= 0 can be verified straightforwardly by\r
substituting the explicit form of the unitary transformation 𝑈 from Eq. (2.152),\r
making use of Eqs. (2.96), (2.132), and (2.148), and referring to Proposition 2.1.\r
Then, the Hermitian unitary operator 𝐵 admits a diagonal form both in the Majorana\r

𝔠𝔩(4, 2). The Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) is naturally Z2-graded, meaning it has an\r
even and odd part:\r
𝔠𝔩(4, 2) = 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) ⊕ 𝔠𝔩odd (4, 2) . (3.23)\r

𝔠𝔩odd (4, 2) consists of elements formed from an odd number of generators. The\r
mapping in question explicitly interchanges even and odd elements, sending even\r
elements of 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) to odd elements of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) and vice versa. As a result, it fails\r
to preserve the Z2 grading.\r
3. As a benefit of this 4 × 4 matrix realization of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) \u001B 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2), the 𝔠𝔩(4, 1)\r
is found to have the constant value ‘i’, which corresponds to the eigenvalue of\r

The significance of this result, and in particular the sense in which it constitutes a\r
genuine benefit of the present realization, merits a brief clarification. In general,\r
the Clifford pseudoscalar of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) is central but need not act as a fixed scalar\r
on a spinor module, and its value typically depends on representation-dependent\r
conventions. In the present realization, however, w(4, 1) is identified with the\r
conformal volume element 𝜔(4, 2) restricted to the chiral subspace 𝔖+; since\r
𝜔(4, 2) is a Casimir invariant of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), its action is fixed, yielding w(4, 1) = i1.\r
Thus, the 4 × 4 representation of 𝔠𝔩(4, 1) is automatically irreducible, and its\r
complex structure is canonically inherited from conformal chirality rather than\r
imposed by hand. □\r
We proceed to displaying the 4 × 4-matrix realization of the relevant physical\r
operators of 𝔠𝔩even (4, 2) ⊃ 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) ⊃ 𝔰𝔬(4, 1). To begin with, the 4-dimensional\r

from the following observations:\r

b. The 15 antisymmetric matrices 𝛾𝜇𝜈, obtained by restricting to a fixed chi\u0002ral subspace, are linearly independent and satisfy the 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) Lie algebra\r
commutation relations.\r
Therefore, the image of the representation of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) on either 𝔖+ or 𝔖− is a\r
15-dimensional subalgebra of End(𝔖±). Since the kernel of the map is trivial,\r
the representation is injective, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between\r
the elements of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) and their images in End(𝔖±), and thus confirming the\r
faithfulness of the representation.\r
Note: This key fact will be illustrated explicitly in the realization presented in\r
Eqs. (3.99)-(3.114).\r
Note: If the chiral spinor representation on either 𝔖+ or 𝔖− were not faithful, then\r
distinct elements of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) could act identically on the corresponding subspace.\r
In that case, the bilinears 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑) would generate only a smaller algebra\r
— either the quotient of 𝔰𝔬(4, 2) by the kernel of the representation, or, in certain\r
realizations, a proper subalgebra corresponding to a restricted set of generators.\r
In other words, part of the Lie algebra would be “invisible” to the spinors, and the\r
representation would effectively “forget” that portion of the algebraic structure.\r
□\r
From now on, we focus on a series of the U(2, 2) representations characterized by\r
a lowest weight state, treated as a “Fock vacuum” |0\r

under the maximal compact subgroup S\r

The identification of |0\r

. (3.42)\r
Note: A second series of U(2, 2) representations arises, corresponding to highest\u0002weight ladder representations, in which the conformal Hamiltonian is negative def\u0002inite. This situation occurs when the roles of the projectors P+ and P− are inter\u0002changed. However, this case will not be considered in the present work.\r
To make the subsequent discussion more transparent, we shall display a realization\r
of the 4 × 4 matrices 𝛾𝑖(with 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4) in accord with the construction (3.17). It\r
follows from Eqs. (2.190), (2.192), and (2.148) that:\r
7\r
In physics and mathematics — especially in group theory, quantum mechanics, and representation\r
theory — a singlet means a state or object that transforms trivially under the action of a group.\r
8\r
Its significance was recognized early on by Irving Segal (1918-1998) albiet in a rather speculative\r
context [107].

C1 = 𝜑 𝜑e = 𝔞∗𝔞 − 𝔟 𝔟∗ = 𝔞∗𝔞 − (𝔟\r

representative of the pseudoscalar (volume form) of 𝐸 = 𝑀(4, 2), as defined in Eq.\r

The normal ordering in (3.64) ensures that C1 is a Hermitian operator with a\r
well-defined spectrum. Since the bosonic operators 𝑁𝔞 := 𝔞∗𝔞 and 𝑁𝔟 := 𝔟∗𝔟, which\r
act on the Fock space, are number operators with non-negative integer eigenvalues,\r
their difference has integer eigenvalues in the Fock space realization. Thus, we can\r

This proposition reflects a general feature of IRs, where Casimir operators act as\r
scalars determined by the representation labels. As already pointed out, physically,\r
𝜆 plays the role of a helicity-like quantum number, so these Casimir eigenvalues\r
encode invariant properties of massless conformal fields classified by helicity 𝜆.\r
Proof — Step I (proof of Eq. (3.72)). Starting with Eq. (3.72), we observe that the\r
proof rests on the following essential tensor identity:\r

\u0002\r
𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜈\r
\u0003\r
. Let us first\r
justify the validity of this ansatz.\r
In even-dimensional spaces of dimension d (as in our case, d = 6), the Dirac\r
spinor representation has dimension 𝑁 = 2\r
d/2\r
, so the space of all 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrices\r
acting on spinors has dimension 𝑁\r
2 = 2d\r
. The corresponding Clifford algebra\r
provides a natural basis for this matrix space. Strictly speaking, it consists of the\r
antisymmetrized products of gamma matrices:\r
n\r
1, 𝛾𝜇, 𝛾𝜇𝜈, 𝛾𝜇𝜈𝜌, . . . , 𝛾𝜇1...𝜇d\r
o\r
, (3.74)\r
which are linearly independent and span the entire space of operators on spinor space;\r
one observes that the number of independent elements in this set is Íd\r
𝑘=0\r
\r
d\r
𝑘\r
\u0001\r
= 2\r
d =\r
𝑁\r
2\r
, exactly matching the dimension of the matrix space. Consequently, any matrix\r
𝑀 acting on spinors can be expressed as a linear combination of the corresponding\r
Clifford basis elements:\r
𝑀 = 𝑎 1 + 𝑏\r
𝜇\r
𝛾𝜇 + 𝑐\r
𝜇𝜈𝛾𝜇𝜈 + . . . , (3.75)\r
for some coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏𝜇, 𝑐𝜇𝜈, · · · ∈ C.\r
With these observations in mind, let us now return to the expression:\r
(𝛾𝜇𝜈)\r
𝑎\r
𝑏\r
(𝛾\r
𝜇𝜈)𝑐\r
𝑑\r
, (3.76)\r
which, by the preceding discussion, must be expressible as a linear combination of\r
the basis elements of the corresponding Clifford algebra, that is, 𝔠𝔩(4, 2). Because\r
the Lorentz indices 𝜇, 𝜈 are fully contracted, the resulting object must be a Lorentz\r
scalar. This rules out any terms involving uncontracted gamma matrices such as 𝛾𝜇,\r
𝛾𝜇𝜈𝜌, etc., which would transform as Lorentz tensors and hence violate the scalar\r
nature of the left-hand side. On the other hand, the spinor-index structure of the\r
right-hand side must also be built from Lorentz-invariant tensors in spinor space. In\r
the absence of additional invariant structures (e.g., a charge-conjugation matrix 𝐶 or\r
chirality projectors; as in our setup12), the only such invariant tensors are Kronecker\r
deltas:\r

are linearly independent and span\r
the space of Lorentz-invariant rank-(2, 2) spinor tensors.\r
Finally, note that the left-hand side is symmetric under the simultaneous exchange\r

This confirms that no additional index structures are needed, and the ansatz used in\r
the expansion (3.73) is the most general form consistent with Lorentz invariance and\r
spinor symmetry.\r
With the expansion (3.73) established, we now aim to determine the constants A\r
and B. To this end, we make use of standard trace identities of the Clifford algebra in\r
d dimensions (applicable to both odd and even d; here d = 6). The general identity\r
in d dimensions, for spinors of dimension 𝑁 (here 𝑁 = 4\r

— Step II (proof of Eq. (3.71)). Here, we turn our attention to the second identity\r
stated in the proposition, namely Eq. (3.71). To begin, and in analogy with expression\r
(3.34), we express 𝐽𝛼𝛽 in terms of spinor bilinears as:\r
𝐽𝛼𝛽 =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
𝜑 𝛾 e 𝛼𝛽 𝜑\r
\u0001\r
, 𝛾𝛼𝛽 =\r
1\r
2\r
\u0002\r
𝛾𝛼, 𝛾𝛽\r
\u0003\r
. (3.86)\r
Under this identification, the generators 𝐽𝛼𝛽 form a closed and complete set for the\r
Lie algebra 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1), as can be demonstrated using arguments analogous\r
to those in Remark 3.4.\r
It is important to emphasize that in odd-dimensional spaces of dimension d (for\r
example, d = 5, relevant for the dS case), the Clifford algebra, just as in the even\u0002dimensional case discussed earlier, provides a complete basis for 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrices\r
acting on spinor space, where 𝑁 = 2\r
⌊d/2⌋\r
. This basis consists of the antisymmetrized\r
products of gamma matrices (see Eq. (3.74)). Consequently, any spinor-valued matrix\r
can be expanded in terms of this basis. However, unlike in even dimensions, there\r
is no chirality operator in odd dimensions, so the corresponding representation is\r
irreducible by construction.\r
Following the same reasoning as in the previous step, we perform the expansion:\r
(𝛾𝛼𝛽)\r

Remark 3.6 It is worth noting that the dS (quadratic) Casimir C\r
𝔰𝔭(2,2)\r
2\r
= −2(𝜆\r
2 −1)\r
(3.71), derived within a rigorous Clifford-algebraic framework, provides a clear ex\u0002planation of the observation made by Barut and Böhm in 1970 [40] using a conven\u0002tional group-theoretic analysis of the conformal group. Restricting the ladder-type\r
UPEIRs of the conformal algebra to the dS subalgebra, the Casimir invariant (3.71)\r
coincides exactly with the quadratic Casimir eigenvalues of the dS group associ\u0002ated with the so-called massless representations (see Eq. (1.20)). By adopting the\r
conformal Clifford algebra 𝔠𝔩(4, 2) as the primary algebraic framework, this formu\u0002lation not only reproduces these results but also provides a geometrically enriched,\r
unified treatment of algebraic, spinorial, and conformal structures, facilitating the\r
construction and analysis of massless ladder representations and their restriction to\r
dS symmetry. This picture will be clarified further in the sequel. □

84 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r

algebra, defined by 𝐽𝜇𝜈 =\r
1\r
2\r
(𝜑 𝛾 e 𝜇𝜈 𝜑) (3.34), by providing an explicit and consistent\r
matrix realization of these generators. To this end, we employ Eq. (3.36), along with\r
the matrix representation of the 𝛾-matrices given in Proposition 3.1. Our analysis\r
begins with the elements of the (diagonal) Cartan subalgebra:\r

Remark 3.9 Before proceeding, let us clarify in what sense the operators 𝐸𝑎 and 𝐹𝑎\r
are called raising and lowering operators for representations of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2). Let |W⟩ be\r
a weight vector defined by:\r
𝐻𝑎 |W⟩ = W𝑎 |W⟩ , (3.132)\r
with weight components W = (W1, W2, W3) corresponding to the Cartan genera\u0002tors 𝐻1, 𝐻2, and 𝐻3; since the Cartan elements commute, they are simultaneously\r
diagonalizable, and thus admit a common eigenbasis. Consider the action of 𝐹𝑏 on\r
|W⟩. Using the commutation relation [𝐻𝑎, 𝐹𝑏] = −𝐴𝑎𝑏𝐹𝑏, we find:\r
𝐻𝑎\r
\r
𝐹𝑏 |W⟩\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
[𝐻𝑎, 𝐹𝑏] + 𝐹𝑏𝐻𝑎\r
\u0001\r
|W⟩ (3.133)\r
=\r

\u0001\r
|W⟩ (3.134)\r
=\r
\r
W𝑎 − 𝐴𝑎𝑏\u0001𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ . (3.135)\r
This shows that 𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ is again a weight vector, whose weight component is shifted\r
as:\r
W𝑎 ↦−→ W𝑎 − 𝐴𝑎𝑏 . (3.136)\r
Equivalently, the total weight vector transforms as:\r
𝐹𝑏 |W⟩ ↦−→\r
\f\r
\fW − 𝛼𝑏\r
\u000B\r
, (3.137)\r
where the simple root 𝛼𝑏 is given by the 𝑏-th column of the Cartan matrix 𝐴𝑎𝑏;\r
explicitly, 𝛼1 = (2, −1, 0)\r
⊤, 𝛼2 = (−1, 2, −1)⊤, and 𝛼3 = (0, −1, 2)⊤.\r
Similarly, the operator 𝐸𝑏 acts as a raising operator, shifting the weight vector\r
upward by the corresponding simple root:\r
𝐸𝑏 |W⟩ ∝\r
\f\r
\fW + 𝛼𝑏\r
\u000B\r
, (3.138)\r
where 𝛼𝑏 is the simple root associated with 𝐸𝑏. □\r
Given the above, we define the lowest weight state |LW𝜆⟩ of the UPEIR of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2)\r
(with a given helicity 𝜆) as:\r

bounded from below (see Eq. (3.41)).\r
Although this point has already been noted, it is appropriate to scrutinize, within\r

|𝜆|+1,0,|𝜆|\r

𝑠+1,0,𝑠 , with |𝜆| =: 𝑠 . (3.158)\r
The negative helicity arises from the fact that the lowest weight state |𝑠 + 1, 0, 𝑠⟩\r
in this representation transforms in the spin-𝑠 representation of 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅 and is a\r
singlet under 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 (see, again, Remark 3.10).\r

With this labelling, in the zero-helicity (𝜆 = 0) case, the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r

the zero-helicity space H\r

𝜆=0 — corresponding to the representation at the very\r
bottom of the ladder representations, with j𝐿 = j𝑅 = 0 and 𝜆 = 0 — coincides with\r
the state space of the non-relativistic, regularized hydrogen atom. This connection\r
was first uncovered in the 1960s through the study of spectrum-generating algebras.\r
Note: For a detailed account of how the conformal massless (ladder) UPEIR\r
restricts to the dS case, see Appendix 3.7. □\r
Remark 3.13 From the construction above, one immediately observes a key identity\r
that will prove useful in the sequel. Specifically, for any helicity parameter 𝜆 in the\r
lowest weight state, one has:\r
E◦ −\r
\r
j𝐿 + j𝑅\r

This relation naturally extends to all descendant states as:\r

94 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
Indeed, all descendant states are obtained by repeated action of the raising operators\r
𝐸𝑎 on the lowest weight state, which increases the eigenvalue of the conformal\r
Hamiltonian 𝐻 in discrete steps. Moreover, such actions leave the integer or half\u0002integer nature of j𝐿 + j𝑅 invariant. This latter observation can be viewed as a\r
by-product of the discussion in Appendix 3.7, in particular Eq. (3.292). □\r

In this representation of 𝔰𝔲(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 2), the generators 𝑇𝑖 and 𝐶𝑖 act by con\u0002struction as ladder operators, raising and lowering the eigenvalues of the conformal\r
Hamiltonian 𝐻, respectively. In particular, from the latter canonical commutation\r
relation, it follows that the lowering operators 𝐶𝑖 annihilate the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆⟩, which is an eigenstate of 𝐻 with eigenvalue E◦ := 1 + |𝜆| (see Eq. (3.142)):\r
𝐶𝑖|LW𝜆⟩ = 0 . (3.196)\r
The commutation relation (3.192) implies that the operators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗, which generate\r
the maximal compact subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅, leave invariant the\r
eigenspaces H\r
(1)\r
E\r
of the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻, as noted before. In a particularly\r
significant case, the operators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 act on the lowest weight state in the zero-helicity\r
(𝜆 = 0) case as follows:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ =: 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ = 0 . (3.197)\r
This condition explicitly demonstrates that the zero-helicity lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ transforms as a singlet under the maximal compact subgroup\r
SO(4), justifying its designation as a “Fock vacuum” with respect to this subgroup\r
(see Eq. (3.41) and the accompanying discussion). Of course, it should not be con\u0002fused with the unique conformally invariant zero-energy vacuum state |0\r
U(2,2)\r
⟩, which\r
is invariant under the full conformal group U(2, 2) and will be introduced later in\r
the context of the complete conformal field theory (CFT) construction.\r
Note that the identities stated in the above proposition can be proven either\r
within the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114) of the generators or in\u0002dependently, based on the intrinsic algebraic relations (3.37) among the 𝐽𝜇𝜈 entities\r
involved. For pedagogical clarity, we present below a proof that seeks to strike a\r
balance between these two approaches, highlighting in each case the method that\r
offers the more instructive perspective.\r
Proof — Step I (proof of the commutation relations (3.193)). The commutation\r
relations presented above can be readily derived from the known algebraic properties\r
(3.37) of the generators 𝐽𝜇𝜈. Nevertheless, it is instructive to verify them explicitly\r
within the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114) of the generators. As an\r
illustration, let us consider (3.193).\r
By employing Eq. (3.38) in combination with the previously established decom\u0002positions, we obtain the following commutation relations between the operators 𝐶𝑖\r
and 𝑇𝑗:

Proceeding analogously to the steps outlined above, with Eq. (3.38) in mind, the\r
remaining commutation relations (3.192), (3.194), and (3.195) follow directly within\r
the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-(3.114).\r
— Step II (proof of (3.196)). Using a procedure analogous to that described in\r
Remark 3.9, the proof of Eq. (3.196) follows directly from the commutation relation\r
(3.195). On the other hand, employing the oscillator (or twistor) realization (3.99)-\r
(3.114) of the generators, together with the definition (3.62), immediately leads to\r
Eq. (3.196).\r
— Step III (proof of (3.197)). Eq. (3.197) can be straightforwardly verified\r
through the (relevant) matrix realization (3.99)-(3.114), in conjunction with (3.62).\r
We, however, choose to present an alternative — and arguably more illustrative —\r
proof that relies purely on the algebraic relations intrinsic to the generators.\r
We begin with the conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 and the angular momentum-like\r
generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗, which satisfy the commutation relation [𝐻, 𝐽𝑖 𝑗] = 0 (3.192). This\r
relation implies that each 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 preserves the eigenspaces H\r
(1)\r
E\r
⊂ H\r

that is:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 ; H\r
(1)\r
E\r
↦−→ H (1)\r
E\r
. (3.199)\r
In particular, this invariance extends to the zero-helicity, lowest-energy eigenspace\r
H\r
(1)\r
E◦\r
, which contains solely (up to an overall scalar factor) the lowest weight state\r
|LW𝜆=0⟩ =: |0\r
SO(4)\r
⟩ =: |1, 0, 0⟩. As a matter of fact, as can be deduced from Eq.\r
(3.150) for j𝐿 = 0 = j𝑅, this eigenspace is 1-dimensional. It then naturally follows\r
that the action of 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 on this state must take the form:\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ = 𝛼𝑖 𝑗 |LW𝜆=0⟩ , (3.200)\r
for some scalar coefficients 𝛼𝑖 𝑗 ∈ C.\r
The generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 span the compact subalgebra 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅, and\r
therefore act as angular momentum operators. In any unitary representation, they\r
are represented by traceless anti-Hermitian matrices. On the 1-dimensional space\r
H\r
(1)\r
E◦\r
, the only possible linear operators are scalar multiples of the identity. Imposing"""

tracelessness forces the scalar to vanish. Hence, the only consistent possibility is:\r

— Step II (the proof of 2). The proof of the second item follows from a direct\r

. The map 𝑔𝑐 is\r
regular (holomorphic) on 𝔗+ provided that its denominator never vanishes there;\r
in other words, regularity of 𝑔𝑐 on the forward tube requires that Ω(𝑤) ≠ 0 for all\r
𝑤 ∈ 𝔗+.\r
Suppose, for contradiction, that Ω(𝑤) = 0 at some 𝑤 ∈ 𝔗+:\r
Ω(𝑤) =\r

𝜙ˆ(𝑧)\r
\u0001∗\r
as arising\r
from 𝜙ˆ(𝑧) via the conformal inversion.\r
— Step I (conformal inversion and Weyl scaling). Conformal inversion reads\r

3.5 4-dimensional Conformal Vertex Algebra\r
QFT is primarily concerned with the vacuum representation of products of quantum\r
fields. The algebra of globally conformally invariant fields — such as free massless\r
fields and their operator product expansions — fits naturally into the framework of\r
a 4-dimensional (or higher) vertex algebra, as developed in Ref. [114] and further\r
summarized in Section 4.3 of Ref. [115]. This formalism not only generalizes the\r
structure of field products beyond perturbation theory but also offers a more natural\r
and conceptually unified perspective than the explicit classification of individual\r
UPEIRs. We now proceed to outline its key features.\r
The states of the theory span a (pre-)Hilbert space23 H that carries a (reducible)\r
unitary representation 𝑈 of the conformal group U(2, 2), featuring a unique con\u000223 A “pre-Hilbert space” is a complex vector space equipped with a positive-definite inner product,\r
but not necessarily complete with respect to the induced norm. Its completion yields a Hilbert\r
space. In many QFT settings — especially CFT — the natural space of states is first defined as a\r
dense subspace of a Hilbert space, typically consisting of finite-energy or polynomially bounded\r
states. This subspace suffices for algebraic constructions, such as operator products and the action\r
of symmetry generators, and is often referred to as a pre-Hilbert space. The completion is then\r
required to rigorously establish limits and convergence. Thus, the term “pre-Hilbert space” reflects\r
whether one is working directly with the dense, physically meaningful subspace or with its Hilbert\r
space completion, depending on the level of mathematical rigor required.

This reflects the field’s transformation under the central element −14 ∈ Spin(4).\r
The sign ‘±’ determines the intrinsic parity of the field; even-parity (bosonic) fields\r
correspond to P = 0, and odd-parity (fermionic) fields to P = 1. As discussed\r
below, this assignment endows the fields with a Z2 grading that enters the strong\r
(Huygens) locality condition, governing whether fields commute or anticommute in\r
the graded operator algebra.\r
The strong (Huygens) locality condition assumes:24\r

for some sufficiently large integer 𝑁. The prefactor (𝑧 − 𝑢)\r
2\r
\u0001 𝑁\r
ensures that the\r
expression vanishes in the coincident limit𝑧 → 𝑢 and encodes the allowed singularity\r
structure in the operator product expansion. For a concrete example of this singular\r
behavior, see Eq. (3.244).\r
Proposition 3.8 The strong (or Huygens) locality condition (3.265), valid for some\r
sufficiently large integer 𝑁, reflects the fact that any pair of mutually nonisotropic\r
(non-null) points (𝑧, 𝑢) — that is, with (𝑧 −𝑢)\r
2 ≠ 0 — belongs to a single orbit of the\r
conformal group SU(2, 2) acting on compactified Minkowski space. In this global\r
setting, the invariant notion is not spacelike versus timelike separation, but rather\r
the null/non-null distinction.\r
Before turning to the proof, let us clarify the conceptual role of this condi\u0002tion. In flat Minkowski spacetime, strong (Huygens) locality is nothing more than\r
the operator-algebraic expression of microcausality; fields either commute or anti\u0002commute when evaluated at spacelike separated arguments. This interpretation is\r

unambiguous, since the local conformal group preserves the causal type of separa\u0002tion vectors, and hence the distinction between spacelike and timelike pairs is sharp\r
(see the proof below).\r
After conformal compactification, however, the situation changes essentially. The\r
global conformal group SU(2, 2) preserves null separations exactly, but no longer\r
preserves the spacelike/timelike distinction; under compactified conformal transfor\u0002mations, a spacelike pair may be mapped to a timelike one (see the proof below).\r
What remains invariant is therefore only the null versus non-null classification. In\r
this global setting, the strong locality condition must be reinterpreted: it is not “lo\u0002cality” in the conventional causal sense, but rather a conformally covariant regularity\r
requirement on operator products. Concretely, it guarantees that graded commuta\u0002tors vanish (up to their prescribed short-distance singularities) throughout the full\r
conformal orbit of non-null pairs under SU(2, 2).\r
When restricted back to the Minkowski patch, this broader condition reduces\r
precisely to the familiar microcausality principle, thereby reconciling the local and\r
global viewpoints.\r
Proof A rigorous proof of this proposition can be found in Ref. [114]. Here, however,\r
we outline an alternative approach that serves certain illustrative or pedagogical\r
purposes.\r
— Step I (transitive action of the conformal group on non-null point pairs\r
in Minkowski spacetime). Let 𝑀 \u001B R\r

conformal group is locally isomorphic to SU(2, 2). This group acts transitively on\r
the set of ordered point pairs (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈ R\r
3,1 × R3,1 with (𝑥 − 𝑦)2 ≠ 0, provided the\r
causal type of the separation vector is fixed (spacelike or timelike). We elaborate on\r

(3.34)). In this context, one may obtain the dS algebra by restricting attention to the\r
generators 𝐽𝛼𝛽, with 𝛼, 𝛽 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and discarding the generators 𝐽𝛼5; this yields\r
a 10-dimensional subalgebra isomorphic to 𝔰𝔭(2, 2) \u001B 𝔰𝔬(4, 1). In particular, the\r
conformal Hamiltonian 𝐻 = i𝐽05 does not belong to the dS subalgebra and therefore\r
cannot serve as a global energy operator or as an energy label E for dS UIRs; dS\r
representations are not classified by a global energy eigenvalue in the same way as\r
anti-dS representations (see Ref. [29]).\r
The maximal compact subalgebra of the dS algebra is 𝔰𝔬(4) \u001B 𝔰𝔲(2)𝐿 ⊕ 𝔰𝔲(2)𝑅,\r
generated by 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 with 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3, 4. Every state in a dS UIR can be labeled by\r
the compact quantum numbers (j𝐿, j𝑅), where again j𝐿 and j𝑅 are the familiar\r
SU(2) spins associated with the left and right SU(2) factors [93]. We now proceed\r
to elaborate on the structure and interpretation of these labels.\r
A multiplet will denote the collection of states |j𝐿, j𝑅; 𝑚𝐿, 𝑚𝑅⟩ transforming\r
irreducibly under 𝑆U(2)𝐿 × 𝑆U(2)𝑅 with fixed (j𝐿, j𝑅), where 𝑚𝐿 = −j𝐿, . . . , j𝐿\r
and 𝑚𝑅 = −j𝑅, . . . , j𝑅 label the magnetic quantum numbers. The dimension d of\r
such a multiplet is (2j𝐿 +1) (2j𝑅 +1) (see Eq. (3.150)). The compact generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗\r
act within each multiplet, mixing the magnetic quantum numbers while preserving\r
the total spins (j𝐿, j𝑅).\r
The remaining generators 𝐽0𝑖 (with 𝑖 = 1, . . . , 4), which span the noncompact\r
directions of 𝔰𝔬(4, 1), act between multiplets. Their commutation relations with the\r
compact generators are:\r
\u0002\r
𝐽𝑖 𝑗, 𝐽0𝑘\r
\u0003\r
=\r
\r
𝜂 𝑗𝑘 𝐽0𝑖 − 𝜂𝑖𝑘 𝐽0 𝑗\r
\u0001\r
, (3.291)\r
which shows that the operators 𝐽0𝑖transform in the vector (4-dimensional) rep\u0002resentation of the compact group SO(4). Under the homomorphism SO(4) \u001B\r
SU(2)𝐿 × SU(2)𝑅, this 4-vector corresponds to the bi-spinor representation \r

\r

,\r

2\r
\u0001\r
= (1 + 1) (1 + 1) = 4.\r
When 𝐽0𝑖 acts on a compact multiplet (j𝐿, j𝑅) it therefore produces states in the\r
tensor product:\r

with the obvious convention that any term with a negative spin is omitted. Thus, the\r
noncompact generators connect up to four neighboring SO(4) multiplets; repeated\r
application of the noncompact generators builds a “tower of multiplets” which,\r
together with the action of the compact algebra, spans the full UIR Hilbert space.\r
Remark 3.18 The foregoing “tower of SO(4) multiplets” picture is the natural de\u0002scription for the dS discrete-series type representations (those admitting lowest or\r
highest weight with respect to the compact subalgebra). For the dS principal-series\r
and complementary-series representations, the structure is different (continuous la\u0002bels arise and the decomposition into compact multiplets must be handled with the\r
appropriate spectral-theoretic tools), so the seed-multiplet construction should be\r
understood in the appropriate representational context. □

122 3 Ladder Representation of 𝔲(2, 2) as a Quantized 4-dimensional Realization\r
In summary, a dS UIR decomposes into a (generally countable) collection of\r
SO(4) multiplets (j𝐿, j𝑅). The compact generators 𝐽𝑖 𝑗 act within each multiplet,\r
whereas the noncompact generators 𝐽0𝑖link multiplets according to the Clebsch\u0002Gordan decomposition with \r
1\r
2\r
,\r
1\r
2\r
\u0001\r
; there is no analogue of a globally conserved\r
energy label as in anti-dS space.\r
For the dS massless UIRs, the structure simplifies. As a direct consequence of the\r
preceding discussion, the full Hilbert space is generated from a chiral seed multiplet:\r
(j𝐿, j𝑅) = (𝑠, 0) or (0, 𝑠) , with 𝑠 := |𝜆| = 0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . . , (3.293)\r
where the helicity is encoded in the chirality of the seed multiplet (see Remark 3.10):\r
(𝑠, 0) −→ (helicity + 𝑠) , (0, 𝑠) −→ (helicity − 𝑠) . (3.294)\r

6. Huygens principle and propagation along null directions: In Minkowski space\u0002time, the Huygens principle for massless fields asserts that wave propagation is\r
strictly supported on null directions. If a scalar field 𝜙(𝑥) satisfies the massless\r
wave equation:\r
□𝜙(𝑥) = 𝜂\r
𝜇¤ 𝜈¤\r
𝜕𝜇¤ 𝜕𝜈¤𝜙(𝑥) = 0 , (3.315)\r
then a compactly supported disturbance at a spacetime point 𝑥◦ propagates\r
exclusively along the light cone (𝑥 −𝑥◦)\r
2 = 0. In particular, the solution exhibits\r
no tail inside the cone: the field vanishes identically both inside and outside the\r
null hypersurface determined by 𝑥◦. Hence, the causal propagation of massless\r
signals is completely governed by null directions.\r
Within the projective framework, this principle admits a natural geometric for\u0002mulation. Each point 𝜁 ∈ P𝑄 encodes a null direction in spacetime and thus\r
determines a lightlike ray along which massless disturbances propagate. Via the\r
homogeneous embedding (3.305), the ambient null condition 𝜁\r
2 = 0 projects\r
precisely onto the spacetime light-cone condition (𝑥−𝑥◦)\r
2 = 0. Families of such\r
rays generate wavefronts, while caustics arise at points where the projection from\r
P𝑄 to spacetime fails to be regular, namely:\r
det 𝜕𝑥𝜇¤\r
𝜕𝜃𝑖\r
= 0 , (3.316)\r
with 𝜃\r
𝑖 parametrizing the ray family. Since P𝑄 is compact and carries a natural\r
action of the conformal group, this description is global and conformally in\u0002variant, providing a robust geometric framework for analyzing the propagation\r
and focusing of massless perturbations, notably in cosmological and inflationary\r
applications.\r

Conformal Massless Low Helicity Fields and\r
their de Sitter (dS) Spacetime Restriction\r
Abstract This chapter presents a systematic construction of low-helicity conformal\r
massless fields, with particular emphasis on the zero-helicity case in de Sitter (dS)\r
spacetime. It begins by formulating the massless scalar field in terms of ladder-type\r
vertex operators built from Bose creation and annihilation operators, supplemented\r
by zero-mode operators that ensure the correct lowest-energy states and reproduce\r
the canonical two-point functions. The analytic structure of these operators is estab\u0002lished within a precompact tube domain, ensuring convergence of the corresponding\r
harmonic polynomial expansions.\r
Subsequently, it describes the restriction of conformal massless fields from the\r
6-dimensional conformal space to 4-dimensional dS spacetime, emphasizing the role\r
of homogeneous functions on the light cone and the associated gauge freedom. The\r
construction elucidates the relation between Euclidean coordinates in the analyti\u0002cally continued half-space and Minkowski-type coordinates, highlighting the Weyl\r
rescaling that connects the conformally flat metric to the standard dS metric.\r
Finally, the chapter demonstrates how the 6-dimensional conformally invariant\r
two-point functions project naturally onto dS spacetime, yielding the standard dS\r
two-point functions for massless scalar fields. These results provide a rigorous frame\u0002work for understanding the interplay between conformal symmetry, low helicity\r
fields, and their geometric realization in curved spacetimes."""

function on dS spacetime (see, for instance, Ref. [49]\r
3\r
) can be recovered from the\r
manifestly invariant one defined on the 6-dimensional light cone. In this setting, the\r
corresponding two-point function takes the form:\r

= 2𝑛 𝑓 + 4𝜁 · 𝜕 𝑓 .\r
Now, if 𝑓 = 𝝓 is homogeneous of degree 𝑑 − 2, then 𝜁 · 𝜕𝝓 = (𝑑 − 2)𝝓, and thus:\r

In 𝑛 = 6 dimensions, this vanishes only when 𝑑 = −1.\r

In Ref. [49], the metric signature is chosen to be mostly negative, in contrast to the convention\r
adopted in this manuscript. As a result, certain terms in the corresponding two-point function differ\r
from ours by a sign.
