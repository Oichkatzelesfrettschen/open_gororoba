A holographic derivation of the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) field theories is\r
proposed from AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that the entanglement entropy ind + 1 dimen\u0002sional conformal field theories can be obtained from the area of d dimensional minimal surfaces in\r
AdS\r
d+2, analogous to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for black hole entropy. We show that our\r
proposal perfectly reproduces the correct entanglement entropy in 2D CFT when applied to AdS\r
3\r
.\r
We also compare the entropy computed in AdS\r
5\r
×S\r
5 with that of the free\r
N = 4 super Yang-Mills.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
One of the most remarkable successes in gravitational\r
aspects of string theory is the microscopic derivation of\r
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropySBH\r
SBH=\r
Area of horizon 4GN\r
, (1.1)\r
for BPS black holes [1]. This idea relates the gravi\u0002tational entropy with the degeneracy of quantum field\r
theory as its microscopic description. Taking near hori\u0002zon limit, we can regard this as a special example of\r
AdS/CFT correspondence [2, 3, 4]. It claims that the d + 1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFTd+1) are\r
equivalent to the (super)gravity ond+2 dimensional anti\u0002deSitter space AdSd+2. We expect that each CFT is sit\u0002ting at the boundary of AdS space.\r
On the other hand, there is a different kind of entropy\r
called entanglement entropy (von-Neumann entropy) in\r
quantum mechanical systems. The entanglement entropy SA = −trA ρA log ρA, ρA = trB |ΨihΨ|, (1.2)\r
provides us with a convenient way to measure how closely\r
entangled (or how “quantum”) a given wave function |Ψi\r
is. Here, the total system is divided into two subsystems A and B and ρA is the reduced density matrix for the\r
subsystemA obtained by taking a partial trace over the\r
subsystemB of the total density matrixρ= |ΨihΨ|. In\u0002tuitively, we can think SA as the entropy for an observer\r
who is only accessible to the subsystemA and cannot\r
receive any signals fromB. In this sense, the subsystem\r
B is analogous to the inside of a black hole horizon for an\r
observer sitting inA, i.e., outside of the horizon. Indeed,\r
an original motivation of the entanglement entropy was\r
its similarity to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [5, 6].\r
The entanglement entropy is of growing importance\r
in many fields of physics in our exploration for better\r
understanding of quantum systems. For example, in a\r
modern trend of condensed matter physics it has been\r
becoming clear that quantum phases of matter need to be\r
characterized by their pattern of entanglement encoded\r
in many-body wave functions of ground states, rather\r
than conventional order parameters [7, 8, 9]. Recently,\r
the entanglement entropy has been extensively studied in\r
low-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a new\r
tool to investigate the nature of quantum criticality (refer\r
to [10] and references therein for example).\r
For one-dimensional (1D) quantum many-body sys\u0002tems at criticality (i.e. 2D CFT), it is known that the\r
entanglement entropy is given by [10, 11] SA = c3 · log \u0012 L\r
πa\r
sin\r
\u0012\r
πl L\r
\u0013\u0013\r
, (1.3)\r
wherel andL are the length of the subsystemA and\r
the total systemA∪B (both ends ofA∪B are peri\u0002odically identified), respectively; a is a ultra violet (UV)\r
cutoff (lattice spacing);c is the central charge of the CFT.\r
When we are away from criticality, Eq. (1.3) is replaced\r
by [7, 10]\r
S\r

· A · log\r
ξa\r
, (1.4)\r
whereξ is the correlation length andA is the number of\r
boundary points ofA (e.g.A = 2 in the setup of (1.3)).\r
In spite of these recent developments, and its simi\u0002larity to the black hole entropy, a comprehensive gravi\u0002tational interpretation of the entanglement entropy has\r
been lacking so far. Here, we present a simple proposal\r
on this issue in the light of AdS/CFT duality. Earlier\r
discussions from different viewpoints can be found in e.g.\r
papers [12, 13]. Define the entanglement entropyS\r
A in\r
a CFT onR\r
1,d (or\r
R×S\r
d\r
) for a subsystemA that has an\r
arbitraryd− 1 dimensional boundary ∂A∈R\r
d\r
(orS\r
d\r
).\r
In this setup we propose the following ‘area law’ SA =\r
Area ofγ\r

(d+2) N\r
, (1.5)\r
whereγ\r
A is the\r
d dimensional static minimal surface in\r
AdS\r
d+2 whose boundary is given by ∂A, and\r
G\r
(d+2) N is\r
thed + 2 dimensional Newton constant. Intuitively, this\r
suggests that the minimal surfaceγ\r
A plays the role of a\r
holographic screen for an observer who is only accessible\r
to the subsystemA. We show explicitly the relation (1.5)\r
in the lowest dimensional cased = 1, whereγ\r
A is given\r
by a geodesic line in AdS\r
3. We also compute\r
S\r
A from the\r
gravity side for generald and compare it with field theory\r
results, which is successful at least qualitatively. From\r
(1.5), it is readily seen that the basic properties of the\r

(subadditivity) are\r
satisfied.\r
We can also define the entanglement entropy at finite\r
temperature T = β\r
−1\r
. E.g. in a 2D CFT on a infinitely\r
long line, it is given by replacing L in Eq. (1.3) with iβ\r
[10]. We argue that Eq. (1.5) still holds in T > 0 cases.\r
Note that SA = SB is no longer true if T > 0 since ρ\r
is in a mixed state generically. At high temperature, we\r
will see that this occurs due to the presence of black hole\r
horizon in the dual gravity description.\r
II. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY IN AdS3/CFT2\r
Let us start with the entanglement entropy in 2D\r
CFTs. According to AdS/CFT correspondence, gravi\u0002tational theories on AdS3 space of radius R are dual to\r
(1+1)D CFTs with the central charge [14]\r
c =\r
3R\r
2G\r
(3)\r
N\r
. (2.1)\r
The metric of AdS3 in the global coordinate (t, ρ, θ) is\r
ds2 = R\r
2\r
\r
− cosh ρ\r
2\r
dt2 + dρ2 + sinh ρ\r
2\r
dθ2\r
\u0001\r
. (2.2)\r
At the boundary ρ = ∞ of AdS3 the metric is divergent.\r
To regulate physical quantities we put a cutoff ρ0 and\r
restrict the space to the bounded region ρ ≤ ρ0. This\r
procedure corresponds to the UV cutoff in the dual CFTs\r
[15]. If L is the total length of the system with both ends\r
identified, and a is the lattice spacing (or UV cutoff) in\r
the CFTs, we have the relation (up to a numerical factor)\r
e\r
ρ0 ∼ L/a. (2.3)\r
The (1+1)D spacetime for the CFT2 is identified with\r
the cylinder (t, θ) at the boundary ρ = ρ0. The subsys\u0002tem A is the region 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2πl/L. Then γA in Eq. (1.5)\r
is identified with the static geodesic that connects the\r
boundary points θ = 0 and 2πl/L with t fixed, traveling\r
inside AdS3 (Fig. 1 (a)). With the cutoff ρ0 introduced\r
above, the geodesic distance LγA is given by\r
cosh \u0012\r
LγA\r
R\r
\u0013\r
= 1 + 2 sinh2ρ0 sin2 πl\r
L\r
. (2.4)\r
Assuming the large UV cutoff e\r
ρ0 ≫ 1, the entropy\r
(1.5) is expressed as follows, using Eq. (2.1)\r
SA ≃\r

. (2.5)\r
This entropy precisely coincides with the known CFT\r
result (1.3) after we remember the relation Eq. (2.3).\r
This proposed relation (1.5) suggests that the geodesic\r
(or minimal surface in the higher dimensional case) γA is\r
analogous to an event horizon as if B were a black hole,\r
though the division into A and B is just artificial. In\r
other words, the observer, who is not accessible to B, will\r
probe γA as a holographic screen [16], instead of B itself\r
(Fig. 1 (b)). The minimal surface provides the severest\r
entropy bound when we fix its boundary condition. In\r
our case it saturates the bound.\r
More generally, we can consider a subsystem A which\r
consists of multiple disjoint intervals as follows\r
A = {x|x ∈ [r1, s1] ∪ [r2, s2] ∪ · · · ∪ [rN , sN ]}, (2.6)\r
where 0 ≤ r1 < s1 < r2 < s2 < · · · < rN < sN ≤ L. In\r
the dual AdS3 description, the region (2.6) corresponds\r
to θ ∈ ∪N\r
i=1[\r
2πri\r
L\r
,\r
2πsi\r
L\r
] at the boundary. In this case it\r
is not straightforward to determine minimal (geodesic)\r
lines responsible for the entropy. However, we can find\r
the answer from the entanglement entropy computed in\r
the CFT side. The general prescription of calculating the\r
entropy for such systems is given in [10] using conformal\r
mapping. For our system (2.6), we find, when rewritten\r
in the AdS3 language, the following expression of SA\r
SA =\r
P\r

P\r
i<j Lrj ,ri−\r
P\r
i<j Lsj ,si\r
4G\r
(3)\r
N\r
, (2.7)\r
where La,b is the geodesic distance between two boundary\r
points a and b. We can think that the correct definition\r
of minimal surface is given by the numerator in Eq. (2.7).\r
Next we turn to the entanglement entropy at finite\r
temperature. We assume the spacial length of the total\r
system L is infinitely long s.t. β/L ≪ 1. At high tem\u0002perature, the gravity dual of the CFT is the Euclidean\r
BTZ black hole [17] with the metric given by\r
ds2 = (r\r
2 − r2\r
+)dτ 2 +\r
R2\r
r\r
2 − r\r
2\r
+\r
dr2 + r\r
2\r
dϕ2. (2.8)\r
The Euclidean time is compactified as τ ∼ τ +\r
2πR\r
r+\r
to\r
obtain a smooth geometry in addition to the periodicity\r
ϕ ∼ ϕ+2π. Looking at its boundary, we find the relation\r
β\r
L =\r
R\r
r+ ≪ 1 between the CFT and the BTZ black hole.\r
The subsystem A is defined by 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 2πl/L at the\r
boundary. Then we expect that the entropy can be com\u0002puted from the geodesic distance between the boundary\r
points ϕ = 0, 2πl/L at a fixed time. To find the geodesic\r
line, it is useful to remember the familiar fact that the\r
Euclidean BTZ black hole at temperature TBT Z is equiv\u0002alent to the thermal AdS3 at temperature 1/TBT Z. This

3\r
equivalence can be interpreted as a modular transfor\u0002mation in the CFT side [18]. If we define the new co\u0002ordinates r = r+ cosh ρ, r+τ = Rθ, r+ϕ = Rt, then\r
the metric (2.8) indeed becomes the Euclidean version of\r
AdS3 metric (2.2). Thus the geodesic distance can be\r
found in the same way as in Eq. (2.4) : cosh(LγA /R) =\r
1 + 2 cosh2ρ0 sinh2\r
\u0010\r
πl\r
β\r
\u0011\r
, where the UV cutoff is inter\u0002preted as e\r
ρ0 ∼ β/a. Then the area law (1.5) reproduces\r
the known CFT result [10]\r

We can extend these arguments to the multi interval\r
cases and find the same formula (2.7) as before.\r
It is instructive to repeat the same analysis in the\r
Poincare metric ds2 = R2z\r
−2\r
(dz2 − dx2\r
0 + dr2\r
). We de\u0002fine the subsystem A by the region −l/2 ≤ r ≤ l/2 at\r
the boundary z = 0. The geodesic line γA is given by\r
(r, z) = l\r
2\r
(cos s,sin s), (ǫ ≤ s ≤ π − ǫ), (2.10)\r
where the infinitesimal ǫ is the UV cutoff ǫ ∼ 2a/l (or\r
equally zUV ∼ a). We obtain the entropy SA as follows\r

This reproduces the small l limit of Eq. (1.3) [11] .\r
When we perturb a CFT by a relevant perturbation,\r
the RG flow generically drives the theory to a trivial IR\r
fixed point. We denote the correlation length ξ in the\r
latter theory. In the AdS dual, this massive deformation\r
corresponds to capping off the IR region, restricting the\r
allowed values of z to z ≤ ξ. In the large l limit, we find\r

This agrees with the CFT result with A = 1 (1.4) [7, 10].\r
III. HIGHER DIMENSIONAL CASES\r
Motivated by the success in our gravitational deriva\u0002tion of the entanglement entropy for d = 1, it is inter\u0002esting to extend the idea to higher dimensional cases\r
(d ≥ 2). A natural thing to do is to replace geodesic\r
lines with minimal surfaces. The computations are anal\u0002ogous to the evaluation of Wilson loops [19], though the\r
dimension of relevant minimal surfaces is different.\r
We will work in the Poincare metric for AdSd+2\r

For d even, pd/C = (2√\r

and for d odd,\r
q/C = (−)\r
(d−1)/2\r
(d − 2)!!/(d − 1)!!.\r
From these results, the entanglement entropy can be\r
calculated by Eq. (1.5). Each of (3.2) and (3.3) has a\r
UV divergent term ∼ a\r
−d+1 that is proportional to the\r
area of the boundary ∂A. This agrees with the known\r
‘area law’ of the entanglement entropy in quantum field\r
theories [5, 6]. Note that this ‘area law’ is related to ours\r
Eq. (1.5) via the basic property of holography.\r
We may prefer a physical quantity that is independent\r
of the cutoff (i.e. universal). The second term in Eq. (3.2)\r
has this property. In general, when A is a finite size, there\r
is a universal and conformal invariant constant contribu\u0002tion to SA if d is even (see [20] for properties of minimal\r
surfaces in AdS). In (2+1)D topological field theories the\r
constant contribution to SA encodes the quantum dimen\u0002sion and is called the topological entanglement entropy\r
[8, 9]. If d is odd, the coefficient of the logarithmic term\r
∼ log(l/a) is universal as in Eq. (1.3).\r
Let us apply the previous results to a specific string\r
theory setup. Type IIB string on AdS5 × S\r
5\r
is dual to

4\r
4D N = 4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory [2]. The\r
radius of AdS5 and S\r
5 are given by the same value R =\r

10D one via G\r

It is interesting to compare the finite universal term in\r
Eq. (3.4) with the field theory one. For free real scalars\r
and fermions in general dimensions, one way to com\u0002pute SAS\r
is presented in [21] (see also [22]). Indeed,\r
this leads to the same behavior in a and l as in Eq.\r
(3.4). Following this approach, we can estimate finite\r
contributions from 6 scalars and 4 Majorana fermions in\r
the N = 4 Yang-Mills multiplet. In the end, we obtain\r
S\r
f reeCF T\r
f inite ∼ −(0.068 + g) · N2L\r
2/l2\r
, where g is the con\u0002tribution from the gauge field (g = 0.010 if we treat the\r
gauge field as 2 scalars). On the other hand, our AdS5\r
result (3.4) leads to S\r
AdS\r
f inite ∼ −0.051 · N2L\r
2/l2\r
. We may\r
think this is a good agreement if we remember that the\r
gravity description corresponds to the strongly coupled\r
gauge theory instead of the free theory as in [23].\r
We can also compute the entanglement entropy for the\r

We can regard this entropy as a part of the Bekenstein\u0002Hawking entropy of black 5-branes [23], which is propor\u0002tional to the area of horizon situated at u = u0. Thus we\r
can interpret the part (4.3) as a thermal entropy contri\u0002bution to the total entanglement entropy at finite tem\u0002perature. In our gravitational description, this part arises\r
because the minimal surface wraps a part of the black\r
hole horizon (Fig. 3 (a)). If we expand the size of A until\r
it coincides with the total system (in the global coordi\u0002nate), γA wraps the horizon completely and SA becomes\r
equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as expected.\r
In a sense, the overall normalization in Eq. (1.5) is fixed\r
from Eq. (1.1) once we consider the entanglement entropy\r
at finite temperature. Note that at finite temperature,\r
SA = SB does not hold generically. In the present situ\u0002ation, this occurs because the surfaces γA and γB wrap\r
two different parts of the horizon (Fig. 3 (b)).\r
As argued in [13, 26], the AdS black hole can be dual to\r
an entanglement of two different CFTs at the two bound\u0002aries. It is interesting to look at the minimal surfaces that\r
connect them. As a specific limit, we may think the black\r
hole entropy is the same as the entanglement entropy of\r
the CFTs as the minimal surface wrap the horizon.\r
V. CONCLUSION\r
In this paper we proposed a holographic description of\r
the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) field\r
theories via AdSd+2/CFTd+1 correspondence. This is\r
summarized as the area law relation (1.5). Based on\r
our proposal we computed the entanglement entropy for\r
various systems, e.g. 2D CFTs and the 4D large-N N =\r
4 super Yang-Mills theory. We checked that in the lowest\r
dimensional case (d = 1), our formula exactly coincides\r
with the entropy computed directly from CFT.

5\r
In higher dimensions (d ≥ 2), a quantitative compar\u0002ison is not easy because the gravity description corre\u0002sponds to the strongly coupled gauge theory whose entan\u0002glement entropy is not known at present. Nevertheless,\r
we found that our computation for AdS5 ×S\r
5\r
reproduces\r
the same functional form of entanglement entropy as the\r
one in the 4D free N = 4 super Yang-Mills. Their nu\u0002merical coefficients only differ by a factor ∼ 3\r
2\r
in a rough\r
estimation (assuming that the gauge field contribution is\r
the same as that of two real scalar fields). This is similar\r
to the well-known result of the thermal entropy [23].\r
Finally we computed the entanglement entropy at fi\u0002nite temperature employing AdS black hole geometry. In\r
this case the minimal surface wraps a fraction of the black\r
hole horizon and this part is responsible for the thermal\r
contribution.\r

A holographic derivation of the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) field theories is\r

I. INTRODUCTION\r
One of the most remarkable successes in gravitational\r
aspects of string theory is the microscopic derivation of\r
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropySBH\r
SBH=\r
Area of horizon 4GN\r
, (1.1)\r
for BPS black holes [1]. This idea relates the gravi\u0002tational entropy with the degeneracy of quantum field\r
theory as its microscopic description. Taking near hori\u0002zon limit, we can regard this as a special example of\r
AdS/CFT correspondence [2, 3, 4]. It claims that the d + 1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFTd+1) are\r
equivalent to the (super)gravity ond+2 dimensional anti\u0002deSitter space AdSd+2. We expect that each CFT is sit\u0002ting at the boundary of AdS space.\r
On the other hand, there is a different kind of entropy\r
called entanglement entropy (von-Neumann entropy) in\r
quantum mechanical systems. The entanglement entropy SA = −trA ρA log ρA, ρA = trB |ΨihΨ|, (1.2)\r
provides us with a convenient way to measure how closely\r
entangled (or how “quantum”) a given wave function |Ψi\r
is. Here, the total system is divided into two subsystems A and B and ρA is the reduced density matrix for the\r
subsystemA obtained by taking a partial trace over the\r
subsystemB of the total density matrixρ= |ΨihΨ|. In\u0002tuitively, we can think SA as the entropy for an observer\r
who is only accessible to the subsystemA and cannot\r
receive any signals fromB. In this sense, the subsystem\r
B is analogous to the inside of a black hole horizon for an\r
observer sitting inA, i.e., outside of the horizon. Indeed,\r
an original motivation of the entanglement entropy was\r
its similarity to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy [5, 6].\r
The entanglement entropy is of growing importance\r
in many fields of physics in our exploration for better\r
understanding of quantum systems. For example, in a\r
modern trend of condensed matter physics it has been\r
becoming clear that quantum phases of matter need to be\r
characterized by their pattern of entanglement encoded\r
in many-body wave functions of ground states, rather\r
than conventional order parameters [7, 8, 9]. Recently,\r
the entanglement entropy has been extensively studied in\r
low-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a new\r
tool to investigate the nature of quantum criticality (refer\r
to [10] and references therein for example).\r
For one-dimensional (1D) quantum many-body sys\u0002tems at criticality (i.e. 2D CFT), it is known that the\r
entanglement entropy is given by [10, 11] SA = c3 · log \u0012 L\r

wherel andL are the length of the subsystemA and\r
the total systemA∪B (both ends ofA∪B are peri\u0002odically identified), respectively; a is a ultra violet (UV)\r
cutoff (lattice spacing);c is the central charge of the CFT.\r
When we are away from criticality, Eq. (1.3) is replaced\r

In spite of these recent developments, and its simi\u0002larity to the black hole entropy, a comprehensive gravi\u0002tational interpretation of the entanglement entropy has\r
been lacking so far. Here, we present a simple proposal\r
on this issue in the light of AdS/CFT duality. Earlier\r
discussions from different viewpoints can be found in e.g.\r
papers [12, 13]. Define the entanglement entropyS\r

We can also define the entanglement entropy at finite\r

[10]. We argue that Eq. (1.5) still holds in T > 0 cases.\r
Note that SA = SB is no longer true if T > 0 since ρ\r
is in a mixed state generically. At high temperature, we\r
will see that this occurs due to the presence of black hole\r
horizon in the dual gravity description.\r
II. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY IN AdS3/CFT2\r
Let us start with the entanglement entropy in 2D\r
CFTs. According to AdS/CFT correspondence, gravi\u0002tational theories on AdS3 space of radius R are dual to\r
(1+1)D CFTs with the central charge [14]\r
c =\r

The metric of AdS3 in the global coordinate (t, ρ, θ) is\r
ds2 = R\r
2\r
\r
− cosh ρ\r
2\r
dt2 + dρ2 + sinh ρ\r
2\r
dθ2\r
\u0001\r
. (2.2)\r
At the boundary ρ = ∞ of AdS3 the metric is divergent.\r
To regulate physical quantities we put a cutoff ρ0 and\r
restrict the space to the bounded region ρ ≤ ρ0. This\r
procedure corresponds to the UV cutoff in the dual CFTs\r
[15]. If L is the total length of the system with both ends\r
identified, and a is the lattice spacing (or UV cutoff) in\r
the CFTs, we have the relation (up to a numerical factor)\r
e\r
ρ0 ∼ L/a. (2.3)\r
The (1+1)D spacetime for the CFT2 is identified with\r
the cylinder (t, θ) at the boundary ρ = ρ0. The subsys\u0002tem A is the region 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2πl/L. Then γA in Eq. (1.5)\r
is identified with the static geodesic that connects the\r
boundary points θ = 0 and 2πl/L with t fixed, traveling\r
inside AdS3 (Fig. 1 (a)). With the cutoff ρ0 introduced\r
above, the geodesic distance LγA is given by\r

LγA\r
R\r
\u0013\r
= 1 + 2 sinh2ρ0 sin2 πl\r

Assuming the large UV cutoff e\r
ρ0 ≫ 1, the entropy\r
(1.5) is expressed as follows, using Eq. (2.1)\r

. (2.5)\r
This entropy precisely coincides with the known CFT\r
result (1.3) after we remember the relation Eq. (2.3).\r
This proposed relation (1.5) suggests that the geodesic\r
(or minimal surface in the higher dimensional case) γA is\r
analogous to an event horizon as if B were a black hole,\r
though the division into A and B is just artificial. In\r
other words, the observer, who is not accessible to B, will\r
probe γA as a holographic screen [16], instead of B itself\r
(Fig. 1 (b)). The minimal surface provides the severest\r
entropy bound when we fix its boundary condition. In\r
our case it saturates the bound.\r
More generally, we can consider a subsystem A which\r
consists of multiple disjoint intervals as follows\r
A = {x|x ∈ [r1, s1] ∪ [r2, s2] ∪ · · · ∪ [rN , sN ]}, (2.6)\r
where 0 ≤ r1 < s1 < r2 < s2 < · · · < rN < sN ≤ L. In\r
the dual AdS3 description, the region (2.6) corresponds\r
to θ ∈ ∪N\r
i=1[\r
2πri\r
L\r
,\r
2πsi\r
L\r
] at the boundary. In this case it\r
is not straightforward to determine minimal (geodesic)\r
lines responsible for the entropy. However, we can find\r
the answer from the entanglement entropy computed in\r
the CFT side. The general prescription of calculating the\r
entropy for such systems is given in [10] using conformal\r
mapping. For our system (2.6), we find, when rewritten\r
in the AdS3 language, the following expression of SA\r
SA =\r
P\r
i,j Lrj ,si−\r
P\r
i<j Lrj ,ri−\r
P\r
i<j Lsj ,si\r
4G\r
(3)\r
N\r
, (2.7)\r
where La,b is the geodesic distance between two boundary\r
points a and b. We can think that the correct definition\r
of minimal surface is given by the numerator in Eq. (2.7).\r
Next we turn to the entanglement entropy at finite\r
temperature. We assume the spacial length of the total\r
system L is infinitely long s.t. β/L ≪ 1. At high tem\u0002perature, the gravity dual of the CFT is the Euclidean\r
BTZ black hole [17] with the metric given by\r
ds2 = (r\r
2 − r2\r
+)dτ 2 +\r
R2\r
r\r
2 − r\r
2\r
+\r
dr2 + r\r
2\r
dϕ2. (2.8)\r
The Euclidean time is compactified as τ ∼ τ +\r
2πR\r
r+\r
to\r
obtain a smooth geometry in addition to the periodicity\r
ϕ ∼ ϕ+2π. Looking at its boundary, we find the relation\r
β\r
L =\r
R\r
r+ ≪ 1 between the CFT and the BTZ black hole.\r
The subsystem A is defined by 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 2πl/L at the\r
boundary. Then we expect that the entropy can be com\u0002puted from the geodesic distance between the boundary\r
points ϕ = 0, 2πl/L at a fixed time. To find the geodesic\r
line, it is useful to remember the familiar fact that the\r
Euclidean BTZ black hole at temperature TBT Z is equiv\u0002alent to the thermal AdS3 at temperature 1/TBT Z. This

3\r
equivalence can be interpreted as a modular transfor\u0002mation in the CFT side [18]. If we define the new co\u0002ordinates r = r+ cosh ρ, r+τ = Rθ, r+ϕ = Rt, then\r
the metric (2.8) indeed becomes the Euclidean version of\r
AdS3 metric (2.2). Thus the geodesic distance can be\r
found in the same way as in Eq. (2.4) : cosh(LγA /R) =\r
1 + 2 cosh2ρ0 sinh2\r
\u0010\r
πl\r
β\r
\u0011\r
, where the UV cutoff is inter\u0002preted as e\r
ρ0 ∼ β/a. Then the area law (1.5) reproduces\r
the known CFT result [10]\r

We can extend these arguments to the multi interval\r
cases and find the same formula (2.7) as before.\r
It is instructive to repeat the same analysis in the\r
Poincare metric ds2 = R2z\r
−2\r
(dz2 − dx2\r
0 + dr2\r
). We de\u0002fine the subsystem A by the region −l/2 ≤ r ≤ l/2 at\r
the boundary z = 0. The geodesic line γA is given by\r
(r, z) = l\r
2\r
(cos s,sin s), (ǫ ≤ s ≤ π − ǫ), (2.10)\r
where the infinitesimal ǫ is the UV cutoff ǫ ∼ 2a/l (or\r
equally zUV ∼ a). We obtain the entropy SA as follows\r

When we perturb a CFT by a relevant perturbation,\r
the RG flow generically drives the theory to a trivial IR\r
fixed point. We denote the correlation length ξ in the\r
latter theory. In the AdS dual, this massive deformation\r
corresponds to capping off the IR region, restricting the\r
allowed values of z to z ≤ ξ. In the large l limit, we find\r

This agrees with the CFT result with A = 1 (1.4) [7, 10].\r
III. HIGHER DIMENSIONAL CASES\r
Motivated by the success in our gravitational deriva\u0002tion of the entanglement entropy for d = 1, it is inter\u0002esting to extend the idea to higher dimensional cases\r
(d ≥ 2). A natural thing to do is to replace geodesic\r
lines with minimal surfaces. The computations are anal\u0002ogous to the evaluation of Wilson loops [19], though the\r
dimension of relevant minimal surfaces is different.\r
We will work in the Poincare metric for AdSd+2\r

this case the minimal surface is defined by\r

From these results, the entanglement entropy can be\r
calculated by Eq. (1.5). Each of (3.2) and (3.3) has a\r
UV divergent term ∼ a\r
−d+1 that is proportional to the\r
area of the boundary ∂A. This agrees with the known\r
‘area law’ of the entanglement entropy in quantum field\r
theories [5, 6]. Note that this ‘area law’ is related to ours\r
Eq. (1.5) via the basic property of holography.\r
We may prefer a physical quantity that is independent\r
of the cutoff (i.e. universal). The second term in Eq. (3.2)\r
has this property. In general, when A is a finite size, there\r
is a universal and conformal invariant constant contribu\u0002tion to SA if d is even (see [20] for properties of minimal\r
surfaces in AdS). In (2+1)D topological field theories the\r
constant contribution to SA encodes the quantum dimen\u0002sion and is called the topological entanglement entropy\r
[8, 9]. If d is odd, the coefficient of the logarithmic term\r
∼ log(l/a) is universal as in Eq. (1.3).\r
Let us apply the previous results to a specific string\r
theory setup. Type IIB string on AdS5 × S\r

is dual to

4\r
4D N = 4 SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory [2]. The\r

It is interesting to compare the finite universal term in\r
Eq. (3.4) with the field theory one. For free real scalars\r
and fermions in general dimensions, one way to com\u0002pute SAS\r
is presented in [21] (see also [22]). Indeed,\r
this leads to the same behavior in a and l as in Eq.\r
(3.4). Following this approach, we can estimate finite\r
contributions from 6 scalars and 4 Majorana fermions in\r
the N = 4 Yang-Mills multiplet. In the end, we obtain\r
S\r
f reeCF T\r
f inite ∼ −(0.068 + g) · N2L\r
2/l2\r
, where g is the con\u0002tribution from the gauge field (g = 0.010 if we treat the\r
gauge field as 2 scalars). On the other hand, our AdS5\r
result (3.4) leads to S\r
AdS\r
f inite ∼ −0.051 · N2L\r

. We may\r
think this is a good agreement if we remember that the\r
gravity description corresponds to the strongly coupled\r
gauge theory instead of the free theory as in [23].\r

IV. YANG-MILLS AT FINITE TEMPERATURE\r
As the final example, we discuss the N = 4 super Yang\u0002Mills theory on R\r
3 at a finite temperature T , which is\r
dual to the AdS black hole defined by the metric [24]\r

Eq. (4.2) contains the UV divergence ∼ a\r

As in the analogous computation of Wilson loops [25], we\r
also expect a term which is proportional to the area of\r
A. Indeed, when l is large (u∗ ∼ u0) we find the constant\r
term ∼ π\r

× (Area of AS).\r
(4.3)\r
We can regard this entropy as a part of the Bekenstein\u0002Hawking entropy of black 5-branes [23], which is propor\u0002tional to the area of horizon situated at u = u0. Thus we\r
can interpret the part (4.3) as a thermal entropy contri\u0002bution to the total entanglement entropy at finite tem\u0002perature. In our gravitational description, this part arises\r
because the minimal surface wraps a part of the black\r
hole horizon (Fig. 3 (a)). If we expand the size of A until\r
it coincides with the total system (in the global coordi\u0002nate), γA wraps the horizon completely and SA becomes\r
equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as expected.\r
In a sense, the overall normalization in Eq. (1.5) is fixed\r
from Eq. (1.1) once we consider the entanglement entropy\r
at finite temperature. Note that at finite temperature,\r
SA = SB does not hold generically. In the present situ\u0002ation, this occurs because the surfaces γA and γB wrap\r
two different parts of the horizon (Fig. 3 (b)).\r
As argued in [13, 26], the AdS black hole can be dual to\r
an entanglement of two different CFTs at the two bound\u0002aries. It is interesting to look at the minimal surfaces that\r
connect them. As a specific limit, we may think the black\r
hole entropy is the same as the entanglement entropy of\r
the CFTs as the minimal surface wrap the horizon.\r
V. CONCLUSION\r
In this paper we proposed a holographic description of\r
the entanglement entropy in quantum (conformal) field\r
theories via AdSd+2/CFTd+1 correspondence. This is\r
summarized as the area law relation (1.5). Based on\r
our proposal we computed the entanglement entropy for\r
various systems, e.g. 2D CFTs and the 4D large-N N =\r
4 super Yang-Mills theory. We checked that in the lowest\r
dimensional case (d = 1), our formula exactly coincides\r
with the entropy computed directly from CFT.

5\r
In higher dimensions (d ≥ 2), a quantitative compar\u0002ison is not easy because the gravity description corre\u0002sponds to the strongly coupled gauge theory whose entan\u0002glement entropy is not known at present. Nevertheless,\r
we found that our computation for AdS5 ×S\r
5\r
reproduces\r
the same functional form of entanglement entropy as the\r
one in the 4D free N = 4 super Yang-Mills. Their nu\u0002merical coefficients only differ by a factor ∼ 3\r
2\r
in a rough\r
estimation (assuming that the gauge field contribution is\r
the same as that of two real scalar fields). This is similar\r
to the well-known result of the thermal entropy [23].\r
Finally we computed the entanglement entropy at fi\u0002nite temperature employing AdS black hole geometry. In\r
this case the minimal surface wraps a fraction of the black\r
hole horizon and this part is responsible for the thermal\r
contribution.\r
