p–Adic pseudodifferential operators\r
and p–adic wavelets\r
S.V.Kozyrev\r
November 10, 2018\r
Abstract\r
We introduce a new wide class of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. We\r
show that the basis of p–adic wavelets is the basis of eigenvectors for the\r
introduced operators.\r
1 Introduction\r
In the present paper we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators, which\r
generate p–adic diffusions. The constructed operators, unlike the Vladimirov op\u0002erator of p–adic fractional derivation [1], will not be diagonalizable by the Fourier\r
transform. These operators will be diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets, intro\u0002duced in [2]. Therefore we will call these operators non translationally invariant\r
(i.e., non commutative with the operators of shift).\r
In the present paper we consider only the problem of existence of the mentioned\r
operators. To show that the introduced operators T generate diffusions, one has\r
to show that the corresponding evolutions e\r
−tT exist, conserve the cone of positive\r
functions and the total number of particles. Formally these conditions are satisfied,\r
the rigorous proof will be considered elsewhere.\r
Ultrametric diffusions were considered in [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [7], [8], [9]\r
ultrametric diffusions were applied for description of the relaxation processes in\r
disordered systems, for instance, in spin glasses and proteins. In the present paper\r
we describe diffusions with more general generators, compared to the considered in\r
the mentioned above literature.\r
The field of p–adic numbers is the simplest example of an ultrametric space. p–\r
Adic mathematical physics, see [1]–[16], studies the models of mathematical physics\r
with the help of p–adic analysis.\r
The results of the present paper have the following physical applications.\r
In the works [7], [14] p–adic analysis was applied to describe the replica sym\u0002metry breaking, for discussion of the replica approach see [19]. It was shown that\r
the Parisi matrix describing the replica symmetry breaking (before the n → 0 limit)\r
is a discrete analogue of a p–adic pseudofifferential operator. In the present paper\r
1

we introduce a new family of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. The discrete ana\u0002logues of the introduced operators will be the new examples of the replica matrices.\r
The application of these replica matrices to disordered models (for which the n → 0\r
limit for the introduced operators have to be developed) would be an interesting\r
problem.\r
Another possible application of the approach of the present paper is the appli\u0002cation to random walk on hierarchical landscapes of energy, relaxation phenomena\r
in complex systems and basin to basin kinetics, see [22] – [25], [26].\r
The structure of the present paper is as follows.\r
In Section 2 we remind some results from p–adic analysis and describe the basis\r
of p–adic wavelets.\r
In Section 3 we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators and prove\r
that these operators are diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets.\r
In Section 4 we discuss in more details some particular examples of pseudodif\u0002ferential operators and compute the asymptotics of population of unit disk for the\r
corresponding ultrametric diffusion.\r
In Section 5 we in more details discuss the possible physical applications of the\r
results of the present paper.\r
2 p–Adic analysis\r
Remind some notations used in p–adic analysis, see [1] for details.\r
An ultrametric space is a metric space with the metrics k· k satisfying the strong\r
triangle inequality\r
kxyk ≤ max(kxzk, kyzk), ∀z\r
The simplest example of ultrametric space is the field Qp of p–adic numbers.\r
The field Qp of p–adic numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers\r
Q with respect to p–adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way.\r
An arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = p\r
γ m\r
n with m and\r
n not divisible by p. The p–adic norm of the rational number x = p\r
γ m\r
n\r
is equal to\r
|x|p = p\r
−γ\r
. The strong triangle inequality for p–adic numbers takes the form\r
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p, |y|p).\r
p–Adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with the (convergent in p–adic\r
norm) series of the form\r
x =\r
X∞\r
γ=γ0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1 (1)\r
The ring Zp of p–adic integers contains p–adic numbers of the form\r
x =\r
X∞\r
γ=0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1\r
2

and the group Qp/Zp we identify with the set containing fractions\r
x =\r
X−1\r
γ=γ0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1\r
The Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation is defined as follows [1]\r
D\r
α\r
f(x) = 1\r
Γp(−α)\r
Z\r
Qp\r
f(x) − f(y)\r
|x − y|\r
1+α\r
p\r
dy (2)\r
where dy is the Haar measure on Qp and Γp(−α) is a constant. This operator is\r
diagonalizable by the p–adic Fourier transform F:\r
D\r
α\r
f(x) = F\r
−1\r
◦ |k|\r
α\r
p\r
◦ F f(x)\r
p–Adic wavelets were introduced in [2], where the following theorem was proven.\r
Theorem. The set of functions {ψγjn}:\r
ψγjn(x) = p\r
−\r
γ\r
2 χ(p\r
γ−1\r
jx)Ω(|p\r
γx−n|p), γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Qp/Zp, j = 1, . . . , p−1 (3)\r
is an orthonormal basis in L\r
2\r
(Qp) of eigenvectors of the operator Dα:\r
D\r
αψγjn = pα(1−γ)ψγjn (4)\r
Here Ω(x) is the indicator of the interval [0, 1], which implies for the characteristic\r
function of p–adic disk the expression\r
Ω(|x|p) = (\r
1, |x|p ≤ 1 ,\r
0, |x|p > 1 .\r
The function χ(x) is the complex valued character of the p–adic argument which for\r
x given by (1) is defined as\r
χ(x) = exp 2πi X−1\r
γ=γ0\r
xip\r
i\r
!\r
The theorem above shows that the p–adic wavelets are the basis of eigenvectors\r
for the operator (2). The operator (2), see [1], was considered as the generator of\r
the ultrametric diffusion. In the present paper we introduce a more general class\r
of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. These operators can not be diagonalized by\r
the p–adic Fourier transform, but we will show, that the introduced operators are\r
still diagonalizable by the p–adic wavelet transform (i.e. the p–adic wavelets are\r
eigenvectors of the introduced operators).\r
p–Adic numbers are related to the Bruhat–Tits trees, see [27]. The Bruhat–Tits\r
tree is the infinite tree (with the infinite number of edges and vertices) where each\r
vertex is connected with exactly p + 1 over vertices. p–Adic projective line, which\r
3

contains the field of p–adic numbers plus one infinite point, is equivalent to the\r
space of classes of equivalence of semiinfinite paths in the Bruhat–Tits tree. Two\r
(semiinfinite) paths are equivalent if they coincide, starting from some vertex. For\r
instance, the set of semiinfinite paths going through the fixed vertex and through p\r
edges incident to the vertex is homeomorphic to a p–adic disk.\r
This construction is the analogue of the Poincare model of the Lobachevskii\r
plane, where the Bruhat–Tits tree is the analogue of the Lobachevskii plane, the\r
p–adic (projective) line is the analogue of the absolute, and the (unique) path in\r
the Bruhat–Tits tree connecting x and y in Qp is the analogue of the geodesic line\r
connecting the points at the absolute.\r
We introduce the level, or height of the vertex, in the following way. We put in\r
correspondence to every vertex in the Bruhat–Tits tree the p–adic disk, correspond\u0002ing to the following set of semiinfinite paths in the tree which begin in the vertex.\r
This set contains all the paths going through the p of p + 1 edges incident to the\r
vertex (excluding one edge incident to the path going through the infinite point of\r
the absolute). We call the level of the vertex the logp of the radius of this disk.\r
For two points x, y in Qp there exists the unique path in the Bruhat–Tits tree\r
connecting these two points. This path contains the unique point A(x, y) with the\r
highest level.\r
3 Construction of the pseudodifferential opera\u0002tors\r
In [28], [29] examples of ultrametric diffusions on a discrete set were considered. In\r
[1], [3], [4]–[6], [8]–[9] examples of p–adic diffusions were investigated.\r
In the present section we introduce a family of p–adic pseudodifferential opera\u0002tors, which generate ultrametric diffusions on the field Qp of p–adic numbers. The\r
existence of corresponding diffusions (possibility to take the exponent of the gener\u0002ator) will not be discussed in the present paper. The introduced pseudodifferential\r
operators will be the generalizations of the Vladimirov operator.\r
Consider the operator\r
T f(x) = ZT(x, y)(f(x) − f(y))dy (5)\r
Here we take x, y lying in the field Qp of p–adic numbers. We consider the operator\r
T as the operator in the space L\r
2\r
(Qp) of complex valued square integrable functions\r
of p–adic argument.\r
In the following we will introduce some conditions for the kernel T(x, y). Opera\u0002tor of the form (5) satisfying these conditions we call the generator of the ultrametric\r
diffusion. We show that under these conditions the operator (5) will be diagonal in\r
the basis of p–adic wavelets, introduced in [2]. This means that the assumption of\r
ultrametricity of the diffusion makes the problem of investigation of the diffusion\r
exactly solvable.\r
4

Definition 1. We call the transition probability (and the corresponding diffu\u0002sion with the generator given by (5)) ultrametric, if the transition probability T(x, y)\r
depends only on the highest point A(x, y) lying at the path between x and y in the\r
Bruhat–Tits tree.\r
Notice that the transition probability T(x, y) is symmetric with respect to x, y\r
and satisfies the following property:\r
Lemma 2. The function T(x, y) is symmetric and positive with respect to y,\r
and, for fixed x, is locally constant with respect to y outside any vicinity of x.\r
Moreover, for fixed x, the following condition is satisfied:\r
T(x, y) = const , if |x − y|p = const (6)\r
Vice versa, when the condition (6) is satisfied, the function T(x, y) satisfies the\r
conditions of Definition 1.\r
It is easy to see that the Vladimirov operator and similar operators with trans\u0002lationally invariant kernels T(x, y) (which depend only on the diference x − y and\r
therefore, under the corresponding conditions of integrability of the kernel, can be\r
diagonalized by the Fourier transform), satisfy the conditions of lemma 2. In the\r
present paper we introduce the examples of the generators with non translationally\r
invariant kernels.\r
The following theorem gives the general form of the kernel for the operator (5).\r
Theorem 3. The function of the form\r
T(x, y) = X\r
γn\r
T\r
(γn)\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|pΩ(|p\r
γx − n|p) (7)\r
where T\r
(γn) ≥ 0, γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Qp/Zp satisfies the conditions of lemma 2.\r
Moreover, an arbitrary function satisfying (6) can be represented in the form\r
(7).\r
Proof Positivity of T(x, y) is obvious.\r
Let us prove the symmetricity of T(x, y). We have\r
T(x, y) − T(y, x) = X\r
γn\r
T\r
(γn)\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p\r
(Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p) − Ω(|pγ\r
y − n|p)) (8)\r
Let us prove that this expression is equal identically to zero. Consider the case when\r
x is such that the following characteristic function is non–zero:\r
Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p) = 1\r
This implies\r
|x − p\r
−γn|p ≤ pγ\r
(9)\r
If\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p 6= 0\r
5

then\r
|x − y|p = p\r
γ\r
(10)\r
Formulas (9), (10) and ultrametricity imply that\r
Ω(|p\r
γ\r
y − n|p) = 1\r
Therefore the corresponding terms in (8) cancel. This proves that T(x, y) given by\r
(7) is symmetric.\r
Prove that T(x, y) given by (7) satisfies (6). Fix x ∈ Qp. Then for y lying at the\r
sphere with the center in x and the radius p\r
γ we have\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p = 1\r
and\r
Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p)\r
will be equal to 0 or 1 depending on whether p\r
−γn lies in the disk\r
{y : |x − y|p ≤ p\r
γ\r
}\r
or no. Therefore T(x, y) will be a constant on the considered sphere and (6) will be\r
satisfied.\r
This proves that T(x, y) satisfying the conditions of the present lemma will satisfy\r
lemma 2.\r
Vice versa, it is easy to see that the kernel (7) for x, y lying in the disk with the\r
center in p\r
−γn and the radius pγ\r
, and satisfying |x − y|p = p\r
γ\r
, takes the value T\r
(γn)\r
.\r
Since all the space x, y ∈ Qp × Qp is the disjoint union of such a subsets, there\u0002fore, taking an arbitrary positive T\r
(γn) we are able to construct an arbitrary kernel\r
satisfying (6). This finishes the proof of the theorem.\r
In the next theorem we compute the eigenvalues of the generator of ultrametric\r
diffusion.\r
Theorem 4. Let the kernel (6) satisfy the condition of convergence of all the\r
integrals in (12) for any γ, n. Then the operator (5) is a well defined operator in\r
L\r
2\r
(Qp) with the dense domain and the p–adic wavelets ψγjn are eigenvectors for the\r
ultrametric diffusion:\r
T ψγjn = λγnψγjn (11)\r

T(p\r
−γn, y)dy + pγT(p−γn, p−γ\r
(n + 1)) (12)\r
Proof To prove the present theorem we use Lemma 2. Consider the wavelet ψγjn.\r
Then\r
T ψγjn(x) = ZT(x, y) (ψγjn(x) − ψγjn(y)) dy\r
6

Consider the following cases.\r
1) Let |p\r
γx − n|p > 1. Then Lemma 2 implies\r
T ψγjn(x) = ZT(x, y)ψγjn(x)dy − T(x, n)\r
Z\r
ψγjn(y)dy = 0\r
2) Let |p\r

which gives (12).\r
Therefore the operator T is well defined on the basis in L\r
2\r
(Qp) that finishes the\r
proof of the theorem. Note that convergence of all the integrals used in the proof is\r
guaranteed by convergence of (12).\r
The next corollary gives a simple representation for the eigenvalues of the gen\u0002erator with the kernel (7).\r

X\r

g (|n − n0|p) Ω (|x − n|p) = g (|x − n0|p) (1−Ω (|x − n0|p))+g(0)Ω (|x − n0|p)\r

5 Conclusion\r
In the present paper we construct the new family of p–adic pseudodifferential oper\u0002ators T and show that these operators are diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets.\r
This allows to compute analytically the corresponding evolutions e\r
−tT\r
.\r
The approach of the present paper may be applied to the problem of investiga\u0002tion of the diffusion on hierarchical energy landscapes. The concept of hierarchical\r
energy landscape attracts a lot of interest in connection with investigation of com\u0002plex systems, in particular, glasses, clusters, and proteins [17]-[26]. Discuss this\r
concept using the language of basis to basis kinetics [26]. In the framework of this\r
concept a complex system is assumed to have a large number of metastable configu\u0002rations, corresponding to local minima of energy. The local minima are clustered in\r
hierarchically nested basins of minima, namely, each large basin consists of smaller\r
basins, each of these consisting of even smaller ones, and so on. In the other words,\r
the hierarchy of basins possesses ultrametric geometry. Finally, the basins of min\u0002ima are separated from one another by a hierarchically arranged set of barriers, i.e.,\r
high barriers separate large basins, and smaller basins within each larger one are\r
separated by lower barriers.\r
The concept of hierarchical energy landscape may be considered as a kind of\r
approximation of a complex energy landscape by a hierarchical energy landscape.\r
The dynamics of the system with hierarchical energy landscape it is natural to\r
describe by the models of ultrametric diffusion.\r
11

It is commonly recognized that relevant analytical tools should be developed for\r
applying the concept of hierarchical energy landscape to the description of relaxation\r
phenomena in complex systems [22] – [25], [26] (the concept of “basin–to–basin\r
kinetics”).\r
The present paper is devoted to the development of these analytical tools. We\r
show, that for some wide class of ultrametric diffusions the corresponding generators\r
(p–adic pseudodifferential operators) may be diagonalized in the basis of p–adic\r
wavlets, introduced in [2]. This means that the random walk on the corresponding\r
energy landscape may be investigated analytically.\r

p–Adic pseudodifferential operators\r

Abstract\r
We introduce a new wide class of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. We\r
show that the basis of p–adic wavelets is the basis of eigenvectors for the\r
introduced operators."""

In the present paper we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators, which\r
generate p–adic diffusions. The constructed operators, unlike the Vladimirov op\u0002erator of p–adic fractional derivation [1], will not be diagonalizable by the Fourier\r
transform. These operators will be diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets, intro\u0002duced in [2]. Therefore we will call these operators non translationally invariant\r
(i.e., non commutative with the operators of shift).\r
In the present paper we consider only the problem of existence of the mentioned\r
operators. To show that the introduced operators T generate diffusions, one has\r
to show that the corresponding evolutions e\r
−tT exist, conserve the cone of positive\r
functions and the total number of particles. Formally these conditions are satisfied,\r
the rigorous proof will be considered elsewhere.\r
Ultrametric diffusions were considered in [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In [7], [8], [9]\r
ultrametric diffusions were applied for description of the relaxation processes in\r
disordered systems, for instance, in spin glasses and proteins. In the present paper\r
we describe diffusions with more general generators, compared to the considered in\r
the mentioned above literature.\r
The field of p–adic numbers is the simplest example of an ultrametric space. p–\r
Adic mathematical physics, see [1]–[16], studies the models of mathematical physics\r
with the help of p–adic analysis.\r
The results of the present paper have the following physical applications.\r
In the works [7], [14] p–adic analysis was applied to describe the replica sym\u0002metry breaking, for discussion of the replica approach see [19]. It was shown that\r
the Parisi matrix describing the replica symmetry breaking (before the n → 0 limit)\r
is a discrete analogue of a p–adic pseudofifferential operator. In the present paper\r
1

we introduce a new family of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. The discrete ana\u0002logues of the introduced operators will be the new examples of the replica matrices.\r
The application of these replica matrices to disordered models (for which the n → 0\r
limit for the introduced operators have to be developed) would be an interesting\r
problem.\r
Another possible application of the approach of the present paper is the appli\u0002cation to random walk on hierarchical landscapes of energy, relaxation phenomena\r
in complex systems and basin to basin kinetics, see [22] – [25], [26].\r
The structure of the present paper is as follows.\r
In Section 2 we remind some results from p–adic analysis and describe the basis\r
of p–adic wavelets.\r
In Section 3 we introduce the family of pseudodifferential operators and prove\r
that these operators are diagonal in the basis of p–adic wavelets.\r
In Section 4 we discuss in more details some particular examples of pseudodif\u0002ferential operators and compute the asymptotics of population of unit disk for the\r
corresponding ultrametric diffusion.\r
In Section 5 we in more details discuss the possible physical applications of the\r
results of the present paper.\r
2 p–Adic analysis\r
Remind some notations used in p–adic analysis, see [1] for details.\r
An ultrametric space is a metric space with the metrics k· k satisfying the strong\r
triangle inequality\r
kxyk ≤ max(kxzk, kyzk), ∀z\r
The simplest example of ultrametric space is the field Qp of p–adic numbers.\r
The field Qp of p–adic numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers\r
Q with respect to p–adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way.\r
An arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = p\r
γ m\r
n with m and\r
n not divisible by p. The p–adic norm of the rational number x = p\r
γ m\r
n\r
is equal to\r
|x|p = p\r
−γ\r
. The strong triangle inequality for p–adic numbers takes the form\r
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p, |y|p).\r
p–Adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with the (convergent in p–adic\r
norm) series of the form\r
x =\r
X∞\r
γ=γ0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1 (1)\r
The ring Zp of p–adic integers contains p–adic numbers of the form\r
x =\r
X∞\r
γ=0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1\r

and the group Qp/Zp we identify with the set containing fractions\r
x =\r
X−1\r
γ=γ0\r
xip\r
i\r
, xi = 0, . . . , p − 1\r
The Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation is defined as follows [1]\r

where dy is the Haar measure on Qp and Γp(−α) is a constant. This operator is\r
diagonalizable by the p–adic Fourier transform F:\r

p–Adic wavelets were introduced in [2], where the following theorem was proven.\r

D\r
αψγjn = pα(1−γ)ψγjn (4)\r
Here Ω(x) is the indicator of the interval [0, 1], which implies for the characteristic\r
function of p–adic disk the expression\r
Ω(|x|p) = (\r
1, |x|p ≤ 1 ,\r
0, |x|p > 1 .\r
The function χ(x) is the complex valued character of the p–adic argument which for\r
x given by (1) is defined as\r
χ(x) = exp 2πi X−1\r
γ=γ0\r

The theorem above shows that the p–adic wavelets are the basis of eigenvectors\r
for the operator (2). The operator (2), see [1], was considered as the generator of\r
the ultrametric diffusion. In the present paper we introduce a more general class\r
of p–adic pseudodifferential operators. These operators can not be diagonalized by\r
the p–adic Fourier transform, but we will show, that the introduced operators are\r
still diagonalizable by the p–adic wavelet transform (i.e. the p–adic wavelets are\r
eigenvectors of the introduced operators).\r
p–Adic numbers are related to the Bruhat–Tits trees, see [27]. The Bruhat–Tits\r
tree is the infinite tree (with the infinite number of edges and vertices) where each\r
vertex is connected with exactly p + 1 over vertices. p–Adic projective line, which\r
3

contains the field of p–adic numbers plus one infinite point, is equivalent to the\r
space of classes of equivalence of semiinfinite paths in the Bruhat–Tits tree. Two\r
(semiinfinite) paths are equivalent if they coincide, starting from some vertex. For\r
instance, the set of semiinfinite paths going through the fixed vertex and through p\r
edges incident to the vertex is homeomorphic to a p–adic disk.\r
This construction is the analogue of the Poincare model of the Lobachevskii\r
plane, where the Bruhat–Tits tree is the analogue of the Lobachevskii plane, the\r
p–adic (projective) line is the analogue of the absolute, and the (unique) path in\r
the Bruhat–Tits tree connecting x and y in Qp is the analogue of the geodesic line\r
connecting the points at the absolute.\r
We introduce the level, or height of the vertex, in the following way. We put in\r
correspondence to every vertex in the Bruhat–Tits tree the p–adic disk, correspond\u0002ing to the following set of semiinfinite paths in the tree which begin in the vertex.\r
This set contains all the paths going through the p of p + 1 edges incident to the\r
vertex (excluding one edge incident to the path going through the infinite point of\r
the absolute). We call the level of the vertex the logp of the radius of this disk.\r
For two points x, y in Qp there exists the unique path in the Bruhat–Tits tree\r
connecting these two points. This path contains the unique point A(x, y) with the\r
highest level."""

text = """
In [28], [29] examples of ultrametric diffusions on a discrete set were considered. In\r
[1], [3], [4]–[6], [8]–[9] examples of p–adic diffusions were investigated.\r
In the present section we introduce a family of p–adic pseudodifferential opera\u0002tors, which generate ultrametric diffusions on the field Qp of p–adic numbers. The\r
existence of corresponding diffusions (possibility to take the exponent of the gener\u0002ator) will not be discussed in the present paper. The introduced pseudodifferential\r
operators will be the generalizations of the Vladimirov operator.\r
Consider the operator\r
T f(x) = ZT(x, y)(f(x) − f(y))dy (5)\r
Here we take x, y lying in the field Qp of p–adic numbers. We consider the operator\r
T as the operator in the space L\r
2\r
(Qp) of complex valued square integrable functions\r
of p–adic argument.\r
In the following we will introduce some conditions for the kernel T(x, y). Opera\u0002tor of the form (5) satisfying these conditions we call the generator of the ultrametric\r
diffusion. We show that under these conditions the operator (5) will be diagonal in\r
the basis of p–adic wavelets, introduced in [2]. This means that the assumption of\r
ultrametricity of the diffusion makes the problem of investigation of the diffusion\r
exactly solvable.\r
4

Definition 1. We call the transition probability (and the corresponding diffu\u0002sion with the generator given by (5)) ultrametric, if the transition probability T(x, y)\r
depends only on the highest point A(x, y) lying at the path between x and y in the\r
Bruhat–Tits tree.\r
Notice that the transition probability T(x, y) is symmetric with respect to x, y\r
and satisfies the following property:\r
Lemma 2. The function T(x, y) is symmetric and positive with respect to y,\r
and, for fixed x, is locally constant with respect to y outside any vicinity of x.\r
Moreover, for fixed x, the following condition is satisfied:\r
T(x, y) = const , if |x − y|p = const (6)\r
Vice versa, when the condition (6) is satisfied, the function T(x, y) satisfies the\r
conditions of Definition 1.\r
It is easy to see that the Vladimirov operator and similar operators with trans\u0002lationally invariant kernels T(x, y) (which depend only on the diference x − y and\r
therefore, under the corresponding conditions of integrability of the kernel, can be\r
diagonalized by the Fourier transform), satisfy the conditions of lemma 2. In the\r
present paper we introduce the examples of the generators with non translationally\r
invariant kernels.\r
The following theorem gives the general form of the kernel for the operator (5).\r
Theorem 3. The function of the form\r
T(x, y) = X\r
γn\r
T\r
(γn)\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|pΩ(|p\r
γx − n|p) (7)\r
where T\r
(γn) ≥ 0, γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Qp/Zp satisfies the conditions of lemma 2.\r
Moreover, an arbitrary function satisfying (6) can be represented in the form\r
(7).\r
Proof Positivity of T(x, y) is obvious.\r
Let us prove the symmetricity of T(x, y). We have\r
T(x, y) − T(y, x) = X\r
γn\r
T\r
(γn)\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p\r
(Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p) − Ω(|pγ\r
y − n|p)) (8)\r
Let us prove that this expression is equal identically to zero. Consider the case when\r
x is such that the following characteristic function is non–zero:\r
Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p) = 1\r
This implies\r
|x − p\r
−γn|p ≤ pγ\r
(9)\r
If\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p 6= 0\r
5

then\r
|x − y|p = p\r
γ\r
(10)\r
Formulas (9), (10) and ultrametricity imply that\r
Ω(|p\r
γ\r
y − n|p) = 1\r
Therefore the corresponding terms in (8) cancel. This proves that T(x, y) given by\r
(7) is symmetric.\r
Prove that T(x, y) given by (7) satisfies (6). Fix x ∈ Qp. Then for y lying at the\r
sphere with the center in x and the radius p\r
γ we have\r
δ1,|p\r
γx−pγy|p = 1\r
and\r
Ω(|p\r
γx − n|p)\r
will be equal to 0 or 1 depending on whether p\r
−γn lies in the disk\r
{y : |x − y|p ≤ p\r
γ\r
}\r
or no. Therefore T(x, y) will be a constant on the considered sphere and (6) will be\r
satisfied.\r
This proves that T(x, y) satisfying the conditions of the present lemma will satisfy\r
lemma 2.\r
Vice versa, it is easy to see that the kernel (7) for x, y lying in the disk with the\r
center in p\r
−γn and the radius pγ\r
, and satisfying |x − y|p = p\r
γ\r
, takes the value T\r
(γn)\r
.\r
Since all the space x, y ∈ Qp × Qp is the disjoint union of such a subsets, there\u0002fore, taking an arbitrary positive T\r
(γn) we are able to construct an arbitrary kernel\r
satisfying (6). This finishes the proof of the theorem.\r
In the next theorem we compute the eigenvalues of the generator of ultrametric\r
diffusion.\r
Theorem 4. Let the kernel (6) satisfy the condition of convergence of all the\r
integrals in (12) for any γ, n. Then the operator (5) is a well defined operator in\r
L\r
2\r
(Qp) with the dense domain and the p–adic wavelets ψγjn are eigenvectors for the\r

The approach of the present paper may be applied to the problem of investiga\u0002tion of the diffusion on hierarchical energy landscapes. The concept of hierarchical\r
energy landscape attracts a lot of interest in connection with investigation of com\u0002plex systems, in particular, glasses, clusters, and proteins [17]-[26]. Discuss this\r
concept using the language of basis to basis kinetics [26]. In the framework of this\r
concept a complex system is assumed to have a large number of metastable configu\u0002rations, corresponding to local minima of energy. The local minima are clustered in\r
hierarchically nested basins of minima, namely, each large basin consists of smaller\r
basins, each of these consisting of even smaller ones, and so on. In the other words,\r
the hierarchy of basins possesses ultrametric geometry. Finally, the basins of min\u0002ima are separated from one another by a hierarchically arranged set of barriers, i.e.,\r
high barriers separate large basins, and smaller basins within each larger one are\r
separated by lower barriers.\r
The concept of hierarchical energy landscape may be considered as a kind of\r
approximation of a complex energy landscape by a hierarchical energy landscape.\r
The dynamics of the system with hierarchical energy landscape it is natural to\r
