EMBEDDING OF SOME FINITE GEOMETRIES\r
INTO RIEMANN SURFACES\r
by Pablo Martm Garcia\r
In this thesis we provide examples of a new approach to the field of finite geometries,\r
namely by considering the conformal embedding of a hnite geometry into a Riemann\r
surface. A hnite geometry is a particular arrangement of a finite number of points\r
and lines satisfying some well known axioms. We will cover the hrst two examples\r
of the family of Hadamard designs, which are the Fano plane and the 3-biplane.\r
Riemann surfaces and dessins are introduced and explained in chapter one. We\r
explore their common relationship to cocompact Puchsian groups and display some\r
results regarding the calculation of their automorphisms groups. We also describe\r
the three most common geometric representations of a dessin: those by Cori, James\r
and Walsh.\r
Chapter two is divided into two different parts. In the first one we cover the\r
family of finite groups PSL{2,p) where p is a prime number, particularly for the\r
cases where p e {5, 7,11}. In the second part of the chapter we introduce the family\r
of Hecke groups H'^ and their special congruence subgroups, with special regards\r
to the cases where g = 3 and g = 5.\r
In chapter three we cover finite geometries and their properties. Projective\r
planes and biplanes are studied in diSFerent sections paying special attention to the\r
Fano plane as our chosen representative for the projective planes and the 3-biplane.\r
Finally in chapter four we make extensive use of aU the preliminar material\r
by finding and describing several conformal embeddings of the Fano plane and\r
the 3-biplane into Riemann surfaces, especially into those Riemann surfaces with\r
automorphism group isomorphic to and that can be uniformized by a\r
special congruence subgroup of H'^.

Preface\r
A map, or more generally a dessin, is a particular arrangement of faces, vertices\r
and edges that have a very rich and widely explored relationship with Riemann\r
surfaces and Puchsian triangle groups. See for example [JSl], [Sch] and [Wal].\r
The theory that originally covered conformal embeddings of maps into Riemann\r
Surfaces, heis been progressively expanded to embrace an ever increasing class of\r
subjects, such as anticonformal embeddings of hypermaps into Klein surfaces and\r
their relationship with N.E.C. triangle groups (see [BS] or [IS]). In chapter one\r
we introduce Riemann surfaces, Fuchsian groups, dessins and some of their prop\u0002erties and relationships, since they constitute the foundation stone of the examples\r
displayed in chapter four.\r
It was first observed by Walsh [Wal] in 1975 that it is possible to embed the\r
incidence relation of the Fano plane as a map into a torus. In 1986 [Si4] Singerman\r
described another embedding of the Fano plane as a regular dessin into a Riemann\r
surface. A regular dessin is one possesing the highest possible symmetry in a surface,\r
and Singerman's embedding proved particularly interesting, since it linked together\r
three well known and widely studied objects: the Fano plane, Klein's quartic and\r
their automorphism groups which are isomorphic to PSL{2,7). Furthermore it\r
is possible to describe the bits of that embedding by means of the cusp set of\r
the action of r(7) on the upper half plane, where r(7) stands for the principal\r
congruence subgroup of level seven of the modular group.\r
All objects highlighted in Singerman's embedding are exceptional on their own\r
rights. Klein's quartic, among other interesting properties, is the Hurwitz surface\r
with the smallest genus (a Hurwitz surface is one that attains Hurwitz's upper\r
iii

bound for the number of automorphisms of a surface, which is 84(p — 1) for ^ > 2)\r
and therefore it is a highly symmetric surface. The Fano plane is the smallest\r
hnite projective plane, and arises as the projective space over the held Z2, while\r
f5'Z,(2,7) enjoys a special status within the f5'Z,(2,p) family that is only shared\r
by f 5'Z,(2,5) and f 5'i,(2,11) as it was proven in a result due to Evariste Galois.\r
What we have done is to fully explore what we considered to be the parallel case\r
to the Fano plane embedding described by D. Singerman, Ending some intriguing\r
and beautiful relationships on our way. Since Singerman's embedding fully covers\r
f6'Z,(2,7), we have been guided by the idea of exploring the remaining case in\r
Galois' result, which is f5'i,(2,11), Ending objects that relate to each other in a\r
similar way to those involved with f6'jL(2,7). As a starting point for our work,\r
I have to acknowledge a very inspirational paper by Konstant: T/ie prap/i 0/ (Ae\r
truncated /cogo/iedroM amcf (Ae 0/ GaZow' (see [Ko]).\r
Starting then with f5'i,(2,ll) we chose the 3-biplane aa the best candidate\r
for a structure to embed for several reasons. The hrst one is because it is a hnite\r
geometry with automorphism group isomorphic to PSL{2,11), which is a necessary\r
condition and that is fairly similar to the Fano plane. Both of them, the Fano\r
plane and the 3-biplane are the smallest examples of Hadamard designs, and the\r
symmetric arrangement of the 55 Sags structure of the 3-biplane into 11 blocks of\r
5 Sags closely resembles the 21 Sags, 7 blocks of 3 Sags of the Fano plane. On the\r
other hand, there is a clear relationship between the flags set of the 3-biplane and\r
the vertices of a truncated icosahedron (which is basically the relationship between\r
f 5'i^(2,11) and its subgroups isomorphic to /Ig = f ^i,(2, 5)), and that relationship\r
mirrors that of the Fano plane and the truncated cube (which is again that between\r
f5'i^(2,7) and its ^'4 subgroups).\r
In spite of Snding examples of 3-biplane conformal embeddings as a regular\r
iv

dessin, we thought it more appropriate to drop some hypothesis in the embedding in\r
order to And examples with the rich structure underlying Singerman's embedding.\r
Our main example is therefore no longer a dessin, since the components of the\r
complement of the embedded graph in the surface are not simply connected. This\r
is highlighted by the fact that we do not use a triangle group, but a Puchsian group\r
with three periods and signature (1, +, [5,5,11]).\r
When we explore this example we realized that emerges in a natural way\r
to play a role similar to that of in the Fano plane case, further enhancing\r
the singular nature of these two embeddings, since and stand in a class\r
of their own within as the only two Hecke groups with a cusp set equal to\r
Q(Ag) U {c)o}. As a last idea, we use the action of ^^^(4 — \\/5) to describe the Aags\r
of the embedding, and the vertex set of the truncated icosahedron that relates to\r
it.

Chapte r One\r
Riemann Surfaces and Dessins\r
In the first half of this chapter we introduce the concept of Riemann surface\r
and provide some preliminary dehnitions and results. For a broader introduction\r
to Riemann surfaces see either [Mir] or [JS2]. The notion of compact Riemann\r
surface will be explored following two diS'erent but closely related approaches:\r
- as 2-manifolds with an analytic structure,\r
- as the quotient by the action of a cocompact Fuchsian group.\r
Issues related to Fuchsian and NEC groups have also been discussed within\r
the first part of the chapter.\r
In the second half we have examined the general properties of dessins and their\r
conformal embeddings into Riemann surfaces.\r
A more general approach to the subject by substituting Riemann surfaces with\r
Klein surfaces has been outlined, and references to the topic of dessins embedding\r
in Klein surfaces are provided.\r
1.1. Riemann surfaces\r
Roughly, a is a space which, locally, looks like an open set in\r
the complex plane. To make the concept of "looks like" a bit more mathematical,\r
we need to define a c/iorf on a topological space %.\r
A c/iaff on a two dimensional topological space % is a homeomorphism\r
—> v;\r
where (7^ C % is an open set in %, and C C is an open set in the complex plane.\r
The open subset ZTi is called the of the chart We say that the chart

is cenfrecf at p E (Ti if = 0, and it is easy to see that all a chart does is to give\r
local complex coordinates in its domain.\r
As the charts are local homeomorphisms, they can be inverted, and we will call\r
:= o n [/,) ^ H [/,)\r
the /wnctzoM between and . Two charts are compa(%6/e if\r
the transition function between both of them is analytic or if the intersection of their\r
domains is empty. A set of charts : C/i —> %} on A" is called an\r
(also called a compZez on % if is an open cover of % and all the charts\r
in the set are compatible. We will call the charts in an analytic atlas\r
c/iorfs (or compZei\r
It is easy to de6ne an equivalence relation within the atlases of X, two atlases\r
vl and jB are if every chart of one is compatible with every chart of the\r
other, and an equivalence class of analytic atlases is called a comp/ea; a(ruc(wre (or\r
on the surface\r
Definition 1.1.1. A second countable, connected, Hausdorff topological space\r
with a complex structure is called a\r
Although the previous dehnition allows non-compact surfaces, throughout this\r
work we will usually mean a "compact Riemann surface" every time we refer to a\r
Riemann surface.\r
We can induce local orientations around each point of a Riemann surface by\r
"pull-back" of the orientation of the complex plane via a local chart. These local\r
orientations are well defined, independent of the choice of chart in the atlas and\r
they induce a global orientation on the Riemann surface so that the concept of\r
"clockwise" and "anticlockwise" rotation around a point in a Riemann surface is\r
well defined.\r
Given two Riemann surfaces % and Y with complex atlases $ and we can\r
define analytic mappings between % and Y in terms of their charts.\r
Definition 1.1.2, Let X and Y be Riemann surfaces with complex atlases\r
$ = ^ and ^ V}} respectively. We say that the map\r
/ : % —> y is at p E % if there exist analytic charts % with\r
p E and ^ with /(p) E [/j such that 1/;^ o / o is an analytic\r
function at (p).

A map will be analytic in X if and only if it is analytic at every point of X. By\r
deGnition, if a map is analytic at p, it is analytic in a neighbourhood of p. Using\r
similar principles, we can define meromorphic and analytic functions on Riemann\r
surfaces.\r
It is easy to see that the complex plane C admits a complex structure and so\r
is a Riemann surface (although not a compact one). By means of the stereographic\r
projection, the one point compactiScation of C, E = CU{oo} also forms a Riemann\r
surface which is called the Azemann 5^/iere. Analytic and meromorphic functions\r
on a Riemann surface % (in the traditional sense of complex analysis) can be\r
thought of as being analytic mappings from % to C and 2 respectively in the sense\r
of Riemann surfaces.\r
If a Riemann surface locally looks like an open set in the complex plane, there is\r
a more general object, that we will cover for the sake of completeness called a jiT/em\r
auT/oce, for a thorough introduction to Klein surfaces see [AG]. A Klein surface\r
has the property of being locally like an open set in the closed upper half-plane,\r
= {a + 6* : a, 6 E R and 6 > 0}.\r
with the subspace topology that inherits from the usual topology on C.\r
Since there are two different classes of open sets in the upper half plane: those\r
that intersect its boundary, and those that are contained in the interior of the upper\r
half plane, we need to dehne transition functions that cope with this characteristic.\r
We will say that a complex function / is antianalytic (or anticonformat) if\r
d j jdz ~ 0, and / will be called dianalytic if it is either analytic or antianalytic in\r
each connected component of its domain. It is easy to see that a function that is\r
both analytic and antianalytic in the same coimected component of the domain, is\r
constant on that component. We can generalize the concept of analytic chart to\r
that of on a homeomorphism where Ui is an open\r
subset of % and is an open subset of either C or . If is centred at p 6 % and\r
Vi is an open set of but not of C, we will say that p is in the of % (we\r
use to refer to the boundary of %). Two charts will be compofzbJe\r
if their transition functions are dianalytic, and a set of charts : [7^ —> on X\r
is called a on X if is an open cover of % and all the transition\r
functions are dianalytic.

Two dianalytic atlases A and B will be dianalytically equivalent if A U B is\r
a dianalytic atlas (that is, if every chart of one is dianalytically compatible with\r
every chart of the other), and an equivalence class of dianalytic atlases on vY is a\r
on\r
Definition 1.1.3. A 2-manifold X with a dianalytic structure A on X will be\r
called a sur/ace.\r
According to the previous definition, any Riemann surface is in fact a Klein\r
surface, since any analytic atlaa is dianalytic, and any open set of C is homeomorphic\r
to an open set in (C+. To avoid confusion, we will reserve the term "Klein surface"\r
to its traditional meaning, that is, any surface % with a dianalytic structure that is\r
not orientable or has at least one boundary component, and we will use "Riemann\r
surface" to refer to Klein surfaces that are orientable and have no boundary. In\r
general, Klein surfaces will be assumed to be compact. As we have already stated\r
we will mainly study symmetric Riemann surfaces throughout this work.\r
Let / : X ^ y be an analytic map defined at p which is not constant, then\r
(see [Mir]) there is a unique integer m > 1 such that there are local analytic charts\r
and centred at p and /(p) respectively, such that o / o We\r
will call m the of / at p. The multiplicity of a map at one point is\r
independent of the choice of charts, and by taking an element 1/ G Y we can dehne\r
the decree of / at 1/ ag the sum of the multiplicities of / at the points of % mapping\r
to ?/:\r
4(/ ) = ^\r
The degree of / at 1/ is constant, independent of 1/, and so we will just call it\r
the degree of / .\r
Given an analytic function / : % — Y of degree n, there is a hnite set of points\r
C(/) C y so that |/"^(3/)| = M for any ?/ E y — C(/) and 1 < |/^^(i/)| < M for every\r
?/ E C(/), / is then an 6rancAe(f if C(/) ^ 0 and\r
otherwise. The elements of C(/) are called the nafttea or of / ,\r
the elements a; 6 % with multiplicity greater than one are called the\r
or of / , and those with multiplicity one are called\r
Both, the set of critical values and of critical points are finite.

Definition 1.1.4. Two Riemann surfaces X and Y are conformally equivalent\r
or if there exist an analytic bijection / : % —> Y.\r
Propositio n 1.1.5. An analytic map between compact Riemann surfaces is\r
an isomorphism if and only if it has degree one.\r
Proo f See Corollary 4.10 in [Mir].\r
An analytic bijection is called an orientation preserving automor\u0002phism of and the set of all orientation preserving automorphisms of\r
% forms a group under composition. Every Riemann surface is orientable, and we\r
will deEne two diSerent classes of automorphisms, those that preserve orientation\r
(coTi/ormoZ and those that reverse orientation (or\r
The latter being of capital importance when dealing with sym\u0002metric Riemann surfaces.\r
Definition 1.1.6. A Riemann surface R is called symmetric if we can define\r
an anticonformal involution cr :\r
For the cases when ^ is symmetric, we call (or the group of\r
dianalytic automorphisms of J?, it is clear that\r
= 2\r
if R is symmetric and it is 1 otherwise.\r
1.2. Fuchsian groups and NEC groups\r
In this section we will introduce the main features of discrete groups of plane\r
isometries, regarding as a plane 7^ one of the following spaces:\r
# The hyperbolic plane ZV with automorphism group\r
At(t(ZY) = f G'i:(2, R) Ai/t+(&Y) = f ^i;(2, R)\r
# The sphere E, with automorphism group\r
f Gi,(2, C) v4iz(+(E) = f Gi:(2, C)\r
The Euclidean plane C with automorphism group\r
v4%i((C) = A//(1,C) A?it+(C) = A//(1,C).\r

Where the bar above the groups means that we extend their natural action\r
using complex conjugation.\r
In this work we will make the standard abuse of notation and use matrices\r
a b\\ „ ciz + b\r
J I tu\\_oy Xreier tVow Xmaps^ I\r
c d y cz + d\r
and for a 6eld ^ we will call\r

f where A G - {0}\r
(Av)\r
SL{2,K) = ^('^ \\a,b,c,d£K. ad-bc=l (mod fC) j\r
PSL{2,K) =\r
The reason for giving a special consideration to these three Riemann surfaces,\r
will become clear after the following well known theorems:\r
T h e Uniformisatio n Theorem 1.2.1. Every simply connected Riemann\r
surface is conformally equivalent to the hyperbolic plane ZY, the sphere E or the\r
Euclidean plane C.\r
The above theorem is due to F. Klein, H. Poincare and P. Koebe, for a proof\r
using modern notation see [Bea2]. A proof of the theorem below is easily obtained\r
from results in [JS2] §4.19 and §5.7.\r
Theorem 1.2.2. Let A be a compact Riemann surface, then there is a discrete\r
subgroup of (where % is either &/, E or C), acting on % without\r
Exed points, such that ^ is isomorphic to the quotient space\r
Given a group G of plane isometries, we will say that it is Mon if\r
it contains any orientation reversing isometries (if it contains reflections or glide\r
rejections), otherwise G is an one»(a6Ze The set of all the orientation\r
preserving isometries of a given non orientable group G is itself a subgroup of G of\r
index two, and we will usually refer to it as G+. A discrete subgroup of f6'i^(2,R)\r
is called a fbc/isma and a discrete subgroup of A2it+('P) with a compact\r
quotient space (a cocompact group) is a group. CrystaDographic\r
groups may have torsion.\r
6

We can classi^ the elements of (and therefore the elements of any\r
Fuchsian group) by the number of hxed points in ZY, this classihcation can be done\r
in terms of the trace of the matrices.\r
We will say that an element M = ^ f6'Z,(2,R) is\r
- if the action of M Exes two conjugate points in C, one of them is in ZY.\r
We have that tr(M) — |a + < 2.\r
- if the action of M fixes only one point onEu{oo} , |a + d| = 2.\r
- if M 6xes two points in R U {00}, we get that |a + (f| > 2.\r
It is worth thinking of elliptic elements as Enite order rotations about a point\r
in the open upper-half plane, while parabolic elements can be seen as inhnite order\r
rotations about a point in R U {00} and hyperbolic elements as translations in the\r
closed upper-half plane.\r
Any hxed point by a parabolic element of a Puchsian group G is called a cusp\r
(or pom(), and the set of all cusps by elements of G is called the cusp set\r
of G. The number of orbits of the action of G in its cusp set is called the\r
c/oss TZMmter of G.\r
A point a 6 R U {00} is a of a Fuchsian group F if there is a a; E ZY\r
and a sequence ^ = ^1, ^2, - -, - - with 6 F such that the sequence\r
^(a;) = ^yi(a;), ^2(2;),..., . . .\r
converges to a. The set of all hmits points of F is Z'(F), the set of F. Every\r
point a fixed by a parabolic or hyperbolic element of F is a limit point of F. If we\r
call 0(F) = R — L(r) the ordinary set of F, we will say that the Fuchsian group F\r
is of the Amcf if 0(F) is empty, otherwise we will say that F is of the secoMcf\r
If F is of the second kind, then I,(F) is nowhere dense in R. We will only deal\r
with first kind Fuchsian groups.\r
By the uniformisation theorem, we know that for each Riemann surface\r
there is a set of torsion free crystallographic groups = {0^} that uniformize\r
these groups are called stfyyace of and it can be proved that is a\r
class of conjugate groups in At((+(P) so that A is isomorphic to if and only if

A repmn for a crystallographic group G is a closed, connected\r
subset ^ of 7^ such that:\r
- for every point a; E 'P there is a point ^ 6 f such that a; E G?/.\r
• No two points in the interior of F are in the same G orbit.\r
- F is locally hnite, that is, any compact set C C "P intersects only hnitely\r
many images of\r
It is easy to see that if JZ is uniformized by G, and F is a fundamental region\r
for G, then (see for example [JS2] Th. 5.9.6.):\r
%\r
G G'\r
A is a special type of fundamental region whose boundary\r
is a union of geodesic segments that we call the of the polygon. Given any\r
fundamental polygon f and g a side of f then there is precisely one side of f that\r
we call g and one element p E G so that ^(g) — s (it is possible that g = g) and\r
p(f ) is adjacent to f along g. We say that g and g are pozred by\r
Fundamental polygons are very useful to And presentations for subgroups of\r
Puchsian groups by means of a technique known aa Reidemeister-Schreier's method.\r
It can be proved [Bea] that given f a fundamental polygon for the Puchsian group\r
r, the side pairings elements of f generate F, so we can associate to the fundamental\r
polygon f a set of generators for F\r
$ = {A, ,^2, . . . ,/3n}\r
consisting of side pairings elements of f .\r
Suppose that we have a subgroup A < F and we call a whole set of right\r
coset representatives for A in F so that\r
r = |_J Ac,\r
c&CR\r
(U denotes disjoint union), we say that G ^ is a 5'cAre%er (ronauergo/ for A\r
in F if whenever ciCg . . . is a word in $ with cic2 . . . E G;% then we have that\r
C1C2 • • . Cn—\\ E Cji'\r
Once we have a Schreier transversal for A in F, we can describe a set of\r
generators for A. For any element ^ E F there is a unique r E G^ such that\r
Ar = Ap and we call g = r. Then the set\r
B = {r^(r/3)"^ | r E G $ }

generates A and is called a set of 5'c/ire%er for A in P.\r
With a set of Schreier generators and transversals, we can find a presentation\r
for A in P. We assume that F has presentation < % | > and we call\r
^ = {crc"^ |c E r G\r
If we write the elements of ^ in terms of those in ^ and call this new set a\r
presentation for A is given by < B | >.\r
Exampl e 1.2.3. We will calculate a set of Schreier generators for the Puchsian\r
group A = (1; [3,3,7]) inside F = [3,4,7] where T has presentation\r
< A, B, C I = ABC = 1 > .\r
We have that $ — {A, C'} is a set of generators for F while\r
Cj% = {l,A,C,C\\...,CG }\r
constitutes a Schreier transversal for A in F, and we get the following diagram (see\r
Theorem 1.2.5. and Example 1.2.6.)\r

We can now easily calculate the set of Schreier generators, if we delete obvious\r
repetitions, like elements inverses, we get:\r
B\r
and we have that A has presentation < B | >, where A are the relations of F.\r
In order to get a standard presentation for A we might have to consider changing\r
the generators in B by some of its conjugates in A, that has been done in the last\r
section of chapter four, where this particular pair of groups have been considered.

The following result shows how to construct a fundamental polygon for A < F.\r
Theorem 1.2.4. Let A < F be a pair of finitely generated Fuchsian groups\r
such that r has fundamental polygon f and Cj; is a right Schreier transversal for\r
A in r. Then a fundamental polygon for A is\r
f ' = IJ r f\r
rEAc\r
and the sides of f are paired by the Schreier generators corresponding to Ac\u0002Let now ^ — 7^/(7 for some G E then if we call the normaliser of\r
G in we have that (see Theorem 5.9.4. in [JS2]):\r
Aut+(R) =\r
and furthermore, any group of orientation preserving automorphisms of JZ is iso\u0002morphic to for some group so that\r
As we have mentioned before, the group of automorphisms of P contains orien\u0002tation reversing elements as well, so we may consider what happens when we allow\r
orientation reversing elements in the previous theory. Although there is no generic\r
name for a discrete subgroup of A'u(('P) with orientation reversing elements, we will\r
be mainly concerned with crystallographic groups, and in this case we use\r
as an acronym for Non Euclidean Crystallographic, referring to cocompact discrete\r
subgroups of\r
We will follow with groups terminology the same rules already stated for sur\u0002faces, and therefore we will call crystaliographic groups those NEC groups that\r
contain no orientation reversing element, reserving the name proper JVEC ^roup (or\r
just NEC group) for those which do. If G is an NEC group, its coTioMzcaZ\r
is G"*". Since the set of Riemann surfaces arising from the action of\r
Euclidean and spherical groups is very limited in scope (for instance, no surface of\r
genus g > 2 is formed in such a way), we may sometimes use the word "Fuchsian"\r
in a general way to refer to a group that contains no orientation reversing elements,\r
although it may not be a hyperbohc group.\r
10

A Riemann surface R admits an antianalytic involution if the normaliser of\r
G E ill contains orientation reversing elements. If this is the case, we\r
have that:\r
G\r
It is obvious that 7V+(G) = (where we define Ar+(G) := ]V(G)+), and\r
that = ]V(G) if and only if is not symmetric.\r
A special class of crystallographic groups are triangle groups. A (proper\r
is deSned as the group of isometries generated by the rejections on\r
the side of a triangle with angles y, ^ and ^ and is represented by r(/,m, M),\r
which we will usually shorten to ((,m, n) if no confussion arises. We will say that\r
a triangle group is gp/ierzca/, Euc/Weon or if y + ^ ^ is greater than,\r
equal to or smaller than 7r.\r
The canonical Puchsian group of a triangle group, is also called a triangle\r
group, and in that case the group is deEned as the group generated by rotations of\r
order M, m and Z at the vertices of a triangle of angles y, ^ and In general it\r
will be easy to know from the context if we are talking about orientation preserving\r
or reversing groups, and we will use r[/,m, a] to denote a Fuchsian triangle group\r
and a) to denote a proper NEC triangle group.\r
It is clear that:\r
r + (Z, m, = r[Z, m, n].\r
The importance of triangle groups will become apparent in the next section, due\r
to its relationship to the Belyi functions (see [JS3] and [Sch]) and the fundamental\r
groups of maps and hypermaps. We can dehne a triangle group using only algebraic\r
terms as the group with the following presentation:\r
r(/, m, n) = < 27, ?/, z I — 2/^ = = (3:3/)' = = (za;)" — 1 >\r
r[/, m, n] = < a, 6, c I = c" — a6c = 1 >\r
Macbeath and Wilkie proved that for each crystallographic (or NEC) group\r
G with compact quotient space there is a signature and a "marked polygon" from\r
which a canonical presentation for G may be derived, a marA;e(f being a\r
fundamental polygon for G together with the identifications on the boundary of\r
11

F produced by the action of G. See [Wil], [Mac]; the explanation here has been\r
taken from [Wat]. The presentation for G is given by:\r
< Xi, Cjj^, Cjy (ip,bq I Xj ' = Cjf^ = {cjk—icjk) •''' = CjoejCjtjBj = AD = 1 >\r
Where yl = xi-..XrCi...fig, i = l...r, j = k = 0...tj, p=l...g, q = l...h\r
with r > 0, J > 0, > 0, p > 0, E {0,^?}, > 2 , > 2 and:\r
- D = ^ if = ^.\r
• D = a\\...a^g if h ^ g.\r
The numbers are called the proper penodg of the group, while the Mjt's\r
are the ZmA; penodg, and will correspond to the branch points lying inside the\r
quotient space or in its boundary respectively. The quotient space § has genus p\r
and is orientable if A = p and non orientable otherwise. The number of boundary\r
components of the quotient space is g. If s = 0 and there are no proper periods, G\r
is a crystallographic surface group, while if g 0 and there are no proper or link\r
periods, then G is an NEC surface group.\r
Periods (or can be inhnity, in which case the relations of the form\r
= 1 (or = 1) omitted from the presentation. Any hnite order\r
element of G is either conjugate to or to (c^k-iCjk)-^ (for a certain A;,/),\r
therefore if G is a Fuchsian group, all its hnite order elements are conjugate to its\r
elliptic generators.\r
To every presentation (and therefore to every group) we can associate a signa\u0002ture which will be\r
i^Q) 4^; ['^l) • ••) { (^11J •••) (^sl) • • •) '^sts ) })\r
in the orientable case, and\r

in the non-orientable. When r = 3, s = 0 and p = 0 we have the Puchsian triangle\r
group r[??zi, 7712, tTis], while if r = 0, ff = 0, s = 1 and ti = 3, we get the NEC\r
triangle group that we have called r(nii , 7112,^13)-\r
12

Singerman [Si3] determined the hyperbolic area of a fundamental region of a\r
NEC group G. In the orientable case it is:\r
$=1 j =l A;=l\r
while in the non-orientable case is:\r
^ i=l ^ ;= 1A:=1\r
The particular caae of the hrst formula, that covers the case where G does not\r
have any boundary components (s = 0) and therefore no link periods is usually\r
known as It foUows from Theorem 1.2.4. that if Gi is\r
a subgroup of G of index A;, then\r
We will end the present section with a Theorem by David Singerman [Sil]\r
concerning subgroups of Fuchsian groups with hnite index. Although the original\r
theorem is more general, we wiH only use it for cocompact Fuchsian groups. This\r
theorem allows us to work out the signature of the subgroup, given the signature\r
of the big group and the actions of its generators on the cosets of the subgroup. A\r
generalization of it for NEC groups was done by Hoare [Ho].\r

precisely pi other cycles whose lengths are mi/aii, . . .\r

Exampl e 1.2.6. Let G be the group [3,4, 7] with presentation as in Example\r
1.2.3. and consider the map 8 : G —give n by:\r

B^(l,2,5,8)(3,7,6,4 )\r
(1)(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)\r
If we call 8(G) = ^ it is immediate that we are mapping G onto a transitive\r
subgroup of 6"^. 8(^4) has two cycles of length 3 that produce no other periods\r
in f and two cycles of length 1 that produce two 3 periods in F. 8(B) produce\r
no period of F since all its cycles have length 4, on the other hand 8(C) induces\r
a 7 period in F since it has got one cycle of length 1. We have seen that f has\r
signature (p; [3,3,7]) and the condition //(F) = 8//((7) implies that p = 1.\r
1.3. Maps\r
In this section we want to explore the relationship between maps and hyper\u0002maps. We will define maps and hypermaps over Riemann surfaces and explain\r
the geometric and algebraic approach to these objects. A current term, due to\r
Grothendieck, to refer to both maps and hypermaps is "dessin d'enfants" or just\r
deagm. For an introduction to maps theory see [JSl], for a discussion of the wide\r
scope of dessin theory see [Sch].\r
Intuitively, a map is a decomposition of a surface into polygonal two-cells\r
or faces. That leaves a structure on the surface composed by the interior of the\r
polygons (faces), edges and vertices that constitute the map, for an easy example\r
of these we can think of the platonic solids as maps on the surface of the sphere,\r
picture below depicts the map on the sphere induced by a tetrahedron.\r
The set of vertices and edges of the map constitute a graph which is embedded\r
into the surface. Although we will allow a very general class of graph, we will\r
require the graph to be connected and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges, this number is the of the vertex. Our graph can\r
contain edges with one or two vertices, the edges with two vertices correspond to\r
our everyday perception of an edge, as for the edges with only one vertex, they can\r
either be a Zoop or a /ree ecfpe, the difference being that a loop is homeomorphic\r
to a circle, while a free edge is homeomorphic to a segment. Every face would\r
be surrounded by a finite number of edges, and this number is the valency of the\r
14

face, faces should be simply-connected. An oZZoiuecf is a graph satisfying the\r
previous conditions. For a picture of a generic map on a sphere see Fip. 6^\r
6 ^"4 lb'\r
Two o/mapa on (Ae gpAere\r
A Aypergrop/i is a generalization of this idea where we allow any Enite number\r
of vertices to lie on an edge. We will meet some hypergraphs when we describe\r
Enite geometries in chapter three. Our only restriction on the structure of the\r
hypergraph is that it is connected, and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges. We can dehne a Momorp/iigm as a bijection\r
/ between the vertex sets of two (hyper) graphs that induces a bijection between\r
the edges set so that the incidence structure is preserved, that is, if\r
I(P) e f{E)\r
where P is any vertex contained in the edge E.\r
We will start with the topological approach to a map, then describe the al\u0002gebraic structure of it, and use algebraic notions to generalize the concept of map\r
to that of a hypermap. Nevertheless, after the topological and the algebraic ap\u0002proaches have been explained, we will need to provide maps with a richer structure,\r
namely the analytic structure of their underlying Riemann surface.\r
Definition 1.3.1. A map Ai on a compact surface X is an embedding of an\r
allowed graph Q into X such that the components of X — Q are simply-connected.\r
We call the components of % — ^ the /acea of Ai.\r
Definition 1.3.2. A topological map Top{M) is a triple {Q,V,S) where G is\r
an allowed graph, V its set of vertices and 5" is the underlying surface.\r
15

Definition 1.3.3. Let e be an edge of a map M. with endpoints ei and eg\r
(that are identified in the case of loops), and let m be a point in e which is not ei\r
nor 62- We can now divide e into two segments mi and 7712. A of a map Ai\r
is a pair consisting of a vertex and an incident segment. If there are no free edges\r
then every edge has two darts.\r
In we can see the three different kinds of edges on a map with their\r
corresponding darts.\r
Z/Oop, edpe ond yree e(f^e\r
We can associate an algebraic structure to the topological construction de\u0002scribed above. We will first consider the map M. with its set of darts that we will\r
call 0+, the superscript + means that we are working with maps on orientable\r
structures, since we are only interested in Riemann surfaces, we will not cover the\r
definition of maps for Klein surfaces, for a survey of that topic see [BS] and [IS].\r
We define two permutations of [2+ as follows:\r
- ro consists of cycles formed by going round each vertex in an anticlockwise\r
direction.\r
• ri is the product of the transpositions that interchange the two darts on an\r
edge or loop, and fix the dart on a free edge.\r
The product r2 = consist of cycles which define anticlockwise rotations\r
of the darts about each face of Ai. If we let G+ = < rg, ri > be the group generated\r
by ro and ri, G+ is a subgroup of 5"^^,the group of permutations on the elements\r
of Q+, that is transitive because the graph underlying Ai is connected. G_|_ is the\r
moMOcfromi/ of Ai, we could have called it the oriented monodromy group,\r
but as we have already stated, we will only consider maps on orientable surfaces.\r
We define the algebraic map of Ai to be:\r
(A/p A<)+ = (G+,n+,ro,ri).\r
16

Exampl e 1.3.4. The tetrahedron in Fig. 1.1.a) has 0+ = {n \\ n = 1...12} as\r
its set of darts, and the permutations are:\r
ro (1,2,3)(4,5,6)(7,8,9)(10,11,12 )\r
n (1,9)(2,11)(3,6)(4,10)(5,7)(8,12)\r
7-2 ^ (1,8,11)(2,10,6)(3,5,9)(4,12,7 )\r
Exampl e 1.3.5. The map in Fig. 1.1.b) has 0+ = {n \\ n = 1...15} as its set\r
of darts. The permutations are:\r
ro (1,2,3,4,5)(6,7,8)(9,10,11,12)(13,14,15 )\r
n (1,11)(2)(3)(4,15)(5,6)(7,14)(8,9)(10,13)(12)\r
rz ^ (1,10,15,3, 2)(4,14,6)(5,8,12,11)(7,13,9)\r
Definition 1.3.6. We define an algebraic map as a quadruple:\r
:= (G'+,^]+,ro,ri)\r
where is a Suite set, (7+ is a transitive subgroup of the group of permutations\r
generated by rg and ri, and where ri is a product of disjoint transpositions.\r
We call r2 = To any oriented algebraic map there is a topological map\r
so that AZ^+(Ai) =\r
If ro and r2 have orders m and a respectively, we say that Ai (resp. yl"'") haa\r
(m, Ti), that is, the Z.c.m. of the valencies of vertices and faces are m and M\r
respectively.\r
Given the triangle group T[m, 2,n] with a presentation of the form:\r
r[m, 2, n] =< a, b | a™' = b"^ = = 1 >\r
and a map Ai of type (m, n) with AZp"^(Ai) = r2+,ro,ri), we can de6ne an\r
epimorphism 6 : T[m, 2, n] —sendin g a to tq and 6 to ri.\r
Let G+a — {p G G+lap = a } be the stabiliser of a E then M =\r
is called a fundamental group of M in T[m, 2,n]. A different choice of dart a will\r
yield a group conjugated to M in r[m, 2, n], hence to every map Af of type (m, n),\r
we can associate a conjugacy class of fundamental groups in r[m, 2, n] (see [JSl]).\r
Next, we identify (1+ with the set of right M-cosets in r[m, 2, n] by the bijection\r
MA —a!(/i^). Taking M* = jiL'er(^), the core of M (the intersection of all the\r
conjugates of M by elements of F), we can identify G+ with the quotient group\r
17

r[m, 2, M]/M* by M*p ^ so that the action of a (respectively 6) corresponds to\r
the permutation ro (respec. ri) in (7+. In this way we see that any finite index\r
subgroup M < [m, 2,i s a fundamental group of some oriented map.\r
It is possible to generalize the concept of dart, so that we can define maps\r
on Klein surfaces, this generalization relates in a natural way to the inclusion of\r
crystallographic triangle groups into NEC triangle groups, see [BS].\r
Another important property of a fundamental group M of a map Ai is that\r
the surface 5" in which the map is embedded is uniformized (not uniquely) by M in\r
the sense that:\r
^=M\u0002To every topological map corresponds an algebraic map, and from any algebraic\r
map we can recover a topological map. Unfortunately, this relationship does not\r
make both categories equivalent, since there are many ways of altering a topological\r
map via an homeomorphism of the underlying surface without a counterpart in the\r
side of algebraic maps. We want to have a geometrical definition of map that\r
allows us to translate results from the algebraic category to the geometrical one,\r
and in order to do so, we need to define maps on surfaces in such a way that the\r
isomorphisms between them correspond to isomorphisms between their underlying\r
surfaces. These maps when considered on Riemann surfaces were originally called\r
mopg by [JS], we will call them maps, since their isomorphisms\r
correspond to mappings that preserve the analytic structure of their underlying\r
surfaces. The first step to define them is to define universal maps and quotients of\r
maps.\r
The NEC triangle group r(2, m,») acts naturally on 7^ and has a triangle T\r
of angles a = §, 6 = ^ and c = ^ as its fundamental polygon. If we draw a dart\r
on the side (z6, and let F act on ab with that dart, we get a map on 7^ with all the\r
edges of the same length and such that all vertices have order m and aU faces have\r
order m, this is the map o/ (ype\r
Let Ai = (^,V,5') be a topological map of type (m,n), then there is an\r
algebraic map ^ = yl/p(Ai) associated with it, from where we can calculate a\r
fundamental group M of M.. We have seen that M < (2,m, n) and therefore M\r
acts on the universal map Ai of type (m, n) sending vertices to vertices, edges\r
18

to edges and face centres to face centres. The quotient of this action is a map\r
vM of type (m, zi) which is naturally embedded in the surface 5" by the covering\r
TT : P and which is topologically equivalent to Ai. Ai is an map of\r
VW.\r
Any analytic map, is in particular a topological map. We have proved that to\r
any algebraic map there is at least one topological map Ai so that .A =\r
Definition 1.3.7. Two maps M and M ' of type (m, n) embedded in the sur\u0002faces 6" and 5" are called if there is an analytic isomorphism\r
between the surfaces that takes the set of vertices, edges and faces of Ai to the set\r
of vertices, edges and faces of Ai' respectively.\r
If we consider the dehnition of an algebraic map, there is no reason why we\r
should restrict ourselves to quadruples where ri has order two, and not consider\r
groups where this condition is dropped. In fact, this property corresponds to the\r
fact that the edges have only two vertices, so by allowing a higher order in ri, we will\r
study maps whose edges contain more than two vertices, and whose fundamental\r
group is a Snite index subgroup of the triangle group Those objects are\r
what we call Ayjcermopa.\r
1.4. Hypermaps\r
Definition 1.4.1. An oriented algebraic hypermap A consists of a finite set of\r
objects 0+ that we will call the bits (or brins) of A, together with two permutations\r
ro,ri G and a group G+ = < ro,ri > such that G+ is transitive in\r
(As before we will drop the word "orientable" since we will only consider Rie\u0002mann surfaces). We call G+ the protip of the hypermap Vl. The cycles\r
ro and correspond to and in precisely the same way as\r
the cycles generating the monodromy group of a map corresponds to vertices and\r
edges, while the permutation rg = (rori)"^ corresponds to The hyper\u0002map is represented by the quadruple ((9_|_,f]+,ro,ri), and if n has order we say\r
that ^ has (/o,4,^2)' The of is equal to |r2+|.\r
We extend the notion of fundamental group to hypermaps by considering the\r
natural epimorphism ^ : r[Zo, Zi, Zg] ^ G+ in the same way as we did with maps. We\r
therefore can deEne a of ./I to be M = ^"^(G+a)- We will use\r
19

the word o/^ebrozc (feagm to refer to either an oriented algebraic map or hypermap\r
indistinctly.\r
Although from the algebraic point of view there is little difference between a\r
map and a hypermap, it is not intuitively immediate how to view a map on a surface\r
when we allow each edge to meet as many vertices as necessary, several authors\r
have suggested different ways of doing it, we wiU first give an abstract definition of\r
topological hypermap on Riemann surfaces and then describe the representations\r
by CoTi, James and\r
Definition 1.4.2. A topological hypermap % on n. Riemann surface 5" is a\r
triple (5", y ) where ^ and y are closed subsets of 5" such that:\r
a j := E ' n y is a non-empty finite set. 0+ is called the set of (or\r
^ U y is connected.\r
The components of E' and y are homeomorphic to closed discs. The compo\u0002nents of E' are called while the component of y are the\r
The components of 5" — (E'uy ) are homeomorphic to open discs and are called\r
/ig/peT/aces.\r
We will call an object which is either a topological map or\r
hypermap on a Riemann or Klein surface.\r
For an explanation of dessins on Klein surfaces see [IS].\r
T h e Cori representatio n\r
In the Cori representation (see [Co]) hypervertices and hyperedges are rep\u0002resented by closed polygons called 0-faces and 1-faces respectively (we will colour\r
0-faces with a light grey and 1-faces with a dark grey), each polygon having as many\r
sides as the length of the cycle it represents, while hyperfaces are represented by\r
open polygons called 2-faces each one having twice as many sides as the order of the\r
hyperface they represent (2-faces are painted white). 0-faces are mutually disjoint,\r
as are 1-faces, and they intersect each other only in their vertices, which represent\r
the bits, each bit shared by precisely one hypervertex and one hyperedge. As the\r
hypermap is embedded in an orientable surface A, we can de&ne an anticlockwise\r
permutation of the bits around each 0-face and each 1-face consistent with the ori\u0002entation of these permutations corresponds to ro and respectively. If we call\r
y the set of aU O-faces, and ^ the set of aU 1-faces, then y U ^ is a closed set in\r
i?, and the components of R — {V U E) are the 2-faces, which are open polygons\r
20

that induce the permutation rg = (ror^^). As 2-faces have an even number of bits,\r
^2 permute the bits acting as the square of the clockwise permutation around each\r
hyperface.\r
The Cori representation is very easy to draw and shows some symmetries of\r
the hypermap in a clear way, but has the drawback of differentiating between hy\u0002pervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces in a way that seems unnatural if we regard\r
the algebraic definition of the hypermap.\r
T h e Jame s representatio n\r
The James representation (see [Ja]) displays the trinity among hypervertices,\r
hyperedges and hyperfaces in a more natural way. This time O-faces, l-faces and\r
2-faces will aU be polygons with twice as many sides as the orders of the elements\r
they represent. The intersection of any two i-faces is always empty, and O-faces\r
and l-faces intersect along one side. To place the bits, we need to consider the\r
three-valent map on ^ dehned by the sides of these polygons, in such a map every\r
vertex heis order three and each edge separates faces of diSFerent labels (there are\r
no two i-faces with a common edge). Going anticlockwise around each vertex, we\r
get a permutation of the faces that is either (0,1,2) or (0,2,1), if the permutation\r
is (0,1,2), the vertex is called a bit. Once the bits are placed, the permutations\r
ro, ri and rg follow in the same way as with the Cori representation.\r
Cori James\r
Con: Jamea Aypermap %e.\r
To go from the Cori representation to the James representation, we push to\u0002gether the hypervertices and hyperedges with a common bit, thereby changing the\r
bit in the Cori representation (one point) to an edge in the James representation\r
one of whose vertices is a bit, and doubling the number of sides of every 0-face and\r
1-face.\r
21

T h e Walsh representatio n\r
In order to introduce this representation first presented in [Wal], we need to\r
define a mop, that is, a map in which the vertices have one of two colours,\r
and such that aU edges connect vertices of different colours. Starting now at the\r
Cori representation, we substitute every 0-face by a 0-vertex (where the number\r
of the vertex refers to its colour) and every 1-face by a 1-vertex, and we join two\r
vertices together if and only if their respective 0-face and 1-face intersect in a bit,\r
therefore substituting each bit shared by the 0-face and 1-face for an edge joining\r
the two new vertices. We have now a bipartite map on the surface, with the same\r
number of edges as the number of bits of the original hypermap, the vertices in the\r
bipartite map stand for the hypervertices and hyperedges, while the faces of the\r
bipartite map represents the hyperfaces of the original hypermap. The permutation\r
ro (resp. ri) corresponds to anticlockwise rotation around each 0-vertex (resp. 1-\r
vertex) while r2 corresponds to the clockwise permutation of the edges around a\r
face.\r
Fig. 1.4. Walsh representation of Tie\r
Exampl e 1.4.3. The hypermap 'He has 0+ = {n \\ n 1...12} as its set of\r
bits, and the permutations are:\r
ro (1,2)(3,12,10,6)(4,5,7)(8,9,11)\r
ri ^ (2,3)(5,6,7)(9,10,12)(1,4,8,11)\r
r2-4(l,8,ll)(2,10,6)(3,5,9)(4,12,7)\r
We have already defined the cycles ro, ri and 7-2 = ^ for the hypermap\r
when we explained the Cori model. If we let G+ :=< ro,ri >, (?+ is a transitive\r
subgroup of 5"^^, and we define the or%en(e(f oZgebrmc of to be:\r
XZ^+(?/) = (G+,n+,ro,ri).\r
22

We say that the hypermap has (g/joe (Z,m, n) if ro, ri and r2 have orders Z, m\r
and n respectively.\r
It is clear that if any element of the set (Z, m, n} is 2, then the quadruple will\r
be an algebraic map up to duality. We will use the name cfeaam to refer\r
to either algebraic maps or algebraic hypermaps.\r
We can embed % into the surface:\r
U\r
which is a Riemann surface since M is a subgroup of a crystallographic triangle\r
group.\r
To define an analytic structure on hypermaps, we follow a similar procedure\r
to the one explained in the case of maps. We Erst define the wnzweraaJ of\r
type (/,m, n) by using a triangle with angles 7r// (labelled 0), yr/m (labelled 1) and\r
7r/n (labelled 2). By the action of r(Z,m, n) on that triangle, we get a map over\r
7^ with three diSerent types of vertices, if we delete the vertices of type 2 and the\r
edges meeting these vertices, and paint with white the vertices of type 0 and with\r
black those of type 1, we get a Walsh representation of the uniferaof Ai/permap of\r
type (/, m, yi) which we shall call 'K(/, m, n) or simply % when no confusion arises.\r
If = (6", y ) is a topological hypermap of type (Z, /M, 7%), we can calculate\r
its algebraic hypermap and its fundamental group H < r(/,m, n). Letting H act\r
on "K, we get a quotient hypermap H/H embedded into V/H^ and we call it the\r
dianalytic hypermap corresponding to ?/. If ^ contains no orientation reversing\r
elements, by using the Fuchsian triangle group r[l, m, n] for the orientable universal\r
we get an analytic hypermap corresponding to\r
Definition 1.4.4. Two hypermaps 1-1 and H' of type embedded in\r
the surfaces ^ and 5" are if there is an analytic isomorphism\r
between the surfaces that sends the set of hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces\r
of "K to their corresponding sets in\r
1.5. Group of Automorphisms of a dessin\r
Since we have dehned maps and hypermaps as particular cases of dessins, I will\r
dehne morphisms in the category of dessins, and the natural restrictions of these\r
morphisms can be translated in an easy way to either maps or hypermaps. We will\r
23

use the name vertices, edges and faces of a dessin to refer to either vertices, edges\r
and faces of a map, or hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces of a hypermap.\r
Whenever no distinction is needed, I will use "bits" to refer to darts and bits.\r
Results in this section are well known in dessin theory, and most of them have\r
been reworded from [JSl]. When they are more general than the original result,\r
the proof still follows along the same lines.\r
Definition 1.5.1. We will say that 0 is a topological morphism between the\r
dessins D and D' with topological structures given by (5", jF, y ) and\r
if : 5" —> 5" is a topological covering between the underlying surfaces (possibly\r
ramihed, all branch points having hnite order), preserving orientation and so that\r
<^(^) = and <^(y) = r .\r
We say that D D' if there is a morphism from D to D'.\r
Theorem 1.5.2. Let D and D' be dessins of type (Z, n), then %) covers D' if\r
and only if there are groups M and M ' which are representatives of the conjugacy\r
classes of fundamental groups of D and D' respectively, such that M < M'.\r
Definition 1.5.3. Given two dessins V and V embedded respectively in S\r
and we will say that : D —> is an morpAzam between the dessins if\r
is a topological morphism between the dessins and an analytic morphism between\r
the underlying surfaces.\r
This definition of morphism between dessins is more restrictive than the one\r
originally suggested in [JSl], since we impose the condition that the morphism\r
preserves the analytic structure of the surface. It corresponds to the "Riemann\r
morphism" between maps described in that paper.\r
Definition 1.5.4. We will say that the pair of functions i/j = (f,g ) is an\r
a/pebrozc mofpAwm between the dessins D and D' with algebraic structures given\r
by (G, Q, ro, ri) and by ( C, rg, r^) respectively, if / : > r]' is an onto function\r
and p : G ^ is a group epimorphism such that p(ro) = fg, p(ri) = and the\r
following diagram commutes:\r
X G ^ 0\r
/ 9 f\r
ri' X G' ^ f]'\r
that is, f{ar) = f{a)g{r), for any r G G acting on any a G O.\r
24

We will say that xp = {f,g) as in Definition 1.5.4. is an algebraic isomorphism\r
between the dessina %) and D' with algebraic structure as above if / : fZ —> is a\r
bijective map and p : G — C is a group isomorphism.\r
Two topological dessins D and are if there exists a topological\r
morphism ^ between them, such that is a homeomorphism between the underlying\r
surfaces, therefore the group of topological automorphisms of a dessin is too ample\r
for our purposes, on the other hand, the group of analytic automorphisms of a dessin\r
is hnite, and in fact is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the underlying\r
surface. The analytic definition of isomorphism introduces some rigidity in the\r
structure of topological dessin that is needed if we want to define a one to one\r
correspondence between algebraic and geometric structures.\r
Definition 1.5.5. Two dessins D and %)' are or just\r
if there is an analytic isomorphism between them.\r
Propositio n 1.5.6. Any dessin V which is equivalent to an analytic dessin\r
D' is an analytic dessin itself.\r
Corollary 1.5.7. The following results are equivalent for dessins embedded\r
in Riemann surfaces:\r
- The analytic dessins %) and D' are isomorphic.\r
- The algebraic dessins AZp(D) and are isomorphic.\r
- The oriented algebraic dessins and are isomorphic.\r
We can now define the class V of all the analytic dessins isomorphic to V and\r
the class A of all the algebraic dessins isomorphic to A.\r
Theorem 1.5.8. For any class A there is only one class V such that, given\r
V e V, Alg{T>) G A. And for any class V there is only one class A so that the\r
analytic dessins associated with the algebraic dessins in .A are all contained in D.\r
Corollary 1.5.9. Analytic dessins with morphisms and algebraic dessins with\r
morphisms are two equivalent categories.\r
Therefore, we can define the functors and that induce mutually inverse\r
bijections between the isomorphism classes of oriented algebraic and analytic dessins\r
of finite type.\r
Theorem 1.5.10. Let Dy and D2 be subgroups of r[/o, /i, h] of finite index so\r
that they are fundamental groups of some dessins, then, they give rise to isomorphic\r
analytic dessins if and only if they are conjugate in r[/o, h]-\r
25

Theorem 1.5.11. If D has fundamental group D < T(lo,h,l2), then the full\r
group of automorphisms of V is:\r
where is the normahzer of D in r(foXi,^2)- Now we can assume that\r
the dessin can be embedded in a Riemaim surface, in which case, the group of\r
orientation preserving automorphisms of D is:\r
We will say that a dessin is if its group of automorphisms acts transi\u0002tively on the set of bits. Regular dessins corresponds to dessins with the greatest\r
degree of symmetry. If we relax the transitivity condition, and request only that\r
all the vertices have the same valency, all the edges have the same valency, and all\r
the faces have the same valency, we get unz/orm dessins. Every regular dessin is\r
uniform, but the converse is false.\r

Chapte r Two\r
PSL(2,p) and Hecke groups\r
This chapter is divided into two main parts. The Arst one (2.A.) studies the\r
structure of the family of Snite groups jP^Z,(2,p) where p E Z is prime, focusing\r
in particular in the cases where p E {5,7,11}. These cases are covered in three\r
separate sections.\r
In the second part (2.B.) we will introduce jif" (for n > 3), the family of Hecke\r
groups of the hrst kind. Two separate sections have been used to describe the main\r
properties of which is the modular group, and\r
While the Hecke groups and are important for our work because they\r
provide us with a tool for the arithmetic characterization of the two main combi\u0002natorial structures embeddings described in chapter four, (Singerman's embedding\r
of the Fano plane, and the 3-biplane embedding into we are also interested\r
in PSL{2,7) and PSL{2,11), because they are isomorphic to the automorphism\r
groups of the Fano plane and the 3-biplane respectively.\r
27

2.A. The structure of f\r
Let us call 5'2(2,p) := where p is a prime and p > 2, i.e. the set of all\r
2 x 2 matrices with coefBcients in the held Zp such that the determinant is equal to\r
1. f5'i^(2,p) is SZ,(2,p) modulo its center, that is, modulo (7, - 7 ) where 7 is the\r
identity matrix.\r
Propositio n 2.A.I. PSL{2,p) where p > 3 prime, is a non-commutative\r
finite group of order\r
p(p - l)(p + 1)\r
2\r
Proo f That PSL{2,p) where p > 3 prime is non-commutative is easily seen\r
by considering for example matrices\r
"= ( o 1 ) J\r
in f 5'Z,(2,p) and checking that ^ 6a.\r
To calculate its order we will count all matrices\r
- a;?/ ^ 0: There are f — 1 choices for a; and p — 1 choices for ?/, we can then\r
choose ( in p ways and for each choice of a;, i/, ( there is only one possible choice\r
for z. That yields — 1)^ elements of this form.\r
- a;?/ — 0: If we aasume a; = 0 then there are p choices for ( and p — 1 choices\r
for y. Once x, y, t are fixed there is only one possible value for z. If y = 0 the\r
same reasoning applies and so there are 2p{p — 1) matrices of this form.\r
We have proved that \\SL{2,p)\\ = p{p — l)(p + 1) and the order of PSL{2,p)\r
follows naturally from the fact that \\PSL(2,p}\\ = [SL(2,p) : (±/)]. •\r
It is well known that every group PSL{2,p) acts transitively on a set of p + 1\r
elements, and we will prove it geometrically in the following lines. In order to\r
see this action geometrically, we call Pp the projective line defined over the field\r
Zp. Every element in Pp = {0,l,..., p — l,oo} can be represented by a pair of\r
homogeneous coordinates [r : s] (where r, 5 E Zp), so that [r : g] stands for:\r
oo if s = 0\r
where ^ = rs\r
(mod p) if 5 ^ 0\r
28

As we have already mentioned in chapter 1, we will be using the standard\r
abuse of notation whereby elements of f 5'Z,(2,p) are thought of as matrices, and\r
we will associate to every element M G f a bijection of Pp dehned in the\r
usual way:\r
where as usual /M(oo) = if c ^ 0 (mod p) and /M(oo) = co if c = 0 (mod p).\r
It is easy to see that the image of z by /M does not depend on the choice of\r
homogeneous coordinates for z. As /M is a bijection in the finite set Pp, we can\r
treat it as a hnite permutation and End its representation as a product of disjoint\r
cycles. That this action is transitive is easy to see since\r
a= Q J ) . i= J ) eP5'L(2,p)\r
and the action of o on the points of Pp is a cyclic permutation of the finite points\r
(i.e. those which admit coordinates [r : 1], r E Zp) while the action of 6 swaps oo\r
and 0.\r
Propositio n 2.A.2. PSL(2,p) acts doubly transitively on Pp.\r
Proo f If we consider the ordered pair (a, b) E Pp with a ^ b (mod p) and\r
oo 0 {o, 6}, we see that the matrix\r
e-PSi(2.p )\r
takes the ordered pair (0, oo) to (a, 6). If oo E {a, 6}, we need to consider two cases\r
separately:\r
- If 6 = oo we take = 1 and = 0, and then sends (0, oo) to (o, 6).\r
If o = oo then we can take\r
and the action is doubly transitive.\r
However, the action of f 5'Z,(2,p) on Pp is not triply transitive in general, as\r
we can see with {0,1, oo} and (0,1,3} for p — 7.\r
29

Propositio n 2.A.3. Given p,q e Z prime numbers so that p = I (mod q),\r
there is only one non commutative group G of order |G| = pq that we shall call\r
Gpg. The structure of Gp, is given by\r
Cp X Cg = < /, e I /P = = 1 >\r
where w G Z* and — g. Therefore the structure of the semidirect product\r
is independent of the choice of it.\r
Proof As p is prime there is a subgroup Cp of order p in G, and by Sylow's\r
theorem the number TV of these subgroups satisfy\r
TV = 1 (mod p) and N | q.\r
Therefore TV = 1 and using Sylow's theorem again Cp < G and the structure of G is\r
given by:\r
< /, 6 I = 1 >\r
where it G Zp.\r
- Assume that or(Z2.(w) ^ g, then either it = 1 or ^ 1 (mod p). If it = 1\r
it is easy to see that G is commutative and therefore of no interest to us. On the\r
other hand, if i/^ ^ 1 (modp), using = 1 we get and by\r
making s — g we get / = By elementary group theory (u^ — 1) = 0 (mod p),\r
which is a contradiction.\r
• Once we have proved that ordz* (u) = q, all that remains is to prove that for\r
different it, the corresponding groups are isomorphic. To do so we choose a new\r
generator (where s ^ 0 (mod g)) so that we can rewrite the last identity\r
in the presentation of G as = 1. As g is prime ordz.(it^) = g and it^\r
runs through all order g elements in Z* therefore making it possible to derive any\r
other presentation from the one in proposition 2.A.3.\r
Not e If g is not prime, the result is not true, as we can see with the following\r
non-commutative and non isomorphic groups of order 20:\r
G = < A, / I = / ^ = V = 1 >\r
G' = < A, / I = /^ = = 1 >\r
In general, given p = 1 (mod , the number of non-isomorphic groups of the\r
form Cp X Cn is d{n), that is, the number of divisors of n.\r
30

Corollary 2.A,4. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and q another prime so that\r
p = 1 (mod g). There are only two groups of order pg:\r
- The cyclic group that we shall call Cpg.\r
- The semidirect product Cp x Cg = Gpg and is presented as in the previous\r
proposition. This group haa one normal subgroup of order p that we shall call\r
= < / >, and p subgroups of order g, that are conjugate by the action of the\r
elements of Cp.\r
Proof Let us call ^ any group so that |jif| — pg where p and g are as in\r
the hypothesis. If ^ is non commutative, we are in the hypothesis of the previous\r
proposition and we have finished. That Cp < H is unique and normal is true by\r
Sylow's theorem. If the order g subgroups were not conjugate by / , then one of\r
them should be normal in Tif (since for a certain s will belong to its normalizer)\r
which contradicts Sylow's theorem.\r
If ^ is commutative it must be the direct product of a Q, and a Cg, and\r
therefore, we have\r
Propositio n 2.A.5. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and n = 2 ^ . If we consider\r
the action of f 5'i^(2,p) on where a; G Pp. We get that = Cp x with\r
presentation:\r
where G Z* and (w) = M.\r
Proof Since the action of f 6'i^(2,p) on Pp is transitive, we can choose a; = oo\r
without loss of generality, and we see that\r
|^W(oo)| =\r
In fact, 5'(o6(oo) consists of any element of the form ^ ^ % j where a, 6 G Zp\r
and o ^ 0. If we call\r
1 / o 1\r
0 1 / \\ 0 ^\r
O\r
where ordz.(a) = 2^ — p — 1, we have that ord(/) = p and or(f(e) = n =\r
therefore e and / generate 5'(a6(oo). We can see that and then the\r
result is proved.\r
31

Lemm a 2.A.6. Let p be a prime p > 3, m G Z a positive integer so that p = I\r
(mod m). The following two subgroups of GL{2,p) have order pm:\r
| o , beZp , a"^ = l(modp) j\r
I o, 6 G Zp, (1^ = 1 (mod p)^\r
- j ( 0 1\r
hag presentation\r
< /i, / I /i": = /P = = 1 >\r
while a presentation for "Mpm is given by\r
< /i, / I = yp = = 1 >\r
where a G Z* and ordz* (s) = m and (r, m) = 1.\r
If m is odd we have that\r
If m is even the two groups are non isomorphic.\r
Proof An easy process of counting elements shows that the order of both\r
groups is pm, and using Sylow's theorems we get that the group structure is Cp xCm,\r
furthermore the groups are non commutative.\r
Once we have identif ed the structure of both groups, all we need to do is choose\r
suitable generators / and of order p and m respectively and study the action of\r
h on f . A choice for Qpm is / = j ^ , A = ^ ^ i ^ where ordz* (a) = m. It is\r
immediate to check that hfh'~^f~"' = 1 and the other possibilities arise when one\r
substitute h with where (s, m) = 1.\r
0 \\\r
A choice of generators for is / as before and ^ ^ I, bearing this\r
in mind, the rest of the proof is as above.\r
If m is odd we can dehne the isomorphism ^ by\r
a 6 \\ 6a\r
O\r
0 u " I 0 1\r
By working with the presentationa, it is easy to see that no isomorphism be\u0002tween the groups can be defined in the case where m is even.\r
32

Propositio n 2.A.7. Let p, g G Z be primes, p > 5 and q > 2 so that p = 1\r
(mod g), and let Gpg be as in Corollary 2.A.4. There are only two groups ^ up to\r
isomorphism so that < ^7 and [jif : Gpg] = 2. The two possibilities for ^ Eire\r
either :\r
H = Q2pq — Gpq X C2 or H = ?^2pg\u0002Proof As [jif : Gpg] = 2, we have that Gpg < so in order to describe ^ we\r
need to Snd all possible order two automorphisms (% : Gpg —Gpg . Taking Gpg\r
presented as in Proposition 2.A.3., and using the information from Corollary 2.A.4.\r
we get that o" must satisfy:\r
o'(e) =\r
where a, s 6 Zp and 6 E Zg.\r
- As = / we have that o = ± 1 (mod p).\r
- As (7 has to preserve the relations of Gpg, from\r
1 = (7(e/e-Y"" ) we get eVe"' ' =\r
but in particular we know that and since a ^ 0 (mod p), we have\r
= 1 (mod p) and so 6 = 1 (mod g).\r
If o = 1 (mod p), from cr^(e) = e we obtain a = 0 since otherwise Gpg should\r
be commutative.\r
We have proved that either cr is equal to the identity ci : Gpg —Gp g or is a\r
representative of the following family of order two automorphisms:\r
c-l\r
0-2 (/) = / 0-2 (e) = /''e/-\r
where g E Zp.\r
Since there is at least one element of order two in — Gpg, we can call it g and\r
assume that it induces the automorphism of Gpg, i.e. <7i(a;) — for % E {1,2}\r
and z E Gpg.\r
In the case of cri it is easy to see that p commutes with the generators of Gpg\r
and therefore we obtain jif ^ Gpg x C2 and from there\r
H = G2pq\u000233

For the action of erg, we need to prove that the same group H is generated\r
regardless of the choice of a G Zp. We can see that the equations relating the three\r
generators of ^ are:\r
1) e/e'V " == 1 2) = 1 3) = 1.\r
We can choose to change the generator e for E' — where n E Zp. If we\r
do so we get the following expressions\r
1) E/E- = 1 2) p/p / = 1 3) = 1.\r
As K ^ 1 and Zp is a field, if we let n = ^ we can easily show that any choice\r
of g yields the same group structure as s = 0. O\r
Given a group G, we will say that the subgroups F, Tif < G are\r
if given any element p E (3 we can express it in a unique way as a product p = //t\r
where / E f and A E If that is the case, we will write G = F .ff. It should be\r
noticed that two subgroups F, ^ < G are complementary if and only if G = F jf\r
and n = {!}.\r
A very interesting point about f5'Z,(2,p) goes back to Galois, who proved the\r
following result:\r
Theorem 2.A.8. For p > 11, there is no subgroup of PSL{2,p) which is\r
complementary to any of its p-subgroups.\r
That means that for p > 11 we cannot get jP5'Z^(2,p) = Zp, which im\u0002plies that there is no transitive action on p points for PSL{2,p) if p > 11. This\r
can be seen in the following way: as p is a factor of \\PSL(2,p)\\ and p^ is not\r
(see Proposition 2.A.I.), if there is a transitive action of PSL{2,p) on p points\r
{a;i,... ,a;p}, no order p element of f5'i^(2,p) can fix any {a;^} (otherwise p^ will\r
divide |f5'i^(2,p)|), which means that given g E f5'Z,(2,p) of order p, we have that\r
f ^Z,(2,p) = 5'(a6(a;i) < p > for any z E {1,... ,p}.\r
For the cases where p < 11 and f 5'i,(2,p) simple, that is, for p = 5, 7,11, we\r
know that the following holds:\r
f;9i:(2,5) = A4-C5 f^i,(2,7 ) = &.C 7 fgI,(2,ll) = A5.Ci i\r
and therefore PSL{2,p) acts transitively on p points. Through this work we will\r
try to explore this special feature geometrically, especially for the cases where p = 7\r
and p = 11.\r
34

2.1. The structure of f 5'j}(2,5)\r
We will not go into too much length for the case p = 5, but for the sake\r
of completeness, we will explain two ways of seeing its geometrical action on five\r
points, f 5'Z,(2,5) is isomorphic to A5, the alternating group on Ave elements that\r
is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of an icosahedron.\r
Lemm a 2.1.1. Ag is a simple group and it contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 12.\r
- 6 conjugate subgroups of order 5.\r
- 10 conjugate subgroups of order 3.\r
- 5 conjugate subgroups of order 12, each one isomorphic to A4.\r
This is not a full description of ail the subgroups of Ag and it merely describes\r
those subgroups order that are interesting for our work. For each conjugacy class,\r
we can End Eve diSierent embeddings of A4 into Ag, and its algebraic action on\r
Sve points is readily seen as its action on these embeddings by conjugation. Our\r
geometrical examples will mirror this action.\r
- Given an icosahedron, we can see its face centres as the vertices of hve tetra\u0002hedra inscribed in it. The symmetry group of the icosahedron permutes the\r
inscribed tetrahedra transitively.\r
• For another view of the same phenomenon, we can consider the set of edges\r
of the icosahedron and form pairs of antipodal edges. Thus we obtain fifteen\r
pairs of edges so that each pair defines a rectangle inscribed in the icosahedron.\r
The fifteen rectangles form triples of mutually orthogonal elements, and the\r
action of PSL(2,5) will permute transitively the five triples.\r
It is eaay to see how these two examples relate to the algebraic action explained\r
above, since the symmetry group of both the tetrahedron and a triple of mutually\r
orthogonal rectangles is isomorphic to A4.\r
35

2.2. The structure of PSL{2,7)\r
We will represent f 7) as the group generated by the following matrices\r
"=(- 1 I)' ''=( ? ? ) • '=( 0 1\r
where = abc = 7. This group has order 168 and appears as the group\r
of automorphisms of two important classical geometric objects: the Fano plane,\r
which will be covered together with other examples of finite geometries in the next\r
chapter, and Klein's quartic, that will be described in chapter four.\r
Lemma 2.2.1. [Kll] PSL{2,7) is a simple group of order 168 that contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 24.\r
' (2) ^ subgroups of order 3 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 21 subgroups isomorphic to C4 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 8 subgroups of order 7 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 8 subgroups of order 21 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 7 X 2 = 14 subgroups with 24 elements in two conjugacy classes. All of them\r
are isomorphic to 5'4.\r
Lemma 2.2.2. If we consider the action of PSL{2, 7) on P7 we see that:\r
1- There is a one-one correspondence between the C3 subgroups of f5'Z,(2,7)\r
and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P? given by the fixed point set of the action of\r
each C3 subgroup on IP7.\r
If a C3 subgroup corresponds to {a, b}, we will refer to it as\r
2- There is a one-one correspondence between the C? subgroups of f5'iL(2,7)\r
and the points of Py given by the Sxed point of the action of each Cy subgroup on\r
P 7 .\r
If a C7 subgroup corresponds to o E P7, we wiU refer to it as C7\r
3- Each subgroup of order 21 is isomorphic to C7 x C3. There is a one-one\r
correspondence between the subgroups of order 21 and the stabilisers of elements\r
in P7.\r
If a group of order 21 is the stabiliser of o E P7 we will refer to it as G21.\r
36

Proo f\r
1- We can take any order three element and calculate its cycle structure on P?,\r
for example:\r
0 —1\r
1 1\r
G f 5'iy(2,7) produces (0 6 oo) (1 3 5) (2) (4)\r
and we see that it fixes {2} and {4}. Given that all order three elements are\r
conjugate, they all have the same cycle structure and therefore every C3 fixes two\r
points in Py. Since f 5'Z,(2,7) acts transitively on pairs of points of Fy, the proof is\r
finished.\r
2- For the case of Cy we can do the same, if we start with z —> z + 1, it only\r
fixes 00. Since the group action is transitive on Py, the rest follows.\r
3- From Proposition 2.A.5. we know that for any a G P?\r
Stabi^a) = Cj X C3.\r
Since there are only eight subgroups of order 21, each one is the stabiliser of a\r
point. O\r

We will consider the geometric actions of PSL{2, 7) on seven points in chapter\r
four. Before we do that, we need to highlight the fact that the symmetric group on\r
four elements contains four subgroups of order three. We have already seen that\r
we can characterize all C3 in f 7) by their pair of Exed points (i.e. refer to\r
as (a, 6}), and we will label all subgroups of order 24 in f 5'Z,(2, 7) using this\r
characterization, that is, we will refer to each of them by the four pairs of points\r
that characterize its order three subgroups. That information is displayed in the\r
previous table and will be used in the next two chapters, the 14 embeddings of ^'4\r
have been separated into two conjugacy classes that we shall call class f and claas\r
i,. (see Example 2.3.3. in the following section).\r
2.3. The structure of P5X(2,11)\r
We can represent the group jP5'i,(2,11) in many different ways that are related\r
to triangle Fuchsian groups. We can see it as the group generated by the matrices\r
(or any other conjugation of this triple):\r
"=( ? V ) ' ''=(- 1 s ) ' '=(0 1\r
where — abc = I. This representation is useful when we study\r
epimorphisms from Fuchsian groups with three periods of type [2,5,11]. On the\r
other hand we can see it as the group generated by the matrices:\r
"=( 1 ~o')' ''=( 1 / ) • °=( o ?\r
where a? = = abc = I, and we will use these matrices for groups of type\r
[2,3,11]. There are other ways of presenting this group that we will cover in chapter\r
four.\r
f 5'i^(2,11) has order 660 and beside being the biggest group of the family of\r
f 6'Z^(2,p) that acts transitively on p points, it is the automorphism group of the\r
3-biplane, as we shall prove in chapter three.\r
Lemm a 2.3.1. [Di] PSL{2,11) is a simple group of order 660 and contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 60.\r
- ( ^ ) = 66 subgroups of order 6ve in one conjugacy class.\r
- 12 subgroups of order eleven in one conjugacy class.\r
38

- 12 subgroups of order 55 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 2 X 11 = 22 subgroups of order 60 in two conjugacy classes. All of them are\r
isomorphic to Ag.\r
This list is not complete, there are some other subgroups of 11) that\r
are not mentioned here, however, it is complete for every order that is mentioned\r
in the lemma.\r
Lemma 2.3.2. If we consider the action of PSL(2,11) on P n we see that:\r
- There is a one-one correspondence between the C5 subgroups of f5'Z,(2,ll)\r
and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P n given by the Axed point set of the\r
action of each C5 subgroup on P n .\r
If a C5 subgroup corresponds to {o, 6}, we will refer to it as\r
- There is a one-one correspondence between the Cn subgroups of f6'Z,(2,11)\r
and the points of P n given by the hxed point of the action of each Cn subgroup\r
on Pii.\r
If a Cii subgroup corresponds to a E P n , we will refer to it aa\r
- Each subgroup of order 55 is isomorphic to Cn x C5. There is a one-one cor\u0002respondence between the subgroups of order 55 and the stabilisers of elements\r
in P7.\r
If a group of order 55 is the stabiliser of a E P? we will refer to it as Ggg.\r
The proof for the above lemma is similar to the proof for the corresponding\r
one in the case p — 7 (Lemma 2.2.2.) so we will omit it here.\r
The geometric actions of PSL{2,11) on eleven points will be covered in chapter\r
4, and as we have done before we need to explain a way of classifying the embeddings .\r
of Ag into f 5'iL(2,11). We have seen that there are six possible embeddings of C5\r
into v45, and that each C5 < f5'Z,(2,ll) can be labelled with its pair of hxed\r
points on Pii. Following the same idea as in f 6'i^(2,7), we wiU characterize every\r
^5 < f 5'i^(2,11) by a sextuple of pairs of points as it is shown in the table below.\r

Exampl e 2.3.3. Let us consider the subgroup G of PSL{2,11) generated by\r
the matrices:\r
9 0 \\ , / 9 10\r
6 5 ' = 0\r
a\r
If we consider the action of a on Pii we see that it corresponds to the permutation\r
(1,00,7,10,9) (2,3,5,6,4) (0) (8)\r
on the other hand, 6 corresponds to\r
(1,6,4,7,8) (2,10,9,5,0) (3) (oo).\r
We can label < a > = — {0,8} and < 6 > = = {3,cx3} and see that\r
G = Ag. Studying the action of on the set of pairs of points of P n , we see that\r
the pairs hxed by a and 6 belong to the same orbit, which is the sextuple of pairs\r
that characterizes G:\r
I {1,2} {5,7} {8,0} {6,10} {4,9} {3,oo} }.\r
And therefore those are the six subgroups isomorphic to C5 contained in G.\r

2.B. The Hecke group\r
In general, a Hecke group is a discrete subgroup of f5'Z,(2,R) that is\r
generated by the following two transformations:\r
% : z —> — and Z : z —> z + A\r
z\r
In a result due to Hecke [He], any group generated by % and Z as before is\r
discrete if and only if A > 2 or A = = 2 cos where M E N and M > 3. The\r
Hecke groups where A > 2, are Fuchsian groups of the second kind, with a limit set\r
that is nowhere dense in R, and they are of no interest to us. The case A = 2 gives\r
a Puchsian group of the hrst kind but with a non compact quotient, as for the case\r
A = An they are Fuchsian groups of the 6rst kind, and we will refer to them as\r
Every time we mention "Hecke group" in this work, we shall mean Hecke group of\r
the Erst kind. In particular, we see that\r
and for a > 4 the inclusion is strict.\r
In this work we will deal with which is the modular group F = f Z),\r
and the group where Ag is the golden ratio.\r
i + Vs\r
When considered in terms of their presentation, the groups iiZ"" are triangle\r
groups with signature [2, n, oo], where X is a representative for the elliptic elements\r
of order 2, Z is a parabohc element and\r
y = : z -\r
Z — Ar\r
is a representative for the elliptic elements of order M, thus there is one conjugate\r
class of subgroups of order n.\r
We can find a fundamental domain for which will be a hyperbolic triangle\r
in ZY with one or two of its vertices in = R = R U {oo}. A standard choice for\r
a fundamental region of is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices 0, and oo;\r
another choice is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices —an d oo.\r
41

In general, the description of the elements of -ff" cannot be explicitly done,\r
however it is possible to describe them for the cases M = 3, 4 and 6. We will cover\r
M = 3 in a later section while the other two cases are very similar to one another:\r
n = 4 we have A4 — \\/2\r
n = 6 we have Ag = \\/3.\r
We will now prove that a matrix M is an element of Tif"* where = 2(A; + 1)\r
and 77%^; = (A; + 1), (A; = 1,2) if M can be written in one of the following ways:\r
M,O \\ c y\r
where de((M) = 1 and o, 6, c, cf € Z.\r
It is easy to see that any matrix in jf"' ' must have this form. Any matrix in\r
is represented by a word in % and Z, and any word in % and Z with only one\r
% would be of the form\r
K „ = Z-ATZ' = 1\r
for a certain r, g E Z. We will prove that all words with an odd number of X in\r
them have the form of the matrix Mo while the words with an even number of %\r
have the form of Mg. We will proceed by induction and first assume that the result\r
is true for any word W) with Z or less % in it.\r
Take a word PK/+1 with Z + 1 appearances of %, we can express it as =\r
g-^Wi for certain r, s G Z and for a certain word Wi with I appearances of X.\r
By hypothesis, if Z is odd then\r
where a, 6, c, E Z and an easy calculation shows that corresponds to a\r
matrix of the form Mg. If / is even we choose W) from the set of matrices of Mg\r
and proceed in the same way.\r
As for the set of cusps, it is not known what the cusp set is for a general\r
although we know that the cusp set of f 5'_L(2, Z[An]) is Q(An) U {00} (which we\r
represent by Q(An)) and thus that of jif" must be a subset of Q(An). One of the\r
42

best results for this problem is due to Leutbecher [Leu2] who proved that for the\r
values M 6 {3,4,5,6,8,10,12} the cusp set of is:\r
U {oo}.\r
Therefore in the case n = 3, the cusp set is Q while for the case n = 5 its\r
cusp set is Q(\\/5), and in both ceises the cusp set is the whole held completed\r
with infinity. It turns out that these are the only two cases where the equahty\r
— Q(An) holds, since Wolfart [Wol] proved that it is false for any other\r
case except perhaps M = 9 and Seybold proved later that n = 9 is not possible either\r
[Ro].\r
The field Q(An) is a number held, that is, it is a hnite extension of Q, and\r
its degree is where is the Euler function. In fact it is the maximum real\r
subheld of the number held Q(e2n), where is the nth root of unity, and we can\r
easily calculate its degree since : Q(An)] = 2. The ring of algebraic integers\r
of the held Q(An) is Z[An] (see [Was]), that means that if a; 6 Q(An) is a solution\r
for\r
+ dra-l'-jC^ ^ + • • • + do = 0\r
where a, E Z, then z 6 Z[An]. And furthermore, given ?/ E Z[An] and d =\r
then ^ have the form\r
d— 1 I L \\ d—2\r
y — bd-l^n + bd-2^n + • • • + b,\r
where 6; G Z.\r
If we are to study the structure of the ideals of Z[An], it suffices to study\r
its prime ideals, since Z[Xn] is the integral ring of a number field, it is a Unique\r
Factorization Domain (UFD). We cam go even further, since for < 68 every Z[An]\r
is a PID (see [Was]) and every ideal in it is principal. Since we wiH only deal with\r
M = 3 and n = 5 that result covers our two chosen cases.\r
Given f a prime ideal of Z[An] (where n < 68) we will say that jVorm(f) = m\r
if m G Z is the smallest positive rational integer so that P | m. There is a general\r
definition of the of an ideal where the class number is diferent from 1, but\r
we will not need it here.\r
Our last concern is going to be the group of units of the rings Z[An], but in this\r
case we will only cover the cases we are going to use. For n = 3,5 the integers rings\r
43

are Z and Z\r
l-}-\\/5\r
2\r
respectively, while the group of units in the rings is {1, —1}\r
for the case n = 3, and is the cyclic group generated by for the case n = 5.\r
A standard feature of any Hecke group is that its cusp set can be represented\r
by finite continued fractions.\r
Notation We will use the notation to indicate a term inside a contin\u0002ued fractions expansion, and we will display the terms in a continued fractions\r
expansion ordered, between brackets and separated by commas to make clear the\r
non-commutative nature of this representation, so that\r
Go\r

Theorem 2.B.I. Given H'^ a Hecke group, C is a cusp of i?" if and only if it\r
can be expressed as a Enite continued fraction of of the form:\r

where 0^6%.\r
Proo f i?" is generated by X and Z, so any element in H"- is a finite word in\r
these two letters. As any parabolic element of is conjugate to a power of\r
(that fixes 0), any cusp of jif" is the image of 0 by an element of Tif". Let us assume\r
that the cusp C is the image of 0 by the word defined by\r
PF =\r

It is easy to see that\r

so that when we consider the representation of we get\r
— 1 - 1 - 1\r
aiAn_\r
' _0'2^n_ ? 1 _ ^ni^n 4" _\r
and we see that VF(0) is as in the hypothesis. To prove the converse it is enough\r
to reverse the argument so that the proof is Enished. O\r
Since Jif" is a free product of its generators, we can impose conditions on\r
E to make its expression in terms of % and Z unique, and therefore we can\r
as well consider the continued fraction representation for every cusp unique [Ro].\r
Exampl e 2.B.2. We will show how the previous theorem works. Let\r
89 + 107\\/5\r
38\r
be a cusp of 77^, an easy calculation shows that it can be expressed as\r
-1 -1\r
' _3Aj\r
and it is therefore the image of\r
Another interesting area for the study of Hecke groups are their subgroups, in\r
particular the special congruence subgroups. Given the group P5L(2,Z[A„]) and I\r
an ideal in Z[An], we can define the apeciaf con^n/ence of\r
for I as:\r
f Z[A»]) (7) = j ^ g ^ ^ ^ f ^i:(2, Z[A»]) | o = (f=l , 6 = c = 0 (mod 7)\r
f^i:(2,Z[A»])i(/) = ef^i,(2,Z[A»]) | a = (f = l, c = 0 (mod 7)\r
f^7:(2,Z[An])o(7) = j ( c ^ f^7:(2,Z[A»]) | c = 0 (mod 7)\r
45

We call PS'L(2, Z[A„])(/) the principal congruence subgroup of P5L(2,Z[A„])\r
for / . We can extend these deGnitions to Tif" and deEne the special congruence\r
subgroups of 77" as:\r
where the subscript * can be 0, 1 or omitted.\r
We will proceed to describe some relations satished by the special congruence\r
subgroups of f6'i}(2,Z[An]). That the principal congruence subgroup satisfy\r
f Z[A»])(7) < f ^i,(2, Z[A^])i(7)\r
is easy to see if we take the group epimorphism\r
T/,:P5'I,(2,Z[A^])i(7)—dehnedb y\r
where [6] denotes the class of 6 inside and calculate\r
The previous result is actually a particular caae of a more general one since\r
f6'i}(2,Z[An])(Z) is actually normal inside the group f5'i,(2,Z[An]) for which we\r
need to consider\r
« : P S L (2, given by 4- ( ^ ^ ^ )\r
where [x] is the class of a; in , it is clear that PSL{2,'L[\\n]){I) = Ker{^). We\r
have as well that\r
f Z[A»])i(7) < f Z[A»])o(Z).\r
This we can see if we consider the epimorphism\r
%:fg^(2,Z[A^])o(7)—^\r
where [a] is the class of a in and [/(Z[An]//) is the set of units of\r
Z[An]/7. We can check that jirer(%) = f5'i,(2,Z[An])i(/). It follows in a natural\r
way that the same happens to the special congruence subgroups of\r
(7) < (7) 0 (7) < 77" and 7f" (7) < 77"\r
46

Exampl e 2.B.3. The above inclusions are not necessarily strict, if we take\r
and the ideal in generated by (2), we can see that\r
As for the indices of the special congruence subgroups of for a given n, in\r
general they are not known. The indices of the subgroups of f5'Z,(2,Z[An]) (see\r
[Hur]) provide an upper bound, but there are examples where these bounds are\r
not attained.\r
1\r
[f 5'i:(2, Z[A,]) : f gz:(2, Z[A,])om] = j\r
[P^Z,(2,Z[A^]) : f^i:(2,Z[A^])(7)] = 1\r

where stands for the norm of the ideal 7, and f runs through the distinct\r
prime divisors of 7.\r
There are many cases where the indices of the special congruence subgroups\r
of 77", attain the upper bound provided by the indices of the special congruence\r
subgroups of f 5'7,(2, Z[An]), as it is shown in the following theorem by Prye [Pr]\r
Theorem 2.B.4. Let\r
i=l\r
be the prime factorization of an ideal 7 of Z[An] with (6n, 7) = 1. If n = 3 (that is,\r
for the modular group) let also be (5,7) = 1. Let 7* = 7nQ(A^) and let Arorm(7)\r
be the Aonn of 7 in Q(A^). Then\r
iH" : = 2-Norm(I'rU\r
with\r
^ 0 if there is % ^ such that 7^ D Q(An) = 7^ D Q(An)\r
0 if there is % such that = f (3i^(2,\r
- 1 otherwise\r
and P running through the prime divisors of 7*.\r

2.4. The modular group H\r
For the case where ri = 3, A3 = 1 and we get the most studied of all Hecke\r
groups, namely the modular group F\r
F = f^Z,(2,Z) =\r
a 6\r
c (f\r
E I a,6,c,dG Z\r
With presentation F = < %, Ys | = 1 > and signature [2,3, 00].\r

see Fzp. ,9.^. below.\r

transitive.\r

Proo f That 00 is a cusp of F is straightforward since ( ^ j ) G F, is parabolic\r
and hxes 00. •\r

The indices of the special congruence subgroups of can be easily calculated\r
as a particular case of the formulae provided at the end of section 2.B. (for a direct\r
proof see [Schoe]);\r
/vr2 / 1\r
[r:ri(7V)] = — —\r
[r:r(Ar)] = 7V [r:ri(7V)]\r
for any > 2 and the product running along the positive prime divisors of\r
We will take for gi anted the first equality, which is widely known, and use it to\r
prove the other two. In order to do so we will use the functions ^ and % defined in\r
section 2.B. in the context of the special congruence subgroups of f5'i,(2,Z[An]).\r
When n, = 3, r = f 5'iL(2, so we can use % to prove that\r
and therefore [r„ (N) ; r , (iV)) = ^\r
where y; is the Euler function. On the other hand, if we use we can prove that\r
r m\r
and therefore : r(jV)] = AT.\r
For any integer A^ of Z we will say that the congruence subgroups of F for #\r
are of level N. We know that F(A^) has no elliptic elements if AT > 2 so that if\r
we fill in the cusps of X = we get in X the structure of a compact Riemann\r
surface\r
Another interesting result, which follows inomediately from the discussion of\r
special congruence subgroups of f5'i^(2,Z[An]) in section 2.B. is:\r
Theorem 2.4.3. If p G Z is prime, we get that:\r
49

We can describe the action of the principal congruence group of level N on the\r
cusp set of r. In fact for any W [Schoe]:\r
Theorem 2.4.4. Given two cusps of F, ^ and ^ if they are expressed as\r
irreducible fractions in Q, then the equivalence condition under the action of r(A^)\r
is given by:\r
P p/ r P = # ' (mod\r
— r-^ — < and\r
- - K q = ±q' (mod N)\r
Corollary 2.4.5. The number of inequivalent cusps under the action of r(]V)\r
for jV E Z is:\r

Proof The proof follows from the above formulae as\r

The next interesting Hecke group is n = 5 and that for a number of different\r
reasons. It is together with M e {3,4,6} the only other cajse where is a\r
quadratic extension of Q, and together with M = 3 the only case where the cusp set\r
is the completed field Q(An). Unfortunately we do not have any explicit description\r
of the matrices of , although we can by-pass this problem by the use of continued\r
fractions.\r

Once we have described the cusp set of it is natural to try to answer similar\r
questions to those solved for n = 3, like finding the index of the special congruence\r
subgroups of 77^ or the action of the principal congruence subgroup for the ideal\r
7, ^^(7 ) over the cusp set of The following explicit calculation of the index\r
can be found in [CLLT].\r
Theore m 2.5.3. Given I a non-zero prime ideal of ZfAs], then:\r
if 7 = (2)\r
if/=( 2 + A5)\r
if 7 — (p) where p = ±2 (mod 5), p ^ 2\r
p + 1 in any other case.\r
positive rational prime contained in 7.\r
We will prove a theorem for the action of 77^(7) on the cusp set of 77^ that\r
is similar to the one explained for n = 3. Before doing so we need to define the\r
canonical form of a cusp of 77^.\r
Let ^ E 0(^5) be a cusp of 77^, we can find a unique expression of ^ as a\r
continued fraction of As of the form:\r
[doAsJ ,\r
[7f^ : 77^(7)]\r
where p is the\r
n\r

o^As _\r
where 0^6%. We will define a reduction process in order to construct the canonical\r
form of J. Given a finite continued fraction of the form\r
60 6n-2 ^n—1 bn\r
_ao_\r

)\r
- _\r
it is clear that the following expression represents the same number and is one step\r
smaller:\r
bo bn—l^n\r
Oo _ Q"n— 2 _ _ — 1 ~l~\r
where for technical reasons we will not allow any form of fraction simplification\r
within the last term of the expression.\r
If we apply this process to the continued fractions expansion of ^ in terms\r
of A5 aa defined in Theorem 2.5.1., what we get is a fraction (that should not be\r

Chapte r Thre e\r
Finite Geometries\r
The aim of this chapter is to introduce incidence structures, that will lead\r
to (hnite) geometries and designs. Among them we will pay special regard to\r
projective planes and biplanes, particularly to the structure of the Fano plane and\r
that of the first three biplanes, paying special attention to the biplane of order three\r
or 3-biplane.\r
Among other connections that will be explored in the next chapter, the Fano\r
plane and the 3-biplane are the Srst two examples of Hadamard designs. Most of\r
the information displayed here can be found in [HP] and [Po], as well as proofs\r
for most of the results in this chapter, unless otherwise stated.\r
3.1. Introduction\r
An or simply a is a pair of non-empty sets 7^\r
and £, which we shall call points set V and lines set C with an incidence relation\r
Is c V x jC consisting of a non-empty set of pairs (P, I) where P is a point and I a\r
line. We will assume that the structures have a finite number of points and lines,\r
that is, that they are structures.\r
If (P, Z) E ig, we say that P belongs to Z, that P and / are or that\r
(P, I) is an incidence pair. The usual name for lines in structures is blocks, but we\r
prefer lines since we will rapidly move into geometries.\r
We can represent the incidence relation Is of a finite structure S with m points\r
and n lines by a m x n matrix Ms that we call an incidence matrix of <S.\r
5 5

To construct an incidence matrix of S we need to index the points and lines\r
sets 7^ = /I = and de6ne Mg eis the matrix with coeScients\r
where i = 1,... ,m, j = 1,... ,n and:\r
1\r
0 otherwise.\r
is not uniquely determined, but it contains all the relevant information\r
about the structure (S. In fact, given Mg and two incidence matrices for the\r
same structure there are two permutation matrices (i.e. matrices so that in every\r
row and column all the coefficients are 0 except for one that is 1) A and 5" so that:\r
RMsS = Mg.\r
We will say that a finite structure is if for any two points f and\r
Q there is a sequence of incidence pairs of the form\r
[(p,o, (Pi.o . {-Pi.(i), (P2.h),... . w.;')]\r
that connects f and Q.\r
With the previous definition of structure there are some pathological cases that\r
we want to avoid:\r
- Two lines (resp. points) are if they are incident with the same set of\r
points (resp. lines), if we remove all repetitions (i.e. we get rid of aU repeated\r
elements of one kind but one), we say that we have recfucecf the structure. It is\r
clear that reducing the structure is equivalent to eliminating all repeated rows\r
and columns in the incidence matrix.\r
- We say that an element (point or line) is when it is in none or just\r
one pair of the incidence relation, and we say it is full when it is incident with\r
all the elements of the other type. We a structure if we remove\r
all isolated and full elements. On the other hand, we standardize an incidence\r
matrix when we remove all columns or rows that have either all coeScients\r
equal to zero, all coefficients but one equal to zero, or no coefEcients at all\r
equal to zero.\r
A structure is if it is reduced and standardized, we wiU caU\r
a connected totally reduced structure. This dehnition of geometry is\r
56

more restrictive than the usual one (that allows full and repeated elements) but we\r
are not interested in the anomalous cases. Although in the process of reducing or\r
standarizing a given structure <$ we might convert normal elements into repeated,\r
isolated or full elements and therefore will have to remove these elements as well,\r
the process is essentially well defined. Since the structures we Eire considering are\r
hnite, their total reduction is either the empty set or a geometry that we will call\r
Qs\u0002In a reduced structure we can consider any line / as a subset of "P, so that f\r
is incident with Z if f E Z. We will say that a structure is if all the lines\r
contain the same number of points and if all the points are incident with\r
the same number of lines, we will say that a uniform structure with A; points in\r
every line is (nmaZ if every set of A; points is incident with at least one line. A\r
is one with a hnite number of points.\r
We dehne the /Zogs (also called 6/(5 because they play a similar role to that of\r
bits in dessins) of a hnite geometry as an incidence pair, so that every pair ( f, Z) in\r
the incidence relation corresponds to a Aag.\r
Given two structures .9 and 7", an between them is a bijective map\r
from the point set of (S to the point set of 7" that induces a bijective map between\r
the line sets so that the incidence relations are preserved. An is an\r
isomorphism of a structure into itself. These dehnitions extend in a straightforward\r
way to finite geometries.\r
Since an incidence matrix contains all relevant information about a structure,\r
we can characterize isomorphic structures in terma of then: incidence matrices: two\r
structures S and T are isomorphic if and only if there are incidence matrices Ms\r
of and M-r of 7", and two permutation matrices 5" such that:\r
= M-y-.\r
From the definition of geometry and the dual nature of repeated, full and\r
isolated elements, it is clear that points and lines play an interchangeable role, and\r
if we swap points for lines in a geometry ^ we get its geometry, The use of\r
the superscript ^ describe the fact that the incidence matrix of is the transpose\r
matrix of Mg.\r

Propositio n 3.1.1. Given a geometry Q\\\r
• Q is uniform if and only if is regular.\r
. - G;.\r
We can consider as well the set of complements of the lines of a geometry ^\r
as a new set of lines, if V with this new set of lines is a geometry, we will call the\r
resulting incidence structure the of\r
Exampl e 3.1.2. Let S be the geometry with points V = {Pi, P2, Ps, lines\r
^ = {^1,^2,^3,^}, and incidence relation given by:\r
Z2-{fl,f3,a } Z3 = {Pl,P2,f4} Z4 = {f2,f3,f4 }\r
We will call its complement structure, whose incidence relation is trivially\r
given by:\r
i'i = {Pi] = {P2} 13 = {P3] 4 = {fi} .\r
If we totally reduce we end up with an empty incidence structure (since\r
every point belongs to a single line) therefore making it impossible to get the com\u0002plement geometry of\r
o/ezompZe ,9.^.,8.\r
Not e We could easily avoid the problem showed in Example 3.1.2. by changing\r
the definition of "full element" to include any element that is incident with all or all\r
but one of the elements of the other kind. The complement of a geometry deEned\r
in that way will be already a totally reduced structure, and therefore a geometry.\r
We have not done so because with that definition we would have excluded some\r
structures commonly regarded as geometries, aa <$ in the example above.\r
58

Propositio n 3.1.3. If ^ is a geometry and C its complement structure;\r
• Q is uniform if and only if C is uniform.\r
- ^ is regular if and only if C is reguleir.\r
Propositio n 3.1.4. Given Q a geometry, consider its dual geometry and\r
C its complement structure, we have:\r
Aut{Q^ = Aut(^Q'^) = Aut{C).\r
Proo f $ E is defined by a pair of bijections ((^, where\r
(j) : V —> V and (f)' : L —^ £\r
so that (f,Z) E e It is now easy to see that\r
$ E <;6) E\r
For the proof of the second part, we will consider as a subset of f oi(;er(7^),\r
the set of subsets of 7^ and dehne /Zj as the set\r
zic = {z I z = P_r , r Er} .\r
For a given element $ E eis the de6nition of is consistent\r
with the pointwise extension oi (j) : V —> V, we can define ip : Cq —>- Cq by\r
= 'P — (j)(V — I) and in that way we have proved that\r
$ = ((^, E ^ = (<^, '^) E Aut(C). O\r
A uniform geometry is called a If there are exactly A lines through\r
every ( points of a design, we say that we have a t — (f,A;,A) design, where is\r
the number of points of the design, and A; the number of points in each line. In\r
particular any ( — (t;, A;, A) design is regular. We will say that a design is sguore if\r
its incidence matrix is a square matrix, that is if there are as many lines as points\r
in the design, a square 2 — (i;, A:, A) design is called a design.\r
59

Theorem 3.1.5. In general, for a t — {v, k, X) design, if we call b the number\r
of lines in the design and r the number of lines through a point, the two following\r
equalities hold:\r
h — \\ v{v-l) ••• (w-t+1)\r
' ° .. (k-t+1)\r
• if t > 0 then bk = vr.\r
Proo f The proof is an easy counting exercise. Since every t-uple of points\r
defines A lines and from a given line we can get j ^-uples of points, the number\r
of lines is\r
k\r
t\r
The design is regular because by a similar argument the number of lines through\r
any given point is\r
A(r;\r
f k-i\r
[t-i\r
and the rest follows.\r
Propositio n 3.1.6. In a symmetric design with parameters (v, k, A), we have\r
— 1) + A\r
v =\r
A\r
Proo f For the proof we will fix a point P E V and consider all the flags of the\r
form (Q, I) where Q ^ P and P E I and we will count them in two different ways.\r
As there are r lines through f and each one contains A; points, we have r(A — 1)\r
Sags of that sort. On the other hand, there are u - 1 choices for Q and for every\r
choice there are A diEerent possibilities for Z yielding a total of A(t; — 1) Sags. Since\r
the design is symmetric f = 6 and therefore r = A;. O\r
We could also have proved Proposition 3.1.6 . as a Corollary to Theorem 3.1.5 .\r
where b = v and t = 2.\r
We will only deal with designs such that t = 2, that is, there is a fixed number\r
of lines A through every two points of the design. We will define the orcfer n, for\r
such a design as n = r — A where r is the number of lines through a point. There\r
is a general definition of order for a ( — (f, A;, A) design (where t > 2), but it is of\r
no interest for us here.\r
60

As designs are in particular geometries, the relations between a general de\u0002sign, its dual and its complement structure, follow easily from similar results about\r
structures and geometries. A more difficult question is that of the relation among\r
a ( — (?;, A;, A) design, its dual and its complement. Here we will only tackle that\r
question for square ( = 2 designs.\r
Propositio n 3.1.7. Given a symmetric design V with parameters (ii, A, A),\r
its dual is a symmetric design with the same parameters.\r
Proo f That is a design is easy to see since as D is regular (becase it is\r
symmetric), is a uniform geometry.\r
As D is symmetric, if we call 6 the number of lines and r the number of lines\r
through a point as in Theorem 3.1.5. following that theorem we get that 6 =\r
and r = A;. We still have to prove that every two lines of 7) intersect in precisely A\r
points, and we will use the incidence matrix for this part.\r
If we call the identity matrix of order f and a t; by matrix with all its\r
entries 1, we get that\r
Mj) • Afp = riy + X(Jv — ly)\r
where the element rfu on the right means that there are r lines trough each point\r
and the element A(Ju — A,) comes from the fact that any two points determine A\r
lines. It is easy to prove that\r
= (r - + (n - 1)A)\r
and since r > A > 0, Mp is an invertible matrix.\r
From there we get:\r
Mx> • • -Mp) — (-Md • • Mj) = rMx> + A ( • Mx> — Mx))\r
but\r
Ju ' — kjy — Jv — ' Jy\r
and since is non singular, we get that\r
• Mj) = fly + X{Jv ~ ly)\r
and therefore any two lines of D have precisely A points in common.\r
Theorem 3.1.8. Given a non trivial symmetric design V with parameters\r
(u, A;, A), its complement geometry is a symmetric design with the same order as D\r
and parameters (f, f — A:, f — 2A; + A).\r
61

Theore m 3.1.9. For a non trivial symmetric design of order n and parameters\r
, A;, A), we have that\r
4?i — 1 < f M + 1.\r
Proo f By Proposition 3.1.6. we have that:\r
k{k — 1) + A\r
v =\r
A\r
In this kind of design n = k — X{v = bhy symmetry, hence k = r by Theorem\r
3.1.5.) which yields:\r
. = "'"'''+ A + 2n.\r
If we consider the above expression as a function ii(A) where 1 < A < n(n — 1) (if\r
A > n(n — 1) then f (A) would be a rational number, which is impossible), we see\r
that it has a concave graph with a minimum at\r
AQ — 1^72(72 1)\r
and two maxima at\r
Ai = 1 and A2 = — 1).\r
The two natural numbers closest to Ao are (n — 1) and n, and we have that\r
?;(?%) = — 1) = 4n — 1\r
so t;(A) >471 — 1. On the other hand, for the two maxima values we get that\r
t;(l) = — n) = + n + 1\r
and therefore f (A) < + n + 1.\r
The two extreme cases of this theorem actually occur:\r
. For u = 4n — 1 we get that either the design or its complement have parameters\r
2 — (4A + 3,2A + 1, A). Any symmetric design with that set of parameters and\r
for any A is called a or simply a\r
. For II = + n + 1 we have that either the design or its complement is a\r
projective plane, as we shall see in the next section.\r
62

There is a limited amount of information regarding the existence of designs for a\r
given set of parameters ((, A;, A) or about the number of non equivalent desings for\r
one choice of parameters. The main result about non existence of square 2 — (t;, A;, A)\r
designs is (for a proof see [HP]):\r
Theorem 3.1.10. (Bruck-Ryser-Chowla ) If v, A:, A € Z satisfy\r
— 1)A = A;(A: — 1)\r
then for the existence of a symmetric (f, A;, A) design it is necessary that:\r
- If f is even then A: — A is a square.\r
If f is odd, then = (A; — A)^;^ + (—ha s a non-trivial solution in\r
integers a;, ^ and z.\r
The following corollary is very important when dealing with projective planes,\r
since it restricts the possible orders for them.\r
Corollary 3.1.11. If a symmetric design with A = 1 and order n exists, and\r
M = 1 (mod 4) or\r
n = 2 (mod 4)\r
then n can be expressed as a sum + 6^ where o, 6 E Z.\r
Proo f Since the design is symmetric and A = 1, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have\r
that\r
V = k{k — 1) + 1 = (n + l)n + 1.\r
Assume now n = 1 (mod 4) or n = 2 (mod 4), we then have = 3 (mod 4) and\r
therefore (—1) ^ = — 1 so that from the second statement in the previous theorem,\r
we have and then\r
"=4+ 4\r
a;"'\r
where n E Z. It is well known that an integer is the sum of two square\r
rationals if and only if it is the sum of two square integers. O\r
We can obtain similar results about the existence of %-designs of a given order\r
by using Hadamard matrices. A Hadamard matrix of order n is a square n by\r
n matrix H whose entries are either +1 or —1 and such that HH^ = nl. We\r
63

can define a generalized version of the permutation matrix that we have used when\r
dealing with incidence matrices, a is a square matrix\r
whose entries are ±1 or 0 and such that in each row and column all entries but one\r
are zero.\r
Theorem 3.1.12. If iJ is a Hadamard matrix of order n and i?, S are gener\u0002alized permutation matrices of order n, then H' = RHS is a Hadamard matrix of\r
order n. We will say that ^ and jif' are\r
It is clear that a class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order n is stable\r
under the action of the group of all row and column permutations and sign changes.\r
In fact, for every class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order M we can choose\r
a matrix in the class such that all entries in the first row and column are 1 (which\r
is obviously not unique for a given class). We will call such a matrix a\r
The following result impose a restriction on the order of possible Hadameird\r
matrices:\r
Theorem 3.1.13. If is a Hadamard matrix of order n then n must satisfy\r
one of the following conditions:\r
^ n = 0 (mod 4).\r
As one would suspect, there is a strong relation between Hadamard matrices\r
and ^/-designs:\r
Theorem 3.1.14. Let H he & normalized Hadamard matrix of order n > 4. If\r
we delete the first row and column of and substitute all —1 entries by 0, we obtain\r
a matrix Mg, which is an incidence matrix for a square design with parameters\r
_ n, — 2 n — 4\r
that is, a "^-design. Conversely the incidence matrix of any Hadamard 2-design for\r
a given A becomes a normalized Hadamard matrix of order 4(A + 1) by the reverse\r
procedure.\r
64

Exampl e 3.1.15. H is a, normalized Hadamard matrix of order 8, if we apply\r
the method described above to it, we get Mjrano which is an incidence matrix for a\r
square design with parameters 2 — (7,3,1) that is in fact the Fano plane and that\r
will be described in the next section.\r

As we will see, the result in this example is in fact true for any normalized\r
Hadamard matrix of order 8. By Theorem 3.1.14. any such a matrix will yield\r
an incidence matrix for a symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, whose complement is a\r
symmetric 2 — (7,4,2) (see Theorem 3.1.8.). As there is only one symmetric 2 —\r
(7,4,2) design (the 2-biplane, see the proof of Proposition 3.3.5.), there is only one\r
symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, the Fano Plane.\r
3.2. Projective planes\r
A is a geometry that satishes the following three axioms:\r
• Two distinct points are contained in a unique line.\r
• Two distinct lines intersect in a unique point.\r
• There exist four points of which no three are incident with the same line.\r
Theorem 3.2.1. A finite projective plane is the same as a symmetric design\r
(t;, A, 1) with A; > 2.\r
Proo f Given V a symmetric [v, k, 1) design, since A = 1 it is true that any two\r
distinct points are contained in a unique line, and by Proposition 3.1.7. the second\r
projective plane axiom is also true. As A: > 2, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have that\r
V = k{k — 1) + 1 > 3{k — 1) > k.\r
As > A: we can choose three points f i , fg, ^3 not in the same line, and call\r
the line incident with and It is easy to see that\r
U ^{2,3} U ^{i,3}| = 3(A; — 1)\r
65

and so we can choose a fourth point of the design so that the third axiom is also\r
satisfied.\r
To prove the reverse, we need to show that a projective plane is uniform and\r
square. We can take a line Z and a point f 0 Z. By the first and second axiom,\r
there are as many hnes incident with f as there are points in / and we shall call\r
this number k. Let us take I' any line incident with P, by the third axiom we can\r
choose Q 0 r, f " , Q' so that no three of them are incident with the same line. If\r
we call r' the line defined by f and T' has A; points, and therefore there are A\r
lines incident with Q, which means that there are A: points in T and the geometry\r
is uniform. By Theorem 3.1.5. the geometry is also squgire, and by the hrst axiom\r
^ = 2 and A = 1. O\r
We define the orcfer of a hnite projective plane as A; — 1, that is the number a,\r
such that there are n, + 1 points in each line, and M + 1 hnes through each point.\r
Corollary 3.2.2. For any symmetric {v,k,X) design with A = 1, we have that\r
A; = n + 1 and ?; = M + 1 where n is the order of the design.\r
There is an easy way to construct hnite projective planes for which we shall\r
need the following well known result about hnite helds:\r
Theorem 3.2.3. If is a finite field then \\K\\ = where p is prime and\r
r E Z, r > 1. And for any p'" as before there is a unique finite field of order p"" that\r
we shall denote\r
If we take to be a finite field, and F to be a 3 dimensional vector space\r
over K, we can define P{K) to be the structure whose points are the 1-dimensional\r
subspaces of V, and whose lines are the 2-dimensional subspaces of V, while the\r
incidence structure is given by the subspace inclusion in V.\r
Propositio n 3.2.4. P{K) is a projective plane of type 2 — (n^+ n +1, n +1,1)\r
where n —\r
Proof To define a 1-dim subspace of V we need to consider any non zero vector\r
of y , and the fact that any 1-dim subspace contains — 1 such vectors. Following\r
that we see that P{K) contains + n + 1 points.\r
Given a 2-dim subspace, it contains — 1 non zero vectors, and reasoning as\r
before we get that it contains = n + 1 1-dim subspaces, that is, each line in\r
P{K) contains n + 1 points. Obviously any two different 1-dim subspaces generate\r
66

a 2-dim subspace. The incidence structure for the projective plane follows easily\r
from the properties of a vector space.\r
Corollary 3.2.5. There is at least one projective plane of order n for any\r
n = where p is prime and r £ Z, r > 1.\r
The two main results about the existence and non-existence of projective planes\r
are Corollary 3.1.11. and the corollary above. Little is known in general for any\r
other values of n and the smallest value for which we do not know whether there\r
is a projective plane with such order is n = 10. There are many projective planes\r
that are not constructed in the way mentioned above, for more information on the\r
topic see [HP],\r
Another important issue is the calculation of the automorphism group of a\r
projective plane. Although we do not know a general way of calculating automor\u0002phism groups for an arbitrary plane, we do know it for f (TiC) when |j^| = p'' and\r
p prime. What follows is the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, that\r
can be found in many standard books on projective geometry, we will only use what\r
apphes to hnite projective planes.\r

The smallest possible non-trivial finite projective plane is the Fano f ZaMe com\u0002posed by seven points and seven lines, so that there are three points in any fine,\r
and there are three lines going through any given point, that is, it is a 2 — (7,3,1)\r
design. It corresponds to f (22)- The Fano plane is a\r
which means that any two different points of it are indistinguishable, i.e. there is\r
an automorphism of the geometry carrying one point to the other.\r
The Fano plane is the only projective plane of order 2, and it is easy to see that\r
it has 21 bits. We wiU see that its full group of automorphisms has order 168 and\r
67

it is isomorphic to PSL{2,7). For the most traditional picture of the Fano plane\r
with its Eags labelled, see ^.,8.\r
Beside being related to Z2, the Pano plane is closely related to the Snite Eeld\r
Z7. In fact, if we consider the set of quadratic residues mod 7, that is, the set\r
{1,2,4} and let the transformation z —> z + 1 (mod 7) act on the set of triples\r
of Zy, the orbit of {1, 2, 4} by this action is:\r
{1,2,4} {2,3,5} {3,4,6} {4,5,0} {5,6,1} {6,0,2} {0,1,3}\r
and if we call each of these sets a line, and consider every element M 6 Zy as a point\r
of a structure, we can see that what we get is the incidence relation of the Fano\r
plane.\r

Since the Fano plane represents a highly symmetric hypergraph, it is only\r
natural to try to 6nd ways of embedding it as a conformal structure in a highly\r
symmetric way in a surface. The optimum way of doing this will be to find an\r
embedding that keeps both its symmetries and its combinatorial properties, while\r
corresponding to a smooth embedding into a surface.\r
If we try to embed it as a regular hypermap inside a Riemann surface, it\r
is knows that it can be done in two diSerent ways, as a (3,3,3) dessin in the\r
triangular torus [Wa] or as a (3,3,7) dessin inside Klein's quartic [Si4]. Other\r
embeddings of Snite geometries in Riemann surfaces as dessing are also discussed\r
in [Si4]. Embeddings of finite geometries as regular dessins into Riemann surfaces\r
68

are closely related to the existence of big subgroups inside the automorphism group\r
of the geometry.\r
Corollary 3.2.8. The automorphism group of the Fano plane is isomorphic\r
to:\r
f ^1,(2, 7)\r
which is the simple group of order 168.\r
Proof Immediate from Corollary 3.2.7. and the fact that (for a proof see for\r
example [Di])\r
fGi:(3,2 ) ^f^i;(2,7) .\r
3.3. Biplanes\r
A generalization of finite projective planes arises naturally when we allow two\r
lines to intersect in more than a point (respectively when we allow two points to\r
dehne more than one line), if A is the number of points that belong to two different\r
lines, we will call these generalization (6%- and (n- for the cases A = 2, 3).\r
So a is a symmetric geometry that satisfies the following two axioms:\r
- Two distinct points are contained in exactly two distinct lines.\r
- Two distinct lines intersect in exactly two distinct points.\r
Finite biplanes have been much less studied than standard projective planes,\r
and we only know 17 different examples of them [Po]. We will associate with every\r
biplane its order, which is the number n such that every line of it has n +2 points. As\r
far as we know nobody has tried to End smooth embeddings of biplanes in Riemann\r
surfaces before. The 17 known biplanes have orders in the set {1,2,3,4,7,9,11}.\r
By Theorem 3.1.10. there are no biplanes of orders {5,6,8}. The Erst example of a\r
biplane is a 2 — (4,3,2) design, which is a biplane of order 1. It is immediate to see\r
that there is only one possible incidence structure for such a biplane where every\r
line is determined by the only point not belonging to it. The biplane of order 1 has\r
= 12 Sags and can be embedded into the sphere, since we can see it as a regular\r
map of type (3,2,3) i.e. a tetrahedron. For two diSerent pictures of the biplane of\r
order 1 see ,9.J. We have already seen that its complement is not a geometry\r
in Example 3.1.2.\r
69

The second example of a biplane is a 2 — (7,4,2) design which corresponds to\r
biplanes of order 2. We will later see that there is only one possible incidence struc\u0002ture for biplanes of order 2 and 3 (see Theorem 3.3.3. and the proof of Proposition\r
3.3.5.), although that is not the case for biplanes of higher orders, as there Eire 3\r
biplanes of order 4 [Hus], and 4 biplanes of order 7 [MS].\r
The biplane of order 2 is the complement of the Fane plane, it has 7 points and\r
7 lines, but there are four points in each line making a total of 28 bits. Its group\r
of automorphisms is again f 5'Z,(2, 7) (see Proposition 3.1.4. or Proposition 3.3.5.)\r
and it is a 2 — (7,4, 2) design. For a picture of this biplane see .9.^. where the\r
thick circle is highlighted because it also meets the central vertex.\r
^.6". on (Ae pZone OMcZ oa o deggm m (/le gp/iere\r
Since there is no subgroup of f 5'i,(2,7) of index 6, it is not possible to embed\r
this structure as a regular hypermap or hypergraph into a Riemann surface with\r
PSL{2, 7) as its automorphisms group. Nevertheless, we will show an alternative\r
representation of its incidence structure into Klein's Riemann surface in chapter\r
four.\r
The biplane we are most interested in is the biplane of order 3, which has\r
11 points and 11 lines, and Eve points in each line making a total of 55 bits. Its\r
full group of automorphisms has order 660 and is isomorphic to f5'i^(2,11). Since\r
it is the only biplane of order three, we will refer to it as the 3-biplane. It is a\r
2 - (11,5,2) design.\r
The 3-biplane is related to the quadratic residue classes of Z n in precisely\r
the same way as the Fano plane with Zy. That is, if we take the set of quadratic\r
residues mod 11, A = {1,3,4,5,9} and construct eleven sets of five elements by\r
70

considering the action oi 4> •. z i—> z + 1 (mod 11), we can regard the elements\r
n G Zii as points of the 3-biplane where the lines are represented by where\r
r e Zii.\r
To calculate automorphism groups of biplanes we need to introduce Hussain\r
graphs [Hus]. We will see their importance when dealing with the automorphism\r
group of the 3-biplane. A is a graph associated to any line Z in a\r
biplane B and any point Q 0 Z. The vertices of the graph are those of the line Z,\r
and two vertices f , f G Z are joined by an edge of the Hussain graph if and only if\r
there is a line of the biplane through P, P' and Q.\r

We will use the notation Z-Hussain set (or simply Z-H) to refer to the set of\r
Hussain graphs associated with the line I and [Q, /]-Hussain graph (or [Q, Z]-H) to\r
71

refer to a particular graph in the /-Hussain set. The importance of Hussain graphs\r
is that a line Z E B and the whole set of Z-Hussain graphs completely determine the\r
biplane B, for a proof see Theorem 3.34 in [HP].\r
We will say that the Hnssain graphs [Q,Z]-H and [Q%Z']-H are isomorphic, if\r
they are isomorphic as graphs. Two Z-Hussain sets Z-H and Z'-H are isomorphic if\r
there is a bijection from the point set of Z-H to the point set of Z'-H that induces\r
isomorphisms between their graphs.\r
Propositio n 3.3.1. Given a biplane B and a line I G B any two /-Hussain\r
graphs share exactly two edges and these two edges do not share a vertex. Further\u0002more, every Hussain graph is a divalent graph.\r
Proo f Let us choose two points Q', Q ^ L since 5 is a biplane, there are two\r
lines through Q and Q' that we will call Zi and Z2. Four new points appear when\r
we consider the intersections Zi n Z = {^1,^2}, Z2 H Z = where ^ if\r
% ^ J, since otherwise Zi and Z2 will have more than two points in common.\r
It is immediate to see now that fif z and ^3^4 are two shared edges by [Q, Z]-H\r
and Z]-H and that they do not share a vertex. If there were a third common\r
edge, that will mean that there is a third line through Q and Q' different from Zi\r
and Z2, in contradiction to the fact that B is a biplane.\r
Given f any vertex in [Q,Z]-H, there are only two hnes going through f and\r
Q and each one deSnes an edge of f , therefore any vertex has only two edges and\r
the graph is divalent.\r
Corollary 3.3.2. A [Q, Z]-Hussain graph is a disjoint union of polygons whose\r
vertices are the points of Z.\r
Proo f Immediate since the graph is divalent.\r
Theorem 3.3.3. Two biplanes B and B' are isomorphic if and only if for any\r
line Z E B there is a line Z' E such that the Z-Hussain set is isomorphic to the\r
/'-Hussain set.\r
Proo f Take / G 5 to be a line, and (j) : V —>- V the bijection between the\r
point sets induced by the isomorphism.\r
We will call Z' = (^(Z) and assume Q a point of B and Q 0 Z. Let us call\r
Q' = a]:id choose E Z so that the edge ^1^2 is in [Q,Z]-H. That means\r
that there is a third line h in B so that {Pi,P2,Q) E Zi, which in turns mean\r
72

that are points of the set that is a hne in B', since is\r
an isomorphism. Therefore the edge is in and the graphs are\r
isomorphic.\r
Let us assume now that there are two sets Z-H and I'-Yi that are isomorphic\r
and that ^ : Z-H —> Z'-H is the bijection between the point sets of Z and Z' that\r
defines the isomorphism, so we have aheady dehned the images of any point in Z.\r
Take Q 0 Z a point of B, ^ takes [Q, Z]-H to a graph in Z'-H that we call [Q', Z']-H,\r
so that we can define ^(Q) = Q' and therefore we have extended the definition of ^\r
to a bijection of the whole point set of B. All we need to prove is that it preserves\r
the incidence structure.\r
That takes lines to lines is clear, since given a line Zi in B diSerent from Z,\r
we know that Zi n Z = {^1,^2} and taking Q E Zi and Q 0 Z, as [Q,Z]-H goes to\r
[Q%Z']-H, there must be a line Z^ through and diSerent from Z', and\r
so we call i/'(Zi) = Z^. We have then a bijection of the point set that preserves the\r
lines and the incidence relation.\r
Corollary 3.3.4. Given B and B' two biplanes, and lines I G B and V G i?',\r
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphisms : jB —\r
such that (^(Z) = Z' and the set of isomorphisms of Hussain sets taking Z-H to Z'-H.\r

Proo f Let us call Bi, B2 and B3 the biplanes of order 1, 2 and 3. As\r

73

we see that the orientation preserving and orientation reversing symmetries of the\r
tetrahedron are an automorphism of Bi, therefore = ^'4.\r
For B2 we use the fact that B2 is the complement of the Fano plane, and\r
Proposition 3.1.4. In that way Aut{B2) = Aut{Fano) = PSL{2,7). We could as\r
well have calculated ^1/^(^2) using its set of Z-H graphs, if we had done so we would\r
have seen that ther is only one way of drawing an Z-H set (see for a 2\r
biplane, and therefore by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one biplane of order 2.\r
Finally for ^ 3 we need to consider its /-Hussain graphs. A divalent graph on\r
five points must be a pentagon, and there are only Ave ways of drawing a divalent\r
graph on five vertices so that it shares exactly two non consecutive edges with the\r
pentagon. The six elements of any Z-Hussain graph of B3 can be seen in f g.\r
Since there is only one way of representing an Z-H set, all the Z-Hussain graphs\r
are isomorphic, (and hence, by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one possible biplane\r
of order three) and there are automorphisms of B3 taking any line to any other\r
line, i.e. the automorphism group is transitive in the line set, and therefore in the\r
set of Z-H sets. Furthermore, we will see that the group of automorphism of an Z-H\r
set is isomorphic to A5:\r
It must be a subgroup of ^'5 but it does not contain any transpositions or\r
4-cycles, since the action of both transpositions and 4-cycles always Sx two consec\u0002utive edges of the pentagon, therefore it is a subgroup of A5. If we consider the\r
action of a 3-cycle we see that all of them are automorphisms of the set of Z-Hussain\r
graphs, so the stabiliser of any Z-H set is in fact ^^5. As there are 11 lines in B3 and\r
the action is transitive, \\Aut{B3) \\ = 660.\r
We will now show that Aut{Bz) is simple, and since there is only one simple\r
group of order 660, that will prove that Aut{Bs) = PSL{2,11).\r
Take Z a line of B3, as the automorphism group of the Z-H set is isomorphic to\r
the alternating group A5, by Corollary 3.3.4. we get that\r
StabiV) = A^.\r
Furthermore, since ^^((Bs) is transitive on the set of lines, aU the stabihzers are\r
conjugate and ^fa6(Z) ^^1/^(^3) for any Z E /Zg,.\r
Let us assume that G = C n and Go^^^(53). For this to happen there must\r
be only one 11-Sylow subgroup in ^^((Bs). Since any two lines Z, Z' share two\r

on the other hand, given Z and Z' two hnes, there are precisely three other lines Zj\r

we can count all elements of order different to 11 by using the previous facts, and\r

There are a number of reasons that justify the study of the biplane of order\r
three: the biplane provides a geometrical model for the action of PSL{2,11) in\r
the same way as the icosahedron and the Fano plane are models for PSL{2,5)\r
and f 6'Z,(2,7) respectively, therefore throwing some hght into the structure of the\r
group. As a result of this similarity it is possible to find embeddings for the trun\u0002cated icosahedron in a Riemann surface (using the same idea that allows us to\r
embed a truncated cube in Klein's Riemann surface). Finally, both the combinato\u0002rial structure of the 3-biplane and that of the vertices of the truncated icosahedron\r
correspond to the combinatorial structure of the cusps of certain congruence sub\u0002groups of the Hecke group Some of the ideas developed in this work were found\r
in [KG] ,\r

Chapte r Four\r
Embedding of finite Geometries\r
In this chapter we will explore several embeddings of the Fano plane and the\r
3-biplane inside a Riemann surface, together with other geometric structures that\r
are related to them, such as the truncated cube and the truncated icosahedron.\r
The Fano plane can be embedded as a regular hypermap in the torus and in Klein's\r
quartic. These are the only embeddings of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap\r
in a Riemann surface.\r
We will also discuss two diSFerent kind of embeddings of the 3-biplane:\r
- as a regular hypermap inside a Riemann surface, there are two possibilities,\r
inside a surface of genus ^ = 12 and a surface of genus p = 15.\r
- as a bipartite graph, there are three possibilities, inside a surface with genus\r
^ = 70, a surface with genus g — 125 and a surface with genus p = 180 We will\r
only cover the first two cases in this work.\r
Each of the two embeddings of the 3-biplane as a graph that we are going to\r
study here generalizes different aspects of the Fano plane embeddings mentioned\r
above. Using them we will explore some interesting relationships among the groups\r
_P5'-L(2,])) where E {5, 7, 11}.\r

4.A. The Fano plane as a dessin\r
Since we know that the Fano plane has 21 bits, in order to embed it as a regular\r
hypermap, we need to find an epimorphism from a triangle group A = [Z, m, n] into\r
a group of order 21 such that its kernel is torsion free. The torsion free kernel\r
condition together with the fact that the Fano plane has no automorphism of order\r
21 forces {f, C {3, 7}.\r
On the other hand, we have already seen in chapter two that there are only\r
two non-isomorphic groups of order 21, one of them is the cyclic group C21, and the\r
other one is the semidirect product C? x C3 which we call G21 and that is dehned\r
by the presentation:\r
< e , / I = e/e- = 1 >\r
where we will assume u = 2 without loss of generality.\r
It is clear that there is no surface kernel epimorphism from the triangle group\r
A = Ti] (where {/, m, G {3, 7}) into C21 since there should be an element\r
in A of order 21, which contradicts the assumptions, so we only need to consider\r
G21 as the image of the epimorphism. Since C7 < G21, there is only one subgroup\r
of order 7 in G21, and thus there are only two possible triangle groups for the\r
epimorphism, either [3,3,3] or [3,3, 7]. We will see that both of them produce an\r
embedding of the Fano plane.\r
4.1. The Fano plane in the torus\r
This embedding was found by Walsh in 1975 [Wa] and corresponds to a regular\r
hypermap on a torus. It is related to the toroidal embedding of the complete graph\r
jiTy. We start by getting a presentation for [3, 3,3] given by:\r
< 0 , 6, c I = a6c = 1 >\r
where we can dehne the epimorphism (^ : [3,3,3] —G2 1 by ((921 presented as\r
above):\r
<^(a) = e (^(6) = <^(c) =\r
and using Riemann-Hurwitz formula it is easy to see that A!'er((^) has signature\r
(1; ). It is therefore a torsion free group and corresponds to a torus that we\r
77

shall call T. For a picture of a Walsh representation of the embedding see Fig. 4-1-\r
where the torus is marked with the thin continuous line.\r
It is easy to calculate the modulus of this torus, which is r = The auto\u0002morphism group of any regular map Ai on the torus is hnite and described\r
in [CM], while the automorphism group of any torus T is continuous and\r
hence inhnite. If we calculate for this torus, it turns out that is\r
isomorphic to the groups quotient where ^ is the subgroup of generated\r
by the transformations:\r

Fig. 4-i- Walsh embedding of the Fano plane\r
4.2. The Fano plane in Klein's quartic\r
This embedding was fouud by D. Singerman [Si4] in 1986. It corresponds\r
to an embedding of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap of type (3,3, 7) into a\r
Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to the automorphism group\r
of the Fano Plane. It is therefore an embedding into a highly symmetric surface.\r
As before we will assume that the presentation of [3,3,7] and that of G21 are\r
respectively:\r
< a, 6, c I = 06c = 1 > < e, / I = / ^ = = 1 >\r
78

Our starting point is an epimorphism 4> '• [3, 3, 7] —G2 1 defined by\r
= e (^(6) = (^(c) =\r
and by Riemann-Hurwitz formula we see that the signature of jirer(<^) is (3; ),\r
we will call ^"^=3 the Riemann surface uniformized by\r
[3,3,7] is not a maximal triangle group, since it can be embedded into [2,3,7],\r
which is maximal [Si2], with index 8. If we consider a presentation for [2,3,7] of\r
the form\r
< A, B,C j A'^ = = ABC = 1 >\r
one of the possible set of equations (there are eight ways of doing the embedding)\r
for the embedding z : [3,3,7] —[2,3,7 ] is :\r
z(c) = ^C.4\r
where we can check that z(o6c) = = 1.\r
In order to calculate the automorphism group of ^"^=3 we need to End the\r
normalizer of 7irer(<^) inside f 6'i/(2, R). We will show that < [2,3,7], and\r
since [2,3, 7] is a maximal triangle group (see [Si2]), we will have proved that it is\r
the normahzer of A^er((^). That fact will prove that ^g=3 is Klein's quartic.\r

and we choose a representation of G21 as < f 5'i^(2,7) where\r
'=( 0 5 ) ^=( 0 1\r
79

with the above presentations we see that = $(z(a;)) for any a; E [3,3,7]. As the\r
index of A'er((^) inside [2,3,7] is 168 we know that A'er(i^) — A'er($) and therefore\r
^er(^ ) < [2,3,7]. We have then proved that\r
^ f gz;(2,7)\r
and that characterizes as Klein's quartic, which we can express in complex\r
projective coordinates as [Kll]:\r
3:^2/ + 2/^^ + = 0.\r
The eight different embeddings of [3,3,7] into [2,3,7] correspond to the eight\r
diEerent embeddings of a Ggi into fSZ,(2,7), each one corresponding to\r
for a given a; G Py. Since we have already chosen we get the stack of groups\r
shown in the previous page, where (7(7^=3) has been explicitly calculated by\r
Klein in [Kll].\r
In the diagram firom the previous page refers to the automorphism\r
group of the dessin, while 5" refers to the stabilizer of the face centres of the dessin,\r
the horizontal lines on the left are group epimorphisms, those on the right are group\r
isomorphisms, and vertical arrows designate group inclusions.\r
We will only show the embedding that corresponds to in our notation\r
because as we have said, the others are conjugate to it by automorphisms of the\r
surface.\r
In order to display the hypermap on the surface, we need to consider 21 special\r
points on kg=s, and for simplicity we will refer to < Aut{kg=^) as h when\u0002ever there is no confusion possible. The action of each subgroup of order seven of\r
j4u((7irg=3) Axes three points on the surface ([Kll] or direct calculation), and there\r
are not two subgroups that fix the same point, so if we consider all the points Exed\r
by each of these subgroups, we get 24 distinguished points, which are actually the\r
Weierstrass points of Klein's quartic.\r
As every triple of points corresponds to the action of a Cy group, and every C?\r
in f 5'iy(2,7) can be associated to a point in Py, we can see that the action of\r
on the Weierstrass points splits them into two stable sets, one of them with three\r
points in it (those Sxed by the other with 21. We can see the 6rst set as the\r
face centres of our dessin on the surface, while the second set corresponds to the\r
80

set of bits of the dessin. For a Cori representation of the embedding see ^.,9.\r
where the identiScation of the edges of the polygon follows the rule\r
2M + 1^2 n + 6 (mod 14) where\r
o/(Ae fono p/ane\r
The lighter coloured hyperbolic triangles in represent hypervertices\r
while the darker ones are hyperedges of the dessin, the black points show the bits\r
and the three face centres of the dessin are highlighted with a light coloured circle.\r
4.3. On the Fano plane and Klein's quartic\r
The embedding of the Fano plane into is also interesting for its relation\u0002ship with the cusp set of the principal congruence subgroup of the modular group\r
of level seven, its relationship with the embedding of the truncated cube in ]irg=3\r
and the possibility of providing a geometrical model for the 2-biplane.\r
We have already mentioned in chapter two that the cusp set of the modular\r
group r is Q, that r(# ) is torsion free for every > 2 and that\r
where p E Z is prime. We can actually use a stack of groups similar to the one\r
displayed in previous sections to calculate the cusp set of the action of the principal\r
congruence group of level seven, r(7) over ZY with the structure of the Fano plane.\r
81

It is clear that there is an epimorphism from F into [2, 3, 7], since a presentation\r
for r is given by\r
< X, y, z I = x y z = i > .\r
We can easily define it by projecting X onto A, Y onto B and Z onto C\r
(where [2,3,7] is presented as in section 4.2.), we will call such epimorphism cr. If\r
we consider the special congruence subgroups of level seven, we get the following\r
stack:\r
r ^ > [2,3,7]\r
^8 ^8\r
ro(7) > [3,3,7]\r
T3 T3\r
ri(7) > [7,7,7]\r
17 T?\r
r(7) > ks,,3\r
Where is a Riemann surface of genus g = 3 with 24 punctures.\r
We will follow Klein in [Kll] to obtain a picture of a fundamental region of\r
r(7 ) in the upper-half plane with a triangulation by triangles of type [2,3, oo]. To\r
do so we use the transformation z i—> z + 1 to generate six copies of J. (as\r
described in [Kll]) and paste them together along consecutive vertical sides. That\r
leaves us with a hyperbolic polygon with vertices:\r
ib3 -|- 7n i l 3ti ih2 -t- In —1 -t- In\r
7 ' 3 ' 7 ' 2 ' ^\r
where M 6 {0, ..., 6}.\r
As we know, the punctures on the surface of correspond to points fixed\r
by parabolic elements, and all parabolic elements in F project by cr onto elements\r
of order seven in [2,3, 7], therefore the 24 punctures will project onto the 24 Weier\u0002strass points of -^^^=3. Reversing the reasoning, as the projection is one to one,\r
the cusp set of inherits the Pano plane structure defined using the Weierstrass\r
points of A7g=3. This embedding, although being very closely related to the one in\r
is more interesting, since we can use arithmetic to describe the Pano plane\r
structure in the set of punctures of r(7).\r
82

We will now obtain the set of cusps of oiit of the set of vertices of a\r
fundamental region of r(7) described above.\r
z+l\r
Fzp. ^.,9. o/r(7) 6^ [2,3,oo].\r
By Theorem 2.4.4. two irreducible fractions ^ and ^ represent the same cusp\r
under the action of r(7) if and only if a = ± a ' (mod 7) and b = ±b' (mod 7),\r
and we therefore see that either a cusp is equal to oo, ^ or it belongs to one of\r
the following families;\r
n,\r
1 + 3n 1 + 2n\r
3 ' 2\r
where ft 6 {0, ..., 6}. Since the hrst three cusps are hxed by the action of z i—^ z + l\r
and thus correspond to the face centres of the Fano plane embedding associated to\r
the other 21 cusps constitute the bits of that same embedding.\r
We will prove that for this embedding two cusps ^ and ^ in their irreducible\r
form share an edge if and only if\r
ah' — a'b = ±1 (mod 7).\r
We assume that the condition holds for a couple of cusps ^ and ^ sharing an\r
edge. If we let the order seven element act on the shared edge, we get new edges\r
83

defined by the couples\r
o + nb + Mb'\r
where 1 < n < 6 and all of them trivially satisfy the condition.\r
On the other hand, any order three element\r
A = ( : ^ I E Gzi\r
^ y \\ r\u00020 z\r
satishes = ± 1 (mod 7), and if we assume ^ and ^ to be two cusps as before,\r
it is trivial to see that\r
za + 2/6\r
also satisfy the condition.\r
It sufhces to show that there is at least one edge that satisSes the condition:\r
let us take the bit represented by 0, an edge of the embedding can only join it to\r
the following points\r
^ 2 ' ^ 3 '\r
The last four points must be discarded since any edge connecting them to 0\r
will imply that two hypervertices (or hyperedges) share a bit, which is impossible.\r
On the other hand, there are precisely four edges incident to any one bit, and in\r
this case the four edges are represented by the Erst four points. It is now trivial to\r
check that any of them satis6es the condition above.\r
4.4. Embeddings related to PSL(2,7)\r
In this section we want to study other geometric structures that can be de\u0002scribed in terms of the embedding covered in sections 4.2. and 4.3. As we have\r
already seen that Klein's quartic is equivalent to without considering its punc\u0002tures, we will only consider the description of the embeddings into Klein's quartic,\r
their extension to the cusp set of should follow easily.\r
The other "big" subgroup of f 5'Z,(2,7) has 24 elements and is isomorphic to\r
5'4, we will show its relationship to the 24 Weierstrass points of Klein's quartic. In\r
the previous section we were forced to split the set of Weierstrass points into two\r
subsets, mainly because we were considering the action of a group of order 21, in\r
this section we will study the action of ^'4 over the set of Weierstrass points and in\r
order to do that we require the following lemma.\r
84

Lemm a 4.4.1. There are fourteen groups of order 24 (isomorphic to S4)\r
inside PSL{2, 7). The action of any of these groups, when considered as subgroups\r
of Aut{Kg=z)i on the Weierstrass points of is transitive.\r
Proo f The first part follows from [Di], was proved in [Kll] and has been\r
calculated in section 2.2. For the second part, we only need to consider that each\r
Wierstrass point in Kg=z is the fixed point of a unique C7 < PSL{2, 7) and that\r
any proper subgroup of PSL{2,7) whose order is a multiple of 7 is isomorphic to\r
either C7 or G21 [Kll]. Thus the only elements in S4 that could fix a Wierstrass\r
point are those of order three.\r
Fig. 4-4• Embedding of the truncated cube in K,g=3\r
On the other hand, any element of order three is associated to two C7 groups\r
and therefore it fixes their corresponding sets of Wierstrass points (although it does\r
not fix the actual points). Since any element of order three fixes just two points on\r
Kg=3, it is immediate that it cannot fix a Wierstrass point, therefore the stabilizer\r
of any point is trivial (when considering the action of an S4) and the action of S'4\r
on the set of Weierstrass points is transitive. •\r
Every embedding of an ^4 into PSL{2,7) is related to an embedding of a\r
truncated cube into Kg=3 in which the Weierstrass points of Kg=3 are the vertices\r
of the truncated cube. We can choose one of the groups S4 displayed in the table\r
85

in chapter two, each one containing four subgroups isomorphic to C3. The action\r
of any C3 < on ^(^^=3 Exes two points on the surface, therefore to every\r
embedding of an into f 5'Z,(2, 7) we can attach four pairs of points on the surface\r
of Klein's quartic, each of these pairs will define a diagonal of the (truncated) cube.\r
Each point hxed by an element of order three is the centre of an equilateral\r
triangle of area y whose vertices are three Weierstrass points (since they are fixed by\r
elements of order 7). In that way we get a triangle corresponding to the truncation\r
of one vertex of the cube for every point hxed by an element of order three in the ^'4\r
we are considering (i.e. two triangles for each C3). Repeating the same operation\r
with every subgroup C3 in ^'4 we get the eight triangular faces of the truncated\r
cube. The remaining edges of the truncated cube are easy to And, since every two\r
cycle of 5'4 will hx two other points on the surface, these points correspond to edges\r
centres of the cube. For a picture of a truncated cube inside J^g=3 see\r
There are fourteen such embeddings into two conjugacy classes, but if we allow\r
orientation reversing automorphism of ^7^=3 they will form a unique conjugacy\r
class. To visualize the remaining six embeddings in class it suSces\r
to rotate the truncated cube around the center point of the hyperbohc polygon\r
shown in To get a representative of the second class, we have to reAect\r
the truncated cube along the vertical diagonal of the polygon. To hnish with this\r
section we intend to provide a model for the geometric action of f5'Z'(2, 7) on seven\r
points alongside with a model for the 2-biplane inside Kg=2.\r
The algebraic action of f 5'i^(2, 7) on seven points is easy to describe as the\r
action of PSL{2, 7) on its seven subgroups isomorphic to S4 within one conjugacy\r
class. Considering that every ^'4 in ^t(^(A'g=3) is connected to an embedding of the\r
86

truncated cube, we can see the geometric action of f6'i,(2,7) on seven points as\r
the permutation of the seven truncated cubes in a conjugacy class.\r
For a diagram of the 14 truncated cubes inside we only need to rotate\r
the class representatives displayed in ^.,5. around the central vertex of the\r
hyperbolic polygon.\r
We can now consider the diagonals of each truncated cube in a conjugacy class\r
as a bit of a combinatorial structure and thus we get 28 bits in seven sets of four. We\r
can call each of these sets /meg, so that each line is in fact a truncated cube within a\r
conjugacy class. Furthermore, we can choose seven new sets of four diagonals, that\r
we shall call so that every point shares only a bit with four lines, and every\r
line shares just one bit with four points. In doing so what we get is a model for\r
the 2-biplane inside -^^^=3. We have seen that each diagonal can be associated to a\r
C3 < f 5'JL(2,7) and that the set of "lines" is identified with the set of subgroups\r
5'4 in one conjugacy class. Using a similar reason, the set of "points" is identified\r
with the set of subgroups ^'4 in the other conjugacy class, as we can see in the table\r
in chapter two, where f stands for points and 2, for lines, and the coordinates of\r
the C3 label the incidence structure of the bits of the 2-biplane.\r
87

4.B. The 3-biplane as a dessin\r
The 3-biplaiie has 55 bits, so to embed it as a regular hypermap our Erst concern\r
is the structure of the groups of order 55. We have already seen in chapter two\r
that there are only two groups of order 55: the cyclic group C55 and the semidirect\r
product Cii x C5 that we call G55 and has a presentation:\r
where E {3,4,5,9}. We shall use w = 4 unless otherwise stated.\r
Using the same ideas explained in the study of the embeddings of the Fano\r
plane, we can discard C55 (there is no subgroup of f 11) isomorphic to C55)\r
and state that there are only two possible embeddings for the 3-biplane as a regular\r
hypermap, these embeddings arise when we consider the triangle groups [5, 5,5] and\r
[5,5,11].\r
4.5. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=i2\r
This embedding corresponds to a hypermap of type [5,5,5] inside a Riemann\r
surface of genus ^ = 12. It arises when one consider the group [5, 5,5] with presen\u0002tation\r
< G, 6, c I = a6c = 1 >\r
and the epimorphism : [5,5,5] —G5 5 dehned by:\r
(^(o) = e (^(6) = / e (^(c) =\r
that induces the following stack of groups.\r
[5,5,5] ^ > G55\r
T5 T5\r
(2;_) > Cii\r
111 Til\r
> {1}\r
[5,5,5] is not a maximal triangle group because it satisfies [Si2]\r
[5,5, 5] < [3,3,5] < [2,3,10] or [5, 5,5] < [2,5,10]

and there are no other inclusions for [5, 5, 5]. As it is not maximal, we need to do\r
some extra calculations to find Aut{Rg=i2)-\r
If we take [2,5,10] with presentation\r
< v4, g , C I = 1 >\r
we can define the inclusion % : [5,5, 5] —[2,5,10 ] by\r
%((i) — vlBA, g z(c) =\r
Let us consider a group isomorphic to T^no (defined as in Lemma 2.A.6.) with\r
presentation:\r
< e, /, g I = 1 >\r
and the map $ : [2, 5,10] —>- ^ n o given by:\r
$(A) = $(B) = / e $(C) - V "\r
which we can prove to be an epimorphism since $(ylC) = We can see that\r
A'er($) is torsion free in the usual way. If we calculate the restriction of $ to [5,5,5],\r
we see that for any z 6 [5, 5,5] and using indexes calculations as we\r
have done before, < [2,5,10]. As [2,5,10] is a maximal triangle group, we\r
have proved that\r
Aut{Rg=^i2) — Hiio\u0002Since [2,5,10] is a triangle group, we can consider the dessin induced by the\r
inclusion jirer(<^) < [2, 5,10] which is a dessin with 110 bits that derives from the\r
3-biplane embedding by a standard procedure that we call We can\r
obtain a geometric representation of a Walsh double of a hypermap by taking its\r
Walsh representation and painting all vertices black, the bipartite map we get is a\r
Walsh double of the original hypermap.\r
4.6. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=i5\r
This embedding appears when one consider the triangle group [5,5,11] with\r
presentation\r
< o, 6, c I = a6c = 1 >\r
and the epimorphism : [5, 5,11] —G5 5 given by:\r
e <^(6) = e / <^(c) = /.\r
89

Using Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we see that the underlying Riemann surface\r
has genus ^ — 15 and we get the following group diagram:\r
[5,5,11] G55\r
T5 T5\r
(0;[ll5]) ^ Cn\r
^11 %11\r
A'er(i;6) > {1}\r
As in the previous case [5,5,11] is not a majcimal triangle group [Si2], and is\r
not contained in any other triangle group except:\r
[5,5,11] < [2,5,22].\r
We will prove nevertheless that = 55.\r
Using the same ideas as before, we suppose there is a torsion free kernel epi\u0002morphism $ : [2,5,22] —> where jif is a group such that [ ^ : Gss] = 2.\r
Since ^ must have an element of order 22, ^ 9^no- On the other hand, if\r
^ = Giio = G55 X Cg, must have order ten, where and B are respec\u0002tively elements of order two and five in [2,5,22], and therefore it is impossible to\r
dehne such an epimorphism, so we have proved that\r
Aut{Rg=l^) = G55.\r
90

4.C. The 3-biplane as a confbrmal graph\r
The two examples mentioned above Eire the only possible embeddings of a 3-\r
biplane as a regular dessin in a Riemann surface, as any other epimorphism from a\r
triangle group n] to G55 will produce torsion. Unfortunately none of them is\r
into a Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to f ,9jL(2,11).\r
Since we are trying to End embeddings of the 3-biplane that mirror as closely\r
as possible the characteristics of Singerman's embedding of the Pano plane, there\r
Eire two important questions that we need to solve:\r
- Is there any other way of embedding the 3-biplane in a "rigid way" into a\r
Riemann surface 5" such that v4M^(5') = f 5'i,(2,11)? That is, is it possible to embed\r
the bipartite graph representing the 3-biplane incidence structure conformally into\r
a Riemann surface S such that Ai6((5') = f 5'Z,(2,11) and so that the stabilizer of\r
the embedding is isomorphic to G55?\r
- Among the solutions to the previous question, can any of the surfaces 5" be\r
uniformized by a principal congruence group of a Hecke group in such a way\r
that the bits of the embedding can be thought of as cusps of G?\r
The answer to both questions is ahrmative, there are at least two surfaces 5^\r
that solve the 6rst question, and one of them is a positive answer to the second.\r
We need to relax some of the conditions for the embedding, since we know that\r
there is no solution for it among dessins. We chose to relax the conditions relating\r
to the "faces" of the embedding (as seen in a Walsh representation), therefore our\r
embedding will not be a dessin, but only a bipartite graph, since the connected com\u0002ponents of the complement of the graph (faces) will no longer be simply connected.\r
This relaxation implies algebraically that we will consider groups A' with three pe\u0002riods and signature where ^ ^ 0, as candidates for the epimorphism\r
onto G55. Unfortunately these groups are not rigid in the sense of Fuchsian groups,\r
and so we will place a restriction on them by studying only those that are subgroups\r
of triangle groups [(,m, that projects epimorphicaily onto f^i/(2,11).\r
Let us start then with a triangle group A = [/,m, that projects epimorphi\u0002cally via $ onto PSL(2,11) so that its kernel has index 660 and is torsion free. The\r
torsion free kernel condition limits the choice of periods for the triangle group to\r
the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11}. We need to impose a further condition: that there is a\r
subgroup A' < A with [A : A'] = 12 and signature\r
A = < g, [li, I21 ^3]\r
91

that is, three finite periods {U ^ 0) such that the restriction is an epimorphism\r
onto G55. This implies that A' has one of the following signatures:\r
= or A' = (g;[5,5,5])\r
which implies that there is at least a period of order multiple of 5 in A, using the\r
condition that limits the choice of periods in A, we can eissume that A = [5,\r
Since the index of A' in A is 12, we have that 12//(A) = //(A'), that is:\r
5 55 \\5m n\r
where m , » E {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11} and ^ E N. Out of the set of hyperbolic triangle\r
groups that could be candidates for A, we can see that only [2,5,11], [3,5,11] and\r
[5,6,11] satisfy all the conditions, and therefore are the only ones that might allow\r
an embedding of the kind described above.\r
In the first case ([2,5,11]), which seems to be the most interesting, the embed\u0002ding will be into a Riemann surface of genus p = 70. In that case we will be able\r
to extend the 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of a congruence subgroup of the\r
Hecke group\r
In the second case the underlying surface has genus p = 125, while in the leist\r
case A' has signature (3; [5,5,11]) and the underlying surface has genus p = 180. In\r
all three cases the bipartite graph has type (5,5,11) meaning that it is invariant by\r
rotations of order eleven around its "face" centres, or rotations of order 6ve around\r
its vertices. We will only cover the Erst two cases as the third one does not show\r
any interesting properties not covered by the other two cases.\r
4.7. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=70\r
In this section we will explain the embedding of the 3-biplane that most closely\r
resembles that of the Fano plane in Klein's quartic. We start with the triangle group\r
[2, 5,11] with the following presentation:\r
< A, B, C I = A BC = 1 >\r
and we dehne a map $ : [2,5,11] —> f 6'Z,(2,11) by:\r
92

It is clear that is torsion free, since every Enite order element in [2,5,11]\r
is projected onto an element of f5'i^(2,ll) of the same order, thus uni\u0002formizes a Riemann surface of genus ^ = 70 (Riemann-Hurwitz formula) that we\r
call ^g=70' By its construction and the fact that [2,5,11] is a maximal triangle\r
group, we have proved that\r
Aut(;Zg=7o) = f^i:(2,ii).\r
We know that f = (1; [5, 5,11]) < [2,5,11] and if we take a presentation for f\r
given by:\r
< G, 6, c, z, 1/ I = 1 >\r
we see that % : [2, 5,11] can be defined by:\r
%(a) = %(6) -\r
%(c) = z(a;) = 2(3/) =\r
If we consider now the restriction ^ : (1,[5,5,11]) —f5'i}(2,11 ) defined as\r
^(a;) = $(%(a;)) for any z G (1,[5,5,11]), we see that = Ggg and so we\r
can construct the following stack of groups where horizontal lines denote group\r
epimorphisms and vertical arrows symbolize group inclusions.\r
[2,5,11] fgi;(2,ll )\r
^12 %12\r
(1;[5,5,11]) ^ > Ggg\r
]^55 ]^55\r
jiL'er(^) > {1}\r
To find the structure of the bipartite graph on the surface we need to consider\r
one set of 22 points that will correspond to the vertices of the bipartite graph, and\r
another one of 55 points that correspond to edge centres (bits).\r
We will call the image of the embedding of the group Ggg into the automor\u0002phism group of ^g=7o- k chapter two we have seen that there are twelve diSerent\r
subgroups of order 11 in f 6'Z,(2,11). If we consider them as subgroups of the au\u0002tomorphism group of J?g=7o, we can see that each subgroup C n fixes five points on\r
93

the surface, and no two subgroups Hx the same point, so we have 60 distinguished\r
points on the surface. If we remove from this set the five points fixed by the action\r
of jif (i.e. the five points hxed by C^i), we obtain a collection of 55 points that are\r
transitively permuted by the action of ^ and that corresponds to the bits of the\r
embedded graph.\r
The remaining 22 points arise naturally when we consider the action of the\r
order five subgroups of 77. There are 11 such subgroups, each one Axes two points\r
on the surface, and therefore we have found the 22 points we needed. The choice of\r
colour is arbitrary, we need to hx one of the C5, for example C^'° , and paint one\r
of its fix points white, the other black. If we let acts on this pair of coloured\r
points, we will get the colouring for the remaining.\r
Since there are 12 diSerent embeddings of G55 in f5'i,(2,ll), there are 12\r
ways of embedding the bipartite graph (not considering swapping the colours of the\r
vertices), but all of them are conjugate by an automorphism of the surface.\r
4.8. Embedding the 3-biplane inside j%g=i25\r
This embedding arises when one consider the triangle group [3, 5,11] with pre\u0002sentation:\r
< A, C I = A BC = 1 >\r
and the group epimorphism $ : [3, 5,11] —^ f 5'i,(2,11) dehned by:\r
I ) . $(ij)=( [ ;») . I ) .\r
It is easy to check that $ is an epimorphism with a torsion free kernel, and that\r
7irer($) uniformizes a Riemann surface of genus ^ = 125 that we call 7(g-i25- We\r
can prove that F = (2, [5, 5,11]) with presentation\r
< a;, ?/, z, (, a, 6, c I = 1 >\r
is a subgroup of [3, 5,11] and using Schreier's method And the following equations\r
for the inclusion % : F —[3 , 5,11]:\r
%(«) =\r
2(6) = 2(c) =\r
94

With all the group maps defined as before, we can restrict $ to f in which\r
case we obtain a group epimorphism onto and the following stack of groups:\r
[3,5,11] ^ > fgi:(2,ll )\r
-[12 %12\r
(2; [5, 5,11]) > Ggg\r
%11 %11\r
> {1}\r
So what we get is another conformal embedding of the 3-biplane as a (5,5,11)\r
bipartite graph inside ^^=125-\r
4.9. Other considerations for the 3-biplane and Rg-jo\r
Among all the possibilities displayed above, the embedding of the 3-biplane\r
into ^g=:7o as a bipartite graph seems the most interesting one because we can 6nd\r
a fair amount of relations between it and Singerman's embedding of the Fano plane.\r
Among them we will give a 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of (4 — \\/5) and\r
show a geometric action of f 6'i^(2,11) on eleven objects on the surface Ag=7o\u0002In chapter two we have introduced the Hecke group and we saw that its\r
signature as a Puchsian group is [2,5,00]. Following the ideas explained in Singer\u0002man's embedding, we can easily define an epimorphism ^ ^ [2,5,11] given\r
by (presentations for both groups as used before):\r
^(%) = A ^(y ) = B ^(Z) = C\r
that will allow us to extend the 3-biplane structure from Ag-70 to some cusp set of\r
congruence subgroups of If we pull-back the subgroups of [2,5,11] by means\r
of $ we get the group diagram displayed in next page.\r
In this case the role of the ideal (7) in the description of Klein's surface is\r
played either by (4 + \\/5) or (4 — \\/5), the reason for this is that (11), which would\r
be the natural choice, is not longer a prime ideal in Z[A5] since it can be factorized\r
as the product of the previously mentioned ideals. It is trivial to see that ^ extends\r
easily to an epimorphism onto f 5'i,(2,11) as the following diagram shows.\r

We have seen in Proposition 2.5.6. that the cusp set of j7"(4 — VS) in the\r
upper half-plane can be described in terms of fractions of Q(\\/5) in their canonical\r
form. We will now label the cusps so that we can obtain a picture of the 3-biplane\r
embedding associated to the action of Ggg in the cusp set.\r
96

We win represent a fraction in its canonical form ^ G Q(\\/5) by the coordinates\r
(a, 6) where o, 6 G {0, 1, ... , 10}, if and only if:\r
f mod(4 — \\/5)\r
and\r
Q = ±6 mod(4 — \\/5)\r
Using that notation we get the incidence diagram in where darker\r
pawns represent vertices, lighter pawns represent edges and two points with the\r
same coordinates are identiGed.\r
4.10. Embeddings related to PSL{2,11)\r
In this section we will describe other geometrical structures that can be de\u0002scribed in terms of embeddings into and we will see a geometrical action\r
of f 11) on eleven objects. As we have seen in the previous section, we can\r
consider the embeddings as lying on or Eis displayed in the cusp set of\r
where\r
7 — (4 + \\/5) or 7 = (4 — \\/5).\r
The biggest proper subgroup of f 5'Z,(2,11) has order 60 and as we have seen,\r
it is isomorphic to f5'i,(2,5). We have already mentioned that there are 22 of\r
them into two conjugacy classes. They can be seen as the symmetry group of\r
the icosahedron, in fact, if we take the 60 points Bxed by elements of order 11 on\r
^g=70, we will see that they correspond to the vertices of a truncated icosahedron\r
(a football).\r
Let us consider any of the possible embeddings of ^4^ into f 6'Z}(2,11), there\r
are six subgroups of order 5 inside it, and each Cg Exes two points on the surface of\r
-Rg=7o when we see them as subgroups of its automorphism group. Each pair of fixed\r
points by a Cg can be seen as a diagonal of the (truncated) icosahedron embedded\r
on the surface. Every point in that pan- is the centre of an hyperbolic equilateral\r
pentagon, whose vertices are points fixed by elements of order 11 and in that manner\r
we obtain the 12 pentagonal faces of the truncated icosahedron on the surface\r
^g=70- For the hexagonal faces we can proceed in any of two ways: we can study\r
the action of the subgroups of order 3 on the set of C5, or consider the action of the\r
subgroups of order two on the surface, each subgroup of order two hxes two points\r
on the surface that correspond to edge centres of hexagonal edges of the truncated\r
icosahedron. With some work and a fair amount of calculation it is possible to\r
97

obtain a picture for the truncated icosahedron inside Ag-70, although given the big\r
genus of the surface and the low order of the highest order automorphism of the\r
surface, it shows as much as it conceals and so we will not display it here.\r
There are twenty two embeddings of a truncated icosahedron inside Ag=7o, dis\u0002tributed into two conjugacy classes, although orientation reversing automorphisms\r
of the surface will take one class onto the other. We will hnish this section by\r
showing a model for a geometric action of f 5'Z(2,11) on eleven points that is re\u0002lated to a model for the 3-triplane inside _Rg=7o (The definition of a triplane follows\r
naturally as a generalization of the one for a biplane).\r
The geometric action of f 11) on eleven objects is related to the combi\u0002natorial objects that are stabilized by A5 < f ^2/(2,11) and that can be embedded\r
into Ag=7o, so the truncated icosahedron is the obvious choice for it. If we consider\r
the eleven truncated icosahedra inside a conjugacy class, each one is linked to one\r
embedding of /Is inside a conjugacy class, and so the algebraic action of f 5'i,(2,11)\r
on the A5 of one class is analogous to its geometric action on the embedding of the\r
truncated icosahedron corresponding to that A5.\r
Following the same ideas displayed in the sections regarding the Fano plane,\r
we can consider the diagonals of each embedding of a truncated icosahedron as\r
bits of a combinatorial structure, and we can label them using the labelling for the\r
subgroup isomorphic to C5 in f5'i^(2,ll) whose pull-back into A'u((Eg=7o) &xes\r
that diagonal. If we do so, we can take the icosahedrons in one conjugacy class\r
as "lines" of an incidence structure (CZoss iL in the table in chapter 2) and the\r
icosahedrons in the other conjugacy class as "points" (CZasg f ). If we check the\r
resulting incidence structure, we see that we obtained a model for the 3-triplane,\r
that is, the complement geometry of the 3-biplane inside ^^=70-\r
4.11. Another example of a graph embedding\r
In this section we will describe an embedding of the Fano plane into a surface of\r
genus ^ = 24 that we will call Ag=24. We wiU embed the Fano plane as a conformal\r
graph in the same way as we have done with the 3-biplane. This is the only possible\r
rigid embedding of the Fano plane as a bipartite graph with non simply connected\r
faces into a surface with automorphism group isomorphic to _P5'iy(2,7).\r
We will consider the triangle group [3, 4, 7] with presentation:\r
< A, B, C I = ABC = 1 >\r
98

and the epimorphism $ : [3, 4, 7] —^ PSL{2, 7) given by:\r
= : ! ) «(«) = ( : ; 4) = ( 0 e )'\r
It is easy to check that $ is an epimorphism and that the group is\r
torsion free and therefore it imiformizes a Riemann surface that has genus ^ = 24.\r
We will see now that the Fuchsian group (1; [3,3, 7]) with presentation:\r
< o, 6, c, a;,!/ I = 1 >\r
is an index 8 subgroup of [3,4,7], with the inclusion given by:\r
%(a;) = 2(1/) =\r
2(0) = = 1 %(6) = 2(c) =\r
If we restrict $ to ^ in the usual way ^(z) = $(%(z)) for any z G (1; [3,3,7]) we\r
get the following stack of groups and an embedding of the Fano plane as a bipartite\r
graph inside ^g=24-\r

ABSTRACT\r
FACULTY OF MATHEMATICS\r
Doctor of Philosophy\r
EMBEDDING OF SOME FINITE GEOMETRIES\r
INTO RIEMANN SURFACES\r
by Pablo Martm Garcia\r
In this thesis we provide examples of a new approach to the field of finite geometries,\r
namely by considering the conformal embedding of a hnite geometry into a Riemann\r
surface. A hnite geometry is a particular arrangement of a finite number of points\r
and lines satisfying some well known axioms. We will cover the hrst two examples\r
of the family of Hadamard designs, which are the Fano plane and the 3-biplane.\r
Riemann surfaces and dessins are introduced and explained in chapter one. We\r
explore their common relationship to cocompact Puchsian groups and display some\r
results regarding the calculation of their automorphisms groups. We also describe\r
the three most common geometric representations of a dessin: those by Cori, James\r
and Walsh.\r
Chapter two is divided into two different parts. In the first one we cover the\r
family of finite groups PSL{2,p) where p is a prime number, particularly for the\r
cases where p e {5, 7,11}. In the second part of the chapter we introduce the family\r
of Hecke groups H'^ and their special congruence subgroups, with special regards\r
to the cases where g = 3 and g = 5.\r
In chapter three we cover finite geometries and their properties. Projective\r
planes and biplanes are studied in diSFerent sections paying special attention to the\r
Fano plane as our chosen representative for the projective planes and the 3-biplane.\r
Finally in chapter four we make extensive use of aU the preliminar material\r
by finding and describing several conformal embeddings of the Fano plane and\r
the 3-biplane into Riemann surfaces, especially into those Riemann surfaces with\r
automorphism group isomorphic to and that can be uniformized by a\r
special congruence subgroup of H'^.

A map, or more generally a dessin, is a particular arrangement of faces, vertices\r
and edges that have a very rich and widely explored relationship with Riemann\r
surfaces and Puchsian triangle groups. See for example [JSl], [Sch] and [Wal].\r
The theory that originally covered conformal embeddings of maps into Riemann\r
Surfaces, heis been progressively expanded to embrace an ever increasing class of\r
subjects, such as anticonformal embeddings of hypermaps into Klein surfaces and\r
their relationship with N.E.C. triangle groups (see [BS] or [IS]). In chapter one\r
we introduce Riemann surfaces, Fuchsian groups, dessins and some of their prop\u0002erties and relationships, since they constitute the foundation stone of the examples\r
displayed in chapter four.\r
It was first observed by Walsh [Wal] in 1975 that it is possible to embed the\r
incidence relation of the Fano plane as a map into a torus. In 1986 [Si4] Singerman\r
described another embedding of the Fano plane as a regular dessin into a Riemann\r
surface. A regular dessin is one possesing the highest possible symmetry in a surface,\r
and Singerman's embedding proved particularly interesting, since it linked together\r
three well known and widely studied objects: the Fano plane, Klein's quartic and\r
their automorphism groups which are isomorphic to PSL{2,7). Furthermore it\r
is possible to describe the bits of that embedding by means of the cusp set of\r
the action of r(7) on the upper half plane, where r(7) stands for the principal\r
congruence subgroup of level seven of the modular group.\r
All objects highlighted in Singerman's embedding are exceptional on their own\r
rights. Klein's quartic, among other interesting properties, is the Hurwitz surface\r
with the smallest genus (a Hurwitz surface is one that attains Hurwitz's upper\r
iii

bound for the number of automorphisms of a surface, which is 84(p — 1) for ^ > 2)\r
and therefore it is a highly symmetric surface. The Fano plane is the smallest\r
hnite projective plane, and arises as the projective space over the held Z2, while\r
f5'Z,(2,7) enjoys a special status within the f5'Z,(2,p) family that is only shared\r
by f 5'Z,(2,5) and f 5'i,(2,11) as it was proven in a result due to Evariste Galois.\r
What we have done is to fully explore what we considered to be the parallel case\r
to the Fano plane embedding described by D. Singerman, Ending some intriguing\r
and beautiful relationships on our way. Since Singerman's embedding fully covers\r
f6'Z,(2,7), we have been guided by the idea of exploring the remaining case in\r
Galois' result, which is f5'i,(2,11), Ending objects that relate to each other in a\r
similar way to those involved with f6'jL(2,7). As a starting point for our work,\r
I have to acknowledge a very inspirational paper by Konstant: T/ie prap/i 0/ (Ae\r
truncated /cogo/iedroM amcf (Ae 0/ GaZow' (see [Ko]).\r
Starting then with f5'i,(2,ll) we chose the 3-biplane aa the best candidate\r
for a structure to embed for several reasons. The hrst one is because it is a hnite\r
geometry with automorphism group isomorphic to PSL{2,11), which is a necessary\r
condition and that is fairly similar to the Fano plane. Both of them, the Fano\r
plane and the 3-biplane are the smallest examples of Hadamard designs, and the\r
symmetric arrangement of the 55 Sags structure of the 3-biplane into 11 blocks of"""

other hand, there is a clear relationship between the flags set of the 3-biplane and\r
the vertices of a truncated icosahedron (which is basically the relationship between\r
f 5'i^(2,11) and its subgroups isomorphic to /Ig = f ^i,(2, 5)), and that relationship\r
mirrors that of the Fano plane and the truncated cube (which is again that between\r
f5'i^(2,7) and its ^'4 subgroups).\r
In spite of Snding examples of 3-biplane conformal embeddings as a regular\r
iv

dessin, we thought it more appropriate to drop some hypothesis in the embedding in\r
order to And examples with the rich structure underlying Singerman's embedding.\r
Our main example is therefore no longer a dessin, since the components of the\r
complement of the embedded graph in the surface are not simply connected. This\r
is highlighted by the fact that we do not use a triangle group, but a Puchsian group\r
with three periods and signature (1, +, [5,5,11]).\r

to play a role similar to that of in the Fano plane case, further enhancing\r
the singular nature of these two embeddings, since and stand in a class\r
of their own within as the only two Hecke groups with a cusp set equal to\r

Chapte r One\r
Riemann Surfaces and Dessins\r
In the first half of this chapter we introduce the concept of Riemann surface\r
and provide some preliminary dehnitions and results. For a broader introduction\r
to Riemann surfaces see either [Mir] or [JS2]. The notion of compact Riemann\r
surface will be explored following two diS'erent but closely related approaches:\r
- as 2-manifolds with an analytic structure,\r
- as the quotient by the action of a cocompact Fuchsian group.\r
Issues related to Fuchsian and NEC groups have also been discussed within\r
the first part of the chapter.\r
In the second half we have examined the general properties of dessins and their\r
conformal embeddings into Riemann surfaces.\r
A more general approach to the subject by substituting Riemann surfaces with\r
Klein surfaces has been outlined, and references to the topic of dessins embedding\r
in Klein surfaces are provided."""

Roughly, a is a space which, locally, looks like an open set in\r
the complex plane. To make the concept of "looks like" a bit more mathematical,\r
we need to define a c/iorf on a topological space %.\r
A c/iaff on a two dimensional topological space % is a homeomorphism\r
—> v;\r
where (7^ C % is an open set in %, and C C is an open set in the complex plane.\r
The open subset ZTi is called the of the chart We say that the chart

is cenfrecf at p E (Ti if = 0, and it is easy to see that all a chart does is to give\r
local complex coordinates in its domain.\r
As the charts are local homeomorphisms, they can be inverted, and we will call\r

in the set are compatible. We will call the charts in an analytic atlas\r
c/iorfs (or compZei\r
It is easy to de6ne an equivalence relation within the atlases of X, two atlases\r
vl and jB are if every chart of one is compatible with every chart of the\r
other, and an equivalence class of analytic atlases is called a comp/ea; a(ruc(wre (or\r

Definition 1.1.1. A second countable, connected, Hausdorff topological space\r
with a complex structure is called a\r
Although the previous dehnition allows non-compact surfaces, throughout this\r
work we will usually mean a "compact Riemann surface" every time we refer to a\r
Riemann surface.\r
We can induce local orientations around each point of a Riemann surface by\r
"pull-back" of the orientation of the complex plane via a local chart. These local\r
orientations are well defined, independent of the choice of chart in the atlas and\r
they induce a global orientation on the Riemann surface so that the concept of\r
"clockwise" and "anticlockwise" rotation around a point in a Riemann surface is\r
well defined.\r
Given two Riemann surfaces % and Y with complex atlases $ and we can\r
define analytic mappings between % and Y in terms of their charts.\r
Definition 1.1.2, Let X and Y be Riemann surfaces with complex atlases\r
$ = ^ and ^ V}} respectively. We say that the map\r
/ : % —> y is at p E % if there exist analytic charts % with\r
p E and ^ with /(p) E [/j such that 1/;^ o / o is an analytic\r
function at (p).

A map will be analytic in X if and only if it is analytic at every point of X. By\r
deGnition, if a map is analytic at p, it is analytic in a neighbourhood of p. Using\r
similar principles, we can define meromorphic and analytic functions on Riemann\r
surfaces.\r
It is easy to see that the complex plane C admits a complex structure and so\r
is a Riemann surface (although not a compact one). By means of the stereographic\r
projection, the one point compactiScation of C, E = CU{oo} also forms a Riemann\r
surface which is called the Azemann 5^/iere. Analytic and meromorphic functions\r
on a Riemann surface % (in the traditional sense of complex analysis) can be\r
thought of as being analytic mappings from % to C and 2 respectively in the sense\r
of Riemann surfaces.\r
If a Riemann surface locally looks like an open set in the complex plane, there is\r
a more general object, that we will cover for the sake of completeness called a jiT/em\r
auT/oce, for a thorough introduction to Klein surfaces see [AG]. A Klein surface\r
has the property of being locally like an open set in the closed upper half-plane,\r
= {a + 6* : a, 6 E R and 6 > 0}.\r
with the subspace topology that inherits from the usual topology on C.\r
Since there are two different classes of open sets in the upper half plane: those\r
that intersect its boundary, and those that are contained in the interior of the upper\r
half plane, we need to dehne transition functions that cope with this characteristic.\r
We will say that a complex function / is antianalytic (or anticonformat) if\r
d j jdz ~ 0, and / will be called dianalytic if it is either analytic or antianalytic in\r
each connected component of its domain. It is easy to see that a function that is\r
both analytic and antianalytic in the same coimected component of the domain, is\r
constant on that component. We can generalize the concept of analytic chart to\r
that of on a homeomorphism where Ui is an open\r
subset of % and is an open subset of either C or . If is centred at p 6 % and\r
Vi is an open set of but not of C, we will say that p is in the of % (we\r
use to refer to the boundary of %). Two charts will be compofzbJe\r
if their transition functions are dianalytic, and a set of charts : [7^ —> on X\r
is called a on X if is an open cover of % and all the transition\r
functions are dianalytic.

Two dianalytic atlases A and B will be dianalytically equivalent if A U B is\r
a dianalytic atlas (that is, if every chart of one is dianalytically compatible with\r
every chart of the other), and an equivalence class of dianalytic atlases on vY is a\r
on\r
Definition 1.1.3. A 2-manifold X with a dianalytic structure A on X will be\r
called a sur/ace.\r
According to the previous definition, any Riemann surface is in fact a Klein\r
surface, since any analytic atlaa is dianalytic, and any open set of C is homeomorphic\r
to an open set in (C+. To avoid confusion, we will reserve the term "Klein surface"\r
to its traditional meaning, that is, any surface % with a dianalytic structure that is\r
not orientable or has at least one boundary component, and we will use "Riemann\r
surface" to refer to Klein surfaces that are orientable and have no boundary. In\r
general, Klein surfaces will be assumed to be compact. As we have already stated\r
we will mainly study symmetric Riemann surfaces throughout this work.\r
Let / : X ^ y be an analytic map defined at p which is not constant, then\r
(see [Mir]) there is a unique integer m > 1 such that there are local analytic charts\r
and centred at p and /(p) respectively, such that o / o We\r
will call m the of / at p. The multiplicity of a map at one point is\r
independent of the choice of charts, and by taking an element 1/ G Y we can dehne\r
the decree of / at 1/ ag the sum of the multiplicities of / at the points of % mapping\r
to ?/:\r
4(/ ) = ^\r
The degree of / at 1/ is constant, independent of 1/, and so we will just call it\r
the degree of / .\r
Given an analytic function / : % — Y of degree n, there is a hnite set of points\r
C(/) C y so that |/"^(3/)| = M for any ?/ E y — C(/) and 1 < |/^^(i/)| < M for every\r
?/ E C(/), / is then an 6rancAe(f if C(/) ^ 0 and\r
otherwise. The elements of C(/) are called the nafttea or of / ,\r
the elements a; 6 % with multiplicity greater than one are called the\r
or of / , and those with multiplicity one are called\r
Both, the set of critical values and of critical points are finite.

The above theorem is due to F. Klein, H. Poincare and P. Koebe, for a proof\r

in terms of the trace of the matrices.\r
We will say that an element M = ^ f6'Z,(2,R) is\r

We have that tr(M) — |a + < 2.\r
- if the action of M fixes only one point onEu{oo} , |a + d| = 2.\r
- if M 6xes two points in R U {00}, we get that |a + (f| > 2.\r
It is worth thinking of elliptic elements as Enite order rotations about a point\r
in the open upper-half plane, while parabolic elements can be seen as inhnite order\r
rotations about a point in R U {00} and hyperbolic elements as translations in the\r
closed upper-half plane.\r
Any hxed point by a parabolic element of a Puchsian group G is called a cusp\r
(or pom(), and the set of all cusps by elements of G is called the cusp set\r
of G. The number of orbits of the action of G in its cusp set is called the\r
c/oss TZMmter of G.\r
A point a 6 R U {00} is a of a Fuchsian group F if there is a a; E ZY\r
and a sequence ^ = ^1, ^2, - -, - - with 6 F such that the sequence\r
^(a;) = ^yi(a;), ^2(2;),..., . . .\r
converges to a. The set of all hmits points of F is Z'(F), the set of F. Every\r
point a fixed by a parabolic or hyperbolic element of F is a limit point of F. If we\r
call 0(F) = R — L(r) the ordinary set of F, we will say that the Fuchsian group F\r
is of the Amcf if 0(F) is empty, otherwise we will say that F is of the secoMcf\r
If F is of the second kind, then I,(F) is nowhere dense in R. We will only deal\r
with first kind Fuchsian groups.\r
By the uniformisation theorem, we know that for each Riemann surface\r
there is a set of torsion free crystallographic groups = {0^} that uniformize\r
these groups are called stfyyace of and it can be proved that is a\r
class of conjugate groups in At((+(P) so that A is isomorphic to if and only if

A is a special type of fundamental region whose boundary\r
is a union of geodesic segments that we call the of the polygon. Given any\r
fundamental polygon f and g a side of f then there is precisely one side of f that\r
we call g and one element p E G so that ^(g) — s (it is possible that g = g) and\r
p(f ) is adjacent to f along g. We say that g and g are pozred by\r
Fundamental polygons are very useful to And presentations for subgroups of\r
Puchsian groups by means of a technique known aa Reidemeister-Schreier's method.\r
It can be proved [Bea] that given f a fundamental polygon for the Puchsian group\r
r, the side pairings elements of f generate F, so we can associate to the fundamental\r
polygon f a set of generators for F\r
$ = {A, ,^2, . . . ,/3n}\r

Ar = Ap and we call g = r. Then the set\r

The following result shows how to construct a fundamental polygon for A < F.\r

As we have mentioned before, the group of automorphisms of P contains orien\u0002tation reversing elements as well, so we may consider what happens when we allow\r
orientation reversing elements in the previous theory. Although there is no generic\r
name for a discrete subgroup of A'u(('P) with orientation reversing elements, we will\r
be mainly concerned with crystallographic groups, and in this case we use\r
as an acronym for Non Euclidean Crystallographic, referring to cocompact discrete\r
subgroups of\r

just NEC group) for those which do. If G is an NEC group, its coTioMzcaZ\r
is G"*". Since the set of Riemann surfaces arising from the action of\r
Euclidean and spherical groups is very limited in scope (for instance, no surface of\r
genus g > 2 is formed in such a way), we may sometimes use the word "Fuchsian"\r
in a general way to refer to a group that contains no orientation reversing elements,\r

Intuitively, a map is a decomposition of a surface into polygonal two-cells\r
or faces. That leaves a structure on the surface composed by the interior of the\r
polygons (faces), edges and vertices that constitute the map, for an easy example\r
of these we can think of the platonic solids as maps on the surface of the sphere,\r
picture below depicts the map on the sphere induced by a tetrahedron.\r
The set of vertices and edges of the map constitute a graph which is embedded\r
into the surface. Although we will allow a very general class of graph, we will\r
require the graph to be connected and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges, this number is the of the vertex. Our graph can\r
contain edges with one or two vertices, the edges with two vertices correspond to\r
our everyday perception of an edge, as for the edges with only one vertex, they can\r
either be a Zoop or a /ree ecfpe, the difference being that a loop is homeomorphic\r
to a circle, while a free edge is homeomorphic to a segment. Every face would\r
be surrounded by a finite number of edges, and this number is the valency of the\r
14

face, faces should be simply-connected. An oZZoiuecf is a graph satisfying the\r
previous conditions. For a picture of a generic map on a sphere see Fip. 6^\r

A Aypergrop/i is a generalization of this idea where we allow any Enite number\r
of vertices to lie on an edge. We will meet some hypergraphs when we describe\r
Enite geometries in chapter three. Our only restriction on the structure of the\r
hypergraph is that it is connected, and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges. We can dehne a Momorp/iigm as a bijection\r
/ between the vertex sets of two (hyper) graphs that induces a bijection between\r
the edges set so that the incidence structure is preserved, that is, if\r
I(P) e f{E)\r
where P is any vertex contained in the edge E.\r
We will start with the topological approach to a map, then describe the al\u0002gebraic structure of it, and use algebraic notions to generalize the concept of map\r
to that of a hypermap. Nevertheless, after the topological and the algebraic ap\u0002proaches have been explained, we will need to provide maps with a richer structure,\r
namely the analytic structure of their underlying Riemann surface.\r

Given the triangle group T[m, 2,n] with a presentation of the form:\r
r[m, 2, n] =< a, b | a™' = b"^ = = 1 >\r
and a map Ai of type (m, n) with AZp"^(Ai) = r2+,ro,ri), we can de6ne an\r
epimorphism 6 : T[m, 2, n] —sendin g a to tq and 6 to ri.\r
Let G+a — {p G G+lap = a } be the stabiliser of a E then M =\r
is called a fundamental group of M in T[m, 2,n]. A different choice of dart a will\r
yield a group conjugated to M in r[m, 2, n], hence to every map Af of type (m, n),\r
we can associate a conjugacy class of fundamental groups in r[m, 2, n] (see [JSl]).\r
Next, we identify (1+ with the set of right M-cosets in r[m, 2, n] by the bijection\r
MA —a!(/i^). Taking M* = jiL'er(^), the core of M (the intersection of all the\r
conjugates of M by elements of F), we can identify G+ with the quotient group\r
17

r[m, 2, M]/M* by M*p ^ so that the action of a (respectively 6) corresponds to\r
the permutation ro (respec. ri) in (7+. In this way we see that any finite index\r
subgroup M < [m, 2,i s a fundamental group of some oriented map.\r
It is possible to generalize the concept of dart, so that we can define maps\r
on Klein surfaces, this generalization relates in a natural way to the inclusion of\r
crystallographic triangle groups into NEC triangle groups, see [BS].\r
Another important property of a fundamental group M of a map Ai is that\r
the surface 5" in which the map is embedded is uniformized (not uniquely) by M in\r
the sense that:\r
^=M\u0002To every topological map corresponds an algebraic map, and from any algebraic\r
map we can recover a topological map. Unfortunately, this relationship does not\r
make both categories equivalent, since there are many ways of altering a topological\r
map via an homeomorphism of the underlying surface without a counterpart in the\r
side of algebraic maps. We want to have a geometrical definition of map that\r
allows us to translate results from the algebraic category to the geometrical one,\r
and in order to do so, we need to define maps on surfaces in such a way that the\r
isomorphisms between them correspond to isomorphisms between their underlying\r
surfaces. These maps when considered on Riemann surfaces were originally called\r
mopg by [JS], we will call them maps, since their isomorphisms\r
correspond to mappings that preserve the analytic structure of their underlying\r
surfaces. The first step to define them is to define universal maps and quotients of\r
maps.\r
The NEC triangle group r(2, m,») acts naturally on 7^ and has a triangle T\r
of angles a = §, 6 = ^ and c = ^ as its fundamental polygon. If we draw a dart\r
on the side (z6, and let F act on ab with that dart, we get a map on 7^ with all the\r
edges of the same length and such that all vertices have order m and aU faces have\r
order m, this is the map o/ (ype\r
Let Ai = (^,V,5') be a topological map of type (m,n), then there is an\r
algebraic map ^ = yl/p(Ai) associated with it, from where we can calculate a\r
fundamental group M of M.. We have seen that M < (2,m, n) and therefore M\r
acts on the universal map Ai of type (m, n) sending vertices to vertices, edges\r
18

to edges and face centres to face centres. The quotient of this action is a map\r
vM of type (m, zi) which is naturally embedded in the surface 5" by the covering\r
TT : P and which is topologically equivalent to Ai. Ai is an map of\r
VW.\r
Any analytic map, is in particular a topological map. We have proved that to\r
any algebraic map there is at least one topological map Ai so that .A =\r
Definition 1.3.7. Two maps M and M ' of type (m, n) embedded in the sur\u0002faces 6" and 5" are called if there is an analytic isomorphism\r
between the surfaces that takes the set of vertices, edges and faces of Ai to the set\r
of vertices, edges and faces of Ai' respectively.\r
If we consider the dehnition of an algebraic map, there is no reason why we\r
should restrict ourselves to quadruples where ri has order two, and not consider\r
groups where this condition is dropped. In fact, this property corresponds to the\r
fact that the edges have only two vertices, so by allowing a higher order in ri, we will\r
study maps whose edges contain more than two vertices, and whose fundamental\r
group is a Snite index subgroup of the triangle group Those objects are\r
what we call Ayjcermopa."""

T h e Cori representatio n\r
In the Cori representation (see [Co]) hypervertices and hyperedges are rep\u0002resented by closed polygons called 0-faces and 1-faces respectively (we will colour\r
0-faces with a light grey and 1-faces with a dark grey), each polygon having as many\r
sides as the length of the cycle it represents, while hyperfaces are represented by\r
open polygons called 2-faces each one having twice as many sides as the order of the\r
hyperface they represent (2-faces are painted white). 0-faces are mutually disjoint,\r
as are 1-faces, and they intersect each other only in their vertices, which represent\r
the bits, each bit shared by precisely one hypervertex and one hyperedge. As the\r
hypermap is embedded in an orientable surface A, we can de&ne an anticlockwise\r
permutation of the bits around each 0-face and each 1-face consistent with the ori\u0002entation of these permutations corresponds to ro and respectively. If we call\r
y the set of aU O-faces, and ^ the set of aU 1-faces, then y U ^ is a closed set in\r
i?, and the components of R — {V U E) are the 2-faces, which are open polygons\r
20

that induce the permutation rg = (ror^^). As 2-faces have an even number of bits,\r
^2 permute the bits acting as the square of the clockwise permutation around each\r
hyperface.\r
The Cori representation is very easy to draw and shows some symmetries of\r
the hypermap in a clear way, but has the drawback of differentiating between hy\u0002pervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces in a way that seems unnatural if we regard\r
the algebraic definition of the hypermap.\r
T h e Jame s representatio n\r
The James representation (see [Ja]) displays the trinity among hypervertices,\r
hyperedges and hyperfaces in a more natural way. This time O-faces, l-faces and\r
2-faces will aU be polygons with twice as many sides as the orders of the elements\r
they represent. The intersection of any two i-faces is always empty, and O-faces\r
and l-faces intersect along one side. To place the bits, we need to consider the\r
three-valent map on ^ dehned by the sides of these polygons, in such a map every\r
vertex heis order three and each edge separates faces of diSFerent labels (there are\r
no two i-faces with a common edge). Going anticlockwise around each vertex, we\r
get a permutation of the faces that is either (0,1,2) or (0,2,1), if the permutation\r
is (0,1,2), the vertex is called a bit. Once the bits are placed, the permutations\r
ro, ri and rg follow in the same way as with the Cori representation.\r
Cori James\r
Con: Jamea Aypermap %e.\r
To go from the Cori representation to the James representation, we push to\u0002gether the hypervertices and hyperedges with a common bit, thereby changing the\r
bit in the Cori representation (one point) to an edge in the James representation\r
one of whose vertices is a bit, and doubling the number of sides of every 0-face and\r

therefore substituting each bit shared by the 0-face and 1-face for an edge joining\r

following result:\r
Theorem 2.A.8. For p > 11, there is no subgroup of PSL{2,p) which is\r
complementary to any of its p-subgroups.\r
That means that for p > 11 we cannot get jP5'Z^(2,p) = Zp, which im\u0002plies that there is no transitive action on p points for PSL{2,p) if p > 11. This\r
can be seen in the following way: as p is a factor of \\PSL(2,p)\\ and p^ is not\r
(see Proposition 2.A.I.), if there is a transitive action of PSL{2,p) on p points\r
{a;i,... ,a;p}, no order p element of f5'i^(2,p) can fix any {a;^} (otherwise p^ will\r
divide |f5'i^(2,p)|), which means that given g E f5'Z,(2,p) of order p, we have that\r
f ^Z,(2,p) = 5'(a6(a;i) < p > for any z E {1,... ,p}.\r
For the cases where p < 11 and f 5'i,(2,p) simple, that is, for p = 5, 7,11, we\r
know that the following holds:\r
f;9i:(2,5) = A4-C5 f^i,(2,7 ) = &.C 7 fgI,(2,ll) = A5.Ci i\r

pairs of edges so that each pair defines a rectangle inscribed in the icosahedron.\r

In general, a Hecke group is a discrete subgroup of f5'Z,(2,R) that is\r
generated by the following two transformations:\r

In a result due to Hecke [He], any group generated by % and Z as before is\r
discrete if and only if A > 2 or A = = 2 cos where M E N and M > 3. The\r
Hecke groups where A > 2, are Fuchsian groups of the second kind, with a limit set\r
that is nowhere dense in R, and they are of no interest to us. The case A = 2 gives\r
a Puchsian group of the hrst kind but with a non compact quotient, as for the case\r
A = An they are Fuchsian groups of the 6rst kind, and we will refer to them as\r

As for the set of cusps, it is not known what the cusp set is for a general\r
although we know that the cusp set of f 5'_L(2, Z[An]) is Q(An) U {00} (which we\r
represent by Q(An)) and thus that of jif" must be a subset of Q(An). One of the\r
42

best results for this problem is due to Leutbecher [Leu2] who proved that for the\r
values M 6 {3,4,5,6,8,10,12} the cusp set of is:\r
U {oo}.\r
Therefore in the case n = 3, the cusp set is Q while for the case n = 5 its\r
cusp set is Q(\\/5), and in both ceises the cusp set is the whole held completed\r
with infinity. It turns out that these are the only two cases where the equahty\r
— Q(An) holds, since Wolfart [Wol] proved that it is false for any other\r
case except perhaps M = 9 and Seybold proved later that n = 9 is not possible either\r
[Ro].\r
The field Q(An) is a number held, that is, it is a hnite extension of Q, and\r
its degree is where is the Euler function. In fact it is the maximum real\r
subheld of the number held Q(e2n), where is the nth root of unity, and we can\r
easily calculate its degree since : Q(An)] = 2. The ring of algebraic integers\r
of the held Q(An) is Z[An] (see [Was]), that means that if a; 6 Q(An) is a solution\r

where 6; G Z.\r
If we are to study the structure of the ideals of Z[An], it suffices to study\r
its prime ideals, since Z[Xn] is the integral ring of a number field, it is a Unique\r
Factorization Domain (UFD). We cam go even further, since for < 68 every Z[An]\r
is a PID (see [Was]) and every ideal in it is principal. Since we wiH only deal with\r
M = 3 and n = 5 that result covers our two chosen cases.\r
Given f a prime ideal of Z[An] (where n < 68) we will say that jVorm(f) = m\r
if m G Z is the smallest positive rational integer so that P | m. There is a general\r
definition of the of an ideal where the class number is diferent from 1, but\r
we will not need it here.\r
Our last concern is going to be the group of units of the rings Z[An], but in this\r
case we will only cover the cases we are going to use. For n = 3,5 the integers rings\r

are Z and Z\r

respectively, while the group of units in the rings is {1, —1}\r
for the case n = 3, and is the cyclic group generated by for the case n = 5.\r
A standard feature of any Hecke group is that its cusp set can be represented\r
by finite continued fractions.\r
Notation We will use the notation to indicate a term inside a contin\u0002ued fractions expansion, and we will display the terms in a continued fractions\r

An or simply a is a pair of non-empty sets 7^\r

Is c V x jC consisting of a non-empty set of pairs (P, I) where P is a point and I a\r
line. We will assume that the structures have a finite number of points and lines,\r
that is, that they are structures.\r
If (P, Z) E ig, we say that P belongs to Z, that P and / are or that\r
(P, I) is an incidence pair. The usual name for lines in structures is blocks, but we\r
prefer lines since we will rapidly move into geometries.\r
We can represent the incidence relation Is of a finite structure S with m points\r

With the previous definition of structure there are some pathological cases that\r
we want to avoid:\r
- Two lines (resp. points) are if they are incident with the same set of\r
points (resp. lines), if we remove all repetitions (i.e. we get rid of aU repeated\r
elements of one kind but one), we say that we have recfucecf the structure. It is\r
clear that reducing the structure is equivalent to eliminating all repeated rows\r
and columns in the incidence matrix.\r
- We say that an element (point or line) is when it is in none or just\r
one pair of the incidence relation, and we say it is full when it is incident with\r
all the elements of the other type. We a structure if we remove\r
all isolated and full elements. On the other hand, we standardize an incidence\r
matrix when we remove all columns or rows that have either all coeScients\r

A structure is if it is reduced and standardized, we wiU caU\r
a connected totally reduced structure. This dehnition of geometry is\r
56

more restrictive than the usual one (that allows full and repeated elements) but we\r
are not interested in the anomalous cases. Although in the process of reducing or\r
standarizing a given structure <$ we might convert normal elements into repeated,\r
isolated or full elements and therefore will have to remove these elements as well,\r
the process is essentially well defined. Since the structures we Eire considering are\r
hnite, their total reduction is either the empty set or a geometry that we will call\r
Qs\u0002In a reduced structure we can consider any line / as a subset of "P, so that f\r
is incident with Z if f E Z. We will say that a structure is if all the lines\r
contain the same number of points and if all the points are incident with\r
the same number of lines, we will say that a uniform structure with A; points in\r
every line is (nmaZ if every set of A; points is incident with at least one line. A\r
is one with a hnite number of points.\r
We dehne the /Zogs (also called 6/(5 because they play a similar role to that of\r
bits in dessins) of a hnite geometry as an incidence pair, so that every pair ( f, Z) in\r
the incidence relation corresponds to a Aag.\r
Given two structures .9 and 7", an between them is a bijective map\r
from the point set of (S to the point set of 7" that induces a bijective map between\r
the line sets so that the incidence relations are preserved. An is an\r
isomorphism of a structure into itself. These dehnitions extend in a straightforward\r
way to finite geometries.\r
Since an incidence matrix contains all relevant information about a structure,\r
we can characterize isomorphic structures in terma of then: incidence matrices: two\r
structures S and T are isomorphic if and only if there are incidence matrices Ms\r
of and M-r of 7", and two permutation matrices 5" such that:\r
= M-y-.\r
From the definition of geometry and the dual nature of repeated, full and\r
isolated elements, it is clear that points and lines play an interchangeable role, and\r
if we swap points for lines in a geometry ^ we get its geometry, The use of\r
the superscript ^ describe the fact that the incidence matrix of is the transpose\r

There is a limited amount of information regarding the existence of designs for a\r
given set of parameters ((, A;, A) or about the number of non equivalent desings for\r
one choice of parameters. The main result about non existence of square 2 — (t;, A;, A)\r
designs is (for a proof see [HP]):\r
Theorem 3.1.10. (Bruck-Ryser-Chowla ) If v, A:, A € Z satisfy\r
— 1)A = A;(A: — 1)\r
then for the existence of a symmetric (f, A;, A) design it is necessary that:\r
- If f is even then A: — A is a square.\r
If f is odd, then = (A; — A)^;^ + (—ha s a non-trivial solution in\r
integers a;, ^ and z.\r
The following corollary is very important when dealing with projective planes,\r
since it restricts the possible orders for them.\r
Corollary 3.1.11. If a symmetric design with A = 1 and order n exists, and\r
M = 1 (mod 4) or\r
n = 2 (mod 4)\r
then n can be expressed as a sum + 6^ where o, 6 E Z.\r
Proo f Since the design is symmetric and A = 1, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have\r
that\r
V = k{k — 1) + 1 = (n + l)n + 1.\r
Assume now n = 1 (mod 4) or n = 2 (mod 4), we then have = 3 (mod 4) and\r
therefore (—1) ^ = — 1 so that from the second statement in the previous theorem,\r
we have and then\r

rationals if and only if it is the sum of two square integers. O\r
We can obtain similar results about the existence of %-designs of a given order\r
by using Hadamard matrices. A Hadamard matrix of order n is a square n by\r
n matrix H whose entries are either +1 or —1 and such that HH^ = nl. We\r
63

can define a generalized version of the permutation matrix that we have used when\r
dealing with incidence matrices, a is a square matrix\r
whose entries are ±1 or 0 and such that in each row and column all entries but one\r
are zero.\r
Theorem 3.1.12. If iJ is a Hadamard matrix of order n and i?, S are gener\u0002alized permutation matrices of order n, then H' = RHS is a Hadamard matrix of\r

It is clear that a class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order n is stable\r

a matrix in the class such that all entries in the first row and column are 1 (which\r
is obviously not unique for a given class). We will call such a matrix a\r

Theorem 3.1.14. Let H he & normalized Hadamard matrix of order n > 4. If\r

The biplane we are most interested in is the biplane of order 3, which has\r
11 points and 11 lines, and Eve points in each line making a total of 55 bits. Its\r
full group of automorphisms has order 660 and is isomorphic to f5'i^(2,11). Since\r
it is the only biplane of order three, we will refer to it as the 3-biplane. It is a\r
2 - (11,5,2) design.\r
The 3-biplane is related to the quadratic residue classes of Z n in precisely\r
the same way as the Fano plane with Zy. That is, if we take the set of quadratic\r
residues mod 11, A = {1,3,4,5,9} and construct eleven sets of five elements by\r
70

considering the action oi 4> •. z i—> z + 1 (mod 11), we can regard the elements\r
n G Zii as points of the 3-biplane where the lines are represented by where\r
r e Zii.\r
To calculate automorphism groups of biplanes we need to introduce Hussain\r
graphs [Hus]. We will see their importance when dealing with the automorphism\r
group of the 3-biplane. A is a graph associated to any line Z in a\r
biplane B and any point Q 0 Z. The vertices of the graph are those of the line Z,\r
and two vertices f , f G Z are joined by an edge of the Hussain graph if and only if\r
there is a line of the biplane through P, P' and Q.\r

We will use the notation Z-Hussain set (or simply Z-H) to refer to the set of\r
Hussain graphs associated with the line I and [Q, /]-Hussain graph (or [Q, Z]-H) to\r
71

refer to a particular graph in the /-Hussain set. The importance of Hussain graphs\r
is that a line Z E B and the whole set of Z-Hussain graphs completely determine the\r
biplane B, for a proof see Theorem 3.34 in [HP].\r
We will say that the Hnssain graphs [Q,Z]-H and [Q%Z']-H are isomorphic, if\r
they are isomorphic as graphs. Two Z-Hussain sets Z-H and Z'-H are isomorphic if\r
there is a bijection from the point set of Z-H to the point set of Z'-H that induces\r
isomorphisms between their graphs.\r
Propositio n 3.3.1. Given a biplane B and a line I G B any two /-Hussain\r
graphs share exactly two edges and these two edges do not share a vertex. Further\u0002more, every Hussain graph is a divalent graph.\r
Proo f Let us choose two points Q', Q ^ L since 5 is a biplane, there are two\r
lines through Q and Q' that we will call Zi and Z2. Four new points appear when\r
we consider the intersections Zi n Z = {^1,^2}, Z2 H Z = where ^ if\r
% ^ J, since otherwise Zi and Z2 will have more than two points in common.\r
It is immediate to see now that fif z and ^3^4 are two shared edges by [Q, Z]-H\r
and Z]-H and that they do not share a vertex. If there were a third common\r
edge, that will mean that there is a third line through Q and Q' different from Zi\r
and Z2, in contradiction to the fact that B is a biplane.\r
Given f any vertex in [Q,Z]-H, there are only two hnes going through f and\r
Q and each one deSnes an edge of f , therefore any vertex has only two edges and\r
the graph is divalent.\r
Corollary 3.3.2. A [Q, Z]-Hussain graph is a disjoint union of polygons whose\r
vertices are the points of Z.\r
Proo f Immediate since the graph is divalent.\r
Theorem 3.3.3. Two biplanes B and B' are isomorphic if and only if for any\r
line Z E B there is a line Z' E such that the Z-Hussain set is isomorphic to the\r
/'-Hussain set.\r
Proo f Take / G 5 to be a line, and (j) : V —>- V the bijection between the\r
point sets induced by the isomorphism.\r
We will call Z' = (^(Z) and assume Q a point of B and Q 0 Z. Let us call\r
Q' = a]:id choose E Z so that the edge ^1^2 is in [Q,Z]-H. That means\r
that there is a third line h in B so that {Pi,P2,Q) E Zi, which in turns mean\r
72

that are points of the set that is a hne in B', since is\r
an isomorphism. Therefore the edge is in and the graphs are\r
isomorphic.\r
Let us assume now that there are two sets Z-H and I'-Yi that are isomorphic\r
and that ^ : Z-H —> Z'-H is the bijection between the point sets of Z and Z' that\r
defines the isomorphism, so we have aheady dehned the images of any point in Z.\r
Take Q 0 Z a point of B, ^ takes [Q, Z]-H to a graph in Z'-H that we call [Q', Z']-H,\r
so that we can define ^(Q) = Q' and therefore we have extended the definition of ^\r
to a bijection of the whole point set of B. All we need to prove is that it preserves\r
the incidence structure.\r
That takes lines to lines is clear, since given a line Zi in B diSerent from Z,\r
we know that Zi n Z = {^1,^2} and taking Q E Zi and Q 0 Z, as [Q,Z]-H goes to\r
[Q%Z']-H, there must be a line Z^ through and diSerent from Z', and\r
so we call i/'(Zi) = Z^. We have then a bijection of the point set that preserves the\r
lines and the incidence relation.\r
Corollary 3.3.4. Given B and B' two biplanes, and lines I G B and V G i?',\r
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphisms : jB —\r
such that (^(Z) = Z' and the set of isomorphisms of Hussain sets taking Z-H to Z'-H.\r

Proo f Let us call Bi, B2 and B3 the biplanes of order 1, 2 and 3. As\r
has only four points, < 5'4. If we consider its model as a tetrahedron,\r
73

we see that the orientation preserving and orientation reversing symmetries of the\r
tetrahedron are an automorphism of Bi, therefore = ^'4.\r
For B2 we use the fact that B2 is the complement of the Fano plane, and\r
Proposition 3.1.4. In that way Aut{B2) = Aut{Fano) = PSL{2,7). We could as\r
well have calculated ^1/^(^2) using its set of Z-H graphs, if we had done so we would\r
have seen that ther is only one way of drawing an Z-H set (see for a 2\r
biplane, and therefore by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one biplane of order 2.\r
Finally for ^ 3 we need to consider its /-Hussain graphs. A divalent graph on\r
five points must be a pentagon, and there are only Ave ways of drawing a divalent\r
graph on five vertices so that it shares exactly two non consecutive edges with the\r
pentagon. The six elements of any Z-Hussain graph of B3 can be seen in f g.\r
Since there is only one way of representing an Z-H set, all the Z-Hussain graphs\r
are isomorphic, (and hence, by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one possible biplane\r
of order three) and there are automorphisms of B3 taking any line to any other\r
line, i.e. the automorphism group is transitive in the line set, and therefore in the\r
set of Z-H sets. Furthermore, we will see that the group of automorphism of an Z-H\r
set is isomorphic to A5:\r
It must be a subgroup of ^'5 but it does not contain any transpositions or\r
4-cycles, since the action of both transpositions and 4-cycles always Sx two consec\u0002utive edges of the pentagon, therefore it is a subgroup of A5. If we consider the\r
action of a 3-cycle we see that all of them are automorphisms of the set of Z-Hussain\r
graphs, so the stabiliser of any Z-H set is in fact ^^5. As there are 11 lines in B3 and\r
the action is transitive, \\Aut{B3) \\ = 660.\r
We will now show that Aut{Bz) is simple, and since there is only one simple\r
group of order 660, that will prove that Aut{Bs) = PSL{2,11).\r
Take Z a line of B3, as the automorphism group of the Z-H set is isomorphic to\r
the alternating group A5, by Corollary 3.3.4. we get that\r
StabiV) = A^.\r
Furthermore, since ^^((Bs) is transitive on the set of lines, aU the stabihzers are\r
conjugate and ^fa6(Z) ^^1/^(^3) for any Z E /Zg,.\r
Let us assume that G = C n and Go^^^(53). For this to happen there must\r
be only one 11-Sylow subgroup in ^^((Bs). Since any two lines Z, Z' share two\r

embed a truncated cube in Klein's Riemann surface). Finally, both the combinato\u0002rial structure of the 3-biplane and that of the vertices of the truncated icosahedron\r

On the other hand, any element of order three is associated to two C7 groups\r
and therefore it fixes their corresponding sets of Wierstrass points (although it does\r
not fix the actual points). Since any element of order three fixes just two points on\r
Kg=3, it is immediate that it cannot fix a Wierstrass point, therefore the stabilizer\r
of any point is trivial (when considering the action of an S4) and the action of S'4\r
on the set of Weierstrass points is transitive. •\r
Every embedding of an ^4 into PSL{2,7) is related to an embedding of a\r
truncated cube into Kg=3 in which the Weierstrass points of Kg=3 are the vertices\r
of the truncated cube. We can choose one of the groups S4 displayed in the table\r
85

in chapter two, each one containing four subgroups isomorphic to C3. The action\r
of any C3 < on ^(^^=3 Exes two points on the surface, therefore to every\r
embedding of an into f 5'Z,(2, 7) we can attach four pairs of points on the surface\r
of Klein's quartic, each of these pairs will define a diagonal of the (truncated) cube.\r
Each point hxed by an element of order three is the centre of an equilateral\r
triangle of area y whose vertices are three Weierstrass points (since they are fixed by\r
elements of order 7). In that way we get a triangle corresponding to the truncation\r
of one vertex of the cube for every point hxed by an element of order three in the ^'4\r
we are considering (i.e. two triangles for each C3). Repeating the same operation\r
with every subgroup C3 in ^'4 we get the eight triangular faces of the truncated\r
cube. The remaining edges of the truncated cube are easy to And, since every two\r
cycle of 5'4 will hx two other points on the surface, these points correspond to edges\r
centres of the cube. For a picture of a truncated cube inside J^g=3 see\r
There are fourteen such embeddings into two conjugacy classes, but if we allow\r
orientation reversing automorphism of ^7^=3 they will form a unique conjugacy\r
class. To visualize the remaining six embeddings in class it suSces\r
to rotate the truncated cube around the center point of the hyperbohc polygon\r
shown in To get a representative of the second class, we have to reAect\r
the truncated cube along the vertical diagonal of the polygon. To hnish with this\r
section we intend to provide a model for the geometric action of f5'Z'(2, 7) on seven\r
points alongside with a model for the 2-biplane inside Kg=2.\r
The algebraic action of f 5'i^(2, 7) on seven points is easy to describe as the\r
action of PSL{2, 7) on its seven subgroups isomorphic to S4 within one conjugacy\r
class. Considering that every ^'4 in ^t(^(A'g=3) is connected to an embedding of the\r
86

truncated cube, we can see the geometric action of f6'i,(2,7) on seven points as\r
the permutation of the seven truncated cubes in a conjugacy class.\r
For a diagram of the 14 truncated cubes inside we only need to rotate\r
the class representatives displayed in ^.,5. around the central vertex of the\r
hyperbolic polygon.\r
We can now consider the diagonals of each truncated cube in a conjugacy class\r
as a bit of a combinatorial structure and thus we get 28 bits in seven sets of four. We\r
can call each of these sets /meg, so that each line is in fact a truncated cube within a\r
conjugacy class. Furthermore, we can choose seven new sets of four diagonals, that\r
we shall call so that every point shares only a bit with four lines, and every\r
line shares just one bit with four points. In doing so what we get is a model for\r
the 2-biplane inside -^^^=3. We have seen that each diagonal can be associated to a\r
C3 < f 5'JL(2,7) and that the set of "lines" is identified with the set of subgroups\r
5'4 in one conjugacy class. Using a similar reason, the set of "points" is identified\r
with the set of subgroups ^'4 in the other conjugacy class, as we can see in the table\r
in chapter two, where f stands for points and 2, for lines, and the coordinates of\r
the C3 label the incidence structure of the bits of the 2-biplane.\r

The two examples mentioned above Eire the only possible embeddings of a 3-\r
biplane as a regular dessin in a Riemann surface, as any other epimorphism from a\r
triangle group n] to G55 will produce torsion. Unfortunately none of them is\r
into a Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to f ,9jL(2,11).\r
Since we are trying to End embeddings of the 3-biplane that mirror as closely\r
as possible the characteristics of Singerman's embedding of the Pano plane, there\r
Eire two important questions that we need to solve:\r
- Is there any other way of embedding the 3-biplane in a "rigid way" into a\r
Riemann surface 5" such that v4M^(5') = f 5'i,(2,11)? That is, is it possible to embed\r
the bipartite graph representing the 3-biplane incidence structure conformally into\r
a Riemann surface S such that Ai6((5') = f 5'Z,(2,11) and so that the stabilizer of\r
the embedding is isomorphic to G55?\r
- Among the solutions to the previous question, can any of the surfaces 5" be\r
uniformized by a principal congruence group of a Hecke group in such a way\r
that the bits of the embedding can be thought of as cusps of G?\r
The answer to both questions is ahrmative, there are at least two surfaces 5^\r
that solve the 6rst question, and one of them is a positive answer to the second.\r
We need to relax some of the conditions for the embedding, since we know that\r
there is no solution for it among dessins. We chose to relax the conditions relating\r
to the "faces" of the embedding (as seen in a Walsh representation), therefore our\r
embedding will not be a dessin, but only a bipartite graph, since the connected com\u0002ponents of the complement of the graph (faces) will no longer be simply connected.\r
This relaxation implies algebraically that we will consider groups A' with three pe\u0002riods and signature where ^ ^ 0, as candidates for the epimorphism\r
onto G55. Unfortunately these groups are not rigid in the sense of Fuchsian groups,\r
and so we will place a restriction on them by studying only those that are subgroups\r
of triangle groups [(,m, that projects epimorphicaily onto f^i/(2,11).\r
Let us start then with a triangle group A = [/,m, that projects epimorphi\u0002cally via $ onto PSL(2,11) so that its kernel has index 660 and is torsion free. The\r
torsion free kernel condition limits the choice of periods for the triangle group to\r
the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11}. We need to impose a further condition: that there is a\r
subgroup A' < A with [A : A'] = 12 and signature\r
A = < g, [li, I21 ^3]\r
91

that is, three finite periods {U ^ 0) such that the restriction is an epimorphism\r
onto G55. This implies that A' has one of the following signatures:\r
= or A' = (g;[5,5,5])\r
which implies that there is at least a period of order multiple of 5 in A, using the\r
condition that limits the choice of periods in A, we can eissume that A = [5,\r
Since the index of A' in A is 12, we have that 12//(A) = //(A'), that is:\r
5 55 \\5m n\r
where m , » E {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11} and ^ E N. Out of the set of hyperbolic triangle\r
groups that could be candidates for A, we can see that only [2,5,11], [3,5,11] and\r
[5,6,11] satisfy all the conditions, and therefore are the only ones that might allow\r
an embedding of the kind described above.\r
In the first case ([2,5,11]), which seems to be the most interesting, the embed\u0002ding will be into a Riemann surface of genus p = 70. In that case we will be able\r
to extend the 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of a congruence subgroup of the\r
Hecke group\r
In the second case the underlying surface has genus p = 125, while in the leist\r
case A' has signature (3; [5,5,11]) and the underlying surface has genus p = 180. In\r
all three cases the bipartite graph has type (5,5,11) meaning that it is invariant by\r
rotations of order eleven around its "face" centres, or rotations of order 6ve around\r
its vertices. We will only cover the Erst two cases as the third one does not show\r
any interesting properties not covered by the other two cases."""

one set of 22 points that will correspond to the vertices of the bipartite graph, and\r
another one of 55 points that correspond to edge centres (bits).\r
We will call the image of the embedding of the group Ggg into the automor\u0002phism group of ^g=7o- k chapter two we have seen that there are twelve diSerent\r
subgroups of order 11 in f 6'Z,(2,11). If we consider them as subgroups of the au\u0002tomorphism group of J?g=7o, we can see that each subgroup C n fixes five points on\r
93

the surface, and no two subgroups Hx the same point, so we have 60 distinguished\r
points on the surface. If we remove from this set the five points fixed by the action\r
of jif (i.e. the five points hxed by C^i), we obtain a collection of 55 points that are\r
transitively permuted by the action of ^ and that corresponds to the bits of the\r
embedded graph.\r
The remaining 22 points arise naturally when we consider the action of the\r
order five subgroups of 77. There are 11 such subgroups, each one Axes two points\r
on the surface, and therefore we have found the 22 points we needed. The choice of\r
colour is arbitrary, we need to hx one of the C5, for example C^'° , and paint one\r
of its fix points white, the other black. If we let acts on this pair of coloured\r

points by a Cg can be seen as a diagonal of the (truncated) icosahedron embedded\r
on the surface. Every point in that pan- is the centre of an hyperbolic equilateral\r
pentagon, whose vertices are points fixed by elements of order 11 and in that manner\r

obtain a picture for the truncated icosahedron inside Ag-70, although given the big\r
genus of the surface and the low order of the highest order automorphism of the\r
surface, it shows as much as it conceals and so we will not display it here.\r
There are twenty two embeddings of a truncated icosahedron inside Ag=7o, dis\u0002tributed into two conjugacy classes, although orientation reversing automorphisms\r
of the surface will take one class onto the other. We will hnish this section by\r
showing a model for a geometric action of f 5'Z(2,11) on eleven points that is re\u0002lated to a model for the 3-triplane inside _Rg=7o (The definition of a triplane follows\r
naturally as a generalization of the one for a biplane).\r
The geometric action of f 11) on eleven objects is related to the combi\u0002natorial objects that are stabilized by A5 < f ^2/(2,11) and that can be embedded\r
into Ag=7o, so the truncated icosahedron is the obvious choice for it. If we consider\r
the eleven truncated icosahedra inside a conjugacy class, each one is linked to one\r
embedding of /Is inside a conjugacy class, and so the algebraic action of f 5'i,(2,11)\r
on the A5 of one class is analogous to its geometric action on the embedding of the\r
truncated icosahedron corresponding to that A5.\r
Following the same ideas displayed in the sections regarding the Fano plane,\r
we can consider the diagonals of each embedding of a truncated icosahedron as\r
bits of a combinatorial structure, and we can label them using the labelling for the\r
subgroup isomorphic to C5 in f5'i^(2,ll) whose pull-back into A'u((Eg=7o) &xes\r
that diagonal. If we do so, we can take the icosahedrons in one conjugacy class\r
as "lines" of an incidence structure (CZoss iL in the table in chapter 2) and the\r
icosahedrons in the other conjugacy class as "points" (CZasg f ). If we check the\r

a 7 period in F since it has got one cycle of length 1. We have seen that f has\r
signature (p; [3,3,7]) and the condition //(F) = 8//((7) implies that p = 1.\r
1.3. Maps\r
In this section we want to explore the relationship between maps and hyper\u0002maps. We will define maps and hypermaps over Riemann surfaces and explain\r
the geometric and algebraic approach to these objects. A current term, due to\r
Grothendieck, to refer to both maps and hypermaps is "dessin d'enfants" or just\r
deagm. For an introduction to maps theory see [JSl], for a discussion of the wide\r
scope of dessin theory see [Sch].\r
Intuitively, a map is a decomposition of a surface into polygonal two-cells\r
or faces. That leaves a structure on the surface composed by the interior of the\r
polygons (faces), edges and vertices that constitute the map, for an easy example\r
of these we can think of the platonic solids as maps on the surface of the sphere,\r
picture below depicts the map on the sphere induced by a tetrahedron.\r
The set of vertices and edges of the map constitute a graph which is embedded\r
into the surface. Although we will allow a very general class of graph, we will\r
require the graph to be connected and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges, this number is the of the vertex. Our graph can\r
contain edges with one or two vertices, the edges with two vertices correspond to\r
our everyday perception of an edge, as for the edges with only one vertex, they can\r
either be a Zoop or a /ree ecfpe, the difference being that a loop is homeomorphic\r
to a circle, while a free edge is homeomorphic to a segment. Every face would\r
be surrounded by a finite number of edges, and this number is the valency of the\r
14

face, faces should be simply-connected. An oZZoiuecf is a graph satisfying the\r
previous conditions. For a picture of a generic map on a sphere see Fip. 6^\r
6 ^"4 lb'\r
Two o/mapa on (Ae gpAere\r
A Aypergrop/i is a generalization of this idea where we allow any Enite number\r
of vertices to lie on an edge. We will meet some hypergraphs when we describe\r
Enite geometries in chapter three. Our only restriction on the structure of the\r
hypergraph is that it is connected, and that to every vertex there is only a Enite\r
number of incident edges. We can dehne a Momorp/iigm as a bijection\r
/ between the vertex sets of two (hyper) graphs that induces a bijection between\r
the edges set so that the incidence structure is preserved, that is, if\r
I(P) e f{E)\r
where P is any vertex contained in the edge E.\r
We will start with the topological approach to a map, then describe the al\u0002gebraic structure of it, and use algebraic notions to generalize the concept of map\r
to that of a hypermap. Nevertheless, after the topological and the algebraic ap\u0002proaches have been explained, we will need to provide maps with a richer structure,\r
namely the analytic structure of their underlying Riemann surface.\r
Definition 1.3.1. A map Ai on a compact surface X is an embedding of an\r
allowed graph Q into X such that the components of X — Q are simply-connected.\r
We call the components of % — ^ the /acea of Ai.\r
Definition 1.3.2. A topological map Top{M) is a triple {Q,V,S) where G is\r
an allowed graph, V its set of vertices and 5" is the underlying surface.\r
15

Definition 1.3.3. Let e be an edge of a map M. with endpoints ei and eg\r
(that are identified in the case of loops), and let m be a point in e which is not ei\r
nor 62- We can now divide e into two segments mi and 7712. A of a map Ai\r
is a pair consisting of a vertex and an incident segment. If there are no free edges\r
then every edge has two darts.\r
In we can see the three different kinds of edges on a map with their\r
corresponding darts.\r
Z/Oop, edpe ond yree e(f^e\r
We can associate an algebraic structure to the topological construction de\u0002scribed above. We will first consider the map M. with its set of darts that we will\r
call 0+, the superscript + means that we are working with maps on orientable\r
structures, since we are only interested in Riemann surfaces, we will not cover the\r
definition of maps for Klein surfaces, for a survey of that topic see [BS] and [IS].\r
We define two permutations of [2+ as follows:\r
- ro consists of cycles formed by going round each vertex in an anticlockwise\r
direction.\r
• ri is the product of the transpositions that interchange the two darts on an\r
edge or loop, and fix the dart on a free edge.\r
The product r2 = consist of cycles which define anticlockwise rotations\r
of the darts about each face of Ai. If we let G+ = < rg, ri > be the group generated\r
by ro and ri, G+ is a subgroup of 5"^^,the group of permutations on the elements\r
of Q+, that is transitive because the graph underlying Ai is connected. G_|_ is the\r
moMOcfromi/ of Ai, we could have called it the oriented monodromy group,\r
but as we have already stated, we will only consider maps on orientable surfaces.\r
We define the algebraic map of Ai to be:\r
(A/p A<)+ = (G+,n+,ro,ri).\r
16

Exampl e 1.3.4. The tetrahedron in Fig. 1.1.a) has 0+ = {n \\ n = 1...12} as\r
its set of darts, and the permutations are:\r
ro (1,2,3)(4,5,6)(7,8,9)(10,11,12 )\r
n (1,9)(2,11)(3,6)(4,10)(5,7)(8,12)\r
7-2 ^ (1,8,11)(2,10,6)(3,5,9)(4,12,7 )\r
Exampl e 1.3.5. The map in Fig. 1.1.b) has 0+ = {n \\ n = 1...15} as its set\r
of darts. The permutations are:\r
ro (1,2,3,4,5)(6,7,8)(9,10,11,12)(13,14,15 )\r
n (1,11)(2)(3)(4,15)(5,6)(7,14)(8,9)(10,13)(12)\r
rz ^ (1,10,15,3, 2)(4,14,6)(5,8,12,11)(7,13,9)\r
Definition 1.3.6. We define an algebraic map as a quadruple:\r
:= (G'+,^]+,ro,ri)\r
where is a Suite set, (7+ is a transitive subgroup of the group of permutations\r
generated by rg and ri, and where ri is a product of disjoint transpositions.\r
We call r2 = To any oriented algebraic map there is a topological map\r
so that AZ^+(Ai) =\r
If ro and r2 have orders m and a respectively, we say that Ai (resp. yl"'") haa\r
(m, Ti), that is, the Z.c.m. of the valencies of vertices and faces are m and M\r
respectively.\r
Given the triangle group T[m, 2,n] with a presentation of the form:\r
r[m, 2, n] =< a, b | a™' = b"^ = = 1 >\r
and a map Ai of type (m, n) with AZp"^(Ai) = r2+,ro,ri), we can de6ne an\r
epimorphism 6 : T[m, 2, n] —sendin g a to tq and 6 to ri.\r
Let G+a — {p G G+lap = a } be the stabiliser of a E then M =\r
is called a fundamental group of M in T[m, 2,n]. A different choice of dart a will\r
yield a group conjugated to M in r[m, 2, n], hence to every map Af of type (m, n),\r
we can associate a conjugacy class of fundamental groups in r[m, 2, n] (see [JSl]).\r
Next, we identify (1+ with the set of right M-cosets in r[m, 2, n] by the bijection\r
MA —a!(/i^). Taking M* = jiL'er(^), the core of M (the intersection of all the\r
conjugates of M by elements of F), we can identify G+ with the quotient group\r
17

r[m, 2, M]/M* by M*p ^ so that the action of a (respectively 6) corresponds to\r
the permutation ro (respec. ri) in (7+. In this way we see that any finite index\r
subgroup M < [m, 2,i s a fundamental group of some oriented map.\r
It is possible to generalize the concept of dart, so that we can define maps\r
on Klein surfaces, this generalization relates in a natural way to the inclusion of\r
crystallographic triangle groups into NEC triangle groups, see [BS].\r
Another important property of a fundamental group M of a map Ai is that\r
the surface 5" in which the map is embedded is uniformized (not uniquely) by M in\r
the sense that:\r
^=M\u0002To every topological map corresponds an algebraic map, and from any algebraic\r
map we can recover a topological map. Unfortunately, this relationship does not\r
make both categories equivalent, since there are many ways of altering a topological\r
map via an homeomorphism of the underlying surface without a counterpart in the\r
side of algebraic maps. We want to have a geometrical definition of map that\r
allows us to translate results from the algebraic category to the geometrical one,\r
and in order to do so, we need to define maps on surfaces in such a way that the\r
isomorphisms between them correspond to isomorphisms between their underlying\r
surfaces. These maps when considered on Riemann surfaces were originally called\r
mopg by [JS], we will call them maps, since their isomorphisms\r
correspond to mappings that preserve the analytic structure of their underlying\r
surfaces. The first step to define them is to define universal maps and quotients of\r
maps.\r
The NEC triangle group r(2, m,») acts naturally on 7^ and has a triangle T\r
of angles a = §, 6 = ^ and c = ^ as its fundamental polygon. If we draw a dart\r
on the side (z6, and let F act on ab with that dart, we get a map on 7^ with all the\r
edges of the same length and such that all vertices have order m and aU faces have\r
order m, this is the map o/ (ype\r
Let Ai = (^,V,5') be a topological map of type (m,n), then there is an\r
algebraic map ^ = yl/p(Ai) associated with it, from where we can calculate a\r
fundamental group M of M.. We have seen that M < (2,m, n) and therefore M\r
acts on the universal map Ai of type (m, n) sending vertices to vertices, edges\r
18

to edges and face centres to face centres. The quotient of this action is a map\r
vM of type (m, zi) which is naturally embedded in the surface 5" by the covering\r
TT : P and which is topologically equivalent to Ai. Ai is an map of\r
VW.\r
Any analytic map, is in particular a topological map. We have proved that to\r
any algebraic map there is at least one topological map Ai so that .A =\r
Definition 1.3.7. Two maps M and M ' of type (m, n) embedded in the sur\u0002faces 6" and 5" are called if there is an analytic isomorphism\r
between the surfaces that takes the set of vertices, edges and faces of Ai to the set\r
of vertices, edges and faces of Ai' respectively.\r
If we consider the dehnition of an algebraic map, there is no reason why we\r
should restrict ourselves to quadruples where ri has order two, and not consider\r
groups where this condition is dropped. In fact, this property corresponds to the\r
fact that the edges have only two vertices, so by allowing a higher order in ri, we will\r
study maps whose edges contain more than two vertices, and whose fundamental\r
group is a Snite index subgroup of the triangle group Those objects are\r
what we call Ayjcermopa.\r
1.4. Hypermaps\r
Definition 1.4.1. An oriented algebraic hypermap A consists of a finite set of\r
objects 0+ that we will call the bits (or brins) of A, together with two permutations\r
ro,ri G and a group G+ = < ro,ri > such that G+ is transitive in\r
(As before we will drop the word "orientable" since we will only consider Rie\u0002mann surfaces). We call G+ the protip of the hypermap Vl. The cycles\r
ro and correspond to and in precisely the same way as\r
the cycles generating the monodromy group of a map corresponds to vertices and\r
edges, while the permutation rg = (rori)"^ corresponds to The hyper\u0002map is represented by the quadruple ((9_|_,f]+,ro,ri), and if n has order we say\r
that ^ has (/o,4,^2)' The of is equal to |r2+|.\r
We extend the notion of fundamental group to hypermaps by considering the\r
natural epimorphism ^ : r[Zo, Zi, Zg] ^ G+ in the same way as we did with maps. We\r
therefore can deEne a of ./I to be M = ^"^(G+a)- We will use\r
19

the word o/^ebrozc (feagm to refer to either an oriented algebraic map or hypermap\r
indistinctly.\r
Although from the algebraic point of view there is little difference between a\r
map and a hypermap, it is not intuitively immediate how to view a map on a surface\r
when we allow each edge to meet as many vertices as necessary, several authors\r
have suggested different ways of doing it, we wiU first give an abstract definition of\r
topological hypermap on Riemann surfaces and then describe the representations\r
by CoTi, James and\r
Definition 1.4.2. A topological hypermap % on n. Riemann surface 5" is a\r
triple (5", y ) where ^ and y are closed subsets of 5" such that:\r
a j := E ' n y is a non-empty finite set. 0+ is called the set of (or\r
^ U y is connected.\r
The components of E' and y are homeomorphic to closed discs. The compo\u0002nents of E' are called while the component of y are the\r
The components of 5" — (E'uy ) are homeomorphic to open discs and are called\r
/ig/peT/aces.\r
We will call an object which is either a topological map or\r
hypermap on a Riemann or Klein surface.\r
For an explanation of dessins on Klein surfaces see [IS].\r
T h e Cori representatio n\r
In the Cori representation (see [Co]) hypervertices and hyperedges are rep\u0002resented by closed polygons called 0-faces and 1-faces respectively (we will colour\r
0-faces with a light grey and 1-faces with a dark grey), each polygon having as many\r
sides as the length of the cycle it represents, while hyperfaces are represented by\r
open polygons called 2-faces each one having twice as many sides as the order of the\r
hyperface they represent (2-faces are painted white). 0-faces are mutually disjoint,\r
as are 1-faces, and they intersect each other only in their vertices, which represent\r
the bits, each bit shared by precisely one hypervertex and one hyperedge. As the\r
hypermap is embedded in an orientable surface A, we can de&ne an anticlockwise\r
permutation of the bits around each 0-face and each 1-face consistent with the ori\u0002entation of these permutations corresponds to ro and respectively. If we call\r
y the set of aU O-faces, and ^ the set of aU 1-faces, then y U ^ is a closed set in\r
i?, and the components of R — {V U E) are the 2-faces, which are open polygons\r
20

that induce the permutation rg = (ror^^). As 2-faces have an even number of bits,\r
^2 permute the bits acting as the square of the clockwise permutation around each\r
hyperface.\r
The Cori representation is very easy to draw and shows some symmetries of\r
the hypermap in a clear way, but has the drawback of differentiating between hy\u0002pervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces in a way that seems unnatural if we regard\r
the algebraic definition of the hypermap.\r
T h e Jame s representatio n\r
The James representation (see [Ja]) displays the trinity among hypervertices,\r
hyperedges and hyperfaces in a more natural way. This time O-faces, l-faces and\r
2-faces will aU be polygons with twice as many sides as the orders of the elements\r
they represent. The intersection of any two i-faces is always empty, and O-faces\r
and l-faces intersect along one side. To place the bits, we need to consider the\r
three-valent map on ^ dehned by the sides of these polygons, in such a map every\r
vertex heis order three and each edge separates faces of diSFerent labels (there are\r
no two i-faces with a common edge). Going anticlockwise around each vertex, we\r
get a permutation of the faces that is either (0,1,2) or (0,2,1), if the permutation\r
is (0,1,2), the vertex is called a bit. Once the bits are placed, the permutations\r
ro, ri and rg follow in the same way as with the Cori representation.\r
Cori James\r
Con: Jamea Aypermap %e.\r
To go from the Cori representation to the James representation, we push to\u0002gether the hypervertices and hyperedges with a common bit, thereby changing the\r
bit in the Cori representation (one point) to an edge in the James representation\r
one of whose vertices is a bit, and doubling the number of sides of every 0-face and\r
1-face.\r
21

T h e Walsh representatio n\r
In order to introduce this representation first presented in [Wal], we need to\r
define a mop, that is, a map in which the vertices have one of two colours,\r
and such that aU edges connect vertices of different colours. Starting now at the\r
Cori representation, we substitute every 0-face by a 0-vertex (where the number\r
of the vertex refers to its colour) and every 1-face by a 1-vertex, and we join two\r
vertices together if and only if their respective 0-face and 1-face intersect in a bit,\r
therefore substituting each bit shared by the 0-face and 1-face for an edge joining\r
the two new vertices. We have now a bipartite map on the surface, with the same\r
number of edges as the number of bits of the original hypermap, the vertices in the\r
bipartite map stand for the hypervertices and hyperedges, while the faces of the\r
bipartite map represents the hyperfaces of the original hypermap. The permutation\r
ro (resp. ri) corresponds to anticlockwise rotation around each 0-vertex (resp. 1-\r
vertex) while r2 corresponds to the clockwise permutation of the edges around a\r
face.\r
Fig. 1.4. Walsh representation of Tie\r
Exampl e 1.4.3. The hypermap 'He has 0+ = {n \\ n 1...12} as its set of\r
bits, and the permutations are:\r
ro (1,2)(3,12,10,6)(4,5,7)(8,9,11)\r
ri ^ (2,3)(5,6,7)(9,10,12)(1,4,8,11)\r
r2-4(l,8,ll)(2,10,6)(3,5,9)(4,12,7)\r
We have already defined the cycles ro, ri and 7-2 = ^ for the hypermap\r
when we explained the Cori model. If we let G+ :=< ro,ri >, (?+ is a transitive\r
subgroup of 5"^^, and we define the or%en(e(f oZgebrmc of to be:\r
XZ^+(?/) = (G+,n+,ro,ri).\r
22

We say that the hypermap has (g/joe (Z,m, n) if ro, ri and r2 have orders Z, m\r
and n respectively.\r
It is clear that if any element of the set (Z, m, n} is 2, then the quadruple will\r
be an algebraic map up to duality. We will use the name cfeaam to refer\r
to either algebraic maps or algebraic hypermaps.\r
We can embed % into the surface:\r
U\r
which is a Riemann surface since M is a subgroup of a crystallographic triangle\r
group.\r
To define an analytic structure on hypermaps, we follow a similar procedure\r
to the one explained in the case of maps. We Erst define the wnzweraaJ of\r
type (/,m, n) by using a triangle with angles 7r// (labelled 0), yr/m (labelled 1) and\r
7r/n (labelled 2). By the action of r(Z,m, n) on that triangle, we get a map over\r
7^ with three diSerent types of vertices, if we delete the vertices of type 2 and the\r
edges meeting these vertices, and paint with white the vertices of type 0 and with\r
black those of type 1, we get a Walsh representation of the uniferaof Ai/permap of\r
type (/, m, yi) which we shall call 'K(/, m, n) or simply % when no confusion arises.\r
If = (6", y ) is a topological hypermap of type (Z, /M, 7%), we can calculate\r
its algebraic hypermap and its fundamental group H < r(/,m, n). Letting H act\r
on "K, we get a quotient hypermap H/H embedded into V/H^ and we call it the\r
dianalytic hypermap corresponding to ?/. If ^ contains no orientation reversing\r
elements, by using the Fuchsian triangle group r[l, m, n] for the orientable universal\r
we get an analytic hypermap corresponding to\r
Definition 1.4.4. Two hypermaps 1-1 and H' of type embedded in\r
the surfaces ^ and 5" are if there is an analytic isomorphism\r
between the surfaces that sends the set of hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces\r
of "K to their corresponding sets in\r
1.5. Group of Automorphisms of a dessin\r
Since we have dehned maps and hypermaps as particular cases of dessins, I will\r
dehne morphisms in the category of dessins, and the natural restrictions of these\r
morphisms can be translated in an easy way to either maps or hypermaps. We will\r
23

use the name vertices, edges and faces of a dessin to refer to either vertices, edges\r
and faces of a map, or hypervertices, hyperedges and hyperfaces of a hypermap.\r
Whenever no distinction is needed, I will use "bits" to refer to darts and bits.\r
Results in this section are well known in dessin theory, and most of them have\r
been reworded from [JSl]. When they are more general than the original result,\r
the proof still follows along the same lines.\r
Definition 1.5.1. We will say that 0 is a topological morphism between the\r
dessins D and D' with topological structures given by (5", jF, y ) and\r
if : 5" —> 5" is a topological covering between the underlying surfaces (possibly\r
ramihed, all branch points having hnite order), preserving orientation and so that\r
<^(^) = and <^(y) = r .\r
We say that D D' if there is a morphism from D to D'.\r
Theorem 1.5.2. Let D and D' be dessins of type (Z, n), then %) covers D' if\r
and only if there are groups M and M ' which are representatives of the conjugacy\r
classes of fundamental groups of D and D' respectively, such that M < M'.\r
Definition 1.5.3. Given two dessins V and V embedded respectively in S\r
and we will say that : D —> is an morpAzam between the dessins if\r
is a topological morphism between the dessins and an analytic morphism between\r
the underlying surfaces.\r
This definition of morphism between dessins is more restrictive than the one\r
originally suggested in [JSl], since we impose the condition that the morphism\r
preserves the analytic structure of the surface. It corresponds to the "Riemann\r
morphism" between maps described in that paper.\r
Definition 1.5.4. We will say that the pair of functions i/j = (f,g ) is an\r
a/pebrozc mofpAwm between the dessins D and D' with algebraic structures given\r
by (G, Q, ro, ri) and by ( C, rg, r^) respectively, if / : > r]' is an onto function\r
and p : G ^ is a group epimorphism such that p(ro) = fg, p(ri) = and the\r
following diagram commutes:\r
X G ^ 0\r
/ 9 f\r
ri' X G' ^ f]'\r
that is, f{ar) = f{a)g{r), for any r G G acting on any a G O.\r
24

We will say that xp = {f,g) as in Definition 1.5.4. is an algebraic isomorphism\r
between the dessina %) and D' with algebraic structure as above if / : fZ —> is a\r
bijective map and p : G — C is a group isomorphism.\r
Two topological dessins D and are if there exists a topological\r
morphism ^ between them, such that is a homeomorphism between the underlying\r
surfaces, therefore the group of topological automorphisms of a dessin is too ample\r
for our purposes, on the other hand, the group of analytic automorphisms of a dessin\r
is hnite, and in fact is a subgroup of the group of automorphisms of the underlying\r
surface. The analytic definition of isomorphism introduces some rigidity in the\r
structure of topological dessin that is needed if we want to define a one to one\r
correspondence between algebraic and geometric structures.\r
Definition 1.5.5. Two dessins D and %)' are or just\r
if there is an analytic isomorphism between them.\r
Propositio n 1.5.6. Any dessin V which is equivalent to an analytic dessin\r
D' is an analytic dessin itself.\r
Corollary 1.5.7. The following results are equivalent for dessins embedded\r
in Riemann surfaces:\r
- The analytic dessins %) and D' are isomorphic.\r
- The algebraic dessins AZp(D) and are isomorphic.\r
- The oriented algebraic dessins and are isomorphic.\r
We can now define the class V of all the analytic dessins isomorphic to V and\r
the class A of all the algebraic dessins isomorphic to A.\r
Theorem 1.5.8. For any class A there is only one class V such that, given\r
V e V, Alg{T>) G A. And for any class V there is only one class A so that the\r
analytic dessins associated with the algebraic dessins in .A are all contained in D.\r
Corollary 1.5.9. Analytic dessins with morphisms and algebraic dessins with\r
morphisms are two equivalent categories.\r
Therefore, we can define the functors and that induce mutually inverse\r
bijections between the isomorphism classes of oriented algebraic and analytic dessins\r
of finite type.\r
Theorem 1.5.10. Let Dy and D2 be subgroups of r[/o, /i, h] of finite index so\r
that they are fundamental groups of some dessins, then, they give rise to isomorphic\r
analytic dessins if and only if they are conjugate in r[/o, h]-\r
25

Theorem 1.5.11. If D has fundamental group D < T(lo,h,l2), then the full\r
group of automorphisms of V is:\r
where is the normahzer of D in r(foXi,^2)- Now we can assume that\r
the dessin can be embedded in a Riemaim surface, in which case, the group of\r
orientation preserving automorphisms of D is:\r
We will say that a dessin is if its group of automorphisms acts transi\u0002tively on the set of bits. Regular dessins corresponds to dessins with the greatest\r
degree of symmetry. If we relax the transitivity condition, and request only that\r
all the vertices have the same valency, all the edges have the same valency, and all\r
the faces have the same valency, we get unz/orm dessins. Every regular dessin is\r
uniform, but the converse is false.\r

Chapte r Two\r
PSL(2,p) and Hecke groups\r
This chapter is divided into two main parts. The Arst one (2.A.) studies the\r
structure of the family of Snite groups jP^Z,(2,p) where p E Z is prime, focusing\r
in particular in the cases where p E {5,7,11}. These cases are covered in three\r
separate sections.\r
In the second part (2.B.) we will introduce jif" (for n > 3), the family of Hecke\r
groups of the hrst kind. Two separate sections have been used to describe the main\r
properties of which is the modular group, and\r
While the Hecke groups and are important for our work because they\r
provide us with a tool for the arithmetic characterization of the two main combi\u0002natorial structures embeddings described in chapter four, (Singerman's embedding\r
of the Fano plane, and the 3-biplane embedding into we are also interested\r
in PSL{2,7) and PSL{2,11), because they are isomorphic to the automorphism\r
groups of the Fano plane and the 3-biplane respectively.\r
27

2.A. The structure of f\r
Let us call 5'2(2,p) := where p is a prime and p > 2, i.e. the set of all\r
2 x 2 matrices with coefBcients in the held Zp such that the determinant is equal to\r
1. f5'i^(2,p) is SZ,(2,p) modulo its center, that is, modulo (7, - 7 ) where 7 is the\r
identity matrix.\r
Propositio n 2.A.I. PSL{2,p) where p > 3 prime, is a non-commutative\r
finite group of order\r
p(p - l)(p + 1)\r
2\r
Proo f That PSL{2,p) where p > 3 prime is non-commutative is easily seen\r
by considering for example matrices\r
"= ( o 1 ) J\r
in f 5'Z,(2,p) and checking that ^ 6a.\r
To calculate its order we will count all matrices\r
- a;?/ ^ 0: There are f — 1 choices for a; and p — 1 choices for ?/, we can then\r
choose ( in p ways and for each choice of a;, i/, ( there is only one possible choice\r
for z. That yields — 1)^ elements of this form.\r
- a;?/ — 0: If we aasume a; = 0 then there are p choices for ( and p — 1 choices\r
for y. Once x, y, t are fixed there is only one possible value for z. If y = 0 the\r
same reasoning applies and so there are 2p{p — 1) matrices of this form.\r
We have proved that \\SL{2,p)\\ = p{p — l)(p + 1) and the order of PSL{2,p)\r
follows naturally from the fact that \\PSL(2,p}\\ = [SL(2,p) : (±/)]. •\r
It is well known that every group PSL{2,p) acts transitively on a set of p + 1\r
elements, and we will prove it geometrically in the following lines. In order to\r
see this action geometrically, we call Pp the projective line defined over the field\r
Zp. Every element in Pp = {0,l,..., p — l,oo} can be represented by a pair of\r
homogeneous coordinates [r : s] (where r, 5 E Zp), so that [r : g] stands for:\r
oo if s = 0\r
where ^ = rs\r
(mod p) if 5 ^ 0\r
28

As we have already mentioned in chapter 1, we will be using the standard\r
abuse of notation whereby elements of f 5'Z,(2,p) are thought of as matrices, and\r
we will associate to every element M G f a bijection of Pp dehned in the\r
usual way:\r
where as usual /M(oo) = if c ^ 0 (mod p) and /M(oo) = co if c = 0 (mod p).\r
It is easy to see that the image of z by /M does not depend on the choice of\r
homogeneous coordinates for z. As /M is a bijection in the finite set Pp, we can\r
treat it as a hnite permutation and End its representation as a product of disjoint\r
cycles. That this action is transitive is easy to see since\r
a= Q J ) . i= J ) eP5'L(2,p)\r
and the action of o on the points of Pp is a cyclic permutation of the finite points\r
(i.e. those which admit coordinates [r : 1], r E Zp) while the action of 6 swaps oo\r
and 0.\r
Propositio n 2.A.2. PSL(2,p) acts doubly transitively on Pp.\r
Proo f If we consider the ordered pair (a, b) E Pp with a ^ b (mod p) and\r
oo 0 {o, 6}, we see that the matrix\r
e-PSi(2.p )\r
takes the ordered pair (0, oo) to (a, 6). If oo E {a, 6}, we need to consider two cases\r
separately:\r
- If 6 = oo we take = 1 and = 0, and then sends (0, oo) to (o, 6).\r
If o = oo then we can take\r
and the action is doubly transitive.\r
However, the action of f 5'Z,(2,p) on Pp is not triply transitive in general, as\r
we can see with {0,1, oo} and (0,1,3} for p — 7.\r
29

Propositio n 2.A.3. Given p,q e Z prime numbers so that p = I (mod q),\r
there is only one non commutative group G of order |G| = pq that we shall call\r
Gpg. The structure of Gp, is given by\r
Cp X Cg = < /, e I /P = = 1 >\r
where w G Z* and — g. Therefore the structure of the semidirect product\r
is independent of the choice of it.\r
Proof As p is prime there is a subgroup Cp of order p in G, and by Sylow's\r
theorem the number TV of these subgroups satisfy\r
TV = 1 (mod p) and N | q.\r
Therefore TV = 1 and using Sylow's theorem again Cp < G and the structure of G is\r
given by:\r
< /, 6 I = 1 >\r
where it G Zp.\r
- Assume that or(Z2.(w) ^ g, then either it = 1 or ^ 1 (mod p). If it = 1\r
it is easy to see that G is commutative and therefore of no interest to us. On the\r
other hand, if i/^ ^ 1 (modp), using = 1 we get and by\r
making s — g we get / = By elementary group theory (u^ — 1) = 0 (mod p),\r
which is a contradiction.\r
• Once we have proved that ordz* (u) = q, all that remains is to prove that for\r
different it, the corresponding groups are isomorphic. To do so we choose a new\r
generator (where s ^ 0 (mod g)) so that we can rewrite the last identity\r
in the presentation of G as = 1. As g is prime ordz.(it^) = g and it^\r
runs through all order g elements in Z* therefore making it possible to derive any\r
other presentation from the one in proposition 2.A.3.\r
Not e If g is not prime, the result is not true, as we can see with the following\r
non-commutative and non isomorphic groups of order 20:\r
G = < A, / I = / ^ = V = 1 >\r
G' = < A, / I = /^ = = 1 >\r
In general, given p = 1 (mod , the number of non-isomorphic groups of the\r
form Cp X Cn is d{n), that is, the number of divisors of n.\r
30

Corollary 2.A,4. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and q another prime so that\r
p = 1 (mod g). There are only two groups of order pg:\r
- The cyclic group that we shall call Cpg.\r
- The semidirect product Cp x Cg = Gpg and is presented as in the previous\r
proposition. This group haa one normal subgroup of order p that we shall call\r
= < / >, and p subgroups of order g, that are conjugate by the action of the\r
elements of Cp.\r
Proof Let us call ^ any group so that |jif| — pg where p and g are as in\r
the hypothesis. If ^ is non commutative, we are in the hypothesis of the previous\r
proposition and we have finished. That Cp < H is unique and normal is true by\r
Sylow's theorem. If the order g subgroups were not conjugate by / , then one of\r
them should be normal in Tif (since for a certain s will belong to its normalizer)\r
which contradicts Sylow's theorem.\r
If ^ is commutative it must be the direct product of a Q, and a Cg, and\r
therefore, we have\r
Propositio n 2.A.5. Let p G Z be a prime p > 3 and n = 2 ^ . If we consider\r
the action of f 5'i^(2,p) on where a; G Pp. We get that = Cp x with\r
presentation:\r
where G Z* and (w) = M.\r
Proof Since the action of f 6'i^(2,p) on Pp is transitive, we can choose a; = oo\r
without loss of generality, and we see that\r
|^W(oo)| =\r
In fact, 5'(o6(oo) consists of any element of the form ^ ^ % j where a, 6 G Zp\r
and o ^ 0. If we call\r
1 / o 1\r
0 1 / \\ 0 ^\r
O\r
where ordz.(a) = 2^ — p — 1, we have that ord(/) = p and or(f(e) = n =\r
therefore e and / generate 5'(a6(oo). We can see that and then the\r
result is proved.\r
31

Lemm a 2.A.6. Let p be a prime p > 3, m G Z a positive integer so that p = I\r
(mod m). The following two subgroups of GL{2,p) have order pm:\r
| o , beZp , a"^ = l(modp) j\r
I o, 6 G Zp, (1^ = 1 (mod p)^\r
- j ( 0 1\r
hag presentation\r
< /i, / I /i": = /P = = 1 >\r
while a presentation for "Mpm is given by\r
< /i, / I = yp = = 1 >\r
where a G Z* and ordz* (s) = m and (r, m) = 1.\r
If m is odd we have that\r
If m is even the two groups are non isomorphic.\r
Proof An easy process of counting elements shows that the order of both\r
groups is pm, and using Sylow's theorems we get that the group structure is Cp xCm,\r
furthermore the groups are non commutative.\r
Once we have identif ed the structure of both groups, all we need to do is choose\r
suitable generators / and of order p and m respectively and study the action of\r
h on f . A choice for Qpm is / = j ^ , A = ^ ^ i ^ where ordz* (a) = m. It is\r
immediate to check that hfh'~^f~"' = 1 and the other possibilities arise when one\r
substitute h with where (s, m) = 1.\r
0 \\\r
A choice of generators for is / as before and ^ ^ I, bearing this\r
in mind, the rest of the proof is as above.\r
If m is odd we can dehne the isomorphism ^ by\r
a 6 \\ 6a\r
O\r
0 u " I 0 1\r
By working with the presentationa, it is easy to see that no isomorphism be\u0002tween the groups can be defined in the case where m is even.\r
32

Propositio n 2.A.7. Let p, g G Z be primes, p > 5 and q > 2 so that p = 1\r
(mod g), and let Gpg be as in Corollary 2.A.4. There are only two groups ^ up to\r
isomorphism so that < ^7 and [jif : Gpg] = 2. The two possibilities for ^ Eire\r
either :\r
H = Q2pq — Gpq X C2 or H = ?^2pg\u0002Proof As [jif : Gpg] = 2, we have that Gpg < so in order to describe ^ we\r
need to Snd all possible order two automorphisms (% : Gpg —Gpg . Taking Gpg\r
presented as in Proposition 2.A.3., and using the information from Corollary 2.A.4.\r
we get that o" must satisfy:\r
o'(e) =\r
where a, s 6 Zp and 6 E Zg.\r
- As = / we have that o = ± 1 (mod p).\r
- As (7 has to preserve the relations of Gpg, from\r
1 = (7(e/e-Y"" ) we get eVe"' ' =\r
but in particular we know that and since a ^ 0 (mod p), we have\r
= 1 (mod p) and so 6 = 1 (mod g).\r
If o = 1 (mod p), from cr^(e) = e we obtain a = 0 since otherwise Gpg should\r
be commutative.\r
We have proved that either cr is equal to the identity ci : Gpg —Gp g or is a\r
representative of the following family of order two automorphisms:\r
c-l\r
0-2 (/) = / 0-2 (e) = /''e/-\r
where g E Zp.\r
Since there is at least one element of order two in — Gpg, we can call it g and\r
assume that it induces the automorphism of Gpg, i.e. <7i(a;) — for % E {1,2}\r
and z E Gpg.\r
In the case of cri it is easy to see that p commutes with the generators of Gpg\r
and therefore we obtain jif ^ Gpg x C2 and from there\r
H = G2pq\u000233

For the action of erg, we need to prove that the same group H is generated\r
regardless of the choice of a G Zp. We can see that the equations relating the three\r
generators of ^ are:\r
1) e/e'V " == 1 2) = 1 3) = 1.\r
We can choose to change the generator e for E' — where n E Zp. If we\r
do so we get the following expressions\r
1) E/E- = 1 2) p/p / = 1 3) = 1.\r
As K ^ 1 and Zp is a field, if we let n = ^ we can easily show that any choice\r
of g yields the same group structure as s = 0. O\r
Given a group G, we will say that the subgroups F, Tif < G are\r
if given any element p E (3 we can express it in a unique way as a product p = //t\r
where / E f and A E If that is the case, we will write G = F .ff. It should be\r
noticed that two subgroups F, ^ < G are complementary if and only if G = F jf\r
and n = {!}.\r
A very interesting point about f5'Z,(2,p) goes back to Galois, who proved the\r
following result:\r
Theorem 2.A.8. For p > 11, there is no subgroup of PSL{2,p) which is\r
complementary to any of its p-subgroups.\r
That means that for p > 11 we cannot get jP5'Z^(2,p) = Zp, which im\u0002plies that there is no transitive action on p points for PSL{2,p) if p > 11. This\r
can be seen in the following way: as p is a factor of \\PSL(2,p)\\ and p^ is not\r
(see Proposition 2.A.I.), if there is a transitive action of PSL{2,p) on p points\r
{a;i,... ,a;p}, no order p element of f5'i^(2,p) can fix any {a;^} (otherwise p^ will\r
divide |f5'i^(2,p)|), which means that given g E f5'Z,(2,p) of order p, we have that\r
f ^Z,(2,p) = 5'(a6(a;i) < p > for any z E {1,... ,p}.\r
For the cases where p < 11 and f 5'i,(2,p) simple, that is, for p = 5, 7,11, we\r
know that the following holds:\r
f;9i:(2,5) = A4-C5 f^i,(2,7 ) = &.C 7 fgI,(2,ll) = A5.Ci i\r
and therefore PSL{2,p) acts transitively on p points. Through this work we will\r
try to explore this special feature geometrically, especially for the cases where p = 7\r
and p = 11.\r
34

2.1. The structure of f 5'j}(2,5)\r
We will not go into too much length for the case p = 5, but for the sake\r
of completeness, we will explain two ways of seeing its geometrical action on five\r
points, f 5'Z,(2,5) is isomorphic to A5, the alternating group on Ave elements that\r
is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of an icosahedron.\r
Lemm a 2.1.1. Ag is a simple group and it contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 12.\r
- 6 conjugate subgroups of order 5.\r
- 10 conjugate subgroups of order 3.\r
- 5 conjugate subgroups of order 12, each one isomorphic to A4.\r
This is not a full description of ail the subgroups of Ag and it merely describes\r
those subgroups order that are interesting for our work. For each conjugacy class,\r
we can End Eve diSierent embeddings of A4 into Ag, and its algebraic action on\r
Sve points is readily seen as its action on these embeddings by conjugation. Our\r
geometrical examples will mirror this action.\r
- Given an icosahedron, we can see its face centres as the vertices of hve tetra\u0002hedra inscribed in it. The symmetry group of the icosahedron permutes the\r
inscribed tetrahedra transitively.\r
• For another view of the same phenomenon, we can consider the set of edges\r
of the icosahedron and form pairs of antipodal edges. Thus we obtain fifteen\r
pairs of edges so that each pair defines a rectangle inscribed in the icosahedron.\r
The fifteen rectangles form triples of mutually orthogonal elements, and the\r
action of PSL(2,5) will permute transitively the five triples.\r
It is eaay to see how these two examples relate to the algebraic action explained\r
above, since the symmetry group of both the tetrahedron and a triple of mutually\r
orthogonal rectangles is isomorphic to A4.\r

2.2. The structure of PSL{2,7)\r
We will represent f 7) as the group generated by the following matrices\r
"=(- 1 I)' ''=( ? ? ) • '=( 0 1\r
where = abc = 7. This group has order 168 and appears as the group\r
of automorphisms of two important classical geometric objects: the Fano plane,\r
which will be covered together with other examples of finite geometries in the next\r
chapter, and Klein's quartic, that will be described in chapter four.\r
Lemma 2.2.1. [Kll] PSL{2,7) is a simple group of order 168 that contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 24.\r
' (2) ^ subgroups of order 3 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 21 subgroups isomorphic to C4 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 8 subgroups of order 7 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 8 subgroups of order 21 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 7 X 2 = 14 subgroups with 24 elements in two conjugacy classes. All of them\r
are isomorphic to 5'4.\r
Lemma 2.2.2. If we consider the action of PSL{2, 7) on P7 we see that:\r
1- There is a one-one correspondence between the C3 subgroups of f5'Z,(2,7)\r
and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P? given by the fixed point set of the action of\r
each C3 subgroup on IP7.\r
If a C3 subgroup corresponds to {a, b}, we will refer to it as\r
2- There is a one-one correspondence between the C? subgroups of f5'iL(2,7)\r
and the points of Py given by the Sxed point of the action of each Cy subgroup on\r
P 7 .\r
If a C7 subgroup corresponds to o E P7, we wiU refer to it as C7\r
3- Each subgroup of order 21 is isomorphic to C7 x C3. There is a one-one\r
correspondence between the subgroups of order 21 and the stabilisers of elements\r
in P7.\r
If a group of order 21 is the stabiliser of o E P7 we will refer to it as G21.\r
36

Proo f\r
1- We can take any order three element and calculate its cycle structure on P?,\r
for example:\r
0 —1\r
1 1\r
G f 5'iy(2,7) produces (0 6 oo) (1 3 5) (2) (4)\r
and we see that it fixes {2} and {4}. Given that all order three elements are\r
conjugate, they all have the same cycle structure and therefore every C3 fixes two\r
points in Py. Since f 5'Z,(2,7) acts transitively on pairs of points of Fy, the proof is\r
finished.\r
2- For the case of Cy we can do the same, if we start with z —> z + 1, it only\r
fixes 00. Since the group action is transitive on Py, the rest follows.\r
3- From Proposition 2.A.5. we know that for any a G P?\r
Stabi^a) = Cj X C3.\r
Since there are only eight subgroups of order 21, each one is the stabiliser of a\r
point. O\r

We will consider the geometric actions of PSL{2, 7) on seven points in chapter\r
four. Before we do that, we need to highlight the fact that the symmetric group on\r
four elements contains four subgroups of order three. We have already seen that\r
we can characterize all C3 in f 7) by their pair of Exed points (i.e. refer to\r
as (a, 6}), and we will label all subgroups of order 24 in f 5'Z,(2, 7) using this\r
characterization, that is, we will refer to each of them by the four pairs of points\r
that characterize its order three subgroups. That information is displayed in the\r
previous table and will be used in the next two chapters, the 14 embeddings of ^'4\r
have been separated into two conjugacy classes that we shall call class f and claas\r
i,. (see Example 2.3.3. in the following section).\r
2.3. The structure of P5X(2,11)\r
We can represent the group jP5'i,(2,11) in many different ways that are related\r
to triangle Fuchsian groups. We can see it as the group generated by the matrices\r
(or any other conjugation of this triple):\r
"=( ? V ) ' ''=(- 1 s ) ' '=(0 1\r
where — abc = I. This representation is useful when we study\r
epimorphisms from Fuchsian groups with three periods of type [2,5,11]. On the\r
other hand we can see it as the group generated by the matrices:\r
"=( 1 ~o')' ''=( 1 / ) • °=( o ?\r
where a? = = abc = I, and we will use these matrices for groups of type\r
[2,3,11]. There are other ways of presenting this group that we will cover in chapter\r
four.\r
f 5'i^(2,11) has order 660 and beside being the biggest group of the family of\r
f 6'Z^(2,p) that acts transitively on p points, it is the automorphism group of the\r
3-biplane, as we shall prove in chapter three.\r
Lemm a 2.3.1. [Di] PSL{2,11) is a simple group of order 660 and contains:\r
- No proper subgroup of order higher than 60.\r
- ( ^ ) = 66 subgroups of order 6ve in one conjugacy class.\r
- 12 subgroups of order eleven in one conjugacy class.\r
38

- 12 subgroups of order 55 in one conjugacy class.\r
- 2 X 11 = 22 subgroups of order 60 in two conjugacy classes. All of them are\r
isomorphic to Ag.\r
This list is not complete, there are some other subgroups of 11) that\r
are not mentioned here, however, it is complete for every order that is mentioned\r
in the lemma.\r
Lemma 2.3.2. If we consider the action of PSL(2,11) on P n we see that:\r
- There is a one-one correspondence between the C5 subgroups of f5'Z,(2,ll)\r
and the two point subsets {a, 6} of P n given by the Axed point set of the\r
action of each C5 subgroup on P n .\r
If a C5 subgroup corresponds to {o, 6}, we will refer to it as\r
- There is a one-one correspondence between the Cn subgroups of f6'Z,(2,11)\r
and the points of P n given by the hxed point of the action of each Cn subgroup\r
on Pii.\r
If a Cii subgroup corresponds to a E P n , we will refer to it aa\r
- Each subgroup of order 55 is isomorphic to Cn x C5. There is a one-one cor\u0002respondence between the subgroups of order 55 and the stabilisers of elements\r
in P7.\r
If a group of order 55 is the stabiliser of a E P? we will refer to it as Ggg.\r
The proof for the above lemma is similar to the proof for the corresponding\r
one in the case p — 7 (Lemma 2.2.2.) so we will omit it here.\r
The geometric actions of PSL{2,11) on eleven points will be covered in chapter\r
4, and as we have done before we need to explain a way of classifying the embeddings .\r
of Ag into f 5'iL(2,11). We have seen that there are six possible embeddings of C5\r
into v45, and that each C5 < f5'Z,(2,ll) can be labelled with its pair of hxed\r
points on Pii. Following the same idea as in f 6'i^(2,7), we wiU characterize every\r
^5 < f 5'i^(2,11) by a sextuple of pairs of points as it is shown in the table below.\r

Exampl e 2.3.3. Let us consider the subgroup G of PSL{2,11) generated by\r
the matrices:\r
9 0 \\ , / 9 10\r
6 5 ' = 0\r
a\r
If we consider the action of a on Pii we see that it corresponds to the permutation\r
(1,00,7,10,9) (2,3,5,6,4) (0) (8)\r
on the other hand, 6 corresponds to\r
(1,6,4,7,8) (2,10,9,5,0) (3) (oo).\r
We can label < a > = — {0,8} and < 6 > = = {3,cx3} and see that\r
G = Ag. Studying the action of on the set of pairs of points of P n , we see that\r
the pairs hxed by a and 6 belong to the same orbit, which is the sextuple of pairs\r
that characterizes G:\r
I {1,2} {5,7} {8,0} {6,10} {4,9} {3,oo} }.\r
And therefore those are the six subgroups isomorphic to C5 contained in G.\r
40

2.B. The Hecke group\r
In general, a Hecke group is a discrete subgroup of f5'Z,(2,R) that is\r
generated by the following two transformations:\r
% : z —> — and Z : z —> z + A\r
z\r
In a result due to Hecke [He], any group generated by % and Z as before is\r
discrete if and only if A > 2 or A = = 2 cos where M E N and M > 3. The\r
Hecke groups where A > 2, are Fuchsian groups of the second kind, with a limit set\r
that is nowhere dense in R, and they are of no interest to us. The case A = 2 gives\r
a Puchsian group of the hrst kind but with a non compact quotient, as for the case\r
A = An they are Fuchsian groups of the 6rst kind, and we will refer to them as\r
Every time we mention "Hecke group" in this work, we shall mean Hecke group of\r
the Erst kind. In particular, we see that\r
and for a > 4 the inclusion is strict.\r
In this work we will deal with which is the modular group F = f Z),\r
and the group where Ag is the golden ratio.\r
i + Vs\r
When considered in terms of their presentation, the groups iiZ"" are triangle\r
groups with signature [2, n, oo], where X is a representative for the elliptic elements\r
of order 2, Z is a parabohc element and\r
y = : z -\r
Z — Ar\r
is a representative for the elliptic elements of order M, thus there is one conjugate\r
class of subgroups of order n.\r
We can find a fundamental domain for which will be a hyperbolic triangle\r
in ZY with one or two of its vertices in = R = R U {oo}. A standard choice for\r
a fundamental region of is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices 0, and oo;\r
another choice is the hyperbolic triangle with vertices —an d oo.\r
41

In general, the description of the elements of -ff" cannot be explicitly done,\r
however it is possible to describe them for the cases M = 3, 4 and 6. We will cover\r
M = 3 in a later section while the other two cases are very similar to one another:\r
n = 4 we have A4 — \\/2\r
n = 6 we have Ag = \\/3.\r
We will now prove that a matrix M is an element of Tif"* where = 2(A; + 1)\r
and 77%^; = (A; + 1), (A; = 1,2) if M can be written in one of the following ways:\r
M,O \\ c y\r
where de((M) = 1 and o, 6, c, cf € Z.\r
It is easy to see that any matrix in jf"' ' must have this form. Any matrix in\r
is represented by a word in % and Z, and any word in % and Z with only one\r
% would be of the form\r
K „ = Z-ATZ' = 1\r
for a certain r, g E Z. We will prove that all words with an odd number of X in\r
them have the form of the matrix Mo while the words with an even number of %\r
have the form of Mg. We will proceed by induction and first assume that the result\r
is true for any word W) with Z or less % in it.\r
Take a word PK/+1 with Z + 1 appearances of %, we can express it as =\r
g-^Wi for certain r, s G Z and for a certain word Wi with I appearances of X.\r
By hypothesis, if Z is odd then\r
where a, 6, c, E Z and an easy calculation shows that corresponds to a\r
matrix of the form Mg. If / is even we choose W) from the set of matrices of Mg\r
and proceed in the same way.\r
As for the set of cusps, it is not known what the cusp set is for a general\r
although we know that the cusp set of f 5'_L(2, Z[An]) is Q(An) U {00} (which we\r
represent by Q(An)) and thus that of jif" must be a subset of Q(An). One of the\r
42

best results for this problem is due to Leutbecher [Leu2] who proved that for the\r
values M 6 {3,4,5,6,8,10,12} the cusp set of is:\r
U {oo}.\r
Therefore in the case n = 3, the cusp set is Q while for the case n = 5 its\r
cusp set is Q(\\/5), and in both ceises the cusp set is the whole held completed\r
with infinity. It turns out that these are the only two cases where the equahty\r
— Q(An) holds, since Wolfart [Wol] proved that it is false for any other\r
case except perhaps M = 9 and Seybold proved later that n = 9 is not possible either\r
[Ro].\r
The field Q(An) is a number held, that is, it is a hnite extension of Q, and\r
its degree is where is the Euler function. In fact it is the maximum real\r
subheld of the number held Q(e2n), where is the nth root of unity, and we can\r
easily calculate its degree since : Q(An)] = 2. The ring of algebraic integers\r
of the held Q(An) is Z[An] (see [Was]), that means that if a; 6 Q(An) is a solution\r
for\r
+ dra-l'-jC^ ^ + • • • + do = 0\r
where a, E Z, then z 6 Z[An]. And furthermore, given ?/ E Z[An] and d =\r
then ^ have the form\r
d— 1 I L \\ d—2\r
y — bd-l^n + bd-2^n + • • • + b,\r
where 6; G Z.\r
If we are to study the structure of the ideals of Z[An], it suffices to study\r
its prime ideals, since Z[Xn] is the integral ring of a number field, it is a Unique\r
Factorization Domain (UFD). We cam go even further, since for < 68 every Z[An]\r
is a PID (see [Was]) and every ideal in it is principal. Since we wiH only deal with\r
M = 3 and n = 5 that result covers our two chosen cases.\r
Given f a prime ideal of Z[An] (where n < 68) we will say that jVorm(f) = m\r
if m G Z is the smallest positive rational integer so that P | m. There is a general\r
definition of the of an ideal where the class number is diferent from 1, but\r
we will not need it here.\r
Our last concern is going to be the group of units of the rings Z[An], but in this\r
case we will only cover the cases we are going to use. For n = 3,5 the integers rings\r
43

are Z and Z\r
l-}-\\/5\r
2\r
respectively, while the group of units in the rings is {1, —1}\r
for the case n = 3, and is the cyclic group generated by for the case n = 5.\r
A standard feature of any Hecke group is that its cusp set can be represented\r
by finite continued fractions.\r
Notation We will use the notation to indicate a term inside a contin\u0002ued fractions expansion, and we will display the terms in a continued fractions\r
expansion ordered, between brackets and separated by commas to make clear the\r
non-commutative nature of this representation, so that\r
Go\r
ai\r

03 4-\r
CJ4\r
will be represented by\r

Theorem 2.B.I. Given H'^ a Hecke group, C is a cusp of i?" if and only if it\r
can be expressed as a Enite continued fraction of of the form:\r

where 0^6%.\r
Proo f i?" is generated by X and Z, so any element in H"- is a finite word in\r
these two letters. As any parabolic element of is conjugate to a power of\r
(that fixes 0), any cusp of jif" is the image of 0 by an element of Tif". Let us assume\r
that the cusp C is the image of 0 by the word defined by\r
PF =\r
where E Z.\r
It is easy to see that\r
= z + aA», =\r
- 1\r
and\r
-1\r
z -j- oAr\r

44

so that when we consider the representation of we get\r
— 1 - 1 - 1\r
aiAn_\r
' _0'2^n_ ? 1 _ ^ni^n 4" _\r
and we see that VF(0) is as in the hypothesis. To prove the converse it is enough\r
to reverse the argument so that the proof is Enished. O\r
Since Jif" is a free product of its generators, we can impose conditions on\r
E to make its expression in terms of % and Z unique, and therefore we can\r
as well consider the continued fraction representation for every cusp unique [Ro].\r
Exampl e 2.B.2. We will show how the previous theorem works. Let\r
89 + 107\\/5\r
38\r
be a cusp of 77^, an easy calculation shows that it can be expressed as\r
-1 -1\r
' _3Aj\r
and it is therefore the image of\r
Another interesting area for the study of Hecke groups are their subgroups, in\r
particular the special congruence subgroups. Given the group P5L(2,Z[A„]) and I\r
an ideal in Z[An], we can define the apeciaf con^n/ence of\r
for I as:\r
f Z[A»]) (7) = j ^ g ^ ^ ^ f ^i:(2, Z[A»]) | o = (f=l , 6 = c = 0 (mod 7)\r
f^i:(2,Z[A»])i(/) = ef^i,(2,Z[A»]) | a = (f = l, c = 0 (mod 7)\r
f^7:(2,Z[An])o(7) = j ( c ^ f^7:(2,Z[A»]) | c = 0 (mod 7)\r
45

We call PS'L(2, Z[A„])(/) the principal congruence subgroup of P5L(2,Z[A„])\r
for / . We can extend these deGnitions to Tif" and deEne the special congruence\r
subgroups of 77" as:\r
where the subscript * can be 0, 1 or omitted.\r
We will proceed to describe some relations satished by the special congruence\r
subgroups of f6'i}(2,Z[An]). That the principal congruence subgroup satisfy\r
f Z[A»])(7) < f ^i,(2, Z[A^])i(7)\r
is easy to see if we take the group epimorphism\r
T/,:P5'I,(2,Z[A^])i(7)—dehnedb y\r
where [6] denotes the class of 6 inside and calculate\r
The previous result is actually a particular caae of a more general one since\r
f6'i}(2,Z[An])(Z) is actually normal inside the group f5'i,(2,Z[An]) for which we\r
need to consider\r
« : P S L (2, given by 4- ( ^ ^ ^ )\r
where [x] is the class of a; in , it is clear that PSL{2,'L[\\n]){I) = Ker{^). We\r
have as well that\r
f Z[A»])i(7) < f Z[A»])o(Z).\r
This we can see if we consider the epimorphism\r
%:fg^(2,Z[A^])o(7)—^\r
where [a] is the class of a in and [/(Z[An]//) is the set of units of\r
Z[An]/7. We can check that jirer(%) = f5'i,(2,Z[An])i(/). It follows in a natural\r
way that the same happens to the special congruence subgroups of\r
(7) < (7) 0 (7) < 77" and 7f" (7) < 77"\r
46

Exampl e 2.B.3. The above inclusions are not necessarily strict, if we take\r
and the ideal in generated by (2), we can see that\r
As for the indices of the special congruence subgroups of for a given n, in\r
general they are not known. The indices of the subgroups of f5'Z,(2,Z[An]) (see\r
[Hur]) provide an upper bound, but there are examples where these bounds are\r
not attained.\r
1\r
[f 5'i:(2, Z[A,]) : f gz:(2, Z[A,])om] = j\r
[P^Z,(2,Z[A^]) : f^i:(2,Z[A^])(7)] = 1\r
^ \\ 7Vor77%(f)^\r
[P^i,(2,Z[A^])i(/) : f5'i;(2,Z[A»])(7)] = Norm(/)\r
where stands for the norm of the ideal 7, and f runs through the distinct\r
prime divisors of 7.\r
There are many cases where the indices of the special congruence subgroups\r
of 77", attain the upper bound provided by the indices of the special congruence\r
subgroups of f 5'7,(2, Z[An]), as it is shown in the following theorem by Prye [Pr]\r
Theorem 2.B.4. Let\r
i=l\r
be the prime factorization of an ideal 7 of Z[An] with (6n, 7) = 1. If n = 3 (that is,\r
for the modular group) let also be (5,7) = 1. Let 7* = 7nQ(A^) and let Arorm(7)\r
be the Aonn of 7 in Q(A^). Then\r
iH" : = 2-Norm(I'rU\r
with\r
^ 0 if there is % ^ such that 7^ D Q(An) = 7^ D Q(An)\r
0 if there is % such that = f (3i^(2,\r
- 1 otherwise\r
and P running through the prime divisors of 7*.\r

2.4. The modular group H\r
For the case where ri = 3, A3 = 1 and we get the most studied of all Hecke\r
groups, namely the modular group F\r
F = f^Z,(2,Z) =\r
a 6\r
c (f\r
E I a,6,c,dG Z\r
With presentation F = < %, Ys | = 1 > and signature [2,3, 00].\r
For a picture of a modular region (a fundamental region of the modular group)\r
see Fzp. ,9.^. below.\r
0 ^ 1\r
Propositio n 2.4.1. The orbit of 00 under the action of F is Q.\r
Proof Let ^ e Q be an irreducible fraction, as (o, c) = 1 we can 6nd d, 6 E Z\r
so that acf — 6c = 1, and therefore\r
a 6\r
c\r
e f ^2:(2, z )\r
if we call T : z — i t is clear that [r(oo) =\r
Corollary 2.4.2. The cusp set of F is Q and its action on its cusp set is\r
transitive.\r

prove the other two. In order to do so we will use the functions ^ and % defined in\r
section 2.B. in the context of the special congruence subgroups of f5'i,(2,Z[An]).\r
When n, = 3, r = f 5'iL(2, so we can use % to prove that\r

For any integer A^ of Z we will say that the congruence subgroups of F for #\r
are of level N. We know that F(A^) has no elliptic elements if AT > 2 so that if\r
we fill in the cusps of X = we get in X the structure of a compact Riemann\r
surface\r

special congruence subgroups of f5'i^(2,Z[An]) in section 2.B. is:\r

Once we have described the cusp set of it is natural to try to answer similar\r
questions to those solved for n = 3, like finding the index of the special congruence\r
subgroups of 77^ or the action of the principal congruence subgroup for the ideal\r
7, ^^(7 ) over the cusp set of The following explicit calculation of the index\r
can be found in [CLLT].\r

positive rational prime contained in 7.\r
We will prove a theorem for the action of 77^(7) on the cusp set of 77^ that\r
is similar to the one explained for n = 3. Before doing so we need to define the\r
canonical form of a cusp of 77^.\r
Let ^ E 0(^5) be a cusp of 77^, we can find a unique expression of ^ as a\r
continued fraction of As of the form:\r

where for technical reasons we will not allow any form of fraction simplification\r
within the last term of the expression.\r
If we apply this process to the continued fractions expansion of ^ in terms\r
of A5 aa defined in Theorem 2.5.1., what we get is a fraction (that should not be\r
reduced) whose numerator f and denominator Q Eire an expression in Oi and A5.\r

We say that J is the canonical form of the fraction ^ under A5. It is clear\r
that there is a Z G Z such that f and Q = Agm so that ^ The main\r
advantage of using the canonical form of a fraction is that it allows us to find a\r

Chapte r Thre e\r
Finite Geometries\r
The aim of this chapter is to introduce incidence structures, that will lead\r
to (hnite) geometries and designs. Among them we will pay special regard to\r
projective planes and biplanes, particularly to the structure of the Fano plane and\r
that of the first three biplanes, paying special attention to the biplane of order three\r
or 3-biplane.\r
Among other connections that will be explored in the next chapter, the Fano\r
plane and the 3-biplane are the Srst two examples of Hadamard designs. Most of\r
the information displayed here can be found in [HP] and [Po], as well as proofs\r
for most of the results in this chapter, unless otherwise stated.\r
3.1. Introduction\r
An or simply a is a pair of non-empty sets 7^\r
and £, which we shall call points set V and lines set C with an incidence relation\r
Is c V x jC consisting of a non-empty set of pairs (P, I) where P is a point and I a\r
line. We will assume that the structures have a finite number of points and lines,\r
that is, that they are structures.\r
If (P, Z) E ig, we say that P belongs to Z, that P and / are or that\r
(P, I) is an incidence pair. The usual name for lines in structures is blocks, but we\r
prefer lines since we will rapidly move into geometries.\r
We can represent the incidence relation Is of a finite structure S with m points\r
and n lines by a m x n matrix Ms that we call an incidence matrix of <S.\r
5 5

To construct an incidence matrix of S we need to index the points and lines\r
sets 7^ = /I = and de6ne Mg eis the matrix with coeScients\r
where i = 1,... ,m, j = 1,... ,n and:\r
1\r
0 otherwise.\r
is not uniquely determined, but it contains all the relevant information\r
about the structure (S. In fact, given Mg and two incidence matrices for the\r
same structure there are two permutation matrices (i.e. matrices so that in every\r
row and column all the coefficients are 0 except for one that is 1) A and 5" so that:\r
RMsS = Mg.\r
We will say that a finite structure is if for any two points f and\r
Q there is a sequence of incidence pairs of the form\r
[(p,o, (Pi.o . {-Pi.(i), (P2.h),... . w.;')]\r
that connects f and Q.\r
With the previous definition of structure there are some pathological cases that\r
we want to avoid:\r
- Two lines (resp. points) are if they are incident with the same set of\r
points (resp. lines), if we remove all repetitions (i.e. we get rid of aU repeated\r
elements of one kind but one), we say that we have recfucecf the structure. It is\r
clear that reducing the structure is equivalent to eliminating all repeated rows\r
and columns in the incidence matrix.\r
- We say that an element (point or line) is when it is in none or just\r
one pair of the incidence relation, and we say it is full when it is incident with\r
all the elements of the other type. We a structure if we remove\r
all isolated and full elements. On the other hand, we standardize an incidence\r
matrix when we remove all columns or rows that have either all coeScients\r
equal to zero, all coefficients but one equal to zero, or no coefEcients at all\r
equal to zero.\r
A structure is if it is reduced and standardized, we wiU caU\r
a connected totally reduced structure. This dehnition of geometry is\r
56

more restrictive than the usual one (that allows full and repeated elements) but we\r
are not interested in the anomalous cases. Although in the process of reducing or\r
standarizing a given structure <"""

A uniform geometry is called a If there are exactly A lines through\r
every ( points of a design, we say that we have a t — (f,A;,A) design, where is\r
the number of points of the design, and A; the number of points in each line. In\r
particular any ( — (t;, A;, A) design is regular. We will say that a design is sguore if\r
its incidence matrix is a square matrix, that is if there are as many lines as points\r
in the design, a square 2 — (i;, A:, A) design is called a design.\r
59

Theorem 3.1.5. In general, for a t — {v, k, X) design, if we call b the number\r
of lines in the design and r the number of lines through a point, the two following\r
equalities hold:\r
h — \\ v{v-l) ••• (w-t+1)\r
' ° .. (k-t+1)\r
• if t > 0 then bk = vr.\r
Proo f The proof is an easy counting exercise. Since every t-uple of points\r
defines A lines and from a given line we can get j ^-uples of points, the number\r
of lines is\r
k\r
t\r
The design is regular because by a similar argument the number of lines through\r
any given point is\r

Propositio n 3.1.6. In a symmetric design with parameters (v, k, A), we have\r

v =\r
A\r
Proo f For the proof we will fix a point P E V and consider all the flags of the\r
form (Q, I) where Q ^ P and P E I and we will count them in two different ways.\r
As there are r lines through f and each one contains A; points, we have r(A — 1)\r
Sags of that sort. On the other hand, there are u - 1 choices for Q and for every\r
choice there are A diEerent possibilities for Z yielding a total of A(t; — 1) Sags. Since\r
the design is symmetric f = 6 and therefore r = A;. O\r
We could also have proved Proposition 3.1.6 . as a Corollary to Theorem 3.1.5 .\r
where b = v and t = 2.\r
We will only deal with designs such that t = 2, that is, there is a fixed number\r
of lines A through every two points of the design. We will define the orcfer n, for\r
such a design as n = r — A where r is the number of lines through a point. There\r
is a general definition of order for a ( — (f, A;, A) design (where t > 2), but it is of\r
no interest for us here.\r
60

As designs are in particular geometries, the relations between a general de\u0002sign, its dual and its complement structure, follow easily from similar results about\r
structures and geometries. A more difficult question is that of the relation among\r
a ( — (?;, A;, A) design, its dual and its complement. Here we will only tackle that\r
question for square ( = 2 designs.\r
Propositio n 3.1.7. Given a symmetric design V with parameters (ii, A, A),\r
its dual is a symmetric design with the same parameters.\r
Proo f That is a design is easy to see since as D is regular (becase it is\r
symmetric), is a uniform geometry.\r
As D is symmetric, if we call 6 the number of lines and r the number of lines\r
through a point as in Theorem 3.1.5. following that theorem we get that 6 =\r
and r = A;. We still have to prove that every two lines of 7) intersect in precisely A\r
points, and we will use the incidence matrix for this part.\r
If we call the identity matrix of order f and a t; by matrix with all its\r
entries 1, we get that\r
Mj) • Afp = riy + X(Jv — ly)\r
where the element rfu on the right means that there are r lines trough each point\r
and the element A(Ju — A,) comes from the fact that any two points determine A\r
lines. It is easy to prove that\r
= (r - + (n - 1)A)\r
and since r > A > 0, Mp is an invertible matrix.\r
From there we get:\r
Mx> • • -Mp) — (-Md • • Mj) = rMx> + A ( • Mx> — Mx))\r
but\r
Ju ' — kjy — Jv — ' Jy\r
and since is non singular, we get that\r
• Mj) = fly + X{Jv ~ ly)\r
and therefore any two lines of D have precisely A points in common.\r
Theorem 3.1.8. Given a non trivial symmetric design V with parameters\r
(u, A;, A), its complement geometry is a symmetric design with the same order as D\r
and parameters (f, f — A:, f — 2A; + A).\r
61

Theore m 3.1.9. For a non trivial symmetric design of order n and parameters\r
, A;, A), we have that\r
4?i — 1 < f M + 1.\r
Proo f By Proposition 3.1.6. we have that:\r
k{k — 1) + A\r
v =\r
A\r
In this kind of design n = k — X{v = bhy symmetry, hence k = r by Theorem\r
3.1.5.) which yields:\r
. = "'"'''+ A + 2n.\r
If we consider the above expression as a function ii(A) where 1 < A < n(n — 1) (if\r
A > n(n — 1) then f (A) would be a rational number, which is impossible), we see\r
that it has a concave graph with a minimum at\r
AQ — 1^72(72 1)\r
and two maxima at\r
Ai = 1 and A2 = — 1).\r
The two natural numbers closest to Ao are (n — 1) and n, and we have that\r
?;(?%) = — 1) = 4n — 1\r
so t;(A) >471 — 1. On the other hand, for the two maxima values we get that\r
t;(l) = — n) = + n + 1\r
and therefore f (A) < + n + 1.\r
The two extreme cases of this theorem actually occur:\r
. For u = 4n — 1 we get that either the design or its complement have parameters\r
2 — (4A + 3,2A + 1, A). Any symmetric design with that set of parameters and\r
for any A is called a or simply a\r
. For II = + n + 1 we have that either the design or its complement is a\r
projective plane, as we shall see in the next section.\r
62

There is a limited amount of information regarding the existence of designs for a\r
given set of parameters ((, A;, A) or about the number of non equivalent desings for\r
one choice of parameters. The main result about non existence of square 2 — (t;, A;, A)\r
designs is (for a proof see [HP]):\r
Theorem 3.1.10. (Bruck-Ryser-Chowla ) If v, A:, A € Z satisfy\r
— 1)A = A;(A: — 1)\r
then for the existence of a symmetric (f, A;, A) design it is necessary that:\r
- If f is even then A: — A is a square.\r
If f is odd, then = (A; — A)^;^ + (—ha s a non-trivial solution in\r
integers a;, ^ and z.\r
The following corollary is very important when dealing with projective planes,\r
since it restricts the possible orders for them.\r
Corollary 3.1.11. If a symmetric design with A = 1 and order n exists, and\r
M = 1 (mod 4) or\r
n = 2 (mod 4)\r
then n can be expressed as a sum + 6^ where o, 6 E Z.\r
Proo f Since the design is symmetric and A = 1, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have\r
that\r
V = k{k — 1) + 1 = (n + l)n + 1.\r
Assume now n = 1 (mod 4) or n = 2 (mod 4), we then have = 3 (mod 4) and\r
therefore (—1) ^ = — 1 so that from the second statement in the previous theorem,\r
we have and then\r
"=4+ 4\r
a;"'\r
where n E Z. It is well known that an integer is the sum of two square\r
rationals if and only if it is the sum of two square integers. O\r
We can obtain similar results about the existence of %-designs of a given order\r
by using Hadamard matrices. A Hadamard matrix of order n is a square n by\r
n matrix H whose entries are either +1 or —1 and such that HH^ = nl. We\r
63

can define a generalized version of the permutation matrix that we have used when\r
dealing with incidence matrices, a is a square matrix\r
whose entries are ±1 or 0 and such that in each row and column all entries but one\r
are zero.\r
Theorem 3.1.12. If iJ is a Hadamard matrix of order n and i?, S are gener\u0002alized permutation matrices of order n, then H' = RHS is a Hadamard matrix of\r
order n. We will say that ^ and jif' are\r
It is clear that a class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order n is stable\r
under the action of the group of all row and column permutations and sign changes.\r
In fact, for every class of Hadamard equivalent matrices of order M we can choose\r
a matrix in the class such that all entries in the first row and column are 1 (which\r
is obviously not unique for a given class). We will call such a matrix a\r
The following result impose a restriction on the order of possible Hadameird\r
matrices:\r
Theorem 3.1.13. If is a Hadamard matrix of order n then n must satisfy\r
one of the following conditions:\r
^ n = 0 (mod 4).\r
As one would suspect, there is a strong relation between Hadamard matrices\r
and ^/-designs:\r
Theorem 3.1.14. Let H he & normalized Hadamard matrix of order n > 4. If\r
we delete the first row and column of and substitute all —1 entries by 0, we obtain\r
a matrix Mg, which is an incidence matrix for a square design with parameters\r
_ n, — 2 n — 4\r
that is, a "^-design. Conversely the incidence matrix of any Hadamard 2-design for\r
a given A becomes a normalized Hadamard matrix of order 4(A + 1) by the reverse\r
procedure.\r
64

Exampl e 3.1.15. H is a, normalized Hadamard matrix of order 8, if we apply\r
the method described above to it, we get Mjrano which is an incidence matrix for a\r
square design with parameters 2 — (7,3,1) that is in fact the Fano plane and that\r
will be described in the next section.\r

As we will see, the result in this example is in fact true for any normalized\r
Hadamard matrix of order 8. By Theorem 3.1.14. any such a matrix will yield\r
an incidence matrix for a symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, whose complement is a\r
symmetric 2 — (7,4,2) (see Theorem 3.1.8.). As there is only one symmetric 2 —\r
(7,4,2) design (the 2-biplane, see the proof of Proposition 3.3.5.), there is only one\r
symmetric 2 — (7,3,1) design, the Fano Plane.\r
3.2. Projective planes\r
A is a geometry that satishes the following three axioms:\r
• Two distinct points are contained in a unique line.\r
• Two distinct lines intersect in a unique point.\r
• There exist four points of which no three are incident with the same line.\r
Theorem 3.2.1. A finite projective plane is the same as a symmetric design\r
(t;, A, 1) with A; > 2.\r
Proo f Given V a symmetric [v, k, 1) design, since A = 1 it is true that any two\r
distinct points are contained in a unique line, and by Proposition 3.1.7. the second\r
projective plane axiom is also true. As A: > 2, by Proposition 3.1.6. we have that\r
V = k{k — 1) + 1 > 3{k — 1) > k.\r
As > A: we can choose three points f i , fg, ^3 not in the same line, and call\r
the line incident with and It is easy to see that\r
U ^{2,3} U ^{i,3}| = 3(A; — 1)\r
65

and so we can choose a fourth point of the design so that the third axiom is also\r
satisfied.\r
To prove the reverse, we need to show that a projective plane is uniform and\r
square. We can take a line Z and a point f 0 Z. By the first and second axiom,\r
there are as many hnes incident with f as there are points in / and we shall call\r
this number k. Let us take I' any line incident with P, by the third axiom we can\r
choose Q 0 r, f " , Q' so that no three of them are incident with the same line. If\r
we call r' the line defined by f and T' has A; points, and therefore there are A\r
lines incident with Q, which means that there are A: points in T and the geometry\r
is uniform. By Theorem 3.1.5. the geometry is also squgire, and by the hrst axiom\r
^ = 2 and A = 1. O\r
We define the orcfer of a hnite projective plane as A; — 1, that is the number a,\r
such that there are n, + 1 points in each line, and M + 1 hnes through each point.\r
Corollary 3.2.2. For any symmetric {v,k,X) design with A = 1, we have that\r
A; = n + 1 and ?; = M + 1 where n is the order of the design.\r
There is an easy way to construct hnite projective planes for which we shall\r
need the following well known result about hnite helds:\r
Theorem 3.2.3. If is a finite field then \\K\\ = where p is prime and\r
r E Z, r > 1. And for any p'" as before there is a unique finite field of order p"" that\r
we shall denote\r
If we take to be a finite field, and F to be a 3 dimensional vector space\r
over K, we can define P{K) to be the structure whose points are the 1-dimensional\r
subspaces of V, and whose lines are the 2-dimensional subspaces of V, while the\r
incidence structure is given by the subspace inclusion in V.\r
Propositio n 3.2.4. P{K) is a projective plane of type 2 — (n^+ n +1, n +1,1)\r
where n —\r
Proof To define a 1-dim subspace of V we need to consider any non zero vector\r
of y , and the fact that any 1-dim subspace contains — 1 such vectors. Following\r
that we see that P{K) contains + n + 1 points.\r
Given a 2-dim subspace, it contains — 1 non zero vectors, and reasoning as\r
before we get that it contains = n + 1 1-dim subspaces, that is, each line in\r
P{K) contains n + 1 points. Obviously any two different 1-dim subspaces generate\r
66

a 2-dim subspace. The incidence structure for the projective plane follows easily\r
from the properties of a vector space.\r
Corollary 3.2.5. There is at least one projective plane of order n for any\r
n = where p is prime and r £ Z, r > 1.\r
The two main results about the existence and non-existence of projective planes\r
are Corollary 3.1.11. and the corollary above. Little is known in general for any\r
other values of n and the smallest value for which we do not know whether there\r
is a projective plane with such order is n = 10. There are many projective planes\r
that are not constructed in the way mentioned above, for more information on the\r
topic see [HP],\r
Another important issue is the calculation of the automorphism group of a\r
projective plane. Although we do not know a general way of calculating automor\u0002phism groups for an arbitrary plane, we do know it for f (TiC) when |j^| = p'' and\r
p prime. What follows is the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, that\r
can be found in many standard books on projective geometry, we will only use what\r
apphes to hnite projective planes.\r

The smallest possible non-trivial finite projective plane is the Fano f ZaMe com\u0002posed by seven points and seven lines, so that there are three points in any fine,\r
and there are three lines going through any given point, that is, it is a 2 — (7,3,1)\r
design. It corresponds to f (22)- The Fano plane is a\r
which means that any two different points of it are indistinguishable, i.e. there is\r
an automorphism of the geometry carrying one point to the other.\r
The Fano plane is the only projective plane of order 2, and it is easy to see that\r
it has 21 bits. We wiU see that its full group of automorphisms has order 168 and\r
67

it is isomorphic to PSL{2,7). For the most traditional picture of the Fano plane\r
with its Eags labelled, see ^.,8.\r
Beside being related to Z2, the Pano plane is closely related to the Snite Eeld\r
Z7. In fact, if we consider the set of quadratic residues mod 7, that is, the set\r
{1,2,4} and let the transformation z —> z + 1 (mod 7) act on the set of triples\r
of Zy, the orbit of {1, 2, 4} by this action is:\r
{1,2,4} {2,3,5} {3,4,6} {4,5,0} {5,6,1} {6,0,2} {0,1,3}\r
and if we call each of these sets a line, and consider every element M 6 Zy as a point\r
of a structure, we can see that what we get is the incidence relation of the Fano\r
plane.\r

Since the Fano plane represents a highly symmetric hypergraph, it is only\r
natural to try to 6nd ways of embedding it as a conformal structure in a highly\r
symmetric way in a surface. The optimum way of doing this will be to find an\r
embedding that keeps both its symmetries and its combinatorial properties, while\r
corresponding to a smooth embedding into a surface.\r
If we try to embed it as a regular hypermap inside a Riemann surface, it\r
is knows that it can be done in two diSerent ways, as a (3,3,3) dessin in the\r
triangular torus [Wa] or as a (3,3,7) dessin inside Klein's quartic [Si4]. Other\r
embeddings of Snite geometries in Riemann surfaces as dessing are also discussed\r
in [Si4]. Embeddings of finite geometries as regular dessins into Riemann surfaces\r
68

are closely related to the existence of big subgroups inside the automorphism group\r
of the geometry.\r
Corollary 3.2.8. The automorphism group of the Fano plane is isomorphic\r
to:\r
f ^1,(2, 7)\r
which is the simple group of order 168.\r
Proof Immediate from Corollary 3.2.7. and the fact that (for a proof see for\r
example [Di])\r
fGi:(3,2 ) ^f^i;(2,7) .\r
3.3. Biplanes\r
A generalization of finite projective planes arises naturally when we allow two\r
lines to intersect in more than a point (respectively when we allow two points to\r
dehne more than one line), if A is the number of points that belong to two different\r
lines, we will call these generalization (6%- and (n- for the cases A = 2, 3).\r
So a is a symmetric geometry that satisfies the following two axioms:\r
- Two distinct points are contained in exactly two distinct lines.\r
- Two distinct lines intersect in exactly two distinct points.\r
Finite biplanes have been much less studied than standard projective planes,\r
and we only know 17 different examples of them [Po]. We will associate with every\r
biplane its order, which is the number n such that every line of it has n +2 points. As\r
far as we know nobody has tried to End smooth embeddings of biplanes in Riemann\r
surfaces before. The 17 known biplanes have orders in the set {1,2,3,4,7,9,11}.\r
By Theorem 3.1.10. there are no biplanes of orders {5,6,8}. The Erst example of a\r
biplane is a 2 — (4,3,2) design, which is a biplane of order 1. It is immediate to see\r
that there is only one possible incidence structure for such a biplane where every\r
line is determined by the only point not belonging to it. The biplane of order 1 has\r
= 12 Sags and can be embedded into the sphere, since we can see it as a regular\r
map of type (3,2,3) i.e. a tetrahedron. For two diSerent pictures of the biplane of\r
order 1 see ,9.J. We have already seen that its complement is not a geometry\r
in Example 3.1.2.\r
69

The second example of a biplane is a 2 — (7,4,2) design which corresponds to\r
biplanes of order 2. We will later see that there is only one possible incidence struc\u0002ture for biplanes of order 2 and 3 (see Theorem 3.3.3. and the proof of Proposition\r
3.3.5.), although that is not the case for biplanes of higher orders, as there Eire 3\r
biplanes of order 4 [Hus], and 4 biplanes of order 7 [MS].\r
The biplane of order 2 is the complement of the Fane plane, it has 7 points and\r
7 lines, but there are four points in each line making a total of 28 bits. Its group\r
of automorphisms is again f 5'Z,(2, 7) (see Proposition 3.1.4. or Proposition 3.3.5.)\r
and it is a 2 — (7,4, 2) design. For a picture of this biplane see .9.^. where the\r
thick circle is highlighted because it also meets the central vertex.\r
^.6". on (Ae pZone OMcZ oa o deggm m (/le gp/iere\r
Since there is no subgroup of f 5'i,(2,7) of index 6, it is not possible to embed\r
this structure as a regular hypermap or hypergraph into a Riemann surface with\r
PSL{2, 7) as its automorphisms group. Nevertheless, we will show an alternative\r
representation of its incidence structure into Klein's Riemann surface in chapter\r
four.\r
The biplane we are most interested in is the biplane of order 3, which has\r
11 points and 11 lines, and Eve points in each line making a total of 55 bits. Its\r
full group of automorphisms has order 660 and is isomorphic to f5'i^(2,11). Since\r
it is the only biplane of order three, we will refer to it as the 3-biplane. It is a\r
2 - (11,5,2) design.\r
The 3-biplane is related to the quadratic residue classes of Z n in precisely\r
the same way as the Fano plane with Zy. That is, if we take the set of quadratic\r
residues mod 11, A = {1,3,4,5,9} and construct eleven sets of five elements by\r
70

considering the action oi 4> •. z i—> z + 1 (mod 11), we can regard the elements\r
n G Zii as points of the 3-biplane where the lines are represented by where\r
r e Zii.\r
To calculate automorphism groups of biplanes we need to introduce Hussain\r
graphs [Hus]. We will see their importance when dealing with the automorphism\r
group of the 3-biplane. A is a graph associated to any line Z in a\r
biplane B and any point Q 0 Z. The vertices of the graph are those of the line Z,\r
and two vertices f , f G Z are joined by an edge of the Hussain graph if and only if\r
there is a line of the biplane through P, P' and Q.\r

We will use the notation Z-Hussain set (or simply Z-H) to refer to the set of\r
Hussain graphs associated with the line I and [Q, /]-Hussain graph (or [Q, Z]-H) to\r
71

refer to a particular graph in the /-Hussain set. The importance of Hussain graphs\r
is that a line Z E B and the whole set of Z-Hussain graphs completely determine the\r
biplane B, for a proof see Theorem 3.34 in [HP].\r
We will say that the Hnssain graphs [Q,Z]-H and [Q%Z']-H are isomorphic, if\r
they are isomorphic as graphs. Two Z-Hussain sets Z-H and Z'-H are isomorphic if\r
there is a bijection from the point set of Z-H to the point set of Z'-H that induces\r
isomorphisms between their graphs.\r
Propositio n 3.3.1. Given a biplane B and a line I G B any two /-Hussain\r
graphs share exactly two edges and these two edges do not share a vertex. Further\u0002more, every Hussain graph is a divalent graph.\r
Proo f Let us choose two points Q', Q ^ L since 5 is a biplane, there are two\r
lines through Q and Q' that we will call Zi and Z2. Four new points appear when\r
we consider the intersections Zi n Z = {^1,^2}, Z2 H Z = where ^ if\r
% ^ J, since otherwise Zi and Z2 will have more than two points in common.\r
It is immediate to see now that fif z and ^3^4 are two shared edges by [Q, Z]-H\r
and Z]-H and that they do not share a vertex. If there were a third common\r
edge, that will mean that there is a third line through Q and Q' different from Zi\r
and Z2, in contradiction to the fact that B is a biplane.\r
Given f any vertex in [Q,Z]-H, there are only two hnes going through f and\r
Q and each one deSnes an edge of f , therefore any vertex has only two edges and\r
the graph is divalent.\r
Corollary 3.3.2. A [Q, Z]-Hussain graph is a disjoint union of polygons whose\r
vertices are the points of Z.\r
Proo f Immediate since the graph is divalent.\r
Theorem 3.3.3. Two biplanes B and B' are isomorphic if and only if for any\r
line Z E B there is a line Z' E such that the Z-Hussain set is isomorphic to the\r
/'-Hussain set.\r
Proo f Take / G 5 to be a line, and (j) : V —>- V the bijection between the\r
point sets induced by the isomorphism.\r
We will call Z' = (^(Z) and assume Q a point of B and Q 0 Z. Let us call\r
Q' = a]:id choose E Z so that the edge ^1^2 is in [Q,Z]-H. That means\r
that there is a third line h in B so that {Pi,P2,Q) E Zi, which in turns mean\r
72

that are points of the set that is a hne in B', since is\r
an isomorphism. Therefore the edge is in and the graphs are\r
isomorphic.\r
Let us assume now that there are two sets Z-H and I'-Yi that are isomorphic\r
and that ^ : Z-H —> Z'-H is the bijection between the point sets of Z and Z' that\r
defines the isomorphism, so we have aheady dehned the images of any point in Z.\r
Take Q 0 Z a point of B, ^ takes [Q, Z]-H to a graph in Z'-H that we call [Q', Z']-H,\r
so that we can define ^(Q) = Q' and therefore we have extended the definition of ^\r
to a bijection of the whole point set of B. All we need to prove is that it preserves\r
the incidence structure.\r
That takes lines to lines is clear, since given a line Zi in B diSerent from Z,\r
we know that Zi n Z = {^1,^2} and taking Q E Zi and Q 0 Z, as [Q,Z]-H goes to\r
[Q%Z']-H, there must be a line Z^ through and diSerent from Z', and\r
so we call i/'(Zi) = Z^. We have then a bijection of the point set that preserves the\r
lines and the incidence relation.\r
Corollary 3.3.4. Given B and B' two biplanes, and lines I G B and V G i?',\r
there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of isomorphisms : jB —\r
such that (^(Z) = Z' and the set of isomorphisms of Hussain sets taking Z-H to Z'-H.\r

Proo f Let us call Bi, B2 and B3 the biplanes of order 1, 2 and 3. As\r

73

we see that the orientation preserving and orientation reversing symmetries of the\r
tetrahedron are an automorphism of Bi, therefore = ^'4.\r
For B2 we use the fact that B2 is the complement of the Fano plane, and\r
Proposition 3.1.4. In that way Aut{B2) = Aut{Fano) = PSL{2,7). We could as\r
well have calculated ^1/^(^2) using its set of Z-H graphs, if we had done so we would\r
have seen that ther is only one way of drawing an Z-H set (see for a 2\r
biplane, and therefore by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one biplane of order 2.\r
Finally for ^ 3 we need to consider its /-Hussain graphs. A divalent graph on\r
five points must be a pentagon, and there are only Ave ways of drawing a divalent\r
graph on five vertices so that it shares exactly two non consecutive edges with the\r
pentagon. The six elements of any Z-Hussain graph of B3 can be seen in f g.\r
Since there is only one way of representing an Z-H set, all the Z-Hussain graphs\r
are isomorphic, (and hence, by Proposition 3.3.3. there is only one possible biplane\r
of order three) and there are automorphisms of B3 taking any line to any other\r
line, i.e. the automorphism group is transitive in the line set, and therefore in the\r
set of Z-H sets. Furthermore, we will see that the group of automorphism of an Z-H\r
set is isomorphic to A5:\r
It must be a subgroup of ^'5 but it does not contain any transpositions or\r
4-cycles, since the action of both transpositions and 4-cycles always Sx two consec\u0002utive edges of the pentagon, therefore it is a subgroup of A5. If we consider the\r
action of a 3-cycle we see that all of them are automorphisms of the set of Z-Hussain\r
graphs, so the stabiliser of any Z-H set is in fact ^^5. As there are 11 lines in B3 and\r
the action is transitive, \\Aut{B3) \\ = 660.\r
We will now show that Aut{Bz) is simple, and since there is only one simple\r
group of order 660, that will prove that Aut{Bs) = PSL{2,11).\r
Take Z a line of B3, as the automorphism group of the Z-H set is isomorphic to\r
the alternating group A5, by Corollary 3.3.4. we get that\r
StabiV) = A^.\r
Furthermore, since ^^((Bs) is transitive on the set of lines, aU the stabihzers are\r
conjugate and ^fa6(Z) ^^1/^(^3) for any Z E /Zg,.\r
Let us assume that G = C n and Go^^^(53). For this to happen there must\r
be only one 11-Sylow subgroup in ^^((Bs). Since any two lines Z, Z' share two\r

on the other hand, given Z and Z' two hnes, there are precisely three other lines Zj\r

As any element of of order diSFerent from 11 belongs to a line stabilizer,\r
we can count all elements of order different to 11 by using the previous facts, and\r
we get\r

There are a number of reasons that justify the study of the biplane of order\r
three: the biplane provides a geometrical model for the action of PSL{2,11) in\r
the same way as the icosahedron and the Fano plane are models for PSL{2,5)\r
and f 6'Z,(2,7) respectively, therefore throwing some hght into the structure of the\r
group. As a result of this similarity it is possible to find embeddings for the trun\u0002cated icosahedron in a Riemann surface (using the same idea that allows us to\r
embed a truncated cube in Klein's Riemann surface). Finally, both the combinato\u0002rial structure of the 3-biplane and that of the vertices of the truncated icosahedron\r
correspond to the combinatorial structure of the cusps of certain congruence sub\u0002groups of the Hecke group Some of the ideas developed in this work were found\r
in [KG] ,\r

Chapte r Four\r
Embedding of finite Geometries\r
In this chapter we will explore several embeddings of the Fano plane and the\r
3-biplane inside a Riemann surface, together with other geometric structures that\r
are related to them, such as the truncated cube and the truncated icosahedron.\r
The Fano plane can be embedded as a regular hypermap in the torus and in Klein's\r
quartic. These are the only embeddings of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap\r
in a Riemann surface.\r
We will also discuss two diSFerent kind of embeddings of the 3-biplane:\r
- as a regular hypermap inside a Riemann surface, there are two possibilities,\r
inside a surface of genus ^ = 12 and a surface of genus p = 15.\r
- as a bipartite graph, there are three possibilities, inside a surface with genus\r
^ = 70, a surface with genus g — 125 and a surface with genus p = 180 We will\r
only cover the first two cases in this work.\r
Each of the two embeddings of the 3-biplane as a graph that we are going to\r
study here generalizes different aspects of the Fano plane embeddings mentioned\r
above. Using them we will explore some interesting relationships among the groups\r
_P5'-L(2,])) where E {5, 7, 11}.\r

4.A. The Fano plane as a dessin\r
Since we know that the Fano plane has 21 bits, in order to embed it as a regular\r
hypermap, we need to find an epimorphism from a triangle group A = [Z, m, n] into\r
a group of order 21 such that its kernel is torsion free. The torsion free kernel\r
condition together with the fact that the Fano plane has no automorphism of order\r
21 forces {f, C {3, 7}.\r
On the other hand, we have already seen in chapter two that there are only\r
two non-isomorphic groups of order 21, one of them is the cyclic group C21, and the\r
other one is the semidirect product C? x C3 which we call G21 and that is dehned\r
by the presentation:\r
< e , / I = e/e- = 1 >\r
where we will assume u = 2 without loss of generality.\r
It is clear that there is no surface kernel epimorphism from the triangle group\r
A = Ti] (where {/, m, G {3, 7}) into C21 since there should be an element\r
in A of order 21, which contradicts the assumptions, so we only need to consider\r
G21 as the image of the epimorphism. Since C7 < G21, there is only one subgroup\r
of order 7 in G21, and thus there are only two possible triangle groups for the\r
epimorphism, either [3,3,3] or [3,3, 7]. We will see that both of them produce an\r
embedding of the Fano plane.\r
4.1. The Fano plane in the torus\r
This embedding was found by Walsh in 1975 [Wa] and corresponds to a regular\r
hypermap on a torus. It is related to the toroidal embedding of the complete graph\r
jiTy. We start by getting a presentation for [3, 3,3] given by:\r
< 0 , 6, c I = a6c = 1 >\r
where we can dehne the epimorphism (^ : [3,3,3] —G2 1 by ((921 presented as\r
above):\r
<^(a) = e (^(6) = <^(c) =\r
and using Riemann-Hurwitz formula it is easy to see that A!'er((^) has signature\r
(1; ). It is therefore a torsion free group and corresponds to a torus that we\r
77

shall call T. For a picture of a Walsh representation of the embedding see Fig. 4-1-\r
where the torus is marked with the thin continuous line.\r
It is easy to calculate the modulus of this torus, which is r = The auto\u0002morphism group of any regular map Ai on the torus is hnite and described\r
in [CM], while the automorphism group of any torus T is continuous and\r
hence inhnite. If we calculate for this torus, it turns out that is\r
isomorphic to the groups quotient where ^ is the subgroup of generated\r
by the transformations:\r

Fig. 4-i- Walsh embedding of the Fano plane\r
4.2. The Fano plane in Klein's quartic\r
This embedding was fouud by D. Singerman [Si4] in 1986. It corresponds\r
to an embedding of the Fano plane as a regular hypermap of type (3,3, 7) into a\r
Riemann surface with automorphism group isomorphic to the automorphism group\r
of the Fano Plane. It is therefore an embedding into a highly symmetric surface.\r
As before we will assume that the presentation of [3,3,7] and that of G21 are\r
respectively:\r
< a, 6, c I = 06c = 1 > < e, / I = / ^ = = 1 >\r
78

Our starting point is an epimorphism 4> '• [3, 3, 7] —G2 1 defined by\r
= e (^(6) = (^(c) =\r
and by Riemann-Hurwitz formula we see that the signature of jirer(<^) is (3; ),\r
we will call ^"^=3 the Riemann surface uniformized by\r
[3,3,7] is not a maximal triangle group, since it can be embedded into [2,3,7],\r
which is maximal [Si2], with index 8. If we consider a presentation for [2,3,7] of\r
the form\r
< A, B,C j A'^ = = ABC = 1 >\r
one of the possible set of equations (there are eight ways of doing the embedding)\r
for the embedding z : [3,3,7] —[2,3,7 ] is :\r
z(c) = ^C.4\r
where we can check that z(o6c) = = 1.\r
In order to calculate the automorphism group of ^"^=3 we need to End the\r
normalizer of 7irer(<^) inside f 6'i/(2, R). We will show that < [2,3,7], and\r
since [2,3, 7] is a maximal triangle group (see [Si2]), we will have proved that it is\r
the normahzer of A^er((^). That fact will prove that ^g=3 is Klein's quartic.\r

obtain a geometric representation of a Walsh double of a hypermap by taking its\r
Walsh representation and painting all vertices black, the bipartite map we get is a\r
Walsh double of the original hypermap.\r
4.6. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=i5\r
This embedding appears when one consider the triangle group [5,5,11] with\r
presentation\r
< o, 6, c I = a6c = 1 >\r
and the epimorphism : [5, 5,11] —G5 5 given by:\r
e <^(6) = e / <^(c) = /.\r
89

Using Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we see that the underlying Riemann surface\r
has genus ^ — 15 and we get the following group diagram:\r
[5,5,11] G55\r
T5 T5\r
(0;[ll5]) ^ Cn\r
^11 %11\r
A'er(i;6) > {1}\r
As in the previous case [5,5,11] is not a majcimal triangle group [Si2], and is\r
not contained in any other triangle group except:\r
[5,5,11] < [2,5,22].\r
We will prove nevertheless that = 55.\r
Using the same ideas as before, we suppose there is a torsion free kernel epi\u0002morphism"""

[[equations]]
latex = """
onto PSL(2,11) so that its kernel has index 660 and is torsion free. The\r
torsion free kernel condition limits the choice of periods for the triangle group to\r
the set {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11}. We need to impose a further condition: that there is a\r
subgroup A' < A with [A : A'] = 12 and signature\r
A = < g, [li, I21 ^3]\r
91

that is, three finite periods {U ^ 0) such that the restriction is an epimorphism\r
onto G55. This implies that A' has one of the following signatures:\r
= or A' = (g;[5,5,5])\r
which implies that there is at least a period of order multiple of 5 in A, using the\r
condition that limits the choice of periods in A, we can eissume that A = [5,\r
Since the index of A' in A is 12, we have that 12//(A) = //(A'), that is:\r
5 55 \\5m n\r
where m , » E {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11} and ^ E N. Out of the set of hyperbolic triangle\r
groups that could be candidates for A, we can see that only [2,5,11], [3,5,11] and\r
[5,6,11] satisfy all the conditions, and therefore are the only ones that might allow\r
an embedding of the kind described above.\r
In the first case ([2,5,11]), which seems to be the most interesting, the embed\u0002ding will be into a Riemann surface of genus p = 70. In that case we will be able\r
to extend the 3-biplane structure to the cusp set of a congruence subgroup of the\r
Hecke group\r
In the second case the underlying surface has genus p = 125, while in the leist\r
case A' has signature (3; [5,5,11]) and the underlying surface has genus p = 180. In\r
all three cases the bipartite graph has type (5,5,11) meaning that it is invariant by\r
rotations of order eleven around its "face" centres, or rotations of order 6ve around\r
its vertices. We will only cover the Erst two cases as the third one does not show\r
any interesting properties not covered by the other two cases.\r
4.7. Embedding the 3-biplane inside Rg=70\r
In this section we will explain the embedding of the 3-biplane that most closely\r
resembles that of the Fano plane in Klein's quartic. We start with the triangle group\r
[2, 5,11] with the following presentation:\r
< A, B, C I = A BC = 1 >\r

To find the structure of the bipartite graph on the surface we need to consider\r
one set of 22 points that will correspond to the vertices of the bipartite graph, and\r
another one of 55 points that correspond to edge centres (bits).\r
We will call the image of the embedding of the group Ggg into the automor\u0002phism group of ^g=7o- k chapter two we have seen that there are twelve diSerent\r
subgroups of order 11 in f 6'Z,(2,11). If we consider them as subgroups of the au\u0002tomorphism group of J?g=7o, we can see that each subgroup C n fixes five points on\r
93

the surface, and no two subgroups Hx the same point, so we have 60 distinguished\r
points on the surface. If we remove from this set the five points fixed by the action\r
of jif (i.e. the five points hxed by C^i), we obtain a collection of 55 points that are\r
transitively permuted by the action of ^ and that corresponds to the bits of the\r
embedded graph.\r
The remaining 22 points arise naturally when we consider the action of the\r
order five subgroups of 77. There are 11 such subgroups, each one Axes two points\r
on the surface, and therefore we have found the 22 points we needed. The choice of\r
colour is arbitrary, we need to hx one of the C5, for example C^'° , and paint one\r
of its fix points white, the other black. If we let acts on this pair of coloured\r
points, we will get the colouring for the remaining.\r
Since there are 12 diSerent embeddings of G55 in f5'i,(2,ll), there are 12\r
ways of embedding the bipartite graph (not considering swapping the colours of the\r
vertices), but all of them are conjugate by an automorphism of the surface.\r
4.8. Embedding the 3-biplane inside j%g=i25\r

played either by (4 + \\/5) or (4 — \\/5), the reason for this is that (11), which would\r
be the natural choice, is not longer a prime ideal in Z[A5] since it can be factorized\r
as the product of the previously mentioned ideals. It is trivial to see that ^ extends\r
easily to an epimorphism onto f 5'i,(2,11) as the following diagram shows.\r

We have seen in Proposition 2.5.6. that the cusp set of j7"(4 — VS) in the\r
upper half-plane can be described in terms of fractions of Q(\\/5) in their canonical\r
form. We will now label the cusps so that we can obtain a picture of the 3-biplane\r
embedding associated to the action of Ggg in the cusp set.\r
96

We win represent a fraction in its canonical form ^ G Q(\\/5) by the coordinates\r
(a, 6) where o, 6 G {0, 1, ... , 10}, if and only if:\r
f mod(4 — \\/5)\r
and\r
Q = ±6 mod(4 — \\/5)\r
Using that notation we get the incidence diagram in where darker\r
pawns represent vertices, lighter pawns represent edges and two points with the\r
same coordinates are identiGed.\r
4.10. Embeddings related to PSL{2,11)\r
In this section we will describe other geometrical structures that can be de\u0002scribed in terms of embeddings into and we will see a geometrical action\r
of f 11) on eleven objects. As we have seen in the previous section, we can\r
consider the embeddings as lying on or Eis displayed in the cusp set of\r
where\r
7 — (4 + \\/5) or 7 = (4 — \\/5).\r
The biggest proper subgroup of f 5'Z,(2,11) has order 60 and as we have seen,\r
it is isomorphic to f5'i,(2,5). We have already mentioned that there are 22 of\r
them into two conjugacy classes. They can be seen as the symmetry group of\r
the icosahedron, in fact, if we take the 60 points Bxed by elements of order 11 on\r
^g=70, we will see that they correspond to the vertices of a truncated icosahedron\r
(a football).\r
Let us consider any of the possible embeddings of ^4^ into f 6'Z}(2,11), there\r
are six subgroups of order 5 inside it, and each Cg Exes two points on the surface of\r
-Rg=7o when we see them as subgroups of its automorphism group. Each pair of fixed\r
points by a Cg can be seen as a diagonal of the (truncated) icosahedron embedded\r
on the surface. Every point in that pan- is the centre of an hyperbolic equilateral\r
pentagon, whose vertices are points fixed by elements of order 11 and in that manner\r
we obtain the 12 pentagonal faces of the truncated icosahedron on the surface\r
^g=70- For the hexagonal faces we can proceed in any of two ways: we can study\r
the action of the subgroups of order 3 on the set of C5, or consider the action of the\r
subgroups of order two on the surface, each subgroup of order two hxes two points\r
on the surface that correspond to edge centres of hexagonal edges of the truncated\r
icosahedron. With some work and a fair amount of calculation it is possible to\r
97

obtain a picture for the truncated icosahedron inside Ag-70, although given the big\r
genus of the surface and the low order of the highest order automorphism of the\r
surface, it shows as much as it conceals and so we will not display it here.\r
There are twenty two embeddings of a truncated icosahedron inside Ag=7o, dis\u0002tributed into two conjugacy classes, although orientation reversing automorphisms\r
of the surface will take one class onto the other. We will hnish this section by\r
showing a model for a geometric action of f 5'Z(2,11) on eleven points that is re\u0002lated to a model for the 3-triplane inside _Rg=7o (The definition of a triplane follows\r
naturally as a generalization of the one for a biplane).\r
The geometric action of f 11) on eleven objects is related to the combi\u0002natorial objects that are stabilized by A5 < f ^2/(2,11) and that can be embedded\r
into Ag=7o, so the truncated icosahedron is the obvious choice for it. If we consider\r
the eleven truncated icosahedra inside a conjugacy class, each one is linked to one\r
embedding of /Is inside a conjugacy class, and so the algebraic action of f 5'i,(2,11)\r
on the A5 of one class is analogous to its geometric action on the embedding of the\r
truncated icosahedron corresponding to that A5.\r
Following the same ideas displayed in the sections regarding the Fano plane,\r
we can consider the diagonals of each embedding of a truncated icosahedron as\r
bits of a combinatorial structure, and we can label them using the labelling for the\r
subgroup isomorphic to C5 in f5'i^(2,ll) whose pull-back into A'u((Eg=7o) &xes\r
that diagonal. If we do so, we can take the icosahedrons in one conjugacy class\r
as "lines" of an incidence structure (CZoss iL in the table in chapter 2) and the\r
icosahedrons in the other conjugacy class as "points" (CZasg f ). If we check the\r
resulting incidence structure, we see that we obtained a model for the 3-triplane,\r
that is, the complement geometry of the 3-biplane inside ^^=70-\r
4.11. Another example of a graph embedding\r
In this section we will describe an embedding of the Fano plane into a surface of\r
genus ^ = 24 that we will call Ag=24. We wiU embed the Fano plane as a conformal\r
graph in the same way as we have done with the 3-biplane. This is the only possible\r
rigid embedding of the Fano plane as a bipartite graph with non simply connected\r
faces into a surface with automorphism group isomorphic to _P5'iy(2,7).\r
