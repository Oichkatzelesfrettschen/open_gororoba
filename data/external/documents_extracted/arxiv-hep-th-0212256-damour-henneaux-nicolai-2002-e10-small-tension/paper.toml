Abstract\r
It is shown in detail that the dynamics of the Einstein-dilaton-p\u0002form system in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity can be asymp\u0002totically described, at a generic spatial point, as a billiard motion in a\r
region of Lobachevskii space (realized as an hyperboloid in the space\r
of logarithmic scale factors). This is done within the Hamiltonian for\u0002malism, and for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions D ≥ 4.\r
A key rˆole in the derivation is played by the Iwasawa decomposition\r
of the spatial metric, and by the fact that the off-diagonal degrees\r
of freedom, as well as the p-form degrees of freedom, get “asymp\u0002totically frozen” in this description. For those models admitting a\r
Kac-Moody theoretic interpretation of the billiard dynamics we out\u0002line how to set up an asymptotically equivalent description in terms\r
of a one-dimensional non-linear σ-model formally invariant under the\r
corresponding Kac-Moody group.

1 Introduction\r
1.1 BKL analysis in spacetime dimension D = 4\r
The non-linearities of the Einstein equations are notably known to prevent\r
the construction of an exact general solution. Only peculiar solutions, corre\u0002sponding to idealized situations, have been explicitly derived. The singularity\r
theorems of [48] predict the generic appearance of spacetime singularities un\u0002der certain conditions, but do not provide a detailed description of how the\r
spacetime becomes singular. From this perspective, the work of Belinskii,\r
Khalatnikov and Lifshitz [6, 8], also known as “BKL”, is quite remarkable as\r
it gives a description of the generic asymptotic behaviour of the gravitational\r
field in four spacetime dimensions in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity.\r
As argued by these authors, near the singularity the spatial points essentially\r
decouple, in the sense that the dynamical evolution of the spatial metric at\r
each spatial point is asymptotically governed by a set of second-order, non\u0002linear ordinary differential equations with respect to time.\r
These differential equations are the same, at each spatial point, as those\r
that arise in some spatially homogeneous cosmological models, which there\u0002fore provide valuable insight into the qualitative features of the general so\u0002lution. In the vacuum case, the spatially homogeneous models that capture\r
the behaviour of the general solution are of Bianchi type IX or VIII (with\r
homogeneity groups SU(2) or SL(2, R)). The asymptotic evolution of the\r
metric can then be pictured as an infinite sequence of “oscillations” of the\r
scale factors along independent spatial directions [6, 8]. This regime is called\r
“oscillatory”, or “of mixmaster type” [82], or also “chaotic” because it ex\u0002hibits strong chaotic features [77, 16]. The coupling to matter fields does not\r
change the picture, except if one includes a massless scalar field (equivalent\r
to a perfect fluid with “stiff” equation of state p = ρ), in which case the\r
chaotic evolution is replaced by a monotonic power law evolution of the scale\r
factors [5, 2], which mimicks the Kasner solution at each spatial point and is\r
therefore called “Kasner-like”. In this case the spatially homogeneous model\r
that captures the behaviour of the general solution is the Bianchi I model\r
(with the abelian group of translations in R\r
3 as homogeneity group).\r

1.2 BKL analysis in spacetime dimensions D > 4\r
The extension of the BKL analysis to higher dimensions was addressed within\r
the context of pure gravity (with no symmetry assumption) in [33, 32], where\r
it was shown that the general BKL approach remains valid: spatial points\r
decouple as one approaches a spacelike singularity, i.e., the dynamical evolu\u0002tion at each spatial point of the scale factors is again governed by ordinary\r
differential equations. The main result of [33, 32], was that, while the general\r
behaviour of solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations remains oscillatory\r
for spacetime dimensions D ≤ 10, it ceases to be so for spacetime dimensions\r
D ≥ 11, where it becomes Kasner-like. Let us also note that, just as in four\r
spacetime dimensions, the coupling to a massless scalar field suppresses the\r
chaotic behaviour in any number of spacetime dimensions and makes the\r
solution monotonic (see, e.g., [29]).\r
The authors of [33] did not consider the inclusion of massless p-forms,\r
which are part of the low energy bosonic sector of superstring/M-theory mod\u0002els. This task was undertaken in [24, 25], with the finding that these p-forms\r
play a crucial role and can reinstate chaos when it is otherwise suppressed.\r
In particular, even though pure gravity is non-chaotic in eleven spacetime\r
dimensions, the 3-form of D = 11 supergravity renders the system chaotic.\r
Similarly, the bosonic sectors of all D = 10 supergravities related to string\r
models define chaotic dynamical systems, thanks again to the p-forms, and\r
in spite of the presence of a massless scalar dilaton. It is remarkable and sig\u0002nificant that the (maximally supersymmetric) candidate models for a unified\r
description of the fundamental forces not only have difficulties accomodating\r
de Sitter-type spacetimes in any straightforward fashion [45, 80], but fur\u0002thermore, and without exception, exhibit BKL chaos as one approaches the\r
initial singularity.\r
1.3 Billiard description of BKL behaviour\r
An efficient way to grasp the asymptotic behaviour of the fields as one ap\u0002proaches a spacelike singularity is based on the qualitative Hamiltonian meth\u0002ods initiated by Misner [83] in the context of the Bianchi IX models (in four\r
spacetime dimensions). The Hamiltonian approach naturally leads to a bil\u0002liard description of the asymptotic evolution, in which the logarithms of the\r
spatial scale factors define (after projecting out the dynamics of the overall\r
volume factor) a geodesic motion in a region of the Lobachevskii plane H2,\r
2

interrupted by geometric reflections against the walls bounding this region\r
[17, 84]. Chaos follows from the fact that the Bianchi IX billiard has finite\r
volume1.\r
As pointed out in [71, 73, 56, 57, 26] this useful billiard description is quite\r
general and can be extended to higher spacetime dimensions, with p-forms\r
and dilaton. If d ≡ D−1 is the number of spatial dimensions, and if there are\r
n dilatons, the billiard is a region of hyperbolic space Hd+n−1, each dilaton\r
being equivalent, in the Hamiltonian, to the logarithm of a new scale factor.\r
Besides the dimension of the hyperbolic billiard, the other ingredients that\r
enter its definition are the walls that bound it. These walls can be of different\r
types [24, 26]: symmetry walls related to the off-diagonal components of the\r
spatial metric, gravitational walls related to the spatial curvature, and p\u0002form walls (electric and magnetic) arising from the p-form energy-density.\r
All these walls are hyperplanar. The billiard is a convex polyhedron with\r
finitely many vertices, some of which are at infinity. In many important\r
cases, the billiard can be identified with the Weyl chamber of a Kac-Moody\r
algebra, and the reflections against the billiard walls with the fundamental\r
Weyl reflections [26, 27, 23]. This suggests deep connections with infinite\r
symmetries.\r
The main purpose of this paper is to provide a self-contained derivation\r
of the billiard picture, in the general context of inhomogeneous solutions in\r
D dimensions, with dilaton and p-form gauge fields. In particular, we shall\r
present a detailed derivation of the general results, announced and used in\r
Ref. [24, 26], on the form of the various possible walls. For that purpose,\r
we shall rely on the Iwasawa decomposition (see e.g. [49]) of the spatial\r
metric. This provides an efficient derivation of the symmetry walls in any\r
number of spacetime dimensions, which we obtain by working out explicitly\r
the Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics in the “BKL limit” or “small\r
volume limit”.\r
The present work is exclusively concerned with properties of solutions of\r
Einstein’s equations and their generalizations in the vicinity of a spacelike\r
singularity. Accordingly, our treatment does not apply to timelike singular\u0002ities, for which no analog of causal decoupling exists (the situation may be\r
more subtle for the borderline case of a null singularity). Furthermore, we\r
1Throughout this paper, the word billiard used as a noun in the singular will denote\r
the dynamical system consisting of a ball moving freely on a “table” (region in some\r
Riemannian space), with elastic bounces against the edges. Billiard will also sometimes\r
mean the table itself.\r
3

are not making the claim here that all spacelike singularities are necessar\u0002ily and uniformly of the BKL type. Rather, the results presented here are\r
intended to refine and to generalize the work of [6, 7] by showing that, in\r
higher dimensions and for many theoretically relevant matter sources, one\r
can self-consistently describe the behaviour of all fields, in the vicinity of\r
a spacelike singularity, and at a generic spatial point x, in terms of (i) a\r
simple hyperbolic billiard description of the “angular” dynamics (γ, πγ) of\r
the logarithmic scale factors (after projection of the “radial” motion (ρ, πρ)),\r
and (ii) an asymptotic “freezing” of the other phase space variables. This\r
self-consistent asymptotic solution is general in the sense that it involves as\r
many arbitrary functions of space as the most general solution.\r
1.4 Organization of the paper\r
After fixing our conventions and notations, and defining the class of La\u0002grangians we shall consider in section 2, we discuss in section 3 the homo\u0002geneous and diagonal Kasner solution in D spacetime dimensions, with a\r
dilaton (as usual, the term “homogeneous” implies invariance under spa\u0002tial translations). This solution plays a crucial rˆole in the BKL approach\r
because it describes the “free motion between collisions” and allows us to\r
develop an important tool of our approach: the (Minkowskian) geometry of\r
the scale factors. We then introduce (in section 4) the other main tool of\r
our investigation: the Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric. To gain\r
some familiarity with it, we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of non-diagonal\r
Kasner metrics.\r
In section 5, we explain the appearance of sharp potential walls in full\r
generality, without imposing any homogeneity conditions on the metric and\r
the matter fields. We then discuss in great detail the various walls that\r
appear in physical models: symmetry walls, gravitational walls and p-form\r
walls. The resulting geometry of the “billiard” made from all these walls\r
is analyzed in section 7. Section 8 is devoted to the case when the billiard\r
can be identified with the Weyl chamber of a Kac-Moody algebra. To deal\r
with this case we set up a Kac-Moody theoretic formulation of the billiard in\r
terms of a non-linear σ-model based on the relevant Kac-Moody group in the\r
last section. As we will show there, the asymptotic limit of these σ-models\r
coincides with the asymptotic limit of the models discussed in the main\r
part of this paper. An appendix illustrating by a toy model the asymptotic\r
freezing of the off-diagonal degrees of freedom concludes this paper.\r

We should stress that our analysis is purely classical and accordingly, as\r
it stands, is valid only up to the Planck (or string) scale. We shall also ignore\r
fermionic fields throughout. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that some\r
of the ideas discussed here will remain relevant in a more general quantum\r
mechanical context, at least qualitatively (see e.g. [88] for some recent ideas\r
in this direction). The subject of Hamiltonian cosmology has a long history\r
in the context of four-dimensional, spatially homogeneous spacetimes and\r
provides useful insight on the general discussion presented here. For reviews\r
on this subject, with an extensive bibliography, see [93, 94, 61]; see also the\r
topical review on multidimensional gravity [59].\r

where units are chosen such that 16πGN = 1 (where GN is Newton’s con\u0002stant) and the spacetime dimension D ≡ d + 1 is left unspecified. Besides\r
the standard Einstein-Hilbert term the above Lagrangian contains a dilaton\r
field φ and a number of p-form fields A\r
(p)\r
M1···Mp\r
(for p ≥ 0). As a convenient\r
common formulation we adopt the Einstein conformal frame and normalize\r
the kinetic term of the dilaton φ with weight one w.r.t. to the Ricci scalar.\r
The Einstein metric GMN has Lorentz signature (− + · · · +) and is used to\r
lower or raise the indices; its determinant is denoted by G. The p-form field\r

The dots in the action (2.1) indicate possible modifications of the field\r
strength by additional Yang-Mills or Chapline-Manton-type couplings [11,\r
15], such as FC = dC(2) − C\r
(0)dB(2) for two 2-forms C(2) and B(2) and a\r
0-form C\r
(0), as they occur in type IIB supergravity. Further modifications\r
5

include Chern-Simons terms, as in the action for D = 11 supergravity [22].\r
The real parameter λp measures the strength of the coupling of A(p)to the\r
dilaton. When p = 0, we assume that λ0 6= 0 so that there is only one dilaton.\r
This is done mostly for notational convenience. If there were other dilatons\r
among the 0-forms, these should be separated off from the p-forms because\r
they play a distinct rˆole. They would define additional spacelike directions\r
in the space of the (logarithmic) scale factors and would correspondingly\r
increase the dimension of the relevant hyperbolic billiard.\r
The metric GMN , the dilaton field(s) φ and the p-form fields A\r
(p)\r
M1···Mp\r
are\r
a priori arbitrary functions of both space and time, on which no symme\u0002try conditions are imposed. Nevertheless it will turn out that the evolution\r
equations near the singularity will be asymptotically the same as those of cer\u0002tain homogeneous cosmological models. It is important to keep in mind that\r
this simplification does not follow from imposing extra dimensional reduction\r
conditions but emerges as a direct consequence of the general dynamics.\r
2.2 Gauge conditions\r
Our analysis applies both to past and future singularities, and in particular\r
to Schwarzschild-type singularities inside black holes. To follow historical\r
usage, we shall assume for definiteness that the spacelike singularity lies in\r
the past, at finite distance in proper time. More specifically, we shall adopt\r
a space-time slicing such that the singularity “occurs” on a constant time\r
slice (t = 0 in proper time). The slicing is built by use of pseudo-Gaussian\r
coordinates defined by vanishing lapse Ni = 0, with metric\r
ds2 = −(N(x\r
0\r
, xi)dx0)\r
2 + gij (x\r
0\r
, xi)dxidxj(2.3)\r
In order to simplify various formulas later, we shall find it useful to introduce\r
a rescaled lapse function\r
N˜ ≡ N/√\r
g (2.4)\r
where g ≡ det gij . We shall see that a useful gauge, within the Hamiltonian\r
approach, is that defined by requiring\r
N˜ = ρ\r
2\r
, (2.5)\r
where ρ\r
2\r
is a quadratic combination of the logarithms of the scale factors and\r
the dilaton(s), which we will define below in terms of the Iwasawa decompo\u0002sition. After fixing the time zero hypersurface the only coordinate freedom\r
6

left in the pseudo-Gaussian gauge (2.5) is that of making time-independent\r
changes of spatial coordinates x\r
i → x′i = fi\r
(x\r
j\r
). Since the gauge condi\u0002tion Eq.(2.5) is not invariant under spatial coordinate transformations, such\r
changes of coordinates have the unusual feature of also changing the slicing.\r
Throughout this paper, we will reserve the label t for the proper time\r
dt = −Ndx0 = −N˜\r
√\r
gdx0, (2.6)\r
whereas the time coordinate associated with the special gauge Eq.(2.5) will\r
be designated by T, viz.\r
dT = −\r
dt\r
ρ\r
2√g\r
. (2.7)\r
Sometimes, it will also be useful to introduce the “intermediate” time coor\u0002dinate τ that would correspond to the gauge condition N˜ = 1. It is explicitly\r
defined by:\r
dτ = −\r
dt\r
√g\r
= ρ\r
2\r
dT (2.8)\r
At the singularity the proper time t is assumed to remain finite and to de\u0002crease toward 0+. By contrast, the coordinates T and τ both increase toward\r
+∞, as ensured by the minus sign in (2.6). Irrespective of the choice of co\u0002ordinates, the spatial volume density g is assumed to collapse to zero at each\r
spatial point in this limit.\r
As for the p-form fields, we shall assume, throughout this paper, a gen\u0002eralized temporal gauge, viz.\r
A\r
(p)\r
0i2···ip = 0 (2.9)\r
where small Latin letter i, j, ... denote spatial indices from now on. This\r
choice leaves the freedom of performing time-independent gauge transforma\u0002tions, and therefore fixes the gauge only partially.\r
3 Geometry of the space of the scale factors\r
3.1 Supermetric and Hamiltonian\r
To set the stage for our general Hamiltonian approach, it is useful to study\r
first in detail the dynamics defined by considering only the kinetic terms\r
of the metric and of the dilaton(s). The corresponding reduced action is\r
7

obtained from (2.1) by setting A(p) = 0 and assuming that all the other fields\r
depend only on time. In terms of a general time coordinate x\r
0\r
this reduced\r
action reads\r
S[gij , φ, N˜ ] = Zdx0N˜ −1\r
\u0014\r

\r
tr (g−1˙g)2 − (tr g−1˙g)2\r
\u0001\r
+ φ˙2\r
\u0015\r
. (3.10)\r
where we have suppressed an integral Rd\r
dx over the spatial volume for no\u0002tational simplicity. Furthermore, we make use of the notations introduced\r
in (2.3) and (2.4) with F˙ ≡ dF/dx0, and adopt a matrix notation where\r
g(t) ∈ GL(d, R) stands for the matrix (gij ) representing the spatial compo\u0002nents of the metric at each spatial point.\r
The action (3.10) is the (quadratic-in-velocities) action for a massless free\r
particle with coordinates (gij , φ) moving in a curved target space with metric\r
dσ2 =\r

4\r
\u0002\r
tr (g−1dg)2 − (tr g−1dg)2\r
\u0003\r
+ dφ2(3.11)\r
We designate by dσ2the line element in this target “superspace” to distin\u0002guish it from the line element in physical space time, which we denote by\r
ds2. The first two terms in the r.h.s. of (3.11) define the so-called DeWitt\r
supermetric in the space of the metric coefficients gij [34]. If several dilatons\r
φ\r
i\r
(for i = 1, . . . , n) were present the term dφ2in Eq.(3.11) would be re\u0002placed by Σi(dφi\r
)\r
2\r
. That is, each dilaton adds a (flat) direction in the target\r
superspace.\r
The rescaled lapse N˜ plays the role of an “einbein” in the geodesic action\r
(3.10). As usual, extremizing over N˜ yields the “zero-mass constraint”\r

\r
tr (g−1˙g)2 − (tr g−1˙g)2\r
\u0001\r
+ φ˙2 = 0. (3.12)\r
Thus, the motion is given by a null geodesic of the metric (3.11). An affine\r
parameter along those geodesics is dτ = +Ndx ˜ 0 = −dt/√g, cf. Eq.(2.8)\r
above. In terms of the parameter τ the equations of motion read:\r

Here we have introduced a (d + 1)-dimensional space with coordinates β\r
µ\r
,\r
with indices running over µ = 1, · · · , d + 1, such that the first d coordinates\r
β\r
i\r
correspond to the logarithms of the scale factors of the spatial metric [cf.\r
Eq. (3.14)], and the (d + 1)-th coordinate β\r
d+1 ≡ φ represents the dilaton2\r
.\r
The explicit form of the (flat) target space metric Gµν can be read off directly\r
from (3.15). The action for diagonal metrics is\r
S[β\r
µ\r
, N˜] = Zdx0 N˜ −1Gµνβ˙µβ˙ ν(3.16)\r
In the sequel, we shall refer to this space as the “extended space of (logarith\u0002mic) scale factors” or just “the β-space” for short.\r
Combining the scale factors and the dilaton(s) in a single space is natural\r
because we know from Kaluza-Klein theory that the dilaton can be viewed as\r
the logarithm of a scale factor in one extra spatial dimension. Independently\r
of whether the original metric (2.3) has non-vanishing curvature or not, the\r
metric (3.15) induced in the space of the scale factors (possibly including the\r
dilaton) is flat. More precisely, the metric Gµν of the (extended) space of scale\r
factors is a Minkowski metric in R\r
d+1 with signature (− + + · · ·+). For in\u0002stance, the direction in which only the dilaton varies [i.e. dβµ ∝ (0, · · · , 0, 1)]\r
is spacelike, while the direction in which only one scale factor varies [e.g.,\r
dβµ ∝ (1, 0, · · ·, 0)] is null. A timelike direction in this space is the direction\r
dβµ ∝ (1, 1, · · ·, 1, 0). This reflects the familiar fact that the gravitational ac\u0002tion is not bounded from below (even with Euclidean signature): conformal\r
transformations of the metric, in which the scale factors are all scaled in the\r
same fashion, make dσ2 negative. It is this characteristic feature of gravity\r
which is responsible for the Lorentzian nature of the Kac-Moody algebras\r
which emerge in the analysis of the billiard symmetries [26]. The Lorentzian\r
signature of the metric in the space of the scale factors enables one to define\r
the light cone through any point. We define the time-orientation to be such\r

of n dilatons.\r

sign in front of pφ in (3.25) is included for the sake of uniformity in the\r
formulas below (if there is no dilaton one simply sets pφ = Cφ = 0). By\r
rescaling the spatial coordinates, one can set bi = 1 and obtain the standard\r
(proper time) form of the Kasner metric. The Kasner exponents pµ = (pi, pφ)\r

If there are no dilatons, it follows from the above equations that there is\r
at least one Kasner exponent which is negative, so at least one of the scale\r
factors Ai(t) blows up as t → 0. The scale factors associated with positive\r
Kasner exponents contract to zero monotonically. By contrast, in the pres\u0002ence of a dilaton, all the Kasner exponents can be positive simultaneously.\r
In both cases there is an overall contraction of the spatial volume since the\r

properties to the standard Kasner exponents, but regard them simply as parameters,\r
leaving their labels always in the lower position.\r

determinant g of the spatial metric tends to zero. Indeed, a consequence of\r
the linear constraint above on the Kasner exponents is\r
g ∝ t\r

. (3.29)\r
Note that the relations (3.23) and (3.29) have been derived only for the exact\r
(homogeneous) Kasner solution in the vacuum.\r
3.3 Hyperbolic space\r
Still as a preparation for dealing with the general inhomogeneous case, let\r
us present an alternative way of solving the dynamics defined by the ki\u0002netic terms of diagonal metrics, i.e. the action (3.16), or its Hamiltonian\r
form. This alternative way will turn out to be very useful for describing\r
the asymptotic dynamics of general inhomogeneous metrics. It consists in\r
decomposing the motion of the variables β\r
µ\r
into two pieces, namely a radial\r
part ρ, and an angular one γ\r
µ\r
. Here “radial” and “angular” refer to polar\r
coordinates in the Minkowski space of the β\r
µ\r
. More precisely, shifting, if\r
necessary, the origin in β-space to arrange that vµβ\r
µ\r
0 < 0, the β\r
µ\r
trajectories\r
(3.21) will, for large enough values of τ , get inside the future light cone of\r
the origin, i.e.\r
β\r
µβµ = 2vµβ\r
µ\r
0\r
τ + β0 µβ\r
µ\r
0 < 0. (3.30)\r
Let us then decompose β\r
µ\r
in hyperbolic polar coordinates (ρ, γµ), i.e\r
β\r
µ = ργµ\r
, (3.31)\r
where γ\r
µ are coordinates on the future sheet of the unit hyperboloid, which\r
are constrained by\r
γ\r
µ\r
γµ = −1 (3.32)\r
and ρ is the timelike variable\r
ρ\r
2 ≡ −βµβµ > 0 (3.33)\r
This decomposition naturally introduces the unit hyperboloid (“γ-space”),\r
which is a realization of the m-dimensional hyperbolic (Lobachevskii) space\r
Hm, with m = d − 1 + n if there are n ≥ 0 dilatons.\r
In terms of the “polar” coordinates ρ and γ\r
µ\r
, the metric in β-space be\u0002comes\r
dσ2 = −dρ2 + ρ\r
2\r
dΣ\r
2\r

where dΣ\r
2\r
is the metric on the γ-space Hm. In these variables the Hamilto\u0002nian reads\r

µ\r
. (It is straightforward to introduce angular coordinates on Hm to\r
derive more explicit formulas for dΣ\r
2\r
and π\r
2\r
γ\r
.) The extra index 0 on H is\r
to underline the fact that this Hamiltonian refers only to a small part of the\r
total Hamiltonian which we shall study below, because it describes only the\r
kinetic terms associated to the (d + n) variables β\r
µ\r
.\r
An equivalent expression is\r

λ ≡ ln ρ ≡\r
1\r
2\r
ln ( − Gµνβ\r
µβν\r
) (3.37)\r
with conjugate momentum πλ.\r
The form (3.36) of the Hamiltonian shows that, when using a radial pro\u0002jection on Hm, the motion becomes simplest in the gauge\r
N˜ = ρ\r
2\r
, (3.38)\r
in terms of which (3.36) reduces to a free Hamiltonian on the pseudo-Riemann\u0002ian space with metric −dλ2 +dΣ\r
2\r
. In the gauge (3.38) the logarithmic radial\r
momentum πλ = ρπρ is a constant of the motion. In this gauge, we see that\r
the free motion of the β’s is projected onto a geodesic motion on Hm.\r
The coordinate time T associated to this gauge, see Eq.(2.7), is linked to\r
the affine parameter τ via\r
dT =\r
dτ\r
ρ\r
2\r
. (3.39)\r
From (3.30) we get that ρ\r
2 varies linearly with τ :\r
ρ\r
2 = −βµβµ = −2vµβ\r
µ\r
0\r
τ − β\r
µ\r
0 β0µ (3.40)\r
which implies\r
T = −\r
1\r
2vµβ\r
µ\r
0\r
ln τ + const. (3.41)\r
13

Recalling that τ varies logarithmically with the proper time t, we see that\r
T ∝ ln | ln t|.\r
One can also use the configuration variable (3.37) as an intrinsic time\r
variable to describe the dynamics. In view of (3.40) we have\r
λ =\r
1\r
2\r
ln τ + const. =\r
1\r
2\r
ln | ln t| + const. (3.42)\r
Note that the various links above between the different time scales are derived\r
only for an exact Kasner solution. Similar relations will hold asymptotically\r
in the general inhomogeneous case (see discussion in chapter 7).\r
4 Iwasawa decomposition and dynamics of\r
non-diagonal Kasner metrics\r
4.1 Iwasawa decomposition\r
For homogeneous solutions in vacuo, the metric remains diagonal if the initial\r
data are so. This is in general not true when matter (such as p-forms) or inho\u0002mogeneities are included, in which case off-diagonal components generically\r
appear even if there are none initially. For this reason, it is important to un\u0002derstand the rˆole of off-diagonal terms already in this simpler homogeneous\r
context, by examining the evolution of initial data that are not diagonal.\r
And, as for the simple diagonal metrics above, it is instructive to study the\r
dynamics of non-diagonal metrics in several complementary ways.\r
A first way of dealing with the evolution of initially non-diagonal metrics\r
is to perform a suitable linear transformation on the diagonal Kasner solution.\r
If L is the linear transformation needed to diagonalize the initial data, it is\r
easy to see from (3.13) that the solution is given, in terms of the parameter\r
τ , by\r
g(τ ) = L\r
T\r
gK(τ ) L (4.1)\r
where T denotes transposition and gK(τ ) is the diagonal Kasner solution\r
(3.14), (3.21). The dilaton, being a scalar, is still given by the same expression\r
as before, i.e. φ = β\r
d+1 = vd+1τ + β\r
d+1\r
0\r
. Note the relation\r
det g(τ ) = (det L)\r
2\r
det gK(τ ), (4.2)\r
so that the relation (3.23) between τ and t still holds. Therefore det g still\r
goes to zero like t\r
2\r
.\r
14

A second way of describing the evolution of non-diagonal metrics is to\r
perform an Iwasawa decomposition of the metric,\r
g = N\r
T A2 N (4.3)\r
where N is an upper triangular matrix with 1’s on the diagonal and A is a\r
diagonal matrix with positive entries, which we parametrize as\r
A = exp(−β) , β = diag (β\r
1\r
, β2, · · · , βd). (4.4)\r
The explicit form of (4.3) reads\r
gij =\r
X\r
d\r
a=1\r
e\r
−2β\r
a\r
N\r
a\r
i N\r
a\r
j (4.5)\r
The evolution of the new configuration variables β\r
a = f(gij ) defined by\r
the Iwasawa decomposition differs in general from that of the quantities β\r
i\r
entering the diagonal Kasner solution (3.21), i.e. β\r
a 6= βi\r
except for the\r
special case N a\r
i = δ\r
a\r
i\r
. Henceforth in this paper, the notation β will always\r
refer to the logarithmic scale factors β\r
a w.r.t. to the Iwasawa frame (4.5) (to\r
be augmented, if needed, by the dilaton as a (d + 1)-th coordinate β\r
d+1 ≡\r
φ). Furthermore, we adopt the convention here and in the remainder that\r
summation over the spatial coordinate indices i, j, . . . is always understood,\r
whereas sums over the Iwasawa frame indices a, b, . . . will always be written\r
out.\r
One can view the Iwasawa decomposition4 as the Gram-Schmidt orthog\u0002onalisation of the initial coordinate coframe dxi\r
, which is indeed a triangular\r
process,\r

d = dxd\r
, one successively constructs the next θ’s by adding lin\u0002ear combinations of the dxk\r
(for k > j) in such a way that θ\r
d−1\r
is orthogonal\r
4The Iwasawa decomposition applies to general symmetric spaces (see e.g. [49]). In\r
our case the relevant symmetric space is the coset space SL(d, R)/SO(d) since the space\r
of positive definite symmetric matrices can be identified with GL(d, R)/O(d), which is\r
isomorphic to SL(d, R)/SO(d) × R\r

θ\r
d−2 = dxd−2 + Nd−2\r

,\r
· · · (4.7)\r
Equivalently,\r
θ\r
a = Na\r
i dxi\r
. (4.8)\r
Thus N a\r
i vanishes for a > i, is equal to one for a = i, and has a non-trivial\r
coordinate dependence only for a < i. It is easily seen that the determinant\r
of the matrix N is equal to 1. Therefore the sum of the β’s is directly related\r
to the metric determinant (as in the diagonal case): g = det g = det A2 =\r
exp ( − 2Σaβ\r
a\r
).\r
In the following we shall also need the vectorial frame {ea} dual to the\r
coframe θ\r

ea = N\r

. (4.9)\r
where the matrix N i\r
a is the inverse of N ai\r
, i.e., N a\r

. It is again an\r
upper triangular matrix with 1’s on the diagonal.\r
4.2 Asymptotics of non-diagonal Kasner metrics\r
Later in this paper we will deal with the generic inhomogeneous, non-diagonal\r
metric gij (x\r
0\r
, xi) and show how to study its Hamiltonian dynamics directly\r
in terms of the Iwasawa variables (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i) and of their conjugate momenta.\r
But let us first take advantage of the known explicit solution (4.1) of the\r
nondiagonal evolution in order to understand the qualitative behaviour of\r
the Iwasawa variables (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i) as t → 0, i.e. τ → +∞. To be concrete let us\r
explicitly consider the case of three spatial dimensions (d = 3, D = 4) using\r
the results of [51] for the Iwasawa decomposition of 3-dimensional metrics.\r

These explicit formulas show that the evolution of the Iwasawa variables\r
(β, N ) in the generic non-diagonal case is rather complicated. However,\r
what will be important in the following is that they drastically simplify in\r
the asymptotic limit t → 0, i.e. τ → +∞. Without loss of generality, one\r
can assume p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. If necessary, this can be achieved by multiplying\r
L by an appropriate permutation matrix. We shall in fact only consider\r
p1 < p2 < p3, leaving the discussion of the limiting cases to the reader. For\r
generic L, i.e. l1 6= 0, r1 6= 0, l1m2 − l2m1 6= 0, and m1r2 − m2r1 6= 0, one\r
then finds the following asymptotic behaviour as t → 0, i.e. τ → +∞ :\r
τ → +∞ : β\r
1 ∼ v1\r

l1\r
, n2 →\r
l3\r
l1\r
, n3 →\r
l1m3 − l3m1\r
l1m2 − l2m1\r
. (4.18)\r
Here we used the links derived above between (pµ, t) and (v\r
µ\r
, τ ).\r
The remarkable feature of these results is that, in the limit τ → +∞,\r
the evolution of the Iwasawa variables (β, N ) is essentially as simple as the\r
evolution we obtained in the diagonal case. Namely, the diagonal degrees of\r
freedom β in the Iwasawa decomposition behave linearly with τ , while the\r
elements of the upper triangular matrix N tend to constants. That the ni’s\r
should asymptotically tend to constants should be clear because they are\r
homogeneous functions of degree zero in the metric coefficients — in fact,\r
ratios of polynomials of degree one or two in the t\r
2pi\r
. It is more subtle that\r
the scale factors exp(−2β\r
i\r
), which are homogeneous of degree one in the gij ’s,\r
are not all driven by the fastest growing (or least decreasing) term (t\r
2p1\r
for\r
t → 0\r
+). This is what happens for the first scale factor exp(−2β1\r
). However,\r
the second scale factor exp(−2β\r
2\r
) feels the subleading term t\r
2p2 because the\r
leading term drops from its numerator, equal to the minor g11g22 − (g12)\r
2\r
.\r
18

Similar cancellations occur for the last scale factor exp(−2β\r
3\r
), which feels\r
only the smallest term t\r
2p3 as t → 0+.\r
The results (4.18) admit a simple generalization to d dimensions. By re\u0002peating the above explicit calculation, one can prove that, in any dimension\r
d, the β’s become asymptotically linear functions of τ , as in the diagonal case,\r
with coefficients that are given by a permutation of the underlying diagonal\r
Kasner exponents. Furthermore, the N a\r
i tend to constants, a phenomenon\r
which we will refer to as the “asymptotic freezing” of the off-diagonal metric\r
variables. More precisely, let v\r
1 ≤ v2 ≤ · · · ≤ vd be the ordered (unnormal\u0002ized) underlying Kasner exponents; then, for generic L, we have\r
β\r
a ∼ va\r
τ and N\r
a\r
i → const. (4.19)\r
as τ → +∞ or, equivalently, t → 0\r
+. An alternative derivation of these\r
results will follow, as a particular case, from the general result we shall de\u0002rive below concerning the qualitative evolution of generic, inhomogeneous,\r
matter-driven solutions in Iwasawa variables (after projecting out the radial\r
motion of the Iwasawa β variables).\r
Note also that, in the simple case of homogeneous nondiagonal metrics\r
in vacuo (without curvature and/or matter) one can discuss not only the\r
limit t → 0, but also the limit t → +∞ (i.e τ → −∞). In this second\r
limit, one finds again that the β’s become asymptotically linear functions of\r
τ , with coefficients that are given by a permutation of the underlying Kasner\r
exponents, and that the N a\r
i tend to constants. More precisely, for any d,\r
β\r
a ∼ v(d−a)\r
τ , while the explicit results in d = 3 read\r
τ → −∞ : β\r
1 ∼ p3τ , β2 ∼ p2τ , β3 ∼ p1τ,\r
n1 →\r

, n2 →\r
r3\r
r1\r
, n3 →\r
m1r3 − m3r1\r
m1r2 − m2r1\r
(4.20)\r
Note that in both limits, one has β\r
1 ≤ β2 ≤ · · · ≤ βd\r
. The fact that the β’s\r
are ordered in this way is due to our choice of an upper triangular N ; had we\r
taken N to be lower triangular instead, these inequalities would have been\r
reversed.\r
5 Asymptotic dynamics in the general case\r
Having warmed up with the simple diagonal and homogeneous Kasner so\u0002lution in Section 3, and having introduced the Iwasawa decomposition of\r
19

the metric (Section 4), we are now ready to apply these techniques to the\r
description of the asymptotic dynamics in the limit t → 0 to the general in\u0002homogeneous, matter-driven case. The main ingredients (already introduced\r
above for the homogeneous solutions) of our study are:\r
• use of the Hamiltonian formalism,\r
• Iwasawa decomposition of the metric, i.e. gij → (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i),\r
• decomposition of β\r
µ = (βa\r
, φ) into radial (ρ) and angular (γ\r
µ\r
) parts,\r
and\r
• use of the pseudo-Gaussian gauge (2.5), i.e. of the time coordinate T\r
as the evolution parameter.\r
More explicitly, with the conventions already described before, we assume\r
that in some spacetime patch, the metric is given by (2.3) (pseudo-Gaussian\r
gauge), such that the local volume g collapses at each spatial point as x\r
0 →\r
+∞, in such a way that the proper time t tends to 0+. We work in the\r
Hamiltonian formalism, i.e. with first order evolution equations in the phase\u0002space of the system. For instance, the gravitational degrees of freedom are\r
initially described by the metric gij and its conjugate momentum π\r
ij . We\r
systematically use the Iwasawa decomposition (4.5) of the metric to replace\r
the d(d + 1)/2 variables gij by the d + d(d − 1)/2 variables (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i). Note\r
that (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i) are ultralocal functions of gij , that is they depend, at each\r
spacetime point, only on the value of gij at that point, not on its derivatives.\r
This would not have been the case if we had used a “Kasner frame” (as\r
defined below) instead of an Iwasawa one. The transformation g → (β, N )\r
then defines a corresponding transformation of the conjugate momenta, as we\r
will explain below. We then augment the definition of the β’s by adding the\r
dilaton field, i.e. β\r
µ ≡ (βa\r
, φ), and define the hyperbolic radial coordinate ρ\r
as in (3.33). Note that ρ is also an ultralocal function of the configuration\r
variables (gij , φ). We assume that the hyperbolic coordinate ρ can be used\r
everywhere in a given region of space near the singularity as a well-defined\r
(real) quantity which tends to +∞ as we approach the singularity. We then\r
define the slicing of spacetime by imposing the gauge condition (2.5). The\r
time coordinate corresponding to this gauge is called T as above (see (2.7)).\r
Our aim is to study the asymptotic behaviour of all the dynamical variables\r
β(T), N (T), ..... as T → +∞ (recall that this limit also corresponds to t → 0,\r
20

√g → 0, ρ → +∞, with β\r
µ going to infinity inside the future light cone).\r
Of course, we must also ascertain the self-consistency of this limit, which we\r
shall refer to as the “BKL limit”.\r
5.1 Hamiltonian action\r
To focus on the features relevant to the billiard picture, we assume first that\r
there are no Chern-Simons terms or couplings of the exterior form gauge\r
fields through a modification of the curvatures F\r
(p)\r
, which are thus taken\r
to be Abelian, F\r
(p) = dA(p)\r
. We verify in subsection 6.5 below that these\r
interaction terms do not change the analysis. The Hamiltonian action in any\r
pseudo-Gaussian gauge, and in the temporal gauge (2.9), reads\r

Let us now see how the Hamiltonian action gets transformed when one\r

the spatial metric. The “supermetric” (3.11) giving the kinetic terms of the\r

We next split the Hamiltonian density5 H (5.2) in two parts, one denoted\r
by H0, which is the kinetic term for the local scale factors β\r
µ\r
(including\r
dilatons) already encountered in section 3, and a “potential density” (of\r
weight 2) denoted by V, which contains everything else. Our analysis below\r
will show why it makes sense to group the kinetic terms of both the off\u0002diagonal metric components and the p-forms with the usual potential terms,\r
i.e. the term M in (5.2). [Remembering that, in a Kaluza-Klein reduction,\r
the off-diagonal components of the metric in one dimension higher become\r
a one-form, it is not surprising that it might be useful to group together the\r
off-diagonal components and the p-forms.] Thus, we write\r
H = H0 + V (5.15)\r
with the kinetic term of the β variables\r
H0 =\r

G\r

where the r.h.s. is that already defined in (3.18), with the replacement of\r

5We use the term “Hamiltonian density” to denote both H and H. Note that H is a\r
usual spatial density (of weight 1, i.e. the same weight as √g), while H ≡ √gH/N is a\r
density of weight 2 (like g = (√g)\r
2\r
). Note also that π\r
ij is of weight 1, while N˜ ≡ N/√g\r
is of weight −1.\r

Finally, there is a contribution to the potential linked to the spatial gradients\r
of the dilaton:\r
Vφ = ggij∂iφ∂jφ. (5.23)\r
We will analyze in detail these contributions to the potential, term by term,\r
in section 6.\r
5.2 Appearance of sharp walls in the BKL limit\r
5.2.1 Derivation of central result\r
In the decomposition of the Hamiltonian given above, we have split off the\r
kinetic terms of the scale factors β\r
a and of the dilaton βd+1 ≡ φ from the\r
other variables, and assigned the off-diagonal metric components and the p\u0002form fields to various potentials, each of which is a complicated function of\r
β\r
µ\r
, N a\r
i\r
, Pi\r
a, A(p)\r
j1···jp\r
, π\r
j1···jp\r
(p)\r
and of some of their spatial gradients. The reason\r
why this separation is useful is that, as we are going to show, in the BKL\r
limit, and in the special Iwasawa decomposition which we have adopted,\r
the asymptotic dynamics is governed by the scale factors β\r
µ\r
, whereas all\r
other variables “freeze”, just like for the general Kasner solution discussed\r
in section 3. Thus, in the asymptotic limit, we have schematically\r
V\r
\u0010\r
β\r
µ\r
, N\r

j1···jp\r

j1···jp\r
(p)\r
, . . . \u0011−→ V∞(γ\r
µ\r
) (5.24)\r
where V∞(γ\r
µ\r
) stands for a sum of certain “sharp wall potentials” which\r
depend only on the angular hyperbolic coordinates γ\r
µ ≡ βµ/ρ. As a con\u0002sequence, the asymptotic dynamics can be described as a “billiard” in the\r
hyperbolic space of the γ\r
µ\r
’s, whose walls (or “cushions”) are determined by\r
the energy of the fields that are asymptotically frozen.\r
This reduction of the complicated potential to a much simpler “effective\r
potential” V∞(γ\r
µ\r
) follows essentially from the exponential dependence of\r
V on the diagonal Iwasawa variables β\r
µ\r
, from its independence from the\r
24

conjugate momenta of the β’s, and from the fact that the radial magnitude\r
ρ of the β’s becomes infinitely large in the BKL limit.\r
To see the essence of this reduction, with a minimum of technical com\u0002plications, let us consider a potential density (of weight 2) of the general\r
form\r
V(β, Q, P) = X\r
A\r
cA(Q, P) exp ( − 2wA(β)) (5.25)\r
where (Q, P) denote the remaining phase space variables (that is, other than\r
(β, πβ)). Here wA(β) = wAµβ\r
µ are certain linear forms which depend only\r
on the (extended) scale factors, and whose precise form will be derived in\r
the following section. Similarly we shall discuss below the explicit form of\r
the pre-factors cA, which will be some complicated polynomial functions of\r
the remaining fields, i.e. the off-diagonal components of the metric, the p\u0002form fields and their respective conjugate momenta, and of some of their\r
spatial gradients. The fact that the wA(β) depend linearly on the scale\r
factors β\r
µ\r
is an important property of the models under consideration. A\r
second non-trivial fact is that, for the leading contributions, the pre-factors\r
are always non-negative, i.e. c\r
leading\r
A ≥ 0. Since the values of the fields for\r
which cA = 0 constitute a set of measure zero, we will usually make the\r
“genericity assumption” cA > 0 for the leading terms in the potential V\r
6\r
.\r
The third fact following from the detailed analysis of the walls that we shall\r
exploit is that all the leading walls are timelike, i.e. their normal vectors (in\r
the Minkowski β-space) are spacelike.\r
As shown in section 3.3, the part of the Hamiltonian describing the kinetic\r
energy of the β’s, H0 = N˜H0, takes the form (3.36) when parametrizing β\r
µ\r
in terms of ρ and γ\r
µ\r
, or equivalently, λ ≡ ln ρ and γ\r
µ\r
(cf. Eq. (3.37)).\r
Choosing the gauge (2.5) to simplify the kinetic terms H0 we end up with an\r
Hamiltonian of the form\r
H(λ, πλ, γ, πγ, Q, P) = N˜H (5.26)\r

where π\r
2\r
γ\r
is the kinetic energy of a particle moving on Hm. In (5.26) and\r
below we shall regard λ as a primary dynamical variable (so that ρ ≡ e\r
λ\r
).\r
6Understanding the effects of the possible failure of this assumption is one of the subtle\r
issues in establishing a rigorous proof of the BKL picture.\r
25

The essential point is now that, in the BKL limit, λ → +∞ i.e. ρ → +∞,\r
each term ρ\r
2\r
exp (−2ρwA(γ)) becomes a sharp wall potential, i.e. a function\r
of wA(γ) which is zero when wA(γ) > 0, and +∞ when wA(γ) < 0. To\r
formalize this behaviour we define the sharp wall Θ-function7 as\r
Θ(x) := \u001A\r
0 if x < 0\r
+∞ if x > 0\r
(5.27)\r
A basic formal property of this Θ-function is its invariance under multiplica\u0002tion by a positive quantity. With the above assumption checked below that\r
all the relevant prefactors cA(Q, P) are positive near each leading wall, we\r
can formally write\r
lim\r
ρ→∞ h\r
cA(Q, P)ρ\r
2\r
exp ( − ρwA(γ)\r
i\r
= cA(Q, P)Θ( − 2wA(γ)) ≡ Θ( − 2wA(γ)).\r
(5.28)\r
Of course, Θ(−2wA(γ)) = Θ(−wA(γ)), but we shall keep the extra factor of 2\r
to recall that the arguments of the exponentials, from which the Θ-functions\r
originate, come with a well-defined normalization. Therefore, the limiting\r
Hamiltonian density reads\r
H∞(λ, πλ, γ, πγ, Q, P) = 1\r

A′\r
Θ( − 2wA′(γ)), (5.29)\r
where A′runs over the dominant walls. The set of dominant walls is defined\r
as the minimal set of wall forms which suffice to define the billiard table, i.e.\r
such that the restricted set of inequalities {wA′(γ) ≥ 0} imply the full set\r
{wA(γ) ≥ 0}. The concept of dominant wall will be illustrated below. [Note\r
that the concept of “dominant” wall is a refinement of the distinction, which\r
will also enter our discussion, between a leading wall and a subleading one.]\r
The crucial point is that the limiting Hamiltonian (5.29) no longer de\u0002pends on λ, Q and P. Therefore the Hamiltonian equations of motion for\r
λ, Q and P tell us that the corresponding conjugate momenta, i.e. πλ, P and\r
Q, respectively, all become constants of the motion in the limit λ → +∞.\r
The total Hamiltonian density H∞ is also a constant of the motion (which\r
must be set to zero). The variable λ evolves according to dλ/dT = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλ.\r
Hence, in the limit, λ is a linear function of T. The only non-trivial dynamics\r
7One should more properly write Θ∞(x), but since this is the only step function en\u0002countered in this article, we use the simpler notation Θ(x).\r
26

resides in the evolution of (γ, πγ) which reduces to the sum of a free (non\r
relativistic) kinetic term π\r
2\r
γ\r
/4 and a sum of sharp wall potentials, such that\r
the resulting motion of the γ’s indeed constitutes a billiard, with geodesic\r
motion on the unit hyperboloid Hm interrupted by reflections on the walls\r
defined by wA(γ) = 0. These walls are hyperplanes (in the sense of hyper\u0002bolic geometry) because they are geometrically given by the intersection of\r
the unit hyperboloid β\r
µβµ = −1 with the usual Minkowskian hyperplanes\r
wA(β) = 0.\r
We note in passing that an alternative route for reducing the dynamics\r
to a billiard in γ-space would be to eliminate the variable λ by solving the\r
Hamiltonian constraint for πλ. This allows one to use λ as a time variable,\r
and is similar to going from the quadratic form of the action of a relativistic\r
particle to its “square-root form”\r

As the above derivation of the asymptotic constancy of all the phase-space\r
variables (Q, P) may seem a bit formal, we study, in Appendix A, a simplified\r
model explicitly showing how this asymptotic constancy arises. This toy\r
model also exemplifies the residual, asymptotically decaying variations of\r
(Q, P) as ρ → ∞.\r
5.2.2 Finite volume vs. infinite volume\r
Geodesic motion in a billiard in hyperbolic space has been much studied. It\r
is known that this motion is chaotic or non-chaotic depending on whether\r
the billiard has finite or infinite volume [81, 52, 101, 36]. In the finite volume\r
case, the generic evolution exhibits an infinite number of collisions with the\r
walls with strong chaotic features (“oscillating behavior”).\r
By contrast, if the billiard has infinite volume, the evolution is non\u0002chaotic. For a generic evolution, there are only finitely many collisions with\r
the walls. The system generically settles after a finite time in a Kasner-like\r
motion that lasts all the way to the singularity.\r
27

5.2.3 β-space description\r
The above derivation relied on the use of hyperbolic polar coordinates (ρ, γ).\r
This use is technically useful in that it represents the walls as being located\r
at an asymptotically fixed position in hyperbolic space, namely wA(γ) = 0.\r
However, once one has derived the final result (5.29), one can reexpress it\r
in terms of the original variables β\r
µ\r
, which run over a linear (Minkowski)\r
space. Owing to the linearity of wA(β) = ρwA(γ) in this Minkowskian pic\u0002ture, the asymptotic motion takes place in a “polywedge”, bounded by the\r
hyperplanes wA(β) = 0. The billiard motion then consists of free motions\r
of β\r
µ on straight lightlike lines within this polywedge, which are interrupted\r
by specular reflections off the walls. [See formula (7.3) below for the explicit\r
effect of these reflections on the components of the velocity vector of the\r
β-particle.] Indeed, when going back to β-space (i.e. before taking the BKL\r
limit), the dynamics of the scale factors at each point of space is given by\r
the Hamiltonian\r

The β-space dynamics simplifies in the gauge N˜ = 1, corresponding to the\r
time coordinate τ . In the BKL limit, the Hamiltonian (5.31) takes the lim\u0002iting form (in the gauge N˜ = 1)\r

4G\r

X\r
A′\r
Θ( − 2wA′(β)) (5.32)\r
where the sum is again only over the dominant walls. When taking equal\r
time slices of this polywedge (e.g., slices on which Σiβ\r
i\r
is constant), it is\r
clear that with increasing time (i.e increasing Σiβ\r
i\r
, or increasing τ or ρ) the\r
walls recede from the observer. The β-space picture is useful for simplifying\r
the mathematical representation of the dynamics of the scale factors which\r
takes place in a linear space. However, it is inconvenient both for proving\r
that the exponential walls of (5.31) do reduce, in the large Σiβ\r
i\r
limit to\r
sharp walls, and for dealing with the dynamics of the other phase-space\r
variables (Q, P), whose appearance in the coefficients cA has been suppressed\r
in (5.31) above. Let us only mention that, in order to prove, in this picture,\r
the freezing of the phase space variables (Q, P) one must consider in detail\r
the accumulation of the “redshifts” of the energy-momentum πµ of the β\u0002particle when it undergoes reflections on the receding walls, and the effect\r
28

of the resulting decrease of the magnitudes of the components of πµ on the\r
evolution of (Q, P). (In the notation of Appendix A, it is important to take\r
into account the fact that p0 decreases with time.) By contrast, the γ-space\r
picture that we used above allows for a more streamlined treatment of the\r
effect of the limit ρ → +∞ on the sharpening of the walls and on the freezing\r
of (Q, P).\r
In summary, the dynamics simplifies enormously in the asymptotic limit.\r
It becomes ultralocal in that it reduces to a continuous superposition of\r
evolution systems (depending only on a time parameter) for the scale factors\r
and the dilatons, at each spatial point, with asymptotic freezing of the off\u0002diagonal and p-form variables. This ultralocal description of the dynamics\r
is valid only asymptotically. It would make no sense to speak of a billiard\r
motion prior to this limit, because one cannot replace the exponentials by\r
Θ-functions. Prior to this limit, the evolution system for the scale factors\r
involves the coefficients in front of the exponential terms, and the evolution\r
of these coefficients depends on various spatial gradients of the other degrees\r
of freedom. However, one may contemplate setting up an expansion in which\r
the sharp wall model is replaced by a model with exponential (“Toda-like”)\r
potentials, and where the evolution of the quantities entering the coefficients\r
of these “Toda walls” is treated as a next to leading effect. See [28] for\r
the definition of the first steps of such an expansion scheme for maximal\r
supergravity in eleven dimensions.\r
5.3 Kasner frames vs. Iwasawa frames\r
At this point, we want to clarify an issue that might at first sight seem\r
paradoxical to the reader. In most of the BKL literature (notably in the\r
original analysis of [6, 8]), one tries to construct the metric in frames equal\r
(or close) to “Kasner frames”8. These are defined as frames with respect\r
to which both the spatial metric and the extrinsic curvature are diagonal.\r
Once the time slicing has been fixed, this geometric frame is unique, up\r
to time-dependent rescalings of each basis vector, when the eigenvalues of\r
the extrinsic curvature are distinct and some definite ordering of the (time\u0002independent) eigenvalues pa has been adopted. It is not clear how to fix in\r
a rigourous (and useful) manner the arbitrary time-dependent rescalings of\r
8We know, however, no detailed development of the Hamiltonian formalism within such\r
a frame whose definition involves both the metric variables and their conjugate momenta.\r
29

each basis vector. However, this can be done (following [7]) in an approximate\r
manner by considering the evolution of the geometry at each spatial point\r
as a succession of free Kasner flights interrupted by collisions against the\r
walls. More precisely, one can uniquely fix the normalization of the Kasner\r
frame by imposing two requirements: (i) that the Kasner frame be time\u0002independent during each Kasner epoch, i.e. that the Lie derivative of the\r
frame vectors along ∂/∂t be zero, and (ii) that the linear transformation\r
between two successive Kasner frames has the special form given in (5.35)\r
below (and not (5.35) up to some time-independent rescaling).\r
More explicitly, if we consider the three-dimensional case for definiteness\r
and denote the covariant components of the frame by {li, mi, ri}, one has\r
(suppressing the x-dependence)\r
gij (t) = A\r

the scale factors Aa(t) vary like a power law during each Kasner free flight (say\r

a\r
t\r
p\r
′\r
a during the next, with\r
some interpolating behaviour during the collision). Ref. [7] has argued (by\r
studying the effect of one collision in the “incoming” frame {li, mi, ri}, and\r
by rediagonalizing the “outgoing” metric) that the transformation between\r
the two successive Kasner frames could be written as:\r
l\r
′\r
i = li\r
, m′\r
i = mi + σmli\r
, r′\r
i = ri + σrli (5.35)\r
Here, σm and σr are quantities which can a priori be of order unity.\r
The seeming paradox is that according to [7] the σm and σr do not get\r
smaller for collisions closer to the singularity, so that the transformation\r
(5.35) from the old Kasner axes l to the new Kasner axes l\r
′\r
is of order one,\r
no matter how close one gets to the singularity; therefore, the Kasner axes\r
generically never “come to rest” if there is an infinite number of collisions. On\r
the other hand, as we just saw, the Iwasawa frames become approximately\r
time-independent for asymptotic values of τ , and the extrinsic curvature\r
approximately diagonal.\r
30

We now show that there is no contradiction between the oscillatory behav\u0002ior of the Kasner axes (in the generic inhomogeneous case) and the asymp\u0002totic freezing of the off-diagonal components N in the Iwasawa frame. The\r
key point is the very restricted form of the change (5.35) of the covariant\r
components during a collision. Recall first that the covariant components of\r
the Iwasawa frame are given the three covectors appearing as the three lines\r
of the matrix N , i.e. θ\r
1 = dx1 + n1dx2 + n2dx3\r
, θ2 = dx2 + n3dx3, θ3 = dx3.\r
[Note also in passing that, contrary to the Kasner frames, the Iwasawa frames\r
are not geometrically uniquely defined since one can redefine the coordinates\r
x\r
i\r
.]\r
Let us now see what (5.35) implies for the change in the Iwasawa variables.\r
For doing this we need to relate these to the li, mi, ni. This was done in\r
section 4.2 for the simple exact Kasner solution and is easy to generalize to\r
the case of an oscillatory metric. Indeed, when one is not in the “collision\r
region” (and this can be applied both before and after the specific collision\r
under consideration in (5.35)), the coordinate components of the metric take\r
the form (5.33) or (5.34) with A2\r
2 ≪ A21\r
and A2\r
3 ≪ A22\r
. As the definition of\r
the Iwasawa components na is purely algebraic, we can apply the formulas\r
(4.16)-(4.17) of section 4.2 to the present case. It suffices to replace t\r
pa by\r
Aa everywhere. Then, it is easy to see that n1, n2 and n3 are still given by\r
the same final formula as above, i.e\r
n1 =\r
l2\r
l1\r
, n2 =\r
l3\r
l1\r
, n3 =\r
l1m3 − l3m1\r
l1m2 − l2m1\r
, (5.36)\r
(before the collision) and\r
n\r
′\r
1 =\r
l\r

l\r

3m′1\r
l\r
′\r
1m′2 − l\r
′\r
2m′1\r
, (5.37)\r
(after the collision). If we substitute in this second formula l\r
′\r
i\r
, m′\r
i\r
and r\r
′\r
i\r
in\r
terms of li, mi and ri according to (5.35), we get the same values for the\r
Iwasawa off-diagonal variables n1, n2 and n3, before and after the collision,\r
namely, n\r
′\r
1 = n1, n\r
′\r
2 = n2, n\r
′\r
3 = n3. There is thus no contradiction between\r
the change of Kasner axes (5.35) and the freezing of the off-diagonal Iwasawa\r
variables. The same conclusion holds for collisions against the other types of\r
walls, where the Kasner axes “rotate” as in (5.35).\r
31

5.4 Constraints\r
We have just seen that in the BKL limit, the evolution equations become\r
ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Although the spatial\r
points are decoupled in the evolution equations, they are, however, still cou\u0002pled via the constraints. These constraints just restrict the initial data and\r
need only be imposed at one time, since they are preserved by the dynamical\r
equations of motion. Indeed, one easily finds that, in the BKL limit,\r
H˙ = 0 (5.38)\r
since [H(x), H(x\r
′\r
)] = 0 in the ultralocal limit. This corresponds simply to\r
the fact that the collisions preserve the lightlike character of the velocity\r
vector. Furthermore, the gauge constraints (5.8) are also preserved in time\r
since the Hamiltonian constraint is gauge-invariant. In the BKL limit, the\r
momentum constraint fulfills\r
H˙\r
k(x) = ∂kH ≈ 0 (5.39)\r
It is important that the restrictions on the initial data do not bring dangerous\r
constraints on the coefficients of the walls in the sense that these may all take\r
non-zero values. For instance, it is well known that it is consistent with the\r
Gauss law to take non-vanishing electric and magnetic energy densities; thus\r
the coefficients of the electric and magnetic walls are indeed generically non\u0002vanishing. In fact, the constraints are essentially conditions on the spatial\r
gradients of the variables entering the wall coefficients, not on these variables\r
themselves. In some non-generic contexts, however, the constraints could\r
force some of the wall coefficients to be zero; the corresponding walls would\r
thus be absent. [E.g., for vacuum gravity in four dimensions, the momentum\r
constraints for some Bianchi homogeneous models force some symmetry wall\r
coefficients to vanish. But this is peculiar to the homogeneous case.]\r
It is easy to see that the number of arbitrary physical functions involved\r
in the solution of the asymptotic BKL equations of motion is the same as\r
in the general solution of the complete Einstein-matter equations. Indeed,\r
the number of constraints on the initial data and the residual gauge freedom\r
are the same in both cases. Further discussion of the constraints in the BKL\r
context may be found in [2, 29].\r
32

5.5 Consistency of BKL behaviour in spite of the in\u0002crease of spatial gradients\r
The essential assumption in the BKL analysis, also made in the present pa\u0002per, is the asymptotic dominance of time derivatives with respect to space\r
derivatives near a spacelike singularity. This assumption has been mathe\u0002matically justified, in a rigorous manner, in the cases where the billiard is of\r
infinite volume, i.e. in the (simple) cases where the asymptotic behaviour is\r
not chaotic, but is monotonically Kasner-like [2, 29].\r
On the other hand, one might a priori worry that this assumption is\r
self-contradictory in those cases where the billiard is of finite volume, when\r
the asymptotic behaviour is chaotic, with an infinite number of oscillations.\r
Indeed, it has been pointed out [72, 4] that the independence of the billiard\r
evolution at each spatial point will have the effect of infinitely increasing\r
the spatial gradients of various quantities, notably of the local values of the\r
Kasner exponents pµ(x). This increase of spatial gradients towards the singu\u0002larity has been described as a kind of turbulent behaviour of the gravitational\r
field, in which energy is pumped into shorter and shorter length scales [72, 4],\r
and, if it were too violent, it would certainly work against the validity of the\r
BKL assumption of asymptotic dominance of time derivatives. For instance,\r
in our analysis of gravitational walls in the following section, we will en\u0002counter subleading walls, whose prefactors depend on spatial gradients of\r
the logarithmic scale factors β.\r
To address the question of consistency of the BKL assumption we need to\r
know how fast the spatial gradients of β, and of similar quantities entering\r
the prefactors, grow near the singularity. Let us consider the spatial gradient\r
of β ≡ ργ, which is\r
∂iβ = ρ∂iγ + ργ∂iλ (5.40)\r
As we are working here in the gauge (2.5), the spatial derivatives must be\r
taken with fixed T. We know that, asymptotically, λ is a linear function of\r
T, i.e. λ = a(x)T + b(x) where a(x) = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλ(x) is linked to the (spatially\r
dependent) conjugate momentum of λ. Therefore the spatial gradient ∂iλ =\r
T ∂ia(x) + ∂ib(x) behaves linearly in T, so that ∂iλ ∝ λ ≡ ln ρ. The second\r
term in (5.40) consequently behaves as γρ ln ρ when ρ → ∞. Let us now\r
estimate the first term (which will turn out to dominate the sum).\r
To estimate ∂iγ we can use the standard results on billiards on hyperbolic\r
space. Indeed, dxi∂iγ can be thought of as the infinitesimal deviation between\r
33

two billiard trajectories. The chaotic behaviour of the billiard implies that\r
this deviation will grow exponentially with T. In fact, because we work\r
on Hm with curvature −1 the Liapunov exponent for billiard trajectories is\r
equal to one, when using geodesic length as time parameter. Remembering\r
the Hamiltonian constraint π\r
2\r
λ = π\r
2\r
γ\r
, the geodesic length is simply equal to\r
λ. This yields the growth estimate\r
∂iγ = O(1) exp λ = O(1)ρ (5.41)\r
where the coefficient O(1) is a chaotically oscillating quantity. This estimate\r
is not affected by the collisions against the walls because these preserve the\r
angles made by neighboring trajectories (the walls are hyperplanes). Insert\u0002ing (5.41) in (5.40), we see that the first term indeed dominates the second.\r
We conclude that the chaotic character of the billiard indeed implies an un\u0002limited growth of the spatial gradients of β, but that this growth is only of\r
polynomial order in ρ\r
∂iβ = O(1)ρ\r
2\r
. (5.42)\r
This polynomial growth of ∂iβ (and of its second-order spatial derivatives)\r
entails a polynomial growth of the prefactors of the sub-dominant walls in\r
section 6.2. Because it is polynomial (in ρ), this growth is, however, negligible\r
compared to the exponential (in ρ) behaviour of the various potential terms.\r
It does not jeopardize our reasoning based on keeping track of the various\r
exponential behaviours. As we will see the potentially dangerously growing\r
terms that we have controlled here appear only in subdominant walls. The\r
reasoning of the Appendix shows that the prefactors of the dominant walls\r
are self-consistently predicted to evolve very little near the singularity.\r
We conclude that the unlimited growth of some of the spatial gradients\r
does not affect the consistency of the BKL analysis done here. This does\r
not mean, however, that it will be easy to promote our analysis to a rigorous\r
mathematical proof. The main obstacle to such a proof appears to be the\r
existence of exceptional points, where a prefactor of a dominant wall happens\r
to vanish, or points where a subdominant wall happens to be comparable to\r
a dominant one. Though the set of such exceptional points is (generically)\r
of measure zero, their density might increase near the singularity because of\r
the increasing spatial gradients. This situation might be compared to the\r
KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) one, where the “bad” tori have a small\r
measure, but are interspersed densely among the “good” ones.\r
34

5.6 BKL limit vs. other limits\r
The last issue which we wish to address in this chapter concerns the relation\r
of the BKL limit to other limits considered in the literature, such as the\r
strong coupling limit, or the “small tension limit”, as well as the relation\r
with asymptotically velocity dominated solutions.\r
It is sometimes useful to separate the time derivatives (conjugate mo\u0002menta) in the Hamiltonian from the space derivatives, viz.\r
H = K\r
′ + εV′\r
(5.43)\r
where ε = ±1 according to whether the spacetime signature is Lorentzian\r
(ε = 1) or Euclidean (ε = −1). Here,\r
K\r
′ = H0 + VS + Vel\r
(p)\r
(5.44)\r
contains all the kinetic terms, and\r
V\r
′ = VG + V\r
magn\r
(p) + Vφ (5.45)\r
the terms with spatial derivatives. We stress that this split is different from\r
the one introduced in subsection 5.1, where only the kinetic terms of the\r
sclae factors and the dilatons were kept as such. The above split is useful\r
because for some models the asymptotic dynamics is entirely controlled by\r
K′, i.e., by the limit ε = 0. This happens whenever the billiard that emerges\r
in the BKL limit is defined by the symmetry and electric walls, as for in\u0002stance for D = 11 supergravity [24], or the pure Einstein-Maxwell system in\r
spacetime dimensions D ≥ 5 [25, 74]. Curvature and magnetic walls are then\r
subdominant, i.e., spatial gradients become negligible as one approaches the\r
singularity.\r
If the curvature and magnetic walls can be neglected, the evolution equa\u0002tions are exactly the same as the equations of motion obtained by performing\r
a direct torus reduction to 1 + 0 dimensions. We stress, however, that no ho\u0002mogeneity assumption has to be made here. The effective torus dimensional\r
reduction follows from the dynamics and is not imposed by hand.\r
The limit ε = 0 is known as the “zero signature limit” [97] and lies\r
half-way between spacetimes of Minkowskian or Lorentzian signature. It\r
corresponds to a vanishing velocity of light (or vanishing “medium tension”);\r
the underlying geometry is built on the Carroll contraction of the Lorentz\r
35

group [50]. The terminology “strong coupling” is also used [55] and stems\r
from the fact that, with appropriate rescalings, H can be rewritten as\r
H = GN K\r
′ + G−1\r
N V\r
′\r
(5.46)\r
such that the limit in question corresponds to large values of Newton’s con\u0002stant GN . The interest in this ultrarelativistic (“Carrollian”) limit has re\u0002cently been revived in [30, 78, 1] and [46].\r
If there are only finitely many collisions with the walls (corresponding to\r
a billiard of infinite volume) the dynamics in the vicinity of the singularity\r
becomes even simpler. After the last collision, the asymptotic dynamics is\r
controlled solely by the kinetic energy H0 of the scale factors. This case where\r
both spatial gradients and matter (here p-form) terms can be neglected,\r
has been called “asymptotically velocity-dominated” (or “AVD”) in [35] and\r
allows a rigorous analysis of its asymptotic dynamics by means of Fuchsian\r
techniques [2, 29]. By contrast, rigorous results are rare for the case of\r
infinitely many collisions (see, however, the recent analytic advances in [91]).\r
Besides the existing rigorous results, there also exists a wealth of numerical\r
support for the BKL ideas [10, 9].\r
6 Walls\r
The decomposition (5.15) of the Hamiltonian gives rise to different types\r
of walls, which we now discuss in turn. Specifically, we will derive explicit\r
formulas for the linear forms wA(β) and the field dependence of the pre\u0002factors cA entering the various potentials.\r
6.1 Centrifugal (or symmetry) walls\r
We start by analyzing the effects of the off-diagonal metric components which\r
will give rise to the so-called “symmetry walls”. As they originate from the\r
gravitational action they are always present. The relevant contributions to\r
the potential is the centrifugal potential (5.18). When comparing (5.18) to\r
the general form (5.25) analyzed above, we see that firstly the summation\r
index A must be interpreted as a double index (a, b), with the restriction\r
a < b, secondly that the corresponding prefactor is cab = (P\r
j\r
aN b\r
j )\r
2\r
is auto\u0002matically non-negative (in accordance with our genericity assumptions, we\r
36

shall assume cab > 0). The centrifugal wall forms read:\r
w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) ≡ w\r
S\r
(ab)µβ\r
µ ≡ βb − βa\r
(a < b). (6.1)\r
We refer to these wall forms as the “symmetry walls” for the following reason.\r
When applying the general collision law (7.3) derived below to the case of the\r
collision on the wall (6.1) one easily finds that its effect on the components of\r
the velocity vector v\r
µ\r
is simply to permute the components v\r
a and vb\r
, while\r
leaving unchanged the other components µ 6= a, b.\r
The hyperplanes w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) = 0 (i.e. the symmetry walls) are timelike since\r
G\r
µνwS\r
(ab)µw\r
S\r
(ab)ν = +2 (6.2)\r
This ensures that the symmetry walls intersect the hyperboloid Gµνβ\r
µβν =\r
−1, P\r
a\r
β\r
a ≥ 0. The symmetry billiard (in β-space) is defined to be the\r
region of Minkowski space determined by the inequalities\r
w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) ≥ 0, (6.3)\r
with P\r
a\r
β\r
a ≥ 0 (i.e. by the region of β-space where the Θ functions are\r
zero). Its projection on the hyperbolic space Hm is defined by the inequalities\r
w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(γ) ≥ 0.\r
The explicit expressions above of the symmetry wall forms also allow us to\r
illustrate the notion of a “dominant wall” defined in subsection 5.2.1 above.\r
Indeed, the d(d − 1)/2 inequalities (6.3) already follow from the following\r
minimal set of d − 1 inequalities\r
β\r
2 − β1 ≥ 0, β3 − β2 ≥ 0, · · · , βd − βd−1 ≥ 0 (6.4)\r
More precisely, each linear form which must be positive in (6.3) can be written\r
as a linear combination, with positive (in fact, integer) coefficients of the\r
linear forms entering the subset (6.4). For instance, β\r
3 − β1 = (β3 − β2\r
) +\r
(β\r
2−β1\r
), etc. In the last section, we will reinterpret this result by identifying\r
the dominant linear forms entering (6.4) with the simple roots of SL(n, R).\r
Note that, in principle, the final set of dominant walls can only be decided\r
when one starts from the complete list of all the dynamically relevant walls.\r
In all the models we examine the set of dominant symmetry walls (6.4) will,\r
however, be part of the final minimal set of dominant walls defining the\r
complete billiard table.\r
37

If only the symmetry walls were present in the Hamiltonian, one would\r
easily deduce from the above the following picture of the dynamics: When\r
the trajectory hits a wall β\r
a+1 = βa\r
from within the interior of the billiard\r
β\r
a+1 − βa > 0 it undergoes a reflection which reorders va+1 and va\r
from\r
the incident state v\r
a+1 < va\r
(in which β\r
a+1 − βa decreases towards zero)\r
into an outgoing state v\r
a+1 > va\r
(in which β\r
a+1 − βa\r
increases away from\r
zero). Each collision reorders a pair of velocity components so that, after a\r
finite number of collisions, they will get reordered in a stable configuration\r
where v\r
1 ≤ v2\r
· · · ≤ v\r
d and β1 ≤ β2\r
· · · ≤ β\r
d\r
. The motion would then\r
continue freely, i.e. without collisions, after the last reordering reflection.\r
The same conclusion was already reached in Section 4 by a direct calculation\r
of the dynamics of the Iwasawa scale factors of non-diagonal Kasner metrics\r
(which is, indeed, a case where only symmetry walls are present).\r
If we still consider for a moment the simple case of homogeneous but\r
non-diagonal metrics and recall that the metric can be diagonalized at all\r
times by a time-independent coordinate transformation x\r
i → x′i = Li\r
jx\r
j\r
, it\r
might appear that the symmetry walls, which are related to the off-diagonal\r
components, are only a gauge artifact with no true physical content. This\r
conclusion, however, would be incorrect. First, the transformation needed to\r
diagonalize the metric may not be a globally well-defined coordinate transfor\u0002mation if the spatial sections have non-trivial topology, e.g., are tori, since it\r
would conflict in general with periodicity conditions. Second, even if the spa\u0002tial sections are homeomorphic to R\r
d\r
, the transformation x\r
i → x′i = Li\r
jx\r
j\r
,\r
although a diffeomorphism, is not a proper gauge transformation in the sense\r
that it is generated by a non-vanishing charge, and therefore two solutions\r
that differ by such a transformation should be regarded as physically distinct\r
(although related by a symmetry). Initial conditions, for which the metric\r
is diagonal and hence the symmetry walls are absent, form a set of measure\r
zero.\r
Let us finally mention the possibility of alternative treatments of the\r
dynamics of off-diagonal metric components. We have just shown that the\r
Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric leads to a projected description\r
of the GL(d, R)/SO(d)-geodesics as motions in the space of the scale factors\r
with exponential (“Toda-like”) potentials. An alternative description can\r
be based on the decomposition G = RT A R of the spatial metric, where\r
R ∈ SO(d) and A is diagonal [92, 70]. One then gets Calogero-like potentials\r
∝ sinh−2(β\r
a − βb\r
). In the BKL limit, these potentials can be replaced by\r
sharp wall potentials but whether the system lies to the left or to the right\r
38

of the wall β\r
a − βb = 0 depends on the initial conditions in this alternative\r
description.\r
6.2 Curvature (gravitational) walls\r
Next we analyze the gravitational potential, which requires a computation\r
of curvature. To that end, one must explicitly express the spatial curvature\r
in terms of the scale factors and the off-diagonal variables N a\r
i\r
. Again, the\r
calculation is most easily done in the Iwasawa frame (4.8), in which the\r
metric assumes the form (4.6). We use the short-hand notation Aa ≡ e\r
−β\r
a\r
for the (Iwasawa) scale factors. Let C\r
a\r
bc(x) be the structure functions of the\r

will not be needed here. The only property of Fa that will be of importance is\r
that it is a polynomial of degree two in the derivatives ∂β and of degree one\r
in ∂\r
2β. Thus, the exponential dependence on the β’s which determines the\r
asymptotic behaviour in the BKL limit, occurs only through the A2\r

written explicitly in (6.13).\r
In (6.13) one obviously has b 6= c because the structure functions C\r

antisymmetric in the pair [bc]. In addition to this restriction, we can assume,\r
without loss of generality, that a 6= b, c in the first sum on the right-hand side\r

respectively. Note that αabc is symmetric under the exchange of b with c, but\r
that the index a plays a special role.\r
Comparing the result (6.14) to the general form (5.25) we see that there\r
are, a priori, two types of gravitational walls: the α-type and the µ-type.\r
The α-type walls clearly come with positive prefactors, proportional to the\r
square of a structure function C\r
a\r
bc . The µ-type terms seem to pose a problem\r
because they do not have a definite sign. It would therefore seem that, in\r
the BKL limit, the gravitational potential would tend to\r
lim\r
ρ→∞\r
VG =\r
X\r
a,b,c\r
′\r
Θ[−2αabc(β)] +X\r
a\r
\u0010\r
± Θ[−2µa(β)]\u0011(6.17)\r
However, the indefinite µ-type terms can generically be neglected in the BKL\r
limit. This is most simply seen by noting that the inequalities αabc(β) ≥ 0\r
imply µa(β) ≥ 0 because µa is a linear combination with positive coefficients\r
of the αabc’s. Indeed, we can write µc = (αabc+αbca)/2. Therefore the α-walls\r
dominate the µ-ones.\r
In fact, one can establish a stronger result, namely µa(β) ≥ 0 within\r
the entire future light cone of the β’s. For this purpose, we note first that\r
each linear form µa(β) is lightlike, i.e. Gµν (µa)µ(µa)ν = 0. Therefore, each\r
hyperplane µa(β) = 0 is tangent to the light cone along some null generator.\r
This means that the future light cone is entirely on one side of the hyperplane\r
µa(β) = 0 (i.e., either µa(β) > 0 for all points inside the future light cone or\r
µa(β) < 0). Now, the point β\r
1 = β2 = · · · = βd = 1 is inside the future light\r
cone and makes all the µa’s positive. Hence µa(β) > 0 inside the future light\r
cone for each a and Θ[−2µa(β)] = 0, and we really have\r
lim\r
ρ→∞\r
VG =\r
X\r
a,b,c\r
′\r
Θ[−2αabc(β)]. (6.18)\r
Note, however, that the µ-type walls may make their existence felt in the\r
exceptional case when β is close to the lightlike direction defined by µ. This\r
is the case of “small oscillations” considered by BKL in [6, 8], for which they\r
verify (for d = 3) that the evolution is indeed controlled by the αabc-terms\r
even in that region.\r
41

From these considerations we deduce the additional constraints\r
αabc(β) ≥ 0 (D > 3) (6.19)\r
besides the symmetry inequalities (6.4). The hyperplanes αabc(β) = 0 are\r
called the “curvature” or “gravitational” walls. Like the symmetry walls,\r
they are timelike since\r
G\r
µν (αabc)µ(αabc)ν = +2 (6.20)\r
The restriction D > 3 is due to the fact that in D = 3 spacetime dimensions,\r
the gravitational walls αabc(β) = 0 are absent, simply because one cannot\r
find three distinct spatial indices. In this case all gravitational walls are of\r
subdominant type µa and thus, in the BKL limit,\r
VG ≃\r
X\r
a\r
( ± Θ[−2µa(β)]) ≃ 0 (D = 3). (6.21)\r
This is, of course, in agreement with expectations, because gravity in three\r
spacetime dimensions has no propagating degrees of freedom (gravitational\r
waves).\r
The fact that the gravitational potential becomes, in the BKL limit, a\r
positive sum of sharp wall potentials, is remarkable for several reasons. First,\r
the final form of the potential is quite simple, even though the curvature is\r
a rather complicated function of the metric and its derivatives. Secondly,\r
the limiting expression of the potential is positive, even though there are\r
subdominant terms in VG with indefinite sign. Thirdly, it is ultralocal in the\r
scale factors, i.e. involves only the scale factors but not their derivatives. It\r
is this fact that accounts for the decoupling of the various spatial points.\r
The coefficients of the dominant exponentials involve only the undiffer\u0002entiated structure functions C\r
a\r
bc. Consequently, one can model the grav\u0002itational potential in leading order by spatially homogeneous cosmologies,\r
which have constant structure functions, and by considering homogeneity\r
groups that are “sufficiently non-abelian” so that none of the coefficients of\r
the relevant exponentials vanish (Bianchi types VIII and IX for d = 3, other\r
homogeneity groups for d > 3 - see [31]). By contrast, inspection of (6.13)\r
and (6.14) reveals that the subleading terms not only lack manifest positivity,\r
but also do depend on spatial inhomogeneities via the spatial gradient of the\r
structure functions, and the first and second spatial derivatives of the scale\r
42

factors. It is quite intriguing that the associated walls are lightlike, unlike\r
the walls associated with the leading terms all of which are timelike. Terms\r
involving lightlike walls will thus have to be taken into account in higher\r
orders of the BKL expansion. A Kac-Moody theoretic interpretation of this\r
fact was recently proposed in [28].\r
The computations in this subsection involve only the Cartan formulas.\r
They remain valid if in (4.8) we replace the one-forms dxi by some anholo\u0002nomic frame f\r
i = fi\r
j\r
(x)dxj. This modifies the Iwasawa frame {θ\r
a}, which\r
has no intrinsic geometrical meaning. The structure functions C\r
a\r
bc(x) of the\r
new frame get extra contributions from the spatial derivatives acting on f\r
i\r
.\r
In fact, for f\r
i = dxi not all gravitational walls αijk appear because from\r
(4.7) we then have C\r
d\r
bc = 0 for the top component (since θ\r
d = dxd\r
), and\r
C\r
d−1\r
bc = 0 b, c 6= d. Hence, the corresponding gravitational walls are absent.\r
To get all the gravitational walls, one therefore needs an anholonomic frame\r
f\r
i\r
. However, the dominant gravitational wall α1 d−1 d is always present, and\r
this is the one relevant for the billiard, when gravitational walls are relevant\r
at all.\r
6.3 p-form walls\r
While none of the wall forms considered so far involved the dilatons, the\r
electric and magnetic ones do as we shall now show. To make the notation\r
less cumbersome we will omit the super-(or sub-)script (p) on the p-form\r
fields in this subsection.\r
6.3.1 Electric walls\r
The electric potential density can be written as\r
V\r

Here the indices aj\r
’s are all distinct because E\r
a1···ap\r
is completely antisym\u0002metric. The variables E\r
a1···ap do not depend on the βµ\r
. It is thus rather easy\r
to take the BKL limit. The exponentials in (6.22) are multiplied by positive\r
factors which generically are different from zero. Thus, in the BKL limit,\r
V\r
el\r
(p)\r
becomes\r
V\r
el\r

a1<a2<···<ap\r
Θ[−2ea1···ap(β)]. (6.25)\r
The transformation from the variables (N a\r

i\r

However, it is easy to see that these extra terms do not affect the symmetry\r
walls in the BKL limit.\r
6.3.2 Magnetic walls\r
The magnetic potential is dealt with similarly. Expressing it in the {θ\r
a}-\r
frame, one obtains\r
V\r
magn\r
(p) =\r
1\r
2 (p + 1)!\r

where again all aj\r
’s are distinct. One sometimes rewrites ma1···ap+1 (β) as\r
m˜ ap+2···ad, where {ap+2, ap+3, · · · , ad} is the set complementary to {a1, a2, · · · ap+1};\r
e.g.,\r
m˜ 1 2 ··· d−p−1 = β\r
1 + · · · + βd−p−1 +\r
λp\r
2\r
φ = md−p ··· d (6.30)\r
Of course, the components of the exterior derivative F of A in the non\u0002holonomic frame {θ\r
a} involves the structure coefficients, i.e. Fa1···ap+1 =\r
∂[a1Aa2···ap+1] + CA-terms where ∂a ≡ N i\r
a∂i\r
is the frame derivative.\r
Again, the BKL limit is quite simple and yields (assuming generic mag\u0002netic fields)\r
V\r
magn\r
(p) ≃\r
X\r
a1<···<ad−p−1\r
Θ[−2ba1···ad−p−1(β)]. (6.31)\r
Just as the off-diagonal variables, the electric and magnetic fields freeze in the\r
BKL limit since the Hamiltonian no longer depends on the p-form variables.\r
These drop out because one can rescale the coefficient of any Θ-function to\r
be one (when it is not zero), thereby absorbing the dependence on the p-form\r
variables.\r
The scale factors are therefore constrained by the further “billiard” con\u0002ditions\r
ea1···ap(β) ≥ 0, m˜ a1···ad−p−1(β) ≥ 0. (6.32)\r
The hyperplanes ea1···ap(β) = 0 and ˜ma1···ad−p−1(β) = 0 are called “electric”\r
and “magnetic” walls, respectively. Both walls are timelike because their\r
gradients are spacelike, with squared norm\r
p(d − p − 1)\r
d − 1\r
+\r
\u0010λp\r
2\r
\u00112\r
> 0 (6.33)\r
(For D = 11 supergravity, we have d = 10, p = 3 and λp = 0 and thus the\r
norm is equal to +2). This equality explicitly shows the invariance of the\r
norms of the p-form walls under electric-magnetic duality.\r
6.4 Walls due to dilatons or to a cosmological constant\r
The fact that the leading walls originating from the centrifugal, gravitational\r
and p-form or are all timelike, is an important ingredient of the overall BKL\r
picture. As we saw above, however, there exist subleading contributions in\r
45

the gravitational potential whose associated wall forms are lightlike. Such is\r
the case also for the dilaton contribution\r
Vφ = ggij∂iφ∂jφ, (6.34)\r
which has the same form as the subleading gravitational walls, since the\r
exponentials that control its asymptotic behaviour are easily seen to be\r
exp[−2µa(β)]. Consequently, at least to leading order, we can neglect Vφ\r
in the BKL limit.\r
The only example of a spacelike wall that we know of is the cosmological\r
constant term (in its weight-2 form)\r
VΛ = Λg = Λ exp h− 2\r
X\r
a\r
β\r
a\r
i\r
(6.35)\r
When Λ is positive (de Sitter sign) the spacelike wall (6.35) is repulsive.\r
Depending on the initial conditions – which set the scale – this wall either\r
prevents the system from reaching the BKL small volume regime or does not\r
prevent the collapse. In the first case, the spacelike wall acts as a “barrier” to\r
the motion of the billiard ball, and the reflection against it forces the billiard\r
ball to run “backwards in β-time” in the direction of increasing spatial volume\r
(this is analogous to the bounce in the (global) de Sitter solution, which is a\r
hyperboloid — a sphere that first contracts and then expands). In the second\r
case, the billiard ball is already “beyond the barrier”, and the presence of\r
the spacelike wall has only a subdominant effect on its motion. In the BKL\r
picture it quickly becomes negligible: the cosmological potential Λg tends to\r
zero as g goes to zero. When Λ is negative (Anti-de Sitter sign) the spacelike\r
wall (3.37) is attractive and tends to favour collapse. It, however, quickly\r
becomes negligible in the BKL limit.\r
6.5 Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills couplings\r
The addition of Chern-Simons terms, Yang-Mills or Chapline-Manton cou\u0002plings does not bring in new (asymptotically relevant) walls. The only change\r
in the asymptotic dynamics is a modification of the constraints.\r
For Yang-Mills couplings, the contribution to the energy density from the\r
Yang-Mills field takes the same form as for a collection of abelian 1-forms,\r
with the replacement of the momenta π\r
i by the Yang-Mills momenta πi\r
a\r
(where a = 1, · · · , N and N is the dimension of the internal Lie algebra) and\r
46

of the magnetic fields by the corresponding non-abelian field strengths. As\r
their abelian counterparts, these do not involve the scale factors β\r
µ\r
. Because\r
of this key property, the same analysis goes through. Each electric and\r
magnetic 1-form wall is simply repeated a number of times equal to the\r
dimension of the Lie algebra. Gauss law is, however, modified and reads\r
Diπ\r
i\r
a ≡ ∇iπ\r
i\r
a + f\r
b\r
acπ\r
i\r
bA\r
c\r
i = 0. (6.36)\r
Here, ∇iis the standard metric covariant derivative. Similarly, the momen\u0002tum constraints are modified and involves the non-abelian field strengths.\r
The discussion of Chapline-Manton couplings or Chern-Simons terms pro\u0002ceeds in the same way. The energy-density of the p-forms has the same de\u0002pendence on the scale factors as in the absence of couplings, i.e., provides\r
the same exponentials. The only difference is that the wall coefficients are\r
different functions of the p-form canonical variables; but this difference is\r
again washed out in the sharp wall limit, where the coefficients can be re\u0002placed by one (provided they are different from zero). The momentum and\r
Gauss constraints are genuinely different and impose different conditions on\r
the initial data.\r
Nevertheless, the Chern-Simons terms may play a more significant rˆole in\r
peculiar contexts when only specialized field configurations are considered.\r
This occurs for instance in [58], where it is shown that the D = 11 super\u0002gravity Chern-Simons term for spatially homogeneous metrics and magnetic\r
fields may constrain some electromagnetic walls to disappear “accidentally”.\r
This changes the finite volume billiard to one of infinite volume.\r
7 Cosmological billiards\r
Let us summarize our findings. The dynamics in the vicinity of a space\u0002like singularity is governed by the scale factors, while the other variables\r
(off-diagonal metric components, p-form fields) tend to become mere “spec\u0002tators” which get asymptotically frozen. This simple result is most easily\r
derived in terms of the hyperbolic polar coordinates (ρ, γ), and in the gauge\r
(2.5). In this picture, the essential dynamics is carried by the angular vari\u0002ables γ which move on a fixed billiard table, with cushions defined by the\r
dominant walls wA′(γ). However, it is often geometrically more illuminat\u0002ing to “unproject” this billiard motion in the full Minkowski space of the\r
extended scale factors β\r
µ\r
. In that picture, the asymptotic evolution of the\r
47

scale factors at each spatial point reduces to a zigzag of null straight lines\r
w.r.t. the metric Gµνdβµdβν. The straight segments of this motion are in\u0002terrupted by collisions against the sharp walls\r
wA(β) ≡ wAµβ\r
µ = 0 (7.1)\r
defined by the symmetry, gravitational and p-form potentials, respectively.\r
As we showed all these walls are timelike, i.e. they have spacelike gradients:\r
G\r
µνwAµwAν > 0 (7.2)\r
Indeed, the gradients of the symmetry and gravitational wall forms have\r
squared norm equal to +2, independently of the dimension d. By contrast,\r
the norms of the electric and magnetic gradients, which are likewise positive,\r
depend on the model. As we saw, there also exist subdominant walls, which\r
can be neglected as they are located “behind” the dominant walls.\r
In the β-space picture, the free motion before a collision is described by\r
a null straight line of the type of (3.21), with the constraint (3.22). The\r
effect of a collision on a particular wall wA(β) is easily obtained by solving\r
(5.31), or (5.32), with only one term in the sum. This dynamics is exactly\r
integrable: it suffices to decompose the motion of the β-particle into two\r
(linear) components: (i) the component parallel to the (timelike) wall hyper\u0002plane, and (ii) the orthogonal component. One easily finds that the parallel\r
motion is left unperturbed by the presence of the wall, while the orthogonal\r
motion suffers a (one-dimensional) reflection, with a change of the sign of the\r
outgoing orthogonal velocity with respect to the ingoing one. The net effect\r
of the collision on a certain wall w(β) then is to change the ingoing velocity\r
vector v\r
µ\r
entering the ingoing free motion (3.21) into an outgoing velocity\r
vector v\r
′µ given (in any linear frame) by the usual formula for a geometric\r
reflection in the hyperplane w(β) = 0:\r
v\r
′µ = vµ − 2\r
(w · v)w\r
µ\r
(w · w)\r
. (7.3)\r
Here, all scalar products, and index raisings, are done with the β-space metric\r
Gµν. Note that the collision law (7.3) leaves invariant the (Minkowski) length\r
of the vector v\r
µ\r
. Because the dominant walls are timelike, the geometric\r
reflections that the velocities undergo during a collision, are elements of the\r
orthochronous Lorentz group. Each reflection preserves the norm and the\r
time-orientation; hence, the velocity vector remains null and future-oriented.\r
48

From this perspective, we can also better understand the relevance of\r
walls which are not timelike. Lightlike walls (like some of the subleading\r
gravitational walls) can never cause reflections because in order to hit them\r
the billiard ball would have to move at superluminal speeds in violation of the\r
Hamiltonian constraint. The effect of spacelike walls (like the cosmological\r
constant wall) is again different: they are either irrelevant (if they are “be\u0002hind the motion”), or otherwise they reverse the time-orientation inducing a\r
motion towards increasing spatial volume (“bounce”).\r
The hyperbolic billiard is obtained from the β-space picture by a radial\r
projection onto the unit hyperboloid of the piecewise straight motion in the\r
polywedge defined by the walls. The straight motion thereby becomes a\r
geodesic motion on hyperbolic space. The “cushions” of the hyperbolic bil\u0002liard table are the intersections of the hyperplanes (7.1) with the unit hy\u0002perboloid, such that the billiard motion is constrained to be in the region\r
defined as the intersection of the half-spaces wA(β) ≥ 0 with the unit hyper\u0002boloid. As we already emphasized, not all walls are relevant since some of the\r
inequalities wA(β) ≥ 0 are implied by others [26]. Only the dominant wall\r
forms, in terms of which all the other wall forms can be expressed as linear\r
combinations with non-negative coefficients, are relevant for determining the\r
billiard. Usually, these are the minimal symmetry walls and some of the p\u0002form walls. The billiard region, as a subset of hyperbolic space, is in general\r
non-compact because the cushions meet at infinity (i.e. at a cusp); in terms\r
of the original scale factor variables β, this means that the corresponding\r
hyperplanes intersect on the lightcone. It is important that, even when the\r
billiard is non-compact, the hyperbolic region can have finite volume.\r
Given the action (2.1) with definite spacetime dimension, menu of fields\r
and dilaton couplings, one can determine the relevant wall forms and compute\r
the billiards. For generic initial conditions, we have the following results, as\r
to which of the models (2.1) exhibit oscillatory behaviour (finite volume\r
billiard) or Kasner-like behaviour (infinite volume billiard)\r
• Pure gravity billiards have finite volume for spacetime dimension D ≤\r
10 and infinite volume for spacetime dimension D ≥ 11 [33]. This can\r
be understood in terms of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra [27]: as\r
shown there, the system is chaotic precisely if the underlying indefinite\r
Kac-Moody algebra is hyperbolic.\r
• The billiard of gravity coupled to a dilaton always has infinite volume,\r
hence exhibits Kasner-like behavior [5, 2, 29].\r
49

• If gravity is coupled to p-forms (with p 6= 0 and p < D − 2) with\u0002out a dilaton the corresponding billiard has a finite volume [25]. The\r
most prominent example in this class is D = 11 supergravity, whereas\r
vacuum gravity in 11 dimensions is Kasner-like. The 3-form is crucial\r
for closing the billiard. Similarly, the Einstein-Maxwell system in four\r
(in fact any number of) dimensions has a finite-volume billiard (see\r
[60, 75, 99] for a discussion of four-dimensional homogeneous models\r
with Maxwell fields exhibiting oscillatory behaviour).\r
• The volume of the mixed Einstein-dilaton-p-form system depends on\r
the dilaton couplings. For a given spacetime dimension D and a given\r
menu of p-forms there exists a subcritical domain D in the space of\r
the dilaton couplings, i.e. an open neighbourhood of the origin λp = 0\r
such that: (i) when the dilaton couplings λp belong to D the general\r
behaviour is Kasner-like, but (ii) when the λp do not belong to D\r
the behaviour is oscillatory [24, 29]. For all the superstring models,\r
the dilaton couplings do not belong to the subcritical domain and the\r
billiard has finite volume. Note, however, that the superstring dilaton\r
couplings are precisely “critical”, i.e. on the borderline between the\r
subcritical and the overcritical domain.\r
As a note of caution let us point out that some indicators of chaos must\r
be used with care in general relativity, because of reparametrization invari\u0002ance, and in particular redefinitions of the time coordinate; see [18, 54] for a\r
discussion of the original Bianchi IX model.\r
We next discuss the link between the various time coordinates used in\r
the analysis. When working in the gauge (2.5), the basic time coordinate\r
is T. Let us see how the other time coordinates depend on T. First, we\r
note that the dynamical variable λ is asymptotically a linear function of T.\r
Indeed, its conjugate momentum πλ < 0 is asymptotically constant, so that\r
the integration of dλ/dT = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλ yields\r
λ = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλT + const. (7.4)\r
Hence ρ is an exponential function of T:\r
ρ = exp λ ∝ exp(−\r
1\r
2\r
πλT) (7.5)\r
From this behavior we infer the time dependence of the intermediate time\r
coordinate τ by integrating its defining relation dτ = ρ\r
2dT = −(2/πλ)ρ2dλ =\r
50

−(2/πλ)ρdρ. This yields\r
τ = −(1/πλ)ρ\r
2 + const. (7.6)\r
At this stage, the asymptotic links between T, τ, λ and ρ are similar to the\r
results derived above for a Kasner solution and does not depend on whether\r
the system is chaotic or non-chaotic.\r
The situation is more subtle for the proper time t in the chaotic case\r
(in the non-chaotic case where one settles in a Kasner regime after a finite\r
number of collisions, nothing is changed, of course). The proper time is\r
obtained by integrating\r
dt =\r
√\r
gdτ =\r
√\r
gρ2\r
dT = −(2/πλ)\r
√\r
gρdρ. (7.7)\r
The main term in the integrand is √g = exp(−ρσ), where σ ≡ Σiγ\r
i\r
. The\r
quantity σ oscillates chaotically and is difficult to control. As argued in [69],\r
however, one nevertheless gets (in the four-dimensional case) the usual Kas\u0002ner relation √g ∼ t (and thus τ ∼ ln t and T ∼ ln | ln t|) up to subdominant\r
corrections. We refer the interested reader to [69] for the details.\r
Concerning the frequency of collisions, note that the billiard picture\r
makes it clear that the typical time interval between two collisions is con\u0002stant as a function of T. In other words, the number of collisions goes like\r
λ ≈\r
1\r
2\r
ln τ ∼ ln | ln t|.\r
The hyperbolic billiard description of the (3+1)-dimensional homoge\u0002neous Bianchi IX system was first worked out by Chitre [17] and Misner\r
[84]. It was subsequently generalized to inhomogeneous metrics in [71, 56].\r
The extension to higher dimensions with perfect fluid sources was considered\r
in [73], without symmetry walls. Exterior p-form sources were investigated\r
in [57, 58] for special classes of metric and p-form configurations. As far as\r
we know, however, the uniform approach used in the present paper based on\r
a systematic use of the Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric is new.\r
8 Kac-Moody theoretic formulation\r
Although the billiard description holds for all systems governed by the ac\u0002tion (2.1), the billiard in general has no notable regularity property. In\r
particular, the dihedral angles between the faces, which can depend on the\r
(continuous) dilaton couplings, need not be integer submultiples of π. In\r
51

some instances, however, the billiard can be identified with the fundamental\r
Weyl chamber of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody (or KM) algebra of indefi\u0002nite type9\r
, with Lorentzian signature metric [26, 27, 23]. Such billiards are\r
called “Kac-Moody billiards”. More specifically, in [26], superstring models\r
were considered and the rank 10 KM algebras E10 and BE10 were shown to\r
emerge, in line with earlier conjectures made in [62, 64]10. This result was\r
further extended to pure gravity in any number of spacetime dimensions, for\r
which the relevant KM algebra is AEd, and it was understood that chaos\r
(finite volume of the billiard) is equivalent to hyperbolicity of the underlying\r
Kac-Moody algebra [27]. For pure gravity in D = 4 the relevant algebra\r
is the hyperbolic algebra AE3 first investigated in [38]. Further examples\r
of emergence of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras, based on the models of\r
[13, 21], are given in [23].\r
The main feature of the gravitational billiards that can be associated\r
with KM algebras is that there exists a group theoretical interpretation of\r
the billiard motion: the asymptotic BKL dynamics is equivalent (in a sense to\r
be made precise below), at each spatial point, to the asymptotic dynamics of\r
a one-dimensional nonlinear σ-model based on a certain infinite dimensional\r
coset space G/K, where the KM group G and its maximal compact subgroup\r
K depend on the specific model. As we have seen, the walls that determine\r
the billiards are the dominant walls. For KM billiards, they correspond\r
to the simple roots of the KM algebra. Some of the subdominant walls\r
also have an algebraic interpretation in terms of higher-height positive roots.\r
This enables one to go beyond the BKL limit and to see the beginnings of\r
a possible identification of the dynamics of the scale factors and of all the\r
remaining variables with that of a non-linear σ-model defined on the cosets\r
of the Kac-Moody group divided its maximal compact subgroup [28].\r
The KM theoretic reformulation will not only enable us to give a unified\r
group theoretical derivation of the different types of walls discussed in the\r
preceding section, but also shows that the β-space of logarithmic scale fac\u0002tors, in which the billard motion takes place, can be identified with the Cartan\r
subalgebra of the underlying indefinite Kac-Moody algebra. The various types\r
of walls can thus be understood directly as arising from the large field limit\r
of the corresponding σ-models. It is the presence of gravity, which comes\r
9Throughout this chapter, we will use the abbreviations “KM” for “Kac-Moody”, and\r
“CSA” for Cartan subalgebra.\r
10Note that the Weyl groups of the E-family have been discussed in a similar vein in\r
the context of U-duality [79, 89, 3].\r
52

with a metric in scale-factor space of Lorentzian signature, which forces us\r
to consider infinite dimensional groups if we want to recover all the walls\r
found in our previous analysis, and this is the main reason we need the the\u0002ory of KM algebras. For finite dimensional Lie algebras we obtain only a\r
subset of the walls: one of the cushions of the associated billiard is missing,\r
and one always ends up with a monotonic Kasner-type behavior in the limit\r
t → 0\r
+ (for instance, the non-diagonal Kasner solution discussed in chapter 4\r
has only symmetry walls corresponding to the finite dimensional coset space\r
GL(d, R)/SO(d)). The absence of chaotic oscillations for models based on\r
finite dimensional Lie groups is consistent with the classical integrability of\r
these models. While they remain formally integrable for infinite dimensional\r
KM groups, one can understand the chaotic behavior as resulting from the\r
projection of a motion in an infinite dimensional space onto a finite dimen\u0002sional subspace.\r
Before proceeding we should like to emphasize that the equivalence be\u0002tween the models discussed in the foregoing sections and the KM σ-models\r
to be presented in this section has so far only been established, in the case\r
of general models, for their asymptotic dynamics. A proposal relating the\r
infinitely many off-diagonal degrees of freedom arising in the KM σ-model\r
to spatial gradients of the metric and other fields, as well as possibly other\r
degrees of freedom has recently been made in [28]. The first steps of this\r
proposal have been explicitly checked for the relation between D = 11 su\u0002pergravity and the E10 σ-model. The relevance of non-linear σ-models for\r
uncovering the symmetries of M-theory has also been discussed from a dif\u0002ferent, spacetime-covariant point of view in [100, 95, 96], but there it is E11\r
rather than E10 that has been proposed as a fundamental symmetry.\r
8.1 Some basic facts about KM algebras\r
We first summarize some basic results from the theory of KM algebras, refer\u0002ring the reader to [66, 85] for comprehensive treatments. As explained there,\r
every KM algebra g ≡ g(A) is defined by means of an integer-valued Cartan\r
matrix A and a set of generators and relations [66, 85]. We shall assume that\r
the Cartan matrix is symmetrizable since this is the case encountered for cos\u0002mological billiards. The Cartan matrix can then be written as (i, j = 1, . . . r,\r
53

with r denoting the rank of g(A))\r
Aij =\r
2hαi|αj i\r
hαi|αii\r
(8.1)\r
where {αi} is a set of r simple roots, and where the angular brackets denote\r
the invariant symmetric bilinear form of g(A) [66]. Here the bilinear form\r
acts on the roots, which are linear forms on the Cartan subalgebra (CSA)\r
h ⊂ g(A). The generators, which are also referred to as Chevalley-Serre\r
generators, consist of triples {hi, ei, fi} with i = 1, . . . , r, and for each i form\r
an sl(2, R) subalgebra. The CSA h is then spanned by the elements hi, so\r
that\r
[hi, hj] = 0 (8.2)\r
Furthermore,\r
[ei, fj] = δijhj (8.3)\r
and\r
[hi, ej] = Aijej, [hi, fj] = −Aijfj (8.4)\r
so that the value of the linear form αj, corresponding to the raising operator\r
ej, on the element hi of the preferred basis {hi} of h is αj (hi) = Aij . More\r
abstractly, and independently of the choice of any basis in the CSA, the roots\r
appear as eigenvalues of the adjoint action of any element h of the CSA on the\r
raising (ei) or lowering (fi) generators: [h, ei] = +αi(h)ei, [h, fi] = −αi(h)fi.\r
Last but not least we have the so-called Serre relations\r
ad (ei)\r
1−Aij (ej ) = 0 , ad (fi)1−Aij (fj ) = 0 (8.5)\r
Every KM algebra possesses the triangular decomposition\r
g(A) = n\r
− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ (8.6)\r
where n\r
+ and n−, respectively, are spanned by the multiple commutators of\r
the ei and fi which do not vanish on account of the Serre relations and the\r
Jacobi identity. To be completely precise, n\r
+ is the quotient of the free Lie\r
algebra generated by the ei’s by the ideal generated by the Serre relations\r
(idem for n\r
− and fi). In more mundane terms, when the algebra is realized, in\r
a suitable basis, by infinite dimensional matrices, n\r
+ and n− simply consist\r
of the “nilpotent” matrices with nonzero entries only above or below the\r
diagonal. Exponentiating them formally, one obtains infinite dimensional\r
54

matrices again with nonzero entries above or below the diagonal, and 1’s on\r
the diagonal – as exemplified in the finite dimensional case by the matrices\r
N in chapter 4.\r
One of the main results of the theory is that, for positive definite A,\r
one just recovers from these relations Cartan’s list of finite dimensional Lie\r
algebras (see e.g. [53] for a clear introduction). For non positive-definite A,\r
on the other hand, the associated KM algebras are infinite dimensional. If\r
A has only one zero eigenvalue (with all other eigenvalues strictly positive)\r
one obtains the so-called affine algebras, whose structure and properties are\r
rather well understood [66, 47]. For indefinite A (i.e. at least one negative\r
eigenvalue of A), on the other hand, very little is known, and it remains an\r
outstanding problem to find a manageable representation for them [66, 85]\r
(see also [44] for a physicist’s introduction). In particular, there is not a\r
single example of an indefinite KM algebra for which the root multiplicities,\r
i.e. the number of Lie algebra elements associated with a given root, are\r
known in closed form. The scarcity of results is even more acute for the\r
“Kac-Moody groups” obtained by formal exponentiation of the associated\r
Lie algebras. In spite of these caveats, we will proceed formally, making sure\r
that our definitions reduce to the standard formulas in the truncation to\r
finite dimensional Lie groups, and more generally remain well defined when\r
we restrict the number of degrees of freedom to any finite subset.\r
In the remainder we will thus assume A to be Lorentzian, i.e. non\u0002degenerate and indefinite, with one negative eigenvalue. We shall see that\r
this choice is physically motivated by the fact that the negative eigenvalue\r
can be associated with the conformal factor which, as we saw, is the one\r
degree of freedom making the reduced Einstein action unbounded from be\u0002low. As a special, and important case, this class of Lorentzian KM algebras\r
includes hyperbolic KM algebras whose Cartan matrices are such that the\r
deletion of any node from the Dynkin diagram leaves either a finite or an\r
affine subalgebra, or a disjoint union of them.\r
The “maximal compact” subalgebra k is defined as the invariant subalge\u0002bra of g(A) under the standard Chevalley involution, i.e.\r
θ(x) = x for all x ∈ k (8.7)\r
with\r
θ(hi) = −hi, θ(ei) = −fi, θ(fi) = −ei (8.8)\r
More explicitly, it is the subalgebra generated by multiple commutators of\r
(ei − fi). For finite dimensional g(A), the inner product induced on the\r
55

maximal compact subalgebra k is negative-definite, and the orthogonal com\u0002plement to k has a positive definite inner product. This is not so, however,\r
for indefinite A (see the footnote on page 438 of [65]).\r
It will be convenient in the following to introduce the operation of trans\u0002position acting on any Lie algebra element E as\r
E\r
T\r
:= −θ(E) (8.9)\r
In this notation the relations above become h\r
T\r
i = hi\r
, eT\r
i = fi\r
, f T\r
i = ei\r
, and the\r
subalgebra k is generated by the “anti-symmetric” elements satisfying E\r
T =\r
−E. After exponentiation, the elements of the corresponding maximally\r
compact subgroup K formally appear as “orthogonal matrices” obeying k\r
T =\r
k\r
−1\r
.\r
Sometimes it is convenient to use a so-called Cartan-Weyl basis for g(A).\r
Using Greek indices µ, ν, . . . to label the root components corresponding to\r
an arbitrary basis Hµ in the CSA, with the usual summation convention and\r
a Lorentzian metric Gµν for an indefinite g, we have hi:= α\r
µ\r
i Hµ, where\r
α\r
µ\r
i\r
are the “contravariant components”, Gµνα\r
ν\r
i ≡ αi µ, of the simple roots\r
αi (i = 1, . . . r), which are linear forms on the CSA, with usual “covariant\r
components” defined as αi µ ≡ αi(Hµ).\r
To an arbitrary root α corresponds a set of Lie-algebra generators Eα,s,\r
where s = 1, . . . , mult (α) labels the (in general) multiple Lie-algebra ele\u0002ments associated with α. The root multiplicity mult (α) is always one for\r
finite dimensional Lie algebras, and is also one for the positive norm roots\r
α\r
2 ≡ hα|αi > 0 (i.e. the “real roots”) of general KM algebras (including, of\r
course, the simple roots), but generically exhibits exponential growth as a\r
function of −α\r
2\r
for indefinite A. In this notation, the remaining Chevalley\u0002Serre generators are given by ei\r
:= Eαiand fi:= E−αi. Then we have\r
[Hµ, Eα,s] = αµEα,s (8.10)\r
and\r
[Eα,s, Eα′\r
,t] = X\r
u\r
c\r
s,t,u\r
αα′ Eα+α′\r
,u (8.11)\r
The elements of the Cartan-Weyl basis are normalized such that\r
hHµ|Hνi = Gµν , hEα,s|Eβ,ti = δstδα+β,0 (8.12)\r
where we have assumed that the basis satisfies ET\r
α = E−α. Let us finally\r
recall that the Weyl group of a KM algebra is the discrete group generated\r
by reflections in the hyperplanes orthogonal to the simple roots.\r
56

8.2 Decomposition of AE3 into SL(3) representations\r
As a special example, let us consider the hyperbolic KM algebra AE3, with\r
Cartan matrix11\r
Aij =\r
\r
\r
2 −1 0\r
−1 2 −2\r
0 −2 2\r
\r
 (8.13)\r
and work out the first few terms of its decomposition into SL(3, R) repre\u0002sentations. This decomposition refers to the adjoint action of the sl(3, R)\r
subalgebra defined below on the complete KM algebra.\r
From the mathematical point of view, the algebra (8.13) was first studied\r
in [38] as it is the simplest hyperbolic KM algebra containing a non-trivial\r
affine subalgebra (see also [68] and references therein for more recent work).\r
From the physical perspective this algebra is of special interest for pure grav\u0002ity in four dimensions both because its regular subalgebras and its Chevalley\u0002Serre generators can be physically identified with known symmetry groups\r
arising in dimensional reductions of general relativity [86], and because its\r
Weyl chamber is related to the original BKL billiard [27] (see footnote 12).\r
First of all, the SL(2, R) subgroup corresponding to the third diagonal entry\r
of Aij can be identified with the Ehlers group [37] which acts on solutions\r
of Einstein’s equations with one Killing vector. The affine subgroup corre\u0002sponding to the submatrix\r
\u0012\r
2 −2\r
−2 2 \u0013\r
(8.14)\r
is the Geroch group acting on solutions of Einstein’s equations with two com\u0002muting Killing vectors [42] (axisymmetric stationary, or colliding plane wave\r
solutions, respectively), see e.g. [62, 63, 12, 87] and references therein. Both\r
the Ehlers group and the Geroch group act in part by nonlocal transforma\u0002tions on the metric (or vierbein) components.\r
A crucial role, in our analysis, is played by the SL(3, R) subgroup gener\u0002ated by (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2), corresponding to the submatrix\r
\u0012\r
2 −1\r
−1 2 \u0013\r
(8.15)\r
11This algebra is also called F [38], H3 [66], HA(1)\r
1\r
[68] or A∧∧\r
1\r
[27].\r
57

This group can be realized as acting on the spatial components of the metric\r
(or vierbein), as an extension of the so-called Matzner-Misner SL(2, R) group\r
for solutions with two commuting Killing vectors.\r
The billiard picture for pure gravity in four dimensions can be readily\r
understood in terms of the Weyl group of AE3 [27]. For SL(3, R), which\r
has two simple roots, the Weyl group is the permutation group on three\r
objects. The two hyperplanes orthogonal to the simple roots of SL(3, R) can\r
be identified with the symmetry walls encountered in section 6.1. The third\r
simple root extending (8.15) to the full rank 3 algebra (8.13), which “closes\r
off” the billiard, can then be identified with curvature wall orthogonal to\r
α123 [27]. Readers may indeed check that the scalar products between the\r
two symmetry wall forms and the curvature wall form reproduce the above\r
Cartan matrix12.\r
Let us now expand the nilpotent subalgebra n\r
+ in terms of representations\r
of the A2 ≡ sl(3, R) subalgebra of AE3 exhibited in (8.15). For this purpose,\r
given any root α, we define its sl(3, R) level ℓ to be the number of times the\r
root α3 appears in it, to wit\r
α = mα1 + nα2 + ℓα3 (8.16)\r
Note that this notion of level is different from the affine level (≡ m) which\r
counts the number of appearances of the over-extended root α1 [38]. The\r
hyperbolic algebra is thus decomposed into an infinite tower of irreducible\r
representations of its sl(3, R) subalgebra. Such a decomposition is simpler\r
than one in terms of the affine subalgebra, whose representation theory is\r
far more complicated (and, unlike that of sl(3, R), only incompletely under\u0002stood).\r
After inclusion of the third Cartan generator h3, the level ℓ = 0 sector\r
is just a gl(3, R) subalgebra with generators Ki\r
j (where i, j = 1, 2, 3) and\r
commutation relations\r

, Kk\r

j (8.17)\r
12 Note that in the original analysis of [6, 8, 17, 84], the symmetry walls are not included;\r
the KM algebra that arises has the 3 × 3 Cartan matrix\r
Aij =\r
\r
\r
2 −2 −2\r
−2 2 −2\r
−2 −2 2\r
\r
\r
and its fundamental Weyl chamber (radially projected on the hyperbolic plane H2) is the\r
ideal equilateral triangle having its three vertices at infinity.\r
58

These Lie algebra elements will be seen to generate the GL(3, R) group act\u0002ing on the spatial components of the vierbein. The restriction of the AE3-\r
invariant bilinear form to the level-0 sector is\r

The identification with the Chevalley-Serre generators is\r
e1 = K1\r
2 , f1 = K21 , h1 = K11 − K22\r
e2 = K2\r
3 , f2 = K32 , h2 = K22 − K33\r
h3 = −K1\r
1 − K22 + K33 (8.19)\r
manifestly showing how the over-extended CSA generator h3 enlarges the\r
original sl(3, R) generated by (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2) to the Lie algebra\r
gl(3, R). The CSA generators are related to the “central charge” generator\r
c by\r
c = h2 + h3 = −K1\r
1 (8.20)\r
This is indeed the expected result: in the reduction of gravity to two dimen\u0002sions (i.e. with two commuting Killing vectors), the central charge does not\r
act on the internal degrees of freedom, but as a scaling on the conformal\r
factor [63, 12, 87] (here realized as the 1-1 component of the vierbein). The\r
affine level counting operator d is given by [38]\r
d = h1 + h2 + h3 = −K2\r
2 (8.21)\r
and in contradistinction to c it does act on the internal volume in the reduc\u0002tion to two dimensions (i.e. the “dilaton” ρ in the notation of [12, 87]). The\r
operator d may be viewed as the L0 operator of a full Witt-Virasoro algebra\r
enlarging the Geroch group via a semidirect product [65].\r
The irreducible representations of SL(3, R) are most conveniently charac\u0002terized by their Dynkin labels. Let us recall that these labels are non-negative\r
integers which characterize any highest-weight representation of any finite\u0002dimensional Lie algebra. Let us consider a representation with maximal\r
vector vΛ, of (highest) weight Λ, i.e. such that for any element h in the\r
CSA, h(vΛ) = Λ(h)vΛ, where the Lie algebra acts on the representation vec\u0002tor space (or “module”), and where Λ is a linear form on the CSA. The\r
Dynkin labels of this representation are defined as pi(Λ) ≡ 2hαi|Λi/hαi|αii,\r
where αi are simple roots of the Lie algebra under consideration.Note that\r
59

in the case of simply laced algebras such as sl(3, R), and AE3, the simple\r
roots have all a squared length equal to 2, so that the definition of the labels\r
reduces to pi(Λ) = hαi|Λi (while the Cartan matrix similarly simplifies to\r
Aij = hαi|αj i). In the case of sl(3, R) we have two simple roots, α1 and α2,\r
and therefore two Dynkin labels: p1(Λ) = hα1|Λi, p2(Λ) = hα2|Λi. In terms\r
of the Young tableau description of sl(3, R) representations, the first Dynkin\r
label p1 counts the number of columns having two boxes, while p2 counts\r
the number of columns having only one box. For instance, (p1, p2) = (1, 0)\r
labels an antisymmetric two-index tensor, while (p1, p2) = (0, 2) denotes a\r
symmetric two-index tensor. Note also that the dimension of the sl(3, R) rep\u0002resentation described by the labels (p1, p2) is (p1 + 1)(p2 + 1)(p1 + p2 + 2)/2.\r
Let us determine the representations of sl(3, R) appearing at the first level\r
(ℓ = 1) of AE3\r
13 At this level, one sees that, under the adjoint action of\r
sl(3, R), i.e. of (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2), the extra Chevalley-Serre generator\r
f3 is a maximal vector. Indeed,\r
e1(f3) ≡ [e1, f3] = 0\r
e2(f3) ≡ [e2, f3] = 0 (8.22)\r
The weight of f3 is Λ = −α3 because, by definition h(f3) ≡ [h, f3] =\r
−α3(h)f3. Hence the Dynkin labels of the representation built on the maxi\u0002mal vector f3 are pi = −hαi\r
|α3i = −Ai3 with i = 1, 2. Explicitly, this gives\r
(p1, p2) = (0, 2). These labels also show up as the eigenvalues of the actions of\r
the (specially normalized) Cartan generators (h1, h2) on the maximal vector\r
f3, namely:\r
h1(f3) ≡ [h1, f3] = 0\r
h2(f3) ≡ [h2, f3] = 2f3 (8.23)\r
As we said above, the representation (p1, p2) = (0, 2) corresponds to a sym\u0002metric (two-index) tensor.\r
Thus, at the levels ±1 we have AE3 generators which can be represented\r
as symmetric tensors E\r
ij = Eji and Fij = Fji. One verifies that all algebra\r
relations are satisfied with (a(ij) ≡ (aij + aji)/2)\r

As one proceeds to higher levels, the classification of SL(3, R) represen\u0002tations becomes rapidly more complicated due to the exponential increase\r
in the number of representations with level ℓ. Generally, the representations\r
that can occur at level ℓ + 1 must be contained in the product of the level-ℓ\r
representations with the level-one representation (0, 2). Working out these\r
products is elementary, but cumbersome. Moreover, many of the represen\u0002tations constructed in this way will drop out (i.e. not appear as elements of\r
the AE3 Lie algebra). The complications are not yet visible at low levels;\r
for instance, the level-two generator Eab|jk ≡ ε\r
abiEi\r
jk, with labels (1, 2), is\r
straightforwardly obtained by commuting two level-one elements\r
[E\r
ij , Ekl] = εmk(iEm\r
j)l + ε\r
ml(iEm\r
j)k\r
(8.26)\r
A more economical way to sift the relevant representations is to work out\r
the relation between Dynkin labels and the associated highest weights, using\r
the fact that the highest weights of the adjoint representation are the roots.\r
More precisely, the maximal vectors being (as exemplified above at level 1) of\r
the “lowering type”, the corresponding highest weights are negative roots, say\r
Λ = −α with α of the form (8.16) with non-negative integers ℓ, m, n. Working\r
out the Dynkin labels of Λ = −α by computing, the scalar products with the\r
two simple roots of sl(3, R) then yields\r
p1 ≡ p = n − 2m , p2 ≡ q = 2ℓ + m − 2n (8.27)\r
As indicated, we shall henceforth use the notation (p1, p2) ≡ (p, q) for the\r
Dynkin labels. This formula is restrictive because all the integers entering it\r
must be non-negative.\r
Inverting this relation we get\r
m =\r
2\r
3\r
ℓ −\r
2\r
3\r
p −\r
1\r
3\r

n =\r

3\r
ℓ −\r
1\r
3\r
p −\r
2\r
3\r
q (8.28)\r
with n ≥ 2m ≥ 0. A further restriction derives from the fact that the highest\r
weight must be a root of AE3, viz. its square must be smaller or equal to 2:\r
Λ\r
2 =\r
2\r
3\r
(p\r
2 + q2 + pq − ℓ2\r
) ≤ 2 (8.29)\r

Consequently, the representations occurring at level ℓ must belong to the\r
list of all the solutions of (8.28) which are such that the labels m, n, p, q are\r
non-negative integers and the highest weight Λ is a root, i.e. Λ2 ≤ 2. These\r
simple diophantine equations/inequalities can be easily evaluated by hand\r
up to rather high levels.\r
However, the task is not finished. Although the above procedure sub\u0002stantially reduces the number of possibilities, it does not tell us how often\r
(including zero times!) a given representation appears (i.e. its outer multi\u0002plicity). For this purpose we have to make use of more detailed information\r
about AE3, namely the root multiplicities computed in [38, 66]. Matching\r
the combined weight diagrams with the root multiplicities listed in table H3\r
on page 215 of [66], we obtain the following representations in the decompo\u0002sition of AE3 w.r.t. its sl(3, R) subalgebra up to level ℓ ≤ 5:\r
ℓ = 1 → (p, q) = (0, 2)\r
ℓ = 2 → (p, q) = (1, 2)\r
ℓ = 3 → (p, q) = (2, 2)\r
(1, 1)\r
ℓ = 4 → (p, q) = (3, 2)\r
(1, 3)\r
(2, 1) (occurs twice)\r
(0, 2)\r
(1, 0)\r
ℓ = 5 → (p, q) = (4, 2)\r
(2, 3) (occurs twice)\r
(0, 4) (occurs twice)\r
(3, 1) (occurs three times)\r
(1, 2) (occurs four times)\r
(2, 0) (occurs three times)\r
(0, 1) (occurs twice) (8.30)\r
(we have not listed the representations compatible with (8.28) and (8.29),\r
which drop out, i.e. have outer multiplicity zero). Going to yet higher\r
levels will require knowledge of AE3 root multiplicities beyond those listed\r
in [38, 66, 68]. There is, however, an infinite set of admissible Dynkin labels\r
62

that can be readily identified by searching for “affine” highest weights for\r
which m = 0 in (8.16). They are\r
(p, q) = (ℓ − 1, 2) ⇐⇒ (m, n) = (0, ℓ − 1) (8.31)\r
Because the associated highest weights all obey Λ2 = 2 all these representa\u0002tions (and their “transposed” representations) appear with outer multiplicity\r
one independently of ℓ. A second series of affine representations is\r
(p, q) = (ℓ, 0) ⇐⇒ (m, n) = (0, ℓ) (8.32)\r
Now we have Λ2 = 0, and the corresponding representations have outer\r
multiplicity zero because the corresponding states are already contained as\r
lower weight states in the rperesentations (8.31).\r
The Lie algebra elements corresponding to (8.31) are thus given by the\r
two conjugate infinite towers of sl(3, R) representations (for ℓ = 1, 2, 3, . . .)\r
Ei1···iℓ−1\r
jk , Fi1···iℓ−1\r
jk (8.33)\r
The affine representations are distinguished because they contain the affine\r
subalgebra A\r
(1)\r
1 ⊂ AE3. This embedding was already studied in [38], but in\r
view of future applications and because the identification is a little subtle\r
we here spell out some more details. The affine subalgebra is identified by\r
requiring its elements to commute with the central charge c (8.20). ¿From\r
this requirement we infer that we must truncate the full algebra to the sub\u0002algebra generated by the elements Ki\r
j\r
for i, j ∈ {2, 3} and those generators\r
in (8.33) with i1 = . . . iℓ−1 = 1 and j, k ∈ {2, 3}. In physicists’ notation, the\r
affine subalgebra is spanned by the current algebra generators {T\r
−\r
m , T3m, T +m }\r
and the central charge c. The affine level m ∈ Z is the eigenvalue of the\r
affine level counting operator d: [d, Tm] = mTm. We therefore conclude that\r
the affine level zero sector14 consists of the generators of the Ehlers SL(2, R)\r
group, viz.\r
T\r
−\r
0 = f3 (≡ F33) , T30 = h3 , T +0 = e3 (≡ E\r
33) (8.34)\r
At affine level m = −1 we have\r
T\r

T\r

−1 = [e2, e3] = 2E\r

T\r
+\r
−1 = [[e2, e3], e3] = 2[E\r
23, E33] = 2E1\r
23 (8.35)\r
14Recall that the affine level m must not be confused with the level ℓ used in our\r
decomposition of AE3, cf. the definition (8.16).\r
63

Similarly, at affine level m = +1 we get\r
T\r
−\r
1 = [[f2, f3], f3] = 2[F23, F33] = 2F\r

T\r
+\r
1 = f2 (≡ K3\r
2) (8.36)\r
and so on for higher affine levels. The precise identification of the affine\r
subalgebra is of crucial importance for understanding the embedding of the\r
Geroch group into the full hyperbolic algebra.\r
Other cases of interest, where similar decompositions can be worked out\r
include the indefinite Kac-Moody algebras E10 and E11, both of which have\r
been conjectured to appear in D = 11 supergravity and M Theory, see [62,\r
64, 28], and [100], respectively. The first six rungs in the the sl(10, R) level\r
decomposition of E10 have been worked out in [28], and will be extended to\r
higher levels, as well as to E11, in [39].\r
8.3 Nonlinear σ-Models in one dimension\r
Notwithstanding the fact that we know even less about the “groups” asso\u0002ciated with indefinite KM algebras we will formulate nonlinear σ-models in\r
one time dimension and thereby provide an effective and unified description\r
of the asymptotic BKL dynamics for several physically important models.\r
The basic object of interest is a one-parameter dependent KM group ele\u0002ment V = V(t), which is assumed to be an element of the coset space G/K,\r
where G is the group obtained by formal exponentiation of the KM algebra\r
g, and K its maximal compact subgroup, which is again obtained by for\u0002mal exponentiation of the associated maximal compact subalgebra k defined\r
above. [In the “transpose” notation defined above, the group K is the group\r
of “orthogonal elements”: k\r
T = k−1\r
.] For finite dimensional g(A) our defini\u0002tions reduce to the usual ones, whereas for indefinite KM algebras they are\r
formal constructs to begin with. [Formal constructs similar to our objects V,\r
VV˙ −1, etc. have been used in somewhat different settings in [19, 20, 100].]\r
However, to ensure that our definitions are meaningful operationally, we will\r
make sure at every step that any finite truncation of the model is well defined\r
and can be worked out explicitly in a finite number of steps.\r
In physical terms, V can be thought of as an extension of the vielbein\r
of general relativity, with G and K as generalizations of the GL(d, R) and\r
local Lorentz symmetries of general relativity. For infinite dimensional G,\r
64

the object V thus becomes an “∞-bein”. It is then natural to associate to\r
this vielbein a “metric”, viz.\r
M := V\r
T V (8.37)\r
which is invariant under the left action ( V → kV) of the “Lorentz group” K\r
(actually the truncation of M to the relevant GL(n, R) subgroup of the KM\r
algebras entering the models we study turn out to correspond to the matrix\r
defined by the contravariant components, g\r
ij , of the spatial metric used in\r
section 4 above). Exploiting this invariance, we can formally bring V into a\r
“triangular gauge”\r
V = A · N =⇒ M = N\r
TA2N (8.38)\r
where the abelian part A belongs to the exponentiation of the CSA, and the\r
nilpotent part N to the exponentiation of n\r
+ thus recovering the formulas\r
which we already used in sections 4.1 and 4.2. This formal Iwasawa decom\u0002position, which is an infinite-dimensional generalization of the one we used\r
before, can be made fully explicit by decomposing A and N in terms of bases\r
of h and n\r
+:\r
A(t) = exp (β\r

N (t) = exp \u0010 X\r

where ∆+ denotes the set of positive roots. The components β\r

, parametriz\u0002ing a generic element in the CSA h, will turn out to be in direct correspon\u0002dence with the logarithmic scale factors β\r
µ = (βa\r
, φ) introduced in section 3.\r
We anticipated this correspondence by using the same notation. [As ex\u0002plained above, the apparently “wrong sign” of the exponents of A is due to\r
the fact that M will correspond to the inverse of the spatial metric.] The\r
main technical difference with the kind of Iwasawa decompositions used in\r
the foregoing sections is that now the matrix V(t) is infinite dimensional for\r
indefinite g(A). Observe that for finite dimensional matrices, there was no\r
need to worry about root multiplicities, as these are always one. By contrast,\r
there are now infinitely many ν’s, and consequently N contains an infinite\r
tower of new degrees of freedom. Next we define\r

α(β) ≡ αµβ\r

(8.43)\r
for the value of the root α ( ≡ linear form) on the CSA element β = β\r

Next we define\r

Here the Lorentzian metric Gµν is the restriction of the invariant bilinear\r
form to the CSA. It can be identified with the metric in the space of the scale\r
factors, which is why we adopt the same notation. We have introduced in this\r
Lagrangian a “lapse function” n (not to be confused with the lapse function\r
N introduced before), which ensures that our formalism is invariant under\r
reparametrizations of the time variable. Finally, we can simply describe our\r
Lagrangian (8.44) as that of a null geodesic in the coset space G/K.\r
66

Taking the algebra AE3 as an example, this Lagrangian contains the Kas\u0002ner Lagrangian (3.10) (without dilaton) as a special truncation. More specif\u0002ically, retaining only the level zero fields (corresponding to a GL(3, R)/O(3)\r
σ-model)\r

a\r
b ≡ (exp h)\r
a\r
b\r
,\r
and a corresponding contravariant metric g\r
ab = ea\r
ce\r
b\r
c, one checks that the\r
bilinear form (8.18) reproduces (half) the Lagrangian (3.10). [This compu\u0002tation works more generally for any GL(n, R), and was already used in [28]\r
in the GL(10, R) decomposition of E10.] The level-0 sector is thus associated\r
with the Einsteinian dynamics of a spatial dreibein depending only on time.\r
Let us then consider the fields φij associated with the level-one generators\r
Eij . This leads to a truncation of our KM-invariant σ-model to the levels\r
ℓ = 0, 1, i.e.\r
V(t)\r

In the gauge n = 1, the Lagrangian now has the form L ∼ (g\r
−1\r
g˙)\r
2+g−1\r
g\r
−1φ˙φ˙\r
,\r
where g denotes the covariant metric gij . As the φij ’s enter only through\r
their time derivatives, their conjugate momenta Πij are constants of the\r
motion. Eliminating the φ’s in favour of the constant momenta Π by a partial\r
Legendre transformation yields the reduced Lagrangian (for the dynamics of\r
gij (t)) of the form L ∼ (g\r
−1\r
g˙)\r
2 − g+1g+1ΠΠ. In other words, the elimination\r
of the φ’s has generated a potential Vφ = Vφ(g) (in the gauge n = 1)\r
Vφ(g) ∝ +gijgklΠ\r
ikΠjl (8.47)\r
It is then easy to check that this potential can be identified with the lead\u0002ing (weight-2) gravitational potential in (6.14) (corresponding to the gauge\r
N˜ = 1), namely V\r

Note that the trace C\r
j\r
jk drops out of this relation, and that Πij is of weight\r
one, like ε\r
ijk\r
.\r
Consequently, when neglecting the subleading gravitational walls ∝ Fain\r
(6.14) and in four spacetime dimensions, the BKL dynamics at each given\r
spatial point x0 is equivalent to the ℓ = 0, ±1 truncation of the AE3-invariant\r
67

dynamics defined by (8.44). The fields φij (t) parametrizing the components\r
of the AE3 coset element along the ℓ = 1 generators are canonically conjugate\r
to the structure constants C\r
i\r
jk(t, x0).\r
Similarly, one would like to associate the generators (8.33) with higher\r
order spatial gradients. However, the proper physical interpretation of these\r
fields as well as of the other higher level components remains yet to be found.\r
In the case of the relation between supergravity in D = 11 and the E10 coset\r
model one could pursue the correspondence between spacetime fields and\r
coset coordinates up to the gl(10, R) level ℓ = 3 included (corresponding\r
to height 29) [28]. The correspondence worked thanks to several “miracu\u0002lous” agreements between the numerical coefficients appearing in both La\u0002grangians.\r
Varying (8.44) w.r.t. the lapse function n gives rise to the constraint that\r
the coset Lagrangian vanish. Let us define the canonical momenta\r
πµ :=\r
δL\r
δβ˙µ\r

ννp + · · ·\r

In terms of these variables the KM-invariant Hamiltonian corresponding\r
to the above Lagrangian reads\r

The constraint of a vanishing Lagrangian becomes that of a vanishing Hamil\u0002tonian:\r
H ≈ 0 (8.52)\r
The momentum-like variables Πα,s can be thought of as infinite-dimensional\r
generalizations of the asymptotically frozen combinations P\r
j\r
aN b\r
j used in\r
section 5.1, cf. Eq.(5.14). They do not Poisson-commute with one another\r

in general. Instead one has Poisson brackets of the form {Πα,r, Πβ,s} =\r
Ω\r
γ,t\r
α,r β,s(ν)Πγ,t. Note that πµ is timelike or null because the potential is mani\u0002festly non-negative; the motion in the CSA is timelike — in fact, in the limit\r
to be studied below, a broken future-oriented lightlike line.\r
Because the coefficients of the exponentials in (8.51) are non-negative we\r
can now apply exactly the same reasoning as in chapter 5. The crucial point\r
is that the Cartan variables β do not enter the commutation relations of the\r
Π as indicated above. Therefore, as above, the off-diagonal components να,s\r
and the momentum-like variables Πα,s get frozen asymptotically, provided\r
all spacelike walls are “behind the motion” so that they do not conflict with\r
the BKL limit. As before, we can introduce hyperbolic polar coordinates for\r
parametrizing the dynamics of the Cartan variables β\r
µ = ργµ\r
. When taking\r
the limit ρ → ∞, the Hamiltonian (8.52) behaves as\r

Kα exp [ − 2α(β)] (8.53)\r
with constants Kα ≥ 0. This looks like a Toda Hamiltonian, except that\r
the sum extends over all roots, rather than only the simple ones, and that\r
the underlying KM algebra is indefinite, and not just finite or affine as in\r
standard Toda theory. However, the dominant potential walls in the limit\r
ρ → ∞ are given by those terms Kα exp [ − 2α(β)] for which α is a simple\r
root. Indeed, by definition, the non-simple roots α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · ·\r
give rise to potential terms ∝ [exp(−2α1(β))]n1[exp(−2α2(β))]n2\r
· · · which\r
are subdominant w.r.t. the set of potentials corresponding to the simple\r
roots.15 Therefore, the σ-model Hamiltonian is asymptotically equivalent to\r

15Perhaps a useful analogy is to think of a mountainscape (defined by Toda exponential\r
potentials for all roots); when the mountaintops rise into the sky, only the nearest moun\u0002tains (corresponding to the simple roots) remain visible to the observer in the valley (the\r
Weyl chamber).\r

assumption” Ki > 0 for the dominant simple root contributions (which is\r
subject to the same caveats as before), we finally obtain the asymptotic\r

where the sum is over the simple roots only, and the motion of the β\r

confined to the fundamental Weyl chamber αi(β) ≥ 0. Note that, in the\r
present KM setup, all the walls enter on the same footing. There is nothing\r
left of the distinctions that entered our foregoing BKL-type studies between\r
different types of walls (symmetry walls, gravitational walls, electric walls,...).\r
The only important characteristic of a wall is its height ht α ≡ n1 + n2 + · · ·\r
for a root decomposed along simple roots as α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · ·.\r
The sum in (8.52) not only ranges over the real roots, which give rise to\r
infinitely many timelike walls, but also over null and purely imaginary roots\r
of the KM algebra giving rise to lightlike and spacelike walls, respectively. In\r
view of our discussion in section 7, the significance of the latter for the KM\r
billiard remains to be fully elucidated. Here we only remark that imaginary\r
roots are of no relevance for the Weyl group of the KM algebra, which by defi\u0002nition consists only of reflections against the timelike hyperplanes orthogonal\r
to real roots.\r
To conclude: in the limit where one goes to infinity in the Cartan di\u0002rections, the dynamics of the Cartan degrees of freedom of the coset model\r
become equivalent to a billiard motion within the Weyl chamber, subject to\r
the zero-energy constraint H(β, π) = 0. Therefore, in the cases where the\r
cosmological billiards that we discussed in the first part of this paper are\r
of KM-type, the gravitational models are asymptotically equivalent (modulo\r
the imposition of the additional momentum and Gauss constraints) to the\r
product over the spatial points of independent (1 + 0)-dimensional KM coset\r
models G/K.\r
8.4 Integrability, chaos and consistent truncations\r
In this final subsection, we show that the one-dimensional KM σ-models\r
are formally integrable. Then we address the issue of why this formal in\u0002tegrability is not incompatible with the occurrence of chaos in the billiard\r
description. We also discuss various possible finite-dimensional truncations\r
of our infinite-dimensional KM-invariant σ-model.\r
70

The equations of motion of the off-diagonal fields constitute an infinite\r
system of non-linear ordinary differential equations of second order. As usual,\r
they are equivalent to the conservation of the g(A)-valued Noether charge\r

s=1\r
(Jα,sEα,s + J−α,sE−α,s) (8.56)\r
in the gauge n = 1. It is easily checked from the first line of this equation\r
that\r
J = M−1M˙ (8.57)\r
This equation can be formally solved as\r
M(t) = M(0) · exp(tJ) (8.58)\r
For finite dimensional matrices M, the system is thus completely integrable.\r
This fact was already used in section 4 where we wrote down the exact so\u0002lution (4.1) of a GL(n, R)/O(n) model. More precisely, the GL(n, R) analog\r
of the (Lie-algebra valued) conserved charge J is π\r
i\r
j =\r
1\r
2\r
g\r
ikg˙kj , whose con\u0002servation is clear from Eq. (3.13) . [Note again that the KM gauge n = 1\r
corresponds to N˜ = 1 so that the KM time variable t corresponds to the\r
gravitational time scale τ .] In the finite-dimensional case we could derive\r
the general solution by diagonalizing the constant matrix π\r
i\r
j\r
, which led to\r
the Kasner solution, written in terms of the eigenvalues v\r
a of πi\r
j and of the\r
diagonalizing matrix L as in (4.1). Then, thanks to finite dimensionality\r
of the diagonalizing matrix, we showed there that, after a finite transition\r
time (subsequently interpreted as linked to the finite number of collisions\r
on the symmetry walls needed to reorder the eigenvalues v\r
a\r
), the resulting\r
asymptotic motion assumed a very simple monotonic form.\r
By contrast, for infinite dimensional matrices the existence of the formal\r
solution (8.58) does not necessarily imply regular behavior for the CSA de\u0002grees of freedom in the asymptotic limit where all other degrees of freedom get\r
frozen. First of all, and in marked contrast to the finite dimensional case, it is\r
not known for indefinite KM algebras whether a generic Lie-algebra element\r
J can always be “diagonalized”, i.e. conjugated into the CSA by an element\r
of the KM group G, see however [67]. Indeed, if that were the case, it would\r
mean that a generic solution of the KM coset dynamics could be conjugated\r
to a simple monotonic and diagonal Kasner-like solution β\r
µ = vµ\r
t+β\r
µ\r
0\r
in the\r
71

CSA, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with the chaotic motion that obtains\r
in the BKL limit if the KM algebra is hyperbolic. Secondly, even if J could\r
be conjugated into the CSA (as might be the case for certain non-generic el\u0002ements) there remains the possibility that the required diagonalizing matrix\r
(an infinite dimensional analog of the matrix L in (4.1)) introduces an infinite\r
number of effective collisions in the time development of the analog of (4.1),\r
because the number of effective collisions was found to increase with the rank\r
of the matrix. In the latter case, the chaotic motion for the CSA degrees of\r
freedom would be the result of the projection onto a finite-dimensional space\r
of a regular geodesic motion taking place in an infinite-dimensional phase\r
space. In the former case, it might be the geodesic motion on the infinite\u0002dimensional coset-space G/K which could be intrinsically chaotic. We will\r
leave further investigation of these delicate mathematical questions to future\r
work.\r
In order to better understand why the existence of an infinite number of\r
conserved quantities {J\r
µ\r
, Jα,s, J−α,s} does not rule out chaos, let us consider\r
possible consistent truncations of our σ-model. By a “consistent truncation”\r
we here mean a sub-model whose solutions are solutions of the full model.\r
In order to formalize this notion, let us introduce a gradation D of root\r
space: the D-degree of a root α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · · is defined as D(α) :=\r
n1D1 + n2D2 + · · ·, where (D1, D2, · · ·) is a given set of non-negative integers.\r
Examples are the sl(3, R)-level ℓ, the affine level m, or the height D(α) ≡\r
ht (α) = n1 + n2 + · · ·. In terms of an expansion according to increasing\r
gradation D, the full σ-model Lagrangian (8.44) has the structure (with all\r
coefficients suppressed and in the gauge n = 1):\r
L ∼ β˙ 2 + exp (2α1(β)) [ ˙ν\r
1\r
]\r
2 + exp (2α2(β)) [ ˙ν2 + ν1\r

2 + · · · (8.59)\r
The notation here is somewhat schematic: the lower indices on the roots\r
and the upper indices on the off-diagonal fields refer to the gradation D (so\r
α1, α2, . . . are not simple roots here). Furthermore, the degree zero term\r
coincides with the free CSA kinetic term β˙ 2only if Di > 0 for all i; for other\r
gradations, the level zero sector is described by the σ-model Lagrangian for\r
the respective level-0 subalgebra (which may be non-abelian as was the case\r
for the level ell used in section 4.2). The various terms within parentheses\r
correspond to the gradation of the jα,s above: j1 ∼ ν˙\r

p3 ∼ exp (2α3(β)) j3 + · · · = Π3 + · · · , (8.60)\r
where, consistently with the above definition, we have introduced the short\u0002hand notation Πn ≡ exp (2αn(β)) jn. Formally, the triangular relations above\r
can be inverted iteratively to get infinite series of the form\r
Π1 ∼ p1 + p2 ν\r
1 + p3 [ν2 + ν1\r

Π2 ∼ p2 + p3 ν\r
1 + p4 [ν2 + ν1\r

Π3 ∼ p3 + p4 ν\r

This yields a formal expression for the Hamiltonian in terms of the canonical\r
variables (β, π; ν\r

, pn), where n again refers to the gradation,\r
H(β, π; ν\r

It is now easy to see that one can obtain a consistent finite-dimensional\r
truncation of the dynamics by requiring that all canonical momenta above\r
a certain D-degree n0 vanish . For instance, if we require pn = 0 for n ≥ 3\r
implying Πn = 0 for all n ≥ 3 we get a consistent dynamics following from\r
the finite Hamiltonian\r
H(2)(β, π; ν\r

The finite-dimensional Lagrangian corresponding to this Hamiltonian reads\r
L\r

]\r
2 + exp (2α2(β)) [ ˙ν2 + ν1\r
ν˙\r

]\r
2\r
(8.64)\r
and is obtained from the original Lagrangian (8.59) by setting to zero all jn\r
for n ≥ 3, where, for instance, j3 = ˙ν\r
3 + ν1ν˙2 + ν2ν˙1 + ν1ν1ν˙1\r
, and so on.\r
Note that the highest-degree variable ν\r
2 does not explicitly appear in the\r
73

truncated Hamiltonian H(2). This implies that the corresponding highest\u0002degree canonical momentum p2 is a constant of the motion. However, non\u0002trivial dynamics is obtained for the remaining degrees of freedom β, π; ν\r
1\r
, p1.\r
Note also that a particular set of solutions of the D-degree-2 dynamics above\r
is obtained when the constant of motion p2 happens to vanish. This particular\r
case of the D-degree-2 dynamics is simply the D-degree-1 truncation of the\r
original dynamics, obtained by setting to zero all momenta above level 2, i.e.\r
p2 = p3 = . . . = 0. The corresponding Hamiltonian is simply\r
H(1)(β, π; ν\r
1\r
, p1) ∼ π\r
2 + exp ( − 2α1(β)) p2\r
1\r
(8.65)\r
Again the highest-degree momentum, which is now p1, is a constant of the\r
motion, so that H(1) directly defines the reduced dynamics of the Cartan\r
variables β, π.\r
For D ≡ ht, the truncated dynamics (8.65) at degree D = 1 defines the\r
finite hyperbolic Toda model (8.54) involving only the simple roots. We have\r
seen in the previous subsection that this height-1 Hamiltonian universally de\u0002scribes the asymptotic dynamics of the full σ-model. [Its BKL-limit directly\r
yields the universal Weyl-chamber billiard (8.55).] On the other hand, when\r
the chosen gradation is the sl(3) level of AE3, we get the low-level trunca\u0002tions of subsection 8.2 above: the level-0 truncation (p1 = . . . = 0) yields\r
the Kasner dynamics, while the level-1 dynamics describes the leading effect\r
of the gravitational walls. A similar hierarchy of truncations appears in the\r
E10 model of [28], where the analysis included levels ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3 w.r.t. to\r
the sl(10, R) ≡ A9 (see also [25]).\r
Let us now clarify the meaning of the infinite set of conserved charges\r
J±α,s within the context of the finite-dimensional truncations which we just\r
discussed. To this aim, one expresses J in terms of the (non-canonical)\r
Hamiltonian variables (β, π, ν, Π):\r
J = π\r

s=1\r
Πα,sN\r
−1E−α,sN (8.66)\r
Here only the third term spreads over the full algebra g = n\r
− ⊕ h ⊕ n+,\r
while the first and second are entirely contained in the parabolic subalge\u000274

bras h ⊕ n\r
+ and n+, respectively. From this fact, it is easy to see that any\r
truncation where the Πα,s vanish for all roots strictly above some degree, i.e.\r
for D(α) > n0, implies the vanishing of the correspondingly low “negative\u0002root charges” J−α,s. As for the non-zero highest-degree momenta Πα0,s with\r
D(α0) = n0, Eq. (8.66) simply yields Πα0,s = J−α0,s. We thus recover the\r
result above concerning the constancy of the highest-degree momenta. We\r
can then move up (always in D-degree) by adding simple roots αi to α0.\r
Eq. (8.66) then implies Πα0−αi,s = J−α0+αi,s + cναiJ−α0,s, where the constant\r
c is determined by the commutations relations. Continuing in this manner\r
until one reaches the degree zero, one obtains for all the negative-degree\r
(non-vanishing) momenta expressions which are linear in the charges and\r
polynomial of ascending order in the off-diagonal fields να,s. Note, however,\r
that these relations do not suffice to eliminate non-trivial degrees of freedom\r
from the truncated Hamiltonian,i.e. to replace it by an (on-shell) equivalent\r
Hamiltonian depending on fewer variables. [The only degrees of freedom\r
that one can straightforwardly eliminate are the trivial highest-degree ones,\r
whose associated “position variables” do not enter the Hamiltonian.] One\r
might think that one would get further relations, and eventually enough re\u0002lations to eliminate the off-diagonal degrees of freedom, by considering the\r
higher-degree components of Eq. (8.66). However, it does not work this way.\r
The degree-zero projection, namely\r
π\r

µHµ (8.67)\r
(where c\r
µ\r
is a constant vector) gives an expression for the degree-zero mo\u0002menta π\r
µ which is linear in the charges and polynomial in the να,s’s. On the\r
other hand, the positive-degree projection of Eq. (8.66) yields for the positive\u0002degree components of the charges Jα,s expressions which (for any positive\r
degree) will involve “hidden” off-diagonal fields να,s of degree D(α) > n0.\r
These new variables did not enter the truncated Hamiltonians (8.63), which\r
shows explicitly that the infinite number of conserved charges Jα,s of the\r
original σ-model do not provide sufficiently many autonomous constants of\r
the motion for the truncated Hamiltonian to guarantee its “integrability” in\r
the trivial sense of allowing one to reduce the number of degrees of freedom\r
to zero.\r
Let us also dispose of another paradox concerning the formal integrability\r
of KM-related models. Even if we consider the hyperbolic Toda model defined\r
75

by the truncation of our general σ-model to height one, i.e. Hsimple(β, π) given\r
by Eq. (8.54) with (strictly) positive constants Ki, one finds that it has formal\r
integrability features. Indeed, the model (8.54) admits a Lax pair. Setting\r
si ≡\r
p\r
hαi|αii/2, rescaling the Chevalley-Serre generators as e\r
′\r
i = siei\r
, f\r
′\r
i =\r
sifi, h′\r
i = s\r
2\r

fi, and defining Wij ≡ hαi|αj i, we replace the variables (β\r
µ\r

by (l\r
i\r
, pi) by l\r
i ≡\r
√\r
Ki exp [ − αi(β)] and ΣjWijp\r
j ≡ Gµν (αi)µπν. One can\r
then check that the Lie-algebra valued expressions\r
M =\r

i\r
(e\r
′\r
i − f\r
′\r
i\r
), (8.68)\r
satisfy the Lax-pair evolution equation M˙ = [K, M]. One would then expect\r
to be able to write down (infinitely) many conserved quantities associated\r
to the isospectrality of the evolution of M(t). [In the finite-dimensional case\r
all the traces of the matrix M(t) are constants of the motion, see e.g. [90]\r
and references therein.] However, in the KM case this formal Lax-pair inte\u0002grability does not yield any concrete constants of the motion because there\r
is no useful analog of the matrix trace in the KM algebra. The integrability\r
properties of hyperbolic Toda theories have also been discussed in [43].\r
Let us note also in passing that there is full compatibility between our\r
general result of the asymptotic constancy of all the off-diagonal degrees\r
of freedom να,s, Πα,s and the existence of an infinite number of conserved\r
quantities Jα,s. Morally speaking the two infinite sets of asymptotic constants\r
of integration {lim να,s}, {lim Πα,s} correspond to the doubly infinite set of\r
charges {J±α,s} (in non-zero degree), and one can check the compatibility of\r
this correspondence by using the results above concerning truncated models.\r
As for the zero-level conservation law (8.67) it is also compatible with the\r
asymptotic limit because, in the gauge we use here (analogous to the β\u0002space picture of the billiard) all the components of the zero-degree momenta\r
π\r
µ\r
tend to zero asymptotically (because of the redhifts accumulated on the\r
receding walls).\r
In summary, there is thus no contradiction between the formal integra\u0002bility of our σ-model and the chaos that appears in its generic asymptotic\r
dynamics. This is mainly due to the presence of infinitely many degrees\r
of freedom, and the dynamics of the finite-dimensional truncations of the\r
σ-model of strictly positive degree.\r

9 Conclusions\r
In this paper, we have shown that theories involving gravity admit a remark\u0002able asymptotic description in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity in terms\r
of billiards in hyperbolic space. Depending on whether the actual billiard has\r
finite or infinite volume, the dynamical evolution of the local scale factors is\r
chaotic (oscillatory) or monotonic (Kasner-like). The billiard, and in partic\u0002ular its volume, is a fundamental characteristic of the theory, in the sense\r
that it is determined solely by the field content and the parameters in the\r
Lagrangian, and not by the initial conditions (in the generic case; i.e., there\r
may be initial conditions for which some walls are absent – and the billiard is\r
changed –, but these are exceptional). Although we have not investigated the\r
physical implications of this property for cosmological scenarios (in particu\u0002lar, string-inspired cosmologies [40, 14, 76, 98, 41]), nor its quantum analog,\r
we believe that this result is interesting in its own right because it uncovers\r
an intrinsic feature of gravitational theories. As discussed in section 8, the\r
regularity properties of some billiards appear to give a powerful handle on\r
possible hidden Kac-Moody symmetries, which remain to be exploited for\r
their full worth.\r

A Asymptotic freezing: a simple model\r
We have seen in the text that the “non-diagonal” phase-space variables (Q, P)\r
(i.e. all variables except the extended scale factors β\r
µ parametrizing the\r
diagonal-Iwasawa-part of the metric, and the dilaton), get frozen to constant\r
values in the BKL limit. We provide here a more detailed understanding\r
77

of this property by discussing a simpler model which captures the essential\r
features of the Hamiltonian (5.25).\r
Consider a system with two canonically conjugate pairs (q, p), (Q, P) and\r
time-dependent Hamiltonian\r
H(q, p, Q, P; T) = 1\r
2\r
p\r
2 +\r
1\r
2\r
(f(Q, P))2ρ\r
k\r
e\r
−ρq (k being any real number)\r
(A.1)\r
where ρ is ρ ≡ exp(T), with T the time variable. We have simplified here the\r
Hamiltonian (5.26) by eliminating the variable λ, i.e. by replacing it by an\r
explicit function of the coordinate time T, in the approximation of a constant\r
πλ, so that λ is a linear function of T (we scaled things so that λ = T). One\r
can think of (q, p) as mimicking the scale factors, while (Q, P) mimicks the\r
off-diagonal components or the p-form variables. In (A.1), there is only one\r
potential wall for q (namely, the second term). We shall consider later the\r
case with several walls.\r
Let us start by remarking the important fact that the variable f(Q, P)\r
has zero Poisson bracket with H, therefore it is a constant of the motion.\r
To simplify the following argument, we assume that we perform a canonical\r
transformation such that P\r
new = f(Q, P). Dropping henceforth the label\r
“new”, we get P = P0 where P0 is a constant which we assume to be different\r
from zero. The basic aim of this Appendix is then to show that the (new)\r
conjugate variable Q will also tend to a constant as T → +∞.\r
In the limit of large times, the motion in q is a free motion interrupted\r
by a collision against the potential wall,\r
q = p0|T − T0| + q0 (A.2)\r
where T0 is the time of the collision, q0 the turning point, and p0 the constant\r
momentum of q far from the wall. The location of the turning point is\r
determined by energy conservation (using the fact that p(T0) vanishes before\r
changing sign):\r
P\r
2\r
0 ρ\r
k\r
0\r
e\r
−ρ0q0 = p2\r
0\r
. (A.3)\r
The time scale ∆T of the collision (during which one feels the influence of the\r
exponential potential) is roughly of the order 1/(ρ0p0): the later the collision,\r
the sharper the wall. Let us evaluate the change in Q in the collision. To\r
that end, we need to integrate Q˙ = P ρkexp(−ρq) over the collision, which\r
yields\r
∆Q = P0\r
Z ∞\r
−∞\r
d T ρke\r
−ρ(p0|T −T0|+q0)\r
(A.4)\r
78

The integrand is maximum at T = T0. We can approximate the integral by\r
the value at the maximum times the time scale of the collision. Using (A.3),\r
one gets\r
∆Q ≈\r
p0\r
P0ρ0\r
=\r
p0\r
P0\r
e\r
−T0\r
(A.5)\r
Hence, the variable Q receives a kick during the collision (which can be of\r
order one at early times), but the later the collision (i.e. the larger T0), the\r
smaller the kick.\r
Assume now that there is another wall with the same prefactor and the\r
same time dependence, say at q = d, so that q bounces between these two\r
walls,\r
Vadditional =\r
1\r
2\r
P\r
2\r
ρ\r
k\r
e\r
−ρ(d−q)\r
.\r
At each collision Q receives a kick of order 1/ρ0 = e\r
−T0\r
. Because the\r
speed of q remains constant (in the large T limit), the collisions are equally\r
spaced in T. Therefore, the time of the nth collision grows linearly with n:\r
roughly T\r
(n)\r
0 ∼ nd/p0 The total change in Q is then obtained by summing\r
all the individual changes, which yields\r
(∆Q)T otal ∼\r
X\r
n\r
e\r
−n d/p0\r
(A.6)\r
This sum converges. Therefore, after a while, one can neglect the further\r
change in Q, i.e., assume Q˙ = 0. The Hamiltonian describing the large time\r
limit is obtained by taking the sharp wall limit in the above H, and reads\r
therefore\r
H =\r
1\r
2\r
p\r
2 + Θ(−q) + Θ(q − d). (A.7)\r
The pair (Q, P) drops out because it is asymptotically frozen. Our analysis\r
justifies taking the sharp wall limit directly in H for this system, which is\r
the procedure we followed in the text to get the gravitational billiards.\r
Note that, had we studied a more complicated model with different pref\u0002actors for the different walls, the prefactors fA(Q, P) would no longer have\r
been exactly conserved. However, their non-conservation would only have\r
been driven by the “far-away” walls, so that their time-variation would have\r
been exponentially small.\r

Abstract\r
It is shown in detail that the dynamics of the Einstein-dilaton-p\u0002form system in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity can be asymp\u0002totically described, at a generic spatial point, as a billiard motion in a\r
region of Lobachevskii space (realized as an hyperboloid in the space\r
of logarithmic scale factors). This is done within the Hamiltonian for\u0002malism, and for an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions D ≥ 4.\r
A key rˆole in the derivation is played by the Iwasawa decomposition\r
of the spatial metric, and by the fact that the off-diagonal degrees\r
of freedom, as well as the p-form degrees of freedom, get “asymp\u0002totically frozen” in this description. For those models admitting a\r
Kac-Moody theoretic interpretation of the billiard dynamics we out\u0002line how to set up an asymptotically equivalent description in terms\r
of a one-dimensional non-linear σ-model formally invariant under the\r
corresponding Kac-Moody group."""

The non-linearities of the Einstein equations are notably known to prevent\r
the construction of an exact general solution. Only peculiar solutions, corre\u0002sponding to idealized situations, have been explicitly derived. The singularity\r
theorems of [48] predict the generic appearance of spacetime singularities un\u0002der certain conditions, but do not provide a detailed description of how the\r
spacetime becomes singular. From this perspective, the work of Belinskii,\r
Khalatnikov and Lifshitz [6, 8], also known as “BKL”, is quite remarkable as\r
it gives a description of the generic asymptotic behaviour of the gravitational\r
field in four spacetime dimensions in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity.\r
As argued by these authors, near the singularity the spatial points essentially\r
decouple, in the sense that the dynamical evolution of the spatial metric at\r
each spatial point is asymptotically governed by a set of second-order, non\u0002linear ordinary differential equations with respect to time.\r
These differential equations are the same, at each spatial point, as those\r
that arise in some spatially homogeneous cosmological models, which there\u0002fore provide valuable insight into the qualitative features of the general so\u0002lution. In the vacuum case, the spatially homogeneous models that capture\r
the behaviour of the general solution are of Bianchi type IX or VIII (with\r
homogeneity groups SU(2) or SL(2, R)). The asymptotic evolution of the\r
metric can then be pictured as an infinite sequence of “oscillations” of the\r
scale factors along independent spatial directions [6, 8]. This regime is called\r
“oscillatory”, or “of mixmaster type” [82], or also “chaotic” because it ex\u0002hibits strong chaotic features [77, 16]. The coupling to matter fields does not\r
change the picture, except if one includes a massless scalar field (equivalent\r
to a perfect fluid with “stiff” equation of state p = ρ), in which case the\r
chaotic evolution is replaced by a monotonic power law evolution of the scale\r
factors [5, 2], which mimicks the Kasner solution at each spatial point and is\r
therefore called “Kasner-like”. In this case the spatially homogeneous model\r
that captures the behaviour of the general solution is the Bianchi I model\r
(with the abelian group of translations in R\r
3 as homogeneity group).\r

The extension of the BKL analysis to higher dimensions was addressed within\r
the context of pure gravity (with no symmetry assumption) in [33, 32], where\r
it was shown that the general BKL approach remains valid: spatial points\r
decouple as one approaches a spacelike singularity, i.e., the dynamical evolu\u0002tion at each spatial point of the scale factors is again governed by ordinary\r
differential equations. The main result of [33, 32], was that, while the general\r
behaviour of solutions of the vacuum Einstein equations remains oscillatory\r
for spacetime dimensions D ≤ 10, it ceases to be so for spacetime dimensions\r
D ≥ 11, where it becomes Kasner-like. Let us also note that, just as in four\r
spacetime dimensions, the coupling to a massless scalar field suppresses the\r
chaotic behaviour in any number of spacetime dimensions and makes the\r
solution monotonic (see, e.g., [29]).\r
The authors of [33] did not consider the inclusion of massless p-forms,\r
which are part of the low energy bosonic sector of superstring/M-theory mod\u0002els. This task was undertaken in [24, 25], with the finding that these p-forms\r
play a crucial role and can reinstate chaos when it is otherwise suppressed.\r
In particular, even though pure gravity is non-chaotic in eleven spacetime\r
dimensions, the 3-form of D = 11 supergravity renders the system chaotic.\r
Similarly, the bosonic sectors of all D = 10 supergravities related to string\r
models define chaotic dynamical systems, thanks again to the p-forms, and\r
in spite of the presence of a massless scalar dilaton. It is remarkable and sig\u0002nificant that the (maximally supersymmetric) candidate models for a unified\r
description of the fundamental forces not only have difficulties accomodating\r
de Sitter-type spacetimes in any straightforward fashion [45, 80], but fur\u0002thermore, and without exception, exhibit BKL chaos as one approaches the\r
initial singularity."""

An efficient way to grasp the asymptotic behaviour of the fields as one ap\u0002proaches a spacelike singularity is based on the qualitative Hamiltonian meth\u0002ods initiated by Misner [83] in the context of the Bianchi IX models (in four\r
spacetime dimensions). The Hamiltonian approach naturally leads to a bil\u0002liard description of the asymptotic evolution, in which the logarithms of the\r
spatial scale factors define (after projecting out the dynamics of the overall\r
volume factor) a geodesic motion in a region of the Lobachevskii plane H2,\r
2

interrupted by geometric reflections against the walls bounding this region\r
[17, 84]. Chaos follows from the fact that the Bianchi IX billiard has finite\r
volume1.\r
As pointed out in [71, 73, 56, 57, 26] this useful billiard description is quite\r
general and can be extended to higher spacetime dimensions, with p-forms\r
and dilaton. If d ≡ D−1 is the number of spatial dimensions, and if there are\r
n dilatons, the billiard is a region of hyperbolic space Hd+n−1, each dilaton\r
being equivalent, in the Hamiltonian, to the logarithm of a new scale factor.\r
Besides the dimension of the hyperbolic billiard, the other ingredients that\r
enter its definition are the walls that bound it. These walls can be of different\r
types [24, 26]: symmetry walls related to the off-diagonal components of the\r
spatial metric, gravitational walls related to the spatial curvature, and p\u0002form walls (electric and magnetic) arising from the p-form energy-density.\r
All these walls are hyperplanar. The billiard is a convex polyhedron with\r
finitely many vertices, some of which are at infinity. In many important\r
cases, the billiard can be identified with the Weyl chamber of a Kac-Moody\r
algebra, and the reflections against the billiard walls with the fundamental\r
Weyl reflections [26, 27, 23]. This suggests deep connections with infinite\r
symmetries.\r
The main purpose of this paper is to provide a self-contained derivation\r
of the billiard picture, in the general context of inhomogeneous solutions in\r
D dimensions, with dilaton and p-form gauge fields. In particular, we shall\r
present a detailed derivation of the general results, announced and used in\r
Ref. [24, 26], on the form of the various possible walls. For that purpose,\r
we shall rely on the Iwasawa decomposition (see e.g. [49]) of the spatial\r
metric. This provides an efficient derivation of the symmetry walls in any\r
number of spacetime dimensions, which we obtain by working out explicitly\r
the Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics in the “BKL limit” or “small\r
volume limit”.\r
The present work is exclusively concerned with properties of solutions of\r
Einstein’s equations and their generalizations in the vicinity of a spacelike\r
singularity. Accordingly, our treatment does not apply to timelike singular\u0002ities, for which no analog of causal decoupling exists (the situation may be\r
more subtle for the borderline case of a null singularity). Furthermore, we\r
1Throughout this paper, the word billiard used as a noun in the singular will denote\r
the dynamical system consisting of a ball moving freely on a “table” (region in some\r
Riemannian space), with elastic bounces against the edges. Billiard will also sometimes\r
mean the table itself.\r

are not making the claim here that all spacelike singularities are necessar\u0002ily and uniformly of the BKL type. Rather, the results presented here are\r
intended to refine and to generalize the work of [6, 7] by showing that, in\r
higher dimensions and for many theoretically relevant matter sources, one\r
can self-consistently describe the behaviour of all fields, in the vicinity of\r
a spacelike singularity, and at a generic spatial point x, in terms of (i) a\r
simple hyperbolic billiard description of the “angular” dynamics (γ, πγ) of\r
the logarithmic scale factors (after projection of the “radial” motion (ρ, πρ)),\r
and (ii) an asymptotic “freezing” of the other phase space variables. This\r
self-consistent asymptotic solution is general in the sense that it involves as\r
many arbitrary functions of space as the most general solution."""

After fixing our conventions and notations, and defining the class of La\u0002grangians we shall consider in section 2, we discuss in section 3 the homo\u0002geneous and diagonal Kasner solution in D spacetime dimensions, with a\r
dilaton (as usual, the term “homogeneous” implies invariance under spa\u0002tial translations). This solution plays a crucial rˆole in the BKL approach\r
because it describes the “free motion between collisions” and allows us to\r
develop an important tool of our approach: the (Minkowskian) geometry of\r
the scale factors. We then introduce (in section 4) the other main tool of\r
our investigation: the Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric. To gain\r
some familiarity with it, we discuss the asymptotic behaviour of non-diagonal\r
Kasner metrics.\r
In section 5, we explain the appearance of sharp potential walls in full\r
generality, without imposing any homogeneity conditions on the metric and\r
the matter fields. We then discuss in great detail the various walls that\r
appear in physical models: symmetry walls, gravitational walls and p-form\r
walls. The resulting geometry of the “billiard” made from all these walls\r
is analyzed in section 7. Section 8 is devoted to the case when the billiard\r
can be identified with the Weyl chamber of a Kac-Moody algebra. To deal\r
with this case we set up a Kac-Moody theoretic formulation of the billiard in\r

In the sequel, we shall refer to this space as the “extended space of (logarith\u0002mic) scale factors” or just “the β-space” for short.\r
Combining the scale factors and the dilaton(s) in a single space is natural\r
because we know from Kaluza-Klein theory that the dilaton can be viewed as\r
the logarithm of a scale factor in one extra spatial dimension. Independently\r
of whether the original metric (2.3) has non-vanishing curvature or not, the\r
metric (3.15) induced in the space of the scale factors (possibly including the\r
dilaton) is flat. More precisely, the metric Gµν of the (extended) space of scale\r
factors is a Minkowski metric in R\r
d+1 with signature (− + + · · ·+). For in\u0002stance, the direction in which only the dilaton varies [i.e. dβµ ∝ (0, · · · , 0, 1)]\r
is spacelike, while the direction in which only one scale factor varies [e.g.,\r
dβµ ∝ (1, 0, · · ·, 0)] is null. A timelike direction in this space is the direction\r
dβµ ∝ (1, 1, · · ·, 1, 0). This reflects the familiar fact that the gravitational ac\u0002tion is not bounded from below (even with Euclidean signature): conformal\r
transformations of the metric, in which the scale factors are all scaled in the\r
same fashion, make dσ2 negative. It is this characteristic feature of gravity\r
which is responsible for the Lorentzian nature of the Kac-Moody algebras\r
which emerge in the analysis of the billiard symmetries [26]. The Lorentzian\r
signature of the metric in the space of the scale factors enables one to define\r
the light cone through any point. We define the time-orientation to be such\r

These explicit formulas show that the evolution of the Iwasawa variables\r
(β, N ) in the generic non-diagonal case is rather complicated. However,\r
what will be important in the following is that they drastically simplify in\r
the asymptotic limit t → 0, i.e. τ → +∞. Without loss of generality, one\r
can assume p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. If necessary, this can be achieved by multiplying\r
L by an appropriate permutation matrix. We shall in fact only consider\r
p1 < p2 < p3, leaving the discussion of the limiting cases to the reader. For\r
generic L, i.e. l1 6= 0, r1 6= 0, l1m2 − l2m1 6= 0, and m1r2 − m2r1 6= 0, one\r
then finds the following asymptotic behaviour as t → 0, i.e. τ → +∞ :\r
τ → +∞ : β\r

. (4.18)\r
Here we used the links derived above between (pµ, t) and (v\r
µ\r
, τ ).\r
The remarkable feature of these results is that, in the limit τ → +∞,\r
the evolution of the Iwasawa variables (β, N ) is essentially as simple as the\r
evolution we obtained in the diagonal case. Namely, the diagonal degrees of\r
freedom β in the Iwasawa decomposition behave linearly with τ , while the\r
elements of the upper triangular matrix N tend to constants. That the ni’s\r
should asymptotically tend to constants should be clear because they are\r
homogeneous functions of degree zero in the metric coefficients — in fact,\r
ratios of polynomials of degree one or two in the t\r
2pi\r
. It is more subtle that\r
the scale factors exp(−2β\r
i\r
), which are homogeneous of degree one in the gij ’s,\r
are not all driven by the fastest growing (or least decreasing) term (t\r
2p1\r
for\r
t → 0\r
+). This is what happens for the first scale factor exp(−2β1\r
). However,\r
the second scale factor exp(−2β\r
2\r
) feels the subleading term t\r
2p2 because the\r
leading term drops from its numerator, equal to the minor g11g22 − (g12)\r

3\r
), which feels\r
only the smallest term t\r
2p3 as t → 0+.\r
The results (4.18) admit a simple generalization to d dimensions. By re\u0002peating the above explicit calculation, one can prove that, in any dimension\r
d, the β’s become asymptotically linear functions of τ , as in the diagonal case,\r
with coefficients that are given by a permutation of the underlying diagonal\r
Kasner exponents. Furthermore, the N a\r
i tend to constants, a phenomenon\r
which we will refer to as the “asymptotic freezing” of the off-diagonal metric\r
variables. More precisely, let v\r
1 ≤ v2 ≤ · · · ≤ vd be the ordered (unnormal\u0002ized) underlying Kasner exponents; then, for generic L, we have\r
β\r
a ∼ va\r
τ and N\r
a\r
i → const. (4.19)\r
as τ → +∞ or, equivalently, t → 0\r
+. An alternative derivation of these\r
results will follow, as a particular case, from the general result we shall de\u0002rive below concerning the qualitative evolution of generic, inhomogeneous,\r
matter-driven solutions in Iwasawa variables (after projecting out the radial\r
motion of the Iwasawa β variables).\r
Note also that, in the simple case of homogeneous nondiagonal metrics\r
in vacuo (without curvature and/or matter) one can discuss not only the\r
limit t → 0, but also the limit t → +∞ (i.e τ → −∞). In this second\r
limit, one finds again that the β’s become asymptotically linear functions of\r
τ , with coefficients that are given by a permutation of the underlying Kasner\r
exponents, and that the N a\r
i tend to constants. More precisely, for any d,\r
β\r
a ∼ v(d−a)\r
τ , while the explicit results in d = 3 read\r
τ → −∞ : β\r
1 ∼ p3τ , β2 ∼ p2τ , β3 ∼ p1τ,\r

(4.20)\r
Note that in both limits, one has β\r
1 ≤ β2 ≤ · · · ≤ βd\r
. The fact that the β’s\r
are ordered in this way is due to our choice of an upper triangular N ; had we\r
taken N to be lower triangular instead, these inequalities would have been\r
reversed."""

Having warmed up with the simple diagonal and homogeneous Kasner so\u0002lution in Section 3, and having introduced the Iwasawa decomposition of\r
19

the metric (Section 4), we are now ready to apply these techniques to the\r
description of the asymptotic dynamics in the limit t → 0 to the general in\u0002homogeneous, matter-driven case. The main ingredients (already introduced\r
above for the homogeneous solutions) of our study are:\r
• use of the Hamiltonian formalism,\r
• Iwasawa decomposition of the metric, i.e. gij → (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i),\r
• decomposition of β\r
µ = (βa\r
, φ) into radial (ρ) and angular (γ\r
µ\r
) parts,\r
and\r
• use of the pseudo-Gaussian gauge (2.5), i.e. of the time coordinate T\r
as the evolution parameter.\r
More explicitly, with the conventions already described before, we assume\r
that in some spacetime patch, the metric is given by (2.3) (pseudo-Gaussian\r
gauge), such that the local volume g collapses at each spatial point as x\r
0 →\r
+∞, in such a way that the proper time t tends to 0+. We work in the\r
Hamiltonian formalism, i.e. with first order evolution equations in the phase\u0002space of the system. For instance, the gravitational degrees of freedom are\r
initially described by the metric gij and its conjugate momentum π\r
ij . We\r
systematically use the Iwasawa decomposition (4.5) of the metric to replace\r
the d(d + 1)/2 variables gij by the d + d(d − 1)/2 variables (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i). Note\r
that (β\r
a\r
, N a\r
i) are ultralocal functions of gij , that is they depend, at each\r
spacetime point, only on the value of gij at that point, not on its derivatives.\r
This would not have been the case if we had used a “Kasner frame” (as\r
defined below) instead of an Iwasawa one. The transformation g → (β, N )\r
then defines a corresponding transformation of the conjugate momenta, as we\r
will explain below. We then augment the definition of the β’s by adding the\r
dilaton field, i.e. β\r
µ ≡ (βa\r
, φ), and define the hyperbolic radial coordinate ρ\r
as in (3.33). Note that ρ is also an ultralocal function of the configuration\r
variables (gij , φ). We assume that the hyperbolic coordinate ρ can be used\r
everywhere in a given region of space near the singularity as a well-defined\r
(real) quantity which tends to +∞ as we approach the singularity. We then\r
define the slicing of spacetime by imposing the gauge condition (2.5). The\r
time coordinate corresponding to this gauge is called T as above (see (2.7)).\r
Our aim is to study the asymptotic behaviour of all the dynamical variables\r
β(T), N (T), ..... as T → +∞ (recall that this limit also corresponds to t → 0,\r
20

√g → 0, ρ → +∞, with β\r
µ going to infinity inside the future light cone).\r
Of course, we must also ascertain the self-consistency of this limit, which we\r
shall refer to as the “BKL limit”."""

In the decomposition of the Hamiltonian given above, we have split off the\r
kinetic terms of the scale factors β\r

µ ≡ βµ/ρ. As a con\u0002sequence, the asymptotic dynamics can be described as a “billiard” in the\r
hyperbolic space of the γ\r
µ\r
’s, whose walls (or “cushions”) are determined by\r
the energy of the fields that are asymptotically frozen.\r
This reduction of the complicated potential to a much simpler “effective\r
potential” V∞(γ\r

V on the diagonal Iwasawa variables β\r
µ\r
, from its independence from the\r

conjugate momenta of the β’s, and from the fact that the radial magnitude\r
ρ of the β’s becomes infinitely large in the BKL limit.\r
To see the essence of this reduction, with a minimum of technical com\u0002plications, let us consider a potential density (of weight 2) of the general\r
form\r
V(β, Q, P) = X\r
A\r
cA(Q, P) exp ( − 2wA(β)) (5.25)\r

on the (extended) scale factors, and whose precise form will be derived in\r
the following section. Similarly we shall discuss below the explicit form of\r
the pre-factors cA, which will be some complicated polynomial functions of\r
the remaining fields, i.e. the off-diagonal components of the metric, the p\u0002form fields and their respective conjugate momenta, and of some of their\r
spatial gradients. The fact that the wA(β) depend linearly on the scale\r
factors β\r
µ\r
is an important property of the models under consideration. A\r
second non-trivial fact is that, for the leading contributions, the pre-factors\r
are always non-negative, i.e. c\r
leading\r
A ≥ 0. Since the values of the fields for\r
which cA = 0 constitute a set of measure zero, we will usually make the\r
“genericity assumption” cA > 0 for the leading terms in the potential V"""

formalize this behaviour we define the sharp wall Θ-function7 as\r
Θ(x) := \u001A\r
0 if x < 0\r

(5.27)\r
A basic formal property of this Θ-function is its invariance under multiplica\u0002tion by a positive quantity. With the above assumption checked below that\r

such that the restricted set of inequalities {wA′(γ) ≥ 0} imply the full set\r
{wA(γ) ≥ 0}. The concept of dominant wall will be illustrated below. [Note\r
that the concept of “dominant” wall is a refinement of the distinction, which\r
will also enter our discussion, between a leading wall and a subleading one.]\r
The crucial point is that the limiting Hamiltonian (5.29) no longer de\u0002pends on λ, Q and P. Therefore the Hamiltonian equations of motion for\r
λ, Q and P tell us that the corresponding conjugate momenta, i.e. πλ, P and\r
Q, respectively, all become constants of the motion in the limit λ → +∞.\r
The total Hamiltonian density H∞ is also a constant of the motion (which\r
must be set to zero). The variable λ evolves according to dλ/dT = −\r

Hence, in the limit, λ is a linear function of T. The only non-trivial dynamics\r

the resulting motion of the γ’s indeed constitutes a billiard, with geodesic\r

wA(β) = 0.\r
We note in passing that an alternative route for reducing the dynamics\r
to a billiard in γ-space would be to eliminate the variable λ by solving the\r
Hamiltonian constraint for πλ. This allows one to use λ as a time variable,\r

Geodesic motion in a billiard in hyperbolic space has been much studied. It\r
is known that this motion is chaotic or non-chaotic depending on whether\r
the billiard has finite or infinite volume [81, 52, 101, 36]. In the finite volume\r
case, the generic evolution exhibits an infinite number of collisions with the\r
walls with strong chaotic features (“oscillating behavior”).\r
By contrast, if the billiard has infinite volume, the evolution is non\u0002chaotic. For a generic evolution, there are only finitely many collisions with\r
the walls. The system generically settles after a finite time in a Kasner-like\r
motion that lasts all the way to the singularity.\r
27

5.2.3 β-space description\r
The above derivation relied on the use of hyperbolic polar coordinates (ρ, γ).\r
This use is technically useful in that it represents the walls as being located\r
at an asymptotically fixed position in hyperbolic space, namely wA(γ) = 0.\r
However, once one has derived the final result (5.29), one can reexpress it\r
in terms of the original variables β\r
µ\r
, which run over a linear (Minkowski)\r
space. Owing to the linearity of wA(β) = ρwA(γ) in this Minkowskian pic\u0002ture, the asymptotic motion takes place in a “polywedge”, bounded by the\r
hyperplanes wA(β) = 0. The billiard motion then consists of free motions\r
of β\r
µ on straight lightlike lines within this polywedge, which are interrupted\r
by specular reflections off the walls. [See formula (7.3) below for the explicit\r
effect of these reflections on the components of the velocity vector of the\r
β-particle.] Indeed, when going back to β-space (i.e. before taking the BKL\r
limit), the dynamics of the scale factors at each point of space is given by\r
the Hamiltonian\r

The β-space dynamics simplifies in the gauge N˜ = 1, corresponding to the\r

where the sum is again only over the dominant walls. When taking equal\r
time slices of this polywedge (e.g., slices on which Σiβ\r
i\r
is constant), it is\r
clear that with increasing time (i.e increasing Σiβ\r
i\r
, or increasing τ or ρ) the\r
walls recede from the observer. The β-space picture is useful for simplifying\r
the mathematical representation of the dynamics of the scale factors which\r
takes place in a linear space. However, it is inconvenient both for proving\r
that the exponential walls of (5.31) do reduce, in the large Σiβ\r
i\r
limit to\r
sharp walls, and for dealing with the dynamics of the other phase-space\r
variables (Q, P), whose appearance in the coefficients cA has been suppressed\r
in (5.31) above. Let us only mention that, in order to prove, in this picture,\r
the freezing of the phase space variables (Q, P) one must consider in detail\r
the accumulation of the “redshifts” of the energy-momentum πµ of the β\u0002particle when it undergoes reflections on the receding walls, and the effect\r
28

of the resulting decrease of the magnitudes of the components of πµ on the\r
evolution of (Q, P). (In the notation of Appendix A, it is important to take\r
into account the fact that p0 decreases with time.) By contrast, the γ-space\r
picture that we used above allows for a more streamlined treatment of the\r
effect of the limit ρ → +∞ on the sharpening of the walls and on the freezing\r
of (Q, P).\r
In summary, the dynamics simplifies enormously in the asymptotic limit.\r
It becomes ultralocal in that it reduces to a continuous superposition of\r
evolution systems (depending only on a time parameter) for the scale factors\r
and the dilatons, at each spatial point, with asymptotic freezing of the off\u0002diagonal and p-form variables. This ultralocal description of the dynamics\r
is valid only asymptotically. It would make no sense to speak of a billiard\r
motion prior to this limit, because one cannot replace the exponentials by\r
Θ-functions. Prior to this limit, the evolution system for the scale factors\r
involves the coefficients in front of the exponential terms, and the evolution\r
of these coefficients depends on various spatial gradients of the other degrees\r
of freedom. However, one may contemplate setting up an expansion in which\r
the sharp wall model is replaced by a model with exponential (“Toda-like”)\r
potentials, and where the evolution of the quantities entering the coefficients\r
of these “Toda walls” is treated as a next to leading effect. See [28] for\r
the definition of the first steps of such an expansion scheme for maximal\r
supergravity in eleven dimensions."""

At this point, we want to clarify an issue that might at first sight seem\r
paradoxical to the reader. In most of the BKL literature (notably in the\r
original analysis of [6, 8]), one tries to construct the metric in frames equal\r
(or close) to “Kasner frames”8. These are defined as frames with respect\r
to which both the spatial metric and the extrinsic curvature are diagonal.\r
Once the time slicing has been fixed, this geometric frame is unique, up\r
to time-dependent rescalings of each basis vector, when the eigenvalues of\r
the extrinsic curvature are distinct and some definite ordering of the (time\u0002independent) eigenvalues pa has been adopted. It is not clear how to fix in\r
a rigourous (and useful) manner the arbitrary time-dependent rescalings of\r
8We know, however, no detailed development of the Hamiltonian formalism within such\r
a frame whose definition involves both the metric variables and their conjugate momenta.\r
29

each basis vector. However, this can be done (following [7]) in an approximate\r
manner by considering the evolution of the geometry at each spatial point\r
as a succession of free Kasner flights interrupted by collisions against the\r
walls. More precisely, one can uniquely fix the normalization of the Kasner\r
frame by imposing two requirements: (i) that the Kasner frame be time\u0002independent during each Kasner epoch, i.e. that the Lie derivative of the\r
frame vectors along ∂/∂t be zero, and (ii) that the linear transformation\r
between two successive Kasner frames has the special form given in (5.35)\r
below (and not (5.35) up to some time-independent rescaling).\r
More explicitly, if we consider the three-dimensional case for definiteness\r
and denote the covariant components of the frame by {li, mi, ri}, one has\r
(suppressing the x-dependence)\r
gij (t) = A\r

, r′\r
i} are (in this approximation) independent of time, while\r
the scale factors Aa(t) vary like a power law during each Kasner free flight (say\r

pa during the first epoch, and Aa(t) ≈ b′\r
a\r
t\r

a during the next, with\r
some interpolating behaviour during the collision). Ref. [7] has argued (by\r
studying the effect of one collision in the “incoming” frame {li, mi, ri}, and\r
by rediagonalizing the “outgoing” metric) that the transformation between\r
the two successive Kasner frames could be written as:\r
l\r

i = li\r
, m′\r
i = mi + σmli\r
, r′\r
i = ri + σrli (5.35)\r
Here, σm and σr are quantities which can a priori be of order unity.\r
The seeming paradox is that according to [7] the σm and σr do not get\r
smaller for collisions closer to the singularity, so that the transformation\r
(5.35) from the old Kasner axes l to the new Kasner axes l\r
′\r
is of order one,\r
no matter how close one gets to the singularity; therefore, the Kasner axes\r
generically never “come to rest” if there is an infinite number of collisions. On\r
the other hand, as we just saw, the Iwasawa frames become approximately\r
time-independent for asymptotic values of τ , and the extrinsic curvature\r
approximately diagonal.\r
30

We now show that there is no contradiction between the oscillatory behav\u0002ior of the Kasner axes (in the generic inhomogeneous case) and the asymp\u0002totic freezing of the off-diagonal components N in the Iwasawa frame. The\r
key point is the very restricted form of the change (5.35) of the covariant\r
components during a collision. Recall first that the covariant components of\r
the Iwasawa frame are given the three covectors appearing as the three lines\r
of the matrix N , i.e. θ\r
1 = dx1 + n1dx2 + n2dx3\r
, θ2 = dx2 + n3dx3, θ3 = dx3.\r
[Note also in passing that, contrary to the Kasner frames, the Iwasawa frames\r
are not geometrically uniquely defined since one can redefine the coordinates\r
x\r
i\r
.]\r
Let us now see what (5.35) implies for the change in the Iwasawa variables.\r
For doing this we need to relate these to the li, mi, ni. This was done in\r
section 4.2 for the simple exact Kasner solution and is easy to generalize to\r
the case of an oscillatory metric. Indeed, when one is not in the “collision\r
region” (and this can be applied both before and after the specific collision\r
under consideration in (5.35)), the coordinate components of the metric take\r
the form (5.33) or (5.34) with A2\r
2 ≪ A21\r
and A2\r
3 ≪ A22\r
. As the definition of\r
the Iwasawa components na is purely algebraic, we can apply the formulas\r
(4.16)-(4.17) of section 4.2 to the present case. It suffices to replace t\r
pa by\r
Aa everywhere. Then, it is easy to see that n1, n2 and n3 are still given by\r
the same final formula as above, i.e\r
n1 =\r

i\r
in\r

namely, n\r

We have just seen that in the BKL limit, the evolution equations become\r
ordinary differential equations with respect to time. Although the spatial\r
points are decoupled in the evolution equations, they are, however, still cou\u0002pled via the constraints. These constraints just restrict the initial data and\r
need only be imposed at one time, since they are preserved by the dynamical\r
equations of motion. Indeed, one easily finds that, in the BKL limit,\r
H˙ = 0 (5.38)\r
since [H(x), H(x\r

)] = 0 in the ultralocal limit. This corresponds simply to\r
the fact that the collisions preserve the lightlike character of the velocity\r

since the Hamiltonian constraint is gauge-invariant. In the BKL limit, the\r
momentum constraint fulfills\r
H˙\r
k(x) = ∂kH ≈ 0 (5.39)\r
It is important that the restrictions on the initial data do not bring dangerous\r
constraints on the coefficients of the walls in the sense that these may all take\r
non-zero values. For instance, it is well known that it is consistent with the\r
Gauss law to take non-vanishing electric and magnetic energy densities; thus\r
the coefficients of the electric and magnetic walls are indeed generically non\u0002vanishing. In fact, the constraints are essentially conditions on the spatial\r
gradients of the variables entering the wall coefficients, not on these variables\r
themselves. In some non-generic contexts, however, the constraints could\r
force some of the wall coefficients to be zero; the corresponding walls would\r
thus be absent. [E.g., for vacuum gravity in four dimensions, the momentum\r
constraints for some Bianchi homogeneous models force some symmetry wall\r
coefficients to vanish. But this is peculiar to the homogeneous case.]\r
It is easy to see that the number of arbitrary physical functions involved\r
in the solution of the asymptotic BKL equations of motion is the same as\r
in the general solution of the complete Einstein-matter equations. Indeed,\r
the number of constraints on the initial data and the residual gauge freedom\r

The essential assumption in the BKL analysis, also made in the present pa\u0002per, is the asymptotic dominance of time derivatives with respect to space\r
derivatives near a spacelike singularity. This assumption has been mathe\u0002matically justified, in a rigorous manner, in the cases where the billiard is of\r
infinite volume, i.e. in the (simple) cases where the asymptotic behaviour is\r
not chaotic, but is monotonically Kasner-like [2, 29].\r
On the other hand, one might a priori worry that this assumption is\r
self-contradictory in those cases where the billiard is of finite volume, when\r
the asymptotic behaviour is chaotic, with an infinite number of oscillations.\r
Indeed, it has been pointed out [72, 4] that the independence of the billiard\r
evolution at each spatial point will have the effect of infinitely increasing\r
the spatial gradients of various quantities, notably of the local values of the\r
Kasner exponents pµ(x). This increase of spatial gradients towards the singu\u0002larity has been described as a kind of turbulent behaviour of the gravitational\r
field, in which energy is pumped into shorter and shorter length scales [72, 4],\r
and, if it were too violent, it would certainly work against the validity of the\r
BKL assumption of asymptotic dominance of time derivatives. For instance,\r
in our analysis of gravitational walls in the following section, we will en\u0002counter subleading walls, whose prefactors depend on spatial gradients of\r
the logarithmic scale factors β.\r
To address the question of consistency of the BKL assumption we need to\r
know how fast the spatial gradients of β, and of similar quantities entering\r
the prefactors, grow near the singularity. Let us consider the spatial gradient\r
of β ≡ ργ, which is\r
∂iβ = ρ∂iγ + ργ∂iλ (5.40)\r
As we are working here in the gauge (2.5), the spatial derivatives must be\r
taken with fixed T. We know that, asymptotically, λ is a linear function of\r
T, i.e. λ = a(x)T + b(x) where a(x) = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλ(x) is linked to the (spatially\r
dependent) conjugate momentum of λ. Therefore the spatial gradient ∂iλ =\r
T ∂ia(x) + ∂ib(x) behaves linearly in T, so that ∂iλ ∝ λ ≡ ln ρ. The second\r
term in (5.40) consequently behaves as γρ ln ρ when ρ → ∞. Let us now\r
estimate the first term (which will turn out to dominate the sum).\r
To estimate ∂iγ we can use the standard results on billiards on hyperbolic\r
space. Indeed, dxi∂iγ can be thought of as the infinitesimal deviation between\r
33

two billiard trajectories. The chaotic behaviour of the billiard implies that\r
this deviation will grow exponentially with T. In fact, because we work\r
on Hm with curvature −1 the Liapunov exponent for billiard trajectories is\r
equal to one, when using geodesic length as time parameter. Remembering\r

λ = π\r
2\r
γ\r
, the geodesic length is simply equal to\r
λ. This yields the growth estimate\r
∂iγ = O(1) exp λ = O(1)ρ (5.41)\r
where the coefficient O(1) is a chaotically oscillating quantity. This estimate\r
is not affected by the collisions against the walls because these preserve the\r
angles made by neighboring trajectories (the walls are hyperplanes). Insert\u0002ing (5.41) in (5.40), we see that the first term indeed dominates the second.\r
We conclude that the chaotic character of the billiard indeed implies an un\u0002limited growth of the spatial gradients of β, but that this growth is only of\r
polynomial order in ρ\r
∂iβ = O(1)ρ\r
2\r
. (5.42)\r
This polynomial growth of ∂iβ (and of its second-order spatial derivatives)\r
entails a polynomial growth of the prefactors of the sub-dominant walls in\r
section 6.2. Because it is polynomial (in ρ), this growth is, however, negligible\r
compared to the exponential (in ρ) behaviour of the various potential terms.\r
It does not jeopardize our reasoning based on keeping track of the various\r
exponential behaviours. As we will see the potentially dangerously growing\r
terms that we have controlled here appear only in subdominant walls. The\r
reasoning of the Appendix shows that the prefactors of the dominant walls\r
are self-consistently predicted to evolve very little near the singularity.\r
We conclude that the unlimited growth of some of the spatial gradients\r
does not affect the consistency of the BKL analysis done here. This does\r
not mean, however, that it will be easy to promote our analysis to a rigorous\r
mathematical proof. The main obstacle to such a proof appears to be the\r
existence of exceptional points, where a prefactor of a dominant wall happens\r
to vanish, or points where a subdominant wall happens to be comparable to\r
a dominant one. Though the set of such exceptional points is (generically)\r
of measure zero, their density might increase near the singularity because of\r
the increasing spatial gradients. This situation might be compared to the\r
KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) one, where the “bad” tori have a small\r
measure, but are interspersed densely among the “good” ones.\r

The last issue which we wish to address in this chapter concerns the relation\r
of the BKL limit to other limits considered in the literature, such as the\r
strong coupling limit, or the “small tension limit”, as well as the relation\r
with asymptotically velocity dominated solutions.\r
It is sometimes useful to separate the time derivatives (conjugate mo\u0002menta) in the Hamiltonian from the space derivatives, viz.\r
H = K\r
′ + εV′\r
(5.43)\r
where ε = ±1 according to whether the spacetime signature is Lorentzian\r
(ε = 1) or Euclidean (ε = −1). Here,\r
K\r
′ = H0 + VS + Vel\r
(p)\r
(5.44)\r
contains all the kinetic terms, and\r
V\r
′ = VG + V\r
magn\r
(p) + Vφ (5.45)\r
the terms with spatial derivatives. We stress that this split is different from\r
the one introduced in subsection 5.1, where only the kinetic terms of the\r
sclae factors and the dilatons were kept as such. The above split is useful\r
because for some models the asymptotic dynamics is entirely controlled by\r
K′, i.e., by the limit ε = 0. This happens whenever the billiard that emerges\r
in the BKL limit is defined by the symmetry and electric walls, as for in\u0002stance for D = 11 supergravity [24], or the pure Einstein-Maxwell system in\r
spacetime dimensions D ≥ 5 [25, 74]. Curvature and magnetic walls are then\r
subdominant, i.e., spatial gradients become negligible as one approaches the\r
singularity.\r
If the curvature and magnetic walls can be neglected, the evolution equa\u0002tions are exactly the same as the equations of motion obtained by performing\r
a direct torus reduction to 1 + 0 dimensions. We stress, however, that no ho\u0002mogeneity assumption has to be made here. The effective torus dimensional\r
reduction follows from the dynamics and is not imposed by hand.\r
The limit ε = 0 is known as the “zero signature limit” [97] and lies\r
half-way between spacetimes of Minkowskian or Lorentzian signature. It\r
corresponds to a vanishing velocity of light (or vanishing “medium tension”);\r
the underlying geometry is built on the Carroll contraction of the Lorentz\r
35

group [50]. The terminology “strong coupling” is also used [55] and stems\r
from the fact that, with appropriate rescalings, H can be rewritten as\r
H = GN K\r
′ + G−1\r
N V\r
′\r
(5.46)\r
such that the limit in question corresponds to large values of Newton’s con\u0002stant GN . The interest in this ultrarelativistic (“Carrollian”) limit has re\u0002cently been revived in [30, 78, 1] and [46].\r
If there are only finitely many collisions with the walls (corresponding to\r
a billiard of infinite volume) the dynamics in the vicinity of the singularity\r
becomes even simpler. After the last collision, the asymptotic dynamics is\r
controlled solely by the kinetic energy H0 of the scale factors. This case where\r
both spatial gradients and matter (here p-form) terms can be neglected,\r
has been called “asymptotically velocity-dominated” (or “AVD”) in [35] and\r
allows a rigorous analysis of its asymptotic dynamics by means of Fuchsian\r
techniques [2, 29]. By contrast, rigorous results are rare for the case of\r
infinitely many collisions (see, however, the recent analytic advances in [91]).\r
Besides the existing rigorous results, there also exists a wealth of numerical\r
support for the BKL ideas [10, 9]."""

We start by analyzing the effects of the off-diagonal metric components which\r
will give rise to the so-called “symmetry walls”. As they originate from the\r
gravitational action they are always present. The relevant contributions to\r
the potential is the centrifugal potential (5.18). When comparing (5.18) to\r
the general form (5.25) analyzed above, we see that firstly the summation\r
index A must be interpreted as a double index (a, b), with the restriction\r
a < b, secondly that the corresponding prefactor is cab = (P\r
j\r
aN b\r
j )\r

is auto\u0002matically non-negative (in accordance with our genericity assumptions, we\r

w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) ≡ w\r
S\r
(ab)µβ\r
µ ≡ βb − βa\r
(a < b). (6.1)\r
We refer to these wall forms as the “symmetry walls” for the following reason.\r
When applying the general collision law (7.3) derived below to the case of the\r
collision on the wall (6.1) one easily finds that its effect on the components of\r
the velocity vector v\r
µ\r
is simply to permute the components v\r
a and vb\r
, while\r
leaving unchanged the other components µ 6= a, b.\r
The hyperplanes w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) = 0 (i.e. the symmetry walls) are timelike since\r
G\r
µνwS\r
(ab)µw\r
S\r
(ab)ν = +2 (6.2)\r
This ensures that the symmetry walls intersect the hyperboloid Gµνβ\r
µβν =\r
−1, P\r
a\r
β\r
a ≥ 0. The symmetry billiard (in β-space) is defined to be the\r
region of Minkowski space determined by the inequalities\r
w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(β) ≥ 0, (6.3)\r
with P\r
a\r
β\r
a ≥ 0 (i.e. by the region of β-space where the Θ functions are\r
zero). Its projection on the hyperbolic space Hm is defined by the inequalities\r
w\r
S\r
(ab)\r
(γ) ≥ 0.\r
The explicit expressions above of the symmetry wall forms also allow us to\r
illustrate the notion of a “dominant wall” defined in subsection 5.2.1 above.\r
Indeed, the d(d − 1)/2 inequalities (6.3) already follow from the following\r
minimal set of d − 1 inequalities\r
β\r
2 − β1 ≥ 0, β3 − β2 ≥ 0, · · · , βd − βd−1 ≥ 0 (6.4)\r
More precisely, each linear form which must be positive in (6.3) can be written\r
as a linear combination, with positive (in fact, integer) coefficients of the\r
linear forms entering the subset (6.4). For instance, β\r
3 − β1 = (β3 − β2\r
) +\r
(β\r
2−β1\r
), etc. In the last section, we will reinterpret this result by identifying\r
the dominant linear forms entering (6.4) with the simple roots of SL(n, R).\r
Note that, in principle, the final set of dominant walls can only be decided\r
when one starts from the complete list of all the dynamically relevant walls.\r
In all the models we examine the set of dominant symmetry walls (6.4) will,\r
however, be part of the final minimal set of dominant walls defining the\r
complete billiard table."""

easily deduce from the above the following picture of the dynamics: When\r
the trajectory hits a wall β\r
a+1 = βa\r
from within the interior of the billiard\r
β\r
a+1 − βa > 0 it undergoes a reflection which reorders va+1 and va\r
from\r
the incident state v\r
a+1 < va\r
(in which β\r
a+1 − βa decreases towards zero)\r
into an outgoing state v\r
a+1 > va\r
(in which β\r
a+1 − βa\r

where v\r

· · · ≤ v\r
d and β1 ≤ β2\r
· · · ≤ β\r
d\r
. The motion would then\r
continue freely, i.e. without collisions, after the last reordering reflection.\r
The same conclusion was already reached in Section 4 by a direct calculation\r
of the dynamics of the Iwasawa scale factors of non-diagonal Kasner metrics\r
(which is, indeed, a case where only symmetry walls are present).\r
If we still consider for a moment the simple case of homogeneous but\r
non-diagonal metrics and recall that the metric can be diagonalized at all\r
times by a time-independent coordinate transformation x\r
i → x′i = Li\r
jx\r
j\r
, it\r
might appear that the symmetry walls, which are related to the off-diagonal\r
components, are only a gauge artifact with no true physical content. This\r
conclusion, however, would be incorrect. First, the transformation needed to\r
diagonalize the metric may not be a globally well-defined coordinate transfor\u0002mation if the spatial sections have non-trivial topology, e.g., are tori, since it\r
would conflict in general with periodicity conditions. Second, even if the spa\u0002tial sections are homeomorphic to R\r
d\r
, the transformation x\r
i → x′i = Li\r
jx\r
j\r
,\r
although a diffeomorphism, is not a proper gauge transformation in the sense\r
that it is generated by a non-vanishing charge, and therefore two solutions\r
that differ by such a transformation should be regarded as physically distinct\r
(although related by a symmetry). Initial conditions, for which the metric\r
is diagonal and hence the symmetry walls are absent, form a set of measure\r
zero.\r
Let us finally mention the possibility of alternative treatments of the\r
dynamics of off-diagonal metric components. We have just shown that the\r
Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric leads to a projected description\r
of the GL(d, R)/SO(d)-geodesics as motions in the space of the scale factors\r
with exponential (“Toda-like”) potentials. An alternative description can\r
be based on the decomposition G = RT A R of the spatial metric, where\r
R ∈ SO(d) and A is diagonal [92, 70]. One then gets Calogero-like potentials\r
∝ sinh−2(β\r
a − βb\r
). In the BKL limit, these potentials can be replaced by\r
sharp wall potentials but whether the system lies to the left or to the right\r

a − βb = 0 depends on the initial conditions in this alternative\r

that it is a polynomial of degree two in the derivatives ∂β and of degree one\r

respectively. Note that αabc is symmetric under the exchange of b with c, but\r
that the index a plays a special role.\r
Comparing the result (6.14) to the general form (5.25) we see that there\r
are, a priori, two types of gravitational walls: the α-type and the µ-type.\r
The α-type walls clearly come with positive prefactors, proportional to the\r
square of a structure function C\r
a\r
bc . The µ-type terms seem to pose a problem\r
because they do not have a definite sign. It would therefore seem that, in\r
the BKL limit, the gravitational potential would tend to\r

Θ[−2αabc(β)] +X\r

\u0010\r
± Θ[−2µa(β)]\u0011(6.17)\r
However, the indefinite µ-type terms can generically be neglected in the BKL\r
limit. This is most simply seen by noting that the inequalities αabc(β) ≥ 0\r
imply µa(β) ≥ 0 because µa is a linear combination with positive coefficients\r
of the αabc’s. Indeed, we can write µc = (αabc+αbca)/2. Therefore the α-walls\r
dominate the µ-ones.\r
In fact, one can establish a stronger result, namely µa(β) ≥ 0 within\r
the entire future light cone of the β’s. For this purpose, we note first that\r
each linear form µa(β) is lightlike, i.e. Gµν (µa)µ(µa)ν = 0. Therefore, each\r
hyperplane µa(β) = 0 is tangent to the light cone along some null generator.\r
This means that the future light cone is entirely on one side of the hyperplane\r
µa(β) = 0 (i.e., either µa(β) > 0 for all points inside the future light cone or\r
µa(β) < 0). Now, the point β\r
1 = β2 = · · · = βd = 1 is inside the future light\r
cone and makes all the µa’s positive. Hence µa(β) > 0 inside the future light\r
cone for each a and Θ[−2µa(β)] = 0, and we really have\r
lim\r
ρ→∞\r
VG =\r
X\r
a,b,c\r
′\r
Θ[−2αabc(β)]. (6.18)\r
Note, however, that the µ-type walls may make their existence felt in the\r
exceptional case when β is close to the lightlike direction defined by µ. This\r
is the case of “small oscillations” considered by BKL in [6, 8], for which they\r
verify (for d = 3) that the evolution is indeed controlled by the αabc-terms\r
even in that region."""

αabc(β) ≥ 0 (D > 3) (6.19)\r
besides the symmetry inequalities (6.4). The hyperplanes αabc(β) = 0 are\r
called the “curvature” or “gravitational” walls. Like the symmetry walls,\r
they are timelike since\r
G\r
µν (αabc)µ(αabc)ν = +2 (6.20)\r
The restriction D > 3 is due to the fact that in D = 3 spacetime dimensions,\r
the gravitational walls αabc(β) = 0 are absent, simply because one cannot\r
find three distinct spatial indices. In this case all gravitational walls are of\r
subdominant type µa and thus, in the BKL limit,\r
VG ≃\r
X\r
a\r
( ± Θ[−2µa(β)]) ≃ 0 (D = 3). (6.21)\r
This is, of course, in agreement with expectations, because gravity in three\r
spacetime dimensions has no propagating degrees of freedom (gravitational\r
waves).\r
The fact that the gravitational potential becomes, in the BKL limit, a\r
positive sum of sharp wall potentials, is remarkable for several reasons. First,\r
the final form of the potential is quite simple, even though the curvature is\r
a rather complicated function of the metric and its derivatives. Secondly,\r
the limiting expression of the potential is positive, even though there are\r
subdominant terms in VG with indefinite sign. Thirdly, it is ultralocal in the\r
scale factors, i.e. involves only the scale factors but not their derivatives. It\r
is this fact that accounts for the decoupling of the various spatial points.\r
The coefficients of the dominant exponentials involve only the undiffer\u0002entiated structure functions C\r
a\r
bc. Consequently, one can model the grav\u0002itational potential in leading order by spatially homogeneous cosmologies,\r
which have constant structure functions, and by considering homogeneity\r
groups that are “sufficiently non-abelian” so that none of the coefficients of\r
the relevant exponentials vanish (Bianchi types VIII and IX for d = 3, other\r
homogeneity groups for d > 3 - see [31]). By contrast, inspection of (6.13)\r
and (6.14) reveals that the subleading terms not only lack manifest positivity,\r
but also do depend on spatial inhomogeneities via the spatial gradient of the\r
structure functions, and the first and second spatial derivatives of the scale\r
42

factors. It is quite intriguing that the associated walls are lightlike, unlike\r
the walls associated with the leading terms all of which are timelike. Terms\r
involving lightlike walls will thus have to be taken into account in higher\r
orders of the BKL expansion. A Kac-Moody theoretic interpretation of this\r
fact was recently proposed in [28].\r
The computations in this subsection involve only the Cartan formulas.\r
They remain valid if in (4.8) we replace the one-forms dxi by some anholo\u0002nomic frame f\r
i = fi\r
j\r
(x)dxj. This modifies the Iwasawa frame {θ\r
a}, which\r
has no intrinsic geometrical meaning. The structure functions C\r
a\r
bc(x) of the\r
new frame get extra contributions from the spatial derivatives acting on f\r
i\r
.\r
In fact, for f\r
i = dxi not all gravitational walls αijk appear because from\r
(4.7) we then have C\r
d\r
bc = 0 for the top component (since θ\r
d = dxd\r
), and\r
C\r
d−1\r
bc = 0 b, c 6= d. Hence, the corresponding gravitational walls are absent.\r
To get all the gravitational walls, one therefore needs an anholonomic frame\r
f\r
i\r
. However, the dominant gravitational wall α1 d−1 d is always present, and\r
this is the one relevant for the billiard, when gravitational walls are relevant\r
at all.\r
6.3 p-form walls\r
While none of the wall forms considered so far involved the dilatons, the\r

the same exponentials. The only difference is that the wall coefficients are\r
different functions of the p-form canonical variables; but this difference is\r
again washed out in the sharp wall limit, where the coefficients can be re\u0002placed by one (provided they are different from zero). The momentum and\r
Gauss constraints are genuinely different and impose different conditions on\r
the initial data.\r
Nevertheless, the Chern-Simons terms may play a more significant rˆole in\r
peculiar contexts when only specialized field configurations are considered.\r
This occurs for instance in [58], where it is shown that the D = 11 super\u0002gravity Chern-Simons term for spatially homogeneous metrics and magnetic\r

Let us summarize our findings. The dynamics in the vicinity of a space\u0002like singularity is governed by the scale factors, while the other variables\r
(off-diagonal metric components, p-form fields) tend to become mere “spec\u0002tators” which get asymptotically frozen. This simple result is most easily\r
derived in terms of the hyperbolic polar coordinates (ρ, γ), and in the gauge\r
(2.5). In this picture, the essential dynamics is carried by the angular vari\u0002ables γ which move on a fixed billiard table, with cushions defined by the\r
dominant walls wA′(γ). However, it is often geometrically more illuminat\u0002ing to “unproject” this billiard motion in the full Minkowski space of the\r
extended scale factors β\r
µ\r
. In that picture, the asymptotic evolution of the\r
47

scale factors at each spatial point reduces to a zigzag of null straight lines\r
w.r.t. the metric Gµνdβµdβν. The straight segments of this motion are in\u0002terrupted by collisions against the sharp walls\r
wA(β) ≡ wAµβ\r
µ = 0 (7.1)\r
defined by the symmetry, gravitational and p-form potentials, respectively.\r
As we showed all these walls are timelike, i.e. they have spacelike gradients:\r
G\r
µνwAµwAν > 0 (7.2)\r
Indeed, the gradients of the symmetry and gravitational wall forms have\r
squared norm equal to +2, independently of the dimension d. By contrast,\r
the norms of the electric and magnetic gradients, which are likewise positive,\r
depend on the model. As we saw, there also exist subdominant walls, which\r
can be neglected as they are located “behind” the dominant walls.\r
In the β-space picture, the free motion before a collision is described by\r
a null straight line of the type of (3.21), with the constraint (3.22). The\r
effect of a collision on a particular wall wA(β) is easily obtained by solving\r
(5.31), or (5.32), with only one term in the sum. This dynamics is exactly\r
integrable: it suffices to decompose the motion of the β-particle into two\r
(linear) components: (i) the component parallel to the (timelike) wall hyper\u0002plane, and (ii) the orthogonal component. One easily finds that the parallel\r
motion is left unperturbed by the presence of the wall, while the orthogonal\r
motion suffers a (one-dimensional) reflection, with a change of the sign of the\r
outgoing orthogonal velocity with respect to the ingoing one. The net effect\r
of the collision on a certain wall w(β) then is to change the ingoing velocity\r
vector v\r
µ\r
entering the ingoing free motion (3.21) into an outgoing velocity\r

Here, all scalar products, and index raisings, are done with the β-space metric\r
Gµν. Note that the collision law (7.3) leaves invariant the (Minkowski) length\r
of the vector v\r
µ\r
. Because the dominant walls are timelike, the geometric\r
reflections that the velocities undergo during a collision, are elements of the\r
orthochronous Lorentz group. Each reflection preserves the norm and the\r
time-orientation; hence, the velocity vector remains null and future-oriented."""

walls which are not timelike. Lightlike walls (like some of the subleading\r
gravitational walls) can never cause reflections because in order to hit them\r
the billiard ball would have to move at superluminal speeds in violation of the\r
Hamiltonian constraint. The effect of spacelike walls (like the cosmological\r
constant wall) is again different: they are either irrelevant (if they are “be\u0002hind the motion”), or otherwise they reverse the time-orientation inducing a\r
motion towards increasing spatial volume (“bounce”).\r
The hyperbolic billiard is obtained from the β-space picture by a radial\r
projection onto the unit hyperboloid of the piecewise straight motion in the\r
polywedge defined by the walls. The straight motion thereby becomes a\r
geodesic motion on hyperbolic space. The “cushions” of the hyperbolic bil\u0002liard table are the intersections of the hyperplanes (7.1) with the unit hy\u0002perboloid, such that the billiard motion is constrained to be in the region\r
defined as the intersection of the half-spaces wA(β) ≥ 0 with the unit hyper\u0002boloid. As we already emphasized, not all walls are relevant since some of the\r
inequalities wA(β) ≥ 0 are implied by others [26]. Only the dominant wall\r
forms, in terms of which all the other wall forms can be expressed as linear\r
combinations with non-negative coefficients, are relevant for determining the\r
billiard. Usually, these are the minimal symmetry walls and some of the p\u0002form walls. The billiard region, as a subset of hyperbolic space, is in general\r
non-compact because the cushions meet at infinity (i.e. at a cusp); in terms\r
of the original scale factor variables β, this means that the corresponding\r
hyperplanes intersect on the lightcone. It is important that, even when the\r
billiard is non-compact, the hyperbolic region can have finite volume.\r
Given the action (2.1) with definite spacetime dimension, menu of fields\r
and dilaton couplings, one can determine the relevant wall forms and compute\r
the billiards. For generic initial conditions, we have the following results, as\r
to which of the models (2.1) exhibit oscillatory behaviour (finite volume\r
billiard) or Kasner-like behaviour (infinite volume billiard)\r
• Pure gravity billiards have finite volume for spacetime dimension D ≤\r
10 and infinite volume for spacetime dimension D ≥ 11 [33]. This can\r
be understood in terms of the underlying Kac-Moody algebra [27]: as\r
shown there, the system is chaotic precisely if the underlying indefinite\r
Kac-Moody algebra is hyperbolic.\r
• The billiard of gravity coupled to a dilaton always has infinite volume,\r
hence exhibits Kasner-like behavior [5, 2, 29].\r
49

• If gravity is coupled to p-forms (with p 6= 0 and p < D − 2) with\u0002out a dilaton the corresponding billiard has a finite volume [25]. The\r
most prominent example in this class is D = 11 supergravity, whereas\r
vacuum gravity in 11 dimensions is Kasner-like. The 3-form is crucial\r
for closing the billiard. Similarly, the Einstein-Maxwell system in four\r
(in fact any number of) dimensions has a finite-volume billiard (see\r
[60, 75, 99] for a discussion of four-dimensional homogeneous models\r
with Maxwell fields exhibiting oscillatory behaviour).\r
• The volume of the mixed Einstein-dilaton-p-form system depends on\r
the dilaton couplings. For a given spacetime dimension D and a given\r
menu of p-forms there exists a subcritical domain D in the space of\r
the dilaton couplings, i.e. an open neighbourhood of the origin λp = 0\r
such that: (i) when the dilaton couplings λp belong to D the general\r
behaviour is Kasner-like, but (ii) when the λp do not belong to D\r
the behaviour is oscillatory [24, 29]. For all the superstring models,\r
the dilaton couplings do not belong to the subcritical domain and the\r
billiard has finite volume. Note, however, that the superstring dilaton\r
couplings are precisely “critical”, i.e. on the borderline between the\r
subcritical and the overcritical domain.\r
As a note of caution let us point out that some indicators of chaos must\r
be used with care in general relativity, because of reparametrization invari\u0002ance, and in particular redefinitions of the time coordinate; see [18, 54] for a\r
discussion of the original Bianchi IX model.\r
We next discuss the link between the various time coordinates used in\r
the analysis. When working in the gauge (2.5), the basic time coordinate\r
is T. Let us see how the other time coordinates depend on T. First, we\r
note that the dynamical variable λ is asymptotically a linear function of T.\r
Indeed, its conjugate momentum πλ < 0 is asymptotically constant, so that\r
the integration of dλ/dT = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλ yields\r
λ = −\r
1\r
2\r
πλT + const. (7.4)\r
Hence ρ is an exponential function of T:\r
ρ = exp λ ∝ exp(−\r
1\r
2\r
πλT) (7.5)\r
From this behavior we infer the time dependence of the intermediate time\r
coordinate τ by integrating its defining relation dτ = ρ\r
2dT = −(2/πλ)ρ2dλ =\r
50

−(2/πλ)ρdρ. This yields\r
τ = −(1/πλ)ρ\r
2 + const. (7.6)\r
At this stage, the asymptotic links between T, τ, λ and ρ are similar to the\r
results derived above for a Kasner solution and does not depend on whether\r
the system is chaotic or non-chaotic.\r
The situation is more subtle for the proper time t in the chaotic case\r
(in the non-chaotic case where one settles in a Kasner regime after a finite\r
number of collisions, nothing is changed, of course). The proper time is\r
obtained by integrating\r
dt =\r
√\r
gdτ =\r
√\r
gρ2\r
dT = −(2/πλ)\r
√\r
gρdρ. (7.7)\r
The main term in the integrand is √g = exp(−ρσ), where σ ≡ Σiγ\r
i\r
. The\r
quantity σ oscillates chaotically and is difficult to control. As argued in [69],\r
however, one nevertheless gets (in the four-dimensional case) the usual Kas\u0002ner relation √g ∼ t (and thus τ ∼ ln t and T ∼ ln | ln t|) up to subdominant\r
corrections. We refer the interested reader to [69] for the details.\r
Concerning the frequency of collisions, note that the billiard picture\r
makes it clear that the typical time interval between two collisions is con\u0002stant as a function of T. In other words, the number of collisions goes like\r
λ ≈\r
1\r

ln τ ∼ ln | ln t|.\r
The hyperbolic billiard description of the (3+1)-dimensional homoge\u0002neous Bianchi IX system was first worked out by Chitre [17] and Misner\r
[84]. It was subsequently generalized to inhomogeneous metrics in [71, 56].\r
The extension to higher dimensions with perfect fluid sources was considered\r
in [73], without symmetry walls. Exterior p-form sources were investigated\r
in [57, 58] for special classes of metric and p-form configurations. As far as\r

a systematic use of the Iwasawa decomposition of the spatial metric is new."""

Although the billiard description holds for all systems governed by the ac\u0002tion (2.1), the billiard in general has no notable regularity property. In\r
particular, the dihedral angles between the faces, which can depend on the\r
(continuous) dilaton couplings, need not be integer submultiples of π. In\r
51

some instances, however, the billiard can be identified with the fundamental\r
Weyl chamber of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody (or KM) algebra of indefi\u0002nite type9\r
, with Lorentzian signature metric [26, 27, 23]. Such billiards are\r
called “Kac-Moody billiards”. More specifically, in [26], superstring models\r
were considered and the rank 10 KM algebras E10 and BE10 were shown to\r
emerge, in line with earlier conjectures made in [62, 64]10. This result was\r
further extended to pure gravity in any number of spacetime dimensions, for\r
which the relevant KM algebra is AEd, and it was understood that chaos\r
(finite volume of the billiard) is equivalent to hyperbolicity of the underlying\r
Kac-Moody algebra [27]. For pure gravity in D = 4 the relevant algebra\r
is the hyperbolic algebra AE3 first investigated in [38]. Further examples\r
of emergence of Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras, based on the models of\r
[13, 21], are given in [23].\r
The main feature of the gravitational billiards that can be associated\r
with KM algebras is that there exists a group theoretical interpretation of\r
the billiard motion: the asymptotic BKL dynamics is equivalent (in a sense to\r
be made precise below), at each spatial point, to the asymptotic dynamics of\r
a one-dimensional nonlinear σ-model based on a certain infinite dimensional\r
coset space G/K, where the KM group G and its maximal compact subgroup\r
K depend on the specific model. As we have seen, the walls that determine\r
the billiards are the dominant walls. For KM billiards, they correspond\r
to the simple roots of the KM algebra. Some of the subdominant walls\r
also have an algebraic interpretation in terms of higher-height positive roots.\r
This enables one to go beyond the BKL limit and to see the beginnings of\r
a possible identification of the dynamics of the scale factors and of all the\r
remaining variables with that of a non-linear σ-model defined on the cosets\r
of the Kac-Moody group divided its maximal compact subgroup [28].\r
The KM theoretic reformulation will not only enable us to give a unified\r
group theoretical derivation of the different types of walls discussed in the\r
preceding section, but also shows that the β-space of logarithmic scale fac\u0002tors, in which the billard motion takes place, can be identified with the Cartan\r
subalgebra of the underlying indefinite Kac-Moody algebra. The various types\r
of walls can thus be understood directly as arising from the large field limit\r
of the corresponding σ-models. It is the presence of gravity, which comes\r
9Throughout this chapter, we will use the abbreviations “KM” for “Kac-Moody”, and\r
“CSA” for Cartan subalgebra.\r

the context of U-duality [79, 89, 3].\r

with a metric in scale-factor space of Lorentzian signature, which forces us\r
to consider infinite dimensional groups if we want to recover all the walls\r
found in our previous analysis, and this is the main reason we need the the\u0002ory of KM algebras. For finite dimensional Lie algebras we obtain only a\r
subset of the walls: one of the cushions of the associated billiard is missing,\r
and one always ends up with a monotonic Kasner-type behavior in the limit\r
t → 0\r
+ (for instance, the non-diagonal Kasner solution discussed in chapter 4\r
has only symmetry walls corresponding to the finite dimensional coset space\r
GL(d, R)/SO(d)). The absence of chaotic oscillations for models based on\r
finite dimensional Lie groups is consistent with the classical integrability of\r
these models. While they remain formally integrable for infinite dimensional\r
KM groups, one can understand the chaotic behavior as resulting from the\r
projection of a motion in an infinite dimensional space onto a finite dimen\u0002sional subspace.\r
Before proceeding we should like to emphasize that the equivalence be\u0002tween the models discussed in the foregoing sections and the KM σ-models\r
to be presented in this section has so far only been established, in the case\r
of general models, for their asymptotic dynamics. A proposal relating the\r
infinitely many off-diagonal degrees of freedom arising in the KM σ-model\r
to spatial gradients of the metric and other fields, as well as possibly other\r
degrees of freedom has recently been made in [28]. The first steps of this\r
proposal have been explicitly checked for the relation between D = 11 su\u0002pergravity and the E10 σ-model. The relevance of non-linear σ-models for\r
uncovering the symmetries of M-theory has also been discussed from a dif\u0002ferent, spacetime-covariant point of view in [100, 95, 96], but there it is E11\r
rather than E10 that has been proposed as a fundamental symmetry."""

We first summarize some basic results from the theory of KM algebras, refer\u0002ring the reader to [66, 85] for comprehensive treatments. As explained there,\r
every KM algebra g ≡ g(A) is defined by means of an integer-valued Cartan\r
matrix A and a set of generators and relations [66, 85]. We shall assume that\r
the Cartan matrix is symmetrizable since this is the case encountered for cos\u0002mological billiards. The Cartan matrix can then be written as (i, j = 1, . . . r,\r
53

with r denoting the rank of g(A))\r
Aij =\r
2hαi|αj i\r
hαi|αii\r
(8.1)\r
where {αi} is a set of r simple roots, and where the angular brackets denote\r
the invariant symmetric bilinear form of g(A) [66]. Here the bilinear form\r
acts on the roots, which are linear forms on the Cartan subalgebra (CSA)\r
h ⊂ g(A). The generators, which are also referred to as Chevalley-Serre\r
generators, consist of triples {hi, ei, fi} with i = 1, . . . , r, and for each i form\r
an sl(2, R) subalgebra. The CSA h is then spanned by the elements hi, so\r
that\r
[hi, hj] = 0 (8.2)\r
Furthermore,\r
[ei, fj] = δijhj (8.3)\r
and\r
[hi, ej] = Aijej, [hi, fj] = −Aijfj (8.4)\r
so that the value of the linear form αj, corresponding to the raising operator\r
ej, on the element hi of the preferred basis {hi} of h is αj (hi) = Aij . More\r
abstractly, and independently of the choice of any basis in the CSA, the roots\r
appear as eigenvalues of the adjoint action of any element h of the CSA on the\r
raising (ei) or lowering (fi) generators: [h, ei] = +αi(h)ei, [h, fi] = −αi(h)fi.\r
Last but not least we have the so-called Serre relations\r
ad (ei)\r
1−Aij (ej ) = 0 , ad (fi)1−Aij (fj ) = 0 (8.5)\r
Every KM algebra possesses the triangular decomposition\r
g(A) = n\r
− ⊕ h ⊕ n+ (8.6)\r
where n\r
+ and n−, respectively, are spanned by the multiple commutators of\r
the ei and fi which do not vanish on account of the Serre relations and the\r
Jacobi identity. To be completely precise, n\r
+ is the quotient of the free Lie\r
algebra generated by the ei’s by the ideal generated by the Serre relations\r
(idem for n\r
− and fi). In more mundane terms, when the algebra is realized, in\r
a suitable basis, by infinite dimensional matrices, n\r
+ and n− simply consist\r
of the “nilpotent” matrices with nonzero entries only above or below the\r
diagonal. Exponentiating them formally, one obtains infinite dimensional\r
54

matrices again with nonzero entries above or below the diagonal, and 1’s on\r
the diagonal – as exemplified in the finite dimensional case by the matrices\r
N in chapter 4.\r
One of the main results of the theory is that, for positive definite A,\r
one just recovers from these relations Cartan’s list of finite dimensional Lie\r
algebras (see e.g. [53] for a clear introduction). For non positive-definite A,\r
on the other hand, the associated KM algebras are infinite dimensional. If\r
A has only one zero eigenvalue (with all other eigenvalues strictly positive)\r
one obtains the so-called affine algebras, whose structure and properties are\r
rather well understood [66, 47]. For indefinite A (i.e. at least one negative\r
eigenvalue of A), on the other hand, very little is known, and it remains an\r
outstanding problem to find a manageable representation for them [66, 85]\r
(see also [44] for a physicist’s introduction). In particular, there is not a\r
single example of an indefinite KM algebra for which the root multiplicities,\r
i.e. the number of Lie algebra elements associated with a given root, are\r
known in closed form. The scarcity of results is even more acute for the\r
“Kac-Moody groups” obtained by formal exponentiation of the associated\r
Lie algebras. In spite of these caveats, we will proceed formally, making sure\r
that our definitions reduce to the standard formulas in the truncation to\r
finite dimensional Lie groups, and more generally remain well defined when\r
we restrict the number of degrees of freedom to any finite subset.\r
In the remainder we will thus assume A to be Lorentzian, i.e. non\u0002degenerate and indefinite, with one negative eigenvalue. We shall see that\r
this choice is physically motivated by the fact that the negative eigenvalue\r
can be associated with the conformal factor which, as we saw, is the one\r
degree of freedom making the reduced Einstein action unbounded from be\u0002low. As a special, and important case, this class of Lorentzian KM algebras\r
includes hyperbolic KM algebras whose Cartan matrices are such that the\r
deletion of any node from the Dynkin diagram leaves either a finite or an\r
affine subalgebra, or a disjoint union of them.\r
The “maximal compact” subalgebra k is defined as the invariant subalge\u0002bra of g(A) under the standard Chevalley involution, i.e.\r
θ(x) = x for all x ∈ k (8.7)\r
with\r
θ(hi) = −hi, θ(ei) = −fi, θ(fi) = −ei (8.8)\r
More explicitly, it is the subalgebra generated by multiple commutators of\r
(ei − fi). For finite dimensional g(A), the inner product induced on the\r
55

maximal compact subalgebra k is negative-definite, and the orthogonal com\u0002plement to k has a positive definite inner product. This is not so, however,\r
for indefinite A (see the footnote on page 438 of [65]).\r
It will be convenient in the following to introduce the operation of trans\u0002position acting on any Lie algebra element E as\r
E\r
T\r
:= −θ(E) (8.9)\r
In this notation the relations above become h\r
T\r
i = hi\r

i = fi\r

i = ei\r
, and the\r
subalgebra k is generated by the “anti-symmetric” elements satisfying E\r
T =\r
−E. After exponentiation, the elements of the corresponding maximally\r
compact subgroup K formally appear as “orthogonal matrices” obeying k\r
T =\r
k\r
−1\r
.\r
Sometimes it is convenient to use a so-called Cartan-Weyl basis for g(A).\r
Using Greek indices µ, ν, . . . to label the root components corresponding to\r
an arbitrary basis Hµ in the CSA, with the usual summation convention and\r
a Lorentzian metric Gµν for an indefinite g, we have hi:= α\r
µ\r
i Hµ, where\r
α\r

are the “contravariant components”, Gµνα\r

i ≡ αi µ, of the simple roots\r
αi (i = 1, . . . r), which are linear forms on the CSA, with usual “covariant\r
components” defined as αi µ ≡ αi(Hµ).\r
To an arbitrary root α corresponds a set of Lie-algebra generators Eα,s,\r
where s = 1, . . . , mult (α) labels the (in general) multiple Lie-algebra ele\u0002ments associated with α. The root multiplicity mult (α) is always one for\r
finite dimensional Lie algebras, and is also one for the positive norm roots\r
α\r
2 ≡ hα|αi > 0 (i.e. the “real roots”) of general KM algebras (including, of\r
course, the simple roots), but generically exhibits exponential growth as a\r
function of −α\r

for indefinite A. In this notation, the remaining Chevalley\u0002Serre generators are given by ei\r

and work out the first few terms of its decomposition into SL(3, R) repre\u0002sentations. This decomposition refers to the adjoint action of the sl(3, R)\r
subalgebra defined below on the complete KM algebra.\r
From the mathematical point of view, the algebra (8.13) was first studied\r
in [38] as it is the simplest hyperbolic KM algebra containing a non-trivial\r
affine subalgebra (see also [68] and references therein for more recent work).\r
From the physical perspective this algebra is of special interest for pure grav\u0002ity in four dimensions both because its regular subalgebras and its Chevalley\u0002Serre generators can be physically identified with known symmetry groups\r
arising in dimensional reductions of general relativity [86], and because its\r
Weyl chamber is related to the original BKL billiard [27] (see footnote 12).\r
First of all, the SL(2, R) subgroup corresponding to the third diagonal entry\r
of Aij can be identified with the Ehlers group [37] which acts on solutions\r
of Einstein’s equations with one Killing vector. The affine subgroup corre\u0002sponding to the submatrix\r
\u0012\r
2 −2\r

(8.14)\r
is the Geroch group acting on solutions of Einstein’s equations with two com\u0002muting Killing vectors [42] (axisymmetric stationary, or colliding plane wave\r
solutions, respectively), see e.g. [62, 63, 12, 87] and references therein. Both\r
the Ehlers group and the Geroch group act in part by nonlocal transforma\u0002tions on the metric (or vierbein) components.\r
A crucial role, in our analysis, is played by the SL(3, R) subgroup gener\u0002ated by (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2), corresponding to the submatrix\r

(or vierbein), as an extension of the so-called Matzner-Misner SL(2, R) group\r
for solutions with two commuting Killing vectors.\r
The billiard picture for pure gravity in four dimensions can be readily\r
understood in terms of the Weyl group of AE3 [27]. For SL(3, R), which\r
has two simple roots, the Weyl group is the permutation group on three\r
objects. The two hyperplanes orthogonal to the simple roots of SL(3, R) can\r
be identified with the symmetry walls encountered in section 6.1. The third\r
simple root extending (8.15) to the full rank 3 algebra (8.13), which “closes\r
off” the billiard, can then be identified with curvature wall orthogonal to\r
α123 [27]. Readers may indeed check that the scalar products between the\r
two symmetry wall forms and the curvature wall form reproduce the above\r
Cartan matrix12.\r
Let us now expand the nilpotent subalgebra n\r
+ in terms of representations\r
of the A2 ≡ sl(3, R) subalgebra of AE3 exhibited in (8.15). For this purpose,\r
given any root α, we define its sl(3, R) level ℓ to be the number of times the\r
root α3 appears in it, to wit\r
α = mα1 + nα2 + ℓα3 (8.16)\r
Note that this notion of level is different from the affine level (≡ m) which\r
counts the number of appearances of the over-extended root α1 [38]. The\r
hyperbolic algebra is thus decomposed into an infinite tower of irreducible\r
representations of its sl(3, R) subalgebra. Such a decomposition is simpler\r
than one in terms of the affine subalgebra, whose representation theory is\r
far more complicated (and, unlike that of sl(3, R), only incompletely under\u0002stood).\r
After inclusion of the third Cartan generator h3, the level ℓ = 0 sector\r
is just a gl(3, R) subalgebra with generators Ki\r

manifestly showing how the over-extended CSA generator h3 enlarges the\r
original sl(3, R) generated by (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2) to the Lie algebra\r
gl(3, R). The CSA generators are related to the “central charge” generator\r
c by\r
c = h2 + h3 = −K1\r
1 (8.20)\r
This is indeed the expected result: in the reduction of gravity to two dimen\u0002sions (i.e. with two commuting Killing vectors), the central charge does not\r
act on the internal degrees of freedom, but as a scaling on the conformal\r
factor [63, 12, 87] (here realized as the 1-1 component of the vierbein). The\r
affine level counting operator d is given by [38]\r
d = h1 + h2 + h3 = −K2\r
2 (8.21)\r
and in contradistinction to c it does act on the internal volume in the reduc\u0002tion to two dimensions (i.e. the “dilaton” ρ in the notation of [12, 87]). The\r
operator d may be viewed as the L0 operator of a full Witt-Virasoro algebra\r
enlarging the Geroch group via a semidirect product [65].\r
The irreducible representations of SL(3, R) are most conveniently charac\u0002terized by their Dynkin labels. Let us recall that these labels are non-negative\r
integers which characterize any highest-weight representation of any finite\u0002dimensional Lie algebra. Let us consider a representation with maximal\r
vector vΛ, of (highest) weight Λ, i.e. such that for any element h in the\r
CSA, h(vΛ) = Λ(h)vΛ, where the Lie algebra acts on the representation vec\u0002tor space (or “module”), and where Λ is a linear form on the CSA. The\r
Dynkin labels of this representation are defined as pi(Λ) ≡ 2hαi|Λi/hαi|αii,\r
where αi are simple roots of the Lie algebra under consideration.Note that\r
59

in the case of simply laced algebras such as sl(3, R), and AE3, the simple\r
roots have all a squared length equal to 2, so that the definition of the labels\r
reduces to pi(Λ) = hαi|Λi (while the Cartan matrix similarly simplifies to\r
Aij = hαi|αj i). In the case of sl(3, R) we have two simple roots, α1 and α2,\r
and therefore two Dynkin labels: p1(Λ) = hα1|Λi, p2(Λ) = hα2|Λi. In terms\r
of the Young tableau description of sl(3, R) representations, the first Dynkin\r
label p1 counts the number of columns having two boxes, while p2 counts\r
the number of columns having only one box. For instance, (p1, p2) = (1, 0)\r
labels an antisymmetric two-index tensor, while (p1, p2) = (0, 2) denotes a\r
symmetric two-index tensor. Note also that the dimension of the sl(3, R) rep\u0002resentation described by the labels (p1, p2) is (p1 + 1)(p2 + 1)(p1 + p2 + 2)/2.\r
Let us determine the representations of sl(3, R) appearing at the first level\r

sl(3, R), i.e. of (e1, f1, h1) and (e2, f2, h2), the extra Chevalley-Serre generator\r
f3 is a maximal vector. Indeed,\r
e1(f3) ≡ [e1, f3] = 0\r
e2(f3) ≡ [e2, f3] = 0 (8.22)\r
The weight of f3 is Λ = −α3 because, by definition h(f3) ≡ [h, f3] =\r
−α3(h)f3. Hence the Dynkin labels of the representation built on the maxi\u0002mal vector f3 are pi = −hαi\r
|α3i = −Ai3 with i = 1, 2. Explicitly, this gives\r
(p1, p2) = (0, 2). These labels also show up as the eigenvalues of the actions of\r
the (specially normalized) Cartan generators (h1, h2) on the maximal vector\r
f3, namely:\r
h1(f3) ≡ [h1, f3] = 0\r
h2(f3) ≡ [h2, f3] = 2f3 (8.23)\r

As one proceeds to higher levels, the classification of SL(3, R) represen\u0002tations becomes rapidly more complicated due to the exponential increase\r
in the number of representations with level ℓ. Generally, the representations\r
that can occur at level ℓ + 1 must be contained in the product of the level-ℓ\r
representations with the level-one representation (0, 2). Working out these\r
products is elementary, but cumbersome. Moreover, many of the represen\u0002tations constructed in this way will drop out (i.e. not appear as elements of\r
the AE3 Lie algebra). The complications are not yet visible at low levels;\r
for instance, the level-two generator Eab|jk ≡ ε\r
abiEi\r
jk, with labels (1, 2), is\r
straightforwardly obtained by commuting two level-one elements\r
[E\r
ij , Ekl] = εmk(iEm\r

ml(iEm\r
j)k\r
(8.26)\r
A more economical way to sift the relevant representations is to work out\r
the relation between Dynkin labels and the associated highest weights, using\r
the fact that the highest weights of the adjoint representation are the roots.\r
More precisely, the maximal vectors being (as exemplified above at level 1) of\r
the “lowering type”, the corresponding highest weights are negative roots, say\r
Λ = −α with α of the form (8.16) with non-negative integers ℓ, m, n. Working\r
out the Dynkin labels of Λ = −α by computing, the scalar products with the\r
two simple roots of sl(3, R) then yields\r
p1 ≡ p = n − 2m , p2 ≡ q = 2ℓ + m − 2n (8.27)\r
As indicated, we shall henceforth use the notation (p1, p2) ≡ (p, q) for the\r
Dynkin labels. This formula is restrictive because all the integers entering it\r
must be non-negative.\r

non-negative integers and the highest weight Λ is a root, i.e. Λ2 ≤ 2. These\r
simple diophantine equations/inequalities can be easily evaluated by hand\r
up to rather high levels.\r
However, the task is not finished. Although the above procedure sub\u0002stantially reduces the number of possibilities, it does not tell us how often\r
(including zero times!) a given representation appears (i.e. its outer multi\u0002plicity). For this purpose we have to make use of more detailed information\r
about AE3, namely the root multiplicities computed in [38, 66]. Matching\r
the combined weight diagrams with the root multiplicities listed in table H3\r
on page 215 of [66], we obtain the following representations in the decompo\u0002sition of AE3 w.r.t. its sl(3, R) subalgebra up to level ℓ ≤ 5:\r
ℓ = 1 → (p, q) = (0, 2)\r
ℓ = 2 → (p, q) = (1, 2)\r

(0, 1) (occurs twice) (8.30)\r
(we have not listed the representations compatible with (8.28) and (8.29),\r
which drop out, i.e. have outer multiplicity zero). Going to yet higher\r
levels will require knowledge of AE3 root multiplicities beyond those listed\r
in [38, 66, 68]. There is, however, an infinite set of admissible Dynkin labels\r
62

that can be readily identified by searching for “affine” highest weights for\r
which m = 0 in (8.16). They are\r
(p, q) = (ℓ − 1, 2) ⇐⇒ (m, n) = (0, ℓ − 1) (8.31)\r
Because the associated highest weights all obey Λ2 = 2 all these representa\u0002tions (and their “transposed” representations) appear with outer multiplicity\r
one independently of ℓ. A second series of affine representations is\r
(p, q) = (ℓ, 0) ⇐⇒ (m, n) = (0, ℓ) (8.32)\r
Now we have Λ2 = 0, and the corresponding representations have outer\r
multiplicity zero because the corresponding states are already contained as\r
lower weight states in the rperesentations (8.31).\r
The Lie algebra elements corresponding to (8.31) are thus given by the\r

view of future applications and because the identification is a little subtle\r
we here spell out some more details. The affine subalgebra is identified by\r
requiring its elements to commute with the central charge c (8.20). ¿From\r
this requirement we infer that we must truncate the full algebra to the sub\u0002algebra generated by the elements Ki\r
j\r
for i, j ∈ {2, 3} and those generators\r
in (8.33) with i1 = . . . iℓ−1 = 1 and j, k ∈ {2, 3}. In physicists’ notation, the\r

and the central charge c. The affine level m ∈ Z is the eigenvalue of the\r

Notwithstanding the fact that we know even less about the “groups” asso\u0002ciated with indefinite KM algebras we will formulate nonlinear σ-models in\r
one time dimension and thereby provide an effective and unified description\r
of the asymptotic BKL dynamics for several physically important models.\r
The basic object of interest is a one-parameter dependent KM group ele\u0002ment V = V(t), which is assumed to be an element of the coset space G/K,\r
where G is the group obtained by formal exponentiation of the KM algebra\r
g, and K its maximal compact subgroup, which is again obtained by for\u0002mal exponentiation of the associated maximal compact subalgebra k defined\r

formal constructs to begin with. [Formal constructs similar to our objects V,\r
VV˙ −1, etc. have been used in somewhat different settings in [19, 20, 100].]\r
However, to ensure that our definitions are meaningful operationally, we will\r
make sure at every step that any finite truncation of the model is well defined\r

local Lorentz symmetries of general relativity. For infinite dimensional G,\r

the object V thus becomes an “∞-bein”. It is then natural to associate to\r

We anticipated this correspondence by using the same notation. [As ex\u0002plained above, the apparently “wrong sign” of the exponents of A is due to\r
the fact that M will correspond to the inverse of the spatial metric.] The\r
main technical difference with the kind of Iwasawa decompositions used in\r

indefinite g(A). Observe that for finite dimensional matrices, there was no\r

Here the Lorentzian metric Gµν is the restriction of the invariant bilinear\r
form to the CSA. It can be identified with the metric in the space of the scale\r
factors, which is why we adopt the same notation. We have introduced in this\r
Lagrangian a “lapse function” n (not to be confused with the lapse function\r
N introduced before), which ensures that our formalism is invariant under\r
reparametrizations of the time variable. Finally, we can simply describe our\r
Lagrangian (8.44) as that of a null geodesic in the coset space G/K.\r
66

Taking the algebra AE3 as an example, this Lagrangian contains the Kas\u0002ner Lagrangian (3.10) (without dilaton) as a special truncation. More specif\u0002ically, retaining only the level zero fields (corresponding to a GL(3, R)/O(3)\r

bilinear form (8.18) reproduces (half) the Lagrangian (3.10). [This compu\u0002tation works more generally for any GL(n, R), and was already used in [28]\r
in the GL(10, R) decomposition of E10.] The level-0 sector is thus associated\r
with the Einsteinian dynamics of a spatial dreibein depending only on time.\r
Let us then consider the fields φij associated with the level-one generators\r
Eij . This leads to a truncation of our KM-invariant σ-model to the levels\r

where g denotes the covariant metric gij . As the φij ’s enter only through\r
their time derivatives, their conjugate momenta Πij are constants of the\r
motion. Eliminating the φ’s in favour of the constant momenta Π by a partial\r
Legendre transformation yields the reduced Lagrangian (for the dynamics of\r

2 − g+1g+1ΠΠ. In other words, the elimination\r
of the φ’s has generated a potential Vφ = Vφ(g) (in the gauge n = 1)\r
Vφ(g) ∝ +gijgklΠ\r
ikΠjl (8.47)\r
It is then easy to check that this potential can be identified with the lead\u0002ing (weight-2) gravitational potential in (6.14) (corresponding to the gauge\r
N˜ = 1), namely V\r

Note that the trace C\r

Consequently, when neglecting the subleading gravitational walls ∝ Fain\r
(6.14) and in four spacetime dimensions, the BKL dynamics at each given\r
spatial point x0 is equivalent to the ℓ = 0, ±1 truncation of the AE3-invariant\r
67

dynamics defined by (8.44). The fields φij (t) parametrizing the components\r
of the AE3 coset element along the ℓ = 1 generators are canonically conjugate\r
to the structure constants C\r
i\r
jk(t, x0).\r
Similarly, one would like to associate the generators (8.33) with higher\r
order spatial gradients. However, the proper physical interpretation of these\r
fields as well as of the other higher level components remains yet to be found.\r
In the case of the relation between supergravity in D = 11 and the E10 coset\r
model one could pursue the correspondence between spacetime fields and\r
coset coordinates up to the gl(10, R) level ℓ = 3 included (corresponding\r
to height 29) [28]. The correspondence worked thanks to several “miracu\u0002lous” agreements between the numerical coefficients appearing in both La\u0002grangians.\r
Varying (8.44) w.r.t. the lapse function n gives rise to the constraint that\r
the coset Lagrangian vanish. Let us define the canonical momenta\r
πµ :=\r

to be studied below, a broken future-oriented lightlike line.\r
Because the coefficients of the exponentials in (8.51) are non-negative we\r
can now apply exactly the same reasoning as in chapter 5. The crucial point\r
is that the Cartan variables β do not enter the commutation relations of the\r
Π as indicated above. Therefore, as above, the off-diagonal components να,s\r
and the momentum-like variables Πα,s get frozen asymptotically, provided\r
all spacelike walls are “behind the motion” so that they do not conflict with\r
the BKL limit. As before, we can introduce hyperbolic polar coordinates for\r
parametrizing the dynamics of the Cartan variables β\r
µ = ργµ\r

the limit ρ → ∞, the Hamiltonian (8.52) behaves as\r

Kα exp [ − 2α(β)] (8.53)\r
with constants Kα ≥ 0. This looks like a Toda Hamiltonian, except that\r
the sum extends over all roots, rather than only the simple ones, and that\r
the underlying KM algebra is indefinite, and not just finite or affine as in\r
standard Toda theory. However, the dominant potential walls in the limit\r
ρ → ∞ are given by those terms Kα exp [ − 2α(β)] for which α is a simple\r
root. Indeed, by definition, the non-simple roots α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · ·\r
give rise to potential terms ∝ [exp(−2α1(β))]n1[exp(−2α2(β))]n2\r
· · · which\r
are subdominant w.r.t. the set of potentials corresponding to the simple\r

present KM setup, all the walls enter on the same footing. There is nothing\r
left of the distinctions that entered our foregoing BKL-type studies between\r
different types of walls (symmetry walls, gravitational walls, electric walls,...).\r
The only important characteristic of a wall is its height ht α ≡ n1 + n2 + · · ·\r
for a root decomposed along simple roots as α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · ·.\r
The sum in (8.52) not only ranges over the real roots, which give rise to\r
infinitely many timelike walls, but also over null and purely imaginary roots\r
of the KM algebra giving rise to lightlike and spacelike walls, respectively. In\r
view of our discussion in section 7, the significance of the latter for the KM\r
billiard remains to be fully elucidated. Here we only remark that imaginary\r
roots are of no relevance for the Weyl group of the KM algebra, which by defi\u0002nition consists only of reflections against the timelike hyperplanes orthogonal\r
to real roots.\r
To conclude: in the limit where one goes to infinity in the Cartan di\u0002rections, the dynamics of the Cartan degrees of freedom of the coset model\r
become equivalent to a billiard motion within the Weyl chamber, subject to\r
the zero-energy constraint H(β, π) = 0. Therefore, in the cases where the\r
cosmological billiards that we discussed in the first part of this paper are\r
of KM-type, the gravitational models are asymptotically equivalent (modulo\r
the imposition of the additional momentum and Gauss constraints) to the\r
product over the spatial points of independent (1 + 0)-dimensional KM coset\r
models G/K."""

By contrast, for infinite dimensional matrices the existence of the formal\r

in the BKL limit if the KM algebra is hyperbolic. Secondly, even if J could\r
be conjugated into the CSA (as might be the case for certain non-generic el\u0002ements) there remains the possibility that the required diagonalizing matrix\r
(an infinite dimensional analog of the matrix L in (4.1)) introduces an infinite\r
number of effective collisions in the time development of the analog of (4.1),\r
because the number of effective collisions was found to increase with the rank\r

possible consistent truncations of our σ-model. By a “consistent truncation”\r
we here mean a sub-model whose solutions are solutions of the full model.\r
In order to formalize this notion, let us introduce a gradation D of root\r
space: the D-degree of a root α = n1α1 + n2α2 + · · · is defined as D(α) :=\r
n1D1 + n2D2 + · · ·, where (D1, D2, · · ·) is a given set of non-negative integers.\r
Examples are the sl(3, R)-level ℓ, the affine level m, or the height D(α) ≡\r
ht (α) = n1 + n2 + · · ·. In terms of an expansion according to increasing\r
gradation D, the full σ-model Lagrangian (8.44) has the structure (with all\r

The notation here is somewhat schematic: the lower indices on the roots\r

α1, α2, . . . are not simple roots here). Furthermore, the degree zero term\r
coincides with the free CSA kinetic term β˙ 2only if Di > 0 for all i; for other\r
gradations, the level zero sector is described by the σ-model Lagrangian for\r
the respective level-0 subalgebra (which may be non-abelian as was the case\r

for n ≥ 3, where, for instance, j3 = ˙ν\r

, and so on.\r
Note that the highest-degree variable ν\r
2 does not explicitly appear in the\r

truncated Hamiltonian H(2). This implies that the corresponding highest\u0002degree canonical momentum p2 is a constant of the motion. However, non\u0002trivial dynamics is obtained for the remaining degrees of freedom β, π; ν\r
1\r
, p1.\r
Note also that a particular set of solutions of the D-degree-2 dynamics above\r
is obtained when the constant of motion p2 happens to vanish. This particular\r
case of the D-degree-2 dynamics is simply the D-degree-1 truncation of the\r
original dynamics, obtained by setting to zero all momenta above level 2, i.e.\r
p2 = p3 = . . . = 0. The corresponding Hamiltonian is simply\r
H(1)(β, π; ν\r

2 + exp ( − 2α1(β)) p2\r

(8.65)\r
Again the highest-degree momentum, which is now p1, is a constant of the\r
motion, so that H(1) directly defines the reduced dynamics of the Cartan\r
variables β, π.\r
For D ≡ ht, the truncated dynamics (8.65) at degree D = 1 defines the\r
finite hyperbolic Toda model (8.54) involving only the simple roots. We have\r
seen in the previous subsection that this height-1 Hamiltonian universally de\u0002scribes the asymptotic dynamics of the full σ-model. [Its BKL-limit directly\r
yields the universal Weyl-chamber billiard (8.55).] On the other hand, when\r
the chosen gradation is the sl(3) level of AE3, we get the low-level trunca\u0002tions of subsection 8.2 above: the level-0 truncation (p1 = . . . = 0) yields\r
the Kasner dynamics, while the level-1 dynamics describes the leading effect\r
of the gravitational walls. A similar hierarchy of truncations appears in the\r
E10 model of [28], where the analysis included levels ℓ = 0, 1, 2, 3 w.r.t. to\r
the sl(10, R) ≡ A9 (see also [25]).\r
Let us now clarify the meaning of the infinite set of conserved charges\r

Here only the third term spreads over the full algebra g = n\r
− ⊕ h ⊕ n+,\r
while the first and second are entirely contained in the parabolic subalge\u000274

bras h ⊕ n\r
+ and n+, respectively. From this fact, it is easy to see that any\r
truncation where the Πα,s vanish for all roots strictly above some degree, i.e.\r
for D(α) > n0, implies the vanishing of the correspondingly low “negative\u0002root charges” J−α,s. As for the non-zero highest-degree momenta Πα0,s with\r
D(α0) = n0, Eq. (8.66) simply yields Πα0,s = J−α0,s. We thus recover the\r
result above concerning the constancy of the highest-degree momenta. We\r
can then move up (always in D-degree) by adding simple roots αi to α0.\r
Eq. (8.66) then implies Πα0−αi,s = J−α0+αi,s + cναiJ−α0,s, where the constant\r
c is determined by the commutations relations. Continuing in this manner\r
until one reaches the degree zero, one obtains for all the negative-degree\r
(non-vanishing) momenta expressions which are linear in the charges and\r
polynomial of ascending order in the off-diagonal fields να,s. Note, however,\r
that these relations do not suffice to eliminate non-trivial degrees of freedom\r
from the truncated Hamiltonian,i.e. to replace it by an (on-shell) equivalent\r
Hamiltonian depending on fewer variables. [The only degrees of freedom\r
that one can straightforwardly eliminate are the trivial highest-degree ones,\r
whose associated “position variables” do not enter the Hamiltonian.] One\r
might think that one would get further relations, and eventually enough re\u0002lations to eliminate the off-diagonal degrees of freedom, by considering the\r
higher-degree components of Eq. (8.66). However, it does not work this way.\r

(where c\r

is a constant vector) gives an expression for the degree-zero mo\u0002menta π\r
µ which is linear in the charges and polynomial in the να,s’s. On the\r
other hand, the positive-degree projection of Eq. (8.66) yields for the positive\u0002degree components of the charges Jα,s expressions which (for any positive\r
degree) will involve “hidden” off-diagonal fields να,s of degree D(α) > n0.\r
These new variables did not enter the truncated Hamiltonians (8.63), which\r
shows explicitly that the infinite number of conserved charges Jα,s of the\r
original σ-model do not provide sufficiently many autonomous constants of\r
the motion for the truncated Hamiltonian to guarantee its “integrability” in\r
the trivial sense of allowing one to reduce the number of degrees of freedom\r
to zero.\r
Let us also dispose of another paradox concerning the formal integrability\r
of KM-related models. Even if we consider the hyperbolic Toda model defined\r
75

by the truncation of our general σ-model to height one, i.e. Hsimple(β, π) given\r
by Eq. (8.54) with (strictly) positive constants Ki, one finds that it has formal\r
integrability features. Indeed, the model (8.54) admits a Lax pair. Setting\r

satisfy the Lax-pair evolution equation M˙ = [K, M]. One would then expect\r
to be able to write down (infinitely) many conserved quantities associated\r
to the isospectrality of the evolution of M(t). [In the finite-dimensional case\r
all the traces of the matrix M(t) are constants of the motion, see e.g. [90]\r
and references therein.] However, in the KM case this formal Lax-pair inte\u0002grability does not yield any concrete constants of the motion because there\r
is no useful analog of the matrix trace in the KM algebra. The integrability\r
properties of hyperbolic Toda theories have also been discussed in [43].\r
Let us note also in passing that there is full compatibility between our\r
general result of the asymptotic constancy of all the off-diagonal degrees\r
of freedom να,s, Πα,s and the existence of an infinite number of conserved\r
quantities Jα,s. Morally speaking the two infinite sets of asymptotic constants\r
of integration {lim να,s}, {lim Πα,s} correspond to the doubly infinite set of\r
charges {J±α,s} (in non-zero degree), and one can check the compatibility of\r
this correspondence by using the results above concerning truncated models.\r
As for the zero-level conservation law (8.67) it is also compatible with the\r
asymptotic limit because, in the gauge we use here (analogous to the β\u0002space picture of the billiard) all the components of the zero-degree momenta\r
π\r
µ\r
tend to zero asymptotically (because of the redhifts accumulated on the\r
receding walls).\r
In summary, there is thus no contradiction between the formal integra\u0002bility of our σ-model and the chaos that appears in its generic asymptotic\r
dynamics. This is mainly due to the presence of infinitely many degrees\r
of freedom, and the dynamics of the finite-dimensional truncations of the\r
σ-model of strictly positive degree.\r

In this paper, we have shown that theories involving gravity admit a remark\u0002able asymptotic description in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity in terms\r
of billiards in hyperbolic space. Depending on whether the actual billiard has\r
finite or infinite volume, the dynamical evolution of the local scale factors is\r
chaotic (oscillatory) or monotonic (Kasner-like). The billiard, and in partic\u0002ular its volume, is a fundamental characteristic of the theory, in the sense\r
that it is determined solely by the field content and the parameters in the\r
Lagrangian, and not by the initial conditions (in the generic case; i.e., there\r
may be initial conditions for which some walls are absent – and the billiard is\r
changed –, but these are exceptional). Although we have not investigated the\r
physical implications of this property for cosmological scenarios (in particu\u0002lar, string-inspired cosmologies [40, 14, 76, 98, 41]), nor its quantum analog,\r
we believe that this result is interesting in its own right because it uncovers\r
an intrinsic feature of gravitational theories. As discussed in section 8, the\r
regularity properties of some billiards appear to give a powerful handle on\r
possible hidden Kac-Moody symmetries, which remain to be exploited for\r
their full worth.\r

A Asymptotic freezing: a simple model\r
We have seen in the text that the “non-diagonal” phase-space variables (Q, P)\r
(i.e. all variables except the extended scale factors β\r
µ parametrizing the\r
diagonal-Iwasawa-part of the metric, and the dilaton), get frozen to constant\r
values in the BKL limit. We provide here a more detailed understanding\r
77

of this property by discussing a simpler model which captures the essential\r
features of the Hamiltonian (5.25).\r
Consider a system with two canonically conjugate pairs (q, p), (Q, P) and\r
time-dependent Hamiltonian\r
H(q, p, Q, P; T) = 1\r

where ρ is ρ ≡ exp(T), with T the time variable. We have simplified here the\r
Hamiltonian (5.26) by eliminating the variable λ, i.e. by replacing it by an\r
explicit function of the coordinate time T, in the approximation of a constant\r
πλ, so that λ is a linear function of T (we scaled things so that λ = T). One\r
can think of (q, p) as mimicking the scale factors, while (Q, P) mimicks the\r
off-diagonal components or the p-form variables. In (A.1), there is only one\r
potential wall for q (namely, the second term). We shall consider later the\r
case with several walls.\r
Let us start by remarking the important fact that the variable f(Q, P)\r
has zero Poisson bracket with H, therefore it is a constant of the motion.\r
To simplify the following argument, we assume that we perform a canonical\r
transformation such that P\r
new = f(Q, P). Dropping henceforth the label\r
“new”, we get P = P0 where P0 is a constant which we assume to be different\r
from zero. The basic aim of this Appendix is then to show that the (new)\r
conjugate variable Q will also tend to a constant as T → +∞.\r
In the limit of large times, the motion in q is a free motion interrupted\r
by a collision against the potential wall,\r
q = p0|T − T0| + q0 (A.2)\r
where T0 is the time of the collision, q0 the turning point, and p0 the constant\r
momentum of q far from the wall. The location of the turning point is\r
determined by energy conservation (using the fact that p(T0) vanishes before\r
changing sign):\r
P\r

0 ρ\r
k\r

e\r
−ρ0q0 = p2\r

. (A.3)\r
The time scale ∆T of the collision (during which one feels the influence of the\r
exponential potential) is roughly of the order 1/(ρ0p0): the later the collision,\r
the sharper the wall. Let us evaluate the change in Q in the collision. To\r
that end, we need to integrate Q˙ = P ρkexp(−ρq) over the collision, which\r
yields\r
∆Q = P0\r

the value at the maximum times the time scale of the collision. Using (A.3),\r
one gets\r
∆Q ≈\r

(A.5)\r
Hence, the variable Q receives a kick during the collision (which can be of\r
order one at early times), but the later the collision (i.e. the larger T0), the\r
smaller the kick.\r
Assume now that there is another wall with the same prefactor and the\r
same time dependence, say at q = d, so that q bounces between these two\r
walls,\r
Vadditional =\r

At each collision Q receives a kick of order 1/ρ0 = e\r
−T0\r
. Because the\r
speed of q remains constant (in the large T limit), the collisions are equally\r
spaced in T. Therefore, the time of the nth collision grows linearly with n:\r
roughly T\r
(n)\r
0 ∼ nd/p0 The total change in Q is then obtained by summing\r
all the individual changes, which yields\r
(∆Q)T otal ∼\r
X\r
n\r
e\r
−n d/p0\r
(A.6)\r
This sum converges. Therefore, after a while, one can neglect the further\r
change in Q, i.e., assume Q˙ = 0. The Hamiltonian describing the large time\r
limit is obtained by taking the sharp wall limit in the above H, and reads\r
therefore\r
H =\r
1\r
2\r
p\r
2 + Θ(−q) + Θ(q − d). (A.7)\r
The pair (Q, P) drops out because it is asymptotically frozen. Our analysis\r
justifies taking the sharp wall limit directly in H for this system, which is\r
the procedure we followed in the text to get the gravitational billiards.\r
Note that, had we studied a more complicated model with different pref\u0002actors for the different walls, the prefactors fA(Q, P) would no longer have\r
been exactly conserved. However, their non-conservation would only have\r
been driven by the “far-away” walls, so that their time-variation would have\r
been exponentially small."""
