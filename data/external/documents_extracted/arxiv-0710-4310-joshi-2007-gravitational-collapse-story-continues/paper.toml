Abstract\r
We define the thin fundamental categorical group P2(M, ∗) of a based\r
smooth manifold (M, ∗) as the categorical group whose objects are rank-1\r
homotopy classes of based loops on M, and whose morphisms are rank\u00022 homotopy classes of homotopies between based loops on M. Here two\r
maps are rank-n homotopic, when the rank of the differential of the homo\u0002topy between them equals n. Let C(G) be a Lie categorical group coming\r
from a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). We construct categorical\r
holonomies, defined to be smooth morphisms P2(M, ∗) → C(G), by using\r
a notion of categorical connections, being a pair (ω, m), where ω is a con\u0002nection 1-form on P, a principal G bundle over M, and m is a 2-form on\r
P with values in the Lie algebra of E, with the pair (ω, m) satisfying suit\u0002able conditions. As a further result, we are able to define Wilson spheres\r
in this context.\r

Introduction\r
Categorification is an influential idea in many areas of mathematics, and in\r
geometry it is natural to try and think about categorifying the notions of holon\u0002omy and parallel transport in terms of higher categorical generalisations of the\r
notions of loop, Lie group and connection on a principal bundle, in the spirit\r
of Baez and Schreiber [B, BS]. In this article we construct a framework for\r
2-dimensional, or surface, holonomy along such lines. The based loops on a\r
manifold M are replaced by what we call the (strict) thin fundamental cate\u0002gorical group of M, P2(M, ∗), a monoidal category whose objects are rank-1\r
homotopy classes of based loops on M and whose morphisms are rank-2 ho\u0002motopy classes of homotopies between based loops (or 1-parameter families of\r
loops). Here, rank-1 homotopy, at the level of loops, means that the loops are\r
homotopic in such a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy be\u0002tween them is less than or equal to 1, i.e. the homotopies between loops do not\r
sweep out area. Similarly, at the level of morphisms, two homotopies between\r
based loops are rank-2 homotopic, if they themselves are homotopic in such\r
a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy between them is less\r
than or equal to 2, i.e. the homotopy between homotopies does not sweep out\r
volume. For precise definitions, we refer to subsections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The Lie\r
group is replaced by a categorical Lie group, C(G), naturally obtained from a\r
crossed module of Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). The connection on a princi\u0002pal G-bundle P over M is replaced by what we call a categorical connection,\r
consisting of a connection 1-form on P with values in g, the Lie algebra of G,\r
together with a 2-form on P with values in e, the Lie algebra of E, satisfying\r
some conditions including the well-known “vanishing of the fake curvature”.\r
Locally these conditions correspond to Baez and Schreiber’s [BS] local formu\u0002lation for a 2-connection. The Maurer-Cartan structure equation and Bianchi\r
identity for the curvature of an ordinary connection are shown to have natural\r
analogues for the curvature 3-form of the categorical connection. Also a variant\r
of the Ambrose-Singer theorem (which plays a crucial role in our construction\r
of categorical holonomy) generalises to a higher-order version.\r
A categorical holonomy is defined to be a (strict monoidal) smooth functor\r
from P2(M, ∗) to C(G). The main result that we prove (Thm. 39) is how a\r
categorical connection gives rise to a categorical holonomy. The underlying\r
geometrical idea is to lift the 1-parameter family of loops into P, horizontally in\r
one direction, namely the direction along the loops, and to use this lift to pull\r
back the forms of the categorical connection, which are then integrated suitably.\r
Note that the appearance of a principal G-bundle P with a connection is\r
natural in the context of categorical holonomies. This is because, at the level of\r
the set of objects of P2(M, ∗), i.e. π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗), the thin homotopy classes of based\r
loops on M, any smooth functor P2(M, ∗) → G gives rise to a smooth group\r
morphism π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G, and therefore it defines a principal G-bundle over M\r
3

with a connection [CP, MP].\r
The whole construction is carried out using the language and methods of dif\u0002ferential geometry and principal bundles, thereby avoiding working with infinite\u0002dimensional path spaces, which was an approach taken in [BS]. The construction\r
is coordinate-free from the outset, since we use forms defined on P. We remark\r
that the construction of P2(M, ∗) is of interest in its own right in defining a\r
strict thin fundamental categorical group of a manifold (previously only a weak\r
version was known). This part of our construction is very similar to that of\r
[BHKP, HKK].\r
We study the relation between our construction and non-abelian gerbes, as in\r
[BrMe], and 2-bundles, as in [BS], in 2.4.6. Note that each 2-bundle with struc\u0002ture 2-group coming from a crossed module of the form (Ad: G → Aut(G), ⊲),\r
where ⊲ denotes the obvious left action of Aut(G) in G, is naturally a non-abelian\r
gerbe. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Our construction cor\u0002responds to a particular case of G-2-bundles, for which the E-valued transition\r
functions are trivial, and therefore the G-valued transition functions satisfy the\r
usual cocycle condition for a principal G-bundle. Although G-2-bundles are\r
a natural way to approach two-dimensional holonomy, we emphasise that our\r
main goal is the definition of categorical group maps P2(M, ∗) → C(G). This is\r
a very strong condition, and we argue that it should force the G-2-bundle with\r
connection to be of the special form considered here - see 2.4.6 where this point\r
is elaborated.\r
At the end of this article we define the notion of Wilson sphere, which means\r
that a categorical holonomy, taking values in the kernel of ∂ : E → G, can be\r
associated to embedded spheres in a manifold, up to acting by an element of\r
the group G.\r
1 Preliminaries\r
1.1 Resum´e of results and notation from the theory of\r
principal fibre bundles\r
1.1.1 Connections on principal fibre bundles\r
For full details on connections on principal fibre bundles see [KN, P].\r
Let M be a paracompact smooth manifold. Let G be a Lie group with Lie\r
algebra g. Consider a principal G-bundle P over M, with canonical projection\r
π: P → M. For each x ∈ M, let Px = π\r
−1\r
(x) be the fibre at x. Let also X(P)\r
denote the Lie algebra of smooth vector fields on P. Recall that there exists a Lie\r
algebra morphism A ∈ g 7→ A# ∈ X(P), such that A#\r
u =\r
d\r
dtu exp(tA)t=0, ∀u ∈\r
P, ∀A ∈ g. Here if X ∈ X(P) is a vector field then Xu ∈ TuP (the tangent space\r
of P at u ∈ P) denotes the value of X at the point u.\r
Denote the right action of G on P as g ∈ G 7→ Rg ∈ diff(P), where diff(P)\r
denotes the diffeomorphism group of P. Recall the following very useful formula:\r
(Rg)\r
∗\r
(A\r
#) = \r
g\r
−1Ag\u0001#\r
,\r
4

where g ∈ G and A ∈ g. Given an element u ∈ P, recall that a vector Xu ∈ TuP\r
is said to be vertical if π∗(Xu) = 0. Let T\r
V\r
u P denote the subspace of vertical\r
vectors in TuP. Notice that any Xu ∈ T\r
V\r
u P is of the form A#u\r
for some A ∈ g,\r
and this correspondence is one-to-one.\r
Let ω ∈ A1(P, g) be a connection on P. In other words ω is a smooth 1-form\r
on P with values in g such that:\r
1. R∗\r
g\r
(ω) = g\r
−1ωg, ∀g ∈ G,\r
2. ω(A#) = A, ∀A ∈ g.\r
Given an element u ∈ P, let T\r
H\r
u P = {Xu ∈ TuP : ω(Xu) = 0}, the horizontal\r
subspace at u ∈ P. Then T\r
H\r
u\r
is a complementary subspace of T\r
V\r
u P in TuP for\r
each u ∈ P. Moreover, the following identity holds for each g ∈ G and u ∈ P:\r
\r
T\r
H\r
u P\r
\u0001\r
g = T\r
H\r
ugP.\r
The natural projection maps X ∈ T P 7→ XH and X ∈ T P 7→ XV are\r
smooth. Here T P denotes the tangent bundle of P. There exists also a unique\r
map X ∈ X(M) 7→ Xe ∈ X(P), called the horizontal lift of X ∈ X(M), such\r
that Xeu ∈ T\r
H\r
u P, ∀u ∈ P and π∗(Xe) = X, for any X ∈ X(M), the Lie algebra\r
of smooth vector fields on M. Note that this horizontal lift gives rise to linear\r
maps TxM → TuP, if π(u) = x, where x ∈ M and u ∈ P. The horizontal lift of\r
a vector field X ∈ X(M) is always G-invariant. In other words:\r
Xg e = X, e ∀g ∈ G.\r
1.1.2 Curvature\r
Let P be a principal G-bundle over M. Let ω ∈ A1(P, g) be a connection 1-form\r
on P. Given an n-form a on P, the exterior covariant derivative of a is given by\r
Da = da ◦ (H × H . . . × H | {z }\r
(n+1)-times\r
).\r
Let Ω ∈ A2(P, g) be the curvature 2-form of the connection ω. It can be\r
defined as the exterior covariant derivative Dω of the connection 1-form ω, in\r
other words:\r
Ω(X, Y ) = dω(XH, Y H),\r
where X, Y ∈ X(P). The curvature 2-form Ω is G-equivariant, which means:\r
R\r
∗\r
g\r
(Ω) = g\r
−1Ωg, ∀g ∈ G.\r
Recall also Cartan’s structure equation:\r
dω(X, Y ) + [ω(X), ω(Y )] = Ω(X, Y ), (1)\r
5

valid for any vector fields X, Y ∈ X(P). The Bianchi identity can be stated by\r
saying that the exterior covariant derivative DΩ of the curvature form is zero,\r
in other words:\r
DΩ = dΩ ◦ (H × H × H) = 0. (2)\r
The Bianchi identity can also be written as:\r
dΩ(X, Y, Z) + [ω(X), Ω(Y, Z)] + [ω(Y ), Ω(Z, X)] + [ω(Z), Ω(X, Y )] = 0,\r
for any smooth vector fields X, Y, Z ∈ X(P).\r
1.1.3 Parallel transport\r
Let P be a principal G-bundle over the manifold M. Let ω ∈ A1(P, g) be a\r
connection on P. Recall that ω determines a parallel transport along smooth\r
curves. Specifically, given x ∈ M and a smooth curve γ : [0, 1] → M, with\r
γ(0) = x, then there exists a smooth map:\r
(t, u) ∈ [0, 1] × Px 7→ Hω(γ, t, u) ∈ P,\r
uniquely defined by the conditions:\r
1. d\r
dtHω(γ, t, u) = \u0012^ddtγ(t)\r
\u0013\r
Hω(γ,t,u)\r
; ∀t ∈ [0, 1], ∀u ∈ Px,\r
2. Hω(γ, 0, u) = u; ∀u ∈ Px.\r
In particular this implies that Hω(γ, t), given by u 7→ Hω(γ, t, u), maps Px\r
bijectively into Pγ(t), for any t ∈ [0, 1]. Recall that the parallel transport is\r
G-equivariant, in other words:\r
Hω(γ, t, ug) = Hω(γ, t, u)g, ∀g ∈ G, ∀u ∈ Px.\r
1.1.4 The dependence of the parallel transport on a smooth family\r
of curves - the Ambrose-Singer theorem\r
Let M be a smooth manifold. Let Dn .= [0, 1]n be the n-cube, where n ∈ N. A\r
map f : Dn → M is said to be smooth if its partial derivatives of any order exist\r
and are continuous as maps Dn → M. Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra\r
g. Consider a smooth principal G-bundle π: P → M with a connection 1-form\r
ω ∈ A1(P, g).\r
Now let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ γs be a smooth 1-parameter family of smooth curves\r
[0, 1] → M. Here smooth means that the map Γ: (t, s) ∈ [0, 1]27→ γs(t) ∈ M\r
is smooth. Define the initial point map q : [0, 1] → M by q(s) = γs(0) for each\r
s ∈ [0, 1]. Choose u ∈ Pq(0) and set us = Hω(q, s, u) ∈ Pq(s), where s ∈ [0, 1].\r
Our purpose is to analyse the s-dependence of Hω(γs, t, us), where s, t ∈ [0, 1],\r
by calculating:\r
∂\r
∂sHω(γs, t, us).\r
6

This analysis is of course classical.\r
For convenience of notation, define\r
f(s, t) = Hω(γs, t, us); s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Let the coordinate vector fields of [0, 1]2 be ∂\r
∂t and ∂∂s . We have:\r
∂\r
∂tω\r
\u0012\r
∂\r

.\r
Note that the second equation follows from the well-known formula\r
dφ(X, Y ) = Xφ(Y ) − Y φ(X) − φ([X, Y ]), (3)\r
valid for any 2-form φ on a manifold M and any X, Y ∈ X(M). The last\r
equation follows from the fact that ∂\r
∂tf(s, t) is horizontal, by definition of parallel\r
transport.\r
Therefore by Cartan’s structure equation (1) and the fact that ∂\r
∂tf(s, t) is\r
horizontal it follows that:\r
∂\r
∂tω\r
\u0012\r

= Ω \u0012\r

∂\r

Since Ω(X, Y ) = 0 if either of the vectors X or Y is vertical we can conclude:\r

Note that, by definition of parallel transport, we have\r

\u0013H\r
=\r
∂\r
∂tf(s, t) = \r

Given that \r

\u0001H\r
is horizontal and the fact that:\r

Going back to equation (4), we have that, for each s ∈ [0, 1], ω\r
\r
∂\r
∂s f(s, 0)\u0001\r
=\r
0, since f(s, 0) = us = Hω(q, s, u), hence ∂\r
∂s f(s, 0) is horizontal for each s ∈\r
[0, 1]. We thus arrive at the following well known result:\r

Lemma 1 Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra g. Let P be a smooth principal\r
G-bundle over the manifold M. Let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ γs be a smooth 1-parameter\r
family of curves [0, 1] → M. Here smooth means that the map (s, t) ∈ [0, 1]27→\r
γs(t) ∈ M is smooth. Consider a connection ω ∈ A1(P, g). Let q : [0, 1] → M\r
be the curve such that q(s) = γs(0), ∀s ∈ [0, 1]. Choose u ∈ Pq(0), and let us =\r
Hω(q, s, u) ∈ Pq(s), where s ∈ [0, 1]. The following holds for each s, t′ ∈ [0, 1]:\r

Consider the case when all curves γs : [0, 1] → M, where s ∈ [0, 1], are closed,\r
though possibly with varying initial points. (This flexibility will be important\r
to define Wilson spheres in 2.5.3). Then we can define a family of holonomies\r
gγs ∈ G, where s ∈ [0, 1], by:\r
usgγs = Hω(γs, 1, us), ∀s ∈ [0, 1].\r
We will use the preceding lemma to obtain a differential equation satisfied by\r

1.2 Crossed modules\r
All Lie groups and Lie algebras are taken to be finite-dimensional.\r
Definition 3 (Lie crossed module) A crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) is\r
given by a group morphism ∂ : E → G together with a left action ⊲ of G on E\r
by automorphisms, such that:\r
1. ∂(X ⊲ e) = X∂(e)X−1; ∀X ∈ G, ∀e ∈ E,\r
2. ∂(e) ⊲ f = efe−1; ∀e, f ∈ E.\r
If both G and E are Lie groups, ∂ : E → G is a smooth morphism, and the left\r
action of G on E is smooth then G will be called a Lie crossed module.\r
A morphism G → G′ between the crossed modules G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) and\r
G\r
′ = (∂′\r
: E′ → G′, ⊲′) is given by a pair of maps φ: G → G′ and ψ: E → E′\r
making the diagram:\r
E\r
∂\r
−−−−→ G\r
ψ\r
\r
\r
y\r
\r
\r
yφ\r
E′ ∂\r
′\r
−−−−→ G′\r
commutative. In addition we must have ψ(X ⊲ e) = φ(X) ⊲\r
′ ψ(e) for each e ∈ E\r
and each X ∈ G.\r
Given a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲), then the induced Lie algebra\r
map ∂ : e → g, together with the derived action of g on e (also denoted by ⊲)\r
is a differential crossed module, in the sense of the following definition - see\r
[BS, B, BC].\r
Definition 4 (Differential crossed module) A differential crossed module,\r
say G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲), is given by a Lie algebra morphism ∂ : e → g together\r
with a left action of g on the underlying vector space of e, such that:\r
1. For any X ∈ g the map e ∈ e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is a derivation of e, in other\r
words\r
X ⊲ [e, f] = [X ⊲ e, f] + [e, X ⊲ f]; ∀X ∈ g, ∀e, f ∈ e.\r
2. The map g → Der(e) from g into the derivation algebra of e induced by\r
the action of g on e is a Lie algebra morphism. In other words:\r
[X, Y ] ⊲ e = X ⊲ (Y ⊲ e) − Y ⊲ (X ⊲ e); ∀X, Y ∈ g, ∀e ∈ e.\r
3. ∂(X ⊲ e) = [X, ∂(e)]; ∀X ∈ g, ∀e ∈ e.\r
4. ∂(e) ⊲ f = [e, f]; ∀e, f ∈ e.\r
9

Note that the map (X, e) ∈ g × e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is necessarily bilinear.\r
Therefore, given a differential crossed module, G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) there exists\r
a unique crossed module of simply connected Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
whose differential form is G, up to isomorphism. The proof of this result is\r
standard Lie theory, together with the lift of the Lie algebra action to a Lie\r
group action, which can be found in [K], Thm 1.102.\r
Example 5 Let G be a Lie group with a left action ⊲ on an abelian group V by\r
automorphisms, for example take V to be any representation of G on a vector\r
space. If we put ∂ = 1G then (∂ : V → G, ⊲) is a Lie crossed module. Its\r
differential form is given by the derived action of g on V and the zero map\r
V → g.\r
Example 6 Let G be any Lie group. Let Ad denote the adjoint action of G on\r
G. Then (id: G → G, Ad) is a Lie crossed module.\r
Example 7 Let G and E be Lie groups, and let ∂ : E → G be a surjective map\r
such that ker(∂) is central in E. Define a left action of G on E as g ⊲e = g0eg−1\r
0\r
,\r
where g0 ∈ E is such that ∂(g0) = g ∈ G, and e ∈ E. Then G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
is a Lie crossed module.\r
Example 8 In the previous example, we can take the universal covering map\r
SU(2) → SO(3), whose kernel is {±1}. The differential form of this crossed\r
module is given by the adjoint action of su(2) on su(2) and the identity map.\r
Example 9 More generally, take the universal cover ∂ : E → G of the Lie\r
group G. Then the construction in example 7 can be applied since the kernel of\r
∂ is necessarily central in E.\r
Example 10 Let H be the group of upper triangular matrices in R which only\r
have 1’s in the main diagonal. Define a Lie group map ∂ : H → R\r
2 as\r
∂\r
\r
\r
1 a b\r
0 1 c\r
0 0 1\r
\r
 = (a, c),\r
where a, b, c ∈ R. Then the kernel of ∂ : H → R\r
2\r
is central in H, and therefore\r
the construction in example 7 can be applied.\r
Example 11 Let E be any Lie group. Let Aut(E) be the group of automor\u0002phisms of E. Then Aut(E) is a Lie group, in fact it is a Lie subgroup of GL(e) if\r
E is simply connected. Consider the map Ad: E → Aut(E) that sends e ∈ E to\r
the automorphism Ad(e): E → E. The group Aut(E) acts on E as φ ⊲ e = φ(e)\r
where φ ∈ Aut(E) and e ∈ E. Then (Ad: E → Aut(E), ⊲) is a Lie crossed\r
module.\r
The previous construction yields several examples of Lie crossed modules. For\r
instance, example 8 is obtained this way since Aut(SU(2)) = SO(3). To get new\r
examples, however, we need to consider non-semisimple Lie groups.\r
10

Example 12 In example 11, take E = H, the group of upper triangular 3 × 3\r
matrices in R, which only have 1’s in the main diagonal. Then the crossed\r
module (Ad: H → Aut(H), ⊲) is highly non-trivial. In fact, Ad(E) is isomorphic\r
to R\r
2\r
, whereas the cokernel Out(E) of Ad is isomorphic to GL(2, R), see [KH].\r
The kernel of Ad is a central subgroup of H isomorphic to R; see example 10.\r
1.2.1 Crossed modules and categorical groups\r
Definition 13 (Categorical groups and Lie categorical groups) A cate\u0002gorical group C is a groupoid provided with a strict monoidal structure C×C ⊗−→ C,\r
as well as a “group inversion” functor −1: C → C such that both the set of ob\u0002jects C0 of C and the set of morphisms C1 of C are groups under the tensor\r
product, and both the source and target maps σ, τ : C1 → C0 are group mor\u0002phisms. A Lie categorical group is defined analogously by replacing groups by\r
Lie groups and group morphisms by Lie group morphisms.\r
See [BM, BL] for more details.\r
Definition 14 (Morphism of categorical groups) A morphism of categor\u0002ical groups is given by a strict monoidal functor; see [ML].\r
It is well-known that the category of crossed modules and the category of\r
categorical groups are equivalent; see for example [BL, BM, BHS]. Let us ex\u0002plain how to define a categorical group C(G) from a crossed module G. This\r
construction is an old one.\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a crossed module. The set of objects C0 of C(G)\r
is given by all elements of G. The set of morphisms C1 of C(G) is given by the\r
set of all pairs (X, e) where X ∈ G and e ∈ E. The source and the target of\r
(X, e) ∈ C1 are given by σ(X, e) = X and τ(X, e) = ∂(e)\r
−1X, respectively.\r
In other words, a morphism in C(G) “looks like” X\r
(X,e)\r
−−−→ ∂(e)\r
−1X, which we\r
will sometimes abbreviate as X\r
e−→ ∂(e)\r
−1X. Given X ∈ G and e, f ∈ E the\r
composition\r
X\r
e−→ ∂(e)\r
−1X\r
f\r
−→ ∂(f)\r
−1\r
∂(e)\r
−1X\r
is\r
X\r
ef\r
−→ ∂(ef)\r
−1X.\r
The tensor product has the form:\r
∂(e)\r
−1X\r
x\r
\r
e\r
X\r
⊗\r
∂(f)\r
−1Y\r
x\r
\r
f\r
Y\r
=\r
∂(e)\r
−1X∂(f)−1Y\r
x\r
\r
(X⊲f)e\r
XY\r
, (8)\r
where X, Y ∈ G and e, f ∈ E. Therefore, the set of morphisms of C(G) is a\r
group under the tensor product. This group is isomorphic to the semidirect\r
product G ⋉ E of G and E.\r
11

From the definition of a crossed module, it is easy to see that we have indeed\r
defined a strict monoidal category which, furthermore, is a categorical group.\r
We will recall in 1.3.4 how to define a crossed module from a categorical\r
group.\r
1.3 The thin fundamental categorical group of a manifold\r
Let M be a smooth manifold.\r
1.3.1 1-Tracks\r
Definition 15 (1-path) A 1-path is given by a smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M\r
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 such that γ is constant in [0, ǫ] ∪ [1 − ǫ, 1]; in\r
the terminology of [CP], this can be abbreviated by saying that each end point of\r
γ has a sitting instant. Given a 1-path γ, define the source and target of γ as\r
σ(γ) = γ(0) and τ(γ) = γ(1), respectively.\r
Given two 1-paths γ and φ with τ(γ) = σ(φ), their concatenation γφ is\r
defined in the usual way:\r
(γφ)(t) = (\r
γ(2t), if t ∈ [0, 1/2]\r
φ(2t − 1), if t ∈ [1/2, 1]\r
Note that the concatenation of two 1-paths is also a 1-path. The fact that any\r
1-path has sitting instants at its end points needs to be used to prove this.\r
Definition 16 (2-paths) A 2-path Γ is given by a smooth map Γ: [0, 1]2 → M\r
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 for which:\r
1. Γ(t, s) = Γ(0, 0) if 0 ≤ t ≤ ǫ and s ∈ [0, 1],\r
2. Γ(t, s) = Γ(1, 0) if 1 − ǫ ≤ t ≤ 1 and s ∈ [0, 1],\r
3. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 0) if 0 ≤ s ≤ ǫ and t ∈ [0, 1],\r
4. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 1) if 1 − ǫ ≤ s ≤ 1 and t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Given a 2-path Γ, define the following 1-paths:\r
∂l(Γ)(s) = Γ(0, s), s ∈ [0, 1], ∂r(Γ)(s) = Γ(1, s), s ∈ [0, 1],\r
∂d(Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 0), t ∈ [0, 1], ∂u(Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 1), t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Note that the paths ∂l(Γ) and ∂r(Γ) are necessarily constant, thus each of them\r
can be identified with a point of M. In addition, given a 2-path Γ then the\r
1-paths ∂u(Γ) and ∂d(Γ) have the same initial and end points. If x is a point of\r
M the constant 1- and 2-paths with value x are both denoted by x.\r
If Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths such that ∂r(Γ) = ∂l(Γ′) their horizontal concatena\u0002tion Γ ◦h Γ\r
′\r
is defined in the obvious way, in other words:\r
12

Γ ◦h Γ\r
′\r
\u0001\r
(t, s) = (\r
Γ(2t, s), if t ∈ [0, 1/2] and s ∈ [0, 1]\r
Γ\r
′\r
(2t − 1, s), if t ∈ [1/2, 1] and s ∈ [0, 1]\r
Similarly, if ∂u(Γ) = ∂d(Γ′) we can define a vertical concatenation Γ ◦v Γ\r
′ as:\r
\r
Γ ◦v Γ\r
′\r
\u0001\r
(t, s) = (\r
Γ(t, 2s), if s ∈ [0, 1/2] and t ∈ [0, 1]\r
Γ\r
′\r
(t, 2s − 1), if s ∈ [1/2, 1] and t ∈ [0, 1]\r
We will also represent the 2-paths Γ of M in the following suggestive way:\r
Γ =\r
∂u(Γ)\r
x\r
\r
\r
Γ\r
∂d(Γ)\r
In this notation, the vertical concatenation of two 2-paths Γ and Γ\r
′ with ∂d(Γ′\r
) =\r
∂u(Γ) can be represented as:\r
Γ ◦v Γ\r
′ =\r
∂u(Γ ◦v Γ\r
′\r
)\r
x\r
\r
\r
Γ◦v Γ\r
′\r
∂d(Γ ◦v Γ\r
′\r
)\r
=\r
∂u(Γ′)\r
x\r
\r
\r
Γ\r
′\r
∂d(Γ′) = ∂u(Γ)\r
x\r
\r
\r
Γ\r
∂d(Γ)\r
Definition 17 Two 1-paths φ and γ are said to be rank-1 homotopic (and we\r
write φ ∼=1 γ) if there exists a 2-path Γ such that:\r
1. ∂u(Γ) = γ and ∂d(Γ) = φ.\r
2. Rank(DvΓ) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ [0, 1]2.\r
Here D denotes derivative.\r
In particular, if γ and φ are rank-1 homotopic, then they have the same ini\u0002tial and end-points. Note also that rank-1 homotopy is an equivalence rela\u0002tion. Given a 1-path γ, the equivalence class to which it belongs is denoted\r
by [γ]. Rank-1 homotopy is one of a number of notions of “thin” equivalence\r
between paths or loops, and was introduced in [CP], following a suggestion by\r
A. Machado.\r
We denote the set of 1-paths of M by S1(M). The quotient of S1(M) by the\r
relation of thin homotopy is denoted by S1(M). We call the elements of S1(M)\r
1-tracks. The concatenation of 1-tracks together with the source and target\r
maps σ, τ : S1(M) → M, defines a groupoid S1(M) whose set of morphisms is\r
S1(M) and whose set of objects is M.\r
13

Definition 18 Let ∗ ∈ M be a base point. The group π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) is defined as\r
being the set of 1-tracks [γ] ∈ S1(M) starting and ending at ∗, with the group\r
operation being the concatenation of paths.\r
It is easy to see directly that π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗), a thin analogue of π1(M), is indeed a\r
group. See [CP, MP] for details.\r
1.3.2 2-Tracks\r
Definition 19 Two 2-paths Γ and Γ\r
′ are said to be rank-2 homotopic (and we\r
write Γ ∼=2 Γ\r
′\r
) if there exists a smooth map J : [0, 1]2 × [0, 1] → M such that:\r
1. J(t, s, 0) = Γ(t, s), J(t, s, 1) = Γ′(t, s) for s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
2. J is constant over {0} × [0, 1]2 and {1} × [0, 1]2.\r
3. Over [0, 1]×{0}×[0, 1] the map J : [0, 1]2×[0, 1] → M restricts to a rank-1\r
homotopy ∂d(Γ) → ∂d(Γ′).\r
4. J restricts to a rank-1 homotopy ∂u(Γ) → ∂u(Γ′) over [0, 1] × {1} × [0, 1].\r
5. There exists an ǫ > 0 such that J(t, s, x) = J(t, s, 0) if x ≤ ǫ and s, t ∈\r
[0, 1], and analogously for all the other faces of [0, 1]3. We will denote this\r
condition as saying that J has a product structure close to the boundary\r
of [0, 1]3.\r
6. Rank(DvJ) ≤ 2 for any v ∈ [0, 1]3.\r
Note that rank-2 homotopy is an equivalence relation. To prove transitivity\r
we need to use the penultimate condition of the previous definition. We denote\r
by S2(M) the set of all 2-paths of M. The quotient of S2(M) by the relation of\r
rank-2 homotopy is denoted by S2(M). We call the elements of S2(M) 2-tracks.\r
If Γ ∈ S2(M), we denote the equivalence class in S2(M) to which Γ belongs by\r
[Γ].\r
1.3.3 Horizontal and vertical compositions of 2-tracks\r
Note that the horizontal composition of 2-paths descends immediately to a\r
horizontal composition in S2(M). Suppose that Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths with\r
∂u(Γ) ∼=1 ∂d(Γ′\r
). Choose a rank-1 homotopy J connecting ∂u(Γ) and ∂d(Γ′).\r
Then [Γ] ◦v [Γ′] is defined as [(Γ ◦v J) ◦v Γ\r
′\r
]. The fact that this composition is\r
well defined in S2(M) follows immediately from lemma 52 in the appendix.\r
Therefore both the vertical and horizontal compositions of 2-paths descend\r
to S2(M). These compositions are obviously associative, and admit units and\r
inverses. Since the interchange law is trivially verified the following theorem\r
holds:\r
14

Theorem 20 Let M be a smooth manifold. The horizontal and vertical com\u0002positions in S2(M) together with the boundary maps ∂u, ∂d, ∂l\r
, ∂r : S2(M) →\r
S1(M) define a 2-groupoid S2(M), whose set of objects is given by all points of\r
M, the set of 1-morphisms by the set S1(M) of 1-tracks on M, and given two\r
1-tracks [γ] and [γ\r
′\r
], the set of 2-morphisms [γ] → [γ\r
′\r
] is given by all 2-tracks\r
[Γ] with ∂d([Γ]) = [γ] and ∂u([Γ]) = [γ\r
′\r
].\r
The definition of a 2-groupoid can be found in [HKK]. This construction should\r
be compared with [HKK, BHKP], where the thin strict 2-groupoid of a Hausdorff\r
space was defined, using a different notion of thin equivalence (factoring through\r
a graph) - see also [BH] for the construction of the fundamental double groupoid\r
of a triple of spaces. For analogous non-strict constructions see [M, BS, MP].\r
1.3.4 Definition of the thin fundamental categorical group of a smooth\r
manifold\r
Since S2(M) is a 2-category, given a base point ∗ of M (in other words an\r
object of S2(M)) we can define a monoidal category P2(M, ∗). The objects of\r
P2(M, ∗) are given by all 1-tracks of M starting and ending at ∗, and therefore\r
by all elements of π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗). On the other hand, the set P2(M, ∗) of morphisms\r
of P2(M, ∗) is given by the set of all 2-tracks [Γ] ∈ S2(M) such that ∂l([Γ]) =\r
∂r([Γ]) = ∗. Therefore, given [γ], [γ\r
′\r
] ∈ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗), the set of morphisms [γ] →\r
[γ\r
′\r
] is given by all 2-tracks [Γ] connecting [γ] and [γ\r
′\r
], in other words with\r
∂d([Γ]) = [γ] and ∂u([Γ]) = [γ\r
′\r
]. The composition in P2(M, ∗) is given by the\r
vertical composition in S2(M). On the other hand the horizontal composition\r
of 2-tracks will give the tensor product in P2(M, ∗).\r
Given that S2(M) is a 2-groupoid, the monoidal category P2(M, ∗) is a\r
categorical group. We therefore call P2(M, ∗) the thin fundamental categorical\r
group of M.\r
1.3.5 The thin fundamental crossed module of a smooth manifold\r
Since P2(M, ∗) is a categorical group, it defines a crossed module Π2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗),\r
which we call the thin fundamental crossed module of M. Let us explain how\r
to construct Π2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) directly. Define a group π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) as being given by\r
π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) = {[Γ] ∈ P2(M, ∗): ∂d([Γ]) = [∗]}\r
with the product law being the horizontal composition. Note that the map\r
∂\r
.= ∂u : π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) → π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) is therefore a group morphism. In addition\r
π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) acts on π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) on the left as follows:\r
[γ] ⊲ [Γ] = id[γ] ◦h [Γ] ◦h id[γ−1],\r
where [Γ] ∈ π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) and [γ] ∈ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗). Here if [γ] is a 1-track then id[γ]\r
denotes the 2-track such that id[γ](s, t) = γ(t), where s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
The following theorem follows from the well-known equivalence between the\r
category of categorical groups and the category of crossed modules which was\r
15

referred to in 1.2.1; see [BM, BL, BMo, P]. For a graphical proof see [BHS, 6.2].\r
Theorem 21 The boundary map ∂ : π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) → π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗), together with the\r
left action of π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) on π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗), defines a crossed module, which we denote\r
by Π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗).\r
In 1.2.1 we showed how to construct a categorical group from any crossed\r
module. The way we defined Π2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) from the categorical group P2(M, ∗)\r
shows how to go in the reverse direction.\r
1.3.6 Two exact sequences\r
This subsection is not necessary to understand the rest of the article.\r
Definition 22 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let ∗ ∈ M. The group π\r
2\r
2\r
(M, ∗)\r
is given by all 2-paths Γ ∈ S2(M) such that Γ(∂([0, 1]2)) = {∗}, up to the equiva\u0002lence relation given by Γ ∼= Γ\r
′\r
if there exists a rank-2 homotopy J : [0, 1]2 × [0, 1] → M,\r
connecting Γ and Γ\r
′\r
, such that, in addition, J\r
\r
(∂([0, 1]2) × I\r
\u0001\r
= {∗}. The group\r
law is taken to be the horizontal composition.\r
For more details see [MP].\r
Theorem 23 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. The crossed\r
module Π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) can be embedded into the exact sequence:\r
{0} → π\r
2\r
2\r
(M, ∗)\r

∂\r
−→ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗)\r
p\r
−→ π1(M, ∗) → {1}.\r
Proof. The only non-trivial part is the proof that the natural map i: π\r
2\r
2\r
(M, ∗) →\r
π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) is injective. This follows from Lemma 52.\r
Definition 24 The thin k-invariant of M is defined as being the cohomol\u0002ogy class kt(M, ∗) ∈ H3\r
\r
π1(M, ∗), π2\r
2\r
(M, ∗)\r
\u0001\r
determined by the exact sequence\r
above. See [EML, Br] for the construction of these group cohomology classes.\r
We can define a 2-category Q2(M), with objects given by the points of M and\r
morphisms given by the arrows of the groupoid S1(M). The set of 2-morphisms\r
Q2(M) of Q2(M) is given by the set of 2-paths of M up to homotopy. Here\r
the notion of homotopic 2-paths is defined in the same way as the notion of\r
rank-2 homotopic 2-paths (Definition 19), but omitting the final condition on\r
the rank of the derivative of the map defining the homotopy; see the remarks\r
after definition 36. If Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths, we write Γ ∼=∞ Γ\r
′\r
to denote that\r
they are homotopic. Applying the construction that defined the crossed module\r
Π\r
2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) to Q2(M, ∗) yields a crossed module\r

2 Two-dimensional holonomies\r
2.1 Categorical connections\r
Definition 26 Let G be a Lie group. Let M be a smooth manifold. Let P → M\r
be a smooth principal bundle with structure group G. Denote the right action of\r
G on P as g ∈ G 7→ Rg ∈ diff(M). Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed\r
module, where ⊲ is a Lie group left action of G on E by automorphisms. Let also\r
G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed module. A G-categorical\r
connection on P is a pair (ω, m), where ω is a connection 1-form on P, i.e.\r
ω ∈ A1(P, g) is a 1-form on P with values in g such that:\r
1. R∗\r
g\r
(ω) = g\r
−1ωg, ∀g ∈ G,\r
2. ω(A#) = A, ∀A ∈ g;\r
and m ∈ A2(P, e) is a 2-form on P with values in e, the Lie algebra of E, such\r
that:\r
1. The 2-form m is G-equivariant. In other words we have R∗\r
g\r
(m) = g\r
−1 ⊲ m\r
for each g ∈ G.\r
2. The 2-form m is horizontal, in other words:\r
m(X, Y ) = m(X\r
H, Y H), for each X, Y ∈ X(P).\r
In particular m(Xu, Yu) = 0 if either of the vectors Xu, Yu ∈ TuP is\r
vertical, where u ∈ P. Here the map X ∈ X(P) 7→ XH ∈ X(P) denotes\r
the horizontal projection of vector fields on P with respect to the connection\r
1-form ω.\r
17

Finally we require that\r
∂(m) = Ω (9)\r
where Ω ∈ A2(P, g) is the curvature 2-form of ω.\r
This last condition is of course equivalent to the vanishing of the fake curvature\r
of [BS, BrMe]; see 2.2.4.\r
Example 27 Let P be any principal G-bundle with a connection 1-form ω.\r
Let Ω be the curvature 2-form of ω. If G = (id: G → G, ⊲), where ⊲ is the\r
adjoint action of G on G, then (ω, Ω) is a G-categorical connection on P. More\r
generally we can take G to be given by the universal covering map E → G of G;\r
see example 9.\r
2.2 The 2-curvature 3-form of a G-categorical connection\r
Recall the definition of the curvature 2-form Ω of a connection 1-form ω as the\r
covariant exterior derivative of the 1-form ω.\r
Definition 28 (2-Curvature) Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed mod\u0002ule, and let P → M be a smooth principal G-bundle. The 2-curvature 3-form\r
of a G-categorical connection (ω, m) on P is defined as\r
M = dm ◦ (H × H × H).\r
In other words:\r
M(A, B, C) = dm(A\r
H , BH, CH),\r
where A, B, C ∈ X(P) are smooth vector fields on P.\r
2.2.1 Algebraic preliminaries\r
Let M be a smooth manifold. Consider a differential crossed module G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲).\r
In particular the map (X, e) ∈ g × e 7→ X ⊲ e ∈ e is bilinear.\r
Let a ∈ An(M, g) and b ∈ Am(M, e) be g- and e-valued (respectively) differ\u0002ential forms on M. We define a ⊗⊲\r
b as being the e-valued covariant tensor field\r
on M such that\r
(a⊗\r
⊲\r
b)(A1, . . . , An, B1, . . . Bm) = a(A1, . . . , An)⊲b(B1, . . . , Bm); Ai, Bj ∈ X(M).\r
We also define an alternating tensor field a ∧\r
⊲\r
b ∈ An+m(M, e), being given by\r
a ∧\r
⊲\r
b =\r
(n + m)!\r
n!m!\r
Alt(a ⊗\r
⊲\r
b).\r
Here Alt denotes the natural projection from the vector space of e-valued co\u0002variant tensor fields on M onto the vector space of e-valued differential forms\r
on M.\r
For example, if a ∈ A1(M, g) and b ∈ A2(M, e), then a ∧\r
⊲\r
b satisfies:\r
(a ∧\r
⊲\r
b)(X, Y, Z) = a(X) ⊲ b(Y, Z) + a(Y ) ⊲ b(Z, X) + a(Z) ⊲ b(X, Y ), (10)\r
18

where X, Y, Z ∈ X(M).\r
Note that the formula:\r
d(a ∧\r
⊲\r
b) = da ∧\r
⊲\r
b + (−1)na ∧\r
⊲\r
db,\r
where a ∈ An(M, g) and b ∈ Am(M, e), holds trivially.\r
As as example of this notation, let P → M be a principal G-bundle over\r
the manifold M. Let ω ∈ A1(P, g) be a connection 1-form on M. Then the\r
structure equation for the curvature form Ω = Dω of ω can be written as:\r
Ω = dω +\r
1\r
2\r
ω ∧\r
ad ω,\r
where ad denotes the adjoint action of g on g. Furthermore the Bianchi identity\r
can be written as:\r
dΩ + ω ∧\r
ad Ω = 0;\r
see 1.1.2.\r
2.2.2 The 2-structure equation\r
The following equation is an analogue of Cartan’s structure equation. It will be\r
of prime importance later.\r
Proposition 29 (2-Structure Equation) Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed\r
module. Let P be a principal G-bundle over the manifold M. Let also (ω, m) be\r
a categorical G-connection on P. We have: M = dm+ω ∧\r
⊲ m, where M = Dm\r
is the 2-curvature 3-form of (ω, m). In particular the 2-curvature 3-form M is\r
G-equivariant, in other words: R∗\r
g\r
(M) = g\r
−1 ⊲ M, for each g ∈ G.\r
The proof of the 2-structure equation follows directly from the following\r
lemma.\r
Lemma 30 Let a be a G-equivariant horizontal (n−1)-form in P. Then Da =\r
da + ω ∧\r
⊲ a.\r
Proof. Let X1, . . . , Xn ∈ TuP, extended to a neighbourhood of u ∈ P.\r
If all vectors are horizontal it follows that Da(X1, . . . , Xn) = (da + ω ∧\r
⊲\r
a)(X1, . . . , Xn), since ω is vertical. Suppose that one of the vectors, which\r
we can suppose to be X1, is vertical. We need to prove that (da + ω ∧\r
⊲\r
a)(X1, . . . , Xn) = 0. Choose A ∈ g such that A#\r
u = X1u\r
. By using Car\u0002tan’s magic formula together with the fact that a is horizontal it follows that\r
da(A#, X2, . . . , Xn) = (LA# a)(X2, . . . Xn), where L denotes Lie derivative.\r
Since a is G-equivariant it follows that LA# a = −A ⊲ a. However, (ω ∧\r
⊲\r
a)(A#, X2, . . . , Xn) = ω(A#) ⊲ a(X2, . . . , Xn), since a is horizontal. Note\r
ω(A#) = A.\r
19

2.2.3 The 2-Bianchi identity\r
Fix a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). Let P be a smooth principal G\u0002bundle over M with a connection ω. Choose a G-categorical connection (ω, m)\r
on P.\r
Proposition 31 (2-Bianchi identity) Let M ∈ A3(P, e) be the 2-curvature\r
3-form of (ω, m). Then the exterior covariant derivative DM of M vanishes.\r
In other words:\r
dM ◦ (H × H × H × H) = 0,\r
which by lemma 30 is the same as:\r
dM + ω ∧\r
⊲ M = 0.\r
Proof. Let us prove the second form of the 2-Bianchi identity. By the\r
2-structure equation it follows that:\r
dM = ddm+d(ω∧\r
⊲ m) = dω∧⊲ m−ω∧⊲\r
dm = dω∧\r
⊲ m−ω∧⊲ M+ω∧⊲\r
(ω ∧\r
⊲ m).\r
Given that ω ∧\r
⊲\r
(ω ∧\r
⊲ m) = 1\r
2\r
(ω ∧\r
ad ω) ∧⊲ m we can conclude:\r
dM = (dω +\r
1\r
2\r
ω ∧\r
ad ω)∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M = Ω ∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M = ∂(m)∧⊲ m−ω ∧⊲ M.\r
We now prove that ∂(m) ∧\r
⊲ m = 0. Since G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) is a differential\r
crossed module we have, for any vector fields X, Y, Z, W ∈ X(P):\r
∂(m)(X, Y ) ⊲ m(Z, W) = ∂\r
\r
m(X, Y )\r
\u0001\r
⊲ m(Z, W) = [m(X, Y ), m(Z, W)].\r
Let us see that Alt[m, m] = 0, which implies that ∂(m) ∧\r
⊲ m = 0. The\r
permutation r such that r(X, Y, Z, W) = (Z, W, X, Y ) is even. In particular\r
Alt([m, m]) = Alt([m, m] ◦ r). However, [m, m] ◦ r = −[m, m].\r
2.2.4 Local form of a categorical connection\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be some Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲)\r
be the associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M and\r
a smooth principal G-bundle P → M, with a categorical G-connection (ω, m),\r
where, as usual, ω ∈ A1(P, g) and m ∈ A2(P, e).\r
The local form of the categorical G-connection (ω, m) is similar to the local\r
form of a connection. Let {Uα} be an open covering of the manifold M. We can\r
suppose that each Uα is contractible and that, for each α and β, the intersection\r
Uα ∩ Uβ is contractible; see [BT]. Therefore, for each α, the restriction Pα of\r
P to Uα is trivial, and, in particular, it admits a section fα : Uα → Pα. The\r
local form of a categorical G-connection is therefore given by the family of forms\r
ωa = f\r
∗\r
α(ω) and mα = f\r
∗\r
α(m).\r
For each α, by the structure equation, the local curvature form Ωα = f\r
∗\r
α(Ω)\r
takes the form\r
Ωα = dωα +\r
1\r
2\r
ωα ∧\r
ad ωα.\r
20

Locally, the Bianchi identity reads:\r
dΩα + ωα ∧\r
ad Ωα = 0.\r
Analogously, from the 2-structure equation, locally in each Uα, the 2-curvature\r
3-form Mα = f\r
∗\r
α(M) takes the form:\r
Mα = dmα + ωα ∧\r
⊲ mα,\r
and the 2-Bianchi identity reads:\r
dMα + ωα ∧\r
⊲ Mα = 0.\r
These local expressions correspond to the formulae in [B] when the fake curva\u0002ture vanishes.\r
Let φα,β : Ua ∩ Uβ → G be defined as fα(x)φα,β(x) = fβ(x), for each x ∈\r
Uα ∩ Uβ. We have:\r
ωβ(X) = φ\r
−1\r
α,βω(X)φα,β + φ\r
−1\r
α,βdφα,β, (11)\r
Ωβ(X, Y ) = φ\r
−1\r
α,βΩ(X, Y )φα,β, (12)\r
for each X, Y ∈ X(M). Since both m and M are G-equivariant and horizontal,\r
it follows that for each α, β:\r
mβ(X, Y ) = φ\r
−1\r
α,β ⊲ mα(X, Y ), (13)\r
Mβ(X, Y, Z) = φ\r
−1\r
α,β ⊲ Mα(X, Y, Z), (14)\r
for each X, Y, Z ∈ X(M).\r
Lemma 32 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie\r
crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed\r
module. Suppose π: P → M is the trivial bundle M × G. Given m0 ∈ A2(M, e)\r
and ω0 ∈ A1(M, g), such that ∂(m0) = Ω0 = dω0 +\r
1\r
2\r
ω0 ∧\r
ad ω0, there exists a\r
categorical G-connection (ω, m) on P such that its local form is (ω0, m0).\r
Proof. Let θ be the canonical g-valued left-invariant 1-form on G; see 2.4.2.\r
Then ω = g\r
−1π∗\r
(ω0)g + θ is a connection 1-form on M × G, and its local form,\r
considering the section f : M → P such that, for each x ∈ M, f(x) = (x, 1G),\r
is ω0. The 2-form π\r
∗\r
(m0) ∈ A2(P, e) is horizontal. However, it is not G\u0002equivariant. Therefore we define m ∈ A2\r
(M × G, e) as being such that, given\r
X, Y ∈ T(x,g)P, we have:\r
m(X, Y ) = g\r
−1\r
⊲ π∗(m0)(X, Y ),\r
where g ∈ G, x ∈ M and X, Y ∈ T(x,g)M × G. This 2-form is obviously smooth\r
and horizontal. Moreover, given X, Y ∈ T(x,g)P it follows that:\r
(R\r
∗\r
hm)(X, Y ) = m(Xh, Y h)\r
= (gh)\r
−1\r
⊲ π∗(m0)(Xh, Y h)\r
= h\r
−1\r
g\r
−1\r
⊲ π∗(m0)(X, Y )\r
= h\r
−1\r
⊲ m(X, Y ).\r
21

Therefore m is G-equivariant. Let Ω be the curvature of ω. Then Ω(X, Y ) =\r
g\r
−1π∗\r
(Ω0)(X, Y )g, where as before X, Y ∈ T(x,g)P. In particular it follows that\r
Ω = ∂(m).\r
The following follows from the previous discussion.\r
Corollary 33 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be\r
a Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential\r
crossed module. Let {Uα} be an open cover of M, such that the restriction Pα\r
of P to Uα is the trivial bundle. Let also fα : Uα → Pα be local sections of\r
P. Define φα,β : Uα ∩ Uβ → G as fα(x)φα,β(x) = fβ(x). Suppose that for\r
each α we are given forms ωα ∈ A1(Uα, g) and mα ∈ A2(Uα, e), satisfying\r
∂(mα) = Ωα = dωα +\r
1\r
2\r
ωα ∧\r
ad ωα. Moreover, suppose that for each α, β with\r
Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅ equations (11) and (13) are satisfied. There exists a unique cat\u0002egorical connection (ω, m) on P such that the forms ωα and mα are its local\r
form.\r
The trivial bundle M × G → M always admits the trivial categorical con\u0002nection, whose local form is given by the forms ω0 = 0 and m0 = 0. However,\r
there exist several other examples for the trivial bundle. Let A = ∂(E), and let\r
a be its Lie algebra. There exists a linear map r : a → e such that ∂ ◦ r = ida.\r
Let ω0 be any a-valued 1-form on M. Let Ω0 be the curvature of ω0 and define\r
m0 = r(Ω0). Then (ω0, m0) is the local form of a categorical G-connection on\r
M × G. In fact, let B = ker ∂ ⊂ E. Therefore B is closed under the action of G\r
on E, by the first condition of the definition of crossed modules; see definition\r
3. Let b be the Lie algebra of B. Given any b-valued 2-form ρ0 on M then\r
ρ0 + m0 is the local form of a categorical G-connection on M × G.\r
It is not a trivial problem whether there always exists a categorical G\u0002connection on any principal G-bundle. This issue is very likely to depend on the\r
topology of the manifold. The strategy of combining locally defined connection\r
1-forms ω using a partition of unity cannot be carried through for the 2-forms\r
m, since ∂(m) = Ω, which is not C∞-linear in ω.\r
2.3 Categorical holonomy\r
2.3.1 Definition of a holonomy.\r
The following definition appears in [CP].\r
Definition 34 (Holonomy) Let M and N be smooth manifolds. Suppose that\r
M has a chosen base point ∗. A map F : π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → N is said to be smooth if,\r
for any 2-path Γ: [0, 1]2 → M, with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗, the map\r
s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F([γs]) ∈ N\r
is smooth. Here Γ(t, s) = γs(t), where s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Let G be a Lie group. A holonomy is, by definition, a smooth group morphism\r
π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G.\r
The following result appears in [CP].\r
22

Theorem 35 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. Let also G\r
be a Lie group. Let P → M be a smooth principal G-bundle over M with a\r
connection ω. Let u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P at ∗. Then the parallel transport of ω\r
determines a holonomy F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
: π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G.\r
Proof. Recall the notation of 1.1.3. Given a 1-path γ : [0, 1] → M, with\r
γ(0), γ(1) = ∗, define F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
(γ) to be the unique element of G such that u =\r
Hω(γ, 1, u)F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
(γ). Then, if Γ is a 2-path, with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗, it follows\r
that the map\r
s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
(γs) ∈ G,\r
where Γ(t, s) = γs(t); s, t ∈ [0, 1], is smooth. This follows from the fact that the\r
map t ∈ [0, 1] 7→ Hω(γs, t, u) is a solution of a differential equation in t. This\r
differential equation depends smoothly on s if Γ is smooth. For details see [KN,\r
page 74].\r
The fact that F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
descends to a map π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G follows from lemma 2\r
and the fact that the horizontal lift of vectors defines a linear map. Finally the\r
fact that F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
is a group morphism follows from the fact that Hω\r
\r
γ\r
2γ1\r
, 1, u\u0001=\r
Hω\r
\r
γ\r
1\r
, 1, Hω(γ\r
2\r
, 1, u)\r
\u0001\r
, for any smooth curves γ\r
1 and γ2\r
in M starting and\r
ending at ∗.\r
It is proved in [CP] that any holonomy π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G arises from a bundle\r
with connection in this way.\r
2.3.2 Definition of a categorical holonomy\r
Definition 36 (3-path) Let M be a manifold. A smooth map J : [0, 1]3 → M,\r
say J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s) = γ\r
x\r
s\r
(t), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1], is said to be a 3-path if:\r
1. J is constant over {0} × [0, 1]2 and over {1} × [0, 1]2.\r
2. J restricts to a rank-1 homotopy (connecting γ\r
0\r
0 with γ\r
1\r
0\r
) over [0, 1]×{0}×\r
[0, 1] and over [0, 1] × {1} × [0, 1] (connecting γ\r
0\r
1 with γ\r
1\r
1\r
).\r
3. J has a product structure close to the boundary of [0, 1]3; see definition\r
19.\r
In particular J defines a homotopy connecting the 2-paths Γ0 and Γ1; see 1.3.6.\r
Note that it is not necessarily a rank-2 homotopy.\r
Definition 37 Let M and N be smooth manifolds. Consider the projection\r
map S2(M) → S2(M). A map F : S2(M) → N is said to be smooth if, for any\r
3-path J, the map\r
x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ F([Γx]) ∈ N\r
is smooth. Here J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s), for each (t, s, x) ∈ [0, 1]3.\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Consider the categorical\r
group C(G) constructed from G, see 1.2.1. Its set of objects is G and its set\r
of morphisms is the semidirect product G ⋉ E of G and E; all of these are\r
23

smooth manifolds. The following definition extends the definition of holonomy\r
for principal G-bundles of [CP] and should be compared with analogous non\u0002strict constructions in [BS, MP, M].\r
Definition 38 (Categorical holonomy) Let M be a smooth manifold. Choose\r
an element ∗ ∈ M. A categorical holonomy is, by definition, a strict monoidal\r
functor (in other words a categorical group morphism) F : P2(M, ∗) → C(G),\r
such that the associated maps F1 : π\r
1\r
1\r
(M) → G and F2 : P2(M, ∗) → G ⋉ E on\r
the sets of objects and morphisms of P2(M, ∗) are smooth. Here P2(M, ∗) is the\r
thin fundamental categorical group of M; see 1.3.4.\r
If we use the notation\r

2.4 Categorical connections and categorical connection holonomies\r
The aim of this subsection is to prove the following main theorem.\r
Theorem 39 Let G be a Lie group. Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also P →\r
M be a smooth principal fibre bundle with structure group G. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
be a Lie crossed module. A G-categorical connection (ω, m) on P together with\r
an element u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P over ∗ ∈ M, determines a categorical holonomy\r
F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G), which we call a categorical connection holonomy,\r
since it arises from a categorical connection.\r
For the rest of this subsection, fix a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲),\r
and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed module. Consider\r
also a smooth manifold M and a principal G-bundle P over M, as well as a G\u0002categorical connection (ω, m) on P.\r
2.4.1 Defining a categorical holonomy from a categorical connection\r
Consider a base point ∗ ∈ M. Choose also u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P at ∗. To\r
describe F(ω,m,u) on the set π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) of objects of P2(M, ∗), we use theorem 35.\r
Therefore we define:\r
F\r
1\r
(ω,m,u)\r
([γ]) = F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
([γ]), where [γ] ∈ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗). (18)\r
Let now Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. Let γs(t) = Γ(t, s); s, t ∈\r
[0, 1]. To define F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
, consider the smooth function s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ eΓ(s) ∈ E,\r
which solves the following differential equation in E:\r
d\r

with initial condition eΓ(0) = 1E. Set eΓ = eΓ(1) to be the element of E assigned\r
to the 2-path Γ. Then we define:\r
F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Γ) = \u0010F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
\r
[∂d(Γ)]\u0001, eΓ\r
\u0011\r
. (20)\r
Recall the elements gγs ∈ G, where s ∈ [0, 1], which are given by the\r
condition: ugγs = Hω(γs, 1, u); see 1.1.4. Thus F\r
1\r
(ω,m,u)\r
([γs]) = g\r

coming from a categorical connection coincides with definition 2.32 of [BS].\r

where Γ is a 2-path in M such that ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗, and Γ(t, s) = γs(t); ∀s, t ∈\r
[0, 1], depends only on the rank-2 homotopy class to which Γ belongs, and defines\r
a monoidal functor P2(M, ∗) → C(G), such that the induced maps on the set of\r
objects and morphisms of P2(M, ∗) are smooth.\r
First of all:\r
Lemma 40 Let Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. Then for each\r
s ∈ [0, 1] we have: gγ0 ∂(eΓ(s)) = gγs. Here Γ(t, s) = γs(t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Proof. The previous equation holds for s = 0, by definition of eΓ(s). We have:\r
d\r
ds\r
\r
gγ0 ∂(eΓ(s))\u0001= gγ0\r
d\r
ds∂ (eΓ(s)) = gγ0 ∂\r
\u0012\r
d\r
ds eΓ(s)\r
\u0013\r
,\r
therefore:\r
d\r

\r
gγ0 ∂(eΓ(s))\u0001= gγ0 ∂\r
\u0010\r

 \r

since ∂(m) = Ω. By equation (7) we also have:\r
d\r

0\r
Ω\r
 \r
∂^∂tγs(t),\r
∂^∂sγs(t)\r
!\r
Hω(γs,t,u)\r
.\r
Thus both sides of the equation are solutions of the same differential equation\r
in G, and have the same initial condition.\r
We remark that, using the terminology of [BS], this result corresponds to\r
the condition that a local pre-2-holonomy gives rise to a local true 2-holonomy,\r
which there also follows from the vanishing of the fake curvature.\r
Let Γ: [0, 1]2 → M be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. We need\r
to prove that F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Γ) depends only on the 2-track defined by Γ, in other\r
words on the rank-2 homotopy class of 2-paths to which Γ belongs. This will\r
be shown shortly in Corollary 43 of Theorem 42. For now, consider a 3-path J,\r
where J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s); ∀t, s, x ∈ [0, 1], defining a homotopy (not necessarily\r
rank-2) connecting the 2-paths Γ0 and Γ1. Suppose that ∂l(Γ0), ∂r(Γ0) = ∗,\r
thus ∂l(Γ1), ∂r(Γ1) = ∗. We want to calculate ∂\r
∂xeΓx (s), where s, x ∈ [0, 1].\r
In fact, for later applications, we will consider the more general case when,\r
for each x ∈ [0, 1], we have that ∂l(Γx) = q(x) and ∂r(Γx) = q(x), where\r
q : [0, 1] → M is a smooth map. This generality will be important to define\r
Wilson spheres in 2.5.3. The lemma in the following subsection will be useful\r
for our purpose.\r
26

2.4.2 A well-known lemma\r
Let G be a Lie group. Consider a g-valued smooth function V (s, x) defined on\r
[0, 1]2. Consider the following differential equation in G:\r
∂\r
∂sa(s, x) = a(s, x)V (s, x),\r
with initial condition a(0, x) = 1G, ∀x ∈ [0, 1]. We want to know ∂\r
∂xa(s, x).\r
Let θ be the canonical g-valued 1-form on G. Thus θ is left invariant and\r
satisfies θ(A) = A, ∀A ∈ g, being defined uniquely by these properties. Also\r
dθ(A, B) = −θ([A, B]), (21)\r
where A, B ∈ g. We have:\r
∂\r
∂xθ\r
\u0012\r
∂\r
∂sa(s, x)\r
\u0013\r

∂\r
∂xθ\r
\r
a(s, x)V (s, x)\r
\u0001\r

On the other hand:\r

for each x, s ∈ [0, 1].\r
2.4.3 The dependence of the surface holonomy on a smooth family\r
of surfaces\r
The discussion in this subsection will be very similar to that of 1.1.4. We want\r
to prove an analogue of lemma 2 for the surface holonomy of a family of 2-paths\r
Γ\r
x\r
.\r
Consider a smooth map J : [0, 1]3 → M, where J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s); ∀t, s, x ∈\r
[0, 1]. Given x, s ∈ [0, 1], a smooth curve γ\r
x\r

: [0, 1] → M is defined as γ\r
x\r
s\r
(t) =\r
27

J(t, s, x), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose that, for each x ∈ [0, 1], there exists\r
q(x) ∈ M such that J(0, s, x) = J(1, s, x) = q(x) for each s ∈ [0, 1]. In other\r
words ∂l(Γx) = ∂r(Γx) = q(x). Note that the map x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ q(x) ∈ M is\r
necessarily smooth. Let q(0) = ∗ ∈ M. Choose u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P at ∗. Let\r
also ux = Hω(q, x, u), where x ∈ [0, 1]. In particular u0 = u.\r
Note that the conditions above imply that:\r
Rank(D(s,x)J)(t,s,x) ≤ 1 if t = 0 or t = 1, for each s, x ∈ [0, 1]. (22)\r
Suppose that we also have:\r
Rank(D(t,x)J)(t,s,x) ≤ 1 if s = 0 or s = 1, for each t, x ∈ [0, 1]. (23)\r
For each x ∈ [0, 1], let s ∈ [0, 1] 7→ eΓx (s) ∈ E be the solution of the\r
differential equation in E:\r

See equation (19). Our purpose is to calculate the x-dependence of eΓx =\r
eΓx (1), the element of E assigned to Γx, by calculating d\r
dx eΓx . The result of this\r
calculation, Theorem 42, is entirely analogous to Lemma 2, with the 2-curvature\r

that f(x, s, t) = Hω(γ\r

The first equation follows by definition of eΓx (s), the second since the e-valued\r

well-known formula (21). Finally, the last equation follows since (∂ : e → g, ⊲)\r

The following is a 2-dimensional version of Lemma 2.\r
Theorem 42 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie\r
crossed module. Let P → M be a principal G-bundle over M. Consider a G\u0002categorical connection (ω, m) on P. Let J : [0, 1]3 → M be a smooth map. Let\r
J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s) = γ\r

(t); ∀t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Suppose that ∂l(Γx) = ∂r(Γx) =\r
q(x), ∀x ∈ [0, 1], where q : [0, 1] → M is a smooth curve. Choose u ∈ Pq(0), the\r
fibre of P at q(0). Let also ux = Hω(q, x, u), where x ∈ [0, 1]. In particular\r
u0 = u.\r
Consider the map (s, x) ∈ [0, 1]27→ eΓx (s) ∈ E defined by equations (24)\r

by equations (28) and (29). Comparing with equation (27), yields theorem 42.\r
From this theorem and the fact that the horizontal lift X 7→ Xe of vector\r
fields on M defines a linear map X(M) → X(P) we obtain the following:\r
Corollary 43 Let M be a smooth manifold with a base point ∗. Let also\r
G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let P → M be a principal G\u0002bundle over M, and let u ∈ P∗, the fibre at ∗ ∈ M. Consider a G-categorical\r
32

connection (ω, m) on P. Let Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. Let\r
Γ(t, s) = γs(t), for each t, s ∈ [0, 1]. Then F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Γ) = (g\r
−1\r
γ0\r
, eΓ) depends only\r
on the rank-2 homotopy class of 2-tracks [Γ] to which Γ belongs.\r
Consider a crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). Let the categorical group it\r
defines be C(G); see 1.2.1. Let also be given a smooth manifold M with a base\r
point ∗, a principal G-bundle P over M and G-categorical connection (ω, m) on\r
P. We defined maps F\r
1\r
(ω,m,u)\r
: π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G (the sets of objects of P(M, ∗) and\r
of C(G), respectively) and F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
: P2(M, ∗) → G ⋉ E (the sets of morphisms\r
of P(M, ∗) and C(G), respectively). We now prove that this assignment, defined\r
in 2.4.1, is a categorical holonomy. This will complete the proof of theorem 39.\r
2.4.4 Re-scaling\r
Let Γ be a 2-path in M such that ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. As usual put Γ(t, s) =\r
γs(t); s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Consider a smooth map f : [a, b] → [0, 1], where −∞ < a <\r
b < +∞. We suppose that f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 1. Let Γ′(s, t) = γ\r
′\r
s\r
(t) be such\r
that γ\r
′\r
s\r
(t) = γf(s)(t), where s ∈ [a, b] and t ∈ [0, 1]. Even though Γ′is not a\r
2-path, for its domain is [0, 1] × [a, b], the elements gγ′\r
s\r
∈ E and eΓ′ (s) ∈ E,\r
where s ∈ [a, b], defined in 2.4.1, still make sense.\r
Lemma 44 We have\r
gγ′\r
s = gγf(s)\r
and eΓ′ (s) = eΓ(f(s)),\r
for each s ∈ [a, b].\r
Proof. The first equation follows since γ\r
′\r
s = γf(s)\r
, as curves [0, 1] → M, for\r
each s ∈ [a, b]. As for the second one we have:\r
d\r
ds eΓ′ (s) = eΓ′ (s)\r
Z 1\r

Whereas:\r

Therefore s 7→ eΓ′ (s) and s 7→ eΓ(f(s)) are both solutions of the same differential\r
equation and they have the same initial conditions.\r

2.4.5 Verification of the axioms for a categorical holonomy\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the\r
associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M with a base\r
point ∗, a principal G-bundle P over M and an element u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P\r
over ∗. Consider a categorical connection (ω, m) on P. Let us prove that the\r
assignments\r
[γ] ∈ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) 7→ F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
([γ]) ∈ G\r
and\r
[Γ] ∈ P2(M, ∗) 7→ F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
([Γ]) ∈ G ⋉ E,\r
defined in 2.4.1, yield a categorical holonomy F(ω,m,u): P(M, ∗) → C(G). To\r
begin with, let us see that F(ω,m,u) defines a monoidal functor P2(M, ∗) → C(G).\r
Here C(G) is the categorical group constructed from G; see 1.2.1.\r
Claim: F(ω,m,u)is a functor.\r
Proof. Recall that the source and target maps in a category are denoted\r
by σ and τ, respectively. Let Γ be a 2-path in M such that ∂l(Γ), ∂r(Γ) = ∗.\r
As usual put Γ(t, s) = γs(t);t, s ∈ [0, 1]. We have:\r
σ\r

\r

γ0 = F1 (σ([Γ])).\r
On the other hand by lemma 40:\r

∗. Suppose also that ∂u(Γ1) = ∂d(Γ2). For each s, t ∈ [0, 1], put Γ1(t, s) = γ\r
1\r

and Γ2(t, s) = γ\r
2\r

We have therefore proven that F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G) is a monoidal\r
functor, and therefore a categorical group map.\r
Claim: The functor F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G) is smooth both on the sets\r
π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) and P2(M, ∗) of objects and morphisms of P2(M, ∗).\r
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of F(ω,m,u), and from the\r
lemma on page 74 of [KN].\r
The proof of theorem 39 is complete.\r
2.4.6 2-Bundles\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let the associated differential\r
crossed module be G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲). Fix a smooth manifold M and a smooth\r
principal G-bundle π: P → M.\r
A natural weakening of the notion of a categorical connection (ω, m) in P is\r
to consider m to be only locally defined on P, but so that ∂(mi) = Ω, for any\r
i. Here mi ∈ A2(Pi, e), where Pi = π\r
−1\r
(Ui) and {Ui} is an open cover of P.\r
This can be done by using the general theory of 2-bundles [BS], or non-abelian\r
gerbes [BrMe], which correspond to 2-bundles with structure crossed modules\r
of the form G = Aut(E) of example 11.\r
To this end, let {Ui} be an open cover of M. We can suppose that, for any\r
i1, . . . , in, the n-fold intersection Ui1,...,in\r
.= Ui1 ∩ . . . ∩ Uin\r
is contractible. A G\u00022-bundle can be described by using smooth maps gij : Uij → G and hijk : Uijk →\r
E. These have to satisfy the cocycle conditions: ∂(h\r
−1\r
ijk)gijgjk = gik and hijkhikl =\r
(gij ⊲ hjkl) hijl for any i, j, k, l. Therefore a G-2-bundle does not necessarily de\u0002fine a G-principal bundle, unless ∂(hijk) = 1 for each i, j, k. If this condition is\r
satisfied, a G-2-bundle will be called a special G-2-bundle.\r
The main purpose of this article was the construction of categorical holonomies,\r
in other words of smooth categorical group maps P2(M, ∗) → C(G), or, equiva\u0002lently of smooth crossed module maps Π2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) → G; see 1.3 for this notation.\r
From the point of view of 2-dimensional holonomy, G-2-bundles are natural ob\u0002jects; see [BS]. However, our notion of categorical holonomy requires the exis\u0002tence of a smooth group morphism π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G, and therefore of a principal\r
G-bundle with connection; see [CP]. This makes it natural to work with special\r
G-2-bundles.\r
A special G-2-bundle with connection can be specified by the following data:\r
(Here A = ker(∂) ⊂ E, and a is its Lie algebra; note that A is central in E).\r
1. A principal G-bundle π: P → M with a connection ω.\r
37

2. An open cover {Ui} of M such that for any i1, . . . , in the n-fold intersection\r
Ui1,...,inis contractible. Let Pi1,...,in = π\r
−1\r
(Ui1,...,in).\r
3. G-equivariant A-valued functions eijk : Pijk → A. These are required to\r
satisfy: eijkeikl = ejkleijl.\r
4. G-equivariant horizontal 2-forms mi ∈ A2(Pi, e). These are required to\r
satisfy ∂(mi) = Ω, the curvature 2-form of ω.\r
5. G-equivariant horizontal 1-forms ηij ∈ A1(Pij , a). These are required to\r
satisfy:\r
mi − mj = Dηij and \u0010De−1\r
ijk\u0011\r
eijk = ηij + ηjk − ηik,\r
where D denotes the exterior covariant derivative with respect to ω, in\r
other words, by using lemma 30,\r
mi−mj = dηij+ω∧\r
⊲\r
ηij and \u0010de−1\r
ijk + ω ∧\r
⊲\r
e\r
−1\r
ijk\u0011\r
eijk = ηij+ηjk−ηik.\r
One passes from this setting to the setting in [BS] by choosing local sections fi\r
of Pi, and defining the functions gij : Uij → G in the usual way: figij = fj. Next\r
define hijk = f\r
∗\r
i\r
(eijk), Ai = f\r
∗\r
i\r
(ω), Bi = f\r
∗\r
i\r
(mi) and aij = f\r
∗\r
i\r
(ηij ). Then this\r
data defines the local differential forms of Baez and Schreiber [BS], satisfying\r
equations corresponding to our special G-2-bundles with connection, in partic\u0002ular with the transition functions gij satisfying the usual cocycle condition for\r
a principal G-bundle. Note that the Baez-Schreiber local differential forms can\r
be seen as a generalisation to arbitrary G of the local description of non-abelian\r
gerbes, with G = Aut(E), of Breen and Messing [BrMe].\r
Special G-2-bundles with connection define group morphisms π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G.\r
However, the definition of the categorical holonomy on a 2-track [Γ] ∈ P2(M, ∗)\r
is tricky if one is to deal with the fact that m is not globally defined. This can be\r
done (and will appear in a future work), however, it will only be, a priori, defined\r
up to multiplication by central elements of E, and thus it should not define\r
holonomies P2(M, ∗) → C(G), unless we restrict to elements of π\r
2\r
2\r
(M, ∗), as in\r
[MP]. For instance, it is easy to see that given two categorical G-connections\r
(ω, m) and (ω, m′) in P then given a 2-path Γ ∈ P2(M, ∗) we have\r

(P, a) is G-equivariant and\r

′\r
Γ denote\r
2-dimensional holonomy with respect to (ω, m) and (ω, m′), respectively.\r
For this reason we feel that it is likely that the construction in this article,\r
with a globally defined m, will describe all categorical holonomies P2(M, ∗) →\r
C(G), especially if we consider a generalised unbased setting. We will investigate\r
this issue in a future publication.\r

2.5 Wilson Spheres\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module, and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be\r
the associated differential crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M and a\r
smooth principal G-bundle P → M, with a connection ω ∈ A1(P, g), as well as\r
a G-categorical connection (ω, m). The aim of this subsection is to define the\r
categorical holonomy of a 2-sphere Σ embedded in M.\r
2.5.1 The dependence of a categorical connection holonomy on the\r
elements of the fibre\r
Choose u, v ∈ P. We want to relate F(ω,m,u) with F(ω,m,v). Suppose first that\r
u, v each belong to the fibre Px of P at a certain point x ∈ M. Let g ∈ G be\r
the unique element such that u = vg. Let γ be a 1-path of M starting and\r
ending at x. Then Hω(γ, 1, u) = Hω(γ, 1, vg) = Hω(γ, 1, v)g. Therefore since\r
Hω(γ, 1, u)F\r
1\r
(ω,u)\r
(γ) = u and Hω(γ, 1, v)F\r
1\r
(ω,v)\r
(γ) = v we have the well-known\r
formula:\r

(γ) = gF1\r
(ω,u)\r
(γ)g\r
−1\r
, (31)\r
for γ a smooth curve starting and ending at x and u = vg, where u, v ∈ Px and\r
g ∈ G.\r
Let us now see how F\r
2\r
(m,ω,u)\r
is related to F\r
2\r
(m,ω,v)\r
.\r
Lemma 45 For any 2-path Γ in M, with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = x, we have:\r
F\r
2\r
(ω,m,v)\r
(Γ) = g ⊲ F2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Γ), (32)\r
where u, v belong to the fibre Px of P, and g ∈ G is such that u = vg.\r
Proof. As usual, put Γ(t, s) = γs(t); s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Let eΓ(s) and fΓ(s) be defined\r
by the differential equations:\r

There is a natural left action of G on G⋉E, given by g⊲(h, e) = (ghg−1, g⊲e).\r
Using this, we can summarise the results of this subsection, equations (31) and\r
(32), in the following:\r
Theorem 46 If v ∈ Px then\r
F(ω,m,vg) = g\r
−1\r
⊲ F(ω,m,v) (33)\r
for any g ∈ G.\r
2.5.2 The dependence of a categorical connection holonomy on the\r
point in the principal bundle\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Fix a smooth manifold M,\r
and a smooth principal G-bundle P → M with a connection ω ∈ A1(P, g). Let\r
(ω, m) be a G-categorical connection on P. Let x, y ∈ M. Choose v ∈ Py.\r
Let µ be a 1-path connecting y with x. This curve µ defines a categorical\r
group isomorphism Tµ : P2(M, y) → P2(M, x) in the obvious way, by considering\r
horizontal compositions. More precisely let Γµ be the 2-path such that Γµ(t, s) =\r
µ(t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Let also Γµ−1 (t, s) = µ\r
−1\r
(t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1]. Then Tµ([Γ]) .=\r
[Γµ−1 ] ◦h [Γ] ◦h [Γµ] ∈ P2(M, x) for each [Γ] ∈ P2(M, y), and Tµ([γ]) = [µ\r
−1γµ]\r
for [µ] ∈ π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, y).\r
Theorem 47 Let u = Hω(µ, 1, v). We have:\r
F(ω,m,v) = F(ω,m,u) ◦ Tµ. (34)\r
Proof. Let [Γ] ∈ P2(M, y). Then [Γ] = [Γµ] ◦h Tµ([Γ]) ◦h [Γµ−1 ]. Let Γ1 =\r
Γµ ◦h Γµ−1 ◦h Γ ◦h Γµ ◦h Γµ−1 , thus [Γ1\r
] = [Γ]. Put γs(t) = Γ1(t, s); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
40

Let also Γ′ = Γµ−1 ◦h Γ◦h Γµ, thus [Γ′\r
] = Tµ[Γ]. Put γ\r
′\r
s\r
(t) = Γ′(t, s); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
We have\r
d\r
ds eΓ1 (s) = eΓ1 (s)\r

The second equation follows since Γµ(s, t) does not depend on s. Comparing\r
with equation 19 it follows that eΓ1 (s) = eΓ′ (s), for each s ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore:\r
F\r
2\r
(ω,m,v)\r
([Γ]) = F\r

(ω,m,v)\r
([Γ1]) = eΓ1 = eΓ′ = F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
([Γ′]) = F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Tµ([Γ])).\r
This finishes the proof of the result at the level of the elements of P2(M, y).\r
The proof at the level of the elements of π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, y) is similar.\r
2.5.3 Associating 2-holonomies to embedded spheres\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let M be a smooth mani\u0002fold. Consider a principal G-bundle P over M with a G-categorical connection\r
(ω, m). Consider an embedded oriented 2-sphere Σ ⊂ M. We want to define\r
the categorical holonomy of Σ, which we call a Wilson Sphere, by analogy with\r
Wilson loops, familiar in gauge theory.\r
Definition 48 Choose an orientation preserving parametrisation\r
S\r
2 = D2\r
/∂D\r
2 φ\r
−→ Σ ⊂ M\r
of Σ. Let ∗ = φ(∂D2) ∈ Σ ⊂ M. Choose u ∈ P∗, the fibre of P at ∗. The\r
categorical holonomy of Σ is defined as:\r
W(ω,m)(Σ, φ, u) = F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(φ) ∈ ker(∂) ⊂ E.\r
The fact that the categorical holonomy W(ω,m)(Σ, φ, u) lives in ker(∂) ⊂ E\r
follows from the fact that ∂d(φ) = ∂u(φ) = ∗, and lemma 40.\r
Theorem 49 The categorical holonomy W(ω,m)(Σ, φ, u) does not depend on φ\r
and u, up to acting by an element of G. Therefore, we can define a categorical\r
holonomy W(ω,m)(Σ) of embedded 2-spheres Σ in M (the Wilson Sphere), tak\u0002ing values in E/G. If Σ\r
∗\r
is obtained from Σ by reversing its orientation then\r
W(ω,m)(Σ∗) = W(ω,m)(Σ)\u0001−1.\r
41

Example 50 Consider the U(1)-bundle P\r
n over S2 with Chern class n, where\r
n ∈ Z. Define a crossed module G given by the exponential map exp: iR → U(1),\r
considering the trivial action of U(1) on iR. Consider some connection 1-form\r
ω on Pn, thus (ω, Ω) is a categorical G-connection on P\r
n. We will then have\r
that W(ω,Ω)(S\r
2\r
) = n.\r
Proof. (Theorem 49) The independence of W(ω,m)(Σ, φ, u) on the choice\r
of u ∈ P∗, up to acting by an element of G, follows from theorem 46.\r
Choose a different orientation preserving parametrisation D2/∂D2\r
φ\r
′\r
−→ Σ\r
of Σ. Since both φ and φ\r
′ are orientation preserving, there exists a smooth 1-\r
parameter family of embeddings x ∈ [0, 1] 7→ φx connecting φ and φ\r
′\r
. Here φx is\r
an orientation preserving parametrisation φx : D2/∂D2 → Σ, for each x ∈ [0, 1].\r
Let q : [0, 1] → M be the map such that q(x) = φx(∂([0, 1]2)), ∀x ∈ [0, 1];\r
therefore ∗ = q(0). Put Γx(t, s)\r
.= φx(t, s), where t, s, x ∈ [0, 1]. Therefore\r
∂l(Γx) = ∂r(Γx) = q(x), for each x ∈ [0, 1]. Let also J(t, s, x)\r
.= Γx\r
(t, s), where\r
t, s, x ∈ [0, 1].\r
The map J : [0, 1]3 → Σ ⊂ M satisfies the conditions of theorem 42. In\r
particular\r
W(ω,m)(Σ, φ0, u) = eΓ0 = eΓ1 = W(ω,m)(Σ, φ1, Hω(q, 1, u)),\r
since certainly Rank(DzJ) ≤ 2, ∀z ∈ [0, 1]3.\r
Finally, let φ\r
−1\r
(x, y) = φ(1 − x, y); ∀x, y ∈ [0, 1]. It does not follow that\r
φ\r
−1 ◦h φ is rank-2 homotopic to ∗ in a strict sense, since a homotopy connecting\r
φ\r
−1 ◦h φ with ∗ will have some singular points, as φ and φ−1 are not 2-paths,\r
because they fail the sitting instant conditions.\r
Let γs(t) = φ(t, s) and γ\r
′\r
s\r
(t) = φ\r
−1\r
(t, s), where t, s ∈ [0, 1]. Let us analyse\r

The result follows from the fact that if A(t) is a smooth function [0, 1] → E and if\r
w(s) is a solution of d\r
dsw(s) = w(s)A(s) then the smooth function v(s)\r
.= w(s)\r
−1\r
is a solution of d\r
ds v(s) = −A(s)v(s). In particular eφ−1 (1) = e\r
−1\r
φ\r

Note that the previous proof uses, in an essential way, the fact that the\r
mapping class group of S\r
2\r
is {±1}. Therefore, it is likely that the previous\r
theorem does not extend to an embedded surface of genus greater than zero.\r
However, it is probable that this can be fixed if any embedded surface Σ ⊂ M\r
is assigned an equivalence class of embedding S → Σ, where two embeddings\r
φ, φ′: S → Σ are equivalent if φ\r
−1 ◦φ′\r
is isotopic to the identity diffeomorphism.\r
We will analyse this issue in a subsequent publication.\r
3 Appendix: Technical Lemmas\r
The following lemmas provide the foundation for the construction of the 2-\r
category S2(M), defined for any smooth manifold M. Specifically, lemma 52 is\r
used to prove that the vertical composition of 2-tracks is well defined; see 1.3.3.\r
Lemma 51 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let f : S\r
2 → M be a smooth map.\r
Consider a handle decomposition H of M. Let Hibe the i-skeleton of H; in\r
other words Hiis the handlebody made from the handles of H of index less than\r
or equal to i, where i = 0, 1, . . . , dim(M). There exists an ambient isotopy of\r
M, sending H to a handle decomposition I of M, such that f(S\r
2\r
) ⊂ I\r
2\r
, the\r
2-skeleton of the handle decomposition I.\r
Proof. Let m = dim(M).\r
Let J be the handle decomposition of M which is dual to H. If m = 2 there\r
is nothing to prove. Otherwise f(S\r
2\r
) is a compact set with zero measure in M,\r
by Sard’s theorem; see [H]. Therefore, there exists an ambient isotopy of M,\r
sending J to a handle decomposition J0 of M, such that the 0-handles of J0\r
are contained in M \\ f(S\r
2\r
), a non-empty open set of M. If m = 3, taking the\r
dual handle decomposition of J0, yields a handle decomposition I of M with\r
f(S\r
2\r
) ⊂ I\r
2\r
.\r
Suppose that m > 3. Let {h\r
1\r
i\r
} be the set of handles of J0 of index 1. Then\r
each 1-handle h\r
1\r
i\r
is of the form h\r
1\r
i = D1i × D\r
m−1\r
i\r
, and attaches to the 0-skeleton\r
J\r
0\r
0\r
of J0 along S\r
0\r
i × D\r
m−1\r
i\r
. For each i, let p\r
1\r
i\r
: h\r
1\r
i → D\r
m−1\r
i\r
be the obvious\r
projection. Here Dm is the m-disk. Then p\r
1\r
i\r
can be extended to a smooth\r
map q\r
1\r
i\r
: V\r
1\r
i → R\r
m−1\r
, where V\r
1\r
i\r
is an open neighbourhood of h\r
1\r
i\r
in M. For\r
each i, let A1\r
i = f\r
−1\r
(V\r
1\r
i\r
) ⊂ S\r
2\r
. It is an open set in S\r
2\r
. Since m − 1 > 2,\r
the set (q\r
1\r
i\r
◦ f)(A1\r
i\r
) ⊂ R\r
m−1 has measure zero, for q1\r
i\r
is smooth. Therefore\r
p\r
1\r
i\r
(f(S\r
2\r
)) ⊂ (q\r
1\r
i\r
◦ f)(A1\r
i\r
) has measure zero in Dm−1\r
i\r
.\r
Choose an (m − 1)-ball c\r
m−1\r
i ⊂ D\r
m−1\r
i\r
, not intersecting p\r
1\r
i\r
(f(S\r
2\r
)); note that\r
p\r
1\r
i\r
(f(S\r
2\r
)) is compact. There exists an ambient isotopy of M, which restricts\r
to an ambient isotopy of J\r
0\r
0\r
(the 0-skeleton of J0), whilst sending each h\r
1\r
i =\r
D1\r
i ×D\r
m−1\r
i\r
to D1\r
i ×c\r
m−1\r
i\r
. Let J1 be the handle decomposition of M to which J0\r
is sent by the ambient isotopy. By construction J\r
1\r
1 ∩f(S\r
2\r
) = ∅. If dim(M) = 4,\r
43

taking the dual handle decomposition to J1, yields the handle decomposition I\r
of M, and by construction f(S\r
2\r
) ⊂ I\r
2\r
.\r
Suppose m > 4. The argument is the same. As above, let {h\r
2\r
i\r
} be the set\r
of 2-handles of J1. Then, for any i, h\r
2\r
i = D2i × D\r
m−2\r
i\r
, and h\r
2\r
i\r
attaches to J\r
1\r
1\r
along S\r
1\r
i × D\r
m−2\r
i\r
. For each i, let p\r
2\r
i\r
: h\r
2\r
i → D\r
m−2\r
i be the obvious projection.\r
As before, since m − 2 > 2, the set p\r
2\r
i\r
(f(S\r
2\r
)), which is compact, has zero\r
measure in Dm−2\r
i\r
. Therefore, there exists an (m − 2)-ball c\r
m−2\r
i ⊂ D\r
m−2\r
i\r
such\r
that p\r
2\r
i\r
(f(S\r
2\r
)) ∩ c\r
m−2\r
i = ∅. There exists an ambient isotopy of M, restricting\r
to an ambient isotopy of J\r
1\r
1\r
, and sending h\r
2\r
i = D2\r
i × D\r
m−2\r
i\r
to D2\r
i × c\r
m−2\r
i\r
, for\r
each i. Let the handle decomposition J2 be the image of J1 under the ambient\r
isotopy. As before, by construction, J\r
2\r
2 ∩ f(S\r
2\r
) = ∅. If m = 5, letting I be the\r
handle decomposition of M dual to J2, then we have that f(S\r
2\r
) ⊂ J\r
2\r
.\r
An obvious inductive argument will finish the proof for any m ∈ N.\r
Lemma 52 Let f : ∂(D3) → M be a smooth map such that Rank(Dvf) ≤\r
1, ∀v ∈ ∂(D3). Here D3 = [0, 1]3. Suppose that f is constant in a neighbourhood\r
of each vertex of ∂(D3). In addition, suppose also that in a neighbourhood\r
I × [−ǫ, ǫ] of each edge I of ∂(D3), f(x, t) = φ(x), where (x, t) ∈ I × [−ǫ, ǫ] and\r
φ: I → M is smooth. Then f can be extended to a smooth map F : D3 → M\r
such that Rank(DwF) ≤ 2, ∀w ∈ D3. Moreover we can choose F so that it has\r
a product structure close to the boundary of D3.\r
Proof. The conditions of the statement imply that f is of the form f\r
′ ◦ r,\r
where f\r
′\r
: S\r
2 → M is a smooth map and r : ∂(D3\r
) → S\r
2\r
is some smooth\r
homeomorphism.\r
By using the previous lemma, we can see that there exists a handle decom\u0002position of M such that f(∂(D3\r
)) is contained in the 2-skeleton M2 of M (the\r
handlebody made from the 0-,1- and 2-handles of M). Let us prove that we can\r
suppose further that f(∂(D3)) is contained in the 1-skeleton M1 of M. This\r
will be completely analogous (though dual) to the proof of the previous lemma.\r
Let n = dim(M). Suppose that n ≥ 2. Let {hi} be the set of 2-handles\r
of M. Therefore, for each i, hi = D2\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
, and hi attaches to M1 along\r
S\r
1\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i = (∂D2\r
i\r
) × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
. It suffices to prove that for each i there exists an\r
xi ∈ D2\r
i\r
(thus an open 2-ball) such that f(∂D3) does not intersect {xi} × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
.\r
Let pi: hi = D2\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i → D2 × {0} be the obvious projection. Given that\r
Rank(Dvf) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ ∂D3, it follows that Zi = pi(hi∩f(∂D3)) has zero measure\r
in D2, thus that we can choose an xiin the interior of D2 not intersecting Zi.\r
Therefore, some open ball in D2containing xi does not intersect Zi. This proves\r
that there exists a handle decomposition of M such that f(∂D3) is contained in\r
the interior of the 1-skeleton M1 of M, analogously to the proof of the previous\r
lemma.\r
Consider the universal cover N\r
p\r
−→ M1 of M1. It is a contractible smooth\r
manifold. We can lift f as f = p ◦ g\r
′\r
, where g\r
′\r
: ∂D3 → N is a smooth map,\r
such that Rank(Dvg\r
′\r
) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ ∂D3, since p is a local diffeomorphism. Let\r
c : N ×[0, 1] → N be a smooth contraction of N to a point of it. We can suppose\r
that there exists an ǫ > 0 such that c does not depend on t for t ∈ [0, ǫ]∪[1−ǫ, 1].\r
44

The smooth homotopy g(v, t) = p(c(g\r
′\r
(v), t)) where t ∈ [0, 1] and v ∈ ∂(D3) will\r
permit us to extend f : ∂(D3) → M to a smooth map F : D3 → M, with a\r
product structure close to the boundary of D3. By construction we also have\r
that Rank(DwF) ≤ 2, ∀w ∈ D3.\r

Abstract\r
We define the thin fundamental categorical group P2(M, ∗) of a based\r
smooth manifold (M, ∗) as the categorical group whose objects are rank-1\r
homotopy classes of based loops on M, and whose morphisms are rank\u00022 homotopy classes of homotopies between based loops on M. Here two\r
maps are rank-n homotopic, when the rank of the differential of the homo\u0002topy between them equals n. Let C(G) be a Lie categorical group coming\r
from a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). We construct categorical\r
holonomies, defined to be smooth morphisms P2(M, ∗) → C(G), by using\r
a notion of categorical connections, being a pair (ω, m), where ω is a con\u0002nection 1-form on P, a principal G bundle over M, and m is a 2-form on\r
P with values in the Lie algebra of E, with the pair (ω, m) satisfying suit\u0002able conditions. As a further result, we are able to define Wilson spheres\r
in this context.\r

Introduction\r
Categorification is an influential idea in many areas of mathematics, and in\r
geometry it is natural to try and think about categorifying the notions of holon\u0002omy and parallel transport in terms of higher categorical generalisations of the\r
notions of loop, Lie group and connection on a principal bundle, in the spirit\r
of Baez and Schreiber [B, BS]. In this article we construct a framework for\r
2-dimensional, or surface, holonomy along such lines. The based loops on a\r
manifold M are replaced by what we call the (strict) thin fundamental cate\u0002gorical group of M, P2(M, ∗), a monoidal category whose objects are rank-1\r
homotopy classes of based loops on M and whose morphisms are rank-2 ho\u0002motopy classes of homotopies between based loops (or 1-parameter families of\r
loops). Here, rank-1 homotopy, at the level of loops, means that the loops are\r
homotopic in such a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy be\u0002tween them is less than or equal to 1, i.e. the homotopies between loops do not\r
sweep out area. Similarly, at the level of morphisms, two homotopies between\r
based loops are rank-2 homotopic, if they themselves are homotopic in such\r
a way that the rank of the differential of the homotopy between them is less\r
than or equal to 2, i.e. the homotopy between homotopies does not sweep out\r
volume. For precise definitions, we refer to subsections 1.3.1 and 1.3.2. The Lie\r
group is replaced by a categorical Lie group, C(G), naturally obtained from a\r
crossed module of Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲). The connection on a princi\u0002pal G-bundle P over M is replaced by what we call a categorical connection,\r
consisting of a connection 1-form on P with values in g, the Lie algebra of G,\r
together with a 2-form on P with values in e, the Lie algebra of E, satisfying\r
some conditions including the well-known “vanishing of the fake curvature”.\r
Locally these conditions correspond to Baez and Schreiber’s [BS] local formu\u0002lation for a 2-connection. The Maurer-Cartan structure equation and Bianchi\r
identity for the curvature of an ordinary connection are shown to have natural\r
analogues for the curvature 3-form of the categorical connection. Also a variant\r
of the Ambrose-Singer theorem (which plays a crucial role in our construction\r
of categorical holonomy) generalises to a higher-order version.\r
A categorical holonomy is defined to be a (strict monoidal) smooth functor\r
from P2(M, ∗) to C(G). The main result that we prove (Thm. 39) is how a\r
categorical connection gives rise to a categorical holonomy. The underlying\r
geometrical idea is to lift the 1-parameter family of loops into P, horizontally in\r
one direction, namely the direction along the loops, and to use this lift to pull\r
back the forms of the categorical connection, which are then integrated suitably.\r
Note that the appearance of a principal G-bundle P with a connection is\r
natural in the context of categorical holonomies. This is because, at the level of\r
the set of objects of P2(M, ∗), i.e. π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗), the thin homotopy classes of based\r
loops on M, any smooth functor P2(M, ∗) → G gives rise to a smooth group\r
morphism π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G, and therefore it defines a principal G-bundle over M\r
3

with a connection [CP, MP].\r
The whole construction is carried out using the language and methods of dif\u0002ferential geometry and principal bundles, thereby avoiding working with infinite\u0002dimensional path spaces, which was an approach taken in [BS]. The construction\r
is coordinate-free from the outset, since we use forms defined on P. We remark\r
that the construction of P2(M, ∗) is of interest in its own right in defining a\r
strict thin fundamental categorical group of a manifold (previously only a weak\r
version was known). This part of our construction is very similar to that of\r
[BHKP, HKK].\r
We study the relation between our construction and non-abelian gerbes, as in\r
[BrMe], and 2-bundles, as in [BS], in 2.4.6. Note that each 2-bundle with struc\u0002ture 2-group coming from a crossed module of the form (Ad: G → Aut(G), ⊲),\r
where ⊲ denotes the obvious left action of Aut(G) in G, is naturally a non-abelian\r
gerbe. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Our construction cor\u0002responds to a particular case of G-2-bundles, for which the E-valued transition\r
functions are trivial, and therefore the G-valued transition functions satisfy the\r
usual cocycle condition for a principal G-bundle. Although G-2-bundles are\r
a natural way to approach two-dimensional holonomy, we emphasise that our\r
main goal is the definition of categorical group maps P2(M, ∗) → C(G). This is\r
a very strong condition, and we argue that it should force the G-2-bundle with\r
connection to be of the special form considered here - see 2.4.6 where this point\r
is elaborated.\r
At the end of this article we define the notion of Wilson sphere, which means\r
that a categorical holonomy, taking values in the kernel of ∂ : E → G, can be\r
associated to embedded spheres in a manifold, up to acting by an element of\r
the group G."""

Therefore, given a differential crossed module, G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) there exists\r
a unique crossed module of simply connected Lie groups G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
whose differential form is G, up to isomorphism. The proof of this result is\r
standard Lie theory, together with the lift of the Lie algebra action to a Lie\r
group action, which can be found in [K], Thm 1.102.\r
Example 5 Let G be a Lie group with a left action ⊲ on an abelian group V by\r
automorphisms, for example take V to be any representation of G on a vector\r
space. If we put ∂ = 1G then (∂ : V → G, ⊲) is a Lie crossed module. Its\r
differential form is given by the derived action of g on V and the zero map\r
V → g.\r
Example 6 Let G be any Lie group. Let Ad denote the adjoint action of G on\r
G. Then (id: G → G, Ad) is a Lie crossed module.\r
Example 7 Let G and E be Lie groups, and let ∂ : E → G be a surjective map\r
such that ker(∂) is central in E. Define a left action of G on E as g ⊲e = g0eg−1\r
0\r
,\r
where g0 ∈ E is such that ∂(g0) = g ∈ G, and e ∈ E. Then G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
is a Lie crossed module.\r
Example 8 In the previous example, we can take the universal covering map\r
SU(2) → SO(3), whose kernel is {±1}. The differential form of this crossed\r
module is given by the adjoint action of su(2) on su(2) and the identity map.\r
Example 9 More generally, take the universal cover ∂ : E → G of the Lie\r
group G. Then the construction in example 7 can be applied since the kernel of\r
∂ is necessarily central in E.\r
Example 10 Let H be the group of upper triangular matrices in R which only\r
have 1’s in the main diagonal. Define a Lie group map ∂ : H → R\r
2 as\r
∂\r
\r
\r
1 a b\r
0 1 c\r
0 0 1\r
\r
 = (a, c),\r
where a, b, c ∈ R. Then the kernel of ∂ : H → R\r
2\r
is central in H, and therefore\r
the construction in example 7 can be applied.\r
Example 11 Let E be any Lie group. Let Aut(E) be the group of automor\u0002phisms of E. Then Aut(E) is a Lie group, in fact it is a Lie subgroup of GL(e) if\r
E is simply connected. Consider the map Ad: E → Aut(E) that sends e ∈ E to\r
the automorphism Ad(e): E → E. The group Aut(E) acts on E as φ ⊲ e = φ(e)\r
where φ ∈ Aut(E) and e ∈ E. Then (Ad: E → Aut(E), ⊲) is a Lie crossed\r
module.\r
The previous construction yields several examples of Lie crossed modules. For\r
instance, example 8 is obtained this way since Aut(SU(2)) = SO(3). To get new\r
examples, however, we need to consider non-semisimple Lie groups."""

Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a crossed module. The set of objects C0 of C(G)\r

Let M be a smooth manifold.\r
1.3.1 1-Tracks\r
Definition 15 (1-path) A 1-path is given by a smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M\r
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 such that γ is constant in [0, ǫ] ∪ [1 − ǫ, 1]; in\r
the terminology of [CP], this can be abbreviated by saying that each end point of\r
γ has a sitting instant. Given a 1-path γ, define the source and target of γ as\r
σ(γ) = γ(0) and τ(γ) = γ(1), respectively.\r
Given two 1-paths γ and φ with τ(γ) = σ(φ), their concatenation γφ is\r
defined in the usual way:\r
(γφ)(t) = (\r
γ(2t), if t ∈ [0, 1/2]\r
φ(2t − 1), if t ∈ [1/2, 1]\r
Note that the concatenation of two 1-paths is also a 1-path. The fact that any\r
1-path has sitting instants at its end points needs to be used to prove this.\r
Definition 16 (2-paths) A 2-path Γ is given by a smooth map Γ: [0, 1]2 → M\r
such that there exists an ǫ > 0 for which:\r
1. Γ(t, s) = Γ(0, 0) if 0 ≤ t ≤ ǫ and s ∈ [0, 1],\r
2. Γ(t, s) = Γ(1, 0) if 1 − ǫ ≤ t ≤ 1 and s ∈ [0, 1],\r
3. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 0) if 0 ≤ s ≤ ǫ and t ∈ [0, 1],\r
4. Γ(t, s) = Γ(t, 1) if 1 − ǫ ≤ s ≤ 1 and t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Given a 2-path Γ, define the following 1-paths:\r
∂l(Γ)(s) = Γ(0, s), s ∈ [0, 1], ∂r(Γ)(s) = Γ(1, s), s ∈ [0, 1],\r
∂d(Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 0), t ∈ [0, 1], ∂u(Γ)(t) = Γ(t, 1), t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Note that the paths ∂l(Γ) and ∂r(Γ) are necessarily constant, thus each of them\r
can be identified with a point of M. In addition, given a 2-path Γ then the\r
1-paths ∂u(Γ) and ∂d(Γ) have the same initial and end points. If x is a point of\r
M the constant 1- and 2-paths with value x are both denoted by x.\r
If Γ and Γ′ are 2-paths such that ∂r(Γ) = ∂l(Γ′) their horizontal concatena\u0002tion Γ ◦h Γ\r

Γ\r

(2t − 1, s), if t ∈ [1/2, 1] and s ∈ [0, 1]\r

′ as:\r
\r
Γ ◦v Γ\r

\u0001\r
(t, s) = (\r
Γ(t, 2s), if s ∈ [0, 1/2] and t ∈ [0, 1]\r
Γ\r

(t, 2s − 1), if s ∈ [1/2, 1] and t ∈ [0, 1]\r

Γ =\r
∂u(Γ)\r

Γ\r

The aim of this subsection is to prove the following main theorem.\r
Theorem 39 Let G be a Lie group. Let M be a smooth manifold. Let also P →\r
M be a smooth principal fibre bundle with structure group G. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲)\r
be a Lie crossed module. A G-categorical connection (ω, m) on P together with\r

F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G), which we call a categorical connection holonomy,\r
since it arises from a categorical connection.\r
For the rest of this subsection, fix a Lie crossed module G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲),\r
and let G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲) be the associated differential crossed module. Consider\r
also a smooth manifold M and a principal G-bundle P over M, as well as a G\u0002categorical connection (ω, m) on P."""

[0, 1], depends only on the rank-2 homotopy class to which Γ belongs, and defines\r
a monoidal functor P2(M, ∗) → C(G), such that the induced maps on the set of\r
objects and morphisms of P2(M, ∗) are smooth.\r
First of all:\r
Lemma 40 Let Γ be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. Then for each\r
s ∈ [0, 1] we have: gγ0 ∂(eΓ(s)) = gγs. Here Γ(t, s) = γs(t); ∀s, t ∈ [0, 1].\r
Proof. The previous equation holds for s = 0, by definition of eΓ(s). We have:\r
d\r
ds\r
\r
gγ0 ∂(eΓ(s))\u0001= gγ0\r
d\r
ds∂ (eΓ(s)) = gγ0 ∂\r
\u0012\r
d\r

\u0013\r

therefore:\r

since ∂(m) = Ω. By equation (7) we also have:\r

.\r
Thus both sides of the equation are solutions of the same differential equation\r
in G, and have the same initial condition.\r
We remark that, using the terminology of [BS], this result corresponds to\r
the condition that a local pre-2-holonomy gives rise to a local true 2-holonomy,\r
which there also follows from the vanishing of the fake curvature.\r
Let Γ: [0, 1]2 → M be a 2-path in M with ∂l(Γ) = ∂r(Γ) = ∗. We need\r
to prove that F\r
2\r
(ω,m,u)\r
(Γ) depends only on the 2-track defined by Γ, in other\r
words on the rank-2 homotopy class of 2-paths to which Γ belongs. This will\r
be shown shortly in Corollary 43 of Theorem 42. For now, consider a 3-path J,\r
where J(t, s, x) = Γx(t, s); ∀t, s, x ∈ [0, 1], defining a homotopy (not necessarily\r
rank-2) connecting the 2-paths Γ0 and Γ1. Suppose that ∂l(Γ0), ∂r(Γ0) = ∗,\r
thus ∂l(Γ1), ∂r(Γ1) = ∗. We want to calculate ∂\r
∂xeΓx (s), where s, x ∈ [0, 1].\r
In fact, for later applications, we will consider the more general case when,\r
for each x ∈ [0, 1], we have that ∂l(Γx) = q(x) and ∂r(Γx) = q(x), where\r
q : [0, 1] → M is a smooth map. This generality will be important to define\r
Wilson spheres in 2.5.3. The lemma in the following subsection will be useful\r
for our purpose.\r

well-known formula (21). Finally, the last equation follows since (∂ : e → g, ⊲)\r
is a differential crossed module.\r
By lemma 40, we also have that gγ\r

Theorem 42 Let M be a smooth manifold. Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie\r

We have therefore proven that F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G) is a monoidal\r
functor, and therefore a categorical group map.\r
Claim: The functor F(ω,m,u): P2(M, ∗) → C(G) is smooth both on the sets\r
π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) and P2(M, ∗) of objects and morphisms of P2(M, ∗).\r
Proof. This follows directly from the definition of F(ω,m,u), and from the\r
lemma on page 74 of [KN].\r
The proof of theorem 39 is complete.\r
2.4.6 2-Bundles\r
Let G = (∂ : E → G, ⊲) be a Lie crossed module. Let the associated differential\r
crossed module be G = (∂ : e → g, ⊲). Fix a smooth manifold M and a smooth\r
principal G-bundle π: P → M.\r
A natural weakening of the notion of a categorical connection (ω, m) in P is\r
to consider m to be only locally defined on P, but so that ∂(mi) = Ω, for any\r
i. Here mi ∈ A2(Pi, e), where Pi = π\r
−1\r
(Ui) and {Ui} is an open cover of P.\r
This can be done by using the general theory of 2-bundles [BS], or non-abelian\r
gerbes [BrMe], which correspond to 2-bundles with structure crossed modules\r
of the form G = Aut(E) of example 11.\r
To this end, let {Ui} be an open cover of M. We can suppose that, for any\r
i1, . . . , in, the n-fold intersection Ui1,...,in\r
.= Ui1 ∩ . . . ∩ Uin\r
is contractible. A G\u00022-bundle can be described by using smooth maps gij : Uij → G and hijk : Uijk →\r
E. These have to satisfy the cocycle conditions: ∂(h\r
−1\r
ijk)gijgjk = gik and hijkhikl =\r
(gij ⊲ hjkl) hijl for any i, j, k, l. Therefore a G-2-bundle does not necessarily de\u0002fine a G-principal bundle, unless ∂(hijk) = 1 for each i, j, k. If this condition is\r
satisfied, a G-2-bundle will be called a special G-2-bundle.\r
The main purpose of this article was the construction of categorical holonomies,\r
in other words of smooth categorical group maps P2(M, ∗) → C(G), or, equiva\u0002lently of smooth crossed module maps Π2,1\r
2\r
(M, ∗) → G; see 1.3 for this notation.\r
From the point of view of 2-dimensional holonomy, G-2-bundles are natural ob\u0002jects; see [BS]. However, our notion of categorical holonomy requires the exis\u0002tence of a smooth group morphism π\r
1\r
1\r
(M, ∗) → G, and therefore of a principal\r
G-bundle with connection; see [CP]. This makes it natural to work with special\r
G-2-bundles.\r
A special G-2-bundle with connection can be specified by the following data:\r
(Here A = ker(∂) ⊂ E, and a is its Lie algebra; note that A is central in E)."""

a principal G-bundle. Note that the Baez-Schreiber local differential forms can\r
be seen as a generalisation to arbitrary G of the local description of non-abelian\r
gerbes, with G = Aut(E), of Breen and Messing [BrMe].\r
Special G-2-bundles with connection define group morphisms π\r

(M, ∗) → G.\r
However, the definition of the categorical holonomy on a 2-track [Γ] ∈ P2(M, ∗)\r
is tricky if one is to deal with the fact that m is not globally defined. This can be\r
done (and will appear in a future work), however, it will only be, a priori, defined\r
up to multiplication by central elements of E, and thus it should not define\r
holonomies P2(M, ∗) → C(G), unless we restrict to elements of π\r
2\r
2\r
(M, ∗), as in\r
[MP]. For instance, it is easy to see that given two categorical G-connections\r

Lemma 52 Let f : ∂(D3) → M be a smooth map such that Rank(Dvf) ≤\r
1, ∀v ∈ ∂(D3). Here D3 = [0, 1]3. Suppose that f is constant in a neighbourhood\r
of each vertex of ∂(D3). In addition, suppose also that in a neighbourhood\r
I × [−ǫ, ǫ] of each edge I of ∂(D3), f(x, t) = φ(x), where (x, t) ∈ I × [−ǫ, ǫ] and\r
φ: I → M is smooth. Then f can be extended to a smooth map F : D3 → M\r
such that Rank(DwF) ≤ 2, ∀w ∈ D3. Moreover we can choose F so that it has\r
a product structure close to the boundary of D3.\r
Proof. The conditions of the statement imply that f is of the form f\r
′ ◦ r,\r
where f\r
′\r
: S\r
2 → M is a smooth map and r : ∂(D3\r
) → S\r
2\r
is some smooth\r
homeomorphism.\r
By using the previous lemma, we can see that there exists a handle decom\u0002position of M such that f(∂(D3\r
)) is contained in the 2-skeleton M2 of M (the\r
handlebody made from the 0-,1- and 2-handles of M). Let us prove that we can\r
suppose further that f(∂(D3)) is contained in the 1-skeleton M1 of M. This\r
will be completely analogous (though dual) to the proof of the previous lemma.\r
Let n = dim(M). Suppose that n ≥ 2. Let {hi} be the set of 2-handles\r
of M. Therefore, for each i, hi = D2\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
, and hi attaches to M1 along\r
S\r
1\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i = (∂D2\r
i\r
) × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
. It suffices to prove that for each i there exists an\r
xi ∈ D2\r
i\r
(thus an open 2-ball) such that f(∂D3) does not intersect {xi} × D\r
n−2\r
i\r
.\r
Let pi: hi = D2\r
i × D\r
n−2\r
i → D2 × {0} be the obvious projection. Given that\r
Rank(Dvf) ≤ 1, ∀v ∈ ∂D3, it follows that Zi = pi(hi∩f(∂D3)) has zero measure\r
in D2, thus that we can choose an xiin the interior of D2 not intersecting Zi.\r
Therefore, some open ball in D2containing xi does not intersect Zi. This proves\r
that there exists a handle decomposition of M such that f(∂D3) is contained in\r
the interior of the 1-skeleton M1 of M, analogously to the proof of the previous\r
lemma.\r
Consider the universal cover N\r
p\r

′\r

such that Rank(Dvg\r

c : N ×[0, 1] → N be a smooth contraction of N to a point of it. We can suppose\r
