A link between the semiclassical Einstein equation and a maximal vacuum entanglement hypothesis is estab\u0002lished. The hypothesis asserts that entanglement entropy in small geodesic balls is maximized at fixed volume in\r
a locally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields. A qualitative argument suggests\r
that the Einstein equation implies validity of the hypothesis. A more precise argument shows that, for first-order\r
variations of the local vacuum state of conformal quantum fields, the vacuum entanglement is stationary if and\r
only if the Einstein equation holds. For nonconformal fields, the same conclusion follows modulo a conjecture\r
about the variation of entanglement entropy.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
When restricted to one side of a spatial partition, the vac\u0002uum state of a quantum field has entropy because the two sides\r
are entangled. The entanglement entropy of the restricted state\r
is dominated by the ultraviolet (UV) field degrees of freedom\r
near the interface, and hence scales with the area. This is sim\u0002ilar to the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy, A/4L\r
2\r
p\r
,\r
where A is the horizon area and Lp = (~G/c3)\r
1/2\r
is the\r
Planck length [1–3]. The similarity of these two “area laws” is\r
striking, and has led to the idea that black hole entropy is just a\r
special case of vacuum entanglement entropy [4–9]. To match\r
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, vacuum entanglement en\u0002tropy should be cut off at the Planck scale. Considering the\r
gravitational backreaction of vacuum fluctuations, such a cut\u0002off appears natural [7, 10], but it lies deep in the regime of\r
poorly understood quantum gravity effects.\r
Bekenstein defined the generalized entropy Sgen as the sum\r
of the horizon entropy and the ordinary entropy in the exterior.\r
If the horizon entropy is indeed entanglement entropy, then\r
the (fine-grained) generalized entropy is nothing but the total\r
von Neumann entropy of the quantum state outside the hori\u0002zon [9, 11, 12]. Bekenstein proposed the generalized second\r
law (GSL) stating that Sgen never decreases [2]. The GSL has\r
been shown to hold in various regimes [13], the proofs having\r
been recently strengthened to apply to rapid changes and arbi\u0002trary horizon slices [14, 15]. The validity of the law depends\r
on the Einstein equation, which relates the curvature — and\r
therefore the focusing of light rays that determines the change\r
of horizon area — to the local energy-momentum density of\r
matter.\r
The GSL thus points to a deep link between vacuum entan\u0002glement and the Einstein equation. The aim of this paper is to\r
better understand the nature of this link. Motivated by the no\u0002tion of vacuum as an equilibrium state, I formulate a maximal\r
vacuum entanglement hypothesis (MVEH):\r
When the geometry and quantum fields are si\u0002multaneously varied from maximal symmetry, the\r
entanglement entropy in a small geodesic ball is\r
maximal at fixed volume.\r
∗ jacobson@umd.edu\r
This is formulated in the context of semiclassical gravity, i.e.\r
quantum fields on a classical spacetime. As such, it is predi\u0002cated on the following assumption:\r
The area density of vacuum entanglement entropy\r
η is finite and universal.\r
This assumption is supported by the evidence that horizon en\u0002tropy can indeed be identified with entanglement entropy (see,\r
e.g. [9, 16, 17], and references therein). However, it involves\r
UV aspects of quantum gravity that are not currently under\u0002stood, so it remains an assumption.\r
I will argue that the Einstein equation supports the MVEH\r
and, conversely, that the MVEH implies the Einstein equation\r
for first-order variations of the local vacuum state for confor\u0002mal fields. For nonconformal fields the result holds modulo a\r
conjecture about the variation of entanglement entropy to be\r
explained below. It is well known that diffeomorphism invari\u0002ance selects the Einstein equation, at second order in deriva\u0002tives, as the unique gravitational field equation in a metric\r
theory. Since the MVEH is formulated in a diffeomorphism\u0002invariant fashion, it is therefore not surprising that the Ein\u0002stein equation would arise. Nevertheless, entropy maximiza\u0002tion is quite different from Hamilton’s principle of stationary\r
action, so something new is learned here. Moreover, the New\u0002ton constant that appears in the derived Einstein equation—\r
which is not fixed by diffeomorphism invariance—has pre\u0002cisely the value required in order for η to correspond to the\r
Bekenstein-Hawking value, 1/4~G. This is a nontrivial and\r
essential consistency property of the derivation.\r
Two lines of evidence motivated this paper. First, the Ein\u0002stein equation can be derived as a thermodynamic equation\r
of state of the vacuum outside a local causal horizon [18].\r
That derivation assumes that the entropy change of an other\u0002wise stationary horizon is given by δQ/T when a local boost\r
energy δQ crosses the horizon, T = ~/2π being the Unruh\r
temperature. Second, recent work invokes AdS/CFT (anti-de\r
Sitter/conformal field theory) duality, and the thermal nature\r
of CFT vacuum entanglement entropy, to derive the linearized\r
Einstein equation for perturbations of AdS spacetime [19–21].\r
This approach treats the entropy statistically, rather than ther\u0002modynamically, and it concerns entropy of a compact region\r
in the CFT at one time, rather than following the change of\r
horizon entropy. The present work combines the local space\u0002time setting of the equation of state approach, with the statisti\u0002arXiv:1505.04753v4 [gr-qc] 25 Jun 2016

2\r
cal, compact region setting of the holographic analysis, but it\r
proceeds directly in spacetime, making no use of holography.\r
II. AREA DEFICIT AND GENERAL RELATIVITY\r
Einstein’s field equation,\r
Gab = 8πG Tab, (1)\r
relates the Einstein curvature tensor Gab to the energy\u0002momentum tensor of matter, Tab. Central to our story is the\r
equivalence of (1) to the statement that the surface area deficit\r
of any small, spacelike geodesic ball of fixed volume is pro\u0002portional to the energy density in the ball.1 We begin by\r
demonstrating this lovely relation.\r
At any point o in a spacetime of dimension d, choose an\r
arbitrary timelike unit vector u\r
a\r
, and generate a (d − 1)-\r
dimensional spacelike ball Σ by sending out geodesics of\r
length ` from o in all directions orthogonal to u\r
a\r
. The point\r
o is the center of the ball, and the boundary ∂Σ is the surface\r
(see the grey region of Fig. 1). Choose a Riemann normal co\u0002ordinate (RNC) system based at o, launched from an orthonor\u0002mal basis formed by u\r
a\r
and d − 1 spacelike vectors tangent\r
to Σ. Let the timelike coordinate be x\r
0\r
, and let the spacelike\r
ones be {x\r
i}. The signature of the spacetime metric is taken\r
here to be (−+++), and units are chosen with c = 1.\r
We will assume the radius of the ball is much smaller than\r
the local curvature length,\r
` \u001C Lcurvature (2)\r
and work to lowest nontrivial order in their ratio. The volume\r
variation at fixed radius, relative to flat space, is then given by\r
δV |` = −\r
Ωd−2`\r
d+1\r
6(d − 1)(d + 1)R, (3)\r
where R = Rik\r
ik is the spatial Ricci scalar at o (see Ap\u0002pendix A for details), and the area variation of ∂Σ is given by\r
dδV /d`, i.e.\r
δA|` = −\r
Ωd−2`\r
d\r
6(d − 1)R. (4)\r
We will also be interested in the area variation at fixed vol\u0002ume, rather than at fixed geodesic radius. When the radius\r
of the ball varies, the volume and area variations have the\r
additional contributions δrV = `\r
d−2\r
R\r
δr dΩ and δrA =\r
(d − 2)`\r
d−3\r
R\r
δr dΩ. Choosing Rδr dΩ so that the total vol\u0002ume variation vanishes, we obtain the area variation at fixed\r
volume,\r
δA|V = δA −\r

FIG. 1. Causal diamond, in a maximally symmetric spacetime, for\r
a geodesic ball Σ of radius ` with center o and boundary ∂Σ. The\r
dashed curves are flow lines of ζ, the conformal Killing vector field,\r
whose flow preserves the diamond and which vanishes at the top and\r
bottom vertices and on ∂Σ. The vectors show ζ at four points of Σ.\r
This is smaller by the factor 3/(d + 1) than the variation at\r
fixed radius (4).\r
To connect now with spacetime and the Einstein equation,\r
note that the spatial Ricci scalar at o is equal to twice the RNC\r
00-component of the spacetime Einstein tensor:\r
R = Rik\r
ik = R − 2R00 = 2(R00 −\r
1\r
2Rg00) = 2G00. (6)\r
The area deficit (5) can thus also be expressed as\r
δA|V = −\r
Ωd−2`\r

Then, using the Einstein equation (1), we see that the area\r
deficit is proportional to the energy density,\r
δA|V = −\r

Conversely, this simple geometrical relation contains the full\r
content of Einstein’s equation, if it holds at all spacetime\r
points and for all timelike unit vectors.\r
The evidence that the Einstein equation implies maximal\r
vacuum entanglement can now be stated in a qualitative, in\u0002tuitive fashion. Suppose the ball has a Bekenstein-Hawking\r
entropy A/4~G, arising from vacuum entanglement, and we\r
try to increase the entropy by placing an entangled qbit in the\r
ball. To localize the qbit within a region of size ` we must\r
give it an energy of at least ~/` which, according to (8), will\r
contribute an area deficit of order ~G, hence a surface entropy\r
decrease of order unity, offsetting the added qbit. It would\r
not help to use a “highly entropic object” with many internal\r
states, because the existence of such objects makes its mark in\r
the vacuum as well, diluting the entropic effect of adding the\r
object to the ball. Indeed, in the context of the Rindler wedge,\r
it was argued that δS ≤ δE/T, where T is the Unruh temper\u0002ature ~/2π and δE is the change of boost Killing energy, since

3\r
a thermal state maximizes entropy at fixed energy [22, 23]. We\r
now proceed to make this link between the Einstein equation\r
and maximal vacuum entanglement more precise.\r
III. CAUSAL DIAMOND AND CONFORMAL ISOMETRY\r
To evaluate the variation of the entanglement entropy in a\r
spacelike geodesic ball Σ it is helpful to consider the space\u0002time region causally determined by Σ, called the causal di\u0002amond D(Σ). In a maximally symmetric spacetime, D(Σ)\r
is the intersection of the future of a past vertex and the past\r
of a future vertex, and has a conformal isometry and rota\u0002tional symmetry in the rest frame defined by these vertices\r
(see Fig. 1).\r
The Minkowski line element ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r\r
2dΩ2\r
takes the form ds2 = −du dv + r\r
2dΩ2 with null coordinates\r
u = t−r and v = t+r. The Minkowski diamond centered on\r
the origin consists of the intersection of the regions u > −`\r
and v < `. The unique conformal isometry that preserves the\r
diamond, and is spherically symmetric, is generated by the\r
conformal Killing vector\r
ζ =\r

(for a derivation see Appendix B). Expressed in t and r coor\u0002dinates, ζ is given by\r

. (10)\r
The Lie derivative of the Minkowski metric along ζ is\r
Lζ ηab = −(2t/`) ηab. (11)\r
The vector ζ is tangent to the null generators on the past and\r
future null boundaries of the diamond, so those boundaries\r
are conformal Killing horizons [24]. They meet at the ball\r
boundary ∂Σ, where ζ vanishes, so ∂Σ is a bifurcation sur\u0002face. The surface gravity κ of a conformal Killing horizon is\r
well-defined by the equation ∇aζ\r
2 = −2κζa [25], and with\r
the normalization of ζ in (9) it is equal to unity.\r
IV. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY OF A DIAMOND\r
The entanglement entropy in a diamond D(Σ) is the same\r
as that in Σ. Under a simultaneous variation of the geome\u0002try and the state of the quantum fields, (δgab, δ|ψi), the dia\u0002mond entanglement entropy variation will consist of two con\u0002tributions, a state-independent UV part δSUV from the area\r
change induced by δgab, and a state-dependent IR part δSIR\r
from δ|ψi.\r
As mentioned above, we are assuming that, as a result of\r
the UV physics, the entanglement entropy in a spatial region\r
is finite in any state, with a leading term ηA. Here A is the\r
area of the boundary of the region and η is a universal con\u0002stant with dimensions [length]2−d\r
. The scaling with area is\r
natural in any theory with a large density of states at short\r
distances. The assumption that η is universal is motivated by\r
the idea that the UV structure of the vacuum is common to all\r
states in the class being considered.2 Under this assumption,\r
when the geometry is varied, the contribution to the entangle\u0002ment entropy in Σ from the UV degrees of freedom near the\r
boundary ∂Σ changes by an amount\r
δSUV = η δA. (12)\r
The total entropy variation will thus be given by\r
δStot = η δA + δSIR (13)\r
If η = 1/4~G, (12) coincides with the variation of Beken\u0002stein’s generalized entropy, here interpreted as simply the to\u0002tal entropy in the diamond. The MVEH implies that the total\r
entropy variation (13) is zero at first order , and negative for\r
finite variations, when comparing to a maximally symmetric\r
spacetime with the volume of Σ held fixed.\r
To motivate this equilibrium condition, we first recall\r
that, for ordinary thermodynamic systems in equilibrium, the\r
Helmholtz free energy F = E − T S is minimized at fixed\r
volume. The MVEH is analogous, but with the additional fea\u0002ture that the energy vanishes. That the free energy of a di\u0002amond has no energy term can be motivated by comparison\r
with de Sitter spacetime, and the restriction to fixed volume\r
arises from the fact that the diamond has a conformal Killing\r
vector rather than a true Killing vector (see Appendices C and\r
D).\r
Our next step is to evaluate δSIR. The vacuum state of any\r
QFT, restricted to the diamond, can be expressed (formally)\r
as a thermal density matrix,\r
ρ = Z\r
−1\r
exp(−K/T), T = ~/2π, (14)\r
where K is the “modular Hamiltonian”. The temperature\r
T = ~/2π is factored out here so that K will be the gener\u0002ator of Lorentz boosts, i.e. hyperbolic angle shifts, at the edge\r
of the diamond. For an infinite diamond that coincides with\r
the Rindler wedge in Minkowski space, T is the Unruh tem\u0002perature [27, 28].\r
Because ρ in (14) has the form of a thermal state, it mini\u0002mizes the modular free energy,\r
FK = hKi − T S, (15)\r
where the brackets denote quantum expectation value, and\r
S = − Tr ρ ln ρ is the von Neumann entropy. The variation\r
δFK must therefore vanish for any small variation δρ of the\r
state, i.e.\r
δS =\r
2π\r
~\r
δhKi. (16)\r
2 This involves an implicit choice of “conformal frame” [26] for the metric,\r
namely, the one for which η is constant in spacetime. This metric turns\r
out to satisfy the Einstein equation, so this frame is the so-called “Einstein\r
frame”.

4\r
This is just the usual Clausius relation for a “thermal” state\r
(14).\r
In general K in (14) is not a local operator, and does not\r
generate a geometric flow. For a CFT, however, K is equal\r
to Hζ , the Hamiltonian generating the flow of the conformal\r
boost Killing vector (9) [29]. (This result is conformally re\u0002lated to the better-known version that holds for any Poincare´\r
invariant QFT restricted to the Rindler wedge [30].) That is,\r
Hζ is given by the integral\r
Hζ =\r
Z\r
Σ\r
T\r
abζb dΣa. (17)\r
If the quantum field state is varied away from the vacuum,\r
with an excitation length scale much longer than the diamond\r
size,\r
` \u001C Lexcitation, (18)\r
then hTabi can be treated as constant, and using the Killing\r
field (9) we find\r
δhHζ i =\r
Ωd−2`\r
d\r
d\r
2 − 1\r
δhT00i. (19)\r
If the matter field is not conformal, K is not given by (17),\r
and we cannot directly use (D2). However, suppose that the\r
matter is described by a QFT with a UV fixed point, so it is\r
asymptotically conformal at short distances, and that, in ad\u0002dition to (18), the diamond is much smaller than any length\r
scale in the QFT,\r
` \u001C LQFT. (20)\r
Then we conjecture—and we shall assume—that δhKi has the\r
form of (D2) with an additional term δX that is a spacetime\r
scalar,\r
δhKi =\r
Ωd−2`\r
d\r
d\r
2 − 1\r
\r
δhT00i + δX\u0001. (21)\r
(The common coefficient is factored out to simplify later ex\u0002pressions.) Calculations [31, 32] indicate that for a class of\r
theories and states, this is the case, although in general δX\r
may carry ` dependence and can dominate at small `.\r
3 Note\r
that the relation (21) refers only to the expectation value, and\r
only to lowest order in the radius of the ball.\r
V. EQUILIBRIUM AND THE EINSTEIN EQUATION\r
We now postulate that a small diamond is in equilibrium\r
if the quantum fields are in their vacuum state, and the cur\u0002vature is that of a maximally symmetric spacetime (MSS)\r
(Minkowski or (anti)-de Sitter). Any MSS seems an equally\r
3\r
In a previous draft of this paper, I had conjectured that X = − 1\r
d\r
hTi, so\r
that what appeared in δhKi would be just the tracefree part of hTabi.\r
good candidate, so we will regard the curvature scale of the\r
MSS as a local state parameter that is effectively constant in a\r
small diamond but may depend on the diamond.\r
The Einstein tensor in a MSS is GMSS\r
ab = −λgab, with λ\r
a curvature scale. When the metric is varied away from the\r
MSS, the area variation at fixed volume is obtained to lowest\r
order in curvature by replacing G00 in (5) with G00 − GMSS\r
00 ,\r
which yields\r
δA|V,λ = −\r
Ωd−2`\r
d\r
d\r
2 − 1\r
(G00 + λg00). (22)\r
The variation of the total diamond entropy (13) away from the\r
equilibrium can now be written using (22), (16) , and (21):\r
δStot|V,λ = η δA|V,λ +\r
2π\r
~\r
δhKi =\r
Ωd−2`\r

−η (G00 + λg00) + 2π\r
~\r
\r
δhT00i + δX\u0001\r
\u0015\r
. (23)\r
The Einstein tensor should presumably be understood here as\r
a quantum expectation value hGabi, since the entropy that is\r
maximized is, by definition, an expectation value. In using\r
(21) for the matter entanglement variation, we are neglecting\r
corrections that would come from the curvature of the MSS,\r
since those would be of higher order.\r
The requirement that the variation (23) vanishes at all\r
points and with all timelike unit vectors implies a tensor equa\u0002tion,\r
Gab + λ gab =\r
2π\r
~η\r
\r
δhTabi + δXgab\u0001. (24)\r
The divergence of this equation, together with the Bianchi\r
identity and local conservation of energy, ties λ to δX via\r
λ =\r
2π\r
~η\r
δX + Λ, (25)\r
where Λ is a spacetime constant. Had we not allowed for the\r
MSS curvature scale λ in the equilibrium state, (25) would\r
have implied the unphysical restriction that the scalar term\r
δX be constant. Note also that if δX has `-dependence then\r
so does λ.\r
When (25) is substituted back into (24) we arrive at\r
Gab + Λgab =\r
2π\r
~η\r
δhTabi. (26)\r
This is Einstein’s equation with an undetermined cosmologi\u0002cal constant Λ, which evidently must be independent of `, and\r
with Newton’s constant defined by\r
G =\r
1\r
4~η\r
. (27)\r
The area density of entanglement entropy η and Planck’s\r
constant thus determine the gravitational coupling strength.\r
Stronger vacuum entanglement implies weaker gravity, i.e.\r
greater spacetime rigidity. Note the crucial consistency:\r
When expressed using G, the surface entropy ηA is the\r
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy A/4~G. The coefficient would\r
have been off by the factor (d + 1)/3 had we used the area\r
variation at fixed radius (4) rather than at fixed volume (5).

VI. DISCUSSION\r
We have shown, given our assumptions, that the semiclas\u0002sical Einstein equation holds, for first-order variations of the\r
vacuum, if and only if the entropy in small causal diamonds is\r
stationary at constant volume, when varied from a maximally\r
symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields. We\r
assumed the diamond size ` is much smaller than the local\r
curvature length, the wavelength of any excitations of the vac\u0002uum, and the scales in the matter field theory, but much larger\r
than the UV scale at which quantum gravity effects become\r
strong. Our entanglement variation assumption for noncon\u0002formal matter (21) concerns only standard QFT, and is either\r
true or false.\r
Strictly speaking the “first-order variation” refers to the\r
derivative with respect to a parameter labeling the state, evalu\u0002ated at the vacuum. To be physically applicable, however, the\r
result should apply to finite but small variations. The example\r
of a coherent state reveals a challenge in this regard [33]: Such\r
a state can have nonzero energy density while leaving entan\u0002glement entropy unchanged [34, 35]. That is, not all energy\r
registers as a change of entanglement. This is consistent with\r
the hypothesis of maximal vacuum entanglement, although\r
the Einstein equation implies that the entropy has decreased\r
— relative to vacuum — by more than it needs to in order to\r
satisfy the hypothesis. Unless a further consequence of that\r
hypothesis is found, or the hypothesis is refined and strength\u0002ened in some way, the Einstein equation does not appear to\r
follow from it in all generality.\r
We close with some questions and remarks concerning the\r
derivation and its implications.\r
• Do graviton fluctuations contribute to the entanglement\r
entropy? The UV part of the entanglement entropy\r
S = ηA is inscrutable at this level, and the IR part does\r
not include gravitons. Since the diamond is taken much\r
smaller than the wavelength of any ambient gravitons,\r
they have no gauge-invariant meaning in the diamond.\r
In the RNC gauge they are absent at first derivative or\u0002der. Moreover, the full, nonlinear Einstein tensor al\u0002ready appears on the geometric side of the equation, so\r
it would be double counting to include any graviton en\u0002ergy.\r
• Can a gravitational field equation with higher curvature\r
corrections be derived along these lines? Maybe. We\r
neglected terms of order `/Lcurv in the geometry cal\u0002culations, whereas a next-higher-curvature correction to\r
the field equation might be of order (`1/Lcurv)\r
2\r
, where\r
`\r
2\r
1\r
is the relative coefficient of the curvature squared\r
term in the action. To capture this within our approxi\u0002mation would require `/`1 < `1/Lcurv. The right-hand\r
side is presumably less than unity, in order for higher\u0002curvature terms to not dominate, so the diamond would\r
have to be taken smaller than `1. If, say, `1 were the\r
string length, would classical geometry and quantum\r
field theory apply at that scale? Probably not. On the\r
other hand, perhaps with improved accuracy of the ge\u0002ometric analysis, and the inclusion of subleading UV\r
terms in the entanglement entropy, one could consis\u0002tently capture higher-curvature corrections using a dia\u0002mond larger than `1.\r
• A derivation of Einstein’s equation invoking a quan\u0002tum limit to measurements of the spacetime geometry\r
of small causal diamonds was given in Ref. [36]. How\r
are the assumptions used there related to those made\r
here?\r
• According to our derivation the Einstein equation is a\r
property of vacuum equilibrium. Does this suggest how\r
to include nonequilibrium effects?\r

In the main text, the relation (A5) is used to find the area\r

the Einstein equation is made using the relation R = 2G00,\r
where Gab is the Einstein tensor. The viewpoint here is not\r
new. One can find the area and volume deficits at fixed radius,\r
and the relation to the Einstein tensor, in Section 17 (“Rie\u0002mannian coordinates and their applications”) of Pauli’s 1921\r
review of relativity [37]. Pauli cites Riemann, as well as con\u0002temporary researchers, for the relevant geometrical relations.\r
He does not remark that the Einstein equation can be char\u0002acterized purely in this manner. Feynman (in Section 11.2 of\r
[38] and Section 42-3 of [39]) expressed the Einstein equation\r
for d = 4 as the statement that, for all timelike directions, the\r

where M = T00V is the “mass” contained in the sphere. This\r

Appendix B: Conformal isometry of a flat causal diamond\r
The Minkowski line element ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r\r
2dΩ2\r
takes the form ds2 = −du dv + r\r
2dΩ2 with null coordinates\r
u = t − r and v = t + r. The diamond consists of the inter\u0002section of the regions u > −` and v < `. To determine the\r
conformal isometry that preserves the diamond, and is spher\u0002ically symmetric, note that any vector field of the form\r
ξ = A(u)∂u + B(v)∂v (B1)\r
is a conformal isometry of the dudv factor of the metric,\r
Lξdudv = [A0(u) + B0(v)]dudv (here Lξ is the Lie deriva\u0002tive along ξ). It will be a conformal isometry of the full\r
Minkowski metric provided Lξr\r
2 = [A0\r
(u) + B0(v)]r\r
2\r
. Us\u0002ing r = (v − u)/2 we find that in fact Lξr\r
2 = (B − A)r, so\r
ξ is a conformal Killing field if\r
[A\r
0\r
(u) + B\r
0\r
(v)](v − u)/2 = B(v) − A(u). (B2)\r
At u = v this implies B(v) = A(v), hence at v = 0 this\r
condition becomes [A0(u) + A0(0)]u/2 = A(u) − A(0). The\r
general solution is\r
A(u) = B(u) = a + bu + cu2. (B3)\r
The group generated by these vector fields is SL(2, R). To\r
map the diamond onto itself, the flow of ξ must leave invariant\r
the boundaries u = −` and v = `. This implies A(±`) =\r
0, hence A(u) = a(1 − u\r
2/`2\r
). Fixing the constant a by\r

Appendix C: Entropy of de Sitter space\r
A small diamond is conformally isometric to a static patch\r
of dS. The quantum statistical mechanics of dS was consid\u0002ered long ago by Gibbons and Hawking [40]. They examined\r
the thermal partition function and argued that, since Euclidean\r
dS is closed, the mass, angular momentum, and electric charge\r
vanish, so that the only term in the free energy for pure dS\r
space is the entropy term, FdS = −T S. The minimization\r
of dS free energy is thus equivalent to the maximization of\r
entropy.\r
This result can also be understood via the “first law of\r
event horizons” [41]. For a Schwarzschild black hole, this\r
law would read δM = (κ/8πG)δA + δEK, where M is the\r
mass, κ and A are the surface gravity and horizon area of the\r
black hole, and EK is the Killing energy of a matter fluid sur\u0002rounding the black hole [42]. For dS, instead the first law\r
reads\r
(κ/8πG)δA + δEK = 0. (C1)\r
There is no geometric total energy term since there is no\r
asymptotic region. The vanishing of the total entanglement\r
entropy variation ηδA|V + δSIR for a causal diamond is anal\u0002ogous to the first law of horizon mechanics in de Sitter space\r
(C1), identifying δEK with δSIR, except for the restriction to\r
fixed volume. This discrepancy can be traced to the fact that,\r
unlike de Sitter space, a flat causal diamond has a conformal\r
Killing vector rather than a true Killing vector. In fact, one can\r
derive a classical first law of flat causal diamonds which has\r
the form (C1), with δA replaced by δA|V , as we now demon\u0002strate.\r
Appendix D: First law of causal diamond mechanics\r
Consider a conformally spherical causal diamond in a con\u0002formally flat solution to a diffeomorphism invariant gravity\r
theory. There is a conformal Killing vector ζ that preserves\r
the diamond, and for which the edge of the diamond is the\r
bifurcation surface. We may invoke the variational identity\r
δHζ = δ\r
I\r
∂Σ\r
dQζ , (D1)\r
where Hζ is the Hamiltonian generating evolution along the\r
flow of ζ (constructed from the symplectic form evaluated

7\r
on the Lie derivative of the fields along ζ), Qζ is the asso\u0002ciated Noether charge (d − 2)-form, and the variation is to\r
any neighboring solution [43]. The surface integral yields\r
−(~κ/2π)δS, where S is the Wald entropy associated with\r
the edge. (I include the factor ~ in the prefactor and the im\u0002plicit 1/~ in the definition of the entropy, but these cancel in\r
this strictly classical relation.) If ζ were a Killing vector, δHζ\r
would vanish for all fields invariant under the Killing flow. For\r
matter treated as a fluid, it would not vanish, because the fluid\r
potentials do not share the symmetry of the metric [44, 45].\r
Thus, for example, if the diamond were the static patch of de\r
Sitter space in general relativity, we would recover in this way\r
the first law of de Sitter horizons, (κ/8πG)δA + δEζ = 0,\r
where δEζ is the matter Killing energy variation.\r
If ζ is only a conformal Killing vector, δHζ does not van\u0002ish. In general it receives contributions both from matter\r
and from the gravitational field. If the theory is general rel\u0002ativity, and the background solution is Minkowski spacetime,\r
then the gravitational field contribution to δHζ turns out to be\r
−(d − 2)κδV /8πG` (see below). When combined with the\r
area variation term −κδA/8πG, this yields −κ/8πG times\r
the area variation δA|V at fixed volume, [Eq. (5), main text].\r
Moreover, the conformal boost energy of the matter integrated\r
over Σ is given by the right hand side of [Eq. (8), main text],\r
when T00 is constant. In this way we see that (D1) recovers\r
the statement of [Eq. (8), main text], that addition of matter\r
energy to the diamond decreases the area of the boundary at\r
fixed volume.\r
To verify the result for δHζ quoted above, we may use the\r
expression for the symplectic form in [46],\r

In the case of interest the background metric gab is the\r
Minkowski metric ηab, γ2 is the tangent vector Lζ ηab to the\r
phase space flow generated by Hζ , and γ1 is an arbitrary phase\r
space tangent vector, i.e. a linearized solution about the back\u0002ground. Now the conformal Killing vector in Minkowski co\u0002ordinates is given by (B5), so we have\r

A link between the semiclassical Einstein equation and a maximal vacuum entanglement hypothesis is estab\u0002lished. The hypothesis asserts that entanglement entropy in small geodesic balls is maximized at fixed volume in\r
a locally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields. A qualitative argument suggests\r
that the Einstein equation implies validity of the hypothesis. A more precise argument shows that, for first-order\r
variations of the local vacuum state of conformal quantum fields, the vacuum entanglement is stationary if and\r
only if the Einstein equation holds. For nonconformal fields, the same conclusion follows modulo a conjecture\r
about the variation of entanglement entropy.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
When restricted to one side of a spatial partition, the vac\u0002uum state of a quantum field has entropy because the two sides\r
are entangled. The entanglement entropy of the restricted state\r
is dominated by the ultraviolet (UV) field degrees of freedom\r
near the interface, and hence scales with the area. This is sim\u0002ilar to the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy, A/4L\r
2\r
p\r
,\r
where A is the horizon area and Lp = (~G/c3)\r
1/2\r
is the\r
Planck length [1–3]. The similarity of these two “area laws” is\r
striking, and has led to the idea that black hole entropy is just a\r
special case of vacuum entanglement entropy [4–9]. To match\r
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, vacuum entanglement en\u0002tropy should be cut off at the Planck scale. Considering the\r
gravitational backreaction of vacuum fluctuations, such a cut\u0002off appears natural [7, 10], but it lies deep in the regime of\r
poorly understood quantum gravity effects.\r
Bekenstein defined the generalized entropy Sgen as the sum\r
of the horizon entropy and the ordinary entropy in the exterior.\r
If the horizon entropy is indeed entanglement entropy, then\r
the (fine-grained) generalized entropy is nothing but the total\r
von Neumann entropy of the quantum state outside the hori\u0002zon [9, 11, 12]. Bekenstein proposed the generalized second\r
law (GSL) stating that Sgen never decreases [2]. The GSL has\r
been shown to hold in various regimes [13], the proofs having\r
been recently strengthened to apply to rapid changes and arbi\u0002trary horizon slices [14, 15]. The validity of the law depends\r
on the Einstein equation, which relates the curvature — and\r
therefore the focusing of light rays that determines the change\r
of horizon area — to the local energy-momentum density of\r
matter.\r
The GSL thus points to a deep link between vacuum entan\u0002glement and the Einstein equation. The aim of this paper is to\r
better understand the nature of this link. Motivated by the no\u0002tion of vacuum as an equilibrium state, I formulate a maximal\r
vacuum entanglement hypothesis (MVEH):\r
When the geometry and quantum fields are si\u0002multaneously varied from maximal symmetry, the\r
entanglement entropy in a small geodesic ball is\r
maximal at fixed volume.\r
∗ jacobson@umd.edu\r
This is formulated in the context of semiclassical gravity, i.e.\r
quantum fields on a classical spacetime. As such, it is predi\u0002cated on the following assumption:\r
The area density of vacuum entanglement entropy\r
η is finite and universal.\r
This assumption is supported by the evidence that horizon en\u0002tropy can indeed be identified with entanglement entropy (see,\r
e.g. [9, 16, 17], and references therein). However, it involves\r
UV aspects of quantum gravity that are not currently under\u0002stood, so it remains an assumption.\r
I will argue that the Einstein equation supports the MVEH\r
and, conversely, that the MVEH implies the Einstein equation\r
for first-order variations of the local vacuum state for confor\u0002mal fields. For nonconformal fields the result holds modulo a\r
conjecture about the variation of entanglement entropy to be\r
explained below. It is well known that diffeomorphism invari\u0002ance selects the Einstein equation, at second order in deriva\u0002tives, as the unique gravitational field equation in a metric\r
theory. Since the MVEH is formulated in a diffeomorphism\u0002invariant fashion, it is therefore not surprising that the Ein\u0002stein equation would arise. Nevertheless, entropy maximiza\u0002tion is quite different from Hamilton’s principle of stationary\r
action, so something new is learned here. Moreover, the New\u0002ton constant that appears in the derived Einstein equation—\r
which is not fixed by diffeomorphism invariance—has pre\u0002cisely the value required in order for η to correspond to the\r
Bekenstein-Hawking value, 1/4~G. This is a nontrivial and\r
essential consistency property of the derivation.\r
Two lines of evidence motivated this paper. First, the Ein\u0002stein equation can be derived as a thermodynamic equation\r
of state of the vacuum outside a local causal horizon [18].\r
That derivation assumes that the entropy change of an other\u0002wise stationary horizon is given by δQ/T when a local boost\r
energy δQ crosses the horizon, T = ~/2π being the Unruh\r

II. AREA DEFICIT AND GENERAL RELATIVITY\r
Einstein’s field equation,\r
Gab = 8πG Tab, (1)\r
relates the Einstein curvature tensor Gab to the energy\u0002momentum tensor of matter, Tab. Central to our story is the\r
equivalence of (1) to the statement that the surface area deficit\r
of any small, spacelike geodesic ball of fixed volume is pro\u0002portional to the energy density in the ball.1 We begin by\r
demonstrating this lovely relation.\r
At any point o in a spacetime of dimension d, choose an\r
arbitrary timelike unit vector u\r
a\r
, and generate a (d − 1)-\r
dimensional spacelike ball Σ by sending out geodesics of\r
length ` from o in all directions orthogonal to u\r
a\r
. The point\r
o is the center of the ball, and the boundary ∂Σ is the surface\r
(see the grey region of Fig. 1). Choose a Riemann normal co\u0002ordinate (RNC) system based at o, launched from an orthonor\u0002mal basis formed by u\r
a\r
and d − 1 spacelike vectors tangent\r
to Σ. Let the timelike coordinate be x\r
0\r
, and let the spacelike\r
ones be {x\r
i}. The signature of the spacetime metric is taken\r
here to be (−+++), and units are chosen with c = 1.\r
We will assume the radius of the ball is much smaller than\r
the local curvature length,\r
` \u001C Lcurvature (2)\r
and work to lowest nontrivial order in their ratio. The volume\r
variation at fixed radius, relative to flat space, is then given by\r
δV |` = −\r
Ωd−2`\r
d+1\r
6(d − 1)(d + 1)R, (3)\r
where R = Rik\r
ik is the spatial Ricci scalar at o (see Ap\u0002pendix A for details), and the area variation of ∂Σ is given by\r
dδV /d`, i.e.\r
δA|` = −\r
Ωd−2`\r
d\r
6(d − 1)R. (4)\r
We will also be interested in the area variation at fixed vol\u0002ume, rather than at fixed geodesic radius. When the radius\r
of the ball varies, the volume and area variations have the\r
additional contributions δrV = `\r

bottom vertices and on ∂Σ. The vectors show ζ at four points of Σ.\r
This is smaller by the factor 3/(d + 1) than the variation at\r

To connect now with spacetime and the Einstein equation,\r
note that the spatial Ricci scalar at o is equal to twice the RNC\r

Conversely, this simple geometrical relation contains the full\r
content of Einstein’s equation, if it holds at all spacetime\r
points and for all timelike unit vectors.\r
The evidence that the Einstein equation implies maximal\r
vacuum entanglement can now be stated in a qualitative, in\u0002tuitive fashion. Suppose the ball has a Bekenstein-Hawking\r
entropy A/4~G, arising from vacuum entanglement, and we\r
try to increase the entropy by placing an entangled qbit in the\r
ball. To localize the qbit within a region of size ` we must\r
give it an energy of at least ~/` which, according to (8), will\r
contribute an area deficit of order ~G, hence a surface entropy\r
decrease of order unity, offsetting the added qbit. It would\r
not help to use a “highly entropic object” with many internal\r
states, because the existence of such objects makes its mark in\r
the vacuum as well, diluting the entropic effect of adding the\r
object to the ball. Indeed, in the context of the Rindler wedge,\r
it was argued that δS ≤ δE/T, where T is the Unruh temper\u0002ature ~/2π and δE is the change of boost Killing energy, since

3\r
a thermal state maximizes entropy at fixed energy [22, 23]. We\r
now proceed to make this link between the Einstein equation\r
and maximal vacuum entanglement more precise.\r
III. CAUSAL DIAMOND AND CONFORMAL ISOMETRY\r
To evaluate the variation of the entanglement entropy in a\r
spacelike geodesic ball Σ it is helpful to consider the space\u0002time region causally determined by Σ, called the causal di\u0002amond D(Σ). In a maximally symmetric spacetime, D(Σ)\r
is the intersection of the future of a past vertex and the past\r
of a future vertex, and has a conformal isometry and rota\u0002tional symmetry in the rest frame defined by these vertices\r
(see Fig. 1).\r
The Minkowski line element ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r\r
2dΩ2\r
takes the form ds2 = −du dv + r\r
2dΩ2 with null coordinates\r
u = t−r and v = t+r. The Minkowski diamond centered on\r
the origin consists of the intersection of the regions u > −`\r
and v < `. The unique conformal isometry that preserves the\r
diamond, and is spherically symmetric, is generated by the\r
conformal Killing vector\r

. (10)\r
The Lie derivative of the Minkowski metric along ζ is\r
Lζ ηab = −(2t/`) ηab. (11)\r
The vector ζ is tangent to the null generators on the past and\r
future null boundaries of the diamond, so those boundaries\r
are conformal Killing horizons [24]. They meet at the ball\r
boundary ∂Σ, where ζ vanishes, so ∂Σ is a bifurcation sur\u0002face. The surface gravity κ of a conformal Killing horizon is\r
well-defined by the equation ∇aζ\r
2 = −2κζa [25], and with\r
the normalization of ζ in (9) it is equal to unity.\r
IV. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY OF A DIAMOND\r
The entanglement entropy in a diamond D(Σ) is the same\r
as that in Σ. Under a simultaneous variation of the geome\u0002try and the state of the quantum fields, (δgab, δ|ψi), the dia\u0002mond entanglement entropy variation will consist of two con\u0002tributions, a state-independent UV part δSUV from the area\r
change induced by δgab, and a state-dependent IR part δSIR\r
from δ|ψi.\r
As mentioned above, we are assuming that, as a result of\r
the UV physics, the entanglement entropy in a spatial region\r
is finite in any state, with a leading term ηA. Here A is the\r
area of the boundary of the region and η is a universal con\u0002stant with dimensions [length]2−d\r
. The scaling with area is\r
natural in any theory with a large density of states at short\r
distances. The assumption that η is universal is motivated by\r
the idea that the UV structure of the vacuum is common to all\r
states in the class being considered.2 Under this assumption,\r
when the geometry is varied, the contribution to the entangle\u0002ment entropy in Σ from the UV degrees of freedom near the\r
boundary ∂Σ changes by an amount\r
δSUV = η δA. (12)\r
The total entropy variation will thus be given by\r
δStot = η δA + δSIR (13)\r
If η = 1/4~G, (12) coincides with the variation of Beken\u0002stein’s generalized entropy, here interpreted as simply the to\u0002tal entropy in the diamond. The MVEH implies that the total\r
entropy variation (13) is zero at first order , and negative for\r
finite variations, when comparing to a maximally symmetric\r
spacetime with the volume of Σ held fixed.\r
To motivate this equilibrium condition, we first recall\r
that, for ordinary thermodynamic systems in equilibrium, the\r
Helmholtz free energy F = E − T S is minimized at fixed\r
volume. The MVEH is analogous, but with the additional fea\u0002ture that the energy vanishes. That the free energy of a di\u0002amond has no energy term can be motivated by comparison\r
with de Sitter spacetime, and the restriction to fixed volume\r
arises from the fact that the diamond has a conformal Killing\r
vector rather than a true Killing vector (see Appendices C and\r
D).\r
Our next step is to evaluate δSIR. The vacuum state of any\r
QFT, restricted to the diamond, can be expressed (formally)\r
as a thermal density matrix,\r
ρ = Z\r
−1\r
exp(−K/T), T = ~/2π, (14)\r
where K is the “modular Hamiltonian”. The temperature\r
T = ~/2π is factored out here so that K will be the gener\u0002ator of Lorentz boosts, i.e. hyperbolic angle shifts, at the edge\r
of the diamond. For an infinite diamond that coincides with\r
the Rindler wedge in Minkowski space, T is the Unruh tem\u0002perature [27, 28].\r
Because ρ in (14) has the form of a thermal state, it mini\u0002mizes the modular free energy,\r
FK = hKi − T S, (15)\r
where the brackets denote quantum expectation value, and\r
S = − Tr ρ ln ρ is the von Neumann entropy. The variation\r
δFK must therefore vanish for any small variation δρ of the\r
state, i.e.\r
δS =\r

that what appeared in δhKi would be just the tracefree part of hTabi.\r

MSS as a local state parameter that is effectively constant in a\r
small diamond but may depend on the diamond.\r
The Einstein tensor in a MSS is GMSS\r
ab = −λgab, with λ\r
a curvature scale. When the metric is varied away from the\r
MSS, the area variation at fixed volume is obtained to lowest\r

The Einstein tensor should presumably be understood here as\r

maximized is, by definition, an expectation value. In using\r
(21) for the matter entanglement variation, we are neglecting\r
corrections that would come from the curvature of the MSS,\r
since those would be of higher order.\r

points and with all timelike unit vectors implies a tensor equa\u0002tion,\r

title = "VI. DISCUSSION"
text = """
We have shown, given our assumptions, that the semiclas\u0002sical Einstein equation holds, for first-order variations of the\r
vacuum, if and only if the entropy in small causal diamonds is\r
stationary at constant volume, when varied from a maximally\r
symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields. We\r
assumed the diamond size ` is much smaller than the local\r
curvature length, the wavelength of any excitations of the vac\u0002uum, and the scales in the matter field theory, but much larger\r
than the UV scale at which quantum gravity effects become\r
strong. Our entanglement variation assumption for noncon\u0002formal matter (21) concerns only standard QFT, and is either\r
true or false.\r
Strictly speaking the “first-order variation” refers to the\r
derivative with respect to a parameter labeling the state, evalu\u0002ated at the vacuum. To be physically applicable, however, the\r
result should apply to finite but small variations. The example\r
of a coherent state reveals a challenge in this regard [33]: Such\r
a state can have nonzero energy density while leaving entan\u0002glement entropy unchanged [34, 35]. That is, not all energy\r
registers as a change of entanglement. This is consistent with\r
the hypothesis of maximal vacuum entanglement, although\r
the Einstein equation implies that the entropy has decreased\r
— relative to vacuum — by more than it needs to in order to\r
satisfy the hypothesis. Unless a further consequence of that\r
hypothesis is found, or the hypothesis is refined and strength\u0002ened in some way, the Einstein equation does not appear to\r
follow from it in all generality.\r
We close with some questions and remarks concerning the\r
derivation and its implications.\r
• Do graviton fluctuations contribute to the entanglement\r
entropy? The UV part of the entanglement entropy\r
S = ηA is inscrutable at this level, and the IR part does\r
not include gravitons. Since the diamond is taken much\r
smaller than the wavelength of any ambient gravitons,\r
they have no gauge-invariant meaning in the diamond.\r
In the RNC gauge they are absent at first derivative or\u0002der. Moreover, the full, nonlinear Einstein tensor al\u0002ready appears on the geometric side of the equation, so\r
it would be double counting to include any graviton en\u0002ergy.\r
• Can a gravitational field equation with higher curvature\r
corrections be derived along these lines? Maybe. We\r
neglected terms of order `/Lcurv in the geometry cal\u0002culations, whereas a next-higher-curvature correction to\r
the field equation might be of order (`1/Lcurv)\r
2\r
, where\r
`\r
2\r
1\r
is the relative coefficient of the curvature squared\r
term in the action. To capture this within our approxi\u0002mation would require `/`1 < `1/Lcurv. The right-hand\r
side is presumably less than unity, in order for higher\u0002curvature terms to not dominate, so the diamond would\r
have to be taken smaller than `1. If, say, `1 were the\r
string length, would classical geometry and quantum\r
field theory apply at that scale? Probably not. On the\r
other hand, perhaps with improved accuracy of the ge\u0002ometric analysis, and the inclusion of subleading UV\r
terms in the entanglement entropy, one could consis\u0002tently capture higher-curvature corrections using a dia\u0002mond larger than `1.\r
• A derivation of Einstein’s equation invoking a quan\u0002tum limit to measurements of the spacetime geometry\r
of small causal diamonds was given in Ref. [36]. How\r
are the assumptions used there related to those made\r
here?\r
• According to our derivation the Einstein equation is a\r
property of vacuum equilibrium. Does this suggest how\r
to include nonequilibrium effects?\r

A(u) = B(u) = a + bu + cu2. (B3)\r
The group generated by these vector fields is SL(2, R). To\r
map the diamond onto itself, the flow of ξ must leave invariant\r
the boundaries u = −` and v = `. This implies A(±`) =\r
0, hence A(u) = a(1 − u\r
2/`2\r
). Fixing the constant a by\r
requiring that ξ have unit surface gravity, we thus obtain the\r

Appendix C: Entropy of de Sitter space\r
A small diamond is conformally isometric to a static patch\r
of dS. The quantum statistical mechanics of dS was consid\u0002ered long ago by Gibbons and Hawking [40]. They examined\r
the thermal partition function and argued that, since Euclidean\r
dS is closed, the mass, angular momentum, and electric charge\r
vanish, so that the only term in the free energy for pure dS\r
space is the entropy term, FdS = −T S. The minimization\r
of dS free energy is thus equivalent to the maximization of\r
entropy.\r
This result can also be understood via the “first law of\r
event horizons” [41]. For a Schwarzschild black hole, this\r
law would read δM = (κ/8πG)δA + δEK, where M is the\r
mass, κ and A are the surface gravity and horizon area of the\r
black hole, and EK is the Killing energy of a matter fluid sur\u0002rounding the black hole [42]. For dS, instead the first law\r
reads\r
(κ/8πG)δA + δEK = 0. (C1)\r
There is no geometric total energy term since there is no\r
asymptotic region. The vanishing of the total entanglement\r
entropy variation ηδA|V + δSIR for a causal diamond is anal\u0002ogous to the first law of horizon mechanics in de Sitter space\r
(C1), identifying δEK with δSIR, except for the restriction to\r
fixed volume. This discrepancy can be traced to the fact that,\r
unlike de Sitter space, a flat causal diamond has a conformal\r
Killing vector rather than a true Killing vector. In fact, one can\r
derive a classical first law of flat causal diamonds which has\r
the form (C1), with δA replaced by δA|V , as we now demon\u0002strate.\r
Appendix D: First law of causal diamond mechanics\r
Consider a conformally spherical causal diamond in a con\u0002formally flat solution to a diffeomorphism invariant gravity\r
theory. There is a conformal Killing vector ζ that preserves\r
the diamond, and for which the edge of the diamond is the\r
bifurcation surface. We may invoke the variational identity\r
δHζ = δ\r
I\r
∂Σ\r
dQζ , (D1)\r
where Hζ is the Hamiltonian generating evolution along the\r
flow of ζ (constructed from the symplectic form evaluated

7\r
on the Lie derivative of the fields along ζ), Qζ is the asso\u0002ciated Noether charge (d − 2)-form, and the variation is to\r
any neighboring solution [43]. The surface integral yields\r
−(~κ/2π)δS, where S is the Wald entropy associated with\r
the edge. (I include the factor ~ in the prefactor and the im\u0002plicit 1/~ in the definition of the entropy, but these cancel in\r
this strictly classical relation.) If ζ were a Killing vector, δHζ\r
would vanish for all fields invariant under the Killing flow. For\r
matter treated as a fluid, it would not vanish, because the fluid\r
potentials do not share the symmetry of the metric [44, 45].\r
Thus, for example, if the diamond were the static patch of de\r
Sitter space in general relativity, we would recover in this way\r
the first law of de Sitter horizons, (κ/8πG)δA + δEζ = 0,\r
where δEζ is the matter Killing energy variation.\r
If ζ is only a conformal Killing vector, δHζ does not van\u0002ish. In general it receives contributions both from matter\r
and from the gravitational field. If the theory is general rel\u0002ativity, and the background solution is Minkowski spacetime,\r
then the gravitational field contribution to δHζ turns out to be\r
−(d − 2)κδV /8πG` (see below). When combined with the\r
area variation term −κδA/8πG, this yields −κ/8πG times\r
the area variation δA|V at fixed volume, [Eq. (5), main text].\r
Moreover, the conformal boost energy of the matter integrated\r
over Σ is given by the right hand side of [Eq. (8), main text],\r
when T00 is constant. In this way we see that (D1) recovers\r
the statement of [Eq. (8), main text], that addition of matter\r
energy to the diamond decreases the area of the boundary at\r
fixed volume.\r
To verify the result for δHζ quoted above, we may use the\r
expression for the symplectic form in [46],\r

In the case of interest the background metric gab is the\r
Minkowski metric ηab, γ2 is the tangent vector Lζ ηab to the\r
phase space flow generated by Hζ , and γ1 is an arbitrary phase\r
space tangent vector, i.e. a linearized solution about the back\u0002ground. Now the conformal Killing vector in Minkowski co\u0002ordinates is given by (B5), so we have\r
γ2 ef = Lζ ηef = −\r

The surface gravity is unity for the chosen conformal Killing\r
