Abstract.\r
We propose a new action principle to be associated with a noncommutative space (A, H, D). The universal formula for the spectral action is (ψ, Dψ) + Trace(χ(D/\r
Λ)) whereψ is a spinor on the Hilbert space, Λ is a scale andχ a positive func\u0002tion. When this principle is applied to the noncommutative space defined by the\r
spectrum of the standard model one obtains the standard model action coupled to\r
Einstein plus Weyl gravity. There are relations between the gauge coupling con\u0002stants identical to those of SU(5) as well as the Higgs self-coupling, to be taken\r
at a fixed high energy scale.\r

1. Introduction.\r
The basic data of Riemannian geometry consists in a manifold M whose\r
points x ∈ M are locally labelled by finitely many coordinates x\r
µ ∈ R, and in the\r
infinitesimal line element, ds,\r
ds2 = gµν dxµdxν. (1.1)\r
The laws of physics at reasonably low energies are well encoded by the action\r
functional,\r
I = IE + ISM (1.2)\r
where IE =\r
1\r
16πG\r
R\r
R\r
√g d4x is the Einstein action, which depends only upon\r
the 4-geometry (we shall work throughout in the Euclidean, i.e. imaginary time\r
formalism) and where ISM is the standard model action, ISM =\r
R\r
LSM, LSM =\r
LG + LGH + LH + LGf + LHf . The action functional ISM involves, besides the\r
4-geometry, several additional fields: bosons G of spin 1 such as γ, W± and Z,\r
and the eight gluons, bosons of spin 0 such as the Higgs field H and fermions f of\r
spin 1/2, the quarks and leptons.\r
These additional fields have a priori a very different status than the geometry\r
(M, g) and the gauge invariance group which governs their interaction is a priori\r
very different from the diffeomorphism group which governs the invariance of the\r
Einstein action. In fact the natural group of invariance of the functional (1.2) is\r
the semidirect product,\r
G = U >⊳ Diff(M) (1.3)\r
of the group of local gauge transformations, U = C∞(M, U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3))\r
by the natural action of Diff(M).\r
The basic data of noncommutative geometry consists of an involutive algebra A\r
of operators in Hilbert space H and of a selfadjoint unbounded operator D in H\r
[1-6].\r
The inverse D−1 of D plays the role of the infinitesimal unit of length ds of ordinary\r
geometry.\r
To a Riemannian compact spin manifold corresponds the spectral triple given by\r
the algebra A = C∞(M) of smooth functions on M, the Hilbert space H =\r
L\r
2\r
(M, S) of L\r
2\r
-spinors and the Dirac operator D of the Levi-Civita Spin connec\u0002tion. The line element ds is by construction the propagator of fermions,\r
ds = ×—× . (1.4)\r

No information is lost in trading the original Riemannian manifold M for the\r
corresponding spectral triple (A, H, D). The points of M are recovered as the\r
characters of the involutive algebra A, i.e. as the homomorphisms ρ : A → C\r
(linear maps such that ρ(ab) = ρ(a) ρ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A). The geodesic distance\r
between points is recovered by\r
d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} . (1.5)\r
More importantly one can characterize the spectral triples (A, H, D) which come\r
from the above spinorial construction by very simple axioms ([4]) which involve\r
the dimension n of M. The parity of n implies a Z/2 grading γ of the Hilbert\r
space H such that,\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γa = aγ ∀ a ∈ A , γD = −Dγ . (1.6)\r
Moreover one keeps track of the real structure on H as an antilinear isometry J in\r
H satisfying simple relations\r
J\r
2 = ε , JD = ε′DJ , Jγ = ε′′γJ ; ε, ε′\r
, ε′′ ∈ {−1, 1} (1.7)\r
where the value of ε, ε′, ε′′ is determined by n modulo 8. One first virtue of these\r
axioms is to allow for a shift of point of view, similar to Fourier transform, in which\r
the usual emphasis on the points x ∈ M of a geometric space is now replaced by\r
the spectrum Σ ⊂ R of the operator D. Indeed, if one forgets about the algebra\r
A in the spectral triple (A, H, D) but retains only the operators D, γ and J\r
acting in H one can (using (1.7)) characterize this data by the spectrum Σ of D\r
which is a discrete subset with multiplicity of R. In the even case Σ = −Σ. The\r
existence of Riemannian manifolds which are isospectral (i.e. have the same Σ)\r
but not isometric shows that the following hypothesis is stronger than the usual\r
diffeomorphism invariance of the action of general relativity,\r
“The physical action only depends upon Σ .” (1.8)\r
In order to apply this principle to the action (1.2) we need to exploit a second\r
virtue of the axioms (cf. [4]) which is that they do not require the commutativity\r
of the algebra A. Instead one only needs the much weaker form,\r
ab0 = b\r
0\r
a ∀ a, b ∈ A with b\r
0 = Jb∗\r
J\r
−1\r
. (1.9)\r

In the usual Riemannian case the group Diff(M) of diffeomorphisms of M is\r
canonically isomorphic to the group Aut(A) of automorphisms of the algebra\r
A = C∞(M). To each ϕ ∈ Diff(M) one associates the algebra preserving map\r
αϕ : A → A given by\r
αϕ(f) = f ◦ ϕ\r
−1 ∀ f ∈ C∞(M) = A . (1.10)\r
In general the group Aut(A) of automorphisms of the involutive algebra A plays\r
the role of the diffeomorphisms of the noncommutative (or spectral for short)\r
geometry (A, H, D). The first interesting new feature of the general case is that\r
the group Aut(A) has a natural normal subgroup,\r
Int(A) ⊂ Aut(A) (1.11)\r
where an automorphism α is inner iff there exists a unitary operator u ∈ A,\r
(uu∗ = u\r
∗u = 1) such that,\r
α(a) = uau∗ ∀ a ∈ A . (1.12)\r
The corresponding exact sequence of groups,\r
1 → Int(A) → Aut(A) → Out(A) → 1 (1.13)\r
looks very similar to the exact sequence\r
1 → U → G → Diff(M) → 1 (1.14)\r
which describes the structure of the symmetry group G of the action functional\r
(1.2).\r
Comparing (1.13) and (1.14) and taking into account the action of inner automor\u0002phisms of A in H given by\r
ξ → u(u\r
∗\r
)\r
0\r
ξ = uξu∗(1.15)\r
one determines the algebra A such that Aut( g A) = G (where Aut takes into account g\r
the action of automorphisms in the Hilbert space H). The answer is\r
A = C\r
∞(M) ⊗ AF (1.16)\r
4

where the algebra AF is finite dimensional,\r
AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3(C) (1.17)\r
where H ⊂ M2(C) is the algebra of quaternions,\r
H =\r
\u001A\u0012 α β\r
−β¯ α¯\r
\u0013\r
; α, β ∈ C\r
\u001B\r
. (1.18)\r
Giving the algebra A does not suffice to determine the spectral geometry, one\r
still needs the action of A in H and the operator D. Since A is a tensor product\r
(16) which geometrically corresponds to a product space, an instance of spectral\r
geometry for A is given by the product rule,\r
H = L\r
2\r
(M, S) ⊗ HF , D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF (1.19)\r
where (HF , DF ) is a spectral geometry on AF , while both L\r
2\r
(M, S) and the Dirac\r
operator ∂/M on M are as above.\r
Since AF is finite dimensional the dimension of the corresponding space is 0 so\r
that HF must be finite dimensional. The list of elementary fermions provides a\r
natural candidate for HF . One lets HF be the Hilbert space with basis labelled\r
by elementary leptons and quarks. Thus for the first generation of leptons we get\r
eL, eR, νL, e¯L, e¯R, ν¯L for instance, as the corresponding basis. The Z/2 grading γF\r
is given by +1 for left handed particles and −1 for right handed ones. For quarks\r
one has an additional color index, y, r, b. The involution J is just such that Jf = ¯f\r
for any f in the basis. One has J\r
2 = 1, Jγ = γJ as dictated by the dimension\r
n = 0. Moreover the algebra AF has a natural representation in HF and:\r
ab0 = b\r
0\r
a ∀ a, b ∈ AF , b0 = Jb∗J\r
−1\r
. (1.20)\r
Finally there is a natural matrix acting in the finite dimensional Hilbert space HF .\r
It is\r
DF =\r
\u0014\r
Y 0\r
0 Y¯\r
\u0015\r
, (1.21)\r
where Y is the Yukawa coupling matrix.\r
The special features of Y show that the algebraic rule\r
[[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A (1.22)\r
5

which is one of the essential axioms, holds for the spectral geometry (AF , HF , DF )\r
= F. Of course this 0-dimensional geometry is encoding the knowledge of the\r
fermions of the standard model and it is a basic question to understand and char\u0002acterize it abstractly, but let us postpone this problem and proceed with the\r
product geometry M × F.\r
The next important new feature of the noncommutative case is the following. We\r
saw that the group Aut(A) of diffeomorphisms falls in equivalence classes under\r
the normal subgroup Int(A) of inner automorphisms. In the same way the space of\r
metrics has a natural foliation into equivalence classes. The internal fluctuations\r
of a given metric are given by the formula,\r
D = D0 + A + JAJ−1, A = Σ ai[D0, bi] , ai, bi ∈ A and A = A\r
∗\r
. (1.23)\r
Thus starting from (A, H, D0) with obvious notations, one leaves the representa\u0002tion of A in H untouched and just perturbs the operator D0 by (1.23) where A is\r
an arbitrary self-adjoint operator in H of the form A = Σ ai[D0, bi] ; ai, bi ∈ A.\r
One checks that this does not alter the axioms (check (1.22) for instance). These\r
fluctuations are trivial: D = D0 in the usual Riemannian case in the same way as\r
the group of inner automorphisms Int(A) = {1} is trivial for A = C∞(M).\r
In general the natural action of Int( f A) on the space of metrics restricts to the\r
above equivalence classes and is simply given by (for the automorphism associated\r
to u ∈ A, uu∗ = u\r
∗u = 1),\r
ξ ∈ H → uξu∗ = uu∗0ξ , A → u[D, u∗] + uAu∗. (1.24)\r
When one computes the internal fluctuations of the above product geometry M×F\r
one finds ([6]) that they are parametrized exactly by the bosons γ, W±, Z, the eight\r
gluons and the Higgs fields H of the standard model. The equality\r
Z\r
M\r
(LGf + LHf )\r
√\r
g d4x = hψ, Dψi (1.25)\r
gives the contribution to (1.2) of the last two term of the SM Lagrangian in terms\r
of the operator D alone.\r
The operator D encodes the metric of our “discrete Kaluza Klein” geometry M ×F\r
but this metric is no longer the product metric as it was for D0. In fact the initial\r
scale given by DF completely disappears when one considers the arbitrary internal\r
fluctuations of D0 = ∂/M ⊗1+γ5 ⊗DF . What remains is to understand in a purely\r
6

gravitational manner the 4 remaining terms of the action (1.2). This is where we\r
apply the basic principle (1.8).\r
We shall check in this paper that for any smooth cutoff function χ, χ(λ) = 1 for\r
|λ| ≤ 1, one has\r
Trace χ\r
\u0012\r
D\r
Λ\r
\u0013\r
= IE + IG + IGH + IH + IC + 0(Λ−∞) (1.26)\r
where IC is a sum of a cosmological term, a term of Weyl gravity and a term in\r
R\r
R H2 √g d4x. The computation in itself is not new, and goes back to the work\r
of DeWitt [7]. Similar computations also occur in the theory of induced gravity\r
[8]. It is clear that the left hand side of (1.26) only depends upon the spectrum\r
Σ of the operator D, and following our principle (1.8) this allows to take it as the\r
natural candidate for the bare action at the cutoff scale Λ.\r
In our framework there is a natural way to cutoff the geometry at a given energy\r
scale Λ, which has been developed in [9] for some concrete examples. It consists\r
in replacing the Hilbert space H by the subspace HΛ,\r
HΛ = range χ\r
\u0012\r
D\r
Λ\r
\u0013\r
(1.27)\r
and restricting both D and A to this subspace, while maintaining the commutation\r
rule (1.20) for the algebra A. This procedure is superior to the familiar lattice\r
approximation because it does respect the geometric symmetry group. The point\r
is that finite dimensional noncommutative algebras have continuous Lie groups of\r
automorphisms while the automorphism group of a commutative finite dimensional\r
algebra is necessarily finite. The hypothesis which we shall test in this paper is\r
that there exist an energy scale Λ in the range 1015 − 1019 Gev at which the bare\r
action (1.2) becomes geometric, i.e. ∼\r
Trace χ\r

D\r
Λ\r
\u0013\r
+ hψ, Dψi. (1.28)\r
2. The spectral action principle applied to the Einstein-Yang-Mills\r
system.\r
To test the spectral action functional (1.28) we shall first consider the sim\u0002plest noncommutative modification of a manifold M. Thus we replace the algebra\r
7

C∞(M) of smooth functions on M by the tensor product A = C∞(M) ⊗ MN (C)\r
where MN (C) is the algebra of N × N matrices. The spectral triple is obtained by\r
tensoring the Dirac spectral triple for M by the spectral triple for MN (C) given\r
by the left action of MN (C) on the Hilbert space of N × N matrices with Hilbert\u0002Schmidt norm while the operator is 0. The real structure is given by the adjoint\r
operation, m → m∗ on matrices. Thus for the product geometry one has\r
H = L\r
2\r
(M, S) ⊗ MN (C)\r
J(ξ ⊗ m) = Cξ ⊗ m∗(2.1)\r
D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 .\r
We shall compare the spectral action functional (1.28) with the following\r

(LG + LGf )\r
√g d4x is the action for an SU(N) Yang-Mills theory\r
coupled to fermions in the adjoint representation.\r
Starting with (2.1), one first computes the internal fluctuations of the metric and\r
finds that they are parametrized exactly by an SU(N) Yang Mills field A. Note\r
that the formula D = D0 + A + JAJ∗eliminates the U(1) part of A even if one\r
starts with an U(N) gauge potential.\r
One also checks that the coupling of the Yang Mills field A with the fermions is\r
equal to\r

We shall adopt Wilson’s view point of the renormalization group approach to field\r
theory [13] where the spectral action is taken to give the bare action with bare\r
quantities m0 and g0 and with a cutoff scale Λ where the theory is assumed to\r
take a geometrical form. Introducing the cutoff scale Λ will regularize the theory.\r
The perturbative expansion is then reexpressed in terms of renormalized physical\r
quanties. The fields also receive wave function renormalization. Normalizing the\r
Einstein and Yang-Mills terms in the bare action we then have:\r

This adds one further boundary condition for the equations (2.29):\r

The renormalized fermionic action (ψ, Dψ) keeps the same form as the bare\r
fermionic action.\r
The renormalization group equations will yield relations between the bare quanti\u0002ties and the physical quantities with the addition of the cutoff scale Λ. Conditions\r
on the bare quantities would translate into conditions on the physical quantities.\r
In the present example only the gauge coupling g(Λ) and Newton’s constant will\r
have measurable effects. The dependence of κ0 on κ and the other physical quan\u0002tities is such that κ\r
−2\r

contains terms proportional to the cutoff scale. As κ\r
2\r
must be identified with 8πG at low energy it is clear that both κ\r

and Λ could\r
be as high as the Planck scale(∗)\r
The renormalization group equations of this system were studied by Fradkin and\r
Tseytlin [15] and is known to be renormalizable, but non-unitary [14] due to the\r

presence of spin-two ghost (tachyon) pole near the Planck mass. We shall not\r
worry about non-unitarity (see, however, reference 16), because in our view at the\r
Planck energy the manifold structure of space-time will break down and one must\r
have a completely finite theory where only the part of the Hilbert space given by\r
χ(D2)H enters. The algebra A becomes finite dimensional in such a way that all\r
symmetries of the continuum (in some approximation) would be admitted.\r
In the limit of flat space-time we have gµν = δµν and the action (2.11) becomes\r

where we have droped the constant term. This action is known to have N = 1\r
global supersymmetry. In reality we can also obtain the N = 2 and N = 4\r
super Yang-Mills actions by taking the appropriate Dirac operators in six and ten\r
dimensions respectively [17].\r
3. Spectral action for the standard model.\r
Having illustrated the computation of our spectral action for the Einstein\u0002Yang-Mills system we now address the realistic case of obtaining action (1.2) for\r
the Einstein-Standard model system.\r
We first briefly summarize the spectral triple (A, H, D) associated with the spec\u0002trum of the standard model. A complete treatment can be found in [4,6].\r
The geometry is that of a 4-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold with a fixed\r
spin structure times a discrete geometry. The product geometry is given by the\r
rules\r
A = A1 ⊗ A2 , H = H1 ⊗ H2 , D = D1 ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ D2 (3.1)\r
where A1 = C∞(M), D1 = ∂/M the Dirac operator on M, H1 = L\r
2\r
(M, S) and\r
the discrete geometry (A2, H2, D2) will now be described. The algebra A2 is the\r
direct sum of the real involutive algebras C of complex numbers, H of quaternions,\r
and M3(C) of 3 × 3 matrices. H2 is the Hilbert space with basis the elementary\r
fermions, namely the quarks Q, leptons L and their charge conjugates, where\r
Q =\r

and we have omitted family indices for Q and L and colour index for Q. The\r
antilinear isometry J = J2 in H2 exchanges a fermions with its conjugate.\r
The action of an element a = (λ, q, m) ∈ A2 in H2 is given by:\r
a Q =\r

For the operator D2 we take D2 =\r

The parameter µ has the dimension of mass.\r
The choice of the Dirac operator and the action of A2 in H2 comes from the\r
restrictions that these must satisfy:\r
J\r
2 = 1 , [J, D2] = 0 , [a, Jb∗J−1\r
] = 0\r
[[D, a], Jb∗J\r
−1\r
] = 0 ∀ a, b . (3.7)\r
The next step is to compute the inner fluctuations of the metric and thus the\r
operators of the form: A = Σ ai[D, bi]. This with the self-adjointness condition\r
15

A = A∗ gives a U(1), SU(2) and U(3) gauge fields as well as a Higgs field. The\r
computation of A+JAJ−1removes a U(1) part from the above gauge fields (such\r
that the full matrix is traceless) (for derivation see [4]). The Dirac operator Dq\r
that takes the inner fluctuations into account is given by the 36×36 matrix (acting\r
on the 36 quarks) (tensored with Clifford algebras)\r

the field H.\r
It is a simple exercise to see that the action for the fermionic quark sector is given\r
by\r
(Q, Dq Q). (3.12)\r

Again the leptonic action have the simple form\r

According to our universal formula (1.28) the spectral action for the standard\r
model is given by:\r
Tr[χ(D2/m2\r

)] + (ψ, Dψ) (3.15)\r
where (ψ, Dψ) will include the quark sector (3.12) and the leptonic sector (3.14).\r

As explained in the last section this action has to be taken as the bare action at\r
some cutoff scale Λ. The renormalized action will have the same form as (3.20)\r
but with the bare quantities κ0, µ0, λ0, a0 to e0 and g01, g02, g03 replaced with\r
physical quantities.\r
Relations between the bare gauge coupling constants as well as equations (3.19)\r
have to be imposed as boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations\r

[13]. The bare mass of the Higgs field is related to the bare value of Newton’s\r
constant, and both have quadratic divergences in the limit of infinite cutoff Λ.\r

taken to be Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. There is, however, a slight disagreement (10%) between\r
the predicted value of sin2θw and the experimental value of 0.2325 known to a\r
very high precision. It is a remarkable fact that starting from the spectrum of\r
the standard model at low-energies, and assuming that this spectrum does not\r
change, one can get the geometrical spectral action which holds at very high\u0002energies and consistent within ten percent with experimental data. This can be\r
taken that at higher energies the noncommutative nature of space-time reveals\r
itself and shows that the effective theory at the scale Λ have a higher symmetry.\r
The other disagreement is that the gravity sector requires the cutoff scale to be of\r
the same order as the Planck scale while the condition on gauge coupling constants\r
give Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. The gravitational coupling G runs with Λ due to the matter\r
interactions. This dictates that it must be of the order Λ−2 and gives a large\r
value for Newton’s constant. These results must be taken as an indication that\r
the spectrum of the standard model has to be altered as we climb up in energy.\r
20

The change may happen at low energies (just as in supersymmetry which also\r
pushes the cutoff scale to 1016 Gev) or at some intermediate scale. Incidently the\r
porblem that Newton’s constant is coming out to be too large is also present in\r
string theroy where also a unification of gauge couplings and Newton’s constant\r
occurs [20]. Ultimately one would hope that modification of the spectrum will\r
increase the cutoff scale nearer to the Planck mass as dictated by gravity.\r
There is one further relation in our theory between the λ(H∗H)\r
2\r
coupling\r
and the gauge couplings to be imposed at the scale Λ [21]:\r
λ0 =\r

3\r
g\r

z\r
2\r
y\r

. (3.30)\r
This relation could be simplified if we assume that the top quark Yukawa coupling\r
is much larger than all the other Yukawa couplings. In this case equation (3.30)\r
simplifies to\r
λ(Λ) = 16π\r
3\r
α3(Λ). (3.31)\r
Therefore the value of λ at the unification scale is λ0 ≃ 0.402 showing that one\r
does not go outside the perturbation domain. In reality, equation (3.31) could be\r
used, together with the RG equations for λ and kt to determine the Higgs mass\r
at the low-energy scale MZ [22]:\r

These equations have to be integrated numerically [21]. One can get a rough\r
estimate on the Higgs mass from the triviality bound(∗) on the λ couplings. For\r
Λ ≃ 1015 Gev as given in equation (3.29) the limits are\r
160 < mH < 200 Gev . (3.34)\r
(∗) We like to thank M. Lindner for explanations on this point.\r
21

This together with the boundary condition (3.31) gives a mass of the Higgs\r
near the lower bound of 160 Gev. The exact answer can be only determined\r
by numerical integration, but this of course cannot be completely trusted as the\r
predicted value for sin2θw is off by ten percent. It can, however, be taken as an\r
approximate answer and in this respect one can say that the Higgs mass lies in\r
the interval 160 − 180 Gev. We expect this prediction to be correct to the same\r
precision as that of sin2θw in (3.29).\r
In reality we can perform the same analysis for the gravitational sector to deter\u0002mine the dependence of κ0, a0, b0, c0, d0 and e0 on the physical quantities and\r
the effect of the boundary conditions (3.19) on them. This, however, will not have\r
measurable consequences and will not be pursued here.\r
4. Conclusions.\r
The basic symmetry for a noncommutative space (A, H, D) is Aut(A). This\r
symmetry includes diffeomorphisms and internal symmetry transformations. The\r
bosonic action is a spectral function of the Dirac operator while the fermionic\r
action takes the simple linear form (ψ, Dψ) where ψ are spinors defined on the\r
Hilbert space. Applying this principle to the simple case where the algebra is\r
C∞(M)⊗Mn(C) with a Hilbert space of fermions in the adjoint representation one\r
finds that the bosonic action contains the Yang-Mills, Einstein and Weyl actions.\r
This action is to be interpreted as the bare Wilsonian action at some cutoff scale Λ.\r
The same principle when applied to the less trivial noncommutative geometry of\r
the standard model gives the standard model action coupled to Einstein and Weyl\r
gravity plus higher order non-renormalizable interactions supressed by powers of\r
the inverse of the mass scale in the theory. One also gets a mass term for the Higgs\r
field. This bare mass is of the same order as the cutoff scale and this is related\r
to the fact that there are quadratic divergences associated with the Higgs mass in\r
the standard model. There are some relations between the bare quantities. The\r
renormalized action will have the same form as the bare action but with physical\r
quantities replacing the bare ones (except for an R2term which is absent in the\r
bare action due to the scale invariance of the a4 term associated with the square\r
of the Dirac operator). The relations among the bare quantities must be taken as\r
boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations governing the scale\r
dependence of the physical quantities.\r
In particular there are relations among the gauge couplings coinciding with\r
22

those of SU(5) (or any gauge group containing SU(5) and also between the Higgs\r
couplings to be imposed at some scale. These relations give a unification scale\r
(or cutoff scale) of order ∼ 1015 Gev and a value for sin2θw ∼ 0.21 which is\r
off by ten percent from the true value. We also have a prediction of the Higgs\r
mass in the interval 160 − 180 Gev. This can be taken as an indication that the\r
noncommutative structure of space-time reveals itself at such high scale where the\r
effective action has a geometrical interpretation.\r
The slight disagreement with experiment indicates that the spectrum of the\r
standard model could not be extrapolated to very high energies without adding\r
new particles necessary to change the RG equations of the gauge couplings. One\r
possibility could be supersymmetry, but there could be also less drastic solutions.\r
It might be tempting by changing the spectrum to push the unification scale up\r
nearer to the Planck scale a situation which is also present in string theory.\r
In summary, we have succeeded in finding a universal action formula that\r
unified the standard model with the Einstein action. This necessarily involved an\r
extrapolation from the low-energy sector to 1015 Gev, assuming no new physics\r
arise. Our slight disagreement for the prediction of sin2θw and for the low value\r
of the unification scale seems to imply that the spectrum of the standard model\r
must be modified either at low-energy or at an intermediate scale. There is also\r
the possibility that by formulating the theory at very high energies, the concept\r
of space-time as a manifold breaks down and the noncommutativity of the algebra\r
must be extended to include the manifold part. One expects that the algebra A\r
becomes a finite dimensional algebra. Finally, we hope that our universal action\r
formula should be applicable to many situations of which the most important could\r
be superconformal field theory. Work along these ideas is now in progress.\r

Abstract.\r
We propose a new action principle to be associated with a noncommutative space (A, H, D). The universal formula for the spectral action is (ψ, Dψ) + Trace(χ(D/\r
Λ)) whereψ is a spinor on the Hilbert space, Λ is a scale andχ a positive func\u0002tion. When this principle is applied to the noncommutative space defined by the\r
spectrum of the standard model one obtains the standard model action coupled to\r
Einstein plus Weyl gravity. There are relations between the gauge coupling con\u0002stants identical to those of SU(5) as well as the Higgs self-coupling, to be taken\r
at a fixed high energy scale.\r

spin 1/2, the quarks and leptons.\r
These additional fields have a priori a very different status than the geometry\r

corresponding spectral triple (A, H, D). The points of M are recovered as the\r
characters of the involutive algebra A, i.e. as the homomorphisms ρ : A → C\r
(linear maps such that ρ(ab) = ρ(a) ρ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A). The geodesic distance\r
between points is recovered by\r
d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} . (1.5)\r
More importantly one can characterize the spectral triples (A, H, D) which come\r
from the above spinorial construction by very simple axioms ([4]) which involve\r
the dimension n of M. The parity of n implies a Z/2 grading γ of the Hilbert\r
space H such that,\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γa = aγ ∀ a ∈ A , γD = −Dγ . (1.6)\r
Moreover one keeps track of the real structure on H as an antilinear isometry J in\r
H satisfying simple relations\r
J\r
2 = ε , JD = ε′DJ , Jγ = ε′′γJ ; ε, ε′\r
, ε′′ ∈ {−1, 1} (1.7)\r
where the value of ε, ε′, ε′′ is determined by n modulo 8. One first virtue of these\r
axioms is to allow for a shift of point of view, similar to Fourier transform, in which\r
the usual emphasis on the points x ∈ M of a geometric space is now replaced by\r
the spectrum Σ ⊂ R of the operator D. Indeed, if one forgets about the algebra\r
A in the spectral triple (A, H, D) but retains only the operators D, γ and J\r
acting in H one can (using (1.7)) characterize this data by the spectrum Σ of D\r
which is a discrete subset with multiplicity of R. In the even case Σ = −Σ. The\r
existence of Riemannian manifolds which are isospectral (i.e. have the same Σ)\r
but not isometric shows that the following hypothesis is stronger than the usual\r
diffeomorphism invariance of the action of general relativity,\r
“The physical action only depends upon Σ .” (1.8)\r
In order to apply this principle to the action (1.2) we need to exploit a second\r
virtue of the axioms (cf. [4]) which is that they do not require the commutativity\r
of the algebra A. Instead one only needs the much weaker form,\r

In general the group Aut(A) of automorphisms of the involutive algebra A plays\r

Since AF is finite dimensional the dimension of the corresponding space is 0 so\r
that HF must be finite dimensional. The list of elementary fermions provides a\r
natural candidate for HF . One lets HF be the Hilbert space with basis labelled\r
by elementary leptons and quarks. Thus for the first generation of leptons we get\r
eL, eR, νL, e¯L, e¯R, ν¯L for instance, as the corresponding basis. The Z/2 grading γF\r
is given by +1 for left handed particles and −1 for right handed ones. For quarks\r
one has an additional color index, y, r, b. The involution J is just such that Jf = ¯f\r
for any f in the basis. One has J\r
2 = 1, Jγ = γJ as dictated by the dimension\r
n = 0. Moreover the algebra AF has a natural representation in HF and:\r

where Y is the Yukawa coupling matrix.\r
The special features of Y show that the algebraic rule\r
[[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A (1.22)\r
5

which is one of the essential axioms, holds for the spectral geometry (AF , HF , DF )\r
= F. Of course this 0-dimensional geometry is encoding the knowledge of the\r
fermions of the standard model and it is a basic question to understand and char\u0002acterize it abstractly, but let us postpone this problem and proceed with the\r
product geometry M × F.\r
The next important new feature of the noncommutative case is the following. We\r
saw that the group Aut(A) of diffeomorphisms falls in equivalence classes under\r
the normal subgroup Int(A) of inner automorphisms. In the same way the space of\r
metrics has a natural foliation into equivalence classes. The internal fluctuations\r
of a given metric are given by the formula,\r
D = D0 + A + JAJ−1, A = Σ ai[D0, bi] , ai, bi ∈ A and A = A\r
∗\r
. (1.23)\r
Thus starting from (A, H, D0) with obvious notations, one leaves the representa\u0002tion of A in H untouched and just perturbs the operator D0 by (1.23) where A is\r
an arbitrary self-adjoint operator in H of the form A = Σ ai[D0, bi] ; ai, bi ∈ A.\r
One checks that this does not alter the axioms (check (1.22) for instance). These\r
fluctuations are trivial: D = D0 in the usual Riemannian case in the same way as\r
the group of inner automorphisms Int(A) = {1} is trivial for A = C∞(M).\r
In general the natural action of Int( f A) on the space of metrics restricts to the\r
above equivalence classes and is simply given by (for the automorphism associated\r
to u ∈ A, uu∗ = u\r
∗u = 1),\r
ξ ∈ H → uξu∗ = uu∗0ξ , A → u[D, u∗] + uAu∗. (1.24)\r
When one computes the internal fluctuations of the above product geometry M×F\r
one finds ([6]) that they are parametrized exactly by the bosons γ, W±, Z, the eight\r
gluons and the Higgs fields H of the standard model. The equality\r
Z\r
M\r
(LGf + LHf )\r
√\r
g d4x = hψ, Dψi (1.25)\r
gives the contribution to (1.2) of the last two term of the SM Lagrangian in terms\r
of the operator D alone.\r
The operator D encodes the metric of our “discrete Kaluza Klein” geometry M ×F\r
but this metric is no longer the product metric as it was for D0. In fact the initial\r
scale given by DF completely disappears when one considers the arbitrary internal\r
fluctuations of D0 = ∂/M ⊗1+γ5 ⊗DF . What remains is to understand in a purely\r
6

gravitational manner the 4 remaining terms of the action (1.2). This is where we\r
apply the basic principle (1.8).\r
We shall check in this paper that for any smooth cutoff function χ, χ(λ) = 1 for\r
|λ| ≤ 1, one has\r
Trace χ\r
\u0012\r
D\r
Λ\r
\u0013\r
= IE + IG + IGH + IH + IC + 0(Λ−∞) (1.26)\r
where IC is a sum of a cosmological term, a term of Weyl gravity and a term in\r
R\r
R H2 √g d4x. The computation in itself is not new, and goes back to the work\r
of DeWitt [7]. Similar computations also occur in the theory of induced gravity\r
[8]. It is clear that the left hand side of (1.26) only depends upon the spectrum\r
Σ of the operator D, and following our principle (1.8) this allows to take it as the\r
natural candidate for the bare action at the cutoff scale Λ.\r
In our framework there is a natural way to cutoff the geometry at a given energy\r
scale Λ, which has been developed in [9] for some concrete examples. It consists\r
in replacing the Hilbert space H by the subspace HΛ,\r
HΛ = range χ\r
\u0012\r
D\r
Λ\r
\u0013\r
(1.27)\r
and restricting both D and A to this subspace, while maintaining the commutation\r
rule (1.20) for the algebra A. This procedure is superior to the familiar lattice\r
approximation because it does respect the geometric symmetry group. The point\r
is that finite dimensional noncommutative algebras have continuous Lie groups of\r
automorphisms while the automorphism group of a commutative finite dimensional\r
algebra is necessarily finite. The hypothesis which we shall test in this paper is\r
that there exist an energy scale Λ in the range 1015 − 1019 Gev at which the bare\r
action (1.2) becomes geometric, i.e. ∼\r

As explained in the last section this action has to be taken as the bare action at\r
some cutoff scale Λ. The renormalized action will have the same form as (3.20)\r
but with the bare quantities κ0, µ0, λ0, a0 to e0 and g01, g02, g03 replaced with\r
physical quantities.\r
Relations between the bare gauge coupling constants as well as equations (3.19)\r
have to be imposed as boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations\r

[13]. The bare mass of the Higgs field is related to the bare value of Newton’s\r
constant, and both have quadratic divergences in the limit of infinite cutoff Λ.\r

0.206 ≤ sin2θw ≤ 0.210 . (3.29)\r
Therefore the bare action we obtained and associated with the spectrum of the\r
standard model is consistent with experimental data provided the cutoff scale is\r
taken to be Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. There is, however, a slight disagreement (10%) between\r
the predicted value of sin2θw and the experimental value of 0.2325 known to a\r
very high precision. It is a remarkable fact that starting from the spectrum of\r
the standard model at low-energies, and assuming that this spectrum does not\r
change, one can get the geometrical spectral action which holds at very high\u0002energies and consistent within ten percent with experimental data. This can be\r
taken that at higher energies the noncommutative nature of space-time reveals\r
itself and shows that the effective theory at the scale Λ have a higher symmetry.\r
The other disagreement is that the gravity sector requires the cutoff scale to be of\r
the same order as the Planck scale while the condition on gauge coupling constants\r
give Λ ∼ 1015 Gev. The gravitational coupling G runs with Λ due to the matter\r
interactions. This dictates that it must be of the order Λ−2 and gives a large\r
value for Newton’s constant. These results must be taken as an indication that\r
the spectrum of the standard model has to be altered as we climb up in energy."""

pushes the cutoff scale to 1016 Gev) or at some intermediate scale. Incidently the\r
porblem that Newton’s constant is coming out to be too large is also present in\r
string theroy where also a unification of gauge couplings and Newton’s constant\r
occurs [20]. Ultimately one would hope that modification of the spectrum will\r
increase the cutoff scale nearer to the Planck mass as dictated by gravity.\r

simplifies to\r
λ(Λ) = 16π\r

α3(Λ). (3.31)\r
Therefore the value of λ at the unification scale is λ0 ≃ 0.402 showing that one\r

The basic symmetry for a noncommutative space (A, H, D) is Aut(A). This\r
symmetry includes diffeomorphisms and internal symmetry transformations. The\r
bosonic action is a spectral function of the Dirac operator while the fermionic\r
action takes the simple linear form (ψ, Dψ) where ψ are spinors defined on the\r
Hilbert space. Applying this principle to the simple case where the algebra is\r
C∞(M)⊗Mn(C) with a Hilbert space of fermions in the adjoint representation one\r
finds that the bosonic action contains the Yang-Mills, Einstein and Weyl actions.\r
This action is to be interpreted as the bare Wilsonian action at some cutoff scale Λ.\r
The same principle when applied to the less trivial noncommutative geometry of\r
the standard model gives the standard model action coupled to Einstein and Weyl\r
gravity plus higher order non-renormalizable interactions supressed by powers of\r
the inverse of the mass scale in the theory. One also gets a mass term for the Higgs\r
field. This bare mass is of the same order as the cutoff scale and this is related\r
to the fact that there are quadratic divergences associated with the Higgs mass in\r
the standard model. There are some relations between the bare quantities. The\r
renormalized action will have the same form as the bare action but with physical\r
quantities replacing the bare ones (except for an R2term which is absent in the\r
bare action due to the scale invariance of the a4 term associated with the square\r
of the Dirac operator). The relations among the bare quantities must be taken as\r
boundary conditions on the renormalization group equations governing the scale\r
dependence of the physical quantities.\r
In particular there are relations among the gauge couplings coinciding with\r
22

those of SU(5) (or any gauge group containing SU(5) and also between the Higgs\r
couplings to be imposed at some scale. These relations give a unification scale\r
(or cutoff scale) of order ∼ 1015 Gev and a value for sin2θw ∼ 0.21 which is\r
off by ten percent from the true value. We also have a prediction of the Higgs\r
mass in the interval 160 − 180 Gev. This can be taken as an indication that the\r
noncommutative structure of space-time reveals itself at such high scale where the\r
effective action has a geometrical interpretation.\r
The slight disagreement with experiment indicates that the spectrum of the\r
standard model could not be extrapolated to very high energies without adding\r
new particles necessary to change the RG equations of the gauge couplings. One\r
possibility could be supersymmetry, but there could be also less drastic solutions.\r
It might be tempting by changing the spectrum to push the unification scale up\r
nearer to the Planck scale a situation which is also present in string theory.\r
In summary, we have succeeded in finding a universal action formula that\r
unified the standard model with the Einstein action. This necessarily involved an\r
extrapolation from the low-energy sector to 1015 Gev, assuming no new physics\r
arise. Our slight disagreement for the prediction of sin2θw and for the low value\r
of the unification scale seems to imply that the spectrum of the standard model\r
must be modified either at low-energy or at an intermediate scale. There is also\r
the possibility that by formulating the theory at very high energies, the concept\r
of space-time as a manifold breaks down and the noncommutativity of the algebra\r
must be extended to include the manifold part. One expects that the algebra A\r
becomes a finite dimensional algebra. Finally, we hope that our universal action\r
formula should be applicable to many situations of which the most important could\r
be superconformal field theory. Work along these ideas is now in progress.\r
