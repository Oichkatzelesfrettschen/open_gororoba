THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE\r
DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Abstract. We present some data on the cohomology of the motivic Steenrod\r
algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Our results are\r
based on computer calculations and a motivic version of the May spectral\r
sequence. We discuss features of the associated Adams spectral sequence,\r
and use these tools to give new proofs of some results in classical algebraic\r
topology. We also consider a motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. The\r
investigations reveal the existence of some stable motivic homotopy classes\r
that have no classical analogue.\r
1. Introduction\r
In modern algebraic geometry one studies varieties defined over arbitrary fields,\r
whereas classically this was done over only the real or complex numbers. The\r
subject of motivic homotopy theory is an attempt to generalize algebraic topology\r
in the same way; rather than study standard topological spaces, one studies a\r
category of “spaces” defined over a fixed ground field. The subject was put on firm\r
foundations by the paper [MV], and it encompasses several areas of study like ´etale\r
cohomology and algebraic K-theory.\r
One of the things that came out of [MV] was the realization that almost any\r
object studied in classical algebraic topology could be given a motivic analog. In\r
particular, one could define the motivic stable homotopy groups of spheres. The\r
present paper begins an investigation of the Adams spectral sequence, based on mod\r
2 motivic cohomology, that abuts to these groups. Our results not only contribute\r
to the study of motivic phenomena, but we find that they can be used to prove\r
theorems about the classical stable homotopy groups as well.\r
In the motivic stable homotopy category (over a given field) there is a bigraded\r
family of spheres S\r
p,q. It follows that one has a bigraded family of stable homo\u0002topy groups πp,q(X) for any motivic spectrum X, and consequently all generalized\r
homology and cohomology theories are bigraded. For the sphere spectrum S, we\r
will abbreviate πp,q(S) to just πp,q.\r
The object S\r
n,0\r
is like an ordinary sphere, and smashing with it models the\r
n-fold suspension in the triangulated structure. The object S\r
1,1\r
is the suspension\r
spectrum of the scheme A\r
1 − 0, and represents a ‘geometric’ circle. The other\r
spheres are obtained by smashing together copies of S\r
1,1 and S1,0\r
, and taking\r
formal desuspensions. One should take from this that the groups πp,0 are most like\r
the classical stable homotopy groups, whereas the groups πp,q for q > 0 somehow\r
contain more geometric information. We will see this idea again in Remark 4.3.\r

The current knowledge about the groups πp,q is due to work of Morel. It follows\r
from results in [M3] that πp,q = 0 for p < q. In [M2] it is shown that the groups\r
πn,n can be completely described in terms of generators and relations using the\r
Milnor-Witt K-theory of the ground field. This theorem of Morel is in some sense\r
a motivic analog of the classical computation of the stable 0-stem.\r
Let F be a field of characteristic zero, and let M2 denote the bigraded motivic\r
cohomology ring of Spec F, with Z/2-coefficients. Let A be the mod 2 motivic\r
Steenrod algebra over F. All of these notions will be reviewed in Section 2 below.\r
The motivic Adams spectral sequence is a tri-graded spectral sequence with\r
E\r
s,t,u\r
2 = Exts,(t+s,u)\r
A (M2, M2),\r
and dr : Es,t,u\r
r → Es+r,t−1,ur\r
. Here s is the homological degree of the Ext group (the\r
Adams filtration), and (t+s, u) is the internal bigrading coming from the bigrading\r
on A and M2: so t+s is the topological dimension and u is the motivic weight. The\r
spectral sequence was first studied in the paper [M1]. It converges to something\r
related to the stable motivic homotopy group πt,u; see Corollary 7.15 for a precise\r
statement.\r
The motivic Steenrod algebra A is very similar to the classical mod 2 Steenrod\r
algebra, but the action of A on M2 is nontrivial in general. This extra feature\r
seriously complicates the computation of the Ext groups in the Adams E2-term. If\r
the ground field F contains a square root of −1, however, the action of A on M2\r
is trivial and the Ext groups are much more accessible. This is the situation that\r
we study in the present paper. In fact, for added convenience we almost entirely\r
restrict to the case of algebraically closed fields.\r
One goal of this paper is to present some computer calculations of the E2-term\r
of the motivic Adams spectral sequence. We have carried out the computations far\r
enough to discover several exotic elements that have no classical analogues.\r
By the usual ‘Lefschetz principle’, the Adams spectral sequence over any alge\u0002braically closed field of characteristic zero takes the same form as over the complex\r
numbers. One might as well restrict to this case. But over the complex numbers,\r
there is a map from the (tri-graded) motivic Adams spectral sequence to the (bi\u0002graded) classical one. Comparing the two spectral sequences allows information to\r
pass in both directions. On the one hand, we can deduce motivic differentials from\r
knowledge of the classical differentials. We can also turn this around, though, and\r
use the algebra of the motivic E2-term to prove results about classical differentials,\r
and about extension problems as well. This is described further in Sections 6.2\r
and 8.8 below. We stress that these methods are purely algebraic; as soon as one\r
knows the motivic spectral sequence exists, and can do the related algebraic calcu\u0002lations, some results about the classical Adams spectral sequence come out almost\r
for free.\r
It is useful to keep in mind the analogy of mixed Hodge theory and its influence\r
on topological gadgets like the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. Once it is known that\r
the Leray-Serre differentials preserve the Hodge weight, these differentials become\r
easier to analyze—there are fewer places where they can be nontrivial. A similar\r
thing happens with the Adams spectral sequence and the motivic weight. The three\u0002dimensional nature of the motivic Adams spectral sequence allows the nontrivial\r
groups to be more spread out, and also allows the algebra of Massey products to\r
work out in slightly different ways than the classical story. As a result, certain

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 3\r
purely topological phenomena become easier to analyze. So far this technique\r
has only yielded results of casual interest, but a more thorough study in higher\r
dimensions might be fruitful.\r
Throughout the article, we are considering only the situation where the ground\r
field is algebraically closed and has characteristic 0. The latter assumption is ab\u0002solutely necessary at the moment, as the motivic Steenrod algebra is unknown\r
over fields of positive characteristic. The assumption that the ground field is al\u0002gebraically closed is less crucial. It is very easy to extend from the algebraically\r
closed case to the case where the ground field contains a square root of −1; see\r
Remark 6.1. When considering fields which do not contain such a square root,\r
however, the difficulty of the calculations increases dramatically. A future paper\r
[DHI] will deal with this more general case.\r
Remark 1.1. In this paper we only deal with the motivic Adams spectral sequence\r
based on mod 2 motivic cohomology. Most aspects of our discussion also work at\r
odd primes, but the motivic Steenrod algebra in that case is exactly isomorphic\r
to the classical Steenrod algebra—the only difference being the existence of the\r
extra grading by weights. The E2-term of the odd primary motivic Adams spectral\r
sequence therefore takes the same form as it does classically.\r
1.2. Organization of the paper. In the first two sections we introduce the rel\u0002evant background and set up the cohomological Adams spectral sequence. (It is\r
probably better to work with the homological Adams spectral sequence, but work\u0002ing cohomologically allows us to postpone some motivic issues to later in the pa\u0002per.) Then we discuss basic properties of the motivic Ext groups and give the\r
computation of the Adams E2-term for t ≤ 34. Next we show how to derive this\r
computation by hand with the motivic May spectral sequence. Then we make some\r
simple computations of differentials, and use this to prove a theorem in classical\r
topology (Proposition 6.3).\r
In Section 7 we turn to convergence issues, and prove that our Adams spec\u0002tral sequence converges to the homotopy groups of the H-nilpotent completion\r
S\r
∧\r
H of the sphere spectrum, where H is the motivic mod 2 Eilenberg-Mac Lane\r
spectrum. This entails dealing with the homological Adams spectral sequence and\r
related material. Section 8 discusses the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence,\r
first studied in [HKO], and uses this to deduce further differentials in the motivic\r
Adams spectral sequence. From this information we then prove a second theorem\r
in classical topology, namely Proposition 8.9.\r
The appendices contain charts of the motivic Adams spectral sequence, the mo\u0002tivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the E4-term of the motivic May spec\u0002tral sequence. These charts are best viewed in color.\r
1.3. Notation and terminology. The following notation is used in the paper:\r
(1) M2 is the mod 2 motivic cohomology of a point (i.e., the ground field).\r
(2) A is the mod 2 motivic Steenrod algebra.\r
(3) H∗,∗(−) is mod 2 motivic cohomology.\r
(4) H is the mod 2 motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum.\r

s,t → S0,0\r
.\r

We are working implicitly with appropriate model categories of spectra and\r
of motivic spectra. The categories of symmetric spectra [HSS] and of motivic\r
symmetric spectra [J] will work fine.\r
Several times in the paper we use without comment the fact that the spheres\r
are compact objects of the motivic stable homotopy category. That is, if ∨αEα is\r
a wedge of motivic spectra, then ⊕α[S\r
p,q, Eα] → [Sp,q\r
, ∨αEα] is an isomorphism.\r
In fact this is true not just for spheres, but for all suspension spectra of smooth\r
schemes; this is proven in [DI2, Section 9].\r

2. Background\r
In this section we review the basic facts about motivic cohomology and motivic\r
Steenrod operations.\r
2.1. The cohomology of a point. Let F be a field of characteristic 0. We write\r
M2 for the bigraded cohomology ring H∗,∗(Spec F; Z/2). A theorem of Voevodsky\r
[V1] describes M2 explicitly in terms of the Milnor K-theory of F. Unfortunately\r
this result doesn’t have a simple reference, and instead is a confluence of Corollary\r
6.9(2), Theorem 6.1, and Corollary 6.10 of [V1]. Unless otherwise stated, we will\r
always assume in this paper that F is algebraically closed. For such fields the\r
description of M2 has a particularly simple form:\r
Theorem 2.2 (Voevodsky). The bigraded ring M2 is the polynomial ring F2[τ] on\r
one generator τ of bidegree (0, 1).\r
In a bidegree (p, q), we shall refer to p as the topological degree and q as the\r
weight.\r
2.3. The motivic Steenrod algebra. We write A for the ring of stable cohomol\u0002ogy operations on mod 2 motivic cohomology. Voevodsky has computed this ring\r
explicitly for fields of characteristic zero: see [V2, Section 11] and [V3, Theorem\r
1.4]. In general, the ring is generated over M2 by the Steenrod operations Sqi. Note\r
that Sq2klies in bidegree (2k, k), whereas Sq2k−1lies in bidegree (2k − 1, k − 1).\r
These operations satisfy a complicated version of the Adem relations. Again, the\r
description simplifies quite a bit when the ground field is algebraically closed:\r
Theorem 2.4 (Voevodsky). The motivic Steenrod algebra A is the M2-algebra\r
generated by elements Sq2kand Sq2k−1for all k ≥ 1, of bidegrees (2k, k) and\r
(2k − 1, k − 1) respectively, and satisfying the following relations for a < 2b:\r
SqaSqb =\r
X\r
c\r
\u0012\r
b − 1 − c\r
a − 2c\r
\u0013\r
τ\r
? Sqa+b−c\r
Sqc.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 5\r
Note the coefficients τ\r
?\r
in the Adem relation above. Here the “?” denotes an\r
exponent which is either 0 or 1. We could explicitly write the exponent, but only at\r
the expense of making the formula appear more unwieldy. The exponent is easily\r
determined in practice, because it is precisely what is needed in order to make the\r
formula homogeneous in the bidegree.\r
For example, consider the formula Sq2Sq2 = τ\r
? Sq3\r
Sq1. Since Sq2has bidegree\r
(2, 1), the left side has total bidegree (4, 2). On the other hand, Sq1has bidegree\r
(1, 0) and Sq3has bidegree (3, 1), so we require one τ on the right side in order\r
to make the formula homogeneous. In other words, we have the motivic Adem\r
relation Sq2Sq2 = τ Sq3Sq1. It turns out this is representative of what happens in\r
all the motivic Adem relations: the τ appears precisely when a and b are even and\r
c is odd.\r
The Steenrod operations act on the motivic cohomology H∗,∗(X) of any smooth\r
scheme X. In particular, they act on the cohomology of Spec F. In our case, where\r
F is algebraically closed, M2 is concentrated entirely in topological degree 0. It\r
follows that the Steenrod operations (other than the identity) act trivially on M2\r
for dimension reasons.\r
Just as in the classical situation, the admissible monomials form a basis for A\r
as an M2-module [S] [MT].\r
2.5. The Milnor basis. A theorem of Voevodsky gives an explicit description\r
of the dual of A [V2]. As an algebra A∗ can be described as the subalgebra\r
M2[ζi, τ −1ζ\r
2\r
i\r
]i≥1 ⊆ M2[τ\r
−1\r
, ζ1, ζ2, . . .]. Here τ has (homological) bidegree (0, −1)\r
and ζi has bidegree (2i − 1, 2\r
i−1 − 1).\r
The elements τ\r
−1\r
ζ\r
2\r
i\r
are indecomposable in A, but their names are a useful way\r
of encoding the relation (ζi)\r
2 = τ · τ−1\r
ζ\r
2\r
i\r
. In the notation of [V2], ζi corresponds\r
to τi and τ\r
−1\r
ζ\r
2\r
i\r
corresponds to ξi+1. Under the canonical map A∗ → Acl\r
∗\r
to the\r
classical dual Steenrod algebra—see Section 2.6 below—the element ζi maps to ξi\r
and τ\r
−1\r
ζ\r
2\r
i maps to ξ\r
2\r
i\r
.\r
The comultiplication on A∗ is identical to the comultiplication on the classical\r
Steenrod algebra [Mi], except that appropriate powers of τ must be inserted to\r
make the formulas homogeneous in the bidegree. Namely, the coproduct on ζk\r
takes the form P\r
i\r
τ\r
?\r
ζ\r
2\r
i\r
k−i ⊗ ζi\r
.\r
There is an evident basis for A∗ as an M2-module consisting of monomials\r
τ\r
?\r
ζ\r
r1\r
1\r
ζ\r
r2\r
2\r
· · · . Here ? is the smallest power of τ that gives an expression lying in\r
A∗, namely −\r
P\r
i\r
⌊\r
ri\r
2\r
⌋. Just as in the classical situation, this basis for A∗ yields\r
a dual basis for A (as an M2-module) called the Milnor basis. The Milnor basis\r
consists of elements of the form P\r
R, where R = (r1, r2, . . .) ranges over all finite\r
sequences of non-negative integers. Here P\r
R is dual to τ?\r
ζ\r
r1\r
1\r
ζ\r
r2\r
2\r
. . .. The bidegree\r
of P\r
R is easily calculated, and equals\r
\u0012Xri(2i − 1),\r
X\u0016\r
ri(2i − 1)\r
2\r
\u0017\u0013 .\r
Products P\r
RPS can be computed with matrices and multinomial coefficients just\r
as in [Mi], except that some terms require a power of τ as a coefficient. Similarly\r
to the motivic Adem relations, these coefficients are easy to calculate; they are\r
exactly what are needed in order to make the formulas homogeneous in the bidegree.\r
However, unlike the Adem relations, it is sometimes necessary to use exponents

greater than one. (The first occurrence of τ\r
2\r
in these formulas occurs in topological\r
dimension 26.)\r
We make use of the Milnor basis in Section 5 when we discuss the motivic May\r
spectral sequence. Also, some of our computer calculations use this basis.\r
2.6. Comparison with the classical Steenrod algebra. There is a topological\r
realization functor from motivic spectra over C to ordinary spectra, as described\r
in [MV] [DI1]. This functor is uniquely determined (up to homotopy) by the fact\r
that it preserves homotopy colimits and weak equivalences, and sends the motivic\r
suspension spectrum of a smooth scheme X to the ordinary suspension spectrum of\r
its topological space of complex-valued points X(C). We generalize this notation,\r
so that if E is any motivic spectrum then E(C) denotes its topological realization.\r
Let H be the mod 2 motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, i.e., the motivic\r
spectrum that represents mod 2 motivic cohomology. It follows from [V3, Lemma\r
4.36] that H(C) is the classical mod 2 Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum Hcl. So topo\u0002logical realization induces natural transformations Hp,q(X) → Hp\r
(X(C)) denoted\r
α 7→ α(C). We implicitly consider H∗(X(C)) to be a bigraded object concentrated\r
in weight 0.\r
Definition 2.7. For any motivic spectrum X, let\r
θX : H∗,∗(X) ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] → H∗(X(C)) ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
]\r
be the M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-linear map that takes a class α of weight w in H∗,∗(X) to τ\r
wα(C).\r
In order for θX to be well-defined, we must observe that τ(C) equals 1 in the\r
singular cohomology of a point. This follows by splitting the topological realization\r
map into two pieces\r
Hp,q(Spec C) → H\r
p\r
et(Spec C; µ\r
⊗q\r
2\r
) → H\r
p\r
sing(Spec C)\r
where the group in the middle is ´etale cohomology. For p ≤ q the first map is an\r
isomorphism by [V1], and it is a classical result of Grothendieck and his collabora\u0002tors [SGA4, XI] that the second map is an isomorphism. In particular, this holds\r
when p = 0 and q = 1. Since the group in question is Z/2, it must be that τ maps\r
to 1.\r
Lemma 2.8. The map θX is an isomorphism of bigraded M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-modules if X is\r
the motivic sphere spectrum or if X is the motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum.\r
In the following proof, we write Acl for the classical topological mod 2 Steenrod\r
algebra.\r
Proof. This follows directly from the description of the motivic cohomology of a\r
point and of the motivic Steenrod algebra.\r
For the sphere spectrum, θX is just the map M2 ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] → F2 ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
],\r
which is obviously an isomorphism.\r
For the motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, note that H∗,∗(X) is the motivic\r
Steenrod algebra, and H∗(X(C)) is the classical topological Steenrod algebra. The\r
map θX takes Sq2kto τ\r
−k Sq2k\r
, and takes Sq2k+1 to τ\r
−k Sq2k+1. But we have\r
that A ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] is free as an M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-module on the admissible monomials.\r
Also, Acl ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] is free as an M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-module on the admissible monomials.\r
It follows that θX is an isomorphism. \u0003

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 7\r
Corollary 2.9. The map A ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] → Acl ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] that takes Sq2kto\r
τ\r
−k Sq2k\r
and takes Sq2k−1to τ\r
−k Sq2k−1\r
is an isomorphism of bigraded rings.\r
Proof. This follows immediately from Lemma 2.8. \u0003\r
Before giving the final lemmas of this section we need a brief discussion of a\r
finite type condition. For the remainder of this subsection we work over a general\r
field F (not necessarily algebraically closed).\r
Definition 2.10. Given an element x of bidegree (p, q) in a bigraded group, the\r
Chow weight C(x) of x is the integer 2q − p.\r
The terminology is motivated by the fact that 2q − p is a natural index in the\r
higher Chow group perspective on motivic cohomology [Bl]. It is known that the\r
mod 2 motivic cohomology groups Hp,q(X) of any smooth scheme are concentrated\r
in non-negative Chow weight and also in the range p ≥ 0 (see [MVW, Thm. 19.3]\r
and [V1, Thm. 7.8]).\r
Definition 2.11. Let {nα = (pα, qα)}α∈S be a set of bidegrees. This set is mo\u0002tivically finite type if for any α in S, there are only finitely many β in S such\r
that pα ≥ pβ and 2qα − pα ≥ 2qβ − pβ.\r
For example, this condition is satisfied if:\r
(i) the pα’s are bounded below, and\r
(ii) for each α, there are only finitely many β’s for which pβ = pα and qβ ≤ qα.\r
Definition 2.12. Let X be a motivic spectrum. A wedge of suspensions ∨α∈SΣ\r
nα X\r
is motivically finite type if the index set of bidegrees is motivically finite type.\r
Likewise, a free graded module over M2 is motivically finite type if it is of the\r
form ⊕α∈SΣ\r
nαM2 for a motivically finite type index set of bidegrees.\r
Lemma 2.13. For any smooth scheme X and any motivically finite type index set\r
of bidegrees {nα}α∈S, the canonical map\r
M\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(X) →\r
Y\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(X)\r
is an isomorphism. Here Σ\r
nα denotes the algebraic shifting of bigraded modules.\r
Proof. The motivically finite type condition guarantees that in each bidegree, only\r
finitely many terms of the product are nonzero. \u0003\r
Lemma 2.14. Let X belong to the smallest triangulated category of motivic spectra\r
that contains the spheres and motivically finite type wedges of suspensions of the\r
mod 2 motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum H. Then θX is an isomorphism.\r
Proof. Let C be the full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category con\u0002sisting of all motivic spectra A such that θA is an isomorphism. It is clear that C is\r
closed under suspensions and cofiber sequences, and by Lemma 2.8 C contains the\r
sphere spectrum and H. It only remains to show that C contains all motivically\r
finite type wedges of H.\r
Let W = ∨αΣ\r
nα H be a motivically finite type wedge of suspensions of H. Then\r
H∗,∗(W) = Q\r
α Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(H), and by Lemma 2.13 this equals ⊕αΣ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(H) as\r
modules over M2. We may then distribute the direct sum over the tensors that\r
appear in the definition of θW , and conclude that θW is an isomorphism based on\r
the fact that θH is. \u0003

where each Kiis a motivically finite type wedge of suspensions of H, Xi → Ki\r
is surjective on mod 2 motivic cohomology, and Xi+1 is the homotopy fiber of\r
Xi → Ki. Applying π∗,u gives us an exact couple—one for each u—and therefore\r
a Z-graded family of spectral sequences indexed by u. The usual arguments show\r
that the E2-term is Exts,(t+s,u)\r
A (M2, M2) and that the spectral sequence abuts to\r
something related to the stable motivic homotopy group πt,u.\r
Remark 3.1. In Section 7 we will prove that the spectral sequence converges to the\r
homotopy groups of the H-nilpotent completion of the sphere spectrum S, denoted\r
S\r
∧\r
H. We will also discuss the H-homology version of this tower, in which each Ki\r
is\r
replaced by Xi ∧ H. Both of these discussions involve some technicalities that we\r
wish to avoid for the moment.\r

Proposition 3.3. Let f : Xi → Ki be one of the maps in the motivic Adams reso\u0002lution. The map f(C) : X(C) → K(C) is surjective on mod 2 singular cohomology.\r
Proof. We know that the map H∗,∗(Ki) → H∗,∗(Xi) is surjective, so the map\r
H∗,∗(Ki) ⊗M2 M2[τ\r

] → H∗(Xi(C)) ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] is surjective, since θKi and θXi\r
are isomorphisms by Lemma 2.14. Restriction to weight zero shows that the map\r
H∗(Ki(C)) → H∗(Xi(C)) is surjective. \u0003\r
Topological realization gives natural maps πp,q(Z) → πp(Z(C)) for any motivic\r
spectrum Z, so that we get a map from the homotopy exact couple of (X, K) to\r
that of (X(C), K(C)). In this way we obtain a map of spectral sequences from the\r
motivic Adams spectral sequence for the motivic sphere spectrum to the classical\r
Adams spectral sequence for the classical sphere spectrum.\r
3.4. Comparison of Ext groups. Our next task is to compare Ext groups over\r
the motivic Steenrod algebra A to Ext groups over the classical Steenrod algebra\r
Acl.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 9\r
Note that Ext0,∗\r
A\r
(M2, M2) = Hom∗\r
A(M2, M2) = F2[˜τ ] where ˜τ is the dual of τ\r
and has bidegree (0, −1). We will abuse notation and often just write τ instead of\r
τ˜, but we will consistently write M˜\r
2 for F2[˜τ ].\r
For fixed s and t, Exts,(t+s,∗)\r
A\r
(M2, M2) is an M˜\r
2-module; it therefore decomposes\r
as a sum of free modules and modules of the form M˜\r
2/τk\r
. The following result\r
shows that the free part coincides with Ext over the classical Steenrod algebra.\r
Proposition 3.5. There is an isomorphism of rings\r
ExtA(M2, M2) ⊗M˜ 2 M˜\r
2[τ\r
−1\r
] ∼= ExtAcl (F2, F2) ⊗F2 F2[τ, τ −1].\r
Proof. Throughout the proof, we use that M2 → M2[τ\r
−1\r
] and F2 → F2[τ, τ −1] are\r
flat, so that the associated tensor product functors are exact.\r
There is a natural isomorphism\r
HomAcl (F2, −) ⊗F2 F2[τ, τ −1] → HomAcl⊗F2\r
F2[τ,τ−1](F2[τ, τ −1\r
],(−) ⊗F2 F2[τ, τ −1]),\r
so the induced map on derived functors is also an isomorphism. In particular, we\r
obtain an isomorphism\r
ExtAcl (F2, F2) ⊗F2 F2[τ, τ −1] → ExtAcl⊗F2\r
F2[τ,τ−1](F2[τ, τ −1\r
], F2[τ, τ −1]).\r
Recall from Corollary 2.9 that A[τ\r
−1\r
] is isomorphic to Acl ⊗F2 F2[τ, τ −1], so it\r
remains to show that there is an isomorphism\r
ExtA(M2, M2) ⊗M˜ 2 M˜\r
2[τ\r
−1\r
] → ExtA[τ−1](M2[τ\r
−1\r
], M2[τ\r
−1\r
]).\r
As in the previous paragraph, this follows from the natural isomorphism\r
HomA(M2, −) ⊗M˜ 2 M˜\r
2[τ\r
−1\r
] → HomA[τ−1](M2[τ\r
−1\r
],(−) ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
]).\r
\u0003\r
4. Computation of ExtA(M2, M2)\r
In this section we are concerned with computing the groups Exts,(t+s,u)\r
A (M2, M2),\r
which we abbreviate to Exts,(t+s,u). Here s is the homological degree, and (t+s, u)\r
is the internal bidegree. Recall that t + s corresponds to the usual topological\r
grading in the classical Steenrod algebra, and u is the motivic weight.\r
A chart showing the motivic Ext groups is given in Appendix A. There are\r
several things about the chart we must explain, however. First, the reader should\r
view these pictures as a projection of a three-dimensional grid, where the u axis\r
comes out of the page. Although our diagrams suppress this third direction, it is\r
always important to keep track of the weights. Our two-dimensional charts are\r
drawn using the classical conventions, so that t is on the horizontal axis and s is\r
on the vertical axis. We refer to t as the stem and s as the Adams filtration. Note\r
that column t of the chart contains groups related to πt,∗.\r
Recall from Section 3.4 that Ext0,(∗,∗)is the algebra M˜\r
2, i.e., a polynomial\r
algebra over F2 with one generator τ in bidegree (0, −1). The Yoneda product makes\r
Ext∗,(∗,∗)into a graded module over Ext0,(∗,∗). Therefore, Ext∗,(∗,∗)decomposes\r
into a direct sum of copies of M˜\r
2 and M˜2/τk\r
. It turns out that in the range\r
t − s ≤ 34, the only value of k for which the latter occurs is k = 1.\r
In our chart, each black circle represents a copy of M˜\r
2. The small numbers in\r
the chart indicate the weights of the generators of some of these copies (the weights\r
of the rest of the generators are implied by the multiplicative structure).

10 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Each red circle represents a copy of M˜\r
2/τ. Note that this submodule is concen\u0002trated in a single weight, which is either given or implied. By Proposition 3.5, if\r
we delete the red circles from our chart, the black circles correspond precisely to\r
the classical Ext chart [R, Appendix 3].\r
The results in this section were obtained by computer calculations. The software\r
computed a resolution for M2 over A, and from this information extracted Ext\r
groups and product information in the usual way. In the range t − s ≤ 34, the\r
computations have been checked by two independent software packages, and have\r
been further corroborated by work with the May spectral sequence described in\r
Section 5.\r
The software computed a minimal free resolution over the graded ring A. In\r
the classical case one computes Ext by applying HomA(−, F2), which makes all the\r
differentials vanish. In the motivic case we are applying HomA(−, M2), which leaves\r
powers of τ inside the differentials. The software then computed the cohomology\r
of the resulting complex, regarded as a complex of modules over M2.\r
4.1. Product structure. Multiplication by h0 is represented by vertical black\r
lines (and some blue lines, to be described below). The black arrow in the 0-stem\r
indicates an infinite tower of elements of the form h\r
k\r
0\r
.\r
Multiplication by h1 is represented by diagonal black or red lines. The diagonal\r
red arrows indicate an infinite sequence of copies of M˜\r
2/τ which are connected by h1\r
multiplications. In other words, the red arrows represent a family of elements of the\r
form h\r
k\r
1x such that τhk1x equals zero. In particular, note that h1 is not nilpotent,\r
although τh4\r
1\r
is zero. This is the first example of non-classical phenomena in the\r
motivic Ext groups.\r
Multiplication by h2 is represented by green lines of slope 1/3 (and some magenta\r
lines described below).\r
Inspection of the 3-stem leads us to the next non-classical phenomenon. The\r
element h\r
3\r
1 has weight 3, while the element h\r
2\r
0h2 has weight 2. Classically these\r
elements are equal, but this cannot happen here. Instead we have the relation\r
h\r
2\r
0h2 = τh31\r
.\r
Both sides of this equation have weight 2.\r
The blue vertical lines indicate a multiplication by h0 whose value is τ times a\r
generator. Similarly, a magenta line of slope 1/3 indicates a multiplication by h2\r
whose value is τ times a generator. There are many occurrences of this phenomenon.\r
One example is the relation\r
h\r
2\r
0P h2 = τh21P h1,\r
which is implied by Massey products and the relation h\r
2\r
0h2 = τh31\r
. We will discuss\r
this later. Other interesting examples include\r
h0f0 = τh1e0, h2\r
0\r
j = τh1P e0, h2\r
0k = τh1d\r
2\r
0\r
, h5\r
0\r
r = τc0P d0.\r
Note the element labelled [τg] in the 20-stem with weight 11. We emphasize\r
that this element is indecomposable, i.e., it is not divisible by τ (and the brackets\r
are there to help us remember this). The choice of name makes other formulas\r
work out more consistently, as we shall see later (see also Remark 5.6). Similarly,\r
note the indecomposable elements [h2g] and [h3g]. We have τ[h2g] = h2[τg] and\r
similarly for [h3g], although in the latter case both τ[h3g] and h3[τg] are zero.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 11\r
We also observe that c0d0 and c0e0 are non-zero, even though their classical\r
versions are zero. However, they are killed by τ, which is consistent with Proposition\r
3.5 (see also Remark 5.8).\r
Finally, note that h\r
5\r
0\r
r equals τc0P d0. The element c0P d0 supports multiplica\u0002tions by h1, even though τc0P d0 cannot since it is divisible by h0.\r
Remark 4.2. A look at the Ext chart in Appendix A shows a connection between\r
the new h1-towers (in red) and the spots where there is a shifted h0 (in blue)—\r
that is, where multiplying h0 by a generator gives τ times another generator. This\r
makes a certain amount of sense: classically, h\r
4\r
1\r
is zero because h\r
3\r
1\r
is a multiple\r
of h0, and similarly for h\r
3\r
1P h1, h\r
4\r
1d0, h\r
2\r
1\r
e0, etc. In the motivic world h\r
3\r
1\r
is not a\r
multiple of h0, and so there is no reason for h\r
4\r
1\r
to vanish. This connection breaks\r
down, though, in the case of h\r
4\r
1h4. Even though h\r
3\r
1h4 is not a multiple of h0 in the\r
motivic world, h\r
4\r
1h4 still vanishes. The reason for this is tied to the class [τg] in\r
Ext4,(24,11), and the fact that it lives in weight 11 instead of weight 12—i.e., that\r
our generator is [τg] and not g. This can be explained rigorously in terms of the\r
May spectral sequence; see Remark 5.6.\r
Remark 4.3. In the range 0 ≤ t−s ≤ 34, the weight 0 piece of the motivic E2-term\r
coincides exactly with the classical Adams E2-term. That is, all the τ-torsion has\r
disappeared by the time one reaches weight 0. This is a reflection of the principle,\r
mentioned in the introduction, that the stable homotopy groups πn,0 are most like\r
the classical stable homotopy groups.\r
4.4. Massey products. In this section, all Massey products have zero indetermi\u0002nacy unless explicitly stated otherwise.\r
The symbol P is used for the usual periodicity operator hh3, h4\r
0\r
, −i, defined on\r
any class that is killed by h\r
4\r
0\r
. Note that P increases weights by 4.\r
We can now understand the relation h\r
2\r
0P h2 = τh21P h1. Starting with\r
hh3, h4\r
0\r
, h2ih\r
2\r
0\r
, we shuffle to obtain hh3, h4\r
0\r
, h2\r
0h2i, which equals hh3, h40\r
, τh3\r
1\r
i. By\r
shuffling again, this simplifies to hh3, h4\r
0\r
, h1iτh2\r
1\r
, which is τh2\r
1P h1.\r
The comparison between the motivic Ext groups and the classical Ext groups\r
is compatible with Massey products. This fact can be used to compute motivic\r
Massey products based on known classical computations. For example, consider the\r
Massey product hh\r
2\r
2\r
, h0, h1i. Classically, this Massey product equals c0. Therefore,\r
the motivic Massey product must be non-zero. The Massey product also has weight\r
5. An inspection of the chart shows that there is just one possible value for this\r
Massey product, which we have labelled c0.\r
The method of the previous paragraph allows us to compute the following motivic\r
Massey products, based on known classical formulas:\r
c0 = hh1, h0, h2\r
2\r
i\r
d0 = hh0, h2\r
2\r
, h0, h2\r
2\r
i\r
e0 = hh1, h2, c0, h2i\r
f0 = hh\r
2\r
0\r
, h2\r
3\r
, h2i\r
[τg] = hh2, h1, h0, h0h\r
2\r
3\r

2\r

, h2\r
3\r
, d0i\r
r = hh\r
2\r
0\r
, h2\r
3\r
, h2\r
3\r
, h2\r
0\r
i.

12 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Note that the formula for f0 has indeterminacy {0, τh3\r
1h4}, just as in the classical\r
case. These formulas are printed in [T2], which gives citations to original sources.\r
Something slightly different occurs with the Massey product hh\r
2\r
0\r
, h2\r
3\r
, h1, h0i. The\r
weight here is 9. Classically, this Massey product equals e0, but the weight of\r
motivic e0 is 10. Therefore, we deduce the motivic formula\r
τe0 = hh\r
2\r
0\r
, h2\r
3\r
, h1, h0i.\r
Another difference occurs with the Massey products hh0, c0, d0i and hh0, c0, e0i,\r
which are classically equal to i and j. Motivically, these Massey products are not\r
defined because c0d0 and c0e0 are non-zero. However, τc0d0 and τc0e0 are zero, so\r
the Massey products hh0, c0, τ d0i and hh0, c0, τe0i are defined. By comparison to\r
the classical situation again, we deduce the motivic formulas\r
i = hh0, c0, τ d0i, j = hh0, c0, τe0i.\r
We also have the similar formula k = hh0, c0, [τg]i, but this is slightly different\r
because [τg] is not decomposable.\r
Note that P g is not defined, since g does not exist. However, P([τg]) equals τ d2\r
0\r
.\r
We might abuse notation and write [P g] as another name for d\r
2\r
0\r
.\r
Consider the element [h2g] in the 23-stem. Recall that this element is indecom\u0002posable, but τ[h2g] = h2[τg]. Computer calculations tell us that\r
[h2g] = hh1, h3\r
1h4, h2i.\r
Note that the indeterminacy is zero, since [h2g] is not divisible by h2. On the other\r
hand, the classical Massey product hh1, h3\r
1h4, h2i has indeterminacy {0, h2g}.\r
Similarly, we have the formula\r
[h2g] = hh2, h4\r
1\r
, h4i,\r
with zero indeterminacy again. The corresponding classical Massey product is\r
hh2, 0, h4i, with indeterminacy {0, h2g}.\r
Computer calculations have verified that the indecomposable [h3g] equals\r
hh3, h4\r
1\r
, h4i and hh1, h3\r
1h4, h3i. These formulas have no classical analogues, since\r
h3g equals zero classically.\r
5. The motivic May spectral sequence\r
In this section we explain how one can compute the groups Exts,(t+s,u)\r
A\r
(M2, M2)\r
without the aid of a computer. These groups can be produced by a variation on\r
the classical May spectral sequence [Ma].\r
We continue to assume that the ground field F is algebraically closed, so that\r
M2 = F2[τ]. Let I be the two-sided ideal of the motivic Steenrod algebra generated\r
by the Sqi’s; equivalently, I is the kernel of algebra projection map A → M2.\r
Let GrI (A) denote the associated graded algebra A/I ⊕I/I2 ⊕I\r
2/I3 ⊕· · · . Note\r
that this is a tri-graded algebra, with two gradings coming from A and one from\r
the I-adic valuation. We refer to the I-adic valuation of an element as its May\r
filtration. When indexing elements, we will always write the May filtration first.\r
The motivic May spectral sequence has the form\r
E2 = Exts,(a,b,c)\r
GrI (A)\r
(M2, M2) ⇒ Exts,(b,c)\r
A (M2, M2).\r
As usual, it can be obtained by filtering the cobar complex by powers of I.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 13\r
Let Acl denote the classical Steenrod algebra over F2, and let Icl be the ideal\r
generated by the Sqi’s. We will show that GrI (A) is easily described in terms of\r
GrIcl (Acl). The E2-terms of the motivic and classical May spectral sequence are\r
very similar, but the differentials are different.\r
We recall some notation and ideas from [Ma]. Given a sequence R = (r1, r2, . . .),\r
let ri =\r
P\r
k\r
aik · 2\r
k be the 2-adic expansion of ri\r
P\r
. Define v(R) to be the integer\r
i,k iaik.\r
The relations in the motivic Steenrod algebra with respect to the Milnor basis are\r
of the form P\r
RPS =\r
P\r
X τ\r
u(X)\r
b(X)P\r
T(X)\r
. Here X ranges over certain matrices as\r
described in Theorem 4b of [Mi]; u(X) is a non-negative integer determined by the\r
weights of P\r
R, PS, and PT(X)\r
; and b(X) is a multinomial coefficient depending on\r
X.\r
Recall the Chow weight from Definition 2.10. For any Milnor basis element P\r
R,\r
observe that the Chow weight C(P\r
R) is equal to the negative of the number of odd\r
integers occurring in R; this follows immediately from the formula for bidegrees\r
given in Section 2.5. Note that u(X) is equal to C(P\r
R) + C(PS ) − C(PT(X)\r
).\r
Lemma 5.1. Let P\r
RPS =\r
P\r
X τ\r
u(X)\r
b(X)P\r
T(X)\r
be a relation in the motivic Steen\u0002rod algebra with respect to the Milnor basis. If b(X) = 1 and v(T (X)) = v(R)+v(S),\r
then u(X) equals zero.\r
Proof. Let R = (r1, . . .) and S = (s1, . . .). Let ri =\r
P\r
k\r
aik · 2\r
k and sj =\r
P\r
k\r
bjk · 2\r
k\r
be the 2-adic expansions of ri and sj . Then C(P\r
R) is equal to −\r
P\r
i\r
ai0, and C(P\r
S)\r
is equal to −\r
P\r
j\r
bj0.\r
Let X = (xij ), and let xij =\r
P\r
k\r
eijk · 2\r
k be the 2-adic expansion of xij . Assume\r
that b(X) = 1 and that v(T (X)) equals v(R) + v(S). By Lemma 2.3 of [Ma], it\r
follows that ai0 = ei00 and bj0 =\r
P\r
i\r
eij0 (for j ≥ 1). Thus, C(P\r
R) + C(PS) equals\r
−\r
P\r
i,j≥0\r
eij0, which equals the negative of the number of odd integers in the matrix\r
X.\r
Recall that T (X) = (t1, . . .) is determined by tn =\r
P\r
i+j=n\r
xij . Since b(X) = 1,\r
the definition of b(X) (see Theorem 4b of [Mi]) implies that at most one value of xij\r
is odd in each sum P\r
i+j=n\r
xij . Therefore, the number of odd integers in X equals\r
the number of odd integers in T (X). In other words, C(P\r
T(X)\r
) = C(P\r
R) +C(PS ).\r
It follows that u(X) = 0. \u0003\r
Proposition 5.2.\r
(a) The tri-graded algebras GrI (A) and GrIcl (Acl) ⊗F2 F2[τ] are isomorphic.\r
(b) The quadruply-graded rings ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2) and ExtGr(Acl)(F2, F2)⊗F2 F2[τ]\r
are isomorphic.\r
Proof. Part (a) follows from Lemma 5.1, as in [Ma]. It turns out that v(R) equals\r
the May filtration of P\r
R. The main point is that when we consider the Milnor basis\r
relations modulo higher May filtration, no coefficients of τ appear.\r
Part (b) follows formally from part (a), using that F2 → F2[τ] is flat. \u0003\r
We are interested in the quadruply-graded ring ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2). Our conven\u0002tion is to grade an element x in the form (m, s, f, w), where m is the May filtration,\r
s is the stem (i.e., the topological degree minus the homological degree), f is the\r
Adams filtration (i.e., the homological degree), and w is the weight.\r
The classical ring ExtGr(Acl)(F2, F2) is studied in great detail in [Ma] and [T1],\r
including complete information through the 164-stem. It can be computed as the

14 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
cohomology of the differential graded algebra F2[hij |i > 0, j ≥ 0], with differential\r
given by d(hij ) = P\r
0<k<i hkjhi−k,k+j . The element hij is dual to the Milnor basis\r
element P\r
R, where R consists of all zeros except for 2j at the ith place.\r
By Proposition 5.2, the motivic ring ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2) is the cohomology of the\r
differential graded algebra F2[τ, hi,j |i > 0, j ≥ 0] where:\r
(1) τ has degree (0, 0, 0, −1).\r
(2) hi0 has degree (i, 2\r
i − 2, 1, 2i−1 − 1).\r
(3) hij has degree (i, 2\r
j\r
(2i − 1) − 1, 1, 2\r
j−1\r
(2i − 1)) if j > 0.\r
As in the classical case, these degrees follow from the description of hij as the dual\r
of a specific Milnor basis element. The differential is given by the same formula as\r
the classical one (which happens to be homogeneous with respect to the weight),\r
together with d(τ) = 0.\r
The tables below list the generators and relations for ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2) in stems\r
less than 36. By Proposition 5.2 this information can be directly lifted from the\r
classical computation, which is described in [T1, Theorem 1.2].\r

If we were to draw a chart of the motivic May E2-term, analogous to our chart of\r
the Adams E2-term in Appendix A, it would be entirely in black and look the same

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 15\r
as the classical May E2; each generator would have an associated weight according\r
to the formulas in Table 1. We have chosen not to give this chart because it is the\r
same as the classical chart and is complicated.\r
The d2 differentials in the spectral sequence are easy to analyze. They must be\r
compatible with the d2 differentials in the classical May spectral sequence, and they\r
must preserve the weight. The first time this is interesting is for b20. Classically\r
one has d2(b20) = h\r

1 + h\r
2\r
0h2. Motivically, b20 and h\r
2\r
0h2 both have weight 2 whereas\r
h\r
3\r
1 has weight 3. So the motivic formula must be d2(b20) = τh31 + h\r
2\r
0h2. Note that\r
h\r
i\r
0\r
b20 kills h\r
2+i\r
0 h2, just as in the classical case, but that h\r
i\r
1\r
b20 kills τh3+i\r
1\r
rather\r
than h\r
3+i\r
1\r
.\r
The following proposition lists the d2 differentials on all of our generators with\r
stem less than 36, modified from [T1, Theorem 2.4].\r

Using the above table and the Leibniz rule (together with the relations listed in\r
Table 2), it is a routine but tedious process to calculate the E3-term. As in the\r
classical case, dr is identically zero for odd r for dimension reasons. Therefore, the\r
E4-term is equal to the E3-term. This is depicted in Appendix C below. Note that\r
all the differentials in the May spectral sequence go up one box and to the left one\r
box.\r
5.3. E4-term of the motivic May spectral sequence. We now analyze the\r
E4-term of the motivic May spectral sequence. As for the d2-differentials, the d4-\r
differentials must be compatible with the differentials in the classical May spectral\r
sequence. As shown in [T1], we have:\r
(1) d4(b\r
2\r
20) = h\r
4\r
0h3.\r
(2) d4(h2b30) = h\r
2\r
0h\r
2\r
3\r
.\r
At this point, something new occurs. Classically, d4(b\r
2\r
21) is zero for dimension\r
reasons: d2(h1h4b20) = h\r
4\r
1h4 and so there is nothing in E4 which b\r
2\r
21 could hit.\r
But motivically we have d2(h1h4b20) = τh4\r
1h4, and so h\r
4\r
1h4 survives to E4. Thus\r
it is possible that d4(b\r
2\r
21) = h\r
4\r
1h4. Unfortunately, comparison to the classical May\r
spectral sequence cannot distinguish between the two possible values of d4(b\r
2\r
21),\r
since the classical comparison does not see the τ-torsion.\r
It turns out that d4(b\r
2\r
21) does equal h\r
4\r
1h4. Before we can prove this, we must\r
introduce a new tool.\r
Because GrI (A) is a co-commutative Hopf algebra, ExtGr(A)(M2, M2) has al\u0002gebraic Steenrod operations on it [Ma2]. These operations satisfy the following\r
properties:

16 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
(1) Sqn(xy) = P\r
i+j=n\r
Sqi(x) Sqj(y) (Cartan formula).\r
(2) Sqn(x) = x\r
2\r
if the homological degree of x is n.\r
(3) Sqn(x) = 0 if the homological degree of x is greater than n.\r
In the E2-term of the classical May spectral sequence, one has Sq0(hi) = hi+1,\r
Sq0(bij ) = bi,j+1, and Sq0(hi(j)) = hi+1(j). Recall that Sq0preserves the homo\u0002logical degree, but doubles the internal degree.\r
Motivically, Sq0still preserves the homological degree but doubles the topological\r
degree and the weight. By comparison to the classical situation, we immediately\r
obtain the following calculations.\r
Proposition 5.4. In ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2), the following formulas hold:\r
(a) Sq0(h0) = τ h1.\r
(b) Sq0(hi) = hi+1 for i ≥ 1.\r
(c) Sq0(bi0) = τ\r
2\r
bi1.\r
(d) Sq0(bij ) = bi,j+1 for j ≥ 1.\r
(e) Sq0(h0(S)) = τh1(S) for all S.\r
(f ) Sq0(hi(S)) = hi+1(S) for all S and all i ≥ 1.\r
We will use these facts to continue our analysis of differentials.\r
Proposition 5.5. d4(b\r
2\r
21) = h\r
4\r
1h4.\r
Proof. We argue that h\r
4\r
1h4 must be zero in ExtA(M2, M2); the only way it can die\r
is for b\r
2\r
21 to hit it, and this must happen at d4 because the May filtrations of b\r
2\r
21\r
and h\r
4\r
1h4 are 8 and 5, respectively.\r
To see that h\r
4\r
1h4 is zero in Ext over A, note first that h\r
3\r
2 + h\r
2\r
1h3 is zero because\r
b21 kills it. Now compute that Sq2(h\r
3\r
2 + h\r
2\r
1h3) = h\r
4\r
1h4 using the facts listed above,\r
and therefore this class must vanish. \u0003\r
Remark 5.6. We can now explain our notation [τg] for the element in\r
Ext4,(24,11)\r
A (M2, M2) (see Appendix A). The name g in some sense rightfully belongs\r
to b\r
2\r
21. Classically this class survives the May spectral sequence, but motivically\r
it does not. Motivically, only τb2\r
21 survives, and this gives the generator [τg] of\r
Ext4,(24,11).\r
Even though b\r
2\r
21 does not survive the May spectral sequence, certain multiples of\r
it do survive. For instance, both h2b\r
2\r
21 and h3b\r
2\r
21 survive. These yield the elements\r
of ExtA(M2, M2) we called [h2g] and [h3g].\r
Analyzing the May filtration now shows that there are no further differentials\r
until E8, where we have d8(b\r
4\r
20) = h\r
8\r
0h4, just as happens classically. Then E8 = E∞\r
through the 20-stem, and we have computed Ext over the motivic Steenrod algebra\r
through the 20-stem, in exact agreement with the computer calculations.\r
We leave it to the interested reader to continue this analysis into higher stems.\r
Remark 5.7. In ExtA(M2, M2) one has τh4\r
1 = 0; therefore τh41hn is zero for all n.\r
Classically, h\r
4\r
1hn is actually zero for all n, and we have seen that motivically this\r
is also true when n ≤ 4. It is not true that h\r
4\r
1hn = 0 for n ≥ 5, however.\r
We do know that h\r
2\r
n−2\r
1 hn = 0 for n ≥ 4. To see this, take h\r
4\r
1h4 = 0 and apply\r
Sq4to it to derive h\r
8\r
1h5 = 0; then apply Sq8\r
, Sq16, and so on, to inductively derive\r
the relations for all n. In terms of our Ext-chart, what this means is that for n ≥ 5\r
the element hn admits a ladder of multiplication-by-h1’s which turns red at the

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 17\r
fourth rung (τh4\r
1hn = 0), and which stops completely at the 2n−2nd rung. It is not\r
clear whether the ladder stops before this, but we speculate that it does not.\r
Remark 5.8. One can consider h1-stable groups associated to the motivic May\r
spectral sequence. Namely, consider the colimit of the sequence\r
Exts,(a,b,c)\r
GrI (A) → Exts+1,(a+1,b+2,c+1)GrI (A) → Exts+2,(a+2,b+4,c+2)GrI (A) → · · ·\r
where the maps are multiplication by h1. One obtains a tri-graded spectral sequence\r
which converges to information about which elements of ExtA support infinitely\r
many multiplications by h1.\r
Calculations with the h1-stable groups are much simpler than calculations with\r
the full motivic May spectral sequence. For example, one can show easily that:\r
(1) If x supports infinitely many multiplications by h1, then so does P x.\r
(2) c0d0 and c0e0 both support infinitely many multiplications by h1. In par\u0002ticular, they are non-zero.\r
One consequence of the first observation is that h\r
i\r
1P\r
kh1 is non-zero for all i and k.\r
Using that (P\r
kh1)n = h\r
n−1\r
1 P\r
knh1, it follows that Pkh1 is not a nilpotent element\r
in motivic stable homotopy.\r
5.9. Future directions. We close this portion of the paper with some unresolved\r
problems.\r
Problem 5.10. Compute the ring Ext(M2, M2)[h\r
−1\r
1\r
].\r
Some elements, like c0, survive in this localization. Other elements, like h4, are\r
killed. Some elements, like h4c0, are killed by different powers of h1 motivically\r
and classically. See Remark 5.8 for one possible approach to this problem.\r
Problem 5.11. For each i, determine the smallest k such that h\r
k\r
1hi = 0.\r
For h2, h3, and h4, the motivic and classical answers are the same. Computer\r
calculations show that h\r
8\r
1h5 = 0 but h\r
7\r
1h5 is non-zero. This is different than the\r
classical situation, where h\r
4\r
1h5 is zero but h\r
3\r
1h5 is non-zero. For more about this,\r
see Remark 5.7.\r
Problem 5.12. Find copies of M2/τkfor k > 1 in Ext(M2, M2).\r
Further computer calculations show that a copy of M2/τ 2 appears in the 40-stem.\r
Computer calculations have also spotted a copy of M2/τ 3.\r
6. Differentials, and an application to classical topology\r
By comparison to the classical Adams spectral sequence, we immediately obtain\r
the differentials\r
d2(h4) = h0h\r
2\r
3\r
d3(h0h4) = h0d0\r
d3(h\r
2\r
0h4) = h\r
2\r
0d0\r
d2(e0) = h\r
2\r
1d0\r
d2(f0) = h\r
2\r
0\r
e0\r
d2(h1e0) = h\r
3\r
1d0.\r
Through the 18-stem these are the only non-zero differentials.

18 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
The multiplicative structure implies that we have an infinite family of new dif\u0002ferentials of the form\r
d2(h\r
k\r
1\r
e0) = h\r
k+2\r
1\r
d0.\r
Weight considerations allow for the possibility that d6(c1) equals h\r
2\r
1P c0. The\r
proof that this doesn’t happen involves two steps. First, h\r
4\r
1P c0 survives the spectral\r
sequence because it cannot be hit by anything: the class has weight 13 and there\r
is nothing of weight 13 in column 21. Then h\r
2\r
1P c0 cannot be hit by c1 because the\r
latter is annihilated by h\r
2\r
1 whereas the former is not.\r
There is also the possibility of an exotic differential d5(h2e0) = h\r
3\r
1P c0. Note\r
that h2e0 6= h0[τg] (they live in different weights) and so we may not argue that\r
this d5 vanishes using h0-linearity as one would do classically. However, as in the\r
previous paragraph, h2e0 is annihilated by h1, while h\r
3\r
1P c0 is not.\r
A similar analysis confirms that [h2g] does not hit h\r
5\r
1P\r
2h1 via a d9.\r
The next possible d2 differential is\r
d2(c0e0) = h\r
2\r
1\r
c0d0,\r
which follows again from the multiplicative structure.\r
The class h1h4c0 is a product of two permanent cycles h1h4 and c0, so it is a\r
permanent cycle. In particular, d3(h1h4c0) equals zero, not h1c0d0. It follows that\r
h4c0 is also a permanent cycle.\r
We now conclude that c0d0 and h1c0d0 are permanent cycles. The class h\r
2\r
1h4c0\r
also survives to E∞, as do the classes h1[h3g] and h\r
2\r
1\r
[h3g]. These are ‘exotic’\r
permanent cycles, in the sense that one does not see them in the classical Adams\r
spectral sequence. In the next sections we will remark on what this tells us about\r
motivic stable homotopy groups, but this will depend on convergence questions\r
about the spectral sequence and also on an analysis of some hidden multiplicative\r
τ-extensions. See Remark 7.16.\r
This essentially determines all differentials in the spectral sequence until the 27-\r
stem, where one is faced with the possibility of a d2 or even a d7 on the class [h3g].\r
The techniques we have described so far do not let us compute this differential.\r
The analysis of differentials for t − s ≤ 34 we will be completed in Section 8, using\r
information coming from the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.\r
Remark 6.1. Suppose now that the ground field F is not algebraically closed. In\r
this case the ring M2 (the motivic cohomology of a point) is more complicated, but\r
still known. The work in [V1] shows that M\r
p,q\r
2\r
is nonzero only in the range 0 ≤ p ≤\r
q, that M\r
p,p\r
2\r
∼= KM\r
p\r
(F)/2 (the mod 2 Milnor K-theory of F), that M\r
0,1\r
2 = Z/2.hτi,\r
and that the multiplication by τ\r
i maps M\r
p,p\r
2 → M\r
p,p+i\r
2\r
are isomorphisms for all p\r
and all i ≥ 0. The ring M2 is generated by M\r
1,1\r
2\r
and τ.\r
It is not hard to show from this that if F contains a square root of −1 then the\r
action of the Steenrod operations on M2 is trivial. If we let A denote the motivic\r
Steenrod algebra over F and A¯ the motivic Steenrod algebra over the algebraic\r
closure, then A ∼= M2 ⊗F2[τ] A¯. It follows by a change-of-rings argument that\r
ExtA(M2, M2) ∼= ExtA¯(F2[τ], F2[τ]) ⊗F2[τ] M2.\r
This makes for a nice picture of the Adams E2-term—it looks the same as in\r
Appendix A, but now every copy of M2 consists of groups which not only extend\r
down into the page (via multiplication by elements of M\r
0,1\r
2\r
) but also down and to\r
the left (via multiplication by elements of M\r
1,1\r
2\r
). This opens up the possibility for

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 19\r
new differentials which take a generator to some product of a generator with an\r
element of M\r
p,q\r
2\r
. We do not know if any of these exotic differentials actually exist.\r
6.2. A new tool for classical differentials. The comparison between the motivic\r
Adams spectral sequence and the classical Adams spectral sequence provides a new\r
tool for studying classical differentials. The point is that the weight gives a simple\r
method for determining that certain classical differentials must vanish.\r
We illustrate this with a basic example of h1h4 in the 16-stem. Motivically, this\r
element has weight 9. Considering elements of weight 9 in the 15-stem, we see that\r
the only possible motivic differential is d3(h1h4) = h1d0. It follows that the only\r
possible classical differential on h1h4 is d3(h1h4) = h1d0.\r
The same argument yields the following, as well as many other results similar to\r
it:\r
Proposition 6.3. In the classical Adams spectral sequence there are no differentials\r
of the form dr(h1hj ) = h\r
n\r
0hj , for any j and r.\r
The above result is already known, of course (in fact it is known that h1hj is\r
a permanent cycle, which is stronger). Still, the simplicity of our motivic proof is\r
appealing.\r
The most famous question about the vanishing of differentials in the classical\r
Adams spectral sequence is the Kervaire problem, which asks whether all differ\u0002entials vanish on the classes h\r
2\r
i\r
. One might hope that our weight arguments say\r
something nontrivial about this problem, but unfortunately this doesn’t seem to\r
be the case. For example, consider the element h\r
2\r
4\r
in the 30-stem. This element\r
has weight 16. But the elements k, h0k, and h\r
2\r
0k in the 29-stem all have weight 16,\r
so we learn nothing by considering the weights. Although it is not shown on our\r
chart, it turns out that something similar happens with h\r
2\r
5\r
in the 62-stem, where\r
h\r
2\r
5 has weight 32 and so do almost all of the generators in the 61-stem.\r
7. Convergence issues\r
The evident vanishing line in the motivic Adams spectral sequence shows that\r
it is certainly converging to something; but we would like to give this ‘something’\r
an appropriate homological name. In this section we will prove that the spectral\r
sequence converges to the homotopy groups of the H-nilpotent completion of the\r
motivic sphere spectrum S. This is almost by definition, but not quite—one must\r
be careful of details.\r
7.1. Background. Below we will set up the homological Adams spectral sequence\r
in the usual way, using the geometric cobar resolution. But in order for this to work\r
we need to know H∗,∗(H) and, more generally, H∗,∗(H ∧ H ∧ · · · ∧ H). The former\r
is essentially calculated by Voevodsky in [V2, V3], but does not appear explicitly.\r
For the latter, there is no general K¨unneth theorem for motivic homology and\r
cohomology. So in both cases we must work a little to derive the necessary results.\r
First recall that since H is a ring spectrum, there is a canonical map\r
θX : H∗∗(X) → HomM2\r
(H∗∗(X), M2) for any motivic spectrum X. Given a ho\u0002mology element S\r
p,q → H ∧ X and a cohomology element X → Ss,t ∧ H, one forms\r
the composite\r
S\r
p,q → H ∧ X → H ∧ Ss,t ∧ H → Ss,t ∧ H ∧ H → Ss,t ∧ H

20 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
to get an element of πp−s,q−t(H). This pairing is M2-linear in the cohomology class,\r
and so induces the desired map.\r
Proposition 7.2. The map θH : H∗∗(H) → HomM2(H∗∗(H), M2) is an isomor\u0002phism.\r
Since A = H∗∗(H) this identifies H∗∗(H) with the dual steenrod algebra A∗ as\r
computed by Voevodsky in [V2].\r
To prove the above proposition we work in the category of H-modules. By\r
[RO, Thm. 1], the homotopy category of HZ-modules is equivalent to Voevodsky’s\r
triangulated category of motives. A similar result holds for H-modules, where\r
one works with motives having coefficients in F2. A Tate motive, under this\r
equivalence, is an H-module equivalent to a wedge of modules of the form Σp,qH.\r
A proper Tate motive of weight ≥ n, in the sense of [V3, Def. 3.49], is a\r
Tate motive equivalent to a wedge of modules of the form Σp,qH where p ≥ 2q and\r
q ≥ n. The result [V3, Thm. 4.20(2)] states that the spectra H ∧Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n)\r
are proper Tate motives of weight ≥ n. From this we deduce the following:\r
Lemma 7.3. As a left H-module, H ∧ H is equivalent to a motivically finite type\r
wedge of H (with one summand for every admissible monomial in the motivic Steen\u0002rod algebra). In particular, π∗∗(H ∧ H) is free as an M2-module.\r
Proof. As a motivic spectrum, H is a directed homotopy colimit of desuspensions\r
of the spectra Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n). Precisely,\r
H ≃ hocolim nΣ\r
−2n,−nΣ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n),\r
where the maps in this hocolim come from the structure maps in the spectrum H.\r
It follows that H ∧ H is equivalent to\r
hocolim n\r
\u0002\r
Σ\r
−2n,−nH ∧ Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n)\r
\u0003\r
(7.4) ,\r
where the homotopy colimit is taken in the category of left H-modules. Since\r
each H ∧ Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n) is a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ n, its Σ−2n,−n\r
desuspension is a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ 0. By [V3, Prop. 3.65], the\r
homotopy colimit of (7.4) is therefore also a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ 0.\r
To complete the proof we consider the chain of isomorphisms\r
A\r
∗∗ = [H, Σ∗∗H] ∼= [H ∧ H, Σ∗∗H]H = [∨αΣnα H, Σ∗∗H]H =\r
Y\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗∗\r
.\r
Here [−, −]H denotes maps in the homotopy category of left H-modules. The fact\r
that A is free on the admissible monomials tells us what the nα’s must be (and\r
that the above product is also a sum). \u0003\r
Proof of Proposition 7.2. If M is an H-module, there is a canonical map\r
θH,M : π∗,∗(M)\r
∼=−→ [Σ∗∗H, M]H → HomM2\r
([Σ∗∗M, H]H, M2).\r
The definition of the second map in the composite is completely analagous to the\r
definition of θX above. Moreover, when M has the form H ∧ X, the map θH,M is\r
naturally isomorphic to θX. So our goal is to show that θH,H∧H is an isomorphism.\r
It is clear that θH,M is an isomorphism when M = H, or more generally when\r
M is a motivically finite type wedge of suspensions of H. So by Lemma 7.3 this\r
applies for M = H ∧ H. \u0003

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 21\r
Our next goal is the following K¨unneth isomorphism:\r
Proposition 7.5. For any motivic spectrum A which admits a right H-module\r
structure, the natural K¨unneth map H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H) → H∗∗(A ∧ H) is an\r
isomorphism. In particular, the maps H∗∗(H)\r
⊗(s) → H∗∗(H∧(s)\r
) are isomorphisms\r
for every s (where the tensors are over M2).\r
This result is automatic if one believes that H is cellular in the sense of [DI2],\r
using the standard K¨unneth isomorphism for cellular objects [loc. cit]. The cel\u0002lularity of H has been claimed by Hopkins and Morel, but their proof has never\r
appeared. We will avoid this issue by instead proving the proposition in a way that\r
only uses the cellularity of H ∧ H as an H-module.\r
Consider the homotopy category of H-modules. Define the H-cellular spectra\r
to be the smallest full subcategory which contains H, is closed under arbitrary\r
wedges, and has the property that when A → B → C is a cofiber sequence and two\r
of the three terms are in the subcategory, so is the third. By Lemma 7.3, H ∧ H is\r
H-cellular as a left H-module.\r
Proof of Proposition 7.5. If A is any right H-module, then A∧ H ≃ A∧H (H ∧ H).\r
Since H∧H is a wedge of suspension of H’s, A∧H is therefore a wedge of suspensions\r
of A’s. It’s easy to now show that H∗∗(A ∧ H) ∼= H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H). \u0003\r
Let hSiH be the smallest full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy cate\u0002gory that satisfies the following properties:\r
(i) hSiH contains S;\r
(ii) If A → B → C is a cofiber sequence and two of the terms belong to hSiH,\r
then so does the third;\r
(iii) hSiH is closed under arbitrary wedges;\r
(iv) If A ∈ hSiH then A ∧ H is also in hSiH.\r
The smallest full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category that satisfies\r
(i)–(iii) is denoted hSi, and equals the category of cellular spectra of [DI2].\r
Lemma 7.6. For every A ∈ hSiH, the canonical maps H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H∧(s)) →\r
H∗∗(A ∧ H∧(s)) are isomorphisms for every s.\r
Proof. Let D be the full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category\r
consisting of all objects A for which the maps in the statement of the lemma are\r
isomorphisms, for all s. It is evident that D satisfies properties (i)–(iii). The second\r
statement of Proposition 7.5 implies that D satisfies (iv) as well, so D contains\r
hSiH. \u0003\r
7.7. The homological Adams spectral sequence. In this section we set up\r
homological Adams spectral sequences in the motivic world, and discuss their con\u0002vergence properties. Let E be a motivic homotopy ring spectrum (a ring object\r
in the homotopy category of motivic spectra). Let E be the homotopy fiber of\r
S → E. As in [Bo], for any spectrum X there is a standard tower of homotopy\r
fiber sequences having\r
Xs = E\r
∧(s)\r
∧ X, Ws = E ∧ Xs = E ∧ E\r
∧(s)\r
∧ X.\r
The fiber sequence Xs+1 → Xs → Ws is induced by smashing E¯ → S → E with\r
Xs. This tower satisfies conditions (a-c) in [R, Def. 2.2.1] for being an E∗-Adams\r
resolution. Below we will show that it also satisfies condition (d).

22 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Let Cs−1 be the homotopy cofiber of Xs → X0. Then there are induced maps\r
Cs → Cs−1, and the cofiber of this map is Σ1,0Ws. One gets a tower under X of\r
the form\r
ΣW3 ΣW2 ΣW1\r
X /· · · /C2\r
/\r
OO\r
C1\r
OO\r
/C0.\r
OO\r
The homotopy limit of the Ci’s is called the E-nilpotent completion of X, and\r
denoted X∧\r
E (see [Bo, Section 5]). Note that for formal reasons the homotopy\r
spectral sequences of the {Cs} tower and the {Xs} tower may be identified.\r
Now suppose that E is associative and unital on-the-nose—that is, E is a mo\u0002tivic symmetric ring spectrum. Then for any spectrum X one may consider the\r
cosimplicial spectrum\r
E ∧ X\r
/\r
/E ∧ E ∧ X\r
///E ∧ E ∧ E ∧ X\r
//\r
(7.8) //· · ·\r
Here the coface maps are all induced by the unit S → E, and the codegeneracies\r
(not drawn) all come from multiplication E ∧ E → E. The homotopy limit of this\r
cosimplicial spectrum is another model for X∧\r
E. To see this, note that the usual Tot\r
tower is an E-nilpotent resolution of X in the sense of Bousfield [Bo, Def. 5.6], and\r
so the holim of this Tot tower is homotopy equivalent to X∧\r
E by [Bo, Prop. 5.8].\r
[Note: The proof of [Bo, Prop. 5.8] goes through almost verbatim in the motivic\r
category except for one step, in [Bo, 5.11], where a map is proven to be a weak\r
equivalence by showing that it induces isomorphisms on stable homotopy groups.\r
Motivically one must look at homotopy classes of maps from all smooth schemes,\r
not just spheres; but otherwise the argument is the same.]\r
Now, it is a general fact in any model category that a homotopy limit of a\r
cosimplicial object is weakly equivalent to the homotopy limit of the corresponding\r
diagram in which one forgets the codegeneracies. This is because the subcategory\r
of ∆ consisting of the monomorphisms is homotopy initial inside of ∆. But if X\r
is itself a ring spectrum, then the cosimplicial object E• ∧ X (regarded without\r
codegeneracies) is a diagram of ring spectra. We may then take its homotopy\r
limit in the model category of motivic ring spectra, and we get something whose\r
underlying spectrum is equivalent to what we got by just taking the holim in motivic\r
spectra. This is a long way of saying that if X and E are both ring spectra then\r
via this holim we may build a model for X∧\r
E which is itself a ring spectrum.\r
Remark 7.9. If E is a ring spectrum and X is a module over E, then the cosimpli\u0002cial object of (7.8) admits a contracting homotopy. This shows that the canonical\r
map X → X∧\r
E is an equivalence in this case. We will make use of this fact in\r
Section 8 below.\r
Now we will specialize and take E = H. Let X be any motivic spectrum,\r
and write {Xs, Ws} for the canonical Adams tower just constructed. Note that\r
if X ∈ hSiH then by a simple induction we have that all the objects Xs and Ws\r
belong to hSiH as well.\r
Proposition 7.10. For any motivic spectrum X ∈ hSiH, the E2-term of the\r
homotopy spectral sequence for the tower {Xs, Ws} is naturally isomorphic to\r
ExtH∗∗H(M2, H∗∗(X)) (where this means Ext in the category of H∗∗H-comodules).

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 23\r
Proof. The object Ws is equal to H ∧ H\r
∧(s)\r
∧ X. It follows from Proposition 7.5\r
and an easy induction on s that\r
π∗(Ws) ∼= [H∗∗(H)]⊗(s) ⊗M2 H∗∗(X)\r
and\r
H∗∗(Ws) ∼= H∗∗H ⊗M2[H∗∗(H)]⊗(s) ⊗M2 H∗∗(X).\r
The usual arguments show that\r
0 → H∗∗(X) → H∗∗(W0) → H∗∗(W1) → H∗∗(W2) → · · ·\r
may be identified with the cobar resolution for H∗∗(X), and that the complex\r
0 → π∗∗(W0) → π∗∗(W1) → · · ·\r
may be identified with the complex obtained by applying HomH∗∗H(H∗∗, −) to the\r
cobar resolution. \u0003\r
Remark 7.11. The convergence of the homological Adams spectral sequence works\r
in the standard way, as described in [Bo, Section 6]. That is, if lim1\r
r Es,t,ur\r
(X) = 0\r
for each s, t, u then the two natural maps\r
π∗,∗(X∧\r
H) → lims\r
π∗,∗(Cs), and\r
Fsπ∗,∗(X∧\r
H)/Fs+1π∗,∗(X∧\r
H) → E\r
s,∗,∗\r
∞ (X)\r
are isomorphisms. Here Fs denotes the filtration on π∗,∗(X∧\r
H) coming from the\r
tower {Ct}.\r
7.12. Comparison of towers. To complete our discussion we will verify that the\r
cohomological Adams spectral sequence for the sphere spectrum, as constructed in\r
Section 3, also converges to the homotopy groups of S\r
∧\r
H.\r
Write {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
} for the ‘naive’ Adams tower constructed as in Section 3. That is,\r
X′\r
0 = X, each W′s\r
is a wedge of Eilenberg-MacLane spectra, and X′\r
s → W′s\r
is sur\u0002jective on H-cohomology. Our goal is to identify the homotopy spectral sequences\r
of {X′\r
s\r
} and {Xs}, under suitable assumptions on X. The latter is the same as for\r
{Cs}, and hence (conditionally) converges to the homotopy groups of X∧\r
H.\r
Lemma 7.13. Suppose that in the tower {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
}, all the spectra W′\r
s are mo\u0002tivically finite type wedges of H. Suppose also that H∗∗(X) is free over M2 and\r
the natural map H∗∗(X) → HomM2(H∗∗(X), M2) is an isomorphism. Then the\r
complex\r
0 → H∗∗(X) → H∗∗(W′\r
0\r
) → H∗∗(W′\r
1\r
) → H∗∗(W′\r
2\r
) → · · ·\r
is a resolution of H∗∗(X) by relative injective comodules (see [R, A1.2.10] for ter\u0002minology). Moreover, the E2-term of the homotopy spectral sequence for {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
}\r
is naturally isomorphic to ExtH∗∗H(M2, M2).\r
Proof. Start with the complex\r
0 ← H∗∗(X) ← H∗∗(W′\r
0\r
) ← H∗∗(W′\r
1\r
) ← · · ·\r
Because of the way the tower {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
} was constructed, this is a resolution. The\r
assumption that each W′\r
s\r
is a motivically finite type wedge of Eilenberg-MacLane\r
spectra shows that it is a resolution by free H∗∗H modules. In particular, it is a\r
resolution by free M2-modules. Since H∗∗(X) is itself free as an M2-module, the\r
resolution is split (as a complex of M2-modules).

24 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Now apply the functor HomM2(−, M2). The resulting complex is still exact, and\r
there is a map of complexes\r
0\r
/H∗∗(X) /\r
\u000F\u000F\r
H∗∗(W′\r
0\r
) /\r

/Hom(H∗∗(X), M2) /Hom(H∗∗(W′\r
0\r
), M2) /Hom(H∗∗(W′\r
1\r
), M2) /· · ·\r
Each vertical map is an isomorphism, by our assumptions on X and the W′\r
i\r
’s.\r
Hence the top complex is a resolution which is split over M2. Each H∗∗(W′\r
i\r
) is a\r
direct product of copies of H∗∗H, and so is certainly a relative injective.\r
The final claim of the lemma results from the natural maps\r
π∗∗(W′\r
s\r
) → HomH∗∗H(H∗∗, H∗∗(W′\r
s\r
)),\r
which are isomorphisms given our assumptions about the spectra W′\r
s\r
. \u0003\r
Our final task is to compare the {Xs, Ws} tower to the {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
} tower. Note\r
that each W′\r
s\r
is naturally an H-module (being a wedge of suspensions of H’s).\r
Using this, one can inductively construct a map of towers {Xs, Ws} → {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
}\r
by the standard method. Start with the identity map X0 → X′\r
0\r
, and consider the\r
diagram\r
W0 X0 ∧ H /X′\r
0 ∧ H /W′0 ∧ H\r
\u0007\u0007\r
X0\r
OO\r
/X′\r
0\r
OO\r
/W′\r
0\r
.\r
OO\r
One obtains a map W0 → W′\r
0 by following around the diagram. There is then an\r
induced map X1 → X′\r
1\r
, and one continues inductively.\r
Proposition 7.14. Assume that X is in hSiH, that H∗∗(X) is free over M2, that\r
all the spectra W′\r
s are motivically finite type wedges of H, and that the natural\r
map H∗∗(X) → HomM2(H∗∗(X), M2) is an isomorphism. Then the map of towers\r
{Xs, Ws} → {X′\r
s\r
, W′\r
s\r
} induces a map of spectral sequences which is an isomorphism\r
from the E2-terms onward.\r
Proof. This is almost immediate from the previous results. The map of towers\r
induces a map of complexes\r
0\r
/H∗∗(X) /\r
\u000F\u000F\r
H∗∗(W0) /\r
\u000F\u000F\r
H∗∗(W1) /\r

· · ·\r
0\r
/H∗∗(X) /H∗∗(W′\r
0\r
) /H∗∗(W′\r
1\r
) /· · ·\r
which is the identity on H∗∗(X). By our previous results, these complexes are\r
resolutions of H∗∗(X) by relative injectives over H∗∗H. Hence upon applying the\r
functor HomH∗∗H(H∗∗, −), the map of resolutions induces an isomorphism on coho\u0002mology groups. These cohomology groups are naturally isomorphic to the E2-terms\r
of the spectral sequences for the two respective towers, so we are done. \u0003\r
Corollary 7.15. The cohomological motivic Adams spectral sequence for the sphere\r
spectrum S strongly converges to the bigraded homotopy groups of S\r
∧\r
H.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 25\r
Proof. Let X = S. By the above results, our naively-constructed Adams spectral\r
sequence for S is the same (from E2 on) as the homotopy spectral sequence for the\r
tower {Cs}. The homotopy limit of this tower is S\r
∧\r
H, and the convergence properties\r
are as described in Remark 7.11. The evident vanishing line of the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence—which can be proven in exactly the same way as for the classical\r
case [A]—guarantees strong convergence. \u0003\r
Applying topological realization to the tower {Cs} for the motivic sphere spec\u0002trum yields the corresponding tower for the classical sphere spectrum. It follows\r
that there is a map from the topological realization of S\r
∧\r
H to the spectrum (Scl)\r
∧\r
Hcl\r
.\r
This can even be constructed as a map of ring spectra. We get an induced ring\r
map\r
ψ: π∗,∗(S\r
∧\r
H) → π∗(S\r
∧\r
Hcl\r
) = π∗(S)\r
∧\r
2\r
from π∗,∗(S\r
∧\r
H) to the classical 2-completed stable homotopy groups of spheres.\r
Remark 7.16. We can now summarize some of our conclusions from Section 6 as\r
follows. Through the 34-stem, the elements h\r
n\r
1\r
, h\r
n\r
1P\r
kh1 (n ≥ 4), hn\r
1P\r
k\r
c0 (n ≥ 2),\r
and h\r
2\r
1h4c0 all survive the spectral sequence to determine ‘exotic’ motivic homotopy\r
classes in π∗∗(S\r
∧\r
H), in the sense that they vanish under the map ψ. These claims\r
exactly match what was discovered in [HKO] using the Adams-Novikov spectral\r
sequence. The reader may wonder why we are not making the same assertion\r
about the classes c0d0 and [h3g]. It turns out that the latter does not survive the\r
spectral sequence, and for c0d0 there is a hidden τ-extension which shows that this\r
class is not truly exotic. This will all be explained at the end of the next section.\r
8. The motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence\r
The motivic version of the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence was considered in\r
[HKO]. We wish to use it here to deduce some differentials in the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence, which will in turn lead to an application to classical algebraic\r
topology. Our approach for setting up the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence is\r
somewhat different from that of [HKO], and does not depend on any of the results\r
from that paper.\r
8.1. Backround. Recall that MGL denotes the motivic cobordism spectrum. This\r
is constructed as a motivic symmetric ring spectrum in [PPR, Section 2.1].\r
By the same methods as in classical topology one can write down the Quillen\r
idempotent and use it to split off BP L from MGL. This is remarked briefly in [HK,\r
Section 2] and carried out in detail in [Ve]. One constructs the Quillen idempotent\r
e: MGL(2) → MGL(2) and then the motivic spectrum BP L is defined to be the\r
homotopy colimit of the sequence\r
MGL(2)\r
e −→ MGL(2)\r
e −→ · · ·\r
One knows from the motivic Thom isomorphism that H∗∗(MGL) ∼= M2[b1, b2, . . .]\r
where bi has bidegree (2i, i), exactly as in classical topology. It follows readily that\r
H∗∗(BP L) ∼= M2[v1, v2, . . .] where vi has bidegree (2(2i − 1), 2\r
i − 1). By the same\r
arguments as in classical topology (or by using topological realization), it is eas\u0002ily shown that the map H∗∗(BP L) → H∗∗(H) is an injection whose image is the\r
sub-coalgebra P∗ = M2[τ\r
−1\r
ζ\r
2\r
1\r
, τ −1ζ\r
2\r
2\r
, . . .] of A∗∗ (see Section 2.5 for notation).

26 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
In some sense our discussion below would be most natural if there exists a model\r
for BP L which is a symmetric ring spectrum, and where there is a map of symmetric\r
ring spectra BP L → H. This is not known, however, and it is stronger than what\r
we actually need. It turns out that all we really need are pairings BP L ∧ BP L →\r
BP L and BP L ∧ H → H which are unital on the nose, and that is easily arranged\r
for reasons we now explain.\r
First, one observes that the Quillen idempotent e: MGL(2) → MGL(2) is a map\r
of homotopy ring spectra (not a map of symmetric ring spectra). It is then easy\r
to see that there is a map µ: BP L ∧ BP L → BP L making BP L a homotopy ring\r
spectrum (not a symmetric ring spectrum) and such that MGL(2) → BP L is a\r
map of homotopy ring spectra. Choose a model for BP L which is fibrant as a\r
symmetric spectrum, and for which the unit (up to homotopy) of µ is a cofibration\r
S → BP L. The map (S ∧BP L)∨(BP L∧S) → BP L∧BP L is then a cofibration,\r
and so has the homotopy lifting property. The triangle\r
(S ∧ BP L) ∨ (BP L ∧ S) /\r
\u000F\u000F\r
BP L\r
BP L ∧ BP L\r
µ\r
l5\r
ll\r
ll\r
ll\r
ll\r
ll\r
ll l\r
commutes up to homotopy, and therefore we may choose another multiplication\r
µ\r
′\r
: BP L ∧ BP L → BP L, homotopic to µ, so that the triangle commutes on the\r
nose.\r
Analogously, start with the Thom class BP L → H (induced from the Thom\r
class on MGL) and consider the composite map BP L ∧ H → H ∧ H → H. This\r
pairing is unital up to homotopy, and therefore by the same arguments as above\r
we can choose a homotopic pairing which is unital on the nose.\r
As a final prelude for the work in the next section, suppose E is a motivic\r
spectrum with a pairing E ∧ E → E that is unital on the nose (but where no\r
associativity assumptions are made). Then for any motivic spectrum X one may\r
form the cosimplicial object without codegeneracies\r
E ∧ X\r
/\r
/E ∧ E ∧ X\r
///E ∧ E ∧ E ∧ X\r
//\r
(8.2) //· · ·\r
The homotopy limit of this diagram may be modelled by a Tot-like object, defined\r
to be the mapping space from the standard cosimplicial simplex (without codegen\u0002eracies) ∆•\r
. By looking at the usual skeletal filtration of ∆• one defines Toti objects\r
as usual, and obtains a tower of fibrations whose limit is Tot. The homotopy fiber\r
of Toti → Toti−1 is Ωi(E∧(i) ∧ X).\r
The same arguments as usual (meaning in the true cosimplicial case, where there\r
are codegeneracies) show that this Tot-tower is an E-nilpotent resolution of X in\r
the sense of Bousfield [Bo, Def. 5.6], and therefore our Tot object is a model for\r
the E-nilpotent completion of X.\r
Finally, assume that there is a pairing E ∧ X → X which is unital on the\r
nose (but where again there is no associativity condition). This map then gives\r
a “contracting homotopy” in the cosimplicial object without codegeneracies (8.2).\r
The usual arguments show that X splits off every piece of the Tot-tower, and\r
its complementary summand in each Toti becomes null homotopic in Toti−1. One\r
shows that consequently the map X → Tot(E\r
•∧X) is a weak equivalence. In other\r
words, the same thing that works for cosimplicial objects in the case of pairings

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 27\r
which are associative on the nose (see Remark 7.9) also works for cosimplicial\r
objects without codegeneracies.\r
8.3. Construction of the spectral sequence. For any spectrum X, construct\r
a bi-cosimplicial spectrum—without codegeneracies—of the form\r
[n], [k] 7→ BP L∧(n+1) ∧ X ∧ H∧(k+1) (8.4) .\r
We will continue to say “bi-cosimplicial object” below, even though this is an\r
abuse of terminology since there are no codegeneracies. The homotopy limit of\r
this bi-cosimplicial spectrum is a kind of “bi-completion”, which we will denote by\r
X∧\r
{BP L,H}\r
. We will only concern ourselves with X = S.\r
We can compute the homotopy limit of our bi-cosimplicial object by first taking\r
homotopy limits in one direction—with respect to n, say—and then taking the\r
homotopy limit of the resulting cosimplicial object in the other direction (k in\r
this case). Taking homotopy limits with respect to n, one obtains the following\r
cosimplicial spectrum:\r
H∧\r
BP L\r
/\r
/(H ∧ H)\r
∧\r
BP L\r
///(H∧(3))\r
∧\r
BP L\r
//\r
(8.5) //· · ·\r
But H is a BP L-module up to homotopy, and therefore so is H∧(k)for each k.\r
It follows from the observations in the previous section that the maps H∧(k) →\r
(H∧(k))\r
∧\r
BP L are all equivalences. Therefore the homotopy limit of (8.5) is equivalent\r
to S\r
∧\r
H. So we have shown that S\r
∧\r
{BP L,H} ≃ S\r
∧\r
H.\r
Now, we can also compute the homotopy limit of our bi-cosimplicial object by\r
first taking homotopy limits in the k direction, and then in the n direction. Taking\r
homotopy limits with respect to k, one obtains the following cosimplicial spectrum:\r
BP L∧\r
H\r
/\r
/(BP L ∧ BP L)\r
∧\r
H\r
///(BP L∧(3))\r
∧\r
H\r
//\r
(8.6) //· · ·\r
For each k, we may run the homological Adams spectral sequence for computing\r
the homotopy groups of (BP L∧(k))\r
∧\r
H. Since BP L is cellular, Proposition 7.10 says\r
that the E2-term of this spectral sequence has the expected description in terms of\r
Ext. Then by the same arguments as in classical topology, the spectral sequence\r
for computing π∗∗((BP L∧(k))\r
∧\r
H) is concentrated in even degrees, and therefore\r
collapses. For k = 1 this allows us to conclude that\r
π∗∗(BP L∧\r
H) ∼= Z(2)[τ, v1, v2, . . .],\r
and if we call the above ring V then for all k ≥ 1 we get\r
π∗∗((BP L∧(k))\r
∧\r
H) ∼= V [t1, t2, . . .] ⊗V · · · ⊗V V [t1, t2, . . .] (k − 1 factors).\r
where each ti has bidegree (2(2i − 1), 2\r
i − 1). In other words, everything is exactly\r
as in classical topology except for the extra generator τ and the new grading by\r
weight.\r
Now we run the homotopy spectral sequence for the homotopy limit of (8.6),\r
which from now on we will refer to as the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral se\u0002quence. We find that the E2-term is precisely ExtBP∗BP (BP∗, BP∗) tensored over\r
Z(2) with Z(2)[τ], with the generators assigned appropriate weights. Unlike the\r
motivic Adams E2-term, the assignment of the weights in this case follows a very\r
simple pattern. Namely, generators in classical Exts,t yield motivic generators in\r
Exts,(t,t/2).

28 DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
A chart showing the Adams-Novikov E2-term is given in Appendix B. Recall that\r
this is really a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional spectral sequence.\r
We have not written any of the weights in the chart, because these are all deduced\r
by the simple formula given in the last paragraph. In terms of the usual naming\r
conventions, αi has weight i, β2 has weight 5, η3/2 has weight 13, etc.\r
8.7. Comparison of the Adams and Adams-Novikov spectral sequences.\r
The differentials in the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence can be deduced\r
by using the comparison map (over the complex numbers) to the classical one. For\r
instance, classically we have d3(α3) = α\r
4\r
1\r
. Motivically this doesn’t make sense,\r
because α3 lies in weight 3 whereas α\r
4\r
1\r
lies in weight 4. But it allows us to deduce\r
the motivic differential d3(α3) = τα4\r
1\r
. In fact, this reasoning shows\r
d3(α4k−1) = τh3\r
1α4k−3 and d3(α4k+2) = τh3\r
1α4k (k ≥ 1).\r
These differentials are depicted in our chart, although except for the first of them\r
they are not given their true length (to make the chart easier to read).\r
It is easy to continue this analysis and deduce all the motivic differentials in the\r
given range (there are only three others). This is done in [HKO]. The resulting\r
E∞ term is shown in Appendix B.\r
Our goal here is really to compare the information given by the motivic Adams\u0002Novikov spectral sequence to that given by the motivic Adams spectral sequence.\r
Recall that these are converging to the same groups, since S\r
∧\r
{BP L,H} ≃ S\r
∧\r
H.\r
Comparing the two spectral sequences, we see that the groups they are converg\u0002ing to are in complete agreement through the 21-stem. An interesting difference\r
occurs in the 22-stem, however. To make what we are about to say easier to follow,\r
let us use the term “bound” to describe classes which are part of an h1-tower which\r
survives to E∞: e.g., the towers determined by h1, P\r
kh1 and Pk\r
c0 in the Adams\r
spectral sequence.\r
In the Adams spectral sequence we have three unbound classes surviving in\r
column 22: h2c1 (weight 13), c0d0 (weight 13), and P d0 (weight 12). In the Adams\u0002Novikov spectral sequence we only get two unbound survivors in the 22-stem, both\r
in weight 13. The only way this is consistent is if there is a multiplicative extension\r
of the form\r
τ(c0d0) = P d0\r
in the homotopy groups of S\r
∧\r
H.\r
The next possible difference in the two spectral sequences comes in the 26-stem,\r
where so far we have not resolved whether the Adams differential d2([h3g]) is equal\r
to h\r
3\r
1h4c0. But the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence gives that the 26-stem of\r
S\r
∧\r
{H,BP L}\r
consists of M2 ⊕ M2 ⊕ M2/(τ) plus bound terms of higher weight, where\r
the first two generators are in weights 14 and 16, and the latter is in weight 15.\r
The only way this is consistent with the Adams spectral sequence is if we indeed\r
have the Adams differential d2([h3g]) = h\r
3\r
1h4c0.\r
Continuing this kind of comparison between the two spectral sequences, here is\r
a list of what we find:\r
(1) There is a hidden τ-extension between the element h1[h3g] and the element d\r
2\r
0\r
.\r
(2) The element h\r
2\r
1\r
[h3g] survives the spectral sequence to determine an element in\r
π29,18(S\r
∧\r
H) which is killed by τ\r
2 but not killed by τ.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 29\r
(3) Let x be the generator in Ext8,(39,18)\r
A (M2, M2). Then in the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence we have\r
d2(x) = h\r
2\r
1d\r
2\r
0\r
, d3(τx) = c0P d0, and d4(τ\r
2x + h7\r
0h5) = P\r
2\r
d0.\r
8.8. Another application to classical topology. To close this section we use\r
our motivic techniques to once again prove a result which is purely about classical\r
algebraic topology. Recall that in the classical stable homotopy groups of spheres,\r
there are unique classes in the 2-components of π8(S) and π14(S) which are detected\r
in the Adams spectral sequence by c0 and d0, respectively. These elements of the\r
stable homotopy groups go under the names ǫ and κ. The product c0d0 vanishes\r
in the E2-term of the classical Adams spectral sequence, but this does not tell us\r
that ǫκ vanishes—it just says that ǫκ lives in higher Adams filtration. We can use\r
the algebra of the motivic spectral sequences to show that ǫκ is in fact nonzero:\r
Proposition 8.9. In the classical stable homotopy groups of spheres, the product\r
ǫκ is nonzero and is detected by P d0 in the Adams spectral sequence.\r
Proof. There are unique elements ǫM and κM in π8,5(S\r
∧\r
H ) and π14,8(S\r
∧\r
H) which are\r
detected by c0 and d0 in the motivic Adams spectral sequence. It must be that\r
ψ(ǫM) = ǫ and ψ(κM ) = κ, where ψ: πp,q(S\r
∧\r
H) → πp(S)\r
∧\r
2\r
is our map from the end\r
of Section 7.12 (because ψ(ǫM ) is detected by c0 in the classical Adams spectral\r
sequence, etc.)\r
The product ǫMκM is detected by c0d0, which is nonzero in the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence. We discovered in the last section that there is a hidden τ\u0002extension in π22,∗(S\r
∧\r
H), telling us that τ ·(ǫM κM) gives the generator in π22,12(S\r
∧\r
H).\r
But this generator is detected by P d0, and so the same remains true upon applying\r
ψ. That is, ψ(τ · ǫM κM) is nonzero and detected by P d0. Recall that ψ is a map\r
of ring spectra, and ψ(τ) = 1. So ψ(τ · ǫM κM) = ǫκ, and we are done. \u0003\r
Again, Proposition 8.9 is a known result in algebraic topology. It is implicit,\r
for instance, in the homotopy groups of tmf as given in [Ba, Prop. 7.2(5)] (this\r
was explained to us by Mark Behrens). Still, our motivic proof is very simple, only\r
depending on the algebraic computation of the motivic Adams and Adams-Novikov\r
E2-terms and a comparison of differentials.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE\r
DANIEL DUGGER AND DANIEL C. ISAKSEN\r
Abstract. We present some data on the cohomology of the motivic Steenrod\r
algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Our results are\r
based on computer calculations and a motivic version of the May spectral\r
sequence. We discuss features of the associated Adams spectral sequence,\r
and use these tools to give new proofs of some results in classical algebraic\r
topology. We also consider a motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence. The\r
investigations reveal the existence of some stable motivic homotopy classes\r
that have no classical analogue."""

In modern algebraic geometry one studies varieties defined over arbitrary fields,\r
whereas classically this was done over only the real or complex numbers. The\r
subject of motivic homotopy theory is an attempt to generalize algebraic topology\r
in the same way; rather than study standard topological spaces, one studies a\r
category of “spaces” defined over a fixed ground field. The subject was put on firm\r
foundations by the paper [MV], and it encompasses several areas of study like ´etale\r
cohomology and algebraic K-theory.\r
One of the things that came out of [MV] was the realization that almost any\r
object studied in classical algebraic topology could be given a motivic analog. In\r
particular, one could define the motivic stable homotopy groups of spheres. The\r
present paper begins an investigation of the Adams spectral sequence, based on mod\r
2 motivic cohomology, that abuts to these groups. Our results not only contribute\r
to the study of motivic phenomena, but we find that they can be used to prove\r
theorems about the classical stable homotopy groups as well.\r
In the motivic stable homotopy category (over a given field) there is a bigraded\r
family of spheres S\r
p,q. It follows that one has a bigraded family of stable homo\u0002topy groups πp,q(X) for any motivic spectrum X, and consequently all generalized\r
homology and cohomology theories are bigraded. For the sphere spectrum S, we\r
will abbreviate πp,q(S) to just πp,q.\r
The object S\r
n,0\r
is like an ordinary sphere, and smashing with it models the\r
n-fold suspension in the triangulated structure. The object S\r
1,1\r
is the suspension\r
spectrum of the scheme A\r
1 − 0, and represents a ‘geometric’ circle. The other\r
spheres are obtained by smashing together copies of S\r
1,1 and S1,0\r
, and taking\r
formal desuspensions. One should take from this that the groups πp,0 are most like\r
the classical stable homotopy groups, whereas the groups πp,q for q > 0 somehow\r
contain more geometric information. We will see this idea again in Remark 4.3.\r

The current knowledge about the groups πp,q is due to work of Morel. It follows\r
from results in [M3] that πp,q = 0 for p < q. In [M2] it is shown that the groups\r
πn,n can be completely described in terms of generators and relations using the\r
Milnor-Witt K-theory of the ground field. This theorem of Morel is in some sense\r
a motivic analog of the classical computation of the stable 0-stem.\r
Let F be a field of characteristic zero, and let M2 denote the bigraded motivic\r
cohomology ring of Spec F, with Z/2-coefficients. Let A be the mod 2 motivic\r
Steenrod algebra over F. All of these notions will be reviewed in Section 2 below.\r
The motivic Adams spectral sequence is a tri-graded spectral sequence with\r
E\r
s,t,u\r
2 = Exts,(t+s,u)\r
A (M2, M2),\r
and dr : Es,t,u\r
r → Es+r,t−1,ur\r
. Here s is the homological degree of the Ext group (the\r
Adams filtration), and (t+s, u) is the internal bigrading coming from the bigrading\r
on A and M2: so t+s is the topological dimension and u is the motivic weight. The\r
spectral sequence was first studied in the paper [M1]. It converges to something\r
related to the stable motivic homotopy group πt,u; see Corollary 7.15 for a precise\r
statement.\r
The motivic Steenrod algebra A is very similar to the classical mod 2 Steenrod\r
algebra, but the action of A on M2 is nontrivial in general. This extra feature\r
seriously complicates the computation of the Ext groups in the Adams E2-term. If\r
the ground field F contains a square root of −1, however, the action of A on M2\r
is trivial and the Ext groups are much more accessible. This is the situation that\r
we study in the present paper. In fact, for added convenience we almost entirely\r
restrict to the case of algebraically closed fields.\r
One goal of this paper is to present some computer calculations of the E2-term\r
of the motivic Adams spectral sequence. We have carried out the computations far\r
enough to discover several exotic elements that have no classical analogues.\r
By the usual ‘Lefschetz principle’, the Adams spectral sequence over any alge\u0002braically closed field of characteristic zero takes the same form as over the complex\r
numbers. One might as well restrict to this case. But over the complex numbers,\r
there is a map from the (tri-graded) motivic Adams spectral sequence to the (bi\u0002graded) classical one. Comparing the two spectral sequences allows information to\r
pass in both directions. On the one hand, we can deduce motivic differentials from\r
knowledge of the classical differentials. We can also turn this around, though, and\r
use the algebra of the motivic E2-term to prove results about classical differentials,\r
and about extension problems as well. This is described further in Sections 6.2\r
and 8.8 below. We stress that these methods are purely algebraic; as soon as one\r
knows the motivic spectral sequence exists, and can do the related algebraic calcu\u0002lations, some results about the classical Adams spectral sequence come out almost\r
for free.\r
It is useful to keep in mind the analogy of mixed Hodge theory and its influence\r
on topological gadgets like the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. Once it is known that\r
the Leray-Serre differentials preserve the Hodge weight, these differentials become\r
easier to analyze—there are fewer places where they can be nontrivial. A similar\r
thing happens with the Adams spectral sequence and the motivic weight. The three\u0002dimensional nature of the motivic Adams spectral sequence allows the nontrivial\r
groups to be more spread out, and also allows the algebra of Massey products to\r
work out in slightly different ways than the classical story. As a result, certain

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 3\r
purely topological phenomena become easier to analyze. So far this technique\r
has only yielded results of casual interest, but a more thorough study in higher\r
dimensions might be fruitful.\r
Throughout the article, we are considering only the situation where the ground\r
field is algebraically closed and has characteristic 0. The latter assumption is ab\u0002solutely necessary at the moment, as the motivic Steenrod algebra is unknown\r
over fields of positive characteristic. The assumption that the ground field is al\u0002gebraically closed is less crucial. It is very easy to extend from the algebraically\r
closed case to the case where the ground field contains a square root of −1; see\r
Remark 6.1. When considering fields which do not contain such a square root,\r
however, the difficulty of the calculations increases dramatically. A future paper\r
[DHI] will deal with this more general case.\r
Remark 1.1. In this paper we only deal with the motivic Adams spectral sequence\r
based on mod 2 motivic cohomology. Most aspects of our discussion also work at\r
odd primes, but the motivic Steenrod algebra in that case is exactly isomorphic\r
to the classical Steenrod algebra—the only difference being the existence of the\r
extra grading by weights. The E2-term of the odd primary motivic Adams spectral\r
sequence therefore takes the same form as it does classically.\r
1.2. Organization of the paper. In the first two sections we introduce the rel\u0002evant background and set up the cohomological Adams spectral sequence. (It is\r
probably better to work with the homological Adams spectral sequence, but work\u0002ing cohomologically allows us to postpone some motivic issues to later in the pa\u0002per.) Then we discuss basic properties of the motivic Ext groups and give the\r
computation of the Adams E2-term for t ≤ 34. Next we show how to derive this\r
computation by hand with the motivic May spectral sequence. Then we make some\r
simple computations of differentials, and use this to prove a theorem in classical\r
topology (Proposition 6.3).\r
In Section 7 we turn to convergence issues, and prove that our Adams spec\u0002tral sequence converges to the homotopy groups of the H-nilpotent completion\r
S\r
∧\r
H of the sphere spectrum, where H is the motivic mod 2 Eilenberg-Mac Lane\r
spectrum. This entails dealing with the homological Adams spectral sequence and\r
related material. Section 8 discusses the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence,\r
first studied in [HKO], and uses this to deduce further differentials in the motivic\r
Adams spectral sequence. From this information we then prove a second theorem\r
in classical topology, namely Proposition 8.9.\r
The appendices contain charts of the motivic Adams spectral sequence, the mo\u0002tivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence, and the E4-term of the motivic May spec\u0002tral sequence. These charts are best viewed in color."""

M2 for the bigraded cohomology ring H∗,∗(Spec F; Z/2). A theorem of Voevodsky\r
[V1] describes M2 explicitly in terms of the Milnor K-theory of F. Unfortunately\r
this result doesn’t have a simple reference, and instead is a confluence of Corollary\r
6.9(2), Theorem 6.1, and Corollary 6.10 of [V1]. Unless otherwise stated, we will\r
always assume in this paper that F is algebraically closed. For such fields the\r
description of M2 has a particularly simple form:\r
Theorem 2.2 (Voevodsky). The bigraded ring M2 is the polynomial ring F2[τ] on\r
one generator τ of bidegree (0, 1).\r
In a bidegree (p, q), we shall refer to p as the topological degree and q as the\r
weight.\r
2.3. The motivic Steenrod algebra. We write A for the ring of stable cohomol\u0002ogy operations on mod 2 motivic cohomology. Voevodsky has computed this ring\r
explicitly for fields of characteristic zero: see [V2, Section 11] and [V3, Theorem\r
1.4]. In general, the ring is generated over M2 by the Steenrod operations Sqi. Note\r
that Sq2klies in bidegree (2k, k), whereas Sq2k−1lies in bidegree (2k − 1, k − 1).\r
These operations satisfy a complicated version of the Adem relations. Again, the\r
description simplifies quite a bit when the ground field is algebraically closed:\r
Theorem 2.4 (Voevodsky). The motivic Steenrod algebra A is the M2-algebra\r
generated by elements Sq2kand Sq2k−1for all k ≥ 1, of bidegrees (2k, k) and\r
(2k − 1, k − 1) respectively, and satisfying the following relations for a < 2b:\r

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 5\r
Note the coefficients τ\r
?\r
in the Adem relation above. Here the “?” denotes an\r
exponent which is either 0 or 1. We could explicitly write the exponent, but only at\r
the expense of making the formula appear more unwieldy. The exponent is easily\r
determined in practice, because it is precisely what is needed in order to make the\r
formula homogeneous in the bidegree.\r
For example, consider the formula Sq2Sq2 = τ\r
? Sq3\r
Sq1. Since Sq2has bidegree\r
(2, 1), the left side has total bidegree (4, 2). On the other hand, Sq1has bidegree\r
(1, 0) and Sq3has bidegree (3, 1), so we require one τ on the right side in order\r
to make the formula homogeneous. In other words, we have the motivic Adem\r
relation Sq2Sq2 = τ Sq3Sq1. It turns out this is representative of what happens in\r
all the motivic Adem relations: the τ appears precisely when a and b are even and\r
c is odd.\r
The Steenrod operations act on the motivic cohomology H∗,∗(X) of any smooth\r
scheme X. In particular, they act on the cohomology of Spec F. In our case, where\r
F is algebraically closed, M2 is concentrated entirely in topological degree 0. It\r
follows that the Steenrod operations (other than the identity) act trivially on M2\r
for dimension reasons.\r

realization functor from motivic spectra over C to ordinary spectra, as described\r
in [MV] [DI1]. This functor is uniquely determined (up to homotopy) by the fact\r
that it preserves homotopy colimits and weak equivalences, and sends the motivic\r
suspension spectrum of a smooth scheme X to the ordinary suspension spectrum of\r
its topological space of complex-valued points X(C). We generalize this notation,\r
so that if E is any motivic spectrum then E(C) denotes its topological realization.\r
Let H be the mod 2 motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, i.e., the motivic\r
spectrum that represents mod 2 motivic cohomology. It follows from [V3, Lemma\r
4.36] that H(C) is the classical mod 2 Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum Hcl. So topo\u0002logical realization induces natural transformations Hp,q(X) → Hp\r
(X(C)) denoted\r
α 7→ α(C). We implicitly consider H∗(X(C)) to be a bigraded object concentrated\r
in weight 0.\r
Definition 2.7. For any motivic spectrum X, let\r
θX : H∗,∗(X) ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] → H∗(X(C)) ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
]\r
be the M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-linear map that takes a class α of weight w in H∗,∗(X) to τ\r
wα(C).\r
In order for θX to be well-defined, we must observe that τ(C) equals 1 in the\r
singular cohomology of a point. This follows by splitting the topological realization\r
map into two pieces\r
Hp,q(Spec C) → H\r

where the group in the middle is ´etale cohomology. For p ≤ q the first map is an\r
isomorphism by [V1], and it is a classical result of Grothendieck and his collabora\u0002tors [SGA4, XI] that the second map is an isomorphism. In particular, this holds\r
when p = 0 and q = 1. Since the group in question is Z/2, it must be that τ maps\r
to 1.\r
Lemma 2.8. The map θX is an isomorphism of bigraded M2[τ\r
−1\r
]-modules if X is\r
the motivic sphere spectrum or if X is the motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum.\r
In the following proof, we write Acl for the classical topological mod 2 Steenrod\r
algebra.\r
Proof. This follows directly from the description of the motivic cohomology of a\r
point and of the motivic Steenrod algebra.\r
For the sphere spectrum, θX is just the map M2 ⊗M2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
] → F2 ⊗F2 M2[τ\r
−1\r
],\r
which is obviously an isomorphism.\r
For the motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum, note that H∗,∗(X) is the motivic\r
Steenrod algebra, and H∗(X(C)) is the classical topological Steenrod algebra. The\r
map θX takes Sq2kto τ\r

that A ⊗M2 M2[τ\r

Also, Acl ⊗F2 M2[τ\r

It follows that θX is an isomorphism. \u0003

Before giving the final lemmas of this section we need a brief discussion of a\r
finite type condition. For the remainder of this subsection we work over a general\r
field F (not necessarily algebraically closed).\r
Definition 2.10. Given an element x of bidegree (p, q) in a bigraded group, the\r
Chow weight C(x) of x is the integer 2q − p.\r
The terminology is motivated by the fact that 2q − p is a natural index in the\r
higher Chow group perspective on motivic cohomology [Bl]. It is known that the\r
mod 2 motivic cohomology groups Hp,q(X) of any smooth scheme are concentrated\r
in non-negative Chow weight and also in the range p ≥ 0 (see [MVW, Thm. 19.3]\r
and [V1, Thm. 7.8]).\r
Definition 2.11. Let {nα = (pα, qα)}α∈S be a set of bidegrees. This set is mo\u0002tivically finite type if for any α in S, there are only finitely many β in S such\r
that pα ≥ pβ and 2qα − pα ≥ 2qβ − pβ.\r
For example, this condition is satisfied if:\r
(i) the pα’s are bounded below, and\r
(ii) for each α, there are only finitely many β’s for which pβ = pα and qβ ≤ qα.\r
Definition 2.12. Let X be a motivic spectrum. A wedge of suspensions ∨α∈SΣ\r
nα X\r
is motivically finite type if the index set of bidegrees is motivically finite type.\r
Likewise, a free graded module over M2 is motivically finite type if it is of the\r
form ⊕α∈SΣ\r
nαM2 for a motivically finite type index set of bidegrees.\r
Lemma 2.13. For any smooth scheme X and any motivically finite type index set\r
of bidegrees {nα}α∈S, the canonical map\r
M\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(X) →\r
Y\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(X)\r
is an isomorphism. Here Σ\r
nα denotes the algebraic shifting of bigraded modules.\r
Proof. The motivically finite type condition guarantees that in each bidegree, only\r
finitely many terms of the product are nonzero. \u0003\r
Lemma 2.14. Let X belong to the smallest triangulated category of motivic spectra\r
that contains the spheres and motivically finite type wedges of suspensions of the\r
mod 2 motivic Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum H. Then θX is an isomorphism.\r
Proof. Let C be the full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category con\u0002sisting of all motivic spectra A such that θA is an isomorphism. It is clear that C is\r
closed under suspensions and cofiber sequences, and by Lemma 2.8 C contains the\r
sphere spectrum and H. It only remains to show that C contains all motivically\r
finite type wedges of H.\r
Let W = ∨αΣ\r
nα H be a motivically finite type wedge of suspensions of H. Then\r
H∗,∗(W) = Q\r
α Σ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(H), and by Lemma 2.13 this equals ⊕αΣ\r
nα H∗,∗\r
(H) as\r
modules over M2. We may then distribute the direct sum over the tensors that\r
appear in the definition of θW , and conclude that θW is an isomorphism based on\r
the fact that θH is. \u0003"""

A chart showing the motivic Ext groups is given in Appendix A. There are\r
several things about the chart we must explain, however. First, the reader should\r
view these pictures as a projection of a three-dimensional grid, where the u axis\r
comes out of the page. Although our diagrams suppress this third direction, it is\r
always important to keep track of the weights. Our two-dimensional charts are\r
drawn using the classical conventions, so that t is on the horizontal axis and s is\r
on the vertical axis. We refer to t as the stem and s as the Adams filtration. Note\r
that column t of the chart contains groups related to πt,∗.\r
Recall from Section 3.4 that Ext0,(∗,∗)is the algebra M˜\r
2, i.e., a polynomial\r
algebra over F2 with one generator τ in bidegree (0, −1). The Yoneda product makes\r
Ext∗,(∗,∗)into a graded module over Ext0,(∗,∗). Therefore, Ext∗,(∗,∗)decomposes\r
into a direct sum of copies of M˜\r
2 and M˜2/τk\r
. It turns out that in the range\r
t − s ≤ 34, the only value of k for which the latter occurs is k = 1.\r
In our chart, each black circle represents a copy of M˜"""

The results in this section were obtained by computer calculations. The software\r
computed a resolution for M2 over A, and from this information extracted Ext\r
groups and product information in the usual way. In the range t − s ≤ 34, the\r
computations have been checked by two independent software packages, and have\r
been further corroborated by work with the May spectral sequence described in\r
Section 5.\r
The software computed a minimal free resolution over the graded ring A. In\r
the classical case one computes Ext by applying HomA(−, F2), which makes all the\r
differentials vanish. In the motivic case we are applying HomA(−, M2), which leaves\r
powers of τ inside the differentials. The software then computed the cohomology\r
of the resulting complex, regarded as a complex of modules over M2."""

red arrows indicate an infinite sequence of copies of M˜\r
2/τ which are connected by h1\r
multiplications. In other words, the red arrows represent a family of elements of the\r
form h\r
k\r
1x such that τhk1x equals zero. In particular, note that h1 is not nilpotent,\r
although τh4\r
1\r
is zero. This is the first example of non-classical phenomena in the\r
motivic Ext groups.\r
Multiplication by h2 is represented by green lines of slope 1/3 (and some magenta\r
lines described below).\r
Inspection of the 3-stem leads us to the next non-classical phenomenon. The\r
element h\r
3\r
1 has weight 3, while the element h\r
2\r
0h2 has weight 2. Classically these\r
elements are equal, but this cannot happen here. Instead we have the relation\r
h\r
2\r
0h2 = τh31\r
.\r
Both sides of this equation have weight 2.\r
The blue vertical lines indicate a multiplication by h0 whose value is τ times a\r
generator. Similarly, a magenta line of slope 1/3 indicates a multiplication by h2\r
whose value is τ times a generator. There are many occurrences of this phenomenon.\r
One example is the relation\r
h\r
2\r
0P h2 = τh21P h1,\r
which is implied by Massey products and the relation h\r
2\r
0h2 = τh31\r
. We will discuss\r
this later. Other interesting examples include\r

r = τc0P d0.\r
Note the element labelled [τg] in the 20-stem with weight 11. We emphasize\r
that this element is indecomposable, i.e., it is not divisible by τ (and the brackets\r
are there to help us remember this). The choice of name makes other formulas\r
work out more consistently, as we shall see later (see also Remark 5.6). Similarly,\r
note the indecomposable elements [h2g] and [h3g]. We have τ[h2g] = h2[τg] and\r
similarly for [h3g], although in the latter case both τ[h3g] and h3[τg] are zero.

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 11\r
We also observe that c0d0 and c0e0 are non-zero, even though their classical\r
versions are zero. However, they are killed by τ, which is consistent with Proposition\r
3.5 (see also Remark 5.8).\r
Finally, note that h\r
5\r
0\r
r equals τc0P d0. The element c0P d0 supports multiplica\u0002tions by h1, even though τc0P d0 cannot since it is divisible by h0.\r
Remark 4.2. A look at the Ext chart in Appendix A shows a connection between\r
the new h1-towers (in red) and the spots where there is a shifted h0 (in blue)—\r
that is, where multiplying h0 by a generator gives τ times another generator. This\r
makes a certain amount of sense: classically, h\r
4\r
1\r
is zero because h\r
3\r
1\r
is a multiple\r
of h0, and similarly for h\r
3\r
1P h1, h\r
4\r
1d0, h\r
2\r
1\r
e0, etc. In the motivic world h\r
3\r
1\r
is not a\r
multiple of h0, and so there is no reason for h\r
4\r
1\r
to vanish. This connection breaks\r
down, though, in the case of h\r
4\r
1h4. Even though h\r
3\r
1h4 is not a multiple of h0 in the\r
motivic world, h\r
4\r
1h4 still vanishes. The reason for this is tied to the class [τg] in\r
Ext4,(24,11), and the fact that it lives in weight 11 instead of weight 12—i.e., that\r
our generator is [τg] and not g. This can be explained rigorously in terms of the\r
May spectral sequence; see Remark 5.6.\r
Remark 4.3. In the range 0 ≤ t−s ≤ 34, the weight 0 piece of the motivic E2-term\r
coincides exactly with the classical Adams E2-term. That is, all the τ-torsion has\r
disappeared by the time one reaches weight 0. This is a reflection of the principle,\r
mentioned in the introduction, that the stable homotopy groups πn,0 are most like\r
the classical stable homotopy groups.\r

M2 = F2[τ]. Let I be the two-sided ideal of the motivic Steenrod algebra generated\r
by the Sqi’s; equivalently, I is the kernel of algebra projection map A → M2.\r

that this is a tri-graded algebra, with two gradings coming from A and one from\r

Let Acl denote the classical Steenrod algebra over F2, and let Icl be the ideal\r
generated by the Sqi’s. We will show that GrI (A) is easily described in terms of\r
GrIcl (Acl). The E2-terms of the motivic and classical May spectral sequence are\r
very similar, but the differentials are different.\r
We recall some notation and ideas from [Ma]. Given a sequence R = (r1, r2, . . .),\r
let ri =\r

k\r
aik · 2\r
k be the 2-adic expansion of ri\r
P\r

of the form P\r

. Here X ranges over certain matrices as\r
described in Theorem 4b of [Mi]; u(X) is a non-negative integer determined by the\r
weights of P\r
R, PS, and PT(X)\r
; and b(X) is a multinomial coefficient depending on\r
X.\r
Recall the Chow weight from Definition 2.10. For any Milnor basis element P\r
R,\r
observe that the Chow weight C(P\r
R) is equal to the negative of the number of odd\r
integers occurring in R; this follows immediately from the formula for bidegrees\r
given in Section 2.5. Note that u(X) is equal to C(P\r
R) + C(PS ) − C(PT(X)\r
).\r
Lemma 5.1. Let P\r

P\r

k be the 2-adic expansion of xij . Assume\r
that b(X) = 1 and that v(T (X)) equals v(R) + v(S). By Lemma 2.3 of [Ma], it\r
follows that ai0 = ei00 and bj0 =\r
P\r
i\r
eij0 (for j ≥ 1). Thus, C(P\r
R) + C(PS) equals\r
−\r
P\r
i,j≥0\r
eij0, which equals the negative of the number of odd integers in the matrix\r
X.\r
Recall that T (X) = (t1, . . .) is determined by tn =\r
P\r
i+j=n\r
xij . Since b(X) = 1,\r
the definition of b(X) (see Theorem 4b of [Mi]) implies that at most one value of xij\r
is odd in each sum P\r
i+j=n\r
xij . Therefore, the number of odd integers in X equals\r
the number of odd integers in T (X). In other words, C(P\r

It follows that u(X) = 0. \u0003\r

the May filtration of P\r

(3) Sqn(x) = 0 if the homological degree of x is greater than n.\r
In the E2-term of the classical May spectral sequence, one has Sq0(hi) = hi+1,\r
Sq0(bij ) = bi,j+1, and Sq0(hi(j)) = hi+1(j). Recall that Sq0preserves the homo\u0002logical degree, but doubles the internal degree.\r
Motivically, Sq0still preserves the homological degree but doubles the topological\r
degree and the weight. By comparison to the classical situation, we immediately\r
obtain the following calculations.\r
Proposition 5.4. In ExtGrI (A)(M2, M2), the following formulas hold:\r
(a) Sq0(h0) = τ h1.\r
(b) Sq0(hi) = hi+1 for i ≥ 1.\r
(c) Sq0(bi0) = τ\r

Proposition 5.5. d4(b\r
2\r
21) = h\r
4\r
1h4.\r
Proof. We argue that h\r
4\r
1h4 must be zero in ExtA(M2, M2); the only way it can die\r
is for b\r
2\r
21 to hit it, and this must happen at d4 because the May filtrations of b\r
2\r
21\r
and h\r
4\r
1h4 are 8 and 5, respectively.\r
To see that h\r
4\r
1h4 is zero in Ext over A, note first that h\r

2\r
1h3 is zero because\r
b21 kills it. Now compute that Sq2(h\r

it does not. Motivically, only τb2\r

Even though b\r

it do survive. For instance, both h2b\r
2\r
21 and h3b\r
2\r
21 survive. These yield the elements\r

0h4, just as happens classically. Then E8 = E∞\r
through the 20-stem, and we have computed Ext over the motivic Steenrod algebra\r
through the 20-stem, in exact agreement with the computer calculations.\r
We leave it to the interested reader to continue this analysis into higher stems.\r
Remark 5.7. In ExtA(M2, M2) one has τh4\r
1 = 0; therefore τh41hn is zero for all n.\r
Classically, h\r
4\r
1hn is actually zero for all n, and we have seen that motivically this\r
is also true when n ≤ 4. It is not true that h\r
4\r
1hn = 0 for n ≥ 5, however.\r
We do know that h\r

1 hn = 0 for n ≥ 4. To see this, take h\r
4\r
1h4 = 0 and apply\r
Sq4to it to derive h\r
8\r
1h5 = 0; then apply Sq8\r
, Sq16, and so on, to inductively derive\r
the relations for all n. In terms of our Ext-chart, what this means is that for n ≥ 5\r
the element hn admits a ladder of multiplication-by-h1’s which turns red at the

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 17\r
fourth rung (τh4\r
1hn = 0), and which stops completely at the 2n−2nd rung. It is not\r
clear whether the ladder stops before this, but we speculate that it does not.\r
Remark 5.8. One can consider h1-stable groups associated to the motivic May\r
spectral sequence. Namely, consider the colimit of the sequence\r
Exts,(a,b,c)\r
GrI (A) → Exts+1,(a+1,b+2,c+1)GrI (A) → Exts+2,(a+2,b+4,c+2)GrI (A) → · · ·\r
where the maps are multiplication by h1. One obtains a tri-graded spectral sequence\r
which converges to information about which elements of ExtA support infinitely\r
many multiplications by h1.\r
Calculations with the h1-stable groups are much simpler than calculations with\r
the full motivic May spectral sequence. For example, one can show easily that:\r
(1) If x supports infinitely many multiplications by h1, then so does P x.\r
(2) c0d0 and c0e0 both support infinitely many multiplications by h1. In par\u0002ticular, they are non-zero.\r

4\r
1P c0 survives the spectral\r

is nothing of weight 13 in column 21. Then h\r
2\r
1P c0 cannot be hit by c1 because the\r
latter is annihilated by h\r
2\r

There is also the possibility of an exotic differential d5(h2e0) = h\r
3\r
1P c0. Note\r
that h2e0 6= h0[τg] (they live in different weights) and so we may not argue that\r
this d5 vanishes using h0-linearity as one would do classically. However, as in the\r
previous paragraph, h2e0 is annihilated by h1, while h\r
3\r
1P c0 is not.\r
A similar analysis confirms that [h2g] does not hit h\r

The next possible d2 differential is\r
d2(c0e0) = h\r

which follows again from the multiplicative structure.\r
The class h1h4c0 is a product of two permanent cycles h1h4 and c0, so it is a\r
permanent cycle. In particular, d3(h1h4c0) equals zero, not h1c0d0. It follows that\r
h4c0 is also a permanent cycle.\r
We now conclude that c0d0 and h1c0d0 are permanent cycles. The class h\r
2\r
1h4c0\r
also survives to E∞, as do the classes h1[h3g] and h\r
2\r
1\r
[h3g]. These are ‘exotic’\r
permanent cycles, in the sense that one does not see them in the classical Adams\r
spectral sequence. In the next sections we will remark on what this tells us about\r
motivic stable homotopy groups, but this will depend on convergence questions\r
about the spectral sequence and also on an analysis of some hidden multiplicative\r
τ-extensions. See Remark 7.16.\r
This essentially determines all differentials in the spectral sequence until the 27-\r
stem, where one is faced with the possibility of a d2 or even a d7 on the class [h3g].\r
The techniques we have described so far do not let us compute this differential.\r
The analysis of differentials for t − s ≤ 34 we will be completed in Section 8, using\r
information coming from the motivic Adams-Novikov spectral sequence.\r
Remark 6.1. Suppose now that the ground field F is not algebraically closed. In\r
this case the ring M2 (the motivic cohomology of a point) is more complicated, but\r
still known. The work in [V1] shows that M\r
p,q\r
2\r
is nonzero only in the range 0 ≤ p ≤\r
q, that M\r
p,p\r
2\r
∼= KM\r

2 = Z/2.hτi,\r
and that the multiplication by τ\r
i maps M\r
p,p\r
2 → M\r
p,p+i\r
2\r
are isomorphisms for all p\r
and all i ≥ 0. The ring M2 is generated by M\r
1,1\r
2\r
and τ.\r
It is not hard to show from this that if F contains a square root of −1 then the\r
action of the Steenrod operations on M2 is trivial. If we let A denote the motivic\r
Steenrod algebra over F and A¯ the motivic Steenrod algebra over the algebraic\r
closure, then A ∼= M2 ⊗F2[τ] A¯. It follows by a change-of-rings argument that\r
ExtA(M2, M2) ∼= ExtA¯(F2[τ], F2[τ]) ⊗F2[τ] M2.\r

Adams spectral sequence and the classical Adams spectral sequence provides a new\r
tool for studying classical differentials. The point is that the weight gives a simple\r
method for determining that certain classical differentials must vanish.\r
We illustrate this with a basic example of h1h4 in the 16-stem. Motivically, this\r
element has weight 9. Considering elements of weight 9 in the 15-stem, we see that\r
the only possible motivic differential is d3(h1h4) = h1d0. It follows that the only\r
possible classical differential on h1h4 is d3(h1h4) = h1d0.\r
The same argument yields the following, as well as many other results similar to\r
it:\r
Proposition 6.3. In the classical Adams spectral sequence there are no differentials\r
of the form dr(h1hj ) = h\r
n\r
0hj , for any j and r.\r
The above result is already known, of course (in fact it is known that h1hj is\r
a permanent cycle, which is stronger). Still, the simplicity of our motivic proof is\r
appealing.\r
The most famous question about the vanishing of differentials in the classical\r
Adams spectral sequence is the Kervaire problem, which asks whether all differ\u0002entials vanish on the classes h\r

something nontrivial about this problem, but unfortunately this doesn’t seem to\r

has weight 16. But the elements k, h0k, and h\r

to get an element of πp−s,q−t(H). This pairing is M2-linear in the cohomology class,\r
and so induces the desired map.\r
Proposition 7.2. The map θH : H∗∗(H) → HomM2(H∗∗(H), M2) is an isomor\u0002phism.\r
Since A = H∗∗(H) this identifies H∗∗(H) with the dual steenrod algebra A∗ as\r
computed by Voevodsky in [V2].\r
To prove the above proposition we work in the category of H-modules. By\r
[RO, Thm. 1], the homotopy category of HZ-modules is equivalent to Voevodsky’s\r
triangulated category of motives. A similar result holds for H-modules, where\r
one works with motives having coefficients in F2. A Tate motive, under this\r
equivalence, is an H-module equivalent to a wedge of modules of the form Σp,qH.\r
A proper Tate motive of weight ≥ n, in the sense of [V3, Def. 3.49], is a\r
Tate motive equivalent to a wedge of modules of the form Σp,qH where p ≥ 2q and\r
q ≥ n. The result [V3, Thm. 4.20(2)] states that the spectra H ∧Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n)\r
are proper Tate motives of weight ≥ n. From this we deduce the following:\r
Lemma 7.3. As a left H-module, H ∧ H is equivalent to a motivically finite type\r
wedge of H (with one summand for every admissible monomial in the motivic Steen\u0002rod algebra). In particular, π∗∗(H ∧ H) is free as an M2-module.\r
Proof. As a motivic spectrum, H is a directed homotopy colimit of desuspensions\r
of the spectra Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n). Precisely,\r
H ≃ hocolim nΣ\r
−2n,−nΣ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n),\r
where the maps in this hocolim come from the structure maps in the spectrum H.\r
It follows that H ∧ H is equivalent to\r
hocolim n\r
\u0002\r
Σ\r
−2n,−nH ∧ Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n)\r
\u0003\r
(7.4) ,\r
where the homotopy colimit is taken in the category of left H-modules. Since\r
each H ∧ Σ∞K(Z/2(n), 2n) is a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ n, its Σ−2n,−n\r
desuspension is a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ 0. By [V3, Prop. 3.65], the\r
homotopy colimit of (7.4) is therefore also a proper Tate motive of weight ≥ 0.\r
To complete the proof we consider the chain of isomorphisms\r
A\r
∗∗ = [H, Σ∗∗H] ∼= [H ∧ H, Σ∗∗H]H = [∨αΣnα H, Σ∗∗H]H =\r
Y\r
α\r
Σ\r
nα H∗∗\r
.\r
Here [−, −]H denotes maps in the homotopy category of left H-modules. The fact\r
that A is free on the admissible monomials tells us what the nα’s must be (and\r
that the above product is also a sum). \u0003\r
Proof of Proposition 7.2. If M is an H-module, there is a canonical map\r
θH,M : π∗,∗(M)\r
∼=−→ [Σ∗∗H, M]H → HomM2\r
([Σ∗∗M, H]H, M2).\r
The definition of the second map in the composite is completely analagous to the\r
definition of θX above. Moreover, when M has the form H ∧ X, the map θH,M is\r
naturally isomorphic to θX. So our goal is to show that θH,H∧H is an isomorphism.\r
It is clear that θH,M is an isomorphism when M = H, or more generally when\r
M is a motivically finite type wedge of suspensions of H. So by Lemma 7.3 this\r
applies for M = H ∧ H. \u0003

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 21\r
Our next goal is the following K¨unneth isomorphism:\r
Proposition 7.5. For any motivic spectrum A which admits a right H-module\r
structure, the natural K¨unneth map H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H) → H∗∗(A ∧ H) is an\r
isomorphism. In particular, the maps H∗∗(H)\r
⊗(s) → H∗∗(H∧(s)\r
) are isomorphisms\r
for every s (where the tensors are over M2).\r
This result is automatic if one believes that H is cellular in the sense of [DI2],\r
using the standard K¨unneth isomorphism for cellular objects [loc. cit]. The cel\u0002lularity of H has been claimed by Hopkins and Morel, but their proof has never\r
appeared. We will avoid this issue by instead proving the proposition in a way that\r
only uses the cellularity of H ∧ H as an H-module.\r
Consider the homotopy category of H-modules. Define the H-cellular spectra\r
to be the smallest full subcategory which contains H, is closed under arbitrary\r
wedges, and has the property that when A → B → C is a cofiber sequence and two\r
of the three terms are in the subcategory, so is the third. By Lemma 7.3, H ∧ H is\r
H-cellular as a left H-module.\r
Proof of Proposition 7.5. If A is any right H-module, then A∧ H ≃ A∧H (H ∧ H).\r
Since H∧H is a wedge of suspension of H’s, A∧H is therefore a wedge of suspensions\r
of A’s. It’s easy to now show that H∗∗(A ∧ H) ∼= H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H). \u0003\r
Let hSiH be the smallest full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy cate\u0002gory that satisfies the following properties:\r
(i) hSiH contains S;\r
(ii) If A → B → C is a cofiber sequence and two of the terms belong to hSiH,\r
then so does the third;\r
(iii) hSiH is closed under arbitrary wedges;\r
(iv) If A ∈ hSiH then A ∧ H is also in hSiH.\r
The smallest full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category that satisfies\r
(i)–(iii) is denoted hSi, and equals the category of cellular spectra of [DI2].\r
Lemma 7.6. For every A ∈ hSiH, the canonical maps H∗∗(A) ⊗M2 H∗∗(H∧(s)) →\r
H∗∗(A ∧ H∧(s)) are isomorphisms for every s.\r
Proof. Let D be the full subcategory of the motivic stable homotopy category\r
consisting of all objects A for which the maps in the statement of the lemma are\r
isomorphisms, for all s. It is evident that D satisfies properties (i)–(iii). The second\r
statement of Proposition 7.5 implies that D satisfies (iv) as well, so D contains\r
hSiH. \u0003"""

is itself a ring spectrum, then the cosimplicial object E• ∧ X (regarded without\r
codegeneracies) is a diagram of ring spectra. We may then take its homotopy\r
limit in the model category of motivic ring spectra, and we get something whose\r
underlying spectrum is equivalent to what we got by just taking the holim in motivic\r
spectra. This is a long way of saying that if X and E are both ring spectra then\r
via this holim we may build a model for X∧\r
E which is itself a ring spectrum.\r
Remark 7.9. If E is a ring spectrum and X is a module over E, then the cosimpli\u0002cial object of (7.8) admits a contracting homotopy. This shows that the canonical\r
map X → X∧\r
E is an equivalence in this case. We will make use of this fact in\r
Section 8 below.\r
Now we will specialize and take E = H. Let X be any motivic spectrum,\r
and write {Xs, Ws} for the canonical Adams tower just constructed. Note that\r
if X ∈ hSiH then by a simple induction we have that all the objects Xs and Ws\r
belong to hSiH as well.\r
Proposition 7.10. For any motivic spectrum X ∈ hSiH, the E2-term of the\r
homotopy spectral sequence for the tower {Xs, Ws} is naturally isomorphic to\r
ExtH∗∗H(M2, H∗∗(X)) (where this means Ext in the category of H∗∗H-comodules).

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 23\r
Proof. The object Ws is equal to H ∧ H\r
∧(s)\r
∧ X. It follows from Proposition 7.5\r
and an easy induction on s that\r
π∗(Ws) ∼= [H∗∗(H)]⊗(s) ⊗M2 H∗∗(X)\r
and\r
H∗∗(Ws) ∼= H∗∗H ⊗M2[H∗∗(H)]⊗(s) ⊗M2 H∗∗(X).\r
The usual arguments show that\r
0 → H∗∗(X) → H∗∗(W0) → H∗∗(W1) → H∗∗(W2) → · · ·\r
may be identified with the cobar resolution for H∗∗(X), and that the complex\r
0 → π∗∗(W0) → π∗∗(W1) → · · ·\r
may be identified with the complex obtained by applying HomH∗∗H(H∗∗, −) to the\r
cobar resolution. \u0003\r

in the standard way, as described in [Bo, Section 6]. That is, if lim1\r

Corollary 7.15. The cohomological motivic Adams spectral sequence for the sphere\r

THE MOTIVIC ADAMS SPECTRAL SEQUENCE 25\r
Proof. Let X = S. By the above results, our naively-constructed Adams spectral\r
sequence for S is the same (from E2 on) as the homotopy spectral sequence for the\r
tower {Cs}. The homotopy limit of this tower is S\r
∧\r
H, and the convergence properties\r
are as described in Remark 7.11. The evident vanishing line of the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence—which can be proven in exactly the same way as for the classical\r
case [A]—guarantees strong convergence. \u0003\r
Applying topological realization to the tower {Cs} for the motivic sphere spec\u0002trum yields the corresponding tower for the classical sphere spectrum. It follows\r
that there is a map from the topological realization of S\r

H to the spectrum (Scl)\r

In some sense our discussion below would be most natural if there exists a model\r
for BP L which is a symmetric ring spectrum, and where there is a map of symmetric\r
ring spectra BP L → H. This is not known, however, and it is stronger than what\r
we actually need. It turns out that all we really need are pairings BP L ∧ BP L →\r
BP L and BP L ∧ H → H which are unital on the nose, and that is easily arranged\r
for reasons we now explain.\r
First, one observes that the Quillen idempotent e: MGL(2) → MGL(2) is a map\r
of homotopy ring spectra (not a map of symmetric ring spectra). It is then easy\r
to see that there is a map µ: BP L ∧ BP L → BP L making BP L a homotopy ring\r
spectrum (not a symmetric ring spectrum) and such that MGL(2) → BP L is a\r
map of homotopy ring spectra. Choose a model for BP L which is fibrant as a\r
symmetric spectrum, and for which the unit (up to homotopy) of µ is a cofibration\r
S → BP L. The map (S ∧BP L)∨(BP L∧S) → BP L∧BP L is then a cofibration,\r
and so has the homotopy lifting property. The triangle\r

commutes up to homotopy, and therefore we may choose another multiplication\r
µ\r
′\r
: BP L ∧ BP L → BP L, homotopic to µ, so that the triangle commutes on the\r
nose.\r
Analogously, start with the Thom class BP L → H (induced from the Thom\r
class on MGL) and consider the composite map BP L ∧ H → H ∧ H → H. This\r
pairing is unital up to homotopy, and therefore by the same arguments as above\r
we can choose a homotopic pairing which is unital on the nose.\r
As a final prelude for the work in the next section, suppose E is a motivic\r
spectrum with a pairing E ∧ E → E that is unital on the nose (but where no\r
associativity assumptions are made). Then for any motivic spectrum X one may\r
form the cosimplicial object without codegeneracies\r
E ∧ X\r
/\r
/E ∧ E ∧ X\r
///E ∧ E ∧ E ∧ X\r
//\r
(8.2) //· · ·\r
The homotopy limit of this diagram may be modelled by a Tot-like object, defined\r
to be the mapping space from the standard cosimplicial simplex (without codegen\u0002eracies) ∆•\r
. By looking at the usual skeletal filtration of ∆• one defines Toti objects\r
as usual, and obtains a tower of fibrations whose limit is Tot. The homotopy fiber\r
of Toti → Toti−1 is Ωi(E∧(i) ∧ X).\r
The same arguments as usual (meaning in the true cosimplicial case, where there\r
are codegeneracies) show that this Tot-tower is an E-nilpotent resolution of X in\r
the sense of Bousfield [Bo, Def. 5.6], and therefore our Tot object is a model for\r
the E-nilpotent completion of X.\r
Finally, assume that there is a pairing E ∧ X → X which is unital on the\r
nose (but where again there is no associativity condition). This map then gives\r
a “contracting homotopy” in the cosimplicial object without codegeneracies (8.2).\r
The usual arguments show that X splits off every piece of the Tot-tower, and\r
its complementary summand in each Toti becomes null homotopic in Toti−1. One\r
shows that consequently the map X → Tot(E\r
•∧X) is a weak equivalence. In other\r
words, the same thing that works for cosimplicial objects in the case of pairings

abuse of terminology since there are no codegeneracies. The homotopy limit of\r
this bi-cosimplicial spectrum is a kind of “bi-completion”, which we will denote by\r
X∧\r
{BP L,H}\r
. We will only concern ourselves with X = S.\r

homotopy limits in one direction—with respect to n, say—and then taking the\r

It follows from the observations in the previous section that the maps H∧(k) →\r

BP L are all equivalences. Therefore the homotopy limit of (8.5) is equivalent\r

For each k, we may run the homological Adams spectral sequence for computing\r
the homotopy groups of (BP L∧(k))\r

that the E2-term of this spectral sequence has the expected description in terms of\r
Ext. Then by the same arguments as in classical topology, the spectral sequence\r
for computing π∗∗((BP L∧(k))\r
∧\r
H) is concentrated in even degrees, and therefore\r
collapses. For k = 1 this allows us to conclude that\r
π∗∗(BP L∧\r
H) ∼= Z(2)[τ, v1, v2, . . .],\r
and if we call the above ring V then for all k ≥ 1 we get\r
π∗∗((BP L∧(k))\r

Z(2) with Z(2)[τ], with the generators assigned appropriate weights. Unlike the\r

Comparing the two spectral sequences, we see that the groups they are converg\u0002ing to are in complete agreement through the 21-stem. An interesting difference\r
occurs in the 22-stem, however. To make what we are about to say easier to follow,\r
let us use the term “bound” to describe classes which are part of an h1-tower which\r
survives to E∞: e.g., the towers determined by h1, P\r
kh1 and Pk\r
c0 in the Adams\r
spectral sequence.\r
In the Adams spectral sequence we have three unbound classes surviving in\r
column 22: h2c1 (weight 13), c0d0 (weight 13), and P d0 (weight 12). In the Adams\u0002Novikov spectral sequence we only get two unbound survivors in the 22-stem, both\r

τ(c0d0) = P d0\r
in the homotopy groups of S\r

{H,BP L}\r
consists of M2 ⊕ M2 ⊕ M2/(τ) plus bound terms of higher weight, where\r
the first two generators are in weights 14 and 16, and the latter is in weight 15.\r
The only way this is consistent with the Adams spectral sequence is if we indeed\r
have the Adams differential d2([h3g]) = h\r

H ) and π14,8(S\r
∧\r
H) which are\r
detected by c0 and d0 in the motivic Adams spectral sequence. It must be that\r
ψ(ǫM) = ǫ and ψ(κM ) = κ, where ψ: πp,q(S\r
∧\r
H) → πp(S)\r
∧\r
2\r
is our map from the end\r
of Section 7.12 (because ψ(ǫM ) is detected by c0 in the classical Adams spectral\r
sequence, etc.)\r
The product ǫMκM is detected by c0d0, which is nonzero in the motivic Adams\r
spectral sequence. We discovered in the last section that there is a hidden τ\u0002extension in π22,∗(S\r
∧\r
H), telling us that τ ·(ǫM κM) gives the generator in π22,12(S\r
∧\r
H).\r
But this generator is detected by P d0, and so the same remains true upon applying\r
ψ. That is, ψ(τ · ǫM κM) is nonzero and detected by P d0. Recall that ψ is a map\r
of ring spectra, and ψ(τ) = 1. So ψ(τ · ǫM κM) = ǫκ, and we are done. \u0003\r
Again, Proposition 8.9 is a known result in algebraic topology. It is implicit,\r
for instance, in the homotopy groups of tmf as given in [Ba, Prop. 7.2(5)] (this\r
was explained to us by Mark Behrens). Still, our motivic proof is very simple, only\r
depending on the algebraic computation of the motivic Adams and Adams-Novikov\r
E2-terms and a comparison of differentials.
