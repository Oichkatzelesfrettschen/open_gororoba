Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quan\u0002tum technologies. The demand for integrability and\r
multi-functionality suggests ‘flat’ platforms - ultrathin\r
layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs.\r
With the success in demonstrating spontaneous paramet\u0002ric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an al\u0002ternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous\r
four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest.\r
In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear sus\u0002ceptibility χ\r
(2)\r
, SFWM can generate photon pairs both\r
directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility\r
χ\r
(3)\r
, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic\r
generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cas\u0002caded process is more efficient. Here, we show that\r
in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the\r
wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than\r
for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement\r
the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order\r
nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN).\r
The existence of both second- and third-order nonlin\u0002ear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum\r
state engineering.\r

1. INTRODUCTION\r
Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) - a second\u0002order nonlinear process where a single pump photon splits into a\r
pair of daughter photons - is widely used to generate entangled\r
photons in bulk crystals and waveguides. During the last few\r
years, SPDC has been also implemented in micro- and nanoscale\r
nonlinear layers [1–12]. Due to their tiny thickness, such layers\r
satisfy the SPDC phase-matching automatically, even though\r
the wavevector mismatch ∆k can be very large. As a result,\r
materials with high second-order susceptibility χ\r
(2)\r
, or orienta\u0002tions using large components of the χˆ\r
(2)\r
tensor, which normally\r
are excluded from SPDC because of phase-matching restriction,\r
come into play. Although, because of the small thickness, such\r
sources produce photon pairs at low rates – up to a few kHz so\r
far [12, 13] – their advantage is multifunctionality. For example,\r
a thin layer can generate photon pairs not only forwards, but\r
also backwards and bidirectionally [14]; by tuning the pump\r
polarization, the polarization state and the degree of entangle\u0002ment of the photon pairs can be also tuned [3, 6]; the pump\r
wavelength and direction can be chosen arbitrarily.\r
The variety of materials used to generate entangled photons\r
through SPDC is quickly expanding. Most promising are van\u0002der-Waals crystals [4, 6, 8, 10], whose nonlinearity can be con\u0002trolled by stacking several atomic layers in different ways [15].\r
Recently, entangled photons were generated in a liquid crys\u0002tal [13, 16], which offers new ways to control the properties of\r
entangled photons: through molecular orientation twist and by\r
applying electric field.\r
An alternative way to generate photon pairs is the sponta\u0002neous four-wave mixing (SFWM), where two pump photons\r
are converted into a pair of entangled photons and the third\u0002order susceptibility χ\r
(3)\r
is involved. Since χ\r
(3)\r
is nonzero in any\r
material, the material choice becomes broader. An important\r
advantage of SFWM is that it generates entangled photons on\r
both sides of the pump spectral line. This allows one of the pho\u0002tons to cover blue or even UV range of wavelengths [17] without\r
using even more blue-shifted pump. During the last few years,\r
considerable efforts to implement SFWM in ‘flat’ sources have\r
been made. However, due to the weakness of the third-order\r
nonlinear interaction compared to the second-order one, most of\r
the experiments on SFWM in thin sources are carried out in the\r
seeded regime [18–22], where a coherent beam at the frequency\r
of one of the output photons is stimulating the process. So far,\r
there are only two experiments on photon pair generation via\r
SFWM in thin layers [23, 24].\r
Meanwhile, SFWM can also take place in non\u0002centrosymmetric materials, where both χ\r
(2) and χ(3) are\r
present. Such materials were so far avoided in SFWM experi\u0002ments. In the absence of the phase-matching restriction, a direct\r
third-order nonlinear process should compete with a cascaded\r
process. For example, the third harmonic can be generated not\r
only directly but also through the second harmonic generation\r
(SHG) followed by sum frequency generation. This cascaded\r
arXiv:2601.23137v1 [physics.optics] 30 Jan 2026

Letter 2\r
process is well-studied, both theoretically and experimen\u0002tally [25, 26]. Similarly, both cascaded and direct nonlinear\r
processes can generate photon pairs at a certain wavelength\r
set ωs (signal) and ωi(idler). In the cascaded process, first,\r
the pump at ωp is up-converted to the second harmonic\r
(ωp + ωp → ωSH), and then the second harmonic (SH) photons\r
are down-converted through SPDC: ωSH → ωs + ωi. The direct\r
process generates photon pairs through SFWM: 2ωp → ωs + ωi.\r
The cascaded process is commonly considered to be stronger\r
compared to the direct one. However, its phase-matching\r
condition is more restrictive than that of the direct process.\r
In this work, we show that in a thin nonlinear layer, the direct\r
process is always stronger. To demonstrate this effect experi\u0002mentally, we use a 10 µm-thick lithium niobate (LN) crystal and\r
generate photon pairs through SFWM.\r
2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\r
For the photon pair measurement, we use a Hanbury Brown\u0002Twiss setup separating the entangled photon in two arms. Fig\u0002ure 1 shows the scheme of the experimental setup. A laser at\r
Fig. 1. Experimental setup: lens L1 focuses the pump on\r
the LN sample; signal (visible, shown in blue) and idler (IR,\r
shown in orange) photons are collimated by lens L2, separated\r
by dichroic mirror DM, and coupled into detectors D1, D2 by\r
lenses L3, L4, respectively. Their polarization is analyzed by\r
an HWP and a PBS in each arm. Filter F1 eliminates unwanted\r
wavelengths in the pump beam, and bandpass filters F2, F3\r
select the signal and idler photon detection bands. Photon\r
detection events are registered by a time tagger triggered by\r
pulses from the laser.\r
1030 nm, with a pulse duration of 210 fs and a repetition rate\r
of 1.023 MHz, is used as the pump. Its power and polarization\r
are controlled by two half-wave plates (HWPs) and a polarizing\r
beam splitter (PBS). A band-pass filter (F1) at 1030 nm with 10\r
nm bandwidth filters out unwanted wavelengths. The pump is\r
focused by lens L1 into a 100 µm spot on the 10 µm-thick x-cut\r
LN layer on a 500 µm-thick fused silica substrate, and the output\r
photons are collimated by lens L2 with the focal length 100 mm\r
and NA=0.5. The collected photons are separated by a long-pass\r
dichroic mirror (DM) with the cut-off wavelength at 950 nm. The\r
visible (reflected) and IR (transmitted) photons are coupled to\r
the multi-mode fibers at the end of each arm by lenses L3 and\r
L4, respectively. At each arm, an HWP and a PBS are installed\r
to analyze the polarization of the photons. The detection wave\u0002lengths are selected by band-pass filters F2 (770 nm with 10 nm\r
band width) and F3 (1550 nm with 50 nm band width), respec\u0002tively. The coupled photons are sent to single-photon detectors\r
D1 (Perkin&Elmer, SPCM-AQRH-16-FC) and D2 (IDQ, ID220),\r
respectively. The detection events are triggered by the electric\r
pulses of the laser and registered by the time tagger.\r
3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\r
Figure 2 shows the experimental results. The pump power de\u0002pendences of the mean photon numbers per pulse for visible and\r
IR photons, ⟨Nvis⟩ and ⟨NIR⟩, are plotted in panel (a) with blue\r
circles and red triangles, respectively. The visible and IR photons\r

as a function of the pump power, with a fitting curve.\r
exhibit different dependences on the pump power, one quadratic\r
and the other linear. The quadratic power dependence is indeed\r
expected for SFWM. Meanwhile, the linear power scaling of the\r
IR photons rate with the pump can be explained by SPDC. In\u0002deed, under pumping at 1030 nm, SPDC in thin LN can generate\r
signal photons at 1550 nm, with their idler counterparts being at\r
3.078 µm. The coherence length for this process is 15 µm, longer\r
than the sample thickness. While the idler photons cannot be\r
detected by our setup, the signal photons generation rate should\r
be much higher than the SFWM rate. Consequently, the domi\u0002nant contribution to the rate of IR photons is from SPDC, which\r
scales linearly with the pump power. Importantly, SPDC cannot\r
affect the coincidence detection in our experiment because the\r
idler SPDC photons are not detected in the visible arm.\r
Since the strongest components of LN second- and third\u0002order nonlinear susceptibility tensors are χ\r
(2)\r
zzz and χ\r
(3)\r
zzzz, respec\u0002tively, both SPDC and SFWM are most efficient if the pump and\r
the output photons are all polarized along the z axis. Indeed, the\r
photon count rates are maximal for the pump polarized along\r
the z axis (see Supplement 1). Also, from Fig. 2(b), where the po\u0002larization dependences of ⟨Nvis⟩ and ⟨NIR⟩ are plotted, we see\r
that both visible and IR photons are polarized the same way as\r
the pump. For visible photons, this is evidence that they mostly\r
come from SFWM and not from two-photon photoluminescence.\r
Figure 2(c) shows the mean number of coincidences per pulse\r
⟨Ncc⟩ as a function of the pump power. The dependence is\r
quadratic, as expected for SFWM. The efficiency of pair gener\u0002ation is much lower than the one measured in SiN films using

Letter 3\r
the same pump [24]; however, higher rates can be achieved\r
because of the high damage threshold of LN at 1030 nm. The\r
second-order correlation function g\r
(2)\r
, calculated as\r
g\r
(2)\r
(0) = ⟨Ncc⟩\r
⟨Nvis⟩⟨NIR⟩\r
, (1)\r
is plotted in panel (d). The fitting curve is g\r
(2) = 1 + a/P2\r
,\r
where a is a fitting parameter and P is the pump power. The g\r
(2)\r
exceeding the ‘thermal’ value 2 and its inverse dependence on\r
the mean photon number of SFWM (scaling as P\r
2\r
) indicate the\r
detection of correlated photon pairs.\r
Importantly, the fused silica substrate could also contribute\r
to SFWM, due to its noticeable χ\r
(3) = 3 × 10−22 m2/V2\r
[27] and\r
large length. Its contribution can be estimated from these param\u0002eters and the phase matching condition (see the Supplementary\r
Information) as 25% of the total rate of coincidences.\r
So far, it was not clear if the observed photon pairs are gen\u0002erated through the direct or cascaded process. To figure out\r
the contribution of the cascaded process, we first investigated\r
the efficiency of its second stage. To this end, using the same\r
setup, we detected photon pairs from SPDC pumped at 515 nm.\r
The pump was prepared by frequency-doubling the 1030 nm\r
radiation in a bulk phase-matched BBO crystal installed after F1\r
(see Fig. 1). Further, knowing the efficiency of SHG from the LN\r
layer, we estimated ⟨Ncc⟩ stemming from the cascaded process.\r

Figure 3 shows the correlation measurement results for SPDC\r
in the same LN layer, pumped at 515 nm. The mean number of\r
coincidences per pulse ⟨Ncc⟩ is plotted as a function of pump\r
power with a linear fitting curve in panel (a). Panel (b) shows\r
the correlation function g\r
(2)\r
, calculated according to Eq. 1, with\r
the fitting curve g\r
(2) = 1 + a/P. Meanwhile, the SHG efficiency\r
of the LN layer is evaluated by measuring the pump and SH\r
powers after the sample. The measured conversion efficiency is\r
2 × 10−2%/W: pumping with 400 mW at 1030 nm yields 30 µW\r
of SH. Based on this measurement, under 400 mW pumping the\r
cascaded process generates 4 × 10−8 pairs per pulse, which is\r
only 5% of the total rate of photon pairs.\r
4. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\r
To describe the cascaded and direct processes theoretically, con\u0002sider first their phase-matching functions\r
F(L) = Lsinc∆kL\r
2\r
, (2)\r
where ∆k is the wavevector mismatch and L the crystal length.\r
Figure 4 shows [F(L)]2for each of the three involved processes:\r
SFWM generating 770 nm / 1550 nm photon pairs from 1030 nm\r
pump (green solid line), SHG from 1030 nm (blue dot-dashed\r
line), and SPDC generating 770 nm / 1550 nm photon pairs\r
from 515 nm pump (red dashed line). For each process, the\r
phase matching function oscillates (Maker fringes), reaching\r
maxima at odd numbers of the nonlinear coherence length\r
Lcoh = π/|∆k|. The nonlinear coherence lengths for the three\r
processes are 33.3 µm, 3.1 µm, and 3.4 µm, respectively; there\u0002fore, the efficiencies of both steps of the cascaded process should\r
oscillate faster than the efficiency of direct SFWM. Moreover,\r
because the peak values of F\r
2\r
(L) scale inversely with ∆k\r
2\r
, they\r
are much lower for SHG and SPDC than for SFWM. This already\r
gives a qualitative explanation for the effect we see: because\r
|∆kSFWM| = |∆kSHG| − |∆kSPDC| ≪ |∆kSHG|, |∆kSPDC|, the\r
phase-matching function of SFWM considerably exceeds the\r
ones of SHG and SPDC.\r

dashed line) as functions of the crystal length. (b) Calculated\r

For an accurate comparison, we consider both second-order\r
processes, SHG and SPDC, occurring simultaneously. Assuming\r
a non-depleted pump, the electric field amplitude of the SH\r
generated from the pump propagating along the x-direction is\r

Omitting the common factors in Eqs. (5,7), we see that the rates\r
of pair generation through the cascaded and direct processes are,\r
respectively, Rcas ∝\r
4\r
9\r
|Acas|\r
2 and Rdir ∝\r
9\r
16 |Adir|\r
2\r
.\r
Figure 4 (b) shows these rates as functions of the crystal\r
length: in green solid line for the direct process and in blue\r
dot-dashed line for the cascaded process. For the calculation, we\r
used the values of χ\r
(2) = 2.5 × 10−11 m/V [31] and χ\r
(3)\r
SFWM =\r
1.5 × 10−20 m2/V2[32]. The rates oscillate with the same period,\r
equal to twice the coherence length of the SFWM process. This is\r
because the first term in the square brackets of Eq. (6) dominates,\r
see Fig. 4(b). At 10 µm thickness, the ratio Rcas/Rdir is 0.048,\r
which is in good correspondence to the experimental result.\r
If the cascaded process has the phase matching satisfied for\r
both its stages (i.e., through periodic poling), it should be more\r
efficient than direct SFWM. Note that for ∆kSH = ∆kSPDC = 0,\r
the field in Eq. (3) scales as z, which leads to Eq. (6) scaling as\r
L\r
2\r
instead of L. But here we see that without phase matching\r
satisfied, SHG and SPDC have larger wavevector mismatches\r
than SPDC, which makes the cascaded process less efficient than\r
the direct one.\r
SFWM in thin second-order nonlinear films can considerably\r
enrich the toolbox of ’flat’ quantum optics. In high-χ\r
(2)\r
semicon\u0002ductors, such as GaAs or AlGaAs, it can produce photon pairs\r
with one of the photons above the bandgap, which is impossible\r
through SPDC. Moreover, as we show above, a second-order\r
nonlinear film pumped at frequency ωp can simultaneously gen\u0002erate photon pairs at frequencies ωs and ωi\r
through SFWM, but\r
also at frequencies ωi and ωp − ωithrough SPDC. This simulta\u0002neous action of two coherently pumped nonlinear effects can be\r
used for building interesting quantum superpositions.\r

Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quan\u0002tum technologies. The demand for integrability and\r
multi-functionality suggests ‘flat’ platforms - ultrathin\r
layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs.\r
With the success in demonstrating spontaneous paramet\u0002ric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an al\u0002ternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous\r
four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest.\r
In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear sus\u0002ceptibility χ\r
(2)\r
, SFWM can generate photon pairs both\r
directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility\r
χ\r
(3)\r
, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic\r
generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cas\u0002caded process is more efficient. Here, we show that\r
in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the\r
wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than\r
for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement\r
the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order\r
nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN).\r
The existence of both second- and third-order nonlin\u0002ear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum\r
state engineering.\r

Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) - a second\u0002order nonlinear process where a single pump photon splits into a\r
pair of daughter photons - is widely used to generate entangled\r
photons in bulk crystals and waveguides. During the last few\r
years, SPDC has been also implemented in micro- and nanoscale\r
nonlinear layers [1–12]. Due to their tiny thickness, such layers\r
satisfy the SPDC phase-matching automatically, even though\r
the wavevector mismatch ∆k can be very large. As a result,\r
materials with high second-order susceptibility χ\r
(2)\r
, or orienta\u0002tions using large components of the χˆ\r
(2)\r
tensor, which normally\r
are excluded from SPDC because of phase-matching restriction,\r
come into play. Although, because of the small thickness, such\r
sources produce photon pairs at low rates – up to a few kHz so\r
far [12, 13] – their advantage is multifunctionality. For example,\r
a thin layer can generate photon pairs not only forwards, but\r
also backwards and bidirectionally [14]; by tuning the pump\r
polarization, the polarization state and the degree of entangle\u0002ment of the photon pairs can be also tuned [3, 6]; the pump\r
wavelength and direction can be chosen arbitrarily.\r
The variety of materials used to generate entangled photons\r
through SPDC is quickly expanding. Most promising are van\u0002der-Waals crystals [4, 6, 8, 10], whose nonlinearity can be con\u0002trolled by stacking several atomic layers in different ways [15].\r
Recently, entangled photons were generated in a liquid crys\u0002tal [13, 16], which offers new ways to control the properties of\r
entangled photons: through molecular orientation twist and by\r
applying electric field.\r
An alternative way to generate photon pairs is the sponta\u0002neous four-wave mixing (SFWM), where two pump photons\r
are converted into a pair of entangled photons and the third\u0002order susceptibility χ\r
(3)\r
is involved. Since χ\r
(3)\r
is nonzero in any\r
material, the material choice becomes broader. An important\r
advantage of SFWM is that it generates entangled photons on\r
both sides of the pump spectral line. This allows one of the pho\u0002tons to cover blue or even UV range of wavelengths [17] without\r
using even more blue-shifted pump. During the last few years,\r
considerable efforts to implement SFWM in ‘flat’ sources have\r
been made. However, due to the weakness of the third-order\r
nonlinear interaction compared to the second-order one, most of\r
the experiments on SFWM in thin sources are carried out in the\r
seeded regime [18–22], where a coherent beam at the frequency\r
of one of the output photons is stimulating the process. So far,\r
there are only two experiments on photon pair generation via\r
SFWM in thin layers [23, 24].\r
Meanwhile, SFWM can also take place in non\u0002centrosymmetric materials, where both χ\r
(2) and χ(3) are\r
present. Such materials were so far avoided in SFWM experi\u0002ments. In the absence of the phase-matching restriction, a direct\r
third-order nonlinear process should compete with a cascaded\r
process. For example, the third harmonic can be generated not\r
only directly but also through the second harmonic generation\r
(SHG) followed by sum frequency generation. This cascaded\r
arXiv:2601.23137v1 [physics.optics] 30 Jan 2026

Letter 2\r
process is well-studied, both theoretically and experimen\u0002tally [25, 26]. Similarly, both cascaded and direct nonlinear\r
processes can generate photon pairs at a certain wavelength\r
set ωs (signal) and ωi(idler). In the cascaded process, first,\r
the pump at ωp is up-converted to the second harmonic\r
(ωp + ωp → ωSH), and then the second harmonic (SH) photons\r
are down-converted through SPDC: ωSH → ωs + ωi. The direct\r
process generates photon pairs through SFWM: 2ωp → ωs + ωi.\r
The cascaded process is commonly considered to be stronger\r
compared to the direct one. However, its phase-matching\r
condition is more restrictive than that of the direct process.\r
In this work, we show that in a thin nonlinear layer, the direct\r
process is always stronger. To demonstrate this effect experi\u0002mentally, we use a 10 µm-thick lithium niobate (LN) crystal and\r
generate photon pairs through SFWM."""

For the photon pair measurement, we use a Hanbury Brown\u0002Twiss setup separating the entangled photon in two arms. Fig\u0002ure 1 shows the scheme of the experimental setup. A laser at\r

by dichroic mirror DM, and coupled into detectors D1, D2 by\r
lenses L3, L4, respectively. Their polarization is analyzed by\r
an HWP and a PBS in each arm. Filter F1 eliminates unwanted\r
wavelengths in the pump beam, and bandpass filters F2, F3\r
select the signal and idler photon detection bands. Photon\r
detection events are registered by a time tagger triggered by\r
pulses from the laser.\r
1030 nm, with a pulse duration of 210 fs and a repetition rate\r

are controlled by two half-wave plates (HWPs) and a polarizing\r
beam splitter (PBS). A band-pass filter (F1) at 1030 nm with 10\r

focused by lens L1 into a 100 µm spot on the 10 µm-thick x-cut\r
LN layer on a 500 µm-thick fused silica substrate, and the output\r
photons are collimated by lens L2 with the focal length 100 mm\r

exhibit different dependences on the pump power, one quadratic\r
and the other linear. The quadratic power dependence is indeed\r
expected for SFWM. Meanwhile, the linear power scaling of the\r
IR photons rate with the pump can be explained by SPDC. In\u0002deed, under pumping at 1030 nm, SPDC in thin LN can generate\r
signal photons at 1550 nm, with their idler counterparts being at\r
3.078 µm. The coherence length for this process is 15 µm, longer\r
than the sample thickness. While the idler photons cannot be\r
detected by our setup, the signal photons generation rate should\r
be much higher than the SFWM rate. Consequently, the domi\u0002nant contribution to the rate of IR photons is from SPDC, which\r
scales linearly with the pump power. Importantly, SPDC cannot\r
affect the coincidence detection in our experiment because the\r
idler SPDC photons are not detected in the visible arm.\r
Since the strongest components of LN second- and third\u0002order nonlinear susceptibility tensors are χ\r
(2)\r
zzz and χ\r
(3)\r
zzzz, respec\u0002tively, both SPDC and SFWM are most efficient if the pump and\r
the output photons are all polarized along the z axis. Indeed, the\r
photon count rates are maximal for the pump polarized along\r
the z axis (see Supplement 1). Also, from Fig. 2(b), where the po\u0002larization dependences of ⟨Nvis⟩ and ⟨NIR⟩ are plotted, we see\r
that both visible and IR photons are polarized the same way as\r
the pump. For visible photons, this is evidence that they mostly\r
come from SFWM and not from two-photon photoluminescence.\r
Figure 2(c) shows the mean number of coincidences per pulse\r
⟨Ncc⟩ as a function of the pump power. The dependence is\r
quadratic, as expected for SFWM. The efficiency of pair gener\u0002ation is much lower than the one measured in SiN films using

the same pump [24]; however, higher rates can be achieved\r
because of the high damage threshold of LN at 1030 nm. The\r

(2)\r
exceeding the ‘thermal’ value 2 and its inverse dependence on\r
the mean photon number of SFWM (scaling as P\r
2\r
) indicate the\r
detection of correlated photon pairs.\r
Importantly, the fused silica substrate could also contribute\r
to SFWM, due to its noticeable χ\r
(3) = 3 × 10−22 m2/V2\r
[27] and\r
large length. Its contribution can be estimated from these param\u0002eters and the phase matching condition (see the Supplementary\r
Information) as 25% of the total rate of coincidences.\r
So far, it was not clear if the observed photon pairs are gen\u0002erated through the direct or cascaded process. To figure out\r
the contribution of the cascaded process, we first investigated\r
the efficiency of its second stage. To this end, using the same\r
setup, we detected photon pairs from SPDC pumped at 515 nm.\r
The pump was prepared by frequency-doubling the 1030 nm\r
radiation in a bulk phase-matched BBO crystal installed after F1\r
(see Fig. 1). Further, knowing the efficiency of SHG from the LN\r
layer, we estimated ⟨Ncc⟩ stemming from the cascaded process.\r

the correlation function g\r

the fitting curve g\r
(2) = 1 + a/P. Meanwhile, the SHG efficiency\r
of the LN layer is evaluated by measuring the pump and SH\r
powers after the sample. The measured conversion efficiency is\r
2 × 10−2%/W: pumping with 400 mW at 1030 nm yields 30 µW\r
of SH. Based on this measurement, under 400 mW pumping the\r
cascaded process generates 4 × 10−8 pairs per pulse, which is\r
only 5% of the total rate of photon pairs."""
