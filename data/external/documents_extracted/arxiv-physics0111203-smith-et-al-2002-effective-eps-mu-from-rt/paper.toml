We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix \r
simulations on finite lengths of electromagnetic metamaterials, to determine the effective \r
permittivity (ε) and permeability (µ). We perform this analysis on structures composed of \r
periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators (SRRs) and both wires and SRRs. We find \r
the recovered frequency-dependent ε and µ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions \r
predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium \r
exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of ε is negative, and SRRs produce a \r
frequency region in which the real part of µ is negative. In the combination structure, at \r
frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ε and µ are simultaneously negative, the real \r
part of the index-of-refraction is found also to be unambiguously negative. \r

It has been proposed that electromagnetic \r
metamaterials—composite structured materials, formed \r
from either periodic or random arrays of scattering \r
elements—should respond to electromagnetic radiation \r
as continuous materials, at least in the long wavelength \r
limit [1,2]. In recent experiments and simulations [3,4], \r
it has been demonstrated that certain metamaterial \r
configurations exhibit scattering behavior consistent \r
with the assumption of approximate frequency\u0002dependent forms for ε and µ. However, the techniques \r
applied in those studies probed the materials indirectly, \r
and did not provide an explicit measurement that would \r
assign values for ε and µ. It is our aim in this paper to \r
show that the previous conjectures were indeed valid: \r
unambiguous values for ε and µ can be applied to \r
electromagnetic metamaterials. Our approach here \r
utilizes the transmission and reflection coefficients (S\u0002parameters, equivalently) calculated for a wave \r
normally incident on a finite slab of metamaterial. We \r
invert the scattering data to determine n and z, for \r
systems of several thicknesses, from which we obtain \r
self-consistent values for ε and µ. While we utilize \r
simulation data in this study, the technique we describe \r
will be readily applicable to the experimental \r
characterization of metamaterial samples whenever the \r
scattering parameters are known. \r
The common method of characterizing the \r
electromagnetic scattering properties of a homogeneous \r
material is to identify its impedance (z) and refractive \r
index (n) [5,6]. While it is possible to completely \r
specify the scattering in terms of z and n, it is often \r
more convenient to choose a second set of analytic \r
variables that carry a direct material interpretation. \r
These variables are the electric permittivity ε=n/z, and \r
the magnetic permeability µ=nz. Both n and z, and \r
therefore ε and µ, are frequency-dependent complex \r
functions that satisfy certain requirements based on \r
causality. For passive materials, Re(z) and Im(n) must \r
be greater than zero. \r
At a given frequency, any material that supports \r
only one propagating mode will generally exhibit a \r
well-defined refractive index n, whether the material is \r
continuous or not. Photonic band gap materials, for \r
example, are characterized by dispersion curves from \r
which an effective index can extracted, even for bands \r
well above the first band gap, and well-defined \r
refraction phenomena can result [7,8,9]. However, it is \r
generally not possible to assign an impedance (z) to a \r
non-continuous material, except in those cases where \r
the wavelength in the material is much larger than the \r
dimensions and spacing of the constituent scattering \r
elements that compose the medium. If z depends \r
strongly on the surface termination, or if z depends on \r
the overall size of the sample, then z is ambiguous, and \r
it is not possible to assign intrinsic values for ε and µ. \r
The transmission coefficient for waves incident \r
normally to the face of a 1-D slab of continuous \r
material (in vacuum) with length d is related to n and z \r

where k=ω/c is the wavenumber of the incident wave. \r
The incident wave is assumed to travel rightward along \r
the positive x-axis, with the origin defined as the first \r
face of the material seen by the radiation. To improve \r
the clarity of the subsequent formulas, we introduce the \r
normalized transmission coefficient t’=exp(ikd)t. The \r

Note that while the expressions for n and z are \r
relatively uncomplicated, they are complex functions \r
with multiple branches, the interpretation of which can \r
lead to ambiguities in determining the final expressions \r
for ε and µ. We can resolve these ambiguities by \r
making use of additional knowledge about the material. \r
For example, if the material is passive, the requirement \r
that Re(z)>0 fixes the choice of sign in Eq. 4. \r

where m is an integer. When d is large, these branches \r
can lie arbitrarily close to one another, making the \r
selection of the correct branch difficult in the case of \r
dispersive materials. For this reason best results are \r
obtained for the smallest possible thickness of sample, \r
as has commonly been known in the analysis of \r
continuous materials. Even with a small sample, more \r
than one thickness must be measured to identify the \r
correct branch(es) of the solution which yields \r
consistently the same values for n. Note that the \r
requirement that Im(n)>0 uniquely identifies the sign of \r
Re(n), which is essential when the material may \r
potentially have regions which are left-handed—that is, \r
materials in which Re(n) may be negative. \r
In order to demonstrate the validity of assigning \r
bulk permeability and permittivity values to non \r
continuous metamaterials, we utilize simulation data \r
generated by the transfer matrix method (TMM) [10,11] \r
on three types of structures: a medium composed of a \r
periodic array of wires, a medium composed of a \r
periodic array of split ring resonators (SRRs), and a \r
medium composed by interleaving the wire and the \r
SRR arrays. We simulate one unit cell of a given \r
system using periodic boundary conditions in the \r
directions perpendicular to the propagation direction. \r
The TMM represents a complete solution of Maxwell’s \r
equations, and differs from Eqs. (1) and (2) in that the \r
exact details of the scattering elements are taken into \r
account. In the embedding medium, all eigenvalues of \r
the TM can be found analytically [12]. We find that in \r
the frequency range of interest and for the incoming \r
wave perpendicular to the sample surface, there is only \r
one propagating mode. All other modes are evanescent, \r
so that the systems considered are effectively one\u0002dimensional and we are justified utilizing Eqs. (5) and \r
(6), in which t’ and r represent the transmission and \r
reflection for this propagating mode. In the calculations \r
presented here, cells were meshed with 15x11x15 grid \r
points, in a manner described in Ref. 11. In the \r
formulation of the TMM used here, the metal dielectric \r
function is approximated by ε=-1000 + 18,000i, for all \r
frequencies. A larger value of the imaginary part of the \r
dielectric function for the metal results in lowered \r
absorption, but does not change the qualitative picture \r
presented here. \r
A square array of conducting wires, based on \r
effective medium arguments, is expected to exhibit the 

PREPRINT Page 3 2/13/2002 \r
3\r
ideal frequency-dependent plasmonic form of ε=1-\r
ωco2\r
/ω2, where ωco is a cutoff frequency [1]. Fig. 1 \r
shows the permittivity recovered from simulation data \r
for an array of wires, continuous along the E-polarized \r
direction of the incident wave, and with lattice constant \r
5 mm. The figure shows data for one, three, and five \r
layers of lattice in the propagation direction. A fit to the \r
resulting curves indicates a cutoff frequency of \r
ωp/2π=22.3 GHz, consistent with that determined by the \r
noting the onset of transmission (not shown), with a \r
frequency dependence indistinguishable from the three \r
and five row curves. The recovered permeability was \r
found to be unity at all frequencies. \r
While there is no ambiguity in determining the \r
phase of the transmitted wave, the phase of the reflected \r
wave must be measured relative to a reference plane \r
that is considered to be at the first face of the material. \r
Given that metamaterials generally do not have well\u0002defined surfaces, the question arises as to where this \r
reference plane should be located. A definite answer \r
can be obtained in the case of the wire structure, where \r
it is reasonable to assume that the reference plane \r
coincides with the first plane of the wires. We found \r
that with this choice of reference plane, the relation \r
z(ω)=1/n(ω) holds, consistent with the response of the \r
wire medium being entirely electric (i.e., µ=1). For the \r
SRR medium, the choice of reference plane was not \r
found to be critical; for the combined structure, \r
however, the wires dominate the scattering, and the \r
reference plane was again chosen to coincide with the \r
first plane of wires. \r
A second ambiguity that arises is the effective unit cell \r
length that will result in values of ε and µ that do not \r
depend on the overall length of the structure. \r
Empirically, we find in the three cases investigated that \r
the correct length corresponds to the number of unit \r
cells multiplied by the length of each unit cell. This can \r
be seen in Fig. 1, where the analysis of different lengths \r
of the wire medium results in the same permittivity; \r
only for a wire medium consisting of one layer is there \r
a noticeable deviation from the “bulk” behavior. It \r
should be noted that the unit cells analyzed here are \r
square, and thus the unit cell length is implicit in the \r
calculation by virtue of the spacing between elements in \r
the direction perpendicular to propagation. The fact \r
that even one unit cell in the propagation direction \r
produces nearly the same scattering parameters as a \r
thicker material may therefore not be so unexpected. \r
Fig. 2 shows the real and imaginary parts of the \r
permeability for a medium composed of only SRRs, as \r
configured in Ref. [11]. The dark solid curves are taken \r
from the simulation data, while the dashed curves are \r
from transmission and reflection coefficients computed \r
for a uniform material with a permeability \r

especially if the elements are resonant. In Fig. 3, we \r
plot the recovered frequency-dependent permittivity \r
corresponding to the SRR medium, which is significant \r
over the frequency range covered. \r
The result of combining a wire medium with an \r
SRR medium is shown in Fig. 4, in which we compare \r
the real parts of the recovered permittivity and \r
permeability from the combined structure with that \r
from either the wire or the SRR medium alone. The \r
solid curves are from the combined structure, while the \r
dashed curves are from either medium alone. \r
Consistent with what is observed in other calculations, \r
as well as experiments, the addition of the wires to the \r
SRR medium does not impact the permeability \r
properties of the SRR medium. However, the \r
combination of the SRRs and wires results in a \r
permittivity that is less negative than that for wires \r
alone. \r
It was first theoretically suggested by Veselago \r
[13] that an incoming wave incident on an interface \r
between vacuum and material with simultaneously \r
negative Re(ε) and Re(µ) would be refracted to the \r
same side of the normal to the interface. By \r
considering the analytic properties of the refractive \r
index in such a medium, it was shown that the refractive \r
index n must, in fact, be negative wherever ε and µ are \r
both negative [14]. In a recent experiment [4], a \r
metamaterial formed by combining a wire medium with \r
a SRR medium, qualitatively similar to those simulated \r
here, was used to demonstrate negative refraction, and \r
the angle of refraction was utilized to recover n as a \r
function of frequency. While a refraction experiment is \r
a useful method to measure the index, we can also \r
obtain this information directly and unambiguously \r
using Eq. 3, as shown in Fig. 5. If one has access to \r
phase information in the transmission and reflection \r
coefficients, one can identify both the magnitude and \r
sign of the refractive index from direct incidence \r
measurements on a planar slab. \r
We have demonstrated that the traditional \r
procedure of obtaining material parameters from \r
transmission/reflection data can be successfully applied \r
to metamaterials, subject to the possible ambiguities of \r
the definition of the first surface of the measured \r
sample, and the sample length. The former ambiguity \r
can be resolved in certain cases by using additional \r
information about the material, as shown in the case for \r
the wire medium above. In cases for which it is not \r
possible to determine the correct position of the \r
scattering surface, the range of possible solutions \r
corresponding to the various possible surfaces \r
throughout the unit cell will place bounds on the \r
possible values of the effective material parameters. \r
These bounds will become narrower as the unit cell \r
becomes smaller in comparison with the wavelength. \r
The correct length of a unit cell can be determined \r

(offset for clarity). Note that while the addition of the SRR \r
medium to the wire medium results in a more positive \r
permittivity (solid line) than wires alone (dashed curve), \r
nevertheless there is a frequency region (~8.5-9.0 GHz) \r
where both ε and µ are negative. \r

empirically, by requiring a solution that is stable for \r
several analyzed lengths. \r
As a final point, we note that this analysis depends \r
entirely on our ability to measure structures for which \r
the electric polarization P depends only on the electric \r
field E, and the magnetization M depends only on the \r
magnetic field H. For a general scattering element, this \r
does not necessarily hold, and we may have, for \r
example, a constitutive relation such as \r
H=γE+B/µ [15]. A medium that responds in such a \r
manner will exhibit chirality, and a rotation of the \r
polarization. Indeed, in these calculations we do find \r
some degree of polarization conversion in the data for \r
the SRRs and the combined SRR/wire medium. This \r
evidence of chiral behavior suggests the analysis \r
presented here provides a good, but not exact, \r
characterization of the metamaterial. Further \r
improvements to the technique should allow a full \r
characterization to be implemented. \r

We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix \r
simulations on finite lengths of electromagnetic metamaterials, to determine the effective \r
permittivity (ε) and permeability (µ). We perform this analysis on structures composed of \r
periodic arrangements of wires, split ring resonators (SRRs) and both wires and SRRs. We find \r
the recovered frequency-dependent ε and µ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions \r
predicted by effective medium arguments. Of particular relevance are that a wire medium \r
exhibits a frequency region in which the real part of ε is negative, and SRRs produce a \r
frequency region in which the real part of µ is negative. In the combination structure, at \r
frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ε and µ are simultaneously negative, the real \r
part of the index-of-refraction is found also to be unambiguously negative. \r

It has been proposed that electromagnetic \r
metamaterials—composite structured materials, formed \r
from either periodic or random arrays of scattering \r
elements—should respond to electromagnetic radiation \r
as continuous materials, at least in the long wavelength \r
limit [1,2]. In recent experiments and simulations [3,4], \r
it has been demonstrated that certain metamaterial \r
configurations exhibit scattering behavior consistent \r
with the assumption of approximate frequency\u0002dependent forms for ε and µ. However, the techniques \r
applied in those studies probed the materials indirectly, \r
and did not provide an explicit measurement that would \r
assign values for ε and µ. It is our aim in this paper to \r
show that the previous conjectures were indeed valid: \r
unambiguous values for ε and µ can be applied to \r
electromagnetic metamaterials. Our approach here \r
utilizes the transmission and reflection coefficients (S\u0002parameters, equivalently) calculated for a wave \r
normally incident on a finite slab of metamaterial. We \r
invert the scattering data to determine n and z, for \r
systems of several thicknesses, from which we obtain \r
self-consistent values for ε and µ. While we utilize \r
simulation data in this study, the technique we describe \r
will be readily applicable to the experimental \r
characterization of metamaterial samples whenever the \r
scattering parameters are known. \r
The common method of characterizing the \r
electromagnetic scattering properties of a homogeneous \r
material is to identify its impedance (z) and refractive \r
index (n) [5,6]. While it is possible to completely \r
specify the scattering in terms of z and n, it is often \r
more convenient to choose a second set of analytic \r
variables that carry a direct material interpretation. \r
These variables are the electric permittivity ε=n/z, and \r
the magnetic permeability µ=nz. Both n and z, and \r
therefore ε and µ, are frequency-dependent complex \r
functions that satisfy certain requirements based on \r
causality. For passive materials, Re(z) and Im(n) must \r
be greater than zero. \r
At a given frequency, any material that supports \r
only one propagating mode will generally exhibit a \r
well-defined refractive index n, whether the material is \r
continuous or not. Photonic band gap materials, for \r
example, are characterized by dispersion curves from \r
which an effective index can extracted, even for bands \r
well above the first band gap, and well-defined \r
refraction phenomena can result [7,8,9]. However, it is \r
generally not possible to assign an impedance (z) to a \r
non-continuous material, except in those cases where \r
the wavelength in the material is much larger than the \r
dimensions and spacing of the constituent scattering \r
elements that compose the medium. If z depends \r
strongly on the surface termination, or if z depends on \r
the overall size of the sample, then z is ambiguous, and \r
it is not possible to assign intrinsic values for ε and µ. \r
The transmission coefficient for waves incident \r
normally to the face of a 1-D slab of continuous \r
material (in vacuum) with length d is related to n and z \r

where m is an integer. When d is large, these branches \r
can lie arbitrarily close to one another, making the \r
selection of the correct branch difficult in the case of \r
dispersive materials. For this reason best results are \r
obtained for the smallest possible thickness of sample, \r
as has commonly been known in the analysis of \r
continuous materials. Even with a small sample, more \r
than one thickness must be measured to identify the \r
correct branch(es) of the solution which yields \r
consistently the same values for n. Note that the \r
requirement that Im(n)>0 uniquely identifies the sign of \r
Re(n), which is essential when the material may \r
potentially have regions which are left-handed—that is, \r
materials in which Re(n) may be negative. \r
In order to demonstrate the validity of assigning \r
bulk permeability and permittivity values to non \r
continuous metamaterials, we utilize simulation data \r
generated by the transfer matrix method (TMM) [10,11] \r
on three types of structures: a medium composed of a \r
periodic array of wires, a medium composed of a \r
periodic array of split ring resonators (SRRs), and a \r
medium composed by interleaving the wire and the \r
SRR arrays. We simulate one unit cell of a given \r
system using periodic boundary conditions in the \r
directions perpendicular to the propagation direction. \r
The TMM represents a complete solution of Maxwell’s \r
equations, and differs from Eqs. (1) and (2) in that the \r
exact details of the scattering elements are taken into \r
account. In the embedding medium, all eigenvalues of \r
the TM can be found analytically [12]. We find that in \r
the frequency range of interest and for the incoming \r
wave perpendicular to the sample surface, there is only \r
one propagating mode. All other modes are evanescent, \r
so that the systems considered are effectively one\u0002dimensional and we are justified utilizing Eqs. (5) and \r
(6), in which t’ and r represent the transmission and \r
reflection for this propagating mode. In the calculations \r
presented here, cells were meshed with 15x11x15 grid \r
points, in a manner described in Ref. 11. In the \r
formulation of the TMM used here, the metal dielectric \r
function is approximated by ε=-1000 + 18,000i, for all \r
frequencies. A larger value of the imaginary part of the \r
dielectric function for the metal results in lowered \r
absorption, but does not change the qualitative picture \r
presented here. \r
A square array of conducting wires, based on \r
effective medium arguments, is expected to exhibit the

ideal frequency-dependent plasmonic form of ε=1-\r
ωco2\r
/ω2, where ωco is a cutoff frequency [1]. Fig. 1 \r
shows the permittivity recovered from simulation data \r
for an array of wires, continuous along the E-polarized \r
direction of the incident wave, and with lattice constant \r
5 mm. The figure shows data for one, three, and five \r
layers of lattice in the propagation direction. A fit to the \r
resulting curves indicates a cutoff frequency of \r
ωp/2π=22.3 GHz, consistent with that determined by the \r
noting the onset of transmission (not shown), with a \r
frequency dependence indistinguishable from the three \r
and five row curves. The recovered permeability was \r
found to be unity at all frequencies. \r
While there is no ambiguity in determining the \r
phase of the transmitted wave, the phase of the reflected \r
wave must be measured relative to a reference plane \r
that is considered to be at the first face of the material. \r
Given that metamaterials generally do not have well\u0002defined surfaces, the question arises as to where this \r
reference plane should be located. A definite answer \r
can be obtained in the case of the wire structure, where \r
it is reasonable to assume that the reference plane \r
coincides with the first plane of the wires. We found \r
that with this choice of reference plane, the relation \r
z(ω)=1/n(ω) holds, consistent with the response of the \r
wire medium being entirely electric (i.e., µ=1). For the \r
SRR medium, the choice of reference plane was not \r
found to be critical; for the combined structure, \r
however, the wires dominate the scattering, and the \r
reference plane was again chosen to coincide with the \r
first plane of wires. \r
A second ambiguity that arises is the effective unit cell \r
length that will result in values of ε and µ that do not \r
depend on the overall length of the structure. \r
Empirically, we find in the three cases investigated that \r
the correct length corresponds to the number of unit \r
cells multiplied by the length of each unit cell. This can \r
be seen in Fig. 1, where the analysis of different lengths \r
of the wire medium results in the same permittivity; \r
only for a wire medium consisting of one layer is there \r
a noticeable deviation from the “bulk” behavior. It \r
should be noted that the unit cells analyzed here are \r
square, and thus the unit cell length is implicit in the \r
calculation by virtue of the spacing between elements in \r
the direction perpendicular to propagation. The fact \r
that even one unit cell in the propagation direction \r
produces nearly the same scattering parameters as a \r
thicker material may therefore not be so unexpected. \r
Fig. 2 shows the real and imaginary parts of the \r
permeability for a medium composed of only SRRs, as \r
configured in Ref. [11]. The dark solid curves are taken \r
from the simulation data, while the dashed curves are \r

especially if the elements are resonant. In Fig. 3, we \r
plot the recovered frequency-dependent permittivity \r
corresponding to the SRR medium, which is significant \r
over the frequency range covered. \r
The result of combining a wire medium with an \r
SRR medium is shown in Fig. 4, in which we compare \r
the real parts of the recovered permittivity and \r
permeability from the combined structure with that \r
from either the wire or the SRR medium alone. The \r
solid curves are from the combined structure, while the \r
dashed curves are from either medium alone. \r
Consistent with what is observed in other calculations, \r
as well as experiments, the addition of the wires to the \r
SRR medium does not impact the permeability \r
properties of the SRR medium. However, the \r
combination of the SRRs and wires results in a \r
permittivity that is less negative than that for wires \r
alone. \r
It was first theoretically suggested by Veselago \r
[13] that an incoming wave incident on an interface \r
between vacuum and material with simultaneously \r
negative Re(ε) and Re(µ) would be refracted to the \r
same side of the normal to the interface. By \r
considering the analytic properties of the refractive \r
index in such a medium, it was shown that the refractive \r
index n must, in fact, be negative wherever ε and µ are \r
both negative [14]. In a recent experiment [4], a \r
metamaterial formed by combining a wire medium with \r
a SRR medium, qualitatively similar to those simulated \r
here, was used to demonstrate negative refraction, and \r
the angle of refraction was utilized to recover n as a \r
function of frequency. While a refraction experiment is \r
a useful method to measure the index, we can also \r
obtain this information directly and unambiguously \r
using Eq. 3, as shown in Fig. 5. If one has access to \r
phase information in the transmission and reflection \r
coefficients, one can identify both the magnitude and \r
sign of the refractive index from direct incidence \r
measurements on a planar slab. \r
We have demonstrated that the traditional \r
procedure of obtaining material parameters from \r
transmission/reflection data can be successfully applied \r
to metamaterials, subject to the possible ambiguities of \r
the definition of the first surface of the measured \r
sample, and the sample length. The former ambiguity \r
can be resolved in certain cases by using additional \r
information about the material, as shown in the case for \r
the wire medium above. In cases for which it is not \r
possible to determine the correct position of the \r
scattering surface, the range of possible solutions \r
corresponding to the various possible surfaces \r
throughout the unit cell will place bounds on the \r
possible values of the effective material parameters. \r
These bounds will become narrower as the unit cell \r
becomes smaller in comparison with the wavelength. \r
The correct length of a unit cell can be determined \r

(bottom, solid curve, right-hand scale) as a function of \r
frequency for the combination SRR/wire medium. The flat \r
dashed lines indicate the zero values for the two axes \r
(offset for clarity). Note that while the addition of the SRR \r
medium to the wire medium results in a more positive \r
permittivity (solid line) than wires alone (dashed curve), \r
nevertheless there is a frequency region (~8.5-9.0 GHz) \r
where both ε and µ are negative. \r

empirically, by requiring a solution that is stable for \r
several analyzed lengths. \r
As a final point, we note that this analysis depends \r
entirely on our ability to measure structures for which \r
the electric polarization P depends only on the electric \r
field E, and the magnetization M depends only on the \r
magnetic field H. For a general scattering element, this \r
does not necessarily hold, and we may have, for \r
example, a constitutive relation such as \r
H=γE+B/µ [15]. A medium that responds in such a \r
manner will exhibit chirality, and a rotation of the \r
polarization. Indeed, in these calculations we do find \r
some degree of polarization conversion in the data for \r
the SRRs and the combined SRR/wire medium. This \r
evidence of chiral behavior suggests the analysis \r
presented here provides a good, but not exact, \r
characterization of the metamaterial. Further \r
improvements to the technique should allow a full \r
characterization to be implemented. \r
