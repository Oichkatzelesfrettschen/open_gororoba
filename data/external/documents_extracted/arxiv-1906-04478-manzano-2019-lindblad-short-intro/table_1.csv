being ai ∈ R the eigenvalues of the observable and,aii their corresponding eigenvectors. The probability of obtaining
the result ai when measuring the property described by observable O in a state,ψi is given by
P(ai) =,hψ,aii,2. (5)
After the measurement we obtain the state,aii if the outcome ai was measured. This is called the post-measurement
