Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known predic\u0002tion of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more\r
recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While\r
previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton\r
amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third\r
one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016\r
for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tad\u0002pole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton\r
amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all\r
three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the\r
case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the\r
electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show\r
that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to\r
the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.\r

1 Introduction\r
Although processes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are presently not of direct experimental\r
relevance, they are of great theoretical interest, and much effort has gone into their study\r
both at the tree-level [1–6] and the one-loop level [7–11].\r
A particularly well-studied process is photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field.\r
Einstein-Maxwell theory contains a tree-level vertex involving two photons and one graviton,\r

An important application of this amplitude is the conversion of electromagnetic waves\r
into gravitational waves (and vice-versa) in an external magnetic field, as pointed out by\r
Gertsenshtein as early as 1962 [12]. At the tree level, these processes and the associated\r
photon-graviton conversion have since been studied by many authors [13–20]. However, it\r
is only in 2005 that two of the present authors [21] calculated the one-loop correction to\r
the amplitude (1.1) due to the diagram shown in Fig. 2 on the left, with either a scalar or\r
spinor loop.\r

the scalar and spinor loop cases. Those representations are of the same type as the ones\r
that one finds for the better-known one-loop photon vacuum polarisation in a constant field,\r
computed either in the worldline formalism [32, 33] or the Feynman diagram approach (see\r
[34–36] and refs. therein).\r
Although numerically these one-loop corrections for realistic field strengths are small\r
(suppressed by a factor of α) compared to the tree-level ones, in the subsequent study [37]\r
an important qualitative difference emerged: while the tree-level photon-graviton conver\u0002sion amplitude in the field gives (contrary to the superficially similar case of photon-axion\r
conversion [14, 38–43]) equal conversion rates for both photon polarisations, at the one-loop\r
level this rate starts becoming polarisation-dependent. This leads to dichroism, and further\r
analysis by Ahlers et al. [44], who undertook an exhaustive search for other sources of\r
magnetic dichroism showed that, although magnetic photon-graviton conversion is a very\r
small effect under realistic conditions, remarkably it is still the leading such effect in the\r
whole Standard Model. Their analysis of magnetic dichroism was also more complete in\r
taking the right-hand diagram of Fig. 2 into account, which contributes to it at the same\r
order in α.\r
Even so, from their numbers it is clear that this effect will hardly be accessible to\r
experiment in the near future, a conclusion that is consistent with recent detailed feasibility\r
and sensitivity studies of light-induced gravitational effects using interferometric techniques\r
[45, 46]. Nevertheless, this is of course presently the case for all process involving gravitons,\r
and in the long run we would still consider magnetic dichroism due to photon-graviton\r
conversion as a leading contender in the quest for an eventual experimental demonstration\r
of the existence of the graviton. This is because (i) it involves only a single gravitational\r
coupling (ii) it does not require a direct measurement of the graviton itself and (iii) dichroism\r
can be measured with high precision using optical cavities [47–53].\r
The main purpose of the present paper is to point out the existence of yet another dia\u0002gram contributing to electromagnetic photon-graviton conversion at the same order, shown\r
in the middle of Fig. 2, or more precisely its non-vanishing. This requires some explanation.\r
Prior to 2017 it had generally been assumed, and even stated in QED textbooks (see, e.g.,\r
[34, 54]) that the one-photon tadpole diagram in a constant electromagnetic field Fig. 4\r
vanishes, and therefore also any diagram containing it.\r
The argument goes as follows:\r
1. A constant field emits only photons with zero energy-momentum, thus there is a factor\r
of δ(k).\r

2. Because of gauge invariance, this diagram in a momentum expansion starts with the\r
term linear in momentum.\r
3. δ(k)k\r
µ = 0.\r
Since the tadpole thus formally vanishes, it has been assumed for decades that also any\r
diagram containing it can be discarded, for example, the “handcuff” contribution Fig. 5 to\r
the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian [34, 35].\r

he existence as a matter of principle of the 1PR term in Eq. (30) has been known for a\r
time. It has, however, been argued that this term vanishes for constant external fields\r
4]. Let us reproduce this argument for reasons of completeness: a crucial building block\r

1-loop[A¯] is a Lorentz 4-vector. The vector\r

onstant fields ∂µFνκ = 0 and for an x independent current, all conceivable combinations\r
one vector index vanish and so does the current (an explicit verification of this fact in\r
entum space is given below).\r
While this part of the argument holds true in the full analysis, it does not necessarily\r

Eq. (2) follows straightforwardly from Eq. (4).\r
Prior to the recent analysis performed in Ref. [1], this contribution was believed to vanish\r
in constant fields [7, 9], based on the argument that (2π)dδ(d)(k) kα = 0 in Eq. (5), thereby\r
missing the subtlety that, upon convolution with the infrared divergent photon propagator,\r
the current (5) might induce finite 1PR tadpole contributions in Feynman diagrams. Finally,\r
note that L2-loop\r
HE may alternatively be viewed as a one-loop calculation performed with the\r
charged particle propagator in the constant field already accounting for quantum corrections\r
at one-loop level. The latter is depicted in Fig. 2. Identifying the in- and outgoing charged\r

particle lines in Fig. 2 to form loops, the diagrams shown in Fig. 1 are recovered.\r
B. Charged particle propagators in constant electromagnetic fields\r
Meanwhile, Refs. [5, 6] have explicitly determined the one-loop tadpole corrections for\r
the propagators of both charged scalar and spinor particles in constant fields within the\r
worldline formalism. The respective Feynman diagram is depicted in Fig. 2 (right). Their\r
finding is that in momentum space this 1PR contribution to the charged particle propagator\r
can be expressed similarly to Eq. (2) as\r
Figure 6. Full scalar or spinor propagator in a constant field.\r
Similarly, [59, 60] found that the one-loop tadpole contribution to the scalar or spinor\r
propagator in a constant field (Fig.6) is also non-vanishing, and given by\r

where S(p) denotes the tree-level propagator in the field, see also [61].\r
Below we perform the similar, albeit more complicated, calculation of the middle dia\u0002gram of Fig. 2. Moreover, we provide a unified calculation of all three diagrams using the\r
worldline formalism, and show that, although the tadpole diagram contributes to the am\u0002plitude, it leaves the magnetic dichroism unchanged. Although our main interest is in the\r
magnetic field and spinor loop case, we will perform all calculations in a general constant\r
field and for both the scalar and spinor loop, since in the worldline formalism this essen\u0002tially does not imply any extra computational effort. All formulas required to specialize the\r
field to a purely magnetic one (as well as a purely electric or crossed-field one) are given in\r
appendix B.\r
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the worldline\r
representation of the one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes with a scalar or spinor loop in\r
vacuum, including a short discussion of the gauge and gravitational Ward identities. In\r
section 3 we show how to incorporate an external constant electromagnetic field. Section 4\r
summarizes the worldline calculation of [21, 37] of the “main” or “irreducible” contributions\r
Γ\r
(irr) to these amplitudes, while section 6 analyzes the contribution Γ(ext). The central\r
section is 5 where we derive the new “tadpole” contributions Γ\r
(tadpole). In section 7 we\r
study the weak-field expansion of the tadpole contribution in a magnetic field. In section\r
8 we verify the gravitational Ward identities for these amplitudes, which also provides a\r
non-trivial check. Section 9 offers our conclusions. Appendix A establishes our conventions\r
for Einstein-Maxwell theory, while in appendix B we collect some useful formulas involving\r
the worldline Green’s functions and determinants in a constant field.\r
Partial results of this work were presented in [62].\r
2 One-loop amplitudes with one graviton and N photons\r
We shortly summarize the worldline approach to the calculation of the one-loop amplitudes\r
involving a scalar or spinor in the loop and one graviton and N photons, first in vacuum\r
[28–31, 63, 64]. These amplitudes have an irreducible contribution, where all the external\r
legs are directly attached to the loop, and a reducible one, where the graviton is attached\r
to one of the photons.\r

2.2 Reducible contribution\r
The reducible contribution to the N-photon/one graviton amplitude, where the graviton is\r
attached to one of the photons, usually would be constructed by sewing together the N\u0002photon amplitude and the photon-photon-graviton vertex of Fig. 1. For the analogous case\r
of the scalar tree-level propagator dressed with N photons and one graviton, D\r
(red)pp′\r
N,1\r
, it was\r
shown in [64] that the effect of this sewing can be expressed by the following replacement\r

Here we observe that the same replacement rule applies as well for the one-loop N-photon/one\r
graviton amplitudes with either a scalar or a spinor loop. For the scalar loop this is obvious\r
from the fact that our derivation of that rule in [64] did not make use at all of the boundary\r
conditions imposed on the scalar path integral. But neither did we use the specific form\r
of the scalar vertex operator, and the reader can easily convince herself that changing the\r
scalar vertex operator into a spinor one will not make a difference here. Thus, without\r
further ado, we can write down the reducible part of the spinor/scalar loop contribution to\r
the one-graviton N-photon amplitude as\r

3 Inclusion of a constant electromagnetic field\r
3.1 General procedure\r
The generalisation of the formalism to the case of the photon-graviton amplitudes in a\r
constant electromagnetic field is straightforward and proceeds essentially as in the purely\r
electromagnetic case [24, 26, 27, 33, 68–70]: the master formulas (2.1) acquire an additional\r

Since these Green’s functions have a non-trivial Lorentz structure, the Wick-contraction\r
rules (2.6), (2.7) generalise in the form\r
⟨x\r

The rule (2.14) for the construction of the reducible contributions, where the graviton\r
gets attached to one of the photons, is also not affected by the presence of the external\r
field.\r
At the one-graviton level, the only really new aspect arising from the presence of the\r
external field is that there is now a second type of reducible contributions, since the graviton\r
can now be attached also to one of the photons emitted by the external field, see Fig. 7.\r

Next we would like to use the fact that the integrand contains terms which integrate to zero\r

worldline Green’s function as\r
GB12 = SB12 + AB12 , (3.15)\r
where SBij denotes the even (SBii ≡ SB) and ABij the odd part (ABii ≡ AB) as a power\r

given number of interactions with the field. It is then immediately seen that this amplitude\r
is nonzero only if this number of interactions is odd, since otherwise the τ1,2 integrations\r
vanish by antisymmetry.\r
The leading term in this expansion in the background field is UV divergent. In dimen\u0002sional regularisation, this divergence is [21]\r

However, note that, unlike the renormalization which we performed on the irreducible\r
contribution Γ\r
(irr)\r
spin, this one is nothing new; the contribution of the tadpole linear in the field\r
corresponds to the diagram shown in Fig. 8, which makes it clear that this subtraction is just\r
a special case (the zero-momentum limit) of the QED photon wave function renormalization,\r

6 Third contribution to electromagnetic photon-graviton conversion\r
For the other reducible contribution, corresponding to the third diagram in Fig. 2, we\r
can use eqs. (3.7), (3.8), with k\r
′ = k0 = −k, and our results for the vacuum polarization\r
tensor in a constant field from subsection 3.3. Like the tadpole contribution, it has a UV\r
divergence from the field-independent part of the vacuum polarization tensor. This part\r
corresponds to the right-hand diagram of Fig. 2, but with the loop fermion taken in vacuum,\r
and according to the LSZ formalism is not to be taken into account in the calculation of the\r
– 15 –

on-shell amplitude. Using our result (3.23) for the on-shell renormalized one-loop vacuum\r
polarization tensor in the constant field, and putting things together, we have\r

spin as given in (3.20). Note that this contribution, too, after renormalization starts\r
with terms cubic in F, and that on-shell it has an IR divergence through the pole in (6.2).\r
A proper treatment of the on-shell limit requires a somewhat different interpretation of\r
the third diagram, namely as a correction to the tree-level amplitude due to the modified\r
dispersion relation of the photon in the field [44]. In the presence of an external field, the\r
physical photon eigenmodes no longer satisfy the vacuum on-shell condition k\r
2 = 0; instead,\r
their propagation is governed by the dispersion relation k\r
2 + Π(k) = 0, where Π denotes\r
the photon polarization tensor, leading in general to a field induced deviation from k\r
2 = 0.\r
The corresponding amplitude for a scalar loop is simply obtained by replacing Π¯ βα\r
spin(k; F)\r
with Π¯ βα\r
scal(k; F) in (6.1).\r
7 Weak-field expansion of the tadpole contribution\r
Since phenomenological applications are primarily concerned with the regime of weak ex\u0002ternal fields, we briefly discuss the tadpole contribution in the limit of a weak magnetic\r
background,\r
eB ≪ m2. (6.1)\r
In this regime, the proper-time integrals admit a systematic asymptotic expansion in powers\r
of the dimensionless ratio eB/m2.\r
For definiteness, we present the weak-field expansion only for the spinor loop, since the\r
scalar case follows by an entirely analogous procedure. To derive this expansion, it is con\u0002venient to return to the proper-time representation of the spinor tadpole contribution given\r
in Eq. (5.6), prior to performing the z-integration. Specializing to D = 4, the hyperbolic\r
functions appearing in the integrand can be expanded for small\r
z = eBT , (6.2)\r
which is justified since the proper-time integral is exponentially dominated by values T ∼\r
1/m2in the weak-field regime.\r

8 Ward identities for the photon-graviton amplitude in a constant field\r
Finally, let us discuss how the Ward identities work for the photon-graviton amplitude in\r
a constant field, returning to the off-shell unrenormalized amplitudes. Here there is no\r
difference between the scalar and spinor-loop cases. It is easy to see that the gauge Ward\r
identity holds for each of the three contributions separately, i.e.\r

(irr),(tadpole),(ext)(−k, ϵ0; k, δε; F) = 0 , (7.1)\r

9 Conclusions\r
In this work we have re-examined electromagnetic photon–graviton conversion in a con\u0002stant external field within Einstein–Maxwell theory at the one-loop level. Although pho\u0002ton–graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field might eventually find applications in a\r
broader range of physical contexts, here we have focused on its dichroism aspect, motivated\r
by the analysis of Ref. [44], which demonstrated that this process provides the leading\r
Standard Model contribution to magnetic dichroism, despite its small absolute magnitude\r
under realistic conditions.\r
Our main result is the identification and explicit evaluation of a non-vanishing tadpole\r
contribution to the one-loop photon–graviton conversion amplitude, corresponding to the\r
middle diagram in Fig. 2. Contrary to long-standing assumptions, this diagram does not\r
vanish once the infrared behavior of the connecting photon propagator is treated correctly\r
in dimensional regularization. Using the worldline formalism, we have provided a unified\r
calculation of all one-loop contributions — irreducible, tadpole, and other reducible — for\r
scalar and spinor loops in a general constant electromagnetic background.\r
Although the tadpole diagram contributes to the full one-loop amplitude, it is irrelevant\r
for magnetic dichroism already at a structural level. From (5.6) we see that the magnetic\r
tadpole contribution depends on the photon and graviton polarizations through a global\r
factor tr(F ϵ0f), which (for on-shell gravitons) is proportional to the tree-level amplitude\r
Γ\r
(tree)(k0, ϵ0; k, ε; F) of eq. (1.1), implying identical photon–graviton conversion rates for\r
the two photon polarizations. Consequently, the magnetic dichroism remains unchanged,\r
and the analysis of Ahlers et al. [44] is not affected by the presence of the tadpole diagram.\r
In the weak-field regime eB/m2 ≪ 1, relevant for phenomenological applications, the\r
tadpole contribution is moreover parametrically suppressed compared to the irreducible\r
one-loop contribution. In the strong-field limit eB/m2 ≫ 1, the relative importance of dif\u0002ferent one-loop contributions can change qualitatively, as has been demonstrated in related\r
contexts [71]. In such regimes, tadpole-type contributions may play a more prominent role\r
in the overall amplitude, which could be relevant not only from a theoretical standpoint but\r
also in extensions of the Standard Model involving light or weakly charged particles, such\r
as mini-charged particles [72], for which strong-field effects can become physically relevant.\r
Independently of these phenomenological considerations, the inclusion of the tadpole di\u0002agram is conceptually important. It completes the one-loop description of photon–graviton\r
conversion in external fields and clarifies its close connection to other one-particle reducible\r

effects in background-field QED. Our results thus provide a consistent and complete frame\u0002work for future studies, including strong-field backgrounds, non-standard charged sectors,\r
and higher-loop corrections.\r

For the purpose of simplifying integrals, it will often be convenient to decompose the\r
constant-field worldline Green’s functions as\r
GB12 = SB12 + AB12 (B.12)\r
where SB denotes the even and AB the odd part as a power series in F. Note that SB is\r
symmetric as a Lorentz matrix and AB antisymmetric, which motivates our notation.\r
Special constant fields:\r

• Parallel electric and magnetic fields:\r
in the generic case, it is possible to find a Lorentz system where E and B both point\r
along the z - axis. If we further assume, for definiteness, that E · B > 0, then we can\r
take them both to point along the positive z-axis, E = (0, 0, E), B = (0, 0, B). The\r
euclidean field strength tensor then takes the form\r

Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known predic\u0002tion of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more\r
recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While\r
previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton\r
amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third\r
one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016\r
for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tad\u0002pole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton\r
amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all\r
three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the\r
case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the\r
electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show\r
that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to\r
the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.\r

Although processes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are presently not of direct experimental\r
relevance, they are of great theoretical interest, and much effort has gone into their study\r

A particularly well-studied process is photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field.\r

An important application of this amplitude is the conversion of electromagnetic waves\r
into gravitational waves (and vice-versa) in an external magnetic field, as pointed out by\r
Gertsenshtein as early as 1962 [12]. At the tree level, these processes and the associated\r
photon-graviton conversion have since been studied by many authors [13–20]. However, it\r
is only in 2005 that two of the present authors [21] calculated the one-loop correction to\r
the amplitude (1.1) due to the diagram shown in Fig. 2 on the left, with either a scalar or\r

the scalar and spinor loop cases. Those representations are of the same type as the ones\r
that one finds for the better-known one-loop photon vacuum polarisation in a constant field,\r
computed either in the worldline formalism [32, 33] or the Feynman diagram approach (see\r
[34–36] and refs. therein).\r
Although numerically these one-loop corrections for realistic field strengths are small\r
(suppressed by a factor of α) compared to the tree-level ones, in the subsequent study [37]\r
an important qualitative difference emerged: while the tree-level photon-graviton conver\u0002sion amplitude in the field gives (contrary to the superficially similar case of photon-axion\r
conversion [14, 38–43]) equal conversion rates for both photon polarisations, at the one-loop\r
level this rate starts becoming polarisation-dependent. This leads to dichroism, and further\r
analysis by Ahlers et al. [44], who undertook an exhaustive search for other sources of\r
magnetic dichroism showed that, although magnetic photon-graviton conversion is a very\r
small effect under realistic conditions, remarkably it is still the leading such effect in the\r
whole Standard Model. Their analysis of magnetic dichroism was also more complete in\r
taking the right-hand diagram of Fig. 2 into account, which contributes to it at the same\r
order in α.\r
Even so, from their numbers it is clear that this effect will hardly be accessible to\r
experiment in the near future, a conclusion that is consistent with recent detailed feasibility\r
and sensitivity studies of light-induced gravitational effects using interferometric techniques\r
[45, 46]. Nevertheless, this is of course presently the case for all process involving gravitons,\r
and in the long run we would still consider magnetic dichroism due to photon-graviton\r
conversion as a leading contender in the quest for an eventual experimental demonstration\r
of the existence of the graviton. This is because (i) it involves only a single gravitational\r
coupling (ii) it does not require a direct measurement of the graviton itself and (iii) dichroism\r
can be measured with high precision using optical cavities [47–53].\r
The main purpose of the present paper is to point out the existence of yet another dia\u0002gram contributing to electromagnetic photon-graviton conversion at the same order, shown\r
in the middle of Fig. 2, or more precisely its non-vanishing. This requires some explanation.\r
Prior to 2017 it had generally been assumed, and even stated in QED textbooks (see, e.g.,\r
[34, 54]) that the one-photon tadpole diagram in a constant electromagnetic field Fig. 4\r
vanishes, and therefore also any diagram containing it.\r
The argument goes as follows:\r
1. A constant field emits only photons with zero energy-momentum, thus there is a factor\r
of δ(k).\r
– 3 –

Figure 4. One-photon amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field.\r
2. Because of gauge invariance, this diagram in a momentum expansion starts with the\r
term linear in momentum.\r
3. δ(k)k\r
µ = 0.\r
Since the tadpole thus formally vanishes, it has been assumed for decades that also any\r
diagram containing it can be discarded, for example, the “handcuff” contribution Fig. 5 to\r
the two-loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian [34, 35].\r

he existence as a matter of principle of the 1PR term in Eq. (30) has been known for a\r

onstant fields ∂µFνκ = 0 and for an x independent current, all conceivable combinations\r
one vector index vanish and so does the current (an explicit verification of this fact in\r

While this part of the argument holds true in the full analysis, it does not necessarily\r

Eq. (2) follows straightforwardly from Eq. (4).\r
Prior to the recent analysis performed in Ref. [1], this contribution was believed to vanish\r
in constant fields [7, 9], based on the argument that (2π)dδ(d)(k) kα = 0 in Eq. (5), thereby\r
missing the subtlety that, upon convolution with the infrared divergent photon propagator,\r
the current (5) might induce finite 1PR tadpole contributions in Feynman diagrams. Finally,\r
note that L2-loop\r
HE may alternatively be viewed as a one-loop calculation performed with the\r
charged particle propagator in the constant field already accounting for quantum corrections\r
at one-loop level. The latter is depicted in Fig. 2. Identifying the in- and outgoing charged\r

field.\r
particle lines in Fig. 2 to form loops, the diagrams shown in Fig. 1 are recovered.\r
B. Charged particle propagators in constant electromagnetic fields\r
Meanwhile, Refs. [5, 6] have explicitly determined the one-loop tadpole corrections for\r
the propagators of both charged scalar and spinor particles in constant fields within the\r
worldline formalism. The respective Feynman diagram is depicted in Fig. 2 (right). Their\r
finding is that in momentum space this 1PR contribution to the charged particle propagator\r
can be expressed similarly to Eq. (2) as\r
Figure 6. Full scalar or spinor propagator in a constant field.\r
Similarly, [59, 60] found that the one-loop tadpole contribution to the scalar or spinor\r
propagator in a constant field (Fig.6) is also non-vanishing, and given by\r

where S(p) denotes the tree-level propagator in the field, see also [61].\r
Below we perform the similar, albeit more complicated, calculation of the middle dia\u0002gram of Fig. 2. Moreover, we provide a unified calculation of all three diagrams using the\r
worldline formalism, and show that, although the tadpole diagram contributes to the am\u0002plitude, it leaves the magnetic dichroism unchanged. Although our main interest is in the\r
magnetic field and spinor loop case, we will perform all calculations in a general constant\r
field and for both the scalar and spinor loop, since in the worldline formalism this essen\u0002tially does not imply any extra computational effort. All formulas required to specialize the\r
field to a purely magnetic one (as well as a purely electric or crossed-field one) are given in\r
appendix B.\r
The organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review the worldline\r
representation of the one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes with a scalar or spinor loop in\r
vacuum, including a short discussion of the gauge and gravitational Ward identities. In\r
section 3 we show how to incorporate an external constant electromagnetic field. Section 4\r
summarizes the worldline calculation of [21, 37] of the “main” or “irreducible” contributions\r
Γ\r
(irr) to these amplitudes, while section 6 analyzes the contribution Γ(ext). The central\r
section is 5 where we derive the new “tadpole” contributions Γ\r
(tadpole). In section 7 we\r
study the weak-field expansion of the tadpole contribution in a magnetic field. In section\r
8 we verify the gravitational Ward identities for these amplitudes, which also provides a\r
non-trivial check. Section 9 offers our conclusions. Appendix A establishes our conventions\r
for Einstein-Maxwell theory, while in appendix B we collect some useful formulas involving\r
the worldline Green’s functions and determinants in a constant field.\r

The reducible contribution to the N-photon/one graviton amplitude, where the graviton is\r

graviton amplitudes with either a scalar or a spinor loop. For the scalar loop this is obvious\r
from the fact that our derivation of that rule in [64] did not make use at all of the boundary\r
conditions imposed on the scalar path integral. But neither did we use the specific form\r
of the scalar vertex operator, and the reader can easily convince herself that changing the\r
scalar vertex operator into a spinor one will not make a difference here. Thus, without\r

structure of this amplitude. Although our calculation is nonperturbative in the external\r
field, we can use the series expansions of GB, G˙B, G¨B and GF , G˙\r
F in the field, whose first few\r
terms are given in (B.9) - (B.11) and (B.40), (B.41), to compute the amplitude involving a\r
given number of interactions with the field. It is then immediately seen that this amplitude\r
is nonzero only if this number of interactions is odd, since otherwise the τ1,2 integrations\r
vanish by antisymmetry.\r
The leading term in this expansion in the background field is UV divergent. In dimen\u0002sional regularisation, this divergence is [21]\r

In this work we have re-examined electromagnetic photon–graviton conversion in a con\u0002stant external field within Einstein–Maxwell theory at the one-loop level. Although pho\u0002ton–graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field might eventually find applications in a\r
broader range of physical contexts, here we have focused on its dichroism aspect, motivated\r
by the analysis of Ref. [44], which demonstrated that this process provides the leading\r
Standard Model contribution to magnetic dichroism, despite its small absolute magnitude\r
under realistic conditions.\r
Our main result is the identification and explicit evaluation of a non-vanishing tadpole\r
contribution to the one-loop photon–graviton conversion amplitude, corresponding to the\r
middle diagram in Fig. 2. Contrary to long-standing assumptions, this diagram does not\r
vanish once the infrared behavior of the connecting photon propagator is treated correctly\r
in dimensional regularization. Using the worldline formalism, we have provided a unified\r
calculation of all one-loop contributions — irreducible, tadpole, and other reducible — for\r
scalar and spinor loops in a general constant electromagnetic background.\r
Although the tadpole diagram contributes to the full one-loop amplitude, it is irrelevant\r
for magnetic dichroism already at a structural level. From (5.6) we see that the magnetic\r
tadpole contribution depends on the photon and graviton polarizations through a global\r
factor tr(F ϵ0f), which (for on-shell gravitons) is proportional to the tree-level amplitude\r
Γ\r
(tree)(k0, ϵ0; k, ε; F) of eq. (1.1), implying identical photon–graviton conversion rates for\r
the two photon polarizations. Consequently, the magnetic dichroism remains unchanged,\r
and the analysis of Ahlers et al. [44] is not affected by the presence of the tadpole diagram.\r
In the weak-field regime eB/m2 ≪ 1, relevant for phenomenological applications, the\r
tadpole contribution is moreover parametrically suppressed compared to the irreducible\r
one-loop contribution. In the strong-field limit eB/m2 ≫ 1, the relative importance of dif\u0002ferent one-loop contributions can change qualitatively, as has been demonstrated in related\r
contexts [71]. In such regimes, tadpole-type contributions may play a more prominent role\r
in the overall amplitude, which could be relevant not only from a theoretical standpoint but\r
also in extensions of the Standard Model involving light or weakly charged particles, such\r
as mini-charged particles [72], for which strong-field effects can become physically relevant.\r
Independently of these phenomenological considerations, the inclusion of the tadpole di\u0002agram is conceptually important. It completes the one-loop description of photon–graviton\r
conversion in external fields and clarifies its close connection to other one-particle reducible\r

effects in background-field QED. Our results thus provide a consistent and complete frame\u0002work for future studies, including strong-field backgrounds, non-standard charged sectors,\r
and higher-loop corrections.\r

For the purpose of simplifying integrals, it will often be convenient to decompose the\r
constant-field worldline Green’s functions as\r
GB12 = SB12 + AB12 (B.12)\r
where SB denotes the even and AB the odd part as a power series in F. Note that SB is\r
symmetric as a Lorentz matrix and AB antisymmetric, which motivates our notation.\r
Special constant fields:\r

• Parallel electric and magnetic fields:\r
in the generic case, it is possible to find a Lorentz system where E and B both point\r
along the z - axis. If we further assume, for definiteness, that E · B > 0, then we can\r
take them both to point along the positive z-axis, E = (0, 0, E), B = (0, 0, B). The\r
euclidean field strength tensor then takes the form\r

In a “crossed field”, defined by E ⊥ B, E = B, both invariants B2 − E2 and E · B\r
vanish. For such a field F\r
