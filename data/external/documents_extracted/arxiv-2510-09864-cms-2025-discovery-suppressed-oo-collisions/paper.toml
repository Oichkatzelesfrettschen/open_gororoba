Discovery of suppressed charged-particle production in\r
ultrarelativistic oxygen-oxygen collisions\r
The CMS Collaboration*\r
Abstract\r
A hot and dense state of nuclear matter, known as the quark-gluon plasma, is cre\u0002ated in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei. Highly energetic quarks and glu\u0002ons, collectively referred to as partons, lose energy as they travel through this matter,\r
leading to suppressed production of particles with large transverse momenta (pT).\r
Conversely, high-pT particle suppression has not been seen in proton-lead collisions,\r
raising questions regarding the minimum system size required to observe parton en\u0002ergy loss. Oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions examine a region of effective system size\r
that lies between these two extreme cases. The CMS detector at the CERN LHC has\r
been used to quantify charged-particle production in inclusive OO collisions for the\r
first time via measurements of the nuclear modification factor (RAA). The RAA is de\u0002rived by comparing particle production to expectations based on proton-proton (pp)\r
data and has a value of unity in the absence of nuclear effects. The data for OO and\r
pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy √\r
s\r
NN\r
= 5.36 TeV correspond\r
to integrated luminosities of 6.1 nb−1and 1.02 pb−1, respectively. The RAA is below\r
unity with a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. The data exhibit better\r
agreement with theoretical models incorporating parton energy loss as compared to\r
baseline models without energy loss.\r

In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, a medium consisting of a hot and dense state of nu\u0002clear matter with deconfined quarks and gluons, known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is\r
created [1, 2]. The QGP exhibits many striking properties, including fluid-like collective behav\u0002ior as well as mass- and flavor-dependent modification of particle production when compared\r
to expectations based on proton-proton (pp) data [3–8]. Understanding the dynamics of these\r
phenomena and how they emerge from the underlying theory of the strong force, quantum\r
chromodynamics (QCD) [9, 10], is a key goal of modern high-energy nuclear physics.\r
The microscopic structure of the QGP at short length scales, where individual quark and gluon\r
degrees of freedom are most salient, is experimentally accessible through the examination of\r
high-momentum scattering processes that can happen concurrently with QGP production [11].\r
The scattered quarks and gluons, collectively known as partons, can interact with the QGP\r
and lose energy via collisional and radiative processes [12]. This parton energy loss causes “jet\r
quenching”, a term used to describe the resulting modification of yields, energies, and spatial\r
distributions of particles originating from the initial scattered parton [13].\r
In hadron collider experiments, particles having transverse momentum (pT) greater than a few\r
GeV are almost entirely produced via the fragmentation and hadronization of high-energy par\u0002tons. Thus, high-pT particle spectra are sensitive to parton energy loss effects. Modifications of\r
these spectra are typically quantified using a ratio between the spectra of interest and a baseline\r
found using pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair (√\r
s\r
NN\r
). Specif\u0002ically, the relevant pp spectrum is scaled to account for the larger number of nucleon-nucleon\r
interactions in a nucleus-nucleus collision. Early measurements of this ratio, known as the nu\u0002clear modification factor (RAA), at the CERN SPS [14, 15], the BNL RHIC [5–8], and the CERN\r
LHC [16–18] were among the first indications of jet quenching at their respective collision en\u0002ergy scales. More recent charged-particle RAA measurements at the LHC using lead (208Pb)\r
collisions at √s\r
NN\r
= 5.02 TeV [19–21] and xenon (129Xe) collisions at 5.44 TeV [21–23] found\r
RAA to be in the range of 0.2–0.3 for particles with pT around 8 GeV, indicating significant jet\r
quenching effects in collisions of heavy nuclei.\r
In small collision systems, e.g., pp and pPb, observations of QGP-like effects including col\u0002lectivity [24] and the enhanced production of strange hadrons [25, 26], have prompted ques\u0002tions of whether a small droplet of QGP can be produced in such collisions [27]. However, jet\r
quenching has not been observed in these systems [28–31], and the pPb RAA is close to unity at\r
particle pT > 2 GeV [19, 21, 32]. The absence of a jet quenching signal could be attributable to\r
a lack of QGP production, or alternatively, the very short path length a parton would have to\r
traverse to exit a QGP droplet. It has been proposed to experimentally test the latter hypoth\u0002esis using collisions of light nuclei having low nuclear mass number (A). Such collisions will\r
potentially create a QGP volume in between those of pPb and heavier ion collisions [33]. These\r
intermediate systems are also less sensitive to initial-state energy density fluctuations that hin\u0002der theoretical descriptions of smaller systems [34, 35]. Theoretical models incorporating jet\r
quenching have predicted charged-particle RAA suppression that should be experimentally ac\u0002cessible, of the order of 25% for A = 16 at LHC energies [33, 36–38].\r
In 2025, the LHC delivered TeV-scale collisions of 16O nuclei for the first time. This Letter\r
presents the first measurement of the pT-differential cross section of charged-particle produc\u0002tion in oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions at √\r
s\r
NN\r
= 5.36 TeV using data collected by the CMS\r
experiment. A reference spectrum measured using pp data from 2024 at the same collision en\u0002ergy is also reported. The charged-particle RAA for inclusive OO collisions is then constructed

using the following definition:\r

dpT\r
\u0013\u0015 , (1)\r
where σ\r
AA (σpp) is the cross section for charged-particle production in nucleus-nucleus (pp)\r
collisions. Notably, because the prefactor accounting for the number of nucleons in 16O is\r
exact, this formulation does not contain any model-dependent uncertainties, e.g., from Glauber\r
modeling [39, 40]. The OO data are compared to other collision systems at similar √\r
s\r
NN\r
, as well\r
as predictions from theoretical models. Tabulated results are provided in the HEPData record\r
for this analysis [41].\r
A description of the CMS detector and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations used to evaluate\r
its performance can be found in Appendix A.1. The pp data were collected using a trigger\r
that only required two coincident colliding bunches in the detector, while the OO data were\r
collected using a trigger that searched for one or more energy deposits of at least 7 GeV in\r
either of the forward hadron (HF) calorimeters. The total integrated luminosity utilized was\r
1.02 ± 0.03 pb−1for the pp sample and 6.1 ± 0.2 nb−1for the OO sample. These values are\r
determined by combining two independent measurements. The first is a preliminary analysis\r
of van der Meer scan [42, 43] data. A second luminosity determination was conducted using a\r
method that compares observed Z boson yields to a well-calibrated reference dataset [44]. The\r
luminosities extracted from both methods are in good agreement with each other.\r
The average number of interactions per bunch crossing (µ), typically referred to as pileup, was\r
4.7 and 0.14 for the pp and OO datasets, respectively. While pileup effects are negligible for\r
OO collisions, the pp data are corrected for pileup effects by repeating the measurement using\r
subsets taken at different times. These subsets sample µ ranging from 1.0 to 7.6 and are used to\r
extrapolate to µ ≈ 0. This is a 1.2% correction to the pp and RAA results.\r
Collision events are required to have at least one primary vertex [45] formed from two tracks\r
within 15 cm of the detector center in the z direction. Additionally, OO events are required to\r
produce energy deposits above 13 GeV in one or more detector elements on each side of the HF.\r
These requirements result in a selection inefficiency below 1% for events producing a charged\r
particle having pT > 3 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| < 1, and a correction for the remaining inef\u0002ficiency is applied. Similarly, residual contamination from ultraperipheral events [46] is found\r
to be negligible for this measurement. Ion beam contamination resulting from electromagnetic\r
dissociation processes [47] of 16O was found to be negligible for this analysis by studying the\r
time-dependence of event activity distributions [48].\r
The measurements reported here are for charged primary particles, which are defined as all\r
charged particles having an average proper lifetime cτ > 1 cm. Particles that result from\r
secondary decays are not considered primary if the parent particle is classified as primary.\r
Charged particles are examined using the hits they leave in the silicon tracker. Tracks and the\r
vertices from which they originate are reconstructed using algorithms discussed in Ref. [45].\r
Tracks must satisfy the “high purity” selection described therein to reduce contamination re\u0002sulting from spurious tracks not associated with a charged particle, also known as misrecon\u0002struction. Only tracks in the ranges |η| < 1 and 3.0 < pT < 103.6 GeV are used. If a track has\r
pT > 10 GeV, the relative uncertainty in its pTis required to be less than 10%, as determined\r
by the track fit. The misreconstruction rate of tracks is found to be below 1% in simulation. To\r
enhance the fraction of tracks that correspond to primary particles, the analysis only consid\u0002ers tracks having a distance of closest approach (DCA) to any primary vertex less than three\r
times the associated DCA uncertainty in both the x-y plane and z direction. In simulation,

3\r
contamination effects from secondary particles are around 0.5% after these selections. To facili\u0002tate cancellation of reconstruction effects and uncertainties when formulating the RAA observ\u0002able, identical track reconstruction procedures and selections are applied to both pp and OO\r
datasets.\r
The resulting tracking efficiency is evaluated using the PYTHIA [49] generator for pp collisions\r
and using PYTHIA overlaid with HIJING [50] for OO collisions. For a majority of particles con\u0002sidered (π\r
±, K±, p, and p), the efficiency is approximately constant at 90% in both collision\r
systems. Charged strange baryons (Σ\r
±, Ξ−, Ω−, and their antiparticles) have lifetimes long\r
enough to be considered primary particles, but mostly decay before traversing enough of the\r
tracker to be reconstructed. PYTHIA underestimates the production rates of strange particles in\r
pp [20] and pPb [26] collisions, resulting in a slight overestimation of the tracking efficiency.\r
To account for this effect, the relative production rates of different particle types in simulation\r
are weighted to match those in 7 TeV pp data [51, 52] using a procedure similar to the one\r
outlined in Ref. [20]. In pp collisions, this reduces the overall charged-particle reconstruction\r
efficiency calculated using PYTHIA by around 6% at pT = 3 GeV but results in a less than 1%\r
difference for pT > 8 GeV. For OO collisions, a similar procedure is used with an additional\r
extrapolation factor, based on control samples in data, that accounts for expected differences\r
between the OO and pp data. Motivated by measurements [26, 53] indicating that the hadron\r
composition of an event scales in a universal way with charged-particle density, dNch/dη, this\r
factor estimates the change of light-hadron production rates with event activity. Specifically,\r
the particle abundances used to weight the simulation are scaled in a pT-independent manner\r
from a pp-like working point of dNch/dη = 8 to the measured value for inclusive OO colli\u0002sions of dNch/dη ≈ 40 [54]. This amounts to an additional 3% correction at pT = 3 GeV which\r
decreases to below 1% for pT > 10 GeV. To compensate for track reconstruction inefficiencies,\r
residual track misreconstruction effects, and secondary-track contamination, correction factors\r
are applied on a track-by-track basis as functions of pT and η.\r
The uncertainty in the tracking efficiency due to the particle composition weighting proce\u0002dure has two components. The first is calculated by propagating the experimental uncertain\u0002ties in the input pp data through the entire procedure. This uncertainty is less than 2.0% for\r
pT > 10 GeV in the pp and OO cross sections but fully cancels in RAA. The second component\r
results from the extrapolation procedure used to account for differences between OO and pp\r
data. This component is calculated by examining two variations: one with no extrapolation and\r
one where the extrapolation goes to dNch/dη = 100, corresponding to the density expected in\r
the most head-on OO collisions. This uncertainty, which is only applicable to the OO spectra\r
and RAA measurements, is 3% at pT = 3 GeV and less than 1% at pT > 10 GeV. The uncer\u0002tainty caused by potential mismodeling of the tracking efficiency in simulation (other than the\r
previously discussed differences in the types of particles produced) is evaluated by comparing\r
the relative reconstruction efficiencies of pions coming from different D0 meson decays [55] in\r
13 TeV pp data. This uncertainty is 2.1% for both pp and OO collisions and cancels fully when\r
calculating RAA. To study the sensitivity of the measurement to secondary-track backgrounds,\r
the analysis is repeated after changing the DCA selection to require tracks to have less than two\r
or five times their DCA uncertainty. The maximum of the two variations is taken as a system\u0002atic uncertainty and is up to 3.5% in pp and 5.6% in OO collisions. This uncertainty is under\r
3.5% for RAA because of partial cancellations. The pp pileup correction factor of 1.2% is taken\r
as an uncertainty for the pp spectrum and RAA measurements. The uncertainty attributed to\r
bin migration effects caused by finite track pTresolution is less than 1% for the spectra measure\u0002ments and fully cancels in the RAA measurement. Uncertainties resulting from the luminosity\r
calibrations are not included in the total systematic uncertainty but are reported as a separate

4\r
normalization uncertainty that is fully correlated across all pT values probed. Summaries of the\r
systematic uncertainties as functions of pT are provided in Appendix A.2.\r

Figure 1: The charged-particle pT-differential invariant cross sections for pp (black circles) and\r
OO (blue squares) collisions. The markers show the average cross section across the entire bin\r
width, not the cross section value at the center of each bin. Statistical uncertainties are smaller\r
than the markers.\r
The charged-particle pT-differential cross sections are reported in Fig. 1. The cross sections are\r
scaled by 1/(4πpT) so that they are reported within a Lorentz-invariant phase space. System\u0002atic uncertainties, excluding the luminosity uncertainties, are shown in the lower panel. Both\r
spectra exhibit roughly power law behavior, which is consistent with previous measurements\r
of charged-particle spectra at these energies [19, 22, 29, 56, 57].\r
The solid markers in Fig. 2 display the measured charged-particle RAA for inclusive OO colli\u0002sions. The RAA shows significant pT dependence, with the lowest pT data having RAA around\r
0.77. As the probed pTincreases, the RAA exhibits a local minimum at around pT = 6 GeV\r
before increasing to a value consistent with unity at pT values approaching 100 GeV. The RAA\r
value of 0.69 ± 0.04 (systematic, with negligible statistical uncertainty) at the local minimum\r
is more than five standard deviations from unity, making this the first definitive observation\r
of particle suppression in OO collisions. The measurement uncertainty is dominated by uncer\u0002tainties in the overall normalization of the OO and pp cross sections arising from the luminosity\r
determination. For comparison, previous CMS measurements of the inclusive charged-particle

= 5.44 TeV [22]. The XeXe sample corresponds to the top 80% most\r
head-on collisions, which is expected to be close to the RAA values for an inclusive event se\u0002lection. The behavior of the OO RAA, i.e., a downward slope until around 6 GeV followed by\r
an upward trend approaching unity, is qualitatively similar to that observed in larger collision\r
systems such as XeXe and PbPb. In those systems, the downward slope at lower pTis typi\u0002cally attributed to the pT\r
-dependence of effects such as Cronin enhancement [58] and radial\r
flow [59, 60], whereas the magnitude and trend of suppression at higher pTis associated with\r
the strength of parton energy loss. An ordering with collision system size is apparent, with the\r
RAA for pPb collisions being above, and for XeXe and PbPb collisions being below the OO data.\r
Figure 3 shows a comparison of the OO RAA measurement to theoretical predictions. Models\r
in the upper row of panels will be discussed first. The green line in the upper left panel shows a\r

parton distribution functions (nPDFs) [70]. The outer green band represents the 68% confidence\r
level of the nPDF uncertainties, while the inner green band shows scale uncertainties of the cal\u0002culation. Comparisons to this model with other nPDF choices are shown in Appendix A.3. The\r

Figure 3: Comparison of the OO RAA measurement to various theoretical predictions [33, 36,\r

ergy loss model using the BDMPS-Z framework [36]. Some suppression of the RAA, particularly\r
in the range of pT < 20 GeV, can clearly be attributed to the baseline model, but the inclusion of\r
energy loss effects brings the model closer to the data. The red line in the upper left panel shows\r
a leading order calculation [37] interfaced with the EPS09 [71] nPDF set. This model predicts a\r
similar high-pT baseline but is less suppressed at lower pT values as compared to the one using\r
EPPS21. The red lines in the upper right panel shows the same model combined with the LCPI\r
energy loss framework [37]. The solid and dashed lines show scenarios where a QGP droplet,\r
denoted as “mQGP”, is or is not created in pp collisions, respectively. The inclusion of energy\r
loss effects clearly improves the agreement with the data, with the measurement favoring the\r
scenario where a QGP droplet is formed in pp collisions. The yellow band in the upper left\r
panel shows a NLO pQCD model using the EPPS16 [72] nPDF set. Here, the band represents\r
a 90% confidence interval. Similar high pT behavior is seen as in the other baseline models,\r
and less suppression is predicted at low pT, as compared to EPPS21. In the upper right panel,\r
this model is combined with the CLVisc (3+1)D hydrodynamics model [73], and energy loss is\r
included via the incorporation of a jet transport coefficient qˆ that is determined using Bayesian\r
inference techniques [61]. The uncertainty band illustrates the 90% confidence interval result\u0002ing from variations in qˆ. This model seems to qualitatively capture the shape of the data but\r
predicts a smaller suppression magnitude. The purple and gray bands show models that do\r
not include nPDF effects, i.e., the baseline without energy loss is equal to unity. The purple\r
band illustrates a prediction from the CUJET/CIBJET model [62, 63], which combines viscous

7\r
hydrodynamics with a DGLV theory of energy loss [74, 75]. The uncertainty band reflects vari\u0002ations in the strong coupling constant used. This model predicts a stronger suppression than\r
what is observed. A similar model utilizing DGLV radiative energy loss combined with colli\u0002sional energy loss and an additional short path length correction (SPLC) for small systems is\r
shown by the gray band [68]. The uncertainty reflects variations induced by the choice of the\r
cutoff momentum scales used. The central values give smaller RAA compared to data, but the\r
two are largely consistent within uncertainties for pT > 20 GeV.\r
The lower row of panels in Fig. 3 shows additional comparisons. The dark-green band in the\r
lower left panel shows a baseline calculation without energy loss effects that uses EPPS21. In\r
the lower right panel, the Hybrid model [64] has been used to add energy loss effects. In this\r
implementation, the Hybrid model is run using event-by-event hydrodynamics profiles [76].\r
Although the presence of energy loss effects causes a suppression of the RAA, the predicted\r
values are still above the data for most of the pTrange examined. The orange band in the\r
lower left panel illustrates a NLO pQCD baseline model [65] interfaced with EPPS21. In the\r
lower right panel, this model has energy loss effects added by coupling the model to event-by\u0002event hydrodynamics simulations and including coherent energy loss [66, 77–79]. The model is\r
consistent with the data within the uncertainties, although its central values illustrate a slightly\r
more pronounced pT-dependence. The dark-yellow band in the lower right panel shows the\r
JEWEL [67] MC generator which has been interfaced with the TRAJECTUM code [67, 80–82].\r
The model predicts a larger RAA value as compared to the data, with the values exceeding\r
unity at high pT. The JEWEL generator is expected to perform better when examining jets\r
rather than individual hadrons, which could explain this behavior. The pink band in the lower\r
right panel shows a model that extrapolates from PbPb RAA values using a path length integral\r
and the temperature profile experienced by partons as they travel through the medium, as\r
calculated using TRAJECTUM [67, 81–83]. This last model describes the data well.\r
The comparisons with models reveal conclusions that appear to be independent of the exact de\u0002tails of the model examined. Firstly, the role of nPDFs is clearly important—the oxygen nPDF\r
alone can potentially cause an RAA suppression up to half of that seen in data. Further nPDF\r
constraints coming from the recently-collected LHC OO and pO datasets may improve this in\r
the future. Secondly, models including energy loss effects describe RAA better than baseline\r
models. Most models capture the pT-dependent shape of RAA for pT > 10 GeV, but a sizable\r
spread exists in the predicted scale of RAA. Overall, the data are consistent with the presence\r
of parton energy loss effects in OO collisions, and this measurement places quantitative con\u0002straints on models incorporating energy loss in small collision systems.\r
In summary, we report the first measurement of the charged-particle nuclear modification fac\u0002tor (RAA) as a function of transverse momentum (pT\r
) in oxygen-oxygen collisions at a center\r
of mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV. The RAA is significantly suppressed and reaches\r
a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. However, RAA rises to become consistent with\r
unity for pT values approaching 100 GeV. Comparisons with previous measurements of other\r
collision systems reveal a system-size dependence of RAA suppression in nuclear collisions.\r
The data are more consistent with theoretical models that incorporate parton energy loss ef\u0002fects as compared to baseline models without energy loss, supporting the hypothesis that a\r
medium of sufficient size to give rise to observable parton energy loss is created. This measure\u0002ment constrains models attempting to predict jet quenching in small systems and represents an\r
important first step towards the realization of a physics program examining collisions of light\r
nuclei at TeV-scale energies.

A Additional material\r
A.1 Description of the CMS detector\r
The CMS apparatus [84, 85] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic detector, designed to trigger\r
on [86–88] and identify electrons, muons, photons, and hadrons [45, 89, 90]. A global “particle\u0002flow” algorithm [91] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, combining infor\u0002mation provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the crystal electromagnetic and brass\u0002scintillator hadron calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with data\r
from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.\r
The silicon tracker [92] measures charged particles up to |η| = 3.0 with typical resolutions of\r
2.0% in pT and 10–75 µm in the transverse impact parameter [93] for nonisolated particles of\r
1 < pT < 100 GeV. The hadron forward calorimeter uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers\r
as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m from the interaction\r
region, one on each end, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |η| < 5.2.\r
Simulated MC samples are used to evaluate detector performance and calculate correction fac\u0002tors. For pp collisions, the PYTHIA 8.311 event generator [49] with the CP5 tune [94] is em\u0002ployed. To study OO collisions, a PYTHIA event is overlaid with an OO HIJING v1.383 [50] event\r
to form a composite event containing both a hard scattering process as well as particle produc\u0002tion from the underlying event. Potential contamination from ultraperipheral collisions [46] is\r
studied using STARLIGHT v3.3.0 [95]. The GEANT4 [96] program is used to simulate the CMS\r
detector response. After event generation, an event-by-event weight is used to ensure that the\r
distribution of the z position of reconstructed primary interaction points in simulation matches\r
that in data.\r
A.2 Summaries of the uncertainties\r
A visual summary of the systematic uncertainties relevant for the spectra measured in this\r
analysis is shown in Fig. A.1. The integrated luminosity uncertainty is reported as a separate

16\r
uncertainty and is not included in the total coming from other sources. The non-monotonic\r
behavior at lower pT values results from propagating the experimental uncertainties of the\r
input ALICE data used for the particle species correction. Figure A.2 shows a similar summary\r
for the RAA measurement after correlations between the OO and pp measurements are taken\r
into account.\r

A.3 Comparison to different nPDF models\r
Figure A.3 shows the baseline model described in Refs. [33, 69] with three different nPDF hy\u0002potheses. The data lie under all three nPDF choices. The EPPS21 model predicts the strongest\r
nPDF modification of RAA, whereas the nNNPDF3.0 [97] and TUJU21 [98] nPDF sets pre\u0002dict a rather modest suppression effect. TUJU21 currently does not include LHC data having\r
hadronic final states. These data tend to favor a stronger shadowing of the gluon nPDF, so this\r
difference could potentially explain why TUJU21 and EPPS21 predict different behavior [99].\r
EPPS21 and nNNPDF3.0 include similar data in their global fits, but the models predict differ\u0002ent A-dependence of nPDF modifications. In particular, nuclear effects tend to be smaller for\r
low-A nuclei in nNNPDF3.0 as compared to EPPS21 [100].

Discovery of suppressed charged-particle production in\r
ultrarelativistic oxygen-oxygen collisions\r
The CMS Collaboration*\r
Abstract\r
A hot and dense state of nuclear matter, known as the quark-gluon plasma, is cre\u0002ated in collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy nuclei. Highly energetic quarks and glu\u0002ons, collectively referred to as partons, lose energy as they travel through this matter,\r
leading to suppressed production of particles with large transverse momenta (pT).\r
Conversely, high-pT particle suppression has not been seen in proton-lead collisions,\r
raising questions regarding the minimum system size required to observe parton en\u0002ergy loss. Oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions examine a region of effective system size\r
that lies between these two extreme cases. The CMS detector at the CERN LHC has\r
been used to quantify charged-particle production in inclusive OO collisions for the\r
first time via measurements of the nuclear modification factor (RAA). The RAA is de\u0002rived by comparing particle production to expectations based on proton-proton (pp)\r
data and has a value of unity in the absence of nuclear effects. The data for OO and\r
pp collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy √\r
s\r
NN\r
= 5.36 TeV correspond\r
to integrated luminosities of 6.1 nb−1and 1.02 pb−1, respectively. The RAA is below\r
unity with a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. The data exhibit better\r
agreement with theoretical models incorporating parton energy loss as compared to\r
baseline models without energy loss.\r

In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, a medium consisting of a hot and dense state of nu\u0002clear matter with deconfined quarks and gluons, known as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is\r
created [1, 2]. The QGP exhibits many striking properties, including fluid-like collective behav\u0002ior as well as mass- and flavor-dependent modification of particle production when compared\r
to expectations based on proton-proton (pp) data [3–8]. Understanding the dynamics of these\r
phenomena and how they emerge from the underlying theory of the strong force, quantum\r
chromodynamics (QCD) [9, 10], is a key goal of modern high-energy nuclear physics.\r
The microscopic structure of the QGP at short length scales, where individual quark and gluon\r
degrees of freedom are most salient, is experimentally accessible through the examination of\r
high-momentum scattering processes that can happen concurrently with QGP production [11].\r
The scattered quarks and gluons, collectively known as partons, can interact with the QGP\r
and lose energy via collisional and radiative processes [12]. This parton energy loss causes “jet\r
quenching”, a term used to describe the resulting modification of yields, energies, and spatial\r
distributions of particles originating from the initial scattered parton [13].\r
In hadron collider experiments, particles having transverse momentum (pT) greater than a few\r
GeV are almost entirely produced via the fragmentation and hadronization of high-energy par\u0002tons. Thus, high-pT particle spectra are sensitive to parton energy loss effects. Modifications of\r
these spectra are typically quantified using a ratio between the spectra of interest and a baseline\r
found using pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair (√\r
s\r
NN\r
). Specif\u0002ically, the relevant pp spectrum is scaled to account for the larger number of nucleon-nucleon\r
interactions in a nucleus-nucleus collision. Early measurements of this ratio, known as the nu\u0002clear modification factor (RAA), at the CERN SPS [14, 15], the BNL RHIC [5–8], and the CERN\r
LHC [16–18] were among the first indications of jet quenching at their respective collision en\u0002ergy scales. More recent charged-particle RAA measurements at the LHC using lead (208Pb)\r
collisions at √s\r
NN\r
= 5.02 TeV [19–21] and xenon (129Xe) collisions at 5.44 TeV [21–23] found\r
RAA to be in the range of 0.2–0.3 for particles with pT around 8 GeV, indicating significant jet\r
quenching effects in collisions of heavy nuclei.\r
In small collision systems, e.g., pp and pPb, observations of QGP-like effects including col\u0002lectivity [24] and the enhanced production of strange hadrons [25, 26], have prompted ques\u0002tions of whether a small droplet of QGP can be produced in such collisions [27]. However, jet\r
quenching has not been observed in these systems [28–31], and the pPb RAA is close to unity at\r
particle pT > 2 GeV [19, 21, 32]. The absence of a jet quenching signal could be attributable to\r
a lack of QGP production, or alternatively, the very short path length a parton would have to\r
traverse to exit a QGP droplet. It has been proposed to experimentally test the latter hypoth\u0002esis using collisions of light nuclei having low nuclear mass number (A). Such collisions will\r
potentially create a QGP volume in between those of pPb and heavier ion collisions [33]. These\r
intermediate systems are also less sensitive to initial-state energy density fluctuations that hin\u0002der theoretical descriptions of smaller systems [34, 35]. Theoretical models incorporating jet\r
quenching have predicted charged-particle RAA suppression that should be experimentally ac\u0002cessible, of the order of 25% for A = 16 at LHC energies [33, 36–38].\r
In 2025, the LHC delivered TeV-scale collisions of 16O nuclei for the first time. This Letter\r
presents the first measurement of the pT-differential cross section of charged-particle produc\u0002tion in oxygen-oxygen (OO) collisions at √\r
s\r
NN\r
= 5.36 TeV using data collected by the CMS\r
experiment. A reference spectrum measured using pp data from 2024 at the same collision en\u0002ergy is also reported. The charged-particle RAA for inclusive OO collisions is then constructed

2\r
using the following definition:\r

\u0013 \u001E \u0012dσ\r
pp\r
dpT\r
\u0013\u0015 , (1)\r
where σ\r
AA (σpp) is the cross section for charged-particle production in nucleus-nucleus (pp)\r
collisions. Notably, because the prefactor accounting for the number of nucleons in 16O is\r
exact, this formulation does not contain any model-dependent uncertainties, e.g., from Glauber\r
modeling [39, 40]. The OO data are compared to other collision systems at similar √\r
s\r
NN\r
, as well\r
as predictions from theoretical models. Tabulated results are provided in the HEPData record\r
for this analysis [41].\r
A description of the CMS detector and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations used to evaluate\r
its performance can be found in Appendix A.1. The pp data were collected using a trigger\r
that only required two coincident colliding bunches in the detector, while the OO data were\r
collected using a trigger that searched for one or more energy deposits of at least 7 GeV in\r
either of the forward hadron (HF) calorimeters. The total integrated luminosity utilized was\r
1.02 ± 0.03 pb−1for the pp sample and 6.1 ± 0.2 nb−1for the OO sample. These values are\r
determined by combining two independent measurements. The first is a preliminary analysis\r
of van der Meer scan [42, 43] data. A second luminosity determination was conducted using a\r
method that compares observed Z boson yields to a well-calibrated reference dataset [44]. The\r
luminosities extracted from both methods are in good agreement with each other.\r
The average number of interactions per bunch crossing (µ), typically referred to as pileup, was\r
4.7 and 0.14 for the pp and OO datasets, respectively. While pileup effects are negligible for\r
OO collisions, the pp data are corrected for pileup effects by repeating the measurement using\r
subsets taken at different times. These subsets sample µ ranging from 1.0 to 7.6 and are used to\r
extrapolate to µ ≈ 0. This is a 1.2% correction to the pp and RAA results.\r
Collision events are required to have at least one primary vertex [45] formed from two tracks\r
within 15 cm of the detector center in the z direction. Additionally, OO events are required to\r
produce energy deposits above 13 GeV in one or more detector elements on each side of the HF.\r
These requirements result in a selection inefficiency below 1% for events producing a charged\r
particle having pT > 3 GeV and pseudorapidity |η| < 1, and a correction for the remaining inef\u0002ficiency is applied. Similarly, residual contamination from ultraperipheral events [46] is found\r
to be negligible for this measurement. Ion beam contamination resulting from electromagnetic\r
dissociation processes [47] of 16O was found to be negligible for this analysis by studying the\r
time-dependence of event activity distributions [48].\r
The measurements reported here are for charged primary particles, which are defined as all\r
charged particles having an average proper lifetime cτ > 1 cm. Particles that result from\r
secondary decays are not considered primary if the parent particle is classified as primary.\r
Charged particles are examined using the hits they leave in the silicon tracker. Tracks and the\r
vertices from which they originate are reconstructed using algorithms discussed in Ref. [45].\r
Tracks must satisfy the “high purity” selection described therein to reduce contamination re\u0002sulting from spurious tracks not associated with a charged particle, also known as misrecon\u0002struction. Only tracks in the ranges |η| < 1 and 3.0 < pT < 103.6 GeV are used. If a track has\r
pT > 10 GeV, the relative uncertainty in its pTis required to be less than 10%, as determined\r
by the track fit. The misreconstruction rate of tracks is found to be below 1% in simulation. To\r
enhance the fraction of tracks that correspond to primary particles, the analysis only consid\u0002ers tracks having a distance of closest approach (DCA) to any primary vertex less than three\r
times the associated DCA uncertainty in both the x-y plane and z direction. In simulation,

3\r
contamination effects from secondary particles are around 0.5% after these selections. To facili\u0002tate cancellation of reconstruction effects and uncertainties when formulating the RAA observ\u0002able, identical track reconstruction procedures and selections are applied to both pp and OO\r
datasets.\r
The resulting tracking efficiency is evaluated using the PYTHIA [49] generator for pp collisions\r
and using PYTHIA overlaid with HIJING [50] for OO collisions. For a majority of particles con\u0002sidered (π\r
±, K±, p, and p), the efficiency is approximately constant at 90% in both collision\r
systems. Charged strange baryons (Σ\r
±, Ξ−, Ω−, and their antiparticles) have lifetimes long\r
enough to be considered primary particles, but mostly decay before traversing enough of the\r
tracker to be reconstructed. PYTHIA underestimates the production rates of strange particles in\r
pp [20] and pPb [26] collisions, resulting in a slight overestimation of the tracking efficiency.\r
To account for this effect, the relative production rates of different particle types in simulation\r
are weighted to match those in 7 TeV pp data [51, 52] using a procedure similar to the one\r
outlined in Ref. [20]. In pp collisions, this reduces the overall charged-particle reconstruction\r
efficiency calculated using PYTHIA by around 6% at pT = 3 GeV but results in a less than 1%\r
difference for pT > 8 GeV. For OO collisions, a similar procedure is used with an additional\r
extrapolation factor, based on control samples in data, that accounts for expected differences\r
between the OO and pp data. Motivated by measurements [26, 53] indicating that the hadron\r
composition of an event scales in a universal way with charged-particle density, dNch/dη, this\r
factor estimates the change of light-hadron production rates with event activity. Specifically,\r
the particle abundances used to weight the simulation are scaled in a pT-independent manner\r
from a pp-like working point of dNch/dη = 8 to the measured value for inclusive OO colli\u0002sions of dNch/dη ≈ 40 [54]. This amounts to an additional 3% correction at pT = 3 GeV which\r
decreases to below 1% for pT > 10 GeV. To compensate for track reconstruction inefficiencies,\r
residual track misreconstruction effects, and secondary-track contamination, correction factors\r
are applied on a track-by-track basis as functions of pT and η.\r
The uncertainty in the tracking efficiency due to the particle composition weighting proce\u0002dure has two components. The first is calculated by propagating the experimental uncertain\u0002ties in the input pp data through the entire procedure. This uncertainty is less than 2.0% for\r
pT > 10 GeV in the pp and OO cross sections but fully cancels in RAA. The second component\r
results from the extrapolation procedure used to account for differences between OO and pp\r
data. This component is calculated by examining two variations: one with no extrapolation and\r
one where the extrapolation goes to dNch/dη = 100, corresponding to the density expected in\r
the most head-on OO collisions. This uncertainty, which is only applicable to the OO spectra\r
and RAA measurements, is 3% at pT = 3 GeV and less than 1% at pT > 10 GeV. The uncer\u0002tainty caused by potential mismodeling of the tracking efficiency in simulation (other than the\r
previously discussed differences in the types of particles produced) is evaluated by comparing\r
the relative reconstruction efficiencies of pions coming from different D0 meson decays [55] in\r
13 TeV pp data. This uncertainty is 2.1% for both pp and OO collisions and cancels fully when\r
calculating RAA. To study the sensitivity of the measurement to secondary-track backgrounds,\r
the analysis is repeated after changing the DCA selection to require tracks to have less than two\r
or five times their DCA uncertainty. The maximum of the two variations is taken as a system\u0002atic uncertainty and is up to 3.5% in pp and 5.6% in OO collisions. This uncertainty is under\r
3.5% for RAA because of partial cancellations. The pp pileup correction factor of 1.2% is taken\r
as an uncertainty for the pp spectrum and RAA measurements. The uncertainty attributed to\r
bin migration effects caused by finite track pTresolution is less than 1% for the spectra measure\u0002ments and fully cancels in the RAA measurement. Uncertainties resulting from the luminosity\r
calibrations are not included in the total systematic uncertainty but are reported as a separate

4\r
normalization uncertainty that is fully correlated across all pT values probed. Summaries of the\r
systematic uncertainties as functions of pT are provided in Appendix A.2.\r

an upward trend approaching unity, is qualitatively similar to that observed in larger collision\r
systems such as XeXe and PbPb. In those systems, the downward slope at lower pTis typi\u0002cally attributed to the pT\r

ergy loss model using the BDMPS-Z framework [36]. Some suppression of the RAA, particularly\r
in the range of pT < 20 GeV, can clearly be attributed to the baseline model, but the inclusion of\r
energy loss effects brings the model closer to the data. The red line in the upper left panel shows\r
a leading order calculation [37] interfaced with the EPS09 [71] nPDF set. This model predicts a\r
similar high-pT baseline but is less suppressed at lower pT values as compared to the one using\r
EPPS21. The red lines in the upper right panel shows the same model combined with the LCPI\r
energy loss framework [37]. The solid and dashed lines show scenarios where a QGP droplet,\r
denoted as “mQGP”, is or is not created in pp collisions, respectively. The inclusion of energy\r
loss effects clearly improves the agreement with the data, with the measurement favoring the\r
scenario where a QGP droplet is formed in pp collisions. The yellow band in the upper left\r
panel shows a NLO pQCD model using the EPPS16 [72] nPDF set. Here, the band represents\r
a 90% confidence interval. Similar high pT behavior is seen as in the other baseline models,\r
and less suppression is predicted at low pT, as compared to EPPS21. In the upper right panel,\r
this model is combined with the CLVisc (3+1)D hydrodynamics model [73], and energy loss is\r
included via the incorporation of a jet transport coefficient qˆ that is determined using Bayesian\r
inference techniques [61]. The uncertainty band illustrates the 90% confidence interval result\u0002ing from variations in qˆ. This model seems to qualitatively capture the shape of the data but\r
predicts a smaller suppression magnitude. The purple and gray bands show models that do\r
not include nPDF effects, i.e., the baseline without energy loss is equal to unity. The purple\r
band illustrates a prediction from the CUJET/CIBJET model [62, 63], which combines viscous

7\r
hydrodynamics with a DGLV theory of energy loss [74, 75]. The uncertainty band reflects vari\u0002ations in the strong coupling constant used. This model predicts a stronger suppression than\r
what is observed. A similar model utilizing DGLV radiative energy loss combined with colli\u0002sional energy loss and an additional short path length correction (SPLC) for small systems is\r
shown by the gray band [68]. The uncertainty reflects variations induced by the choice of the\r
cutoff momentum scales used. The central values give smaller RAA compared to data, but the\r
two are largely consistent within uncertainties for pT > 20 GeV.\r
The lower row of panels in Fig. 3 shows additional comparisons. The dark-green band in the\r
lower left panel shows a baseline calculation without energy loss effects that uses EPPS21. In\r
the lower right panel, the Hybrid model [64] has been used to add energy loss effects. In this\r
implementation, the Hybrid model is run using event-by-event hydrodynamics profiles [76].\r
Although the presence of energy loss effects causes a suppression of the RAA, the predicted\r
values are still above the data for most of the pTrange examined. The orange band in the\r
lower left panel illustrates a NLO pQCD baseline model [65] interfaced with EPPS21. In the\r
lower right panel, this model has energy loss effects added by coupling the model to event-by\u0002event hydrodynamics simulations and including coherent energy loss [66, 77–79]. The model is\r
consistent with the data within the uncertainties, although its central values illustrate a slightly\r
more pronounced pT-dependence. The dark-yellow band in the lower right panel shows the\r
JEWEL [67] MC generator which has been interfaced with the TRAJECTUM code [67, 80–82].\r
The model predicts a larger RAA value as compared to the data, with the values exceeding\r
unity at high pT. The JEWEL generator is expected to perform better when examining jets\r
rather than individual hadrons, which could explain this behavior. The pink band in the lower\r
right panel shows a model that extrapolates from PbPb RAA values using a path length integral\r
and the temperature profile experienced by partons as they travel through the medium, as\r
calculated using TRAJECTUM [67, 81–83]. This last model describes the data well.\r
The comparisons with models reveal conclusions that appear to be independent of the exact de\u0002tails of the model examined. Firstly, the role of nPDFs is clearly important—the oxygen nPDF\r
alone can potentially cause an RAA suppression up to half of that seen in data. Further nPDF\r
constraints coming from the recently-collected LHC OO and pO datasets may improve this in\r
the future. Secondly, models including energy loss effects describe RAA better than baseline\r
models. Most models capture the pT-dependent shape of RAA for pT > 10 GeV, but a sizable\r
spread exists in the predicted scale of RAA. Overall, the data are consistent with the presence\r
of parton energy loss effects in OO collisions, and this measurement places quantitative con\u0002straints on models incorporating energy loss in small collision systems.\r
In summary, we report the first measurement of the charged-particle nuclear modification fac\u0002tor (RAA) as a function of transverse momentum (pT\r
) in oxygen-oxygen collisions at a center\r
of mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV. The RAA is significantly suppressed and reaches\r
a minimum of 0.69 ± 0.04 around pT = 6 GeV. However, RAA rises to become consistent with\r
unity for pT values approaching 100 GeV. Comparisons with previous measurements of other\r
collision systems reveal a system-size dependence of RAA suppression in nuclear collisions.\r
The data are more consistent with theoretical models that incorporate parton energy loss ef\u0002fects as compared to baseline models without energy loss, supporting the hypothesis that a\r
medium of sufficient size to give rise to observable parton energy loss is created. This measure\u0002ment constrains models attempting to predict jet quenching in small systems and represents an\r
important first step towards the realization of a physics program examining collisions of light\r
nuclei at TeV-scale energies."""

A Additional material\r
A.1 Description of the CMS detector\r
The CMS apparatus [84, 85] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic detector, designed to trigger\r
on [86–88] and identify electrons, muons, photons, and hadrons [45, 89, 90]. A global “particle\u0002flow” algorithm [91] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, combining infor\u0002mation provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the crystal electromagnetic and brass\u0002scintillator hadron calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with data\r
from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the flux-return yoke outside the solenoid.\r
The silicon tracker [92] measures charged particles up to |η| = 3.0 with typical resolutions of\r
2.0% in pT and 10–75 µm in the transverse impact parameter [93] for nonisolated particles of\r
1 < pT < 100 GeV. The hadron forward calorimeter uses steel as an absorber and quartz fibers\r
as the sensitive material. The two halves of the HF are located 11.2 m from the interaction\r
region, one on each end, and together they provide coverage in the range 3.0 < |η| < 5.2.\r
Simulated MC samples are used to evaluate detector performance and calculate correction fac\u0002tors. For pp collisions, the PYTHIA 8.311 event generator [49] with the CP5 tune [94] is em\u0002ployed. To study OO collisions, a PYTHIA event is overlaid with an OO HIJING v1.383 [50] event\r
to form a composite event containing both a hard scattering process as well as particle produc\u0002tion from the underlying event. Potential contamination from ultraperipheral collisions [46] is\r
studied using STARLIGHT v3.3.0 [95]. The GEANT4 [96] program is used to simulate the CMS\r
detector response. After event generation, an event-by-event weight is used to ensure that the\r
distribution of the z position of reconstructed primary interaction points in simulation matches\r
that in data.\r
A.2 Summaries of the uncertainties\r
A visual summary of the systematic uncertainties relevant for the spectra measured in this\r
analysis is shown in Fig. A.1. The integrated luminosity uncertainty is reported as a separate

16\r
uncertainty and is not included in the total coming from other sources. The non-monotonic\r
behavior at lower pT values results from propagating the experimental uncertainties of the\r
input ALICE data used for the particle species correction. Figure A.2 shows a similar summary\r
for the RAA measurement after correlations between the OO and pp measurements are taken\r
into account.\r

A.3 Comparison to different nPDF models\r
Figure A.3 shows the baseline model described in Refs. [33, 69] with three different nPDF hy\u0002potheses. The data lie under all three nPDF choices. The EPPS21 model predicts the strongest\r
nPDF modification of RAA, whereas the nNNPDF3.0 [97] and TUJU21 [98] nPDF sets pre\u0002dict a rather modest suppression effect. TUJU21 currently does not include LHC data having\r
hadronic final states. These data tend to favor a stronger shadowing of the gluon nPDF, so this\r
difference could potentially explain why TUJU21 and EPPS21 predict different behavior [99].\r
EPPS21 and nNNPDF3.0 include similar data in their global fits, but the models predict differ\u0002ent A-dependence of nPDF modifications. In particular, nuclear effects tend to be smaller for\r
low-A nuclei in nNNPDF3.0 as compared to EPPS21 [100].
