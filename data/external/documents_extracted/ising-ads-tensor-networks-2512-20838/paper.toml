(Dated: December 25, 2025)\r
We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Prod\u0002uct States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular\r
tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this\r
model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to\r
probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory\r
and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary\u0002boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the\r
Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are\r
able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the\r
entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one\u0002dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits\r
a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure\r
Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Gravitational theories are conjectured to be holographic\r
in nature; that is the gravitational degrees of freedom\r
associated with some region of spacetime can be repre\u0002sented by quantum fields residing on the boundary of that\r
region [1, 2]. In the case of an anti-de Sitter spacetime,\r
the aysymptotic boundary is flat, and the boundary de\u0002grees of freedom are encoded in a conformal field theory\r
[3]. This holographic correspondence typically maps a\r
weakly coupled bulk gravitational theory to a strongly\r
coupled boundary theory. This motivates one to try\r
to study such theories using non-perturbative methods.\r
Since Monte Carlo methods cannot be used for these sys\u0002tems because of sign problems one is led to investigate\r
numerical methods that can be used in a Hamiltonian for\u0002mulation. In principle, such calculations could be done\r
using quantum computers, but this is not feasible with\r
current hardware and algorithms. In (1+1) dimensions,\r
classical tensor network methods provide extremely effi\u0002cient alternatives [4, 5]. However, it is generally thought\r
that such methods will not be effective when they are\r
lifted to (2+1) dimensional systems [5] due to the need for\r
very large bond dimensions. In this paper we will show\r
that the constant ratio of bulk to boundary sites, which\r
is typical of hyperbolic lattices, allows us to use MPS\r
methods reliably in system sizes larger than a regular 2d\r

square lattice. In fact these methods can be adapted to\r
study such systems with as many as a few hundred lattice\r
sites.\r
Specifically, we have used methods based on Matrix\r
Product States (MPS) to study the ground state and time\r
evolution of the quantum Ising model formulated on a\r
discretization of two-dimensional hyperbolic space, which\r
we can think of as a spatial slice of three-dimensional\r
anti-de Sitter space. We investigate the phase structure\r
of this theory and the properties of the associated bound\u0002ary theory which is gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees\r
of freedom. It should be noted from the outset that since\r
the bulk tessellation is fixed the construction does not\r
include any gravitational fluctuations, so any effective\r
boundary theory likely does not contain a local energy\u0002momentum tensor. Nevertheless, the model can be seen\r
as a step along the path toward the construction of a\r
true discrete holographic model that can be explored us\u0002ing future quantum computers.\r
Using tensor networks or quantum circuits to simulate\r
holographic physics is not a new idea, and there have\r
been a great number of earlier studies on related topics.\r
The most well-known is the Multi-Scale Renormalization\r
Ansatz (MERA)[6], which uses a set of disentangling ma\u0002trices to remove local entanglement between sites thereby\r
achieving the entanglement scaling expected for gap\u0002less theories. In addition there have been a plethora of\r
works where tensor networks have been implemented us\u0002ing hyperbolic tessellations [7–11], in addition to tessel\u0002lations of superconducting qubits[12, 13] and circuit im\u0002plementations of hyperbolic tessellations[14, 15]. It has\r
been shown that Matchgate Tensor network calculations,\r
which can be related to disordered Ising models, capture\r

holographic expectations very well[16, 17].\r
Our work, in contrast, starts with a disorder-free mixed\r
field Ising model and uses a matrix product state (MPS)\r
ansatz to capture the wavefunction of low-lying states.\r
To obtain the ground state of this system, we use the\r
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algo\u0002rithm [18]. In addition to this, we also study the dynam\u0002ical properties of this model by representing the Hamil\u0002tonian as a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) and imple\u0002menting time evolution by using the Time Evolving Block\r
Decimation (TEBD) algorithm [19]. Using TEBD we cal\u0002culate Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators (OTOCs)[20–\r
25] and investigate quantum chaos and information prop\u0002agation in this system.\r
Our goal in this paper is to see how far we can push\r
simple tensor network methods like TEBD and DMRG\r
to study holographic physics and where these approaches\r
break down, signaling the need for better algorithms or\r
the use of quantum algorithms.\r
II. ISING MODEL ON ANTI-DE SITTER SPACE\r
The Hamiltonian we study is given by,\r
HIsing = −\r
\r
Jzz X\r
⟨j,k⟩\r
ZjZk +\r
X\r
j\r
(JxXj + mZj )\r
\r
 (1)\r
where X, Y, Z represent standard Pauli matrices\r
σ\r
x\r
, σy, σzrespectively and {j, k} are lattice site indices.\r
Jzz is the nearest neighbor coupling applied on sites that\r
are connected on the tessellation, and Jx is the transverse\r
coupling. We add a small mass m to break the model’s\r
Z2 symmetry which is required to lift the degeneracy in\r
the ground state of the system.\r
We study this model using Hamiltonian-based, quantum\u0002inspired tensor networks - Matrix Product States (MPS) -\r
which give an approximate representation of the quantum\r
state of a many-body system. As is well known, the MPS\r
ansatz is inherently a one-dimensional construction, but\r
it is possible to generalize the method by building an\r
MPS that snakes through a two-dimensional lattice. This\r
approach performs well for simulating strip geometries,\r
but it is limited due to the scaling of the entanglement\r
entropy in the extra dimension, which requires very large\r
bond dimensions as the extra dimension size grows larger.\r
Our objective in this work is to find out if this approach\r
can be used to simulate models defined on hyperbolic tes\u0002sellations, in which a large proportion of spins live on the\r
boundary of the lattice, which limits the amount of long\r
range interaction needed to capture the 2d dynamics.\r
The ground state of the model is found using the Density\r
Matrix Renormalization (DMRG) method. The DMRG\r
algorithm provides an efficient and systematically im\u0002provable framework for simulating strongly correlated\r
quantum many-body systems in one spatial dimension\r
[4, 5]. Within this framework, DMRG operates as a varia\u0002tional optimization algorithm over the MPS manifold, de\u0002livering ground states and low-lying excitations with con\u0002trollable accuracy as the bond dimension χbond increases.\r
Importantly, for high-energy and lattice gauge theory ap\u0002plications, MPS-based approaches can explicitly incorpo\u0002rate gauge symmetries into the local tensor structure,\r
thereby enabling ab initio Hamiltonian simulations of\r
confinement, string breaking, and non-equilibrium dy\u0002namics without suffering from sign problems. This makes\r
tensor networks a powerful complementary tool to Monte\r
Carlo methods, offering a controlled and versatile route\r
to explore regimes of lattice field theories that are other\u0002wise inaccessible. [18, 19, 26–29]\r
Time evolution is implemented via the Time Evolving\r
Block Decimation (TEBD) algorithm. Other time evolu\u0002tion algorithms like Time Dependent Variational princi\u0002ple (TDVP)[30] could also be useful for this setup, which

FIG. 2: Bulk phase transition for 12x12 square lattice\r
flat space Ising model with m = 0.001\r
we plan to explore in future work. Before we move on\r
to the details of the hyperbolic construction let’s review\r
the basics of MPS/MPO methods. In general any quan\u0002tum state can be expanded on the tensor product of the\r
Hilbert spaces associated with the quantum spins on each\r
lattice site\r
Ψ = X\r
i1,...iN\r
ci1...iN |s1⟩ ⊗ |s2⟩ ⊗ · · · |sN ⟩ (2)\r
The MPS ansatz assumes that the coefficients ci1...iN can\r
be written as the trace of a product of matrices M of size\r
χbond - the bond dimension:\r
ci1...iN = Tr Mi1. . . MiN\r
\u0001\r
(3)\r
The size of χbond controls the amount of entanglement\r
that can be faithfully captured in the approximation.\r
This construction is particularly well-suited for systems\r
whose low-energy states satisfy an area law, such as those\r
encountered in spin chains and gauge theories discretized\r
on one-dimensional spatial lattices. To describe opera\u0002tors we use a Matrix Product Operator(MPO) descrip\u0002tion, which can be given as,\r
Oˆ =\r

MPOs provide a natural representation for local Hamil\u0002tonians, which we use in our DMRG and TEBD studies.\r

After contraction, this returns an MPS with a higher\r
bond dimension but of the same form. Using these two\r
building blocks, we can then obtain the ground state\r
of a quantum system represented by an MPS using the\r
DMRG algorithm, which uses a variational method on\r
the matrix parameters to find an approximation to the\r
ground state. To capture dynamics one can represent\r
the time evolution operator as an MPO and implement\r
discrete Trotter time evolution of the MPS.\r
In our model, we start from a tessellation of two\u0002dimensional hyperbolic space H2 and obtain a one\u0002dimensional MPS chain by winding out from the center of\r
the tessellation along successive layers until the bound\u0002ary is reached. The order of the matrices in the MPS\r
ansatz follows the order of the sites as shown in Fig. 1\r
for a (3, 7) triangulated lattice consisting of 29 vertices\r
(3-layers) where the edges represent the 2 body interac\u0002tions and spins are located at the vertices. Grey edges\r
represent the original MPS description and the red edges\r
represent the long-range interactions needed to capture\r
the 2d characteristics.\r
III. RESULTS\r
In this section we show results obtained using the DMRG\r
algorithm implemented within the ITensor module [31].\r
A. Bulk properties\r
As a sanity check of our implementation of 2d MPS\r
method, we first simulate the flat two-dimensional Ising\r
model on a square lattice, whose bulk phase transition\r
can be captured by the magnetic susceptibility given by\r

This is shown in Fig. 2. The observed critical point at\r

Now that we have some confidence that our implementa\u0002tion works for a square lattice, let’s first check the conver\u0002gence of the ground state energy as a function of bond di\u0002mension for the case of a hyperbolic lattice. Fig. 3 shows\r
the ground state energy obtained using the DMRG algo\u0002rithm as we increase the bond-dimension χbond at cou\u0002pling Jzz/Jx = 0.31 for a three-layer tessellation. We\r
see that the ground state energy converges quickly with\r
increasing bond dimension and levels off at bond dimen\u0002sions higher than 400. Similar to the flat case to capture\r
the phase transition, we investigate the magnetic suscep\u0002tibility. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we plot the magnetic sus\u0002ceptibility and magnetization, respectively, as a function\r
of coupling for the hyperbolic lattice model of five-layer\r
tessellation. Right of this transition point, we have the\r
disordered phase, and to the left of it we have the ordered\r
phase.\r
Table I lists the number of points for three different lat\u0002tice volumes used in this work. The last column shows\r
the number of boundary points in a given tessellation.\r
B. Boundary Correlators\r
It is interesting to study the spin correlation function\r
when both source and sink points are restricted to the\r
boundary of the tessellated disk δD. In particular, we\r

can plot this as a function of distance between source\r
and sink along the boundary. The correlation function is\r
defined as,\r

where Nb is the number of boundary vertices in the tri\u0002angulation and r is the boundary distance between the\r
source and sink.\r
This has been studied before using classical simulations\r
of scalars and Ising spins in hyperbolic space [33, 34]. In\r
particular, one expects the correlator to be determined\r
by the minimal length lattice path between source and\r
sink, which, for the hyperbolic space, runs through the\r
bulk. Because of the structure of the tessellation, this

minimal path length scales only logarithmically with the\r
boundary separation. This in turn, has the effect of pro\u0002ducing a power law dependence on boundary distance\r
even for a theory that is gapped in the bulk.\r
To analyze the correlators, we first fold the data about\r
r = (Nb − 1)/2 points and then use the data smoothing\r
procedure as explained in [35] with a smoothing window\r
of three lattice spacings. Then we fit a power law function\r
f(r) = Ar−B + D to this folded and smoothed data.\r
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows these correlator fits for the\r
three and four layer lattice. Fig. 8 shows how the power\r
obtained from these fits varies as a function of the bulk\r

the boundary-boundary correlation function decays as a\r
power law, as expected.\r
Notice that the power approaches a minimum as the bulk\r
coupling is tuned towards its critical value. For reference,\r
we draw on the plot a horizontal line corresponding to\r
that expected for a two-dimensional free fermion. This\r
above mentioned minimal value lies close to that of a\r
two-dimensional free fermion.\r
C. Out of time ordered correlators(OTOCs)\r
In this section, we calculate out-of-time-ordered correla\u0002tors in the infinite temperature limit, which are defined\r
as\r
Oij (t) = ⟨||[Zi(t), Zj (0)]||2⟩ (8)\r
= 2 \u00101 − Re[⟨Z\r
†\r
i\r
(t)Zj (0)†Zi(t)Zj (0)⟩]\r
\u0011\r
(9)\r
where, lattice site i is the source point and j is the sink.\r
We obtain the time evolved operators Zi(t) by expressing\r
the Hamiltonian as an MPO and implementing Heisen\u0002berg evolution via the time-evolving block decimation\r
(TEBD) algorithm. The system’s state is represented as\r
an MPS, and time evolution under the Hamiltonian H\r
is implemented using a Trotter–Suzuki decomposition of\r
the evolution operator e\r
−iHt into a sequence of two-site\r
unitary gates. After each local gate application, singu\u0002lar value decomposition (SVD) is used to truncate small\r
Schmidt coefficients, keeping the MPS within a fixed\r
bond dimension [5, 36–38].\r
These time-dependent correlators probe how the infor\u0002mation in an initial local quantum state spreads through\u0002out the system as a result of the dynamics. Generically,

6\r
local quantum information is scrambled into non-local\r
degrees of freedom under time evolution. It is closely\r
related to the problem of thermalization in quantum sys\u0002tems and to the presence of chaotic dynamics. In the lat\u0002ter case quantum information spreads exponentially fast\r
through a system and allows one to define a Lyapunov\r
exponent from the behavior of the OTOC in a manner\r
similar to a classical chaotic system. Holographic sys\u0002tems corresponding to black holes are thought to furnish\r
examples of so-called fast scramblers, and so it is inter\u0002esting to look for such behavior in our toy holographic\r
model.\r
Our results for the time dependence of OTOCs initialized\r
at both the center and a boundary site are given in Fig. 9\r
and Fig. 10, respectively. The generic form of these cor\u0002responds to a rapid rise and then an oscillating approach\r
to an equilibrium plateau. From the initial rapid expo\u0002nential growth in these OTOCs, we extract Lyapunov\r
exponents characterizing the chaotic nature of the dy\u0002namics. One example of such a fit is given in Fig. 11\r
It is also useful to construct heatmap plots that show the\r
magnitude of the OTOC as a function of position for sev\u0002eral successive times. These are shown in Fig. 12(a,b,c)\r
at three different time-slices for an initial source at the\r
center site and Fig. 12(d,e,f) when the source is at the\r
first boundary site. The sources are diamond shaped and\r
colored in red. In both cases we observe the spreading of\r
the quantum state as a function of time in agreement with\r
expectations. Notice in the case of the center source, the\r
signal spreads in a way that is approximately consistent\r
with the symmetries of the lattice.\r
In the case where the source is placed on the boundary,\r
we see that information propagates towards the bulk first\r
and not along the boundary, this is consistent with the\r
geodesics in hyperbolic spaces, where the shortest path\r
between two boundary sites is not on the boundary but\r
goes through the bulk. However, our MPS ansatz does\r
not exhibit exact rotational symmetry, and this is re\u0002flected in the heatmap plots, Fig. 12\r
D. Sub-region entropies\r
In this subsection, we will study the scaling of the entan\u0002glement entropy Sℓ = −Tr [ρ(ℓ) log (ρ(ℓ))] with respect\r
to the subsystem size ℓ. In general, to calculate the en\u0002tanglement entropy, the system with L spins is divided\r
into two subsystems A and B of size ℓ and L − ℓ respec\u0002tively and the resultant density matrix is defined by\r
ρ(ℓ) = TrB |Ψ⟩ ⟨Ψ| (10)\r
where ρ(ℓ) denotes the eigenvalues of the reduced density\r
matrix.\r
Initially, let us focus just on the effective boundary theory\r
which can be obtained by constructing the density matrix\r
from the MPS corresponding to the ground state of the\r

requires partial traces over the full density matrix of the\r
spins on the hyperbolic graph. To do this, we make use\r

Entropy of the boundary theory with respect to the sub\u0002system size.\r

with unity, which might be expected if the boundary CFT\r
at the bulk critical point corresponded to a free Dirac\r
fermion. Away from the critical point and deeper in the\r
disordered phase, we see a linear behavior (see Fig. 14).\r
From our boundary correlator results, one would have\r
expected that the boundary theory would be governed\r
by a CFT even when the bulk is gapped. However, our\r
measurement of the entanglement scaling shows no evi\u0002dence of this, which we interpret as arising from the fact\r
that one expects the boundary theory to be governed by\r
a non-local Hamiltonian for a generic value of the bulk\r
coupling. This shows the drawback of this method in\r
simulating AdS/CFT physics compared to MERA and\r
similar constructions, where a critical boundary theory is\r
built iteratively, and a logarithm is observed for all cou\u0002plings. It is possible that the desired logarithmic scaling\r
will show up at bigger volumes with much larger bond di\u0002mension, but with our current computational resources,\r
we see no evidence of this.\r
We can also compute the entanglement entropy for the\r
full system by progressively tracing out subregions start\u0002ing from the central node. In this case, we find that\r
the entropy peaks when the subregion reaches the first\r
boundary node and then decreases. This is true both\r
at criticality and away from it in the disordered phase.\r
Fig. 15 shows these findings for a four-layer lattice, re\u0002spectively. This kind of behavior is known as volume law\r
scaling and is expected to appear in highly connected\r
and chaotic systems [40]. Interestingly, MPS methods\r
that normally exhibit area law scaling capture this vol\u0002ume law scaling behavior when overlaid on a hyperbolic\r
tessellation, which shows us that even though our de\u0002scription fails to capture the criticality of the boundary\r
theory accurately, it still manages to capture the bulk\r
behavior well.\r
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r
In this work we have shown that using the matrix prod\u0002uct state ansatz and a variety of standard tensor network\r
algorithms, one can study simple Hamiltonian theories\r
residing on tessellations of hyperbolic space. In the con\u0002tinuum limit, this enables us to probe quantum field the\u0002ories on three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In prac\u0002tice, we have studied the quantum Ising model as the\r
simplest system in this class and have restricted our cal\u0002culations to systems with no more than 232 spins. Notice\r
that this is still vastly larger than what could be achieved\r
using exact diagonalization.\r
One can think of this lattice system as a simple discrete\r
model for understanding certain aspects of holography.\r
To this end, we have computed spatial boundary cor\u0002relation functions at fixed time and for different values\r
of the bulk coupling, finding a power law behavior for\r
any value of the bulk coupling in the disordered phase,\r
as one expects on the basis of the (discrete) symmetries\r
of hyperbolic space. Indeed our results suggest that the\r
boundary theory corresponds to a free fermion CFT when\r
the bulk is tuned to criticality.\r
Our computations of the boundary entanglement entropy\r
however, show that the logarithmic dependence on sub\u0002region size expected for a true CFT is only realized at\r
the bulk critical point - away from this coupling, a lin\u0002ear scaling is seen. We attribute this to the fact that\r
the effective CFT gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees\r
of freedom is generically non-local unless we tune to the\r
bulk critical point.\r
We have also examined out-of-time-ordered (OTOC) cor\u0002relators for both bulk and boundary spins. We are able\r
to fit the short-time behavior to an exponential function\r
and extract a corresponding Lyapunov exponent. There\r
seems to be some evidence of scrambling.\r
In general our measurements of dynamics highlight some\r
of the problems associated with the MPS ansatz - we see a\r
lack of rotational invariance in the heatmaps that show\u0002case time evolution. In addition, the tensor approach\r
appears to be limited to modest system sizes of just a\r
few hundred degrees of freedom. To simulate larger sys\u0002tems we will need to employ better classical algorithms\r
or quantum computers.

(Dated: December 25, 2025)\r
We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Prod\u0002uct States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular\r
tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this\r
model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to\r
probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory\r
and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary\u0002boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the\r
Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are\r
able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the\r
entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one\u0002dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits\r
a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure\r
Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Gravitational theories are conjectured to be holographic\r
in nature; that is the gravitational degrees of freedom\r
associated with some region of spacetime can be repre\u0002sented by quantum fields residing on the boundary of that\r
region [1, 2]. In the case of an anti-de Sitter spacetime,\r
the aysymptotic boundary is flat, and the boundary de\u0002grees of freedom are encoded in a conformal field theory\r
[3]. This holographic correspondence typically maps a\r
weakly coupled bulk gravitational theory to a strongly\r
coupled boundary theory. This motivates one to try\r
to study such theories using non-perturbative methods.\r
Since Monte Carlo methods cannot be used for these sys\u0002tems because of sign problems one is led to investigate\r
numerical methods that can be used in a Hamiltonian for\u0002mulation. In principle, such calculations could be done\r
using quantum computers, but this is not feasible with\r
current hardware and algorithms. In (1+1) dimensions,\r
classical tensor network methods provide extremely effi\u0002cient alternatives [4, 5]. However, it is generally thought\r
that such methods will not be effective when they are\r
lifted to (2+1) dimensional systems [5] due to the need for\r
very large bond dimensions. In this paper we will show\r
that the constant ratio of bulk to boundary sites, which\r
is typical of hyperbolic lattices, allows us to use MPS\r
methods reliably in system sizes larger than a regular 2d\r

square lattice. In fact these methods can be adapted to\r
study such systems with as many as a few hundred lattice\r
sites.\r
Specifically, we have used methods based on Matrix\r
Product States (MPS) to study the ground state and time\r
evolution of the quantum Ising model formulated on a\r
discretization of two-dimensional hyperbolic space, which\r
we can think of as a spatial slice of three-dimensional\r
anti-de Sitter space. We investigate the phase structure\r
of this theory and the properties of the associated bound\u0002ary theory which is gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees\r
of freedom. It should be noted from the outset that since\r
the bulk tessellation is fixed the construction does not\r
include any gravitational fluctuations, so any effective\r
boundary theory likely does not contain a local energy\u0002momentum tensor. Nevertheless, the model can be seen\r
as a step along the path toward the construction of a\r
true discrete holographic model that can be explored us\u0002ing future quantum computers.\r
Using tensor networks or quantum circuits to simulate\r
holographic physics is not a new idea, and there have\r
been a great number of earlier studies on related topics.\r
The most well-known is the Multi-Scale Renormalization\r
Ansatz (MERA)[6], which uses a set of disentangling ma\u0002trices to remove local entanglement between sites thereby\r
achieving the entanglement scaling expected for gap\u0002less theories. In addition there have been a plethora of\r
works where tensor networks have been implemented us\u0002ing hyperbolic tessellations [7–11], in addition to tessel\u0002lations of superconducting qubits[12, 13] and circuit im\u0002plementations of hyperbolic tessellations[14, 15]. It has\r
been shown that Matchgate Tensor network calculations,\r
which can be related to disordered Ising models, capture\r

holographic expectations very well[16, 17].\r
Our work, in contrast, starts with a disorder-free mixed\r
field Ising model and uses a matrix product state (MPS)\r
ansatz to capture the wavefunction of low-lying states.\r
To obtain the ground state of this system, we use the\r
Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algo\u0002rithm [18]. In addition to this, we also study the dynam\u0002ical properties of this model by representing the Hamil\u0002tonian as a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) and imple\u0002menting time evolution by using the Time Evolving Block\r
Decimation (TEBD) algorithm [19]. Using TEBD we cal\u0002culate Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlators (OTOCs)[20–\r
25] and investigate quantum chaos and information prop\u0002agation in this system.\r
Our goal in this paper is to see how far we can push\r
simple tensor network methods like TEBD and DMRG\r
to study holographic physics and where these approaches\r
break down, signaling the need for better algorithms or\r
the use of quantum algorithms.\r
II. ISING MODEL ON ANTI-DE SITTER SPACE\r
The Hamiltonian we study is given by,\r
HIsing = −\r
\r
Jzz X\r
⟨j,k⟩\r
ZjZk +\r
X\r
j\r
(JxXj + mZj )\r
\r
 (1)\r
where X, Y, Z represent standard Pauli matrices\r
σ\r
x\r
, σy, σzrespectively and {j, k} are lattice site indices.\r
Jzz is the nearest neighbor coupling applied on sites that\r
are connected on the tessellation, and Jx is the transverse\r
coupling. We add a small mass m to break the model’s\r
Z2 symmetry which is required to lift the degeneracy in\r
the ground state of the system.\r
We study this model using Hamiltonian-based, quantum\u0002inspired tensor networks - Matrix Product States (MPS) -\r
which give an approximate representation of the quantum\r
state of a many-body system. As is well known, the MPS\r
ansatz is inherently a one-dimensional construction, but\r
it is possible to generalize the method by building an\r
MPS that snakes through a two-dimensional lattice. This\r
approach performs well for simulating strip geometries,\r
but it is limited due to the scaling of the entanglement\r
entropy in the extra dimension, which requires very large\r
bond dimensions as the extra dimension size grows larger.\r
Our objective in this work is to find out if this approach\r
can be used to simulate models defined on hyperbolic tes\u0002sellations, in which a large proportion of spins live on the\r
boundary of the lattice, which limits the amount of long\r
range interaction needed to capture the 2d dynamics.\r
The ground state of the model is found using the Density\r
Matrix Renormalization (DMRG) method. The DMRG\r
algorithm provides an efficient and systematically im\u0002provable framework for simulating strongly correlated\r
quantum many-body systems in one spatial dimension\r
[4, 5]. Within this framework, DMRG operates as a varia\u0002tional optimization algorithm over the MPS manifold, de\u0002livering ground states and low-lying excitations with con\u0002trollable accuracy as the bond dimension χbond increases.\r
Importantly, for high-energy and lattice gauge theory ap\u0002plications, MPS-based approaches can explicitly incorpo\u0002rate gauge symmetries into the local tensor structure,\r
thereby enabling ab initio Hamiltonian simulations of\r
confinement, string breaking, and non-equilibrium dy\u0002namics without suffering from sign problems. This makes\r
tensor networks a powerful complementary tool to Monte\r
Carlo methods, offering a controlled and versatile route\r
to explore regimes of lattice field theories that are other\u0002wise inaccessible. [18, 19, 26–29]\r
Time evolution is implemented via the Time Evolving\r
Block Decimation (TEBD) algorithm. Other time evolu\u0002tion algorithms like Time Dependent Variational princi\u0002ple (TDVP)[30] could also be useful for this setup, which

we plan to explore in future work. Before we move on\r
to the details of the hyperbolic construction let’s review\r
the basics of MPS/MPO methods. In general any quan\u0002tum state can be expanded on the tensor product of the\r
Hilbert spaces associated with the quantum spins on each\r
lattice site\r

The MPS ansatz assumes that the coefficients ci1...iN can\r
be written as the trace of a product of matrices M of size\r
χbond - the bond dimension:\r
ci1...iN = Tr Mi1. . . MiN\r
\u0001\r
(3)\r
The size of χbond controls the amount of entanglement\r
that can be faithfully captured in the approximation.\r
This construction is particularly well-suited for systems\r
whose low-energy states satisfy an area law, such as those\r
encountered in spin chains and gauge theories discretized\r
on one-dimensional spatial lattices. To describe opera\u0002tors we use a Matrix Product Operator(MPO) descrip\u0002tion, which can be given as,\r

After contraction, this returns an MPS with a higher\r
bond dimension but of the same form. Using these two\r
building blocks, we can then obtain the ground state\r
of a quantum system represented by an MPS using the\r
DMRG algorithm, which uses a variational method on\r
the matrix parameters to find an approximation to the\r
ground state. To capture dynamics one can represent\r
the time evolution operator as an MPO and implement\r
discrete Trotter time evolution of the MPS.\r
In our model, we start from a tessellation of two\u0002dimensional hyperbolic space H2 and obtain a one\u0002dimensional MPS chain by winding out from the center of\r
the tessellation along successive layers until the bound\u0002ary is reached. The order of the matrices in the MPS\r
ansatz follows the order of the sites as shown in Fig. 1\r
for a (3, 7) triangulated lattice consisting of 29 vertices\r
(3-layers) where the edges represent the 2 body interac\u0002tions and spins are located at the vertices. Grey edges\r
represent the original MPS description and the red edges\r
represent the long-range interactions needed to capture\r
the 2d characteristics.\r
III. RESULTS\r
In this section we show results obtained using the DMRG\r
algorithm implemented within the ITensor module [31].\r
A. Bulk properties\r
As a sanity check of our implementation of 2d MPS\r
method, we first simulate the flat two-dimensional Ising\r
model on a square lattice, whose bulk phase transition\r
can be captured by the magnetic susceptibility given by\r

Now that we have some confidence that our implementa\u0002tion works for a square lattice, let’s first check the conver\u0002gence of the ground state energy as a function of bond di\u0002mension for the case of a hyperbolic lattice. Fig. 3 shows\r
the ground state energy obtained using the DMRG algo\u0002rithm as we increase the bond-dimension χbond at cou\u0002pling Jzz/Jx = 0.31 for a three-layer tessellation. We\r
see that the ground state energy converges quickly with\r
increasing bond dimension and levels off at bond dimen\u0002sions higher than 400. Similar to the flat case to capture\r
the phase transition, we investigate the magnetic suscep\u0002tibility. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we plot the magnetic sus\u0002ceptibility and magnetization, respectively, as a function\r
of coupling for the hyperbolic lattice model of five-layer\r
tessellation. Right of this transition point, we have the\r
disordered phase, and to the left of it we have the ordered\r
phase.\r
Table I lists the number of points for three different lat\u0002tice volumes used in this work. The last column shows\r
the number of boundary points in a given tessellation.\r
B. Boundary Correlators\r
It is interesting to study the spin correlation function\r
when both source and sink points are restricted to the\r
boundary of the tessellated disk δD. In particular, we\r

defined as,\r

source and sink.\r
This has been studied before using classical simulations\r
of scalars and Ising spins in hyperbolic space [33, 34]. In\r
particular, one expects the correlator to be determined\r
by the minimal length lattice path between source and\r
sink, which, for the hyperbolic space, runs through the\r
bulk. Because of the structure of the tessellation, this

minimal path length scales only logarithmically with the\r
boundary separation. This in turn, has the effect of pro\u0002ducing a power law dependence on boundary distance\r
even for a theory that is gapped in the bulk.\r
To analyze the correlators, we first fold the data about\r
r = (Nb − 1)/2 points and then use the data smoothing\r
procedure as explained in [35] with a smoothing window\r
of three lattice spacings. Then we fit a power law function\r
f(r) = Ar−B + D to this folded and smoothed data.\r
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows these correlator fits for the\r
three and four layer lattice. Fig. 8 shows how the power\r

Notice that the power approaches a minimum as the bulk\r
coupling is tuned towards its critical value. For reference,\r
we draw on the plot a horizontal line corresponding to\r
that expected for a two-dimensional free fermion. This\r
above mentioned minimal value lies close to that of a\r
two-dimensional free fermion.\r
C. Out of time ordered correlators(OTOCs)\r
In this section, we calculate out-of-time-ordered correla\u0002tors in the infinite temperature limit, which are defined\r
as\r
Oij (t) = ⟨||[Zi(t), Zj (0)]||2⟩ (8)\r
= 2 \u00101 − Re[⟨Z\r
†\r
i\r
(t)Zj (0)†Zi(t)Zj (0)⟩]\r
\u0011\r
(9)\r
where, lattice site i is the source point and j is the sink.\r
We obtain the time evolved operators Zi(t) by expressing\r
the Hamiltonian as an MPO and implementing Heisen\u0002berg evolution via the time-evolving block decimation\r
(TEBD) algorithm. The system’s state is represented as\r
an MPS, and time evolution under the Hamiltonian H\r
is implemented using a Trotter–Suzuki decomposition of\r
the evolution operator e\r
−iHt into a sequence of two-site\r
unitary gates. After each local gate application, singu\u0002lar value decomposition (SVD) is used to truncate small\r
Schmidt coefficients, keeping the MPS within a fixed\r
bond dimension [5, 36–38].\r
These time-dependent correlators probe how the infor\u0002mation in an initial local quantum state spreads through\u0002out the system as a result of the dynamics. Generically,

6\r
local quantum information is scrambled into non-local\r
degrees of freedom under time evolution. It is closely\r
related to the problem of thermalization in quantum sys\u0002tems and to the presence of chaotic dynamics. In the lat\u0002ter case quantum information spreads exponentially fast\r
through a system and allows one to define a Lyapunov\r
exponent from the behavior of the OTOC in a manner\r
similar to a classical chaotic system. Holographic sys\u0002tems corresponding to black holes are thought to furnish\r
examples of so-called fast scramblers, and so it is inter\u0002esting to look for such behavior in our toy holographic\r
model.\r
Our results for the time dependence of OTOCs initialized\r
at both the center and a boundary site are given in Fig. 9\r
and Fig. 10, respectively. The generic form of these cor\u0002responds to a rapid rise and then an oscillating approach\r
to an equilibrium plateau. From the initial rapid expo\u0002nential growth in these OTOCs, we extract Lyapunov\r
exponents characterizing the chaotic nature of the dy\u0002namics. One example of such a fit is given in Fig. 11\r
It is also useful to construct heatmap plots that show the\r
magnitude of the OTOC as a function of position for sev\u0002eral successive times. These are shown in Fig. 12(a,b,c)\r
at three different time-slices for an initial source at the\r
center site and Fig. 12(d,e,f) when the source is at the\r
first boundary site. The sources are diamond shaped and\r
colored in red. In both cases we observe the spreading of\r
the quantum state as a function of time in agreement with\r
expectations. Notice in the case of the center source, the\r
signal spreads in a way that is approximately consistent\r
with the symmetries of the lattice.\r
In the case where the source is placed on the boundary,\r
we see that information propagates towards the bulk first\r
and not along the boundary, this is consistent with the\r
geodesics in hyperbolic spaces, where the shortest path\r
between two boundary sites is not on the boundary but\r
goes through the bulk. However, our MPS ansatz does\r
not exhibit exact rotational symmetry, and this is re\u0002flected in the heatmap plots, Fig. 12\r
D. Sub-region entropies\r
In this subsection, we will study the scaling of the entan\u0002glement entropy Sℓ = −Tr [ρ(ℓ) log (ρ(ℓ))] with respect\r
to the subsystem size ℓ. In general, to calculate the en\u0002tanglement entropy, the system with L spins is divided\r
into two subsystems A and B of size ℓ and L − ℓ respec\u0002tively and the resultant density matrix is defined by\r
ρ(ℓ) = TrB |Ψ⟩ ⟨Ψ| (10)\r
where ρ(ℓ) denotes the eigenvalues of the reduced density\r
matrix.\r
Initially, let us focus just on the effective boundary theory\r
which can be obtained by constructing the density matrix\r
from the MPS corresponding to the ground state of the\r

full system and then tracing over the bulk indices. This\r
requires partial traces over the full density matrix of the\r
spins on the hyperbolic graph. To do this, we make use\r
of the routines provided in the ITensorEntropyTools.jl\r
module [39].\r
Once the reduced density matrix corresponding to the\r
boundary is obtained, we divide the boundary into two\r
regions to investigate the scaling of the Von-Neumann\r
Entropy of the boundary theory with respect to the sub\u0002system size.\r
We observe that the boundary entanglement entropy\r
scales logarithmically with subregion length at the crit\u0002ical point (see Fig. 13). The fitted central charge (ob-

tained by a simple least squares procedure) is consistent\r
with unity, which might be expected if the boundary CFT\r
at the bulk critical point corresponded to a free Dirac\r
fermion. Away from the critical point and deeper in the\r
disordered phase, we see a linear behavior (see Fig. 14).\r
From our boundary correlator results, one would have\r
expected that the boundary theory would be governed\r
by a CFT even when the bulk is gapped. However, our\r
measurement of the entanglement scaling shows no evi\u0002dence of this, which we interpret as arising from the fact\r
that one expects the boundary theory to be governed by\r
a non-local Hamiltonian for a generic value of the bulk\r
coupling. This shows the drawback of this method in\r
simulating AdS/CFT physics compared to MERA and\r
similar constructions, where a critical boundary theory is\r
built iteratively, and a logarithm is observed for all cou\u0002plings. It is possible that the desired logarithmic scaling\r
will show up at bigger volumes with much larger bond di\u0002mension, but with our current computational resources,\r
we see no evidence of this.\r
We can also compute the entanglement entropy for the\r
full system by progressively tracing out subregions start\u0002ing from the central node. In this case, we find that\r
the entropy peaks when the subregion reaches the first\r
boundary node and then decreases. This is true both\r
at criticality and away from it in the disordered phase.\r
Fig. 15 shows these findings for a four-layer lattice, re\u0002spectively. This kind of behavior is known as volume law\r
scaling and is expected to appear in highly connected\r
and chaotic systems [40]. Interestingly, MPS methods\r
that normally exhibit area law scaling capture this vol\u0002ume law scaling behavior when overlaid on a hyperbolic\r
tessellation, which shows us that even though our de\u0002scription fails to capture the criticality of the boundary\r
theory accurately, it still manages to capture the bulk\r
behavior well.\r
IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r
In this work we have shown that using the matrix prod\u0002uct state ansatz and a variety of standard tensor network\r
algorithms, one can study simple Hamiltonian theories\r
residing on tessellations of hyperbolic space. In the con\u0002tinuum limit, this enables us to probe quantum field the\u0002ories on three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In prac\u0002tice, we have studied the quantum Ising model as the\r
simplest system in this class and have restricted our cal\u0002culations to systems with no more than 232 spins. Notice\r
that this is still vastly larger than what could be achieved\r
using exact diagonalization.\r
One can think of this lattice system as a simple discrete\r
model for understanding certain aspects of holography.\r
To this end, we have computed spatial boundary cor\u0002relation functions at fixed time and for different values\r
of the bulk coupling, finding a power law behavior for\r
any value of the bulk coupling in the disordered phase,\r
as one expects on the basis of the (discrete) symmetries\r
of hyperbolic space. Indeed our results suggest that the\r
boundary theory corresponds to a free fermion CFT when\r
the bulk is tuned to criticality.\r
Our computations of the boundary entanglement entropy\r
however, show that the logarithmic dependence on sub\u0002region size expected for a true CFT is only realized at\r
the bulk critical point - away from this coupling, a lin\u0002ear scaling is seen. We attribute this to the fact that\r
the effective CFT gotten by tracing out the bulk degrees\r
of freedom is generically non-local unless we tune to the\r
bulk critical point.\r
We have also examined out-of-time-ordered (OTOC) cor\u0002relators for both bulk and boundary spins. We are able\r
to fit the short-time behavior to an exponential function\r
and extract a corresponding Lyapunov exponent. There\r
seems to be some evidence of scrambling.\r
In general our measurements of dynamics highlight some\r
of the problems associated with the MPS ansatz - we see a\r
lack of rotational invariance in the heatmaps that show\u0002case time evolution. In addition, the tensor approach\r
appears to be limited to modest system sizes of just a\r
few hundred degrees of freedom. To simulate larger sys\u0002tems we will need to employ better classical algorithms\r
or quantum computers.
