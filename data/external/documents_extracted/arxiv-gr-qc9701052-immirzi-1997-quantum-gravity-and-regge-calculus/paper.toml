II meeting on Constrained Dynamics and Quantum Gravity, Santa Margherita Ligure, Sept.96.\r
For Tullio Regge on his 65th birthday\r
This is an informal review of the formulation of canonical general relativity and of its implications for quantum\r
gravity; the various versions are compared, both in the continuum and in a discretized approximation suggested\r
by Regge calculus. I also show that the weakness of the link with the geometric content of the theory gives rise\r
to what I think is a serious flaw in the claimed derivation of a discrete structure for space at the quantum level.\r
1. Introduction\r
From chromodynamics, I have inherited the\r
prejudice that a decent quantum field theory\r
must have a credible discrete approximation. Be\u0002ing deep rooted, this prejudice resists counterex\u0002amples. In particular, Regge calculus [1] makes\r
the geometric content of General Relativity so\r
clear that I find difficult to believe that a suc\u0002cessful quantization scheme would not originate,\r
or translate cleanly into this discretized approxi\u0002mation. And therefore, I am reluctant to add the\r
quantization of Regge calculus to the list of coun\u0002terexamples, in spite of the modest success which\r
the various attempts have achieved [2–5], and of\r
the unquestionable fact that what progress there\r
has been has been achieved ignoring this point of\r
view.\r
I shall give a quick sketch of the recent work\r
on canonical quantization of gravity, and a ten\u0002tative critique of this work in the light of what\r
I claim Regge calculus would suggest, with side\r
comments on the meaning of the results so far\r
obtained. So, in spite of the rather generic title,\r
I shall mention only a small fraction of the work\r
going on.\r
The idea that gravity should be treated as a\r
connection theory underlies all the work I shall\r
be considering, and this is where I shall begin;\r
the other main ingredient is the idea of the ”loop\r
representation” of Rovelli and Smolin, which has\r
evolved into a theory of ”Spin nets”, and this will\r
be discussed next, with a brief summary of the\r
striking and very recent progress that has taken\r
place. Here I shall try and explain why I think\r
that these results are spoilt by the imperfect link\r
of the theory with the geometric content of gen\u0002eral relativity. The crucial importance of this link\r
will be illustrated using Regge calculus as an ex\u0002ample.\r
2. Connections and constraints.\r
If the aim is to formulate canonical general rel\u0002ativity as a some sort of gauge theory on 3–space,\r
we have various options[6].\r
Option (1) is A.D.M. geometrodynamics\r
rewritten as a connection theory.\r
One follows A.D.M. taking space slices Σ\r
t\r
:\r
t(x) =const., with a congruencet\r

A.D.M. start with the Einstein–Hilbert action S = 12κ R √−g R d4x, while here one starts with\r
an actionS=\r
14κ\r
R\r
ǫIJKLe\r
I\r
∧e\r
J\r
∧RKL (where\r
RKL is the curvature 2–form of the Levi–Civita\r
connection ΩIJ , andκ := (8πGN ewton)/c\r
3\r
), and\r
the further choice is made to partially fix the O(3, 1) gauge freedom setting: e0a = −na = N∂at (1)\r
This choice (”time gauge”) leaves invariance un\u0002der local O(3) transformations, with e\r
ia, i\r
=\r
1,2, 3 space–like to provide a local frame on the

2\r
slice. The pull–back of ΩIJ to the space slice gives\r
the 3–d L.C. connection Γi\r
a\r
:= 1\r
2\r
q\r
b\r
a\r
ǫjikΩ\r

b\r
, and\r
the extrinsic curvature Ki\r
a\r
:= q\r
b\r
a Ω\r
0i\r
b = e\r
ibKab.\r
As canonical variables we take the pair:\r
(E\r
ia := 1\r
2\r
ǫ\r
abcǫijke\r
j\r
b\r
e\r
k\r
c = det(e\r
i\r
a\r
) e\r
ia , Ki\r
a\r
) (2)\r
They form a canonical pair, just like the\r
(qab, πab := √\r
q(Kab −q\r
abK) variables of A.D.M.,\r
because EiaEib = q qab implies:\r
Ki\r
a\r
δEia =\r
1\r
2\r
√\r
q\r
Kabδ(E\r
iaEib) = −\r
1\r
2\r
π\r
ab δqab (3)\r
The Γi\r
a have curvature Ri\r
ab, and can be ex\u0002pressed in terms of Eia (and its inverse) solving\r
the 9 linear equations they satisfy:\r
DaE\r
ia = 0 ; ǫijkEa\r
i E\r
(b\r
j DaE\r
c)\r
k = 0 (4)\r
We need to impose the A.D.M. constraint, and\r
to constrain Ki\r
a\r
to make sure that Kab =\r
√\r
1\r
q\r
qbc Ec\r
i Ki\r
a\r
is symmetrical; altogether:\r
Gi:= ǫijkKj\r
aE\r
ka ≈ 0\r
Vc := qbc∇aπ\r
ab = 2Ea\r
i D[aKi\r
c] ≈ 0\r

det E\r

ab) ≈ 0\r
Everything can be rewitten in terms of 2×2 matri\u0002ces saturating i, j, . . . indices with τi\r
:= σi/(2i);\r
so for ex. the effect of local rotations becomes:\r
E\r
a\r
:= τiE\r
ia → U Ea U−1\r
Γa := τiΓ\r
i\r
a → U (Γa + ∂a)U\r
−1\r
(5)\r
There is nothing particularly new about any of\r
this; in particular Ki\r
a fits into the scheme poorly,\r
like an external field, and the connection is a de\u0002rived quantity.\r
Option (2) is a shrewd variation on the theme\r
devised by J. F. Barbero[7,6], in a re–examination\r
of the Ashtekar[8] formulation.\r
For some β to be fixed, we can change our basic\r
variables as follows:\r
(E\r
ia, Ki\r
a\r
) → (E\r
ia , A(β)i\r
a\r
:= Γi\r
a + β Kia\r
) (6)\r
which is a canonical transformation, because\r
E\r
ia δA(β)i\r
a = βEia δKi\r
a +\r
1\r
2\r
∂a(˜ǫ\r
abcek\r
b\r

c\r
) (7)\r
so that:\r
{A\r
(β)i\r
a\r
(x), Ejb(y)} = βκ δi\r
j\r
δ\r
b\r
a\r
δ(x, y) (8)\r
and all other Poisson brackets vanish (in partic\u0002ular, {A\r
(β)i\r
a , A(β)j\r
b\r
} = 0). However unlike Ki\r
a\r
,\r
A\r
(β)i\r
a transforms like an SU(2) connection for any\r
β, and one can introduce D\r
(β)\r
a derivatives and\r
a curvature F\r
(β)i\r
ab . Using the properties of the\r
Levi–Civita connection and a bit of algebra the\r
constraints become:\r
D\r
(β)\r
a E\r
ia = βGi ≈ 0\r
E\r
iaF\r
(β)i\r
ab = β Vb + β\r

where the dots are terms proportional to βGi and\r
its derivatives.\r
Clearly the first two constraints are in an ac\u0002ceptable form, and the last one is not: the bit pro\u0002portional to (1 + β\r
2\r
) is a mess, the overall factor\r
1/\r
p\r
det(E) is unpleasant. As for this last point:\r
we either learn to live with the factor, or we ig\u0002nore it, absorbing it in the Lagrange multiplier.\r
The messy bit is more troublesome. The quick\u0002est way to get rid of it would be to take β = i.\r
This is Ashtekar’s original choice (together with\r
the idea of absorbing the factor 1/\r
p\r
det(E) in\r
the Lagrange multiplier)[8] . The point is that\r
there is much more to be said for this choice: it\r
is (or, one can convince oneself that it is) the\r
one choice that is geometrically and physically\r
well motivated. In fact the connection A\r
(i)i\r
a is\r
the pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual\r
connection, and Eia the pull–back of the self–dual\r
product of two vierbeins:\r

(9)\r
This definition of E\r
ia coincides with eq. (2) if\r
we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1); for the defi\u0002nition of A\r
(i)i\r
a to coincide with eq. (6) we have\r
to assume ”time gauge” and to impose explicitly

3\r
that the connection ΩIJ\r
a\r
is Levi–Civita, which fol\u0002lows if we add to the constraints the real part of\r
the second eq. (4) as a brand new ”reality” con\u0002dition. The result is, I think, physically splendid,\r
because we retain the full Lorentz group as gauge\r
group of the canonical theory, but technically ap\u0002palling, because of the obvious complications im\u0002plicit in the use of complex variables. In particu\u0002lar, the i which now occurs in the Poisson brack\u0002ets eq. (8) puts all simple minded quantizations\r
on collision course with the desire to have the\r
operators corrsponding to Eia hermitean. More\r
particularly, I have not found a way round this\r
difficulty, simple minded or not.\r
The alternative that has become most popu\u0002lar is to take β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”.\r
I would like to claim that the trouble with this\r
choice is that the connection has no obvious geo\u0002metric meaning, and that there is nothing special\r
about the value 1. In fact, β can be anything,\r
and I shall leave it arbitrary (but real > 0) in the\r
following. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the sec\u0002ond term of H is proportional to (1−β\r
2\r
), and the\r
choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”nat\u0002ural” for the (-+++) signature, but that’s not\r
saying much, unless somehow we learn to ”Wick–\r
rotate” the theory. For this possibility [6] see\r
later.\r
There are at least two smart ways out of the\r
inconvenience that Ki\r
a\r
is a complicated function\r
of A\r
(β)i\r
a and Eia (so that the expression of H\r
is messy), which come by roundabout arguments\r
devised by T. Thiemann[9]. I begin by listing\r
some identities; let f(x), h(x) be nice test func\u0002tions on Σ, and\r
HE[f] := Z\r

V [h] := Z\r

then one can work out the following remarkable\r
Poisson brackets:\r

iaEjb\r
I shall ignore possible problems with boundary\r
terms, write simply V := V [1], T := T [1], HE :=\r
HE[1], and summarize the above as:\r
{H\r
E, V } = 2β2κ2T ; {T, Eia} = Eia\r
{T, Γ\r
i\r
a\r
} = 0 ; {T, Ki\r
a\r
} = −Ki\r
a\r
(12)\r
One use of these identities could be to rewrite H\r
in the (possibly more manageable) form:\r
βκ\r
2\r
H = {A\r
(β)i\r
a\r
, V }ǫ\r

, V }ǫ\r
abcǫijk{A\r
(β)j\r
b\r
, T }{A\r
(β)k\r
c\r
, T }\r
This is the line followed by T. Thiemann in [9],\r
and claimed to be a runaway success.\r
A more fancy approach starts from the obser\u0002vation that the Hamiltonian evolution induced by\r
some H on a function f on phase space is given\r
by the map:\r
WH (t)◦ f := f +t{f, H}+\r
t\r
2\r
2! {{f, H}, H}+..(14)\r
which preserves Poisson brackets etc.; further\u0002more, from eq.(12):\r
WT (t) ◦ E\r
ia = e−tEia\r
WT (t) ◦ A\r
(β)i\r
a = Γia + βetKia\r
(15)\r
One may say that this relation shows explicitly\r
that the value of β does not matter, since it can\r
be changed at will (which is the point I am try\u0002ing to make). More boldly, that it gives us a way\r
to go from the Barbero to the Ashtekar connec\u0002tion, setting t = iπ/2 if we had β = 1 [10,6] .\r
This idea of a ”Wick rotation” is striking, but I\r
find it very difficult to articulate. In particular,\r
I find difficult to understand how the transfor\u0002mation brings about a change of (gauge) symme\u0002try group. I nevertheless regard this as the most\r
promising clue to the construction of a satisfac\u0002tory quantum theory within this set of ideas.

3. Spin nets.\r
To quantize the theory we may use the connec\u0002tion representation, in which states are function\u0002als of A\r
(β)i\r
a (x), and\r
E\r
ia → Eˆia :=\r
βκ¯h\r
i\r
δ\r
δA(β)i\r
a\r
(16)\r
The important states turn out to be ”spin net\r
states”, which are an obvious generalization of\r
Wilson loops.\r
4\r
3\r

Take for ex. the net in the picture, which\r
has 5 vertices and 10 lines, and lives in a space\r
with a connection A\r
(β)i\r
a ; assign to each line\r
γl an orientation, hence a ”transporter” gl:=\r
P exp R\r
l\r
τiA\r
(β)i\r
a dγa\r
l\r
, and a spin sl = 0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . .,\r
so that γl → Dsl\r
mm′ (gl); assign to each vertex v\r
an SU(2) invariant tensor C\r
v\r
ma,..,md\r
, and we shall\r
have that:\r
ψn(g1, ..., g10) = X\r
{m}\r
Y\r
v\r
C\r
v\r
... Y\r
l\r
D\r
sl\r
.. (gl) (17)\r
is gauge invariant. If gl ∈ SU(2), and we indi\u0002cate by dgl the Haar measure, these states form a\r
(smallish) Hilbert space with the scalar product:\r
< ψn′ |ψn >=\r
Z\r
ψn′ ψndg1 . . . dg10 (18)\r
Ashtekar and collaborators have discovered and\r
emphasized again and again (see e.g.[11] ) that\r
if one considers all possible nets, then the (very\r
large) set of these states is dense in the Hilbert\r
space of gauge invariant functionals of A(β). In\r
this sense eq.(18) induces a measure DA(β)in this\r
space.\r
The gauge invariant functionals of A(β) which\r
might represent physical states are invariant\r
under diffeomorphism. Given one such state\r
Ψ[A(β)], for every spin net state ψn[A(β)] we can\r
in principle calculate its ”loop transform”:\r
Ψ(n) := Z\r
DA(β) ψn[A\r
(β)\r
] Ψ[A\r
(β)\r
] (19)\r
that will represent the same state, and is diffeo\u0002morphic invariant if it depends only on the struc\u0002ture of the net and on our assigments of spins\r
and invariant tensors. This is the latest incarna\u0002tion of the ”loop representation” idea of Rovelli\r
and Smolin[12]. This form goes particularly well\r
with the idea of the ”weave”[13]: that the world\r
that (we think) we know is likely to be described\r
by states Ψ(n) with support on huge, immensely\r
complicated and fine meshed nets, in fact with\r
mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length.\r
If we keep in mind the weave idea, it is quite\r
sensible to look at net states to find the spectrum\r
of the operators that correspond to the area of a\r
surface S and to the volume of a region R, and\r
to study the operator form of the constraints.\r
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset\r
L of lines of the net, does not touch the vertices,\r
has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the\r
operator (first taking the square root, then re\u0002moving the regulator), one finds[11,14] :\r
Aˆ(S)ψn = : Z\r
s\r
d\r
2σ\r
q\r
nanbEˆiaEˆib : ψn\r
= (β¯hκ)\r
X\r
l∈L\r
p\r
sl(sl + 1) ψn (20)\r
If the region R contains a subset V of vertices\r
of the net, one finds[14–16] by a similar proce\u0002dure that a suitably regularized volume operator\r
Vˆ (R) mixes the states ψn with coefficients pro\u0002portional to (β¯hκ)\r
3\r
2 . This operator can be diago\u0002nalized[14] , and has a complicated, but discrete\r
spectrum. Before going further, it is important\r
to notice that nothing works for the theory based\r
on the Ashtekar connection β = i: all operators\r
have the wrong hermiticity; on this, see later.\r
However, I claim that the discrete spectra one\r
gets for areas and volume cannot at this stage be

5\r
interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of\r
space, because of the arbitrariness of β; we are\r
faced with a ”β crisis”. Unless we find some good\r
reason to fix β, the commutation relations eq.(8)\r
will be unable to fix the scale of the theory. My\r
feeling is that this requires a group larger than\r
SU(2); a bit like in good old current algebra. A\r
larger group may come from the need to imple\u0002ment the ”Wick rotation”, whether interpreted as\r
a passage from the Euclidean to the Minkowskian\r
or from the Barbero to the Ashtekar connection\r
I do not know.\r
Alternatively, it may be that looking at the\r
Wheeler De Witt equation H · ˆ Ψ = 0, following\r
Thiemann’s work [9] , we shall find that solu\u0002tions exist only for particular values of β. Given\r
the way in which eq.(13) depends on β, this is\r
actually rather likely; but then, it m ay be just an\u0002other way of saying the same thing. At the same\r
time, if it were true it would be splendid: because\r
we would have derived the discreteness of space\r
from dynamics, and not from a kinematic fiddle.\r

Thiemann’s work [9] on the Hamiltonian con\u0002straint is the latest thing. It is a massive and diffi\u0002cult piece of work, so that my comments, based on\r
a very limited understanding, are obviously very\r
tentative. The main effort is aimed at defining a\r
satisfactory quantum operator corresponding to\r
HE[f], eq.(10), from which, in view of eq.(11,12)\r
the rest follows (more or less). A regularization is\r
obtained noticing that for a vertex v of a net and\r
a choice of three (outgoing) lines, say 1, 2, 3,\r
adding lines (IJ) (see the figure), in the na¨ıve\r
limit gI ≈ 1 + Aa∆a\r

This is only the beginning, the definition is sharp\u0002ened and modified several times en route. I un\u0002derstand that this summer it has been the object\r
of intensive discussions by lots of specialists at the\r
ESI workshop, and no doubt you will hear more\r
and in more detail about it.\r
4. Discretizing.\r
The pattern I have described so far occurs again\r
if you try and discretize the theory, except that\r
there are more variants: from the variable mesh\r
discretizations of the groups that solve problems\r
in the classical theory numerically (an industry in\r
rapid expansion), to emulatations of lattice gauge\r
theory or to the theory of random triangulations.\r
I shall restrict myself drastically, and try to keep\r
close in spirit to the original Regge idea.\r
Divide space in tetrahedra with a flat inside:\r
the natural variables corresponding to the Eia\r
would be the areas of the triangles, oriented out\u0002wards with respect to a frame local to the tetra\u0002hedron:\r
S := τiS\r
i\r
:= τiE\r
iaǫabc\r
1\r
2\r
(x1x2+x2x3+x3x1)\r
bc(23)\r
The area square of a triangle will be S\r
iSi\r
, and\r
of course tetrahedra must close; for the tetrahe\u0002dron A = (1234), labeling each triangle with the

6\r
number of the vertex opposite, this gives the con\u0002straint:\r
S\r
i\r
1 + S\r
i\r
2 + S\r
i\r
3 + S\r
i\r
4 = 0 (24)\r
The volume square of the tetrahedron will be :\r
V\r

The variables S must be paired with variables g\r
that link the frame attached to tetrahedron A to\r
the one of its neighbour B across the triangle,\r
with the basic condition that the triangle looks\r
the same from both sides:\r

If g is a rotation, we will discover the local ge\u0002ometry of our space going round an edge, from\r
tetrahedron to tetrahedron, until we get back:\r
then if we are not in the same frame we started\r
from, we conclude that space is curved. Changes\r
of the frames, i.e. local rotations, are ”gauge”\r
transformations, which translate eq.(5) to:\r
SA → gASAg\r
−1\r
A\r
; SB → gBS\r
−1\r
B gB\r
gAB → gAgABg\r
−1\r
B (26)\r
An explicit parametrization for the triangle (123)\r
would be :\r
SA := uA · τ3s · u\r
−1\r
A ; SB := uB · τ3s · u\r
−1\r
B\r
with : uA = e\r
ατ3 eβτ2\r
; uB := e\r
γτ3eδτ2\r
gAB := uAe\r
Φτ3 2τ2u\r
−1\r
B (27)\r
with s > 0; the angle Φ is arbitrary at this stage.\r
Suppose that we are given the lengths of all\r
edges, like in Regge’s original scheme for ”general\r
relativity without coordinates”: then we are in\r
a Riemannian space, and we have conditions for\r
the triangles that share an edge; for the edge (12)\r
they read:\r
[[S3B, S5B] , g−1\r
AB [S3A, S4A] gAB] = 0 (28)\r
I omit the details: the point is that from these\r
relations we can calculate all the angles Φ, and\r
for the curvature around the edge (12) we find:\r
RA := e\r
FA = (29)\r
= u4Ae\r
φAτ3 e(θA+θB+θC−2π)τ2 2τ2 e−φAτ3 u\r
−1\r

Curvature is essentially the ”defect angle” in the\r
rotation; the connection is Levi–Civita.\r
But what can we make of the Ki\r
a\r
? To make the\r
connection ”dynamic”, we must give up eq.(28),\r
and therefore (29), and leave the angles Φ arbi\u0002trary, because that is the only place where the ex\u0002trinsic curvature can go. Omitting details again,\r
by various plausibility arguments, and insisting\r
that in the limit eq.(8) is recovered, one finds for\r
the Liouville form Θ (the Rpdq bit of the action)\r
and for the Poisson brackets:\r
Θ = −\r

I have not tried to write the constraints for real\r
β. The idea of squeezing in dynamics by fiddling\r
Φ may appear ugly and artificial, but it is the\r
sense of the ”Barbero connection”. The Ashtekar\r
choice makes much more sense: one replaces the\r
Φ we calculated above with a complex variable:\r
Φ → Φ + iζ (32)

7\r
so that gAB is promoted to a Lorentz transforma\u0002tion, with rapidity ζ, that links the different iner\u0002tial frames attached to tetrahedra A and B. One\r
may say that this is physically well motivated,\r
and follows straight from the principle of equiva\u0002lence. However, extending the gauge transforma\u0002tions eq.(26) from SU(2) to SL(2, C) inevitably\r
creates complications: we have to impose explic\u0002itly that within a tetrahedron S\r
i\r
IS\r
i\r
J\r
is real and\r
positive definite, and eq.(28) has to be modified.\r
On the other hand we know that the Hamiltonian\r
constraint simplifies to the HE form, for which it\r
is not difficult to guess discrete versions, for ex.:\r
X\r
I<J∈T\r
1\r
VT\r
Tr([SI , SJ ]FIJ )T ≈ 0 (33)\r
in words: for each tetrahedron, the sum of the\r
lengths of the edges times the corresponding de\u0002fect angle must vanish. This comes about because\r
for the edge (12) of A we can see that\r

In practice to make any use of eq.(33), which\r
is certainly not the only expression possible, we\r
must approximate F with some function of R,\r
e.g.F ≈ (R − R−1)/2. The same or a similar\r
expression can be used for the HE part of the\r
Hamiltonian constraint for real β. It is unfortu\u0002nate that, as far as I can see, the regularized form\r
used by Thiemann is just about the least natural\r
in this scheme. This is because, at the first step\r
one finds, for ex.:\r
g4{g\r

τi(l\r

(43))\r
a rather uncooperative expression; or, said more\r
generally, because Thiemann’s tetrahedra live in\r
a lattice dual to the Regge lattice1, in which to\r
each of our triangles corresponds a line, and to\r
each tetrahedron a (4–valent) vertex.\r
1 notice that in eq.(21) the volume operator Vˆ acts on the\r
vertices of the net, that correspond to Regge tetrahedra,\r
while V(123) is the volume of a tetrahedron in the dual\r
lattice.\r
Now for quantization. At first sight, from what\r
I said about nets, it would appear that discretiza\u0002tion, and Regge calculus in particular, offers the\r
perfect tool; in fact, I became interested in Regge\r
calculus because I was trying with spin nets. Spin\r
nets naturally live in the dual of the Regge lat\u0002tice. One can immediately envisage putting on a\r
(small) computer a finite, simple lattice like a five\r
tetrahedra division of S\r
3\r
. In a real SU(2) formu\u0002lation the quantization of areas follows directly\r
from eq.(31): the area variable s is conjugate to\r
an angle Φ. This is just the way ’t Hooft ar\u0002gued in his discretized 2+1 gravity[17] , but with\r
a very refined argument to Wick-rotate the the\u0002ory. However, the direct use of the Ashtekar con\u0002nection for quantization is made impossible by a\r
muddle over the measure. I shall explain this in\r
detail because I still hope that the muddle has a\r
simple solution that I cannot see because of some\r
selective blindness.\r
One can see what the problem is quite simply\r
by writing the quantum version of eq.(30) for β =\r
i:\r
[Sˆi, Sˆj] = −κ ǫijkSˆk\r
; [ˆg, Sˆi] = −κ τi gˆ (35)\r
[ˆg\r
(1)\r
, gˆ\r
(2)] = 0 (36)\r
so that if ψ = ψ({g}), Sˆi = −κTˆi\r
L\r
, the (holomor\u0002phic) generator of the left–regular representation\r
of SL(2, C). The problem is that now there is no\r
way to juggle the measure to make Sˆi hermitean;\r
worse, Sˆ2is negative, with eigenvalues −j(j + 1).\r
Of course one did expect troubles: there are al\u0002ways troubles with non–compact groups, e.g. in\r
2+1 gravity[18], and even linearized gravity turns\r
out to be quite tricky[19]; in QED the scalar prod\u0002uct is well defined only for gauge invariant states.\r
So the cure should come from considering the\r
Hamiltonian constraint; in an interesting analy\u0002sis of the linearized case[20] the suggestion is that\r
one should gauge fix it. In our case, the idea of\r
”Wick rotation” seems much more attractive, but\r
notice that in any case it depends on solving the\r
Hamiltonian constraint.\r
The idea[10] is that one can apply to this trans\u0002formation the formalism of ”coherent state trans\u0002formations” developed by B.C. Hall[21] , suitably\r
generalized. These are isometries between Hilbert

8\r
spaces on e.g. SU(2) and on its complexification\r
SL(2, C); in the simplest case one defines heat\r
kernels on the two groups by:\r
∂ρt\r
∂t +\r
1\r
2\r
Jˆ2ρt = 0 , ρ0 = δ(x)\r
∂µt\r
∂t +\r
1\r
4\r
(Jˆ2 + Kˆ 2)µt = 0 , µ0 = δ(g) (37)\r
(notice that (Jˆ2 + Kˆ 2) is an elliptic operator, but\r
not the Casimir). Then the transformation Bt:\r
f → (Btf)(g) := Z\r
SU(2)\r
f(x)ρt(x\r
−1\r
g)dx (38)\r
maps functions on SU(2) which are L\r
2 with the\r
measure ρtdx to functions on SL(2, C) which are\r
holomorphic and L\r
2 with the measure µtdg. The\r
map can be proved to be invertible and isometric,\r
i.e.\r
Z\r
SL(2,C)\r
(Btf)(g) (Bth)(g) µt(g)dg =\r
=\r
Z\r
SU(2)\r
f(x) h(x)ρt(x)dx\r
This seems to be just what we need, but the con\u0002nection with the ”Wick rotation” is still to be\r
understood.\r

For Tullio Regge on his 65th birthday\r
This is an informal review of the formulation of canonical general relativity and of its implications for quantum\r
gravity; the various versions are compared, both in the continuum and in a discretized approximation suggested\r
by Regge calculus. I also show that the weakness of the link with the geometric content of the theory gives rise\r
to what I think is a serious flaw in the claimed derivation of a discrete structure for space at the quantum level."""

From chromodynamics, I have inherited the\r
prejudice that a decent quantum field theory\r
must have a credible discrete approximation. Be\u0002ing deep rooted, this prejudice resists counterex\u0002amples. In particular, Regge calculus [1] makes\r
the geometric content of General Relativity so\r
clear that I find difficult to believe that a suc\u0002cessful quantization scheme would not originate,\r
or translate cleanly into this discretized approxi\u0002mation. And therefore, I am reluctant to add the\r
quantization of Regge calculus to the list of coun\u0002terexamples, in spite of the modest success which\r
the various attempts have achieved [2–5], and of\r
the unquestionable fact that what progress there\r
has been has been achieved ignoring this point of\r
view.\r
I shall give a quick sketch of the recent work\r
on canonical quantization of gravity, and a ten\u0002tative critique of this work in the light of what\r
I claim Regge calculus would suggest, with side\r
comments on the meaning of the results so far\r
obtained. So, in spite of the rather generic title,\r
I shall mention only a small fraction of the work\r
going on.\r
The idea that gravity should be treated as a\r
connection theory underlies all the work I shall\r
be considering, and this is where I shall begin;\r
the other main ingredient is the idea of the ”loop\r
representation” of Rovelli and Smolin, which has\r
evolved into a theory of ”Spin nets”, and this will\r
be discussed next, with a brief summary of the\r
striking and very recent progress that has taken\r
place. Here I shall try and explain why I think\r
that these results are spoilt by the imperfect link\r
of the theory with the geometric content of gen\u0002eral relativity. The crucial importance of this link\r
will be illustrated using Regge calculus as an ex\u0002ample."""

If the aim is to formulate canonical general rel\u0002ativity as a some sort of gauge theory on 3–space,\r
we have various options[6].\r

A.D.M. start with the Einstein–Hilbert action S = 12κ R √−g R d4x, while here one starts with\r
an actionS=\r

R\r
ǫIJKLe\r
I\r
∧e\r
J\r
∧RKL (where\r
RKL is the curvature 2–form of the Levi–Civita\r
connection ΩIJ , andκ := (8πGN ewton)/c\r
3\r
), and\r
the further choice is made to partially fix the O(3, 1) gauge freedom setting: e0a = −na = N∂at (1)\r
This choice (”time gauge”) leaves invariance un\u0002der local O(3) transformations, with e\r
ia, i\r
=\r
1,2, 3 space–like to provide a local frame on the

2\r
slice. The pull–back of ΩIJ to the space slice gives\r
the 3–d L.C. connection Γi\r
a\r

2\r
q\r

, and\r
the extrinsic curvature Ki\r

b = e\r

As canonical variables we take the pair:\r

e\r
k\r
c = det(e\r

They form a canonical pair, just like the\r
(qab, πab := √\r

because EiaEib = q qab implies:\r

The Γi\r

the 9 linear equations they satisfy:\r

ia = 0 ; ǫijkEa\r

We need to impose the A.D.M. constraint, and\r
to constrain Ki\r

Everything can be rewitten in terms of 2×2 matri\u0002ces saturating i, j, . . . indices with τi\r
:= σi/(2i);\r
so for ex. the effect of local rotations becomes:\r
E\r
a\r
:= τiE\r
ia → U Ea U−1\r
Γa := τiΓ\r
i\r
a → U (Γa + ∂a)U\r
−1\r
(5)\r
There is nothing particularly new about any of\r
this; in particular Ki\r
a fits into the scheme poorly,\r
like an external field, and the connection is a de\u0002rived quantity.\r
Option (2) is a shrewd variation on the theme\r
devised by J. F. Barbero[7,6], in a re–examination\r
of the Ashtekar[8] formulation.\r
For some β to be fixed, we can change our basic\r
variables as follows:\r
(E\r
ia, Ki\r
a\r
) → (E\r
ia , A(β)i\r
a\r
:= Γi\r
a + β Kia\r
) (6)\r
which is a canonical transformation, because\r

so that:\r

j\r
δ\r
b\r
a\r
δ(x, y) (8)\r
and all other Poisson brackets vanish (in partic\u0002ular, {A\r
(β)i\r
a , A(β)j\r
b\r
} = 0). However unlike Ki\r
a\r
,\r
A\r
(β)i\r
a transforms like an SU(2) connection for any\r
β, and one can introduce D\r
(β)\r
a derivatives and\r
a curvature F\r
(β)i\r
ab . Using the properties of the\r
Levi–Civita connection and a bit of algebra the\r
constraints become:\r
D\r

ia = βGi ≈ 0\r

its derivatives.\r
Clearly the first two constraints are in an ac\u0002ceptable form, and the last one is not: the bit pro\u0002portional to (1 + β\r
2\r
) is a mess, the overall factor\r
1/\r
p\r
det(E) is unpleasant. As for this last point:\r
we either learn to live with the factor, or we ig\u0002nore it, absorbing it in the Lagrange multiplier.\r
The messy bit is more troublesome. The quick\u0002est way to get rid of it would be to take β = i.\r
This is Ashtekar’s original choice (together with\r
the idea of absorbing the factor 1/\r
p\r
det(E) in\r
the Lagrange multiplier)[8] . The point is that\r
there is much more to be said for this choice: it\r
is (or, one can convince oneself that it is) the\r
one choice that is geometrically and physically\r
well motivated. In fact the connection A\r
(i)i\r
a is\r
the pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual\r
connection, and Eia the pull–back of the self–dual\r
product of two vierbeins:\r

This definition of E\r
ia coincides with eq. (2) if\r
we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1); for the defi\u0002nition of A\r
(i)i\r
a to coincide with eq. (6) we have\r
to assume ”time gauge” and to impose explicitly

3\r
that the connection ΩIJ\r
a\r
is Levi–Civita, which fol\u0002lows if we add to the constraints the real part of\r
the second eq. (4) as a brand new ”reality” con\u0002dition. The result is, I think, physically splendid,\r
because we retain the full Lorentz group as gauge\r
group of the canonical theory, but technically ap\u0002palling, because of the obvious complications im\u0002plicit in the use of complex variables. In particu\u0002lar, the i which now occurs in the Poisson brack\u0002ets eq. (8) puts all simple minded quantizations\r
on collision course with the desire to have the\r
operators corrsponding to Eia hermitean. More\r
particularly, I have not found a way round this\r
difficulty, simple minded or not.\r
The alternative that has become most popu\u0002lar is to take β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”.\r
I would like to claim that the trouble with this\r
choice is that the connection has no obvious geo\u0002metric meaning, and that there is nothing special\r
about the value 1. In fact, β can be anything,\r
and I shall leave it arbitrary (but real > 0) in the\r
following. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the sec\u0002ond term of H is proportional to (1−β\r
2\r
), and the\r
choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”nat\u0002ural” for the (-+++) signature, but that’s not\r
saying much, unless somehow we learn to ”Wick–\r
rotate” the theory. For this possibility [6] see\r
later.\r
There are at least two smart ways out of the\r
inconvenience that Ki\r
a\r
is a complicated function\r
of A\r
(β)i\r
a and Eia (so that the expression of H\r
is messy), which come by roundabout arguments\r
devised by T. Thiemann[9]. I begin by listing\r

This is the line followed by T. Thiemann in [9],\r

A more fancy approach starts from the obser\u0002vation that the Hamiltonian evolution induced by\r

by the map:\r
WH (t)◦ f := f +t{f, H}+\r

One may say that this relation shows explicitly\r
that the value of β does not matter, since it can\r
be changed at will (which is the point I am try\u0002ing to make). More boldly, that it gives us a way\r
to go from the Barbero to the Ashtekar connec\u0002tion, setting t = iπ/2 if we had β = 1 [10,6] .\r
This idea of a ”Wick rotation” is striking, but I\r
find it very difficult to articulate. In particular,\r
I find difficult to understand how the transfor\u0002mation brings about a change of (gauge) symme\u0002try group. I nevertheless regard this as the most\r

and Smolin[12]. This form goes particularly well\r
with the idea of the ”weave”[13]: that the world\r
that (we think) we know is likely to be described\r
by states Ψ(n) with support on huge, immensely\r
complicated and fine meshed nets, in fact with\r
mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length.\r
If we keep in mind the weave idea, it is quite\r
sensible to look at net states to find the spectrum\r
of the operators that correspond to the area of a\r
surface S and to the volume of a region R, and\r
to study the operator form of the constraints.\r
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset\r
L of lines of the net, does not touch the vertices,\r
has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the\r

spectrum. Before going further, it is important\r
to notice that nothing works for the theory based\r
on the Ashtekar connection β = i: all operators\r
have the wrong hermiticity; on this, see later.\r
However, I claim that the discrete spectra one\r
gets for areas and volume cannot at this stage be

5\r
interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of\r
space, because of the arbitrariness of β; we are\r
faced with a ”β crisis”. Unless we find some good\r
reason to fix β, the commutation relations eq.(8)\r
will be unable to fix the scale of the theory. My\r
feeling is that this requires a group larger than\r

Alternatively, it may be that looking at the\r
Wheeler De Witt equation H · ˆ Ψ = 0, following\r
Thiemann’s work [9] , we shall find that solu\u0002tions exist only for particular values of β. Given\r
the way in which eq.(13) depends on β, this is\r

of the frames, i.e. local rotations, are ”gauge”\r

the triangles that share an edge; for the edge (12)\r
they read:\r
[[S3B, S5B] , g−1\r
AB [S3A, S4A] gAB] = 0 (28)\r
I omit the details: the point is that from these\r

and therefore (29), and leave the angles Φ arbi\u0002trary, because that is the only place where the ex\u0002trinsic curvature can go. Omitting details again,\r
by various plausibility arguments, and insisting\r

from eq.(31): the area variable s is conjugate to\r

worse, Sˆ2is negative, with eigenvalues −j(j + 1).\r
Of course one did expect troubles: there are al\u0002ways troubles with non–compact groups, e.g. in\r
2+1 gravity[18], and even linearized gravity turns\r
out to be quite tricky[19]; in QED the scalar prod\u0002uct is well defined only for gauge invariant states.\r

Hamiltonian constraint; in an interesting analy\u0002sis of the linearized case[20] the suggestion is that\r
