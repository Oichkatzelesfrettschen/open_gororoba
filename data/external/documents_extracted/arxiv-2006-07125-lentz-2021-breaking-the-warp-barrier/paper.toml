Abstract. Solitons in space–time capable of transporting time-like observers at\r
superluminal speeds have long been tied to violations of the weak, strong, and dominant\r
energy conditions of general relativity. The negative-energy sources required for these\r
solitons must be created through energy-intensive uncertainty principle processes as\r
no such classical source is known in particle physics. This paper overcomes this barrier\r
by constructing a class of soliton solutions that are capable of superluminal motion\r
and sourced by purely positive energy densities. The solitons are also shown to be\r
capable of being sourced from the stress-energy of a conducting plasma and classical\r
electromagnetic fields. This is the first example of hyper-fast solitons resulting from\r
known and familiar sources, reopening the discussion of superluminal mechanisms\r
rooted in conventional physics.\r
1. Introduction\r
Hyper-fast solitons within modern theories of gravity have been a topic of energetic\r
speculation in recent decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\r
One of the most prominent critiques of compact mechanisms of superluminal motion\r
within general relativity is that the geometry must largely be sourced from a form of\r
negative energy density, though there are no such known macroscopic sources in particle\r
physics. Other concerns include difficulties associated with constructing a soliton\r
from a nearly flat space–time up to the superluminal phase, where the transported\r
central observers become surrounded by a horizon, and the equal difficulties of evolving\r
from the superluminal phase back the flat space–time. Challenges associated with\r
creating horizons also include communication between inside and outside observers\r
through the soliton shell, bombardment of the inside observers by Hawking radiation,\r
and stress-energy buildup on the leading horizon. Further, creating a self-sustaining\r
Alcubierre-type superluminal soliton [1] of 100 m radius would need an immense\r
amount of (magnitude) energy, in excess of the scale that is in the visible universe,\r
Etot ∼ −6 × 1062vs/c kg mass equivalent [3], though some progress has been made in\r
arXiv:2006.07125v2 [gr-qc] 10 Aug 2020

Breaking the Warp Barrier 2\r
this area, reducing the required energy to ∼ −1030vs/c kg mass equivalent [7, 16], and\r
even down to the kilogram and gram scale [19].\r
This paper addresses the first critique by constructing a new class of hyper-fast\r
soliton solutions within general relativity that are sourced purely from positive energy\r
densities, thus removing the need for exotic negative-energy-density sources. This is\r
made possible through considering hyperbolic relations between components of the\r
space–time metric’s shift vector, which depart from the elliptic or linear relations that\r
limited solitons in the previous literature to require negative energies. Further, the\r
stress-energy sourcing these solutions fits the form of a classical electronic plasma,\r
placing superluminal phenomena into the purview of known physics. The remainder\r
of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the geometry of these novel\r
solitons using the ADM formalism [20] and produces the components of the Einstein\r
equation relevant for the class of solutions; Section 3 introduces the conditions of the\r
hyperbolically-related shift vectors and the rules for constructing a class of solutions with\r
everywhere-positive energy density and conventional energy-momentum conditions and\r
demonstrates these qualities for a family of solutions; Section 4 solves the dynamical\r
component of the geometry via the Einstein equation trace and derives requirements\r
for a potential sourcing plasma; and Section 5 discusses the consequences of discovering\r
a superluminal mechanism driven by known sources and potential avenues for future\r
study.\r
2. Solitons in General Relativity\r
The space–times considered here are decomposed in the “3+1” (ADM) formalism using\r
a similar convention to that presented in [21], or [22], specifically following the latter’s\r
sign protocol. The line element of the space–time is cast in the form\r
ds2 = −\r
\r
N\r
2 − NiNi\r
\u0001\r
dt2 − 2Nidxidt + hijdxidxj, (1)\r
where the time coordinate t stratifies space–time into space-like hypersurfaces, the space\r
metric components hij evaluated at t provide the intrinsic geometry of that hypersurface,\r
and the similarly-evaluated shift vector components Ni at t provide the coordinate three\u0002velocity of the hypersurface’s normal. The time-like unit normal one-form is therefore\r
proportional to the coordinate time element n\r
∗ = N dt, and the unit normal vector n to\r
the hypersurface has components\r

ν =\r

. (2)\r
Einstein summation notation is used throughout this paper, with Greek indices running\r
over space–time components and Latin indices over space components. The lowering\r
of Latin indices is performed using the hypersurface metric h unless otherwise stated.\r
Natural units G = c = 1 are used. Lastly, the lapse function N is set to unity.

Breaking the Warp Barrier 3\r
Central to the computation of the Einstein tensor is the hypersurface extrinsic\r
curvature, which can be written as the negative covariant derivative of the normal\r
vector field n, or in terms of coordinate derivatives as\r
Kij = −\r
1\r
2\r
\r
∂thij + N\r
k\r
∂khij + ∂iN\r
khkj + ∂jNkhki\u0001\r
. (3)\r
The solutions considered here will have hypersurfaces parameterized by flat metrics\r
under Cartesian coordinates hij = δij , reducing the extrinsic curvature expression to\r
the symmetric combination of shift vector derivatives. The trivial form of N and h\r
imply that the Eulerian observers, time-like observers whose motion in space–time is\r
normal to the hypersurfaces with four-velocity n, are in free fall.\r
Resolving the behavior of solitons within general relativity begins with a check of\r
the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions. The weak energy condition\r
is given by the projection of the Einstein equation onto the hypersurface normal\r

where the projected stress-energy is to be called the local Eulerian energy density\r
T\r
µνnµnν = N2T00 = E. (5)\r
The geometric side of the energy constraint equation is divisible into the intrinsic\r
hypersurface curvature (3)R, and the extrinsic curvature’s trace K = Ki\r

and its\r
quadratic hypersurface scalar Ki\r

The contribution of the hypersurface intrinsic curvature vanishes as the space metric h\r
is flat. The purely geometric portion of the energy condition may then be expanded in\r
terms of the shift vector components\r

Note that the last three elements of the above expression are negative definite, while\r
the first three are of indeterminant type. These first three terms have the potential\r
to provide the energy function with an island of configurations that satisfy the weak\r
energy condition. The first task of this work will be to show there exist non-flat compact\r
moving configurations that have everywhere non-negative energy.\r
The momentum conditions are implemented here by comparing the mixed\r
projection local Eulerian momentum density,\r
Ji = −nαT\r
α\r
i = NT0i\r
, (8)

Breaking the Warp Barrier 4\r
to the mixed projection of the Einstein tensor, resulting for the considered geometries\r
in the three conditions\r
8πJi = ∂jK\r
j\r
i − ∂iK. (9)\r
Both the energy and momentum conditions must be satisfied everywhere and will provide\r
a sense for the stress-energy sources needed to construct the soliton geometries.\r
The dynamics of the geometry are in general set by the remaining six free\r
components of the Einstein equation. Several of these degrees have already been made\r
moot by the choice of a flat h and constant lapse function N. The conditions for positive\r
energy solutions introduced in the next section will reduce the number of dynamical\r
geometric degrees of freedom to one, meaning that only a single component of the\r
dynamical portion of the Einstein equation is needed. The trace condition is a natural\r
choice, given by\r
8πT µ\r
µ = −R, (10)\r
where the space–time Ricci scalar decomposes in this class of space–times to\r
R = K2 + Ki\r
jK\r
j\r
i + 2LnK, (11)\r
where Ln() is the Lie derivative in the direction of the normal unit vector field.\r
3. Constructing Positive-Energy Solutions Using a Hyperbolic Shift Vector\r
Potential\r
The class of geometries studied here will be characterized by a shift vector potential\r
function, a real-valued function φ with spatial gradient relating the shift vector\r
components\r
Ni = ∂iφ. (12)\r
The soliton potentials considered here will be set to a steady state, moving with constant\r
velocity and allowing the potential to be parameterized by displacement from its moving\r
center φ(x − xs(t), y − ys(t), z − zs(t)), where ˙xs(t) = vx, ˙ys(t) = vy, and ˙zs(t) = vz are\r
the constant velocity components of the soliton.\r
The potential condition alone is insufficient to produce a positive definite function\r
of Eqn. 7, and so a relation between all the shift vector components is added. The\r
most common relations explored in the literature are linear and elliptic. Specifically,\r
the linear relation (Nx = Ny = 0) of Ref. [1] produced the renowned toroid of negative\r
energy density about the soliton bubble of Nz, here displayed in Cartesian coordinates,\r

Parabolic and hyperbolic relations remained to be explored.\r
The hyperbolic relation is examined here. Specifically, the potential function will\r
be taken to satisfy a linear wave equation over the spatial coordinates\r

where vh/\r
√\r
2 is the dimensionless wave front ‘speed’ on the hypersurface, and ρ is the\r
source function. The positive z-axis is singled out as it will be the principal direction of\r
travel for the soliton. Therefore, the remainder of this paper will consider only motion\r
along the z direction, setting vx = vy = 0. The geometric side of the energy condition\r
can then be rewritten as\r

It is still not altogether clear what the sign of the energy function is, so two\r
simplifications are applied for the purpose of demonstration. Assuming that ρ and\r
φ are both parameterized in the (x, y) coordinates by the l1 norm s = |x| + |y|, the\r
energy further can be further simplified to a two-coordinate form, here using (z, x),\r

where sign () is the sign function. One can see that the shift vector components\r
are proportional to integrals of source over the ‘past’ wave cone. Given the Green’s\r

from which rules may be formed to ensure the energy density is everywhere non-negative.\r
For instance, the energy function will be non-negative for configurations such that the

Breaking the Warp Barrier 6\r
local source density and the z-component source density gradient integrated along the\r
intersecting ‘past’ wave trajectories are of the same sign.\r
Consider the pentagonal configuration of sources in Fig. 1, illustrated via bi-lateral\r
s-projection onto the (x, 0, z) plane of a hypersurface, as a demonstration of one such\r
compact positive energy configuration with net motion vz = vs. The configuration is\r
such that the spatial wave fronts traveling from the left-most beams create a broad\r
region of high and level Nz at the center, terminating on the right-most pair of beams of\r
opposing density, with the remaining sources organized to terminate the stray branches\r
of the wave cone, Fig. 2. The net hyperbolic source of the soliton is zero. The individual\r
sources are formed as rhomboids in the 2D projection such that the boundary lines\r
are angled to be between the trajectories of the hyperbolic wavefront cone and the z\u0002constant plane for the purpose of satisfying the “non-negative energy rule” above. The\r
perpendicular components of the shift vector are seen to vanish in the central region,\r
while the parallel component over the same region is also very level but non-zero. The\r
placid region at the soliton center is nearly tidal-force-free, where Eulerian observers\r
move along essentially straight lines at vrel = Nz(0) − vo relative to the soliton. This is\r
in contrast to the volatile boundary where there exist domains in which the shift vector\r
can be much greater in size and divergent in direction. The net shift vector of the soliton\r
is found to be zero.\r
The relation between the soliton velocity is assigned to be consistent with the shift\r
vector of the soliton’s central region (vs = Nz(0, 0)) as Eulerian observers in the central\r
region will then travel along time-like curves with proper time rate matching those far\r
from the soliton, dτ = dt. In this case, the logistics of soliton travel for observers in the\r
central region reflect those in [1].\r
The energy density of the soliton is seen to be positive definite in Fig. 3. Each\r
rhomboid source ρrhom is constructed individually to have everywhere positive energy\r
density and to have positive energy density in the presence of other sources of ρrhom of\r
the same size and orientation. One can therefore piece together many other solutions\r
from these elements of hyperbolic source. The total energy requirements of the positive\u0002energy solitons closely follow that of Ref. [3] as applied to the Alcubierre solution\r
Etot =\r

to be\r

(23)\r
where C is a form factor typically of order unity. The required energy for a positive\u0002energy soliton with central regions radius R = 100 m and average source thickness along\r
the z-axis w = 1 m approaches a mass equivalent of Etot ∼ (few) × 10−1M\fvs, which is\r
of the same magnitude as the estimate of Ref. [3] for an Alcubierre solution of the same\r
dimensions, but without the uncertainties associated with where one might source the

energy. The estimate for the Alcubierre solution sourced by naturally occurring Casimir\r
forces is much higher, ∼ −6 × 1062vs kg, which requires one to reduce the boundary\r
thickness to a few hundred Planck lengths. However, no such naturality conditions are\r
known to restrict the stress-energy driving the positive energy solutions. Further, many\r
soliton solutions have been made since Ref. [1] that drastically improved on the overall\r
negative energy requirements [7, 10, 19, 16, 17]. Several of these approaches may provide\r
significant savings in energy for the positive-energy soliton.\r
The hypersurface volume expansion, calculated here from the extrinsic curvature\r
trace θ = K, can be found in Fig. 4. The volume expansion of the positive-energy soliton\r
is complex, containing expansions and contractions on all sides of the central region.\r
The solution of [1] possesses only one negative expansion lobe at the leading edge of\r
its soliton and one positive expansion lobe at the trailing edge. The largest values of\r
θ for the positive-energy soliton coincide with the sources of stress-energy density, in\r
contrast to the solution of Ref. [1] where the energy density and expansion factor are\r
maximally separated on the soliton boundary. Further, the largest positive and negative\r
lobes of θ on the positive-energy soliton are seen to correlate to the negative and positive\r
hyperbolic sources respectively. Both solutions have net expansion of 0.\r
The momentum conditions under the hyperbolic shift vector potential are seen to

an electric plasma consisting of a massive fluid and electromagnetic fields, the conditions\r
of which are investigated further in the next section.\r
4. Soliton-Plasma Dynamics\r
This section describes the conditions needed for an electrically conducting plasma to act\r
as source for the positive-energy soliton. The dynamics of the hyperbolic potential φ, or\r
equivalently the hyperbolic source ρ, can be set by the Einstein equation trace, Eqn. 10.\r

R = −16πE + 2θ\r

velocity matches the central shift vector (vs = Nz(0, 0)) has trace that is consistent with\r
a fluid with equation of state p ≤ ρ, Fig. 5, which is within the physically accepted\r
range [23].\r
In addition to supporting the energy, momentum, and trace conditions for steady\u0002state motion, the plasma must satisfy its own conditions. These include the Maxwell\r
equations for the electric and magnetic fields, the conservation and dynamical equations\r
for the massive component of the plasma, the pressure equation of state, and the\r
additional relations between the massive and electric current densities. These conditions\r
are of sufficient number to determine all the plasma’s degrees, meaning that the\r

using the dominant energy condition. The dominant energy condition is respected by\r
the sub-luminal solitons so long as the magnitude of the shift vector is less than unity\r
in all domains (NiNi < 1). For higher speeds, the soliton begins to form horizons\r

more than dozen degrees of freedom of the plasma that satisfy the example soliton, and\r

solitons, would require computation beyond the scope of this paper. What can be said\r
here is that the conditions of the plasma are consistent with the soliton geometry. It is\r
now a matter of finding the right configuration.\r
5. Conclusions\r
This paper has demonstrated that there exist superluminal solitons in general\r
relativity satisfying both the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions for\r
conventional sources of stress-energy. This is the first known solution of its kind, as\r
previous superluminal solitons have required large amounts of negative energy. The\r
positive-energy geometries presented here distinguish themselves from the literature in\r
that they obey a hyperbolic relation among their shift vector components in the form\r
of a wave equation on the associated space-like hypersurface, whereas only linear or\r
elliptic relations had been previously considered. The solitons were further constructed\r
to contain a central region with minimal tidal forces, where proper time coincides with\r
asymptotic coordinate time, and any Eulerian observer within the central region would\r
remain stationary with respect to the soliton. The transport logistics of the presented\r
positive-energy solitons are similar to the solitons of the Alcubierre solution.\r
Beyond being the first positive energy solutions of their kind, the presented solitons

Breaking the Warp Barrier 12\r
appear to be a counter example to claims in the literature that superluminal space–\r
times must violate the weak energy condition [6, 13]. To contrast the present positive\u0002energy soliton and the previous proofs, one must realize that the pre-conditions of\r
these proofs are restricted to geometries with a single fastest causal path. No known\r
generalizations of the proofs exist to extensive superluminal mechanisms. Previous\r
superluminal solitons such as the Alcubierre and Nat´ario solutions can be made to\r
fit this condition as their structures permit a point-like limit of the interior, where\r
the fastest causal path would settle. The example positive-energy, in contrast, must\r
have non-trivial extent. Similar point-like limits of the positive energy solitons would\r
collapse the geometry to the Minkowski vacuum, an expected outcome as the shift vector\r
components are seen to integrate to zero. The positive energy soliton therefore appears\r
to circumvent the criteria of [6] and [13].\r
The energy and momentum conditions of the presented positive-energy geometries\r
were found to conform to a plasma with no net momentum flux. The trace of the\r
Einstein equation, the single dynamical conditions that determines the hyperbolic shift\r
vector potential, was used to determine the limits on the plasma equation of state\r
in lieu of having already set the steady-state velocity of the soliton. The geometric\r
conditions on the plasma are deferential to the plasma’s own dynamical equations,\r
which include equations of motion and constitutive relations for both the massive fluid\r
and the electromagnetic fields. The total energy requirements of the positive-energy\r
solitons appear to be of the same order as the original Alcubierre soliton under the\r
same shell-thickness-to-diameter conditions, with the energy for a soliton of modest\r
radius R = 100 m and shell thickness w = 1 m requiring Etot ∼ (few) × 10−1M\fvs/c.\r
This energy, though still immense, is intriguing as there have been many advances in\r
reducing the required energy of the negative-energy solitons that may be equally effective\r
for this new class of solutions. The next challenge is to bring the energy requirements\r
of the positive-energy soliton to the human technological scale.\r
Once the energy requirement is lowered, the space–time signatures of positive\u0002energy solitons may be studied in a laboratory setting using existing or novel methods.\r
For instance, previous interferometric searches for hyperfast solitons could be recast\r
to search for the much larger signal of a positive-energy-efficient soliton [17, 24]. The\r
highly magnetized energetic and diffuse atmospheric plasma of magnetars may also be\r
a natural place to look for signatures of positive-energy soliton geometries even prior to\r
advances in energy reduction.\r
For theory, it is an appealing proposition to incorporate the degrees and dynamics\r
of the plasma into the geometric computation. One could self-consistently simulate\r
the creation, propagation, and dismantlement phases of a soliton at both sub- and\r
superluminal speeds. Other directions include further optimizations of the solutions over\r
the energy requirements and other trade-offs, the broadening of the soliton geometry\r
to incorporate a “payload” in the soliton’s central region, and studying the challenges\r
of horizon formation when transitioning to superluminal speeds. However, developing\r
models and configurations of the plasma alongside the geometry would in general require

Breaking the Warp Barrier 13\r
a large-scale numerical effort. Fortunately, in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy\r
and high-precision cosmology, there exist a number of numerical relativity codes that are\r
increasingly capable of describing massive fluids and gauge fields in relativistic space–\r
time.\r

Abstract. Solitons in space–time capable of transporting time-like observers at\r
superluminal speeds have long been tied to violations of the weak, strong, and dominant\r
energy conditions of general relativity. The negative-energy sources required for these\r
solitons must be created through energy-intensive uncertainty principle processes as\r
no such classical source is known in particle physics. This paper overcomes this barrier\r
by constructing a class of soliton solutions that are capable of superluminal motion\r
and sourced by purely positive energy densities. The solitons are also shown to be\r
capable of being sourced from the stress-energy of a conducting plasma and classical\r
electromagnetic fields. This is the first example of hyper-fast solitons resulting from\r
known and familiar sources, reopening the discussion of superluminal mechanisms\r
rooted in conventional physics."""

Hyper-fast solitons within modern theories of gravity have been a topic of energetic\r
speculation in recent decades [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].\r
One of the most prominent critiques of compact mechanisms of superluminal motion\r
within general relativity is that the geometry must largely be sourced from a form of\r
negative energy density, though there are no such known macroscopic sources in particle\r
physics. Other concerns include difficulties associated with constructing a soliton\r
from a nearly flat space–time up to the superluminal phase, where the transported\r
central observers become surrounded by a horizon, and the equal difficulties of evolving\r
from the superluminal phase back the flat space–time. Challenges associated with\r
creating horizons also include communication between inside and outside observers\r
through the soliton shell, bombardment of the inside observers by Hawking radiation,\r
and stress-energy buildup on the leading horizon. Further, creating a self-sustaining\r
Alcubierre-type superluminal soliton [1] of 100 m radius would need an immense\r
amount of (magnitude) energy, in excess of the scale that is in the visible universe,\r

Breaking the Warp Barrier 2\r
this area, reducing the required energy to ∼ −1030vs/c kg mass equivalent [7, 16], and\r
even down to the kilogram and gram scale [19].\r
This paper addresses the first critique by constructing a new class of hyper-fast\r
soliton solutions within general relativity that are sourced purely from positive energy\r
densities, thus removing the need for exotic negative-energy-density sources. This is\r
made possible through considering hyperbolic relations between components of the\r
space–time metric’s shift vector, which depart from the elliptic or linear relations that\r
limited solitons in the previous literature to require negative energies. Further, the\r
stress-energy sourcing these solutions fits the form of a classical electronic plasma,\r
placing superluminal phenomena into the purview of known physics. The remainder\r
of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the geometry of these novel\r
solitons using the ADM formalism [20] and produces the components of the Einstein\r
equation relevant for the class of solutions; Section 3 introduces the conditions of the\r
hyperbolically-related shift vectors and the rules for constructing a class of solutions with\r
everywhere-positive energy density and conventional energy-momentum conditions and\r
demonstrates these qualities for a family of solutions; Section 4 solves the dynamical\r
component of the geometry via the Einstein equation trace and derives requirements\r
for a potential sourcing plasma; and Section 5 discusses the consequences of discovering\r
a superluminal mechanism driven by known sources and potential avenues for future\r
study."""

The space–times considered here are decomposed in the “3+1” (ADM) formalism using\r
a similar convention to that presented in [21], or [22], specifically following the latter’s\r
sign protocol. The line element of the space–time is cast in the form\r
ds2 = −\r

where the time coordinate t stratifies space–time into space-like hypersurfaces, the space\r
metric components hij evaluated at t provide the intrinsic geometry of that hypersurface,\r
and the similarly-evaluated shift vector components Ni at t provide the coordinate three\u0002velocity of the hypersurface’s normal. The time-like unit normal one-form is therefore\r
proportional to the coordinate time element n\r

Einstein summation notation is used throughout this paper, with Greek indices running\r
over space–time components and Latin indices over space components. The lowering\r
of Latin indices is performed using the hypersurface metric h unless otherwise stated.\r
Natural units G = c = 1 are used. Lastly, the lapse function N is set to unity.

Central to the computation of the Einstein tensor is the hypersurface extrinsic\r
curvature, which can be written as the negative covariant derivative of the normal\r
vector field n, or in terms of coordinate derivatives as\r

The solutions considered here will have hypersurfaces parameterized by flat metrics\r
under Cartesian coordinates hij = δij , reducing the extrinsic curvature expression to\r
the symmetric combination of shift vector derivatives. The trivial form of N and h\r
imply that the Eulerian observers, time-like observers whose motion in space–time is\r
normal to the hypersurfaces with four-velocity n, are in free fall.\r
Resolving the behavior of solitons within general relativity begins with a check of\r
the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions. The weak energy condition\r
is given by the projection of the Einstein equation onto the hypersurface normal\r

Note that the last three elements of the above expression are negative definite, while\r
the first three are of indeterminant type. These first three terms have the potential\r
to provide the energy function with an island of configurations that satisfy the weak\r

moving configurations that have everywhere non-negative energy.\r

The dynamics of the geometry are in general set by the remaining six free\r
components of the Einstein equation. Several of these degrees have already been made\r
moot by the choice of a flat h and constant lapse function N. The conditions for positive\r
energy solutions introduced in the next section will reduce the number of dynamical\r
geometric degrees of freedom to one, meaning that only a single component of the\r
dynamical portion of the Einstein equation is needed. The trace condition is a natural\r

The soliton potentials considered here will be set to a steady state, moving with constant\r
velocity and allowing the potential to be parameterized by displacement from its moving\r

The potential condition alone is insufficient to produce a positive definite function\r
of Eqn. 7, and so a relation between all the shift vector components is added. The\r
most common relations explored in the literature are linear and elliptic. Specifically,\r

s-projection onto the (x, 0, z) plane of a hypersurface, as a demonstration of one such\r
compact positive energy configuration with net motion vz = vs. The configuration is\r
such that the spatial wave fronts traveling from the left-most beams create a broad\r
region of high and level Nz at the center, terminating on the right-most pair of beams of\r
opposing density, with the remaining sources organized to terminate the stray branches\r
of the wave cone, Fig. 2. The net hyperbolic source of the soliton is zero. The individual\r
sources are formed as rhomboids in the 2D projection such that the boundary lines\r
are angled to be between the trajectories of the hyperbolic wavefront cone and the z\u0002constant plane for the purpose of satisfying the “non-negative energy rule” above. The\r
perpendicular components of the shift vector are seen to vanish in the central region,\r
while the parallel component over the same region is also very level but non-zero. The\r
placid region at the soliton center is nearly tidal-force-free, where Eulerian observers\r
move along essentially straight lines at vrel = Nz(0) − vo relative to the soliton. This is\r
in contrast to the volatile boundary where there exist domains in which the shift vector\r
can be much greater in size and divergent in direction. The net shift vector of the soliton\r
is found to be zero.\r
The relation between the soliton velocity is assigned to be consistent with the shift\r
vector of the soliton’s central region (vs = Nz(0, 0)) as Eulerian observers in the central\r
region will then travel along time-like curves with proper time rate matching those far\r
from the soliton, dτ = dt. In this case, the logistics of soliton travel for observers in the\r
central region reflect those in [1].\r
The energy density of the soliton is seen to be positive definite in Fig. 3. Each\r
rhomboid source ρrhom is constructed individually to have everywhere positive energy\r
density and to have positive energy density in the presence of other sources of ρrhom of\r
the same size and orientation. One can therefore piece together many other solutions\r
from these elements of hyperbolic source. The total energy requirements of the positive\u0002energy solitons closely follow that of Ref. [3] as applied to the Alcubierre solution\r

of the same magnitude as the estimate of Ref. [3] for an Alcubierre solution of the same\r
dimensions, but without the uncertainties associated with where one might source the

forces is much higher, ∼ −6 × 1062vs kg, which requires one to reduce the boundary\r
thickness to a few hundred Planck lengths. However, no such naturality conditions are\r
known to restrict the stress-energy driving the positive energy solutions. Further, many\r
soliton solutions have been made since Ref. [1] that drastically improved on the overall\r
negative energy requirements [7, 10, 19, 16, 17]. Several of these approaches may provide\r
significant savings in energy for the positive-energy soliton.\r
The hypersurface volume expansion, calculated here from the extrinsic curvature\r
trace θ = K, can be found in Fig. 4. The volume expansion of the positive-energy soliton\r
is complex, containing expansions and contractions on all sides of the central region.\r
The solution of [1] possesses only one negative expansion lobe at the leading edge of\r
its soliton and one positive expansion lobe at the trailing edge. The largest values of\r
θ for the positive-energy soliton coincide with the sources of stress-energy density, in\r
contrast to the solution of Ref. [1] where the energy density and expansion factor are\r
maximally separated on the soliton boundary. Further, the largest positive and negative\r
lobes of θ on the positive-energy soliton are seen to correlate to the negative and positive\r
hyperbolic sources respectively. Both solutions have net expansion of 0.\r
The momentum conditions under the hyperbolic shift vector potential are seen to

This paper has demonstrated that there exist superluminal solitons in general\r
relativity satisfying both the weak energy condition and the momentum conditions for\r
conventional sources of stress-energy. This is the first known solution of its kind, as\r
previous superluminal solitons have required large amounts of negative energy. The\r
positive-energy geometries presented here distinguish themselves from the literature in\r
that they obey a hyperbolic relation among their shift vector components in the form\r
of a wave equation on the associated space-like hypersurface, whereas only linear or\r
elliptic relations had been previously considered. The solitons were further constructed\r
to contain a central region with minimal tidal forces, where proper time coincides with\r
asymptotic coordinate time, and any Eulerian observer within the central region would\r
remain stationary with respect to the soliton. The transport logistics of the presented\r
positive-energy solitons are similar to the solitons of the Alcubierre solution.\r
Beyond being the first positive energy solutions of their kind, the presented solitons

Breaking the Warp Barrier 12\r
appear to be a counter example to claims in the literature that superluminal space–\r
times must violate the weak energy condition [6, 13]. To contrast the present positive\u0002energy soliton and the previous proofs, one must realize that the pre-conditions of\r
these proofs are restricted to geometries with a single fastest causal path. No known\r
generalizations of the proofs exist to extensive superluminal mechanisms. Previous\r
superluminal solitons such as the Alcubierre and Nat´ario solutions can be made to\r
fit this condition as their structures permit a point-like limit of the interior, where\r
the fastest causal path would settle. The example positive-energy, in contrast, must\r
have non-trivial extent. Similar point-like limits of the positive energy solitons would\r
collapse the geometry to the Minkowski vacuum, an expected outcome as the shift vector\r
components are seen to integrate to zero. The positive energy soliton therefore appears\r
to circumvent the criteria of [6] and [13].\r
The energy and momentum conditions of the presented positive-energy geometries\r
were found to conform to a plasma with no net momentum flux. The trace of the\r
Einstein equation, the single dynamical conditions that determines the hyperbolic shift\r
vector potential, was used to determine the limits on the plasma equation of state\r
in lieu of having already set the steady-state velocity of the soliton. The geometric\r
conditions on the plasma are deferential to the plasma’s own dynamical equations,\r
which include equations of motion and constitutive relations for both the massive fluid\r
and the electromagnetic fields. The total energy requirements of the positive-energy\r
solitons appear to be of the same order as the original Alcubierre soliton under the\r
same shell-thickness-to-diameter conditions, with the energy for a soliton of modest\r
radius R = 100 m and shell thickness w = 1 m requiring Etot ∼ (few) × 10−1M\fvs/c.\r
This energy, though still immense, is intriguing as there have been many advances in\r
reducing the required energy of the negative-energy solitons that may be equally effective\r
for this new class of solutions. The next challenge is to bring the energy requirements\r
of the positive-energy soliton to the human technological scale.\r
Once the energy requirement is lowered, the space–time signatures of positive\u0002energy solitons may be studied in a laboratory setting using existing or novel methods.\r
For instance, previous interferometric searches for hyperfast solitons could be recast\r
to search for the much larger signal of a positive-energy-efficient soliton [17, 24]. The\r
highly magnetized energetic and diffuse atmospheric plasma of magnetars may also be\r
a natural place to look for signatures of positive-energy soliton geometries even prior to\r
advances in energy reduction.\r
For theory, it is an appealing proposition to incorporate the degrees and dynamics\r
of the plasma into the geometric computation. One could self-consistently simulate\r
the creation, propagation, and dismantlement phases of a soliton at both sub- and\r
superluminal speeds. Other directions include further optimizations of the solutions over\r
the energy requirements and other trade-offs, the broadening of the soliton geometry\r
to incorporate a “payload” in the soliton’s central region, and studying the challenges\r
of horizon formation when transitioning to superluminal speeds. However, developing\r
models and configurations of the plasma alongside the geometry would in general require

Breaking the Warp Barrier 13\r
a large-scale numerical effort. Fortunately, in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy\r
and high-precision cosmology, there exist a number of numerical relativity codes that are\r
increasingly capable of describing massive fluids and gauge fields in relativistic space–\r
time."""
