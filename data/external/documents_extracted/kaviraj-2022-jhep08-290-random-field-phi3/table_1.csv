not preserved, along the RG flow we may also find superfields which transform in nontrivial representations Oa1...a` of OSp(d,2), where we use the notation of [8] and define
latin OSp(d,2) tensor indices as ai = 1, . . . , d, θ, ¯θ. Indeed we can be obtain singlets of
SO(d) × Sp(2) by contracting the OSp(d,2) indices of the superfields with the Sp(2)-metric,
