Abstract While conducting analysis related to a DARPA\u0002funded project to evaluate possible structure of the energy\r
density present in a Casimir cavity as predicted by the\r
dynamic vacuum model, a micro/nano-scale structure has\r
been discovered that predicts negative energy density distri\u0002bution that closely matches requirements for the Alcubierre\r
metric. The simplest notional geometry being analyzed as\r
part of the DARPA-funded work consists of a standard par\u0002allel plate Casimir cavity equipped with pillars arrayed along\r
the cavity mid-plane with the purpose of detecting a transient\r
electric field arising from vacuum polarization conjectured to\r
occur along the midplane of the cavity. An analytic technique\r
called worldline numerics was adapted to numerically assess\r
vacuum response to the custom Casimir cavity, and these\r
numerical analysis results were observed to be qualitatively\r
quite similar to a two-dimensional representation of energy\r
density requirements for the Alcubierre warp metric. Subse\u0002quently, a toy model consisting of a 1 µm diameter sphere\r
centrally located in a 4µm diameter cylinder was analyzed to\r
show a three-dimensional Casimir energy density that corre\u0002lates well with the Alcubierre warp metric requirements. This\r
qualitative correlation would suggest that chip-scale experi\u0002ments might be explored to attempt to measure tiny signatures\r
illustrative of the presence of the conjectured phenomenon:\r
a real, albeit humble, warp bubble.\r

the possibility of structure to the Casimir energy distribu\u0002tion manifested in a parallel plate cavity. The dynamic vac\u0002uum model predicts that the negative vacuum energy density\r
present in the parallel plate cavity is not isotropic, rather\r
there is a varying energy density field present in the cavity\r
with an average value that corresponds with that predicted\r
by the traditional equation for parallel-plate Casimir energy\r
density. The structure predicted to be manifest in the cav\u0002ity takes the form of a larger magnitude negative vacuum\r
energy density concentrated along the cavity mid-plane that\r
relaxes non-linearly to the unperturbed state at the cavity\r
boundaries. Based on detailed studies of the atomic orbitals\r
of the hydrogen atom, and deriving the acoustic wave equa\u0002tion from the Schrödinger equation [1,2], it is speculated that\r
the energy density structure in a Casimir cavity is coupled to\r
a small polarization field in the vacuum fluctuations resulting\r
in a small but non-zero electrostatic field originating along\r
the cavity mid-plane and terminating at the grounded cav\u0002ity walls. It has been further reasoned in the literature that\r
it may be possible to construct a customized Casimir cav\u0002ity equipped with small pillars placed at the mid-plane as\r
depicted in Fig. 1 such that when the pillar channel is sampled\r
by a high impedance oscilloscope, the scope would detect a\r
transient non-zero voltage signal2 that would rapidly go to\r
zero as the stored energy in the polarization field is depleted\r
from the measurement process [4].\r
2 A recently published paper [3] details an experimental campaign\r
using an asymmetric Casimir cavity arrangement where one cavity has\r
a small separation and the other cavity has a much larger effective sep\u0002aration. This experimental campaign observed a current flow from the\r
larger cavity electrode to the smaller cavity electrode. Our cavity is\r
analogous in that the two parallel plates define a large cavity and the\r
plate-pillar system plays the role of the smaller cavity.\r

Fig. 1 Parallel plate cavity design with pillar-like features along the\r
mid-plane – the dynamic vacuum model predicts that the scope will\r
measure a small but non-zero transient voltage pulse from the pillars\r
once connected to the cavities as shown. The anticipated geometry of\r
each cavity is approximately 4 µm wide with each plate measuring\r
40 µm by 40 µm. The pillars are expected to be approximately 1 µm\r
in diameter\r
If these cavities can be made small enough and arrayed\r
together in large enough numbers to increase the stored\r
energy, the magnitude and duration of this predicted tran\u0002sient voltage signal may be detectable in a laboratory set\u0002ting. The equation that predicts the magnitude of this small\r
but non-zero electrostatic field was derived in [4] and takes\r
the following form: E = \u0002\u0002cπ2\r
/1080\u00030d4. A quick calculation\r
for a Casimir cavity with a 4 µm gap predicts a magnitude\r
of the electrostatic potential arising from the polarization\r
of the vacuum fluctuations along the mid-plane of the cav\u0002ity to be ∼ 0.7 mV. Figure 2 shows some examples of the\r
current nanofabrication trian runs that are ongoing as part\r
of the effort. The left panel in the figure depicts a recent\r
result obtained utilizing a Nanoscribe 3d printer to evaluate\r
a range of cavity gaps and pillar sizes. The material being\r
used in the manufacture is SU-8 2025 permanent epoxy neg\u0002ative photoresist. After printing and curing, the cavities then\r
undergo electroless plating to add a layer of Ag to the outer\r
surfaces. The right panel shows recent etching results using\r
Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) equipment to etch the\r
high-aspect ratio cavity planes into a silicon wafer substrate.\r
This approach uses standard SiO2 wafer materials with the\r
expectation that the final concepts will have a metallic layer\r
added by means of evaporation. The results depicted were\r
focused on achieving the high-aspect ratio etch, and future\r
work will incorporate the masking necessary to produce pil\u0002lars. A technical concern with the proposed design imple\u0002mentation is how the presence of pillars might affect the pre\u0002dicted Casimir energy density distribution within the cavity\r
- would there be self-screening that occurs within the pillar\r

the detectable signal? It was during the analysis process seek\u0002ing to address this screening question that an unanticipated\r
intersection with the Alcubierre metric was found.\r
2 Introduction\r
The literature search phase of this DARPA project discovered\r
a numerical methods approach known as worldline numerics\r
[5–9] that can be used to study and quantify the Casimir\r
energy density and force. The curious aspect of this modeling\r
approach that makes it of high interest to the DARPA project\r
is that it predicts that there is structure (spatial variation)\r
to the negative vacuum energy density in a Casimir cavity\r
analogous to the predictions of the dynamic vacuum model.\r
The primary value of considering an implementation of this\r
model technique is that it provides a high fidelity prediction\r
of the perturbed vacuum state insidemodel geometry (e.g. the\r
evanescent fields in structure) along with predictions for the\r
perturbed vacuum state within the cavity gaps. An additional\r
benefit of the worldline numerics method3 for studying the\r
Casimir effect is that it can be used to address any type of\r
geometry with effectively no restrictions on curvature or lack\r
of smoothness.\r
Due to the similarities with the dynamic vacuum model\r
and its computational flexibility coupled with maturity, this\r
worldline numerics technique has been implemented to con\u0002sider the custom Casimir cavities and determine the predicted\r
negative vacuum energy density distribution in the cavities\r
and within the pillars. Figure 3 depicts the numerical analysis\r
results from our implementation of the worldline approach\r

Fig. 3 Panel (a) shows a 2 dimensional section cut of a sphere-plate\r
case using the numerical worldline technique. The approach was imple\u0002mented using Open MPI-enabled c-code and the analysis was run on\r
100 2.40 GHz Intel Skylake CPUs. The model grid was a 50 × 50 × 50\r
grid with a 2000 unit-loop ensemble. The bottom plot shows a vector\r
plot of forces normal to model surfaces and was created by importing\r
the worldline numerics results into COMSOL\r
considering a 3 dimensional sphere with a radius of 4 µm\r
separated from an infinite flat plate by a separation of 4 µm.\r

unit-loop ensemble. The top panel shows a 2 dimensional sec\u0002tion cut of the predicted distribution to the negative vacuum\r

be noted that the field gradients extend into both the body of\r
the sphere and the flat plate in the form of evanescent fields.\r
The bottom panel shows the distribution of forces across the\r

The following section provides a brief summary of the details\r
behind the worldline numerics analytic approach.\r
3 Synopsis of Casimir worldline numerics\r
The string theory inspired worldline numerics approach to\r
determine the Casimir effect is developed in detail in [5],\r
and the critical aspects of the analysis technique are briefly\r
summarized here for convenience. With the objective of eval\u0002uating the Casimir interaction energy ECasimir (e.g. normal\u0002ized) arising from the coupling of a real scalar quantum field\r
φ of finite mass m with a background potential V(x)that rep\u0002resents the Casimir geometry, the key equation from Section\r
2.1 of [5] is the effective action shown in Eq. (1).\r

where the following “Wilson loop” identity has been intro\u0002duced with y representing the (unit) loop path4, x represent\u0002ing the position shift of the unit loop in model space, and T\r

Equipped with this information, one can calculate the\r
(unrenormalized) Casimir energy as E = Γ / \b dx0 where\r
the integral represents the “volume” in the time direction.\r
When considering the Casimir force, the portion of the\r
Casimir energy that has a dependency on the relative posi\u0002tions of the bounding geometries can be obtained by subtract\u0002ing the energies of the single objects from the total Casimir\r
energy.\r

The Casimir force can be obtained by taking the negative\r
spatial derivative of this interaction energy, and further, this\r
process has removed any UV divergences. In the Dirichlet\r
limit λ → ∞ and for a massless scalar field with Dirichlet\r
boundaries in D = 3+1, the worldline representation of the\r
Casimir interaction energy boils down to5:\r

The worldline functional \bΣ[x(τ )] = 0 if the re-scaled\r
unit loop does not intersect any Casimir geometry and\r
\bΣ[x(τ )] = 1 − n if the re-scaled loop intersects n ≥ 1\r
Casimir geometry. The numerical evaluation process requires\r
two discretization steps. The first is the discretization of the\r
path integral into an ensemble of nL random paths x\u000B(τ ),\r
\u000B = 1,..., nL with each path forming a closed spacetime\r
loop. The second is the discretization of the proper time inter\u0002val τ ∈ [0, T ] into N steps such that an individual closed\r
loop consists of N points per loop: x\u000Bk :=x\u000B(k · T/N), k =\r
1,... N. Transporting and rescaling the ensemble of unit\r
loops to a point xCM in the model takes the following form:\r
x\u000Bk = xCM + √T y\u000Bk . Applying these two discretizations to\r
the Casimir interaction energy in Eq. (5) yields the following\r

As the worldline numeric approach for the Casimir phe\u0002nomenon is based on (massless) scalar fields, the technique\r
can currently only assess idealized behaviour for bounding\r
geometry and cannot assess any frequency dependence of\r
materials. Additionally, the approach developed to date in\r
the literature does not account for the impacts of temperature.\r
However, it is still a very capable and appealing technique in\r
that it can provide quick and fairly accurate assessments for\r
very complicated geometries where analytic techniques are\r
not practical.\r
3.1 Generating unit loops, computational approach, and\r
implementation validation\r
The developers of the worldline numerics for the Casimir\r
phenomenon explored numerous ways [5] to generate ensem\u0002bles of unit loops with Gaussian distribution ranging from a\r
heat bath kernel to random walks, and finally landing on a\r
technique denoted as the “v-loop” algorithm. The curious\r

Section 3.2 of [8].\r

Fig. 4 Gaussian distributed closed unit loops representative of scalar\r
field fluctuation generated using v-loop methodology. Algorithm will\r
generate ensemble of nL unit loops to be scaled and applied at each\r
geometric point of interest in a physical model\r
reader is encouraged to review the referenced manuscript for\r
a thorough discussion of the benefits and shortfalls of the\r
different techniques explored. The “v-loop” technique was\r
selected as it can computationally generate an ensemble of\r
nL each having N points per loop without having to perform\r
multiple iterations on each loop to realize a closed random\r
walk/worldline with the required statistical characteristics.\r
Figure 4 shows several examples of unit-loops generated by\r
the v-loop methodology ranging from a 100 point unit loop\r
to a 5000 point unit loop. A summary of the computational\r
procedure steps are provided here to facilitate the reader’s\r
understanding of the “v-loop” approach:\r
1. generate N − 1 numbers wi (i = 1,..., N − 1) with\r
a Gaussian distribution e−w2\r
i (e.g. using Box–Müller\r
method);\r
2. calculate N − 1 numbers v¯i by normalizing wi :\r

3. calculate vi for i = 2,..., N − 1 with the following:\r

where vi−1,1 = \t\r

5. this procedure is repeated nL times to create the unit loop\r
ensemble y\u000B with \u000B = 1,..., nL.\r
The benefit of this numeric worldline approach is that it\r
can be used to address any type of geometry while other\r
approaches such as Proximity-Force Approximation (PFA)\r
are not as flexible. Additionally, the approach has no depen\u0002dency on the choice of model grid spacing or grid choice.\r
The answer for a single point of interest in space does not\r
have any interdependency on any other model grid points and\r
may be calculated in total isolation if that is all that is needed.\r
Figure 56 provides a pictoral representation of the analysis\r
process for a parallel plate Casimir cavity. As indicated in\r
the figure, once the loop ensemble has been generated the\r
computational process to calculate the Casimir interaction\r
energy follows the below enumerated steps:\r
1. The loop ensemble is moved to each model grid point of\r
interest and scaled using proper time until 2+ bodies in\r
the model are pierced;\r
2. the scale at which an individual loop pierces 2+ bod\u0002ies defines the integral limits for the Casimir interaction\r
energy integral;\r
3. the energy at the geometric point of interest in the model\r
is increased based on wavelength (loop scale) and loop\r
weight factor;\r
4. this scaling process is repeated for each loop in the ensem\u0002ble at a geometric point of interest in the model;\r
5. the above steps are repeated for each geometric point of\r
interest in the model.\r
6 While the figure depicts a regularized model grid for communication\r
purposes, the computational result at an individual model point is not\r
dependent on adjacent points making the technique independent of grid\r
choice.\r
Validation of our implementation of the numeric worldline\r
approach was done on a plate-plate case and a corresponding\r
plate-sphere case and was compared to documented results\r
in the literature [5]. For the reader’s awareness, the work doc\u0002umented in [5] conducts extensive analysis to compare ana\u0002lytic results to the numeric results produced by the worldline\r
technique for the simple plate-plate scenario and plate-sphere\r
scenario. The referenced study explored the impact of num\u0002ber of points per unit loop, number of unit loops in an ensem\u0002ble, separation distance of geometries, coupling, and mass. It\r
is not the intention of this paper to duplicate the viability of\r
the overall worldline numerics approach as this has already\r
been done in the literature as noted, rather the intention of this\r
paper is to apply this very powerful and flexible technique to\r
fairly complicated geometries where only numerical methods\r
can effectively be used. In our validation effort, we confirmed\r
that our model predict the correct Casimir force for a given\r
plate-plate or sphere place scenario, and subsequently com\u0002pared their Casimir interaction energy density results from\r
their numeric worldline algorithm to our interaction energy\r
density results from our numeric worldline algorithm. The\r
subsequent more complicated geometries we consider forth\u0002with as part of this work do not have trivial analytic solutions\r
which is why the numeric worldline technique is employed.\r
A plot of the results from our implementation is provided\r
in Fig. 6 for the two cases and the plot also includes a plate\u0002blade case. The geometry of all three cases is such that the\r
closest point of separation between all three cases is iden\u0002tical allowing for comparison of the results to evaluate the\r
effects of curvature. The plots reflect the energy density as\r
measured along a line normal to the plate-plate geometry\r
and these geometric points of interest are the same for the\r
plate-sphere and plate-blade cases. The colors of the Casimir\r
energy density plots correspond to the colors of the toy geom\u0002etry also overlayed on the plot facilitating comparison of the\r
results and to clearly see the impact of curvature. Comparing\r
our results to those in literature indicates that our algorithms\r
are functioning properly.\r
4 Analysis results and unanticipated findings\r
As discussed in the opening of the manuscript, the critical\r
concern for this project is if the presence of a pillar in the\r
Casimir cavity would serve to screen itself in such a way that\r
it would be unable to see the negative vacuum energy density\r
gradient predicted to be present in the cavity if the pillars were\r
not present. A model was built to assess a 4 µm cavity with\r
a 1 µm diameter pillar placed in the middle of the cavity.\r
The model discretization was a 35×35 grid running ± 4 µm\r
in both the x and y axis. The x-axis is the vector normal to\r
the parallel cavity plates, and the y-axis is orthogonal to the\r
x-axis and defines the 2D surface for the energy density plot.\r

loop that sets the integral limits for\r

increased by a loop-weighted amount\r
(a) transporting unit loop ensemble to geometric point of interest\r
(b) scaling of an individual loop of the ensemble so that it inter\u0002sects 2+ bodies of the model\r
The origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the\r
pillar. The analysis results are shown in Fig. 7 with a two\r
dimensional representation of the energy density depicted in\r
the left panel and a log of the energy density levels in the right\r
panel. Inspecting the log-plot on the right shows that while\r
the presence of the pillar in the cavity does perturb the field,\r
it actually serves to slightly increase the effective negative\r
vacuum energy density seen in the pillar by a factor of 3–\r
5 compared to the density level present without the pillar in\r
the cavity. These analysis results would suggest that the pillar\r
does not adversely self-screen itself in a manner that prevents\r
it from seeing the field magnitude in the cavity with no pillar\r
present. Rather, due to the slightly elevated state, it could\r
be reasoned that the pillar seems to focus the gradient in a\r
manner that would at most allow the pillar to drain the stored\r
energy in the cavity at a quicker rate once it is connected to\r
a high impedance oscilloscope.This effect might result in a\r
need for more cavities to provide enough stored energy such\r
that the duration of the transient voltage signal will last long\r
enough for detection.\r
While the analysis results discussed above are encourag\u0002ing for the project objective of attempting to measure the\r
presence of structure in the negative vacuum energy density\r
within a customized Casimir cavity, the implications of this\r
particular predicted negative vacuum energy density distri\u0002bution is quite intriguing for an altogether different reason.\r
As it so happens, the structure of the field around the pillar\r
in the two dimensional plot is qualitatively very similar to\r
a plot of the negative vacuum energy density necessary for\r
the Alcubierre warp metric.7 Figure 9 shows a zoomed view\r
on the numeric worldline analysis of the plate-pillar case on\r

to exotic matter for the idea of a wormhole in [11,12] and later expanded\r
on in a book[13] on wormholes by Visser. It was also identified by\r
Alcubierre[14] in his seminal paper as an alternative source to exotic\r
matter for the manifestation of a warp bubble. The Casimir phenomenon\r

The plot also includes a plate-blade case. The geometry elements are\r
represented by a thick vertical black line for the left Casimir cavity\r
plate, a thick vertical cyan line for the right plate, a thick gray quarter\r
circle to show the location of the sphere, and an orange horizontal\r
line representing the blade. The colors of the plots of energy density\r
distribution match the color of the corresponding geometry overlayed in\r
the plot. The magnitude of the energy density distribution clearly shows\r
a decrease in magnitude as the cases go from plate-plate to plate-blade.\r
Additionally, the plots show that there is a shifting of the peaks to the\r
right due to the curvature effects\r
the top, and the energy density field for the Alcubierre met\u0002ric on the bottom. Before fully exploring the implications of\r
this unanticipated intersection between these two models, the\r
critical elements of the Alcubierre model will be identified\r
and discussed that lead to the energy density that allows the\r
“trick” to work. The motivation for the Alcubierre metric [14]\r
was to develop a model within the context of general relativ\u0002ity that would mathematically encapsulate the idea of a space\r

Fig. 8 [17]. The York Time field is depicted as a grid that\r
has a wave-like appearance with a simple representation of\r
a notional craft overlayed on top of the field to show the\r
connection between the spacetime disturbance and the source\r
of the negative vacuum energy density. The York Time plot\r
indicates that space is expanding behind the spacecraft and\r
contracting in front of the spacecraft. The craft depicted in\r
Footnote 8 continued\r
serving as a multiplier of the ship’s initial velocity, akin to watching\r
a movie in fast-forward. With the canonical form of the metric, the\r
expansion and contraction of space is viewed as a response of spacetime\r
as the hyperfast craft transits through space – space piles up in front of\r
the craft and stretches out behind the craft.\r

the plot has a central part located in the center of the warp\r
bubble in the region where the spacetime is flat, the proper\r
acceleration α is zero, and local clocks are synchronized with\r
external clocks on earth. The craft is equipped with a ring\r
structure that represents an encapsulation of exotic matter or\r
negative vacuum energy density distributed throughout.\r
The York Time, θ, and the energy density distribution T 00,\r
are shown in Eqs. (11) and (12) respectively. The vs term\r
again represents the velocity of the craft, xs represents the\r
position of the center of the craft (and hence the fields), and\r
the y2 and z2 just define a radial distance ρ from the central\r
x-axis. Anecdotally, a sensitivity analysis of the field equa\u0002tions conducted in [19,20] showed that by varying the shell\r
thickness parameter, σ, one could reduce the magnitude of\r
the York Time, and as a result the total energy required to\r
make the concept work. The analysis effort created two ani\u0002mations available online that show the response of the York\r
Time field [21] and the energy density field [22] to variation\r
of the shell thickness parameter. The animations show that\r
as the warp bubble wall thickness increases the peak energy\r
density decreases significantly, and as the warp bubble wall\r
thickness decreases the peak energy density increases. The\r
reasoning behind this response is that the York Time can be\r
viewed as a sort of 3-dimensional strain of space, and as\r
the shell thickness increases, the amount of 3-dimensional\r
strain needed to manifest a target speed vs decreases which\r
is accompanied by a decrease of energy density, and thus a\r
reduction in total energy. This is not without a cost – as can\r
be seen in the online animation of the York Time field, the\r
region of flat spacetime available for the critical portions of\r
the craft, say for a crew or science instruments, is decreased\r
as the bubble wall thickness is increased. So the energy opti\u0002mization process has a competing constraint in the form of\r
the required size, R, for the warp bubble to adequately encap\u0002sulate sensitive cargo within the flat spacetime region inside\r
the bubble wall.\r

Now that the Alcubierre metric has been introduced and\r
the critical elements have been identified and discussed, a\r
comparison between the exotic matter requirements of the\r
warp concept and the numeric worldline analysis results for\r
the custom Casimir cavity may now be made. The top panel\r

plot also includes a simple representation of craft overlayed to illustrate\r
the alignment of the exotic matter ring (T 00) with the expansion and\r
contraction of space. It should be noted that the flat region at the mid\u0002dle of the York Time plot represents the region of flat spacetime in the\r
middle of the warp bubble where coordinate time is the same as proper\r
time, and proper acceleration α is zero. This would be where sensitive\r
spacecraft systems/instruments and possibly crew would be located.\r
The effective velocity of the spacecraft is overlayed as a red vector\r
for the Casimir cavity is in effect a linear extrusion extend\u0002ing up from the surface of the paper meaning the lenticular\r
shaped concentration is rod-like, while the Alcubierre plot is\r
a revolution which yields a toroidal distribution.\r
Based on the custom Casimir cavity results for the parallel\r
plate cavity with a cylindrical pillar at the mid-plane, a toy\r
model comprised of a 1 µm diameter sphere suspended in\r
the middle of a 4 µm diameter cylinder was implemented\r
and the numeric worldline analysis technique was used find\r
the predicted Casimir energy density. Figure 10a shows a sec\u0002tion cut of the toroidal Casimir energy density for the sphere\u0002cylinder system which correlates well with the toroidal Alcu\u0002bierre energy density requirements. If one could manufacture\r
a chip with these types of nano structures (nano-spheres sus\u0002pended in nano-tubes), an experiment might be designed and\r
attempted to conduct a test to measure transit time of say a\r
current (alternately a photon or electron) through a tiny con\u0002ductor (alternately open bore) routed through the center of\r
the sphere(s). This transit time could be compared to the time\r
it takes for a current (photon/electron) to run through a mir\u0002ror system that has no external tube (control test). If need be,\r
many of these nano structures could be arranged in parallel\r
to increase the time resolution of the notional experiment\r

5 Conclusions\r
The impetus for the work discussed in this manuscript was\r
to explore the implications of the dynamic vacuum model as\r
applied to a custom Casimir cavity geometry. The dynamic\r
vacuum model suggests that the state of the negative vacuum\r
energy density in the cavity is not just an isotropic value that\r
is constant throughout the enclosing geometry, rather it has\r
spatial variation and can manifest complicated structure. In\r
the process of the team exploring the literature, a technique\r
called worldline numerics was discovered that also predicts\r
that there is structure to the perturbed vacuum state that is\r
predicted to exist in a notional Casimir cavity. This tech\u0002nique was used to evaluate the predicted state of the vacuum\r
in response to the presence of small pillars placed at the mid\u0002plane of a Casimir cavity. The analysis showed that the pillar\r
would not adversely screen itself from the predicted back\u0002ground field that exists in response to just the presence of\r
the plates. The analysis also showed a possible intersection\r
with a model developed in the context of general relativity to\r
understand how hyperfast stellar travel might be manifested\r
mathematically. The qualitative correlation would suggest\r
that a chip-scale experiment might be explored to attempt to\r
measure a tiny signature illustrative of the presence of the\r
conjectured phenomenon.\r

Abstract While conducting analysis related to a DARPA\u0002funded project to evaluate possible structure of the energy\r
density present in a Casimir cavity as predicted by the\r
dynamic vacuum model, a micro/nano-scale structure has\r
been discovered that predicts negative energy density distri\u0002bution that closely matches requirements for the Alcubierre\r
metric. The simplest notional geometry being analyzed as\r
part of the DARPA-funded work consists of a standard par\u0002allel plate Casimir cavity equipped with pillars arrayed along\r
the cavity mid-plane with the purpose of detecting a transient\r
electric field arising from vacuum polarization conjectured to\r
occur along the midplane of the cavity. An analytic technique\r
called worldline numerics was adapted to numerically assess\r
vacuum response to the custom Casimir cavity, and these\r
numerical analysis results were observed to be qualitatively\r
quite similar to a two-dimensional representation of energy\r
density requirements for the Alcubierre warp metric. Subse\u0002quently, a toy model consisting of a 1 µm diameter sphere\r
centrally located in a 4µm diameter cylinder was analyzed to\r
show a three-dimensional Casimir energy density that corre\u0002lates well with the Alcubierre warp metric requirements. This\r
qualitative correlation would suggest that chip-scale experi\u0002ments might be explored to attempt to measure tiny signatures\r
illustrative of the presence of the conjectured phenomenon:\r
a real, albeit humble, warp bubble."""

paper is to apply this very powerful and flexible technique to\r
fairly complicated geometries where only numerical methods\r
can effectively be used. In our validation effort, we confirmed\r
that our model predict the correct Casimir force for a given\r

it actually serves to slightly increase the effective negative\r

does not adversely self-screen itself in a manner that prevents\r
it from seeing the field magnitude in the cavity with no pillar\r
present. Rather, due to the slightly elevated state, it could\r
be reasoned that the pillar seems to focus the gradient in a\r
manner that would at most allow the pillar to drain the stored\r
energy in the cavity at a quicker rate once it is connected to\r
a high impedance oscilloscope.This effect might result in a\r
need for more cavities to provide enough stored energy such\r

the York Time, and as a result the total energy required to\r
make the concept work. The analysis effort created two ani\u0002mations available online that show the response of the York\r
Time field [21] and the energy density field [22] to variation\r
of the shell thickness parameter. The animations show that\r
as the warp bubble wall thickness increases the peak energy\r
density decreases significantly, and as the warp bubble wall\r
thickness decreases the peak energy density increases. The\r
reasoning behind this response is that the York Time can be\r
viewed as a sort of 3-dimensional strain of space, and as\r
the shell thickness increases, the amount of 3-dimensional\r
strain needed to manifest a target speed vs decreases which\r
is accompanied by a decrease of energy density, and thus a\r
reduction in total energy. This is not without a cost – as can\r
be seen in the online animation of the York Time field, the\r
region of flat spacetime available for the critical portions of\r
the craft, say for a crew or science instruments, is decreased\r
as the bubble wall thickness is increased. So the energy opti\u0002mization process has a competing constraint in the form of\r
the required size, R, for the warp bubble to adequately encap\u0002sulate sensitive cargo within the flat spacetime region inside\r

The impetus for the work discussed in this manuscript was\r
to explore the implications of the dynamic vacuum model as\r
applied to a custom Casimir cavity geometry. The dynamic\r
vacuum model suggests that the state of the negative vacuum\r
energy density in the cavity is not just an isotropic value that\r
is constant throughout the enclosing geometry, rather it has\r
spatial variation and can manifest complicated structure. In\r
the process of the team exploring the literature, a technique\r
called worldline numerics was discovered that also predicts\r
that there is structure to the perturbed vacuum state that is\r
predicted to exist in a notional Casimir cavity. This tech\u0002nique was used to evaluate the predicted state of the vacuum\r
in response to the presence of small pillars placed at the mid\u0002plane of a Casimir cavity. The analysis showed that the pillar\r
would not adversely screen itself from the predicted back\u0002ground field that exists in response to just the presence of\r
the plates. The analysis also showed a possible intersection\r
with a model developed in the context of general relativity to\r
understand how hyperfast stellar travel might be manifested\r
mathematically. The qualitative correlation would suggest\r
that a chip-scale experiment might be explored to attempt to\r
measure a tiny signature illustrative of the presence of the\r
conjectured phenomenon.\r
