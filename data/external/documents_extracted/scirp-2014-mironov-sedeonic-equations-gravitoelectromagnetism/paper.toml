Abstract\r
In present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of space-time algebra \r
of sixteen-component sedeons. The generalized sedeonic second-order equation for unified gra\u0002vito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism is \r
proposed. The relations for the GE field energy, momentum and Lorentz invariants are derived. \r
The special case of GE field described by first-order sedeonic wave equation is also discussed.\r

1. Introduction\r
The analogy between electromagnetic and gravitational fields was discussed by many researchers starting from J. \r
C. Maxwell and O. Heaviside [1] [2]. This analogy motivated many attempts to reformulate the equations of \r
Newtonian gravitation in the form similar to the Maxwell equations in electrodynamics. Such approach is based \r
on two general assumptions. First is the existence of gravitomagnetic field connected with moving masses. \r
Second is the hypothesis that the speed of gravitational field propagation is equal to the speed of light. These \r
assumptions enable the formulation of phenomenological Maxwell-like equations for gravitational field [3] [4]. \r
On the other hand, recently it was shown that linearized weak field equations of general relativity [5]-[9] can be \r
represented as the set of Maxwell-like equations for the vectorial gravitational field and now this linear approx\u0002imation (so-called “post-Newtonian approximation”) is widely used in astrophysics for the analysis of interac\u0002tions between moving and spinning masses [8]-[13]. However, the Heaviside-Gibbs vector algebra, which is \r
usually used for the formulation of electromagnetism and linear gravity, does not adequately specify the space\u0002time properties of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Since the Maxwell equations are the system of four \r
equations for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and pseudovector values, the application of multi-component algebras 

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov\r

is more appropriate. There are different approaches based on algebra of hypercomplex numbers and Clifford al\u0002gebras to formulate electromagnetism [14]-[20] and linear gravity [21]-[23] taking into account above men\u0002tioned space symmetry. However, the consideration of total relativistic space-time field’s symmetry requires the \r
introduction of sixteen-component space-time values. There are some attempts to develop a field theory on the \r
basis of sixteen-component structures such as hypercomplex sedenions [24]-[27] and hypercomplex multivec\u0002tors generating associative space-time Clifford algebras [28] [29]. Recently S. Demir and M. Tanisli [27] re\u0002ported the compactification of the linear field equations for gravitational and electromagnetic fields on the basis \r
of conic sedenions. They have shown that formally electromagnetism and gravity can be described by single \r
unified equation for the conic sedenionic potentials. However, the sedenions is nonassociative algebra that leads \r
to the problems in calculating the second-order relations for unified field. Besides, the inclusion of negative \r
energy and negative Pointing vector of gravitational field in a mathematical structure of the unified field equa\u0002tion was not considered.\r
Recently we proposed the sixteen-component associative space-time algebra of scalar-vector objects named \r
by sedeons [30]. The sedeons have the clearly defined geometric meaning, take into account the symmetry of \r
physical values to the space-time inversion and realize the scalar-vector representation of Poincare group. In \r
present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of sedeonic potentials. We show that \r
sedeonic approach enables the introduction of unified sedeonic gravito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing \r
simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism.\r
2. Linear Equations of Gravitation in Flat Space-Time\r
In this section we reproduce the arguments leading to the linear equations of the weak gravitational field. As is \r
well known [6], Einstein’s equation for gravitational field is written as\r

3). In linear approximation [6]-[9] this equation has the following form\r

3. Symmetry of Electrical and Gravitational Charges\r
It is known that Coulomb’s law for the force of electrical interaction between two charged point bodies is writ\u0002ten as follows:\r
1 2\r
12 3 12\r
12\r
e e\r
e\r
q q F r r =   , (11)\r
where e1 q and e2 q are electrical charges, 12 r\r
 is a vector directed from body 1 to body 2, 12 r is the separa\u0002tion between point bodies, which is equal to modulus of 12 r\r
 . For a symmetric description of electromagnetic \r
and gravitational phenomena, we introduce the gravitational charge g q (considered previously in [3] and [31]) \r
as\r
g q Gm = , (12)\r
where m is a mass of gravitating body. Then Newton’s law for gravitational force between two point bodies \r
can be written in the form of Coulomb’s law:\r
1 2\r
12 3 12\r
12\r
g g\r
g\r
q q F r r = −   . (13)\r
Simultaneous consideration of gravitational and electric fields leads us to another symmetry connected with \r
charge conjugation. The idea consists in an introduction of two additional units associated with electrical and \r
gravitational charges. First one is electrical unit e ε , which is changed (in sign) under electrical charge conjuga\u0002tion. Second one is gravitational unit g ε , which is changed (in sign) under gravitational charge conjugation.\r
Since in the classical gravitoelectrodynamics there is no direct interaction between gravitational and electrical \r
charges, the rules of multiplication for units e ε and g ε should be chosen in accordance with Table 1. Besides, \r
we suppose the anticommutativity of these units and assume that the priority of commutation is higher than mul\u0002tiplication, so that\r
εege gee g ε ε =− =− ε ε ε ε . (14)\r
Following this approach, the generalized gravito-electromagnetic charge Q can be presented as\r
Q q iq = − e g e g ε ε (15)\r

e ε g ε\r

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov\r

and generalized Newton-Coulomb law can be written in the following symmetric form:\r
1 2\r
12 3 12\r
12\r
Q Q F r r =  . (16)\r
Indeed, using (15) and (16) we obtain correct expression for the force between two massive electrically charged \r

The sedeonic formalism enables the representation of gravitational and electromagnetic fields as one unified \r
gravito-electromagnetic field. Indeed, the sedeonic second-order equation for massless field can be presented in \r
the following form [30]:\r

where ϕе , Aе\r

 are scalar and vector potentials of electromagnetic (index e) and gravitational \r
(index g) fields. Hereafter we mean that electrical values contain e ε and gravitational values contain g ε units, \r
but we omit them to simplify farther expressions. Let us also consider the sedeonic source of GE field\r

5.2. Plane Wave Solution of Sedeonic First-Order Equation\r
Let us consider the plane wave solution of Equation (50). In this case the potential can be written as:\r
v v =− ⋅ exp{ i t+i k r ω ( )}   W U   , (62)\r
where ω is a frequency, k\r
 is an absolute wave vector and the wave amplitude v U does not depend on \r
coordinates and time. The dependence of the frequency on the wave vector has two branches:\r
ω ck ± = ± , (63)\r
where k is the module of wave vector k\r
\r
. In general, the plane wave solution for the Equation (50) can be \r
written in the following sedeonic form [30]:\r
v v i k i t+i k r exp{ ( )} c\r
ω\r
ω ±\r
±\r
  =− − ⋅    \r
     W e eM t r , (64)\r
where v M is an arbitrary sedeon with constant components. Note that the internal structure of this wave is \r
changed under space and time conjugation. Let us analyze the structure of the plane wave (64) in detail. We \r
suppose that wave vector k\r
 is directed along z axis. Then the first-order Equation (50) can be rewritten in the \r
following equivalent form:\r
tr\r
1 0\r
ct z ν\r
  ∂ ∂\r
+ =′     ∂ ∂\r
 3 ea W , (65)\r
where v i ν W eW   ′ = t . Using (63) and (64) we can write solution of (65) in the following form:\r
v v\r
′\r
+ + =− + (1 ) k i t+i k r exp{− ⋅ ω ( )}     W ea M tr 3 , (66)\r
v v\r
′\r
− − =− − ⋅ (1 ) k i t+i k r exp{ ω ( )}     W ea M tr 3 . (67)\r
Note that the wave function v+ W ′ describes the positive branch of dispersion law (63) that corresponds, for \r
example, to the “antiparticle”, while v− W ′ describes the negative branch that corresponds to the “particle” state. \r
The wave functions (66) and (67) are the eigenfunctions of spin operator [32]:\r
1 ˆ\r
2 z S = tr 3 e a . (68)\r
Indeed, it is simple to check that \r
ˆ\r
zv zv S S W W   ′ ′ = , (69)\r
where eigenvalue 1 2 z S = ± . It is seen that plane wave v+ W ′ describes “antiparticle” state with spirality \r
1 2 z S = + , while v− W ′ describes “particle” state with spirality 1 2 z S = − .\r
6. Discussion\r
From a mathematical point of view, the analogy between electromagnetism and weak gravity leads us to inte\u0002grating these fields into unified equation, which describes the interaction between electrically charged and gra\u0002vitating bodies.\r
On the other hand, from a physical point of view, the phenomena of electricity and gravity are absolutely in-

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov\r
926\r
separable from each other. Naturally, all electrically charged particles have the masses and consequently they \r
are involved in both electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Therefore, all processes involving charged \r
particles should be considered from a unified concept of gravitoelectromagnetism. For example, the electron \r
transitions between excited and ground states in an atom should be accompanied by simultaneous irradiation \r
(absorption) of electromagnetic and gravitational waves (gravito-electromagnetic waves), since in these \r
processes both electric and gravitational interactions of the electron with the atomic nucleus are changed. Also, \r
the processes of particle-antiparticle pair’s nucleation (or annihilation) should be accompanied by absorption (or \r
emission) of gravito-electromagnetic waves. At last, any antennas radiate gravito-electromagnetic waves since \r
an alternating current in the radiating and receiving antennas has both electrical and gravitational components. \r
Thus, the gravitational waves exist everywhere around us. For the sake of justice, it should be noted that the \r
energy of gravitational wave’s components is very small and in general all effects of the interaction between \r
radiation and matter are determined by electromagnetic component.\r
Furthermore, the concept of gravitational charge allows separating the effects of inertia associated with iner\u0002tial mass and the effects of gravity associated with gravitational charge of the particles. For example, the quan\u0002tum sedeonic wave equation [30] for a quantum particle in a gravitational field can be written as\r
1 1 0 0\r
0.\r
g g g g g g g g\r
i i m c i i m c\r
i q qA i i q qA i\r

=\r
t r tr t r tr e e ee e e ψ   \r
     (70)\r
Here the parameter m0 is the inertial rest mass of particle, while g q is the gravitational charge. This opens \r
the way for the quantum description of gravitational interactions of particles.\r
Moreover the operation of charge conjugation allows one to describe the particles with opposite gravitational \r
charges (antimatter [33]) and suppose the repulsive matter-antimatter gravitational interaction.\r
Finally, we showed that the sedeonic first-order Equation (50) describes massless particles with spin 1/2. We \r
believe that this equation can be considered for modeling a neutrino field including electromagnetic and gravita\u0002tional components.\r

Abstract\r
In present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of space-time algebra \r
of sixteen-component sedeons. The generalized sedeonic second-order equation for unified gra\u0002vito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism is \r
proposed. The relations for the GE field energy, momentum and Lorentz invariants are derived. \r
The special case of GE field described by first-order sedeonic wave equation is also discussed.\r

The analogy between electromagnetic and gravitational fields was discussed by many researchers starting from J. \r
C. Maxwell and O. Heaviside [1] [2]. This analogy motivated many attempts to reformulate the equations of \r
Newtonian gravitation in the form similar to the Maxwell equations in electrodynamics. Such approach is based \r
on two general assumptions. First is the existence of gravitomagnetic field connected with moving masses. \r
Second is the hypothesis that the speed of gravitational field propagation is equal to the speed of light. These \r
assumptions enable the formulation of phenomenological Maxwell-like equations for gravitational field [3] [4]. \r
On the other hand, recently it was shown that linearized weak field equations of general relativity [5]-[9] can be \r
represented as the set of Maxwell-like equations for the vectorial gravitational field and now this linear approx\u0002imation (so-called “post-Newtonian approximation”) is widely used in astrophysics for the analysis of interac\u0002tions between moving and spinning masses [8]-[13]. However, the Heaviside-Gibbs vector algebra, which is \r
usually used for the formulation of electromagnetism and linear gravity, does not adequately specify the space\u0002time properties of gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Since the Maxwell equations are the system of four \r
equations for scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and pseudovector values, the application of multi-component algebras 

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov\r

is more appropriate. There are different approaches based on algebra of hypercomplex numbers and Clifford al\u0002gebras to formulate electromagnetism [14]-[20] and linear gravity [21]-[23] taking into account above men\u0002tioned space symmetry. However, the consideration of total relativistic space-time field’s symmetry requires the \r
introduction of sixteen-component space-time values. There are some attempts to develop a field theory on the \r
basis of sixteen-component structures such as hypercomplex sedenions [24]-[27] and hypercomplex multivec\u0002tors generating associative space-time Clifford algebras [28] [29]. Recently S. Demir and M. Tanisli [27] re\u0002ported the compactification of the linear field equations for gravitational and electromagnetic fields on the basis \r
of conic sedenions. They have shown that formally electromagnetism and gravity can be described by single \r
unified equation for the conic sedenionic potentials. However, the sedenions is nonassociative algebra that leads \r
to the problems in calculating the second-order relations for unified field. Besides, the inclusion of negative \r
energy and negative Pointing vector of gravitational field in a mathematical structure of the unified field equa\u0002tion was not considered.\r
Recently we proposed the sixteen-component associative space-time algebra of scalar-vector objects named \r
by sedeons [30]. The sedeons have the clearly defined geometric meaning, take into account the symmetry of \r
physical values to the space-time inversion and realize the scalar-vector representation of Poincare group. In \r
present paper we develop the description of massless fields on the basis of sedeonic potentials. We show that \r
sedeonic approach enables the introduction of unified sedeonic gravito-electromagnetic (GE) field describing \r
simultaneously weak gravity and electromagnetism."""

Simultaneous consideration of gravitational and electric fields leads us to another symmetry connected with \r
charge conjugation. The idea consists in an introduction of two additional units associated with electrical and \r
gravitational charges. First one is electrical unit e ε , which is changed (in sign) under electrical charge conjuga\u0002tion. Second one is gravitational unit g ε , which is changed (in sign) under gravitational charge conjugation.\r
Since in the classical gravitoelectrodynamics there is no direct interaction between gravitational and electrical \r
charges, the rules of multiplication for units e ε and g ε should be chosen in accordance with Table 1. Besides, \r
we suppose the anticommutativity of these units and assume that the priority of commutation is higher than mul\u0002tiplication, so that\r

Let us consider the plane wave solution of Equation (50). In this case the potential can be written as:\r
v v =− ⋅ exp{ i t+i k r ω ( )}   W U   , (62)\r
where ω is a frequency, k\r
 is an absolute wave vector and the wave amplitude v U does not depend on \r
coordinates and time. The dependence of the frequency on the wave vector has two branches:\r
ω ck ± = ± , (63)\r
where k is the module of wave vector k\r
\r

changed under space and time conjugation. Let us analyze the structure of the plane wave (64) in detail. We \r
suppose that wave vector k\r

example, to the “antiparticle”, while v− W ′ describes the negative branch that corresponds to the “particle” state. \r
The wave functions (66) and (67) are the eigenfunctions of spin operator [32]:\r

From a mathematical point of view, the analogy between electromagnetism and weak gravity leads us to inte\u0002grating these fields into unified equation, which describes the interaction between electrically charged and gra\u0002vitating bodies.\r
On the other hand, from a physical point of view, the phenomena of electricity and gravity are absolutely in-

V. L. Mironov, S. V. Mironov\r

separable from each other. Naturally, all electrically charged particles have the masses and consequently they \r
are involved in both electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Therefore, all processes involving charged \r
particles should be considered from a unified concept of gravitoelectromagnetism. For example, the electron \r
transitions between excited and ground states in an atom should be accompanied by simultaneous irradiation \r
(absorption) of electromagnetic and gravitational waves (gravito-electromagnetic waves), since in these \r
processes both electric and gravitational interactions of the electron with the atomic nucleus are changed. Also, \r
the processes of particle-antiparticle pair’s nucleation (or annihilation) should be accompanied by absorption (or \r
emission) of gravito-electromagnetic waves. At last, any antennas radiate gravito-electromagnetic waves since \r
an alternating current in the radiating and receiving antennas has both electrical and gravitational components. \r
Thus, the gravitational waves exist everywhere around us. For the sake of justice, it should be noted that the \r
energy of gravitational wave’s components is very small and in general all effects of the interaction between \r
radiation and matter are determined by electromagnetic component.\r
Furthermore, the concept of gravitational charge allows separating the effects of inertia associated with iner\u0002tial mass and the effects of gravity associated with gravitational charge of the particles. For example, the quan\u0002tum sedeonic wave equation [30] for a quantum particle in a gravitational field can be written as\r
1 1 0 0\r
0.\r

Here the parameter m0 is the inertial rest mass of particle, while g q is the gravitational charge. This opens \r
the way for the quantum description of gravitational interactions of particles.\r
Moreover the operation of charge conjugation allows one to describe the particles with opposite gravitational \r
charges (antimatter [33]) and suppose the repulsive matter-antimatter gravitational interaction.\r
Finally, we showed that the sedeonic first-order Equation (50) describes massless particles with spin 1/2. We \r
believe that this equation can be considered for modeling a neutrino field including electromagnetic and gravita\u0002tional components.\r
