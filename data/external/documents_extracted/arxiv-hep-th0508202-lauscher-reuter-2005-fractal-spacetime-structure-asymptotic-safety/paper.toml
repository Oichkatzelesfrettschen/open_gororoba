Abstract\r
Four-dimensional Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is likely to be an asymp\u0002totically safe theory which is applicable at arbitrarily small distance scales. On\r
sub-Planckian distances it predicts that spacetime is a fractal with an effective di\u0002mensionality of 2. The original argument leading to this result was based upon\r
the anomalous dimension of Newton’s constant. In the present paper we demon\u0002strate that also the spectral dimension equals 2 microscopically, while it is equal to\r
4 on macroscopic scales. This result is an exact consequence of asymptotic safety\r
and does not rely on any truncation. Contact is made with recent Monte Carlo\r
simulations.

1 Introduction\r
Soon after the detailed investigation of Quantum Einstein Gravity [1]-[17] had begun and\r
it had become clear that the theory is likely to be nonperturbatively renormalizable or\r
“asymptotically safe” [8, 3, 5, 6] it was observed [3, 5] that it predicts a fractal space\u0002time structure at sub-Planckian distances whose effective dimensionality equals 2. On\r
the technical side, a key tool in the nonperturbative investigation of Quantum Einstein\r
Gravity (QEG) was the effective average action and its associated exact renormalization\r
group (RG) equation which had been developed in [18, 19] and was first applied to gravity\r
in [1]. (For general reviews see [20],[21].)\r
In QEG, the effective average action Γk[gµν] defines an infinite set of effective field\r
theories, valid near a variable mass scale k which is introduced as an infrared (IR) cutoff\r
and varies between k = 0 and k = ∞ [1]. Intuitively speaking, the solution hgµνikof the\r
scale dependent field equation\r
δΓk\r
δgµν(x)\r
[hgi\r
k\r
] = 0 (1.1)\r
can be interpreted as the metric averaged over (Euclidean) spacetime volumes of a linear\r
extension ℓ which typically is of the order of 1/k. Knowing the scale dependence of Γk,\r
i.e. the renormalization group trajectory k 7→ Γk, we can in principle follow the solution\r
hgµνikfrom the ultraviolet (k → ∞) to the infrared (k → 0).\r
It is an important feature of this approach that the infinitely many equations of (1.1),\r
one for each scale k, are valid simultaneously. They all refer to the same physical system,\r
the “quantum spacetime”, but describe its effective metric structure on different scales.\r
An observer using a “microscope” with a resolution ≈ k\r
−1 will perceive the universe to be\r
a Riemannian manifold with metric hgµνik. At every fixed k, hgµνikis a smooth classical\r
metric. But since the quantum spacetime is characterized by the infinity of equations\r
(1.1) with k = 0, · · · , ∞ it can acquire very nonclassical and in particular fractal features.\r
Let us describe more precisely what it means to “average” over Euclidean spacetime\r
volumes. The quantity we can freely tune is the IR cutoff scale k, and the “resolving\r
1

power” of the microscope, henceforth denoted ℓ, is in general a complicated function of\r
k. (In flat space, ℓ ≈ 1/k.) In order to understand the relationship between ℓ and k we\r
must recall some steps from the construction of Γk[gµν] in ref. [1].\r
The effective average action is obtained by introducing an IR cutoff into the path\u0002integral over all metrics, gauge fixed by means of a background gauge fixing condition.\r
Even without a cutoff the resulting effective action Γ[gµν; ¯gµν] depends on two metrics,\r
the expectation value of the quantum field, gµν, and the background field ¯gµν . This is a\r
standard technique, and it is well known [23] that the functional Γ[gµν] ≡ Γ[gµν ; ¯gµν = gµν]\r
obtained by equating the two metrics can be used to generate the 1PI Green’s functions\r
of the theory.\r
The IR cutoff of the average action is implemented by first expressing the functional\r
integral over all metrics in terms of eigenmodes of D¯ 2, the covariant Laplacian formed with\r
the aid of the background metric ¯gµν. Then a suppression term is introduced which damps\r
the contribution of all −D¯ 2-modes with eigenvalues smaller than k\r
2\r
. Following the usual\r
steps [20] this leads to the scale dependent functional Γk[gµν ; ¯gµν], and the action with\r
one argument again obtains by equating the two metrics: Γk[gµν ] ≡ Γk[gµν; ¯gµν = gµν].\r
It is this action which appears in (1.1). Because of the identification of the two metrics\r
we see that it is basically the eigenmodes of D¯ 2 = D2, constructed from the argument of\r
Γk[g], which are cut off at k\r
2\r
. Since hgµνi\r
k\r
is the corresponding stationary point, we can\r
say that the metric hgµνikapplies to the situation where only the quantum fluctuations\r
of −D2(hgµν ik) with eigenvalues larger than k\r
2\r
are integrated out. Therefore there is a\r
complicated interrelation between the metric and the scale at which it provides an effective\r
description: The covariant Laplacian which ultimately decides about which modes are\r
integrated out is constructed from the “on shell” configuration hgµνik, so it is k-dependent\r
by itself already.\r
From these remarks it is clear now how to obtain the “resolving power” ℓ for a given\r
k, at least in principle. We take the Laplacian −D2(hgµνik), solve its eigenvalue problem,\r
and then analyze in particular the properties of the eigenfunction(s) with eigenvalue k\r
2\r
2

(or near k\r
2\r
in the case of a discrete spectrum). Loosely speaking, this eigenfunction is the\r
last one integrated out. As a consequence, the “averaging” scale is crucially determined\r
by “how fast” this eigenfunction varies over spacetime. Let us assume, for instance, this\r
eigenfunction is oscillatory with a coordinate period ∆x. Then, again by using hgµνik,\r
we compute the physical proper length this period corresponds to, and this is then what\r
determines the resolution ℓ.\r
In general the eigenfunction at k\r
2 will have a complicated x-dependence, and therefore\r
also the typical scales on which it varies are position dependent. Moreover, at a given\r
point, the scale of significant variation will be direction dependent (anisotropic). There\u0002fore the resolving power ℓ = ℓ(k; x, n) is a complicated function in general, depending\r
parametrically on points (x\r
µ\r
) and directions (n\r
µ\r
) on spacetime. It is clear that these\r
notions can be made precise only in concrete examples and must be defined on a case by\r
case basis.\r
We emphasize, however, that using the averaged metric itself to define the scale it is\r
averaged over is not a vicious circle, but rather is exactly as it must be in a background\r
independent approach to the quantization of gravity.\r
In a somewhat simplified form, the construction of a quantum spacetime within QEG\r
can be summarized as follows. We start from a fixed RG trajectory k 7→ Γk, derive its\r
effective field equations at each k, and solve them. The resulting quantum mechanical\r
counterpart of a classical spacetime is specified by the infinity of Riemannian metrics\r
{hgµνik|k = 0, · · · , ∞}. While the totality of these metrics contains all physical infor\u0002mation, the parameter k is only a book keeping device a priori. In a second step, it\r
can be given a physical interpretation by relating it to the (proper) length scale of the\r
averaging procedure: One constructs the Laplacian −D2(hgµνik), diagonalizes it, looks\r
how rapidly its k\r
2\r
-eigenfunction varies, and “measures” the length of typical variations\r
with the metric hgµν ikitself. By solving the resulting ℓ = ℓ(k) for k = k(ℓ) we can in\r
principle reinterprete the metric hgµν ikas referring to a microscope with a known position\r
and direction dependent resolving power. The price we have to pay for the background\r
3

independence is that we cannot freely choose ℓ directly but rather k only.\r
The first difficult step in this construction program consists in finding the RG trajec\u0002tories. The running action Γk[gµν ] is given by an exact functional RG equation [1]. In\r
practice it is usually solved on a truncated theory space. In the Einstein-Hilbert trunca\u0002tion, for instance, Γk is approximated by a functional of the form\r
Γk[g] = (16πGk)\r

(1.2)\r
involving a running Newton constant Gk and cosmological constant λ¯\r
k. Their k-dependence\r
can be obtained from the RG equation projected onto the truncation subspace. The β\u0002functions for the dimensionless couplings gk ≡ k\r
2 Gk and λk ≡ λ¯\r
k/k2 were first obtained in\r
[1]. Remarkably, they turned out to possess a simultaneous zero at a non-Gaussian fixed\r
point (NGFP) (g∗, λ∗) which has just the right properties needed for the nonperturbative\r
renormalizability of QEG along the lines of Weinberg’s [22] ideas on “asymptotic safety”\r
[8]. It was argued [3, 5, 6] that the NGFP is likely to exist also in the un-truncated, full\r
theory and allows for the construction of a consistent and predictive microscopic theory\r
of quantum gravity valid at arbitrarily small distances even.\r
One of the highly intriguing conclusions we reached in refs. [3, 5] was that the effective\r
dimensionality of spacetime is scale dependent. It equals 4 at macroscopic distances\r
(ℓ ≫ ℓPl) but, near ℓ ≈ ℓPl, it gets dynamically reduced to the value 2. For ℓ ≪ ℓPl\r
spacetime is, in a precise sense [3], a 2-dimensional fractal.\r
In ref. [24] the specific form of the graviton propagator on this fractal was applied in a\r
cosmological context. It was argued that it gives rise to a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of\r
primordial geometry fluctuations, perhaps responsible for the CMBR spectrum observed\r
today.\r
In refs. [24]-[32] various types of “RG improvements” were used to explore possible\r
manifestations of the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters.\r
Along a quite different line of investigation, considerable progress has been made\r
recently towards defining a quantum theory of gravity as the continuum limit of a discrete\r
4

model of statistical mechanics. Performing comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations within\r
the framework of causal (Lorentzian) triangulated geometries [33], Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz\r
and Loll [34]-[36] collected strong evidence indicating that these models can describe\r
universes which are extended both in space and time and are 4-dimensional on large\r
scales. In particular the above authors “measured” numerically the spectral and Hausdorff\r
dimensions of the spacetimes and their time slices, respectively. Remarkably, they, too,\r
find that the (spectral) dimension Ds of the spacetime reduces dynamically from Ds ≈ 4\r
at large distances to Ds ≈ 2 on small length scales.\r
While until recently it has been difficult to compare the continuum theory to the\r
discrete causal triangulation approach, the new Monte Carlo results suggest that they\r
might be closely related, possibly representing the same “universality class”.\r
In our original argument [3] we determined the effective dimensionality of the fractal\r
realized at sub-Planckian distances (in the asymptotic scaling regime of the NGFP) from\r
the anomalous dimension ηN at the NGFP. A priori this definition of an effective dimen\u0002sionality is different from the one used in the Monte Carlo simulations. It is the main\r
purpose of the present paper to apply the reasoning from [3, 5] to the definition of the\r
effective dimension which was employed by Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz and Loll [36], namely\r
the spectral dimension Ds.\r
We shall demonstrate that asymptotically safe QEG does indeed predict Ds = 4\r
at ℓ ≫ ℓPl and Ds = 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl. (The Planck length and mass are defined as\r
ℓPl ≡ m−1\r
Pl ≡ G(k = 0)1/2\r
.)\r
As a preparation we review and extend the discussion of refs. [3, 5] in Section 2, and\r
in Section 3 we compute the spectral dimension of the QEG spacetimes.\r
2 QEG spacetimes under the microscope\r
For simplicity we use the Einstein-Hilbert truncation to start with, and we consider space\u0002times with classical dimensionality d = 4. The corresponding RG trajectories were com\u00025

pletely classified and determined numerically in [4]. The physically relevant ones, for\r
k → ∞, all approach the NGFP at (g∗, λ∗) so that the dimensionful quantities run ac\u0002cording to\r
Gk ≈ g∗/k2, λ¯\r
k ≈ λ∗ k\r
2\r
(2.1)\r
The behavior (2.1) is realized in the asymptotic scaling regime k ≫ mPl. Near k = mPl\r
the trajectories cross over towards the Gaussian fixed point at g = λ = 0, and then run\r
towards negative, vanishing, and positive values of λ, respectively.\r
Since in this paper we are interested only in the limiting cases of very small and\r
very large distances the following caricature of a RG trajectory will be sufficient. We\r
assume that Gk and λ¯\r
k behave as in (2.1) for k ≫ mPl, and that they assume constant\r
values for k ≪ mPl. The precise interpolation between the two regimes could be obtained\r
numerically [4] but will not be needed here.\r
The argument of ref. [5] concerning the fractal nature of the QEG spacetimes was\r
as follows. Within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation of theory space, the effective field\r
equations (1.1) happen to coincide with the ordinary Einstein equation, but with Gk and\r
λ¯\r
k replacing the classical constants. Without matter,\r
Rµν (hgik) = λ¯\r
k hgµν ik\r
(2.2)\r
Since in absence of dimensionful constants of integration λ¯\r
k is the only quantity in this\r
equation which sets a scale, every solution to (2.2) has a typical radius of curvature\r
rc(k) ∝ 1/\r
p\r
λ¯\r
k. (For instance, the maximally symmetric S\r
4\r
-solution has the radius\r
rc = r =\r
p\r
3/λ¯\r
k.) If we want to explore the spacetime structure at a fixed length scale\r
ℓ we should use the action Γk[gµν ] at k = 1/ℓ because with this functional a tree level\r
analysis is sufficient to describe the essential physics at this scale, including the relevant\r
quantum effects. Hence, when we observe the spacetime with a microscope of resolution\r
ℓ, we will see an average radius of curvature given by rc(ℓ) ≡ rc(k = 1/ℓ). Once ℓ is\r
smaller than the Planck length ℓPl ≡ m−1\r
Pl we are in the fixed point regime where λ¯\r
k ∝ k\r
2\r
6

so that rc(k) ∝ 1/k, or\r
rc(ℓ) ∝ ℓ (2.3)\r
Thus, when we look at the structure of spacetime with a microscope of resolution ℓ ≪ ℓPl,\r
the average radius of curvature which we measure is proportional to the resolution itself.\r
If we want to probe finer details and decrease ℓ we automatically decrease rc and hence\r
increase the average curvature. Spacetime seems to be more strongly curved at small\r
distances than at larger ones. The scale-free relation (2.3) suggests that at distances\r
below the Planck length the QEG spacetime is a special kind of fractal with a self-similar\r
structure. It has no intrinsic scale because in the fractal regime, i.e. when the RG\r
trajectory is still close to the NGFP, the parameters which usually set the scales of the\r
gravitational interaction, G and λ¯, are not yet “frozen out”. This happens only later on,\r
somewhere half way between the non-Gaussian and the Gaussian fixed point, at a scale\r
of the order of mPl.\r
Below this scale, Gk and λ¯\r
k stop running and, as a result, rc(k) becomes independent\r
of k so that rc(ℓ) = const for ℓ ≫ ℓPl. In this regime hgµνikis k-independent, indicating\r
that the macroscopic spacetime is describable by a single smooth, classical Riemannian\r
manifold.\r
The above argument made essential use of the proportionality ℓ ∝ 1/k. In the fixed\r
point regime it follows trivially from the fact that there exist no relevant dimensionful\r
parameters so that 1/k is the only length scale one can form. The algorithm for the\r
determination of ℓ(k) described in the Introduction yields the same answer.\r
It is easy to make the k-dependence of hgµν ikexplicit. Picking an arbitrary reference\r
scale k0 we may rewrite (2.2) as [λ¯\r
k0/λ¯k] Rµ\r
ν\r
(hgik) = λ¯\r
k0\r
δ\r
µ\r
ν\r
. Since Rµ\r
ν\r
(c g) = c\r
−1 Rµ\r
ν\r
(g)\r
for any constant c > 0, this relation implies that the average metric scales as\r
hgµν(x)ik = [λ¯\r
k0/λ¯k]hgµν(x)ik0\r
(2.4)\r
and its inverse according to\r
hg\r
µν(x)ik = [λ¯\r
k/λ¯k0\r
]hg\r
µν(x)ik0\r
(2.5)\r
7

These relations are valid provided the family of solutions considered exists for all scales\r
between k0 and k, and λ¯\r
k has the same sign always.\r
As we discussed in ref. [3] the QEG spacetime has an effective dimensionality which\r
is k-dependent and hence noninteger in general. Our discussion in [3] was based upon\r
the anomalous dimension ηN of the operator R √g R. It is defined as ηN ≡ −k ∂k ln ZNk\r
where ZNk ∝ 1/Gk is the wavefunction renormalization of the metric [1]. In a sense\r
which we shall make more precise in a moment, the effective dimensionality of spacetime\r
equals 4 + ηN . The RG trajectories of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation (within its domain\r
of validity) have ηN ≈ 0 for k → 0\r
1 and ηN ≈ −2 for k → ∞, the smooth change by\r
two units occuring near k ≈ mPl. As a consequence, the effective dimensionality is 4 for\r
ℓ ≫ ℓPl and 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl.\r
In fact, the UV fixed point has an anomalous dimension η ≡ ηN (g∗, λ∗) = −2. We\r
can use this information in order to determine the momentum dependence of the dressed\r
graviton propagator for momenta p\r
2 ≫ m2\r
Pl. Expanding the Γk of (1.2) about flat space\r
and omitting the standard tensor structures we find the inverse propagator Gek(p)\r
−1 ∝\r
ZN (k) p\r
2\r
. The conventional dressed propagator Ge(p) contained in Γ ≡ Γk=0 obtains from\r
the exact Gek in the limit k → 0. For p\r
2 > k2 ≫ m2\r
Pl the actual cutoff scale is the physical\r
momentum p\r
2\r
itself2so that the k-evolution of Gek(p) stops at the threshold k =\r
p\r
p\r

.\r
Therefore\r
Ge(p)\r

because ZN (k) ∝ k\r
−η when η ≡ −∂t\r
lnZN is (approximately) constant. In d dimensions,\r
and for η 6= 2 − d, the Fourier transform of Ge(p) ∝ 1/(p\r
2\r
)\r
1−η/2 yields the following\r
propagator in position space:\r
G(x; y) ∝\r
1\r
|x − y|\r
d−2+η\r
. (2.7)\r
1\r
In the case of type IIIa trajectories [4, 31] the macroscopic k-value is still far above kterm, i.e. in the\r
“GR regime” described in [31].\r
2See Section 1 of ref. [29] for a detailed discussion of “decoupling” phenomena of this kind.\r
8

This form of the propagator is well known from the theory of critical phenomena, for\r
instance. (In the latter case it applies to large distances.) Eq. (2.7) is not valid directly\r
at the NGFP. For d = 4 and η = −2 the dressed propagator is Ge(p) = 1/p4 which has the\r
following representation in position space:\r
G(x; y) = −\r
1\r
8π\r
2\r
ln (µ |x − y|) . (2.8)\r
Here µ is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a mass. Obviously (2.8) has the\r
same form as a 1/p2-propagator in 2 dimensions.\r
Slightly away from the NGFP, before other physical scales intervene, the propagator is\r
of the familiar type (2.7) which shows that the quantity ηN has the standard interpretation\r
of an anomalous dimension in the sense that fluctuation effects modify the decay properties\r
of G so as to correspond to a spacetime of effective dimensionality 4 + ηN .\r
Thus the properties of the RG trajectories imply a remarkable dimensional reduction:\r
Spacetime, probed by a “graviton” with p\r
2 ≪ m2\r
Pl is 4-dimensional, but it appears to be\r
2-dimensional for a graviton with p\r
2 ≫ m2\r
Pl [3].\r
It is interesting to note that in d classical dimensions, where the macroscopic spacetime\r
is d-dimensional, the anomalous dimension at the fixed point is η = 2 − d. Therefore, for\r
any d, the dimensionality of the fractal as implied by ηN is d + η = 2 [3, 5].\r
3 The spectral dimension\r
In this section we determine the spectral dimension Ds of the QEG spacetimes. This\r
particular definition of a fractal dimension is borrowed from the theory of diffusion pro\u0002cesses on fractals [37] and is easily adapted to the quantum gravity context [38, 36]. In\r
particular it has been used in the Monte Carlo studies mentioned in the Introduction.\r
Let us study the diffusion of a scalar test particle on a d-dimensional classical Euclidean\r
manifold with a fixed smooth metric gµν(x). The corresponding heat-kernel Kg(x, x′; T)\r
giving the probability for the particle to diffuse from x\r
′\r
to x during the fictitious diffusion\r
9

time T satisfies the heat equation\r
∂T Kg(x, x′; T) = ∆gKg(x, x′; T) (3.1)\r
where ∆g ≡ D2 denotes the scalar Laplacian: ∆gφ ≡ g\r
−1/2 ∂µ(g1/2\r
g\r
µν ∂νφ). The heat\u0002kernel is a matrix element of the operator exp(T ∆g). In the random walk picture its\r
trace per unit volume,\r
Pg(T) ≡ V\r
−1\r
Z\r
d\r
dx\r
p\r
g(x) Kg(x, x; T) ≡ V\r
−1 Tr exp(T ∆g) , (3.2)\r
has the interpretation of an average return probability. (Here V ≡\r
R\r
d\r
dx\r
√g denotes the\r
total volume.) It is well known that Pg possesses an asymptotic expansion (for T → 0)\r
of the form Pg(T) = (4πT)\r
−d/2 P∞\r
n=0 An T\r
n\r
. For an infinite flat space, for instance, it\r
reads Pg(T) = (4πT)\r
−d/2\r
for all T. Thus, knowing the function Pg, one can recover the\r
dimensionality of the target manifold as the T-independent logarithmic derivative\r
d = −2\r
d ln Pg(T)\r
d ln T\r
(3.3)\r
This formula can also be used for curved spaces and spaces with finite volume V provided\r
T is not taken too large [36].\r
In QEG where we functionally integrate over all metrics it is natural to replace Pg(T)\r
by its expectation value. Symbolically,\r
P(T) ≡ hPγ(T)i ≡ ZDγ DC DC P ¯\r
γ(T) e\r
−Sbare[γ,C,C¯]\r
(3.4)\r
Here γµν denotes the microscopic metric and Sbare is the bare action with the gauge fixing\r
terms and the pieces containing the ghosts C and C¯ included. Note that (3.4) does\r
not contain any IR cutoff; it is the ordinary (k = 0) expectation value with all modes\r
integrated out. In QEG the functional Sbare is given by the fixed point action. Given\r
P(T), the spectral dimension of the quantum spacetime is defined in analogy with (3.3):\r
Ds = −2\r
d ln P(T)\r
d ln T\r
(3.5)\r
10

Let us now evaluate the expectation value (3.4) using the average action method.\r
The fictitious diffusion process takes place on a “manifold” which, at every fixed scale,\r
is described by a smooth Riemannian metric hgµν ik. While the situation appears to be\r
classical at fixed k, nonclassical features emerge in the regime with nontrivial RG running\r
since there the metric depends on the scale at which the spacetime structure is probed.\r
The nonclassical features are encoded in the properties of the diffusion operator. De\u0002noting the covariant Laplacians corresponding to the metrics hgµνik\r
and hgµν ik0by ∆(k)\r
and ∆(k0), respectively, eqs. (2.4) and (2.5) imply that they are related by\r
∆(k) = [λ¯\r
k/λ¯k0\r
] ∆(k0) (3.6)\r
When k, k0 ≫ mPl we have, for example,\r
∆(k) = (k/k0)\r
2 ∆(k0) (3.7)\r
Recalling that the average action Γk defines an effective field theory at the scale k we\r
have that hO(γµν)i ≈ O(hgµν ik) if the operator O involves typical covariant momenta of\r
the order k and hgµνiksolves eq. (1.1). In the following we exploit this relationship for\r
the RHS of the diffusion equation, O = ∆γ Kγ(x, x′; T). It is crucial here to correctly\r
identify the relevant scale k.\r
If the diffusion process involves (approximately) only a small interval of scales near k\r
over which λ¯\r
k does not change much the corresponding heat equation contains the ∆(k)\r
for this specific, fixed value of k:\r
∂T K(x, x′; T) = ∆(k)K(x, x′; T) (3.8)\r
Denoting the eigenvalues of −∆(k0) by En and the corresponding eigenfunctions by φn,\r
this equation is solved by\r
K(x, x′; T) = X\r

(3.9)\r
Here we introduced the convenient notation F(k\r
2\r
) ≡ λ¯\r
k/λ¯k0\r
. Knowing this propaga\u0002tion kernel we can time-evolve any initial probability distribution p(x; 0) according to\r

p(x; T) = R\r

initial distribution has an eigenfunction expansion of the form p(x; 0) = P\r

obtain\r

\u0011\r
(3.10)\r
If the Cn’s are significantly different from zero only for a single eigenvalue EN , we are\r
dealing with a single-scale problem. In the usual spirit of effective field theories we would\r
then identify k\r
2 = EN as the relevant scale at which the running couplings are to be\r
evaluated.\r
However, in general the Cn’s are different from zero over a wide range of eigenvalues.\r
In this case we face a multiscale problem where different modes φn probe the spacetime\r
on different length scales.\r
If ∆(k0) corresponds to flat space, say, the eigenfunctions φn ≡ φp are plane waves\r
with momentum p\r
µ\r
, and they resolve structures on a length scale ℓ of order 1/|p|. Hence,\r
in terms of the eigenvalue En ≡ Ep = p\r
2\r
the resolution is ℓ ≈ 1/\r
√\r
En. This suggests that\r
when the manifold is probed by a mode with eigenvalue En it “sees” the metric hgµνikfor\r
the scale k =\r
√\r
En. Actually the identification k =\r
√\r
En is correct also for curved space\r
since, in the construction of Γk, the parameter k is introduced precisely as a cutoff in the\r
spectrum of the covariant Laplacian.\r
Therefore we conclude that under the spectral sum of (3.10) we must use the scale\r
k\r
2 = En which depends explicitly on the resolving power of the corresponding mode.\r
Likewise, in eq. (3.9), F(k\r
2\r
) is to be interpreted as F(En). Thus we obtain the traced\r
propagation kernel\r
P(T) = V\r

It is convenient to choose k0 as a macroscopic scale in a regime where there are no\r
strong RG effects any more.\r
12

Furthermore, let us assume for a moment that at k0 the cosmological constant is tiny,\r
λ¯\r
k0 ≈ 0, so that hgµνik0\r
is an approximately flat metric. In this case the trace in eq. (3.11)\r
is easily evaluated in a plane wave basis:\r
P(T) = Z\r

(3.12)\r
The T-dependence of (3.12) determines the fractal dimensionality of spacetime via (3.5).\r
In the limits T → ∞ and T → 0 where the random walks probe very large and small\r
distances, respectively, we obtain the dimensionalities corresponding to the largest and\r
smallest length scales possible. The limits T → ∞ and T → 0 of P(T) are determined by\r
the behavior of F(p\r
2\r
) ≡ λ¯(k =\r
p\r
p\r
2\r
)/λ¯\r
k0\r
for p\r
2 → 0 and p2 → ∞, respectively.\r
For a RG trajectory where the renormalization effects stop below some threshold we\r
have F(p\r
2 → 0) = 1. In this case (3.12) yields P(T) ∝ 1/T2\r
, and we conclude that the\r
macroscopic spectral dimension is Ds = 4.\r
In the fixed point regime we have λ¯\r
k ∝ k\r
2\r
, and therefore F(p\r
2\r
) ∝ p\r
2\r
. As a result,\r
the exponent in (3.12) is proportional to p\r
4 now. This implies the T → 0−behavior\r
P(T) ∝ 1/T. It corresponds to the spectral dimension Ds = 2.\r
This result holds for all RG trajectories since only the fixed point properties were\r
used. In particular it is independent of λ¯\r
k0 on macroscopic scales. In fact, the above\r
assumption that hgµνik0is flat was not necessary for obtaining Ds = 2. This follows from\r
the fact that even for a curved metric the spectral sum (3.11) can be represented by an\r
Euler-Mac Laurin series which always implies (3.12) as the leading term for T → 0.\r
Thus we may conclude that on very small and very large length scales the spectral\r
dimensions of the QEG spacetimes are\r
Ds(T → ∞) = 4\r
Ds(T → 0) = 2 (3.13)\r
The dimensionality of the fractal realized at sub-Planckian distances is found to be\r
2 again. It is by no means trivial that Ds coincides with the value of 4 + η. While the\r
13

replacement of the classical p\r
2 F(p2\r
) = p\r
2 by p2 F(p2\r
) ∝ p\r
4\r
is reminiscent of the graviton\r
propagator argument of Section 2, it is important to emphasize that the value of 4 + η is\r
entirely determined by the running of Gk, while the spectral dimension was derived from\r
the k-dependence of the cosmological constant.\r
In fact, it is remarkable that the equality of 4 + η and Dsis a special feature of\r
4 classical dimensions. Generalizing for d classical dimensions, the fixed point running\r
of Newton’s constant becomes Gk ∝ k\r
2−d with a dimension-dependent exponent, while\r
λ¯\r
k ∝ k\r
2\r
continues to have a quadratic k-dependence. As a result, the Ge(k) of eq. (2.6)\r
is proportional to 1/pdin general so that, for any d, the 2-dimensional looking graviton\r
propagator (2.8) is obtained. (This is equivalent to saying that η = 2 − d, or d + η = 2,\r
for arbitrary d.)\r
On the other hand, the impact of the RG effects on the diffusion process is to replace\r
the operator ∆ by ∆2, for any d, since the cosmological constant always runs quadratically.\r
Hence, in the fixed point regime, eq. (3.12) becomes\r
P(T) ∝\r
Z\r
d\r
d\r
p exp \u0002−p\r
4 T\r
\u0003\r
∝ T\r
− d\r
4 (3.14)\r
This T-dependence implies the spectral dimension\r
Ds(d) = d\r
2\r
(3.15)\r
This value coincides with d + η if, and only if, d = 4. It is an intriguing speculation\r
that this could have something to do with the observed macroscopic dimensionality of\r
spacetime.\r
Up to this point, to be as concrete as possible, we formulated our argument within\r
the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. To complete the discussion we show that the exact (un\u0002truncated) theory if it has a NGFP implies the dynamical dimensional reduction from 4\r
to 2 dimensions (in d = 4) in exactly the same way as the truncated one.\r
The complete effective average action has the structure Γk[gµν ] = P\r
n\r
¯gn(k) In[gµν]\r
with infinitely many running couplings ¯gn(k) and diffeomorphism invariant functionals\r
14

In. If ¯gn(k) has the canonical dimension dn the corresponding dimensionless couplings are\r
gn(k) ≡ k\r
−dn ¯gn(k) and we have\r
Γk[gµν ] = X\r
n\r
gn(k) k\r
dn\r
In[gµν ] = X\r
n\r
gn(k) In[k\r
2\r
gµν ] (3.16)\r
In the second equality we used that In[c\r
2\r
gµν] = c\r
dn In[gµν] for any c > 0 since In has\r
dimension −dn.\r
If the theory is asymptotically safe at the exact level, all gn(k) approach constant\r
values gn∗ for k → ∞:\r
Γk→∞[gµν] = X\r
n\r
gn∗ In[k\r
2\r
gµν ] (3.17)\r
Obviously this functional depends on k\r
2 and gµν only via the combination k2\r
gµν . There\u0002fore the solutions of the corresponding field equation, hgµνik\r
, scale proportional to k\r
−2\r
.\r
Hence ∆(k) ∝ k\r
2\r
in the fixed point regime, and this is exactly the scaling behavior (3.7)\r
our above derivation of Ds(T → 0) = 2 was based upon.\r
This completes the demonstration that if a NGFP does exist in the full theory, its\r
exact spacetimes are fractals with Ds = 2 on sub-Planckian distances.\r
At this point it is tempting to compare the result (3.13) to the spectral dimensions\r
of the spacetime which were recently obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the causal\r
dynamical triangulation model [36]:\r
Ds(T → ∞) = 4.02 ± 0.1\r
Ds(T → 0) = 1.80 ± 0.25 (3.18)\r
These figures, too, suggest that the long-distance and short-distance spectral dimension\r
should be 4 and 2, respectively.\r
The dimensional reduction from 4 to 2 dimensions is a highly nontrivial dynamical\r
phenomenon which seems to occur in both QEG and the discrete triangulation model. We\r
find it quite remarkable that the discrete and the continuum approach lead to essentially\r
15

identical conclusions in this respect. We consider this agreement a first hint indicating that\r
(at least in 4 dimensions) the discrete model and QEG in the average action formulation\r
might describe the same physics. But clearly much more work is needed in order to\r
understand how the two approaches are related precisely.\r
4 Summary\r
The general picture of the spacetime structure in QEG which has emerged so far is\r
as follows. At sub-Planckian distances spacetime is a fractal of dimensionality Ds =\r
4 + η = 2. It can be thought of as a self-similar hierarchy of superimposed Riemannian\r
manifolds of any curvature. As one considers larger length scales where the RG running\r
of the gravitational parameters comes to a halt, the “ripples” in the spacetime gradually\r
disappear and the structure of a classical 4-dimensional manifold is recovered.\r
Within the Einstein-Hilbert approximation of QEG there are two natural ways of\r
defining an effective dimensionality of the fractal spacetime. We can either define it\r
as 4 + ηN as derived from the running of Newton’s constant, or we use the spectral\r
dimension implied by the k-dependence of the cosmological constant. We have seen\r
that both definitions lead to identical results on very large and very small distances.\r
We also showed that the microscopic dimensionality Ds = 2 is a rather direct and exact\r
consequence of asymptotic safety which does not rely on any approximation or truncation.\r
It is therefore not unlikely that the mechanism of a dynamical dimensional reduction\r
from 4 to 2 dimensions which occurs in QEG is the same phenomenon as the dimensional\r
reduction observed in the Monte Carlo studies of causal dynamical triangulations.\r

Abstract\r
Four-dimensional Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is likely to be an asymp\u0002totically safe theory which is applicable at arbitrarily small distance scales. On\r
sub-Planckian distances it predicts that spacetime is a fractal with an effective di\u0002mensionality of 2. The original argument leading to this result was based upon\r
the anomalous dimension of Newton’s constant. In the present paper we demon\u0002strate that also the spectral dimension equals 2 microscopically, while it is equal to\r
4 on macroscopic scales. This result is an exact consequence of asymptotic safety\r
and does not rely on any truncation. Contact is made with recent Monte Carlo\r
simulations."""

Soon after the detailed investigation of Quantum Einstein Gravity [1]-[17] had begun and\r
it had become clear that the theory is likely to be nonperturbatively renormalizable or\r
“asymptotically safe” [8, 3, 5, 6] it was observed [3, 5] that it predicts a fractal space\u0002time structure at sub-Planckian distances whose effective dimensionality equals 2. On\r
the technical side, a key tool in the nonperturbative investigation of Quantum Einstein\r
Gravity (QEG) was the effective average action and its associated exact renormalization\r
group (RG) equation which had been developed in [18, 19] and was first applied to gravity\r
in [1]. (For general reviews see [20],[21].)\r
In QEG, the effective average action Γk[gµν] defines an infinite set of effective field\r
theories, valid near a variable mass scale k which is introduced as an infrared (IR) cutoff\r
and varies between k = 0 and k = ∞ [1]. Intuitively speaking, the solution hgµνikof the\r
scale dependent field equation\r
δΓk\r
δgµν(x)\r
[hgi\r
k\r
] = 0 (1.1)\r
can be interpreted as the metric averaged over (Euclidean) spacetime volumes of a linear\r
extension ℓ which typically is of the order of 1/k. Knowing the scale dependence of Γk,\r
i.e. the renormalization group trajectory k 7→ Γk, we can in principle follow the solution\r
hgµνikfrom the ultraviolet (k → ∞) to the infrared (k → 0).\r
It is an important feature of this approach that the infinitely many equations of (1.1),\r
one for each scale k, are valid simultaneously. They all refer to the same physical system,\r
the “quantum spacetime”, but describe its effective metric structure on different scales.\r
An observer using a “microscope” with a resolution ≈ k\r
−1 will perceive the universe to be\r
a Riemannian manifold with metric hgµνik. At every fixed k, hgµνikis a smooth classical\r
metric. But since the quantum spacetime is characterized by the infinity of equations\r
(1.1) with k = 0, · · · , ∞ it can acquire very nonclassical and in particular fractal features.\r
Let us describe more precisely what it means to “average” over Euclidean spacetime\r
volumes. The quantity we can freely tune is the IR cutoff scale k, and the “resolving\r
1

power” of the microscope, henceforth denoted ℓ, is in general a complicated function of\r
k. (In flat space, ℓ ≈ 1/k.) In order to understand the relationship between ℓ and k we\r
must recall some steps from the construction of Γk[gµν] in ref. [1].\r
The effective average action is obtained by introducing an IR cutoff into the path\u0002integral over all metrics, gauge fixed by means of a background gauge fixing condition.\r
Even without a cutoff the resulting effective action Γ[gµν; ¯gµν] depends on two metrics,\r
the expectation value of the quantum field, gµν, and the background field ¯gµν . This is a\r
standard technique, and it is well known [23] that the functional Γ[gµν] ≡ Γ[gµν ; ¯gµν = gµν]\r
obtained by equating the two metrics can be used to generate the 1PI Green’s functions\r
of the theory.\r
The IR cutoff of the average action is implemented by first expressing the functional\r
integral over all metrics in terms of eigenmodes of D¯ 2, the covariant Laplacian formed with\r
the aid of the background metric ¯gµν. Then a suppression term is introduced which damps\r
the contribution of all −D¯ 2-modes with eigenvalues smaller than k"""

steps [20] this leads to the scale dependent functional Γk[gµν ; ¯gµν], and the action with\r
one argument again obtains by equating the two metrics: Γk[gµν ] ≡ Γk[gµν; ¯gµν = gµν].\r
It is this action which appears in (1.1). Because of the identification of the two metrics\r
we see that it is basically the eigenmodes of D¯ 2 = D2, constructed from the argument of\r
Γk[g], which are cut off at k"""

k\r
is the corresponding stationary point, we can\r
say that the metric hgµνikapplies to the situation where only the quantum fluctuations\r
of −D2(hgµν ik) with eigenvalues larger than k\r
2\r
are integrated out. Therefore there is a\r
complicated interrelation between the metric and the scale at which it provides an effective\r
description: The covariant Laplacian which ultimately decides about which modes are\r
integrated out is constructed from the “on shell” configuration hgµνik, so it is k-dependent\r
by itself already.\r
From these remarks it is clear now how to obtain the “resolving power” ℓ for a given\r
k, at least in principle. We take the Laplacian −D2(hgµνik), solve its eigenvalue problem,\r
and then analyze in particular the properties of the eigenfunction(s) with eigenvalue k\r
2\r
2

(or near k\r
2\r
in the case of a discrete spectrum). Loosely speaking, this eigenfunction is the\r
last one integrated out. As a consequence, the “averaging” scale is crucially determined\r
by “how fast” this eigenfunction varies over spacetime. Let us assume, for instance, this\r
eigenfunction is oscillatory with a coordinate period ∆x. Then, again by using hgµνik,\r
we compute the physical proper length this period corresponds to, and this is then what\r
determines the resolution ℓ.\r
In general the eigenfunction at k\r
2 will have a complicated x-dependence, and therefore\r
also the typical scales on which it varies are position dependent. Moreover, at a given\r
point, the scale of significant variation will be direction dependent (anisotropic). There\u0002fore the resolving power ℓ = ℓ(k; x, n) is a complicated function in general, depending\r
parametrically on points (x\r
µ\r
) and directions (n\r
µ\r
) on spacetime. It is clear that these\r
notions can be made precise only in concrete examples and must be defined on a case by\r
case basis.\r
We emphasize, however, that using the averaged metric itself to define the scale it is\r
averaged over is not a vicious circle, but rather is exactly as it must be in a background\r
independent approach to the quantization of gravity.\r
In a somewhat simplified form, the construction of a quantum spacetime within QEG\r
can be summarized as follows. We start from a fixed RG trajectory k 7→ Γk, derive its\r
effective field equations at each k, and solve them. The resulting quantum mechanical\r
counterpart of a classical spacetime is specified by the infinity of Riemannian metrics\r
{hgµνik|k = 0, · · · , ∞}. While the totality of these metrics contains all physical infor\u0002mation, the parameter k is only a book keeping device a priori. In a second step, it\r
can be given a physical interpretation by relating it to the (proper) length scale of the\r
averaging procedure: One constructs the Laplacian −D2(hgµνik), diagonalizes it, looks\r
how rapidly its k\r
2\r
-eigenfunction varies, and “measures” the length of typical variations\r
with the metric hgµν ikitself. By solving the resulting ℓ = ℓ(k) for k = k(ℓ) we can in\r
principle reinterprete the metric hgµν ikas referring to a microscope with a known position\r
and direction dependent resolving power. The price we have to pay for the background\r
3

independence is that we cannot freely choose ℓ directly but rather k only.\r
The first difficult step in this construction program consists in finding the RG trajec\u0002tories. The running action Γk[gµν ] is given by an exact functional RG equation [1]. In\r
practice it is usually solved on a truncated theory space. In the Einstein-Hilbert trunca\u0002tion, for instance, Γk is approximated by a functional of the form\r

k/k2 were first obtained in\r
[1]. Remarkably, they turned out to possess a simultaneous zero at a non-Gaussian fixed\r
point (NGFP) (g∗, λ∗) which has just the right properties needed for the nonperturbative\r
renormalizability of QEG along the lines of Weinberg’s [22] ideas on “asymptotic safety”\r
[8]. It was argued [3, 5, 6] that the NGFP is likely to exist also in the un-truncated, full\r
theory and allows for the construction of a consistent and predictive microscopic theory\r
of quantum gravity valid at arbitrarily small distances even.\r
One of the highly intriguing conclusions we reached in refs. [3, 5] was that the effective\r
dimensionality of spacetime is scale dependent. It equals 4 at macroscopic distances\r
(ℓ ≫ ℓPl) but, near ℓ ≈ ℓPl, it gets dynamically reduced to the value 2. For ℓ ≪ ℓPl\r
spacetime is, in a precise sense [3], a 2-dimensional fractal.\r
In ref. [24] the specific form of the graviton propagator on this fractal was applied in a\r
cosmological context. It was argued that it gives rise to a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of\r
primordial geometry fluctuations, perhaps responsible for the CMBR spectrum observed\r
today.\r
In refs. [24]-[32] various types of “RG improvements” were used to explore possible\r
manifestations of the scale dependence of the gravitational parameters.\r
Along a quite different line of investigation, considerable progress has been made\r
recently towards defining a quantum theory of gravity as the continuum limit of a discrete\r
4

model of statistical mechanics. Performing comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations within\r
the framework of causal (Lorentzian) triangulated geometries [33], Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz\r
and Loll [34]-[36] collected strong evidence indicating that these models can describe\r
universes which are extended both in space and time and are 4-dimensional on large\r
scales. In particular the above authors “measured” numerically the spectral and Hausdorff\r
dimensions of the spacetimes and their time slices, respectively. Remarkably, they, too,\r
find that the (spectral) dimension Ds of the spacetime reduces dynamically from Ds ≈ 4\r
at large distances to Ds ≈ 2 on small length scales.\r
While until recently it has been difficult to compare the continuum theory to the\r
discrete causal triangulation approach, the new Monte Carlo results suggest that they\r
might be closely related, possibly representing the same “universality class”.\r
In our original argument [3] we determined the effective dimensionality of the fractal\r
realized at sub-Planckian distances (in the asymptotic scaling regime of the NGFP) from\r
the anomalous dimension ηN at the NGFP. A priori this definition of an effective dimen\u0002sionality is different from the one used in the Monte Carlo simulations. It is the main\r
purpose of the present paper to apply the reasoning from [3, 5] to the definition of the\r
effective dimension which was employed by Ambjørn, Jurkiewicz and Loll [36], namely\r
the spectral dimension Ds.\r
We shall demonstrate that asymptotically safe QEG does indeed predict Ds = 4\r
at ℓ ≫ ℓPl and Ds = 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl. (The Planck length and mass are defined as\r
ℓPl ≡ m−1\r
Pl ≡ G(k = 0)1/2\r

For simplicity we use the Einstein-Hilbert truncation to start with, and we consider space\u0002times with classical dimensionality d = 4. The corresponding RG trajectories were com\u00025

pletely classified and determined numerically in [4]. The physically relevant ones, for\r
k → ∞, all approach the NGFP at (g∗, λ∗) so that the dimensionful quantities run ac\u0002cording to\r
Gk ≈ g∗/k2, λ¯\r
k ≈ λ∗ k\r
2\r
(2.1)\r
The behavior (2.1) is realized in the asymptotic scaling regime k ≫ mPl. Near k = mPl\r
the trajectories cross over towards the Gaussian fixed point at g = λ = 0, and then run\r
towards negative, vanishing, and positive values of λ, respectively.\r
Since in this paper we are interested only in the limiting cases of very small and\r
very large distances the following caricature of a RG trajectory will be sufficient. We\r
assume that Gk and λ¯\r
k behave as in (2.1) for k ≫ mPl, and that they assume constant\r
values for k ≪ mPl. The precise interpolation between the two regimes could be obtained\r
numerically [4] but will not be needed here.\r
The argument of ref. [5] concerning the fractal nature of the QEG spacetimes was\r
as follows. Within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation of theory space, the effective field\r
equations (1.1) happen to coincide with the ordinary Einstein equation, but with Gk and\r
λ¯\r
k replacing the classical constants. Without matter,\r
Rµν (hgik) = λ¯\r
k hgµν ik\r
(2.2)\r
Since in absence of dimensionful constants of integration λ¯\r
k is the only quantity in this\r
equation which sets a scale, every solution to (2.2) has a typical radius of curvature\r
rc(k) ∝ 1/\r
p\r
λ¯\r
k. (For instance, the maximally symmetric S\r
4\r
-solution has the radius\r
rc = r =\r
p\r
3/λ¯\r
k.) If we want to explore the spacetime structure at a fixed length scale\r
ℓ we should use the action Γk[gµν ] at k = 1/ℓ because with this functional a tree level\r
analysis is sufficient to describe the essential physics at this scale, including the relevant\r
quantum effects. Hence, when we observe the spacetime with a microscope of resolution\r
ℓ, we will see an average radius of curvature given by rc(ℓ) ≡ rc(k = 1/ℓ). Once ℓ is\r
smaller than the Planck length ℓPl ≡ m−1\r
Pl we are in the fixed point regime where λ¯\r
k ∝ k\r
2\r
6

so that rc(k) ∝ 1/k, or\r
rc(ℓ) ∝ ℓ (2.3)\r
Thus, when we look at the structure of spacetime with a microscope of resolution ℓ ≪ ℓPl,\r
the average radius of curvature which we measure is proportional to the resolution itself.\r
If we want to probe finer details and decrease ℓ we automatically decrease rc and hence\r
increase the average curvature. Spacetime seems to be more strongly curved at small\r
distances than at larger ones. The scale-free relation (2.3) suggests that at distances\r
below the Planck length the QEG spacetime is a special kind of fractal with a self-similar\r
structure. It has no intrinsic scale because in the fractal regime, i.e. when the RG\r
trajectory is still close to the NGFP, the parameters which usually set the scales of the\r
gravitational interaction, G and λ¯, are not yet “frozen out”. This happens only later on,\r
somewhere half way between the non-Gaussian and the Gaussian fixed point, at a scale\r
of the order of mPl.\r
Below this scale, Gk and λ¯\r
k stop running and, as a result, rc(k) becomes independent\r
of k so that rc(ℓ) = const for ℓ ≫ ℓPl. In this regime hgµνikis k-independent, indicating\r
that the macroscopic spacetime is describable by a single smooth, classical Riemannian\r
manifold.\r
The above argument made essential use of the proportionality ℓ ∝ 1/k. In the fixed\r
point regime it follows trivially from the fact that there exist no relevant dimensionful\r
parameters so that 1/k is the only length scale one can form. The algorithm for the\r
determination of ℓ(k) described in the Introduction yields the same answer.\r
It is easy to make the k-dependence of hgµν ikexplicit. Picking an arbitrary reference\r
scale k0 we may rewrite (2.2) as [λ¯\r
k0/λ¯k] Rµ\r
ν\r
(hgik) = λ¯\r
k0\r
δ\r
µ\r
ν\r
. Since Rµ\r
ν\r
(c g) = c\r
−1 Rµ\r
ν\r
(g)\r
for any constant c > 0, this relation implies that the average metric scales as\r
hgµν(x)ik = [λ¯\r
k0/λ¯k]hgµν(x)ik0\r
(2.4)\r
and its inverse according to\r
hg\r
µν(x)ik = [λ¯\r
k/λ¯k0\r
]hg\r
µν(x)ik0\r
(2.5)\r
7

These relations are valid provided the family of solutions considered exists for all scales\r
between k0 and k, and λ¯\r
k has the same sign always.\r
As we discussed in ref. [3] the QEG spacetime has an effective dimensionality which\r
is k-dependent and hence noninteger in general. Our discussion in [3] was based upon\r
the anomalous dimension ηN of the operator R √g R. It is defined as ηN ≡ −k ∂k ln ZNk\r
where ZNk ∝ 1/Gk is the wavefunction renormalization of the metric [1]. In a sense\r
which we shall make more precise in a moment, the effective dimensionality of spacetime\r
equals 4 + ηN . The RG trajectories of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation (within its domain\r
of validity) have ηN ≈ 0 for k → 0\r
1 and ηN ≈ −2 for k → ∞, the smooth change by\r
two units occuring near k ≈ mPl. As a consequence, the effective dimensionality is 4 for\r
ℓ ≫ ℓPl and 2 for ℓ ≪ ℓPl.\r
In fact, the UV fixed point has an anomalous dimension η ≡ ηN (g∗, λ∗) = −2. We\r
can use this information in order to determine the momentum dependence of the dressed\r
graviton propagator for momenta p\r

This form of the propagator is well known from the theory of critical phenomena, for\r
instance. (In the latter case it applies to large distances.) Eq. (2.7) is not valid directly\r
at the NGFP. For d = 4 and η = −2 the dressed propagator is Ge(p) = 1/p4 which has the\r
following representation in position space:\r
G(x; y) = −\r

ln (µ |x − y|) . (2.8)\r
Here µ is an arbitrary constant with the dimension of a mass. Obviously (2.8) has the\r
same form as a 1/p2-propagator in 2 dimensions.\r
Slightly away from the NGFP, before other physical scales intervene, the propagator is\r
of the familiar type (2.7) which shows that the quantity ηN has the standard interpretation\r
of an anomalous dimension in the sense that fluctuation effects modify the decay properties\r
of G so as to correspond to a spacetime of effective dimensionality 4 + ηN .\r
Thus the properties of the RG trajectories imply a remarkable dimensional reduction:\r

The fictitious diffusion process takes place on a “manifold” which, at every fixed scale,\r
is described by a smooth Riemannian metric hgµν ik. While the situation appears to be\r
classical at fixed k, nonclassical features emerge in the regime with nontrivial RG running\r
since there the metric depends on the scale at which the spacetime structure is probed.\r
The nonclassical features are encoded in the properties of the diffusion operator. De\u0002noting the covariant Laplacians corresponding to the metrics hgµνik\r

have that hO(γµν)i ≈ O(hgµν ik) if the operator O involves typical covariant momenta of\r
the order k and hgµνiksolves eq. (1.1). In the following we exploit this relationship for\r
the RHS of the diffusion equation, O = ∆γ Kγ(x, x′; T). It is crucial here to correctly\r
identify the relevant scale k.\r
If the diffusion process involves (approximately) only a small interval of scales near k\r
over which λ¯\r

dealing with a single-scale problem. In the usual spirit of effective field theories we would\r
then identify k\r
2 = EN as the relevant scale at which the running couplings are to be\r
evaluated.\r
However, in general the Cn’s are different from zero over a wide range of eigenvalues.\r
In this case we face a multiscale problem where different modes φn probe the spacetime\r
on different length scales.\r
If ∆(k0) corresponds to flat space, say, the eigenfunctions φn ≡ φp are plane waves\r
with momentum p\r

in terms of the eigenvalue En ≡ Ep = p\r

the resolution is ℓ ≈ 1/\r

En. This suggests that\r
when the manifold is probed by a mode with eigenvalue En it “sees” the metric hgµνikfor\r
the scale k =\r

En. Actually the identification k =\r
√\r
En is correct also for curved space\r
since, in the construction of Γk, the parameter k is introduced precisely as a cutoff in the\r
spectrum of the covariant Laplacian.\r
Therefore we conclude that under the spectral sum of (3.10) we must use the scale\r
k\r
2 = En which depends explicitly on the resolving power of the corresponding mode.\r

propagator argument of Section 2, it is important to emphasize that the value of 4 + η is\r
entirely determined by the running of Gk, while the spectral dimension was derived from\r
the k-dependence of the cosmological constant.\r
In fact, it is remarkable that the equality of 4 + η and Dsis a special feature of\r
4 classical dimensions. Generalizing for d classical dimensions, the fixed point running\r
of Newton’s constant becomes Gk ∝ k\r
2−d with a dimension-dependent exponent, while\r

propagator (2.8) is obtained. (This is equivalent to saying that η = 2 − d, or d + η = 2,\r
for arbitrary d.)\r
On the other hand, the impact of the RG effects on the diffusion process is to replace\r
the operator ∆ by ∆2, for any d, since the cosmological constant always runs quadratically.\r

This value coincides with d + η if, and only if, d = 4. It is an intriguing speculation\r
that this could have something to do with the observed macroscopic dimensionality of\r

Up to this point, to be as concrete as possible, we formulated our argument within\r
the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. To complete the discussion we show that the exact (un\u0002truncated) theory if it has a NGFP implies the dynamical dimensional reduction from 4\r
to 2 dimensions (in d = 4) in exactly the same way as the truncated one.\r
The complete effective average action has the structure Γk[gµν ] = P\r

Hence ∆(k) ∝ k\r

At this point it is tempting to compare the result (3.13) to the spectral dimensions\r
of the spacetime which were recently obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the causal\r
dynamical triangulation model [36]:\r
Ds(T → ∞) = 4.02 ± 0.1\r
Ds(T → 0) = 1.80 ± 0.25 (3.18)\r
These figures, too, suggest that the long-distance and short-distance spectral dimension\r
should be 4 and 2, respectively.\r
The dimensional reduction from 4 to 2 dimensions is a highly nontrivial dynamical\r
phenomenon which seems to occur in both QEG and the discrete triangulation model. We\r
find it quite remarkable that the discrete and the continuum approach lead to essentially\r
15

identical conclusions in this respect. We consider this agreement a first hint indicating that\r
(at least in 4 dimensions) the discrete model and QEG in the average action formulation\r
might describe the same physics. But clearly much more work is needed in order to\r
understand how the two approaches are related precisely."""

The general picture of the spacetime structure in QEG which has emerged so far is\r
as follows. At sub-Planckian distances spacetime is a fractal of dimensionality Ds =\r
4 + η = 2. It can be thought of as a self-similar hierarchy of superimposed Riemannian\r
manifolds of any curvature. As one considers larger length scales where the RG running\r
of the gravitational parameters comes to a halt, the “ripples” in the spacetime gradually\r
disappear and the structure of a classical 4-dimensional manifold is recovered.\r
Within the Einstein-Hilbert approximation of QEG there are two natural ways of\r
defining an effective dimensionality of the fractal spacetime. We can either define it\r
as 4 + ηN as derived from the running of Newton’s constant, or we use the spectral\r
dimension implied by the k-dependence of the cosmological constant. We have seen\r
that both definitions lead to identical results on very large and very small distances.\r
We also showed that the microscopic dimensionality Ds = 2 is a rather direct and exact\r
consequence of asymptotic safety which does not rely on any approximation or truncation.\r
It is therefore not unlikely that the mechanism of a dynamical dimensional reduction\r
from 4 to 2 dimensions which occurs in QEG is the same phenomenon as the dimensional\r
reduction observed in the Monte Carlo studies of causal dynamical triangulations.\r
