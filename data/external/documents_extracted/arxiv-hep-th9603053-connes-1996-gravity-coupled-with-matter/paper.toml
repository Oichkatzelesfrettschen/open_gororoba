Gravity coupled with matter and the\r
foundation of non commutative geometry\r
Alain CONNES\r
I.H.E.S., 91440 Bures-sur-Yvette, France\r
Abstract. We first exhibit in the commutative case the simple al\u0002gebraic relations between the algebra of functions on a manifold and\r
its infinitesimal length element ds. Its unitary representations cor\u0002respond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while ds is the\r
Dirac propagator ds=×—×=D\r
−1 where\r
D is the Dirac operator.\r
We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using\r
Tomita’s involutionJ. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a\r
function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to\r
the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown\r
(in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian\r
coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative\r
geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic\r
sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non\r
commutative case. The group of local gauge transformations appears\r
spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the diffeomorphism group.\r
Riemann’s concept of a geometric space is based on the notion of a manifold\r
M whose pointsx∈M are locally labelled by a finite number of real coordinates\r
x\r
µ\r
∈R. The metric data is given by the infinitesimal length element,\r
(1) ds\r
2\r
=gµν dx\r
µ\r
dx\r
ν\r
which allows to measure distances between two points x, y as the infimum of the 1

length of arcs x(t) from x to y,\r
(2) d(x, y) = Inf Z y\r
x\r
ds .\r
In this paper we shall build our notion of geometry, in a very similar but somehow\r
dual manner, on the pair (A, ds) of the algebra A of coordinates and the infinite\u0002simal length element ds. For the start we only consider ds as a symbol, which\r
together with A generates an algebra (A, ds). The length element ds does not\r
commute with the coordinates, i.e. with the functions f on our space, f ∈ A.\r
But it does satisfy non trivial relations. Thus in the simplest case where A is\r
commutative we shall have,\r
(3) \u0002[f, ds−1], g\u0003= 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A .\r
The only other relation between ds and A is of degree n in ds−1 = D and expresses\r
the homological nature of the volume form (see axiom 4 below). When A is\r
commutative it has a spectrum, namely the space of algebra preserving maps from\r
A to the complex numbers,\r
(4) χ : A → C ; χ(a + b) = χ(a) + χ(b) , χ(ab) = χ(a) χ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A ,\r
χ(λa) = λ χ(a) ∀ λ ∈ C , ∀ a ∈ A .\r
For instance, when A is the algebra of functions on a space M the space of such\r
maps, called characters of A identifies with M. To each point x ∈ M corresponds\r
the character χx,\r
(5) χx(f) = f(x) ∀ f ∈ A .\r
While relations such as (3) between the algebra A and the length element ds hold at\r
the universal level, a specific geometry will be specified as a unitary representation\r
of the algebra generated by A and ds. In general we shall deal with complex valued\r
functions f so that A will be endowed with an involution,\r
(6) f → f\r
∗\r
which is just complex conjugation of functions in the usual case,\r
(7) f\r
∗\r
(x) = f(x) ∀ x ∈ M .\r
2

The length element ds will be selfadjoint,\r
(8) ds∗ = ds\r
so that (ds)\r
2 will be automatically positive.\r
The unitarity of the representation just means that the operator π(a\r
∗\r
) correspon\u0002ding to a\r
∗\r
is the adjoint of the operator π(a),\r
(9) π(a\r
∗\r
) = π(a)\r
∗ ∀ a ∈ (A, ds).\r
Given a unitary representation π of (A, ds) we measure the distance between two\r
points x, y of our space by,\r
(10) d(x, y) = Sup \b|f(x) − f(y)| ; f ∈ A , k[f, ds−1]k ≤ 1\r
\t\r
where we dropped the letter π but where the representation π has been used in a\r
crucial way to define the norm of [f, ds−1].\r
Before we proceed let us first explain what representation of (A, ds) corresponds\r
to an ordinary Riemannian geometry, and check that (10) gives us back exactly\r
the Riemannian geodesic distance of formula (2). The algebra A is the algebra of\r
smooth complex valued functions on M, A = C∞(M) and we choose to represent\r
ds as the propagator for fermions which physicists write in a suggestive ways as\r
×—×. This means that we represent A in the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
(M, S) of square\r
integrable sections of the spinor bundle on M by the following formula,\r
(11) (f ξ)(x) = f(x) ξ(x) ∀ f ∈ A = C\r
∞(M) , ∀ ξ ∈ H = L2\r
(M, S)\r
and we represent ds by the formula,\r
(12) ds = D−1, D =\r
1\r
√\r
−1\r
γ\r
µ ∇µ\r
where D is the Dirac operator. We ignore the ambiguity of (12) on the kernel of\r
D.\r
One checks immediately that the commutator [D, f], for f ∈ A = C∞(M) is\r
the Clifford multiplication by the gradient ∇f so that its operator norm, in H =\r
L\r
2\r
(M, S), is given by\r
(13) k[D, f]k = Sup\r
x∈M\r
k∇fk .\r
3

It then follows by integration along the path from x to y that |f(x) − f(y)| ≤\r
length of path, provided (13) is bounded by 1. Thus the equality between (10)\r
and (2).\r
Note that while ds has the dimension of a length, (ds)\r
−1 which is represented by\r
D has the dimension of a mass. The formula (10) is dual to formula (2). In the\r
usual Riemannian case it gives the same answer but being dual it does not use\r
arcs connecting x with y but rather functions from M to C. As we shall see this\r
will allow to treat spaces with a finite number of points on the same footing as the\r
continuum. Another virtue of formula (10) is that it will continue to make sense\r
when the algebra A is no longer commutative.\r
In this paper we shall write down the axioms of geometry as the presentation of\r
the algebraic relations between A and ds and the representation of those relations\r
in Hilbert space.\r
In order to compare different geometries, i.e. different representations of the alge\u0002bra (A, ds) generated by A and ds, we shall use the following action functional,\r
(14) Trace \u0012ϕ\r
\u0012\r
ds\r
ℓp\r
\u0013\u0013\r
where ℓp is the Planck length and ϕ is a suitable cutoff function which will cut off\r
all eigenvalues of ds larger than ℓp.\r
We shall show in [CC] that for a suitable choice of the algebra A, the above\r
action will give Einstein gravity coupled with the Lagrangian of the standard\r
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) model of Glashow Weinberg Salam. The algebra will not\r
be C∞(M) with M a (compact) 4-manifold but a non commutative refinement\r
of it which has to do with the quantum group refinement of the Spin covering of\r
SO(4),\r
(15) 1 → Z/2 → Spin(4) → SO(4) → 1 .\r
Amazingly, in this description the group of gauge transformations of the matter\r
fields arises spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the generalized diffeomorphism\r
group Aut(A).\r
It is the non commutativity of the algebra A which gives for free the group of\r
gauge transformations of matter fields as a (normal) subgroup of the group of dif\u0002feomorphisms. Indeed, when A = C∞(M) is the commutative algebra of smooth\r
4

functions on M one easily checks that the following defines a one to one corre\u0002spondence between diffeomorphisms ϕ of M and the automorphisms α ∈ Aut(A)\r
of the algebra A (preserving the ∗),\r
(16) α(f) (x) = f(ϕ\r
−1\r
(x)) ∀ x ∈ M , f ∈ C\r
∞(M).\r
In the non commutative case an algebra always has automorphisms, the inner\r
automorphisms given by\r
(17) αu(f) = u f u∗ ∀ f ∈ A\r
for any element of the unitary group U of A,\r
(18) U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u\r
∗ u = 1} .\r
The subgroup Int(A) ⊂ Aut(A) of inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup\r
and it will provide us with our group of internal gauge transformations. It is a\r
happy coincidence that the two terminologies : inner automorphisms and internal\r
symmetries actually match. Both groups will have to be lifted to the spinors\r
but we shall see that later. We shall see that the action of inner automorphisms\r
on the metric gives rise to internal fluctuations of the latter which replace D by\r
D + A + J A J−1(see below) and give exactly the gauge bosons of the standard\r
model, with its symmetry breaking Higgs sector, when we apply it to the above\r
finite geometry. We had realized in [Co2] that the fermions were naturally in the\r
adjoint representation of the unitary group U in the case of the standard model,\r
i.e. that the action of U on H was,\r
ξ → u J u J−1ξ = u ξ u∗.\r
But we had not understood the significance of the inner automorphisms as in\u0002ternal diffeomorphisms of the non commutative space. What the present paper\r
shows is that one should consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the\r
diffeomorphism group of the non commutative geometry and the gauge bosons as\r
the internal fluctuations of the metric. We should thus expect that the action\r
functional should be of purely gravitational nature. The above spectral action\r
when restricted to these special metrics will give the interaction Lagrangian of\r
the bosons. The interaction with Fermions, which has the right hypercharge as\u0002signement is obtained directly from hψ, Dψi (with D +A+J A J−1\r
instead of D),\r
5

and is thus also of spectral nature being invariant under the full unitary group of\r
operators in Hilbert space. Thus the only distinction that remains between matter\r
and gravity is the distinction Int A 6= Aut A which vanishes for a number of highly\r
non commutative algebras.\r
Quantized calculus.\r
In order to ease the presentation of our axioms let us recall the first few lines of the\r
dictionary of the quantized calculus which makes use of the formalism of quantum\r
mechanics to formulate a new theory of infinitesimals. The first two lines of this\r
dictionary are just the traditional way of interpreting the observables in quantum\r
mechanics,\r
Classical Quantum\r
Complex variable Operator in Hilbert space\r
Real variable Selfadjoint operator, T = T\r
∗\r
Infinitesimal variable Compact operator\r
Infinitesimal of order α µn(T) = 0(n\r
−α)\r
Integral R− T = log divergence of the trace of T\r
We recall briefly that an operator T in Hilbert space is compact iff for any ε > 0\r
one has kTk < ε except on a finite dimensional subspace of H. More precisely\r
(19) ∀ ε there exists a finite dimensional subspace E of H\r
such that kT/E⊥k < ε where E\r
⊥ is the orthogonal of E .\r
The size of a compact operator T is measured by the decreasing sequence µn of\r
eigenvalues of |T| =\r
√\r
T ∗ T. The order of such an “infinitesimal” is measured by\r
the rate at which these characteristic values µn(T) converge to 0 when n → ∞.\r
One can show that all the intuitive rules of calculus are valid, e.g. the order of\r
T1+T2 or of T1 T2 are as they should be (≤ α1∨α2 and α1 α2). Moreover the trace\r
(i.e. the sum of the eigenvalues) is logarithmically divergent for infinitesimals of\r
order 1, since µn(T) = 0 \r
1\r
n\r
\u0001\r
. It is a quite remarkable fact that the coefficient\r
of the logarithmic divergency does yield an additive trace which in essence eva\u0002luates the “classical part” of such infinitesimals. This trace, denoted R\r
− vanishes\r
on infinitesimals of order α > 1.\r
The only rule of the naive calculus of infinitesimals which is not fulfilled is com\u0002mutativity but this lack of commutativity is crucial to allow the coexistence of\r
variables with continuous range with infinitesimals which have discrete spectrum.\r
6

We refer to [Co] for more details on this calculus and its applications.\r
Axioms for commutative geometry.\r
Let us now proceed and write down the axioms for commutative geometry. The\r
small modifications required for the non commutative case will only be handled\r
later.\r
Thus H is a Hilbert space, A an involutive algebra represented in H and D = ds−1\r
is a selfadjoint operator in H.\r
We are given an integer n which controls the dimension of our space by the con\u0002dition,\r
1) ds = D−1is an infinitesimal of order 1\r
n\r
.\r
The universal commutation relation (3) is represented by\r
2) [[D, f], g] = 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A.\r
We assume that the simple commutation with |D|, δ(T) = [|D|, T] will only yield\r
bounded operators when we start with any f ∈ A. More precisely we assume that:\r
3) (Smoothness) For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m.\r
This axiom 3 is the algebraic formulation of smoothness of the coordinates.\r
The next axiom is depending upon the parity of n, thus let us state it first when\r
n is even. It yields the γ5 matrix which is abstracted here as a Z/2 grading of the\r
Hilbert space H :\r
4) (Orientability) (n even) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A) such that\r
π(c) = γ satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γD = −Dγ .\r
In the odd case (n odd) one just asks that 1 = π(c) for some n-dimensional\r
Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A).\r
We need to explain briefly what is a Hochschild cycle. Conceptually it is the\r
algebraic formulation of a differential form, so that axiom 4 is really providing us\r
with the volume form. Concretely an n-dimensional Hochschild cycle is a finite\r
sum of elements of A ⊗ A ⊗ . . . ⊗ A (with n + 1 times A),\r
c =\r
X\r
j\r
a\r
0\r
j ⊗ a\r
1\r
j ⊗ a\r
2\r
j\r
. . . ⊗ a\r

such that the contraction bc = 0 where by definition b is linear and satisfies\r
b(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an\r
) = a\r
0\r
a\r
1 ⊗ a2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an − a0 ⊗ a1\r

a\r
k+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an + . . . + (−1)n\r
a\r
n\r
a\r
0 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an−1\r
.\r
When A is commutative it is easy to construct a Hochschild cycle, it suffices to\r
take any a\r
j and consider\r
c =\r
Xε(σ) a\r
0 ⊗ aσ(1) ⊗ aσ(2) ⊗ . . . ⊗ aσ(n)\r
where the sum runs over all the permutations σ of {1, . . ., n}.\r
This special construction corresponds to the familiar differential form a\r
0da1∧da2∧\r
. . . ∧ dan but does not require the previous knowledge of the tangent bundle.\r
Finally π(c) is the representation of c on H induced by\r
π(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an\r
) = a\r
0\r
[D, a1] . . . [D, an] .\r
To understand the meaning of axiom 4 let us take its simplest instance, with n = 1\r
and A = C∞(S\r
1\r
) generated by a single unitary element U ∈ A, U U∗ = U\r
∗ U = 1.\r
Let c = U\r
−1⊗U one checks that bc = U−1 U −U U −1 = 0 so that c is a Hochschild\r
cycle, c ∈ Z\r
1\r
(A, A). Then the condition π(c) = 1 reads:\r
[D, U] = U .\r
The reader will check at this point that this relation alone completely describes\r
the geometry of the circle, by computing explicitly the distance between points\r
using formula (10). One finds the usual metric on the circle with length 2π.\r
The next axiom will be the axiom of finiteness,\r
5) (Finiteness and absolute continuity.) Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ =\r
∩\r
m\r
Domain Dm is finite and projective. Moreover the following equality defines a\r
hermitian structure ( , ) on this module,\r
ha ξ, ηi = f a(ξ, η) dsn ∀ a ∈ A , ∀ ξ, η ∈ H∞ .\r
We recall from [Co] that a hermitian structure on a finite projective A-module is\r
given by an A-valued inner product. The prototype of such a module with inner\r
product is the following, one lets e ∈ ProjMq(A) be a selfadjoint idempotent,\r
e = e\r
∗\r
, e2 = e\r
8

and one lets E be the left module An e = {(ξj )j=1,...,n ; ξj ∈ A , ξj ejk = ξk} where\r
the action of A is given by left multiplication,\r
(a ξ)j = a ξj ∀ j = 1, . . ., n .\r
The A-valued inner product is then given by:\r
(ξ, η) = Σ ξi η\r
∗\r
i\r
.\r
It follows from axiom 4) and from a general theorem ([Co]) that the operators a dsn,\r
a ∈ A are measurable (cf. [Co]) so that the coefficient R− a dsn of the logarithmic\r
divergence of their trace is unambiguously defined.\r
It follows from axiom 5) that the algebra A is uniquely determined inside its weak\r
closure A′′ (which is also the bicommutant of A in H) by the equality\r
A = {T ∈ A′′ ; T ∈ ∩\r
m>0\r
Dom δ\r
m} .\r
This shows that the whole geometric data (A, H, D) is in fact uniquely determined\r
by the triple (A′′, H, D) where A′′ is a commutative von Neumann algebra.\r
This also shows that A is a pre C\r
∗ algebra, i.e. that it is stable under the C∞\r
functional calculus in the C\r
∗ algebra norm closure of A, A = A. Since we assumed\r
that A was commutative, so is A and by Gelfand’s theorem A = C(X) is the\r
algebra of continuous complex valued functions on X = Spectrum (A). We note\r
finally that characters χ of A extend automatically to A by continuity so that\r
Spectrum A = Spectrum A .\r
We let Ki(A), i = 0, 1 be the K-groups of A (or equivalently of A or of X). Thus\r
K0(A) classifies finite projective modules over A (or equivalently vector bundles\r
over X). Similarly K1(A) is the group of connected components of GL∞(A), i.e.\r
K1(A) = π0 GL∞(A), while by the Bott periodicity theorem one has,\r
πn(GL∞(A)) ∼= Kn+1(A)\r
where n + 1 only matters modulo 2.\r
One easily defines the index pairing of the operator D with Kn(A) where again\r
n only matters modulo 2. In the even case one uses γ to decompose D as D =\r
D+ + D− where D+ = (1 − p) Dp, p =\r
1+γ\r
2\r
. Then for any selfadjoint idempotent\r
9

e ∈ A the operator e D+ e is a Fredholm operator from the subspace e p H of H to\r
the subspace e(1 − p)H. This extends immediately to projections e ∈ Mq(A) for\r
some integer q, and gives an additive map from K0(A) to Z denoted hInd D, ei. A\r
similar discussion applies in the odd case ([]).\r
Since A is commutative we have the diagonal map,\r
A ⊗ A m−→ A , m(x ⊗ y) = xy ∀ x, y ∈ A\r
which yields a corresponding map m∗ : K∗(A) × K∗(A) → K∗(A). Composing\r
this map with Ind D we obtain the intersection form,\r
K∗(A) × K∗(A) → Z,\r
(e, f) → hInd D , m∗(e ⊗ f)i.\r
It clearly only depends upon the stable homotopy class of the representation π and\r
thus gives a very rough information on π. We shall assume, (Poincar´e duality)\r
6) The intersection form K∗(A) × K∗(A) → Z is invertible.\r
If one wants to take in account the possible presence of torsion in the K-groups\r
one should formulate Poincar´e duality as the isomorphism,\r
K∗(A)\r
∩µ\r
−→ K∗(A)\r
given by the Kasparov intersection product with the class µ of the Fredholm\r
module (H, D, γ) over A ⊗ A. We refer to [Co] [C] for the detailed formulation,\r
but 6) will suffice for theorem 1 below.\r
Thanks to the work of D. Sullivan [S] one knows that the above Poincar´e duality\r
isomorphism in K theory is (in the simply connected case and ignoring 2-torsion)\r
a characterization of the homotopy type of spaces which possess a structure of\r
smooth manifold. This requires the use of real K theory instead of the above\r
complex K theory and our last axiom will be precisely the existence of such a real\r
structure on our cycle.\r
7) Reality. There exists an antilinear isometry J : H → H such that J a J−1 =\r
a\r
∗ ∀ a ∈ A and J2 = ε, J D = ε′ D J and J γ = ε′′ γ J where ε, ε′\r
, ε′′ ∈\r
{−1, +1} are given by the following table from the value of n modulo 8,\r
10

ε\r
′ 1 −1 1 1 1 −1 1 1\r
ε\r
′′ 1 −1 1 −1\r
We can now state our first result,\r
Theorem. Let A = C∞(M) where M is a smooth compact manifold of dimension\r
n. a) Let π be a unitary representation of (A, ds) satisfying the above seven ax\u0002ioms, then there exists a unique Riemannian metric g on M such that the geodesic\r
distance between any two points x, y ∈ M is given by\r
d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} .\r
b) The metric g = g(π) only depends upon the unitary equivalence class of π and\r
the fibers of the map : π → g(π) from unitary equivalence classes to metrics form\r
a finite collection of affine space Aσ parametrized by the Spin structures σ on M.\r
c) The action functional R− dsn−2is a positive quadratic form on each Aσ with a\r
unique minimum πσ.\r
d) πσ is the representation of (A, ds) in L\r
2\r
(M, Sσ) given by multiplication opera\u0002tors and the Dirac operator of the Levi Civita Spin connection.\r
e) The value of R− dsn−2 on πσ is given by the Einstein Hilbert action,\r

\u0010n\r
2\r
+ 1\u0011−1\r
2\r
[n/2]\r
.\r
Let us make a few remarks about this theorem.\r
1) Note first that none of the axioms uses the fact that A is the algebra of smooth\r
functions on a manifold. In fact one should deduce from the axioms that the\r
spectrum X of A is a smooth manifold and that the map X → R\r
N , given by\r
the finite collection a\r
i\r
j\r
of elements of A involved in the Hochschild cycle c of\r
axiom 4, is actually a smooth embedding of X as a submanifold of R\r
N . To\r
prove this one should use [Co], proposition 15, p.312.\r
11

2) The two axioms 2 and 3 should be considered as the presentation of the\r
algebra (A, ds). Thus this presentation involves an explicit Hochschild n\u0002cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A) and for n odd gives the relation,\r
Σ a\r
j\r
0\r
[D, aj\r
1\r
] . . . [D, aj\r
n\r
] = 1 .\r
In the even case the relations are D γ = −γ D and γ\r
2 = 1, γ = γ∗\r
, with\r
γ = Σ a\r
j\r
0\r
[D, aj\r
1\r
] . . . [D, aj\r
u\r
] .\r
It is thus natural to fix c as part of the data. The differential form on M =\r
Spectrum A associated to the Hochschild n-cycle c is equal to the volume form\r
of the metric g. Thus fixing c determines the volume form of the metric.\r
3) The sign in front of the Einstein Hilbert action given in (a) is the correct\r
one for the Euclidean formulation of gravity and for instance in the n = 4\r
dimensional case the Einstein Hilbert action becomes the area\r
ℓ\r
−2\r
p\r
R\r
− ds2\r
of our space, in units of Planck length ℓp. Thus the only negative sign in the\r
second derivative of R− ds2 around flat space comes from the Weyl factor which\r
is determined by the choice of c. We refer to [K] and [KW] for the detailed\r
calculation.\r
4) When M is a Spin manifold the map π → g(π) is surjective and if we fix c it\r
surjects to the metrics g with fixed volume form. (This amounts to checking\r
that all axioms are fulfilled.)\r
5) If we drop axiom 7 there is a completely similar result as theorem 1 where\r
Spin is replaced by Spinc(cf. [ML]) and where uniqueness is lost in c) and\r
the minimum of the action f dsn−2is reached on a linear subspace of Aσ with\r
σ a fixed Spincstructure. The elements of this subspace correspond exactly\r
to the U(1) gauge potentials involved in the Spinc Dirac operator and d) e)\r
continue to hold.\r
6) A commutative geometry (A, H, D) is connected iff the only operators com\u0002muting with A and D are the scalars, i.e. iff the representation π of (A, ds)\r
in H is irreducible.\r
The axioms for non commutative geometry.\r
12

We are now ready to proceed to the non commutative case, i.e. where we no\r
longer assume that the algebra A is commutative. Among the axioms we wrote 1)\r
3) 5) will remain unchanged while the others will be slightly modified. One of the\r
most significant results of the theory of operator algebras is Tomita’s theorem [Ta]\r
which asserts that for any weakly closed ∗ algebra of operators M in Hilbert space\r
H which admits a cyclic and separating vector, there exists a canonical antilinear\r
isometric involution J from H to H such that\r
J M J−1 = M′\r
where M′ = {T ; T a = a T ∀ a ∈ M} is the commutant of M. It follows then\r
that M is antiisomorphic to its commutant, the antiisomorphism being given by\r
the C-linear map,\r
a ∈ M → J a∗ J\r
−1 ∈ M′\r
.\r
Now axiom 7 already involves an antilinear isometry J in H, which in the usual\r
geometric case is the charge conjugation. Since we assumed that A was commu\u0002tative the equality J a∗ J\r
−1 = a of axiom 7 is compatible with Tomita’s antiiso\u0002morphism. In general we shall replace the requirement J a∗ J\r
−1 = a ∀ a ∈ A of\r
axiom 7 by the following,\r
7\r
′\r
) One has [a, b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A where b\r
0 = J b∗ J−1\r
(and [a, b0] is the commu\u0002tator ab0 − b\r
0a).\r
Otherwise we leave 7) unchanged. This immediately turns the Hilbert space H\r
into a module over the algebra A ⊗ A0 which is the tensor product of A by its\r
opposite algebra A0. One lets,\r
(a ⊗ b\r
0\r
) ξ = a J b∗ J\r
−1\r
ξ ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
(One can use equivalently the terminology of bimodules or correspondences (cf.\r
[Co]).)\r
Thus axiom (7′) now gives a KR-homology class for the algebra A ⊗ A0endowed\r
with the antilinear automorphism,\r
τ (x ⊗ y\r
0\r
) = y\r
∗ ⊗ x∗0 ∀ x, y ∈ A\r
and we do not need the diagonal map m : A ⊗ A → A (which is an algebra\r
homomorphism only in the commutative case) to formulate Poincar´e duality,\r
13

(6′\r
) The cup product by µ ∈ KRn(A ⊗ A0) is an isomorphism\r
K∗(A)\r
∩µ\r
−→ K∗(A).\r
We also note that the intersection form on K∗(A) continues to be well defined.\r
Given e, f ∈ K∗(A) one considers e⊗f\r
0 as an element of K∗(A⊗A0\r
) and evaluates\r
he, fi = hIndex D , e ⊗ f\r
0\r
i.\r
From the table of commutation of axiom 7 one gets for instance that this inter\u0002section form is symplectic for n = 2 or 6 and quadratic for n = 0 or 4 modulo 8\r
as in the usual case.\r
We shall modify axiom 2 in the following way,\r
(2′) [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
Note that by (7′) a and b\r
0\r
commute so that the formulation of (2′) is symmetric,\r
i.e. it is equivalent to\r
[[D, b0], a] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
Finally we shall slightly modify (4). Of course Hochschild homology continues to\r
make sense in the non commutative case.\r
(4′) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A ⊗A0) such that γ = π(c) satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ\r
2 = 1, γ a = a γ ∀ a ∈ A, γ D = −D γ. (In the odd case we simply\r
require π(c) = 1.)\r
We view A ⊗ A0 as a bimodule over A by restricting to the subalgebra A ⊗ 1 ⊂\r
A ⊗ A0the natural structure of A ⊗ A0 bimodules on A ⊗ A0. This gives\r
a(b ⊗ c\r
0\r
) d = a b d ⊗ c\r
0 ∀ a, b, c, d ∈ A .\r
Note that the Hochschild homology makes sense with coefficients in any bimodule.\r
Since we have a representation of A ⊗ A0in H, π(c) continues to make sense.\r
The axioms (3) and (5) are unchanged in the non commutative case, and the proof\r
of the measurability of the operators a dsn for any a ∈ A continues to hold in that\r
generality.\r
Thus a non commutative geometry of dimension n is given by a triple (A, H, D)\r
with real structure J satisfying (1) (2′) (3) (4′) (5) (6′) (7′).\r
14

Examples and internal diffeomorphisms.\r
Let us give some simple examples. Let us first assume that A is the finite dimen\u0002sional commutative algebra A = C\r
N . Even though A is commutative it admits\r
non trivial geometries and these are classified, up to homotopy of the operator D,\r
by integral quadratic forms q = (qij )i,j∈1,...,N which are invertible over Z. The\r
geometry associated to a quadratic form q is defined as follows. One lets H =\r
⊕\r
i,j\r
Hij where Hij = C\r
nij , nij = |qij |. The left action of A in H is given, with\r
obvious notations by\r
(a ξ)ij = ai ξij ∀ a ∈ A , ξ ∈ H .\r
The Z/2 grading γ is given by\r
(γ ξ)ij = γij ξij γij = Sign qij\r
and the isometric antilinear involution J is given by,\r
(J ξ)ij = ξji .\r
(It makes sense since qij = qji.)\r
One has K0(A) = Z\r
n and the intersection pairing is given by the quadratic form\r
q.\r
A choice of D is determined by a function m on the edges of the graph Γ defined\r
as follows. The vertices of Γ are the (i, j) with qij 6= 0, the edges of Γ are the (i, j),\r
(k, ℓ) for which γij γkℓ = −1 and i = k or j = ℓ. The function m on Γ(1) has to\r
satisfy mij,kℓ = mkℓ,ij and mij,kℓ = mji,ℓk. One can find D so that the obtained\r
geometry is connected iff the above graph is connected.\r
As a next simple example let A = C∞(M, Mk(C)) be the algebra of k × k\r
matrix valued functions on a smooth compact Spin manifold M. Let g be a\r
Riemannian metric on M and H = L\r
2\r
(M, S ⊗ Mk(C)) be the Hilbert space of L\r
2\r
sections of the tensor product S ⊗Mk(C) of the Spinor bundle S by Mk(C). Then\r
A acts on H by left multiplication,\r
(a ξ)(x) = a(x) ξ(x) ∀ x ∈ M .\r
The real structure J is given by\r
J = C ⊗ ∗\r
15

where C is the charge conjugation on spinors and ∗ is the adjoint operation T → T\r
∗\r
on matrices. This operation transforms the left multiplication operators ξ → a ξ\r
on matrices into right multiplication operators ξ → ξ a∗so that one checks axiom\r
(7′),\r
[a, b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A , b0 = J b∗ J\r
−1\r
.\r
As a first choice of D one can take D = ∂/M ⊗ 1, the tensor product of the Dirac\r
operator ∂/M on M by the identity on Mk(C). One can then easily check that\r
one obtains a non commutative geometry in this way. This example is relevant\r
to illustrate two facts which hold in general in the non commutative case. The\r
first is that the group Aut(A) of ∗ automorphisms of the algebra A, which plays\r
in general the role of the group Diff(M) of diffeomorphisms of the manifold M\r
and acts on the space of representations π by composition, has a natural normal\r
subgroup\r
Int M ⊂ Aut M\r
where Int M is the group of inner automorphisms, i.e. automorphisms of the form,\r
αu(x) = u x u∗ ∀ x ∈ A ,\r
where u is an arbitrary element of the unitary group\r
U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u\r
∗ u = 1} .\r
Moreover the action of this group of internal diffeomorphisms on our geometries\r
can be expressed in a simple manner. Indeed the replacement of the representation\r
π by π ◦ α\r
−1\r
u\r
is equivalent to the replacement of the operator D by\r
De = D + A + J A J−1\r
where A = u[D, u∗].\r
The desired unitary equivalence is given by the operator,\r
U = u J u J−1.\r
(One checks that U D U∗ = De and that U α−1\r
u\r
(x) U\r
∗ = x for any x ∈ A.)\r
The above perturbation of the metric is a special case of internal perturbation\r
given by,\r
De = D + A + J A J−1\r
16

where A = A∗\r
is now an arbitrary operator of the form\r
A = Σ ai[D, bi] ai, bi ∈ A .\r
In the commutative case such perturbations of the metric all vanish because A =\r
A∗implies A + J A J−1 = 0. But in the non commutative case they do not. Thus\r
in our example with k > 1 one gets that,\r
Int M = C\r
∞(M, SU(k))\r
is the group of local gauge transformations (internal symmetries) for an SU(k)\r
gauge theory on M. The internal perturbations of the metric are parametrized by\r
SU(k) gauge potentials, i.e. by the non tracial part of A = Σ ai[D, bi], ai, bi ∈ A.\r
One can compute the effect of such internal perturbations to the distance between\r
two pure states ϕ, ψ on A. We take x, y ∈ M and let ϕ and ψ correspond to two\r
unit vectors (rays) in C\r
k by the equality\r
ϕ(a) = ha(x) ξ, ξi , ψ(a) = ha(y) η, ηi ∀ a ∈ A .\r
The distance d(ϕ, ψ) for the metric De is defined as usual by\r
d(ϕ, ψ) = Sup {|ϕ(a) − ψ(a)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a e ]k ≤ 1} .\r
This distance depends heavily on the gauge connection A. The latter defines an\r
horizontal distribution H on the fibre bundle P over M whose fiber over each\r
x ∈ M is the pure state space Pk−1(C) of Mk(C). The metric d turns out to be\r
equal to the Carnot metric ([G]) on P defined by the horizontal distribution H\r
and the Euclidean structure on H given by the Riemannian metric of M,\r
d(ϕ, ψ) = Inf Z 1\r
0\r
kπ∗( ˙γ(t))k dt , γ(0) = ϕ , γ(1) = ψ\r
where π : P → M is the projection and γ varies through all horizontal paths\r
( ˙γ(t) ∈ H ∀ t) which join ϕ to ψ. In particular the finiteness of d(ϕ, ψ) for x = y\r
is governed by the holonomy of the connection at the point x. The flat situation\r
A = 0 corresponds to the product geometry of M by the finite geometry where the\r
algebra is MN (C) and D = 0. For the latter since D = 0 the distance between any\r
two ϕ 6= ψ is +∞. Thus for the product one gets that the connected components\r
of the metric topology are the flat sections of the bundle P. Alternatively, if the\r
holonomy at x is SU(k), the metric on the fiber Px is finite.\r
17

Our next example will be highly non commutative. It is a special case of a\r
general construction that works for any isometry of a Riemannian Spin manifold,\r
but we shall work it out in the very specific case where this isometry is the irrational\r
rotation Rθ of the circle S\r
1\r
. This will have the advantage of definitness but the\r
whole discussion is general. The algebra is the irrational rotation smooth algebra,\r
Aθ = {Σ anm U\r
n Vm ; a = (an,m) ∈ S(Z2\r
)}\r
where S(Z\r
2\r
), the Schwartz space of Z\r
2\r
, is the space of sequences of rapid decay\r
(i.e. (1 + |n| + |m|)\r
k an,m is bounded for any k ≥ 0). The ∗ algebra structure is\r
governed by the presentation,\r
U\r
∗ = U−1\r
, V ∗ = V\r
−1\r
, V U = λ U V with λ = exp(2πiθ)\r
with θ ∈]0, 1].\r
In order to specify the metric structure of our non commutative geometry we shall\r
need, as for usual elliptic curves, a complex number τ , ℑτ > 0. We can then\r
describe the geometry as follows: the Hilbert space H is given by the sum of\r
2-copies of L\r
2\r
(Aθ, τ0) where τ0 is the canonical normalized trace,\r
τ0(a) = a00 ∀ a ∈ Aθ .\r
The Hilbert space L\r
2\r
(Aθ, τ0) is just the completion of Aθ for the inner product\r
ha, bi = τ0(b\r
∗ a) ∀ a, b ∈ Aθ.\r
The representation of Aθ in H is given by left multiplication, i.e. as 2 copies of\r
the left regular representation,\r
a →\r
\u0014\r
λ(a) 0\r
0 λ(a)\r
\u0015\r
, λ(a) b = a b ∀ a, b ∈ Aθ .\r
The operator D depends explicitly on the choice of τ and is\r
D =\r
\u0014\r
0 δ1 + τ δ2\r
−δ1 − τ δ2 0\r
\u0015\r
where the δj are the following derivations of Aθ,\r
δ1(U) = 2πi U , δ1(V ) = 0 ; δ2(U) = 0 , δ2(V ) = 2πi V .\r
The Z/2 grading γ is just γ =\r
\u0014\r
1 0\r
0 −1\r
\u0015\r
.\r
18

\u0014\r
To specify our geometry it remains to give the antilinear isometry. We let J =\r
0 J0\r
−J0 0\r
\u0015\r
where J0 is Tomita’s involution ([Ta]),\r
J0 a = a\r
∗\r
∀ a ∈ L\r
2\r
(Aθ, τ0).\r
Note that J0 λ(a\r
∗\r
) J\r
−1\r
0 = ρ(a) is the right multiplication by a ∈ Aθ so that our\r
axiom (7′) is easy to check. The dimension n is equal to 2 so that J D = D J,\r
J\r
2 = −1 and J γ = −γ J as expected.\r
The other axioms are easy to check but axiom (4′) is not so trivial because it\r
requires to exhibit a Hochschild 2-cycle, c ∈ Z2(Aθ, Aθ) such that π(c) = γ. It\r
turns out to be,\r
c = (2iπ)\r
−2\r
(τ − τ )\r
−1\r
(V\r
−1 U−1 ⊗ U ⊗ V − U−1 V−1 ⊗ V ⊗ U).\r
(Note that this is not the same as the antisymmetrization of V\r
−1 U−1 ⊗ U ⊗ V\r
because of the phase factor in V\r
−1 U−1 6= U−1 V−1\r
.) One checks that b c = 0 and\r
π(c) = γ.\r
Note also that the area, R− ds2 =\r
R\r
− D−2 of the non commutative torus depends on\r
τ in the same way as c, the reason is that it has homological significance,\r
R\r
− ds2 = hϕ, ci\r
where the cyclic cocycle ϕ is rigidly fixed by its integrality as the chern character\r
of our K-cycle.\r
It is also worthwile to check in some detail the Poincar´e duality. The point is\r
that while at a superficial level our geometry T\r
2\r
θ\r
looks like an ordinary torus, this\r
impression quickly fades away if we realize that for θ /∈ Q the algebra Aθ contains\r
many non trivial idempotents ([Ri] [Po]) and smooth real elements a = a\r
∗ of Aθ\r
can have Cantor spectrum (thus from the point of view of a the space T\r
2\r
θ\r
looks as\r
totally disconnected). In fact at first it might seem that Poincar´e duality might\r
fail since there is no element x ∈ K0(Aθ), x 6= 0 of virtual dimension 0, τ0(x) = 0,\r
the characteristic property of the Bott element. Indeed, when θ /∈ Q, the K0\r
group is Z\r
2\r
([Pi-V]) and the trace τ0(n e0 + me1) = n + mθ never vanishes unless\r
n = m = 0. The above specifies uniquely the basis e0 = [1] and e1, τ0(e1) = θ of\r
K0 and we take the basis U, V for K1. In this basis the intersection form of axiom\r
(6) is given by the symplectic matrix,\r
\r
\r
\r
0 −1 0 0\r
1 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 −1\r
0 0 1 0\r
\r
\r
 .\r
19

It follows that Poincar´e duality is satisfied and that the Bott element β makes\r
sense, as an element of K0(A0\r
θ ⊗ Aθ). It is given by\r
β = e\r
0\r
0 ⊗ e1 − e\r
0\r
1 ⊗ e0 + u\r
0 ⊗ v − v0 ⊗ u\r
where we denote by ⊗ the external cup product in K theory. One can check that\r
with µ the K-homology class on Aθ⊗A0\r
θ\r
given by our K-cycle one has the Poincar´e\r
duality equation ([CS])\r
µ ⊗A0\r
θ\r
β = idAθ β ⊗Aθ µ = idA0\r
θ\r
.\r
Finally the unique trace on A0\r
θ ⊗ Aθ is τ\r
0\r
0 ⊗ τ0 and it does vanish on β, hτ\r
0\r
0 ⊗\r
τ0, βi = 0 which is the expected property of the Bott element.\r
In the general theory both β ∈ K∗(A0\r
θ ⊗ Aθ) and µ ∈ K∗\r
(Aθ ⊗ A0\r
θ\r
) make sense\r
and satisfy the above equation. Moreover the local index theorem of [CM] allows to\r
compute the pairing hµ, βi by a local formula, i.e. a formula invoking R− of simple\r
algebraic expressions. This yields the Gauss Bonnet theorem in our context, due\r
to the equality,\r
hµ, βi = Rank K0 − Rank K1\r
(where the rank is the rank of the abelian group, i.e. dimQ (Kj ⊗ Q)). Using\r
the automorphism σ of Aθ associated to a unimodular integral matrix \u0014\r
a b\r
c d \u0015\r
∈\r
SL(2, Z) by,\r
σ(U) = U\r
a Vb\r
, σ(V ) = U\r
c Vd\r
it is not difficult to check that, up to an irrelevant scale factor, the non commu\u0002tative geometry T\r
2\r
θ,τ only depends upon the value of τ in C\r
+/PSL(2, Z). The\r
new phenomenon which occurs in the non commutative case is the Morita equiva\u0002lence of geometries which will correspond here to the action of the modular group\r
PSL(2, Z) on the module θ rather than τ . To change θ in this way one uses a\r
finite projective right module E over the algebra A and then one replaces A by\r
the algebra B = EndA(E). To be more specific let us change θ in −\r
1\r
θ\r
as follows.\r
We take for E the following right A-module ([Co]). As a vector space E is the\r
Schwartz space S(R) of functions on R. The right action of Aθ on S is specified\r
by the rules,\r
(ξ U)(s) = ξ(s + θ) ∀ ξ ∈ S(R) , ∀ s ∈ R\r
(ξ V )(s) = e\r
2πis ξ(s) ∀ ξ ∈ S(R) , ∀ s ∈ R.\r
20

One checks directly that the algebra B = EndAθ\r
(S) is isomorphic to A−1/θ with\r
generators given by the translation by 1 and the multiplication by the function\r
s → exp \r
2πis\r
θ\r
\u0001\r
. This Aθ- module S is naturally a hermitian module ([Co]) and\r
we can now apply the following general operation of Morita equivalence in non\r
commutative geometry.\r
Let (A, H, D) be a given geometry and B = EndA(E) a Morita equivalent algebra.\r
Then a non commutative geometry, (B, He, De) is uniquely specified by a hermitian\r
connection ([Co]) ∇ on E. Such a connection is a linear map,\r
∇ : E → E ⊗A Ω\r
1\r
D\r
where Ω1\r
D is the A-bimodule,\r
Ω\r
1\r
D = {Σ ai\r
[D, bi] ; ai, bi ∈ A} ⊂ L(H)\r
and ∇ should satisfy the Leibnitz rule and the compatibility with the hermitian\r
structure,\r
1) ∇(ξ a) = (∇ ξ) a + ξ ⊗ [D, a] ∀ a ∈ A , ξ ∈ E\r
2) (ξ, ∇ η) − (∇ ξ, η) = d(ξ, η) ∀ ξ, η ∈ E\r
where d a = [D, a] by definition.\r
To construct He and De one proceeds as follows.\r
One lets He = E ⊗A H ⊗A E where E is the conjugate module, with elements ξ,\r
ξ ∈ E and the module structure,\r
a ξ = (ξ a∗\r
)\r
− ∀ ξ ∈ E , a ∈ A .\r
Then He has a natural Hilbert space structure (cf. [Co]) obtained using the her\u0002mitian structure of E.\r
The operator De is given by the formula,\r
De(ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = (∇ ξ) η ⊗ ζ + ξ ⊗ D η ⊗ ζ + ξ ⊗ η(∇ ζ)\r
where we take advantage of the action of Ω1\r
D in H in order to make sense of (∇ ξ) η\r
for instance (cf. [Co]). The above formula is compatible with tensor products over\r
A. Similarly the real structure Je is given by (with obvious notations),\r
Je(ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = ζ ⊗ J η ⊗ ξ .\r
21

One then checks that all our axioms are fulfilled by the triple (B, He, De) and Je\r
where the action of B is given by\r
b (ξ ⊗ η ⊗ ζ) = (b ξ) ⊗ η ⊗ ζ .\r
In our specific example of the right module S on Aθ the Aθ bimodule Ω1\r
D is easily\r
computed and (cf. [Co]) as a bimodule it is the sum of two copies of Aθ which we\r
write by identifying ω ∈ Ω\r
1\r
D with a 2 × 2 matrix of the form,\r
ω =\r
\u0014\r
0 λ(a)\r
λ(b) 0 \u0015\r
and writing a = (δ1 + τ δ2)(x), b = (−δ1, −τ δ2)(x) for any x ∈ A and ω = dx.\r
A connection ∇ is uniquely specified by the two covariant derivatives ∇j which\r
correspond to δj . Thus a specific choice of connection on S is given by\r
(∇1 ξ)(s) = 2πi\r
θ\r
s ξ(s)\r
(∇2 ξ)(s) = ξ\r
′\r
(s).\r
We leave as an exercise to compute the corresponding value of the module τ\r
′\r
for\r
the Morita equivalent geometry on T\r
2\r
−1/θ. The connection ∇ used in this example\r
has constant curvature (cf. [C-R]) but there is a lot of freedom in the choice of\r
the connection. Indeed the space of connections is naturally an affine space over\r
the vector space HomA(E, E ⊗A Ω\r
1\r
D) (with the selfadjointness condition).\r
All this discussion applies in particular when E = A and yields a whole new class\r
of geometries, the internal perturbation which replace D by D+A+J A J−1 where\r
A is an arbitrary selfadjoint element of Ω1\r
D.\r
These internal perturbations are trivial: A + J A J−1 = 0 when the geometry is\r
commutative (theorem 1). They are highly non trivial for T\r
2\r
θ\r
, θ /∈ Q.\r
When θ /∈ Q the von Neumann algebra weak closure of Aθ in H is the hyperfinite\r
factor of type T1 and the antilinear isometry J0 is Tomita’s involution. In the\r
general theory it is always true that the von Neumann algebra A′′ weak closure of\r
A in H is finite and hyperfinite. This follows from axiom 5, the general properties\r
of the Dixmier trace and the results of [Co]. In particular the von Neumann\r
algebras involved in our geometries are completely classified up to isomorphism\r
([Co]).\r
The non commutative geometry of the standard model.\r
22

We shall now describe a simple finite geometry of dimension equal to 0, (AF , HF ,\r
DF ) (F for finite), whose product by ordinary Euclidean 4-dimensional geometry\r
(or more generally by a 4-dimensional Spin manifold) will give the standard model\r
(SM) in the following way:\r
1) The Hilbert space H will describe the (one particle) Fermionic sector of the\r
SM.\r
2) The inner fluctuations of the metric D → D + A + J A J−1 give exactly the\r
bosonic sector of SM with the correct quantum numbers and hypercharges for\r
the coupling with the fermions: hDψ, ψi.\r
3) The spectral action Trace (ϕ(D−1)) + hDψ, ψi restricted to the inner fluctu\u0002ations of the metric, gives the SM Lagrangian.\r
We postpone the proof of (3) and the analysis of its relation to gravity to our\r
collaboration with A.C. [CC].\r
In this paper we shall describe the geometry (AF , HF , DF ) and check (2) in some\r
detail.\r
We let HF be the Hilbert space with basis the list of elementary Fermions. Thus\r
each generation of Fermions contributes by a space of dimension 15 + 15 where\r
15 = 12 + 3. The 12 corresponds to the quarks and 12 = 4×3 where the 4 is given\r
by the table\r
uR uL\r
dR dL\r
of up and down particles of left or right chirality, while the 3 is given by the color\r
index. The 3 in 15 = 12 + 3 corresponds to the leptons and is given by the table\r
νL\r
eR eL\r
.\r
The second 15 in 15 + 15 corresponds to antiparticles and is obtained by putting\r
an f instead of an f for any f in the above basis. This gives us the antilinear\r
isometry J = JF in HF , by\r
JF (Σ λi fi + Σ µj fj\r
) = Σ µj fj + Σ λi fi\r
for any λi, µj ∈ C.\r
We let AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3(C) be the direct sum the real involutive algebras C of\r
complex numbers, H of quaternions, and M3(C) of 3 × 3 matrices. (Recall that\r
quaternions q can be represented as 2 × 2 matrices of the form h\r
α\r
−β\r
β\r
α\r
i\r
where\r
α, β ∈ C.)\r
23

Let us give the action of A in HF . We let, for a = (λ, q, m) ∈ A,\r
a uR = λ uR a uL = α uL − β dL\r
a dR = λdR a dL = β uL + α dL .\r
(Independently of the color index), while for leptons the formula is the same but\r
there is no uR.\r
This fixes completely the action of A on particles. The action on antiparticles f\r
is given by: (for a = (λ, q, m) as above)\r
a f = λ f if f is a lepton\r
a f = m f if f is a quark .\r
Here the 3 × 3 matrix is acting in the obvious way on the color index.\r
For the operator DF we take DF =\r
\u0014\r
Y 0\r
0 Y\r
\u0015\r
where Y is the Yukawa coupling\r
matrix, which has the dimension of a mass, and is of the form:\r

For one generation Mu, Md and Me would just be scalars but for 3 generations\r
they are matrices which encode both the masses of the Fermions and their mixing\r
properties.\r
Let us now check our axioms for this 0-dimensional geometry (AF , HF , DF ). We\r
begin by checking 7′). One has J\r
2\r
F = 1, JF DF = DF JF and it is clear that JF\r
commutes with the natural Z/2 grading given by chirality:\r
γ(fR) = fR , γ(fL) = −fL (f particle or antiparticle).\r
But the important property is that [a, b0] = 0 for any a, b ∈ A (cf. (7′)), where\r
b\r
0 = J b∗ J−1 ∀ b ∈ A. To check it, it is enough to see what happens on one\r
generation of particles. For quarks the right action b\r
0 of b ∈ A b = (λ, q, m)\r
is given by mt acting on the color index which obviously commutes with the left\r
24

action of A. For leptons the right action is by the scalar λ which also commutes\r
with the left action of A.\r
We have thus checked (7′). Since n = 0 and HF is finite dimensional the axiom\r
(1) is obvious. To check (2′) we need to show that [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.\r
Once again it is enough to check it for one generation of particles, it is clear for\r
leptons and it is true for quarks exactly because the color is unbroken so that both\r
a and D exactly commute with the right action of A.\r
Being in finite dimension the axiom 3 is obvious.\r
To check (4′) one verifies that γ = εJ εJ where ε is the following element of A,\r
ε = (1, −1, 1). Thus one has c = ε ⊗ ε\r
0 ∈ A ⊗ A0\r
.\r
Note that our algebra A is real so that (5) has to be stated for the complex algebra\r
generated by A in HF . It is then clear. Finally when we compute the intersection\r
form on K0(A) = Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Z we find, with N the number of generators, the 3 × 3\r
matrix,\r
Q = 2N\r
\r

so that (6) only holds rationally.\r
We now consider a 4-dimensional smooth compact Riemannian manifold M with a\r
fixed spin structure and consider its product with the above finite geometry. One\r
can prove that our notion of geometry is stable by products. When one of the two\r
geometries is even (i.e. it possesses a Z/2 grading γ1), the product geometry is\r
given by the rules,\r
A = A1 ⊗ A2 , H = H1 ⊗ H2 , D = D1 ⊗ 1 + γ1 ⊗ D2 .\r
To check axiom (4′) for instance one uses the shuffle product in Hochschild homo\u0002logy (cf. Loday).\r
For the product of the manifold M by the finite geometry F we thus have A =\r
C∞(M) ⊗ AF = C∞(M, AF ), H = L\r
2\r
(M, S) ⊗ HF = L\r
2\r
(M, S ⊗ HF ) and D =\r
∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF where ∂/M is the Dirac operator on M.\r
25

Let us check that the inner fluctuations of the metric give us the gauge bosons\r
of the standard model with their correct quantum numbers. We first have to\r
compute A = Σ ai[D, a′\r

i ∈ A. Since D = ∂/M ⊗ 1 + γ5 ⊗ DF decomposes\r
as a sum of two terms, so does A and we first consider the discrete part A(0,1)\r

the right quantum numbers. The antiparticle sector does not contribute to A(0,1)\r
because the left action of AF on this sector exactly commutes with DF .\r

matrix plus a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Since the latter does not\r
affect the metric we shall ignore it. This amounts to remove a U(1) by imposing\r

Together with the above Higgs doublet which gives the scalar part of A + J A J−1\r
we thus obtain exactly the gauge bosons of the standard model coupled with the\r

is determined by 2 Qem = YR for right handed particles and 2 Qem = YL + 2 I3\r

We showed in [C] that one obtains the full Lagrangian of the standard model\r
from the sum R− θ\r
2 ds4 + h(D + A + J A J−1\r
)ψ, ψi where θ is the curvature of the\r
27

connection A. However this requires the definition of the curvature and is still\r
in the spirit of gauge theories. What the present paper shows is that one should\r
consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the diffeomorphism group of the\r
non commutative geometry, and the gauge bosons as the internal fluctuations of the\r
metric. It follows then that the action functional should be of purely gravitational\r
nature. We state the principle of spectral invariance, stronger than the invariance\r
under diffeomorphisms, which requires that the action functional only depends on\r
the spectral properties of D = ds−1in H. This is verified by the action,\r
I = Trace (ϕ(ds/ℓp)) + hD ψ, ψi\r
for any nice function ϕ from R\r
∗\r
+ to R.\r
We shall show in [CC] that this action gives the SM Lagrangian coupled with grav\u0002ity. It would seem at first sight that the algebra A has disappeared from the scene\r
when one writes down the above action, the point is that it is still there because it\r
imposes the constraints [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A and Σ a\r
0\r
i\r
[D, a1\r
i\r
] . . . [D, a4\r
i\r
] = γ\r
coming from axioms 2 and 4.\r
It is important at this point to note that the integrality, n ∈ N of the dimension\r
of a non commutative geometry appears to be essential to define the Hochschild\r
cycle c ∈ Zn and in turns the chirality γ. This is very similar to the obstruction\r
which appears when one tries to apply dimensional regularization to chiral gauge\r
theories.\r
The relations (axioms 2 and 4) which relate the algebra A with the infinitesimal\r
length element ds are very simple but it is clear that more involved relations of a\r
quartic type are necessary to cover the hypoelliptic situation encountered in [CM].\r
Also the algebra A = C∞(M)⊗ AF used in the description of the standard model\r
is only slightly non commutative. This commutativity should fade away when one\r
gets to energies Λ ∼ mp so that the inner automorphisms Int A exhaust more and\r
more automorphisms of A. It is tempting to follow the approximation scheme given\r
in [GKP] but the main difficulty is that the above non linear constraints between\r
the algebra A and the operator D do not have finite dimensional realizations since\r
the Hochschild homology H4(A, A) vanishes for any finite dimensional algebra A.\r
As a final remark we look for an explanation of the remaining non commutativity of\r
the algebra A = C∞(M)⊗AF from the theory of quantum groups at roots of unity.\r
The simple fact is that the Spin covering of SO(4), i.e. Spin(4) is not the maximal\r
covering in the world of quantum groups. Indeed, Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2) and\r
28

even the single group SU(2) admits, in the sense of non commutative geometry\r
(cf. [M]) non trivial extensions of finite order, (Frobenius at ∞)\r
1 → H → SU(2)q → SU(2) → 1\r
where q is any root of unity, q\r
m = 1, of odd order. The simplest instance is when\r
m = 3 so that q = exp \r
2πi\r
3\r
\u0001\r
. The quantum group H has a finite dimensional Hopf\r
algebra which is closely related to the algebra AF . The Spin representation of H\r
defines, like any other representation of H, a bimodule over the Hopf algebra of\r
H. The structure of this bimodule turns out to be very similar to the structure of\r
the bimodule HF over AF that we described above. The details of the adaptation\r
of these ideas to Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2) still remain to be elucidated.\r

Gravity coupled with matter and the\r
foundation of non commutative geometry\r
Alain CONNES\r
I.H.E.S., 91440 Bures-sur-Yvette, France\r
Abstract. We first exhibit in the commutative case the simple al\u0002gebraic relations between the algebra of functions on a manifold and\r
its infinitesimal length element ds. Its unitary representations cor\u0002respond to Riemannian metrics and Spin structure while ds is the\r
Dirac propagator ds=×—×=D\r
−1 where\r
D is the Dirac operator.\r
We extend these simple relations to the non commutative case using\r
Tomita’s involutionJ. We then write a spectral action, the trace of a\r
function of the length element in Planck units, which when applied to\r
the non commutative geometry of the Standard Model will be shown\r
(in a joint work with Ali Chamseddine) to give the SM Lagrangian\r
coupled to gravity. The internal fluctuations of the non commutative\r
geometry are trivial in the commutative case but yield the full bosonic\r
sector of SM with all correct quantum numbers in the slightly non\r
commutative case. The group of local gauge transformations appears\r
spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the diffeomorphism group.\r
Riemann’s concept of a geometric space is based on the notion of a manifold\r
M whose pointsx∈M are locally labelled by a finite number of real coordinates\r
x\r
µ\r
∈R. The metric data is given by the infinitesimal length element,\r
(1) ds\r

=gµν dx\r

which allows to measure distances between two points x, y as the infimum of the 1

length of arcs x(t) from x to y,\r
(2) d(x, y) = Inf Z y\r
x\r
ds .\r
In this paper we shall build our notion of geometry, in a very similar but somehow\r
dual manner, on the pair (A, ds) of the algebra A of coordinates and the infinite\u0002simal length element ds. For the start we only consider ds as a symbol, which\r
together with A generates an algebra (A, ds). The length element ds does not\r
commute with the coordinates, i.e. with the functions f on our space, f ∈ A.\r
But it does satisfy non trivial relations. Thus in the simplest case where A is\r
commutative we shall have,\r
(3) \u0002[f, ds−1], g\u0003= 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A .\r
The only other relation between ds and A is of degree n in ds−1 = D and expresses\r
the homological nature of the volume form (see axiom 4 below). When A is\r
commutative it has a spectrum, namely the space of algebra preserving maps from\r
A to the complex numbers,\r
(4) χ : A → C ; χ(a + b) = χ(a) + χ(b) , χ(ab) = χ(a) χ(b) ∀ a, b ∈ A ,\r
χ(λa) = λ χ(a) ∀ λ ∈ C , ∀ a ∈ A .\r
For instance, when A is the algebra of functions on a space M the space of such\r
maps, called characters of A identifies with M. To each point x ∈ M corresponds\r
the character χx,\r
(5) χx(f) = f(x) ∀ f ∈ A .\r
While relations such as (3) between the algebra A and the length element ds hold at\r
the universal level, a specific geometry will be specified as a unitary representation\r
of the algebra generated by A and ds. In general we shall deal with complex valued\r
functions f so that A will be endowed with an involution,\r
(6) f → f\r
∗\r
which is just complex conjugation of functions in the usual case,\r
(7) f\r
∗\r
(x) = f(x) ∀ x ∈ M ."""

Before we proceed let us first explain what representation of (A, ds) corresponds\r
to an ordinary Riemannian geometry, and check that (10) gives us back exactly\r
the Riemannian geodesic distance of formula (2). The algebra A is the algebra of\r
smooth complex valued functions on M, A = C∞(M) and we choose to represent\r
ds as the propagator for fermions which physicists write in a suggestive ways as\r
×—×. This means that we represent A in the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
(M, S) of square\r
integrable sections of the spinor bundle on M by the following formula,\r
(11) (f ξ)(x) = f(x) ξ(x) ∀ f ∈ A = C\r

length of path, provided (13) is bounded by 1. Thus the equality between (10)\r
and (2).\r
Note that while ds has the dimension of a length, (ds)\r
−1 which is represented by\r
D has the dimension of a mass. The formula (10) is dual to formula (2). In the\r
usual Riemannian case it gives the same answer but being dual it does not use\r
arcs connecting x with y but rather functions from M to C. As we shall see this\r
will allow to treat spaces with a finite number of points on the same footing as the\r
continuum. Another virtue of formula (10) is that it will continue to make sense\r
when the algebra A is no longer commutative.\r
In this paper we shall write down the axioms of geometry as the presentation of\r
the algebraic relations between A and ds and the representation of those relations\r
in Hilbert space.\r
In order to compare different geometries, i.e. different representations of the alge\u0002bra (A, ds) generated by A and ds, we shall use the following action functional,\r
(14) Trace \u0012ϕ\r
\u0012\r
ds\r
ℓp\r
\u0013\u0013\r
where ℓp is the Planck length and ϕ is a suitable cutoff function which will cut off\r
all eigenvalues of ds larger than ℓp.\r
We shall show in [CC] that for a suitable choice of the algebra A, the above\r
action will give Einstein gravity coupled with the Lagrangian of the standard\r
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) model of Glashow Weinberg Salam. The algebra will not\r
be C∞(M) with M a (compact) 4-manifold but a non commutative refinement\r
of it which has to do with the quantum group refinement of the Spin covering of\r
SO(4),\r
(15) 1 → Z/2 → Spin(4) → SO(4) → 1 .\r
Amazingly, in this description the group of gauge transformations of the matter\r
fields arises spontaneously as a normal subgroup of the generalized diffeomorphism\r
group Aut(A).\r
It is the non commutativity of the algebra A which gives for free the group of\r
gauge transformations of matter fields as a (normal) subgroup of the group of dif\u0002feomorphisms. Indeed, when A = C∞(M) is the commutative algebra of smooth\r
4

functions on M one easily checks that the following defines a one to one corre\u0002spondence between diffeomorphisms ϕ of M and the automorphisms α ∈ Aut(A)\r
of the algebra A (preserving the ∗),\r
(16) α(f) (x) = f(ϕ\r
−1\r
(x)) ∀ x ∈ M , f ∈ C\r
∞(M).\r
In the non commutative case an algebra always has automorphisms, the inner\r
automorphisms given by\r
(17) αu(f) = u f u∗ ∀ f ∈ A\r
for any element of the unitary group U of A,\r
(18) U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u\r
∗ u = 1} .\r
The subgroup Int(A) ⊂ Aut(A) of inner automorphisms is a normal subgroup\r
and it will provide us with our group of internal gauge transformations. It is a\r
happy coincidence that the two terminologies : inner automorphisms and internal\r
symmetries actually match. Both groups will have to be lifted to the spinors\r
but we shall see that later. We shall see that the action of inner automorphisms\r
on the metric gives rise to internal fluctuations of the latter which replace D by\r
D + A + J A J−1(see below) and give exactly the gauge bosons of the standard\r
model, with its symmetry breaking Higgs sector, when we apply it to the above\r
finite geometry. We had realized in [Co2] that the fermions were naturally in the\r
adjoint representation of the unitary group U in the case of the standard model,\r
i.e. that the action of U on H was,\r
ξ → u J u J−1ξ = u ξ u∗.\r
But we had not understood the significance of the inner automorphisms as in\u0002ternal diffeomorphisms of the non commutative space. What the present paper\r
shows is that one should consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the\r
diffeomorphism group of the non commutative geometry and the gauge bosons as\r
the internal fluctuations of the metric. We should thus expect that the action\r
functional should be of purely gravitational nature. The above spectral action\r
when restricted to these special metrics will give the interaction Lagrangian of\r
the bosons. The interaction with Fermions, which has the right hypercharge as\u0002signement is obtained directly from hψ, Dψi (with D +A+J A J−1\r
instead of D),\r

and is thus also of spectral nature being invariant under the full unitary group of\r
operators in Hilbert space. Thus the only distinction that remains between matter\r
and gravity is the distinction Int A 6= Aut A which vanishes for a number of highly\r
non commutative algebras.\r
Quantized calculus.\r
In order to ease the presentation of our axioms let us recall the first few lines of the\r
dictionary of the quantized calculus which makes use of the formalism of quantum\r
mechanics to formulate a new theory of infinitesimals. The first two lines of this\r
dictionary are just the traditional way of interpreting the observables in quantum\r
mechanics,\r
Classical Quantum\r
Complex variable Operator in Hilbert space\r
Real variable Selfadjoint operator, T = T\r
∗\r
Infinitesimal variable Compact operator\r
Infinitesimal of order α µn(T) = 0(n\r
−α)\r
Integral R− T = log divergence of the trace of T\r
We recall briefly that an operator T in Hilbert space is compact iff for any ε > 0\r
one has kTk < ε except on a finite dimensional subspace of H. More precisely\r
(19) ∀ ε there exists a finite dimensional subspace E of H\r
such that kT/E⊥k < ε where E\r
⊥ is the orthogonal of E .\r
The size of a compact operator T is measured by the decreasing sequence µn of\r
eigenvalues of |T| =\r
√\r
T ∗ T. The order of such an “infinitesimal” is measured by\r
the rate at which these characteristic values µn(T) converge to 0 when n → ∞.\r
One can show that all the intuitive rules of calculus are valid, e.g. the order of\r
T1+T2 or of T1 T2 are as they should be (≤ α1∨α2 and α1 α2). Moreover the trace\r
(i.e. the sum of the eigenvalues) is logarithmically divergent for infinitesimals of\r
order 1, since µn(T) = 0 \r
1\r
n\r
\u0001\r
. It is a quite remarkable fact that the coefficient\r
of the logarithmic divergency does yield an additive trace which in essence eva\u0002luates the “classical part” of such infinitesimals. This trace, denoted R\r
− vanishes\r
on infinitesimals of order α > 1.\r
The only rule of the naive calculus of infinitesimals which is not fulfilled is com\u0002mutativity but this lack of commutativity is crucial to allow the coexistence of\r
variables with continuous range with infinitesimals which have discrete spectrum."""

Axioms for commutative geometry.\r
Let us now proceed and write down the axioms for commutative geometry. The\r
small modifications required for the non commutative case will only be handled\r
later.\r
Thus H is a Hilbert space, A an involutive algebra represented in H and D = ds−1\r
is a selfadjoint operator in H.\r
We are given an integer n which controls the dimension of our space by the con\u0002dition,\r
1) ds = D−1is an infinitesimal of order 1\r
n\r
.\r
The universal commutation relation (3) is represented by\r
2) [[D, f], g] = 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A.\r
We assume that the simple commutation with |D|, δ(T) = [|D|, T] will only yield\r
bounded operators when we start with any f ∈ A. More precisely we assume that:\r
3) (Smoothness) For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m.\r
This axiom 3 is the algebraic formulation of smoothness of the coordinates.\r
The next axiom is depending upon the parity of n, thus let us state it first when\r
n is even. It yields the γ5 matrix which is abstracted here as a Z/2 grading of the\r
Hilbert space H :\r
4) (Orientability) (n even) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A) such that\r
π(c) = γ satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γD = −Dγ .\r
In the odd case (n odd) one just asks that 1 = π(c) for some n-dimensional\r
Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A).\r
We need to explain briefly what is a Hochschild cycle. Conceptually it is the\r
algebraic formulation of a differential form, so that axiom 4 is really providing us\r
with the volume form. Concretely an n-dimensional Hochschild cycle is a finite\r
sum of elements of A ⊗ A ⊗ . . . ⊗ A (with n + 1 times A),\r
c =\r

such that the contraction bc = 0 where by definition b is linear and satisfies\r
b(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an\r

k+1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an + . . . + (−1)n\r
a\r
n\r
a\r
0 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an−1\r
.\r
When A is commutative it is easy to construct a Hochschild cycle, it suffices to\r
take any a\r
j and consider\r
c =\r
Xε(σ) a\r
0 ⊗ aσ(1) ⊗ aσ(2) ⊗ . . . ⊗ aσ(n)\r
where the sum runs over all the permutations σ of {1, . . ., n}.\r
This special construction corresponds to the familiar differential form a\r
0da1∧da2∧\r
. . . ∧ dan but does not require the previous knowledge of the tangent bundle.\r
Finally π(c) is the representation of c on H induced by\r
π(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ an\r
) = a\r
0\r
[D, a1] . . . [D, an] .\r
To understand the meaning of axiom 4 let us take its simplest instance, with n = 1\r
and A = C∞(S\r
1\r
) generated by a single unitary element U ∈ A, U U∗ = U\r
∗ U = 1.\r
Let c = U\r
−1⊗U one checks that bc = U−1 U −U U −1 = 0 so that c is a Hochschild\r
cycle, c ∈ Z\r
1\r
(A, A). Then the condition π(c) = 1 reads:\r
[D, U] = U .\r
The reader will check at this point that this relation alone completely describes\r
the geometry of the circle, by computing explicitly the distance between points\r
using formula (10). One finds the usual metric on the circle with length 2π.\r
The next axiom will be the axiom of finiteness,\r
5) (Finiteness and absolute continuity.) Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ =\r
∩\r
m\r
Domain Dm is finite and projective. Moreover the following equality defines a\r
hermitian structure ( , ) on this module,\r
ha ξ, ηi = f a(ξ, η) dsn ∀ a ∈ A , ∀ ξ, η ∈ H∞ .\r
We recall from [Co] that a hermitian structure on a finite projective A-module is\r
given by an A-valued inner product. The prototype of such a module with inner\r
product is the following, one lets e ∈ ProjMq(A) be a selfadjoint idempotent,\r
e = e\r
∗\r
, e2 = e\r
8

and one lets E be the left module An e = {(ξj )j=1,...,n ; ξj ∈ A , ξj ejk = ξk} where\r
the action of A is given by left multiplication,\r
(a ξ)j = a ξj ∀ j = 1, . . ., n .\r
The A-valued inner product is then given by:\r
(ξ, η) = Σ ξi η\r
∗\r
i\r
.\r
It follows from axiom 4) and from a general theorem ([Co]) that the operators a dsn,\r
a ∈ A are measurable (cf. [Co]) so that the coefficient R− a dsn of the logarithmic\r
divergence of their trace is unambiguously defined.\r
It follows from axiom 5) that the algebra A is uniquely determined inside its weak\r
closure A′′ (which is also the bicommutant of A in H) by the equality\r
A = {T ∈ A′′ ; T ∈ ∩\r
m>0\r
Dom δ\r
m} .\r
This shows that the whole geometric data (A, H, D) is in fact uniquely determined\r
by the triple (A′′, H, D) where A′′ is a commutative von Neumann algebra.\r
This also shows that A is a pre C\r
∗ algebra, i.e. that it is stable under the C∞\r
functional calculus in the C\r
∗ algebra norm closure of A, A = A. Since we assumed\r
that A was commutative, so is A and by Gelfand’s theorem A = C(X) is the\r
algebra of continuous complex valued functions on X = Spectrum (A). We note\r
finally that characters χ of A extend automatically to A by continuity so that\r
Spectrum A = Spectrum A .\r
We let Ki(A), i = 0, 1 be the K-groups of A (or equivalently of A or of X). Thus\r
K0(A) classifies finite projective modules over A (or equivalently vector bundles\r
over X). Similarly K1(A) is the group of connected components of GL∞(A), i.e.\r
K1(A) = π0 GL∞(A), while by the Bott periodicity theorem one has,\r
πn(GL∞(A)) ∼= Kn+1(A)\r
where n + 1 only matters modulo 2.\r
One easily defines the index pairing of the operator D with Kn(A) where again\r
n only matters modulo 2. In the even case one uses γ to decompose D as D =\r
D+ + D− where D+ = (1 − p) Dp, p =\r

e ∈ A the operator e D+ e is a Fredholm operator from the subspace e p H of H to\r
the subspace e(1 − p)H. This extends immediately to projections e ∈ Mq(A) for\r
some integer q, and gives an additive map from K0(A) to Z denoted hInd D, ei. A\r
similar discussion applies in the odd case ([]).\r
Since A is commutative we have the diagonal map,\r
A ⊗ A m−→ A , m(x ⊗ y) = xy ∀ x, y ∈ A\r
which yields a corresponding map m∗ : K∗(A) × K∗(A) → K∗(A). Composing\r
this map with Ind D we obtain the intersection form,\r
K∗(A) × K∗(A) → Z,\r
(e, f) → hInd D , m∗(e ⊗ f)i.\r
It clearly only depends upon the stable homotopy class of the representation π and\r
thus gives a very rough information on π. We shall assume, (Poincar´e duality)\r
6) The intersection form K∗(A) × K∗(A) → Z is invertible.\r
If one wants to take in account the possible presence of torsion in the K-groups\r
one should formulate Poincar´e duality as the isomorphism,\r
K∗(A)\r
∩µ\r

given by the Kasparov intersection product with the class µ of the Fredholm\r
module (H, D, γ) over A ⊗ A. We refer to [Co] [C] for the detailed formulation,\r
but 6) will suffice for theorem 1 below.\r
Thanks to the work of D. Sullivan [S] one knows that the above Poincar´e duality\r
isomorphism in K theory is (in the simply connected case and ignoring 2-torsion)\r
a characterization of the homotopy type of spaces which possess a structure of\r
smooth manifold. This requires the use of real K theory instead of the above\r
complex K theory and our last axiom will be precisely the existence of such a real\r
structure on our cycle.\r
7) Reality. There exists an antilinear isometry J : H → H such that J a J−1 =\r

We can now state our first result,\r
Theorem. Let A = C∞(M) where M is a smooth compact manifold of dimension\r
n. a) Let π be a unitary representation of (A, ds) satisfying the above seven ax\u0002ioms, then there exists a unique Riemannian metric g on M such that the geodesic\r
distance between any two points x, y ∈ M is given by\r
d(x, y) = Sup {|a(x) − a(y)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a]k ≤ 1} .\r
b) The metric g = g(π) only depends upon the unitary equivalence class of π and\r
the fibers of the map : π → g(π) from unitary equivalence classes to metrics form\r
a finite collection of affine space Aσ parametrized by the Spin structures σ on M.\r
c) The action functional R− dsn−2is a positive quadratic form on each Aσ with a\r
unique minimum πσ.\r
d) πσ is the representation of (A, ds) in L\r
2\r
(M, Sσ) given by multiplication opera\u0002tors and the Dirac operator of the Levi Civita Spin connection.\r

[n/2]\r
.\r
Let us make a few remarks about this theorem.\r
1) Note first that none of the axioms uses the fact that A is the algebra of smooth\r
functions on a manifold. In fact one should deduce from the axioms that the\r
spectrum X of A is a smooth manifold and that the map X → R\r
N , given by\r
the finite collection a\r
i\r
j\r
of elements of A involved in the Hochschild cycle c of\r
axiom 4, is actually a smooth embedding of X as a submanifold of R\r
N . To\r
prove this one should use [Co], proposition 15, p.312.\r
11

2) The two axioms 2 and 3 should be considered as the presentation of the\r
algebra (A, ds). Thus this presentation involves an explicit Hochschild n\u0002cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A) and for n odd gives the relation,\r
Σ a\r
j\r
0\r
[D, aj\r
1\r
] . . . [D, aj\r
n\r
] = 1 .\r
In the even case the relations are D γ = −γ D and γ\r
2 = 1, γ = γ∗\r
, with\r
γ = Σ a\r
j\r
0\r
[D, aj\r
1\r
] . . . [D, aj\r
u\r
] .\r
It is thus natural to fix c as part of the data. The differential form on M =\r
Spectrum A associated to the Hochschild n-cycle c is equal to the volume form\r
of the metric g. Thus fixing c determines the volume form of the metric.\r
3) The sign in front of the Einstein Hilbert action given in (a) is the correct\r
one for the Euclidean formulation of gravity and for instance in the n = 4\r
dimensional case the Einstein Hilbert action becomes the area\r
ℓ\r
−2\r
p\r
R\r
− ds2\r
of our space, in units of Planck length ℓp. Thus the only negative sign in the\r
second derivative of R− ds2 around flat space comes from the Weyl factor which\r
is determined by the choice of c. We refer to [K] and [KW] for the detailed\r
calculation.\r
4) When M is a Spin manifold the map π → g(π) is surjective and if we fix c it\r
surjects to the metrics g with fixed volume form. (This amounts to checking\r
that all axioms are fulfilled.)\r
5) If we drop axiom 7 there is a completely similar result as theorem 1 where\r
Spin is replaced by Spinc(cf. [ML]) and where uniqueness is lost in c) and\r
the minimum of the action f dsn−2is reached on a linear subspace of Aσ with\r
σ a fixed Spincstructure. The elements of this subspace correspond exactly\r
to the U(1) gauge potentials involved in the Spinc Dirac operator and d) e)\r
continue to hold.\r
6) A commutative geometry (A, H, D) is connected iff the only operators com\u0002muting with A and D are the scalars, i.e. iff the representation π of (A, ds)\r
in H is irreducible.\r

longer assume that the algebra A is commutative. Among the axioms we wrote 1)\r
3) 5) will remain unchanged while the others will be slightly modified. One of the\r
most significant results of the theory of operator algebras is Tomita’s theorem [Ta]\r
which asserts that for any weakly closed ∗ algebra of operators M in Hilbert space\r
H which admits a cyclic and separating vector, there exists a canonical antilinear\r
isometric involution J from H to H such that\r
J M J−1 = M′\r
where M′ = {T ; T a = a T ∀ a ∈ M} is the commutant of M. It follows then\r
that M is antiisomorphic to its commutant, the antiisomorphism being given by\r
the C-linear map,\r
a ∈ M → J a∗ J\r
−1 ∈ M′\r
.\r
Now axiom 7 already involves an antilinear isometry J in H, which in the usual\r
geometric case is the charge conjugation. Since we assumed that A was commu\u0002tative the equality J a∗ J\r
−1 = a of axiom 7 is compatible with Tomita’s antiiso\u0002morphism. In general we shall replace the requirement J a∗ J\r
−1 = a ∀ a ∈ A of\r
axiom 7 by the following,\r
7\r
′\r
) One has [a, b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A where b\r
0 = J b∗ J−1\r
(and [a, b0] is the commu\u0002tator ab0 − b\r
0a).\r
Otherwise we leave 7) unchanged. This immediately turns the Hilbert space H\r
into a module over the algebra A ⊗ A0 which is the tensor product of A by its\r
opposite algebra A0. One lets,\r
(a ⊗ b\r
0\r
) ξ = a J b∗ J\r
−1\r
ξ ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
(One can use equivalently the terminology of bimodules or correspondences (cf.\r
[Co]).)\r
Thus axiom (7′) now gives a KR-homology class for the algebra A ⊗ A0endowed\r
with the antilinear automorphism,\r
τ (x ⊗ y\r
0\r
) = y\r
∗ ⊗ x∗0 ∀ x, y ∈ A\r
and we do not need the diagonal map m : A ⊗ A → A (which is an algebra\r
homomorphism only in the commutative case) to formulate Poincar´e duality,\r
13

(6′\r
) The cup product by µ ∈ KRn(A ⊗ A0) is an isomorphism\r
K∗(A)\r
∩µ\r
−→ K∗(A).\r
We also note that the intersection form on K∗(A) continues to be well defined.\r
Given e, f ∈ K∗(A) one considers e⊗f\r
0 as an element of K∗(A⊗A0\r
) and evaluates\r
he, fi = hIndex D , e ⊗ f\r
0\r
i.\r
From the table of commutation of axiom 7 one gets for instance that this inter\u0002section form is symplectic for n = 2 or 6 and quadratic for n = 0 or 4 modulo 8\r
as in the usual case.\r
We shall modify axiom 2 in the following way,\r
(2′) [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
Note that by (7′) a and b\r
0\r
commute so that the formulation of (2′) is symmetric,\r
i.e. it is equivalent to\r
[[D, b0], a] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A .\r
Finally we shall slightly modify (4). Of course Hochschild homology continues to\r
make sense in the non commutative case.\r
(4′) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zn(A, A ⊗A0) such that γ = π(c) satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ\r
2 = 1, γ a = a γ ∀ a ∈ A, γ D = −D γ. (In the odd case we simply\r
require π(c) = 1.)\r
We view A ⊗ A0 as a bimodule over A by restricting to the subalgebra A ⊗ 1 ⊂\r
A ⊗ A0the natural structure of A ⊗ A0 bimodules on A ⊗ A0. This gives\r
a(b ⊗ c\r
0\r
) d = a b d ⊗ c\r
0 ∀ a, b, c, d ∈ A .\r
Note that the Hochschild homology makes sense with coefficients in any bimodule.\r
Since we have a representation of A ⊗ A0in H, π(c) continues to make sense.\r
The axioms (3) and (5) are unchanged in the non commutative case, and the proof\r
of the measurability of the operators a dsn for any a ∈ A continues to hold in that\r
generality.\r
Thus a non commutative geometry of dimension n is given by a triple (A, H, D)\r
with real structure J satisfying (1) (2′) (3) (4′) (5) (6′) (7′)."""

Let us give some simple examples. Let us first assume that A is the finite dimen\u0002sional commutative algebra A = C\r
N . Even though A is commutative it admits\r
non trivial geometries and these are classified, up to homotopy of the operator D,\r
by integral quadratic forms q = (qij )i,j∈1,...,N which are invertible over Z. The\r
geometry associated to a quadratic form q is defined as follows. One lets H =\r
⊕\r
i,j\r
Hij where Hij = C\r
nij , nij = |qij |. The left action of A in H is given, with\r
obvious notations by\r
(a ξ)ij = ai ξij ∀ a ∈ A , ξ ∈ H .\r
The Z/2 grading γ is given by\r
(γ ξ)ij = γij ξij γij = Sign qij\r
and the isometric antilinear involution J is given by,\r
(J ξ)ij = ξji .\r
(It makes sense since qij = qji.)\r
One has K0(A) = Z\r
n and the intersection pairing is given by the quadratic form\r
q.\r
A choice of D is determined by a function m on the edges of the graph Γ defined\r
as follows. The vertices of Γ are the (i, j) with qij 6= 0, the edges of Γ are the (i, j),\r
(k, ℓ) for which γij γkℓ = −1 and i = k or j = ℓ. The function m on Γ(1) has to\r
satisfy mij,kℓ = mkℓ,ij and mij,kℓ = mji,ℓk. One can find D so that the obtained\r
geometry is connected iff the above graph is connected.\r
As a next simple example let A = C∞(M, Mk(C)) be the algebra of k × k\r
matrix valued functions on a smooth compact Spin manifold M. Let g be a\r
Riemannian metric on M and H = L\r
2\r
(M, S ⊗ Mk(C)) be the Hilbert space of L\r
2\r
sections of the tensor product S ⊗Mk(C) of the Spinor bundle S by Mk(C). Then\r
A acts on H by left multiplication,\r
(a ξ)(x) = a(x) ξ(x) ∀ x ∈ M .\r
The real structure J is given by\r
J = C ⊗ ∗\r
15

where C is the charge conjugation on spinors and ∗ is the adjoint operation T → T\r
∗\r
on matrices. This operation transforms the left multiplication operators ξ → a ξ\r
on matrices into right multiplication operators ξ → ξ a∗so that one checks axiom\r
(7′),\r
[a, b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A , b0 = J b∗ J\r
−1\r
.\r
As a first choice of D one can take D = ∂/M ⊗ 1, the tensor product of the Dirac\r
operator ∂/M on M by the identity on Mk(C). One can then easily check that\r
one obtains a non commutative geometry in this way. This example is relevant\r
to illustrate two facts which hold in general in the non commutative case. The\r
first is that the group Aut(A) of ∗ automorphisms of the algebra A, which plays\r
in general the role of the group Diff(M) of diffeomorphisms of the manifold M\r
and acts on the space of representations π by composition, has a natural normal\r
subgroup\r
Int M ⊂ Aut M\r
where Int M is the group of inner automorphisms, i.e. automorphisms of the form,\r
αu(x) = u x u∗ ∀ x ∈ A ,\r
where u is an arbitrary element of the unitary group\r
U = {u ∈ A ; u u∗ = u\r
∗ u = 1} .\r
Moreover the action of this group of internal diffeomorphisms on our geometries\r
can be expressed in a simple manner. Indeed the replacement of the representation\r
π by π ◦ α\r
−1\r
u\r
is equivalent to the replacement of the operator D by\r
De = D + A + J A J−1\r
where A = u[D, u∗].\r
The desired unitary equivalence is given by the operator,\r
U = u J u J−1.\r
(One checks that U D U∗ = De and that U α−1\r
u\r
(x) U\r
∗ = x for any x ∈ A.)\r
The above perturbation of the metric is a special case of internal perturbation\r
given by,\r
De = D + A + J A J−1\r
16

where A = A∗\r
is now an arbitrary operator of the form\r
A = Σ ai[D, bi] ai, bi ∈ A .\r
In the commutative case such perturbations of the metric all vanish because A =\r
A∗implies A + J A J−1 = 0. But in the non commutative case they do not. Thus\r
in our example with k > 1 one gets that,\r
Int M = C\r
∞(M, SU(k))\r
is the group of local gauge transformations (internal symmetries) for an SU(k)\r
gauge theory on M. The internal perturbations of the metric are parametrized by\r
SU(k) gauge potentials, i.e. by the non tracial part of A = Σ ai[D, bi], ai, bi ∈ A.\r
One can compute the effect of such internal perturbations to the distance between\r
two pure states ϕ, ψ on A. We take x, y ∈ M and let ϕ and ψ correspond to two\r
unit vectors (rays) in C\r
k by the equality\r
ϕ(a) = ha(x) ξ, ξi , ψ(a) = ha(y) η, ηi ∀ a ∈ A .\r
The distance d(ϕ, ψ) for the metric De is defined as usual by\r
d(ϕ, ψ) = Sup {|ϕ(a) − ψ(a)| ; a ∈ A , k[D, a e ]k ≤ 1} .\r
This distance depends heavily on the gauge connection A. The latter defines an\r
horizontal distribution H on the fibre bundle P over M whose fiber over each\r
x ∈ M is the pure state space Pk−1(C) of Mk(C). The metric d turns out to be\r
equal to the Carnot metric ([G]) on P defined by the horizontal distribution H\r
and the Euclidean structure on H given by the Riemannian metric of M,\r

We shall now describe a simple finite geometry of dimension equal to 0, (AF , HF ,\r
DF ) (F for finite), whose product by ordinary Euclidean 4-dimensional geometry\r
(or more generally by a 4-dimensional Spin manifold) will give the standard model\r
(SM) in the following way:\r
1) The Hilbert space H will describe the (one particle) Fermionic sector of the\r
SM.\r
2) The inner fluctuations of the metric D → D + A + J A J−1 give exactly the\r
bosonic sector of SM with the correct quantum numbers and hypercharges for\r
the coupling with the fermions: hDψ, ψi.\r
3) The spectral action Trace (ϕ(D−1)) + hDψ, ψi restricted to the inner fluctu\u0002ations of the metric, gives the SM Lagrangian.\r
We postpone the proof of (3) and the analysis of its relation to gravity to our\r
collaboration with A.C. [CC].\r
In this paper we shall describe the geometry (AF , HF , DF ) and check (2) in some\r
detail.\r
We let HF be the Hilbert space with basis the list of elementary Fermions. Thus\r
each generation of Fermions contributes by a space of dimension 15 + 15 where\r
15 = 12 + 3. The 12 corresponds to the quarks and 12 = 4×3 where the 4 is given\r
by the table\r
uR uL\r
dR dL\r
of up and down particles of left or right chirality, while the 3 is given by the color\r
index. The 3 in 15 = 12 + 3 corresponds to the leptons and is given by the table\r
νL\r
eR eL\r
.\r
The second 15 in 15 + 15 corresponds to antiparticles and is obtained by putting\r
an f instead of an f for any f in the above basis. This gives us the antilinear\r
isometry J = JF in HF , by\r
JF (Σ λi fi + Σ µj fj\r
) = Σ µj fj + Σ λi fi\r
for any λi, µj ∈ C.\r
We let AF = C ⊕ H ⊕ M3(C) be the direct sum the real involutive algebras C of\r
complex numbers, H of quaternions, and M3(C) of 3 × 3 matrices. (Recall that\r
quaternions q can be represented as 2 × 2 matrices of the form h\r

But the important property is that [a, b0] = 0 for any a, b ∈ A (cf. (7′)), where\r
b\r
0 = J b∗ J−1 ∀ b ∈ A. To check it, it is enough to see what happens on one\r
generation of particles. For quarks the right action b\r
0 of b ∈ A b = (λ, q, m)\r
is given by mt acting on the color index which obviously commutes with the left\r
24

action of A. For leptons the right action is by the scalar λ which also commutes\r
with the left action of A.\r
We have thus checked (7′). Since n = 0 and HF is finite dimensional the axiom\r
(1) is obvious. To check (2′) we need to show that [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.\r
Once again it is enough to check it for one generation of particles, it is clear for\r
leptons and it is true for quarks exactly because the color is unbroken so that both\r
a and D exactly commute with the right action of A.\r
Being in finite dimension the axiom 3 is obvious.\r
To check (4′) one verifies that γ = εJ εJ where ε is the following element of A,\r
ε = (1, −1, 1). Thus one has c = ε ⊗ ε\r
0 ∈ A ⊗ A0\r
.\r
Note that our algebra A is real so that (5) has to be stated for the complex algebra\r
generated by A in HF . It is then clear. Finally when we compute the intersection\r

We now consider a 4-dimensional smooth compact Riemannian manifold M with a\r

where the matrix for quarks is a 4×4 matrix of 3×3 matrices because V is a 3×3\r
matrix, (ignoring the flavor index). Since we are only interested in the fluctuation\r
of the metric we shall write the total 15 × 15 matrix as the sum of a traceless\r
matrix plus a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Since the latter does not\r
affect the metric we shall ignore it. This amounts to remove a U(1) by imposing\r
the condition that the full matrix is traceless, i.e. that 4 trace V − 4Λ = 0, i.e.\r
trace V = Λ. Thus we get V = V\r

Together with the above Higgs doublet which gives the scalar part of A + J A J−1\r
we thus obtain exactly the gauge bosons of the standard model coupled with the\r
correct hypercharges YL, YR. They are such that the electromagnetic charge Qem,\r
is determined by 2 Qem = YR for right handed particles and 2 Qem = YL + 2 I3\r
where I3 is the 3rd generator of the weak isospin group SU(2). For Qem one gets\r
the same answer for the left and right components of each particle and 2\r
3\r
, −\r
1\r
3\r
for\r
u, d respectively and 0, −1 for ν and e respectively.\r
We showed in [C] that one obtains the full Lagrangian of the standard model\r
from the sum R− θ\r
2 ds4 + h(D + A + J A J−1\r
)ψ, ψi where θ is the curvature of the\r
27

connection A. However this requires the definition of the curvature and is still\r
in the spirit of gauge theories. What the present paper shows is that one should\r
consider the internal gauge symmetries as part of the diffeomorphism group of the\r
non commutative geometry, and the gauge bosons as the internal fluctuations of the\r
metric. It follows then that the action functional should be of purely gravitational\r
nature. We state the principle of spectral invariance, stronger than the invariance\r
under diffeomorphisms, which requires that the action functional only depends on\r
the spectral properties of D = ds−1in H. This is verified by the action,\r
I = Trace (ϕ(ds/ℓp)) + hD ψ, ψi\r
for any nice function ϕ from R\r
∗\r
+ to R.\r
We shall show in [CC] that this action gives the SM Lagrangian coupled with grav\u0002ity. It would seem at first sight that the algebra A has disappeared from the scene\r
when one writes down the above action, the point is that it is still there because it\r
imposes the constraints [[D, a], b0] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A and Σ a\r
0\r
i\r
[D, a1\r
i\r
] . . . [D, a4\r
i\r
] = γ\r
coming from axioms 2 and 4.\r
It is important at this point to note that the integrality, n ∈ N of the dimension\r
of a non commutative geometry appears to be essential to define the Hochschild\r
cycle c ∈ Zn and in turns the chirality γ. This is very similar to the obstruction\r
which appears when one tries to apply dimensional regularization to chiral gauge\r
theories.\r
The relations (axioms 2 and 4) which relate the algebra A with the infinitesimal\r
length element ds are very simple but it is clear that more involved relations of a\r
quartic type are necessary to cover the hypoelliptic situation encountered in [CM].\r
Also the algebra A = C∞(M)⊗ AF used in the description of the standard model\r
is only slightly non commutative. This commutativity should fade away when one\r
gets to energies Λ ∼ mp so that the inner automorphisms Int A exhaust more and\r
more automorphisms of A. It is tempting to follow the approximation scheme given\r
in [GKP] but the main difficulty is that the above non linear constraints between\r
the algebra A and the operator D do not have finite dimensional realizations since\r
the Hochschild homology H4(A, A) vanishes for any finite dimensional algebra A.\r
As a final remark we look for an explanation of the remaining non commutativity of\r
the algebra A = C∞(M)⊗AF from the theory of quantum groups at roots of unity.\r
The simple fact is that the Spin covering of SO(4), i.e. Spin(4) is not the maximal\r
covering in the world of quantum groups. Indeed, Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2) and\r
28

even the single group SU(2) admits, in the sense of non commutative geometry\r
(cf. [M]) non trivial extensions of finite order, (Frobenius at ∞)\r
1 → H → SU(2)q → SU(2) → 1\r
where q is any root of unity, q\r
m = 1, of odd order. The simplest instance is when\r
m = 3 so that q = exp \r
2πi\r
3\r
\u0001\r
. The quantum group H has a finite dimensional Hopf\r
algebra which is closely related to the algebra AF . The Spin representation of H\r
defines, like any other representation of H, a bimodule over the Hopf algebra of\r
H. The structure of this bimodule turns out to be very similar to the structure of\r
the bimodule HF over AF that we described above. The details of the adaptation\r
of these ideas to Spin(4) = SU(2) × SU(2) still remain to be elucidated."""
