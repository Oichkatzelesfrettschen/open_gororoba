Abstract\r
We study zero divisors in the 16–dimensional sedenion algebra from an explicit deter\u0002minantal and geometric viewpoint. For the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣 we prove\r
that\r
det 𝐿𝑣 = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
,\r
where 𝐷1 and 𝐷2 are quartic polynomials in the octonion components 𝑣1, 𝑣2 of 𝑣, and\r
nonzero zero divisors are characterized by 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0. Here 𝐷1 coincides with the\r
squared norm of 𝑣, while 𝐷2 recovers the classical geometric condition ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥,\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 known in work of Moreno and others, but now as an explicit determinant\r
factor.\r
On a carefully chosen 3–dimensional linear slice we derive a local model 𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) =\r
4(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
, so that the zero–divisor set is described there by the quadratic\r
cone 𝑋𝑌 +𝑌 𝑍 +𝑍 𝑋 = 0, and we confirm this by 2D/3D numerical visualization. After\r
normalization, the nontrivial zero divisors form the Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
); on this\r
space we introduce a simple discrete approximation to the Levi–Civita connection and\r
compute its holonomy along a great circle. Projected to a torus of base/fiber angles, the\r
resulting holonomy appears as a concrete (1, 1)–type twisting curve. This illustrates\r
how explicit polynomials and computer graphics can reveal geometric structure in a\r
highly nonassociative algebra.\r
1 Introduction\r
Via the Cayley–Dickson construction, starting from the field of real numbers R, one obtains the complex\r
numbers, quaternions, octonions, and then the 16–dimensional nondivision algebra known as the sedenions.\r
The sedenions lose both associativity and divisibility, but are interesting in that they possess many zero\r
divisors. However, the geometric structure of the zero–divisor set is high–dimensional, and it is difficult to\r
grasp its behavior intuitively.\r
Existing works have shown that the zero–divisor sets of the octonions and the sedenions are related to\r
Stiefel manifolds and the exceptional Lie group 𝐺2, but the framework there is primarily topological or\r
Riemannian–geometric, and there has been comparatively little understanding via explicit polynomials and\r
visualization (see, for example, Moreno [3]). The zero–divisor condition\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
used in this paper is itself already known in the literature on zero divisors in Cayley–Dickson algebras,\r
such as Moreno [3]. The novelty of the present study lies in recasting this condition as a concrete quartic\r

polynomial 𝐷2 arising as a factor of the determinant\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
of the 16×16 real matrix corresponding to left multiplication, and presenting it in a form that can be directly\r
utilized for local models, numerical visualization, and holonomy analysis.\r
In this paper, we focus on the left multiplication matrix of the sedenions and factorize its determinant\r
Δ(𝑣) = det 𝑀(𝑣) explicitly in order to extract two essential factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2 for zero–divisor detection. In\r
particular, 𝐷2 is the factor that characterizes nonzero zero divisors, and its zero set reflects the geometric\r
structure of the zero–divisor set. Beyond making the classical condition |𝑣1| = |𝑣2|, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 appear\r
as a determinant factor, we analyze 𝐷2 on a specific 3–dimensional linear slice and show that the local\r
singular structure is given by the quadratic cone 𝑋𝑌 +𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0, and we define a discrete version of the\r
Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold to visualize its holonomy as curves on a\r
torus.\r
Related work\r
The algebraic and geometric pathology of the sedenions has been discussed from several perspectives.\r
Conway–Smith [2] and Baez [1] emphasized the loss of alternativity and the proliferation of zero divisors\r
once one leaves the octonions, and Moreno [3] gave an explicit description of zero divisors in terms of pairs\r
of orthogonal octonions of equal norm.\r
Eakin–Sathaye [4], Albuquerque–Majid [7], and Okubo [5, 6] study the algebraic properties of Cayley–\r
Dickson algebras that underpin our block matrix decompositions. Standard treatments of Cayley–Dickson\r
algebras and their homogeneous spaces appear in Schafer [9]. In particular, the conditions ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 for the octonionic components (𝑣1, 𝑣2) are classical.\r
To our knowledge, however, these conditions have not been systematically reinterpreted in terms of the\r
determinant of the left multiplication operator, nor has the quartic factor 𝐷2 been written out explicitly in\r
𝐺2–invariant coordinates. Likewise, while the singular nature of the zero–divisor variety is well known, we\r
are not aware of previous work that isolates a concrete three–dimensional slice with a simple double-cone\r
model or that connects the zero–divisor geometry to numerical experiments on Levi–Civita holonomy over\r
the associated Stiefel manifold.\r
Main contributions\r
The geometric and algebraic structure of zero divisors in the sedenions has been investigated from various\r
viewpoints, but several aspects remain only implicitly understood. In this note we isolate and clarify three\r
features that we regard as conceptually useful.\r
(C1) We reinterpret the classical zero–divisor conditions ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 (which go back\r
at least to Moreno and are implicit in the work of Conway–Smith and Baez) as the vanishing of a\r
distinguished quartic factor 𝐷2 in the determinant of the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣. In particular,\r
we give an explicit factorization\r
det 𝐿𝑣 = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4 𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
in terms of the standard 𝐺2–invariant scalar triple (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) on the imaginary octonion components\r
and identify 𝐷2 = 0 as the decisive algebraic condition for the zero–divisor locus.\r
(C2) We restrict 𝐷2 to a simple 3–dimensional linear slice of the zero–divisor variety and obtain the\r
concrete equation\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
.\r
This shows that, at least along this slice, the zero–divisor set is modeled by the double cone 𝑋𝑌 +\r
𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0. We propose this as a canonical local prototype for singularities of the zero–divisor\r
variety and illustrate its geometry via explicit computer graphics.\r
(C3) On the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal zero–divisor pairs (which we informally regard as the zero–\r
divisor frame bundle), we numerically study the Levi–Civita parallel transport along natural torus–type\r
loops. Using a simple Euler-type integrator, we observe that the resulting holonomy generically has\r
(1, 1)–type: it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the span of the two zero divisors and is close to the\r
2

identity on the orthogonal complement. This provides an initial link between the singular algebraic\r
geometry of zero divisors and the Riemannian holonomy of the associated frame space.\r
The structure of the paper is as follows. In §2 we present the minimal preliminaries on the Cayley–\r
Dickson construction and the definition of the left multiplication operator. In §3 we derive the factorization\r
of the determinant of the left multiplication matrix and present Δ = 𝐷\r
4\r
1𝐷\r
2\r
2\r
as a main theorem. In §4\r
we discuss the identification of the normalized zero–divisor manifold with the Stiefel manifold. In §5 we\r
analyze and visualize the local model of 𝐷2 on a cyclic permutation slice. In §6 we describe the visualization\r
of the holonomy. Finally, in §7 and §8 we give discussion and conclusions.\r
2 Preliminaries\r
2.1 Cayley–Dickson construction and the sedenions\r
The Cayley–Dickson construction gives a procedure to obtain the complex numbers, quaternions, octonions,\r
and higher nonassociative algebras by successively doubling the dimension starting from the real numbers\r
R. In this paper, we take the octonion algebra O as known and construct the sedenion algebra 𝑆 from it.\r
As a vector space, 𝑆 is isomorphic to O ⊕ O, and any element 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆 can be uniquely written as\r
𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8, 𝑣1, 𝑣2 ∈ O.\r
Here 𝑒8 is a new imaginary basis element that anticommutes with elements of O. Thus, as a vector space,\r
𝑆 \u001B O ⊕ O \u001B R\r
8 × R8 \u001B R16\r
.\r
The multiplication rule follows the general Cayley–Dickson formula; in this paper we use only the minimal\r
information needed to construct the left multiplication matrix.\r
2.2 Left multiplication operators and the determinant\r
For 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆 we define the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣 : 𝑆 → 𝑆 by\r
𝐿𝑣 (𝑤) = 𝑣𝑤 (𝑤 ∈ 𝑆).\r
Once a basis {𝑒0, . . . , 𝑒15} is fixed, 𝐿𝑣 is represented by a 16 × 16 real matrix 𝑀(𝑣) on R\r
16\r
.\r
Definition 2.1 (Determinant of the left multiplication matrix). We define\r
Δ(𝑣) := det 𝑀(𝑣).\r
The condition Δ(𝑣) = 0 means that 𝐿𝑣 is degenerate, and hence there exists 𝑤 ≠ 0 such that 𝑣𝑤 = 0.\r
Therefore, Δ(𝑣) = 0 is equivalent to 𝑣 being a zero divisor. A concrete factorization of this Δ is one of the\r
main results of the present work.\r
3 Determinant Factorization\r
In this section, we show that the determinant of the left multiplication matrix,\r
Δ(𝑣) := det 𝑀(𝑣),\r
can be factorized as\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
in terms of two fundamental invariants 𝐷1, 𝐷2. Here 𝐷1, 𝐷2 are homogeneous polynomials determined by\r
the norms and inner products of 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8, and we also explain their geometric meaning.\r
3

3.1 Definition of the fundamental factors D1 and D2\r
Definition 3.1 (Fundamental factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2). For a sedenion 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 (𝑣1, 𝑣2 ∈ O), define\r
𝐷1 (𝑣) := ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
,\r
𝐷2 (𝑣) :=\r
\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
\u00012\r
+ 4 ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩\r
2\r
,\r
where ∥ · ∥ is the Euclidean norm on R\r
8 and ⟨·, ·⟩ denotes the standard inner product.\r
First, 𝐷1 agrees with the squared norm of 𝑣 itself.\r
Lemma 3.2. For 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 we have\r
∥𝑣∥\r
2 = 𝐷1 (𝑣) = ∥𝑣1 ∥2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
.\r
Proof. In the Cayley–Dickson construction, the inner product is defined by\r
⟨𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8, 𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8⟩ = ⟨𝑣1, 𝑤1⟩ + ⟨𝑣2, 𝑤2⟩.\r
In particular, setting 𝑤 = 𝑣 gives\r
∥𝑣∥\r
2 = ⟨𝑣, 𝑣⟩ = ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣1⟩ + ⟨𝑣2, 𝑣2⟩ = ∥𝑣1 ∥2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
.\r
□\r
On the other hand, 𝐷2 is the polynomial that vanishes exactly when the two norms are equal and the\r
vectors are orthogonal.\r
Lemma 3.3. For 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 ≠ 0, we have\r
𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0 ⇐⇒ ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0.\r
Proof. From the definition,\r
𝐷2 (𝑣) =\r
\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥\r
2\r
\u00012\r
+ 4 ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩\r
2\r
.\r
The right–hand side is a sum of two nonnegative real numbers, so 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0 if and only if\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2 = 0, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
hold simultaneously. The first condition is equivalent to ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, and the second is the orthogonality\r
condition. Conversely, if these two conditions hold, then clearly 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0. □\r
Thus, 𝐷1 is the norm of 𝑣, while 𝐷2 captures the geometric condition that the lengths of 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 are\r
equal and they are orthogonal.\r
3.2 Block representation of the left multiplication matrix\r
For 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆, the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣 : 𝑆 → 𝑆 is defined by\r
𝐿𝑣 (𝑤) = 𝑣𝑤 (𝑤 ∈ 𝑆).\r
If we fix a basis of the 16–dimensional real vector space 𝑆 \u001B R\r
16, then 𝐿𝑣 is represented by a 16 × 16 real\r
matrix 𝑀(𝑣).\r
Lemma 3.4 (Block matrix representation). For 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 ∈ 𝑆, with a suitable choice of basis, the left\r
multiplication matrix 𝑀(𝑣) can be written as\r
𝑀(𝑣) =\r
\u0012\r
𝐿𝑣1 −𝑅𝑣2\r
𝐿𝑣2 𝑅𝑣1\r
\u0013\r
,\r
where 𝐿𝑣1\r
, 𝐿𝑣2\r
, 𝑅𝑣1\r
, 𝑅𝑣2\r
are the left and right multiplication matrices on the octonions O.\r
4

Proof. Using the Cayley–Dickson multiplication formula\r
(𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8) (𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8) = (𝑣1𝑤1 − 𝑤2𝑣2) + (𝑣2𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑣1)𝑒8,\r
where · denotes octonion conjugation, we obtain\r
𝑤1 ↦−→ 𝑣1𝑤1 − 𝑤2𝑣2, 𝑤2 ↦−→ 𝑣2𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑣1\r
for 𝑤 = 𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8. Writing these as linear maps on O, we have\r
(𝑤1, 𝑤2) ↦−→ 𝐿𝑣1𝑤1 − 𝑅𝑣2𝑤2, 𝐿𝑣2𝑤1 + 𝑅𝑣1𝑤2\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Taking matrix representations with respect to a fixed basis yields the claimed block matrix. □\r
Since the octonions form a normed division algebra, the determinants of the left and right multiplication\r
matrices are determined solely by the norm.\r
Lemma 3.5 (Determinants of left and right multiplication on the octonions). For any 𝑥 ∈ O we have\r
det 𝐿𝑥 = ∥𝑥∥\r
8\r
, det 𝑅𝑥 = ∥𝑥∥\r
8\r
.\r
Proof. The octonions form a normed division algebra, and hence for any 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ O,\r
∥𝑥𝑦∥ = ∥𝑥∥ ∥𝑦∥\r
holds. The operator 𝐿𝑥 corresponds to the linear map 𝑦 ↦→ 𝑥𝑦, and so for all 𝑦 we have\r
∥𝐿𝑥 (𝑦) ∥ = ∥𝑥𝑦∥ = ∥𝑥∥ ∥𝑦∥.\r
Thus 𝐿𝑥 is an isometry that scales the norm by ∥𝑥∥, and hence the absolute value of its determinant is ∥𝑥∥\r
8\r
.\r
Since det 𝐿1 = 1 for 𝑥 = 1 and the determinant depends continuously on 𝑥, we have det 𝐿𝑥 > 0 for all 𝑥.\r
The same argument applies to 𝑅𝑥. □\r
3.3 Main theorem on determinant factorization\r
With these preparations in hand, we now state the main result of this section.\r
Theorem 3.6 (Determinant factorization for sedenion left multiplication). For any 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆, the determinant\r
Δ(𝑣) := det 𝑀(𝑣)\r
of the left multiplication matrix can be factorized as\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4 𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
.\r
In particular, 𝑣 ≠ 0 is a zero divisor if and only if 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0.\r
Proof. Write 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 and set\r
𝑎 := ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, 𝑏 := ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, 𝑐 := ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩.\r
These correspond to 𝐷1, 𝐷2 in Definition 3.1 via\r
𝐷1 (𝑣) = 𝑎, 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 𝑏\r
2 + 4𝑐2\r
.\r
(1) Reduction to invariants. The automorphism group 𝐺2 of the octonions preserves the norm and inner\r
product and also preserves the Cayley–Dickson multiplication and left multiplication matrices (see, for\r
example, Baez [1], Bryant [8], and Moreno [3]). Extending the action to 𝑆 \u001B O ⊕ O by\r
𝑔(𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8) := 𝑔𝑣1 + 𝑔𝑣2𝑒8\r
5

for 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺2, we obtain an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆. Moreover, using the fact that 𝑔 is an automorphism\r
of O and commutes with conjugation, we have\r
𝑔\r
\r
(𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8) (𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝑔(𝑣1𝑤1 − 𝑤2𝑣2) + 𝑔(𝑣2𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑣1)𝑒8\r
= (𝑔𝑣1) (𝑔𝑤1) − 𝑔𝑤2 (𝑔𝑣2) + (𝑔𝑣2) 𝑔𝑤1 + (𝑔𝑤2) (𝑔𝑣1)\r
\u0001\r
𝑒8\r
= (𝑔𝑣1 + 𝑔𝑣2𝑒8) (𝑔𝑤1 + 𝑔𝑤2𝑒8).\r
Thus 𝑔 is an algebra automorphism on 𝑆, and there exists an orthogonal matrix 𝑇𝑔 such that\r
𝑀(𝑔𝑣) = 𝑇𝑔𝑀(𝑣)𝑇\r
−1\r
𝑔\r
,\r
and hence\r
Δ(𝑔𝑣) = det(𝑇𝑔𝑀(𝑣)𝑇\r
−1\r
𝑔\r
) = Δ(𝑣).\r
This shows that Δ is a 𝐺2–invariant polynomial in (𝑣1, 𝑣2).\r
On the other hand, ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ are natural quadratic invariants of the\r
diagonal 𝐺2–action (cf. Moreno [3]). Hence Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) can be expressed as a polynomial in these quantities,\r
so there exists a polynomial 𝐺 such that\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐).\r
Next we consider homogeneity. Since 𝐿𝑠𝑣 = 𝑠𝐿𝑣 for 𝑠 ∈ R, we have\r
Δ(𝑠𝑣) = det(𝑠𝑀(𝑣)) = 𝑠\r
16Δ(𝑣).\r
On the other hand, 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 are all scaled by a factor of 𝑠\r
2\r
, so\r
𝐺(𝑠\r
2\r
𝑎, 𝑠2𝑏, 𝑠2𝑐) = 𝑠\r
16𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)\r
is required. Thus 𝐺 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8.\r
(2) Constraints from symmetry. Consider the operation of swapping 𝑣1 and 𝑣2:\r
(𝑣1, 𝑣2) ↦−→ (𝑣2, 𝑣1).\r
This is an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆 \u001B O ⊕ O, and the corresponding left multiplication matrices are\r
similar, hence\r
Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) = Δ(𝑣2, 𝑣1).\r
Under this operation, 𝑎 and 𝑐 are invariant, while 𝑏 changes sign:\r
(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ↦−→ (𝑎, −𝑏, 𝑐).\r
Thus 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝐺(𝑎, −𝑏, 𝑐), i.e., 𝐺 is an even function of 𝑏.\r
Similarly, consider (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ↦→ (𝑣1, −𝑣2). This is again an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆, and since the\r
corresponding left multiplication matrices are related by similarity, we have\r
Δ(𝑣1, −𝑣2) = Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2).\r
Under this operation, 𝑎 and 𝑏 are invariant and 𝑐 ↦→ −𝑐, so 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, −𝑐), i.e., 𝐺 is an even\r
function of 𝑐.\r
It follows that 𝐺 is even in 𝑏 and 𝑐, so it can be written as a polynomial in 𝑏\r
2\r
and 𝑐\r
2\r
. Equivalently, there\r
exists a polynomial 𝐻 such that\r
𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝐻\r
\r
𝑎, 𝑏2, 𝑐2\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Since 𝐺 is homogeneous of degree 8, 𝐻 must be homogeneous of degree 4 in the variables 𝑎, 𝑏2, 𝑐2.\r
The space of such polynomials is a finite–dimensional vector space, and a basis is given by\r
𝑎\r
4\r
, 𝑎2𝑏\r
2\r
, 𝑎2𝑐\r
2\r
, 𝑏4, 𝑏2𝑐\r
2\r
, 𝑐4.\r
Indeed, since 𝐺 is even in 𝑏 and 𝑐, it can be written as a polynomial in 𝑏\r
2\r
, 𝑐2, and since 𝑎, 𝑏2, 𝑐2are\r
each homogeneous of degree 2 while 𝐺 is homogeneous of degree 8, 𝐺 is restricted to be a homogeneous\r
6

polynomial of degree 4 in 𝑎, 𝑏2\r
, 𝑐2. Therefore, 𝐺 can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the\r
above six monomials, and there exist real coefficients 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, 𝜀, 𝜁 such that\r
𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝛼𝑎4 + 𝛽𝑎2𝑏\r
2 + 𝛾𝑎2\r
𝑐\r
2 + 𝛿𝑏4 + 𝜀𝑏2\r
𝑐\r
2 + 𝜁𝑐4\r
. (1)\r
(3) Determination of the coefficients. We have reduced 𝐺 to a polynomial with six unknown coefficients\r
𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, 𝜀, 𝜁. These coefficients can be determined uniquely by evaluating Δ(𝑣) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) on six\r
carefully chosen triples (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐).\r
To make the linear system explicit, we substitute 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) at\r
(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1)}.\r
For each triple, we pick a concrete 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8 with the prescribed values of 𝑎 = ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
,\r
𝑏 = ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, and 𝑐 = ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩, compute the 16 × 16 matrix 𝑀(𝑣) from Lemma 3.4, and evaluate\r
Δ(𝑣) = det 𝑀(𝑣). Substituting these six values into (1) produces a 6 × 6 linear system in the unknowns\r
𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, 𝜀, 𝜁; the corresponding monomial matrix is of Vandermonde type in (𝑎, 𝑏2, 𝑐2) and is invertible.\r
A straightforward calculation (implemented by the computer algebra script sketched in Appendix A) gives\r
the unique solution\r
𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝑎\r
4\r
(𝑏\r
2 + 4𝑐2\r
)\r
2\r
.\r
Hence\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) =\r

2 + 4⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩2\r
\u00012\r
= 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
for all 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆.\r
(4) Equivalence with the zero–divisor condition. The condition 𝑣 ≠ 0 being a zero divisor is equivalent\r
to Δ(𝑣) = 0, since this is equivalent to the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣 having nontrivial kernel. By\r
Lemma 3.2, we have 𝐷1 (𝑣) = ∥𝑣∥\r
2 > 0 whenever 𝑣 ≠ 0, and therefore\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2 = 0 ⇐⇒ 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0.\r
Thus, 𝑣 ≠ 0 is a zero divisor if and only if 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0. □\r
Corollary 3.7 (Characterization of nonzero zero divisors). A nonzero element 𝑣 ≠ 0 is a zero divisor if and\r
only if\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
hold.\r
Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.3. □\r

and expanding, then collecting like terms, yields the stated form. The calculation involves many terms but\r
each is a simple degree–4 monomial, and the identity can be checked either by hand or with a computer\r
algebra system without difficulty. □\r
4 The Normalized Zero–Divisor Manifold and the Stiefel Manifold\r
As shown in the previous section, nonzero left zero divisors are characterized by 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0, which\r
geometrically corresponds to the conditions\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
for 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8. In this section, we normalize the norm to identify the resulting manifold with a Stiefel\r
manifold.\r
Definition 4.1 (Normalized zero–divisor manifold). Define\r
𝐸 :=\r
n\r
(𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ R\r
8 × R8\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f ∥𝑣1 ∥ = 1, ∥𝑣2 ∥ = 1, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
o\r
.\r
This is the set of all orthonormal 2–frames in R\r
8\r
.\r
Definition 4.2 (Stiefel manifold). In general, the Stiefel manifold𝑉𝑘 (R\r
𝑛\r
) is defined as the set of orthonormal\r
𝑘–frames in R\r
𝑛\r
:\r
𝑉𝑘 (R\r

) :=\r

)\r

\f ⟨𝑒𝑖\r
, 𝑒 𝑗⟩ = 𝛿𝑖 𝑗 \t\r
.\r
Proposition 4.3. 𝐸 is naturally diffeomorphic to 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
).\r
Proof. The map\r
Φ: 𝐸 → 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), Φ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) = (𝑣1, 𝑣2)\r
is clearly well–defined and bijective by definition. Since both 𝐸 and𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) are smooth submanifolds of R\r
8×\r
R\r
8 with the induced smooth structure, and Φ is the restriction of the identity map, it is a diffeomorphism. □\r
Thus, as a smooth manifold, the normalized zero–divisor set is\r
𝐸 \u001B 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
).\r
The Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) admits a fibration\r
𝑆\r
7\r
↩→ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) → 𝑆\r
7\r
,\r
and has rich topological structure. However, since the focus of this work is numerical experiments and\r
visualization, we do not go into the detailed topology here.\r
Theorem 4.4 (Structure of the set of zero divisors). Let 𝑆 be the sedenion algebra obtained from the\r
Cayley–Dickson construction and write elements as 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) with 𝑣1, 𝑣2 ∈ O. Let 𝑍 ⊂ 𝑆 \\ {0} be the set\r
of nontrivial left zero divisors (which we simply call zero divisors in this section).\r
Then 𝑍 admits a natural smooth manifold structure of dimension 14, and there is a natural diffeomorphism\r
𝑍 \u001B (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
),\r
where 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) denotes the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal 2–frames in R\r
8\r
.\r

Proof. We use the notation 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ 𝑆 = O ⊕ O. Recall from Corollary 3.7 that a nonzero element\r
𝑣 ∈ 𝑆 is a left zero divisor if and only if\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0. (2)\r
In particular, for a zero divisor we have ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 = ∥𝑣2 ∥2 > 0, so both 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 are nonzero.\r
Let 𝑍 ⊂ 𝑆 \\ {0} be the set of nontrivial left zero divisors. We first construct an explicit bijection\r
Φ : (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) −→ 𝑍.\r
Step 1: Definition of the map. For (𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) ∈ (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), define\r
Φ(𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) := (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) ∈ 𝑆.\r
Here we identify O with R\r
8\r
in the usual way. Since (𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), we have ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑢2 ∥ = 1 and\r
⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ = 0. Therefore\r
∥𝑟𝑢1 ∥ = 𝑟, ∥𝑟𝑢2 ∥ = 𝑟, ⟨𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2⟩ = 𝑟\r
2\r
⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ = 0.\r
By the characterization (2), Φ(𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) is a (nontrivial) left zero divisor. Thus Φ indeed maps into 𝑍.\r
Step 2: Surjectivity. Let 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ 𝑍 be an arbitrary nontrivial left zero divisor. Then by (2) we have\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ =: 𝑟 > 0, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0.\r
Define\r
𝑢1 :=\r
𝑣1\r
𝑟\r
, 𝑢2 :=\r
𝑣2\r
𝑟\r
.\r
Then ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑢2 ∥ = 1 and ⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ =\r
1\r
𝑟\r
2\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0, so (𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
). Clearly\r
𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) = (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) = Φ𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Thus Φ is surjective.\r
Step 3: Injectivity. Suppose\r
Φ\r
\r
𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)\r
\u0001\r
= Φ𝑠, (𝑤1, 𝑤2)\r
\u0001\r
,\r
i.e. (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) = (𝑠𝑤1, 𝑠𝑤2) for some 𝑟, 𝑠 ∈ (0, ∞) and (𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑤1, 𝑤2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
). Then\r
𝑟𝑢1 = 𝑠𝑤1, 𝑟𝑢2 = 𝑠𝑤2.\r
Taking norms and using ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑤1 ∥ = 1, we obtain\r
𝑟 = ∥𝑟𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑠𝑤1 ∥ = 𝑠.\r
Hence 𝑟 = 𝑠, and it follows that 𝑢1 = 𝑤1 and 𝑢2 = 𝑤2. Thus (𝑢1, 𝑢2) = (𝑤1, 𝑤2) and Φ is injective.\r
Step 4: Smoothness and manifold structure. The map\r
Φ : (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) → 𝑆 \\ {0}\r
is clearly smooth, being polynomial in the coordinates. Its inverse\r
Ψ : 𝑍 −→ (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), Ψ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) :=\r
\u0010\r
∥𝑣1 ∥,\r
\r
𝑣1\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
,\r
𝑣2\r
∥𝑣2 ∥\r
\u0001\r
\u0011\r
is well-defined on 𝑍, because (2) implies ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ > 0 and hence both 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 are nonzero. It is\r
also smooth, as it is given by smooth algebraic operations (in particular, division by a positive scalar). Thus\r
Φ is a diffeomorphism between (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) and 𝑍, which endows 𝑍 with a natural smooth manifold\r
structure.\r
Since dim𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) = 2 · 8 −\r
2·3\r
2\r
= 13, we obtain\r
dim 𝑍 = 1 + dim𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) = 14.\r
Because 𝑆 \\ {0} has dimension 16, the set 𝑍 has codimension 2 in 𝑆 \\ {0}. □\r

5 Cyclic Permutation Slice and Local Model\r
In this section, we analyze 𝐷2 on a specific 3–dimensional linear slice and show that its zero set is given by\r
the quadratic cone 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0. This can be interpreted as a local model for the singular structure\r
of the zero–divisor set.\r
5.1 Definition of the cyclic permutation slice\r
Definition 5.1 (Cyclic permutation slice). For parameters 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍 ∈ R, consider two 8–dimensional vectors\r
𝑣1 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, 𝑐, 0, 0, 0, 0),\r
𝑣2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = (𝑌, 𝑍, 𝑋, 0, 𝑐, 0, 0, 0),\r
where 𝑐 > 0 is a fixed constant (we use 𝑐 =\r
1\r
2\r
in numerical experiments). Then\r
𝐿 := {(𝑣1 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍), 𝑣2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍)) | 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍 ∈ R}\r
is a 3–dimensional linear subspace of R\r
8 × R8 ≃ R16. The restriction of 𝐷2 to 𝐿 is called the local model\r
on the cyclic permutation slice in this paper.\r
Remark 5.2 (Motivation for choosing the cyclic permutation slice). The cyclic permutation slice used in\r
this work is chosen for two main reasons. First, by preserving the cyclic symmetry in the indices of (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍),\r
we can expect 𝐷2 to be expressed in terms of a symmetric quadratic form such as 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋. Second,\r
for a general zero divisor (𝑣1, 𝑣2), it is expected that, via the action of 𝐺2 and scalar rescaling, one can\r
reduce to a normal form lying in some 3–dimensional subspace; the present slice serves as a prototype\r
of such a reduction. In this paper we do not rigorously discuss to what extent this slice represents the\r
singular structure of the entire zero–divisor set, but numerical experiments show that the quadratic cone\r
𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0 indeed appears as a typical local model.\r
5.2 Norms and inner products\r
Lemma 5.3. For the above 𝑣1, 𝑣2 we have\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 = 𝑋2 + 𝑌2 + 𝑍2 + 𝑐2\r
, ∥𝑣2 ∥\r
2 = 𝑋2 + 𝑌2 + 𝑍2 + 𝑐2\r
,\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋.\r
Proof. The component vector of 𝑣1 is (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, 𝑐, 0, 0, 0, 0), so\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 = 𝑋2 + 𝑌2 + 𝑍2 + 𝑐2\r
.\r
Similarly, 𝑣2 = (𝑌, 𝑍, 𝑋, 0, 𝑐, 0, 0, 0), hence\r
∥𝑣2 ∥\r
2 = 𝑌2 + 𝑍2 + 𝑋2 + 𝑐2 = 𝑋2 + 𝑌2 + 𝑍2 + 𝑐2\r
.\r
For the inner product we have\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 𝑋 · 𝑌 + 𝑌 · 𝑍 + 𝑍 · 𝑋 + 𝑐 · 0 + 0 · 𝑐 + 0 · 0 + 0 · 0 + 0 · 0,\r
and thus\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋.\r
□\r

5.3 The local model theorem\r
Theorem 5.4 (Local model on the cyclic permutation slice). On the cyclic permutation slice 𝐿, the factor\r
𝐷2 is given by\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
.\r
Hence the zero–divisor condition 𝐷2 = 0 agrees with the quadratic cone\r
𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0.\r
Proof. From Definition 3.1 and Lemma 5.3, we have\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2 = 0, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋.\r
Therefore\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) =\r
\u0010\r
∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
\u00112\r
+ 4 ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩\r
2\r
= 0\r
2 + 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)2\r
= 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
.\r
Since 4 ≠ 0, the condition 𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 0 is equivalent to\r
(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2 = 0,\r
and over the reals this is equivalent to\r
𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0.\r
□\r
Remark 5.5 (Singular structure). The gradient of the quadratic form\r
𝑄(𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋\r
is given by\r
∇𝑄 = (𝑌 + 𝑍, 𝑋 + 𝑍, 𝑋 + 𝑌).\r
The condition ∇𝑄 = 0 yields\r
𝑌 + 𝑍 = 0, 𝑋 + 𝑍 = 0, 𝑋 + 𝑌 = 0,\r
whose simultaneous solution is (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = (0, 0, 0) only. Thus, the quadratic cone 𝑄 = 0 has an isolated\r
singularity at the origin, and the local structure of the zero–divisor set on the cyclic permutation slice can\r
be understood as the neighborhood of this singularity. It is an ordinary double point (type 𝐴1) in this\r
3–dimensional slice, capturing the simplest nontrivial singularity compatible with the symmetries of the\r
model.\r
5.4 2D slices and 3D isosurfaces\r
If we fix 𝑍 = 0, Theorem 5.4 gives\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 0) = 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 0 + 0)\r
2 = 4 (𝑋𝑌)2\r
,\r
so the zero set is\r
𝑋𝑌 = 0,\r
i.e., 𝑋 = 0 or 𝑌 = 0. Thus, on the plane 𝑍 = 0, the zero set forms a cross through the origin.\r
In the numerical experiment, we compute 𝐷2 (𝑋𝑖, 𝑌𝑗, 0) on a grid of points (𝑋𝑖, 𝑌𝑗, 0) and visualize\r
log(1 + 𝐷2) as a color map, confirming that the values are small along 𝑋 = 0 and 𝑌 = 0 (Figure 1, left).\r
Furthermore, plotting the contour of the region where 𝐷2 < 𝜀 for a small threshold 𝜀 > 0, we observe good\r
agreement with the theoretical curves 𝑋 = 0 and 𝑌 = 0 (Figure 1, right).\r
11

𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 0)). Right: contour 𝐷2 = 𝜀 (red) compared with the theoretical lines 𝑋 = 0 and 𝑌 = 0 (blue\r

2\r
. Grid: 81×81, threshold\r
𝜀 = 0.01.\r
We also compute 𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) on a three–dimensional grid and extract the isosurface\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 𝜀\r
for a fixed level 𝜀 using the marching cubes method, thereby visualizing the 𝜀–neighborhood of the quadratic\r
cone 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0 in 3D. Specifically, we sample (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) uniformly in [−𝑅, 𝑅]\r
3 with 𝑅 = 1\r
and 𝑁 = 81 grid points per direction, evaluate 𝐷2 at each node, and run a standard marching cubes\r
implementation to recover the level set. This isosurface has the shape of a saddle–like double cone,\r
providing an intuitive picture of the singular structure near the origin.\r
Figure 2: Isosurface of the local zero–divisor factor 𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) at level 𝐷2 = 𝜀; color encodes ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ on\r
the surface. The surface is a numerical approximation of the quadratic cone 𝑋𝑌 +𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0, visualising\r
the isolated singularity at the origin (grid: 𝑁 = 81, 𝜀 = 0.01).\r
Remark 5.6 (Numerical stability). Varying the grid size 𝑁 = 40, 80, 120 and the threshold 𝜀 = 10−3, 10−4,\r
we confirm that the cross–shaped slice corresponding to 𝑋𝑌 = 0 and the shape of the quadratic cone\r
12

remain qualitatively unchanged, indicating that the topological structure of the 𝜀–neighborhood is stable\r
with respect to these choices.\r
6 Holonomy of the Zero–Divisor Frame Bundle\r
In the previous sections we have seen that, after normalization, the nonzero zero–divisor set\r
𝐸 =\r
\b\r
(𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ R\r
8 × R8\r
\f\r
\f ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ = 1, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
\t\r
can be identified with the Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
). The Stiefel manifold is usually defined as\r
𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) :=\r
\b\r
(𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ R\r
8 × R8\r
\f\r
\f ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ = 1, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
\t\r
,\r
so 𝐸 coincides with this standard definition. The homogeneous description 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) = 𝑆𝑂(8)/𝑆𝑂(6) and\r
related symmetric-space features are developed in Helgason [10]. In this section we consider the Levi–\r
Civita connection induced by the Euclidean metric on this zero–divisor frame bundle and visualize its\r
parallel transport as curves on a torus.\r
The update rule used here refines the earlier ad hoc numerical connection and is instead regarded\r
as a first–order Euler approximation to the Levi–Civita connection induced by the Euclidean metric on\r
𝐸 ⊂ (R\r
8\r
)\r
2\r
. Thus it is not an ad hoc rule, but a natural parallel transport algorithm based on a standard\r
geometric structure.\r
6.1 Discrete approximation of the Levi–Civita connection\r
The submanifold 𝐸 ⊂ (R\r
8\r
)\r
2\r
inherits a natural Riemannian metric from the standard inner product on R\r
8\r
, and\r
the orthogonal projection formula exhibits the induced Levi–Civita connection as detailed in Petersen [11],\r
⟨(𝑥1, 𝑥2), (𝑦1, 𝑦2)⟩𝐸 := ⟨𝑥1, 𝑦1⟩ + ⟨𝑥2, 𝑦2⟩.\r
The Levi–Civita connection of this metric is defined, for an embedded submanifold, by projecting the\r
ambient derivative in R\r
16 orthogonally onto the tangent space.\r
In numerical experiments, we fix a time step Δ𝑡 > 0 and consider a discrete curve\r
𝑡𝑘 = 𝑘Δ𝑡, (𝑣1 (𝑡𝑘), 𝑣2 (𝑡𝑘)) ∈ 𝐸,\r
parametrized by 𝑡 ∈ [0, 2𝜋]. In this paper, we prescribe 𝑣1 (𝑡) as a known loop on 𝑆\r
7\r
, and update 𝑣2 (𝑡) in\r
such a way that it changes as little as possible while preserving the orthonormality, which yields a discrete\r
approximation of the connection.\r
Definition 6.1 (Euler–type discrete approximation of the Levi–Civita connection). Suppose that at time 𝑡\r
we have a frame (𝑣1 (𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡)) ∈ 𝐸, and that the new first vector at time 𝑡 + Δ𝑡,\r
𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) ∈ 𝑆\r
7\r
,\r
is given. We define the new second vector 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) in two steps:\r
1. First, project 𝑣2 (𝑡) onto the subspace orthogonal to the new vector 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡):\r
𝑣˜2 := 𝑣2 (𝑡) − ⟨𝑣2 (𝑡), 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡). (3)\r
2. Then normalize 𝑣˜2 to obtain\r
𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) :=\r
𝑣˜2\r
∥𝑣˜2 ∥\r
. (4)\r

Pseudo–code\r
Input: (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ 𝐸, 𝑣new\r

) ∈ 𝐸\r
This projection–plus–normalization rule coincides with the simple update rule previously used as a numer\u0002ical connection, and it can now be directly understood as a first–order approximation to the Levi–Civita\r
connection. For an embedded submanifold 𝑀 ⊂ R\r
𝑁 with induced metric, the Levi–Civita connection\r
satisfies\r

,\r
the orthogonal projection of the ambient derivative. The map sending (𝑣1 (𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡)) to (𝑣1 (𝑡+Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡+Δ𝑡))\r
via the above two-step rule simply applies the ambient update and then orthogonally projects back to\r
𝑇𝑣1 (𝑡+Δ𝑡) 𝑆\r
7 before renormalizing, so it acts as a discrete approximation of parallel transport on 𝐸.\r
Geometrically, this procedure can be interpreted as follows: when 𝑣1 rotates slightly, 𝑣2 is rotated as\r
little as possible so that it remains of unit length and orthogonal to the new 𝑣1.\r
Lemma 6.2 (Preservation of orthonormality). If (𝑣1 (𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡)) ∈ 𝐸 is updated to (𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡))\r
according to Definition 6.1, then (𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)) ∈ 𝐸 holds; that is,\r
∥𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) ∥ = ∥𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) ∥ = 1, ⟨𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ = 0\r
are preserved.\r
Proof. We assume by construction that 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) has norm 1. From the definition of ˜𝑣2 we have\r
⟨𝑣˜2, 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ = ⟨𝑣2 (𝑡), 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ − ⟨𝑣2 (𝑡), 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩⟨𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩\r
= 0,\r
so ˜𝑣2 is orthogonal to 𝑣1 (𝑡+Δ𝑡). Since 𝑣2 (𝑡+Δ𝑡) is obtained by normalizing ˜𝑣2, we have both ∥𝑣2 (𝑡+Δ𝑡) ∥ = 1\r
and ⟨𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ = 0. □\r
This update rule can be regarded as an Euler discretization of the induced connection on 𝐸 when\r
embedded into R\r
16\r
.\r
Proposition 6.3 (First–order approximation of the Levi–Civita connection). In the limit Δ𝑡 → 0, the update\r
rule in Definition 6.1 approximates the parallel transport induced by the Levi–Civita connection on 𝐸 to\r
first order.\r
Sketch of proof. The Levi–Civita parallel transport on 𝑆\r
7 preserves length while staying in the tangent space\r
and is characterized by minimizing rotation. On 𝐸 \u001B 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), the tangent space satisfies\r
𝑣¤2 ⊥ 𝑣1, ⟨ ¤𝑣2, 𝑣2⟩ = 0,\r
and the Levi–Civita connection again chooses 𝑣¤2 so that the frame evolves with minimal rotation.\r
In Definition 6.1, 𝑣1 is updated along a curve on 𝑆\r
7\r
, and then 𝑣2 is projected orthogonally onto the new\r
tangent space 𝑇𝑣1 (𝑡+Δ𝑡) 𝑆\r
7\r
and renormalized. This is precisely the projection formula used in the definition\r
of the induced connection on an embedded submanifold. Ultimately, differentiating the discrete update rule\r
with respect to 𝑡 and comparing with the defining equation for Levi–Civita parallel transport shows that the\r
error is of order 𝑂(Δ𝑡\r
2\r
), hence the approximation is first–order accurate. For conciseness, we omit the full\r
technical details here. □\r

6.2 Projection to a torus and holonomy curves\r
We next extract two angles from the frame (𝑣1 (𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡)) on 𝐸 and project them onto a torus\r
𝑆\r
1\r
base × 𝑆\r
1\r
fiber.\r
Definition 6.4 (Projection to a torus). Fix the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane in R\r
8 and define the base angle by\r
𝜃(𝑡) := arg𝑣\r
0\r
1\r
(𝑡) + 𝑖 𝑣1\r
1\r
(𝑡)\r
\u0001\r
along the great circle in that plane. We then project 𝑣2 (𝑡) onto the same 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane; when this projection\r
is nonzero we take its argument to define the fiber angle\r
𝜙(𝑡) := arg𝑣\r
0\r
2\r
(𝑡) + 𝑖 𝑣1\r
2\r
(𝑡)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Taking 𝜃, 𝜙 modulo 2𝜋 we regard\r
(𝜃(𝑡), 𝜙(𝑡)) ∈ 𝑆\r
1\r
base × 𝑆\r
1\r
fiber\r
as a point on the torus whenever 𝜙 is defined. In the numerical experiments underlying Proposition 6.5,\r
the chosen initial frame has 𝑣2 (0) projecting nontrivially to the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane, and the projection remained\r
nonzero throughout the simulation, so the fiber angle was well-defined along the sampled loop.\r
In the numerical experiment, we choose 𝑣1 (𝑡) to be the great circle in the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane,\r
𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡, sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0), 𝑡 ∈ [0, 2𝜋].\r
We take Δ𝑡 sufficiently small, update 𝑣2 (𝑡𝑘) according to Definition 6.1, and compute (𝜃(𝑡𝑘), 𝜙(𝑡𝑘)) at each\r
step.\r
Plotting the point sequence (𝜃(𝑡𝑘), 𝜙(𝑡𝑘)) in the unit square [0, 2𝜋) × [0, 2𝜋) while identifying opposite\r
edges as a torus, we obtain a nearly diagonal closed curve shown in Figure 3. This suggests that when the\r
base loop winds once, the fiber angle also winds approximately once, indicating a (1, 1)–type holonomy.\r
Figure 3: Numerical holonomy of the zero–divisor frame bundle projected to the torus 𝑆\r

fiber. The\r
base angle 𝜃 is on the horizontal axis and the fiber angle 𝜙 on the vertical axis. The curve appears as an\r
essentially (1, 1)–type closed curve, winding once in each direction as the base loop closes. (Numerical\r

To evaluate the holonomy more quantitatively, we define an unwrapped fiber angle 𝜙˜(𝑡) by removing 2𝜋\r
jumps from 𝜙(𝑡), and plot it as a function of 𝜃(𝑡). Figure 4 shows this plot, with 𝜃 on the horizontal axis\r
and 𝜙˜ on the vertical axis. A least–squares linear fit yields\r
𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const.,\r
indicating a linear relation with slope close to 1.\r
Observation 6.5 (Numerical holonomy for the great circle). For the base loop 𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡,sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0)\r
and the discrete parallel transport scheme in Definition 6.1, the numerically observed holonomy transfor\u0002mation exhibits the following qualitative behaviour:\r
(i) it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the oriented two–plane spanned by the zero–divisor frame (𝑣1, 𝑣2);\r
(ii) it is close to the identity on the orthogonal complement of this two–plane.\r
In other words, the holonomy is typically of (1, 1)–type with respect to the decompositionR\r
8 = span{𝑣1, 𝑣2}⊕\r
span{𝑣1, 𝑣2}\r
⊥, and the unwrapped slope 𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const. provides numerical evidence for this behaviour.\r
Remark 6.6. We emphasize that Observation 6.5 is based solely on numerical experiments using a simple\r
Euler integrator for the Levi–Civita connection. At present we do not claim a rigorous theorem asserting\r
that the holonomy is exactly of (1, 1)–type for the true Levi–Civita connection on the sedenionic zero–divisor\r
frame manifold; we regard these computations as evidence for such behaviour and as motivation for future\r
analytic work.\r
Lemma 6.7 (Toy model for (1, 1)–type holonomy). Consider the flat product manifold 𝑀 := (𝑆\r
1 ×𝑆1\r
) ×R\r
𝑘\r
with the standard product metric, and let 𝐸 → 𝑀 be the trivial rank–𝑛 bundle with the Levi–Civita\r
connection induced from the ambient Euclidean space R\r
𝑛\r
. Fix an orthogonal decomposition R\r
𝑛 = 𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈⊥\r
with dim𝑈 = 2, and suppose that along 𝑀 the subbundle 𝑈 is tangent to the 𝑆\r
1 × 𝑆1–directions while 𝑈⊥\r
is constant.\r
Then the holonomy of the Levi–Civita connection along any fundamental loop of 𝑆\r
1 × 𝑆1\r
is a rotation\r
in 𝑈 and the identity on 𝑈\r
⊥. In particular, the holonomy is of (1, 1)–type with respect to the decomposition\r
𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈\r
⊥.\r
Proof sketch. Since the metric on 𝑀 is flat and of product type, the Levi–Civita connection on 𝑇 𝑀 is trivial\r
in the R\r
𝑘–directions and reduces to the standard flat connection on each 𝑆1\r
factor. The bundle 𝐸 is trivial\r
with the constant splitting 𝐸 = 𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈\r
⊥, and by assumption the connection preserves both subbundles.\r
Along a fundamental loop in one 𝑆\r
1–direction, the parallel transport in 𝑈⊥ is therefore the identity, while\r
in 𝑈 it is given by a rotation of some angle (completely determined by the chosen frame along 𝑆\r
1\r
). Since\r
the two 𝑆\r
1–directions commute and the connection is flat, the holonomy along any (𝑚, 𝑛)–cycle in 𝑆1 × 𝑆1\r
is again a pure rotation in 𝑈 and the identity on 𝑈\r
⊥. □\r
Remark 6.8. Lemma 6.7 should be viewed only as a simplified caricature of the situation on the genuine\r
zero–divisor frame manifold, where the metric is curved and the splitting into the zero–divisor plane and its\r
orthogonal complement is not globally parallel. However, our numerical experiments suggest that, at least\r
along the torus–type loops considered in this section, the qualitative (1, 1)–type behaviour of the holonomy\r
persists. We regard this as evidence that the zero–divisor frame manifold inherits a geometric structure\r
reminiscent of the toy model above.\r
In the numerical experiments underlying Observation 6.5, we choose a generic initial frame (𝑣1 (0), 𝑣2 (0)) ∈\r
𝐸 with 𝑣2 (0) having a nonzero projection to the base 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane. We vary the time discretization param\u0002eter Δ𝑡 = 2𝜋/num steps with num steps ∈ {100, 200, 400, 800} and find that the least–squares slope 𝑘 in\r
𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝑘𝜃 + const. remains stably close to 1 (typically 𝑘 = 1.00 ± 10−3). This indicates that the observed\r
(1, 1)–type holonomy is not an artifact of a particular discretization or initial condition.\r
The curvature tensor of the induced Levi–Civita connection on the Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) is homoge\u0002neous under the 𝑆𝑂(8)–action. The observed (1, 1)–type holonomy can be regarded as a concrete example\r
of an area–proportional phase caused by this curvature, analogous to the Berry phase in physics (cf. do\r
Carmo [12]). In this paper we confine ourselves to this qualitative discussion; a more detailed computation\r
of the curvature and its representation–theoretic description are left as future work.\r

7 Discussion\r
In this paper we have constructed fundamental factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2 of the determinant of the sedenion left\r
multiplication matrix,\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
,\r
and shown that 𝐷2 is the quartic polynomial that vanishes exactly under the geometric conditions\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0.\r
This gives a characterization of nonzero zero divisors via 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0. The geometric condition itself is\r
consistent with previous works such as Moreno [3] on zero divisors in Cayley–Dickson algebras, but the\r
present work is distinctive in providing it as an explicit determinant factor 𝐷2 in a form that can be directly\r
used for local modeling and visualization.\r
On the cyclic permutation slice, 𝐷2 simplifies to\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
,\r
so that its zero set is the quadratic cone 𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0. This is a concrete example showing that the\r
local structure of the zero–divisor set can be described as the zero set of a quadratic form in an appropriate\r
coordinate system. The slice used here is chosen as a typical model of reduction by the action of 𝐺2 and\r
scalar rescaling. An important future problem is to clarify, via the structure of 𝐺2–orbits and normal forms,\r
to what extent this quadratic cone model appears universally for general zero divisors.\r
We have also introduced a discrete Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold\r
𝐸 \u001B 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) and visualized its holonomy as curves on a torus. The observation that the holonomy of the\r
base great circle loop forms a (1, 1)–type closed curve suggests that the zero–divisor frame bundle has a\r
geometric structure that twists once per loop. The discretization adopted here can be seen as a numerical\r
approximation of a natural 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariant connection, but since the sedenion multiplication is closely\r
related to the action of the exceptional group 𝐺2, it is expected that comparing the holonomy with the\r
standard representation of 𝑆𝑂(8) and its restriction to 𝐺2 will yield a more algebraic understanding. In\r
this paper we do not go into these details and focus instead on visualization and observation, but a more\r
systematic analysis of the curvature tensor and representation–theoretic structure is an important direction\r
for future work.\r
From a symmetry viewpoint, the observed (1, 1)–type holonomy is also natural. The Stiefel manifold\r
𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) can be regarded as the homogeneous space 𝑆𝑂(8)/𝑆𝑂(6) equipped with the 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariant\r
Riemannian metric, and the Levi–Civita connection is uniquely determined by this symmetry. Our base\r
17

loop 𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡,sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0) arises from the action of a one-parameter subgroup 𝑆𝑂(2) ⊂ 𝑆𝑂(8)\r
rotating the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane. In such a highly symmetric situation, there is essentially a unique natural scale\r
for the holonomy along one full rotation, and the simplest nontrivial possibility is that the frame twists\r
once when the base vector rotates once. The numerically observed slope 𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const. can therefore\r
be interpreted as a manifestation of this 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariance, analogous to how the holonomy on a sphere is\r
determined solely by the enclosed area of a loop.\r
A natural next step would be to substantiate the observed (1, 1)–type holonomy by a more systematic\r
numerical study. One can investigate the convergence of the slope in Observation 6.5 as the step size\r
Δ𝑡 → 0, the dependence on the initial frame and the great circle choice, and the behavior under global\r
𝑆𝑂(8)–rotations of the entire configuration. Moreover, by deforming the base loop within the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane\r
(e.g. to ellipses) and comparing the resulting holonomy with the enclosed area, it should be possible to\r
test an area law analogous to the Berry phase on spheres. Similar phenomena have been studied in sub\u0002Riemannian visualizations such as Montgomery [13] and Bullo–Lewis [14]. We leave a detailed numerical\r
and theoretical analysis of these questions to future work.\r
8 Conclusion\r
In this paper, we have visualized and analyzed the geometric structure of the sedenion zero–divisor set along\r
the following three main lines:\r
• We constructed fundamental factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2 such that the determinant of the left multiplication matrix\r
satisfies\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
,\r
and showed that nonzero zero divisors are characterized by the condition 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0.\r
• We analyzed 𝐷2 on the cyclic permutation slice and derived the local model\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
,\r
confirming via 2D/3D visualization that the local singular structure is given by the quadratic cone\r
𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0.\r
• We introduced a discrete Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold and visu\u0002alized its holonomy as curves on a torus, thereby observing geometric twisting in the zero–divisor\r
frame bundle.\r
These results constitute a basic attempt to understand the zero–divisor geometry of an abstract nondivi\u0002sion algebra via explicit polynomials and computer graphics. Future directions include extending the analysis\r
to more general slices and higher Cayley–Dickson algebras, comparing different natural 𝐺2–invariant con\u0002nections, and elucidating the relations between curvature and topology. In particular, investigating the\r
homotopy classification of zero–divisor frame bundles based on the action of 𝐺2 and analyzing the curva\u0002ture structure of natural connections appear to be key steps toward embedding the visualizations obtained\r
here into a more algebraic framework.\r
A Outline of the coefficient determination in Theorem 3.6\r
In this appendix we briefly summarize the procedure for determining the coefficients in the proof of\r
Theorem 3.6.\r

Using the standard basis 𝑒0, . . . , 𝑒7 of O, we choose six pairs (𝑣\r

(𝑘)\r
:= det 𝑀\r
\r
𝑣\r

of the left multiplication matrix 𝑀(𝑣\r

).\r
Substituting these into\r
𝐺\r
\r
𝑎\r
(𝑘)\r
, 𝑏(𝑘), 𝑐(𝑘)\r
\u0001\r

In practice, we use Python/SymPy to compute both the determinants of 𝑀(𝑣\r

) and the entries of 𝐴\r
as rational polynomials, verify that 𝐴 is invertible, and find the unique solution. The accompanying script\r
constructs 𝑀(𝑣) from Lemma 3.4, substitutes the six test pairs (𝑣\r

assembles the matrix 𝐴 of monomials in (𝑎\r

We use a similar approach to determine the coefficient matrix and verify that the linear system has a unique\r
solution even for other choices of representative elements. The coefficient matrix 𝐴 is invertible, and the\r
unique solution is given by\r
𝛼 = 1, 𝛽 = 0, 𝛾 = 4, 𝛿 = 0, 𝜀 = 0, 𝜁 = 0.\r

Singular Structures and Geometric Holonomy in the\r
Zero–Divisor Set of the Sedenions\r

Abstract\r
We study zero divisors in the 16–dimensional sedenion algebra from an explicit deter\u0002minantal and geometric viewpoint. For the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣 we prove\r
that\r
det 𝐿𝑣 = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
,\r
where 𝐷1 and 𝐷2 are quartic polynomials in the octonion components 𝑣1, 𝑣2 of 𝑣, and\r
nonzero zero divisors are characterized by 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0. Here 𝐷1 coincides with the\r
squared norm of 𝑣, while 𝐷2 recovers the classical geometric condition ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥,\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 known in work of Moreno and others, but now as an explicit determinant\r
factor.\r
On a carefully chosen 3–dimensional linear slice we derive a local model 𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) =\r
4(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
, so that the zero–divisor set is described there by the quadratic\r
cone 𝑋𝑌 +𝑌 𝑍 +𝑍 𝑋 = 0, and we confirm this by 2D/3D numerical visualization. After\r
normalization, the nontrivial zero divisors form the Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
); on this\r
space we introduce a simple discrete approximation to the Levi–Civita connection and\r
compute its holonomy along a great circle. Projected to a torus of base/fiber angles, the\r
resulting holonomy appears as a concrete (1, 1)–type twisting curve. This illustrates\r
how explicit polynomials and computer graphics can reveal geometric structure in a\r
highly nonassociative algebra."""

Via the Cayley–Dickson construction, starting from the field of real numbers R, one obtains the complex\r
numbers, quaternions, octonions, and then the 16–dimensional nondivision algebra known as the sedenions.\r
The sedenions lose both associativity and divisibility, but are interesting in that they possess many zero\r
divisors. However, the geometric structure of the zero–divisor set is high–dimensional, and it is difficult to\r
grasp its behavior intuitively.\r
Existing works have shown that the zero–divisor sets of the octonions and the sedenions are related to\r
Stiefel manifolds and the exceptional Lie group 𝐺2, but the framework there is primarily topological or\r
Riemannian–geometric, and there has been comparatively little understanding via explicit polynomials and\r
visualization (see, for example, Moreno [3]). The zero–divisor condition\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0\r
used in this paper is itself already known in the literature on zero divisors in Cayley–Dickson algebras,\r
such as Moreno [3]. The novelty of the present study lies in recasting this condition as a concrete quartic\r

Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
of the 16×16 real matrix corresponding to left multiplication, and presenting it in a form that can be directly\r
utilized for local models, numerical visualization, and holonomy analysis.\r
In this paper, we focus on the left multiplication matrix of the sedenions and factorize its determinant\r
Δ(𝑣) = det 𝑀(𝑣) explicitly in order to extract two essential factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2 for zero–divisor detection. In\r
particular, 𝐷2 is the factor that characterizes nonzero zero divisors, and its zero set reflects the geometric\r
structure of the zero–divisor set. Beyond making the classical condition |𝑣1| = |𝑣2|, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 appear\r
as a determinant factor, we analyze 𝐷2 on a specific 3–dimensional linear slice and show that the local\r
singular structure is given by the quadratic cone 𝑋𝑌 +𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0, and we define a discrete version of the\r
Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold to visualize its holonomy as curves on a\r
torus.\r
Related work\r
The algebraic and geometric pathology of the sedenions has been discussed from several perspectives.\r
Conway–Smith [2] and Baez [1] emphasized the loss of alternativity and the proliferation of zero divisors\r
once one leaves the octonions, and Moreno [3] gave an explicit description of zero divisors in terms of pairs\r
of orthogonal octonions of equal norm.\r
Eakin–Sathaye [4], Albuquerque–Majid [7], and Okubo [5, 6] study the algebraic properties of Cayley–\r
Dickson algebras that underpin our block matrix decompositions. Standard treatments of Cayley–Dickson\r
algebras and their homogeneous spaces appear in Schafer [9]. In particular, the conditions ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 for the octonionic components (𝑣1, 𝑣2) are classical.\r
To our knowledge, however, these conditions have not been systematically reinterpreted in terms of the\r
determinant of the left multiplication operator, nor has the quartic factor 𝐷2 been written out explicitly in\r
𝐺2–invariant coordinates. Likewise, while the singular nature of the zero–divisor variety is well known, we\r
are not aware of previous work that isolates a concrete three–dimensional slice with a simple double-cone\r
model or that connects the zero–divisor geometry to numerical experiments on Levi–Civita holonomy over\r
the associated Stiefel manifold.\r
Main contributions\r
The geometric and algebraic structure of zero divisors in the sedenions has been investigated from various\r
viewpoints, but several aspects remain only implicitly understood. In this note we isolate and clarify three\r
features that we regard as conceptually useful.\r
(C1) We reinterpret the classical zero–divisor conditions ∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0 (which go back\r
at least to Moreno and are implicit in the work of Conway–Smith and Baez) as the vanishing of a\r
distinguished quartic factor 𝐷2 in the determinant of the left multiplication operator 𝐿𝑣. In particular,\r
we give an explicit factorization\r
det 𝐿𝑣 = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4 𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
in terms of the standard 𝐺2–invariant scalar triple (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) on the imaginary octonion components\r
and identify 𝐷2 = 0 as the decisive algebraic condition for the zero–divisor locus.\r
(C2) We restrict 𝐷2 to a simple 3–dimensional linear slice of the zero–divisor variety and obtain the\r
concrete equation\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4 (𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
.\r
This shows that, at least along this slice, the zero–divisor set is modeled by the double cone 𝑋𝑌 +\r
𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0. We propose this as a canonical local prototype for singularities of the zero–divisor\r
variety and illustrate its geometry via explicit computer graphics.\r
(C3) On the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal zero–divisor pairs (which we informally regard as the zero–\r
divisor frame bundle), we numerically study the Levi–Civita parallel transport along natural torus–type\r
loops. Using a simple Euler-type integrator, we observe that the resulting holonomy generically has\r
(1, 1)–type: it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the span of the two zero divisors and is close to the\r
2

identity on the orthogonal complement. This provides an initial link between the singular algebraic\r
geometry of zero divisors and the Riemannian holonomy of the associated frame space.\r
The structure of the paper is as follows. In §2 we present the minimal preliminaries on the Cayley–\r
Dickson construction and the definition of the left multiplication operator. In §3 we derive the factorization\r
of the determinant of the left multiplication matrix and present Δ = 𝐷\r
4\r
1𝐷\r
2\r
2\r
as a main theorem. In §4\r
we discuss the identification of the normalized zero–divisor manifold with the Stiefel manifold. In §5 we\r
analyze and visualize the local model of 𝐷2 on a cyclic permutation slice. In §6 we describe the visualization\r
of the holonomy. Finally, in §7 and §8 we give discussion and conclusions."""

The Cayley–Dickson construction gives a procedure to obtain the complex numbers, quaternions, octonions,\r

∥𝑣∥\r
2 = 𝐷1 (𝑣) = ∥𝑣1 ∥2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r

Proof. In the Cayley–Dickson construction, the inner product is defined by\r
⟨𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8, 𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8⟩ = ⟨𝑣1, 𝑤1⟩ + ⟨𝑣2, 𝑤2⟩.\r
In particular, setting 𝑤 = 𝑣 gives\r

With these preparations in hand, we now state the main result of this section.\r
Theorem 3.6 (Determinant factorization for sedenion left multiplication). For any 𝑣 ∈ 𝑆, the determinant\r

(1) Reduction to invariants. The automorphism group 𝐺2 of the octonions preserves the norm and inner\r
product and also preserves the Cayley–Dickson multiplication and left multiplication matrices (see, for\r
example, Baez [1], Bryant [8], and Moreno [3]). Extending the action to 𝑆 \u001B O ⊕ O by\r
𝑔(𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8) := 𝑔𝑣1 + 𝑔𝑣2𝑒8\r
5

for 𝑔 ∈ 𝐺2, we obtain an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆. Moreover, using the fact that 𝑔 is an automorphism\r
of O and commutes with conjugation, we have\r
𝑔\r
\r
(𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8) (𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑒8)\r
\u0001\r
= 𝑔(𝑣1𝑤1 − 𝑤2𝑣2) + 𝑔(𝑣2𝑤1 + 𝑤2𝑣1)𝑒8\r
= (𝑔𝑣1) (𝑔𝑤1) − 𝑔𝑤2 (𝑔𝑣2) + (𝑔𝑣2) 𝑔𝑤1 + (𝑔𝑤2) (𝑔𝑣1)\r
\u0001\r
𝑒8\r
= (𝑔𝑣1 + 𝑔𝑣2𝑒8) (𝑔𝑤1 + 𝑔𝑤2𝑒8).\r
Thus 𝑔 is an algebra automorphism on 𝑆, and there exists an orthogonal matrix 𝑇𝑔 such that\r
𝑀(𝑔𝑣) = 𝑇𝑔𝑀(𝑣)𝑇\r
−1\r
𝑔\r
,\r
and hence\r
Δ(𝑔𝑣) = det(𝑇𝑔𝑀(𝑣)𝑇\r
−1\r
𝑔\r
) = Δ(𝑣).\r
This shows that Δ is a 𝐺2–invariant polynomial in (𝑣1, 𝑣2).\r
On the other hand, ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ are natural quadratic invariants of the\r
diagonal 𝐺2–action (cf. Moreno [3]). Hence Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) can be expressed as a polynomial in these quantities,\r
so there exists a polynomial 𝐺 such that\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐).\r
Next we consider homogeneity. Since 𝐿𝑠𝑣 = 𝑠𝐿𝑣 for 𝑠 ∈ R, we have\r
Δ(𝑠𝑣) = det(𝑠𝑀(𝑣)) = 𝑠\r
16Δ(𝑣).\r
On the other hand, 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 are all scaled by a factor of 𝑠\r
2\r
, so\r
𝐺(𝑠\r
2\r
𝑎, 𝑠2𝑏, 𝑠2𝑐) = 𝑠\r
16𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)\r
is required. Thus 𝐺 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8.\r
(2) Constraints from symmetry. Consider the operation of swapping 𝑣1 and 𝑣2:\r
(𝑣1, 𝑣2) ↦−→ (𝑣2, 𝑣1).\r
This is an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆 \u001B O ⊕ O, and the corresponding left multiplication matrices are\r
similar, hence\r
Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2) = Δ(𝑣2, 𝑣1).\r
Under this operation, 𝑎 and 𝑐 are invariant, while 𝑏 changes sign:\r
(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ↦−→ (𝑎, −𝑏, 𝑐).\r
Thus 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝐺(𝑎, −𝑏, 𝑐), i.e., 𝐺 is an even function of 𝑏.\r
Similarly, consider (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ↦→ (𝑣1, −𝑣2). This is again an orthogonal transformation on 𝑆, and since the\r
corresponding left multiplication matrices are related by similarity, we have\r
Δ(𝑣1, −𝑣2) = Δ(𝑣1, 𝑣2).\r
Under this operation, 𝑎 and 𝑏 are invariant and 𝑐 ↦→ −𝑐, so 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, −𝑐), i.e., 𝐺 is an even\r
function of 𝑐.\r

Proof. We use the notation 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ 𝑆 = O ⊕ O. Recall from Corollary 3.7 that a nonzero element\r
𝑣 ∈ 𝑆 is a left zero divisor if and only if\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ and ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0. (2)\r
In particular, for a zero divisor we have ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 = ∥𝑣2 ∥2 > 0, so both 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 are nonzero.\r
Let 𝑍 ⊂ 𝑆 \\ {0} be the set of nontrivial left zero divisors. We first construct an explicit bijection\r
Φ : (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) −→ 𝑍.\r
Step 1: Definition of the map. For (𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) ∈ (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), define\r
Φ(𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) := (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) ∈ 𝑆.\r
Here we identify O with R\r
8\r
in the usual way. Since (𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
), we have ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑢2 ∥ = 1 and\r
⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ = 0. Therefore\r
∥𝑟𝑢1 ∥ = 𝑟, ∥𝑟𝑢2 ∥ = 𝑟, ⟨𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2⟩ = 𝑟\r
2\r
⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ = 0.\r
By the characterization (2), Φ(𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)) is a (nontrivial) left zero divisor. Thus Φ indeed maps into 𝑍.\r
Step 2: Surjectivity. Let 𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) ∈ 𝑍 be an arbitrary nontrivial left zero divisor. Then by (2) we have\r
∥𝑣1 ∥ = ∥𝑣2 ∥ =: 𝑟 > 0, ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0.\r
Define\r
𝑢1 :=\r
𝑣1\r
𝑟\r
, 𝑢2 :=\r
𝑣2\r
𝑟\r
.\r
Then ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑢2 ∥ = 1 and ⟨𝑢1, 𝑢2⟩ =\r
1\r
𝑟\r
2\r
⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩ = 0, so (𝑢1, 𝑢2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
). Clearly\r
𝑣 = (𝑣1, 𝑣2) = (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) = Φ𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Thus Φ is surjective.\r
Step 3: Injectivity. Suppose\r
Φ\r
\r
𝑟, (𝑢1, 𝑢2)\r
\u0001\r
= Φ𝑠, (𝑤1, 𝑤2)\r
\u0001\r
,\r
i.e. (𝑟𝑢1, 𝑟𝑢2) = (𝑠𝑤1, 𝑠𝑤2) for some 𝑟, 𝑠 ∈ (0, ∞) and (𝑢1, 𝑢2), (𝑤1, 𝑤2) ∈ 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
). Then\r
𝑟𝑢1 = 𝑠𝑤1, 𝑟𝑢2 = 𝑠𝑤2.\r
Taking norms and using ∥𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑤1 ∥ = 1, we obtain\r
𝑟 = ∥𝑟𝑢1 ∥ = ∥𝑠𝑤1 ∥ = 𝑠.\r
Hence 𝑟 = 𝑠, and it follows that 𝑢1 = 𝑤1 and 𝑢2 = 𝑤2. Thus (𝑢1, 𝑢2) = (𝑤1, 𝑤2) and Φ is injective.\r

Φ is a diffeomorphism between (0, ∞) × 𝑉2 (R\r

via the above two-step rule simply applies the ambient update and then orthogonally projects back to\r
𝑇𝑣1 (𝑡+Δ𝑡) 𝑆\r
7 before renormalizing, so it acts as a discrete approximation of parallel transport on 𝐸.\r
Geometrically, this procedure can be interpreted as follows: when 𝑣1 rotates slightly, 𝑣2 is rotated as\r
little as possible so that it remains of unit length and orthogonal to the new 𝑣1.\r
Lemma 6.2 (Preservation of orthonormality). If (𝑣1 (𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡)) ∈ 𝐸 is updated to (𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡))\r
according to Definition 6.1, then (𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)) ∈ 𝐸 holds; that is,\r
∥𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) ∥ = ∥𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡) ∥ = 1, ⟨𝑣1 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡), 𝑣2 (𝑡 + Δ𝑡)⟩ = 0\r

𝑣¤2 ⊥ 𝑣1, ⟨ ¤𝑣2, 𝑣2⟩ = 0,\r
and the Levi–Civita connection again chooses 𝑣¤2 so that the frame evolves with minimal rotation.\r
In Definition 6.1, 𝑣1 is updated along a curve on 𝑆\r

the chosen initial frame has 𝑣2 (0) projecting nontrivially to the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane, and the projection remained\r
nonzero throughout the simulation, so the fiber angle was well-defined along the sampled loop.\r
In the numerical experiment, we choose 𝑣1 (𝑡) to be the great circle in the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane,\r
𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡, sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0), 𝑡 ∈ [0, 2𝜋].\r
We take Δ𝑡 sufficiently small, update 𝑣2 (𝑡𝑘) according to Definition 6.1, and compute (𝜃(𝑡𝑘), 𝜙(𝑡𝑘)) at each\r
step.\r
Plotting the point sequence (𝜃(𝑡𝑘), 𝜙(𝑡𝑘)) in the unit square [0, 2𝜋) × [0, 2𝜋) while identifying opposite\r
edges as a torus, we obtain a nearly diagonal closed curve shown in Figure 3. This suggests that when the\r
base loop winds once, the fiber angle also winds approximately once, indicating a (1, 1)–type holonomy.\r

essentially (1, 1)–type closed curve, winding once in each direction as the base loop closes. (Numerical\r
parameters: num steps = 400, seed=42.)\r
15

To evaluate the holonomy more quantitatively, we define an unwrapped fiber angle 𝜙˜(𝑡) by removing 2𝜋\r
jumps from 𝜙(𝑡), and plot it as a function of 𝜃(𝑡). Figure 4 shows this plot, with 𝜃 on the horizontal axis\r
and 𝜙˜ on the vertical axis. A least–squares linear fit yields\r
𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const.,\r
indicating a linear relation with slope close to 1.\r
Observation 6.5 (Numerical holonomy for the great circle). For the base loop 𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡,sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0)\r
and the discrete parallel transport scheme in Definition 6.1, the numerically observed holonomy transfor\u0002mation exhibits the following qualitative behaviour:\r
(i) it acts as a nontrivial rotation on the oriented two–plane spanned by the zero–divisor frame (𝑣1, 𝑣2);\r
(ii) it is close to the identity on the orthogonal complement of this two–plane.\r
In other words, the holonomy is typically of (1, 1)–type with respect to the decompositionR\r
8 = span{𝑣1, 𝑣2}⊕\r
span{𝑣1, 𝑣2}\r
⊥, and the unwrapped slope 𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const. provides numerical evidence for this behaviour.\r
Remark 6.6. We emphasize that Observation 6.5 is based solely on numerical experiments using a simple\r
Euler integrator for the Levi–Civita connection. At present we do not claim a rigorous theorem asserting\r
that the holonomy is exactly of (1, 1)–type for the true Levi–Civita connection on the sedenionic zero–divisor\r
frame manifold; we regard these computations as evidence for such behaviour and as motivation for future\r
analytic work.\r
Lemma 6.7 (Toy model for (1, 1)–type holonomy). Consider the flat product manifold 𝑀 := (𝑆\r
1 ×𝑆1\r
) ×R\r
𝑘\r
with the standard product metric, and let 𝐸 → 𝑀 be the trivial rank–𝑛 bundle with the Levi–Civita\r
connection induced from the ambient Euclidean space R\r
𝑛\r
. Fix an orthogonal decomposition R\r
𝑛 = 𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈⊥\r
with dim𝑈 = 2, and suppose that along 𝑀 the subbundle 𝑈 is tangent to the 𝑆\r
1 × 𝑆1–directions while 𝑈⊥\r
is constant.\r
Then the holonomy of the Levi–Civita connection along any fundamental loop of 𝑆\r
1 × 𝑆1\r
is a rotation\r
in 𝑈 and the identity on 𝑈\r
⊥. In particular, the holonomy is of (1, 1)–type with respect to the decomposition\r
𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈\r
⊥.\r
Proof sketch. Since the metric on 𝑀 is flat and of product type, the Levi–Civita connection on 𝑇 𝑀 is trivial\r
in the R\r
𝑘–directions and reduces to the standard flat connection on each 𝑆1\r
factor. The bundle 𝐸 is trivial\r
with the constant splitting 𝐸 = 𝑈 ⊕ 𝑈\r
⊥, and by assumption the connection preserves both subbundles.\r
Along a fundamental loop in one 𝑆\r
1–direction, the parallel transport in 𝑈⊥ is therefore the identity, while\r
in 𝑈 it is given by a rotation of some angle (completely determined by the chosen frame along 𝑆\r
1\r
). Since\r
the two 𝑆\r
1–directions commute and the connection is flat, the holonomy along any (𝑚, 𝑛)–cycle in 𝑆1 × 𝑆1\r
is again a pure rotation in 𝑈 and the identity on 𝑈\r
⊥. □\r
Remark 6.8. Lemma 6.7 should be viewed only as a simplified caricature of the situation on the genuine\r
zero–divisor frame manifold, where the metric is curved and the splitting into the zero–divisor plane and its\r
orthogonal complement is not globally parallel. However, our numerical experiments suggest that, at least\r
along the torus–type loops considered in this section, the qualitative (1, 1)–type behaviour of the holonomy\r
persists. We regard this as evidence that the zero–divisor frame manifold inherits a geometric structure\r
reminiscent of the toy model above.\r
In the numerical experiments underlying Observation 6.5, we choose a generic initial frame (𝑣1 (0), 𝑣2 (0)) ∈\r
𝐸 with 𝑣2 (0) having a nonzero projection to the base 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane. We vary the time discretization param\u0002eter Δ𝑡 = 2𝜋/num steps with num steps ∈ {100, 200, 400, 800} and find that the least–squares slope 𝑘 in\r
𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝑘𝜃 + const. remains stably close to 1 (typically 𝑘 = 1.00 ± 10−3). This indicates that the observed\r
(1, 1)–type holonomy is not an artifact of a particular discretization or initial condition.\r
The curvature tensor of the induced Levi–Civita connection on the Stiefel manifold 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) is homoge\u0002neous under the 𝑆𝑂(8)–action. The observed (1, 1)–type holonomy can be regarded as a concrete example\r
of an area–proportional phase caused by this curvature, analogous to the Berry phase in physics (cf. do\r
Carmo [12]). In this paper we confine ourselves to this qualitative discussion; a more detailed computation\r
of the curvature and its representation–theoretic description are left as future work.\r

scalar rescaling. An important future problem is to clarify, via the structure of 𝐺2–orbits and normal forms,\r
to what extent this quadratic cone model appears universally for general zero divisors.\r
We have also introduced a discrete Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold\r
𝐸 \u001B 𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) and visualized its holonomy as curves on a torus. The observation that the holonomy of the\r
base great circle loop forms a (1, 1)–type closed curve suggests that the zero–divisor frame bundle has a\r
geometric structure that twists once per loop. The discretization adopted here can be seen as a numerical\r
approximation of a natural 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariant connection, but since the sedenion multiplication is closely\r
related to the action of the exceptional group 𝐺2, it is expected that comparing the holonomy with the\r
standard representation of 𝑆𝑂(8) and its restriction to 𝐺2 will yield a more algebraic understanding. In\r
this paper we do not go into these details and focus instead on visualization and observation, but a more\r
systematic analysis of the curvature tensor and representation–theoretic structure is an important direction\r
for future work.\r
From a symmetry viewpoint, the observed (1, 1)–type holonomy is also natural. The Stiefel manifold\r
𝑉2 (R\r
8\r
) can be regarded as the homogeneous space 𝑆𝑂(8)/𝑆𝑂(6) equipped with the 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariant\r
Riemannian metric, and the Levi–Civita connection is uniquely determined by this symmetry. Our base\r
17

loop 𝑣1 (𝑡) = (cos𝑡,sin 𝑡, 0, . . . , 0) arises from the action of a one-parameter subgroup 𝑆𝑂(2) ⊂ 𝑆𝑂(8)\r
rotating the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane. In such a highly symmetric situation, there is essentially a unique natural scale\r
for the holonomy along one full rotation, and the simplest nontrivial possibility is that the frame twists\r
once when the base vector rotates once. The numerically observed slope 𝜙˜(𝜃) ≈ 𝜃 + const. can therefore\r
be interpreted as a manifestation of this 𝑆𝑂(8)–invariance, analogous to how the holonomy on a sphere is\r
determined solely by the enclosed area of a loop.\r
A natural next step would be to substantiate the observed (1, 1)–type holonomy by a more systematic\r
numerical study. One can investigate the convergence of the slope in Observation 6.5 as the step size\r
Δ𝑡 → 0, the dependence on the initial frame and the great circle choice, and the behavior under global\r
𝑆𝑂(8)–rotations of the entire configuration. Moreover, by deforming the base loop within the 𝑒0–𝑒1 plane\r
(e.g. to ellipses) and comparing the resulting holonomy with the enclosed area, it should be possible to\r
test an area law analogous to the Berry phase on spheres. Similar phenomena have been studied in sub\u0002Riemannian visualizations such as Montgomery [13] and Bullo–Lewis [14]. We leave a detailed numerical\r
and theoretical analysis of these questions to future work."""

In this paper, we have visualized and analyzed the geometric structure of the sedenion zero–divisor set along\r
the following three main lines:\r
• We constructed fundamental factors 𝐷1, 𝐷2 such that the determinant of the left multiplication matrix\r
satisfies\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
,\r
and showed that nonzero zero divisors are characterized by the condition 𝐷2 (𝑣) = 0.\r
• We analyzed 𝐷2 on the cyclic permutation slice and derived the local model\r
𝐷2 (𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍) = 4(𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋)\r
2\r
,\r
confirming via 2D/3D visualization that the local singular structure is given by the quadratic cone\r
𝑋𝑌 + 𝑌 𝑍 + 𝑍 𝑋 = 0.\r
• We introduced a discrete Levi–Civita connection on the normalized zero–divisor manifold and visu\u0002alized its holonomy as curves on a torus, thereby observing geometric twisting in the zero–divisor\r
frame bundle.\r
These results constitute a basic attempt to understand the zero–divisor geometry of an abstract nondivi\u0002sion algebra via explicit polynomials and computer graphics. Future directions include extending the analysis\r
to more general slices and higher Cayley–Dickson algebras, comparing different natural 𝐺2–invariant con\u0002nections, and elucidating the relations between curvature and topology. In particular, investigating the\r
homotopy classification of zero–divisor frame bundles based on the action of 𝐺2 and analyzing the curva\u0002ture structure of natural connections appear to be key steps toward embedding the visualizations obtained\r
here into a more algebraic framework.\r
A Outline of the coefficient determination in Theorem 3.6\r
In this appendix we briefly summarize the procedure for determining the coefficients in the proof of\r
Theorem 3.6.\r
For 𝑣 = 𝑣1 + 𝑣2𝑒8, define\r
𝑎 = ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, 𝑏 = ∥𝑣1 ∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣2 ∥2\r
, 𝑐 = ⟨𝑣1, 𝑣2⟩.\r
As discussed in §3, Δ(𝑣) can be written as\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐),\r
where\r
𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝛼𝑎4 + 𝛽𝑎2𝑏\r
2 + 𝛾𝑎2\r
𝑐\r
2 + 𝛿𝑏4 + 𝜀𝑏2\r
𝑐\r
2 + 𝜁𝑐4\r

is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 8 with unknown coefficients 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾, 𝛿, 𝜀, 𝜁 ∈ R.\r
Using the standard basis 𝑒0, . . . , 𝑒7 of O, we choose six pairs (𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
1\r
, 𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
2\r
) ∈ O × O as follows:\r
(1) 𝑣\r
(1)\r
1\r
= 𝑒0, 𝑣\r
(1)\r
2\r
= 0,\r
(2) 𝑣\r
(2)\r
1\r
= 2𝑒0, 𝑣\r
(2)\r
2\r
= 0,\r
(3) 𝑣\r
(3)\r
1\r
= 𝑒0, 𝑣\r
(3)\r
2\r
= 𝑒1,\r
(4) 𝑣\r
(4)\r
1\r
= 𝑒0, 𝑣\r
(4)\r
2\r
= 2𝑒1,\r
(5) 𝑣\r
(5)\r
1\r
= 𝑒0 + 𝑒1, 𝑣\r
(5)\r
2\r
= 𝑒0 − 𝑒1,\r
(6) 𝑣\r
(6)\r
1\r
= 𝑒0 + 𝑒1, 𝑣\r
(6)\r
2\r
= 2𝑒0.\r
For each 𝑘 = 1, . . . , 6, we compute\r
𝑎\r
(𝑘) = ∥𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
1\r
∥\r
2 + ∥𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
2\r
∥\r
2\r
, 𝑏(𝑘) = ∥𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
1\r
∥\r
2 − ∥𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
2\r
∥\r
2\r
, 𝑐(𝑘) = ⟨𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
1\r
, 𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
2\r
⟩,\r
and the determinant\r
Δ\r
(𝑘)\r
:= det 𝑀\r
\r
𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
\u0001\r
of the left multiplication matrix 𝑀(𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
).\r
Substituting these into\r
𝐺\r
\r
𝑎\r
(𝑘)\r
, 𝑏(𝑘), 𝑐(𝑘)\r
\u0001\r
= Δ(𝑘), 𝑘 = 1, . . . , 6,\r
yields a 6 × 6 linear system\r

where the entries of 𝐴 are polynomials in 𝑎\r
(𝑘)\r
, 𝑏(𝑘), 𝑐(𝑘).\r
In practice, we use Python/SymPy to compute both the determinants of 𝑀(𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
) and the entries of 𝐴\r
as rational polynomials, verify that 𝐴 is invertible, and find the unique solution. The accompanying script\r
constructs 𝑀(𝑣) from Lemma 3.4, substitutes the six test pairs (𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
1\r
, 𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
2\r
), evaluates each det 𝑀(𝑣\r
(𝑘)\r
),\r
assembles the matrix 𝐴 of monomials in (𝑎\r
(𝑘)\r
, 𝑏(𝑘), 𝑐(𝑘)), and solves the 6 × 6 linear system symbolically.\r
We use a similar approach to determine the coefficient matrix and verify that the linear system has a unique\r
solution even for other choices of representative elements. The coefficient matrix 𝐴 is invertible, and the\r
unique solution is given by\r
𝛼 = 1, 𝛽 = 0, 𝛾 = 4, 𝛿 = 0, 𝜀 = 0, 𝜁 = 0.\r
Thus\r
𝐺(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) = 𝑎\r
4\r
(𝑏\r
2 + 4𝑐2\r
)\r
2\r
,\r
and we obtain the factorization\r
Δ(𝑣) = 𝐷1 (𝑣)\r
4𝐷2 (𝑣)2\r
claimed in Theorem 3.6.\r
