We show how to build a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) representa\u0002tion of the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian H by applying the recently proposed tensor\r
network renormalization (TNR) [G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, arXiv:1412.0732] to the Euclidean time\r
evolution operator e\r
−βH for infinite β. This approach bypasses the costly energy minimization of\r
previous MERA algorithms and, when applied to finite inverse temperature β, produces a MERA\r
representation of a thermal Gibbs state. Our construction endows TNR with a renormalization\r
group flow in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians (and not merely in the more abstract\r
space of tensors) and extends the MERA formalism to classical statistical systems.\r

Consider a strongly interacting quantum many-body\r
system in D spatial dimensions described by a micro\u0002scopic Hamiltonian H. Understanding its collective, low\r
energy behavior is a main goal in condensed matter and\r
high energy physics, one that poses a formidable theoret\u0002ical challenge. To tackle this problem, plenty of methods\r
have been proposed based on the renormalization group\r
(RG) [1–3], that is, on studying how the physics depends\r
on the scale of observation. Weakly interacting systems\r
can be addressed perturbatively using momentum space\r
RG [2]. Instead, strongly interacting systems often re\u0002quire non-perturbative, real space RG methods, as pio\u0002neered by Kadanoff [1] and Wilson [2].\r
Improving on Kadanoff and Wilson’s proposals,\r
White’s density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\r
for quantum spin chains [4] established how to systemati\u0002cally preserve the ground state wave-function during real\u0002space coarse-graining – namely, by preserving the sup\u0002port of its reduced density matrix. Similarly, Levin and\r
Nave’s tensor renormalization group (TRG) [5] taught\r
us how to coarse-grain Euclidean path integrals of one\u0002dimensional quantum systems (also partition functions\r
of two-dimensional classical systems). Both DMRG and\r
TRG are very successful, versatile approaches. However,\r
they depart significantly from the spirit of the RG, in\r
that they produce a coarse-grained, effective description\r
of the system that still retains some irrelevant micro\u0002scopic details. As a result, these methods (i) fail to define\r
a proper RG flow, one with e.g. the correct structure of\r
fixed points; and (ii) struggle to deal with critical systems\r
or systems in D ≥ 2 dimensions, where the accumulation\r
of irrelevant microscopic degrees of freedom is more sig\u0002nificant and harmful.\r
These difficulties have been solved with two closely re\u0002lated proposals. First, entanglement renormalization was\r
put forward to address the above two problems in the\r
context of ground state wave-functions [6, 7]. By intro\u0002ducing disentanglers, which remove short-range entangle\u0002ment, a proper RG flow is generated, as well as an RG\r
transformation that is computationally sustainable even\r
at criticality. In addition, entanglement renormalization\r
leads to an efficient tensor network description of ground\r
states for critical systems, the multi-scale entanglement\r
renormalization ansatz (MERA) [7], of interest not only\r
as a many-body variational state [7–14] but also as a lat\u0002tice realization of the holographic principle [15, 16].\r
Tensor network renormalization (TNR), on the other\r
hand, was more recently proposed to tackle the same\r
problems in the context of Euclidean path integrals (and\r
classical statistical systems) [17]. The Euclidean path\r
integral Z ≡ tr e\r
−βH\u0001\r
is represented by a tensor net\u0002work, consisting of copies of a single tensor A [18], which\r
extends both in space and Euclidean time directions.\r
Through local manipulation of this tensor network, TNR\r
produces a sequence of tensors,\r
A → A\r
′ → A′′ → · · · → Afp, (1)\r
corresponding to increasing length scales, which flow to\u0002wards some infrared fixed-point tensor Afp. The later\r
retains only the universal features of the phase or phase\r
transition [17]. Once again, the key of the approach is\r
the removal of short-range correlations by disentanglers.\r
In this Letter we establish a close connection between\r
the two approaches. We show that, when applied to the\r
Euclidean path integral restricted to the upper half plane,\r
TNR generates a MERA for the ground state of Hamilto\u0002nian H. More generally, TNR also produces a MERA for\r
the thermal Gibbs state ρβ ≡ e\r
−βH/Z at finite inverse\r
temperature β, as well as for the low energy eigenstates\r
of H on a finite periodic chain. Our result provides an\r
alternative route to the MERA, one that bypasses the\r
costly energy minimization of previous algorithms [8, 9]\r
and has several other significant advantages, both con\u0002ceptual and computational, that we also discuss. Among\r
those, we emphasize that (i) we obtain the first correct\r
MERA representation of the thermal state ρβ [19], to-

2\r
gether with an algorithm to find it; (ii) the connection\r
implies that TNR produces an RG flow in the space of\r
wave-functions and Hamiltonians, and not just in the ab\u0002stract space of tensors, Eq. 1; (iii) the MERA formalism\r
can be applied now also to classical statistical systems.\r
For simplicity, we consider a translation invariant system\r
in D = 1 dimensions, although the key results generalize\r
to inhomogeneous systems in dimension D ≥ 1.\r
Tensor network for Euclidean time evolution.— Given\r
a translation invariant Hamiltonian H in one dimen\u0002sion, we use a standard procedure [20] to produce a\r
two-dimensional tensor network representation of the Eu\u0002clidean time operator e\r
−βH or Euclidean path integral\r
tr e\r
−βH\u0001\r
. This tensor network is made of copies of a\r
single tensor A. If both the system size L and the in\u0002verse temperature β are infinite, then the network spans\r
the entire (x, τ)-plane, where x and τ label space and Eu\u0002clidean time, respectively. Here we will consider tensor\r
networks for e\r
−βH on three different geometries, obtained\r
by introducing a horizontal cut at τ = 0 and by choosing\r
L and β to be either finite or infinite [21].\r
TNR yields MERA.— Let us start with the upper half\r
plane, Fig. 1, which corresponds to the ground state |Ψi\r
of H on an infinite lattice. The network has an open\r
boundary at τ = 0, with an infinite row of open indices,\r
one for each site of the one-dimensional lattice on which\r
H acts. We first apply TNR everywhere on the upper half\r
plane except near τ = 0, where we keep the open indices\r
of the tensor network untouched. TNR acts through an\r
intrincate sequence of local replacements [17]. Here we\r
skip the technical details [22] and focus instead on de\u0002scribing the final result: a coarse-grained tensor network\r
with effective tensor A′for most of the upper half plane,\r
in accordance with Eq. 1, together with a double row\r
of special tensors, so-called disentanglers and isometries,\r
which correspond to one layer of the MERA [23]. These\r
tensors connect the microscopic degrees of freedom at\r
length scale s = 0 (represented by the original open in\u0002dices of the network) with the coarse-grained degrees of\r
freedom at length scale s = 1 (represented by the lower\r
indices of the lowest row of tensors A′). We can now re\u0002peat the process on tensors A′\r
, to obtain coarse-grained\r
tensors A′′ and a second row of disentanglers and isome\u0002tries, i.e. a second layer of the MERA, connecting scales\r
s = 1 and 2. Iteration then produces a full MERA ap\u0002proximation for the ground state |Ψi of H, encompassing\r
all length scales s = 0, 1, 2, · · · .\r
Thermal MERA.— Let us now consider a horizontal\r
strip of finite width β, Fig. 2(a), which is proportional\r
to the thermal state ρβ ≡ e\r
−βH/Z. This time we have\r
two boundaries, each with an infinite row of open in\u0002dices: the incoming and outgoing indices of the Euclidean\r
time evolution operator e\r
−βH. As before, we use TNR\r
to coarse-grain the tensor network, except near its open\r
boundaries, where we do not touch the open indices. Fig.\r
2(b) shows the net result: a coarse-grained tensor net\u0002FIG. 1. (a) Tensor network the ground state |Ψi of H on an\r
infinite lattice. It is made of copies of tensor A and restricted\r
to the upper half plane (x, τ +), with a row of open indices\r
at τ = 0. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor network while\r
leaving the open indices untouched, we obtain a new tensor\r
network with tensors A\r
′\r
together with one row of disenta\u0002glers and isometries. (c) Further coarse-graining of the tensor\r
network produces new coarse-grained tensors A\r
′′ and a sec\u0002ond layer of disentanglers and isometries. (d) By iteration we\r
obtain a full MERA approximation for state |Ψi.\r
work, with effective tensor A′, together with a double\r
row of disentanglers and isometries both for the incoming\r
and outgoing indices. After O(log2(β)) iterations of the\r
coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a MERA represen\u0002tation of the thermal state, Fig. 2(c) made of O(log2\r
(β))\r
double layers of disentanglers and isometries for both the\r
incoming and outgoing indices, together with a central\r
row of tensors. Disentanglers and isometries are isomet\u0002ric tensors and thus do not affect the spectrum of eigen\u0002values of the thermal MERA, which therefore depends\r
exclusively on the central row of tensors [24].\r
The thermal MERA obtained from TNR resembles the\r
form first suggested by Swingle in the context of holog\u0002raphy [15], where a 1+1 conformal field theory is dual\r
to a gravity theory in 3 space-time dimensions. In this\r
context, the thermal MERA is interpreted as describing a\r
space-like cross-section of a black hole space-time geome\u0002try. A significant difference in our construction is the cen\u0002tral row of tensors, which is absent in Swingle’s proposal\r
[15] and provides ρβ with the correct thermal spectrum\r
of eigenvalues {e\r
−βEi /Z}, where {Ei} are the eigenval\u0002ues of H. This central row of tensors can be thought of\r
as representing the Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the\r
two asymptotic AdS regions [25], which seems to provide\r
a manifestation of the ER=EPR conjecture [26].\r
Periodic chain of size L.— In our third construction,\r
we use TNR to coarse-grain a tensor network for the\r
ground state of Hamiltonian H on a periodic chain of size\r
L, see Fig. 3(a). The network consists of a semi-infinite,

3\r
FIG. 2. (a) Tensor network on an infinite strip of finite\r
width β, with two rows of open indices. It is proportional to\r
the thermal state e\r
−βH/Z. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor\r
network while leaving the open indices untouched, we obtain\r
a new tensor network with tensors A\r
′\r
together with an up\u0002per and lower row of disentaglers and isometries. (c) Futher\r
coarse-graining produces a thermal MERA.\r
vertical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices.\r
After about O(log2(L)) coarse-graining steps the size of\r
the system has effectively become O(1), see Fig. 3(c), and\r
we have O(log2(L)) layers of the MERA connected to a\r
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite\r
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a\r
transfer matrix T . The dominant eigenvector of T leads\r
to the ground state of H, whereas subdominant eigen\u0002vectors describe low energy eigenstates.\r
To illustrate the computational possibilities offered\r
by the new algorithm, we consider the one-dimensional\r
quantum Ising model with transverse magnetic field both\r
at finite β for an infinite chain, and at zero temperature\r
for a finite periodic chain of length L [27]. The calcu\u0002lation required less than 5 minutes on a 2.5Ghz dual\r
core laptop with 4Gb of memory (MERA bond dimension\r
χ = 10). First, for L = ∞, Fig. 4(a) shows the expecta\u0002tion value of the energy density Ethermal ≡ tr(ρβH)/L as\r
a function of the inverse temperature β, while Fig. 4(b)\r
displays, at critical magnetic field, the crossover between\r
polynomial decay of correlations at short distances (due\r
to quantum fluctuations at criticality) and their exponen\u0002tial decay at longer distances (due to finite temperature\r
statistical fluctuations). Then, for β = ∞, Figs. 4(c)-\r
(d) show, respectively, the low energy spectra of H as a\r
function of the inverse system size 1/L, and the energy\r
and momentum of low energy states for L = 1024. In all\r
cases, an accurate approximation to the exact result is\r
obtained.\r
Discussion.— Since its proposal a decade ago [7], the\r
FIG. 3. (a) Tensor network on a semi-infinite vertical cylin\u0002der of finite width L and with a row of open indices, propor\u0002tional to the ground state of H on a periodic chain made of L\r
sites. (b) Result of coarse-graining the initial tensor network\r
while not touching its open indices. (c) MERA connected to\r
a semi-infinite vertical cylinder of O(1) width. Inset: transfer\r
matrix T of this cylinder. The eigenvectors of T with largest\r
eigenvalues correspond to the low energy eigenstates of H. (d)\r
MERA for the ground state/low energy excited states of H,\r
where the top tensor is an eigenvector of the transfer matrix\r
T .\r
MERA has been regarded as a variational class of states.\r
Accordingly, one attempts to approximate the ground\r
state |Ψi of H by optimizing the variational parame\u0002ters contained in the disentanglers and isometries of the\r
MERA, for instance by iteratively minimizing the ex\u0002pectation value of H [8, 9]. Such energy optimization is\r
costly (it may require thousands of sweeps over scale) and\r
prone to becoming trapped in local minima. Moreover,\r
there is no guarantee that the end result is an approx\u0002imation to the ground state |Ψi – one just has a wave\u0002function with, hopefully, reasonably low energy. Here\r
we have argued that, instead, an approximate MERA\r
representation of the ground state |Ψi can be obtained\r
with TNR by coarse-graining an initial, quasi-exact ten\u0002sor network representation of |Ψi [29]. This only requires\r
one sweep over scale, and it is therefore computationally\r
much more efficient [30]. In addition, at each coarse\u0002graining step TNR introduces a truncation error [17] that\r
can be explicitly computed. If this truncation error is\r
sufficiently small, then one can certify that the resulting\r
MERA approximates the true ground state |Ψi within\r
that small error [31].\r
Importantly, TNR acts locally: the coarse-graining of\r
the tensor network at point (x, τ) only depends on the\r
tensors in an immediate neighborhood [17]. Let us men\u0002tion three consequences for the resulting MERA. (i) Since

state energy) as a function of the inverse temperature β, for\r
the quantum Ising model H =\r

infinite chain, for different values of magnetic field λ. Con\u0002tinuous lines correspond to the exact solution. (b) Connected\r
two-point correlators at the critical magnetic field λ = 1, as a\r
function of the distance d, for several values of β. Continuous\r
lines correspond again to the exact solution. (c) Low energy\r
eigenvalues of H for critical λ = 1 as a function of 1/L. (d)\r
Low energy spectrum of H for critical λ = 1 and correspond\u0002ing momentum (in unites of 2π/L) for L = 1024 sites, which\r
appear organized according to the conformal towers of the\r
identity I (red), spin σ (green), and energy density ǫ (blue)\r
primary fields of the Ising CFT, [28]. Discontinuous lines\r
in (c) and (d) correspond to the finite-size CFT prediction,\r
which ignores corrections of order L\r
−2\r
.\r
TNR is not aware of the system size L or inverse temper\u0002ature β, it produces the same tensors A, A′\r
, A′′, · · · and\r
disentanglers and isometries for the ground state |Ψi in\r
the thermodynamic limit (L = β = ∞) as it does for the\r
states ρβ and |Ψ(L)i at finite β or L. Thus, a single TNR\r
calculation produces an accurate MERA approximation\r
for all these states. (ii) In the absence of translation in\u0002variance, where a different tensor Ai may be required for\r
each site i of the lattice, the coarse-graining of different\r
parts of the system can be conducted in parallel, leading\r
to a massive reduction in computational time. (iii) At a\r
conceptual level, locality of TNR implies the validity of\r
the theory of minimal updates [33]. This theory, which\r
asserts that only certain parts of the MERA need to be\r
changed in order to account for a localized change in the\r
Hamiltonian H [33], is particularly useful in the study of\r
systems with boundaries, defects, or interfaces [9, 14].\r
In Summary, in this Letter we have shown that, when\r
applied to the Euclidean path integral restricted to sev\u0002eral geometries, TNR [17] produces a MERA for the\r
ground state and thermal states of a quantum Hamil\u0002tonian, and have explored a number of consequences of\r
this result. We conclude by briefly mentioning two more\r
implications. First, thanks to this connection, TNR in\u0002herits from the MERA its ability to define an RG flow\r
in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians [6–8].\r
Notice that extracting the emergent physics from these\r
RG flows should be easier (both conceptually and com\u0002putationally) than extracting it from the RG flow in the\r
more abstract space of tensors, Eq. 1. Second, although\r
we have focused on quantum systems, TNR can also be\r
applied to statistical partition functions [17]. Therefore\r
the present construction extends the MERA formalism\r
(including strategies to extract universal critical proper\u0002ties [10–14]) to classical statistical systems.\r

[18] We assume translation invariance. For a system that is\r
not invariant under translations, a different tensor Ai\r
may be needed for each site i of the lattice.\r
[19] Previous proposals for a thermal MERA discussed in\r
Refs. [15] in the context of holography have a flat spec\u0002trum of eigenvalues and therefore do not reproduce the\r
correct, finite temperature spectrum of ρβ.\r

[23] On the plane, the double row of disentanglers and isome\u0002tries will annihilate with a double row of conjugate disen\u0002tanglers and isometries corresponding to τ < 0. Instead,\r
on the half upper plane, these tensors remain.\r
[24] The normalization factor Z corresponds to the trace of\r
the thermal MERA. Since the conjugate layers of disen\u0002tanglers and isometries do not change this trace, Z is also\r
the trace of the central row of tensors A\r
max, or an infinite\r
power of some (transfer) matrix M obtained from tensor\r
A\r
max by contracting its vertical indices. A normalized\r
thermal MERA is then obtained by replacing A\r
max with\r
A\r
max/λ, where λ is the dominant eigenvalue of M.\r

[27] The numerical results for finite/infinite values of β and\r
L were all actually extracted from a single calculation,\r
where TNR was applied to an infinite system at zero\r
temperature (β = L = ∞).\r
[28] See e.g. Chapter 10 of M. Henkel, Conformal invariance\r
and critical phenomena, Springer-Verlag (1999).\r
[29] The initial tensor network representation of |Ψi is quasi\u0002exact, in that the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition used to\r
produce it (Appendices A and B) introduces only small\r
errors, which can be systematically reduced.\r
[30] For details, see Appendix D.\r
[31] We emphasize, however, that TNR is not committed to\r
exclusively producing a MERA. For instance, if at some\r
scale s the ground state approximately decomposes as\r
the product of two ground states, then the corresponding\r
tensor A\r
(s) will approximately factorize as A\r
(s)\r
1 ⊗ A\r
(s)\r
2\r
,\r
and TNR will give rise instead to a branching MERA\r
[32], which was proposed to describe e.g. highly entangled\r
phases of matter in D ≥ 2 dimensions.\r

Appendix A.– A tensor network for the Euclidean\r
path integral\r
In this section we describe how to obtain a conve\u0002nient, quasi-exact tensor network representation of the\r
partition function/Euclidean time path integral Z ≡\r
tr E−βH\u0001(or Euclidean time evolution operator e\r
−βH),\r
starting from the short-ranged Hamiltonian H of a 1D\r
quantum system on the lattice. This tensor network is\r
used in the main text as the starting point to obtain\r
MERA representations for the ground state and thermal\r
states of H in infinite and finite systems, see also Ap\u0002pendix B. It is also used in Appendix C.\r
For simplicity, we assume that H is a sum of nearest\r
neighbor terms only,\r
H =\r
X\r
i\r
hi,i+1 (2)\r
[Longer- (but finite-) range terms can be treated with a\r
slightly more complicated scheme.] The first step is to\r
split H into two contributions, H = Heven + Hodd\r
Heven ≡\r
X\r
even i\r
hi,i+1, Hodd ≡\r
X\r
odd i\r
hi,i+1, (3)\r
and use a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [34] to approx\u0002imately express e\r
βH as the P-fold product of operators\r
e\r
ǫHeven and eǫHodd ,\r
e\r
βH ≈\r
\r
e\r
−ǫHeven e\r
−ǫHodd \u0001P\r
, ǫ ≡ β/P ≪ 1. (4)\r
This introduces an error of order O(βǫ), which therefore\r
vanishes in the limit of small ǫ/large P. [One can ob\u0002tain an error O(β(ǫ)\r
n), n > 1, by using a higher order\r
Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [35]]. Since Heven is a sum\r
of terms that act on different sites and therefore com\u0002mute, e\r
ǫHeven is simply a product of two-site gates, and\r
similarly for e\r
βHodd ,\r
e\r
−ǫHeven =\r

even i\r
e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 , e−ǫHodd =\r
Y\r

e\r
−ǫhi,i+1\r
.\r
(5)\r
Each two-site gate e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 is a tensor made of four in\u0002dices. Therefore we have obtained a tensor network rep\u0002resentation of e\r
−βH, see Fig. 5(a). Using singular value\r
decompositions (in the vertical and horizontal direction,\r
as indicated in the inset of Fig. 5) we can then transform\r
this tensor network into a new tensor network made of\r
four-legged tensors A connected according to a square\r
lattice pattern.\r
However, by construction e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 is very close to the\r
identity, e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 = I + O(ǫ), which implies that the\r
square tensor network is highly anisotropic. It is then\r
convenient to coarse-grain in the Euclidean time direc\u0002tion, until space and time direction have become qualita\u0002tively equivalent, in the sense e.g. that the ordered sin\u0002gular values of a tensor in both directions decay roughly\r
in the same way. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.\r

the form e\r

according to the inset. (c) Final tensor network for the Eu\u0002clidean path integral in terms of copies of a single tensor A.\r
FIG. 6. (a) Tensor network for the Euclidean path integral\r
produced in Fig. 5, made of copies of a single tensor A. (b)\r
We can introduce isometries (obtained e.g. from the singular\r
value decomposition of a vertical pair of tensors A) to define a\r
new tensor A˜. (c) In the new tensor network, each row of ten\u0002sors A˜ accounts for two rows of tensors A, in such a way that\r
the anisotropy between space and Euclidean time directions\r
has been reduced. The initial square tensor network discussed\r
in the main text is the result of applying this compression in\r
the Euclidean time directions a few times.

Appendix B.— Four geometries for an Euclidean\r
time evolution\r
In this section we review the well-known fact that\r
the Euclidean time evolution operator e\r
−βH(L)\r
is pro\u0002portional to the thermal state ρ\r
(L)\r
β\r
,\r

, Z(L)\r
β ≡ tr \u0010\r
e\r
−βH(L)\r
\u0011\r
, (6)\r
where L denotes the length of a periodic chain and β\r
is the inverse temperature. Here we use H(L) and H ≡\r
H(L→∞)to denote a Hamiltonian on a periodic lattice of\r
size L and on an infinite lattice, respectively.\r
We consider four geometries, obtained from combina\u0002tions of infinite and finite L and β. These geometries are\r
represented in Fig. 7. The partition function Z\r
(L)\r
β\r
corre\u0002sponds to a torus of size L and β in the horizontal and\r
vertical directions, respectively, which are parameterized\r
by space and Euclidean time coordinates (x, τ). Then\r
e\r
−βH(L)\r
corresponds to the vertical cylinder obtained by\r
cutting the torus at τ = 0, as represented in Fig. 7(d).\r
At infinite length L, this cylinder is replaced by an\r
infinite strip of finite width β, representing e\r
−βH, which\r
is proportional to the thermal state ρβ of Fig. 7(b), with\r
ρβ ≡ lim\r
L→∞\r
ρ\r
(L)\r
β\r
. (7)\r
At infinite inverse temperature β (or zero temperature)\r
we obtain a projector\r
|Ψ(L)ihΨ(L)| = lim\r
β→∞\r
e\r
−βH(L)\r
Z\r
(L)\r

, (8)\r
onto the ground state |Ψ(L)i of H(L). In other words, for\r
any state |φ0i such that hΨ(L)|φ0i 6= 0,\r
|Ψ(L)i ∝ lim\r
β→∞\r
e\r
βH(L)\r
|φ0i. (9)\r
Therefore, for finite L, the Euclidean time evolution op\u0002erator on a semi-infinite vertical cylinder is proportional\r
to the ground state |Ψ(L)i of H(L), Fig. 7(c).\r
Finally, for infinite β and L, the semi-infinite cylinder\r
above is replaced with the upper half plane and produces\r
the ground state |Ψi of H, Fig. 7(a).\r
We have therefore attached a geometry to each of the\r
ground states and thermal states |Ψi, ρβ, |Ψ(L)i, and\r
ρ\r
(L)\r
β\r
. In the main text we consider explicitly the coarse\u0002graining of the tensor network for the first three geome\u0002tries in Fig. 7, that is (a) - (c), and the fourth one [the\r
finite cylinder (d)] is left as an exercise that follows from\r
the previous cases.\r

Appendix C.— Tensor Network Renormalization,\r
step by step\r
In this section we review the detailed sequence of local\r
replacements that define the coarse-graining transforma\u0002tion of TNR. For convenience, we have introduced some\r
cosmetic changes compared to Ref. [17].\r
The actual sequence is shown in Fig. 8. It\r
involves a number of intermediate tensors (namely\r
B, u, vL, vR, x, y, w) in addition to the final coarse\u0002grained tensor A′\r
. When applied to an infinite square\r
tensor network made of copies of tensor A, Fig. 9, these\r
local replacements produce a coarse-grained tensor net\u0002work made of copies of a new tensor A′\r
, where there is a\r
copy of A′for every four initial tensors A. None of the\r
intermediate tensors appear in the coarse-grained tensor\r
network. We can think of TNR as implementing a global\r
change of scale, from (x, τ) to (x\r
′\r
, τ′) where\r
x → x\r
′ = x/2, τ → τ′ = τ /2. (10)\r
Let us now consider instead applying TNR to coarse\u0002grain the restriction of the initial square tensor network\r
on the upper half plane, as represented in Fig. 10. Recall\r
that this restriction defines a projector onto the ground\r
state of H. By applying the sequence as local replace\u0002ments of Fig. 8, we see that most of the upper half plane\r
ends up in a coarse-grained square tensor network again\r
made of tensors A′. However, near the open boundary of

8\r
the tensor network first a row of disentanglers u, and then\r
a row of isometries w, accumulate. These disentanglers\r
and isometries cannot annihilate with Hermitian conju\u0002gates u\r
† and w† because those would belong to the lower\r
half plane, which is not available.\r
As discussed in the main text and Fig.1 of the main\r
text, iteration of the coarse-graining produces a full\r
MERA for the ground state |Ψi of H. Let us now give a\r
geometrical interpretation of this construction. It turns\r
out that TNR allows to implement local scale transfor\u0002mations on the lattice [36], that is, a discrete version\r
of certain conformal transformations in the continuum.\r
From this perspective, the MERA results from (the dis\u0002crete version) of the conformal trasformation that maps\r
the upper half plane into the hyperbolic plane H2.\r
If in the continuum we start with a flat metric in the\r
upper half plane (x, τ), the infinitesimal square line el\u0002ement is given by dx2 + dτ 2\r
, which we can rewrite as\r
τ\r
2\r
(dx2/τ 2 +dτ 2/τ 2). Then a local change of scale (Weyl\r
re-scaling) by τ\r
−1\r
(that is, by an amount that depends on\r
the Euclidean time coordinate τ) produces a new metric\r
dx2 + dτ 2 → (dx2/τ 2 + dτ 2/τ 2) (11)\r
which corresponds to H2. Finally, we have also replaced\r
the Euclidean time coordinate τ with the scale coordi\u0002FIG. 8. Sequence of elementary steps involved in TNR. (a)\r
Each block of four tensors A is approximately replaced with\r
an auxiliary tensor B, as well as disentanglers u and isometries\r
vL and vR. The last three are determined through a local\r
optimization [17], that is, one that only knows about the four\r
tensors A and is therefore insensitive to the rest of the tensor\r
network. (b) Definition of the auxiliary tensor B in terms of\r

Returning to the discrete geometry of the square ten\u0002sor network, notice that the net effect of iterating TNR\r
on the (discrete) upper half plane as discussed above is\r
that we are introducing a change of scale where locally\r
the metric is changed by an amount proportional to the\r
distance τ = 2sto the boundary, that is exponential in\r
the scale variable s, as in the above conformal transfor\u0002mation.\r
Appendix D.– TNR versus energy minimization\r
In this section we compare the accuracy and efficiency\r
of two methods that allow us to obtain a MERA approxi\u0002mation to the ground state |Ψi of a many-body Hamilto\u0002nian H: (i) TNR and (ii) energy minimization [8, 11, 12].\r
We use the 1D quantum Ising model, with Hamiltonian\r
H =\r
X\r
i\r
XiXi+1 + λ\r
X\r
i\r
Zi, (12)\r
where X and Z are Pauli matrices, as a benchmark model\r
for comparison. The ground state of the Ising Hamilto\u0002nian H at critical magnetic field strength, λ = 1, is rep\u0002resented using a scale-invariant MERA obtained in these\r
two ways. The scale invariant MERA considered here\r
consists of three transitional layers followed by infinitely\r
many copies of a scale-invariant layer [8, 11, 12].\r
TNR.— In the first approach, we start by generating\r
the Euclidean path integral for H, as described in sec-

FIG. 10. (a) Ground state |Ψi of H, represented by a tensor\r
network on the upper half plane made of copies of tensor A.\r
(b) Approximately equivalent tensor network obtained by re\u0002placing blocks of four tensors A with the auxiliary tensor B\r
and disentanglers and isometries, according to Fig. 8(a). (c)\r
The disentanglers annihilate pairwise according to uu† = I,\r
everywhere except at the open boundary. (d) We approxi\u0002mately replace tensor B by the product yx−1\r
according to\r
Fig. 8(c). (e) An approximately equivalent tensor network\r
is obtained by introducing tensor A\r
′\r
and the isometry w,\r
according to Fig. 8(e). (f) The isometries annihilate pair\u0002wise according to ww† = I, everywhere except near the open\r
boundary. The net result is thus a coarse-grained tensor net\u0002work on the upper half plane with tensors A\r
′\r
and a row of\r
disentanglers u and isometries w at the open boundary, which\r
define a layer of the MERA.\r
FIG. 11. (a) Relative error in the ground energy (per-spin) for\r
the ground state of the 1D quantum Ising model at criticality,\r

TNR or variational energy minimization. (b) Relative error\r
in the ground energy from (a), now plotted as a function\r

method, which scales as O(χ\r

) for TNR and O(χ\r
9\r
) for energy\r
minimization.\r
tion A. Then we apply four coarse-graining iterations of\r
TNR, after which the flow in the space of tensors has\r
reached an approximate scale-invariant fixed-point Afp,\r
see Eq. 1 in the main text. A scale-invariant MERA\r
is then built from tensors (disentanglers and isometries)\r
produced while implementing TNR, as described in the\r
main text. Here the first three iterations of TNR generate\r
the three transitional layers, while the fourth iteration of\r
TNR is used to build the scale-invariant layer.\r
Energy minimization.— In the second approach, we\r
use the energy minimization algorithm of Ref. [8, 11, 12]\r
to directly optimize a scale-invariant MERA (with three\r
transitional layers preceding the scale-invariant layers) by\r
iteratively minimizing the expectation value of the H.\r
The comparison between the ground energy error δE\r
obtained by the two methods is presented in Fig. 11.\r
For an equivalent bond dimension χ, energy minimiza\u0002tion produces a MERA with smaller error δE than TNR,\r
by a factor k ≈ 10 that is roughly independent of χ. That\r
energy minimization would produce a more accurate es\u0002timate of the ground state energy than TNR was to be\r
expected, for two reasons. First, the energy minimization\r
algorithm directly targets the ground energy as its figure\r
of merits, whereas TNR does not. Second, the energy\r
minimization algorithm optimizes the MERA by sweep\u0002ing back and forth over length scales/layers many times,\r
whereas TNR considers each length scale only once, with\u0002out returning back to optimize shorter length scales after\r
coarse-graining larger length scales.\r
However the cost of optimization also differs between\r
the approaches: the leading order cost of energy mini\u0002mization scales as O(χ\r
9\r
), whereas the cost of TNR scales\r
as O(χ\r
6\r
). There is also a significant difference in the\r
number of optimization steps required to reach a con\u0002verged result. The energy minimization algorithm re\u0002quires many more steps to converge, as the algorithm\r
sweeps over scales thousands of times, compared to TNR,\r
which treats each scale only once. The difference between\r
the two approaches in terms of the number of optimiza\u0002tion steps required is difficult to quantify as it depends on\r
many factors, but here we find that energy minimization\r
requires roughly an order of magnitude more steps than\r
TNR. Fig. 11(b) compares the energy error δE between\r
energy minimization and TNR as a function of the lead\u0002ing order computational costs of the approaches. Even\r
though this comparison does not take into account the\r
difference in the number of optimization steps between\r
the approaches, TNR is already seen to be more compu\u0002tationally efficient in producing a MERA approximation\r
to the ground state within some specified accuracy δE\r
than the energy minimization algorithm.\r
Appendix E.– TRG yields a tree tensor network\r
(TTN)\r
The main result of this paper is to show that when\r
TNR is applied to a tensor network representing the Eu\u0002clidean path integral of a quantum Hamiltonian H (re-

10\r
stricted to the upper-half plane), it generates a MERA\r
approximation for the ground state of H. In this sec\u0002tion we show an analogous result for TRG: we show that\r
when applied to the same tensor network, it generates\r
instead a tree tensor network (TTN) approximation for\r
the ground state of H.\r
This result, which extends to several generalizations of\r
TRG, offers an alternative perspective to understand the\r
qualitative differences between TRG and TNR, and pro\u0002vides a robust theoretical argument for why TRG can\u0002not realize a critical fixed-point tensor while TNR can\r
[17]. Indeed, the failure of TRG to produce a critical\r
fixed-point tensor can be understood to follow from the\r
well-known fact that the TTN ansatz (with fixed bond\r
dimension) cannot reproduce the logarithmic scaling of\r
entanglement entropy, SL ∼ log(L), found in the ground\r
states of 1D quantum systems at a critical point.\r
For simplicity, we will derive this result not for the\r
original TRG, but for an improved version known as\r
higher order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG),\r
which was proposed in Ref.[38]. However, the same con\u0002clusions can also be shown to hold for the square-lattice\r
form of the original TRG algorithm proposed in Ref.[5].\r
We begin with brief summary of HOTRG, see Fig. 12.\r
Consider a square lattice tensor network made of copies\r
of a tensor A with components Aijkl and bond dimension\r
χ. In HOTRG, one coarse-grains the tensor network first\r
in one direction and then in the other. We shall begin\r
with the horizontal axis. In the first step, left-right pairs\r
of tensors A are multiplied together, obtaining the six\u0002index tensor A˜,\r
A˜\r
i,j1,j2,k,l1,l2 ≡\r
X\r
p\r
Ai,j1,p,l1Ap,j2,k,l2, (13)\r
as shown in Fig.12(a). We now should truncate the dou\u0002ble indices j ≡ (j1j2) and l ≡ (l1l2) of A˜, which are of\r
dimension χ\r
2\r
, down to dimension χ. In HOTRG this\r
truncation is performed using a generalized form of the\r
SVD called the higher order singular value decomposition\r
(HOSVD), a method of decomposing an N rank tensor\r
into the product of a core tensor and a set of isometric\r
tensors. Using the HOSVD, the tensor A˜ is approxi\u0002mately decomposed into a core tensor B (with all four\r
indices of dimension χ), and a pair of isometries w and\r
w\r
†\r
(with their three indices also of dimension χ),\r

see also Fig. 12(a). [Note that we are assuming, for\r
simplicity, that the network is invariant under spatial re\u0002flection along the horizontal axis such that the top and\r
bottom isometries w are conjugates of one another, al\u0002though the same result could also be reached without\r
this simplifying assumption.] Isometries w satisfy the\r
FIG. 12. (a) A left-right pair of tensors A is multiplied\r
to form a new tensor A˜, which is then decomposed using a\r
truncated HOSVD into the product of a core tensor B and a\r
pair of isometries w, see also Eqs. 13 and 14. (b) The prod\u0002uct of an isometry w and its conjugate produces the identity,\r
see Eq. 16. (c) A up-down pair of tensors B is multiplied\r
to form a new tensor B˜, which is then decomposed using a\r
truncated HOSVD into the product of a core tensor A\r
′\r
and a\r
pair of isometries v. (d) The product of an isometry v and its\r
conjugate produces the identity. (e) The sequence of trans\u0002formations from (a-d) above is used to coarse grain a 4 × 4\r
network of tensors A, yielding a 2 × 2 network of tensors A\r

as depicted in Fig.12(b). After the HOSVD, we obtain\r
a new square lattice tensor network composed of tensors\r
B and rescaled by a factor of 2 in the horizontal direc\u0002tion. Following the same steps but now in the vertical\r
direction, up-down pairs of tensors B are multiplied to\u0002gether to form a six-index tensor B˜, which can then be\r
decomposed using the HOSVD into a product of a core\r
tensor A′ and a pair of isometries v and v\r
†\r
, see Fig.12(c).\r
[Again, for simplicity, we have assumed that the network\r
is invariant under appropriate spatial reflection.] The\r
combination of horizontal and vertical contraction steps\r
has taken the initial square lattice network of tensors A\r
to a new network of tensors A′, one which is rescaled by\r
a factor of 2 on both axes. This constitutes a single itera\u0002tion of the HOTRG approach. By iteration, we generate\r
a sequence of increasingly coarse-grained lattices defined

Let us now apply HOTRG to a square lattice tensor\r
network representation of the ground state of a Hamilto\u0002nian H on a periodic chain of size L, as we did in the main\r
text for TNR. The network consists of a semi-infinite, ver\u0002tical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices at the\r
bottom, see Fig. 13(a). Each coarse-graining iteration\r
rescales the bulk of the network by a linear factor of 2,\r
while leaving a row of isometries w along the open bound\u0002ary, see Fig.13. After about log2\r
(L) coarse-graining steps\r
the size of the system has effectively become O(1), and\r
we have O(log2(L)) layers of the TTN connected to a\r
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite\r
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a\r
transfer matrix T ; taking the dominant eigenvector of T\r
as the top tensor of the TTN leads to the ground state\r
of H. Thus the HOTRG approach, applied to the Eu\u0002clidean path integral of a quantum system H, has been\r
shown to generate a TTN approximation for its ground\r
state.\r
Since the introduction of TRG, a significant improve\u0002ment in renormalization schemes for tensor networks has\r
been the use of the so-called environment to achieve a\r
more accurate truncation. The second renormalization\r
group (SRG) proposed in Ref.[39] uses to knowledge from\r
the environment, obtained approximately by iteratively\r
sweeping over all length scales, to allow the tensor trun\u0002cations to be performed so as to minimize the global er\u0002ror, as opposed to the local error minimized in TRG and\r
HOTRG. Ref. [38] introduced a version of SRG based\r
upon HOSVD, called the HOSRG, which we will now\r
consider. The use of the environment allows HOSRG\r
to more accurately discern which degrees of freedom can\r
be truncated, and which should be retained, at each RG\r
step. This allows for a smarter choice of isometries. How\u0002ever, HOSRG is structurally still based upon the same\r
blocking scheme as HOTRG, Fig.12(e). It follows that\r
HOSRG also leads to a TTN representation of ground\r
and excited states as depicted in Fig.13. The only dif\u0002ference being that the isometries w that compose the\r
TTN have been better chosen with HOSRG than with\r
HOTRG, as they minimize the global error. In particu\u0002lar, for the same bond dimension χ, HOSRG may pro\u0002duce a more accurate TTN approximation to the ground\r
state than HOTRG.\r
However, as it happens with HOTRG (and TRG),\r
HOSRG cannot generate a proper RG flow in the space\r
of tensors – that is, one that at criticality flows to a criti\u0002cal fixed-point tensor. Indeed, HOSRG produces a TTN,\r
which is known to only be able to accurately describe a\r
critical system if the bond dimension grows with increas\u0002ing scale. But a bond dimension that grows with scale is\r
incompatible with having a fixed-point tensor."""

We show how to build a multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) representa\u0002tion of the ground state of a many-body Hamiltonian H by applying the recently proposed tensor\r
network renormalization (TNR) [G. Evenbly and G. Vidal, arXiv:1412.0732] to the Euclidean time\r
evolution operator e\r
−βH for infinite β. This approach bypasses the costly energy minimization of\r
previous MERA algorithms and, when applied to finite inverse temperature β, produces a MERA\r
representation of a thermal Gibbs state. Our construction endows TNR with a renormalization\r
group flow in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians (and not merely in the more abstract\r
space of tensors) and extends the MERA formalism to classical statistical systems.\r

Consider a strongly interacting quantum many-body\r
system in D spatial dimensions described by a micro\u0002scopic Hamiltonian H. Understanding its collective, low\r
energy behavior is a main goal in condensed matter and\r
high energy physics, one that poses a formidable theoret\u0002ical challenge. To tackle this problem, plenty of methods\r
have been proposed based on the renormalization group\r
(RG) [1–3], that is, on studying how the physics depends\r
on the scale of observation. Weakly interacting systems\r
can be addressed perturbatively using momentum space\r
RG [2]. Instead, strongly interacting systems often re\u0002quire non-perturbative, real space RG methods, as pio\u0002neered by Kadanoff [1] and Wilson [2].\r
Improving on Kadanoff and Wilson’s proposals,\r
White’s density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\r
for quantum spin chains [4] established how to systemati\u0002cally preserve the ground state wave-function during real\u0002space coarse-graining – namely, by preserving the sup\u0002port of its reduced density matrix. Similarly, Levin and\r
Nave’s tensor renormalization group (TRG) [5] taught\r
us how to coarse-grain Euclidean path integrals of one\u0002dimensional quantum systems (also partition functions\r
of two-dimensional classical systems). Both DMRG and\r
TRG are very successful, versatile approaches. However,\r
they depart significantly from the spirit of the RG, in\r
that they produce a coarse-grained, effective description\r
of the system that still retains some irrelevant micro\u0002scopic details. As a result, these methods (i) fail to define\r
a proper RG flow, one with e.g. the correct structure of\r
fixed points; and (ii) struggle to deal with critical systems\r
or systems in D ≥ 2 dimensions, where the accumulation\r
of irrelevant microscopic degrees of freedom is more sig\u0002nificant and harmful.\r
These difficulties have been solved with two closely re\u0002lated proposals. First, entanglement renormalization was\r
put forward to address the above two problems in the\r
context of ground state wave-functions [6, 7]. By intro\u0002ducing disentanglers, which remove short-range entangle\u0002ment, a proper RG flow is generated, as well as an RG\r
transformation that is computationally sustainable even\r
at criticality. In addition, entanglement renormalization\r
leads to an efficient tensor network description of ground\r
states for critical systems, the multi-scale entanglement\r
renormalization ansatz (MERA) [7], of interest not only\r
as a many-body variational state [7–14] but also as a lat\u0002tice realization of the holographic principle [15, 16].\r
Tensor network renormalization (TNR), on the other\r
hand, was more recently proposed to tackle the same\r
problems in the context of Euclidean path integrals (and\r
classical statistical systems) [17]. The Euclidean path\r
integral Z ≡ tr e\r
−βH\u0001\r
is represented by a tensor net\u0002work, consisting of copies of a single tensor A [18], which\r
extends both in space and Euclidean time directions.\r
Through local manipulation of this tensor network, TNR\r
produces a sequence of tensors,\r
A → A\r
′ → A′′ → · · · → Afp, (1)\r
corresponding to increasing length scales, which flow to\u0002wards some infrared fixed-point tensor Afp. The later\r
retains only the universal features of the phase or phase\r
transition [17]. Once again, the key of the approach is\r
the removal of short-range correlations by disentanglers.\r
In this Letter we establish a close connection between\r
the two approaches. We show that, when applied to the\r
Euclidean path integral restricted to the upper half plane,\r
TNR generates a MERA for the ground state of Hamilto\u0002nian H. More generally, TNR also produces a MERA for\r
the thermal Gibbs state ρβ ≡ e\r
−βH/Z at finite inverse\r
temperature β, as well as for the low energy eigenstates\r
of H on a finite periodic chain. Our result provides an\r
alternative route to the MERA, one that bypasses the\r
costly energy minimization of previous algorithms [8, 9]\r
and has several other significant advantages, both con\u0002ceptual and computational, that we also discuss. Among\r
those, we emphasize that (i) we obtain the first correct\r
MERA representation of the thermal state ρβ [19], to-

2\r
gether with an algorithm to find it; (ii) the connection\r
implies that TNR produces an RG flow in the space of\r
wave-functions and Hamiltonians, and not just in the ab\u0002stract space of tensors, Eq. 1; (iii) the MERA formalism\r
can be applied now also to classical statistical systems.\r
For simplicity, we consider a translation invariant system\r
in D = 1 dimensions, although the key results generalize\r
to inhomogeneous systems in dimension D ≥ 1.\r
Tensor network for Euclidean time evolution.— Given\r
a translation invariant Hamiltonian H in one dimen\u0002sion, we use a standard procedure [20] to produce a\r
two-dimensional tensor network representation of the Eu\u0002clidean time operator e\r
−βH or Euclidean path integral\r
tr e\r
−βH\u0001\r
. This tensor network is made of copies of a\r
single tensor A. If both the system size L and the in\u0002verse temperature β are infinite, then the network spans\r
the entire (x, τ)-plane, where x and τ label space and Eu\u0002clidean time, respectively. Here we will consider tensor\r
networks for e\r
−βH on three different geometries, obtained\r
by introducing a horizontal cut at τ = 0 and by choosing\r
L and β to be either finite or infinite [21].\r
TNR yields MERA.— Let us start with the upper half\r
plane, Fig. 1, which corresponds to the ground state |Ψi\r
of H on an infinite lattice. The network has an open\r
boundary at τ = 0, with an infinite row of open indices,\r
one for each site of the one-dimensional lattice on which\r
H acts. We first apply TNR everywhere on the upper half\r
plane except near τ = 0, where we keep the open indices\r
of the tensor network untouched. TNR acts through an\r
intrincate sequence of local replacements [17]. Here we\r
skip the technical details [22] and focus instead on de\u0002scribing the final result: a coarse-grained tensor network\r
with effective tensor A′for most of the upper half plane,\r
in accordance with Eq. 1, together with a double row\r
of special tensors, so-called disentanglers and isometries,\r
which correspond to one layer of the MERA [23]. These\r
tensors connect the microscopic degrees of freedom at\r
length scale s = 0 (represented by the original open in\u0002dices of the network) with the coarse-grained degrees of\r
freedom at length scale s = 1 (represented by the lower\r
indices of the lowest row of tensors A′). We can now re\u0002peat the process on tensors A′\r
, to obtain coarse-grained\r
tensors A′′ and a second row of disentanglers and isome\u0002tries, i.e. a second layer of the MERA, connecting scales\r
s = 1 and 2. Iteration then produces a full MERA ap\u0002proximation for the ground state |Ψi of H, encompassing\r
all length scales s = 0, 1, 2, · · · .\r
Thermal MERA.— Let us now consider a horizontal\r
strip of finite width β, Fig. 2(a), which is proportional\r
to the thermal state ρβ ≡ e\r
−βH/Z. This time we have\r
two boundaries, each with an infinite row of open in\u0002dices: the incoming and outgoing indices of the Euclidean\r
time evolution operator e\r
−βH. As before, we use TNR\r
to coarse-grain the tensor network, except near its open\r
boundaries, where we do not touch the open indices. Fig.\r
2(b) shows the net result: a coarse-grained tensor net\u0002FIG. 1. (a) Tensor network the ground state |Ψi of H on an\r
infinite lattice. It is made of copies of tensor A and restricted\r
to the upper half plane (x, τ +), with a row of open indices\r
at τ = 0. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor network while\r
leaving the open indices untouched, we obtain a new tensor\r
network with tensors A\r
′\r
together with one row of disenta\u0002glers and isometries. (c) Further coarse-graining of the tensor\r
network produces new coarse-grained tensors A\r
′′ and a sec\u0002ond layer of disentanglers and isometries. (d) By iteration we\r
obtain a full MERA approximation for state |Ψi.\r
work, with effective tensor A′, together with a double\r
row of disentanglers and isometries both for the incoming\r
and outgoing indices. After O(log2(β)) iterations of the\r
coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a MERA represen\u0002tation of the thermal state, Fig. 2(c) made of O(log2\r
(β))\r
double layers of disentanglers and isometries for both the\r
incoming and outgoing indices, together with a central\r
row of tensors. Disentanglers and isometries are isomet\u0002ric tensors and thus do not affect the spectrum of eigen\u0002values of the thermal MERA, which therefore depends\r
exclusively on the central row of tensors [24].\r
The thermal MERA obtained from TNR resembles the\r
form first suggested by Swingle in the context of holog\u0002raphy [15], where a 1+1 conformal field theory is dual\r
to a gravity theory in 3 space-time dimensions. In this\r
context, the thermal MERA is interpreted as describing a\r
space-like cross-section of a black hole space-time geome\u0002try. A significant difference in our construction is the cen\u0002tral row of tensors, which is absent in Swingle’s proposal\r
[15] and provides ρβ with the correct thermal spectrum\r
of eigenvalues {e\r
−βEi /Z}, where {Ei} are the eigenval\u0002ues of H. This central row of tensors can be thought of\r
as representing the Einstein-Rosen bridge connecting the\r
two asymptotic AdS regions [25], which seems to provide\r
a manifestation of the ER=EPR conjecture [26].\r
Periodic chain of size L.— In our third construction,\r
we use TNR to coarse-grain a tensor network for the\r
ground state of Hamiltonian H on a periodic chain of size\r
L, see Fig. 3(a). The network consists of a semi-infinite,"""

[[sections]]

title = "FIG. 2. (a) Tensor network on an infinite strip of finite"
text = """
width β, with two rows of open indices. It is proportional to\r
the thermal state e\r
−βH/Z. (b) By coarse-graining the tensor\r
network while leaving the open indices untouched, we obtain\r
a new tensor network with tensors A\r
′\r
together with an up\u0002per and lower row of disentaglers and isometries. (c) Futher\r
coarse-graining produces a thermal MERA.\r
vertical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices.\r
After about O(log2(L)) coarse-graining steps the size of\r
the system has effectively become O(1), see Fig. 3(c), and\r
we have O(log2(L)) layers of the MERA connected to a\r
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite\r
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a\r
transfer matrix T . The dominant eigenvector of T leads\r
to the ground state of H, whereas subdominant eigen\u0002vectors describe low energy eigenstates.\r
To illustrate the computational possibilities offered\r
by the new algorithm, we consider the one-dimensional\r
quantum Ising model with transverse magnetic field both\r
at finite β for an infinite chain, and at zero temperature\r
for a finite periodic chain of length L [27]. The calcu\u0002lation required less than 5 minutes on a 2.5Ghz dual\r
core laptop with 4Gb of memory (MERA bond dimension\r
χ = 10). First, for L = ∞, Fig. 4(a) shows the expecta\u0002tion value of the energy density Ethermal ≡ tr(ρβH)/L as\r
a function of the inverse temperature β, while Fig. 4(b)\r
displays, at critical magnetic field, the crossover between\r
polynomial decay of correlations at short distances (due\r
to quantum fluctuations at criticality) and their exponen\u0002tial decay at longer distances (due to finite temperature\r
statistical fluctuations). Then, for β = ∞, Figs. 4(c)-\r
(d) show, respectively, the low energy spectra of H as a\r
function of the inverse system size 1/L, and the energy\r
and momentum of low energy states for L = 1024. In all\r
cases, an accurate approximation to the exact result is\r
obtained.\r
Discussion.— Since its proposal a decade ago [7], the\r
FIG. 3. (a) Tensor network on a semi-infinite vertical cylin\u0002der of finite width L and with a row of open indices, propor\u0002tional to the ground state of H on a periodic chain made of L\r

while not touching its open indices. (c) MERA connected to\r

eigenvalues correspond to the low energy eigenstates of H. (d)\r
MERA for the ground state/low energy excited states of H,\r
where the top tensor is an eigenvector of the transfer matrix\r
T .\r
MERA has been regarded as a variational class of states.\r
Accordingly, one attempts to approximate the ground\r
state |Ψi of H by optimizing the variational parame\u0002ters contained in the disentanglers and isometries of the\r
MERA, for instance by iteratively minimizing the ex\u0002pectation value of H [8, 9]. Such energy optimization is\r
costly (it may require thousands of sweeps over scale) and\r
prone to becoming trapped in local minima. Moreover,\r
there is no guarantee that the end result is an approx\u0002imation to the ground state |Ψi – one just has a wave\u0002function with, hopefully, reasonably low energy. Here\r
we have argued that, instead, an approximate MERA\r
representation of the ground state |Ψi can be obtained\r
with TNR by coarse-graining an initial, quasi-exact ten\u0002sor network representation of |Ψi [29]. This only requires\r
one sweep over scale, and it is therefore computationally\r
much more efficient [30]. In addition, at each coarse\u0002graining step TNR introduces a truncation error [17] that\r
can be explicitly computed. If this truncation error is\r
sufficiently small, then one can certify that the resulting\r
MERA approximates the true ground state |Ψi within\r
that small error [31].\r
Importantly, TNR acts locally: the coarse-graining of\r
the tensor network at point (x, τ) only depends on the\r
tensors in an immediate neighborhood [17]. Let us men\u0002tion three consequences for the resulting MERA. (i) Since"""

the quantum Ising model H =\r

appear organized according to the conformal towers of the\r

primary fields of the Ising CFT, [28]. Discontinuous lines\r
in (c) and (d) correspond to the finite-size CFT prediction,\r
which ignores corrections of order L\r
−2\r
.\r
TNR is not aware of the system size L or inverse temper\u0002ature β, it produces the same tensors A, A′\r
, A′′, · · · and\r
disentanglers and isometries for the ground state |Ψi in\r
the thermodynamic limit (L = β = ∞) as it does for the\r
states ρβ and |Ψ(L)i at finite β or L. Thus, a single TNR\r
calculation produces an accurate MERA approximation\r
for all these states. (ii) In the absence of translation in\u0002variance, where a different tensor Ai may be required for\r
each site i of the lattice, the coarse-graining of different\r
parts of the system can be conducted in parallel, leading\r
to a massive reduction in computational time. (iii) At a\r
conceptual level, locality of TNR implies the validity of\r
the theory of minimal updates [33]. This theory, which\r
asserts that only certain parts of the MERA need to be\r
changed in order to account for a localized change in the\r
Hamiltonian H [33], is particularly useful in the study of\r
systems with boundaries, defects, or interfaces [9, 14].\r
In Summary, in this Letter we have shown that, when\r
applied to the Euclidean path integral restricted to sev\u0002eral geometries, TNR [17] produces a MERA for the\r
ground state and thermal states of a quantum Hamil\u0002tonian, and have explored a number of consequences of\r
this result. We conclude by briefly mentioning two more\r
implications. First, thanks to this connection, TNR in\u0002herits from the MERA its ability to define an RG flow\r
in the space of wave-functions and Hamiltonians [6–8].\r
Notice that extracting the emergent physics from these\r
RG flows should be easier (both conceptually and com\u0002putationally) than extracting it from the RG flow in the\r
more abstract space of tensors, Eq. 1. Second, although\r
we have focused on quantum systems, TNR can also be\r
applied to statistical partition functions [17]. Therefore\r
the present construction extends the MERA formalism\r
(including strategies to extract universal critical proper\u0002ties [10–14]) to classical statistical systems.\r

[23] On the plane, the double row of disentanglers and isome\u0002tries will annihilate with a double row of conjugate disen\u0002tanglers and isometries corresponding to τ < 0. Instead,\r
on the half upper plane, these tensors remain.\r
[24] The normalization factor Z corresponds to the trace of\r
the thermal MERA. Since the conjugate layers of disen\u0002tanglers and isometries do not change this trace, Z is also\r
the trace of the central row of tensors A\r
max, or an infinite\r
power of some (transfer) matrix M obtained from tensor\r
A\r
max by contracting its vertical indices. A normalized\r
thermal MERA is then obtained by replacing A\r

A\r

path integral\r
In this section we describe how to obtain a conve\u0002nient, quasi-exact tensor network representation of the\r
partition function/Euclidean time path integral Z ≡\r
tr E−βH\u0001(or Euclidean time evolution operator e\r
−βH),\r
starting from the short-ranged Hamiltonian H of a 1D\r
quantum system on the lattice. This tensor network is\r
used in the main text as the starting point to obtain\r
MERA representations for the ground state and thermal\r
states of H in infinite and finite systems, see also Ap\u0002pendix B. It is also used in Appendix C.\r
For simplicity, we assume that H is a sum of nearest\r
neighbor terms only,\r
H =\r
X\r
i\r
hi,i+1 (2)\r
[Longer- (but finite-) range terms can be treated with a\r
slightly more complicated scheme.] The first step is to\r
split H into two contributions, H = Heven + Hodd\r
Heven ≡\r
X\r
even i\r
hi,i+1, Hodd ≡\r
X\r
odd i\r
hi,i+1, (3)\r
and use a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [34] to approx\u0002imately express e\r
βH as the P-fold product of operators\r

This introduces an error of order O(βǫ), which therefore\r
vanishes in the limit of small ǫ/large P. [One can ob\u0002tain an error O(β(ǫ)\r
n), n > 1, by using a higher order\r
Suzuki-Trotter decomposition [35]]. Since Heven is a sum\r
of terms that act on different sites and therefore com\u0002mute, e\r
ǫHeven is simply a product of two-site gates, and\r
similarly for e\r

Each two-site gate e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 is a tensor made of four in\u0002dices. Therefore we have obtained a tensor network rep\u0002resentation of e\r
−βH, see Fig. 5(a). Using singular value\r
decompositions (in the vertical and horizontal direction,\r
as indicated in the inset of Fig. 5) we can then transform\r
this tensor network into a new tensor network made of\r
four-legged tensors A connected according to a square\r
lattice pattern.\r
However, by construction e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 is very close to the\r
identity, e\r
−ǫhi,i+1 = I + O(ǫ), which implies that the\r
square tensor network is highly anisotropic. It is then\r
convenient to coarse-grain in the Euclidean time direc\u0002tion, until space and time direction have become qualita\u0002tively equivalent, in the sense e.g. that the ordered sin\u0002gular values of a tensor in both directions decay roughly\r
in the same way. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.\r

new tensor A˜. (c) In the new tensor network, each row of ten\u0002sors A˜ accounts for two rows of tensors A, in such a way that\r
the anisotropy between space and Euclidean time directions\r
has been reduced. The initial square tensor network discussed\r
in the main text is the result of applying this compression in\r
the Euclidean time directions a few times."""

time evolution\r
In this section we review the well-known fact that\r

is pro\u0002portional to the thermal state ρ\r

where L denotes the length of a periodic chain and β\r
is the inverse temperature. Here we use H(L) and H ≡\r
H(L→∞)to denote a Hamiltonian on a periodic lattice of\r
size L and on an infinite lattice, respectively.\r
We consider four geometries, obtained from combina\u0002tions of infinite and finite L and β. These geometries are\r
represented in Fig. 7. The partition function Z\r
(L)\r
β\r
corre\u0002sponds to a torus of size L and β in the horizontal and\r
vertical directions, respectively, which are parameterized\r
by space and Euclidean time coordinates (x, τ). Then\r
e\r
−βH(L)\r
corresponds to the vertical cylinder obtained by\r
cutting the torus at τ = 0, as represented in Fig. 7(d).\r
At infinite length L, this cylinder is replaced by an\r
infinite strip of finite width β, representing e\r
−βH, which\r
is proportional to the thermal state ρβ of Fig. 7(b), with\r
ρβ ≡ lim\r

ρ\r

At infinite inverse temperature β (or zero temperature)\r
we obtain a projector\r

|Ψ(L)i ∝ lim\r

Therefore, for finite L, the Euclidean time evolution op\u0002erator on a semi-infinite vertical cylinder is proportional\r
to the ground state |Ψ(L)i of H(L), Fig. 7(c).\r
Finally, for infinite β and L, the semi-infinite cylinder\r
above is replaced with the upper half plane and produces\r
the ground state |Ψi of H, Fig. 7(a).\r
We have therefore attached a geometry to each of the\r
ground states and thermal states |Ψi, ρβ, |Ψ(L)i, and\r

finite cylinder (d)] is left as an exercise that follows from\r
the previous cases.\r

Appendix C.— Tensor Network Renormalization,\r
step by step\r
In this section we review the detailed sequence of local\r
replacements that define the coarse-graining transforma\u0002tion of TNR. For convenience, we have introduced some\r
cosmetic changes compared to Ref. [17].\r
The actual sequence is shown in Fig. 8. It\r
involves a number of intermediate tensors (namely\r
B, u, vL, vR, x, y, w) in addition to the final coarse\u0002grained tensor A′\r
. When applied to an infinite square\r
tensor network made of copies of tensor A, Fig. 9, these\r
local replacements produce a coarse-grained tensor net\u0002work made of copies of a new tensor A′\r
, where there is a\r
copy of A′for every four initial tensors A. None of the\r
intermediate tensors appear in the coarse-grained tensor\r
network. We can think of TNR as implementing a global\r
change of scale, from (x, τ) to (x\r
′\r
, τ′) where\r
x → x\r
′ = x/2, τ → τ′ = τ /2. (10)\r
Let us now consider instead applying TNR to coarse\u0002grain the restriction of the initial square tensor network\r
on the upper half plane, as represented in Fig. 10. Recall\r
that this restriction defines a projector onto the ground\r
state of H. By applying the sequence as local replace\u0002ments of Fig. 8, we see that most of the upper half plane\r
ends up in a coarse-grained square tensor network again\r
made of tensors A′. However, near the open boundary of

8\r
the tensor network first a row of disentanglers u, and then\r
a row of isometries w, accumulate. These disentanglers\r
and isometries cannot annihilate with Hermitian conju\u0002gates u\r
† and w† because those would belong to the lower\r
half plane, which is not available.\r
As discussed in the main text and Fig.1 of the main\r
text, iteration of the coarse-graining produces a full\r
MERA for the ground state |Ψi of H. Let us now give a\r
geometrical interpretation of this construction. It turns\r
out that TNR allows to implement local scale transfor\u0002mations on the lattice [36], that is, a discrete version\r
of certain conformal transformations in the continuum.\r
From this perspective, the MERA results from (the dis\u0002crete version) of the conformal trasformation that maps\r
the upper half plane into the hyperbolic plane H2.\r
If in the continuum we start with a flat metric in the\r
upper half plane (x, τ), the infinitesimal square line el\u0002ement is given by dx2 + dτ 2\r
, which we can rewrite as\r
τ\r
2\r
(dx2/τ 2 +dτ 2/τ 2). Then a local change of scale (Weyl\r
re-scaling) by τ\r
−1\r
(that is, by an amount that depends on\r
the Euclidean time coordinate τ) produces a new metric\r
dx2 + dτ 2 → (dx2/τ 2 + dτ 2/τ 2) (11)\r
which corresponds to H2. Finally, we have also replaced\r
the Euclidean time coordinate τ with the scale coordi\u0002FIG. 8. Sequence of elementary steps involved in TNR. (a)\r
Each block of four tensors A is approximately replaced with\r
an auxiliary tensor B, as well as disentanglers u and isometries\r

Returning to the discrete geometry of the square ten\u0002sor network, notice that the net effect of iterating TNR\r
on the (discrete) upper half plane as discussed above is\r
that we are introducing a change of scale where locally\r
the metric is changed by an amount proportional to the\r
distance τ = 2sto the boundary, that is exponential in\r
the scale variable s, as in the above conformal transfor\u0002mation.\r
Appendix D.– TNR versus energy minimization\r
In this section we compare the accuracy and efficiency\r
of two methods that allow us to obtain a MERA approxi\u0002mation to the ground state |Ψi of a many-body Hamilto\u0002nian H: (i) TNR and (ii) energy minimization [8, 11, 12].\r

H =\r

X\r

Zi, (12)\r
where X and Z are Pauli matrices, as a benchmark model\r
for comparison. The ground state of the Ising Hamilto\u0002nian H at critical magnetic field strength, λ = 1, is rep\u0002resented using a scale-invariant MERA obtained in these\r
two ways. The scale invariant MERA considered here\r
consists of three transitional layers followed by infinitely\r
many copies of a scale-invariant layer [8, 11, 12].\r

tion A. Then we apply four coarse-graining iterations of\r
TNR, after which the flow in the space of tensors has\r
reached an approximate scale-invariant fixed-point Afp,\r
see Eq. 1 in the main text. A scale-invariant MERA\r
is then built from tensors (disentanglers and isometries)\r
produced while implementing TNR, as described in the\r
main text. Here the first three iterations of TNR generate\r
the three transitional layers, while the fourth iteration of\r
TNR is used to build the scale-invariant layer.\r
Energy minimization.— In the second approach, we\r
use the energy minimization algorithm of Ref. [8, 11, 12]\r
to directly optimize a scale-invariant MERA (with three\r
transitional layers preceding the scale-invariant layers) by\r
iteratively minimizing the expectation value of the H.\r
The comparison between the ground energy error δE\r
obtained by the two methods is presented in Fig. 11.\r
For an equivalent bond dimension χ, energy minimiza\u0002tion produces a MERA with smaller error δE than TNR,\r
by a factor k ≈ 10 that is roughly independent of χ. That\r
energy minimization would produce a more accurate es\u0002timate of the ground state energy than TNR was to be\r
expected, for two reasons. First, the energy minimization\r
algorithm directly targets the ground energy as its figure\r
of merits, whereas TNR does not. Second, the energy\r
minimization algorithm optimizes the MERA by sweep\u0002ing back and forth over length scales/layers many times,\r
whereas TNR considers each length scale only once, with\u0002out returning back to optimize shorter length scales after\r
coarse-graining larger length scales.\r
However the cost of optimization also differs between\r
the approaches: the leading order cost of energy mini\u0002mization scales as O(χ\r
9\r
), whereas the cost of TNR scales\r
as O(χ\r
6\r
). There is also a significant difference in the\r
number of optimization steps required to reach a con\u0002verged result. The energy minimization algorithm re\u0002quires many more steps to converge, as the algorithm\r
sweeps over scales thousands of times, compared to TNR,\r
which treats each scale only once. The difference between\r
the two approaches in terms of the number of optimiza\u0002tion steps required is difficult to quantify as it depends on\r
many factors, but here we find that energy minimization\r
requires roughly an order of magnitude more steps than\r
TNR. Fig. 11(b) compares the energy error δE between\r
energy minimization and TNR as a function of the lead\u0002ing order computational costs of the approaches. Even\r
though this comparison does not take into account the\r
difference in the number of optimization steps between\r
the approaches, TNR is already seen to be more compu\u0002tationally efficient in producing a MERA approximation\r
to the ground state within some specified accuracy δE\r
than the energy minimization algorithm.\r
Appendix E.– TRG yields a tree tensor network\r
(TTN)\r
The main result of this paper is to show that when\r
TNR is applied to a tensor network representing the Eu\u0002clidean path integral of a quantum Hamiltonian H (re-

10\r
stricted to the upper-half plane), it generates a MERA\r
approximation for the ground state of H. In this sec\u0002tion we show an analogous result for TRG: we show that\r
when applied to the same tensor network, it generates\r
instead a tree tensor network (TTN) approximation for\r
the ground state of H.\r
This result, which extends to several generalizations of\r
TRG, offers an alternative perspective to understand the\r
qualitative differences between TRG and TNR, and pro\u0002vides a robust theoretical argument for why TRG can\u0002not realize a critical fixed-point tensor while TNR can\r
[17]. Indeed, the failure of TRG to produce a critical\r
fixed-point tensor can be understood to follow from the\r
well-known fact that the TTN ansatz (with fixed bond\r
dimension) cannot reproduce the logarithmic scaling of\r
entanglement entropy, SL ∼ log(L), found in the ground\r
states of 1D quantum systems at a critical point.\r
For simplicity, we will derive this result not for the\r
original TRG, but for an improved version known as\r
higher order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG),\r
which was proposed in Ref.[38]. However, the same con\u0002clusions can also be shown to hold for the square-lattice\r
form of the original TRG algorithm proposed in Ref.[5].\r
We begin with brief summary of HOTRG, see Fig. 12.\r
Consider a square lattice tensor network made of copies\r
of a tensor A with components Aijkl and bond dimension\r
χ. In HOTRG, one coarse-grains the tensor network first\r
in one direction and then in the other. We shall begin\r
with the horizontal axis. In the first step, left-right pairs\r
of tensors A are multiplied together, obtaining the six\u0002index tensor A˜,\r
A˜\r

X\r
p\r
Ai,j1,p,l1Ap,j2,k,l2, (13)\r
as shown in Fig.12(a). We now should truncate the dou\u0002ble indices j ≡ (j1j2) and l ≡ (l1l2) of A˜, which are of\r
dimension χ\r
2\r
, down to dimension χ. In HOTRG this\r
truncation is performed using a generalized form of the\r
SVD called the higher order singular value decomposition\r
(HOSVD), a method of decomposing an N rank tensor\r
into the product of a core tensor and a set of isometric\r
tensors. Using the HOSVD, the tensor A˜ is approxi\u0002mately decomposed into a core tensor B (with all four\r
indices of dimension χ), and a pair of isometries w and\r
w\r

(with their three indices also of dimension χ),\r

this simplifying assumption.] Isometries w satisfy the\r

direction, up-down pairs of tensors B are multiplied to\u0002gether to form a six-index tensor B˜, which can then be\r

a factor of 2 on both axes. This constitutes a single itera\u0002tion of the HOTRG approach. By iteration, we generate\r

Let us now apply HOTRG to a square lattice tensor\r
network representation of the ground state of a Hamilto\u0002nian H on a periodic chain of size L, as we did in the main\r
text for TNR. The network consists of a semi-infinite, ver\u0002tical cylinder of width L, with a row of open indices at the\r
bottom, see Fig. 13(a). Each coarse-graining iteration\r
rescales the bulk of the network by a linear factor of 2,\r
while leaving a row of isometries w along the open bound\u0002ary, see Fig.13. After about log2\r
(L) coarse-graining steps\r
the size of the system has effectively become O(1), and\r
we have O(log2(L)) layers of the TTN connected to a\r
semi-infinite cylinder of O(1) width. This semi-infinite\r
cylinder can be understood as the infinite product of a\r
transfer matrix T ; taking the dominant eigenvector of T\r
as the top tensor of the TTN leads to the ground state\r
of H. Thus the HOTRG approach, applied to the Eu\u0002clidean path integral of a quantum system H, has been\r
shown to generate a TTN approximation for its ground\r
state.\r
Since the introduction of TRG, a significant improve\u0002ment in renormalization schemes for tensor networks has\r
been the use of the so-called environment to achieve a\r
more accurate truncation. The second renormalization\r
group (SRG) proposed in Ref.[39] uses to knowledge from\r
the environment, obtained approximately by iteratively\r
sweeping over all length scales, to allow the tensor trun\u0002cations to be performed so as to minimize the global er\u0002ror, as opposed to the local error minimized in TRG and\r
HOTRG. Ref. [38] introduced a version of SRG based\r
upon HOSVD, called the HOSRG, which we will now\r
consider. The use of the environment allows HOSRG\r
to more accurately discern which degrees of freedom can\r
be truncated, and which should be retained, at each RG\r
step. This allows for a smarter choice of isometries. How\u0002ever, HOSRG is structurally still based upon the same\r
blocking scheme as HOTRG, Fig.12(e). It follows that\r
HOSRG also leads to a TTN representation of ground\r
and excited states as depicted in Fig.13. The only dif\u0002ference being that the isometries w that compose the\r
TTN have been better chosen with HOSRG than with\r
HOTRG, as they minimize the global error. In particu\u0002lar, for the same bond dimension χ, HOSRG may pro\u0002duce a more accurate TTN approximation to the ground\r
state than HOTRG.\r
However, as it happens with HOTRG (and TRG),\r
HOSRG cannot generate a proper RG flow in the space\r
of tensors – that is, one that at criticality flows to a criti\u0002cal fixed-point tensor. Indeed, HOSRG produces a TTN,\r
which is known to only be able to accurately describe a\r
critical system if the bond dimension grows with increas\u0002ing scale. But a bond dimension that grows with scale is\r
incompatible with having a fixed-point tensor."""
