GW190814: Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a 23 M\f Black Hole\r
with a 2.6 M\f Compact Object\r
LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration\r
(Dated: June 24, 2020)\r
ABSTRACT\r
We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 – 24.3 M\f black hole and\r
a compact object with a mass of 2.50 – 2.67 M\f (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level).\r
The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing\r
run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector\r
network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of 241+41\r
−45 Mpc; no electromagnetic\r
counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured\r
with gravitational waves, 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole\r
or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless\r
spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to ≤ 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no\r
measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at\r
high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc−3 yr−1for the new class of binary\r
coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass\r
ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in\r
globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger\r
rate for this event challenges all current models for the formation and mass distribution of compact\u0002object binaries.\r
1. INTRODUCTION\r
The first two observing runs (O1 and O2) with\r
Advanced LIGO (Aasi et al. 2015) and Advanced\r
Virgo (Acernese et al. 2015) opened up the field of\r
gravitational-wave astrophysics with the detection of\r
the first binary black hole (BBH) coalescence signal,\r
GW150914 (Abbott et al. 2016a). Another nine such\r
events (Abbott et al. 2016b, 2019a) were discovered by\r
the LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations (LVC)\r
during this period, and additional events were reported\r
by independent groups (Venumadhav et al. 2020; Za\u0002ckay et al. 2019a,b; Nitz et al. 2020). The first binary\r
neutron star (BNS) coalescence signal, GW170817, was\r
discovered during the second of these observing cam\u0002paigns (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2019b). It proved to be a\r
multi-messenger source with emission across the electro\u0002magnetic spectrum (Abbott et al. 2017b), with implica\u0002tions for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts (Abbott\r
et al. 2017c), the formation of heavy elements (Abbott\r
et al. 2017d; Chornock et al. 2017; Tanvir et al. 2017;\r
Rosswog et al. 2018; Kasliwal et al. 2019; Watson et al.\r
2019), cosmology (Abbott et al. 2017e, 2019c) and fun\u0002damental physics (Abbott et al. 2017c, 2019d).\r
The first six months of the third observing run (O3)\r
were completed between April 1 and September 30,\r
2019. The LVC recently reported on the discovery of\r
GW190425, the coalescence signal of what is most likely\r
a BNS with unusually large chirp mass and total mass\r
compared to the Galactic BNSs known from radio pul\u0002sar observations (Abbott et al. 2020a). Another dis\u0002covery from O3 is that of GW190412, the first BBH\r
coalescence with an unequivocally unequal mass ratio\r
q = m2/m1 of 0.28+0.12\r
−0.06 (all measurements are reported\r
as symmetric 90% credible intervals around the median\r
of the marginalized posterior distribution, unless other\u0002wise specified). It is also the first event for which higher\u0002multipole gravitational radiation was detected with high\r
significance (Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
Here we report on another O3 detection, GW190814,\r
the signal of a compact binary coalescence with the\r
most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational\r
waves: q = 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009. The signal was first identified\r
in data from two detectors, LIGO Livingston and Virgo,\r
on 2019 August 14, 21:11:00 UTC. Subsequent analysis\r
of data from the full three-detector network revealed a\r
merger signal with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ' 25.\r

The primary component of GW190814 is conclusively\r
a black hole (BH) with mass m1 = 23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f. Its di\u0002mensionless spin magnitude is constrained to χ1 ≤ 0.07.\r
The nature of the 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f secondary component is\r
unclear. The lack of measurable tidal deformations and\r
the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart are con\u0002sistent with either a neutron star (NS) or a BH given the\r
event’s asymmetric masses and distance of 241+41\r
−45 Mpc.\r
However, we show here that comparisons with the maxi\u0002mum NS mass predicted by studies of GW170817’s rem\u0002nant, by current knowledge of the NS equation of state,\r
and by electromagnetic observations of NSs in binary\r
systems indicate that the secondary is likely too heavy\r
to be a NS. Either way, this is an unprecedented source\r
because the secondary’s well-constrained mass of 2.50–\r
2.67 M\f makes it either the lightest BH or the heaviest\r
NS ever observed in a double compact-object system.\r
As in the case of GW190412, we are able to measure\r
the presence of higher multipoles in the gravitational ra\u0002diation, and a set of tests of general relativity with the\r
signal reveal no deviations from the theory. Treating\r
this event as a new class of compact binary coalescences,\r
we estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc−3 yr−1for\r
GW190814-like events. Forming coalescing compact bi\u0002naries with this unusual combination of masses at such a\r
rate challenges our current understanding of astrophys\u0002ical models.\r
We report on the status of the detector network and\r
the specifics of the detection in Sections 2 and 3. In\r
Section 4, we estimate physical source properties with\r
a set of waveform models, and we assess statistical and\r
systematic uncertainties. Tests of general relativity are\r
described in Section 5. In Section 6, we calculate the\r
merger rate density and discuss implications for the na\u0002ture of the secondary component, compact binary for\u0002mation and cosmology. Section 7 summarizes our find\u0002ings.\r
2. DETECTOR NETWORK\r
At the time of GW190814, LIGO Hanford, LIGO Liv\u0002ingston and Virgo were operating with typical O3 sen\u0002sitivities (Abbott et al. 2020a). Although LIGO Han\u0002ford was in a stable operating configuration at the time\r
of GW190814, the detector was not in observing mode\r
due to a routine procedure to minimize angular noise\r
coupling to the strain measurement (Kasprzack & Yu\r
2017). This same procedure took place at LIGO Han\u0002ford around the time of GW170608; we refer the reader\r
to Abbott et al. (2017f) for details of this procedure.\r
Within a 5 min window around GW190814, this pro\u0002cedure was not taking place, therefore LIGO Hanford\r
data for GW190814 are usable in the nominal range\r

Times are shown relative to 2019 August 14, 21:10:39 UTC.\r
Each detector’s data are whitened by their respective noise\r
amplitude spectral density and a Q-transform is calculated.\r
The colorbar displays the normalized energy reported by the\r
Q-transform at each frequency. These plots are not used in\r
our detection procedure and are for visualization purposes\r
only.\r
of analyzed frequencies. A time–frequency representa\u0002tion (Chatterji et al. 2004) of the data from all three\r
detectors around the time of the signal is shown in Fig\u0002ure 1.\r
We used validation procedures similar to those used\r
to vet previous gravitational-wave events (Abbott et al.\r
2016c, 2019a). Overall we found no evidence that instru\u0002mental or environmental disturbances (Effler et al. 2015)\r
could account for GW190814. However, we did identify\r
low-frequency transient noise due to scattered light at\r
LIGO Livingston, a common source of noise in all three

3\r
interferometers (Nuttall 2018). Scattered light features\r
in the strain data are produced when a small fraction\r
of the main laser beam reflects off a moving surface and\r
is phase modulated before recombining with the main\r
beam. This recombination can result in excess noise\r
with the morphology of arches in the time–frequency\r
plane; the frequency of this noise is determined by the\r
velocity of the moving surface (Accadia et al. 2010).\r
Thunderstorms near LIGO Livingston around the time\r
of GW190814 resulted in acoustic noise coupling to the\r
detector and caused features in the strain data asso\u0002ciated with scattered light (Abbott et al. 2019a). In\r
this instance, this form of noise affects frequencies up\r
to 30 Hz from roughly 22 s to 8 s before and 0.2 s to\r
1.5 s after the detected time of GW190814, as seen in the\r
middle panel of Figure 1. Since this noise could bias the\r
estimation of GW190814’s source parameters, we used a\r
starting frequency of 30 Hz to analyse LIGO Livingston\r
data. Virgo was operating nominally and there are no\r
quality issues in the Virgo data.\r
The LIGO and Virgo detectors are calibrated by pho\u0002ton pressure from modulated auxiliary lasers inducing\r
test-mass motion (Karki et al. 2016; Acernese et al.\r
2018; Viets et al. 2018). Over the frequency range 20–\r
2048 Hz, the maximum 1σ calibration uncertainties for\r
strain data used in the analysis of GW190814 were 6% in\r
amplitude and 4 deg in phase for LIGO data, and 5% in\r
amplitude and 7 deg in phase for Virgo data. These cali\u0002bration uncertainties are propagated into the parameter\r
estimation reported in Section 4 via marginalization.\r
3. DETECTION\r
3.1. Low-latency Identification of a Candidate Event\r
GW190814 was first identified on 2019 August 14,\r
21:11:00 UTC as a loud two-detector event in LIGO\r
Livingston and Virgo data (SNR 21.4 and 4.3) by the\r
low-latency GstLAL matched-filtering search pipeline\r
for coalescing binaries (Cannon et al. 2012; Privitera\r
et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev et al. 2019;\r
Hanna et al. 2020). Matched-filtering searches use\r
banks (Sathyaprakash & Dhurandhar 1991; Blanchet\r
et al. 1995; Owen 1996; Owen & Sathyaprakash 1999;\r
Damour et al. 2001; Blanchet et al. 2005; Cokelaer\r
2007; Harry et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2013; Ajith et al.\r
2014; Harry et al. 2014; Capano et al. 2016b; Roy\r
et al. 2017, 2019; Indik et al. 2018) of modeled gravi\u0002tational waveforms (Buonanno & Damour 1999; Arun\r
et al. 2009; Blanchet 2014; Boh´e et al. 2017; P¨urrer\r
2016) as filter templates. A Notice was issued through\r
NASA’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN) 20\r
min later (LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Col\u0002laboration 2019a) with a two-detector source local\u0002ization computed using the rapid Bayesian algorithm\r
BAYESTAR (Singer & Price 2016) that is shown in\r
Figure 2. The event was initially classified as “Mass\u0002Gap” (Kapadia et al. 2020; LIGO Scientific Collabora\u0002tion, Virgo Collaboration 2019b), implying that at least\r
one of the binary merger components was found to have\r
a mass between 3–5 M\f in the low-latency analyses.\r
Other low-latency searches, including the matched\u0002filtering based MBTA (Adams et al. 2016) and Py\u0002CBC (Usman et al. 2016; Nitz et al. 2017; Nitz et al.\r
2018, 2019) pipelines, could not detect the event at\r
the time as its SNR in Virgo data was below their\r
single-detector detection thresholds. Test versions of\r
MBTA and the additional matched-filtering pipeline\r
SPIIR (Hooper et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012; Guo et al.\r
2018) operating with a lower SNR threshold also iden\u0002tified the event with consistent attributes.\r
Shortly thereafter, reanalyses including LIGO Han\u0002ford data were performed using GstLAL and PyCBC.\r
A coincident gravitational-wave signal was identified in\r
all three detectors by both searches, with SNR 21.6 in\r
LIGO Livingston, 10.6 in LIGO Hanford, and 4.5 in\r
Virgo data (as measured by GstLAL, consistent with\r
SNRs reported by PyCBC). Results of these 3-detector\r
analyses were reported in a GCN Circular within 2.3\r
hours of the time of the event (LIGO Scientific Col\u0002laboration, Virgo Collaboration 2019c,d), providing a\r
3-detector localization (Singer & Price 2016) constrain\u0002ing the distance to 220–330 Mpc and the sky area to\r
38 deg2 at the 90% credible level. Another GCN Cir\u0002cular (LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collabora\u0002tion 2019e) sent 13.5 hours after the event updated the\r
source localization to a distance of 215–320 Mpc, the\r
sky area to 23 deg2, and the source classification to\r
“NSBH” (Kapadia et al. 2020; LIGO Scientific Collabo\u0002ration, Virgo Collaboration 2019b), indicating that the\r
secondary had a mass below 3 M\f. These updated sky\r
localizations are also shown in Figure 2. The two dis\u0002joint sky localizations arise because the low SNR in the\r
Virgo detector (4.5) means that the data are consistent\r
with two different signal arrival times in that detector.\r
3.2. Multi-messenger Follow-up\r
Several external groups performed multi-messenger\r
follow-up of the source with observations across the elec\u0002tromagnetic spectrum (e.g., Lipunov et al. 2019; Gomez\r
et al. 2019; Antier et al. 2020; Andreoni et al. 2020; Do\u0002bie et al. 2019; Watson et al. 2020; Ackley et al. 2020;\r
Vieira et al. 2020) and with neutrino observations (e.g.,\r
Ageron et al. 2019; The IceCube Collaboration 2019).\r
No counterpart candidates were reported. The non\u0002detection is consistent with the source’s highly un-

4\r
equal mass ratio and low primary spin (LIGO Scientific\r
Collaboration, Virgo Collaboration 2019d,e; Fern´andez\r
et al. 2020; Morgan et al. 2020). Tentative constraints\r
placed by multi-messenger studies on the properties of\r
the system, such as the ejecta mass and maximum pri\u0002mary spin (Andreoni et al. 2020; Ackley et al. 2020;\r
Kawaguchi et al. 2020; Coughlin et al. 2020) or the\r
circum-merger density (Dobie et al. 2019) assuming a\r
neutron-star–black-hole (NSBH) source, may need to be\r
revisited in light of the updated source parameters we\r
present in Sec. 4.1.\r
3.3. Significance\r
The significance of GW190814 was estimated by\r
follow-up searches using improved calibration and re\u0002fined data-quality information that are not available in\r
low latency. They also used longer stretches of data for\r
better precision (Abbott et al. 2016b,c). With LIGO\r
Hanford data being usable but not in nominal observing\r
mode at the time of GW190814, we used only data from\r
the LIGO Livingston and Virgo detectors for significance\r
estimation. GW190814 was identified as a confident de\u0002tection in analyses of detector data collected over the\r
period from August 7 to August 15, 2019 by the two in\u0002dependent matched-filtering searches GstLAL and Py\u0002CBC, with SNR values consistent with the low-latency\r
analyses. The production version of PyCBC for O3 es\u0002timates significance only for events that are coincident\r
in the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston detectors,\r
and therefore an extended version (Davies et al. 2020)\r
was used for GW190814 in order to enable the use of\r
Virgo data in significance estimation.\r
GstLAL and PyCBC use different techniques for es\u0002timating the noise background and methods of ranking\r
gravitational-wave candidates. Both use results from\r
searches over non time-coincident data to improve their\r
noise background estimation (Privitera et al. 2014; Mes\u0002sick et al. 2017; Usman et al. 2016). Using data from\r
the first six months of O3 and including all events dur\u0002ing this period in the estimation of noise background,\r
GstLAL estimated a false-alarm rate (FAR) of 1 in\r
1.3 × 103 yr for GW190814. Using data from the 8-day\r
period surrounding GW190814 and including this and\r
all quieter events during this period in noise background\r
estimation, the extended PyCBC pipeline (Davies et al.\r
2020) estimated a FAR for the event of 1 in 8.1 yr.\r
The higher FAR estimate from PyCBC can be at\u0002tributed to the event being identified by the pipeline\r
as being quieter than multiple noise events in Virgo\r
data. As PyCBC estimates background statistics using\r
non-coincident data from both detectors, these louder\r
noise events in Virgo data can form chance coincidences\r

rapid localization algorithm BAYESTAR (Singer & Price\r
2016). The sky localization circulated 13.5 hours after the\r
event, based on a LIGO Hanford–LIGO Livingston–Virgo\r
analysis with the LALInference stochastic sampling soft\u0002ware (Veitch et al. 2015), is shown in green. The purple\r
contour indicates the final sky localization as presented in\r
this paper, which constrains the source to within 18.5 deg2\r
at 90% probability.\r
with the signal in LIGO Livingston data and elevate\r
the noise background estimate for coincident events, es\u0002pecially when considering shorter data periods. All esti\u0002mated background events that were ranked higher than\r
GW190814 by PyCBC were indeed confirmed to be co\u0002incidences of the candidate event itself in LIGO Liv\u0002ingston with random noise events in Virgo. The stated\r
background estimates are therefore conservative (Ca\u0002pano et al. 2016a). We also estimate the background\r
excluding the candidate from the calculation, a proce\u0002dure that yields a mean-unbiased estimation of the dis\u0002tribution of noise events (Capano et al. 2016a; Abbott\r
et al. 2016d). In this case, with GstLAL we found a\r
FAR of < 1 in 105 yr while with PyCBC we found a\r
FAR of < 1 in 4.2 × 104 yr. With both pipelines iden\u0002tifying GW190814 as more significant than any event in\r
the background, the FARs assigned are upper bounds.\r
When data from LIGO Hanford were included,\r
GW190814 was also identified by the unmodelled co\u0002herent Wave Burst (cWB) search that targets generic\r
gravitational-wave transients with increasing frequency\r
over time without relying on waveform models (Kli\u0002menko et al. 2008, 2016; Abbott et al. 2016e). We found\r
a FAR of < 1 in 103 yr of observing time against the\r
noise background from LIGO Hanford and LIGO Liv\u0002ingston data, consistent with the other searches.\r

We infer the physical properties of GW190814 using a\r
coherent Bayesian analysis of the data from LIGO Liv\u0002ingston, LIGO Hanford and Virgo following the method\u0002ology described in Appendix B of Abbott et al. (2019a).\r
Results presented here are obtained using 16 s of data\r
around the time of detection. We use a low-frequency\r
cutoff of 20 Hz for LIGO Hanford and Virgo and 30 Hz\r
for LIGO Livingston for the likelihood evaluations, and\r
we choose uninformative and wide priors, as defined in\r
Appendix B.1 of Abbott et al. (2019a). The LALInfer\u0002ence stochastic sampling software (Veitch et al. 2015) is\r
the primary tool used to sample the posterior distribu\u0002tion. A parallelized version of the parameter estimation\r
software bilby (pbilby; Smith & Ashton 2019; Ashton\r
et al. 2019) is used for computationally expensive signal\r
models. The power spectral density used in the likeli\u0002hood calculations is a fair draw estimate calculated with\r
BayesWave (Cornish & Littenberg 2015; Littenberg &\r
Cornish 2015).\r
This signal is analyzed under two different assump\u0002tions: that it represents a BBH, or that it represents a\r
NSBH. For the BBH analyses, two different waveform\r
families are used, one based on the effective-one-body\r
approach (EOBNR; Boh´e et al. 2017; Babak et al. 2017;\r
Cotesta et al. 2018; Ossokine et al. 2020) and the other\r
on a phenomenological approach (Phenom; Khan et al.\r
2016; Husa et al. 2016; London et al. 2018; Khan et al.\r
2019; Khan et al. 2020).\r
For the NSBH analyses, we use BBH waveform mod\u0002els augmented with tidal effects (Matas et al. 2020;\r
Thompson et al. 2020). Systematic uncertainties due\r
to waveform modeling are expected to be subdomi\u0002nant compared to statistical errors (Huang et al. 2020).\r
When sampling the parameter space with the SEOB\u0002NRv4 ROM NRTidalv2 NSBH (Matas et al. 2020)\r
and IMRPhenomNSBH (Thompson et al. 2020) wave\u0002form models, we obtained posterior distributions for\r
the secondary component’s tidal deformability Λ2 that\r
are uninformative relative to a uniform prior in Λ2 ∈\r
[0, 3000]. The absence of a measurable tidal signature is\r
consistent with the highly unequal mass ratio (Foucart\r
et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2017) and with the relatively\r
large secondary mass (Flanagan & Hinderer 2008). The\r
large asymmetry in the masses implies that the binary\r
will merge before the neutron star is tidally disrupted for\r
any expected NS equation of state (Foucart et al. 2013).\r
Given that the signal carries no discernible information

6\r
about matter effects, here we present quantitative re\u0002sults only from BBH waveform models.\r
Our primary analyses include the effect of subdom\u0002inant multipole moments in precessing waveform tem\u0002plate models (PHM): IMRPhenomPv3HM (Phenom\r
PHM; Khan et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2020) from the phe\u0002nomenological family and SEOBNRv4PHM (EOBNR\r
PHM; Babak et al. 2017; Ossokine et al. 2020) from the\r
EOBNR family.1 Analyses that assume the spins are\r
aligned with the orbital angular momentum were also\r
performed, either including (Phenom/EOBNR HM) or\r
excluding (Phenom/EOBNR) the effect of subdominant\r
multipole moments.\r
4.1. Properties\r
From the ∼ 300 observed cycles above 20 Hz, we\r
are able to tightly constrain the source properties of\r
GW190814. Our analysis shows that GW190814’s\r
source is a binary with an unequal mass ratio q =\r
0.112+0.008\r
−0.009, with individual source masses m1 =\r
23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f and m2 = 2.59+0.08−0.09 M\f, as shown in\r
Figure 3. A summary of the inferred source prop\u0002erties is given in Table 1. We assume a standard\r
flat ΛCDM cosmology with Hubble constant H0 =\r
67.9 km s−1 Mpc−1(Ade et al. 2016).\r
We report detailed results obtained from the two pre\u0002cessing BBH signal models including subdominant mul\u0002tipole moments: Phenom PHM and EOBNR PHM. In\r
order to compare the template models, we compute their\r
Bayes factor (log10 B). We find no significant evidence\r
that one waveform family is preferred over the other as\r
the Bayes factor between Phenom PHM and EOBNR\r
PHM is log10 B ' 1.0. As a result, we combine the\r
posterior samples with equal weight, in effect marginal\u0002izing over a discrete set of signal models with a uniform\r
probability. This is shown in the last column of Table 1,\r
and we refer to these values throughout the paper unless\r
stated otherwise.\r
We find that the secondary mass lies in the\r
range 2.50– 2.67 M\f. This inferred secondary mass\r
exceeds the bounds of the primary component in\r
GW190425 (1.61–2.52 M\f; Abbott et al. 2020a) and the\r
most massive known pulsar in the Galaxy: 2.14+0.10\r
−0.09 M\f\r
at 68.3% credible interval (Cromartie et al. 2019). Fur\u0002thermore, the secondary is more massive than bounds\r
on the maximum NS mass from studies of the rem\u0002nant of GW170817, and from theoretical (Abbott et al.\r
1\r
In the co-precessing frame the EOBNR model in\u0002cludes the (l, m) = (2, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±3), (4, ±4) and\r
(5, ±5) multipoles, and the Phenom model includes the\r
(2, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±3), (3, ±2), (4, ±4) and (4, ±3) multipoles.\r
2018) and observational estimates (Farr & Chatziioan\u0002nou 2020). The inferred secondary mass is comparable\r
to the putative BH remnant mass of GW170817 (Abbott\r
et al. 2019b).\r
The primary object is identified as a BH based on its\r
measured mass of 23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f. Due to accurately ob\u0002serving the frequency evolution over a long inspiral, the\r
chirp mass is well constrained to 6.09+0.06\r
−0.06 M\f. The in\u0002ferred mass ratio q = 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009 makes GW190814 only\r
the second gravitational-wave observation with a signif\u0002icantly unequal mass ratio (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2020d).\r
Given that this system is in a region of the parame\u0002ter space that has not been explored via gravitational\u0002wave emission previously, we test possible waveform sys\u0002tematics by comparing the Phenom and EOB waveform\r
families. Differences in the inferred secondary mass are\r
shown in Figure 4. The results indicate that the inferred\r
secondary mass is robust to possible waveform system\u0002atics, with good agreement between the Phenom PHM\r
and EOBNR PHM signal models. Signal models that\r
exclude higher multipoles or precession do not constrain\r
the secondary mass as well.\r
The time delay of a signal across a network of gravi\u0002tational wave detectors, together with the relative am\u0002plitude and phase at each detector, allows us to mea\u0002sure the location of the GW source on the sky (Abbott\r
et al. 2020b). We localize GW190814’s source to within\r
18.5 deg2at 90% probability, as shown in Figure 2. This\r
is comparable to the localization of GW170817 (Abbott\r
et al. 2017a, 2019a).\r
Spins are a fundamental property of BHs. Their mag\u0002nitude and orientation carry information regarding the\r
evolution history of the binary. The effective inspiral\r
spin parameter χeff (Damour 2001; Racine 2008; Ajith\r
et al. 2011; Santamar´ıa et al. 2010) contains informa\u0002tion about the spin components that are perpendicular\r
to the orbital plane. We infer that χeff = −0.002+0.060\r
−0.061.\r
The tight constraints are consistent with being able to\r
measure the phase evolution from the long inspiral.\r
Orbital precession occurs when there is a significant\r
spin component in the orbital plane of the binary (Apos\u0002tolatos et al. 1994). We parameterize precession by the\r
effective precession spin parameter 0 ≤ χp ≤ 1 (Schmidt\r
et al. 2015). This effect is difficult to measure for face-on\r
and face-off systems (Apostolatos et al. 1994; Buonanno\r
et al. 2003; Vitale et al. 2014, 2017; Fairhurst et al.\r
2019a,b). GW190814 constrains the inclination of the\r
binary to be Θ = 0.8\r
+0.3\r
−0.2\r
rad. Since the system is nei\u0002ther face-on nor face-off, we are able to put strong con\u0002straints on the precession of the system: χp = 0.04+0.04\r
−0.03.\r
This is both the strongest constraint on the amount of\r
precession for any gravitational-wave detection to date,

The right panel compares m2 to predictions for the maxi\u0002mum NS mass, Mmax (see Section 6). The posterior distri\u0002bution for Mmax from the spectral equation of state analysis\r
of GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2018) is shown in orange, and\r
the empirical Mmax distribution from the population model\r
of Farr & Chatziioannou (2020) is shown in green. The grey\r
dashed line and shading represent the measured mass of the\r
heaviest pulsar in the Galaxy (median and 68% confidence in\u0002terval; Cromartie et al. 2019). The solid grey band at 2.3 M\f\r
is the upper bound on Mmax from studies of GW170817’s\r
merger remnant.\r
and the first gravitational-wave measurement which con\u0002clusively measures near-zero precession (Abbott et al.\r
2019a, 2020a,d).\r
By computing the Bayes factor between a precessing\r
and non-precessing signal model (log10B ∼ 0.5 in favor\r
of precession), we find inconclusive evidence for in-plane\r
spin. This is consistent with the inferred power from\r
precession SNR ρp (Fairhurst et al. 2019a,b), whose re\u0002covered distribution resembles that expected in the ab\u0002sence of any precession in the signal; see Figure 5. The\r
ρp calculation assumes a signal dominated by the ` = 2\r
mode; however, we have verified that the contribution of\r
higher harmonics to the measurement of spin precession\r
is subdominant by a factor of 5. The data are therefore\r
consistent with the signal from a non-precessing system.\r

secondary mass obtained using a suite of waveform mod\u0002els. The vertical lines indicate the 90% credible bounds\r
for each waveform model. The labels Phenom/EOBNR\r
PHM (generic spin directions + higher multipoles), Phe\u0002nom/EOBNR HM (aligned-spin + higher multipoles) and\r
Phenom/EOBNR (aligned-spin, quadrupole only) indicate\r
the different physical content in each of the waveform mod\u0002els.\r
Figure 4 shows that signal models including spin\u0002precession effects give tighter constraints on the sec\u0002ondary mass compared to their non-precessing equiva\u0002lents. Signal models that include spin-precession effects\r
can constrain χp, whereas non-precessing signal mod\u0002els cannot provide information on in-plane spin com\u0002ponents. In all analyses, we assume a prior equivalent\r
to spin orientations being isotropically distributed. We\r
find that the data are inconsistent with large χp and\r
consistent with any secondary spin. Therefore, for pre\u0002cessing signal models the allowed q–χeff parameter space\r
is restricted, which helps to break the degeneracy (Pois\u0002son & Will 1995; Baird et al. 2013; Farr et al. 2016;\r
Baird et al. 2013; Ng et al. 2018). Consequently, the\r
extra information from constraining χp to small values\r
enables a more precise measurement of the secondary\r
mass.\r
The asymmetry in the masses of GW190814 means\r
that the spin of the more massive object dominates con\u0002tributions to χeff and χp. As both χeff and χp are tightly\r
constrained, we are able to bound the primary spin of\r
GW190814 to be χ1 ≤ 0.07, as shown in Figure 6. This\r
is the strongest constraint on the primary spin for any\r
gravitational-wave event to date (Abbott et al. 2019a,\r
2020a,d).\r
The joint posterior probability of the magnitude and\r
orientation of χ1 and χ2 are shown in Figure 6. De\u0002viations from uniform shading indicate a spin property\r
measurement. The primary spin is tightly constrained\r
to small magnitudes, but its orientation is indistinguish-

able from the prior distribution. The spin of the less\r
massive object, χ2, remains unconstrained; the poste\u0002rior distribution is broadly consistent with the prior.\r
The final mass Mf and final dimensionless spin χf of\r
the merger remnant are estimated under the assump\u0002tion that the secondary is a BH. By averaging several\r
fits calibrated to numerical relativity (Hofmann et al.\r
2016; Johnson-McDaniel et al. 2016; Healy & Lousto\r
2017; Jim´enez-Forteza et al. 2017), we infer the final\r
mass and spin of the remnant BH to be 25.6\r
+1.1\r
−0.9 M\f and\r
0.28+0.02\r
−0.02, respectively. The final spin is lower than for\r
previous mergers (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2020d), as ex\u0002pected from the low primary spin and smaller orbital\r
contribution due to the asymmetric masses.\r
4.2. Evidence for Higher-order Multipoles\r
The relative importance of a subdominant multipole\r
moment increases with mass ratio. Each subdominant\r
multipole moment has a different angular dependence\r
on the emission direction. With significant evidence\r
for multipoles other than the dominant (`, m) = (2, 2)\r
quadrupole, we gain an independent measurement of the\r
inclination of the source. This allows for the distance\u0002inclination degeneracy to be broken (Cutler & Flanagan\r
1994; Abbott et al. 2016f; Usman et al. 2019; Kalaghatgi\r
et al. 2020). Measuring higher-order multipoles there\u0002fore gives more precise measurements of source parame\u0002ters (Van Den Broeck & Sengupta 2007a,b; Kidder 2008;\r
Blanchet et al. 2008; Mishra et al. 2016; Kumar et al.\r
2019).\r
GW190412 was the first event where there was sig\u0002nificant evidence for higher-order multipoles (Payne\r
et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
GW190814 exhibits stronger evidence for higher-order\r
multipoles, with log10 B ' 9.6 in favor of a higher\u00020\r

multipole vs. a pure quadrupole model. The (`, m) =\r
(3, 3) is the strongest subdominant multipole, with\r
log10 B ' 9.1 in favor of a signal model including\r
both the (`, m) = (2, 2) and (3, 3) multipole moments.\r
GW190814’s stronger evidence for higher multipoles is\r
expected given its more asymmetric masses and the\r
larger network SNR.\r
The orthogonal optimal SNR of a subdominant mul\u0002tipole is calculated by decomposing each multipole into\r
components parallel and perpendicular to the domi\u0002nant harmonic (Mills & Fairhurst 2020; Abbott et al.\r
2020d). We infer that the orthogonal optimal SNR of\r
the (`, m) = (3, 3) multipole is 6.6\r
+1.3\r
−1.4\r
, as shown in Fig\u0002ure 5. This is the strongest evidence for measuring a\r
subdominant multipole to date (Payne et al. 2019; Ku\u0002mar et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
Finally, we perform two complementary analyses in\u0002volving time–frequency tracks in the data to provide fur\u0002ther evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the\r
signal. In the first approach (also outlined in Abbott\r
et al. 2020d, Section 4) we predict the time–frequency

of α = 1.5 for the m = 3 mode.\r
track of the dominant (2, 2) multipole in the LIGO Liv\u0002ingston detector (as seen in Figure 1, middle panel) from\r
an EOBNR HM parameter estimation analysis. This\r
analysis collects energies along a time–frequency track\r
which is α × f22(t), the (2, 2) multipole’s instantaneous\r
frequency, where α is a dimensionless parameter (Roy\r
et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d). We find prominent\r
peaks in Y (α), the energy in the pixels along the α-th\r
track defined in Abbott et al. (2020d), at α = 1 and 1.5,\r
as can be seen from the on-source curve in the top panel\r
of Figure 7. These peaks correspond to the m = 2 and\r
m = 3 multipole predictions in the data containing the\r
signal (on-source data). We also compute a detection\r
statistic β (Roy et al. 2019) of 10.09 for the presence of\r
the m = 3 multipole with a p-value of < 2.5 × 10−4,\r
compared to a background distribution estimated over\r
18 hours of data adjacent to the event (off-source data),\r
where the largest background β is 7.59. The signifi\u0002cant difference between on- and off-source values pro\u0002vides much stronger evidence for the presence of higher\r
multipoles than what is reported for GW190412 (Abbott\r
et al. 2020d).\r
The second analysis uses waveform-agnostic methods\r
to reconstruct the signal. It then compares the ob\u0002served coherent signal energy in the LIGO Hanford–\r
LIGO Livingston–Virgo network of detectors, as iden\u0002tified by the cWB detection pipeline (Klimenko et al.\r
2016), with the predictions of a waveform model with\u0002out higher multipoles (EOBNR; Prodi et al. 2020) to\r
investigate if the description of the underlying signal is\r
incomplete if we do not include contributions from the\r
m = 3 multipole in our waveform model. We compute a\r
test statistic, the squared sum of the coherent residuals\r
estimated over selected time–frequency tracks parame\u0002terized in terms of the same α parameter defined in the\r
previous analysis (Roy et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
Each time–frequency track centered on α includes fre\u0002quencies within [α − 0.1, α + 0.1] × f22(t), and times\r
within [tmerger − 0.5 s, tmerger − 0.03 s], where f22(t) and\r
tmerger correspond to the maximum likelihood template\r
from the EOBNR parameter estimation analysis. We\r
further compute a background distribution using simu\u0002lated signals in off-source data (Prodi et al. 2020), and\r
compute p-values for the on-source results as a func\u0002tion of α (Figure 7, bottom panel). We find a minimum\r
p–value of 6.8 × 10−3 at α = 1.5, providing strong ev\u0002idence that the disagreement between the actual event\r
and the EOBNR prediction is because of the absence\r
of the m = 3 multipoles in the waveform model. The\r
local minimum near α = 2 is not an indication of the\r
m = 4 multipoles, but rather a statistical fluctuation\r
which is consistent with similar behaviour seen for stud\u0002ies with simulated signals described in detail in Prodi\r
et al. (2020).\r
Although the two time–frequency analyses are simi\u0002lar in motivation, the latter differs from the former in\r
that it is not restricted to data from just one detector,\r
but rather uses the coherent signal energy across the\r
three-detector network. Both analyses point to strong\r
evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the sig\u0002nal.\r
5. TESTS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY\r
GW190814 is the gravitational-wave event with the\r
most unequal mass ratio to date, and can therefore be\r
used to test general relativity (GR) in a region of pa\u0002rameter space previously unexplored with strong-field\r
tests of GR (Abbott et al. 2016g, 2019e,d). The asym\u0002metric nature of a system excites the higher multipole\r
moments of the gravitational signal, which allows us to\r
test the multipolar structure of gravity (Kastha et al.\r
2018, 2019; Dhanpal et al. 2019; Islam et al. 2020). The\r
addition of information from the higher harmonics of a\r
signal also breaks certain degeneracies in the description

10\r
of the source, and could potentially enable us to place\r
stronger constraints on certain deviations from GR (Van\r
Den Broeck & Sengupta 2007b,a). We perform sev\u0002eral null tests of GR using GW190814. These tests as\u0002sume GW190814 is a (quasi-circular) BBH merger as de\u0002scribed in GR, and look for inconsistencies between the\r
observed signal and predictions of the theory. An incon\u0002sistency might arise from an incomplete understanding\r
of the underlying signal (or noise), and could indicate a\r
non-BBH nature of the signal or a potential departure\r
from GR.\r
First, as a consistency test of the signal reconstruc\u0002tion, we subtract from the data the maximum like\u0002lihood compact binary coalescence waveforms, Phe\u0002nom (Khan et al. 2016), Phenom HM (Kalaghatgi\r
et al. 2020), Phenom PHM (Khan et al. 2020), and\r
EOBNR PHM (Ossokine et al. 2020) and analyze 4 s\r
of the resulting residual data centered around the time\r
of merger with the morphology-independent transient\r
analysis BayesWave (Cornish & Littenberg 2015; Lit\u0002tenberg & Cornish 2015). We measure the 90% credible\r
upper limit on the coherent SNR, ρ90, and compare it\r
to the SNR, ρ\r
N\r
90, recovered by analyzing 175 randomly\r
selected data segments in surrounding time (off–source\r
data) with the same configuration settings. If the resid\u0002ual data are consistent with the noise, we expect ρ90\r
to be consistent with ρ\r
N\r
90. We compute the p-value\r
by comparing the distribution of ρ\r
N\r
90 to ρ90 through\r
p = P(ρ\r
N\r
90 < ρ90). We obtain p-values of 0.59, 0.82,\r
0.82, and 0.75 for Phenom, Phenom HM, Phenom PHM,\r
and EOBNR PHM, respectively. Hence, we find no evi\u0002dence for deviations in the behavior of the residual data\r
stream.\r
We also look for deviations in the spin-induced\r
quadrupole moments of the binary components. Accord\u0002ing to the no-hair conjecture (Carter 1971; Hansen 1974)\r
the multipole moments of a Kerr BH are completely\r
described by its mass and spin angular momentum.\r
At leading order in spin, the spin-induced quadrupole\r
moment scalar is (Hartle 1967; Pappas & Apostolatos\r
2012), Q = −κa2m3, where (m, a) are the mass and\r
dimensionless spin of the compact object, and κ is a\r
dimensionless deformation parameter characterizing de\u0002viations in the spin-induced quadrupole moment. Kerr\r
BHs have κ = 1 (Thorne 1980), while κ ∼ 2–14 for NSs\r
(depending on the equation of state) and κ ∼ 10–150\r
for spinning boson stars with large self-interaction (Ryan\r
1997). The deformation parameter can even be negative\r
for (slowly-rotating, thin-shelled) gravastars (Uchikata\r
et al. 2016). Hence, an accurate measurement of κ\r
sheds light onto the nature of the compact object. For\r
compact binaries, the spin-induced quadrupole moment\r
terms appear at second post-Newtonian order (Poisson\r
1998). For Kerr BHs in GR, κ1 = κ2 = 1, where\r
κ1, κ2 are the individual deformation parameters of the\r
primary and secondary compact objects in the binary.\r
Since κ1 and κ2 are strongly degenerate in the gravita\u0002tional waveform, we instead measure a linear symmetric\r
combination of these quantities, κs = (κ1+κ2)/2, which\r
is 1 for a BBH in GR. The posteriors on κs are rela\u0002tively uninformative, and nearly span the prior range\r
of [0, 500], with increased support at κs = 0 relative to\r
the prior. The upper bound of the prior was chosen to\r
accommodate all the objects listed above. The result\r
shows that GW190814 is consistent with having a BBH\r
source described by GR. However, the broad posterior\r
means that we cannot exclude the possibility that one\r
or both components of the source is not a BH. We can\r
attempt to understand this result in terms of the spin\r
measurements for the binary. The measurements of κs\r
and a non-zero χeff are highly correlated (Krishnendu\r
et al. 2019), and for a system with small χeff the bounds\r
on the measured value of κs are weak.\r
Finally, we investigate the source dynamics of the\r
binary through a parameterized test of gravitational\r
waveform generation, where we allow for the coeffi\u0002cients describing the post-Newtonian inspiral of a BBH\r
coalescence to deviate away from their predictions in\r
GR (Arun et al. 2006a,b; Yunes & Pretorius 2009;\r
Mishra et al. 2010; Cornish et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012;\r
Meidam et al. 2018). We use an aligned-spin EOB wave\u0002form without higher modes (EOBNR), and find no de\u0002viations in the post-Newtonian coefficients from their\r
nominal values in GR. In summary, none of our tests of\r
GR indicate any departure from the predictions of the\r
theory, and GW190814 is consistent with the description\r
of a compact binary merger in GR.\r
6. ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS\r
The highly unequal mass ratio of 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009 and un\u0002usual secondary mass of 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f make the source\r
of GW190814 unlike any other compact binary coales\u0002cence observed so far. The average mass ratio for BBH\r
coalescences detected by the LVC during O1 and O2 is\r
' 0.9 (Roulet & Zaldarriaga 2019), and an inference\r
of the underlying population predicted that 99% of de\u0002tectable BBHs have mass ratios q ≥ 0.5 (Fishbach &\r
Holz 2020). However, the paucity of events from O1\r
and O2 means that this picture is limited. Indeed, the\r
discovery of GW190412 has already changed the picture\r
substantially (Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
GW190814’s secondary mass lies in the hypothesized\r
lower mass gap of 2.5–5 M\f (Bailyn et al. 1998; Ozel ¨\r
et al. 2010; Farr et al. 2011; Ozel et al. ¨ 2012) between

11\r
known NSs and BHs. It is heavier than the most mas\u0002sive pulsar in the Galaxy (Cromartie et al. 2019), and al\u0002most certainly exceeds the mass of the 1.61–2.52 M\f pri\u0002mary component of GW190425, which is itself an out\u0002lier relative to the Galactic population of BNSs (Abbott\r
et al. 2020a). On the other hand, it is comparable in\r
mass to two BH candidates: the ' 2.7 M\f merger rem\u0002nant of GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2019b) and the 2.6–\r
6.1 M\f compact object (95% confidence interval) dis\u0002covered by Thompson et al. (2019).2\r
It is also compara\u0002ble to the millisecond pulsar PSR J1748−2021B (Freire\r
et al. 2008), whose mass is claimed as 2.74+0.21\r
−0.21M\f at\r
68% confidence. However, this estimate, obtained via\r
measurement of the periastron advance, could be inac\u0002curate if the system inclination is low or the pulsar’s\r
companion is rapidly rotating (Freire et al. 2008). In\r
sum, it is not clear if GW190814’s secondary is a BH or\r
a NS.\r
GW190814 poses a challenge for our understanding of\r
the population of merging compact binaries. In what\r
follows, we estimate the merger rate density of the com\u0002pact binary subpopulation represented by this source,\r
investigate the nature of its secondary component and\r
possible implications for the NS equation of state, dis\u0002cuss how the system may have formed, and study its\r
implications for cosmology.\r
6.1. Merger Rate Density\r
Given the unprecedented combination of component\r
masses found in GW190814, we take the system to rep\u0002resent a new class of compact binary mergers, and use\r
our analysis of its source properties to estimate a merger\r
rate density for GW190814-like events. Following a\r
method described in Kim et al. (2003), we calculate\r
a simple, single-event rate density estimate R accord\u0002ing to our sensitivity to a population of systems drawn\r
from the parameter-estimation posteriors. As in Ab\u0002bott et al. (2020a), we calculate our surveyed space\u0002time volume hV Ti semi-analytically, imposing single\u0002detector and network SNR thresholds of 5 and 10, re\u0002spectively (Tiwari 2018). The semi-analytic hV Ti for\r
GW190814 is then multiplied by a calibration factor to\r
match results from the search pipelines assuming a once\u0002per-century FAR threshold. The sensitivity of a search\r
pipeline is estimated using a set of simulated signals.\r
For computational efficiency, this was done using pre\u0002existing search pipeline simulations and the mass prop\u0002erties were not highly optimized. However, given that\r
we are estimating a rate based on a single source, the cal\u00022 See van den Heuvel & Tauris (2020) and Thompson et al. (2020)\r
for discussion about the interpretation of this observation.\r
ibration errors are much smaller than the statistical er\u0002rors associated with the estimate. The simulated sources\r
were uniformly distributed in comoving volume, compo\u0002nent masses, and component spins aligned with the or\u0002bital angular momentum. For O1 and O2, the simulated\r
BH mass range was 5–100 M\f, but for the first part of\r
O3 we are analyzing here, the injected range was 2.5–\r
40 M\f (following our updated knowledge of the BH mass\r
distribution); the NS mass range was 1–3 M\f, and com\u0002ponent spins are < 0.95. As GW190814 occurred when\r
LIGO Hanford was not in nominal observing mode, it is\r
not included in the production PyCBC results, and we\r
use GstLAL results to calculate the merger rate.\r
We assume a Poisson likelihood over the astrophysical\r
rate with a single count and we apply a Jeffreys R−1/2\r
prior to obtain rate posteriors. The analysis was done\r
using samples from the Phenom PHM posterior and sep\u0002arately from the EOBNR PHM posterior, producing the\r
same result in both cases. We find the merger rate den\u0002sity of GW190814-like systems to be 7+16\r
−6 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
.\r
As a consistency check, we used the PyCBC search\r
results to calculate an upper limit. Repeating the rate\r
calculation with a PyCBC-based hV Ti calibration and\r
zero event count, we obtain an upper limit consistent\r
(to within 10%) with the upper limit of the merger rate\r
estimated using GstLAL search results. We conclude\r
that the uncertainty in our estimate of the rate density\r
for the class of mergers represented by GW190814 is\r
primarily dominated by Poisson statistics.\r
6.2. Nature of the Secondary Component\r
The primary mass measurement of 23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f se\u0002curely identifies the heavier component of GW190814 as\r
a BH, but the secondary mass of 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f may be\r
compatible with either a NS or a BH depending on the\r
maximum mass supported by the unknown NS equa\u0002tion of state (EOS). The source’s asymmetric masses,\r
the non-detection of an electromagnetic counterpart and\r
the lack of a clear signature of tides or spin-induced\r
quadrupole effects in the waveform do not allow us to\r
distinguish between a BBH or a NSBH. Instead, we rely\r
on comparisons between m2 and different estimates of\r
the maximum NS mass, Mmax, to indicate the source\r
classification preferred by data: if m2 > Mmax, then the\r
NSBH scenario is untenable.\r
While some candidate EOSs from nuclear theory can\r
support nonrotating NSs with masses of up to ∼ 3 M\f\r
(e.g., M¨uller & Serot 1996), such large values of Mmax\r
are disfavored by the relatively small tidal deforma\u0002bilities measured in GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2017a,\r
2019b), which correlate with smaller internal pressure\r
gradients as a function of density and hence a lower

12\r
threshold for gravitational collapse. By adopting a phe\u0002nomenological model for the EOS, conditioning it on\r
GW170817, and extrapolating the constraints to the\r
high densities relevant for the maximum mass, Lim &\r
Holt (2019) and Essick et al. (2020) place Mmax .\r
2.3 M\f. Similarly, the EOS inference reported in Abbott\r
et al. (2018), based on an analysis of GW170817 with\r
a spectral parameterization (Lindblom 2010; Lindblom\r
& Indik 2012, 2014) for the EOS, implies a 90% credi\u0002ble upper bound of Mmax ≤ 2.43 M\f, with tenuous but\r
non-zero posterior support beyond 2.6 M\f. We calculate\r
the corresponding Mmax posterior distribution, shown\r
in the right panel of Figure 3, from the GW170817-\r
informed spectral EOS samples used in Abbott et al.\r
(2018) by reconstructing each EOS from its parameters\r
and computing its maximum mass. Comparison with\r
the m2 posterior suggests that the secondary component\r
of GW190814 is probably more massive than this predic\u0002tion for Mmax: the posterior probability of m2 ≤ Mmax,\r
marginalized over the uncertainty in m2 and Mmax, is\r
only 3%. Nevertheless, the maximum mass predictions\r
from these kinds of EOS inferences come with impor\u0002tant caveats: their extrapolations are sensitive to the\r
phenomenological model assumed for the EOS; they use\r
hard Mmax thresholds on the EOS prior to account for\r
the existence of the heaviest Galactic pulsars, which is\r
known to bias the inferred maximum mass distribution\r
towards the threshold (Miller et al. 2020); and they pre\u0002date the NICER observatory’s recent simultaneous mass\r
and radius measurement for J0030+0451, which may in\u0002crease the Mmax estimates by a few percent (Landry\r
et al. 2020) because it favors slightly stiffer EOSs than\r
GW170817 (Raaijmakers et al. 2019; Riley et al. 2019;\r
Miller et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2020).\r
NS mass measurements also inform bounds on Mmax\r
independently of EOS assumptions. Fitting the known\r
population of NSs in binaries to a double-Gaussian mass\r
distribution with a high-mass cutoff, Alsing et al. (2018)\r
obtained an empirical constraint of Mmax ≤ 2.6 M\f\r
(one-sided 90% confidence interval). Farr & Chatzi\u0002ioannou (2020) recently updated this analysis to in\u0002clude PSR J0740+6620 (Cromartie et al. 2019), which\r
had not been discovered at the time of the original\r
study. Based on samples from the Farr & Chatzi\u0002ioannou (2020) maximum-mass posterior distribution,\r
which is plotted in the right panel of Figure 3, we\r
find Mmax = 2.25+0.81\r
−0.26 M\f. In this case, the posterior\r
probability of m2 ≤ Mmax is 29%, again favoring the\r
m2 > Mmax scenario, albeit less strongly because of the\r
distribution’s long tail up to ∼ 3 M\f. However, the em\u0002pirical Mmax prediction is sensitive to selection effects\r
that could potentially bias it (Alsing et al. 2018). In\r
particular, masses are only measurable for binary pul\u0002sars, and the mass distribution of isolated NSs could be\r
different. Additionally, the discovery of GW190425 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2020a) should also be taken into account in\r
the population when predicting Mmax.\r
Finally, the NS maximum mass is constrained by stud\u0002ies of the merger remnant of GW170817. Although no\r
postmerger gravitational waves were observed (Abbott\r
et al. 2017g, 2019f), modeling of the associated kilonova\r
(Abbott et al. 2017b; Kasen et al. 2017; Villar et al. 2017;\r
Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Abbott et al. 2017d) sug\u0002gests that the merger remnant collapsed to a BH after\r
a brief supramassive or hypermassive NS phase during\r
which it was stabilized by uniform or differential rota\u0002tion. Assuming this ultimate fate for the merger rem\u0002nant immediately implies that no NS can be stable above\r
∼ 2.7 M\f, but it places a more stringent constraint on\r
NSs that are not rotationally supported. The precise\r
mapping from the collapse threshold mass of the rem\u0002nant to Mmax depends on the EOS, but by developing\r
approximate prescriptions based on sequences of rapidly\r
rotating stars for a range of candidate EOSs, Mmax has\r
been bounded below approximately 2.2–2.3 M\f (Mar\u0002galit & Metzger 2017; Rezzolla et al. 2018; Ruiz et al.\r
2018; Shibata et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020c). Although\r
the degree of EOS uncertainty in these results is difficult\r
to quantify precisely, if we take the more conservative\r
2.3 M\f bound at face value, then m2 is almost certainly\r
not a NS: the m2 posterior distribution has negligible\r
support below 2.3 M\f.\r
Overall, these considerations suggest that GW190814\r
is probably not the product of a NSBH coalescence, de\u0002spite its preliminary classification as such. Nonetheless,\r
the possibility that the secondary component is a NS\r
cannot be completely discounted due to the current un\u0002certainty in Mmax.\r
There are two further caveats to this assessment.\r
First, because the secondary’s spin is unconstrained, it\r
could conceivably be rotating rapidly enough for m2\r
to exceed Mmax without triggering gravitational col\u0002lapse: rapid uniform rotation can stabilize a star up\r
to ∼ 20% more massive than the nonrotating maximum\r
mass (Cook et al. 1994), in which case only the absolute\r
upper bound of ∼ 2.7 M\f is relevant. However, it is very\r
unlikely that a NSBH system could merge before dissi\u0002pating such extreme natal NS spin angular momentum.\r
Second, our discussion has thus far neglected the pos\u0002sibility that the secondary component is an exotic com\u0002pact object, such as a boson star (Kaup 1968) or a\r
gravastar (Mazur & Mottola 2004), instead of a NS or a\r
BH. Depending on the model, some exotic compact ob\u0002jects can potentially support masses up to and beyond

Figure 8. Constraints on the NS EOS assuming GW190814\r
was produced by a BBH (blue) or a NSBH (orange) coales\u0002cence. The 90% and 50% credible contours of the posterior\r
in the pressure-density plane are shown. The constraints\r
are calculated by assuming a spectral decomposition for the\r
EOS, following Abbott et al. (2018). The BBH constraints\r
are identical to those from the analysis of GW170817, while\r
for the NSBH case the posterior is reweighted by the prob\u0002ability that each EOS’s maximum mass is at least m2. The\r
dashed lines indicate the 90% credible region of the prior.\r
2.6 M\f (Cardoso & Pani 2019). Our analysis does not\r
exclude this hypothesis for the secondary.\r
Since the NSBH scenario cannot be definitively ruled\r
out, we examine GW190814’s potential implications for\r
the NS EOS, assuming that the secondary proves to be\r
a NS. This would require Mmax to be no less than m2,\r
a condition that severely constrains the distribution of\r
EOSs compatible with existing astrophysical data. The\r
combined constraints on the EOS from GW170817 and\r
this hypothetical maximum mass information are shown\r
in Figure 8. Specifically, we have taken the spectral\r
EOS distribution conditioned on GW170817 from Ab\u0002bott et al. (2018) and reweighted each EOS by the prob\u0002ability that its maximum mass is at least as large as m2.\r
The updated posterior favors stiffer EOSs, which trans\u0002lates to larger radii for NSs of a given mass. The cor\u0002responding constraints on the radius and tidal deforma\u0002bility of a canonical 1.4 M\f NS are R1.4 = 12.9\r
+0.8\r
−0.7\r
km\r
and Λ1.4 = 616+273\r
−158.\r
6.3. Origins of GW190814-like Systems\r
The source of GW190814 represents a previously un\u0002detected class of coalescences that has the potential to\r
shed light on the formation of merging compact-object\r
binaries with highly asymmetric masses.\r
Electromagnetic observations of Galactic NSs and\r
stellar-mass BHs suggest a dearth of compact objects in\r
the ∼ 2.5 M\f to 5 M\f range (Bailyn et al. 1998; Ozel ¨\r
et al. 2010; Farr et al. 2011; Ozel et al. ¨ 2012). Observa\u0002tions of a few candidates with masses in this range seem\r
to disfavor the existence of a gap (Freire et al. 2008;\r
Neustroev et al. 2014; Giesers et al. 2018; Wyrzykowski\r
& Mandel 2020; Thompson et al. 2019), but whether the\r
mass gap is physical or caused by selection biases is still\r
a matter of debate (e.g., Kreidberg et al. 2012).\r
From a theoretical point of view, accurately calculat\u0002ing the masses of compact remnants at formation is chal\u0002lenging, because it depends on the complex physics of\r
the supernova explosion and the details of stellar evolu\u0002tion, especially for the late evolutionary stages of mas\u0002sive stars (Janka 2012; M¨uller 2016; Burrows et al. 2018;\r
Burrows et al. 2019). Whether the models favor the\r
presence of a gap or a smooth transition between NSs\r
and BHs is still unclear, and in fact some models have\r
been developed with the purpose of reproducing this\r
lower mass gap (Ugliano et al. 2012; Fryer et al. 2012;\r
Kochanek 2014; Sukhbold & Woosley 2014; Ertl et al.\r
2016). Therefore, our robust discovery of an object with\r
a well-constrained mass in this regime may provide cru\u0002cial constraints on compact-object formation models. In\r
fact, GW190814 demonstrates the need to adjust rem\u0002nant mass prescriptions previously designed to produce\r
a perceived mass gap. The combination of mass ratio\r
and component masses challenges most results obtained\r
from population synthesis simulations for isolated bina\u0002ries (Dominik et al. 2012, 2015; Marchant et al. 2017;\r
Giacobbo & Mapelli 2018; Mapelli & Giacobbo 2018;\r
Kruckow et al. 2018; Neijssel et al. 2019; Mapelli et al.\r
2019; Spera et al. 2019; Olejak et al. 2020) .\r
Population synthesis models distinguish between NSs\r
and BHs using only a mass threshold, which is gen\u0002erally in the range 2–3 M\f. Thus, depending on the\r
adopted threshold and on the adopted supernova explo\u0002sion model, a GW190814-like event may be labeled as\r
either a NSBH merger or a BBH merger. Most BBH\r
mergers have q > 0.5, while the distributions of merging\r
NSBH binaries suggest that systems with q . 0.1 may\r
be up to ∼ 103times less common than more symmet\u0002ric ones (q > 0.1) and that the mass-ratio distribution\r
peaks at q ≈ 0.2. Furthermore, models tend to favor\r
mergers of massive (& 1.3 M\f) NSs with relatively small\r
BHs (. 15 M\f) in environments with sub-solar metal\u0002licity (Z . 0.5Z\f). The tendency to disfavor mergers\r
with highly asymmetric masses in isolated binaries may\r
be the consequence of mass transfer (e.g., Postnov &\r
Yungelson 2014) and common envelope episodes (e.g.,\r
Ivanova et al. 2013) that cause systems with initially\r
asymmetric masses to evolve towards more symmetric\r
configurations. Overall, producing mergers with such\r
unequal masses, with a secondary in the perceived mass

14\r
gap, and at the rate implied by this discovery is a chal\u0002lenge for current models.\r
Nevertheless, particular choices of poorly constrained\r
assumptions within rapid population synthesis models\r
may increase the number of mergers with q . 0.1 so\r
that the latter may be only a few times less common\r
than (or even comparable to) systems with q ' 0.2 (e.g.,\r
Eldridge & Stanway 2016; Eldridge et al. 2017; Giacobbo\r
& Mapelli 2018).\r
Another possibility is that GW190814 is of dynami\u0002cal origin. Dynamical exchanges in dense stellar envi\u0002ronments tend to pair up massive compact objects with\r
similar masses (e.g., Sigurdsson & Hernquist 1993). This\r
process is effective for globular clusters, where compact\u0002object binaries may undergo tens of exchanges before\r
they get ejected from the cluster (Portegies Zwart &\r
McMillan 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2016; Park et al. 2017;\r
Askar et al. 2017; Rodriguez et al. 2019). For such envi\u0002ronments, models predict that most merging BBHs have\r
q ' 1 (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2016), and the formation\r
of NSBH binaries is highly suppressed because BHs dy\u0002namically dominate the cores over the complete lifetime\r
of the clusters, preventing the interactions between BHs\r
and NSs, with the consequence that the merger rate of\r
NSBH binaries in globular clusters in the local Universe\r
is ∼ 10−2–10−1 Gpc−3yr−1(Clausen et al. 2013; Ye et al.\r
2020; Arca Sedda 2020). The rate for GW190814-like\r
events, with a secondary in the perceived mass gap, is\r
likely even lower. In contrast, the NSBH merger rate\r
may be significantly higher in young star clusters (e.g.,\r
Ziosi et al. 2014) and the latter can effectively increase\r
the number of progenitors leading to merging compact\u0002object binaries with q . 0.15 (Di Carlo et al. 2019;\r
Rastello et al. 2020). Thus, young star clusters may\r
be promising hosts for GW190814-like events, but the\r
parameter space relevant for GW190814 is mostly unex\u0002plored in the context of star clusters.\r
In dense stellar environments, GW190814-like sys\u0002tems may also form from a low-mass merger remnant\r
that acquires a BH companion via dynamical interac\u0002tions (Gupta et al. 2020). Gupta et al. (2020) pre\u0002dicts a population of second-generation BHs in the 2.2–\r
3.8 M\f range, with a peak in the distribution at 2.6 M\f,\r
assuming a double-Gaussian mass distribution for the\r
NSs. However, recent dynamical simulations of globular\r
clusters (e.g., Ye et al. 2020) find the subsequent merger\r
of such a second-generation BH with a larger stellar\u0002mass BH to be exceedingly rare. A high component spin\r
could be a distinguishing feature of a second-generation\r
compact object, but the uninformative spin posterior\r
for the lighter component of GW190814 provides no ev\u0002idence for or against this hypothesis.\r
A GW190814-like merger may also have originated\r
from a hierarchical triple in the field (e.g., Silsbee &\r
Tremaine 2017; Fragione & Loeb 2019; Antonini et al.\r
2017), from a wide hierarchical quadruple system (Sa\u0002farzadeh et al. 2020), or from hierarchical triples in\r
galactic centers, where the tertiary body is a supermas\u0002sive BH (Antonini & Perets 2012; Stephan et al. 2019;\r
Petrovich & Antonini 2017; Hoang et al. 2018; Fragione\r
et al. 2019). Specifically, Safarzadeh et al. (2020) ex\u0002plore the possibility that a second-generation remnant\r
with mass 3 M\f may merge with a 30 M\f BH, cat\u0002alyzed by a 50 M\f-BH perturber. The mass-ratio dis\u0002tributions of BBH and NSBH mergers from hierarchical\r
systems are similar to those of field binaries and it is\r
unclear whether hierarchies may enhance the formation\r
of merging compact-object binaries with highly asym\u0002metric masses (e.g., Silsbee & Tremaine 2017).\r
Disks of gas around supermassive BHs in active galac\u0002tic nuclei may be promising environments for the forma\u0002tion of GW190814-like systems. For such environments,\r
theoretical models show that merging compact-object\r
binaries with asymmetric masses are likely, but cannot\r
necessarily accommodate masses as low as the secondary\r
mass of GW190814 (e.g., Yang et al. 2019). However,\r
McKernan et al. (2020) show that the median mass ratio\r
of NSBH mergers in active galactic nucleus disks may be\r
as low as ∼ 0.07.\r
We conclude that the combination of masses, mass\r
ratio and inferred rate of GW190814 is challenging to\r
explain, but potentially consistent with multiple forma\u0002tion scenarios. However, it is not possible to assess the\r
validity of models that produce the right properties but\r
do not make quantitative predictions about formation\r
rates, even at some order-of-magnitude level.\r
Young star clusters and active galactic nucleus disks\r
seem to be more promising hosts for GW190814-like\r
mergers, since both these environments may enhance\r
the formation of either progenitors of or directly merg\u0002ing compact-object binaries with more asymmetric\r
masses to relevant rates. In contrast, globular-cluster\r
models provide more robust predictions, showing that\r
GW190814-like mergers with such asymmetric masses\r
are outliers in the population predictions, even though a\r
revision of the remnant-mass prescription is still needed.\r
Isolated binaries binaries could prove possible progeni\u0002tors provided similar revisions are implemented. The\r
importance of field multiples remains to be fully ex\u0002plored. Future gravitational-wave observations will pro\u0002vide further insights into the dominance of different\r
channels.\r
6.4. Cosmological Implications

15\r
Luminosity distances inferred directly from observed\r
gravitational-wave events can be used with measure\u0002ments of source redshifts in the electromagnetic spec\u0002trum to constrain cosmological parameters (Schutz\r
1986). Redshifts can be either obtained directly from\r
counterparts to the gravitational-wave source (Holz &\r
Hughes 2005), as was the case for GW170817 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2017a,b,e), by cross-correlation of the\r
gravitational-wave localization posterior with catalogs\r
of galaxy redshifts (Del Pozzo 2012; Nair et al. 2018;\r
Chen et al. 2018; Fishbach et al. 2019; Gray et al.\r
2020; Soares-Santos et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2019c),\r
by exploiting information in the neutron star equation\r
of state (Messenger & Read 2012), or by using the red\u0002shifted masses inferred from the gravitational wave ob\u0002servation and assumptions about the mass distribution\r
of the sources (Chernoff & Finn 1993; Taylor et al.\r
2012; Taylor & Gair 2012; Farr et al. 2019). At cur\u0002rent sensitivities, the cosmological parameter to which\r
LIGO–Virgo observations are most sensitive is the Hub\u0002ble constant, H0. The gravitational-wave observation\r
of GW170817 provided a posterior on H0 with mode\r
and 68.3% highest posterior density interval of H0 =\r
69+22\r
−8\r
km s−1 Mpc−1(Abbott et al. 2017e, 2019b,c),\r
assuming a flat prior on H0.\r
GW190814 is the best localized dark siren, i.e.,\r
gravitational-wave source without an electromagnetic\r
counterpart, observed to date, and so it is a good candi\u0002date for the statistical cross-correlation method. For a\r
fixed reference cosmology (Ade et al. 2016), the GLADE\r
galaxy catalog (D´alya et al. 2018) is approximately\r
40% complete at the distance of GW190814 and con\u0002tains 472 galaxies within the 90% posterior credible vol\u0002ume of GW190814. To obtain a constrain on H0, we\r
use the methodology described in Abbott et al. (2019c)\r
and the GLADE catalog. We take a flat prior for H0 ∈\r
[20, 140] km s−1 Mpc−1 and assign a probability to each\r
galaxy that it is the true host of the event that is pro\u0002portional to its B-band luminosity. Using the posterior\r
distribution on the distance obtained from the combined\r
PHM samples, we obtain H0 = 75+59\r
−13 km s−1Mpc−1\r
us\u0002ing GW190814 alone (mode and 68.3% highest posterior\r
density interval; the median and 90% symmetric credi\u0002ble interval is H0 = 83+55\r
−53 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
), which can be\r
compared to H0 = 75+40\r
−32 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
(Soares-Santos\r
et al. 2019) obtained using the dark siren GW170814\r
alone. The GW190814 result is the most precise mea\u0002surement from a single dark siren observation to date,\r
albeit comparable to the GW170814 result, which is\r
expected given GW190814’s small localization volume\r
(∼ 39000 Mpc3). The result is not very constraining,\r
with the 68.3% highest posterior density interval com\u0002prising 60% of the prior range. Combining the result for\r
GW190814 with the result obtained from GW170817, we\r
see an improvement over the GW170817-only result, to\r
H0 = 70+17\r
−8\r
km s−1 Mpc−1(the median and 90% sym\u0002metric credible interval is H0 = 77+33\r
−23 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
).\r
This result is not yet sufficiently constraining to pro\u0002vide further insight into current tensions in low and high\r
redshift measurements of the Hubble constant (Verde\r
et al. 2019), but these constraints will continue to im\u0002prove as further gravitational-wave observations are in\u0002cluded (e.g., projections in Chen et al. 2018; Vitale &\r
Chen 2018; Gray et al. 2020; Feeney et al. 2019).\r
7. CONCLUSIONS\r
During their third observing run, on 2019 August 14,\r
21:10:39 UTC, the LIGO and Virgo detectors observed\r
GW190814, a novel source unlike any other known com\u0002pact binary coalescence. Thanks in part to the obser\u0002vation of significant power in subdominant multipoles\r
of the gravitational radiation, and the conclusive mea\u0002surement of little to no spin precession, we obtain pre\u0002cise measurements of its physical source properties that\r
clearly set it apart from other compact binaries.\r
In particular, (a) its mass ratio of q = 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009\r
is the most unequal ever observed with gravitational\r
waves, (b) the bound χ1 ≤ 0.07 on the spin of the\r
23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f BH is the strongest constraint on a primary\r
spin for any gravitational-wave source to date, and (c)\r
the secondary mass measurement of 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f makes\r
it the lightest BH or the heaviest NS discovered in a dou\u0002ble compact-object system. We find no evidence of mea\u0002surable tidal effects in the signal, and no electromagnetic\r
counterpart to the gravitational waves has been identi\u0002fied.\r
Comparisons between the secondary mass and sev\u0002eral current estimates of the maximum NS mass sug\u0002gest that GW190814 is unlikely to originate in a NSBH\r
coalescence. Nevertheless, the Mmax estimates are un\u0002certain enough that improved knowledge of the NS EOS\r
or further observations of the astrophysical population\r
of compact objects could alter this assessment. For this\r
reason, we cannot firmly exclude the possibility that the\r
secondary is a NS, nor can we be certain that it is a BH.\r
Regardless, this event sheds new light on the compact\u0002object mass distribution at the interface between known\r
NSs and BHs.\r
The unique combination of masses and inferred merger\r
rate for this event is difficult to produce in population\r
synthesis models of multi-component systems in galactic\r
fields or dense stellar environments. The discovery of\r
GW190814 may therefore reshape our understanding of\r
the processes by which the lightest BHs or the most

16\r
massive NSs form. Based on our rate density estimate,\r
we may reasonably expect to detect more systems of this\r
kind after a year at design sensitivity. This discovery\r
may prove to be the first hint of a larger population\r
that could change our perspective on the formation and\r
mass spectrum of compact objects.\r

Software: The detection of the signal and subse\u0002quent significance evaluation were performed with the\r
GstLAL-based inspiral software pipeline (Cannon et al.\r
2012; Privitera et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev\r
et al. 2019; Hanna et al. 2020), built on the LALSuite\r
software library (LIGO Scientific Collaboration 2018),\r
and with the PyCBC (Nitz et al. 2018, 2019; Usman\r
et al. 2016) and MBTAOnline (Adams et al. 2016)\r
packages. Parameter estimation was performed with the\r
LALInference (Veitch et al. 2015) and LALSimula\u0002tion libraries within LALSuite (LIGO Scientific Col\u0002laboration 2018), as well as the Bilby and pBilby Li\u0002braries (Ashton et al. 2019; Smith & Ashton 2019) and\r
the dynesty nested sampling package (Speagle 2020).\r
Interpretation and curation of the posterior samples was\r
handled by the PESummary library (Hoy & Raymond\r
2020). Estimates of the noise spectra were obtained us\u0002ing BayesWave (Cornish & Littenberg 2015; Littenberg\r
& Cornish 2015). Plots were prepared with Matplotlib\r
(Hunter 2007). The sky map plot also used Astropy\r
(http://www.astropy.org) a community-developed core\r
Python package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration\r
et al. 2013; Price-Whelan et al. 2018) and ligo.skymap\r
(https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/ligo.skymap).

GW190814: Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a 23 M\f Black Hole\r
with a 2.6 M\f Compact Object\r
LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration\r
(Dated: June 24, 2020)\r
ABSTRACT\r
We report the observation of a compact binary coalescence involving a 22.2 – 24.3 M\f black hole and\r
a compact object with a mass of 2.50 – 2.67 M\f (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level).\r
The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing\r
run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector\r
network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of 241+41\r
−45 Mpc; no electromagnetic\r
counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured\r
with gravitational waves, 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009, and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole\r
or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless\r
spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to ≤ 0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no\r
measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at\r
high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc−3 yr−1for the new class of binary\r
coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass\r
ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in\r
globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger\r
rate for this event challenges all current models for the formation and mass distribution of compact\u0002object binaries."""

The first two observing runs (O1 and O2) with\r

the first binary black hole (BBH) coalescence signal,\r
GW150914 (Abbott et al. 2016a). Another nine such\r

the LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations (LVC)\r
during this period, and additional events were reported\r
by independent groups (Venumadhav et al. 2020; Za\u0002ckay et al. 2019a,b; Nitz et al. 2020). The first binary\r
neutron star (BNS) coalescence signal, GW170817, was\r
discovered during the second of these observing cam\u0002paigns (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2019b). It proved to be a\r
multi-messenger source with emission across the electro\u0002magnetic spectrum (Abbott et al. 2017b), with implica\u0002tions for the origin of short gamma-ray bursts (Abbott\r

At the time of GW190814, LIGO Hanford, LIGO Liv\u0002ingston and Virgo were operating with typical O3 sen\u0002sitivities (Abbott et al. 2020a). Although LIGO Han\u0002ford was in a stable operating configuration at the time\r

We used validation procedures similar to those used\r
to vet previous gravitational-wave events (Abbott et al.\r
2016c, 2019a). Overall we found no evidence that instru\u0002mental or environmental disturbances (Effler et al. 2015)\r
could account for GW190814. However, we did identify\r
low-frequency transient noise due to scattered light at\r
LIGO Livingston, a common source of noise in all three

3\r
interferometers (Nuttall 2018). Scattered light features\r
in the strain data are produced when a small fraction\r
of the main laser beam reflects off a moving surface and\r
is phase modulated before recombining with the main\r
beam. This recombination can result in excess noise\r
with the morphology of arches in the time–frequency\r
plane; the frequency of this noise is determined by the\r
velocity of the moving surface (Accadia et al. 2010).\r
Thunderstorms near LIGO Livingston around the time\r
of GW190814 resulted in acoustic noise coupling to the\r
detector and caused features in the strain data asso\u0002ciated with scattered light (Abbott et al. 2019a). In\r
this instance, this form of noise affects frequencies up\r
to 30 Hz from roughly 22 s to 8 s before and 0.2 s to\r
1.5 s after the detected time of GW190814, as seen in the\r
middle panel of Figure 1. Since this noise could bias the\r
estimation of GW190814’s source parameters, we used a\r
starting frequency of 30 Hz to analyse LIGO Livingston\r
data. Virgo was operating nominally and there are no\r
quality issues in the Virgo data.\r
The LIGO and Virgo detectors are calibrated by pho\u0002ton pressure from modulated auxiliary lasers inducing\r
test-mass motion (Karki et al. 2016; Acernese et al.\r

2016) as filter templates. A Notice was issued through\r
NASA’s Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN) 20\r
min later (LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Col\u0002laboration 2019a) with a two-detector source local\u0002ization computed using the rapid Bayesian algorithm\r
BAYESTAR (Singer & Price 2016) that is shown in\r
Figure 2. The event was initially classified as “Mass\u0002Gap” (Kapadia et al. 2020; LIGO Scientific Collabora\u0002tion, Virgo Collaboration 2019b), implying that at least\r
one of the binary merger components was found to have\r
a mass between 3–5 M\f in the low-latency analyses.\r
Other low-latency searches, including the matched\u0002filtering based MBTA (Adams et al. 2016) and Py\u0002CBC (Usman et al. 2016; Nitz et al. 2017; Nitz et al.\r
2018, 2019) pipelines, could not detect the event at\r
the time as its SNR in Virgo data was below their\r
single-detector detection thresholds. Test versions of\r
MBTA and the additional matched-filtering pipeline\r
SPIIR (Hooper et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2012; Guo et al.\r
2018) operating with a lower SNR threshold also iden\u0002tified the event with consistent attributes.\r
Shortly thereafter, reanalyses including LIGO Han\u0002ford data were performed using GstLAL and PyCBC.\r
A coincident gravitational-wave signal was identified in\r
all three detectors by both searches, with SNR 21.6 in\r
LIGO Livingston, 10.6 in LIGO Hanford, and 4.5 in\r
Virgo data (as measured by GstLAL, consistent with\r
SNRs reported by PyCBC). Results of these 3-detector\r
analyses were reported in a GCN Circular within 2.3\r
hours of the time of the event (LIGO Scientific Col\u0002laboration, Virgo Collaboration 2019c,d), providing a\r
3-detector localization (Singer & Price 2016) constrain\u0002ing the distance to 220–330 Mpc and the sky area to\r
38 deg2 at the 90% credible level. Another GCN Cir\u0002cular (LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Virgo Collabora\u0002tion 2019e) sent 13.5 hours after the event updated the\r
source localization to a distance of 215–320 Mpc, the\r
sky area to 23 deg2, and the source classification to\r
“NSBH” (Kapadia et al. 2020; LIGO Scientific Collabo\u0002ration, Virgo Collaboration 2019b), indicating that the\r
secondary had a mass below 3 M\f. These updated sky\r
localizations are also shown in Figure 2. The two dis\u0002joint sky localizations arise because the low SNR in the\r
Virgo detector (4.5) means that the data are consistent\r
with two different signal arrival times in that detector."""

The significance of GW190814 was estimated by\r
follow-up searches using improved calibration and re\u0002fined data-quality information that are not available in\r
low latency. They also used longer stretches of data for\r
better precision (Abbott et al. 2016b,c). With LIGO\r
Hanford data being usable but not in nominal observing\r
mode at the time of GW190814, we used only data from\r
the LIGO Livingston and Virgo detectors for significance\r
estimation. GW190814 was identified as a confident de\u0002tection in analyses of detector data collected over the\r
period from August 7 to August 15, 2019 by the two in\u0002dependent matched-filtering searches GstLAL and Py\u0002CBC, with SNR values consistent with the low-latency\r
analyses. The production version of PyCBC for O3 es\u0002timates significance only for events that are coincident\r
in the LIGO Hanford and LIGO Livingston detectors,\r
and therefore an extended version (Davies et al. 2020)\r
was used for GW190814 in order to enable the use of\r
Virgo data in significance estimation.\r
GstLAL and PyCBC use different techniques for es\u0002timating the noise background and methods of ranking\r
gravitational-wave candidates. Both use results from\r
searches over non time-coincident data to improve their\r
noise background estimation (Privitera et al. 2014; Mes\u0002sick et al. 2017; Usman et al. 2016). Using data from\r
the first six months of O3 and including all events dur\u0002ing this period in the estimation of noise background,\r
GstLAL estimated a false-alarm rate (FAR) of 1 in\r
1.3 × 103 yr for GW190814. Using data from the 8-day\r
period surrounding GW190814 and including this and\r
all quieter events during this period in noise background\r
estimation, the extended PyCBC pipeline (Davies et al.\r
2020) estimated a FAR for the event of 1 in 8.1 yr.\r
The higher FAR estimate from PyCBC can be at\u0002tributed to the event being identified by the pipeline\r
as being quieter than multiple noise events in Virgo\r
data. As PyCBC estimates background statistics using\r
non-coincident data from both detectors, these louder\r
noise events in Virgo data can form chance coincidences\r

GW190814 by PyCBC were indeed confirmed to be co\u0002incidences of the candidate event itself in LIGO Liv\u0002ingston with random noise events in Virgo. The stated\r
background estimates are therefore conservative (Ca\u0002pano et al. 2016a). We also estimate the background\r
excluding the candidate from the calculation, a proce\u0002dure that yields a mean-unbiased estimation of the dis\u0002tribution of noise events (Capano et al. 2016a; Abbott\r
et al. 2016d). In this case, with GstLAL we found a\r
FAR of < 1 in 105 yr while with PyCBC we found a\r
FAR of < 1 in 4.2 × 104 yr. With both pipelines iden\u0002tifying GW190814 as more significant than any event in\r
the background, the FARs assigned are upper bounds.\r
When data from LIGO Hanford were included,\r
GW190814 was also identified by the unmodelled co\u0002herent Wave Burst (cWB) search that targets generic\r
gravitational-wave transients with increasing frequency\r
over time without relying on waveform models (Kli\u0002menko et al. 2008, 2016; Abbott et al. 2016e). We found\r
a FAR of < 1 in 103 yr of observing time against the\r
noise background from LIGO Hanford and LIGO Liv\u0002ingston data, consistent with the other searches."""

for the SEOBNRv4PHM (EOBNR PHM) and IMRPhenomPv3HM (Phenom PHM) waveform models. The primary spin\r
magnitude and the effective precession is given as the 90% upper limit. The inclination angle is folded to [0, π/2]. The last\r
column is the result of combining the posteriors of each model with equal weight. The sky location of GW190814 is shown in\r
Figure 2.\r
We infer the physical properties of GW190814 using a\r
coherent Bayesian analysis of the data from LIGO Liv\u0002ingston, LIGO Hanford and Virgo following the method\u0002ology described in Appendix B of Abbott et al. (2019a).\r
Results presented here are obtained using 16 s of data\r
around the time of detection. We use a low-frequency\r
cutoff of 20 Hz for LIGO Hanford and Virgo and 30 Hz\r
for LIGO Livingston for the likelihood evaluations, and\r
we choose uninformative and wide priors, as defined in\r
Appendix B.1 of Abbott et al. (2019a). The LALInfer\u0002ence stochastic sampling software (Veitch et al. 2015) is\r
the primary tool used to sample the posterior distribu\u0002tion. A parallelized version of the parameter estimation\r
software bilby (pbilby; Smith & Ashton 2019; Ashton\r
et al. 2019) is used for computationally expensive signal\r
models. The power spectral density used in the likeli\u0002hood calculations is a fair draw estimate calculated with\r
BayesWave (Cornish & Littenberg 2015; Littenberg &\r
Cornish 2015).\r
This signal is analyzed under two different assump\u0002tions: that it represents a BBH, or that it represents a\r
NSBH. For the BBH analyses, two different waveform\r
families are used, one based on the effective-one-body\r
approach (EOBNR; Boh´e et al. 2017; Babak et al. 2017;\r
Cotesta et al. 2018; Ossokine et al. 2020) and the other\r
on a phenomenological approach (Phenom; Khan et al.\r
2016; Husa et al. 2016; London et al. 2018; Khan et al.\r
2019; Khan et al. 2020).\r
For the NSBH analyses, we use BBH waveform mod\u0002els augmented with tidal effects (Matas et al. 2020;\r
Thompson et al. 2020). Systematic uncertainties due\r
to waveform modeling are expected to be subdomi\u0002nant compared to statistical errors (Huang et al. 2020).\r
When sampling the parameter space with the SEOB\u0002NRv4 ROM NRTidalv2 NSBH (Matas et al. 2020)\r
and IMRPhenomNSBH (Thompson et al. 2020) wave\u0002form models, we obtained posterior distributions for\r
the secondary component’s tidal deformability Λ2 that\r
are uninformative relative to a uniform prior in Λ2 ∈\r
[0, 3000]. The absence of a measurable tidal signature is\r
consistent with the highly unequal mass ratio (Foucart\r
et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2017) and with the relatively\r
large secondary mass (Flanagan & Hinderer 2008). The\r
large asymmetry in the masses implies that the binary\r
will merge before the neutron star is tidally disrupted for\r
any expected NS equation of state (Foucart et al. 2013).\r
Given that the signal carries no discernible information

6\r
about matter effects, here we present quantitative re\u0002sults only from BBH waveform models.\r
Our primary analyses include the effect of subdom\u0002inant multipole moments in precessing waveform tem\u0002plate models (PHM): IMRPhenomPv3HM (Phenom\r
PHM; Khan et al. 2019; Khan et al. 2020) from the phe\u0002nomenological family and SEOBNRv4PHM (EOBNR\r
PHM; Babak et al. 2017; Ossokine et al. 2020) from the\r
EOBNR family.1 Analyses that assume the spins are\r
aligned with the orbital angular momentum were also\r
performed, either including (Phenom/EOBNR HM) or\r
excluding (Phenom/EOBNR) the effect of subdominant\r

From the ∼ 300 observed cycles above 20 Hz, we\r
are able to tightly constrain the source properties of\r
GW190814. Our analysis shows that GW190814’s\r
source is a binary with an unequal mass ratio q =\r
0.112+0.008\r
−0.009, with individual source masses m1 =\r
23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f and m2 = 2.59+0.08−0.09 M\f, as shown in\r
Figure 3. A summary of the inferred source prop\u0002erties is given in Table 1. We assume a standard\r
flat ΛCDM cosmology with Hubble constant H0 =\r
67.9 km s−1 Mpc−1(Ade et al. 2016).\r
We report detailed results obtained from the two pre\u0002cessing BBH signal models including subdominant mul\u0002tipole moments: Phenom PHM and EOBNR PHM. In\r
order to compare the template models, we compute their\r
Bayes factor (log10 B). We find no significant evidence\r
that one waveform family is preferred over the other as\r
the Bayes factor between Phenom PHM and EOBNR\r
PHM is log10 B ' 1.0. As a result, we combine the\r
posterior samples with equal weight, in effect marginal\u0002izing over a discrete set of signal models with a uniform\r
probability. This is shown in the last column of Table 1,\r
and we refer to these values throughout the paper unless\r
stated otherwise.\r
We find that the secondary mass lies in the\r
range 2.50– 2.67 M\f. This inferred secondary mass\r
exceeds the bounds of the primary component in\r
GW190425 (1.61–2.52 M\f; Abbott et al. 2020a) and the\r
most massive known pulsar in the Galaxy: 2.14+0.10\r
−0.09 M\f\r
at 68.3% credible interval (Cromartie et al. 2019). Fur\u0002thermore, the secondary is more massive than bounds\r
on the maximum NS mass from studies of the rem\u0002nant of GW170817, and from theoretical (Abbott et al.\r
1\r
In the co-precessing frame the EOBNR model in\u0002cludes the (l, m) = (2, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±3), (4, ±4) and\r
(5, ±5) multipoles, and the Phenom model includes the\r
(2, ±2), (2, ±1), (3, ±3), (3, ±2), (4, ±4) and (4, ±3) multipoles.\r
2018) and observational estimates (Farr & Chatziioan\u0002nou 2020). The inferred secondary mass is comparable\r
to the putative BH remnant mass of GW170817 (Abbott\r
et al. 2019b).\r
The primary object is identified as a BH based on its\r
measured mass of 23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f. Due to accurately ob\u0002serving the frequency evolution over a long inspiral, the\r
chirp mass is well constrained to 6.09+0.06\r
−0.06 M\f. The in\u0002ferred mass ratio q = 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009 makes GW190814 only\r
the second gravitational-wave observation with a signif\u0002icantly unequal mass ratio (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2020d).\r
Given that this system is in a region of the parame\u0002ter space that has not been explored via gravitational\u0002wave emission previously, we test possible waveform sys\u0002tematics by comparing the Phenom and EOB waveform\r
families. Differences in the inferred secondary mass are\r
shown in Figure 4. The results indicate that the inferred\r
secondary mass is robust to possible waveform system\u0002atics, with good agreement between the Phenom PHM\r
and EOBNR PHM signal models. Signal models that\r
exclude higher multipoles or precession do not constrain\r
the secondary mass as well.\r
The time delay of a signal across a network of gravi\u0002tational wave detectors, together with the relative am\u0002plitude and phase at each detector, allows us to mea\u0002sure the location of the GW source on the sky (Abbott\r
et al. 2020b). We localize GW190814’s source to within\r
18.5 deg2at 90% probability, as shown in Figure 2. This\r
is comparable to the localization of GW170817 (Abbott\r
et al. 2017a, 2019a).\r
Spins are a fundamental property of BHs. Their mag\u0002nitude and orientation carry information regarding the\r
evolution history of the binary. The effective inspiral\r
spin parameter χeff (Damour 2001; Racine 2008; Ajith\r
et al. 2011; Santamar´ıa et al. 2010) contains informa\u0002tion about the spin components that are perpendicular\r
to the orbital plane. We infer that χeff = −0.002+0.060\r
−0.061.\r
The tight constraints are consistent with being able to\r
measure the phase evolution from the long inspiral.\r
Orbital precession occurs when there is a significant\r
spin component in the orbital plane of the binary (Apos\u0002tolatos et al. 1994). We parameterize precession by the\r
effective precession spin parameter 0 ≤ χp ≤ 1 (Schmidt\r
et al. 2015). This effect is difficult to measure for face-on\r
and face-off systems (Apostolatos et al. 1994; Buonanno\r
et al. 2003; Vitale et al. 2014, 2017; Fairhurst et al.\r
2019a,b). GW190814 constrains the inclination of the\r
binary to be Θ = 0.8\r
+0.3\r
−0.2\r
rad. Since the system is nei\u0002ther face-on nor face-off, we are able to put strong con\u0002straints on the precession of the system: χp = 0.04+0.04\r
−0.03.\r
This is both the strongest constraint on the amount of\r
precession for any gravitational-wave detection to date,

the empirical Mmax distribution from the population model\r
of Farr & Chatziioannou (2020) is shown in green. The grey\r
dashed line and shading represent the measured mass of the\r
heaviest pulsar in the Galaxy (median and 68% confidence in\u0002terval; Cromartie et al. 2019). The solid grey band at 2.3 M\f\r
is the upper bound on Mmax from studies of GW170817’s\r
merger remnant.\r
and the first gravitational-wave measurement which con\u0002clusively measures near-zero precession (Abbott et al.\r
2019a, 2020a,d).\r
By computing the Bayes factor between a precessing\r
and non-precessing signal model (log10B ∼ 0.5 in favor\r
of precession), we find inconclusive evidence for in-plane\r
spin. This is consistent with the inferred power from\r
precession SNR ρp (Fairhurst et al. 2019a,b), whose re\u0002covered distribution resembles that expected in the ab\u0002sence of any precession in the signal; see Figure 5. The\r
ρp calculation assumes a signal dominated by the ` = 2\r
mode; however, we have verified that the contribution of\r
higher harmonics to the measurement of spin precession\r
is subdominant by a factor of 5. The data are therefore\r
consistent with the signal from a non-precessing system.\r

Phenom/EOBNR (aligned-spin, quadrupole only) indicate\r
the different physical content in each of the waveform mod\u0002els.\r
Figure 4 shows that signal models including spin\u0002precession effects give tighter constraints on the sec\u0002ondary mass compared to their non-precessing equiva\u0002lents. Signal models that include spin-precession effects\r
can constrain χp, whereas non-precessing signal mod\u0002els cannot provide information on in-plane spin com\u0002ponents. In all analyses, we assume a prior equivalent\r
to spin orientations being isotropically distributed. We\r
find that the data are inconsistent with large χp and\r
consistent with any secondary spin. Therefore, for pre\u0002cessing signal models the allowed q–χeff parameter space\r
is restricted, which helps to break the degeneracy (Pois\u0002son & Will 1995; Baird et al. 2013; Farr et al. 2016;\r
Baird et al. 2013; Ng et al. 2018). Consequently, the\r
extra information from constraining χp to small values\r
enables a more precise measurement of the secondary\r
mass.\r
The asymmetry in the masses of GW190814 means\r
that the spin of the more massive object dominates con\u0002tributions to χeff and χp. As both χeff and χp are tightly\r
constrained, we are able to bound the primary spin of\r
GW190814 to be χ1 ≤ 0.07, as shown in Figure 6. This\r
is the strongest constraint on the primary spin for any\r
gravitational-wave event to date (Abbott et al. 2019a,\r
2020a,d).\r
The joint posterior probability of the magnitude and\r
orientation of χ1 and χ2 are shown in Figure 6. De\u0002viations from uniform shading indicate a spin property\r
measurement. The primary spin is tightly constrained\r
to small magnitudes, but its orientation is indistinguish-

The relative importance of a subdominant multipole\r
moment increases with mass ratio. Each subdominant\r
multipole moment has a different angular dependence\r
on the emission direction. With significant evidence\r
for multipoles other than the dominant (`, m) = (2, 2)\r
quadrupole, we gain an independent measurement of the\r
inclination of the source. This allows for the distance\u0002inclination degeneracy to be broken (Cutler & Flanagan\r
1994; Abbott et al. 2016f; Usman et al. 2019; Kalaghatgi\r

GW190814’s stronger evidence for higher multipoles is\r

The orthogonal optimal SNR of a subdominant mul\u0002tipole is calculated by decomposing each multipole into\r

Finally, we perform two complementary analyses in\u0002volving time–frequency tracks in the data to provide fur\u0002ther evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the\r

track of the dominant (2, 2) multipole in the LIGO Liv\u0002ingston detector (as seen in Figure 1, middle panel) from\r
an EOBNR HM parameter estimation analysis. This\r
analysis collects energies along a time–frequency track\r
which is α × f22(t), the (2, 2) multipole’s instantaneous\r
frequency, where α is a dimensionless parameter (Roy\r
et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d). We find prominent\r
peaks in Y (α), the energy in the pixels along the α-th\r
track defined in Abbott et al. (2020d), at α = 1 and 1.5,\r
as can be seen from the on-source curve in the top panel\r
of Figure 7. These peaks correspond to the m = 2 and\r
m = 3 multipole predictions in the data containing the\r
signal (on-source data). We also compute a detection\r
statistic β (Roy et al. 2019) of 10.09 for the presence of\r
the m = 3 multipole with a p-value of < 2.5 × 10−4,\r
compared to a background distribution estimated over\r
18 hours of data adjacent to the event (off-source data),\r
where the largest background β is 7.59. The signifi\u0002cant difference between on- and off-source values pro\u0002vides much stronger evidence for the presence of higher\r
multipoles than what is reported for GW190412 (Abbott\r
et al. 2020d).\r
The second analysis uses waveform-agnostic methods\r
to reconstruct the signal. It then compares the ob\u0002served coherent signal energy in the LIGO Hanford–\r
LIGO Livingston–Virgo network of detectors, as iden\u0002tified by the cWB detection pipeline (Klimenko et al.\r
2016), with the predictions of a waveform model with\u0002out higher multipoles (EOBNR; Prodi et al. 2020) to\r
investigate if the description of the underlying signal is\r
incomplete if we do not include contributions from the\r
m = 3 multipole in our waveform model. We compute a\r
test statistic, the squared sum of the coherent residuals\r
estimated over selected time–frequency tracks parame\u0002terized in terms of the same α parameter defined in the\r
previous analysis (Roy et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
Each time–frequency track centered on α includes fre\u0002quencies within [α − 0.1, α + 0.1] × f22(t), and times\r
within [tmerger − 0.5 s, tmerger − 0.03 s], where f22(t) and\r
tmerger correspond to the maximum likelihood template\r
from the EOBNR parameter estimation analysis. We\r
further compute a background distribution using simu\u0002lated signals in off-source data (Prodi et al. 2020), and\r
compute p-values for the on-source results as a func\u0002tion of α (Figure 7, bottom panel). We find a minimum\r
p–value of 6.8 × 10−3 at α = 1.5, providing strong ev\u0002idence that the disagreement between the actual event\r
and the EOBNR prediction is because of the absence\r
of the m = 3 multipoles in the waveform model. The\r
local minimum near α = 2 is not an indication of the\r
m = 4 multipoles, but rather a statistical fluctuation\r
which is consistent with similar behaviour seen for stud\u0002ies with simulated signals described in detail in Prodi\r
et al. (2020).\r
Although the two time–frequency analyses are simi\u0002lar in motivation, the latter differs from the former in\r
that it is not restricted to data from just one detector,\r
but rather uses the coherent signal energy across the\r
three-detector network. Both analyses point to strong\r
evidence for the presence of higher multipoles in the sig\u0002nal."""

tests of GR (Abbott et al. 2016g, 2019e,d). The asym\u0002metric nature of a system excites the higher multipole\r

test the multipolar structure of gravity (Kastha et al.\r

First, as a consistency test of the signal reconstruc\u0002tion, we subtract from the data the maximum like\u0002lihood compact binary coalescence waveforms, Phe\u0002nom (Khan et al. 2016), Phenom HM (Kalaghatgi\r

of the resulting residual data centered around the time\r
of merger with the morphology-independent transient\r
analysis BayesWave (Cornish & Littenberg 2015; Lit\u0002tenberg & Cornish 2015). We measure the 90% credible\r
upper limit on the coherent SNR, ρ90, and compare it\r
to the SNR, ρ\r
N\r
90, recovered by analyzing 175 randomly\r
selected data segments in surrounding time (off–source\r
data) with the same configuration settings. If the resid\u0002ual data are consistent with the noise, we expect ρ90\r
to be consistent with ρ\r

by comparing the distribution of ρ\r
N\r
90 to ρ90 through\r
p = P(ρ\r
N\r
90 < ρ90). We obtain p-values of 0.59, 0.82,\r
0.82, and 0.75 for Phenom, Phenom HM, Phenom PHM,\r
and EOBNR PHM, respectively. Hence, we find no evi\u0002dence for deviations in the behavior of the residual data\r
stream.\r
We also look for deviations in the spin-induced\r
quadrupole moments of the binary components. Accord\u0002ing to the no-hair conjecture (Carter 1971; Hansen 1974)\r
the multipole moments of a Kerr BH are completely\r
described by its mass and spin angular momentum.\r
At leading order in spin, the spin-induced quadrupole\r
moment scalar is (Hartle 1967; Pappas & Apostolatos\r
2012), Q = −κa2m3, where (m, a) are the mass and\r
dimensionless spin of the compact object, and κ is a\r
dimensionless deformation parameter characterizing de\u0002viations in the spin-induced quadrupole moment. Kerr\r
BHs have κ = 1 (Thorne 1980), while κ ∼ 2–14 for NSs\r
(depending on the equation of state) and κ ∼ 10–150\r
for spinning boson stars with large self-interaction (Ryan\r
1997). The deformation parameter can even be negative\r
for (slowly-rotating, thin-shelled) gravastars (Uchikata\r
et al. 2016). Hence, an accurate measurement of κ\r
sheds light onto the nature of the compact object. For\r
compact binaries, the spin-induced quadrupole moment\r
terms appear at second post-Newtonian order (Poisson\r
1998). For Kerr BHs in GR, κ1 = κ2 = 1, where\r
κ1, κ2 are the individual deformation parameters of the\r
primary and secondary compact objects in the binary.\r
Since κ1 and κ2 are strongly degenerate in the gravita\u0002tional waveform, we instead measure a linear symmetric\r
combination of these quantities, κs = (κ1+κ2)/2, which\r
is 1 for a BBH in GR. The posteriors on κs are rela\u0002tively uninformative, and nearly span the prior range\r
of [0, 500], with increased support at κs = 0 relative to\r
the prior. The upper bound of the prior was chosen to\r
accommodate all the objects listed above. The result\r
shows that GW190814 is consistent with having a BBH\r
source described by GR. However, the broad posterior\r
means that we cannot exclude the possibility that one\r
or both components of the source is not a BH. We can\r
attempt to understand this result in terms of the spin\r
measurements for the binary. The measurements of κs\r
and a non-zero χeff are highly correlated (Krishnendu\r
et al. 2019), and for a system with small χeff the bounds\r
on the measured value of κs are weak.\r
Finally, we investigate the source dynamics of the\r
binary through a parameterized test of gravitational\r
waveform generation, where we allow for the coeffi\u0002cients describing the post-Newtonian inspiral of a BBH\r
coalescence to deviate away from their predictions in\r
GR (Arun et al. 2006a,b; Yunes & Pretorius 2009;\r
Mishra et al. 2010; Cornish et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012;\r
Meidam et al. 2018). We use an aligned-spin EOB wave\u0002form without higher modes (EOBNR), and find no de\u0002viations in the post-Newtonian coefficients from their\r
nominal values in GR. In summary, none of our tests of\r
GR indicate any departure from the predictions of the\r
theory, and GW190814 is consistent with the description\r
of a compact binary merger in GR."""

known NSs and BHs. It is heavier than the most mas\u0002sive pulsar in the Galaxy (Cromartie et al. 2019), and al\u0002most certainly exceeds the mass of the 1.61–2.52 M\f pri\u0002mary component of GW190425, which is itself an out\u0002lier relative to the Galactic population of BNSs (Abbott\r
et al. 2020a). On the other hand, it is comparable in\r
mass to two BH candidates: the ' 2.7 M\f merger rem\u0002nant of GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2019b) and the 2.6–\r
6.1 M\f compact object (95% confidence interval) dis\u0002covered by Thompson et al. (2019).2\r
It is also compara\u0002ble to the millisecond pulsar PSR J1748−2021B (Freire\r

−0.21M\f at\r
68% confidence. However, this estimate, obtained via\r
measurement of the periastron advance, could be inac\u0002curate if the system inclination is low or the pulsar’s\r
companion is rapidly rotating (Freire et al. 2008). In\r
sum, it is not clear if GW190814’s secondary is a BH or\r
a NS.\r
GW190814 poses a challenge for our understanding of\r
the population of merging compact binaries. In what\r

et al. (2018), based on an analysis of GW170817 with\r
a spectral parameterization (Lindblom 2010; Lindblom\r

the corresponding Mmax posterior distribution, shown\r

informed spectral EOS samples used in Abbott et al.\r
(2018) by reconstructing each EOS from its parameters\r
and computing its maximum mass. Comparison with\r
the m2 posterior suggests that the secondary component\r
of GW190814 is probably more massive than this predic\u0002tion for Mmax: the posterior probability of m2 ≤ Mmax,\r
marginalized over the uncertainty in m2 and Mmax, is\r
only 3%. Nevertheless, the maximum mass predictions\r
from these kinds of EOS inferences come with impor\u0002tant caveats: their extrapolations are sensitive to the\r
phenomenological model assumed for the EOS; they use\r
hard Mmax thresholds on the EOS prior to account for\r
the existence of the heaviest Galactic pulsars, which is\r
known to bias the inferred maximum mass distribution\r
towards the threshold (Miller et al. 2020); and they pre\u0002date the NICER observatory’s recent simultaneous mass\r
and radius measurement for J0030+0451, which may in\u0002crease the Mmax estimates by a few percent (Landry\r
et al. 2020) because it favors slightly stiffer EOSs than\r
GW170817 (Raaijmakers et al. 2019; Riley et al. 2019;\r
Miller et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2020).\r
NS mass measurements also inform bounds on Mmax\r
independently of EOS assumptions. Fitting the known\r
population of NSs in binaries to a double-Gaussian mass\r
distribution with a high-mass cutoff, Alsing et al. (2018)\r
obtained an empirical constraint of Mmax ≤ 2.6 M\f\r
(one-sided 90% confidence interval). Farr & Chatzi\u0002ioannou (2020) recently updated this analysis to in\u0002clude PSR J0740+6620 (Cromartie et al. 2019), which\r
had not been discovered at the time of the original\r
study. Based on samples from the Farr & Chatzi\u0002ioannou (2020) maximum-mass posterior distribution,\r
which is plotted in the right panel of Figure 3, we\r
find Mmax = 2.25+0.81\r
−0.26 M\f. In this case, the posterior\r
probability of m2 ≤ Mmax is 29%, again favoring the\r
m2 > Mmax scenario, albeit less strongly because of the\r
distribution’s long tail up to ∼ 3 M\f. However, the em\u0002pirical Mmax prediction is sensitive to selection effects\r
that could potentially bias it (Alsing et al. 2018). In\r
particular, masses are only measurable for binary pul\u0002sars, and the mass distribution of isolated NSs could be\r
different. Additionally, the discovery of GW190425 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2020a) should also be taken into account in\r
the population when predicting Mmax.\r
Finally, the NS maximum mass is constrained by stud\u0002ies of the merger remnant of GW170817. Although no\r
postmerger gravitational waves were observed (Abbott\r
et al. 2017g, 2019f), modeling of the associated kilonova\r
(Abbott et al. 2017b; Kasen et al. 2017; Villar et al. 2017;\r
Cowperthwaite et al. 2017; Abbott et al. 2017d) sug\u0002gests that the merger remnant collapsed to a BH after\r
a brief supramassive or hypermassive NS phase during\r
which it was stabilized by uniform or differential rota\u0002tion. Assuming this ultimate fate for the merger rem\u0002nant immediately implies that no NS can be stable above\r
∼ 2.7 M\f, but it places a more stringent constraint on\r
NSs that are not rotationally supported. The precise\r
mapping from the collapse threshold mass of the rem\u0002nant to Mmax depends on the EOS, but by developing\r
approximate prescriptions based on sequences of rapidly\r
rotating stars for a range of candidate EOSs, Mmax has\r
been bounded below approximately 2.2–2.3 M\f (Mar\u0002galit & Metzger 2017; Rezzolla et al. 2018; Ruiz et al.\r

not a NS: the m2 posterior distribution has negligible\r
support below 2.3 M\f.\r
Overall, these considerations suggest that GW190814\r
is probably not the product of a NSBH coalescence, de\u0002spite its preliminary classification as such. Nonetheless,\r
the possibility that the secondary component is a NS\r
cannot be completely discounted due to the current un\u0002certainty in Mmax.\r
There are two further caveats to this assessment.\r
First, because the secondary’s spin is unconstrained, it\r
could conceivably be rotating rapidly enough for m2\r
to exceed Mmax without triggering gravitational col\u0002lapse: rapid uniform rotation can stabilize a star up\r
to ∼ 20% more massive than the nonrotating maximum\r
mass (Cook et al. 1994), in which case only the absolute\r
upper bound of ∼ 2.7 M\f is relevant. However, it is very\r
unlikely that a NSBH system could merge before dissi\u0002pating such extreme natal NS spin angular momentum.\r
Second, our discussion has thus far neglected the pos\u0002sibility that the secondary component is an exotic com\u0002pact object, such as a boson star (Kaup 1968) or a\r
gravastar (Mazur & Mottola 2004), instead of a NS or a\r

The source of GW190814 represents a previously un\u0002detected class of coalescences that has the potential to\r
shed light on the formation of merging compact-object\r
binaries with highly asymmetric masses.\r
Electromagnetic observations of Galactic NSs and\r
stellar-mass BHs suggest a dearth of compact objects in\r
the ∼ 2.5 M\f to 5 M\f range (Bailyn et al. 1998; Ozel ¨\r
et al. 2010; Farr et al. 2011; Ozel et al. ¨ 2012). Observa\u0002tions of a few candidates with masses in this range seem\r
to disfavor the existence of a gap (Freire et al. 2008;\r
Neustroev et al. 2014; Giesers et al. 2018; Wyrzykowski\r
& Mandel 2020; Thompson et al. 2019), but whether the\r
mass gap is physical or caused by selection biases is still\r
a matter of debate (e.g., Kreidberg et al. 2012).\r
From a theoretical point of view, accurately calculat\u0002ing the masses of compact remnants at formation is chal\u0002lenging, because it depends on the complex physics of\r
the supernova explosion and the details of stellar evolu\u0002tion, especially for the late evolutionary stages of mas\u0002sive stars (Janka 2012; M¨uller 2016; Burrows et al. 2018;\r
Burrows et al. 2019). Whether the models favor the\r
presence of a gap or a smooth transition between NSs\r
and BHs is still unclear, and in fact some models have\r
been developed with the purpose of reproducing this\r
lower mass gap (Ugliano et al. 2012; Fryer et al. 2012;\r
Kochanek 2014; Sukhbold & Woosley 2014; Ertl et al.\r
2016). Therefore, our robust discovery of an object with\r
a well-constrained mass in this regime may provide cru\u0002cial constraints on compact-object formation models. In\r
fact, GW190814 demonstrates the need to adjust rem\u0002nant mass prescriptions previously designed to produce\r
a perceived mass gap. The combination of mass ratio\r
and component masses challenges most results obtained\r
from population synthesis simulations for isolated bina\u0002ries (Dominik et al. 2012, 2015; Marchant et al. 2017;\r
Giacobbo & Mapelli 2018; Mapelli & Giacobbo 2018;\r
Kruckow et al. 2018; Neijssel et al. 2019; Mapelli et al.\r
2019; Spera et al. 2019; Olejak et al. 2020) .\r
Population synthesis models distinguish between NSs\r
and BHs using only a mass threshold, which is gen\u0002erally in the range 2–3 M\f. Thus, depending on the\r
adopted threshold and on the adopted supernova explo\u0002sion model, a GW190814-like event may be labeled as\r
either a NSBH merger or a BBH merger. Most BBH\r
mergers have q > 0.5, while the distributions of merging\r
NSBH binaries suggest that systems with q . 0.1 may\r
be up to ∼ 103times less common than more symmet\u0002ric ones (q > 0.1) and that the mass-ratio distribution\r
peaks at q ≈ 0.2. Furthermore, models tend to favor\r
mergers of massive (& 1.3 M\f) NSs with relatively small\r
BHs (. 15 M\f) in environments with sub-solar metal\u0002licity (Z . 0.5Z\f). The tendency to disfavor mergers\r
with highly asymmetric masses in isolated binaries may\r
be the consequence of mass transfer (e.g., Postnov &\r
Yungelson 2014) and common envelope episodes (e.g.,\r
Ivanova et al. 2013) that cause systems with initially\r
asymmetric masses to evolve towards more symmetric\r
configurations. Overall, producing mergers with such\r
unequal masses, with a secondary in the perceived mass

14\r
gap, and at the rate implied by this discovery is a chal\u0002lenge for current models.\r
Nevertheless, particular choices of poorly constrained\r
assumptions within rapid population synthesis models\r
may increase the number of mergers with q . 0.1 so\r
that the latter may be only a few times less common\r
than (or even comparable to) systems with q ' 0.2 (e.g.,\r
Eldridge & Stanway 2016; Eldridge et al. 2017; Giacobbo\r
& Mapelli 2018).\r
Another possibility is that GW190814 is of dynami\u0002cal origin. Dynamical exchanges in dense stellar envi\u0002ronments tend to pair up massive compact objects with\r
similar masses (e.g., Sigurdsson & Hernquist 1993). This\r
process is effective for globular clusters, where compact\u0002object binaries may undergo tens of exchanges before\r
they get ejected from the cluster (Portegies Zwart &\r
McMillan 2000; Rodriguez et al. 2016; Park et al. 2017;\r
Askar et al. 2017; Rodriguez et al. 2019). For such envi\u0002ronments, models predict that most merging BBHs have\r
q ' 1 (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2016), and the formation\r
of NSBH binaries is highly suppressed because BHs dy\u0002namically dominate the cores over the complete lifetime\r
of the clusters, preventing the interactions between BHs\r
and NSs, with the consequence that the merger rate of\r
NSBH binaries in globular clusters in the local Universe\r
is ∼ 10−2–10−1 Gpc−3yr−1(Clausen et al. 2013; Ye et al.\r
2020; Arca Sedda 2020). The rate for GW190814-like\r
events, with a secondary in the perceived mass gap, is\r
likely even lower. In contrast, the NSBH merger rate\r
may be significantly higher in young star clusters (e.g.,\r
Ziosi et al. 2014) and the latter can effectively increase\r
the number of progenitors leading to merging compact\u0002object binaries with q . 0.15 (Di Carlo et al. 2019;\r
Rastello et al. 2020). Thus, young star clusters may\r
be promising hosts for GW190814-like events, but the\r
parameter space relevant for GW190814 is mostly unex\u0002plored in the context of star clusters.\r
In dense stellar environments, GW190814-like sys\u0002tems may also form from a low-mass merger remnant\r
that acquires a BH companion via dynamical interac\u0002tions (Gupta et al. 2020). Gupta et al. (2020) pre\u0002dicts a population of second-generation BHs in the 2.2–"""

assuming a double-Gaussian mass distribution for the\r
NSs. However, recent dynamical simulations of globular\r
clusters (e.g., Ye et al. 2020) find the subsequent merger\r
of such a second-generation BH with a larger stellar\u0002mass BH to be exceedingly rare. A high component spin\r
could be a distinguishing feature of a second-generation\r
compact object, but the uninformative spin posterior\r
for the lighter component of GW190814 provides no ev\u0002idence for or against this hypothesis.\r
A GW190814-like merger may also have originated\r
from a hierarchical triple in the field (e.g., Silsbee &\r
Tremaine 2017; Fragione & Loeb 2019; Antonini et al.\r
2017), from a wide hierarchical quadruple system (Sa\u0002farzadeh et al. 2020), or from hierarchical triples in\r
galactic centers, where the tertiary body is a supermas\u0002sive BH (Antonini & Perets 2012; Stephan et al. 2019;\r
Petrovich & Antonini 2017; Hoang et al. 2018; Fragione\r
et al. 2019). Specifically, Safarzadeh et al. (2020) ex\u0002plore the possibility that a second-generation remnant\r
with mass 3 M\f may merge with a 30 M\f BH, cat\u0002alyzed by a 50 M\f-BH perturber. The mass-ratio dis\u0002tributions of BBH and NSBH mergers from hierarchical\r
systems are similar to those of field binaries and it is\r
unclear whether hierarchies may enhance the formation\r
of merging compact-object binaries with highly asym\u0002metric masses (e.g., Silsbee & Tremaine 2017).\r
Disks of gas around supermassive BHs in active galac\u0002tic nuclei may be promising environments for the forma\u0002tion of GW190814-like systems. For such environments,\r
theoretical models show that merging compact-object\r
binaries with asymmetric masses are likely, but cannot\r
necessarily accommodate masses as low as the secondary\r
mass of GW190814 (e.g., Yang et al. 2019). However,\r
McKernan et al. (2020) show that the median mass ratio\r
of NSBH mergers in active galactic nucleus disks may be\r
as low as ∼ 0.07.\r
We conclude that the combination of masses, mass\r
ratio and inferred rate of GW190814 is challenging to\r
explain, but potentially consistent with multiple forma\u0002tion scenarios. However, it is not possible to assess the\r
validity of models that produce the right properties but\r
do not make quantitative predictions about formation\r
rates, even at some order-of-magnitude level.\r
Young star clusters and active galactic nucleus disks\r
seem to be more promising hosts for GW190814-like\r
mergers, since both these environments may enhance\r
the formation of either progenitors of or directly merg\u0002ing compact-object binaries with more asymmetric\r
masses to relevant rates. In contrast, globular-cluster\r
models provide more robust predictions, showing that\r
GW190814-like mergers with such asymmetric masses\r
are outliers in the population predictions, even though a\r
revision of the remnant-mass prescription is still needed.\r
Isolated binaries binaries could prove possible progeni\u0002tors provided similar revisions are implemented. The\r
importance of field multiples remains to be fully ex\u0002plored. Future gravitational-wave observations will pro\u0002vide further insights into the dominance of different\r
channels."""

gravitational-wave events can be used with measure\u0002ments of source redshifts in the electromagnetic spec\u0002trum to constrain cosmological parameters (Schutz\r
1986). Redshifts can be either obtained directly from\r
counterparts to the gravitational-wave source (Holz &\r
Hughes 2005), as was the case for GW170817 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2017a,b,e), by cross-correlation of the\r
gravitational-wave localization posterior with catalogs\r
of galaxy redshifts (Del Pozzo 2012; Nair et al. 2018;\r
Chen et al. 2018; Fishbach et al. 2019; Gray et al.\r
2020; Soares-Santos et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2019c),\r
by exploiting information in the neutron star equation\r
of state (Messenger & Read 2012), or by using the red\u0002shifted masses inferred from the gravitational wave ob\u0002servation and assumptions about the mass distribution\r
of the sources (Chernoff & Finn 1993; Taylor et al.\r
2012; Taylor & Gair 2012; Farr et al. 2019). At cur\u0002rent sensitivities, the cosmological parameter to which\r
LIGO–Virgo observations are most sensitive is the Hub\u0002ble constant, H0. The gravitational-wave observation\r
of GW170817 provided a posterior on H0 with mode\r
and 68.3% highest posterior density interval of H0 =\r
69+22\r
−8\r
km s−1 Mpc−1(Abbott et al. 2017e, 2019b,c),\r
assuming a flat prior on H0.\r
GW190814 is the best localized dark siren, i.e.,\r
gravitational-wave source without an electromagnetic\r
counterpart, observed to date, and so it is a good candi\u0002date for the statistical cross-correlation method. For a\r
fixed reference cosmology (Ade et al. 2016), the GLADE\r
galaxy catalog (D´alya et al. 2018) is approximately\r
40% complete at the distance of GW190814 and con\u0002tains 472 galaxies within the 90% posterior credible vol\u0002ume of GW190814. To obtain a constrain on H0, we\r
use the methodology described in Abbott et al. (2019c)\r
and the GLADE catalog. We take a flat prior for H0 ∈\r
[20, 140] km s−1 Mpc−1 and assign a probability to each\r
galaxy that it is the true host of the event that is pro\u0002portional to its B-band luminosity. Using the posterior\r
distribution on the distance obtained from the combined\r
PHM samples, we obtain H0 = 75+59\r
−13 km s−1Mpc−1\r
us\u0002ing GW190814 alone (mode and 68.3% highest posterior\r
density interval; the median and 90% symmetric credi\u0002ble interval is H0 = 83+55\r
−53 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
), which can be\r
compared to H0 = 75+40\r
−32 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
(Soares-Santos\r
et al. 2019) obtained using the dark siren GW170814\r
alone. The GW190814 result is the most precise mea\u0002surement from a single dark siren observation to date,\r
albeit comparable to the GW170814 result, which is\r
expected given GW190814’s small localization volume\r
(∼ 39000 Mpc3). The result is not very constraining,\r
with the 68.3% highest posterior density interval com\u0002prising 60% of the prior range. Combining the result for\r
GW190814 with the result obtained from GW170817, we\r
see an improvement over the GW170817-only result, to\r
H0 = 70+17\r
−8\r
km s−1 Mpc−1(the median and 90% sym\u0002metric credible interval is H0 = 77+33\r
−23 km s−1 Mpc−1\r
).\r
This result is not yet sufficiently constraining to pro\u0002vide further insight into current tensions in low and high\r
redshift measurements of the Hubble constant (Verde\r
et al. 2019), but these constraints will continue to im\u0002prove as further gravitational-wave observations are in\u0002cluded (e.g., projections in Chen et al. 2018; Vitale &\r

During their third observing run, on 2019 August 14,\r
21:10:39 UTC, the LIGO and Virgo detectors observed\r
GW190814, a novel source unlike any other known com\u0002pact binary coalescence. Thanks in part to the obser\u0002vation of significant power in subdominant multipoles\r
of the gravitational radiation, and the conclusive mea\u0002surement of little to no spin precession, we obtain pre\u0002cise measurements of its physical source properties that\r
clearly set it apart from other compact binaries.\r
In particular, (a) its mass ratio of q = 0.112+0.008\r
−0.009\r
is the most unequal ever observed with gravitational\r
waves, (b) the bound χ1 ≤ 0.07 on the spin of the\r
23.2\r
+1.1\r
−1.0 M\f BH is the strongest constraint on a primary\r
spin for any gravitational-wave source to date, and (c)\r
the secondary mass measurement of 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f makes\r
it the lightest BH or the heaviest NS discovered in a dou\u0002ble compact-object system. We find no evidence of mea\u0002surable tidal effects in the signal, and no electromagnetic\r
counterpart to the gravitational waves has been identi\u0002fied.\r
Comparisons between the secondary mass and sev\u0002eral current estimates of the maximum NS mass sug\u0002gest that GW190814 is unlikely to originate in a NSBH\r
coalescence. Nevertheless, the Mmax estimates are un\u0002certain enough that improved knowledge of the NS EOS\r
or further observations of the astrophysical population\r
of compact objects could alter this assessment. For this\r
reason, we cannot firmly exclude the possibility that the\r
secondary is a NS, nor can we be certain that it is a BH.\r
Regardless, this event sheds new light on the compact\u0002object mass distribution at the interface between known\r
NSs and BHs.\r
The unique combination of masses and inferred merger\r
rate for this event is difficult to produce in population\r
synthesis models of multi-component systems in galactic\r
fields or dense stellar environments. The discovery of\r
GW190814 may therefore reshape our understanding of\r
the processes by which the lightest BHs or the most

16\r
massive NSs form. Based on our rate density estimate,\r
we may reasonably expect to detect more systems of this\r
kind after a year at design sensitivity. This discovery\r
may prove to be the first hint of a larger population\r
that could change our perspective on the formation and\r
mass spectrum of compact objects.\r

interferometers, and samples from the posterior dis\u0002tributions for the source parameters, are available\r
