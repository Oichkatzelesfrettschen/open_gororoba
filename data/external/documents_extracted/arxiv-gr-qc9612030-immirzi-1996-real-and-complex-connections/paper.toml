I. INTRODUCTION\r
A lot of recent work in canonical quantum gravity is based on using as canonical variables\r
the pair (Eia, Ai\r
a\r
), where Eia is a triad of density weight one and Ai\r
a\r
a real SU(2) connection;\r
these variables were introduced by Barbero [1] as an alternative to the complex Ashtekar\r
variables [2]. For SU(2) to be the gauge group for general relativity we have to fix the local\r
inertial frames, choosing what is called ”time gauge”; once this choice is made, it will be\r
shown that there is a certain freedom in the choice of the connection, parametrized by a\r
variable β. No particular real real value of β has a geometric motivation, and any one gives\r
an acceptable, if somewhat bizarre, SU(2) connection. The choice β = i gives the Ashtekar\r
variables, requires that we impose reality conditions on the variables, but restores the full\r
invariance of the canonical theory under local Lorentz transformations; as an additional\r
benefit, this choice simplifies the expression of the hamiltonian constraint considerably.\r
The difference between these choices becomes important when we attempt to quantize the\r
theory. It is difficult to find a scalar product if the gauge group is SL(2, C), even in simplified\r
cases [3]. On the contrary, for gauge invariant functionals of a SU(2) connection, the metric\r
being well defined, one can study the spectrum of operators that can be interpreted as\r
representing the area of a surface and the volume of a region in space [4]; both these spectra\r
turn out to be discrete [5–8], indicating a discrete structure of space at the Planck scale.\r
Unfortunately, the arbitrary parameter β multiplies the scale of these spectra, and therefore\r
the results are meaningless unless we find a way to fix this constant. Since the constant\r
β appears explicitly in the expression of the Hamiltonian constraint, it may be that that\r
solutions to this constraint exist only for particular values, most likely β = 1. An alternative,\r
but strictly related possibility would be that β = 1 is required because it is the value for\r
which a rotation to the Ashtekar variables is possible [9,10], restoring the gauge group\r
SL(2, C). Both these goals have been attempted in recent work [11].\r
II. CONNECTIONS.\r
A canonical formulation of general relativity may be obtained starting from the action\r
S =\r

4κ\r
R\r
ǫIJKLe\r
I ∧eJ ∧RKL (where I, J, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, eI are vierbeins, RKL is the curvature\r
2–form of the Levi–Civita connection ΩIJ , and κ := (8πGNewton)/c3), then taking space slices\r
Σt: t(x) =const. with a vector t\r
a\r
: t\r
a∂at = 1 related to the unit normal to the slice na by\r
t\r
a = Nna + Na\r
, or na = −N∂at. If at this stage we partially fix the O(3, 1) gauge freedom\r
choosing ”time gauge”, i.e. setting:\r
e\r
0\r
a = −na = N∂at (1)\r
we are left with invariance under local O(3) transformations with e\r
ia, i = 1, 2, 3 space–like\r
providing a local frame on the slice and the inverse 3–metric q\r
ab = eiaeib. The pull–back\r
of ΩIJ to the space slice gives the 3–d Levi–Civita connection Γi\r
a\r

, and the\r
extrinsic curvature Ki\r
a\r

b\r
a Ω\r

b = e\r
ibKab. Instead of the A.D.M. variables (qab, πab :=\r
√q(Kab − q\r
abK)), we can take the pair [9]:\r
(E\r

j\r
b\r
e\r
k\r
c =\r

) (2)\r

From the definitions it follows that for small variations:\r
K\r
i\r
a\r
δEia =\r
1\r
2\r
√q\r
Kabδ(E\r
iaEi\r
) =\r

(πab −\r
1\r
2\r
π qab)δ(qqab) = −\r
1\r
2\r
π\r
ab δqab (3)\r
and therefore the only non vanishing Poisson-brackets are:\r
{K\r
i\r
a\r
(x), Ejb(y)} = κδb\r
a\r
δ\r
ijδ(x, y) (4)\r
With the connection Γi\r
a we can compute covariant derivatives Da and the curvature Riab,\r
and write the constraints of the theory in the form:\r
Gi:= ǫijkKj\r
aE\r
ka ≈ 0\r
Vc := qbc∇aπ\r
ab = 2Ea\r
i D[aKic] ≈ 0 (5)\r
H :=\r

[a\r
i E\r
b]\r
j Kj\r
aKib + ǫijkE\r
iaEjbRi\r
ab\u0011\r
≈ 0\r
The first constraint has been added to the A.D.M. ones to make sure that Kab is symmetrical.\r
The trouble with this formulation is that Γi\r
a\r
is a derived quantity, that can be expressed\r
in terms of E\r
ia, its derivatives and its inverse solving the 9 linear equations it satisfies:\r
DaE\r
ia = 0 ; ǫijkEa\r
i E\r
(b\r
j DaE\r
c)\r
k = 0 (6)\r
To obtain a connection that is in some sense a conjugate quantity to the triads we may\r
follow [1] and change our basic variables, for some β to be fixed, to:\r
(E\r
ia , A(β)i\r
a\r
:= Γi\r
a + β Kia\r
) (7)\r
By the properties of the Levi–Civita connection, we find:\r
E\r
ia δA(β)i\r
a = βEia δKia + E\r
ia δΓi\r
a =\r
= βEia δKi\r
a + ∂a(˜ǫ\r
abcek\r
b\r
δek\r
c\r
) (8)\r
so that the only non vanishing Poisson brackets are:\r
{A\r
(β)i\r
a\r
(x), Ejb(y)} = βκ δi\r
j\r
δ\r
b\r
a\r
δ(x, y) (9)\r
Unlike Ki\r
a\r
, A(β)i\r
a\r
transforms like an SU(2) connection for any β, so that one can have D(β)\r
a\r
derivatives, a curvature F\r
(β)i\r
ab , and for any path γ a ”transporters” gγ := P exp(R\r
τiA(β)i\r
a dγa\r
).\r
Geometrically, all this is perhaps a bit artificial: we are using a connection with torsion, and\r
we are smuggling the dynamics of the theory in this torsion.\r
With some algebra one finds that the constraints eq. (5) can be rewritten in the form:\r
3

D\r
(β)\r
a E\r
ia = βGi ≈ 0\r

where the dots are terms proportional to βGi and its derivatives.\r
Clearly, complications will come from the last constraint, in particular from its overall\r
factor 1/\r
q\r
det(E) and from the messy term proportional to (1 + β\r
2\r
). The quickest way to\r
get rid of it would be to take β = i, which is Ashtekar’s original choice [2](together with the\r
idea of absorbing the factor 1/\r
q\r
det(E) in the Lagrange multiplier). But this choice can be\r
motivated by much more than the simplification of the constraints: in fact for this value of\r
β the variables eq.(7) can be defined quite generally, without the gauge choice eq. (1), as the\r
pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual connection, and of the self–dual product of two\r
vierbeins:\r

the self–dual part, so that ǫ\r
KL\r
IJ C\r
i\r
KL = 2iCiIJ. This definition of the basic variables coincides\r
with eq. (2) if we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1), but we have to add to the constraints eq. (10)\r
the reality conditions:\r
E\r
iaEib = real ; ǫijkEa\r
i E\r
(b\r
j D\r
(i)\r
a E\r
c)\r
k = imaginary (13)\r
On the other hand, adopting this connection we retain the Lorentz group as gauge group of\r
the canonical theory1.\r
Because of the obvious complications of dealing with complex variables and with the non\u0002compact gauge group SL(2, C), the alternative choice β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”, has\r
been used in all the more recent work. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the second term of H\r
is proportional to (1 − β\r
2\r
), and the choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”natural”\r
for the (–+++) signature, but that is not particularly relevant, unless somehow we learn to\r
”Wick–rotate” the theory. Otherwise, there is no obvious geometric meaning, and nothing\r
special about the value β = 1, and and we can leave β arbitrary (but real > 0) in the\r
following.\r
One can also introduce a Poisson bracket preserving map on the algebra of functions on\r
phase space which, in a certain sense, allow us to change β. Following Thiemann [10], one\r
notices that\r
1\r
It is not often emphasized that the derivation of the Ashtekar variables does not require any\r
gauge fixing, but it is obvious from their original definitions; for ex. the alternative definition given\r
for Eia in eq.(12) is a direct transcription of eq.1.13b of [12]\r
4

T := Z\r
Σ\r
Ki\r
aE\r
iad3x (14)\r
from eq. (4) and the properties of Levi–Civita connections has the following Poisson brackets:\r
{T, Eia} = E\r
ia ; {T, Γi\r
a} = 0 ; {T, Kia} = −Kia\r
(15)\r
It follows that if we indicate the Hamiltonian evolution induced by some H on a function f\r
on phase space by the map:\r
WH(t) ◦ f := f + t{f, H} +\r
t\r
2\r
2!{{f, H}, H} + . . . (16)\r
we shall have:\r
WT (t) ◦ E\r
ia = e−tEia ; WT (t) ◦ A(β)i\r
a = Γia + βetKia\r
(17)\r
At a more speculative level, we can think of choosing t = iπ/2 and using this map to perform\r
a rotation from the β = 1 to the Ashtekar connection [10,9], similar to a ”Wick rotation”,\r
a possibility that is particularly exciting in the quantum case.\r
III. QUANTIZATION.\r
To quantize the theory we may use the connection representation, in which states are\r
functionals of A(β)i\r
a\r
(x), and\r
E\r
ia → Eˆia :=\r
βκh¯\r
i\r
δ\r
δA(β)i\r
a\r
(18)\r
The important states turn out to be ”spin net states”, which are an obvious generalization of\r
Wilson loops. Given a net n in 3–space with V vertices joined by (analytic) paths γ1, . . . , γL,\r
we assign: to each line an orientation, hence a ”transporter” gl, and a spin sl = 0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . .,\r
so that γl → Dsl\r
mm′(gl); to each vertex v an SU(2) invariant tensor C\r
v\r
ma,..,md\r
, in such a way\r
that:\r
ψn({gl}) = X\r
{m}\r
Y\r
v\r
C\r
v\r
... Y\r
l\r
D\r
sl\r
.. (gl) (19)\r
is gauge invariant. If gl ∈ SU(2), and we indicate by dgl the Haar measure, the ψn that we\r
can associate to a given net form a Hilbert space with the scalar product:\r
< ψn′|ψn >=\r
Z\r
ψn′ ψn\r
Y\r
dgl (20)\r
Ashtekar and collaborators have discovered (see e.g. [6]) that if one considers all possible\r
nets, then the set of these states is dense in the Hilbert space of gauge invariant functionals\r
of A(β). In this sense eq.(20) induces a measure DA(β)in this space. One can therefore\r
define a Rovelli–Smolin ”loop transform” [13], and focus on states which have support on\r
”weaves” [4], huge nets with mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length. In recent work\r
these states have been used to find the spectrum of the operators that correspond to the\r
5

area of a surface S and to the volume of a region R, and to investigate the operator form of\r
the constraints.\r
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset L of lines of the net, does not touch the\r
vertices, has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the operator (first taking the square\r
root, then removing the regulator), one finds :\r
Aˆ(S)ψn = : Z\r
s\r
d\r
2σ\r
q\r
nanbEˆiaEˆib : ψn =\r
= (βhκ¯ )\r
X\r
l∈L\r
q\r
sl(sl + 1) ψn (21)\r
This basic result has been extended in various directions, in particular to the volume operator\r
[5–8]. On the other hand, there is no known way to extend it to the theory based on the\r
Ashtekar connection: all operators seem to have the wrong hermiticity, whatever scalar\r
product we use.\r
However, it is clear from eq. (21) that the discrete spectra one gets for areas and volumes\r
cannot at this stage be interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of space, because of\r
the arbitrariness of β. The key ingredients we have used are the gauge invariance and the\r
commutation relations that correspond to the Poisson brackets eq. (9), and we must conclude\r
that by themselves they are not enough to fix the scale of the theory.\r
The quantization program requires therefore that we find some good reason to fix β. I\r
can imagine two ways in which this could happen. One could argue that a larger group\r
than SU(2) is necessary, as suggested for instance by the experience of current algebra,\r
and that one should insist on using the Ashtekar connection, overcoming the dificulties that\r
have been found; or that the states considered should be restricted by more than just gauge\r
invariance, in particular by the Hamiltonian constraint. In fact, it may well be that given\r
the way in which β enters eq. (10), the Wheeler De Witt equation H · ˆ Ψ = 0 will turn out\r
to have solutions only for particular values of β, a possibility that could be investigated in\r
Thiemann’s proposed realisation of Hˆ [11].\r
That these two ways may be related, or be the same, is indicated by another remarkable\r
Poisson bracket identity deduced by Thiemann:\r
(\r

)\r

δ(x, y) (22)\r
If at the quantum level we could handle the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume, and\r
translate this equation, we would be able to implement the ”Wick rotation” from the Barbero\r
to the Ashtekar connection representation.\r
At the same time, it is also important to establish whether the discreteness of areas and\r
volumes follows from the kinematics, which embody the equivalence principle, or requires\r
the Hamiltonian constraint, i.e. the Einstein equations: because the discreteness of areas\r
may be used to establish the proportionality between area and entropy [14], and this relation\r
can be used to derive the Einstein equations themselves, understood as equations of state\r
[15].\r

IV. CONCLUSION\r
We have seen that one can formulate canonical gravity as either a SL(2, C) or an SU(2)\r
connection theory, but that in the latter case an arbitrary parameter β occurs in the basic\r
Poisson brackets; at the same time, present mathematical technics can only cope with a\r
quantum theory based on the group SU(2). However, no meaningful result on the spectra\r
of operators can be obtained unless we either fix this parameter, or learn how to handle a\r
theory based on the group SL(2, C).\r

With the connection Γi\r

The first constraint has been added to the A.D.M. ones to make sure that Kab is symmetrical.\r
The trouble with this formulation is that Γi\r

in terms of E\r
ia, its derivatives and its inverse solving the 9 linear equations it satisfies:\r

To obtain a connection that is in some sense a conjugate quantity to the triads we may\r
follow [1] and change our basic variables, for some β to be fixed, to:\r
(E\r
ia , A(β)i\r
a\r
:= Γi\r
a + β Kia\r
) (7)\r
By the properties of the Levi–Civita connection, we find:\r
E\r

a = βEia δKia + E\r
ia δΓi\r
a =\r
= βEia δKi\r
a + ∂a(˜ǫ\r

so that the only non vanishing Poisson brackets are:\r
{A\r
(β)i\r
a\r
(x), Ejb(y)} = βκ δi\r
j\r
δ\r
b\r
a\r
δ(x, y) (9)\r
Unlike Ki\r
a\r
, A(β)i\r
a\r
transforms like an SU(2) connection for any β, so that one can have D(β)\r
a\r
derivatives, a curvature F\r
(β)i\r
ab , and for any path γ a ”transporters” gγ := P exp(R\r
τiA(β)i\r
a dγa\r
).\r
Geometrically, all this is perhaps a bit artificial: we are using a connection with torsion, and\r
we are smuggling the dynamics of the theory in this torsion.\r
With some algebra one finds that the constraints eq. (5) can be rewritten in the form:\r

Clearly, complications will come from the last constraint, in particular from its overall\r
factor 1/\r
q\r
det(E) and from the messy term proportional to (1 + β\r
2\r
). The quickest way to\r
get rid of it would be to take β = i, which is Ashtekar’s original choice [2](together with the\r
idea of absorbing the factor 1/\r
q\r
det(E) in the Lagrange multiplier). But this choice can be\r
motivated by much more than the simplification of the constraints: in fact for this value of\r
β the variables eq.(7) can be defined quite generally, without the gauge choice eq. (1), as the\r
pull–back to the space slice of the self–dual connection, and of the self–dual product of two\r

KL = 2iCiIJ. This definition of the basic variables coincides\r
with eq. (2) if we assume ”time gauge”, eq. (1), but we have to add to the constraints eq. (10)\r
the reality conditions:\r
E\r
iaEib = real ; ǫijkEa\r

k = imaginary (13)\r
On the other hand, adopting this connection we retain the Lorentz group as gauge group of\r
the canonical theory1.\r
Because of the obvious complications of dealing with complex variables and with the non\u0002compact gauge group SL(2, C), the alternative choice β = 1, the ”Barbero connection”, has\r
been used in all the more recent work. In Euclidean (++++) gravity the second term of H\r
is proportional to (1 − β\r
2\r
), and the choice β = 1 is natural, just like β = i was ”natural”\r
for the (–+++) signature, but that is not particularly relevant, unless somehow we learn to\r
”Wick–rotate” the theory. Otherwise, there is no obvious geometric meaning, and nothing\r
special about the value β = 1, and and we can leave β arbitrary (but real > 0) in the\r
following.\r
One can also introduce a Poisson bracket preserving map on the algebra of functions on\r
phase space which, in a certain sense, allow us to change β. Following Thiemann [10], one\r
notices that\r
1\r
It is not often emphasized that the derivation of the Ashtekar variables does not require any\r
gauge fixing, but it is obvious from their original definitions; for ex. the alternative definition given\r
for Eia in eq.(12) is a direct transcription of eq.1.13b of [12]"""

from eq. (4) and the properties of Levi–Civita connections has the following Poisson brackets:\r
{T, Eia} = E\r
ia ; {T, Γi\r
a} = 0 ; {T, Kia} = −Kia\r
(15)\r
It follows that if we indicate the Hamiltonian evolution induced by some H on a function f\r
on phase space by the map:\r
WH(t) ◦ f := f + t{f, H} +\r
t\r
2\r
2!{{f, H}, H} + . . . (16)\r
we shall have:\r
WT (t) ◦ E\r
ia = e−tEia ; WT (t) ◦ A(β)i\r
a = Γia + βetKia\r
(17)\r
At a more speculative level, we can think of choosing t = iπ/2 and using this map to perform\r
a rotation from the β = 1 to the Ashtekar connection [10,9], similar to a ”Wick rotation”,\r
a possibility that is particularly exciting in the quantum case.\r
III. QUANTIZATION.\r
To quantize the theory we may use the connection representation, in which states are\r
functionals of A(β)i\r
a\r
(x), and\r
E\r
ia → Eˆia :=\r
βκh¯\r
i\r
δ\r
δA(β)i\r
a\r
(18)\r
The important states turn out to be ”spin net states”, which are an obvious generalization of\r
Wilson loops. Given a net n in 3–space with V vertices joined by (analytic) paths γ1, . . . , γL,\r
we assign: to each line an orientation, hence a ”transporter” gl, and a spin sl = 0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . .,\r
so that γl → Dsl\r
mm′(gl); to each vertex v an SU(2) invariant tensor C\r
v\r
ma,..,md\r
, in such a way\r
that:\r
ψn({gl}) = X\r
{m}\r
Y\r
v\r
C\r
v\r
... Y\r
l\r
D\r
sl\r
.. (gl) (19)\r
is gauge invariant. If gl ∈ SU(2), and we indicate by dgl the Haar measure, the ψn that we\r
can associate to a given net form a Hilbert space with the scalar product:\r
< ψn′|ψn >=\r
Z\r
ψn′ ψn\r
Y\r
dgl (20)\r
Ashtekar and collaborators have discovered (see e.g. [6]) that if one considers all possible\r
nets, then the set of these states is dense in the Hilbert space of gauge invariant functionals\r
of A(β). In this sense eq.(20) induces a measure DA(β)in this space. One can therefore\r
define a Rovelli–Smolin ”loop transform” [13], and focus on states which have support on\r
”weaves” [4], huge nets with mesh sizes of the order of the Planck length. In recent work\r
these states have been used to find the spectrum of the operators that correspond to the\r
5

area of a surface S and to the volume of a region R, and to investigate the operator form of\r
the constraints.\r
Very briefly: if the surface S intersects a subset L of lines of the net, does not touch the\r
vertices, has no line lying on it, carefully regularizing the operator (first taking the square\r
root, then removing the regulator), one finds :\r
Aˆ(S)ψn = : Z\r
s\r
d\r
2σ\r
q\r
nanbEˆiaEˆib : ψn =\r
= (βhκ¯ )\r
X\r
l∈L\r
q\r
sl(sl + 1) ψn (21)\r
This basic result has been extended in various directions, in particular to the volume operator\r
[5–8]. On the other hand, there is no known way to extend it to the theory based on the\r
Ashtekar connection: all operators seem to have the wrong hermiticity, whatever scalar\r
product we use.\r
However, it is clear from eq. (21) that the discrete spectra one gets for areas and volumes\r
cannot at this stage be interpreted as evidence for a discrete structure of space, because of\r
the arbitrariness of β. The key ingredients we have used are the gauge invariance and the\r
commutation relations that correspond to the Poisson brackets eq. (9), and we must conclude\r
that by themselves they are not enough to fix the scale of the theory.\r
The quantization program requires therefore that we find some good reason to fix β. I\r
can imagine two ways in which this could happen. One could argue that a larger group\r
than SU(2) is necessary, as suggested for instance by the experience of current algebra,\r
and that one should insist on using the Ashtekar connection, overcoming the dificulties that\r
have been found; or that the states considered should be restricted by more than just gauge\r
invariance, in particular by the Hamiltonian constraint. In fact, it may well be that given\r
the way in which β enters eq. (10), the Wheeler De Witt equation H · ˆ Ψ = 0 will turn out\r
to have solutions only for particular values of β, a possibility that could be investigated in\r
Thiemann’s proposed realisation of Hˆ [11].\r
That these two ways may be related, or be the same, is indicated by another remarkable\r
Poisson bracket identity deduced by Thiemann:\r
(\r
ǫijk\r

δ(x, y) (22)\r
If at the quantum level we could handle the Hamiltonian constraint and the volume, and\r
translate this equation, we would be able to implement the ”Wick rotation” from the Barbero\r
to the Ashtekar connection representation.\r
At the same time, it is also important to establish whether the discreteness of areas and\r
volumes follows from the kinematics, which embody the equivalence principle, or requires\r
the Hamiltonian constraint, i.e. the Einstein equations: because the discreteness of areas\r
may be used to establish the proportionality between area and entropy [14], and this relation\r
can be used to derive the Einstein equations themselves, understood as equations of state\r
[15]."""

We have seen that one can formulate canonical gravity as either a SL(2, C) or an SU(2)\r
connection theory, but that in the latter case an arbitrary parameter β occurs in the basic\r
Poisson brackets; at the same time, present mathematical technics can only cope with a\r
quantum theory based on the group SU(2). However, no meaningful result on the spectra\r
of operators can be obtained unless we either fix this parameter, or learn how to handle a\r
theory based on the group SL(2, C).\r
