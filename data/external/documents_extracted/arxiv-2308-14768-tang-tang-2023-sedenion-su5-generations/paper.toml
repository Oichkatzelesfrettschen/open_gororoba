Abstract\r
In this work, we analyze two models beyond the Standard Model’s descriptions that make\r
ad hoc hypotheses of three point-like lepton and quark generations without explanations of their \r
physical origins. Instead of using the same Dirac equation involving four anti-commutative \r
matrices for all such structure-less elementary particles, we consider in the first model the use of\r
sixteen direct-product matrices of quaternions that are related to Dirac’s gamma matrices. This\r
associative direct-product matrix model could not generate three fermion generations satisfying \r
Einstein’s’ mass-energy relation. We show that sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion \r
sub-algebras and three octonion sub-algebras but with a common intersecting quaternion algebra. \r
This model naturally leads to precisely three generations as each of the non-associative octonion \r
sub-algebra leads to one fermion generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of basis sedenion \r
operators to construct twenty-four 5x5 generalized lambda matrices representing SU(5) generators, \r
in analogy to the use of octonion basis operators to construct Gell-Mann’s eight 3x3 lambda \r
matrices for SU(3) generators. Thus, this work links the sedenion algebra to Georgi-Glashaw’s \r
SU(5) Grand Unification Theory (GUT) that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions for \r
known Standard Model’s elementary particles. \r
Keywords: Standard Model, SU(5) GUT, sedenion, octonion, quarternion, direct-product \r
matrices

1. Introduction\r
The Dirac equation is the Standard Model's cornerstone for describing all fermionic \r
elementary particles [1-3]. According to the ad hoc assumptions, three generations of leptons and \r
quarks are point-like objects without a physical size [4-6]. However, such a long-held conceptual \r
picture of a point-like particle is inconsistent with observations. For example, why there exist \r
precisely three generations of leptons and quarks [7], and why could a point-like muon or tau be \r
much heavier than an electron [8, 9]. And, for the six types of point-like quarks, why are charm, \r
strange, top, and bottom quarks heavier than up and down quarks [10, 11]. In Dirac’s theory of a \r
relativistic electron, he coupled four 4x4 anti-commutative matrices \r
α1\r
, α2,α3,β\r
, or equivalently\r
  0 ,1 ,2 3\r
 ,  ,  ,  , to the 1st\r
-order derivatives in space and time to describe the wave [12, 13]. By \r
extending the operator techniques beyond Dirac’s theory, one can include additional operators in \r
a higher dimension to describe a particle’s internal degrees of freedom. In this work, we analyze \r
two types of higher dimensional generalization using the direct-product operators constructed from \r
Pauli’s matrices versus hyper-complex operators beyond quaternions [14-15] which is equivalent \r
to Dirac’s 4x4 gamma-matrices. Like the 4-element quaternion algebra with three anti\u0002commutative basis operators [16], the 8-element octonion algebra contains seven anti\u0002commutative basis operators, but unlike the associative quaternion algebra, the octonion algebra \r
is non-associative [17-20]. In this work, we will examine the corresponding multiplication rules \r
and compare their multiplication tables to clarify the similarities, differences, and the physical \r
implications. \r
In Sec. 2.1 we shall briefly review Dirac’s original model and its connection to the \r
quaternion algebra. In Sec. 2.2, we consider a higher dimensional model beyond Dirac’s use of\r
four anti-commutative gamma matrices. We analyze the group of 16 direct-product operators\r
constructed from quaternions or, equivalently, Pauli’s matrices and an identity operator, which are \r
related to 16 Dirac’s gamma. In Sec. 2.3, we discuss the non-associative 16-element sedenion \r
algebra [21-24], and show it is composed of three distinctive octonion algebras. We shall analyze \r
its differences from the direct-product case,and examine whether the corresponding mass-energy \r
relation is consistent with Einstein’s special relativity. In Sec. 2.5, we shall show how proper \r
operator assignment of the operators from three octonion sub-algebras can naturally lead to the \r
rise of three generations of lepton and quarks. Finally, in Sec. 2.6, we shall present a mapping of 

octonions to 8 SU(3) generators, and a mapping of sedenion operators to 24 generators for SU(5), \r
which was proposed by Geogi-Glashow [25,26] for their GUT model for grand unification of the \r
Standard Model’s elementary particles. \r
1. Theory\r
In this section, we present a theoretical analysis of an associative algebra model using \r
Dirac’s gamma matrices, which are related to direct-product operators which are constructed from \r
quaternions or equivalently Pauli’s matrices and an identity matrix, versus non-associative algebra \r
model based on octonion and sedenion operators. This work extends Dirac’s original theory for \r
the electron to three generations of leptons and quarks, and extends the Standard Model beyond \r
the ad hoc assumption of a point-like elementary fermions. We shall show that the sedenion \r
algebra provides a key link to SU(5) symmetry of GUT. This hyper-complex operator model with \r
higher degrees of freedom leads precisely to three generations of leptons/quarks which possess \r
internal structures.\r

The identity matrix and three Pauli matrices form the basis operators for 

quaternion algebra. Based on Dirac’s1st\r

Einstein’s relativistic mass-energy relation\r

  0 ,1 , 2 3\r

not satisfy the closure property, for example,\r
0 3\r

  = \r
does not belong to the same set,\r
therefore, these five operators do not form a group.\r
 In the Standard Model the same Dirac equation is used for all leptons and quarks, assuming \r
these particles are a point-like object with an infinitely small volume, it does not offer physical\r
explanations to exist precisely why there are three generations. To generalize Dirac equation to \r
higher dimensions, and to account for three fermion generations by incorporating internal \r
structural dynamics, we consider in the following sections two modelling approaches, i.e., an \r
direct-product matrix model of 16 associative 4x4 matrices versus non-associative hype-complex \r
algebra of 16 sedenion basis operators..\r

One can show that the eight-element set of direct-product operators \r
I, Γ1\r

form a group with the closure property for multiplication. Similarly, one can show that the other \r

and \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ3,W1, W2,W3\r
form a group for \r
multiplication. These direct-product operators can be related to the sixteen direct-product matrices \r
of quaternions. The multiplication table for the sixteen direct-product operators, which are related \r
to Dirac’s gamma matrices, is illustrated in Fig. 1. 

Figure 1. The color-coded multiplication table for 16 direct-product operators. Among the sixteen \r
operators, the 4-th, 8-th and 12-th operators are commutative with other operators although most \r
are anti-commutative. These properties differs from that of sedenion algebra. This 16-element \r
group contains three 8-element sub-groups with closure property for multiplication, namely, \r

due to a particle’s internal structural dynamics. Therefore, although the \r
16-element group of direct-product operator contains three 8-element subgroup, the above direct\u0002product model cannot represent three generations of leptons and quarks. In the following sections, \r
we will discuss the non-associative sedenion and octonion algebras, and show that they do not \r
encounter these problems facing the associative direct-product operator model. \r
2.3. Non-associative octonion algebra and one fermion generation

 We consider the octonion algebra to avoid the problems facing the direct-product matrix \r
model. Any element \r
x\r
and its conjugate \r
x\r
in the octonion algebra, xcan be expressed in terms \r
of the identity operator\r
0\r
e\r
and seven other octonion unit operators\r

where \r
k\r
e\r
satisfies the anti-commutative relation \r
  i j\r
i j\r
e , e =0,  for a different pair of indices. \r
These non-associative octonion operators follow the specific multiplication rules in Fig. 2.\r
Fig. 2. The color-coded multiplication table for the eight basis octonions. According to the \r
multiplication rules, other than the identity operator, all other seven operators anti-commute with \r
each other, however, the multiplications are not associative. The arrays are color-coded to illustrate \r
domains of cyclic multiplication rules for quaternions. Each color-coded domain of quaternion \r
triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules.\r
For the octonion algebra of Fig. 2, the 4th element anti-commutes with all other operators\r
except the identity operator. However, in Fig. 1 for the direct-product operators, the 4th element \r
a4\r
, a8or\r
a12\r
is commutative with all other operators, except the identity element. This property \r
is important for the corresponding mass-energy relation to be consistent with Einstein’s relativity.\r
Therefore, the model with seven non-associative but anti-commutative octonion operators is the \r
correct model to describe one generation of lepton or quark. The octonion model invokes three 

extra degrees of freedom to represent the internal structural dynamics of a fermion as three \r
momentum components with respect to the center-of-mass reference frame, whereas the other \r
three anti-commutative operators represent the external degrees of freedom as three momentum \r
operators for the particle with respect to the laboratory frame.\r
2.4. Three octonion sub-algebras in sedenion algebra and three generations of\r
charged/neutral leptons\r
In the last section, we explain that the octonion algebra leads to only one fermion \r
generation. To accommodate three generations, one needs to consider higher-dimensional \r
hypercomplex algebra, namely, the sedenion algebra. In the sedenion algebra, it consists of 16 \r
basis ssedenion operators \r
ek\r
, k =0,1,2,...,15\r
, denoted as \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ1,U1, U2,U3,Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
,, Θ3,W1, W2,W3\r
sequentially. \r
The multiplication rules for 16 sedenion basis operators are given in Fig. 3, and is different from \r
the table for the direct-product operator model shown earlier in Fig. 31\r
Fig. 3. The color-coded multiplication table for16 basis sedenion operators \r
ek\r
, k =0,1,2,...,15 . \r
The region algebra contains three distinct types of octonion sub-algebras, denoted by \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ1,U1, U2,U3,I, Γ1,Γ2,Γ3, Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
and \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ3,W1, W2,W3 . Each 

color-coded domain containing quaternion triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules. Unlike the \r
table in Fig. 1 for the associative direct-product matrices, the 4-th, 8-th and 12-th operators in the \r
non-associative sedenion algebra anti-commutes with \r
U, V,W\r
operators. \r
The multiplication table in Fig. 3 can be rearranged in order to become Fig. 4 to illustrate \r
that the sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion algebras with each quaternion algebra \r
representing a distinct type of SU(2) spinors with a cyclic multiplication rule. \r

SU(2) spinors, U, V, W,   wich each type following a cyclic multiplication rule. Each type \r
of spinor triad together with an unit operator forms a quaternion algebra. \r
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the sedenion algebra contains three distinct types of octonion \r
algebra, which are denoted by\r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ1\r
,U1, U2,U3, I, Γ1\r

and \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ3,W1, W2,W3.\r
The multiplication tables for these three distinct types of octonion algebra are illustrated in Fig. \r

2.6. Mapping octonions to SU(3) generators and sedenion to SU(5) generators

In this section, we discuss the mapping of the octonion operators to 8 SU(3) generators and \r
the mapping of sedenion operators to 24 SU(5) generators. For each type of octonion algebra, one\r
can show its isomorphism to Clifford algebra𝐶ℓ(6) [20]. Here, we define three pairs of fermion \r
creation and annihilation operators \r

and \r

 which satisfy the anti-commutation relations as \r

We have shown above the eight lambda matrices as the SU(3) generators which can be \r
constructed from \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3,Θ1,U1,U2,U3 . Because the sedenion algebra is shown to consist \r
of three octonion sub-algebras. Similarly, one can use two other octonion basis sets, i.e., \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
and \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ3,W1, W2,W3\r
to construct two other lambda-matrix \r
generators. Together with the U-type, V-type and W-type octonion algebras which are the three \r
distinct sub-algebra of the sedenion algebra, we can construct all together 24 generators for SU(5). 

By extending the three pairs of creation and annihilation and creation operators for the \r
octonion algebra, we define five pairs of fermion creation and annihilation operators for the \r
sedenion algebra as\r

(11B)\r
Similar to Eq. (10C) by constructing eight of 3x3 lambda matrices for the SU(3) generators from \r
three pairs of creation and annihilation operators, one can construct from five pairs of fermion[c\r
creation and annihilation operators, a total of twenty-four generalized lambda matrices as the \r
SU(5) generators. Using the five pairs of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , one can \r
construct 10 pairs of 5x5 off-diagonal SU(5) generator matrices as \r
m n + n m , − i m n +i n m ,\r
for \r
mn=1,2,..,5.\r
And, with the same indices one can construct \r
four off-diagonal but orthogonal 5x5 matrices. Therefore, among these twenty-four SU(5) \r
generators which can be represented by 5x5 generalized lambda matrices, there are four diagonal \r
matrices and twenty off-diagonal matrices. The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential role in the \r
GUT (grand unification theory) that has been advocated to unify the electromagnetic, weak and \r
strong interactions among elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion \r
algebra are not totally independent of each other because they contain the same quaternion algebra \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3\r
. Such an intersection among three octonion sub-algebras underlies the quark \r
confinement mechanism. The cooling after the big bang of the universe plays an important role in \r
symmetry breaking of SU(5) to become SU(3)\r
\r
SU(2)\r
\r
U(1) , and the break sown of the \r
sedenion algebra into direct-product of octonion and quaternion algebras. Such breakdown results \r
in flavor mixing of neutrinos and their mass oscillations. \r
3. Conclusions 

 In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of higher dimensional models beyond the \r
conventional Dirac model for a point-like fermion without a volume or an internal structure. Dirac \r
utilized four anti-commutative matrices to couple to the first derivative of particle’s space and time \r
coordinates. Such an extension is necessary, because the traditional Dirac theory cannot explain \r
the origins for the observed three generations of leptons and quarks postulated in the Standard \r
Model. We first consider an 16-element group of 4x4 matrices as direct products of quaternion \r
operators, i.e., three 2x2 Pauli’s matrices and an identity matrix. This model contains three extra \r
degrees of freedom to incorporate a particle’s internal structure. This 16-element group contains \r
three 8-element subgroups, possessing a closure property for multiplications among eight elements \r
of each subgroup. However, this direct-product matrix model with associative operators could not \r
reproduce Einstein’s mass-energy relation, in contrast to the model with 16 sedenion basis \r
operators. The significant difference between the two models is the associativity of whether \r
multiplication is associative or not, as clearly illustrated from the differences in the multiplication \r
tables of Figs. 1 and 2. The 8-element octonion algebra is shown to be able to lead to one lepton \r
generation, however, we need 16-element sedenion algebra to encompass precisely three \r
generation of leptons and quarks. We have shown from the color-code table arrays in Fig. 2, the \r
sedenion algebra contains three distinct octonion algebras, with the U, V, and W-type operators,\r
and each type of octonion sub-algebra corresponding to one generation. We have also shown for \r
neutrinos that from Eq. (7) the effective rest mass could be vanishingly small in comparison to that\r
in Eq. (6) for the counterpart charged leptons. We have also provided operator assignments in \r
Equations (8) and (9) to represent three generations of lighter and heavier quarks. Moreover, we \r
have shown that by properly pairing up the octonion basis operators one an construct 8 3x3 Gell\u0002Mann’s lambda matrices as the 8 generators for SU(3). For the U, V and W-type octonion sub\u0002algebra of the sedenion algebra, we could pair up the sedenion basis operators to construct a total \r
of 24 5x5 matrices to represent the 24 generators of SU(5). The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential \r
role in the GUT that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions among the Standard Model’s \r
elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion algebra contain the same \r
quaternions\r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3\r
, and such an intersection underlies the quark confinement mechanism.\r
Soon after the big bang of the universe, its cooling plays an important role in symmetry breaking \r
for SU(5) to be broken down to become SU(3)\r
\r
SU(2)\r
\r
U(1) [25, 26], and the broken sedenion 

algebra into direct-product algebra of octonions and quaternions results in flavor mixing of \r
neutrinos to induce the mass oscillation behavior. \r

Abstract\r
In this work, we analyze two models beyond the Standard Model’s descriptions that make\r
ad hoc hypotheses of three point-like lepton and quark generations without explanations of their \r
physical origins. Instead of using the same Dirac equation involving four anti-commutative \r
matrices for all such structure-less elementary particles, we consider in the first model the use of\r
sixteen direct-product matrices of quaternions that are related to Dirac’s gamma matrices. This\r
associative direct-product matrix model could not generate three fermion generations satisfying \r
Einstein’s’ mass-energy relation. We show that sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion \r
sub-algebras and three octonion sub-algebras but with a common intersecting quaternion algebra. \r
This model naturally leads to precisely three generations as each of the non-associative octonion \r
sub-algebra leads to one fermion generation. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of basis sedenion \r
operators to construct twenty-four 5x5 generalized lambda matrices representing SU(5) generators, \r
in analogy to the use of octonion basis operators to construct Gell-Mann’s eight 3x3 lambda \r
matrices for SU(3) generators. Thus, this work links the sedenion algebra to Georgi-Glashaw’s \r
SU(5) Grand Unification Theory (GUT) that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions for \r
known Standard Model’s elementary particles. \r

The Dirac equation is the Standard Model's cornerstone for describing all fermionic \r
elementary particles [1-3]. According to the ad hoc assumptions, three generations of leptons and \r
quarks are point-like objects without a physical size [4-6]. However, such a long-held conceptual \r
picture of a point-like particle is inconsistent with observations. For example, why there exist \r
precisely three generations of leptons and quarks [7], and why could a point-like muon or tau be \r
much heavier than an electron [8, 9]. And, for the six types of point-like quarks, why are charm, \r
strange, top, and bottom quarks heavier than up and down quarks [10, 11]. In Dirac’s theory of a \r
relativistic electron, he coupled four 4x4 anti-commutative matrices \r
α1\r
, α2,α3,β\r
, or equivalently\r
  0 ,1 ,2 3\r
 ,  ,  ,  , to the 1st\r
-order derivatives in space and time to describe the wave [12, 13]. By \r
extending the operator techniques beyond Dirac’s theory, one can include additional operators in \r
a higher dimension to describe a particle’s internal degrees of freedom. In this work, we analyze \r
two types of higher dimensional generalization using the direct-product operators constructed from \r
Pauli’s matrices versus hyper-complex operators beyond quaternions [14-15] which is equivalent \r
to Dirac’s 4x4 gamma-matrices. Like the 4-element quaternion algebra with three anti\u0002commutative basis operators [16], the 8-element octonion algebra contains seven anti\u0002commutative basis operators, but unlike the associative quaternion algebra, the octonion algebra \r
is non-associative [17-20]. In this work, we will examine the corresponding multiplication rules \r
and compare their multiplication tables to clarify the similarities, differences, and the physical \r
implications. \r
In Sec. 2.1 we shall briefly review Dirac’s original model and its connection to the \r
quaternion algebra. In Sec. 2.2, we consider a higher dimensional model beyond Dirac’s use of\r
four anti-commutative gamma matrices. We analyze the group of 16 direct-product operators\r
constructed from quaternions or, equivalently, Pauli’s matrices and an identity operator, which are \r
related to 16 Dirac’s gamma. In Sec. 2.3, we discuss the non-associative 16-element sedenion \r
algebra [21-24], and show it is composed of three distinctive octonion algebras. We shall analyze \r
its differences from the direct-product case,and examine whether the corresponding mass-energy \r
relation is consistent with Einstein’s special relativity. In Sec. 2.5, we shall show how proper \r
operator assignment of the operators from three octonion sub-algebras can naturally lead to the \r
rise of three generations of lepton and quarks. Finally, in Sec. 2.6, we shall present a mapping of 

octonions to 8 SU(3) generators, and a mapping of sedenion operators to 24 generators for SU(5), \r
which was proposed by Geogi-Glashow [25,26] for their GUT model for grand unification of the \r
Standard Model’s elementary particles."""

In the last section, we explain that the octonion algebra leads to only one fermion \r
generation. To accommodate three generations, one needs to consider higher-dimensional \r
hypercomplex algebra, namely, the sedenion algebra. In the sedenion algebra, it consists of 16 \r
basis ssedenion operators \r
ek\r
, k =0,1,2,...,15\r
, denoted as \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ1,U1, U2,U3,Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
,, Θ3,W1, W2,W3\r
sequentially. \r
The multiplication rules for 16 sedenion basis operators are given in Fig. 3, and is different from \r
the table for the direct-product operator model shown earlier in Fig. 31\r
Fig. 3. The color-coded multiplication table for16 basis sedenion operators \r
ek\r
, k =0,1,2,...,15 . \r
The region algebra contains three distinct types of octonion sub-algebras, denoted by \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ1,U1, U2,U3,I, Γ1,Γ2,Γ3, Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
and \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ3,W1, W2,W3 . Each 

color-coded domain containing quaternion triplets follows cyclic multiplication rules. Unlike the \r
table in Fig. 1 for the associative direct-product matrices, the 4-th, 8-th and 12-th operators in the \r
non-associative sedenion algebra anti-commutes with \r
U, V,W\r
operators. \r
The multiplication table in Fig. 3 can be rearranged in order to become Fig. 4 to illustrate \r
that the sedenion algebra contains five distinct quaternion algebras with each quaternion algebra \r
representing a distinct type of SU(2) spinors with a cyclic multiplication rule. \r

SU(2) spinors, U, V, W,   wich each type following a cyclic multiplication rule. Each type \r
of spinor triad together with an unit operator forms a quaternion algebra. \r
As can be seen from Fig. 3, the sedenion algebra contains three distinct types of octonion \r
algebra, which are denoted by\r
I, Γ1\r

We have shown above the eight lambda matrices as the SU(3) generators which can be \r
constructed from \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3,Θ1,U1,U2,U3 . Because the sedenion algebra is shown to consist \r
of three octonion sub-algebras. Similarly, one can use two other octonion basis sets, i.e., \r
I, Γ1\r
,Γ2,Γ3, Θ2,V1, V2,V3\r
and \r
I, Γ1\r

generators. Together with the U-type, V-type and W-type octonion algebras which are the three \r
distinct sub-algebra of the sedenion algebra, we can construct all together 24 generators for SU(5). 

By extending the three pairs of creation and annihilation and creation operators for the \r
octonion algebra, we define five pairs of fermion creation and annihilation operators for the \r
sedenion algebra as\r

Similar to Eq. (10C) by constructing eight of 3x3 lambda matrices for the SU(3) generators from \r
three pairs of creation and annihilation operators, one can construct from five pairs of fermion[c\r
creation and annihilation operators, a total of twenty-four generalized lambda matrices as the \r
SU(5) generators. Using the five pairs of fermionic creation and annihilation operators , one can \r
construct 10 pairs of 5x5 off-diagonal SU(5) generator matrices as \r
m n + n m , − i m n +i n m ,\r
for \r
mn=1,2,..,5.\r
And, with the same indices one can construct \r
four off-diagonal but orthogonal 5x5 matrices. Therefore, among these twenty-four SU(5) \r
generators which can be represented by 5x5 generalized lambda matrices, there are four diagonal \r
matrices and twenty off-diagonal matrices. The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential role in the \r
GUT (grand unification theory) that has been advocated to unify the electromagnetic, weak and \r
strong interactions among elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion \r
algebra are not totally independent of each other because they contain the same quaternion algebra \r
I, Γ1\r

In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of higher dimensional models beyond the \r
conventional Dirac model for a point-like fermion without a volume or an internal structure. Dirac \r
utilized four anti-commutative matrices to couple to the first derivative of particle’s space and time \r
coordinates. Such an extension is necessary, because the traditional Dirac theory cannot explain \r
the origins for the observed three generations of leptons and quarks postulated in the Standard \r
Model. We first consider an 16-element group of 4x4 matrices as direct products of quaternion \r
operators, i.e., three 2x2 Pauli’s matrices and an identity matrix. This model contains three extra \r
degrees of freedom to incorporate a particle’s internal structure. This 16-element group contains \r
three 8-element subgroups, possessing a closure property for multiplications among eight elements \r
of each subgroup. However, this direct-product matrix model with associative operators could not \r
reproduce Einstein’s mass-energy relation, in contrast to the model with 16 sedenion basis \r
operators. The significant difference between the two models is the associativity of whether \r
multiplication is associative or not, as clearly illustrated from the differences in the multiplication \r
tables of Figs. 1 and 2. The 8-element octonion algebra is shown to be able to lead to one lepton \r
generation, however, we need 16-element sedenion algebra to encompass precisely three \r
generation of leptons and quarks. We have shown from the color-code table arrays in Fig. 2, the \r
sedenion algebra contains three distinct octonion algebras, with the U, V, and W-type operators,\r
and each type of octonion sub-algebra corresponding to one generation. We have also shown for \r
neutrinos that from Eq. (7) the effective rest mass could be vanishingly small in comparison to that\r
in Eq. (6) for the counterpart charged leptons. We have also provided operator assignments in \r
Equations (8) and (9) to represent three generations of lighter and heavier quarks. Moreover, we \r
have shown that by properly pairing up the octonion basis operators one an construct 8 3x3 Gell\u0002Mann’s lambda matrices as the 8 generators for SU(3). For the U, V and W-type octonion sub\u0002algebra of the sedenion algebra, we could pair up the sedenion basis operators to construct a total \r
of 24 5x5 matrices to represent the 24 generators of SU(5). The SU(5) symmetry plays an essential \r
role in the GUT that unifies the electroweak and strong interactions among the Standard Model’s \r
elementary particles. These three types of the 8-element octonion algebra contain the same \r
quaternions\r

, and such an intersection underlies the quark confinement mechanism.\r
Soon after the big bang of the universe, its cooling plays an important role in symmetry breaking \r
