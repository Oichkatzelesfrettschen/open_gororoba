The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimen\u0002sionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the\r
vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all\r
length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated\r
systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from di\u0002verging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body\r
systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we\r
employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic\r
scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method\r
accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the\r
efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a\r
quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entan\u0002glement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of\r
subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement\r
highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems\r
on quantum computers.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
In physics and materials science, universality ap\u0002pears near continuous phase transitions, where long\u0002range properties become independent of microscopic de\u0002tails, and the singular behavior of physical quantities\r
such as susceptibilities and correlation lengths can be\r
characterized by universal critical exponents. While clas\u0002sical phase transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations,\r
quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature\r
when a system parameter is varied, causing the ground\r
state to become highly entangled due to quantum fluc\u0002tuations [1, 2]. This groundstate non-locality presents\r
challenges for theoretical and experimental analysis.\r
Rapid advancements on controlled quantum platforms\r
have expanded the range of experimentally accessible\r
quantum many-body systems on quantum simulators and\r
computers [3–10]. Previous studies [11–18] have made\r
significant progress in the experimental characterization\r
of entanglement. However, probing entanglement prop\u0002erties across quantum phase transitions remains difficult.\r
Analog quantum simulators have limited control, re\u0002stricting available models and measurements [19]. Quan\u0002tum simulations using quantum computers face chal\u0002lenges including: (i) Limited number of qubits: Quantum\r
phase transitions formally occur only in infinite systems,\r
∗ thomas.barthel@duke.edu\r
† marko.cetina@duke.edu\r
and finite-size effects are pronounced in the vicinity of\r
critical points. Preparing critical ground states directly\r
requires more qubits than current quantum devices offer.\r
(ii) Exponential cost for probing subsystem entanglement:\r
Resolving detailed entanglement structures requires state\r
tomography for large subsystems, which generally results\r
in exponential costs. (iii) Difficulties in state prepara\u0002tion: Without deeper insight into the physics, the study\r
of complex many-body ground states necessitates highly\r
expressive quantum circuits with many gates, leading to\r
low trainability [20, 21] and significant error accumula\u0002tion.\r
We overcome these challenges for condensed-matter\r
ground states using highly structured quantum cir\u0002cuits on a digital quantum computer. The cir\u0002cuits prepare states corresponding to hierarchical tensor\r
networks—the multiscale entanglement renormalization\r
ansatz (MERA) [22–24]. This ansatz can represent in\u0002finite systems and accurately encodes long-range corre\u0002lations, even at critical points. The causal structure of\r
MERA, inspired by the real-space renormalization group,\r
drastically reduces circuit depths and the number of mea\u0002sured qubits, both scaling logarithmically with system\r
size [25–28]. This allows efficient extraction of local\r
observables, subsystem entanglement, and entanglement\r
spectra. Additionally, MERA is robust to noise [29] and\r
not affected by barren plateaus [30, 31].\r
In this work, we study quantum many-body ground\r
states on a digital quantum computer based on a chain of\r
ytterbium ions. We demonstrate a quantum phase tran\u0002arXiv:2412.18602v3 [quant-ph] 24 Aug 2025

FIG. 1. MERA on a trapped-ion chain. (a) An infinite,\r
binary 1D MERA with three homogeneous layers. The ansatz\r
is prepared from top to bottom, with each layer comprising\r
entangling gates (bare rectangles) and isometries (rectangles\r
with attached circles) that double the number of sites. The\r
output is the many-body state on the physical spin sites.\r
Repeating the MERA circuit horizontally in the spatial di\u0002mension generates a state in the thermodynamic limit. Lo\u0002cal observables and bipartite entanglement can be studied\r
by executing circuits within the corresponding causal cone\r
(unshaded area) and measuring the target qubits. (b) Each\r

sition characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking\r
in the thermodynamic limit, using 12 or fewer qubits. We\r
show the universal scaling of relevant physical quantities\r
near the transition and observe significant changes in the\r
entanglement structure across the critical point. At the\r
critical point, we find that the subsystem entanglement\r
entropies follow a universal log-area law, and the gap of\r
the entanglement Hamiltonian closes as the subsystem\r
size increases. In non-critical regimes, subsystem entan\u0002glement entropy follows an area law [32–34]. The mea\u0002sured entanglement Hamiltonian remains gapped with\r
increasing subsystem size and accurately reproduces ex\u0002pected symmetry properties.\r
II. SETUP\r
Preparing ground states of many-body systems with\r
long-range quantum fluctuations is challenging. This can\r
be mitigated by accounting for the system’s entanglement\r
structure. To approximate the ground state |Ψ⟩ in the\r
thermodynamic limit, we implement MERA on a digital\r
ion-trap quantum computer.\r
A. MERA circuits\r
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the layered structure of MERA\r
tensor networks introduces an additional dimension asso\u0002ciated with a hierarchy of length and energy scales. The\r
MERA comprises T layers, each composed of unitary\r
(dis)entanglers and isometries, which can be efficiently\r
implemented on our hardware. Viewed from bottom to\r
top, starting from the physical layer, MERA acts as a\r
renormalization group (RG) flow, where the ascending\r
layer index represents the RG scale. In each renormal\u0002ization step, short-distance entanglement is removed by\r
the disentanglers (bare rectangles), and the isometries\r
(rectangles with attached circles) then coarse-grain the\r
system. This process maps physical sites to renormal\u0002ized effective degrees of freedom, continuing until the\r
final layer T ∼ log ξ is reached, where ξ is the largest\r
correlation length in the system.\r
Viewed in reverse (the direction of decreasing layer in\u0002dex), the MERA represents a quantum circuit, which\r
prepares the quantum state by first generating long\u0002range correlations associated with low-energy modes, and\r
then progressively incorporating shorter-range correla\u0002tions that correspond to higher energy scales. For each\r
layer, ancillary qubits initialized in the |0⟩ state (depicted\r
as circles) are injected and entangled with existing qubits\r
through unitary operations. Each unitary tensor consists\r
of two-qubit entangling gates and single-qubit rotations,\r
as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).\r
B. Observables and holographic subsystem\r
tomography\r
Local observables can be studied by implementing only\r
the associated causal-cone circuits. For measurements on\r
sites 0 and 1 of a binary one-dimensional (1D) MERA,\r
the corresponding reduced circuit is indicated by the non\u0002shaded MERA tensors in Fig. 1(a). Due to their isomet\u0002ric properties, the shaded tensors outside the causal cone\r
do not influence the local measurements.\r
Entanglement entropies and spectra for a spatial bipar\u0002tition of the system into parts A and B can be obtained\r
from the reduced density matrix ˆϱB = TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|. For\r
a MERA, only the gates within the causal cone of the\r
boundary between A and B need to be implemented, as\r
gates outside the causal cone correspond to unitary basis\r
transformations UˆA and UˆB in the two subsystems and\r
do not affect bipartite entanglement properties. More\u0002over, tomography on the renormalized sites (qubits) at\r
the edges of A’s causal cone provides access to ˆϱB in the\r
basis defined by UˆB. Thus, due to the causal structure\r
of MERA, the number of gates and number of measured\r
qubits are proportional to the number of layers T ∼ log ξ,\r
rather than the total system size and subsystem size,

3\r
respectively. Details of our scheme, termed holographic\r
subsystem tomography, are described in Appendix A.\r
In the experiment, we implement an infinite, homoge\u0002neous, binary 1D MERA with bond dimension χ = 2\r
and up to T = 5 layers, which captures a maximum cor\u0002relation range of 3 × 2\r
5 = 96 sites. To this purpose,\r
all tensors of the same color in Fig. 1(a) are chosen to\r
be identical, and the shown tensor network structure is\r
continued horizontally ad infinitum. For the self-similar\r
critical systems, the correlation length ξ diverges, which\r
we address by employing a scale-invariant MERA [35, 36]\r
as discussed in Sec. III B 2 and Appendix C.\r
C. Trapped-ion system\r
We implement MERA circuits on a digital ion-trap\r
quantum computer. Our experimental system consists\r
of a linear chain of fifteen 171Yb+ ions, spaced by ap\u0002proximately 3.7 µm, confined in a micro-fabricated Paul\r
trap (Sandia HOA-2.1.1 [37]) held in a room-temperature\r
vacuum chamber. The qubits are encoded in the hyper\u0002fine “clock” states of the ground 2S1/2 electronic manifold\r
as |0⟩ ≡ |F = 0; mF = 0⟩ and |1⟩ ≡ |F = 1; mF = 0⟩,\r
where F is the total atomic angular momentum and mF\r
its projection onto the direction of the magnetic field,\r
with a magnitude of 3.2 G. Qubits are initialized in the\r
|0⟩ state using optical pumping and measured by state\u0002dependent fluorescence on the 369 nm D1 line.\r
The qubits are manipulated via a Raman process us\u0002ing a wide (300 µm×30 µm) linearly-polarized global\u0002addressing beam and equispaced, linearly-polarized\r
1 µm-diameter individual-addressing beams derived from\r
the same 355-nm pulsed laser (Coherent Paladin Com\u0002pact 355-4000). Radio-frequency (rf) gate waveforms\r
are produced by an rf system on a chip (ZCU111\r
from Xilinx Corp.) controlled by the Sandia Octet\r
firmware [38] and separately modulated onto each laser\r
beam using acousto-optic modulators (L3 Harris Corp.).\r
Available single-qubit operations are virtual z-axis ro\u0002tations Rz(θ), implemented via phase offsets in the\r
radio-frequency controls, and physical xy-plane rota\u0002tions R(θ, ϕ) = e−iθ(Xˆ cos ϕ+Yˆ sin ϕ)/2\r
. Entangling gates\r
XX(θ) = e−iθXˆi⊗Xˆj /2 between arbitrary qubits i and\r
j are realized through a Mølmer-Sørensen interaction\r
mediated by the shared radial motional modes of the\r
ion chain with mode frequencies near 3 MHz. This in\u0002teraction is implemented by amplitude-shaping a state\u0002dependent force on the addressed ions using the 355-nm\r
Raman process.\r
The all-to-all qubit connectivity of our platform simpli\u0002fies the implementation of the non-local MERA circuits.\r
Using a detailed error model discussed in Appendix E, we\r
optimize ion-to-qubit mappings for each MERA circuit;\r
see Fig. 1(d).\r
III. RESULTS\r
To demonstrate the potential of the MERA approach,\r
we apply it to the 1D transverse-field Ising model (TFIM)\r
described by the Hamiltonian\r

Here, Xˆ\r
i and Zˆi are Pauli operators acting on the spin\r
at lattice site i, and g is the transverse magnetic field.\r
The TFIM features a well-characterized continuous quan\u0002tum phase transition with spontaneous Z2 symmetry\u0002breaking, making it a good testbed for our approach.\r
Since the 1D binary MERA with small bond dimension\r
is classically simulable, we determine the optimal gate pa\u0002rameters of the variational MERA circuit using classical\r
computers. The gate compilation of the tensors and a\r
concrete circuit example are discussed in Appendix D.\r
A. Quantum phase transition\r
We benchmark the infinite MERA across the quantum\r
phase transition of the TFIM (1) by first measuring local\r
observables ⟨Oˆ\r
i⟩. We prepare the causal-cone state of\r
the target spins as indicated in Fig. 1. The number T\r
of employed MERA layers ranges from 2 to 5, depending\r
on the correlation length; T = 2 layers are used far from\r
criticality and up to 5 layers near the critical point g = 1.\r
Correspondingly, the number of required qubits ranges\r
from 6 to 12.\r
Figure 2(a) shows the measured magnetization ⟨Xˆ⟩ in\r
the x-direction as a function of the z-field g, nicely re\u0002solving the phase transition. For g > 1, the observed\r
magnetization is consistent with zero within the statisti\u0002cal uncertainty, as expected for the paramagnetic phase.\r
For g < 1, non-zero magnetization is observed along\r
the x-direction, indicating spontaneous breaking of the\r
Xˆ → −Xˆ symmetry, characteristic of the ferromagnetic\r
phase. Due to experimental noise, the observed magne\u0002tization at small g is slightly lower than the theoretical\r
prediction ⟨Xˆ⟩ = (1−g\r
2\r
)\r
1/8\r
in the thermodynamic limit\r
L → ∞ [39–41].\r
We conducted separate experiments to characterize\r
noise and develop a corresponding error model, as de\u0002scribed in Appendix E. In simulations, we model gate\u0002induced dephasing and addressing noise due to ion mo\u0002tion by randomly perturbing gates in each shot. We\r
model idle dephasing, state preparation and measure\u0002ment (SPAM) errors, and X-flip errors during entangling\r
gates by introducing random Z- and X-flips. The noisy\r
simulations (shaded area in Fig. 2(a)) demonstrate ex\u0002cellent agreement with experimental data.\r
To determine the critical exponent, Fig. 2(b) displays\r
the order parameter ⟨Xˆ⟩ on a logarithmic scale. Due to\r
the small MERA bond dimension χ = 2, ⟨Xˆ⟩ saturates

field g. (a) Mean magnetization ⟨Xˆ⟩ over spin sites 0 and 1. The dashed gray line represents the reference value for a\r

χ = 4, respectively. The inset displays the critical exponent obtained from fitting the data on intervals g ∈ [0.5, gcut]. Error\r
bars indicate 1σ fitting uncertainties, and the theoretical critical exponent for the Ising class is 1/8. (c) Local observables\r
corresponding to the two competing terms in the Hamiltonian (1). (d) The R´enyi-2 entanglement entropy of a single spin.\r
The dashed gray line corresponds to the Z2-symmetric ground state. The inset shows the nearest-neighbor concurrence C0,1\r
(pairwise entanglement) for two neighboring sites. For all panels, solid lines correspond to theoretical predictions in the\r
thermodynamic limit, dotted lines represent ideal infinite MERA simulations, and the shaded areas indicate the central 95%\r
quantile obtained from noisy simulations based on an error model that reflects experimental device characteristics. Unless\r
otherwise noted, error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals obtained from a bootstrap resampling of the experimental data,\r
based on 2,000 measurements per quantum circuit.\r
at a non-zero value as the system approaches the criti\u0002cal regime. Nevertheless, it is still possible to determine\r
the critical scaling from these experimental data. The\r
inset shows the critical exponent obtained by fitting the\r
data in ranges g ∈ [0.5, gcut]. The fitted values grad\u0002ually converge to the theoretical prediction of 1/8 but\r
deviate when gcut approaches g = 1. Such deviations\r
near the critical point can be mitigated by increasing the\r
bond dimension χ. As shown by the thick gray dotted\r
line, a Trotterized MERA circuit [25–28] with χ = 4 is\r
predicted to achieve sufficient accuracy to eliminate the\r
discrepancies at the cost of more qubits and gates.\r
Figure 2(c) shows additional local observables. As\r
the transverse field g increases, the dominant contribu\u0002tion to the groundstate energy shifts from the correlator\r
⟨Xˆ\r
iXˆi+1⟩ to the field term ⟨Zˆi⟩, showing a symmetry due\r
to the Kramers-Wannier duality [42] with respect to the\r
critical point g = 1. The measured values of these ob\u0002servables cross at a slightly smaller value of g, aligning\r
with our noise model. Here, the noise is dominated by\r
fluctuations in XX-gate rotations due to the ions’ axial\r
motion (see Appendix E 3).

B. Entanglement structure\r
In the following, we use MERA to investigate ground\u0002state entanglement across the quantum phase transition\r
in the TFIM (1). We find that MERA on the digital\r
quantum computer can resolve details of the entangle\u0002ment structure, including the hallmark transition from\r
area-law to log-area-law scaling of block entanglement\r
entropies when approaching the critical point.\r
1. Local entanglement measures\r
For a pure state |Ψ⟩, the entanglement between sub\u0002system B and its complement A can be quantified by the\r
R´enyi entanglement entropy\r
S\r
(α)\r
B =\r
1\r
1 − α\r
log2 Tr(ˆϱ\r
α\r
B), where ˆϱB = TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| (2)\r
is the reduced density matrix of subsystem B. Our ap\u0002proach provides efficient access to the entanglement spec\u0002tra and, hence, S\r
(α)\r
B for any α. Here, we focus on the\r
R´enyi-2 entropy (α = 2) as, for the TFIM (1), all R´enyi\r
entropies with α > 0 exhibit the same scaling.\r
The reduced density matrix for a single-site is fully\r
characterized by its Bloch vector. The time-reversal sym\u0002metry of the TFIM ensures that the local expectation\r
value ⟨Yˆ ⟩ vanishes for all eigenstates. Thus, the Bloch\r
vector is determined by ⟨Xˆ⟩ and ⟨Zˆ⟩. Figure 2(d) shows\r
the measured single-site R´enyi-2 entanglement entropy.\r
Our data faithfully reproduces the predicted sharp peak\r
at criticality and tends to zero for small g. In the ferro\u0002magnetic phase, the two symmetry-broken ground states\r
are almost product states. Meanwhile, their symmetric\r
superposition is entangled, and the corresponding single\u0002site entanglement is smooth at the critical point. The in\u0002set of Fig. 2(d) presents the nearest-neighbor concurrence\r
(pairwise entanglement) C0,1 [41, 44] obtained from the\r
measured nearest-neighbor correlators ⟨Xˆ\r
0Xˆ1⟩, ⟨Zˆ0Zˆ1⟩,\r
and ⟨Yˆ\r
0Yˆ1⟩ [45, 46]. The concurrence slightly deviates\r
from theoretical predictions but aligns well with noisy\r
simulations. Notably, the concurrence does not peak\r
at criticality but increases smoothly before reaching a\r
broad maximum in the paramagnetic phase. This sug\u0002gests that the peak of single-site entanglement at critical\u0002ity arises not only from short-distance entanglement but\r
also from the accumulation of entanglement over long\r
distances. In contrast, in the paramagnetic phase, the\r
nearest-neighbor entanglement is the dominant contri\u0002bution to the single-site entanglement.\r
2. Entanglement scaling: area-law versus log-area-law\r
For the ground states of typical quantum many-body\r
systems in D spatial dimensions, the subsystem entangle\u0002ment entropy S(ℓ) is proportional to the surface area of\r
the subsystem ∝ ℓ\r
D−1\r
, rather than its volume ∝ ℓ\r
D [32–\r
34]. The entanglement entropy is dominated by short\u0002range correlations around the subsystem boundary, re\u0002sulting in area-law scaling. This can change when the\r
system becomes critical and the correlation length di\u0002verges. For critical systems in 1D and fermionic systems\r
with a Fermi surface of codimension D−1, the subsystem\r
entanglement entropy is predicted to follow a log-area law\r
∝ ℓ\r
D−1\r
log ℓ [47–52].\r
Resolving these fundamentally different scaling laws\r
has remained an experimental challenge. In small sys\u0002tems, it is difficult to differentiate between log-area-law\r
and area-law scalings. As the linear subsystem size ℓ\r
grows, preparing ground states with sufficient precision\r
becomes increasingly difficult, and, in direct approaches,\r
the number of measurements needed for subsystem to\u0002mography grows exponentially in ℓ.\r
For MERA, however, each step of the renormalization\r
process changes length scales by a constant factor. This\r
maps a logarithmic scaling in the subsystem size ℓ to\r
a linear scaling in the number of renormalization steps\r
T = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Thus, distinguishing between area and\r
log-area laws in 1D translates to determining whether the\r
entanglement entropy saturates or grows linearly with\r
increasing T.\r
We experimentally realize spatially infinite MERA\r
with a finite number of layers T. For a bipartition into\r
subsystems A = (−∞, 1] and B = [2, +∞), we im\u0002plement the holographic subsystem tomography as de\u0002scribed in Sec. II and detailed in Appendix A. We pre\u0002pare the MERA circuit within the causal cone of the\r
subsystem boundary, measure the T renormalized sites\r
at the right edge of the cone (Fig. 1), and use the classical\r
shadow method [53] to extract the R´enyi-2 entanglement\r
entropy (2). The finite number of MERA layers limits\r
the maximal correlation length to 3 × 2\r
T\r
. Thus, we ex\u0002perimentally probe effective subsystem sizes ℓ ∝ 2\r
T\r
. See\r
Appendix B for a more detailed argument on this relation\r
of T and effective subsystem sizes.\r
For the non-critical point g = 1.5 of the TFIM (1), the\r
measured half-chain R´enyi-2 entanglement entropy S is\r
shown in Fig. 3(b). We observe a rapid saturation of the\r
entanglement entropy for T ≥ 3, in agreement with the\r
area-law. This is expected as, due to the energy gap,\r
the physical correlation length ξ is finite. Here, addi\u0002tional MERA layers (T > 3) have a negligible effect on\r
the groundstate approximation and entanglement for this\r
gapped system. Our error model indicates that, in this\r
regime, SPAM errors and gate rotation errors due to the\r
ions’ axial motion are the dominant noise sources.\r
At criticality (g = 1), the system has gapless excita\u0002tions, and the correlation length diverges (ξ → ∞). Here,\r
we model the ground state using a scale-invariant MERA\r
with an infinite number of homogeneous identical layers\r
in both the spatial and preparation directions [35, 36].\r
Directly preparing a scale-invariant MERA is not exper\u0002imentally feasible. Instead, we truncate at layer T and\r
add an additional tensor to the top layer to minimize the

on the same dataset as Fig. 3, but here, positive semi-definite density matrices are reconstructed using maximum-likelihood\r
estimation.

7\r
finite-T effects as detailed in Appendix C.\r
The measured half-chain R´enyi-2 entanglement en\u0002tropy S at criticality is shown as a function of T in\r
Fig. 3(a). The observed entropy increases linearly by\r
approximately 1/16 per MERA layer. This is consistent\r
with the prediction 1\r
16 log2\r
(ℓ/a) of conformal field the\u0002ory, where a is an ultraviolet cutoff that regularizes the\r
continuum field theory [54]. The slight increase in the\r
measured S over the field-theoretical prediction is repro\u0002duced by our error model. Here, errors primarily arise\r
during SPAM and from fluctuations in gate angles due\r
to the ions’ axial motion; X-flips and idle dephasing are\r
secondary (see Appendix E).\r
3. Entanglement spectrum\r
Using the holographic tomography data and a\r
maximum-likelihood approach [55–58], we reconstruct\r
proper (positive semidefinite) density matrices ˆϱB for\r
subsystem B in the UˆB basis. They can be written in\r
the form ˆϱB = 2−\r
P\r
i\r
ζi|ζi⟩⟨ζi|\r
, where {ζi:= − log2 λi} is\r
the entanglement spectrum [59] expressed in terms of the\r
eigenvalues {λi} of ˆϱB.\r
Figures 4(a) and (d) show the two lowest entanglement\r
eigenvalues {ζ0, ζ1} of ˆϱB for the TFIM (1), revealing dis\u0002tinct behaviors at and away from the critical point. At\r
criticality (g = 1), the lowest eigenvalue ζ0 exhibits a\r
log-law scaling like the entanglement entropy, while ζ1\r
decreases with increasing T. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the\r
Schmidt gap ∆λ = λ0−λ1 reduces by approximately 1/24\r
per renormalization step, which agrees with the approx\u0002imate theoretical prediction ∆λ ∼ ℓ\r
−1/24 from Ref. [43],\r
where ℓ denotes again the (effective) subsystem size. For\r
the non-critical point g = 1.5, Fig. 4(d) shows that ζ0\r
and ζ1 saturate with increasing T.\r
Since g = 1.5 lies in the Z2-symmetric paramagnetic\r
phase, all subsystem density matrices of the ground state\r
must commute with the operator ⊗iZˆ\r
i\r
. We verify this\r
symmetry by measuring the spin-flip operator on subsys\u0002tem B. As discussed in Sec. II, the measurement is done\r
efficiently with the compressed representation of ˆϱB on\r
the renormalized sites, exploiting the fact that, for g ≥ 1,\r
the unitary UˆB which transforms the measured state to\r
the actual state on B preserves the Z2-symmetry. As ob\u0002served in Fig. 4(e), the associated entanglement Hamil\u0002tonian exhibits a ground state in the even-parity sector\r
and a first excited state in the odd sector. This mirrors\r
the properties of the system Hamiltonian, aligning with\r
recent efforts concerning connections between entangle\u0002ment Hamiltonians and system Hamiltonians [17, 60].\r
4. Subsystem fidelity\r
Finally, we compare the reconstructed subsystem den\u0002sity matrix ˆϱB in the UˆB basis with the ideal MERA\r
simulations, and show the infidelity 1 − F in Figs. 4c\r
and for the transverse fields g = 1.0 and 1.5, where the\r
fidelity is defined as\r
F =\r
\u0012\r
Tr qp\r
ϱˆB ρˆideal pϱˆB\r
\u00132\r
. (3)\r
We achieve infidelities ranging from 10−4to 10−2, which\r
enables the clear discrimination of different entanglement\r
scaling laws, even when the absolute difference in S is\r
small. These high fidelities arise from careful calibra\u0002tions, optimized ion–qubit mappings, the intrinsic noise\r
resilience of MERA, suitable gate decompositions for the\r
MERA circuit, and the efficient holographic tomography\r
method.\r
Recall that we determine ˆϱB through tomography on\r
only ∼ T renormalized sites at the edge of subsystem A’s\r
causal cone (cf. Sec. II B and Fig. 5), where, in the basis\r
defined by UˆB, all other qubits are in the |0⟩ state and\r
need not be implemented. This is sufficient because the\r
fidelity metric (3) and bipartite entanglement properties\r
are invariant under the unitary transformation UˆB.\r
Also, while many widely used variational ans¨atze\r
employ CNOT gates, our circuits use two-qubit XX\r
Mølmer-Sørensen gates with typical absolute rotation an\u0002gles in the range from 0.01π to 0.2π, which are much\r
smaller than those of fully entangling gates. As Mølmer\u0002Sørensen gate errors decrease with the rotation angle,\r
this leads to significantly reduced experimental errors.\r
Appendix F provides a breakdown of error contributions\r
and explains how the infidelity scales with experimental\r
errors.\r
IV. OUTLOOK\r
We employed MERA on an ion-trap quantum com\u0002puter to clearly resolve the quantum phase transition in a\r
condensed matter system, successfully capturing the uni\u0002versal properties of Ising-class physics. Furthermore, our\r
holographic subsystem tomography method made it pos\u0002sible to demonstrate the transition from area-law to log\u0002area-law scaling in groundstate entanglement entropies.\r
This entanglement scaling transition is a hallmark of\r
quantum many-body physics with no classical analog. Its\r
experimental observation had previously faced substan\u0002tial challenges including finite-size effects and attainable\r
fidelities.\r
The investigation of more complicated models, includ\u0002ing systems with higher spin and spatial dimensions, re\u0002quires larger MERA bond dimensions χ ≳ 8. In classical\r
MERA simulations, the primary bottleneck are tensor\r
contractions, whose cost scales as O(χ\r
r\r
), where the ex\u0002ponent r depends on the spatial dimension D and specific\r
MERA structure. In 1D with r = 7, . . . , 9, these costs\r
are still tractable for moderate bond dimensions χ ≲ 20\r
[22–24]. However, for higher-dimensional systems such\r
as (quasi-)2D frustrated quantum magnets and fermionic\r
systems, where quantum Monte Carlo generally fails due

8\r
to the negative sign problem, the classical contraction\r
costs with scaling exponents r = 16, . . . , 26 become pro\u0002hibitive even for small χ [24, 61].\r
To avoid these high contraction costs, our prior\r
work [25, 26] proposed implementing (Trotterized)\r
MERA on quantum computers. As discussed in Refs. [25,\r
26, 28], the required qubit count grows only logarithmi\u0002cally with χ and is independent of system size if mid\u0002circuit resets are available. The circuit depth scales as\r
O(T t), where the number of MERA layers T ∼ log ξ gov\u0002erns the maximal correlated length ξ, and t is a tunable\r
Trotter depth that controls the expressiveness of sub\u0002circuits in individual tensors. For example, simulating\r
a large (e.g., hundreds-by-hundreds) 2D system with a\r
2 × 2 7→ 1 MERA using χ = 8, T = 6, and t = 2 re\u0002quires either (i) 108 resettable qubits and a circuit depth\r
of 96 when minimizing depth or (ii) 42 qubits and depth\r
624 when minimizing the qubit count. Such circuits are\r
not classically tractable, yet they are realistic for state\u0002of-the-art quantum hardware.\r
Recent advances in trapped-ion platforms have\r
brought these capabilities closer to realization. For exam\u0002ple, 56-qubit systems with ≥99.8% two-qubit gate fidelity\r
are now available [62], and circuits with over 2000 two\u0002qubit gates have been demonstrated [63]. Larger systems,\r
with ∼ 200 qubits, can be achieved by scaling up the\r
system used in this work [64]. The primary error source\r
in high-connectivity long ion chains—motional heating\r
of low-frequency modes—can be reduced by over two or\u0002ders of magnitude using cryogenic techniques and sympa\u0002thetic cooling with a different isotopic species [65]. This\r
approach also facilitates qubit reset and reuse, further\r
enhancing scalability.\r
Since MERA has been rigorously proven to be free of\r
barren plateaus [30, 31], the variational optimization of\r
MERA on quantum computers is feasible, and we have\r
substantiated a polynomial quantum advantage, which\r
is particularly pronounced in D ≥ 2 spatial dimensions\r
[26].\r
Once an optimized MERA state is determined, rich\r
physics can be probed through local observables, cor\u0002relators, and entanglement measures. Measuring local\r
observables and correlators is straightforward, requir\u0002ing similar resources as energy estimation. Probing en\u0002tanglement is more demanding, as large-χ MERA in\u0002volve multiple qubits per renormalized site, making holo\u0002graphic subsystem tomography costly. To address this,\r
one can perform randomized measurements on edges of\r
the boundary causal cones, and adopt the idea of en\u0002tanglement Hamiltonian tomography [17, 60] to learn\r
the renormalized entanglement Hamiltonian, assuming a\r
structured form in terms of renormalized degrees of free\u0002dom.\r
Beyond the study of strongly correlated many-body\r
ground states, MERA states can serve as high-quality\r
starting points for the investigation of nonequilibrium dy\u0002namics. As demonstrated in this work, MERA accurately\r
captures both critical and non-critical ground states. A\r
natural extension is to prepare a MERA state and evolve\r
it under quench or Floquet dynamics. Since entangle\u0002ment growth under nonequilibrium dynamics generally\r
leads to volume-law scaling of entanglement entropies, a\r
quantum advantage is expected as soon as we surpass\r
the realm of exact classical Krylov-subspace methods for\r
≳36 qubits.\r

Appendix A: Holographic subsystem tomography\r
and entanglement scaling\r
For the study of bipartite entanglement entropies, en\u0002tanglement spectra, and subsystem state fidelities as dis\u0002cussed in Sec. III, we consider MERA approximations\r
|Ψ⟩ for the ground state and a spatial bipartition into\r
subsystem A and its complement B.\r
The goal of the holographic subsystem tomography is\r
to efficiently access the reduced density matrix ˆϱB =\r
TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| of subsystem B in the experiment. The iso\u0002metric property (Wˆ †Wˆ = 1) of the MERA tensors im\u0002plies that, under the partial trace TrA, all tensors out\u0002side the causal cone of B can be removed, as exemplified\r
by the shaded area atop subsystem A in Fig. 5. Fur\u0002thermore, the aforementioned quantities are all invariant\r
under unitary transformations on subsystem B. Using\r
this invariance, we can remove all MERA gates outside\r
the causal cone of subsystem A, which corresponds to\r
the action of the unitary transformation Uˆ †\r
B from Sec. II.\r
Only the gates inside the causal cone(s) of the subsys\u0002tem boundary(ies) remain. All qubits outside this causal\r
cone are in the reference state |0⟩ and need not be im\u0002plemented in the experiment.

To determine the transformed subsystem density ma\u0002trix\r
Uˆ †\r
BϱˆBUˆB = TrA(Uˆ †\r
B|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|UˆB), (A1)\r
we only need to measure the ∼ T non-trivial renormal\u0002ized sites at the edge of A’s causal cone, as indicated by\r
the diamonds in Fig. 5. Again T denotes the number of\r
MERA layers.\r
To further reduce experimental resource requirements,\r
we consider either infinite chains with a bipartition into\r
two semi-infinite subsystems, or finite chains with peri\u0002odic boundary conditions where block B is large enough\r
such that the causal cones of its two boundaries are dis\u0002joint as exemplified in Fig. 5. In the latter scenario, the\r
transformed density operator (A1) is actually a tensor\r
product of a state ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B at the left edge, a state ˜ϱ\r
R\r
B at the\r
right edge, and central sites in the reference state |0⟩⟨0|,\r
Uˆ †\r
BϱˆBUˆB = ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ . . . ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ ϱ˜\r
R\r
B. (A2)\r
Due to the product structure, ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B and ˜ϱ\r
R\r
B can be mea\u0002sured independently.\r
Moreover, when studying quantities that only depend\r
on the spectrum of ˆϱB for a bipartition of the system\r
into two equally sized halves and for total system sizes\r
L = 6 × 2\r
T\r
, 8 × 2\r
T\r
, ..., it is sufficient to measure only one\r
of the two density operators. In this case, the MERA\r
circuits for ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B and ˜ϱ\r
R\r
B prepare the same pure state, and\r
only differ in the selection of sites to be measured: those\r
at the right edge of the causal cone for ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B and those at\r
the left edge for ˜ϱ\r
R\r
B, as indicated in Fig. 5. Thus, all\r
nonzero eigenvalues of ˆϱB are given by the elementwise\r
product\r
{λiλj} of ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B’s spectrum {λi} (A3)\r
with itself.\r
Appendix B: Subsystem size versus number of\r
MERA layers\r
In the main text, we associated the number T of layers\r
in infinite MERA with the logarithm of subsystem sizes\r
ℓ. Here, we elaborate further on this relation.\r
Infinite binary 1D MERA |Ψ⟩ with T layers have a\r
maximum correlation range ξmax := 3 × 2\r
T\r
, where the\r
prefactor 3 arises from the maximal causal-cone width\r
of local operators acting on k ≤ 3 contiguous sites. In\r
particular, connected correlation functions\r
⟨Oˆ\r
iOˆ′\r
i+δℓ⟩Ψ − ⟨Oˆ\r
i⟩Ψ⟨Oˆ′\r
i+δℓ⟩Ψ (B1)\r
are exactly zero for all i and local operators Oˆ\r
i and Oˆ′\r
j\r
whenever δℓ ≥ ξmax − 3 + k.\r
Hence, all local observables, two-point correlation\r
functions, and subsystem density matrices for blocks of\r
ℓ ≤ ξmax sites of an infinite MERA coincide with those\r
of a corresponding finite-size MERA for a system of\r
2ξmax = 6 × 2\r
T\r
sites with periodic boundary conditions.\r
Furthermore, the half-chain density operator of an in\u0002finite T-layer MERA, considered in Sec. III, is given by\r
Uˆ †\r
BϱˆBUˆB = ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ . . . , (B2)\r
where ˜ϱ\r
L\r
B is the same state as the one in Eq. (A2) for an\r
ℓ = 3 × 2\r
T\r
-site block in a periodic 6 × 2\r
T\r
-site system,\r
establishing the exponential relation between ℓ and T.\r
The spectra of the states (B2) and (A2) are related by\r
the elementwise product (A3).\r
Appendix C: Scale-invariant MERA\r
Scale-invariant MERA are designed for critical sys\u0002tems, where correlation lengths diverge. As shown in\r
Fig. 6(a), they feature an elementary cell of tensors that\r
repeats in the spatial and renormalization directions, in\r
accordance with the self-similarity of critical systems.\r
Viewed in the renormalization direction, the scale\u0002invariant MERA maps the local Hamiltonian of a crit\u0002ical system into an RG fixed point. Seen in reverse, the\r
scale-invariant MERA acts as a quantum channel that\r
iteratively refines the state, starting from an initial ref\u0002erence state and adding layers to construct the ground\r
state of the critical system.\r
Consider spin sites 0 and 1. Their causal-cone state\r
as indicated by the unshaded region in Fig.6(a) is con\u0002structed by applying the same layer-transition channel\r
M (Fig. 6(b)) multiple times, where renormalized sites\r
that leave the causal cone are traced out. M is a quan\u0002tum channel and can be diagonalized in bi-orthonormal\r
operator bases such that\r
M(·) = |ϱˆsteady⟩⟩⟨⟨1| +\r
X\r
i>0\r
mi|rˆi⟩⟩⟨⟨ˆℓi|, (C1)\r
where |mi| < 1 for all i > 0, and we use a super-bra\u0002ket notation for the operator-basis elements according to\r
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product ⟨⟨Lˆ|Rˆ⟩⟩ := Tr\u0010\r
Lˆ†Rˆ\r
\u0011\r
.\r
With ˆr0 ≡ ϱˆsteady and ˆℓ0 ≡ 1, ˆri and ˆℓi are the right\r
and left eigen-operators of M for eigenvalue mi and obey\r
⟨⟨ˆℓi|rˆj ⟩⟩ = δi,j .\r
We initialize the MERA in the product state |0⟩ =\r
|0, . . . , 0⟩ at the topmost (infinite) layer. The expectation\r
value of a local observable Oˆ\r
0,1 with the scale-invariant\r
MERA then is\r

See Fig. 6(d). Experimentally, we cannot directly imple\u0002ment MERA with an infinite number of layers. Instead,\r
we truncate after layer T and use the top layer to prepare\r
a two-site state ˆϱ\r
′\r
that maximizes the contribution of the\r
dominant eigenmode ˆϱsteady of the layer-transition chan\u0002nel (C1). This is achieved by choosing the gate angles

FIG. 5. Holographic subsystem tomography and entanglement scaling. An infinite binary MERA with T layers is\r
consistent with a MERA on 6 × 2\r
T\r
sites with periodic boundary conditions. Here, T = 3, resulting in a total of 6 × 2\r
3 = 48\r
sites. All connected two-point correlation functions for sites of distance ≥ 3 × 2\r
T − 2 = 22 are exactly zero. For example,\r
⟨Xˆ10Yˆ31⟩ − ⟨Xˆ10⟩⟨Yˆ31⟩ can be nonzero while ⟨Xˆ10Yˆ32⟩ − ⟨Xˆ10⟩⟨Yˆ32⟩ ≡ 0. This is due to the fact that, in the latter case,\r
the causal cones of the two operators have no overlap. Similarly, for any bipartition of the system into equally sized blocks\r
like A = {26, . . . , 47, 0, 1} and B = {2, . . . , 25}, the causal cones of the two subsystem boundaries do not overlap. Hence,\r
measurements of the renormalized sites at the two boudnaries are independent of each other, i.e., follow a product distribution.\r

0 and 1. (f) The tensor network for the purity of the reduced density operator of subsystem [2, ∞). (g) In this case, the top\r

tomography on T qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone circuit (see also Fig. 5).

append T − 1 layers of the scale-invariant MERA to re\u0002fine the dominant eigenmode as shown in Fig. 6(e). This\r
approach is highly effective as demonstrated for T = 5\r
and a few local observables in Secs. III A and III B 1.\r
To account for layer truncations in the study of sub\u0002system purity and entanglement, we introduce a dou\u0002bled SWAP-contracted layer-transition map D as shown\r
in Fig. 6(c). For a scale-invariant MERA truncated af\u0002ter layer T and initialized with the reference state |0⟩,\r
the purity of subsystem B = [2, ∞) can be computed by\r
iteratively applying D to the (doubled) zero-product ref\u0002erence state |0, 0⟩⟨0, 0| at the topmost layer and taking\r

where the large-T limit is taken in the last line, and |0, 0⟩⟩\r
represents the projector |0, 0⟩⟨0, 0|. Hence, the entangle\u0002ment entropy should increase linearly with T, i.e., by a\r
constant in each renormalization step.\r
Even with the small bond dimension χ = 2, the domi\u0002nant eigenvalue d0 of D in the optimized scale invariant\r
MERA agrees well with the conformal field theory pre\u0002diction for the Ising model with central charge c = 1/2:\r
−8 log2 d0 = 0.475 . . . ≈ c. (C5)\r
Again, we truncate the scale-invariant MERA after\r
layer T ≤ 4 for experiments. To mitigate the effect of\r
the truncation, we do not initialize with the reference\r
state |0⟩ at the top layer but with a more suitable two\u0002site state |φ⟩, generated from |0⟩ through one entangling\r
and further single-qubit gates. These gates are chosen to\r
suppress subleading contributions in (C4) by minimiz\u0002ing P\r

After implementing such T-layer approximations of a\r
scale-invariant MERA in the experiment, we perform\r
the holographic subsystem tomography, measuring all T\r
qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone as\r
discussed in Sec. A and illustrated in Fig. 6(g).\r
Appendix D: Gate compilation and circuit examples\r
In the main text and previous appendices, we showed\r
tensor network diagrams of MERA and schematic gate\r
decompositions of individual tensors. Here, we demon\u0002strate how to compile these into native quantum gates\r
and provide concrete circuit examples for measuring both\r
local observables and nonlocal entanglement properties.\r
As shown in Fig. 7(a), a generic 4-by-4 unitary oper\u0002ation can be decomposed into a two-qubit circuit using\r
3 entangling gates and 12 single-qubit gates, involving a\r
total of 15 parameters (up to a global phase). However,\r
this generic decomposition turns out to be unnecessary\r
for our MERA circuits. For example, in a network of\r
such two-qubit unitaries, redundant single-qubit gates on\r
connected bonds can be eliminated. More importantly, a\r
physically motivated ansatz should preserve the symme\u0002tries of the Hamiltonian, except in cases of spontaneous\r
symmetry breaking.\r
For the transverse-field Ising model studied here, the\r
ground state exhibits time-reversal symmetry (invariance\r
under complex conjugation in the computational basis)\r
for all values of g and a Z2 symmetry when g ≤ 1. While\r
a global symmetry does not necessarily imply local sym\u0002metry, we find that, in our case, it does hold locally. A\r
suitable choice of entangling gates that respect the sym\u0002metries of the Ising model includes XY (θ) = e−iθXˆ⊗Y / ˆ 2\r
and YX(θ) = e−iθYˆ ⊗X/ˆ 2, which are real in the compu\u0002tational basis and respect the model’s Z2 symmetry as\r
[⊗iZˆ\r
i\r
, XY (θ)] = 0. Based on this, we replace XX and\r
Y Y gates with XY and YX gates. We remove ZZ and\r
single-qubit Z gates as they violate time-reversal sym\u0002metry. Variable Ry(θ) = e−iθY / ˆ 2 gates are retained in\r
some tensors to allow for spontaneous breaking of the Z2\r
symmetry. The Ry gates that have been removed only\r
have a relatively small effect on the accuracy.\r
The resulting refined gate compilation for a unit cell\r
in the binary MERA, including one isometry and one\r
unitary (dis)entangler, is shown in Fig. 7(b). This\r
symmetry-respecting compilation significantly reduces\r
the parameter space and redundancy without sacrific\u0002ing expressiveness in approximating the ground state, as\r
confirmed by our numerical simulations. Since binary\r
MERA with one qubit per bond is classically simula\u0002ble, we do not implement the variational MERA on the\r
quantum computer. Instead, we classically optimize the\r
MERA with the gate configuration in Fig. 7(b). Notably,\r
while the Ry gate is retained for all values of g, the op\u0002timized angles are non-zero only when g < 1 within our\r
data points, which is consistent with the presence of a\r
non-zero order parameter in the ferromagnetic phase.\r
In our experimental setup, the native entangling gate is\r
the XX gate. As shown in Fig. 7(c), we convert the XY\r
and YX gates into native gates by appending additional\r
virtual Rz(±\r
π\r
2\r
) rotations, which are effectively free, as\r
mentioned in Sec. II C.\r

FIG. 7. Gate compilation and circuit examples. (a) Gate decomposition of a generic two-qubit unitary. (b) Gate\r
compilation for a unit cell in the binary 1D MERA, incorporating symmetry constraints. The isometry tensor is formed by\r
injecting a |0⟩ qubit (indicated by a circle) into one leg of a unitary tensor. The unit cell contains six variable gates. (c)\r
Equivalence between the XY gate and a circuit of three native gates. (d) An example circuit used in the experiment, composed\r
of native gates. Qubits (circles with indices) are initialized in the |0⟩ state. The circuit consists of three layers, and in each\r
layer, gates of the same color correspond to either two isometric tensors or a single unitary (dis)entangler, respectively. Local\r
observables at spin sites 0 and 1 are obtained by measuring qubits 3 and 4, while subsystem entanglement is extracted by\r
measuring qubits 5, 6, and 7.\r
servables and subsystem entanglement can be probed by\r
preparing only the causal cone state (unshaded regions\r
in Figs. 1 and 5), rather than the full MERA circuit.\r
Fig. 7(d) presents a concrete example of such a circuit.\r
From left to right, 8 qubits are initialized in the |0⟩ state,\r
followed by layers of gates grouped into either isometry\r
or (dis)entangler tensors. Finally, the desired observables\r
are measured. In this circuit example, measurements on\r
qubits 3 and 4 yield local observables on spin sites 0 and\r
1 as indicated in Fig. 1, while qubits 5, 6, and 7 are used\r
to evaluate the entanglement between the subsystems A\r
and B consisting of spin sites (−∞, 1] and [2, ∞), respec\u0002tively.\r
Appendix E: System characterization and error\r
model\r
1. State preparation and measurement error\r
State preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors\r
contribute significantly to our error budget. To quan\u0002tify the probability pd of SPAM errors for the dark state\r
(|0⟩), we performed fluorescence detection after initial\u0002izing all qubits via the usual optical pumping, yielding\r
an average measured error of 0.16% (see Fig. 8 for de\u0002tailed SPAM errors). To measure the probability pb of\r
SPAM errors for the bright state (|1⟩), we applied Ry(π)\r
gates following the optical pumping and then performed\r
fluorescence detection, yielding an average measured er\u0002ror of 0.45% (see Fig. 8 for detailed SPAM errors). We\r
checked the rotation error of the Ry(π) gates by applying\r
nine consecutive Ry(π)-gates, yielding a population error\r
of 0.56+0.17\r
−0.12% as determined by the binomial proportion\u0002ate 95% confidence interval using the Clopper-Pearson\r
method. The population error resulting from single-qubit\r
gates should scale superlinearly with the number N of\r
gates, corresponding to a mixture of uncorrelated and\r
correlated noise. Our results imply a population error\r
below 10−3 per π-gate, which is below the determined\r
bright-state SPAM error.\r
The measurement error for the 171Yb+ hyperfine\r
qubits arises from optical pumping between the hyper\u0002fine states during the optical detection pulse [66, 67]. We\r
fit the measured photon count statistics at various detec\u0002tion time τ to an optical pumping model as discussed\r
below to determine the state preparation error and the\r
measurement errors.\r
The distributions of detection counts for a single ion\r
prepared in the bright state for different detection times\r
are shown in Fig. 9(a). Ideally, the ion would cycle be\u0002tween the |S, F = 1⟩ and |P, F = 0⟩ manifolds, resulting\r
in a Poisson distribution of the recorded photon counts.\r
However, the bright state can be off-resonantly pumped\r
to the dark hyperfine ground state via the |S, F = 1⟩ →\r
|P, F = 1⟩ transition detuned by 2.1 GHz with a rate Rb\r
that is about 5 × 104times lower than the bright-state\r
photon scattering rate Γsc. Neglecting the even slower\r
dark-to-bright pumping process, the predicted distribu\u0002tion of the bright-state photon counts are\r

(b). The red dashed lines indicate a fit to the models from Eq. (E1) and (E2).\r
with mean ¯n, and η is the detection efficiency. The red\r

inversely proportional to the fitted variances to obtain\r
Rb = 3.0(1) × 102/s. The detection count statistics for\r
a single ion prepared in the dark |S, F = 0⟩ state are\r
shown in Fig. 9(b). The dark state can be off-resonantly\r
pumped to the bright manifold via the 14.7-GHz detuned\r
|S, F = 0⟩ → |P, F = 1⟩ transition, with a rate Rd that\r
is about 106times lower than Γsc. Neglecting the reverse\r

To distinguish the preparation error from the measure\u0002ment error, we fitted the average dark-state photon num\u0002ber as a function of detection time τ (Fig. 10) to the rate\r

confirms that\r
our SPAM error is dominated by the measurement errors,\r
as p ≪ pd, pb.\r
To model state-preparation error in the numerical sim\u0002ulations, we flip each qubit with probability p. To sim\u0002ulate the detection error, after applying the circuit and\r
measuring in the computational basis {|0⟩, |1⟩}, we ran\u0002domly flip |0⟩ → |1⟩ with probability pd −p and |1⟩ → |0⟩\r
with probability pb − p.

2. Idling noise\r
We characterized the dephasing of idle qubits using\r
a Ramsey pulse sequence. After applying Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) gates\r
to all 13 qubits, we simulated idling by turning off the\r
individual-addressing Raman beams while keeping the\r
global beam on with the same settings as during a gate\r
sequence. After a variable idle time τidle, we completed\r
the Ramsey sequence with Rz(ϕ) and Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) gates and\r
recorded the |1⟩ state population as a function of ϕ. We\r
obtained the fitted ion-averaged contrast C from the re\u0002sulting fringes and modeled it as A e\r
−τidle/T ∗\r
2 . Fig. 11\r
shows a representative fit from a sample dataset, yielding\r
A = 0.991(1) and T\r
∗\r
2 = 300(17) ms. The deviation of the\r
fitted value of A from 1 mainly reflects SPAM errors, with\r
additional contributions potentially arising from residual\r
single-qubit gate errors and qubit addressing and detec\u0002tion crosstalk. From several datasets collected on differ\u0002ent experimental days, the fitted T\r
∗\r
2\r
ranges from 260 ms\r
to 370 ms, with an average of 290 ms. We attribute the\r
measured dephasing to acoustic noise, mainly from air\r
cooling fans, in our phase-sensitive Raman interferom\u0002eter setup. We expect that T\r
∗\r
2\r
times of several seconds\r
can be achieved using phase-insensitive schemes [69] that\r
are compatible with our experimental setup.\r
In our simulations, we model the effects of dephasing\r
on the qubit density matrix ˆρ over the time interval t via\r
the quantum channel\r
EZ(ˆρ) = (1 − pZ)ˆρ + pZZˆρˆZ, ˆ (E4)\r
with the Z-flip probability pZ = t/(2T\r
∗\r
2\r
).\r
3. Gate errors\r
a. Axial motion\r
Axial motion of our 15-ion chain, dominated by the\r
lowest-frequency axial mode (mode 0) with angular fre\u0002quency ω0 = 2π × 241.8 kHz, is a leading error source in\r
our platform. This motion misaligns the ions relative to\r
the tightly-focused addressing beams, causing gate errors\r
[65]. These errors increase over time as the ions’ motion\r
is driven by noisy electric fields.\r
We quantified the addressing error after a wait time t\r
following laser cooling by applying a variable number N\r
of XX(\r
π\r
2\r
) gates of total duration ∆t to ions i and j and\r
measuring the mean population P|11⟩ of the |1, 1⟩ state.\r
The recorded populations P|11⟩ as a function of N for\r
(i, j) = (3, −3) are shown in the inset of Fig. 12. Uncer\u0002tainty in the ions’ axial motion translates into a variance\r
in the total XX rotation angle, leading to damping of\r
P|11⟩ oscillations.\r
The observed damping is governed by the statistics of\r
the phonon number of mode 0 during gate application\r
[65]. We model the evolution of the phonon number nt\r
at time t as a biased random walk. Since the energy of\r
mode 0 following laser cooling corresponds to hundreds\r
of phonons, and the average heating per XX gate corre\u0002sponds to more than 20 phonons, we coarse-grain nt on\r
intervals of size δn with 1 ≤ δn ≪ 2nt and model the\r
random walk as\r

fitted initial phonon number in this mode is ¯n0 = 409(4)\r
and the heating rate is n¯˙ = 133(1) phonons/ms.\r
To model gate rotation errors for arbitrary single\u0002and two-qubit gates, in each shot of the noisy simu\u0002lations, we sample the initial phonon number n0 from\r
an exponential distribution with mean ¯n0. We then\r
evolve nt using the random walk model (E5). For\r
each native gate in the circuit, we compute the time\u0002averaged phonon number n\r

phonon number n\r

b. X-errors\r
We describe X-errors during an XX(θ) gate on ion pair\r
(i, j) using a bit-flip channel acting on the density matrix\r
ρˆ of ion i as\r
EX(ˆρ) = (1 − pX)ˆρ + pXXˆρˆX, ˆ (E8)\r
where pX ≡ pX,i,j (θ) is the X-flip probability per gate.\r
X-errors can be caused by residual spin-motion en\u0002tanglement at the end of Mølmer-Sørensen gates. They\r
can be minimized by carefully choosing the motional de\u0002tuning, gate duration, and envelope of the amplitude\u0002modulated gate waveforms [70]. In-between experiment\r
runs, we stabilized frequencies of the radial ion-motion\r
modes via blue-sideband Ramsey spectroscopy. Each of\r
the central 11 qubits was used to query one of 11 radial\r
modes that are addressed by the entangling gate wave\u0002forms. The obtained spectroscopical data was used to\r
automatically adjust the quadratic and quartic terms in\r
the static axial potential of the trap and a common mo\u0002tional offset frequency for all gates.\r
After applying N consecutive XX(\r

c. Z-errors\r
To measure Stark shifts during a specific XX gate, we\r
insert N pairs of XX(\r
π\r
2\r
) − XX(−\r
π\r
2\r
) gates into a Ram\u0002sey pulse sequence consisting of initial Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) and final\r
Rz(ϕ)−Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) pulses applied to each targeted ion. After\r
adjusting the qubit frequencies during the gate to com\u0002pensate for the measured shifts, we use the same sequence\r
to estimate any residual gate Z-errors.\r
The fitted contrast of the obtained Ramsey fringes for a\r
sample gate is shown in Fig. 14(a). The observed depen\u0002dence of the contrast on N is roughly quadratic, indicat\u0002ing that the phase shift error accumulates coherently as\r
the number of gates increases. We model the observed de\u0002coherence by correlated fluctuations in the gate-induced\r
Stark shift, which can arise from fluctuations in the am\u0002plitude balance of the red and blue tones of the Mølmer\u0002Sørensen gate due to air turbulence in the Raman beam\r
setup. Since our Ramsey sequence prepares the qubits\r
in the X-basis, we do not expect gate X-errors to affect\r
the measured contrast. We assume that the phase shift\r
ϕiinduced on ion i by a fully-entangling XX gate during\r
each shot follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean\r
and standard deviation σ\r
i\r

. This noise model results in a\r
fringe contrast proportional to e−(Nσi\r

Figure 14 show fits of this model to the measured contrast\r
data and the fitted values of σ\r

In the noise-model simulations, for each shot, we sam\u0002ple random numbers s from the Gaussian distribution\r

the ideal XX(θ) gate by\r

Appendix F: Breakdown of error contributions\r
To better understand our experimental results, we an\u0002alyze the breakdown of error contributions through nu\u0002merical simulation. As shown in Fig. 15, we selected two\r
representative cases from Fig. 4 of the main text, one\r
with the highest reported infidelity 1 − F (∼ 10−2) and\r
one with the lowest (∼ 10−4).\r
The case of highest reported infidelity corresponds to a\r
4-qubit tomography result on a 4-layer MERA circuit at\r
the critical point g = 1. The circuit involves 9 qubits and\r
21 XX gates with rotation amplitudes ranging from 0.06π\r
to 0.18π. We performed 1,500 measurement shots per ba\u0002sis over a total of 34 = 81 measurement bases. Based on\r
our error model and the calibrated parameters provided\r
in the Appendix E, we identify several key sources of er\u0002ror. First, there is the inevitable statistical uncertainty\r
in the measured density matrix elements on the order of\r
∼ 10−2from the finite number of measurement shots.\r
Second, aggregated SPAM errors for the 4-qubit tomog\u0002raphy are on the order of ∼ 10−2\r
. The dominant gate\r
error arises from rotation-angle fluctuations caused by\r
axial motion of the ion chain, which, for fully-entangling

FIG. 15. Breakdown of error contributions. The top row (a,c) shows the first eigenvalues ζ0 of the entanglement\r
Hamiltonian, and the bottom row (b,d) shows corresponding state infidelities 1 − F. The left column (a,b) presents results\r
at the critical point g = 1 with T = 4, while the right column (c,d) corresponds to the gapped phase at g = 1.5 with T = 1.\r
Experimental data points with error bars are reproduced from Fig. 4 in the main text. The dashed lines indicate the ideal\r
simulation results from Fig. 4. Noisy simulation results are shown as shaded regions representing the 95% quantiles, with solid\r
colored lines indicating the mean values. In the “full noise” case, we reproduce the full noisy simulation including all error\r
sources from Fig. 4. In the “shot only” case, all errors are disabled except for shot noise (the statistical uncertainty due to\r
the finite number of measurement shots). In the remaining cases, the simulations include both the shot noise and the specified\r
individual error source. We run 1000 independent noisy simulation trials for each case. Each trail uses the same number of\r
measurement shots as the experiment: 1,500 shots per basis per trial in the left column, and 8,000 shots per basis per trial in\r
the right column.\r
gates, typically leads to errors on the order of 10−2. After\r
accounting for the error rescaling due to smaller rotation\r
angles in the actual MERA gates and the accumulation\r
of errors throughout the circuit, the overall gate-induced\r
error is also expected to be in the 10−2range. This es\u0002timate is confirmed in Fig. 15(a). A small discrepancy\r
remains between the experimental data and the full-noise\r
simulation, which we attribute to system miscalibration\r
over the long experimental runtime required for 4-qubit\r
tomography, as well as unmodeled single-qubit gate er\u0002rors.\r
The case of lowest reported infidelity corresponds to a\r
single-qubit tomography result on a single-layer MERA\r
circuit in the gapped phase at g = 1.5. The circuit in\u0002volves only 2 qubits and a single XX gate with a rotation\r
amplitude of 0.095π. We performed 8,000 measurement\r
shots for each Pauli-X, -Y , and -Z basis. In this case,\r
the statistical uncertainty from finite sampling is on the\r
order of 10−3 ∼ 10−2, while the SPAM error for a single\r
qubit is on the order of 10−3, and the error from the sin\u0002gle gate is also on the order of 10−3\r
. Hence, we expect\r
the statistical uncertainty to dominate over other error\r
sources, which is consistent with the simulation results\r
shown in Fig. 15(c).\r
We observe that the infidelity is of comparable magni\u0002tude to the errors for the high-infidelity case in Fig. 15(b)\r
and at least an order of magnitude below the error scale\r
for the low-infidelity case in Fig. 15(d). We attribute this\r
to the fact that the infidelity has different scaling behav\u0002ior for rank-deficient and full-rank states: Consider the\r
exact (noise-free) density operator ˆρ and the perturbed\r
version ˆσ = ˆρ + ϵDˆ with noise level ϵ and Tr(Dˆ) = 0.\r
For a full-rank state ˆρ, the perturbed ˆσ remains well\u0002defined (positive semidefinite) for sufficiently small ϵ > 0\r
as well as small ϵ < 0. The infidelity 1 − F(ˆρ, σˆ(ϵ)) is\r
differentiable and minimal at ϵ = 0. This implies that\r
the linear term vanishes and 1 − F = O(ϵ\r
2\r
). This is\r
the case in Fig. 15(d), where the corresponding single\u0002qubit reduced density matrix has full rank with eigenval\u0002ues {0.98, 2.2 × 10−2}. A linear scaling 1 − F = O(ϵ)\r
is only possible for rank-deficient states. For example,\r
consider a pure state ˆρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and the perturbation\r
Dˆ = −|ψ⟩⟨ψ| + |ψ⊥⟩⟨ψ⊥| with an orthogonal state |ψ⊥⟩\r
and ϵ ≥ 0. In this case, the infidelity is simply ϵ. In the\r
current experiments, the ideal reduced density matrix is\r
indeed approximately rank-deficient at larger layer num\u0002bers T, and this is the case in Fig. 15(b) with eigenvalues\r
{0.92, 7.9 × 10−2, 3.5 × 10−3, 3.1 × 10−4, 2.7 × 10−4, 2.7 ×\r
10−5, . . . }.

The investigation of strongly-correlated quantum matter is difficult due to the curse of dimen\u0002sionality and intricate entanglement structures. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the\r
vicinity of continuous quantum phase transitions, where quantum fluctuations manifest across all\r
length scales. While quantum simulators give controlled access to a number of strongly correlated\r
systems, the study of critical phenomena has been hampered by finite-size effects arising from di\u0002verging correlation lengths. Moreover, the experimental investigation of entanglement in many-body\r
systems has been hindered by limitations in measurement protocols. To address these challenges, we\r
employ the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and implement a holographic\r
scheme for subsystem tomography on a fully-connected trapped-ion quantum computer. Our method\r
accurately represents infinite systems and long-range correlations with few qubits, facilitating the\r
efficient extraction of observables and entanglement properties, even at criticality. We observe a\r
quantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking and reveal the evolution of entan\u0002glement properties across the critical point. For the first time, we demonstrate log-law scaling of\r
subsystem entanglement entropies at criticality on a digital quantum computer. This achievement\r
highlights the potential of MERA for the investigation of strongly-correlated many-body systems\r
on quantum computers.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
In physics and materials science, universality ap\u0002pears near continuous phase transitions, where long\u0002range properties become independent of microscopic de\u0002tails, and the singular behavior of physical quantities\r
such as susceptibilities and correlation lengths can be\r
characterized by universal critical exponents. While clas\u0002sical phase transitions are driven by thermal fluctuations,\r
quantum phase transitions occur at zero temperature\r
when a system parameter is varied, causing the ground\r
state to become highly entangled due to quantum fluc\u0002tuations [1, 2]. This groundstate non-locality presents\r
challenges for theoretical and experimental analysis.\r
Rapid advancements on controlled quantum platforms\r
have expanded the range of experimentally accessible\r
quantum many-body systems on quantum simulators and\r
computers [3–10]. Previous studies [11–18] have made\r
significant progress in the experimental characterization\r
of entanglement. However, probing entanglement prop\u0002erties across quantum phase transitions remains difficult.\r
Analog quantum simulators have limited control, re\u0002stricting available models and measurements [19]. Quan\u0002tum simulations using quantum computers face chal\u0002lenges including: (i) Limited number of qubits: Quantum\r
phase transitions formally occur only in infinite systems,\r
∗ thomas.barthel@duke.edu\r
† marko.cetina@duke.edu\r
and finite-size effects are pronounced in the vicinity of\r
critical points. Preparing critical ground states directly\r
requires more qubits than current quantum devices offer.\r
(ii) Exponential cost for probing subsystem entanglement:\r
Resolving detailed entanglement structures requires state\r
tomography for large subsystems, which generally results\r
in exponential costs. (iii) Difficulties in state prepara\u0002tion: Without deeper insight into the physics, the study\r
of complex many-body ground states necessitates highly\r
expressive quantum circuits with many gates, leading to\r
low trainability [20, 21] and significant error accumula\u0002tion.\r
We overcome these challenges for condensed-matter\r
ground states using highly structured quantum cir\u0002cuits on a digital quantum computer. The cir\u0002cuits prepare states corresponding to hierarchical tensor\r
networks—the multiscale entanglement renormalization\r
ansatz (MERA) [22–24]. This ansatz can represent in\u0002finite systems and accurately encodes long-range corre\u0002lations, even at critical points. The causal structure of\r
MERA, inspired by the real-space renormalization group,\r
drastically reduces circuit depths and the number of mea\u0002sured qubits, both scaling logarithmically with system\r
size [25–28]. This allows efficient extraction of local\r
observables, subsystem entanglement, and entanglement\r
spectra. Additionally, MERA is robust to noise [29] and\r
not affected by barren plateaus [30, 31].\r
In this work, we study quantum many-body ground\r
states on a digital quantum computer based on a chain of\r
ytterbium ions. We demonstrate a quantum phase tran\u0002arXiv:2412.18602v3 [quant-ph] 24 Aug 2025

FIG. 1. MERA on a trapped-ion chain. (a) An infinite,\r
binary 1D MERA with three homogeneous layers. The ansatz\r
is prepared from top to bottom, with each layer comprising\r
entangling gates (bare rectangles) and isometries (rectangles\r
with attached circles) that double the number of sites. The\r
output is the many-body state on the physical spin sites.\r
Repeating the MERA circuit horizontally in the spatial di\u0002mension generates a state in the thermodynamic limit. Lo\u0002cal observables and bipartite entanglement can be studied\r
by executing circuits within the corresponding causal cone\r
(unshaded area) and measuring the target qubits. (b) Each\r
MERA tensor is implemented as a sequence of two- and one\u0002qubit gates. Circles represent qubits initialized in |0⟩, and\r
diamonds indicate measurements. (c) Repeated preparation\r
and measurement yield probabilistic binary outcomes (0s and\r
1s) from which the desired physical properties can be inferred.\r

sition characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking\r
in the thermodynamic limit, using 12 or fewer qubits. We\r
show the universal scaling of relevant physical quantities\r
near the transition and observe significant changes in the\r
entanglement structure across the critical point. At the\r
critical point, we find that the subsystem entanglement\r
entropies follow a universal log-area law, and the gap of\r
the entanglement Hamiltonian closes as the subsystem\r
size increases. In non-critical regimes, subsystem entan\u0002glement entropy follows an area law [32–34]. The mea\u0002sured entanglement Hamiltonian remains gapped with\r
increasing subsystem size and accurately reproduces ex\u0002pected symmetry properties.\r
II. SETUP\r
Preparing ground states of many-body systems with\r
long-range quantum fluctuations is challenging. This can\r
be mitigated by accounting for the system’s entanglement\r
structure. To approximate the ground state |Ψ⟩ in the\r
thermodynamic limit, we implement MERA on a digital\r
ion-trap quantum computer.\r
A. MERA circuits\r
As shown in Fig. 1(a), the layered structure of MERA\r
tensor networks introduces an additional dimension asso\u0002ciated with a hierarchy of length and energy scales. The\r
MERA comprises T layers, each composed of unitary\r
(dis)entanglers and isometries, which can be efficiently\r
implemented on our hardware. Viewed from bottom to\r
top, starting from the physical layer, MERA acts as a\r
renormalization group (RG) flow, where the ascending\r
layer index represents the RG scale. In each renormal\u0002ization step, short-distance entanglement is removed by\r
the disentanglers (bare rectangles), and the isometries\r
(rectangles with attached circles) then coarse-grain the\r
system. This process maps physical sites to renormal\u0002ized effective degrees of freedom, continuing until the\r
final layer T ∼ log ξ is reached, where ξ is the largest\r
correlation length in the system.\r
Viewed in reverse (the direction of decreasing layer in\u0002dex), the MERA represents a quantum circuit, which\r
prepares the quantum state by first generating long\u0002range correlations associated with low-energy modes, and\r
then progressively incorporating shorter-range correla\u0002tions that correspond to higher energy scales. For each\r
layer, ancillary qubits initialized in the |0⟩ state (depicted\r
as circles) are injected and entangled with existing qubits\r
through unitary operations. Each unitary tensor consists\r
of two-qubit entangling gates and single-qubit rotations,\r
as illustrated in Fig. 1(b).\r
B. Observables and holographic subsystem\r
tomography\r
Local observables can be studied by implementing only\r
the associated causal-cone circuits. For measurements on\r
sites 0 and 1 of a binary one-dimensional (1D) MERA,\r
the corresponding reduced circuit is indicated by the non\u0002shaded MERA tensors in Fig. 1(a). Due to their isomet\u0002ric properties, the shaded tensors outside the causal cone\r
do not influence the local measurements.\r
Entanglement entropies and spectra for a spatial bipar\u0002tition of the system into parts A and B can be obtained\r
from the reduced density matrix ˆϱB = TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|. For\r
a MERA, only the gates within the causal cone of the\r
boundary between A and B need to be implemented, as\r
gates outside the causal cone correspond to unitary basis\r
transformations UˆA and UˆB in the two subsystems and\r
do not affect bipartite entanglement properties. More\u0002over, tomography on the renormalized sites (qubits) at\r
the edges of A’s causal cone provides access to ˆϱB in the\r
basis defined by UˆB. Thus, due to the causal structure\r
of MERA, the number of gates and number of measured\r
qubits are proportional to the number of layers T ∼ log ξ,\r
rather than the total system size and subsystem size,

3\r
respectively. Details of our scheme, termed holographic\r
subsystem tomography, are described in Appendix A.\r
In the experiment, we implement an infinite, homoge\u0002neous, binary 1D MERA with bond dimension χ = 2\r
and up to T = 5 layers, which captures a maximum cor\u0002relation range of 3 × 2\r
5 = 96 sites. To this purpose,\r
all tensors of the same color in Fig. 1(a) are chosen to\r
be identical, and the shown tensor network structure is\r
continued horizontally ad infinitum. For the self-similar\r
critical systems, the correlation length ξ diverges, which\r
we address by employing a scale-invariant MERA [35, 36]\r
as discussed in Sec. III B 2 and Appendix C.\r
C. Trapped-ion system\r
We implement MERA circuits on a digital ion-trap\r
quantum computer. Our experimental system consists\r
of a linear chain of fifteen 171Yb+ ions, spaced by ap\u0002proximately 3.7 µm, confined in a micro-fabricated Paul\r
trap (Sandia HOA-2.1.1 [37]) held in a room-temperature\r
vacuum chamber. The qubits are encoded in the hyper\u0002fine “clock” states of the ground 2S1/2 electronic manifold\r
as |0⟩ ≡ |F = 0; mF = 0⟩ and |1⟩ ≡ |F = 1; mF = 0⟩,\r
where F is the total atomic angular momentum and mF\r
its projection onto the direction of the magnetic field,\r
with a magnitude of 3.2 G. Qubits are initialized in the\r
|0⟩ state using optical pumping and measured by state\u0002dependent fluorescence on the 369 nm D1 line.\r
The qubits are manipulated via a Raman process us\u0002ing a wide (300 µm×30 µm) linearly-polarized global\u0002addressing beam and equispaced, linearly-polarized\r
1 µm-diameter individual-addressing beams derived from\r
the same 355-nm pulsed laser (Coherent Paladin Com\u0002pact 355-4000). Radio-frequency (rf) gate waveforms\r
are produced by an rf system on a chip (ZCU111\r
from Xilinx Corp.) controlled by the Sandia Octet\r
firmware [38] and separately modulated onto each laser\r
beam using acousto-optic modulators (L3 Harris Corp.).\r
Available single-qubit operations are virtual z-axis ro\u0002tations Rz(θ), implemented via phase offsets in the\r
radio-frequency controls, and physical xy-plane rota\u0002tions R(θ, ϕ) = e−iθ(Xˆ cos ϕ+Yˆ sin ϕ)/2\r
. Entangling gates\r
XX(θ) = e−iθXˆi⊗Xˆj /2 between arbitrary qubits i and\r
j are realized through a Mølmer-Sørensen interaction\r
mediated by the shared radial motional modes of the\r
ion chain with mode frequencies near 3 MHz. This in\u0002teraction is implemented by amplitude-shaping a state\u0002dependent force on the addressed ions using the 355-nm\r
Raman process.\r
The all-to-all qubit connectivity of our platform simpli\u0002fies the implementation of the non-local MERA circuits.\r
Using a detailed error model discussed in Appendix E, we\r
optimize ion-to-qubit mappings for each MERA circuit;\r
see Fig. 1(d).\r
III. RESULTS\r
To demonstrate the potential of the MERA approach,\r
we apply it to the 1D transverse-field Ising model (TFIM)\r
described by the Hamiltonian\r
Hˆ = −\r

L\r
i\r
Xˆ\r
iXˆi+1 − g\r

i\r
Zˆ\r
i\r
. (1)\r
Here, Xˆ\r
i and Zˆi are Pauli operators acting on the spin\r
at lattice site i, and g is the transverse magnetic field.\r
The TFIM features a well-characterized continuous quan\u0002tum phase transition with spontaneous Z2 symmetry\u0002breaking, making it a good testbed for our approach.\r
Since the 1D binary MERA with small bond dimension\r
is classically simulable, we determine the optimal gate pa\u0002rameters of the variational MERA circuit using classical\r
computers. The gate compilation of the tensors and a\r
concrete circuit example are discussed in Appendix D.\r
A. Quantum phase transition\r
We benchmark the infinite MERA across the quantum\r
phase transition of the TFIM (1) by first measuring local\r
observables ⟨Oˆ\r
i⟩. We prepare the causal-cone state of\r
the target spins as indicated in Fig. 1. The number T\r
of employed MERA layers ranges from 2 to 5, depending\r
on the correlation length; T = 2 layers are used far from\r
criticality and up to 5 layers near the critical point g = 1.\r
Correspondingly, the number of required qubits ranges\r
from 6 to 12.\r
Figure 2(a) shows the measured magnetization ⟨Xˆ⟩ in\r
the x-direction as a function of the z-field g, nicely re\u0002solving the phase transition. For g > 1, the observed\r
magnetization is consistent with zero within the statisti\u0002cal uncertainty, as expected for the paramagnetic phase.\r
For g < 1, non-zero magnetization is observed along\r
the x-direction, indicating spontaneous breaking of the\r
Xˆ → −Xˆ symmetry, characteristic of the ferromagnetic\r
phase. Due to experimental noise, the observed magne\u0002tization at small g is slightly lower than the theoretical\r
prediction ⟨Xˆ⟩ = (1−g\r
2\r
)\r
1/8\r
in the thermodynamic limit\r
L → ∞ [39–41].\r
We conducted separate experiments to characterize\r
noise and develop a corresponding error model, as de\u0002scribed in Appendix E. In simulations, we model gate\u0002induced dephasing and addressing noise due to ion mo\u0002tion by randomly perturbing gates in each shot. We\r
model idle dephasing, state preparation and measure\u0002ment (SPAM) errors, and X-flip errors during entangling\r
gates by introducing random Z- and X-flips. The noisy\r
simulations (shaded area in Fig. 2(a)) demonstrate ex\u0002cellent agreement with experimental data.\r
To determine the critical exponent, Fig. 2(b) displays\r
the order parameter ⟨Xˆ⟩ on a logarithmic scale. Due to\r
the small MERA bond dimension χ = 2, ⟨Xˆ⟩ saturates

inset shows the critical exponent obtained by fitting the\r
data in ranges g ∈ [0.5, gcut]. The fitted values grad\u0002ually converge to the theoretical prediction of 1/8 but\r
deviate when gcut approaches g = 1. Such deviations\r
near the critical point can be mitigated by increasing the\r
bond dimension χ. As shown by the thick gray dotted\r
line, a Trotterized MERA circuit [25–28] with χ = 4 is\r
predicted to achieve sufficient accuracy to eliminate the\r
discrepancies at the cost of more qubits and gates.\r

the transverse field g increases, the dominant contribu\u0002tion to the groundstate energy shifts from the correlator\r
⟨Xˆ\r
iXˆi+1⟩ to the field term ⟨Zˆi⟩, showing a symmetry due\r
to the Kramers-Wannier duality [42] with respect to the\r
critical point g = 1. The measured values of these ob\u0002servables cross at a slightly smaller value of g, aligning\r
with our noise model. Here, the noise is dominated by\r
fluctuations in XX-gate rotations due to the ions’ axial\r

For the ground states of typical quantum many-body\r
systems in D spatial dimensions, the subsystem entangle\u0002ment entropy S(ℓ) is proportional to the surface area of\r
the subsystem ∝ ℓ\r
D−1\r
, rather than its volume ∝ ℓ\r
D [32–\r
34]. The entanglement entropy is dominated by short\u0002range correlations around the subsystem boundary, re\u0002sulting in area-law scaling. This can change when the\r
system becomes critical and the correlation length di\u0002verges. For critical systems in 1D and fermionic systems\r
with a Fermi surface of codimension D−1, the subsystem\r
entanglement entropy is predicted to follow a log-area law\r
∝ ℓ\r
D−1\r
log ℓ [47–52].\r
Resolving these fundamentally different scaling laws\r
has remained an experimental challenge. In small sys\u0002tems, it is difficult to differentiate between log-area-law\r
and area-law scalings. As the linear subsystem size ℓ\r
grows, preparing ground states with sufficient precision\r
becomes increasingly difficult, and, in direct approaches,\r
the number of measurements needed for subsystem to\u0002mography grows exponentially in ℓ.\r
For MERA, however, each step of the renormalization\r
process changes length scales by a constant factor. This\r
maps a logarithmic scaling in the subsystem size ℓ to\r
a linear scaling in the number of renormalization steps\r
T = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Thus, distinguishing between area and\r
log-area laws in 1D translates to determining whether the\r
entanglement entropy saturates or grows linearly with\r
increasing T.\r
We experimentally realize spatially infinite MERA\r
with a finite number of layers T. For a bipartition into\r
subsystems A = (−∞, 1] and B = [2, +∞), we im\u0002plement the holographic subsystem tomography as de\u0002scribed in Sec. II and detailed in Appendix A. We pre\u0002pare the MERA circuit within the causal cone of the\r
subsystem boundary, measure the T renormalized sites\r
at the right edge of the cone (Fig. 1), and use the classical\r
shadow method [53] to extract the R´enyi-2 entanglement\r
entropy (2). The finite number of MERA layers limits\r
the maximal correlation length to 3 × 2\r
T\r
. Thus, we ex\u0002perimentally probe effective subsystem sizes ℓ ∝ 2\r
T\r
. See\r
Appendix B for a more detailed argument on this relation\r
of T and effective subsystem sizes.\r
For the non-critical point g = 1.5 of the TFIM (1), the\r
measured half-chain R´enyi-2 entanglement entropy S is\r
shown in Fig. 3(b). We observe a rapid saturation of the\r
entanglement entropy for T ≥ 3, in agreement with the\r
area-law. This is expected as, due to the energy gap,\r
the physical correlation length ξ is finite. Here, addi\u0002tional MERA layers (T > 3) have a negligible effect on\r
the groundstate approximation and entanglement for this\r
gapped system. Our error model indicates that, in this\r
regime, SPAM errors and gate rotation errors due to the\r
ions’ axial motion are the dominant noise sources.\r
At criticality (g = 1), the system has gapless excita\u0002tions, and the correlation length diverges (ξ → ∞). Here,\r
we model the ground state using a scale-invariant MERA\r
with an infinite number of homogeneous identical layers\r
in both the spatial and preparation directions [35, 36].\r
Directly preparing a scale-invariant MERA is not exper\u0002imentally feasible. Instead, we truncate at layer T and\r

Recall that we determine ˆϱB through tomography on\r

Mølmer-Sørensen gates with typical absolute rotation an\u0002gles in the range from 0.01π to 0.2π, which are much\r
smaller than those of fully entangling gates. As Mølmer\u0002Sørensen gate errors decrease with the rotation angle,\r
this leads to significantly reduced experimental errors.\r
Appendix F provides a breakdown of error contributions\r
and explains how the infidelity scales with experimental\r
errors.\r
IV. OUTLOOK\r
We employed MERA on an ion-trap quantum com\u0002puter to clearly resolve the quantum phase transition in a\r
condensed matter system, successfully capturing the uni\u0002versal properties of Ising-class physics. Furthermore, our\r
holographic subsystem tomography method made it pos\u0002sible to demonstrate the transition from area-law to log\u0002area-law scaling in groundstate entanglement entropies.\r
This entanglement scaling transition is a hallmark of\r
quantum many-body physics with no classical analog. Its\r
experimental observation had previously faced substan\u0002tial challenges including finite-size effects and attainable\r
fidelities.\r
The investigation of more complicated models, includ\u0002ing systems with higher spin and spatial dimensions, re\u0002quires larger MERA bond dimensions χ ≳ 8. In classical\r
MERA simulations, the primary bottleneck are tensor\r
contractions, whose cost scales as O(χ\r
r\r
), where the ex\u0002ponent r depends on the spatial dimension D and specific\r
MERA structure. In 1D with r = 7, . . . , 9, these costs\r
are still tractable for moderate bond dimensions χ ≲ 20\r
[22–24]. However, for higher-dimensional systems such\r
as (quasi-)2D frustrated quantum magnets and fermionic\r
systems, where quantum Monte Carlo generally fails due

8\r
to the negative sign problem, the classical contraction\r
costs with scaling exponents r = 16, . . . , 26 become pro\u0002hibitive even for small χ [24, 61].\r
To avoid these high contraction costs, our prior\r
work [25, 26] proposed implementing (Trotterized)\r
MERA on quantum computers. As discussed in Refs. [25,\r
26, 28], the required qubit count grows only logarithmi\u0002cally with χ and is independent of system size if mid\u0002circuit resets are available. The circuit depth scales as\r
O(T t), where the number of MERA layers T ∼ log ξ gov\u0002erns the maximal correlated length ξ, and t is a tunable\r
Trotter depth that controls the expressiveness of sub\u0002circuits in individual tensors. For example, simulating\r
a large (e.g., hundreds-by-hundreds) 2D system with a\r
2 × 2 7→ 1 MERA using χ = 8, T = 6, and t = 2 re\u0002quires either (i) 108 resettable qubits and a circuit depth\r
of 96 when minimizing depth or (ii) 42 qubits and depth\r
624 when minimizing the qubit count. Such circuits are\r
not classically tractable, yet they are realistic for state\u0002of-the-art quantum hardware.\r
Recent advances in trapped-ion platforms have\r
brought these capabilities closer to realization. For exam\u0002ple, 56-qubit systems with ≥99.8% two-qubit gate fidelity\r
are now available [62], and circuits with over 2000 two\u0002qubit gates have been demonstrated [63]. Larger systems,\r
with ∼ 200 qubits, can be achieved by scaling up the\r
system used in this work [64]. The primary error source\r
in high-connectivity long ion chains—motional heating\r
of low-frequency modes—can be reduced by over two or\u0002ders of magnitude using cryogenic techniques and sympa\u0002thetic cooling with a different isotopic species [65]. This\r
approach also facilitates qubit reset and reuse, further\r
enhancing scalability.\r
Since MERA has been rigorously proven to be free of\r
barren plateaus [30, 31], the variational optimization of\r
MERA on quantum computers is feasible, and we have\r
substantiated a polynomial quantum advantage, which\r
is particularly pronounced in D ≥ 2 spatial dimensions\r
[26].\r
Once an optimized MERA state is determined, rich\r
physics can be probed through local observables, cor\u0002relators, and entanglement measures. Measuring local\r
observables and correlators is straightforward, requir\u0002ing similar resources as energy estimation. Probing en\u0002tanglement is more demanding, as large-χ MERA in\u0002volve multiple qubits per renormalized site, making holo\u0002graphic subsystem tomography costly. To address this,\r
one can perform randomized measurements on edges of\r
the boundary causal cones, and adopt the idea of en\u0002tanglement Hamiltonian tomography [17, 60] to learn\r
the renormalized entanglement Hamiltonian, assuming a\r
structured form in terms of renormalized degrees of free\u0002dom.\r
Beyond the study of strongly correlated many-body\r
ground states, MERA states can serve as high-quality\r
starting points for the investigation of nonequilibrium dy\u0002namics. As demonstrated in this work, MERA accurately\r
captures both critical and non-critical ground states. A\r
natural extension is to prepare a MERA state and evolve\r
it under quench or Floquet dynamics. Since entangle\u0002ment growth under nonequilibrium dynamics generally\r
leads to volume-law scaling of entanglement entropies, a\r
quantum advantage is expected as soon as we surpass\r
the realm of exact classical Krylov-subspace methods for\r
≳36 qubits.\r

|Ψ⟩ for the ground state and a spatial bipartition into\r
subsystem A and its complement B.\r
The goal of the holographic subsystem tomography is\r
to efficiently access the reduced density matrix ˆϱB =\r
TrA |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| of subsystem B in the experiment. The iso\u0002metric property (Wˆ †Wˆ = 1) of the MERA tensors im\u0002plies that, under the partial trace TrA, all tensors out\u0002side the causal cone of B can be removed, as exemplified\r
by the shaded area atop subsystem A in Fig. 5. Fur\u0002thermore, the aforementioned quantities are all invariant\r
under unitary transformations on subsystem B. Using\r
this invariance, we can remove all MERA gates outside\r
the causal cone of subsystem A, which corresponds to\r
the action of the unitary transformation Uˆ †\r
B from Sec. II.\r
Only the gates inside the causal cone(s) of the subsys\u0002tem boundary(ies) remain. All qubits outside this causal\r
cone are in the reference state |0⟩ and need not be im\u0002plemented in the experiment."""

we consider either infinite chains with a bipartition into\r
two semi-infinite subsystems, or finite chains with peri\u0002odic boundary conditions where block B is large enough\r

Appendix C: Scale-invariant MERA\r
Scale-invariant MERA are designed for critical sys\u0002tems, where correlation lengths diverge. As shown in\r
Fig. 6(a), they feature an elementary cell of tensors that\r
repeats in the spatial and renormalization directions, in\r
accordance with the self-similarity of critical systems.\r
Viewed in the renormalization direction, the scale\u0002invariant MERA maps the local Hamiltonian of a crit\u0002ical system into an RG fixed point. Seen in reverse, the\r
scale-invariant MERA acts as a quantum channel that\r
iteratively refines the state, starting from an initial ref\u0002erence state and adding layers to construct the ground\r
state of the critical system.\r
Consider spin sites 0 and 1. Their causal-cone state\r
as indicated by the unshaded region in Fig.6(a) is con\u0002structed by applying the same layer-transition channel\r
M (Fig. 6(b)) multiple times, where renormalized sites\r
that leave the causal cone are traced out. M is a quan\u0002tum channel and can be diagonalized in bi-orthonormal\r
operator bases such that\r
M(·) = |ϱˆsteady⟩⟩⟨⟨1| +\r

i>0\r
mi|rˆi⟩⟩⟨⟨ˆℓi|, (C1)\r
where |mi| < 1 for all i > 0, and we use a super-bra\u0002ket notation for the operator-basis elements according to\r
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product ⟨⟨Lˆ|Rˆ⟩⟩ := Tr\u0010\r
Lˆ†Rˆ\r
\u0011\r

With ˆr0 ≡ ϱˆsteady and ˆℓ0 ≡ 1, ˆri and ˆℓi are the right\r
and left eigen-operators of M for eigenvalue mi and obey\r
⟨⟨ˆℓi|rˆj ⟩⟩ = δi,j .\r
We initialize the MERA in the product state |0⟩ =\r
|0, . . . , 0⟩ at the topmost (infinite) layer. The expectation\r
value of a local observable Oˆ\r

See Fig. 6(d). Experimentally, we cannot directly imple\u0002ment MERA with an infinite number of layers. Instead,\r

FIG. 6. Scale-invariant MERA and its implementation on the quantum computer. (a) A scale-invariant binary\r
1D MERA with an infinite number of lattice sites and layers. All unitaries (bare rectangles) and isometries (rectangles with\r

consisting of a repeating configuration of tensors in each layer. The corresponding repeated layer-transition channel M(·) maps\r
reduced density matrices from the top to the bottom layer. Stars indicate complex conjugation. (c) The shown doubled and\r
SWAP-contracted layer-transition map D can be used to compute the second-order R´enyi entanglement entropy of a bipartition\r
into subsystems (−∞, 1] and [2, ∞) (see panel f). (d) Causal-cone tensor-network for the evaluation of local expectation values\r
on sites 0 and 1. The MERA circuit is initialized with reference state |0⟩ at the top layer. (e) In the experiment, we truncate\r
the scale-invariant MERA after layer T. For the measurement of local observables, the top layer is optimized to approximate\r
the dominant eigenmode ˆρsteady := limT→∞ MT(|0⟩⟨0|) of the layer-transition channel. Finally, we measure the qubits at sites\r
0 and 1. (f) The tensor network for the purity of the reduced density operator of subsystem [2, ∞). (g) In this case, the top\r

tomography on T qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone circuit (see also Fig. 5).

To account for layer truncations in the study of sub\u0002system purity and entanglement, we introduce a dou\u0002bled SWAP-contracted layer-transition map D as shown\r
in Fig. 6(c). For a scale-invariant MERA truncated af\u0002ter layer T and initialized with the reference state |0⟩,\r

constant in each renormalization step.\r
Even with the small bond dimension χ = 2, the domi\u0002nant eigenvalue d0 of D in the optimized scale invariant\r
MERA agrees well with the conformal field theory pre\u0002diction for the Ising model with central charge c = 1/2:\r
−8 log2 d0 = 0.475 . . . ≈ c. (C5)\r
Again, we truncate the scale-invariant MERA after\r
layer T ≤ 4 for experiments. To mitigate the effect of\r
the truncation, we do not initialize with the reference\r
state |0⟩ at the top layer but with a more suitable two\u0002site state |φ⟩, generated from |0⟩ through one entangling\r
and further single-qubit gates. These gates are chosen to\r
suppress subleading contributions in (C4) by minimiz\u0002ing P\r

(C6)\r
After implementing such T-layer approximations of a\r
scale-invariant MERA in the experiment, we perform\r
the holographic subsystem tomography, measuring all T\r
qubits at the right edge of the boundary causal-cone as\r
discussed in Sec. A and illustrated in Fig. 6(g).\r
Appendix D: Gate compilation and circuit examples\r
In the main text and previous appendices, we showed\r
tensor network diagrams of MERA and schematic gate\r
decompositions of individual tensors. Here, we demon\u0002strate how to compile these into native quantum gates\r
and provide concrete circuit examples for measuring both\r
local observables and nonlocal entanglement properties.\r
As shown in Fig. 7(a), a generic 4-by-4 unitary oper\u0002ation can be decomposed into a two-qubit circuit using\r
3 entangling gates and 12 single-qubit gates, involving a\r
total of 15 parameters (up to a global phase). However,\r
this generic decomposition turns out to be unnecessary\r
for our MERA circuits. For example, in a network of\r
such two-qubit unitaries, redundant single-qubit gates on\r
connected bonds can be eliminated. More importantly, a\r
physically motivated ansatz should preserve the symme\u0002tries of the Hamiltonian, except in cases of spontaneous\r
symmetry breaking.\r
For the transverse-field Ising model studied here, the\r
ground state exhibits time-reversal symmetry (invariance\r
under complex conjugation in the computational basis)\r
for all values of g and a Z2 symmetry when g ≤ 1. While\r
a global symmetry does not necessarily imply local sym\u0002metry, we find that, in our case, it does hold locally. A\r
suitable choice of entangling gates that respect the sym\u0002metries of the Ising model includes XY (θ) = e−iθXˆ⊗Y / ˆ 2\r
and YX(θ) = e−iθYˆ ⊗X/ˆ 2, which are real in the compu\u0002tational basis and respect the model’s Z2 symmetry as\r
[⊗iZˆ\r
i\r
, XY (θ)] = 0. Based on this, we replace XX and\r
Y Y gates with XY and YX gates. We remove ZZ and\r
single-qubit Z gates as they violate time-reversal sym\u0002metry. Variable Ry(θ) = e−iθY / ˆ 2 gates are retained in\r
some tensors to allow for spontaneous breaking of the Z2\r
symmetry. The Ry gates that have been removed only\r
have a relatively small effect on the accuracy.\r
The resulting refined gate compilation for a unit cell\r
in the binary MERA, including one isometry and one\r
unitary (dis)entangler, is shown in Fig. 7(b). This\r
symmetry-respecting compilation significantly reduces\r
the parameter space and redundancy without sacrific\u0002ing expressiveness in approximating the ground state, as\r
confirmed by our numerical simulations. Since binary\r
MERA with one qubit per bond is classically simula\u0002ble, we do not implement the variational MERA on the\r
quantum computer. Instead, we classically optimize the\r
MERA with the gate configuration in Fig. 7(b). Notably,\r
while the Ry gate is retained for all values of g, the op\u0002timized angles are non-zero only when g < 1 within our\r
data points, which is consistent with the presence of a\r
non-zero order parameter in the ferromagnetic phase.\r
In our experimental setup, the native entangling gate is\r
the XX gate. As shown in Fig. 7(c), we convert the XY\r
and YX gates into native gates by appending additional\r
virtual Rz(±\r
π\r
2\r
) rotations, which are effectively free, as\r
mentioned in Sec. II C.\r

State preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors\r
contribute significantly to our error budget. To quan\u0002tify the probability pd of SPAM errors for the dark state\r
(|0⟩), we performed fluorescence detection after initial\u0002izing all qubits via the usual optical pumping, yielding\r
an average measured error of 0.16% (see Fig. 8 for de\u0002tailed SPAM errors). To measure the probability pb of\r
SPAM errors for the bright state (|1⟩), we applied Ry(π)\r
gates following the optical pumping and then performed\r
fluorescence detection, yielding an average measured er\u0002ror of 0.45% (see Fig. 8 for detailed SPAM errors). We\r
checked the rotation error of the Ry(π) gates by applying\r
nine consecutive Ry(π)-gates, yielding a population error\r
of 0.56+0.17\r
−0.12% as determined by the binomial proportion\u0002ate 95% confidence interval using the Clopper-Pearson\r
method. The population error resulting from single-qubit\r
gates should scale superlinearly with the number N of\r
gates, corresponding to a mixture of uncorrelated and\r
correlated noise. Our results imply a population error\r
below 10−3 per π-gate, which is below the determined\r
bright-state SPAM error.\r
The measurement error for the 171Yb+ hyperfine\r
qubits arises from optical pumping between the hyper\u0002fine states during the optical detection pulse [66, 67]. We\r
fit the measured photon count statistics at various detec\u0002tion time τ to an optical pumping model as discussed\r
below to determine the state preparation error and the\r
measurement errors.\r
The distributions of detection counts for a single ion\r
prepared in the bright state for different detection times\r
are shown in Fig. 9(a). Ideally, the ion would cycle be\u0002tween the |S, F = 1⟩ and |P, F = 0⟩ manifolds, resulting\r
in a Poisson distribution of the recorded photon counts.\r
However, the bright state can be off-resonantly pumped\r

a. Axial motion\r
Axial motion of our 15-ion chain, dominated by the\r
lowest-frequency axial mode (mode 0) with angular fre\u0002quency ω0 = 2π × 241.8 kHz, is a leading error source in\r
our platform. This motion misaligns the ions relative to\r
the tightly-focused addressing beams, causing gate errors\r
[65]. These errors increase over time as the ions’ motion\r
is driven by noisy electric fields.\r
We quantified the addressing error after a wait time t\r
following laser cooling by applying a variable number N\r
of XX(\r
π\r
2\r
) gates of total duration ∆t to ions i and j and\r
measuring the mean population P|11⟩ of the |1, 1⟩ state.\r
The recorded populations P|11⟩ as a function of N for\r
(i, j) = (3, −3) are shown in the inset of Fig. 12. Uncer\u0002tainty in the ions’ axial motion translates into a variance\r
in the total XX rotation angle, leading to damping of\r
P|11⟩ oscillations.\r
The observed damping is governed by the statistics of\r
the phonon number of mode 0 during gate application\r
[65]. We model the evolution of the phonon number nt\r
at time t as a biased random walk. Since the energy of\r
mode 0 following laser cooling corresponds to hundreds\r
of phonons, and the average heating per XX gate corre\u0002sponds to more than 20 phonons, we coarse-grain nt on\r
intervals of size δn with 1 ≤ δn ≪ 2nt and model the\r

We describe X-errors during an XX(θ) gate on ion pair\r

EX(ˆρ) = (1 − pX)ˆρ + pXXˆρˆX, ˆ (E8)\r
where pX ≡ pX,i,j (θ) is the X-flip probability per gate.\r
X-errors can be caused by residual spin-motion en\u0002tanglement at the end of Mølmer-Sørensen gates. They\r
can be minimized by carefully choosing the motional de\u0002tuning, gate duration, and envelope of the amplitude\u0002modulated gate waveforms [70]. In-between experiment\r
runs, we stabilized frequencies of the radial ion-motion\r
modes via blue-sideband Ramsey spectroscopy. Each of\r
the central 11 qubits was used to query one of 11 radial\r
modes that are addressed by the entangling gate wave\u0002forms. The obtained spectroscopical data was used to\r
automatically adjust the quadratic and quartic terms in\r
the static axial potential of the trap and a common mo\u0002tional offset frequency for all gates.\r

π\r
2\r
) gates into a Ram\u0002sey pulse sequence consisting of initial Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) and final\r
Rz(ϕ)−Ry(\r
π\r
2\r
) pulses applied to each targeted ion. After\r
adjusting the qubit frequencies during the gate to com\u0002pensate for the measured shifts, we use the same sequence\r
to estimate any residual gate Z-errors.\r
The fitted contrast of the obtained Ramsey fringes for a\r
sample gate is shown in Fig. 14(a). The observed depen\u0002dence of the contrast on N is roughly quadratic, indicat\u0002ing that the phase shift error accumulates coherently as\r
the number of gates increases. We model the observed de\u0002coherence by correlated fluctuations in the gate-induced\r
Stark shift, which can arise from fluctuations in the am\u0002plitude balance of the red and blue tones of the Mølmer\u0002Sørensen gate due to air turbulence in the Raman beam\r
setup. Since our Ramsey sequence prepares the qubits\r
in the X-basis, we do not expect gate X-errors to affect\r
the measured contrast. We assume that the phase shift\r
ϕiinduced on ion i by a fully-entangling XX gate during\r
each shot follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean\r
and standard deviation σ\r
i\r

. This noise model results in a\r
fringe contrast proportional to e−(Nσi\r

data and the fitted values of σ\r

XX gates on the ion pairs used in this work.\r
In the noise-model simulations, for each shot, we sam\u0002ple random numbers s from the Gaussian distribution\r

the ideal XX(θ) gate by\r

with the highest reported infidelity 1 − F (∼ 10−2) and\r
one with the lowest (∼ 10−4).\r
The case of highest reported infidelity corresponds to a\r

our error model and the calibrated parameters provided\r

Hamiltonian, and the bottom row (b,d) shows corresponding state infidelities 1 − F. The left column (a,b) presents results\r
at the critical point g = 1 with T = 4, while the right column (c,d) corresponds to the gapped phase at g = 1.5 with T = 1.\r
Experimental data points with error bars are reproduced from Fig. 4 in the main text. The dashed lines indicate the ideal\r
simulation results from Fig. 4. Noisy simulation results are shown as shaded regions representing the 95% quantiles, with solid\r

sources from Fig. 4. In the “shot only” case, all errors are disabled except for shot noise (the statistical uncertainty due to\r
the finite number of measurement shots). In the remaining cases, the simulations include both the shot noise and the specified\r
individual error source. We run 1000 independent noisy simulation trials for each case. Each trail uses the same number of\r
measurement shots as the experiment: 1,500 shots per basis per trial in the left column, and 8,000 shots per basis per trial in\r
the right column.\r
gates, typically leads to errors on the order of 10−2. After\r
accounting for the error rescaling due to smaller rotation\r
angles in the actual MERA gates and the accumulation\r
of errors throughout the circuit, the overall gate-induced\r
error is also expected to be in the 10−2range. This es\u0002timate is confirmed in Fig. 15(a). A small discrepancy\r
remains between the experimental data and the full-noise\r
simulation, which we attribute to system miscalibration\r
over the long experimental runtime required for 4-qubit\r
tomography, as well as unmodeled single-qubit gate er\u0002rors.\r
The case of lowest reported infidelity corresponds to a\r
single-qubit tomography result on a single-layer MERA\r
circuit in the gapped phase at g = 1.5. The circuit in\u0002volves only 2 qubits and a single XX gate with a rotation\r
amplitude of 0.095π. We performed 8,000 measurement\r
shots for each Pauli-X, -Y , and -Z basis. In this case,\r
the statistical uncertainty from finite sampling is on the\r
order of 10−3 ∼ 10−2, while the SPAM error for a single\r
qubit is on the order of 10−3, and the error from the sin\u0002gle gate is also on the order of 10−3\r
. Hence, we expect\r
the statistical uncertainty to dominate over other error\r
sources, which is consistent with the simulation results\r
shown in Fig. 15(c).\r
We observe that the infidelity is of comparable magni\u0002tude to the errors for the high-infidelity case in Fig. 15(b)\r
and at least an order of magnitude below the error scale\r
for the low-infidelity case in Fig. 15(d). We attribute this\r
to the fact that the infidelity has different scaling behav\u0002ior for rank-deficient and full-rank states: Consider the\r
exact (noise-free) density operator ˆρ and the perturbed\r
version ˆσ = ˆρ + ϵDˆ with noise level ϵ and Tr(Dˆ) = 0.\r
For a full-rank state ˆρ, the perturbed ˆσ remains well\u0002defined (positive semidefinite) for sufficiently small ϵ > 0\r
as well as small ϵ < 0. The infidelity 1 − F(ˆρ, σˆ(ϵ)) is\r
differentiable and minimal at ϵ = 0. This implies that\r
the linear term vanishes and 1 − F = O(ϵ\r
2\r
). This is\r
the case in Fig. 15(d), where the corresponding single\u0002qubit reduced density matrix has full rank with eigenval\u0002ues {0.98, 2.2 × 10−2}. A linear scaling 1 − F = O(ϵ)\r
is only possible for rank-deficient states. For example,\r
consider a pure state ˆρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ| and the perturbation\r
Dˆ = −|ψ⟩⟨ψ| + |ψ⊥⟩⟨ψ⊥| with an orthogonal state |ψ⊥⟩\r
and ϵ ≥ 0. In this case, the infidelity is simply ϵ. In the\r
current experiments, the ideal reduced density matrix is\r
indeed approximately rank-deficient at larger layer num\u0002bers T, and this is the case in Fig. 15(b) with eigenvalues\r
{0.92, 7.9 × 10−2, 3.5 × 10−3, 3.1 × 10−4, 2.7 × 10−4, 2.7 ×\r
