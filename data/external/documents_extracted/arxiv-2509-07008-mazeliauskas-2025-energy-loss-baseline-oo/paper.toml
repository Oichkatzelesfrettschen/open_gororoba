Energy loss baseline for light hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at √\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV\r

(Dated: September 10, 2025)\r
I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and\r
oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV, assuming no final-state\r
interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with state\u0002of-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the\r
nuclear modification factor R\r
h\r
AA in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical\r
uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below 20 GeV. In\r
the intermediate range 20 GeV ≲ p\r
h\r
T ≲ 70 GeV, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to\r
approximately 5%. At higher momenta (p\r
h\r
T ≳ 70 GeV), however, predictions exhibit a marked\r
spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about\r
isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral\r
pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Collisions of ultra-relativistic heavy nuclei at the Rela\u0002tivistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron\r
Collider (LHC) provide a unique window into a novel\r
state of quantum matter, the Quark–Gluon Plasma\r
(QGP), composed of deconfined quark and gluon de\u0002grees of freedom [1]. A key signature of the formation\r
of QGP is the suppression of high-momentum hadron\r
and jet yields (jet quenching). This phenomenon is un\u0002derstood as energy loss of high-momentum partons, pro\u0002duced in initial hard scatterings, through multiple inter\u0002actions with the medium, which leads to a depletion of\r
the observed high-momentum yield [2–4]. A major open\r
question in the field is understanding how different QGP\r
signals, such as jet quenching, evolve with the size of the\r
colliding system [5–7].\r
Strikingly, several signatures traditionally associated\r
with QGP formation, such as azimuthal anisotropies and\r
strangeness enhancement, have been observed even in\r
small systems, such as proton-proton, proton-nucleus,\r
and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [8–11]. How\u0002ever, an unambiguous signal of partonic energy loss has\r
not yet been established in systems with ≲ 30 partic\u0002ipating nucleons. Centrality-selected peripheral heavy\u0002ion collisions (e.g., PbPb at the LHC or AuAu at\r
RHIC) are complicated by significant uncertainties in\r
collision-geometry modelling as well as by centrality\u0002selection biases [12, 13]. Measurements in asymmetric\r
proton–nucleus collisions have so far provided only upper\r
limits on possible jet-quenching effects [14–16]. A notable\r
exception are recent PHENIX results in deuteron–gold\r
collisions, where a suppression of neutral pion produc\u0002tion was observed in the highest event-activity class [17];\r
however, its interpretation in terms of a genuine final\u0002state effect remains under debate [18].\r
Collisions of light ions provide symmetric systems\r
∗ a.mazeliauskas@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de\r
with significant advantages and unique physics oppor\u0002tunities [19–21]. In particular, oxygen ion (16\r
8O) col\u0002lisions involve, on average, ∼ 10 participating nucle\u0002ons, thus bridging the system size range between proton\u0002nucleus and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [22]. In\r
March 2021, RHIC conducted oxygen–oxygen collisions\r
at √\r
sNN = 200 GeV [23]. More recently, in July 2025, the\r
LHC carried out oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon collisions\r
at √sNN = 5.36 TeV, as well as proton–oxygen collisions\r
at √sNN = 9.62 TeV [24, 25]. A pressing open question\r
is whether unambiguous evidence of partonic energy loss\r
can be established in these small collision systems.\r
Selecting central oxygen-oxygen collisions enhances the\r
potential medium-induced energy loss signal. However,\r
such a selection introduces potential biases [26] and, im\u0002portantly, prevents the construction of an accurate the\u0002oretical baseline. Only in minimum-bias collisions can\r
the inclusive high-momentum hadron and jet production\r
be reliably computed using QCD factorization. The stan\u0002dard observable of energy loss is the nuclear modification\r
factor RAA, which is the ratio of pT spectra in nucleus\u0002nucleus and proton-proton collisions scaled by the num\u0002ber of binary collisions [2–4]. In minimum-bias collisions\r
RAA can be written as a ratio of pT -differential cross\r
sections (for some rapidity window |y| < ymax):\r
RAA ≡\r

dσOO/dpT\r
dσpp/dpT\r
. (1)\r
where A = 16 is the nuclear mass number.\r
In this work, I compute the perturbative QCD base\u0002line, i.e., the expectation in the absence of medium\u0002induced energy loss, for the nuclear modification fac\u0002tor Rh\r
AA of single-inclusive charged hadrons and neu\u0002tral pions in minimum-bias oxygen–oxygen collisions at\r
√\r

final-state effects indicative of QGP formation. Since\r
the expected energy-loss signal is small, it is essential\r
to quantify theoretical uncertainties in the baseline of\r
Eq. (1) with high accuracy. To this end, I perform\r
next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative QCD calcula\u0002tions using state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution\r
functions (nPDFs) and hadron fragmentation functions\r
(FFs). This work updates the previous baseline esti\u0002mate of Ref. [27] with latests nPDFs, FFs and the actual\r
LHC centre-of-mass energy for oxygen–oxygen collisions.\r
Baseline estimates for charged hadron Rh\r
AA for RHIC en\u0002ergies can be found in Ref. [28]. Baseline computations\r
for inclusive jet R\r
j\r
AA and semi-inclusive jet- and hadron\u0002triggered nuclear modification factors were recently pre\u0002sented in Ref. [29]. Although a statistically significant\r
deviation between the no-quenching baseline and experi\u0002mental data would suffice to establish energy loss in oxy\u0002gen–oxygen collisions, interpreting such a signal requires\r
dedicated model predictions. These have been developed\r
in the literature [30–37] and are not discussed in this pa\u0002per.\r
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, I\r
describe the computational framework and present a val\u0002idation plot. Section III contains the baseline results for\r
the charged-hadron and neutral-pion nuclear modifica\u0002tion factor RAA. For completeness, I also provide the\r
absolute cross-section predictions for proton–proton and\r
oxygen–oxygen collisions separately. The conclusions are\r
summarised in Section IV. Additional results for differ\u0002ent rapidity selections are shown in Section A, while Sec\u0002tion B discusses the role of isospin symmetry in fragmen\u0002tation functions.\r
II. COMPUTATIONAL SETUP\r
A. Inclusive hadron cross-section\r
According to QCD factorisation, the perturbative\r
single-inclusive hadronic cross section is given by the con\u0002volution of parton distribution functions, hard partonic\r
cross section and fragmentation functions [38, 39]\r

Here f\r
A\r
i\r
and f\r
B\r
j\r
are parton distribution functions (PDFs)\r
for nucleus A and B and partons i and j at factoriza\u0002tion scale µF . In this paper, I consider only symmetric\r
collision systems, i.e., A = B = p or A = B = 16\r
8O.\r
σˆ\r
ij→l\r
is the partonic cross-section ij → l, which is com\u0002puted at leading (LO) and next-to-leading (NLO) order\r
at renormalization scale µR. Finally, Dh\r
l\r
is the parton l\r
fragmentation function (FF) into a hadron species h at\r
fragmentation scale µF F . I consider two cases: fragmen\u0002tation to charged hadrons and fragmentation to neutral\r
pions, i.e., h = π\r
0\r
.\r
I evaluated Eq. (2) using INCNLO program [40]2 mod\u0002ified to use LHAPDF grids [41] for parton distribution\r
and fragmentation functions. Modifications were checked\r
against an independent LO implementation of the hadron\r
cross-section formula [27]. INCNLO computes the hadron\r
cross section differentially in transverse momentum pT ,\r
but averaged in the azimuth and rapidity |y| < ymax,\r
i.e., dσh/(2πpT dpT dy). The factorisation, renormalisa\u0002tion, and fragmentation scales are chosen to be equal to\r
hadron transverse momentum µF = µR = µF F = p\r
h\r
T\r
.\r
To estimate uncertainties from missing higher order\r
terms, I vary µF , µR and µF F by a factor 2 up and\r
down with a condition that no two scales are varied up\r
and down at the same time (15-point scale uncertainty\r
prescription). Although scale uncertainties do not have\r
probabilistic interpretation [42], the nested LO and NLO\r
scale uncertainties are conventionally used to assess the\r
perturbative convergence of the observable.\r
To estimate uncertainties from (nuclear) parton dis\u0002tribution functions, I use three sets of proton and oxy\u0002gen PDFs: EPPS21 [43], which uses CT18ANLO [44]\r
as a proton PDF baseline, nNNPDF3.0 [45], which\r
is matched to NNPDF3.1 [46] proton PDF, and\r
TUJU21 [47], which simultaneously determines nucleus\r
and proton PDFs. All three nPDF determinations\r
include experimental data from measurements in pPb\r
collisions at the LHC: W± and Z boson production\r
(TUJU21, EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); dijet and D-meson\r
data (EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); isolated photon measure\u0002ments (nNNPDF3.0). Each nPDF extraction is accom\u0002panied by a large set of PDF variations, which can be\r
used to determine the confidence intervals for the com\u0002puted cross section. For each PDF in an error set, I re\u0002peat the cross-section computation and use the built-in\r
LHAPDF functionality to compute 68% confidence inter\u0002vals. Note that no data with oxygen nucleus is included\r
in the fits, and oxygen nPDFs are determined by interpo\u0002lation in nuclear mass number A. Comparison between\r
different collaborations shows how robust this extraction\r
is with respect to changes in the input data, fitting tech\u0002niques, and nPDF parametrisation.\r
To estimate uncertainties from the choice of fragmen\u0002tation functions, I used three choices of fragmentation\r
functions: Binnewies-Kniehl-Kramer (BKK) [48] FFs,\r
which is a built-in option in INCNLO, NNFF1.1h[49]3 and\r
NPC23 [50] FFs. BKK fits charged pion and kaon FFs\r
to √\r
s = 29 GeV e\r
+e− annihilation data. The charged\r
hadron FFs are formed as a sum of charged pion and\r
kaon FFs. Pion contribution is increased by a factor 1.16\r
to mimic (anti)proton contribution. NNFF1.1h charged\r
hadron FFs are obtained from a direct fit to charged\r
hadron data from a large set of single-inclusive e\r
+e− an\u00022 http://lapth.cnrs.fr/PHOX_FAMILY/readme_inc.html\r

in the erratum. I used corrected nPDF grids available at https:\r

nihilation (SIA) and pp collisions. Notably, NNFF1.1h\r
includes LHC charged hadron data at centre of mass en\u0002ergies √\r
s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV. NPC23 performs global\r
analysis of a wide range of precision measurements from\r
the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions\r
and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. NPC23 in\u0002cludes both identified hadron (π\r
±, K±, p(¯p)) and charged\r
hadron data at LHC up to √\r
s = 13 TeV. Charged\r
hadron FFs are a sum of fitted charged pion, kaon, and\r
(anti)proton FFs. We also use neutral pion FFs con\u0002structed from NPC23 charged pion FFs using isospin\r
symmetry [51]4. NNFF1.1h and NPC23 provide FF error\r
sets, which are used to compute 68% confidence intervals.\r
BKK FFs do not include uncertainty estimates, and only\r
scale uncertainties are shown.\r
In the ratio of cross sections Eq. (1), one can expect a\r
significant cancellation between common sources of theo\u0002retical uncertainties in proton and oxygen cross sections.\r
Therefore, the scale uncertainty of RAA is determined\r
by the simultaneous variation of µF , µR and µF F in the\r
numerator and denominator. Cross sections for different\r
members of the oxygen nPDF error set are also matched\r
to the corresponding error set members in the proton\r
baseline, maximising the uncertainty cancellation. For\r
NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs, uncertainties in RAA are\r
computed by taking the cross-section ratio for each mem\u0002ber in the error set and then applying the corresponding\r
uncertainty prescription.\r
B. Validation\r
To validate numerical setup, I computed inclusive\r
hadron cross section in proton-proton collisions at √\r
s =\r
5.02 TeV, 6 GeV < ph\r
T < 50 GeV and |y| < 0.8 using\r
CT18ANLO PDF (central value) with BKK, NNFF1.1h\r
and NPC23 FFs (c.f. Ref. [53]). The results are shown in\r
Fig. 1 and compared to experimental measurements by\r
ALICE [52]. The pT -binned cross section was obtained\r
using a three-point Gauss–Legendre quadrature to eval\u0002uate the momentum integrals. Note that ALICE reports\r
the averaged hadron yield in pp collisions, which can be\r
converted to the cross section by scaling it with inelastic\r
pp cross section σNN = 67.3 ± 1.2 mb [13]. The black\r
bands and black error points correspond to experimen\u0002tal systematic and statistical uncertainties, respectively\r
(uncertainty in σNN is neglected). The lower panel shows\r
the ratio to NLO BKK FF results.\r
The brown and red colour bands indicate the LO\r
and NLO scale uncertainties computed with CT18ANLO\r
PDFs and BKK FFs. The NLO band ranges from ∼ 10%\r
in the highest momentum bin to almost 50% in the low\u0002est momentum bin. The NLO central value is within the\r

(large) LO scale band. Experimental data points are be\u0002low NLO BKK expectations, even taking into account\r
the scale uncertainty (see also Refs. [53, 54]). However,\r
the ratio is approximately constant, which indicates that\r
a suitable choice of fragmentation scale can better repro\u0002duce the spectra, see Ref. [55].\r
In cyan and olive bands, I show 68% confidence in\u0002tervals computed with NNFF1.1h and NPC23 charged\r
hadron FFs. NNFF1.1h results are only slightly shifted\r
above the data. NPC23 results have a smaller uncer\u0002tainty band, but the momentum dependence is different\r
from the one observed in data. Taking into account the\r
scale uncertainty, NNFF1.1h and NPC23 results are in\r
good agreement with experimental data, which is not sur\u0002prising, since these FFs are fitted to LHC proton-proton\r
data. Finally, I note that proton PDFs are much bet\u0002ter constrained than FFs, and the corresponding (much\r
smaller) uncertainty is not shown in Fig. 1. See the pre\u0002dictions at √\r
s = 5.36 TeV in Section III B and Ref. [53]\r
for proton PDF uncertainties in the spectrum.

III. RESULTS\r
A. Nuclear modification factor\r
In Fig. 2, I present the no-quenching baseline results\r
for the charged-hadron nuclear modification factor Rh\r
AA\r
in oxygen–oxygen collisions at √s = 5.36 TeV, within the\r
kinematic range |y| < 0.8 and 4 GeV < pT < 200 GeV.\r
Additional results for other rapidity intervals are pro\u0002vided in Section A.\r
The brown and red shaded bands indicate the LO and\r
NLO scale uncertainties, computed with EPPS21 nPDFs\r
and BKK FFs. At pT ≳ 20 GeV, these uncertainties can\u0002cel efficiently in the ratio, and the NLO band becomes\r
comparable to the line thickness. At lower pT , scale un\u0002certainties grow more noticeable, yet the NLO band re\u0002mains fully nested within the LO band, reflecting good\r
perturbative convergence.\r
The hatched red, blue, and orange bands correspond\r
to the 68% confidence intervals of EPPS21, TUJU21,\r
and nNNPDF3.0 nPDFs (all with BKK FFs). For\r
pT ≳ 20 GeV, the three nPDFs are consistent, with\r
overlapping uncertainty bands. In the range 20 GeV ≲\r
pT ≲ 100 GeV, EPPS21 gives the widest uncertainty\r
band (∼ 5%), while for pT ≳ 100 GeV, nNNPDF3.0 be\u0002comes slightly broader. TUJU21 shows the narrowest\r
uncertainties, though this reflects its limited dataset and\r
restrictive parametrisation [47]. Interestingly, the central\r
values of all three nPDFs yield Rh\r
AA > 1 in the interval\r
30 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 120 GeV, though still consistent with\r
unity within EPPS21 and nNNPDF3.0 uncertainties.\r

5.36 TeV for |y| < 0.8. Coloured bands indicate scale varia\u0002tions, while the hatched band shows the 68% confidence in\u0002terval of EPPS21 nPDFs.\r
At lower momenta (pT ≲ 20 GeV), nPDF uncertainties\r
increase, and differences between the extractions become\r
more pronounced. TUJU21 and nNNPDF3.0 remain cen\u0002tred near unity, whereas the EPPS21 band drops below\r
unity for pT ≲ 10 GeV. Thus, experimental observations\r
of Rh\r
AA < 1 in this region would not unambiguously sig\u0002nal medium-induced energy loss.\r
Next, I examine the sensitivity to fragmentation func\u0002tions (FFs). The cyan and olive bands show the 68%\r
confidence intervals for NNFF1.1h and NPC23 charged\u0002hadron FFs. For both uncertainty cancellation is ex\u0002cellent with bands barely wider than the line thickness\r
across the full pT range. Results with NPC23 closely\r
match those with BKK FFs, whereas NNFF1.1h exhibits\r
striking deviations: at pT ≳ 70 GeV, Rh\r
AA falls well be\u0002low unity. As discussed in Section B, this originates\r
from strong isospin breaking in NNFF1.1h, where down\u0002quark fragmentation is significantly suppressed. Since\r
oxygen nuclei contain a larger fraction of down quarks,\r
the hadron yield is reduced at high pT , where quark frag\u0002mentation dominates [30]. Such strong isospin break\u0002ing is unexpected, given that charged hadrons are domi\u0002nated by pions. Nevertheless, in the intermediate region\r
(20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV), differences between FF sets\r
remain below 5%.\r
The black dashed line in Fig. 2 shows the central pre\u0002diction for the neutral-pion RAA obtained with NPC23\r
FFs. It closely follows the charged-hadron Rh\r
AA with the\r
same FF set, as expected, since charged-hadron produc\u0002tion is pion-dominated and the neutral-pion FFs are con\u0002structed from charged-pion FFs.\r

cross section does not include final state modification and is normalised by A\r
2\r
.\r
5.36 TeV5. The ratio agrees with unity to within 1%\r
over most of the momentum range. This reflects the fact\r
that the nuclear mass number dependence is poorly con\u0002strained in current nPDFs, leading to strongly correlated\r
and nearly identical modifications for oxygen and neon.\r
Consequently, the nuclear modification factor baseline for\r
neon–neon collisions can be taken as essentially identical\r
to that for oxygen–oxygen within current knowledge of\r
nPDFs.\r

in minimum-bias (left) pp and (right) oxygen–oxygen col\u0002lisions at √\r

NLO prediction obtained with BKK FFs, using (left)\r
CT18ANLO PDFs and (right) EPPS21 nPDFs.\r

high momenta, the NLO uncertainty reduces to ∼ 15%.\r
For pp, the PDF uncertainties are below 4% (not shown\r
in Fig. 1). The results with CT18ANLO and nNNPDF3.0\r
are in good agreement, while TUJU21 exhibits a differ\u0002ent trend, crossing the other two around p\r
h\r
T ∼ 50 GeV.\r
For OO collisions, EPPS21 nPDF uncertainties are sub\u0002stantially larger, exceeding 5%, and are mostly consistent\r
with nNNPDF3.0 results, while TUJU21 again shows a\r
distinct momentum dependence.\r
Finally, sizeable discrepancies arise between BKK,\r
NNFF1.0h, and NPC23 FFs, which are not covered by\r
the uncertainty bands of NNFF1.0h and NPC23. Pre\u0002dictions with NNFF1.0h lie about 25% below those with\r
BKK, while the NPC23-to-BKK ratio exhibits a pro\u0002nounced momentum dependence. Nevertheless, all FF\r
sets remain mutually consistent once the NLO scale un\u0002certainty is taken into account.\r
IV. CONCLUSIONS\r
In July 2025 the LHC collided oxygen ions for the first\r
time, providing a unique opportunity to search for an un\u0002ambiguous signal of jet quenching in a system with, on\r
average, only about ten participating nucleons. Because\r
the expected signal is small, it is essential to quantify\r
precisely the difference in the initial perturbative produc\u0002tion of high-momentum partons between oxygen–oxygen\r
and proton–proton collisions. To this end, I have car\u0002ried out a systematic study of the no-quenching baseline\r
for the single-inclusive hadron nuclear modification fac-

6\r
tor, Rh\r
AA, in minimum-bias oxygen–oxygen collisions at\r
√\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV. Using state-of-the-art nuclear parton\r
distribution functions (nPDFs) and fragmentation func\u0002tions (FFs), I have provided a robust estimate of the\r
theoretical uncertainties associated with this baseline.\r
In the momentum window 20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV, the\r
baseline can be controlled at the ∼ 5% level, with nPDFs\r
representing the dominant source of uncertainty. At\r
lower and higher pT , however, the combined nPDF and\r
FF uncertainties become sizeable, potentially limiting the\r
ability to disentangle medium effects from the baseline.\r
The difference between neutral-pion and charged-hadron\r
Rh\r
AA is negligible compared with the nPDF uncertainties,\r
indicating that both observables are equally suitable for\r
probing medium-induced energy loss.\r
The largest systematic uncertainty in charged-hadron\r
Rh\r
AA, particularly at low pT , stems from the limited\r
knowledge of oxygen nPDFs. The large pO dataset re\u0002cently collected at the LHC will be crucial for constrain\u0002ing oxygen nPDFs in future global fits [56]. At high\r
pT , I find non-negligible discrepancies between different\r
FF extractions, which appear to originate from isospin\u0002symmetry breaking in some sets. These discrepancies will\r
hopefully be resolved in future global FF analyses, poten\u0002tially aided by input from hadron spectra in pA collisions.\r
In parallel, theoretical advances in charged hadron com\u0002putations—NNLO accuracy in hadronic collisions [57]\r
and N3LO in electron–positron annihilation [58]—are\r
paving the way towards substantially more precise FF\r
determinations.\r
In conclusion, the charged-hadron nuclear modification\r
factor in oxygen–oxygen collisions can be predicted to\r
within ∼ 5% in the most favourable kinematic range.\r
Whether this precision is sufficient to observe a jet\u0002quenching signal in such a small system will also depend\r
on experimental uncertainties and the potential signal\r
size [30–37]. In particular, a new source of experimental\r
uncertainty arises in oxygen beams due to transmuta\u0002tion into other ion species [59]. Finally, the collected\r
oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon data at the same energy\r
provide an additional handle: the ratio of hadron spectra\r
between NeNe and OO collisions would largely cancel the\r
nPDF uncertainties in the perturbative baseline, while\r
still allowing for a potential medium-induced signal [36].\r

In Fig. 5, I present the no-quenching baseline results for\r
the single-inclusive charged-hadron nuclear modification\r
factor Rh\r
AA in oxygen–oxygen collisions at √\r
s = 5.36 TeV\r
for different rapidity ranges, |y| < 0.8, |y| < 1.0, and\r
|y| < 2.5. These intervals correspond to the expected\r
charged-hadron rapidity acceptance of the ALICE [52],\r
CMS [60], and ATLAS [61] detectors. The results for\r
|y| < 0.8, already shown in Fig. 2, are repeated here to\r
facilitate comparison. For |y| < 2.5, results are displayed\r
only up to pT < 85 GeV, matching the anticipated ex\u0002perimental momentum coverage.\r
The brown and red bands indicate the LO and NLO\r
scale uncertainties, computed with EPPS21 nPDFs and\r
BKK FFs, as in Fig. 2. The red hatched band denotes\r
the 68% confidence interval for EPPS21. The results for\r
|y| < 0.8 and |y| < 1.0 are nearly indistinguishable, while\r
for |y| < 2.5 the central value of Rh\r
AA lies closer to unity\r
in the range 40 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 85 GeV.\r
Appendix B: Isospin symmetry breaking in\r
NNFF1.1h fragmentation functions\r
In this section, I discuss the origin of the surprising\r
suppression of Rh\r
AA obtained with NNFF1.1h FFs in\r
Fig. 2.\r
In Fig. 6, I show the charged-hadron fragmentation\r
functions Dh\r

hadron cross section is proportional to the third moment\r
of the FFs, i.e., the area under the z\r

(z) curve.\r
For NPC23, the up- and down-quark FFs are very sim\u0002ilar (Fig. 6). This reflects the fact that NPC23 charged\u0002hadron FFs are dominated by pions, which exhibit a high\r
degree of isospin symmetry [50]. In contrast, NNFF1.1h\r
shows a much smaller down-quark FF compared with\r
the up-quark FF. The flavour separation of quark FFs\r
is poorly constrained by data and typically requires ad\u0002ditional assumptions. In NNFF1.1h [49], flavour sepa\u0002ration was introduced following the procedure for kaons\r
described in Appendix A of Ref. [62]. Since charged kaons\r
are not symmetric under d ↔ u exchange, this approach\r
naturally leads to FFs that violate isospin symmetry.\r
In Fig. 7, I demonstrate that this up–down differ\u0002ence drives the discrepancy observed in Fig. 2. To this\r
end, I performed LO cross-section calculations with mod\u0002ified FFs. The solid lines show Rh\r
AA with the origi\u0002nal NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs combined with EPPS21\r
nPDFs. The dotted lines correspond to computations\r
where the down-quark FF is set equal to the up-quark\r
FF (enforcing strict isospin symmetry). In this case, the\r
NPC23 results remain essentially unchanged and consis\u0002tent with the observed isospin symmetry in Fig. 6. In\r
contrast, the NNFF1.1h results become nearly identi\u0002cal to those of NPC23. Conversely, setting the down\u0002quark FF to zero (maximal isospin asymmetry) leaves\r
NNFF1.1h largely unaffected, while NPC23 develops\r
the anomalous suppression of Rh\r
AA at high momentum.\r
These modifications only affect the high-pT region, since\r
at pT < 50 GeV hadron production is dominated by gluon\r
fragmentation [30].\r

Energy loss baseline for light hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at √\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV\r
Aleksas Mazeliauskas∗\r
Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany\r
(Dated: September 10, 2025)\r
I present predictions for inclusive charged hadron spectra in minimum-bias proton-proton and\r
oxygen-oxygen collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV, assuming no final-state\r
interactions. Using next-to-leading order perturbative QCD matrix elements, along with state\u0002of-the-art (nuclear) parton distribution and fragmentation functions, I establish a baseline for the\r
nuclear modification factor R\r
h\r
AA in oxygen-oxygen collisions in the absence of quenching. Theoretical\r
uncertainties in this baseline are found to be substantial for transverse momenta below 20 GeV. In\r
the intermediate range 20 GeV ≲ p\r
h\r
T ≲ 70 GeV, these uncertainties are significantly reduced to\r
approximately 5%. At higher momenta (p\r
h\r
T ≳ 70 GeV), however, predictions exhibit a marked\r
spread due to differences between fragmentation functions, reflecting varying assumptions about\r
isospin symmetry. Finally, I show that considering neon-neon collisions in the initial state or neutral\r
pions in the final state does not appreciably change the nuclear modification factor.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Collisions of ultra-relativistic heavy nuclei at the Rela\u0002tivistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron\r
Collider (LHC) provide a unique window into a novel\r
state of quantum matter, the Quark–Gluon Plasma\r
(QGP), composed of deconfined quark and gluon de\u0002grees of freedom [1]. A key signature of the formation\r
of QGP is the suppression of high-momentum hadron\r
and jet yields (jet quenching). This phenomenon is un\u0002derstood as energy loss of high-momentum partons, pro\u0002duced in initial hard scatterings, through multiple inter\u0002actions with the medium, which leads to a depletion of\r
the observed high-momentum yield [2–4]. A major open\r
question in the field is understanding how different QGP\r
signals, such as jet quenching, evolve with the size of the\r
colliding system [5–7].\r
Strikingly, several signatures traditionally associated\r
with QGP formation, such as azimuthal anisotropies and\r
strangeness enhancement, have been observed even in\r
small systems, such as proton-proton, proton-nucleus,\r
and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [8–11]. How\u0002ever, an unambiguous signal of partonic energy loss has\r
not yet been established in systems with ≲ 30 partic\u0002ipating nucleons. Centrality-selected peripheral heavy\u0002ion collisions (e.g., PbPb at the LHC or AuAu at\r
RHIC) are complicated by significant uncertainties in\r
collision-geometry modelling as well as by centrality\u0002selection biases [12, 13]. Measurements in asymmetric\r
proton–nucleus collisions have so far provided only upper\r
limits on possible jet-quenching effects [14–16]. A notable\r
exception are recent PHENIX results in deuteron–gold\r
collisions, where a suppression of neutral pion produc\u0002tion was observed in the highest event-activity class [17];\r
however, its interpretation in terms of a genuine final\u0002state effect remains under debate [18].\r
Collisions of light ions provide symmetric systems\r
∗ a.mazeliauskas@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de\r
with significant advantages and unique physics oppor\u0002tunities [19–21]. In particular, oxygen ion (16\r
8O) col\u0002lisions involve, on average, ∼ 10 participating nucle\u0002ons, thus bridging the system size range between proton\u0002nucleus and peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions [22]. In\r
March 2021, RHIC conducted oxygen–oxygen collisions\r
at √\r
sNN = 200 GeV [23]. More recently, in July 2025, the\r
LHC carried out oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon collisions\r
at √sNN = 5.36 TeV, as well as proton–oxygen collisions\r
at √sNN = 9.62 TeV [24, 25]. A pressing open question\r
is whether unambiguous evidence of partonic energy loss\r
can be established in these small collision systems.\r
Selecting central oxygen-oxygen collisions enhances the\r
potential medium-induced energy loss signal. However,\r
such a selection introduces potential biases [26] and, im\u0002portantly, prevents the construction of an accurate the\u0002oretical baseline. Only in minimum-bias collisions can\r
the inclusive high-momentum hadron and jet production\r
be reliably computed using QCD factorization. The stan\u0002dard observable of energy loss is the nuclear modification\r
factor RAA, which is the ratio of pT spectra in nucleus\u0002nucleus and proton-proton collisions scaled by the num\u0002ber of binary collisions [2–4]. In minimum-bias collisions\r
RAA can be written as a ratio of pT -differential cross\r
sections (for some rapidity window |y| < ymax):\r

final-state effects indicative of QGP formation. Since\r
the expected energy-loss signal is small, it is essential\r
to quantify theoretical uncertainties in the baseline of\r
Eq. (1) with high accuracy. To this end, I perform\r
next-to-leading-order (NLO) perturbative QCD calcula\u0002tions using state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution\r
functions (nPDFs) and hadron fragmentation functions\r
(FFs). This work updates the previous baseline esti\u0002mate of Ref. [27] with latests nPDFs, FFs and the actual\r
LHC centre-of-mass energy for oxygen–oxygen collisions.\r
Baseline estimates for charged hadron Rh\r
AA for RHIC en\u0002ergies can be found in Ref. [28]. Baseline computations\r
for inclusive jet R\r
j\r
AA and semi-inclusive jet- and hadron\u0002triggered nuclear modification factors were recently pre\u0002sented in Ref. [29]. Although a statistically significant\r
deviation between the no-quenching baseline and experi\u0002mental data would suffice to establish energy loss in oxy\u0002gen–oxygen collisions, interpreting such a signal requires\r
dedicated model predictions. These have been developed\r
in the literature [30–37] and are not discussed in this pa\u0002per.\r
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, I\r
describe the computational framework and present a val\u0002idation plot. Section III contains the baseline results for\r
the charged-hadron and neutral-pion nuclear modifica\u0002tion factor RAA. For completeness, I also provide the\r
absolute cross-section predictions for proton–proton and\r
oxygen–oxygen collisions separately. The conclusions are\r
summarised in Section IV. Additional results for differ\u0002ent rapidity selections are shown in Section A, while Sec\u0002tion B discusses the role of isospin symmetry in fragmen\u0002tation functions.\r
II. COMPUTATIONAL SETUP\r
A. Inclusive hadron cross-section\r
According to QCD factorisation, the perturbative\r
single-inclusive hadronic cross section is given by the con\u0002volution of parton distribution functions, hard partonic\r
cross section and fragmentation functions [38, 39]\r

Here f\r
A\r
i\r
and f\r
B\r
j\r
are parton distribution functions (PDFs)\r
for nucleus A and B and partons i and j at factoriza\u0002tion scale µF . In this paper, I consider only symmetric\r
collision systems, i.e., A = B = p or A = B = 16\r
8O.\r
σˆ\r
ij→l\r
is the partonic cross-section ij → l, which is com\u0002puted at leading (LO) and next-to-leading (NLO) order\r
at renormalization scale µR. Finally, Dh\r
l\r
is the parton l\r
fragmentation function (FF) into a hadron species h at\r
fragmentation scale µF F . I consider two cases: fragmen\u0002tation to charged hadrons and fragmentation to neutral\r
pions, i.e., h = π\r
0\r
.\r
I evaluated Eq. (2) using INCNLO program [40]2 mod\u0002ified to use LHAPDF grids [41] for parton distribution\r
and fragmentation functions. Modifications were checked\r
against an independent LO implementation of the hadron\r
cross-section formula [27]. INCNLO computes the hadron\r
cross section differentially in transverse momentum pT ,\r
but averaged in the azimuth and rapidity |y| < ymax,\r
i.e., dσh/(2πpT dpT dy). The factorisation, renormalisa\u0002tion, and fragmentation scales are chosen to be equal to\r
hadron transverse momentum µF = µR = µF F = p\r
h\r
T\r
.\r
To estimate uncertainties from missing higher order\r
terms, I vary µF , µR and µF F by a factor 2 up and\r
down with a condition that no two scales are varied up\r
and down at the same time (15-point scale uncertainty\r
prescription). Although scale uncertainties do not have\r
probabilistic interpretation [42], the nested LO and NLO\r
scale uncertainties are conventionally used to assess the\r
perturbative convergence of the observable.\r
To estimate uncertainties from (nuclear) parton dis\u0002tribution functions, I use three sets of proton and oxy\u0002gen PDFs: EPPS21 [43], which uses CT18ANLO [44]\r
as a proton PDF baseline, nNNPDF3.0 [45], which\r
is matched to NNPDF3.1 [46] proton PDF, and\r
TUJU21 [47], which simultaneously determines nucleus\r
and proton PDFs. All three nPDF determinations\r
include experimental data from measurements in pPb\r
collisions at the LHC: W± and Z boson production\r
(TUJU21, EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); dijet and D-meson\r
data (EPPS21, nNNPDF3.0); isolated photon measure\u0002ments (nNNPDF3.0). Each nPDF extraction is accom\u0002panied by a large set of PDF variations, which can be\r
used to determine the confidence intervals for the com\u0002puted cross section. For each PDF in an error set, I re\u0002peat the cross-section computation and use the built-in\r
LHAPDF functionality to compute 68% confidence inter\u0002vals. Note that no data with oxygen nucleus is included\r
in the fits, and oxygen nPDFs are determined by interpo\u0002lation in nuclear mass number A. Comparison between\r
different collaborations shows how robust this extraction\r
is with respect to changes in the input data, fitting tech\u0002niques, and nPDF parametrisation.\r
To estimate uncertainties from the choice of fragmen\u0002tation functions, I used three choices of fragmentation\r
functions: Binnewies-Kniehl-Kramer (BKK) [48] FFs,\r
which is a built-in option in INCNLO, NNFF1.1h[49]3 and\r
NPC23 [50] FFs. BKK fits charged pion and kaon FFs\r
to √\r
s = 29 GeV e\r
+e− annihilation data. The charged\r
hadron FFs are formed as a sum of charged pion and\r
kaon FFs. Pion contribution is increased by a factor 1.16\r
to mimic (anti)proton contribution. NNFF1.1h charged\r
hadron FFs are obtained from a direct fit to charged\r

nihilation (SIA) and pp collisions. Notably, NNFF1.1h\r
includes LHC charged hadron data at centre of mass en\u0002ergies √\r
s = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV. NPC23 performs global\r
analysis of a wide range of precision measurements from\r
the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions\r
and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. NPC23 in\u0002cludes both identified hadron (π\r
±, K±, p(¯p)) and charged\r
hadron data at LHC up to √\r
s = 13 TeV. Charged\r
hadron FFs are a sum of fitted charged pion, kaon, and\r
(anti)proton FFs. We also use neutral pion FFs con\u0002structed from NPC23 charged pion FFs using isospin\r
symmetry [51]4. NNFF1.1h and NPC23 provide FF error\r
sets, which are used to compute 68% confidence intervals.\r
BKK FFs do not include uncertainty estimates, and only\r
scale uncertainties are shown.\r
In the ratio of cross sections Eq. (1), one can expect a\r
significant cancellation between common sources of theo\u0002retical uncertainties in proton and oxygen cross sections.\r
Therefore, the scale uncertainty of RAA is determined\r
by the simultaneous variation of µF , µR and µF F in the\r
numerator and denominator. Cross sections for different\r
members of the oxygen nPDF error set are also matched\r
to the corresponding error set members in the proton\r
baseline, maximising the uncertainty cancellation. For\r
NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs, uncertainties in RAA are\r
computed by taking the cross-section ratio for each mem\u0002ber in the error set and then applying the corresponding\r
uncertainty prescription.\r

good agreement with experimental data, which is not sur\u0002prising, since these FFs are fitted to LHC proton-proton\r

In Fig. 2, I present the no-quenching baseline results\r
for the charged-hadron nuclear modification factor Rh\r
AA\r
in oxygen–oxygen collisions at √s = 5.36 TeV, within the\r
kinematic range |y| < 0.8 and 4 GeV < pT < 200 GeV.\r
Additional results for other rapidity intervals are pro\u0002vided in Section A.\r
The brown and red shaded bands indicate the LO and\r
NLO scale uncertainties, computed with EPPS21 nPDFs\r
and BKK FFs. At pT ≳ 20 GeV, these uncertainties can\u0002cel efficiently in the ratio, and the NLO band becomes\r
comparable to the line thickness. At lower pT , scale un\u0002certainties grow more noticeable, yet the NLO band re\u0002mains fully nested within the LO band, reflecting good\r
perturbative convergence.\r
The hatched red, blue, and orange bands correspond\r
to the 68% confidence intervals of EPPS21, TUJU21,\r
and nNNPDF3.0 nPDFs (all with BKK FFs). For\r
pT ≳ 20 GeV, the three nPDFs are consistent, with\r
overlapping uncertainty bands. In the range 20 GeV ≲\r
pT ≲ 100 GeV, EPPS21 gives the widest uncertainty\r
band (∼ 5%), while for pT ≳ 100 GeV, nNNPDF3.0 be\u0002comes slightly broader. TUJU21 shows the narrowest\r
uncertainties, though this reflects its limited dataset and\r

At lower momenta (pT ≲ 20 GeV), nPDF uncertainties\r
increase, and differences between the extractions become\r
more pronounced. TUJU21 and nNNPDF3.0 remain cen\u0002tred near unity, whereas the EPPS21 band drops below\r
unity for pT ≲ 10 GeV. Thus, experimental observations\r
of Rh\r
AA < 1 in this region would not unambiguously sig\u0002nal medium-induced energy loss.\r
Next, I examine the sensitivity to fragmentation func\u0002tions (FFs). The cyan and olive bands show the 68%\r
confidence intervals for NNFF1.1h and NPC23 charged\u0002hadron FFs. For both uncertainty cancellation is ex\u0002cellent with bands barely wider than the line thickness\r
across the full pT range. Results with NPC23 closely\r
match those with BKK FFs, whereas NNFF1.1h exhibits\r
striking deviations: at pT ≳ 70 GeV, Rh\r
AA falls well be\u0002low unity. As discussed in Section B, this originates\r
from strong isospin breaking in NNFF1.1h, where down\u0002quark fragmentation is significantly suppressed. Since\r
oxygen nuclei contain a larger fraction of down quarks,\r
the hadron yield is reduced at high pT , where quark frag\u0002mentation dominates [30]. Such strong isospin break\u0002ing is unexpected, given that charged hadrons are domi\u0002nated by pions. Nevertheless, in the intermediate region\r
(20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV), differences between FF sets\r
remain below 5%.\r
The black dashed line in Fig. 2 shows the central pre\u0002diction for the neutral-pion RAA obtained with NPC23\r
FFs. It closely follows the charged-hadron Rh\r
AA with the\r
same FF set, as expected, since charged-hadron produc\u0002tion is pion-dominated and the neutral-pion FFs are con\u0002structed from charged-pion FFs.\r

that the nuclear mass number dependence is poorly con\u0002strained in current nPDFs, leading to strongly correlated\r

For pp, the PDF uncertainties are below 4% (not shown\r
in Fig. 1). The results with CT18ANLO and nNNPDF3.0\r
are in good agreement, while TUJU21 exhibits a differ\u0002ent trend, crossing the other two around p\r
h\r
T ∼ 50 GeV.\r
For OO collisions, EPPS21 nPDF uncertainties are sub\u0002stantially larger, exceeding 5%, and are mostly consistent\r
with nNNPDF3.0 results, while TUJU21 again shows a\r
distinct momentum dependence.\r
Finally, sizeable discrepancies arise between BKK,\r
NNFF1.0h, and NPC23 FFs, which are not covered by\r
the uncertainty bands of NNFF1.0h and NPC23. Pre\u0002dictions with NNFF1.0h lie about 25% below those with\r
BKK, while the NPC23-to-BKK ratio exhibits a pro\u0002nounced momentum dependence. Nevertheless, all FF\r
sets remain mutually consistent once the NLO scale un\u0002certainty is taken into account.\r
IV. CONCLUSIONS\r
In July 2025 the LHC collided oxygen ions for the first\r
time, providing a unique opportunity to search for an un\u0002ambiguous signal of jet quenching in a system with, on\r
average, only about ten participating nucleons. Because\r
the expected signal is small, it is essential to quantify\r
precisely the difference in the initial perturbative produc\u0002tion of high-momentum partons between oxygen–oxygen\r
and proton–proton collisions. To this end, I have car\u0002ried out a systematic study of the no-quenching baseline\r
for the single-inclusive hadron nuclear modification fac-

6\r
tor, Rh\r
AA, in minimum-bias oxygen–oxygen collisions at\r
√\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV. Using state-of-the-art nuclear parton\r
distribution functions (nPDFs) and fragmentation func\u0002tions (FFs), I have provided a robust estimate of the\r
theoretical uncertainties associated with this baseline.\r
In the momentum window 20 GeV ≲ pT ≲ 70 GeV, the\r
baseline can be controlled at the ∼ 5% level, with nPDFs\r
representing the dominant source of uncertainty. At\r
lower and higher pT , however, the combined nPDF and\r
FF uncertainties become sizeable, potentially limiting the\r
ability to disentangle medium effects from the baseline.\r
The difference between neutral-pion and charged-hadron\r
Rh\r
AA is negligible compared with the nPDF uncertainties,\r
indicating that both observables are equally suitable for\r
probing medium-induced energy loss.\r
The largest systematic uncertainty in charged-hadron\r
Rh\r
AA, particularly at low pT , stems from the limited\r
knowledge of oxygen nPDFs. The large pO dataset re\u0002cently collected at the LHC will be crucial for constrain\u0002ing oxygen nPDFs in future global fits [56]. At high\r
pT , I find non-negligible discrepancies between different\r
FF extractions, which appear to originate from isospin\u0002symmetry breaking in some sets. These discrepancies will\r
hopefully be resolved in future global FF analyses, poten\u0002tially aided by input from hadron spectra in pA collisions.\r
In parallel, theoretical advances in charged hadron com\u0002putations—NNLO accuracy in hadronic collisions [57]\r
and N3LO in electron–positron annihilation [58]—are\r
paving the way towards substantially more precise FF\r
determinations.\r
In conclusion, the charged-hadron nuclear modification\r
factor in oxygen–oxygen collisions can be predicted to\r
within ∼ 5% in the most favourable kinematic range.\r
Whether this precision is sufficient to observe a jet\u0002quenching signal in such a small system will also depend\r
on experimental uncertainties and the potential signal\r
size [30–37]. In particular, a new source of experimental\r
uncertainty arises in oxygen beams due to transmuta\u0002tion into other ion species [59]. Finally, the collected\r
oxygen–oxygen and neon–neon data at the same energy\r
provide an additional handle: the ratio of hadron spectra\r
between NeNe and OO collisions would largely cancel the\r
nPDF uncertainties in the perturbative baseline, while\r
still allowing for a potential medium-induced signal [36].\r

For NPC23, the up- and down-quark FFs are very sim\u0002ilar (Fig. 6). This reflects the fact that NPC23 charged\u0002hadron FFs are dominated by pions, which exhibit a high\r
degree of isospin symmetry [50]. In contrast, NNFF1.1h\r
shows a much smaller down-quark FF compared with\r
the up-quark FF. The flavour separation of quark FFs\r
is poorly constrained by data and typically requires ad\u0002ditional assumptions. In NNFF1.1h [49], flavour sepa\u0002ration was introduced following the procedure for kaons\r
described in Appendix A of Ref. [62]. Since charged kaons\r
are not symmetric under d ↔ u exchange, this approach\r
naturally leads to FFs that violate isospin symmetry.\r
In Fig. 7, I demonstrate that this up–down differ\u0002ence drives the discrepancy observed in Fig. 2. To this\r
end, I performed LO cross-section calculations with mod\u0002ified FFs. The solid lines show Rh\r
AA with the origi\u0002nal NNFF1.1h and NPC23 FFs combined with EPPS21\r
nPDFs. The dotted lines correspond to computations\r
where the down-quark FF is set equal to the up-quark\r
FF (enforcing strict isospin symmetry). In this case, the\r
NPC23 results remain essentially unchanged and consis\u0002tent with the observed isospin symmetry in Fig. 6. In\r
contrast, the NNFF1.1h results become nearly identi\u0002cal to those of NPC23. Conversely, setting the down\u0002quark FF to zero (maximal isospin asymmetry) leaves\r
NNFF1.1h largely unaffected, while NPC23 develops\r
the anomalous suppression of Rh\r
AA at high momentum.\r
These modifications only affect the high-pT region, since\r
at pT < 50 GeV hadron production is dominated by gluon\r
fragmentation [30].\r
