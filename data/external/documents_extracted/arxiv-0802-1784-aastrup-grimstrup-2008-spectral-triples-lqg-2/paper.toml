Abstract\r
A semifinite spectral triple for an algebra canonically associated to\r
canonical quantum gravity is constructed. The algebra is generated by\r
based loops in a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions. The\r
underlying space can be seen as a gauge fixing of the unconstrained\r
state space of Loop Quantum Gravity. This paper is the second of\r
two papers on the subject.\r

1 Introduction\r
One of the most striking application of Noncommutative Geometry [9] is\r
Connes’ derivation of the Standard Model of high energy physics [10, 8]. In\r
this derivation the Lagrangian of the full Standard Model coupled to gravity\r
emerges from the spectral action principle [7] applied to a specific almost\r
commutative geometry.\r
2

This formulation is, however, essentially classical and does, at a funda\u0002mental level, not involve quantization. This raises the question how the\r
quantization procedure of Quantum Field Theory fits into the framework\r
on Noncommutative Geometry. Since Connes’ formulation of the Standard\r
Model at its root is tied up to gravitation, a quantization scheme within the\r
framework of Noncommutative Geometry must be expected to involve, at\r
some level, quantum gravity.\r
In the papers [2] and [3] we started studying the question of formulating\r
a quantization scheme within Noncommutative Geometry using canonical\r
quantum gravity. Specifically, we were inspired by techniques applied in\r
Loop Quantum Gravity. The concrete aim was to construct a spectral triple\r
of a noncommutative algebra naturally associated to the unconstrained state\r
space of Loop Quantum Gravity. Due to technical difficulties we only suc\u0002ceeded in constructing a spectral triple on a space closely related to the state\r
space of Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
This paper is one of two papers presenting a more satisfactory solution\r
to the problem of constructing a spectral triple on the state space of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity as well as its physical interpretations. The paper [1] deals\r
with the physical background and interpretations of the construction, and we\r
therefore refer the reader to that paper for more thorough discussion. This\r
paper deals with the concise mathematical construction.\r
1.1 Content of the paper\r
The unconstrained state space of Loop Quantum Gravity is the space of\r
SU(2)-connections in a trivial principal bundle on a three dimensional mani\u0002fold. Since the construction we do works for arbitrary manifolds and arbitrary\r
compact Lie-groups, and since we for physical applications might need it for\r
later use, we will formulate it in this generality.\r
We let G be a compact Lie group and assume we have some principal\r
G-fiber bundle P over a manifold M. The algebra associated to the space A\r
of connections in P we want to consider is the following:\r
Given a representation of G in MN and given a loop L in M define a\r
matrix valued function on A by\r
L(∇) = Hol(∇, L),\r
where Hol(∇, L) denotes the holonomy of ∇ along L. Let B be the algebra\r
3

generated by all loops based in a fixed point in M. This is the type of algebra\r
we want to consider.\r
The algebra B is an algebra of matrix valued functions over A. We will for\r
technical reasons explained below consider a smaller algebra than B. We will\r
take a triangulation of M and consider the algebra B△ which is constructed\r
like B but only includes loops lying in the edges of the triangulations, or\r
one of its barycentric subdivisions. B△ is also an algebra of matrix valued\r
functions over A. Since any loop can be approximated by a loop lying in the\r
edges of the triangulations, or one of its barycentric subdivisions, B△ can\r
be considered as an approximation to B. The crucial difference is that the\r
groups of all diffeomorphisms preserving the base point acts on B whereas\r
only the group differomorphisms preserving the chosen triangulation and its\r
barycentric subdivisions acts on B△.\r
In order to construct a spectral triple over B△ we need a representation of\r
B△. We therefore need to construct L\r
2\r
(A). A construction of L\r
2\r
(A) already\r
exists within Loop Quantum Gravity, due to Ashtekar and Lewandowski. It\r
turns out that this construction depends on a completion of A and that this\r
completion depends on a choice of a system S of graphs. In the case of B△\r
the relevant system of graphs is given by finite subgraphs of the triangulation\r
and its barycentric subdivision. The system of graphs considered in Loop\r
Quantum Gravity is that of graphs made up of piecewise real analytic edges\r
(of course assuming M to be real analytic).\r
Seen from a graph Γ with edges {ei}i=1,...,n the space of connections A\r
looks like Gn via\r
A ∋ ∇ → (Hol(∇, e1), . . . , Hol(∇, en)).\r
We will also denote AΓ := Gn. Of course AΓ tells little about A. However,\r
by letting the complexity of the graph grow we get a more and more refined\r
picture of A. This is implemented by noting that an embedding Γ1 ⊂ Γ2\r
naturally gives a map\r
PΓ1Γ2\r
: AΓ2 → AΓ1\r
,\r
and then simply define the completion of A as the projective limit of AΓ, i.e.\r
A\r
S\r
:= limΓ∈S ←−\r
AΓ,\r
We will prove that under some condition on S that A is densely embedded\r
in A\r
S\r
, and hence justifies the term completion.\r
4

The construction of L\r
2\r
(A) is straightforward from this completion. Since\r
AΓ = Gn we define L\r
2\r
(AΓ) as square integrable functions on Gn with respect\r
to the Haar measure. The map PΓ1Γ2induces an embedding\r
PΓ1Γ2: L\r
2\r
(AΓ1) → L\r
2\r
(AΓ2),\r
and L\r
2\r
(A) is defined as an inductive limit\r
L\r
2\r
(A) := limΓ∈S −→\r
L\r
2\r
(AΓ).\r
The idea for constructing the Dirac operator is that AΓ = Gnis a classical\r
geometry and therefore has a canonical Gauß-Bonnet-Dirac operator. In\r
order to ensure that this defines an operator on the inductive limit we have\r
to make sure that the operator is compatible with the structure maps of\r
the projective limit. It is here the technical advantages of the triangulation\r
compared to piecewise real analytic graphs shows up. The triangulation\r
narrows down the types of structure maps appearing in the projective limit.\r
With this we can define a Dirac operator compatible with the structure maps.\r
It turns out that there is a lot freedom in the construction. Going from one\r
level in the inductive limit to the next level we add new copies of G which\r
corresponds to new degrees of freedom. Each of these degrees of freedom can\r
be scaled. The entire construction therefore comes with a sequence of real\r
non zero numbers {a\r
j,k}k≤j\r
, where j, k is just a labelling of the degrees of\r
freedoms convenient for the explicit construction.\r
However, the constructed Dirac operator together with the algebra B△\r
will not fulfil the requirement of a spectral triple. The problem comes from\r
the infinite dimensionality of the Clifford bundle of the space of connection.\r
We therefore need to treat the identity operator on the Clifford bundle as\r
a finite rank operator. The setting of semifinite spectral triples will allow\r
exactly this. The von Neumann algebra N appearing from this construction\r
is a tensor product of the bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space\r
and the weak closure of the CAR-algebra.\r
In order to obtain a semifinite spectral triple we still need to perturb the\r
operator. At each level in the inductive limit we have to add a bounded\r
perturbation roughly speaking of the form bjPj, where bjis a real number\r
and Pjis the projection onto a subspace related to the kernel of a part of\r
the Dirac operator at the j’th level.\r
The main result in the paper is 4.5.1 stating\r
Theorem There exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and {bj} such that B△ together with\r
5

the perturbated Dirac operator is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to\r
the trace on N .\r
In the appendix we will demonstrate the case of U(1) and show that for\r
SU(2) the perturbations are not needed.\r

2 Spaces of connections\r
In this section we will consider the space A of connections in a principal fiber\r
bundle. We will address the problem of topologizing this space together with\r
the development of a measure theory. It turns out that the constructions,\r
which we introduce in order to address these problems, depends on a com\u0002pletion of A with respect to a system of graphs on the manifold. Different\r
choices of graphs give different completions.\r
The material is standard from Loop Quantum Gravity, but we have cho\u0002sen to write a more or less selfcontained exposition, not assuming prior knowl\u0002edge of Loop Quantum Gravity, since we want to put emphasize on several\r
different completions and their mutual interplay. The original techniques\r
were developed by Ashtekar and Lewandowski in [4]. For a survey of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity see [5] and for a detailed account see [14].\r
Let M be a manifold and P a G-principal bundle over M, where G is a\r
compact connected Lie-group. We will for simplicity assume that P is the\r
6

trivial bundle, i.e. P is isomorphic to M × G.\r
2.1 Graphs\r
Definition 2.1.1 Let γ be a continuous piecewise smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M\r
such that if γ(t1) = γ(t2) then t1 = t2 or t1, t2 ∈ {0, 1}. We call γ a simple\r
curve if γ˙(t) is non vanishing for all t ∈ [0, 1]. This requirement includes that\r
the left and right derivative of γ is non vanishing in the non smooth points.\r
We will call γ(0) the starting point and γ(1) the endpoint.\r
If γ1 and γ2 are simple curves where the endpoint of γ1 coincides with the\r
starting point of γ2, then the composition is defined by\r
(γ1 ◦ γ2)(t) = \u001A\r
γ1(2t) t ∈ [0,\r
1\r
2\r
]\r
γ2(2t − 1) t ∈ [\r
1\r
2\r
, 1] .\r
Note that the composition of two simple curves is not always a simple curve.\r
Definition 2.1.2 Two simple curves γ1 and γ2 are equivalent if there exist\r
an increasing piecewise smooth bijection\r
φ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]\r
with\r
γ1(φ(t)) = γ2(t), t ∈ [0, 1],\r
and with nowhere vanishing derivative. This requirement includes that the\r
left and right derivatives in the non smooth points are both non vanishing.\r
An equivalence class of simple curves is called a simple path.\r
Note that the relation defined above is in fact an equivalence relation.\r
The notion of a simple path chosen here implies that a simple path has\r
an orientation. The inverse of a simple path represented by γ is the path\r
represented by γ\r
−1\r
, where\r
γ\r
−1\r
(t) = γ(1 − t),\r
i.e. just the path with inverse orientation.\r
7

Definition 2.1.3 A graph Γ is the union of finite many simple paths {ei}\r
where the only intersection points are start or end points of the simple paths.\r
The paths are called the edges of the graph. We denote the set of edges\r
of Γ by EΓ. The points {ei(0), ej (1)} are called the vertices of Γ. We denote\r
the set of vertices by VΓ.\r
A graph is called connected if ∪i,tei(t) is connected.\r
We will consider paths on the graph. These are simply compositions of\r
edges and inverses of edges. We will also think of each vertex as a path in\r
the graph. Furthermore, we would like ei ◦ (ei)\r
−1\r
to be equal to the path\r
ei(0). We fix this with the following\r
Definition 2.1.4 Let Γ be a graph and let P(Γ) be the set of paths in Γ. We\r
define an equivalence relation ∼ on P(Γ) to be generated by\r
(ei)\r
−1\r
◦ ei ∼ ei(1) and ei ◦ (ei)\r
−1 ∼ ei(0).\r
The hoop groupoid HG(Γ) of path on Γ is defined by\r
HG(Γ) = P(Γ)/ ∼ .\r
This equivalence relation implies that if p1, p2, p3 ∈ P(Γ) and p1 ∼ p2\r
then p3 ◦ p1 ∼ p3 ◦ p2 and p1 ◦ p3 ∼ p2 ◦ p3 whenever the compositions are\r
defined. The units for HG(Γ) are the vertices of Γ. It is easy to see that\r
HG(Γ) is a groupoid.\r
Definition 2.1.5 Let Γ1, Γ2 be two graphs. We say that Γ1 is a subgraph of\r
Γ2, and we write Γ1 ⊂ Γ2, if the edges of Γ1 are compositions of the edges or\r
their inverses of Γ2.\r
Note that Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 implies that HG(Γ1) is a subgruopoid of HG(Γ2).\r
The relation ⊂ equips the set of graphs with a partial order. We are\r
interested in subsystems of the set of all graphs.\r
Definition 2.1.6 A system S of graphs is called directed if there for any\r
Γ1, Γ2 ∈ S exists Γ3 ∈ S with Γ1, Γ2 ⊂ Γ3.\r
Definition 2.1.7 A system of graphs S is called dense if there for every\r
point m ∈ M exists a coordinate chart x = (x1, . . . , xn) around m such that\r
for all open subset U containing m in this coordinate chart there exists a\r
collection of edges e1, . . . , en ⊂ U belonging to graphs in S such that:\r
8

1. the ei\r
’s are straight lines with respect to the coordinate chart,\r
2. the tangent vectors of the ei’s are linearly independent.\r
The definition of dense might appear awkward. The main purpose of the\r
definition is to ensure proposition 2.2.4. Furthermore it is easy to check the\r
definition in the concrete examples we have in mind. Certainly the require\u0002ment of straight lines can be eased.\r
We will now give three examples of dense systems of graphs, which will\r
be important in the rest of the paper. These systems of graphs differ partic\u0002ularly in the size of their corresponding symmetry groups.\r
Example 1 Let Ss be the system of all graphs. This system is clearly\r
dense. The system is however not directed since we can have two simple paths\r
e1, e2 with infinitely many isolated intersection points. Hence for graphs\r
Γ1, Γ2, where e1 ∈ Γ1 and e2 ∈ Γ2, there does not exist a graphs Γ3 contain\u0002ing Γ1 and Γ2. The system Ss admits a natural action of the diffeomorphism\r
group Diff(M). The system Ss is the same as the piecewise immersed sys\u0002tem defined in [11].\r
Example 2 Let M be a real analytic manifold. Let Sa be the system of\r
graph made up of real analytic simple curves. This system is dense and it\r
is also directed since piecewise analytic curves have only finitely many iso\u0002lated intersection points. The system carries a natural action of the group\r
Diffa(M) of real analytic diffeomorphism, but no action of the full diffeo\u0002morphism group Diff(M). This system was, in a base pointed version, first\r
considered in [4].\r
Example 3 Let T be a triangulation of M. We let Γ0 be the graph\r
consisting of all the edges in this triangulation. Strictly speaking this is not\r
a graph if the manifold in not compact, but in this case we can consider\r
Γ0 as a system of graphs instead. Let Tn be the triangulation obtained by\r
barycentric subdividing each of the simplices in T n times. The graph Γn is\r
the graph consisting of the edges of Tn. In this way we get a directed and\r
dense system S△ = {Γn} of graphs.\r
The important feature of S△ which we are going to use in this paper is\r
the following: The step from Γn to Γn+1 involves:\r
9

M\r
Γ1\r
M\r
Γ2\r
...\r
Figure 1:\r
1. new edges are added\r
2. the edges of Γn get subdivided into two edges.\r
The system S△ only admits an action of the diffeomorphisms Diff(△)\r
that maps edges in ∪Tn to edges in ∪Tn. Hence this is a much more restrictive\r
class of diffeomorphism than in the first two examples. Contrary to the first\r
two examples, the system S△ is countable.\r
Definition 2.1.8 Let S be a directed system of graphs. We define the hoop\r
groupoid HG(S) of S to be the inductive limit\r
HG(S) = limΓ∈S −→\r
HG(Γ).\r
2.2 Completing spaces of connections\r
Given a graph Γ define the space\r
AΓ = Hom(HG(Γ), G)\r
where G is the compact connected Lie-group. If Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 we have the em\u0002bedding of groupoids HG(Γ1) → HG(Γ2), and we hence get a surjection\r
PΓ1Γ2\r
: AΓ2 → AΓ1\r
.\r
Therefore, for a system of graphs S we have a projective system\r
{AΓ}Γ∈S.\r
10

Definition 2.2.1 Let S be a system of graphs. The space of generalized\r
connections with respect to S, denoted by A\r
S\r
, is defined by\r
A\r
S\r
= limΓ∈S ←−\r
AΓ.\r
The projections from A\r
S\r
to AΓ will be denoted by PΓ.\r
For the systems Ss, Sa, S△ we will denote the corresponding spaces of gener\u0002alized connections by A\r
s\r
, A\r
a\r
, A\r
△\r
.\r
Note that when S is directed we have the equality\r
A\r
S\r
= Hom(HG(S), G).\r
Given an element ∇ in AΓ we can associate to it ΦΓ(∇) ∈ GnΓ where nΓ\r
is the numbers of edges in Γ. This is done by numbering the edges in Γ as\r
e1, . . . , enΓ, and then defining ΦΓ by\r
ΦΓ(∇) = (∇(e1), . . . , ∇(enΓ\r
)).\r
Lemma 2.2.2 The map ΦΓ : AΓ → GnΓ is a bijection.\r
Proof. Follows since HG(Γ) is freely generated by the edges. ⊳\r
The bijection ΦΓ gives a topology on AΓ by requiring ΦΓ to be a home\u0002omorphism. The topology is independent of the chosen numbering. The\r
projection maps PΓ1Γ2: AΓ2 → AΓ1 are continuous. In fact\r
ΦΓ1 ◦ PΓ1Γ2 ◦ (ΦΓ2)\r
−1\r
: G\r
nΓ2 → GnΓ1\r
is given by composition of one or more of the following operations:\r
• Multiplying gi1 and gi2.\r
• Inverting gi.\r
• Leaving out some giin (g1, . . . , gnΓ2\r
) ∈ GnΓ2 .\r
Since A\r
S\r
is a projective limit of {AΓ}Γ∈S, we define the topology on A\r
S\r
as\r
the projective limit topology. This topology is characterized by the following\r
property:\r
Let X be a topological space and assume we have continuous maps φΓ :\r
X → AΓ for all Γ ∈ S such that PΓ1Γ2 ◦ φΓ2 = φΓ1for all Γ1 ⊂ Γ2. Then\r
there is a unique continuous map φ : X → A\r
S\r
with PΓ ◦φΓ = φ for all Γ ∈ S.\r
11

2.2.1 Smooth connections\r
Let A denote the space of smooth connections in the principal bundle P.\r
There is a natural map\r
χΓ : A → AΓ = Hom(HG(Γ), G)\r
defined by\r
χΓ(∇)(p) = Hol(p, ∇), p ∈ HG(Γ),\r
where Hol(p, ∇) denotes the holonomy of ∇ along p. Clearly PΓ1Γ2 ◦χΓ2 = χΓ1\r
when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2, and hence by the property of the projective limit we get a\r
unique map\r
χS : A → A\r
S\r
.\r
Proposition 2.2.3 When S is directed, χS(A) is dense in A\r
S\r
.\r
Proof. We first prove that each χΓ is surjective. The composition\r
ΦΓ ◦ χΓ : A → G\r
nΓ\r
is given by\r
ΦΓ(χΓ(∇)) = (Hol(e1, ∇), . . . , Hol(enΓ, ∇)).\r
Let (g1, . . . , gnΓ\r
) be given. Since G is connected we can for each i find a\r
connection ∇i with\r
Hol(ei, ∇i) = gi.\r
It is furthermore easy to see that since the ei’s only intersect in the endpoints\r
we can arrange that ∇i = 0 on all the edges in Γ apart from ei. Hence\r
ΦΓ\r
\u0010\r
χΓ\r
\u0010X∇i\u0011\u0011 = (g1, . . . , gnΓ\r
).\r
Therefore χΓ is surjective.\r
From the directedness of S and the surjectivity of all χΓ the density fol\u0002lows. ⊳\r
The system Ss is not directed. It is however possible with more elaborate\r
methods to prove that A is dense in A\r
Ss\r
when G is semi-simple, see for\r
example the discussion in [12].\r
We now turn to the question of injectivity of χ.\r
12

Proposition 2.2.4 When S is dense, χS is injective.\r
Proof. Let ∇1, ∇2 be two different smooth connections. Hence there\r
is a point m ∈ M where ∇1(m) 6= ∇2(m). Let us choose a coordinate\r
chart x = (x1, . . . , xn) around m according to the density of S, where m\r
corresponds to x = 0. We can then write\r
∇k =\r
X\r
j\r
g\r
k\r
j\r
(x)dxj, k ∈ {1, 2},\r
where g\r
i\r
j\r
(x) is a smooth function of x with values in the Lie-algebra of G. Let\r
U be a neighbourhood of 0 such that we can assume that the functions g\r
i\r
j\r
(x)\r
are constant in U with sufficiently good approximation. Let e1, . . . , en be\r
the edges in S which are straight lines with respect to the coordinate chart,\r
which belongs to U and where the tangent vectors t\r
1\r
, . . . , t\r
n are linearly\r
independent. We assume that the edges are parametrized by arc lengths.\r
Since ∇1(m) 6= ∇2(m) there is a j such that\r
X\r
i\r
g\r
1\r
i\r
(0)t\r
j\r
i\r
6=\r
X\r
i\r
g\r
2\r
i\r
(0)t\r
j\r
i\r
.\r
With sufficiently good approximation we have\r
Hol(ej, ∇k) = exp(X\r
i\r
g\r
1\r
i\r
(0)t\r
j\r
i\r
), k ∈ {1, 2}.\r
Hence, if we had chosen U small enough, we conclude\r
Hol(ej, ∇1) 6= Hol(ej, ∇2).\r
Thus χS(∇1) 6= χS(∇2). ⊳\r
2.2.2 Completing the group of gauge transformations\r
Let U be a an element in the gauge group G of M × P, i.e. U : M → G is a\r
smooth function. Given a connection ∇ ∈ A, U induces a gauge transformed\r
connection ∇˜ . Given a path p on M with startpoint x0 and endpoint x1 the\r
holonomy along e transforms according to\r
Hol(p, ∇˜ ) = U(x0)Hol(p, ∇)U\r
−1\r
(x1).\r
This leads to the following\r
13

Definition 2.2.5 Let Γ be a graphs and U : VΓ → G be a map. Define\r
U∗ : AΓ → AΓ by\r
U∗(∇)(e) = U(e(0))∇(e)U(e(1))−1for all e ∈ EΓ.\r
Since HG(Γ) is freely generated by EΓ, this is well defined.\r
We denote by GΓ the group of all maps U : VΓ → G.\r
Note that via U∗ we get a left action of GΓ on AΓ.\r
Like with spaces of connections there are natural projections\r
PΓ1Γ2: GΓ2 → GΓ1,\r
when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 and\r
PΓ1Γ2(U∗(∇)) = PΓ1Γ2\r
(U)∗(PΓ1Γ2\r
(∇)), ∇ ∈ AΓ2, U ∈ GΓ2. (1)\r
Definition 2.2.6 Let S be a system of graphs. Put\r
G\r
S\r
= {U|U : ∪Γ∈SVΓ → G}.\r
Define the left action of G\r
S\r
on A\r
S\r
by\r
U · ∇ = (U|VΓ)∗(∇), ∇ ∈ AΓ.\r
Due to (1) this is well defined.\r
A gauge transformation U ∈ G naturally gives an element in G\r
S\r
. When\r
S is dense this induces an embedding G → G\r
S\r
. Via this embedding we get\r
an action of G on A\r
S\r
, which extends the action of G on A. We will therefore\r
call G\r
S\r
the completed gauge group, or simply the gauge group.\r
2.3 Group actions on the completions\r
If a system S1 is contained in S2 we get a surjective continuous map\r
PS1S2: A\r
S2 → AS1\r
.\r
In particular we have the commutative diagram\r
A\r
s\r
PS△Ss\r
5\r
PSaSs /A\r
a\r
PS△Sa\r
/A\r
△\r
14

Of course the map PS△Sa only exists if the triangulation is real analytic.\r
The group of all diffeomorphisms Diff(M) acts on A. The question is\r
what kind of groups acts on the different completions A\r
S\r
. In general a dif\u0002feomorphism d preserving S induces a homeomorphism d\r
∗\r
: A\r
S\r
→ A\r
S\r
. Thus\r
in this way there is an action of Diff(S), the diffeomorphisms preserving S,\r
on A\r
S\r
. We have the following diagram\r
A\r
s\r
PSaSs\r

We see that the size of the completion of A is strongly related to the size of\r
the symmetry group. The spaces A\r
s\r
, A\r
a\r
are non separable and the symmetry\r
groups are large, whereas A\r
△\r
is separable and the symmetry group Diff(△)\r
is comparatively small. In this way we can think of A\r
△\r
as being A\r
s\r
(or A\r
a\r
)\r
subjected to a kind of gauge fixing of Diff(M) (or Diffa(M)).\r
2.4 Measure theory and Hilbert spaces\r
We will here recall the construction of measures and Hilbert space structures\r
on completions of spaces of connections. The construction first appeared in\r
[4]. See also [13] for a different approach.\r
Because of lemma 2.2.2 we can identify AΓ with GnΓ via ΦΓ. On GnΓ\r
there is a canonical normalized measure, namely the Haar measure µGnΓ .\r
Denote by µΓ the image measure of µGnΓ under Φ−1\r
Γ\r
.\r
Lemma 2.4.1 Let Γ1 ⊂ Γ2. The image measure of µΓ2 under PΓ2Γ1is µΓ1.\r
Proof. See for example lemma I.2.9 in [14]. ⊳\r
Lemma 2.4.1 ensures that {AΓ, µΓ}γ∈S is a projective system of measure\r
spaces. Therefore, according to Theorem I.2.10 in [14], there is a unique\r
measure µ on A\r
S\r
such that PΓ(µ) = µΓ for all Γ ∈ S. Also lemma 2.4.1\r
ensures that\r
P\r
∗\r
Γ2Γ1\r
: L\r
2\r
(AΓ1) → L\r
2\r
(AΓ2)\r
15

is an embedding of Hilbert spaces when Γ1 ⊂ Γ2.\r
Proposition 2.4.2 Let\r
L\r
2\r
(A) = lim−→L\r
2\r
(AΓ),\r
the inductive limit of the Hilbert spaces {L\r
2\r
(AΓ)}Γ∈S. Then L\r
2\r
(A) = L\r
2\r
(A\r
S\r
),\r
where the latter is with respect to the measure µ.\r
Proof. This follows directly from the construction. See for example sec\u0002tion I.2.4 in [14]. ⊳\r
3 The Dirac operator on the completed space\r
of connections\r
In this section we will only work with the completed space A\r
△\r
. We will\r
construct a Dirac type operator acting on a Hilbert space H which can natu\u0002rally be seen as square integrable functions on A\r
△\r
with values in an infinite\r
dimensional vector bundle.\r
The idea is to construct a Dirac operator on each AΓ. Since these look like\r
classical geometries we more or less only have to put a Riemannian metric\r
on each of these. Next we need to check that the construction made on each\r
AΓ is consistent with maps between the different graphs.\r
In this section we have no restrictions on the manifold M. In particular\r
we can have infinitely many simplices in T0.\r
To simplify the notation objects indexed by the graph Γk will be indexed\r
simply by k for the rest of the paper.\r
3.1 The case of subdividing an edge into two edges\r
The construction of the Dirac operator, which will be carried out in the fol\u0002lowing subsections, looks cumbersome, but is really forced upon us by the\r
requirement of consistency with the maps between different graphs. There\u0002fore, in order to present the construction without the full notational weight,\r
we will first demonstrate the case where the triangulation consists of one edge\r
and where we consider the step going to the first barycentric subdivision. We\r
thus have A0 = G, A1 = G2 and P0,1(g1, g2) = g1g2.\r
16

For Γ0 we choose a left and right invariant metric h·, ·i on G. Let ˆei be\r
an orthonormal basis for TidG and let Eˆ\r
i(g) = Lgeˆi be the corresponding left\r
translated vector fields. Define the Dirac operator\r
D0(ξ) = XEˆ\r
i∇Eˆi\r
(ξ),\r
where ∇ is some SO(dim(G))-valued connection and ξ ∈ L\r
2\r
(G, Cl(T G)),\r
where Cl(T G) denotes the Clifford bundle.\r
We want to construct D1 acting on L\r
2\r
(G2, Cl(G2)) on the form\r
D1(ξ) = X\r
j\r
Kj∇Kj(ξ),\r
where Kjis an orthonormal frame in T G2, such that\r
P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
(D0(ξ)) = D1(P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
(ξ)).\r
First we have to make sense of P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
. Since P0,1 induces maps\r
(P0,1)∗ : T G2 → T G , and P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
: T\r
∗G → T∗G2\r
between tangent and cotangent spaces it is also natural to let the Dirac op\u0002erators act on Cl(T\r
∗G), resp. Cl(T∗G2\r
) instead of Cl(T G), resp. Cl(T G2).\r
This is easily done once we have chosen a metric on T\r
∗G and resp. T∗G2\r
. In\r
order for\r
P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
: L\r
2\r
(G, Cl(T\r
∗G)) → L2\r
(G\r

, Cl(T\r
∗G2\r
))\r
to be an embedding of Hilbert spaces, and in fact to be defined at the level of\r
Clifford bundles, the map induced by P0,1 at the level of cotangent bundles,\r
also denoted P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
, must be metric.\r
Let w ∈ T\r
∗\r
g G. It is easy to see that\r
P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
(w) = (Rg\r
−1\r
2\r
w, Lg\r
−1\r
1\r
w), g1g2 = g,\r
where\r
Rg\r
−1\r
2\r
(w)(v) = w(Rg2v)\r
and\r
Lg\r
−1\r
1\r
(w)(v) = w(Lg1v)\r
17

. We ensure that P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
: T\r
∗G → T∗G2\r
is metric by defining the inner product\r
on T\r
∗G2\r
h(w1, w2),(w3, w4)i2 =\r
1\r
2\r
(hw1, w3i + hw2, w4i).\r
Denote by Ei the cotangent vector field which is dual to Eˆ\r
i via h·, ·i.\r
Using the inner product on G2 we get from P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
(Ei) a vector field on G2. A\r
small computation shows that this vector field equals\r
(Lg1Lg2Rg\r
−1\r
2\r
eˆi, Lg2eˆi) =: (Eˆ1\r
i\r
, Eˆ2\r
i\r
). (2)\r
Put Eˆ+\r
i = (Eˆ1i\r
, Eˆ2\r
i\r
) and Eˆ−\r
i = (Eˆ1i\r
, −Eˆ2\r
i\r
). Since {Eˆ±\r
i\r
}iis an orthonormal frame\r
for T G2it is natural to try to define\r
D1(ξ) = X\r
i\r

where ξ ∈ L\r

(G2, Cl(T\r
∗G2\r
)) and where {E ±\r
i\r
} is the corresponding orthonor\u0002mal frame for T\r
∗G2\r
. A small computation shows that\r
Eˆ+\r

(P\r

Eˆ−\r
i\r
(P\r

We therefore define\r

Next, write an element in ξ ∈ L\r
2\r
(G, T∗G) as\r
ξ =\r

where ξi ∈ L\r
2\r
(G). Hence\r
P\r

0,1\r
(ξ) = X\r
i\r
P\r
∗\r
0,1\r
(ξi)E\r

We calculate\r
D1(P\r

If we therefore require ∇ to be a SO(2dim(G))-valued connection in T\r
∗G2\r
satisfying\r
∇Eˆ+\r

we see that P\r

(D0(ξ)) = D1(P\r

0,1\r
(ξ)) for all ξ ∈ L\r
2\r
(G, Cl(T\r
∗G)).\r
3.2 A Riemannian metric\r
Due to lemma 2.2.2 we have at each level the identification Ak = Gnk , where\r
nk is the number of edges in Γk. We want to construct a Riemannian metric\r
on TAk = T Gnk . However, we require the metric to be consistent with the\r
embeddings of graphs. Embeddings of graphs Γk ⊂ Γk+1 induces a surjective\r
smooth map\r
Pk,k+1 : Ak+1 → Ak,\r
and therefore a map of tangent bundles\r
(Pk,k+1)∗ : TAk+1 → TAk.\r
Dualizing this map we get an embedding\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 : T\r
∗Ak → T∗Ak+1\r
of cotangent bundles.\r
We want to construct the Hilbert space on which the Dirac operator acts\r
as a inductive limit of Hilbert spaces. It is hence natural to construct the\r
metric on the cotangent bundle of Ak, since we have canonical maps\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 : L\r
2\r
(Ak, T∗Ak) → L\r
2\r
(Ak+1, T∗Ak+1).\r
Definition 3.2.1 Let h·, ·i be a left and right invariant Riemannian metric\r
on T\r
∗G. Let Γk be the graph consisting of the edges in Tk, the k’s barycentric\r
subdivision of T0. On T\r
∗Ak = T∗Gnk define\r
h·, ·ik =\r
1\r
2\r
k\r
h·, ·ink, (3)\r
where h·, ·ink is the product metric on T\r
∗Gnk .\r
19

Proposition 3.2.2 The map\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 : T\r
∗Ak → T∗Ak+1\r
preserves the metric (3).\r
Proof. We subdivide Gnk+1 as G2nk × Gn2, where G2nk corresponds to\r
subdivision of the edges in Γk and Gn2 corresponds to the new edges added\r
when going from k to k + 1. Write\r
T\r
∗\r
(g1,...,gnk+1)Ak+1 = T\r
∗\r
g1G ⊕ · · · ⊕ T\r
∗\r
gnk+1\r
G.\r
We choose orientations of the edges in such a way that\r
Pk,k+1(g1, . . . , gnk+1) = (g1g2, g3g4, . . . , g2nk−1g2nk).\r
For a tangent vector v = (v1, . . . , vnk+1) in T\r
∗Ak+1 we have\r
(Pk,k+1)∗(v) = (Lg1v2 + Rg2v1, Lg3v4 + Rg4v3, . . . , Lg2nk−1v2nk + Rg2nkv2nk−1),\r
where Lg means left translation of tangent vectors and Rg right translation.\r
Hence for a cotangent vector w = (w1, . . . , wnk) in T\r
∗\r
(g1g2,...,g2nk−1g2nk\r
)Ak we\r
have\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1(w) = (Rg\r
−1\r
2\r
w1, Lg\r
−1\r
1\r
w1, . . . , Rg\r
−1\r
2nk\r
wnk, L2nk−1wnk, 0, . . . , 0),\r
where by definition\r
Lg(w)(v) = w(Lg−1(v)), Rg(w)(v) = w(Rg−1 (v)), v ∈ T G, w ∈ T\r
∗G.\r
From this and the left and right invariance of h·, ·i the proposition follows. ⊳\r
By proposition 3.2.2 the map P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 induces a map, also denoted P\r
∗\r
k,k+1,\r
from Cl(T\r
∗Ak) to Cl(T∗Ak+1), where Cl(T∗Ak) denotes the Clifford bundle\r
of T\r
∗Ak with respect to h·, ·ik. Furthermore this map is isometric. We thus\r
get embeddings of Hilbert spaces\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 : L\r
2\r
(Ak, Cl(T\r
∗Ak)) → L2\r
(Ak+1, Cl(T\r
∗Ak+1).\r
Definition 3.2.3 Put Hk = L\r
2\r
(Ak, Cl(T\r
∗Ak)). Define\r
H = lim−→Hk,\r
the inductive limit of of the system {Hk, P∗\r
k,k+1}k.\r
Due to proposition 2.4.2 we can consider H as L\r
2\r
(A\r
△\r
, Cl(A\r
△\r
)) or more\r
freely written L\r
2\r
(A, Cl(A)).\r
20

3.3 Some special covector fields\r
For the general construction of the Dirac operator we will need some special\r
covector fields generalizing duals of the vector fields (2). For notational\r
simplicity we will only present the construction on a single edge which is\r
then subdivided infinitely many times. Thus An = G2\r
n\r
and the structure\r
maps are given by\r
Pn−1,n(g1, g2, . . . , g2n−1, g2n ) = (g1g2, . . . , g2n−1g2n ).\r
Let {ei} be an orthonormal basis of T\r
∗\r
idG. Define covector fields on A0 = G\r
by\r
E\r
0,1\r
i\r
(g) = Lg(ei).\r
The construction of the covector fields on An will be by induction. Assume\r
that covector fields\r
{Ej,k\r
i\r
}j≤n−1,k≤2\r
j−1\r
on An−1 has been defined (For j = 0 the set k ≤ 2\r
j−1\r
is {1}). We adopt the\r
notation\r
E\r
1\r
i = Lg1g2···g2n R(g2g3···g2n )−1 ei\r
E\r
2\r
i = Lg2g3···g2n R(g3g4···g2n )−1 ei\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
for covector fields on G depending on g1, . . . , g2n . Define covector fields on\r
An by\r
{P\r
∗\r
n−1,n(E\r
j,k\r
i\r
)}j≤n−1,k≤2\r
j−1\r
and\r
E\r
n,1\r
i = 2n−1\r
(E\r

i = 2n−1\r
(0, 0, E\r
3\r
i\r
, −E 4\r
i\r
, 0, . . . , 0)\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
With sloppy notation we will also write E\r
j,k\r
i\r
instead of P\r
∗\r
n−1,n(E\r
j,k\r
i\r
).\r
Lemma 3.3.1 {Ej,k\r
i\r
}j≤n,k≤2\r
j−1 is an orthonormal frame for T\r
∗An with re\u0002spect to the inner product h·, ·in.\r
21

Proof. Since P\r
∗\r
n−1,n preserves the inner product by proposition 3.2.2 it\r
is enough to check that {En,k\r
i\r
}k≤2\r
j−1 are orthonormal and are orthogonal to\r
{Ej,k\r
i\r
}j≤n−1,k≤2\r
j−1.\r
It is clear that {En,k\r
i\r
}k≤2\r
j−1 are orthonormal. By induction and the\r
computation in the proof of proposition 3.2.2 we see that the vectors in\r
{Ej,k\r
i\r
}j≤n−1,k≤2\r
j−1 are of the form\r
(c1E\r
1\r
i\r
, c1E\r
2\r
i\r
, c2E\r

i\r
, c2E\r

, . . . , c2n−1 E\r
2\r
n−1\r
i\r
, c2n−1 E\r
2\r
n\r
i\r
).\r
From this the lemma follows. ⊳\r
3.4 Construction of the Dirac operator\r
We want to construct a Dirac type operator acting on H. For this we con\u0002struct Dirac type operators acting on Hn which are consistent with P\r
∗\r
n,n+1.\r
We first need to determine sufficient conditions on the connections which\r
permit the existence of the Dirac operator.\r
Let Eˆj,k\r
i be the vector field obtained from E\r
j,k\r
i by using h·, ·in to identify\r
T\r
∗An with TAn. Also let ˆei denote the basis in TidG obtained from ei by\r
using h·, ·i to identify TidG with T\r
∗\r
idG. Note also under this identification the\r
covectorfield\r
(0, . . . , 0, E\r
j\r
i\r
, 0, . . .)\r
gets mapped to\r
1\r
2\r
n\r
(0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1···g2n )−1 eˆi, 0, . . . , 0).\r
Definition 3.4.1 A system of connections {∇n}n, where ∇nis a connection\r
in T\r
∗An is called admissible if ∇n\r
is a SO(2n· dim(G))-valued connection\r
and if\r

We want to define the Dirac operator in the usual fashion using an admissible\r
family of connection, i.e. at each level it should be on the form\r
Dn =\r

j,k\r
i\r

22

Proposition 3.4.2 Let {∇n} be an admissible system of connections and let\r
{a\r
j,k}k≤2\r
j−1 be a sequence of complex numbers. For ξ ∈ Hn define\r
Dn(ξ) = X\r

Then\r
P\r

n,n+1(Dn(ξ)) = Dn+1(P\r

n,n+1(ξ))\r
and hence the system of operators {Dn} defines a densely defined operator D\r
on H.\r
Proof. We first check the identity on functions, i.e. ξ ∈ L\r

P\r

3.5 Gauge invariance\r
In section 2.2.2 we have constructed a left action of G\r
△\r
on A\r
△\r
. It follows from\r
the construction that this action preserves the inner product on L\r
2\r
(A\r
△\r
), and\r
hence is a unitary action of G\r
△\r
on L\r
2\r
(A\r
△\r
). In order to talk about gauge\r
invariance of of the Dirac operator we first need to extend this action to a\r
unitary action on L\r
2\r
(A\r
△\r
, Cl(A\r
△\r
)).\r
Let U be a gauge transformation written as\r
Un(g1, . . . , g2n ) = (u0g1u\r
−1\r
1\r
, . . . , u2n−1g2n u\r
−1\r
2n ),\r
on An, where u0, . . . , u2n ∈ G. Since the metric is left and right invariant in\r
each copy of G, we see that (Un)\r
∗\r
: T\r
∗An → T∗An preserves the metric and\r
therefore U extends to a unitary on L\r
2\r
(A\r
△\r
, Cl(A\r
△\r
)). This unitary will also\r
be denoted by U.\r
A vectorfield of the form\r
(g1, . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj···g2n R(gj+1···g2n )−1 eˆi\r
, 0, . . . , 0)\r
gets mapped to\r
(u0g1u\r
−1\r
1\r
, . . . , u2n−1g2n u\r
−1\r
2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Luj−1gj ···g2n R(u\r
−1\r
j\r
gj+1···g2n )−1 eˆi\r
, 0, . . . , 0),\r
under (Un)∗. Written differently\r
(g1, . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1···g2n )−1 u2n eˆiu\r
−1\r
2n , 0, . . . , 0).\r
25

Therefore (Un)\r
∗\r
is, on a covector field of the form\r
(g1, . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1···g2n )−1 ei, 0, . . . , 0),\r
given by\r
(g1, . . . , g2n ) → (0, . . . , 0, Lgj ···g2n R(gj+1···g2n )−1 u\r
−1\r
2n eiu2n , 0, . . . , 0).\r
Put fi = u2n eiu2n . Since {fi} be another orthonormal basis for the dual of\r
the Lie algebra of G, there exist a matrix Oij ∈ O(dim(G)) with\r
fi =\r
X\r
j\r
Oijej.\r
From the construction of the covector fields {Ej,k\r
i\r
} it follows that\r
U(E\r

) = X\r
l\r
OilE\r
j,k\r

It turns out that the operator D is not always gauge invariant. We\r
therefore need\r

△\r
.\r
Note that the system of trivial connections with respect to the trivializa\u0002tions given by {Ej,k\r
i\r
} is a gauge admissible system of connections.\r
Proposition 3.5.2 When D is constructed from a gauge admissible connec\u0002tion, D is gauge invariant, i.e. D = UDU∗\r
for all U ∈ G\r
△\r
.\r
Proof. Let ξ ∈ L\r

4 A semifinite spectral triple\r
In this section we will construct a semifinite spectral associated to A\r
△\r
or\r
rather to the algebra of holonomy loops, see definition 4.1.1. The following\r
definition first appeared [6].\r
Definition 4.0.3 Let N be a semifinite von Neumann algebra with a semifi\u0002nite trace τ . Let Kτ be the τ - compact operators. A semifinite spectral triple\r
(B, H, D) is a ∗-subalgebra B of N , a representation of N on the Hilbert space\r
H and an unbounded densely defined self adjoint operator D on H affiliated\r
with N satisfying\r
1. b(λ − D)\r
−1 ∈ Kτ for all b ∈ B and λ /∈ R..\r
2. [b, D] is densely defined and extends to a bounded operator.\r
4.1 The algebra\r
Let v be a vertex in S△. Denote by HGv(S△) the subgroupoid of HG(S△)\r
of loops based in v, i.e. paths starting and ending in v. Let G → MN be a\r
27

unitary matrix representation of G and let H′ = H ⊗ MN . Hence\r
H′ = lim−→(Hn ⊗ MN ).\r
Definition 4.1.1 Let L be a loop in HGv(S△). Let ξ ∈ Hn ⊗ MN , where n\r
is such that L ∈ HG(n). Define\r
L(ξ)(∇) = ∇(L)ξ(∇), ∇ ∈ An = Hom(HG(n), G).\r
Since\r
P\r
∗\r
n,m(L(ξ)) = L(P\r
∗\r
n,m(ξ))\r
we get a densely defined operator on H′, also denoted L. Clearly L is bounded.\r
Denote by Bv the ∗-algebra generated by {L}L∈HGv(S△). We will call Bv\r
the algebra of holonomy loops.\r
Proposition 4.1.2 For L ∈ HGv(S△) define the function HL : A → MN\r
by\r
HL(∇) = Hol(L, ∇).\r
The ∗-algebra generated by {HL}L∈HGv(S△) equipped with the sup norm is\r
isomorphic to Bv as normed ∗-algebra.\r
Proof. Follows from the dense embedding A → A\r
△\r
. ⊳\r
4.2 The trace and the von Neumann algebra\r
Let\r
An = K(L\r
2\r
(An)) ⊗ Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn) ⊗ End(MN ).\r
where K(L\r
2\r
(An)) denotes the compact operators on L\r
2\r
(An). We define maps,\r
with an abuse of notation also denoted P\r
∗\r
n,n+1, from An to An+1 in the fol\u0002lowing way\r
• On End(MN ), P\r
∗\r
n,n+1 is the identity.\r
• On K(L\r
2\r
(An)), P\r
∗\r
n,n+1 is the map induced by the embedding\r
P\r
∗\r
n,n+1 : L\r
2\r
(An) → L\r
2\r
(An+1),\r
i.e. if Pn,n+1 denotes the projection in L\r
2\r
(An+1) onto P\r
∗\r
n,n+1(L\r
2\r
(An))\r
we have\r
K(L\r
2\r
(An)) ∋ a → aPn,n+1 ∈ K(L\r
2\r
(An+1)).\r
28

• We use the map\r
Pn,n+1 : Cl(T\r
∗An) → Cl(T∗An+1),\r
which has already been defined in subsection 3.2 and restrict it to the\r
identity. If we write\r
T\r
∗\r
idAn+1 = T\r
∗\r
idAn ⊕ Vn,n+1,\r
and hence\r
Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn+1) = Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn)⊗ˆ Cl(Vn,n+1),\r
then\r
P\r
∗\r
n,n+1 : Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn) → Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn+1)\r
is given by\r
P\r
∗\r
n,n+1(E) = E ⊗ 1Cl(Vn,n+1)\r
.\r
Note that P\r
∗\r
n,n+1 is a C\r
∗\r
-algebra homomorphism. Therefore {An} is an in\u0002ductive system of C\r
∗\r
-algebras. Let\r
A = lim An\r
be the inductive limit. By\r
P\r
∗\r
n,∞ : An → A,\r
we denote the induced embeddings.\r
From the construction of A it follows that\r
A = K(L\r
2\r
(A)) ⊗ B ⊗ MN , (4)\r
where B is a UHF-algebra. Since the dimension of the Clifford algebra is a\r
power of 2 when n ≥ 1, B is the CAR-algebra.\r
There is a trace T r on Ak defined by\r
T r = T ro ⊗ T rn ⊗ T ro,\r
where T ro are the operator traces on K(L\r
2\r
(Ak)), resp. End(MN ) and T rn\r
is the normalized trace on Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAk). By construction\r
T r(a) = T r(P\r
∗\r
k,k+1(a)),\r
29

and hence defines a densely defined trace on A.\r
Using the trivialization {Ej,k\r
i\r
} of T\r
∗\r
idAn we see that A acts on H′\r
. In fact\r
H′factors like (4) into\r
H′ = L\r
2\r
(A) ⊗ Cl(T\r
∗\r
idA) ⊗ MN .\r
Note that the action of B on Cl(T\r
∗\r
idA) is just the GNS-representation of B\r
with respect to the normalized trace on B.\r
Definition 4.2.1 Let N be the weak closure of A in B(H′). The trace τ :\r
N → C is defined as the extension of the trace T r on A to N .\r
Note that τ is a semifinite trace, since it is the tensor product of the usual\r
semifinite trace on B(H), H separable, and the finite trace on the hyperfinite\r
II1 factor B\r
w\r
.\r
4.3 A coordinate change and selfadjointness of the Dirac\r
operator\r
We define the coordinate transformation\r
Θn : An = G\r
2\r
n → G\r
2\r
n\r
by\r
Θn(g1, . . . , g2n ) = (g1g2 · · · g2n , g2g3 · · · g2n , . . . , g2n−1g2n , g2n ).\r
It is easy to see that Θn preserves the Haar measure on G2\r
n\r
.\r
The inverse of θn is given by\r
Θ\r
−1\r
n\r
(g1, . . . , g2n ) = (g1g\r
−1\r
2\r
, g2g\r
−1\r
3\r
, . . . , g2n−1g\r
−1\r
2n , g2n ),\r
The main purpose of Θn is the following:\r
An is a trivial G2\r
n−1\r
-principal fiber bundle over An−1, where the action\r
of G2\r
n−1\r
on An is given by\r
(g1, . . . , g2n−1 )(g\r
′\r
1\r
, . . . , g′\r
2n ) = (g\r
′\r
1\r
g\r

, . . . , g′\r
2n−1\r
g\r
−1\r
2n−1 , g2n−1 g\r
′\r
2n ).\r
30

Combining this with Θn we get the following commutative diagram\r

where pro means projection onto the odd coordinates, i.e.\r
pro(g1, g2, . . . , g2n−1, g2n ) = (g1, g3, . . . , g2n−1).\r
In other words {Θn} is just a consistent way of trivializing the principal\r
bundles.\r
Lemma 4.3.1 Let Eˆ\r
i(g) = Lg(ˆei), the left translate of eˆi\r
. On An we have\r
((Θn)∗(Eˆn,k\r

1\r
2\r
(0, . . . , 0, Eˆ\r

We will also write Eˆj\r

(g1, . . . , g2n ) = (0, . . . , Eˆ\r

Proposition 4.3.2 Let {∇n} be an admissible system of connections. As\u0002sume that D0 is self adjoint,\r
∇\r
n\r
Eˆj,k\r
i\r
(E\r
n,m\r
l\r
) = 0 for all i, j, k, m, l, and all n ≥ 1\r
and that a\r
j,k are real and non zero for all j, k. Then D is self adjoint.\r
Proof. We will prove that Dn is formally self adjoint for each n. From this\r
the statement follows because Dn is an elliptic pseudo differential operator\r
on a compact manifold and therefore by elliptic regularity Dn is self adjoint.\r
We can even find an orthonormal basis for H′\r
n which diagonalizes Dn with\r
real eigenvalues. We can therefore find an orthonormal basis for H′ which\r
diagonalizes D with real eigenvalues. Hence D is self adjoint.\r
Write\r
Dn =\r

By the assumptions on the connection and lemma 4.3.1 the first summand\r
on the right hand side is a linear combination of D0’s acting on the different\r
copies of G, and thus by assumption self adjoint. The second summand is,\r
in the trivialization induced by {Ej,k\r
i\r
} and transported by Θn on the form\r

a\r

j,k\r
i\r
d(Θn)∗(Eˆj,k\r

,\r
where d is the exterior derivative. Since (Θn)∗(Eˆj,k\r
i\r
) is a left invariant vector\r
field according to lemma 4.3.1, d(Θn)∗(Eˆj,k\r
i\r
)\r
is formally skew self adjoint. The\r
formal selfadjointness now follows since Clifford multiplication with E\r
j,k\r
i\r
is\r
also skew self adjoint and commutes with d(Θn)∗(Eˆj,k\r
i\r
)\r
. ⊳\r
4.4 Affiliation of D\r
The spectral projections of Dn will by construction belong to\r
K(L\r
2\r
(An)) ⊗ End(Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn)) ⊗ End(MN ).\r
Since we can split Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn) into irreducible representations of Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn),\r
and Dn acts on each of these, the spectral projections of Dn is in\r
An = K(L\r
2\r
(An)) ⊗ Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn) ⊗ End(MN ).\r
32

Recall from section 4.2 the splitting\r
T\r
∗\r
idAn+1 = T\r
∗\r
idAn ⊕ Vn,n+1.\r
More generally we can write\r
T\r
∗\r
idAm = T\r
∗\r
idAn ⊕ Vn,m,\r
and we thus have\r
Cl(T\r
∗\r
idG\r
m) = Cl(Vn,m)⊗ˆ Cl(T∗\r
idAn). (5)\r
We assume that the system of connections defining the Dirac operator\r
satisfies the properties in 4.3.2. These properties ensure the following equa\u0002tion:\r
Dm(P\r
∗\r
n,m(ξ) ⊗ v) = P\r

n,m(Dn(ξ)) ⊗ v, ξ ∈ H′n\r
, v ∈ Cl(Vn,m).\r
If ξ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue λ, then P\r
∗\r
n,m(ξ)⊗v is an eigenvector with\r
eigenvalue λ if v ∈ Cl(Vn,m). Therefore, if Pλ,n is the spectral of eigenvalue λ\r
of Dn the projection P\r
∗\r
n,∞(Pλ,n) is a subprojection of the spectral projection\r
of eigenvalue λ of D. By construction P\r

n,∞(Pλ,n) ∈ N\r
⊳\r
Proposition 4.4.1 The spectral projections of the Dirac operator is con\u0002tained in N .\r
Proof. For a spectral projection Pλ of eigenvalue λ of D we have\r
P\r
∗\r
n,∞(Pλ,n) ր Pλ.\r
Hence Pλ is in the weak closure of A, i.e. Pλ ∈ N . ⊳\r
Corollary 4.4.2 The operator D is affiliated with N .\r
4.5 The main theorem\r
We begin by enlarging our Hilbert space slightly. Let H = H′ ⊗ Cl(1). We\r
also enlarge N by tensoring with Cl(1). By abuse of notation we will also\r
call the enlargement N . The trace τ is also enlarged by tensoring with the\r
normalized trace on Cl(1) and denoted by τ .\r
33

The Dirac operator extends to an operator on H. We write\r
Dn =\r
X\r
j<n,k,i\r
a\r
j,kE\r
j,k\r
i ∇n\r
Eˆj,k\r

Eˆn,k\r

= D\r

.\r
After changing coordinates with Θn we have\r
D\r

n =\r
X\r
k,i\r
a\r
n,kE\r
n,k\r
i ∇n\r
Eˆ2k\r

.\r
Therefore, when we use Θn to trivialize\r
An = An−1 × G\r
2\r
n−1\r
we see that D−\r
n\r
is an operator acting only in the fiber, i.e. in the G2\r
n−1\r
part\r
of An. There is an embedding of\r
L\r
2\r
(An−1) ⊗ Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn) ⊗ MN ⊗ Cl(1) (6)\r
in Ker(D−\r
n\r
) by identifying it as a subspace of Hn. Let Pn be the projection\r
onto the orthogonal complement of (6) in Ker(D−\r
n\r
). Define\r
Dn,p = Dn +\r
X\r
j\r
b\r
j\r
ePj,\r
where bj ∈ iR, e is the generator of Cl(1) and where we have used P\r
∗\r
j,j+1 to\r
push forward Pj. Note that Dn,p is self adjoint. By construction\r
P\r
∗\r
n,n+1(Dn,p(ξ)) = Dn+1,p(ξ),\r
and therefore {Dn,p} defines a densely defined self adjoint operator Dp on H.\r
Since D is affiliated with N by corollary 4.4.2, so is Dp by construction.\r
Theorem 4.5.1 There exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and {bk} such that (Bv, H, Dp)\r
is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to (N , τ ).\r
Proof. The selfadjointness and affiliation to N of Dp are already taken\r
care of. What remains is to prove that [b, Dp] ∈ B(H) and that b(λ−Dp)\r
−1 ∈\r
Kτ for all b ∈ Bv.\r
The boundedness of the commutator: Let L be a loop in Γn. If we write\r
Hn = L\r
2\r
(G\r
2\r
n\r
) ⊗ Cl(T\r
∗An) ⊗ MN ⊗ Cl(1)\r
34

the loop operator L acts by point wise matrix multiplication over G2\r
n\r
in\r
the MN factor, i.e. the matrix entries is of the form f(g1, . . . , g2n ). The\r
action of L on Hn+1 is then matrix multiplication with entries of the form\r
f(g1g2, . . . , g2n+1−1g2n+1 ). Conjugating the operator with Θn+1 we see, since\r
Θ\r
−1\r
n+1(g1, . . . , g2n+1 ) = (g1g\r
−1\r
2\r
, g2g\r
−1\r
3\r
, . . . , g2n−1g\r
−1\r
2n+1 , g2n+1),\r
that the result is independent of g2, g4, . . . , g2n+1, and thus [L, D−\r
n+1] = 0.\r
It therefore follows that [L, Pn+1] = 0. Hence [L, Dn+1,p] = [L, Dn,p] and\r
therefore [L, Dp] is bounded.\r
To prove that there exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and bj such Dp has τ -compact\r
resolvent we will prove that for any real sequence cn converging to ∞ we can\r
choose a\r
n,k and bn such that the new eigenvalues, modulo the extra multi\u0002plicity of the existing eigenvalue due to the growth of the Clifford bundle,\r
introduced by going from (Dn−1,p)\r
2\r
to (Dn,p)\r
2 are bigger than cn.\r
In the following we will omit the MN part. This will play no role, since the\r
Dirac operator does not act on the MN part. First we rewrite the operator\r
in the following way\r

Using the coordinate change Θn we factorize\r
Hn = L\r

(G\r

) ⊗ L\r
2\r
(G\r

where H1 = L\r
2\r
(G2\r
n−1\r
) corresponds to the coordinates (g1, g3, . . . , g2n−1) un\u0002der Θn and H2\r
corresponds to the coordinates (g2, g4, . . . , g2n ). In particular\r
by lemma 4.3.1, D−\r
n,p acts trivially on H1\r
. Taking the square of Dn,p we get\r
(Dn,p)\r
2 = (D+\r

n,p, D+n,p} + a\r
2\r
(D\r

Using lemma 4.3.1 it is easy to see that {D−\r
n,p, D+n,p} does not act on H1\r
.\r
Let ξ belong to the orthogonal complement of H1⊗1⊗Cl(T\r
∗\r
idAn)⊗Cl(1).\r
We know, due to the fact that Dp is self adjoint and commutes with the maps\r
P\r
∗\r
k,k+1 that this complement is an invariant subspace for Dp. Decompose ξ\r
with respect to the above decomposition of Hn into\r
ξ =\r

where {ξ\r

∗\r
idAn) ⊗ Cl(1)\r
in\r

Combining (7) and (8) we get\r

Since (D−\r

The sequence {bn} is needed in the case when the operator\r
De =\r
X\r
i\r
EidEˆi,\r
where Eˆ\r
i\r
is an orthonormal frame of left translated vectorfields on one copy\r
of G, has a non trivial kernel in the sense that the kernel is given by the span\r
of {Ei}i. This is clearly not the case for U(1). In the appendix we will show\r
that this is also not the case for SU(2).\r
Proposition 4.5.2 When Db is constructed from a gauge admissible sys\u0002tem of connections satisfying the demands in proposition 4.3.2, Db is gauge\r
invariant, i.e. Db = UDbU\r
∗\r
for all U ∈ G\r
△\r
. (U acts trivially on the Cl(1)-\r
part.)\r
Proof. From the proof of proposition 3.5.2 it follows that D−\r
n\r
is gauge\r
invariant, i.e. invariant under Un for all Un ∈ Gn. In particular the kernel of\r
D−\r
n\r
is gauge invariant. Also the space (6) is invariant under Gn and therefore\r
the projection Pn onto the orthogonal complement of (6) in the kernel of D−\r
n\r
is gauge invariant under Gn. From this the invariance follows. ⊳\r
Note that the system of trivial connections with respect to the trivializa\u0002tions given by {Ej,k\r
i\r
} fulfills the the demands of proposition 4.5.2.\r
5 Appendix\r
In this appendix we will first demonstrate the case of U(1) to show what kind\r
of growth conditions are needed on a\r
j,k. Secondly we show that for SU(2)\r
the perturbation with the Pn’s is not needed to obtain a semifinite spectral\r
triple.\r
37

5.1 The U(1)-case\r
We write U(1) = {e\r
2πiθ|θ ∈ [0, 1]} and choose the metric such that\r
h\r
d\r
dθ ,\r
d\r
dθ i = 1.\r
The system of connections we will use is the system of trivial connections.\r
The operator Dn has the form\r
X\r
j≤n,k,i\r
a\r
j,kE\r
j,k\r
i dEˆj,k\r
i\r
Since i can be only one in this formula, we will simply omit it. Also we will\r
assume that a\r
j,k1 = aj,k2\r
for all k1, k2, and simply denote aj:= a\r
j,k. All Eˆj,k\r
commute. Hence\r
D\r
2\r
n = −\r
X\r
j≤n,k\r
a\r
2\r
j\r
(dEˆj,k )\r
2\r
.\r
Since D2\r
n acts trivially in the Clifford bundle, and since the identity on the\r
Clifford bundle is normalized to have trace 1, we will omit the Clifford bundle\r
in the rest of this computation.\r
We will use the coordinate change Θn to rewrite D2\r
n\r
. The rewritten\r
operator will be denoted D˜ 2\r
n\r
. According to lemma 4.3.1 the vector fields\r
Eˆj,k = c\r

2\r
∂θ2k. It follows from the construction\r
that\r
X\r
j<n,k\r
|c\r

In particular for a function\r
ξ(θ1, . . . , θ2n ) = e\r
2πiθ2n l\r

we see that\r
D˜ 2\r

.\r
From this follows, that D only has finite many eigenvalues with finite multi\u0002plicity module the semifinite trace in a bounded set of R if\r
an → ∞. (9)\r
This is therefore a necessary condition for D to have τ -compact resolvent.\r
On the other hand the eigenfunctions for D˜ 2\r
n\r
are on the form\r
exp(2πi(\r
X\r
l≤2n\r
nlθl)).\r
The eigenfunctions for D˜ 2\r
n−1\r
are the functions on the form\r
exp(2πi(\r
X\r
l≤2n−1\r
n2l−1θl)).\r
Hence the smallest new eigenvalue appearing from going to from n − 1 to n\r
is bigger than a\r
2\r
n\r
. Hence D has τ -compact resolvent if and only of condition\r
(9) is satisfied.\r
5.2 The SU(2)-case\r
We will show that the Dirac operator on SU(2) on the form\r
De =\r
X\r
i\r
EidEˆ\r
i\r
,\r
where d is understood with respect to the trivialization given by {Ei}, has\r
a trivial kernel in the sense that the kernel is given by the span of {Ei}i.\r
In other words the kernel consists of the constants with respect to the triv\u0002ialization of the Clifford bundle given by {Ei}i\r
. Accoording to the remark\r
after the proof of 4.5.1 this ensures that the perturbation with the Pn’s is\r
not needed.\r
For the analysis of we will use that states |jmi, where j ∈ {0,\r
1\r
2\r
, 1, . . .}\r
and m ∈ {−j, −j + 1, . . . j − 1, j} form an orthonormal basis for L\r
2\r
(SU(2)).\r
Choose a basis ˆe1, eˆ2, eˆ3 for su(2) such that\r
[ˆei, eˆj] = X\r
k\r
εijkeˆk.\r
39

Define a metric on su(2) by letting ˆe1, eˆ2, eˆ3 be an orthonormal basis. Note\r
this metric by left and right translation define a left and right invariant metric\r
on SU(2).\r
The action of the corresponding left translated vectorfields of ˆe1, eˆ2, eˆ3 is\r
best described by forming the raising and lowering operators\r
eˆ± = ˆe1 ± iˆe2 .\r
The action of the translated vectorfields is given by\r
dEˆ3|jmi = −im|jmi, dEˆ±\r
|jmi = −ic±(m)|jm ± 1i,\r
where\r
c±(m) = p\r
(j ∓ m)(j ± m + 1).\r
We will restrict the operator De to acting in one of the two irreducible repre\u0002sentations of Cl(T\r
∗\r
idSU(2)) instead of the full Clifford bundle. We chose the\r
representation in M2 given by\r

2 = (j + m)(j − m + 1) = j2 + j − m2 + m ≤ j2 + 2j.\r
Hence for j ≥\r

2\r
these matrices are clearly invertible. For j = 1 and j =\r
1\r
2\r
it\r
can easily be checked that these matrices are invertible. In particular we see\r

e has trivial kernel.\r
Choosing the other irreducible representation of Cl(T\r

A semifinite spectral triple for an algebra canonically associated to\r

based loops in a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions. The\r
underlying space can be seen as a gauge fixing of the unconstrained\r
state space of Loop Quantum Gravity. This paper is the second of\r

One of the most striking application of Noncommutative Geometry [9] is\r
Connes’ derivation of the Standard Model of high energy physics [10, 8]. In\r
this derivation the Lagrangian of the full Standard Model coupled to gravity\r
emerges from the spectral action principle [7] applied to a specific almost\r
commutative geometry.\r
2

This formulation is, however, essentially classical and does, at a funda\u0002mental level, not involve quantization. This raises the question how the\r
quantization procedure of Quantum Field Theory fits into the framework\r
on Noncommutative Geometry. Since Connes’ formulation of the Standard\r
Model at its root is tied up to gravitation, a quantization scheme within the\r
framework of Noncommutative Geometry must be expected to involve, at\r
some level, quantum gravity.\r
In the papers [2] and [3] we started studying the question of formulating\r
a quantization scheme within Noncommutative Geometry using canonical\r
quantum gravity. Specifically, we were inspired by techniques applied in\r
Loop Quantum Gravity. The concrete aim was to construct a spectral triple\r
of a noncommutative algebra naturally associated to the unconstrained state\r
space of Loop Quantum Gravity. Due to technical difficulties we only suc\u0002ceeded in constructing a spectral triple on a space closely related to the state\r
space of Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
This paper is one of two papers presenting a more satisfactory solution\r
to the problem of constructing a spectral triple on the state space of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity as well as its physical interpretations. The paper [1] deals\r
with the physical background and interpretations of the construction, and we\r
therefore refer the reader to that paper for more thorough discussion. This\r
paper deals with the concise mathematical construction."""

title = "Content of the paper"
text = """
The unconstrained state space of Loop Quantum Gravity is the space of\r
SU(2)-connections in a trivial principal bundle on a three dimensional mani\u0002fold. Since the construction we do works for arbitrary manifolds and arbitrary\r
compact Lie-groups, and since we for physical applications might need it for\r
later use, we will formulate it in this generality.\r
We let G be a compact Lie group and assume we have some principal\r
G-fiber bundle P over a manifold M. The algebra associated to the space A\r
of connections in P we want to consider is the following:\r
Given a representation of G in MN and given a loop L in M define a\r
matrix valued function on A by\r
L(∇) = Hol(∇, L),\r
where Hol(∇, L) denotes the holonomy of ∇ along L. Let B be the algebra\r
3

generated by all loops based in a fixed point in M. This is the type of algebra\r
we want to consider.\r
The algebra B is an algebra of matrix valued functions over A. We will for\r
technical reasons explained below consider a smaller algebra than B. We will\r
take a triangulation of M and consider the algebra B△ which is constructed\r
like B but only includes loops lying in the edges of the triangulations, or\r
one of its barycentric subdivisions. B△ is also an algebra of matrix valued\r
functions over A. Since any loop can be approximated by a loop lying in the\r
edges of the triangulations, or one of its barycentric subdivisions, B△ can\r
be considered as an approximation to B. The crucial difference is that the\r
groups of all diffeomorphisms preserving the base point acts on B whereas\r
only the group differomorphisms preserving the chosen triangulation and its\r
barycentric subdivisions acts on B△.\r
In order to construct a spectral triple over B△ we need a representation of\r
B△. We therefore need to construct L\r
2\r
(A). A construction of L\r
2\r
(A) already\r
exists within Loop Quantum Gravity, due to Ashtekar and Lewandowski. It\r
turns out that this construction depends on a completion of A and that this\r
completion depends on a choice of a system S of graphs. In the case of B△\r
the relevant system of graphs is given by finite subgraphs of the triangulation\r
and its barycentric subdivision. The system of graphs considered in Loop\r
Quantum Gravity is that of graphs made up of piecewise real analytic edges\r
(of course assuming M to be real analytic).\r
Seen from a graph Γ with edges {ei}i=1,...,n the space of connections A\r
looks like Gn via\r
A ∋ ∇ → (Hol(∇, e1), . . . , Hol(∇, en)).\r
We will also denote AΓ := Gn. Of course AΓ tells little about A. However,\r
by letting the complexity of the graph grow we get a more and more refined\r
picture of A. This is implemented by noting that an embedding Γ1 ⊂ Γ2\r
naturally gives a map\r
PΓ1Γ2\r
: AΓ2 → AΓ1\r
,\r
and then simply define the completion of A as the projective limit of AΓ, i.e.\r
A\r
S\r
:= limΓ∈S ←−\r
AΓ,\r
We will prove that under some condition on S that A is densely embedded\r
in A\r
S\r
, and hence justifies the term completion."""

2\r
(A) is straightforward from this completion. Since\r
AΓ = Gn we define L\r
2\r
(AΓ) as square integrable functions on Gn with respect\r
to the Haar measure. The map PΓ1Γ2induces an embedding\r
PΓ1Γ2: L\r
2\r
(AΓ1) → L\r
2\r
(AΓ2),\r
and L\r
2\r
(A) is defined as an inductive limit\r
L\r
2\r
(A) := limΓ∈S −→\r
L\r
2\r
(AΓ).\r
The idea for constructing the Dirac operator is that AΓ = Gnis a classical\r
geometry and therefore has a canonical Gauß-Bonnet-Dirac operator. In\r
order to ensure that this defines an operator on the inductive limit we have\r
to make sure that the operator is compatible with the structure maps of\r
the projective limit. It is here the technical advantages of the triangulation\r
compared to piecewise real analytic graphs shows up. The triangulation\r
narrows down the types of structure maps appearing in the projective limit.\r
With this we can define a Dirac operator compatible with the structure maps.\r
It turns out that there is a lot freedom in the construction. Going from one\r
level in the inductive limit to the next level we add new copies of G which\r
corresponds to new degrees of freedom. Each of these degrees of freedom can\r
be scaled. The entire construction therefore comes with a sequence of real\r
non zero numbers {a\r
j,k}k≤j\r
, where j, k is just a labelling of the degrees of\r
freedoms convenient for the explicit construction.\r
However, the constructed Dirac operator together with the algebra B△\r
will not fulfil the requirement of a spectral triple. The problem comes from\r
the infinite dimensionality of the Clifford bundle of the space of connection.\r
We therefore need to treat the identity operator on the Clifford bundle as\r
a finite rank operator. The setting of semifinite spectral triples will allow\r
exactly this. The von Neumann algebra N appearing from this construction\r
is a tensor product of the bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space\r
and the weak closure of the CAR-algebra.\r
In order to obtain a semifinite spectral triple we still need to perturb the\r
operator. At each level in the inductive limit we have to add a bounded\r
perturbation roughly speaking of the form bjPj, where bjis a real number\r
and Pjis the projection onto a subspace related to the kernel of a part of\r
the Dirac operator at the j’th level.\r
The main result in the paper is 4.5.1 stating\r
Theorem There exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and {bj} such that B△ together with\r
5

the perturbated Dirac operator is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to\r
the trace on N .\r
In the appendix we will demonstrate the case of U(1) and show that for\r
SU(2) the perturbations are not needed.\r

Definition 2.1.1 Let γ be a continuous piecewise smooth map γ : [0, 1] → M\r

curve if γ˙(t) is non vanishing for all t ∈ [0, 1]. This requirement includes that\r
the left and right derivative of γ is non vanishing in the non smooth points.\r
We will call γ(0) the starting point and γ(1) the endpoint.\r
If γ1 and γ2 are simple curves where the endpoint of γ1 coincides with the\r

where the only intersection points are start or end points of the simple paths.\r
The paths are called the edges of the graph. We denote the set of edges\r
of Γ by EΓ. The points {ei(0), ej (1)} are called the vertices of Γ. We denote\r
the set of vertices by VΓ.\r
A graph is called connected if ∪i,tei(t) is connected.\r
We will consider paths on the graph. These are simply compositions of\r
edges and inverses of edges. We will also think of each vertex as a path in\r
the graph. Furthermore, we would like ei ◦ (ei)\r
−1\r
to be equal to the path\r
ei(0). We fix this with the following\r
Definition 2.1.4 Let Γ be a graph and let P(Γ) be the set of paths in Γ. We\r
define an equivalence relation ∼ on P(Γ) to be generated by\r
(ei)\r
−1\r

−1 ∼ ei(0).\r
The hoop groupoid HG(Γ) of path on Γ is defined by\r
HG(Γ) = P(Γ)/ ∼ .\r
This equivalence relation implies that if p1, p2, p3 ∈ P(Γ) and p1 ∼ p2\r
then p3 ◦ p1 ∼ p3 ◦ p2 and p1 ◦ p3 ∼ p2 ◦ p3 whenever the compositions are\r
defined. The units for HG(Γ) are the vertices of Γ. It is easy to see that\r
HG(Γ) is a groupoid.\r
Definition 2.1.5 Let Γ1, Γ2 be two graphs. We say that Γ1 is a subgraph of\r
Γ2, and we write Γ1 ⊂ Γ2, if the edges of Γ1 are compositions of the edges or\r
their inverses of Γ2.\r
Note that Γ1 ⊂ Γ2 implies that HG(Γ1) is a subgruopoid of HG(Γ2).\r
The relation ⊂ equips the set of graphs with a partial order. We are\r
interested in subsystems of the set of all graphs.\r
Definition 2.1.6 A system S of graphs is called directed if there for any\r
Γ1, Γ2 ∈ S exists Γ3 ∈ S with Γ1, Γ2 ⊂ Γ3.\r
Definition 2.1.7 A system of graphs S is called dense if there for every\r
point m ∈ M exists a coordinate chart x = (x1, . . . , xn) around m such that\r
for all open subset U containing m in this coordinate chart there exists a\r
collection of edges e1, . . . , en ⊂ U belonging to graphs in S such that:\r
8

1. the ei\r
’s are straight lines with respect to the coordinate chart,\r
2. the tangent vectors of the ei’s are linearly independent.\r
The definition of dense might appear awkward. The main purpose of the\r
definition is to ensure proposition 2.2.4. Furthermore it is easy to check the\r
definition in the concrete examples we have in mind. Certainly the require\u0002ment of straight lines can be eased.\r
We will now give three examples of dense systems of graphs, which will\r
be important in the rest of the paper. These systems of graphs differ partic\u0002ularly in the size of their corresponding symmetry groups.\r
Example 1 Let Ss be the system of all graphs. This system is clearly\r
dense. The system is however not directed since we can have two simple paths\r
e1, e2 with infinitely many isolated intersection points. Hence for graphs\r
Γ1, Γ2, where e1 ∈ Γ1 and e2 ∈ Γ2, there does not exist a graphs Γ3 contain\u0002ing Γ1 and Γ2. The system Ss admits a natural action of the diffeomorphism\r
group Diff(M). The system Ss is the same as the piecewise immersed sys\u0002tem defined in [11].\r
Example 2 Let M be a real analytic manifold. Let Sa be the system of\r
graph made up of real analytic simple curves. This system is dense and it\r
is also directed since piecewise analytic curves have only finitely many iso\u0002lated intersection points. The system carries a natural action of the group\r
Diffa(M) of real analytic diffeomorphism, but no action of the full diffeo\u0002morphism group Diff(M). This system was, in a base pointed version, first\r
considered in [4].\r
Example 3 Let T be a triangulation of M. We let Γ0 be the graph\r
consisting of all the edges in this triangulation. Strictly speaking this is not\r
a graph if the manifold in not compact, but in this case we can consider\r
Γ0 as a system of graphs instead. Let Tn be the triangulation obtained by\r
barycentric subdividing each of the simplices in T n times. The graph Γn is\r
the graph consisting of the edges of Tn. In this way we get a directed and\r
dense system S△ = {Γn} of graphs.\r
The important feature of S△ which we are going to use in this paper is\r
the following: The step from Γn to Γn+1 involves:\r

M\r
Γ1\r
M\r
Γ2\r
...\r
Figure 1:\r
1. new edges are added\r
2. the edges of Γn get subdivided into two edges.\r
The system S△ only admits an action of the diffeomorphisms Diff(△)\r
that maps edges in ∪Tn to edges in ∪Tn. Hence this is a much more restrictive\r
class of diffeomorphism than in the first two examples. Contrary to the first\r
two examples, the system S△ is countable.\r
Definition 2.1.8 Let S be a directed system of graphs. We define the hoop\r
groupoid HG(S) of S to be the inductive limit\r

j,k are real and non zero for all j, k. Then D is self adjoint.\r
Proof. We will prove that Dn is formally self adjoint for each n. From this\r
the statement follows because Dn is an elliptic pseudo differential operator\r
on a compact manifold and therefore by elliptic regularity Dn is self adjoint.\r
We can even find an orthonormal basis for H′\r
n which diagonalizes Dn with\r
real eigenvalues. We can therefore find an orthonormal basis for H′ which\r
diagonalizes D with real eigenvalues. Hence D is self adjoint.\r

P\r
∗\r
n,n+1(Dn,p(ξ)) = Dn+1,p(ξ),\r
and therefore {Dn,p} defines a densely defined self adjoint operator Dp on H.\r
Since D is affiliated with N by corollary 4.4.2, so is Dp by construction.\r
Theorem 4.5.1 There exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and {bk} such that (Bv, H, Dp)\r
is a semifinite spectral triple with respect to (N , τ ).\r
Proof. The selfadjointness and affiliation to N of Dp are already taken\r
care of. What remains is to prove that [b, Dp] ∈ B(H) and that b(λ−Dp)\r
−1 ∈\r
Kτ for all b ∈ Bv.\r

Hn = L\r
2\r
(G\r

the loop operator L acts by point wise matrix multiplication over G2\r
n\r
in\r
the MN factor, i.e. the matrix entries is of the form f(g1, . . . , g2n ). The\r
action of L on Hn+1 is then matrix multiplication with entries of the form\r
f(g1g2, . . . , g2n+1−1g2n+1 ). Conjugating the operator with Θn+1 we see, since\r
Θ\r
−1\r
n+1(g1, . . . , g2n+1 ) = (g1g\r

2\r
, g2g\r
−1\r
3\r
, . . . , g2n−1g\r
−1\r
2n+1 , g2n+1),\r
that the result is independent of g2, g4, . . . , g2n+1, and thus [L, D−\r
n+1] = 0.\r
It therefore follows that [L, Pn+1] = 0. Hence [L, Dn+1,p] = [L, Dn,p] and\r
therefore [L, Dp] is bounded.\r
To prove that there exist sequences {a\r
j,k} and bj such Dp has τ -compact\r
resolvent we will prove that for any real sequence cn converging to ∞ we can\r
choose a\r
n,k and bn such that the new eigenvalues, modulo the extra multi\u0002plicity of the existing eigenvalue due to the growth of the Clifford bundle,\r
introduced by going from (Dn−1,p)\r
