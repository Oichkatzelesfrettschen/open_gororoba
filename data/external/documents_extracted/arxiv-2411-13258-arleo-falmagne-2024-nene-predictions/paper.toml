The universal dependence of hadron suppression, 𝑅AA(𝑝⊥), observed at large-𝑝⊥ in heavy ion\r
collisions at RHIC and LHC allows for a systematic determination of the average parton energy loss\r
⟨𝜖⟩ in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). A simple relation between ⟨𝜖⟩ and the soft particle multiplicity\r
allows for probing the dependence of parton energy loss on the medium path-length. We find\r
that all the available measurements are consistent with ⟨𝜖⟩ ∝ 𝐿\r
𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02±\r
0.09\r
0.06, consistent\r
with the pQCD expectation of parton energy loss in a longitudinally expanding QGP. We then\r
show, based on the model predictions, that the data on the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient divided\r
by the collision eccentricity, 𝑣2/e, follows the same scaling property as 𝑅AA. Finally, a linear\r
relationship between 𝑣2/e and the logarithmic derivative of 𝑅AA at large 𝑝⊥ offers a purely data\u0002driven access to the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss. Quite remarkably, both hadron and jet\r
measurements obey this latter relationship, moreover with consistent values of 𝛽. This points to\r
the same parametric path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in QGP.\r

Path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss from universal scaling laws François Arleo\r
The theory of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its associated jet quenching\r
phenomenology in heavy ion collisions has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by\r
precise measurements from RHIC and LHC. Despite these advancements, fundamental questions\r
remain, such as how parton energy loss in QGP depends on the medium path-length 𝐿. In these\r
proceedings, we discuss how this question can be addressed through a data-driven strategy. More\r
specifically, we will exploit the scaling properties of large-𝑝⊥hadron spectra in heavy ion collisions,\r
predicted by a simple analytic energy loss model and observed in experimental data. In addition, we\r
show that jet measurements obey one such scaling law, offering the possibility to study jet energy\r
loss in QGP within the same strategy.\r
As discussed in Refs. [1, 2], the quenching of hadron spectra, 𝑅AA(𝑝⊥), exhibits at large 𝑝⊥a\r
universal shape as a function of 𝑝⊥:\r
𝑅\r
ℎ\r
AA(𝑝⊥\r

Here, 𝑛 represents the spectral index of the hadron 𝑝⊥spectrum in pp collisions, d𝜎\r
ℎ\r
pp/d𝑝⊥ ∝ 𝑝\r
−𝑛\r
⊥\r
,\r
and 𝜖¯ denotes a characteristic energy loss scale reflecting the properties of the medium produced in\r
a given collision system. Fits to the quenching of hadron spectra, measured in heavy ion collisions\r
at RHIC (AuAu collisions) and LHC (XeXe, PbPb), allow for a systematic extraction of the scales\r
𝜖¯ across a broad range of collision energies √\r
𝑠 and centrality classes C, as illustrated in Fig. 1 (see\r
Ref. [2] for more details and for the bibliographical references therein to the data sets).\r
In order to go a step further, it is instructive to relate the 𝜖¯ to the relevant physical quantities in\r
heavy ion collisions. In the BDMPS formalism, 𝜖¯ should scale according to [2]\r

Path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss from universal scaling laws François Arleo\r
Since the values of ⟨𝑧⟩ and 𝐶𝑘 may differ for heavy hadrons, the analysis will focus on light hadrons\r
from now on. The parameter 𝛼 entering (2) characterizes the dynamical expansion of the medium,\r
according to 𝑞ˆ(𝜏) = 𝑞ˆ0 (𝜏0/𝜏)\r
𝛼\r
. The initial transport coefficient 𝑞ˆ0 = 𝑞ˆ(𝜏0) is proportional to the\r
initial parton density 𝑛0, which in the Bjorken picture can be estimated as\r

with 𝛽 = 2 − 𝛼. The geometric quantities 𝐴⊥ and 𝐿 entering Eq. (4) are determined through an\r
optical Glauber model, assuming hard sphere nuclear densities. The charged particle multiplicity\r
data d𝑁ch/d𝜂 at mid-rapidity is taken from PHENIX at RHIC and from ALICE and CMS at LHC\r
(see [2] and references therein). The energy loss scales 𝜖¯ extracted from the quenching of light\r
hadrons are fitted using Eq. (4), with 𝛽 (and 𝐾) taken as a free parameter.\r
As can be seen in Figure 2, the scaling property expected from Eq. (4) holds very well for light\r
hadron production in all collision systems. The fits leads to 𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r
−0.06 (𝜒\r

Once the dependence of 𝜖¯ with 𝐿 is empirically determined, it becomes possible to investigate\r
the azimuthal dependence of hadron suppression, from which the 𝑣2 coefficient can be computed.\r
Using the universal shape of 𝑅AA, its 𝜙 dependence can be modeled as\r

of the impact parameter), approximated as 𝐿(𝜙) = 𝐿 × (1 − e cos (2𝜙)), where the eccentricity is\r
defined as e = (𝐿(𝜋/2) − 𝐿(0)) /(𝐿(𝜋/2) + 𝐿(0)). To first order in e and using Eq. (5), the elliptic\r

Eq. (6) indicates that 𝑣2/e at large 𝑝⊥should exhibit the same approximate universal dependence\r
on 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯ as 𝑅AA, for all collision energies and centrality classes. In order to check this prediction,\r
𝑅AA(𝑝⊥, 𝜙) has been computed in each collision system, using our full model including Glauber\r
simulations; this is then fitted to extract 𝑣2 values. The model predictions using the 𝛽 value fitted in\r
Fig. 2 (grey band) and the CMS measurements of 𝑣2 in PbPb collisions [3, 4] are plotted together\r
in Fig. 3 as a function of the scaling variable 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯, where the values of 𝜖¯ are determined from the\r
fits of 𝑅AA (see Fig. 1). The predicted scaling for the different collision systems is clearly apparent\r
in the data, except at the lowest values of 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯. The simultaneous calculation of 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 in\r
the model and its agreement with measurements of both observables is thus compelling – moreover\r
with a path-length dependence compatible with perturbative QCD. In addition, Eq. (7) indicates\r
that 𝑣2 and 𝑅AA at a given 𝑝⊥are trivially related for measurements from the same collision system.\r
In particular, this relation does not involve the knowledge of the energy loss scale 𝜖¯ nor that of the\r
function 𝑓 appearing in (6). It is also worth noting that the normalization uncertainties of 𝑅AA\r
vanish when computing (7). We would like to check whether it also holds when comparing solely\r
𝑅AA and 𝑣2 measurements, independently of the present energy loss model. The 𝑣2/e measurements\r
are plotted as a function of the slope d ln 𝑅AA/d ln 𝑝⊥in Fig. 4 (left). The slope is evaluated with\r
an agnostic fit of CMS 𝑅AA data [5, 6]; when the centrality classes for 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 did not match,\r
values for combined classes have been interpolated with weights scaling with 𝑁coll.\r
Although the present precision of the data does not allow yet for a rigorous test of Eq. (7),\r
the correlation between the two measured quantities is clearly apparent (correlation coefficient\r
𝜌 = 0.78). In addition, a fit with the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 reproduces fairly the hadron\r
observations, resulting in a value 𝛽 = 0.94 ± 0.04 (fit uncertainties only) consistent with the value\r
𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r
−0.06 extracted from the scaling with hadron multiplicity, Eq. (4). This gives confidence\r
that the relation between 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 at large 𝑝⊥indeed provides a direct experimental access to\r
the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in QGP. A possible explanation for the slight\r
overshoot in the 50–60% centrality class may be back-to-back jet correlations contamination in\r
data [6]. In other centrality classes, disagreement may be due to the overestimation of e in the\r
Glauber model presently used, which relies on hard sphere nuclear densities.\r
Although related in principle, hadron and jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are likely\r
to probe different aspects of medium-induced gluon radiation. The former appears as a good proxy\r
of genuine parton energy loss in QGP, the latter probes instead gluon emission off a final state\r
made of multiple particles acting coherently. Consequently, there is no reason a priori that parton\r
and jet energy loss exhibit the same energy and path-length parametric dependence, nor the 𝑝⊥\r

dependence of 𝑅AA of both processes to be identical.1 It is therefore worthwhile to investigate\r
whether the relation (7) between 𝑅AA and 𝑣2, derived on rather general grounds, also applies to jet\r
production – despite the different 𝑝⊥-dependence of 𝑅AA – and, if so, to determine which value of\r
𝛽 best matches the data.\r
The results, using 𝑅AA [7] and 𝑣2 [8] ATLAS data in PbPb collisions at √\r
𝑠 = 5.02 TeV, are\r
shown in Fig. 4 (right). As for hadrons, the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 fits well the data2, with\r
a value 𝛽jets = 1.03 ± 0.06 which is consistent with the value extracted from Eq. (4) for light\r
hadrons. This is a remarkable indication that parton and jet energy loss share the same parametric,\r
close-to-linear, dependence on the medium path-length. It is also interesting to note that a different\r
path-length dependence of jet energy loss, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
0.59, is obtained in the data-driven approach of\r
Ref. [11], while other studies point instead towards a stronger dependence on 𝐿, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
1.4\r
[12]\r
and Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
2\r
[10].\r
In summary, relating the values of 𝜖¯ extracted from 𝑅AA to the hadron multiplicity enables the\r
determination of the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss, 𝜖¯ ∝ 𝐿\r
𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r
−0.06, in agreement\r
with a longitudinally expanding QGP. The 𝑣2/e anisotropy coefficient exhibits the same scaling\r
property as 𝑅AA, in both the model and data. Finally we highlight a relation between 𝑣2/e and\r
𝑅AA, predicted in the model and observed in data, which allows for a data-driven extraction of the\r
path-length dependence of parton energy loss. We find that jet data obey the same relation, pointing\r
to a similar path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in quark-gluon plasma. The LHC\r
Runs 3 & 4 should allow for testing with unprecedented precision these scaling properties.\r
1The 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 of jets have also been discussed at this conference, see Ref. [9, 10] for details.\r
2The centrality class 0–5% for hadrons and 0–10% for jets have not been included as the small eccentricity results in\r
large uncertainties on 𝑣2/e; in addition, the eccentricity in central collisions depends on density fluctuations that cannot\r
be accounted for in the optical Glauber model we use to compute it.\r

The universal dependence of hadron suppression, 𝑅AA(𝑝⊥), observed at large-𝑝⊥ in heavy ion\r
collisions at RHIC and LHC allows for a systematic determination of the average parton energy loss\r
⟨𝜖⟩ in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). A simple relation between ⟨𝜖⟩ and the soft particle multiplicity\r
allows for probing the dependence of parton energy loss on the medium path-length. We find\r
that all the available measurements are consistent with ⟨𝜖⟩ ∝ 𝐿\r
𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02±\r
0.09\r
0.06, consistent\r
with the pQCD expectation of parton energy loss in a longitudinally expanding QGP. We then\r
show, based on the model predictions, that the data on the azimuthal anisotropy coefficient divided\r
by the collision eccentricity, 𝑣2/e, follows the same scaling property as 𝑅AA. Finally, a linear\r
relationship between 𝑣2/e and the logarithmic derivative of 𝑅AA at large 𝑝⊥ offers a purely data\u0002driven access to the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss. Quite remarkably, both hadron and jet\r
measurements obey this latter relationship, moreover with consistent values of 𝛽. This points to\r
the same parametric path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in QGP.\r

Path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss from universal scaling laws François Arleo\r
The theory of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and its associated jet quenching\r
phenomenology in heavy ion collisions has evolved significantly over the past decade, driven by\r
precise measurements from RHIC and LHC. Despite these advancements, fundamental questions\r
remain, such as how parton energy loss in QGP depends on the medium path-length 𝐿. In these\r
proceedings, we discuss how this question can be addressed through a data-driven strategy. More\r
specifically, we will exploit the scaling properties of large-𝑝⊥hadron spectra in heavy ion collisions,\r
predicted by a simple analytic energy loss model and observed in experimental data. In addition, we\r
show that jet measurements obey one such scaling law, offering the possibility to study jet energy\r
loss in QGP within the same strategy.\r
As discussed in Refs. [1, 2], the quenching of hadron spectra, 𝑅AA(𝑝⊥), exhibits at large 𝑝⊥a\r
universal shape as a function of 𝑝⊥:\r

Since the values of ⟨𝑧⟩ and 𝐶𝑘 may differ for heavy hadrons, the analysis will focus on light hadrons\r
from now on. The parameter 𝛼 entering (2) characterizes the dynamical expansion of the medium,\r
according to 𝑞ˆ(𝜏) = 𝑞ˆ0 (𝜏0/𝜏)\r

(see [2] and references therein). The energy loss scales 𝜖¯ extracted from the quenching of light\r
hadrons are fitted using Eq. (4), with 𝛽 (and 𝐾) taken as a free parameter.\r
As can be seen in Figure 2, the scaling property expected from Eq. (4) holds very well for light\r
hadron production in all collision systems. The fits leads to 𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r

Once the dependence of 𝜖¯ with 𝐿 is empirically determined, it becomes possible to investigate\r

of the impact parameter), approximated as 𝐿(𝜙) = 𝐿 × (1 − e cos (2𝜙)), where the eccentricity is\r
defined as e = (𝐿(𝜋/2) − 𝐿(0)) /(𝐿(𝜋/2) + 𝐿(0)). To first order in e and using Eq. (5), the elliptic\r

Eq. (6) indicates that 𝑣2/e at large 𝑝⊥should exhibit the same approximate universal dependence\r
on 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯ as 𝑅AA, for all collision energies and centrality classes. In order to check this prediction,\r
𝑅AA(𝑝⊥, 𝜙) has been computed in each collision system, using our full model including Glauber\r
simulations; this is then fitted to extract 𝑣2 values. The model predictions using the 𝛽 value fitted in\r
Fig. 2 (grey band) and the CMS measurements of 𝑣2 in PbPb collisions [3, 4] are plotted together\r
in Fig. 3 as a function of the scaling variable 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯, where the values of 𝜖¯ are determined from the\r
fits of 𝑅AA (see Fig. 1). The predicted scaling for the different collision systems is clearly apparent\r
in the data, except at the lowest values of 𝑝⊥/𝑛𝜖¯. The simultaneous calculation of 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 in\r
the model and its agreement with measurements of both observables is thus compelling – moreover\r
with a path-length dependence compatible with perturbative QCD. In addition, Eq. (7) indicates\r
that 𝑣2 and 𝑅AA at a given 𝑝⊥are trivially related for measurements from the same collision system.\r
In particular, this relation does not involve the knowledge of the energy loss scale 𝜖¯ nor that of the\r
function 𝑓 appearing in (6). It is also worth noting that the normalization uncertainties of 𝑅AA\r
vanish when computing (7). We would like to check whether it also holds when comparing solely\r
𝑅AA and 𝑣2 measurements, independently of the present energy loss model. The 𝑣2/e measurements\r
are plotted as a function of the slope d ln 𝑅AA/d ln 𝑝⊥in Fig. 4 (left). The slope is evaluated with\r
an agnostic fit of CMS 𝑅AA data [5, 6]; when the centrality classes for 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 did not match,\r
values for combined classes have been interpolated with weights scaling with 𝑁coll.\r
Although the present precision of the data does not allow yet for a rigorous test of Eq. (7),\r
the correlation between the two measured quantities is clearly apparent (correlation coefficient\r
𝜌 = 0.78). In addition, a fit with the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 reproduces fairly the hadron\r
observations, resulting in a value 𝛽 = 0.94 ± 0.04 (fit uncertainties only) consistent with the value\r
𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r
−0.06 extracted from the scaling with hadron multiplicity, Eq. (4). This gives confidence\r
that the relation between 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 at large 𝑝⊥indeed provides a direct experimental access to\r
the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in QGP. A possible explanation for the slight\r
overshoot in the 50–60% centrality class may be back-to-back jet correlations contamination in\r
data [6]. In other centrality classes, disagreement may be due to the overestimation of e in the\r
Glauber model presently used, which relies on hard sphere nuclear densities.\r
Although related in principle, hadron and jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are likely\r
to probe different aspects of medium-induced gluon radiation. The former appears as a good proxy\r
of genuine parton energy loss in QGP, the latter probes instead gluon emission off a final state\r
made of multiple particles acting coherently. Consequently, there is no reason a priori that parton\r
and jet energy loss exhibit the same energy and path-length parametric dependence, nor the 𝑝⊥\r

dependence of 𝑅AA of both processes to be identical.1 It is therefore worthwhile to investigate\r
whether the relation (7) between 𝑅AA and 𝑣2, derived on rather general grounds, also applies to jet\r
production – despite the different 𝑝⊥-dependence of 𝑅AA – and, if so, to determine which value of\r
𝛽 best matches the data.\r
The results, using 𝑅AA [7] and 𝑣2 [8] ATLAS data in PbPb collisions at √\r
𝑠 = 5.02 TeV, are\r
shown in Fig. 4 (right). As for hadrons, the expected function 𝑦 = 𝛽 𝑥/2 fits well the data2, with\r
a value 𝛽jets = 1.03 ± 0.06 which is consistent with the value extracted from Eq. (4) for light\r
hadrons. This is a remarkable indication that parton and jet energy loss share the same parametric,\r
close-to-linear, dependence on the medium path-length. It is also interesting to note that a different\r
path-length dependence of jet energy loss, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
0.59, is obtained in the data-driven approach of\r
Ref. [11], while other studies point instead towards a stronger dependence on 𝐿, Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
1.4\r
[12]\r
and Δ𝐸 ∝ 𝐿\r
2\r
[10].\r
In summary, relating the values of 𝜖¯ extracted from 𝑅AA to the hadron multiplicity enables the\r
determination of the 𝐿 dependence of parton energy loss, 𝜖¯ ∝ 𝐿\r
𝛽 with 𝛽 = 1.02+0.09\r
−0.06, in agreement\r
with a longitudinally expanding QGP. The 𝑣2/e anisotropy coefficient exhibits the same scaling\r
property as 𝑅AA, in both the model and data. Finally we highlight a relation between 𝑣2/e and\r
𝑅AA, predicted in the model and observed in data, which allows for a data-driven extraction of the\r
path-length dependence of parton energy loss. We find that jet data obey the same relation, pointing\r
to a similar path-length dependence of parton and jet energy loss in quark-gluon plasma. The LHC\r
Runs 3 & 4 should allow for testing with unprecedented precision these scaling properties.\r
1The 𝑅AA and 𝑣2 of jets have also been discussed at this conference, see Ref. [9, 10] for details.\r
2The centrality class 0–5% for hadrons and 0–10% for jets have not been included as the small eccentricity results in\r
large uncertainties on 𝑣2/e; in addition, the eccentricity in central collisions depends on density fluctuations that cannot\r
be accounted for in the optical Glauber model we use to compute it.\r
