Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and\r
long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of\r
the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task\r
involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrodinger equations in the canonical quantization ¨\r
picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time\r
evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of\r
iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths\r
where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal\r
the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length\r
against the virtual bond dimension χ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two\r
scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but\r
were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge\r
c = 1, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of\r
three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at\r
the dividing point. Our work uncovers the scaling behaviors of EE in the continuous-space quantum many-body\r
systems. These results provide solid numerical evidence supporting the high efficiency of TN in representing\r
the continuous-space quantum many-body wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit, and meanwhile suggest\r
an efficient approach to study the entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Developing efficient approaches for simulating strongly\u0002correlated quantum systems is a long-standing topic of inter\u0002est. A well-established treatment is lattice approximation that\r
leads to quantum lattice models such as Heisenberg and Hub\u0002bard models, where tensor network (TN) methods [1–4] have\r
been successfully adopted to reveal fruitful exotic phenom\u0002ena such as quantum criticality and quantum topological or\u0002ders [5–10]. The success of TN methods in simulating quan\u0002tum lattice models is solidly supported by the scaling theo\u0002ries of entanglement entropy (EE) [11–17]. For instance, ma\u0002trix product state (MPS) [18, 19] can faithfully represent the\r
states satisfying one-dimensional (1D) area law of EE, which\r
include the ground states of gapped 1D Hamiltonians with lo\u0002cal couplings [12, 20, 21]. For 1D critical quantum lattice\r
models, the criticality (such as central charge) can be accu\u0002rately accessed by the scaling behaviors of MPS [11–13, 17].\r
Without lattice approximation, the main challenge lies in\r
solving the many-body Schrodinger equations, which are ¨\r
multi-variable partial differential equations (PDE’s). Analyt\u0002ical solutions are nearly infeasible. Numerical methods, such\r
as Monte Carlo [22–25] and neural-network schemes [26–\r
30], are severely hindered by the so-called “exponential wall”,\r
namely the complexity (say the dimension of sampling space)\r
scales exponentially with the system size. Meanwhile, theo\u0002ries and methods established for quantum lattice models, such\r
as EE and its scaling laws, can hardly be applied to the quan-\r

cases for K > 2.\r
tum models in continuous space. These severely hinder the in\u0002vestigation of the realistic quantum systems such as the quan\u0002tum materials with strong correlations.\r
In this work, we extend the TN-based imaginary-time evo\u0002lution algorithms for quantum lattice models [31, 32] to the\r
simulation of continuous-space quantum many-body systems\r
by incorporating the continuous-space TN method [33, 34]

2\r
(see Fig. 1). We here adopt the translationally-invariant\r
MPS to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation (in ¨\r
the canonical quantization form) of infinitely-many coupled\r
quantum oscillators (iCQOs). This Schrodinger equation con- ¨\r
sists of a set of PDE’s with infinitely-many variables. No nu\u0002merical results of solving these PDE’s were reported to our\r
best knowledge, due to the infinite number of variables in\u0002volved. One may refer to Refs. [35–37] on solving PDE’s with\r
finite variables by MPS. The translationally-invariant MPS is\r
used to represent the infinitely-many coefficients of the wave\u0002function in a set of orthonormal functional bases.\r
By leveraging the advantages of canonical MPS [31] on ef\u0002ficiently simulating entanglement and correlations of quantum\r
many-body states, we investigate the criticality of iCQOs with\r
the presence of two- and three-body coupling terms. With\r
just the two-body terms, we determine the range of coupling\r
strength where there exists a physical ground-state solution\r
(i.e., real ground-state energy as the Hamiltonian is hermi\u0002tian [38]), which we dub as physical region. At the divid\u0002ing point between the physical and non-physical regions, we\r
uncover that the ground-state EE and correlation length sat\u0002isfy the critical scaling laws (against the virtual dimension of\r
MPS), which were previously uncovered in the critical quan\u0002tum lattice models [11, 13, 16, 39]. The scaling coefficients\r
result in a central charge c = 1 [40, 41], indicating that the\r
ground state of iCQOs can be described by free boson confor\u0002mal field theory (CFT) [42]. With three-body couplings, we\r
show the breakdown of CFT even with very weak three-body\r
couplings. Our work explicitly shows the satisfaction of the\r
1D scaling laws of EE, which can serve as solid supports on\r
MPS as an efficient ansatz to represent the ground-state wave\u0002functions of continuous-space many-body systems, including\r
those in the thermodynamic limit.\r
II. IMAGINARY-TIME EVOLUTION FOR THE\r
GROUND-STATE SIMULATION OF INFINITELY-MANY\r
COUPLED QUANTUM OSCILLATORS\r
To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body sys\u0002tems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is a\r
normalized many-variable function denoted as ψ(x) with x =\r
(x1, x2, . . .), in a set of complete functional bases {ϕsn(xn)}.\r
A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which are exponen\u0002tially many, in an MPS whose complexity scales just linearly\r
with the system size (i.e., number of variables) [33, 34]. The\r
infinite functional MPS is written as\r
ψ(x) = tTr \u0012 Y∞\r
n=1\r

\u0013\r
,(1)\r
with tTr the summation of all shared indexes. We take\r
the Planck constant ℏ = 1 for simplicity. We here\r
choose the functional bases to be “local”, i.e., constructed\r
by the single-variable functions {ϕsn(xn)} that satisfy\r
R ∞\r
−∞ ϕ\r
∗\r
s\r
(x)ϕs\r
′ (x)dx = δss′ . The physical dimension (the\r
bond dimension of physical index sn, denoted as D) deter\u0002mines the order of expansion, namely dim(sn) in {ϕsn\r
(xn)}.\r
The virtual dimension (the dimension of virtual index an, de\u0002noted as χ) determines the number of expansion terms. Both\r
dimensions determine the parameter complexity of the MPS.\r
To efficiently represent the infinite-size wave-functions, we\r
take the MPS to be translationally invariant. Fig. 1 illustrates\r
the MPS satisfying the “two-tensor” translational invariance,\r
namely the MPS is formed by infinitely-many copies of two\r
inequivalent tensors A and B, as well as those of two inequiv\u0002alent spectra (diagonal matrices) λ\r
I\r
and λ\r
II [Fig. 1(a)]. The\r
spectra are necessary to define the canonical form of infinite\r
MPS for the purpose of optimal truncations and entanglement\r
simulations [31]. The number of variational parameters in\r
such an MPS scales approximately as O(Dχ2). In practice,\r
we adopt the “K-tensor” translational invariance. We take\r
K = 2 when there exist only the one- and two-body terms in\r
the Hamiltonian, and K = 6 with the presence of the three\u0002body terms.\r
Translational invariance allows TN methods to efficiently\r
simulate infinite-size quantum many-body systems. For quan\u0002tum lattice models, translational invariance explicitly corre\u0002sponds to the translational invariance of the quantum states\r
with the respect to lattice sites, since the tensors are usually\r
in one-to-one correspondence with the sites. For continuous\u0002space systems (such as iCQOs considered here), there is\r
no such correspondences. The translational invariance re\u0002spects the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, and is not contra\u0002dictory to the indistinguishability of particles. Thus, we re\u0002gard translational invariance as a physically-reasonable con\u0002jecture imposed on the functional MPS ansatz. Note that the\r
Schrodinger equations we aim to solve are in the canonical ¨\r
quantization picture, where the bosonic or fermionic statistics\r
of the wave-functions is not explicitly considered.\r
The Hamiltonian of iCQOs is written as\r
Hˆ = −\r
1\r

X∞\r
n=1\r

) + γ\r
X∞\r
n=1\r
xnxn+1, (2)\r
where we take the natural frequency ω = 1 for simplicity. The\r
time-independent Schrodinger equation reads ¨ Hˆ |ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩,\r
which is a set of PDE’s consisting of infinitely-many vari\u0002ables {xn}. The minimal eigenvalue (denoted as E0) gives\r
the ground-state energy, satisfying E0 = min|ψ⟩⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩ =\r
⟨ψ0|Hˆ |ψ0⟩ with |ψ0⟩ denoting the ground state.\r
Given a set of orthonormal functional bases {ϕs(xn)}, the\r
operators (say ∂\r
∂xn\r
and xn) can be represented as matrices\r
(denoted as ∂ˆ\r
n and Xˆn). Their coefficients satisfy ∂ss R\r

be found in the Supplemental Material [43].\r
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS OF CRITICAL SCALING\r
LAWS\r
The ground-state energy of iCQOs with two-body cou\u0002plings [Eq. (2)] can be analytically obtained [38], which sat\u0002isfies\r

Eexact is real for γ <= γc ≡ 0.5, which we dub as the physical\r
region. Fig. 2 shows the error ε = |Eexact − ⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩| versus\r
the physical and virtual dimensions (D and χ). The error con\u0002verges to ε ∼ O(10−5\r
), indicating that the ground states can\r
be well approximated by the MPS’s with a finite D or χ.\r
The correlation length ξ and entanglement entropy (EE) S\r
of the ground state can be efficiently accessed by the MPS\r
method [4, 44]. The correlation length is obtained from the\r
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix M of the infinite MPS [see\r
the inset of Fig. 3(a) for the illustration of M], satisfying\r
ξ =\r
1\r
ln Λ0−ln Λ1\r
with Λ0 and Λ1 the two dominant eigen\u0002values of M. It naturally obeys the standard definition of\r
correlation length of continuous-space wave-functions, which\r
characterizes the decay of correlation function ⟨Oˆ\r
nOˆn′ ⟩ ver\u0002sus |n − n\r
′\r
|. The EE of continuous-space wave-functions is\r
much less investigated. Here, the canonical form of the infi\u0002nite MPS gives us a well-defined entanglement spectrum. The\r
EE can then be defined as S = −2\r

2\r
ln λ\r
I(II)\r
a . The\r
difference between the EE’s calculated from the two spectra\r
is about O(10−3), which is the result of numerical errors.\r
When γ is far away from the dividing point γ = 0.5, both\r
the correlation length ξ and EE S converge as χ increases\r
(Fig. 3). We fix D = 16, which should be sufficiently large.\r
FIG. 3. (Color online) (a) The correlation length ξ and (b) EE S\r
versus the virtual bond dimension χ. We vary the strength of the\r
two-body interaction from γ = 0.49 to 0.5 by fixing D = 16. The\r
correlation length is computed using the transfer matrix of the infi\u0002nite MPS illustrated in the inset of (a). The inset of (b) shows the\r
convergence of central charge c → 1 against χmax (meaning the fit\u0002ting is implemented with the data for χ ≤ χmax). Fittings of ξ and S\r
are given by the dashed lines, which obey algebraic and logarithmic\r
scaling laws, respectively [see Eqs. (4) and (5)].\r
These results indicate the finiteness of correlation length and\r
EE for the ground state of iCQOs within the physical region,\r
which are typical signatures of a finite excitation gap. This\r
suggests that an infinite functional MPS with finite bond di\u0002mensions can well approximate such non-critical many-body\r
wave-functions.\r
As γ approaches the dividing point, both ξ and S become\r
asymptotically divergent (Fig. 3). At γ = 0.5, our results\r
suggest the algebraic scaling law of correlation length as\r
ξ ∼ χ\r
κ\r
, (4)\r
and meanwhile the logarithmic scaling law of EE as\r
S ∼ η ln χ. (5)\r
We have κ ≃ 1.32 and η ≃ 0.23. These two scaling laws\r
are recognized as signatures of criticality for quantum lattice\r
models [13], but haven’t been uncovered in the continuous\u0002space systems such as iCQOs. Our work reveals that even\r
with divergent correlation length and EE, the continuous\u0002space wave-functions can still be asymptotically approached\r
by MPS in a similar manner for approaching the critical quan\u0002tum lattice systems.\r
The critical properties can be further characterized by the\r
scaling coefficients. From CFT, we can estimate the central\r
charge as\r
c =\r
6η\r
κ\r
= 1 + O(10−2). (6)\r
This suggests the wave-function at the dividing point between\r
the physical and non-physical regions to be described by the\r
c = 1 boson CFT [42]. The inset of Fig. 3(b) demonstrates\r
the convergence of c versus χ.

with E = ⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩. In the non-physical region, the obtained\r
energy is irregularly low with the violation L ∼ O(102)\r
(which is far larger than the violation L ∼ O(10−1) in the\r
physical region). By fitting, we find the dividing boundary to\r
satisfy an algebraic relation γ˜ ∼ (0.5 − γ)\r
0.438\r
.\r
Fig. 5(a) shows that EE slightly increases when γ˜ ap\u0002proaches the dividing boundary from the physical side. The\r
dividing boundary given by the peak of EE is consistent with\r
that obtained in Fig. 4. We have γ˜ = 0.02 ± O(10−5) as the\r
dividing point for γ = 0.499, and γ˜ = 0.035 ± O(10−5) for\r
γ = 0.495. On the dividing boundary, our results show that\r
EE no longer obeys the logarithmic scaling law but converges\r
after χ ≃ 25 for γ = 0.499 (or after χ ≃ 15 for γ = 0.495).\r
See Fig. 5(b). EE does not scale to diverge as χ increases,\r
and thus implies the absence of criticality or the CFT descrip\u0002tion for the ground-state wave-functions when the three-body\r
terms appear.\r
V. SUMMARY\r
This work concerns simulating the ground-state wave\u0002functions and their entanglement properties of infinite-size\r
quantum many-body systems in continuous space. We com\u0002bine the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm\r
with functional tensor network (TN) to simulate the ground\r
states of infinite coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs) defined\r
in continuous space. At the dividing point between the phys\u0002ical and non-physical regions with just two-body couplings,\r

we reveal algebraic scaling laws of the correlation length and\r
logarithmic scaling laws of the entanglement entropy (EE)\r
against the virtual dimension of the TN ansatz. These findings\r
suggest the c = 1 boson conformal field theory (CFT) describ\u0002ing the criticality at the dividing point. We further show that\r
the three-body terms break down the criticality and the CFT\r
description on the dividing boundary. Our work demonstrates\r
the validity of EE scaling theories based on TN for investi\u0002gating the quantum many-body systems in continuous space.\r
The satisfactions of EE scaling laws serves as a solid evidence\r
on the efficiency of TN for approximating continuous-space\r
wave-functions and for accessing the properties of criticality\r
of continuous-space quantum many-body systems.\r

Appendix A: Functional matrix product state and operators\r
To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body sys\u0002tems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is\r
a normalized many-variable function denoted as ψ(x) with

5\r
x = (x1, x2, . . .), in a set of orthonormal functional bases\r
{ϕsn(xn)}. A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which\r
are exponentially many, in a tensor network (TN) whose com\u0002plexity scales just polynomially with the system size [33, 34].\r
Here, we take the matrix product state (MPS), where the\r
many-body wave-function can be expressed as\r
ψ(x) =\r
D−\r
X\r
1\r
s1···sN =0\r
Cs1···sN ϕs1\r
(x1)· · · ϕsN (xN ). (A1)\r
Below, we adopt the infinite MPS, which is a simple but\r
powerful TN to represent infinite-size quantum states. To rep\u0002resent many-body wave-functions in the continuous space, the\r
infinite functional MPS can be written as\r
ψ(x) = tTr \u0012 Y∞\r

with tTr denoting the summation over all shared indexes.\r
The indexes αn (n = 1, · · · , N − 1) are dubbed as vir\u0002tual bonds. The upper bound of their dimensions dim(αn)\r
is called the virtual bond dimension, denoted by χ. The in\u0002dexes {sn} are called the physical bonds, with their dimen\u0002sions called the physical bond dimension , denoted by D. In\r
our cases for representing continuous-space wave-functions,\r
D determines the expansion order in the functional bases. The\r
number of parameters in the MPS (i.e., the total number of el\u0002ements in the tensors {A(n)} for n = 1, · · · , N) scales only\r
linearly with N as O(NDχ\r
2\r
), while the number of coeffi\u0002cients in ψ(x) scales exponentially as O(DN ).\r
The MPS is formed by infinite copies of four inequivalent\r
tensors, which are third-order tensors A, B, and vectors (or\r
diagonal matrices) λ\r
I\r
, λ\r
II. Such an MPS is called two-site\r
or two-tensor (considering A and B are defined on the sites)\r
translationally invariant.\r
To solve the Schrodinger equation for the ground state, we ¨\r
need to obtain the coefficients of operators in the same func\u0002tional bases. Considering an operator Oˆ(m) with respect to the\r
variable xm, acting it on ψ(x) yields\r

Appendix B: Infinite coupled quantum oscillators\r
We consider the infinitely coupled quantum oscillators (iC\u0002QOs) in one dimension as an example. The Hamiltonian reads\r

natural frequency ωn = 1. The strengths of the two- and\r
three-body coupling are denoted as γ and γ˜, respectively. We\r
also take the Planck constant to be ℏ = 1 for simplicity.\r
A natural choice for the orthonormal functional bases is the\r

Appendix C: Infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm\r
The ground state of a given Hamiltonian can be simulated\r
using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)\r
algorithm [32]. We start from the definition of the time\u0002evolution operator\r
Uˆ(τ ) = Y\r

evolution. See Eqs. (C3)-(C5).\r
with τ a small positive number representing a short time slice.\r
Note that Uˆ(τ ) is the product of infinitely-many copies of lo\u0002cal time-evolution operator Uˆ = e\r
−τHˆn,n+1 . The ground state\r
|ψ0⟩ can be approached by evolving an initial state |ψ0⟩ until\r
it converges, where we have\r
1\r
Z\r
lim\r
K→∞\r
(\r
Y\r
n\r
Uˆ(τ ))K = |ψ0⟩, (C2)\r
with Z the normalization factor. An illustration of the evolu\u0002tion is given in Fig. 6(a).\r
With the presence of three-body terms, we assume the MPS\r
to be 6-tensor translationally invariant, which is formed by\r
infinitely-many copies of 6 third-order tensors and 6 spectra\r
(diagonal matrices). The three-body evolution operator can\r
be readily defined to implement the imaginary-time evolution\r
with the presence of three-body coupling terms. Below, we\r
still take the simulation without three-body terms (γ˜ = 0) as\r
an example to explain the algorithm.\r
Similar to Eq. (A8), the local operators (copies of Uˆ) are\r
contracted with the local tensors in the MPS sequentially. For\r
instance, considering the contraction of Uˆ, A, B, and the rel\u0002evant spectra, we have\r

with Us0s1p0p1 = ⟨s0s1|Uˆ|p0p1⟩. See Fig. 1(b).\r
To restore the MPS form before contraction, we perform\r
SVD on T as\r
T [0,1],[2,3] = W λIIV\r
†\r
(C4)\r
with T [0,1],[2,3] being the matrization of T by reshaping its\r
first two indexes into one index and the rest two indices into\r
another. See the first line of Fig. 1(b). The spectrum λ\r
II is\r
updated by the singular spectrum obtained in the above SVD.

FIG. 7. (Color online) The canonical conditions of MPS. See\r
Eq. (D1) for the contraction formula corresponding to the left panel.\r
Obviously, the new indexes obtained by SVD and the new\r
spectrum λ\r
II possess a larger dimension. Without any trunca\u0002tion, the dimension will increase exponentially with the evo\u0002lution time. What we do in the iTEBD algorithm is if this\r
dimension exceeds the preset maximum (denoted as χ), it\r
should be truncated to χ by keeping only the χ-largest sin\u0002gular values and the corresponding singular vectors.\r
Finally, one restores the spectra located at the two sides by\r
inserting λ\r

Appendix D: Canonical form of matrix product state\r
With τ → 0, the evolution given by Uˆ(τ ) is close to be\r
identical. Therefore, the evolution drives the MPS to the\r
so-called canonical form [31], where the tensors satisfy the\r
canonical conditions illustrated in Fig. 7. As an example, the\r
contraction given by the left panel reads\r

with I representing the identity. The canonical conditions can\r
be generalized to the cases with K-tensor translational invari\u0002ance.\r
We here utilize two advantages of the MPS being in the\r
canonical form. First, the truncations implemented in the\r
iTEBD algorithm are (nearly) optimal. By “nearly”, we mean\r
that the MPS approaches (but is not in) the strict canonical\r
form in the nearly-identical evolution given by Uˆ(τ ). Sec\u0002ond, it has been proven that the spectra (λ\r
I\r
and λ\r
II) give the\r
entanglement spectra for the bipartitions at the corresponding\r
positions. These two advantages hold not only for MPS rep\u0002resenting the quantum many-body states of lattice models, but\r
also the functional MPS’s that represent the wave-functions in\r
the continuous space as well as for the functional MPS’s with\r
K-tensor translational invariance.\r
Appendix E: Simulation of local fidelity\r
Fig. 8 shows the convergence with the MPS’s of dif\u0002ferent translational symmetries. We consider the K-tensor\r
translationally invariant MPS’s with K = 2, 3, 4, 6 and\r
FIG. 8. (Color online) Local fidelity F from the fidelity f =\r
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2versus the evolution step n\r
with different translational invariances (K = 2, 3, 4, 6). F is cal\u0002culated as the norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer\r
matrix of f (see Fig. 9 for the definition of transfer matrix).\r
FIG. 9. (Color online) The illustration of the transfer matrix for\r
|⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K′ = 3, n′)⟩|. We have ignored to illustrate the\r
transpose conjugation of the tensors for simplicity.\r
show the “local” fidelity F that can give the fidelity f =\r
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2 versus the number of\r
evolution steps n. Note |ψ(K, n)⟩ denotes a K-tensor trans\u0002lationally invariant MPS after n evolution steps.\r
The local fidelity is calculated by the largest eigenvalue of\r
the transfer matrix of |⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′, n′)⟩|. See Fig. 9 as the\r
illustration of the transfer matrix with K = 2 and K′ = 3 as\r
an example. One should take K˜ = 6 tensors from each of the\r
matrix to define the transfer matrix, with K˜ the least common\r
multiple of K and K′. The local fidelity is calculated as the\r
norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.\r
Specifically, we have\r
f = F\r
N\r
K˜ , (E1)\r
with the system size N → ∞ in the thermodynamic limit.\r
One always has f → 0 when the difference between the lo\u0002cal tensors of two MPS’s lead the dominant eigenvalue to be\r
smaller than 1. Therefore, we choose the local fidelity F to\r
characterize the similarity between two infinite-size MPS’s\r
rather than the fidelity f.\r
In Fig. 8(a), we take γ = 0.49 and γ˜ = 0, where the Hamil\u0002tonian consists of just two-body couplings. All local fidelities\r
converge to 1, meaning the MPS’s stably converge to |ψ(K =\r
6, n = 1000)⟩. In Fig. 8(b), we introduce the three-body cou\u0002plings by taking γ˜ = 0.03. The MPS with 6-tensor transla\u0002tional invariance converges well as n increases. However, the\r
fidelity F = |⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2con\u0002verges to about 0.1. This is due to the inconsistency between\r
the translational invariance (K = 2) and the 3-body coupling\r
terns. Therefore, we trust the results with K = 6.

Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous\r

Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and\r
long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of\r
the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task\r
involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrodinger equations in the canonical quantization ¨\r
picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time\r
evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of\r
iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths\r
where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal\r
the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length\r
against the virtual bond dimension χ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two\r
scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but\r
were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge\r
c = 1, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of\r
three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at\r
the dividing point. Our work uncovers the scaling behaviors of EE in the continuous-space quantum many-body\r
systems. These results provide solid numerical evidence supporting the high efficiency of TN in representing\r
the continuous-space quantum many-body wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit, and meanwhile suggest\r
an efficient approach to study the entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Developing efficient approaches for simulating strongly\u0002correlated quantum systems is a long-standing topic of inter\u0002est. A well-established treatment is lattice approximation that\r
leads to quantum lattice models such as Heisenberg and Hub\u0002bard models, where tensor network (TN) methods [1–4] have\r
been successfully adopted to reveal fruitful exotic phenom\u0002ena such as quantum criticality and quantum topological or\u0002ders [5–10]. The success of TN methods in simulating quan\u0002tum lattice models is solidly supported by the scaling theo\u0002ries of entanglement entropy (EE) [11–17]. For instance, ma\u0002trix product state (MPS) [18, 19] can faithfully represent the\r
states satisfying one-dimensional (1D) area law of EE, which\r
include the ground states of gapped 1D Hamiltonians with lo\u0002cal couplings [12, 20, 21]. For 1D critical quantum lattice\r
models, the criticality (such as central charge) can be accu\u0002rately accessed by the scaling behaviors of MPS [11–13, 17].\r
Without lattice approximation, the main challenge lies in\r
solving the many-body Schrodinger equations, which are ¨\r
multi-variable partial differential equations (PDE’s). Analyt\u0002ical solutions are nearly infeasible. Numerical methods, such\r
as Monte Carlo [22–25] and neural-network schemes [26–\r
30], are severely hindered by the so-called “exponential wall”,\r
namely the complexity (say the dimension of sampling space)\r
scales exponentially with the system size. Meanwhile, theo\u0002ries and methods established for quantum lattice models, such\r
as EE and its scaling laws, can hardly be applied to the quan-\r

tum models in continuous space. These severely hinder the in\u0002vestigation of the realistic quantum systems such as the quan\u0002tum materials with strong correlations.\r
In this work, we extend the TN-based imaginary-time evo\u0002lution algorithms for quantum lattice models [31, 32] to the\r
simulation of continuous-space quantum many-body systems\r
by incorporating the continuous-space TN method [33, 34]

2\r
(see Fig. 1). We here adopt the translationally-invariant\r
MPS to solve the time-independent Schrodinger equation (in ¨\r
the canonical quantization form) of infinitely-many coupled\r
quantum oscillators (iCQOs). This Schrodinger equation con- ¨\r
sists of a set of PDE’s with infinitely-many variables. No nu\u0002merical results of solving these PDE’s were reported to our\r
best knowledge, due to the infinite number of variables in\u0002volved. One may refer to Refs. [35–37] on solving PDE’s with\r
finite variables by MPS. The translationally-invariant MPS is\r
used to represent the infinitely-many coefficients of the wave\u0002function in a set of orthonormal functional bases.\r
By leveraging the advantages of canonical MPS [31] on ef\u0002ficiently simulating entanglement and correlations of quantum\r
many-body states, we investigate the criticality of iCQOs with\r
the presence of two- and three-body coupling terms. With\r
just the two-body terms, we determine the range of coupling\r
strength where there exists a physical ground-state solution\r
(i.e., real ground-state energy as the Hamiltonian is hermi\u0002tian [38]), which we dub as physical region. At the divid\u0002ing point between the physical and non-physical regions, we\r
uncover that the ground-state EE and correlation length sat\u0002isfy the critical scaling laws (against the virtual dimension of\r
MPS), which were previously uncovered in the critical quan\u0002tum lattice models [11, 13, 16, 39]. The scaling coefficients\r
result in a central charge c = 1 [40, 41], indicating that the\r
ground state of iCQOs can be described by free boson confor\u0002mal field theory (CFT) [42]. With three-body couplings, we\r
show the breakdown of CFT even with very weak three-body\r
couplings. Our work explicitly shows the satisfaction of the\r
1D scaling laws of EE, which can serve as solid supports on\r
MPS as an efficient ansatz to represent the ground-state wave\u0002functions of continuous-space many-body systems, including\r
those in the thermodynamic limit.\r
II. IMAGINARY-TIME EVOLUTION FOR THE\r
GROUND-STATE SIMULATION OF INFINITELY-MANY\r
COUPLED QUANTUM OSCILLATORS\r
To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body sys\u0002tems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is a\r
normalized many-variable function denoted as ψ(x) with x =\r
(x1, x2, . . .), in a set of complete functional bases {ϕsn(xn)}.\r
A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which are exponen\u0002tially many, in an MPS whose complexity scales just linearly\r
with the system size (i.e., number of variables) [33, 34]. The\r
infinite functional MPS is written as\r
ψ(x) = tTr \u0012 Y∞\r
n=1\r

\u0013\r
,(1)\r
with tTr the summation of all shared indexes. We take\r
the Planck constant ℏ = 1 for simplicity. We here\r
choose the functional bases to be “local”, i.e., constructed\r
by the single-variable functions {ϕsn(xn)} that satisfy\r
R ∞\r
−∞ ϕ\r
∗\r
s\r
(x)ϕs\r
′ (x)dx = δss′ . The physical dimension (the\r
bond dimension of physical index sn, denoted as D) deter\u0002mines the order of expansion, namely dim(sn) in {ϕsn\r
(xn)}.\r
The virtual dimension (the dimension of virtual index an, de\u0002noted as χ) determines the number of expansion terms. Both\r
dimensions determine the parameter complexity of the MPS.\r
To efficiently represent the infinite-size wave-functions, we\r
take the MPS to be translationally invariant. Fig. 1 illustrates\r
the MPS satisfying the “two-tensor” translational invariance,\r
namely the MPS is formed by infinitely-many copies of two\r
inequivalent tensors A and B, as well as those of two inequiv\u0002alent spectra (diagonal matrices) λ\r
I\r
and λ\r
II [Fig. 1(a)]. The\r
spectra are necessary to define the canonical form of infinite\r
MPS for the purpose of optimal truncations and entanglement\r
simulations [31]. The number of variational parameters in\r
such an MPS scales approximately as O(Dχ2). In practice,\r
we adopt the “K-tensor” translational invariance. We take\r
K = 2 when there exist only the one- and two-body terms in\r
the Hamiltonian, and K = 6 with the presence of the three\u0002body terms.\r
Translational invariance allows TN methods to efficiently\r
simulate infinite-size quantum many-body systems. For quan\u0002tum lattice models, translational invariance explicitly corre\u0002sponds to the translational invariance of the quantum states\r
with the respect to lattice sites, since the tensors are usually\r
in one-to-one correspondence with the sites. For continuous\u0002space systems (such as iCQOs considered here), there is\r
no such correspondences. The translational invariance re\u0002spects the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, and is not contra\u0002dictory to the indistinguishability of particles. Thus, we re\u0002gard translational invariance as a physically-reasonable con\u0002jecture imposed on the functional MPS ansatz. Note that the\r
Schrodinger equations we aim to solve are in the canonical ¨\r
quantization picture, where the bosonic or fermionic statistics\r
of the wave-functions is not explicitly considered.\r
The Hamiltonian of iCQOs is written as\r

Eexact is real for γ <= γc ≡ 0.5, which we dub as the physical\r
region. Fig. 2 shows the error ε = |Eexact − ⟨ψ|Hˆ |ψ⟩| versus\r
the physical and virtual dimensions (D and χ). The error con\u0002verges to ε ∼ O(10−5\r
), indicating that the ground states can\r
be well approximated by the MPS’s with a finite D or χ.\r
The correlation length ξ and entanglement entropy (EE) S\r
of the ground state can be efficiently accessed by the MPS\r
method [4, 44]. The correlation length is obtained from the\r
eigenvalues of the transfer matrix M of the infinite MPS [see\r
the inset of Fig. 3(a) for the illustration of M], satisfying\r
ξ =\r
1\r
ln Λ0−ln Λ1\r
with Λ0 and Λ1 the two dominant eigen\u0002values of M. It naturally obeys the standard definition of\r
correlation length of continuous-space wave-functions, which\r
characterizes the decay of correlation function ⟨Oˆ\r
nOˆn′ ⟩ ver\u0002sus |n − n\r
′\r
|. The EE of continuous-space wave-functions is\r
much less investigated. Here, the canonical form of the infi\u0002nite MPS gives us a well-defined entanglement spectrum. The\r
EE can then be defined as S = −2\r

difference between the EE’s calculated from the two spectra\r
is about O(10−3), which is the result of numerical errors.\r
When γ is far away from the dividing point γ = 0.5, both\r
the correlation length ξ and EE S converge as χ increases\r
(Fig. 3). We fix D = 16, which should be sufficiently large.\r
FIG. 3. (Color online) (a) The correlation length ξ and (b) EE S\r
versus the virtual bond dimension χ. We vary the strength of the\r
two-body interaction from γ = 0.49 to 0.5 by fixing D = 16. The\r
correlation length is computed using the transfer matrix of the infi\u0002nite MPS illustrated in the inset of (a). The inset of (b) shows the\r
convergence of central charge c → 1 against χmax (meaning the fit\u0002ting is implemented with the data for χ ≤ χmax). Fittings of ξ and S\r
are given by the dashed lines, which obey algebraic and logarithmic\r
scaling laws, respectively [see Eqs. (4) and (5)].\r
These results indicate the finiteness of correlation length and\r
EE for the ground state of iCQOs within the physical region,\r
which are typical signatures of a finite excitation gap. This\r
suggests that an infinite functional MPS with finite bond di\u0002mensions can well approximate such non-critical many-body\r
wave-functions.\r
As γ approaches the dividing point, both ξ and S become\r
asymptotically divergent (Fig. 3). At γ = 0.5, our results\r
suggest the algebraic scaling law of correlation length as\r
ξ ∼ χ\r
κ\r
, (4)\r
and meanwhile the logarithmic scaling law of EE as\r
S ∼ η ln χ. (5)\r
We have κ ≃ 1.32 and η ≃ 0.23. These two scaling laws\r
are recognized as signatures of criticality for quantum lattice\r
models [13], but haven’t been uncovered in the continuous\u0002space systems such as iCQOs. Our work reveals that even\r
with divergent correlation length and EE, the continuous\u0002space wave-functions can still be asymptotically approached\r
by MPS in a similar manner for approaching the critical quan\u0002tum lattice systems.\r
The critical properties can be further characterized by the\r
scaling coefficients. From CFT, we can estimate the central\r
charge as\r
c =\r
6η\r
κ\r
= 1 + O(10−2). (6)\r
This suggests the wave-function at the dividing point between\r
the physical and non-physical regions to be described by the\r
c = 1 boson CFT [42]. The inset of Fig. 3(b) demonstrates\r
the convergence of c versus χ."""

after χ ≃ 25 for γ = 0.499 (or after χ ≃ 15 for γ = 0.495).\r

V. SUMMARY\r
This work concerns simulating the ground-state wave\u0002functions and their entanglement properties of infinite-size\r
quantum many-body systems in continuous space. We com\u0002bine the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm\r
with functional tensor network (TN) to simulate the ground\r
states of infinite coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs) defined\r
in continuous space. At the dividing point between the phys\u0002ical and non-physical regions with just two-body couplings,\r

we reveal algebraic scaling laws of the correlation length and\r
logarithmic scaling laws of the entanglement entropy (EE)\r

suggest the c = 1 boson conformal field theory (CFT) describ\u0002ing the criticality at the dividing point. We further show that\r
the three-body terms break down the criticality and the CFT\r
description on the dividing boundary. Our work demonstrates\r
the validity of EE scaling theories based on TN for investi\u0002gating the quantum many-body systems in continuous space.\r
The satisfactions of EE scaling laws serves as a solid evidence\r
on the efficiency of TN for approximating continuous-space\r
wave-functions and for accessing the properties of criticality\r
of continuous-space quantum many-body systems.\r

Appendix A: Functional matrix product state and operators\r
To simulate the continuous-space quantum many-body sys\u0002tems, we expand the many-body wave-function, which is\r
a normalized many-variable function denoted as ψ(x) with

5\r
x = (x1, x2, . . .), in a set of orthonormal functional bases\r
{ϕsn(xn)}. A key idea is to encode the coefficients, which\r
are exponentially many, in a tensor network (TN) whose com\u0002plexity scales just polynomially with the system size [33, 34].\r
Here, we take the matrix product state (MPS), where the\r
many-body wave-function can be expressed as\r
ψ(x) =\r
D−\r

s1···sN =0\r
Cs1···sN ϕs1\r

Below, we adopt the infinite MPS, which is a simple but\r
powerful TN to represent infinite-size quantum states. To rep\u0002resent many-body wave-functions in the continuous space, the\r
infinite functional MPS can be written as\r
ψ(x) = tTr \u0012 Y∞\r

with tTr denoting the summation over all shared indexes.\r
The indexes αn (n = 1, · · · , N − 1) are dubbed as vir\u0002tual bonds. The upper bound of their dimensions dim(αn)\r
is called the virtual bond dimension, denoted by χ. The in\u0002dexes {sn} are called the physical bonds, with their dimen\u0002sions called the physical bond dimension , denoted by D. In\r
our cases for representing continuous-space wave-functions,\r
D determines the expansion order in the functional bases. The\r
number of parameters in the MPS (i.e., the total number of el\u0002ements in the tensors {A(n)} for n = 1, · · · , N) scales only\r
linearly with N as O(NDχ\r
2\r
), while the number of coeffi\u0002cients in ψ(x) scales exponentially as O(DN ).\r
The MPS is formed by infinite copies of four inequivalent\r
tensors, which are third-order tensors A, B, and vectors (or\r
diagonal matrices) λ\r
I\r
, λ\r
II. Such an MPS is called two-site\r
or two-tensor (considering A and B are defined on the sites)\r
translationally invariant.\r
To solve the Schrodinger equation for the ground state, we ¨\r
need to obtain the coefficients of operators in the same func\u0002tional bases. Considering an operator Oˆ(m) with respect to the\r
variable xm, acting it on ψ(x) yields\r

Appendix C: Infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm\r
The ground state of a given Hamiltonian can be simulated\r
using the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD)\r
algorithm [32]. We start from the definition of the time\u0002evolution operator\r

evolution. See Eqs. (C3)-(C5).\r
with τ a small positive number representing a short time slice.\r
Note that Uˆ(τ ) is the product of infinitely-many copies of lo\u0002cal time-evolution operator Uˆ = e\r
−τHˆn,n+1 . The ground state\r
|ψ0⟩ can be approached by evolving an initial state |ψ0⟩ until\r
it converges, where we have\r

(\r

n\r
Uˆ(τ ))K = |ψ0⟩, (C2)\r
with Z the normalization factor. An illustration of the evolu\u0002tion is given in Fig. 6(a).\r
With the presence of three-body terms, we assume the MPS\r
to be 6-tensor translationally invariant, which is formed by\r
infinitely-many copies of 6 third-order tensors and 6 spectra\r
(diagonal matrices). The three-body evolution operator can\r
be readily defined to implement the imaginary-time evolution\r
with the presence of three-body coupling terms. Below, we\r
still take the simulation without three-body terms (γ˜ = 0) as\r
an example to explain the algorithm.\r
Similar to Eq. (A8), the local operators (copies of Uˆ) are\r
contracted with the local tensors in the MPS sequentially. For\r
instance, considering the contraction of Uˆ, A, B, and the rel\u0002evant spectra, we have\r

SVD on T as\r

with T [0,1],[2,3] being the matrization of T by reshaping its\r

Eq. (D1) for the contraction formula corresponding to the left panel.\r
Obviously, the new indexes obtained by SVD and the new\r
spectrum λ\r
II possess a larger dimension. Without any trunca\u0002tion, the dimension will increase exponentially with the evo\u0002lution time. What we do in the iTEBD algorithm is if this\r
dimension exceeds the preset maximum (denoted as χ), it\r
should be truncated to χ by keeping only the χ-largest sin\u0002gular values and the corresponding singular vectors.\r

Appendix D: Canonical form of matrix product state\r
With τ → 0, the evolution given by Uˆ(τ ) is close to be\r
identical. Therefore, the evolution drives the MPS to the\r
so-called canonical form [31], where the tensors satisfy the\r
canonical conditions illustrated in Fig. 7. As an example, the\r
contraction given by the left panel reads\r

with I representing the identity. The canonical conditions can\r
be generalized to the cases with K-tensor translational invari\u0002ance.\r
We here utilize two advantages of the MPS being in the\r
canonical form. First, the truncations implemented in the\r
iTEBD algorithm are (nearly) optimal. By “nearly”, we mean\r
that the MPS approaches (but is not in) the strict canonical\r
form in the nearly-identical evolution given by Uˆ(τ ). Sec\u0002ond, it has been proven that the spectra (λ\r
I\r
and λ\r
II) give the\r
entanglement spectra for the bipartitions at the corresponding\r
positions. These two advantages hold not only for MPS rep\u0002resenting the quantum many-body states of lattice models, but\r
also the functional MPS’s that represent the wave-functions in\r
the continuous space as well as for the functional MPS’s with\r
K-tensor translational invariance.\r
Appendix E: Simulation of local fidelity\r
Fig. 8 shows the convergence with the MPS’s of dif\u0002ferent translational symmetries. We consider the K-tensor\r
translationally invariant MPS’s with K = 2, 3, 4, 6 and\r
FIG. 8. (Color online) Local fidelity F from the fidelity f =\r
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2versus the evolution step n\r
with different translational invariances (K = 2, 3, 4, 6). F is cal\u0002culated as the norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer\r
matrix of f (see Fig. 9 for the definition of transfer matrix).\r
FIG. 9. (Color online) The illustration of the transfer matrix for\r
|⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K′ = 3, n′)⟩|. We have ignored to illustrate the\r
transpose conjugation of the tensors for simplicity.\r
show the “local” fidelity F that can give the fidelity f =\r
|⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2 versus the number of\r
evolution steps n. Note |ψ(K, n)⟩ denotes a K-tensor trans\u0002lationally invariant MPS after n evolution steps.\r
The local fidelity is calculated by the largest eigenvalue of\r
the transfer matrix of |⟨ψ(K, n)|ψ(K′, n′)⟩|. See Fig. 9 as the\r
illustration of the transfer matrix with K = 2 and K′ = 3 as\r
an example. One should take K˜ = 6 tensors from each of the\r
matrix to define the transfer matrix, with K˜ the least common\r
multiple of K and K′. The local fidelity is calculated as the\r
norm square of the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix.\r
Specifically, we have\r
f = F\r
N\r
K˜ , (E1)\r
with the system size N → ∞ in the thermodynamic limit.\r
One always has f → 0 when the difference between the lo\u0002cal tensors of two MPS’s lead the dominant eigenvalue to be\r
smaller than 1. Therefore, we choose the local fidelity F to\r
characterize the similarity between two infinite-size MPS’s\r
rather than the fidelity f.\r
In Fig. 8(a), we take γ = 0.49 and γ˜ = 0, where the Hamil\u0002tonian consists of just two-body couplings. All local fidelities\r
converge to 1, meaning the MPS’s stably converge to |ψ(K =\r
6, n = 1000)⟩. In Fig. 8(b), we introduce the three-body cou\u0002plings by taking γ˜ = 0.03. The MPS with 6-tensor transla\u0002tional invariance converges well as n increases. However, the\r
fidelity F = |⟨ψ(K = 2, n)|ψ(K′ = 6, n′ = 1000)⟩|2con\u0002verges to about 0.1. This is due to the inconsistency between\r
the translational invariance (K = 2) and the 3-body coupling\r
terns. Therefore, we trust the results with K = 6.
