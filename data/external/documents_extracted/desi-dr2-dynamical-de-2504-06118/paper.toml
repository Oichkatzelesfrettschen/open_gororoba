(Dated: September 22, 2025)\r
Understanding whether cosmic acceleration arises from a cosmological constant or a dynamical\r
component is a central goal of cosmology, and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\r
enables stringent tests with high-precision distance measurements. We analyze baryon acoustic oscil\u0002lation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2), combined\r
with Type Ia supernovae and a cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior. With the larger\r
statistical power and wider redshift coverage of DR2, the preference for dynamical dark energy does\r
not diminish relative to DR1. Using both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric ap\u0002proaches with a Horndeski-motivated correlation prior, we find that the dark-energy equation of\r
state w(z) varies with redshift. BAO data alone yield modest constraints, but in combination with\r
independent supernova compilations and the CMB prior they strengthen the evidence for dynamics.\r
Bayesian model comparison shows moderate support for departures from ΛCDM when multiple\r
degrees of freedom in w(z) are allowed, corresponding to ≈ 3σ tension with ΛCDM (and higher\r
for some data sets). Despite methodological differences, our results are consistent with companion\r
DESI papers, underscoring the complementarity of approaches. Possible systematics remain under\r
study; forthcoming DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB data will provide decisive tests.\r

I. INTRODUCTION\r
One of the most enduring puzzles in modern cosmology\r
is the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The impe\u0002tus for introducing an additional component beyond or\u0002dinary matter first arose in the 1980s, when early cosmic\r
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy calculations\r
showed that a low-density open model would conflict with

3\r
small-scale CMB observations. Subsequently, large-scale\r
clustering analyses [1] and baryon-fraction arguments [2]\r
made it clear that a Universe consisting solely of critical\u0002density dark matter was untenable, prompting the emer\u0002gence of a cosmological constant (Λ) as the leading expla\u0002nation. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) then\r
provided direct evidence for an accelerating cosmic ex\u0002pansion [3, 4], and by the turn of the millennium, the\r
ΛCDM framework was firmly established as the consen\u0002sus model of cosmology. This paradigm has been contin\u0002uously supported by increasingly precise CMB measure\u0002ments [5] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data [6],\r
solidifying its status as the standard picture of cosmic ac\u0002celeration.\r
Despite this consensus, the fundamental cause of cos\u0002mic acceleration remains elusive. A widely favored in\u0002terpretation involves postulating an effective dark en\u0002ergy (DE) component that dominates the current energy\r
density of the Universe (see [7–9] for reviews). Provided\r
its sound speed is not too small, DE can be treated as\r
nearly homogeneous on sub-sound-horizon scales, leaving\r
its main cosmological signatures determined by its energy\r
density ρ and pressure P. The equation of state (EoS),\r
w ≡ P/c2ρ, serves as a crucial diagnostic: w = −1 cor\u0002responds to vacuum energy, while dynamical DE models\r
allow w to vary with time, as exemplified by quintessence\r
[10], phantom [11], quintom [12], k-essence [13], Chaply\u0002gin gas [14], and holographic dark energy [15]. Subclasses\r
of these scenarios can be further differentiated by exam\u0002ining their trajectories in the phase space spanned by\r
\r
w, dw/d ln a\r
\u0001\r
, where a is the cosmic scale factor [16].\r
Recent observational progress, including supernova\r
measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [17],\r
as well as other large SNe compilations such as Pan\u0002theonPlus [18, 19] and Union [20], high-precision CMB\r
data from the Planck Collaboration [21], and BAO results\r
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) eBOSS pro\u0002gram [22], has significantly refined our insight into DE.\r
These complementary probes constrain DE-related pa\u0002rameters with growing precision, thus enhancing our un\u0002derstanding of cosmic acceleration. While combined anal\u0002yses that integrate all available datasets provide the most\r
stringent overall limits, it remains instructive to consider\r
each probe in isolation. Such a modular approach not\r
only underscores the unique strengths and systematics of\r
each measurement but also furnishes critical cross-checks,\r
reinforcing the robustness of DE constraints.\r
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)’s\r
Data Release 1 (DR1) [23] and Data Release 2 (DR2)\r
[24, 25] BAO observations place stringent limits on the\r
Universe’s background expansion history, achieving a\r
level of precision on a par with recent SNe surveys. These\r
include the PantheonPlus compilation of 1,550 spectro\u0002scopically confirmed SNe [18, 19], the Union3 compilation\r
of 2,087 SNe [20], and the five-year Dark Energy Survey\r
sample (DESY5) [17].\r
In this paper we probe dark-energy dynamics along two\r
complementary routes. First, we fit the distance ladder\r
with a shape-function formalism that makes no explicit\r
assumption about the equation of state. Secondly, we\r
carry out a fully Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) in which\r
a correlation prior derived from the Horndeski gravity\r
[26] yields an interpretable Bayes factor, recovering the\r
standard (w0, wa) result [27, 28] with two effective de\u0002grees of freedom. Although these techniques differ from\r
the Gaussian-process and (w0, wa) analyses presented in\r
the companion DESI studies [25, 29], all approaches paint\r
a coherent picture: DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO measure\u0002ments, together with three different Type Ia supernova\r
samples, indicate the same mild, oscillatory departure\r
from a cosmological constant. The convergence of results\r
across data sets and methodologies strengthens the sta\u0002tistical case for an evolving dark energy component.\r
II. A SHAPE-FUNCTION ANALYSIS OF DARK\r
ENERGY\r
The shape function S0(a) illustrates how dark energy\r
grows relative to matter, and the function S1(a) re\u0002veals whether and how the dark energy pressure changes\r
with time. Finally, S2(a)—often referred to as the ‘state\u0002finder’ parameter [30, 31]—encodes both w(a) and its\r
derivative, making it particularly useful for distinguish\u0002ing among dark energy models (See Methods for the de\u0002fination and more details of the shape functions). For\r
example, a ‘freezing’ quintessence scenario predicts S2 <\r
−1 [32], whereas barotropic fluid models require S2 > −1\r
[33]. If S2 crosses the −1 threshold during cosmic evolu\u0002tion, it may indicate that multiple dark energy compo\u0002nents dominate at different epochs.\r
Fig. 1 displays the reconstructed S functions derived\r
from DESI BAO and three SNe datasets, based on\r
Eqs. (2)–(5). All panels reveal a systematic deviation\r
from the ΛCDM baseline, and this pattern of deviation\r
is consistent across the four datasets, indicating a shared\r
underlying trend.\r
A key point is that the DESI DR2 sample uncovers a\r
stronger dynamical DE signal than DESI DR1. In partic\u0002ular, S0 and S1 both lie systematically above the ΛCDM\r
expectation in DR2, pointing to a more pronounced de\u0002parture from a pure cosmological constant. Even more\r
notably, S2 in DR2 exhibits a sharper crossing behavior\r
relative to DR1, suggesting that the observed expansion\r
may not be fully described by standard ΛCDM.\r
This amplified crossing, coupled with smaller uncer\u0002tainties, bolsters the case for dark energy possessing\r
additional internal degrees of freedom. Further rein\u0002forcing this conclusion, the DR2-based reconstructions\r
closely match those obtained from three independent\r
SNe samples. Their broad consistency indicates that\r
these deviations probably reflect real dynamical evo\u0002lution of the dark energy; for this not to be the case,\r
a number of different systematics would all need to\r
conspire in the same direction. Although DR2 provides\r
stronger statistical evidence overall, uncertainties remain

significant at z ≳ 0.5, limiting definitive conclusions\r
at higher redshifts. Even so, the alignment between\r
DESI DR2 and SNe data underscores the importance of\r
forthcoming high-precision measurements for clarifying\r
the fundamental nature and potential evolution of dark\r
energy.\r
III. EVOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF\r
STATE\r
To explore this further, we adopt the commonly used\r
w0–wa parameterization [27, 28], in which the dark en\u0002ergy equation of state is written as w(a) = w0 + wa (1 −\r
a). Here, w0 is the present-day equation-of-state value,\r
while wa describes how w evolves with redshift. Notably,\r
ΛCDM is recovered by setting w0 = −1 and wa = 0.\r
Fitting this model to the data constrains the possible\r
dynamical nature of dark energy in a simple yet effec\u0002tive manner. Moreover, the w0–wa approach serves as a\r
bridge between the shape-function reconstructions and\r
the fully non-parametric w(z) methods discussed later,\r
offering an intermediate step toward more general dark\r
energy modeling.\r
Fig. 2 shows the inferred constraints on (w0, wa) for\r
different data combinations (See Methods for datasets\r
and priors used). The left panel corresponds to DESI\r
DR1, while the right panel presents DR2. Contour colors\r
indicate various datasets, with inner and outer contours\r
marking 1σ and 2σ confidence intervals, respectively. We\r
divide the parameter space into four dark energy models:\r
Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs, thus w0 > −1 and\r
w0+wa > −1) [10], Full Phantom (w < −1 at all epochs,\r
thus w0 < −1 and w0 + wa < −1) [11], Quintom A\r
(w > −1 in the past but w < −1 today, thus w0 < −1\r
and w0 + wa > −1) [12], and Quintom B (w < −1 in the\r
past but w > −1 today, thus w0 > −1 and w0+wa < −1)\r
[12].\r
Using only DESI DR1 BAO measurements yields con\u0002straints that are broadly consistent with ΛCDM, albeit\r
with mild (∼ 1.5–2σ) hints of departure. Incorporating\r
supernova data narrows these contours further, indicat\u0002ing a slight preference for dynamical dark energy. A sim\u0002ilar pattern emerges from the DR2-only analysis, which\r
achieves notably tighter constraints than DR1 and favors

evidence peaks at “moderate” support for dynamical w(z) once SNe are included. The strength of this prior is varied by adding\r
different values of ∆ to its diagonal. For comparison, we show both the analytically estimated ln E (calculated as ln L + ln V )\r
and the numerically computed values obtained via Polychord. The top panel presents results derived using DESI DR1 BAO\r
data, while the bottom panel corresponds to DESI DR2. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the\r
CMB acoustic scale θ∗ are imposed in all cases. The shaded region highlights values of ∆ for which the correlation prior is\r
affected by the flat prior of the w bins. See texts for further discussion.

w0 > −1 with wa < 0, consistent with a Quintom B-like\r
scenario. Even so, ΛCDM remains viable at ∼ 1.5σ. This\r
is weaker than the 2.3σ rejection of ΛCDM in [25] from\r
DESI+CMB, because our CMB prior uses only part of\r
the information, and also because we have chosen to in\u0002flate uncertainties. When DR2 is combined with super\u0002nova data, the best-fit values stay in the Quintom B re\u0002gion, pushing the tension with ΛCDM above 2σ, showing\r
somewhat stronger preference for departure from a sim\u0002ple cosmological constant (see Supplementary Tables 1\r
and 2 for more details).\r
To delve deeper into the dynamical nature of dark en\u0002ergy, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruc\u0002tion of w(z) using the correlation-prior framework orig\u0002inally proposed in [34, 35] and subsequently applied in\r
[36, 37]. In this methodology, w(z) is treated as a free\r
function, while a correlation prior enforces smoothness\r
and mitigates flat directions in the likelihood. The corre\u0002lation prior itself can be motivated by theoretical consid\u0002erations [38]; here, we adopt the version derived in [38]\r
from Horndeski theory [26] (See Methods for details of\r
the reconstruction).\r
Fig. 3 (white curves and blue bands) illustrates the\r
best-fit and 68% CL constraints on w(z) obtained from\r
various data combinations. The upper row corresponds\r
to DESI DR1 BAO data, and the lower row to DR2.\r
In each row, the leftmost panel reports BAO-only con\u0002straints, while the other panels incorporate additional su\u0002pernova datasets: PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. In\r
all cases, w(z) ̸= −1 is clearly indicated. Throughout the\r
paper, we define the significance (i.e., the signal-to-noise\r
ratio, SNR) of the reconstructed w(z) deviating from a\r
specific model wmod via\r
SNR2 ≡ (w − wmod)\r
T C−1\r
w (w − wmod), (1)\r
where Cw is the posterior covariance for the w bins. For\r
the DR1-based reconstructions (panels A1–A4), the SNR\r
of w ̸= −1 is 2.6, 3.9, 3.9, and 4.2, respectively. Switch\u0002ing to the DR2 dataset yields comparable significance at\r
2.6, 3.7, 4.3, and 4.5, respectively. It is interesting that\r
the preference for deviations from ΛCDM when the SNe\r
samples are included remained strong with the enhanced\r
statistical power of DESI DR2.\r
All dataset combinations exhibit a persistent pattern\r
in w(z): w > −1 at z ≲ 0.2 and w < −1 at z ∼ 0.75,\r
which is consistent with the results reported in com\u0002panion DESI papers [25, 29]. Including supernova data\r
highlights this feature further, revealing pronounced os\u0002cillations in w(z). These patterns remain stable and gain\r
additional significance when DR1 BAO is replaced by\r
DR2. In fact, oscillatory or non-monotonic w(z) evolution\r
arises naturally in several classes of dark energy models\r
– including axion-like quintessence scenarios with peri\u0002odic potentials [39], interacting dark sector frameworks,\r
where energy exchange between dark energy and dark\r
matter can induce transient oscillations in w [40, 41],\r
and multi-field quintom constructions that allow w(z)\r
to cross the −1 threshold and back [12, 42]. Crucially,\r
the oscillatory feature seen in our reconstruction is not\r
an artifact of any single dataset: it appears consistently\r
across different Type Ia supernova samples and remains\r
essentially unchanged when the BAO dataset is upgraded\r
from DESI DR1 to DR2. This stability across indepen\u0002dent data sets and updated observations reinforces the\r
interpretation that the observed oscillations in w(z) are\r
a robust physical signal, potentially pointing toward an\r
underlying dynamical dark energy component consistent\r
with the aforementioned model classes.\r
The green bands—reconstructions using the CPL pa\u0002rameterization—track the transition across w = −1 well\r
and are broadly compatible with the non-parametric re\u0002sults, reinforcing the robustness of these conclusions.\r
While the significance of w ̸= −1 stems from the re\u0002duction in χ\r
2\r
relative to ΛCDM, fully assessing the fit\r
also requires determining the effective degrees of freedom\r
(DoF) in the reconstructed w(z). This step is nontrivial\r
because the correlation prior couples the w(z) bins. To\r
address this, we perform a principal component analysis\r
(PCA) [43] to decorrelate the prior and posterior inverse\r
covariance matrices of w(z). Further technical details on\r
the PCA procedure can be found in the Supplementary\r
Information.\r
Fig. 4 shows the PCA results for the reconstructed dark\r
energy equation of state w(z). The left panels (A1–A4)\r
plot the eigenvectors of the first few well-constrained\r
modes, highlighting their redshift dependence, while the\r
right panels (B1–B4) display the corresponding eigen\u0002values λi for different dataset combinations. The PCA\r
identifies independent modes constrained by the data.\r
In panel A1 (BAO-only), the first principal component\r
(PC1) is smooth and relatively featureless, indicating\r
that BAO data alone primarily constrain a single domi\u0002nant mode of w(z). By contrast, adding supernova data\r
(panels A2–A4) produces additional constrained modes;\r
PC2 and PC3 become more oscillatory, especially at low\r
redshift, demonstrating that supernova observations sig\u0002nificantly improve constraints on the redshift evolution\r
of w(z). Because the main feature of w(z) is effectively a\r
linear combination of these three modes, further progress\r
will come from shrinking the PC1 error bar through im\u0002proved low-z SN calibration, tightening PC2 and PC3\r
with denser distance tracers in the 0.3 < z < 0.8 window,\r
and extending observations to z ≳ 0.8 to assess whether\r
additional PCs are required.\r
The right panels show the eigenvalues λi, which quan\u0002tify the statistical significance of each mode (larger val\u0002ues correspond to tighter constraints). In panel B1 (also\r
BAO-only), four eigenvalue notably exceeds that of the\r
correlation prior (green curve). When supernova datasets\r
are incorporated (panels B2–B4), more modes become\r
well constrained. Comparing DESI Data Release 1 (DR1;\r
orange) and Data Release 2 (DR2; blue) eigenvalues re\u0002veals that DR2 consistently achieves larger eigenvalues\r
for the constrained modes, indicating stronger statistical\r
power in the DR2 sample. This gain is most evident when\r
supernova data are included, as the gap between the first

8\r
few eigenvalues of DR1 and DR2 widens, showing that\r
DR2 improves constraints across multiple modes of w(z).\r
We further validate these findings by computing the effec\u0002tive number of degrees of freedom Neff numerically with\r
covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) [44], de\u0002tailed in the Supplementary Information. The CPCA re\u0002sults align with the PCA, confirming the robustness of\r
our assessment of how many independent modes of w(z)\r
are constrained by the data.\r
We can project w(z) onto the PC eigenmodes 1 +\r
w(z) = P\r
i\r
γiei(z) where the corresponding eigenvalue λi\r
of the covariance matrix represents the error of the am\u0002plitude γi\r
, λi = 1/σ2(γi). Supplementary Table 5 shows\r
the amplitude of the first five PCs. Considering the case\r
with DR2 and DR1/DR2 + SNe, the amplitude of the\r
first PC is positive, indicating that this mode describes\r
a behavior of w(z) that increases from −1 over time.\r
The improvement in the fits, ∆χ\r
2 = −\r
P\r
i\r
[γi/σ(γi)]2, is\r
dominated by PC1. Including higher-order PCs, multiple\r
crossings of w = −1 occur, as we observe in the recon\u0002structed w(z) shown in Fig. 3. In the case of DR2 + SNe,\r
PC4 gives the second largest contribution to ∆χ\r
2\r
.\r
It is the advantage of the Bayesian reconstruction\r
that the dependence of the reconstructed w(z) on the\r
correlation prior is explicit. To demonstrate this, we\r
deliberately change the amplitude of the correlation\r
prior, A, and impose a stronger prior to avoid possible\r
overfitting. By tuning A, the effective number of degrees\r
of freedom Neff can be reduced. In the case of Neff = 2,\r
the reconstructed w(z) is consistent with the results\r
that we obtained based on the w0-wa parametrization as\r
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, with related ∆χ\r
2\r
shown\r
in Supplementary Table 6.\r
IV. BAYESIAN EVIDENCE AND EVOLUTION\r
We evaluate the evidence against ΛCDM analytically\r
and numerically (see Methods for details), as illustrated\r
in Fig. 5. Consistent with expectations, ln L grows while\r
ln V decreases monotonically with increasing ∆ (or Neff),\r
which reflects the number of modes in w(z) that remain\r
after applying the correlation prior. The analytic and\r
numerical evidence estimates typically agree, except in\r
BAO-only scenarios, where the data are not sufficiently\r
constraining to maintain Gaussianity in the posterior.\r
Fig. 5 plots the model evidence and related quantities\r
versus ∆, with the effective degrees of freedom Neff noted\r
on the top axis. The top panels show DESI DR1 re\u0002sults, and the bottom panels DESI DR2. We display the\r
change in log-likelihood ∆ ln L (blue squares), the an\u0002alytic ∆ ln E (orange circles), the numerical ∆ ln E (red\r
points), and the change in log-prior volume ∆ ln V (green\r
diamonds).\r
The increase in both ∆ ln E and the signal-to-noise ra\u0002tio (SNR) for detecting w ̸= −1 with larger Neff fur\u0002ther supports the idea that adding extra degrees of free\u0002dom favors a dynamical dark energy interpretation over\r
a pure cosmological constant. When using BAO data\r
alone, ∆ ln E remains consistent with zero for all Neff,\r
confirming that BAO measurements by themselves offer\r
limited evidence against ΛCDM. In contrast, once super\u0002nova datasets are added, ∆ ln E rises substantially. For\r
instance, DR1 + DESY5 yields a peak ∆ ln E of 4.1±0.6\r
(classified as “Moderate” on Jeffreys’ scale [45–47]) at\r
Neff = 2, increasing to 5.2 ± 0.7 (also “Moderate”) for\r
DR2 + DESY5 at Neff = 3. A similar pattern emerges\r
with BAO + Union3: the evidence systematically in\u0002creases from DR1 to DR2, reaching 3.3 ± 0.7 (“Moder\u0002ate”) at Neff = 3 for DR2.\r
By contrast, BAO + PantheonPlus shows weaker ev\u0002idence, changing only slightly from DR1 to DR2, with\r
∆ ln E peaking at 1.5±0.6 (“Weak”) in DR1 and 1.4±0.7\r
(“Weak”) in DR2—consistent with what is seen under\r
the CPL parameterization. Although the PantheonPlus\r
dataset alone can show a mild preference for w ̸= −1\r
(see Supplementary Fig. 2), combining it with BAO data\r
partially cancels that signal. One possibility is a mild\r
tension between the PantheonPlus-inferred distance scale\r
and the BAO-preferred expansion history, pushing the\r
joint constraints closer to ΛCDM. Further investigation\r
is needed to determine whether this is attributable to\r
systematics.\r
To gauge the strongest possible deviation from w = −1\r
without overfitting the data, we look at w(z)CDM mod\u0002els with the largest departure from ΛCDM while still\r
having a positive evidence, ı.e. ∆ ln E ≥ 0. Under this\r
condition, the significance of w ̸= −1 for BAO + DESY5\r
reaches 4.1 (DR1) and 4.3 (DR2). For BAO + Union3,\r
the corresponding values are 3.8 (DR1) and 3.9 (DR2).\r
Meanwhile, BAO + PantheonPlus yields maximum\r
SNRs of 3.2 (DR1) and 3.1 (DR2), reinforcing the prior\r
finding that PantheonPlus offers comparatively weaker\r
support for w ̸= −1 than either Union3 or DESY5.\r
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\r
With the start of the DESI survey, we now have ac\u0002cess to exceptionally precise BAO measurements, pro\u0002viding a robust tool to probe the nature of dark energy.\r
In this work, we analyzed DESI DR2 BAO observations\r
in tandem with complementary cosmic distance indica\u0002tors— SNe data and the CMB acoustic scale θ∗—to test\r
for deviations from the ΛCDM paradigm. Employing a\r
shape-function approach [48, 49], we derived key observ\u0002ables sensitive to dark energy (DE) and found consistent\r
evidence for an evolving equation of state w(z) across\r
multiple, independent datasets.\r
Building on these findings, we performed a non\u0002parametric Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) by jointly\r
analyzing DESI BAO, SNe, and CMB data, employing a\r
correlation prior rooted in Horndeski theory. Our results\r
exhibit strong statistical support for dynamical dark en-

9\r
ergy, at a confidence level exceeding 3σ. Rigorous model\r
selection further indicates that DESI BAO, SNe, and\r
CMB observations together constrain roughly three inde\u0002pendent degrees of freedom (DoFs) without overfitting.\r
In particular, combining DESI BAO, CMB, and the five\u0002year DES supernova sample detects dark energy evolu\u0002tion at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.9, with a Bayesian evi\u0002dence of 5.2±0.7 in favor of w(z)CDM over ΛCDM when\r
Neff = 3.\r
These results suggest that dark energy may not be\r
described by a simple cosmological constant, favoring a\r
time-dependent equation of state w(z) instead. Although\r
earlier work [37] hinted at similar conclusions, this study\r
provides some of the tightest constraints to date, thanks\r
in large part to the enhanced statistical power of DESI\r
DR2 BAO data. Furthermore, adding supernova datasets\r
significantly boosts sensitivity to potential dark energy\r
evolution: all three independent SN samples (Pantheon\u0002Plus, Union3, and DESY5) show broadly consistent in\u0002dications of deviations from ΛCDM.\r
Companion DESI papers [25, 29] investigate the time\r
evolution of dark energy using complementary methods,\r
and also report the detection of the dynamical dark en\u0002ergy. The level of significance is generally greater in those\r
works because the full Planck measurements are used\r
there, as opposed to the θ∗ information used in this\r
work. Moreover, the recent Atacama Cosmology Tele\u0002scope (ACT) results find that the time evolution of dark\r
energy is still favored when replacing the Planck data\r
with the ACT measurements [50].\r
Extensive cross-checks indicate that known system\u0002atics cannot mimic the oscillatory pattern in Fig. 3.\r
Photometric offsets and a possible evolution of the\r
colour–luminosity relation in PantheonPlus can shift\r
w(z) by about 0.03 at z ≲ 0.4 [19], and the 0.04 mag\r
low–high-z mismatch removes only a smooth trend in\r
(w0, wa) fits when using the DESY5 SNe sample [51]. For\r
the BAO analysis, DESI DR1 analyses bound template\u0002and reconstruction-induced BAO shifts to 0.1% [52]. All\r
of these effects vary smoothly with redshift: they can tilt\r
or raise the whole w(z) curve but cannot produce the\r
alternating-sign wiggles we recover. The feature there\u0002fore remains most naturally interpreted as evidence for\r
genuine dark-energy dynamics.\r
In conclusion, our study finds tentative evidence for de\u0002partures from ΛCDM using the DESI DR2 data. While\r
our results favor a dynamical dark energy interpreta\u0002tion, continued observational and theoretical efforts will\r
be critical in establishing whether these deviations sig\u0002nify new physics or stem from unknown systematics. The\r
complete DESI sample, with increased statistical depth\r
and extended redshift coverage, is expected to yield even\r
stricter constraints on dark energy evolution. Additional\r
surveys, such as Euclid [53] and the Prime Focus Spec\u0002trograph (PFS) [54], will deliver complementary BAO\r
and large-scale structure measurements, enabling cross\u0002validation of DESI results. Likewise, next-generation\r
CMB projects will improve knowledge of early-universe\r
physics, strengthening the overall dark energy picture.\r
VI. METHODS\r
A. Datasets and priors\r
DESI at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona\r
marks a significant step forward in Stage IV large-scale\r
structure surveys [55, 56]. Designed with a 3.2\r
◦ diame\u0002ter prime focus corrector [57], DESI deploys 5,000 fibers\r
[58] via a robotic focal plane assembly [59] to simulta\u0002neously measure multiple spectra. These hardware capa\u0002bilities are bolstered by a high-throughput spectroscopic\r
data processing pipeline [60] and an efficient operations\r
plan [61]. Since beginning operations in 2021, DESI has\r
been gathering high-fidelity spectra for numerous target\r
classes—Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS; 0.1 < z < 0.4)\r
[62], Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs; 0.4 < z < 1.1)\r
[63], Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs; 1.1 < z < 1.6) [64],\r
Quasars (QSOs; 0.8 < z < 2.1) [65], and the Lyman-α\r
Forest (1.77 < z < 4.16) [66]. Early data analyses and\r
survey validation [56, 67] confirmed that DESI satisfies\r
the performance benchmarks required for a Stage IV sur\u0002vey, advancing our grasp of dark energy’s role in cosmic\r
expansion [55].\r
DESI’s DR1 spans observations from May 14, 2021, to\r
June 14, 2022 [23], and has already yielded new insights\r
into dark energy by detecting the baryon acoustic oscil\u0002lation (BAO) signature in galaxy and quasar clustering\r
[52], as well as in the Lyman-α forest [68]. These results\r
fit seamlessly with external data [69], paving the way for\r
more comprehensive analyses that incorporate the full\r
clustering information from the DESI galaxy sample and\r
other tracers [70, 71]. The subsequent DR2, covering ob\u0002servations through April 9, 2024 [24, 25], not only encom\u0002passes the entirety of DR1 but also extends the redshift\r
range and statistical reach of the survey. This expanded\r
dataset offers a critical test of dynamical dark energy: if\r
dark energy truly evolves over cosmic time, the enriched\r
DR2 sample could reveal a more pronounced signature.\r
By comparing DR1 and DR2 results, one can assess both\r
internal consistency and potential evidence for evolving\r
dark energy. This paper contributes to a suite of compan\u0002ion analyses that build on the main cosmological results\r
[25], with related supporting study on dark energy [29]\r
and neutrino constraints [72].\r
Our analysis draws upon three categories of measure\u0002ments: BAO observations from DESI DR1 and DR2\r
[52, 68], SNe samples from PantheonPlus, Union3, and\r
the 5-year DES survey (DESY5), and distance con\u0002straints from the CMB. Because dark energy chiefly af\u0002fects the Universe’s background expansion history, and\r
modeling its perturbations requires additional assump\u0002tions, we focus here on background observables. Specifi\u0002cally, we incorporate the DESI DR1/DR2 BAO measure\u0002ments, SNe luminosity distances, and the Big Bang Nu\u0002cleosynthesis (BBN) prior Ωbh\r
2 = 0.02196±0.00063 [73].

10\r
We also include CMB distance information from Planck\r
PR4 [74], imposing 100 θ∗ = 1.04098 ± 0.00042, where\r
θ∗ ≡ r∗/DM(z∗) is the ratio of the comoving sound hori\u0002zon at recombination r∗ to the transverse comoving dis\u0002tance DM(z∗) [21, 69]. The quantity r∗ is computed using\r
RECFAST [75] within CAMB [76]. As in [69], we inflate the\r
error bar from [74] (column ‘PR4 12.6’ TTTEEE in Ta\u0002ble 5) by 75% to account for potential broadening of θ∗\r
constraints in extended cosmological models.\r
Our baseline dataset comprises DESI BAO mea\u0002surements, the BBN prior on Ωbh\r
2\r
, and the CMB\r
acoustic-scale constraint on θ∗. We then supplement\r
this baseline with each of the three SNe samples in\r
turn: ‘DR1(2)+PantheonPlus’, ‘DR1(2)+Union3’, and\r
‘DR1(2)+DESY5’ for the DES 5-year sample. Each com\u0002bination is analyzed independently to gauge its impact on\r
w(z) constraints.\r
B. The shape functions of dark energy\r
Galaxy surveys measure cosmic distances via\r
(DM/rd, DH/rd) or DV/rd at specific redshifts, where\r
DH ≡ c/H with H being the Hubble expansion rate,\r
and DM the comoving distance. The volume-averaged\r
distance is defined by DV ≡\r
\r
z D2\r
MDH\r
\u00011/3\r
, with z being\r
the redshift, and rd the sound horizon scale. These\r
observations constrain the shape of H(z), which is\r
directly related to dark energy. To link DH and DM, we\r
adopt the parametrization introduced in [77], providing\r
an accurate yet general description of cosmic distances\r
across a wide range of cosmologies:\r
DM(z)\r
Df\r
M(z)\r
R = α0\r
\r
1 + α1x + α2x\r
2 + α3x3 + . . . \u0001\r
,\r
DH(z)\r
Df\r
H(z)\r
R = β0\r
\r
1 + β1x + β2x\r
2 + β3x3 + . . . \u0001\r
, (2)\r
where the superscript (subscript) ‘f’ denotes quanti\u0002ties evaluated in a fiducial ΛCDM model with ΩM =\r
0.3153. The normalization factor R ≡ r\r
f\r
d\r
/rd accounts\r
for discrepancies in the sound horizon scale, and x ≡\r
Df\r
M(z)/DfM(zp)−1, where DM denotes the comoving dis\u0002tance and zp is a pivot redshift for the series expansion.\r
Because DH and DM are interdependent, the coeffi\u0002cients βi follow from αi via\r
β0 = α0\r
\r
1 + α1\r
\u0001\r
, βi = (i + 1) αi + αi+1\r
1 + α1\r
(i > 0). (3)\r
To avoid overfitting, the series expansion is truncated\r
once the uncertainty in any αi exceeds unity. For\r
DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data, a cutoff at i = 3 (yielding\r
four α parameters) proves adequate.\r
Given the values of α, one can construct the following\r
function [48, 49]:\r
S(a) ≡ A H2(a) a\r
3 = B X(a) a3 + C, (4)\r
where A, B, and C are constants, and X(a) ≡\r
ρDE(a)/ρDE(1) is the normalized dark energy den\u0002sity. Since S(a) shares the same functional form as\r
ρDE(a)—up to a shift and overall rescaling—this ‘shape\r
function’ effectively encodes the potential dynamical\r
properties of dark energy.\r
Specifically, we define three dimensionless functions\r
that offer clear diagnostics for dark energy evolution:\r
S0(a) ≡ a\r
3 −\r

S′(1) = a\r

where derivatives are taken with respect to ln a. Here,\r
PDE(a) and w(a) denote the pressure and equation of\r
state of dark energy, respectively, and the arrows indicate\r
their expected values under ΛCDM.\r
C. A non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of\r
dark energy with the Horndeski prior\r
Within the w(z) cold dark matter (CDM) framework,\r
w(z) is discretized into N = 29 piecewise-constant seg\u0002ments, w ≡ {w1, w2, . . . , wN }, uniformly spaced in scale\r
factor for z < 2.5. Additionally, an extra ‘wide’ bin\r
wwide = −1 is assigned for z > 2.5 up to recombina\u0002tion. Allowing wwide to vary left it largely unconstrained\r
by our data, and it showed minimal correlations with the\r
other w bins. We therefore fix wwide = −1 for simplicity.\r
Alongside these wi, we vary several cosmological param\u0002eters: ΩM, the current fractional matter density; Ωbh\r
2\r
,\r
the physical baryon density; H0, the Hubble constant;\r
and Mb, the absolute SNe magnitude (used only when\r
supernova data are included).\r
We place sufficiently broad flat priors on all param\u0002eters. Specifically, H0 ∈ [20, 100], ΩM ∈ [0.01, 0.99],\r
w0 ∈ [−3, 1], wa ∈ [−3, 2], and wi ∈ [−6, 4] (for i =\r
1, . . . , 29). We explore the resulting parameter space us\u0002ing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm\r
implemented in Cobaya [78]. At each step, we compute a\r
total χ\r
2\r
that combines contributions from both the data\r
and the correlation prior. The prior covariance CΠ is de\u0002rived from Horndeski-based simulations [38] spanning a\r
broad parameter space, as investigated in [38]. Specifi\u0002cally, the prior is defined as,\r
C(a, a′) ≡ ⟨[w(a) − wfid(a)][w(a) − wfid(a\r
′\r
)]⟩\r
=\r
p\r
C(a)C(a\r
′)R(a, a′\r
), (6)\r
where C(a) ≡ C(a, a) and R(a, a′) is the normalised cor\u0002relation function thus equals unity for a = a\r

prior = DTwC\r
−1\r
Π Dw = wT C˜ −1Π w, (8)\r
where Dw = w − wfid = (I − S) w and C˜ −1\r
Π , the in\u0002verse modified covariance matrix of the prior, is defined\r
as C˜ −1\r
Π ≡ (I − S)\r
T C\r
−1\r
Π (I − S). Matrices I and S are the\r
identity matrix and the transformation matrix, respec\u0002tively, and the fiducial model wfid = Sw is calculated by\r
taking a local average of 5 neighboring w bins through\r
the transformation matrix S [35–37, 79]. The factor A\r
balances the strength between data and prior, and we\r
set A = 1 as a default to obtain the main result in Fig.\r
3.\r
We validate our pipeline using mock datasets gener\u0002ated for four input dark energy models with the same\r
data covariance matrix for DESI and SNe measurements,\r
before applying to actual observations. Further technical\r
details are provided in the Supplementary Information.\r
D. The calculation of the Bayesian evidence\r
For a rigorous test of whether the w(z)CDM model\r
is preferred over ΛCDM, we evaluate the Bayesian evi\u0002dence using both PolyChord [80, 81] within Cobaya [78]\r
and an analytic approximation. Under the assumption\r
that both prior and posterior distributions are Gaussian,\r
the evidence E can be computed as [36] lnE = lnV +lnL,\r
where lnV =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
ln det Cpost − ln det C˜\r
prior\u0001\r
. Here, C˜\r
prior\r
and Cpost are the modified correlation-prior covariance\r
and the posterior covariance, respectively, and lnL is the\r
maximum log-likelihood from the data and prior. Be\u0002cause our reconstruction uses a running-average method\r
to specify the fiducial w(z), C˜\r
prior has zero eigenvalues\r
that render its volume ill-defined [35, 36] (see Supple\u0002mentary Information).\r
To address this, we add a diagonal term ∆−2to the\r
prior correlation matrix, interpolating between ΛCDM\r
(∆ = 0) and a w(z)CDM model in which wfid is un\u0002constrained by the correlation prior. The prior volume is\r
controlled by ∆ and, for ∆ < 1, it becomes independent\r
of the flat prior imposed on w in the MCMC analysis.\r
The parameter ∆ changes the effective number of de\u0002grees of freedom, Neff, by controling the strength of the\r
correlation prior.\r
Data availability statement\r
The data used in this analysis will be made pub\u0002lic along the Data Release 2 (details in https://\r

Supplementary Fig. 1. Same as Fig. 3 in the main text, but the blue bands show the reconstruction result with 1 (top) and\r
2 (bottom) effective data modes by using enhanced correlation priors quantified by the A factor. See texts for details.\r
In order to obtain the data modes without using any correlation prior, we need to set A = 0. However, this makes\r
the convergence of MCMC chains impractical. To overcome this problem, we use a Wiener filter projection.\r
Suppose a Fisher matrix of w, denoted as Fdata, can be obtained from a given dataset, and one performs two\r
MCMC reconstructions to obtain w1 and w2 with two sets of modified prior covariance matrices C˜ −1\r
Π,1\r
and C˜ −1\r
Π,2\r
,\r
respectively, then the following relation can be derived using the formulism of the Wiener filter projection [35]:\r

where I is the identity matrix.\r
In practice, we set A = 0.01 to perform a MCMC reconstruction to obtain Cp(A = 0.01), which is the posterior\r
covariance matrix of w, then we can obtain Fdata via\r
Fdata = C−1\r

Supplementary Fig. 2. Reconstructed evolution of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w(z) from SNe, BAO, and\r
combined (SNe+BAO) data. A BBN prior and a CMB measurement of θ∗ are included when BAO measurements are used.\r
The top row (A1, A2, A3) uses BAO data from DESI DR1, while the bottom row (B1, B2, B3) uses BAO data from DESI DR2.\r
From left to right, the columns show SNe data from PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5, respectively. The blue and red shaded\r
regions denote the 68% confidence intervals from SNe-only and BAO-only fits, respectively, and the black hatched regions show\r
the combined SNe+BAO constraints. The black solid line in each panel indicates the best-fit reconstruction for the combined\r
data. The horizontal dotted line at w = −1 corresponds to the value for a cosmological constant.\r
The MCMC also returns the reconstructed w, denoted as wA=0.01. Given Fdata, w1 = wA=0.01 and C˜ −1\r
Π,1 = 0.01C\r
−1\r
Π ,\r
one can in principle reconstruct w for another modified correlation prior by a Wiener filter projection using Eq. (9).\r
One interesting special case is the reconstruction w from data alone, without using any correlation prior. This is\r
straightforward since wdata can be found by setting C˜ −1\r
Π,2 = 0, and the covariance matrix for wdata is simply F\r
−1\r
data.\r
2. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (PCA)\r
PCA is a widely used tool in cosmology to find uncorrelated eigenmodes by diagonalising the associated (inverse)\r
covariance matrix. Specifically,\r
F = WT ΛW, (11)\r
where F is the inverse covariance matrix, W is the decorrelation matrix whose rows are the eigenvectors ei(z), and\r
Λ is a diagonal matrix storing the eigenvalues λi[43]. In this work, we apply PCA for Fdata and C˜ −1\r
Π , respectively,\r
and show the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in Fig. 4.\r
3. COVARIANT PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS (CPCA)\r
CPCA is a variant of PCA with nice features. It allows for finding eigenmodes for both the prior and posterior,\r
therefore it is much easier to quantify the effective degrees of freedom in the system, especially when the prior is\r
complex.

Supplementary Fig. 3. Ratio of the eigenvalues from the prior covariance matrix (CΠ) to those from the posterior covariance\r
matrix (Cp) plotted against the covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) mode number. Each panel corresponds to a\r
different data combination: Top left: BAO alone, Top right: BAO + PantheonPlus, Bottom left: BAO + Union3, and Bottom\r
right: BAO + DESY5. Blue squares represent DESI DR2, while orange circles represent DESI DR1. The Big Bang Nucleosyn\u0002thesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗ are imposed in all cases. Modes for which Cp has smaller\r
eigenvalues than CΠ indicate tighter data constraints relative to the prior.\r
Unlike PCA, the CPCA decomposition is as in [44]:\r
CΠΨ = CpΨL, (12)\r
where the decomposition matrix Ψ and the diagonal matrix L store the CPCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues, respec\u0002tively. The CPCA decomposition, Eq. (12), yields\r
ΨT CpΨ = I,\r
ΨT CΠΨ = L. (13)\r
A ratio of eigenvalues of the prior and posterior matrices, presented in Supplementary Fig. 3, shows how informative\r
the posterior modes are against the prior modes, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff, can be calculated\r
as\r
Neff = N − Tr C\r
−1\r
Π Cp\r
\u0001\r
, (14)\r
where N is the number of nominal parameters. The trace of the diagonal ‘improvement’ matrix L, denoted as\r
T ≡ Tr(L), quantifies the constraining power, and thus is a useful metric for a comparison among different datasets.\r
Supplementary Table 4 shows Neff, T and the significance of deviation of w(z)CDM model from three models (in\r
terms of the improved χ\r
2\r
) as illustrated in the table. Results are shown for four datasets.

(Dated: September 22, 2025)\r
Understanding whether cosmic acceleration arises from a cosmological constant or a dynamical\r
component is a central goal of cosmology, and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\r
enables stringent tests with high-precision distance measurements. We analyze baryon acoustic oscil\u0002lation (BAO) measurements from DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2), combined\r
with Type Ia supernovae and a cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior. With the larger\r
statistical power and wider redshift coverage of DR2, the preference for dynamical dark energy does\r
not diminish relative to DR1. Using both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric ap\u0002proaches with a Horndeski-motivated correlation prior, we find that the dark-energy equation of\r
state w(z) varies with redshift. BAO data alone yield modest constraints, but in combination with\r
independent supernova compilations and the CMB prior they strengthen the evidence for dynamics.\r
Bayesian model comparison shows moderate support for departures from ΛCDM when multiple\r
degrees of freedom in w(z) are allowed, corresponding to ≈ 3σ tension with ΛCDM (and higher\r
for some data sets). Despite methodological differences, our results are consistent with companion\r
DESI papers, underscoring the complementarity of approaches. Possible systematics remain under\r
study; forthcoming DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB data will provide decisive tests.\r

I. INTRODUCTION\r
One of the most enduring puzzles in modern cosmology\r
is the accelerating expansion of the Universe. The impe\u0002tus for introducing an additional component beyond or\u0002dinary matter first arose in the 1980s, when early cosmic\r
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy calculations\r
showed that a low-density open model would conflict with

3\r
small-scale CMB observations. Subsequently, large-scale\r
clustering analyses [1] and baryon-fraction arguments [2]\r
made it clear that a Universe consisting solely of critical\u0002density dark matter was untenable, prompting the emer\u0002gence of a cosmological constant (Λ) as the leading expla\u0002nation. Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe) then\r
provided direct evidence for an accelerating cosmic ex\u0002pansion [3, 4], and by the turn of the millennium, the\r
ΛCDM framework was firmly established as the consen\u0002sus model of cosmology. This paradigm has been contin\u0002uously supported by increasingly precise CMB measure\u0002ments [5] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data [6],\r
solidifying its status as the standard picture of cosmic ac\u0002celeration.\r
Despite this consensus, the fundamental cause of cos\u0002mic acceleration remains elusive. A widely favored in\u0002terpretation involves postulating an effective dark en\u0002ergy (DE) component that dominates the current energy\r
density of the Universe (see [7–9] for reviews). Provided\r
its sound speed is not too small, DE can be treated as\r
nearly homogeneous on sub-sound-horizon scales, leaving\r
its main cosmological signatures determined by its energy\r
density ρ and pressure P. The equation of state (EoS),\r
w ≡ P/c2ρ, serves as a crucial diagnostic: w = −1 cor\u0002responds to vacuum energy, while dynamical DE models\r
allow w to vary with time, as exemplified by quintessence\r
[10], phantom [11], quintom [12], k-essence [13], Chaply\u0002gin gas [14], and holographic dark energy [15]. Subclasses\r
of these scenarios can be further differentiated by exam\u0002ining their trajectories in the phase space spanned by\r
\r
w, dw/d ln a\r
\u0001\r
, where a is the cosmic scale factor [16].\r
Recent observational progress, including supernova\r
measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) [17],\r
as well as other large SNe compilations such as Pan\u0002theonPlus [18, 19] and Union [20], high-precision CMB\r
data from the Planck Collaboration [21], and BAO results\r
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) eBOSS pro\u0002gram [22], has significantly refined our insight into DE.\r
These complementary probes constrain DE-related pa\u0002rameters with growing precision, thus enhancing our un\u0002derstanding of cosmic acceleration. While combined anal\u0002yses that integrate all available datasets provide the most\r
stringent overall limits, it remains instructive to consider\r
each probe in isolation. Such a modular approach not\r
only underscores the unique strengths and systematics of\r
each measurement but also furnishes critical cross-checks,\r
reinforcing the robustness of DE constraints.\r
The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)’s\r
Data Release 1 (DR1) [23] and Data Release 2 (DR2)\r
[24, 25] BAO observations place stringent limits on the\r
Universe’s background expansion history, achieving a\r
level of precision on a par with recent SNe surveys. These\r
include the PantheonPlus compilation of 1,550 spectro\u0002scopically confirmed SNe [18, 19], the Union3 compilation\r
of 2,087 SNe [20], and the five-year Dark Energy Survey\r
sample (DESY5) [17].\r
In this paper we probe dark-energy dynamics along two\r
complementary routes. First, we fit the distance ladder\r
with a shape-function formalism that makes no explicit\r
assumption about the equation of state. Secondly, we\r
carry out a fully Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) in which\r
a correlation prior derived from the Horndeski gravity\r
[26] yields an interpretable Bayes factor, recovering the\r
standard (w0, wa) result [27, 28] with two effective de\u0002grees of freedom. Although these techniques differ from\r
the Gaussian-process and (w0, wa) analyses presented in\r
the companion DESI studies [25, 29], all approaches paint\r
a coherent picture: DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO measure\u0002ments, together with three different Type Ia supernova\r
samples, indicate the same mild, oscillatory departure\r
from a cosmological constant. The convergence of results\r
across data sets and methodologies strengthens the sta\u0002tistical case for an evolving dark energy component.\r
II. A SHAPE-FUNCTION ANALYSIS OF DARK\r
ENERGY\r
The shape function S0(a) illustrates how dark energy\r
grows relative to matter, and the function S1(a) re\u0002veals whether and how the dark energy pressure changes\r
with time. Finally, S2(a)—often referred to as the ‘state\u0002finder’ parameter [30, 31]—encodes both w(a) and its\r
derivative, making it particularly useful for distinguish\u0002ing among dark energy models (See Methods for the de\u0002fination and more details of the shape functions). For\r
example, a ‘freezing’ quintessence scenario predicts S2 <\r
−1 [32], whereas barotropic fluid models require S2 > −1\r
[33]. If S2 crosses the −1 threshold during cosmic evolu\u0002tion, it may indicate that multiple dark energy compo\u0002nents dominate at different epochs.\r
Fig. 1 displays the reconstructed S functions derived\r
from DESI BAO and three SNe datasets, based on\r
Eqs. (2)–(5). All panels reveal a systematic deviation\r
from the ΛCDM baseline, and this pattern of deviation\r
is consistent across the four datasets, indicating a shared\r
underlying trend.\r
A key point is that the DESI DR2 sample uncovers a\r
stronger dynamical DE signal than DESI DR1. In partic\u0002ular, S0 and S1 both lie systematically above the ΛCDM\r
expectation in DR2, pointing to a more pronounced de\u0002parture from a pure cosmological constant. Even more\r
notably, S2 in DR2 exhibits a sharper crossing behavior\r
relative to DR1, suggesting that the observed expansion\r
may not be fully described by standard ΛCDM.\r
This amplified crossing, coupled with smaller uncer\u0002tainties, bolsters the case for dark energy possessing\r
additional internal degrees of freedom. Further rein\u0002forcing this conclusion, the DR2-based reconstructions\r
closely match those obtained from three independent\r
SNe samples. Their broad consistency indicates that\r
these deviations probably reflect real dynamical evo\u0002lution of the dark energy; for this not to be the case,\r
a number of different systematics would all need to\r
conspire in the same direction. Although DR2 provides\r
stronger statistical evidence overall, uncertainties remain

significant at z ≳ 0.5, limiting definitive conclusions\r
at higher redshifts. Even so, the alignment between\r
DESI DR2 and SNe data underscores the importance of\r
forthcoming high-precision measurements for clarifying\r
the fundamental nature and potential evolution of dark\r
energy.\r
III. EVOLUTION OF THE EQUATION OF\r
STATE\r
To explore this further, we adopt the commonly used\r
w0–wa parameterization [27, 28], in which the dark en\u0002ergy equation of state is written as w(a) = w0 + wa (1 −\r
a). Here, w0 is the present-day equation-of-state value,\r
while wa describes how w evolves with redshift. Notably,\r
ΛCDM is recovered by setting w0 = −1 and wa = 0.\r
Fitting this model to the data constrains the possible\r
dynamical nature of dark energy in a simple yet effec\u0002tive manner. Moreover, the w0–wa approach serves as a\r
bridge between the shape-function reconstructions and\r
the fully non-parametric w(z) methods discussed later,\r
offering an intermediate step toward more general dark\r
energy modeling.\r
Fig. 2 shows the inferred constraints on (w0, wa) for\r
different data combinations (See Methods for datasets\r
and priors used). The left panel corresponds to DESI\r
DR1, while the right panel presents DR2. Contour colors\r
indicate various datasets, with inner and outer contours\r
marking 1σ and 2σ confidence intervals, respectively. We\r
divide the parameter space into four dark energy models:\r
Quintessence (w > −1 at all epochs, thus w0 > −1 and\r
w0+wa > −1) [10], Full Phantom (w < −1 at all epochs,\r
thus w0 < −1 and w0 + wa < −1) [11], Quintom A\r
(w > −1 in the past but w < −1 today, thus w0 < −1\r
and w0 + wa > −1) [12], and Quintom B (w < −1 in the\r
past but w > −1 today, thus w0 > −1 and w0+wa < −1)\r
[12].\r
Using only DESI DR1 BAO measurements yields con\u0002straints that are broadly consistent with ΛCDM, albeit\r
with mild (∼ 1.5–2σ) hints of departure. Incorporating\r
supernova data narrows these contours further, indicat\u0002ing a slight preference for dynamical dark energy. A sim\u0002ilar pattern emerges from the DR2-only analysis, which\r
achieves notably tighter constraints than DR1 and favors

evidence peaks at “moderate” support for dynamical w(z) once SNe are included. The strength of this prior is varied by adding\r
different values of ∆ to its diagonal. For comparison, we show both the analytically estimated ln E (calculated as ln L + ln V )\r
and the numerically computed values obtained via Polychord. The top panel presents results derived using DESI DR1 BAO\r
data, while the bottom panel corresponds to DESI DR2. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the\r

w0 > −1 with wa < 0, consistent with a Quintom B-like\r
scenario. Even so, ΛCDM remains viable at ∼ 1.5σ. This\r
is weaker than the 2.3σ rejection of ΛCDM in [25] from\r
DESI+CMB, because our CMB prior uses only part of\r
the information, and also because we have chosen to in\u0002flate uncertainties. When DR2 is combined with super\u0002nova data, the best-fit values stay in the Quintom B re\u0002gion, pushing the tension with ΛCDM above 2σ, showing\r
somewhat stronger preference for departure from a sim\u0002ple cosmological constant (see Supplementary Tables 1\r
and 2 for more details).\r
To delve deeper into the dynamical nature of dark en\u0002ergy, we perform a non-parametric Bayesian reconstruc\u0002tion of w(z) using the correlation-prior framework orig\u0002inally proposed in [34, 35] and subsequently applied in\r
[36, 37]. In this methodology, w(z) is treated as a free\r
function, while a correlation prior enforces smoothness\r
and mitigates flat directions in the likelihood. The corre\u0002lation prior itself can be motivated by theoretical consid\u0002erations [38]; here, we adopt the version derived in [38]\r
from Horndeski theory [26] (See Methods for details of\r
the reconstruction).\r
Fig. 3 (white curves and blue bands) illustrates the\r
best-fit and 68% CL constraints on w(z) obtained from\r
various data combinations. The upper row corresponds\r
to DESI DR1 BAO data, and the lower row to DR2.\r
In each row, the leftmost panel reports BAO-only con\u0002straints, while the other panels incorporate additional su\u0002pernova datasets: PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5. In\r
all cases, w(z) ̸= −1 is clearly indicated. Throughout the\r
paper, we define the significance (i.e., the signal-to-noise\r
ratio, SNR) of the reconstructed w(z) deviating from a\r
specific model wmod via\r
SNR2 ≡ (w − wmod)\r
T C−1\r
w (w − wmod), (1)\r
where Cw is the posterior covariance for the w bins. For\r
the DR1-based reconstructions (panels A1–A4), the SNR\r
of w ̸= −1 is 2.6, 3.9, 3.9, and 4.2, respectively. Switch\u0002ing to the DR2 dataset yields comparable significance at\r
2.6, 3.7, 4.3, and 4.5, respectively. It is interesting that\r
the preference for deviations from ΛCDM when the SNe\r
samples are included remained strong with the enhanced\r
statistical power of DESI DR2.\r
All dataset combinations exhibit a persistent pattern\r
in w(z): w > −1 at z ≲ 0.2 and w < −1 at z ∼ 0.75,\r
which is consistent with the results reported in com\u0002panion DESI papers [25, 29]. Including supernova data\r
highlights this feature further, revealing pronounced os\u0002cillations in w(z). These patterns remain stable and gain\r
additional significance when DR1 BAO is replaced by\r
DR2. In fact, oscillatory or non-monotonic w(z) evolution\r
arises naturally in several classes of dark energy models\r
– including axion-like quintessence scenarios with peri\u0002odic potentials [39], interacting dark sector frameworks,\r
where energy exchange between dark energy and dark\r
matter can induce transient oscillations in w [40, 41],\r
and multi-field quintom constructions that allow w(z)\r
to cross the −1 threshold and back [12, 42]. Crucially,\r
the oscillatory feature seen in our reconstruction is not\r
an artifact of any single dataset: it appears consistently\r
across different Type Ia supernova samples and remains\r
essentially unchanged when the BAO dataset is upgraded\r
from DESI DR1 to DR2. This stability across indepen\u0002dent data sets and updated observations reinforces the\r
interpretation that the observed oscillations in w(z) are\r
a robust physical signal, potentially pointing toward an\r
underlying dynamical dark energy component consistent\r
with the aforementioned model classes.\r
The green bands—reconstructions using the CPL pa\u0002rameterization—track the transition across w = −1 well\r
and are broadly compatible with the non-parametric re\u0002sults, reinforcing the robustness of these conclusions.\r
While the significance of w ̸= −1 stems from the re\u0002duction in χ\r
2\r
relative to ΛCDM, fully assessing the fit\r
also requires determining the effective degrees of freedom\r
(DoF) in the reconstructed w(z). This step is nontrivial\r
because the correlation prior couples the w(z) bins. To\r
address this, we perform a principal component analysis\r
(PCA) [43] to decorrelate the prior and posterior inverse\r
covariance matrices of w(z). Further technical details on\r
the PCA procedure can be found in the Supplementary\r
Information.\r
Fig. 4 shows the PCA results for the reconstructed dark\r
energy equation of state w(z). The left panels (A1–A4)\r
plot the eigenvectors of the first few well-constrained\r
modes, highlighting their redshift dependence, while the\r
right panels (B1–B4) display the corresponding eigen\u0002values λi for different dataset combinations. The PCA\r
identifies independent modes constrained by the data.\r
In panel A1 (BAO-only), the first principal component\r
(PC1) is smooth and relatively featureless, indicating\r
that BAO data alone primarily constrain a single domi\u0002nant mode of w(z). By contrast, adding supernova data\r
(panels A2–A4) produces additional constrained modes;\r
PC2 and PC3 become more oscillatory, especially at low\r
redshift, demonstrating that supernova observations sig\u0002nificantly improve constraints on the redshift evolution\r
of w(z). Because the main feature of w(z) is effectively a\r
linear combination of these three modes, further progress\r
will come from shrinking the PC1 error bar through im\u0002proved low-z SN calibration, tightening PC2 and PC3\r
with denser distance tracers in the 0.3 < z < 0.8 window,\r
and extending observations to z ≳ 0.8 to assess whether\r
additional PCs are required.\r
The right panels show the eigenvalues λi, which quan\u0002tify the statistical significance of each mode (larger val\u0002ues correspond to tighter constraints). In panel B1 (also\r
BAO-only), four eigenvalue notably exceeds that of the\r
correlation prior (green curve). When supernova datasets\r
are incorporated (panels B2–B4), more modes become\r
well constrained. Comparing DESI Data Release 1 (DR1;\r
orange) and Data Release 2 (DR2; blue) eigenvalues re\u0002veals that DR2 consistently achieves larger eigenvalues\r
for the constrained modes, indicating stronger statistical\r
power in the DR2 sample. This gain is most evident when\r
supernova data are included, as the gap between the first

8\r
few eigenvalues of DR1 and DR2 widens, showing that\r
DR2 improves constraints across multiple modes of w(z).\r
We further validate these findings by computing the effec\u0002tive number of degrees of freedom Neff numerically with\r
covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) [44], de\u0002tailed in the Supplementary Information. The CPCA re\u0002sults align with the PCA, confirming the robustness of\r
our assessment of how many independent modes of w(z)\r
are constrained by the data.\r
We can project w(z) onto the PC eigenmodes 1 +\r
w(z) = P\r
i\r
γiei(z) where the corresponding eigenvalue λi\r
of the covariance matrix represents the error of the am\u0002plitude γi\r
, λi = 1/σ2(γi). Supplementary Table 5 shows\r
the amplitude of the first five PCs. Considering the case\r
with DR2 and DR1/DR2 + SNe, the amplitude of the\r
first PC is positive, indicating that this mode describes\r
a behavior of w(z) that increases from −1 over time.\r
The improvement in the fits, ∆χ\r
2 = −\r
P\r
i\r
[γi/σ(γi)]2, is\r
dominated by PC1. Including higher-order PCs, multiple\r
crossings of w = −1 occur, as we observe in the recon\u0002structed w(z) shown in Fig. 3. In the case of DR2 + SNe,\r

that the dependence of the reconstructed w(z) on the\r
correlation prior is explicit. To demonstrate this, we\r
deliberately change the amplitude of the correlation\r
prior, A, and impose a stronger prior to avoid possible\r
overfitting. By tuning A, the effective number of degrees\r

that we obtained based on the w0-wa parametrization as\r

IV. BAYESIAN EVIDENCE AND EVOLUTION\r
We evaluate the evidence against ΛCDM analytically\r
and numerically (see Methods for details), as illustrated\r
in Fig. 5. Consistent with expectations, ln L grows while\r
ln V decreases monotonically with increasing ∆ (or Neff),\r
which reflects the number of modes in w(z) that remain\r
after applying the correlation prior. The analytic and\r
numerical evidence estimates typically agree, except in\r
BAO-only scenarios, where the data are not sufficiently\r
constraining to maintain Gaussianity in the posterior.\r
Fig. 5 plots the model evidence and related quantities\r
versus ∆, with the effective degrees of freedom Neff noted\r
on the top axis. The top panels show DESI DR1 re\u0002sults, and the bottom panels DESI DR2. We display the\r
change in log-likelihood ∆ ln L (blue squares), the an\u0002alytic ∆ ln E (orange circles), the numerical ∆ ln E (red\r
points), and the change in log-prior volume ∆ ln V (green\r
diamonds).\r
The increase in both ∆ ln E and the signal-to-noise ra\u0002tio (SNR) for detecting w ̸= −1 with larger Neff fur\u0002ther supports the idea that adding extra degrees of free\u0002dom favors a dynamical dark energy interpretation over\r
a pure cosmological constant. When using BAO data\r
alone, ∆ ln E remains consistent with zero for all Neff,\r
confirming that BAO measurements by themselves offer\r
limited evidence against ΛCDM. In contrast, once super\u0002nova datasets are added, ∆ ln E rises substantially. For\r
instance, DR1 + DESY5 yields a peak ∆ ln E of 4.1±0.6\r
(classified as “Moderate” on Jeffreys’ scale [45–47]) at\r
Neff = 2, increasing to 5.2 ± 0.7 (also “Moderate”) for\r
DR2 + DESY5 at Neff = 3. A similar pattern emerges\r
with BAO + Union3: the evidence systematically in\u0002creases from DR1 to DR2, reaching 3.3 ± 0.7 (“Moder\u0002ate”) at Neff = 3 for DR2.\r
By contrast, BAO + PantheonPlus shows weaker ev\u0002idence, changing only slightly from DR1 to DR2, with\r
∆ ln E peaking at 1.5±0.6 (“Weak”) in DR1 and 1.4±0.7\r
(“Weak”) in DR2—consistent with what is seen under\r
the CPL parameterization. Although the PantheonPlus\r
dataset alone can show a mild preference for w ̸= −1\r
(see Supplementary Fig. 2), combining it with BAO data\r
partially cancels that signal. One possibility is a mild\r
tension between the PantheonPlus-inferred distance scale\r
and the BAO-preferred expansion history, pushing the\r
joint constraints closer to ΛCDM. Further investigation\r
is needed to determine whether this is attributable to\r
systematics.\r
To gauge the strongest possible deviation from w = −1\r
without overfitting the data, we look at w(z)CDM mod\u0002els with the largest departure from ΛCDM while still\r
having a positive evidence, ı.e. ∆ ln E ≥ 0. Under this\r
condition, the significance of w ̸= −1 for BAO + DESY5\r
reaches 4.1 (DR1) and 4.3 (DR2). For BAO + Union3,\r
the corresponding values are 3.8 (DR1) and 3.9 (DR2).\r
Meanwhile, BAO + PantheonPlus yields maximum\r
SNRs of 3.2 (DR1) and 3.1 (DR2), reinforcing the prior\r
finding that PantheonPlus offers comparatively weaker\r
support for w ̸= −1 than either Union3 or DESY5.\r
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\r
With the start of the DESI survey, we now have ac\u0002cess to exceptionally precise BAO measurements, pro\u0002viding a robust tool to probe the nature of dark energy.\r
In this work, we analyzed DESI DR2 BAO observations\r
in tandem with complementary cosmic distance indica\u0002tors— SNe data and the CMB acoustic scale θ∗—to test\r
for deviations from the ΛCDM paradigm. Employing a\r
shape-function approach [48, 49], we derived key observ\u0002ables sensitive to dark energy (DE) and found consistent\r
evidence for an evolving equation of state w(z) across\r
multiple, independent datasets.\r
Building on these findings, we performed a non\u0002parametric Bayesian reconstruction of w(z) by jointly\r
analyzing DESI BAO, SNe, and CMB data, employing a\r
correlation prior rooted in Horndeski theory. Our results\r
exhibit strong statistical support for dynamical dark en-

9\r
ergy, at a confidence level exceeding 3σ. Rigorous model\r
selection further indicates that DESI BAO, SNe, and\r
CMB observations together constrain roughly three inde\u0002pendent degrees of freedom (DoFs) without overfitting.\r
In particular, combining DESI BAO, CMB, and the five\u0002year DES supernova sample detects dark energy evolu\u0002tion at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.9, with a Bayesian evi\u0002dence of 5.2±0.7 in favor of w(z)CDM over ΛCDM when\r
Neff = 3.\r
These results suggest that dark energy may not be\r
described by a simple cosmological constant, favoring a\r
time-dependent equation of state w(z) instead. Although\r
earlier work [37] hinted at similar conclusions, this study\r
provides some of the tightest constraints to date, thanks\r
in large part to the enhanced statistical power of DESI\r
DR2 BAO data. Furthermore, adding supernova datasets\r
significantly boosts sensitivity to potential dark energy\r
evolution: all three independent SN samples (Pantheon\u0002Plus, Union3, and DESY5) show broadly consistent in\u0002dications of deviations from ΛCDM.\r
Companion DESI papers [25, 29] investigate the time\r
evolution of dark energy using complementary methods,\r
and also report the detection of the dynamical dark en\u0002ergy. The level of significance is generally greater in those\r
works because the full Planck measurements are used\r
there, as opposed to the θ∗ information used in this\r
work. Moreover, the recent Atacama Cosmology Tele\u0002scope (ACT) results find that the time evolution of dark\r
energy is still favored when replacing the Planck data\r
with the ACT measurements [50].\r
Extensive cross-checks indicate that known system\u0002atics cannot mimic the oscillatory pattern in Fig. 3.\r
Photometric offsets and a possible evolution of the\r
colour–luminosity relation in PantheonPlus can shift\r
w(z) by about 0.03 at z ≲ 0.4 [19], and the 0.04 mag\r
low–high-z mismatch removes only a smooth trend in\r
(w0, wa) fits when using the DESY5 SNe sample [51]. For\r
the BAO analysis, DESI DR1 analyses bound template\u0002and reconstruction-induced BAO shifts to 0.1% [52]. All\r
of these effects vary smoothly with redshift: they can tilt\r
or raise the whole w(z) curve but cannot produce the\r
alternating-sign wiggles we recover. The feature there\u0002fore remains most naturally interpreted as evidence for\r
genuine dark-energy dynamics.\r
In conclusion, our study finds tentative evidence for de\u0002partures from ΛCDM using the DESI DR2 data. While\r
our results favor a dynamical dark energy interpreta\u0002tion, continued observational and theoretical efforts will\r
be critical in establishing whether these deviations sig\u0002nify new physics or stem from unknown systematics. The\r
complete DESI sample, with increased statistical depth\r
and extended redshift coverage, is expected to yield even\r
stricter constraints on dark energy evolution. Additional\r
surveys, such as Euclid [53] and the Prime Focus Spec\u0002trograph (PFS) [54], will deliver complementary BAO\r
and large-scale structure measurements, enabling cross\u0002validation of DESI results. Likewise, next-generation\r
CMB projects will improve knowledge of early-universe\r
physics, strengthening the overall dark energy picture.\r
VI. METHODS\r
A. Datasets and priors\r
DESI at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona\r
marks a significant step forward in Stage IV large-scale\r
structure surveys [55, 56]. Designed with a 3.2\r
◦ diame\u0002ter prime focus corrector [57], DESI deploys 5,000 fibers\r
[58] via a robotic focal plane assembly [59] to simulta\u0002neously measure multiple spectra. These hardware capa\u0002bilities are bolstered by a high-throughput spectroscopic\r
data processing pipeline [60] and an efficient operations\r
plan [61]. Since beginning operations in 2021, DESI has\r
been gathering high-fidelity spectra for numerous target\r
classes—Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS; 0.1 < z < 0.4)\r
[62], Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs; 0.4 < z < 1.1)\r
[63], Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs; 1.1 < z < 1.6) [64],\r
Quasars (QSOs; 0.8 < z < 2.1) [65], and the Lyman-α\r
Forest (1.77 < z < 4.16) [66]. Early data analyses and\r
survey validation [56, 67] confirmed that DESI satisfies\r
the performance benchmarks required for a Stage IV sur\u0002vey, advancing our grasp of dark energy’s role in cosmic\r
expansion [55].\r
DESI’s DR1 spans observations from May 14, 2021, to\r
June 14, 2022 [23], and has already yielded new insights\r
into dark energy by detecting the baryon acoustic oscil\u0002lation (BAO) signature in galaxy and quasar clustering\r
[52], as well as in the Lyman-α forest [68]. These results\r
fit seamlessly with external data [69], paving the way for\r
more comprehensive analyses that incorporate the full\r
clustering information from the DESI galaxy sample and\r
other tracers [70, 71]. The subsequent DR2, covering ob\u0002servations through April 9, 2024 [24, 25], not only encom\u0002passes the entirety of DR1 but also extends the redshift\r
range and statistical reach of the survey. This expanded\r
dataset offers a critical test of dynamical dark energy: if\r
dark energy truly evolves over cosmic time, the enriched\r
DR2 sample could reveal a more pronounced signature.\r
By comparing DR1 and DR2 results, one can assess both\r
internal consistency and potential evidence for evolving\r
dark energy. This paper contributes to a suite of compan\u0002ion analyses that build on the main cosmological results\r
[25], with related supporting study on dark energy [29]\r
and neutrino constraints [72].\r
Our analysis draws upon three categories of measure\u0002ments: BAO observations from DESI DR1 and DR2\r
[52, 68], SNe samples from PantheonPlus, Union3, and\r
the 5-year DES survey (DESY5), and distance con\u0002straints from the CMB. Because dark energy chiefly af\u0002fects the Universe’s background expansion history, and\r
modeling its perturbations requires additional assump\u0002tions, we focus here on background observables. Specifi\u0002cally, we incorporate the DESI DR1/DR2 BAO measure\u0002ments, SNe luminosity distances, and the Big Bang Nu\u0002cleosynthesis (BBN) prior Ωbh\r

ρDE(a)/ρDE(1) is the normalized dark energy den\u0002sity. Since S(a) shares the same functional form as\r
ρDE(a)—up to a shift and overall rescaling—this ‘shape\r
function’ effectively encodes the potential dynamical\r
properties of dark energy.\r

C. A non-parametric Bayesian reconstruction of\r
dark energy with the Horndeski prior\r
Within the w(z) cold dark matter (CDM) framework,\r
w(z) is discretized into N = 29 piecewise-constant seg\u0002ments, w ≡ {w1, w2, . . . , wN }, uniformly spaced in scale\r
factor for z < 2.5. Additionally, an extra ‘wide’ bin\r
wwide = −1 is assigned for z > 2.5 up to recombina\u0002tion. Allowing wwide to vary left it largely unconstrained\r
by our data, and it showed minimal correlations with the\r
other w bins. We therefore fix wwide = −1 for simplicity.\r
Alongside these wi, we vary several cosmological param\u0002eters: ΩM, the current fractional matter density; Ωbh\r
2\r
,\r
the physical baryon density; H0, the Hubble constant;\r
and Mb, the absolute SNe magnitude (used only when\r
supernova data are included).\r
We place sufficiently broad flat priors on all param\u0002eters. Specifically, H0 ∈ [20, 100], ΩM ∈ [0.01, 0.99],\r
w0 ∈ [−3, 1], wa ∈ [−3, 2], and wi ∈ [−6, 4] (for i =\r
1, . . . , 29). We explore the resulting parameter space us\u0002ing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm\r
implemented in Cobaya [78]. At each step, we compute a\r
total χ\r
2\r
that combines contributions from both the data\r
and the correlation prior. The prior covariance CΠ is de\u0002rived from Horndeski-based simulations [38] spanning a\r
broad parameter space, as investigated in [38]. Specifi\u0002cally, the prior is defined as,\r
C(a, a′) ≡ ⟨[w(a) − wfid(a)][w(a) − wfid(a\r
′\r
)]⟩\r
=\r
p\r
C(a)C(a\r
′)R(a, a′\r
), (6)\r
where C(a) ≡ C(a, a) and R(a, a′) is the normalised cor\u0002relation function thus equals unity for a = a\r
′\r
. The func\u0002tional form of the correlation prior used in this work is\r
taken from [38]:\r

Π , the in\u0002verse modified covariance matrix of the prior, is defined\r
as C˜ −1\r
Π ≡ (I − S)\r
T C\r

Π (I − S). Matrices I and S are the\r
identity matrix and the transformation matrix, respec\u0002tively, and the fiducial model wfid = Sw is calculated by\r
taking a local average of 5 neighboring w bins through\r
the transformation matrix S [35–37, 79]. The factor A\r
balances the strength between data and prior, and we\r
set A = 1 as a default to obtain the main result in Fig.\r
3.\r
We validate our pipeline using mock datasets gener\u0002ated for four input dark energy models with the same\r
data covariance matrix for DESI and SNe measurements,\r
before applying to actual observations. Further technical\r
details are provided in the Supplementary Information.\r
D. The calculation of the Bayesian evidence\r
For a rigorous test of whether the w(z)CDM model\r
is preferred over ΛCDM, we evaluate the Bayesian evi\u0002dence using both PolyChord [80, 81] within Cobaya [78]\r
and an analytic approximation. Under the assumption\r
that both prior and posterior distributions are Gaussian,\r
the evidence E can be computed as [36] lnE = lnV +lnL,\r
where lnV =\r
1\r
2\r
\r
ln det Cpost − ln det C˜\r
prior\u0001\r
. Here, C˜\r
prior\r
and Cpost are the modified correlation-prior covariance\r
and the posterior covariance, respectively, and lnL is the\r
maximum log-likelihood from the data and prior. Be\u0002cause our reconstruction uses a running-average method\r
to specify the fiducial w(z), C˜\r
prior has zero eigenvalues\r
that render its volume ill-defined [35, 36] (see Supple\u0002mentary Information).\r
To address this, we add a diagonal term ∆−2to the\r
prior correlation matrix, interpolating between ΛCDM\r
(∆ = 0) and a w(z)CDM model in which wfid is un\u0002constrained by the correlation prior. The prior volume is\r
controlled by ∆ and, for ∆ < 1, it becomes independent\r
of the flat prior imposed on w in the MCMC analysis.\r
The parameter ∆ changes the effective number of de\u0002grees of freedom, Neff, by controling the strength of the\r
correlation prior.\r
Data availability statement\r

Supplementary Fig. 1. Same as Fig. 3 in the main text, but the blue bands show the reconstruction result with 1 (top) and\r
2 (bottom) effective data modes by using enhanced correlation priors quantified by the A factor. See texts for details.\r
In order to obtain the data modes without using any correlation prior, we need to set A = 0. However, this makes\r
the convergence of MCMC chains impractical. To overcome this problem, we use a Wiener filter projection.\r
Suppose a Fisher matrix of w, denoted as Fdata, can be obtained from a given dataset, and one performs two\r
MCMC reconstructions to obtain w1 and w2 with two sets of modified prior covariance matrices C˜ −1\r
Π,1\r
and C˜ −1\r

where I is the identity matrix.\r

covariance matrix of w, then we can obtain Fdata via\r

The top row (A1, A2, A3) uses BAO data from DESI DR1, while the bottom row (B1, B2, B3) uses BAO data from DESI DR2.\r
From left to right, the columns show SNe data from PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5, respectively. The blue and red shaded\r

the combined SNe+BAO constraints. The black solid line in each panel indicates the best-fit reconstruction for the combined\r
data. The horizontal dotted line at w = −1 corresponds to the value for a cosmological constant.\r

one can in principle reconstruct w for another modified correlation prior by a Wiener filter projection using Eq. (9).\r
One interesting special case is the reconstruction w from data alone, without using any correlation prior. This is\r

Supplementary Fig. 3. Ratio of the eigenvalues from the prior covariance matrix (CΠ) to those from the posterior covariance\r
matrix (Cp) plotted against the covariant principal component analysis (CPCA) mode number. Each panel corresponds to a\r
different data combination: Top left: BAO alone, Top right: BAO + PantheonPlus, Bottom left: BAO + Union3, and Bottom\r
right: BAO + DESY5. Blue squares represent DESI DR2, while orange circles represent DESI DR1. The Big Bang Nucleosyn\u0002thesis (BBN) priors and constraints on the CMB acoustic scale θ∗ are imposed in all cases. Modes for which Cp has smaller\r
eigenvalues than CΠ indicate tighter data constraints relative to the prior.\r
Unlike PCA, the CPCA decomposition is as in [44]:\r
CΠΨ = CpΨL, (12)\r
where the decomposition matrix Ψ and the diagonal matrix L store the CPCA eigenvectors and eigenvalues, respec\u0002tively. The CPCA decomposition, Eq. (12), yields\r
ΨT CpΨ = I,\r
ΨT CΠΨ = L. (13)\r
A ratio of eigenvalues of the prior and posterior matrices, presented in Supplementary Fig. 3, shows how informative\r
the posterior modes are against the prior modes, and the effective number of degrees of freedom Neff, can be calculated\r
as\r
Neff = N − Tr C\r

, (14)\r
where N is the number of nominal parameters. The trace of the diagonal ‘improvement’ matrix L, denoted as\r
T ≡ Tr(L), quantifies the constraining power, and thus is a useful metric for a comparison among different datasets.\r
Supplementary Table 4 shows Neff, T and the significance of deviation of w(z)CDM model from three models (in\r
terms of the improved χ\r
