In the context of real-space renormalization group methods, we propose a novel scheme for quan\u0002tum systems defined on a D-dimensional lattice. It is based on a coarse-graining transformation\r
that attempts to reduce the amount of entanglement of a block of lattice sites before truncating its\r
Hilbert space. Numerical simulations involving the ground state of a 1D system at criticality show\r
that the resulting coarse-grained site requires a Hilbert space dimension that does not grow with\r
successive rescaling transformations. As a result we can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thou\u0002sands of quantum spins with a computational effort that scales logarithmically in the system’s size.\r
The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized\r
in layers corresponding to different length scales. At a quantum critical point, each rellevant length\r
scale makes an equivalent contribution to the entanglement of a block with the rest of the system.\r
PACS numbers:\r
Renormalization, one of the conceptual pillars of sta\u0002tistical mechanics and quantum field theory, revolves\r
around the idea of rescaling transformations of an ex\u0002tended system [1]. These so-called renormalization group\r
(RG) transformations are not only a key theoretical el\u0002ement in the modern formulation of critical phenomena\r
and phase transitions, but also the basis of important\r
computational methods for many-body problems.\r
In the case of quantum systems defined on a lattice,\r
Wilson’s real-space RG methods [2], based on the trun\u0002cation of the Hilbert space, replaced Kadanoff’s spin\u0002blocking ideas [3] with a concise mathematical formu\u0002lation and an explicit prescription to implement rescal\u0002ing transformations. But it was not until the advent of\r
White’s density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\r
algorithm [4] that RG methods became the undisputed\r
numerical approach for systems on a 1D lattice. More re\u0002cently such techniques have gained renewed momentum\r
under the influence of quantum information science. By\r
paying due attention to entanglement, algorithms to sim\u0002ulate time-evolution in 1D systems [5] and to address 2D\r
systems [6] have been put forward.\r
The practical value of DMRG and related methods is\r
unquestionable. And yet, they notably fail to satisfy\r
one of the most natural requirements for a RG transfor\u0002mation, namely to have scale invariant systems as fixed\r
points. Instead, for such systems the number of degrees\r
of freedom (that is, the Hilbert space dimension) of an ef\u0002fective site increases with each rescaling transformation.\r
This fact conflicts with the very spirit of renormalization,\r
but it is not only disturbing from a conceptual viewpoint.\r
The cost of a computation depends on the size of the\r
effective sites and it becomes unaffordable after a suffi\u0002ciently large number of iterations.\r
In this Letter we propose a real-space RG transfor\u0002mation for quantum systems on a D-dimensional lattice\r
that, by renormalizing the amount of entanglement in\r
the system, aims to eliminate the growth of the site’s\r
Hilbert space dimension along successive rescaling trans\u0002formations. In particular, when applied to a scale invari\u0002ant system the transformation is expected to produce a\r
coarse-grained system identical to the original one. Nu\u0002merical tests for critical systems in D = 1 spatial dimen\u0002sions confirm this expectation. Our results also unveil\r
the stratification of entanglement in extended quantum\r
systems, and open the path to a very compact description\r
of quantum criticality.\r
Real-space RG and DMRG.– As originally intro\u0002duced by Wilson [2], real-space RG methods truncate the\r
local Hilbert space of a block of sites in order to reduce\r
its degrees of freedom. Let us consider a system on a\r
lattice L in D spatial dimensions and its Hilbert space\r
VL ≡\r
O\r
s∈L\r
Vs, (1)\r
where s ∈ L denotes the lattice sites and Vs has finite\r
dimension. Let us also consider a block B ⊂ L of neigh\u0002boring sites, with corresponding Hilbert space\r
VB ≡\r
O\r
s∈B\r
Vs. (2)\r
In an elementary RG transformation, the lattice L is\r
mapped into a new, effective lattice L\r
′\r
, where each site\r
s\r
′ ∈ L′\r
is obtained from a block B of sites in L by coarse\u0002graining. More specifically, the space V\r
′\r
s\r
′ for site s\r
′ ∈ L′\r
corresponds to a subspace SB of VB,\r

FIG. 1: Isometries and disentanglers. Left: a standard nu\u0002merical RG transformation builds a coarse-grained site s\r
′\r
,\r
with Hilbert space dimension m, from a block of two sites s1\r
and s2 through the isometry w of Eq. (4). Right: by using the\r
disentanglers u1 and u2 of Eq. (7), short-range entanglement\r
residing near the boundary of the block is eliminated before\r
the coarse-graining step. As a result, the coarse-grained site\r
s˜ requires a smaller Hilbert space dimension ˜m, ˜m < m.\r
|Ψ′i ∈ VL′ . A thoughtful selection of subspace SB is es\u0002sential. On the one hand, its dimension m should be as\r
small as possible, because the cost of subsequent tasks,\r
such as computing expectation values for local observ\u0002ables, grows polynomially with m. On the other, SB\r
needs to be large enough that |Ψ′i retains all relevant\r
properties of |Ψi. White identified the optimal choice\r
as part of his DMRG algorithm [4]. Let ρ\r
[B] denote the\r
reduced density matrix of |Ψi on block B. Then,\r
SB ≡< |ρ1i, · · · , |ρmi >, (5)\r
where |ρii are the m eigenvectors of ρ\r
[B] with largest\r
eigenvalues pi, and m is such that ǫ ≥ 1−\r
Pm\r
i=1 pi\r
, where\r
ǫ is a preestablished truncation error, ǫ ≪ 1.\r
Notice that m refers to the amount of entanglement be\u0002tween B and the rest of the lattice, L−B, as characterized\r
by the rank of the truncated Schmidt decomposition\r
|Ψi ≈ Xm\r
i=1\r
√\r
pi|ρii ⊗ |σii, |σii ∈ VL−B. (6)\r
In other words, the performance of DMRG-based meth\u0002ods depends on the amount of entanglement in |Ψi.\r
Entanglement Renormalization.– We propose a\r
technique to reduce the amount of entanglement between\r
the block B and the rest of the lattice L while still ob\u0002taining a quasi-exact description of the state of the sys\u0002tem. This is achieved by deforming, by means of a uni\u0002tary transformation, the boundaries of the block B before\r
truncating its Hilbert space, see Fig. (1).\r
Let us specialize, for simplicity, to a 1D lattice and to a\r
block B made of just two contiguous sites s1 and s2. Let\r
r1 and r2 be the two sites immediately to the left and to\r
the right of B. Then we consider unitary transformations\r
u1 and u2, the disentanglers, acting on the pairs of sites\r
r1s1 and s2r2,\r
u1 : Vr1 ⊗ Vs1 → Vr1 ⊗ Vs1, u\r
†\r
1u1 = u1u\r
†\r
1 = I,\r
u2 : Vs2 ⊗ Vr2 → Vs2 ⊗ Vr2, u\r
†\r
2u2 = u2u\r
†\r
2 = I. (7)\r
Properly chosen disentanglers reduce the short-range en\u0002tanglement between the block B and its immediate neigh\u0002borhood. The original state ρ\r
[B] of block B,\r
ρ\r
[B] = trr1r2\r

, (9)\r
which has a smaller effective rank ˜m, ˜m < m. Our RG\r
transformation consists of two steps:\r
(i) First we decrease or renormalize the amount of en\u0002tanglement between block B and the rest of L. This is\r
achieved with disentanglers that act locally around the\r
boundary of B. The block does not become completely\r
disentangled because only entanglement localized near its\r
boundaries can be removed.\r
(ii) Then, as in Wilson’s proposal, we truncate the\r
Hilbert space of block B, and we do so following White’s\r
idea to target the support of the block’s density matrix.\r
But instead of keeping the support of the original ρ\r
[B]\r
, we\r
retain the (smaller) support of the partially disentangled\r
density matrix ˜ρ\r

of a MERA for a 2D lattice. Disentanglers and isometries\r
address one of the x and y spatial directions at a time.\r
The above steps, characterized by unitary and iso\u0002metric tensors u and w, produce an alternative coarse\u0002grained lattice L˜ and a coarse-grained state |Ψ˜ i ∈ VL˜\r
that contains less entanglement than |Ψ′i ∈ VL′ . Impor\u0002tantly, the expectation value hΨ|o|Ψi = tr \u0002\r

FIG. 3: Scaling of the entropy of entanglement in 1D quan\u0002tum Ising model with transverse magnetic field. Up: in a\r
critical lattice [h = 1 in Eq. (10)], the unrenormalized entan\u0002glement of the block scales with the block size L according to\r
Eq. (11). Instead, renormalized entanglement remains con\u0002stant along successive RG transformations, as a clear man\u0002ifestation of scale invariance. Line (i) corresponds to using\r
disentanglers only in the first RG transformation. Line (ii)\r
corresponds to using disentanglers only in the first and second\r
RG transformation. Down: in a noncritical lattice [h = 1.001\r
in Eq. (10)], the unrenormalized entanglement scales roughly\r
as in the critical case until it saturates (a) for block sizes com\u0002parable to the correlation length. Beyond that length scale,\r
the renormalized entanglement vanishes (b) and the system\r
becomes effectively unentangled.\r
of sites of L˜ causally connected to R through u and w;\r
(ii) alternatively, we can use u and w to lift o from L to\r
L˜, producing ˜o, and exploit that hΨ|o|Ψi = hΨ˜ |o˜|Ψ˜ i.\r
The lifting of linear operators from L to L˜ generates,\r
by iteration, a well-defined RG flow in the space of hamil\u0002tonians such that, in the 1D case, an interaction term h\r
acting on at most three consecutive sites of L is mapped\r
into an interaction term h˜ acting also on at most three\r
consecutive sites in L˜ [analogous rules apply in D > 1\r
spatial dimensions]. Thus, in spite of the fact that disen\u0002tanglers deform the original tensor product structure of\r
VL, the above rescaling transformation preserves locality,\r
in that it maps local theories into local theories.\r
In the same way as DMRG is related to matrix product\r
states (MPS) [7], the above RG transformation is natu\u0002rally associated to a new ansatz for quantum many-body\r
states on a D dimensional lattice. The multi-scale en\u0002tanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) consists of a\r
network of isometric tensors (namely the isometries u and\r
disentanglers w corresponding to successive iterations of\r
the RG transformation) locally connected in D + 1 di\u0002mensions. The extra direction τ, related to the RG flow,\r
grows only as the logarithm of the lattice dimensions, see\r
Fig. (2). Several properties of the MERA together with\r
its connection to quantum circuits are described in [9].\r

Eq. (5), also increases. In particular, m grows roughly ex\u0002ponentially in the number τ = log2 L of RG transformations.\r

On the other hand, off criticality S(B) grows monoton\u0002ically with L until it reaches a saturation value for a\r
block size comparable to the correlation length in the\r
system. Fig. (3) shows the effect of disentanglers on\r
the entanglement entropy of a block. Most notably, the\r
renormalized entanglement of a block in the critical case\r
is reduced to a small constant value along the RG flow.

Correspondingly, as Fig. (4) shows, the Hilbert space di\u0002mension ˜m of a block of size L = 2τ\r
can be kept constant\r
as we increase τ, allowing in principle for an arbitrary\r
number of iterations of the scale transformation. Our\r
calculations, involving the reduced density matrix of up\r
to L = 214 = 16, 384 spins, have been conducted with\r
Hilbert spaces of dimension ˜m = 8, while keeping the\r
truncation error ǫ at each step fixed below 5 × 10−7. We\r
estimate that without disentanglers an equivalent error ǫ\r
requires a Hilbert space of m ≈ 500 − 1000 dimensions\r
for the largest spin blocks. This exemplifies the compu\u0002tational advantatges of using disentanglers.\r
Discussion.– An appealing picture emerges from\r
the above numerical exploration. Entanglement in the\r
ground state of the quantum spin chain is organized in\r
layers corresponding to different length scales in the sys\u0002tem. The entanglement of a given length scale can be\r
modified by means of a disentangler that acts on a re\u0002gion with linear size as large as that length scale. We\r
obserbe two situations: (i) Off criticality, the entangle\u0002ment between a block of sites B and the rest of the lattice\r
L consists roughly of contributions from layers of length\r
scale not greater than the correlation length in the sys\u0002tem. Therefore, after a sufficiently large number of RG\r
transformations with disentanglers, the effective ground\r
state becomes a product state, that is, completely dis\u0002entangled. (ii) At criticality, instead, the entanglement\r
between R and the rest of L receives equivalent contri\u0002butions from all length scales (smaller than the size of\r
B) – see [9] for a justification of the logarithmic scaling\r
of Eq. (11). In this case, by applying disentanglers we\r
obtain a coarse-grained lattice identical to the original\r
one, including an effective Hamiltonian identical (up to\r
a proportionality constant) to the original one [12]. In\r
either case, a fixed point of the RG transformation is\r
attained after sufficiently many iterations. Non-critical\r
theories collapse into the trivial fixed point (a product\r
state) while critical theories correspond to a non-trivial\r
fixed point (an entangled state expected to depends on\r
the universality class of critical theory). We conjecture\r
that this picture holds also for quantum lattices in D > 1\r
spatial dimensions. Interestingly, a third type of fixed\r
point is possible, in the case of a ground state with ei\u0002ther long-range order or topological order [13].\r
In summary, we have presented a quasi-exact real\u0002space RG transformation that, when tested in 1D sys\u0002tems, produces effective sites of bounded dimension and\r
have (scale invariant) critical systems as its non-trivial\r
fixed points. The key feature of our approach is a lo\u0002cal deformation of the tensor product structure of the\r
Hilbert space of the lattice, that identifies and factorizes\r
out those local degrees of freedom that are uncorrelated\r
from the rest. This deformation is such that local opera\u0002tors are mapped into local operators, so that relevant ex\u0002pectation values for the original system can be efficiently\r
computed from the coarse-grained system.\r
We conclude with two remarks. First, a scale invari\u0002ant critical ground state leads to disentanglers u and\r
isometries w that are the same at each iteration of the\r
RG transformation. A single pair (u, w), depending on\r
O( ˜m4) parameters, is thus seen to specify the ground\r
state, leading to an extremely compact characterization\r
that deserves further study. Second, renormalization\r
group techniques are extensively used also in classical\r
problems, where the MERA can efficiently represent par\u0002tition functions of lattice systems, extending the scope of\r
this work beyond the study quantum systems.\r

In the context of real-space renormalization group methods, we propose a novel scheme for quan\u0002tum systems defined on a D-dimensional lattice. It is based on a coarse-graining transformation\r
that attempts to reduce the amount of entanglement of a block of lattice sites before truncating its\r
Hilbert space. Numerical simulations involving the ground state of a 1D system at criticality show\r
that the resulting coarse-grained site requires a Hilbert space dimension that does not grow with\r
successive rescaling transformations. As a result we can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thou\u0002sands of quantum spins with a computational effort that scales logarithmically in the system’s size.\r
The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized\r
in layers corresponding to different length scales. At a quantum critical point, each rellevant length\r
scale makes an equivalent contribution to the entanglement of a block with the rest of the system.\r
PACS numbers:\r
Renormalization, one of the conceptual pillars of sta\u0002tistical mechanics and quantum field theory, revolves\r
around the idea of rescaling transformations of an ex\u0002tended system [1]. These so-called renormalization group\r
(RG) transformations are not only a key theoretical el\u0002ement in the modern formulation of critical phenomena\r
and phase transitions, but also the basis of important\r
computational methods for many-body problems.\r
In the case of quantum systems defined on a lattice,\r
Wilson’s real-space RG methods [2], based on the trun\u0002cation of the Hilbert space, replaced Kadanoff’s spin\u0002blocking ideas [3] with a concise mathematical formu\u0002lation and an explicit prescription to implement rescal\u0002ing transformations. But it was not until the advent of\r
White’s density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\r
algorithm [4] that RG methods became the undisputed\r
numerical approach for systems on a 1D lattice. More re\u0002cently such techniques have gained renewed momentum\r
under the influence of quantum information science. By\r
paying due attention to entanglement, algorithms to sim\u0002ulate time-evolution in 1D systems [5] and to address 2D\r
systems [6] have been put forward.\r
The practical value of DMRG and related methods is\r
unquestionable. And yet, they notably fail to satisfy\r
one of the most natural requirements for a RG transfor\u0002mation, namely to have scale invariant systems as fixed\r
points. Instead, for such systems the number of degrees\r
of freedom (that is, the Hilbert space dimension) of an ef\u0002fective site increases with each rescaling transformation.\r
This fact conflicts with the very spirit of renormalization,\r
but it is not only disturbing from a conceptual viewpoint.\r
The cost of a computation depends on the size of the\r
effective sites and it becomes unaffordable after a suffi\u0002ciently large number of iterations.\r
In this Letter we propose a real-space RG transfor\u0002mation for quantum systems on a D-dimensional lattice\r
that, by renormalizing the amount of entanglement in\r
the system, aims to eliminate the growth of the site’s\r
Hilbert space dimension along successive rescaling trans\u0002formations. In particular, when applied to a scale invari\u0002ant system the transformation is expected to produce a\r
coarse-grained system identical to the original one. Nu\u0002merical tests for critical systems in D = 1 spatial dimen\u0002sions confirm this expectation. Our results also unveil\r
the stratification of entanglement in extended quantum\r
systems, and open the path to a very compact description\r
of quantum criticality.\r
Real-space RG and DMRG.– As originally intro\u0002duced by Wilson [2], real-space RG methods truncate the\r
local Hilbert space of a block of sites in order to reduce\r
its degrees of freedom. Let us consider a system on a\r
lattice L in D spatial dimensions and its Hilbert space\r
VL ≡\r
O\r
s∈L\r
Vs, (1)\r
where s ∈ L denotes the lattice sites and Vs has finite\r
dimension. Let us also consider a block B ⊂ L of neigh\u0002boring sites, with corresponding Hilbert space\r
VB ≡\r
O\r
s∈B\r
Vs. (2)\r
In an elementary RG transformation, the lattice L is\r
mapped into a new, effective lattice L\r
′\r
, where each site\r
s\r
′ ∈ L′\r
is obtained from a block B of sites in L by coarse\u0002graining. More specifically, the space V\r
′\r
s\r
′ for site s\r
′ ∈ L′\r
corresponds to a subspace SB of VB,\r

FIG. 1: Isometries and disentanglers. Left: a standard nu\u0002merical RG transformation builds a coarse-grained site s\r
′\r
,\r
with Hilbert space dimension m, from a block of two sites s1\r
and s2 through the isometry w of Eq. (4). Right: by using the\r
disentanglers u1 and u2 of Eq. (7), short-range entanglement\r
residing near the boundary of the block is eliminated before\r
the coarse-graining step. As a result, the coarse-grained site\r
s˜ requires a smaller Hilbert space dimension ˜m, ˜m < m.\r
|Ψ′i ∈ VL′ . A thoughtful selection of subspace SB is es\u0002sential. On the one hand, its dimension m should be as\r
small as possible, because the cost of subsequent tasks,\r
such as computing expectation values for local observ\u0002ables, grows polynomially with m. On the other, SB\r
needs to be large enough that |Ψ′i retains all relevant\r
properties of |Ψi. White identified the optimal choice\r
as part of his DMRG algorithm [4]. Let ρ\r
[B] denote the\r
reduced density matrix of |Ψi on block B. Then,\r
SB ≡< |ρ1i, · · · , |ρmi >, (5)\r
where |ρii are the m eigenvectors of ρ\r
[B] with largest\r
eigenvalues pi, and m is such that ǫ ≥ 1−\r
Pm\r
i=1 pi\r
, where\r
ǫ is a preestablished truncation error, ǫ ≪ 1.\r
Notice that m refers to the amount of entanglement be\u0002tween B and the rest of the lattice, L−B, as characterized\r
by the rank of the truncated Schmidt decomposition\r
|Ψi ≈ Xm\r
i=1\r
√\r
pi|ρii ⊗ |σii, |σii ∈ VL−B. (6)\r
In other words, the performance of DMRG-based meth\u0002ods depends on the amount of entanglement in |Ψi.\r
Entanglement Renormalization.– We propose a\r
technique to reduce the amount of entanglement between\r
the block B and the rest of the lattice L while still ob\u0002taining a quasi-exact description of the state of the sys\u0002tem. This is achieved by deforming, by means of a uni\u0002tary transformation, the boundaries of the block B before\r
truncating its Hilbert space, see Fig. (1).\r
Let us specialize, for simplicity, to a 1D lattice and to a\r
block B made of just two contiguous sites s1 and s2. Let\r
r1 and r2 be the two sites immediately to the left and to\r
the right of B. Then we consider unitary transformations\r
u1 and u2, the disentanglers, acting on the pairs of sites\r
r1s1 and s2r2,\r
u1 : Vr1 ⊗ Vs1 → Vr1 ⊗ Vs1, u\r
†\r
1u1 = u1u\r
†\r
1 = I,\r
u2 : Vs2 ⊗ Vr2 → Vs2 ⊗ Vr2, u\r
†\r
2u2 = u2u\r
†\r
2 = I. (7)\r
Properly chosen disentanglers reduce the short-range en\u0002tanglement between the block B and its immediate neigh\u0002borhood. The original state ρ\r

ρ\r
[B] = trr1r2\r

which has a smaller effective rank ˜m, ˜m < m. Our RG\r
transformation consists of two steps:\r
(i) First we decrease or renormalize the amount of en\u0002tanglement between block B and the rest of L. This is\r
achieved with disentanglers that act locally around the\r
boundary of B. The block does not become completely\r
disentangled because only entanglement localized near its\r
boundaries can be removed.\r
(ii) Then, as in Wilson’s proposal, we truncate the\r
Hilbert space of block B, and we do so following White’s\r
idea to target the support of the block’s density matrix.\r
But instead of keeping the support of the original ρ\r
[B]\r

retain the (smaller) support of the partially disentangled\r
density matrix ˜ρ\r

The above steps, characterized by unitary and iso\u0002metric tensors u and w, produce an alternative coarse\u0002grained lattice L˜ and a coarse-grained state |Ψ˜ i ∈ VL˜\r
that contains less entanglement than |Ψ′i ∈ VL′ . Impor\u0002tantly, the expectation value hΨ|o|Ψi = tr \u0002\r

FIG. 3: Scaling of the entropy of entanglement in 1D quan\u0002tum Ising model with transverse magnetic field. Up: in a\r
critical lattice [h = 1 in Eq. (10)], the unrenormalized entan\u0002glement of the block scales with the block size L according to\r
Eq. (11). Instead, renormalized entanglement remains con\u0002stant along successive RG transformations, as a clear man\u0002ifestation of scale invariance. Line (i) corresponds to using\r
disentanglers only in the first RG transformation. Line (ii)\r
corresponds to using disentanglers only in the first and second\r
RG transformation. Down: in a noncritical lattice [h = 1.001\r
in Eq. (10)], the unrenormalized entanglement scales roughly\r
as in the critical case until it saturates (a) for block sizes com\u0002parable to the correlation length. Beyond that length scale,\r
the renormalized entanglement vanishes (b) and the system\r
becomes effectively unentangled.\r
of sites of L˜ causally connected to R through u and w;\r
(ii) alternatively, we can use u and w to lift o from L to\r
L˜, producing ˜o, and exploit that hΨ|o|Ψi = hΨ˜ |o˜|Ψ˜ i.\r
The lifting of linear operators from L to L˜ generates,\r
by iteration, a well-defined RG flow in the space of hamil\u0002tonians such that, in the 1D case, an interaction term h\r
acting on at most three consecutive sites of L is mapped\r
into an interaction term h˜ acting also on at most three\r
consecutive sites in L˜ [analogous rules apply in D > 1\r
spatial dimensions]. Thus, in spite of the fact that disen\u0002tanglers deform the original tensor product structure of\r
VL, the above rescaling transformation preserves locality,\r
in that it maps local theories into local theories.\r
In the same way as DMRG is related to matrix product\r
states (MPS) [7], the above RG transformation is natu\u0002rally associated to a new ansatz for quantum many-body\r
states on a D dimensional lattice. The multi-scale en\u0002tanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) consists of a\r
network of isometric tensors (namely the isometries u and\r
disentanglers w corresponding to successive iterations of\r
the RG transformation) locally connected in D + 1 di\u0002mensions. The extra direction τ, related to the RG flow,\r
grows only as the logarithm of the lattice dimensions, see\r
Fig. (2). Several properties of the MERA together with\r
its connection to quantum circuits are described in [9].\r

FIG. 4: Spectrum of the reduced density matrix of a spin\r

of eigenvalues {pi} required to achieve a given accuracy ǫ, see\r
Eq. (5), also increases. In particular, m grows roughly ex\u0002ponentially in the number τ = log2 L of RG transformations.\r

a significantly smaller ˜m invariant along successive RG trans\u0002formations. Down: spectrum of the reduced density matrix of\r

On the other hand, off criticality S(B) grows monoton\u0002ically with L until it reaches a saturation value for a\r
block size comparable to the correlation length in the\r
system. Fig. (3) shows the effect of disentanglers on\r
the entanglement entropy of a block. Most notably, the\r
renormalized entanglement of a block in the critical case\r
is reduced to a small constant value along the RG flow.

Correspondingly, as Fig. (4) shows, the Hilbert space di\u0002mension ˜m of a block of size L = 2τ\r
can be kept constant\r
as we increase τ, allowing in principle for an arbitrary\r
number of iterations of the scale transformation. Our\r
calculations, involving the reduced density matrix of up\r
to L = 214 = 16, 384 spins, have been conducted with\r
Hilbert spaces of dimension ˜m = 8, while keeping the\r
truncation error ǫ at each step fixed below 5 × 10−7. We\r
estimate that without disentanglers an equivalent error ǫ\r
requires a Hilbert space of m ≈ 500 − 1000 dimensions\r
for the largest spin blocks. This exemplifies the compu\u0002tational advantatges of using disentanglers.\r
Discussion.– An appealing picture emerges from\r
the above numerical exploration. Entanglement in the\r
ground state of the quantum spin chain is organized in\r
layers corresponding to different length scales in the sys\u0002tem. The entanglement of a given length scale can be\r
modified by means of a disentangler that acts on a re\u0002gion with linear size as large as that length scale. We\r
obserbe two situations: (i) Off criticality, the entangle\u0002ment between a block of sites B and the rest of the lattice\r
L consists roughly of contributions from layers of length\r
scale not greater than the correlation length in the sys\u0002tem. Therefore, after a sufficiently large number of RG\r
transformations with disentanglers, the effective ground\r
state becomes a product state, that is, completely dis\u0002entangled. (ii) At criticality, instead, the entanglement\r
between R and the rest of L receives equivalent contri\u0002butions from all length scales (smaller than the size of\r
B) – see [9] for a justification of the logarithmic scaling\r
of Eq. (11). In this case, by applying disentanglers we\r
obtain a coarse-grained lattice identical to the original\r
one, including an effective Hamiltonian identical (up to\r
a proportionality constant) to the original one [12]. In\r
either case, a fixed point of the RG transformation is\r
attained after sufficiently many iterations. Non-critical\r
theories collapse into the trivial fixed point (a product\r
state) while critical theories correspond to a non-trivial\r
fixed point (an entangled state expected to depends on\r
the universality class of critical theory). We conjecture\r
that this picture holds also for quantum lattices in D > 1\r
spatial dimensions. Interestingly, a third type of fixed\r
point is possible, in the case of a ground state with ei\u0002ther long-range order or topological order [13].\r
In summary, we have presented a quasi-exact real\u0002space RG transformation that, when tested in 1D sys\u0002tems, produces effective sites of bounded dimension and\r
have (scale invariant) critical systems as its non-trivial\r
fixed points. The key feature of our approach is a lo\u0002cal deformation of the tensor product structure of the\r
Hilbert space of the lattice, that identifies and factorizes\r
out those local degrees of freedom that are uncorrelated\r
from the rest. This deformation is such that local opera\u0002tors are mapped into local operators, so that relevant ex\u0002pectation values for the original system can be efficiently\r
computed from the coarse-grained system.\r
We conclude with two remarks. First, a scale invari\u0002ant critical ground state leads to disentanglers u and\r
isometries w that are the same at each iteration of the\r
RG transformation. A single pair (u, w), depending on\r
O( ˜m4) parameters, is thus seen to specify the ground\r
state, leading to an extremely compact characterization\r
that deserves further study. Second, renormalization\r
group techniques are extensively used also in classical\r
problems, where the MERA can efficiently represent par\u0002tition functions of lattice systems, extending the scope of\r
this work beyond the study quantum systems.\r
