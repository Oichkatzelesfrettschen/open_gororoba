Abstract\r
New orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for the Vladimirov oper\u0002ator of p–adic fractional derivation is constructed. The map of p–adic\r
numbers onto real numbers (p–adic change of variable) is considered.\r
p–Adic change of variable maps the Haar measure on p–adic numbers\r
onto the Lebesgue measure on the positive semiline. p–Adic change of\r
variable (for p = 2) provides an equivalence between the constructed\r
basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator and the wavelet\r
basis in L\r
2\r
(R+) generated from the Haar wavelet. This means that\r
the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic spectral analysis.\r
1 Introduction\r
In the present paper we construct a new orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions\r
of the Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation. The example\r
of such a basis one can find in [1]. Different basises of eigenvectors of the\r
Vladimirov operator were built in [2], [3], [4]. The basis constructed in the\r
present paper consists of locally constant functions with support on p–adic\r
discs.\r
We also check that the constructed basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov\r
operator (for p = 2) is equivalent to the wavelet basis in L\r
2\r
(R+) generated\r
from the Haar wavelet. This equivalence is given by p–adic change of vari\u0002ables: the map of p–adic numbers onto real numbers that conserves the\r
measure. This means that the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic\r

harmonic analysis (decomposition of functions over the eigenfunctions of the\r
Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation).\r
For introduction to p-adic analysis see [1]. p-Adic analysis and p-adic\r
mathematical physics attract great interest, see [1], [5], [6]. For instance, p\u0002adic models in string theory were introduced, see [7], [8], and p-adic quantum\r
mechanics [9] and p–adic quantum gravity [10] were investigated. p–Adic\r
analysis was applied to investigate the spontaneous breaking of the replica\r
symmetry, cf. [11], [12], [13], [14].\r
Let us make here a brief review of p-adic analysis. The field Qp of p-adic\r
numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers Q with respect\r
to the p-adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way. An\r
arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = p\r
γ m\r
n with m and\r
n not divisible by p. The p-adic norm of the rational number x = p\r
γ m\r
n\r
is\r
equal to |x|p = p\r
−γ\r
.\r
The most interesting property of the field of p-adic numbers is ultra\u0002metricity. This means that Qp obeys the strong triangle inequality\r
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p, |y|p).\r
We will consider disks in Qp of the form {x ∈ Qp : |x − x0|p ≤ p\r
−k}. For\r
example, the ring Zp of integer p-adic numbers is the disk {x ∈ Qp : |x|p ≤ 1}\r
which is the completion of integers with the p-adic norm. The main properties\r
of disks in arbitrary ultrametric space are the following:\r
1. Every point of a disk is the center of this disk.\r
2. Two disks either do not intersect or one of these disks contains the\r
other.\r
The p-adic Fourier transform F of the function f(x) is defined as follows\r
F[f](ξ) = ef(ξ) = Z\r
Qp\r
χ(ξx)f(x)dµ(x)\r
Here dµ(x) is the Haar measure. The inverse Fourier transform have the\r
form\r
F\r
−1\r
[ge](x) = Z\r
Qp\r
χ(−ξx)ge(ξ)dµ(ξ)\r
Here χ(ξx) = exp(2πiξx) is the character of the field of p-adic numbers. For\r
example, the Fourier transform of the indicator function Ω(x) of the disk of\r
2

radius 1 with center in zero (this is a function that equals to 1 on the disk\r
and to 0 outside the disk) is the function of the same type:\r
Ω( e ξ) = Ω(ξ)\r
In the present paper we use the following Vladimirov operator Dα\r
x\r
of the\r
fractional p-adic differentiation, that is defined [1] as\r

Here F is the (p-adic) Fourier transform, the second equality holds for α > 0.\r

2 p–Adic spectral analysis\r
Let us construct an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the Vladimirov op\u0002erator. The following lemma gives the basic technical result.\r
Lemma 1. The function\r
ψ(x) = χ(p\r
−1x)Ω (|x|p) (2)\r
is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator:\r
D\r
αψ(x) = pαψ(x)\r
Remark. The eigenvalue for ψ(x) is the same as for the character χ(p\r
−1x):\r
D\r
αχ(p−1x) = pαχ(p−1x)\r
Proof Let us check that ψ(x) is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator.\r
We get\r
D\r
αψ(x) = p\r

dµ(y) (3)\r
Let us calculate the integral over y in (3) in two cases.\r
1) Let |x|p ≤ 1. In this case the integral in (3) is given by\r
Z\r
1 − χ(p\r
−1\r
(y − x))Ω (|y|p)\r
|x − y|\r
1+α\r
p\r
dµ(y)\r
Using that every point of p–adic disk is its center we get that for |x|p ≤ 1 we\r
have Ω (|y|p) = Ω (|x − y|p) and therefore the integral is equal to\r
Z\r
1 − χ(p\r
−1\r

2) Let |x|p > 1. For the integral in (3) we get\r

1+α\r
p\r
Z\r
|y|p≤1\r
χ(p\r

(y − x))dµ(y) = 0\r
This proves that ψ(x) is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator with\r
the following eigenvalue\r

One can check that the set of (integrable) functions ψ(ax + b) (for different\r

|p) = Ω(|p\r

Since n\r

′−γn − n\r
′\r
|p) is non–zero (and equal to\r
one) for\r
n\r

Therefore the scalar product (7) can be non–zero only for γ = γ\r

the integral (8) is equal to\r

we get for (7)\r

(j\r

that proves that the vectors ψγjn are orthonormal.\r
To prove that the set of vectors {ψγjn} is an orthonormal basis (is total\r
in L\r
2\r
(Qp)) we use the Parsevale identity.\r
Since the set of indicators (characteristic functions) of p–adic discs is\r
total in L\r
2\r
(Qp) and the set of vectors {ψγjn} is translationally invariant and\r
invariant under dilations x 7→ p\r
nx, x ∈ Qp, to prove that {ψγjn} is a complete\r
system it is enough to check the Parsevale identity for the indicator Ω(|x|p).\r
We have\r
hΩ(|x|p), ψγjni = p\r
−\r
γ\r
2 θ(γ)δn0, θ(γ) = 0, γ ≤ 0, θ(γ) = 1, γ ≥ 1 (9)\r
Formula (9) implies the Parsevale identity for Ω(|x|p):\r

|hΩ(|x|p), ψγjni|2 =\r
X∞\r
γ=1\r
(p − 1)p\r
−γ = 1 = |hΩ(|x|p), Ω(|x|p)i|2\r
that proves that {ψγjn} is an orthonormal basis in L\r
2\r
(Qp).\r
Formula (4) implies that the basis {ψγjn} is an orhtonormal basis of\r
eigenvectors of the operator Dα with eigenvalues (6). This finishes the proof\r
of the theorem.\r

3 Wavelet interpretation\r
Let us discuss the connection between the constructed basis {ψγjn} and the\r
basis of wavelets in the space of quadratically integrable functions L\r
2\r
(R+)\r
on positive semiline. The wavelet basis in L\r
2\r
(R+) is a basis given by shifts\r
and dilations of the so called mother wavelet function, cf. [15]. The simplest\r
example of such a function is the Haar wavelet\r
Ψ(x) = χ[0,\r
1\r
2\r
]\r
(x) − χ[\r
1\r
2\r
,1](x) (10)\r
(difference of two characteristic functions).\r
The wavelet basis in L\r
2\r
(R) (or basis of multiresolution wavelets) is the\r
basis\r
Ψγn(x) = 2−\r
γ\r
2 Ψ(2−γx − n), γ ∈ Z, n ∈ Z (11)\r
Consider the p–adic change of variables, i.e. the onto map\r

aip\r
−i−1\r
, ai = 0, . . . , p − 1, γ ∈ Z (12)\r
This map is not a one–to–one map. The map ρ is continuous and moreover\r
Lemma 3. The map ρ satisfies the Holder inequality\r
|ρ(x) − ρ(y)| ≤ |x − y|p (13)\r
Proof Consider\r
x =\r

1) Let α < β. Then\r
|ρ(x) − ρ(y)| ≤ (p − 1)X∞\r
i=α\r
p\r
−i−1 = |x − y|p\r
2) Let α = β. Then |x − y|p = p\r
−γ\r
, γ > α.\r
ρ(x) − ρ(y) = X∞\r

−i−1\r
|ρ(x) − ρ(y)| ≤ (p − 1)X∞\r
i=γ\r
p\r
−i−1 = p−γ = |x − y|p\r
that finishes the proof of the lemma.\r
The following map is a one–to–one map:\r
ρ : Qp/Zp → N\r
where N is a set of natural numbers including zero.\r
Here Qp/Zp is a group (with respect to addition modulo 1) of numbers of\r
the form\r
x =\r
X−1\r
i=γ\r
xip\r
i\r
Lemma 4. For n ∈ Qp/Zp and m, k ∈ Z the map ρ satisfies the condi\u0002tions\r
ρ : p\r
mn + pkZp → p−mρ(n) + [0, p−k\r
] (14)\r
ρ : Qp\\{p\r
mn + pkZp} → R+\\{p−mρ(n) + [0, p−k\r
]} (15)\r
up to a finite number of points.\r
Proof We consider for simplicity the case ρ0 = ρ and k = 0. Consider\r
n ∈ Qp/Zp:\r
n =\r

n − 1 = X−1\r

−i−1 = ρ(n)+1\r
Application of (13) for y = n, y = n − 1 proves that n + Zp maps into\r
ρ(n) + [0, 1]. Since the map Qp/Zp → N is one–to–one this proves the\r
lemma.\r
Lemma 5. The map ρ maps the Haar measure µ on Qp onto the Lebesgue\r
measure l on R+: for measurable subspace X ⊂ Qp\r
µ(X) = l(ρ(X))\r
or in symbolic notations\r
ρ : dµ(x) 7→ dx\r
Proof Lemma 4 implies that balls in Qp map onto closed intervals in\r
R+ with conservation of measure. The map ρ : Qp → R+ is surjective and\r
moreover nonintersecting balls map onto intervals thaat do not intersect or\r
have intersection of the measure zero (by lemma 4). This proves the lemma.\r
Therefore the corresponding map\r

: L\r
2\r
(R+) → L\r
2\r
(Qp)\r
ρ\r
∗\r
f(x) = f(ρ(x)) (16)\r
is an unitary operator.\r
Lemma 4 implies the following:\r
Lemma 6. The map ρ maps the Haar wavelet (10) onto the function (2)\r
(for p = 2):\r
ρ\r
∗\r
: Ψ(x) 7→ ψ(x) (17)\r
(17) is an equality in L\r
2\r
: on the set of zero measure (17) may not be true.\r
Moreover, we have the following theorem:\r

Theorem 7. For p = 2 the map ρ maps the orthonormal basis of wavelets\r
in L\r
2\r
(R+) (11) (generated from the Haar wavelet) onto the basis (5) of\r
eigenvectors of the Vladimirov operator:\r
ρ\r
∗\r
: Ψγρ(n)(x) 7→ (−1)nψγ1n(x) (18)\r
Proof We have\r
2\r
−γ\r
ρ(x) = ρ(2γx) (19)\r
Lemma 4 implies for ρ(n) ∈ N\r
χ[0,1](ρ(2γx) − ρ(n)) = χ[0,1](ρ(2γx − n)) (20)\r
(20) is true almost everywhere. Analogously\r
χ[0,\r
1\r
2\r
]\r
(ρ(2γx) − ρ(n)) = χ[0,\r
1\r
2\r
]\r
(ρ(2γx − n)) (21)\r
Formulas (11), (19), (20), (21) imply\r
Ψγρ(n)(ρ(x)) = 2−\r
γ\r
2 Ψ(2−γ\r
ρ(x) − ρ(n)) =\r
= 2−\r
γ\r
2 Ψ(ρ(2γx − n)) = 2−\r
γ\r
2 ψ(2γx − n)\r
The last equality follows from (16).\r
Formula (5) implies that for p = 2\r
ψγ1n(x) = 2−\r
γ\r
2 χ(2γ−1x)Ω(|2\r
γx − n|2) = (−1)n\r
2\r
−\r
γ\r
2 ψ(2γx − n)\r
that proves (18) and finishes the proof of the theorem.\r
We get that after the p–adic change of variables (12) the wavelet anal\u0002ysis becomes the p–adic spectral analysis (expansion of a function over the\r
eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator of p–adic derivation).\r
Using this interpretation we will call the basis (5) the wavelet basis (or\r
p–adic wavelet basis).\r
Using map (16) it is possible to define the action of the Vladimirov oper\u0002ator in L\r
2\r
(R+) by the formula\r

Abstract\r
New orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions for the Vladimirov oper\u0002ator of p–adic fractional derivation is constructed. The map of p–adic\r
numbers onto real numbers (p–adic change of variable) is considered.\r
p–Adic change of variable maps the Haar measure on p–adic numbers\r
onto the Lebesgue measure on the positive semiline. p–Adic change of\r
variable (for p = 2) provides an equivalence between the constructed\r
basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator and the wavelet\r
basis in L\r
2\r
(R+) generated from the Haar wavelet. This means that\r
the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic spectral analysis."""

In the present paper we construct a new orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions\r
of the Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation. The example\r
of such a basis one can find in [1]. Different basises of eigenvectors of the\r
Vladimirov operator were built in [2], [3], [4]. The basis constructed in the\r
present paper consists of locally constant functions with support on p–adic\r
discs.\r
We also check that the constructed basis of eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov\r
operator (for p = 2) is equivalent to the wavelet basis in L\r
2\r
(R+) generated\r
from the Haar wavelet. This equivalence is given by p–adic change of vari\u0002ables: the map of p–adic numbers onto real numbers that conserves the\r
measure. This means that the wavelet analysis can be considered as a p–adic\r

harmonic analysis (decomposition of functions over the eigenfunctions of the\r
Vladimirov operator of p–adic fractional derivation).\r
For introduction to p-adic analysis see [1]. p-Adic analysis and p-adic\r
mathematical physics attract great interest, see [1], [5], [6]. For instance, p\u0002adic models in string theory were introduced, see [7], [8], and p-adic quantum\r
mechanics [9] and p–adic quantum gravity [10] were investigated. p–Adic\r
analysis was applied to investigate the spontaneous breaking of the replica\r
symmetry, cf. [11], [12], [13], [14].\r
Let us make here a brief review of p-adic analysis. The field Qp of p-adic\r
numbers is the completion of the field of rational numbers Q with respect\r
to the p-adic norm on Q. This norm is defined in the following way. An\r
arbitrary rational number x can be written in the form x = p\r
γ m\r
n with m and\r
n not divisible by p. The p-adic norm of the rational number x = p\r
γ m\r
n\r
is\r
equal to |x|p = p\r
−γ\r
.\r
The most interesting property of the field of p-adic numbers is ultra\u0002metricity. This means that Qp obeys the strong triangle inequality\r
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p, |y|p).\r
We will consider disks in Qp of the form {x ∈ Qp : |x − x0|p ≤ p\r
−k}. For\r
example, the ring Zp of integer p-adic numbers is the disk {x ∈ Qp : |x|p ≤ 1}\r
which is the completion of integers with the p-adic norm. The main properties\r
of disks in arbitrary ultrametric space are the following:"""

The p-adic Fourier transform F of the function f(x) is defined as follows\r
F[f](ξ) = ef(ξ) = Z\r

radius 1 with center in zero (this is a function that equals to 1 on the disk\r
and to 0 outside the disk) is the function of the same type:\r
Ω( e ξ) = Ω(ξ)\r

2 p–Adic spectral analysis\r
Let us construct an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of the Vladimirov op\u0002erator. The following lemma gives the basic technical result.\r
Lemma 1. The function\r
ψ(x) = χ(p\r
−1x)Ω (|x|p) (2)\r
is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator:\r
D\r
αψ(x) = pαψ(x)\r
Remark. The eigenvalue for ψ(x) is the same as for the character χ(p\r
−1x):\r
D\r
αχ(p−1x) = pαχ(p−1x)\r
Proof Let us check that ψ(x) is an eigenvector of the Vladimirov operator.\r
We get\r

dµ(y) (3)\r
Let us calculate the integral over y in (3) in two cases.\r
1) Let |x|p ≤ 1. In this case the integral in (3) is given by\r
Z\r
1 − χ(p\r
−1\r
(y − x))Ω (|y|p)\r
|x − y|\r
1+α\r
p\r
dµ(y)\r
Using that every point of p–adic disk is its center we get that for |x|p ≤ 1 we\r
have Ω (|y|p) = Ω (|x − y|p) and therefore the integral is equal to\r
Z\r
1 − χ(p\r
