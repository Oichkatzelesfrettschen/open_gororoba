Abstract. When searching for a new resonance somewhere in a possible mass range,\r
the significance of observing a local excess of events must take into account the prob\u0002ability of observing such an excess anywhere in the range. This is the so called “look\r
elsewhere effect”. The effect can be quantified in terms of a trial factor, which is the\r
ratio between the probability of observing the excess at some fixed mass point, to\r
the probability of observing it anywhere in the range. We propose a simple and fast\r
procedure for estimating the trial factor, based on earlier results by Davies. We show\r
that asymptotically, the trial factor grows linearly with the (fixed mass) significance.\r
1 Introduction\r
The statistical significance that is associated to\r
the observation of new phenomena is usually ex\u0002pressed using a p-value, that is, the probability\r
that a similar or more extreme effect would be\r
seen when the signal does not exist (a situation\r
usually referred to as the null or background\u0002only hypothesis). It is often the case that one\r
does not a priori know where the signal will ap\u0002pear within some possible range. In that case,\r
the significance calculation must take into ac\u0002count the fact that an excess of events anywhere\r
in the range could equally be considered as a sig\u0002nal. This is known as the “look elsewhere effect”\r
[1][2]. In the statistical literature this situation is\r
usually referred to as an hypothesis test when a\r
nuisance parameter is present only under the al\u0002ternative, for which the standard regularity con\u0002ditions do not apply. The problem is however\r
closely related to that of a level crossings of a\r
stochastic process, which has been studied exten\u0002sively and for which many relevant results exist\r

[3],[4]. In particular [4] provides an upper bound\r
on the tail probability of the maximum of a chi\u0002squared process, which can therefore be applied\r
to cases when the test statistic is the profile like\u0002lihood ratio and the large-sample distribution at\r
a fixed point given by Wilks’ theorem [5] holds.\r
Of course, a straightforward way of quanti\u0002fying the look-elsewhere effect may be simply\r
running many Monte-Carlo simulations of back\u0002ground only experiments, and finding for each\r
one the largest fluctuation that resembles a sig\u0002nal1\r
. Examples for such an approach can be found\r
e.g. in [6]. While this procedure is simple and\r
gives the correct answer, it is also time and CPU\r
consuming, as one would have to repeat it O(107)\r
times to get the p-value corresponding to a 5σ\r
significance. Approximations based on large sam\u0002ple limits such as [4] can therefore be valuable.\r
To make the discussion concrete, let us first\r
describe a typical example of a ‘mass bump’ search.\r
1\r
It is assumed that the signal can appear only in\r
one location, therefore when a search is conducted,\r
one will look for the largest excess of events and\r
regard all others as background fluctuations.

2 Eilam Gross, Ofer Vitells: Trial factors for the look elsewhere effect in high energy physics\r
The statistical model in this case consists of a\r
background distribution b, and a signal distri\u0002bution s(m) with an unknown location param\u0002eter m (corresponding to the mass of a reso\u0002nance). We introduce a signal strength parame\u0002ter µ, such that the model is given by µs(m) +b,\r
and we test H0 : µ = 0 against the alternative,\r
µ > 0\r
2\r
. Both s and b may depend on addi\u0002tional nuisance parameters which are omitted\r
from the notation. The mass m is another nui\u0002sance parameter, but it does not exist under H0\r
since b does not depend on m. The testing prob\u0002lem has therefore a nuisance parameter that is\r
present only under the alternative. When search\u0002ing for a resonance that can appear anywhere in\r
the range, one will look for the largest excess of\r
events above the background. More precisely, if\r
q(m) is a test statistic for a fixed mass, and large\r
values of q(m) indicate decreasing compatibility\r
with the null hypothesis, then the test statistic\r
of the entire range would be q( ˆm) = max\r
m\r
[q(m)].\r
The problem is therefore in assessing the tail\r
probability (p-value) of the maximum of q(m)\r
over the search range.\r
In section 2 we review the main result of\r
[4] and its application to the present case. We\r
propose a practical procedure for estimating the\r
p-value, which we then demonstrate with a toy\r
model simulation in section 3.\r
2 Tail probabilities of the likelihood\r
ratio test statistic\r
Suppose that a signal hypothesis depends on a\r
nuisance parameter θ that does not exist under\r
the null. We denote by q(θ) the profile likelihood\r
test statistic for some fixed θ and we assume that\r
it follows a χ\r
2 distribution with s degrees of free\u0002dom, as would be the case in the large sample\r
limit when Wilks’ theorem holds. We are inter\u0002ested in the tail probability of the maximum of\r
2\r
Strictly speaking, Wilks’ theorem does not apply\r
here since the tested value of µ is on the boundary\r
of the allowed region. This difficulty however can be\r
easily alleviated by extending the allowed region of µ\r
to negative values and then reducing the p-value by\r
half. A formal generalization of this nature is given\r
in [7].\r
q(θ) over θ, which we denote by q(\r
ˆθ). As shown\r
in [4], this is bounded by:\r
P(q(\r
ˆθ) > c) 6 P(χ\r
2\r
s > c) + hN(c)i (1)\r
where N(c) is the number of ‘upcrossings’ of\r
the level c by the process q(θ), with an expecta\u0002tion that is given by [4]:\r
hN(c)i =\r
c\r
(s−1)/2\r
e\r
−c/2\r
√\r
π2\r
s/2Γ(s/2 + 1/2) Z U\r
L\r
C(θ)dθ (2)\r
Where [L, U] is the range of possible values\r
of θ, and C(θ) is some function that depends on\r
the details of the statistical model. To have the\r
maximum of q(θ) above the level c means that\r
either the value at the lower threshold q(L) is\r
larger than c, or that there is at least one up\u0002crossing, hence the two terms in (1). Note that\r
the bound is expected to become an equality for\r
large values of c, as the expected number of up\u0002crossings will be dominated by the probability of\r
one upcrossing, that is when hN(c)i ≪ 1.\r
The function C(θ) can in general be diffi\u0002cult to calculate. Instead, we propose to estimate\r
hN(c0)i at some low reference level c0 by simply\r
counting the number of upcrossings in a small\r
set of background-only Monte Carlo simulations.\r
Eq. (1) then becomes\r
P(q(\r
ˆθ) > c) 6 P(χ\r
2\r
s > c)+hN(c0)i(\r
c\r
c0\r
)\r
(s−1)/2\r
e\r
−(c−c0)/2\r
(3)\r
and so once hN(c0)i is determined, the p-value\r
of a given observation and the corresponding sig\u0002nificance are readily obtained.\r
Naturally, one would like to choose the ref\u0002erence level c0 in a way that will minimize the\r
resulting uncertainty on the bound. From (3),\r
it can be seen that the statistical uncertainty is\r
proportional to σN /hNi where σN is the stan\u0002dard deviation of N. As long as the the distri\u0002bution of N is ‘well behaved’ in the sense that\r
the relative uncertainty decreases with increas\u0002ing hNi, then the optimal choice of c0 would be\r
that which maximizes the expected number of\r
upcrossings (2), that is c0 = s − 1. Note that in\r
the case s = 1, the maximal number of upcross\u0002ings occurs at c0 → 0, however the ability to

Eilam Gross, Ofer Vitells: Trial factors for the look elsewhere effect in high energy physics 3\r
reliably estimate hN(c0)i at very low levels de\u0002pends on the numerical resolution at which q(θ)\r
is calculated. In this case, one should therefore\r
aim at having c0 as low as possible but still sig\u0002nificantly larger than the numerical resolution of\r
q(θ), and the typical distance between upcross\u0002ings should be kept significantly larger than the\r
θ resolution. In the example considered in the\r
following section c0 = 0.5 satisfies those condi\u0002tions and proves to be a good choice.\r
It is further interesting to note that the de\u0002pendence of hN(c)i on c in (2), is the same as the\r
asymptotic form of the cumulative distribution\r
of a χ\r
2 variable with s + 1 degrees of freedom,\r

And the bound has been replaced by a ‘≈’\r
sign since we are dealing with the large c limit.\r
The probability described by eq. (5) has a nat\u0002ural interpretation. It is the same as one would\r
have for a random variable that is the maximal\r
of n independent χ\r
2\r
s+1 variates and one χ\r
2\r
s vari\u0002ate, with E[n] = N . That is, if\r
y = max[x0, x1...xn] (7)\r
and\r
x0 ∼ χ\r
2\r
s\r
, xi ∼ χ\r
2\r
s+1 i = 1...n, E[n] = N\r
then the tail probability P(y > c) for large c\r
is given by the right hand side of (5).\r
Intuitively, this suggests that we can view the\r
range of θ as being composed of several (on aver\u0002age N ) independent regions , where in each one\r
the likelihood fit involves an extra degree of free\u0002dom due to the variable mass, leading to a χ\r
2\r
s+1\r
distribution. The χ\r
2\r
s\r
term accounts for the pos\u0002sibility of having a local maximum on the edge\r
of the allowed region (assuming, from symme\u0002try reasons, that each edge has a probability 1/2\r
of being a local maximum). The number N can\r
therefore be interpreted as an ‘effective number’\r
of independent search regions.\r
We remark that exactly such an intuitive rea\u0002soning was employed by Quayle [8] as a conjec\u0002ture for the distribution of q(\r
ˆθ). It was found\r
that the distribution of a random variable de\u0002fined according to (7) reproduces, to a good ap\u0002proximation, that of q(\r
ˆθ), and that the agree\u0002ment is better at the tail. As shown above, this\r
behavior is expected and the conjecture is in fact\r
a limiting case of Davies’ formula (1).\r
2.1 Trial factors\r
It is sometimes useful to describe the look-elsewhere\r
effect in terms of a trial factor, which is the ratio\r
between the probability of observing the excess\r
at some fixed mass point, to the probability of\r
observing it anywhere in the range. From (5), we\r
have\r
trial# = P(q(\r
ˆθ) > c)\r
P(q(θ) > c)\r
(8)\r
≈ 1 + N\r
P(χ\r
2\r
s+1 > c)\r
P(χ2\r
s > c)\r
(9)\r
≈ 1 + N\r
r\r
c\r
2\r
Γ(s/2)\r
Γ((s + 1)/2) (10)\r
For the case s = 1, √\r
c is just the ‘fixed’\r
significance, that is the quantile of a standard\r
gaussian corresponding to a p-value of chi-square\r
with s degrees of freedom. This also holds asymp\u0002totically for s > 1, as Zf ix =\r
√\r
c + O(s\r
log(c)\r
√\r
c\r
).\r
We therefore have, for c ≫ s,\r
trial# ≈ 1 +\r

The trial factor is thus asymptotically linear\r
with both the effective number of independent\r
regions, and with the fixed-mass significance.\r
3 Toy model simulations\r
We shall now illustrate the procedure described\r
above with a simple example. Our toy model\r
consists of a gaussian signal (‘mass bump’) on\r
top of a continuous background that follows a\r
Rayleigh distribution, in a mass range [0,120].\r
The width of the gaussian increases linearly with\r
the mass, representing a case where the mass res\u0002olution changes with the mass.\r
We assume that the background shape is known\r
but its normalization is not, so that it is a free\r
parameter in the fit (i.e. a nuisance parameter),\r
together with the signal location and normaliza\u0002tion. We use a binned profile likelihood ratio as\r
our test statistic, where the number of events in\r
each bin is assumed to be Poisson distributed\r
with an expected value\r
E(ni) = µsi(m) + βbi (13)\r
where µ is the signal strength parameter, si(m)\r
corresponds to a gaussian located at a mass m, β\r
is the background normalization and bi are fixed\r
and given by the Rayleigh distribution. For sim\u0002plicity of notation we will use in the following\r
s = {si} and b = {βbi}. The hypothesis that no\r
signal exists, or equivalently that µ = 0, will be\r
referred to as the null hypothesis, H0. ˆµ and bˆ\r
will denote maximum likelihood estimators while\r
ˆ\r
bˆ will denote the conditional maximum likeli\u0002hood estimator of the background normalization\r
under the null hypothesis.\r
The test statistic q(m) is defined as:\r
q(m) = −2ln L(b\r
ˆˆ)\r
L(ˆµs(m) + bˆ)\r
. (14)\r
where L is the likelihood function. An example\r
background-only pseudo-experiment is shown in\r
Fig.1, together with q(m).\r
We choose a reference level of c0 = 0.5 and\r
estimate the expected number of upcrossings, as\r
demonstrated in Fig.1, from a set of 100 Monte\r
Carlo simulations of background experiments. This\r
gives hN(c0)i = 4.34 ± 0.11, which corresponds\r
to N = 5.58 ± 0.14. The distribution of q( ˆm)\r
is then estimated from a sample of ∼1 million\r
background simulations and we compare the tail\r
probabilities to the prediction of (3). The results\r
are shown in Fig.2. The bound of (3) gives an ex\u0002cellent approximation to the observed p-values\r
for large c.\r

band represents the statistical uncertainty due to the\r
limited sample size.\r
We consider in addition a case where the\r
number of degrees of freedom is more than one.\r
For this purpose, we assume several indepen\u0002dent channels, each identical to the one described\r
above, and where the signal normalizations (µ1, ..., µs)\r
are free parameters. (This could represent, for\r
example, a case where one is searching for a res\u0002onance in several decay channels, with unknown\r
branching ratios). The reference level is chosen\r
to be c0 = s−1 as discussed in the previous sec\u0002tion. The resulting distributions and trial factors\r
for s = 2, 3 are shown in figures 4 and 5. As be\u0002fore, the the bound (3) agrees with the observed\r
p-value, within statistical variation. The rate at\r
which the asymptotic approximation (11) con\u0002verges to the bound becomes slower when the\r
number of degrees of freedom increases, mak\u0002ing it less accurate, however the trend of linear\r
growth is evident.\r

to the fixed-mass significance, allowing for a sim\u0002ple interpretation of the effect as being the result\r
of two factors: the first one is the mere fact that\r
there are more available distinct regions wherein\r
fluctuations can occur, represented by the effec\u0002tive number of independent regions; the second\r
effect is that within each region we further max\u0002imize the likelihood by fitting the mass in the\r
neighborhood of the fluctuation, which can be\r
described by adding a degree of freedom to the\r
fit.

the significance calculation must take into ac\u0002count the fact that an excess of events anywhere\r
in the range could equally be considered as a sig\u0002nal. This is known as the “look elsewhere effect”\r
[1][2]. In the statistical literature this situation is\r
usually referred to as an hypothesis test when a\r
nuisance parameter is present only under the al\u0002ternative, for which the standard regularity con\u0002ditions do not apply. The problem is however\r
closely related to that of a level crossings of a\r
stochastic process, which has been studied exten\u0002sively and for which many relevant results exist\r

[3],[4]. In particular [4] provides an upper bound\r
on the tail probability of the maximum of a chi\u0002squared process, which can therefore be applied\r
to cases when the test statistic is the profile like\u0002lihood ratio and the large-sample distribution at\r
a fixed point given by Wilks’ theorem [5] holds.\r
Of course, a straightforward way of quanti\u0002fying the look-elsewhere effect may be simply\r
running many Monte-Carlo simulations of back\u0002ground only experiments, and finding for each\r
one the largest fluctuation that resembles a sig\u0002nal1\r
. Examples for such an approach can be found\r
e.g. in [6]. While this procedure is simple and\r
gives the correct answer, it is also time and CPU\r
consuming, as one would have to repeat it O(107)\r
times to get the p-value corresponding to a 5σ\r
significance. Approximations based on large sam\u0002ple limits such as [4] can therefore be valuable.\r

describe a typical example of a ‘mass bump’ search."""

in [7].\r
q(θ) over θ, which we denote by q(\r
ˆθ). As shown\r
in [4], this is bounded by:\r
P(q(\r
ˆθ) > c) 6 P(χ\r
2\r
s > c) + hN(c)i (1)\r
where N(c) is the number of ‘upcrossings’ of\r
the level c by the process q(θ), with an expecta\u0002tion that is given by [4]:\r

Where [L, U] is the range of possible values\r
of θ, and C(θ) is some function that depends on\r
the details of the statistical model. To have the\r
maximum of q(θ) above the level c means that\r
either the value at the lower threshold q(L) is\r
larger than c, or that there is at least one up\u0002crossing, hence the two terms in (1). Note that\r
the bound is expected to become an equality for\r
large values of c, as the expected number of up\u0002crossings will be dominated by the probability of\r
one upcrossing, that is when hN(c)i ≪ 1.\r
The function C(θ) can in general be diffi\u0002cult to calculate. Instead, we propose to estimate\r
hN(c0)i at some low reference level c0 by simply\r
counting the number of upcrossings in a small\r
set of background-only Monte Carlo simulations.\r
Eq. (1) then becomes\r
P(q(\r

(3)\r
and so once hN(c0)i is determined, the p-value\r
of a given observation and the corresponding sig\u0002nificance are readily obtained.\r
Naturally, one would like to choose the ref\u0002erence level c0 in a way that will minimize the\r
resulting uncertainty on the bound. From (3),\r
it can be seen that the statistical uncertainty is\r
proportional to σN /hNi where σN is the stan\u0002dard deviation of N. As long as the the distri\u0002bution of N is ‘well behaved’ in the sense that\r
the relative uncertainty decreases with increas\u0002ing hNi, then the optimal choice of c0 would be\r
that which maximizes the expected number of\r
upcrossings (2), that is c0 = s − 1. Note that in\r
the case s = 1, the maximal number of upcross\u0002ings occurs at c0 → 0, however the ability to

Eilam Gross, Ofer Vitells: Trial factors for the look elsewhere effect in high energy physics 3\r
reliably estimate hN(c0)i at very low levels de\u0002pends on the numerical resolution at which q(θ)\r
is calculated. In this case, one should therefore\r
aim at having c0 as low as possible but still sig\u0002nificantly larger than the numerical resolution of\r
q(θ), and the typical distance between upcross\u0002ings should be kept significantly larger than the\r
θ resolution. In the example considered in the\r
following section c0 = 0.5 satisfies those condi\u0002tions and proves to be a good choice.\r
It is further interesting to note that the de\u0002pendence of hN(c)i on c in (2), is the same as the\r
asymptotic form of the cumulative distribution\r
of a χ\r

And the bound has been replaced by a ‘≈’\r

The probability described by eq. (5) has a nat\u0002ural interpretation. It is the same as one would\r
have for a random variable that is the maximal\r
of n independent χ\r
2\r
s+1 variates and one χ\r

2\r
s+1 i = 1...n, E[n] = N\r
then the tail probability P(y > c) for large c\r
is given by the right hand side of (5).\r
Intuitively, this suggests that we can view the\r
range of θ as being composed of several (on aver\u0002age N ) independent regions , where in each one\r
the likelihood fit involves an extra degree of free\u0002dom due to the variable mass, leading to a χ\r
2\r

distribution. The χ\r
2\r
s\r
term accounts for the pos\u0002sibility of having a local maximum on the edge\r
of the allowed region (assuming, from symme\u0002try reasons, that each edge has a probability 1/2\r
of being a local maximum). The number N can\r
therefore be interpreted as an ‘effective number’\r
of independent search regions.\r
We remark that exactly such an intuitive rea\u0002soning was employed by Quayle [8] as a conjec\u0002ture for the distribution of q(\r

that the distribution of a random variable de\u0002fined according to (7) reproduces, to a good ap\u0002proximation, that of q(\r

behavior is expected and the conjecture is in fact\r
a limiting case of Davies’ formula (1)."""

We shall now illustrate the procedure described\r
above with a simple example. Our toy model\r
consists of a gaussian signal (‘mass bump’) on\r
top of a continuous background that follows a\r
Rayleigh distribution, in a mass range [0,120].\r
The width of the gaussian increases linearly with\r
the mass, representing a case where the mass res\u0002olution changes with the mass.\r
We assume that the background shape is known\r
but its normalization is not, so that it is a free\r
parameter in the fit (i.e. a nuisance parameter),\r
together with the signal location and normaliza\u0002tion. We use a binned profile likelihood ratio as\r
our test statistic, where the number of events in\r
each bin is assumed to be Poisson distributed\r
with an expected value\r
E(ni) = µsi(m) + βbi (13)\r
where µ is the signal strength parameter, si(m)\r
corresponds to a gaussian located at a mass m, β\r
is the background normalization and bi are fixed\r
and given by the Rayleigh distribution. For sim\u0002plicity of notation we will use in the following\r
s = {si} and b = {βbi}. The hypothesis that no\r
signal exists, or equivalently that µ = 0, will be\r
referred to as the null hypothesis, H0. ˆµ and bˆ\r
will denote maximum likelihood estimators while\r
ˆ\r
bˆ will denote the conditional maximum likeli\u0002hood estimator of the background normalization\r
under the null hypothesis.\r
The test statistic q(m) is defined as:\r
q(m) = −2ln L(b\r

L(ˆµs(m) + bˆ)\r

where L is the likelihood function. An example\r
background-only pseudo-experiment is shown in\r

We choose a reference level of c0 = 0.5 and\r
estimate the expected number of upcrossings, as\r
demonstrated in Fig.1, from a set of 100 Monte\r
Carlo simulations of background experiments. This\r
gives hN(c0)i = 4.34 ± 0.11, which corresponds\r
to N = 5.58 ± 0.14. The distribution of q( ˆm)\r
is then estimated from a sample of ∼1 million\r
background simulations and we compare the tail\r
probabilities to the prediction of (3). The results\r
are shown in Fig.2. The bound of (3) gives an ex\u0002cellent approximation to the observed p-values\r
