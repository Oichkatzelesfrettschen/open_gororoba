Abstract\r
We review the motivation, construction and physical interpretation of a\r
semi-finite spectral triple obtained through a rearrangement of central ele\u0002ments of loop quantum gravity. The triple is based on a countable set of\r
oriented graphs and the algebra consists of generalized holonomy loops in\r
this set. The Dirac type operator resembles a global functional derivation\r
operator and the interaction between the algebra of holonomy loops and the\r
Dirac type operator reproduces the structure of a quantized Poisson bracket\r
of general relativity. Finally we give a heuristic argument as to how a nat\u0002ural candidate for a quantized Hamiltonian might emerge from this spectral\r
triple construction.\r

1 Introduction\r
Noncommutative geometry [1] has proven a remarkable successful framework for\r
understanding the geometrical nature of the standard model of particle physics.\r
The pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the standard model\r
grounds on the observation that the Dirac operator on a compact manifold to\u0002gether with its interaction with the smooth functions on the manifold and its rep\u0002resentation on square integrable spinors completely characterizes the Riemannian\r
structure. This leads to the notion of a spectral triple pA, H, Dq, where H is a\r
separable Hilbert space, A is a commutative involutive algebra represented in H\r
and D is a self-adjoint operator in H and where A and D has to satisfy certain\r
conditions. Moreover, these conditions are naturally extended to encompass also\r
noncommutative algebras. This generalization turns out to be the right framework\r
to formulate the standard model coupled to general relativity as a single gravita\u0002tional theory [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, the classical action of the standard\r
model coupled to gravity emerges from a spectral action principle applied to an al\u0002gebra which is a noncommutative modification of the algebra of smooth functions\r
over M [4, 5, 6]. In this formulation the additional interactions (strong, electro\u0002weak) emerge through inner fluctuations of D generated by the noncommutativity\r
of the algebra.\r
This beautiful formulation of fundamental physics raises the question whether\r
quantum field theory, too, has a natural translation into the language of non\u0002commutative geometry. The standard model, after all, is a quantum field theory.\r
When formulated in terms of noncommutative geometry one recovers, however,\r
essentially its classical formulation. Moreover, the action of the standard model\r
emerges as an integrated part of a gravitational theory. Therefore, it appears plau\u0002sible that if a natural intersection between quantum field theory and noncommu\u0002tative geometry exist, then it should involve aspects of quantum gravity.\r
This line of reasoning is the motivation behind a programme [10, 11, 12, 13,\r
14] which we initiated in 2005 and which will be the topic here. Basically, the idea\r
is to adopt a top-down approach to quantum gravity by applying elements of non\u0002commutative geometry to a quantum gravity setup. In particular, we take inspira\u0002tion from loop quantum gravity [15, 16, 17], which is based on Ashtekars formula\u0002tion of general relativity as a gauge field theory. However, whereas loop quantum\r
gravity is based on an algebra of Wilson loops of the Ashtekar gauge fields, the\r
idea here is to consider instead the algebra of holonomy loops. Since this algebra\r
is intrinsically noncommutative we are immediately situated well within the do\u0002main of noncommutative geometry. To complete the analogy we construct a Dirac\r
2

type operator and require its interaction with this algebra of holonomies to repro\u0002duce the quantized Poisson structure of general relativity. Since holonomy loops\r
are functions over connections this Dirac type operator will resemble a functional\r
derivation operator over a space of connections.\r
The aim of this project is twofold. First, we aim to identify canonical struc\u0002tures and principles which may help to define a theory of quantum gravity at\r
a quantized level and thereby avoid the ambiguities which plague the standard\r
quantization procedure. A Dirac type operator represents exactly such a canon\u0002ical structure. The hope is that this operator and its interaction with the algebra\r
of holonomy loops will cast light on the dynamics of quantum gravity. Indeed,\r
in the last part of this paper we present a heuristic argument as to how a candi\u0002date for the Hamiltonian of quantum gravity may emerge from this spectral triple\r
construction.\r
Second, the presence of inner automorphisms – due to noncommutativity of\r
the algebra – will in general introduce an additional gauge sector. In Connes for\u0002mulation of the standard model the entire bosonic sector arises through such in\u0002ner automorphisms. Since the algebra of holonomy loops is noncommutative this\r
mechanism will also apply to the spectral triple construction discussed here. Thus,\r
although this construction grounds on a purely gravitational setup – Ashtekars for\u0002mulation of general relativity – it will be a framework of quantum gravity which\r
simultaneous includes a basic mechanism of unification. Put differently, it seems\r
plausible that the construction cannot be a framework for pure quantum gravity.\r
Clearly, we would like to interpret this ”extra” in terms of matter degrees of free\u0002dom. Whether such an interpretation is valid can only be determined through a\r
semi-classical analysis.\r
The spectral triple construction involves several characteristics of quantum\r
field theory. For instance, the spectral action functional, which is finite, resembles\r
a Feynman integral over a space of connections. Also, the construction of the\r
Dirac type operator naturally entails the canonical commutations relations (CAR)\r
algebra, a hint at fermionic quantum field theory. The significance of these obser\u0002vations remains to be clarified.\r
The note is organized as follows: in section 2 we first give a brief introduction\r
to loop quantum gravity with emphasis on topics which we will use in the follow\u0002ing. In section 3 we present the general idea of the programme and in section 4\r
we provide the basic details of the spectral triple construction. Sections 5 to 8 are\r
concerned with the physical interpretation of the construction.\r

2 Loop quantum gravity and spaces of connections\r
Loop quantum gravity is based on Ashtekars formulation of general relativity in\r
terms of gauge field variables [18, 19]. Upon selecting a foliation of the four\r
dimensional manifold M \u0010 R \u0002 Σ, where Σ is a three dimensional hypersurface,\r
the Ashtekar variables are given by a S Up2q-connection A\r
i\r
ν\r
pxq and the inverse,\r
densitized dreibein E\r
µ\r
j\r
pxq, both fields on the hypersurface Σ. The connection is\r
related to the extrinsic curvature of Σ in M and the dreibein is given by the intrinsic\r
geometry of Σ. These are conjugate variables and satisfy the Poisson structure\r

These variables are subjected to three constraints, namely the Gauß-, Diffeo\u0002morphism- and Hamilton Constraints. In one version the Hamilton constraint is\r
of the form4\r

where F is the field strength tensor of A.\r
A key step in loop quantum gravity is the shift of variables from the set pA, Eq\r
to a dual set of variables given by holonomies of A and fluxes of E. Therefore,\r
consider curves γ in Σ and the holonomy transforms\r
hγpAq \u0010 Holpγ, Aq\r
of A along γ, and surfaces S in Σ and the fluxes\r

where γ \u0010 γ1 \u0004 γ2 intersects S in the point γ1 X γ2 (see figure) and where the sign\r
corresponds to different orientation of the surface S relative to γ.\r
This change of variables is crucial since it permits a reduction of the quan\u0002tization procedure to a projective system of finite problems related to oriented\r

In the following we shall ignore issues regarding the signature of space-time and the reality\r
of the Irmirzi parameter which we set equal to one. Also, for simplicity we choose here a constant\r
lapse field.\r

graphs. Specifically, consider first a finite number of holonomy transforms along\r
connected curves tγiu in Σ. The union of these curves is a graph Γ. We call the\r
intersection points of the curves for vertices tvju in Γ and the curves between ver\u0002tices for edges t\u000Fku. If we denote by A the space of smooth S Up2q connections\r
on Σ and consider the restriction of A to Γ, in terms of holonomies of connections\r
along curves, then we see that A reduces to the space\r
AΓ :\u0010 G\r
npΓq\r
,\r
where npΓq is the number of edges in Γ. Here each copy of G corresponds to the\r
holonomy transform along an edge in Γ.\r
Consider now the full system of all such piece-wise analytic graphs and their\r
associated spaces G\r
npΓiq\r
Given two graphs Γ1  Γ2 there exist projections between their associated spaces\r
PΓ2;Γ1: AΓ2 Ñ AΓ1.\r
For example, take the two first graphs in the previous figure. The corresponding\r
spaces are given by AΓ1 \u0010 G and AΓ2 \u0010 G\r
4\r
and the projection between them\r
reads (with labeling of edges from left to right)\r
PΓ2;Γ1pg1, g2, g3, g4q \u0010 g1 \u0004 g3 .\r
A key result by Ashtekar and Lewandowski [20, 21] is that the space A of smooth\r
connections is densely embedded in the projective limit of spaces tAΓu, that is\r
A ãÑ lim\r
Ð\r
AΓ \u0010: A\r
a\r
. (4)\r
Thus A\r
a\r
can be considered as a completion of the space of connections. The main\r
advantage of A\r
a\r
is that it possesses a natural measure, the Ashtekar-Lewandowski\r
measure. This measure is simply the inductive limit of Haar measures over spaces\r
5

AΓ. The Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q is the inductive limit of Hilbert spaces L\r
2\r
pAΓq.\r
This is the kinematical Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity, denoted Hkin, and\r
forms the basis of the theory. The quantized holonomy and flux operators hˆ\r
L\r
and Fˆ\r
S can be constructed as multiplication and derivation operators in Hkin and\r
one can impose the constraints as operator constraints and thereby, in principle,\r
attempt to obtain the physical Hilbert space by solving these constraints.\r
It is important to notice that Hkin is non-separable. This fact is the first in\u0002dication that a spectral construction involving this Hilbert space will be hard to\r
achieve.\r
3 The project; idea and strategy\r
The aim of our project is to construct a spectral triple over an algebra of holonomy\r
loops. This algebra is intrinsically noncommutative and the hope is that this non\u0002commutativity will entail additional structure much alike the structures generated\r
by the matrix factor in Connes’ formulation of the standard model.\r
With an algebra of holonomy transforms, which we view as maps\r
γ : ∇ Ñ Holpγ, ∇q P MlpCq ,\r
where l is the size of a matrix representation of G and where ∇ P A, it is clear that\r
a spectral triple involving such an algebra will be a geometrical construction over\r
the space of connection. That is, the space of states on the algebra will be related\r
to the space A. Accordingly, the Dirac type operator in such a triple must have an\r
interpretation in terms of functional derivations.\r
The strategy to obtain such a construction is to exploit the pro-manifold struc\u0002ture of A. That is, since A is densely embedded in A\r
a\r
which is the projective limit\r
of manifolds we aim to construct first geometrical structures over these interme\u0002diate manifolds and subsequently to take their projective and inductive limits over\r
a suitable system of graphs. Thus, the programme involves the following three\r
steps:\r
# 1: construct spectral triples pBΓ, DΓ, HΓq at the level of a finite graphs Γ, with\r
BΓ being the algebra of holonomy loops, now generated by loops restricted\r
to the graph Γ. This step is conceptually easy since AΓ is a compact Lie\u0002group with a Haar measure which gives us a natural Hilbert space and can\u0002didates for a Dirac operator;\r
6

# 2: ensure compatibility with the structure maps\r
PΓΓ1 : AΓ Ñ AΓ\r
1 ,\r
and their enduced maps between Hilbert spaces L\r
2\r
pAΓq and L\r
2\r
pAΓ\r
1q. For\r
example, we require\r
PΓΓ1 \u0005 DΓ \u0010 DΓ\r
1 \u0005 PΓΓ1 ;\r
# 3: take the projective and inductive limit of the triples pBΓ, DΓ, HΓq over all\r
graphs in the inductive system of graphs. Hereby we obtain a candidate for\r
a spectral triple over the full space of connections.\r
This programme was first formulated in [10] where we analyzed the possi\u0002bility to construct a spectral triple based on the projective system of piece-wise\r
analytic graphs used in loop quantum gravity. However, we found this project un\u0002likely to succeed due to the large number of constraints coming from the different\r
projections between embedded graphs. These constraints restrict the Dirac type\r
operator considerably, and for the loop quantum gravity-setup we were unable to\r
solve them.\r
To overcome these difficulties we have, in a recent series of publications [12,\r
13, 14], adopted a new strategy where we instead consider a more restricted sys\u0002tem of graphs. Examples of these restricted systems of graphs are simplicial com\u0002plexes/triangulations and their barycentric subdivisions, and hyper-lattices and\r
their sub-lattices obtained by subdividing each cell symmetrically. These exam\u0002ples all permit a spectral triple construction with interesting properties.\r
4 The construction\r
We now give an outline of the construction of the algebra of holonomy loops and\r
the spectral triple. In the following we work with simplicial complexes and their\r
barycentric subdivisions. The construction based on lattices and their symmetric\r
subdivisions is obtained in the same way.\r
# 1: A spectral triple associated to a single graph\r
First, let Γ be a finite d-dim simplicial complex with oriented edges t\u000Fiu and\r
vertices tviu, where\r
\u000Fj: t0, 1u Ñ tviu .\r

Assign to each edge \u000Fi a group element gi P G\r
∇ : \u000Fi Ñ gi,\r
where G is a compact Lie-group. Notice that the space of such\r
maps, denoted AΓ, has the form\r
AΓ \u0014 G\r
n\r
,\r
since\r
AΓ Q ∇ Ñ p∇p\u000F1q, . . . , ∇p\u000Fnqq P G\r

.\r
The Algebra: A loop L in Γ is a finite oriented sequence of connected edges,\r
L \u0010 t\u000Fi1, \u000Fi2, . . . , \u000Finu, with \u000Fi1p0q \u0010 \u000Finp1q. We choose a fixed basepoint v0 P tviu\r
and discard trivial backtracking of loops. The product between two loops is given\r
by gluing them at the basepoint\r
L1 \u0005 L2 \u0010 tL1, L2u ,\r
and the inversion of a loop is given by reversal\r

where the norm on the rhs is the matrix norm in G. Let BΓ be the C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra\r
generated by the Li’s in this norm and let BΓ be the \u0006-sub-algebra of BΓ generated\r
by the Li’s. We will call this algebra the loop algebra.\r
The Hilbert space: The next step is to consider representations of the loop alge\u0002bra. In fact, there is a natural Hilbert space\r
HΓ \u0010 L\r
2\r
pG\r
n\r
,ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q b MlpCqq , (5)\r
which involves the Clifford bundle over G\r
n\r
. Here L\r
2\r
is with respect to the Haar\r
measure on G\r
n\r
and l is again the size of the representation of G. The reason for\r
adding these two factors – the Clifford bundle and the matrix factor – in (5) is to\r
accommodate the Dirac operator and the algebra of holonomy loops, respectively.\r
The loop algebra BΓ has a natural representation on HΓ given by\r
hL \u0004 ψp∇q \u0010 p1 b ∇pLqq \u0004 ψp∇q , ψ P H ,\r
where the first factor acts on the Clifford-part of the Hilbert space and the second\r
factor acts by matrix multiplication on the matrix part of the Hilbert space. For\r
example, the action of the loop\r

hL \u0012 g2 \u0004 g3 \u0004 pg1q\r
\u00011\r
on elements in HΓ.\r
The Dirac operator: Since G\r
n\r
is a classical geometry we can simply pick a Dirac\r
operator DΓ on G\r
n\r
and hereby obtain a candidate for a spectral triple\r
pBΓ, HΓ, DΓq ,\r
on the level of the graph Γ. The choice of the Dirac operator is, at this point,\r
largely free.\r

# 2: Compatibility with the structure maps\r
Consider now a system of nested simplicial complexes\r
Γ0 Ñ Γ1 Ñ Γ2 Ñ . . . ,\r
where Γiis the barycentric subdivision of Γi\u00011. For the corresponding spaces AΓi\r
we obtain a system\r
AΓ0 ÐÝ\r
P10 AΓ1 ÐÝ\r
P21 AΓ2 ÐÝ\r
P32\r
. . . ,\r
where the arrows are projections between the spaces AΓi \u0014 G\r
npΓiq\r
. The aim is to\r
obtain a system of spectral triples\r
pBΓ0, HΓ0, DΓ0q Ø pBΓ1, HΓ1, DΓ1q Ø pBΓ2, HΓ2, DΓ2q Ø . . . , (6)\r
where the arrows indicate compatibility with the structure maps. It turns out that\r
the required compatibility is automatic for the algebra, and is easily obtained for\r
the Hilbert space. For the Dirac operator, however, this requirement strongly re\u0002stricts the form of permissible operators.\r
G G\r
G\r
P\r
Essentially, the problem of solving the compatibility\r
conditions boils down to the simple case where we have\r
a single edge which is subdivided into two edges. This\r
corresponds to the projection\r
P : G\r
2 Ñ G , Ppg1, g2q \u0010 g1 \u0004 g2 , (7)\r
and a corresponding map between Hilbert spaces\r
P\r

pG,ClpT\r
\u0006Gq b Mlq Ñ L2\r
pG\r
2\r
,ClpT\r
\u0006Gq b Mlq ,\r
which leads to the compatibility condition\r

\u0006\r
vqpg1, g2q , v P L\r
2\r
pG,ClpT\r
\u0006Gq b Mlq (8)\r
for the Dirac operator. Here D1 denotes a Dirac operator on G, and D2 denotes a\r
Dirac operator on G\r
2\r
. In the papers [13, 14] we have found two different solutions\r
to this compatibility condition. Since the solution described in [13] is considerably\r
more complicated than the solution described in [14] we shall here describe the\r
latter. Consider therefore the following change of variables\r
Θ : G\r
2 Ñ G2\r
;pg1, g2q Ñ pg1 \u0004 g2, g2q \u0010: pg\r
1\r
1\r
, g\r
1\r
2\r
q ,\r
10

which changes the projection (7) into the simple form\r
Ppg\r
1\r
1\r
, g\r
1\r
2\r
q \u0010 g\r
1\r
1\r
. (9)\r
It is now straight forward to write down a Dirac operator on G\r
2 which is com\u0002patible with the projection (9). Basically, we can pick any Dirac operator of the\r
form\r
D2 \u0010 D1  aD1\r
2\r
, a P R , (10)\r
where D\r
1\r
2\r
is a Dirac operator on the copy of G in G\r
2 whose coordinates are elim\u0002inated by the projection (9). At this point the choice of the operator D\r
1\r
2\r
is essen\u0002tially unrestricted with a being an arbitrary real parameter. However, for reasons\r
explained in [14] it turns out that D1 and D\r
1\r
2\r
should of the form\r
Di \u0010\r
¸\r
i,a\r
e\r
a\r
i\r
\u0004 de\r
a\r
i\r
, (11)\r
where e\r
a\r
i\r
denotes a complete set of left-invariant vector fields in TGi, a is a S Up2q\r
index, and the product in (11) is Clifford multiplication.\r
This line of analysis is straightforwardly generalized to repeated subdivisions\r
and gives rise to a series of free parameters taiu, one for each subdivision. By\r
solving the G\r
2 Ñ G problem repeatedly, and by piecing together the different\r
edges, we end up with a Dirac-like operator on the level of Γn of the general form\r
DΓn \u0010\r
¸\r
k\r
akDk, (12)\r
where Dkis a Dirac type operator corresponding to the k’th level. As already\r
mentioned, there are several possible Dirac operators which satisfy condition (8).\r
However, all solutions will be of the general form (12) which involves a sequence\r
of free parameters. The solution which we have outlined here and which is pub\u0002lished in [14] entails a Dirac type operator with an easily calculable spectrum.\r
# 3: The continuum limit\r
We are now ready to take the limit of the sequence (6). First, the Hilbert space\r
H is constructed by adding all the intermediate Hilbert spaces\r
H1 \u0010 `ΓL\r
2\r
pG\r
npΓq\r
,ClpT\r
\u0006GnpΓq\r
q b MlpCqq{N ,\r
11

where N is the subspace generated by elements of the form\r
p. . . , v, . . . , \u0001P\r
\u0006\r
i jpvq, . . .q ,\r
where P\r
\u0006\r
i j are the induced maps between Hilbert spaces. The Hilbert space H\r
is the completion of H1. The inner product on H is the inductive limit inner\r
product. This Hilbert space is manifestly separable.\r
In fact, the Hilbert space H is constructed in the same way as the kinemati\u0002cal Hilbert space in loop quantum gravity. If we ignore the Clifford bundle, then\r
the only difference between H and the kinematical Hilbert space is the choice\r
of graphs, triangulations vs. piece-wise analytic, which corresponds to the sep\u0002arability of H and the non-separability of the kinematical Hilbert space of loop\r
quantum gravity. We shall discuss this issue in section 5.1.\r
Next, the algebra\r
B :\u0010 limΓ ÝÑBΓ\r
contains loops defined on a simplicial complex Γn in tΓnu. Again, the algebra B\r
is separable. Finally, the Dirac-like operator DΓndescends to a densely defined\r
operator on the limit space H\r
D \u0010 limΓ ÝÑDΓn.\r
In [13] we prove5that for a compact Lie-group G the triple pB, H, Dq is a\r
semi-finite spectral triple, which means that:\r
1. D’s resolvent p1  D\r
2\r
\r
q\r

2. the commutator rD, as is bounded,\r
provided the sequence taiu approaches 8 sufficiently fast.\r
The term semi-finite means, in this case, that the resolvent of D is in fact not\r
compact. Instead, the degeneracy of each eigenvalue is finite with respect to a\r
certain trace and the resolvent is compact with respect to this trace. The trace is\r
the ordinary operator trace on operators in L\r

5To be precise, we prove in [13] that a semi-finite spectral triple exist for all compact Lie\u0002groups but that certain deviations to the form described here may be required. For S Up2q these\r
deviations are not necessary.\r

For the case G \u0010 Up1q we find that the sequence tanu is required to satisfy\r
an \u0010 2\r
n\r
bn , where lim\r
nÑ8\r
bn \u0010 8 .\r
The exact restrictions on the sequence tanu for arbitrary G may depend on which\r
Dirac-type operator one chooses.\r
5 Spaces of connections\r
Let us now turn to the spaces AΓ and their projective limit. Denote by\r
A\r
\r
:\u0010 limΓ ÐÝAΓ .\r
It turns out that the limit space A\r
\r
is a space of generalized connections which\r
means that the space A of smooth connections is densely embedded in A\r
\r
. This\r
result mirrors the fundamental result of loop quantum gravity mentioned in section\r
2 (see equation (4)).\r
To see that A\r
\r
contains all smooth connections we first need to map the graphs\r
tΓju into a manifold M\r
h : Γj Ñ Γj P M .\r
Then there is a natural map\r
χ : A Ñ A\r
\r
, χp∇qp\u000Fiq \u0010 Holp∇, \u000Fiq ,\r
where Holp∇, \u000Fiq is again the holonomy of ∇ along \u000Fi which is now in M. In fact,\r
χ is an embedding\r
A ãÑ A\r
\r
.\r
m\r
\u000Fi\r
U\r
To see this consider two different connections ∇1, ∇2 P\r
A which differ in a point m P M and therefore in a\r
neighborhood U of m. Choose a small edge \u000Fiin a\r
graphs Γj so that \u000Fi P U. Then\r
Holp∇1, \u000Fiq , Holp∇2, \u000Fiq .\r
This shows exactly that A\r
\r
contains all smooth connec\u0002tions. Furthermore, the image of χ is dense in A\r
\r
, see\r
13

[13]. These result suggests that the Dirac type operator is a kind of functional\r
derivation operator over A\r
D \u0012\r

.\r
In fact, D is a global operator of the heuristic form\r
D \u0012\r

where ∇pxq represents a degree of freedom in each point.\r
Furthermore, the inner product of the Hilbert space is a functional integral\r
over A\r
xΨ|...|Ψy \u0012 »\r
A\r
\r
rd∇sTr . . . .\r
In total, these observations suggest that the spectral triple construction should be\r
interpreted in terms of quantum field theory.\r
5.1 Comparison to loop quantum gravity\r
As already mentioned, loop quantum gravity operates with the space A\r
a\r
of gen\u0002eralized connections based on a projective system of piecewise analytic graphs.\r
Thus, there are now two different completions6 of the space A of smooth connec\u0002tions: A\r
a\r
and A\r
\r
with\r
A ãÑ A\r
a\r
, A ãÑ A\r
\r
.\r
The difference between these completions is their corresponding symmetry groups:\r
1. In loop quantum gravity the group of analytic diffeomorphisms act as a\r
symmetry group,\r
2. In the present case we have a much smaller symmetry group of graph auto\u0002morphisms which we denote by Diffp4q.\r
6\r
In fact, there are many completions of A, one for each set of graphs which satisfy certain\r
’density’ conditions [13].\r
14

We observe the following hierachy:\r
A : - action of diffpMq\r
- no Hilbert space structure\r
- no Dirac-like operator\r
A\r
a\r
: - action of (analytic) diffpMq\r
- Hilbert space structure (non-separable)\r
- no Dirac-like operator\r
A\r
\r
: - no action of diffpMq (few discrete)\r
- Hilbert space structure (separable)\r
- Dirac-like operator\r
It appears that the use of a restricted system of graphs (simplicial complexes, cubic\r
lattices or something else) corresponds to a kind of (partial) gauge fixing of the\r
diffeomorphism group. There is, however, an alternative interpretation. Notice\r
that a triangulation Γ is also a piecewise analytic graph7\r
. This means that there is\r
a natural embedding between the Hilbert spaces\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q\r
ι\r
ãÑ L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q ,\r
where we for now discard the Clifford bundle and the matrix factor from H.\r
Furthermore, in loop quantum gravity there is the Hilbert space Hdi f f of (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism invariant states. That is, there exist a surjection\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q\r
qÑ Hdi f f .\r
We therefore get a map\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q\r
Ξ ÝÑ Hdi f f ,\r
and obtain the diagram:\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q\r
ι\r
Õ Ó q\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q\r
Ξ ÝÑ Hdi f f\r
The amount by which the map Ξ fails to be injective can be thought of as a defi\u0002nition of the symmetry group diffp4q of graph automorphisms.\r
7\r
If we choose the triangulation to be piece-wise analytic.\r
15

This suggests that H is directly related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeo\u0002morphism invariant states known from loop quantum gravity. In this picture we\r
can therefore think of a holonomy loop in B as an equivalence class of holonomy\r
loops, up to diffeomorphisms.\r
There are several unresolved issues here. For example, it seems that there is\r
an important difference between the system of cubic lattices and the system of\r
triangulations: The valence number of vertices in the first case is always fixed, de\u0002termined by the dimension of the manifold M, whereas the valence of vertices in\r
the case of triangulations diverges. Thus, for the map Ξ to be surjective we prob\u0002ably must require the valence of vertices to approach infinity. The exact relation\r
between the Hilbert spaces H and Hdi f f remains to be analyzed.\r
6 The Poisson structure of general relativity\r
The aim of this section is to show that the spectral triple construction quantizes\r
the Poisson bracket (3). To see this we first calculate the commutator between the\r
Dirac type operator D and an element of the algebra B. Take first a single group\r
element g corresponding to the i\r
1\r
th copy of G in G\r
n\r
. We find (for simplicity we\r
set ai \u0010 1)\r
rD, gs \u0010 ¸\r
k\r
p \b gσkq \u0004 ek\r
, (14)\r
where ek P ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q and σkis a certain generator of the Lie algebra g. Next, the\r
commutator between D and the element hL \u0012 gi1\u0004 gi2. . . gikis\r
rD, hLs \u0010 rD, gi1sgi2. . . gik  gi1rD, gi2s. . . gik  . . . , (15)\r
which shows that the action of D is to insert Lie-algebra generators at each vertex\r
in the loop. Already here we notice a resemblance to the bracket (3) which also\r
prescribes insertions of Lie-algebra generators into the holonomy loop.\r
In fact, if we omit the part which involves Clifford multiplication with the\r
elements ek P ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q then the bracket given by (14) and (15) is essentially a\r
quantized version of the Poisson bracket (3). Here the holonomy loops belong to\r
B and the corresponding flux operators, which are now located at the vertices in\r
the graphs tΓiu, corresponds to the left-invariant vector fields used to construct the\r
Dirac type operator D. These left-invariant vector fields should be interpreted as\r
flux operators corresponding to infinitesimal surfaces located at the endpoints of\r
the edges carrying the copies of G on which the vector fields act. This implies\r
16

that the Dirac type operator D can be written as a sum of all the flux operators\r
located at the vertices in the family of graphs tΓiu.\r
This shows that the spectral triple construction captures information tanta\u0002mount to a representation of the Poisson brackets of general relativity. The com\u0002bination of the algebra of holonomy loops and the Dirac type operator involves\r
both conjugate variables. The main difference to the representation used in loop\r
quantum gravity is the choice of graphs. It is important to keep in mind that the\r
system of graphs which we use here is dense in a double sense: the set of vertices\r
tviu is a dense set in M and the space of smooth connections is densely embedded\r
in A\r
\r
.\r
If we interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism constraint, then we can think of our construction as a quantiza\u0002tion scheme which deals first with the constraints (partially) and next with the\r
quantization. That is, a quantization scheme which deviates from the standard\r
Dirac-type quantization procedure.\r
7 The square of D\r
In loop quantum gravity the area operators play an important role. Given a\r
surface S in M the associated area operator reads [22]\r
ApS q \u0010 ¸\r
n\r
b\r
Fˆi\r
S n\r
Fˆ\r
j\r
S n\r
δi j .\r
where S \u0010\r
\r
n\r
S n. Since the area operators are functionals of the flux operators,\r
and since we have just argued that the Dirac type operator D has the form of a\r
sum of flux operators, it is natural to ask which role area operators plays in the\r
spectral triple construction discussed here. What we find is that the square of the\r
Dirac type operator D has the form of a kind of global area operator. To see this\r
it suffices to note that the square of D will, to leading order, be a sum of flux\r
operators squared. Thus, we find that\r
D\r
2\r
 \u0012\r
¸\r
v\r
. . . ApS vq \u0012 »\r
Σ\r
Apxq , (16)\r
where the sum runs over vertices tviu and where Apxq is a kind of area density\r
squared operator. The integral over Σ in (17) should be understood in the sense\r
that the sum °\r
v\r
runs over all vertices in tΓiu which is a dense set in M.\r
17

It remains to understand exactly which classical interpretation the operator D\r
2\r
\r
should be given.\r
The spectral action functional\r
Let us here also mention that the spectral action functional – the operator trace\r
over the heat-kernel – resembles a Feynman integral\r
T r expp\u0001spDq\r
2\r
q \u0012 »\r
A\r
\r
rd∇s exp \u0001spDq\r
2\r
\b\r
δ∇p∇q ,\r
where D\r
2\r
 plays the role of a kind of action or an energy. This object is, for suitable\r
sequences tanu, finite. Notice also that this object is well defined for any compact\r
group G and any dimension of the underlying manifold M. It is an interesting\r
question if this bears any relation to ordinary quantum field theory.\r
8 The Hamiltonian\r
A key motivation for constructing the operator D is to find canonical structures\r
at a quantized level. The spectral action construction represents a top-down ap\u0002proach to quantum gravity. This means that the relevant question is not ”how to\r
quantize” certain structures but rather how to obtain a semi-classical analysis once\r
the construction is completed.\r
Thus, a relevant question is whether the spectral triple construction has any\u0002thing to say about the dynamics of quantum gravity? Does it contain information\r
about the Hamiltonian of general relativity? In the following we will attempt to\r
answer this question with an argument as to how a candidate for a Hamilton con\u0002straint might arise from the spectral triple construction.\r
We start with a fluctuation of the Dirac operator. This is generally of the form\r
D˜\r
 \u0010 D  W ,\r
where W \u0010 arD, bs is a noncommutative 1-form and where a and b are elements\r
of the algebra. W parametrizes a freedom of choosing the Dirac type operator D\r
and should be interpreted as a kind of gauge potential over the space A\r
\r
. Consider\r
now the square of the fluctuated operator\r
D˜\r
2\r
 \u0010 D\r
2\r
  pD˜\r
2\r
 \u0001 D\r
2\r
\r
q \u0010 D\r
2\r
  FW , (17)\r
18

where FW \u0010 tD, Wu 1\r
2\r
tW, Wu. We now propose that the quantized Hamiltonian\r
constraint should be of the form\r
TrpFWΨq \u0010 0 . (18)\r
Here, Tr is with respect to S Up2q. Heuristically, this expression has the right\r
form. To see this we first expand the loop L according to\r
L \u0012 1  α\r
2F  \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 ,\r
where α\r
2\r
is the area expanded by the ”small” loop and F is the field strength\r
tensor of the Ashtekar connection. Furthermore, D is heuristically of the form\r
D \u0010\r
»\r
Σ\r
dxe\r
i\r
j\r
pxq \u0004 Eˆ\r
j\r
i\r
pxq ,\r
which can be seen from (13) and from the fact that the sum runs over a dense set\r
in M. Here e\r
i\r
j\r
pxq represents again an element in the Clifford bundle. When we\r
combine these expressions we obtain, to second order in α, the following:\r
TrpD˜\r

However the anti commutator of e\r

pxq and e\r
k\r
l\r
pyq will produce a delta function in\r
x \u0001 y, and we get an expression similar to\r

pxqEˆ\r

i\r
pxq ,\r
which has the same structure as (8) and therefore resembles a quantization of the\r
Hamilton constraint.\r
It is important to emphasize that this argument, in its present form, only works\r
at a heuristic level. We expect that much can be added to the argument in the form\r
of additional structure. For instance, when discussing fluctuation of the Dirac op\u0002erator one should also consider a real structure, which, at present, has not been\r
analyzed nor constructed. Furthermore, a rigorous semiclassical analysis is nec\u0002essary to fully estimate the significance of an expression like (18).\r
However, it is clear that once the spectral triple pB, H, Dq is constructed,\r
then an object like expression (17) and the constraint (18) are canonical and free of\r
the ordering ambiguities which one encounters in a standard quantization scheme.\r
Also, these expression require no regularization. This indicates that a spectral\r
triple construction like the one discussed here might indeed help define a canonical\r
theory of quantum gravity.\r
19

9 The sequence taiu\r
ai\r
ai1\r
ai2\r
Recall that the Dirac operator D depends on a se\u0002quence taiu of real parameters. To understand and\r
interpret the spectral triple construction it is neces\u0002sary to understand the significance of these parame\u0002ters.\r
First, the role of the parameters taiu is to set a\r
scale. Edges which lie ’deep’ in the inductive system\r
of graphs are assigned large a’s compared to edges\r
which lie ’higher’ (see figure). This means that a ’coarse grained’ loop corre\u0002sponds to small a’s whereas a ’refined’ loop corresponds to large a’s.\r
Therefore, when D probes a loop the eigenvalues corresponding to ’coarse’\r
information about the loop are weighted with smaller a’s compared to eigenvalues\r
which corresponds to more ’refined’ information.\r
It is the requirement of D to have compact resolvent which dictates this addi\u0002tional scaling degree of freedom. At present we have no clear interpretation of this\r
structure, except that this seems important in order to extract topological informa\u0002tion of the underlying manifold. Furthermore, such a scaling degree of freedom is\r
reminiscent of the renormalization group theory of lattice gauge theory.\r
There is in fact a natural choice for the a’s since they correspond to a split of\r
an edge in two. This suggest the sequence\r
an \u0010 2\r
n\r
.\r
However, although this sequence is divergent, it is in fact exactly the sequence\r
where D fails to be spectral. This means that infinities (for example, in the spec\u0002tral action functional) will arise for exactly this choice8\r
. Instead one could try\r
with the permissible sequence\r
an \u0010 p2  \u000Fq\r
n\r
,\r
and subsequently take the limit \u000F Ñ 0. One may speculate whether the infinities\r
which arise in this limit might somehow be related to the infinities one encounters\r
in the renormalization procedure of quantum field theory.\r
8This statement probably depends on the exact choice of Dirac type operator. We know it is\r
valid for the Dirac type operators constructed in [14].\r
20

10 Connes Distance Formula\r
Given a spectral triple pA, D, Hq over a manifold M Connes spectral distance for\u0002mula reads\r
dpξx, ξyq \u0010 sup\r
aPA\r
t|ξxpaq \u0001 ξypaq|||rD, as| ¤ 1u ,\r
where ξx, ξy are the evaluation homomorphisms A Ñ C in x, y and where dpξx, ξyq\r
is the geodesic distance between x and y on M given by metric structure of D. The\r
interesting observation, which is central to noncommutative geometry, is that this\r
distance formula can be straight forwardly generalized to noncommutative spaces\r
and algebras.\r
For us, the question therefore arises what Connes distance formula has to say\r
about the spectral triple construction which we discuss here. It turns out that\r
a distance formula which involves the algebra B and the Dirac type operator\r
D will provide us with a notion of distance on a space of field configurations.\r
The exact meaning of such a formula depends on the state-space of the algebra\r
B. Without going into detail let us here just state that two field configurations,\r
each given by a connection, will be ’far’ apart if they differ on a large scale and\r
’close’ if they differ by a short scale. The reason for this is again the sequence\r
tanu of scaling parameters. If the two field configurations differ on edges which\r
corresponds to small a’s – corresponding to large scales – then the corresponding\r
distance will be relatively smaller compared to edges which are assigned large a’s.\r
11 Conclussion\r
In this note we have outlined the motivation, construction and interpretation of the\r
spectral triple construction already presented in [12][13][14]. To recapitulate, the\r
semi-finite spectral triple pB, D, Hq consist of:\r
- the algebra B of holonomy loops,\r
- the Dirac type operator D which resembles a global functional derivation\r
operator,\r
- the Hilbert space H which is related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeo\u0002morphism invariant states.\r
Furthermore, the interaction between B and D encodes the quantized Poisson\r
structure of general relativity when formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables.\r
21

Technically, the triple is constructed as a projective/inductive limit of finite\r
dimensional spectral triples associated to oriented graphs. Also, the construction\r
of the spectral triple relies on a set taiu of scaling parameters. It is the correct\r
scaling behavior of these parameters which ensures that the construction meets\r
the requirements of a spectral triple.\r
Finally, we present an argument as to how a quantized Hamiltonian of general\r
relativity might emerge from a spectral triple construction like the one presented\r
here. This heuristic argument provides a new, top-down approach to the formula\u0002tion of a dynamical principle of quantum gravity.\r

Abstract\r
We review the motivation, construction and physical interpretation of a\r
semi-finite spectral triple obtained through a rearrangement of central ele\u0002ments of loop quantum gravity. The triple is based on a countable set of\r
oriented graphs and the algebra consists of generalized holonomy loops in\r
this set. The Dirac type operator resembles a global functional derivation\r
operator and the interaction between the algebra of holonomy loops and the\r
Dirac type operator reproduces the structure of a quantized Poisson bracket\r
of general relativity. Finally we give a heuristic argument as to how a nat\u0002ural candidate for a quantized Hamiltonian might emerge from this spectral\r
triple construction.\r

Noncommutative geometry [1] has proven a remarkable successful framework for\r
understanding the geometrical nature of the standard model of particle physics.\r
The pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the standard model\r
grounds on the observation that the Dirac operator on a compact manifold to\u0002gether with its interaction with the smooth functions on the manifold and its rep\u0002resentation on square integrable spinors completely characterizes the Riemannian\r
structure. This leads to the notion of a spectral triple pA, H, Dq, where H is a\r
separable Hilbert space, A is a commutative involutive algebra represented in H\r
and D is a self-adjoint operator in H and where A and D has to satisfy certain\r
conditions. Moreover, these conditions are naturally extended to encompass also\r
noncommutative algebras. This generalization turns out to be the right framework\r
to formulate the standard model coupled to general relativity as a single gravita\u0002tional theory [2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. In particular, the classical action of the standard\r
model coupled to gravity emerges from a spectral action principle applied to an al\u0002gebra which is a noncommutative modification of the algebra of smooth functions\r
over M [4, 5, 6]. In this formulation the additional interactions (strong, electro\u0002weak) emerge through inner fluctuations of D generated by the noncommutativity\r
of the algebra.\r
This beautiful formulation of fundamental physics raises the question whether\r
quantum field theory, too, has a natural translation into the language of non\u0002commutative geometry. The standard model, after all, is a quantum field theory.\r
When formulated in terms of noncommutative geometry one recovers, however,\r
essentially its classical formulation. Moreover, the action of the standard model\r
emerges as an integrated part of a gravitational theory. Therefore, it appears plau\u0002sible that if a natural intersection between quantum field theory and noncommu\u0002tative geometry exist, then it should involve aspects of quantum gravity.\r
This line of reasoning is the motivation behind a programme [10, 11, 12, 13,\r
14] which we initiated in 2005 and which will be the topic here. Basically, the idea\r
is to adopt a top-down approach to quantum gravity by applying elements of non\u0002commutative geometry to a quantum gravity setup. In particular, we take inspira\u0002tion from loop quantum gravity [15, 16, 17], which is based on Ashtekars formula\u0002tion of general relativity as a gauge field theory. However, whereas loop quantum\r
gravity is based on an algebra of Wilson loops of the Ashtekar gauge fields, the\r
idea here is to consider instead the algebra of holonomy loops. Since this algebra\r
is intrinsically noncommutative we are immediately situated well within the do\u0002main of noncommutative geometry. To complete the analogy we construct a Dirac\r
2

type operator and require its interaction with this algebra of holonomies to repro\u0002duce the quantized Poisson structure of general relativity. Since holonomy loops\r
are functions over connections this Dirac type operator will resemble a functional\r
derivation operator over a space of connections.\r
The aim of this project is twofold. First, we aim to identify canonical struc\u0002tures and principles which may help to define a theory of quantum gravity at\r
a quantized level and thereby avoid the ambiguities which plague the standard\r
quantization procedure. A Dirac type operator represents exactly such a canon\u0002ical structure. The hope is that this operator and its interaction with the algebra\r
of holonomy loops will cast light on the dynamics of quantum gravity. Indeed,\r
in the last part of this paper we present a heuristic argument as to how a candi\u0002date for the Hamiltonian of quantum gravity may emerge from this spectral triple\r
construction.\r
Second, the presence of inner automorphisms – due to noncommutativity of\r
the algebra – will in general introduce an additional gauge sector. In Connes for\u0002mulation of the standard model the entire bosonic sector arises through such in\u0002ner automorphisms. Since the algebra of holonomy loops is noncommutative this\r
mechanism will also apply to the spectral triple construction discussed here. Thus,\r
although this construction grounds on a purely gravitational setup – Ashtekars for\u0002mulation of general relativity – it will be a framework of quantum gravity which\r
simultaneous includes a basic mechanism of unification. Put differently, it seems\r
plausible that the construction cannot be a framework for pure quantum gravity.\r
Clearly, we would like to interpret this ”extra” in terms of matter degrees of free\u0002dom. Whether such an interpretation is valid can only be determined through a\r
semi-classical analysis.\r
The spectral triple construction involves several characteristics of quantum\r
field theory. For instance, the spectral action functional, which is finite, resembles\r
a Feynman integral over a space of connections. Also, the construction of the\r
Dirac type operator naturally entails the canonical commutations relations (CAR)\r
algebra, a hint at fermionic quantum field theory. The significance of these obser\u0002vations remains to be clarified.\r
The note is organized as follows: in section 2 we first give a brief introduction\r
to loop quantum gravity with emphasis on topics which we will use in the follow\u0002ing. In section 3 we present the general idea of the programme and in section 4\r
we provide the basic details of the spectral triple construction. Sections 5 to 8 are\r
concerned with the physical interpretation of the construction.\r

Loop quantum gravity is based on Ashtekars formulation of general relativity in\r
terms of gauge field variables [18, 19]. Upon selecting a foliation of the four\r
dimensional manifold M \u0010 R \u0002 Σ, where Σ is a three dimensional hypersurface,\r
the Ashtekar variables are given by a S Up2q-connection A\r

densitized dreibein E\r
µ\r

where F is the field strength tensor of A.\r
A key step in loop quantum gravity is the shift of variables from the set pA, Eq\r
to a dual set of variables given by holonomies of A and fluxes of E. Therefore,\r
consider curves γ in Σ and the holonomy transforms\r

connected curves tγiu in Σ. The union of these curves is a graph Γ. We call the\r
intersection points of the curves for vertices tvju in Γ and the curves between ver\u0002tices for edges t\u000Fku. If we denote by A the space of smooth S Up2q connections\r
on Σ and consider the restriction of A to Γ, in terms of holonomies of connections\r
along curves, then we see that A reduces to the space\r
AΓ :\u0010 G\r
npΓq\r
,\r
where npΓq is the number of edges in Γ. Here each copy of G corresponds to the\r
holonomy transform along an edge in Γ.\r
Consider now the full system of all such piece-wise analytic graphs and their\r
associated spaces G\r
npΓiq\r
Given two graphs Γ1  Γ2 there exist projections between their associated spaces\r
PΓ2;Γ1: AΓ2 Ñ AΓ1.\r
For example, take the two first graphs in the previous figure. The corresponding\r
spaces are given by AΓ1 \u0010 G and AΓ2 \u0010 G\r

and the projection between them\r
reads (with labeling of edges from left to right)\r

The aim of our project is to construct a spectral triple over an algebra of holonomy\r
loops. This algebra is intrinsically noncommutative and the hope is that this non\u0002commutativity will entail additional structure much alike the structures generated\r
by the matrix factor in Connes’ formulation of the standard model.\r
With an algebra of holonomy transforms, which we view as maps\r
γ : ∇ Ñ Holpγ, ∇q P MlpCq ,\r
where l is the size of a matrix representation of G and where ∇ P A, it is clear that\r
a spectral triple involving such an algebra will be a geometrical construction over\r
the space of connection. That is, the space of states on the algebra will be related\r
to the space A. Accordingly, the Dirac type operator in such a triple must have an\r
interpretation in terms of functional derivations.\r
The strategy to obtain such a construction is to exploit the pro-manifold struc\u0002ture of A. That is, since A is densely embedded in A\r
a\r
which is the projective limit\r
of manifolds we aim to construct first geometrical structures over these interme\u0002diate manifolds and subsequently to take their projective and inductive limits over\r
a suitable system of graphs. Thus, the programme involves the following three\r
steps:\r
# 1: construct spectral triples pBΓ, DΓ, HΓq at the level of a finite graphs Γ, with\r
BΓ being the algebra of holonomy loops, now generated by loops restricted\r
to the graph Γ. This step is conceptually easy since AΓ is a compact Lie\u0002group with a Haar measure which gives us a natural Hilbert space and can\u0002didates for a Dirac operator;\r

example, we require\r
PΓΓ1 \u0005 DΓ \u0010 DΓ\r

# 3: take the projective and inductive limit of the triples pBΓ, DΓ, HΓq over all\r
graphs in the inductive system of graphs. Hereby we obtain a candidate for\r
a spectral triple over the full space of connections.\r
This programme was first formulated in [10] where we analyzed the possi\u0002bility to construct a spectral triple based on the projective system of piece-wise\r
analytic graphs used in loop quantum gravity. However, we found this project un\u0002likely to succeed due to the large number of constraints coming from the different\r
projections between embedded graphs. These constraints restrict the Dirac type\r
operator considerably, and for the loop quantum gravity-setup we were unable to\r
solve them.\r
To overcome these difficulties we have, in a recent series of publications [12,\r
13, 14], adopted a new strategy where we instead consider a more restricted sys\u0002tem of graphs. Examples of these restricted systems of graphs are simplicial com\u0002plexes/triangulations and their barycentric subdivisions, and hyper-lattices and\r
their sub-lattices obtained by subdividing each cell symmetrically. These exam\u0002ples all permit a spectral triple construction with interesting properties."""

We now give an outline of the construction of the algebra of holonomy loops and\r

adding these two factors – the Clifford bundle and the matrix factor – in (5) is to\r
accommodate the Dirac operator and the algebra of holonomy loops, respectively.\r

on the level of the graph Γ. The choice of the Dirac operator is, at this point,\r
largely free.\r

Consider now a system of nested simplicial complexes\r

where the arrows indicate compatibility with the structure maps. It turns out that\r
the required compatibility is automatic for the algebra, and is easily obtained for\r

to this compatibility condition. Since the solution described in [13] is considerably\r
more complicated than the solution described in [14] we shall here describe the\r
latter. Consider therefore the following change of variables\r

product. This Hilbert space is manifestly separable.\r
In fact, the Hilbert space H is constructed in the same way as the kinemati\u0002cal Hilbert space in loop quantum gravity. If we ignore the Clifford bundle, then\r
the only difference between H and the kinematical Hilbert space is the choice\r
of graphs, triangulations vs. piece-wise analytic, which corresponds to the sep\u0002arability of H and the non-separability of the kinematical Hilbert space of loop\r
quantum gravity. We shall discuss this issue in section 5.1.\r
Next, the algebra\r
B :\u0010 limΓ ÝÑBΓ\r
contains loops defined on a simplicial complex Γn in tΓnu. Again, the algebra B\r
is separable. Finally, the Dirac-like operator DΓndescends to a densely defined\r

which shows that the action of D is to insert Lie-algebra generators at each vertex\r
in the loop. Already here we notice a resemblance to the bracket (3) which also\r
prescribes insertions of Lie-algebra generators into the holonomy loop.\r
In fact, if we omit the part which involves Clifford multiplication with the\r
elements ek P ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q then the bracket given by (14) and (15) is essentially a\r
quantized version of the Poisson bracket (3). Here the holonomy loops belong to\r
B and the corresponding flux operators, which are now located at the vertices in\r
the graphs tΓiu, corresponds to the left-invariant vector fields used to construct the\r
Dirac type operator D. These left-invariant vector fields should be interpreted as\r
flux operators corresponding to infinitesimal surfaces located at the endpoints of\r
the edges carrying the copies of G on which the vector fields act. This implies\r
16

that the Dirac type operator D can be written as a sum of all the flux operators\r
located at the vertices in the family of graphs tΓiu.\r
This shows that the spectral triple construction captures information tanta\u0002mount to a representation of the Poisson brackets of general relativity. The com\u0002bination of the algebra of holonomy loops and the Dirac type operator involves\r
both conjugate variables. The main difference to the representation used in loop\r
quantum gravity is the choice of graphs. It is important to keep in mind that the\r

tviu is a dense set in M and the space of smooth connections is densely embedded\r

If we interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)\r

A key motivation for constructing the operator D is to find canonical structures\r
at a quantized level. The spectral action construction represents a top-down ap\u0002proach to quantum gravity. This means that the relevant question is not ”how to\r
quantize” certain structures but rather how to obtain a semi-classical analysis once\r
the construction is completed.\r
Thus, a relevant question is whether the spectral triple construction has any\u0002thing to say about the dynamics of quantum gravity? Does it contain information\r
about the Hamiltonian of general relativity? In the following we will attempt to\r
answer this question with an argument as to how a candidate for a Hamilton con\u0002straint might arise from the spectral triple construction.\r
We start with a fluctuation of the Dirac operator. This is generally of the form\r
D˜\r
 \u0010 D  W ,\r
where W \u0010 arD, bs is a noncommutative 1-form and where a and b are elements\r

constraint should be of the form\r
TrpFWΨq \u0010 0 . (18)\r
Here, Tr is with respect to S Up2q. Heuristically, this expression has the right\r
form. To see this we first expand the loop L according to\r
L \u0012 1  α\r
2F  \u0004 \u0004 \u0004 ,\r
where α\r
2\r
is the area expanded by the ”small” loop and F is the field strength\r
tensor of the Ashtekar connection. Furthermore, D is heuristically of the form\r
D \u0010\r
»\r
Σ\r
dxe\r
i\r
j\r
pxq \u0004 Eˆ\r
j\r

pxq ,\r
which can be seen from (13) and from the fact that the sum runs over a dense set\r
in M. Here e\r
i\r
j\r
pxq represents again an element in the Clifford bundle. When we\r
combine these expressions we obtain, to second order in α, the following:\r
TrpD˜\r

pyq will produce a delta function in\r

which has the same structure as (8) and therefore resembles a quantization of the\r
Hamilton constraint.\r
It is important to emphasize that this argument, in its present form, only works\r
at a heuristic level. We expect that much can be added to the argument in the form\r
of additional structure. For instance, when discussing fluctuation of the Dirac op\u0002erator one should also consider a real structure, which, at present, has not been\r
analyzed nor constructed. Furthermore, a rigorous semiclassical analysis is nec\u0002essary to fully estimate the significance of an expression like (18).\r
However, it is clear that once the spectral triple pB, H, Dq is constructed,\r
then an object like expression (17) and the constraint (18) are canonical and free of\r
the ordering ambiguities which one encounters in a standard quantization scheme.\r
Also, these expression require no regularization. This indicates that a spectral\r
triple construction like the one discussed here might indeed help define a canonical\r
theory of quantum gravity.\r

Recall that the Dirac operator D depends on a se\u0002quence taiu of real parameters. To understand and\r
interpret the spectral triple construction it is neces\u0002sary to understand the significance of these parame\u0002ters.\r
First, the role of the parameters taiu is to set a\r
scale. Edges which lie ’deep’ in the inductive system\r
of graphs are assigned large a’s compared to edges\r
which lie ’higher’ (see figure). This means that a ’coarse grained’ loop corre\u0002sponds to small a’s whereas a ’refined’ loop corresponds to large a’s.\r
Therefore, when D probes a loop the eigenvalues corresponding to ’coarse’\r
information about the loop are weighted with smaller a’s compared to eigenvalues\r
which corresponds to more ’refined’ information.\r
It is the requirement of D to have compact resolvent which dictates this addi\u0002tional scaling degree of freedom. At present we have no clear interpretation of this\r
structure, except that this seems important in order to extract topological informa\u0002tion of the underlying manifold. Furthermore, such a scaling degree of freedom is\r
reminiscent of the renormalization group theory of lattice gauge theory.\r
There is in fact a natural choice for the a’s since they correspond to a split of\r
an edge in two. This suggest the sequence\r
an \u0010 2\r
n\r
.\r
However, although this sequence is divergent, it is in fact exactly the sequence\r
where D fails to be spectral. This means that infinities (for example, in the spec\u0002tral action functional) will arise for exactly this choice8\r
. Instead one could try\r
with the permissible sequence\r
an \u0010 p2  \u000Fq\r
n\r
,\r
and subsequently take the limit \u000F Ñ 0. One may speculate whether the infinities\r
which arise in this limit might somehow be related to the infinities one encounters\r
in the renormalization procedure of quantum field theory.\r
8This statement probably depends on the exact choice of Dirac type operator. We know it is\r
valid for the Dirac type operators constructed in [14].\r
