Abstract:\r
Entanglement entropy obeys a ‘first law’, an exact quantum generalization of the ordinary\r
first law of thermodynamics. In any CFT with a semiclassical holographic dual, this first\r
law has an interpretation in the dual gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes\r
dual to CFT states. For small perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that\r
the set of such constraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly equivalent\r
to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational equations of motion,\r
linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement entropy computed by the Ryu\u0002Takayanagi formula S = A/(4GN), we obtain the linearized Einstein equations. For theories\r
in which the vacuum entanglement entropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald\r
functionals, we obtain the linearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories.\r
Using the first law, we also derive the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor, given the\r
holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a simple alternative to\r
holographic renormalization for computing the stress tensor expectation value in arbitrary\r
higher derivative gravitational theories.

1 Introduction\r
According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, spacetime and gravitational physics in AdS\r
emerge from the dynamics of certain strongly-coupled conformal field theories with a large\r
number of degrees of freedom. A central question is to understand why and how this hap\u0002pens. In recent work, it has been suggested that the physics of quantum entanglement plays\r
an essential role, e.g. [1–5]. This was motivated in part by the importance of quantum en\u0002tanglement for understanding quantum phases of matter in condensed matter systems [6].\r
Ryu and Takayanagi have proposed [1, 2] that entanglement entropy, one measure of en\u0002tanglement between subsets of degrees of freedom in general quantum systems, provides a\r
direct window into the emergent spacetime geometry, giving the areas of certain extremal\r
surfaces. This provides a quantitative connection between CFT entanglement and the dual\r
spacetime geometry. Recently, this connection has been utilized to understand the emergence\r
of spacetime dynamics (i.e. gravity) from the CFT physics [7]. Making use of a ‘first law’\r
for entanglement entropy derived in [8], it was shown [7] that in any holographic theory for\r
which the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription computes the entanglement entropy of the boundary\r
CFT, spacetimes dual to small perturbations of the CFT vacuum state must satisfy Einstein’s\r
equations linearized around pure AdS spacetime.\r
In this paper, we provide further insight into the results of [7, 8] and extend them to\r
general holographic CFTs, for which the classical bulk equations may include terms at higher\r
order in the curvatures or derivatives. We show further that the first law for entanglement\r
entropy in the CFT can be understood as the microscopic origin of a particular case of the\r
first law of black hole thermodynamics, applied to AdS-Rindler horizons. We begin with a\r
brief review of some essential background before summarizing our main results.\r
The ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy\r
The crucial piece of CFT physics giving rise to linearized gravitational equations in the dual\r
theory is a ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy,\r
δSA = δhHAi (1.1)\r
equating the first order variation in the entanglement entropy for a spatial region A with\r
the first order variation in the expectation value of HA, the modular (or entanglement)\r
Hamiltonian. The latter operator is defined as the logarithm of the unperturbed state, i.e.\r
ρA ≃ e\r
−HA — see section 2.1 for further details. The first law was derived in [8]\r
1 as a special\r
case of a more general result for finite perturbations\r
∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi (1.2)\r
obtained using the positivity of ‘relative entropy’.2 A more direct demonstration of (1.1) is\r
reviewed in section 2.1 below.\r
1Related observations had been made independently using various holographic calculations, e.g. [9].\r
2Relative entropy can be viewed as a statistical measure of the distance between two states (i.e. density\r
matrices) in the same Hilbert space — e.g. see [10, 11] for reviews.\r

In general, the modular Hamiltonian HA is a complicated object that cannot be expressed\r
as an integral of local operators. However, starting from the vacuum state of a CFT in flat\r
space and taking A to be a ball-shaped spatial region of radius R centered at x0, denoted\r
B(R, x0), the modular Hamiltonian is given by a simple integral [12]\r

respectively.\r
The holographic interpretation\r
For conformal field theories with a gravity dual, the first law for ball-shaped regions can be\r
translated into a geometrical constraint obeyed by any spacetime dual to a small perturbation\r
of the CFT vacuum. To understand this, we first recall the holographic interpretation of\r
entanglement entropy and energy density in the general case (see section 2.3 for more details).\r
As shown by [12] in deriving (1.3), the vacuum entanglement entropy of a CFT for a\r
ball-shaped region in flat space can be reinterpreted as the thermal entropy of the CFT on\r
a hyperbolic cylinder at temperature set by the hyperbolic space curvature scale, by relating\r
the two backgrounds with a conformal mapping. For a holographic CFT, the latter thermal\r
entropy may then be calculated as the horizon entropy of the “black hole” dual to this thermal\r
state on hyperbolic space. In this case, the black hole is simply a Rindler wedge (which we\r
call the AdS-Rindler patch) of the original pure AdS space, as shown in figure 2. If the\r
gravitational theory in the bulk is Einstein gravity, then the horizon entropy is given by\r
the usual Bekenstein-Hawking formula, SBH = A/(4GN), and this construction [12] provides a\r
derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription [1] for a spherical entangling surface.3 However,\r
we note that the same analysis applies for any classical and covariant gravity theory in the\r
bulk, in which case the horizon entropy is given by Wald’s formula [14–16]\r

where L denotes the gravitational Lagrangian and nab is the binormal to the horizon H.\r
To summarize, in general holographic theories, entanglement entropy in the vacuum state\r
for a ball-shaped region B is computed by the Wald functional applied to the horizon of the\r

arbitrary entangling surfaces in time-independent (and some special time-dependent) backgrounds [13].\r

AdS-Rindler patch associated with B. We will argue in section 2.3 that this should remain\r
true for perturbations to the vacuum state, so the left side of (1.4) computes the change in\r
entropy of the AdS-Rindler horizon under a small variation of the CFT state. Meanwhile, the\r
expectation value of the stress tensor is related to the asymptotic behaviour of the metric,\r
so the right side of (1.4) may be expressed as an integral involving the asymptotic metric\r
over a ball-shaped region of the boundary. In section 2.3, we show that this integral may\r
be interpreted as the variation in energy of the AdS-Rindler spacetime. Thus, the gravity\r
version of the entanglement first law (1.4) may be interpreted as a first law for AdS-Rindler\r
spacetimes. At a technical level, this represents a non-local constraint on the spacetime fields,\r
equating an integral involving the asymptotic metric perturbation over a boundary surface\r
to an integral involving the bulk metric perturbation (and possibly matter fields) over a bulk\r
surface.\r
Main results\r
Our first main result, presented in section 3, is that this first law for AdS-Rindler spacetimes,\r
i.e. the gravitational version of (1.4), is a special case of a first law proved by Iyer and\r
Wald for stationary spacetimes with bifurcate Killing horizons (i.e. at finite temperature) in\r
general classical theories of gravity. According to Iyer and Wald, for any perturbation of a\r
stationary background that satisfies the linearized equations of motion following from some\r
Lagrangian, the first law holds provided we define horizon entropy using the Wald functional\r
(1.5) associated with this Lagrangian. Thus, the CFT result (1.4) can be seen as an exact\r
quantum version of the Iyer-Wald first law, at least for the case of AdS-Rindler horizons.\r
Our second result, presented in sections 4 and 5, provides a converse to the theorem\r
of Iyer and Wald. In AdS space, we can associate an AdS-Rindler patch to any ball-shaped\r
spatial region on the boundary in any Lorentz frame, as in figure 2. An arbitrary perturbation\r
to the AdS metric can be understood as a perturbation to each of these Rindler patches. We\r
show that if the first law is satisfied for every AdS-Rindler patch, then the perturbation must\r
satisfy the linearized gravitational equations. Thus, the set of non-local constraints (one for\r
each ball-shaped region in each Lorentz frame) implied by (1.4) is equivalent to the set of\r
local gravitational equations.\r
The result in the previous paragraph – that the first law for AdS-Rindler patches implies\r
the linearized gravitational equations – is completely independent of AdS/CFT and holds for\r
any classical theory of gravity in AdS. However, since for holographic CFTs this gravitational\r
first law is implied by the entanglement first law, we conclude that the linearized gravita\u0002tional equations for the dual spacetime can be derived from any holographic CFT, given the\r
entanglement functional. This extends the results of [7] to general holographic CFTs.\r
As a further application of the entanglement first law, we point out (see section 4.1)\r
that eq. (1.1), applied to infinitesimal balls, can be used to deduce the ‘holographic stress\r
tensor,’ i.e. the gravitational quantity that computes the expectation value of the CFT\r
stress tensor, given the holographic prescription for computing entanglement entropy. This\r
provides a simple alternative approach to the usual holographic renormalization procedure,\r
– 4 –

as we illustrate with examples in section 6. Finally, we show that eq. (1.1) also provides\r
information about the operators in the boundary theory corresponding to additional degrees\r
of freedom that can be associated with the metric in the context of higher derivative gravity.\r
We conclude in section 7 with a brief discussion of our results. In particular, we discuss\r
the relation of our work to the work of Jacobson [17], who obtained gravitational equations\r
by considering a gravitational first law applied to local Rindler horizons.\r
2 Background\r
In this section, we review some basic facts about entanglement entropy, modular Hamiltonians\r
and their holographic interpretation. In section 2.1, following [8], we review the first law-like\r
relation δSA = δhHAi satisfied by entanglement entropy, specializing to entanglement for\r
ball-shaped regions in a conformal field theory in section 2.2. In section 2.3, we review the\r
bulk interpretation of SA and hHAi in a holographic CFT.\r
2.1 The first law of entanglement entropy\r
For any state in a general quantum system, the state of a subsystem A is described by\r
a reduced density matrix ρA = trA¯ ρtotal, where ρtotal is the density matrix describing the\r
global state of the full system and A¯ is the complement of A. The entanglement of this\r
subsystem with the rest of the system may be quantified by the entanglement entropy SA,\r
defined as the von Neumann entropy\r
SA = − tr ρA log ρA (2.1)\r
of the density matrix ρA.\r
Since the reduced density matrix ρA is both hermitian and positive (semi)definite, it can\r
be expressed as\r
ρA =\r
e\r
−HA\r
tr(e−HA )\r
, (2.2)\r
where the Hermitian operator HA is known as the modular Hamiltonian. The denominator\r
is included on the right in the expression above to ensure that the reduced density matrix\r
has unit trace. Note the eq. (2.2) only defines HA up to an additive constant.\r
Now, consider any infinitesimal variation to the state of the system. The first order\r
variation4 of the entanglement entropy (2.1) is given by\r
δSA = − tr(δρA log ρA) − trρA ρ\r
−1\r
A\r
δρA\r
\u0001\r
= tr(δρA HA) − tr(δρA) . (2.3)\r
Since the the trace of the reduced density matrix equals one by definition, we must have\r
tr(δρA) = 0. Hence, the variation of the entanglement entropy obeys\r
δSA = δhHAi , (2.4)\r
4Here and below, the variations are defined by considering a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i such\r
that |Ψ(0)i = |0i. The variation δO of any quantity associated with |Ψi is then defined by δO = ∂λO(λ)|λ=0.\r

space, showing the evolution generated by HB. A conformal transformation maps D to a hyperbolic\r
cylinder Hd−1× time (right), taking HB to the ordinary Hamiltonian for the CFT on Hd−1.\r
where HA is the modular Hamiltonian associated with the original unperturbed state.\r
In cases where we start with a thermal state ρA = e\r
−βH/ tr(e−βH), equation (2.4) gives\r
δhHi = T δSA, an exact quantum version of the first law of thermodynamics. Thus, (2.4)\r
represents a generalization of the first law of thermodynamics valid for arbitrary perturbations\r
to arbitrary (non-equilibrium) states.\r
2.2 The first law in conformal field theories\r
We now specialize to the case of local quantum field theories. Here, for any fixed Cauchy\r
surface, the field configurations on this time slice are representative of the Hilbert space of\r
the underlying quantum theory. We can then define a subsystem A by introducing a smooth\r
boundary or ‘entangling surface’, which divides the Cauchy surface into two separate regions,\r
A and A¯; the local fields in the region A define a subsystem.\r
In general, the relation (2.4) is of limited use. For a general quantum field theory, a\r
general state, and a general region A, the modular Hamiltonian is not known and there is\r
no known practical method to compute it. Typically, HA is expected to be a complicated\r
non-local operator. However, there are a few situations where the modular Hamiltonian has\r
been established to have a simple form as the integral of a local operator, and in which it\r
generates a simple geometric flow.\r
One example is when we consider a conformal field theory in its vacuum state, ρtotal =\r
|0ih0| in d-dimensional Minkowski space, and choose the region A to be a ball B(R, x0) of\r
radius R on a time slice t = t0 and centered at x\r
i = xi\r
0\r
.\r

) where i = 1 . . . d − 1, while\r

Ttt(t0, ~x) , (2.5)\r
where Tµν is the stress tensor.\r
To understand the origin of this expression, we recall that the causal development6 D of\r
B is related by a conformal transformation to a hyperbolic cylinder H = Hd−1 × Rτ (time)\r
as shown in figure 1. As argued in [12], this transformation induces a map of CFT states that\r
takes the vacuum density matrix on B to the thermal density matrix ρH ∼ exp(−2πRHτ ) for\r
the CFT on hyperbolic space, where R is the curvature radius of the hyperbolic space and\r
Hτ is the CFT Hamiltonian generating time translations in H. The modular Hamiltonian for\r
ρH is then just 2πRHτ . Going back to D, it follows that the modular Hamiltonian for the\r
density matrix ρB is the Hamiltonian which generates the image under the inverse conformal\r
transformation of these time translations back in D, shown on the left in figure 1.\r
To obtain the explicit expression (2.5), we define ζB to be the image of the Killing vector\r
2πR ∂τ under the inverse conformal transformation. This is a conformal Killing vector on the\r
original Minkowski space which can be written as a combination of a time translation Pt and\r
a certain special conformal transformation Kt,\r

)∂i. (2.7)\r
It is straightforward to check that ζB generates a flow which remains entirely in D, acting as\r
a null flow on ∂D and vanishing on the sphere ∂B(R, x0) and at the future and past tips of\r
D. The generator of this flow in the underlying CFT may be written covariantly as\r

where dΣ\r

is the volume-form on the (d − 1)-dimensional surface S. The integral may be\r
evaluated on any spatial surface S within the causal diamond D whose boundary is ∂B, but\r
for the particular choice S = B(R, x0), we recover (2.5). Note that the normalization of the\r
conformal Killing vector ζB was chosen in (2.6) to ensure that modular Hamiltonian HB and\r
the Hamiltonian on the hyperbolic cylinder Hτ are related by HB = 2πR U0 Hτ U\r
−1\r
0 where\r
U0 is the unitary transformation which implements the conformal mapping between the two\r
backgrounds [12].\r
In summary, starting from the vacuum state of any conformal field theory and considering\r
a ball-shaped region B, the first law (2.4) simplifies to\r
δSB = δEB, (2.9)\r

2.3 Interpretation of the first law in holographic CFTs\r
The first law (2.4) reviewed in the previous section is a general result. Hence for ball-shaped\r
regions in an arbitrary CFT in any number of spacetime dimensions, δSB = δEB with EB\r
defined in eq. (2.10). We will be interested in understanding this relation for holographic\r
CFT’s with a classical bulk dual, i.e. theories for which at least a subset of the states have\r
a dual interpretation as smooth, asymptotically AdS field configurations. In this case, the\r
vacuum state of the boundary CFT corresponds to pure anti-de Sitter space, while certain\r
small perturbations around the vacuum state should correspond to spacetime geometries that\r
are small perturbations around empty AdS.7In holographic theories, both SB and EB should\r
match with observables on the gravity side, so δSB = δEB will translate into a constraint\r
δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
that must be satisfied for any spacetime dual to a small perturbation of the\r
vacuum AdS spacetime.\r
2.3.1 Holographic interpretation of the entanglement entropy\r
The holographic prescription for computing the entanglement entropy is not known in general,\r
but in the known cases (e.g., [1, 13, 20–22]), it is given by extremizing a certain functional\r
of the bulk metric over codimension-two bulk surfaces whose boundary coincides with ∂A in\r
the boundary CFT. However, here we are only interested in the holographic entanglement\r
entropy for a ball-shaped region B in the CFT when the total state is the vacuum or a small\r
perturbation thereof. This particular case is well-understood due to the observation of [12],\r
reviewed in the previous section, that the vacuum density matrix for B maps by a conformal\r
transformation to a thermal state of the CFT on hyperbolic space.\r
Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, the thermal state of the CFT on hyperbolic space\r
at temperature T =\r
1\r
2πR is dual to a hyperbolic ‘black hole’ spacetime at this temperature,\r
i.e., AdS-Rindler space, with metric\r

) . (2.11)\r
The entanglement entropy for the region B equals the thermal entropy of the hyperbolic\r
space CFT, which can be interpreted as the entropy of this ‘black hole.’ In an arbitrary\r
theory of gravity, black hole entropy is computed by evaluating the Wald functional (1.5) on\r
the horizon. In terms of the Poincar´e coordinates on AdS space\r

7More precisely, the states that we will consider have energy of order ε cT , where cT is the central charge of\r
the boundary CFT (e.g. see [19]) which provides a measure of the number of degrees of freedom in the CFT.\r
Since we consider classical gravity in the bulk, cT → ∞; we take ε << 1 in order for the perturbation to be\r
classical, but small. The first law relation also holds for quantum states in the bulk, whose CFT energy does\r
not scale with cT , but we will not consider them in this article.\r

blue paths indicate the boundary flow associated with HB and the conformal Killing vector ζ. Dashed\r
red paths indicate the action of the Killing vector ξ.\r
the hyperbolic ‘black hole’ associated with the ball B(R, x0) is simply the wedge shown in\r
figure 2, the intersection of the causal past and the casual future of the region D on the\r
boundary. The coordinate transformation between the two metrics is described in [12]. The\r
horizon slice approached with ρ → ℓ and τ fixed in the black hole metric (2.11) corresponds\r
to the hemisphere B˜ = {t = t0, (x\r
i − xi\r
0\r
)\r
2 + z2 = R2} in Poincar´e coordinates. By design\r
[12], this is also the extremal surface in AdS bulk with boundary ∂B. Thus, the entanglement\r
entropy SB for the vacuum state can be calculated gravitationally by evaluating the Wald\r
functional (1.5) on the surface B˜.\r
If we consider a perturbation of the original vacuum state, the perturbation of the en\u0002tanglement entropy must equal the perturbation of the thermal entropy of the CFT on the\r
hyperbolic cylinder. Assuming that this equals the perturbation to the black hole entropy,\r
we must also have that δSgrav\r
B = δSW ald\r
B\r
. In general, the entanglement entropy functional is\r
known to differ from the Wald functional [21, 23] by terms quadratic in the extrinsic curvature\r
of the extremal bulk surface. These terms are important for arbitrarily-shaped entangling\r
surfaces or general states in the CFT. However, for the special case of a spherical entangling\r
surface considered here and a CFT in the vacuum, the extremal surface B˜ in the bulk is the\r
bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon defining the boundary of the AdS-Rindler patch\r
– 9 –

and the extrinsic curvatures of this surface vanish. Therefore, δSgrav\r
B\r
and δSW ald\r
B\r
are equal\r
at linear order in the perturbations we are considering.8\r
To summarize, the holographic dictionary implies that S\r
grav\r
B\r
for a small perturbation\r
around AdS is the Wald functional of the perturbed metric evaluated on B˜.\r
2.3.2 Holographic interpretation of the modular energy EB\r
In the CFT, the expression (2.10) defines EB in terms of the expectation value of the field\r
theory stress energy tensor. On the gravity side, the latter is computed by the “holographic\r
stress tensor” T\r
grav\r
µν , a quantity constructed locally from the asymptotic metric.\r
9 For a general\r
theory, T\r
grav\r
µν can be obtained via a systematic procedure known as holographic renormal\u0002ization [24–26]. Alternatively, as we show in sections 4.1 and 6 below, T\r
grav\r
µν can be derived\r
using the holographic entanglement entropy function and the relation δSB = δEB.\r
The gravitational version of EB is simply obtained by replacing the stress tensor expec\u0002tation value in (2.8) or (2.10) with the holographic stress tensor\r

perturbations we are considering). Thus, for perturbations to the vacuum state, E\r
grav\r
B\r
can\r
be interpreted as the perturbation to the energy of the AdS-Rindler patch associated with\r
the region B, as in figure 2.\r
Note that under the conformal map from D to H, the conserved charge associated to ζB\r
maps to (2πR times) the energy associated to τ translations, computed using either formalism.\r
2.3.3 Summary\r
In summary, for states of a holographic CFT with a classical gravity dual description, the\r
CFT relation δSB = δEB translates to a statement that the integral of the Wald functional\r
over the bulk surface B˜ must equal the integral of the energy functional, as given in (2.13),\r
8Further, note that in the perturbed spacetime, the extremal surface will not necessarily correspond to\r
the bifurcation surface of the AdS-Rindler horizon. However, since B˜ is an extremal surface for the Wald\r
functional, changes in the Wald functional due to variations in the surface come in only at second order in\r
the metric perturbation. To calculate the Wald functional at leading order in the metric perturbation, we\r
therefore need only evaluate δSW ald\r
B on B˜, the bifurcation surface of the unperturbed AdS-Rindler horizon.\r
9Other fields in the bulk may also contribute to the holographic stress tensor (e.g. a bilinear of gauge\r
fields when d = 2), but their contributions are always nonlinear in the fields and vanish at the linearized order\r
around pure AdS that we are considering.\r
– 10 –

over the boundary surface B. This provides one nonlocal constraint on the metric for each\r
ball B in each Lorentz frame. The constraints may be interpreted as the statement that the\r
perturbation to the entropy of the AdS-Rindler patch associated with the region B equals\r
the perturbation to the energy.\r
3 The holographic first law of entanglement from the first law of black hole\r
thermodynamics\r
In holographic CFTs, whenever the gravitational observables corresponding to SB and EB\r
are known, the first law of entanglement entropy (2.4) applied to a ball, i.e. δSB = δEB,\r
gives a prediction for the equivalence of two corresponding gravitational quantities, δSgrav\r
B\r
and δEgrav\r
B\r
, in any spacetime dual to a small perturbation of the CFT vacuum state. This\r
prediction must hold assuming the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of our holo\u0002graphic interpretation of EB and SB. As we will see in the next section, the power of this\r
equivalence arises because in fact, we have an infinite number of predictions since δSB = δEB\r
can be applied for any ball-shaped region in any Lorentz frame in the boundary geometry. For\r
the case of Einstein gravity, where entanglement entropy is calculated by the Ryu-Takayanagi\r
proposal [1, 2], the equivalence of δSgrav\r
B\r
and δEgrav\r
B was confirmed in [8], and by a different\r
method in [7].\r
In this section, we will verify that δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
follows from the equations of motion\r
in a general theory of gravity. The crucial observation, described in the previous section, is\r
that this gravitational relation can be interpreted as a statement of the equivalence of energy\r
and entropy for perturbations of AdS-Rindler space. This equivalence follows directly from\r
the generalized first law of black hole thermodynamics proved by Iyer and Wald [27].\r
The Iyer-Wald theorem states that for a stationary spacetime with a bifurcate Killing\r
horizon generated by a Killing vector ξ, arbitrary on-shell perturbations satisfy κ\r
2π\r
δSWald =\r
δE[ξ]. Here SWald is the Wald entropy defined in the introduction, E[ξ] is a canonical energy\r
associated to the Killing vector ξ and κ is the surface gravity: ξ\r
a∇aξb = κ ξb on the horizon.\r
The key observation that connects this to our holographic version of the entanglement\r
first law is that the Iyer-Wald theorem applies to AdS-Rindler horizons. It is straightforward\r
to check that the vector\r
ξB = −\r
2π\r
R\r
(t − t0)[z∂z + (x\r
i − xi\r
0\r
)∂i] + π\r
R\r
[R\r
2 − z2 − (t − t0)2 − (~x − ~x0)2\r
] ∂t (3.1)\r
is an exact Killing vector of the standard Poincar´e metric (2.12), which vanishes on B˜(R, ~x0).\r
This vector is in fact proportional to ∂τ in the AdS-Rindler coordinates (2.11). Thus, the\r
hemisphere B˜ is the bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon for ξB and the region Σ(R, ~x0)\r
enclosed by B˜ and B is a spacelike slice that plays the role of the black hole exterior. The\r
Iyer-Wald theorem applies, and the Killing vector has been normalized such that κ = 2π, so\r
δSW ald\r
B = δEB[ξB].\r
The definition of modular energy entering the above equality is the Iyer-Wald one; we\r
show in section 5.3 that this quantity agrees with δEgrav\r
B\r
defined in terms of the holographic\r
– 11 –

stress tensor. Finally, we argued in the previous section that δSgrav\r
B = δSW ald\r
B\r
, and therefore\r
it follows that δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
. This generalizes the result of [8] to an arbitrary higher\u0002derivative theory of gravity.\r
4 Linearized gravity from the holographic first law\r
In the previous section, making use of the theorem of Iyer and Wald [27], we argued that in\r
a general theory of gravity, any perturbation to AdS satisfying the linearized gravitational\r
equations will obey the holographic version of the entanglement first law, i.e. δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
.\r
In this section, we will demonstrate a converse statement: any asymptotically AdS spacetime\r
for which δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
for all balls B in all Lorentz frames must satisfy the linearized\r
gravitational equations and have the appropriate boundary conditions at the asymptotic\r
boundary.\r
We begin in section 4.1 by showing that δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
applied to infinitesimal ball\u0002shaped regions allows us to determine the holographic stress tensor in a general theory of\r
gravity and to constrain the asymptotic behavior of the metric. In section 4.3, we explain\r
how δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
, when applied to balls of arbitrary radius and centered at arbitrary\r
locations in arbitrary Lorentz frames, can be used to deduce the linearized gravitational\r
equations of motion, generalizing the results of [7]. Since we have already argued in section 3\r
that these equations of motion imply δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
, it follows that the holographic version\r
of the entanglement first law is equivalent to the linearized gravitational equations in general\r
theories of gravity.\r
In situations where the metric perturbation is the only field turned on in the bulk, the\r
asymptotic behavior of the metric together with the linearized equations of motion determine\r
the metric perturbation everywhere. In this case, knowledge of the entanglement functional\r
allows us to recover the complete mapping from states to dual spacetimes at the linearized\r
level.\r
4.1 The holographic stress tensor from the holographic entanglement functional\r
To begin, we show that given the holographic prescription for computing entanglement en\u0002tropy, the equation δSB = δEB applied to ball-shaped regions of vanishing size can be used\r
to determine the relation between the expectation value of the field theory stress tensor and\r
the asymptotic metric in the dual spacetime.\r

In the limit of a very small spherical region, i.e. R → 0, the expectation value of the stress\r
tensor is approximately constant throughout the ball B(R, x0). Thus, the leading contribution\r
to δEB is obtained by replacing δhTtt(t0, ~x)i with its central value δhTtt(t0, ~x0)i ≡ δhTtt(x0)i,\r

surface. The above equation tells us that SB[h]/Rdcannot be arbitrary, but rather it must\r
have a finite limit as R → 0.\r

at x0 on a spatial slice in the frame of reference of an observer moving with the d-velocity\r

. From the result (4.4), it is clear that given the bulk prescription for calculating δSB, this\r
formula provides us the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor.\r

µ = 0 , ∂µh\r
(d)µν = 0 . (4.12)\r
These equations correspond to the initial value constraints on the z = 0 surface in Einstein\r

Of course, this expression is the usual result for the linearized holographic stress tensor in\r
Einstein gravity in AdSd+1 [24, 25].\r
In section 5.3 we show, using a scaling argument, that even in the presence of higher\r
derivative terms, the CFT stress tensor Tµν ∝ h\r
(d)\r
µν , but with a non-trivial coefficient that\r
depends on the higher curvature couplings10 — see also section 6.\r
4.2 The linearized Fefferman-Graham expansion\r
We have just shown how the R → 0 limit of the first law relation constrains the leading\r
behavior of the metric for small z and determines the holographic stress tensor. By equating\r
terms at higher orders in the expansion of δSgrav\r
B(R,x0) = δEgrav\r
B(R,x0)\r
in powers of R, we can\r
obtain additional constraints on the metric. At each higher order in R, the equations involve\r
successively higher terms in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the metric (i.e. the expansion\r
in powers of z). In [7], it was shown, for theories with holographic entanglement entropy\r
computed by area, that these constraints completely determine the linearized metric to all\r
orders in the Fefferman-Graham expansion. At the linearized level, this gives the complete\r
10This result can understood using conformal invariance, since h\r
(d)\r
µν is the only spin-2 tensor that we can\r
write down with scaling dimension d under z → λz. Here we are assuming that there are no scalar fields,\r
coupled linearly to curvature, with mass tuned so that the conformal dimension of the dual operators is ∆ = d,\r
and similarly for other matter fields.\r

Σ is the enclosed d-dimensional spatial region.\r
metric perturbation everywhere in the bulk, and the result is precisely the solution to the\r
linearized Einstein’s equations with boundary behavior governed by the holographic stress\r
tensor.\r
While we could apply the same approach to more general theories of gravity, we will\r
instead take another route that leads to the full equations of motion without having to\r
assume a series expansion for the quantities in the first law relation.\r
4.3 Linearized equations from the holographic entanglement functional\r
In this section, we will show that knowledge of the holographic entanglement functional allows\r
us to deduce the linearized gravitational equations for the entire dual spacetime, by making\r
use of the relation δSB = δEB for ball shaped regions B(R, x0) of arbitrary radius R and\r
center position x\r
µ\r
0\r
in arbitrary Lorentz frames.\r
Figure 3 shows the unperturbed bulk AdS spacetime, with the region B(R, x0) on the\r
boundary, together with the bulk extremal surface B˜(R, x0) with the same boundary as B\r
and the spatial region Σ on a constant time slice bounded by these two surfaces. Using\r
the definition (2.13) and the result (4.4) for the holographic stress tensor, we can write the\r
quantity δEgrav\r
B\r
as an integral over the corresponding region B(R, x0) on the boundary of the\r
dual spacetime of some local quantity, a (d−1)-form, that is constructed from the asymptotic\r
limit of the metric perturbation hab.\r
In a similar way, the holographic entanglement functional gives us a prescription for\r
writing the entanglement entropy δSB as an integral over the extremal surface B˜(R, x0) in\r
the bulk (shown in figure 2). Again, the form that we integrate is locally constructed from\r
the metric perturbation hab (and possibly matter fields). The relation δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
then\r
places a constraint on the perturbation: the two integrals corresponding to δEgrav\r
B\r
and δSgrav\r
B\r

must be equal. This must be true for any R and x\r
µ\r
0\r
, in any Lorentz frame. We will show that\r
this infinite set of nonlocal integral equations together implies the local differential equations\r
δEg\r
ab = 0, where δEgab are the linearized gravitational equations of motion.\r
Turning the nonlocal constraint into a local equation\r
To convert the nonlocal integral equations into a local equation, the strategy is to make use\r
of the machinery used by Iyer and Wald to derive the first law from the equations of motion.\r
The Iyer-Wald formalism is reviewed in detail in the next section, but for now we just need\r
one fact: the crucial step in the derivation is the construction of a (d−1)-form χ that satisfies\r
Z\r
B\r
χ = δEgrav\r
B\r
Z\r
B˜\r
χ = δSgrav\r
B\r
(4.14)\r
and for which dχ = 0 on shell (i.e. when the gravitational equations of motion are satisfied).\r
The first law follows immediately by writing R\r
Σ\r
dχ = 0 and applying Stokes theorem (i.e.\r
integrating by parts).\r
To derive local equations from the gravitational first law, we will show that there exists\r
a form χ which satisfies the relations (4.14) off shell, and whose derivative is\r
dχ = −2ξ\r
a\r
B δEg\r
ab ε\r
b\r
(4.15)\r
where the d-form ε\r
b\r
is the natural volume form on co-dimension one surfaces in the bulk\r
(defined in eq. (5.3)), ξB is the Killing vector (3.1) that vanishes on B˜(R, x0), and δEg\r
ab are\r
the linearized gravitational equations of motion. In addition, we will require that\r
dχ|∂M = 0 (4.16)\r
where ∂M is the AdS boundary, assuming the tracelessness and conservation of the holo\u0002graphic stress tensor.11 This ensures that the energy E\r
grav\r
B\r
does not depend on the surface\r
S on the boundary that we use to evaluate it, as long as ∂S = ∂B. Note that on Σ, only the\r
time components of ξ\r
a\r
B\r
and ε\r
b are non-vanishing, so only the tt component of the gravitational\r
equations appears on the right-hand side of eq. (4.15).\r
The derivation of these statements in a general theory of gravity relies on the Iyer-Wald\r
formalism [27] and is deferred to section 5. Now we will show that the existence of the form\r
χ with these properties implies the equations of motion. The relation δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r

for any Σ(R, ~x0). As we show in appendix A, this implies that the integrand vanishes every\u0002where, i.e. δEg\r
tt = 0, as we wished to show.\r
So far we have used the first law for every ball B(R, ~x0) in a spatial slice at fixed t. More\r

in a frame of reference defined by a d-velocity vector u\r

implies u\r
µuν\r
δEg\r
µν = 0, where the index µ = 0, . . . , d − 1 runs over the boundary coordinates.\r
Since this holds for any u\r
µ\r
, we have\r
δEg\r
µν = 0 . (4.20)\r
These are all the components of the gravitational equations of motion along the boundary\r
directions.\r
To obtain the remaining equations δEg\r
zµ = 0 and δEgzz = 0, we appeal to the initial\r
value formulation of gravity, in a radial slicing where these are the constraint equations. This\r
formulation guarantees that if these constraints are satisfied at z = 0, and the other equations\r
(4.20) hold everywhere, then the constraints hold for all z.\r
12 The vanishing of the constraints\r
at z = 0 follows from eq. (4.16) combined with eq. (4.15), or ultimately from the conservation\r
and tracelessness of the holographic stress tensor.\r
In detail, we have using the Noether identity (discussed in appendix B) linearized about\r
the AdS background,\r
∇a(δEg)\r
ab = 0 . (4.21)\r

In summary, we can obtain the full set of linearized gravitational equations, if we can\r
show that a form χ exists, which satisfies eqs. (4.14), (4.15) and (4.16). We do this in section\r
5.\r
12In Einstein gravity, this follows from the Bianchi identity by a standard argument [28].\r

5 Linearized equations in general theories of gravity\r
In this section, we review the formalism used by Iyer and Wald to prove a version of the first\r
law of black hole thermodynamics in general theories of gravity (section 5.1), and apply it in\r
section 5.2 to construct a form χ with the properties outlined in section 4.3. We also argue\r
in section 5.3 that the energy for a perturbed AdS-Rindler spacetime as defined by Iyer and\r
Wald is equivalent to the energy defined using the holographic stress tensor in eq. (2.10).\r
5.1 The covariant formalism for entropy and conserved charges\r
We begin by introducing notation and setting up the Iyer-Wald formalism [14, 16]. A helpful\r
general discussion motivating this formalism can be found in [29].\r
Basic definitions\r
Let L be any gravitational Lagrangian, viewed as a d + 1-form\r
L = Lε , (5.1)\r
where L is constructed from the metric, curvature tensors, and their covariant derivatives.\r
Here, ε is the volume form15\r
ε =\r
1\r
(d + 1)! εa1···ad+1 dxa1 ∧ · · · ∧ dxad+1\r
. (5.2)\r
For later convenience, we also define:\r
εa =\r

d!\r
εab2···bd+1dxb2 ∧ · · · ∧ dxbd+1, εab =\r
1\r
(d − 1)! εabc3···cd+1dxc3 ∧ · · · ∧ dxcd+1\r
. (5.3)\r
Denoting the dynamical fields collectively by φ = {gµν , . . . }, the variation of L under a general\r
variation of the fields takes the form\r
δL = E\r
φ\r
δφ + dΘ(δφ) (5.4)\r
where Eφ = 0 are the equations of motion for the theory, and Θ is called the symplectic\r
potential current.16 In the first term, a sum over fields φ with indices contracted appropriately\r
is implied.\r
Definition of Wald entropy from the Noether current\r
For a spacetime with a bifurcate Killing horizon associated to a Killing vector ξ, the Wald\r
entropy can be defined in terms of the Noether current associated with ξ, as we now review.\r
15Note that εa1···ad+1 is an antisymmetric tensor, and our sign convention is εzti1···id−1 = +√\r
−g .\r
16This potential Θ, and similarly the Noether charge form Q below, have ambiguities related to boundary\r
terms in the Lagrangian and shifting by an exact form. Implicitly, these ambiguities, discussed in [15, 16],\r
have been fixed to simplify our formulae here but would not affect our arguments.\r
– 19 –

Starting with an arbitrary vector field ξ, the variation of the Lagrangian under a diffeo\u0002morphism generated by ξ\r
µ\r
is\r
δξL = d(ξ · L) (5.5)\r
where the dot denotes the usual inner product of ξ\r
µ with the form L.\r
17 Since this represents\r
a local symmetry of a Lagrangian field theory, Noether’s theorem guarantees that we can\r
associate to it a current J\r
µ\r
[ξ] that is conserved when the equations of motion are satisfied.\r
This Noether current (expressed as a d-form) is given by\r
J[ξ] = Θ(δξφ) − ξ · L . (5.6)\r
Using eqs. (5.5) and (5.4), we can check that\r
dJ[ξ] = −E\r
φ\r
δξφ , (5.7)\r
so J is conserved on shell as promised.\r
Because eq. (5.7) holds for all vector fields ξ, it follows [30] that we can find a (d−1)-form\r
Q such that\r
J[ξ] = dQ[ξ] (on shell) . (5.8)\r
Recalling that the Noether charge associated with the diffeomorphism ξ is the integral of J\r
over a spacelike hypersurface Σ, we see that the existence of Q (called the Noether charge\r
form) allows us to express this charge as an integral over the boundary of Σ.\r
As shown in [16], Q can be written as\r
Q[ξ] = Wc ξ\r
c + Xcd∇[cξd]\r
, Xcd = −E\r
abcd\r
R εab , (5.9)\r
where Eabcd\r
R\r
is the ‘equation of motion’ for the Riemann tensor, derived as if it were an\r

In a spacetime with a bifurcate Killing horizon, the Wald entropy (1.5) is now defined as\r
SWald = 2π\r
Z\r
H\r
Xcdncd , (5.13)\r
where H is the bifurcation surface and ncd is the binormal to H. This definition also applies\r
to linearized excitations of a stationary background. It is related to the Noether charge as\r
follows. Let ξ be the Killing vector that generates the horizon and vanishes on H. In general,\r
∇[cξd] = κ ncd on the horizon, where κ is the surface gravity. If we normalize ξ so that κ = 2π,\r
then the Wald entropy equals the Noether charge\r
SWald =\r
Z\r
H\r
Q[ξ] . (5.14)\r
On the stationary background, this agrees with (5.13) because ξ = 0 on the bifurcation surface.\r
It was argued in [14, 16] that eqs. (5.14) and (5.13) also agree for linearized excitations.\r
Definition of energy\r
For perturbations of the background spacetime, we can define an energy canonically associated\r
to a Killing vector ξ. Defining the symplectic current\r
ω(δ1φ, δ2φ) = δ2Θ(δ1φ) − δ1Θ(δ2φ) , (5.15)\r
the Hamiltonian that generates translations along ξ\r
µ\r
is obtained by integrating ω over a\r
Cauchy surface C,\r
δHW [ξ] = Z\r
C\r
ω(δφ, δξφ) . (5.16)\r
This can be rewritten using\r
δJ[ξ] = δΘ(δξφ) − ξ · dΘ(δφ) (5.17)\r
= ω(δξφ, δφ) + d(ξ · Θ(δφ)) (5.18)\r
where we used the background equations of motion Eφ = 0 and the formula for the Lie\r
derivative of a form,\r
δξu ≡ Lξu = ξ · du + d(ξ · u). (5.19)\r
Therefore using eqs. (5.11) and (5.18), we have\r
δHW [ξ] = δ\r
Z\r
C\r
ξ\r
aCa +\r
Z\r
∂C\r
(δQ[ξ] − ξ · Θ(δφ)) . (5.20)\r
Thus, H reduces to a boundary term when the equations of motion are satisfied. We define\r
the energy δE[ξ] for an arbitrary (i.e. not necessarily on-shell) perturbation of the background\r
spacetime as this contribution at the asymptotic boundary,18\r
δE[ξ] = Z\r
∂C\r
(δQ[ξ] − ξ · Θ(δφ)) . (5.21)\r
18As discussed in [16], this definition can be extended to general spacetimes with the same asymptotic\r
behavior provided that there exists a form B such that δ\r
R\r
∂C\r
ξ · B =\r
R\r
∂C\r
ξ · Θ. In this case, we can define\r
E[ξ] = R\r
∂C\r
(Q[ξ] − ξ · B) .\r

5.2 Definition of χ\r
Using the notation above, we can now define the form χ described in section 2.3 as\r
χ = δQ[ξB] − ξB · Θ(δφ) . (5.22)\r
As an example, the covariant formalism is applied to Einstein gravity plus a scalar field\r
in appendix C, leading to (4.26). In the rest of this section, we will demonstrate that χ\r
obeys the equations (4.14) and (4.15) that were needed to derive the equations of motion\r
from δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
. That χ also obeys eq. (4.16) will be shown in the next section. We\r
emphasize that it is the existence of a form χ with these properties that guarantees that the\r
linearized equations of motion are equivalent to δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
. Thus, starting from only\r
the entropy functional SWald, it should be possible to recover the linearized equations even if\r
we do not know χ, L, Θ, or Q.\r
The first property in eq. (4.14) follows directly from our definition (5.21) and the equiv\u0002alence of δE[ξB] and δEgrav , to be shown in the next section. The second property follows\r
from\r
δSgrav\r
B = δSWald =\r
Z\r
B˜\r
δQ[ξB] = Z\r
B˜\r
χ . (5.23)\r
The first equality was discussed in section 2.3, the third equality follows from the definition\r
of χ since ξB vanishes on B˜, and the second equality was proved in [27], as discussed in the\r
previous section. The proof in [27] does not use the equations of motion, so it holds off shell\r
if we define the entropy as in eq. (5.13).\r
To show eq. (4.15) note that for ξ a Killing vector of the background, eq. (5.18) implies\r
δJ[ξ] = d(ξ · Θ). Therefore\r
dχ = δ(dQ[ξB] − J[ξB]) = −ξ\r

that fields vanishing on the background do not contribute to the first variation of Ca, which is\r
why our derivation always gives the gravitational equations rather than the some combination\r
of gravitational and matter equations.\r
5.3 Equivalence of the holographic and the canonical modular energy\r
For arbitrary perturbations to AdS, we now have two definitions of modular energy associated\r
to a given boundary region B: the “canonical” energy (5.21)\r
δEgrav\r
(1) ≡ δE[ξB] ≡\r
Z\r
B\r
(δQ[ξB] − ξB · Θ(δφ)) (5.25)\r

defined in terms of the holographic stress tensor (4.13).\r
In order to complete our story, we must show that these two definitions of energy agree,\r
without assuming the equations of motion. This is not to say that the formulae agree for\r
arbitrary hµν – they do not. However, equivalence follows from the restrictions on the asymp\u0002totic metric implied by δSgrav\r
B = δEgrav\r
(2) . Note that the purely gravitational result of this\r
paper – that the linearized equations of motion are equivalent to δSgrav\r
B = δEgrav\r
(1) – does\r
not require the results of this subsection; it is needed only to map the CFT problem to the\r
gravity problem.\r
Consistency of the AdS/CFT dictionary requires the two definitions to agree, since both\r
should equal the CFT energy. This is confirmed for Einstein gravity in [31, 32], and rather\r
generally in [33], but these discussions rely on the equations of motion. Here we will demon\u0002strate the equivalence explicitly, at the linearized level, in a way that makes clear that we do\r
not need to start from the equations of motion. For simplicity, we assume in this calculation\r
that matter fields are not coupled to curvature, so only the metric appears in the linearized\r
energy.\r
As we discussed in section 4.1 and will show in more detail in section 6, metric perturba\u0002tions for which the first law is satisfied at leading order in the R expansion behave near the\r
boundary as\r
hµν = z\r
d−2h(d)\r
µν + . . . (5.27)\r
where the dots indicate terms at higher order in z. Other fall-offs, with δSgrav\r
B = 0, are also\r
allowed; these are addressed below. The holographic stress tensor is proportional to h\r

C1 = C2 by an explicit computation. However, since this can be a bit tedious in an arbitrary\r
higher derivative gravity theory, we present below a slightly indirect but simpler argument\r
that the two constants must be the same.\r
To show that the coefficients C1 and C2 are equal, we use the fact that, according to our\r
definition, the entanglement first law is\r
δSgrav\r
B = δEgrav\r

As R → 0, the middle term in this equation is proportional to (C1 − C2)Rd. On the other\r
hand, the term on the right-hand side starts at O(Rd+2), because h\r
(d)\r
µν satisfies the linearized\r
equations of motion at leading order, as can be explicitly checked. Thus\r
δEgrav\r
(1) = δEgrav(2) (5.33)\r
for these modes.\r
As we discuss in section 6.3, the other fall-offs allowed by first law are those for which\r
δSgrav\r
B = 0 as R → 0. These behave near the boundary as\r
hµν = z\r
∆−2h∆\r
µν + · · · (5.34)\r
for particular values of ∆ > d − 2, given in eq. (6.37). These modes do not appear in the\r
holographic stress tensor, so do not contribute to δEgrav\r
(2) . Their contribution to δEgrav(1) is\r
proportional to z\r
∆−d as z → 0, and thus vanishes if ∆ > d. This means that our entire\r
analysis applies to modes with ∆ > d, so the linearized equations of motion hold everywhere.\r
Furthermore, since ∆ depends on the parameters in the Lagrangian, and δEgrav\r
(1) must also\r
depend smoothly on these parameters, this conclusion also applies to modes with ∆ < d.\r
Alternatively, it can be checked explicitly that such modes obey the leading equations of\r
motion near the boundary (there is a single term to check because ∆ > d − 2) so eq. (5.32)\r
implies δEgrav\r
(1) = δEgrav(2) .\r
Applying this discussion in an arbitrary frame, we have now established that, at the\r
boundary, χ is equal to the conserved current that appears in the modular energy:\r
χ|∂M = dΣ\r
µ Tgrav\r
µν ζ\r
ν\r
. (5.35)\r
Conservation and traceless of the CFT stress tensor therefore imply dχ|∂M = 0, completing\r
the derivation in section 4.\r
6 Application: the holographic dictionary in higher curvature gravity\r
In section 4.1, we have argued that in the limit R → 0, the entanglement first law, together\r
with the holographic entanglement functional, yields the holographic dictionary for the stress\r
tensor. As a concrete and non-trivial application of this observation, in this section we derive\r
the holographic dictionary for the case when the entanglement entropy is given by a Wald\r
functional that is polynomial in the Riemann tensor — in other words, for a higher derivative\r
gravity theory whose action is constructed from arbitrary powers of the Riemann tensor, but\r
no derivatives thereof. The analysis including derivatives of the Riemann tensor is similar —\r
and straightforward in any particular example — but we leave it to future work. As we will\r
– 24 –

show, in this case the entanglement first law allows one to derive holographic dictionary not\r
only for the stress tensor, but also for the other operators that couple to the metric in the\r
context of higher derivative gravity.\r
The usual procedure for finding the holographic dictionary for an arbitrary gravitational\r
theory in AdS is holographic renormalization [24–26]. This technique provides full information\r
about the holographic dictionary, allowing both arbitrary sources and expectation values. One\r
can thus compute, in principle at least, any desired correlator of the stress tensor and the\r
other operators that couple to classical fields in the bulk. Nevertheless, computations that use\r
this method can become extremely tedious in the context of higher derivative gravity. The\r
reason is that a necessary first step in holographic renormalization is to render the variational\r
principle at the spacetime boundary well-defined, and this can be rather difficult in a general\r
higher derivative gravity theory (e.g. [33, 34]).\r
However, if one is only interested in computing the expectation value of the stress tensor\r
in higher derivative gravity rather than its general correlation functions, the “entanglement\r
first law” method for deriving the holographic dictionary can provide an easy alternative. The\r
reason for this simplification — besides not having to deal with the variational principle —\r
is that one can perform all calculations at linearized level, where all higher derivative gravity\r
theories effectively reduce to R2theories. A scaling argument can then be used to argue that\r
the linearized answer holds quite generally.\r

they can be expressed entirely in terms of products of the unperturbed AdS metric, with\r
various contractions and symmetrizations. Letting\r
δgab = −h\r

the general form of the linearized δEabcd\r

the last three from the partial derivative with respect to the Riemann tensor, evaluated on\r
AdS. All indices are raised and contracted with the background metric g\r
ab. Note that not all\r
coefficients ciintroduced above are independent, but rather they satisfy\r
c2 = −2d c4 − c5 , c3 = 2 c1 − (d − 1) c5 − 4 c6 . (6.12)\r
These constraints follow from the fact that the most general Wald functional that is linear in\r
the Riemann tensor takes the form (6.27) — see below — which is parametrized by just four\r
constants. Eq. (6.28) then shows that the six coefficients ci satisfy two additional relations.\r

To finalize our computation of the linearized Wald functional, we only need to evaluate\r
the linearized Riemann tensor, given by\r

For the computation of the holographic stress tensor (6.1), we only need the leading behaviour\r
of the Riemann tensor as R → 0. This can be easily evaluated by noting that z ∝ R and z\u0002derivatives of the metric perturbation dominate over x\r

Using eq. (6.14), it is not hard to verify that the leading contribution in eq. (6.17) scales as\r

This gives the holographic stress for a theory in which the Wald entropy is an arbitrary\r
function of the Riemann tensor, but not its covariant derivatives. The coefficients ci are\r
defined in eqs. (6.8) and (6.11).\r
Note that to this point, we have only been considering the leading contribution to the\r
expectation value of the stress tensor. That is, as noted in footnote 4, we are considering\r
a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i with |Ψ(0)i = |0i and within this family, δhTµν i ≡\r
∂λhTµν i|λ=0. However, we will now argue that our result extends beyond this leading order to\r
give a general prescription for hTµν i. In particular, the fact that hTµν i ∝ h\r
(d)\r
µν simply follows\r
from conformal invariance: there is no other field in spacetime that has the correct tensor\r
structure and transformation properties under rescalings.\r
22 Thus, the above expression for the\r
stress tensor holds even when h\r
(d)\r
µν is finite. Another way to see this fact is to note that since\r
21When α + β d = 0, the vanishing of the trace of the stress tensor no longer implies h(d)µ\r
µ = 0. Using our\r
results from section 6.3, it is easy to check that precisely at this value of the ci, the additional scalar operator\r
present in higher curvature gravity — which couples to the trace of the metric — has dimension ∆ = d, and\r
thus appears at the same order in the asymptotic z expansion as the traceless mode that couples to the CFT\r
stress tensor.\r
22There are a few exceptions to this, such as a gauge field in three space-time dimensions, which can\r
contribute to the stress tensor at quadratic order, or when fields have finely-tuned dimensions that can add\r
up to d.\r

requires that ε << 1, see also the appendix of [35]. Thus, we can either have hTtti small and\r
R finite, or hTtti finite and R → 0. In the first case, we can derive the linearized gravitational\r
equations in the entire bulk, by taking the amplitude of the perturbation to be small and\r
using the Wald functional method. In the second case, we can derive the leading asymptotic\r
expansion of the metric (as z → 0) for a general non-linear solution.\r
6.2 Examples\r
We now give some explicit examples employing the general formula (6.24) and compare with\r
known results in the literature.\r
6.2.1 The holographic stress tensor in R2 gravity\r
To begin, consider the case of an arbitrary R2 gravity theory in d + 1 dimensions, which\r
contains all possible contractions of the Riemann tensor but no derivatives thereof. It is\r
convenient to write the most general Lagrangian of such a theory as\r

where ˜ℓ is the scale parametrizing the (negative) cosmological constant. We also use ˜ℓ to set\r
the scale in the curvature-squared terms, which leaves ai as dimensionless couplings controlling\r
the strength of these interactions. We assume that the parameters are chosen such that the\r
theory admits an AdSd+1 vacuum solution of radius ℓ. In fact, it is straightforward to show\r
the AdS radius is determined by the parameters in the Lagrangian (6.25) by the following\r

We have checked that eq. (6.29) agrees perfectly with previous results in the literature that\r
used more standard holographic techniques: see, for example, equation (51) of [36] for the\r
case d = 3. We have also checked that in general d our answer agrees with the holographic\r
stress tensor of [34], when the results of that paper are applied to a flat boundary metric\r
and the volume divergences are subtracted. Note that the covariant expression of [34] for the\r
holographic stress tensor in terms of induced fields at the boundary obscures somewhat the\r
simplicity of the final answer (6.29) for hTµν i, which is dictated by scaling.23\r

This particular example has been studied previously in section 3.4 of [36], for the case d = 3.\r
The authors of that paper were investigating black hole thermodynamics in the above theory,\r
and found that in order for the first law to hold, the mass of the black hole had to be\r
independent of the coefficient of the R4term. In this subsection, we will use the holographic\r
entanglement method for computing the stress tensor expectation value to confirm their result.\r

in [36] for the metric of the black hole in presence of the R4\r
term shows that h00 = m is\r
uncorrected by the higher derivative term. Hence we also conclude that the mass of the black\r
hole is uncorrected, in agreement with the expectation of [36].\r
6.3 Other terms in the FG expansion\r
A feature of higher derivative gravity is the existence of additional degrees of freedom con\u0002tained in the metric. This occurs because the equations of motion are no longer second order.\r
These new degrees of freedom will appear as new terms in the asymptotic FG expansion,\r
which according to the usual AdS/CFT lore will represent new operators in the dual CFT.\r
Here we show how the entanglement first law can be used to derive the FG expansion for\r
these new modes, including a derivation of the conformal dimensions of the CFT operators\r
to which they couple.\r
Of course, the physical interpretation of these modes is unclear. First, they typically have\r
negative norm indicating that the boundary theory is no longer unitary [37], and second,\r
their masses are typically at the string scale where the low energy effective field theory is\r
unreliable. Nonetheless, they do satisfy the equations of motion, so we can ask how they fit\r
mathematically into our discussion of the first law.\r
These new modes appear as additional solutions to the first law constraint δSgrav\r
B =\r

B\r
. Previously, we argued that a metric perturbation of the form (6.14) that satisfies the\r
first law relation must have ∆ = d and be related to the stress tensor expectation value as\r
we described in the preceding section. Nevertheless, perturbations with ∆ 6= d, with ∆ an\r
arbitrary real number, are also allowed, as long as they satisfy δSgrav\r
B = 0.\r
To show how this works explicitly, we consider the example of general R2 gravity, with\r
Lagrangian given by eq. (6.25). We consider a metric perturbation of the form (6.14). The x\r
integral in eq. (6.6) is convergent as long as ∆ > d − 2. Performing this integral, we find\r

operator dimension that was obtained in [36], also by solving the asymptotic equations of\r
motion. Therefore, imposing δSgrav\r
B = 0 as R → 0 ensures that the asymptotic equations of\r
motion are satisfied, a claim which we use in section 5.3.\r
7 Discussion\r
In this paper, we have seen that a universal relation between entanglement entropy and ‘mod\u0002ular’ energy for small perturbations to the vacuum state of a CFT leads, in the holographic\r
context, to a nonlocal constraint on the dual spacetimes, which is exactly equivalent to the\r
linearized gravitational equations. Thus, given any holographic CFT, we can derive the lin\u0002earized bulk equations knowing only the entanglement functional. Moreover, as we showed\r
in sections 4.1 and 6, we can also derive the asymptotic boundary conditions for the metric\r
perturbation, as well as an expression for the holographic stress tensor. When matter cou\u0002plings to curvature vanish, these results taken together imply that from the entanglement\r
functional, we can derive the complete map from states to metrics at the linearized level\r
about the vacuum.\r
We have also shown that this non-local gravitational constraint is precisely the first law\r
of black hole thermodynamics (in the form proved by Iyer and Wald) applied to certain\r
24Of course, only the ∆+\r
S,T solutions are physical, since only for them does the x integral converge. It is\r
interesting though that the δSgrav\r
B = 0 constraint also knows about the non-normalizable modes in gravity,\r
including the perturbation of the boundary metric, with ∆ = 0.\r

On the AdS solution of radius ℓ, the relationship between ℓ and ℓ˜ is given in eq. (6.26).\r
– 32 –

Rindler patches of pure AdS that can be also interpreted as zero-mass hyperbolic black holes.\r
Thus, we have a result that holds purely in classical gravity: in any classical gravitational\r
theory for which anti-de Sitter space is a solution and for which the first law of black hole\r
thermodynamics holds for some Wald functional SWald, small perturbations about the AdS\r
vacuum solution are governed by the linearized gravitational equations obtained from varying\r
the Lagrangian associated to SWald. This provides a converse to the theorem of Iyer and Wald,\r
but also a microscopic understanding of the origin of the Iyer-Wald first law for AdS-Rindler\r
horizons.\r
Relation to the work of Jacobson\r
The results in this paper are reminiscent of (and partly motivated by) the work of Jacob\u0002son [17] (see also [38–40]). There, it was shown that if the first law of thermodynamics –\r
governing the local change in entropy (defined to be horizon area) as a certain bulk energy\r
flows through the horizon – is assumed to hold for an arbitrary Rindler horizon, then the\r
full nonlinear Einstein equations must be satisfied. In Jacobson’s case, there was no micro\u0002scopic understanding of the meaning of the entropy, and thus no fundamental understanding\r
of why the thermodynamic relation should hold. By contrast, in our case there is a pre\u0002cise microscopic understanding of both the energy and the entropy appearing in our relation\r
δSB = δEB, and a proof of the first law at the microscopic level. Also, our gravity analysis\r
applies to an arbitrary higher curvature theory, a scenario that is problematic with Jacobson’s\r
approach [39]. On the other hand, because our proof is based on global rather than local\r
Rindler horizons, we were only able to obtain the gravitational equations of motion at the\r
linearized level.\r
Deriving the nonlinear equations?\r
It is obviously interesting to ask whether we can extend our results to the nonlinear level.\r
On the CFT side, the entanglement entropies for finite perturbations to the vacuum state are\r
still constrained by the modular energies, but the constraint is the inequality ∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi\r
following from the positivity of relative entropy. For any ball-shaped region, we can still\r
translate this inequality to a constraint on the bulk metric. The set of all such constraints\r
should significantly restrict the allowed bulk spacetimes, but it seems unlikely that these\r
restrictions will fully determine the bulk equations at the nonlinear level. In particular, the\r
nonlinear gravitational equations are sensitive to all the other fields present in the classical\r
bulk theory, including the components of the metric along any extra compact directions.\r
These additional degrees of freedom depend significantly on which holographic CFT we are\r
considering. Thus, starting from the universal relation ∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi (or any other universal\r
relation for holographic CFTs) one might realistically expect to recover only a part of the\r
constraints implied by the full non-linear equations; for example, one might obtain Einstein’s\r

bulk.\r

Another interesting possibility is that one might be able to obtain some constraints at\r
the nonlinear level in the bulk even from the linearized entanglement first law, by considering\r
bulk perturbations which are kept finite but taken to be localized closer and closer to the\r
AdS-Rindler horizon. In such a limit, the energy perturbation in the CFT vanishes due to\r
gravitational redshift effects. By considering infinitesimal perturbations away from this limit,\r
the linearized CFT first law should apply, but on the gravity side, it would appear that we\r
will obtain constraints on a finite perturbation localized near the horizon. This may be closely\r
related to the approach of Jacobson.\r
Quantum first law in the bulk\r
Finally, it would be interesting to understand the implications of the entanglement first law (in\r
its infinitesimal form) beyond the classical level on the gravity side. Since the entanglement\r
first law is an exact relation, it can also be used to study subleading quantum gravitational\r
corrections to the classical results that we have derived, or CFT states that do not have\r
a classical bulk interpretation. These quantum states/corrections can be easily identified\r
by the scaling of their energy and entropy with the central charge in the CFT: while the\r
classical contributions are proportional to the central charge, the quantum ones scale with a\r
lower power of it. Thus, the first law should place constraints on the quantum behaviour of\r
the bulk gravitational theory and will likely also involve an understanding of the quantum\r
corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as discussed recently in [41–43].\r

A Vanishing of the integrand\r

d−1x dz f(~x, z) = 0 ∀R, ~x0 (A.1)\r
– 34 –

where Σ(R, ~x0) is the region z ≥ 0, |~x − ~x0|\r
2 + z2 ≤ R2\r
. We would like to show that (A.1)\r
implies that f = 0. To prove this, differentiate the integral, and define\r

dA xif = 0 (A.3)\r
where dA represents the area element on B˜. Now we can repeat the argument replacing\r
f → x\r
if in (A.1), and deduce that all moments of f vanish on every hemisphere B˜. We\r
conclude that f = 0, as we needed to show.\r
An alternative argument for the vanishing of f is to note that the integral in (A.3), viewed\r
as a map from B˜ to R, defines the “hyperbolic Radon transform” of the function f, whose\r
vanishing implies the vanishing of the function, assuming that f is continuous [44].\r
B Noether identities and the off-shell Hamiltonian\r
In this section, we derive the Noether identities for diffeomorphism invariance, and show that\r

Under a diffeomorphism, the variation of the action I is\r

Next, remember that the Noether current (5.6) satisfies dJ[ξ] = −εEφ\r
δξφ. Using (B.2)\r
and the Noether identity, this becomes\r
dJ[ξ] = d(ξ\r
aCa) (B.4)\r
for all diffeomorphisms ξ. It follows that [30]\r
J[ξ] = dQ[ξ] + ξ\r

for some Q, which we take to be the off-shell definition of the Noether charge Q.\r

D Form of the bulk charge\r
In this appendix, we show that the linearized modular energy defined by the bulk Wald\u0002Noether procedure always take the simple form noted in eq. (5.29). We start with eq. (5.25),\r
reproduced here for convenience:\r
δEgrav\r
(1) =\r
Z\r
B\r
(δQ[ξB] − ξB · Θ(δφ)) (D.1)\r
– 36 –

where the Killing vector ξB is given in eq. (3.1). Into this equation we would like to substitute\r
the asymptotic form of the metric perturbation (5.27), representing the stress tensor pertur\u0002bation. As we argued in the main text, modes with different falloffs will not contribute, since\r
they have the wrong scaling dimension.\r
As shown in [16], the most general form of Q[ξ] is\r
Q[ξ] = Xcd∇[cξd] + Wcξ\r
c + Y(φ,Lξφ) + dZ(ξ, φ) (D.2)\r
where Y is linear in Lξφ, Z is linear in ξ, and all forms are covariant expressions constructed\r
from the fields. We assume there is no matter with linear couplings to curvature. The general\r
covariant form of Xcd is\r
Xcd = X\r
abcdεab (D.3)\r
where Xabcd is antisymmetric in both is first two and last two indices. Using symmetry and\r
arguments similar to those in section 6, at zeroth and first order around AdS and to leading\r
in the z expansion, we must have (ignoring coefficients)\r

Using eq. (D.4), the leading behaviour of the linearized quantities reads\r
δXtztz ∝ z\r

µν ) , δXtzti ∝ z7\r
(∂ihtt + . . .) , δ(∇[zξt]) ∝ ζ\r
t\r
∂zhtt (D.7)\r
It is clear from the above expressions that only the leading terms in Xtztz and δXtztz will\r
contribute as z → 0. Plugging in the z-dependence of hµν , one finds that all the non-vanishing\r
contributions are proportional to h\r

(D.8)\r
where we used the fact that limz→0 ξ\r
t = ζt\r
.\r
The contribution of the Wcξ\r
c = Wtζt\r
term is easy to evaluate, taking into account the\r
fact that the d − 1 form Wc is a covariant expression constructed from hab, gab and their\r

background covariant derivatives. The most general form of Wc, linearized around AdS, is\r
thus\r

The only non-zero contribution on B will be from F\r

The ξ · Θ term in eq. (D.2) has the same form as Wcξ\r
c\r
so can be treated similarly.\r
The term Y in eq. (D.2) comes from the ambiguity Θ → Θ + dY(δφ). Together, these\r
terms contribute to χ in the combination\r
δY(δξφ) − δξY(δφ) . (D.11)\r
This vanishes for a background Killing vector.\r
Finally, the dZ term is an ambiguity that comes from the fact that Q is only defined by\r
its derivative. We fix this ambiguity to zero by requiring that there are no boundary terms\r
in the horizon entropy.\r

Abstract:\r
Entanglement entropy obeys a ‘first law’, an exact quantum generalization of the ordinary\r
first law of thermodynamics. In any CFT with a semiclassical holographic dual, this first\r
law has an interpretation in the dual gravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes\r
dual to CFT states. For small perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that\r
the set of such constraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly equivalent\r
to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational equations of motion,\r
linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement entropy computed by the Ryu\u0002Takayanagi formula S = A/(4GN), we obtain the linearized Einstein equations. For theories\r
in which the vacuum entanglement entropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald\r
functionals, we obtain the linearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories.\r
Using the first law, we also derive the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor, given the\r
holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a simple alternative to\r
holographic renormalization for computing the stress tensor expectation value in arbitrary\r
higher derivative gravitational theories.

According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, spacetime and gravitational physics in AdS\r
emerge from the dynamics of certain strongly-coupled conformal field theories with a large\r
number of degrees of freedom. A central question is to understand why and how this hap\u0002pens. In recent work, it has been suggested that the physics of quantum entanglement plays\r
an essential role, e.g. [1–5]. This was motivated in part by the importance of quantum en\u0002tanglement for understanding quantum phases of matter in condensed matter systems [6].\r
Ryu and Takayanagi have proposed [1, 2] that entanglement entropy, one measure of en\u0002tanglement between subsets of degrees of freedom in general quantum systems, provides a\r
direct window into the emergent spacetime geometry, giving the areas of certain extremal\r
surfaces. This provides a quantitative connection between CFT entanglement and the dual\r
spacetime geometry. Recently, this connection has been utilized to understand the emergence\r
of spacetime dynamics (i.e. gravity) from the CFT physics [7]. Making use of a ‘first law’\r
for entanglement entropy derived in [8], it was shown [7] that in any holographic theory for\r
which the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription computes the entanglement entropy of the boundary\r
CFT, spacetimes dual to small perturbations of the CFT vacuum state must satisfy Einstein’s\r
equations linearized around pure AdS spacetime.\r
In this paper, we provide further insight into the results of [7, 8] and extend them to\r
general holographic CFTs, for which the classical bulk equations may include terms at higher\r
order in the curvatures or derivatives. We show further that the first law for entanglement\r
entropy in the CFT can be understood as the microscopic origin of a particular case of the\r
first law of black hole thermodynamics, applied to AdS-Rindler horizons. We begin with a\r
brief review of some essential background before summarizing our main results.\r
The ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy\r
The crucial piece of CFT physics giving rise to linearized gravitational equations in the dual\r
theory is a ‘first law’ of entanglement entropy,\r
δSA = δhHAi (1.1)\r
equating the first order variation in the entanglement entropy for a spatial region A with\r
the first order variation in the expectation value of HA, the modular (or entanglement)\r
Hamiltonian. The latter operator is defined as the logarithm of the unperturbed state, i.e.\r
ρA ≃ e\r
−HA — see section 2.1 for further details. The first law was derived in [8]\r
1 as a special\r
case of a more general result for finite perturbations\r
∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi (1.2)\r
obtained using the positivity of ‘relative entropy’.2 A more direct demonstration of (1.1) is\r
reviewed in section 2.1 below.\r
1Related observations had been made independently using various holographic calculations, e.g. [9].\r
2Relative entropy can be viewed as a statistical measure of the distance between two states (i.e. density\r
matrices) in the same Hilbert space — e.g. see [10, 11] for reviews.\r

In general, the modular Hamiltonian HA is a complicated object that cannot be expressed\r
as an integral of local operators. However, starting from the vacuum state of a CFT in flat\r
space and taking A to be a ball-shaped spatial region of radius R centered at x0, denoted\r
B(R, x0), the modular Hamiltonian is given by a simple integral [12]\r

respectively.\r
The holographic interpretation\r
For conformal field theories with a gravity dual, the first law for ball-shaped regions can be\r
translated into a geometrical constraint obeyed by any spacetime dual to a small perturbation\r
of the CFT vacuum. To understand this, we first recall the holographic interpretation of\r
entanglement entropy and energy density in the general case (see section 2.3 for more details).\r
As shown by [12] in deriving (1.3), the vacuum entanglement entropy of a CFT for a\r
ball-shaped region in flat space can be reinterpreted as the thermal entropy of the CFT on\r
a hyperbolic cylinder at temperature set by the hyperbolic space curvature scale, by relating\r
the two backgrounds with a conformal mapping. For a holographic CFT, the latter thermal\r
entropy may then be calculated as the horizon entropy of the “black hole” dual to this thermal\r
state on hyperbolic space. In this case, the black hole is simply a Rindler wedge (which we\r
call the AdS-Rindler patch) of the original pure AdS space, as shown in figure 2. If the\r
gravitational theory in the bulk is Einstein gravity, then the horizon entropy is given by\r
the usual Bekenstein-Hawking formula, SBH = A/(4GN), and this construction [12] provides a\r
derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription [1] for a spherical entangling surface.3 However,\r
we note that the same analysis applies for any classical and covariant gravity theory in the\r
bulk, in which case the horizon entropy is given by Wald’s formula [14–16]\r

where L denotes the gravitational Lagrangian and nab is the binormal to the horizon H.\r
To summarize, in general holographic theories, entanglement entropy in the vacuum state\r
for a ball-shaped region B is computed by the Wald functional applied to the horizon of the\r
3Recently, this approach was extended to a general argument for the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for\r
arbitrary entangling surfaces in time-independent (and some special time-dependent) backgrounds [13].\r
– 3 –

AdS-Rindler patch associated with B. We will argue in section 2.3 that this should remain\r
true for perturbations to the vacuum state, so the left side of (1.4) computes the change in\r
entropy of the AdS-Rindler horizon under a small variation of the CFT state. Meanwhile, the\r
expectation value of the stress tensor is related to the asymptotic behaviour of the metric,\r
so the right side of (1.4) may be expressed as an integral involving the asymptotic metric\r
over a ball-shaped region of the boundary. In section 2.3, we show that this integral may\r
be interpreted as the variation in energy of the AdS-Rindler spacetime. Thus, the gravity\r
version of the entanglement first law (1.4) may be interpreted as a first law for AdS-Rindler\r
spacetimes. At a technical level, this represents a non-local constraint on the spacetime fields,\r
equating an integral involving the asymptotic metric perturbation over a boundary surface\r
to an integral involving the bulk metric perturbation (and possibly matter fields) over a bulk\r
surface.\r
Main results\r
Our first main result, presented in section 3, is that this first law for AdS-Rindler spacetimes,\r
i.e. the gravitational version of (1.4), is a special case of a first law proved by Iyer and\r
Wald for stationary spacetimes with bifurcate Killing horizons (i.e. at finite temperature) in\r
general classical theories of gravity. According to Iyer and Wald, for any perturbation of a\r
stationary background that satisfies the linearized equations of motion following from some\r
Lagrangian, the first law holds provided we define horizon entropy using the Wald functional\r
(1.5) associated with this Lagrangian. Thus, the CFT result (1.4) can be seen as an exact\r
quantum version of the Iyer-Wald first law, at least for the case of AdS-Rindler horizons.\r
Our second result, presented in sections 4 and 5, provides a converse to the theorem\r
of Iyer and Wald. In AdS space, we can associate an AdS-Rindler patch to any ball-shaped\r
spatial region on the boundary in any Lorentz frame, as in figure 2. An arbitrary perturbation\r
to the AdS metric can be understood as a perturbation to each of these Rindler patches. We\r
show that if the first law is satisfied for every AdS-Rindler patch, then the perturbation must\r
satisfy the linearized gravitational equations. Thus, the set of non-local constraints (one for\r
each ball-shaped region in each Lorentz frame) implied by (1.4) is equivalent to the set of\r
local gravitational equations.\r
The result in the previous paragraph – that the first law for AdS-Rindler patches implies\r
the linearized gravitational equations – is completely independent of AdS/CFT and holds for\r
any classical theory of gravity in AdS. However, since for holographic CFTs this gravitational\r
first law is implied by the entanglement first law, we conclude that the linearized gravita\u0002tional equations for the dual spacetime can be derived from any holographic CFT, given the\r
entanglement functional. This extends the results of [7] to general holographic CFTs.\r
As a further application of the entanglement first law, we point out (see section 4.1)\r
that eq. (1.1), applied to infinitesimal balls, can be used to deduce the ‘holographic stress\r
tensor,’ i.e. the gravitational quantity that computes the expectation value of the CFT\r
stress tensor, given the holographic prescription for computing entanglement entropy. This\r
provides a simple alternative approach to the usual holographic renormalization procedure,\r
– 4 –

as we illustrate with examples in section 6. Finally, we show that eq. (1.1) also provides\r
information about the operators in the boundary theory corresponding to additional degrees\r
of freedom that can be associated with the metric in the context of higher derivative gravity.\r
We conclude in section 7 with a brief discussion of our results. In particular, we discuss\r
the relation of our work to the work of Jacobson [17], who obtained gravitational equations\r
by considering a gravitational first law applied to local Rindler horizons."""

For any state in a general quantum system, the state of a subsystem A is described by\r

To understand the origin of this expression, we recall that the causal development6 D of\r
B is related by a conformal transformation to a hyperbolic cylinder H = Hd−1 × Rτ (time)\r
as shown in figure 1. As argued in [12], this transformation induces a map of CFT states that\r
takes the vacuum density matrix on B to the thermal density matrix ρH ∼ exp(−2πRHτ ) for\r
the CFT on hyperbolic space, where R is the curvature radius of the hyperbolic space and\r
Hτ is the CFT Hamiltonian generating time translations in H. The modular Hamiltonian for\r
ρH is then just 2πRHτ . Going back to D, it follows that the modular Hamiltonian for the\r
density matrix ρB is the Hamiltonian which generates the image under the inverse conformal\r
transformation of these time translations back in D, shown on the left in figure 1.\r
To obtain the explicit expression (2.5), we define ζB to be the image of the Killing vector\r

to the hemisphere B˜ = {t = t0, (x\r

[12], this is also the extremal surface in AdS bulk with boundary ∂B. Thus, the entanglement\r
entropy SB for the vacuum state can be calculated gravitationally by evaluating the Wald\r
functional (1.5) on the surface B˜.\r
If we consider a perturbation of the original vacuum state, the perturbation of the en\u0002tanglement entropy must equal the perturbation of the thermal entropy of the CFT on the\r
hyperbolic cylinder. Assuming that this equals the perturbation to the black hole entropy,\r
we must also have that δSgrav\r

known to differ from the Wald functional [21, 23] by terms quadratic in the extrinsic curvature\r
of the extremal bulk surface. These terms are important for arbitrarily-shaped entangling\r
surfaces or general states in the CFT. However, for the special case of a spherical entangling\r
surface considered here and a CFT in the vacuum, the extremal surface B˜ in the bulk is the\r

In holographic CFTs, whenever the gravitational observables corresponding to SB and EB\r

gives a prediction for the equivalence of two corresponding gravitational quantities, δSgrav\r
B\r
and δEgrav\r
B\r
, in any spacetime dual to a small perturbation of the CFT vacuum state. This\r
prediction must hold assuming the validity of the AdS/CFT correspondence and of our holo\u0002graphic interpretation of EB and SB. As we will see in the next section, the power of this\r
equivalence arises because in fact, we have an infinite number of predictions since δSB = δEB\r
can be applied for any ball-shaped region in any Lorentz frame in the boundary geometry. For\r
the case of Einstein gravity, where entanglement entropy is calculated by the Ryu-Takayanagi\r
proposal [1, 2], the equivalence of δSgrav\r
B\r
and δEgrav\r
B was confirmed in [8], and by a different\r
method in [7].\r
In this section, we will verify that δSgrav\r
B = δEgravB\r
follows from the equations of motion\r
in a general theory of gravity. The crucial observation, described in the previous section, is\r
that this gravitational relation can be interpreted as a statement of the equivalence of energy\r
and entropy for perturbations of AdS-Rindler space. This equivalence follows directly from\r
the generalized first law of black hole thermodynamics proved by Iyer and Wald [27].\r
The Iyer-Wald theorem states that for a stationary spacetime with a bifurcate Killing\r
horizon generated by a Killing vector ξ, arbitrary on-shell perturbations satisfy κ\r

δSWald =\r
δE[ξ]. Here SWald is the Wald entropy defined in the introduction, E[ξ] is a canonical energy\r
associated to the Killing vector ξ and κ is the surface gravity: ξ\r
a∇aξb = κ ξb on the horizon.\r
The key observation that connects this to our holographic version of the entanglement\r
first law is that the Iyer-Wald theorem applies to AdS-Rindler horizons. It is straightforward\r
to check that the vector\r

is an exact Killing vector of the standard Poincar´e metric (2.12), which vanishes on B˜(R, ~x0).\r
This vector is in fact proportional to ∂τ in the AdS-Rindler coordinates (2.11). Thus, the\r
hemisphere B˜ is the bifurcation surface of the Killing horizon for ξB and the region Σ(R, ~x0)\r
enclosed by B˜ and B is a spacelike slice that plays the role of the black hole exterior. The\r
Iyer-Wald theorem applies, and the Killing vector has been normalized such that κ = 2π, so\r

Turning the nonlocal constraint into a local equation\r
To convert the nonlocal integral equations into a local equation, the strategy is to make use\r
of the machinery used by Iyer and Wald to derive the first law from the equations of motion.\r
The Iyer-Wald formalism is reviewed in detail in the next section, but for now we just need\r

χ = δSgrav\r

The first law follows immediately by writing R\r
Σ\r
dχ = 0 and applying Stokes theorem (i.e.\r
integrating by parts).\r
To derive local equations from the gravitational first law, we will show that there exists\r
a form χ which satisfies the relations (4.14) off shell, and whose derivative is\r

ab are\r
the linearized gravitational equations of motion. In addition, we will require that\r
dχ|∂M = 0 (4.16)\r
where ∂M is the AdS boundary, assuming the tracelessness and conservation of the holo\u0002graphic stress tensor.11 This ensures that the energy E\r

time components of ξ\r

and ε\r
b are non-vanishing, so only the tt component of the gravitational\r
equations appears on the right-hand side of eq. (4.15).\r
The derivation of these statements in a general theory of gravity relies on the Iyer-Wald\r

H\r
Xcdncd , (5.13)\r
where H is the bifurcation surface and ncd is the binormal to H. This definition also applies\r
to linearized excitations of a stationary background. It is related to the Noether charge as\r
follows. Let ξ be the Killing vector that generates the horizon and vanishes on H. In general,\r
∇[cξd] = κ ncd on the horizon, where κ is the surface gravity. If we normalize ξ so that κ = 2π,\r
then the Wald entropy equals the Noether charge\r

Definition of energy\r
For perturbations of the background spacetime, we can define an energy canonically associated\r

ω(δ1φ, δ2φ) = δ2Θ(δ1φ) − δ1Θ(δ2φ) , (5.15)\r
the Hamiltonian that generates translations along ξ\r

δJ[ξ] = δΘ(δξφ) − ξ · dΘ(δφ) (5.17)\r
= ω(δξφ, δφ) + d(ξ · Θ(δφ)) (5.18)\r
where we used the background equations of motion Eφ = 0 and the formula for the Lie\r
derivative of a form,\r

In order to complete our story, we must show that these two definitions of energy agree,\r
without assuming the equations of motion. This is not to say that the formulae agree for\r
arbitrary hµν – they do not. However, equivalence follows from the restrictions on the asymp\u0002totic metric implied by δSgrav\r
B = δEgrav\r
(2) . Note that the purely gravitational result of this\r
paper – that the linearized equations of motion are equivalent to δSgrav\r
B = δEgrav\r
(1) – does\r
not require the results of this subsection; it is needed only to map the CFT problem to the\r
gravity problem.\r
Consistency of the AdS/CFT dictionary requires the two definitions to agree, since both\r
should equal the CFT energy. This is confirmed for Einstein gravity in [31, 32], and rather\r
generally in [33], but these discussions rely on the equations of motion. Here we will demon\u0002strate the equivalence explicitly, at the linearized level, in a way that makes clear that we do\r
not need to start from the equations of motion. For simplicity, we assume in this calculation\r
that matter fields are not coupled to curvature, so only the metric appears in the linearized\r
energy.\r
As we discussed in section 4.1 and will show in more detail in section 6, metric perturba\u0002tions for which the first law is satisfied at leading order in the R expansion behave near the\r

µν satisfies the linearized\r
equations of motion at leading order, as can be explicitly checked. Thus\r
δEgrav\r
(1) = δEgrav(2) (5.33)\r
for these modes.\r
As we discuss in section 6.3, the other fall-offs allowed by first law are those for which\r

hµν = z\r
∆−2h∆\r

(2) . Their contribution to δEgrav(1) is\r
proportional to z\r
∆−d as z → 0, and thus vanishes if ∆ > d. This means that our entire\r
analysis applies to modes with ∆ > d, so the linearized equations of motion hold everywhere.\r
Furthermore, since ∆ depends on the parameters in the Lagrangian, and δEgrav\r
(1) must also\r
depend smoothly on these parameters, this conclusion also applies to modes with ∆ < d.\r
Alternatively, it can be checked explicitly that such modes obey the leading equations of\r
motion near the boundary (there is a single term to check because ∆ > d − 2) so eq. (5.32)\r
implies δEgrav\r
(1) = δEgrav(2) .\r

In section 4.1, we have argued that in the limit R → 0, the entanglement first law, together\r
with the holographic entanglement functional, yields the holographic dictionary for the stress\r
tensor. As a concrete and non-trivial application of this observation, in this section we derive\r
the holographic dictionary for the case when the entanglement entropy is given by a Wald\r
functional that is polynomial in the Riemann tensor — in other words, for a higher derivative\r
gravity theory whose action is constructed from arbitrary powers of the Riemann tensor, but\r
no derivatives thereof. The analysis including derivatives of the Riemann tensor is similar —\r
and straightforward in any particular example — but we leave it to future work. As we will\r
– 24 –

show, in this case the entanglement first law allows one to derive holographic dictionary not\r
only for the stress tensor, but also for the other operators that couple to the metric in the\r
context of higher derivative gravity.\r
The usual procedure for finding the holographic dictionary for an arbitrary gravitational\r
theory in AdS is holographic renormalization [24–26]. This technique provides full information\r
about the holographic dictionary, allowing both arbitrary sources and expectation values. One\r
can thus compute, in principle at least, any desired correlator of the stress tensor and the\r
other operators that couple to classical fields in the bulk. Nevertheless, computations that use\r
this method can become extremely tedious in the context of higher derivative gravity. The\r
reason is that a necessary first step in holographic renormalization is to render the variational\r
principle at the spacetime boundary well-defined, and this can be rather difficult in a general\r
higher derivative gravity theory (e.g. [33, 34]).\r
However, if one is only interested in computing the expectation value of the stress tensor\r
in higher derivative gravity rather than its general correlation functions, the “entanglement\r
first law” method for deriving the holographic dictionary can provide an easy alternative. The\r
reason for this simplification — besides not having to deal with the variational principle —\r
is that one can perform all calculations at linearized level, where all higher derivative gravity\r
theories effectively reduce to R2theories. A scaling argument can then be used to argue that\r
the linearized answer holds quite generally."""

for some constant c1. The indices inside the h ,i brackets are (anti)symmetrized so that the\r

they can be expressed entirely in terms of products of the unperturbed AdS metric, with\r
various contractions and symmetrizations. Letting\r

the last three from the partial derivative with respect to the Riemann tensor, evaluated on\r
AdS. All indices are raised and contracted with the background metric g\r
ab. Note that not all\r
coefficients ciintroduced above are independent, but rather they satisfy\r
c2 = −2d c4 − c5 , c3 = 2 c1 − (d − 1) c5 − 4 c6 . (6.12)\r
These constraints follow from the fact that the most general Wald functional that is linear in\r
the Riemann tensor takes the form (6.27) — see below — which is parametrized by just four\r
constants. Eq. (6.28) then shows that the six coefficients ci satisfy two additional relations.\r

the linearized Riemann tensor, given by\r

For the computation of the holographic stress tensor (6.1), we only need the leading behaviour\r
of the Riemann tensor as R → 0. This can be easily evaluated by noting that z ∝ R and z\u0002derivatives of the metric perturbation dominate over x\r
µ\r
-derivatives as z → 0. More explicitly,\r
near the boundary we can write\r
hµν (z, xλ) = z\r
∆−2h(∆)\r
µν (x\r

for some ∆ to be determined, where the dots indicate terms at higher order in z. Then, we\r
can replace ∂zhµν = (∆ − 2)z\r
−1hµν and ignore all xµ\r
-derivatives, because ∂µ ∼ O(1) will\r
always be subleading in the R expansion, as compared to ∂z ∼ O(R−1). Consequently, in\r
taking R → 0, we can approximate19\r

Using eq. (6.14), it is not hard to verify that the leading contribution in eq. (6.17) scales as\r
R∆, so we must choose ∆ = d to obtain a finite result in eq. (6.1). Thus, we find again, as in\r
Einstein gravity, that in order for the first law of entanglement to be satisfied, the asymptotic\r

Note that to this point, we have only been considering the leading contribution to the\r
expectation value of the stress tensor. That is, as noted in footnote 4, we are considering\r
a one-parameter family of states |Ψ(λ)i with |Ψ(0)i = |0i and within this family, δhTµν i ≡\r

A feature of higher derivative gravity is the existence of additional degrees of freedom con\u0002tained in the metric. This occurs because the equations of motion are no longer second order.\r
These new degrees of freedom will appear as new terms in the asymptotic FG expansion,\r
which according to the usual AdS/CFT lore will represent new operators in the dual CFT.\r
Here we show how the entanglement first law can be used to derive the FG expansion for\r
these new modes, including a derivation of the conformal dimensions of the CFT operators\r
to which they couple.\r
Of course, the physical interpretation of these modes is unclear. First, they typically have\r
negative norm indicating that the boundary theory is no longer unitary [37], and second,\r
their masses are typically at the string scale where the low energy effective field theory is\r
unreliable. Nonetheless, they do satisfy the equations of motion, so we can ask how they fit\r
mathematically into our discussion of the first law.\r
These new modes appear as additional solutions to the first law constraint δSgrav\r

of solutions to the equations of motion in R2 gravity.25 Also, for d = 3, ∆+\r

agrees with the\r
operator dimension that was obtained in [36], also by solving the asymptotic equations of\r

In this paper, we have seen that a universal relation between entanglement entropy and ‘mod\u0002ular’ energy for small perturbations to the vacuum state of a CFT leads, in the holographic\r
context, to a nonlocal constraint on the dual spacetimes, which is exactly equivalent to the\r
linearized gravitational equations. Thus, given any holographic CFT, we can derive the lin\u0002earized bulk equations knowing only the entanglement functional. Moreover, as we showed\r
in sections 4.1 and 6, we can also derive the asymptotic boundary conditions for the metric\r
perturbation, as well as an expression for the holographic stress tensor. When matter cou\u0002plings to curvature vanish, these results taken together imply that from the entanglement\r
functional, we can derive the complete map from states to metrics at the linearized level\r
about the vacuum.\r
We have also shown that this non-local gravitational constraint is precisely the first law\r
of black hole thermodynamics (in the form proved by Iyer and Wald) applied to certain\r
24Of course, only the ∆+\r
S,T solutions are physical, since only for them does the x integral converge. It is\r
interesting though that the δSgrav\r
B = 0 constraint also knows about the non-normalizable modes in gravity,\r
including the perturbation of the boundary metric, with ∆ = 0.\r

Rindler patches of pure AdS that can be also interpreted as zero-mass hyperbolic black holes.\r
Thus, we have a result that holds purely in classical gravity: in any classical gravitational\r
theory for which anti-de Sitter space is a solution and for which the first law of black hole\r
thermodynamics holds for some Wald functional SWald, small perturbations about the AdS\r
vacuum solution are governed by the linearized gravitational equations obtained from varying\r
the Lagrangian associated to SWald. This provides a converse to the theorem of Iyer and Wald,\r
but also a microscopic understanding of the origin of the Iyer-Wald first law for AdS-Rindler\r
horizons.\r
Relation to the work of Jacobson\r
The results in this paper are reminiscent of (and partly motivated by) the work of Jacob\u0002son [17] (see also [38–40]). There, it was shown that if the first law of thermodynamics –\r
governing the local change in entropy (defined to be horizon area) as a certain bulk energy\r
flows through the horizon – is assumed to hold for an arbitrary Rindler horizon, then the\r
full nonlinear Einstein equations must be satisfied. In Jacobson’s case, there was no micro\u0002scopic understanding of the meaning of the entropy, and thus no fundamental understanding\r
of why the thermodynamic relation should hold. By contrast, in our case there is a pre\u0002cise microscopic understanding of both the energy and the entropy appearing in our relation\r
δSB = δEB, and a proof of the first law at the microscopic level. Also, our gravity analysis\r
applies to an arbitrary higher curvature theory, a scenario that is problematic with Jacobson’s\r
approach [39]. On the other hand, because our proof is based on global rather than local\r
Rindler horizons, we were only able to obtain the gravitational equations of motion at the\r
linearized level.\r
Deriving the nonlinear equations?\r
It is obviously interesting to ask whether we can extend our results to the nonlinear level.\r
On the CFT side, the entanglement entropies for finite perturbations to the vacuum state are\r
still constrained by the modular energies, but the constraint is the inequality ∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi\r
following from the positivity of relative entropy. For any ball-shaped region, we can still\r
translate this inequality to a constraint on the bulk metric. The set of all such constraints\r
should significantly restrict the allowed bulk spacetimes, but it seems unlikely that these\r
restrictions will fully determine the bulk equations at the nonlinear level. In particular, the\r
nonlinear gravitational equations are sensitive to all the other fields present in the classical\r
bulk theory, including the components of the metric along any extra compact directions.\r
These additional degrees of freedom depend significantly on which holographic CFT we are\r
considering. Thus, starting from the universal relation ∆SA ≤ ∆hHAi (or any other universal\r
relation for holographic CFTs) one might realistically expect to recover only a part of the\r
constraints implied by the full non-linear equations; for example, one might obtain Einstein’s\r
equations with the additional assumption that no other matter fields are turned on in the\r
bulk.\r
– 33 –

Another interesting possibility is that one might be able to obtain some constraints at\r
the nonlinear level in the bulk even from the linearized entanglement first law, by considering\r
bulk perturbations which are kept finite but taken to be localized closer and closer to the\r
AdS-Rindler horizon. In such a limit, the energy perturbation in the CFT vanishes due to\r
gravitational redshift effects. By considering infinitesimal perturbations away from this limit,\r
the linearized CFT first law should apply, but on the gravity side, it would appear that we\r
will obtain constraints on a finite perturbation localized near the horizon. This may be closely\r
related to the approach of Jacobson.\r
Quantum first law in the bulk\r
Finally, it would be interesting to understand the implications of the entanglement first law (in\r
its infinitesimal form) beyond the classical level on the gravity side. Since the entanglement\r
first law is an exact relation, it can also be used to study subleading quantum gravitational\r
corrections to the classical results that we have derived, or CFT states that do not have\r
a classical bulk interpretation. These quantum states/corrections can be easily identified\r
by the scaling of their energy and entropy with the central charge in the CFT: while the\r
classical contributions are proportional to the central charge, the quantum ones scale with a\r
lower power of it. Thus, the first law should place constraints on the quantum behaviour of\r
the bulk gravitational theory and will likely also involve an understanding of the quantum\r
corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula as discussed recently in [41–43].\r

where Σ(R, ~x0) is the region z ≥ 0, |~x − ~x0|\r

f → x\r
if in (A.1), and deduce that all moments of f vanish on every hemisphere B˜. We\r
conclude that f = 0, as we needed to show.\r
An alternative argument for the vanishing of f is to note that the integral in (A.3), viewed\r
as a map from B˜ to R, defines the “hyperbolic Radon transform” of the function f, whose\r
vanishing implies the vanishing of the function, assuming that f is continuous [44].\r

Next, remember that the Noether current (5.6) satisfies dJ[ξ] = −εEφ\r

and the Noether identity, this becomes\r
dJ[ξ] = d(ξ\r

for all diffeomorphisms ξ. It follows that [30]\r
J[ξ] = dQ[ξ] + ξ\r

D Form of the bulk charge\r
In this appendix, we show that the linearized modular energy defined by the bulk Wald\u0002Noether procedure always take the simple form noted in eq. (5.29). We start with eq. (5.25),\r
reproduced here for convenience:\r
δEgrav\r

Z\r
B\r
(δQ[ξB] − ξB · Θ(δφ)) (D.1)\r

where the Killing vector ξB is given in eq. (3.1). Into this equation we would like to substitute\r
the asymptotic form of the metric perturbation (5.27), representing the stress tensor pertur\u0002bation. As we argued in the main text, modes with different falloffs will not contribute, since\r
they have the wrong scaling dimension.\r
As shown in [16], the most general form of Q[ξ] is\r
Q[ξ] = Xcd∇[cξd] + Wcξ\r
c + Y(φ,Lξφ) + dZ(ξ, φ) (D.2)\r
where Y is linear in Lξφ, Z is linear in ξ, and all forms are covariant expressions constructed\r
from the fields. We assume there is no matter with linear couplings to curvature. The general\r
covariant form of Xcd is\r
Xcd = X\r
abcdεab (D.3)\r
where Xabcd is antisymmetric in both is first two and last two indices. Using symmetry and\r
arguments similar to those in section 6, at zeroth and first order around AdS and to leading\r
in the z expansion, we must have (ignoring coefficients)\r

(∂ihtt + . . .) , δ(∇[zξt]) ∝ ζ\r

∂zhtt (D.7)\r
It is clear from the above expressions that only the leading terms in Xtztz and δXtztz will\r
contribute as z → 0. Plugging in the z-dependence of hµν , one finds that all the non-vanishing\r
contributions are proportional to h\r

where we used the fact that limz→0 ξ\r

The contribution of the Wcξ\r
c = Wtζt\r
term is easy to evaluate, taking into account the\r
fact that the d − 1 form Wc is a covariant expression constructed from hab, gab and their\r

background covariant derivatives. The most general form of Wc, linearized around AdS, is\r

The ξ · Θ term in eq. (D.2) has the same form as Wcξ\r
c\r
so can be treated similarly.\r
The term Y in eq. (D.2) comes from the ambiguity Θ → Θ + dY(δφ). Together, these\r
terms contribute to χ in the combination\r
δY(δξφ) − δξY(δφ) . (D.11)\r
This vanishes for a background Killing vector.\r
Finally, the dZ term is an ambiguity that comes from the fact that Q is only defined by\r
its derivative. We fix this ambiguity to zero by requiring that there are no boundary terms\r
in the horizon entropy.\r
