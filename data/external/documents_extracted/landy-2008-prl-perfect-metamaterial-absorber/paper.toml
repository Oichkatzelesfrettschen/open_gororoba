We present the design for an absorbing metamaterial (MM) with near unity absorbance A\u0001!\u0002. Our\r
structure consists of two MM resonators that couple separately to electric and magnetic fields so as to\r
absorb all incident radiation within a single unit cell layer. We fabricate, characterize, and analyze a MM\r
absorber with a slightly lower predicted A\u0001!\u0002 of 96%. Unlike conventional absorbers, our MM consists\r
solely of metallic elements. The substrate can therefore be optimized for other parameters of interest. We\r
experimentally demonstrate a peak A\u0001!\u0002 greater than 88% at 11.5 GHz.\r

The nascent field of electromagnetic metamaterials\r
(MMs) has produced exotic effects such as negative index\r
of refraction [1,2], and devices such as an electromagnetic\r
cloak [3]. The realization of such properties lies in the\r
ability of metamaterials to create independent tailored\r
electric [4] and magnetic [5] responses to incident radia\u0002tion. Electromagnetic MMs are also geometrically scalable\r
which translates into operability over a significant portion\r
of the electromagnetic spectrum. To date, MMs have been\r
demonstrated in every technologically relevant spectral\r
range, from radio [6], microwave [7], mm-Wave [8], THz\r
[9], MIR [10], NIR [11], to the near optical [12]. These\r
designer materials are ideal for the investigation of novel\r
emergent physical phenomena while also holding great\r
promise for future applications.\r
As an effective medium [13], MMs can be characterized\r
by a complex electric permittivity \u0001~\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u00011 \u0005 i\u00012 and\r
magnetic permeability \u0002~\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u00021 \u0005 i\u00022. Much of the\r
work in MMs has been focussed on the real part of \u0001 and\r
\u0002 to enable the creation of a negative refractive material.\r
However, the oft-overlooked loss components of the opti\u0002cal constants (\u00012 and \u00022) have much potential for the\r
creation of exotic and useful materials as well. For ex\u0002ample, they can be manipulated to create a high absorber.\r
By manipulating resonances in \u0001 and \u0002 independently, it is\r
possible to absorb both the incident electric and magnetic\r
field. Additionally, by matching \u0001 and \u0002, a MM can be\r
impedance-matched to free space, minimizing reflectivity.\r
In this Letter, we show that MMs can be fashioned to create\r
narrow-band perfect absorbers (PAs), with the potential to\r
be used in devices such as in bolometers.\r
A single unit cell of the absorber consisted of two\r
distinct metallic elements as shown in Figs. 1(a) and\r
1(b). Electric coupling was supplied by the electric ring\r
resonator (ERR) [14], shown in Fig. 1(a). This element\r
consisted of two standard split ring resonators connected\r
by the inductive ring parallel to the split-wire. We used this\r
design instead of a conventional split-wire design because\r
of the limitations of straight wire media [15]; i.e., a split\u0002wire design has limited tunability beyond the addition of\r
more wires per unit cell to increase inductance [16]. The\r
magnetic coupling required a more complicated arrange\u0002ment, and thus in order to couple to the incident H-field,\r
we needed flux created by circulating charges perpendicu\u0002lar to the propagation vector. We created this response by\r
combining the center wire of the ERR with a cut wire\r
[Fig. 1(b)] in a parallel plane separated by a substrate\r
[Fig. 1(c)]. This design is similar to the so-called ‘‘fishnet’’\r
and paired nanorod structures [11,12], in that they derive a\r
magnetic response from driving two antiparallel currents in\r
conducting segments. We were then able to tune the mag\u0002netic response by changing the geometry of the cut wire\r
and the separation between the cut wire and electric reso\u0002nator. By manipulating the magnetic coupling without\r
changing the ERR, we were able to decouple \u0001 and \u0002\r
and individually tune each resonance.\r
We performed computer simulations of an ideal—but\r
realizable—MM absorber using the commercial finite\u0002difference time domain (FDTD) solver Microwave Studio\r
by CST [17]. The program simulated a single unit cell as\r
shown in Fig. 1(c) with appropriate boundary conditions,\r
i.e., perfect electric (y^ z^ -plane) and perfect magnetic\r
(x^ z^ -plane). Waveguide ports on the other boundaries\r
simulated a TEM plane wave propagating through the\r
medium. Simulation produced the complex frequency de\u0002pendent S parameters, S~\r

respectively. From the S parameter data, we inverted the\r
Fresnel equations to extract the complex optical constants\r
[18]. We then examined the behavior of the surface current\r
density, magnetic and electric fields at !0 to verify that we\r
were coupling to the correct resonant mode of each MM\r
element. By tuning !0 of the \u0001 and \u0002 resonances (not\r
shown), due to the two MM elements, we achieved \u0001 \u0004 \u0002\r
and thus an impedance near the free space value. While\r
100% absorbance is theoretically possible, it can only\r
occur when the MM layer is impedance-matched to free\r
space such that R\u0001!\u0002 is zero [19]. One may then minimize\r
T\u0001!\u0002 such that the addition of multiple layers ensures\r
T\u0001!\u0002 ! 0. The simulated MM had the dimensions, in\r
millimeters, of: a1 \u0004 4:2, a2 \u0004 12, W \u0004 3:9, G \u0004 0:606,\r
t \u0004 0:6, L \u0004 1:7, H \u0004 11:8, and the MM elements were\r
separated by 0.65 in the z^ direction. In Fig. 2, we show the\r
simulation results for the MM PA. R\u0001!\u0002 and absorbance\r
[A\u0001!\u0002] are plotted from zero to 100% (left axis), and T\u0001!\u0002\r
is plotted on the right axis from zero to 5%. R\u0001!\u0002 is large\r
\u000697% near the bounds of the plot, 9 GHz and 14 GHz, but\r
there is a minimum of 0.01% at !0 \u0007 11:65 GHz.\r
Simulated T\u0001!\u0002 also undergoes a minimum near !0 and\r
yields a value of \u00060:9%. Thus, we achieve a best simulated\r
A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 1 \u0003 T\u0001!\u0002 \u0003 R\u0001!\u0002 slightly less than unity A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004\r
99% with a FWHM of 4% compared to !0.\r
While our simulated absorber achieves narrow-band\r
high A\u0001!\u0002, we were restricted by the minimum line widths\r
available to us (250 \u0002m) and other various fabrication\r
tolerances. These limitations were incorporated into the\r
design process, and we fabricated a MM which deviated\r
slightly from the ideal absorber and had the dimensions, in\r
millimeters, of: a1 \u0004 4:2, a2 \u0004 12, W \u0004 4, G \u0004 0:6, t \u0004\r
0:6, L \u0004 1:7, H \u0004 11:8. Each metallization was fabricated\r
on a FR4 substrate with a thickness of 0.2 mm. MMs were\r
fabricated using standard optical lithography. The substrate\r
consisted of a photosensitized FR-4 board with a 17 \u0002m\r
copper thickness. A mask was designed and printed in high\r
resolution on a transparency, and each MM component was\r
fabricated by standard optical lithography processes. These\r
boards were then sandwiched (using an adhesive with\r
0.06 mm thickness) about another 0.2 mm thick FR4 blank\r
substrate to obtain the correct spacing. The end results was\r
that the MM elements were separated by 0.72 mm in the z^\r
direction. This allowed us to couple to both magnetic and\r
electric resonances without out-of-plane elements typical\r
with ‘‘wine-crate’’ designs [2].\r
We experimentally verified the behavior of the absorber\r
by measuring the complex S parameters of a large planar\r
array of pixels (outer dimensions of 15 \b 15 cm). We used\r
a vector network analyzer that produced microwaves in the\r
range of 8–12 GHz. One microwave horn focused the GHz\r
beam on the sample, and another horn served as a detector.\r
Both horns coupled to linearly polarized light and had\r
parallel polarization directions. To measure T\u0001!\u0002, we set\r
the horns in a normal incidence confocal configuration. We\r
performed R\u0001!\u0002 measurements at normal incidence.\r
However, in order to eliminate large voltage standing\r
wave ratios (VSWR) which would overwhelm the data,\r
we used a beam splitter configuration, shown as the inset to\r
Fig. 3(a). Radiation first traveled from the transmitting\r
horn through the beam splitter, reflected from the sample\r
and returned to the beam splitter where it was reflected at\r
45% to the receiving horn. We set the normalization and\r
phase in T\u0001!\u0002 configuration by simply removing the sam\u0002ple. For reflection, we replaced the sample with a perfect\r
reflector for normalized measurements. Transmission tech\u0002niques have been described elsewhere [20].\r
Simulations were performed for this MM structure and\r
are presented for comparison to experimental data. R\u0001!\u0002 is\r
shown as the black (red online) line in Fig. 3(a). At low\r
frequencies, the reflectivity is high and yields values near\r
95%. A large feature occurs in R\u0001!\u0002 and has a minimum of\r
\u00063% near 11.5 GHz. Likewise, T\u0001!\u0002, shown as the black\r
(red online) line in Fig. 3(b), has 4% T\u0001!\u0002 at low frequen\u0002cies and then undergoes a minimum near 11.25 GHz. A\u0001!\u0002\r
of our MM unit cell thus has a maximum near where both\r
R\u0001!\u0002 and T\u0001!\u0002 have their minima. We plot A\u0001!\u0002 as the\r

black (red online) line in Fig. 4 from 8 to 12 GHz.\r
Simulated A\u0001!\u0002 peaks at 96% at !0 \u0004 11:48 GHz and\r
has a FWHM of 4% with respect to !0.\r
By performing S parameter simulations, we are able to\r
account for the form of the experimental data. The mea\u0002sured R\u0001!\u0002 and T\u0001!\u0002 are plotted as the gray (blue online)\r
lines in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. We find excellent\r
agreement between simulated and measured T\u0001!\u0002 over all\r
frequencies characterized. The measured R\u0001!\u0002 is consis\u0002tently 8% lower than the simulated R\u0001!\u0002 at low frequen\u0002cies. Both the simulated and experimental R\u0001!\u0002 reach a\r
minimum at approximately 11.5 GHz, but experimentally,\r
the minimum is 11%, as opposed to the simulated value of\r
3%. There is also significant broadening in the experimen\u0002tal R\u0001!\u0002 line with respect to simulation. This is most likely\r
due to tolerances in the fabrication and assembly.\r
The experimental absorptivity A\u0001!\u0002 calculated from\r
T\u0001!\u0002 and R\u0001!\u0002 is shown as the gray (blue online) line in\r
Fig. 4. The simulated and experimental lines have maxi\u0002mum A\u0001!\u0002 at the same frequency, !max \u0004 11:5 GHz.\r
However, the simulated line reaches a maximum of 96%,\r
and the experimental line only reaches 88%, the difference\r
being primarily due to deviations in R\u0001!\u0002. Better fabrica\u0002tion and assembly tolerances will permit absorbances and\r
bandwidths similar to that shown as the black (red online)\r
line in Fig. 4. We performed simulations to verify the origin\r
of the broadening of A\u0001!\u0002. From a theoretical viewpoint, it\r
is expected that the frequency location of the A\u0001!\u0002 peak\r
depends significantly upon the separation between the\r
electric ring resonator and the cut wire, since this distance\r
determines the frequency location of the magnetic reso\u0002nance. Simulations verified this conjecture. We simulated\r
various spacings centered about the designed value of\r
0.72 mm, and computed a Gaussian weighted average\r
A\u0001!\u0002 with a standard deviation of \u0003 \u0004 20 \u0002m. The A\u0001!\u0002\r
calculated in this manner agrees very well with the experi\u0002mental line and is plotted as the gray dashed line in the\r
main panel of Fig. 4. Thus, assembly errors in the MM\r
spacing of only 5% can easily account for the disagreement\r
between the simulation and experiment shown in Fig. 4 as\r
the black and gray (red and blue online) lines, respectively.\r
An investigation into the effect of adding multiple MM\r
absorbing layers is shown in the main panel of Fig. 5. As\r
can be observed, A\u0001!\u0002 rises sharply with additional layers\r
and is asymptotic to unity, within computational noise.\r
Two layers of the MM absorber achieve a value of\r
\u000699:9972%. At this thickness, the entire MM is only\r
\u0006\u00040=2 at resonance. For the structure shown in Fig. 1,\r
A\u0001!0\u0002 can never reach unity since the MM is not perfectly\r
matched to free space. However, it is important to note that\r
although an impedance-matched structure may yield zero\r
R\u0001!0\u0002, this does not imply T\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 0. In this study, we are\r
interested in achieving R\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 T\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 0 in a single unit\r
cell in the propagation direction. Thus, our MM structure\r
was optimized to maximize the A\u0001!\u0002 with the restriction of\r
minimizing the thickness. If this constraint is relaxed,\r
impedance matching is possible, and with multiple layers,\r
a perfect A\u0001!\u0002 can be achieved.\r
We further investigated the origin of the loss in our MM,\r
as indicated in the inset to Fig. 5. The Ohmic ‘‘surface’’\r
loss is mainly from the center conducting region of the\r
ERR, and dielectric losses occur in between the two MM\r
elements where the electric field is large. The major com\u0002ponent responsible for A\u0001!\u0002 in our MM structure is the\r
dielectric loss, and simulation indicates this is an order of\r
magnitude greater than Ohmic losses. This is consistent\r
with studies of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) where it\r
was found that metallic absorption was relatively insignifi\u0002cant in comparison to dielectric losses [21].\r
We now discuss the potential application of a perfect\r
MM absorber as a bolometer. An ideal bolometric detector\r
is one in which all photons that fall upon its surface are\r
absorbed, converted to heat, and thus sensed [22]. A\r
prominent feature of commercially available bolometers\r
is their extreme bandwidth making them ideal candidates\r
as detectors, especially in the far infrared frequency regime\r
where other efficient detection methods are largely un\u0002available. However, bolometers which achieve a narrow\r
band response also have significant application as focal\r
plane array (FPA) detectors for imaging. The MM design\r
presented here achieves simulated absorbtivities near unity\r

making them ideal candidates for bolometric pixel ele\u0002ments. The natural narrow band MM resonance is a salient\r
feature for FPA detectors as it is naturally apodizing and\r
operates at room temperature. Since the elements which\r
constitute our bolometer are subwavelength, MMs can\r
inherently image at the diffraction limit. Further, here we\r
have used only a single unit cell in the propagation direc\u0002tion, (with a thickness significantly smaller than the wave\u0002length \u00040=35), yet achieved an experimental A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 88%.\r
By adding multiple layers, one can achieve narrow band\r
absorbance of unity. Although the design is planar and\r
A\u0001!\u0002 should fall off relatively rapidly, we investigated\r
the angular dependence (inset to Fig. 4) and found the\r
MM still achieved A \t :5 at an incident full-angle of\r
16
. Finally, MM scalability permits the usage of these\r
PAs at other wavelengths of interest, allowing for the\r
possibility of room temperature high resolution imaging\r
at mm-Wave and THz frequencies. We have designed\r
similar MMs (not shown) that achieved A \t 1 operating\r
at 94 GHz and 1 THz.\r
While the creation of a MM absorber is novel, the\r
technology to create absorptive materials in the microwave\r
frequency range is well established. A high-impedance\r
ground plane yields comparable absorbance, but requires\r
metalization in the propagation direction [23]. The mate\u0002rial ‘‘chiroshield’’ is capable of very high absorption, and\r
reduces backscatter by 15 to 25 dB [24], but has sizes on\r
the order of \u0004, which is 35 times larger than our design at a\r
given center frequency. Some ferrites show reflection loss\r
of \u000330 dB [25]; however, they lack the inherent and\r
precise tunability of MMs. Other work on bolometric\r
frequency-selective materials require cryogenic tempera\u0002tures to operate and only achieve A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 50% [26]. At\r
optical, metal colloides are known to have large absorptive\r
properties [27] due to the geometric specific surface modes\r
[28]. This suggests an interesting possible application of\r
artificial plasmonic wire media [4] to function as PAs [16]\r
operating at microwave frequencies.\r
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MMs can be\r
highly absorptive over a narrow frequency range. This\r
stems from the ability to design MM elements which can\r
individually absorb the electric and magnetic components\r
of an incident electromagnetic wave. In contrast, previous\r
experimental results at THz frequencies using a single type\r
of MM element (electric) yielded values of only A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004\r
\u000620% [29]. The resonant frequency of the MMs may be\r
tuned throughout some range of frequencies [30,31] thus\r
enabling hyperspectral imaging. A further benefit afforded\r
by MMs is the ability to construct a single unit cell with\r
\u0002\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u0001\u0001!\u0002 over an extended frequency range. Thus, this\r
unit cell can achieve zero R\u0001!\u0002 since it can have an\r
impedance equal to the free space value Z \u0004 \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002=\u0001 p \u0004 1.\r
This is similar to the well-known theoretical construct, the\r
Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) Absorbing Boundary\r
Condition (ABC) [32], which splits waves incident upon\r
a boundary into electric and magnetic components to ob\u0002tain near perfect absorption. The PML, however, requires\r
gain and additionally is on the order of \u00040=2 in thickness\r
[33].\r
The design presented here can still be improved. The\r
current design is polarization sensitive, which is not ideal\r
for some applications. By incorporating a substrate with a\r
highly consistent dielectric constant, we will be able to\r
optimize the design at the correct resonant frequency.\r
Similarly, tighter fabrication tolerances would allow us to\r
bring the impedance closer to unity and therefore closer to\r
A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 1. Additionally, the assembly is complicated due\r
the restrictions placed on the direction of the incident wave\r
to couple to the magnetic resonator. This resulted in unit\r
cell variation and a less distinct A\u0001!\u0002 peak.\r

We present the design for an absorbing metamaterial (MM) with near unity absorbance A\u0001!\u0002. Our\r
structure consists of two MM resonators that couple separately to electric and magnetic fields so as to\r
absorb all incident radiation within a single unit cell layer. We fabricate, characterize, and analyze a MM\r
absorber with a slightly lower predicted A\u0001!\u0002 of 96%. Unlike conventional absorbers, our MM consists\r
solely of metallic elements. The substrate can therefore be optimized for other parameters of interest. We\r
experimentally demonstrate a peak A\u0001!\u0002 greater than 88% at 11.5 GHz.\r

The nascent field of electromagnetic metamaterials\r
(MMs) has produced exotic effects such as negative index\r
of refraction [1,2], and devices such as an electromagnetic\r
cloak [3]. The realization of such properties lies in the\r
ability of metamaterials to create independent tailored\r
electric [4] and magnetic [5] responses to incident radia\u0002tion. Electromagnetic MMs are also geometrically scalable\r
which translates into operability over a significant portion\r
of the electromagnetic spectrum. To date, MMs have been\r
demonstrated in every technologically relevant spectral\r
range, from radio [6], microwave [7], mm-Wave [8], THz\r
[9], MIR [10], NIR [11], to the near optical [12]. These\r
designer materials are ideal for the investigation of novel\r
emergent physical phenomena while also holding great\r
promise for future applications.\r
As an effective medium [13], MMs can be characterized\r
by a complex electric permittivity \u0001~\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u00011 \u0005 i\u00012 and\r
magnetic permeability \u0002~\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u00021 \u0005 i\u00022. Much of the\r
work in MMs has been focussed on the real part of \u0001 and\r
\u0002 to enable the creation of a negative refractive material.\r
However, the oft-overlooked loss components of the opti\u0002cal constants (\u00012 and \u00022) have much potential for the\r
creation of exotic and useful materials as well. For ex\u0002ample, they can be manipulated to create a high absorber.\r
By manipulating resonances in \u0001 and \u0002 independently, it is\r
possible to absorb both the incident electric and magnetic\r
field. Additionally, by matching \u0001 and \u0002, a MM can be\r
impedance-matched to free space, minimizing reflectivity.\r
In this Letter, we show that MMs can be fashioned to create\r
narrow-band perfect absorbers (PAs), with the potential to\r
be used in devices such as in bolometers.\r
A single unit cell of the absorber consisted of two\r
distinct metallic elements as shown in Figs. 1(a) and\r
1(b). Electric coupling was supplied by the electric ring\r
resonator (ERR) [14], shown in Fig. 1(a). This element\r
consisted of two standard split ring resonators connected\r
by the inductive ring parallel to the split-wire. We used this\r
design instead of a conventional split-wire design because\r
of the limitations of straight wire media [15]; i.e., a split\u0002wire design has limited tunability beyond the addition of\r
more wires per unit cell to increase inductance [16]. The\r
magnetic coupling required a more complicated arrange\u0002ment, and thus in order to couple to the incident H-field,\r
we needed flux created by circulating charges perpendicu\u0002lar to the propagation vector. We created this response by\r
combining the center wire of the ERR with a cut wire\r
[Fig. 1(b)] in a parallel plane separated by a substrate\r
[Fig. 1(c)]. This design is similar to the so-called ‘‘fishnet’’\r
and paired nanorod structures [11,12], in that they derive a\r
magnetic response from driving two antiparallel currents in\r
conducting segments. We were then able to tune the mag\u0002netic response by changing the geometry of the cut wire\r
and the separation between the cut wire and electric reso\u0002nator. By manipulating the magnetic coupling without\r
changing the ERR, we were able to decouple \u0001 and \u0002\r
and individually tune each resonance.\r
We performed computer simulations of an ideal—but\r
realizable—MM absorber using the commercial finite\u0002difference time domain (FDTD) solver Microwave Studio\r
by CST [17]. The program simulated a single unit cell as\r
shown in Fig. 1(c) with appropriate boundary conditions,\r
i.e., perfect electric (y^ z^ -plane) and perfect magnetic\r
(x^ z^ -plane). Waveguide ports on the other boundaries\r
simulated a TEM plane wave propagating through the\r
medium. Simulation produced the complex frequency de\u0002pendent S parameters, S~\r

respectively. From the S parameter data, we inverted the\r
Fresnel equations to extract the complex optical constants\r
[18]. We then examined the behavior of the surface current\r
density, magnetic and electric fields at !0 to verify that we\r
were coupling to the correct resonant mode of each MM\r
element. By tuning !0 of the \u0001 and \u0002 resonances (not\r
shown), due to the two MM elements, we achieved \u0001 \u0004 \u0002\r
and thus an impedance near the free space value. While\r
100% absorbance is theoretically possible, it can only\r
occur when the MM layer is impedance-matched to free\r
space such that R\u0001!\u0002 is zero [19]. One may then minimize\r
T\u0001!\u0002 such that the addition of multiple layers ensures\r
T\u0001!\u0002 ! 0. The simulated MM had the dimensions, in\r
millimeters, of: a1 \u0004 4:2, a2 \u0004 12, W \u0004 3:9, G \u0004 0:606,\r
t \u0004 0:6, L \u0004 1:7, H \u0004 11:8, and the MM elements were\r
separated by 0.65 in the z^ direction. In Fig. 2, we show the\r
simulation results for the MM PA. R\u0001!\u0002 and absorbance\r
[A\u0001!\u0002] are plotted from zero to 100% (left axis), and T\u0001!\u0002\r
is plotted on the right axis from zero to 5%. R\u0001!\u0002 is large\r
\u000697% near the bounds of the plot, 9 GHz and 14 GHz, but\r
there is a minimum of 0.01% at !0 \u0007 11:65 GHz.\r
Simulated T\u0001!\u0002 also undergoes a minimum near !0 and\r
yields a value of \u00060:9%. Thus, we achieve a best simulated\r
A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 1 \u0003 T\u0001!\u0002 \u0003 R\u0001!\u0002 slightly less than unity A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004\r
99% with a FWHM of 4% compared to !0.\r
While our simulated absorber achieves narrow-band\r
high A\u0001!\u0002, we were restricted by the minimum line widths\r
available to us (250 \u0002m) and other various fabrication\r
tolerances. These limitations were incorporated into the\r
design process, and we fabricated a MM which deviated\r
slightly from the ideal absorber and had the dimensions, in\r
millimeters, of: a1 \u0004 4:2, a2 \u0004 12, W \u0004 4, G \u0004 0:6, t \u0004\r
0:6, L \u0004 1:7, H \u0004 11:8. Each metallization was fabricated\r
on a FR4 substrate with a thickness of 0.2 mm. MMs were\r
fabricated using standard optical lithography. The substrate\r
consisted of a photosensitized FR-4 board with a 17 \u0002m\r
copper thickness. A mask was designed and printed in high\r
resolution on a transparency, and each MM component was\r
fabricated by standard optical lithography processes. These\r
boards were then sandwiched (using an adhesive with\r
0.06 mm thickness) about another 0.2 mm thick FR4 blank\r
substrate to obtain the correct spacing. The end results was\r
that the MM elements were separated by 0.72 mm in the z^\r
direction. This allowed us to couple to both magnetic and\r
electric resonances without out-of-plane elements typical\r
with ‘‘wine-crate’’ designs [2].\r
We experimentally verified the behavior of the absorber\r
by measuring the complex S parameters of a large planar\r
array of pixels (outer dimensions of 15 \b 15 cm). We used\r
a vector network analyzer that produced microwaves in the\r
range of 8–12 GHz. One microwave horn focused the GHz\r
beam on the sample, and another horn served as a detector.\r
Both horns coupled to linearly polarized light and had\r
parallel polarization directions. To measure T\u0001!\u0002, we set\r
the horns in a normal incidence confocal configuration. We\r
performed R\u0001!\u0002 measurements at normal incidence.\r
However, in order to eliminate large voltage standing\r
wave ratios (VSWR) which would overwhelm the data,\r
we used a beam splitter configuration, shown as the inset to\r
Fig. 3(a). Radiation first traveled from the transmitting\r
horn through the beam splitter, reflected from the sample\r
and returned to the beam splitter where it was reflected at\r
45% to the receiving horn. We set the normalization and\r
phase in T\u0001!\u0002 configuration by simply removing the sam\u0002ple. For reflection, we replaced the sample with a perfect\r
reflector for normalized measurements. Transmission tech\u0002niques have been described elsewhere [20].\r
Simulations were performed for this MM structure and\r
are presented for comparison to experimental data. R\u0001!\u0002 is\r
shown as the black (red online) line in Fig. 3(a). At low\r
frequencies, the reflectivity is high and yields values near\r
95%. A large feature occurs in R\u0001!\u0002 and has a minimum of\r
\u00063% near 11.5 GHz. Likewise, T\u0001!\u0002, shown as the black\r
(red online) line in Fig. 3(b), has 4% T\u0001!\u0002 at low frequen\u0002cies and then undergoes a minimum near 11.25 GHz. A\u0001!\u0002\r
of our MM unit cell thus has a maximum near where both\r
R\u0001!\u0002 and T\u0001!\u0002 have their minima. We plot A\u0001!\u0002 as the\r

Simulated A\u0001!\u0002 peaks at 96% at !0 \u0004 11:48 GHz and\r
has a FWHM of 4% with respect to !0.\r
By performing S parameter simulations, we are able to\r
account for the form of the experimental data. The mea\u0002sured R\u0001!\u0002 and T\u0001!\u0002 are plotted as the gray (blue online)\r
lines in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), respectively. We find excellent\r
agreement between simulated and measured T\u0001!\u0002 over all\r
frequencies characterized. The measured R\u0001!\u0002 is consis\u0002tently 8% lower than the simulated R\u0001!\u0002 at low frequen\u0002cies. Both the simulated and experimental R\u0001!\u0002 reach a\r
minimum at approximately 11.5 GHz, but experimentally,\r
the minimum is 11%, as opposed to the simulated value of\r
3%. There is also significant broadening in the experimen\u0002tal R\u0001!\u0002 line with respect to simulation. This is most likely\r
due to tolerances in the fabrication and assembly.\r
The experimental absorptivity A\u0001!\u0002 calculated from\r
T\u0001!\u0002 and R\u0001!\u0002 is shown as the gray (blue online) line in\r
Fig. 4. The simulated and experimental lines have maxi\u0002mum A\u0001!\u0002 at the same frequency, !max \u0004 11:5 GHz.\r
However, the simulated line reaches a maximum of 96%,\r
and the experimental line only reaches 88%, the difference\r
being primarily due to deviations in R\u0001!\u0002. Better fabrica\u0002tion and assembly tolerances will permit absorbances and\r
bandwidths similar to that shown as the black (red online)\r
line in Fig. 4. We performed simulations to verify the origin\r
of the broadening of A\u0001!\u0002. From a theoretical viewpoint, it\r
is expected that the frequency location of the A\u0001!\u0002 peak\r
depends significantly upon the separation between the\r
electric ring resonator and the cut wire, since this distance\r
determines the frequency location of the magnetic reso\u0002nance. Simulations verified this conjecture. We simulated\r
various spacings centered about the designed value of\r
0.72 mm, and computed a Gaussian weighted average\r
A\u0001!\u0002 with a standard deviation of \u0003 \u0004 20 \u0002m. The A\u0001!\u0002\r
calculated in this manner agrees very well with the experi\u0002mental line and is plotted as the gray dashed line in the\r
main panel of Fig. 4. Thus, assembly errors in the MM\r
spacing of only 5% can easily account for the disagreement\r
between the simulation and experiment shown in Fig. 4 as\r
the black and gray (red and blue online) lines, respectively.\r
An investigation into the effect of adding multiple MM\r
absorbing layers is shown in the main panel of Fig. 5. As\r
can be observed, A\u0001!\u0002 rises sharply with additional layers\r
and is asymptotic to unity, within computational noise.\r
Two layers of the MM absorber achieve a value of\r
\u000699:9972%. At this thickness, the entire MM is only\r
\u0006\u00040=2 at resonance. For the structure shown in Fig. 1,\r
A\u0001!0\u0002 can never reach unity since the MM is not perfectly\r
matched to free space. However, it is important to note that\r
although an impedance-matched structure may yield zero\r
R\u0001!0\u0002, this does not imply T\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 0. In this study, we are\r
interested in achieving R\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 T\u0001!0\u0002 \u0004 0 in a single unit\r
cell in the propagation direction. Thus, our MM structure\r
was optimized to maximize the A\u0001!\u0002 with the restriction of\r
minimizing the thickness. If this constraint is relaxed,\r
impedance matching is possible, and with multiple layers,\r
a perfect A\u0001!\u0002 can be achieved.\r
We further investigated the origin of the loss in our MM,\r
as indicated in the inset to Fig. 5. The Ohmic ‘‘surface’’\r
loss is mainly from the center conducting region of the\r
ERR, and dielectric losses occur in between the two MM\r
elements where the electric field is large. The major com\u0002ponent responsible for A\u0001!\u0002 in our MM structure is the\r
dielectric loss, and simulation indicates this is an order of\r
magnitude greater than Ohmic losses. This is consistent\r
with studies of frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) where it\r
was found that metallic absorption was relatively insignifi\u0002cant in comparison to dielectric losses [21].\r
We now discuss the potential application of a perfect\r
MM absorber as a bolometer. An ideal bolometric detector\r
is one in which all photons that fall upon its surface are\r
absorbed, converted to heat, and thus sensed [22]. A\r
prominent feature of commercially available bolometers\r
is their extreme bandwidth making them ideal candidates\r
as detectors, especially in the far infrared frequency regime\r
where other efficient detection methods are largely un\u0002available. However, bolometers which achieve a narrow\r
band response also have significant application as focal\r
plane array (FPA) detectors for imaging. The MM design\r
presented here achieves simulated absorbtivities near unity\r

reduces backscatter by 15 to 25 dB [24], but has sizes on\r
the order of \u0004, which is 35 times larger than our design at a\r
given center frequency. Some ferrites show reflection loss\r
of \u000330 dB [25]; however, they lack the inherent and\r
precise tunability of MMs. Other work on bolometric\r
frequency-selective materials require cryogenic tempera\u0002tures to operate and only achieve A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 50% [26]. At\r
optical, metal colloides are known to have large absorptive\r
properties [27] due to the geometric specific surface modes\r
[28]. This suggests an interesting possible application of\r
artificial plasmonic wire media [4] to function as PAs [16]\r
operating at microwave frequencies.\r
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MMs can be\r
highly absorptive over a narrow frequency range. This\r
stems from the ability to design MM elements which can\r
individually absorb the electric and magnetic components\r
of an incident electromagnetic wave. In contrast, previous\r
experimental results at THz frequencies using a single type\r
of MM element (electric) yielded values of only A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004\r
\u000620% [29]. The resonant frequency of the MMs may be\r
tuned throughout some range of frequencies [30,31] thus\r
enabling hyperspectral imaging. A further benefit afforded\r
by MMs is the ability to construct a single unit cell with\r
\u0002\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 \u0001\u0001!\u0002 over an extended frequency range. Thus, this\r
unit cell can achieve zero R\u0001!\u0002 since it can have an\r
impedance equal to the free space value Z \u0004 \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002=\u0001 p \u0004 1.\r
This is similar to the well-known theoretical construct, the\r
Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) Absorbing Boundary\r
Condition (ABC) [32], which splits waves incident upon\r
a boundary into electric and magnetic components to ob\u0002tain near perfect absorption. The PML, however, requires\r
gain and additionally is on the order of \u00040=2 in thickness\r
[33].\r
The design presented here can still be improved. The\r
current design is polarization sensitive, which is not ideal\r
for some applications. By incorporating a substrate with a\r
highly consistent dielectric constant, we will be able to\r
optimize the design at the correct resonant frequency.\r
Similarly, tighter fabrication tolerances would allow us to\r
bring the impedance closer to unity and therefore closer to\r
A\u0001!\u0002 \u0004 1. Additionally, the assembly is complicated due\r
the restrictions placed on the direction of the incident wave\r
to couple to the magnetic resonator. This resulted in unit\r
cell variation and a less distinct A\u0001!\u0002 peak.\r
