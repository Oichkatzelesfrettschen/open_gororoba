Observation of gravitational waves from two neutron star–black hole coalescences\r
The LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and the KAGRA Collaboration\r
(Dated: June 30, 2021)\r
ABSTRACT\r
We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO’s\r
and Virgo’s third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star–black hole (NSBH)\r
binaries. The two events are named GW200105 162426 and GW200115 042309, abbreviated as\r
GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second\r
by all three LIGO–Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and\r
1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f and 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f (all\r
measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary’s mass is below\r
the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%–96% and 87%–98%, respectively, for GW200105 and\r
GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity\r
distances are 280+110\r
−110 Mpc and 300+150−100 Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of\r
GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For\r
GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at\r
88% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component\r
for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1 when assuming that\r
GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1 under\r
the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.\r
1. INTRODUCTION\r
In January 2020, the LIGO–Virgo detector net\u0002work observed gravitational-wave (GW) signals from\r
two compact binary inspirals which are consistent\r
with neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries. These\r
represent the first confident observations to date of\r
NSBH binaries via any observational means. The two\r
events, carrying the full designations GW200105 162426\r
and GW200115 042309, and abbreviated henceforth as\r
GW200105 and GW200115, were detected on January\r
05, 2020 at 16:24:26 UTC and January 15, 2020 at\r
04:23:10 UTC, respectively. The coincident detection\r
of GW200115 by the three detectors LIGO Hanford,\r
LIGO Livingston, and Virgo gives it high confidence\r
of being an astrophysical GW event. During the other\r
event, GW200105, the LIGO Hanford detector was not\r
operational and, owing to the small signal-to-noise ra\u0002tio (S/N) in Virgo, it was effectively a single-detector\r
event in LIGO Livingston. While quantification of the\r
confidence of single-detector events is subject to signifi\u0002cant uncertainty, GW200105 stands clearly apart in the\r
LIGO Livingston data from any other candidate with\r
NSBH-like parameters during the ∼11 months of the\r
third observing run (O3).\r
The component masses inferred from these binary in\u0002spirals provide information on the nature of their com\u0002ponents. The primaries have masses of m1 = 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f\r
and m1 = 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f, for GW200105 and GW200115,\r
respectively, with uncertainties quoted at the 90% cred\u0002ible level. These primary masses are well above the max\u0002imum mass of a neutron star (NS; Rhoades & Ruffini\r
1974; Abbott et al. 2018a; Shibata et al. 2019; Cromar\u0002tie et al. 2019; Farr & Chatziioannou 2020; Nathanail\r
et al. 2021; Fonseca et al. 2021) and within the mass\u0002range of black holes (BHs) observed electromagnetically\r
(Ozel et al. ¨ 2010; Farr et al. 2011; Kreidberg et al.\r
2012; Miller & Miller 2014) and via GWs (Abbott et al.\r
2016a, 2019a, 2021c). The masses of the secondaries are\r
m2 = 1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f and m2 = 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f, respectively, for\r
GW200105 and GW200115, within the mass range of\r
known NSs (Antoniadis et al. 2016; Alsing et al. 2018;\r
Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020a).\r
Detections of NSBHs have so far remained elusive in\r
both electromagnetic (EM) and GW surveys. In the\r
past four decades, surveys have identified 19 binary neu\u0002arXiv:2106.15163v1 [astro-ph.HE] 29 Jun 2021

2\r
tron star (BNS) systems in the Galaxy (Farrow et al.\r
2019; Agazie et al. 2021); however, the discovery of a\r
pulsar in an NSBH binary remains a key objective for\r
current and future radio observations (Liu et al. 2014;\r
Weltman et al. 2020).\r
Similarly, GW observations of LIGO and Virgo\r
through the first part of the O3 run (O3a) have led to\r
the identification of 48 binary black hole (BBH) candi\u0002dates (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2021c) and two BNS candi\u0002dates (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020c). Independent anal\u0002yses of the public detector data identified additional\r
GW candidates (Venumadhav et al. 2019, 2020; Za\u0002ckay et al. 2019a,b; Magee et al. 2019; Nitz et al. 2019,\r
2020b; Nitz et al. 2021). The absence of NSBH candi\u0002dates in LIGO and Virgo’s first and second observing\r
runs (O1 and O2, respectively) led to the upper limit\r
on the local merger rate density of NSBH systems of\r
RNSBH ≤ 610 Gpc−3 yr−1 at the 90% credible level (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2019a).\r
During O3a, two events were notable as possible\r
NSBH candidates. First, GW190426 152155 (Abbott\r
et al. 2021c) was identified as a marginal NSBH can\u0002didate with false alarm rate (1.4/yr) so high that it\r
could also plausibly be a detector noise artifact. Sec\u0002ond, GW190814 (Abbott et al. 2020d) may have been\r
an NSBH merger. Although GW190814’s secondary\r
mass of m2 = 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f likely exceeds the maxi\u0002mum mass supported by slowly spinning NSs (Essick\r
& Landry 2020; Fattoyev et al. 2020; Tews et al. 2021;\r
Godzieba et al. 2021), such as those found in known\r
binaries that will coalesce within a Hubble time, the\r
secondary could conceivably be an NS spinning near its\r
breakup frequency (Essick & Landry 2020; Tews et al.\r
2021; Most et al. 2020; Dexheimer et al. 2021).\r
The existence of NSBH systems has long been con\u0002jectured. Observations in the Milky Way reveal high\u0002mass X-ray binaries composed of a massive star and a\r
compact object (Liu et al. 2008; Orosz et al. 2009; Gou\r
et al. 2009; Orosz et al. 2011; Gou et al. 2014). Binary\r
evolution models show that X-ray binaries with a BH\r
component are possible progenitors of NSBH systems\r
(Belczynski et al. 2013; Grudzinska et al. 2015).\r
Major uncertainties regarding massive binary evolu\u0002tion, such as mass loss, mass transfer and the impact of\r
supernova explosions result in a wide range of merger\r
rate predictions: 0.1–800 Gpc−3 yr−1(Belczynski et al.\r
2002; Sipior & Sigurdsson 2002; Belczynski et al. 2006;\r
Dominik et al. 2015; Belczynski et al. 2016; Eldridge\r
et al. 2017; Mapelli & Giacobbo 2018; Kruckow et al.\r
2018; Neijssel et al. 2019; Drozda et al. 2020; Zevin\r
et al. 2020; Broekgaarden et al. 2021). Comparable\r
NSBH merger rates are predicted from young star clus\u0002ters (Ziosi et al. 2014; Rastello et al. 2020) while NSBH\r
merger rates in globular and nuclear clusters are pre\u0002dicted to be orders of magnitude lower (Clausen et al.\r
2013; Ye et al. 2020; Fragione & Banerjee 2020; Hoang\r
et al. 2020; Arca Sedda 2020). Measuring the NSBH\r
merger rate and properties such as masses and spins is\r
crucial in determining formation channels.\r
This letter presents the status of the detectors dur\u0002ing times around GW200105 and GW200115 (§2), and\r
the results of the different searches leading to the de\u0002tections (§3). We describe the main properties of the\r
two events (§4) and discuss the nature of the secondary\r
components (§5). Finally, we present the astrophysical\r
implications, including merger rates of this new class of\r
GW source (§6) and conclude (§7). Data products asso\u0002ciated with the events reported here, such as calibrated\r
strain time series and parameter estimation posterior\r
samples, are available through the Gravitational Wave\r
Open Science Center (GWOSC) at gw-openscience.org.\r
2. DETECTORS AND DATA\r
The two events reported here were observed in the sec\u0002ond part of the third observing run (O3b). At the time\r
of GW200105, LIGO Livingston had been in a stable op\u0002erational state for over 10 hrs, with a sensitivity, quan\u0002tified by the angle-averaged BNS inspiral range (Allen\r
et al. 2012), of ∼137 Mpc. Virgo had been in its nom\u0002inal state for ∼22 hrs, with a BNS range of ∼45 Mpc,\r
and LIGO Hanford was not operational. At the time\r
of GW200115, all three interferometers had been in a\r
stable operational state for over 2 hrs. The BNS ranges\r
for LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo around\r
the detection were ∼115 Mpc, ∼133 Mpc, and ∼50 Mpc,\r
respectively.\r
Figure 1 shows time–frequency representations (Chat\u0002terji et al. 2004) of the two events. The LIGO Livingston\r
data of GW200105 show a track of excess power with\r
increasing frequency. For GW200115, no similar tracks\r
are visible, as the S/N in each of the detectors is lower\r
than that of GW200105 in LIGO Livingston (see Fig. 3).\r
Also, light-scattering noise (Soni et al. 2020; Soni et al.\r
2021) is visible in Fig. 1 in LIGO Livingston around\r
20 Hz.\r
The LIGO and Virgo GW detectors are calibrated us\u0002ing radiation pressure from auxiliary lasers at a known\r
frequency and amplitude (Acernese et al. 2018; Sun et al.\r
2020). In LIGO, the calibration pipeline (Viets et al.\r
2018) linearly subtracts the noise from the calibration\r
lines and the harmonics of the power mains from the\r
data.\r

Times are shown relative to the signals’ merger times, January 05, 2020 at 16:24:26 UTC (left) and January 15, 2020 at 04:23:10\r
UTC (right). The amplitude scale of each time–frequency tile is normalized by the respective detector’s noise amplitude spectral\r
density. The LIGO Livingston data of GW200105 show a track of excess power with increasing frequency. In the other panels, no\r
similar tracks are visible, as the S/N in each of the detectors is lower and (for GW200115) the signal is longer. For GW200105,\r
the LIGO Livingston data are shown after glitch subtraction. For GW200115, light-scattering noise is visible in LIGO Livingston\r
below 25 Hz.\r
are for the LIGO detectors no larger than 8.6% in am\u0002plitude and 5.9\r
◦\r
in phase for GW200105 and 8.0% in\r
amplitude and 5.5\r
◦\r
in phase for GW200115 (68% cred\u0002ible intervals). For Virgo, we use 5.0% in amplitude\r
and 4.1\r
◦\r
in phase for both events, except for frequen\u0002cies 46–51 Hz, where additional calibration systematic\r
error arises from online loops set up to damp the main\r
power lines at 50 Hz and mechanical resonances of the\r
suspensions close to 48 Hz. This effect was introduced\r
during detector improvements carried out between O3a\r
and O3b and is not accounted for in the signal recon\u0002struction process. However, Virgo data in the frequency\r
window 46–51 Hz are excluded from the parameter esti\u0002mation analyses in §4.\r
To verify that instrumental noise artifacts do not bias\r
the analysis of source properties of the observed events,\r
we use data quality validation procedures as in previ\u0002ous events (Abbott et al. 2016b; Davis et al. 2021), em\u0002ploying sensor arrays at LIGO and Virgo to measure\r
environmental disturbances that could couple into the\r
interferometers (Nguyen et al. 2021). In Virgo, we find\r
no evidence of excess power from terrestrial sources for\r
both events. For GW200105, we identify light-scattering\r
noise in LIGO Livingston below 25 Hz, 3 s before merger.\r
As in past detections (Abbott et al. 2021c), we sub\u0002tract this noise with the BayesWave algorithm (Cornish\r
et al. 2021) and use the cleaned data for the source pa\u0002rameter estimation in §4. The top left panel of Fig. 1\r
shows the cleaned data. A low-energy feature around\r
20 Hz, not overlapping with the time–frequency track\r
of GW200105, remains after the glitch subtraction. For\r
GW200115, we also identify light scattering in the LIGO\r
Livingston data below 25 Hz. Due to the increased dif\u0002ficulty of subtracting the long-duration glitching that\r
coincides with the time–frequency track of GW200115,\r
glitch-subtracted data were not available at the time of\r
analysis. Hence, we exclude LIGO Livingston data be\u0002low 25 Hz in the analysis in §4.

3. DETECTIONS\r
GW200115 is a coincident event, and in §3.1 we de\u0002scribe the established procedures to identify it and\r
determine its significance. Subsequently, we describe\r
the procedures followed for the single-detector event\r
GW200105.\r
3.1. GW200115 – Multi-detector event\r
GW200115 was initially identified by all four low\u0002latency matched-filtering pipelines as a possible com\u0002pact binary coalescence (CBC) candidate in LIGO Han\u0002ford and LIGO Livingston: GstLAL (Cannon et al.\r
2012; Privitera et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev\r
et al. 2019; Hanna et al. 2020), MBTAOnline (Aubin\r
et al. 2021; Adams et al. 2016), PyCBC Live (Dal Can\u0002ton et al. 2020; Nitz et al. 2018, 2019, 2017; Usman\r
et al. 2016), and SPIIR (Luan et al. 2012; Hooper et al.\r
2012; Chu et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2018). As detailed\r
in Abbott et al. (2021c), matched-filtering searches use\r
banks (Owen & Sathyaprakash 1999; Harry et al. 2009;\r
Privitera et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2017, 2019) of modeled\r
gravitational waveforms, with the mass range relevant\r
to GW200105 and GW200115 covered by the SEOB\u0002Table 1. Network S/N recovered by the search pipelines\r
in low-latency and in later offline analysis with improved\r
calibration and refined data-quality information. An asterisk\r

NRv4 ROM waveform model (Boh´e et al. 2017; P¨urrer\r
2016). The signal in Virgo was not loud enough to fur\u0002ther improve the significance of the coincident candidate\r
observed by the LIGO detectors, so GW200115 was re\u0002ported as a two-detector event in the GraceDB event\r
database named S200115j with a merger time of January\r
15, 2020 at 04:23:10 UTC.\r
A public Preliminary Gamma-ray burst Coordinates\r
Network (GCN) Notice was sent out six minutes af\u0002ter the event (LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo\r
Collaboration 2020a). The low-latency BAYESTAR\r
(Singer & Price 2016) sky map computed from the orig\u0002inal trigger, which was produced from MBTAOnline,\r
indicated a possible discrepancy compared to those from\r
the other three pipelines. Therefore, the representative\r
trigger was manually switched to the one from GstLAL\r
(LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration\r
2020b). The associated sky map is shown in the bottom\r
panel of Fig. 2 with a solid black line with 90% credible\r
area of 900 deg2. The GCN Circular reported a prob\u0002ability > 99% for the lighter compact object to have a\r
mass below 3M\f, derived from a machine-learning anal\u0002ysis (Kapadia et al. 2020; Chatterjee et al. 2020). The\r
RAVEN pipeline (Urban 2016), which looks for coinci\u0002dent gamma ray bursts (GRBs), did not report an asso\u0002ciated GRB trigger from Fermi-GBM or the Neil Gehrels\r
Swift Observatory within −1 s and +5 s of the GW trig\u0002ger. A total of 31 GCN Circulars (GCN archive for\r
S200115j 2020) reporting follow-up observations were\r
published for this event. To date, no EM counterpart\r
has been reported associated with GW200115.\r
After the low-latency identification of GW200115, the\r
extended periods of strain data around the event are\r
further analyzed by the detection pipelines in their of\u0002fline configurations using improved calibration and re\u0002fined data quality information that is not available in low\r
latency (Abbott et al. 2018b, 2021c; Davis et al. 2021).\r
In this analysis, we also subtract nonstationary noise\r
due to the nonlinear coupling of the 60 Hz power mains

5\r
at the LIGO detectors using coupling functions derived\r
from machine-learning techniques (Vajente et al. 2020).\r
PyCBC uses a template bank constructed with a\r
hybrid geometric-random algorithm (Roy et al. 2019,\r
2017), while GstLAL and MBTA use a template bank\r
generated by a stochastic placement method (Mukher\u0002jee et al. 2021; Babak 2008; Privitera et al. 2014). Gst\u0002LAL identifies GW200115 with a network S/N of 11.6\r
and FAR of <1/(1×105 yr) using the data from Novem\u0002ber 1, 2019 15:00 UTC to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC.\r
The MBTA and PyCBC offline analyses also identified\r
the trigger in data from January 13, 2020 10:27 UTC\r
to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC, yielding consistent net\u0002work S/Ns as shown in Table 1, as well as estimated\r
FARs of 1/(182 yr) and <1/(5.6 × 104 yr), respectively.\r
Based on two detectors, these FARs robustly indicate\r
the confidence of the detection.\r
3.2. GW200105 – Single-detector event\r
GW200105 was identified by GstLAL running in the\r
low-latency configuration as a possible CBC candidate\r
in LIGO Livingston and Virgo data with network S/N of\r
13.9 and merger time January 05, 2020 at 16:24:26 UTC.\r
The candidate identified as S200105ae in GraceDB was\r
considered a single-detector event because the S/N in\r
Virgo was below the threshold S/N of 4.0.\r
The low-latency FAR of ≈ 24 per year did not pass\r
the threshold for sending a GCN alert. Without the\r
information provided by temporal coincidence between\r
different detectors and consistency in recovered param\u0002eters, it is more difficult to obtain a robust estimate\r
of the event’s significance. In fact, an alternative con\u0002figuration of GstLAL, running to test several improve\u0002ments made in the offline configuration of early O3 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2021c), found the trigger at higher signifi\u0002cance. Therefore, validation procedures and subsequent\r
early-offline analysis were initiated. The three other low\u0002latency search pipelines, MBTAOnline, PyCBC Live,\r
and SPIIR, also generated triggers with consistent S/Ns\r
near the event time of S200105ae (see Table 1). These\r
three pipelines were not configured to assign FARs to\r
single-detector triggers and therefore did not generate\r
automatic alerts for GW200105.\r
On January 6, 2020 at 19:39:09 UTC, the initial GCN\r
Circular reported a low-latency BAYESTAR skymap\r
(solid black contours) in the top panel of Fig. 2 with 90%\r
credible region of 7700 deg2 and a 12% chance of for\u0002mation of tidally disrupted matter—relevant for a pos\u0002sible EM counterpart—as a result of the coalescence,\r
as derived from a machine-learning analysis (Kapadia\r
et al. 2020; Chatterjee et al. 2020). Using the param\u0002eters obtained from low-latency parameter estimation,\r
Figure 3. Colored shading shows the joint S/N–ξ\r
2\r
noise probability density function for LIGO Hanford (LHO),\r
LIGO Livingston (LLO), and Virgo, computed from back\u0002ground triggers found by GstLAL in the region of lighter\r
binary systems during the entire O3. The red star indicates\r
GW200105. At its position, there is no background present,\r
indicating that it stands above all of the recorded background\r
triggers. For comparison, the triggers of GW200115 and the\r
marginal GW190426 152155 are also shown.\r
the chance of formation of tidally disrupted material\r
was later revised to be negligible (see LIGO Scientific\r
Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration 2020c and §5 be\u0002low).\r
In response to the discovery notice of GW200105, mul\u0002tiple observatories carried out follow-up and shared their\r
results publicly via 21 GCN circulars (GCN archive for\r
S200105ae 2020). To date, no EM counterpart has been\r
reported associated with GW200105.\r
After the event’s identification in low latency, the\r
strain data are further analyzed by the detection\r
pipelines in their offline configuration, following pro\u0002cedures for single-detector events discussed in Abbott\r
et al. (2020a). GstLAL identifies GW200105 with an\r
S/NR of 13.9 and FAR of 1/(2.8 yr) in its offline config\u0002uration using data from November 1, 2019 15:00 UTC\r
up to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC. For single-detector\r
events, like GW200105, the FAR estimate involves ex\u0002trapolation, as explained below. The MBTA and Py\u0002CBC offline analyses also identify the trigger in the\r
LIGO Livingston data from January 4, 2020 17:09 UTC\r
to January 13, 2020 10:27 UTC yielding the consistent\r
S/Ns shown in Table 1. The S/N for GW200105 is larger\r
than that for GW200115, even though LIGO Hanford\r
was not operational.\r
We cannot rely on only the S/N of the CBC trigger to\r
estimate its significance, i.e. to quantify how often detec\u0002tor noise mimics a possible coalescence signal. Because\r
detector noise shows significant deviation in the tails\r
from the standard Gaussianity assumptions, its prop-

6\r
erties have to be estimated empirically (Abbott et al.\r
2016c). For multi-detector triggers like GW200115, con\u0002sistency of the observed CBC trigger among two or more\r
detectors forms an integral part of establishing it as\r
a confident detection with a low FAR. On the other\r
hand, single-detector triggers can be assigned only mod\u0002est FAR values due to limited detector observational\r
time (Callister et al. 2017; Nitz et al. 2020a). Nonethe\u0002less, alternative methods can be used to estimate con\u0002fidence in a single-detector event, as was demonstrated\r
for GW190425 (Abbott et al. 2020a).\r
The signal GW200105 measured in LIGO Livingston\r
is distinct from all noise events in the entire O3 obser\u0002vation period. Specifically, Fig. 3 shows with colored\r
shading the distribution of background noise triggers\r
identified by GstLAL in the region of binary systems\r
with a chirp mass less than 4 M\f. The colored region\r
indicates the density of background noise triggers quan\u0002tified through the S/N–ξ\r
2 noise probability density func\u0002tion for the three detectors, where the autocorrelation ξ\r
2\r
provides a consistency test similar to χ\r
2\r
(Messick et al.\r
2017). The red star represents GW200105, which lies in\r
a region of this plane without noise triggers, indicating\r
that this trigger is unique within the entire O3.\r
For comparison, Fig. 3 also shows GW200115 and\r
the marginal candidate GW190426 152155 separately\r
for LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford. In general,\r
triggers such as GW200115 and GW190426 152155 in\r
Fig. 3 would not be separable from the noise by a single\r
detector alone, and it is the coincidence between multi\u0002ple detectors that raises their significance. On the other\r
hand, the coincidence was not available for GW200105,\r
yet it clearly stands out from the background in Fig. 3\r
as strong GW signals typically do.\r
The uniqueness of GW200105 within the data shown\r
leads to a upper bound on the FAR assignment compa\u0002rable to the inverse observing time. A stronger bound,\r
like the FAR quoted above, must rely on assumptions\r
made on the properties of the noise triggers if one had\r
collected the observational strain data for a longer pe\u0002riod, a process called extrapolation. As a consequence of\r
the assumptions made, the extrapolated FAR estimates\r
have large uncertainties. Since single-detector FAR es\u0002timates rely on the uniqueness within the dataset, the\r
values may change and errors may reduce as more data\r
are accumulated. At the time of the analysis, nei\u0002ther MBTA nor PyCBC had the capability to as\u0002sign a significance to single-detector triggers, although\r
GW200105 also stands out as a unique trigger in their\r
analyses. Based on these considerations, we consider\r
this trigger to be astrophysical and include it in the\r
analysis in the remainder of this paper.\r
4. SOURCE PROPERTIES\r
We infer the physical properties of the two GW\r
events using a coherent Bayesian analysis following the\r
methodology described in Appendix B of Abbott et al.\r
(2019a). For GW200105, data from LIGO Livingston\r
and Virgo are analyzed, whereas for GW200115, data\r
from both LIGO detectors and Virgo are used.\r
Owing to the different signal durations, we analyze\r
32 s of data for the higher-mass event GW200105 and\r
64 s of data for GW200115. All likelihood evaluations\r
use a low-frequency cutoff of flow = 20 Hz, except for\r
LIGO Livingston for GW200115, where flow = 25 Hz\r
avoids excess noise localized at low frequencies, as dis\u0002cussed in §2. The power spectral density used in the\r
likelihood calculations is the median estimate calculated\r
with BayesLine (Cornish & Littenberg 2015).\r
The parallel Bilby (pbilby) inference library, together\r
with the dynesty nested sampling software (Ashton\r
et al. 2019; Romero-Shaw et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2020;\r
Speagle 2020) is the primary tool used to sample the\r
posterior distribution of the sources’ parameters and\r
perform hypothesis testing. In addition, we use RIFT\r
(Lange et al. 2018) for the most computationally expen\u0002sive analyses and LALInference (Veitch et al. 2015)\r
for verification.\r
We base our main analyses of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 on BBH waveform models that include the\r
effects of spin-induced orbital precession and higher\u0002order multipole GW moments, but do not include tidal\r
effects on the secondary. Specifically, we use two sig\u0002nal models: IMRPhenomXPHM (Phenom PHM; Prat\u0002ten et al. 2020) from the phenomenological family and\r
SEOBNRv4PHM (EOBNR PHM; Ossokine et al. 2020)\r
from the effective one-body numerical relativity family.\r
The acronym PHM stands for Precessing Higher-order\r
multipole Moments. Henceforth, we will use the short\u0002ened names for the waveform models.\r
In order to quantify the impact of neglecting tidal ef\u0002fects, we also analyze GW200105 and GW200115 us\u0002ing two NSBH waveform models that include tidal ef\u0002fects and assume that spins are aligned with the or\u0002bital angular momentum: IMRPhenomNSBH (Phe\u0002nom NSBH; Thompson et al. 2020) and SEOB\u0002NRv4 ROM NRTidalv2 NSBH (EOBNR NSBH; Matas\r
et al. 2020). We restrict the NSBH analyses to the region\r
of applicability of the NSBH models, i.e. χ1 < 0.5, χ2 <\r
0.05 for Phenom NSBH and χ1 < 0.9, χ2 < 0.05 for\r
EOBNR NSBH. We also perform aligned-spin BBH\r
waveform analyses and find good agreement with the\r
analyses using NSBH waveform models (see §4.6 below),\r
validating the use of BBH waveform models. Specif\u0002ically, we use the aligned-spin BBH models IMRPhe-

(Phenom HM; Garc´ıa-Quir´os et al. 2020) and SEOB\u0002NRv4HM (EOBNR HM; Cotesta et al. 2018, 2020),\r
which contain higher-order moments.\r
The secondary objects are probably NSs based on\r
mass estimates, as discussed in detail in §5. As in ear\u0002lier GW analyses (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020a), we pro\u0002ceed with two different priors on the secondary’s spin\r
magnitude: a low-spin prior, χ2 ≤ 0.05, which captures\r
the maximum spin observed in Galactic BNSs that will\r
merge within a Hubble time (Burgay et al. 2003), and a\r
high-spin prior, χ2 ≤ 0.99, which is agnostic about the\r
nature of the compact object. The two priors allow us\r
to investigate whether the astrophysically relevant sub\u0002case of low NS spin leads to differences in the parameter\r
estimation for the binaries. All other priors are set as in\r
previous analyses (e.g., Abbott et al. 2021c). Through\u0002out, we assume a standard flat ΛCDM cosmology with\r
Hubble constant H0 = 67.9 km s−1 Mpc−1and matter\r
density parameter Ωm = 0.3065 (Ade et al. 2016).\r
For each spin prior, we run our main analyses with\r
higher-order multipole moments and precession for both\r
waveform families, EOBNR PHM and Phenom PHM.\r
The EOBNR PHM model is used in combination with\r
RIFT and the Phenom PHM model with pbilby. The\r
parameter estimation results for the individual precess\u0002ing waveform models yield results in very good agree\u0002ment; the median values typically differ by 1/10 of the\r
width of the 90% credible interval. Nevertheless, in or\u0002der to alleviate potential biases due to different sam\u0002plers or waveform models, we combine an equal num\u0002ber of samples of each into one data set for each spin\r
prior (Abbott et al. 2016d; Ashton & Khan 2020; Ab\u0002bott et al. 2020d) and denote these as Combined PHM.\r
The quoted parameter estimates in the following sec\u0002tions are the Combined PHM high-spin prior analyses.\r
In the figures, we emphasize the high-spin prior results.\r
The values of the most important parameters of the bi\u0002naries are summarized in Table 2, and we will present\r
details in the following sections.\r
4.1. Masses\r
Figure 4 shows the posterior distribution for the com\u0002ponent masses of the two binaries. Defining the mass\r
parameters such that the heavier mass is the primary\r
object, i.e. m1 > m2, our analysis shows that GW200105\r
is a binary with a mass ratio of q = m2/m1 = 0.22+0.08\r
−0.04,\r
with source component masses m1 = 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and\r
m2 = 1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f. Similarly, GW200115 is a binary with\r
a mass ratio of q = 0.26+0.35\r
−0.10, with source component\r
masses m1 = 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f and m2 = 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f.\r
The primary components of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 are identified as BHs from their mass mea\u0002surements. For GW200115, we find that the prob\u0002ability of the primary falling in the lower mass gap\r
(3 M\f . m1 . 5 M\f; Bailyn et al. 1998; Orosz et al.\r
1998) is 30% (27%) for high-spin (low-spin) prior.\r
For context, Fig. 4 also includes two potential NSBH\r
candidates discovered previously; GW190814 (Abbott\r
et al. 2020d) is a high-S/N event with well-measured\r
masses that has a significantly more massive primary\r
and a distinctly more massive secondary than either

and GW200115 (blue), represented by their two- and one\u0002dimensional posterior distributions. Colored shading and\r
solid curves indicate the high-spin prior, whereas dashed\r
curves represent the low-spin prior. The contours in the main\r
panel, as well as the vertical and horizontal lines in the top\r
and right panels, respectively, indicate the 90% credible in\u0002tervals. Also shown in gray are two possible NSBH events,\r
GW190814 and the marginal candidate GW190426 152155,\r
the latter overlapping GW200115. Lines of constant mass\r
ratio are indicated in dashed gray. The green shaded curves\r
in the right panel represent the one-dimensional probability\r
densities for two estimates of the maximum NS mass, based\r
on analyses of nonrotating NSs (Mmax,TOV; Landry et al.\r
2020, 2021) and Galactic NSs (Mmax,GNS; Farr & Chatzi\u0002ioannou 2020).\r
GW200105 or GW200115, and the marginal candidate\r
GW190426 152155 (Abbott et al. 2021c), has (if of as\u0002trophysical origin) m1–m2 contours that overlap those\r
of GW200115. The masses of GW190426 152155 are\r
less constrained than those of GW200115 due to its\r
smaller S/N. To highlight how the secondary masses of\r
GW200105 and GW200115 compare to the maximum\r
NS mass, we also show two estimates of the maximum\r
NS mass based on an analyses of non-rotating (Landry\r
et al. 2020) and Galactic (Farr & Chatziioannou 2020)\r
NSs.\r
The secondary masses are consistent with the maxi\u0002mum NS mass, which we quantify in §5.2.\r
4.2. Sky location, distance, and inclination\r
We localize GW200105’s source to a sky area of\r
7200 deg2(90% credible region). The large sky area\r
arises due to the absence of data from LIGO Hanford.\r
Figure 5. Two- and one-dimensional posterior distributions\r
for distance DL and inclinaton θJN . The solid (dashed) lines\r
indicate the high-spin (low-spin) prior analysis, and the shad\u0002ing indicates the posterior probability of the high-spin prior\r
analysis. The contours in the main panel and the horizontal\r
lines in the right panel indicate 90% credible intervals.\r
The luminosity distance of the source is found to be\r
DL = 280+110\r
−110 Mpc. For the second event, GW200115,\r
we localize its source to be within 600 deg2. It is bet\u0002ter localized than GW200105 by an order of magni\u0002tude, since GW200115 was observed with three detec\u0002tors. We find the luminosity distance of the source to\r
be DL = 300+150\r
−100 Mpc.\r
The luminosity distance is degenerate with the incli\u0002nation angle θJN between the line of sight and the bina\u0002ries’ total angular momentum vector (Cutler & Flana\u0002gan 1994; Nissanke et al. 2010). Inclination θJN = 0\r
indicates that the angular momentum vector points to\u0002ward Earth. The posterior distribution of the inclination\r
angle is bimodal and strongly correlated with luminos\u0002ity distance, as shown in Figure 5. The inclination mea\u0002surement for GW200105 equally favors orbits that are\r
either oriented toward or away from the line of sight.\r
In contrast, GW200115 shows modest preference for an\r
orientation θJN ≤ π/2.\r
4.3. Spins\r
The angular momentum vector S~\r
i of each compact\r
object is related to its dimensionless spin vector ~χi ≡\r
cS~\r
i/(Gm2\r
i\r
). Its magnitude χi ≡ |~χi| is bounded by 1.\r
For GW200105, we infer χ1 = 0.08+0.22\r
−0.08, which is con\u0002sistent with zero. For GW200115, the spin magnitude\r
is not as tightly constrained, χ1 = 0.33+0.48\r
−0.29, but is also

Figure 6. Two-dimensional posterior probability for the spin-tilt angle and spin magnitude for the primary objects\r
(left hemispheres) and secondary objects (right hemispheres) for both events. Spin-tilt angles of 0° (180°) correspond to\r
spins aligned (antialigned) with the orbital anglular momentum. The color indicates the posterior probability per pixel of\r
the high-spin prior analysis. For comparison with the low-spin analysis, the solid (dashed) lines indicate the 90% credible\r
regions of the high-spin (low-spin) prior analyses. The tiles are constructed linearly in spin magnitude and the cosine of the\r
tilt angles such that each tile contains an identical prior probability. The probabilities are marginalized over the azimuthal angles.\r
consistent with zero. The spin of the secondary for both\r
events is unconstrained.\r
One of the best-constrained spin parameters is the\r
effective inspiral spin parameter χeff (Damour 2001;\r
Racine 2008; Santamar´ıa et al. 2010; Ajith et al. 2014;\r
Vitale et al. 2017a). It encodes information about the\r
binaries’ spin components parallel to the orbital angular\r
momentum, χeff =\r
 m1\r
M ~χ1 +\r
m2\r
M ~χ2\r
\u0001\r
· Lˆ, where Lˆ is the\r
unit vector along the orbital angular momentum.\r
For GW200105, χeff = −0.01+0.11\r
−0.15 and we find the ef\u0002fective inspiral spin parameter to be strongly peaked\r
about zero, with roughly equal support for being ei\u0002ther positive or negative. For GW200115, we find mod\u0002est support for negative effective inspiral spin: χeff =\r
−0.19+0.23\r
−0.35. Negative values of χeff indicate binaries\r
with at least one spin component negatively aligned\r
with respect to the orbital angular momentum, i.e.\r
χi,z ≡ ~χi· L < ˆ 0. We find χ1,z = −0.19+0.24\r
−0.50, and a\r
probability of 88% that χ1,z < 0.\r
The joint posterior probability of the dimensionless\r
spin angular momentum magnitude and tilt angle for\r
both components of both events is shown in Fig. 6. The\r
tilt angle with respect to the orbital angular momentum\r
is defined as arccos \r
L. ˆ χˆi\r
\u0001\r
. Deviations from uniform\r
shading indicate a spin orientation measurement. The\r
spin orientation of the primary of GW200105 is uncon\u0002strained, whereas the orientation of GW200115 shows\r
support for negatively aligned primary spin.\r
Orbital precession is caused by a spin component in\r
the orbital plane of a binary (Apostolatos et al. 1994),\r
which we parameterize using the effective precession spin\r
parameter 0 ≤ χp ≤ 1 (Schmidt et al. 2015). We infer\r
χp = 0.09+0.14\r
−0.07 for GW200105 and χp = 0.21+0.30−0.17 for\r
GW200115. To assess the significance of a measurement\r
of precession, we compute a Bayes factor between a pre\u0002cessing and nonprecessing signal model and the preces\u0002sion S/N ρp (Fairhurst et al. 2020a,b). For GW200105,\r
we find a log Bayes factor in favor of spin precession of\r
log10 B = −0.24 and precession S/N ρp = 0.74+1.35\r
−0.61. For\r
GW200115, log10 B = −0.12 and ρp = 0.97+1.57\r
−0.79. For\r
both events and both diagnostics, this indicates incon\u0002clusive evidence of precession. This result is expected\r
given the S/Ns and inferred inclination angles of the\r
binaries (Vitale et al. 2014; Green et al. 2021; Pratten\r
et al. 2020b).\r
Low values of the primary mass of GW200115 (m1 .\r
5 M\f) are strongly correlated with negative values of\r
the primary parallel spin component χ1,z, as shown in\r
Fig. 7. The astrophysical implications of the mass and\r
spin correlation are discussed in §6. Figure 7 also shows\r
the in-plane spin component χ⊥, which is peaked about\r
zero. The lack of conclusive evidence for spin precession\r
in GW200115 is consistent with the measurement of χ⊥.\r

the primary spin in Fig. 6 and the posteriors of χ1⊥–χ1,z

GW200115. The corner plot shows the one-dimensional (di\u0002agonal) and two-dimensional (off-diagonal) marginal poste\u0002rior distributions for the primary’s mass and perpendicular\r
and parallel spin components. The shading indicates the\r
posterior probability of the high-spin prior analysis. The\r
solid (dashed) lines indicate the 50% and 90% credible re\u0002gions of the high-spin (low-spin) prior analyses. The vertical\r
lines indicate the 90% credible intervals for the analyses with\r
high-spin (solid lines) and low-spin (dashed lines) prior.\r
in Fig. 7 arise from different choices in visualizing the\r
spin orientation posteriors.\r
4.4. Remnant properties\r
Under the hypothesis of NSBH coalescence for the\r
two events, estimates for the final mass and final spin\r
of the remnant BH can be made using the models of\r
Zappa et al. (2019). We use samples obtained by com\u0002bining those from Phenom NSBH and EOB NSBH.\r
For GW200105, the remnant mass and spin are Mf =\r
10.4\r
+2.7\r
−2.0\r
and χf = 0.43+0.04\r
−0.03, while for GW200115, Mf =\r
7.8\r
+1.4\r
−1.6\r
and χf = 0.38+0.04\r
−0.02. We do not investigate any\r
post-merger GW signals. The S/Ns of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 are around a factor of 3 less than that of\r
GW170817, for which there was no evidence of GWs af\u0002ter the merger (Abbott et al. 2017b). In the absence of\r
tidal disruption, the postmerger signals of GW200105\r
and GW200115 would likely resemble a BH ringdown\r
(Foucart et al. 2013). The GW signal associated with\r
such ringdowns would appear well outside of LIGO’s and\r
Virgo’s sensitive bandwidth given the remnant masses\r
and spins of the systems (Sarin & Lasky 2021).\r

show that GW200105 and GW200115 have too low an\r
S/N to allow for tighter constraints than those already\r
presented in Abbott et al. (2021d). Within their mea\u0002surement uncertainties, our results do not show statis\u0002tically significant evidence for deviations from the pre\u0002diction of GR.\r
To quantify the evidence for higher-order GW multi\u0002pole moments, we calculate the orthogonal optimal S/N\r
ρ\r
⊥\r
lm for the subdominant multipole moments (Abbott\r
et al. 2020c,d; Mills & Fairhurst 2021). We find the\r
(`, |m|) = (3, 3) to be the loudest subdominant multi\u0002pole moment, as expected for binaries with asymmet\u0002ric masses. Using the Phenom HM waveform model,\r
we infer ρ\r
⊥\r
33 = 1.70+0.92\r
−1.09 (1.70+0.94−1.11) for GW200105 and\r
ρ\r
⊥\r
33 = 0.91+0.93\r
−0.66 (0.86+0.90−0.65) for GW200115 with the low\r
(high) spin prior. In Gaussian noise, the median of ρ\r
⊥\r
33 is\r
approximately chi-distributed with two degrees of free\u0002dom, and values greater than 2.1 indicate significant\r
higher-order multipole content. The measured ρ\r
⊥\r
33 are\r
therefore consistent with Gaussian noise, as expected for\r
the majority of NSBHs at these S/Ns, except for those\r
viewed close to edge-on.\r
4.6. Waveform systematics\r
Our primary results are obtained using precessing\r
BBH models with higher-order multipole moments, Phe\u0002nom PHM and EOBNR PHM. We now justify this\r
choice by investigating potential systematic uncertain\u0002ties due to our waveform choice.\r
First, we investigate the agreement between inde\u0002pendent waveform models that incorporate identical\r
physics. Figure 8 shows the two-dimensional m2–χeff\r
posteriors for both events obtained using a variety of\r
NSBH and aligned-spin BBH models. Because some\r
NSBH models only cover χ1 < 0.5, we restrict the prior\r
range of all models to χ1 < 0.5 for consistency.\r
The main panels of Fig. 8 are dominated by a corre\u0002lation of the effective inspiral spin parameter χeff with\r
the secondary mass m2 (Cutler & Flanagan 1994; Ng\r
et al. 2018a). Both NSBH models (Phenom NSBH and\r
EOBNR NSBH) give consistent results with each other,\r
as do both BBH models (Phenom and EOBNR), both\r
with and without higher-order multipole moments, with\r
the most notable difference being that EOBNR HM\r
yields tighter posteriors than Phenom HM. This demon\u0002strates that waveform models including the same physics

Figure 8. Comparison of two-dimensional m2–χeff posteriors for the two events reported here, using various NSBH and BBH\r
signal models. The vertical dashed lines indicate several mass-ratio references mapped to m2 for the median estimate of the\r
chirp masses of GW200105 and GW200115.\r
give comparable results, but more studies are warranted\r
to improve the understanding of the BBH waveform\r
models in the NSBH region of parameter space. While\r
not shown in Fig. 8, we also find good agreement be\u0002tween the primary precessing BBH waveform models;\r
see §4.\r
Second, comparing the NSBH models with the BBH\r
models without higher-order multipole moments (Phe\u0002nom and EOBNR), the NSBH models recover similar\r
posterior contours in the m2–χeff plane. This is ex\u0002pected given the asymmetric mass ratio and low S/N of\r
these NSBH observations; see, e.g. Huang et al. (2021)\r
for a demonstration that higher S/Ns would be needed\r
to see notable systematic effects. We observe differences\r
at the extreme ends of the m2–χeff contours (i.e. at the\r
smallest and largest values of m2). The construction\r
of the NSBH waveform models used here did not rely\r
on numerical relativity results at mass ratios q . 1/8,\r
nor did they include simulations with χ1z < 0 or NS\r
masses m2 > 1.4M\f (Matas et al. 2020; Thompson\r
et al. 2020). Therefore, some differences should be ex\u0002pected, especially for large m2 in GW200105. Further\u0002more, for GW200105, the tails of the m2–χeff distribu\u0002tion for Phenom NSBH and EOB NSBH at high m2 are\r
also impacted by the inability of the data to constrain\r
the tidal deformability. Hence, the posterior samples\r
include combinations of high m2 with large Λ2, despite\r
such combinations being unphysical. This effect is not\r
apparent for GW200115 because of its smaller secondary\r
mass. The isolated islands of probability in the extreme\r
tails of the distributions are due to sampling noise.\r
Last, when adding the extra physical content\r
of higher-order multipole moments in BBH models\r
(through Phenom HM and EOBNR HM), the extreme\r
ends of the m2–χeff contours are excluded, while the\r
bulk of the distributions are consistent with the posteri\u0002ors obtained with the NSBH models. In summary, these\r
comparisons indicate that (i) waveform models includ\u0002ing the same physics give comparable results; (ii) going\r
from NSBH models to comparable BBH models changes\r
the results only marginally, i.e. any effects of tides are\r
small; and (iii) inclusion of higher-order multipole mo\u0002ments changes the posterior contours more substantially\r
than inclusion of tides. We conclude that the the inclu\u0002sion of precession and higher-order multipole moments\r
afforded by the BBH waveform models is more impor\u0002tant than the impact of tides in the NSBH models.\r
5. NATURE OF THE SECONDARY COMPONENTS\r
In this section, we describe the investigations to es\u0002tablish the nature of the secondary objects. In §5.1, we\r
look for imprints of tidal deformations of the secondaries\r
and conclude that the masses, spins, distances and S/Ns\r
of the detections make definitive identifications of NSs\r
unlikely, both in GW and EM measurements. However,\r
in §5.2, we show that the posterior distributions of the\r
secondary masses agree with those of known NSs.

12\r
5.1. Tidal deformability and tidal disruption\r
The tidal deformability of NSs is imprinted in the GW\r
signal, and is investigated using the parameter estima\u0002tion techniques of §4. In contrast, BHs have zero tidal\r
deformability (Binnington & Poisson 2009; Damour &\r
Nagar 2009; Chia 2020; Charalambous et al. 2021; Le\r
Tiec & Casals 2021). We infer the tidal deformabil\u0002ity Λ2 of the NSs in GW200105 and GW200115 using\r
the NSBH waveform models that include tides. We find\r
that the tidal deformabilities are uninformative relative\r
to a uniform prior in Λ2 ∈ [0, 5000]. This measurement\r
cannot establish the presence of NSs, which is expected\r
given the mass ratios and the S/N of the detections (Fou\u0002cart et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2017; Fasano et al. 2020;\r
Huang et al. 2020).\r
Toward the end of the inspiral, the BH may tidally\r
disrupt the NS and form an accretion disk (Pannar\u0002ale 2013; Foucart et al. 2018). This is hypothesized to\r
drive a relativistic jet (Pannarale et al. 2011; Pascha\u0002lidis et al. 2015). Given the mass ratios for both events\r
and the aligned spins χ1,z of their primaries (near zero\r
for GW200105, probably negative for GW200115), we\r
do not expect tidal disruption to occur, which would re\u0002quire more equal masses or more positive χ1,z (Rantsiou\r
et al. 2008; Shibata & Taniguchi 2008; Etienne et al.\r
2009; Foucart et al. 2011; Kyutoku et al. 2011; Pannar\u0002ale 2013; Foucart et al. 2018).\r
To quantitatively confirm this expectation, we use\r
the spectral representation of equations of state from\r
Abbott et al. (2018a), which uses an SLY low-density\r
crust model (Douchin & Haensel 2001) and parame\u0002terizes the adiabatic index into a polynomial in the\r
logarithm of the pressure (Lindblom 2010; Lindblom\r
& Indik 2012, 2014). Following Stachie et al. (2021),\r
we marginalize the parameter estimation samples from\r
the NSBH analyses over these equations of state. For\r
a fixed equation of state, we compute the maximum\r
Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov (TOV) mass, allowing us\r
to infer the nature (NS or BH) of the lighter binary\r
compact object, as well as its radius R2, compactness\r
C2 = Gm2/(R2c\r
2\r
) and baryon mass. Based on these,\r
we define a total ejecta mass mej (Fern´andez et al. 2019)\r
as the sum of dynamical ejecta (Kr¨uger & Foucart 2020)\r
and 15% of the mass of disk winds (Foucart et al. 2018).\r
For both events, we find that mej < 10−6M\f for 99% of\r
the samples.\r
The absence of ejecta is compatible with the lack of\r
observed EM counterparts. However, given the large\r
distances of the mergers (' 300 Mpc) and the large un\u0002certainties of their sky localization, EM emission would\r
have been difficult to detect and associate with these\r
GW events.\r
Table 3. Probability that the secondary mass is below the\r
maximum NS mass Mmax for each event, given different spin\r
assumptions and different choices for the maximum NS mass.\r
The values shown use a flat prior in m2; alternative, astro\u0002physically motivated mass priors, can cause the estimates to\r
vary by up to 11% across our chosen models.\r
p(m2 < Mmax)\r
spin prior choice of Mmax GW200105 GW200115\r
|χ2| < 0.05 Mmax,TOV 96% 98%\r
|χ2| < 0.99 Mmax(χ2) 94% 95%\r
|χ2| < 0.99 Mmax,GNS 93% 96%\r
Estimating the impact of nonlinear p–g tidal coupling\r
(Abbott et al. 2019c), we find that it would produce\r
a relative frequency-domain phase shift for GW200105\r
(GW200115) of approximately 134 (38) times smaller\r
than the equivalent phase shift for GW170817. This\r
strongly reduced effect is caused by the larger chirp\r
masses, more asymmetric mass ratios, and the presence\r
of only a single NS. Since p–g effects were not detected\r
for GW170817 (Abbott et al. 2019c), they will be unob\u0002servable within the new NSBH systems.\r
5.2. Consistency of component masses with the NS\r
maximum mass\r
Even without definite identification of matter signa\u0002tures in the signals, we can compare the observed m2\r
for GW200105 and GW200115 with the maximum NS\r
mass, Mmax. The existence of massive pulsars (Anto\u0002niadis et al. 2013; Cromartie et al. 2019; Fonseca et al.\r
2021) places a lower bound of Mmax & 2 M\f on the\r
maximum NS mass. Studies of GW170817’s remnant\r
typically suggest that the maximum mass of a nonrotat\u0002ing NS—the TOV mass—is Mmax,TOV . 2.3 M\f (e.g.,\r
Shibata et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020b; Nathanail et al.\r
2021). However, rapid rotation could support a larger\r
Mmax. Given the considerable uncertainty in Mmax, we\r
examine three different scenarios. Following Essick &\r
Landry (2020), we compute for each scenario the prob\u0002ability p(m2 < Mmax) that the secondary mass is below\r
the maximum NS mass by marginalizing over the uncer\u0002tainty in Mmax and the uncertainty of our m2 measure\u0002ment.\r
Supposing that the secondaries are slowly spinning,\r
we consider in the first row of Table 3 an estimate of\r
Mmax,TOV from a nonparametric astrophysical inference\r
of the equation of state (Landry et al. 2020), which pre\u0002dicts Mmax,TOV = 2.22+0.30\r
−0.20 M\f and is shown in Fig. 4.\r
We then relax the low-spin assumption, estimating in\r
the second row the maximum rotationally supported

13\r
mass Mmax(χ2), and the breakup spin χmax with the\r
universal relations from Breu & Rezzolla (2016). In this\r
scenario, we require m2 ≤ Mmax(χ2) and χ2 ≤ χmax\r
for consistency with an NS. Finally, in the third row,\r
we consider a parametric fit to the entire distribution\r
of observed Galactic NSs, including rapidly rotating\r
pulsars (Farr & Chatziioannou 2020), which predicts\r
Mmax,GNS = 2.25+0.71\r
−0.31 M\f, and is shown in Fig. 4. This\r
scenario accounts for the possibility that the maximum\r
mass in the NS population is limited by the astrophysi\u0002cal processes that form compact binaries. Assuming low\r
spin (first row), we find probabilities of 96% and 98%\r
that the secondaries in GW200105 and GW200115, re\u0002spectively, are consistent with an NS assuming a uniform\r
prior in m2. The possibility of large secondary spin re\u0002duces these probabilities by up to 3% (second and third\r
rows).\r
So far, this analysis has assumed priors that are uni\u0002form in component masses. However, there is consid\u0002erable uncertainty in the astrophysical mass priors of\r
such systems, and different prior assumptions can af\u0002fect the component mass posteriors for detections with\r
moderate S/N. To illustrate the impact of population\r
assumptions, we consider three alternative priors: one\r
based on Salpeter mass distributions, p(m) ∼ m−2.3\r
(Salpeter 1955), independently for each component; one\r
based on an extrapolation of the BBH mass model Bro\u0002ken Power Law from Abbott et al. (2021b) down to\r
0.5 M\f for both components; and another based on a\r
similar extrapolation of the Power Law + Peak BBH\r
mass model from the same study. We marginalize over\r
the uncertainties in the latter two models, which are fit\r
to the BBH population from Abbott et al. (2021c), in\u0002cluding the outlier event GW190814 with a secondary\r
component mass below 3 M\f (Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
These different mass priors change the numbers in\r
Table 3 by at most 11%, with the smallest values for\r
GW200105 and GW200115 being 89% and 87%, respec\u0002tively. The decrease is due to the three priors assigning\r
more probability density to equal-mass systems, thus fa\u0002voring larger m2. Thus, the secondaries of both systems\r
are consistent with NSs based on our assumptions about\r
the equation of state and the mass distribution.\r
However, consistency with the maximum NS mass\r
does not exclude the possibility that the secondaries\r
could be BHs or exotic compact objects, if such objects\r
also exist within the NS mass range. For instance, mod\u0002els of primordial BHs predict a peak in the primordial\r
BH mass function at ∼ 1 M\f (Carr et al. 2021). These\r
models also predict that primordial BHs may form co\u0002alescing binaries at mass ratios comparable to those re\u0002ported here.\r

6. ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS\r
The first confident observations of NSBH binaries en\u0002able us to study this novel type of astrophysical system\r
in entirely new ways. We pursue three different avenues\r
in this section. First, we infer the merger rate of NSBH\r
binaries in the local universe. We then place the inferred\r
source properties and merger rate in the context of mod\u0002els of NSBH formation channels and previous EM and\r
GW observations of BHs and NSs. Finally, we investi\u0002gate to what extent the events reported here can serve\r
to measure the Hubble constant and whether lensing of\r
GWs may have played a role in the observations.\r
6.1. Merger rate density\r
We infer the NSBH merger rate density with our ob\u0002servations using two different approaches.\r
In the first approach, we consider only GW200105\r
and GW200115. Following the method of Kim et al.\r
(2003) as previously used in, e.g., Abbott et al. (2016e,\r
2020d), we calculate an event-based merger rate assum\u0002ing one Poisson-distributed count each from GW200105-\r
and GW200115-like populations. We calculate semian\u0002alytically the search sensitivities across O1, O2, and\r
the first nine months of O3 to NSBH populations cor\u0002responding to the mass and spin posteriors for the\r
two events. We then calibrate these sensitivities to\r
the results of GstLAL (Cannon et al. 2012; Privitera\r
et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev et al. 2019;\r
Hanna et al. 2020) using a broad NSBH-like popula\u0002tion and an FAR threshold of 1/(2.8 yr). This FAR\r
threshold is chosen to include only GW200105 and\r
GW200115 while excluding low-significance triggers like

14\r
GW190426 152155, though a more conservative thresh\u0002old of 1/(100 yr) as used in, e.g., Abbott et al. (2016e,\r
2020d), changes the estimated sensitivities by less than\r
15%. Applying the Poisson Jeffreys prior proportional\r
to R\r
−1/2\r
i\r
, we find R200105 = 16+38\r
−14 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
, and\r
R200115 = 36+82\r
−30 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. The PyCBC detection of\r
GW200115, using the same method but with an inde\u0002pendent set of injections for calibration (Tiwari 2018),\r
yields a consistent R200115 = 40+92\r
−34 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. Com\u0002bining the likelihoods over R200105 and R200115 accord\u0002ing to Kim et al. (2003) and applying the Jeffreys prior\r
to the total rate, we find the total event-based NSBH\r
merger rate density RNSBH = 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
, plot\u0002ted in green in Fig. 9.\r
The second approach to calculating a merger rate\r
takes into account not only GW200105 and GW200115,\r
but also less significant search triggers with masses con\u0002sistent with the typical range associated with NSBH bi\u0002naries. Specifically, we consider triggers across O1, O2\r
and the first nine months of O3 with associated com\u0002ponent masses m1 ∈ [2.5, 40] M\f and m2 ∈ [1, 3] M\f,\r
i.e. broader ranges than the component mass poste\u0002riors for GW200105 and GW200115 obtained in §4.\r
The cut-off of m2 ≤ 3M\f is chosen as a robust up\u0002per limit on the maximum NS mass (Rhoades & Ruffini\r
1974; Kalogera & Baym 1996). The population is de\u0002fined to be uniformly distributed in comoving volume,\r
uniform in log component masses in the given ranges,\r
with aligned spins with spin magnitudes distributed uni\u0002formly in [0, 0.95]. We use as input GstLAL search\r
triggers above an S/N threshold such that the number\r
of noise triggers exceeds the number of astrophysical sig\u0002nals by a factor ∼100. Following Farr et al. (2015); Ka\u0002padia et al. (2020), we find the resulting joint likelihood\r
on Poisson parameters for signals of each astrophysical\r
category (ΛBNS,ΛNSBH,ΛBBH), and for terrestrial noise\r
triggers Λbackground. Here, the BBH and BNS categories\r
are defined to include triggers where both component\r
masses fall within 5–100 M\f or 1–2.5 M\f, respectively.\r
We apply the Jeffreys prior and recover a merger rate\r
density RNSBH = ΛNSBH/hV TiNSBH, where hV TiNSBH\r
is the population-averaged sensitive time–volume esti\u0002mated using the GstLAL pipeline and the NSBH pop\u0002ulation defined above. This yields an estimated NSBH\r
merger rate density of RNSBH = 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
,\r
the black line in Fig. 9.\r
While this rate is higher than our event-based rate,\r
it considers a wider population that includes addi\u0002tional triggers; for example, the component masses of\r
GW190814 (although the nature of its secondary is un\u0002certain) fall within this population. The calculation is\r
also based on the component mass values of GstLAL\r
search triggers, adjusted with an analytical model (Fong\r
2018) of the response of the template bank to signals\r
with a given distribution of true masses. This procedure\r
is expected to be less precise than Bayesian parameter\r
estimation, which is impractical for the large numbers\r
of triggers involved.\r
The merger rate density measured here is consistent\r
with the upper bound of 610 Gpc−3 yr−1 derived from\r
the absence of NSBH detections in O1 and O2 (Abbott\r
et al. 2019a). Revised merger rate estimates for all CBC\r
sources will be provided in a future analysis of the full\r
O3 data set.\r
6.2. System origins\r
To understand the origin of GW200105 and\r
GW200115, we compare their observed masses and spins\r
with theoretical predictions. Population synthesis stud\u0002ies modeling the various formation channels of merging\r
compact object binaries distinguish between NSs and\r
BHs with a simple mass cut, typically between 2 and\r
3 M\f. This is consistent with the secondary masses of\r
both events being classified as NSs, so for the purposes of\r
discussing formation channels for these events and pre\u0002dicted rates, we will discuss GW200105 and GW200115\r
in the context of them being NSBHs.\r
6.2.1. Formation channels\r
Formation channels of NSBH can be broadly catego\u0002rized as either isolated binary evolution or one of several\r
dynamical formation channels (e.g., globular clusters or\r
nuclear star clusters). Since isolated binaries form in\r
young star clusters and can be influenced by dynamical\r
interactions before the cluster dissolves and the binary\r
effectively becomes isolated, rates from young star clus\u0002ters naturally encompass rates from isolated binaries.\r
Predicted rates of NSBH mergers in the local universe\r
vary by orders of magnitude across the various forma\u0002tion channels.\r
Models of the canonical isolated binary evolution\r
channel—in which stellar progenitors evolve together,\r
shedding orbital angular momentum through phases of\r
stable and/or unstable mass transfer prior to compact\r
object formation—predict NSBH merger rate densities\r
around 0.1–800 Gpc−3 yr−1(Belczynski et al. 2002; Sip\u0002ior & Sigurdsson 2002; Belczynski et al. 2006, 2016; Do\u0002minik et al. 2015; Eldridge et al. 2017; Kruckow et al.\r
2018; Mapelli & Giacobbo 2018; Neijssel et al. 2019;\r
Drozda et al. 2020; Zevin et al. 2020; Broekgaarden et al.\r
2021). The high uncertainty is driven by the lack of\r
observed NSBHs and the wide range of model assump\u0002tions. Merger rates are sensitive to the treatment of\r
common envelopes, which may be a necessary evolu\u0002tionary phase for producing compact binaries in tight

15\r
orbits capable of merging in a Hubble time (Ivanova\r
et al. 2013). They are also sensitive to prescriptions for\r
supernova kick magnitudes. While moderate kicks can\r
produce eccentric orbits that merge on short timescales,\r
high supernova kicks may disrupt the progenitor bina\u0002ries and suppress the merger rate (Belczynski et al. 2002;\r
Giacobbo & Mapelli 2020; Tang et al. 2020).\r
Models of star formation in the dynamical environ\u0002ments of young star clusters predict NSBH merger rate\r
densities of 0.1–100 Gpc−3 yr−1(Fragione & Banerjee\r
2020; Hoang et al. 2020; Rastello et al. 2020; Santoliq\u0002uido et al. 2020). In this scenario, most systems that\r
form merging NSBH (∼80%) are ejected without under\u0002going dynamical exchanges, proceeding to merge in the\r
field.\r
Models of dynamical formation channels in denser en\u0002vironments typically predict much lower merger rates.\r
For instance, in globular clusters and nuclear star clus\u0002ters, BHs segregate and dominate the core, where the\r
bulk of dynamical interactions occur (Portegies Zwart &\r
McMillan 2000; Morscher et al. 2015), so that encounters\r
between NSs and BHs are relatively rare, with NSBH\r
merger rate densities on the order of 10−2 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
(Clausen et al. 2013; Arca Sedda 2020; Ye et al. 2020).\r
In disks of active galactic nuclei, the presence of gas\r
could possibly increase the NSBH merger rate density\r
up to 300 Gpc−3 yr−1(McKernan et al. 2020).\r
NSBHs may also merge via hierarchical triple inter\u0002actions, where inner NSBH binaries are driven to high\r
eccentricity by massive tertiary companions and merge\r
on rapid timescales (Antonini et al. 2017; Silsbee &\r
Tremaine 2017). However, the predicted merger rates\r
are negligible unless supernova kicks are assumed to be\r
zero (Fragione & Loeb 2019).\r
It is likely that a combination of the above channels\r
contribute to the astrophysical NSBH merger rate. How\u0002ever, the isolated binary evolution, young star cluster,\r
and active galactic nuclei channels are capable of indi\u0002vidually accounting for the NSBH merger rate estimated\r
here.\r
6.2.2. Masses\r
While there are no observed NSBHs in the Milky\r
Way, we can place the component masses of GW200105\r
and GW200115 in the context of the observed pop\u0002ulation of BH and NS masses, as well as the pre\u0002dicted populations of NSBHs. Observations suggest\r
that the mass distribution of the Galactic population\r
of NSs peaks around 1.33 M\f, with a secondary peak\r
around 1.9 M\f (Antoniadis et al. 2016; Alsing et al.\r
2018). The secondary mass observed in GW200115 and\r
marginal event GW190426 152155 are consistent with\r
the population peaking at 1.33 M\f, while the secondary\r
observed in GW200105 (' 1.9 M\f) and the primary\r
component from BNS merger GW190425 (m1 = 1.60–\r
1.87 M\f; Abbott et al. 2020a) are consistent with the\r
high-mass population. However, a rigorous association\r
of the events with different components of the NS pop\u0002ulation would require a thorough population analysis.\r
Radio observations of BNS systems do not find such\r
massive NSs, leading to speculation as to the origin of\r
GW190425 (Romero-Shaw et al. 2020; Safarzadeh et al.\r
2020; Galaudage et al. 2021; Mandel et al. 2021). Stel\u0002lar metallicities in the Milky Way are not representative\r
of all populations of GW sources (O’Shaughnessy et al.\r
2008, 2010; Belczynski et al. 2010; Eldridge et al. 2017;\r
Neijssel et al. 2019).\r
The BH masses observed in GW200105 and\r
GW200115 (8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f, respectively)\r
are in line with predictions from population synthesis\r
models for NSBH mergers from isolated binary evolu\u0002tion and young star clusters. In NSBHs, current binary\r
evolution models do not predict BH masses above ' 10\r
M\f (Eldridge et al. 2017; Kruckow et al. 2018; Mapelli &\r
Giacobbo 2018; Broekgaarden et al. 2021), while Popu\u0002lation III NSBHs (Kinugawa et al. 2017) and dynamical\r
interactions in low-metallicity young star clusters allow\r
for higher BH masses (Ziosi et al. 2014; Rastello et al.\r
2020).\r
Electromagnetic observations of X-ray binaries have\r
not uncovered BHs between 3 and 5 M\f, leading to spec\u0002ulation about a mass gap (Ozel et al. ¨ 2010; Farr et al.\r
2011; Kreidberg et al. 2012; Miller & Miller 2014). Anal\u0002ysis of GWTC-2 has also found evidence for a gap or\r
dip in the BH mass spectrum between ∼2.6 and 4 M\f\r
(Fishbach et al. 2020). For GW200115, we find nonneg\u0002ligible support for the primary lying in this mass gap,\r
with p(3 M\f < m1 < 5 M\f) = 30% (27%) under the\r
high-spin (low-spin) priors. This low-mass region is cor\u0002related with negative values of the parallel component\r
of the primary spin; see §6.2.3 below.\r
In summary, the masses inferred for GW200105 and\r
GW200115 are consistent with expectations for NSBHs;\r
their primary masses are in agreement with predictions\r
for BH masses in population synthesis models of the\r
dominant formation scenarios. Meanwhile, their sec\u0002ondary masses are compatible with the observed pop\u0002ulation of Galactic NSs, as well as the masses inferred\r
from GW observations of BNS mergers.\r
6.2.3. Spins\r
Spin information encoded in GWs from binaries are\r
a probe of the their evolutionary history (Farr et al.\r
2017, 2018; Stevenson et al. 2017; Talbot & Thrane

16\r
2017; Vitale et al. 2017b; Wysocki et al. 2019). The\r
BHs in binaries are expected to exhibit a range of spin\r
magnitudes and orientations, depending on how they\r
formed (Kalogera 2000; Mandel & O'Shaughnessy 2010;\r
Rodriguez et al. 2016; Liu & Lai 2017, 2018; Antonini\r
et al. 2018; Kruckow et al. 2018; Bavera et al. 2020;\r
Chattopadhyay et al. 2020). The highest dimensionless\r
NS spin implied by pulsar-timing observations of bina\u0002ries that merge within a Hubble time is ∼0.04 (Stovall\r
et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2018).\r
While the secondary spins of both events reported\r
here are poorly constrained due to the unequal masses,\r
the primary spins of GW200105 and GW200115 can\r
be placed in the context of predictions for BH spins\r
from models of stellar and dynamical evolution and\r
EM observations of NSBH progenitors. As can be seen\r
in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the primary spins of GW200105\r
and GW200115 are consistent with zero (0.08+0.22\r
−0.08 and\r
0.33+0.48\r
−0.29, respectively), but moderate values of spin are\r
not ruled out. The primary in GW200115 may even have\r
relatively high spin, with a 90% upper limit of 0.72. Sev\u0002eral studies of the observed population of high-mass X\u0002ray binaries (Liu et al. 2008; Gou et al. 2009, 2014; Zhao\r
et al. 2021) find that the BHs have large spins (Valsec\u0002chi et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2012; Qin et al. 2019; Zhao\r
et al. 2021). Given the short lifetime of the secondary,\r
mass transfer is argued to be insufficient to generate BHs\r
with such high spins, implying that the BHs were born\r
with high spins. Belczynski et al. (2011) found that one\r
such high-mass X-ray binary, Cygnus X-1, is expected\r
to form an NSBH with a BH that carries near-maximal\r
spin, although it would not merge within a Hubble time.\r
However, following revised estimates of the component\r
masses of Cygnus X-1 (Miller-Jones et al. 2021), Nei\u0002jssel et al. (2021) found that it will most likely form a\r
BBH. Meanwhile, analyses of GWTC-1 and GWTC-2\r
have found evidence for BH spin (Abbott et al. 2016f;\r
Vitale et al. 2017; Chatziioannou et al. 2019; Kimball\r
et al. 2020; Abbott et al. 2021b), though they do not\r
determine whether those BHs may have been formed\r
with that spin. Altogether, these EM and GW observa\u0002tions of compact binaries and their progenitors suggest\r
a range of BH natal spins in NSBH binaries.\r
Along with their magnitudes, the alignments of com\u0002ponent spins with the overall binary orbital angular mo\u0002mentum are of astrophysical interest. In particular, we\r
find evidence that the primary BH spin in GW200115\r
is negatively aligned with respect to the orbital angular\r
momentum axis, with p(χ1,z < 0) = 88% (87%) under\r
the high-spin (low-spin) prior and with the more neg\u0002ative values of χ1,z correlated with smaller m1. This\r
negative alignment is consistent with dynamical forma\u0002tion channels, which typically form binaries with ran\u0002dom spin orientations (Rodriguez et al. 2016), but the\r
predicted rates from these channels, discussed in §6.2,\r
are small. Binaries born in isolation are expected to\r
form with only small misalignments (. 30°; Kalogera\r
2000), though they may become misaligned by super\u0002nova kicks at compact object formation (Rodriguez et al.\r
2016; Gerosa et al. 2018; Wysocki et al. 2018), and\r
possibly during subsequent evolution via mass transfer\r
(Stegmann & Antonini 2021). Meanwhile, NSBH pro\u0002genitor binaries originating in young star clusters can\r
be perturbed via close dynamical encounters before be\u0002ing ejected into the field. Therefore, a misaligned spin\r
in the primary of GW200115 would not necessarily rule\r
out any of the plausible NSBH formation channels.\r
6.3. Cosmology and lensing\r
Gravitational wave sources are standard sirens, pro\u0002viding a direct measurement of their luminosity dis\u0002tance (Schutz 1986; Holz & Hughes 2005), and they can\r
be used to measure the Hubble constant (Abbott et al.\r
2017c; Fishbach et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2021a). Due to\r
the lack of a confirmed EM counterpart and large num\u0002bers of galaxies inside the localization volumes of each of\r
the two events, we do not obtain any informative bounds\r
on H0 from these observations.\r
The detections of GW200105 and GW200115 are sep\u0002arated by only ∼10 days. One explanation for the small\r
time-delay could be that the two events are created by\r
gravitational lensing by a galaxy (Haris et al. 2018).\r
Gravitational lensing is unlikely even a priori (Smith\r
et al. 2017; Ng et al. 2018b), and the nonoverlapping\r
mass posteriors (Fig. 4) further exclude it as a possible\r
explanation (Haris et al. 2018). While GW200115 and\r
GW190426 152155 exhibit agreement in their source\r
mass posteriors, their sky localization areas do not over\u0002lap, and their detector-frame (redshifted) chirp masses\r
show only marginal overlap (Abbott et al. 2021c), ruling\r
out lensing as a possible explanation.\r
7. CONCLUSIONS\r
During its third observing run, the LIGO–Virgo GW\r
detector network observed GW200105 and GW200115,\r
two GW events consistent with NSBH coalescences.\r
GW200105 is effectively a single-detector event observed\r
in LIGO Livingston with an S/N of 13.9. It clearly\r
stands apart from all recorded noise transients, but its\r
statistical confidence is difficult to establish. GW200115\r
was observed in coincidence by the network with an S/N\r
of 11.6 and FAR of <1/(1 × 105 yr).\r
The source component masses of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 make it likely that these events originated

17\r
from NSBH coalescences. Their primary masses are\r
found to be m1 = 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and m1 = 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f,\r
which are consistent with predictions of BH masses in\r
population synthesis models for NSBHs. Their sec\u0002ondary masses, inferred to be m2 = 1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f and\r
m2 = 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f, respectively, are consistent with the\r
observed NS mass distribution in the Milky Way, as well\r
as population synthesis predictions for secondary masses\r
in merging NSBHs.\r
We find no evidence of measurable tides or tidal dis\u0002ruption for either of the two signals, and no EM coun\u0002terparts to either detection have been identified. As\r
such, there is no direct evidence that the secondaries\r
are NSs, and our observations are consistent with either\r
event being a BBH merger. However, the absence of\r
tidal measurements and EM counterparts is to be ex\u0002pected given the properties and distances of the two\r
events. Moreover, the comparisons of the secondary\r
masses to the maximum allowed NS mass yield a proba\u0002bility p(m2 ≤ Mmax) of 89%–96% and 87%–98% for the\r
secondaries in GW200105 and GW200115, respectively,\r
being compatible with NSs (see §5.2).\r
The effective inspiral spin parameter of GW200105 is\r
strongly peaked around zero: χeff = −0.01+0.11\r
−0.15. For\r
the second event, GW200115, the effective inspiral spin\r
parameter is inferred to be χeff = −0.19+0.23\r
−0.35. For\r
GW200115, the spin component parallel to the orbital\r
angular momentum of the primary is χ1,z = −0.19+0.24\r
−0.50,\r
and we find support for negatively aligned primary spin\r
(χ1,z < 0) at 88% probability. More negative values of\r
χ1,z in GW200115 are correlated with particularly small\r
primary masses reaching into the lower mass gap. We\r
find p(3 M\f <m1 <5 M\f) = 30% (27%) under the high\u0002spin (low-spin) parameter estimation priors. We find no\r
conclusive evidence for spin-induced orbital precession\r
in either system.\r
We estimate the merger rate density of NSBH bina\u0002ries with two approaches. Assuming that GW200105\r
and GW200115 are representative of the entire NSBH\r
population, we find RNSBH = 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. Con\u0002versely, assuming a broader range of allowed primary\r
and secondary masses, and considering all triggers in\r
O3, we find RNSBH = 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. These\r
are the first direct measurements of the NSBH merger\r
rate. Both estimates are broadly consistent with the\r
rate predicted from NSBH formation in isolated bina\u0002ries or young star clusters. Formation channels in dense\r
star clusters (globular or nuclear) and in triples predict\r
lower rates than those inferred from the two events and\r
are unlikely to be the dominant NSBH formation chan\u0002nels.\r
The observations of GW200105 and GW200115 are\r
consistent with predictions for merging NSBHs and ob\u0002servations of BHs and NSs in the Milky Way. Given their\r
significantly unequal component masses, future observa\u0002tions of NSBH systems will provide new opportunities to\r
study matter under extreme conditions, including tidal\r
disruption, and search for potential deviations from GR.\r

We report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences in LIGO’s\r
and Virgo’s third observing run with properties consistent with neutron star–black hole (NSBH)\r
binaries. The two events are named GW200105 162426 and GW200115 042309, abbreviated as\r
GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second\r
by all three LIGO–Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and\r
1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f, whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f and 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f (all\r
measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary’s mass is below\r
the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%–96% and 87%–98%, respectively, for GW200105 and\r
GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity\r
distances are 280+110\r
−110 Mpc and 300+150−100 Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of\r
GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For\r
GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at\r
88% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component\r
for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1 when assuming that\r
GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1 under\r
the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses."""

In January 2020, the LIGO–Virgo detector net\u0002work observed gravitational-wave (GW) signals from\r
two compact binary inspirals which are consistent\r
with neutron star–black hole (NSBH) binaries. These\r
represent the first confident observations to date of\r
NSBH binaries via any observational means. The two\r
events, carrying the full designations GW200105 162426\r
and GW200115 042309, and abbreviated henceforth as\r
GW200105 and GW200115, were detected on January\r
05, 2020 at 16:24:26 UTC and January 15, 2020 at\r
04:23:10 UTC, respectively. The coincident detection\r
of GW200115 by the three detectors LIGO Hanford,\r
LIGO Livingston, and Virgo gives it high confidence\r
of being an astrophysical GW event. During the other\r
event, GW200105, the LIGO Hanford detector was not\r
operational and, owing to the small signal-to-noise ra\u0002tio (S/N) in Virgo, it was effectively a single-detector\r
event in LIGO Livingston. While quantification of the\r
confidence of single-detector events is subject to signifi\u0002cant uncertainty, GW200105 stands clearly apart in the\r
LIGO Livingston data from any other candidate with\r
NSBH-like parameters during the ∼11 months of the\r
third observing run (O3).\r
The component masses inferred from these binary in\u0002spirals provide information on the nature of their com\u0002ponents. The primaries have masses of m1 = 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f\r
and m1 = 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f, for GW200105 and GW200115,\r
respectively, with uncertainties quoted at the 90% cred\u0002ible level. These primary masses are well above the max\u0002imum mass of a neutron star (NS; Rhoades & Ruffini\r
1974; Abbott et al. 2018a; Shibata et al. 2019; Cromar\u0002tie et al. 2019; Farr & Chatziioannou 2020; Nathanail\r
et al. 2021; Fonseca et al. 2021) and within the mass\u0002range of black holes (BHs) observed electromagnetically\r
(Ozel et al. ¨ 2010; Farr et al. 2011; Kreidberg et al.\r
2012; Miller & Miller 2014) and via GWs (Abbott et al.\r
2016a, 2019a, 2021c). The masses of the secondaries are\r
m2 = 1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f and m2 = 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f, respectively, for\r
GW200105 and GW200115, within the mass range of\r
known NSs (Antoniadis et al. 2016; Alsing et al. 2018;\r
Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020a).\r
Detections of NSBHs have so far remained elusive in\r
both electromagnetic (EM) and GW surveys. In the\r
past four decades, surveys have identified 19 binary neu\u0002arXiv:2106.15163v1 [astro-ph.HE] 29 Jun 2021

2\r
tron star (BNS) systems in the Galaxy (Farrow et al.\r
2019; Agazie et al. 2021); however, the discovery of a\r
pulsar in an NSBH binary remains a key objective for\r
current and future radio observations (Liu et al. 2014;\r
Weltman et al. 2020).\r
Similarly, GW observations of LIGO and Virgo\r
through the first part of the O3 run (O3a) have led to\r
the identification of 48 binary black hole (BBH) candi\u0002dates (Abbott et al. 2019a, 2021c) and two BNS candi\u0002dates (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020c). Independent anal\u0002yses of the public detector data identified additional\r
GW candidates (Venumadhav et al. 2019, 2020; Za\u0002ckay et al. 2019a,b; Magee et al. 2019; Nitz et al. 2019,\r
2020b; Nitz et al. 2021). The absence of NSBH candi\u0002dates in LIGO and Virgo’s first and second observing\r
runs (O1 and O2, respectively) led to the upper limit\r
on the local merger rate density of NSBH systems of\r
RNSBH ≤ 610 Gpc−3 yr−1 at the 90% credible level (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2019a).\r
During O3a, two events were notable as possible\r
NSBH candidates. First, GW190426 152155 (Abbott\r
et al. 2021c) was identified as a marginal NSBH can\u0002didate with false alarm rate (1.4/yr) so high that it\r
could also plausibly be a detector noise artifact. Sec\u0002ond, GW190814 (Abbott et al. 2020d) may have been\r
an NSBH merger. Although GW190814’s secondary\r
mass of m2 = 2.59+0.08\r
−0.09 M\f likely exceeds the maxi\u0002mum mass supported by slowly spinning NSs (Essick\r
& Landry 2020; Fattoyev et al. 2020; Tews et al. 2021;\r
Godzieba et al. 2021), such as those found in known\r
binaries that will coalesce within a Hubble time, the\r
secondary could conceivably be an NS spinning near its\r
breakup frequency (Essick & Landry 2020; Tews et al.\r
2021; Most et al. 2020; Dexheimer et al. 2021).\r
The existence of NSBH systems has long been con\u0002jectured. Observations in the Milky Way reveal high\u0002mass X-ray binaries composed of a massive star and a\r
compact object (Liu et al. 2008; Orosz et al. 2009; Gou\r
et al. 2009; Orosz et al. 2011; Gou et al. 2014). Binary\r
evolution models show that X-ray binaries with a BH\r
component are possible progenitors of NSBH systems\r
(Belczynski et al. 2013; Grudzinska et al. 2015).\r
Major uncertainties regarding massive binary evolu\u0002tion, such as mass loss, mass transfer and the impact of\r
supernova explosions result in a wide range of merger\r
rate predictions: 0.1–800 Gpc−3 yr−1(Belczynski et al.\r
2002; Sipior & Sigurdsson 2002; Belczynski et al. 2006;\r
Dominik et al. 2015; Belczynski et al. 2016; Eldridge\r
et al. 2017; Mapelli & Giacobbo 2018; Kruckow et al.\r
2018; Neijssel et al. 2019; Drozda et al. 2020; Zevin\r
et al. 2020; Broekgaarden et al. 2021). Comparable\r
NSBH merger rates are predicted from young star clus\u0002ters (Ziosi et al. 2014; Rastello et al. 2020) while NSBH\r
merger rates in globular and nuclear clusters are pre\u0002dicted to be orders of magnitude lower (Clausen et al.\r
2013; Ye et al. 2020; Fragione & Banerjee 2020; Hoang\r
et al. 2020; Arca Sedda 2020). Measuring the NSBH\r
merger rate and properties such as masses and spins is\r
crucial in determining formation channels.\r

The two events reported here were observed in the sec\u0002ond part of the third observing run (O3b). At the time\r

and LIGO Hanford was not operational. At the time\r
of GW200115, all three interferometers had been in a\r
stable operational state for over 2 hrs. The BNS ranges\r

during detector improvements carried out between O3a\r

To verify that instrumental noise artifacts do not bias\r

GW200115 was initially identified by all four low\u0002latency matched-filtering pipelines as a possible com\u0002pact binary coalescence (CBC) candidate in LIGO Han\u0002ford and LIGO Livingston: GstLAL (Cannon et al.\r
2012; Privitera et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev\r
et al. 2019; Hanna et al. 2020), MBTAOnline (Aubin\r

et al. 2016), and SPIIR (Luan et al. 2012; Hooper et al.\r
2012; Chu et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2018). As detailed\r
in Abbott et al. (2021c), matched-filtering searches use\r
banks (Owen & Sathyaprakash 1999; Harry et al. 2009;\r
Privitera et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2017, 2019) of modeled\r

observed by the LIGO detectors, so GW200115 was re\u0002ported as a two-detector event in the GraceDB event\r
database named S200115j with a merger time of January\r
15, 2020 at 04:23:10 UTC.\r
A public Preliminary Gamma-ray burst Coordinates\r
Network (GCN) Notice was sent out six minutes af\u0002ter the event (LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo\r
Collaboration 2020a). The low-latency BAYESTAR\r
(Singer & Price 2016) sky map computed from the orig\u0002inal trigger, which was produced from MBTAOnline,\r
indicated a possible discrepancy compared to those from\r
the other three pipelines. Therefore, the representative\r
trigger was manually switched to the one from GstLAL\r
(LIGO Scientific Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration\r
2020b). The associated sky map is shown in the bottom\r
panel of Fig. 2 with a solid black line with 90% credible\r
area of 900 deg2. The GCN Circular reported a prob\u0002ability > 99% for the lighter compact object to have a\r
mass below 3M\f, derived from a machine-learning anal\u0002ysis (Kapadia et al. 2020; Chatterjee et al. 2020). The\r
RAVEN pipeline (Urban 2016), which looks for coinci\u0002dent gamma ray bursts (GRBs), did not report an asso\u0002ciated GRB trigger from Fermi-GBM or the Neil Gehrels\r
Swift Observatory within −1 s and +5 s of the GW trig\u0002ger. A total of 31 GCN Circulars (GCN archive for\r
S200115j 2020) reporting follow-up observations were\r
published for this event. To date, no EM counterpart\r
has been reported associated with GW200115.\r
After the low-latency identification of GW200115, the\r
extended periods of strain data around the event are\r
further analyzed by the detection pipelines in their of\u0002fline configurations using improved calibration and re\u0002fined data quality information that is not available in low\r
latency (Abbott et al. 2018b, 2021c; Davis et al. 2021).\r
In this analysis, we also subtract nonstationary noise\r
due to the nonlinear coupling of the 60 Hz power mains

5\r
at the LIGO detectors using coupling functions derived\r
from machine-learning techniques (Vajente et al. 2020).\r
PyCBC uses a template bank constructed with a\r
hybrid geometric-random algorithm (Roy et al. 2019,\r
2017), while GstLAL and MBTA use a template bank\r
generated by a stochastic placement method (Mukher\u0002jee et al. 2021; Babak 2008; Privitera et al. 2014). Gst\u0002LAL identifies GW200115 with a network S/N of 11.6\r
and FAR of <1/(1×105 yr) using the data from Novem\u0002ber 1, 2019 15:00 UTC to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC.\r
The MBTA and PyCBC offline analyses also identified\r
the trigger in data from January 13, 2020 10:27 UTC\r
to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC, yielding consistent net\u0002work S/Ns as shown in Table 1, as well as estimated\r
FARs of 1/(182 yr) and <1/(5.6 × 104 yr), respectively.\r

GW200105 was identified by GstLAL running in the\r
low-latency configuration as a possible CBC candidate\r
in LIGO Livingston and Virgo data with network S/N of\r
13.9 and merger time January 05, 2020 at 16:24:26 UTC.\r
The candidate identified as S200105ae in GraceDB was\r
considered a single-detector event because the S/N in\r
Virgo was below the threshold S/N of 4.0.\r
The low-latency FAR of ≈ 24 per year did not pass\r
the threshold for sending a GCN alert. Without the\r
information provided by temporal coincidence between\r
different detectors and consistency in recovered param\u0002eters, it is more difficult to obtain a robust estimate\r
of the event’s significance. In fact, an alternative con\u0002figuration of GstLAL, running to test several improve\u0002ments made in the offline configuration of early O3 (Ab\u0002bott et al. 2021c), found the trigger at higher signifi\u0002cance. Therefore, validation procedures and subsequent\r
early-offline analysis were initiated. The three other low\u0002latency search pipelines, MBTAOnline, PyCBC Live,\r
and SPIIR, also generated triggers with consistent S/Ns\r
near the event time of S200105ae (see Table 1). These\r
three pipelines were not configured to assign FARs to\r
single-detector triggers and therefore did not generate\r
automatic alerts for GW200105.\r
On January 6, 2020 at 19:39:09 UTC, the initial GCN\r
Circular reported a low-latency BAYESTAR skymap\r
(solid black contours) in the top panel of Fig. 2 with 90%\r
credible region of 7700 deg2 and a 12% chance of for\u0002mation of tidally disrupted matter—relevant for a pos\u0002sible EM counterpart—as a result of the coalescence,\r
as derived from a machine-learning analysis (Kapadia\r
et al. 2020; Chatterjee et al. 2020). Using the param\u0002eters obtained from low-latency parameter estimation,\r
Figure 3. Colored shading shows the joint S/N–ξ\r
2\r
noise probability density function for LIGO Hanford (LHO),\r
LIGO Livingston (LLO), and Virgo, computed from back\u0002ground triggers found by GstLAL in the region of lighter\r
binary systems during the entire O3. The red star indicates\r
GW200105. At its position, there is no background present,\r
indicating that it stands above all of the recorded background\r
triggers. For comparison, the triggers of GW200115 and the\r
marginal GW190426 152155 are also shown.\r
the chance of formation of tidally disrupted material\r
was later revised to be negligible (see LIGO Scientific\r
Collaboration & Virgo Collaboration 2020c and §5 be\u0002low).\r
In response to the discovery notice of GW200105, mul\u0002tiple observatories carried out follow-up and shared their\r
results publicly via 21 GCN circulars (GCN archive for\r
S200105ae 2020). To date, no EM counterpart has been\r
reported associated with GW200105.\r
After the event’s identification in low latency, the\r
strain data are further analyzed by the detection\r
pipelines in their offline configuration, following pro\u0002cedures for single-detector events discussed in Abbott\r
et al. (2020a). GstLAL identifies GW200105 with an\r
S/NR of 13.9 and FAR of 1/(2.8 yr) in its offline config\u0002uration using data from November 1, 2019 15:00 UTC\r
up to January 22, 2020 18:11 UTC. For single-detector\r
events, like GW200105, the FAR estimate involves ex\u0002trapolation, as explained below. The MBTA and Py\u0002CBC offline analyses also identify the trigger in the\r
LIGO Livingston data from January 4, 2020 17:09 UTC\r
to January 13, 2020 10:27 UTC yielding the consistent\r
S/Ns shown in Table 1. The S/N for GW200105 is larger\r
than that for GW200115, even though LIGO Hanford\r
was not operational.\r
We cannot rely on only the S/N of the CBC trigger to\r
estimate its significance, i.e. to quantify how often detec\u0002tor noise mimics a possible coalescence signal. Because\r
detector noise shows significant deviation in the tails\r
from the standard Gaussianity assumptions, its prop-

6\r
erties have to be estimated empirically (Abbott et al.\r
2016c). For multi-detector triggers like GW200115, con\u0002sistency of the observed CBC trigger among two or more\r
detectors forms an integral part of establishing it as\r
a confident detection with a low FAR. On the other\r
hand, single-detector triggers can be assigned only mod\u0002est FAR values due to limited detector observational\r
time (Callister et al. 2017; Nitz et al. 2020a). Nonethe\u0002less, alternative methods can be used to estimate con\u0002fidence in a single-detector event, as was demonstrated\r
for GW190425 (Abbott et al. 2020a).\r
The signal GW200105 measured in LIGO Livingston\r
is distinct from all noise events in the entire O3 obser\u0002vation period. Specifically, Fig. 3 shows with colored\r
shading the distribution of background noise triggers\r
identified by GstLAL in the region of binary systems\r
with a chirp mass less than 4 M\f. The colored region\r
indicates the density of background noise triggers quan\u0002tified through the S/N–ξ\r
2 noise probability density func\u0002tion for the three detectors, where the autocorrelation ξ\r
2\r
provides a consistency test similar to χ\r
2\r
(Messick et al.\r
2017). The red star represents GW200105, which lies in\r
a region of this plane without noise triggers, indicating\r
that this trigger is unique within the entire O3.\r
For comparison, Fig. 3 also shows GW200115 and\r
the marginal candidate GW190426 152155 separately\r
for LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford. In general,\r
triggers such as GW200115 and GW190426 152155 in\r
Fig. 3 would not be separable from the noise by a single\r
detector alone, and it is the coincidence between multi\u0002ple detectors that raises their significance. On the other\r
hand, the coincidence was not available for GW200105,\r
yet it clearly stands out from the background in Fig. 3\r
as strong GW signals typically do.\r
The uniqueness of GW200105 within the data shown\r
leads to a upper bound on the FAR assignment compa\u0002rable to the inverse observing time. A stronger bound,\r
like the FAR quoted above, must rely on assumptions\r
made on the properties of the noise triggers if one had\r
collected the observational strain data for a longer pe\u0002riod, a process called extrapolation. As a consequence of\r
the assumptions made, the extrapolated FAR estimates\r
have large uncertainties. Since single-detector FAR es\u0002timates rely on the uniqueness within the dataset, the\r
values may change and errors may reduce as more data\r
are accumulated. At the time of the analysis, nei\u0002ther MBTA nor PyCBC had the capability to as\u0002sign a significance to single-detector triggers, although\r
GW200105 also stands out as a unique trigger in their\r
analyses. Based on these considerations, we consider\r
this trigger to be astrophysical and include it in the\r
analysis in the remainder of this paper."""

We infer the physical properties of the two GW\r
events using a coherent Bayesian analysis following the\r
methodology described in Appendix B of Abbott et al.\r
(2019a). For GW200105, data from LIGO Livingston\r
and Virgo are analyzed, whereas for GW200115, data\r
from both LIGO detectors and Virgo are used.\r
Owing to the different signal durations, we analyze\r
32 s of data for the higher-mass event GW200105 and\r
64 s of data for GW200115. All likelihood evaluations\r
use a low-frequency cutoff of flow = 20 Hz, except for\r
LIGO Livingston for GW200115, where flow = 25 Hz\r
avoids excess noise localized at low frequencies, as dis\u0002cussed in §2. The power spectral density used in the\r
likelihood calculations is the median estimate calculated\r

with the dynesty nested sampling software (Ashton\r

Speagle 2020) is the primary tool used to sample the\r

perform hypothesis testing. In addition, we use RIFT\r
(Lange et al. 2018) for the most computationally expen\u0002sive analyses and LALInference (Veitch et al. 2015)\r
for verification.\r
We base our main analyses of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 on BBH waveform models that include the\r
effects of spin-induced orbital precession and higher\u0002order multipole GW moments, but do not include tidal\r
effects on the secondary. Specifically, we use two sig\u0002nal models: IMRPhenomXPHM (Phenom PHM; Prat\u0002ten et al. 2020) from the phenomenological family and\r
SEOBNRv4PHM (EOBNR PHM; Ossokine et al. 2020)\r
from the effective one-body numerical relativity family.\r
The acronym PHM stands for Precessing Higher-order\r
multipole Moments. Henceforth, we will use the short\u0002ened names for the waveform models.\r
In order to quantify the impact of neglecting tidal ef\u0002fects, we also analyze GW200105 and GW200115 us\u0002ing two NSBH waveform models that include tidal ef\u0002fects and assume that spins are aligned with the or\u0002bital angular momentum: IMRPhenomNSBH (Phe\u0002nom NSBH; Thompson et al. 2020) and SEOB\u0002NRv4 ROM NRTidalv2 NSBH (EOBNR NSBH; Matas\r

of applicability of the NSBH models, i.e. χ1 < 0.5, χ2 <\r
0.05 for Phenom NSBH and χ1 < 0.9, χ2 < 0.05 for\r
EOBNR NSBH. We also perform aligned-spin BBH\r

The secondary objects are probably NSs based on\r
mass estimates, as discussed in detail in §5. As in ear\u0002lier GW analyses (Abbott et al. 2017a, 2020a), we pro\u0002ceed with two different priors on the secondary’s spin\r
magnitude: a low-spin prior, χ2 ≤ 0.05, which captures\r
the maximum spin observed in Galactic BNSs that will\r
merge within a Hubble time (Burgay et al. 2003), and a\r
high-spin prior, χ2 ≤ 0.99, which is agnostic about the\r
nature of the compact object. The two priors allow us\r
to investigate whether the astrophysically relevant sub\u0002case of low NS spin leads to differences in the parameter\r
estimation for the binaries. All other priors are set as in\r
previous analyses (e.g., Abbott et al. 2021c). Through\u0002out, we assume a standard flat ΛCDM cosmology with\r
Hubble constant H0 = 67.9 km s−1 Mpc−1and matter\r
density parameter Ωm = 0.3065 (Ade et al. 2016).\r
For each spin prior, we run our main analyses with\r
higher-order multipole moments and precession for both\r
waveform families, EOBNR PHM and Phenom PHM.\r
The EOBNR PHM model is used in combination with\r
RIFT and the Phenom PHM model with pbilby. The\r
parameter estimation results for the individual precess\u0002ing waveform models yield results in very good agree\u0002ment; the median values typically differ by 1/10 of the\r
width of the 90% credible interval. Nevertheless, in or\u0002der to alleviate potential biases due to different sam\u0002plers or waveform models, we combine an equal num\u0002ber of samples of each into one data set for each spin\r
prior (Abbott et al. 2016d; Ashton & Khan 2020; Ab\u0002bott et al. 2020d) and denote these as Combined PHM.\r
The quoted parameter estimates in the following sec\u0002tions are the Combined PHM high-spin prior analyses.\r
In the figures, we emphasize the high-spin prior results.\r

One of the best-constrained spin parameters is the\r

about zero, with roughly equal support for being ei\u0002ther positive or negative. For GW200115, we find mod\u0002est support for negative effective inspiral spin: χeff =\r

The joint posterior probability of the dimensionless\r

Orbital precession is caused by a spin component in\r
the orbital plane of a binary (Apostolatos et al. 1994),\r
which we parameterize using the effective precession spin\r
parameter 0 ≤ χp ≤ 1 (Schmidt et al. 2015). We infer\r
χp = 0.09+0.14\r
−0.07 for GW200105 and χp = 0.21+0.30−0.17 for\r
GW200115. To assess the significance of a measurement\r
of precession, we compute a Bayes factor between a pre\u0002cessing and nonprecessing signal model and the preces\u0002sion S/N ρp (Fairhurst et al. 2020a,b). For GW200105,\r
we find a log Bayes factor in favor of spin precession of\r
log10 B = −0.24 and precession S/N ρp = 0.74+1.35\r
−0.61. For\r
GW200115, log10 B = −0.12 and ρp = 0.97+1.57\r

both events and both diagnostics, this indicates incon\u0002clusive evidence of precession. This result is expected\r

to improve the understanding of the BBH waveform\r
models in the NSBH region of parameter space. While\r
not shown in Fig. 8, we also find good agreement be\u0002tween the primary precessing BBH waveform models;\r
see §4.\r
Second, comparing the NSBH models with the BBH\r
models without higher-order multipole moments (Phe\u0002nom and EOBNR), the NSBH models recover similar\r
posterior contours in the m2–χeff plane. This is ex\u0002pected given the asymmetric mass ratio and low S/N of\r
these NSBH observations; see, e.g. Huang et al. (2021)\r
for a demonstration that higher S/Ns would be needed\r
to see notable systematic effects. We observe differences\r
at the extreme ends of the m2–χeff contours (i.e. at the\r
smallest and largest values of m2). The construction\r
of the NSBH waveform models used here did not rely\r
on numerical relativity results at mass ratios q . 1/8,\r
nor did they include simulations with χ1z < 0 or NS\r
masses m2 > 1.4M\f (Matas et al. 2020; Thompson\r
et al. 2020). Therefore, some differences should be ex\u0002pected, especially for large m2 in GW200105. Further\u0002more, for GW200105, the tails of the m2–χeff distribu\u0002tion for Phenom NSBH and EOB NSBH at high m2 are\r
also impacted by the inability of the data to constrain\r
the tidal deformability. Hence, the posterior samples\r
include combinations of high m2 with large Λ2, despite\r
such combinations being unphysical. This effect is not\r
apparent for GW200115 because of its smaller secondary\r
mass. The isolated islands of probability in the extreme\r
tails of the distributions are due to sampling noise.\r
Last, when adding the extra physical content\r
of higher-order multipole moments in BBH models\r
(through Phenom HM and EOBNR HM), the extreme\r
ends of the m2–χeff contours are excluded, while the\r
bulk of the distributions are consistent with the posteri\u0002ors obtained with the NSBH models. In summary, these\r
comparisons indicate that (i) waveform models includ\u0002ing the same physics give comparable results; (ii) going\r
from NSBH models to comparable BBH models changes\r
the results only marginally, i.e. any effects of tides are\r
small; and (iii) inclusion of higher-order multipole mo\u0002ments changes the posterior contours more substantially\r
than inclusion of tides. We conclude that the the inclu\u0002sion of precession and higher-order multipole moments\r
afforded by the BBH waveform models is more impor\u0002tant than the impact of tides in the NSBH models."""

The tidal deformability of NSs is imprinted in the GW\r
signal, and is investigated using the parameter estima\u0002tion techniques of §4. In contrast, BHs have zero tidal\r
deformability (Binnington & Poisson 2009; Damour &\r
Nagar 2009; Chia 2020; Charalambous et al. 2021; Le\r
Tiec & Casals 2021). We infer the tidal deformabil\u0002ity Λ2 of the NSs in GW200105 and GW200115 using\r
the NSBH waveform models that include tides. We find\r
that the tidal deformabilities are uninformative relative\r
to a uniform prior in Λ2 ∈ [0, 5000]. This measurement\r
cannot establish the presence of NSs, which is expected\r
given the mass ratios and the S/N of the detections (Fou\u0002cart et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2017; Fasano et al. 2020;\r
Huang et al. 2020).\r
Toward the end of the inspiral, the BH may tidally\r
disrupt the NS and form an accretion disk (Pannar\u0002ale 2013; Foucart et al. 2018). This is hypothesized to\r
drive a relativistic jet (Pannarale et al. 2011; Pascha\u0002lidis et al. 2015). Given the mass ratios for both events\r
and the aligned spins χ1,z of their primaries (near zero\r
for GW200105, probably negative for GW200115), we\r
do not expect tidal disruption to occur, which would re\u0002quire more equal masses or more positive χ1,z (Rantsiou\r
et al. 2008; Shibata & Taniguchi 2008; Etienne et al.\r
2009; Foucart et al. 2011; Kyutoku et al. 2011; Pannar\u0002ale 2013; Foucart et al. 2018).\r
To quantitatively confirm this expectation, we use\r
the spectral representation of equations of state from\r
Abbott et al. (2018a), which uses an SLY low-density\r
crust model (Douchin & Haensel 2001) and parame\u0002terizes the adiabatic index into a polynomial in the\r
logarithm of the pressure (Lindblom 2010; Lindblom\r
& Indik 2012, 2014). Following Stachie et al. (2021),\r
we marginalize the parameter estimation samples from\r
the NSBH analyses over these equations of state. For\r
a fixed equation of state, we compute the maximum\r
Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkov (TOV) mass, allowing us\r
to infer the nature (NS or BH) of the lighter binary\r
compact object, as well as its radius R2, compactness\r
C2 = Gm2/(R2c\r
2\r
) and baryon mass. Based on these,\r
we define a total ejecta mass mej (Fern´andez et al. 2019)\r
as the sum of dynamical ejecta (Kr¨uger & Foucart 2020)\r
and 15% of the mass of disk winds (Foucart et al. 2018).\r
For both events, we find that mej < 10−6M\f for 99% of\r
the samples.\r
The absence of ejecta is compatible with the lack of\r
observed EM counterparts. However, given the large\r
distances of the mergers (' 300 Mpc) and the large un\u0002certainties of their sky localization, EM emission would\r
have been difficult to detect and associate with these\r
GW events.\r

(GW200115) of approximately 134 (38) times smaller\r
than the equivalent phase shift for GW170817. This\r

masses, more asymmetric mass ratios, and the presence\r
of only a single NS. Since p–g effects were not detected\r

maximum mass\r
Even without definite identification of matter signa\u0002tures in the signals, we can compare the observed m2\r
for GW200105 and GW200115 with the maximum NS\r
mass, Mmax. The existence of massive pulsars (Anto\u0002niadis et al. 2013; Cromartie et al. 2019; Fonseca et al.\r
2021) places a lower bound of Mmax & 2 M\f on the\r
maximum NS mass. Studies of GW170817’s remnant\r
typically suggest that the maximum mass of a nonrotat\u0002ing NS—the TOV mass—is Mmax,TOV . 2.3 M\f (e.g.,\r
Shibata et al. 2019; Abbott et al. 2020b; Nathanail et al.\r
2021). However, rapid rotation could support a larger\r
Mmax. Given the considerable uncertainty in Mmax, we\r
examine three different scenarios. Following Essick &\r
Landry (2020), we compute for each scenario the prob\u0002ability p(m2 < Mmax) that the secondary mass is below\r
the maximum NS mass by marginalizing over the uncer\u0002tainty in Mmax and the uncertainty of our m2 measure\u0002ment.\r
Supposing that the secondaries are slowly spinning,\r
we consider in the first row of Table 3 an estimate of\r
Mmax,TOV from a nonparametric astrophysical inference\r
of the equation of state (Landry et al. 2020), which pre\u0002dicts Mmax,TOV = 2.22+0.30\r
−0.20 M\f and is shown in Fig. 4.\r
We then relax the low-spin assumption, estimating in\r
the second row the maximum rotationally supported

13\r
mass Mmax(χ2), and the breakup spin χmax with the\r
universal relations from Breu & Rezzolla (2016). In this\r
scenario, we require m2 ≤ Mmax(χ2) and χ2 ≤ χmax\r
for consistency with an NS. Finally, in the third row,\r
we consider a parametric fit to the entire distribution\r
of observed Galactic NSs, including rapidly rotating\r
pulsars (Farr & Chatziioannou 2020), which predicts\r
Mmax,GNS = 2.25+0.71\r
−0.31 M\f, and is shown in Fig. 4. This\r
scenario accounts for the possibility that the maximum\r
mass in the NS population is limited by the astrophysi\u0002cal processes that form compact binaries. Assuming low\r
spin (first row), we find probabilities of 96% and 98%\r
that the secondaries in GW200105 and GW200115, re\u0002spectively, are consistent with an NS assuming a uniform\r
prior in m2. The possibility of large secondary spin re\u0002duces these probabilities by up to 3% (second and third\r
rows).\r
So far, this analysis has assumed priors that are uni\u0002form in component masses. However, there is consid\u0002erable uncertainty in the astrophysical mass priors of\r
such systems, and different prior assumptions can af\u0002fect the component mass posteriors for detections with\r
moderate S/N. To illustrate the impact of population\r
assumptions, we consider three alternative priors: one\r
based on Salpeter mass distributions, p(m) ∼ m−2.3\r
(Salpeter 1955), independently for each component; one\r
based on an extrapolation of the BBH mass model Bro\u0002ken Power Law from Abbott et al. (2021b) down to"""

similar extrapolation of the Power Law + Peak BBH\r
mass model from the same study. We marginalize over\r
the uncertainties in the latter two models, which are fit\r
to the BBH population from Abbott et al. (2021c), in\u0002cluding the outlier event GW190814 with a secondary\r
component mass below 3 M\f (Abbott et al. 2020d).\r
These different mass priors change the numbers in\r
Table 3 by at most 11%, with the smallest values for\r
GW200105 and GW200115 being 89% and 87%, respec\u0002tively. The decrease is due to the three priors assigning\r
more probability density to equal-mass systems, thus fa\u0002voring larger m2. Thus, the secondaries of both systems\r
are consistent with NSs based on our assumptions about\r
the equation of state and the mass distribution.\r
However, consistency with the maximum NS mass\r
does not exclude the possibility that the secondaries\r
could be BHs or exotic compact objects, if such objects\r
also exist within the NS mass range. For instance, mod\u0002els of primordial BHs predict a peak in the primordial\r

We infer the NSBH merger rate density with our ob\u0002servations using two different approaches.\r
In the first approach, we consider only GW200105\r
and GW200115. Following the method of Kim et al.\r
(2003) as previously used in, e.g., Abbott et al. (2016e,\r
2020d), we calculate an event-based merger rate assum\u0002ing one Poisson-distributed count each from GW200105-\r
and GW200115-like populations. We calculate semian\u0002alytically the search sensitivities across O1, O2, and\r
the first nine months of O3 to NSBH populations cor\u0002responding to the mass and spin posteriors for the\r
two events. We then calibrate these sensitivities to\r
the results of GstLAL (Cannon et al. 2012; Privitera\r
et al. 2014; Messick et al. 2017; Sachdev et al. 2019;\r
Hanna et al. 2020) using a broad NSBH-like popula\u0002tion and an FAR threshold of 1/(2.8 yr). This FAR\r
threshold is chosen to include only GW200105 and\r
GW200115 while excluding low-significance triggers like

14\r
GW190426 152155, though a more conservative thresh\u0002old of 1/(100 yr) as used in, e.g., Abbott et al. (2016e,\r
2020d), changes the estimated sensitivities by less than\r
15%. Applying the Poisson Jeffreys prior proportional\r
to R\r
−1/2\r
i\r
, we find R200105 = 16+38\r
−14 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
, and\r
R200115 = 36+82\r
−30 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. The PyCBC detection of\r
GW200115, using the same method but with an inde\u0002pendent set of injections for calibration (Tiwari 2018),\r
yields a consistent R200115 = 40+92\r
−34 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. Com\u0002bining the likelihoods over R200105 and R200115 accord\u0002ing to Kim et al. (2003) and applying the Jeffreys prior\r
to the total rate, we find the total event-based NSBH\r
merger rate density RNSBH = 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
, plot\u0002ted in green in Fig. 9.\r
The second approach to calculating a merger rate\r
takes into account not only GW200105 and GW200115,\r
but also less significant search triggers with masses con\u0002sistent with the typical range associated with NSBH bi\u0002naries. Specifically, we consider triggers across O1, O2\r
and the first nine months of O3 with associated com\u0002ponent masses m1 ∈ [2.5, 40] M\f and m2 ∈ [1, 3] M\f,\r
i.e. broader ranges than the component mass poste\u0002riors for GW200105 and GW200115 obtained in §4.\r
The cut-off of m2 ≤ 3M\f is chosen as a robust up\u0002per limit on the maximum NS mass (Rhoades & Ruffini\r
1974; Kalogera & Baym 1996). The population is de\u0002fined to be uniformly distributed in comoving volume,\r
uniform in log component masses in the given ranges,\r
with aligned spins with spin magnitudes distributed uni\u0002formly in [0, 0.95]. We use as input GstLAL search\r
triggers above an S/N threshold such that the number\r
of noise triggers exceeds the number of astrophysical sig\u0002nals by a factor ∼100. Following Farr et al. (2015); Ka\u0002padia et al. (2020), we find the resulting joint likelihood\r
on Poisson parameters for signals of each astrophysical\r
category (ΛBNS,ΛNSBH,ΛBBH), and for terrestrial noise\r
triggers Λbackground. Here, the BBH and BNS categories\r
are defined to include triggers where both component\r
masses fall within 5–100 M\f or 1–2.5 M\f, respectively.\r
We apply the Jeffreys prior and recover a merger rate\r
density RNSBH = ΛNSBH/hV TiNSBH, where hV TiNSBH\r
is the population-averaged sensitive time–volume esti\u0002mated using the GstLAL pipeline and the NSBH pop\u0002ulation defined above. This yields an estimated NSBH\r
merger rate density of RNSBH = 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
,\r
the black line in Fig. 9.\r
While this rate is higher than our event-based rate,\r
it considers a wider population that includes addi\u0002tional triggers; for example, the component masses of\r
GW190814 (although the nature of its secondary is un\u0002certain) fall within this population. The calculation is\r
also based on the component mass values of GstLAL\r
search triggers, adjusted with an analytical model (Fong\r
2018) of the response of the template bank to signals\r
with a given distribution of true masses. This procedure\r
is expected to be less precise than Bayesian parameter\r
estimation, which is impractical for the large numbers\r
of triggers involved.\r
The merger rate density measured here is consistent\r
with the upper bound of 610 Gpc−3 yr−1 derived from\r
the absence of NSBH detections in O1 and O2 (Abbott\r
et al. 2019a). Revised merger rate estimates for all CBC\r

observed NSBHs and the wide range of model assump\u0002tions. Merger rates are sensitive to the treatment of\r
common envelopes, which may be a necessary evolu\u0002tionary phase for producing compact binaries in tight

15\r
orbits capable of merging in a Hubble time (Ivanova\r
et al. 2013). They are also sensitive to prescriptions for\r
supernova kick magnitudes. While moderate kicks can\r
produce eccentric orbits that merge on short timescales,\r
high supernova kicks may disrupt the progenitor bina\u0002ries and suppress the merger rate (Belczynski et al. 2002;\r
Giacobbo & Mapelli 2020; Tang et al. 2020).\r
Models of star formation in the dynamical environ\u0002ments of young star clusters predict NSBH merger rate\r
densities of 0.1–100 Gpc−3 yr−1(Fragione & Banerjee\r
2020; Hoang et al. 2020; Rastello et al. 2020; Santoliq\u0002uido et al. 2020). In this scenario, most systems that\r
form merging NSBH (∼80%) are ejected without under\u0002going dynamical exchanges, proceeding to merge in the\r
field.\r
Models of dynamical formation channels in denser en\u0002vironments typically predict much lower merger rates.\r
For instance, in globular clusters and nuclear star clus\u0002ters, BHs segregate and dominate the core, where the\r
bulk of dynamical interactions occur (Portegies Zwart &\r
McMillan 2000; Morscher et al. 2015), so that encounters\r
between NSs and BHs are relatively rare, with NSBH\r
merger rate densities on the order of 10−2 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
(Clausen et al. 2013; Arca Sedda 2020; Ye et al. 2020).\r
In disks of active galactic nuclei, the presence of gas\r
could possibly increase the NSBH merger rate density\r
up to 300 Gpc−3 yr−1(McKernan et al. 2020).\r
NSBHs may also merge via hierarchical triple inter\u0002actions, where inner NSBH binaries are driven to high\r
eccentricity by massive tertiary companions and merge\r
on rapid timescales (Antonini et al. 2017; Silsbee &\r
Tremaine 2017). However, the predicted merger rates\r
are negligible unless supernova kicks are assumed to be\r
zero (Fragione & Loeb 2019).\r
It is likely that a combination of the above channels\r
contribute to the astrophysical NSBH merger rate. How\u0002ever, the isolated binary evolution, young star cluster,\r
and active galactic nuclei channels are capable of indi\u0002vidually accounting for the NSBH merger rate estimated\r
here."""

high-mass population. However, a rigorous association\r
of the events with different components of the NS pop\u0002ulation would require a thorough population analysis.\r
Radio observations of BNS systems do not find such\r
massive NSs, leading to speculation as to the origin of\r
GW190425 (Romero-Shaw et al. 2020; Safarzadeh et al.\r
2020; Galaudage et al. 2021; Mandel et al. 2021). Stel\u0002lar metallicities in the Milky Way are not representative\r
of all populations of GW sources (O’Shaughnessy et al.\r
2008, 2010; Belczynski et al. 2010; Eldridge et al. 2017;\r
Neijssel et al. 2019).\r
The BH masses observed in GW200105 and\r
GW200115 (8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f, respectively)\r
are in line with predictions from population synthesis\r
models for NSBH mergers from isolated binary evolu\u0002tion and young star clusters. In NSBHs, current binary\r
evolution models do not predict BH masses above ' 10\r
M\f (Eldridge et al. 2017; Kruckow et al. 2018; Mapelli &\r
Giacobbo 2018; Broekgaarden et al. 2021), while Popu\u0002lation III NSBHs (Kinugawa et al. 2017) and dynamical\r
interactions in low-metallicity young star clusters allow\r
for higher BH masses (Ziosi et al. 2014; Rastello et al.\r
2020).\r
Electromagnetic observations of X-ray binaries have\r
not uncovered BHs between 3 and 5 M\f, leading to spec\u0002ulation about a mass gap (Ozel et al. ¨ 2010; Farr et al.\r
2011; Kreidberg et al. 2012; Miller & Miller 2014). Anal\u0002ysis of GWTC-2 has also found evidence for a gap or\r
dip in the BH mass spectrum between ∼2.6 and 4 M\f\r
(Fishbach et al. 2020). For GW200115, we find nonneg\u0002ligible support for the primary lying in this mass gap,\r
with p(3 M\f < m1 < 5 M\f) = 30% (27%) under the\r
high-spin (low-spin) priors. This low-mass region is cor\u0002related with negative values of the parallel component\r
of the primary spin; see §6.2.3 below.\r
In summary, the masses inferred for GW200105 and\r
GW200115 are consistent with expectations for NSBHs;\r
their primary masses are in agreement with predictions\r
for BH masses in population synthesis models of the\r
dominant formation scenarios. Meanwhile, their sec\u0002ondary masses are compatible with the observed pop\u0002ulation of Galactic NSs, as well as the masses inferred\r
from GW observations of BNS mergers."""

Spin information encoded in GWs from binaries are\r
a probe of the their evolutionary history (Farr et al.\r
2017, 2018; Stevenson et al. 2017; Talbot & Thrane

16\r
2017; Vitale et al. 2017b; Wysocki et al. 2019). The\r
BHs in binaries are expected to exhibit a range of spin\r
magnitudes and orientations, depending on how they\r
formed (Kalogera 2000; Mandel & O'Shaughnessy 2010;\r
Rodriguez et al. 2016; Liu & Lai 2017, 2018; Antonini\r
et al. 2018; Kruckow et al. 2018; Bavera et al. 2020;\r
Chattopadhyay et al. 2020). The highest dimensionless\r
NS spin implied by pulsar-timing observations of bina\u0002ries that merge within a Hubble time is ∼0.04 (Stovall\r
et al. 2018; Zhu et al. 2018).\r
While the secondary spins of both events reported\r
here are poorly constrained due to the unequal masses,\r
the primary spins of GW200105 and GW200115 can\r
be placed in the context of predictions for BH spins\r
from models of stellar and dynamical evolution and\r
EM observations of NSBH progenitors. As can be seen\r
in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, the primary spins of GW200105\r
and GW200115 are consistent with zero (0.08+0.22\r
−0.08 and\r
0.33+0.48\r
−0.29, respectively), but moderate values of spin are\r
not ruled out. The primary in GW200115 may even have\r
relatively high spin, with a 90% upper limit of 0.72. Sev\u0002eral studies of the observed population of high-mass X\u0002ray binaries (Liu et al. 2008; Gou et al. 2009, 2014; Zhao\r
et al. 2021) find that the BHs have large spins (Valsec\u0002chi et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2012; Qin et al. 2019; Zhao\r
et al. 2021). Given the short lifetime of the secondary,\r
mass transfer is argued to be insufficient to generate BHs\r
with such high spins, implying that the BHs were born\r
with high spins. Belczynski et al. (2011) found that one\r
such high-mass X-ray binary, Cygnus X-1, is expected\r
to form an NSBH with a BH that carries near-maximal\r
spin, although it would not merge within a Hubble time.\r
However, following revised estimates of the component\r
masses of Cygnus X-1 (Miller-Jones et al. 2021), Nei\u0002jssel et al. (2021) found that it will most likely form a\r
BBH. Meanwhile, analyses of GWTC-1 and GWTC-2\r
have found evidence for BH spin (Abbott et al. 2016f;\r
Vitale et al. 2017; Chatziioannou et al. 2019; Kimball\r
et al. 2020; Abbott et al. 2021b), though they do not\r
determine whether those BHs may have been formed\r
with that spin. Altogether, these EM and GW observa\u0002tions of compact binaries and their progenitors suggest\r
a range of BH natal spins in NSBH binaries.\r
Along with their magnitudes, the alignments of com\u0002ponent spins with the overall binary orbital angular mo\u0002mentum are of astrophysical interest. In particular, we\r
find evidence that the primary BH spin in GW200115\r
is negatively aligned with respect to the orbital angular\r
momentum axis, with p(χ1,z < 0) = 88% (87%) under\r
the high-spin (low-spin) prior and with the more neg\u0002ative values of χ1,z correlated with smaller m1. This\r
negative alignment is consistent with dynamical forma\u0002tion channels, which typically form binaries with ran\u0002dom spin orientations (Rodriguez et al. 2016), but the\r
predicted rates from these channels, discussed in §6.2,\r
are small. Binaries born in isolation are expected to\r
form with only small misalignments (. 30°; Kalogera\r
2000), though they may become misaligned by super\u0002nova kicks at compact object formation (Rodriguez et al.\r
2016; Gerosa et al. 2018; Wysocki et al. 2018), and\r
possibly during subsequent evolution via mass transfer\r
(Stegmann & Antonini 2021). Meanwhile, NSBH pro\u0002genitor binaries originating in young star clusters can\r
be perturbed via close dynamical encounters before be\u0002ing ejected into the field. Therefore, a misaligned spin\r
in the primary of GW200115 would not necessarily rule\r
out any of the plausible NSBH formation channels."""

During its third observing run, the LIGO–Virgo GW\r
detector network observed GW200105 and GW200115,\r
two GW events consistent with NSBH coalescences.\r
GW200105 is effectively a single-detector event observed\r
in LIGO Livingston with an S/N of 13.9. It clearly\r
stands apart from all recorded noise transients, but its\r
statistical confidence is difficult to establish. GW200115\r
was observed in coincidence by the network with an S/N\r
of 11.6 and FAR of <1/(1 × 105 yr).\r
The source component masses of GW200105 and\r
GW200115 make it likely that these events originated

17\r
from NSBH coalescences. Their primary masses are\r
found to be m1 = 8.9\r
+1.2\r
−1.5 M\f and m1 = 5.7\r
+1.8\r
−2.1 M\f,\r
which are consistent with predictions of BH masses in\r
population synthesis models for NSBHs. Their sec\u0002ondary masses, inferred to be m2 = 1.9\r
+0.3\r
−0.2 M\f and\r
m2 = 1.5\r
+0.7\r
−0.3 M\f, respectively, are consistent with the\r
observed NS mass distribution in the Milky Way, as well\r
as population synthesis predictions for secondary masses\r
in merging NSBHs.\r
We find no evidence of measurable tides or tidal dis\u0002ruption for either of the two signals, and no EM coun\u0002terparts to either detection have been identified. As\r
such, there is no direct evidence that the secondaries\r
are NSs, and our observations are consistent with either\r
event being a BBH merger. However, the absence of\r
tidal measurements and EM counterparts is to be ex\u0002pected given the properties and distances of the two\r
events. Moreover, the comparisons of the secondary\r
masses to the maximum allowed NS mass yield a proba\u0002bility p(m2 ≤ Mmax) of 89%–96% and 87%–98% for the\r
secondaries in GW200105 and GW200115, respectively,\r
being compatible with NSs (see §5.2).\r
The effective inspiral spin parameter of GW200105 is\r
strongly peaked around zero: χeff = −0.01+0.11\r
−0.15. For\r
the second event, GW200115, the effective inspiral spin\r
parameter is inferred to be χeff = −0.19+0.23\r
−0.35. For\r
GW200115, the spin component parallel to the orbital\r
angular momentum of the primary is χ1,z = −0.19+0.24\r
−0.50,\r
and we find support for negatively aligned primary spin\r
(χ1,z < 0) at 88% probability. More negative values of\r
χ1,z in GW200115 are correlated with particularly small\r
primary masses reaching into the lower mass gap. We\r
find p(3 M\f <m1 <5 M\f) = 30% (27%) under the high\u0002spin (low-spin) parameter estimation priors. We find no\r
conclusive evidence for spin-induced orbital precession\r
in either system.\r
We estimate the merger rate density of NSBH bina\u0002ries with two approaches. Assuming that GW200105\r
and GW200115 are representative of the entire NSBH\r
population, we find RNSBH = 45+75\r
−33 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. Con\u0002versely, assuming a broader range of allowed primary\r
and secondary masses, and considering all triggers in\r
O3, we find RNSBH = 130+112\r
−69 Gpc−3 yr−1\r
. These\r
are the first direct measurements of the NSBH merger\r
rate. Both estimates are broadly consistent with the\r
rate predicted from NSBH formation in isolated bina\u0002ries or young star clusters. Formation channels in dense\r
star clusters (globular or nuclear) and in triples predict\r
lower rates than those inferred from the two events and\r
are unlikely to be the dominant NSBH formation chan\u0002nels.\r
The observations of GW200105 and GW200115 are\r
consistent with predictions for merging NSBHs and ob\u0002servations of BHs and NSs in the Milky Way. Given their\r
significantly unequal component masses, future observa\u0002tions of NSBH systems will provide new opportunities to\r
study matter under extreme conditions, including tidal\r
disruption, and search for potential deviations from GR.\r
