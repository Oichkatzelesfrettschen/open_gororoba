ABSTRACT\r
We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars\r
from the 15-year pulsar-timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for\r
Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings–Downs pattern expected for a stochastic\r
gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power\u0002law–spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 3\r
of 1014, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law–spectrum model with\r
Bayes factors of 200–1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical back\u0002ground distribution for these latter Bayes factors using a method that removes inter-pulsar correlations\r
from our data set, finding p = 10−3(approx. 3σ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation\r
scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of inter-pulsar correlations yields\r
p = 5 × 10−5–1.9 × 10−4(approx. 3.5–4σ). Assuming a fiducial f\r
−2/3\r
characteristic-strain spectrum,\r
as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black-hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is\r
2.4\r
+0.7\r
−0.6 × 10−15 (median + 90% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1 yr−1\r
. The inferred\r
gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations\r
for a signal from a population of supermassive black-hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological\r
and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings–Downs correlations points\r
to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.\r
Keywords: Gravitational waves – Black holes – Pulsars\r
1. INTRODUCTION\r
Almost a century had to elapse between Einstein’s pre\u0002diction of gravitational waves (GWs, Einstein 1916) and\r
their measurement from a coalescing binary of stellar\u0002mass black holes (Abbott et al. 2016). However, their\r
existence had been confirmed in the late 1970s through\r
measurements of the orbital decay of the Hulse–Taylor\r
binary pulsar (Hulse & Taylor 1975; Taylor et al. 1979).\r
Today, pulsars are again at the forefront of the quest to\r
detect GWs, this time from binary systems of central\r
galactic black holes.\r
Black holes with masses of 105–1010 M⊙ exist at the\r
center of most galaxies and are closely correlated with\r
the global properties of the host, suggesting a sym\u0002biotic evolution (Magorrian et al. 1998; McConnell &\r
Ma 2013). Galaxy mergers are the main drivers of hi\u0002erarchical structure formation over cosmic time (Blu\u0002menthal et al. 1984) and lead to the formation of\r
close massive–black-hole binaries long after the mergers\r
(Begelman et al. 1980; Milosavljevi´c & Merritt 2003).\r
The most massive of these (supermassive black-hole bi\u0002naries, SMBHBs, with masses 108–1010 M⊙) emit GWs\r
with slowly evolving frequencies, contributing to a noise\u0002like broadband signal in the nHz range (the GW back\u0002ground, GWB; Rajagopal & Romani 1995; Jaffe &\r
Backer 2003; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Sesana et al. 2004;\r
McWilliams et al. 2014; Burke-Spolaor et al. 2019). If\r
all contributing SMBHBs evolve purely by loss of cir\u0002cular orbital energy to gravitational radiation, the re\u0002sultant GWB spectrum is well described by a simple\r
f\r
−2/3\r
characteristic-strain power law (Phinney 2001).\r

However, GWB signals that are not produced by popu\u0002lations of inspiraling black holes may also lie within the\r
nHz band; these include primordial GWs from inflation,\r
scalar-induced GWs, and GW signals from multiple pro\u0002cesses arising due to cosmological phase transitions, such\r
as collisions of bubbles of the post-transition vacuum\r
state, sound waves, turbulence, and the decay of any\r
defects such as cosmic strings or domain walls that may\r
have formed (see, e.g., Guzzetti et al. 2016; Caprini &\r
Figueroa 2018; Dom`enech 2021, and references therein).\r
The detection of nHz GWs follows the template out\u0002lined by Pirani (1956, 2009), whereby we time the prop\u0002agation of light to measure modulations in the distance\r
between freely falling reference masses. Estabrook &\r
Wahlquist (1975) derived the GW response of electro\u0002magnetic signals traveling between Earth and distant\r
spacecraft, sparking interest in low-frequency GW de\u0002tection. Sazhin (1978) and Detweiler (1979) described\r
nHz GW detection using Galactic pulsars and (effec\u0002tively) the solar system barycenter as references, relying\r
on the regularity of pulsar emission and planetary mo\u0002tions to highlight GW effects. The fact that pulsars\r
are such accurate clocks enables precise measurements\r
of their rotational, astrometric, and binary parameters\r
(and more) from the times-of-arrival of their pulses,\r
which are used to develop ever-refining end-to-end tim\u0002ing models. Hellings & Downs (1983) made the cru\u0002cial suggestion that the correlations between the time\u0002of-arrival perturbations of multiple pulsars could reveal\r
a GW signal buried in pulsar noise; Romani (1989) and\r
Foster & Backer (1990) proposed that a pulsar timing\r
array (PTA) of highly stable millisecond pulsars (Backer\r
et al. 1982) could be used to search for a GWB. Nev\u0002ertheless, the first multi-pulsar, long-term GWB limits\r
were obtained by analyzing millisecond-pulsar residuals\r
independently, rather than as an array (Stinebring et al.\r
1990; Kaspi et al. 1994).

Figure 1. Summary of the main Bayesian and optimal-statistic analyses presented in this paper, which establish multiple lines\r
of evidence for the presence of Hellings–Downs correlations in the 15-year NANOGrav data set. Throughout we refer to the\r
68.3%, 95.4%, and 99.7% regions of distributions as 1/2/3σ regions, even in two dimensions. (a): Bayesian “free-spectrum”\r
analysis, showing posteriors (gray violins) of independent variance parameters for a Hellings–Downs-correlated stochastic process\r
at frequencies i/T, with T the total data set time span. The blue represents the posterior median and 1/2σ posterior bandsa\r
for a power-law model; the dashed black line corresponds to a γ = 13/3 (SMBHB-like) power-law, plotted with the median\r
posterior amplitude. See §3 for more details. (b): Posterior probability distribution of GWB amplitude and spectral exponent\r
in a HD power-law model, showing 1/2/3σ credible regions. The value γGWB = 13/3 (dashed black line) is included in the 99%\r
credible region. The amplitude is referenced to fref = 1 yr−1(blue) and 0.1 yr−1(orange). The dashed blue and orange curves\r
in the log10 AGWB subpanel shows its marginal posterior density for a γ = 13/3 model, with fref = 1 yr−1and fref = 0.1 yr−1,\r
respectively. See §3 for more details. (c): Angular-separation–binned inter-pulsar correlations, measured from 2,211 distinct\r
pairings in our 67-pulsar array using the frequentist optimal statistic, assuming maximum-a-posteriori pulsar noise parameters\r
and γ = 13/3 common-process amplitude from a Bayesian inference analysis. The bin widths are chosen so that each includes\r
approximately the same number of pulsar pairs, and central bin locations avoid zeros of the Hellings–Downs curve. This binned\r
reconstruction accounts for correlations between pulsar pairs (Romano et al. 2021; Allen & Romano 2022). The dashed black\r
line shows the Hellings–Downs correlation pattern, and the binned points are normalized by the amplitude of the γ = 13/3\r
common process to be on the same scale. Note that we do not employ binning of inter-pulsar correlations in our detection\r
statistics; this panel serves as a visual consistency check only. See §4 for more frequentist results. (d): Bayesian reconstruction\r
of normalized inter-pulsar correlations, modeled as a cubic spline within a variable-exponent power-law model. The violins plot\r
the marginal posterior densities (plus median and 68% credible values) of the correlations at the knots. The knot positions are\r
fixed, and are chosen on the basis of features of the Hellings–Downs curve (also shown as a dashed black line for reference): they\r
include the maximum and minimum angular separations, the two zero crossings of the Hellings–Downs curve, and the position\r
of minimum correlation. See §3 for more details.

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 5\r
From a statistical-inference standpoint, the problem\r
of detecting nHz GWs in PTA data is analogous to\r
GW searches with terrestrial and future space-borne\r
experiments, in which the propagation of light be\u0002tween reference masses is modeled with physical and\r
phenomenological descriptions of signal and noise pro\u0002cesses. It is distinguished by the irregular observation\r
times, which encourage a time- rather than Fourier\u0002domain formulation, and by noise sources (intrinsic pul\u0002sar noise, interstellar-medium–induced radio-frequency–\r
dependent fluctuations, and timing-model errors) that\r
are correlated on timescales common to the GWs of in\u0002terest. This requires the joint estimation of GW sig\u0002nals and noise, which is similar to the kinds of global\r
fitting procedures already used in terrestrial GW ex\u0002periments, and proposed for space-borne experiments.\r
GW analysts have therefore converged on a Bayesian\r
framework that represents all noise sources as Gaussian\r
processes (van Haasteren et al. 2009; van Haasteren &\r
Vallisneri 2014), and relies on model comparison (i.e.,\r
Bayes factors, which are ratios of fully marginalized like\u0002lihoods) to define detection (see, e.g., Taylor 2021). This\r
Bayesian approach is nevertheless complemented by null\r
hypothesis testing, using a frequentist detection statis\u0002tic1\r
(the “optimal statistic” of Anholm et al. 2009; De\u0002morest et al. 2013; Chamberlin et al. 2015) averaged\r
over Bayesian posteriors of the noise parameters (Vige\u0002land et al. 2018).\r
The GWB—rather than GW signals from individu\u0002ally resolved binary systems—is likely to become the\r
first nHz source accessible to PTA observations (Rosado\r
et al. 2015). Because of its stochastic nature, the GWB\r
cannot be identified as a distinctive phase-coherent sig\u0002nal in the way of individual compact-binary-coalescence\r
GWs. Rather, as PTA data sets grow in extent and\r
sensitivity one expects to first observe the GWB as ex\u0002cess low-frequency residual power of consistent ampli\u0002tude and spectral shape across multiple pulsars (Ro\u0002mano et al. 2021; Pol et al. 2021). An observation fol\u0002lowing this behavior was reported in 2020 (Arzoumanian\r
et al. 2020, henceforth NG12gwb) for the 12.5-year data\r
set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observa\u0002tory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav, McLaughlin\r
2013; Ransom et al. 2019), and then confirmed (Gon\u0002charov et al. 2021a; Chen et al. 2021) by the Parkes\r
Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA, Manchester et al. 2013)\r
and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA, Desvi\u0002gnes et al. 2016), following many years of null results\r
and steadily decreasing upper limits on the GWB am\u00021 See Jenet et al. (2006) for an early example of a cross-correlation\r
statistic for PTA GWB detection.\r
plitude. A combined International Pulsar Timing Ar\u0002ray (IPTA, Perera et al. 2019) data release consisting of\r
older data sets from the constituent PTAs also confirmed\r
this observation (Antoniadis et al. 2022). Nevertheless,\r
the finding of excess power cannot be attributed to a\r
GWB origin merely by the consistency of amplitude and\r
spectral shape, which could arise from intrinsic pulsar\r
processes of similar magnitude (Goncharov et al. 2022;\r
Zic et al. 2022), or from a common systematic noise such\r
as clock errors (Tiburzi et al. 2016). Instead, definitive\r
proof of GW origin is sought by establishing the pres\u0002ence of phase-coherent inter-pulsar correlations with the\r
characteristic spatial pattern derived by Hellings and\r
Downs (1983, henceforth HD): for an isotropic GWB,\r
the correlation between the GW-induced timing delays\r
observed at Earth for any pair of pulsars is a universal,\r
quasi-quadrupolar function of their angular separation\r
in the sky. Even though this correlation pattern is mod\u0002ified if there is anisotropy in the GWB—which may be\r
the case for a GWB generated by a SMBHB population\r
(Mingarelli et al. 2013; Taylor & Gair 2013; Cornish &\r
Sesana 2013; Mingarelli & Sidery 2014; Mingarelli et al.\r
2017; Roebber & Holder 2017)—the HD template is ef\u0002fective for detecting even anisotropic GWBs in all but\r
the most extreme scenarios (Cornish & Sesana 2013;\r
Cornish & Sampson 2016; Taylor et al. 2020; B´ecsy et al.\r
2022; Allen 2023).\r
In this letter we present multiple lines of evidence\r
for an excess low-frequency signal with HD correlations\r
in the NANOGrav 15-year data set (Figure 1). Our\r
key results are as follows. The Bayes factor between\r
an HD-correlated, power-law GWB model and a spa\u0002tially uncorrelated common-spectrum power-law model\r
ranges from 200 to 1,000, depending on modeling choices\r
(Figure 2). The noise-marginalized optimal statistic,\r
which is constructed to be selectively sensitive to HD\u0002correlated power, achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼ 5\r
(Figure 3 and Figure 4). We calibrated these detection\r
statistics by removing correlations from the 15-year data\r
set using the phase-shift technique, which removes inter\u0002pulsar correlations by adding random phase shifts to the\r
Fourier components of the common process (Taylor et al.\r
2017). We find false-alarm probabilities of p = 10−3 and\r
p = 5 × 10−5for the observed Bayes factor and optimal\r
statistic, respectively (see Figure 3).\r
For our fiducial power-law model (f\r
−2/3\r
for charac\u0002teristic strain and f\r
−13/3\r
for timing residuals) and a\r
log-uniform amplitude prior, the Bayesian posterior of\r
GWB amplitude at the customary reference frequency\r
1 yr−1is AGWB = 2.4\r
+0.7\r
−0.6 × 10−15 (median with 90%\r

See panel (b) of Figure 1 for AGWB and γ posteriors.\r
The posterior for γ is consistent with the value of 13/3\r
predicted for a population of SMBHBs evolving by GW\r
emission, although smaller values of γ are preferred;\r
however, the recovered posteriors are consistent with\r
predictions from astrophysical models (see Agazie et al.\r
2023a). We also note that, unlike our detection statistics\r
(which are calibrated under our modeling assumptions),\r
the estimation of γ is very sensitive to minor details in\r
the data model of a few pulsars.\r
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We\r
briefly describe our data set and data model in §2. Our\r
main results are discussed in detail in §3 and §4; they\r
are supported by a variety of robustness and validation\r
studies, including a spectral analysis of the excess sig\u0002nal (§5.2), a correlation analysis that finds no signif\u0002icant evidence for additional spatially correlated pro\u0002cesses (§5.3), and cross-validation studies with single\u0002telescope data sets and leave-one-pulsar-out techniques\r
(§5.4). In the past two years we have performed an end\u0002to-end review of the NANOGrav experiment, to iden\u0002tify and mitigate possible sources of systematic error or\r
data set contamination: our improvements and consider\u0002ations are partly described in a set of companion papers:\r
on the NANOGrav statistical analysis as implemented\r
in software (Johnson et al. 2023), on the 15-year data\r
set (Agazie et al. 2023b, hereafter NG15), and on pulsar\r
models (Agazie et al. 2023c, hereafter NG15detchar).\r
More companion papers address the possible SMBHB\r
(Agazie et al. 2023a) and cosmological (Afzal et al. 2023)\r
interpretations of our results, with several more GW\r
searches and signal studies in preparation. We look for\u0002ward to the cross-validation analysis that will become\r
possible with the independent data sets collected by\r
other IPTA members.\r
2. THE 15-YEAR DATA SET AND DATA MODEL\r
The NANOGrav 15-year data set2(NG15) con\u0002tains observations of 68 pulsars obtained between July\r
2004 and August 2020 with the Arecibo Observatory\r
2 While the time between the first and last observations we analyze\r
is 16.03 years, this data set is named “15-year data set” since no\r
single pulsar exceeds 16 years of observation; we will use this\r
nomenclature despite the discrepancy.\r
(Arecibo), the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the\r
Very Large Array (VLA), augmenting the 12.5-year data\r
set (Alam et al. 2021a,b) with 2.9 years of timing data\r
for the 47 pulsars in the previous data set, and with\r
21 new pulsars3. For this paper we analyze narrow\u0002band times of arrival (TOAs), which are computed sep\u0002arately for sub-bands of each receiver, and focus on\r
the 67 pulsars with a timing baseline ≥ 3 years. We\r
adopt the TT(BIPM2019) timescale and the JPL DE440\r
ephemeris (Park et al. 2021), which improves Jupiter’s\r
orbit with ranging and VLBI observations of the Juno\r
spacecraft. Uncertainties in the Jovian orbit impacted\r
NANOGrav’s 11-year GWB search (Arzoumanian et al.\r
2018; Vallisneri et al. 2020), but they are now negligible.\r
For each pulsar, we fit the TOAs to a timing model\r
that includes pulsar spin period, spin period derivative,\r
sky location, proper motion, and parallax. While not\r
all pulsars have measurable parallax and proper mo\u0002tion, we always include these parameters because they\r
induce delays with the same frequencies for all pulsars\r
(f = 0.5 yr−1for parallax and f = yr−1 plus a lin\u0002ear envelope for proper motion), so there is a risk that\r
a parallax or proper motion signal could be misidenti\u0002fied as a GW signal. Fitting for these parameters in all\r
pulsars reduces our sensitivity to GWs at those frequen\u0002cies; however, this effect is minimal for GWB searches\r
since these frequencies are much higher than the fre\u0002quencies at which we expect the GWB to be signifi\u0002cant. For binary pulsars, the timing model includes also\r
five orbital elements for binary pulsars and additional\r
non-Keplerian parameters when these improve the fit as\r
determined by an F test. We fit variations in disper\u0002sion measure as a piecewise constant “DMX” function\r
(Arzoumanian et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2017). The in\u0002dividual analysis of each pulsar provides best-fit esti\u0002mates of the timing residuals δt, of white measurement\r
noise, and of intrinsic red noise, modeled as a power\r
law (Cordes 2013; Lam et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2017).4\r
White measurement noise is described by three param\u0002eters: a linear scaling of TOA uncertainties (“EFAC”),\r
white noise added to the TOA uncertainties in quadra\u0002ture (“EQUAD”), and noise common to all sub-bands\r
at the same epoch (“ECORR”), with independent pa\u0002rameters for every receiver/backend combination (see\r
NG15detchar). We summarize white noise by its maxi\u0002mum a posteriori (MAP) covariance C. See App. A for\r
more details of our instruments, observations, and data\u00023 The data set is available at data.nanograv.org with the code used\r
to process it.\r
4 Throughout the paper we use “red noise” to describe noise whose\r
power spectrum decreases with increasing frequency.

reduction pipeline: a complete discussion of the data set\r
can be found in NG15.\r
In our Bayesian GWB analysis, we model δt as a fi\u0002nite Gaussian process consisting of time-correlated fluc\u0002tuations that include intrinsic red pulsar noise and (po\u0002tentially) a GW signal, along with timing-model uncer\u0002tainties (van Haasteren et al. 2009; van Haasteren &\r
Vallisneri 2014; Taylor 2021). The red noise is mod\u0002eled with Fourier basis F and amplitudes c (Lentati\r
et al. 2013). All Fourier bases (the columns of F) are\r
sines and cosines computed on the TOAs with frequen\u0002cies fi = i/T, where T = 16.03 yr is the TOA ex\u0002tent. The timing-model uncertainties are modeled with\r
design-matrix basis M and coefficients ϵ. The single\u0002pulsar log likelihood is then\r

\u0003\r
, (1)\r
with\r
r = δt − F c − Mϵ. (2)\r
The prior for the ϵ is taken to be uniform with infinite\r
extent, so the posterior is driven entirely by the like\u0002lihood. The set of the {c} for all pulsars take a joint\r
normal prior with zero mean and covariance\r
⟨caicbj ⟩ = δij (δabφai + Φab,i) ; (3)\r
here a, b range over pulsars and i, j over Fourier com\u0002ponents; δij is Kronecker’s delta. The term φai de\u0002scribes the spectrum of intrinsic red noise in pulsar\r
a, while Φab,i describes processes with common spec\u0002trum across all pulsars and (potentially) phase-coherent\r
inter-pulsar correlations. The {c} prior ties together the\r
single-pulsar likelihoods (Equation 1) into a joint pos\u0002terior, p(c, ϵ, η|δt) ∝ p(δt|c, ϵ)p(c, ϵ|η)p(η), where we\r
have dropped subscripts to denote the concatenation of\r
vectors for all pulsars, and where η denotes all the hy\u0002perparameters (such as red-noise and GWB power spec\u0002trum amplitudes) that determine the covariances. We\r
marginalize over c and ϵ analytically, and use Markov\r
chain Monte Carlo techniques (see App. B) to estimate\r
p(η|δt) for different models of the intrinsic red noise and\r
common spectrum.\r
The data-model variants adopted in this paper all\r
share this probabilistic setup, but differ in the struc\u0002ture and parametrization of Φab,i. For a model with\r
intrinsic red noise only (henceforth irn), Φab,i = 0;\r
for common-spectrum spatially-uncorrelated red noise\r
(curn), Φab,i = δabΦCURN,i; for an isotropic GWB with\r
Hellings–Downs correlations (hd), Φab,i = Γ(ξab)ΦHD,i,\r

In NG12gwb we established strong Bayesian evidence for\r

for the GWB from a stationary ensemble of inspiraling\r
binaries, and refer to that fiducial model as hd13/3. For\r
specific “free spectrum” studies we will instead model\r
the individual ΦCURN,i or ΦHD,i elements, and refer to\r
models curnfree and hdfree. Throughout this article we\r
use frequencies fi = i/T with i = 1–30 for intrinsic noise\r
(f = 2–59 nHz), covering a frequency range over which\r
pulsar noise transitions from red-noise–dominated to\r
white–noise-dominated. For common-spectrum noise,\r
we limit the frequency range in order to reduce corre\u0002lations with excess white noise at higher frequencies.\r
Following NG12gwb, we fit a curnγ model enhanced\r
with a power-law break to our data, and limit fre\u0002quencies to the MAP break frequencies (i = 1–14 or\r
f = 2–28 nHz; see App. C).\r

Figure 2. Bayes factors between models of correlated red noise in the NANOGrav 15-year data set (see §5.3 and App. B). All\r
models feature variable-γ power laws. curnγis vastly favored over irn (i.e., we find very strong evidence for common-spectrum\r
excess noise over pulsar intrinsic red-noise alone); hdγis favored over curnγ(i.e., we find positive evidence for Hellings–Downs\r
correlations in the common-spectrum process); dipole and monopole processes are strongly disfavored with respect to curnγ;\r
adding correlated processes to hdγis disfavored. While the interpretation of “raw” Bayes factors is somewhat subjective, they\r
can be given a statistical significance within the hypothesis-testing framework by computing their background distributions and\r
deriving the p-values of the observed factors, e.g., Figure 3.\r
stochastic signal with common amplitude and spec\u0002trum across pulsars5\r
. The joint AHD– γHD Bayesian\r
posterior is shown in panel (b) of Figure 1, with 1-D\r
marginal posteriors in the horizontal and vertical sub\u0002plots. The posterior medians and 5–95% quantiles are\r
AHD = 6.4\r
+4.2\r
−2.7 × 10−15 and γHD = 3.2\r
+0.6\r
−0.6\r
. The thicker\r
curve in the vertical subplot is the AHD posterior for\r
the hd13/3 model, for which AHD,13/3 = 2.4\r
+0.7\r
−0.6 ×10−15\r
.\r
These amplitudes are compatible with astrophysical ex\u0002pectations of a GWB from inspiraling SMBHBs (see\r
§6). The AHD posterior has essentially no support below\r
10−15.\r
The strong AHD– γHD correlation is an artifact of us\u0002ing the conventional frequency fref = 1 yr−1\r
in Equa\u0002tion 6, and it largely disappears when fref is moved to\r
the band of greatest PTA sensitivity; see the dashed con\u0002tours in panel (b) of Figure 1 for fref = (10 yr)−1\r
. The\r
γHD posterior is in moderate tension with the theoretical\r
universal binary-inspiral value γHD = 13/3, which lies at\r
the 99% credible boundary: smaller values of γHD could\r
be an indication that astrophysical effects, such as stellar\r
scattering and gas dynamics, play a role in the evolution\r
of SMBHBs emitting GWs in this frequency range (see\r
§6 and Agazie et al. 2023a). This highlights the impor\u0002tance of measuring this parameter. Furthermore, its es\u0002timation is sensitive to details in the modeling of intrin\u0002sic red noise and of interstellar-medium timing delays in\r
a few pulsars (see the analysis in §5.2). Notably, in the\r
12.5-year data set γHD = 13/3 was recovered at ∼ 1σ\r
below the median (NG12gwb); this anomaly is reversed\r
in the newer data set. It is likely that more expansive\r

the calculation of Bayes factors.\r
data sets or more sophisticated chromatic noise models,\r
e.g., next generation Gaussian process models such as\r
in §5.1 (Goncharov et al. 2021b; Chalumeau et al. 2022;\r
Lam et al. 2018), will be needed to infer the presence of\r
possible systematic errors in γHD.\r
Our Bayesian analysis provides evidence that the\r
common-spectrum signal includes Hellings–Downs inter\u0002pulsar correlations. Specifically, the Bayes factor be\u0002tween the hdγ and curnγ models ranges from 200 (when\r
14 Fourier frequencies are included in Φi) to 1,000 (when\r
5 frequencies are included, as in NG12gwb). Results\r
are similar for hd13/3 vs. curn13/3. Figure 2 recapitu\u0002lates Bayes factors between a variety of models, includ\u0002ing some with the alternative spatial-correlation struc\u0002tures discussed in §5.3. The very peaked AHD posterior\r
in panel (b) of Figure 1, significantly separated from\r
smaller amplitudes, supports the very large Bayes fac\u0002tor between irn and curnγ\r
. The 15-year data set fa\u0002vors hdγ over curnγ\r
, and over models with monopolar\r
or dipolar correlations, and it is inconclusive about, i.e.,\r
gives roughly even odds for, the presence of spatially\r
correlated signals in addition to hdγ.\r
We can also regard the hdγ vs. curnγ Bayes factor as\r
a detection statistic in a hypothesis-testing framework,\r
and derive the p-value of the observed Bayes factor with\r
respect to its empirical distribution under the curnγ\r
model. We do so by computing Bayes factors on 5,000\r
bootstrapped data sets where inter-pulsar spatial corre\u0002lations are removed by introducing random phase shifts,\r
drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 2π, to\r
the common-process Fourier components (Taylor et al.\r
2017). This procedure alters inter-pulsar correlations to\r
have a mean of zero, while leaving the amplitudes of in\u0002trinsic pulsar noise and CURN unchanged, thus provid-

only compute 5,000 Bayesian phase shifts, compared to 400,000 optimal statistic phase shifts, because of the huge computational\r
resources needed to perform the Bayesian analyses. For the optimal statistic, we also compute the background distribution using\r
27,000 simulations (orange line) and compare to an analytic calculation (green line). Dotted lines indicate Gaussian-equivalent\r
2σ, 3σ, and 4σ thresholds. The dashed vertical lines indicate the values of the detection statistics for the unshifted data sets.\r
For the Bayesian analyses, we find p = 10−3(approx. 3σ); for the optimal statistic analyses, we find p = 5 × 10−5–1.9 × 10−4\r
(approx. 3.5–4σ).\r
ing a way to test the null hypothesis that no inter-pulsar\r
correlations are present. The resulting background dis\u0002tribution of Bayes factors is shown in the left panel of\r
Figure 3—they exceed the observed value in five of the\r
5,000 phase shifts (p = 10−3). We also performed sky\r
scramble analyses (Cornish & Sampson 2016), which\r
remove the dependence of inter-pulsar spatial correla\u0002tions on the angular separations between the pulsars by\r
attributing random sky positions to the pulsars. Sky\r
scrambles generate a background distribution for which\r
inter-pulsar correlations are present in the data but they\r
are independent of the pulsars’ angular separations: for\r
this distribution, we find p = 1.6×10−3. A detailed dis\u0002cussion of sky scrambles and the results of these analyses\r
can be found in App. F.\r
As in NG12gwb, we also carried out a minimally mod\u0002eled Bayesian reconstruction of the inter-pulsar correla\u0002tion pattern, using spline interpolation over seven spline\u0002knot positions. The choice of seven spline-knot posi\u0002tions is based on features of the Hellings–Downs pattern:\r
two correspond to the maximum and minimum angular\r
separations (0◦ and 180◦, respectively), two are chosen\r
to be at the theoretical zero crossings of the Hellings–\r
Downs pattern (49.2\r
◦ and 121.8◦\r
), one is at the theo\u0002retical minimum (82.5\r
◦\r
), and the final two are between\r
the end points and zero crossings (25◦ and 150◦) to al\u0002low additional flexibility in the fit. Panel (d) of Fig\u0002ure 1 shows the marginal 1-D posterior densities at these\r
spline-knot positions for a power-law varied-exponent\r
model. The reconstruction is consistent with the over\u0002plotted Hellings–Downs pattern; furthermore, the joint\r
2-D marginal posterior densities for the knots, not shown\r
in panel (d) of Figure 1, at the HD zero-crossings is con\u0002sistent with (0, 0) within 1σ credibility.\r
4. OPTIMAL STATISTIC ANALYSIS\r
We complement our Bayesian search with a frequen\u0002tist analysis using the optimal statistic (Anholm et al.\r
2009; Demorest et al. 2013; Chamberlin et al. 2015), a\r
summary statistic designed to measure correlated excess\r
power in PTA residuals. (Note that there is no accepted\r
definition of “optimal statistic” in modern statistical us\u0002age, but the term has become established in the PTA\r
literature to refer to this specific method, so we use it\r
for this reason.) It is enlightening to describe the op\u0002timal statistic as a weighted average of the inter-pulsar\r
correlation coefficients\r

This equation represents the optimal estimator of the\r
HD amplitude A2; it can also be interpreted as the\r
best-fit Aˆ2 obtained by least-squares–fitting the ρab to\r
the Hellings–Downs model Aˆ2 Γ(ξab). Because Aˆ2is a\r
function of intrinsic–red-noise and common-process hy\u0002perparameters through the Pa, we use the results of\r
an initial Bayesian-inference run to refer the statistic to\r
MAP hyperparameters, or to marginalize it over their\r
posteriors. As discussed in Vigeland et al. (2018), we\r
obtain more accurate values of the amplitude by this\r
marginalization.\r
To search for inter-pulsar correlations using the op\u0002timal statistic, we evaluate the frequency (the p-value)\r
with which an uncorrelated common-spectrum process\r
with parameters estimated from our data set would yield\r
Aˆ2 greater than we observe. In the absence of a signal,\r
the expectation value of Aˆ2is zero, and its distribution\r
is approximately normal. Thus we divide the observed\r
Aˆ2 by its standard deviation to define a formal signal\u0002to-noise ratio\r

Figure 4 shows the distribution of this S/N over curnγ\r
and curn13/3 noise-parameter posteriors, with S/Ns of\r
5 ± 1 and 4 ± 1, respectively (means ± standard de\u0002viations across noise-parameter posteriors). We use 14\r
frequency components to model the signal: the depen\u0002dence on the number of frequency components is very\r
weak.\r
Because the distribution of Aˆ2\r
is only approximately\r
normal (Hazboun et al. 2023), the S/N of Equation 11\r
does not map analytically to a p-value, and it cannot\r
be interpreted as a “sigma” level. Instead, optimal\u0002statistic p-values can be computed empirically by re\u0002moving inter-pulsar correlations from the 15-year data\r
set with phase shifts (Taylor et al. 2017). We draw ran\u0002dom phase offsets from 0 to 2π for the common-process\r
Fourier components, which is equivalent to making uni\u0002form draws from the background distribution of CURN,\r
and ask how often a random choice of phase offsets\r
produces a HD-correlated signal. The right panel of\r
Figure 3 shows the distribution of noise-marginalized\r
S/N over 400,000 phase shifts. There are 19 phase\r
shifts with noise-marginalized S/N greater than ob\u0002served, with p = 5 × 10−5\r
. We compare the phase-shift\r
distribution with backgrounds obtained by simulation\r
(right panel of Figure 3, orange line) and analytic calcu\u0002lation (green line). For the former, we simulate 27,000\r
curnγrealizations using MAP hyperparameters from\r
the 15-yr data and compute the optimal-statistic S/N for\r
each; for the latter, we evaluate the generalized χ\r
2 dis\u0002tribution (Hazboun et al. 2023) with median curnγ hy\u0002perparameters. Although neither method includes the\r
marginalization over noise-parameter posteriors, we find\r
good agreement with phase shifts, with p = 1.8 × 10−4\r
from simulations, and p = 1.9 × 10−4from the analytic\r
calculation. Finally, we use sky scrambles to compute\r
the p-value for the null hypothesis that inter-pulsar cor\u0002relations are present, but they have no dependence on\r
the angular separation between the pulsars, for which\r
we find p < 10−4(see App. F).\r
Averaging the cross-correlations ρab in angular\u0002separation bins with equal numbers of pulsar pairs re\u0002veals the Hellings–Downs pattern, as shown in panel\r
(c) of Figure 1 for 15 bins. The ρab were evalu\u0002ated with MAP curn13/3 noise parameters. The black\r
dashed curve traces the expected correlations for an HD\u0002correlated background with the MAP amplitude; the\r
vertical error bars display the expected 1σ spreads of the\r
binned cross-correlations, accounting for the ⟨ρabρcd⟩\r
covariances induced by the HD-correlated process (Ro\u0002mano et al. 2021; Allen & Romano 2022). (Neglecting\r
those covariances yields 20–40% smaller spreads. Note\r
that they are not included in p-value estimates because\r
those are calculated under the null hypothesis of no spa\u0002tially correlated process.)\r
Although each draw from the noise-parameter poste\u0002rior would generate a slightly different plot, as would\r
different binnings, the quality of the fit seen in Fig\u0002ure 1 provides a visual indication that the excess low\u0002frequency power in the 15-year data set harbors HD\r
correlations. The χ\r
2\r
for this 15-bin reconstruction with\r
respect to the Hellings–Downs curve is 8.1, where we ac\u0002count for ρab covariance in constructing the bins, and the\r
covariance between bins in constructing the χ\r
2\r
(Allen &\r
Romano 2022). This corresponds to a p-value of 0.75,

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 11\r
calculated using simulations based on the hdγ model, or\r
0.92 if one assumes this value follows a canonical χ\r
2 with\r
15 degrees of freedom. These p-values are representative\r
of what we find with different binnings: we find p > 0.3\r
when using eight to 20 bins (assuming a canonical χ\r
2\r
distribution).\r
5. CHECKS AND VALIDATION\r
Prior to analyzing the 15-year data set, we extensively\r
reviewed our data collection and analysis procedures,\r
methods, and tools, in an effort to eliminate contamina\u0002tion from systematic effects and human error. Further\u0002more, the results presented in §3 and §4 are supported\r
by a variety of consistency checks and auxiliary stud\u0002ies. In this section we present those that offer evidence\r
for or against the presence of HD correlations, reveal\r
anomalies, or otherwise highlight features of note in the\r
data: alternative DM modeling (§5.1), the spectral con\u0002tent (§5.2) and correlation pattern (§5.3) of the excess\u0002noise signal, as well as the consistency of our findings\r
across data set “slices,” pulsars, and telescopes (§5.4).\r
5.1. Alternative DM models\r
In this paper and in previous GW searches (e.g.,\r
NG12gwb), we model fluctuations in the DM using\r
DMX parameters (a piecewise-constant representation,\r
see NG15). Adopting this DM model as the standard\r
makes it easier to directly compare the results here to\r
those in NG12gwb. An alternative model where DM\r
variations are modeled as a Fourier-domain Gaussian\r
process, DMGP, has been used by Antoniadis et al.\r
(2022), Chen et al. (2021), and Goncharov et al. (2021a).\r
The Fourier coefficients follow a power law similar to\r
those of intrinsic and common-spectrum red noise, but\r
their basis vectors include a ν\r
−2\r
radio-frequency depen\u0002dence, and the component frequencies fi = i/T range\r
through i = 1–100. Under the DMGP model we also in\u0002clude a deterministic solar-wind model (Hazboun et al.\r
2022) and the two chromatic events in PSR J1713+0747\r
reported in Lam et al. (2018) which are modeled as de\u0002terministic exponential dips with the chromatic index\r
quantifying the radio-frequency dependence of the dips\r
left as a free parameter. If these chromatic events are\r
not modeled, they raise estimated white noise (Hazboun\r
et al. 2020). A detailed discussion of chromatic noise ef\u0002fects can be found in NG15detchar.\r
Using the DMGP model in place of DMX has minimal\r
effects on nearly all pulsars in the array. Only PSRs\r
J1713+0747 and J1600−3053 show notable differences\r
in their recovered intrinsic-noise parameters. However,\r
DMGP does affect the parameter estimation of common\r
red noise, as seen in Figure 5, shifting the posterior for\r

making it more consistent with γCURN = 13/3.\r
γ to higher values that are more consistent with 13/3.\r
Despite this, we still recover HD correlations at the same\r
significance as when we use DMX to model fluctuations\r
in the DM, implying that the evidence reported for the\r
presence of correlations in this work is independent of\r
the choice of DM noise modeling.\r
5.2. Spectral analysis\r
Adopting power-law spectra for curn and hd is a\r
useful simplification that reduces the number of fit pa\u0002rameters and yields more informative constraints; fur\u0002thermore, it is expedient to identify hd13/3 with the\r
hypothesis that we are observing the GWB from SMB\u0002HBs. Nevertheless, the standard γ = 13/3 power law\r
for GW inspirals may be altered by astrophysical pro\u0002cesses such as stellar and gas friction in nuclei (see, e.g.,\r
Merritt & Milosavljevi´c 2005 for a review), by apprecia\u0002ble eccentricity in SMBHB orbits (Enoki & Nagashima\r
2007), and by low-number SMBHB statistics (Sesana\r
et al. 2008). hdγ parameter recovery may also be biased\r
if intrinsic pulsar noise is not modeled well by a power\r
law. Indeed, our data show hints of a discrepancy from\r
the idealized hd13/3 model: the γHD posterior in panel\r
(b) of Figure 1 favors slopes much shallower than 13/3,\r
and the hdγ-to-curnγ Bayes factor drops from 1,000 to\r
200 when Fourier components at more than five frequen\u0002cies are included in the model.\r
We examine the spectral content of the 15-year data\r
set using the curnfree and hdfree models, which are\r
parametrized by the variances of the Fourier components\r
at each frequency. Their marginal posteriors are shown\r
in the left panel of Figure 6, where bin number i cor\u0002responds to fi = i/T, with T = 16.03 yr the extent of\r
the data set. For the purpose of illustration, we overlay\r
best-fit power laws that thread the posteriors in a way

at their corresponding frequencies fi = i/T with T the 16.03-yr extent of the data set. Excess power is observed in bins 1–8\r
(somewhat marginally in bin 6); Hellings–Downs-correlated power in bins 1–5 and 8. The dashed line plots the best-fit power\r
law, which has γ ≃ 3.2 (as in panel (d) of Figure 1); the fit is pushed to lower γ by bins 1 and 8. The dotted line plots the best-fit\r
power law when γ is fixed to 13/3; it overshoots in bin 1 and undershoots in bin 8. Right: Posteriors of variance Φ2 in Fourier\r
bin 2 (f2 = 3.95 nHz) in a curnfree + hdfree + monopolefree + dipolefree model, showing evidence of a quasi-monochromatic\r
monopole process (dashed). No monopole or dipole power is observed in all other bins of that joint model, with ΦCURN,i and\r
ΦHD,i posteriors consistent with the left panel.\r
similar to the factorized PTA likelihood of Taylor et al.\r
(2022) and Lamb et al. (2023).\r
We deem excess power, either uncorrelated for\r
curnfree or correlated for hdfree, to be observed in a\r
bin when the support of the posterior is concentrated\r
away from the lowest amplitudes. No power of either\r
kind is observed above f8, consistent with the presence\r
of a floor of white measurement noise. Furthermore,\r
no correlated power is observed in bins 6 and 7, where a\r
power-law model would expect a smooth continuation of\r
the trend of bins 1–5 (cf. the dashed fit of Figure 6): this\r
may explain the drop in the Bayes factor. However, cor\u0002related power reappears in bin 8, pushing the fit toward\r
shallower slopes. Indeed, repeating the fit by omitting\r
subsets of the bins suggests that the low recovered γHD\r
is due mostly to bin 8 and to the lower-than-expected\r
correlated power found in bin 1. Obviously, excluding\r
those bins leads to higher γHD estimates.\r
To explore deviations from a pure power law that may\r
arise from statistical fluctuations of the astrophysical\r
background or from unmodeled systematics (perhaps re\u0002lated to the timing model), in App. D we relax the nor\u0002mal ck prior (cf. Equation 3) to a multivariate Student’s\r
t-distribution that is more accepting of mild outliers.\r
The resulting estimate of γCURN peaks at a higher value\r
and is broader than in curnγ, with posterior medians\r
and 5-95% quantiles of γCURN = 3.5\r
+1.0\r
−1.0\r
.\r
Similarly, spectral turnovers due to interactions be\u0002tween SMBHBs and their environments can result in\r
reduced GWB power at lower frequencies, which might\r
explain the slightly lower correlated power in bin 1. We\r
investigate this hypothesis in App. E using the turnover\r
spectrum of Sampson et al. (2015). For this curnturnover\r
model, the 15-year data favor a spectral bend below 10\r
nHz (near f5), but the Bayes factor against the standard\r
hdγis inconclusive.\r
Future data sets with longer time spans and the com\u0002parison of our data set with those of other PTAs should\r
help clarify the astrophysical or systematic origin of\r
these possible spectral features.\r
5.3. Alternative correlation patterns\r
Sources other than GWs can produce inter-pulsar\r
residual correlations with spatial patterns other than\r
HD. For example, errors in the solar-system ephemerides\r
create time-dependent Roemer delays with dipolar cor\u0002relations (Roebber 2019; Vallisneri et al. 2020), and er\u0002rors in the correction of telescope time to an inertial\r
timescale (Hobbs et al. 2012, 2020) create an identical\r
time-dependent delay for all pulsars (i.e., a delay with\r
monopolar correlations).\r
Gair et al. (2014) showed that, for a pulsar array dis\u0002tributed uniformly across the sky, HD correlations can\r
be decomposed as\r
ΓHD,ab =\r
X∞\r
l=0\r

g0 = 0, g1 = 0, gl =\r
3\r
2\r
(2l + 1)(l − 2)!\r
(l + 2)! for l ≥ 2, (12)\r
where the Pl(cos ξab) are Legendre polynomials of order\r
l evaluated at the pulsar angular separation ξab. In other\r
words, a HD-correlated signal should have no power at\r
l = 0 or l = 1.

gl over curnγ noise-parameter pos\u0002teriors. The black dashed line shows the Legendre spectrum\r
of a pure-HD signal, with the median posterior Aˆ2\r
HD.\r
We can perform a frequentist generic correlation\r
search using Legendre polynomials6 with the multiple\u0002component optimal statistic (MCOS; Sardesai & Vige\u0002land 2023)—a generalized statistic that allows multiple\r
correlation patterns to be fit simultaneously to the cor\u0002relation coefficients ρab. Figure 7 shows the constraints\r
on A2\r
l = A2\r
gl obtained by fitting the correlations ρab to\r
this Legendre series using the MCOS and marginalizing\r
over curnγ noise-parameter posteriors. The quadrupo\u0002lar structure of the data is evident, along with a small\r
but significant monopolar contribution.\r
The same feature from the Legendre decomposition\r
appears if we use the MCOS to search for multiple cor\u0002relations simultaneously: a multiple regression analy\u0002sis favors models that contain both significant HD and\r
monopole correlations (see App. G). From simulations\r
of 15-year-like data sets (see App. H.1), we find a p\u0002value of 0.11 (approx. 2σ) for observing a monopole at\r
this significance or higher with a pure-HD injection of\r
amplitude similar to what we observe. We also per\u0002form a model-checking study to assess whether the ob\u0002served monopole is consistent with the hd13/3 model\r
(see App. H.2), and we find a p-value of 0.11 for pro\u0002ducing an apparent monopole when the signal is purely\r
hd13/3. Thus, we conclude that it is possible for a HD\u0002correlated signal to appear to have monopole correla\u0002tions in an optimal statistic analysis at this significance\r
level.\r
6 A Bayesian method for fitting correlations using Legendre poly\u0002nomials can be found in Nay et al. (2023).\r
In contrast, Bayesian searches for additional correla\u0002tions do not find evidence of additional monopole- or\r
dipole-correlated red noise processes: as shown in Fig\u0002ure 2, the Bayes factors for these processes are ∼ 1. We\r
also perform a general Bayesian search for correlations\r
using a curnfree + hdfree + monopolefree + dipolefree\r
model, which allows for independent uncorrelated and\r
correlated components at every frequency bin. We note\r
that this analysis is more flexible than the ones described\r
above, which assume a power-law power spectral den\u0002sity. We find no significant dipole-correlated power at\r
any frequency, and we find monopole-correlated power\r
only in the second frequency bin (f2 = 3.95 nHz); pos\u0002teriors of variance for that bin are shown in the right\r
panel of Figure 6.\r
Motivated by this finding, we perform a search for hdγ\r
+ sinusoid, which includes a deterministic sinusoidal\r
delay (applied to all pulsars alike, as appropriate for a\r
monopole) with free frequency, amplitude, and phase.\r
The sinusoid’s posteriors match the free-spectral analy\u0002sis in frequency and amplitude; however, the Bayes fac\u0002tor between hdγ + sinusoid and hdγ\r
calculated using\r
two methods (Hee et al. 2015; Hourihane et al. 2023),\r
is only ∼ 1, so the signal cannot be considered statis\u0002tically significant. Astrophysically motivated searches\r
for sources that produce sinusoidal or sinusoid-like de\u0002lays in the residuals, such as an individual SMBHB or\r
perturbations to the local gravitational field induced by\r
fuzzy dark matter (Khmelnitsky & Rubakov 2014), also\r
yield Bayes factors ∼ 1. Thus we conclude that there\r
is some evidence of additional power at 3.95 nHz with\r
monopole correlations; however, the significance in the\r
Bayesian analyses is low, while the optimal-statistic S/N\r
could be produced by a HD-correlated signal. There\u0002fore, we cannot definitively say whether the signal is\r
present, or determine the source. We note that per\u0002forming an MCOS analysis after subtracting off real\u0002izations of a sinusoid using hdγ + sinusoid posteri\u0002ors reduces the (S/N)monopole ≃ 0 while (S/N)HD re\u0002mains unchanged, indicating that this single-frequency\r
monopole-correlated signal is likely causing the nonzero\r
monopole signal observed in the MCOS analysis.\r
Similar hints of a monopolar signal (though weaker)\r
were found in the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, unsur\u0002prisingly given that it is a subset of the current data set.\r
To exercise due diligence, we audited the correction of\r
telescope time to GPS time at the Arecibo Observatory\r
and at the Green Bank Telescope, and found nothing\r
that could explain our observations. The subsequent\r
steps in the time-correction pipeline rely on very accu\u0002rate atomic clocks and are unlikely to introduce consid\u0002erable systematics (Petit 2022). An important test will

14 The NANOGrav Collaboration\r
be whether this signal persists in future data sets. If this\r
monopolar feature is a truly an astrophysical signal, we\r
would expect it to increase in significance as our data\r
set grows. Comparisons with other PTAs and combined\r
IPTA data sets will also provide crucial insight.\r
5.4. Dropout and cross-validation\r
The GWB is by its nature a signal affecting all of the\r
pulsars in the PTA, although it may appear more signif\u0002icant in some based on their observing time span, noise\r
properties, and on the particular realization of pulsar\r
and Earth contributions (Speri et al. 2023). One way\r
to assess the significance of the GWB in each pulsar is\r
a Bayesian dropout analysis (Aggarwal et al. 2019; Ar\u0002zoumanian et al. 2020), which introduces a binary pa\u0002rameter that turns on and off the common signal (or its\r
inter-pulsar correlations) for a single pulsar, leaving all\r
other pulsars unchanged. The Bayes factor associated\r
with this parameter, also referred to as the “dropout\r
factor,” describes how much each pulsar likes to “par\u0002ticipate” in the common signal.\r
Figure 8 plots curnγ vs. irn dropout factors for all\r
67 pulsars (blue). We find positive dropout factors (i.e.,\r
dropout factors > 2) for an uncorrelated common pro\u0002cess in twenty pulsars, while only one has a dropout\r
factor < 0.5. For comparison, in the NANOGrav 12.5-\r
year data set ten pulsars showed positive dropout fac\u0002tors for an uncorrelated common process, while three\r
had negative dropout factors. We also show HD corre\u0002lations vs. curnγ dropout factors (orange). For these,\r
the uncorrelated common process is always present in\r
all pulsars, but the cross-correlations for all pulsar pairs\r
involving a given pulsar may be dropped from the like\u0002lihood. We find positive factors for HD correlations vs.\r
curnγin seven pulsars, while three are negative. We\r
expect more pulsars to have positive dropout factors for\r
curnγ vs. irn than for Hellings–Downs vs. curnγ be\u0002cause the Bayes factor comparing the first two models\r
is significantly higher than the one comparing the sec\u0002ond two models (see Figure 2). Negative dropout factors\r
could be caused by noise fluctuations or they could be\r
an indication that more advanced chromatic noise mod\u0002eling is necessary (Alam et al. 2021a). They could also\r
be caused by the GWB itself, which induces both corre\u0002lated and uncorrelated noise in the pulsars (the so-called\r
“Earth terms” and “pulsar terms”; Mingarelli & Min\u0002garelli 2018).\r
In addition to Bayes factors, the goodness-of-fit of\r
probabilistic models can be evaluated by assessing their\r
predictive performance (Gelman et al. 2013). Specifi\u0002cally, given that the GWB is correlated across pulsars,\r
we can (partially) predict the timing residuals δta of\r

among pulsars with long observation times, but overall more\r
pulsars favor curnγ participation and hdγcorrelations than\r
disfavor them.\r
pulsar a from the residuals δt−a of all other pulsars by\r
way of the “leave-one-out” posterior predictive likelihood\r
(PPL)\r
p(δta|δt−a) = Zdθa p(δta|θa) p(θa|δt−a), (13)\r
where θa are all the parameters and hyperparameters\r
that affect pulsar a in a given model. As discussed in\r
Meyers et al. (2023), we compare the predictive perfor\u0002mance of curn13/3 and hd13/3\r
for each pulsar in turn\r
by taking the ratio of the corresponding leave-one-out\r
PPLs. These ratios are closely related to the dropout\r
factors plotted in Figure 8. Multiplying the PPL ratios\r
for all pulsars yields the pseudo Bayes factor (PBF).\r
For the 15-year data set we find PBF15 yr = 1,400 in\r
favor of hd13/3 over curn13/3. The PBF does not have\r
a “betting odds” interpretation, but we obtain a crude\r
estimate of its significance by building its background\r
distribution on 40 curn13/3simulations with the MAP\r
log10 ACURN inferred from the 15-year data set. For all\r
simulations except one, the PBF favors the null hypoth\u0002esis, and log10 PBF15 yr is displaced by approx. three\r
standard deviations from the mean log10 PBF.\r
A different sort of cross-validation relies on evaluating\r
the optimal statistic for temporal subsets of the data\r
set, as in Hazboun et al. (2020). In the regime where

Number of pulsars\r
Figure 9. S/N growth as a function of time and number of\r
pulsars. As we move from left to right we add an additional\r
six months of data at each step. New pulsars are added\r
when they accumulate three years of data. The blue violin\r
plot shows the distribution of the optimal statistic S/N over\r
curnγ noise parameters. The dashed orange line shows the\r
number of pulsars used for each time slice.\r
the lowest frequencies of our data are dominated by the\r
GWB, the optimal statistic S/N should grow with the\r
square root of the time span of the data and linearly\r
with the number of pulsars in the array (Siemens et al.\r
2013); in this regime increasing the number of pulsars is\r
the best way to boost PTA sensitivity to the GWB. To\r
verify that this is indeed the case, we analyze “slices”\r
of the data set in six-month increments, starting from\r
a six-year data set. Once a new pulsar accumulates\r
three years of data, we add it to the array. We per\u0002form a separate Bayesian curnγ analysis for each slice\r
and calculate the Hellings–Downs optimal statistic over\r
the noise-parameter posterior. In Figure 9, we plot the\r
S/N distributions against time span and the number of\r
pulsars. As expected, we observe essentially monotonic\r
growth associated with the increase in the number of\r
pulsars.\r
The signal should also be consistent between tim\u0002ing observations made with Arecibo and GBT. To test\r
this, we analyze the two split-telescope data sets (see\r
App. A); both show evidence of common-spectrum ex\u0002cess noise. Figure 10 shows Arecibo (orange) and GBT\r
(green) curnγ posteriors, which are broadly consistent\r
with each other and with full-data posteriors (blue).\r
Arecibo yields log10 A = −14.02+0.18\r
−0.22 and γ = 2.78+0.70−0.64\r
(medians with 68% credible intervals), while GBT yields\r
log10 A = −14.2\r
+0.15\r
−0.17 and γ = 3.37+0.40\r

The split-telescope data sets are significantly less sen\u0002sitive to spatial correlations than the full data set, be\u0002cause they have fewer pulsars and therefore pulsar pairs\r
(see Figure 12 of App. A). Nevertheless, we can search\r
them for spatial correlations using the optimal statis\u0002tic. We find a noise-marginalized Hellings–Downs S/N\r

The posteriors for the split-telescope data sets are consistent\r
with each other and with the posteriors for the full data set.\r
of 2.9 for Arecibo and 3.3 for GBT, consistent with the\r
split-telescope data sets having about half the number\r
of pulsars as the full data set. The S/Ns for Arecibo\r
and GBT are comparable: while telescope sensitivity,\r
observing cadence, and distribution of pulsars all affect\r
GWB sensitivity, the dominant factor is the number of\r
pulsars because the S/N scales linearly with the num\u0002ber of pulsars but only as ∝ (σ\r
√\r
c)\r
−1/γ, where σ is the\r
residual root-mean-squared, and c is the observing ca\u0002dence (Siemens et al. 2013). We also note that the dis\u0002tributions of angular separations probed by Arecibo and\r
GBT are similar, although GBT observes more pulsar\r
pairs with large angular separations (see Figure 12).\r
6. DISCUSSION\r
In this letter we have reported on a search for an\r
isotropic stochastic GWB in the 15-year NANOGrav\r
data set. A previous analysis of the 12.5-year\r
NANOGrav data set found strong evidence for ex\u0002cess low-frequency noise with common spectral prop\u0002erties across the array, but inconclusive evidence for\r
Hellings–Downs inter-pulsar correlations, which would\r
point to the GW origin of the background. By con\u0002trast, the 12.5-year data disfavored purely monopo\u0002lar (clock-error–like) and dipolar (ephemeris-error–like)\r
correlations. Subsequent independent analyses by the\r
PPTA and EPTA collaborations reported results con\u0002sistent with ours (Goncharov et al. 2021a; Chen et al.\r
2021), as did the search of a combined data set (Anto\u0002niadis et al. 2022)—a syzygy of tantalizing discoveries\r
that portend the rise of low-frequency GW astronomy.\r
We analyzed timing data for 67 pulsars in the 15-year\r
data set (those that span > 3 years), with a total time\r
span of 16.03 years, and more than twice the pulsar pairs\r
than in the 12.5-year data set. The common-spectrum\r
stochastic signal gains even greater significance and is

16 The NANOGrav Collaboration\r
detected in a larger number of pulsars. For the first time,\r
we find compelling evidence of Hellings–Downs inter\u0002pulsar correlations, using both Bayesian and frequen\u0002tist detection statistics (see Figure 1), with false-alarm\r
probabilities of p = 10−3 and p = 5 × 10−5–1.9 × 10−4,\r
respectively (see Figure 3).\r
The significance of Hellings–Downs correlations in\u0002creases as we increase the number of frequency com\u0002ponents in the analysis up to five, indicating that the\r
correlated signal extends over a range of frequencies.\r
A detailed spectral analysis supports a power-law sig\u0002nal, but at least two frequency bins show deviations\r
that may skew the determination of spectral slope (Fig\u0002ure 6). These discrepancies may arise from astrophysi\u0002cal or systematic effects. Furthermore, slope determi\u0002nation changes significantly using an alternative DM\r
model (Figure 5). The study of spatial correlations with\r
the optimal statistic confirms a Hellings–Downs quasi\u0002quadrupolar pattern (Figure 7 and panel c of Figure 1),\r
with some indications of an additional monopolar signal\r
confined to a narrow frequency range near 4 nHz. How\u0002ever, the Bayesian evidence for this monopolar signal is\r
inconclusive, and we could not ascribe it to any astro\u0002physical or terrestrial source (e.g., an individual SMBHB\r
or errors in the chain of timing corrections).\r
The GWB is a persistent signal that should increase in\r
significance with number of pulsars and observing time\r
span. This is indeed what we observe by analyzing slices\r
of the data set (see Figure 9). Furthermore, the signal is\r
present in multiple pulsars (Figure 8), and can be found\r
in independent single-telescope data sets (Figure 10).\r
We are preparing a number of other papers searching\r
the 15-year data set for stochastic and deterministic sig\u0002nals, including an all-sky, all-frequency search for GWs\r
from individual circular SMBHBs. This search, together\r
with the same analysis of the 12.5-year data set (Arzou\u0002manian et al. 2023), indicates that the spectrum and\r
correlations we observe cannot be produced by an indi\u0002vidual circular SMBHB.\r
If the Hellings–Downs-correlated signal is indeed an\r
astrophysical GWB, its origin remains indeterminate.\r
Among the many possible sources in the PTA frequency\r
band, numerous studies have focused on the unresolved\r
background from a population of close-separation SMB\u0002HBs. The SMBHB population is a direct byproduct\r
of hierarchical structure formation, which is driven by\r
galaxy mergers (e.g., Blumenthal et al. 1984). In a\r
post-merger galaxy, the SMBHs sink to the center of\r
the common merger remnant through dynamical inter\u0002actions with their astrophysical environment, eventually\r
leading to the formation of a binary (Begelman et al.\r
1980). GW emission from a SMBHB at nHz frequencies\r
is quasi-monochromatic because the binaries evolve very\r
slowly. Under the assumption of purely GW-driven bi\u0002nary evolution, the expected characteristic-strain spec\u0002trum is ∝ f\r
−2/3\r
(or f\r
−13/3\r
for pulsar-timing residuals).\r
The GWB spectrum may also feature a low-frequency\r
turnover induced by the dynamical interactions of bi\u0002naries with their astrophysical environment (e.g., with\r
stars or gas, see Armitage & Natarajan 2002; Sesana\r
et al. 2004; Merritt & Milosavljevi´c 2005) or possibly by\r
non-negligible orbital eccentricities persisting to small\r
separations (Enoki & Nagashima 2007). We find little\r
support for a low-frequency turnover in our data (see\r
App. E).\r
The GWB amplitude is determined primarily by\r
SMBH masses and by the occurrence rate of close bi\u0002naries, which in turn depends on the galaxy merger\r
rate, the occupation fraction of SMBHs, and the binary\r
evolution timescale; population models predict ampli\u0002tudes ranging over more than an order of magnitude\r
(Rajagopal & Romani 1995; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Jaffe\r
& Backer 2003; McWilliams et al. 2014; Sesana 2013),\r
under a variety of assumptions. Figure 11 displays a\r
comparison of hdγ parameter posteriors with power-law\r
spectral fits from an observationally constrained semi\u0002analytic model of the SMBHB population constructed\r
with the holodeck package (Kelley et al. 2023). This\r
particular set of SMBHB populations assumes purely\r
GW-driven binary evolution, and uses relatively nar\u0002row distributions of model parameters based on liter\u0002ature constraints from galaxy-merger observations (see,\r
e.g., Tomczak et al. 2014). While the amplitude recov\u0002ered in our analysis is consistent with models derived\r
directly from our understanding of SMBH and galaxy\r
evolution, it is toward the upper end of predictions im\u0002plying a combination of relatively high SMBH masses\r
and binary fractions. A detailed discussion of the GWB\r
from SMBHBs in light of our results is given in Agazie\r
et al. (2023a).\r
In addition to SMBHBs, more exotic cosmological\r
sources such as inflation, cosmic strings, phase transi\u0002tions, domain walls, and curvature-induced GWs can\r
also produce detectable GWBs in the nHz range (see,\r
e.g., Guzzetti et al. 2016; Caprini & Figueroa 2018, and\r
references therein). Similarities in the spectral shapes of\r
cosmological and astrophysical signals make it challeng\u0002ing to determine the origin of the background from its\r
spectral characterization (Kaiser et al. 2022). The ques\u0002tion could be settled by the detection of signals from\r
individual loud SMBHBs or by the observation of spa\u0002tial anisotropies, since the anisotropies expected from\r
SMBHBs are orders of magnitude larger than those pro\u0002duced by most cosmological sources (Caprini & Figueroa

2018; Bartolo et al. 2022). We discuss these models in\r
the context of our results in Afzal et al. (2023).\r
The EPTA and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA;\r
Joshi et al. 2018), PPTA, and Chinese Pulsar Timing\r
Array (CPTA; Lee 2016) collaborations have also re\u0002cently searched their most recent data for signatures of\r
a gravitational-wave background (Antoniadis et al. 2023;\r
Reardon et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2023), and an upcoming\r
IPTA paper will compare the results of these searches.\r
The IPTA’s forthcoming Data Release 3 will combine\r
the NANOGrav 15-year data set with observations from\r
the EPTA, PPTA, and InPTA collaborations, compris\u0002ing about 80 pulsars with time spans up to 24 years, and\r
offering significantly greater sensitivity to spatial cor\u0002relations and spectral characteristics than single-PTA\r
data sets. Future PTA observation campaigns will im\u0002prove our understanding of this signal and of its astro\u0002physical and cosmological interpretation. Longer data\r
sets will tighten spectral constraints on the GWB, clar\u0002ifying its origin (Pol et al. 2021). Greater numbers of\r
pulsars will allow us to probe anisotropy in the GWB\r
(Pol et al. 2022) and its polarization structure (see, e.g.,\r
Arzoumanian et al. 2021, and references therein). The\r
observation of a stochastic signal with spatial correla\u0002tions in PTA data, suggesting a GWB origin, expands\r
the horizon of GW astronomy with a new Galaxy-scale\r
observatory sensitive to the most massive black-hole sys\u0002tems in the Universe and to exotic cosmological pro\u0002cesses.\r

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 23\r
APPENDIX\r
A. ADDITIONAL DATA SET DETAILS\r
The observations included in the NANOGrav 15-year\r
data set were performed between July 2004 and August\r
2020 with the 305-m Arecibo Observatory (Arecibo), the\r
100-m Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and, since 2015,\r
the 27 25-m antennae of the Very Large Array (VLA).\r
We used Arecibo to observe the 33 pulsars that lie within\r
its declination range (0◦ < δ < +39◦); GBT to ob\u0002serve the pulsars that lie outside of Arecibo’s range,\r
plus J1713+0747 and B1937+21, for a total of 36 pul\u0002sars; the VLA to observe the seven pulsars J0437−4715,\r
J1600−3053, J1643−1224, J1713+0747, J1903+0327,\r
J1909−3744, and B1937+21. Six of these were also ob\u0002served with Arecibo, GBT, or both; J0437−4715 was\r
only visible to the VLA. Figure 12 shows the sky loca\u0002tions of the 67 pulsars used for the GWB search (top)\r
and the distribution of angular separations for the pulsar\r
pairs (bottom).\r
Initial observations were performed with the ASP\r
(Arecibo) and GASP (GBT) systems, with 64-MHz\r
bandwidth (Demorest 2007). Between 2010 and 2012,\r
we transitioned to the PUPPI (Arecibo) and GUPPI\r
(GBT) systems, with bandwidths up to 800 MHz (Du\u0002Plain et al. 2008; Ford et al. 2010). We observe pulsars\r
in two different radio-frequency bands in order to mea\u0002sure pulse dispersion from the interstellar medium: at\r
Arecibo, we use the 1.4 GHz receiver plus either the 430\r
MHz or 2.1 GHz receiver (and the 327 MHz receiver for\r
early observations of J2317+1439); at GBT, we use the\r
820 MHz and 1.4 GHz receivers; at the VLA, we use the\r
1.4 GHz and 3 GHz receivers with the YUPPI system.\r
In §5.4 we analyze also two split-telescope data sets:\r
33 pulsars for Arecibo, and 35 for GBT (excluding\r
J0614−3329, which was observed for less than three\r
years). For the two pulsars timed by both telescopes\r
(J1713+0747 and B1937+21), we partition the timing\r
data between the telescopes and obtain independent\r
timing solutions for each. We do not analyze a VLA-only\r
data set, which would have shorter observation spans\r
and significantly reduced sensitivity.\r
B. BAYESIAN METHODS & DIAGNOSTICS\r
The prior probability distributions assumed for all\r
analyses in this paper are listed in Table 1. We use\r
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sam\u0002ple randomly from the joint posterior distribution of our\r
model parameters. Marginal distributions are obtained\r
simply by considering only the parameter of interest 16h 12h 8h 4h\r

observed the pulsar. Bottom: Distribution of angular sepa\u0002rations probed by the pulsars in the full data set (orange),\r
the Arecibo data set (blue), and the GBT data set (red).\r
Because Arecibo and GBT mostly observed pulsars at differ\u0002ent declinations, there are few inter-telescope pairs at small\r
angular separations, resulting in a deficit of pairs for the full\r
data set in the first bin.\r
in each sample. To assess convergence of our MCMC\r
runs beyond visual inspection we use the Gelman–Rubin\r
statistic, requiring R <ˆ 1.01 for all parameters (Gelman\r
& Rubin 1992; Vehtari et al. 2021). We performed most\r
runs discussed in this paper with the PTMCMC sampler\r
(Ellis & van Haasteren 2017) and postprocessed sam\u0002ples with chainconsumer (Hinton 2016).\r
In NG12gwb we use an analytic approximation for the\r
uncertainty of marginalized-posterior statistics (Wilcox\r
2012). Here we instead adopt a boostrap approach:\r
we resample the original MCMC samples (with replace\u0002ment) to generate new sets that act as independent sam\u0002pling realizations. We then calculate the distributions of\r
the desired summary statistics (e.g., quantiles, marginal\u0002ized posterior values) over these sets. From these distri\u0002butions, we determine central values and uncertainties\r
(either medians and 68% confidence intervals, or means\r
and standard deviations).

We rely on a variety of techniques to perform Bayesian\r
model comparison. The first is thermodynamic integra\u0002tion (e.g., Ogata 1989; Gelman & Meng 1998), which\r
computes Bayesian evidence integrals directly through\r
parallel tempering: we run Nβ MCMC chains that ex\u0002plore variants of the likelihood function raised to dif\u0002ferent exponents β, then approximate the evidence for\r
model H as\r
ln p(d|H) = Z 1\r
0\r
⟨ln p(d|θ)⟩β dβ ≈\r
1\r
Nβ\r
X\r
β\r
⟨ln p(d|θ)⟩β,\r
(B1)\r
where all likelihoods and posteriors are computed\r
within model H, θ denotes all of the model’s parame\u0002ters, and the expectation ⟨ln p(d|θ)⟩β is approximated\r
by MCMC with respect to the posterior pβ(θ|d) ∝\r
p(d|θ, H)\r
βp(θ, H). The inverse temperatures β are\r
spaced geometrically, as is the default in PTMCMC.\r
To compare nested models, which differ by “freezing”\r
a subset of parameters, we also use the Savage–Dickey\r
density ratio (Dickey 1971): if models H and H0 differ\r
by the fact that (say) θ0 is frozen to 0 in the latter, then\r
p(d|H0)/p(d|H) = p(θ0 = 0|d, H)/p(θ0 = 0|H).\r
When comparing disjoint models with different like\u0002lihoods (e.g., hd versus curn), we use product-space\r
sampling (Carlin & Chib 1995; Godsill 2001). This\r
method treats model comparison as a parameter estima\u0002tion problem, where we sample the union of the unique\r
parameters of all models, plus a model-indexing param\u0002eter that activates the relevant likelihood function and\r
parameter space of one of the sub-models. Bayes fac\u0002tors are then obtained by counting how often the model\r
index falls in each activation region and taking ratios of\r
those counts.\r
In some situations, it can be difficult to sample a com\u0002putationally expensive model directly. In these cases,\r
we sample a computationally cheaper approximate dis\u0002tribution and reweight those posterior samples to es\u0002timate the posterior for the computationally expensive\r
model (Hourihane et al. 2023). The reweighted poste\u0002rior can be used in the thermodynamic-integration or\r
Savage–Dickey methods. In addition, the mean of the\r
weights yields the Bayes factor between the expensive

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 25\r
and approximate models, which may be of direct interest\r
(e.g., hd can be approximated by curn). We estimate\r
Bayes-factor uncertainties using bootstrapping and, for\r
product-space sampling, with the Markov-model tech\u0002niques of Cornish & Littenberg (2015) and Heck et al.\r
(2019).\r
C. BROKEN POWER-LAW MODEL\r
As shown in NG12gwb, the simultaneous Bayesian es\u0002timation of white measurement noise and of red-noise\r
processes described by power laws biases the recovery\r
of the spectral index of the latter (Lam et al. 2017;\r
Hazboun et al. 2019). Just as in NG12gwb and An\u0002toniadis et al. (2022), we impose a high-frequency cutoff\r
on the red-noise processes. To choose the cutoff fre\u0002quency, we perform inference on our data with a curnγ\r
model modified so that the common process has power\r
spectral density\r

ref ;\r
(C2)\r
then set the cutoff to the MAP fbreak. Equation C2 is\r
fairly generic, allowing for separate spectral indices at\r
low (γ) and high (δ) frequencies. The break frequency\r
fbreak dictates where the broken power law changes spec\u0002tral index, while ℓ (which we set to 0.1) controls the\r
smoothness of the transition.\r
The marginal posterior for fbreak, obtained in the\r
factorized-likelihood approximation using the tech\u0002niques of Lamb et al. (2023), has median and 90% cred\u0002ible region of 3.2\r
+5.4\r
−1.2 × 10−8 Hz, and a MAP value of\r
2.75 × 10−8 Hz. The latter is close to f14 = 14/T in our\r
frequency basis (with T the total span of the data set),\r
so we use 14 frequencies to model common-spectrum\r
noise processes (see §2 and NG12gwb).\r
D. T-PROCESS SPECTRUM MODEL\r
The free-spectrum analysis of our data (§5.2 and Fig\u0002ure 6) shows that the frequency bins at f1, f6, f7, and\r
f8 appear to be in tension with a pure power law, skew\u0002ing the estimation of γ and reducing the hd13/3 vs.\r
curn13/3 Bayes factor. Assuming that those frequency\r
components reflect unmodeled systematics or stronger\u0002than-expected statistical fluctuations, we can make our\r
inference more robust to such outliers with a “fuzzy”\r
power-law model that allows the individual Φi to vary\r
more freely around their expected values. To wit, we\r
introduce the t-process spectrum (TPS)\r
ΦTPS,i = xiΦpowerlaw,i with x ∼ invgamma(xi; 1, 1),\r
(D3)\r
where Φpowerlaw,i follows Equation 6 and x follows the\r
inverse gamma distribution with parameters α = β = 1;\r
the resulting Gaussian mixture yields a Student’s-t dis\u0002tribution for the ΦTPS,i. Figure 13 shows curnγ power\u0002law posteriors and curnTPS modified power-law posteri\u0002ors, obtained in the factorized-likelihood approximation\r
(Taylor et al. 2022; Lamb et al. 2023) and compared\r
to curnfree bin variances. The TPS model is spread\r
more widely and deviates from the perfect power law at\r
bins f1, f6, f7, and f8, as expected. The right panel of\r
Figure 13 shows the joint log10 A, γ posteriors for curnγ\r
and curnTPS. The latter is more consistent with steeper\r
power laws, and it includes γ = 13/3 at 1σ credibility.\r
E. TURNOVER MODEL\r
The final parameterized spectral model that we in\u0002vestigate is motivated by the idea that the dynamics\r
of SMBHBs are influenced by their environments at\r
sub-parsec separations (Armitage & Natarajan 2002;\r
Sesana et al. 2004; Merritt & Milosavljevi´c 2005). These\r
interactions affect binary evolution and the resulting\r
spectrum of the GWB. The process of bringing two\r
SMBHs together after galaxy mergers involves a com\u0002plex chain of interactions: despite significant theoretical\r
work, the lack of observational constraints makes it dif\u0002ficult to draw any conclusions. PTAs, however, provide\r
a unique opportunity to probe the timescale over which\r
two SMBHs evolve from the merger of their galaxies to\r
a bound binary that produces GW signals in the PTA\r
sensitivity band.\r
When dynamical interactions dominate orbital evo\u0002lution, binaries will traverse the GW spectrum more\r
quickly, reducing GW emission compared to a GW\u0002driven inspiral. This kind of behavior is captured by\r
the turnover model (Sampson et al. 2015):\r
S(f) = A2\r

ref . (E4)\r
This is qualitatively similar to the broken power law dis\u0002cussed earlier, except that here f0 represents the GW\r
frequency at which typical binary evolution transitions\r
from environmentally dominated (at lower frequencies\r
and wider separations) to GW-dominated (at higher fre\u0002quencies and smaller separations). The parameter κ\r
controls the shape of the spectrum below f0, and de\u0002pends on the orbital-evolution mechanism. Note that\r
the actual turning point of the spectrum is not at f0\r
but at fbend = f0 × (3κ/4 − 1)1/κ (NG9gwb).\r
Applying this model to our data, we find hints of de\u0002partures from a pure power law: the transition frequency\r
f0 lies below 10 nHz with 65% credibility, while the\r
bend frequency lies below 10 nHz with 75% credibility.

“fuzzy” t-process allows local deviations from a perfect power law, producing wider constraints that are more consistent with\r
γ = 13/3 (dashed line).\r
Nevertheless, Bayesian comparison of this curnturnover\r
model with curnγreports an inconclusive Bayes fac\u0002tor of 1.46±0.02 in favor of curnturnover. Furthermore,\r
the estimation of curnturnover parameters is sensitive to\r
DM modeling (see §5.1). While the spectra are broadly\r
consistent whether we use DMX or DMGP to model DM\r
fluctuations, there are differences in the power at certain\r
frequencies that lead to differences in the turnover pa\u0002rameters. This is discussed in greater detail in Agazie\r
et al. (2023a).\r
F. SKY SCRAMBLES\r
In the sky-scramble method (Cornish & Sampson\r
2016), inter-pulsar correlations are analyzed as if the\r
pulsars occupied random sky positions, with the purpose\r
of creating a background distribution of PTA detection\r
statistics for null-hypothesis testing, in alternative to\r
phase shifts (Taylor et al. 2017; see §3 and §4). If a cor\u0002related signal is present in the data, phase shifts and sky\r
scrambles actually test different null hypotheses: phase\r
shifts test the hypothesis that no inter-pulsar correla\u0002tions are present, while sky scrambles assume that inter\u0002pulsar correlations are present at the level measured in\r
the data, but test the hypothesis that these correlations\r
have no dependence on angular separation.\r
As is the convention in the literature, we require that\r
scrambled overlap reduction functions (ORFs) be inde\u0002pendent of each other and of the unscrambled ORF us\u0002ing a match statistic,\r
M¯ =\r

, (F5)\r
where Γab and Γ′\r
ab are two different ORFs. For the\r
sky scrambles used in our analysis, the scrambled ORFs\r
have M < ¯ 0.1 with respect to the unscrambled ORF,\r
and M < ¯ 0.17 with each other. We generate 10,000\r
sky scrambles, owing to the difficulty in obtaining large\r
numbers of scrambled ORFs that satisfy the match\r
threshold; because of limitations of computational re\u0002sources, we obtain our detection statistics for 5,000 of\r
those ORFs. Figure 14 shows the resulting background\r
distributions for the hdγ-to-curnγ Bayes factor (left\r
panel) and the optimal-statistic S/N (right panel). The\r
Bayes factors exceed the observed value in eight of the\r
5,000 sky scrambles (p = 1.6 × 10−3), while none of\r
the sky scrambles have noise-marginalized mean S/N\r
greater than observed (p < 10−4).\r
We note that the null distribution recovered by the\r
sky scrambles is not very sensitive to the choice of\r
match threshold for |M¯ | ≲ 0.2. Figure 15 compares\r
the null distributions when the match threshold for all\r
ORFs with each other and with the unscrambled ORF\r
is set to |M¯ | < 0.17 (blue), |M¯ | < 0.1 (orange), and\r
|M¯ | < 0.08 (green). There is very little difference among\r
the distributions; however, imposing a smaller thresh\u0002old means that fewer sky scrambles can be used (6,043\r
with |M¯ | < 0.1 and 1,534 with |M¯ | < 0.08, compared\r
to 10,000 with |M¯ | < 0.17), which limits the precision\r
with which the p-value can be measured. We find no\r
evidence that the recovered null distribution is biased\r
when including sky scrambles with matches up to 0.17.

Note—All values were computed for the 15-year data set, assuming a power-law power spectral density using the 14 lowest\r

in parentheses represent the mean least-squares errors for the Aˆ2\r
k coefficients and standard deviations over noise-parameter\r
posteriors for S/Ns. We compute p(AIC) with respect to the model with the lowest mean AIC (i.e., HD + monopole).\r
G. MULTIPLE-CORRELATION OPTIMAL\r
STATISTIC\r
The multiple-correlation optimal statistic (MCOS;\r
Sardesai & Vigeland 2023) fits the inter-pulsar corre\u0002lation coefficients ρab with a linear model that includes\r
multiple components with different correlation patterns,\r
but with the same spectral shape. The linear-model co\u0002efficients are the squared amplitudes of the components.\r
Within such a model, the significance of each component\r
can be quoted as a S/N given by its best-fit coefficient di\u0002vided by the fit error. Just as for the noise-marginalized\r
optimal statistic (Vigeland et al. 2018), the posterior\r
distribution of pulsar noise parameters induces a distri\u0002bution of MCOS statistics.\r
We fit the 15-year data with models that include HD,\r
monopole, and dipole-correlated components in various\r
combinations. Table 2 lists the noise-marginalized am\u0002plitude estimates and S/N for all models. The goodness\u0002of-fit of the models can be compared using the Akaike\r
Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike 1998):\r
AIC = 2k + χ\r
2\r
, (G6)\r
where k is the number of model parameters and χ\r
2\r
is\r
the fit’s chi-squared, computed without accounting for\r
GW-induced ρab correlations. (This can be thought of\r
as a pseudo-Bayes factor, with the factor of 2k imposing\r
an Occam penalty.) The relative probability of a model\r
compared to the most-favored model is then given by\r
p(AIC) = exp [(AICmin − AIC)/2] , (G7)\r
where AICmin is the minimum AIC across all models.\r
Table 2 lists the AIC probabilities, computed by av\u0002eraging the AIC of each model over pulsar noise pa\u0002rameters. The HD-correlated model is preferred among

the precision to which the p-value can be measured.\r
the models with a single correlated process. The mod\u0002els with both HD and monopole correlations are pre\u0002ferred among all models: for a model with HD and\r
monopole correlations, we find S/N of 3.4 ± 0.8 for HD\r
correlations and 2.9 ± 0.8 for monopolar correlations,\r
while for a model with HD, monopole, and dipole cor\u0002relations, we find S/N of 2.9 ± 0.6 for HD correlations,\r
2.4 ± 0.6 for monopole correlations, and 0.6 ± 0.4 for\r
dipole correlations (means ± standard deviations across\r
noise-parameter posteriors). The statistical significance\r
of these S/Ns can be quantified empirically using sim\u0002ulations of 15-year–like data sets (see App. H.1), which\r
report p-values < 10−2 and ≃ 4 × 10−2for the observed\r
mean HD and monopole statistics across data replica\u0002tions with no spatially correlated injections.\r
As discussed in Sardesai & Vigeland (2023), the opti\u0002mal statistic and the MCOS are metrics of the apparent\r
spatial correlation pattern of the data, but they have\r
a limited ability to identify its actual source. That is\r
because a real HD signal may also excite the monopole\r
optimal statistic and the monopole component of the\r
MCOS; conversely, a real monopolar signal may also ex\u0002cite the HD optimal statistic and the HD component\r
of the MCOS; and so on. The S/Ns quoted in Table 2\r
quantify how often we would expect to measure the ob\u0002served value of the optimal statistic if only uncorrelated\r
noise is present, but they do not describe how often one\r
type of correlated noise would produce a given value of\r
the optimal statistic for a different type of correlation.\r

6.8×10−30 and to Aˆ2\r
HD = 5.5×10−30\r
, Aˆ2\r
monopole = 8×10−31\r
,\r
respectively. The monopolar component accounts for the\r
vertical shift of the cross-correlations with respect to the HD\r
curve. We use the standard version of the optimal statistic\r
that does not include inter-pulsar correlations to compute\r
ρab, so the points and errors do not match those shown in\r
panel (c) of Figure 1.\r
This effect can be characterized using simulations (see\r
App. H.1), which report a p-value of 0.11 for the ob\u0002served mean monopole statistic when a HD-correlated\r
signal with the MAP 15-year amplitude is included in\r
the simulated data sets. We conclude that there are\r
some indications of a possible monopole-correlated sig\u0002nal in the data with S/N comparable to but smaller than\r
the S/N for HD correlations; however, from simulations\r
we conclude that it is possible for such a signal to appear\r
in an MCOS analysis if only a HD-correlated stochastic\r
process is present.

H. MULTIPLE-CORRELATION OPTIMAL\r
STATISTIC SIMULATIONS\r
In this appendix we obtain the distribution of the\r
MCOS over an ensemble of simulated data sets, with\r
the goal of characterizing the probability that the ob\u0002served S/Ns could have been produced by pulsar noise\r
alone, or by a GWB with HD correlations. Unlike our\r
Bayesian analysis, the MCOS prefers a model that in\u0002cludes both HD and monopolar components. So we are\r
especially interested in asking how frequently we may\r
expect the observed MCOS monopole if the data con\u0002tain only the GWB. In Apps. H.1 and H.2 we present two\r
different types of simulations: “astrophysical,” where we\r
generate synthetic data with MAP noise parameters in\u0002ferred from the 15-year data set, both with and without\r
the GWB; and “model checking,” where we create data\r
replications following the hd13/3 posteriors for the real\r
data set. Note that neither simulation attempts to ac\u0002count for the monochromatic character of the putative\r
monopolar signal (see §5.2).\r
H.1. Astrophysical simulations\r
Following Pol et al. (2021), we generate simulated data\r
sets adopting MAP pulsar-noise parameters obtained\r
from the real data independently for each pulsar; these\r
“noise runs” include an additional power-law process to\r
reduce contamination between the putative GWB and\r
the pulsars’ intrinsic red noise (Taylor et al. 2022). We\r

Figure 18. Distribution of real-data and replicated MCOS\r
monopole S/Ns. Each point represents a draw η\r
(k)\r
from\r
hd13/3 posterior, which is used to simulate δtsim,(k)and to\r
compute both S/Ns. The replicated monopole S/N is greater\r
for 11% of the simulations.\r
lations: (i) injecting no spatially correlated power-law\r
GWB or excess uncorrelated common-spectrum noise;\r
(ii) injecting a spatially correlated power-law GWB with\r
amplitude 2.7×10−15 and spectral index 13/3; and (iii)\r
injecting no GWB or common-spectrum noise, but omit\u0002ting the additional power-law process in the estimation\r
of intrinsic pulsar noise, with the goal of testing how\r
often excess common-spectrum noise is recognized as a\r
spatially correlated GWB.\r
We compute HD + monopole + dipole MCOS S/Ns\r
for all synthetic data sets (see Figure 17). The mean\r
HD S/Ns observed in the real data (see App. G) corre\u0002spond to p-values of < 10−2\r
for simulations (i) and (iii),\r
and 0.64 for simulation (ii). The mean monopole S/Ns\r
observed in the real data set correspond to p-values of\r
4 × 10−2, 1.1 × 10−1, and < 10−2for simulations (i),\r
(ii), and (iii) respectively. We conclude that it is un\u0002likely that we would measure HD correlations at the\r
level observed in real data when no correlated signal\r
is present (simulation (i)) or when only uncorrelated\r
common-spectrum red noise is present (simulation (iii)).\r
In addition, the HD S/Ns obtained from a HD-correlated\r
GWB injection (simulation (ii)) are fully consistent with\r
the S/N observed in real data. By contrast, the observed\r
monopole S/N could have been produced by intrinsic\r
pulsar noise alone, or by a real HD signal.\r
H.2. Model-checking simulations\r
In App. H.1 we have tackled the question of monopole\r
S/N significance using simulations based on real-data\r
MAP estimates η\r
MAP of pulsar-noise and GW param\u0002eters. In this appendix we adopt a procedure with

30 The NANOGrav Collaboration\r
a stronger Bayesian flavor, evaluating the MCOS on\r
a population of data replications created using hd13/3\r
as a generative model with noise hyperparameters η\r
drawn from the hd13/3real-data posterior. This can be\r
seen also as a Bayesian model-checking exercise (Gelman\r
et al. 1996, 2013): if we find that the summary statis\u0002tic of interest (the monopole MCOS) has a much more\r
extreme value in real data than in data replications,\r
we should suspect that the data model (here hd13/3)\r
is missing something.\r
We perform the test by drawing 500 parameter vectors\r
{η\r
(k)} from the hd13/3\r
real-data posterior; for each η\r
(k)\r
we simulate a data set δtsim,(k) ∼ p(δt|η\r
(k)\r
) and com\u0002pare MCOS(δtsim,(k)\r
; η\r
(k)\r
) with MCOS(δt; η\r
(k)\r
). Our\r
notation emphasizes the dependence of the MCOS on\r
the pulsar noise parameters through the P matrices in\r
Equation 9. Figure 18 shows the resulting distribution\r
of monopole S/Ns. The replicated monopole S/N is\r
greater than its observed counterpart for 11% of the\r
draws. Thus, it is plausible that the MCOS could mea\u0002sure the observed monopole S/N in data that contain\r
only a HD-correlated GWB. Conversely, the observed\r
monopole S/N does not by itself suggest that hd13/3is\r
misspecified."""

ABSTRACT\r
We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars\r

Bayes factors of 200–1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical back\u0002ground distribution for these latter Bayes factors using a method that removes inter-pulsar correlations\r
from our data set, finding p = 10−3(approx. 3σ) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation\r
scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of inter-pulsar correlations yields\r
p = 5 × 10−5–1.9 × 10−4(approx. 3.5–4σ). Assuming a fiducial f\r

gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations\r
for a signal from a population of supermassive black-hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological\r
and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings–Downs correlations points\r
to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.\r

Almost a century had to elapse between Einstein’s pre\u0002diction of gravitational waves (GWs, Einstein 1916) and\r
their measurement from a coalescing binary of stellar\u0002mass black holes (Abbott et al. 2016). However, their\r
existence had been confirmed in the late 1970s through\r
measurements of the orbital decay of the Hulse–Taylor\r
binary pulsar (Hulse & Taylor 1975; Taylor et al. 1979).\r
Today, pulsars are again at the forefront of the quest to\r
detect GWs, this time from binary systems of central\r
galactic black holes.\r
Black holes with masses of 105–1010 M⊙ exist at the\r
center of most galaxies and are closely correlated with\r
the global properties of the host, suggesting a sym\u0002biotic evolution (Magorrian et al. 1998; McConnell &\r
Ma 2013). Galaxy mergers are the main drivers of hi\u0002erarchical structure formation over cosmic time (Blu\u0002menthal et al. 1984) and lead to the formation of\r
close massive–black-hole binaries long after the mergers\r
(Begelman et al. 1980; Milosavljevi´c & Merritt 2003).\r
The most massive of these (supermassive black-hole bi\u0002naries, SMBHBs, with masses 108–1010 M⊙) emit GWs\r
with slowly evolving frequencies, contributing to a noise\u0002like broadband signal in the nHz range (the GW back\u0002ground, GWB; Rajagopal & Romani 1995; Jaffe &\r
Backer 2003; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Sesana et al. 2004;\r
McWilliams et al. 2014; Burke-Spolaor et al. 2019). If\r
all contributing SMBHBs evolve purely by loss of cir\u0002cular orbital energy to gravitational radiation, the re\u0002sultant GWB spectrum is well described by a simple\r
f\r
−2/3\r
characteristic-strain power law (Phinney 2001).\r

However, GWB signals that are not produced by popu\u0002lations of inspiraling black holes may also lie within the\r
nHz band; these include primordial GWs from inflation,\r
scalar-induced GWs, and GW signals from multiple pro\u0002cesses arising due to cosmological phase transitions, such\r
as collisions of bubbles of the post-transition vacuum\r
state, sound waves, turbulence, and the decay of any\r
defects such as cosmic strings or domain walls that may\r
have formed (see, e.g., Guzzetti et al. 2016; Caprini &\r
Figueroa 2018; Dom`enech 2021, and references therein).\r
The detection of nHz GWs follows the template out\u0002lined by Pirani (1956, 2009), whereby we time the prop\u0002agation of light to measure modulations in the distance\r
between freely falling reference masses. Estabrook &\r
Wahlquist (1975) derived the GW response of electro\u0002magnetic signals traveling between Earth and distant\r
spacecraft, sparking interest in low-frequency GW de\u0002tection. Sazhin (1978) and Detweiler (1979) described\r
nHz GW detection using Galactic pulsars and (effec\u0002tively) the solar system barycenter as references, relying\r
on the regularity of pulsar emission and planetary mo\u0002tions to highlight GW effects. The fact that pulsars\r
are such accurate clocks enables precise measurements\r
of their rotational, astrometric, and binary parameters\r
(and more) from the times-of-arrival of their pulses,\r
which are used to develop ever-refining end-to-end tim\u0002ing models. Hellings & Downs (1983) made the cru\u0002cial suggestion that the correlations between the time\u0002of-arrival perturbations of multiple pulsars could reveal\r
a GW signal buried in pulsar noise; Romani (1989) and\r
Foster & Backer (1990) proposed that a pulsar timing\r
array (PTA) of highly stable millisecond pulsars (Backer\r
et al. 1982) could be used to search for a GWB. Nev\u0002ertheless, the first multi-pulsar, long-term GWB limits\r
were obtained by analyzing millisecond-pulsar residuals\r
independently, rather than as an array (Stinebring et al.\r
1990; Kaspi et al. 1994)."""

Figure 1. Summary of the main Bayesian and optimal-statistic analyses presented in this paper, which establish multiple lines\r
of evidence for the presence of Hellings–Downs correlations in the 15-year NANOGrav data set. Throughout we refer to the\r
68.3%, 95.4%, and 99.7% regions of distributions as 1/2/3σ regions, even in two dimensions. (a): Bayesian “free-spectrum”\r
analysis, showing posteriors (gray violins) of independent variance parameters for a Hellings–Downs-correlated stochastic process\r
at frequencies i/T, with T the total data set time span. The blue represents the posterior median and 1/2σ posterior bandsa\r
for a power-law model; the dashed black line corresponds to a γ = 13/3 (SMBHB-like) power-law, plotted with the median\r
posterior amplitude. See §3 for more details. (b): Posterior probability distribution of GWB amplitude and spectral exponent\r
in a HD power-law model, showing 1/2/3σ credible regions. The value γGWB = 13/3 (dashed black line) is included in the 99%\r
credible region. The amplitude is referenced to fref = 1 yr−1(blue) and 0.1 yr−1(orange). The dashed blue and orange curves\r
in the log10 AGWB subpanel shows its marginal posterior density for a γ = 13/3 model, with fref = 1 yr−1and fref = 0.1 yr−1,\r
respectively. See §3 for more details. (c): Angular-separation–binned inter-pulsar correlations, measured from 2,211 distinct\r
pairings in our 67-pulsar array using the frequentist optimal statistic, assuming maximum-a-posteriori pulsar noise parameters\r
and γ = 13/3 common-process amplitude from a Bayesian inference analysis. The bin widths are chosen so that each includes\r
approximately the same number of pulsar pairs, and central bin locations avoid zeros of the Hellings–Downs curve. This binned\r
reconstruction accounts for correlations between pulsar pairs (Romano et al. 2021; Allen & Romano 2022). The dashed black\r
line shows the Hellings–Downs correlation pattern, and the binned points are normalized by the amplitude of the γ = 13/3\r
common process to be on the same scale. Note that we do not employ binning of inter-pulsar correlations in our detection\r
statistics; this panel serves as a visual consistency check only. See §4 for more frequentist results. (d): Bayesian reconstruction\r
of normalized inter-pulsar correlations, modeled as a cubic spline within a variable-exponent power-law model. The violins plot\r
the marginal posterior densities (plus median and 68% credible values) of the correlations at the knots. The knot positions are\r
fixed, and are chosen on the basis of features of the Hellings–Downs curve (also shown as a dashed black line for reference): they\r
include the maximum and minimum angular separations, the two zero crossings of the Hellings–Downs curve, and the position\r
of minimum correlation. See §3 for more details.

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 5\r
From a statistical-inference standpoint, the problem\r
of detecting nHz GWs in PTA data is analogous to\r
GW searches with terrestrial and future space-borne\r
experiments, in which the propagation of light be\u0002tween reference masses is modeled with physical and\r
phenomenological descriptions of signal and noise pro\u0002cesses. It is distinguished by the irregular observation\r
times, which encourage a time- rather than Fourier\u0002domain formulation, and by noise sources (intrinsic pul\u0002sar noise, interstellar-medium–induced radio-frequency–\r
dependent fluctuations, and timing-model errors) that\r
are correlated on timescales common to the GWs of in\u0002terest. This requires the joint estimation of GW sig\u0002nals and noise, which is similar to the kinds of global\r
fitting procedures already used in terrestrial GW ex\u0002periments, and proposed for space-borne experiments.\r
GW analysts have therefore converged on a Bayesian\r
framework that represents all noise sources as Gaussian\r
processes (van Haasteren et al. 2009; van Haasteren &\r
Vallisneri 2014), and relies on model comparison (i.e.,\r
Bayes factors, which are ratios of fully marginalized like\u0002lihoods) to define detection (see, e.g., Taylor 2021). This\r
Bayesian approach is nevertheless complemented by null\r
hypothesis testing, using a frequentist detection statis\u0002tic1\r
(the “optimal statistic” of Anholm et al. 2009; De\u0002morest et al. 2013; Chamberlin et al. 2015) averaged\r
over Bayesian posteriors of the noise parameters (Vige\u0002land et al. 2018).\r
The GWB—rather than GW signals from individu\u0002ally resolved binary systems—is likely to become the\r
first nHz source accessible to PTA observations (Rosado\r
et al. 2015). Because of its stochastic nature, the GWB\r
cannot be identified as a distinctive phase-coherent sig\u0002nal in the way of individual compact-binary-coalescence\r
GWs. Rather, as PTA data sets grow in extent and\r
sensitivity one expects to first observe the GWB as ex\u0002cess low-frequency residual power of consistent ampli\u0002tude and spectral shape across multiple pulsars (Ro\u0002mano et al. 2021; Pol et al. 2021). An observation fol\u0002lowing this behavior was reported in 2020 (Arzoumanian\r
et al. 2020, henceforth NG12gwb) for the 12.5-year data\r
set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observa\u0002tory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav, McLaughlin\r
2013; Ransom et al. 2019), and then confirmed (Gon\u0002charov et al. 2021a; Chen et al. 2021) by the Parkes\r
Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA, Manchester et al. 2013)\r
and the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA, Desvi\u0002gnes et al. 2016), following many years of null results\r
and steadily decreasing upper limits on the GWB am\u00021 See Jenet et al. (2006) for an early example of a cross-correlation\r
statistic for PTA GWB detection.\r
plitude. A combined International Pulsar Timing Ar\u0002ray (IPTA, Perera et al. 2019) data release consisting of\r
older data sets from the constituent PTAs also confirmed\r
this observation (Antoniadis et al. 2022). Nevertheless,\r
the finding of excess power cannot be attributed to a\r
GWB origin merely by the consistency of amplitude and\r
spectral shape, which could arise from intrinsic pulsar\r
processes of similar magnitude (Goncharov et al. 2022;\r
Zic et al. 2022), or from a common systematic noise such\r
as clock errors (Tiburzi et al. 2016). Instead, definitive\r
proof of GW origin is sought by establishing the pres\u0002ence of phase-coherent inter-pulsar correlations with the\r
characteristic spatial pattern derived by Hellings and\r
Downs (1983, henceforth HD): for an isotropic GWB,\r
the correlation between the GW-induced timing delays\r
observed at Earth for any pair of pulsars is a universal,\r
quasi-quadrupolar function of their angular separation\r
in the sky. Even though this correlation pattern is mod\u0002ified if there is anisotropy in the GWB—which may be\r
the case for a GWB generated by a SMBHB population\r
(Mingarelli et al. 2013; Taylor & Gair 2013; Cornish &\r
Sesana 2013; Mingarelli & Sidery 2014; Mingarelli et al.\r
2017; Roebber & Holder 2017)—the HD template is ef\u0002fective for detecting even anisotropic GWBs in all but\r
the most extreme scenarios (Cornish & Sesana 2013;\r
Cornish & Sampson 2016; Taylor et al. 2020; B´ecsy et al.\r
2022; Allen 2023).\r
In this letter we present multiple lines of evidence\r
for an excess low-frequency signal with HD correlations\r
in the NANOGrav 15-year data set (Figure 1). Our\r
key results are as follows. The Bayes factor between\r
an HD-correlated, power-law GWB model and a spa\u0002tially uncorrelated common-spectrum power-law model\r
ranges from 200 to 1,000, depending on modeling choices\r
(Figure 2). The noise-marginalized optimal statistic,\r
which is constructed to be selectively sensitive to HD\u0002correlated power, achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of ∼ 5\r
(Figure 3 and Figure 4). We calibrated these detection\r
statistics by removing correlations from the 15-year data\r
set using the phase-shift technique, which removes inter\u0002pulsar correlations by adding random phase shifts to the\r
Fourier components of the common process (Taylor et al.\r
2017). We find false-alarm probabilities of p = 10−3 and\r
p = 5 × 10−5for the observed Bayes factor and optimal\r
statistic, respectively (see Figure 3).\r
For our fiducial power-law model (f\r

(which are calibrated under our modeling assumptions),\r
the estimation of γ is very sensitive to minor details in\r
the data model of a few pulsars.\r
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We\r

main results are discussed in detail in §3 and §4; they\r

studies, including a spectral analysis of the excess sig\u0002nal (§5.2), a correlation analysis that finds no signif\u0002icant evidence for additional spatially correlated pro\u0002cesses (§5.3), and cross-validation studies with single\u0002telescope data sets and leave-one-pulsar-out techniques\r
(§5.4). In the past two years we have performed an end\u0002to-end review of the NANOGrav experiment, to iden\u0002tify and mitigate possible sources of systematic error or\r
data set contamination: our improvements and consider\u0002ations are partly described in a set of companion papers:\r

set (Alam et al. 2021a,b) with 2.9 years of timing data\r
for the 47 pulsars in the previous data set, and with\r
21 new pulsars3. For this paper we analyze narrow\u0002band times of arrival (TOAs), which are computed sep\u0002arately for sub-bands of each receiver, and focus on\r
the 67 pulsars with a timing baseline ≥ 3 years. We\r
adopt the TT(BIPM2019) timescale and the JPL DE440\r
ephemeris (Park et al. 2021), which improves Jupiter’s\r
orbit with ranging and VLBI observations of the Juno\r
spacecraft. Uncertainties in the Jovian orbit impacted\r
NANOGrav’s 11-year GWB search (Arzoumanian et al.\r
2018; Vallisneri et al. 2020), but they are now negligible.\r
For each pulsar, we fit the TOAs to a timing model\r
that includes pulsar spin period, spin period derivative,\r
sky location, proper motion, and parallax. While not\r
all pulsars have measurable parallax and proper mo\u0002tion, we always include these parameters because they\r
induce delays with the same frequencies for all pulsars\r
(f = 0.5 yr−1for parallax and f = yr−1 plus a lin\u0002ear envelope for proper motion), so there is a risk that\r
a parallax or proper motion signal could be misidenti\u0002fied as a GW signal. Fitting for these parameters in all\r
pulsars reduces our sensitivity to GWs at those frequen\u0002cies; however, this effect is minimal for GWB searches\r
since these frequencies are much higher than the fre\u0002quencies at which we expect the GWB to be signifi\u0002cant. For binary pulsars, the timing model includes also\r
five orbital elements for binary pulsars and additional\r
non-Keplerian parameters when these improve the fit as\r
determined by an F test. We fit variations in disper\u0002sion measure as a piecewise constant “DMX” function\r
(Arzoumanian et al. 2015; Jones et al. 2017). The in\u0002dividual analysis of each pulsar provides best-fit esti\u0002mates of the timing residuals δt, of white measurement\r
noise, and of intrinsic red noise, modeled as a power\r
law (Cordes 2013; Lam et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2017).4\r
White measurement noise is described by three param\u0002eters: a linear scaling of TOA uncertainties (“EFAC”),\r
white noise added to the TOA uncertainties in quadra\u0002ture (“EQUAD”), and noise common to all sub-bands\r
at the same epoch (“ECORR”), with independent pa\u0002rameters for every receiver/backend combination (see\r

reduction pipeline: a complete discussion of the data set\r
can be found in NG15.\r
In our Bayesian GWB analysis, we model δt as a fi\u0002nite Gaussian process consisting of time-correlated fluc\u0002tuations that include intrinsic red pulsar noise and (po\u0002tentially) a GW signal, along with timing-model uncer\u0002tainties (van Haasteren et al. 2009; van Haasteren &\r
Vallisneri 2014; Taylor 2021). The red noise is mod\u0002eled with Fourier basis F and amplitudes c (Lentati\r
et al. 2013). All Fourier bases (the columns of F) are\r
sines and cosines computed on the TOAs with frequen\u0002cies fi = i/T, where T = 16.03 yr is the TOA ex\u0002tent. The timing-model uncertainties are modeled with\r
design-matrix basis M and coefficients ϵ. The single\u0002pulsar log likelihood is then\r

with\r
r = δt − F c − Mϵ. (2)\r
The prior for the ϵ is taken to be uniform with infinite\r
extent, so the posterior is driven entirely by the like\u0002lihood. The set of the {c} for all pulsars take a joint\r
normal prior with zero mean and covariance\r
⟨caicbj ⟩ = δij (δabφai + Φab,i) ; (3)\r
here a, b range over pulsars and i, j over Fourier com\u0002ponents; δij is Kronecker’s delta. The term φai de\u0002scribes the spectrum of intrinsic red noise in pulsar\r
a, while Φab,i describes processes with common spec\u0002trum across all pulsars and (potentially) phase-coherent\r
inter-pulsar correlations. The {c} prior ties together the\r
single-pulsar likelihoods (Equation 1) into a joint pos\u0002terior, p(c, ϵ, η|δt) ∝ p(δt|c, ϵ)p(c, ϵ|η)p(η), where we\r
have dropped subscripts to denote the concatenation of\r
vectors for all pulsars, and where η denotes all the hy\u0002perparameters (such as red-noise and GWB power spec\u0002trum amplitudes) that determine the covariances. We\r
marginalize over c and ϵ analytically, and use Markov\r
chain Monte Carlo techniques (see App. B) to estimate\r
p(η|δt) for different models of the intrinsic red noise and\r
common spectrum.\r
The data-model variants adopted in this paper all\r
share this probabilistic setup, but differ in the struc\u0002ture and parametrization of Φab,i. For a model with\r
intrinsic red noise only (henceforth irn), Φab,i = 0;\r
for common-spectrum spatially-uncorrelated red noise\r
(curn), Φab,i = δabΦCURN,i; for an isotropic GWB with\r

a few pulsars (see the analysis in §5.2). Notably, in the\r

remove the dependence of inter-pulsar spatial correla\u0002tions on the angular separations between the pulsars by\r
attributing random sky positions to the pulsars. Sky\r

As in NG12gwb, we also carried out a minimally mod\u0002eled Bayesian reconstruction of the inter-pulsar correla\u0002tion pattern, using spline interpolation over seven spline\u0002knot positions. The choice of seven spline-knot posi\u0002tions is based on features of the Hellings–Downs pattern:\r

frequency components to model the signal: the depen\u0002dence on the number of frequency components is very\r
weak.\r
Because the distribution of Aˆ2\r
is only approximately\r
normal (Hazboun et al. 2023), the S/N of Equation 11\r
does not map analytically to a p-value, and it cannot\r
be interpreted as a “sigma” level. Instead, optimal\u0002statistic p-values can be computed empirically by re\u0002moving inter-pulsar correlations from the 15-year data\r
set with phase shifts (Taylor et al. 2017). We draw ran\u0002dom phase offsets from 0 to 2π for the common-process\r
Fourier components, which is equivalent to making uni\u0002form draws from the background distribution of CURN,\r
and ask how often a random choice of phase offsets\r
produces a HD-correlated signal. The right panel of\r
Figure 3 shows the distribution of noise-marginalized\r
S/N over 400,000 phase shifts. There are 19 phase\r
shifts with noise-marginalized S/N greater than ob\u0002served, with p = 5 × 10−5\r
. We compare the phase-shift\r
distribution with backgrounds obtained by simulation\r
(right panel of Figure 3, orange line) and analytic calcu\u0002lation (green line). For the former, we simulate 27,000\r
curnγrealizations using MAP hyperparameters from\r
the 15-yr data and compute the optimal-statistic S/N for\r
each; for the latter, we evaluate the generalized χ\r
2 dis\u0002tribution (Hazboun et al. 2023) with median curnγ hy\u0002perparameters. Although neither method includes the\r
marginalization over noise-parameter posteriors, we find\r
good agreement with phase shifts, with p = 1.8 × 10−4\r
from simulations, and p = 1.9 × 10−4from the analytic\r
calculation. Finally, we use sky scrambles to compute\r
the p-value for the null hypothesis that inter-pulsar cor\u0002relations are present, but they have no dependence on\r
the angular separation between the pulsars, for which\r
we find p < 10−4(see App. F).\r
Averaging the cross-correlations ρab in angular\u0002separation bins with equal numbers of pulsar pairs re\u0002veals the Hellings–Downs pattern, as shown in panel\r
(c) of Figure 1 for 15 bins. The ρab were evalu\u0002ated with MAP curn13/3 noise parameters. The black\r
dashed curve traces the expected correlations for an HD\u0002correlated background with the MAP amplitude; the\r
vertical error bars display the expected 1σ spreads of the\r
binned cross-correlations, accounting for the ⟨ρabρcd⟩\r
covariances induced by the HD-correlated process (Ro\u0002mano et al. 2021; Allen & Romano 2022). (Neglecting\r
those covariances yields 20–40% smaller spreads. Note\r
that they are not included in p-value estimates because\r
those are calculated under the null hypothesis of no spa\u0002tially correlated process.)\r
Although each draw from the noise-parameter poste\u0002rior would generate a slightly different plot, as would\r
different binnings, the quality of the fit seen in Fig\u0002ure 1 provides a visual indication that the excess low\u0002frequency power in the 15-year data set harbors HD\r
correlations. The χ\r

for this 15-bin reconstruction with\r

In this paper and in previous GW searches (e.g.,\r

makes it easier to directly compare the results here to\r

The Fourier coefficients follow a power law similar to\r
those of intrinsic and common-spectrum red noise, but\r
their basis vectors include a ν\r

radio-frequency depen\u0002dence, and the component frequencies fi = i/T range\r
through i = 1–100. Under the DMGP model we also in\u0002clude a deterministic solar-wind model (Hazboun et al.\r
2022) and the two chromatic events in PSR J1713+0747\r
reported in Lam et al. (2018) which are modeled as de\u0002terministic exponential dips with the chromatic index\r
quantifying the radio-frequency dependence of the dips\r
left as a free parameter. If these chromatic events are\r
not modeled, they raise estimated white noise (Hazboun\r

is due mostly to bin 8 and to the lower-than-expected\r
correlated power found in bin 1. Obviously, excluding\r
those bins leads to higher γHD estimates.\r
To explore deviations from a pure power law that may\r
arise from statistical fluctuations of the astrophysical\r
background or from unmodeled systematics (perhaps re\u0002lated to the timing model), in App. D we relax the nor\u0002mal ck prior (cf. Equation 3) to a multivariate Student’s\r
t-distribution that is more accepting of mild outliers.\r
The resulting estimate of γCURN peaks at a higher value\r
and is broader than in curnγ, with posterior medians\r

Similarly, spectral turnovers due to interactions be\u0002tween SMBHBs and their environments can result in\r
reduced GWB power at lower frequencies, which might\r
explain the slightly lower correlated power in bin 1. We\r
investigate this hypothesis in App. E using the turnover\r
spectrum of Sampson et al. (2015). For this curnturnover\r
model, the 15-year data favor a spectral bend below 10\r
nHz (near f5), but the Bayes factor against the standard\r
hdγis inconclusive.\r
Future data sets with longer time spans and the com\u0002parison of our data set with those of other PTAs should\r
help clarify the astrophysical or systematic origin of\r
these possible spectral features."""

We can perform a frequentist generic correlation\r

this Legendre series using the MCOS and marginalizing\r
over curnγ noise-parameter posteriors. The quadrupo\u0002lar structure of the data is evident, along with a small\r
but significant monopolar contribution.\r
The same feature from the Legendre decomposition\r
appears if we use the MCOS to search for multiple cor\u0002relations simultaneously: a multiple regression analy\u0002sis favors models that contain both significant HD and\r
monopole correlations (see App. G). From simulations\r
of 15-year-like data sets (see App. H.1), we find a p\u0002value of 0.11 (approx. 2σ) for observing a monopole at\r
this significance or higher with a pure-HD injection of\r
amplitude similar to what we observe. We also per\u0002form a model-checking study to assess whether the ob\u0002served monopole is consistent with the hd13/3 model\r
(see App. H.2), and we find a p-value of 0.11 for pro\u0002ducing an apparent monopole when the signal is purely\r
hd13/3. Thus, we conclude that it is possible for a HD\u0002correlated signal to appear to have monopole correla\u0002tions in an optimal statistic analysis at this significance\r
level.\r
6 A Bayesian method for fitting correlations using Legendre poly\u0002nomials can be found in Nay et al. (2023).\r
In contrast, Bayesian searches for additional correla\u0002tions do not find evidence of additional monopole- or\r
dipole-correlated red noise processes: as shown in Fig\u0002ure 2, the Bayes factors for these processes are ∼ 1. We\r
also perform a general Bayesian search for correlations\r
using a curnfree + hdfree + monopolefree + dipolefree\r
model, which allows for independent uncorrelated and\r
correlated components at every frequency bin. We note\r
that this analysis is more flexible than the ones described\r
above, which assume a power-law power spectral den\u0002sity. We find no significant dipole-correlated power at\r
any frequency, and we find monopole-correlated power\r
only in the second frequency bin (f2 = 3.95 nHz); pos\u0002teriors of variance for that bin are shown in the right\r
panel of Figure 6.\r
Motivated by this finding, we perform a search for hdγ\r
+ sinusoid, which includes a deterministic sinusoidal\r
delay (applied to all pulsars alike, as appropriate for a\r
monopole) with free frequency, amplitude, and phase.\r
The sinusoid’s posteriors match the free-spectral analy\u0002sis in frequency and amplitude; however, the Bayes fac\u0002tor between hdγ + sinusoid and hdγ\r
calculated using\r
two methods (Hee et al. 2015; Hourihane et al. 2023),\r
is only ∼ 1, so the signal cannot be considered statis\u0002tically significant. Astrophysically motivated searches\r
for sources that produce sinusoidal or sinusoid-like de\u0002lays in the residuals, such as an individual SMBHB or\r
perturbations to the local gravitational field induced by\r
fuzzy dark matter (Khmelnitsky & Rubakov 2014), also\r
yield Bayes factors ∼ 1. Thus we conclude that there\r
is some evidence of additional power at 3.95 nHz with\r
monopole correlations; however, the significance in the\r
Bayesian analyses is low, while the optimal-statistic S/N\r
could be produced by a HD-correlated signal. There\u0002fore, we cannot definitively say whether the signal is\r
present, or determine the source. We note that per\u0002forming an MCOS analysis after subtracting off real\u0002izations of a sinusoid using hdγ + sinusoid posteri\u0002ors reduces the (S/N)monopole ≃ 0 while (S/N)HD re\u0002mains unchanged, indicating that this single-frequency\r
monopole-correlated signal is likely causing the nonzero\r
monopole signal observed in the MCOS analysis.\r
Similar hints of a monopolar signal (though weaker)\r
were found in the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, unsur\u0002prisingly given that it is a subset of the current data set.\r
To exercise due diligence, we audited the correction of\r
telescope time to GPS time at the Arecibo Observatory\r
and at the Green Bank Telescope, and found nothing\r
that could explain our observations. The subsequent\r
steps in the time-correction pipeline rely on very accu\u0002rate atomic clocks and are unlikely to introduce consid\u0002erable systematics (Petit 2022). An important test will"""

The GWB is by its nature a signal affecting all of the\r
pulsars in the PTA, although it may appear more signif\u0002icant in some based on their observing time span, noise\r
properties, and on the particular realization of pulsar\r
and Earth contributions (Speri et al. 2023). One way\r
to assess the significance of the GWB in each pulsar is\r
a Bayesian dropout analysis (Aggarwal et al. 2019; Ar\u0002zoumanian et al. 2020), which introduces a binary pa\u0002rameter that turns on and off the common signal (or its\r
inter-pulsar correlations) for a single pulsar, leaving all\r
other pulsars unchanged. The Bayes factor associated\r
with this parameter, also referred to as the “dropout\r
factor,” describes how much each pulsar likes to “par\u0002ticipate” in the common signal.\r
Figure 8 plots curnγ vs. irn dropout factors for all\r
67 pulsars (blue). We find positive dropout factors (i.e.,\r
dropout factors > 2) for an uncorrelated common pro\u0002cess in twenty pulsars, while only one has a dropout\r
factor < 0.5. For comparison, in the NANOGrav 12.5-\r
year data set ten pulsars showed positive dropout fac\u0002tors for an uncorrelated common process, while three\r
had negative dropout factors. We also show HD corre\u0002lations vs. curnγ dropout factors (orange). For these,\r
the uncorrelated common process is always present in\r
all pulsars, but the cross-correlations for all pulsar pairs\r
involving a given pulsar may be dropped from the like\u0002lihood. We find positive factors for HD correlations vs.\r
curnγin seven pulsars, while three are negative. We\r
expect more pulsars to have positive dropout factors for\r
curnγ vs. irn than for Hellings–Downs vs. curnγ be\u0002cause the Bayes factor comparing the first two models\r
is significantly higher than the one comparing the sec\u0002ond two models (see Figure 2). Negative dropout factors\r
could be caused by noise fluctuations or they could be\r
an indication that more advanced chromatic noise mod\u0002eling is necessary (Alam et al. 2021a). They could also\r
be caused by the GWB itself, which induces both corre\u0002lated and uncorrelated noise in the pulsars (the so-called\r
“Earth terms” and “pulsar terms”; Mingarelli & Min\u0002garelli 2018).\r
In addition to Bayes factors, the goodness-of-fit of\r
probabilistic models can be evaluated by assessing their\r
predictive performance (Gelman et al. 2013). Specifi\u0002cally, given that the GWB is correlated across pulsars,\r

six months of data at each step. New pulsars are added\r
when they accumulate three years of data. The blue violin\r
plot shows the distribution of the optimal statistic S/N over\r
curnγ noise parameters. The dashed orange line shows the\r
number of pulsars used for each time slice.\r
the lowest frequencies of our data are dominated by the\r
GWB, the optimal statistic S/N should grow with the\r
square root of the time span of the data and linearly\r
with the number of pulsars in the array (Siemens et al.\r
2013); in this regime increasing the number of pulsars is\r
the best way to boost PTA sensitivity to the GWB. To\r
verify that this is indeed the case, we analyze “slices”\r
of the data set in six-month increments, starting from\r
a six-year data set. Once a new pulsar accumulates\r
three years of data, we add it to the array. We per\u0002form a separate Bayesian curnγ analysis for each slice\r
and calculate the Hellings–Downs optimal statistic over\r
the noise-parameter posterior. In Figure 9, we plot the\r
S/N distributions against time span and the number of\r
pulsars. As expected, we observe essentially monotonic\r
growth associated with the increase in the number of\r
pulsars.\r
The signal should also be consistent between tim\u0002ing observations made with Arecibo and GBT. To test\r
this, we analyze the two split-telescope data sets (see\r
App. A); both show evidence of common-spectrum ex\u0002cess noise. Figure 10 shows Arecibo (orange) and GBT\r
(green) curnγ posteriors, which are broadly consistent\r
with each other and with full-data posteriors (blue).\r
Arecibo yields log10 A = −14.02+0.18\r

detected in a larger number of pulsars. For the first time,\r
we find compelling evidence of Hellings–Downs inter\u0002pulsar correlations, using both Bayesian and frequen\u0002tist detection statistics (see Figure 1), with false-alarm\r
probabilities of p = 10−3 and p = 5 × 10−5–1.9 × 10−4,\r
respectively (see Figure 3).\r
The significance of Hellings–Downs correlations in\u0002creases as we increase the number of frequency com\u0002ponents in the analysis up to five, indicating that the\r
correlated signal extends over a range of frequencies.\r
A detailed spectral analysis supports a power-law sig\u0002nal, but at least two frequency bins show deviations\r
that may skew the determination of spectral slope (Fig\u0002ure 6). These discrepancies may arise from astrophysi\u0002cal or systematic effects. Furthermore, slope determi\u0002nation changes significantly using an alternative DM\r
model (Figure 5). The study of spatial correlations with\r
the optimal statistic confirms a Hellings–Downs quasi\u0002quadrupolar pattern (Figure 7 and panel c of Figure 1),\r
with some indications of an additional monopolar signal\r
confined to a narrow frequency range near 4 nHz. How\u0002ever, the Bayesian evidence for this monopolar signal is\r
inconclusive, and we could not ascribe it to any astro\u0002physical or terrestrial source (e.g., an individual SMBHB\r
or errors in the chain of timing corrections).\r
The GWB is a persistent signal that should increase in\r
significance with number of pulsars and observing time\r
span. This is indeed what we observe by analyzing slices\r
of the data set (see Figure 9). Furthermore, the signal is\r
present in multiple pulsars (Figure 8), and can be found\r
in independent single-telescope data sets (Figure 10).\r
We are preparing a number of other papers searching\r
the 15-year data set for stochastic and deterministic sig\u0002nals, including an all-sky, all-frequency search for GWs\r
from individual circular SMBHBs. This search, together\r
with the same analysis of the 12.5-year data set (Arzou\u0002manian et al. 2023), indicates that the spectrum and\r
correlations we observe cannot be produced by an indi\u0002vidual circular SMBHB.\r
If the Hellings–Downs-correlated signal is indeed an\r
astrophysical GWB, its origin remains indeterminate.\r
Among the many possible sources in the PTA frequency\r
band, numerous studies have focused on the unresolved\r
background from a population of close-separation SMB\u0002HBs. The SMBHB population is a direct byproduct\r
of hierarchical structure formation, which is driven by\r
galaxy mergers (e.g., Blumenthal et al. 1984). In a\r
post-merger galaxy, the SMBHs sink to the center of\r
the common merger remnant through dynamical inter\u0002actions with their astrophysical environment, eventually\r
leading to the formation of a binary (Begelman et al.\r
1980). GW emission from a SMBHB at nHz frequencies\r
is quasi-monochromatic because the binaries evolve very\r
slowly. Under the assumption of purely GW-driven bi\u0002nary evolution, the expected characteristic-strain spec\u0002trum is ∝ f\r
−2/3\r
(or f\r
−13/3\r
for pulsar-timing residuals).\r
The GWB spectrum may also feature a low-frequency\r
turnover induced by the dynamical interactions of bi\u0002naries with their astrophysical environment (e.g., with\r
stars or gas, see Armitage & Natarajan 2002; Sesana\r
et al. 2004; Merritt & Milosavljevi´c 2005) or possibly by\r
non-negligible orbital eccentricities persisting to small\r
separations (Enoki & Nagashima 2007). We find little\r
support for a low-frequency turnover in our data (see\r
App. E).\r
The GWB amplitude is determined primarily by\r
SMBH masses and by the occurrence rate of close bi\u0002naries, which in turn depends on the galaxy merger\r
rate, the occupation fraction of SMBHs, and the binary\r
evolution timescale; population models predict ampli\u0002tudes ranging over more than an order of magnitude\r
(Rajagopal & Romani 1995; Wyithe & Loeb 2003; Jaffe\r
& Backer 2003; McWilliams et al. 2014; Sesana 2013),\r
under a variety of assumptions. Figure 11 displays a\r
comparison of hdγ parameter posteriors with power-law\r
spectral fits from an observationally constrained semi\u0002analytic model of the SMBHB population constructed\r
with the holodeck package (Kelley et al. 2023). This\r
particular set of SMBHB populations assumes purely\r
GW-driven binary evolution, and uses relatively nar\u0002row distributions of model parameters based on liter\u0002ature constraints from galaxy-merger observations (see,\r
e.g., Tomczak et al. 2014). While the amplitude recov\u0002ered in our analysis is consistent with models derived\r
directly from our understanding of SMBH and galaxy\r
evolution, it is toward the upper end of predictions im\u0002plying a combination of relatively high SMBH masses\r
and binary fractions. A detailed discussion of the GWB\r
from SMBHBs in light of our results is given in Agazie\r
et al. (2023a).\r
In addition to SMBHBs, more exotic cosmological\r
sources such as inflation, cosmic strings, phase transi\u0002tions, domain walls, and curvature-induced GWs can\r
also produce detectable GWBs in the nHz range (see,\r
e.g., Guzzetti et al. 2016; Caprini & Figueroa 2018, and\r
references therein). Similarities in the spectral shapes of\r
cosmological and astrophysical signals make it challeng\u0002ing to determine the origin of the background from its\r
spectral characterization (Kaiser et al. 2022). The ques\u0002tion could be settled by the detection of signals from\r
individual loud SMBHBs or by the observation of spa\u0002tial anisotropies, since the anisotropies expected from\r
SMBHBs are orders of magnitude larger than those pro\u0002duced by most cosmological sources (Caprini & Figueroa

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 23\r
APPENDIX\r
A. ADDITIONAL DATA SET DETAILS\r
The observations included in the NANOGrav 15-year\r
data set were performed between July 2004 and August\r
2020 with the 305-m Arecibo Observatory (Arecibo), the\r
100-m Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and, since 2015,\r
the 27 25-m antennae of the Very Large Array (VLA).\r
We used Arecibo to observe the 33 pulsars that lie within\r
its declination range (0◦ < δ < +39◦); GBT to ob\u0002serve the pulsars that lie outside of Arecibo’s range,\r
plus J1713+0747 and B1937+21, for a total of 36 pul\u0002sars; the VLA to observe the seven pulsars J0437−4715,\r
J1600−3053, J1643−1224, J1713+0747, J1903+0327,\r
J1909−3744, and B1937+21. Six of these were also ob\u0002served with Arecibo, GBT, or both; J0437−4715 was\r
only visible to the VLA. Figure 12 shows the sky loca\u0002tions of the 67 pulsars used for the GWB search (top)\r
and the distribution of angular separations for the pulsar\r
pairs (bottom).\r
Initial observations were performed with the ASP\r
(Arecibo) and GASP (GBT) systems, with 64-MHz\r
bandwidth (Demorest 2007). Between 2010 and 2012,\r
we transitioned to the PUPPI (Arecibo) and GUPPI\r
(GBT) systems, with bandwidths up to 800 MHz (Du\u0002Plain et al. 2008; Ford et al. 2010). We observe pulsars\r
in two different radio-frequency bands in order to mea\u0002sure pulse dispersion from the interstellar medium: at\r
Arecibo, we use the 1.4 GHz receiver plus either the 430\r
MHz or 2.1 GHz receiver (and the 327 MHz receiver for\r
early observations of J2317+1439); at GBT, we use the"""

In §5.4 we analyze also two split-telescope data sets:\r
33 pulsars for Arecibo, and 35 for GBT (excluding\r
J0614−3329, which was observed for less than three\r
years). For the two pulsars timed by both telescopes\r
(J1713+0747 and B1937+21), we partition the timing\r
data between the telescopes and obtain independent\r
timing solutions for each. We do not analyze a VLA-only\r
data set, which would have shorter observation spans\r
and significantly reduced sensitivity.\r
B. BAYESIAN METHODS & DIAGNOSTICS\r
The prior probability distributions assumed for all\r
analyses in this paper are listed in Table 1. We use\r
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to sam\u0002ple randomly from the joint posterior distribution of our\r
model parameters. Marginal distributions are obtained\r
simply by considering only the parameter of interest 16h 12h 8h 4h\r

15-year GWB analysis. Markers indicate which telescopes\r
observed the pulsar. Bottom: Distribution of angular sepa\u0002rations probed by the pulsars in the full data set (orange),\r
the Arecibo data set (blue), and the GBT data set (red).\r
Because Arecibo and GBT mostly observed pulsars at differ\u0002ent declinations, there are few inter-telescope pairs at small\r
angular separations, resulting in a deficit of pairs for the full\r
data set in the first bin.\r
in each sample. To assess convergence of our MCMC\r
runs beyond visual inspection we use the Gelman–Rubin\r
statistic, requiring R <ˆ 1.01 for all parameters (Gelman\r
& Rubin 1992; Vehtari et al. 2021). We performed most\r
runs discussed in this paper with the PTMCMC sampler\r
(Ellis & van Haasteren 2017) and postprocessed sam\u0002ples with chainconsumer (Hinton 2016).\r
In NG12gwb we use an analytic approximation for the\r
uncertainty of marginalized-posterior statistics (Wilcox\r
2012). Here we instead adopt a boostrap approach:\r
we resample the original MCMC samples (with replace\u0002ment) to generate new sets that act as independent sam\u0002pling realizations. We then calculate the distributions of\r
the desired summary statistics (e.g., quantiles, marginal\u0002ized posterior values) over these sets. From these distri\u0002butions, we determine central values and uncertainties\r
(either medians and 68% confidence intervals, or means\r
and standard deviations)."""

We rely on a variety of techniques to perform Bayesian\r
model comparison. The first is thermodynamic integra\u0002tion (e.g., Ogata 1989; Gelman & Meng 1998), which\r
computes Bayesian evidence integrals directly through\r
parallel tempering: we run Nβ MCMC chains that ex\u0002plore variants of the likelihood function raised to dif\u0002ferent exponents β, then approximate the evidence for\r
model H as\r

where all likelihoods and posteriors are computed\r
within model H, θ denotes all of the model’s parame\u0002ters, and the expectation ⟨ln p(d|θ)⟩β is approximated\r
by MCMC with respect to the posterior pβ(θ|d) ∝\r
p(d|θ, H)\r
βp(θ, H). The inverse temperatures β are\r
spaced geometrically, as is the default in PTMCMC.\r
To compare nested models, which differ by “freezing”\r
a subset of parameters, we also use the Savage–Dickey\r
density ratio (Dickey 1971): if models H and H0 differ\r
by the fact that (say) θ0 is frozen to 0 in the latter, then\r
p(d|H0)/p(d|H) = p(θ0 = 0|d, H)/p(θ0 = 0|H).\r
When comparing disjoint models with different like\u0002lihoods (e.g., hd versus curn), we use product-space\r
sampling (Carlin & Chib 1995; Godsill 2001). This\r
method treats model comparison as a parameter estima\u0002tion problem, where we sample the union of the unique\r
parameters of all models, plus a model-indexing param\u0002eter that activates the relevant likelihood function and\r
parameter space of one of the sub-models. Bayes fac\u0002tors are then obtained by counting how often the model\r
index falls in each activation region and taking ratios of\r
those counts.\r
In some situations, it can be difficult to sample a com\u0002putationally expensive model directly. In these cases,\r
we sample a computationally cheaper approximate dis\u0002tribution and reweight those posterior samples to es\u0002timate the posterior for the computationally expensive\r
model (Hourihane et al. 2023). The reweighted poste\u0002rior can be used in the thermodynamic-integration or\r
Savage–Dickey methods. In addition, the mean of the\r
weights yields the Bayes factor between the expensive

NANOGrav 15-year Gravitational-Wave Background 25\r
and approximate models, which may be of direct interest\r
(e.g., hd can be approximated by curn). We estimate\r
Bayes-factor uncertainties using bootstrapping and, for\r
product-space sampling, with the Markov-model tech\u0002niques of Cornish & Littenberg (2015) and Heck et al.\r
(2019).\r
C. BROKEN POWER-LAW MODEL\r
As shown in NG12gwb, the simultaneous Bayesian es\u0002timation of white measurement noise and of red-noise\r
processes described by power laws biases the recovery\r
of the spectral index of the latter (Lam et al. 2017;\r
Hazboun et al. 2019). Just as in NG12gwb and An\u0002toniadis et al. (2022), we impose a high-frequency cutoff\r
on the red-noise processes. To choose the cutoff fre\u0002quency, we perform inference on our data with a curnγ\r
model modified so that the common process has power\r
spectral density\r

ref ;\r
(C2)\r
then set the cutoff to the MAP fbreak. Equation C2 is\r
fairly generic, allowing for separate spectral indices at\r
low (γ) and high (δ) frequencies. The break frequency\r
fbreak dictates where the broken power law changes spec\u0002tral index, while ℓ (which we set to 0.1) controls the\r
smoothness of the transition.\r
The marginal posterior for fbreak, obtained in the\r
factorized-likelihood approximation using the tech\u0002niques of Lamb et al. (2023), has median and 90% cred\u0002ible region of 3.2\r
+5.4\r
−1.2 × 10−8 Hz, and a MAP value of\r
2.75 × 10−8 Hz. The latter is close to f14 = 14/T in our\r
frequency basis (with T the total span of the data set),\r
so we use 14 frequencies to model common-spectrum\r
noise processes (see §2 and NG12gwb).\r
D. T-PROCESS SPECTRUM MODEL\r
The free-spectrum analysis of our data (§5.2 and Fig\u0002ure 6) shows that the frequency bins at f1, f6, f7, and\r
f8 appear to be in tension with a pure power law, skew\u0002ing the estimation of γ and reducing the hd13/3 vs.\r
curn13/3 Bayes factor. Assuming that those frequency\r
components reflect unmodeled systematics or stronger\u0002than-expected statistical fluctuations, we can make our\r
inference more robust to such outliers with a “fuzzy”\r
power-law model that allows the individual Φi to vary\r
more freely around their expected values. To wit, we\r
introduce the t-process spectrum (TPS)\r
ΦTPS,i = xiΦpowerlaw,i with x ∼ invgamma(xi; 1, 1),\r
(D3)\r
where Φpowerlaw,i follows Equation 6 and x follows the\r
inverse gamma distribution with parameters α = β = 1;\r
the resulting Gaussian mixture yields a Student’s-t dis\u0002tribution for the ΦTPS,i. Figure 13 shows curnγ power\u0002law posteriors and curnTPS modified power-law posteri\u0002ors, obtained in the factorized-likelihood approximation\r
(Taylor et al. 2022; Lamb et al. 2023) and compared\r
to curnfree bin variances. The TPS model is spread\r
more widely and deviates from the perfect power law at\r
bins f1, f6, f7, and f8, as expected. The right panel of\r
Figure 13 shows the joint log10 A, γ posteriors for curnγ\r
and curnTPS. The latter is more consistent with steeper\r
power laws, and it includes γ = 13/3 at 1σ credibility.\r
E. TURNOVER MODEL\r
The final parameterized spectral model that we in\u0002vestigate is motivated by the idea that the dynamics\r
of SMBHBs are influenced by their environments at\r
sub-parsec separations (Armitage & Natarajan 2002;\r
Sesana et al. 2004; Merritt & Milosavljevi´c 2005). These\r
interactions affect binary evolution and the resulting\r
spectrum of the GWB. The process of bringing two\r
SMBHs together after galaxy mergers involves a com\u0002plex chain of interactions: despite significant theoretical\r
work, the lack of observational constraints makes it dif\u0002ficult to draw any conclusions. PTAs, however, provide\r
a unique opportunity to probe the timescale over which\r
two SMBHs evolve from the merger of their galaxies to\r
a bound binary that produces GW signals in the PTA\r
sensitivity band.\r
When dynamical interactions dominate orbital evo\u0002lution, binaries will traverse the GW spectrum more\r
quickly, reducing GW emission compared to a GW\u0002driven inspiral. This kind of behavior is captured by\r
the turnover model (Sampson et al. 2015):\r
S(f) = A2\r
12π\r

f\r
−3\r
ref . (E4)\r
This is qualitatively similar to the broken power law dis\u0002cussed earlier, except that here f0 represents the GW\r
frequency at which typical binary evolution transitions\r
from environmentally dominated (at lower frequencies\r
and wider separations) to GW-dominated (at higher fre\u0002quencies and smaller separations). The parameter κ\r
controls the shape of the spectrum below f0, and de\u0002pends on the orbital-evolution mechanism. Note that\r
the actual turning point of the spectrum is not at f0\r
but at fbend = f0 × (3κ/4 − 1)1/κ (NG9gwb).\r
Applying this model to our data, we find hints of de\u0002partures from a pure power law: the transition frequency\r
f0 lies below 10 nHz with 65% credibility, while the\r
bend frequency lies below 10 nHz with 75% credibility."""

γ = 13/3 (dashed line).\r
Nevertheless, Bayesian comparison of this curnturnover\r
model with curnγreports an inconclusive Bayes fac\u0002tor of 1.46±0.02 in favor of curnturnover. Furthermore,\r
the estimation of curnturnover parameters is sensitive to\r
DM modeling (see §5.1). While the spectra are broadly\r

fluctuations, there are differences in the power at certain\r
frequencies that lead to differences in the turnover pa\u0002rameters. This is discussed in greater detail in Agazie\r
et al. (2023a).\r
F. SKY SCRAMBLES\r
In the sky-scramble method (Cornish & Sampson\r
2016), inter-pulsar correlations are analyzed as if the\r
pulsars occupied random sky positions, with the purpose\r
of creating a background distribution of PTA detection\r
statistics for null-hypothesis testing, in alternative to\r
phase shifts (Taylor et al. 2017; see §3 and §4). If a cor\u0002related signal is present in the data, phase shifts and sky\r
scrambles actually test different null hypotheses: phase\r
shifts test the hypothesis that no inter-pulsar correla\u0002tions are present, while sky scrambles assume that inter\u0002pulsar correlations are present at the level measured in\r
the data, but test the hypothesis that these correlations\r
have no dependence on angular separation.\r
As is the convention in the literature, we require that\r
scrambled overlap reduction functions (ORFs) be inde\u0002pendent of each other and of the unscrambled ORF us\u0002ing a match statistic,\r
M¯ =\r

ab\u0011\r
, (F5)\r
where Γab and Γ′\r
ab are two different ORFs. For the\r
sky scrambles used in our analysis, the scrambled ORFs\r
have M < ¯ 0.1 with respect to the unscrambled ORF,\r
and M < ¯ 0.17 with each other. We generate 10,000\r
sky scrambles, owing to the difficulty in obtaining large\r
numbers of scrambled ORFs that satisfy the match\r
threshold; because of limitations of computational re\u0002sources, we obtain our detection statistics for 5,000 of\r
those ORFs. Figure 14 shows the resulting background\r
distributions for the hdγ-to-curnγ Bayes factor (left\r
panel) and the optimal-statistic S/N (right panel). The\r
Bayes factors exceed the observed value in eight of the\r
5,000 sky scrambles (p = 1.6 × 10−3), while none of\r
the sky scrambles have noise-marginalized mean S/N\r
greater than observed (p < 10−4).\r
We note that the null distribution recovered by the\r
sky scrambles is not very sensitive to the choice of\r
match threshold for |M¯ | ≲ 0.2. Figure 15 compares\r
the null distributions when the match threshold for all\r
ORFs with each other and with the unscrambled ORF\r
is set to |M¯ | < 0.17 (blue), |M¯ | < 0.1 (orange), and\r
|M¯ | < 0.08 (green). There is very little difference among\r
the distributions; however, imposing a smaller thresh\u0002old means that fewer sky scrambles can be used (6,043\r
with |M¯ | < 0.1 and 1,534 with |M¯ | < 0.08, compared\r
to 10,000 with |M¯ | < 0.17), which limits the precision\r
with which the p-value can be measured. We find no\r
evidence that the recovered null distribution is biased\r
when including sky scrambles with matches up to 0.17.

G. MULTIPLE-CORRELATION OPTIMAL\r
STATISTIC\r
The multiple-correlation optimal statistic (MCOS;\r
Sardesai & Vigeland 2023) fits the inter-pulsar corre\u0002lation coefficients ρab with a linear model that includes\r
multiple components with different correlation patterns,\r
but with the same spectral shape. The linear-model co\u0002efficients are the squared amplitudes of the components.\r
Within such a model, the significance of each component\r
can be quoted as a S/N given by its best-fit coefficient di\u0002vided by the fit error. Just as for the noise-marginalized\r
optimal statistic (Vigeland et al. 2018), the posterior\r
distribution of pulsar noise parameters induces a distri\u0002bution of MCOS statistics.\r
We fit the 15-year data with models that include HD,\r
monopole, and dipole-correlated components in various\r
combinations. Table 2 lists the noise-marginalized am\u0002plitude estimates and S/N for all models. The goodness\u0002of-fit of the models can be compared using the Akaike\r
Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike 1998):\r
AIC = 2k + χ\r
2\r
, (G6)\r
where k is the number of model parameters and χ\r
2\r
is\r
the fit’s chi-squared, computed without accounting for\r
GW-induced ρab correlations. (This can be thought of\r
as a pseudo-Bayes factor, with the factor of 2k imposing\r
an Occam penalty.) The relative probability of a model\r
compared to the most-favored model is then given by\r
p(AIC) = exp [(AICmin − AIC)/2] , (G7)\r
where AICmin is the minimum AIC across all models.\r
Table 2 lists the AIC probabilities, computed by av\u0002eraging the AIC of each model over pulsar noise pa\u0002rameters. The HD-correlated model is preferred among"""

the precision to which the p-value can be measured.\r
the models with a single correlated process. The mod\u0002els with both HD and monopole correlations are pre\u0002ferred among all models: for a model with HD and\r
monopole correlations, we find S/N of 3.4 ± 0.8 for HD\r
correlations and 2.9 ± 0.8 for monopolar correlations,\r
while for a model with HD, monopole, and dipole cor\u0002relations, we find S/N of 2.9 ± 0.6 for HD correlations,\r
2.4 ± 0.6 for monopole correlations, and 0.6 ± 0.4 for\r
dipole correlations (means ± standard deviations across\r
noise-parameter posteriors). The statistical significance\r
of these S/Ns can be quantified empirically using sim\u0002ulations of 15-year–like data sets (see App. H.1), which\r
report p-values < 10−2 and ≃ 4 × 10−2for the observed\r
mean HD and monopole statistics across data replica\u0002tions with no spatially correlated injections.\r
As discussed in Sardesai & Vigeland (2023), the opti\u0002mal statistic and the MCOS are metrics of the apparent\r
spatial correlation pattern of the data, but they have\r
a limited ability to identify its actual source. That is\r
because a real HD signal may also excite the monopole\r
optimal statistic and the monopole component of the\r
MCOS; conversely, a real monopolar signal may also ex\u0002cite the HD optimal statistic and the HD component\r
of the MCOS; and so on. The S/Ns quoted in Table 2\r
quantify how often we would expect to measure the ob\u0002served value of the optimal statistic if only uncorrelated\r
noise is present, but they do not describe how often one\r
type of correlated noise would produce a given value of\r
the optimal statistic for a different type of correlation.\r

respectively. The monopolar component accounts for the\r
vertical shift of the cross-correlations with respect to the HD\r
curve. We use the standard version of the optimal statistic\r
that does not include inter-pulsar correlations to compute\r
ρab, so the points and errors do not match those shown in\r
panel (c) of Figure 1.\r
This effect can be characterized using simulations (see\r
App. H.1), which report a p-value of 0.11 for the ob\u0002served mean monopole statistic when a HD-correlated\r
signal with the MAP 15-year amplitude is included in\r
the simulated data sets. We conclude that there are\r
some indications of a possible monopole-correlated sig\u0002nal in the data with S/N comparable to but smaller than\r
the S/N for HD correlations; however, from simulations\r
we conclude that it is possible for such a signal to appear\r
in an MCOS analysis if only a HD-correlated stochastic\r
process is present.

STATISTIC SIMULATIONS\r
In this appendix we obtain the distribution of the\r
MCOS over an ensemble of simulated data sets, with\r
the goal of characterizing the probability that the ob\u0002served S/Ns could have been produced by pulsar noise\r
alone, or by a GWB with HD correlations. Unlike our\r
Bayesian analysis, the MCOS prefers a model that in\u0002cludes both HD and monopolar components. So we are\r
especially interested in asking how frequently we may\r
expect the observed MCOS monopole if the data con\u0002tain only the GWB. In Apps. H.1 and H.2 we present two\r
different types of simulations: “astrophysical,” where we\r
generate synthetic data with MAP noise parameters in\u0002ferred from the 15-year data set, both with and without\r
the GWB; and “model checking,” where we create data\r
replications following the hd13/3 posteriors for the real\r
data set. Note that neither simulation attempts to ac\u0002count for the monochromatic character of the putative\r
monopolar signal (see §5.2).\r

Following Pol et al. (2021), we generate simulated data\r
sets adopting MAP pulsar-noise parameters obtained\r
from the real data independently for each pulsar; these\r

lations: (i) injecting no spatially correlated power-law\r
GWB or excess uncorrelated common-spectrum noise;\r
(ii) injecting a spatially correlated power-law GWB with\r
amplitude 2.7×10−15 and spectral index 13/3; and (iii)\r
injecting no GWB or common-spectrum noise, but omit\u0002ting the additional power-law process in the estimation\r
of intrinsic pulsar noise, with the goal of testing how\r
often excess common-spectrum noise is recognized as a\r
spatially correlated GWB.\r
We compute HD + monopole + dipole MCOS S/Ns\r
for all synthetic data sets (see Figure 17). The mean\r
HD S/Ns observed in the real data (see App. G) corre\u0002spond to p-values of < 10−2\r
for simulations (i) and (iii),\r
and 0.64 for simulation (ii). The mean monopole S/Ns\r
observed in the real data set correspond to p-values of\r
4 × 10−2, 1.1 × 10−1, and < 10−2for simulations (i),\r
(ii), and (iii) respectively. We conclude that it is un\u0002likely that we would measure HD correlations at the\r
level observed in real data when no correlated signal\r
is present (simulation (i)) or when only uncorrelated\r
common-spectrum red noise is present (simulation (iii)).\r
In addition, the HD S/Ns obtained from a HD-correlated\r
GWB injection (simulation (ii)) are fully consistent with\r
the S/N observed in real data. By contrast, the observed\r
monopole S/N could have been produced by intrinsic\r
pulsar noise alone, or by a real HD signal.\r
H.2. Model-checking simulations\r
In App. H.1 we have tackled the question of monopole\r

a stronger Bayesian flavor, evaluating the MCOS on\r
a population of data replications created using hd13/3\r
as a generative model with noise hyperparameters η\r
drawn from the hd13/3real-data posterior. This can be\r
seen also as a Bayesian model-checking exercise (Gelman\r
et al. 1996, 2013): if we find that the summary statis\u0002tic of interest (the monopole MCOS) has a much more\r
extreme value in real data than in data replications,\r
we should suspect that the data model (here hd13/3)\r
is missing something.\r
We perform the test by drawing 500 parameter vectors\r
{η\r
(k)} from the hd13/3\r
real-data posterior; for each η\r
(k)\r
we simulate a data set δtsim,(k) ∼ p(δt|η\r
(k)\r
) and com\u0002pare MCOS(δtsim,(k)\r
; η\r
(k)\r
) with MCOS(δt; η\r
(k)\r
). Our\r
notation emphasizes the dependence of the MCOS on\r
the pulsar noise parameters through the P matrices in\r
Equation 9. Figure 18 shows the resulting distribution\r
of monopole S/Ns. The replicated monopole S/N is\r
greater than its observed counterpart for 11% of the\r
draws. Thus, it is plausible that the MCOS could mea\u0002sure the observed monopole S/N in data that contain\r
only a HD-correlated GWB. Conversely, the observed\r
monopole S/N does not by itself suggest that hd13/3is\r
misspecified."""
