Automorphisms of Sedenions\r
G. P. Wilmot\r

Abstract\r
This paper extends the seven-dimensional Fano plane to a 15-dimensional\r
Fano volume, which is related to sedenions. The Fano plane visualises the\r
octonions and their structure as seven quaternions and is derived from a\r
calibration in differential geometry. Clifford algebra allows the Spin and\r
Pin groups to fully analyse calibrations and a new calibration is created\r
that derives the Fano volume, which provides a visualisation of the complete\r
subalgebra structure of sedenions.\r
This new 15-dimensional calibration, along with the existing one contain\u0002ing 35 quaternions, enables an explicit derivation of the automorphisms of\r
sedenions matching Schafer’s result and hence addresses a discrepancy in the\r
literature. Also, Gresnigt has suggested extending Furey’s work on quark\r
and lepton families using octonions to three octonion subalgebras of sede\u0002nions. The Fano volume allows this process to avoid the power-associative\r
subalgebras of sedenions. It is conjectured that Fano hyper-volumes will\r
uncover the complete subalgebra structure of all Cayley-Dickson algebras.\r
Keywords. Clifford algebras, octonions, sedenions, Cayley-Dickson alge\u0002bras, calibrations, power-associative algebras, Fano volume.\r
1 Introduction\r
The series of Cayley-Dickson algebras, An, provides 2\r
n basis elements generated by\r
n generators at each level, n ≥ 0. The series starts with the reals, A0\r
∼= R, complex\r
numbers, A1\r
∼= C, quaternions, A2∼= H, octonions, A3∼= O, followed by the\r
sedenions, A4\r
∼= S. The series has increasingly complicated norms until sedenions\r
and all An, for n ≥ 4, which have zero divisors, hence they are power-associative\r
and can not be normed algebras. Because of this, until recently, they have been\r
avoided by physists as not being appropriate for reality. Mathematicians have\r
struggled with the analysis of these algebras with some support for the alternate\r
rule, which has been shown to be invalid [1, 2], and finding different embeddings\r
of Lie algebras in the automorphisms of An, for n ≥ 4.\r
The Lie algebras were formulated and classified by Killing and Cartan [4] and\r
the smallest exceptional Lie algebra, G2, was shown by Engel to be the auto\u0002morphisms of octonions, Aut(O) ∼= G2 [5]. Schafer [6] found that Aut(S)\r
?∼= G2\r
while, subsequently, Brown [7] found that Aut(S)\r
?∼= G2 × S3. This discrepency is\r
analysed extensively in this paper with the main result being a new calibration\r
that allows the enumeration of the automorphisms of sedenions. This analysis\r
arXiv:2512.07210v1 [math.RA] 8 Dec 2025

supports Schafer to find that Aut(S) ∼= G2 but also highlights the complications\r
for power-associative algebras.\r
A graded notation is used for both Clifford and Cayley-Dickson algebras, but\r
for different reasons. The Cl(n) algebras naturally represent the same geometric\r
objects as Grassmann’s exterior algebra and the grading follows that of differential\r
geometry. The An algebras are not directly related to geometry but the doubling\r
rule that defines the algebra [8] introduces a new generator at each level with the\r
binomial expansion of all generators providing the grading, as explained in the\r
following.\r
Definition. The basis of the Clifford algebra will be denoted as Cl(n) = heα : α ∈\r
{∅, 1, 2, . . . , n, 12, 13, . . . , 12 . . . n}i so that eα is isomorphic to Grassmann’s exterior\r
algebra and are called forms. The basis of the Cayley-Dickson algebra is denoted\r
as An = hoα : α ∈ {∅, 1, 2, . . . , n, 12, 13, . . . , 12 . . . n}i but this is not isomorphic to\r
the exterior algebra due to multiplication defined by the doubling rule [8]. Unity\r
is used in both algebras as e∅ = o∅ = 1 and e\r
2\r
i = 1 and o\r
2\r
i = −1 for i ∈ N\r
n\r
1\r
, using\r
Porteous’s notation [9] for a subset of natural numbers. The grading of these\r
algebras exposes the XOR multiplication operation and enforces the ordering of\r
the basis elements given by the above expansion for Cl(n) but using the doubling\r
rule for An [2].\r

Figure 1: Directed 2-simplex\r
The vector φ3 = e1+e2+e3 in three-dimensional Clifford algebra, Cl(3), can be\r
interpreted as a representation of the vertices of the 2-simplex shown in Figure 1.\r
The dual in Clifford algebra is found by multiplying any form by the negated\r
pseudoscalar, φ\r
∗\r
3 = −e123φ3 = −e12 + e13 − e23, which can represent the edges of\r
the directed simplex. The terms of the dual along with unity, 1, form a subalgebra\r
of Cl(3), the even subalgebra Cl+(3) isomorphic to the quaternions, and because\r
e123 is imaginary, including the terms of Φ3 and e123, we form a basis of Cl(3)\r
as complex quaternions, Cl(3) ≡ C ⊗ H. The Spin(n) group is defined as an\r
even product of unit length vectors in Cl(n) so is a subset of Cl+(n) [8] and is a\r
double covering of the special orthogonal group due to rotations being conjugate\r
operations. The Pin(n) group is defined as an odd number of unit vectors but to\r
be consistent with the general orthogonal group the even vectors are included so\r
Pin(n) is a subgroup of the invertible Clifford group, Cl∗(n).\r
Definition. A calibration [8], Φ, in differential geometry is a p-form on a subset,\r
U, of R\r
n\r
satisfying dΦ = 0 on U and has maximum one for any point in U on\r
the grassmannian of oriented p-dimensional subspaces of ΛR\r
n\r
. An associative\r
calibration consists of associative 3-forms that correspond to associative algebras.\r
2

Hence the basis vector φ3 is a 1-form calibration and the 3-form in Cl(3) is an\r
associative calibration. These trivially satisfy the definition for calibrations and are\r
analysed here to demonstrate mappings from the quaternions in Clifford algebra\r
to the quaternions in Cayley-Dickson algebras, which will serve as an illustration\r
for higher dimensions.\r
Definition. The 3-form calibration in Cl(3) defines a map from Cl(3) to A2, the\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra with two generators, as\r
e123 : {(e1, e2, e3) → (o1, o2, o12)}, (1)\r
where o1\r
2 = o22 = o122 = −1, o1o2o12 = −1, o1o2 = o12, are associative and they\r
all anti-commute so A2 is isomorphic to the quaternions, H. The name of the\r
map defines the domain by associativity, e123 = e1e2e3, and parity as shown for the\r
directed face of Cl(3) in Figure 1. The dual Clifford algebra multiplies any element\r
by the negated pseudoscalar, which in Cl(3) is the following map that generates\r
the quaternions in Cl(3),\r
e123\r
∗\r
: {(e1, e2, e3) −→ (e23, e13, e12)}.\r
In general, an associative calibration admits a map from independent faces of a\r
simplex to quaternions in a Cayley-Dickson algebra, where independent means the\r
faces only touch in vertices.\r
A map that changes the order, e213 : {(e2, e1, e3) → (o2, o1, o12)}, keeps the\r
properties of equation (1) apart from having odd parity with o2o1o12 = +1, which\r
is isomorphic to an algebra sometimes called the anti-quaternions. Alternatively,\r
the map that changes the sign of one term, σ : {(e1, e2, −e3) → (o1, o2, −o12)}, also\r
satisfies −o1o2o12 = 1. So the parity e213 = −e123 = σ is an important property.\r
For example, e123 : {e12, e23} → {o1o2, o2o12} = {o12, o1} and, as a conjugate\r
rotation with R =\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o12)(1 + o1), is R(o1 + o2 + o12)R−1 = o1 + o2 + o12. This\r
is a demonstration of quaternions being their own automorphisms and even parity\r
rotations keeping the parity invariant.\r
Definition. The Spin elements that keep a calibration invariant in Cl(n) up to\r
parity will be called invariants. It will be found that only some invariants are au\u0002tomorphisms of subalgebras of the Spin group and of the corresponding mapped\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra. Negations of the invariants and the identity will be ex\u0002cluded.\r
Definition. A triad refers to a triple of Cayley-Dickson basis elements that are\r
distinct and pure, or non-scalar. The ordered associator for a triad is defined as\r
[a, b, c] = (ab)c−a(bc), for a < b < c in the ordering provided by the grading [2]. If\r
[a, b, c] = 0 then the triad is called associative. Quaternions and anti-quaternions\r
are associative.\r
Now consider the octonions, O, which have seven embedded quaternions and\r
28 non-associative products giving \r
7\r
3\r
\u0001\r
= 35 triads. Analogously to the map from\r
Cl(3) to H, we introduce a map from Cl(7) to O,\r
e1234567 : {(e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7) −→ (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, −o123)}. (2)\r

The quaternions in this map are described by the following calibration in Cl(7) [3,\r
8, 10], with the index 64 denoting the negation of the last three terms,\r
θ64 = e123 + e145 + e167 + e246 − e257 − e347 − e356.\r
This is illustrated by the Fano plane diagram, Figure 2, where the arrows corre\u0002spond to quaternions rather than anti-quaternions. Note that the negated term is\r
needed to satisfy this condition. The number of 90◦rotations in Cl(7) is \r
7\r
2\r
\u0001\r
= 21\r
and each any set of these applied to θ64 generates another calibration. Extending\r
equation (1) to 7-dimensional maps to embedded quaternions, eijk, for terms of\r
θ64, then this covers all rotations in Cl(7) so provides a bijective map from Spin(7)\r
to O.\r

Figure 2: Fano plane diagram\r
It was shown in [3] that an invertible form can be created from this calibration\r
in Cl(7), as\r
(3e1234567 + θ64)\r
2 = −16. (3)\r
The dual Clifford algebra multiplies each term with the negated pseudoscalar in\r
Cl(7), e1234567, which, for the calibration θ64 defines the co-associative calibration,\r
θ\r
∗\r
64 = −e1234567θ64\r
= −e1247 − e1256 − e1346 + e1357 + e2345 + e2367 + e4567.\r
(4)\r
The 3-form with all positive terms, called the primary, is denoted\r
θ1 = e123 + e145 + e167 + e246 + e257 + e347 + e356.\r
Under the map e1234567 this does not map to octonions but to another algebra\r
which is power-associative. It still has a Fano plane representation but with ar\u0002rows that are inconsistent with the product rules of octonions. One might be\r
tempted to call this an anti-octonion algebra but there are six such algebras, Pk,\r
k ∈ {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}, where k denotes the number of non-associative triads.\r
Rotations and reflections of θ1 can be used to generate all Pk algebras [3]. Al\u0002though O has 28 non-associative triads it is not added as the case k = 28 in the\r
series because it is not power-associative. All of these seven algebras are called\r
octonion-like algebras herein. The question is how can these algebras have less than\r
28 non-associative triads when they consist of seven quaternion-like subalgebras.\r
Definition. The associator is extended in [2] to an unordered associator that\r
defines four non-associative types, shown below with a < b < c, where ⋆ denotes a\r
non-zero value.\r

Associativity Non-Associativity [b, a, c] [a, b, c] [a, c, b]\r
⋆ 0 0 Type A\r
0 ⋆ 0 Type B\r
0 0 ⋆ Type C\r
⋆ ⋆ ⋆ Type X\r
We can now relate this to the non-associativity cardinality of the octonion\u0002like algebras. The standard associator counts both Type B and Type X non\u0002associativity, which may be considered as symmetric associators. Octonions have\r
28 Type X triads and all Pk have four Type X triads. The Pk have increasing\r
cardinality of Type B as shown in Table 1, which also provides θ1 with sign changes\r
and rotations to provide the map that generates the algebra. It was shown in [2]\r
that all Type A triads and half of Type B generate zero-divisor pairs so Table 1\r
shows that all Pk have 12 zero divisor pairs thus generating power-associativity.\r

P16 6 12 6 4 e125 + e134 + e167 + e236 + e247 + e357 + e456\r
It is interesting to note that [2] found that only Pk for k ∈ {4, 12, 14} occur\r
as subalgebras in any Cayley-Dickson algebra. Table 1 shows that the associative\r
3-forms for these three algebras correspond to sign variations of θ1, the first of 30\r
representations of octonions presented in [3]. The Pk for k = {8, 10, 16} do not\r
appear in the first associative 3-form representation and maybe this is the reason\r
only P4, P12 and P14 occur in Cayley-Dickson algebras. Unfortunately, although\r
P12 and P14 appear in all 30 representations, it was found that P4 is missing from\r
the second group of six representations whereas P8 and P16 are missing from half\r
of the representations and P10 is missing from just two of the groups of six found\r
in the 30 associative 3-form representations.\r
2 Sedenion Calibrations\r
The sedenions contain 35 quaternions [3], as shown in the associative calibration\r
Θ, and each minus sign in Θ corresponds to a minus sign above the diagonal of the\r
sedenion multiplication table, Table 2. The seven terms in θ64 from Cl(7) generate\r
the 7-dimensional octonions in the top left hand quarter of the table. The table\r
corresponds to that used by Cawagas [11] and the signs of Θ are selected to match\r
the representation but the calibration could be used to generate the table given\r
that every edge of the 14-simplex or 90◦rotation in Spin(15) is referenced in Θ,\r

Cawagas [11, 12] found from loop analysis that eight octonions and seven P4\r
representations are embedded in the sedenions. Hence the count of symmetric\r
non-associative triads matches the count for each octonion-like subalgebras, 252 =\r
8 × 28 + 7 × 4. These loops, provided here in reduced triad form that generate\r
the 7-cycle, were found in [2] and are replicated here as φO and φP , representing\r
octonion and P4 representations, respectively,\r
φO =((o1, o2, o3),(o1, o2, o4),(o1, o3, o4),(o1, o23, o4),\r
(o2, o3, o4),(o2, o13, o4),(o12, o3, o4),(o12, o13, o4))\r
φP =((o1, o2, o34),(o1, o3, o24),(o1, o23, o24),(o2, o3, o14),\r
(o2, o13, o14),(o12, o3, o14),(o12, o13, o14)).\r
(5)\r
Introducing hexadecimal notation for the indices in 15 dimensions, the map\r
from Cl(15) to a basis of S is defined as\r
e123456789ABCDEF : (e1, e2, . . . , eF) −→ (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, o123, o4,\r
o14, o24, o124, o34, o134, o234, o1234).\r
(6)\r
This map is derived from Θ and unlike (2) has all positive signs to match S. For\r
example, e167 → o1o23 = −o123 so that e167 is negated in Θ but o123 is negated in\r
(2).\r
The inverse map applied to the triads of φO and φP can be used to define\r
7-forms by first expanding the triads in (5) to the seven terms of each loop. For\r
example, (o1, o2, o3) → (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, o123), which is inverse mapped to\r
e1234567. This represents the 7-dimensional octonion in the top left-hand quarter\r
of Table 2 and is denoted ΦA. The equivalent process applied to the remaining\r
6

terms gives,\r
ΦO = e12389AB + e14589CD + e16789EF\r
+ e2468ACE + e2578ADF + e3478BCF + e3568BDE\r
ΦP = e123CDEF + e145ABEF + e167ABCD + e2469BDF\r
+ e2579BCE + e3479ADE + e3569ACF.\r
(7)\r
Any three indices of ΦA or terms of ΦO mapped as basis elements by (6) that\r
are not quaternion generate octonions and any three mapped ΦP term indices,\r
not quaternion or X non-associative, generate the corresponding P4 representa\u0002tion. The 7-dimensional calibration has the property that ρ =\r
1\r
4\r
(3e1234567 + θ64) is\r
invertible, ρ\r
2 = −1 and in 15 dimensions we expect an analogous situation.\r
Theorem 1. The 7-form Φ = ΦA + ΦO + ΦP , is an invertible calibration with\r
invertible form ψ, ψ\r
2 = −1, where\r
ψ =\r
1\r
8\r
(7e123456789ABCDEF − Φ).\r
The calibration Φ generates sedenions under the mapping (6).\r
Proof. Note that ΦO consists of the terms of θ64 multiplied by e8 and the corre\u0002sponding term of a complimentary space calibration, with imaginary e9ABCDEF,\r
θ\r
′\r
64 = e9AB + e9CD + e9EF + eACE − eADF − eBCF − eBDE.\r
Multiplying by terms of ΦO acts on the terms of θ64 and θ\r
′\r
64 separately with\r
imaginaries e1234567 and e9ABCDEF so that multiplying the results by e123456789ABCDEF\r
returns the terms to ΦO. Hence ΦO is invertible with the same form as (3), apart\r
from the signs that are cancelled by the complimentary space term. The invertible\r
form is given by\r
(3e123456789ABCDEF − ΦO)\r
2 = −16. (8)\r
This invertible form, looking at each term, relates to ΦP as\r
e89ABCDEFΦO = ΦP , (9)\r
where e1234567e89ABCDEF = e123456789ABCDEF and e1234567 commutes with ΦO and ΦP ,\r
which means e89ABCDEF does too. We start by expanding ΦO in (8) as\r
Φ\r
2\r
O = 9 + 6e123456789ABCDEFΦO − 16\r
= −7 + 6e123456789ABCDEFΦO.\r
and substituting this and (9) into (8ψ)\r
2\r
, gives\r
64ψ\r
2 = (7e123456789ABCDEF − e1234567 − (1 + e89ABCDEF)ΦO)2\r
= −49 − 1 + 2(1 + e89ABCDEF)Φ2\r
O − 14e123456789ABCDEF(e1234567\r
+ (1 + e89ABCDEF)ΦO) + 2e1234567(1 + e89ABCDEF)ΦO\r
= − 50 − 2(1 + e89ABCDEF)(7 − 6e123456789ABCDEFΦO)\r
+ 14e89ABCDEF − 12(e123456789ABCDEF + e1234567)ΦO\r
= − 50 − 14 − 14e89ABCDEF + 12(e123456789ABCDEF + e1234567)ΦO\r
+ 14e89ABCDEF − 12(e123456789ABCDEF + e1234567)ΦO\r
= −64,\r
7

so that ψ\r
2 = −1. Since Φ shares each basis vector of Cl(15) seven times and each\r
quaternion in Θ three times then it is a calibration. Finally, the map (6) takes\r
the first, second and fourth indices of each term of Φ to the appropriate triad in\r
(5) that were shown in [2] to have X non-associativity for ΦO terms and A non\u0002associativity for ΦP terms thus generating all the subalgebras of sedenions.\r

The invertible property of ψ is related to the fact that 1\r
16 (1+Φ∗\r
) is an idempotent,\r
1+Φ∗ =\r
1\r
2\r
(1+ e12478BDE)(1+ e12479ACF)(1+ e12568BCF)(1+ e12569ADE)(1+ e13468ADF).\r
Here the first five terms of Φ\r
∗ have been turned into idempotents, such as 1\r
2\r
(1 +\r
e12478BDE), and five idempotents multiplied to recover 2(1 + Φ∗). Almost any\r
five terms of Φ\r
∗\r
constructed in this way has this result. Of the \r
15\r
5\r
\u0001\r
= 3003\r
combinations, only 315 do not satisfy this condition.\r
Definition. The 15 terms of Φ will be identified as Φi with Φ1 = ΦA, i ∈ N\r
8\r
2\r
corresponding to the terms of ΦO and i ∈ N\r
15\r
9\r
corresponding to those of ΦP . These\r
will be related to subsets of terms of 3Θ labelled Θi and provided in Table 3. Each\r
of the quaternions in Θ are embedded three times in Φ so that P15\r
i=1 Θi = 9Θ. The\r
correspondence between the 8-form and 3-form representations of octonions is\r
Θ\r
3\r
i =\r
(\r
−43Θi − 42Φi, for i ∈ N\r
8\r
1\r
, or\r
−19Θi + 6Φi + 24θ, for i ∈ N\r
15\r
9\r
.\r
This is derived from the fact that the 3-form octonions are invertible from (3)\r
in the form (3Φi + Θi)\r
2 = −16. The 3-form P4 representations are not invertible\r
but have a remainder [3] represented by θ above, which is one of the terms from Θi\r
.\r
Building the multiplication table for each 3-form and finding 28 or 4 Type B and\r
X non-associative triads identifies O or P4 classes, respectively [2], as identified in\r
Table 3. The graphical depiction of the Fano planes as faces, internal planes or\r
cones is provided later in Figure 4, which demonstrates the three fold embedding of\r
quaternions in the octonion-like subalgebras of sedenions. Gresnigt [13] uses such\r
sharing of quaternions to represent 3-fermion colours but care must be taken to\r
choose a quaternion not represented in φP , as the zero divisors in one representation\r
of a fermion would make the fermion families unsymmetrical. From Figure 3, such\r
quaternions that are triply shared by octonions must include e8, which excludes\r
the 7-dimensional Fano plane on the bottom of the Fano volume in Figure 4. The\r
alternative is to use the third Cayley-Dickson power-associative algebra, which\r
contains three pseudo-octonion algebras, and look for quaternions spanning three\r
power-associative subalgebras.\r

3 Non-Associative Calibrations\r
Theorem 2 (Algebra stacking). Each Cayley-Dickson algebra of n generators\r
consists of 2\r
n − 1 embedded subalgebras with n − 1 generators that consist of Hn−1\r
embedded quaternions or anti-quaternions, where Hn = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)/6.\r
Proof. Each Cayley-Dickson algebra of n generators embeds Hn quaternions and\r
Tn = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n − 4)/168 octonion-like algebras [2]. Each octonion-like\r
algebra has seven associative or quaternion-like subalgebras, hence the number of\r
quaternions shared between each octonion-like algebra is\r
7Tn\r
Hn\r
=\r
6(2n − 4)\r
24\r
= 2n−2 − 1, for n > 2.\r
This is three for sedenions so that the quaternions in Θ match the quaternions\r
in Φ, 35 = 15 × 7/3. The quaternion-like subalgebras shared amongst octonion\u0002like subalgebras must also be shared amongst other larger subalgebras that cover\r
the algebra so that dividing the shared quaternion-like subalgebras in the algebra\r
of n generators with the quaternions for n − 1 generators gives the number of\r
embeddings of the largest subalgebra for n > 1,\r
Hn(2n−2 − 1)/Hn−1 = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n−2 − 1)/(2n−1 − 1)(2n−1 − 2)\r
= (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n − 4)/(2n − 2)(2n − 4)\r
= 2n − 1.\r
This sequence starts with the result that C is embedded three times within\r
H, seven quaternions are in octonions and 15 octonion-like algebras in sedenions.\r
These embedded algebras can be found by first constructing the first quaternion\r
calibration in Cl(2n − 1), n > 2 by hand. It is easiest to extend the calibration\r
3-form in Cl(2n−1 − 1), n > 3 using the rule all pairs of indices can only appear\r
9

once. Then taking odd powers of this calibration until Nn-forms appear, where\r
Nn = 2n−1 − 1 and selecting the subset of these that only share quaternions\r
2\r
n−1 −1 times. These Nn-forms extend Nn−1-forms of the calibration of Cl(Nn). If\r
these calibrations, like the 8-form calibration in Cl(15), form a projection operator\r
then this can only happen if the terms of the dual form a closed algebra under\r
multiplication and the following definition is justified.\r
Definition. The terms of the dual of the Nn−1-form calibration in Cl(Nn) where\r
Nn = 2n−1, along with unity, 1, form a subalgebra of Spin(Nn) in Cl(Nn) denoted\r
Spin♯(Nn). The terms of the calibration and the imaginary pseudoscalar in Cl(Nn),\r
along with Spin♯\r
(Nn) form a subalgebra of Pin(Nn) denoted Pin♯(Nn). These\r
algebras are called sharp algebras. The Spin♯(Nn) consists of even forms and\r
Pin♯(Nn) consists of both even and odd forms.\r
Lemma 1 (Conjecture). The terms of Spin♯\r
(Nn) act on Pin♯(Nn) to swap Nn−1\r
pairs of odd-forms between themselves and Nn−1 pairs of even-forms between them\u0002selves. Hence, under conjugation, these are related to automorphisms of Spin♯\r
(Nn),\r
the Nn−1-form calibration and the original 3-form quaternion calibration of Hn\r
terms. The latter case implies the Spin♯\r
(Nn) terms are related to automorphisms\r
of the Cayley-Dickson algebra with n generators.\r
This lemma is left as a conjecture for n > 4 but is trivial for n = 1, 2, has been\r
validated in [3] for n = 3 (O) and the first part has been shown to be true for n = 4\r
(S) in Section 2. The remainer of the paper considers the relationship to sedenion\r
automorphisms. Note that Spin♯(1) ∼= R and the basis of Pin♯(1) is {1, e123} so\r
that Pin♯(1) ∼= C. Also Spin♯(3) ∼= H and Pin♯(3) ∼= Cl(3). It is interesting to\r
note that the Spin♯(Nn) algebras have the same cyclic structure of the equivalent\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra but are commutative and the basis elements square to\r
unity.\r
The octonion case uses the pure basis of Spin♯(7) with terms provided by θ64 in\r
(4) that was shown in [3] to be a subalgebra of Spin(7). It acts on Pin♯\r
(7) under\r
conjugation to swap three pairs of terms of θ\r
∗\r
64 and for the odd pair it swaps three\r
pairs of terms of θ64 amongst themselves. Since this act invariantly on θ64 it does\r
the same on O.\r
For sedenions, multiplying Φ by Φ\r
∗\r
i will swap seven pairs of 8-forms in Φ\r
∗ and\r
seven pairs of 7-forms in Φ, which is summarised in Table 4. From (7), ΦO terms\r
contain e8 whereas ΦA and ΦP terms do not. So multiplying by Φ\r
∗\r
A = e89ABCDEF\r
swaps all of ΦO and ΦP . Multiplying by a member of Φ\r
∗\r
P\r
, Φ\r
∗\r
i\r
, i ∈ N\r
15\r
8\r
, will also\r
swap between ΦO and ΦP apart from Φi, which becomes the pseudoscalar while\r
it’s partner, given by (9), becomes e1234567. The analogous situation occurs when\r
multiplying by Φ\r
∗\r
i\r
, i ∈ N\r
8\r
2\r
, where a member of ΦP swaps with ΦA but all other\r
swaps remain within their class.\r

Another way of seeing this is that each quaternion shares three octonion-like\r
subalgebras and vice versa, and any two octonion-like algebras share one quater\u0002nion, as seen in the Fano volume, Figure 4. Because each term of the calibration,\r
Φ, share three indices, then products of these terms cancel the shared indices leav\u0002ing an 8-form, which is the dual of the third Fano plane shared by the quaternion.\r
This is analogous to the octonion where any two quaternion subalgebras share a\r
vertix of the Fano plane and multiplying these two generates the dual of the third\r
quaternion shared by the vertex.\r
4 Sedenion Automorphisms\r
Brown [7] defines three transformations that define the automorphisms of a Cayley\u0002Dickson algebra with n generators, An, from those of An−1. The first transforma\u0002tion for a, b ∈ An−1 and σ ∈ Aut(An−1), is\r
σ\r
′\r
: a + bon → aσ + (bσ)on. (11)\r
The second transformation is the conjugate of on, which gives\r
Aut(An−1) × S2 ⊆ Aut(An),\r
where S2 is the symmetric group of order 2. The third equation is applied under\r
certain conditions and is interpreted as 60◦rotations of a and bon by Gresnigt [13].\r
This is claimed by both authors to mean, for n ∈ 4, 5, 6, that\r
Aut(An−1) × S3 = Aut(An).\r
But any single rotation from e1234567 to e9ABCDEF changes the e1234567 term of ΦO\r
to an inconsistent term so can’t be an automorphism.\r
Schafer‘[6] previously derived that the automorphisms for all Cayley-Dickson\r
algeras, An, t > 2, are the same. Hence\r
Aut(An) = G2, for n > 2.\r
To re-consider this discrepancy, the calibration approach of octonions is extended\r
to sedenions.\r
The 21 elements of G2 were provided in [3] in terms of pairs of Spin(7) ele\u0002ments called the effective algebra, Spin♯\r
(7). From Lemma 1, the terms of (4) are\r
invariants of θ64 and the three ordered pairs of the indices of any 4-form term of\r
θ\r
∗\r
64 generate three rotations each, which act as a subset of the invariant action of\r
Spin♯(7) on θ64, so are also invariants [3]. Cycling through all three rotations as\r
combinations of 2-form pairs in any term of θ\r
∗\r
64 swaps all three combinations of\r
3-form pairs having the same effect as the 4-form swapping three pairs of 3-forms.\r
These 21 pairs of rotations are the basis of G2, which provides the assignment\r
G2 = Spin♯(7) ⊗ Z3. Algebra G2 has 14 independent basis elements shown in\r
Table 5 [3] for the representation of e3568BDE.\r
Theorem 3. The invariants of Φ under 90◦rotations are given by two maps of\r
each term of Φ\r
∗\r
in (10). The first, based upon the G2 map for each half of the\r
8-forms, is\r
eµ1µ2µ3µ4µ5µ6µ7µ8 −→(eµ1µ2 + eµ3µ4 + eµ5µ6 + eµ7µ8,\r
eµ1µ3 + eµ2µ4 + eµ5µ7 + eµ6µ8,\r
eµ1µ4 + eµ2µ3 + eµ5µ8 + eµ6µ7).\r

eµ1µ7 + eµ2µ8 + eµ3µ5 + eµ4µ6,\r
eµ1µ8 + eµ2µ7 + eµ3µ6 + eµ4µ5).\r
(13)\r
With positive terms the invariants are called primary invariants. These provide 105\r
primary invariants and we now consider paired negation of terms, which preserve\r
the parity. Applying the map (6) shows that some invariants are automorphisms\r
and some need sign changes to become automorphisms of sedenions. Such sign\r
changes have been evaluated and are shown in the five tables, which provides 105\r
automorphisms of S. Negativing the last two terms also provides automorphisms\r
eµ1µ2 + eµ3µ4 + eµ5µ6 + eµ7µ8 −→ (eµ1µ2 + eµ3µ4 + eµ5µ6 + eµ7µ8,\r
eµ1µ2 + eµ3µ4 − eµ5µ6 − eµ7µ8,\r
eµ1µ2 − eµ3µ4 + eµ5µ6 − eµ7µ8,\r
eµ1µ2 − eµ3µ4 − eµ5µ6 + eµ7µ8),\r
quadrupling the size of each table to generate 420 invariants of Φ.\r
Proof. The first map, (12), is identical to (11) which was proved by Brown [7]\r
for ΦO. This needs to be extended to cover e1234567 and ΦP . The second map.\r
(13), extends the first map to cover all groups of two of the eight indices of each\r
Spin♯(15) term (apart from the scalar). But the constraint is that once eµ1µi,\r
i ∈ N\r
8\r
1\r
is selected from eµ1µ2µ3µ4µ5µ6µ7µ8, then if i ≤ 4 the second term must also\r
select from indices µ3 and µ4 in N\r
4\r
2\r
, to keep Φ\r
∗\r
in (10) consistent, or if i > 4\r
then the second term must have µ3 ∈ N\r
4\r
2 and µ4 ∈ N\r
8\r
5\r
for the same reason. This\r
means that the first term, eµ1µifor i ∈ N\r
8\r
2\r
governs the solution and there are only\r
seven primary invariants for each term in Φ\r
∗\r
, giving a total of 105 before the sign\r
variations are applied.\r
Unlike Spin♯(7), the parity can cancel under the map (6) so all even permuta\u0002tions of the four 90◦\r
rotation 2-forms should be considered. Half of these permu\u0002tations will be negations of the other half so only four need be considered. Thus\r
there are 420 invariants of the Spin♯(15) and Pin♯(15) algebras. These sign varia\u0002tions can be juggled to provide closure under the Lie product. The first map, (12),\r
applied to Φ\r
∗\r
O was based on G2 so it is appropriate to duplicate the signs in Table 5\r
to 15 dimensions, as shown in Table 6. This forms a 15-dimensional representation\r
of G2. The other components of Φ will be considered separately.\r

Definition. Theorem 2 finds three cyclic, (12), and four mixed, (13), invariants of\r
Φ. These are identified as Φ\r
C and ΦM, respectively, and together denoted ΦA. The\r
theorem also finds four sign variations as (+, +, +, +), (+, +, −, −), (+, −, +, −),\r
(+, −, −, +), which are denoted as Φ\r
A = ΦA(1)\r
, Φ\r
A(2)\r
, Φ\r
A(3)\r
, Φ\r
A(4), respectively.\r
Hence the total number of signed invariants are denoted as Φ\r
A(1+2+3+4) or parts\r
thereof, as appropriate.\r
All of the first sign variation invariants are provided in the Appendix. Like\r
Table 6, these are shown with signs juggled to provide closure under the Lie product\r
with themselves. The full 21 invariants of G2, Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
, are shown in Table 10 and the\r
21 invariants of Φ\r
(1)\r
P\r
are provided in Table 11. The second map, which in general\r

are\r
shown in Table 12 and those from Φ\r

The action of the invariants is a subset of the multiplication by Φ\r

due to the invariants being composed of four rotations, as shown in Table 7. The\r

O invariant terms that map to o4. Since o4 is mapped\r
from e8 in (6) then such invariants do not rotate octonion components within ΦO.\r

acts on Φ differently.\r

provides a double covering of G2. Also Φ\r

O provides a quadruple cover of G2.\r
This table also shows a quadruple covering of the algebra generated by Φ\r

A but\r
only a double covering of Φ\r

P\r
. The mixed Lie products of ΦO and ΦP generate\r

These candidates are seen as three disconnected domains in the summary of the\r
Lie product tables, (14). The only consistent Lie product between them is between\r
Φ\r
C(2+4)\r
O\r
and Φ\r
C(2+3)\r
P\r
. But the Φ\r
C(3)\r
P\r
term generates Φ\r
C(4)\r
P\r
, which is shown to be\r
inconsistent in Table 8 so is excluded and the other product generates Φ\r
C(3)\r
P\r
so is\r
also excluded. These three domains act on Pin♯(15) in separate ways.\r
All sign variations, Φ\r
A\r
A, are invariants of Φ but not of Θ. Only Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
are\r
invariants of Θ. Under the mapping e123456789ABCDEF, Φ\r

O\r
, Φ\r
A\r
A and Φ\r
C\r
P\r
, rotate\r
Θ to another parity that still maps to sedenions, but with a different representation.\r
The Φ\r
M\r
O and Φ\r
M\r
P\r
rotate Θ to a parity that maps to other power-associative 15-\r
dimensional algebras, not S but these have already been excluded. Changing Θ\r
but keeping consistent the quaternion parity may be considered as automorphisms\r
of the sharp algebra but that provides disconnected domains so we are forced to\r
choose\r
Aut(Spin♯\r
(15))\r
?∼= Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
∼= G2.\r
This argument does not apply to the automorphisms of sedenions since changes of\r
representation of Θ is acceptable. This is now investigated further.\r
The octonion automorphisms were generated using the basis of Spin♯(7), called\r
the enabling algebra [3], because is was used to derive the exceptional Lie algebra\r
G2 by considering rotations of 90◦in Cl(7),\r
Rij = (cos π\r
2\r
+ eij sin\r
π\r
2\r
) = (1 + eij)/\r
√\r
2.\r
Double 90◦rotations derived from Spin♯(7) were separated into commuting and\r
anticommuting parts when applied to the calibration and the second part was\r
found to define G2 because they had the same action as that of the double rotation.\r
Since the rotations kept the calibration invariant then the anticommuting terms\r
were automorphisms of Pin♯(7) and are found here to map under e1234567 to the\r
kernel of octonions and hence are automorphisms of octonions.\r
Here we state the equivalent results for Spin♯(15) by considering quadruple 90◦\r
rotations, R = RijRklRmnRop for eijklmnop being a member of Φ\r
∗\r
,\r
R = (1 + eij)(1 + ekl)(1 + emn)(1 + eop)/4\r
= (1 + eij + ekl + emn + eop + eijkl + eijmn + eijop + eklmn + eklop + emnop\r
+ eijklmn + eijklop + eijmnop + eklmnop + eijklmnop)/4.\r
(15)\r
Lemma 2. The conjugate quadruple 90◦rotation R, when mapped to sedenions\r
via e123456789ABCDEF can only be an automorphism if eij+ejk+emn+eop maps to zero\r
and eijklmnop maps to unity. It is assumed any minus signs of terms are absorbed\r
into the ordering of each pair of indices.\r
Proof. In Cl(7), the elements of G2 are members of the kernel under the map\r
(2) from Cl(7) to O. For example, the first element of G2 is 1\r
2\r
(e12 − e47), which\r
represents the rotations 1\r
2\r
(1 + e12)(1 − e47) and maps to unity,\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o1o2)(1 − o3o123) = 1\r
2\r
(1 + o12 − o12 − o12\r
2\r
) = 1.\r
The expansion of the quadruple rotation is provided in (15). The definition of\r
the calibration in Theorem 2 as terms of Φ\r
∗\r
representing O∗ or P\r
∗\r
4 means that\r
15

eij, ekl, emn, eop map to the same element after multiplying apart from an even\r
number of minus signs. Thus the sum of the mapped terms equals zero if there\r
are two minus signs and the compliment with respect to the 8-form of this are four\r
6-forms that will also map to zero. The six 4-forms will have four negative terms\r
and two positive, which mostly cancel after mapping leaving two negative terms.\r
Since each term maps to the same elements, then, for example −eijekl → 1. The\r
graded notation allows left-to-right expansion of Cayley-Dickson elements [2] so\r
the 8-form product will also map to unity, giving four unity elements that cancel\r
the divisor to give unity for the mapped quadruple rotation. The case that maps\r
to all positive signs will produce minus unity, for example, ( √\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o12))4 = −1,\r
which is excluded.\r
In Cl(3) and Cl(7), all invertibles map to automorphisms whereas the map,\r
e123456789ABCDEF, finds that the invariant terms that map to (+, +, +, +) do not\r
satisfy Lemma 2. Hence these are not automorphism candidates and in the tables\r
of invariants in the appendix the signs variations are adjusted so that such map\u0002pings are moved to Φ\r
A(4). Note that φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
∼= G2 already satisfies this condition\r
but Table 8 shows products of Φ\r
3\r
O involve Φ\r
C(4)\r
O\r
so these are excluded. Also, Φ\r
M\r
P\r
have the wrong parity to satisfy Lemma 2 hence would need to have the first term\r
negated but then they would not be invariants of Φ and are already excluded. This\r
limits the candidates for automorphisms of S to\r
Aut(S)\r
?∼= Φ\r
C(1+2)\r
O + ΦC(1+2)\r
P + ΦA(1+2+3)A\r
.\r
These candidates are again seen as three disconnected domains in the summary of\r
the Lie product tables (14) so further investigation is required.\r
The following parts of R are defined; α =\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + eijklmnop), β is the 2-form\r
plus 6-form parts of R and δ is the 4-form part. This separates R into α that\r
commutes with Φ and the remaining anticommuting parts. Also these consist of\r
linear combinations of q =\r
1\r
2\r
(eij + ekl + emn + eop) with the full expansion being\r
R = α + β + δ = (q\r
4 + 2q3 + 7q2 + 8q + 6)/6.\r
We find analogous properties to the 7-D case [3], α\r
2 = α, β2 = 4(α − 1), αβ =\r
βα = 0 and βΘ = Θ′β or Θβ = βΘ′, where Θ′ = RΘR−1. Hence, like Spin♯(7),\r
β provides the same action as R but here contains q and it’s complement with\r
respect to the imaginary eijklmnop. In 15-D the extra term, δ, has the following\r
properties, αδ = δα = δ, βδ = δβ = 0 and δ\r
2 = 3α − 2δ. Hence the conjugate\r
quad rotation of Θ is\r
Θ\r
′ = (α + β + δ)Θ(α − β + δ)/4\r
=\r
\r
(α\r
2 + βα + δα)Θ + (α + β + δ)Θ(δ − β)\r
\u0001\r
/4\r
=\r
\r
(α + δ)ΘαΘ(δ − β) + (β + δ)Θ(δ − β)\r
\u0001\r
/4\r
= (αΘ − βΘβ + δΘ + Θδ + Θ′βδ − δβΘ\r
′ + δΘδ)/4\r
= (αΘ − 4(α − 1)Θ′ + δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ)/4.\r
(16)\r
This reduces to αΘ′ = (αΘ + δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ)/4. Since α is a scalar plus an\r
8-form, the 3-form parts of this product isolates a definition of Θ′in terms of δ\r
and Θ. This expansion is not necessary here since we find for q ∈ Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
then\r
δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ = 3αΘ and (16) becomes an identity with αΘ = αΘ′\r
. This\r

statement that αΘ is a stabiliser for quad rotations Φ\r
C(1)\r
i\r

, of Θ′ was\r
also a condition for Spin♯(7) to generate G2. None of the other components or\r
signs of Φ satisfy this property so only Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
are automorphisms as 15-dimensional\r
representations of G2,\r
Aut(S) ∼= G2.\r
Graphical Interpretation\r
The Fano plane is the projective plane of the cube, Z\r
3\r
2\r
, with lines radiating out\r
from one vertex of the cube. The focal vertex is taken to be the scalar dimension\r
of octonions, or in our case Cl(7), so that the Fano plane vertices are labelled by\r
the basis elements in e1234567. The sedenions extend this to a projection of the\r
tesseract, Z\r
4\r
2\r
, the four-dimensional hypercube represented by placing a cube inside\r
a cube and connecting the closest corner vertices. In Cl(15), the inside cube is\r
labelled e89ABCDEF and the projection to the plane places the inner cube without\r
e8 as a false plane inside the projection of e1234567 as imagined by the plane view\r
in Figure 3. This is false because the upper circle, eAEC, and the tetrahedron\r
midpoint, eF, should be lowered to the middle of each face and the middle of the\r
tetrahedron, respectively, so should not be shown as a plane in Figure 3.\r

Figure 3: Tetrahedron projection schematic viewed from beneath\r
This tesseract projection represents all 15 octonion-like Fano planes in what\r
can be called the Fano volume. The ΦA octonion is shown as the bottom face\r
of the tetrahedrons in Figures 3 and 4. The ΦO octonions are represented as the\r
other faces and internal and circle arrows Fano planes that touch the bottom face\r
that all end in the e8 vertex. The circle on the bottom becomes the cone e246eACEe8\r
shown in Figure 5a. The ΦP P4 subalgebras are found according to (9) by replacing\r
e8 and the other three false Fano plane elements with the four other false Fano\r
plane elements. The three upper faces are lowered to the plane cutting the other\r
two face as e123e89AB → e123eCDEF. These are analogues for the upper faces of the\r
three inner lines on the bottom face seen in Figure 3. The three inner lines of ΦA\r
become circles on the upper faces, for example, e257e8ADF → e257e9CBE, which is the\r
cone e29Be7CEe5. Finally, the cone for the bottom circle transforms to e246eFe9BD,\r
17

which is the false plane in Figure 3 with the circle replaced by the bottom circle\r
or vice versa, shown in Figure 5b.\r

The octonion Fano planes have arrows that are not independent but lock to\u0002gether consistently to form the eight octonion representations and have an even\r
number of sign differences. For example, e246 and e28A are the negated middle term\r
for the first two 3-forms in Table 3, but both of these terms appear unsigned in the\r
e2468ACE row. By contrast, the power-associative subalgebras have odd numbers of\r
these anti-quaternion subalgebras.\r

5 Summary\r
Calibrations in Clifford algebra provide a new way to analyse the structure of\r
Cayley-Dickson algebras and this paper developed maps in order to understand\r
this relationship. The terms of the co-associative calibrations were called enabling\r
algebras, because they provide a construction of the automorphisms of Cayley\u0002Dickson algebras. They uncovered the mechanism for the action of automorphisms,\r
which is much more complicated in sedenions than in octonions, with enabling\r
18

algebras Spin♯\r
(7) and Spin♯(15) as subalgebras of Cl(7) and Cl(15), consisting\r
of seven commuting 4-forms and 15 commuting 8-forms, respectively, along with\r
scalars. Quaternions isomorphic to Spin♯(3) and the map (1) in Cl(3) generates\r
quaternions so they are self automorphisms in the algebra Cl(3). The even sharp\r
algebras may be considered as duals of Cayley-Dickson algebras since they have\r
the same 3-cycle structure of quaternions but are commuting and have squares\r
that are all unitary.\r
Cawagas discovered the algebra P4 [12] and found seven copies in sedenions\r
along with eight octonions [11]. This is only one of three power-associative alge\u0002bras that exist in Cayley-Dickson algebras with P12 and P14 embedded in doublings\r
of sedenions. Table 1 summarised how these algebras are part of a structure of\r
six power-associative, octonion-like algebras and explained the naming convention.\r
Using a graded notation allows the 15 octonion-like sub-algebras of sedenions to\r
be uniquely identified, up to representation and makes obvious the XOR product\r
structure. These 15 subalgebras were inverse mapped to find a new 8-form cali\u0002bration and Spin♯\r
(15) in Cl(15) and it is conjectured that this series in infinite.\r
The original analysis of Brown was partially applied to uncover automorphisms\r
related to G2 and analysis of the calibration limited this construction to just one\r
embedding of G2 in S, which agrees with Schafer’s analysis. The automorphisms\r
of Spin♯(15) reflected the same issues found for S.\r
Seven of the eight octonions embedded in sedenions that Cawagas found provide\r
the 15-dimensional G2 and these are easily identified from the calibration, Φ.\r
With the 7-dimensional octonion and the seven power-associative subalgebras of\r
sedenions a Fano volume tetrahedron was constructed containing 35 quaternions\r
and 15 Fano planes where each quaternion shares three Fano planes and each Fano\r
plane shares seven quaternions. It is considered possible that Fano hyper-volumes\r
exist for higher order Cayley-Dickson algebras.\r

Automorphisms of Sedenions\r
G. P. Wilmot\r
University of Adelaide, Australia\r
Abstract\r
This paper extends the seven-dimensional Fano plane to a 15-dimensional\r
Fano volume, which is related to sedenions. The Fano plane visualises the\r
octonions and their structure as seven quaternions and is derived from a\r
calibration in differential geometry. Clifford algebra allows the Spin and\r
Pin groups to fully analyse calibrations and a new calibration is created\r
that derives the Fano volume, which provides a visualisation of the complete\r
subalgebra structure of sedenions.\r
This new 15-dimensional calibration, along with the existing one contain\u0002ing 35 quaternions, enables an explicit derivation of the automorphisms of\r
sedenions matching Schafer’s result and hence addresses a discrepancy in the\r
literature. Also, Gresnigt has suggested extending Furey’s work on quark\r
and lepton families using octonions to three octonion subalgebras of sede\u0002nions. The Fano volume allows this process to avoid the power-associative\r
subalgebras of sedenions. It is conjectured that Fano hyper-volumes will\r
uncover the complete subalgebra structure of all Cayley-Dickson algebras.\r
Keywords. Clifford algebras, octonions, sedenions, Cayley-Dickson alge\u0002bras, calibrations, power-associative algebras, Fano volume."""

The series of Cayley-Dickson algebras, An, provides 2\r
n basis elements generated by\r
n generators at each level, n ≥ 0. The series starts with the reals, A0\r
∼= R, complex\r
numbers, A1\r
∼= C, quaternions, A2∼= H, octonions, A3∼= O, followed by the\r
sedenions, A4\r
∼= S. The series has increasingly complicated norms until sedenions\r
and all An, for n ≥ 4, which have zero divisors, hence they are power-associative\r
and can not be normed algebras. Because of this, until recently, they have been\r
avoided by physists as not being appropriate for reality. Mathematicians have\r
struggled with the analysis of these algebras with some support for the alternate\r
rule, which has been shown to be invalid [1, 2], and finding different embeddings\r
of Lie algebras in the automorphisms of An, for n ≥ 4.\r
The Lie algebras were formulated and classified by Killing and Cartan [4] and\r
the smallest exceptional Lie algebra, G2, was shown by Engel to be the auto\u0002morphisms of octonions, Aut(O) ∼= G2 [5]. Schafer [6] found that Aut(S)\r
?∼= G2\r
while, subsequently, Brown [7] found that Aut(S)\r
?∼= G2 × S3. This discrepency is\r
analysed extensively in this paper with the main result being a new calibration\r
that allows the enumeration of the automorphisms of sedenions. This analysis\r
arXiv:2512.07210v1 [math.RA] 8 Dec 2025

supports Schafer to find that Aut(S) ∼= G2 but also highlights the complications\r
for power-associative algebras.\r
A graded notation is used for both Clifford and Cayley-Dickson algebras, but\r
for different reasons. The Cl(n) algebras naturally represent the same geometric\r
objects as Grassmann’s exterior algebra and the grading follows that of differential\r
geometry. The An algebras are not directly related to geometry but the doubling\r
rule that defines the algebra [8] introduces a new generator at each level with the\r
binomial expansion of all generators providing the grading, as explained in the\r
following.\r
Definition. The basis of the Clifford algebra will be denoted as Cl(n) = heα : α ∈\r
{∅, 1, 2, . . . , n, 12, 13, . . . , 12 . . . n}i so that eα is isomorphic to Grassmann’s exterior\r
algebra and are called forms. The basis of the Cayley-Dickson algebra is denoted\r
as An = hoα : α ∈ {∅, 1, 2, . . . , n, 12, 13, . . . , 12 . . . n}i but this is not isomorphic to\r
the exterior algebra due to multiplication defined by the doubling rule [8]. Unity\r
is used in both algebras as e∅ = o∅ = 1 and e\r
2\r
i = 1 and o\r
2\r
i = −1 for i ∈ N\r
n\r
1\r
, using\r
Porteous’s notation [9] for a subset of natural numbers. The grading of these\r
algebras exposes the XOR multiplication operation and enforces the ordering of\r
the basis elements given by the above expansion for Cl(n) but using the doubling\r
rule for An [2].\r

Figure 1: Directed 2-simplex\r
The vector φ3 = e1+e2+e3 in three-dimensional Clifford algebra, Cl(3), can be\r
interpreted as a representation of the vertices of the 2-simplex shown in Figure 1.\r
The dual in Clifford algebra is found by multiplying any form by the negated\r
pseudoscalar, φ\r
∗\r
3 = −e123φ3 = −e12 + e13 − e23, which can represent the edges of\r
the directed simplex. The terms of the dual along with unity, 1, form a subalgebra\r
of Cl(3), the even subalgebra Cl+(3) isomorphic to the quaternions, and because\r
e123 is imaginary, including the terms of Φ3 and e123, we form a basis of Cl(3)\r
as complex quaternions, Cl(3) ≡ C ⊗ H. The Spin(n) group is defined as an\r
even product of unit length vectors in Cl(n) so is a subset of Cl+(n) [8] and is a\r
double covering of the special orthogonal group due to rotations being conjugate\r
operations. The Pin(n) group is defined as an odd number of unit vectors but to\r
be consistent with the general orthogonal group the even vectors are included so\r
Pin(n) is a subgroup of the invertible Clifford group, Cl∗(n).\r
Definition. A calibration [8], Φ, in differential geometry is a p-form on a subset,\r
U, of R\r
n\r
satisfying dΦ = 0 on U and has maximum one for any point in U on\r
the grassmannian of oriented p-dimensional subspaces of ΛR\r

calibration consists of associative 3-forms that correspond to associative algebras."""

associative calibration. These trivially satisfy the definition for calibrations and are\r
analysed here to demonstrate mappings from the quaternions in Clifford algebra\r
to the quaternions in Cayley-Dickson algebras, which will serve as an illustration\r
for higher dimensions.\r
Definition. The 3-form calibration in Cl(3) defines a map from Cl(3) to A2, the\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra with two generators, as\r
e123 : {(e1, e2, e3) → (o1, o2, o12)}, (1)\r
where o1\r
2 = o22 = o122 = −1, o1o2o12 = −1, o1o2 = o12, are associative and they\r
all anti-commute so A2 is isomorphic to the quaternions, H. The name of the\r
map defines the domain by associativity, e123 = e1e2e3, and parity as shown for the\r
directed face of Cl(3) in Figure 1. The dual Clifford algebra multiplies any element\r
by the negated pseudoscalar, which in Cl(3) is the following map that generates\r
the quaternions in Cl(3),\r
e123\r
∗\r
: {(e1, e2, e3) −→ (e23, e13, e12)}.\r
In general, an associative calibration admits a map from independent faces of a\r
simplex to quaternions in a Cayley-Dickson algebra, where independent means the\r
faces only touch in vertices.\r
A map that changes the order, e213 : {(e2, e1, e3) → (o2, o1, o12)}, keeps the\r
properties of equation (1) apart from having odd parity with o2o1o12 = +1, which\r
is isomorphic to an algebra sometimes called the anti-quaternions. Alternatively,\r
the map that changes the sign of one term, σ : {(e1, e2, −e3) → (o1, o2, −o12)}, also\r
satisfies −o1o2o12 = 1. So the parity e213 = −e123 = σ is an important property.\r
For example, e123 : {e12, e23} → {o1o2, o2o12} = {o12, o1} and, as a conjugate\r
rotation with R =\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o12)(1 + o1), is R(o1 + o2 + o12)R−1 = o1 + o2 + o12. This\r
is a demonstration of quaternions being their own automorphisms and even parity\r
rotations keeping the parity invariant.\r
Definition. The Spin elements that keep a calibration invariant in Cl(n) up to\r
parity will be called invariants. It will be found that only some invariants are au\u0002tomorphisms of subalgebras of the Spin group and of the corresponding mapped\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra. Negations of the invariants and the identity will be ex\u0002cluded.\r
Definition. A triad refers to a triple of Cayley-Dickson basis elements that are\r
distinct and pure, or non-scalar. The ordered associator for a triad is defined as\r
[a, b, c] = (ab)c−a(bc), for a < b < c in the ordering provided by the grading [2]. If\r
[a, b, c] = 0 then the triad is called associative. Quaternions and anti-quaternions\r
are associative.\r
Now consider the octonions, O, which have seven embedded quaternions and\r
28 non-associative products giving \r
7\r
3\r
\u0001\r
= 35 triads. Analogously to the map from\r
Cl(3) to H, we introduce a map from Cl(7) to O,\r
e1234567 : {(e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7) −→ (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, −o123)}. (2)\r

The quaternions in this map are described by the following calibration in Cl(7) [3,\r
8, 10], with the index 64 denoting the negation of the last three terms,\r
θ64 = e123 + e145 + e167 + e246 − e257 − e347 − e356.\r
This is illustrated by the Fano plane diagram, Figure 2, where the arrows corre\u0002spond to quaternions rather than anti-quaternions. Note that the negated term is\r
needed to satisfy this condition. The number of 90◦rotations in Cl(7) is \r
7\r
2\r
\u0001\r
= 21\r
and each any set of these applied to θ64 generates another calibration. Extending\r
equation (1) to 7-dimensional maps to embedded quaternions, eijk, for terms of\r
θ64, then this covers all rotations in Cl(7) so provides a bijective map from Spin(7)\r
to O.\r

It was shown in [3] that an invertible form can be created from this calibration\r
in Cl(7), as\r
(3e1234567 + θ64)\r
2 = −16. (3)\r
The dual Clifford algebra multiplies each term with the negated pseudoscalar in\r
Cl(7), e1234567, which, for the calibration θ64 defines the co-associative calibration,\r
θ\r
∗\r
64 = −e1234567θ64\r
= −e1247 − e1256 − e1346 + e1357 + e2345 + e2367 + e4567.\r

The 3-form with all positive terms, called the primary, is denoted\r
θ1 = e123 + e145 + e167 + e246 + e257 + e347 + e356.\r
Under the map e1234567 this does not map to octonions but to another algebra\r
which is power-associative. It still has a Fano plane representation but with ar\u0002rows that are inconsistent with the product rules of octonions. One might be\r
tempted to call this an anti-octonion algebra but there are six such algebras, Pk,\r
k ∈ {4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16}, where k denotes the number of non-associative triads.\r
Rotations and reflections of θ1 can be used to generate all Pk algebras [3]. Al\u0002though O has 28 non-associative triads it is not added as the case k = 28 in the\r
series because it is not power-associative. All of these seven algebras are called\r
octonion-like algebras herein. The question is how can these algebras have less than\r
28 non-associative triads when they consist of seven quaternion-like subalgebras.\r
Definition. The associator is extended in [2] to an unordered associator that\r
defines four non-associative types, shown below with a < b < c, where ⋆ denotes a\r
non-zero value."""

It is interesting to note that [2] found that only Pk for k ∈ {4, 12, 14} occur\r
as subalgebras in any Cayley-Dickson algebra. Table 1 shows that the associative\r
3-forms for these three algebras correspond to sign variations of θ1, the first of 30\r
representations of octonions presented in [3]. The Pk for k = {8, 10, 16} do not\r
appear in the first associative 3-form representation and maybe this is the reason\r
only P4, P12 and P14 occur in Cayley-Dickson algebras. Unfortunately, although\r
P12 and P14 appear in all 30 representations, it was found that P4 is missing from\r
the second group of six representations whereas P8 and P16 are missing from half\r
of the representations and P10 is missing from just two of the groups of six found\r
in the 30 associative 3-form representations."""

Introducing hexadecimal notation for the indices in 15 dimensions, the map\r
from Cl(15) to a basis of S is defined as\r
e123456789ABCDEF : (e1, e2, . . . , eF) −→ (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, o123, o4,\r
o14, o24, o124, o34, o134, o234, o1234).\r
(6)\r
This map is derived from Θ and unlike (2) has all positive signs to match S. For\r
example, e167 → o1o23 = −o123 so that e167 is negated in Θ but o123 is negated in\r
(2).\r
The inverse map applied to the triads of φO and φP can be used to define\r
7-forms by first expanding the triads in (5) to the seven terms of each loop. For\r
example, (o1, o2, o3) → (o1, o2, o12, o3, o13, o23, o123), which is inverse mapped to\r
e1234567. This represents the 7-dimensional octonion in the top left-hand quarter\r
of Table 2 and is denoted ΦA. The equivalent process applied to the remaining\r
6

terms gives,\r
ΦO = e12389AB + e14589CD + e16789EF\r
+ e2468ACE + e2578ADF + e3478BCF + e3568BDE\r
ΦP = e123CDEF + e145ABEF + e167ABCD + e2469BDF\r
+ e2579BCE + e3479ADE + e3569ACF.\r
(7)\r
Any three indices of ΦA or terms of ΦO mapped as basis elements by (6) that\r
are not quaternion generate octonions and any three mapped ΦP term indices,\r
not quaternion or X non-associative, generate the corresponding P4 representa\u0002tion. The 7-dimensional calibration has the property that ρ =\r
1\r
4\r
(3e1234567 + θ64) is\r
invertible, ρ\r
2 = −1 and in 15 dimensions we expect an analogous situation.\r
Theorem 1. The 7-form Φ = ΦA + ΦO + ΦP , is an invertible calibration with\r
invertible form ψ, ψ\r
2 = −1, where\r
ψ =\r
1\r
8\r
(7e123456789ABCDEF − Φ).\r
The calibration Φ generates sedenions under the mapping (6).\r
Proof. Note that ΦO consists of the terms of θ64 multiplied by e8 and the corre\u0002sponding term of a complimentary space calibration, with imaginary e9ABCDEF,\r
θ\r
′\r
64 = e9AB + e9CD + e9EF + eACE − eADF − eBCF − eBDE.\r
Multiplying by terms of ΦO acts on the terms of θ64 and θ\r
′\r
64 separately with\r
imaginaries e1234567 and e9ABCDEF so that multiplying the results by e123456789ABCDEF\r
returns the terms to ΦO. Hence ΦO is invertible with the same form as (3), apart\r
from the signs that are cancelled by the complimentary space term. The invertible\r
form is given by\r
(3e123456789ABCDEF − ΦO)\r
2 = −16. (8)\r
This invertible form, looking at each term, relates to ΦP as\r
e89ABCDEFΦO = ΦP , (9)\r
where e1234567e89ABCDEF = e123456789ABCDEF and e1234567 commutes with ΦO and ΦP ,\r
which means e89ABCDEF does too. We start by expanding ΦO in (8) as\r

the first, second and fourth indices of each term of Φ to the appropriate triad in\r
(5) that were shown in [2] to have X non-associativity for ΦO terms and A non\u0002associativity for ΦP terms thus generating all the subalgebras of sedenions.\r

Theorem 2 (Algebra stacking). Each Cayley-Dickson algebra of n generators\r
consists of 2\r
n − 1 embedded subalgebras with n − 1 generators that consist of Hn−1\r
embedded quaternions or anti-quaternions, where Hn = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)/6.\r
Proof. Each Cayley-Dickson algebra of n generators embeds Hn quaternions and\r
Tn = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n − 4)/168 octonion-like algebras [2]. Each octonion-like\r
algebra has seven associative or quaternion-like subalgebras, hence the number of\r
quaternions shared between each octonion-like algebra is\r
7Tn\r
Hn\r
=\r
6(2n − 4)\r
24\r
= 2n−2 − 1, for n > 2.\r
This is three for sedenions so that the quaternions in Θ match the quaternions\r
in Φ, 35 = 15 × 7/3. The quaternion-like subalgebras shared amongst octonion\u0002like subalgebras must also be shared amongst other larger subalgebras that cover\r
the algebra so that dividing the shared quaternion-like subalgebras in the algebra\r
of n generators with the quaternions for n − 1 generators gives the number of\r
embeddings of the largest subalgebra for n > 1,\r
Hn(2n−2 − 1)/Hn−1 = (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n−2 − 1)/(2n−1 − 1)(2n−1 − 2)\r
= (2n − 1)(2n − 2)(2n − 4)/(2n − 2)(2n − 4)\r
= 2n − 1.\r
This sequence starts with the result that C is embedded three times within\r
H, seven quaternions are in octonions and 15 octonion-like algebras in sedenions.\r
These embedded algebras can be found by first constructing the first quaternion\r
calibration in Cl(2n − 1), n > 2 by hand. It is easiest to extend the calibration\r
3-form in Cl(2n−1 − 1), n > 3 using the rule all pairs of indices can only appear\r

once. Then taking odd powers of this calibration until Nn-forms appear, where\r
Nn = 2n−1 − 1 and selecting the subset of these that only share quaternions\r
2\r
n−1 −1 times. These Nn-forms extend Nn−1-forms of the calibration of Cl(Nn). If\r
these calibrations, like the 8-form calibration in Cl(15), form a projection operator\r
then this can only happen if the terms of the dual form a closed algebra under\r
multiplication and the following definition is justified.\r
Definition. The terms of the dual of the Nn−1-form calibration in Cl(Nn) where\r
Nn = 2n−1, along with unity, 1, form a subalgebra of Spin(Nn) in Cl(Nn) denoted\r
Spin♯(Nn). The terms of the calibration and the imaginary pseudoscalar in Cl(Nn),\r
along with Spin♯\r
(Nn) form a subalgebra of Pin(Nn) denoted Pin♯(Nn). These\r
algebras are called sharp algebras. The Spin♯(Nn) consists of even forms and\r
Pin♯(Nn) consists of both even and odd forms.\r
Lemma 1 (Conjecture). The terms of Spin♯\r
(Nn) act on Pin♯(Nn) to swap Nn−1\r
pairs of odd-forms between themselves and Nn−1 pairs of even-forms between them\u0002selves. Hence, under conjugation, these are related to automorphisms of Spin♯\r
(Nn),\r
the Nn−1-form calibration and the original 3-form quaternion calibration of Hn\r
terms. The latter case implies the Spin♯\r
(Nn) terms are related to automorphisms\r
of the Cayley-Dickson algebra with n generators.\r
This lemma is left as a conjecture for n > 4 but is trivial for n = 1, 2, has been\r
validated in [3] for n = 3 (O) and the first part has been shown to be true for n = 4\r
(S) in Section 2. The remainer of the paper considers the relationship to sedenion\r
automorphisms. Note that Spin♯(1) ∼= R and the basis of Pin♯(1) is {1, e123} so\r
that Pin♯(1) ∼= C. Also Spin♯(3) ∼= H and Pin♯(3) ∼= Cl(3). It is interesting to\r
note that the Spin♯(Nn) algebras have the same cyclic structure of the equivalent\r
Cayley-Dickson algebra but are commutative and the basis elements square to\r
unity.\r
The octonion case uses the pure basis of Spin♯(7) with terms provided by θ64 in\r
(4) that was shown in [3] to be a subalgebra of Spin(7). It acts on Pin♯\r
(7) under\r
conjugation to swap three pairs of terms of θ\r
∗\r
64 and for the odd pair it swaps three\r
pairs of terms of θ64 amongst themselves. Since this act invariantly on θ64 it does\r
the same on O.\r
For sedenions, multiplying Φ by Φ\r
∗\r
i will swap seven pairs of 8-forms in Φ\r
∗ and\r
seven pairs of 7-forms in Φ, which is summarised in Table 4. From (7), ΦO terms\r
contain e8 whereas ΦA and ΦP terms do not. So multiplying by Φ\r

Brown [7] defines three transformations that define the automorphisms of a Cayley\u0002Dickson algebra with n generators, An, from those of An−1. The first transforma\u0002tion for a, b ∈ An−1 and σ ∈ Aut(An−1), is\r
σ\r
′\r
: a + bon → aσ + (bσ)on. (11)\r
The second transformation is the conjugate of on, which gives\r
Aut(An−1) × S2 ⊆ Aut(An),\r
where S2 is the symmetric group of order 2. The third equation is applied under\r
certain conditions and is interpreted as 60◦rotations of a and bon by Gresnigt [13].\r
This is claimed by both authors to mean, for n ∈ 4, 5, 6, that\r
Aut(An−1) × S3 = Aut(An).\r
But any single rotation from e1234567 to e9ABCDEF changes the e1234567 term of ΦO\r
to an inconsistent term so can’t be an automorphism.\r
Schafer‘[6] previously derived that the automorphisms for all Cayley-Dickson\r
algeras, An, t > 2, are the same. Hence\r
Aut(An) = G2, for n > 2.\r
To re-consider this discrepancy, the calibration approach of octonions is extended\r
to sedenions.\r
The 21 elements of G2 were provided in [3] in terms of pairs of Spin(7) ele\u0002ments called the effective algebra, Spin♯\r

invariants of θ64 and the three ordered pairs of the indices of any 4-form term of\r

64 swaps all three combinations of\r

With positive terms the invariants are called primary invariants. These provide 105\r
primary invariants and we now consider paired negation of terms, which preserve\r
the parity. Applying the map (6) shows that some invariants are automorphisms\r
and some need sign changes to become automorphisms of sedenions. Such sign\r
changes have been evaluated and are shown in the five tables, which provides 105\r
automorphisms of S. Negativing the last two terms also provides automorphisms\r

eµ1µ2 − eµ3µ4 − eµ5µ6 + eµ7µ8),\r
quadrupling the size of each table to generate 420 invariants of Φ.\r
Proof. The first map, (12), is identical to (11) which was proved by Brown [7]\r
for ΦO. This needs to be extended to cover e1234567 and ΦP . The second map.\r
(13), extends the first map to cover all groups of two of the eight indices of each\r
Spin♯(15) term (apart from the scalar). But the constraint is that once eµ1µi,\r
i ∈ N\r
8\r
1\r
is selected from eµ1µ2µ3µ4µ5µ6µ7µ8, then if i ≤ 4 the second term must also\r
select from indices µ3 and µ4 in N\r
4\r
2\r
, to keep Φ\r
∗\r
in (10) consistent, or if i > 4\r
then the second term must have µ3 ∈ N\r
4\r
2 and µ4 ∈ N\r
8\r
5\r
for the same reason. This\r
means that the first term, eµ1µifor i ∈ N\r
8\r
2\r
governs the solution and there are only\r
seven primary invariants for each term in Φ\r
∗\r
, giving a total of 105 before the sign\r
variations are applied.\r
Unlike Spin♯(7), the parity can cancel under the map (6) so all even permuta\u0002tions of the four 90◦\r
rotation 2-forms should be considered. Half of these permu\u0002tations will be negations of the other half so only four need be considered. Thus\r
there are 420 invariants of the Spin♯(15) and Pin♯(15) algebras. These sign varia\u0002tions can be juggled to provide closure under the Lie product. The first map, (12),\r
applied to Φ\r
∗\r
O was based on G2 so it is appropriate to duplicate the signs in Table 5\r

Definition. Theorem 2 finds three cyclic, (12), and four mixed, (13), invariants of\r
Φ. These are identified as Φ\r
C and ΦM, respectively, and together denoted ΦA. The\r
theorem also finds four sign variations as (+, +, +, +), (+, +, −, −), (+, −, +, −),\r
(+, −, −, +), which are denoted as Φ\r
A = ΦA(1)\r
, Φ\r
A(2)\r
, Φ\r
A(3)\r
, Φ\r
A(4), respectively.\r
Hence the total number of signed invariants are denoted as Φ\r
A(1+2+3+4) or parts\r
thereof, as appropriate.\r
All of the first sign variation invariants are provided in the Appendix. Like\r
Table 6, these are shown with signs juggled to provide closure under the Lie product\r
with themselves. The full 21 invariants of G2, Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
, are shown in Table 10 and the\r
21 invariants of Φ\r
(1)\r
P\r
are provided in Table 11. The second map, which in general\r
mixes the two G2 representations, has two lots of 28 invariants, those of Φ\r
M(1)\r

are\r
shown in Table 12 and those from Φ\r

in Table 13. The combined maps for ΦA,\r

The action of the invariants is a subset of the multiplication by Φ\r

i\r
shown\r
in Table 4. Instead of swapping seven 8-forms though, only four are swapped\r
due to the invariants being composed of four rotations, as shown in Table 7. The\r
Mixed(o4) row denotes the Φ\r
M\r
O invariant terms that map to o4. Since o4 is mapped\r
from e8 in (6) then such invariants do not rotate octonion components within ΦO.\r
The following Mixed(other) row in the table has terms that do not map to o4 so\r
acts on Φ differently.\r

anticommuting parts when applied to the calibration and the second part was\r
found to define G2 because they had the same action as that of the double rotation.\r
Since the rotations kept the calibration invariant then the anticommuting terms\r
were automorphisms of Pin♯(7) and are found here to map under e1234567 to the\r
kernel of octonions and hence are automorphisms of octonions.\r
Here we state the equivalent results for Spin♯(15) by considering quadruple 90◦\r

Lemma 2. The conjugate quadruple 90◦rotation R, when mapped to sedenions\r
via e123456789ABCDEF can only be an automorphism if eij+ejk+emn+eop maps to zero\r
and eijklmnop maps to unity. It is assumed any minus signs of terms are absorbed\r
into the ordering of each pair of indices.\r
Proof. In Cl(7), the elements of G2 are members of the kernel under the map\r
(2) from Cl(7) to O. For example, the first element of G2 is 1\r
2\r
(e12 − e47), which\r
represents the rotations 1\r
2\r
(1 + e12)(1 − e47) and maps to unity,\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o1o2)(1 − o3o123) = 1\r
2\r
(1 + o12 − o12 − o12\r
2\r
) = 1.\r
The expansion of the quadruple rotation is provided in (15). The definition of\r
the calibration in Theorem 2 as terms of Φ\r
∗\r
representing O∗ or P\r
∗\r
4 means that\r
15

eij, ekl, emn, eop map to the same element after multiplying apart from an even\r
number of minus signs. Thus the sum of the mapped terms equals zero if there\r
are two minus signs and the compliment with respect to the 8-form of this are four\r
6-forms that will also map to zero. The six 4-forms will have four negative terms\r
and two positive, which mostly cancel after mapping leaving two negative terms.\r
Since each term maps to the same elements, then, for example −eijekl → 1. The\r
graded notation allows left-to-right expansion of Cayley-Dickson elements [2] so\r
the 8-form product will also map to unity, giving four unity elements that cancel\r
the divisor to give unity for the mapped quadruple rotation. The case that maps\r
to all positive signs will produce minus unity, for example, ( √\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + o12))4 = −1,\r
which is excluded.\r
In Cl(3) and Cl(7), all invertibles map to automorphisms whereas the map,\r
e123456789ABCDEF, finds that the invariant terms that map to (+, +, +, +) do not\r
satisfy Lemma 2. Hence these are not automorphism candidates and in the tables\r
of invariants in the appendix the signs variations are adjusted so that such map\u0002pings are moved to Φ\r
A(4). Note that φ\r

but Table 8 shows products of Φ"""

so these are excluded. Also, Φ\r
M\r
P\r
have the wrong parity to satisfy Lemma 2 hence would need to have the first term\r
negated but then they would not be invariants of Φ and are already excluded. This\r
limits the candidates for automorphisms of S to\r
Aut(S)\r

O + ΦC(1+2)\r
P + ΦA(1+2+3)A\r
.\r
These candidates are again seen as three disconnected domains in the summary of\r
the Lie product tables (14) so further investigation is required.\r
The following parts of R are defined; α =\r
1\r
2\r
(1 + eijklmnop), β is the 2-form\r
plus 6-form parts of R and δ is the 4-form part. This separates R into α that\r
commutes with Φ and the remaining anticommuting parts. Also these consist of\r
linear combinations of q =\r
1\r
2\r
(eij + ekl + emn + eop) with the full expansion being\r
R = α + β + δ = (q\r
4 + 2q3 + 7q2 + 8q + 6)/6.\r
We find analogous properties to the 7-D case [3], α\r
2 = α, β2 = 4(α − 1), αβ =\r
βα = 0 and βΘ = Θ′β or Θβ = βΘ′, where Θ′ = RΘR−1. Hence, like Spin♯(7),\r
β provides the same action as R but here contains q and it’s complement with\r
respect to the imaginary eijklmnop. In 15-D the extra term, δ, has the following\r
properties, αδ = δα = δ, βδ = δβ = 0 and δ\r
2 = 3α − 2δ. Hence the conjugate\r
quad rotation of Θ is\r
Θ\r
′ = (α + β + δ)Θ(α − β + δ)/4\r

′ + δΘδ)/4\r
= (αΘ − 4(α − 1)Θ′ + δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ)/4.\r
(16)\r
This reduces to αΘ′ = (αΘ + δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ)/4. Since α is a scalar plus an\r
8-form, the 3-form parts of this product isolates a definition of Θ′in terms of δ\r
and Θ. This expansion is not necessary here since we find for q ∈ Φ\r
C(1)\r
O\r
then\r
δΘ + Θδ + δΘδ = 3αΘ and (16) becomes an identity with αΘ = αΘ′\r

Graphical Interpretation\r
The Fano plane is the projective plane of the cube, Z\r
3\r
2\r
, with lines radiating out\r
from one vertex of the cube. The focal vertex is taken to be the scalar dimension\r
of octonions, or in our case Cl(7), so that the Fano plane vertices are labelled by\r
the basis elements in e1234567. The sedenions extend this to a projection of the\r
tesseract, Z\r
4\r
2\r
, the four-dimensional hypercube represented by placing a cube inside\r
a cube and connecting the closest corner vertices. In Cl(15), the inside cube is\r
labelled e89ABCDEF and the projection to the plane places the inner cube without\r
e8 as a false plane inside the projection of e1234567 as imagined by the plane view\r
in Figure 3. This is false because the upper circle, eAEC, and the tetrahedron\r
midpoint, eF, should be lowered to the middle of each face and the middle of the\r
tetrahedron, respectively, so should not be shown as a plane in Figure 3.\r

Figure 3: Tetrahedron projection schematic viewed from beneath\r
This tesseract projection represents all 15 octonion-like Fano planes in what\r
can be called the Fano volume. The ΦA octonion is shown as the bottom face\r
of the tetrahedrons in Figures 3 and 4. The ΦO octonions are represented as the\r
other faces and internal and circle arrows Fano planes that touch the bottom face\r
that all end in the e8 vertex. The circle on the bottom becomes the cone e246eACEe8\r
shown in Figure 5a. The ΦP P4 subalgebras are found according to (9) by replacing\r
e8 and the other three false Fano plane elements with the four other false Fano\r
plane elements. The three upper faces are lowered to the plane cutting the other\r
two face as e123e89AB → e123eCDEF. These are analogues for the upper faces of the\r
three inner lines on the bottom face seen in Figure 3. The three inner lines of ΦA\r
become circles on the upper faces, for example, e257e8ADF → e257e9CBE, which is the\r
cone e29Be7CEe5. Finally, the cone for the bottom circle transforms to e246eFe9BD,\r

Calibrations in Clifford algebra provide a new way to analyse the structure of\r
Cayley-Dickson algebras and this paper developed maps in order to understand\r
this relationship. The terms of the co-associative calibrations were called enabling\r
algebras, because they provide a construction of the automorphisms of Cayley\u0002Dickson algebras. They uncovered the mechanism for the action of automorphisms,\r
which is much more complicated in sedenions than in octonions, with enabling\r
18

algebras Spin♯\r
(7) and Spin♯(15) as subalgebras of Cl(7) and Cl(15), consisting\r
of seven commuting 4-forms and 15 commuting 8-forms, respectively, along with\r
scalars. Quaternions isomorphic to Spin♯(3) and the map (1) in Cl(3) generates\r
quaternions so they are self automorphisms in the algebra Cl(3). The even sharp\r
algebras may be considered as duals of Cayley-Dickson algebras since they have\r
the same 3-cycle structure of quaternions but are commuting and have squares\r
that are all unitary.\r
Cawagas discovered the algebra P4 [12] and found seven copies in sedenions\r
along with eight octonions [11]. This is only one of three power-associative alge\u0002bras that exist in Cayley-Dickson algebras with P12 and P14 embedded in doublings\r
of sedenions. Table 1 summarised how these algebras are part of a structure of\r
six power-associative, octonion-like algebras and explained the naming convention.\r
Using a graded notation allows the 15 octonion-like sub-algebras of sedenions to\r
be uniquely identified, up to representation and makes obvious the XOR product\r
structure. These 15 subalgebras were inverse mapped to find a new 8-form cali\u0002bration and Spin♯\r
(15) in Cl(15) and it is conjectured that this series in infinite.\r
The original analysis of Brown was partially applied to uncover automorphisms\r
related to G2 and analysis of the calibration limited this construction to just one\r
embedding of G2 in S, which agrees with Schafer’s analysis. The automorphisms\r
of Spin♯(15) reflected the same issues found for S.\r
Seven of the eight octonions embedded in sedenions that Cawagas found provide\r
the 15-dimensional G2 and these are easily identified from the calibration, Φ.\r
With the 7-dimensional octonion and the seven power-associative subalgebras of\r
sedenions a Fano volume tetrahedron was constructed containing 35 quaternions\r
and 15 Fano planes where each quaternion shares three Fano planes and each Fano\r
plane shares seven quaternions. It is considered possible that Fano hyper-volumes\r
exist for higher order Cayley-Dickson algebras.\r
