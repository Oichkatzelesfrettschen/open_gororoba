g2,2 may be contracted with the reduced space objects (e.g. x, b zb or the reduced metric),
which will trivially give zero. Alternatively, the indices of g2,2 may be contracted with the
indices of some other g2,2 floating around, such as if there are more than one S1 operators
in (4.6). However, the latter contraction gives the supertrace (g2,2)
