Warp drives are very interesting configurations in general relativity: At least theoretically, they\r
provide a way to travel at superluminal speeds, albeit at the cost of requiring exotic matter to exist\r
as solutions of Einstein’s equations. However, even if one succeeded in providing the necessary exotic\r
matter to build them, it would still be necessary to check whether they would survive to the switching\r
on of quantum effects. Semiclassical corrections to warp-drive geometries have been analyzed only\r
for eternal warp-drive bubbles traveling at fixed superluminal speeds. Here, we investigate the more\r
realistic case in which a superluminal warp drive is created out of an initially flat spacetime. First of\r
all we analyze the causal structure of eternal and dynamical warp-drive spacetimes. Then we pass to\r
the analysis of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a quantum field in these geometries.\r
While the behavior of the RSET in these geometries has close similarities to that in the geometries\r
associated with gravitational collapse, it shows dramatic differences too. On one side, an observer\r
located at the center of a superluminal warp-drive bubble would generically experience a thermal\r
flux of Hawking particles. On the other side, such Hawking flux will be generically extremely high\r
if the exotic matter supporting the warp drive has its origin in a quantum field satisfying some form\r
of quantum inequalities. Most of all, we find that the RSET will exponentially grow in time close\r
to, and on, the front wall of the superluminal bubble. Consequently, one is led to conclude that the\r
warp-drive geometries are unstable against semiclassical backreaction.\r

I. INTRODUCTION\r
Since Alcubierre introduced them [1], warp drives have\r
been certainly one of the most studied spacetime geome\u0002tries among those requiring exotic matter for its existence\r
(see [2] for a recent review about “exotic spacetimes”).\r
They were immediately recognized as interesting configu\u0002rations for two main reasons. First, they provide, at least\r
theoretically, a way to travel at superluminal speeds: A\r
warp drive can be described as a spheroidal bubble sep\u0002arating an almost flat internal region from an external\r
asymptotically flat spacetime with respect to which the\r
bubble moves at an arbitrary speed. The idea is that\r
although on top of a spacetime nothing can move with\r
speeds greater than that of light, spacetime itself has no\r
a priori restriction on the speed with which it can be\r
stretched. Second, they provide an exciting ground for\r
testing our comprehension of general relativity (GR) and\r
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (for instance\r
when investigating warp-drive implications for causality\r
[3]).\r
In its original form [1] the warp-drive geometries are\r

the center of the bubble andv\r
0 the warp-drive velocity.\r
Here and thereafterv=v\r
0\r
f(r) withf a suitable smooth\r
function satisfyingf(0) = 1 andf(r)→ 0 forr → ∞.\r
After the warp-drive spacetimes were proposed, the\r
most investigated aspect of them has been the amount\r
of exotic matter (i.e. energy-conditions-violating matter)\r
that would be required to support them.\r
1\r
It was soon\r
realized that this was not only related to the size of the\r
warp-drive bubble but also determined by the thickness\r
of the bubble walls [6]. It was found that, if the ex\u0002oticity was provided by the quantum nature of a field,\r
satisfying therefore the so-called quantum inequalities\r
(QI),\r
2\r
then the violations of the energy conditions would\r
have to be confined to Planck-size regions, making the\r
bubble-wall thickness ∆ to be, accordingly, of Planck\r
size [∆≤ 10\r
2\r
(v\r
0/c\r
)L\r
P , where\r
L\r
P is the Planck length].\r
However, it can be shown that very thin walls require\r
very large amounts of exotic matter: e.g., in order to\r
support a warp-drive bubble with a size of about 100 m\r
and propagating atv\r
0\r
≈c, one would need a total nega\u0002tive energy |E| ≫ 1011M⊙.3 Perspectives for warp-drive 1 While initially it was supposed that exotic matter was needed\r
only for superluminal warp drives (v\r
0 > c), it was later rec\u0002ognized [4, 5] that energy-conditions-violating matter is needed\r
also for subluminal speeds. This points out that the need of\r
exotic matter is peculiar of the warp-drive geometry itself, not\r
appearing only in the superluminal regime.\r
2 See [7] for a review about quantum inequalities applied to some\r
exotic spacetimes.\r
3\r
If one could somehow avoid the QI, then it would be possible to

2\r
engineering can be improved by resorting to a modified\r
warp-drive configuration with a reduced surface area but\r
the same bubble volume [8]. The total amount of neg\u0002ative energy required to support these warp drives be\u0002comes quite small (for example, |E−| ≈ 0.3M⊙ for a 100\r
m-radius bubble, although one has to add as well some\r
positive energy outside the bubble E+ ≈ 2.5M⊙), bring\u0002ing the warp drive closer to a realistic solution albeit still\r
far from foreseeable realizations.\r
Regarding the feasibility of warp-drive configurations,\r
a parallel line of research has focused on the study of their\r
robustness against the introduction of quantum correc\u0002tions to GR. In particular, in [9] it was studied what\r
would be the effect of having semiclassical corrections in\r
the case of an eternal superluminal warp drive. There,\r
it was noticed that to an observer within the warp-drive\r
bubble, the backward and forward walls (along the di\u0002rection of motion) look, respectively, like the horizon of\r
a black hole and of a white hole. By imposing over the\r
spacetime a quantum state which is vacuum at the null\r
infinities (i.e., what one may call the analog of the Boul\u0002ware state for an eternal black hole) it was found that\r
the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) diverges\r
at the horizons.4Independently of the availability of ex\u0002otic matter to build the warp drive in the first place, the\r
existence of a divergence of the RSET at the horizons\r
would be telling us that it is not possible to create a\r
warp-drive geometry within the context of semiclassical\r
GR: Semiclassical effects would destroy any superlumi\u0002nal warp drive. However, in a more realistic situation,\r
a warp drive would have to be created at a very low ve\u0002locity in a given reference frame and then accelerated\r
to superluminal speeds. One may then expect that the\r
quantum state globally defined on such dynamical geom\u0002etry would be automatically selected by the dynamics\r
once suitable boundary conditions are provided (e.g., at\r
early times). This is indeed the case for a gravitational\r
collapse where it can be shown that, whenever a trap\u0002ping horizon forms, the globally defined quantum state\r
that is vacuum on I − has to be thermal at I + (at the\r
Hawking temperature) and regular at the horizon. In\r
other words, the dynamics of the collapse avoids select\u0002ing a Boulware-like state, with its associated divergence\r
at the horizon, ending up instead selecting the analo\u0002gous for collapsing configurations of the Unruh vacuum\r
state defined on eternal black holes, which leads to a per\u0002fectly regular RSET. Is the dynamics of the creation of\r
a warp drive, with its associated selection of the global\r
vacuum state, able to avoid the presence of divergences in\r
the RSET? Indeed, in [9] it was already noticed that an\r
Unruh-like state rather than a Boulware-like state should\r
be expected to describe the quantum state characterizing\r
built warp drives with much larger wall thickness. For example,\r
for ∆ ≃ 1 m, one would only need |E| & 1/4 M⊙.\r
4 Throughout this paper we shall work in the Heisenberg represen\u0002tation so that only operators, not the states, evolve in time.\r
a superluminal warp-drive creation.\r
In this paper we want to settle this issue by explicitly\r
considering the case of a warp drive which is created with\r
zero velocity at early times and then accelerated up to\r
some superluminal speed in a finite amount of time. This\r
can be viewed as the warp-drive analog of a semiclassical\r
black hole collapse [10]. By restricting attention to warp\r
drives in 1 + 1 dimensions (since this is the only case for\r
which one can carry out a complete analytic treatment),\r
we have calculated the RSET in the warp-drive bubble.\r
As we were expecting, we find that in the center of the\r
bubble there is a thermal flux of particles at the Hawk\u0002ing temperature corresponding to the surface gravity of\r
the black horizon. However, the surface gravity can be\r
shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the\r
bubble walls which, as said, has to be of the order of the\r
Planck length if some form of QI holds. Hence, one has\r
to conclude that an internal observer would soon find it\u0002self in the uncomfortable condition of being swamped by\r
a thermal flux at the Planck temperature. Even worse,\r
we do show that the RSET does increase exponentially\r
with time on the white horizon and close to it (while\r
it is regular and small on the black one). This clearly\r
implies that warp drives would become rapidly unstable\r
once superluminal speeds are reached.\r
The plan of the paper is the following. In Sec. II we\r
study the causal structure of both an eternal and a dy\u0002namic warp drive. In Sec. III we discuss the propagation\r
of light rays in a dynamical warp-drive geometry in close\r
analogy with the standard treatment for black holes.5\r
Finally, in Sec. IV we calculate the full RSET using the\r
technique adopted in [10] for black hole formation and\r
look for its divergences. A summary of our results is\r
given in Sec. V.\r
II. CAUSAL STRUCTURE OF A\r
SUPERLUMINAL WARP DRIVE\r
We investigate the causal structure of a warp drive,\r
following the method presented in [12], for spacetimes\r
whose metrics can be written in Painlev´e-Gullstrand co\u0002ordinates. We begin from an eternal warp drive, moving\r
at constant velocity, and then we study a dynamic situ\u0002ation in which a warp-drive bubble is accelerated.\r
A. Eternal superluminal warp drive\r
In 1+1 dimensions Alcubierre’s metric Eq. (1) reduces\r
to\r
ds2 = −c\r
2\r
dt2 + [dx − v(r)dt]\r
2\r
. (2)\r
5 A similar result was found by Gonz´alez-D´ıaz [11].

3\r
Here r is defined as the signed distance from the center\r
of the bubble, r ≡ x−v0t. Again we define v(r) = v0f(r)\r
but f is now taken to be defined also for negative values of\r
r. Its boundary conditions will be f(0) = 1 and f(r) → 0\r
for r → ±∞. For illustrative purposes, let us choose the\r
following simple bell-shaped function:\r
f(r) = 1\r
cosh (r/a)\r
(3)\r
and v0 > c, that is, our warp drive is superluminal. We\r
want to stress that all the results of this paper do not\r
depends on the particular choice of the function f. They\r
are still valid providing that it satisfies the above condi\u0002tions. We have chosen a particular form for it just for\r
simplicity. Now, by using (t, r) coordinates the metric\r
Eq. (2) reads\r
ds2 = −c\r
2\r
dt2 + [dr − v¯(r)dt]\r
2\r
, v¯(r) = v(r) − v0 .\r
(4)\r
Note that ¯v < 0 because the warp drive is right going\r
(v > 0) but v(r) ≤ v0.\r
By definition, at any time the center of the bubble is\r
located at r = 0. The causal structure of this metric can\r
be analyzed following [12]. Let us define the warp-drive\r
Mach number α ≡ v0/c. The shift velocity becomes\r
v¯(r) = αc \u0014\r

cosh (r/a)\r

Because of our simple profile choice, the two horizons are\r
symmetrically located with respect to r = 0. In more\r
general situations r1 and r2 will be completely arbitrary\r
satisfying only r1 < r2.\r
Right- and left-going null coordinates u and v can be\r
defined as\r
du ≡ dt −\r

dw ≡ dt +\r

. (8)\r
We note that the spacetime is divided into three distinct\r
regions: I (r < r1), II (r1 < r < r2), and III (r > r2).\r
There are no u rays connecting these regions, while w rays\r
cross all the regions; when r approaches the horizons, u\r
diverges logarithmically. Integrating these equations we\r

where β is defined in Eq. (6) and γ ≡ α/ (α + 1) < 1. In\r
Fig. 1 we plot the lines of constant u and w. The horizon\r
at r = r1 corresponds to uI → +∞ and to uII → +∞,\r
while the horizon at r = r2 corresponds to uII → −∞\r
and to uIII → −∞.\r
We define a signed surface gravity on our two horizons:\r

So doing, the surface gravity associated with the first\r
horizon is positive κ1 = κ > 0, while the one associated\r
with the second horizon is negative κ2 = −κ < 0.6 As we\r

In the definition of surface gravity, more correctly one should

noticed for the positions of r1 and r2, in a general situa\u0002tion in which f is not symmetric, the two surface gravities\r
may have different absolute values. However, the one as\u0002sociated with the first horizon (respectively, second hori\u0002zon) will be always positive (respectively, negative). We\r
will soon show that these two horizons represent a black\r
and a white horizon, respectively. Here on, we will con\u0002sider the two surface gravities to have the same absolute\r
value. Retaining different absolute values will not lead\r
to more general results, but will just make the notation\r
heavier.\r
As in Sec. 6 of [12], one can find some transformation\r
Ui = Ui(ui) that close to the horizons behaves as\r
UI(uI → +∞) ≃ UI + AIe\r
−κuI\r
, (14)\r
UII(uII → ±∞) ≃ UII± ∓ AII±e\r
∓κuII\r
, (15)\r
UIII(uIII → −∞) ≃ UIII − AIIIe\r
κuIII\r
, (16)\r
where UI, UII+, UII−, and UIII are arbitrary constants\r
and AI, AII+, AII−, and AIII are positive constants. It is\r
possible to choose these transformations such that they\r
match on the horizons, obtaining a global U varying reg\u0002ularly from +∞ to −∞ as r varies from −∞ to +∞. This\r
matching will become natural when dealing with dynam\u0002ical configurations in which the warp drive is created by\r
accelerating the bubble from an initial zero velocity. In\r
order to do that we can choose UI = UII+ ≡ UBH and\r
UII− = UIII ≡ UWH < UBH. In this way the three trans\u0002formation have the following domains:\r
uI ∈ (−∞, +∞) ⇒ UI ∈ (+∞, UBH) , (17)\r
uII ∈ (+∞, −∞) ⇒ UII ∈ (UBH, UWH) , (18)\r
uIII ∈ (−∞, +∞) ⇒ UIII ∈ (UWH, −∞) . (19)\r
For instance, specific transformations having the re\u0002quired properties are the following:\r
UI =\r
1\r
2\r
+ e\r
−κuI\r
, (20)\r
UII =\r
1\r
2\r
tanh \u0010κuII\r
2\r
\u0011\r
, (21)\r
UIII = −\r
1\r
2\r
− e\r
κuIII\r
. (22)\r
Now we can bring the right and left infinities to a finite\r
distance by using a compactifying transformation like\r
UI ≡ arctan(UI) , (23)\r
UIII ≡ arctan(UIII) , (24)\r
W ≡ arctan(w) . (25)\r
The Penrose diagram for this spacetime is plotted in\r
Fig. 2. Notice that the diagram does not correspond to a\r
multiply the velocity derivative by c to get an acceleration. How\u0002ever we use this slightly modified definition to avoid the appear\u0002ance of too many constant c factors in our formulas.\r

the total spacetime. The dashed lines signal the locations\r
at which the geometry can be extended. The two exter\u0002nal regions r > r2 and r < r1 appear to an observer living\r
inside the bubble as an eternal white hole and an eternal\r
black hole, respectively. For this reason, we call H +\r
1\r
and\r
H −\r
2\r
, respectively, the black horizon and the white hori\u0002zon of the warp drive. Notice however that for the inner\r
observers in an eternal configuration, at r1 there is also\r
a white horizon [H −\r
C\r
(t = −∞, r = r1) in the diagram]\r
and at r2 a black horizon [H +\r
C\r
(t = +∞, r = r2) in the\r
diagram]. The geometry can be extended through these\r
two null lines. We do not picture the extended regions\r
as there are ambiguities in the prescription of the matter\r
distribution in those other “universes.”7\r
B. Dynamic superluminal warpdrive\r
What happens to the causal structure when we con\u0002sider the creation of a superluminal warp drive starting\r
from initially flat spacetime? For concreteness, we study\r
a simple case in which we reach the final velocity v = v0\r
at a finite time which we take to be t = 0. We modify\r
7\r
In the analysis of the maximal extention of the Schwarzschild or\r
Kerr spacetimes this problem is not present as one considers only\r
vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations.

5\r
the metric Eq. (2) introducing a switching factor δ(t):\r
ds2 = −c\r
2\r
dt2 + [dx − v(r, t)dt]\r
2\r
, (26)\r
where\r
v(r, t) = v0δ(t)f(r) , (27)\r
with f(r) defined in Eq. (3) and\r
δ(t) ≡\r
(\r
e\r
t/τ if t < 0 ,\r
1 if t ≥ 0 .\r
(28)\r
Again we can change coordinates, keeping the center of\r
the bubble at rest (r = 0). This can be obtained by\r
defining\r
dr ≡ dx − v0δ(t)dt . (29)\r
This is an exact differential form and can be integrated\r
to get\r
r =\r

x − v0τ\r
h\r
e\r
t/τ − 1\r
i\r
if t < 0 ,\r
x − v0t if t ≥ 0 .\r
(30)\r
Again, the metric becomes\r
ds2 = −c\r
2\r
dt2 + [dr − vˆ(r, t)dt]\r
2\r
,\r
vˆ(r, t) = v0δ(t) [f(r) − 1]\r
(31)\r
and the apparent horizons associated with the t slicing\r
are found by setting ˆv = −c. In this case a solution does\r
not exist for any value of t, so that the apparent hori\u0002zons are created at infinity at some finite tH. We show\r
this below. Let us write the equation for the apparent\r
horizons in the following form:\r
f(r) = 1 −\r
c\r
v0δ(t)\r
. (32)\r
The function f takes all the values between 0 and 1. In\r
particular, f(r) → 0 for r → ±∞ and f(0) = 1. Besides,\r
the right-hand side of Eq. (32) is a monotonic function\r
of t, such that, for t → −∞, 1 − c/ (v0δ(t)) → −∞\r
and reaches the value 1 − c/v0 > 0 for t ≥ 0. As a\r
consequence, there exists a time tH < 0 so that for t > tH\r
there are always two solutions of Eq. (32), corresponding\r
to a black and a white horizon. These horizons are born\r
at t = tH at spatial infinity and at t = 0 they settle at\r
two fixed positions r1 and r2.\r
Keeping these points in mind, we are able to build the\r
Penrose diagram for the dynamic warp drive (Fig. 3).\r
At early times the metric is approximately Minkowskian,\r
because δ(t) → 0 for t → −∞. Therefore, the causal\r
structure is initially Minkowskian. Then, it progressively\r
changes till t = 0. At this time one has built a stationary\r
warp drive, just as in the previous section. After this\r
time, the Penrose diagram looks exactly equal to that in\r
Fig. 2. The final Penrose diagram is just obtained by\r

gluing together the two behaviors. Again, we are not\r
drawing an analytically extended diagram but only the\r
relevant patch for the analysis that follow in this paper.\r
Given that a timelike observer can reach H +\r
C\r
and H +\r
R\r
in a finite proper time, the geometry can be extended in\r
the future, beyond these lines. This is actually a sub\u0002tle point. In fact, H +\r
C\r
and H +\r
R (which are linked to\r
the formation of a white horizon) are on the boundary\r
of the Cauchy development of I −. In this sense, they\r
are Cauchy horizons given that initial data are assigned\r
only on I −. Hence, as noticed in Sec. II A, an eventual\r
extension would not be unique. In any case such an ex\u0002tension will not be relevant for what will follow, given\r
that we shall limit ourselves to investigating the asymp\u0002totic behavior of the RSET associated with the onset of\r
the superluminal warp drive.\r
Let us highlight here that the dynamic way we have\r
used here to create the warp drive is not the only possible\r
way. In Appendix A, we will also use a different interpo\u0002lation between Minkowski and the warp drive in which\r
the horizons appear also at finite time but at finite r\r
positions (similar to what happens when a homogeneous\r
star collapses to form a black hole).\r
III. LIGHT-RAY PROPAGATION\r
The just discussed causal structure of the dynamical\r
warp drive is naturally leading to the expectation that\r
some sort of Hawking radiation will be produced in a su-

6\r
perluminal warp drive (as well as some transient particle\r
emission). It is well known (see, for example, [13]) that\r
all the information about particle production is encoded\r
in the way in which light rays propagate in a spacetime.\r
That is, it is enough to know how light rays are bended\r
in order to analyze the phenomenon of particle creation.\r
In the dynamical warp drive there is a single past null\r
coordinate but three different future null coordinates as\u0002sociated with the final regions I, II and III, as described\r
before. From here on, we will be dealing exclusively with\r
the connection between the past null coordinate U at I\r
−\r
L\r
and the future null coordinate uII at H +\r
C\r
in the interior\r
of the bubble. Therefore, we will use u to denote uII\r
whenever this does not lead to confusion. As discussed\r
in [14] the relation U = p(u) encodes all the relevant\r
information about particle production.\r
We want to study the features due to the two main\r
properties of a dynamical warp-drive geometry, i.e., the\r
spacetime is Minkowskian at early times and it is a warp\r
drive at late times. In particular, we are not interested\r
in the transient features depending on how the transi\u0002tion between these two regimes is performed. Namely, we\r
need only the behavior close to the horizons and at late\r
times inside the whole bubble. It is clear from Fig. 3 that,\r
if one stays at constant r inside the bubble and moves\r
forward in time one crosses u rays which pass closer and\r
closer to the black horizon. Therefore, once we have de\u0002termined the behavior of p(u) close to the horizons,8 we\r
automatically also have the required information at late\r
times in the whole bubble.\r
In general, the relation U = p(u) is obtained by inte\u0002grating the differential equation for the propagation of\r
right-going light rays\r
dr\r
dt = c + ˆv(r, t) . (33)\r
Note that while in the previous section we considered a\r
specific form of ˆv(r, t) [Eq. (31)] in order to discuss the\r
causal structure of the associated spacetime, here (and in\r
what will follow) the discussion will hold for any ˆv(r, t)\r
that satisfies the requirements ˆv(r, t) → 0, for t → −∞\r
(sufficiently rapid for the spacetime to be asymptotically\r
flat), and ˆv(r, t) = ¯v after some finite time and within\r
the warp-drive bubble. Given the assumption that the\r
spacetime settles down to a stationary warp-drive con\u0002figuration, at late times the velocity profile will depend\r
only on the r coordinate. We can write, as in the sta\u0002tionary case Eq. (7)\r
du = dt −\r
dr\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
. (34)\r
To find the required asymptotic relation one has to in\u0002tegrate this equation in the limit r → r1,2. There, the\r
8 Appendix A gives a specific example for which this relation can\r
be computed exactly in the whole spacetime.\r
velocity can be expanded as\r
v¯ = −c ± κ (r − r1,2) + O\r
\u0010\r
(r − r1,2)\r
2\r
\u0011\r
. (35)\r
Thus, we obtain\r
u ≃ t ∓\r
1\r
κ\r
ln |r − r1,2| . (36)\r
On the other hand, the coordinate U, obtained by inte\u0002grating Eq. (33) at early times, reduces to the Minkowski\r
null coordinate\r
U(t → −∞) = t −\r
r\r
c\r
, (37)\r
and is regular in the whole spacetime, in particular, on\r
the horizons. For instance, on a fixed t slice in the sta\u0002tionary region, we can write U as a regular function of\r
r\r
U± = U± (r − r1,2) , (38)\r
where we denoted with U+ (respectively, U−) the specific\r
form of U close to the black (respectively, white) horizon,\r
and U± are analytic functions. Inserting Eq. (36) in the\r
above expression, at the same fixed time,\r
U± = p(u → ±∞) = P±(e\r
∓κu) , (39)\r
where P± are again analytic functions. Note that the\r
forms of these functions do not depend on the particu\u0002lar time slice chosen to perform the matching between\r
Eqs. (36) and (38). In the proximity of the stationary\r
horizons u → ±∞, so e\r
∓κu → 0 and the function p can\r
be expanded around the horizons. Up to the first order\r
we get\r
U = p(u → ±∞) = U BH\r
WH\r
∓ A±e\r
∓κu + O\r
\r
e\r
∓2κu\u0001\r
, (40)\r
where A± are positive constants.\r
This is indeed the asymptotic behavior one would ex\u0002pect in the presence of trapping horizons and, for the\r
black hole case, it is the standard relation between u and\r
U. In fact, it leads to the conclusion that an observer\r
at I + will detect Hawking radiation with temperature\r
κ/2π. It is important to note that the result is completely\r
general. The asymptotic behavior of U = p(u) for large\r
absolute values of u, which is the only feature of p(u) rel\u0002evant for the analysis of this paper, does not depend on\r
the specific velocity profile adopted. It is only necessary\r
that it interpolates from Minkowski spacetime at early\r
times to a stationary warp-drive geometry at late times.\r
While Eq. (40) is exactly of the expected form, its im\u0002plications for particle production are not as straightfor\u0002ward as in the black hole case. In fact, in the warp-drive\r
geometry the late-time modes labeled by u will not be\r
standard plane waves in an asymptotically flat region of\r
spacetime as they will be characterized by the strange\r
form given in Eq. (36). Of course, if the surface gravity\r
κ is large enough so that the typical wavelength of the

7\r
emitted radiation is much smaller than the bubble size,\r
then the plane-wave approximation is fine and in the cen\u0002ter of the bubble, at late times, one will measure standard\r
Hawking radiation at temperature T . Nonetheless, in the\r
general case, even if the calculation for the Bogoliubov\r
coefficient is the standard one [13], the particles created\r
will not be standard plane waves. The physics associ\u0002ated with the particle production by the white horizon\r
is even less clear. This is why, in the next section, we\r
shall consider the behavior RSET to get more significant\r
information.\r
In order to do so, we shall also need the relation be\u0002tween ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. In fact, these\r
modes are excited too when the warp drive forms, even\r
if we do not have a thermal particle production as for\r
right-going modes. Left-going rays are the solution of\r
the following differential equation [see Eq. (33)]:\r
dr\r
dt = −c + ˆv(r, t) . (41)\r
Looking at Fig. 3, we note that left-going rays do not see\r
the horizons, that is, they cross them from I\r
−\r
R to I\r
+\r
L\r
.\r
As a consequence, both the past and the future null co\u0002ordinates W and w are defined at the asymptotic region\r
outside the bubble. However, after the geometry inside\r
the bubble has settled down to its final stationary form,\r
we can define, just for convenience, a different coordinate\r
w˜ inside the bubble, as in Eq. (8):\r
dw˜ = dt +\r
dr\r
c − v¯(r)\r
. (42)\r
Note that w and ˜w may or may not coincide depending on\r
how fast the metric in the external region settles down to\r
its final stationary form (refer to Fig. 4 and Appendix A\r
for an example in which they do not coincide).\r
W is obtained in the usual way, by integrating Eq. (41)\r
at early times, when the spacetime is Minkowski\r
W(t → −∞) = t +\r
r\r
c\r
, (43)\r
The relation W = q( ˜w) can be found explicitly for specific\r
cases (see Appendix A). The important point is that one\r
can prove that this relation is always regular, so that\r
it cannot give place to any phenomenon like Hawking\r
radiation. Of course, one can choose a very unusual way\r
to interpolate from Minkowski to the warp drive, such\r
that a lot of particles are created in this sector, but this\r
is not a general feature of dynamical warp drives. If we\r
use a regular enough transition, only transient effects are\r
present in this sector. In Appendix A, we shall show that\r
it is possible to find such a transition.\r
As an example, in Fig. 4 we plot both right-going and\r
left-going light rays propagating in the particular dy\u0002namic warp-drive spacetime analyzed in Appendix A.\r

Minkowskian. The horizons at r1 and r2 (heavy dashed lines)\r
are formed at TH = 1. Please refer to Appendix A for details.\r
IV. RENORMALIZED STRESS-ENERGY\r
TENSOR\r
For the calculation of the RSET inside the warp-drive\r
bubble we can use the method used in [10] for a collapsing\r
configuration to form a black hole. In null coordinates U\r
and W, affine on I −, the metric can be written as\r
ds2 = −C(U, W)dU dW . (44)\r
As we described in the previous section, in the out re\u0002gion (the region in which the metric is stationary, i.e.,\r
v¯ depends only on r) we can also use a different set of\r
null coordinates u, w˜. The coordinate u is affine on H +\r
C\r
and ˜w is the coordinate defined in Eq. (42). In these

8\r
coordinates the metric is expressed as\r
ds2 = −C¯(u, w˜)dudw , ˜ (45)\r
which implies\r
C(U, W) = C¯(u, w˜)\r
p˙(u) ˙q( ˜w)\r
, (46)\r
and\r
U = p(u), W = q( ˜w) . (47)\r
These transformations are such that the C¯ has precisely\r
the form of the future stationary warp-drive geometry,\r
that is, it depends only on r through u, w˜.\r
For concreteness let us refer to the RSET associated\r
with having a single quantum massless scalar field living\r
on the spacetime. In this case the RSET components\r
have the following form [13]:\r
TUU = −\r

Qualitatively, things would not change if there were other\r
fields present in the theory. The only modification will\r
be that the previous expressions will get multiplied by\r
a specific numerical factor. It is clear that in the in re\u0002gion (where the spacetime is Minkowskian) the RSET is\r
trivially zero.\r
Now, for a metric in the form of Eq. (44), the curvature\r
can be calculated as in [13]:\r

We can express the derivatives with respect to u and\r

that the following expressions are obtained from Eqs. (34)\r
and (42), so they are valid only when the velocity profile\r
depends only on the r coordinate. In this fashion, we can\r
study the stress-energy tensor at the end of the creation\r
of the warp drive (or at the end of a collapse if we are\r
studying a black hole).\r

We are interested in calculating the RSET inside the\r
bubble when the two horizons have been formed and\r
when the configuration has settled down to a station\u0002ary warp drive. Since in this region the velocity depends\r
only on r, we can replace the derivatives in Eqs. (53),\r

One can check that these quantities do not diverge at the\r

We want to study what happens to a spaceship placed\r
at rest in the center of the bubble to investigate whether a\r
warp drive can be used as a transportation device. More\u0002over we want to check whether the components of the\r
RSET in a regular coordinate system are regular at the\r
horizons. Freely falling observers are at rest in the center\r
of the bubble but left moving otherwise.\r
Looking at the above expressions for any component\r
of the RSET or at the energy density ρ, we see that they\r
can be split as a sum of three terms, one purely static,\r
depending only on the r coordinate through the shift\r
velocity ¯v, and two dynamic pieces depending also on\r
the u and ˜w coordinates, respectively. They correspond\r
to energy traveFling on right-going and left-going light\r
rays, respectively, eventually red/blue-shifted by a term\r
depending on r. Being interested in studying the energy\r
density measured by free-falling observers, we write\r
ρ = ρst + ρdyn−u + ρdyn−w˜ , (71)\r
where we defined static terms (labeled by subscript st)\r
and dynamic terms (labeled by subscript dyn) for each\r
component. Right-going and left-going terms are respec\u0002tively labeled by u and ˜w.\r

Let us start with ρdyn−w˜. Its denominator is bounded for\r
each r because the shift velocity is negative, and its nu\u0002merator is vanishing with time. It is easy to convince one\u0002self that all the contributions to the RSET coming from\r
the ˜w sector are not universal but depend exclusively on\r
the specific interpolation between the early Minkowski\r
spacetime and the final warp-drive spacetime. It is al\u0002ways possible to choose an interpolation so that all these\r
contributions vanish at late times (see Appendix A).\r
From now on, we neglect the dynamic term ρdyn−w˜\r
and study\r
ρ ≃ ρst + ρdyn−u . (75)\r
A. RSET at the center of the warp-drive bubble\r
We shall now study the behavior of the RSET in the\r
center of the bubble at late times. In this point ¯v(r =\r
0) = ¯v\r
′\r
(r = 0) = 0 and the static term ρst vanishes.\r
By integrating Eq. (34) in the stationary region, one can\r
show that u(t, r) is linear in t so that, for fixed r, it\r
will acquire arbitrarily large positive values (see Fig. 3).\r
The dynamic term in Eq. (73) can be evaluated by using\r
a late-time expansion of p(u) [see Eqs. (40) and (C2)],\r
then plugged in Eq. (69). This is derived in Appendix C\r
and it is equal to\r

Defining the Hawking temperature in the usual way as\r
TH ≡ κ/2π, it is easy to see that Eq. (77) can be rewrit\u0002ten exactly as ρ = (π/12)TH\r
2\r
. Thus, the observer inside\r
the warp-drive bubble will indeed observe thermal radi\u0002ation at the temperature TH.\r
B. RSET at the bubble horizons\r
Let us move now to study ρ close to the horizons. Note\r
that both ρst and ρdyn−u are divergent at the horizons\r
(r → r1,2) because of the (1 + ¯v) factors in the denom\u0002inator. Just like in [10], for a black hole, these diver\u0002gences exactly cancel each other, but something different\r
happens at the black and white horizon. Expanding the\r
velocity up to the second order one gets\r
v¯±(r) = −1±κ (r − r1,2)+1\r

where σ is a constant.\r
Close to the horizons the static term of Eq. (72) then\r
becomes\r

Similarly one can expand the dynamic term ρdyn−u to\r
the same order. This involves determining the function\r
f(u) in the proximity of the horizons. Indeed it is not\r
difficult to show that (see Appendix C)\r

It is now clear that the total ρ is O(1) on the horizon and\r
does not diverge (as expected from the Fulling-Sweeny\u0002Wald theorem [15]).\r

where C± are constants. We can easily see that the be\u0002havior close to the black horizon is completely different\r
from that close to the white horizon. In the former case\r
the energy density as seen by a free-falling observer is\r
damped exponentially with time. In the white horizon,\r
however, this energy density grows exponentially with\r
time. This means that, moving along H −\r
2\r
, ρ is large and\r
negative diverging while approaching the crossing point\r
between H −\r
2\r
and H +\r
C\r
.\r
This asymptotic divergence is physical and not a mat\u0002ter of selection of coordinates. In a very short time after\r
the white horizon is formed (of the order of 1/κ), the\r
backreaction of the RSET in this region of spacetime is\r
no longer negligible but rather very strong.\r
C. RSET at late times approaching H +\r
C\r
In Sec. IV B we studied the RSET on the black and\r
white horizons. However, it is interesting to analyze bet\u0002ter its behavior as it approaches the Cauchy horizon H +\r
C\r
.\r
As one can see from Fig. 4, every u ray reaches values of\r
r very close to r2, at sufficiently late times. This means\r
that, even for large positive values of u, some time exists\r
after which the approximate behavior of all the u rays is\r
well described by\r
u ≃ t +\r
1\r
κ\r
ln (r2 − r) , (84)\r
so that\r
r2 − r ∝ e\r
−κt\r
. (85)\r
Keeping in mind this point, let us study the term ρdyn−u,\r
at fixed u, when time increases. There is a time at which\r
the u ray will be close enough to r2, such that the de\u0002nominator in Eq. (73) can be approximated by\r
(1 + ¯v)\r
2 ≃ κ\r
2\r
(r2 − r)\r
2\r
, (86)\r
which becomes, thanks to the previous result,\r
(1 + ¯v)\r
2\r
∝ e\r
−2κt\r
, (87)\r
such that, for t → +∞, ρ diverges along every single\r
u ray as e\r
+2κt, because of the blueshift factor (1 + ¯v)2\r
.\r
Hence, ρ will diverge on the whole line H +\r
C\r
, which is

11\r
a Cauchy horizon for the geometry (so this result does\r
not contradict the Fulling-Sweeny-Wald theorem [15]).\r
We then deduce that the warp-drive spacetime is again\r
likely to become unstable in a very short time.\r
As a closing remark, it is perhaps important to stress\r
that this divergence of the RSET on the Cauchy hori\u0002zon is of different nature with respect to the one found\r
in Sec. IV B. In fact, the divergence of Sec. IV B is in\u0002trinsically due to the inevitable transient disturbances\r
produced by the formation of the horizon. In this sense\r
it is a new and very effective instability present every\r
time a white horizon is formed in some dynamical way.\r
On the contrary, the just found divergence on H +\r
C\r
can\r
be seen as due to the well-known infinite blueshift suf\u0002fered by light rays as they approach a Cauchy horizon, in\r
this specific case as due to the accumulation of Hawking\r
radiation produced by the black horizon. In this sense it\r
is not very different from the often claimed instability of\r
inner horizons in Kerr-Newman black holes [16, 17, 18].\r
Of course the divergence and the appearance of the\r
horizon H +\r
C would be avoided if the superluminal warp\r
drive were sustained just for a finite amount of time. In\r
that case, no Cauchy horizons would arise and no actual\r
infinity would be reached by the RSET. However, the\r
latter would still become huge in a very short time, in\u0002creasing exponentially on a time scale 1/κ ≈ ∆/c, where\r
∆ is the thickness of the warp-drive bubble. Note that,\r
in order to get a time scale of even 1 s, one would need\r
∆ ≈ 3 × 108 m.\r
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\r
We have described the causal structure of both eter\u0002nal and dynamical warp drives. In a geometric optics\r
approximation we have studied the propagation of light\r
rays in dynamical geometries and found that the same ex\u0002ponential relation between affine coordinates on I − and\r
H +\r
C\r
is recovered at late times (large u) as in the case\r
of black hole spacetimes. Given this relation it is un\u0002avoidable the conclusion that indeed a Hawking flux will\r
be observed by any observer inside the warp-drive bub\u0002ble far from the black horizon. Indeed, the calculation\r
shows explicitly the onset of such a flux. This radiation\r
is produced at the black horizon and soon fills the in\u0002terior of the bubble, traveling rightward at the speed of\r
light. The central region of the warp drive behaves like\r
the asymptotic region of a black hole: In both these re\u0002gions the static contribution (ρst) to the energy density\r
vanishes so that the total energy density is due solely to\r
the Hawking radiation generated at the black horizon.\r
When creating a warp drive one not only forms a black\r
horizon but also a white one. Both are sources of right\u0002going radiation. To understand better the nature of this\r
radiation we have calculated the RSET in this geome\u0002try and, in particular, the energy density as measured\r
by freely falling observers. In this way we recover that\r
the RSET does not diverge at the horizons at any finite\r
time. The singular behavior of the static terms (or vac\u0002uum polarization terms) in the RSET at the horizons is\r
canceled by the leading contributions of the dynamical\r
right-going terms, or what is equivalent, by the presence\r
of Hawking radiation at both the horizons.\r
It is however easy to see that the subleading terms of\r
Eq. (83) behavior is rather different between the black\r
and the white horizons. The subleading term in the\r
RSET associated with the formation of the black hori\u0002zon does not produce any significative backreaction on\r
the horizon itself. In fact, this term is just a transient\r
which decays exponentially.9\r
The formation of a white horizon is also associated\r
with a similar subleading term, but this time it accu\u0002mulates onto the white horizon itself. This causes the\r
energy density ρ seen by a free-falling observer to grow\r
unboundedly with time on this horizon. The semiclassi\u0002cal backreaction of the RSET will make the superluminal\r
warp drive become rapidly unstable, in a time scale of\r
the order of 1/κ2, the inverse of the surface gravity of\r
the white horizon. Indeed, if one trusted the QI [6, 8],\r
the wall thickness for v0 ≈ c would be ∆ . 102 LP , and\r
the surface gravity κ & 10−2tP\r
−1\r
, where tP is the Planck\r
time.10 This means that the time scale over which the\r
backreaction of the RSET would become important is\r
τ ∼ 1/κ . 102tP . Indeed, even forgetting about the QI,\r
in order to get even a time scale τ ∼ 1 s for the growing\r
rate of the RSET, one would need a wall as large as 3×108\r
m. Therefore, most probably one would be able to main\u0002tain a superluminal speed for just a very short interval of\r
time. In addition to the above mentioned growing term\r
on H −\r
2 we have shown that there is also an unbounded\r
accumulation of Hawking radiation on H +\r
C\r
. Also this\r
contribution will very rapidly lead to a significant back\u0002reaction on the superluminal warp drive and to some sort\r
of semiclassical instability of the solution (that will most\r
probably prevent the formation of the Cauchy horizons\r
at late times).\r
Interestingly, recent investigations [19] seem to im\u0002ply that the above found asymptotic divergences of the\r
RSET on the white horizon might disappear if Lorentz\r
symmetry gets broken at high energies. While in this\r
case we still expect that the RSET will acquire large val\u0002ues soon after the white horizon is formed, we do not\r
know if this would be enough to prevent the sustainabil\u00029 Furthermore, the analogy with a black hole originated by a star\r
collapse of [10] also allows us to infer that the warp drive must\r
be created very rapidly in order to avoid a huge accumulation of\r
vacuum polarization at the horizon and so a huge initial value of\r
the energy density.\r
10 In 1 + 1 dimensions the warp-drive configuration is actually a\r
vacuum solution of Einstein equations. In this case, QI will not\r
impose any conditions on the size of the wall thickness. However,\r
as we will show, we expect our results to be valid also in 3 + 1\r
dimensions. Therefore, we use the wall thickness of 3 + 1 warp\r
drives to obtain a realistic estimation for the Hawking tempera\u0002ture and the time scale of the exponential growing of the RSET.

12\r
ity of the warp drive. We think that this issue could be\r
subject for future research perhaps within the context of\r
analog models of gravity (see [20] for a complete review\r
on analog models) where it might even be addressed ex\u0002perimentally.\r
Even if the above described semiclassical instability\r
could be avoided by some external action on the warp\u0002drive bubble (or by some appropriate UV completion of\r
the quantum field theory, like in [19]), the QI lead to\r
the conclusion that the Hawking radiation in the center\r
of the bubble will burn the internal observer with an\r
excruciating temperature of TH ∼ κ & 10−2 TP , where\r
TP is the Planck temperature, about 1032 K. This would\r
prevent the use of a superluminal warp drive for any kind\r
of practical purpose. If we do not trust the QI, this high\r
temperature might be avoided by making thicker walls.\r
For instance, with ∆ ∼ 1 m, one obtains a temperature\r
of about 0.003 K (roughly the temperature of radiation\r
at a wavelength of 1 m).11\r
Finally we want to comment on the fact that in this\r
paper a 1+1 calculation was performed. Generally in\r
spherically symmetric spacetimes this could be seen as\r
an s-wave approximation to the correct results. How\u0002ever, this is not the case for the axisymmetric warp-drive\r
geometry. However, we do expect that the salient fea\u0002tures of our results would be maintained in a full 3+1\r
calculation (most probably a numerical one) given that\r
they will still be valid in a suitable open set of the hori\u0002zons centered around the axis aligned with the direction\r
of motion.\r
In conclusion, we think that this work is casting strong\r
doubts about the semiclassical stability of superluminal\r
warp drives. Of course, all the aforementioned problems\r
disappear when the bubble remains subluminal. In that\r
case no horizons form, no Hawking radiation is created,\r
and neither strong temperature nor white horizon insta\u0002bility is found. The only remaining problem is that one\r
would still need the presence of some amount of exotic\r
matter to maintain the subluminal drive.\r

APPENDIX A: AN EXAMPLE OF DYNAMICAL\r
WARPDRIVE\r
In this Appendix we want to present a model of dy\u0002namical warpdrive, which we used for numerical calcu\u0002lation. It is particularly useful because it allows one to\r
carry out an almost complete analytical treatment. We\r
adapt here the method presented in [14, 21] for stellar\r
collapses to the creation of a warp drive from Minkowski\r
spacetime. We can choose a simplified piecewise velocity\r
profile, which has the relevant properties of a dynamical\r
warp drive, i.e., it describes a flat geometry at early times\r
and coincides with the metric in Eq. (4) after some finite\r
time t > 0.\r
Using our velocity profile defined in Eq. (5)\r
v¯(r) = αc [f(r) − 1] , (A1)\r
we can define a dynamical profile by replacing ˆv in\r
Eq. (31) by ˆvkink\r
vˆkink(r, t) = \u001A\r
v¯(ξ(t)) if |r| ≥ ξ(t) ,\r
v¯(r) if |r| < ξ(t) ,\r
(A2)\r
where ξ(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t,\r
such that ξ(t) → 0, for t → −∞, and ξ(tH) = r2 = −r1.\r
One may wonder whether defining a velocity profile\r
with a kink, as in Eq. (A2), may lead to unphysical phe\u0002nomena. Indeed this computational trick induces some\r
spurious effects, but these features are just transients and\r
do not affect the results at late times.\r
1. Right-going rays\r
We apply the same procedure of [14] to calculate the\r
exact relation between the past null coordinate U in I\r
−\r
L\r
and the future null coordinate relevant at H +\r
C\r
. To find\r
this relation one has to find the integral curves of the ray\r
differential equation (33), which becomes at early times\r

and in a neighborhood of H +\r

and for the second one\r
t = D −\r

Following [14] we identify initial events P ≡ (ri, ti), with\r
ri ∼ cti, final events Q ≡ (rf , tf ) with rf ∼ r2 − e\r
−κtf\r
,\r
and intermediate events O ≡ (r0, t0).

velocity profile depends only on t), we find\r
r0 − ri =\r

We now want to find the relation between U and u. It\r
is possible to find a particular form for the kink function\r
ξ (see Fig. 4 and its caption for an example), such that all\r
the rays cross either the left kink r = −ξ(t) or the right\r
kink r = +ξ(t) only once. The event ”crossing the kink”\r
can be seen as belonging to both the in region and the\r
out region. Therefore the relation U = p(u) can be found\r
by eliminating t0 and r0 between expressions (A10) and\r
(A13) taking into account that r0 will be either −ξ(t0)\r
or +ξ(t0). Figure 4 shows an exact numerical calculation\r
of ray propagation, performed with this method.\r
However, in order to study the late-time behavior of\r
both particle production and the RSET, we only need the\r
previous relation (see Sec. III) for large and positive val\u0002ues of u (the location of the black horizon) and for large\r
and negative values of u (the location of the white hori\u0002zon). We want to show here that our particular example\r
leads in fact to the general relation Eq. (40). In this spe\u0002cific case, taking the limit for |u| → ∞ corresponds to\r
study the previous relation for light rays crossing the left\r
kink at r0 = −ξ(t0), when r0 is very close to r1 [respec\u0002tively, crossing the right kink at r0 = +ξ(t0), when r0\r
is very close to r2]. First note that, when t → tH (the\r
time of the first appearance of the trapping horizons) the\r
function ξ can be expanded in the following form:\r
ξ(t) = r2 + λ (t − tH) + O\r

with λ a positive constant (remember that we have cho\u0002sen for simplicity r1 = −r2). Defining\r

for rays crossing the kink close to r1 [respectively, with\r
U− we denote the form of the function U(t0) for rays\r
crossing the kink close to to r1]. By expanding Eq. (A13)\r
in the same limit t0 → tH and retaining only the domi\u0002nant term we obtain\r

2. Left-going rays\r
In Sec. IV we stated that it is possible to find a wide\r
class of transitions from a Minkowskian geometry to a\r
warp-drive one such that the contributions to the RSET\r
due to left-going modes are just transient, vanishing at\r
late times. We show here that this is the case for our\r
specific model.\r
In order to do so, we shall need the relation between\r
ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. Left-going rays are\r
the solution of the differential equation (41) which be\u0002comes at early times\r
dr\r
dt = −c , (A20)\r
while inside the bubble we cannot take any limit as in\r
Eq. (A4) because left-going rays are not confined inside\r
the bubble, but escape through the black horizon, as we\r
already noticed in Sec. III. Integrating the equation at\r
early times we obtain\r
t = C −\r
r\r
c\r
. (A21)\r
We identify initial events P ≡ (ri, ti), with ri ∼ cti, final\r
events Q ≡ (rf , tf ), and intermediate events O ≡ (r0, t0)\r
either in the in region (when the velocity profile depends\r
only on t) or in the out region (when the velocity profile\r
depends only on r).\r
Using ˜w defined as in Eq. (42), choosing arbitrarily the\r
constant of integration, we obtain\r
w˜(t0, r0) ≡ t0 +\r
Z r0\r
0\r
dr\r
c − v¯(r)\r
. (A22)\r
For W we proceed as for U. We integrate Eq. (41)\r
between P and an event O in the in region\r
r0 − ri =\r
Z t0\r
ti\r
dt[−c + ¯v(ξ(t))] . (A23)\r
Defining W as\r
W = lim ti→−∞ \u0010ti +\r
ri\r
c\r
\u0011\r
, (A24)\r
we obtain\r
W = t0 +\r
r0\r
c\r
−\r
1\r
c\r
Z t0\r
−∞\r
dtv¯(ξ(t)) . (A25)\r
Now, the relation W = q( ˜w) can be found eliminating\r
t0, r0 from Eqs. (42) and (A25) in the limit where (t0, r0)\r
is on the kink.\r
We can now show that indeed the term ρdyn−w˜ defined\r
in Eq. (74) is just a transient for this model. We see from\r
Fig. 4 that, as time grows, points inside the bubble are\r
reached by ˜w rays that intersect the kink later and later.\r
Using Eqs. (42) and (A25) we can estimate ˙q, calculating\r
the derivatives of ˜w and W with respect to t on the kink,\r

This is a constant value greater than 0. As a conse\u0002quence, all the derivatives of ˙q go to zero as time grows\r
and ρdyn−w˜ must go to zero in the same way. In con\u0002clusion, the dynamic term originated by the distortion of\r
left-going rays can be different from zero when the hori\u0002zon is created. However, this is only a transient term that\r
is brought toward I\r

, i.e., outside the bubble. That is,\r
it is possible to create a transition region such that some\r
radiation traveling leftward is produced only at the onset\r
of the warp drive, but there is not any phenomenon like\r
Hawking radiation originated in this way.\r
APPENDIX B: NULL COORDINATES\r
In this Appendix we summarize some results concern\u0002ing systems of null coordinates. In Sec. III we defined two\r
sets of null coordinates (U, W) and (u, w˜) obtained by in\u0002tegrating equations of light propagation, respectively, in\r
the in region, in which the metric is Minkowskian, and in\r
the out region, in which it depends on r (after the kink,\r
in the particular example of Appendix A). Now, let us\r
rewrite the metric using the set of coordinates (u, w˜). In\r
the out region, using Eqs. (34) and (42):\r
ur = −\r
1\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
, w˜r =\r
1\r
c − v¯(r)\r
,\r
ut = 1 , w˜t = 1 .\r
(B1)\r
Now we put these expressions into Eq. (45):\r
ds2 = −C¯(u, w˜)dudw˜\r
= −C¯(u, w˜) (utdt + urdr) ( ˜wtdt + ˜wrdr)\r
=\r

2\r
o\r
. (B2)\r
By comparison with Eq. (31) we obtain\r
C¯(u, w˜) = c\r
2 − v¯(r)2\r
, (B3)\r
Note that the definition of U and W can be extended\r
in the out region by following the light rays coming from\r
the in region (in the model of Appendix A by matching\r
on the kink the solutions of U and W with those of u\r
and ˜w). For instance, one can naturally define U(t, r) in\r
the out region as U(t, r) = p (u(t, r)) and in analogous

15\r
ways for the other null coordinate. This means that it\r
makes sense to take derivatives of the null coordinates\r
with respect to r and t in all the spacetime. We write\r
here the derivatives of U and W in the out region:\r
Ur = ˙p(u)ur = −\r
p˙(u)\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
, Wr = ˙q( ˜w) ˜wr =\r
q˙( ˜w)\r
c − v¯(r)\r
,\r
Ut = ˙p(u)ut = ˙p(u) , Wt = ˙q( ˜w) ˜wt = ˙q( ˜w) .\r

U± = p(u → ±∞) = P±(e\r

Warp drives are very interesting configurations in general relativity: At least theoretically, they\r
provide a way to travel at superluminal speeds, albeit at the cost of requiring exotic matter to exist\r
as solutions of Einstein’s equations. However, even if one succeeded in providing the necessary exotic\r
matter to build them, it would still be necessary to check whether they would survive to the switching\r
on of quantum effects. Semiclassical corrections to warp-drive geometries have been analyzed only\r
for eternal warp-drive bubbles traveling at fixed superluminal speeds. Here, we investigate the more\r
realistic case in which a superluminal warp drive is created out of an initially flat spacetime. First of\r
all we analyze the causal structure of eternal and dynamical warp-drive spacetimes. Then we pass to\r
the analysis of the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a quantum field in these geometries.\r
While the behavior of the RSET in these geometries has close similarities to that in the geometries\r
associated with gravitational collapse, it shows dramatic differences too. On one side, an observer\r
located at the center of a superluminal warp-drive bubble would generically experience a thermal\r
flux of Hawking particles. On the other side, such Hawking flux will be generically extremely high\r
if the exotic matter supporting the warp drive has its origin in a quantum field satisfying some form\r
of quantum inequalities. Most of all, we find that the RSET will exponentially grow in time close\r
to, and on, the front wall of the superluminal bubble. Consequently, one is led to conclude that the\r
warp-drive geometries are unstable against semiclassical backreaction.\r

I. INTRODUCTION\r
Since Alcubierre introduced them [1], warp drives have\r
been certainly one of the most studied spacetime geome\u0002tries among those requiring exotic matter for its existence\r
(see [2] for a recent review about “exotic spacetimes”).\r
They were immediately recognized as interesting configu\u0002rations for two main reasons. First, they provide, at least\r
theoretically, a way to travel at superluminal speeds: A\r
warp drive can be described as a spheroidal bubble sep\u0002arating an almost flat internal region from an external\r
asymptotically flat spacetime with respect to which the\r
bubble moves at an arbitrary speed. The idea is that\r
although on top of a spacetime nothing can move with\r
speeds greater than that of light, spacetime itself has no\r
a priori restriction on the speed with which it can be\r
stretched. Second, they provide an exciting ground for\r
testing our comprehension of general relativity (GR) and\r
quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (for instance\r
when investigating warp-drive implications for causality\r
[3]).\r

that would be required to support them."""

realized that this was not only related to the size of the\r
warp-drive bubble but also determined by the thickness\r
of the bubble walls [6]. It was found that, if the ex\u0002oticity was provided by the quantum nature of a field,\r
satisfying therefore the so-called quantum inequalities\r
(QI),\r
2\r
then the violations of the energy conditions would\r
have to be confined to Planck-size regions, making the\r

0 > c), it was later rec\u0002ognized [4, 5] that energy-conditions-violating matter is needed\r
also for subluminal speeds. This points out that the need of\r
exotic matter is peculiar of the warp-drive geometry itself, not\r
appearing only in the superluminal regime."""

2\r
engineering can be improved by resorting to a modified\r
warp-drive configuration with a reduced surface area but\r
the same bubble volume [8]. The total amount of neg\u0002ative energy required to support these warp drives be\u0002comes quite small (for example, |E−| ≈ 0.3M⊙ for a 100\r
m-radius bubble, although one has to add as well some\r
positive energy outside the bubble E+ ≈ 2.5M⊙), bring\u0002ing the warp drive closer to a realistic solution albeit still\r
far from foreseeable realizations.\r
Regarding the feasibility of warp-drive configurations,\r
a parallel line of research has focused on the study of their\r
robustness against the introduction of quantum correc\u0002tions to GR. In particular, in [9] it was studied what\r
would be the effect of having semiclassical corrections in\r
the case of an eternal superluminal warp drive. There,\r
it was noticed that to an observer within the warp-drive\r
bubble, the backward and forward walls (along the di\u0002rection of motion) look, respectively, like the horizon of\r
a black hole and of a white hole. By imposing over the\r
spacetime a quantum state which is vacuum at the null\r
infinities (i.e., what one may call the analog of the Boul\u0002ware state for an eternal black hole) it was found that\r
the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) diverges\r
at the horizons.4Independently of the availability of ex\u0002otic matter to build the warp drive in the first place, the\r
existence of a divergence of the RSET at the horizons\r
would be telling us that it is not possible to create a\r
warp-drive geometry within the context of semiclassical\r
GR: Semiclassical effects would destroy any superlumi\u0002nal warp drive. However, in a more realistic situation,\r
a warp drive would have to be created at a very low ve\u0002locity in a given reference frame and then accelerated\r
to superluminal speeds. One may then expect that the\r
quantum state globally defined on such dynamical geom\u0002etry would be automatically selected by the dynamics\r
once suitable boundary conditions are provided (e.g., at\r
early times). This is indeed the case for a gravitational\r
collapse where it can be shown that, whenever a trap\u0002ping horizon forms, the globally defined quantum state\r
that is vacuum on I − has to be thermal at I + (at the\r
Hawking temperature) and regular at the horizon. In\r
other words, the dynamics of the collapse avoids select\u0002ing a Boulware-like state, with its associated divergence\r
at the horizon, ending up instead selecting the analo\u0002gous for collapsing configurations of the Unruh vacuum\r
state defined on eternal black holes, which leads to a per\u0002fectly regular RSET. Is the dynamics of the creation of\r
a warp drive, with its associated selection of the global\r
vacuum state, able to avoid the presence of divergences in\r
the RSET? Indeed, in [9] it was already noticed that an\r
Unruh-like state rather than a Boulware-like state should\r
be expected to describe the quantum state characterizing\r
built warp drives with much larger wall thickness. For example,\r
for ∆ ≃ 1 m, one would only need |E| & 1/4 M⊙.\r
4 Throughout this paper we shall work in the Heisenberg represen\u0002tation so that only operators, not the states, evolve in time.\r
a superluminal warp-drive creation.\r
In this paper we want to settle this issue by explicitly\r
considering the case of a warp drive which is created with\r
zero velocity at early times and then accelerated up to\r
some superluminal speed in a finite amount of time. This\r
can be viewed as the warp-drive analog of a semiclassical\r
black hole collapse [10]. By restricting attention to warp\r
drives in 1 + 1 dimensions (since this is the only case for\r
which one can carry out a complete analytic treatment),\r
we have calculated the RSET in the warp-drive bubble.\r
As we were expecting, we find that in the center of the\r
bubble there is a thermal flux of particles at the Hawk\u0002ing temperature corresponding to the surface gravity of\r
the black horizon. However, the surface gravity can be\r
shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the\r
bubble walls which, as said, has to be of the order of the\r
Planck length if some form of QI holds. Hence, one has\r
to conclude that an internal observer would soon find it\u0002self in the uncomfortable condition of being swamped by\r
a thermal flux at the Planck temperature. Even worse,\r
we do show that the RSET does increase exponentially\r
with time on the white horizon and close to it (while\r
it is regular and small on the black one). This clearly\r
implies that warp drives would become rapidly unstable\r
once superluminal speeds are reached.\r
The plan of the paper is the following. In Sec. II we\r
study the causal structure of both an eternal and a dy\u0002namic warp drive. In Sec. III we discuss the propagation\r
of light rays in a dynamical warp-drive geometry in close\r
analogy with the standard treatment for black holes.5\r
Finally, in Sec. IV we calculate the full RSET using the\r
technique adopted in [10] for black hole formation and\r
look for its divergences. A summary of our results is\r
given in Sec. V.\r
II. CAUSAL STRUCTURE OF A\r
SUPERLUMINAL WARP DRIVE\r
We investigate the causal structure of a warp drive,\r
following the method presented in [12], for spacetimes\r
whose metrics can be written in Painlev´e-Gullstrand co\u0002ordinates. We begin from an eternal warp drive, moving\r
at constant velocity, and then we study a dynamic situ\u0002ation in which a warp-drive bubble is accelerated.\r

but f is now taken to be defined also for negative values of\r
r. Its boundary conditions will be f(0) = 1 and f(r) → 0\r
for r → ±∞. For illustrative purposes, let us choose the\r
following simple bell-shaped function:\r
f(r) = 1\r

Note that ¯v < 0 because the warp drive is right going\r
(v > 0) but v(r) ≤ v0.\r
By definition, at any time the center of the bubble is\r
located at r = 0. The causal structure of this metric can\r
be analyzed following [12]. Let us define the warp-drive\r

noticed for the positions of r1 and r2, in a general situa\u0002tion in which f is not symmetric, the two surface gravities\r
may have different absolute values. However, the one as\u0002sociated with the first horizon (respectively, second hori\u0002zon) will be always positive (respectively, negative). We\r
will soon show that these two horizons represent a black\r
and a white horizon, respectively. Here on, we will con\u0002sider the two surface gravities to have the same absolute\r
value. Retaining different absolute values will not lead\r
to more general results, but will just make the notation\r
heavier.\r
As in Sec. 6 of [12], one can find some transformation\r
Ui = Ui(ui) that close to the horizons behaves as\r
UI(uI → +∞) ≃ UI + AIe\r
−κuI\r
, (14)\r
UII(uII → ±∞) ≃ UII± ∓ AII±e\r
∓κuII\r

UIII(uIII → −∞) ≃ UIII − AIIIe\r
κuIII\r
, (16)\r
where UI, UII+, UII−, and UIII are arbitrary constants\r
and AI, AII+, AII−, and AIII are positive constants. It is\r
possible to choose these transformations such that they\r
match on the horizons, obtaining a global U varying reg\u0002ularly from +∞ to −∞ as r varies from −∞ to +∞. This\r
matching will become natural when dealing with dynam\u0002ical configurations in which the warp drive is created by\r
accelerating the bubble from an initial zero velocity. In\r
order to do that we can choose UI = UII+ ≡ UBH and\r
UII− = UIII ≡ UWH < UBH. In this way the three trans\u0002formation have the following domains:\r
uI ∈ (−∞, +∞) ⇒ UI ∈ (+∞, UBH) , (17)\r
uII ∈ (+∞, −∞) ⇒ UII ∈ (UBH, UWH) , (18)\r
uIII ∈ (−∞, +∞) ⇒ UIII ∈ (UWH, −∞) . (19)\r
For instance, specific transformations having the re\u0002quired properties are the following:\r
UI =\r

UIII = −\r

Now we can bring the right and left infinities to a finite\r
distance by using a compactifying transformation like\r
UI ≡ arctan(UI) , (23)\r
UIII ≡ arctan(UIII) , (24)\r
W ≡ arctan(w) . (25)\r

are found by setting ˆv = −c. In this case a solution does\r
not exist for any value of t, so that the apparent hori\u0002zons are created at infinity at some finite tH. We show\r
this below. Let us write the equation for the apparent\r
horizons in the following form:\r
f(r) = 1 −\r
c\r
v0δ(t)\r
. (32)\r
The function f takes all the values between 0 and 1. In\r
particular, f(r) → 0 for r → ±∞ and f(0) = 1. Besides,\r
the right-hand side of Eq. (32) is a monotonic function\r
of t, such that, for t → −∞, 1 − c/ (v0δ(t)) → −∞\r
and reaches the value 1 − c/v0 > 0 for t ≥ 0. As a\r
consequence, there exists a time tH < 0 so that for t > tH\r
there are always two solutions of Eq. (32), corresponding\r
to a black and a white horizon. These horizons are born\r
at t = tH at spatial infinity and at t = 0 they settle at\r
two fixed positions r1 and r2.\r
Keeping these points in mind, we are able to build the\r
Penrose diagram for the dynamic warp drive (Fig. 3).\r
At early times the metric is approximately Minkowskian,\r
because δ(t) → 0 for t → −∞. Therefore, the causal\r
structure is initially Minkowskian. Then, it progressively\r
changes till t = 0. At this time one has built a stationary\r
warp drive, just as in the previous section. After this\r

gluing together the two behaviors. Again, we are not\r
drawing an analytically extended diagram but only the\r
relevant patch for the analysis that follow in this paper.\r
Given that a timelike observer can reach H +\r
C\r
and H +\r
R\r
in a finite proper time, the geometry can be extended in\r
the future, beyond these lines. This is actually a sub\u0002tle point. In fact, H +\r
C\r
and H +\r
R (which are linked to\r
the formation of a white horizon) are on the boundary\r
of the Cauchy development of I −. In this sense, they\r
are Cauchy horizons given that initial data are assigned\r
only on I −. Hence, as noticed in Sec. II A, an eventual\r
extension would not be unique. In any case such an ex\u0002tension will not be relevant for what will follow, given\r
that we shall limit ourselves to investigating the asymp\u0002totic behavior of the RSET associated with the onset of\r
the superluminal warp drive.\r
Let us highlight here that the dynamic way we have\r
used here to create the warp drive is not the only possible\r
way. In Appendix A, we will also use a different interpo\u0002lation between Minkowski and the warp drive in which\r
the horizons appear also at finite time but at finite r\r
positions (similar to what happens when a homogeneous\r
star collapses to form a black hole).\r
III. LIGHT-RAY PROPAGATION\r
The just discussed causal structure of the dynamical\r
warp drive is naturally leading to the expectation that\r
some sort of Hawking radiation will be produced in a su-

6\r
perluminal warp drive (as well as some transient particle\r
emission). It is well known (see, for example, [13]) that\r
all the information about particle production is encoded\r
in the way in which light rays propagate in a spacetime.\r
That is, it is enough to know how light rays are bended\r
in order to analyze the phenomenon of particle creation.\r
In the dynamical warp drive there is a single past null\r
coordinate but three different future null coordinates as\u0002sociated with the final regions I, II and III, as described\r
before. From here on, we will be dealing exclusively with\r
the connection between the past null coordinate U at I\r
−\r
L\r
and the future null coordinate uII at H +\r
C\r
in the interior\r
of the bubble. Therefore, we will use u to denote uII\r
whenever this does not lead to confusion. As discussed\r
in [14] the relation U = p(u) encodes all the relevant\r
information about particle production.\r
We want to study the features due to the two main\r
properties of a dynamical warp-drive geometry, i.e., the\r
spacetime is Minkowskian at early times and it is a warp\r
drive at late times. In particular, we are not interested\r
in the transient features depending on how the transi\u0002tion between these two regimes is performed. Namely, we\r
need only the behavior close to the horizons and at late\r
times inside the whole bubble. It is clear from Fig. 3 that,\r
if one stays at constant r inside the bubble and moves\r
forward in time one crosses u rays which pass closer and\r
closer to the black horizon. Therefore, once we have de\u0002termined the behavior of p(u) close to the horizons,8 we\r
automatically also have the required information at late\r
times in the whole bubble.\r
In general, the relation U = p(u) is obtained by inte\u0002grating the differential equation for the propagation of\r
right-going light rays\r
dr\r
dt = c + ˆv(r, t) . (33)\r
Note that while in the previous section we considered a\r
specific form of ˆv(r, t) [Eq. (31)] in order to discuss the\r
causal structure of the associated spacetime, here (and in\r
what will follow) the discussion will hold for any ˆv(r, t)\r
that satisfies the requirements ˆv(r, t) → 0, for t → −∞\r
(sufficiently rapid for the spacetime to be asymptotically\r
flat), and ˆv(r, t) = ¯v after some finite time and within\r
the warp-drive bubble. Given the assumption that the\r
spacetime settles down to a stationary warp-drive con\u0002figuration, at late times the velocity profile will depend\r
only on the r coordinate. We can write, as in the sta\u0002tionary case Eq. (7)\r
du = dt −\r
dr\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
. (34)\r
To find the required asymptotic relation one has to in\u0002tegrate this equation in the limit r → r1,2. There, the"""

[[sections]]

be computed exactly in the whole spacetime.\r
velocity can be expanded as\r
v¯ = −c ± κ (r − r1,2) + O\r
\u0010\r
(r − r1,2)\r
2\r
\u0011\r
. (35)\r
Thus, we obtain\r
u ≃ t ∓\r
1\r
κ\r
ln |r − r1,2| . (36)\r
On the other hand, the coordinate U, obtained by inte\u0002grating Eq. (33) at early times, reduces to the Minkowski\r
null coordinate\r
U(t → −∞) = t −\r
r\r
c\r
, (37)\r
and is regular in the whole spacetime, in particular, on\r
the horizons. For instance, on a fixed t slice in the sta\u0002tionary region, we can write U as a regular function of\r
r\r
U± = U± (r − r1,2) , (38)\r
where we denoted with U+ (respectively, U−) the specific\r
form of U close to the black (respectively, white) horizon,\r
and U± are analytic functions. Inserting Eq. (36) in the\r
above expression, at the same fixed time,\r
U± = p(u → ±∞) = P±(e\r
∓κu) , (39)\r
where P± are again analytic functions. Note that the\r
forms of these functions do not depend on the particu\u0002lar time slice chosen to perform the matching between\r
Eqs. (36) and (38). In the proximity of the stationary\r
horizons u → ±∞, so e\r
∓κu → 0 and the function p can\r
be expanded around the horizons. Up to the first order\r
we get\r
U = p(u → ±∞) = U BH\r
WH\r
∓ A±e\r
∓κu + O\r
\r
e\r
∓2κu\u0001\r
, (40)\r
where A± are positive constants.\r
This is indeed the asymptotic behavior one would ex\u0002pect in the presence of trapping horizons and, for the\r
black hole case, it is the standard relation between u and\r
U. In fact, it leads to the conclusion that an observer\r
at I + will detect Hawking radiation with temperature\r
κ/2π. It is important to note that the result is completely\r
general. The asymptotic behavior of U = p(u) for large\r
absolute values of u, which is the only feature of p(u) rel\u0002evant for the analysis of this paper, does not depend on\r
the specific velocity profile adopted. It is only necessary\r
that it interpolates from Minkowski spacetime at early\r
times to a stationary warp-drive geometry at late times.\r
While Eq. (40) is exactly of the expected form, its im\u0002plications for particle production are not as straightfor\u0002ward as in the black hole case. In fact, in the warp-drive\r
geometry the late-time modes labeled by u will not be\r
standard plane waves in an asymptotically flat region of\r
spacetime as they will be characterized by the strange\r
form given in Eq. (36). Of course, if the surface gravity\r
κ is large enough so that the typical wavelength of the

7\r
emitted radiation is much smaller than the bubble size,\r
then the plane-wave approximation is fine and in the cen\u0002ter of the bubble, at late times, one will measure standard\r
Hawking radiation at temperature T . Nonetheless, in the\r
general case, even if the calculation for the Bogoliubov\r
coefficient is the standard one [13], the particles created\r
will not be standard plane waves. The physics associ\u0002ated with the particle production by the white horizon\r
is even less clear. This is why, in the next section, we\r
shall consider the behavior RSET to get more significant\r
information.\r
In order to do so, we shall also need the relation be\u0002tween ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. In fact, these\r
modes are excited too when the warp drive forms, even\r
if we do not have a thermal particle production as for\r
right-going modes. Left-going rays are the solution of\r
the following differential equation [see Eq. (33)]:\r
dr\r
dt = −c + ˆv(r, t) . (41)\r
Looking at Fig. 3, we note that left-going rays do not see\r
the horizons, that is, they cross them from I\r
−\r
R to I\r
+\r
L\r
.\r
As a consequence, both the past and the future null co\u0002ordinates W and w are defined at the asymptotic region\r
outside the bubble. However, after the geometry inside\r
the bubble has settled down to its final stationary form,\r
we can define, just for convenience, a different coordinate\r
w˜ inside the bubble, as in Eq. (8):\r
dw˜ = dt +\r
dr\r
c − v¯(r)\r
. (42)\r
Note that w and ˜w may or may not coincide depending on\r
how fast the metric in the external region settles down to\r
its final stationary form (refer to Fig. 4 and Appendix A\r
for an example in which they do not coincide).\r
W is obtained in the usual way, by integrating Eq. (41)\r
at early times, when the spacetime is Minkowski\r
W(t → −∞) = t +\r
r\r
c\r
, (43)\r
The relation W = q( ˜w) can be found explicitly for specific\r
cases (see Appendix A). The important point is that one\r
can prove that this relation is always regular, so that\r
it cannot give place to any phenomenon like Hawking\r
radiation. Of course, one can choose a very unusual way\r
to interpolate from Minkowski to the warp drive, such\r
that a lot of particles are created in this sector, but this\r
is not a general feature of dynamical warp drives. If we\r
use a regular enough transition, only transient effects are\r
present in this sector. In Appendix A, we shall show that\r
it is possible to find such a transition.\r
As an example, in Fig. 4 we plot both right-going and\r
left-going light rays propagating in the particular dy\u0002namic warp-drive spacetime analyzed in Appendix A.\r

Minkowskian. The horizons at r1 and r2 (heavy dashed lines)\r
are formed at TH = 1. Please refer to Appendix A for details.\r
IV. RENORMALIZED STRESS-ENERGY\r
TENSOR\r
For the calculation of the RSET inside the warp-drive\r
bubble we can use the method used in [10] for a collapsing\r
configuration to form a black hole. In null coordinates U\r
and W, affine on I −, the metric can be written as\r
ds2 = −C(U, W)dU dW . (44)\r
As we described in the previous section, in the out re\u0002gion (the region in which the metric is stationary, i.e.,\r
v¯ depends only on r) we can also use a different set of\r
null coordinates u, w˜. The coordinate u is affine on H +\r
C\r
and ˜w is the coordinate defined in Eq. (42). In these

8\r
coordinates the metric is expressed as\r
ds2 = −C¯(u, w˜)dudw , ˜ (45)\r
which implies\r
C(U, W) = C¯(u, w˜)\r
p˙(u) ˙q( ˜w)\r
, (46)\r
and\r
U = p(u), W = q( ˜w) . (47)\r
These transformations are such that the C¯ has precisely\r
the form of the future stationary warp-drive geometry,\r
that is, it depends only on r through u, w˜.\r
For concreteness let us refer to the RSET associated\r
with having a single quantum massless scalar field living\r
on the spacetime. In this case the RSET components\r
have the following form [13]:\r

Qualitatively, things would not change if there were other\r
fields present in the theory. The only modification will\r
be that the previous expressions will get multiplied by\r
a specific numerical factor. It is clear that in the in re\u0002gion (where the spacetime is Minkowskian) the RSET is\r
trivially zero.\r

We want to study what happens to a spaceship placed\r
at rest in the center of the bubble to investigate whether a\r
warp drive can be used as a transportation device. More\u0002over we want to check whether the components of the\r
RSET in a regular coordinate system are regular at the\r
horizons. Freely falling observers are at rest in the center\r
of the bubble but left moving otherwise.\r
Looking at the above expressions for any component\r
of the RSET or at the energy density ρ, we see that they\r
can be split as a sum of three terms, one purely static,\r
depending only on the r coordinate through the shift\r
velocity ¯v, and two dynamic pieces depending also on\r
the u and ˜w coordinates, respectively. They correspond\r
to energy traveFling on right-going and left-going light\r
rays, respectively, eventually red/blue-shifted by a term\r
depending on r. Being interested in studying the energy\r
density measured by free-falling observers, we write\r
ρ = ρst + ρdyn−u + ρdyn−w˜ , (71)\r
where we defined static terms (labeled by subscript st)\r
and dynamic terms (labeled by subscript dyn) for each\r
component. Right-going and left-going terms are respec\u0002tively labeled by u and ˜w.\r

Let us start with ρdyn−w˜. Its denominator is bounded for\r
each r because the shift velocity is negative, and its nu\u0002merator is vanishing with time. It is easy to convince one\u0002self that all the contributions to the RSET coming from\r
the ˜w sector are not universal but depend exclusively on\r
the specific interpolation between the early Minkowski\r
spacetime and the final warp-drive spacetime. It is al\u0002ways possible to choose an interpolation so that all these\r
contributions vanish at late times (see Appendix A).\r
From now on, we neglect the dynamic term ρdyn−w˜\r
and study\r
ρ ≃ ρst + ρdyn−u . (75)\r
A. RSET at the center of the warp-drive bubble\r
We shall now study the behavior of the RSET in the\r
center of the bubble at late times. In this point ¯v(r =\r
0) = ¯v\r
′\r
(r = 0) = 0 and the static term ρst vanishes.\r
By integrating Eq. (34) in the stationary region, one can\r
show that u(t, r) is linear in t so that, for fixed r, it\r
will acquire arbitrarily large positive values (see Fig. 3).\r
The dynamic term in Eq. (73) can be evaluated by using\r
a late-time expansion of p(u) [see Eqs. (40) and (C2)],\r
then plugged in Eq. (69). This is derived in Appendix C\r

B. RSET at the bubble horizons\r
Let us move now to study ρ close to the horizons. Note\r
that both ρst and ρdyn−u are divergent at the horizons\r
(r → r1,2) because of the (1 + ¯v) factors in the denom\u0002inator. Just like in [10], for a black hole, these diver\u0002gences exactly cancel each other, but something different\r
happens at the black and white horizon. Expanding the\r

from that close to the white horizon. In the former case\r
the energy density as seen by a free-falling observer is\r
damped exponentially with time. In the white horizon,\r
however, this energy density grows exponentially with\r
time. This means that, moving along H −\r
2\r
, ρ is large and\r
negative diverging while approaching the crossing point\r
between H −\r
2\r
and H +\r
C\r
.\r
This asymptotic divergence is physical and not a mat\u0002ter of selection of coordinates. In a very short time after\r
the white horizon is formed (of the order of 1/κ), the\r
backreaction of the RSET in this region of spacetime is\r
no longer negligible but rather very strong.\r
C. RSET at late times approaching H +\r
C\r
In Sec. IV B we studied the RSET on the black and\r
white horizons. However, it is interesting to analyze bet\u0002ter its behavior as it approaches the Cauchy horizon H +\r
C\r
.\r
As one can see from Fig. 4, every u ray reaches values of\r
r very close to r2, at sufficiently late times. This means\r
that, even for large positive values of u, some time exists\r
after which the approximate behavior of all the u rays is\r
well described by\r
u ≃ t +\r
1\r
κ\r
ln (r2 − r) , (84)\r
so that\r
r2 − r ∝ e\r
−κt\r
. (85)\r
Keeping in mind this point, let us study the term ρdyn−u,\r
at fixed u, when time increases. There is a time at which\r
the u ray will be close enough to r2, such that the de\u0002nominator in Eq. (73) can be approximated by\r
(1 + ¯v)\r
2 ≃ κ\r
2\r
(r2 − r)\r
2\r
, (86)\r
which becomes, thanks to the previous result,\r
(1 + ¯v)\r
2\r
∝ e\r
−2κt\r
, (87)\r
such that, for t → +∞, ρ diverges along every single\r
u ray as e\r
+2κt, because of the blueshift factor (1 + ¯v)2\r
.\r
Hence, ρ will diverge on the whole line H +\r
C\r
, which is

11\r
a Cauchy horizon for the geometry (so this result does\r
not contradict the Fulling-Sweeny-Wald theorem [15]).\r
We then deduce that the warp-drive spacetime is again\r
likely to become unstable in a very short time.\r
As a closing remark, it is perhaps important to stress\r
that this divergence of the RSET on the Cauchy hori\u0002zon is of different nature with respect to the one found\r
in Sec. IV B. In fact, the divergence of Sec. IV B is in\u0002trinsically due to the inevitable transient disturbances\r
produced by the formation of the horizon. In this sense\r
it is a new and very effective instability present every\r
time a white horizon is formed in some dynamical way.\r
On the contrary, the just found divergence on H +\r
C\r
can\r
be seen as due to the well-known infinite blueshift suf\u0002fered by light rays as they approach a Cauchy horizon, in\r
this specific case as due to the accumulation of Hawking\r
radiation produced by the black horizon. In this sense it\r
is not very different from the often claimed instability of\r
inner horizons in Kerr-Newman black holes [16, 17, 18].\r
Of course the divergence and the appearance of the\r
horizon H +\r
C would be avoided if the superluminal warp\r
drive were sustained just for a finite amount of time. In\r
that case, no Cauchy horizons would arise and no actual\r
infinity would be reached by the RSET. However, the\r
latter would still become huge in a very short time, in\u0002creasing exponentially on a time scale 1/κ ≈ ∆/c, where\r
∆ is the thickness of the warp-drive bubble. Note that,\r
in order to get a time scale of even 1 s, one would need\r
∆ ≈ 3 × 108 m.\r
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\r
We have described the causal structure of both eter\u0002nal and dynamical warp drives. In a geometric optics\r
approximation we have studied the propagation of light\r
rays in dynamical geometries and found that the same ex\u0002ponential relation between affine coordinates on I − and\r
H +\r
C\r
is recovered at late times (large u) as in the case\r
of black hole spacetimes. Given this relation it is un\u0002avoidable the conclusion that indeed a Hawking flux will\r
be observed by any observer inside the warp-drive bub\u0002ble far from the black horizon. Indeed, the calculation\r
shows explicitly the onset of such a flux. This radiation\r
is produced at the black horizon and soon fills the in\u0002terior of the bubble, traveling rightward at the speed of\r
light. The central region of the warp drive behaves like\r
the asymptotic region of a black hole: In both these re\u0002gions the static contribution (ρst) to the energy density\r
vanishes so that the total energy density is due solely to\r
the Hawking radiation generated at the black horizon.\r
When creating a warp drive one not only forms a black\r
horizon but also a white one. Both are sources of right\u0002going radiation. To understand better the nature of this\r
radiation we have calculated the RSET in this geome\u0002try and, in particular, the energy density as measured\r
by freely falling observers. In this way we recover that\r
the RSET does not diverge at the horizons at any finite\r
time. The singular behavior of the static terms (or vac\u0002uum polarization terms) in the RSET at the horizons is\r
canceled by the leading contributions of the dynamical\r
right-going terms, or what is equivalent, by the presence\r
of Hawking radiation at both the horizons.\r
It is however easy to see that the subleading terms of\r
Eq. (83) behavior is rather different between the black\r
and the white horizons. The subleading term in the\r
RSET associated with the formation of the black hori\u0002zon does not produce any significative backreaction on\r
the horizon itself. In fact, this term is just a transient\r
which decays exponentially.9\r
The formation of a white horizon is also associated\r
with a similar subleading term, but this time it accu\u0002mulates onto the white horizon itself. This causes the\r
energy density ρ seen by a free-falling observer to grow\r
unboundedly with time on this horizon. The semiclassi\u0002cal backreaction of the RSET will make the superluminal\r
warp drive become rapidly unstable, in a time scale of\r
the order of 1/κ2, the inverse of the surface gravity of\r
the white horizon. Indeed, if one trusted the QI [6, 8],\r
the wall thickness for v0 ≈ c would be ∆ . 102 LP , and\r
the surface gravity κ & 10−2tP\r
−1\r
, where tP is the Planck\r
time.10 This means that the time scale over which the\r
backreaction of the RSET would become important is\r
τ ∼ 1/κ . 102tP . Indeed, even forgetting about the QI,\r
in order to get even a time scale τ ∼ 1 s for the growing\r
rate of the RSET, one would need a wall as large as 3×108\r
m. Therefore, most probably one would be able to main\u0002tain a superluminal speed for just a very short interval of\r
time. In addition to the above mentioned growing term\r
on H −\r
2 we have shown that there is also an unbounded\r
accumulation of Hawking radiation on H +\r
C\r
. Also this\r
contribution will very rapidly lead to a significant back\u0002reaction on the superluminal warp drive and to some sort\r
of semiclassical instability of the solution (that will most\r
probably prevent the formation of the Cauchy horizons\r
at late times).\r
Interestingly, recent investigations [19] seem to im\u0002ply that the above found asymptotic divergences of the\r
RSET on the white horizon might disappear if Lorentz\r
symmetry gets broken at high energies. While in this\r
case we still expect that the RSET will acquire large val\u0002ues soon after the white horizon is formed, we do not\r
know if this would be enough to prevent the sustainabil\u00029 Furthermore, the analogy with a black hole originated by a star\r
collapse of [10] also allows us to infer that the warp drive must\r
be created very rapidly in order to avoid a huge accumulation of\r
vacuum polarization at the horizon and so a huge initial value of\r
the energy density."""

vacuum solution of Einstein equations. In this case, QI will not\r
impose any conditions on the size of the wall thickness. However,\r
as we will show, we expect our results to be valid also in 3 + 1\r
dimensions. Therefore, we use the wall thickness of 3 + 1 warp\r
drives to obtain a realistic estimation for the Hawking tempera\u0002ture and the time scale of the exponential growing of the RSET.

subject for future research perhaps within the context of\r
analog models of gravity (see [20] for a complete review\r
on analog models) where it might even be addressed ex\u0002perimentally.\r
Even if the above described semiclassical instability\r
could be avoided by some external action on the warp\u0002drive bubble (or by some appropriate UV completion of\r
the quantum field theory, like in [19]), the QI lead to\r
the conclusion that the Hawking radiation in the center\r
of the bubble will burn the internal observer with an\r
excruciating temperature of TH ∼ κ & 10−2 TP , where\r
TP is the Planck temperature, about 1032 K. This would\r
prevent the use of a superluminal warp drive for any kind\r
of practical purpose. If we do not trust the QI, this high\r
temperature might be avoided by making thicker walls.\r
For instance, with ∆ ∼ 1 m, one obtains a temperature\r
of about 0.003 K (roughly the temperature of radiation\r
at a wavelength of 1 m).11\r
Finally we want to comment on the fact that in this\r
paper a 1+1 calculation was performed. Generally in\r
spherically symmetric spacetimes this could be seen as\r
an s-wave approximation to the correct results. How\u0002ever, this is not the case for the axisymmetric warp-drive\r
geometry. However, we do expect that the salient fea\u0002tures of our results would be maintained in a full 3+1\r
calculation (most probably a numerical one) given that\r
they will still be valid in a suitable open set of the hori\u0002zons centered around the axis aligned with the direction\r
of motion.\r
In conclusion, we think that this work is casting strong\r
doubts about the semiclassical stability of superluminal\r
warp drives. Of course, all the aforementioned problems\r
disappear when the bubble remains subluminal. In that\r
case no horizons form, no Hawking radiation is created,\r
and neither strong temperature nor white horizon insta\u0002bility is found. The only remaining problem is that one\r
would still need the presence of some amount of exotic\r
matter to maintain the subluminal drive.\r

APPENDIX A: AN EXAMPLE OF DYNAMICAL\r
WARPDRIVE\r
In this Appendix we want to present a model of dy\u0002namical warpdrive, which we used for numerical calcu\u0002lation. It is particularly useful because it allows one to\r
carry out an almost complete analytical treatment. We\r
adapt here the method presented in [14, 21] for stellar\r
collapses to the creation of a warp drive from Minkowski\r
spacetime. We can choose a simplified piecewise velocity\r
profile, which has the relevant properties of a dynamical\r
warp drive, i.e., it describes a flat geometry at early times\r
and coincides with the metric in Eq. (4) after some finite\r
time t > 0.\r
Using our velocity profile defined in Eq. (5)\r
v¯(r) = αc [f(r) − 1] , (A1)\r
we can define a dynamical profile by replacing ˆv in\r
Eq. (31) by ˆvkink\r
vˆkink(r, t) = \u001A\r
v¯(ξ(t)) if |r| ≥ ξ(t) ,\r
v¯(r) if |r| < ξ(t) ,\r
(A2)\r
where ξ(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t,\r
such that ξ(t) → 0, for t → −∞, and ξ(tH) = r2 = −r1.\r
One may wonder whether defining a velocity profile\r
with a kink, as in Eq. (A2), may lead to unphysical phe\u0002nomena. Indeed this computational trick induces some\r
spurious effects, but these features are just transients and\r
do not affect the results at late times."""

We now want to find the relation between U and u. It\r
is possible to find a particular form for the kink function\r
ξ (see Fig. 4 and its caption for an example), such that all\r
the rays cross either the left kink r = −ξ(t) or the right\r
kink r = +ξ(t) only once. The event ”crossing the kink”\r
can be seen as belonging to both the in region and the\r
out region. Therefore the relation U = p(u) can be found\r
by eliminating t0 and r0 between expressions (A10) and\r
(A13) taking into account that r0 will be either −ξ(t0)\r
or +ξ(t0). Figure 4 shows an exact numerical calculation\r
of ray propagation, performed with this method.\r
However, in order to study the late-time behavior of\r
both particle production and the RSET, we only need the\r
previous relation (see Sec. III) for large and positive val\u0002ues of u (the location of the black horizon) and for large\r
and negative values of u (the location of the white hori\u0002zon). We want to show here that our particular example\r
leads in fact to the general relation Eq. (40). In this spe\u0002cific case, taking the limit for |u| → ∞ corresponds to\r
study the previous relation for light rays crossing the left\r
kink at r0 = −ξ(t0), when r0 is very close to r1 [respec\u0002tively, crossing the right kink at r0 = +ξ(t0), when r0\r
is very close to r2]. First note that, when t → tH (the\r
time of the first appearance of the trapping horizons) the\r

In Sec. IV we stated that it is possible to find a wide\r
class of transitions from a Minkowskian geometry to a\r
warp-drive one such that the contributions to the RSET\r
due to left-going modes are just transient, vanishing at\r
late times. We show here that this is the case for our\r
specific model.\r
In order to do so, we shall need the relation between\r
ingoing and outgoing left-going rays. Left-going rays are\r
the solution of the differential equation (41) which be\u0002comes at early times\r
dr\r
dt = −c , (A20)\r
while inside the bubble we cannot take any limit as in\r
Eq. (A4) because left-going rays are not confined inside\r
the bubble, but escape through the black horizon, as we\r
already noticed in Sec. III. Integrating the equation at\r
early times we obtain\r
t = C −\r
r\r
c\r
. (A21)\r
We identify initial events P ≡ (ri, ti), with ri ∼ cti, final\r
events Q ≡ (rf , tf ), and intermediate events O ≡ (r0, t0)\r
either in the in region (when the velocity profile depends\r
only on t) or in the out region (when the velocity profile\r
depends only on r).\r
Using ˜w defined as in Eq. (42), choosing arbitrarily the\r
constant of integration, we obtain\r
w˜(t0, r0) ≡ t0 +\r
Z r0\r
0\r
dr\r
c − v¯(r)\r
. (A22)\r
For W we proceed as for U. We integrate Eq. (41)\r
between P and an event O in the in region\r
r0 − ri =\r
Z t0\r

dt[−c + ¯v(ξ(t))] . (A23)\r
Defining W as\r
W = lim ti→−∞ \u0010ti +\r

dtv¯(ξ(t)) . (A25)\r
Now, the relation W = q( ˜w) can be found eliminating\r
t0, r0 from Eqs. (42) and (A25) in the limit where (t0, r0)\r
is on the kink.\r
We can now show that indeed the term ρdyn−w˜ defined\r
in Eq. (74) is just a transient for this model. We see from\r
Fig. 4 that, as time grows, points inside the bubble are\r
reached by ˜w rays that intersect the kink later and later.\r
Using Eqs. (42) and (A25) we can estimate ˙q, calculating\r
the derivatives of ˜w and W with respect to t on the kink,\r
at crossing time tc:\r
q˙ =\r

. (A26)\r
This is a constant value greater than 0. As a conse\u0002quence, all the derivatives of ˙q go to zero as time grows\r
and ρdyn−w˜ must go to zero in the same way. In con\u0002clusion, the dynamic term originated by the distortion of\r
left-going rays can be different from zero when the hori\u0002zon is created. However, this is only a transient term that\r
is brought toward I\r
+\r
L\r
, i.e., outside the bubble. That is,\r
it is possible to create a transition region such that some\r
radiation traveling leftward is produced only at the onset\r
of the warp drive, but there is not any phenomenon like\r
Hawking radiation originated in this way.\r
APPENDIX B: NULL COORDINATES\r
In this Appendix we summarize some results concern\u0002ing systems of null coordinates. In Sec. III we defined two\r
sets of null coordinates (U, W) and (u, w˜) obtained by in\u0002tegrating equations of light propagation, respectively, in\r
the in region, in which the metric is Minkowskian, and in\r
the out region, in which it depends on r (after the kink,\r
in the particular example of Appendix A). Now, let us\r
rewrite the metric using the set of coordinates (u, w˜). In\r
the out region, using Eqs. (34) and (42):\r
ur = −\r
1\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
, w˜r =\r
1\r
c − v¯(r)\r
,\r
ut = 1 , w˜t = 1 .\r
(B1)\r
Now we put these expressions into Eq. (45):\r
ds2 = −C¯(u, w˜)dudw˜\r
= −C¯(u, w˜) (utdt + urdr) ( ˜wtdt + ˜wrdr)\r
=\r
C¯(u, w˜)\r

2 − v¯(r)2\r
n\r
c\r
2\r
dt2 − [dr − v¯(r)dt]\r
2\r
o\r
. (B2)\r
By comparison with Eq. (31) we obtain\r
C¯(u, w˜) = c\r
2 − v¯(r)2\r
, (B3)\r
Note that the definition of U and W can be extended\r
in the out region by following the light rays coming from\r
the in region (in the model of Appendix A by matching\r
on the kink the solutions of U and W with those of u\r
and ˜w). For instance, one can naturally define U(t, r) in\r
the out region as U(t, r) = p (u(t, r)) and in analogous

15\r
ways for the other null coordinate. This means that it\r
makes sense to take derivatives of the null coordinates\r
with respect to r and t in all the spacetime. We write\r
here the derivatives of U and W in the out region:\r
Ur = ˙p(u)ur = −\r
p˙(u)\r
c + ¯v(r)\r
, Wr = ˙q( ˜w) ˜wr =\r
q˙( ˜w)\r
c − v¯(r)\r
,\r
Ut = ˙p(u)ut = ˙p(u) , Wt = ˙q( ˜w) ˜wt = ˙q( ˜w) .\r

APPENDIX C: ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION OF\r
f(u)\r
We know from Sec. III that U can be expanded for\r
large absolute values of u in a Taylor series in e\r
∓κu. In\r
fact we found that\r
U± = p(u → ±∞) = P±(e\r
∓κu) , (C1)\r
where P± are analytic functions. We now expand it up\r
