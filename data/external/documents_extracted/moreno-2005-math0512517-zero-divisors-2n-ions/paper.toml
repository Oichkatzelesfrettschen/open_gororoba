Cayley-Dickson algebras\r
Guillermo Moreno\r
Abstract: In this paper we give methods to construct zero divisors in the\r
Cayley–Dickson algebras An=R\r
2\r
n\r
for n larger than 4. Also we relate the set\r
of zero divisors with suitable Stiefel manifolds.\r

Introduction:\r
In this paper we return to the subject of 97’ authors paper [M1] about\r
the description of the zero divisors in the Cayley-Dickson algebras over the\r
real numbers.\r
This paper must be seen as a sequel of the papers [M1] and [M2] and\r
related to papers [M3] and [M4].\r
As we know, An = R\r
2\r
n\r
denotes the Cayley Dickson (C-D)-algebras over\r
the real numbers. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3 are known as the clasical C-D algebra\r
which correspond to A0 = R, A1 = C, A2 = H and A3 = ø, Real, Com\u0002plex, Quaternions and Octonions number and because they are normed and\r
alternative algebras they lack of zero divisors.[Sch2] [K-Y].\r
For n ≥ 4, An is no normed, non-alternative (but flexible) algebra and\r
has zero divisors i.e.; there are nonzero elements x and y such that xy = 0.\r
By definition a zero divisor is a nonzero element a such that there exists\r
nonzero b with ab = 0.\r
In [M1] the zero divisors in A4 and the zero divisors in An+1 = An × An\r
with alternative coordinates are described.\r
For n = 4 the set of zero divisors in A4 of fixed norm can be identified\r
with V7,2 the real Stiefel Manifold of two frames in R\r
7\r
and the singular set of\r
(x, y) with xy = 0 and ||x|| = ||y|| = 1 is homoemorphic to G2 the exceptional\r
simple Lie group of rank 2.See also [K-Y].\r
The description of the zero divisors in A4 is given by the known fibration\r
G2\r
π→ V7,2\r
with fiber S\r
3\r
since all the nontrivial annihilators are 4 dimensional.\r
For n ≥ 5 there is NO analogous description. We will show that the zero\r
divisors are in An+1 and V2n−1,2 are related, but they are not equal and the\r
corresponding singular set has (unknown) complicated description. See [M3].\r
In §1 we recall the basic notation and theorems already proved in [M1],\r
[M2] which are necesary for further results.\r
In §2 we study the basic facts of the linear operators left and right muti\u0002plication by a fixed (pure) element, as in [M2], and then, we define a suitable\r
O(2)-action on the double pure elements of An.\r
In §3 we define the Spectrum of a non-zero double pure element looking at\r
the structure of the linear operators defined by left and right multiplication\r
by the element.\r
2

By definition, the Spectrum is a set of (2n−2−1) non negative real numbers\r
attached to each nonzero double pure element in An for n ≥ 3 and the\r
presence of zero in the spectrum determines that the element is a zero divisor.\r
As consequence we see how big can be the annihilator of an element; this\r
result complements very nicely with the recent results in [B-D-I].\r
Also we look at the O(2)-action on the doubly pure elements showing\r
that: the elements in the same O(2)-orbit have the same spectrum and con\u0002sequently the annihilators of the elements in the O(2)-orbit are all equal.\r
In §4 we study the zero divisors and we give new methods to construct\r
many of them, noticing that for n larger than 4 the problem becomes ex\u0002tremely difficult.\r
Also we prove that:All non-zero pure element in An is a component of a\r
zero divisor in An+1\r
In §5 we study the relationship between the Stiefel manifold V2n−1,2 [J]\r
and the set of zero divisors in An+1 noticing that for n larger than 4 they are\r
realted but are ”very far” to be equal.\r
Some of the results of this paper were partially done in a personal manuscript\r
by the author of 2001,(which had restricted circulation) and some also can\r
be found in [Ch].\r
We emphasize the initial input and permanent support to study this\r
subject given by Professor Fred Cohen with whom we are very grateful.\r

1. Basic definitions and lemmas.\r
Here e0 = (e0, 0) is the algebra unit in An−1 × An−1 = An.\r
Definition: e2n−1 = (0, e0) ∈ An−1 × An−1 = An is the sympletic unit and\r
we denote it by ee0 = (0, e0). For\r
a = (a1, a2) ∈ An−1 × An−1 = An\r
ae := (−a2, a1) = (a1, a2)(0, e0) = aee0.\r
is the complexification of a.\r
Because the right multiplication by ee0.\r
Ree0: An → An\r
has the matrix \u0012\r
0 −I\r
I 0\r
\u0013\r
in M2n−1 (R) in the canonical basis.\r
Notice that eae = −a for all a ∈ An; the trace on An is the linear transfor\u0002mation\r
tn : An → A0 = R\r
given by tn(a) = a+a = 2 (Real part of a). For a = (a1, a2) ∈ An−1×An−1 =\r
An\r
tn(a) = tn−1(a1).\r
Definition: An element a is pure in An if\r
tn(a) = tn−1(a1) = 0\r
Notice that a ∈ An is pure if and only if a ⊥ e0 and a ⊥ b if and only if\r
ab = −ba for a and b pure elements in An.\r
Definition: An element a = (a1, a2) ∈ An−1 × An−1 = An is doubly pure if\r
it is pure i.e. tn(a) = 0 and also tn(ae) = −tn−1(a2) = 0.\r
Notice that a is doubly pure if and only if a ∈ {e0, ee0}\r
⊥.\r
Notation: 0An = R\r
2\r
n−1 = {e0}\r
⊥ pure elements in An. Ae\r
n = R\r
2\r
n−2 =\r
{e0, ee0}\r
⊥ doubly pure elements in An.\r
Lemma 1.1. For a and b in Afn we have that\r
4

1) aee0 = ae and ee0a = −ae\r
2) aae = −||a||2ee0 and aae = ||a||2ee0 so a ⊥ ae\r
3) abe = −abf with a pure element.\r
4) a ⊥ b if and only if abe + eba = 0\r
5) ae ⊥ b if and only if ab = ebae\r
6) abe = a\r
eb if and only if a ⊥ b and ae ⊥ b.\r
Proof: Notice that a is pure if a = −a and if a = (a1, a2) is doubly pure\r
then a1 = −a1 and a2 = −a2.\r
1) ee0a = (0, e0)(a1, a2) = (−a2, a1) = (a2, −a1) = −(−a2, a1) = −ae.\r
2) aae = (a1, a2)(−a2, a1) = (−a1a2 + a1a2, a2\r
1 + a\r
2\r
2\r
) = −||a||2ee0\r
aae = (−a2, a1)(a1, a2) = (−a2a1 + a2a1, −a\r
2\r
2 − a\r
2\r
1\r
) = ||a||2ee0.Now since\r
−2ha, a e i = aae + aae = 0 we have a ⊥ ae.\r
3) abe = (−a2, a1)(b1, b2) = (−a2b1 + b2a1, −b2a2 − a1b1). So abef = (a1b1 +\r
b2a2, b2a1 − a2b1) = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = ab then −abe = abe\r
ff = abf.\r
Notice that in this proof we only use that a1 = −a1 i.e a is pure and b\r
doubly pure.\r
4) a ⊥ b ⇔ ab + ba = 0 ⇔ ab = −ba ⇔ abf = −baf\r
⇔ −abe = eba ⇔ abe + eba = 0 by (3).\r
5) ae ⊥ b ⇔ eabe + ebae = 0 (by (4)) ⇔ −ab + ebae = 0.\r
6) If ae ⊥ b and a ⊥ b then\r
abe = −abf = baf = −eba = a\r
eb.\r
Conversly, put a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) in An−1 × An−1 and define\r
c := (a1b1 + b2a2) and d := (b2a1 − a2b1) in An−1.\r
Then a\r
eb = (a1, a2)(−b2, b1) = (−a1b2+b1a2, b1a1+a2b2) so aeb = (−d, c).\r
5

Now ab = (a1, a2)(b1, b2) = (a1b1+b2a2, b2a1−a2b1) = (c, d) then abf = (−d, c)\r
so abe = (d, −c). Suppose that a\r
eb = abe so c = −c and d = −d then\r
tn(ab) = tn−1(c) = c + c = 0 and a ⊥ b\r
tn(abe ) = tn−1(d) = d + d = 0 and ae ⊥ b.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Corollary 1.2 For each a 6= 0 in Ae\r
n. The fourth dimensional vector subspace\r
generated by {e0, a, a, e ee0} is a copy of A2 = H the Hamilton quaternions. We\r
denote it by Ha.\r
Proof: We suppose that ||a|| = 1, otherwise we take a\r
||a||. Construct the\r
following multiplication table\r
e0 a a e ee0\r
e0 e0 a a e ee0\r
ae ae −e0 +ee0 −a\r
a a −ee0 −e0 ae\r
ee0 a ee0 −ae −e0\r
By lemma 1.1. aee0 = ae; ee0a = −ae; aeee0 = eae = −a; ee0ae = −eae = a; aae = −ee0\r
and aae = ee0.\r
This multiplication table is the one of the Hamilton quaternions identi\u0002fying e0 ↔ 1, ae ↔ ˆi, a ↔ ˆj and ee0 ↔ ˆk.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Artin theorem [Sch1] said that: “Any two elements in A3 = O generate\r
an associative subalgebra”.\r
Corollary 1.2 is an analogous to this for An with n ≥ 4.\r

2. Left and Right multiplication.\r
For x and y in An hx, yi denotes the standard Euclidean inner product\r
that in terms of the Cayley-Dickson multiplication is given by\r
tn(xy) = xy + yx = 2hx, yi.\r
In [1] and [8 ] is proved that\r
hax, bi = hx, abi and\r
ha, xbi = hab, xi\r
for all a, b and x in An.\r
Therefore if La and Rb : An → An denotes the linear transformation left\r
and right multiplication by a and b respectively then L\r
T\r
a = La and RT\r
b = Rb\r
.\r
So for a and b pure elements L\r
T\r
a = −La and RTb = −Rb i.e. La and\r
Rb are skew–symmetric linear transformations then (−L\r
2\r
a\r
) and (−R2\r
b\r
) are\r
symmetric definite nonegatives linear transformations.\r
Lemma 2.1 For a a doubly pure element in An, n ≥ 3\r
RaRee0 + Ree0Ra = 0 and LaLee0 + Lee0La = 0.\r
Proof: Using Lemma 1.1 (3).\r
(RaRee0 + Ree0Ra)(x) = (xee0)a + (xa)ee0 = xae + xaf = 0 for x ∈ 0An.\r
If x = re0 for r ∈ R xae + xaf = ree0a + (reg0)a = r(−ae + ae) = 0. Then\r
(RaRee0 + Ree0Ra)(x) = 0 for all x ∈ An.\r
On the other hand we have that for y = (y1, y2)\r
ee0y = (0, e0)(y1, y2) = (−y2\r
, y1)\r
then\r
ee0(ax) = (0, e0)(a1x1 − x2a2, x2a1 + a2x1)\r
= (−(x2a1 + a2x1),(a1x1 − x2a2))\r
= (−(a1x2 + x1a2),(x1a1 − a2x2)) and because a ∈ Afn\r
= (a1x2 + x1a2, −x1a1 + a2x2) for x = (x1, x2) ∈ An\r
7

and a(ee0x) = (a1, a2)(−x2, x1) = (−a1x2−x1a2, x1a1−a2x2) therefore (Lee0\r
La+\r
LaLee0)(x) = ee0(ax) + a(ee0x) = 0 for x ∈ An\r
Q.E.D.\r
Theorem 2.2. For a ∈ An pure element L\r
2\r
a = R2a\r
.\r
Proof: (Case doubly pure). For a ∈ Ae\r
n, An = Ha ⊕ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
so if x ∈ Ha then\r
(because Ha is associative)\r
a(ax) = a\r
2\r
x = −||a||2x = −x||a||2 = xa2 = (xa)a.\r
If x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
then a ⊥ x and by flexibility a(ax) = −a(xa) = −(ax)a = (xa)a\r
so L\r
2\r
a = R2a\r
.\r
(General case). Suppose that a ∈ Ae\r
n and r ∈ R so\r
L\r
2\r
a+ree0\r
= (La + rLee0)\r
2 = L2\r
a + r\r
2L2\r
e20\r
+ r(LaLee0 + Lee0La)\r
R\r
2\r
a+ree0\r
= (Ra + rRee0)\r
2 = R2\r
a + r\r
2R2\r
ee0\r
+ r(RaRee0 + Ree0Ra).\r
By the doubly pure case L\r
2\r
a = R2a\r
, also L\r
2\r
ee0\r
= R2\r
ee0\r
= −I by lemma 2.1\r
LaLee0 + Lee0La = RaRee0 + Ree0Ra = 0 therefore R2\r
a+ree0\r
= L\r
2\r
a+ree0\r
= L\r

Q.E.D.\r
Remark: For 0 6= a pure La and Ra are quite different because the center\r
of An is Re0.\r
Notation: For a and b non–zero pure elements.\r
A = L\r
2\r
a + R\r
2\r
b\r
and S = (a, −, b) = RbLa − LaRb.\r
are linear transformations A, S : An → An.\r
Notice that A is the sum of two symmetric non–positive definite linear\r
transformations so A is also symmetric non–postive definite i.e. L\r
2\r
a ≤ 0 and\r
R2\r
b ≤ 0 implies that A = L\r
2\r
a + R2b ≤ 0 and S = [Rb, La] is skew–symmetric.\r
Theorem 2.3 For a and b (non–zero) pure elements in An\r

i.e. L\r
2\r
(a,b)\r
(x, y) = (A(x) − S(y), A(y) + S(x)).\r
Proof: (By direct calculation).\r
(a, b)[(a, b)(x, y)] = (a, b)(ax − yb, ya + bx)\r
= (a(ax) − a(yb) − (ya + bx)b,(ya + bx)a + b(ax − yb)\r
= (a(ax) − a(yb) + (ay)b − (xb)b,(ya)a + (bx)a − b(xa) − b(by))\r
= (L\r

= (A(x) − (a, y, b), A(y) + (a, x, b))\r
= (A(x) − S(y), A(y) + S(x)).\r
Q.E.D. Corollary 2.4 For r and s real numbers with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and a\r
and b pure elements in An we have that\r
1) L\r
2\r
(ra−sb,sa+rb) = L\r
2\r
(a,b)\r
in particular L\r
2\r
(−b,a) = L\r
2\r
(a,b)\r
2) L\r
2\r
(ra+sb,sa−rb) = L\r
2\r
(b,a)\r
in particular L\r
2\r
(a,−b) = L\r
2\r
(b,a)\r
Proof: 1)\r
L\r
2\r
ra−sb = (rLa − sLb)\r
2 = r2L2\r
a + s\r
2L2\r
b − rs(LaLb + LbLa)\r
L\r
2\r
sa+rb = (sLa + rLb)\r
2 = s2L2\r
a + r\r
2L2\r
b + sr(LaLb + LbLa).\r
Thus L\r
2\r
ra−sb + L\r
2\r
sa+rb = (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
a + (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
b = L\r
2\r
a + R2b\r
:= A.\r
On the other hand for all x ∈ An\r
(ra − sb, x, sa + rb) = (ra, x, sa) + (ra, x, rb) − (sb, x, sa) − (sb, x, rb)\r
= 0 + r\r
2\r
(a, x, b) − s\r
2\r
(b, x, a) − 0\r
= (r\r
2 + s2\r
)(a, x, b)\r
:= S(x)\r
by Theorem 2.2 we are done with 1).\r
To show 2) we observe that A = L\r
2\r
a + R2\r
b = L\r
2\r
b + R2\r
a and\r
S = (a, −, b) = −(b, −a) so L\r
2\r
(b,a) =\r
 \r
A S\r
−S A\r
!\r
and the prove is analogous to case 1).\r

Q.E.D.\r
Corollary 2.5 For α = (a, b) ∈ An × An = An+1 doubly pure we have that:\r
LαLαe + LαeLα = 0\r
and\r
RαRαe + RαeRα = 0.\r
Proof: Suppose that r and s are in R and r\r
2 + s2 = 1 so rα + sαe =\r
r(a, b) + s(−b, a) = (ra − sb, rb + sa) then L\r
2\r
rα+sαe = (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
α by Corollary\r
2.4.\r
On the other hand\r
L\r
2\r
rα+sαe = (rLα + sLαe\r
)\r
2 = r2L2\r
α + s\r
2L2\r
αe + rs(LαLαe + LαeLα)\r
= (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
α because L\r
2\r
α = L\r
2\r
αe\r
.\r
so LαLαe + LαeLα = 0.\r
Similarly RαRαe + RαeRα = 0.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark Notice that Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.5 give us a way to define\r
Cuaternionic Structures on An for n bigher than 2 via alternative elements\r
of norm one, because for such an element a we have also that L\r
2\r
a = R2a = −I.\r
(See [Po]).\r
Now the theory of Schur complement for partitioned matrices ([ Z ] Chap\u0002ter 2 and [H-J]) tell us that.\r
If A is an invertible matrix then\r
det(L\r
2\r
(a,b)\r
) = det (A) det (A + SA\r
−1S)\r
On the other hand A is symmetric definite non–positive i.e. A ≤ 0 be\u0002cause also L\r
2\r
a ≤ 0 and R2\r
b ≤ 0 then −A ≥ 0, −L\r
2\r
a ≥ 0 and −R2\r
b ≥ 0\r
and det(−A) =det(−L\r
2\r
a − R2b\r
) ≥det(−L\r
2\r
a\r
)+det(−R2\r
b\r
) but A, L\r
2\r
a\r
and R2\r
b\r
are\r
matrices of order 2nso det(A) ≥ det(La)\r
2+ det(Rb)2\r
.\r
Therefore if det(A) = 0 then det(La) = 0 and det(Rb) = 0 and A is\r
invertible if, either, La or Rb is invertible.\r
Suposse now that −A > 0. i.e. La or Rb are invertible then −A−1 > 0\r
and since S\r
T = −S. (SA−1S)T = ST\r
(A−1)\r
T ST = SA−1S so SA−1S is\r
10

symmetric and hSA−1S(x), xi = h−A−1S(x), S(x)i ≥ 0 for all x ∈ An,\r
because −A−1 > 0, so (SA−1S) ≥ 0 and (SA−1S)(x) = 0 if and only if\r
S(x) = 0.\r
We resume this discussion in\r
Theorem 2.6 For (a, b) ∈ 0An × 0An = Ae\r
n+1 for n ≥ 3. If La or Rb are\r
invertible and λ = −1 is no an eigenvalue of (A−1S)\r
2\r
then L(a,b)is invertible\r
in An+1.\r
Proof: We already show that La or Rb invertible implies that A is invertible.\r
Now L(a,b)is invertible if and only if L\r
2\r
(a,b)\r
is invertible and, by Schur\r
complement, that happen if and only if det(A + SA−1S) 6= 0 but det(A +\r
SA−1S) = det(A−1) det(I + (A−1S)\r
2\r
) so if λ = −1 is an eigenvalue of\r
(A−1S)\r
2\r
then det(I + (A−1S)\r
2\r
) = 0.\r
Q.E.D.\r
This theorem is useful when A has a simple expression for instance when\r
a and b are alternative elements so A = L\r
2\r
a + R2b = (a\r
2 + b2\r
)I so A−1 =\r
(a\r
2 + b2\r
)\r
−1\r
I and A−1S = (a\r
2 + b2\r
)\r
−1S then L2\r
(a,b)\r
is singular if there exists\r
x 6= 0 in An such that S\r
2\r
(x) = −(a\r
2 + b2\r
)\r
2x. (See [8] § 2).\r

§ 3. The spectrum of a doubly pure element.\r
Let a ∈ An be a doubly pure element with ||a|| 6= 0\r
By the diagonalization theorems of skew–symmetric matrices [Pr] we\r
know that there exists an orthogonal basis with respect to which La has\r
the form\r
diag (∧1, ∧2, ·, ·, ·, ∧k, 0·, ·, ·, 0)\r
where ∧i =\r
 \r
0 −λi\r
λi 0\r
!\r
for λi ≥ 0 in R. So with respect to the same basis\r
L\r
2\r
a has the form\r
diag \u0010−λ\r
2\r
1\r
, −λ\r
2\r
1\r
, ·, ·, ·, −λ\r
2\r
k\r
, −λ\r
2\r
k\r
, 0, 0·, ·, 0, 0\r
\u0011\r
Now, recall that La(Ha) = Ha and La(H\r
⊥\r
a\r
) ⊂ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
.\r
Since Ha is associative we have that\r
L\r
2\r
a\r
|Ha\r
= a\r
2\r
I4×4\r
Therefore the first two λ\r
′\r
s,(i.e. λ1 andλ2) are equal to ||a|| so we restrict\r
ourselves to\r
La, L2\r
a\r
: H\r
⊥\r
a → H\r
⊥\r
a\r
.\r
Define for λ ≥ 0 and a doubly pure with ||a|| = 1\r
Vλ = {x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
|a(ax) = −λ\r
2x}.\r
Theorem 3.1 For 0 6= x ∈ Vλ the set {x,(−1/λ)(ax),(−1/λ)(axf), xe} is an\r
orthogonal set in Vλ for nonzero λ and the dimension of Vλ is congruent with\r
0 mod 4.\r
Proof: If 0 6= x ∈ Vλ then xe ∈ Vλ and a(gax) = −λ\r
2xe. Also\r
a(a((−1/λ)(ax))) = (−1/λ)a(a(ax)) = (−1/λ)(−λ\r
2\r
ax) = −λ\r
2\r
(−1/λ)(ax)\r
and (−1/λ)(ax) ∈ Vλ therefore (−1/λ)(axf) ∈ Vλ and by construction\r
{x,(−1/λ)(ax),(−1/λ)(axf), xe} is an orthonormal set. Now take 0 6= y ∈\r
(Ha ⊕ {x,(1/λ)(ax),(−1/λ)(axf), xe})\r
⊥\r
12

Therefore y is doubly pure and orthogonal to a, a, x, ax, e axf and xe using\r
that L\r
T\r
a = −La we have that:\r
hay, xi = hy, −axi = 0 so ay ⊥ x.\r
hay, axi = hy, −a(ax)i = hy, −(−λ\r
2\r
x)i = λ\r
2\r
hy, xi = 0\r
hay, axfi = hay, −axe i = hae(ay), xi = h−a(gay), xi\r
= ha(ay), xei = hy, a(axe)i = hy, −λ\r
2xei = 0\r
hay, xei = h−ay, x f i = hay, x e i = hy, −axe i = hy, axfi = 0\r
Similarly hy, x e i = h−y, xei = 0;hy, ax e i = hy, −axfi = 0\r
hy, e axfi = hy, axi = 0\r
Finally hay, x f i = h−ay, x e i = hy, axe i = 0 and\r
hay, ax f i = h−ay, ax e i = hy, ae(ax)i = hy, −a(gax)i =\r
= hy, +λ\r
2\r
xei = λ\r
2\r
hy, xei = 0\r
hay, f axfi = hay, axi = 0\r
Therefore for any 0 6= y ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a with y ∈ {x,(−1/λ)ax,(1/λ)x, ax, f xe}\r
⊥ we\r
have that Span{y, y, ay, e ayf} ∩ Span{x,(−1/λ)ax,(−1/λ)ax, f xe} = {0}.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Therefore the eigenvalues of L\r
2\r
a\r
: H\r
⊥\r
a → H\r
⊥\r
a have multiplicity congruent\r
with 0 mod 4 and\r
H\r
⊥\r
a = Vλ1 ⊕ Vλ2 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Vλk\r
k =\r
2\r
n − 4\r

= 2n−2 − 1\r
Definition: The Spectrum of a a non–zero doubly pure element, Spec(a), is\r
the set of (2n−2 − 1) eigenvalues (of multiplicity congruent with 0 mod 4) of\r
−L\r
2\r
a\r
||a||\r
: H\r
⊥\r
a → H\r
⊥\r
a\r
.\r
By definition the elements in Spectra are nonegative real numbers.\r
For instance if a 6= 0 in Af3 then\r
Spec (a) = {1}.\r
13

Recall that a ∈ An is alternative if a(ax) = a\r
2x for all x so for 0 6= a ∈ An\r
alternative.\r
Spec (a) = {1, 1, . . . , 1}.\r
Also La is non–singular if and only if 0 6∈ Spec(a).\r
Example: Take e1 and e2 basic elements in A3.\r
Define a = (e1, e2) ∈ A4 so ||a|| =\r
√\r
2 and\r
(e1, e2)(−e4, e7) = (−e1e4 + e7e2, e7e1 + e2e4) = (−e5 + e5, −e6 + e6)\r
= (0, 0)\r
so 0 ∈ Spec(a) and L(e1,e2)is non–invertible.\r
Also\r
(e1, e2)(e2, e1) = (2e1e2, 0) and\r
L\r
2\r
(e1,e2)\r
(e2, e1) = 2(e1(e1e2), e2(e2, e1)) = −2(e2, e1).\r
and 1 ∈ Spec(a).\r
The spectrum of a has three elements we already calculate two {0, 1}.\r
Consider\r
(e1, e2)(e7, −e4) = (e1e7 − e4e2, −e4e1 − e2e7)\r
= (e6 + e6, e5 + e5)\r
= (2e6, 2e5).\r
so\r
L\r
2\r
(e1,e2)\r
(e7, −e4) = 2(e1, e2)(e6, e5)\r
= 2[(e1e6 + e5e2, e5e1 − e2e6)]\r
= 2[(−e7 − e7, e4 + e4)]\r
= 2[(−2e7.2e4)]\r
= −4(e7, −e4).\r
Since |(e1, e2)| =\r
√\r
2 then L\r
2\r
a\r
||a||\r
= ( √\r
1\r
2\r
)\r
2L2\r
(e1,e2)\r
so\r
−\r
1\r
2\r
L\r
2\r
(e1,e2)\r
(e7, −e4) = 1\r
2\r
(4)(e7, −e4) = 2(e7, −e4)\r
14

so Spec((e1, e2)) = {0, 1, 2}.\r
Remarks: We can generalize the argument in last example in the following\r
way:\r
Suppose that a and b are alternative elements in 0An n ≥ 3 such that\r
|a| = |b| 6= 0 and a orthogonal to b then\r
(i) 1 ∈ Spec((a, b)) in An+1.\r
(ii) If also (a, b)(x, y) = (0, 0) for some x and y in 0An then 2 ∈ Spec((a, b))\r
realized by (y, x) and therefore {0, 1, 2} ⊂ Spec((a, b)).\r
It seems to us that (ii) is an expresion of a”Mirror Symmetry” sourrended\r
by the zero divisors in An+1:\r
”If (x, y) left 0 in the spectrum of (a, b) then (y, x) leaves 2 in the spectrum\r
of (a, b).\r
”If (x, y) left 1 in the spectrum of (a, b) then (y, x) leaves 1 in the spectrum\r
of (a, b).\r
This ”Mirror Symmetry” is ”Broken” in the Singular set defined by The\r
zero set of the Hopf map (see [M3])\r
{(x, y)|xy = 0, ||x|| = ||y|| = 1}\r
Because (x, y)(y, x) = (2xy, ||y||2−||x||2) for x and y pure non zero elements\r
in An, ”The Hopf construction map” in terms of the algebra An+1.\r
Remark: For r and s in R with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and (a, b) doubly pure in\r
An+1\r
φ(a, b) = (ra ∓ sb, sa ± rb)\r
This define an O(2)-action on Ae\r
n+1 and by Corollary 2.4 we have that\r
Spec(φ(a, b)) = Spec((a, b))\r
Now we ”measure” the lack of the Normed property in An in terms of Spectra.\r
Definition: An element 0 6= a ∈ 0An (i.e. a is pure) is normed with\r
x ∈ An if ||a||||x|| = ||ax||. We also define that a is normed if ||ax|| = ||a||||x||\r
for all x ∈ An.\r
Theorem 3.2 0 6= a ∈ 0An is normed if and only if a is alternative i.e.\r
15

a(ax) = a\r
2x for all x in An.\r
Proof: Suppose that 0 6= a ∈ 0An is alternative so\r
||a||2||x||2 = −a\r
2\r
hx, xi = h−a\r
2x, xi = h−a(ax), xi = hax, axi\r
= ||ax||2for all x ∈ An.\r
Conversly suppose that ||ax|| = ||a||||x|| for all x ∈ An then h−a\r
2x, xi =\r
hax, axi = h−a(ax), xi and ha\r
2x − a(ax), xi = 0 for all x ∈ An.\r
But (a\r
2\r
I−L\r
2\r
a\r
) is a symmetric linear transformation then all its eigenvalues\r
are of the form h(a\r
2\r
I − L\r
2\r
a\r
)(x), xi so a\r
2\r
I − L\r
2\r
a = 0.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: Notice that the properties for an element of being normed and al\u0002ternative coincide globally but no locally i.e. we say that a ∈ 0An alternate\r
with x for x ∈ An if a(ax) = a\r
2x so a ∈ 0An is an alternative element if a\r
alternates with any element in An (see[M2]).\r
Now if a alternate with x then a is normed with x : ||ax||2 = hax, axi =\r
h−a(ax), xi = h−a\r
2x, xi = ||a||2\r
· ||x||.\r
But the converse is no necessarily true.\r
Example: Take a = e1, b = e2 and ee0 = e4 in A3. Define α = (e1, e2) and\r
ε = (ee0, 0) in A3 × A3 = A4. Since ε is alternative element in A4 we have\r
that ||αε||2 = hαε, αεi = h−(αε)ε, αi = h−αε2, αi = ||α||2||ε||2 = ||α||2 and\r
α is normed with ε.\r
On the other hand using th.2.3\r
L\r
2\r
α\r
(ε) = ((L\r
2\r
e1 + R\r
2\r
e2\r
)(ee0) − 0, 0 + (e1, ee0, e2))\r
= ((−2I)(e4),(e1e4)e2 − e1(e4e2))\r
= (−2e4, e5e2 − e1(−e6))\r
= (−2e4, −e7 − e7)\r
= (−2e4, −2e7)\r
= −2ε − 2e15 in A4.\r
But α\r
2\r
ε = −2ε so (α, α, ε) = α\r
2\r
ε − L\r
2\r
α\r
(ε) = 2e15 and α does not alternate\r
with ε.\r
Proposition 3.3 For a ∈ Ae\r
n with a 6= 0 and λ ∈ Spec(a).\r
Suppose that 0 6= x ∈ Vλ ⊂ H\r
⊥\r
a ⊂ Ae\r
n then\r
16

(1)||ax|| = λ||a||||x||.\r
(2) If x is an alternative element then λ = 1.\r
Proof: (1) Assuming that ||a|| = 1 we have that\r
a(ax) = −λ\r
2x.\r
so\r
||ax||2 = hax, axi = −ha(ax), xi = hλ\r
2x, xi = λ2\r
||x||2\r
.\r
Therefore in general we have that\r
||ax|| = λ||ax||\r
.\r
If 0 6= x is an alternative element then ||yx|| = ||y||||x|| for all y (th\r
3.2).Thus if x ∈ Vλ, then by (1), λ = 1, and we are done with (2).\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark There are elements 0 6= a ∈ Ae\r
n with 1 ∈ Spec(a) and a non–\r
alternative (See example above).\r
Moreover now we prove that for each nonzero a ∈ Ae\r
n,\r
1 ∈ Spec (a)\r
For this we need:\r
Lemma 3.4 For a 6= 0 in Ae\r
n n ≥ 4 there exists x 6= 0 in H\r
⊥\r
a\r
such that\r
||ax|| = ||a||||x||.\r
Proof: Recall that if 0 6= y ∈ An is alternative then ||ay|| = ||a||||y||. (th\r
3.2).Thus If 0 6= y ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
for some y alternative we are done.\r
On the other hand by dimensional reasons (recall dim Ha = 4 and any\r
canonical basic element is alternative) no all alternative element belongs to\r
Ha so there exists 0 6= y ∈ An alternative element with y = (y1 + y2) ∈\r
Ha ⊕ H\r
⊥\r
a and y2 6= 0 in H\r
⊥\r
a\r
.\r
But ||ay|| = ||a||||y|| implies that\r
hay, ayi = ha, aihy, yi\r
17

But\r
hay, ayi = ha(y1 + y2), a(y1 + y2)i\r
= hay1 + ay2, ay1 + ay2i\r
= hay1, ay1i + hay2, ay2i + 2hay1, ay2i\r
But hay1, ay2i = −ha(ay1), y2i = −ha\r
2\r
y1, y2i = 0 and hay1, ay1i = ha, aihy1, y1i =\r
||a||2||y1||2 because y1 ∈ Ha wich is associative and y2 ⊥ y1; therefore\r
hay, ayi = ha, aihy1, y1i + hay2, ay2i and\r
ha, aihy, yi = ha, aihy1 + y2, y1 + y2i\r
= ha, aihy1, y1i + ha, aihy2, y2i\r
because y1 ⊥ y2.\r
Cancelling out we have ha, aihy2, y2i = hay2, ay2i and ||a||||y2|| = ||ay2||\r
for y2 6= 0 in H\r
⊥\r
a\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: We can also use the construction of bilinear maps as in Adem\r
(see [A],[L] and [Sh]) to prove this lemma because any non–zero double pure\r
element belongs to a alternative subalgebra of An with normed product (see\r
[M2]).\r
Theorem 3.5 For 0 6= a ∈ An n ≥ 3 with a doubly pure\r
1 ∈ Spec(a).\r
Proof: Suppose that 1 6∈ Spec(a) then a(ax) 6= a\r
2x for all (non-zero) x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
then a(ax) − a\r
2x 6= 0 for all (non-zero) x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
. Now L\r
2\r
a\r
(Ha) ⊂ Ha and\r
L\r
2\r
a\r
(H\r
⊥\r
a\r
) ⊂ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
so we have that L\r
2\r
a\r
|H⊥\r
a\r
and (L\r
2\r
a − a\r
2\r
I)|H⊥\r
a\r
are symmetric\r
linear transformations.\r
Therefore ha(ax) − a\r
2x, xi 6= 0 for all non-zero x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a and hax, axi 6=\r
|a|\r
2\r
hx, xi and ||ax|| 6= ||a||||x|| for all non-zero x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a which contradicts the\r
previous lemma 3.4.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Corollary 3.6 For a nonzero element in An n ≥ 3 we have that:\r
dimKer(a\r
2\r
I − L\r
2\r
a\r
) ≥ 8.\r
18

Proof. Since any associator vanish when one of the entries is real,the\r
question can be reduced to the case a is a pure element.\r
On the other hand by Corollary 1.5 in [M2] is known that for b double\r
pure element\r
(b, ee0, x) + (ee0, b, x) = 0\r
for all x in An.\r
Recalling that ee0 is an alternative element, we can reduce the question to\r
tha case a double pure element,so by Theorem 3.5. dimVλ ≥ 4 for λ = 1 and\r
dim(Ha ⊕ V1) ≥ 8\r

§ 4. The zero divisors in An n ≥ 4.\r
In this section 0 6= a = (a1, a2) ∈ An−1 × An−1 = An and n ≥ 4\r
Definition: a is zero divisor if there exists x 6= 0 in An such that ax = 0 i.e.\r
Ker La 6= {0}.\r
Since ||ax|| = ||xa|| for all x in An (see [M1]) we have that ax = 0 if and\r
only if xa = 0 so left and right zero divisors concide.\r
Also ||ax|| = ||ax|| (see [M1]) then if x 6= 0 tn(a)x = (a+a)x = ax+ax =\r
0 if ax = 0; but tn(a) is real number so ax = 0 ⇒ tn(a) = 0 so any zero\r
divisor is a pure element.\r
Actually\r
Lemma 4.1 Any zero divisor in An is double pure.\r
Proof: By Corollary 2.4 for a ∈ 0An\r
Ker La = Ker L\r
2\r
a = Ker L\r
2\r
ea = Ker Lea\r
If {0} 6= KerLa then {0} 6= Ker Leaand ae = (−a2, a1) is a zero divisor so ae is\r
pure in An and a2 is pure in An−1 then a is doubly pure.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Notice that ax = 0 if and only if ||a||−1ax = 0 so being a zero divisor\r
is independent of the norm. On the other hand by Corollay 2.4(1) if a is\r
a zero divisor and r and s in R with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 then L2\r
a = L\r
2\r
(a1,a2) =\r
L\r
2\r
(ra1−sa2,sa1+ra2) = L\r
2\r
ra+sea\r
then (ra + sae) is a zero divisor (in particular ae is\r
a zero divisor) and for any b 6= 0 in Ha doubly pure we have that b is a zero\r
divisor and KerLa = KerLb. Because\r
L\r
2\r
ra+sea = r\r
2L2\r
a + s\r
2Lea + rs(LaLea + LeaLa)\r
= (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
ea + 0 (Corollary 2.5)\r
= L\r
2\r
a\r
.\r
So if ||a|| = 1 then b = ra + sae with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and Ker La = KerLb.\r
Lemma 4.2 Let a = (a1, a2) be in An−1 × An−1 = An with a 6= 0 .a is a\r
zero divisor if and only if ˆa := (a2, a1) is a zero divisor. Moreover ax = 0 if\r
20

and only if ˆaxˆ = 0.\r
Proof: Put x = (x1, x2) so ˆx = (x2, x1) in 0An−1× 0An−1 calculating we have:\r
ax = (a1, a2)(x1, x2) = (a1x1 + x2a2, x2a1 − a2x1) := (c, d)\r
aˆxˆ = (a2, a1)(x2, x1) = (a2x2 + x1a1, x1a2 − a1x2) = (c, −d)\r
therefore c = d = 0 in An−1 if and only if ax = ˆaxˆ = 0.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: Notice that lemma 4.1 said KerLa = KerLea(equality) while lemma\r
4.2 said that KerLa\r
∼= KerLaˆ (isomorphism), induced by\r
0An−1 ×0An−1\r
∧\r
→ 0An × 0An\r
given by (x1, x2) 7→ (x2, x1) which is a one–to one correspondence.\r
Now 0 6= a ∈ An is a zero divisor if and only if ra is a zero divisor for all\r
r ∈ R, r 6= 0 so we restrict ourselves to the study of zero divisor of norm one.\r
Using lemma 1.1 in §1 we can construct zero divisors in the following way:\r
Proposition 4.3. For 0 6= a ∈ An, n ≥ 3, and a doubly pure we have:\r
1) If b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a and |a| = |b| 6= 0 then (a, b) is a zero divisor in An+1.\r
2) (a, ae) and (a, −ae) are zero divisors in An+1.\r
Proof:\r
1) For b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a with |a| = |b| 6= 0 we have that (a, b)(a, e\r
eb) = (aae −\r
ebb, eba + bae) = (aae + ebb, eba − bae) in An+1. By lemma 1.1. (2) aae + ebb =\r
−||a||2ee0 + ||b||2ee0 = 0 in An. By lemma 1.1. (6) eba = bae because\r
b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
in An.\r
2) Since n ≥ 3, H\r
⊥\r
a\r
6= {0}. Taking 0 6= x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a ⊂ An\r
(a, ae)(x, −xe) = (ax − xea, e −xae − axe ) in An+1.\r
By lemma 1.1. (5) ax = xeae and by lemma 1.1 (3) −xae −axe = xaf +axf =\r
xag+ ax = 0 because a ⊥ x.\r
Similarly\r
(a, −ae)(x, xe) = (ax − xea, e xae + axe ) = (0, 0) in An+1\r
Q.E.D.\r
21

Remark: Notice that this proposition is telling us that any non–zero doubly\r
pure element in An (n ≥ 3) is the component of a zero divisor in An+1.\r
We will prove that this is true also for non–zero pure elements in An.\r
Theorem 4.4. For 0 6= a ∈ An, (n ≥ 3) a doubly pure element of norm one\r
and 0 6= λ ∈ Spec(a) we have that (a, ±λee0) are zero divisors in An+1.\r
Proof: By definition of the spectrum of a\r
a(ax) = −λ\r
2x for some 0 6= x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
Then in An+1\r
(a, λee0)(ax, −λxe) = (a(ax) − λ\r
2xeee0, −λxae + λee0(ax))\r
= (−λ\r
2x − λ2ex, λ e (xaf) − λ(xaf))\r
= (0, 0)\r
Similarly\r
(a, −λee0)(ax, λxe) = (a(ax) + λ\r
2xeee0, λxae − λee0(ax))\r
= (−λ\r
2x − λ2ex, e −λxaf + λ(xaf)\r
= (0, 0).\r
Notice also that (a, ±λee0)(−1/λax, ±xe) = (0, 0).\r
Q.E.D.\r
From this we derive the important:\r
Corollary 4.5 For 0 6= α ∈ An (n ≥ 3) with |α| = 1 and α pure element\r
there exists β in An with α ⊥ β and |α| = |β| = 1 such that (α, β) is a zero\r
divisor in An+1.\r
Proof: If α is doubly pure we are done by Proposition 4.3. Suppose that α is\r
pure element (no double pure) then there exist a ∈ An doubly pure element\r
and r and s real numbers with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and s 6= 0 such that α = ra + see0\r
and |a| = |α| = 1.\r
By Corollary 2.4 (1) L\r
2\r
(a,−ee0) = L\r
2\r
(ra+see0,sa−ree0)\r
. Therefore making β =\r
sa − ree0 we have that\r
L\r
2\r
(a,−ee0) = L\r
2\r
(α,β)\r
22

Now by theorem 3.5 λ = 1 ∈ Spec(a) and by theorem 4.4 (a, −ee0) is a zero\r
divisor in An+1 so (α, β) is a zero divisor in An+1.\r
By construction |α| = |β| = 1 and α ⊥ β.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Example: We know that 2 is in Spec((e1, e2)) in A4 so if a = (√2)−1\r
(e1, e2)\r
and ee0 = e8 in A4,according with Theorem 4.4 we have that\r
(a, 2e8) = √\r
2\r
−1\r
(e1 + e10) + 2e16\r
is a zero divisor in A5.\r
Remarks: Notice that, in contrast, with the case n = 4 where the zero\r
divisors must have coordinates in A3 of equal norm (see [M1]) this is no the\r
case for A5.(Besides the ”trivial” cases when one of the coordinates is a zero\r
divisor and the other is equal to 0 in A4.)\r
Therefore the zero divisors in A5 are ”very far” to be described as in A4\r
where they can be identified with V7,2 the Stiefel Manifold of 2 frames in R\r
7\r
.\r
But also, Corollary 4.5 is telling us that the set of zero divisors in An+1\r
has some subset wich can be describe in terms of the Stiefel Manifold V2n−1,2.\r
for n ≥ 3.\r

ha, bi + hb, ai so α ⊥ αˆ in Ae\r
n+1 if and only if a ⊥ b in 0An.\r
Also by lemma 5.1 hα, e αˆi = h(−b, a),(b, a)i = −||b||2 + ||a||2so αe ⊥ αˆ in\r
Ae\r
n+1 if and only if ||a|| = ||b|| 6= 0.\r

Theorem 5.3 The set of non–trivial elements in Ae\r
n+1 with entries of norm\r
1 is the complex Stiefel manifold Wm,2 for m = 2n−1 − 1.[J].\r
Proof: Define Hn : Ae\r
n × Aen → C = complex numbers, by Hn(x, y) =\r
2hx, yi − 2ihx, y e i.\r
Claim: Hn define a Hermitian inner product in Ae\r
n.\r
24

Clearly Hn is R–bilinear and\r
Hn(x, y) = 2hx, yi + 2ihx, y e i = 2hx, yi − 2ihy, x e i\r
= Hn(y, x).\r
Also\r
Hn(x, y e ) = 2hx, y e i − 2ih\r
ex, y e i = 2hx, y e i + 2ihx, yi\r
= 2ihx, yi − 2i\r
2\r
hx, y e i = iHn(x, y)\r
Therefore Hn define a Hermitian product as claimed.\r
By definition Hn(a, b) = 0 if and only if b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
and\r
Wm,2 = {(a, b) ∈ Ae\r
n × Aen|Hn(a, b) = 0 and ||a|| = ||b|| = 1}\r
for\r
m =\r
1\r
2\r
(2n − 2) = 2n−1 − 1\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark Notice that the set of Stiefel elements in Ae\r
n+1, with entries of norm\r
one, in 0An can be seen as the real Stiefel manifold V2n−1,2 i.e.\r
V2n−1,2 = {(a, b) ∈ 0An × 0An|a ⊥ b and |a| = |b| = 1}\r
Now we give a partial answer to the following:\r
Question: Is any Stiefel element in Ae\r
n+1 a zero divisor?.\r
Partial Answer: So far, we have seen that the following types of Stiefel\r
elements are zero divisors.\r
Suppose that α = (a, b) ∈ Ae\r
n+1 with a ∈ 0An, b ∈ 0An and |a| = |b| 6= 0\r
with a ⊥ b.\r
Case: a and b doubly pure in An.\r
1. If α = (a, b) ∈ Ae\r
n × Aen is a non–trivial then b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a and by §4\r
(a, b)(a, e\r
eb) = (0, 0) in An+1.\r
2. Suppose that b ∈ Ha .\r
Since |a| = |b| 6= 0 b = ra + sae for r\r
2 + s2 = 1, and a ⊥ b implies that\r
0 = ha, bi = ha, rai + ha, saei,but a ⊥ ae and we have that 0 = rha, ai =\r
r||a||2, therefore r = 0 and b = sae with s\r
2 = 1 i.e. b = ±ae.\r
25

In § 4 we show that (a, ±ae)(x, ∓xe) = (0, 0) in An+1 for all 0 6= x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
, so\r
(a, b) is a zero divisor.\r
General case: a and b pure elements in An.\r
In § 4 we prove that for any non–zero doubly pure element c in Ae\r
n (c, ee0)\r
is a zero divisor in An+1.\r
Since any pure element a ∈ 0An with a 6= 0 is of the form a = rc ∓ see0\r
for r, s in R with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and |a| = |c| 6= 0 for some c doubly pure in Ae\r
n\r
then (rc ∓ see0, sc ± ree0) is a zero divisor so (a, b) is a zero divisor in An+1 for\r
a ∈ 0An a 6= 0 and b = sc ± ree0 if a = rc ∓ see0.\r
More generally if 0 6= λ ∈ Spec(c) then (c, λee0) is a zero divisor in An+1\r
for c a doubly pure element in Ae\r
n with c 6= 0 (§4). If a = rc ∓ sλee0 with r\r
and s in R such that\r
r\r
2 + (sλ)2 = 1\r
then (a, b) is a zero divisor for b = (sλ)c ± ree0.\r
Open Question:\r
Given a ∈ 0An with a 6= 0.\r
If b ∈ 0An with b ⊥ a, |b| = |a| 6= 0 then\r
Is b of one the forms described above?\r
Remark.Notice that if λ = 0 is in Spec(c) then c is a zero divisor and\r
a = rc ∓ sλee0 = rc with r\r
2 = 1 so a = ±c and b = ∓ee0 and (a, b) is a zero\r
divisor.\r

In this paper we return to the subject of 97’ authors paper [M1] about\r
the description of the zero divisors in the Cayley-Dickson algebras over the\r
real numbers.\r
This paper must be seen as a sequel of the papers [M1] and [M2] and\r
related to papers [M3] and [M4].\r
As we know, An = R\r
2\r
n\r
denotes the Cayley Dickson (C-D)-algebras over\r
the real numbers. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3 are known as the clasical C-D algebra\r
which correspond to A0 = R, A1 = C, A2 = H and A3 = ø, Real, Com\u0002plex, Quaternions and Octonions number and because they are normed and\r
alternative algebras they lack of zero divisors.[Sch2] [K-Y].\r
For n ≥ 4, An is no normed, non-alternative (but flexible) algebra and\r
has zero divisors i.e.; there are nonzero elements x and y such that xy = 0.\r
By definition a zero divisor is a nonzero element a such that there exists\r
nonzero b with ab = 0.\r
In [M1] the zero divisors in A4 and the zero divisors in An+1 = An × An\r
with alternative coordinates are described.\r
For n = 4 the set of zero divisors in A4 of fixed norm can be identified\r
with V7,2 the real Stiefel Manifold of two frames in R\r
7\r
and the singular set of\r
(x, y) with xy = 0 and ||x|| = ||y|| = 1 is homoemorphic to G2 the exceptional\r
simple Lie group of rank 2.See also [K-Y].\r
The description of the zero divisors in A4 is given by the known fibration\r
G2\r
π→ V7,2\r
with fiber S\r
3\r
since all the nontrivial annihilators are 4 dimensional.\r
For n ≥ 5 there is NO analogous description. We will show that the zero\r
divisors are in An+1 and V2n−1,2 are related, but they are not equal and the\r
corresponding singular set has (unknown) complicated description. See [M3].\r
In §1 we recall the basic notation and theorems already proved in [M1],\r
[M2] which are necesary for further results.\r
In §2 we study the basic facts of the linear operators left and right muti\u0002plication by a fixed (pure) element, as in [M2], and then, we define a suitable\r
O(2)-action on the double pure elements of An.\r
In §3 we define the Spectrum of a non-zero double pure element looking at\r
the structure of the linear operators defined by left and right multiplication\r
by the element."""

attached to each nonzero double pure element in An for n ≥ 3 and the\r
presence of zero in the spectrum determines that the element is a zero divisor.\r
As consequence we see how big can be the annihilator of an element; this\r
result complements very nicely with the recent results in [B-D-I].\r
Also we look at the O(2)-action on the doubly pure elements showing\r
that: the elements in the same O(2)-orbit have the same spectrum and con\u0002sequently the annihilators of the elements in the O(2)-orbit are all equal.\r
In §4 we study the zero divisors and we give new methods to construct\r
many of them, noticing that for n larger than 4 the problem becomes ex\u0002tremely difficult.\r
Also we prove that:All non-zero pure element in An is a component of a\r
zero divisor in An+1\r
In §5 we study the relationship between the Stiefel manifold V2n−1,2 [J]\r
and the set of zero divisors in An+1 noticing that for n larger than 4 they are\r
realted but are ”very far” to be equal.\r
Some of the results of this paper were partially done in a personal manuscript\r
by the author of 2001,(which had restricted circulation) and some also can\r
be found in [Ch].\r
We emphasize the initial input and permanent support to study this\r
subject given by Professor Fred Cohen with whom we are very grateful.\r

For x and y in An hx, yi denotes the standard Euclidean inner product\r

Remarks: We can generalize the argument in last example in the following\r
way:\r
Suppose that a and b are alternative elements in 0An n ≥ 3 such that\r
|a| = |b| 6= 0 and a orthogonal to b then\r
(i) 1 ∈ Spec((a, b)) in An+1.\r
(ii) If also (a, b)(x, y) = (0, 0) for some x and y in 0An then 2 ∈ Spec((a, b))\r
realized by (y, x) and therefore {0, 1, 2} ⊂ Spec((a, b)).\r
It seems to us that (ii) is an expresion of a”Mirror Symmetry” sourrended\r
by the zero divisors in An+1:\r
”If (x, y) left 0 in the spectrum of (a, b) then (y, x) leaves 2 in the spectrum\r
of (a, b).\r
”If (x, y) left 1 in the spectrum of (a, b) then (y, x) leaves 1 in the spectrum\r
of (a, b).\r
This ”Mirror Symmetry” is ”Broken” in the Singular set defined by The\r
zero set of the Hopf map (see [M3])\r
{(x, y)|xy = 0, ||x|| = ||y|| = 1}\r
Because (x, y)(y, x) = (2xy, ||y||2−||x||2) for x and y pure non zero elements\r
in An, ”The Hopf construction map” in terms of the algebra An+1.\r
Remark: For r and s in R with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and (a, b) doubly pure in\r
An+1\r
φ(a, b) = (ra ∓ sb, sa ± rb)\r
This define an O(2)-action on Ae\r
n+1 and by Corollary 2.4 we have that\r
Spec(φ(a, b)) = Spec((a, b))\r
Now we ”measure” the lack of the Normed property in An in terms of Spectra.\r
Definition: An element 0 6= a ∈ 0An (i.e. a is pure) is normed with\r
x ∈ An if ||a||||x|| = ||ax||. We also define that a is normed if ||ax|| = ||a||||x||\r

But the converse is no necessarily true.\r
Example: Take a = e1, b = e2 and ee0 = e4 in A3. Define α = (e1, e2) and\r

Since ||ax|| = ||xa|| for all x in An (see [M1]) we have that ax = 0 if and\r
only if xa = 0 so left and right zero divisors concide.\r
Also ||ax|| = ||ax|| (see [M1]) then if x 6= 0 tn(a)x = (a+a)x = ax+ax =\r
0 if ax = 0; but tn(a) is real number so ax = 0 ⇒ tn(a) = 0 so any zero\r
divisor is a pure element.\r

ea = Ker Lea\r

(a1,a2) =\r
L\r
2\r
(ra1−sa2,sa1+ra2) = L\r
2\r
ra+sea\r
then (ra + sae) is a zero divisor (in particular ae is\r
a zero divisor) and for any b 6= 0 in Ha doubly pure we have that b is a zero\r
divisor and KerLa = KerLb. Because\r
L\r
2\r
ra+sea = r\r
2L2\r
a + s\r
2Lea + rs(LaLea + LeaLa)\r
= (r\r
2 + s2\r
)L\r
2\r
ea + 0 (Corollary 2.5)\r
= L\r
2\r
a\r
.\r
So if ||a|| = 1 then b = ra + sae with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and Ker La = KerLb.\r
Lemma 4.2 Let a = (a1, a2) be in An−1 × An−1 = An with a 6= 0 .a is a\r
zero divisor if and only if ˆa := (a2, a1) is a zero divisor. Moreover ax = 0 if\r
20

and only if ˆaxˆ = 0.\r
Proof: Put x = (x1, x2) so ˆx = (x2, x1) in 0An−1× 0An−1 calculating we have:\r
ax = (a1, a2)(x1, x2) = (a1x1 + x2a2, x2a1 − a2x1) := (c, d)\r
aˆxˆ = (a2, a1)(x2, x1) = (a2x2 + x1a1, x1a2 − a1x2) = (c, −d)\r
therefore c = d = 0 in An−1 if and only if ax = ˆaxˆ = 0.\r
Q.E.D.\r
Remark: Notice that lemma 4.1 said KerLa = KerLea(equality) while lemma\r
4.2 said that KerLa\r
∼= KerLaˆ (isomorphism), induced by\r
0An−1 ×0An−1\r
∧\r
→ 0An × 0An\r
given by (x1, x2) 7→ (x2, x1) which is a one–to one correspondence.\r
Now 0 6= a ∈ An is a zero divisor if and only if ra is a zero divisor for all\r
r ∈ R, r 6= 0 so we restrict ourselves to the study of zero divisor of norm one.\r
Using lemma 1.1 in §1 we can construct zero divisors in the following way:\r
Proposition 4.3. For 0 6= a ∈ An, n ≥ 3, and a doubly pure we have:\r
1) If b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a and |a| = |b| 6= 0 then (a, b) is a zero divisor in An+1.\r
2) (a, ae) and (a, −ae) are zero divisors in An+1.\r
Proof:\r
1) For b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a with |a| = |b| 6= 0 we have that (a, b)(a, e\r
eb) = (aae −\r
ebb, eba + bae) = (aae + ebb, eba − bae) in An+1. By lemma 1.1. (2) aae + ebb =\r
−||a||2ee0 + ||b||2ee0 = 0 in An. By lemma 1.1. (6) eba = bae because\r
b ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a\r
in An.\r
2) Since n ≥ 3, H\r
⊥\r
a\r
6= {0}. Taking 0 6= x ∈ H\r
⊥\r
a ⊂ An\r
(a, ae)(x, −xe) = (ax − xea, e −xae − axe ) in An+1.\r
By lemma 1.1. (5) ax = xeae and by lemma 1.1 (3) −xae −axe = xaf +axf =\r
xag+ ax = 0 because a ⊥ x.\r
Similarly\r
(a, −ae)(x, xe) = (ax − xea, e xae + axe ) = (0, 0) in An+1\r

Theorem 4.4. For 0 6= a ∈ An, (n ≥ 3) a doubly pure element of norm one\r

From this we derive the important:\r
Corollary 4.5 For 0 6= α ∈ An (n ≥ 3) with |α| = 1 and α pure element\r
there exists β in An with α ⊥ β and |α| = |β| = 1 such that (α, β) is a zero\r

Proof: If α is doubly pure we are done by Proposition 4.3. Suppose that α is\r
pure element (no double pure) then there exist a ∈ An doubly pure element\r
and r and s real numbers with r\r
2 + s2 = 1 and s 6= 0 such that α = ra + see0\r

Clearly any non–trivial element in Ae\r
n+1 is a Stiefel element in Aen+1.\r
Lemma 5.1. If α = (a, b) and χ = (x, y) are in 0An × 0An = Ae\r

hα, χi = ha, xi + hb, yi\r

Proof: Recall that if α = (a, b) then ˆα = (b, a). By lemma 5.1 hα, αˆi =\r

General case: a and b pure elements in An.\r
In § 4 we prove that for any non–zero doubly pure element c in Ae\r

Since any pure element a ∈ 0An with a 6= 0 is of the form a = rc ∓ see0\r

More generally if 0 6= λ ∈ Spec(c) then (c, λee0) is a zero divisor in An+1\r
