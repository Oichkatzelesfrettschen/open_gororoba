Abstract\r
The octonions are the largest of the four normed division algebras. While somewhat neglected\r
due to their nonassociativity, they stand at the crossroads of many interesting fields of mathe\u0002matics. Here we describe them and their relation to Clifford algebras and spinors, Bott period\u0002icity, projective and Lorentzian geometry, Jordan algebras, and the exceptional Lie groups. We\r
also touch upon their applications in quantum logic, special relativity and supersymmetry.\r
1 Introduction\r
There are exactly four normed division algebras: the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C),\r
quaternions (H), and octonions (O). The real numbers are the dependable breadwinner of the\r
family, the complete ordered field we all rely on. The complex numbers are a slightly flashier but\r
still respectable younger brother: not ordered, but algebraically complete. The quaternions, being\r
noncommutative, are the eccentric cousin who is shunned at important family gatherings. But the\r
octonions are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic: they are nonassociative.\r
Most mathematicians have heard the story of how Hamilton invented the quaternions. In 1835, at\r
the age of 30, he had discovered how to treat complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. Fascinated\r
by the relation between C and 2-dimensional geometry, he tried for many years to invent a bigger\r
algebra that would play a similar role in 3-dimensional geometry. In modern language, it seems he\r
was looking for a 3-dimensional normed division algebra. His quest built to its climax in October\r
1843. He later wrote to his son, “Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month, on my\r
coming down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used to ask me:\r
‘Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?’ Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of\r
the head: ‘No, I can only add and subtract them’.” The problem, of course, was that there exists\r
no 3-dimensional normed division algebra. He really needed a 4-dimensional algebra.\r
Finally, on the 16th of October, 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal to a\r
meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, he made his momentous discovery. “That is to say,\r
I then and there felt the galvanic circuit of thought close; and the sparks which fell from it were the\r
fundamental equations between i, j, k; exactly such as I have used them ever since.” And in a famous\r
act of mathematical vandalism, he carved these equations into the stone of the Brougham Bridge:\r
i\r
2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1.\r
One reason this story is so well-known is that Hamilton spent the rest of his life obsessed with\r
the quaternions and their applications to geometry [45, 53]. And for a while, quaternions were\r
fashionable. They were made a mandatory examination topic in Dublin, and in some American\r
universities they were the only advanced mathematics taught. Much of what we now do with scalars\r
and vectors in R\r
3 was then done using real and imaginary quaternions. A school of ‘quaternionists’\r
developed, which was led after Hamilton’s death by Peter Tait of Edinburgh and Benjamin Peirce of\r
Harvard. Tait wrote 8 books on the quaternions, emphasizing their applications to physics. When\r
Gibbs invented the modern notation for the dot product and cross product, Tait condemned it as a\r
“hermaphrodite monstrosity”. A war of polemics ensued, with such luminaries as Heaviside weighing\r
1

in on the side of vectors. Ultimately the quaternions lost, and acquired a slight taint of disgrace\r
from which they have never fully recovered [27].\r
Less well-known is the discovery of the octonions by Hamilton’s friend from college, John T.\r
Graves. It was Graves’ interest in algebra that got Hamilton thinking about complex numbers\r
and triplets in the first place. The very day after his fateful walk, Hamilton sent an 8-page letter\r
describing the quaternions to Graves. Graves replied on October 26th, complimenting Hamilton on\r
the boldness of the idea, but adding “There is still something in the system which gravels me. I have\r
not yet any clear views as to the extent to which we are at liberty arbitrarily to create imaginaries,\r
and to endow them with supernatural properties.” And he asked: “If with your alchemy you can\r
make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?”\r
Graves then set to work on some gold of his own! On December 26th, he wrote to Hamilton\r
describing a new 8-dimensional algebra, which he called the ‘octaves’. He showed that they were a\r
normed division algebra, and used this to express the product of two sums of eight perfect squares\r
as another sum of eight perfect squares: the ‘eight squares theorem’ [52].\r
In January 1844, Graves sent three letters to Hamilton expanding on his discovery. He considered\r
the idea of a general theory of ‘2m-ions’, and tried to construct a 16-dimensional normed division\r
algebra, but he “met with an unexpected hitch” and came to doubt that this was possible. Hamilton\r
offered to publicize Graves’ discovery, but being busy with work on quaternions, he kept putting it\r
off. In July he wrote to Graves pointing out that the octonions were nonassociative: “A · BC =\r
AB · C = ABC, if A, B, C be quaternions, but not so, generally, with your octaves.” In fact,\r
Hamilton first invented the term ‘associative’ at about this time, so the octonions may have played\r
a role in clarifying the importance of this concept.\r
Meanwhile the young Arthur Cayley, fresh out of Cambridge, had been thinking about the\r
quaternions ever since Hamilton announced their existence. He seemed to be seeking relationships\r
between the quaternions and hyperelliptic functions. In March of 1845, he published a paper in the\r
Philosophical Magazine entitled ‘On Jacobi’s Elliptic Functions, in Reply to the Rev. B. Bronwin;\r
and on Quaternions’ [18]. The bulk of this paper was an attempt to rebut an article pointing out\r
mistakes in Cayley’s work on elliptic functions. Apparently as an afterthought, he tacked on a brief\r
description of the octonions. In fact, this paper was so full of errors that it was omitted from his\r
collected works — except for the part about octonions [19].\r
Upset at being beaten to publication, Graves attached a postscript to a paper of his own which\r
was to appear in the following issue of the same journal, saying that he had known of the octonions\r
ever since Christmas, 1843. On June 14th, 1847, Hamilton contributed a short note to the Transac\u0002tions of the Royal Irish Academy, vouching for Graves’ priority. But it was too late: the octonions\r
became known as ‘Cayley numbers’. Still worse, Graves later found that his eight squares theorem\r
had already been discovered by C. F. Degen in 1818 [28, 30].\r
Why have the octonions languished in such obscurity compared to the quaternions? Besides\r
their rather inglorious birth, one reason is that they lacked a tireless defender such as Hamilton.\r
But surely the reason for this is that they lacked any clear application to geometry and physics.\r
The unit quaternions form the group SU(2), which is the double cover of the rotation group SO(3).\r
This makes them nicely suited to the study of rotations and angular momentum, particularly in\r
the context of quantum mechanics. These days we regard this phenomenon as a special case of the\r
theory of Clifford algebras. Most of us no longer attribute to the quaternions the cosmic significance\r
that Hamilton claimed for them, but they fit nicely into our understanding of the scheme of things.\r
The octonions, on the other hand, do not. Their relevance to geometry was quite obscure\r
until 1925, when Elie Cartan described ‘triality’ — the symmetry between vec ´ tors and spinors in 8-\r
dimensional Euclidean space [17]. Their potential relevance to physics was noticed in a 1934 paper by\r
Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner on the foundations of quantum mechanics [59]. However, attempts\r
by Jordan and others to apply octonionic quantum mechanics to nuclear and particle physics met\r
with little success. Work along these lines continued quite slowly until the 1980s, when it was\r
realized that the octonions explain some curious features of string theory [65]. The Lagrangian for\r
2

the classical superstring involves a relationship between vectors and spinors in Minkowski spacetime\r
which holds only in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions. Note that these numbers are 2 more than the\r
dimensions of R, C, H and O. As we shall see, this is no coincidence: briefly, the isomorphisms\r
sl(2, R) ∼= so(2, 1)\r
sl(2, C) ∼= so(3, 1)\r
sl(2, H) ∼= so(5, 1)\r
sl(2, O) ∼= so(9, 1)\r
allow us to treat a spinor in one of these dimensions as a pair of elements of the corresponding division\r
algebra. It is fascinating that of these superstring Lagrangians, it is the 10-dimensional octonionic\r
one that gives the most promising candidate for a realistic theory of fundamental physics! However,\r
there is still no proof that the octonions are useful for understanding the real world. We can only\r
hope that eventually this question will be settled one way or another.\r
Besides their possible role in physics, the octonions are important because they tie together\r
some algebraic structures that otherwise appear as isolated and inexplicable exceptions. As we\r
shall explain, the concept of an octonionic projective space OPnonly makes sense for n ≤ 2, due\r
to the nonassociativity of O. This means that various structures associated to real, complex and\r
quaternionic projective spaces have octonionic analogues only for n ≤ 2.\r
Simple Lie algebras are a nice example of this phenomenon. There are 3 infinite families of\r
‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, which come from the isometry groups of the projective spaces RPn,\r
CPnand HPn. There are also 5 ‘exceptional’ simple Lie algebras. These were discovered by Killing\r
and Cartan in the late 1800s. At the time, the significance of these exceptions was shrouded in\r
mystery: they did not arise as symmetry groups of known structures. Only later did their connection\r
to the octonions become clear. It turns out that 4 of them come from the isometry groups of the\r
projective planes over O, O ⊗ C, O ⊗ H and O ⊗ O. The remaining one is the automorphism group\r
of the octonions!\r
Another good example is the classification of simple formally real Jordan algebras. Besides\r
several infinite families of these, there is the ‘exceptional’ Jordan algebra, which consists of 3 × 3\r
hermitian octonionic matrices. Minimal projections in this Jordan algebra correspond to points of\r
OP2, and the automorphism group of this algebra is the same as the isometry group of OP2.\r
The octonions also have fascinating connections to topology. In 1957, Raoul Bott computed\r
the homotopy groups of the topological group O(∞), which is the inductive limit of the orthogonal\r
groups O(n) as n → ∞. He proved that they repeat with period 8:\r
πi+8(O(∞)) ∼= πi(O(∞)).\r
This is known as ‘Bott periodicity’. He also computed the first 8:\r
π0(O(∞)) ∼= Z2\r
π1(O(∞)) ∼= Z2\r
π2(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π3(O(∞)) ∼= Z\r
π4(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π5(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π6(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π7(O(∞)) ∼= Z\r
Note that the nonvanishing homotopy groups here occur in dimensions one less than the dimensions\r
of R, C, H, and O. This is no coincidence! In a normed division algebra, left multiplication by an\r
element of norm one defines an orthogonal transformation of the algebra, and thus an element of\r
3

O(∞). This gives us maps from the spheres S\r
0\r
, S1, S3 and S\r
7\r
to O(∞), and these maps generate\r
the homotopy groups in those dimensions.\r
Given this, one might naturally guess that the period-8 repetition in the homotopy groups of\r
O(∞) is in some sense ‘caused’ by the octonions. As we shall see, this is true. Conversely, Bott\r
periodicity is closely connected to the problem of how many pointwise linearly independent smooth\r
vector fields can be found on the n-sphere [56]. There exist n such vector fields only when n + 1 =\r
1, 2, 4, or 8, and this can be used to show that division algebras over the reals can only occur in\r
these dimensions.\r
In what follows we shall try to explain the octonions and their role in algebra, geometry, and\r
topology. In Section 2 we give four constructions of the octonions: first via their multiplication\r
table, then using the Fano plane, then using the Cayley–Dickson construction and finally using\r
Clifford algebras, spinors, and a generalized concept of ‘triality’ advocated by Frank Adams [2].\r
Each approach has its own merits. In Section 3 we discuss the projective lines and planes over\r
the normed division algebras — especially O — and describe their relation to Bott periodicity, the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra, and the Lie algebra isomorphisms listed above. Finally, in Section 4 we\r
discuss octonionic constructions of the exceptional Lie groups, especially the ‘magic square’.\r
1.1 Preliminaries\r
Before our tour begins, let us settle on some definitions. For us a vector space will always be a\r
finite-dimensional module over the field of real numbers. An algebra A will be a vector space that\r
is equipped with a bilinear map m: A × A → A called ‘multiplication’ and a nonzero element 1 ∈ A\r
called the ‘unit’ such that m(1, a) = m(a, 1) = a. As usual, we abbreviate m(a, b) as ab. We do\r
not assume our algebras are associative! Given an algebra, we will freely think of real numbers as\r
elements of this algebra via the map α 7→ α1.\r
An algebra A is a division algebra if given a, b ∈ A with ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.\r
Equivalently, A is a division algebra if the operations of left and right multiplication by any nonzero\r
element are invertible. A normed division algebra is an algebra A that is also a normed vector\r
space with kabk = kakkbk. This implies that A is a division algebra and that k1k = 1.\r
We should warn the reader of some subtleties. We say an algebra A has multiplicative inverses\r
if for any nonzero a ∈ A there is an element a\r
−1 ∈ A with aa−1 = a−1a = 1. An associative algebra\r
has multiplicative inverses iff it is a division algebra. However, this fails for nonassociative algebras!\r
In Section 2.2 we shall construct algebras that have multiplicative inverses, but are not division\r
algebras. On the other hand, we can construct a division algebra without multiplicative inverses\r
by taking the quaternions and modifying the product slightly, setting i\r
2 = −1 + ǫj for some small\r
nonzero real number ǫ while leaving the rest of the multiplication table unchanged. The element\r
i then has both right and left inverses, but they are not equal. (We thank David Rusin for this\r
example.)\r
There are three levels of associativity. An algebra is power-associative if the subalgebra gen\u0002erated by any one element is associative. It is alternative if the subalgebra generated by any two\r
elements is associative. Finally, if the subalgebra generated by any three elements is associative, the\r
algebra is associative.\r
As we shall see, the octonions are not associative, but they are alternative. How does one check\r
a thing like this? By a theorem of Emil Artin [84], an algebra A is alternative iff for all a, b ∈ A we\r
have\r
(aa)b = a(ab), (ab)a = a(ba), (ba)a = b(aa) (1)\r
In fact, any two of these equations implies the remaining one, so people usually take the first and\r
last as the definition of ‘alternative’. To see this fact, note that any algebra has a trilinear map\r
[·, ·, ·]: A\r
3 → A\r
4

called the associator, given by\r
[a, b, c] = (ab)c − a(bc).\r
The associator measures the failure of associativity just as the commutator [a, b] = ab−ba measures\r
the failure of commutativity. Now, the commutator is an alternating bilinear map, meaning that it\r
switches sign whenever the two arguments are exchanged:\r
[a, b] = −[b, a]\r
or equivalently, that it vanishes when they are equal:\r
[a, a] = 0.\r
This raises the question of whether the associator is alternating too. In fact, this holds precisely\r
when A is alternative! The reason is that each equation in (1) says that the associator vanishes\r
when a certain pair of arguments are equal, or equivalently, that it changes sign when that pair of\r
arguments is switched. Note, however, that if the associator changes sign when we switch the ith\r
and jth arguments, and also when we switch the jth and kth arguments, it must change sign when\r
we switch the ith and kth. Thus any two of equations (1) imply the third.\r
Now we can say what is so great about R, C, H, and O:\r
Theorem 1. R, C, H, and O are the only normed division algebras.\r
Theorem 2. R, C, H, and O are the only alternative division algebras.\r
The first theorem goes back to an 1898 paper by Hurwitz [55]. It was subsequently generalized\r
in many directions, for example, to algebras over other fields. A version of the second theorem\r
appears in an 1930 paper by Zorn [100] — the guy with the lemma. For modern proofs of both these\r
theorems, see Schafer’s excellent book on nonassociative algebras [84]. We sketch a couple proofs of\r
Hurwitz’s theorem in Section 2.3.\r
Note that we did not state that R, C, H and O are the only division algebras. This is not true.\r
For example, we have already described a way to get 4-dimensional division algebras that do not\r
have multiplicative inverses. However, we do have this fact:\r
Theorem 3. All division algebras have dimension 1, 2, 4, or 8.\r
This was independently proved by Kervaire [62] and Bott–Milnor [11] in 1958. We will say a bit\r
about the proof in Section 3.1. However, in what follows our main focus will not be on general\r
results about division algebras. Instead, we concentrate on special features of the octonions. Let us\r
begin by constructing them.\r
2 Constructing the Octonions\r
The most elementary way to construct the octonions is to give their multiplication table. The\r
octonions are an 8-dimensional algebra with basis 1, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, and their multiplication\r
is given in this table, which describes the result of multiplying the element in the ith row by the\r
element in the jth column:\r
5

e1 e2 e3 e4 e5 e6 e7\r
e1 −1 e4 e7 −e2 e6 −e5 −e3\r
e2 −e4 −1 e5 e1 −e3 e7 −e6\r
e3 −e7 −e5 −1 e6 e2 −e4 e1\r
e4 e2 −e1 −e6 −1 e7 e3 −e5\r
e5 −e6 e3 −e2 −e7 −1 e1 e4\r
e6 e5 −e7 e4 −e3 −e1 −1 e2\r
e7 e3 e6 −e1 e5 −e4 −e2 −1\r
Table 1 — Octonion Multiplication Table\r
Unfortunately, this table is almost completely unenlightening! About the only interesting things one\r
can easily learn from it are:\r
• e1, . . . , e7 are square roots of -1,\r
• ei and ej anticommute when i 6= j:\r
eiej = −ejei\r
• the index cycling identity holds:\r
eiej = ek =⇒ ei+1ej+1 = ek+1\r
where we think of the indices as living in Z7, and\r
• the index doubling identity holds:\r
eiej = ek =⇒ e2ie2j = e2k.\r
Together with a single nontrivial product like e1e2 = e4, these facts are enough to recover the whole\r
multiplication table. However, we really want a better way to remember the octonion product.\r
We should become as comfortable with multiplying octonions as we are with multiplying matrices!\r
And ultimately, we want a more conceptual approach to the octonions, which explains their special\r
properties and how they fit in with other mathematical ideas. In what follows, we give some more\r
descriptions of octonion multiplication, starting with a nice mnemonic, and working up to some\r
deeper, more conceptual ones.\r
2.1 The Fano plane\r
The quaternions, H, are a 4-dimensional algebra with basis 1, i, j, k. To describe the product we\r
could give a multiplication table, but it is easier to remember that:\r
• 1 is the multiplicative identity,\r
• i, j, and k are square roots of -1,\r
• we have ij = k, ji = −k, and all identities obtained from these by cyclic permutations of\r
(i, j, k).\r
We can summarize the last rule in a picture:\r
6

k\r
i\r
j\r
When we multiply two elements going clockwise around the circle we get the next one: for example,\r
ij = k. But when we multiply two going around counterclockwise, we get minus the next one: for\r
example, ji = −k.\r
We can use the same sort of picture to remember how to multiply octonions:\r
i\r
e\r
4\r
e\r
3\r
e\r
e\r
7\r
e\r
1\r
e\r
52\r
e\r
6\r
This is the Fano plane, a little gadget with 7 points and 7 lines. The ‘lines’ are the sides of the\r
triangle, its altitudes, and the circle containing all the midpoints of the sides. Each pair of distinct\r
points lies on a unique line. Each line contains three points, and each of these triples has has a cyclic\r
ordering shown by the arrows. If ei, ej, and ek are cyclically ordered in this way then\r
eiej = ek, ejei = −ek.\r
Together with these rules:\r
• 1 is the multiplicative identity,\r
• e1, . . . , e7 are square roots of -1,\r
the Fano plane completely describes the algebra structure of the octonions. Index-doubling corre\u0002sponds to rotating the picture a third of a turn.\r
This is certainly a neat mnemonic, but is there anything deeper lurking behind it? Yes! The\r
Fano plane is the projective plane over the 2-element field Z2. In other words, it consists of lines\r
through the origin in the vector space Z\r
3\r
2\r
. Since every such line contains a single nonzero element,\r
we can also think of the Fano plane as consisting of the seven nonzero elements of Z\r
3\r
2\r
. If we think\r
of the origin in Z\r
3\r
2\r
as corresponding to 1 ∈ O, we get the following picture of the octonions:\r
1\r

Note that planes through the origin of this 3-dimensional vector space give subalgebras of O iso\u0002morphic to the quaternions, lines through the origin give subalgebras isomorphic to the complex\r
numbers, and the origin itself gives a subalgebra isomorphic to the real numbers.\r
What we really have here is a description of the octonions as a ‘twisted group algebra’. Given\r
any group G, the group algebra R[G] consists of all finite formal linear combinations of elements of\r
G with real coefficients. This is an associative algebra with the product coming from that of G. We\r
can use any function\r
α: G\r
2 → {±1}\r
to ‘twist’ this product, defining a new product\r
⋆: R[G] × R[G] → R[G]\r
by:\r
g ⋆ h = α(g, h) gh,\r
where g, h ∈ G ⊂ R[G]. One can figure out an equation involving α that guarantees this new product\r
will be associative. In this case we call α a ‘2-cocycle’. If α satisfies a certain extra equation, the\r
product ⋆ will also be commutative, and we call α a ‘stable 2-cocycle’. For example, the group\r
algebra R[Z2] is isomorphic to a product of 2 copies of R, but we can twist it by a stable 2-cocyle to\r
obtain the complex numbers. The group algebra R[Z\r
2\r
2\r
] is isomorphic to a product of 4 copies of R,\r
but we can twist it by a 2-cocycle to obtain the quaternions. Similarly, the group algebra R[Z\r
3\r
2\r
] is a\r
product of 8 copies of R, and what we have really done in this section is describe a function α that\r
allows us to twist this group algebra to obtain the octonions. Since the octonions are nonassociative,\r
this function is not a 2-cocycle. However, its coboundary is a ‘stable 3-cocycle’, which allows one\r
to define a new associator and braiding for the category of Z\r
3\r
2\r
-graded vector spaces, making it\r
into a symmetric monoidal category [4]. In this symmetric monoidal category, the octonions are a\r
commutative monoid object. In less technical terms: this category provides a context in which the\r
octonions are commutative and associative! So far this idea has just begun to be exploited.\r
2.2 The Cayley–Dickson construction\r
It would be nice to have a construction of the normed division algebras R, C, H, O that explained\r
why each one fits neatly inside the next. It would be nice if this construction made it clear why H\r
is noncommutative and O is nonassociative. It would be even better if this construction gave an\r
infinite sequence of algebras, doubling in dimension each time, with the normed division algebras as\r
the first four. In fact, there is such a construction: it’s called the Cayley–Dickson construction.\r
As Hamilton noted, the complex number a+bi can be thought of as a pair (a, b) of real numbers.\r
Addition is done component-wise, and multiplication goes like this:\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db, ad + cb)\r
We can also define the conjugate of a complex number by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a, −b).\r
Now that we have the complex numbers, we can define the quaternions in a similar way. A\r
quaternion can be thought of as a pair of complex numbers. Addition is done component-wise, and\r
multiplication goes like this:\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db∗, a∗d + cb) (2)\r
This is just like our formula for multiplication of complex numbers, but with a couple of conjugates\r
thrown in. If we included them in the previous formula nothing would change, since the conjugate\r
of a real number is just itself. We can also define the conjugate of a quaternion by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a∗\r
, −b). (3)\r
8

The game continues! Now we can define an octonion to be a pair of quaternions. As before, we\r
add and multiply them using formulas (2) and (3). This trick for getting new algebras from old is\r
called the Cayley–Dickson construction.\r
Why do the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions have multiplicative\r
inverses? I take it as obvious for the real numbers. For the complex numbers, one can check that\r
(a, b)(a, b)\r
∗ = (a, b)∗\r
(a, b) = k(1, 0)\r
where k is a real number, the square of the norm of (a, b). This means that whenever (a, b) is nonzero,\r
its multiplicative inverse is (a, b)\r
∗/k. One can check that the same holds for the quaternions and\r
octonions.\r
But this, of course, raises the question: why isn’t there an infinite sequence of division algebras,\r
each one obtained from the preceding one by the Cayley–Dickson construction? The answer is that\r
each time we apply the construction, our algebra gets a bit worse. First we lose the fact that every\r
element is its own conjugate, then we lose commutativity, then we lose associativity, and finally we\r
lose the division algebra property.\r
To see this clearly, it helps to be a bit more formal. Define a ∗-algebra to be an algebra A\r
equipped with a conjugation, that is, a real-linear map ∗: A → A with\r
a\r
∗∗ = a, (ab)∗ = b∗\r
a\r
∗\r
for all a, b ∈ A. We say a ∗-algebra is real if a = a\r
∗\r
for every element a of the algebra. We say the\r
∗-algebra A is nicely normed if a + a\r
∗ ∈ R and aa∗ = a∗a > 0 for all nonzero a ∈ A. If A is nicely\r
normed we set\r
Re(a) = (a + a\r
∗\r
)/2 ∈ R, Im(a) = (a − a\r
∗\r
)/2,\r
and define a norm on A by\r
kak\r
2 = aa∗\r
.\r
If A is nicely normed, it has multiplicative inverses given by\r
a\r
−1 = a∗\r
/kak\r
2\r
.\r
If A is nicely normed and alternative, A is a normed division algebra. To see this, note that for any\r
a, b ∈ A, all 4 elements a, b, a∗, b∗lie in the associative algebra generated by Im(a) and Im(b), so\r
that\r
kabk\r
2 = (ab)(ab)∗ = ab(b∗\r
a\r
∗\r
) = a(bb∗)a\r
∗ = kak2\r
kbk\r
2\r
.\r
Starting from any ∗-algebra A, the Cayley–Dickson construction gives a new ∗-algebra A′. El\u0002ements of A′ are pairs (a, b) ∈ A2\r
, and multiplication and conjugation are defined using equations\r
(2) and (3). The following propositions show the effect of repeatedly applying the Cayley–Dickson\r
construction:\r
Proposition 1. A′is never real.\r
Proposition 2. A is real (and thus commutative) ⇐⇒ A′is commutative.\r
Proposition 3. A is commutative and associative ⇐⇒ A′is associative.\r
Proposition 4. A is associative and nicely normed ⇐⇒ A′is alternative and nicely normed.\r
Proposition 5. A is nicely normed ⇐⇒ A′is nicely normed.\r
9

All of these follow from straightforward calculations; to prove them here would merely deprive the\r
reader of the pleasure of doing so. It follows from these propositions that:\r
R is a real commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
C is a commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
H is an associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
O is an alternative nicely normed ∗-algebra\r
and therefore that R, C, H, and O are normed division algebras. It also follows that the octonions\r
are neither real, nor commutative, nor associative.\r
If we keep applying the Cayley–Dickson process to the octonions we get a sequence of ∗-algebras\r
of dimension 16, 32, 64, and so on. The first of these is called the sedenions, presumably alluding\r
to the fact that it is 16-dimensional [67]. It follows from the above results that all the ∗-algebras in\r
this sequence are nicely normed but neither real, nor commutative, nor alternative. They all have\r
multiplicative inverses, since they are nicely normed. But they are not division algebras, since an\r
explicit calculation demonstrates that the sedenions, and thus all the rest, have zero divisors. In\r
fact [24, 73], the zero divisors of norm one in the sedenions form a subspace that is homeomorphic\r
to the exceptional Lie group G2.\r
The Cayley–Dickson construction provides a nice way to obtain the sequence R, H, C, O and the\r
basic properties of these algebras. But what is the meaning of this construction? To answer this,\r
it is better to define A′ as the algebra formed by adjoining to A an element i satisfying i\r
2 = −1\r
together with the following relations:\r
a(ib) = i(a\r
∗\r
b), (ai)b = (ab∗)i, (ia)(bi−1) = (ab)\r
∗\r
(4)\r
for all a, b ∈ A. We make A′into a ∗-algebra using the original conjugation on elements of A and\r
setting i\r
∗ = −i. It is easy to check that every element of A′\r
can be uniquely written as a + ib for\r
some a, b ∈ A, and that this description of the Cayley–Dickson construction becomes equivalent to\r
our previous one if we set (a, b) = a + ib.\r
What is the significance of the relations in (4)? Simply this: they express conjugation in terms\r
of conjugation! This is a pun on the double meaning of the word ‘conjugation’. What I really mean\r
is that they express the ∗ operation in A as conjugation by i. In particular, we have\r
a\r
∗ = (ia)i−1 = i(ai−1\r
)\r
for all a ∈ A. Note that when A′is associative, any one of the relations in (4) implies the other two.\r
It is when A′is nonassociative that we really need all three relations.\r
This interpretation of the Cayley–Dickson construction makes it easier to see what happens as\r
we repeatedly apply the construction starting with R. In R the ∗ operation does nothing, so when\r
we do the Cayley–Dickson construction, conjugation by i must have no effect on elements of R. Since\r
R is commutative, this means that C = R\r
′\r
is commutative. But C is no longer real, since i\r
∗ = −i.\r
Next let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to C. Since C is commutative, the ∗ op\u0002eration in C is an automorphism. Whenever we have an associative algebra A equipped with an\r
automorphism α, we can always extend A to a larger associative algebra by adjoining an invertible\r
element x with\r
α(a) = xax−1\r
for all a ∈ A. Since C is associative, this means that C\r
′ = H is associative. But since C is not real,\r
H cannot be commutative, since conjugation by the newly adjoined element i must have a nontrivial\r
effect.\r
Finally, let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to H. Since H is noncommutative, the ∗\r
operation in H is not an automorphism; it is merely an antiautomorphism. This means we cannot\r
express it as conjugation by some element of a larger associative algebra. Thus H′ = O must be\r
nonassociative.\r

2.3 Clifford Algebras\r
William Clifford invented his algebras in 1876 as an attempt to generalize the quaternions to higher\r
dimensions, and he published a paper about them two years later [23]. Given a real inner product\r
space V , the Clifford algebra Cliff(V ) is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the\r
relations\r
v\r
2 = −kvk2\r
for all v ∈ V . Equivalently, it is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the relations\r
vw + wv = −2hv, wi\r
for all v, w ∈ V . If V = R\r
n with its usual inner product, we call this Clifford algebra Cliff(n).\r
Concretely, this is the associative algebra freely generated by n anticommuting square roots of −1.\r
From this we easily see that\r
Cliff(0) = R, Cliff(1) = C, Cliff(2) = H.\r
So far this sequence resembles the iterated Cayley-Dickson construction — but the octonions are not\r
a Clifford algebra, since they are nonassociative. Nonetheless, there is a profound relation between\r
Clifford algebras and normed division algebras. This relationship gives a nice way to prove that\r
R, C, H and O are the only normed dvivision algebras. It is also crucial for understanding the\r
geometrical meaning of the octonions.\r
To see this relation, first suppose K is a normed division algebra. Left multiplication by any\r
element a ∈ K gives an operator\r
La : K → K\r
x 7→ ax.\r
If kak = 1, the operator La is norm-preserving, so it maps the unit sphere of K to itself. Since K\r
is a division algebra, we can find an operator of this form mapping any point on the unit sphere to\r
any other point. The only way the unit sphere in K can have this much symmetry is if the norm\r
on K comes from an inner product. Even better, this inner product is unique, since we can use the\r
polarization identity\r
hx, yi =\r
1\r
2\r
(kx + yk\r
2 − kxk2 − kyk2\r
)\r
to recover it from the norm.\r
Using this inner product, we say an element a ∈ K is imaginary if it is orthogonal to the element\r
1, and we let Im(K) be the space of imaginary elements of K. We can also think of Im(K) as the\r
tangent space of the unit sphere in K at the point 1. This has a nice consequence: since a 7→ La\r
maps the unit sphere in K to the Lie group of orthogonal transformations of K, it must send Im(K)\r
to the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint transformations of K. In short, La is skew-adjoint whenever a is\r
imaginary.\r
The relation to Clifford algebras shows up when we compute the square of La for a ∈ Im(K).\r
We can do this most easily when a has norm 1. Then La is both orthogonal and skew-adjoint. For\r
any orthogonal transformation, we can find some orthonormal basis in which its matrix is block\r
diagonal, built from 2 × 2 blocks that look like this:\r
\u0012\r
cos θ sin θ\r
− sin θ cos θ\r
\u0013\r
and possibly a 1×1 block like this: (1). Such a transformation can only be skew-adjoint if it consists\r
solely of 2 × 2 blocks of this form:\r
±\r
\u0012\r
0 1\r
−1 0 \u0013\r
.\r
11

In this case, its square is −1. We thus have L\r
2\r
a = −1 when a ∈ Im(K) has norm 1. It follows that\r
L\r
2\r
a = −kak\r
2\r
for all a ∈ Im(K). We thus obtain a representation of the Clifford algebra Cliff(Im(K)) on K. Any\r
n-dimensional normed division algebra thus gives an n-dimensional representation of Cliff(n − 1).\r
As we shall see, this is very constraining.\r
We have already described the Clifford algebras up to Cliff(2). Further calculations [54, 78] give\r
the following table, where we use A[n] to stand for n × n matrices with entries in the algebra A:\r
n Cliff(n)\r
0 R\r
1 C\r
2 H\r
3 H ⊕ H\r
4 H[2]\r
5 C[4]\r
6 R[8]\r
7 R[8] ⊕ R[8]\r
Table 2 — Clifford Algebras\r
Starting at dimension 8, something marvelous happens: the table continues in the following fashion:\r
Cliff(n + 8) ∼= Cliff(n) ⊗ R[16].\r
In other words, Cliff(n + 8) consists of 16 × 16 matrices with entries in Cliff(n). This ‘period\u00028’ behavior was discovered by Cartan in 1908 [16], but we will take the liberty of calling it Bott\r
periodicity, since it has a far-ranging set of applications to topology, some of which were discovered\r
by Bott.\r
Since Clifford algebras are built from matrix algebras over R, C and H, it is easy to determine\r
their representations. Every representation is a direct sum of irreducible ones. The only irreducible\r
representation of R[n] is its obvious one via matrix multiplication on R\r
n. Similarly, the only irre\u0002ducible representation of C[n] is the obvious one on C\r
n, and the only irreducible representation of\r
H[n] is the obvious one on Hn.\r
Glancing at the above table, we see that unless n equals 3 or 7 modulo 8, Cliff(n) is a real,\r
complex or quaternionic matrix algebra, so it has a unique irreducible representation. For reasons\r
to be explained later, this irreducible representation is known as the space of pinors and denoted\r
Pn. When n is 3 or 7 modulo 8, the algebra Cliff(n) is a direct sum of two real or quaternionic\r
matrix algebras, so it has two irreducible representations, which we call the positive pinors P\r
+\r
n\r
and negative pinors P\r
−\r
n\r
. We summarize these results in the following table:\r
n Cliff(n) irreducible representations\r
0 R P0 = R\r
1 C P1 = C\r
2 H P2 = H\r
3 H ⊕ H P\r
+\r
3 = H, P −\r
3 = H\r
4 H[2] P4 = H\r

5 C[4] P5 = C\r

6 R[8] P6 = R\r

7 R[8] ⊕ R[8] P\r
+\r
7 = R\r
8\r
, P −\r
7 = R\r
8\r
Table 3 — Pinor Representations\r
12

Examining this table, we see that in the range of dimensions listed there is an n-dimensional rep\u0002resentation of Cliff(n − 1) only for n = 1, 2, 4, and 8. What about higher dimensions? By Bott\r
periodicity, the irreducible representations of Cliff(n + 8) are obtained by tensoring those of Cliff(n)\r
by R\r
16. This multiplies the dimension by 16, so one can easily check that for n > 8, the irreducible\r
representations of Cliff(n − 1) always have dimension greater than n.\r
It follows that normed division algebras are only possible in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8. Having\r
constructed R, C, H and O, we also know that normed division algebras exist in these dimensions.\r
The only remaining question is whether they are unique. For this it helps to investigate more deeply\r
the relation between normed division algebras and the Cayley-Dickson construction. In what follows,\r
we outline an approach based on ideas in the book by Springer and Veldkamp [90].\r
First, suppose K is a normed division algebra. Then there is a unique linear operator ∗: K → K\r
such that 1∗ = 1 and a\r
∗ = −a for a ∈ Im(K). With some calculation one can prove this makes K\r
into a nicely normed ∗-algebra.\r
Next, suppose that K0 is any subalgebra of the normed division algebra K. It is easy to check\r
that K0 is a nicely normed ∗-algebra in its own right. If K0 is not all of K, we can find an element\r
i ∈ K that is orthogonal to every element of K0. Without loss of generality we shall assume this\r
element has norm 1. Since this element i is orthogonal to 1 ∈ K0, it is imaginary. From the definition\r
of the ∗ operator it follows that i\r
∗ = −i, and from results earlier in this section we have i2 = −1.\r
With further calculation one can show that for all a, a′ ∈ K0 we have\r
a(ia′) = i(a\r
∗\r
a\r
′\r
), (ai)a\r
′ = (aa′∗)i, (ia)(a′\r
i\r
−1\r
) = (aa′)\r
∗\r
A glance at equation (4) reveals that these are exactly the relations defining the Cayley-Dickson\r
construction! With a little thought, it follows that the subalgebra of K generated by K0 and i is\r
isomorphic as a ∗-algebra to K′\r
0\r
, the ∗-algebra obtained from K0 by the Cayley-Dickson construction.\r
Thus, whenever we have a normed division algebra K we can find a chain of subalgebras R =\r
K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Kn = K such that Ki+1 ∼= K′\r
i\r
. To construct Ki+1, we simply need to choose a\r
norm-one element of K that is orthogonal to every element of Ki. It follows that the only normed\r
division algebras of dimension 1, 2, 4 and 8 are R, C, H and O. This also gives an alternate proof\r
that there are no normed division algebras of other dimensions: if there were any, there would have\r
to be a 16-dimensional one, namely O′ — the sedenions. But as mentioned in Section 2.2, one can\r
check explicitly that the sedenions are not a division algebra.\r
2.4 Spinors and Trialities\r
A nonassociative division algebra may seem like a strange thing to bother with, but the notion of\r
triality makes it seem a bit more natural. The concept of duality is important throughout linear\r
algebra. The concept of triality is similar, but considerably subtler. Given vector spaces V1 and V2,\r
we may define a duality to be a bilinear map\r
f: V1 × V2 → R\r
that is nondegenerate, meaning that if we fix either argument to any nonzero value, the linear\r
functional induced on the other vector space is nonzero. Similarly, given vector spaces V1, V2, and\r
V3, a triality is a trilinear map\r
t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R\r
that is nondegenerate in the sense that if we fix any two arguments to any nonzero values, the linear\r
functional induced on the third vector space is nonzero.\r
Dualities are easy to come by. Trialities are much rarer. For suppose we have a triality\r
t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R.\r
13

By dualizing, we can turn this into a bilinear map\r
m: V1 × V2 → V\r
∗\r
3\r
which we call ‘multiplication’. By the nondegeneracy of our triality, left multiplication by any\r
nonzero element of V1 defines an isomorphism from V2 to V\r
∗\r
3\r
. Similarly, right multiplication by any\r
nonzero element of V2 defines an isomorphism from V1 to V\r
∗\r
3\r
. If we choose nonzero elements e1 ∈ V1\r
and e2 ∈ V2, we can thereby identify the spaces V1, V2 and V\r
∗\r
3 with a single vector space, say V .\r
Note that this identifies all three vectors e1 ∈ V1, e2 ∈ V2, and e1e2 ∈ V\r
∗\r
3 with the same vector\r
e ∈ V . We thus obtain a product\r
m: V × V → V\r
for which e is the left and right unit. Since left or right multiplication by any nonzero element is an\r
isomorphism, V is actually a division algebra! Conversely, any division algebra gives a triality.\r
It follows from Theorem 3 that trialities only occur in dimensions 1, 2, 4, or 8. This theorem\r
is quite deep. By comparison, Hurwitz’s classification of normed division algebras is easy to prove.\r
Not surprisingly, these correspond to a special sort of triality, which we call a ‘normed’ triality.\r
To be precise, a normed triality consists of inner product spaces V1, V2, V3 equipped with a\r
trilinear map t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R with\r
|t(v1, v2, v3)| ≤ kv1k kv2k kv3k,\r
and such that for all v1, v2 there exists v3 6= 0 for which this bound is attained — and similarly for\r
cyclic permutations of 1, 2, 3. Given a normed triality, picking unit vectors in any two of the spaces\r
Vi allows us to identify all three spaces and get a normed division algebra. Conversely, any normed\r
division algebra gives a normed triality.\r
But where do normed trialities come from? They come from the theory of spinors! From\r
Section 2.3, we already know that any n-dimensional normed division algebra is a representation\r
of Cliff(n − 1), so it makes sense to look for normed trialities here. In fact, representations of\r
Cliff(n − 1) give certain representations of Spin(n), the double cover of the rotation group in n\r
dimensions. These are called ‘spinors’. As we shall see, the relation between spinors and vectors\r
gives a nice way to construct normed trialities in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8.\r
To see how this works, first let Pin(n) be the group sitting inside Cliff(n) that consists of all\r
products of unit vectors in R\r
n. This group is a double cover of the orthogonal group O(n), where\r
given any unit vector v ∈ R\r
n, we map both ±v ∈ Pin(n) to the element of O(n) that reflects across\r
the hyperplane perpendicular to v. Since every element of O(n) is a product of reflections, this\r
homomorphism is indeed onto.\r
Next, let Spin(n) ⊂ Pin(n) be the subgroup consisting of all elements that are a product of an\r
even number of unit vectors in R\r
n\r
. An element of O(n) has determinant 1 iff it is the product of an\r
even number of reflections, so just as Pin(n) is a double cover of O(n), Spin(n) is a double cover of\r
SO(n). Together with a French dirty joke which we shall not explain, this analogy is the origin of\r
the terms ‘Pin’ and ‘pinor’.\r
Since Pin(n) sits inside Cliff(n), the irreducible representations of Cliff(n) restrict to representa\u0002tions of Pin(n), which turn out to be still irreducible. These are again called pinors, and we know\r
what they are from Table 3. Similarly, Spin(n) sits inside the subalgebra\r
Cliff0(n) ⊆ Cliff(n)\r
consisting of all linear combinations of products of an even number of vectors in R\r
n. Thus the\r
irreducible representations of Cliff0(n) restrict to representations of Spin(n), which turn out to be\r
still irreducible. These are called spinors — but we warn the reader that this term is also used for\r
many slight variations on this concept.\r
14

In fact, there is an isomorphism\r
φ: Cliff(n − 1) → Cliff0(n)\r
given as follows:\r
φ(ei) = eien, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,\r
where {ei} is an orthonormal basis for R\r
n. Thus spinors in n dimensions are the same as pinors in\r
n − 1 dimensions! Table 3 therefore yields the following table, where we use similar notation but\r
with ‘S’ instead of ‘P’:\r
n Cliff0(n) irreducible representations\r
1 R S1 = R\r
2 C S2 = C\r
3 H S3 = H\r
4 H ⊕ H S\r
+\r
4 = H, S−4 = H\r
5 H[2] S5 = H\r
2\r
6 C[4] S6 = C\r
4\r
7 R[8] S7 = R\r
8\r
8 R[8] ⊕ R[8] S\r
+\r
8 = R\r
8\r
, S−\r
8 = R\r
8\r
Table 4 — Spinor Representations\r
We call S\r
+\r
n and S\r
−\r
n the right-handed and left-handed spinor representations. For n > 8 we can\r
work out the spinor representations using Bott periodicity:\r
Sn+8 ∼= Sn ⊗ R\r
16\r
and similarly for right-handed and left-handed spinors.\r
Now, besides its pinor representation(s), the group Pin(n) also has an irreducible representation\r
where we first apply the 2–1 homomorphism Pin(n) → O(n) and then use the obvious representation\r
of O(n) on R\r
n. We call this the vector representation, Vn. As a vector space Vn is just Rn, and\r
Cliff(n) is generated by R\r
n, so we have an inclusion\r
Vn ֒→ Cliff(n).\r
Using this, we can restrict the action of the Clifford algebra on pinors to a map\r
mn: Vn × P\r
±\r
n → P\r
±\r
n n ≡ 3, 7 mod 8\r
mn: Vn × Pn → Pn otherwise.\r
This map is actually an intertwining operator between representations of Pin(n). If we restrict the\r
vector representation to the subgroup Spin(n), it remains irreducible. This is not always true for the\r
pinor representations, but we can always decompose them as a direct sum of spinor representations.\r
Applying this decomposition to the map mn, we get a map\r
mn: Vn × S\r
±\r
n → S\r
∓\r
n n ≡ 0, 4 mod 8\r
mn: Vn × Sn → Sn otherwise.\r
All the spinor representations appearing here are self-dual, so we can dualize the above maps and\r
reinterpret them as trilinear maps\r
tn: Vn × S\r
+\r
n × S\r
−\r
n → R n ≡ 0, 4 mod 8\r
tn: Vn × Sn × Sn → R otherwise.\r
15

These trilinear maps are candidates for trialities! However, they can only be trialities when the\r
dimension of the vector representation matches that of the relevant spinor representations. In the\r
range of the above table this happens only for n = 1, 2, 4, 8. In these cases we actually do get normed\r
trialities, which in turn give normed division algebras:\r
t1: V1 × S1 × S1 → R gives R.\r
t2: V2 × S2 × S2 → R gives C.\r
t4: V4 × S\r
+\r
4 × S\r
−\r
4 → R gives H.\r
t8: V8 × S\r
+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → R gives O.\r
In higher dimensions, the spinor representations become bigger than the vector representation, so\r
we get no more trialities this way — and of course, none exist.\r
Of the four normed trialities, the one that gives the octonions has an interesting property that\r
the rest lack. To see this property, one must pay careful attention to the difference between a normed\r
triality and a normed division algebra. To construct a normed division K algebra from the normed\r
triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R, we must arbitrarily choose unit vectors in two of the three spaces, so\r
the symmetry group of K is smaller than that of t. More precisely, let us define a automorphism\r
of the normed triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R to be a triple of norm–preserving maps fi: Vi → Vi such\r
that\r
t(f1(v1), f2(v2), f3(v3)) = t(v1, v2, v3)\r
for all vi ∈ Vi. These automorphisms form a group we call Aut(t). If we construct a normed division\r
algebra K from t by choosing unit vectors e1 ∈ V1, e2 ∈ V2, we have\r
Aut(K) ∼= {(f1, f2, f3) ∈ Aut(t) : f1(e1) = e1, f2(e2) = e2}.\r
In particular, it turns out that:\r
1 ∼= Aut(R) ⊆ Aut(t1) ∼= {(g1, g2, g3) ∈ O(1)3: g1g2g3 = 1}\r
Z2\r
∼= Aut(C) ⊆ Aut(t2) ∼= {(g1, g2, g3) ∈ U(1)3\r
: g1g2g3 = 1} × Z2\r
SO(3) ∼= Aut(H) ⊆ Aut(t4) ∼= Sp(1)3/{±(1, 1, 1)}\r
G2\r
∼= Aut(O) ⊆ Aut(t8) ∼= Spin(8)\r
(5)\r
where\r
O(1) ∼= Z2, U(1) ∼= SO(2), Sp(1) ∼= SU(2)\r
are the unit spheres in R, C and H, respectively — the only spheres that are Lie groups. G2 is just\r
another name for the automorphism group of the octonions; we shall study this group in Section 4.1.\r
The bigger group Spin(8) acts as automorphisms of the triality that gives the octonions, and it does\r
so in an interesting way. Given any element g ∈ Spin(8), there exist unique elements g± ∈ Spin(8)\r
such that\r
t(g(v1), g+(v2), g−(v3)) = t(v1, v2, v3)\r
for all v1 ∈ V8, v2 ∈ S\r
+\r
8\r
, and v3 ∈ S\r
−\r
8\r
. Moreover, the maps\r
α±: g → g±\r
are outer automorphisms of Spin(8). In fact Out(Spin(8)) is the permutation group on 3 letters, and\r
there exist outer automorphisms that have the effect of permuting the vector, left-handed spinor,\r
and right-handed spinor representations any way one likes; α+ and α− are among these.\r
In general, outer automorphisms of simple Lie groups come from symmetries of their Dynkin\r
diagrams. Of all the simple Lie groups, Spin(8) has the most symmetrical Dynkin diagram! It looks\r
like this:\r
16

Here the three outer nodes correspond to the vector, left-handed spinor and right-handed spinor\r
representations of Spin(8), while the central node corresponds to the adjoint representation —\r
that is, the representation of Spin(8) on its own Lie algebra, better known as so(8). The outer\r
automorphisms corresponding to the symmetries of this diagram were discovered in 1925 by Cartan\r
[17], who called these symmetries triality. The more general notion of ‘triality’ we have been\r
discussing here came later, and is apparently due to Adams [2].\r
The construction of division algebras from trialities has tantalizing links to physics. In the\r
Standard Model of particle physics, all particles other than the Higgs boson transform either as\r
vectors or spinors. The vector particles are also called ‘gauge bosons’, and they serve to carry the\r
forces in the Standard Model. The spinor particles are also called ‘fermions’, and they correspond\r
to the basic forms of matter: quarks and leptons. The interaction between matter and the forces is\r
described by a trilinear map involving two spinors and one vector. This map is often drawn as a\r
Feynman diagram:\r
where the straight lines denote spinors and the wiggly one denotes a vector. The most familiar\r
example is the process whereby an electron emits or absorbs a photon.\r
It is fascinating that the same sort of mathematics can be used both to construct the normed\r
division algebras and to describe the interaction between matter and forces. Could this be important\r
for physics? One prima facie problem with this speculation is that physics uses spinors associated to\r
Lorentz groups rather than rotation groups, due to the fact that spacetime has a Lorentzian rather\r
than Euclidean metric. However, in Section 3.3 we describe a way around this problem. Just as\r
octonions give the spinor representations of Spin(8), pairs of octonions give the spinor representations\r
of Spin(9, 1). This is one reason so many theories of physics work best when spacetime is 10-\r
dimensional! Examples include superstring theory [29, 46], supersymmetric gauge theories [35, 65,\r
85], and Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C⊗H⊗O, in which\r
the 3 forces arise naturally from the three factors in this tensor product [31].\r
3 Octonionic Projective Geometry\r
Projective geometry is a venerable subject that has its origins in the study of perspective by Re\u0002naissance painters. As seen by the eye, parallel lines — e.g., train tracks — appear to meet at a\r
‘point at infinity’. When one changes ones viewpoint, distances and angles appear to change, but\r
points remain points and lines remain lines. These facts suggest a modification of Euclidean plane\r
geometry, based on a set of points, a set of lines, and relation whereby a point ‘lies on’ a line,\r
satisfying the following axioms:\r
• For any two distinct points, there is a unique line on which they both lie.\r
• For any two distinct lines, there is a unique point which lies on both of them.\r
17

• There exist four points, no three of which lie on the same line.\r
• There exist four lines, no three of which have the same point lying on them.\r
A structure satisfying these axioms is called a projective plane. Part of the charm of this definition\r
is that it is ‘self-dual’: if we switch the words ‘point’ and ‘line’ and switch who lies on whom, it\r
stays the same.\r
We have already met one example of a projective plane in Section 2.1: the smallest one of all, the\r
Fano plane. The example relevant to perspective is the real projective plane, RP2. Here the points\r
are lines through the origin in R\r
3\r
, the lines are planes through the origin in R\r
3\r
, and the relation of\r
‘lying on’ is taken to be inclusion. Each point (x, y) ∈ R\r
2 determines a point in RP2\r
, namely the\r
line in R\r
3\r
containing the origin and the point (x, y, −1):\r
(0,0,0)\r
( , ,−1) x y\r
There are also other points in RP2, the ‘points at infinity’, corresponding to lines through the origin\r
in R\r
3\r
that do not intersect the plane {z = −1}. For example, any point on the horizon in the above\r
picture determines a point at infinity.\r
Projective geometry is also interesting in higher dimensions. One can define a projective space\r
by the following axioms:\r
• For any two distinct points p, q, there is a unique line pq on which they both lie.\r
• For any line, there are at least three points lying on this line.\r
• If a, b, c, d are distinct points and there is a point lying on both ab and cd, then there is a point\r
lying on both ac and bd.\r
Given a projective space and a set S of points in this space, we define the span of S to be the\r
smallest set T of points containing S such that if a and b lie in T , so do all points on the line ab.\r
The dimension of a projective space is defined to be one less than the minimal cardinality of a set\r
that spans the whole space. The reader may enjoy showing that a 2-dimensional projective space is\r
the same thing as a projective plane [44].\r
If K is any field, there is an n-dimensional projective space called KPn where the points are lines\r
through the origin in Kn+1, the lines are planes through the origin in Kn+1, and the relation of\r
‘lying on’ is inclusion. In fact, this construction works even when K is a mere skew field: a ring\r
such that every nonzero element has a left and right multiplicative inverse. We just need to be a bit\r
careful about defining lines and planes through the origin in Kn+1. To do this, we use the fact that\r
Kn+1 is a K-bimodule in an obvious way. We take a line through the origin to be any set\r
L = {αx : α ∈ K}\r
where x ∈ Kn+1 is nonzero, and take a plane through the origin to be any set\r
P = {αx + βy : α, β ∈ K}\r
18

where x, y ∈ Kn+1 are elements such that αx + βy = 0 implies α, β = 0.\r
Given this example, the question naturally arises whether every projective n-space is of the form\r
KPnfor some skew field K. The answer is quite surprising: yes, but only if n > 2. Projective planes\r
are more subtle [91]. A projective plane comes from a skew field if and only if it satisfies an extra\r
axiom, the ‘axiom of Desargues’, which goes as follows. Define a triangle to be a triple of points\r
that don’t all lie on the same line. Now, suppose we have two triangles xyz and x\r
′y′\r
z\r
′\r
. The sides of\r
each triangle determine three lines, say LMN and L\r
′M′N′\r
. Sometimes the line through x and x\r
′\r
,\r
the line through y and y\r
′\r
, and the line through z and z\r
′ will all intersect at the same point:\r
x\r
y\r
M\r
L\r
N\r
y\r
z\r
z\r
x\r
L\r
N\r
M\r
The axiom of Desargues says that whenever this happens, something else happens: the intersec\u0002tion of L and L\r
′\r
, the intersection of M and M′, and the intersection of N and N′ all lie on the same\r
line:\r
N\r
M\r
L\r
L\r
N\r
M\r
This axiom holds automatically for projective spaces of dimension 3 or more, but not for projective\r
planes. A projective plane satisfying this axiom is called Desarguesian.\r
The axiom of Desargues is pretty, but what is its connection to skew fields? Suppose we start\r
with a projective plane P and try to reconstruct a skew field from it. We can choose any line L,\r
choose three distinct points on this line, call them 0, 1, and ∞, and set K = L − {∞}. Copying\r
geometric constructions that work when P = RP2, we can define addition and multiplication of\r
points in K. In general the resulting structure (K, +, 0, ·, 1) will not be a skew field. Even worse, it\r
will depend in a nontrivial way on the choices made. However, if we assume the axiom of Desargues,\r
these problems go away. We thus obtain a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes\r
of skew fields and isomorphism classes of Desarguesian projective planes.\r
Projective geometry was very fashionable in the 1800s, with such worthies as Poncelet, Brianchon,\r
Steiner and von Staudt making important contributions. Later it was overshadowed by other forms\r
of geometry. However, work on the subject continued, and in 1933 Ruth Moufang constructed a\r
remarkable example of a non-Desarguesian projective plane using the octonions [74]. As we shall\r
see, this projective plane deserves the name OP2.\r
The 1930s also saw the rise of another reason for interest in projective geometry: quantum\r
mechanics! Quantum theory is distressingly different from the classical Newtonian physics we have\r
19

learnt to love. In classical mechanics, observables are described by real-valued functions. In quantum\r
mechanics, they are often described by hermitian n×n complex matrices. In both cases, observables\r
are closed under addition and multiplication by real scalars. However, in quantum mechanics,\r
observables do not form an associative algebra. Still, one can raise an observable to a power, and\r
from squaring one can construct a commutative but nonassociative product:\r
a ◦ b =\r
1\r
2\r
((a + b)\r
2 − a2 − b2\r
) = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
In 1932, Pascual Jordan attempted to understand this situation better by isolating the bare minimum\r
axioms that an ‘algebra of observables’ should satisfy [57]. He invented the definition of what is now\r
called a formally real Jordan algebra: a commutative and power-associative algebra satisfying\r
a\r
2\r
1 + · · · + a\r
2\r
n = 0 =⇒ a1 = · · · = an = 0\r
for all n. The last condition gives the algebra a partial ordering: if we write a ≤ b when the element\r
b − a is a sum of squares, it says that a ≤ b and b ≤ a imply a = b. Though it is not obvious, any\r
formally real Jordan algebra satisfies the identity\r
a ◦ (b ◦ a\r
2\r
) = (a ◦ b) ◦ a\r
2\r
for all elements a and b. Any commutative algebra satisfying this identity is called a Jordan\r
algebra. Jordan algebras are automatically power-associative.\r
In 1934, Jordan published a paper with von Neumann and Wigner classifying all formally real\r
Jordan algebras [59]. The classification is nice and succinct. An ideal in the Jordan algebra A is a\r
subspace B ⊆ A such that b ∈ B implies a ◦ b ∈ B for all a ∈ A. A Jordan algebra A is simple if its\r
only ideals are {0} and A itself. Every formally real Jordan algebra is a direct sum of simple ones.\r
The simple formally real Jordan algebras consist of 4 infinite families and one exception.\r
1. The algebra hn(R) with the product a ◦ b = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
2. The algebra hn(C) with the product a ◦ b = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
3. The algebra hn(H) with the product a ◦ b = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
4. The algebra R\r
n ⊕ R with the product\r
(v, α) ◦ (w, β) = (αw + βv,hv, wi + αβ).\r
5. The algebra h3(O) with the product a ◦ b =\r
1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
Here we say a square matrix with entries in the ∗-algebra A is hermitian if it equals its conjugate\r
transpose, and we let hn(A) stand for the hermitian n×n matrices with entries in A. Jordan algebras\r
in the fourth family are called spin factors, while h3(O) is called the exceptional Jordan algebra.\r
This classification raises some obvious questions. Why does nature prefer the Jordan algebras hn(C)\r
over all the rest? Or does it? Could the other Jordan algebras — even the exceptional one — have\r
some role to play in quantum physics? Despite much research, these questions remain unanswered\r
to this day.\r
The paper by Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner appears to have been uninfluenced by Moufang’s\r
discovery of OP2, but in fact they are related. A projection in a formally real Jordan algebra is\r
defined to be an element p with p\r
2 = p. In the familiar case of hn(C), these correspond to hermitian\r
matrices with eigenvalues 0 and 1, so they are used to describe observables that assume only two\r
values — e.g., ‘true’ and ‘false’. This suggests treating projections in a formally real Jordan algebra\r
as propositions in a kind of ‘quantum logic’. The partial order helps us do this: given projections p\r
and q, we say that p ‘implies’ q if p ≤ q.\r
20

The relation between Jordan algebras and quantum logic is already interesting [34], but the\r
real fun starts when we note that projections in hn(C) correspond to subspaces of C\r
n. This sets\r
up a relationship to projective geometry [98], since the projections onto 1-dimensional subspaces\r
correspond to points in CPn, while the projections onto 2-dimensional subspaces correspond to\r
lines. Even better, we can work out the dimension of a subspace V ⊆ C\r
n\r
from the corresponding\r
projection p: C\r
n → V using only the partial order on projections: V has dimension d iff the longest\r
chain of distinct projections\r
0 = p0 < · · · < pi = p\r
has length i = d. In fact, we can use this to define the rank of a projection in any formally\r
real Jordan algebra. We can then try to construct a projective space whose points are the rank-1\r
projections and whose lines are the rank-2 projections, with the relation of ‘lying on’ given by the\r
partial order ≤.\r
If we try this starting with hn(R), hn(C) or hn(H), we succeed when n ≥ 2, and we obtain the\r
projective spaces RPn, CPnand HPn, respectively. If we try this starting with the spin factor R\r
n⊕R\r
we succeed when n ≥ 2, and obtain a series of 1-dimensional projective spaces related to Lorentzian\r
geometry. Finally, in 1949 Jordan [58] discovered that if we try this construction starting with the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra, we get the projective plane discovered by Moufang: OP2.\r
In what follows we describe the octonionic projective plane and exceptional Jordan algebra in\r
more detail. But first let us consider the octonionic projective line, and the Jordan algebra h2(O).\r
3.1 Projective Lines\r
A one-dimensional projective space is called a projective line. Projective lines are not very inter\u0002esting from the viewpoint of axiomatic projective geometry, since they have only one line on which\r
all the points lie. Nonetheless, they can be geometrically and topologically interesting. This is\r
especially true of the octonionic projective line. As we shall see, this space has a deep connection\r
to Bott periodicity, and also to the Lorentzian geometry of 10-dimensional spacetime.\r
Suppose K is a normed division algebra. We have already defined KP1 when K is associative,\r
but this definition does not work well for the octonions: it is wiser to take a detour through Jordan\r
algebras. Let h2(K) be the space of 2 × 2 hermitian matrices with entries in K. It is easy to check\r
that this becomes a Jordan algebra with the product a ◦ b =\r
1\r
2\r
(ab + ba). We can try to build a\r
projective space from this Jordan algebra using the construction in the previous section. To see if\r
this succeeds, we need to ponder the projections in h2(K). A little calculation shows that besides\r
the trivial projections 0 and 1, they are all of the form\r
\u0012\r
x\r
∗\r
y\r
∗\r
\u0013\r
\r
x y \u0001\r
=\r
\u0012\r
x\r
∗x x∗y\r
y\r
∗x y∗y\r
\u0013\r
where (x, y) ∈ K2 has\r
kxk\r
2 + kyk2 = 1.\r
These nontrivial projections all have rank 1, so they are the points of our would–be projective space.\r
Our would–be projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1, and all the points\r
lie on this line. It is easy to check that the axioms for a projective space hold. Since this projective\r
space is 1-dimensional, we have succeeded in creating the projective line over K. We call the set\r
of points of this projective line KP1.\r
Given any nonzero element (x, y) ∈ K2, we can normalize it and then use the above formula to\r
get a point in KP1, which we call [(x, y)]. This allows us to describe KP1in terms of lines through\r
the origin, as follows. Define an equivalence relation on nonzero elements of K2 by\r
(x, y) ∼ (x\r
′\r
, y′) ⇐⇒ [(x, y)] = [(x\r
′\r
, y′)].\r
21

We call an equivalence class for this relation a line through the origin in K2\r
. We can then identify\r
points in KP1 with lines through the origin in K2.\r
Be careful: when K is the octonions, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is not always\r
equal to\r
{(αx, αy) : α ∈ K}.\r
This is only true when K is associative, or when x or y is 1. Luckily, we have (x, y) ∼ (y\r
−1x, 1)\r
when y 6= 0 and (x, y) ∼ (1, x−1y) when x 6= 0. Thus in either case we get a concrete description of\r
the line through the origin containing (x, y): when x 6= 0 it equals\r
{(α(y\r
−1x), α) : α ∈ K},\r
and when y 6= 0 it equals\r
{(α, α(x\r
−1\r
y) : α ∈ K}.\r
In particular, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is always a real vector space isomorphic\r
to K.\r
We can make KP1into a manifold as follows. By the above observations, we can cover it with\r
two coordinate charts: one containing all points of the form [(x, 1)], the other containing all points\r
of the form [(1, y)]. It is easy to check that [(x, 1)] = [(1, y)] iff y = x\r
−1\r
, so the transition function\r
from the first chart to the second is the map x 7→ x\r
−1\r
. Since this transition function and its inverse\r
are smooth on the intersection of the two charts, KP1becomes a smooth manifold.\r
When pondering the geometry of projective lines it is handy to visualize the complex case, since\r
CP1is just the familiar ‘Riemann sphere’. In this case, the map\r
x 7→ [(x, 1)]\r
is given by stereographic projection:\r
x\r
[ ,1] x\r
0\r
where we choose the sphere to have diameter 1. This map from C to CP1is one-to-one and almost\r
onto, missing only the point at infinity, or ‘north pole’. Similarly, the map\r
y 7→ [(1, y)]\r
misses only the south pole. Composing the first map with the inverse of the second, we get the\r
map x 7→ x\r
−1\r
, which goes by the name of ‘conformal inversion’. The southern hemisphere of the\r
Riemann sphere consists of all points [(x, 1)] with kxk ≤ 1, while the northern hemisphere consists\r
of all [(1, y)] with kyk ≤ 1. Unit complex numbers x give points [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1)] on the equator.\r
All these ideas painlessly generalize to KP1for any normed division algebra K. First of all, as a\r
smooth manifold KP1is just a sphere with dimension equal to that of K:\r
RP1 ∼= S\r
1\r
CP1 ∼= S\r
2\r
HP1 ∼= S\r
4\r
OP1 ∼= S\r
8\r
.\r
22

We can think of it as the one-point compactification of K. The ‘southern hemisphere’, ‘northern\r
hemisphere’, and ‘equator’ of K have descriptions exactly like those given above for the complex\r
case. Also, as in the complex case, the maps x 7→ [(x, 1)] and y 7→ [(1, y)] are angle-preserving with\r
respect to the usual Euclidean metric on K and the round metric on the sphere.\r
One of the nice things about KP1is that it comes equipped with a vector bundle whose fiber over\r
the point [(x, y)] is the line through the origin corresponding to this point. This bundle is called the\r
canonical line bundle, LK. Of course, when we are working with a particular division algebra,\r
‘line’ means a copy of this division algebra, so if we think of them as real vector bundles, LR, LC, LH\r
and LO have dimensions 1,2,4, and 8, respectively.\r
These bundles play an important role in topology, so it is good to understand them in a number\r
of ways. In general, any k-dimensional real vector bundle over S\r
n can be formed by taking trivial\r
bundles over the northern and southern hemispheres and gluing them together along the equator via\r
a map f: S\r
n−1 → O(k). We must therefore be able to build the canonical line bundles LR, LC, LH\r
and LO using maps\r
fR: S\r
0 → O(1)\r
fC: S\r
1 → O(2)\r
fH: S\r
3 → O(4)\r
fO: S\r
7 → O(8).\r
What are these maps? We can describe them all simultaneously. Suppose K is a normed division\r
algebra of dimension n. In the southern hemisphere of KP1, we can identify any fiber of LK with K\r
by mapping the point (αx, α) in the line [(x, 1)] to the element α ∈ K. This trivializes the canonical\r
line bundle over the southern hemisphere. Similarly, we can trivialize this bundle over the northern\r
hemisphere by mapping the point (β, βy) in the line [(1, y)] to the element β ∈ K. If x ∈ K has\r
norm one, [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1)] is a point on the equator, so we get two trivializations of the fiber\r
over this point. These are related as follows: if (αx, α) = (β, βx−1) then β = αx. The map α 7→ β\r
is thus right multiplication by x. In short,\r
fK: S\r
n−1 → O(n)\r
is just the map sending any norm-one element x ∈ K to the operation of right multiplication by x.\r
The importance of the map fK becomes clearest if we form the inductive limit of the groups O(n)\r
using the obvious inclusions O(n) ֒→ O(n + 1), obtaining a topological group called O(∞). Since\r
O(n) is included in O(∞), we can think of fK as a map from S\r
n−1\r
to O(∞). Its homotopy class\r
[fK] has the following marvelous property, mentioned in the Introduction:\r
• [fR] generates π0(O(∞)) ∼= Z2.\r
• [fC] generates π1(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
• [fH] generates π3(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
• [fO] generates π7(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
Another nice perspective on the canonical line bundles LK comes from looking at their unit\r
sphere bundles. Any fiber of LK is naturally an inner product space, since it is a line through the\r
origin in K2. If we take the unit sphere in each fiber, we get a bundle of (n − 1)-spheres over KP1\r
called the Hopf bundle:\r
pK: EK → KP1\r
The projection pK is called the Hopf map. The total space EK consists of all the unit vectors in\r
23

K2\r
, so it is a sphere of dimension 2n − 1. In short, the Hopf bundles look like this:\r
K = R : S\r
0\r
֒→ S\r
1 → S1\r
K = C : S\r
1\r
֒→ S\r
3 → S2\r
K = H : S\r
3\r
֒→ S\r
7 → S4\r
K = O : S\r
7\r
֒→ S\r
15 → S8\r
We can understand the Hopf maps better by thinking about inverse images of points. The inverse\r
image p\r
−1\r
K\r
(x) of any point x ∈ S\r
n\r
is a (n − 1)-sphere in S\r
2n−1\r
, and the inverse image of any pair\r
of distinct points is a pair of linked spheres of this sort. When K = C we get linked circles in S\r
3\r
,\r
which form the famous Hopf link:\r
When K = O, we get a pair of linked 7-spheres in S\r
15\r
.\r
To quantify this notion of linking, we can use the ‘Hopf invariant’. Suppose for a moment that\r
n is any natural number greater than one, and let f: S\r
2n−1 → Sn be any smooth map. If ω is the\r
normalized volume form on S\r
n, then f∗ω is a closed n-form on S2n−1\r
. Since the nth cohomology of\r
S\r
2n−1 vanishes, f∗ω = dα for some (n − 1)-form α. We define the Hopf invariant of f to be the\r
number\r
H(f) = Z\r
S2n−1\r
α ∧ dα.\r
This is easily seen to be invariant under smooth homotopies of the map f.\r
To see how the Hopf invariant is related to linking, we can compute it using homology rather than\r
cohomology. If we take any two regular values of f, say x and y, the inverse images of these points\r
are compact oriented (n−1)-dimensional submanifolds of S\r
2n−1\r
. We can always find an oriented n\u0002dimensional submanifold X ⊂ S\r
2n−1\r
that has boundary equal to f\r
−1\r
(x) and that intersects f\r
−1\r
(y)\r
transversely. The dimensions of X and f\r
−1\r
(y) add up to 2n−1, so their intersection number is well\u0002defined. By the duality between homology and cohomology, this number equals the Hopf invariant\r
H(f). This shows that the Hopf invariant is an integer. Moreover, it shows that when the Hopf\r
invariant is nonzero, the inverse images of x and y are linked.\r
Using either of these approaches we can compute the Hopf invariant of pC, pH and pO. They all\r
turn out to have Hopf invariant 1. This implies, for example, that the inverse images of distinct\r
points under pO are nontrivially linked 7-spheres in S\r
15. It also implies that pC, pH and pO give\r
nontrivial elements of π2n−1(S\r
n) for n = 2, 4, and 8. In fact, these elements generate the torsion-free\r
part of π2n−1(S\r
n\r
).\r
A deep study of the Hopf invariant is one way to prove that any division algebra must have\r
dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8. One can show that if there exists an n-dimensional division algebra, then\r
S\r
n−1 must be parallelizable: it must admit n − 1 pointwise linearly independent smooth vector\r
fields. One can also show that for n > 1, S\r
n−1\r
is parallelizable iff there exists a map f: S\r
2n−1 → Sn\r
with H(f) = 1 [3, 11, 62]. The hard part is showing that a map from S\r
2n−1\r
to S\r
n can have Hopf\r
invariant 1 only if n = 2, 4, or 8. This was proved by Adams sometime about 1958 [1].\r
3.2 OP1and Bott Periodicity\r
We already touched upon Bott periodicity when we mentioned that the Clifford algebra Cliffn+8\r
is isomorphic to the algebra of 16 × 16 matrices with entries lying in Cliffn. This is but one of\r
24

many related ‘period-8’ phenomena that go by the name of Bott periodicity. The appearance of\r
the number 8 here is no coincidence: all these phenomena are related to the octonions! Since this\r
marvelous fact is somewhat under-appreciated, it seems worthwhile to say a bit about it. Here we\r
shall focus on those aspects that are related to OP1and the canonical octonionic line bundle over\r
this space.\r
Let us start with K-theory. This is a way of gaining information about a topological space by\r
studying the vector bundles over it. If the space has holes in it, there will be nontrivial vector\r
bundles that have ‘twists’ as we go around these holes. The simplest example is the ‘M¨obius strip’\r
bundle over S\r
1\r
, a 1-dimensional real vector bundle which has a 180◦twist as we go around the circle.\r
In fact, this is just the canonical line bundle LR. The canonical line bundles LC, LH and LO provide\r
higher-dimensional analogues of this example.\r
K-theory tells us to study the vector bundles over a topological space X by constructing an\r
abelian group as follows. First, take the set consisting of all isomorphism classes of real vector\r
bundles over X. Our ability to take direct sums of vector bundles gives this set an ‘addition’\r
operation making it into a commutative monoid. Next, adjoin formal ‘additive inverses’ for all the\r
elements of this set, obtaining an abelian group. This group is called KO(X), the real K-theory\r
of X. Alternatively we could start with complex vector bundles and get a group called K(X), but\r
here we will be interested in real vector bundles.\r
Any real vector bundle E over X gives an element [E] ∈ KO(X), and these elements generate\r
this group. If we pick a point in X, there is an obvious homomorphism dim: KO(X) → Z sending\r
[E] to the dimension of the fiber of E at this point. Since the dimension is a rather obvious and\r
boring invariant of vector bundles, it is nice to work with the kernel of this homomorphism, which is\r
called the reduced real K-theory of X and denoted KOg(X). This is an invariant of pointed spaces,\r
i.e. spaces equipped with a designated point or basepoint.\r
Any sphere becomes a pointed space if we take the north pole as basepoint. The reduced real\r
K-theory of the first eight spheres looks like this:\r
KOg(S\r
1\r
) ∼= Z2\r
KOg(S\r
2\r
) ∼= Z2\r
KOg(S\r
3\r
) ∼= 0\r
KOg(S\r
4\r

As mentioned in the previous section, one can build any k-dimensional real vector bundle over\r
S\r
n using a map f: Sn−1 → O(k). In fact, isomorphism classes of such bundles are in one-to-one\r
correspondence with homotopy classes of such maps. Moreover, two such bundles determine the\r
same element of KOg(X) if and only if the corresponding maps become homotopy equivalent after\r
25

we compose them with the inclusion O(k) ֒→ O(∞), where O(∞) is the direct limit of the groups\r
O(k). It follows that\r
KOg(S\r
n\r
) ∼= πn−1(O(∞)).\r
This fact gives us the list of homotopy groups of O(∞) which appears in the Introduction. It also\r
means that to prove Bott periodicity for these homotopy groups:\r
πi+8(O(∞)) ∼= πi(O(∞)),\r
it suffices to prove Bott periodicity for real K-theory:\r
KOg(S\r
n+8) ∼= KOg(Sn\r
).\r
Why do we have Bott periodicity in real K-theory? It turns out that there is a graded ring KO\r
with\r
KOn = KOg(S\r
n\r
).\r
The product in this ring comes from our ability to take ‘smash products’ of spheres and also of real\r
vector bundles over these spheres. Multiplying by [LO] gives an isomorphism\r
KOg(S\r
n) → KOg(Sn+8)\r
x 7→ [LO] x\r
In other words, the canonical octonionic line bundle over OP1generates Bott periodicity!\r
There is much more to say about this fact and how it relates to Bott periodicity for Clifford\r
algebras, but alas, this would take us too far afield. We recommend that the interested reader turn\r
to some introductory texts on K-theory, for example the one by Dale Husemoller [56]. Unfortunately,\r
all the books I know downplay the role of the octonions. To spot it, one must bear in mind the\r
relation between the octonions and Clifford algebras, discussed in Section 2.3 above.\r
3.3 OP1and Lorentzian Geometry\r
In Section 3.1 we sketched a systematic approach to projective lines over the normed division alge\u0002bras. The most famous example is the Riemann sphere, CP1\r
. As emphasized by Penrose [77], this\r
space has a fascinating connection to Lorentzian geometry — or in other words, special relativity.\r
All conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere come from fractional linear transformations\r
z 7→\r
az + b\r
cz + d\r
, a, b, c, d ∈ C.\r
It is easy to see that the group of such transformations is isomorphic to PSL(2, C): 2 × 2 complex\r
matrices with determinant 1, modulo scalar multiples of the identity. Less obviously, it is also isomor\u0002phic to the Lorentz group SO0(3, 1): the identity component of the group of linear transformations\r
of R\r
4\r
that preserve the Minkowski metric\r
x · y = x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 − x4y4.\r
This fact has a nice explanation in terms of the ‘heavenly sphere’. Mathematically, this is the 2-\r
sphere consisting of all lines of the form {αx} where x ∈ R\r
4 has x · x = 0. In special relativity such\r
lines represent light rays, so the heavenly sphere is the sphere on which the stars appear to lie when\r
you look at the night sky. This sphere inherits a conformal structure from the Minkowski metric on\r
R\r
4\r
. This allows us to identify the heavenly sphere with CP1, and it implies that the Lorentz group\r
acts as conformal transformations of CP1. In concrete terms, what this means is that if you shoot\r
past the earth at nearly the speed of light, the constellations in the sky will appear distorted, but\r
all angles will be preserved.\r
26

In fact, these results are not special to the complex case: the same ideas work for the other\r
normed division algebras as well! The algebras R, C, H and O are related to Lorentzian geometry\r
in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions, respectively [68, 69, 70, 85, 93]. Even better, a full explanation of\r
this fact brings out new relationships between the normed division algebras and spinors. In what\r
follows we explain how this works for all 4 normed division algebras, with special attention to the\r
peculiarities of the octonionic case.\r
To set the stage, we first recall the most mysterious of the four infinite series of Jordan algebras\r
listed at the beginning of Section 3: the spin factors. We described these quite concretely, but a more\r
abstract approach brings out their kinship to Clifford algebras. Given an n-dimensional real inner\r
product space V , let the spin factor J(V ) be the Jordan algebra freely generated by V modulo\r
relations\r
v\r
2 = kvk2\r
.\r
Polarizing and applying the commutative law, we obtain\r
v ◦ w = hv, wi,\r
so J(V ) is isomorphic to V ⊕ R with the product\r
(v, α) ◦ (w, β) = (αw + βv,hv, wi + αβ).\r
Though Jordan algebras were invented to study quantum mechanics, the spin factors are also\r
deeply related to special relativity. We can think of J(V ) ∼= V ⊕ R as Minkowksi spacetime, with\r
V as space and R as time. The reason is that J(V ) is naturally equipped with a symmetric bilinear\r
form of signature (n, 1), the Minkowski metric:\r
(v, α) · (w, β) = hv, wi − αβ.\r
The group of linear transformations preserving the Minkowski metric is called O(n, 1), and the\r
identity component of this is called the Lorentz group, SO0(n, 1). We define the lightcone C(V )\r
to consist of all nonzero x ∈ J(V ) with x · x = 0. A 1-dimensional subspace of J(V ) spanned by an\r
element of the lightcone is called a light ray, and the space of all light rays is called the heavenly\r
sphere S(V ). We can identify the heavenly sphere with the unit sphere in V , since every light ray\r
is spanned by an element of the form (v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. Here is a picture of the\r
lightcone and the heavenly sphere when V is 2-dimensional:\r
C( ) V\r
S( ) V\r
V\r
When V is at least 2-dimensional, we can build a projective space from the Jordan algebra J(V ).\r
The result is none other than the heavenly sphere! To see this, note that aside from the elements 0\r
and 1, all projections in J(V ) are of the form p =\r
1\r
2\r
(v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. These are the\r
points of our projective space, but as we have seen, they also correspond to points of the heavenly\r
sphere. Our projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1 ∈ J(V ). We can\r
visualize this line as the heavenly sphere itself.\r
27

What does all this have to do with normed division algebras? To answer this, let K be a normed\r
division algebra of dimension n. Then the Jordan algebra h2(K) is secretly a spin factor! There is\r
an isomorphism\r
φ: h2(K) → J(K ⊕ R) ∼= K ⊕ R ⊕ R\r
given by\r
φ\r
\u0012\r
α + β x\r
x\r
∗ α − β\r
\u0013\r
= (x, β, α), x ∈ K, α, β ∈ R. (6)\r
Furthermore, the determinant of matrices in h2(K) is well-defined even when K is noncommutative\r
or nonassociative:\r
det \u0012\r
α + β x\r
x\r
∗ α − β\r
\u0013\r
= α\r
2 − β2 − kxk2\r
,\r
and clearly we have\r
det(a) = −φ(a) · φ(a)\r
for all a ∈ h2(K).\r
These facts have a number of nice consequences. First of all, since the Jordan algebras J(K ⊕ R)\r
and h2(K) are isomorphic, so are their associated projective spaces. We have seen that the former\r
space is the heavenly sphere S(K ⊕ R), and that the latter is KP1. It follows that\r
KP1 ∼= S(K ⊕ R).\r
This gives another proof of something we already saw in Section 3.1: KP1is an n-sphere. But it\r
shows more. The Lorentz group SO0(n+ 1, 1) has an obvious action on the heavenly sphere, and the\r
usual conformal structure on the sphere is invariant under this action. Using the above isomorphism\r
we can transfer this group action and invariant conformal structure to KP1in a natural way.\r
Secondly, it follows that the determinant-preserving linear transformations of h2(K) form a group\r
isomorphic to O(n + 1, 1). How can we find some transformations of this sort? If K = R, this is\r
easy: when g ∈ SL(2, R) and x ∈ h2(R), we again have gxg∗ ∈ h2(R), and\r
det(gxg∗) = det(x).\r
This gives a homomorphism from SL(2, R) to O(2, 1). This homomorphism is two–to–one, since\r
both g = 1 and g = −1 act trivially, and it maps SL(2, R) onto the identity component of O(2, 1). It\r
follows that SL(2, R) is a double cover of SO0(2, 1). The exact same construction works for K = C,\r
so SL(2, C) is a double cover of SO0(3, 1).\r
For the other two normed division algebras the above calculation involving determinants breaks\r
down, and it even becomes tricky to define the group SL(2, K), so we start by working at the Lie\r
algebra level. We say a m × m matrix with entries in the normed division algebra K is traceless if\r
the sum of its diagonal entries is zero. Any such traceless matrix acts as a real–linear operator on\r
Km. When K is commutative and associative, the space of operators coming from m × m traceless\r
matrices with entries in K is closed under commutators, but otherwise it is not, so we define sl(m, K)\r
to be the Lie algebra of operators on Km generated by operators of this form. This Lie algebra in\r
turn generates a Lie group of real-linear operators on Km, which we call SL(m, K). Note that\r
multiplication in this group is given by composition of real-linear operators, which is associative\r
even for K = O.\r
The Lie algebra sl(m, K) comes born with a representation: its fundamental representation\r
as real-linear operators on Km, given by\r
a: x 7→ ax, x ∈ K\r
m\r
whenever a ∈ sl(m, K) actually corresponds to a traceless m×m matrix with entries in K. Tensoring\r
the fundamental representation with its dual, we get a representation of sl(m, K) on the space of\r
matrices K[m], given by\r
a: x 7→ ax + xa∗, x ∈ K[m]\r
28

whenever a is a traceless matrix with entries in K. Since ax + xa∗\r
is hermitian whenever x is, this\r
representation restricts to a representation of sl(m, K) on hm(K). This in turn can be exponentiated\r
to obtain a representation of the group SL(m, K) on hm(K).\r
Now let us return to the case m = 2. One can prove that the representation of SL(2, K) on h2(K)\r
is determinant-preserving simply by checking that\r
d\r
dt det(x + t(ax + xa∗\r
))\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
t=0\r
= 0\r
when x lies in h2(K) and a ∈ K[2] is traceless. Here the crucial thing is to make sure that the\r
calculation is not spoiled by noncommutativity or nonassociativity. It follows that we have a homo\u0002morphism\r
αK: SL(2, K) → SO0(n + 1, 1)\r
One can check that this is onto, and that its kernel consists of the matrices ±1. Thus if we define\r
PSL(2, K) = SL(2, K)/{±1},\r
we get isomorphisms\r
PSL(2, R) ∼= SO0(2, 1)\r
PSL(2, C) ∼= SO0(3, 1)\r
PSL(2, H) ∼= SO0(6, 1)\r
PSL(2, O) ∼= SO0(9, 1).\r
Putting this together with our earlier observations, it follows that PSL(2, K) acts as conformal\r
transformations of KP1.\r
We conclude with some words about how all this relates to spinors. The machinery of Clifford\r
algebras and spinors extends effortlessly from the case of inner product spaces to vector spaces\r
equipped with an indefinite metric. In particular, the Lorentz group SO0(n + 1, 1) has a double\r
cover called Spin(n + 1, 1), and this group has certain representations called spinor representations.\r
When n = 1, 2, 4 or 8, we actually have\r
Spin(n + 1, 1) ∼= SL(2, K)\r
where K is the normed division algebra of dimension n. The fundamental representation of SL(2, K)\r
on K2is the left-handed spinor representation of Spin(n + 1, 1). Its dual is the right-handed spinor\r
representation. Moreover, the interaction between vectors and spinors that serves as the basis of\r
supersymmetric theories of physics in spacetimes of dimension 3, 4, 6 and 10 is just the action of\r
h2(K) on K2 by matrix multiplication. In a Feynman diagram, this is represented as follows:\r
K2\r
h2(K)\r
K2\r
In the case K = C, Penrose [77] has described a nice trick for getting points on the heavenly\r
sphere from spinors. In fact, it also works for other normed division algebras: if (x, y) ∈ K2is\r
nonzero, the hermitian matrix\r
\u0012\r
x\r
y\r
\u0013\r
\r
x\r
∗ y∗\r

\u0012\r
xx∗ xy∗\r
yx∗ yy∗\r
\u0013\r
29

is nonzero but has determinant zero, so it defines a point on the heavenly sphere. If we restrict to\r
spinors of norm one, this trick reduces to the Hopf map. Moreover, it clarifies the curious double role\r
of KP1as both the heavenly sphere in special relativity and a space of propositions in the quantum\r
logic associated to the Jordan algebra h2(K): any point on the heavenly sphere corresponds to a\r
proposition specifying the state of a spinor!\r
3.4 OP2and the Exceptional Jordan Algebra\r
The octonions are fascinating in themselves, but the magic really starts when we use them to\r
construct the exceptional Jordan algebra h3(O) and its associated projective space, the octonionic\r
projective plane. The symmetry groups of these structures turn out to be exceptional Lie groups, and\r
triality gains an eerie pervasive influence over the proceedings, since an element of h3(O) consists of\r
3 octonions and 3 real numbers. Using the relation between normed division algebras and trialities,\r
we get an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R\r
3 ⊕ V8 ⊕ S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
\r
\r
α z∗ y\r
∗\r
z β x\r
y x∗ γ\r
\r
 7→ ((α, β, γ), x, y, z)\r
(7)\r
where α, β, γ ∈ R and x, y, z ∈ O. Examining the Jordan product in h3(O) then reveals a wonderful\r
fact: while superficially this product is defined using the ∗-algebra structure of O, it can actually be\r
defined using only the natural maps\r
V8 × S\r
+\r
8 → S\r
−\r
8\r
, V8 × S\r
−\r
8 → S\r
+\r
8\r
, S+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → V8\r
together with the inner products on these 3 spaces. All this information is contained in the normed\r
triality\r
t8: V8 × S\r
+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → R,\r
so any automorphism of this triality gives a automorphism of h3(O). In Section 2.4 we saw that\r
Aut(t8) ∼= Spin(8). With a little thought, it follows that\r
Spin(8) ⊆ Aut(h3(O)).\r
However, this picture of h3(O) in terms of 8-dimensional Euclidean geometry is just part of a\r
bigger picture — a picture set in 10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime! If we regard h2(O) as sitting\r
in the lower right-hand corner of h3(O), we get an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R ⊕ h2(O) ⊕ O2\r
\u0012\r
α ψ∗\r
ψ a \u0013\r
7→ (α, a, ψ)\r
(8)\r
We saw in Section 3.3 that a ∈ h2(O) and ψ ∈ O2can be identified with a vector and a spinor in\r
10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, respectively. Similarly, α is a scalar.\r
This picture gives a representation of Spin(9, 1) as linear transformations of h3(O). Unfortunately,\r
most of these transformations do not preserve the Jordan product on h3(O). As we shall see, they\r
only preserve a lesser structure on h3(O): the determinant. However, the transformations coming\r
from the subgroup Spin(9) ⊂ Spin(9, 1) do preserve the Jordan product. We can see this as follows.\r
As a representation of Spin(9), h2(O) splits into ‘space’ and ‘time’:\r
h2(O) ∼= V9 ⊕ R\r
30

with the two pieces corresponding to the traceless elements of h2(O) and the real multiples of the\r
identity, respectively. On the other hand, the spinor representation of so(9) splits as S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8 when\r
we restrict it to so(8), so we have\r
O\r
2 ∼= S9.\r
We thus obtain an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R\r
2 ⊕ V9 ⊕ S9\r
\u0012\r
α ψ∗\r
ψ a + β\r
\u0013\r
7→ ((α, β), a, ψ)\r
(9)\r
where a ∈ h2(O) has vanishing trace and β is a real multiple of the identity. In these terms, one can\r
easily check that the Jordan product in h3(O) is built from invariant operations on scalars, vectors\r
and spinors in 9 dimensions. It follows that\r
Spin(9) ⊆ Aut(h3(O)).\r
For more details on this, see Harvey’s book [54].\r
This does not exhaust all the symmetries of h3(O), since there are other automorphisms coming\r
from the permutation group on 3 letters, which acts on (α, β, γ) ∈ R\r
3 and (x, y, z) ∈ O3\r
in an\r
obvious way. Also, any matrix g ∈ O(3) acts by conjugation as an automorphism of h3(O); since\r
the entries of g are real, there is no problem with nonassociativity here. The group Spin(9) is 36-\r
dimensional, but the full automorphism group h3(O) is much bigger: it is 52-dimensional. As we\r
explain in Section 4.2, it goes by the name of F4.\r
However, we can already do something interesting with the automorphisms we have: we can use\r
them to diagonalize any element of h3(O). To see this, first note that the rotation group, and thus\r
Spin(9), acts transitively on the unit sphere in V9. This means we can use an automorphism in our\r
Spin(9) subgroup to bring any element of h3(O) to the form\r
\r
\r
α z∗y\r
∗\r
z β x\r
y x∗ γ\r
\r
\r
where x is real. The next step is to apply an automorphism that makes y and z real while leaving x\r
alone. To do this, note that the subgroup of Spin(9) fixing any nonzero vector in V9 is isomorphic\r
to Spin(8). When we restrict the representation S9 to this subgroup, it splits as S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
, and with\r
some work [54] one can show that Spin(8) acts on S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
∼= O2\r
in such a way that any element\r
(y, z) ∈ O2can be carried to an element with both components real. The final step is to take our\r
element of h3(O) with all real entries and use an automorphism to diagonalize it. We can do this by\r
conjugating it with a suitable matrix in O(3).\r
To understand OP2, we need to understand projections in h3(O). Here is where our ability\r
to diagonalize matrices in h3(O) via automorphisms comes in handy. Up to automorphism, every\r
projection in h3(O) looks like one of these four:\r
p0 =\r
\r
\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p1 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p2 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 1 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p3 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 1 0\r
0 0 1\r
\r
 .\r
Now, the trace of a matrix in h3(O) is invariant under automorphisms, because we can define it\r
using only the Jordan algebra structure:\r
tr(a) = 1\r
9\r
tr(La), a ∈ h3(O)\r
31

where La is left multiplication by a. It follows that the trace of any projection in h3(O) is 0,1,2, or\r
3. Furthermore, the rank of any projection p ∈ h3(O) equals its trace. To see this, first note that\r
tr(p) ≥ rank(p), since p < q implies tr(p) < tr(q), and the trace goes up by integer steps. Thus we\r
only need show tr(p) ≤ rank(p). For this it suffices to consider the four projections shown above, as\r
both trace and rank are invariant under automorphisms. Since p0 < p1 < p2 < p3, it is clear that\r
for these projections we indeed have tr(p) ≤ rank(p).\r
It follows that the points of the octonionic projective plane are projections with trace 1 in h3(O),\r
while the lines are projections with trace 2. A calculation [54] shows that any projection with trace\r
1 has the form\r
p =\r
\r
\r
x\r
y\r
z\r
\r
\r
\r
x\r
∗ y∗\r
z\r
∗\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
\r
xx∗ xy∗ xz∗\r
yx∗ yy∗ yz∗\r
zx∗zy∗zz∗\r
\r
 (10)\r
where (x, y, z) ∈ O3 has\r
(xy)z = x(yz), kxk\r
2 + kyk2 + kzk2 = 1.\r
On the other hand, any projection with trace 2 is of the form 1 − p where p has trace 1. This sets\r
up a one-to-one correspondence between points and lines in the octonionic projective plane. If we\r
use this correspondence to think of both as trace-1 projections, the point p lies on the line p\r
′\r
if\r
and only if p < 1 − p\r
′\r
. Of course, p < 1 − p\r
′\r
iff p\r
′ < 1 − p. The symmetry of this relation means\r
the octonionic projective plane is self-dual! This is also true of the real, complex and quaternionic\r
projective planes. In all cases, the operation that switches points and lines corresponds in quantum\r
logic to the ‘negation’ of propositions [98].\r
We use OP2to stand for the set of points in the octonionic projective plane. Given any nonzero\r
element (x, y, z) ∈ O3 with (xy)z = x(yz), we can normalize it and then use equation (10) to obtain\r
a point [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2. Copying the strategy that worked for OP1, we can make OP2into a smooth\r
manifold by covering it with three coordinate charts:\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(x, y, 1)],\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(x, 1, z)],\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(1, y, z)].\r
Checking that this works is a simple calculation. The only interesting part is to make sure that\r
whenever the associative law might appear necessary, we can either use the alternativity of the\r
octonions or the fact that only triples with (xy)z = x(yz) give points [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2.\r
We thus obtain the following picture of the octonionic projective plane. As a manifold, OP2is\r
16-dimensional. The lines in OP2are copies of OP1, and thus 8-spheres. For any two distinct points\r
in OP2, there is a unique line on which they both lie. For any two distinct lines, there is a unique\r
point lying on both of them. There is a ‘duality’ transformation that maps points to lines and vice\r
versa while preserving this incidence relation. In particular, since the space of all points lying on\r
any given line is a copy of OP1, so is the space of all lines containing a given point!\r
To dig more deeply into the geometry of OP2one needs another important structure on the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra: the determinant. We saw in Section 3.3 that despite noncommutativity\r
and nonassociativity, the determinant of a matrix in h2(O) is a well-defined and useful concept. The\r
same holds for h3(O)! We can define the determinant of a matrix in h3(O) by\r
det\r
\r
\r
α z∗ y\r
∗\r
z β x\r
y x∗ γ\r
\r
 = αβγ − (αkxk\r
2 + βkyk2 + γkzk2\r
) + 2Re(xyz).\r
We can express this in terms of the trace and product via\r
det(a) = 1\r
3\r
tr(a\r
3\r
) −\r
1\r
2\r
tr(a\r
2\r
)tr(a) + 1\r
6\r
tr(a)\r
3\r
.\r
32

This shows that the determinant is invariant under all automorphisms of h3(O). However, the\r
determinant is invariant under an even bigger group of linear transformations. As we shall see in\r
Section 4.4, this group is 78-dimensional: it is a noncompact real form of the exceptional Lie group\r
E6. This extra symmetry makes it worth seeing how much geometry we can do starting with just\r
the determinant and the vector space structure of h3(O).\r
The determinant is a cubic form on h3(O), so there is a unique symmetric trilinear form\r
(·, ·, ·): h3(O) × h3(O) × h3(O) → R\r
such that\r
(a, a, a) = det(a).\r
By dualizing this, we obtain the so-called cross product\r
×: h3(O) × h3(O) → h3(O)\r
∗\r
.\r
Explicitly, this is given by\r
(a × b)(c) = (a, b, c).\r
Despite its name, this product is commutative.\r
We have already seen that points of OP2correspond to trace-1 projections in h3(O). Freudenthal\r
[40] noticed that these are the same as elements p ∈ h3(O) with tr(p) = 1 and p × p = 0. Even\r
better, we can drop the equation tr(p) = 1 as long as we promise to work with equivalence classes of\r
nonzero elements satisfying p×p = 0, where two such elements are equivalent when one is a nonzero\r
real multiple of the other. Each such equivalence class [p] corresponds to a unique point of OP2, and\r
we get all the points this way.\r
Given two points [p] and [q], their cross product p×q is well-defined up to a nonzero real multiple.\r
This suggests that we define a ‘line’ to be an equivalence class of elements p×q ∈ h3(O)\r
∗\r
, where again\r
two such elements are deemed equivalent if one is a nonzero real multiple of the other. Freudenthal\r
showed that we get a projective plane isomorphic to OP2if we take these as our definitions of points\r
and lines and decree that the point [p] lies on the line [L] if and only if L(p) = 0. Note that this\r
equation makes sense even though L and p are only well-defined up to nonzero real multiples.\r
One consequence of all this is that one can recover the structure of OP2as a projective plane\r
starting from just the determinant on h3(O): we did not need the Jordan algebra structure! However,\r
to get a ‘duality’ map switching points and lines while preserving the incidence relation, we need a\r
bit more: we need the nondegenerate pairing\r
ha, bi = tr(ab)\r
on h3(O). This sets up an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= h3(O)\r
∗\r
.\r
This isomorphism turns out to map points to lines, and in fact, it sets up a one-to-one correspondence\r
between points and lines. We can use this correspondence to think of both points and lines in\r
OP2as equivalence classes of elements of h3(O). In these terms, the point p lies on the line ℓ iff\r
hℓ, pi = 0. This relationship is symmetrical! It follows that if we switch points and lines using this\r
correspondence, the incidence relation is preserved.\r
We thus obtain a very pretty setup for working with OP2. If we use the isomorphism between\r
h3(O) and its dual to reinterpret the cross product as a map\r
×: h3(O) × h3(O) → h3(O),\r
then not only is the line through distinct points [p] and [q] given by [p × q], but also the point in\r
which two distinct lines [ℓ] and [m] meet is given by [ℓ × m]. A triple of points [p], [q] and [r] is\r
33

collinear iff (p, q, r) = 0, and a triple of lines [ℓ], [m], [n] meets at a point iff (ℓ, m, n) = 0. In\r
addition, there is a delightful bunch of identities relating the Jordan product, the determinant, the\r
cross product and the inner product in h3(O).\r
For more on octonionic geometry, the reader is urged to consult the original papers by Freudenthal\r
[39, 40, 41, 42], Jacques Tits [94, 95] and Tonny Springer [87, 88, 89]. The book by Helmut Salzmann\r
et al is also good [82]. Unfortunately, we must now bid goodbye to this subject and begin our trip\r
through the exceptional groups. However, we shall return to study the symmetries of OP2and the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra in Sections 4.2 and 4.4.\r
4 Exceptional Lie Algebras\r
On October 18th, 1887, Wilhelm Killing wrote a letter to Friedrich Engel saying that he had classified\r
the simple Lie algebras. In the next three years, this revolutionary work was published in a series of\r
papers [63]. Besides what we now call the ‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, he claimed to have found\r
6 ‘exceptional’ ones — new mathematical objects whose existence had never before been suspected.\r
In fact he gave a rigorous construction of only the smallest of these. In his 1894 thesis, Cartan [14]\r
constructed all of them and noticed that the two 52-dimensional exceptional Lie algebras discovered\r
by Killing were isomorphic, so that there are really only 5.\r
The Killing-Cartan classification of simple Lie algebras introduced much of the technology that\r
is now covered in any introductory course on the subject, such as roots and weights. In what follows\r
we shall avoid this technology, since we wish instead to see the exceptional Lie algebras as octonionic\r
relatives of the classical ones — slightly eccentric relatives, but still having a close connection to\r
geometry, in particular the Riemannian geometry of projective planes. It is also for this reason that\r
we shall focus on the compact real forms of the simple Lie algebras.\r
The classical simple Lie algebras can be organized in three infinite families:\r
so(n) = {x ∈ R[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},\r
su(n) = {x ∈ C[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},\r
sp(n) = {x ∈ H[n]: x\r
∗ = −x}.\r
The corresponding Lie groups are\r
SO(n) = {x ∈ R[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},\r
SU(n) = {x ∈ C[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},\r
Sp(n) = {x ∈ H[n]: xx∗ = 1}.\r
These arise naturally as symmetry groups of projective spaces over R, C, and H, respectively. More\r
precisely, they arise as groups of isometries: transformations that preserve a specified Riemannian\r
metric. Let us sketch how this works, as a warmup for the exceptional groups.\r
First consider the projective space RPn. We can think of this as the unit sphere in R\r
n+1 with\r
antipodal points x and −x identified. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric from the sphere, and\r
the obvious action of the rotation group O(n + 1) as isometries of the sphere yields an action of this\r
group as isometries of RPn with this metric. In fact, with this metric, the group of all isometries of\r
RPnis just\r
Isom(RPn) ∼= O(n + 1)/O(1)\r
where O(1) = {±1} is the subgroup of O(n + 1) that acts trivially on RPn. The Lie algebra of this\r
isometry group is\r
isom(RPn) ∼= so(n + 1).\r
The case of CPnis very similar. We can think of this as the unit sphere in C\r
n+1 with points\r
x and αx identified whenever α is a unit complex number. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric\r
34

from this sphere, and the unitary group U(n + 1) acts as isometries. If we consider only the con\u0002nected component of the isometry group and ignore the orientation-reversing isometries coming from\r
complex conjugation, we have\r
Isom0(CPn) ∼= U(n + 1)/U(1)\r
where U(1) is the subgroup that acts trivially on CPn. The Lie algebra of this isometry group is\r
isom(CPn) ∼= su(n + 1).\r
The case of HPnis subtler, since we must take the noncommutativity of the quaternions into\r
account. We can think of HPnas the unit sphere in Hn+1 with points x and αx identified whenever\r
α is a unit quaternion, and as before, HPninherits a Riemannian metric. The group Sp(n + 1) acts\r
as isometries of HPn, but this action comes from right multiplication, so\r
Isom(HPn) ∼= Sp(n + 1)/{±1},\r
since not Sp(1) but only its center {±1} acts trivially on HPnby right multiplication. At the Lie\r
algebra level, this gives\r
isom(HPn) ∼= sp(n + 1).\r
For lovers of the octonions, it is tempting to try a similar construction starting with OP2. While\r
nonassociativity makes things a bit tricky, we show in Section 4.2 that it can in fact be done. It\r
turns out that Isom(OP2) is one of the exceptional Lie groups, namely F4. Similarly, the exceptional\r
Lie groups E6, E7 and E8 are in a certain subtle sense the isometry groups of projective planes over\r
the algebras C ⊗ O, H ⊗ O and O ⊗ O. Together with F4, these groups can all be defined by the\r
so-called ‘magic square’ construction, which makes use of much of the algebra we have described so\r
far. We explain three versions of this construction in Section 4.3. We then treat the groups E6,E7\r
and E8 individually in the following sections. But first, we must introduce G2: the smallest of the\r
exceptional Lie groups, and none other than the automorphism group of the octonions.\r
4.1 G2\r
In 1914, Elie Cartan noted that the smallest of the exceptional Lie gr ´ oups, G2, is the automorphism\r
group of the octonions [15]. Its Lie algebra g2 is therefore der(O), the derivations of the octonions.\r
Let us take these facts as definitions of G2 and its Lie algebra, and work out some of the consequences.\r
What are automorphisms of the octonions like? One way to analyze this involves subalgebras of\r
the octonions. Any octonion e1 whose square is −1 generates a subalgebra of O isomorphic to C.\r
If we then pick any octonion e2 with square equal to −1 that anticommutes with e1, the elements\r
e1, e2 generate a subalgebra isomorphic to H. Finally, if we pick any octonion e3 with square equal\r
to −1 that anticommutes with e1, e2, and e1e2, the elements e1, e2, e3 generate all of O. We call\r
such a triple of octonions a basic triple. Given any basic triple, there exists a unique way to define\r
e4, . . ., e7 so that the whole multiplication table in Section 2 holds. In fact, this follows from the\r
remarks on the Cayley–Dickson construction at the end of Section 2.3.\r
It follows that given any two basic triples, there exists a unique automorphism of O mapping\r
the first to the second. Conversely, it is obvious that any automorphism maps basic triples to basic\r
triples. This gives a nice description of the group G2, as follows.\r
Fix a basic triple e1, e2, e3. There is a unique automorphism of the octonions mapping this to\r
any other basic triple, say e\r
′\r
1\r
, e′\r
2\r
, e′\r
3\r
. Now our description of basic triples so far has been purely\r
algebraic, but we can also view them more geometrically as follows: a basic triple is any triple of\r
unit imaginary octonions (i.e. imaginary octonions of norm one) such that each is orthogonal to the\r
algebra generated by the other two. This means that our automorphism can map e1 to any point\r
e\r
′\r
1\r
on the 6-sphere of unit imaginary octonions, then map e2 to any point e\r
′\r
2\r
on the 5-sphere of unit\r
35

imaginary octonions that are orthogonal to e\r
′\r
1\r
, and then map e3 to any point e\r
′\r
3\r
on the 3-sphere of\r
unit imaginary octonions that are orthogonal to e\r
′\r
1\r
, e′\r
2 and e\r
′\r
1\r
e\r
′\r
2\r
. It follows that\r
dim G2 = dim S\r
6 + dim S5 + dim S3 = 14.\r
The triality description of the octonions in Section 2.4 gives another picture of G2. First, recall\r
that Spin(8) is the automorphism group of the triality t8: V8 × S\r
+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → R. To construct the\r
octonions from this triality we need to pick unit vectors in any two of these spaces, so we can think\r
of G2 as the subgroup of Spin(8) fixing unit vectors in V8 and S\r
+\r
8\r
. The subgroup of Spin(8) fixing\r
a unit vector in V8 is just Spin(7), and when we restrict the representation S\r
+\r
8\r
to Spin(7), we get\r
the spinor representation S7. Thus G2 is the subgroup of Spin(7) fixing a unit vector in S7. Since\r
Spin(7) acts transitively on the unit sphere S\r
7\r
in this spinor representation [2], we have\r
Spin(7)/G2 = S\r
7\r
.\r
It follows that\r
dim G2 = dim(Spin(7)) − dim S\r
7 = 21 − 7 = 14.\r
This picture becomes a bit more vivid if we remember that after choosing unit vectors in V8\r
and S\r
+\r
8\r
, we can identify both these representations with the octonions, with both unit vectors\r
corresponding to 1 ∈ O. Thus what we are really saying is this: the subgroup of Spin(8) that fixes\r
1 in the vector representation on O is Spin(7); the subgroup that fixes 1 in both the vector and\r
right-handed spinor representations is G2. This subgroup also fixes the element 1 in the left-handed\r
spinor representation of Spin(8) on O.\r
Now, using the vector representation of Spin(8) on O, we get homomorphisms\r
G2 ֒→ Spin(8) → SO(O)\r
where SO(O) ∼= SO(8) is the rotation group of the octonions, viewed as a real vector space with\r
the inner product hx, yi = Re(x\r
∗y). The map from Spin(8) to SO(O) is two-to-one, but when we\r
restrict it to G2 we get a one-to-one map\r
G2 ֒→ SO(O).\r
At the Lie algebra level, this construction gives an inclusion\r
g2 ֒→ so(O)\r
where so(O) ∼= so(8) is the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the octonions.\r
Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(O) is 28-dimensional, it is nice to see exactly where the extra\r
14 dimensions come from. In fact, they come from two copies of Im(O), the 7-dimensional space\r
consisting of all imaginary octonions.\r
More precisely, we have:\r
so(O) = g2 ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O) (11)\r
(a direct sum of vector spaces, not Lie algebras), where LIm(O)is the space of linear transformations\r
of O given by left multiplication by imaginary octonions and RIm(O)\r
is the space of linear transfor\u0002mations of O given by right multiplication by imaginary octonions [84]. To see this, we first check\r
that left multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. Using polarization, it suffices to\r
note that\r
hx, axi = Re(x\r
∗\r
(ax)) = Re((x\r
∗\r
a)x) = Re((a\r
∗x)∗x) = −Re((ax)∗x) = −hax, xi\r
for all a ∈ Im(O) and x ∈ O. Note that this calculation only uses the alternative law, not the\r
associative law, since x, x∗ and a all lie in the algebra generated by the two elements a and Im(x).\r
36

A similar argument shows that right multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. It\r
follows that g2, LIm(O) and RIm(O) all naturally lie in so(8). Next, with some easy calculations we\r
can check that\r
LIm(O) ∩ RIm(O) = {0}\r
and\r
g2 ∩ (LIm(O) + RIm(O)) = {0}.\r
Using the fact that the dimensions of the 3 pieces adds to 28, equation (11) follows.\r
We have seen that G2 sits inside SO(8), but we can do better: it actually sits inside SO(7). After\r
all, every automorphism of the octonions fixes the identity, and thus preserves the space of octonions\r
orthogonal to the identity. This space is just Im(O), so we have an inclusion\r
G2 ֒→ SO(Im(O))\r
where SO(Im(O)) ∼= SO(7) is the rotation group of the imaginary octonions. At the Lie algebra\r
level this gives an inclusion\r
g2 ֒→ so(Im(O)).\r
Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(Im(O)) is 21-dimensional, it is nice to see where the 7 extra\r
dimensions come from. Examining equation (11), it is clear that these extra dimensions must come\r
from the transformations in LIm(O) ⊕RIm(O) that annihilate the identity 1 ∈ O. The transformations\r
that do this are precisely those of the form\r
ada = La − Ra\r
for a ∈ Im(O). We thus have\r
so(Im(O)) ∼= der(O) ⊕ adIm(O) (12)\r
where adIm(O)is the 7-dimensional space of such transformations.\r
We may summarize some of the above results as follows:\r
Theorem 4. The compact real form of the Lie algebra g2 is given by\r
g2 = der(O) ⊂ so(Im(O)) ⊂ so(O)\r
and we have\r
so(Im(O)) = der(O) ⊕ adIm(O)\r
so(O) = der(O) ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O)\r
where the Lie brackets in so(Im(O)) and so(O) are built from natural bilinear operations on the\r
summands.\r
As we have seen, G2 has a 7-dimensional representation Im(O). In fact, this is the smallest\r
nontrivial representation of G2, so it is worth understanding in as many ways as possible. The\r
space Im(O) has at least three natural structures that are preserved by the transformations in G2.\r
These give more descriptions of G2 as a symmetry group, and they also shed some new light on the\r
octonions. The first two of the structures we describe are analogous to more familiar ones that exist\r
on the 3-dimensional space of imaginary quaternions, Im(H). The third makes explicit use of the\r
nonassociativity of the octonions.\r
First, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the commutator. In the case of Im(H), the\r
commutator divided by 2 is the familiar cross product in 3 dimensions:\r
a × b =\r
1\r
2\r
[a, b].\r
37

We can make the same definition for Im(O), obtaining a 7-dimensional analog of the cross product.\r
For both Im(H) and Im(O) the cross product is bilinear and anticommutative. The cross product\r
makes Im(H) into a Lie algebra, but not Im(O). For both Im(H) and Im(O), the cross product has\r
two nice geometrical properties. On the one hand, its norm is determined by the formula\r
ka × bk\r
2 + ha, bi2 = kak2\r
kbk\r
2\r
,\r
or equivalently,\r
ka × bk = |sin θ| kak kbk,\r
where θ is the angle between a and b. On the other hand, a × b is orthogonal to a and b. Both these\r
properties follow from easy calculations. For Im(H), these two properties are enough to determine\r
x × y up to a sign. For Im(O) they are not — but they become so if we also use the fact that x × y\r
lies inside a copy of Im(H) that contains x and y.\r
It is clear that the group of all real-linear transformations of Im(H) preserving the cross product\r
is just SO(3), which is also the automorphism group of the quaternions. One can similarly show\r
that the group of real-linear transformations of Im(O) preserving the cross product is exactly G2.\r
To see this, start by noting that any element of G2 preserves the cross product on Im(O), since the\r
cross product is defined using octonion multiplication. To show that conversely any transformation\r
preserving the cross product lies in G2, it suffices to express the multiplication of imaginary octonions\r
in terms of their cross product. Using this identity:\r
a × b = ab + ha, bi,\r
it actually suffices to express the inner product on Im(O) in terms of the cross product. Here the\r
following identity does the job:\r
ha, bi = −1\r
6\r
tr(a × (b × ·)) (13)\r
where the right-hand side refers to the trace of the map\r
a × (b × ·): Im(O) → Im(O).\r
Second, both Im(H) and Im(O) are equipped with a natural 3-form, or in other words, an\r
alternating trilinear functional. This is given by\r
φ(x, y, z) = hx, yzi.\r
In the case of Im(H) this is just the usual volume form, and the group of real-linear transformations\r
preserving it is SL(3, R). In the case of Im(O), the real-linear transformations preserving φ are\r
exactly those in the group G2. A proof of this by Robert Bryant can be found in Reese Harvey’s\r
book [54]. The 3-form φ is important in the theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’ [60], which are 7-dimensional\r
Riemannian manifolds with holonomy group equal to G2.\r
Third, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the associator. For Im(H) this is boring, since\r
the associator vanishes. On the other hand, for Im(O) the associator is interesting. In fact, it\r
follows from results of Harvey [54] that a real-linear transformation T : Im(O) → Im(O) preserves\r
the associator if and only if ±T lies in G2. Thus the symmetry group of the associator is slightly\r
bigger than G2: it is G2 × Z2.\r
Now we must make an embarrassing admission: these three structures on Im(O) are all almost\r
the same thing! Starting with the cross product\r
×: Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O)\r
we can recover the usual inner product on Im(O) by equation (13). This inner product allows us\r
to dualize the cross product and obtain a trilinear functional, which is, up to a constant, just the\r
3-form\r
φ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.\r
38

The cross product also determines an orientation on Im(O) (we leave this as an exercise for the\r
reader). This allows us to take the Hodge dual of φ, obtaining a 4-form ψ, i.e. an alternating\r
tetralinear functional\r
ψ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.\r
Dualizing yet again, this gives a ternary operation which, up to a constant multiple, is the associator:\r
[·, ·, ·]: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O).\r
We conclude this section with a handy explicit formula for all the derivations of the octonions.\r
In an associative algebra A, any element x defines an inner derivation adx: A → A by\r
adx(a) = [x, a]\r
where the bracket denotes the commutator xa−ax. In a nonassociative algebra, this formula usually\r
does not define a derivation. However, if A is alternative, any pair of elements x, y ∈ A define a\r
derivation Dx,y: A → A by\r
Dx,ya = [[x, y], a] − 3[x, y, a] (14)\r
where [a, b, x] denotes the associator (ab)x − a(bx). Moreover, when A is a normed division algebra,\r
every derivation is a linear combination of derivations of this form. Unfortunately, proving these\r
facts seems to require some brutal calculations [84].\r
4.2 F4\r
The second smallest of the exceptional Lie groups is the 52-dimensional group F4. The geometric\r
meaning of this group became clear in a number of nearly simultaneous papers by various mathe\u0002maticians. In 1949, Jordan constructed the octonionic projective plane using projections in h3(O).\r
One year later, Armand Borel [10] noted that F4 is the isometry group of a 16-dimensional projec\u0002tive plane. In fact, this plane is none other than than OP2\r
. Also in 1950, Claude Chevalley and\r
Richard Schafer [21] showed that F4 is the automorphism group of h3(O). In 1951, Freudenthal\r
[39] embarked upon a long series of papers in which he described not only F4 but also the other\r
exceptional Lie groups using octonionic projective geometry. To survey these developments, one still\r
cannot do better than to read his classic 1964 paper on Lie groups and the foundations of geometry\r
[42].\r
Let us take Chevalley and Schafer’s result as the definition of F4:\r
F4 = Aut(h3(O)).\r
Its Lie algebra is thus\r
f4 = der(h3(O)).\r
As we saw in Section 3.4, points of OP2correspond to trace-1 projections in the exceptional Jordan\r
algebra. It follows that F4 acts as transformations of OP2. In fact, we can equip OP2 with a\r
Riemannian metric for which F4 is the isometry group. To get a sense of how this works, let us\r
describe OP2as a quotient space of F4.\r
In Section 3.4 we saw that the exceptional Jordan algebra can be built using natural operations\r
on the scalar, vector and spinor representations of Spin(9). This implies that Spin(9) is a subgroup\r
of F4. Equation (9) makes it clear that Spin(9) is precisely the subgroup fixing the element\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 .\r
39

Since this element is a trace-one projection, it corresponds to a point of OP2\r
. We have already seen\r
that F4 acts transitively on OP2. It follows that\r
OP2 ∼= F4/Spin(9). (15)\r
This fact has various nice spinoffs. First, it gives an easy way to compute the dimension of F4:\r
dim(F4) = dim(Spin(9)) + dim(OP2) = 36 + 16 = 52.\r
Second, since F4 is compact, we can take any Riemannian metric on OP2and average it with respect\r
to the action of this group. The isometry group of the resulting metric will automatically include\r
F4 as a subgroup. With more work [6], one can show that actually\r
F4 = Isom(OP2)\r
and thus\r
f4 = isom(OP2).\r
Equation (15) also implies that the tangent space of our chosen point in OP2is isomorphic to\r
f4/so(9). But we already know that this tangent space is just O2, or in other words, the spinor\r
representation of so(9). We thus have\r
f4\r
∼= so(9) ⊕ S9 (16)\r
as vector spaces, where so(9) is a Lie subalgebra. The bracket in f4 is built from the bracket in\r
so(9), the action so(9) ⊗ S9 → S9, and the map S9 ⊗ S9 → so(9) obtained by dualizing this action.\r
We can also rewrite this description of f4 in terms of the octonions, as follows:\r
f4\r
∼= so(O ⊕ R) ⊕ O\r
2\r
This last formula suggests that we decompose f4 further using the splitting of O ⊕ R into O and\r
R. It is easily seen by looking at matrices that for all n, m we have\r
so(n + m) ∼= so(n) ⊕ so(m) ⊕ Vn ⊗ Vm. (17)\r
Moreover, when we restrict the representation S9 to so(8), it splits as a direct sum S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
. Using\r
these facts and equation (16), we see\r
f4\r
∼= so(8) ⊕ V8 ⊕ S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
(18)\r
This formula emphasizes the close relation between f4 and triality: the Lie bracket in f4 is completely\r
built out of maps involving so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible representations! We can\r
rewrite this in a way that brings out the role of the octonions:\r
f4\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ O\r
3\r
While elegant, none of these descriptions of f4 gives a convenient picture of all the derivations\r
of the exceptional Jordan algebra. In fact, there is a nice picture of this sort for h3(K) whenever K\r
is a normed division algebra. One way to get a derivation of the Jordan algebra h3(K) is to take a\r
derivation of K and let it act on each entry of the matrices in h3(K). Another way uses elements of\r
sa3(K) = {x ∈ K[3]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.\r
Given x ∈ sa3(K), there is a derivation adx of h3(K) given by\r
adx(a) = [x, a].\r
40

In fact [5], every derivation of h3(K) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of derivations\r
of these two sorts, so we have\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K) (19)\r
as vector spaces. In the case of the octonions, this decomposition says that\r
f4\r
∼= g2 ⊕ sa3(O).\r
In equation (19), the subspace der(K) is always a Lie subalgebra, but sa3(K) is not unless K is\r
commutative and associative — in which case der(K) vanishes. Nonetheless, there is a formula for\r
the brackets in der(h3(K)) which applies in every case [75]. Given D, D′ ∈ der(K) and x, y ∈ sa3(K),\r
we have\r
[D, D′] = DD′ − D′D\r
[D, adx] = adDx\r
[adx, ady] = ad[x,y]0 +\r
1\r
3\r
X\r
3\r
i,j=1\r
Dxij ,yij\r
(20)\r
where D acts on x componentwise, [x, y]0 is the trace-free part of the commutator [x, y], and Dxij,yij\r
is the derivation of K defined using equation (14).\r
Summarizing these different descriptions of f4, we have:\r
Theorem 5. The compact real form of f4 is given by\r
f4\r
∼= isom(OP2\r
)\r
∼= der(h3(O))\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ sa3(O)\r
∼= so(O ⊕ R) ⊕ O\r
2\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ O\r
3\r
where in each case the Lie bracket is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.\r
4.3 The Magic Square\r
Around 1956, Boris Rosenfeld [79] had the remarkable idea that just as F4 is the isometry group of\r
the projective plane over the octonions, the exceptional Lie groups E6, E7 and E8 are the isometry\r
groups of projective planes over the following three algebras, respectively:\r
• the bioctonions, C ⊗ O,\r
• the quateroctonions, H ⊗ O,\r
• the octooctonions, O ⊗ O.\r
There is definitely something right about this idea, because one would expect these projective planes\r
to have dimensions 32, 64, and 128, and there indeed do exist compact Riemannian manifolds with\r
these dimensions having E6, E7 and E8 as their isometry groups. The problem is that the bioctonions,\r
quateroctonions and and octooctonions are not division algebras, so it is a nontrivial matter to define\r
projective planes over them!\r
The situation is not so bad for the bioctonions: h3(C⊗O) is a simple Jordan algebra, though not\r
a formally real one, and one can use this to define (C ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
in a manner modeled after one of the\r
constructions of OP2. Rosenfeld claimed that a similar construction worked for the quateroctonions\r
and octooctonions, but this appears to be false. Among other problems, h3(H ⊗ O) and h3(O ⊗ O)\r
do not become Jordan algebras under the product a ◦ b = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba). Scattered throughout the\r
41

literature [6, 42, 43] one can find frustrated comments about the lack of a really nice construction\r
of (H ⊗ O)P\r
2 and (O ⊗ O)P2\r
. One problem is that these spaces do not satisfy the usual axioms\r
for a projective plane. Tits addressed this problem in his theory of ‘buildings’, which allows one\r
to construct a geometry having any desired algebraic group as symmetries [97]. But alas, it still\r
seems that the quickest way to get our hands on the quateroctonionic and octooctonionic ‘projective\r
planes’ is by starting with the Lie groups E7 and E8 and then taking quotients by suitable subgroups.\r
In short, more work must be done before we can claim to fully understand the geometrical\r
meaning of the Lie groups E6,E7 and E8. Luckily, Rosenfeld’s ideas can be used to motivate a\r
nice construction of their Lie algebras. This goes by the name of the ‘magic square’. Tits [96] and\r
Freudenthal [41] found two very different versions of this construction in about 1958, but we shall\r
start by presenting a simplified version published by E. B. Vinberg [99] in 1966.\r
First consider the projective plane KP2 when K is a normed division algebra K. The points of this\r
plane are the rank-1 projections in the Jordan algebra h3(K), and this plane admits a Riemannian\r
metric such that\r
isom(KP2) ∼= der(h3(K)).\r
Moreover, we have seen in equation (19) that\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K).\r
Combined with Rosenfeld’s observations, these facts might lead one to hope that whenever we have\r
a pair of normed division algebras K and K′, there is a Riemannian manifold (K ⊗ K′)P\r
2 with\r
isom((K ⊗ K\r
′\r
)P\r
2\r
) ∼= der(K) ⊕ der(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
)\r
where for any ∗-algebra A we define\r
shn(A) = {x ∈ A[n]: x\r
∗ = x, tr(x) = 0}\r
san(A) = {x ∈ A[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.\r
This motivated Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras:\r
M(K, K\r
′\r
) = der(K) ⊕ der(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
).\r
Now, when K⊗K′is commutative and associative, sa3(K⊗K′) is a Lie algebra with the commutator\r
as its Lie bracket, but in the really interesting cases it is not. Thus to make M(K, K′) into a Lie\r
algebra we must give it a rather subtle bracket. We have already seen the special case K′ = R in\r
equation (20). In general, the Lie bracket in M(K, K′) is given as follows:\r
1. der(K) and der(K′) are commuting Lie subalgebras of M(K, K′).\r
2. The bracket of D ∈ der(K) ⊕ der(K′) with x ∈ sa3(K ⊗ K′) is given by applying D to every\r
entry of the matrix x, using the natural action of der(K) ⊕ der(K′) as derivations of K ⊗ K′.\r
3. Given X, Y ∈ sa3(K ⊗ K′),\r
[X, Y ] = [X, Y ]0 +\r
1\r
3\r
X\r
3\r
i,j=1\r
DXij ,Yij .\r
Here [X, Y ]0 is the traceless part of the 3 × 3 matrix [X, Y ], and given x, y ∈ K ⊗ K′ we define\r
Dx,y ∈ der(K) ⊕ der(K′) in the following way: Dx,y is real-bilinear in x and y, and\r
Da⊗a′\r
,b⊗b\r
′ = ha\r
′\r
, b′iDa,b + ha, biDa′\r
,b′\r
where a, b ∈ K, a\r
′\r
, b′ ∈ K′, and Da,b, Da′\r
,b′ are defined as in equation (14).\r
42

With this construction we magically obtain the following square of Lie algebras:\r
K\r
′ = R K′ = C K′ = H K′ = O\r
K = R so(3) su(3) sp(3) f4\r
K = C su(3) su(3) ⊕ su(3) su(6) e6\r
K = H sp(3) su(6) so(12) e7\r
K = O f4 e6 e7 e8\r
Table 5 — Magic Square Lie Algebras M(K, K′)\r
We will mainly be interested in the last row (or column), which is the one involving the octonions.\r
In this case we can take the magic square construction as defining the Lie algebras f4, e6, e7 and e8.\r
This definition turns out to be consistent with our earlier definition of f4.\r
Starting from Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras, we can easily recover Tits’\r
original definition. To do so, we need two facts. First,\r
sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
) ∼= sa3(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ (Im(K)⊗sh3(K\r
′\r
)).\r
This is easily seen by direct examination of the relevant matrices. Second,\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K)\r
as vector spaces. This is just equation (19). Starting with Vinberg’s definition and applying these\r
two facts, we obtain\r
M(K, K′) = der(K) ⊕ der(K′) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K′)\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ der(K′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K′) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′))\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ der(h3(K′\r
)) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′)).\r
The last line is Tits’ definition of the magic square Lie algebras. Unlike Vinberg’s, it is not manifestly\r
symmetrical in K and K′. This unhappy feature is somewhat made up for by the fact that der(K) ⊕\r
der(h3(K′)) is a nice big Lie subalgebra. This subalgebra acts on Im(K)⊗sh3(K′) in an obvious way,\r
using the fact that any derivation of K maps Im(K) to itself, and any derivation of h3(K′) maps\r
sh3(K′) to itself. However, the bracket of two elements of (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′)) is a bit of a mess.\r
Yet another description of the magic square was recently given by Barton and Sudbery [5]. This\r
one emphasizes the role of trialities. Let tri(K) be the Lie algebra of the group Aut(t), where t is\r
the normed triality giving the normed division algebra K. From equation (5) we have\r
tri(R) ∼= {0}\r
tri(C) ∼= u(1)2\r
tri(H) ∼= sp(1)3\r
tri(O) ∼= so(8).\r
(21)\r
To express the magic square in terms of these Lie algebras, we need three facts. First, it is easy to\r
see that\r
sh3(K) ∼= K\r
3 ⊕ R2\r
.\r
Second, Barton and Sudbery show that as vector spaces,\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= tri(K) ⊕ K\r
3\r
.\r
43

This follows in a case–by–case way from equation (21), but they give a unified proof that covers all\r
cases. Third, they show that as vector spaces,\r
tri(K) ∼= der(K) ⊕ Im(K)\r
2\r
.\r
Now starting with Tits’ definition of the magic square, applying the first two facts, regrouping terms,\r
and applying the third fact, we obtain Barton and Sudbery’s version of the magic square:\r
M(K, K′) ∼= der(K) ⊕ der(h3(K′\r
)) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′))\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ K′3 ⊕ Im(K)⊗(K′3 ⊕ R\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ Im(K)\r
2 ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′)\r
3\r
∼= tri(K) ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′)\r
3\r
.\r
In the next three sections we use all these different versions of the magic square to give lots of\r
octonionic descriptions of e6, e7 and e8. To save space, we usually omit the formulas for the Lie\r
bracket in these descriptions. However, the patient reader can reconstruct these with the help of\r
Barton and Sudbery’s paper, which is packed with useful formulas.\r
As we continue our tour through the exceptional Lie algebras, we shall make contact with Adams’\r
work [2] constructing f4, e6, e7, and e8 with the help of spinors and rotation group Lie algebras:\r
f4\r
∼= so(9) ⊕ S9\r
e6\r
∼= so(10) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ S10\r
e7\r
∼= so(12) ⊕ sp(1) ⊕ S\r
+\r
12\r
e8\r
∼= so(16) ⊕ S\r
+\r
16\r
as vector spaces. Note that the numbers 9, 10, 12 and 16 are 8 more than the dimensions of R, C, H\r
and O. As usual, this is no coincidence! In terms of the octonions, Bott periodicity implies that\r
Sn+8 ∼= Sn ⊗ O\r
2\r
.\r
This gives the following description of spinors in dimensions ≤ 16:\r
S1 = R S9 = O\r
2\r
S2 = C S10 = (C ⊗ O)\r
2\r
S3 = H S11 = (H ⊗ O)\r
2\r
S\r
±\r
4 = H S\r
±\r
12 = (H ⊗ O)\r
2\r
S5 = H\r
2 S13 = (H2 ⊗ O)2\r
S6 = C\r
4 S14 = (C4 ⊗ O)2\r
S7 = O S15 = (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
S\r
±\r
8 = O S\r
±\r
16 = (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
Table 6 — Spinor Representations Revisited\r
Since spinors in dimensions 1,2,4 and 8 are isomorphic to the division algebras R, C, H and O, spinors\r
in dimensions 8 higher are isomorphic to the ‘planes’ O2,(C ⊗ O)\r
2\r
,(H ⊗ O)\r
2 and (O ⊗ O)2 — and\r
are thus closely linked to f4, e6, e7 and e8, thanks to the magic square.\r
4.4 E6\r
We begin with the 78-dimensional exceptional Lie group E6. As we mentioned in Section 3.4, there\r
is a nice description of a certain noncompact real form of E6 as the group of collineations of OP2, or\r
44

equivalently, the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of h3(O). But before going\r
into these, we consider the magic square constructions of the Lie algebra e6. Vinberg’s construction\r
gives\r
e6 = der(O) ⊕ sa3(C ⊗ O).\r
Tits’ construction, which is asymmetrical, gives\r
e6\r
∼= der(h3(O)) ⊕ sh3\r
(O)\r
and also\r
e6\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(C)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(C)).\r
The Barton-Sudbery construction gives\r
e6\r
∼= tri(O) ⊕ tri(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)\r
3\r
.\r
We can use any of these to determine the dimension of e6. For example, we have\r
dim(e6) = dim(der(h3(O))) + dim(sh3(O)) = 52 + 26 = 78.\r
Starting from the Barton-Sudbery construction and using the concrete descriptions of tri(O) and\r
tri(C) from equation (21), we obtain\r
e6\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)\r
3\r
Using equation (17), we may rewrite this as\r
e6\r
∼= so(O ⊕ C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)\r
2\r
and it turns out that the summand so(O⊕C)⊕Im(C) is actually a Lie subalgebra of e6. This result\r
can also be found in Adams’ book [2], phrased as follows:\r
e6\r
∼= so(10) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ S10\r
In fact, he describes the bracket in e6 in terms of natural operations involving so(10) and its spinor\r
representation S10. The funny-looking factor of u(1) comes from the fact that this spinor represen\u0002tation is complex. The bracket of an element of u(1) and an element of S10 is another element of\r
S10, defined using the obvious action of u(1) on this complex vector space.\r
If we define E6 to be the simply connected group with Lie algebra e6, it follows from results of\r
Adams that the subgroup generated by the Lie subalgebra so(10)⊕u(1) is isomorphic to (Spin(10)×\r
U(1))/Z4. This lets us define the bioctonionic projective plane by\r
(C ⊗ O)P\r
2 = E6 / ((Spin(10) × U(1))/Z4)\r
and conclude that the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S10 ∼= (C ⊗ O)\r
2\r
.\r
Since E6 is compact, we can put an E6-invariant Riemannian metric on the bioctonionic projective\r
plane by averaging any metric with respect to the action of this group. It turns out [6] that the\r
isometry group of this metric is exactly E6, so we have\r
E6\r
∼= Isom((C ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
).\r
It follows that\r
e6\r
∼= isom((C ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
).\r
Summarizing, we have 6 octonionic descriptions of e6:\r
45

Theorem 6. The compact real form of e6 is given by\r
e6\r
∼= isom((C ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(C)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(C))\r
∼= der(h3(O)) ⊕ sh3\r
(O)\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ sa3(C ⊗ O)\r
∼= so(O ⊕ C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)\r
2\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(C) ⊕ Im(C) ⊕ (C ⊗ O)\r
3\r
where in each case the Lie bracket of e6 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.\r
The smallest nontrivial representations of E6 are 27-dimensional: in fact it has two inequivalent\r
representations of this dimension, which are dual to one another. Now, the exceptional Jordan\r
algebra is also 27-dimensional, and in 1950 this clue led Chevalley and Schafer [21] to give a nice\r
description of E6 as symmetries of this algebra. These symmetries do not preserve the product, but\r
only the determinant.\r
More precisely, the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of h3(O) turns out to\r
be a noncompact real form of E6. This real form is sometimes called E6(−26), because its Killing form\r
has signature −26. To see this, note that any automorphism of h3(O) preserves the determinant, so\r
we get an inclusion\r
F4 ֒→ E6(−26).\r
This means that F4 is a compact subgroup of E6(−26). In fact it is a maximal compact subgroup, since\r
if there were a larger one, we could average a Riemannian metric group on OP2 with respect to this\r
group and get a metric with an isometry group larger than F4, but no such metric exists. It follows\r
that the Killing form on the Lie algebra e6(−26) is negative definite on its 52-dimensional maximal\r
compact Lie algebra, f4, and positive definite on the complementary 26-dimensional subspace, giving\r
a signature of 26 − 52 = −26.\r
We saw in Section 3.4 that the projective plane structure of OP2can be constructed starting\r
only with the determinant function on the vector space h3(O). It follows that E6(−26) acts as\r
collineations on OP2, that is, line-preserving transformations. In fact, the group of collineations\r
of OP2is precisely E6(−26):\r
E6(−26) ∼= Coll(OP2).\r
Moreover, just as the group of isometries of OP2fixing a specific point is a copy of Spin(9), the\r
group of collineations fixing a specific point is Spin(9, 1). This fact follows with some work starting\r
from equation (8), and it gives us a commutative square of inclusions:\r
Spin(9) −→ Isom(OP2) ∼= F4\r
↓ ↓\r
Spin(9, 1) −→ Coll(OP2) ∼= E6(−26)\r
where the groups on the top are maximal compact subgroups of those on the bottom. Thus in a\r
very real sense, F4 is to 9-dimensional Euclidean geometry as E6(−26) is to 10-dimensional Lorentzian\r
geometry.\r
4.5 E7\r
Next we turn to the 133-dimensional exceptional Lie group E7. In 1954, Freudenthal [41] de\u0002scribed this group as the automorphism group of a 56-dimensional octonionic structure now called\r
46

a ‘Freudenthal triple system’. We sketch this idea below, but first we give some magic square\r
constructions. Vinberg’s version of the magic square gives\r
e7 = der(H) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3(H ⊗ O).\r
Tits’ version gives\r
e7\r
∼= der(H) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(H)⊗sh3\r
(O)) (22)\r
and also\r
e7\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(H)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(H))\r
The Barton-Sudbery version gives\r
e7\r
∼= tri(O) ⊕ tri(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)\r
3\r
(23)\r
Starting from equation (22) and using the fact that der(H) ∼= Im(H) is 3-dimensional, we obtain\r
the elegant formula\r
e7\r
∼= der(h3(O)) ⊕ h3(O)\r
3\r
.\r
This gives an illuminating way to compute the dimension of e7:\r
dim(e7) = dim(der(h3(O))) + 3 dim(h3(O)) = 52 + 3 · 27 = 133.\r
Starting from equation (23) and using the concrete descriptions of tri(H) and tri(O) from equation\r
(21), we obtain\r
e7\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)\r
3\r
Using equation (17), we may rewrite this as\r
e7\r
∼= so(O ⊕ H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)\r
2\r
.\r
Though not obvious from what we have done, the direct summand so(O ⊕ H) ⊕ Im(H) here is really\r
a Lie subalgebra of e7. In less octonionic language, this result can also be found in Adams’ book [2]:\r
e7\r
∼= so(12) ⊕ sp(1) ⊕ S\r
+\r
12\r
He describes the bracket in e7 in terms of natural operations involving so(12) and its spinor rep\u0002resentation S\r
+\r
12. The funny-looking factor of sp(1) comes from the fact that this representation is\r
quaternionic. The bracket of an element of sp(1) and an element of S\r
+\r
12 is the element of S\r
+\r
12 defined\r
using the natural action of sp(1) on this space.\r
If we let E7 be the simply connected group with Lie algebra e7, it follows from results of Adams\r
[2] that the subgroup generated by the Lie subalgebra so(12) ⊕ sp(1) is isomorphic to (Spin(12) ×\r
Sp(1))/Z2. This lets us define the quateroctonionic projective plane by\r
(H ⊗ O)P\r
2 = E7 / ((Spin(12) × Sp(1))/Z2)\r
and conclude that the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S\r
+\r
12\r
∼= (H ⊗ O)\r
2\r
.\r
We can put an E7-invariant Riemannian metric on this manifold by the technique of averaging over\r
the group action. It then turns out [6] that\r
E7\r
∼= Isom((H ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
and thus\r
e7\r
∼= isom((H ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
).\r
Summarizing, we have the following 7 octonionic descriptions of e7:\r
47

Theorem 7. The compact real form of e7 is given by\r
e7\r
∼= isom((H ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(h3(O)) ⊕ h3(O)\r
3\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(H)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(H))\r
∼= der(H) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(H)⊗sh3\r
(O))\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(H) ⊕ sa3(H ⊗ O)\r
∼= so(O ⊕ H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)\r
2\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(H) ⊕ Im(H) ⊕ (H ⊗ O)\r
3\r
where in each case the Lie bracket of e7 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.\r
Before the magic square was developed, Freudenthal [41] used another octonionic construction\r
to study E7. The smallest nontrivial representation of this group is 56-dimensional. Freudenthal\r
realized we can define a 56-dimensional space\r
F = {\r
\u0012\r
α x\r
y β \u0013\r
: x, y ∈ h3(O), α, β ∈ R}\r
and equip this space with a symplectic structure\r
ω: F × F → R\r
and trilinear product\r
τ: F × F × F → F\r
such that the group of linear transformations preserving both these structures is a certain noncom\u0002pact real form of E7, namely E7(−25). The symplectic structure and trilinear product on F satisfy\r
some relations, and algebraists have made these into the definition of a ‘Freudenthal triple system’\r
[13, 36, 72]. The geometrical significance of this rather complicated sort of structure has recently\r
been clarified by some physicists working on string theory. At the end of the previous section, we\r
mentioned a relation between 9-dimensional Euclidean geometry and F4, and a corresponding rela\u0002tion between 10-dimensional Lorentzian geometry and E6(−26). Murat G¨unaydin [48] has extended\r
this to a relation between 10-dimensional conformal geometry and E7(−25), and in work with Kil\u0002ian Koepsell and Hermann Nikolai [49] has explicated how this is connected to Freudenthal triple\r
systems.\r
4.6 E8\r
With 248 dimensions, E8 is the biggest of the exceptional Lie groups, and in some ways the most\r
mysterious. The easiest way to understand a group is to realize it as as symmetries of a structure\r
one already understands. Of all the simple Lie groups, E8 is the only one whose smallest nontrivial\r
representation is the adjoint representation. This means that in the context of linear algebra, E8 is\r
most simply described as the group of symmetries of its own Lie algebra! One way out of this vicious\r
circle would be to describe E8 as isometries of a Riemannian manifold. As already mentioned, E8\r
is the isometry group of a 128-dimensional manifold called (O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
. But alas, nobody seems to\r
know how to define (O ⊗ O)P\r
2 without first defining E8. Thus this group remains a bit enigmatic.\r
At present, to get our hands on E8 we must start with its Lie algebra. We can define this\r
using any of the three equivalent magic square constructions explained in Section 4.3. Vinberg’s\r
construction gives\r
e8 = der(O) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3(O ⊗ O).\r
48

Tits’ construction gives\r
e8\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(O)).\r
The Barton-Sudbery construction gives\r
e8\r
∼= tri(O) ⊕ tri(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
(24)\r
We can use any of these to count the dimension of e8; for example, the last one gives\r
dim e8 = 28 + 28 + 3 · 8\r
2 = 248.\r
To emphasize the importance of triality, we can rewrite equation (24) as:\r
e8\r
∼= so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8) ⊕ (S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
) ⊕ (S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
). (25)\r
Here the Lie bracket is built from natural maps relating so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible\r
representations. In particular, so(8) ⊕ so(8) is a Lie subalgebra, and the first copy of so(8) acts on\r
the first factor in V8 ⊗ V8, S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
, and S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
, while the second copy acts on the second factor\r
in each of these. The reader should compare this to the description of f4 in equation (18).\r
Now, equation (17) implies that\r
so(16) ∼= so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8).\r
Together with equation (25), this suggests that e8 contains so(16) as a Lie subalgebra. In fact this\r
is true! Even better, if we restrict the right-handed spinor representation of so(16) to so(8) ⊕ so(8),\r
it decomposes as\r
S\r
+\r
16\r
∼= (S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
) ⊕ (S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
),\r
so we obtain\r
e8\r
∼= so(16) ⊕ S\r
+\r
16 (26)\r
or in more octonionic language,\r
e8\r
∼= so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
where we use so(V ) to mean the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the real\r
inner product space V .\r
The really remarkable thing about equation (26) is that the Lie bracket in e8 is entirely built\r
from natural maps involving so(16) and S\r
+\r
16:\r
so(16) ⊗ so(16) → so(16), so(16) ⊗ S\r
+\r
16 → S\r
+\r
16, S+\r
16 ⊗ S\r
+\r
16 → so(16).\r
The first of these is the Lie bracket in so(16), the second is the action of so(16) on its right-handed\r
spinor representation, and the third is obtained from the second by duality, using the natural inner\r
product on so(16) and S\r
+\r
16 to identify these spaces with their duals. In fact, this is a very efficient\r
way to define e8. If we take this approach, we must verify the Jacobi identity:\r
[[a, b], c] = [a, [b, c]] − [b, [a, c]].\r
When all three of a, b, c lie in so(16) this is just the Jacobi identity for so(16). When two of them\r
lie in so(16), it boils down to fact that spinors indeed form a representation of so(16). Thanks to\r
duality, the same is true when just one lies in so(16). It thus suffices to consider the case when a, b, c\r
all lie in S\r
+\r
16. This is the only case that uses anything special about the number 16. Unfortunately,\r
at this point a brute-force calculation seems to be required. For two approaches that minimize the\r
49

pain, see the books by Adams [2] and by Green, Schwarz and Witten [46]. It would be nice to find\r
a more conceptual approach.\r
Starting from e8, we can define E8 to be the simply-connected Lie group with this Lie algebra. As\r
shown by Adams [2], the subgroup of E8 generated by the Lie subalgebra so(16) ⊂ e8 is Spin(16)/Z2.\r
This lets us define the octooctonionic projective plane by\r
(O ⊗ O)P\r
2 = E8 / (Spin(16)/Z2).\r
By equation (26), the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S\r
+\r
16\r
∼= (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
.\r
This partially justifies calling it ‘octooctonionic projective plane’, though it seems not to satisfy the\r
usual axioms for a projective plane.\r
We can put an E8-invariant Riemannian metric on the octooctonionic projective plane by the\r
technique of averaging over the group action. It then turns out [6] that\r
E8\r
∼= Isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
and thus\r
e8\r
∼= isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
).\r
Summarizing, we have the following octonionic descriptions of E8:\r
Theorem 8. The compact real form of e8 is given by\r
e8\r
∼= isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(O))\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3(O ⊗ O)\r
∼= so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
where in each case the Lie bracket on e8 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.\r
5 Conclusions\r
It should be clear by now that besides being a fascinating mathematical object in their own right,\r
the octonions link together many important phenomena whose connections would otherwise be\r
completely mysterious. Indeed, the full story of these connections is deeper and more elaborate than\r
I have been able to explain here! It also includes:\r
• Attempts to set up an octonionic analogue of the theory of analytic functions (see [51] and the\r
references therein).\r
• The role of Jordan pairs, Jordan triple systems and Freudenthal triple systems in the construc\u0002tion of exceptional Lie groups [13, 36, 37, 49, 51, 71, 72].\r
• Constructions of the E8 lattice and Leech lattice using integral octonions [26, 33].\r
• Tensor-categorical approaches to normed division algebras and the invariant of framed trivalent\r
graphs coming from the quantum group associated to G2 [9, 12, 64, 81].\r
• Octonionic constructions of vertex operator algebras [38].\r
• Octonionic constructions of the exceptional simple Lie superalgebras [92].\r
• Octonionic constructions of symmetric spaces [6].\r
50

• Octonions and the geometry of the ‘squashed 7-spheres’, that is, the homogeneous spaces\r
Spin(7)/G2, Spin(6)/SU(3), and Spin(5)/SU(2), all of which are diffeomorphic to S\r
7 with its\r
usual smooth structure [22].\r
• The theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’, that is, 7-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with holonomy\r
group G2 [60].\r
• The octonionic Hopf map and instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in 8 dimensions\r
[47].\r
• Octonionic aspects of 10-dimensional superstring theory and 10-dimensional super-Yang-Mills\r
theory [25, 29, 35, 65, 85, 86].\r
• Octonionic aspects of 11-dimensional supergravity and supermembrane theories, and the role\r
of Joyce manifolds in compactifying 11-dimensional supergravity to obtain theories of physics\r
in 4 dimensions [32].\r
• Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C ⊗ H ⊗ O [31].\r
• Other attempts to use the octonions in physics [20, 51, 67, 76].\r
I urge the reader to explore these with the help of the references.\r

Abstract\r
The octonions are the largest of the four normed division algebras. While somewhat neglected\r
due to their nonassociativity, they stand at the crossroads of many interesting fields of mathe\u0002matics. Here we describe them and their relation to Clifford algebras and spinors, Bott period\u0002icity, projective and Lorentzian geometry, Jordan algebras, and the exceptional Lie groups. We\r
also touch upon their applications in quantum logic, special relativity and supersymmetry."""

There are exactly four normed division algebras: the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C),\r
quaternions (H), and octonions (O). The real numbers are the dependable breadwinner of the\r
family, the complete ordered field we all rely on. The complex numbers are a slightly flashier but\r
still respectable younger brother: not ordered, but algebraically complete. The quaternions, being\r
noncommutative, are the eccentric cousin who is shunned at important family gatherings. But the\r
octonions are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic: they are nonassociative.\r
Most mathematicians have heard the story of how Hamilton invented the quaternions. In 1835, at\r
the age of 30, he had discovered how to treat complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. Fascinated\r
by the relation between C and 2-dimensional geometry, he tried for many years to invent a bigger\r
algebra that would play a similar role in 3-dimensional geometry. In modern language, it seems he\r
was looking for a 3-dimensional normed division algebra. His quest built to its climax in October\r
1843. He later wrote to his son, “Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month, on my\r
coming down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used to ask me:\r
‘Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets?’ Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of\r
the head: ‘No, I can only add and subtract them’.” The problem, of course, was that there exists\r
no 3-dimensional normed division algebra. He really needed a 4-dimensional algebra.\r
Finally, on the 16th of October, 1843, while walking with his wife along the Royal Canal to a\r
meeting of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin, he made his momentous discovery. “That is to say,\r
I then and there felt the galvanic circuit of thought close; and the sparks which fell from it were the\r
fundamental equations between i, j, k; exactly such as I have used them ever since.” And in a famous\r
act of mathematical vandalism, he carved these equations into the stone of the Brougham Bridge:\r
i\r
2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1.\r
One reason this story is so well-known is that Hamilton spent the rest of his life obsessed with\r
the quaternions and their applications to geometry [45, 53]. And for a while, quaternions were\r
fashionable. They were made a mandatory examination topic in Dublin, and in some American\r
universities they were the only advanced mathematics taught. Much of what we now do with scalars\r
and vectors in R\r
3 was then done using real and imaginary quaternions. A school of ‘quaternionists’\r
developed, which was led after Hamilton’s death by Peter Tait of Edinburgh and Benjamin Peirce of\r
Harvard. Tait wrote 8 books on the quaternions, emphasizing their applications to physics. When\r
Gibbs invented the modern notation for the dot product and cross product, Tait condemned it as a\r
“hermaphrodite monstrosity”. A war of polemics ensued, with such luminaries as Heaviside weighing\r
1

in on the side of vectors. Ultimately the quaternions lost, and acquired a slight taint of disgrace\r
from which they have never fully recovered [27].\r
Less well-known is the discovery of the octonions by Hamilton’s friend from college, John T.\r
Graves. It was Graves’ interest in algebra that got Hamilton thinking about complex numbers\r
and triplets in the first place. The very day after his fateful walk, Hamilton sent an 8-page letter\r
describing the quaternions to Graves. Graves replied on October 26th, complimenting Hamilton on\r
the boldness of the idea, but adding “There is still something in the system which gravels me. I have\r
not yet any clear views as to the extent to which we are at liberty arbitrarily to create imaginaries,\r
and to endow them with supernatural properties.” And he asked: “If with your alchemy you can\r
make three pounds of gold, why should you stop there?”\r
Graves then set to work on some gold of his own! On December 26th, he wrote to Hamilton\r
describing a new 8-dimensional algebra, which he called the ‘octaves’. He showed that they were a\r
normed division algebra, and used this to express the product of two sums of eight perfect squares\r
as another sum of eight perfect squares: the ‘eight squares theorem’ [52].\r
In January 1844, Graves sent three letters to Hamilton expanding on his discovery. He considered\r
the idea of a general theory of ‘2m-ions’, and tried to construct a 16-dimensional normed division\r
algebra, but he “met with an unexpected hitch” and came to doubt that this was possible. Hamilton\r
offered to publicize Graves’ discovery, but being busy with work on quaternions, he kept putting it\r
off. In July he wrote to Graves pointing out that the octonions were nonassociative: “A · BC =\r
AB · C = ABC, if A, B, C be quaternions, but not so, generally, with your octaves.” In fact,\r
Hamilton first invented the term ‘associative’ at about this time, so the octonions may have played\r
a role in clarifying the importance of this concept.\r
Meanwhile the young Arthur Cayley, fresh out of Cambridge, had been thinking about the\r
quaternions ever since Hamilton announced their existence. He seemed to be seeking relationships\r
between the quaternions and hyperelliptic functions. In March of 1845, he published a paper in the\r
Philosophical Magazine entitled ‘On Jacobi’s Elliptic Functions, in Reply to the Rev. B. Bronwin;\r
and on Quaternions’ [18]. The bulk of this paper was an attempt to rebut an article pointing out\r
mistakes in Cayley’s work on elliptic functions. Apparently as an afterthought, he tacked on a brief\r
description of the octonions. In fact, this paper was so full of errors that it was omitted from his\r
collected works — except for the part about octonions [19].\r
Upset at being beaten to publication, Graves attached a postscript to a paper of his own which\r
was to appear in the following issue of the same journal, saying that he had known of the octonions\r
ever since Christmas, 1843. On June 14th, 1847, Hamilton contributed a short note to the Transac\u0002tions of the Royal Irish Academy, vouching for Graves’ priority. But it was too late: the octonions\r
became known as ‘Cayley numbers’. Still worse, Graves later found that his eight squares theorem\r
had already been discovered by C. F. Degen in 1818 [28, 30].\r
Why have the octonions languished in such obscurity compared to the quaternions? Besides\r
their rather inglorious birth, one reason is that they lacked a tireless defender such as Hamilton.\r
But surely the reason for this is that they lacked any clear application to geometry and physics.\r
The unit quaternions form the group SU(2), which is the double cover of the rotation group SO(3).\r
This makes them nicely suited to the study of rotations and angular momentum, particularly in\r
the context of quantum mechanics. These days we regard this phenomenon as a special case of the\r
theory of Clifford algebras. Most of us no longer attribute to the quaternions the cosmic significance\r
that Hamilton claimed for them, but they fit nicely into our understanding of the scheme of things.\r
The octonions, on the other hand, do not. Their relevance to geometry was quite obscure\r
until 1925, when Elie Cartan described ‘triality’ — the symmetry between vec ´ tors and spinors in 8-\r
dimensional Euclidean space [17]. Their potential relevance to physics was noticed in a 1934 paper by\r
Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner on the foundations of quantum mechanics [59]. However, attempts\r
by Jordan and others to apply octonionic quantum mechanics to nuclear and particle physics met\r
with little success. Work along these lines continued quite slowly until the 1980s, when it was\r
realized that the octonions explain some curious features of string theory [65]. The Lagrangian for\r
2

the classical superstring involves a relationship between vectors and spinors in Minkowski spacetime\r
which holds only in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions. Note that these numbers are 2 more than the\r
dimensions of R, C, H and O. As we shall see, this is no coincidence: briefly, the isomorphisms\r
sl(2, R) ∼= so(2, 1)\r
sl(2, C) ∼= so(3, 1)\r
sl(2, H) ∼= so(5, 1)\r
sl(2, O) ∼= so(9, 1)\r
allow us to treat a spinor in one of these dimensions as a pair of elements of the corresponding division\r
algebra. It is fascinating that of these superstring Lagrangians, it is the 10-dimensional octonionic\r
one that gives the most promising candidate for a realistic theory of fundamental physics! However,\r
there is still no proof that the octonions are useful for understanding the real world. We can only\r
hope that eventually this question will be settled one way or another.\r
Besides their possible role in physics, the octonions are important because they tie together\r
some algebraic structures that otherwise appear as isolated and inexplicable exceptions. As we\r
shall explain, the concept of an octonionic projective space OPnonly makes sense for n ≤ 2, due\r
to the nonassociativity of O. This means that various structures associated to real, complex and\r
quaternionic projective spaces have octonionic analogues only for n ≤ 2.\r
Simple Lie algebras are a nice example of this phenomenon. There are 3 infinite families of\r
‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, which come from the isometry groups of the projective spaces RPn,\r
CPnand HPn. There are also 5 ‘exceptional’ simple Lie algebras. These were discovered by Killing\r
and Cartan in the late 1800s. At the time, the significance of these exceptions was shrouded in\r
mystery: they did not arise as symmetry groups of known structures. Only later did their connection\r
to the octonions become clear. It turns out that 4 of them come from the isometry groups of the\r
projective planes over O, O ⊗ C, O ⊗ H and O ⊗ O. The remaining one is the automorphism group\r
of the octonions!\r
Another good example is the classification of simple formally real Jordan algebras. Besides\r
several infinite families of these, there is the ‘exceptional’ Jordan algebra, which consists of 3 × 3\r
hermitian octonionic matrices. Minimal projections in this Jordan algebra correspond to points of\r
OP2, and the automorphism group of this algebra is the same as the isometry group of OP2.\r
The octonions also have fascinating connections to topology. In 1957, Raoul Bott computed\r
the homotopy groups of the topological group O(∞), which is the inductive limit of the orthogonal\r
groups O(n) as n → ∞. He proved that they repeat with period 8:\r
πi+8(O(∞)) ∼= πi(O(∞)).\r
This is known as ‘Bott periodicity’. He also computed the first 8:\r
π0(O(∞)) ∼= Z2\r
π1(O(∞)) ∼= Z2\r
π2(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π3(O(∞)) ∼= Z\r
π4(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π5(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π6(O(∞)) ∼= 0\r
π7(O(∞)) ∼= Z\r
Note that the nonvanishing homotopy groups here occur in dimensions one less than the dimensions\r
of R, C, H, and O. This is no coincidence! In a normed division algebra, left multiplication by an\r
element of norm one defines an orthogonal transformation of the algebra, and thus an element of"""

0\r
, S1, S3 and S\r
7\r
to O(∞), and these maps generate\r
the homotopy groups in those dimensions.\r
Given this, one might naturally guess that the period-8 repetition in the homotopy groups of\r
O(∞) is in some sense ‘caused’ by the octonions. As we shall see, this is true. Conversely, Bott\r
periodicity is closely connected to the problem of how many pointwise linearly independent smooth\r
vector fields can be found on the n-sphere [56]. There exist n such vector fields only when n + 1 =\r
1, 2, 4, or 8, and this can be used to show that division algebras over the reals can only occur in\r
these dimensions.\r
In what follows we shall try to explain the octonions and their role in algebra, geometry, and\r
topology. In Section 2 we give four constructions of the octonions: first via their multiplication\r
table, then using the Fano plane, then using the Cayley–Dickson construction and finally using\r
Clifford algebras, spinors, and a generalized concept of ‘triality’ advocated by Frank Adams [2].\r
Each approach has its own merits. In Section 3 we discuss the projective lines and planes over\r
the normed division algebras — especially O — and describe their relation to Bott periodicity, the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra, and the Lie algebra isomorphisms listed above. Finally, in Section 4 we\r
discuss octonionic constructions of the exceptional Lie groups, especially the ‘magic square’."""

Before our tour begins, let us settle on some definitions. For us a vector space will always be a\r
finite-dimensional module over the field of real numbers. An algebra A will be a vector space that\r
is equipped with a bilinear map m: A × A → A called ‘multiplication’ and a nonzero element 1 ∈ A\r
called the ‘unit’ such that m(1, a) = m(a, 1) = a. As usual, we abbreviate m(a, b) as ab. We do\r
not assume our algebras are associative! Given an algebra, we will freely think of real numbers as\r
elements of this algebra via the map α 7→ α1.\r
An algebra A is a division algebra if given a, b ∈ A with ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.\r
Equivalently, A is a division algebra if the operations of left and right multiplication by any nonzero\r
element are invertible. A normed division algebra is an algebra A that is also a normed vector\r
space with kabk = kakkbk. This implies that A is a division algebra and that k1k = 1.\r
We should warn the reader of some subtleties. We say an algebra A has multiplicative inverses\r
if for any nonzero a ∈ A there is an element a\r
−1 ∈ A with aa−1 = a−1a = 1. An associative algebra\r
has multiplicative inverses iff it is a division algebra. However, this fails for nonassociative algebras!\r
In Section 2.2 we shall construct algebras that have multiplicative inverses, but are not division\r
algebras. On the other hand, we can construct a division algebra without multiplicative inverses\r
by taking the quaternions and modifying the product slightly, setting i\r
2 = −1 + ǫj for some small\r
nonzero real number ǫ while leaving the rest of the multiplication table unchanged. The element\r
i then has both right and left inverses, but they are not equal. (We thank David Rusin for this\r
example.)\r
There are three levels of associativity. An algebra is power-associative if the subalgebra gen\u0002erated by any one element is associative. It is alternative if the subalgebra generated by any two\r
elements is associative. Finally, if the subalgebra generated by any three elements is associative, the\r
algebra is associative.\r
As we shall see, the octonions are not associative, but they are alternative. How does one check\r
a thing like this? By a theorem of Emil Artin [84], an algebra A is alternative iff for all a, b ∈ A we\r
have\r
(aa)b = a(ab), (ab)a = a(ba), (ba)a = b(aa) (1)\r
In fact, any two of these equations implies the remaining one, so people usually take the first and\r
last as the definition of ‘alternative’. To see this fact, note that any algebra has a trilinear map\r
[·, ·, ·]: A\r
3 → A\r
4

called the associator, given by\r
[a, b, c] = (ab)c − a(bc).\r
The associator measures the failure of associativity just as the commutator [a, b] = ab−ba measures\r
the failure of commutativity. Now, the commutator is an alternating bilinear map, meaning that it\r
switches sign whenever the two arguments are exchanged:\r
[a, b] = −[b, a]\r
or equivalently, that it vanishes when they are equal:\r
[a, a] = 0.\r
This raises the question of whether the associator is alternating too. In fact, this holds precisely\r
when A is alternative! The reason is that each equation in (1) says that the associator vanishes\r
when a certain pair of arguments are equal, or equivalently, that it changes sign when that pair of\r
arguments is switched. Note, however, that if the associator changes sign when we switch the ith\r
and jth arguments, and also when we switch the jth and kth arguments, it must change sign when\r
we switch the ith and kth. Thus any two of equations (1) imply the third.\r
Now we can say what is so great about R, C, H, and O:\r
Theorem 1. R, C, H, and O are the only normed division algebras.\r
Theorem 2. R, C, H, and O are the only alternative division algebras.\r
The first theorem goes back to an 1898 paper by Hurwitz [55]. It was subsequently generalized\r
in many directions, for example, to algebras over other fields. A version of the second theorem\r
appears in an 1930 paper by Zorn [100] — the guy with the lemma. For modern proofs of both these\r
theorems, see Schafer’s excellent book on nonassociative algebras [84]. We sketch a couple proofs of\r
Hurwitz’s theorem in Section 2.3.\r
Note that we did not state that R, C, H and O are the only division algebras. This is not true.\r
For example, we have already described a way to get 4-dimensional division algebras that do not\r
have multiplicative inverses. However, we do have this fact:\r
Theorem 3. All division algebras have dimension 1, 2, 4, or 8.\r
This was independently proved by Kervaire [62] and Bott–Milnor [11] in 1958. We will say a bit\r
about the proof in Section 3.1. However, in what follows our main focus will not be on general\r
results about division algebras. Instead, we concentrate on special features of the octonions. Let us\r
begin by constructing them."""

The most elementary way to construct the octonions is to give their multiplication table. The\r
octonions are an 8-dimensional algebra with basis 1, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7, and their multiplication\r
is given in this table, which describes the result of multiplying the element in the ith row by the\r

Table 1 — Octonion Multiplication Table\r
Unfortunately, this table is almost completely unenlightening! About the only interesting things one\r
can easily learn from it are:\r
• e1, . . . , e7 are square roots of -1,\r
• ei and ej anticommute when i 6= j:\r
eiej = −ejei\r
• the index cycling identity holds:\r
eiej = ek =⇒ ei+1ej+1 = ek+1\r
where we think of the indices as living in Z7, and\r
• the index doubling identity holds:\r
eiej = ek =⇒ e2ie2j = e2k.\r
Together with a single nontrivial product like e1e2 = e4, these facts are enough to recover the whole\r
multiplication table. However, we really want a better way to remember the octonion product.\r
We should become as comfortable with multiplying octonions as we are with multiplying matrices!\r
And ultimately, we want a more conceptual approach to the octonions, which explains their special\r
properties and how they fit in with other mathematical ideas. In what follows, we give some more\r
descriptions of octonion multiplication, starting with a nice mnemonic, and working up to some\r
deeper, more conceptual ones."""

The quaternions, H, are a 4-dimensional algebra with basis 1, i, j, k. To describe the product we\r

Note that planes through the origin of this 3-dimensional vector space give subalgebras of O iso\u0002morphic to the quaternions, lines through the origin give subalgebras isomorphic to the complex\r
numbers, and the origin itself gives a subalgebra isomorphic to the real numbers.\r
What we really have here is a description of the octonions as a ‘twisted group algebra’. Given\r
any group G, the group algebra R[G] consists of all finite formal linear combinations of elements of\r
G with real coefficients. This is an associative algebra with the product coming from that of G. We\r
can use any function\r
α: G\r
2 → {±1}\r
to ‘twist’ this product, defining a new product\r
⋆: R[G] × R[G] → R[G]\r
by:\r
g ⋆ h = α(g, h) gh,\r
where g, h ∈ G ⊂ R[G]. One can figure out an equation involving α that guarantees this new product\r
will be associative. In this case we call α a ‘2-cocycle’. If α satisfies a certain extra equation, the\r
product ⋆ will also be commutative, and we call α a ‘stable 2-cocycle’. For example, the group\r
algebra R[Z2] is isomorphic to a product of 2 copies of R, but we can twist it by a stable 2-cocyle to\r
obtain the complex numbers. The group algebra R[Z\r
2\r
2\r
] is isomorphic to a product of 4 copies of R,\r
but we can twist it by a 2-cocycle to obtain the quaternions. Similarly, the group algebra R[Z\r
3\r
2\r
] is a\r
product of 8 copies of R, and what we have really done in this section is describe a function α that\r
allows us to twist this group algebra to obtain the octonions. Since the octonions are nonassociative,\r
this function is not a 2-cocycle. However, its coboundary is a ‘stable 3-cocycle’, which allows one\r
to define a new associator and braiding for the category of Z\r
3\r
2\r
-graded vector spaces, making it\r
into a symmetric monoidal category [4]. In this symmetric monoidal category, the octonions are a\r
commutative monoid object. In less technical terms: this category provides a context in which the\r
octonions are commutative and associative! So far this idea has just begun to be exploited."""

It would be nice to have a construction of the normed division algebras R, C, H, O that explained\r
why each one fits neatly inside the next. It would be nice if this construction made it clear why H\r
is noncommutative and O is nonassociative. It would be even better if this construction gave an\r
infinite sequence of algebras, doubling in dimension each time, with the normed division algebras as\r
the first four. In fact, there is such a construction: it’s called the Cayley–Dickson construction.\r
As Hamilton noted, the complex number a+bi can be thought of as a pair (a, b) of real numbers.\r
Addition is done component-wise, and multiplication goes like this:\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db, ad + cb)\r
We can also define the conjugate of a complex number by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a, −b).\r
Now that we have the complex numbers, we can define the quaternions in a similar way. A\r
quaternion can be thought of as a pair of complex numbers. Addition is done component-wise, and\r
multiplication goes like this:\r
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − db∗, a∗d + cb) (2)\r
This is just like our formula for multiplication of complex numbers, but with a couple of conjugates\r
thrown in. If we included them in the previous formula nothing would change, since the conjugate\r
of a real number is just itself. We can also define the conjugate of a quaternion by\r
(a, b)\r
∗ = (a∗\r
, −b). (3)\r

The game continues! Now we can define an octonion to be a pair of quaternions. As before, we\r
add and multiply them using formulas (2) and (3). This trick for getting new algebras from old is\r
called the Cayley–Dickson construction.\r
Why do the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions have multiplicative\r
inverses? I take it as obvious for the real numbers. For the complex numbers, one can check that\r
(a, b)(a, b)\r
∗ = (a, b)∗\r
(a, b) = k(1, 0)\r
where k is a real number, the square of the norm of (a, b). This means that whenever (a, b) is nonzero,\r
its multiplicative inverse is (a, b)\r
∗/k. One can check that the same holds for the quaternions and\r
octonions.\r
But this, of course, raises the question: why isn’t there an infinite sequence of division algebras,\r
each one obtained from the preceding one by the Cayley–Dickson construction? The answer is that\r
each time we apply the construction, our algebra gets a bit worse. First we lose the fact that every\r
element is its own conjugate, then we lose commutativity, then we lose associativity, and finally we\r
lose the division algebra property.\r
To see this clearly, it helps to be a bit more formal. Define a ∗-algebra to be an algebra A\r
equipped with a conjugation, that is, a real-linear map ∗: A → A with\r
a\r
∗∗ = a, (ab)∗ = b∗\r
a\r
∗\r
for all a, b ∈ A. We say a ∗-algebra is real if a = a\r
∗\r
for every element a of the algebra. We say the\r
∗-algebra A is nicely normed if a + a\r
∗ ∈ R and aa∗ = a∗a > 0 for all nonzero a ∈ A. If A is nicely\r
normed we set\r
Re(a) = (a + a\r
∗\r
)/2 ∈ R, Im(a) = (a − a\r
∗\r
)/2,\r
and define a norm on A by\r
kak\r
2 = aa∗\r
.\r
If A is nicely normed, it has multiplicative inverses given by\r
a\r
−1 = a∗\r
/kak\r
2\r
.\r
If A is nicely normed and alternative, A is a normed division algebra. To see this, note that for any\r
a, b ∈ A, all 4 elements a, b, a∗, b∗lie in the associative algebra generated by Im(a) and Im(b), so\r
that\r
kabk\r
2 = (ab)(ab)∗ = ab(b∗\r
a\r
∗\r
) = a(bb∗)a\r
∗ = kak2\r
kbk\r
2\r
.\r
Starting from any ∗-algebra A, the Cayley–Dickson construction gives a new ∗-algebra A′. El\u0002ements of A′ are pairs (a, b) ∈ A2\r
, and multiplication and conjugation are defined using equations\r
(2) and (3). The following propositions show the effect of repeatedly applying the Cayley–Dickson\r
construction:\r
Proposition 1. A′is never real.\r
Proposition 2. A is real (and thus commutative) ⇐⇒ A′is commutative.\r
Proposition 3. A is commutative and associative ⇐⇒ A′is associative.\r

All of these follow from straightforward calculations; to prove them here would merely deprive the\r
reader of the pleasure of doing so. It follows from these propositions that:\r
R is a real commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
C is a commutative associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
H is an associative nicely normed ∗-algebra =⇒\r
O is an alternative nicely normed ∗-algebra\r
and therefore that R, C, H, and O are normed division algebras. It also follows that the octonions\r
are neither real, nor commutative, nor associative.\r
If we keep applying the Cayley–Dickson process to the octonions we get a sequence of ∗-algebras\r
of dimension 16, 32, 64, and so on. The first of these is called the sedenions, presumably alluding\r
to the fact that it is 16-dimensional [67]. It follows from the above results that all the ∗-algebras in\r
this sequence are nicely normed but neither real, nor commutative, nor alternative. They all have\r
multiplicative inverses, since they are nicely normed. But they are not division algebras, since an\r
explicit calculation demonstrates that the sedenions, and thus all the rest, have zero divisors. In\r
fact [24, 73], the zero divisors of norm one in the sedenions form a subspace that is homeomorphic\r
to the exceptional Lie group G2.\r
The Cayley–Dickson construction provides a nice way to obtain the sequence R, H, C, O and the\r
basic properties of these algebras. But what is the meaning of this construction? To answer this,\r
it is better to define A′ as the algebra formed by adjoining to A an element i satisfying i\r
2 = −1\r
together with the following relations:\r
a(ib) = i(a\r
∗\r
b), (ai)b = (ab∗)i, (ia)(bi−1) = (ab)\r
∗\r
(4)\r
for all a, b ∈ A. We make A′into a ∗-algebra using the original conjugation on elements of A and\r
setting i\r
∗ = −i. It is easy to check that every element of A′\r
can be uniquely written as a + ib for\r
some a, b ∈ A, and that this description of the Cayley–Dickson construction becomes equivalent to\r
our previous one if we set (a, b) = a + ib.\r
What is the significance of the relations in (4)? Simply this: they express conjugation in terms\r
of conjugation! This is a pun on the double meaning of the word ‘conjugation’. What I really mean\r
is that they express the ∗ operation in A as conjugation by i. In particular, we have\r
a\r
∗ = (ia)i−1 = i(ai−1\r
)\r
for all a ∈ A. Note that when A′is associative, any one of the relations in (4) implies the other two.\r
It is when A′is nonassociative that we really need all three relations.\r
This interpretation of the Cayley–Dickson construction makes it easier to see what happens as\r
we repeatedly apply the construction starting with R. In R the ∗ operation does nothing, so when\r
we do the Cayley–Dickson construction, conjugation by i must have no effect on elements of R. Since\r
R is commutative, this means that C = R\r
′\r
is commutative. But C is no longer real, since i\r
∗ = −i.\r
Next let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to C. Since C is commutative, the ∗ op\u0002eration in C is an automorphism. Whenever we have an associative algebra A equipped with an\r
automorphism α, we can always extend A to a larger associative algebra by adjoining an invertible\r
element x with\r
α(a) = xax−1\r
for all a ∈ A. Since C is associative, this means that C\r
′ = H is associative. But since C is not real,\r
H cannot be commutative, since conjugation by the newly adjoined element i must have a nontrivial\r
effect.\r
Finally, let us apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to H. Since H is noncommutative, the ∗\r
operation in H is not an automorphism; it is merely an antiautomorphism. This means we cannot\r
express it as conjugation by some element of a larger associative algebra. Thus H′ = O must be\r
nonassociative.\r

William Clifford invented his algebras in 1876 as an attempt to generalize the quaternions to higher\r
dimensions, and he published a paper about them two years later [23]. Given a real inner product\r
space V , the Clifford algebra Cliff(V ) is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the\r
relations\r
v\r
2 = −kvk2\r
for all v ∈ V . Equivalently, it is the associative algebra freely generated by V modulo the relations\r
vw + wv = −2hv, wi\r
for all v, w ∈ V . If V = R\r
n with its usual inner product, we call this Clifford algebra Cliff(n).\r
Concretely, this is the associative algebra freely generated by n anticommuting square roots of −1.\r
From this we easily see that\r
Cliff(0) = R, Cliff(1) = C, Cliff(2) = H.\r
So far this sequence resembles the iterated Cayley-Dickson construction — but the octonions are not\r
a Clifford algebra, since they are nonassociative. Nonetheless, there is a profound relation between\r
Clifford algebras and normed division algebras. This relationship gives a nice way to prove that\r
R, C, H and O are the only normed dvivision algebras. It is also crucial for understanding the\r
geometrical meaning of the octonions.\r
To see this relation, first suppose K is a normed division algebra. Left multiplication by any\r
element a ∈ K gives an operator\r
La : K → K\r
x 7→ ax.\r
If kak = 1, the operator La is norm-preserving, so it maps the unit sphere of K to itself. Since K\r
is a division algebra, we can find an operator of this form mapping any point on the unit sphere to\r
any other point. The only way the unit sphere in K can have this much symmetry is if the norm\r
on K comes from an inner product. Even better, this inner product is unique, since we can use the\r
polarization identity\r
hx, yi =\r
1\r
2\r
(kx + yk\r
2 − kxk2 − kyk2\r
)\r
to recover it from the norm.\r
Using this inner product, we say an element a ∈ K is imaginary if it is orthogonal to the element\r
1, and we let Im(K) be the space of imaginary elements of K. We can also think of Im(K) as the\r
tangent space of the unit sphere in K at the point 1. This has a nice consequence: since a 7→ La\r
maps the unit sphere in K to the Lie group of orthogonal transformations of K, it must send Im(K)\r
to the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint transformations of K. In short, La is skew-adjoint whenever a is\r
imaginary.\r
The relation to Clifford algebras shows up when we compute the square of La for a ∈ Im(K).\r
We can do this most easily when a has norm 1. Then La is both orthogonal and skew-adjoint. For\r
any orthogonal transformation, we can find some orthonormal basis in which its matrix is block\r
diagonal, built from 2 × 2 blocks that look like this:\r
\u0012\r
cos θ sin θ\r
− sin θ cos θ\r
\u0013\r
and possibly a 1×1 block like this: (1). Such a transformation can only be skew-adjoint if it consists\r
solely of 2 × 2 blocks of this form:\r

Table 2 — Clifford Algebras\r
Starting at dimension 8, something marvelous happens: the table continues in the following fashion:\r
Cliff(n + 8) ∼= Cliff(n) ⊗ R[16].\r
In other words, Cliff(n + 8) consists of 16 × 16 matrices with entries in Cliff(n). This ‘period\u00028’ behavior was discovered by Cartan in 1908 [16], but we will take the liberty of calling it Bott\r
periodicity, since it has a far-ranging set of applications to topology, some of which were discovered\r
by Bott.\r
Since Clifford algebras are built from matrix algebras over R, C and H, it is easy to determine\r
their representations. Every representation is a direct sum of irreducible ones. The only irreducible\r
representation of R[n] is its obvious one via matrix multiplication on R\r
n. Similarly, the only irre\u0002ducible representation of C[n] is the obvious one on C\r
n, and the only irreducible representation of\r
H[n] is the obvious one on Hn.\r
Glancing at the above table, we see that unless n equals 3 or 7 modulo 8, Cliff(n) is a real,\r
complex or quaternionic matrix algebra, so it has a unique irreducible representation. For reasons\r
to be explained later, this irreducible representation is known as the space of pinors and denoted\r
Pn. When n is 3 or 7 modulo 8, the algebra Cliff(n) is a direct sum of two real or quaternionic\r
matrix algebras, so it has two irreducible representations, which we call the positive pinors P\r

Examining this table, we see that in the range of dimensions listed there is an n-dimensional rep\u0002resentation of Cliff(n − 1) only for n = 1, 2, 4, and 8. What about higher dimensions? By Bott\r
periodicity, the irreducible representations of Cliff(n + 8) are obtained by tensoring those of Cliff(n)\r
by R\r
16. This multiplies the dimension by 16, so one can easily check that for n > 8, the irreducible\r
representations of Cliff(n − 1) always have dimension greater than n.\r
It follows that normed division algebras are only possible in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8. Having\r
constructed R, C, H and O, we also know that normed division algebras exist in these dimensions.\r
The only remaining question is whether they are unique. For this it helps to investigate more deeply\r
the relation between normed division algebras and the Cayley-Dickson construction. In what follows,\r
we outline an approach based on ideas in the book by Springer and Veldkamp [90].\r
First, suppose K is a normed division algebra. Then there is a unique linear operator ∗: K → K\r
such that 1∗ = 1 and a\r
∗ = −a for a ∈ Im(K). With some calculation one can prove this makes K\r
into a nicely normed ∗-algebra.\r
Next, suppose that K0 is any subalgebra of the normed division algebra K. It is easy to check\r
that K0 is a nicely normed ∗-algebra in its own right. If K0 is not all of K, we can find an element\r
i ∈ K that is orthogonal to every element of K0. Without loss of generality we shall assume this\r
element has norm 1. Since this element i is orthogonal to 1 ∈ K0, it is imaginary. From the definition\r
of the ∗ operator it follows that i\r
∗ = −i, and from results earlier in this section we have i2 = −1.\r
With further calculation one can show that for all a, a′ ∈ K0 we have\r
a(ia′) = i(a\r
∗\r
a\r
′\r
), (ai)a\r
′ = (aa′∗)i, (ia)(a′\r
i\r
−1\r
) = (aa′)\r
∗\r
A glance at equation (4) reveals that these are exactly the relations defining the Cayley-Dickson\r
construction! With a little thought, it follows that the subalgebra of K generated by K0 and i is\r
isomorphic as a ∗-algebra to K′\r
0\r
, the ∗-algebra obtained from K0 by the Cayley-Dickson construction.\r
Thus, whenever we have a normed division algebra K we can find a chain of subalgebras R =\r
K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Kn = K such that Ki+1 ∼= K′\r
i\r
. To construct Ki+1, we simply need to choose a\r
norm-one element of K that is orthogonal to every element of Ki. It follows that the only normed\r
division algebras of dimension 1, 2, 4 and 8 are R, C, H and O. This also gives an alternate proof\r
that there are no normed division algebras of other dimensions: if there were any, there would have\r
to be a 16-dimensional one, namely O′ — the sedenions. But as mentioned in Section 2.2, one can\r
check explicitly that the sedenions are not a division algebra."""

∗\r
3 with the same vector\r
e ∈ V . We thus obtain a product\r
m: V × V → V\r
for which e is the left and right unit. Since left or right multiplication by any nonzero element is an\r
isomorphism, V is actually a division algebra! Conversely, any division algebra gives a triality.\r
It follows from Theorem 3 that trialities only occur in dimensions 1, 2, 4, or 8. This theorem\r
is quite deep. By comparison, Hurwitz’s classification of normed division algebras is easy to prove.\r
Not surprisingly, these correspond to a special sort of triality, which we call a ‘normed’ triality.\r
To be precise, a normed triality consists of inner product spaces V1, V2, V3 equipped with a\r
trilinear map t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R with\r
|t(v1, v2, v3)| ≤ kv1k kv2k kv3k,\r
and such that for all v1, v2 there exists v3 6= 0 for which this bound is attained — and similarly for\r
cyclic permutations of 1, 2, 3. Given a normed triality, picking unit vectors in any two of the spaces\r
Vi allows us to identify all three spaces and get a normed division algebra. Conversely, any normed\r
division algebra gives a normed triality.\r
But where do normed trialities come from? They come from the theory of spinors! From\r
Section 2.3, we already know that any n-dimensional normed division algebra is a representation\r
of Cliff(n − 1), so it makes sense to look for normed trialities here. In fact, representations of\r
Cliff(n − 1) give certain representations of Spin(n), the double cover of the rotation group in n\r
dimensions. These are called ‘spinors’. As we shall see, the relation between spinors and vectors\r
gives a nice way to construct normed trialities in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8.\r
To see how this works, first let Pin(n) be the group sitting inside Cliff(n) that consists of all\r
products of unit vectors in R\r
n. This group is a double cover of the orthogonal group O(n), where\r
given any unit vector v ∈ R\r
n, we map both ±v ∈ Pin(n) to the element of O(n) that reflects across\r
the hyperplane perpendicular to v. Since every element of O(n) is a product of reflections, this\r
homomorphism is indeed onto.\r
Next, let Spin(n) ⊂ Pin(n) be the subgroup consisting of all elements that are a product of an\r
even number of unit vectors in R\r
n\r
. An element of O(n) has determinant 1 iff it is the product of an\r
even number of reflections, so just as Pin(n) is a double cover of O(n), Spin(n) is a double cover of\r
SO(n). Together with a French dirty joke which we shall not explain, this analogy is the origin of\r
the terms ‘Pin’ and ‘pinor’.\r
Since Pin(n) sits inside Cliff(n), the irreducible representations of Cliff(n) restrict to representa\u0002tions of Pin(n), which turn out to be still irreducible. These are again called pinors, and we know\r
what they are from Table 3. Similarly, Spin(n) sits inside the subalgebra\r
Cliff0(n) ⊆ Cliff(n)\r
consisting of all linear combinations of products of an even number of vectors in R\r
n. Thus the\r
irreducible representations of Cliff0(n) restrict to representations of Spin(n), which turn out to be\r
still irreducible. These are called spinors — but we warn the reader that this term is also used for\r
many slight variations on this concept."""

Sn+8 ∼= Sn ⊗ R\r
16\r
and similarly for right-handed and left-handed spinors.\r
Now, besides its pinor representation(s), the group Pin(n) also has an irreducible representation\r
where we first apply the 2–1 homomorphism Pin(n) → O(n) and then use the obvious representation\r
of O(n) on R\r
n. We call this the vector representation, Vn. As a vector space Vn is just Rn, and\r
Cliff(n) is generated by R\r
n, so we have an inclusion\r
Vn ֒→ Cliff(n).\r
Using this, we can restrict the action of the Clifford algebra on pinors to a map\r
mn: Vn × P\r
±\r

This map is actually an intertwining operator between representations of Pin(n). If we restrict the\r

These trilinear maps are candidates for trialities! However, they can only be trialities when the\r
dimension of the vector representation matches that of the relevant spinor representations. In the\r
range of the above table this happens only for n = 1, 2, 4, 8. In these cases we actually do get normed\r
trialities, which in turn give normed division algebras:\r
t1: V1 × S1 × S1 → R gives R.\r
t2: V2 × S2 × S2 → R gives C.\r

4 × S\r

4 → R gives H.\r
t8: V8 × S\r
+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → R gives O.\r
In higher dimensions, the spinor representations become bigger than the vector representation, so\r
we get no more trialities this way — and of course, none exist.\r
Of the four normed trialities, the one that gives the octonions has an interesting property that\r
the rest lack. To see this property, one must pay careful attention to the difference between a normed\r
triality and a normed division algebra. To construct a normed division K algebra from the normed\r
triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R, we must arbitrarily choose unit vectors in two of the three spaces, so\r
the symmetry group of K is smaller than that of t. More precisely, let us define a automorphism\r
of the normed triality t: V1 × V2 × V3 → R to be a triple of norm–preserving maps fi: Vi → Vi such\r
that\r
t(f1(v1), f2(v2), f3(v3)) = t(v1, v2, v3)\r
for all vi ∈ Vi. These automorphisms form a group we call Aut(t). If we construct a normed division\r
algebra K from t by choosing unit vectors e1 ∈ V1, e2 ∈ V2, we have\r
Aut(K) ∼= {(f1, f2, f3) ∈ Aut(t) : f1(e1) = e1, f2(e2) = e2}.\r
In particular, it turns out that:\r
1 ∼= Aut(R) ⊆ Aut(t1) ∼= {(g1, g2, g3) ∈ O(1)3: g1g2g3 = 1}\r

another name for the automorphism group of the octonions; we shall study this group in Section 4.1.\r
The bigger group Spin(8) acts as automorphisms of the triality that gives the octonions, and it does\r
so in an interesting way. Given any element g ∈ Spin(8), there exist unique elements g± ∈ Spin(8)\r

In general, outer automorphisms of simple Lie groups come from symmetries of their Dynkin\r

Here the three outer nodes correspond to the vector, left-handed spinor and right-handed spinor\r

[17], who called these symmetries triality. The more general notion of ‘triality’ we have been\r
discussing here came later, and is apparently due to Adams [2].\r
The construction of division algebras from trialities has tantalizing links to physics. In the\r

described by a trilinear map involving two spinors and one vector. This map is often drawn as a\r
Feynman diagram:\r
where the straight lines denote spinors and the wiggly one denotes a vector. The most familiar\r
example is the process whereby an electron emits or absorbs a photon.\r
It is fascinating that the same sort of mathematics can be used both to construct the normed\r
division algebras and to describe the interaction between matter and forces. Could this be important\r
for physics? One prima facie problem with this speculation is that physics uses spinors associated to\r
Lorentz groups rather than rotation groups, due to the fact that spacetime has a Lorentzian rather\r
than Euclidean metric. However, in Section 3.3 we describe a way around this problem. Just as\r
octonions give the spinor representations of Spin(8), pairs of octonions give the spinor representations\r
of Spin(9, 1). This is one reason so many theories of physics work best when spacetime is 10-\r
dimensional! Examples include superstring theory [29, 46], supersymmetric gauge theories [35, 65,\r
85], and Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C⊗H⊗O, in which\r
the 3 forces arise naturally from the three factors in this tensor product [31]."""

Projective geometry is a venerable subject that has its origins in the study of perspective by Re\u0002naissance painters. As seen by the eye, parallel lines — e.g., train tracks — appear to meet at a\r
‘point at infinity’. When one changes ones viewpoint, distances and angles appear to change, but\r
points remain points and lines remain lines. These facts suggest a modification of Euclidean plane\r
geometry, based on a set of points, a set of lines, and relation whereby a point ‘lies on’ a line,\r
satisfying the following axioms:\r
• For any two distinct points, there is a unique line on which they both lie.\r
• For any two distinct lines, there is a unique point which lies on both of them.\r
17

• There exist four points, no three of which lie on the same line.\r
• There exist four lines, no three of which have the same point lying on them.\r
A structure satisfying these axioms is called a projective plane. Part of the charm of this definition\r
is that it is ‘self-dual’: if we switch the words ‘point’ and ‘line’ and switch who lies on whom, it\r
stays the same.\r
We have already met one example of a projective plane in Section 2.1: the smallest one of all, the\r
Fano plane. The example relevant to perspective is the real projective plane, RP2. Here the points\r
are lines through the origin in R\r
3\r
, the lines are planes through the origin in R\r
3\r
, and the relation of\r
‘lying on’ is taken to be inclusion. Each point (x, y) ∈ R\r
2 determines a point in RP2\r
, namely the\r
line in R\r
3\r
containing the origin and the point (x, y, −1):\r
(0,0,0)\r
( , ,−1) x y\r
There are also other points in RP2, the ‘points at infinity’, corresponding to lines through the origin\r
in R\r
3\r
that do not intersect the plane {z = −1}. For example, any point on the horizon in the above\r
picture determines a point at infinity.\r
Projective geometry is also interesting in higher dimensions. One can define a projective space\r
by the following axioms:\r
• For any two distinct points p, q, there is a unique line pq on which they both lie.\r
• For any line, there are at least three points lying on this line.\r
• If a, b, c, d are distinct points and there is a point lying on both ab and cd, then there is a point\r
lying on both ac and bd.\r
Given a projective space and a set S of points in this space, we define the span of S to be the\r
smallest set T of points containing S such that if a and b lie in T , so do all points on the line ab.\r
The dimension of a projective space is defined to be one less than the minimal cardinality of a set\r
that spans the whole space. The reader may enjoy showing that a 2-dimensional projective space is\r
the same thing as a projective plane [44].\r
If K is any field, there is an n-dimensional projective space called KPn where the points are lines\r
through the origin in Kn+1, the lines are planes through the origin in Kn+1, and the relation of\r
‘lying on’ is inclusion. In fact, this construction works even when K is a mere skew field: a ring\r
such that every nonzero element has a left and right multiplicative inverse. We just need to be a bit\r
careful about defining lines and planes through the origin in Kn+1. To do this, we use the fact that\r
Kn+1 is a K-bimodule in an obvious way. We take a line through the origin to be any set\r
L = {αx : α ∈ K}\r
where x ∈ Kn+1 is nonzero, and take a plane through the origin to be any set\r
P = {αx + βy : α, β ∈ K}\r
18

where x, y ∈ Kn+1 are elements such that αx + βy = 0 implies α, β = 0.\r
Given this example, the question naturally arises whether every projective n-space is of the form\r
KPnfor some skew field K. The answer is quite surprising: yes, but only if n > 2. Projective planes\r
are more subtle [91]. A projective plane comes from a skew field if and only if it satisfies an extra\r
axiom, the ‘axiom of Desargues’, which goes as follows. Define a triangle to be a triple of points\r
that don’t all lie on the same line. Now, suppose we have two triangles xyz and x\r
′y′\r
z\r
′\r
. The sides of\r
each triangle determine three lines, say LMN and L\r
′M′N′\r
. Sometimes the line through x and x\r
′\r
,\r
the line through y and y\r
′\r
, and the line through z and z\r
′ will all intersect at the same point:\r
x\r
y\r
M\r
L\r
N\r
y\r
z\r
z\r
x\r
L\r
N\r
M\r
The axiom of Desargues says that whenever this happens, something else happens: the intersec\u0002tion of L and L\r
′\r
, the intersection of M and M′, and the intersection of N and N′ all lie on the same\r
line:\r
N\r
M\r
L\r
L\r
N\r
M\r
This axiom holds automatically for projective spaces of dimension 3 or more, but not for projective\r
planes. A projective plane satisfying this axiom is called Desarguesian.\r
The axiom of Desargues is pretty, but what is its connection to skew fields? Suppose we start\r
with a projective plane P and try to reconstruct a skew field from it. We can choose any line L,\r
choose three distinct points on this line, call them 0, 1, and ∞, and set K = L − {∞}. Copying\r
geometric constructions that work when P = RP2, we can define addition and multiplication of\r
points in K. In general the resulting structure (K, +, 0, ·, 1) will not be a skew field. Even worse, it\r
will depend in a nontrivial way on the choices made. However, if we assume the axiom of Desargues,\r
these problems go away. We thus obtain a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes\r
of skew fields and isomorphism classes of Desarguesian projective planes.\r
Projective geometry was very fashionable in the 1800s, with such worthies as Poncelet, Brianchon,\r
Steiner and von Staudt making important contributions. Later it was overshadowed by other forms\r
of geometry. However, work on the subject continued, and in 1933 Ruth Moufang constructed a\r
remarkable example of a non-Desarguesian projective plane using the octonions [74]. As we shall\r
see, this projective plane deserves the name OP2.\r
The 1930s also saw the rise of another reason for interest in projective geometry: quantum\r
mechanics! Quantum theory is distressingly different from the classical Newtonian physics we have\r
19

learnt to love. In classical mechanics, observables are described by real-valued functions. In quantum\r
mechanics, they are often described by hermitian n×n complex matrices. In both cases, observables\r
are closed under addition and multiplication by real scalars. However, in quantum mechanics,\r
observables do not form an associative algebra. Still, one can raise an observable to a power, and\r
from squaring one can construct a commutative but nonassociative product:\r
a ◦ b =\r
1\r
2\r
((a + b)\r
2 − a2 − b2\r
) = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba).\r
In 1932, Pascual Jordan attempted to understand this situation better by isolating the bare minimum\r
axioms that an ‘algebra of observables’ should satisfy [57]. He invented the definition of what is now\r
called a formally real Jordan algebra: a commutative and power-associative algebra satisfying\r
a\r
2\r
1 + · · · + a\r
2\r
n = 0 =⇒ a1 = · · · = an = 0\r
for all n. The last condition gives the algebra a partial ordering: if we write a ≤ b when the element\r
b − a is a sum of squares, it says that a ≤ b and b ≤ a imply a = b. Though it is not obvious, any\r
formally real Jordan algebra satisfies the identity\r
a ◦ (b ◦ a\r
2\r
) = (a ◦ b) ◦ a\r
2\r
for all elements a and b. Any commutative algebra satisfying this identity is called a Jordan\r
algebra. Jordan algebras are automatically power-associative.\r
In 1934, Jordan published a paper with von Neumann and Wigner classifying all formally real\r
Jordan algebras [59]. The classification is nice and succinct. An ideal in the Jordan algebra A is a\r
subspace B ⊆ A such that b ∈ B implies a ◦ b ∈ B for all a ∈ A. A Jordan algebra A is simple if its\r
only ideals are {0} and A itself. Every formally real Jordan algebra is a direct sum of simple ones.\r
The simple formally real Jordan algebras consist of 4 infinite families and one exception."""

Here we say a square matrix with entries in the ∗-algebra A is hermitian if it equals its conjugate\r
transpose, and we let hn(A) stand for the hermitian n×n matrices with entries in A. Jordan algebras\r
in the fourth family are called spin factors, while h3(O) is called the exceptional Jordan algebra.\r
This classification raises some obvious questions. Why does nature prefer the Jordan algebras hn(C)\r
over all the rest? Or does it? Could the other Jordan algebras — even the exceptional one — have\r
some role to play in quantum physics? Despite much research, these questions remain unanswered\r
to this day.\r
The paper by Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner appears to have been uninfluenced by Moufang’s\r
discovery of OP2, but in fact they are related. A projection in a formally real Jordan algebra is\r
defined to be an element p with p\r
2 = p. In the familiar case of hn(C), these correspond to hermitian\r
matrices with eigenvalues 0 and 1, so they are used to describe observables that assume only two\r
values — e.g., ‘true’ and ‘false’. This suggests treating projections in a formally real Jordan algebra\r
as propositions in a kind of ‘quantum logic’. The partial order helps us do this: given projections p\r
and q, we say that p ‘implies’ q if p ≤ q.\r
20

The relation between Jordan algebras and quantum logic is already interesting [34], but the\r
real fun starts when we note that projections in hn(C) correspond to subspaces of C\r
n. This sets\r
up a relationship to projective geometry [98], since the projections onto 1-dimensional subspaces\r
correspond to points in CPn, while the projections onto 2-dimensional subspaces correspond to\r
lines. Even better, we can work out the dimension of a subspace V ⊆ C\r
n\r
from the corresponding\r
projection p: C\r
n → V using only the partial order on projections: V has dimension d iff the longest\r
chain of distinct projections\r
0 = p0 < · · · < pi = p\r
has length i = d. In fact, we can use this to define the rank of a projection in any formally\r
real Jordan algebra. We can then try to construct a projective space whose points are the rank-1\r
projections and whose lines are the rank-2 projections, with the relation of ‘lying on’ given by the\r
partial order ≤.\r
If we try this starting with hn(R), hn(C) or hn(H), we succeed when n ≥ 2, and we obtain the\r
projective spaces RPn, CPnand HPn, respectively. If we try this starting with the spin factor R\r
n⊕R\r
we succeed when n ≥ 2, and obtain a series of 1-dimensional projective spaces related to Lorentzian\r
geometry. Finally, in 1949 Jordan [58] discovered that if we try this construction starting with the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra, we get the projective plane discovered by Moufang: OP2.\r
In what follows we describe the octonionic projective plane and exceptional Jordan algebra in\r
more detail. But first let us consider the octonionic projective line, and the Jordan algebra h2(O)."""

A one-dimensional projective space is called a projective line. Projective lines are not very inter\u0002esting from the viewpoint of axiomatic projective geometry, since they have only one line on which\r
all the points lie. Nonetheless, they can be geometrically and topologically interesting. This is\r
especially true of the octonionic projective line. As we shall see, this space has a deep connection\r
to Bott periodicity, and also to the Lorentzian geometry of 10-dimensional spacetime.\r
Suppose K is a normed division algebra. We have already defined KP1 when K is associative,\r
but this definition does not work well for the octonions: it is wiser to take a detour through Jordan\r
algebras. Let h2(K) be the space of 2 × 2 hermitian matrices with entries in K. It is easy to check\r
that this becomes a Jordan algebra with the product a ◦ b =\r
1\r
2\r
(ab + ba). We can try to build a\r
projective space from this Jordan algebra using the construction in the previous section. To see if\r
this succeeds, we need to ponder the projections in h2(K). A little calculation shows that besides\r
the trivial projections 0 and 1, they are all of the form\r
\u0012\r
x\r
∗\r
y\r

where (x, y) ∈ K2 has\r
kxk\r
2 + kyk2 = 1.\r
These nontrivial projections all have rank 1, so they are the points of our would–be projective space.\r
Our would–be projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1, and all the points\r
lie on this line. It is easy to check that the axioms for a projective space hold. Since this projective\r
space is 1-dimensional, we have succeeded in creating the projective line over K. We call the set\r
of points of this projective line KP1.\r
Given any nonzero element (x, y) ∈ K2, we can normalize it and then use the above formula to\r
get a point in KP1, which we call [(x, y)]. This allows us to describe KP1in terms of lines through\r
the origin, as follows. Define an equivalence relation on nonzero elements of K2 by\r
(x, y) ∼ (x\r
′\r
, y′) ⇐⇒ [(x, y)] = [(x\r
′\r
, y′)]."""

number = "21"
title = "We call an equivalence class for this relation a line through the origin in K2"

. We can then identify\r
points in KP1 with lines through the origin in K2.\r
Be careful: when K is the octonions, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is not always\r
equal to\r
{(αx, αy) : α ∈ K}.\r
This is only true when K is associative, or when x or y is 1. Luckily, we have (x, y) ∼ (y\r
−1x, 1)\r
when y 6= 0 and (x, y) ∼ (1, x−1y) when x 6= 0. Thus in either case we get a concrete description of\r
the line through the origin containing (x, y): when x 6= 0 it equals\r
{(α(y\r
−1x), α) : α ∈ K},\r
and when y 6= 0 it equals\r
{(α, α(x\r
−1\r
y) : α ∈ K}.\r
In particular, the line through the origin containing (x, y) is always a real vector space isomorphic\r
to K.\r
We can make KP1into a manifold as follows. By the above observations, we can cover it with\r
two coordinate charts: one containing all points of the form [(x, 1)], the other containing all points\r
of the form [(1, y)]. It is easy to check that [(x, 1)] = [(1, y)] iff y = x\r
−1\r
, so the transition function\r
from the first chart to the second is the map x 7→ x\r
−1\r
. Since this transition function and its inverse\r
are smooth on the intersection of the two charts, KP1becomes a smooth manifold.\r
When pondering the geometry of projective lines it is handy to visualize the complex case, since\r
CP1is just the familiar ‘Riemann sphere’. In this case, the map\r
x 7→ [(x, 1)]\r
is given by stereographic projection:\r
x\r
[ ,1] x\r
0\r
where we choose the sphere to have diameter 1. This map from C to CP1is one-to-one and almost\r
onto, missing only the point at infinity, or ‘north pole’. Similarly, the map\r
y 7→ [(1, y)]\r
misses only the south pole. Composing the first map with the inverse of the second, we get the\r
map x 7→ x\r
−1\r
, which goes by the name of ‘conformal inversion’. The southern hemisphere of the\r
Riemann sphere consists of all points [(x, 1)] with kxk ≤ 1, while the northern hemisphere consists\r
of all [(1, y)] with kyk ≤ 1. Unit complex numbers x give points [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1)] on the equator.\r
All these ideas painlessly generalize to KP1for any normed division algebra K. First of all, as a\r
smooth manifold KP1is just a sphere with dimension equal to that of K:\r

We can think of it as the one-point compactification of K. The ‘southern hemisphere’, ‘northern\r
hemisphere’, and ‘equator’ of K have descriptions exactly like those given above for the complex\r
case. Also, as in the complex case, the maps x 7→ [(x, 1)] and y 7→ [(1, y)] are angle-preserving with\r
respect to the usual Euclidean metric on K and the round metric on the sphere.\r
One of the nice things about KP1is that it comes equipped with a vector bundle whose fiber over\r
the point [(x, y)] is the line through the origin corresponding to this point. This bundle is called the\r
canonical line bundle, LK. Of course, when we are working with a particular division algebra,\r
‘line’ means a copy of this division algebra, so if we think of them as real vector bundles, LR, LC, LH\r
and LO have dimensions 1,2,4, and 8, respectively.\r
These bundles play an important role in topology, so it is good to understand them in a number\r
of ways. In general, any k-dimensional real vector bundle over S\r
n can be formed by taking trivial\r
bundles over the northern and southern hemispheres and gluing them together along the equator via\r
a map f: S\r
n−1 → O(k). We must therefore be able to build the canonical line bundles LR, LC, LH\r
and LO using maps\r
fR: S\r
0 → O(1)\r
fC: S\r
1 → O(2)\r
fH: S\r
3 → O(4)\r
fO: S\r
7 → O(8).\r
What are these maps? We can describe them all simultaneously. Suppose K is a normed division\r
algebra of dimension n. In the southern hemisphere of KP1, we can identify any fiber of LK with K\r
by mapping the point (αx, α) in the line [(x, 1)] to the element α ∈ K. This trivializes the canonical\r
line bundle over the southern hemisphere. Similarly, we can trivialize this bundle over the northern\r
hemisphere by mapping the point (β, βy) in the line [(1, y)] to the element β ∈ K. If x ∈ K has\r
norm one, [(x, 1)] = [(1, x−1)] is a point on the equator, so we get two trivializations of the fiber\r
over this point. These are related as follows: if (αx, α) = (β, βx−1) then β = αx. The map α 7→ β\r
is thus right multiplication by x. In short,\r
fK: S\r
n−1 → O(n)\r
is just the map sending any norm-one element x ∈ K to the operation of right multiplication by x.\r
The importance of the map fK becomes clearest if we form the inductive limit of the groups O(n)\r
using the obvious inclusions O(n) ֒→ O(n + 1), obtaining a topological group called O(∞). Since\r
O(n) is included in O(∞), we can think of fK as a map from S\r
n−1\r
to O(∞). Its homotopy class\r
[fK] has the following marvelous property, mentioned in the Introduction:\r
• [fR] generates π0(O(∞)) ∼= Z2.\r
• [fC] generates π1(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
• [fH] generates π3(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
• [fO] generates π7(O(∞)) ∼= Z.\r
Another nice perspective on the canonical line bundles LK comes from looking at their unit\r
sphere bundles. Any fiber of LK is naturally an inner product space, since it is a line through the\r
origin in K2. If we take the unit sphere in each fiber, we get a bundle of (n − 1)-spheres over KP1\r
called the Hopf bundle:\r
pK: EK → KP1\r
The projection pK is called the Hopf map. The total space EK consists of all the unit vectors in"""

, so it is a sphere of dimension 2n − 1. In short, the Hopf bundles look like this:\r
K = R : S\r
0\r
֒→ S\r
1 → S1\r
K = C : S\r
1\r
֒→ S\r
3 → S2\r
K = H : S\r
3\r
֒→ S\r
7 → S4\r
K = O : S\r
7\r
֒→ S\r
15 → S8\r
We can understand the Hopf maps better by thinking about inverse images of points. The inverse\r
image p\r
−1\r
K\r
(x) of any point x ∈ S\r
n\r
is a (n − 1)-sphere in S\r
2n−1\r
, and the inverse image of any pair\r
of distinct points is a pair of linked spheres of this sort. When K = C we get linked circles in S\r
3\r
,\r
which form the famous Hopf link:\r
When K = O, we get a pair of linked 7-spheres in S\r
15\r
.\r
To quantify this notion of linking, we can use the ‘Hopf invariant’. Suppose for a moment that\r
n is any natural number greater than one, and let f: S\r
2n−1 → Sn be any smooth map. If ω is the\r
normalized volume form on S\r
n, then f∗ω is a closed n-form on S2n−1\r
. Since the nth cohomology of\r
S\r
2n−1 vanishes, f∗ω = dα for some (n − 1)-form α. We define the Hopf invariant of f to be the\r
number\r
H(f) = Z\r
S2n−1\r
α ∧ dα.\r
This is easily seen to be invariant under smooth homotopies of the map f.\r
To see how the Hopf invariant is related to linking, we can compute it using homology rather than\r
cohomology. If we take any two regular values of f, say x and y, the inverse images of these points\r
are compact oriented (n−1)-dimensional submanifolds of S\r
2n−1\r
. We can always find an oriented n\u0002dimensional submanifold X ⊂ S\r
2n−1\r
that has boundary equal to f\r
−1\r
(x) and that intersects f\r
−1\r
(y)\r
transversely. The dimensions of X and f\r
−1\r
(y) add up to 2n−1, so their intersection number is well\u0002defined. By the duality between homology and cohomology, this number equals the Hopf invariant\r
H(f). This shows that the Hopf invariant is an integer. Moreover, it shows that when the Hopf\r
invariant is nonzero, the inverse images of x and y are linked.\r
Using either of these approaches we can compute the Hopf invariant of pC, pH and pO. They all\r
turn out to have Hopf invariant 1. This implies, for example, that the inverse images of distinct\r
points under pO are nontrivially linked 7-spheres in S"""

many related ‘period-8’ phenomena that go by the name of Bott periodicity. The appearance of\r

marvelous fact is somewhat under-appreciated, it seems worthwhile to say a bit about it. Here we\r
shall focus on those aspects that are related to OP1and the canonical octonionic line bundle over\r
this space.\r
Let us start with K-theory. This is a way of gaining information about a topological space by\r
studying the vector bundles over it. If the space has holes in it, there will be nontrivial vector\r
bundles that have ‘twists’ as we go around these holes. The simplest example is the ‘M¨obius strip’\r

K-theory tells us to study the vector bundles over a topological space X by constructing an\r
abelian group as follows. First, take the set consisting of all isomorphism classes of real vector\r
bundles over X. Our ability to take direct sums of vector bundles gives this set an ‘addition’\r
operation making it into a commutative monoid. Next, adjoin formal ‘additive inverses’ for all the\r
elements of this set, obtaining an abelian group. This group is called KO(X), the real K-theory\r
of X. Alternatively we could start with complex vector bundles and get a group called K(X), but\r
here we will be interested in real vector bundles.\r
Any real vector bundle E over X gives an element [E] ∈ KO(X), and these elements generate\r
this group. If we pick a point in X, there is an obvious homomorphism dim: KO(X) → Z sending\r
[E] to the dimension of the fiber of E at this point. Since the dimension is a rather obvious and\r
boring invariant of vector bundles, it is nice to work with the kernel of this homomorphism, which is\r
called the reduced real K-theory of X and denoted KOg(X). This is an invariant of pointed spaces,\r
i.e. spaces equipped with a designated point or basepoint.\r
Any sphere becomes a pointed space if we take the north pole as basepoint. The reduced real\r
K-theory of the first eight spheres looks like this:\r
KOg(S\r
1\r
) ∼= Z2\r
KOg(S\r
2\r
) ∼= Z2\r
KOg(S\r
3\r

KOg(S\r

KOg(S\r
5\r

KOg(S\r
6\r
) ∼= 0\r
KOg(S\r
7\r
) ∼= 0\r
KOg(S\r
8\r
) ∼= Z\r
where, as one might guess,\r
• [LR] generates KOg(S\r
1\r
).\r
• [LC] generates KOg(S\r
2\r
).\r
• [LH] generates KOg(S\r
4\r
).\r
• [LO] generates KOg(S\r
8\r
).\r
As mentioned in the previous section, one can build any k-dimensional real vector bundle over\r
S\r
n using a map f: Sn−1 → O(k). In fact, isomorphism classes of such bundles are in one-to-one\r
correspondence with homotopy classes of such maps. Moreover, two such bundles determine the\r
same element of KOg(X) if and only if the corresponding maps become homotopy equivalent after\r
25

we compose them with the inclusion O(k) ֒→ O(∞), where O(∞) is the direct limit of the groups\r
O(k). It follows that\r
KOg(S\r
n\r
) ∼= πn−1(O(∞)).\r
This fact gives us the list of homotopy groups of O(∞) which appears in the Introduction. It also\r
means that to prove Bott periodicity for these homotopy groups:\r
πi+8(O(∞)) ∼= πi(O(∞)),\r
it suffices to prove Bott periodicity for real K-theory:\r
KOg(S\r
n+8) ∼= KOg(Sn\r
).\r
Why do we have Bott periodicity in real K-theory? It turns out that there is a graded ring KO\r
with\r
KOn = KOg(S\r
n\r
).\r
The product in this ring comes from our ability to take ‘smash products’ of spheres and also of real\r
vector bundles over these spheres. Multiplying by [LO] gives an isomorphism\r
KOg(S\r
n) → KOg(Sn+8)\r
x 7→ [LO] x\r
In other words, the canonical octonionic line bundle over OP1generates Bott periodicity!\r
There is much more to say about this fact and how it relates to Bott periodicity for Clifford\r
algebras, but alas, this would take us too far afield. We recommend that the interested reader turn\r
to some introductory texts on K-theory, for example the one by Dale Husemoller [56]. Unfortunately,\r
all the books I know downplay the role of the octonions. To spot it, one must bear in mind the\r
relation between the octonions and Clifford algebras, discussed in Section 2.3 above."""

In Section 3.1 we sketched a systematic approach to projective lines over the normed division alge\u0002bras. The most famous example is the Riemann sphere, CP1\r
. As emphasized by Penrose [77], this\r
space has a fascinating connection to Lorentzian geometry — or in other words, special relativity.\r
All conformal transformations of the Riemann sphere come from fractional linear transformations\r
z 7→\r
az + b\r
cz + d\r
, a, b, c, d ∈ C.\r
It is easy to see that the group of such transformations is isomorphic to PSL(2, C): 2 × 2 complex\r
matrices with determinant 1, modulo scalar multiples of the identity. Less obviously, it is also isomor\u0002phic to the Lorentz group SO0(3, 1): the identity component of the group of linear transformations\r
of R\r
4\r
that preserve the Minkowski metric\r
x · y = x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3 − x4y4.\r
This fact has a nice explanation in terms of the ‘heavenly sphere’. Mathematically, this is the 2-\r
sphere consisting of all lines of the form {αx} where x ∈ R\r
4 has x · x = 0. In special relativity such\r
lines represent light rays, so the heavenly sphere is the sphere on which the stars appear to lie when\r
you look at the night sky. This sphere inherits a conformal structure from the Minkowski metric on\r
R\r
4\r
. This allows us to identify the heavenly sphere with CP1, and it implies that the Lorentz group\r
acts as conformal transformations of CP1. In concrete terms, what this means is that if you shoot\r
past the earth at nearly the speed of light, the constellations in the sky will appear distorted, but\r
all angles will be preserved.\r
26

In fact, these results are not special to the complex case: the same ideas work for the other\r
normed division algebras as well! The algebras R, C, H and O are related to Lorentzian geometry\r
in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions, respectively [68, 69, 70, 85, 93]. Even better, a full explanation of\r
this fact brings out new relationships between the normed division algebras and spinors. In what\r
follows we explain how this works for all 4 normed division algebras, with special attention to the\r
peculiarities of the octonionic case.\r
To set the stage, we first recall the most mysterious of the four infinite series of Jordan algebras\r
listed at the beginning of Section 3: the spin factors. We described these quite concretely, but a more\r
abstract approach brings out their kinship to Clifford algebras. Given an n-dimensional real inner\r
product space V , let the spin factor J(V ) be the Jordan algebra freely generated by V modulo\r
relations\r
v\r
2 = kvk2\r
.\r
Polarizing and applying the commutative law, we obtain\r
v ◦ w = hv, wi,\r
so J(V ) is isomorphic to V ⊕ R with the product\r
(v, α) ◦ (w, β) = (αw + βv,hv, wi + αβ).\r
Though Jordan algebras were invented to study quantum mechanics, the spin factors are also\r
deeply related to special relativity. We can think of J(V ) ∼= V ⊕ R as Minkowksi spacetime, with\r
V as space and R as time. The reason is that J(V ) is naturally equipped with a symmetric bilinear\r
form of signature (n, 1), the Minkowski metric:\r
(v, α) · (w, β) = hv, wi − αβ.\r
The group of linear transformations preserving the Minkowski metric is called O(n, 1), and the\r
identity component of this is called the Lorentz group, SO0(n, 1). We define the lightcone C(V )\r
to consist of all nonzero x ∈ J(V ) with x · x = 0. A 1-dimensional subspace of J(V ) spanned by an\r
element of the lightcone is called a light ray, and the space of all light rays is called the heavenly\r
sphere S(V ). We can identify the heavenly sphere with the unit sphere in V , since every light ray\r
is spanned by an element of the form (v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. Here is a picture of the\r
lightcone and the heavenly sphere when V is 2-dimensional:\r
C( ) V\r
S( ) V\r
V\r
When V is at least 2-dimensional, we can build a projective space from the Jordan algebra J(V ).\r
The result is none other than the heavenly sphere! To see this, note that aside from the elements 0\r
and 1, all projections in J(V ) are of the form p =\r
1\r
2\r
(v, 1) where v ∈ V has norm one. These are the\r
points of our projective space, but as we have seen, they also correspond to points of the heavenly\r
sphere. Our projective space has just one line, corresponding to the projection 1 ∈ J(V ). We can\r
visualize this line as the heavenly sphere itself.\r
27

What does all this have to do with normed division algebras? To answer this, let K be a normed\r
division algebra of dimension n. Then the Jordan algebra h2(K) is secretly a spin factor! There is\r
an isomorphism\r
φ: h2(K) → J(K ⊕ R) ∼= K ⊕ R ⊕ R\r
given by\r
φ\r
\u0012\r
α + β x\r
x\r
∗ α − β\r
\u0013\r
= (x, β, α), x ∈ K, α, β ∈ R. (6)\r
Furthermore, the determinant of matrices in h2(K) is well-defined even when K is noncommutative\r
or nonassociative:\r
det \u0012\r
α + β x\r
x\r
∗ α − β\r
\u0013\r
= α\r
2 − β2 − kxk2\r
,\r
and clearly we have\r
det(a) = −φ(a) · φ(a)\r
for all a ∈ h2(K).\r
These facts have a number of nice consequences. First of all, since the Jordan algebras J(K ⊕ R)\r
and h2(K) are isomorphic, so are their associated projective spaces. We have seen that the former\r
space is the heavenly sphere S(K ⊕ R), and that the latter is KP1. It follows that\r
KP1 ∼= S(K ⊕ R).\r
This gives another proof of something we already saw in Section 3.1: KP1is an n-sphere. But it\r
shows more. The Lorentz group SO0(n+ 1, 1) has an obvious action on the heavenly sphere, and the\r
usual conformal structure on the sphere is invariant under this action. Using the above isomorphism\r
we can transfer this group action and invariant conformal structure to KP1in a natural way.\r
Secondly, it follows that the determinant-preserving linear transformations of h2(K) form a group\r
isomorphic to O(n + 1, 1). How can we find some transformations of this sort? If K = R, this is\r
easy: when g ∈ SL(2, R) and x ∈ h2(R), we again have gxg∗ ∈ h2(R), and\r
det(gxg∗) = det(x).\r
This gives a homomorphism from SL(2, R) to O(2, 1). This homomorphism is two–to–one, since\r
both g = 1 and g = −1 act trivially, and it maps SL(2, R) onto the identity component of O(2, 1). It\r
follows that SL(2, R) is a double cover of SO0(2, 1). The exact same construction works for K = C,\r
so SL(2, C) is a double cover of SO0(3, 1).\r
For the other two normed division algebras the above calculation involving determinants breaks\r
down, and it even becomes tricky to define the group SL(2, K), so we start by working at the Lie\r
algebra level. We say a m × m matrix with entries in the normed division algebra K is traceless if\r
the sum of its diagonal entries is zero. Any such traceless matrix acts as a real–linear operator on\r
Km. When K is commutative and associative, the space of operators coming from m × m traceless\r
matrices with entries in K is closed under commutators, but otherwise it is not, so we define sl(m, K)\r
to be the Lie algebra of operators on Km generated by operators of this form. This Lie algebra in\r
turn generates a Lie group of real-linear operators on Km, which we call SL(m, K). Note that\r
multiplication in this group is given by composition of real-linear operators, which is associative\r
even for K = O.\r
The Lie algebra sl(m, K) comes born with a representation: its fundamental representation\r
as real-linear operators on Km, given by\r
a: x 7→ ax, x ∈ K\r
m\r
whenever a ∈ sl(m, K) actually corresponds to a traceless m×m matrix with entries in K. Tensoring\r
the fundamental representation with its dual, we get a representation of sl(m, K) on the space of\r
matrices K[m], given by\r
a: x 7→ ax + xa∗, x ∈ K[m]\r
28

whenever a is a traceless matrix with entries in K. Since ax + xa∗\r
is hermitian whenever x is, this\r
representation restricts to a representation of sl(m, K) on hm(K). This in turn can be exponentiated\r
to obtain a representation of the group SL(m, K) on hm(K).\r
Now let us return to the case m = 2. One can prove that the representation of SL(2, K) on h2(K)\r
is determinant-preserving simply by checking that\r
d\r
dt det(x + t(ax + xa∗\r
))\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
t=0\r
= 0\r
when x lies in h2(K) and a ∈ K[2] is traceless. Here the crucial thing is to make sure that the\r
calculation is not spoiled by noncommutativity or nonassociativity. It follows that we have a homo\u0002morphism\r
αK: SL(2, K) → SO0(n + 1, 1)\r
One can check that this is onto, and that its kernel consists of the matrices ±1. Thus if we define\r
PSL(2, K) = SL(2, K)/{±1},\r
we get isomorphisms\r
PSL(2, R) ∼= SO0(2, 1)\r
PSL(2, C) ∼= SO0(3, 1)\r
PSL(2, H) ∼= SO0(6, 1)\r
PSL(2, O) ∼= SO0(9, 1).\r
Putting this together with our earlier observations, it follows that PSL(2, K) acts as conformal\r
transformations of KP1.\r
We conclude with some words about how all this relates to spinors. The machinery of Clifford\r
algebras and spinors extends effortlessly from the case of inner product spaces to vector spaces\r
equipped with an indefinite metric. In particular, the Lorentz group SO0(n + 1, 1) has a double\r
cover called Spin(n + 1, 1), and this group has certain representations called spinor representations.\r
When n = 1, 2, 4 or 8, we actually have\r
Spin(n + 1, 1) ∼= SL(2, K)\r
where K is the normed division algebra of dimension n. The fundamental representation of SL(2, K)\r
on K2is the left-handed spinor representation of Spin(n + 1, 1). Its dual is the right-handed spinor\r
representation. Moreover, the interaction between vectors and spinors that serves as the basis of\r
supersymmetric theories of physics in spacetimes of dimension 3, 4, 6 and 10 is just the action of\r
h2(K) on K2 by matrix multiplication. In a Feynman diagram, this is represented as follows:\r
K2\r
h2(K)\r
K2\r
In the case K = C, Penrose [77] has described a nice trick for getting points on the heavenly\r
sphere from spinors. In fact, it also works for other normed division algebras: if (x, y) ∈ K2is\r
nonzero, the hermitian matrix\r
\u0012\r
x\r
y\r
\u0013\r
\r
x\r
∗ y∗\r

=\r
\u0012\r
xx∗ xy∗\r
yx∗ yy∗\r
\u0013\r
29

is nonzero but has determinant zero, so it defines a point on the heavenly sphere. If we restrict to\r
spinors of norm one, this trick reduces to the Hopf map. Moreover, it clarifies the curious double role\r
of KP1as both the heavenly sphere in special relativity and a space of propositions in the quantum\r
logic associated to the Jordan algebra h2(K): any point on the heavenly sphere corresponds to a\r
proposition specifying the state of a spinor!"""

The octonions are fascinating in themselves, but the magic really starts when we use them to\r
construct the exceptional Jordan algebra h3(O) and its associated projective space, the octonionic\r
projective plane. The symmetry groups of these structures turn out to be exceptional Lie groups, and\r
triality gains an eerie pervasive influence over the proceedings, since an element of h3(O) consists of\r
3 octonions and 3 real numbers. Using the relation between normed division algebras and trialities,\r
we get an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R\r
3 ⊕ V8 ⊕ S\r

8 ⊕ S\r

\r
\r

y x∗ γ\r
\r
 7→ ((α, β, γ), x, y, z)\r
(7)\r
where α, β, γ ∈ R and x, y, z ∈ O. Examining the Jordan product in h3(O) then reveals a wonderful\r
fact: while superficially this product is defined using the ∗-algebra structure of O, it can actually be\r
defined using only the natural maps\r
V8 × S\r
+\r
8 → S\r

−\r
8 → S\r
+\r
8\r
, S+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → V8\r
together with the inner products on these 3 spaces. All this information is contained in the normed\r
triality\r
t8: V8 × S\r
+\r
8 × S\r
−\r
8 → R,\r
so any automorphism of this triality gives a automorphism of h3(O). In Section 2.4 we saw that\r
Aut(t8) ∼= Spin(8). With a little thought, it follows that\r
Spin(8) ⊆ Aut(h3(O)).\r
However, this picture of h3(O) in terms of 8-dimensional Euclidean geometry is just part of a\r
bigger picture — a picture set in 10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime! If we regard h2(O) as sitting\r
in the lower right-hand corner of h3(O), we get an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R ⊕ h2(O) ⊕ O2\r
\u0012\r
α ψ∗\r
ψ a \u0013\r
7→ (α, a, ψ)\r
(8)\r
We saw in Section 3.3 that a ∈ h2(O) and ψ ∈ O2can be identified with a vector and a spinor in\r
10-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, respectively. Similarly, α is a scalar.\r
This picture gives a representation of Spin(9, 1) as linear transformations of h3(O). Unfortunately,\r
most of these transformations do not preserve the Jordan product on h3(O). As we shall see, they\r
only preserve a lesser structure on h3(O): the determinant. However, the transformations coming\r
from the subgroup Spin(9) ⊂ Spin(9, 1) do preserve the Jordan product. We can see this as follows.\r
As a representation of Spin(9), h2(O) splits into ‘space’ and ‘time’:\r
h2(O) ∼= V9 ⊕ R\r
30

with the two pieces corresponding to the traceless elements of h2(O) and the real multiples of the\r
identity, respectively. On the other hand, the spinor representation of so(9) splits as S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8 when\r
we restrict it to so(8), so we have\r
O\r
2 ∼= S9.\r
We thus obtain an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= R\r
2 ⊕ V9 ⊕ S9\r
\u0012\r
α ψ∗\r
ψ a + β\r
\u0013\r
7→ ((α, β), a, ψ)\r
(9)\r
where a ∈ h2(O) has vanishing trace and β is a real multiple of the identity. In these terms, one can\r
easily check that the Jordan product in h3(O) is built from invariant operations on scalars, vectors\r
and spinors in 9 dimensions. It follows that\r
Spin(9) ⊆ Aut(h3(O)).\r
For more details on this, see Harvey’s book [54].\r
This does not exhaust all the symmetries of h3(O), since there are other automorphisms coming\r
from the permutation group on 3 letters, which acts on (α, β, γ) ∈ R\r
3 and (x, y, z) ∈ O3\r
in an\r
obvious way. Also, any matrix g ∈ O(3) acts by conjugation as an automorphism of h3(O); since\r
the entries of g are real, there is no problem with nonassociativity here. The group Spin(9) is 36-\r
dimensional, but the full automorphism group h3(O) is much bigger: it is 52-dimensional. As we\r
explain in Section 4.2, it goes by the name of F4.\r
However, we can already do something interesting with the automorphisms we have: we can use\r
them to diagonalize any element of h3(O). To see this, first note that the rotation group, and thus\r
Spin(9), acts transitively on the unit sphere in V9. This means we can use an automorphism in our\r
Spin(9) subgroup to bring any element of h3(O) to the form\r
\r
\r
α z∗y\r
∗\r
z β x\r
y x∗ γ\r
\r
\r
where x is real. The next step is to apply an automorphism that makes y and z real while leaving x\r
alone. To do this, note that the subgroup of Spin(9) fixing any nonzero vector in V9 is isomorphic\r
to Spin(8). When we restrict the representation S9 to this subgroup, it splits as S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
, and with\r
some work [54] one can show that Spin(8) acts on S\r
+\r
8 ⊕ S\r
−\r
8\r
∼= O2\r
in such a way that any element\r
(y, z) ∈ O2can be carried to an element with both components real. The final step is to take our\r
element of h3(O) with all real entries and use an automorphism to diagonalize it. We can do this by\r
conjugating it with a suitable matrix in O(3).\r
To understand OP2, we need to understand projections in h3(O). Here is where our ability\r
to diagonalize matrices in h3(O) via automorphisms comes in handy. Up to automorphism, every\r
projection in h3(O) looks like one of these four:\r
p0 =\r
\r
\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p1 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p2 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 1 0\r
0 0 0\r
\r
 , p3 =\r
\r
\r
1 0 0\r
0 1 0\r
0 0 1\r
\r
 .\r
Now, the trace of a matrix in h3(O) is invariant under automorphisms, because we can define it\r
using only the Jordan algebra structure:\r
tr(a) = 1\r
9\r
tr(La), a ∈ h3(O)\r
31

where La is left multiplication by a. It follows that the trace of any projection in h3(O) is 0,1,2, or\r
3. Furthermore, the rank of any projection p ∈ h3(O) equals its trace. To see this, first note that\r
tr(p) ≥ rank(p), since p < q implies tr(p) < tr(q), and the trace goes up by integer steps. Thus we\r
only need show tr(p) ≤ rank(p). For this it suffices to consider the four projections shown above, as\r
both trace and rank are invariant under automorphisms. Since p0 < p1 < p2 < p3, it is clear that\r
for these projections we indeed have tr(p) ≤ rank(p).\r
It follows that the points of the octonionic projective plane are projections with trace 1 in h3(O),\r
while the lines are projections with trace 2. A calculation [54] shows that any projection with trace\r
1 has the form\r
p =\r
\r
\r
x\r
y\r
z\r
\r
\r
\r
x\r
∗ y∗\r
z\r
∗\r
\u0001\r
=\r
\r
\r
xx∗ xy∗ xz∗\r
yx∗ yy∗ yz∗\r
zx∗zy∗zz∗\r
\r
 (10)\r
where (x, y, z) ∈ O3 has\r
(xy)z = x(yz), kxk\r
2 + kyk2 + kzk2 = 1.\r
On the other hand, any projection with trace 2 is of the form 1 − p where p has trace 1. This sets\r
up a one-to-one correspondence between points and lines in the octonionic projective plane. If we\r
use this correspondence to think of both as trace-1 projections, the point p lies on the line p\r
′\r
if\r
and only if p < 1 − p\r
′\r
. Of course, p < 1 − p\r
′\r
iff p\r
′ < 1 − p. The symmetry of this relation means\r
the octonionic projective plane is self-dual! This is also true of the real, complex and quaternionic\r
projective planes. In all cases, the operation that switches points and lines corresponds in quantum\r
logic to the ‘negation’ of propositions [98].\r
We use OP2to stand for the set of points in the octonionic projective plane. Given any nonzero\r
element (x, y, z) ∈ O3 with (xy)z = x(yz), we can normalize it and then use equation (10) to obtain\r
a point [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2. Copying the strategy that worked for OP1, we can make OP2into a smooth\r
manifold by covering it with three coordinate charts:\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(x, y, 1)],\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(x, 1, z)],\r
• one chart containing all points of the form [(1, y, z)].\r
Checking that this works is a simple calculation. The only interesting part is to make sure that\r
whenever the associative law might appear necessary, we can either use the alternativity of the\r
octonions or the fact that only triples with (xy)z = x(yz) give points [(x, y, z)] ∈ OP2.\r
We thus obtain the following picture of the octonionic projective plane. As a manifold, OP2is\r
16-dimensional. The lines in OP2are copies of OP1, and thus 8-spheres. For any two distinct points\r
in OP2, there is a unique line on which they both lie. For any two distinct lines, there is a unique\r
point lying on both of them. There is a ‘duality’ transformation that maps points to lines and vice\r
versa while preserving this incidence relation. In particular, since the space of all points lying on\r
any given line is a copy of OP1, so is the space of all lines containing a given point!\r
To dig more deeply into the geometry of OP2one needs another important structure on the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra: the determinant. We saw in Section 3.3 that despite noncommutativity\r
and nonassociativity, the determinant of a matrix in h2(O) is a well-defined and useful concept. The\r
same holds for h3(O)! We can define the determinant of a matrix in h3(O) by\r
det\r
\r
\r
α z∗ y\r
∗\r
z β x\r
y x∗ γ\r
\r
 = αβγ − (αkxk\r
2 + βkyk2 + γkzk2\r
) + 2Re(xyz).\r
We can express this in terms of the trace and product via\r

This shows that the determinant is invariant under all automorphisms of h3(O). However, the\r
determinant is invariant under an even bigger group of linear transformations. As we shall see in\r
Section 4.4, this group is 78-dimensional: it is a noncompact real form of the exceptional Lie group\r
E6. This extra symmetry makes it worth seeing how much geometry we can do starting with just\r
the determinant and the vector space structure of h3(O).\r
The determinant is a cubic form on h3(O), so there is a unique symmetric trilinear form\r
(·, ·, ·): h3(O) × h3(O) × h3(O) → R\r
such that\r
(a, a, a) = det(a).\r
By dualizing this, we obtain the so-called cross product\r
×: h3(O) × h3(O) → h3(O)\r
∗\r
.\r
Explicitly, this is given by\r
(a × b)(c) = (a, b, c).\r
Despite its name, this product is commutative.\r
We have already seen that points of OP2correspond to trace-1 projections in h3(O). Freudenthal\r
[40] noticed that these are the same as elements p ∈ h3(O) with tr(p) = 1 and p × p = 0. Even\r
better, we can drop the equation tr(p) = 1 as long as we promise to work with equivalence classes of\r
nonzero elements satisfying p×p = 0, where two such elements are equivalent when one is a nonzero\r
real multiple of the other. Each such equivalence class [p] corresponds to a unique point of OP2, and\r
we get all the points this way.\r
Given two points [p] and [q], their cross product p×q is well-defined up to a nonzero real multiple.\r
This suggests that we define a ‘line’ to be an equivalence class of elements p×q ∈ h3(O)\r
∗\r
, where again\r
two such elements are deemed equivalent if one is a nonzero real multiple of the other. Freudenthal\r
showed that we get a projective plane isomorphic to OP2if we take these as our definitions of points\r
and lines and decree that the point [p] lies on the line [L] if and only if L(p) = 0. Note that this\r
equation makes sense even though L and p are only well-defined up to nonzero real multiples.\r
One consequence of all this is that one can recover the structure of OP2as a projective plane\r
starting from just the determinant on h3(O): we did not need the Jordan algebra structure! However,\r
to get a ‘duality’ map switching points and lines while preserving the incidence relation, we need a\r
bit more: we need the nondegenerate pairing\r
ha, bi = tr(ab)\r
on h3(O). This sets up an isomorphism\r
h3(O) ∼= h3(O)\r
∗\r
.\r
This isomorphism turns out to map points to lines, and in fact, it sets up a one-to-one correspondence\r
between points and lines. We can use this correspondence to think of both points and lines in\r
OP2as equivalence classes of elements of h3(O). In these terms, the point p lies on the line ℓ iff\r
hℓ, pi = 0. This relationship is symmetrical! It follows that if we switch points and lines using this\r
correspondence, the incidence relation is preserved.\r
We thus obtain a very pretty setup for working with OP2. If we use the isomorphism between\r
h3(O) and its dual to reinterpret the cross product as a map\r
×: h3(O) × h3(O) → h3(O),\r
then not only is the line through distinct points [p] and [q] given by [p × q], but also the point in\r
which two distinct lines [ℓ] and [m] meet is given by [ℓ × m]. A triple of points [p], [q] and [r] is\r
33

collinear iff (p, q, r) = 0, and a triple of lines [ℓ], [m], [n] meets at a point iff (ℓ, m, n) = 0. In\r
addition, there is a delightful bunch of identities relating the Jordan product, the determinant, the\r
cross product and the inner product in h3(O).\r
For more on octonionic geometry, the reader is urged to consult the original papers by Freudenthal\r
[39, 40, 41, 42], Jacques Tits [94, 95] and Tonny Springer [87, 88, 89]. The book by Helmut Salzmann\r
et al is also good [82]. Unfortunately, we must now bid goodbye to this subject and begin our trip\r
through the exceptional groups. However, we shall return to study the symmetries of OP2and the\r
exceptional Jordan algebra in Sections 4.2 and 4.4."""

On October 18th, 1887, Wilhelm Killing wrote a letter to Friedrich Engel saying that he had classified\r
the simple Lie algebras. In the next three years, this revolutionary work was published in a series of\r
papers [63]. Besides what we now call the ‘classical’ simple Lie algebras, he claimed to have found\r
6 ‘exceptional’ ones — new mathematical objects whose existence had never before been suspected.\r
In fact he gave a rigorous construction of only the smallest of these. In his 1894 thesis, Cartan [14]\r
constructed all of them and noticed that the two 52-dimensional exceptional Lie algebras discovered\r
by Killing were isomorphic, so that there are really only 5.\r
The Killing-Cartan classification of simple Lie algebras introduced much of the technology that\r
is now covered in any introductory course on the subject, such as roots and weights. In what follows\r
we shall avoid this technology, since we wish instead to see the exceptional Lie algebras as octonionic\r
relatives of the classical ones — slightly eccentric relatives, but still having a close connection to\r
geometry, in particular the Riemannian geometry of projective planes. It is also for this reason that\r
we shall focus on the compact real forms of the simple Lie algebras.\r
The classical simple Lie algebras can be organized in three infinite families:\r
so(n) = {x ∈ R[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},\r
su(n) = {x ∈ C[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0},\r
sp(n) = {x ∈ H[n]: x\r
∗ = −x}.\r
The corresponding Lie groups are\r
SO(n) = {x ∈ R[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},\r
SU(n) = {x ∈ C[n]: xx∗ = 1, det(x) = 1},\r
Sp(n) = {x ∈ H[n]: xx∗ = 1}.\r
These arise naturally as symmetry groups of projective spaces over R, C, and H, respectively. More\r
precisely, they arise as groups of isometries: transformations that preserve a specified Riemannian\r
metric. Let us sketch how this works, as a warmup for the exceptional groups.\r
First consider the projective space RPn. We can think of this as the unit sphere in R\r
n+1 with\r
antipodal points x and −x identified. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric from the sphere, and\r
the obvious action of the rotation group O(n + 1) as isometries of the sphere yields an action of this\r
group as isometries of RPn with this metric. In fact, with this metric, the group of all isometries of\r
RPnis just\r
Isom(RPn) ∼= O(n + 1)/O(1)\r
where O(1) = {±1} is the subgroup of O(n + 1) that acts trivially on RPn. The Lie algebra of this\r
isometry group is\r
isom(RPn) ∼= so(n + 1).\r
The case of CPnis very similar. We can think of this as the unit sphere in C\r
n+1 with points\r
x and αx identified whenever α is a unit complex number. It thus inherits a Riemannian metric\r
34

from this sphere, and the unitary group U(n + 1) acts as isometries. If we consider only the con\u0002nected component of the isometry group and ignore the orientation-reversing isometries coming from\r
complex conjugation, we have\r
Isom0(CPn) ∼= U(n + 1)/U(1)\r
where U(1) is the subgroup that acts trivially on CPn. The Lie algebra of this isometry group is\r
isom(CPn) ∼= su(n + 1).\r
The case of HPnis subtler, since we must take the noncommutativity of the quaternions into\r
account. We can think of HPnas the unit sphere in Hn+1 with points x and αx identified whenever\r
α is a unit quaternion, and as before, HPninherits a Riemannian metric. The group Sp(n + 1) acts\r
as isometries of HPn, but this action comes from right multiplication, so\r
Isom(HPn) ∼= Sp(n + 1)/{±1},\r
since not Sp(1) but only its center {±1} acts trivially on HPnby right multiplication. At the Lie\r
algebra level, this gives\r
isom(HPn) ∼= sp(n + 1).\r
For lovers of the octonions, it is tempting to try a similar construction starting with OP2. While\r
nonassociativity makes things a bit tricky, we show in Section 4.2 that it can in fact be done. It\r
turns out that Isom(OP2) is one of the exceptional Lie groups, namely F4. Similarly, the exceptional\r
Lie groups E6, E7 and E8 are in a certain subtle sense the isometry groups of projective planes over\r
the algebras C ⊗ O, H ⊗ O and O ⊗ O. Together with F4, these groups can all be defined by the\r
so-called ‘magic square’ construction, which makes use of much of the algebra we have described so\r
far. We explain three versions of this construction in Section 4.3. We then treat the groups E6,E7\r
and E8 individually in the following sections. But first, we must introduce G2: the smallest of the\r
exceptional Lie groups, and none other than the automorphism group of the octonions."""

In 1914, Elie Cartan noted that the smallest of the exceptional Lie gr ´ oups, G2, is the automorphism\r
group of the octonions [15]. Its Lie algebra g2 is therefore der(O), the derivations of the octonions.\r
Let us take these facts as definitions of G2 and its Lie algebra, and work out some of the consequences.\r
What are automorphisms of the octonions like? One way to analyze this involves subalgebras of\r
the octonions. Any octonion e1 whose square is −1 generates a subalgebra of O isomorphic to C.\r
If we then pick any octonion e2 with square equal to −1 that anticommutes with e1, the elements\r
e1, e2 generate a subalgebra isomorphic to H. Finally, if we pick any octonion e3 with square equal\r
to −1 that anticommutes with e1, e2, and e1e2, the elements e1, e2, e3 generate all of O. We call\r
such a triple of octonions a basic triple. Given any basic triple, there exists a unique way to define\r
e4, . . ., e7 so that the whole multiplication table in Section 2 holds. In fact, this follows from the\r
remarks on the Cayley–Dickson construction at the end of Section 2.3.\r
It follows that given any two basic triples, there exists a unique automorphism of O mapping\r
the first to the second. Conversely, it is obvious that any automorphism maps basic triples to basic\r
triples. This gives a nice description of the group G2, as follows.\r
Fix a basic triple e1, e2, e3. There is a unique automorphism of the octonions mapping this to\r

This picture becomes a bit more vivid if we remember that after choosing unit vectors in V8\r
and S\r
+\r
8\r
, we can identify both these representations with the octonions, with both unit vectors\r
corresponding to 1 ∈ O. Thus what we are really saying is this: the subgroup of Spin(8) that fixes\r
1 in the vector representation on O is Spin(7); the subgroup that fixes 1 in both the vector and\r
right-handed spinor representations is G2. This subgroup also fixes the element 1 in the left-handed\r
spinor representation of Spin(8) on O.\r
Now, using the vector representation of Spin(8) on O, we get homomorphisms\r
G2 ֒→ Spin(8) → SO(O)\r
where SO(O) ∼= SO(8) is the rotation group of the octonions, viewed as a real vector space with\r
the inner product hx, yi = Re(x\r
∗y). The map from Spin(8) to SO(O) is two-to-one, but when we\r
restrict it to G2 we get a one-to-one map\r
G2 ֒→ SO(O).\r
At the Lie algebra level, this construction gives an inclusion\r
g2 ֒→ so(O)\r
where so(O) ∼= so(8) is the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the octonions.\r
Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(O) is 28-dimensional, it is nice to see exactly where the extra\r
14 dimensions come from. In fact, they come from two copies of Im(O), the 7-dimensional space\r
consisting of all imaginary octonions.\r
More precisely, we have:\r
so(O) = g2 ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O) (11)\r
(a direct sum of vector spaces, not Lie algebras), where LIm(O)is the space of linear transformations\r
of O given by left multiplication by imaginary octonions and RIm(O)\r
is the space of linear transfor\u0002mations of O given by right multiplication by imaginary octonions [84]. To see this, we first check\r
that left multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. Using polarization, it suffices to\r
note that\r
hx, axi = Re(x\r
∗\r
(ax)) = Re((x\r
∗\r
a)x) = Re((a\r
∗x)∗x) = −Re((ax)∗x) = −hax, xi\r
for all a ∈ Im(O) and x ∈ O. Note that this calculation only uses the alternative law, not the\r
associative law, since x, x∗ and a all lie in the algebra generated by the two elements a and Im(x).\r
36

A similar argument shows that right multiplication by an imaginary octonion is skew-adjoint. It\r
follows that g2, LIm(O) and RIm(O) all naturally lie in so(8). Next, with some easy calculations we\r
can check that\r
LIm(O) ∩ RIm(O) = {0}\r
and\r
g2 ∩ (LIm(O) + RIm(O)) = {0}.\r
Using the fact that the dimensions of the 3 pieces adds to 28, equation (11) follows.\r
We have seen that G2 sits inside SO(8), but we can do better: it actually sits inside SO(7). After\r
all, every automorphism of the octonions fixes the identity, and thus preserves the space of octonions\r
orthogonal to the identity. This space is just Im(O), so we have an inclusion\r
G2 ֒→ SO(Im(O))\r
where SO(Im(O)) ∼= SO(7) is the rotation group of the imaginary octonions. At the Lie algebra\r
level this gives an inclusion\r
g2 ֒→ so(Im(O)).\r
Since g2 is 14-dimensional and so(Im(O)) is 21-dimensional, it is nice to see where the 7 extra\r
dimensions come from. Examining equation (11), it is clear that these extra dimensions must come\r
from the transformations in LIm(O) ⊕RIm(O) that annihilate the identity 1 ∈ O. The transformations\r
that do this are precisely those of the form\r
ada = La − Ra\r
for a ∈ Im(O). We thus have\r
so(Im(O)) ∼= der(O) ⊕ adIm(O) (12)\r
where adIm(O)is the 7-dimensional space of such transformations.\r
We may summarize some of the above results as follows:\r
Theorem 4. The compact real form of the Lie algebra g2 is given by\r
g2 = der(O) ⊂ so(Im(O)) ⊂ so(O)\r
and we have\r
so(Im(O)) = der(O) ⊕ adIm(O)\r
so(O) = der(O) ⊕ LIm(O) ⊕ RIm(O)\r
where the Lie brackets in so(Im(O)) and so(O) are built from natural bilinear operations on the\r
summands.\r
As we have seen, G2 has a 7-dimensional representation Im(O). In fact, this is the smallest\r
nontrivial representation of G2, so it is worth understanding in as many ways as possible. The\r
space Im(O) has at least three natural structures that are preserved by the transformations in G2.\r
These give more descriptions of G2 as a symmetry group, and they also shed some new light on the\r
octonions. The first two of the structures we describe are analogous to more familiar ones that exist\r
on the 3-dimensional space of imaginary quaternions, Im(H). The third makes explicit use of the\r
nonassociativity of the octonions.\r
First, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the commutator. In the case of Im(H), the\r
commutator divided by 2 is the familiar cross product in 3 dimensions:\r
a × b =\r
1\r
2\r
[a, b].\r
37

We can make the same definition for Im(O), obtaining a 7-dimensional analog of the cross product.\r
For both Im(H) and Im(O) the cross product is bilinear and anticommutative. The cross product\r
makes Im(H) into a Lie algebra, but not Im(O). For both Im(H) and Im(O), the cross product has\r
two nice geometrical properties. On the one hand, its norm is determined by the formula\r
ka × bk\r
2 + ha, bi2 = kak2\r
kbk\r
2\r
,\r
or equivalently,\r
ka × bk = |sin θ| kak kbk,\r
where θ is the angle between a and b. On the other hand, a × b is orthogonal to a and b. Both these\r
properties follow from easy calculations. For Im(H), these two properties are enough to determine\r
x × y up to a sign. For Im(O) they are not — but they become so if we also use the fact that x × y\r
lies inside a copy of Im(H) that contains x and y.\r
It is clear that the group of all real-linear transformations of Im(H) preserving the cross product\r
is just SO(3), which is also the automorphism group of the quaternions. One can similarly show\r
that the group of real-linear transformations of Im(O) preserving the cross product is exactly G2.\r
To see this, start by noting that any element of G2 preserves the cross product on Im(O), since the\r
cross product is defined using octonion multiplication. To show that conversely any transformation\r
preserving the cross product lies in G2, it suffices to express the multiplication of imaginary octonions\r
in terms of their cross product. Using this identity:\r
a × b = ab + ha, bi,\r
it actually suffices to express the inner product on Im(O) in terms of the cross product. Here the\r
following identity does the job:\r
ha, bi = −1\r
6\r
tr(a × (b × ·)) (13)\r
where the right-hand side refers to the trace of the map\r
a × (b × ·): Im(O) → Im(O).\r
Second, both Im(H) and Im(O) are equipped with a natural 3-form, or in other words, an\r
alternating trilinear functional. This is given by\r
φ(x, y, z) = hx, yzi.\r
In the case of Im(H) this is just the usual volume form, and the group of real-linear transformations\r
preserving it is SL(3, R). In the case of Im(O), the real-linear transformations preserving φ are\r
exactly those in the group G2. A proof of this by Robert Bryant can be found in Reese Harvey’s\r
book [54]. The 3-form φ is important in the theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’ [60], which are 7-dimensional\r
Riemannian manifolds with holonomy group equal to G2.\r
Third, both Im(H) and Im(O) are closed under the associator. For Im(H) this is boring, since\r
the associator vanishes. On the other hand, for Im(O) the associator is interesting. In fact, it\r
follows from results of Harvey [54] that a real-linear transformation T : Im(O) → Im(O) preserves\r
the associator if and only if ±T lies in G2. Thus the symmetry group of the associator is slightly\r
bigger than G2: it is G2 × Z2.\r
Now we must make an embarrassing admission: these three structures on Im(O) are all almost\r
the same thing! Starting with the cross product\r
×: Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O)\r
we can recover the usual inner product on Im(O) by equation (13). This inner product allows us\r
to dualize the cross product and obtain a trilinear functional, which is, up to a constant, just the\r
3-form\r
φ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.\r
38

The cross product also determines an orientation on Im(O) (we leave this as an exercise for the\r
reader). This allows us to take the Hodge dual of φ, obtaining a 4-form ψ, i.e. an alternating\r
tetralinear functional\r
ψ: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → R.\r
Dualizing yet again, this gives a ternary operation which, up to a constant multiple, is the associator:\r
[·, ·, ·]: Im(O) × Im(O) × Im(O) → Im(O).\r
We conclude this section with a handy explicit formula for all the derivations of the octonions.\r
In an associative algebra A, any element x defines an inner derivation adx: A → A by\r
adx(a) = [x, a]\r
where the bracket denotes the commutator xa−ax. In a nonassociative algebra, this formula usually\r
does not define a derivation. However, if A is alternative, any pair of elements x, y ∈ A define a\r
derivation Dx,y: A → A by\r
Dx,ya = [[x, y], a] − 3[x, y, a] (14)\r
where [a, b, x] denotes the associator (ab)x − a(bx). Moreover, when A is a normed division algebra,\r
every derivation is a linear combination of derivations of this form. Unfortunately, proving these\r
facts seems to require some brutal calculations [84]."""

The second smallest of the exceptional Lie groups is the 52-dimensional group F4. The geometric\r
meaning of this group became clear in a number of nearly simultaneous papers by various mathe\u0002maticians. In 1949, Jordan constructed the octonionic projective plane using projections in h3(O).\r
One year later, Armand Borel [10] noted that F4 is the isometry group of a 16-dimensional projec\u0002tive plane. In fact, this plane is none other than than OP2\r
. Also in 1950, Claude Chevalley and\r
Richard Schafer [21] showed that F4 is the automorphism group of h3(O). In 1951, Freudenthal\r
[39] embarked upon a long series of papers in which he described not only F4 but also the other\r
exceptional Lie groups using octonionic projective geometry. To survey these developments, one still\r
cannot do better than to read his classic 1964 paper on Lie groups and the foundations of geometry\r
[42].\r
Let us take Chevalley and Schafer’s result as the definition of F4:\r
F4 = Aut(h3(O)).\r
Its Lie algebra is thus\r
f4 = der(h3(O)).\r

Riemannian metric for which F4 is the isometry group. To get a sense of how this works, let us\r
describe OP2as a quotient space of F4.\r

. We have already seen\r

This fact has various nice spinoffs. First, it gives an easy way to compute the dimension of F4:\r
dim(F4) = dim(Spin(9)) + dim(OP2) = 36 + 16 = 52.\r
Second, since F4 is compact, we can take any Riemannian metric on OP2and average it with respect\r
to the action of this group. The isometry group of the resulting metric will automatically include\r
F4 as a subgroup. With more work [6], one can show that actually\r
F4 = Isom(OP2)\r

f4 = isom(OP2).\r
Equation (15) also implies that the tangent space of our chosen point in OP2is isomorphic to\r

This formula emphasizes the close relation between f4 and triality: the Lie bracket in f4 is completely\r
built out of maps involving so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible representations! We can\r
rewrite this in a way that brings out the role of the octonions:\r
f4\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ O\r
3\r
While elegant, none of these descriptions of f4 gives a convenient picture of all the derivations\r
of the exceptional Jordan algebra. In fact, there is a nice picture of this sort for h3(K) whenever K\r
is a normed division algebra. One way to get a derivation of the Jordan algebra h3(K) is to take a\r
derivation of K and let it act on each entry of the matrices in h3(K). Another way uses elements of\r
sa3(K) = {x ∈ K[3]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.\r
Given x ∈ sa3(K), there is a derivation adx of h3(K) given by\r
adx(a) = [x, a].\r
40

In fact [5], every derivation of h3(K) can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of derivations\r
of these two sorts, so we have\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K) (19)\r
as vector spaces. In the case of the octonions, this decomposition says that\r
f4\r
∼= g2 ⊕ sa3(O).\r
In equation (19), the subspace der(K) is always a Lie subalgebra, but sa3(K) is not unless K is\r
commutative and associative — in which case der(K) vanishes. Nonetheless, there is a formula for\r
the brackets in der(h3(K)) which applies in every case [75]. Given D, D′ ∈ der(K) and x, y ∈ sa3(K),\r
we have\r
[D, D′] = DD′ − D′D\r

where D acts on x componentwise, [x, y]0 is the trace-free part of the commutator [x, y], and Dxij,yij\r

Around 1956, Boris Rosenfeld [79] had the remarkable idea that just as F4 is the isometry group of\r
the projective plane over the octonions, the exceptional Lie groups E6, E7 and E8 are the isometry\r
groups of projective planes over the following three algebras, respectively:\r
• the bioctonions, C ⊗ O,\r
• the quateroctonions, H ⊗ O,\r
• the octooctonions, O ⊗ O.\r
There is definitely something right about this idea, because one would expect these projective planes\r
to have dimensions 32, 64, and 128, and there indeed do exist compact Riemannian manifolds with\r
these dimensions having E6, E7 and E8 as their isometry groups. The problem is that the bioctonions,\r
quateroctonions and and octooctonions are not division algebras, so it is a nontrivial matter to define\r
projective planes over them!\r
The situation is not so bad for the bioctonions: h3(C⊗O) is a simple Jordan algebra, though not\r
a formally real one, and one can use this to define (C ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
in a manner modeled after one of the\r
constructions of OP2. Rosenfeld claimed that a similar construction worked for the quateroctonions\r
and octooctonions, but this appears to be false. Among other problems, h3(H ⊗ O) and h3(O ⊗ O)\r
do not become Jordan algebras under the product a ◦ b = 1\r
2\r
(ab + ba). Scattered throughout the\r
41

literature [6, 42, 43] one can find frustrated comments about the lack of a really nice construction\r
of (H ⊗ O)P\r
2 and (O ⊗ O)P2\r
. One problem is that these spaces do not satisfy the usual axioms\r
for a projective plane. Tits addressed this problem in his theory of ‘buildings’, which allows one\r
to construct a geometry having any desired algebraic group as symmetries [97]. But alas, it still\r
seems that the quickest way to get our hands on the quateroctonionic and octooctonionic ‘projective\r
planes’ is by starting with the Lie groups E7 and E8 and then taking quotients by suitable subgroups.\r
In short, more work must be done before we can claim to fully understand the geometrical\r
meaning of the Lie groups E6,E7 and E8. Luckily, Rosenfeld’s ideas can be used to motivate a\r
nice construction of their Lie algebras. This goes by the name of the ‘magic square’. Tits [96] and\r
Freudenthal [41] found two very different versions of this construction in about 1958, but we shall\r
start by presenting a simplified version published by E. B. Vinberg [99] in 1966.\r
First consider the projective plane KP2 when K is a normed division algebra K. The points of this\r
plane are the rank-1 projections in the Jordan algebra h3(K), and this plane admits a Riemannian\r
metric such that\r
isom(KP2) ∼= der(h3(K)).\r
Moreover, we have seen in equation (19) that\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K).\r
Combined with Rosenfeld’s observations, these facts might lead one to hope that whenever we have\r
a pair of normed division algebras K and K′, there is a Riemannian manifold (K ⊗ K′)P\r
2 with\r
isom((K ⊗ K\r
′\r
)P\r
2\r
) ∼= der(K) ⊕ der(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
)\r
where for any ∗-algebra A we define\r
shn(A) = {x ∈ A[n]: x\r
∗ = x, tr(x) = 0}\r
san(A) = {x ∈ A[n]: x\r
∗ = −x, tr(x) = 0}.\r
This motivated Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras:\r
M(K, K\r
′\r
) = der(K) ⊕ der(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
).\r
Now, when K⊗K′is commutative and associative, sa3(K⊗K′) is a Lie algebra with the commutator\r
as its Lie bracket, but in the really interesting cases it is not. Thus to make M(K, K′) into a Lie\r
algebra we must give it a rather subtle bracket. We have already seen the special case K′ = R in\r
equation (20). In general, the Lie bracket in M(K, K′) is given as follows:\r
1. der(K) and der(K′) are commuting Lie subalgebras of M(K, K′).\r
2. The bracket of D ∈ der(K) ⊕ der(K′) with x ∈ sa3(K ⊗ K′) is given by applying D to every\r
entry of the matrix x, using the natural action of der(K) ⊕ der(K′) as derivations of K ⊗ K′."""

Table 5 — Magic Square Lie Algebras M(K, K′)\r
We will mainly be interested in the last row (or column), which is the one involving the octonions.\r
In this case we can take the magic square construction as defining the Lie algebras f4, e6, e7 and e8.\r
This definition turns out to be consistent with our earlier definition of f4.\r
Starting from Vinberg’s definition of the magic square Lie algebras, we can easily recover Tits’\r
original definition. To do so, we need two facts. First,\r
sa3(K ⊗ K\r
′\r
) ∼= sa3(K\r
′\r
) ⊕ (Im(K)⊗sh3(K\r
′\r
)).\r
This is easily seen by direct examination of the relevant matrices. Second,\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= der(K) ⊕ sa3(K)\r
as vector spaces. This is just equation (19). Starting with Vinberg’s definition and applying these\r
two facts, we obtain\r
M(K, K′) = der(K) ⊕ der(K′) ⊕ sa3(K ⊗ K′)\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ der(K′\r
) ⊕ sa3(K′) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′))\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ der(h3(K′\r
)) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′)).\r
The last line is Tits’ definition of the magic square Lie algebras. Unlike Vinberg’s, it is not manifestly\r
symmetrical in K and K′. This unhappy feature is somewhat made up for by the fact that der(K) ⊕\r
der(h3(K′)) is a nice big Lie subalgebra. This subalgebra acts on Im(K)⊗sh3(K′) in an obvious way,\r
using the fact that any derivation of K maps Im(K) to itself, and any derivation of h3(K′) maps\r
sh3(K′) to itself. However, the bracket of two elements of (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′)) is a bit of a mess.\r
Yet another description of the magic square was recently given by Barton and Sudbery [5]. This\r
one emphasizes the role of trialities. Let tri(K) be the Lie algebra of the group Aut(t), where t is\r
the normed triality giving the normed division algebra K. From equation (5) we have\r
tri(R) ∼= {0}\r
tri(C) ∼= u(1)2\r
tri(H) ∼= sp(1)3\r
tri(O) ∼= so(8).\r
(21)\r
To express the magic square in terms of these Lie algebras, we need three facts. First, it is easy to\r
see that\r
sh3(K) ∼= K\r
3 ⊕ R2\r
.\r
Second, Barton and Sudbery show that as vector spaces,\r
der(h3(K)) ∼= tri(K) ⊕ K\r
3\r
.\r
43

This follows in a case–by–case way from equation (21), but they give a unified proof that covers all\r
cases. Third, they show that as vector spaces,\r
tri(K) ∼= der(K) ⊕ Im(K)\r
2\r
.\r
Now starting with Tits’ definition of the magic square, applying the first two facts, regrouping terms,\r
and applying the third fact, we obtain Barton and Sudbery’s version of the magic square:\r
M(K, K′) ∼= der(K) ⊕ der(h3(K′\r
)) ⊕ (Im(K) ⊗ sh3(K′))\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ K′3 ⊕ Im(K)⊗(K′3 ⊕ R\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(K) ⊕ Im(K)\r
2 ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′)\r
3\r
∼= tri(K) ⊕ tri(K′\r
) ⊕ (K ⊗ K′)\r
3\r
.\r
In the next three sections we use all these different versions of the magic square to give lots of\r
octonionic descriptions of e6, e7 and e8. To save space, we usually omit the formulas for the Lie\r
bracket in these descriptions. However, the patient reader can reconstruct these with the help of\r
Barton and Sudbery’s paper, which is packed with useful formulas.\r
As we continue our tour through the exceptional Lie algebras, we shall make contact with Adams’\r
work [2] constructing f4, e6, e7, and e8 with the help of spinors and rotation group Lie algebras:\r
f4\r
∼= so(9) ⊕ S9\r

as vector spaces. Note that the numbers 9, 10, 12 and 16 are 8 more than the dimensions of R, C, H\r
and O. As usual, this is no coincidence! In terms of the octonions, Bott periodicity implies that\r

In fact, he describes the bracket in e6 in terms of natural operations involving so(10) and its spinor\r

S10, defined using the obvious action of u(1) on this complex vector space.\r
If we define E6 to be the simply connected group with Lie algebra e6, it follows from results of\r
Adams that the subgroup generated by the Lie subalgebra so(10)⊕u(1) is isomorphic to (Spin(10)×\r

where in each case the Lie bracket of e6 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands.\r
The smallest nontrivial representations of E6 are 27-dimensional: in fact it has two inequivalent\r
representations of this dimension, which are dual to one another. Now, the exceptional Jordan\r
algebra is also 27-dimensional, and in 1950 this clue led Chevalley and Schafer [21] to give a nice\r
description of E6 as symmetries of this algebra. These symmetries do not preserve the product, but\r
only the determinant.\r
More precisely, the group of determinant-preserving linear transformations of h3(O) turns out to\r
be a noncompact real form of E6. This real form is sometimes called E6(−26), because its Killing form\r
has signature −26. To see this, note that any automorphism of h3(O) preserves the determinant, so\r
we get an inclusion\r
F4 ֒→ E6(−26).\r
This means that F4 is a compact subgroup of E6(−26). In fact it is a maximal compact subgroup, since\r
if there were a larger one, we could average a Riemannian metric group on OP2 with respect to this\r
group and get a metric with an isometry group larger than F4, but no such metric exists. It follows\r
that the Killing form on the Lie algebra e6(−26) is negative definite on its 52-dimensional maximal\r
compact Lie algebra, f4, and positive definite on the complementary 26-dimensional subspace, giving\r
a signature of 26 − 52 = −26.\r
We saw in Section 3.4 that the projective plane structure of OP2can be constructed starting\r
only with the determinant function on the vector space h3(O). It follows that E6(−26) acts as\r
collineations on OP2, that is, line-preserving transformations. In fact, the group of collineations\r
of OP2is precisely E6(−26):\r
E6(−26) ∼= Coll(OP2).\r
Moreover, just as the group of isometries of OP2fixing a specific point is a copy of Spin(9), the\r
group of collineations fixing a specific point is Spin(9, 1). This fact follows with some work starting\r
from equation (8), and it gives us a commutative square of inclusions:\r
Spin(9) −→ Isom(OP2) ∼= F4\r
↓ ↓\r
Spin(9, 1) −→ Coll(OP2) ∼= E6(−26)\r
where the groups on the top are maximal compact subgroups of those on the bottom. Thus in a\r

[13, 36, 72]. The geometrical significance of this rather complicated sort of structure has recently\r
been clarified by some physicists working on string theory. At the end of the previous section, we\r
mentioned a relation between 9-dimensional Euclidean geometry and F4, and a corresponding rela\u0002tion between 10-dimensional Lorentzian geometry and E6(−26). Murat G¨unaydin [48] has extended\r
this to a relation between 10-dimensional conformal geometry and E7(−25), and in work with Kil\u0002ian Koepsell and Hermann Nikolai [49] has explicated how this is connected to Freudenthal triple\r
systems."""

With 248 dimensions, E8 is the biggest of the exceptional Lie groups, and in some ways the most\r
mysterious. The easiest way to understand a group is to realize it as as symmetries of a structure\r
one already understands. Of all the simple Lie groups, E8 is the only one whose smallest nontrivial\r
representation is the adjoint representation. This means that in the context of linear algebra, E8 is\r
most simply described as the group of symmetries of its own Lie algebra! One way out of this vicious\r
circle would be to describe E8 as isometries of a Riemannian manifold. As already mentioned, E8\r
is the isometry group of a 128-dimensional manifold called (O ⊗ O)P"""

e8\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(O)).\r
The Barton-Sudbery construction gives\r
e8\r
∼= tri(O) ⊕ tri(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
(24)\r
We can use any of these to count the dimension of e8; for example, the last one gives\r
dim e8 = 28 + 28 + 3 · 8\r
2 = 248.\r
To emphasize the importance of triality, we can rewrite equation (24) as:\r
e8\r
∼= so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8) ⊕ (S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
) ⊕ (S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
). (25)\r
Here the Lie bracket is built from natural maps relating so(8) and its three 8-dimensional irreducible\r
representations. In particular, so(8) ⊕ so(8) is a Lie subalgebra, and the first copy of so(8) acts on\r
the first factor in V8 ⊗ V8, S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
, and S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
, while the second copy acts on the second factor\r
in each of these. The reader should compare this to the description of f4 in equation (18).\r
Now, equation (17) implies that\r
so(16) ∼= so(8) ⊕ so(8) ⊕ (V8 ⊗ V8).\r
Together with equation (25), this suggests that e8 contains so(16) as a Lie subalgebra. In fact this\r
is true! Even better, if we restrict the right-handed spinor representation of so(16) to so(8) ⊕ so(8),\r
it decomposes as\r
S\r
+\r
16\r
∼= (S\r
+\r
8 ⊗ S\r
+\r
8\r
) ⊕ (S\r
−\r
8 ⊗ S\r
−\r
8\r
),\r
so we obtain\r
e8\r
∼= so(16) ⊕ S\r
+\r
16 (26)\r
or in more octonionic language,\r
e8\r
∼= so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
where we use so(V ) to mean the Lie algebra of skew-adjoint real-linear transformations of the real\r
inner product space V .\r
The really remarkable thing about equation (26) is that the Lie bracket in e8 is entirely built\r
from natural maps involving so(16) and S\r
+\r
16:\r
so(16) ⊗ so(16) → so(16), so(16) ⊗ S\r
+\r
16 → S\r
+\r
16, S+\r
16 ⊗ S\r
+\r
16 → so(16).\r
The first of these is the Lie bracket in so(16), the second is the action of so(16) on its right-handed\r
spinor representation, and the third is obtained from the second by duality, using the natural inner\r
product on so(16) and S\r
+\r
16 to identify these spaces with their duals. In fact, this is a very efficient\r
way to define e8. If we take this approach, we must verify the Jacobi identity:\r
[[a, b], c] = [a, [b, c]] − [b, [a, c]].\r
When all three of a, b, c lie in so(16) this is just the Jacobi identity for so(16). When two of them\r
lie in so(16), it boils down to fact that spinors indeed form a representation of so(16). Thanks to\r
duality, the same is true when just one lies in so(16). It thus suffices to consider the case when a, b, c\r
all lie in S\r
+\r
16. This is the only case that uses anything special about the number 16. Unfortunately,\r
at this point a brute-force calculation seems to be required. For two approaches that minimize the\r
49

pain, see the books by Adams [2] and by Green, Schwarz and Witten [46]. It would be nice to find\r
a more conceptual approach.\r
Starting from e8, we can define E8 to be the simply-connected Lie group with this Lie algebra. As\r
shown by Adams [2], the subgroup of E8 generated by the Lie subalgebra so(16) ⊂ e8 is Spin(16)/Z2.\r
This lets us define the octooctonionic projective plane by\r
(O ⊗ O)P\r
2 = E8 / (Spin(16)/Z2).\r
By equation (26), the tangent space at any point of this manifold is isomorphic to S\r
+\r
16\r
∼= (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
.\r
This partially justifies calling it ‘octooctonionic projective plane’, though it seems not to satisfy the\r
usual axioms for a projective plane.\r
We can put an E8-invariant Riemannian metric on the octooctonionic projective plane by the\r
technique of averaging over the group action. It then turns out [6] that\r
E8\r
∼= Isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
and thus\r
e8\r
∼= isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
).\r
Summarizing, we have the following octonionic descriptions of E8:\r
Theorem 8. The compact real form of e8 is given by\r
e8\r
∼= isom((O ⊗ O)P\r
2\r
)\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(h3(O)) ⊕ (Im(O)⊗sh3\r
(O))\r
∼= der(O) ⊕ der(O) ⊕ sa3(O ⊗ O)\r
∼= so(O ⊕ O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
2\r
∼= so(O) ⊕ so(O) ⊕ (O ⊗ O)\r
3\r
where in each case the Lie bracket on e8 is built from natural bilinear operations on the summands."""

It should be clear by now that besides being a fascinating mathematical object in their own right,\r
the octonions link together many important phenomena whose connections would otherwise be\r
completely mysterious. Indeed, the full story of these connections is deeper and more elaborate than\r
I have been able to explain here! It also includes:\r
• Attempts to set up an octonionic analogue of the theory of analytic functions (see [51] and the\r
references therein).\r
• The role of Jordan pairs, Jordan triple systems and Freudenthal triple systems in the construc\u0002tion of exceptional Lie groups [13, 36, 37, 49, 51, 71, 72].\r
• Constructions of the E8 lattice and Leech lattice using integral octonions [26, 33].\r
• Tensor-categorical approaches to normed division algebras and the invariant of framed trivalent\r
graphs coming from the quantum group associated to G2 [9, 12, 64, 81].\r
• Octonionic constructions of vertex operator algebras [38].\r
• Octonionic constructions of the exceptional simple Lie superalgebras [92].\r
• Octonionic constructions of symmetric spaces [6].\r
50

• Octonions and the geometry of the ‘squashed 7-spheres’, that is, the homogeneous spaces\r
Spin(7)/G2, Spin(6)/SU(3), and Spin(5)/SU(2), all of which are diffeomorphic to S\r
7 with its\r
usual smooth structure [22].\r
• The theory of ‘Joyce manifolds’, that is, 7-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with holonomy\r
group G2 [60].\r
• The octonionic Hopf map and instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations in 8 dimensions\r
[47].\r
• Octonionic aspects of 10-dimensional superstring theory and 10-dimensional super-Yang-Mills\r
theory [25, 29, 35, 65, 85, 86].\r
• Octonionic aspects of 11-dimensional supergravity and supermembrane theories, and the role\r
of Joyce manifolds in compactifying 11-dimensional supergravity to obtain theories of physics\r
in 4 dimensions [32].\r
• Geoffrey Dixon’s extension of the Standard Model based on the algebra C ⊗ H ⊗ O [31].\r
• Other attempts to use the octonions in physics [20, 51, 67, 76].\r
I urge the reader to explore these with the help of the references.\r
