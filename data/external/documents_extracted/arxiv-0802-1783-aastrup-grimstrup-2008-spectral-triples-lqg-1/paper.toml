Abstract\r
This paper establishes a link between Noncommutative Geometry\r
and canonical quantum gravity. A semi-finite spectral triple over a\r
space of connections is presented. The triple involves an algebra of\r
holonomy loops and a Dirac type operator which resembles a global\r
functional derivation operator. The interaction between the Dirac op\u0002erator and the algebra reproduces the Poisson structure of General\r
Relativity. Moreover, the associated Hilbert space corresponds, up to\r
a discrete symmetry group, to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism in\u0002variant states known from Loop Quantum Gravity. Correspondingly,\r
the square of the Dirac operator has, in terms of canonical quantum\r
gravity, the form of a global area-squared operator. Furthermore, the\r
spectral action resembles a partition function of Quantum Gravity.\r
The construction is background independent and is based on an in\u0002ductive system of triangulations. This paper is the first of two papers\r
on the subject.\r

1 Introduction\r
Ever since the discovery of the Standard Model of Particle Physics physicists\r
have worked to understand the apparently arbitrary structure of this the\u0002ory. Natures choice of gauge group, the Higgs sector, the 20-30 apparently\r
unrelated parameters etc. almost begs for a deeper explanation.\r
With the pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the Standard\r
Model [1]-[8] such an explanation now appears to emerge. In Connes’ work\r
the Standard Model coupled to General Relativity is expressed as a single\r
gravitational theory. The language used for this unification is Noncommu\u0002tative Geometry [1]. Within this framework, and under a few mathematical\r
assumptions, the Standard Model coupled to gravity can be shown to be\r
almost unique [7, 8].\r
Noncommutative Geometry is based on the result [1, 9] that Riemannian\r
spin geometry has an equivalent formulation in terms of commutative \u0006-\r
3

algebras and Dirac operators. In this formulation it is the Dirac operator that\r
carries metric information of the underlying manifold which is now written\r
as the spectrum of the \u0006-algebra. In total, a Riemannian spin geometry can\r
be described in terms of a spectral triple which is the collection pB, H, Dq of\r
the algebra B, the Dirac operator D and the Hilbert space H which carries\r
a representation and action of B and D. To obtain equivalence the triple is\r
required to satisfy a set of axioms of Noncommutative Geometry.\r
The language of spectral triples has a natural generalisation which in\u0002cludes also noncommutative \u0006-algebras and corresponding Dirac type opera\u0002tors. It is this generalisation which leads to the aforementioned formulation\r
of the Standard Model. It turns out that the classical action of the Standard\r
Model coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action emerges from a spectral action\r
principle applied to a specific spectral triple [3, 4, 5]. This triple involves\r
an almost commutative \u0006-algebra which is an algebra that factorises into a\r
commutative part times a matrix factor. This means that the classical action\r
describing all fundamental physics4emerges from an asymptotic expansion\r
of the spectral action\r
TrφpD˜ {λq \u0010\r
¸\r
λ\r
n\r
cn .\r
Here D˜ denotes the Dirac type operator D subjected to certain inner fluc\u0002tuations stemming from the noncommutativity of the algebra. Without the\r
matrix factor, that is, for a commutative \u0006-algebra, the same expression leads\r
to the Einstein-Hilbert action alone. Thus, it is the inclusion of noncommuta\u0002tive \u0006-algebras in the language of spectral triples that permits the formulation\r
of all fundamental forces and particles in terms of pure gravity.\r
This success of Noncommutative Geometry as a framework to describe\r
fundamental physics in a unified manner raises, however, a fundamental ques\u0002tion regarding quantization. The Standard Model by itself is a quantum\r
field theory. However, in its noncommutative formulation it arises as an\r
integrated part of a purely gravitational theory. This theory is essentially\r
classical. Quantum Field Theory enters the construction in a secondary step\r
where the spectral action has been expanded in a gravitational sector involv\u0002ing only the metric field and a matter sector including all the fermionic and\r
bosonic fields of the Standard Model. Quantization is applied to the latter\r
sector only.\r
So this is the question: how does the quantization procedure of Quantum\r
Field Theory fit into the language of Noncommutative Geometry? Since the\r
4Here we give the bosonic part only.\r
4

structure of the Standard Model is so readily translated into the language of\r
Noncommutative Geometry one would expect also Quantum Field Theory to\r
have a corresponding translation. This question is further complicated by the\r
intrinsic gravitational nature of Connes’ formulation of the Standard Model.\r
If a notion of quantization does exist within this framework one would expect\r
this to involve, at some level, Quantum Gravity.\r
This paper is motivated by these considerations. We wish to address the\r
question regarding the inclusion of the quantization procedure in the general\r
framework of Noncommutative Geometry and, in particular, in the noncom\u0002mutative formulation of the Standard Model. We start the investigation with\r
the assumption that the answer will involve some notion of Quantum Grav\u0002ity. Thus, to guide our intuition we consult first canonical quantum gravity\r
and one of its modern trends known as Loop Quantum Gravity [11]-[15].\r
Loop Quantum Gravity is an approach to non-perturbative Quantum\r
Gravity which is based on a formulation of General Relativity in terms of\r
Ashtekar variables [16, 17]. These variables include the Ashtekar connection\r
and its conjugate variable, the inverse densitised dreibein. In Loop Quantum\r
Gravity one takes as the classical phase space variables the holonomy loop\r
of the Ashtekar connection and its conjugate, a certain flux vector. These\r
variables are then used in a Dirac-type quantization procedure. This involves\r
the representation of the corresponding Poisson structure on a kinematical\r
Hilbert space as well as the formulation of constraints encoding the sym\u0002metries of the classical theory. Here, the holonomy loops are represented\r
as multiplication operators. This means that the kinematical Hilbert space\r
involves functions over a space of connections.\r
On a technical level, Loop Quantum Gravity exploits the holonomy\u0002formulation of gravity to recast the problem of quantizing gravity in terms\r
of a inductive system of graphs. It turns out that the space of connections,\r
when seen in terms of holonomies restricted to a specific graph, is a mani\u0002fold. This manifold is related to the gauge group which, in the case of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity, is SU p2q. This means that the space of connections itself\r
is a pro-manifold, the projective limit of manifolds. This, in turn, permits a\r
formulation of the quantization procedure on the level of finite graphs whose\r
complexity are subsequently increased infinitely. This construction is due to\r
Ashtekar and Lewandowski [18, 19].\r
In this paper we aim to construct a model which involves elements of\r
both Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Gravity. We use two central\r
elements of Loop Quantum Gravity to obtain such a model. First, the fact\r
5

that gravity can be formulated in terms of Wilson loops leads us to consider\r
a spectral triple which involves an algebra of holonomy loops. These loop\r
variables serve as functions on an underlying space of connections. Second,\r
we wish to exploit the pro-manifold structure of the space of connections to\r
describe the algebra of loops and to construct a Dirac type operator on the\r
space of connections. This means that we aim to construct a spectral triple\r
over each manifold associated to graphs in the projective system. These\r
spectral triples are required to be compatible with all embeddings between\r
graphs. This requirement will ensure that the limit where the complexity of\r
graphs is increased infinitely gives rise to a limit spectral triple.\r
This program was initiated first in [20] (see also [21]) where the authors\r
attempted to construct such a spectral triple. There the authors found that\r
the inductive system of graphs used in Loop Quantum Gravity, which is the\r
system of all piecewise analytic graphs, is too large to permit a Dirac type\r
operator on the space of connections. Technically, the multitude of possible\r
embedding of different graphs was found to be too large for a Dirac type\r
operator compatible with all embeddings to exist.\r
In the present paper we return to this problem to consider now different\r
systems of embedded graphs. In particular, we study the countable system of\r
embedded graphs given by a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions.\r
It turns out that this restricted system of graphs does permit a Dirac type\r
operator on the associated projective system of manifolds. Furthermore, we\r
find that the limit of infinitely many barycentric subdivisions gives us an\r
accurate description of the full space of connections as well as the associated\r
algebra of holonomy loops. The construction is general and only assumes the\r
gauge group G to be compact.\r
What we obtain is the following. Given a triangulation T and a compact\r
Lie group G, we construct a spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq , (1)\r
where B is the \u0006-algebra of holonomy loops obtained via the inductive system\r
of triangulations. The algebra is represented on the separable Hilbert space\r
H which carries an action of the Dirac type operator D. If we denote by A\r
the space of smooth connections in a trivial principal bundle M \u0002 G, where\r
M is a manifold which corresponds to the triangulation T , then we find\r
that A is densely contained in the pro-manifold associated to the algebra B.\r
This means that the spectral triple (1) is a geometrical construction over the\r
space of connections.\r
6

The construction of the spectral triple (1) depends, as mentioned, cru\u0002cially on the choice of graphs. This choice is closely related to the group\r
of diffeomorphisms acting on the Hilbert space H. We find that the choice\r
of a restricted system of graphs amounts to a type of gauge fixing of the\r
diffeomorphism group. Thus, the Hilbert space H does not carry an action\r
of any smooth diffeomorphisms. Rather, it carries an action of a discrete\r
group of diffeomorphisms associated to the inductive system of graphs. This\r
means that the construction reduces the diffeomorphism group to a countable\r
group.\r
The spectral triple (1) has a clear interpretation in terms of a non\u0002perturbative, background independent Quantum Field Theory related to\r
gravity. First of all, since the triple exists over a space of connections the\r
Dirac type operator D should be interpreted as a global functional deriva\u0002tion operator. Also, the Hilbert space H has an inner product which involves\r
a functional integral. Next, we find that the interaction between the Dirac\r
type operator D and the loop algebra B reproduces the Poisson structure\r
of General Relativity. Furthermore, the Hilbert space H is found to be\r
directly related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeomorphism invariant\r
states known from Loop Quantum Gravity [23]. The difference between the\r
two is given by the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H. Thus, we\r
interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism constraint.\r
The square of the Dirac type operator D has the form of an integral over\r
the underlying manifold M. The integrand is a quantity which, in terms of\r
canonical quantum gravity, has an interpretation as an area-squared density\r
operator. This operator resembles the area operators known in Loop Quan\u0002tum Gravity [24]. Furthermore, we suggest that pDq\r
2\r
should be interpreted\r
in terms of an action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D the form\r
of a Feynman integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an\r
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.\r
It is important to realize that the construction works in any dimension\r
and does not require a foliation of the underlying manifold.\r
The construction of the Dirac type operator D involves an infinite di\u0002mensional Clifford bundle. This structure entails the canonical anticommu\u0002tation relations (CAR) algebra, which appears as a tensor factor acting on\r
the Hilbert space H.\r
Technically, the triple (1) satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spec\u0002tral triple. This is due to the fact that the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle\r
7

entails a large degeneracy of the spectrum of D which, naively, fails to have\r
compact resolvent. The solution to this problem is, in short, to integrate\r
out the symmetry group related to this degeneracy. This process leads to a\r
semi-finite spectral triple.\r
The Dirac type operator D is gauge invariant. It is, however, not invari\u0002ant under the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H. This means\r
that D is, by itself, not an observable in a physical sense. We suggest to\r
apply a standard trick of Noncommutative Geometry: One obtains invari\u0002ant quantities by multiplying the algebra of observables with the relevant\r
symmetry group. A prime example of this method is the identification of\r
two points: By applying the noncommutative trick one obtains, besides in\u0002variance under exchange of the points, additional degrees of freedom which,\r
ultimately, leads to the Higgs mechanism. In the present case we expect this\r
general mechanism to entail further degrees of freedom.\r
Let us note in passing, that the algebra of holonomy loops that we work\r
with in this paper is smaller than the correponding algebra of Wilson loops.\r
However, the missing information is recovered by the Hopf algebra structure\r
of the algebra of holonomy loops. The missing information is coded in the\r
extra structure coming from the fact that it is given as a (norm closure of a)\r
group algebra\r
CrfL, L loops on Ss ,\r
where S denotes the entire inductive system of triangulations. As such it\r
has a Hopf algebra structure and for example the connections on M can be\r
recovered as Hopf algebra homomorphisms into the group algebra of G.\r
The construction of the Dirac type operator D is not unique. In fact,\r
we find a large class of Dirac type operators labelled by infinite sequences\r
tanu of real parameters. The operator D has compact resolvent whenever\r
the sequence diverges sufficiently fast. These parameters are related to the\r
scaling behaviour of the operator and are clearly of metric origin. Thus, in\r
order to obtain a Dirac type operator D we are forced to choose a certain\r
scaling behaviour.\r
It is clear that a correct interpretation of the sequence tanu is imperative\r
since the existence of the operator D depends crucially hereon. In this paper\r
we present one possible solution as to how these free parameters should be\r
dealt with. We propose an extension of the spectral triple (1) to include\r
the sequence tanu as dynamical degrees of freedom. The result is a new\r
triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq which is a fibration of spectral triples pB, D, Hq. We\r

Figure 1: A graph Γ with edges tǫ1, ǫ2, ǫ3, ǫ4u.\r
emphasise, however, that the question as to how the sequence tanu should\r
be understood and dealt with remains open.\r
This paper is this first of two papers concerned with the spectral triple\r
(1). This paper is primarily concerned with the general construction and\r
physical interpretation of the triple. The second paper [22] deals with the\r
concise mathematical construction.\r
1.1 Outline of the construction\r
Before we go into details we first give a brief outline of the construction. The\r
first step is concerned with the formulation of a semi-finite spectral triple over\r
a space of connections. The triple is, as mentioned, based on a \u0006-algebra of\r
loops which we denote by B. A smooth loop l gives a map from the space\r
of smooth connections, denoted A, into the structure group G\r
l : ∇ Ñ Holp∇, lq P G ,\r
where Holp∇, lq is the holonomy of the connection ∇ P A along l and G is a\r
compact connected Lie group. In order to describe the algebra of holonomy\r
loops we first restrict the loop algebra to a finite graph Γ with edges ǫi (see\r
figure 1.1). Seen from Γ the connection ∇ can be seen as point ∇ in the\r
space Gn\r
∇ \u0010 pg1, . . . , gnq P G\r
n \u0010 AΓ ,\r
9

where n is the number of edges in Γ and where gi \u0010 Holp∇, ǫiq is the holon\u0002omy transform along the i’th edge. That is, a connection is given by its\r
holonomy transforms along edges ǫi. Clearly, AΓ is a highly inaccurate pic\u0002ture of the full space A of connections. However, one can show [22] that for\r
a suitable choice of embedded graphs\r
Γ1  Γ2  Γ3 . . .  Γn  . . . (2)\r
the space A is densely contained in the limit space\r
A \u0010 limnÑ8 AΓn.\r
This provides us with the strategy to construct a spectral triple over A. With\r
the system of graphs given by nested triangulations we construct, at the level\r
of each graph Γn, a spectral triple\r
pBn, Dn, HnqΓn\r
,\r
where the algebra Bn is generated by loops in Γn, the operator Dn is some\r
Dirac operator on AΓn \u0010 Gn\r
and where Hn \u0010 L\r
2\r
pGn, ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
qq. This triple\r
is almost canonical and the little choice one has is mostly eliminated by the\r
requirement that the construction of the triple should be compatible with\r
structure maps\r
Pnm : AΓn Ñ AΓm , n ¡ m\r
between the different coarse-grained spaces of field configurations.\r
The Dirac type operator obtained in the limit is an operator on the space\r
G8\r
and is of the general form\r
a1D1  a2D2  . . .  akDk  . . .\r
where Dk is an operator corresponding to a certain level in the projective sys\u0002tem (2) and where the infinite sequence taku determines the weight assigned\r
to each operator Dk. We find that for sequences satisfying\r
lim\r
kÑ8\r
ak \u0010 8 sufficiently fast (3)\r
the limit spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq :\u0010 limnÑ8\r
pBn, Dn, HnqΓn\r
(4)\r
10

satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spectral triple.\r
The second part of the construction is more tentative. This part is con\u0002cerned with the infinite sequence taku of free parameters which enters the\r
construction of the semi-finite spectral triple pB, D, Hq. The sequence taku\r
is readily seen to carry metric data since it determines the scaling behaviour\r
of the operator D. Also, the sequence determines the measure that arises\r
in the square of D. Furthermore, the choice of parameters taku is related\r
to the invariance properties of D. Based on these observations we choose to\r
include the sequence taku as dynamical parameters in the construction. This\r
means that we first construct a spectral triple\r
pAa, Da, Haq , (5)\r
where elements in the algebra Aa are functions f px1, x2, . . .q on the moduli\r
space of sequences taku satisfying condition (3). The construction of the\r
triple (5) is inspired by Higson and Kasparov [25]. The Hilbert space Ha is\r
a L\r
2\r
space of functions over this moduli space and Da is a Dirac operator\r
hereon. Next, we merge the triple (5) with the triple (4) to obtain a total\r
spectral triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq , (6)\r
where the Dirac type operator Dt combines the operators D and Da. It\r
is important to see that the first part of the Dirac operator, the operator\r
D, depends on the parameters taku which the second part, the operator Da,\r
probes. The exact form of this interdependency, which makes the operator\r
Dt highly nontrivial, is governed by the requirement that Ha is a Hilbert\r
space over an infinite dimensional space corresponding exactly to those se\u0002quences taku which leaves the operator D θ-summable.\r
The paper is organised as follows. Sections 2 - 4 give a self contained pre\u0002sentation of the mathematical construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r
Here, section 2 introduces the basic machinery used in this paper: First the\r
loop algebra associated to an abstract simplicial complex and the concept\r
of abstract connections associated to a simplicial complex. Thereafter pro\u0002jective systems of simplicial complexes. In section 3 we construct a spectral\r
triple on the level of a simplicial complex and in section 4 we obtain the\r
triple pB, D, Hq via an inductive limit of simplicial complexes.\r
Next, sections 5 - 8 are concerned with the physical significance of the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq. In section 5 we show that the spectral triple\r
11

involves a representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity. Then\r
in section 6 we give a detailed comparison between the setup presented in\r
this paper and the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity and find that the\r
two constructions, on a technical level, differ primarily in the way the dif\u0002feomorphism group is treated. Section 7 briefly reviews area operators in\r
Loop Quantum Gravity and finds that the square of the Dirac operator D\r
has a natural interpretation as a kind of global area operator. This leads\r
naturally, in section 8, to an interpretation of the operator D2\r
 in terms of an\r
action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D a strong resemblance to\r
a partition function related to gravity.\r
Then, in section 9, we describe the construction of the spectral triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq which includes the sequence taku as dynamical variables. Finally,\r
in section 10 we mention that the Dirac type operator D defines a distance\r
on the space A\r
\r
. Sections 11 and 12 contain a discussion and conclusion.\r
Three appendices are added to outline first an extended setup which avoids\r
the choice of a basepoint and next to discuss again a notion of diffeomorphism\r
invariance. The last appendix is concerned with certain symmetric states.\r
2 Projective systems of simplicial complexes\r
As explained in the introduction, the aim is to study geometrical structures\r
over a space of connections. To do this we apply a dual picture of the space of\r
connections. This means that, rather than studying the space of connections\r
itself, we will work with an algebra of functions on the space. This algebra\r
is an algebra of loops and has a natural interpretation in terms of holonomy\r
loops.\r
The purpose of this section is to introduce the machinery needed to de\u0002scribe this algebra of loops. The strategy is to break up the algebra into\r
finite parts, introduce various geometrical structures on each finite part and\r
finally let the complexity of the construction increase infinitely to obtain the\r
full algebra of loops.\r
To emphasise the purely combinatorial nature of the construction we\r
adopt a formalism which, for the main part of the analysis, avoids any refer\u0002ence to an underlying manifold. This means that we will work with abstract\r
graphs and their loop algebras. An alternative approach is to work directly\r
with graphs on a manifold and their loop algebras. This approach, which\r
may be intuitively clearer, is applied in [22].\r

2.1 Simplicial complexes and their loop algebras\r
We first introduce the notion of an abstract graph and its associated loop\r
algebra. The abstract graphs we consider are given by simplicial complexes.\r
Consider therefore first an abstract, finite, d-dimensional simplicial complex\r
K with vertexes vi and directed edges\r
ǫj: t0, 1u Ñ tviu , ǫj p0q \u007F\u0010 ǫj p1q ,\r
connecting the vertexes. We shall refer to the two elements of the set t0, 1u\r
as start and endpoint of the edge. The construction which we present works\r
for a large class of simplicial complexes. We will, however, restrict ourselves\r
to simplicial complexes which corresponds to triangulations of d-dimensional\r
manifolds.\r
We will consider based simplicial complexes which means that the com\u0002plex has a preferred vertex v0.\r
Given a simplicial complex K we wish to describe an algebra of based\r
loops living on K. First, a path is a finite sequence L \u0010 tǫi1\r
, ǫi2, . . . , ǫinu of\r
edges in EK with the property that\r
ǫik\r

Next, a loop is a path satisfying\r
ǫi1p0q \u0010 ǫinp1q ,\r
and a based loop is a loop satisfying the additional requirement\r
ǫi1p0q \u0010 ǫinp1q \u0010 v0 .\r
13

By ǫ\r
\u0006\r
j we denote the edge ǫj with reversed direction\r
ǫ\r

pτ q \u0010 ǫj p1 \u0001 τ q , τ P t0, 1u .\r
A path may contain both edges and their reverse. We discard trivial back\u0002tracking by which we mean sequences that contain successions of edges ǫi\r
and their reverse ǫ\r
\u0006\r
i\r
. Thus, we introduce the equivalence relation\r
t. . . , ǫj, ǫk, ǫ\u0006\r
k\r
, ǫl, . . .u \u0012 t. . . , ǫj, ǫl, . . .u ,\r
and regard a path as an equivalence class with respect to this relation.\r
We define a product between two based loops Li \u0010 tǫjiu, i P t1, 2u, simply\r
by gluing\r
L1 \u0005 L2 \u0010 ttǫj1\r

Furthermore, we define the based identity loop L0 as the equivalence class\r
that includes the empty loop\r
L0 \u0010 tØu .\r
The based identity loop clearly satisfies\r
L0 \u0005 L\r

This, together with the observation that\r
L\r

\u0005 L \u0010 L \u0005 L\r
\u0006\r
\u0010 L0 ,\r
implies that, for based loops, the involution equals an inverse. This provides\r
the set of based loops with a group structure. We call the group of based\r
loops associated to K for the hoop group (holonomy loops, see [18]), denoted\r
HGK.\r
14

For the remaining part of this paper we shall consider only based loops\r
and will therefore drop the prefix ’based’.\r
We finally consider formal, finite series of loops living on a complex K\r

The set of elements of the form (7) is a Æ-algebra. We denote this algebra\r
with BK.\r
2.2 Loop group homomorphisms and connections\r
We now introduce the notion of an abstract connection. Let G be a compact,\r
connected Lie-group and, for later reference, fix a matrix representation of\r
G.\r
Next we introduce a G-bundle over a smooth manifold M and a loop l\r
in M. A smooth connection can be understood as a map\r
∇ : l Ñ ∇plq P G , (8)\r
which satisfies the condition\r
∇pl1 \u0005 l2q \u0010 ∇pl1q \u0004 ∇pl2q , (9)\r
where l1 and l2 are loops in M. Here, the map (8) is the holonomy transform\r
of ∇ along l, ∇plq \u0010 Holp∇, lq.\r
This motivates the following definition of an abstract connection as a map\r
∇ : tǫj u Ñ G , (10)\r
that associates to each edge ǫj P EK a point gj P G. The map is required to\r
satisfy\r
∇pǫj q \u0010 p∇pǫ\r
\u0006\r
j\r
qq\u00011\r
.\r
15

Denote by AK the space of all abstract connections associated to K. The\r
action of ∇ is extended to a path L \u0010 tǫi1\r
, ǫi2, . . . , ǫinu simply by\r
∇pLq \u0010 ∇pǫi1\r
q \u0004 ∇pǫi2q \u0004 . . . \u0004 ∇pǫinq , (11)\r
where the product on the rhs is matrix multiplication. This makes ∇ a\r
group homomorphism from the hoop group HGK into G which means that it\r
satisfies\r
∇pL1 \u0005 L2q \u0010 ∇pL1q \u0004 ∇pL2q .\r
This corresponds to condition (9) and justifies the terminology abstract con\u0002nection.\r
Via the space AK we can equip the Æ-algebra formed by elements of the\r
form (7) with a natural norm given by\r
}a} \u0010 sup\r
∇PAK\r
}\r
¸\r
ai∇pLiq}G , (12)\r
where the norm on the rhs of (12) is the matrix norm given by the repre\u0002sentation of G. The closure of the Æ-algebra BK of loops with respect to this\r
norm is a C\r
Æ\r
-algebra. We denote this loop algebra by BK.\r
In fact, the algebra BK is a function algebra over the space AK with values\r
in the matrix representation of the group G. A loop L gives rise to a function\r
fL via\r
fLp∇q :\u0010 ∇pLq , L P HGK , ∇ P AK .\r
Notice that the algebra of functions fL with the natural product\r
fL1\r
\u0004 fL2 \u0010 fL1\u0005L2,\r
is noncommutative whenever G is non-Abelian.\r
The space AK is identified as a manifold\r
AK \u0014 G\r
npKq\r
,\r
via the bijection\r
AK Q ∇ Ñ p∇pǫ1q, . . . , ∇pǫnpKqqq P G\r
npKq\r
. (13)\r
where npKq denotes the number of edges in VK. This identification gives rise\r
to various structures on AK. For example the topological structure is given\r
by the topological structure of GnpKq\r
.\r
16

....\r
Figure 3: The lhs shows a triangulation (dimension \u0010 2) and the rhs its two\r
first barycentric subdivisions.\r
A loop L \u0010 tǫi1\r
, ǫi2, . . . , ǫiku gives, according to (13), rise a function on\r
GnpKq\r
given by\r
fL : pg1, g2, . . . , gnpKqq Ñ gi1\r
\u0004 gi2\u0004 . . . \u0004 gikP G .\r
We think of the space AK as a ”coarse grained version of a space of\r
(smooth) connections”. To clarify this interpretation consider an embedding\r
of the simplicial complex into a triangulation\r
φ : K Ñ T (14)\r
and a trivial principal bundle P \u0010 M\u0002G. Denote by A the space of smooth\r
connections in P. There is a natural map\r
χK : A Ñ AK , χKp∇qpǫiq \u0010 Holp∇, φpǫiqq , (15)\r
where Holp∇, φpǫiqq denotes the holonomy of ∇ along the edge ǫi which now\r
lives in M via the embedding φ. This means that points in AK can be\r
understood in terms of connections. Clearly, the map (15) is not injective\r
which is exactly what is meant by ’coarse grained’. The idea is to gradually\r
increase the complexity of the simplicial complex and thereby to turn the map\r
(15) into an injection. Therefore, the next step is to introduce a refinement\r
procedure for the simplicial complex K.\r
2.3 The projective system\r
The key tool to refine the simplicial complex K is the barycentric subdivision\r
of simplexes. We will consider repeated barycentric subdivisions of K. Thus,\r
the basic element in our analysis of geometrical structures over spaces of\r
connections is an inductive systems of simplicial complexes. We start with\r
the following\r
17

Definition 2.3.1 An inductive system of simplicial complexes is a countable\r
set ptKiu, tIjkuq of nested abstract simplicial complexes Ki and embeddings\r
Ijk : Kj Ñ Kk , j   k (16)\r
so that Ijk is either a barycentric subdivision or an inversion of edges. The\r
set is required to satisfy\r
lim\r
i\r
npKiq \u0010 8 .\r
A barycentric subdivision of a simplicial complex K is here understood as the\r
simultaneous subdivision of all simplices in K.\r
The simplest simplicial complex in the inductive system is called the initial\r
complex and is denoted Ko. The orientation of the initial complex is not\r
important and one simply chooses one.\r
The embedding (16) gives rise to a projection between spaces of abstract\r
connections\r
Pn2,n1: AKn2 Ñ AKn1\r
, n2 ¥ n1 ,\r
which, via (13), is identified as a projection between manifolds\r
Pn2,n1: G\r
n2 Ñ G\r
n1\r
, n2 ¥ n1 . (17)\r
The projection Pn2,n1is given by composition of one or more of the following\r
operations:\r
• multiplying gi1 with gi2.\r
• inverting gi.\r
• leaving out some giin pg1, . . . , gn2q P Gn2.\r
The embedding (16) commute by construction with the identification\r
AK \u0014 GnpKq\r
, i.e. the diagram:\r
AKi1\r
σi1 ÝÑ GnpKi1q\r
Ó Ó\r
AKi\r
σi ÝÑ GnpKiq\r
where σiis given by (13), commutes. This means that the limit space\r
A\r
\r
:\u0010 limK\u001CÝAK\r
18

is a pro-manifold. That is, it is the projective limit of manifolds. This gives\r
us immediate access to various structures on A\r
\r
. For instance, since the\r
projections P in (17) are continuous they give a topological structure on A\r
\r
.\r
In general, the structure of a pro-manifold is a powerful tool that leads us to\r
both Hilbert space and metric structures on the limit space A\r
\r
.\r
In section 4.2 we show that the space A of smooth connections is densely\r
embedded in A\r
\r
(once a suitable embedding of the simplicial complex has\r
been applied, see (14)). This fact is the very reason for studying the space\r
A\r
\r
. It means that structures on A\r
\r
can equally be understood as structures\r
on A.\r
3 A spectral triple on a simplicial complex\r
The aim is to construct a spectral triple at the level of each simplicial complex\r
in an inductive system of simplicial complexes. The triples are required to\r
involve the loop algebras BKias function algebras over the associated spaces\r
AKiof abstract connections. To ensure that the limit of increased complex\u0002ity is well defined we require the spectral triples to be compatible with all\r
projections induced by the inductive system of complexes. This means that\r
geometrical structures over AKi will converge to geometrical structures over\r
A\r
\r
.\r
3.1 Outline of the construction.\r
Before we go into details let us outline the construction of the spectral triple\r
at the level of a simplicial complex K. The starting point is the manifold\r
AK \u0014 GnpKq\r
. It is natural to consider first the Hilbert space\r
HK \u0010 L\r
2\r
pG\r
npKq\r
q ,\r
where L\r
2\r
is with respect to the Haar measure on GnpKq\r
. Since we wish to\r
construct both a Dirac operator acting on HK and to have a representation\r
of the algebra BK on HK we need to equip the Hilbert space with additional\r
structure. Consider therefore instead the Hilbert space\r
HK \u0010 L\r
2\r
pG\r
npKq\r
, ClpT\r
\u0006\r
G\r
npKq\r
q b MlpCqq , (18)\r
where l is the size of the representation of G and ClpT\r
\u0006GnpKq\r
q is the Clif\u0002ford bundle involving the cotangent bundle over GnpKq\r
. If we recall that\r
19

points in GnpKq\r
represents homomorphisms ∇ from the hoop group into G\r
we immediately have a representation of the loop algebra BK on HK\r
fL \u0004 ψp∇q \u0010 p1 b ∇pLqq \u0004 ψp∇q , ψ P HK , (19)\r
where the first factor acts on the Clifford part of the Hilbert space and the\r
second factor acts by matrix multiplication on the matrix part of the Hilbert\r
space. Finally, we choose some Dirac operator DK on GnpKq\r
and obtain the\r
triple\r
pBK, DK, HKq , (20)\r
on the level of the simplicial complex K.\r
It is not difficult to construct the candidate (20) for a spectral triple on\r
the space AK. The crucial point, however, is to ensure that the construction\r
is compatible with the induced projections between the simplicial complexes\r
(17). This requirement turns out to restrict the choice of Dirac operator on\r
AK considerably.\r
To ease the notation we shall from now on write Aifor AKi, Bifor BKi,\r
Hifor HKi, Difor DKiand nifor npKiq.\r
3.2 Notation and basic setup\r
Before we proceed with the construction we need some preparations. A point\r
pg1, . . . , gnq P Gnis denoted ¯g. Let Rg denote right translation on the group\r
G, i.e. Rg phq \u0010 hg. Accordingly, Lg denotes left translation. We also denote\r
by Rg the corresponding differential, Rg : ThG Ñ ThgG. Lg likewise. Given\r
a cotangent vector φ at the identity we define the right translated cotangent\r
vector field Rφ by:\r
Rφpgqpvq \u0010 φpRg\u00011 pvqq , v P TgG .\r
The left translated cotangent vector fields are defined equivalently. Given a\r
projection P : Gn Ñ Gm we denote by P\u0006 the corresponding differential\r
P\u0006 : Tg¯G\r
n Ñ TP pg¯qGm\r
and by P\r
\u0006\r
the induced map on cotangent spaces\r
P\r
\u0006\r
: T\r
\u0006\r
P pg¯q G\r
m Ñ T\r
\u0006\r
g¯ G\r
n\r
.\r
20

Consider the particular projection\r
P : G\r
2 Ñ G ; pg1, g2q Ñ g1 \u0004 g2 .\r
An element in pv1, v2q P Tpg1,g2q G2\r
transforms according to\r
P\u0006pv1, v2q Ñ pRg2\r
v1  Lg1v2q ,\r
which is best seen by writing v1 \u0010 γ9 1pτ q|τ\u00100 where\r
γ1pτ q \u0010 pγ11pτ q, g2q P G\r
2\r
is the one parameter subgroup in G2 generated by v1. P clearly maps γ1pτ q\r
into γ11pτ q \u0004 g2 \u0010 Rg2γ11pτ q P G. The same argument applies to v2. Corre\u0002spondingly, given an element of the cotangent bundle φ P T\r
\u0006\r
g1 \u0004g2G the dual\r
maps yields\r
P\r

3.3 The Hilbert space\r
To construct the Hilbert space related to a simplicial complex Ki we first\r
construct an inner product on T\r
\u0006Gni\r
. We choose a left and right invariant\r
metric on G. The edges in K are numbered with 1, . . . , ni. In the following\r
we shall occasionally write n instead of ni \u0010 npKiq. Consider two elements\r
φ1, φ2 P T\r
\u0006\r
g¯ Gni\r
. We write φk \u0010 pφk1, . . . , φknq and define the inner product\r
by\r
xφ1|φ2yg¯ \u0010\r
1\r
2\r
N\r
¸n\r
j\u00101\r
xφ1j|φ2j y\r
G\r
gj\r
, (22)\r
where x\u0004|\u0004yG\r
gj\r
is the inner product on T\r
\u0006\r
gjG. In (22) N is the number5 of\r
barycentric subdivision between the simplicial complex Ki and the initial\r
5There is some freedom in the choice of N. We could also introduce a factor Nj asso\u0002ciated to each individual edge ǫj . Here, Nj counts the number of barycentric subdivisions\r
that lies between the edge ǫj and the simplest complex Kk (k   j) that has the edge ǫj as\r
a segment of an edge in Kk. This choice therefore associated different weights to edges in\r
a simplicial complex according to their position in the complex.\r

complex Ko. In [22] we prove that the inner product (22) is compatible with\r
projections induced by embeddings (16).\r
With the inner product (22) on T\r
\u0006Gn we construct the Clifford bundle\r
ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q and define an inner product on the Hilbert space (18)\r
x\u0004|\u0004y \u0010\r
»\r
dµ \u0004 Tr \u0004x\u0004|\u0004yCl , (23)\r
where dµ is the Haar measure on Gn, Tr is the trace on Ml and x\u0004|\u0004yCl is the\r
inner product of the Clifford bundle ClpT\r
\u0006Gn\r
q. The inner product (23) is\r
compatible with projections (16). This gives us the Hilbert space (18).\r
3.4 The Dirac operator\r
The Dirac-like operator on each space Aiis required to be compatible with\r
the projections in the inductive system of complexes. Thus, the induced\r
maps\r
P\r
\u0006\r
: T\r
\u0006\r
G\r
m Ñ T\r
\u0006\r
G\r
n\r
, m   n , (24)\r
give rise to the compatibility conditions\r
P\r
\u0006\r
pDmvqpg1, . . . , gnq \u0010 DnpP\r
\u0006\r
vqpg1, . . . , gnq , (25)\r
where v P L\r
2\r
pGm, ClpT\r
\u0006Gmqq. These conditions largely restrict the Dirac\u0002like operator Di on Ki\r
. On the initial complex Ko with the corresponding\r
22

manifold Gno the Dirac operator is chosen to have the canonical form6\r
Do \u0010\r
¸\r
i,j\r
e\r
i\r
j\r
\u0004 ∇lc\r
eˆ\r
i\r
j\r
, (26)\r
where te\r
i\r
j\r
u is a global basis on T\r
\u0006G corresponding to the i’th copy of G. teˆ\r
i\r
j\r
u\r
is the corresponding basis on T G, obtained from te\r
i\r
j\r
u via the inner product\r
(22). ∇lc is the Levi-Civita connection on G.\r
The problem is therefore to find a Dirac operator on Gni compatible with\r
projections (16). Here, it is sufficient to deal with an edge ǫ and its partitions\r
generated by barycentric subdivisions of the complex to which ǫ belongs, see\r
figure 4. Once the operator is constructed here we obtain an operator on the\r
entire system of simplicial complexes by gluing the individual operators in\r
an obvious manner.\r
The generic problem is the projection\r
P : G\r
2 Ñ G ; pg1, g2q Ñ g1 \u0004 g2 , (27)\r
which we now consider together with the induced map between cotangent\r
bundles (21). Let teiu be an orthonormal basis of T\r
\u0006\r
idG and denote by\r
eipgq \u0010 Lgeipidq \u0011 ei\r
the left-translated basis covectors at g P G. The push-forward of the basis\r
covector eipgq in T\r
\u0006\r
pg1,g2q G by P\r
\u0006\r
gives\r
P\r

where g \u0010 g1 \u0004 g2. This suggests a natural orthonormal basis of T\r

the Levi-Civita connection. However, to obtain a self-adjoint operator certain invariance\r
properties must be satisfied [22].\r

which is required for the construction of the trace, see section 4.1 and [22].\r
The properties given in (34) are again dictated by the requirement that the\r
Dirac operator (33) is compatible with the projections.\r
The proof that the operator (33) satisfies the compatibility condition (25)\r
is given in [22].\r
3.5 The general Dirac operator associated to Ki\r
The Dirac type operator (33) is not the most general operator satisfying the\r
requirements of compatibility with the structure maps (25). In fact, these\r
requirements renders substantial parts of the operator (33) free to modifi\u0002cations. This observation is closely related to the fact that the Dirac type\r
operator (33) will, at it stands, not descend to an operator with a compact\r
resolvent in the inductive limit of repeated barycentric subdivisions. It turns\r
out that the additional degrees of freedom are exactly the necessary leverage\r
needed to obtain a well-behaved Dirac type operator in the limit.\r
25

Let us start with the case n \u0010 2. We observe that a rescaling of parts of\r

the general case, the modification of (33) is as follows: Let tak u be an infinite\r
sequence of real numbers and put a0 \u0010 1. Consider a single edge ǫ and its\r
subdivisions. Consider the n’th subdivision. Let s be a finite sequence of n\r
signs and denote by #psq the number of ’+’s in the beginning of the sequence.\r

Let us consider the eigenvalues of this operator. For simplicity, consider\r
the Abelian case G \u0010 U p1q. If we define the product between a sequence\r
s \u0010 p, \b, \b, . . .q of signs with a sequence of real numbers7\r
pn1, n1, . . .q by\r
pn1, n2, . . .q \u0004 s \u0010 n1 \b n2 \b . . . (37)\r
where the signs on the rhs are read of the sequence s, then we can write the\r
spectrum of the Dirac type operator (36) as\r

26

The general case where G is a non-Abelian Lie-group is more complicated.\r
The full analysis is given in [22] where we prove that for any compact Lie\u0002group G there exist a sequence taiu so that the number of eigenvalues within\r
a finite range is finite up to a controllable degeneracy. This result will be\r
clarified in the next section.\r
4 The limit of the triple pBn, Dn, Hnq\r
Up till now we have considered a system of embedded, abstract simplicial\r
complexes tKnu. To each simplicial complex Kn we introduced a space An\r
which we interpreted as a coarse-grained version of a space of connections.\r
The next step was to construct a spectral triple pBn, Dn, Hnq on each of the\r
spaces An. The spectral triple satisfies requirements of compatibility with\r
the operation of barycentric subdivision. This means that we can take the\r
limit of infinitely many barycentric subdivisions. The resulting triple, which\r
is denoted by pB, D, Hq, has the following elements:\r
First, the Hilbert space H is constructed by adding all Hilbert spaces\r
Hn\r
H1\r
\u0010 `KL\r
2\r
pG\r
npKq\r
, ClpT\r
\u0006\r

q b MlpCqq{N , (39)\r
where N is the subspace generated by elements of the form\r
p. . . , v, . . . , \u0001P\r
\u0006\r
ij pvq, . . .q ,\r
where P\r
\u0006\r
ij are maps between Hilbert spaces Hn induced by (24). The Hilbert\r
space H is the completion of H1\r
. The inner product on H is the inductive\r
limit inner product. This Hilbert space is manifestly separable. Next, the\r
algebra\r
B :\u0010 limKÝÑ\r
BK . (40)\r
contains loops defined on a simplicial complex Kn in tKnu as well as their\r
closure. Again, the algebra B is separable. Finally, the Dirac-like operator\r
Dn descends to a densely defined operator on the limit space H\r
D \u0010 limKÝÑDn . (41)\r
27

4.1 A semi-finite spectral triple\r
The question is whether the triple pB, D, Hq satisfies the requirements of\r
a spectral triple. Clearly, to have a true spectral triple is highly desirable,\r
first of all to ensure that we are operating on mathematically safe ground.\r
Also, the toolbox of Noncommutative Geometry is a rich one. It provides\r
not only metric structures to the underlying spaces involved, it also involves\r
aspects which does not exist in ordinary Riemannian geometry.\r
To have a spectral triple pB, D, H q where B is a C\r
Æ\r
-algebra represented\r
on a Hilbert space H on which an unbounded, selfadjoint operator D acts,\r
means that the two requirements\r
1. pλ \u0001 Dq\u00011\r
, where λ R R, is a compact operator\r
2. rb, Ds, where b P B, is a bounded operator and where B is a dense\r
Æ-subalgebra of B\r
are satisfied. However, the triple pB, D, Hq is not spectral in this sense.\r
The spectrum of D involves a large degeneracy due to the infinite dimen\u0002sional Clifford bundle. This means that the resolvent of D will not be com\u0002pact.\r
There exist, however, another sense in which a triple pB, D, H q can be\r
called spectral. If there exist a trace on the algebra containing B and the\r
spectral projections of D, then pB, D, H q is called a semi-finite spectral triple\r
if pλ \u0001 Dq\u00011\r
is compact with respect to this trace.\r
It turns out that the triple pB, D, Hq does form a semi-finite spectral\r
triple. The sufficient requirement is that the sequence taku satisfies\r
lim\r
k\r
ak Ñ 8 , sufficiently fast . (42)\r
A semi-finite spectral triple can be thought of as a spectral triple which\r
involves a redundant symmetry group. This symmetry group resembles a\r
gauge group and one must integrate out the extra degrees of freedom. In the\r
present case the symmetry group is identified as the endomorphisms of the\r
infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. To deal with this redundancy we first\r
define a trace on the algebra containing B as well as the spectral projections\r
of D.\r
We will construct the trace at each level in the inductive system of sim\u0002plicial complexes and subsequently take the limit of repeated barycentric\r
28

subdivisions. For the construction we factorize the Hilbert space. Choose a\r
global orthonormal frame in T\r
\u0006\r
e G. This choice gives rise to a decomposition\r
L\r
2\r
pG\r
n\r
, Ml b ClpT\r
\u0006\r

2\r
pG\r
n\r
q b MlpCq b ClpT\r
\u0006\r
e G\r
n\r
q. (43)\r
We will construct the trace on the algebra\r
Cn \u0010 KpL\r
2\r
pG\r
n\r
qq b EndpMlq b EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e G\r
n\r
qq.\r
where K here denotes the compact operators.\r
Let T rop denote the operator trace on KpL\r
2\r
pGnqq. For each n we have\r
the normalised trace tr on EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e Gn\r
qq. We define the trace as\r
T r \u0010 T rop b T rl b tr. (44)\r
Note that the trace is independent of the choice of global orthonormal frame\r
in T\r
\u0006G, since a different choice of basis is given by a unitary transformation.\r
In [22] we prove that the limit\r
C :\u0010 lim Cn\r
will be a C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra and that the trace T r gives a trace on C. Since C\r
is contained in the weak closure of B the trace extends to a trace on B as\r
well.\r
The important point in this construction is the normalisation of the trace\r
tr on EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e Gn\r
qq. To explain this consider the step going from n to\r
n  m. Let Pλ be the spectral projection of Dn for the eigenvalue λ. Going\r
from n to n  m the spectral projection will roughly speaking be mapped\r
to Pλ b 1. Thus the size of the eigenspace λ grows in the same rate as the\r
dimension of the Clifford bundle. To remedy this defect we must ensure that\r
trp1q \u0010 1 ,\r
which is what the normalised trace does.\r
The proof that pB, D, Hq form a semi-finite spectral triple with respect\r
to the trace (44) is given in [22]. It turns out that in general the Dirac-type\r
operator (41) may require a perturbation at each level in the inductive sys\u0002tem. This perturbation deals with the fact that the operators Dn may, in\r
general, have nontrivial kernels which obstructs the control of the eigenvalues\r
of the limit operator D. These perturbations lift the entailed degeneracy,\r
29

which would otherwise destroy the spectral properties of the triple. The re\u0002quired perturbation is, at each level in the projective system, bounded and\r
does not affect the commutator between D and the algebra B significantly.\r
For the special case G \u0010 SU p2q we find that the operators Dn have trivial\r
kernels and therefore that no perturbations are needed.\r
To recapitulate, we have successfully constructed a large class of semi\u0002finite spectral triples pB, D, Hq. The triples are labelled by infinite se\u0002quences taku of real numbers satisfying limk ak Ñ 8 sufficiently fast.\r
Let us end this section with a short discussion of the structure of the\r
Hilbert space H the role of the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. Consider\r
first the decomposition in (43) and rewrite it in the suggestive form\r
L\r
2\r
pG\r
n\r
q b MlpCq b ClpT\r
\u0006\r
e G\r
n\r
q \u0010 Hn,b b Hn,f ,\r
where Hn,b \u0010 L\r
2\r
pGnq b MlpCq. In the inductive limit this leads to the\r
decomposition\r
H \u0010 H,b b H,f .\r
Next we factorize the algebra H according to the above factorisation of the\r
Hilbert space. The result is\r
C \u0010 KpH,bq b C,\r
where\r
C \u0010 limn\r
EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e G\r
n\r
qq,\r
where the morphisms in this inductive system are the unital ones. In par\u0002ticular C is a UHF-algebra and since ClpT\r
\u0006\r
e Gn\r
q has dimension 2n\u0004dimpGq, the\r
C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra C is isomorphic to the CAR algebra.\r
The CAR algebra is an integral element of fermionic Quantum Field The\u0002ory. We find it interesting that this algebra naturally emerges from the triple\r
pB, D, Hq which, a priori, is an entirely ’bosonic’ construction. In section\r
11 we shall comment further on the appearance of the CAR algebra.\r
4.2 The space A\r
\r
and generalised connections\r
We have already indicated that the space A\r
\r
is a space of generalised connec\u0002tions. This means that it is a closure of the space A of smooth G-connections.\r
30

...\r
M M\r
T1 T2\r
Figure 5: The embedding of the system tKiu into M gives rise to an inductive\r
system of triangulations tTiu.\r
To see this consider the embedding φ of the simplicial complex Ki\r
Ti:\u0010 φpKiq ,\r
where Tiis a triangulation of the manifold M. There is a natural map\r
χ : A Ñ A\r
\r
, χp∇qpφpǫiqq \u0010 Holp∇, φpǫiqq , (45)\r
where Holp∇, φpǫiqq is the holonomy of ∇ along the edge φpǫiq which now has\r
a location in M via the embedding φ. Further, if we are given two different\r
connections ∇1, ∇2 P A they will differ in a point, say m P M, and hence\r
in a neighbourhood of m. We can therefore choose a small, directed edge\r
φpǫiq in a triangulation Ti that is sufficiently refined, so that φpǫiq lies in the\r
neighbourhood of m where the connections ∇1 and ∇2 differ. Furthermore,\r
because the system of triangulations contain edges in all directions in M we\r
can choose φpǫiq so that\r
Holp∇1, φpǫiqq \u007F\u0010 Holp∇2, φpǫiqq .\r
In other words, χ is an embedding, and hence the terminology generalised\r
connection is justified.\r
This means that we have successfully turned the map (15) into an injec\u0002tion by repeating the barycentric subdivisions of the simplicial complexes.\r
The identification of A\r
\r
as a space of connections provides us with a new\r
understanding of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. First, as already mentioned,\r
31

according to (45) the algebra of loops should be interpreted in terms of\r
holonomy loops\r
fLp∇q \u0012 HolpL, ∇q .\r
It is a well known result (see [26] and [27] and references therein) that the\r
complete set of holonomies, as well as their associated Wilson loops, contain\r
the full information, up to gauge transformations, about the underlying space\r
of smooth connections. The fact that the map (45) is an injection means that\r
the algebra B, which involves a highly restricted set of loops, does in fact\r
contain the same information about the underlying space of connections as\r
does the full set of smooth or piece-wise analytic loops.\r
Second, since the Dirac-type operator D is a derivation on the space A\r
\r
it should be understood in terms of a functional derivation operator\r
D \u0012\r
δ\r
δ∇\r
in some integrated sense which shall become clearer soon. Finally, elements\r
in the Hilbert space H are functions over field configurations of connections\r
and the inner product in H comes in the form of a functional integral\r
xΨp∇q| . . . |Ψp∇qy \u0012\r
»\r
A\r
\r
rd∇s . . . , Ψ P H . (46)\r
That is, an integral8 over A\r
\r
.\r
All together it is clear that the construction should be interpreted in\r
terms of Quantum Field Theory.\r
Notice that the diffeomorphism group diff(M) has no natural action on\r
A\r
\r
or the algebra B, except for a few, discrete diffeomorphisms. We shall\r
comment on this fact in section 6.2.\r
4.3 Gauge transformations\r
It remains to clarify whether the Dirac type operator D is gauge invariant.\r
To this end let U be an element of the gauge group G of M \u0002 P, i.e. U :\r
8This integral resembles functional integrals found elsewhere in physics. First, it is\r
similar to the inner product on the Hilbert space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states\r
in Loop Quantum Gravity, see below. Second, it also resembles functional integrals in\r
lattice gauge theories. Here, the main difference is the ’lattice spacing’ a in lattice gauge\r
theories which gives the continuum limit a Ñ 0.\r
32

M Ñ G is a smooth function. Given a connection ∇ P A, U induces a gauge\r
transformed connection ∇˜ . Given a path L with startpoint x1 and endpoint\r
x2 the holonomy along L transforms according to\r
Holp∇, Lq Ñ U px1qHolp∇, LqU\r
\u0006\r
px2q .\r
To determine the properties of the Dirac type operator D when subjected to\r
a gauge transformation we consider first the case An \u0010 Gnthat corresponds\r
to n divisions of a single edge. Consider the general transformation\r
Un : G\r
n Ñ G\r

where u0, u1, . . . , un are unitary group elements in G. This transformation\r
generates a map\r
Un : L\r

In [22] we find that (47) holds whenever the connections used to construct\r
Dn satisfy a certain gauge compatibility condition. In particular, we find\r
that the special flat connections entering the construction of Dn do satisfy\r
this condition. This, in turn, implies that the full Dirac type operator D is\r
gauge invariant. For the full analysis we refer the reader to [22].\r
4.4 The commutator between D and the algebra B\r
Section 5 is concerned with the relation between the Poisson algebra of Gen\u0002eral Relativity and the algebra B. The point is that the interaction between\r
the Dirac type operator D and the algebra B equals the interaction between\r
conjugate variables of gravity. Before we show this we need to calculate the\r
commutator between the operator (36) and a loop operator.\r
First of all, the commutator is non vanishing\r
rD, bs \u007F\u0010 0 , b P B\r
since, on the level of refinement corresponding to n edges, b is a non-trivial\r
matrix valued function on Gn and D is the Dirac-type operator on Gn.\r
33

Consider first the simple case where a loop Lj corresponds to the function\r
on Gn\r
fLj: pg1, . . . , gnq Ñ gj\r
.\r
Thus, the loop Ljis really just the j’th edge. We wish to calculate the\r
commutator\r
rdEˆj\r
i\r
, fLjsξpg1, . . . , gnq ,\r
where ξ P L\r
2\r
pGnq. If we denote by ei the generators of the Lie algebra g,\r
then we introduce the twisted generators of g\r
E\r
j\r
i \u0010 gj1gj2 . . . gneig\r
\u00011\r
n\r
. . . g\u00011\r
j1\r
corresponding to Eˆj\r
i\r
. We now calculate\r
rdEˆj\r

It is important to notice that product in the last line of (48) is a matrix\r
multiplication.\r
Equation (48) implies that9\r

The sign on the rhs of (49) correspond to the j’th sign in the sequence s.\r
Thus, for i \u0010 1 all the signs are positive and else the total number of ’s\r
and \u0001’s are equal.\r
Next, the commutator between D and a general loop L\r
fL : pg1, . . . , gnq Ñ gi1\r
gi2. . . gik.\r
simply consist of repeated applications of p49q according to\r
rD, fLs \u0010 rD, fLi1sgi2. . . gik  gi1rD, fLi2s . . . gik  . . . (50)\r
9we here consider the subdivision of an edge into n segments. Therefore, Dn is the\r
operator given by (36).\r
34

where each commutator on the rhs is calculated by inserting the appropriate\r
operator Dn corresponding to the level of refinement given by the loop L.\r
Thus, the action of D on a single loop is to insert the ’twisted’ generators\r
E\r
j\r
i\r
of the Lie-algebra into the loop at each vertex the loop passes through\r
and to multiply with an appropriate element in the Clifford bundle.\r
4.5 The role of the sequence tanu\r
In section 9 we will include the sequence tanu as dynamical variables in the\r
construction. To motivate this step we need a better understanding of the\r
sequence tanu and the role it plays in the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r
Primarily, the role of the sequence tanu is to shift an otherwise impossible\r
degeneracy in the spectrum of the operator D via the condition (42). The\r
parameters aiintroduces a hierarchy between the eigenvalues of D on the\r
infinitely many copies of G in A\r
\r
. This hierarchy is closely related to the\r
scaling behaviour of the construction.\r
Consider first a line segment divided in two, corresponding to the projec\u0002tion\r
P : G\r
2 Ñ G .\r
Functions on G2 naturally fall into two classes: push-forward of functions on\r
G\r
P\r
\u0006\r
: L\r
2\r
pGq Ñ L\r
2\r
pG\r
2\r
q , pP\r
\u0006\r
f qpg1 \u0004 g2q ,\r
and the orthogonal complement hereof. We denote the former V and the\r
latter VK \u0011 pP\r
\u0006\r
L\r
2\r
pGqqK. Functions in V correspond to information which is\r
also contained in the less refined picture which involves only one copy of G.\r
This is the simplest and most coarse-grained description of parallel transports\r
along the line segment available. Function in VK, on the other hand, contain\r
additional information which cannot be traced back to the simpler picture.\r
Each additional division of the line segment refines the picture further.\r
It is clear that any division of a line segment into two will involve new\r
segments which are shorter - independently of any choice of metric - than\r
the original segment. Therefore, functions in VK correspond to information\r
about A\r
\r
which is deeper, i.e. at a shorter distance, compared to information\r
carried by functions in V .\r
The role of the sequence taiu is to take this scaling behaviour into account.\r
The operator D weights functions on A\r
\r
according to where in the projective\r
system of spaces Ai the information originates (see figure 6). Therefore, if\r

pA\r
\r
q is the push-forward of functions on L\r
2\r
pAiq then the\r
corresponding eigenvalues of ψ are weighted with the appropriate parameter\r
ai.\r
Thus, if we wish to probe A\r
\r
at a very short distance, this information\r
will come with a very high weight factor ai corresponding to high energy.\r
On the other hand, if A\r
\r
is probed at a more coarse-grained level, then the\r
corresponding eigenvalues are weighted with smaller weights ai.\r
Let us end this subsection with a curious observation. If we start with a\r
meter, then we find that it takes about 116 subdivisions of the meter to reach\r
the Planck length of 1.6 \u0002 10\u000135 meter. This corresponds then to 116 of the\r
parameters taiu. Thus, although the sequence taiu is infinite, the number of\r
parameters involved when probing physical scales is certainly finite.\r
5 Link to canonical quantum gravity I. Op\u0002erator brackets.\r
In the next two sections we relate the construction of the spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq to canonical quantization of field theories and in particular to\r
canonical quantum gravity.\r
The first section is concerned with the Poisson brackets of General Rel\u0002ativity. We first introduce the formulation of General Relativity based on\r
Ashtekar variables. The fact that this formulation has a gauge connection\r
as a primary variable is the Raison D’´etre for the study of spaces of connec\u0002tions in this paper. Next, we show that the interaction between the Dirac\r
36

type operator D with the algebra B reproduces the structure of the Poisson\r
brackets of General Relativity when these are formulated in terms of loop\r
variables. This means that the triple pB, D, Hq includes a representation\r
of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity.\r
Section 6 is primarily concerned with a more detailed comparison between\r
the construction presented in this paper (the choice of graphs, the Hilbert\r
space) and the study of spaces of connections within Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
It turns out that the key difference between the two lies in the treatment of\r
the diffeomorphism group. We find that the Hilbert space H is directly\r
related to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant states known from\r
Loop Quantum Gravity. The difference between the two is a group of discrete\r
diffeomorphisms. This means that the representation of the Poisson brackets\r
given by the triple pB, D, Hq includes partial diffeomorphism invariance as\r
a first principle.\r
For the remaining part of this section we will, unless otherwise stated,\r
restrict ourselves to G \u0010 SU p2q and dimension three.\r
5.1 Canonical gravity\r
For an introduction to canonical gravity see for example [28, 29]. Let us first\r
fix some notation. We follow [29] and [30]. Consider the vierbein formulation\r
of General Relativity where EA\r
µ\r
is the vierbein and gµν \u0010 EA\r
µ EBν\r
ηAB is the\r
corresponding space-time metric where ηAB \u0010 t\u00011, 1, 1, 1u. Here µ, ν, . . . and\r
A, B, ... denote curved and flat space-time indices respectively. We assume\r
that space-time can be foliated according to M \u0010 Σ\u0002 R where Σ is a spatial\r
manifold. Let m, n, . . . and a, b, . . . denote curved and flat spatial indices,\r
respectively. Denote by e\r
a\r
m the spatial dreibein. The spin connection ωµAB\r
is given by\r
ωµAB \u0010 E\r
ν\r
A∇µEBν ,\r
where ∇µ is the covariant derivative which involves the Christoffel connec\u0002tion.\r

The Hamiltonian formulation of gravity involves a set of 3 constraints10 re\u0002lated to the symmetries of the theory: the Gauss constraint corresponding\r
to gauge invariance; the diffeomorphism constraint corresponding to spatial\r
diffeomorphisms within Σ; the Hamiltonian constraint encoding the full 4-\r
dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and thus containing the dynamics of\r
General Relativity. The diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints corre\u0002sponds to 4 of the 10 Einstein field equations. The Hamiltonian itself is a\r
linear combination of the two constraints. In the quantum theory, this leads\r
to the famous Wheeler-DeWitt equation.\r

the parameter γ \u007F\u0010 0 in (52) is known as the ’Barbero-Immirzi parameter’\r
[31, 32].\r
The identification of a gauge connection Ama as a primary variable of\r
General Relativity permits applications of techniques from Yang-Mills theory.\r
In particular, one might shift focus from connections to their holonomies [11]\r

To obtain the Poisson brackets pick a curve C \u0010 C1 \u0004 C2 which intersects\r
S at the single point C1 X C2. Then the Poisson bracket between the new\r
variables reads [33]\r

where ιpC, Sq \u0010 \b1 or 0 encodes information about the intersection of S and\r
C (ιpC, Sq vanishes when C and S do not intersect).\r
Notice that the structure of the bracket (55) is identical to structure of the\r
commutators (49) and (50) between the loop algebra B and the Dirac type\r
operator D. Both set of commutators prescribe an insertion of an element\r
in the Lie-algebra into the loop or curve at an ”intersection point”: either\r
at the intersection between the surface S and the curve C, or at the vertex\r
between neighbouring edges in a given simplicial complex. To investigate this\r
correspondence we first need to consider the canonical quantization approach\r
to Quantum Gravity.\r
5.2 Canonical Quantum Gravity\r
When the canonical quantization procedure is applied to gravity the philoso\u0002phy is to rewrite Poisson brackets like (51), (53) or (55) as operator brackets\r
and represent the canonical variables on a suitable Hilbert space as multipli\u0002cation and derivation operators. Clearly, there is a freedom in choice as to\r
which variables should be represented as multiplication operators and which\r
should be represented as differential operators. Using Ashtekars variables it\r
is possible to represent the holonomies HolC pAq as multiplication operators\r
HolC pAq Ñ C\r
and the corresponding triad and flux variables E˜ and F as differential oper\u0002ators\r

Figure 7: Repeated division of an edge ǫ in the initial simplicial complex.\r
on a suitable Hilbert space corresponding to a configuration space of connec\u0002tions. In the following we refer to the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
We postpone to section 6 the construction of the Hilbert space on which the\r
operators C and F are represented within Loop Quantum Gravity. For now\r
it suffices to state that the Hilbert space is based on a projective system of\r
piecewise analytic graphs. Therefore, we assume that the bracket\r
rF\r
a\r
S\r
, Cs \u0010 \bγC1τ\r
aC2 , (57)\r
where C \u0010 C1 \u0004 C2 is piecewise analytic, is defined as an operator bracket act\u0002ing on a Hilbert space of functions over a configuration space of connections.\r
We wish to show that the spectral triple pB, D, Hq reproduces the\r
operator bracket (57). To do this we will use the operators F\r
a\r
S\r
to construct\r
a new operator D. The commutator between this operator and an operator\r
C is then shown to be identical to the commutator between the Dirac type\r
operator D and an element of the algebra B.\r
To proceed we restrict the algebra (57) to an inductive system of simplicial\r
complexes tKiu and an embedding hereof φpKiq \u0010 Ti P M. Thus, we consider\r
only curves Cj which coincide with edges11 ǫjin the some triangulation Ti.\r
To simplify matters further we first consider a single edge ǫ in the initial\r
complex K0. This edge corresponds to a sequence of edges tǫ1, ǫ2, . . . , ǫ2N u\r
in the i’th triangulation Ti arising through N barycentric subdivisions, see\r
figure 7. For simplicity we set γ \u0010 1. For each edge ǫj there exist a set of\r
sections Eˆj\r

We chose Sk in a way so that the sign in (58) is always positive when the\r
orientation of the curve Ck coincide with the orientation of the triangulation.\r
The commutator (58) has the same structure as the commutator (48)\r
between the vector field Eˆj\r
i\r
and the group element corresponding to the j’th\r
copy of G in Gn. This suggest that the vector field Eˆj\r

E\r
n,s\r
i\r
and the ’\u0004’ in the bracket to the right is defined in (37). Then, the final\r
commutator reads\r

41

In (61) the sign on the rhs is again given by the i’th entries in the sequences\r
s. The commutator (61) has precisely the same form as the commutator (49).\r
This shows that the operator Dn corresponds exactly to the Dirac operator\r
Dn defined in equation (36):\r
Dn Ø Dn .\r
Notice also that the choice of surfaces Sk has no importance for the defi\u0002nition of (60). Only the intersection points, the vertices, counts. Therefore,\r
the surfaces Sk serve merely as labels of the vertices.\r
The generalisation to the full picture where we consider the complete set\r
of edges tǫku in Ti\r
is straightforward. The corresponding operator, which we\r
again denote Dn, is simply build from the operators associated to each edge\r
ǫk in the initial triangulation T0. Further, we denote the limiting operator\r
with D. Again, the message is that the operator D corresponds exactly to\r
the Dirac like operator D. The difference is that D is written in terms of\r
variables from canonical quantum gravity.\r
This shows that the spectral triples pB, D, Hq constructed in section\r
4.1 give a representation of the Poisson brackets (55). The representation is\r
separable and based on a system of graphs dense in M.\r
In which sense does the representation of the Poisson algebra (55) given\r
by the triple pB, D, Hq differ by the representation used in Loop Quantum\r
Gravity? To answer this question we need a precise comparison of the gen\u0002eral setup used in this paper with the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
This will be the topic of the next section.\r
For later reference we need an expression for the square of the Dirac-like\r
operator (60). We write\r

6 Link to Canonical Quantum Gravity II. Dif\u0002feomorphisms.\r
In this section we first introduce the inductive system of piecewise analytic\r
graphs applied in Loop Quantum Gravity. This system entail a space of\r
generalised connections much alike the space A\r
\r
constructed in this paper.\r
We find that the essential difference between the two spaces is separability.\r
This issue is closely related to the manner in which the diffeomorphism group\r
is treated in Loop Quantum Gravity and this paper respectively.\r
These insights lead us to consider the role of diffeomorphism invariance\r
in Quantum Gravity, in particular the diffeomorphism constraints found in\r
Loop Quantum Gravity. We find that the Hilbert space H is, up to a discrete\r
symmetry group, identical to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism invariant\r
states in Loop Quantum Gravity.\r
6.1 Functional spaces of connections in Loop Quantum\r
Gravity\r
The following is a review of material known in Loop Quantum Gravity. In\r
particular, we refer to the publications [18, 19, 34].\r
Let M be a real analytic manifold and let P be the space of piecewise\r
analytic directed paths on M. We will consider two paths in P to be the same\r
if they differs by trivial backtracking. P has a product simply by composing\r
paths. We define the space of generalised G-connections by\r
A\r
a\r
\u0010 HompP, Gq , (63)\r
where Hom means maps ∇ from P to G satisfying\r
∇pP1P2q \u0010 ∇pP1q∇pP2q .\r
The space A\r
a\r
was studied in [19].\r
Again, we consider the space A of smooth G-connections. We repeat the\r
argument of section 4.2: There is a natural map χa : A Ñ A\r
a\r
given by\r
χap∇qpP q \u0010 Holp∇, P q ,\r
where Holp∇, P q denoted the holonomy of ∇ along P. If we are given two\r
different smooth connections ∇1, ∇2 P A they are going to differ in a point,\r
43

let us say m, and hence also in a neighbourhood of m. We can therefore\r
choose a small directed analytic path P in a neighbourhood of m such that\r
Holp∇1, P q \u007F\u0010 Holp∇2, P q. In other words, χa is an embedding, and hence\r
the terminology generalised connection is justified.\r
6.1.1 Projective structure on A\r
a\r
.\r
On M we will consider the system of connected piecewise analytic graphs.\r
This system is directed under inclusions of graphs. Given a piecewise con\u0002nected analytic graph Γ in M we denote by tǫ1, . . . , ǫnpΓqu the edges and by\r
tv1, . . . , vmpΓqu the vertices. Let PΓ be the set of paths in Γ and define\r
AΓ \u0010 HompPΓ, Gq .\r
An inclusion of graphs Γ1  Γ induces a projection\r
PΓ1 Γ : AΓ Ñ AΓ1 . (64)\r
Since every analytic path is a path in a piecewise analytic graph and vice\r
versa we get\r
A\r
a\r
\u0010 limΓ\u001CÝAΓ,\r
where the projective limit is taken over all piecewise analytic graphs.\r
If we choose an orientation of the edges tǫ1, . . . , ǫnpΓqu we obtain again an\r
identification\r
AΓ \u0014 G\r
npΓq\r
via the map\r
AΓ Q ∇ Ñ p∇pǫ1q, . . . , ∇pǫnpΓqqq P G\r
npΓq\r
.\r
This identification gives rise to various structures on AΓ and therefore also on\r
A\r
a\r
. For example the topological structure given by the topological structure\r
of GnpΓq. Also the projections PΓ1 Γ are continuous and hence give a topological\r
structure on the projective limit, i.e. A\r
a\r
. We note that A is dense in A\r
a\r
, see\r
[22] and references therein.\r
Another structure arising from this identification is the measure or more\r
relevant the Hilbert space structure. Since G is a compact group we can\r
equip GnpΓq\r
uniquely with product Haar measure and define\r
L\r
2\r
pAΓq \u0010 L\r
2\r
pG\r
npΓq\r
q.\r
44

Γ1 Γ\r
: L\r
2\r
pA\r

Γ\r
q Ñ L\r

With this we then define\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q \u0010 limΓÝÑL\r
2\r
pAΓq.\r
which is non-separable.\r
The Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q is the Hilbert space that carries the representa\u0002tion of the Poisson algebra (57) used in Loop Quantum Gravity. It is known\r
as the kinematical Hilbert space.\r
6.1.2 Actions of the diffeomorphism group\r
Since an analytic diffeomorphism of M maps P to P we get an action of the\r
group of analytic diffeomorphisms DiffapMq on A\r
a\r
. On the other hand the\r
group of all diffeomorphisms Diff pMq acts on A but does not extend to an\r
action on A\r
a\r
. There are several different way of completing A depending on\r
the choice of ”lattice”, for example piecewise analytic paths like in the case\r
described above, various kinds of smooth paths, where one gets an action\r
of the full diffeomorphism group. See [35, 36] for results and a thorough\r
discussion. The different completions all contain A but the crucial difference\r
seems to be the size of the symmetry group.\r
6.2 Comparing the spaces A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
So far we have introduced the three spaces A, A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
. A is the space of\r
smooth G-connections and we demonstrated that\r
A ãÑ A\r
\r
, A ãÑ A\r
a\r
,\r
which means that both A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
are spaces of generalised connections.\r
Furthermore, since it is known that A is dense in A\r
a\r
, and since there exist a\r
natural surjection\r
σ : A\r
a Ñ A\r
\r
we know that A, too, is dense in A\r
\r
. To see how the surjection σ works recall\r
that both A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
are spaces of homomorphisms\r
A\r
\r
\u0010 HompP, Gq , A\r
a\r
\u0010 HompPa, Gq , (65)\r
45

and since12 tPu ãÑ tPau then σ is just the corresponding surjection between\r
the spaces (65) of homomorphisms.\r
To be precise we should state that we now think of the space A\r
\r
in terms\r
of an embedding\r
φ : Ki Ñ Ti\r
of the projective system tKiu, and that we therefore identify\r
A\r
\r
\u0010 lim\r
T\u001C\r
AT .\r
In the following we will demonstrate the relationship between and role\r
played by these three spaces of connections.\r
First, it is important to see that the shift from A to a larger space of\r
generalised connections is necessary to equip A with topological and Hilbert\r
space structures. The identification of A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
as pro-manifolds is the key\r
step to obtain this. The space A itself is not a pro-manifold.\r
The key difference between the two spaces A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
is that A\r
a\r
has an\r
action of the (analytic) diffeomorphism group; A\r
\r
does not. Further, the\r
Hilbert space structure associated to the two spaces are respectively non\u0002separable for A\r
a\r
and separable for A\r
\r
. That is, the way A is completed is\r
decisive for how large a symmetry group remains. This shows that there is a\r
direct link between separability of the Hilbert space structure and the action\r
of the diffeomorphism group.\r
The following diagram illustrate the relationship between the three spaces\r
of connections:\r
A\r
a \u001C diffapMq\r
Õ\r
A σ Ó\r
×\r
A\r
\r
\u001C diffp△q\r
where we by diffp△q refer to the discrete symmetries which remain on the\r
infinite triangulation underlying A\r
\r
.\r
It is interesting that the construction of the Dirac-like operator (41) re\u0002quires the shift from A\r
a\r
to A\r
\r
: In [20] the authors attempted to construct\r
such an operator on A\r
a\r
and a corresponding Hilbert space. The attempt\r
was unsuccessful exactly because the number of possible projections (64) is\r
12we assume here that the edges in the triangulations Ti are analytic. This depends on\r
the embedding φ : Ki Ñ Ti but is no real restriction.\r
46

too large to permit a Hilbert space structure carrying a Dirac-like operator\r
similar to (41). The shift from A\r
a\r
to A\r
\r
reduces the type of embeddings\r
between graphs sufficiently. We appear to find the following hierarchy:\r
A : No Hilbert space structure\r
No Dirac-like operator\r
Action of diff(M)\r
A\r
a\r
: Hilbert space structure, non-separable\r
No Dirac-like operator\r
Action of analytic diffeomorphisms\r
A\r
\r
: Hilbert space structure, separable\r
Dirac-like operator\r
Action of diff(△)\r
One way to think of the space A\r
\r
is to see it as the space of (smooth)\r
connections subjected to a sort of gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism group13.\r
Here gauge fixing is meant in the sense that a symmetry group is (partly)\r
removed while the integration at hand still involves the entire space, in this\r
case the space of smooth connections A. In this sense the inner product (46)\r
resembles a functional integral over A ”up to diffeomorphisms”.\r
Another way to think of the space A\r
\r
is to relate it to the construction\r
of the Hilbert space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states in Loop Quan\u0002tum Gravity, see [23]. To do this we first notice that each triangulation in\r
particular is a graph, and we hence get an embedding\r

thus get a map\r

by composing. This map is also going to be a surjection since each graph\r

is not injective because of the symmetries of the triangulated graph.\r
We have the following commutative diagram\r

The amount by which the map Ξ fails to be injective is exactly the symmetry\r
group diffp△q of discrete diffeomorphisms of triangulations. Therefore, we\r
can think of the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pAT q, and thereby also H, as Hilbert spaces\r
of diffeomorphism invariant states up to the discrete group diffp△q. In this\r
picture one should therefore think of a loop associated to a simplicial complex\r
as a kind of equivalence class of smooth loops where the equivalence is with\r
respect to smooth diffeomorphisms.\r
It is interesting that the construction of H relies on a partition of the\r
diffeomorphism group in a ’countable’ and a ’over countable’ part. Here,\r
the countable part is diffp△q. This partition is a compromise between two\r
opposite considerations:\r
• For the Hilbert space H to carry a representation of the loop algebra\r
it must have an action of at least parts of the diffeomorphism group\r
since the loop algebra itself is not diffeomorphism invariant. This re\u0002quirement works to maximise the size of the remaining symmetry group\r
diffp△q.\r
• The construction of a Dirac type operator acting on H requires a strict\r
control over permissible embeddings of the type (16). This requirement\r
works to minimise the size of diffp△q.\r
Therefore, the identification of the symmetry group diffp△q is essential for\r
the construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r
Let us now return to the question regarding the different representa\u0002tions of the Poisson algebras (53) and (55), the representation used in Loop\r
48

Quantum Gravity and the representation contained in the triple pB, D, Hq.\r
We find that the different representations correspond to different choices of\r
holonomy loops in (55). The representation used in Loop Quantum Gravity\r
involves the non separable Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q whereas the representation\r
presented in this paper involves the separable Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q. The\r
central difference between the two representations lies therefore in the corre\u0002sponding symmetry groups. The larger the class of loops is, the larger is the\r
symmetry group.\r
7 Area operators\r
The area operators are an important set of operators in Loop Quantum Grav\u0002ity [24]. It turns out that the area operator also exist within the framework\r
described by the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. These operators are, however,\r
not very natural objects to consider within this framework. However, we find\r
that the square of the Dirac-like operator D has a natural interpretation in\r
terms of a global area-squared operator.\r
7.1 Area operators in Loop Quantum Gravity\r
Classically, the area of a 2-dimensional surface S in Σ is given by\r
ApSq \u0010\r
»\r
S\r
?\r
dFa\u0004 dFa.\r
where the area element dFa was defined in (54). To convert this expression\r
into a form suitable for quantization consider a partition of S into N smaller\r
surfaces Sn such that for any N we have \r
n Sn \u0010 S. Then the area of S can\r
be written\r
ApSq \u0010 lim\r

The point here is that this operator, at the level of a given graph, is well\r
defined. This is due to the fact that the number of intersections of any graph\r
with the surface S is finite. Continued subdivisions of S are obsolete once the\r
resolution is reached where each Sn contains one intersection point. If the\r
area element Sn does not involve an intersection with the graph Γ then the\r
corresponding operator F\r
i\r
Sk\r
vanishes. This means that the surface S has a\r
minimal subdivision into elementary cells Sn each containing one intersection\r
point with the graph. The area operator obtains the form\r

length.\r
7.2 A global area operator\r
The spectral triple pB, D, Hq involves another representation of the oper\u0002ator algebra (57), now based on curves in the inductive system of triangu\u0002lations. Therefore, it is possible to repeat the line of reasoning from Loop\r
Quantum Gravity and define a second area operator, now based on the Dirac\u0002like operator D and the vectors Eˆj\r
i\r
.\r
Recall the interpretation (59) which relates the vectors Eˆj\r
i\r
to the flux\r
operators F\r
j\r
i\r
. This leads to an area operator\r

where F\r
i\r
Sn\r
are as explained in section 5.2.\r
The difference between the operators (68) and (70) lies not in the expres\u0002sion of the operators themselves but rather in the Hilbert spaces on which\r
they act. The former acts on a non-separable Hilbert space whereas the latter\r
acts on the separable Hilbert space H.\r
The area operator (70), however, does not appear to be a natural object\r
in the construction presented here. It involves a surface S which has no\r
natural place in this setting.\r
We can nevertheless apply the line of reasoning from Loop Quantum\r
Gravity to obtain a better understanding of the operator D. Consider again\r
the interpretation of D in terms of conjugate variables of canonical gravity.\r
If we combine equation (62) with equation (69) we obtain\r
D2 \u0010\r
¸\r
i\r
ciApviq\r
2  . . . (71)\r
where, in the limit, the sum runs over all vertices in the inductive system of\r
triangulations tTiu. It is clear that the set of all vertices is a dense set M.\r
Therefore, the sum over all vertices, weighted with the sequence taiu and the\r
a multiplicity factor given by the valency of the vertex, defines an integral\r
over M\r
¸\r

This provides us with a surprising interpretation of D2and thereby of D2\r

manifold M\r

Clearly, the spectrum of ∆ is discrete.\r
8 The spectral action\r
The identification of the operator D2\r
 as a global operator related to the area\r
of the underlying manifold leads us to a new interpretation of the spectral\r
triple pB, D, Hq. In this section we suggest that the operator D2\r
 should be\r
thought of as an action. Subsequently, we point out that the spectral action\r
51

of D resembles a partition function. The argumentation presented in the\r
following is tentative.\r
The first indication that pDq\r
2 may be understood in terms of an action is,\r
as already mentioned, that is has the form of an integral over an underlying\r
manifold.\r
The second indication is directly related to the classical Einstein-Hilbert\r
action. Within the language of Noncommutative Geometry the Einstein\u0002Hilbert action has a natural interpretation as an area of the underlying man\u0002ifold. With the previous section in mind this suggest that the operator pDq\r
2\r
is somehow related to the Einstein-Hilbert action.\r
Let us go into some details. Consider a 4-dimensional, Riemannian spin\u0002geometry described by the real, even spectral triple pA, D, H q where A is a\r
commutative C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra. The Eucledian Einstein-Hilbert action on M can\r
be computed directly from D. It is proportional to the Wodzicki residue of\r
the inverse square of the Dirac operator D [37]. If we denote by T rthe\r
Dixmier trace and define the noncommutative integral \u001F\r
by\r
 \r
f :\u0010 T rf |D|\u00014\r
one has\r
 \r
D\r
2 \u0010\r
\u00011\r
48π\r
2\r
»\r
M\r
R\r
?\r
gd4x ,\r
where dv \u0010\r
?\r
gd4x is the volume form and R is the scalar curvature. It\r
is in this sense that one may interpret the Einstein-Hilbert action as the\r
”two-dimensional measure of a four manifold”, the ”area” of M [38].\r
This resembles the findings of the previous section where we saw that the\r
operator D2\r
 has a natural interpretation in terms of a global area-squared\r
operator over an underlying manifold. If we ignore the obvious issue of ’area’\r
vs. ’area-squared’ one may speculate whether there is some deeper relation\r
between the operator D2\r
 and the Einstein-Hilbert action.\r
These considerations entail an interesting interpretation of the spectral\r
action of D. Consider the quantity\r
T r expp\u0001sD2\r
 q , (73)\r
where s is a real parameter, and let us perform a formal calculation to obtain\r
52

a better understanding of this quantity. We write\r

introduced in section 4. The final\r
expression in (74) may, strictly speaking, not make perfect mathematical\r
sense. However, we know that the initial quantity (73) is well defined. This\r
formal calculations shows that the spectral action (73) has the form of a\r
formal Feynman integral where the expression\r
D\r
2\r
 δ∇\r
plays the role of a classical action.\r
9 Including the sequences tanu as dynamical\r
variables\r
Up till this point we have constructed the spectral triple pB, D, Hq and\r
related it to Quantum Gravity. We have shown that it contains information\r
of the Poisson brackets of canonical gravity and that it partly incorporates\r
diffeomorphism invariance. Two questions remains to be addressed:\r
1. The spectral triple relies on the divergent sequence taiu. What struc\u0002ture does this sequence represent and how do we deal with it?\r
2. How do we incorporate the remaining diffeomorphisms contained in the\r
group diffp△q.\r
One solution to the first question would be to fix the sequence taiu in a\r
manner which counts a partition of an edge with a factor 1\r
2\r
. However, we\r
53

will argue that there may be another solution which is more natural. This\r
section is concerned with this issue.\r
In section 5 we demonstrated that the triple pB, D, Hq has a natural\r
interpretation in terms of Poisson brackets of canonical gravity. In this pic\u0002ture the Dirac type operator D, including the sequence taiu, is a linear sum\r
of the flux operators involving the densitised vielbein operator, see equation\r
(56). This suggest an interpretation of the parameters aiin terms of the\r
determinant of the vielbein\r
ai \u0012 detpe\r
a\r
mq .\r
That the sequence taiu carries metric information also comes out of the\r
discussion in subsection 4.5 where we relate the sequence taiu to the scaling\r
behaviour of the construction.\r
Thirdly, in section 7 we found that the square of D has the form of an\r
integral over the underlying manifold. Here, the measure involved in this\r
integral is given by the sequence taiu.\r
This suggests, as a possible solution to the first question, that we should\r
include the sequence taiu in the construction as dynamical variables. If the\r
sequence taiu has a metric origin, then it seems natural to try to integrate\r
over these degrees of freedom.\r
Therefore we extend the spectral triple pB, D, Hq to include the se\u0002quence taku as dynamical variables. By doing this we obtain a new triple,\r
denoted pBt, Dt, Htq, which is a fibration of triples pB, D, Hq over the space\r
of permissible sequences tak u. It turns out that there is a way to obtain this\r
which leaves the spectral triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq with very few free parameters.\r
This section gives a presentation of ideas and methods used to construct\r
the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq. A detailed account of the construction will be pre\u0002sented elsewhere.\r
To emphasise the dependency on the sequence taiu we shall in the follow\u0002ing write Dpai q instead of D.\r
9.1 The space of permissible sequences taiu\r
We would like to think of the parameters ai as a coordinates in a space H of\r
permissible sequences taiu (that is, sequences that satisfy the condition given\r
by (42)) and to define a Dirac operator on this space. Clearly H  R\r
8\r
. The\r
sequence taiu is characterised by the condition that it diverges sufficiently\r
54

fast. This means that the inverse sequence ta\r
\u00011\r
i\r
u converges towards zero:\r
lim\r
i\r
a\r
\u00011\r
i \u0010 0 sufficiently fast . (75)\r
This convergency condition is easier to work with than condition (42) since\r
convergent sequences can be understood in terms of a Hilbert space structure.\r
Therefore, in a first step we consider L\r
2\r
-sequences. That is, sequences\r
txk u \u0010 px1, . . . , xn, . . .q P R\r
8\r
which satisfy\r
}txku}2\r
:\u0010\r
¸\r
k\r
x\r
2\r
k   8 . (76)\r
The space of sequences satisfying (76) is an infinite dimensional, real, sepa\u0002rable Hilbert space which we also denote H.\r
The exact relationship between vectors txku in H and the sequences taku\r
satisfying condition (42) will be determined in the following.\r
In order to construct a Dirac operator on H we first need a Hilbert space\r
structure over H. The goal is to construct a spectral triple over H.\r
The techniques used to construct L\r
2\r
pH q and the corresponding spectral\r
triple are essentially the same techniques we used to construct the space A\r
\r
and the triple pB, D, Hq. The following is based on ideas by Higson and\r
Kasparov, see [25].\r
The strategy is to consider first finite dimensional subspaces Hn of H,\r
corresponding Hilbert spaces L\r
2\r
pHnq and structure maps\r
P\r
\u0006\r
m,n : L\r
2\r
pHnq Ñ L\r
2\r
pHmq , n ¤ m\r
between Hilbert spaces. Next step is to construct a spectral triple over each\r
space Hn, ensure compatibility with the structure maps P\r
\u0006\r
m,n and finally\r
obtain a triple over H by taking the limit n Ñ 8.\r
There are two potential difficulties with this strategy:\r
• The spaces Hn are non-compact. The construction of the spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq relies strongly on the fact that G is compact. This is a\r
necessary condition to construct the structure maps P\r
\u0006\r
(24) between\r
Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we used the fact that the constant function\r
is square integrable. This is no-longer the case when the underlying\r
space is non-compact.\r
55

• The Dirac type operator, which we aim to construct, will have a non\u0002compact resolvent. This is the same problem we encountered when\r
we constructed the operator D and a problem which will always arise\r
when one constructs a Dirac like operator on an infinite dimensional\r
space (see also [25]). This problem was solved in section 3 by intro\u0002ducing the parameters taiu, whose presence is the very reason why we\r
now wish to construct the extended triple pBt, Dt, Htq. Therefore, it\r
appears that we are in danger of a circular argument: Certainly, we do\r
not wish to introduce yet another infinite sequence to ensure a well be\u0002haved Dirac operator acting on L\r
2\r
pH q entailing yet another extension\r
of pBt\r
, Dt, Htq and so forth.\r
It turns out that there exist a way to construct the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq\r
which avoids these two technical pitfalls.\r
The first problem is related to the fact the canonical map from Hn to Hm\r
is given by ξ Ñ ξ b 1n,m, where 1n,m is the identity function on the m \u0001 n\r
dimensional orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm. However, the function\r
1n,m is not a L\r
2\r
-function and therefore the canonical map is not a map\r
between Hilbert spaces. We can remedy this defect by finding a suitable L\r
2\r
-\r
function φn,m to replace the constant function 1n,m. The choice of function\r
φn,m is restricted by the requirement that it must lie in the kernel of the\r
Dirac type operator, which we wish to construct, when this is restricted to\r
the orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm.\r
The second problem is related to the fact that we are dealing with an\r
infinite dimensional space. To solve this problem we modify the canonical\r
algebra of functions on Hn to include operators which project onto finite\r
dimensional subspaces.\r
9.2 A spectral triple over R8\r
We first consider finite dimensional subspaces Hn \u0010 R\r
n\r
embedded in H by\r
Hn Q px1, . . . , xnq Ñ px1, . . . , xn, 0, . . .q P H .\r
Before we proceed with the construction we introduce some notation and\r
definitions. The Gaussian functions on R\r

φn,mpxn1, . . . , xmq \u0010 φαpxn1q \u0004 . . . \u0004 φαpxmq .\r
This is a square integrable and normalised function on the orthogonal com\u0002plement Hn,m of Hn in Hm.\r
Given a function ξ P L\r

Note that P\r
\u0006\r
n,m defines an embedding of Hilbert spaces. We can therefore\r
define the limit\r
L\r
2\r
pH q :\u0010 limÑL\r
2\r
pHnq ,\r
which is a real, separable Hilbert space over H.\r
Note that, as mentioned in the previous section, the Gauss distributions\r
play the same role in the construction as the constant function did in the\r
construction of H. This solves the first pitfall mentioned above.\r
Since we wish to construct a Dirac type operator we need the Clifford\r
bundle. We define\r
L\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qq :\u0010 limÑL\r
2\r
pHn, ClpHnqq ,\r
where we have used the unital embedding ClpHnq Ñ ClpHmq, n   m.\r
We identify ClpHnq with the exterior product Λ\u0006Hn and define the oper\u0002ators\r
extpeq \u0010 exterior multiplication by e on Λ\u0006Hn ,\r
intpeq \u0010 interior multiplication by e on Λ\u0006Hn ,\r
c\bpeq \u0010 extpeq \b intpeq .\r
which means that c\u0001peq is Clifford multiplication with e and cpeq is Clifford\r
multiplication with e except that e\r
2 \u0010 1 and not e\r
2 \u0010 \u00011. Furthermore, one\r
easily checks that tcpeq, c\u0001pequ \u0010 0.\r

with compact resolvent. It satisfies\r
Dnφ1,npx1, . . . , xnq \u0010 0 .\r
In fact, the kernel of Dn is one dimensional and given by the function\r
φ1,npx1, . . . , xnq. From this we get that\r

As anticipated, the operator D does not have compact resolvent since\r
the group of all finite perturbations of N acts on its spectrum. A possible\r
solution to this problem is to modify the canonical algebra of functions acting\r
on L\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qq. In stead of functions on L\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qq we consider instead\r
functions on finite subspaces of L\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qq and extend these to the full\r
Hilbert space by tensoring them with projection onto Gauss functions. Thus,\r
effectively we include cut-off’s in the algebra. This will ensure that the\r
resolvent of D, understood in terms of an interaction with the algebra, is\r
compact.\r

, a P A , λ R R\r
is a compact operator.\r
Note that the semi-finite trick with the Clifford bundle, which worked\r
for the spaces of connections does not seem to work in this case, since the\r
kernel of D is one dimensional. Therefore there is no symmetry which can\r
be discarded of.\r
9.3 θ-summability\r
We would like to interpret condition (76) in terms of θ-summability of the\r
operator Dpai q . That is, we wish to establish a relation between sequences\r
txiu satisfying (76) and sequences taiu which leave\r
T r exp \r
\u0001D\r
2\r
pai q\r
\b\r
(80)\r
finite. Thus, we seek a function\r
f : R\r
8 Ñ R8\r
which satisfies\r
T r exp \r
\u0001D\r
2\r
pai q\r
\b\r
  8 \u001D f ptaiuq P l\r
2\r
pNq . (81)\r
This emphasis on θ-summability has a clear physical motivation. In sec\u0002tion 8 we noted that the quantity (80) has the form of a path integral. In\r
this light θ-summability simply means that this path integral is finite.\r
9.4 The U p1q-case\r
As a toy example let us consider the U p1q-case and the simplified operator\r
D1\r
pai q on U p1q8\r
which is the limit of operators of the form\r
D\r

9.5 The triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq\r
We are now ready to combine the two spectral triples pB, D, Hq and\r
pA, D, L2pH, ClpH qqq. A point txnu in H gives a θ-summable spectral triple\r
on B via the Dirac operator on H defined by the sequence f\r
\u00011\r
ptxnuq. Let\r
us denote this Dirac operator by Df\u00011ptxnuq . We define the operator Dt acting\r
on\r
Ht:\u0010 L\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qq b H\r
by\r
Dtpξ b ηqptxnuq \u0010\r
Dpξq b ηptxnuq  p\u00011q\r
degpξq\r
ξ b Df\u00011ptxnuqpηqptxnuq , (84)\r
where degpξq means the degree of ξ with respect to the degree in CLpH q.\r
One of the requirement that this defines a semi-finite spectral triple over\r
A b B :\u0010 Bt\r
is that\r
a\r
1  D2\r
t\r
, for all a P Bt\r
,\r
is τ -compact, where τ is a trace defined in (44) tensored with the trace on\r
BpL\r
2\r
pH, ClpH qqq where B denotes the bounded operators.\r
We see that this requirement collide with the following symmetry prop\u0002erty: All a P Bt are from a certain step of the form\r
1 b Pφn,8\r
and therefore the operator\r
a\r
1  D2\r
t\r
is invariant under symmetries permuting all coordinates bigger than n.\r
In order to remedy this we modify the construction of the spectral triple\r
pA, D, L2pH, ClpH qqq slightly. This modification is based on the observation\r
that the parameter α in the Gauss distribution φαpxq is in fact a free pa\u0002rameter. Further, there are an infinite number of these free parameters in\r
the construction of the triple pA, D, L2\r
pH, ClpH qqq, one for each dimension\r
in H. Let us denote these with tαiu. By choosing these parameters carefully\r
we can solve the problem mentioned above.\r
For Dt to have a T r-compact resolvent its eigenvalues must approach\r
infinity. However, for each copy of G we know that its eigenvalues scale with\r
61

pαiq\u00011\r
. Thus, if we require the sequence tαiu to satisfy\r
lim\r
iÑ8\r
αi \u0010 0 ,\r
then the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq may be spectral.\r
Let us pause to comment on this idea. It appears that we have sim\u0002ply exchanged one infinite sequence of free parameters taiu with another\r
infinite sequence tαiu. However, we suggest that the sequence tαiu is not ar\u0002bitrary but should be determined completely from symmetry considerations.\r
The idea is that the αi’s represent an “average background” over which the\r
parameters ai are allowed to fluctuate. Therefore, we suggest to choose a\r
specific sequence tαiu satisfying the following requirements:\r
• Copies of G which correspond to the same level in the projective system\r
of graphs should be assigned the same αi’s.\r
• Given two copies of G where one copy G2 corresponds to a subdivision\r
of the edge associated to the other copy G1, then the corresponding\r
parameters α1, α2 should satisfy\r
α2 \u0010\r
α1\r
2\r
.\r
The first point reflects a rotational symmetry within each graph. The\r
second point is related to the scaling properties of the construction: a division\r
of a line segment corresponds to a factor 1\r
2\r
(see section 4.5 and the discussion\r
of the role of the parameters taiu).\r
To implement this we enumerate the barycentric subdivisions with k and\r
introduce the modified Gauss distributions\r
φkpxq \u0010 pπαkq\r
1{4\r
exp \u0002\r
\u0001x\r
2\r
2αk\r

\r
,\r
where\r
αk \u0010 2\r
\u0001kα . (85)\r
This means that we associate to each edge in the simplicial complexes a\r
parameter αk. In the initial complex each edge is associated the parameter\r
α0 \u0010 α. Edges arising through the first barycentric subdivision are then\r
associated the parameter α1 \u0010 α{2 and so forth.\r
62

Consider now the triple pA, D, L2\r
pH, ClpH qqq constructed with with these\r
new Gauss distributions. This means that the Hilbert space embeddings (77)\r
are modified together with the Bott-Dirac operator (78) which is now of the\r
form\r
Dn \u0010\r
¸\r
N\r
k\u00100\r
¸nk\r
i\u00101\r
\u0002\r
c\u0001peiq\r
B\r
Bxi\r
 cpeiq\r
xi\r
αk\r

\r
,\r
where n \u0010\r
°\r
k nk and where the first sum runs over the number of barycentric\r
subdivisions involved in the graph to which Dn is associated, N being the\r
total number of barycentric subdivisions. The second sum runs over the\r
number of edges within a barycentric subdivision.\r
One now repeats the above construction leading to the operator (84), now\r
with the modified Bott-Dirac operator.\r
The details concerning the spectral properties of the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq\r
will appear elsewhere.\r
10 Distances on A\r
\r
On a Riemannian spin-geometry the Dirac operator D contains the geomet\u0002rical information of the manifold M. In particular, distances can be formu\u0002lated purely algebraically due to Connes [1]. Given two points x, y P M their\r
distance is given by\r
dpx, yq \u0010 sup\r
f PC8pMq\r
 \r
|f pxq \u0001 f pyq| }rD, f s} ¤ 1\r
(\r
. (86)\r
On a Noncommutative Geometry the state space replaces the notion of\r
points. It is possible to extend the notion of distance to the state space\r
by generalising (86).\r
In the present case it is natural to ask whether the Dirac-like operator\r
D introduces a metric structure over the space A\r
\r
and if so, how distances\r
should be interpreted in this setting.\r
The possibility for a distance between smooth connections in A and some\r
closure hereof was first considered in [20]. There, however, the distance\r
between two smooth connections was found to be infinite, since two smooth\r
connections will differ on infinitely many different loops. This entails a finite\r
contribution to the distance from infinitely many copies of G.\r
In the present setting the situation is different due to the sequence taiu.\r
The role of the ai’s is to assign a weight to each copy of G and therefore to\r
63

scale the corresponding distance on G. Therefore, given two points in A\r
\r
their distance\r
dp∇1, ∇2q \u0010 sup\r
aPB\r
 \r
}∇1paq \u0001 ∇2paq} }rD, as} ¤ 1\r
(\r
, ∇1, ∇2 P A\r
\r
, (87)\r
where we choose }\u0004} as the operator norm on matrices in MlpCq, is well defined\r
and finite, even for ∇1, ∇2 P A. This is related to the fact that although our\r
geometry on A\r
\r
is infinite dimensional it assigns A\r
\r
zero volume.\r
The distance (87), when it is applied to smooth connections, is not inde\u0002pendent of the embedding h of simplicial complexes into triangulations.\r
With a metric structure on the space A\r
\r
it is natural to ask which con\u0002nections are ’close’ to each other. Clearly, this depends on the choice of the\r
sequence taiu. However, it is possible to give some general remarks indepen\u0002dently of this choice.\r
Recall that the space A\r
\r
is the limit space limn Gnin an appropriate sense.\r
The distance between ∇1, ∇2 P AKiis simply the sum of geodesic distances\r
on each copy of G, weighted with the appropriate parameters ai. In the\r
previous section we found that the role of the parameters taiu is to scale\r
the different copies of G according to their location in the projective system\r
of simplicial complexes. The larger ai’s corresponds to short distances, now\r
with respect to some manifold. This means that the the distance between\r
∇1 and ∇2 is larger if the connections differ mostly on those copies of G\r
which are assigned small ai’s. Correspondingly, the distance between ∇1 and\r
∇2 is smaller if ∇1 and ∇2 differ mostly on those copies of G which are\r
assigned large ai’s. Therefore, in general, the two generalised connections\r
will be ’close’ to each other if they differ mostly at short scales.\r
Via Levi-Civita connections we can interpret equation (87) as a distance\r
between geometries14. Again we can say that the distance between two ge\u0002ometries depends on the scale on which they differ.\r
Let us consider the Abelian case G \u0010 U p1q and two points ∇1, ∇2 in A\r
\r
.\r
In this case ∇1 and ∇2 are given by sequences of angles tθ\r
1\r
i\r
u and tθ\r
2\r
i\r
u where\r
each angle θ\r
j\r
i\r
corresponds to points expp2πiθ\r
j\r
i\r
q on the i’th copies of U p1q. Let\r
us for simplicity choose a coordinate system on Gnso that θ\r
j\r
i\r
corresponds to\r
the parameter ai. Thus, for example, if we consider G \u0002 G parametrised by\r
angles φ1 and φ2 we choose\r
θ1 \u0010 φ1  φ2 , θ2 \u0010 φ1 \u0001 φ2\r
14In this case, however, the distance formula will be degenerate since different geometries\r
may have identical Levi-Civita connections.\r
64

and so forth. Then the distance between ∇1 and ∇2 reads\r
dp∇1, ∇2q \u0010\r

2\r
k\r
ak2π\r
|θ\r
1\r
k \u0001 θ\r
2\r
k\r
| ,\r
which should be read together with the condition (75).\r
The notion of a distance on a space of connections is not a new one but\r
was discussed already by Feynman [39] and Singer [40]. See also [41] and ref\u0002erences herein. However, these papers all deal with distances between gauge\r
equivalence classes of connections. The construction presented in this paper\r
is quite different from these previous works since two connections which differ\r
by a gauge transformation will, in general, have a non vanishing distance.\r
11 Discussion\r
Before we end this paper we give a few remarks concerning the physical\r
interpretation of the constructions presented.\r
11.1 The quantization scheme\r
As already mentioned, the shift to Ashtekar variables permits a formulation\r
of General Relativity which is close to ordinary Yang-Mills theory. In the\r
Hamilton formulation the theory involves a configuration space of connec\u0002tions corresponding to ordinary SU p2q Yang-Mills theory. The essential dif\u0002ference between General Relativity and Yang-Mills theory lies in the algebra\r
of constraints which encode the symmetries of the theory. For General Rel\u0002ativity the constraints encode diffeomorphism invariance. These constraints\r
are closely related to the foliation of the spacetime M according to\r
Σ \u0002 R Ñ M , (88)\r
where Σ is a 3-dimensional hypersurface. Loosely stated, the constraints\r
encode information about diffeomorphisms within and perpendicular to Σ.\r
Therefore, the key question in any quantization procedure of gravity is the\r
implementation of diffeomorphism invariance in the construction.\r
To quantize a constrained theory there are in general two standard ap\u0002proaches:\r
65

a) To eleminate first, at a classical level, the constraints and thereby find\r
the reduced phase space of the theory. The quantization procedure is\r
applied to the reduced phase space.\r
b) To construct first quantum kinematics for the full phase space by ig\u0002noring the constraints, then construct operators corresponding to the\r
classical constraints and finally solve the quantum constraints to obtain\r
the physical Hilbert space.\r
Loop Quantum Gravity follows the second approach which is due to Dirac\r
(see [42] for a detailed exposition). In section 5.2 we demonstrated that the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq involves a representation of the Poisson algebra\r
(55) of General Relativity. In our interpretation, the construction should\r
be understood as a quantization scheme which lies somewhere between the\r
approaches a) and b).\r
First of all, there is nothing in the geometrical construction that corre\u0002sponds directly to the constraint algebra of General Relativity. However, in\r
section 6 we related the Hilbert space H to the diffeomorphism invariant\r
Hilbert space Hdif f of Loop Quantum Gravity. The difference between H\r
and Hdif f is the group diff(△) of discrete diffeomorphisms on the system of\r
simplicial complexes. Therefore, we think of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq\r
as a geometrical construction describing a quantization procedure of gravity\r
on a Hilbert space which corresponds to a partial solution to the (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism constraint. What remains then, in this picture, is the imple\u0002mentation of the remaining diffeomorphisms encoded in the discrete group\r
diff(△).\r
The second point in which our construction differs from canonical quan\u0002tum gravity is the issue of time. Clearly, a foliation of the manifold is essential\r
for canonical gravity since the Hamilton formulation is based on a choice of\r
an explicit time direction. In contrast to this, the construction presented here\r
does not a priori involve a foliation of space-time. Further, the dimension of\r
the underlying space is completely free. The only restriction is the choice of\r
symmetry group, which, for now, has to be compact15. In particular, we can\r
consider triangulations of a 4-dimensional manifold.\r
These observations suggest two possible interpretations of the construc\u0002tion: First, the construction may be interpreted as a completely covariant\r
construction in four dimensions, involving the full, four-dimensional group\r
15The case G \u0010 SOp1, 3q, for example, is not permitted.\r
66

of diffeomorphisms. This interpretation leaves no room for a foliation and\r
thus no Hamiltonian constraint. Therefore, a dynamical principle replacing\r
the Hamiltonian constraint must be sought elsewhere. This interpretation\r
implies that the group G corresponds to four-dimensional local Lorentz rota\u0002tions. Next, if the loop algebra lives on a four-dimensional manifold, then the\r
interpretation of the Dirac type operator D in terms of canonical quantum\r
gravity must involve a flux operator F\r
a\r
S where S is now a three-dimensional\r
hypersurface. Further, the interaction between D and the algebra of loops\r
should be understood as a four-dimensional operator algebra containing a\r
representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity as a kind of sub\u0002algebra.\r
Alternatively, we may interpret the construction as fundamentally three\u0002dimensional, with G equal to SU p2q. This interpretation does not necessarily\r
mean that we consider a foliation of space-time according to (88). Rather,\r
we would like time to emerge naturally from the construction.\r
Indeed, let us end this discussion with the remark that the philosophy of\r
Noncommutative Geometry is to seek a time within the algebraic construc\u0002tion rather than imposing it a priori. Here we think of the Tomita-Takesaki\r
theory [43] which identifies a one-parameter automorphism group uniquely\r
up to inner automorphisms. It is an interesting question whether this group\r
of modular automorphisms is nontrivial in this or perhaps some similar con\u0002struction. If the answer is in the affirmative, then this might provide us with\r
an alternative to the foliation and thereby with a new dynamical principle.\r
11.2 The group diffp△q and the question of constraints\r
Regardless of how one interprets the spectral triple pB, D, Hq it is clear\r
that one should seek to obtain invariance under the discrete group diffp△q of\r
graph preserving diffeomorphisms.\r
Traditionally, given some space M, invariance under a symmetry group\r
G is obtained by taking the the quotient\r
M {G .\r
However, Noncommutative Geometry gives an alternative approach to quo\u0002tient spaces. A simple example is the space of two points identified. Within\r
Noncommutative Geometry this setup is described via two by two matrices\r
where the off-diagonal entries represent the identification of the points. This\r
67

entails a noncommutative algebra and a structure which, ultimately, leads\r
to the Higgs mechanism in the noncommutative formulation of the Standard\r
Model.\r
In the case of gravity the relevant symmetry group is the diffeomorphism\r
group. This group is probably too large for an application of the noncom\u0002mutative approach. However, in the present setup we have instead the much\r
smaller group diffp△q and one could speculate if the machinery of Noncom\u0002mutative Geometry of quotient spaces could be successfully applied. This\r
idea differs fundamentally from a Dirac-type quantization procedure.\r
Thus, what we suggest is to obtain a formal diffeomorphism invariance\r
by considering the semi-direct product of the loop algebra with the group\r
diffp△q\r
B \u000B diffp△q ,\r
and thereafter building a spectral triple with an associated Hilbert space\r
L\r
2\r
pAq b L\r
2\r
pdiffp△qq. Presumably, such a construction will give rise to addi\u0002tional degrees of freedom through fluctuations around the Dirac type opera\u0002tor.\r
11.3 Background independence\r
In section 6.2 we argued that the space A\r
\r
should be viewed as a space of\r
connections subjected to a gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism group. Naively,\r
it appears that this gauge fixing does not involve any choice of metric or\r
background ’field’ on the manifold. Let us comment on this.\r
The construction in section 2 depends primarily on the initial simplicial\r
complex Ko. The idea is that the basic data entering the construction is the\r
topology of the corresponding manifold. The initial complex gives rise to an\r
initial triangulation To via a homeomorphism\r
h : K Ñ M .\r
This initial triangulation introduces a metric structure on M. The embed\u0002ding A ãÑ A\r
\r
will, of course, depend crucially on the triangulation and in\r
particular on the homeomorphism h. However, the construction and spec\u0002trum of the Dirac-type operator is independent of h and so is its interaction\r
with the algebra and the construction of the Hilbert space. In fact, the no\u0002tion of a manifold may be left out altogether. It is only the identification of\r
A\r
\r
as a space of generalised connections that requires a manifold.\r
68

Another question is the dependency on the sequence taiu. The Dirac\r
type operator D depends crucially on this sequence as does its spectrum.\r
Thus, one may argue that some degree of background dependency enters the\r
construction with the sequence taiu. In section 9 we attempted to free the\r
construction of this dependency by making the ai’s dynamical. The price\r
paid, however, is the introduction of a new sequence tαiu determining the\r
Gauss distributions. Therefore, it seems that the construction, whether we\r
consider the triple pB, D, Hq or the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq, does posses some\r
degree of dependency on a parameter space which one may interpret in terms\r
of a background. The exact nature and implication of this dependency is to\r
be clarified.\r
11.4 Additional degrees of freedom\r
The construction of the triples pB, D, Hq and pBt\r
, Dt, Htq takes canonical\r
quantum gravity as its point of departure. Thus, both spectral triples are a\r
priori of purely gravitational origin. However, there are several indications\r
that the framework presented in this paper contains additional degrees of\r
freedom, both bosonic and fermionic.\r
First, recall that the framework of Noncommutative Geometry generally\r
involves fermionic degrees of freedom since it involves a Dirac type operator\r
acting on a Hilbert space16. The ’fermions’ involved in the spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq are clearly very different from the fermions of the Standard\r
Model since they live on a space of connections. However, this space of con\u0002nections is of course linked to an underlying manifold. A classical limit will\r
presumable involve some kind of delta function on the space of connections\r
(see next section for a discussion hereof) and therefore leave only space-time\r
degrees of freedom for the fermions. Therefore the interesting question is\r
what structures may emerge from these ’fermions’ in a classical limit.\r
Furthermore, during the construction of the the triple pB, D, Hq we\r
found that the CAR algebra emerged in an almost canonical fashion. It\r
seems plausible that almost any construction of a Dirac type operator on\r
an infinite dimensional space will naturally entail an infinite dimensional\r
Clifford bundle which, in turn, leads to the CAR algebra. Thus, it seems\r
that Noncommutative Geometry provides us with a mechanism which equips\r
16For a commutative algebra the underlying space is a Riemannian geometry and the\r
Dirac operator acts on a Hilbert space of spinors. In the noncommutative formulation of\r
the Standard Model the Hilbert space is labelled by the fermions in the Standard Model.\r
69

a purely gravitational setting, the construction of a Dirac type operator on\r
an infinite dimensional space of field configurations, with basic elements of\r
fermionic Quantum Field Theory. In section 4.1 we found that the Hilbert\r
space H factorizes into\r
H \u0010 H,b b H,f ,\r
where the CAR algebra acts on H,f . This shows that H naturally involves\r
both bosonic and fermionic sectors.\r
Finally, let us consider the possibility that the noncommutativity of the\r
loop algebra will generate an additional bosonic sector through the inner\r
automorphisms of the algebra. To explain this consider first a classical finite\u0002dimensional, real spectral triple pA, D, H q. A noncommutative algebra A\r
contains inner automorphisms of the form\r
αupxq \u0010 uxu\u0006\r
\bx P A ,\r
where u is an arbitrary element of the unitary group, uu\u0006 \u0010 u\r
\u0006\r
u \u0010 1. A\r
change of representation of the algebra A from π to π \u0005 α\r
\u00011\r
u\r
is equivalent to\r
the replacement of the Dirac operator D by\r
D˜ \u0010 D  A\r
1\r
 JA1\r
J\r
\u00011\r
, (89)\r
where A1 \u0010 urD, u\u0006s is a noncommutative one-form, and where J is a real\r
structure. In the noncommutative formulation of the Standard Model cou\u0002pled to gravity [2] the entire bosonic sector of the Standard Model, including\r
the Higgs boson, is generated by this type of fluctuations of the Dirac oper\u0002ator by a general one-form A1 \u0010\r
°\r
airD, bis with ai, bi P A.\r
This mechanism is general. The interesting question is what kind of\r
bosonic sector the inner automorphisms of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq\r
will generate.\r
The general idea behind these remarks is that pure Quantum Gravity may,\r
as a ”free” spin-off, contain matter degrees of freedom. Thus, we believe\r
that one should not attempt to couple matter degrees of freedom to the\r
construction presented in this paper but rather hope to see matter emerge\r
dynamically.\r

12 Conclusion and outlook\r
In this paper we establish a link between the mathematics of Noncommu\u0002tative Geometry and the field of canonical quantum gravity. We construct\r
a spectral triple pB, D, Hq over a space of connections and show that the\r
Poisson structure of General Relativity, formulated in terms of loop variables,\r
is encoded in the interaction between the Dirac type operator D and the\r
loop algebra B. The Hilbert space H corresponds to a partial solution of\r
the diffeomorphism constraint of canonical gravity. The inner product of H\r
involves a functional integral over a space of connections and the Dirac type\r
operator D has the form of a global functional derivation. Consequently, we\r
interpret the triple in terms of a non-perturbative, background independent,\r
quantum field theory.\r
The construction is based on a projective system of simplicial complexes.\r
The simplicial complexes are related through repeated barycentric subdivi\u0002sions. The triple pB, D, Hq is the limit of spectral triples formulated at\r
the level of finite simplicial complexes. Since the operation of barycentric\r
subdivision is countable the limit triple is separable and spectral.\r
The square of the Dirac type operator has, in terms of canonical quan\u0002tum gravity, a natural interpretation as global operator related to the area\r
operators known in Loop Quantum Gravity. We interpret the operator pDq\r
2\r
in terms of an action and show that the spectral action of D has the form\r
of a Feynman path integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an\r
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.\r
The construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq differs from a tradi\u0002tional canonical quantization procedure of General Relativity in the way the\r
group of diffeomorphisms is treated. Rather than encoding the symmetries\r
of the classical theory in a set of constraints the construction works directly\r
on a Hilbert space H which corresponds to a partial solution of the (spa\u0002tial) diffeomorphism constraint. The existence of the spectral triple relies\r
on a particular split of the diffeomorphism group into a countable and an\r
over-countable part. The over-countable part is discarded of; the group of\r
countable diffeomorphisms is the group diffp△q of diffeomorphisms between\r
simplicial complexes. This means that the Poisson algebra of General Rela\u0002tivity is represented on the separable Hilbert space H.\r
71

The Dirac type operator D depends on an infinite sequence of parameters\r
taiu. These parameters determine the scaling behaviour of the construction.\r
We believe that a correct understanding and treatment of these parameters\r
is essential. In this paper we propose a possible way to treat the sequence\r
taiu. Since the sequence is seen to have metric origin we propose to include\r
it as a dynamical variable in the construction. This leads to a new triple,\r
denoted pBt\r
, Dt, Htq, which includes the spectral triple pB, D, Hq as well\r
as a sector permitting the sequence taiu to vary. The triple pBt, Dt, Htq is\r
constructed to ensure that the operator D is θ-summable. Thus, we permit\r
only sequences taiu which leaves the spectral action of D finite.\r
Furthermore, the Dirac type operator D defines a distance on the un\u0002derlying space of connections. Clearly, this distance depends strongly on the\r
sequence taiu. However, we find that a general feature of this distance func\u0002tion is that two connections are ”close” if they differ mostly at short scales.\r
It is possible to read this paper in a more conservative way, discarding the\r
role of Noncommutative Geometry and reading it as a reformulation of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity. If we ignore the construction of the Dirac type operator\r
D and focus instead on the algebra B and the Hilbert space H, with\u0002out the Clifford bundle, and consider the algebra of the vectors Eˆi\r
j\r
, then, as\r
already mentioned, we obtain a representation of the Poisson algebra of Gen\u0002eral Relativity on a separable Hilbert space. Therefore, this Hilbert space, let\r
us denote it H1\r
, replaces the otherwise non-separable Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q\r
known as the kinematical Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity. In Loop\r
Quantum Gravity the kinematical Hilbert space is the Hilbert space on which\r
the constraints of General Relativity are defined. Thus, one could formulate\r
the complete set of constraints of General Relativity in terms of operators\r
acting on the Hilbert space H1\r
. First, as explained in section 6, the Hilbert\r
space H1\r
 has an action of the reduced set of diffeomorphisms diffp△q. There\u0002fore the spatial diffeomorphism constraint should be formulated in terms of\r
the group diffp△q. Next, one may likewise formulate the Gauss and Hamil\u0002tonian constraints of Loop Quantum Gravity on H1\r
. The central message\r
here is that it is possible to formulate Loop Quantum Gravity in terms of\r
a separable kinematical Hilbert space. It is an interesting question whether\r
this observation will have an impact on any of the challenges facing Loop\r
Quantum Gravity.\r
72

Let us finally remind the reader that the focus of this paper is the physi\u0002cal significance of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. The detailed mathematical\r
analysis of the triple is given in [22].\r
Outlook\r
More analysis is needed to understand the physical and mathematical\r
significance of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. First of all it is imperative\r
to understand the role and proper treatment of the sequence taiu since this\r
sequence is central to the existence of the triple. Let us here just say that\r
the sequence taiu should be understood in connection with the group of\r
diffeomorphisms diffp△q since elements hereof are given by rearrangement of\r
the parameters ai. Having said this, let us list other issues which we think\r
deserves attention.\r
- First, we have seen that the spectral action resembles a Feynman path\r
integral. We believe that the computation and analysis of the spectral\r
action is the most interesting task to address at the present stage of the\r
project. Here one should consider the Dirac operator which involves\r
the inner fluctuations described in section 11.\r
- A prime issue for any theory or framework for non-perturbative Quan\u0002tum Gravity is the formulation of a semi-classical limit. In the present\r
case the aim is to obtain a classical limit which involves not only a\r
smooth geometry - characterised by a commutative \u0006-algebra - but to\r
obtain a limit which includes an additional matrix factor of the type\r
that characterises the almost commutative algebra in Connes’ formula\u0002tion of the Standard Model. Indeed, since Connes’ geometrical realiza\u0002tion of the Standard Model is so attractive and powerful as it stands,\r
it remains to understand why the algebra which lies at the heart of\r
this formulation should have this particular noncommutativity. We\r
suggest that the source of this noncommutativity lies in pure Quan\u0002tum Gravity. Recall that the loop algebra B is essentially an almost\r
commutative algebra over the space A of connections. That is, it is\r
a product of smooth functions over A and a matrix factor MlpCq. If\r
we think of a classical limit as the emergence of a single geometry it\r
seems reasonable to expect something close to a delta function peaked\r
around a connection ∇. However, when we apply the loop algebra on a\r
73

delta function it reduces to the matrix factor MlpCq or some subalgebra\r
hereof. Furthermore, if we keep in mind that the construction of the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq involves a choice of a basepoint17, then it\r
seems possible that a similar construction which does not involve this\r
basepoint will entail a smearing of the matrix factor over the manifold.\r
Thus, we speculate that the matrix factor behind the noncommutative\r
formulation of the Standard Model emerges in the classical limit from\r
the noncommutative algebra of holonomy loops.\r
We suspect this issue to be related to the calculation of the spectral\r
action. However, one should also investigate whether ideas from Loop\r
Quantum Gravity concerning coherent states [44] can be applied.\r
- The question about time is fundamental to any general covariant theory\r
since such theories have no preferred time flow. This situation is even\r
more complicated when one attempts to include quantum theory since\r
this will presumable lead to a theory which involves some notion of\r
superpositions of geometries and thus does not permit any notion of\r
a predetermined time. A possible solution to this problem has been\r
proposed by Connes (see for example [38]. See also [45] for similar\r
ideas developed by Connes and Rovelli). The idea is that the concept\r
of time is intimately linked to the noncommutativity of the algebra\r
of observables of Quantum Gravity. Specifically, it is a fundamental\r
property of von Neumann algebras that they possess a 1-parameter\r
family of automorphisms which is unique up to inner automorphisms.\r
Thus, the idea is that this group of automorphisms, the modular group,\r
should be understood in terms of a time. It is therefore natural to ask\r
whether the noncommutative \u0006-algebras introduced in this paper give\r
rise to a nontrivial modular group and whether this can be interpreted\r
as a time flow.\r
Alternatively, one might try to exploit the fact that the construction\r
presented in this paper is basically quantum mechanics on the group\r
G taken infinitely many times. Here, each copy of G corresponds to a\r
degree of freedom originating somewhere on the underlying manifold.\r
Thus, one could consider the time evolution, with respect to one copy\r
of G, given by the operator exppi∆tq where ∆ is the Laplace operator.\r
17See appendix A for an extension of the triple pB, D, Hq which avoids this choice of\r
basepoint.\r
74

This suggest that the unitary operator\r
U ptq :\u0010 exppipDq\r
2\r
tq\r
may be thought of as a time evolution operator.\r
- The construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq starts with a sim\u0002plicial complex. It is an important question to determine the exact\r
dependency of the triple on the choice of initial complex. For instance,\r
consider two simplicial complexes K1 and K2 chosen so that their union\r
is the barycentric subdivision of yet another simplicial complex K3.\r
Does the construction depend on whether one chooses K3 or the union\r
of K1 and K2 as the initial complex? The answer is, a priori, yes, since\r
the two choices will come with different sequences of parameters taiu.\r
The exact nature of this dependency needs to be clarified. Clearly, the\r
idea is that the spectral triple should depend only on topological data\r
coming from the underlying manifold. A related issue is the merging\r
of different spectral triples based on different simplicial complexes. By\r
gluing complexes it should be possible to move from one topological\r
setting to another. These issues are all connected with the sequence\r
taiu and the group of diffeomorphisms in diffp△q.\r
- A related issue is the possibility to obtain a similar construction based\r
on a different projective system of graphs. The choice of simplicial com\u0002plexes (or, triangulations) and barycentric subdivisions seems natural\r
but is not compulsory. In [22] we provide certain necessary require\u0002ments for a system of graphs to be suitable for the construction of a\r
spectral triple. These requirements leave room for projective systems\r
of graphs which are not simplicial complexes. Again, more analysis is\r
needed to determine the dependency of the final construction on dif\u0002ferent choices of graphs. It is clear that a projective system of graphs\r
must be countable in order to permit the construction of a spectral\r
triple.\r
- It is desirable to be able to deal also with a non-compact gauge group\r
such as SOp3, 1q. At present, the compactness of the gauge group is\r
essential for the construction of the Hilbert space to work. Basically,\r
we need the identity to be an L\r
2\r
-function with respect to the Haar\r
measure. One could speculate whether the techniques of Higson and\r
75

Kasparov [25] might be applied to resolve this issue. Here, the trick is\r
to use a Dirac operator with a nontrivial square-integrable kernel and\r
to define embeddings between Hilbert spaces via this kernel.\r
- One should further clarify the relation between the construction pre\u0002sented here and Loop Quantum Gravity. In particular, it would be\r
interesting to understand if there is a relation between the operator D\r
and the Hamilton constraint. Here one should most likely consider the\r
fluctuated version of D, with respect to inner automorphisms, since\r
this operator involves also the loop algebra.\r
- It is an interesting question whether the construction presented in this\r
paper has anything to say about nonperturbative gauge theory. Con\u0002sider a single line segment and the sequence an \u0010 a02\r
n\r
, where n cor\u0002responds to the number of subdivisions of the segment. This is a nat\u0002ural sequence to consider but we know that the asymptotic behaviour\r
an \u0012 2\r
n\r
is too weak for the Dirac type operator to have a compact\r
resolvent. If we consider instead the sequence an \u0010 a0p2  |ǫ|qnthen\r
D will have a compact resolvent as long as ǫ is non-zero. This setup is\r
then extended to all line segments in the projective system of graphs.\r
As long as ǫ is non-zero the corresponding spectral action of D is well\r
defined and resembles a Feynman path integral over a space of connec\u0002tions. The interesting question is what theory this object represents. It\r
seems clear that it should be understood as a non-perturbative Quan\u0002tum Field Theory involving a gauge field. The setup resembles lattice\r
gauge theory with the crucial difference that a lattice spacing is ab\u0002sent and that one does not have the freedom to choose an action. It\r
would be interesting to calculate the spectral action and, subsequently,\r
to take the limit ǫ Ñ 0. Presumably, this limit will lead to divergences\r
since the operator D ceases to have compact resolvent when ǫ \u0010 0.\r
One can speculate whether these divergences might correspond to the\r
divergences found in perturbative Quantum Field Theory.\r
- Of course, the exact construction and analysis of the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq\r
should be carried out. A publication with these details is under prepa\u0002ration.\r

A A spectral triple without the basepoint\r
The diffeomorphism invariance obtained so far only includes diffeomorphisms\r
which preserve the basepoint introduced in section 2. The role of the base\u0002point is to equip the algebra of loops with a product. Because the choice of\r
basepoint partly breaks diffeomorphism invariance we would like to obtain\r
a structure which avoids the basepoint. It turns out that such a construc\u0002tion does exist. Instead of the group structure of loops this more general\r
construction is based on a groupoid structure of path.\r
Once again we start with an abstract simplicial complex K with vertices\r
tviu and edges tǫj u. Consider the Hilbert space\r
HK \u0010 L\r
2\r
ptviu \u0002 AK, MlpCqq ,\r
where we recall that AK \u0010 GnpKq. For now we omit the Clifford bundle which\r
is not necessary for the construction and representation of the algebra.\r
In fact, there are two natural algebras to consider. Denote by Ω the set of\r
loops in K with arbitrary basepoint and consider first the algebra generated\r
by these loops equipped with the product\r
fL1\r
\u0004 fL2 \u0010\r
"\r
0 if basepoints differ\r
fL1 \u0004L2if basepoints coincide.\r
77

Again we can construct a norm via the matrix norm on G and we obtain a\r
C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra which we denote BΩ.\r
The second option, which is perhaps more natural, is to consider paths in\r
K. Denote by P the set of paths in K and denote by BP the algebra generated\r
by such paths with a natural product. Clearly, BΩ ãÑ BP . Concretely, we\r
let the algebra BP be given by its representation which is as follows. Given\r
a path p that starts in v1 and ends in v2 we write\r
pfp \u0004 ξqpvj, ∇q \u0010\r
"\r
0 if vj\u007F\u0010 v2\r
∇ppq \u0004 ξpv1, ∇q if vj \u0010 v2 ,\r
where ∇ppq is defined as in (11), just with a path instead of a loop.\r
In this setup a path can now be seen as an operator which combines the\r
holonomy along the path with a matrix structure\r
|vmyxvn|\r
and we notice that loops with arbitrary basepoint are found on the diagonal\r
of this matrix structure. Thus, a natural trace will pick out all the loops and\r
thereby, in terms of holonomy loops, the gauge covariant elements.\r
The inner product on the Hilbert space HK also involves a sum over\r
vertices. The rest of the construction can be carried out in a similar manner\r
to the construction of the triple pB, D, Hq.\r
This formulation seems better suitable for a semi-classical limit since it\r
involves the points of the manifold, which, presumable, should emerge in\r
such a limit.\r
B On diffeomorphism invariance\r
Although the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q does not have an action of the full dif\u0002feomorphism group it is possible to introduce a notion of analytic diffeomor\u0002phisms on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q via the space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q. This, in turn, allows us to extend\r
the action of certain operators on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q to the larger Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q\r
and thereby introduce a notion of (analytic) diffeomorphism invariance for\r
these operators. This setup involves an embedding of general piecewise ana\u0002lytic graphs Γ into triangulations Ti coming from the projective system tKiu.\r
Therefore, the action of these operators on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q will depend on a choice\r
of embedding. It is important to realize that this construction does not work\r
78

for the operator D since we do not have a Clifford bundle over the space\r
L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q.\r
The following should be read as a rough idea or strategy as to how one\r
introduces a notion of diffeomorphism invariance on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q, rather than a\r
complete analysis.\r
Let us go into details. Given an element ξΓ P L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q associated to a\r
piece-wise analytic graph Γ we choose an embedding of a suitable simplicial\r
complex Ki\r
φ : Ki Ñ Ti\r
,\r
where Tiis a triangulation in M, so that Γ lies in Ti. Consider an operator\r
O on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q. This could for example be the Laplace operator. The action\r
of O on ξΓ is defined as\r
OpξΓq :\u0010 φpOpφ\r
\u00011\r
ξΓqq .\r
If we map d : ξΓ Ñ ξdpΓq with a diffeomorphism d then the action of O\r
changes accordingly\r
OpξdpΓqq :\u0010 φ\r
1\r
pOppφ\r
1\r
q\u00011ξΓqq ,\r
where φ\r
1\r
is a new embedding. We obtain the diagram\r
ξΓ\r

(90)\r
where d and d\r
1\r
 belong to diffp△q. To have a diffeomorphism invariant\r
state means that the state is invariant under diffp△q. This is exactly the\r
space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states mentioned in the previous\r
subsection. A diffeomorphism invariant operator O is an operator for which\r
the centre part of the diagram (90) commute\r

This reflects the simple observation that a loop is, by itself, not an observable\r
since it is not self-adjoint. Only the combination L  L\r
\u00011\r
is self-adjoint,\r
exactly because it is invariant with respect to the symmetry group of the\r
loop.\r
79

C Symmetric states\r
In Quantum Field Theory the vacuum state is defined as the unique trans\u0002lational invariant state. In the present setting there are certain states which\r
display a high degree of symmetry and which may be thought in terms of a\r
ground state.\r
Consider first the spectral triple pB, D, Hq and the two states\r
ψ0p∇q \u0010 ψ0pg1, g2, . . . , gn, . . .q \u0010 δG1\r
pidq \u0004 δG2pidq \u0004 . . . \u0004 δGnpidq \u0004 . . . ,\r
and\r
φ0p∇q \u0010 1 .\r
Here δGnis the delta-function on the n’th copy of G and c is a constant. The\r
action of a loop L on the first state reads\r
fL \u0004 ψ0p∇q \u0010 ψ0p∇q\r
for any L in B. This means that the entire algebra B collapses into the\r
identity on the state ψ0. This corresponds to flat space. This state, however,\r
does not lie in the Hilbert space, nor in the domain of the operator D. In\r
contrast to this the state φ0 lies in the kernel of D. Both states ψ0 are\r
invariant under diffp△q since they are invariant under any permutation of\r
the argument pg1, . . . , gn, . . .q.\r
If we consider instead the spectral triple pBt, Dt, Htq there are again two\r
states which are highly symmetric. Consider first\r
Ht Q Ψ0p∇, x¯q \u0010 ψ0p∇q b ξopx¯q ,\r
where\r
ξ0px¯q \u0010 ξ0px1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .q \u0010 δx1\r
pα1q \u0004 δx2pα2q \u0004 . . . \u0004 δxnpαnq \u0004 . . .\r
This state fixes the sequence taiu on the ’background’ sequence tαiu which\r
was, in section 9.5, fixed according to relation (85). Again, this states does\r
not lie in the domain of the Dirac operator Dt. Notice however, that by\r
choosing the parameters ai’s according to relation (85) one obtains a Dirac\r
type operator D which is, up to an overall factor, invariant under a shift in\r
the parameters ai. Such a shift corresponds to a change of scale.\r
Next, we may also consider the state\r
Ht Q Φ0p∇, x¯q \u0010 φ0p∇q b ηopx¯q ,\r
80

where\r
η0px¯q \u0010 φ1px1q \u0004 φ2px2q \u0004 . . . \u0004 φnpxnq \u0004 . . .\r
Here φnpxnq is the Gauss distribution which we used to construct the triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq. Since the state η0 lies in the kernel of Da the state Φ0 lies in\r
the kernel of Dt.\r

Abstract\r
This paper establishes a link between Noncommutative Geometry\r
and canonical quantum gravity. A semi-finite spectral triple over a\r
space of connections is presented. The triple involves an algebra of\r
holonomy loops and a Dirac type operator which resembles a global\r
functional derivation operator. The interaction between the Dirac op\u0002erator and the algebra reproduces the Poisson structure of General\r
Relativity. Moreover, the associated Hilbert space corresponds, up to\r
a discrete symmetry group, to the Hilbert space of diffeomorphism in\u0002variant states known from Loop Quantum Gravity. Correspondingly,\r
the square of the Dirac operator has, in terms of canonical quantum\r
gravity, the form of a global area-squared operator. Furthermore, the\r
spectral action resembles a partition function of Quantum Gravity.\r
The construction is background independent and is based on an in\u0002ductive system of triangulations. This paper is the first of two papers\r
on the subject.\r

Ever since the discovery of the Standard Model of Particle Physics physicists\r
have worked to understand the apparently arbitrary structure of this the\u0002ory. Natures choice of gauge group, the Higgs sector, the 20-30 apparently\r
unrelated parameters etc. almost begs for a deeper explanation.\r
With the pioneering work of Alain Connes and co-workers on the Standard\r
Model [1]-[8] such an explanation now appears to emerge. In Connes’ work\r
the Standard Model coupled to General Relativity is expressed as a single\r
gravitational theory. The language used for this unification is Noncommu\u0002tative Geometry [1]. Within this framework, and under a few mathematical\r
assumptions, the Standard Model coupled to gravity can be shown to be\r
almost unique [7, 8].\r
Noncommutative Geometry is based on the result [1, 9] that Riemannian\r
spin geometry has an equivalent formulation in terms of commutative \u0006-\r
3

algebras and Dirac operators. In this formulation it is the Dirac operator that\r
carries metric information of the underlying manifold which is now written\r
as the spectrum of the \u0006-algebra. In total, a Riemannian spin geometry can\r
be described in terms of a spectral triple which is the collection pB, H, Dq of\r
the algebra B, the Dirac operator D and the Hilbert space H which carries\r
a representation and action of B and D. To obtain equivalence the triple is\r
required to satisfy a set of axioms of Noncommutative Geometry.\r
The language of spectral triples has a natural generalisation which in\u0002cludes also noncommutative \u0006-algebras and corresponding Dirac type opera\u0002tors. It is this generalisation which leads to the aforementioned formulation\r
of the Standard Model. It turns out that the classical action of the Standard\r
Model coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action emerges from a spectral action\r
principle applied to a specific spectral triple [3, 4, 5]. This triple involves\r
an almost commutative \u0006-algebra which is an algebra that factorises into a\r
commutative part times a matrix factor. This means that the classical action\r
describing all fundamental physics4emerges from an asymptotic expansion\r
of the spectral action\r
TrφpD˜ {λq \u0010\r
¸\r
λ\r
n\r
cn .\r
Here D˜ denotes the Dirac type operator D subjected to certain inner fluc\u0002tuations stemming from the noncommutativity of the algebra. Without the\r
matrix factor, that is, for a commutative \u0006-algebra, the same expression leads\r
to the Einstein-Hilbert action alone. Thus, it is the inclusion of noncommuta\u0002tive \u0006-algebras in the language of spectral triples that permits the formulation\r
of all fundamental forces and particles in terms of pure gravity.\r
This success of Noncommutative Geometry as a framework to describe\r
fundamental physics in a unified manner raises, however, a fundamental ques\u0002tion regarding quantization. The Standard Model by itself is a quantum\r
field theory. However, in its noncommutative formulation it arises as an\r
integrated part of a purely gravitational theory. This theory is essentially\r
classical. Quantum Field Theory enters the construction in a secondary step\r
where the spectral action has been expanded in a gravitational sector involv\u0002ing only the metric field and a matter sector including all the fermionic and\r
bosonic fields of the Standard Model. Quantization is applied to the latter\r
sector only.\r
So this is the question: how does the quantization procedure of Quantum\r
Field Theory fit into the language of Noncommutative Geometry? Since the\r
4Here we give the bosonic part only.\r
4

structure of the Standard Model is so readily translated into the language of\r
Noncommutative Geometry one would expect also Quantum Field Theory to\r
have a corresponding translation. This question is further complicated by the\r
intrinsic gravitational nature of Connes’ formulation of the Standard Model.\r
If a notion of quantization does exist within this framework one would expect\r
this to involve, at some level, Quantum Gravity.\r
This paper is motivated by these considerations. We wish to address the\r
question regarding the inclusion of the quantization procedure in the general\r
framework of Noncommutative Geometry and, in particular, in the noncom\u0002mutative formulation of the Standard Model. We start the investigation with\r
the assumption that the answer will involve some notion of Quantum Grav\u0002ity. Thus, to guide our intuition we consult first canonical quantum gravity\r
and one of its modern trends known as Loop Quantum Gravity [11]-[15].\r
Loop Quantum Gravity is an approach to non-perturbative Quantum\r
Gravity which is based on a formulation of General Relativity in terms of\r
Ashtekar variables [16, 17]. These variables include the Ashtekar connection\r
and its conjugate variable, the inverse densitised dreibein. In Loop Quantum\r
Gravity one takes as the classical phase space variables the holonomy loop\r
of the Ashtekar connection and its conjugate, a certain flux vector. These\r
variables are then used in a Dirac-type quantization procedure. This involves\r
the representation of the corresponding Poisson structure on a kinematical\r
Hilbert space as well as the formulation of constraints encoding the sym\u0002metries of the classical theory. Here, the holonomy loops are represented\r
as multiplication operators. This means that the kinematical Hilbert space\r
involves functions over a space of connections.\r
On a technical level, Loop Quantum Gravity exploits the holonomy\u0002formulation of gravity to recast the problem of quantizing gravity in terms\r
of a inductive system of graphs. It turns out that the space of connections,\r
when seen in terms of holonomies restricted to a specific graph, is a mani\u0002fold. This manifold is related to the gauge group which, in the case of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity, is SU p2q. This means that the space of connections itself\r
is a pro-manifold, the projective limit of manifolds. This, in turn, permits a\r
formulation of the quantization procedure on the level of finite graphs whose\r
complexity are subsequently increased infinitely. This construction is due to\r
Ashtekar and Lewandowski [18, 19].\r
In this paper we aim to construct a model which involves elements of\r
both Noncommutative Geometry and Quantum Gravity. We use two central\r
elements of Loop Quantum Gravity to obtain such a model. First, the fact\r
5

that gravity can be formulated in terms of Wilson loops leads us to consider\r
a spectral triple which involves an algebra of holonomy loops. These loop\r
variables serve as functions on an underlying space of connections. Second,\r
we wish to exploit the pro-manifold structure of the space of connections to\r
describe the algebra of loops and to construct a Dirac type operator on the\r
space of connections. This means that we aim to construct a spectral triple\r
over each manifold associated to graphs in the projective system. These\r
spectral triples are required to be compatible with all embeddings between\r
graphs. This requirement will ensure that the limit where the complexity of\r
graphs is increased infinitely gives rise to a limit spectral triple.\r
This program was initiated first in [20] (see also [21]) where the authors\r
attempted to construct such a spectral triple. There the authors found that\r
the inductive system of graphs used in Loop Quantum Gravity, which is the\r
system of all piecewise analytic graphs, is too large to permit a Dirac type\r
operator on the space of connections. Technically, the multitude of possible\r
embedding of different graphs was found to be too large for a Dirac type\r
operator compatible with all embeddings to exist.\r
In the present paper we return to this problem to consider now different\r
systems of embedded graphs. In particular, we study the countable system of\r
embedded graphs given by a triangulation and its barycentric subdivisions.\r
It turns out that this restricted system of graphs does permit a Dirac type\r
operator on the associated projective system of manifolds. Furthermore, we\r
find that the limit of infinitely many barycentric subdivisions gives us an\r
accurate description of the full space of connections as well as the associated\r
algebra of holonomy loops. The construction is general and only assumes the\r
gauge group G to be compact.\r
What we obtain is the following. Given a triangulation T and a compact\r
Lie group G, we construct a spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq , (1)\r
where B is the \u0006-algebra of holonomy loops obtained via the inductive system\r
of triangulations. The algebra is represented on the separable Hilbert space\r
H which carries an action of the Dirac type operator D. If we denote by A\r
the space of smooth connections in a trivial principal bundle M \u0002 G, where\r
M is a manifold which corresponds to the triangulation T , then we find\r
that A is densely contained in the pro-manifold associated to the algebra B.\r
This means that the spectral triple (1) is a geometrical construction over the\r
space of connections.\r
6

The construction of the spectral triple (1) depends, as mentioned, cru\u0002cially on the choice of graphs. This choice is closely related to the group\r
of diffeomorphisms acting on the Hilbert space H. We find that the choice\r
of a restricted system of graphs amounts to a type of gauge fixing of the\r
diffeomorphism group. Thus, the Hilbert space H does not carry an action\r
of any smooth diffeomorphisms. Rather, it carries an action of a discrete\r
group of diffeomorphisms associated to the inductive system of graphs. This\r
means that the construction reduces the diffeomorphism group to a countable\r
group.\r
The spectral triple (1) has a clear interpretation in terms of a non\u0002perturbative, background independent Quantum Field Theory related to\r
gravity. First of all, since the triple exists over a space of connections the\r
Dirac type operator D should be interpreted as a global functional deriva\u0002tion operator. Also, the Hilbert space H has an inner product which involves\r
a functional integral. Next, we find that the interaction between the Dirac\r
type operator D and the loop algebra B reproduces the Poisson structure\r
of General Relativity. Furthermore, the Hilbert space H is found to be\r
directly related to the Hilbert space of (spatial) diffeomorphism invariant\r
states known from Loop Quantum Gravity [23]. The difference between the\r
two is given by the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H. Thus, we\r
interpret the Hilbert space H in terms of a partial solution to the (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism constraint.\r
The square of the Dirac type operator D has the form of an integral over\r
the underlying manifold M. The integrand is a quantity which, in terms of\r
canonical quantum gravity, has an interpretation as an area-squared density\r
operator. This operator resembles the area operators known in Loop Quan\u0002tum Gravity [24]. Furthermore, we suggest that pDq\r
2\r
should be interpreted\r
in terms of an action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D the form\r
of a Feynman integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an\r
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.\r
It is important to realize that the construction works in any dimension\r
and does not require a foliation of the underlying manifold.\r
The construction of the Dirac type operator D involves an infinite di\u0002mensional Clifford bundle. This structure entails the canonical anticommu\u0002tation relations (CAR) algebra, which appears as a tensor factor acting on\r
the Hilbert space H.\r
Technically, the triple (1) satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spec\u0002tral triple. This is due to the fact that the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle\r
7

entails a large degeneracy of the spectrum of D which, naively, fails to have\r
compact resolvent. The solution to this problem is, in short, to integrate\r
out the symmetry group related to this degeneracy. This process leads to a\r
semi-finite spectral triple.\r
The Dirac type operator D is gauge invariant. It is, however, not invari\u0002ant under the group of discrete diffeomorphisms acting on H. This means\r
that D is, by itself, not an observable in a physical sense. We suggest to\r
apply a standard trick of Noncommutative Geometry: One obtains invari\u0002ant quantities by multiplying the algebra of observables with the relevant\r
symmetry group. A prime example of this method is the identification of\r
two points: By applying the noncommutative trick one obtains, besides in\u0002variance under exchange of the points, additional degrees of freedom which,\r
ultimately, leads to the Higgs mechanism. In the present case we expect this\r
general mechanism to entail further degrees of freedom.\r
Let us note in passing, that the algebra of holonomy loops that we work\r
with in this paper is smaller than the correponding algebra of Wilson loops.\r
However, the missing information is recovered by the Hopf algebra structure\r
of the algebra of holonomy loops. The missing information is coded in the\r
extra structure coming from the fact that it is given as a (norm closure of a)\r
group algebra\r
CrfL, L loops on Ss ,\r
where S denotes the entire inductive system of triangulations. As such it\r
has a Hopf algebra structure and for example the connections on M can be\r
recovered as Hopf algebra homomorphisms into the group algebra of G.\r
The construction of the Dirac type operator D is not unique. In fact,\r
we find a large class of Dirac type operators labelled by infinite sequences\r
tanu of real parameters. The operator D has compact resolvent whenever\r
the sequence diverges sufficiently fast. These parameters are related to the\r
scaling behaviour of the operator and are clearly of metric origin. Thus, in\r
order to obtain a Dirac type operator D we are forced to choose a certain\r
scaling behaviour.\r
It is clear that a correct interpretation of the sequence tanu is imperative\r
since the existence of the operator D depends crucially hereon. In this paper\r
we present one possible solution as to how these free parameters should be\r
dealt with. We propose an extension of the spectral triple (1) to include\r
the sequence tanu as dynamical degrees of freedom. The result is a new\r
triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq which is a fibration of spectral triples pB, D, Hq. We\r

(1). This paper is primarily concerned with the general construction and\r
physical interpretation of the triple. The second paper [22] deals with the\r

Before we go into details we first give a brief outline of the construction. The\r
first step is concerned with the formulation of a semi-finite spectral triple over\r
a space of connections. The triple is, as mentioned, based on a \u0006-algebra of\r
loops which we denote by B. A smooth loop l gives a map from the space\r
of smooth connections, denoted A, into the structure group G\r
l : ∇ Ñ Holp∇, lq P G ,\r
where Holp∇, lq is the holonomy of the connection ∇ P A along l and G is a\r
compact connected Lie group. In order to describe the algebra of holonomy\r
loops we first restrict the loop algebra to a finite graph Γ with edges ǫi (see\r
figure 1.1). Seen from Γ the connection ∇ can be seen as point ∇ in the\r
space Gn\r
∇ \u0010 pg1, . . . , gnq P G\r

where n is the number of edges in Γ and where gi \u0010 Holp∇, ǫiq is the holon\u0002omy transform along the i’th edge. That is, a connection is given by its\r
holonomy transforms along edges ǫi. Clearly, AΓ is a highly inaccurate pic\u0002ture of the full space A of connections. However, one can show [22] that for\r
a suitable choice of embedded graphs\r

This provides us with the strategy to construct a spectral triple over A. With\r
the system of graphs given by nested triangulations we construct, at the level\r
of each graph Γn, a spectral triple\r
pBn, Dn, HnqΓn\r

requirement that the construction of the triple should be compatible with\r
structure maps\r
Pnm : AΓn Ñ AΓm , n ¡ m\r
between the different coarse-grained spaces of field configurations.\r
The Dirac type operator obtained in the limit is an operator on the space\r
G8\r
and is of the general form\r
a1D1  a2D2  . . .  akDk  . . .\r
where Dk is an operator corresponding to a certain level in the projective sys\u0002tem (2) and where the infinite sequence taku determines the weight assigned\r
to each operator Dk. We find that for sequences satisfying\r

satisfies the requirements of a semi-finite spectral triple.\r
The second part of the construction is more tentative. This part is con\u0002cerned with the infinite sequence taku of free parameters which enters the\r
construction of the semi-finite spectral triple pB, D, Hq. The sequence taku\r
is readily seen to carry metric data since it determines the scaling behaviour\r
of the operator D. Also, the sequence determines the measure that arises\r
in the square of D. Furthermore, the choice of parameters taku is related\r
to the invariance properties of D. Based on these observations we choose to\r
include the sequence taku as dynamical parameters in the construction. This\r
means that we first construct a spectral triple\r
pAa, Da, Haq , (5)\r
where elements in the algebra Aa are functions f px1, x2, . . .q on the moduli\r
space of sequences taku satisfying condition (3). The construction of the\r
triple (5) is inspired by Higson and Kasparov [25]. The Hilbert space Ha is\r
a L\r
2\r
space of functions over this moduli space and Da is a Dirac operator\r
hereon. Next, we merge the triple (5) with the triple (4) to obtain a total\r
spectral triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq , (6)\r
where the Dirac type operator Dt combines the operators D and Da. It\r
is important to see that the first part of the Dirac operator, the operator\r
D, depends on the parameters taku which the second part, the operator Da,\r
probes. The exact form of this interdependency, which makes the operator\r
Dt highly nontrivial, is governed by the requirement that Ha is a Hilbert\r
space over an infinite dimensional space corresponding exactly to those se\u0002quences taku which leaves the operator D θ-summable.\r
The paper is organised as follows. Sections 2 - 4 give a self contained pre\u0002sentation of the mathematical construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r
Here, section 2 introduces the basic machinery used in this paper: First the\r
loop algebra associated to an abstract simplicial complex and the concept\r
of abstract connections associated to a simplicial complex. Thereafter pro\u0002jective systems of simplicial complexes. In section 3 we construct a spectral\r
triple on the level of a simplicial complex and in section 4 we obtain the\r
triple pB, D, Hq via an inductive limit of simplicial complexes.\r
Next, sections 5 - 8 are concerned with the physical significance of the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq. In section 5 we show that the spectral triple\r
11

involves a representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity. Then\r
in section 6 we give a detailed comparison between the setup presented in\r
this paper and the setup used in Loop Quantum Gravity and find that the\r
two constructions, on a technical level, differ primarily in the way the dif\u0002feomorphism group is treated. Section 7 briefly reviews area operators in\r
Loop Quantum Gravity and finds that the square of the Dirac operator D\r
has a natural interpretation as a kind of global area operator. This leads\r
naturally, in section 8, to an interpretation of the operator D2\r
 in terms of an\r
action. This, in turn, gives the spectral action of D a strong resemblance to\r
a partition function related to gravity.\r
Then, in section 9, we describe the construction of the spectral triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq which includes the sequence taku as dynamical variables. Finally,\r
in section 10 we mention that the Dirac type operator D defines a distance\r
on the space A\r
\r
. Sections 11 and 12 contain a discussion and conclusion.\r
Three appendices are added to outline first an extended setup which avoids\r
the choice of a basepoint and next to discuss again a notion of diffeomorphism\r
invariance. The last appendix is concerned with certain symmetric states."""

As explained in the introduction, the aim is to study geometrical structures\r

connections. This means that, rather than studying the space of connections\r
itself, we will work with an algebra of functions on the space. This algebra\r
is an algebra of loops and has a natural interpretation in terms of holonomy\r
loops.\r
The purpose of this section is to introduce the machinery needed to de\u0002scribe this algebra of loops. The strategy is to break up the algebra into\r
finite parts, introduce various geometrical structures on each finite part and\r
finally let the complexity of the construction increase infinitely to obtain the\r
full algebra of loops.\r
To emphasise the purely combinatorial nature of the construction we\r
adopt a formalism which, for the main part of the analysis, avoids any refer\u0002ence to an underlying manifold. This means that we will work with abstract\r

The question is whether the triple pB, D, Hq satisfies the requirements of\r
a spectral triple. Clearly, to have a true spectral triple is highly desirable,\r
first of all to ensure that we are operating on mathematically safe ground.\r
Also, the toolbox of Noncommutative Geometry is a rich one. It provides\r
not only metric structures to the underlying spaces involved, it also involves\r
aspects which does not exist in ordinary Riemannian geometry.\r
To have a spectral triple pB, D, H q where B is a C\r
Æ\r
-algebra represented\r
on a Hilbert space H on which an unbounded, selfadjoint operator D acts,\r
means that the two requirements\r
1. pλ \u0001 Dq\u00011\r
, where λ R R, is a compact operator\r
2. rb, Ds, where b P B, is a bounded operator and where B is a dense\r
Æ-subalgebra of B\r
are satisfied. However, the triple pB, D, Hq is not spectral in this sense.\r
The spectrum of D involves a large degeneracy due to the infinite dimen\u0002sional Clifford bundle. This means that the resolvent of D will not be com\u0002pact.\r
There exist, however, another sense in which a triple pB, D, H q can be\r
called spectral. If there exist a trace on the algebra containing B and the\r
spectral projections of D, then pB, D, H q is called a semi-finite spectral triple\r
if pλ \u0001 Dq\u00011\r
is compact with respect to this trace.\r
It turns out that the triple pB, D, Hq does form a semi-finite spectral\r
triple. The sufficient requirement is that the sequence taku satisfies\r
lim\r
k\r
ak Ñ 8 , sufficiently fast . (42)\r
A semi-finite spectral triple can be thought of as a spectral triple which\r
involves a redundant symmetry group. This symmetry group resembles a\r
gauge group and one must integrate out the extra degrees of freedom. In the\r
present case the symmetry group is identified as the endomorphisms of the\r
infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. To deal with this redundancy we first\r
define a trace on the algebra containing B as well as the spectral projections\r
of D.\r
We will construct the trace at each level in the inductive system of sim\u0002plicial complexes and subsequently take the limit of repeated barycentric\r
28

subdivisions. For the construction we factorize the Hilbert space. Choose a\r
global orthonormal frame in T\r

where K here denotes the compact operators.\r
Let T rop denote the operator trace on KpL\r
2\r
pGnqq. For each n we have\r
the normalised trace tr on EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e Gn\r
qq. We define the trace as\r
T r \u0010 T rop b T rl b tr. (44)\r
Note that the trace is independent of the choice of global orthonormal frame\r
in T\r
\u0006G, since a different choice of basis is given by a unitary transformation.\r
In [22] we prove that the limit\r
C :\u0010 lim Cn\r
will be a C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra and that the trace T r gives a trace on C. Since C\r
is contained in the weak closure of B the trace extends to a trace on B as\r
well.\r
The important point in this construction is the normalisation of the trace\r
tr on EndpClpT\r
\u0006\r
e Gn\r
qq. To explain this consider the step going from n to\r
n  m. Let Pλ be the spectral projection of Dn for the eigenvalue λ. Going\r
from n to n  m the spectral projection will roughly speaking be mapped\r
to Pλ b 1. Thus the size of the eigenspace λ grows in the same rate as the\r
dimension of the Clifford bundle. To remedy this defect we must ensure that\r
trp1q \u0010 1 ,\r
which is what the normalised trace does.\r
The proof that pB, D, Hq form a semi-finite spectral triple with respect\r
to the trace (44) is given in [22]. It turns out that in general the Dirac-type\r
operator (41) may require a perturbation at each level in the inductive sys\u0002tem. This perturbation deals with the fact that the operators Dn may, in\r
general, have nontrivial kernels which obstructs the control of the eigenvalues\r
of the limit operator D. These perturbations lift the entailed degeneracy,\r
29

which would otherwise destroy the spectral properties of the triple. The re\u0002quired perturbation is, at each level in the projective system, bounded and\r
does not affect the commutator between D and the algebra B significantly.\r
For the special case G \u0010 SU p2q we find that the operators Dn have trivial\r
kernels and therefore that no perturbations are needed.\r
To recapitulate, we have successfully constructed a large class of semi\u0002finite spectral triples pB, D, Hq. The triples are labelled by infinite se\u0002quences taku of real numbers satisfying limk ak Ñ 8 sufficiently fast.\r
Let us end this section with a short discussion of the structure of the\r
Hilbert space H the role of the infinite dimensional Clifford bundle. Consider\r
first the decomposition in (43) and rewrite it in the suggestive form\r
L\r
2\r

where Hn,b \u0010 L\r
2\r
pGnq b MlpCq. In the inductive limit this leads to the\r
decomposition\r
H \u0010 H,b b H,f .\r
Next we factorize the algebra H according to the above factorisation of the\r
Hilbert space. The result is\r
C \u0010 KpH,bq b C,\r
where\r
C \u0010 limn\r

\u0006\r
e Gn\r
q has dimension 2n\u0004dimpGq, the\r
C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra C is isomorphic to the CAR algebra.\r
The CAR algebra is an integral element of fermionic Quantum Field The\u0002ory. We find it interesting that this algebra naturally emerges from the triple\r
pB, D, Hq which, a priori, is an entirely ’bosonic’ construction. In section\r

Figure 5: The embedding of the system tKiu into M gives rise to an inductive\r

To see this consider the embedding φ of the simplicial complex Ki\r

where Tiis a triangulation of the manifold M. There is a natural map\r
χ : A Ñ A\r
\r

where Holp∇, φpǫiqq is the holonomy of ∇ along the edge φpǫiq which now has\r
a location in M via the embedding φ. Further, if we are given two different\r
connections ∇1, ∇2 P A they will differ in a point, say m P M, and hence\r
in a neighbourhood of m. We can therefore choose a small, directed edge\r
φpǫiq in a triangulation Ti that is sufficiently refined, so that φpǫiq lies in the\r
neighbourhood of m where the connections ∇1 and ∇2 differ. Furthermore,\r
because the system of triangulations contain edges in all directions in M we\r
can choose φpǫiq so that\r
Holp∇1, φpǫiqq \u007F\u0010 Holp∇2, φpǫiqq .\r

This means that we have successfully turned the map (15) into an injec\u0002tion by repeating the barycentric subdivisions of the simplicial complexes.\r
The identification of A\r
\r
as a space of connections provides us with a new\r
understanding of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. First, as already mentioned,\r
31

according to (45) the algebra of loops should be interpreted in terms of\r
holonomy loops\r
fLp∇q \u0012 HolpL, ∇q .\r
It is a well known result (see [26] and [27] and references therein) that the\r
complete set of holonomies, as well as their associated Wilson loops, contain\r
the full information, up to gauge transformations, about the underlying space\r
of smooth connections. The fact that the map (45) is an injection means that\r
the algebra B, which involves a highly restricted set of loops, does in fact\r
contain the same information about the underlying space of connections as\r
does the full set of smooth or piece-wise analytic loops.\r

\r
it should be understood in terms of a functional derivation operator\r
D \u0012\r
δ\r

in some integrated sense which shall become clearer soon. Finally, elements\r

In section 9 we will include the sequence tanu as dynamical variables in the\r
construction. To motivate this step we need a better understanding of the\r
sequence tanu and the role it plays in the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r
Primarily, the role of the sequence tanu is to shift an otherwise impossible\r
degeneracy in the spectrum of the operator D via the condition (42). The\r
parameters aiintroduces a hierarchy between the eigenvalues of D on the\r
infinitely many copies of G in A\r

pGqqK. Functions in V correspond to information which is\r
also contained in the less refined picture which involves only one copy of G.\r
This is the simplest and most coarse-grained description of parallel transports\r
along the line segment available. Function in VK, on the other hand, contain\r
additional information which cannot be traced back to the simpler picture.\r
Each additional division of the line segment refines the picture further.\r
It is clear that any division of a line segment into two will involve new\r
segments which are shorter - independently of any choice of metric - than\r
the original segment. Therefore, functions in VK correspond to information\r
about A\r
\r
which is deeper, i.e. at a shorter distance, compared to information\r
carried by functions in V .\r
The role of the sequence taiu is to take this scaling behaviour into account.\r
The operator D weights functions on A\r

according to where in the projective\r
system of spaces Ai the information originates (see figure 6). Therefore, if\r

On the other hand, if A\r

Let us end this subsection with a curious observation. If we start with a\r
meter, then we find that it takes about 116 subdivisions of the meter to reach\r
the Planck length of 1.6 \u0002 10\u000135 meter. This corresponds then to 116 of the\r
parameters taiu. Thus, although the sequence taiu is infinite, the number of\r
parameters involved when probing physical scales is certainly finite."""

\r
and A\r
a\r
So far we have introduced the three spaces A, A\r
\r

a\r
. A is the space of\r
smooth G-connections and we demonstrated that\r
A ãÑ A\r
\r
, A ãÑ A\r
a\r
,\r
which means that both A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
are spaces of generalised connections.\r
Furthermore, since it is known that A is dense in A\r
a\r
, and since there exist a\r
natural surjection\r
σ : A\r
a Ñ A\r
\r
we know that A, too, is dense in A\r
\r
. To see how the surjection σ works recall\r
that both A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
are spaces of homomorphisms\r
A\r
\r
\u0010 HompP, Gq , A\r
a\r
\u0010 HompPa, Gq , (65)\r
45

and since12 tPu ãÑ tPau then σ is just the corresponding surjection between\r
the spaces (65) of homomorphisms.\r
To be precise we should state that we now think of the space A\r
\r
in terms\r
of an embedding\r
φ : Ki Ñ Ti\r
of the projective system tKiu, and that we therefore identify\r
A\r
\r
\u0010 lim\r
T\u001C\r
AT .\r
In the following we will demonstrate the relationship between and role\r
played by these three spaces of connections.\r
First, it is important to see that the shift from A to a larger space of\r
generalised connections is necessary to equip A with topological and Hilbert\r
space structures. The identification of A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
as pro-manifolds is the key\r
step to obtain this. The space A itself is not a pro-manifold.\r
The key difference between the two spaces A\r
\r
and A\r
a\r
is that A\r
a\r
has an\r
action of the (analytic) diffeomorphism group; A\r
\r
does not. Further, the\r
Hilbert space structure associated to the two spaces are respectively non\u0002separable for A\r
a\r
and separable for A\r
\r
. That is, the way A is completed is\r
decisive for how large a symmetry group remains. This shows that there is a\r
direct link between separability of the Hilbert space structure and the action\r
of the diffeomorphism group.\r
The following diagram illustrate the relationship between the three spaces\r
of connections:\r
A\r

\u001C diffp△q\r
where we by diffp△q refer to the discrete symmetries which remain on the\r
infinite triangulation underlying A\r
\r
.\r
It is interesting that the construction of the Dirac-like operator (41) re\u0002quires the shift from A\r
a\r
to A\r
\r
: In [20] the authors attempted to construct\r
such an operator on A\r
a\r
and a corresponding Hilbert space. The attempt\r
was unsuccessful exactly because the number of possible projections (64) is\r
12we assume here that the edges in the triangulations Ti are analytic. This depends on\r
the embedding φ : Ki Ñ Ti but is no real restriction.\r
46

too large to permit a Hilbert space structure carrying a Dirac-like operator\r
similar to (41). The shift from A\r
a\r
to A\r
\r
reduces the type of embeddings\r
between graphs sufficiently. We appear to find the following hierarchy:\r
A : No Hilbert space structure\r
No Dirac-like operator\r
Action of diff(M)\r
A\r
a\r
: Hilbert space structure, non-separable\r
No Dirac-like operator\r
Action of analytic diffeomorphisms\r
A\r
\r
: Hilbert space structure, separable\r
Dirac-like operator\r
Action of diff(△)\r
One way to think of the space A\r
\r
is to see it as the space of (smooth)\r
connections subjected to a sort of gauge fixing of the diffeomorphism group13.\r
Here gauge fixing is meant in the sense that a symmetry group is (partly)\r
removed while the integration at hand still involves the entire space, in this\r
case the space of smooth connections A. In this sense the inner product (46)\r
resembles a functional integral over A ”up to diffeomorphisms”.\r
Another way to think of the space A\r
\r
is to relate it to the construction\r
of the Hilbert space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states in Loop Quan\u0002tum Gravity, see [23]. To do this we first notice that each triangulation in\r
particular is a graph, and we hence get an embedding\r

TÝÑ\r

On the other hand consider the Hilbert space formally defined by\r
Hdif f \u0010 diffeomorphism invariant states in limΓÝÑ\r
L\r
2\r
pAΓq.\r
The elaborate definition is written in [23]. There is a surjection\r
limΓÝÑL\r
2\r
pAΓq\r
qÑ Hdif f\r
13In fact, space A\r
a\r
is, in this line of thinking, subjected to another partial gauge fixing\r
by reducing the symmetry group from the group of diffeomorphisms to the .group of\r
analytical diffeomorphisms.\r
47

given by meaning vectors over the action of the diffeomorphism group. We\r
thus get a map\r
lim\r
TÝÑ\r
L\r
2\r
pAT q\r
ΞÝÑ Hdif f\r
by composing. This map is also going to be a surjection since each graph\r
can, via a diffeomorphism, be mapped into a triangulated graph. The map\r
is not injective because of the symmetries of the triangulated graph.\r
We have the following commutative diagram\r
limÝÑ L\r
2\r
pAΓq\r
ι\r
Õ Ó q\r
limÝÑ L\r
2\r
pAT q\r
ΞÝÑ Hdif f\r
(66)\r
The amount by which the map Ξ fails to be injective is exactly the symmetry\r
group diffp△q of discrete diffeomorphisms of triangulations. Therefore, we\r
can think of the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pAT q, and thereby also H, as Hilbert spaces\r
of diffeomorphism invariant states up to the discrete group diffp△q. In this\r
picture one should therefore think of a loop associated to a simplicial complex\r
as a kind of equivalence class of smooth loops where the equivalence is with\r
respect to smooth diffeomorphisms.\r
It is interesting that the construction of H relies on a partition of the\r
diffeomorphism group in a ’countable’ and a ’over countable’ part. Here,\r
the countable part is diffp△q. This partition is a compromise between two\r
opposite considerations:\r
• For the Hilbert space H to carry a representation of the loop algebra\r
it must have an action of at least parts of the diffeomorphism group\r
since the loop algebra itself is not diffeomorphism invariant. This re\u0002quirement works to maximise the size of the remaining symmetry group\r
diffp△q.\r
• The construction of a Dirac type operator acting on H requires a strict\r
control over permissible embeddings of the type (16). This requirement\r
works to minimise the size of diffp△q.\r
Therefore, the identification of the symmetry group diffp△q is essential for\r
the construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq.\r

The identification of the operator D2\r
 as a global operator related to the area\r
of the underlying manifold leads us to a new interpretation of the spectral\r
triple pB, D, Hq. In this section we suggest that the operator D2\r
 should be\r
thought of as an action. Subsequently, we point out that the spectral action\r
51

of D resembles a partition function. The argumentation presented in the\r
following is tentative.\r
The first indication that pDq\r
2 may be understood in terms of an action is,\r
as already mentioned, that is has the form of an integral over an underlying\r
manifold.\r
The second indication is directly related to the classical Einstein-Hilbert\r
action. Within the language of Noncommutative Geometry the Einstein\u0002Hilbert action has a natural interpretation as an area of the underlying man\u0002ifold. With the previous section in mind this suggest that the operator pDq\r
2\r
is somehow related to the Einstein-Hilbert action.\r
Let us go into some details. Consider a 4-dimensional, Riemannian spin\u0002geometry described by the real, even spectral triple pA, D, H q where A is a\r
commutative C\r
\u0006\r
-algebra. The Eucledian Einstein-Hilbert action on M can\r
be computed directly from D. It is proportional to the Wodzicki residue of\r
the inverse square of the Dirac operator D [37]. If we denote by T rthe\r
Dixmier trace and define the noncommutative integral \u001F\r

where dv \u0010\r

gd4x is the volume form and R is the scalar curvature. It\r
is in this sense that one may interpret the Einstein-Hilbert action as the\r
”two-dimensional measure of a four manifold”, the ”area” of M [38].\r
This resembles the findings of the previous section where we saw that the\r
operator D2\r
 has a natural interpretation in terms of a global area-squared\r
operator over an underlying manifold. If we ignore the obvious issue of ’area’\r
vs. ’area-squared’ one may speculate whether there is some deeper relation\r
between the operator D2\r
 and the Einstein-Hilbert action.\r
These considerations entail an interesting interpretation of the spectral\r
action of D. Consider the quantity\r

will argue that there may be another solution which is more natural. This\r
section is concerned with this issue.\r
In section 5 we demonstrated that the triple pB, D, Hq has a natural\r
interpretation in terms of Poisson brackets of canonical gravity. In this pic\u0002ture the Dirac type operator D, including the sequence taiu, is a linear sum\r

(56). This suggest an interpretation of the parameters aiin terms of the\r
determinant of the vielbein\r

That the sequence taiu carries metric information also comes out of the\r
discussion in subsection 4.5 where we relate the sequence taiu to the scaling\r
behaviour of the construction.\r
Thirdly, in section 7 we found that the square of D has the form of an\r
integral over the underlying manifold. Here, the measure involved in this\r
integral is given by the sequence taiu.\r
This suggests, as a possible solution to the first question, that we should\r
include the sequence taiu in the construction as dynamical variables. If the\r
sequence taiu has a metric origin, then it seems natural to try to integrate\r
over these degrees of freedom.\r
Therefore we extend the spectral triple pB, D, Hq to include the se\u0002quence taku as dynamical variables. By doing this we obtain a new triple,\r
denoted pBt, Dt, Htq, which is a fibration of triples pB, D, Hq over the space\r

The exact relationship between vectors txku in H and the sequences taku\r
satisfying condition (42) will be determined in the following.\r
In order to construct a Dirac operator on H we first need a Hilbert space\r
structure over H. The goal is to construct a spectral triple over H.\r
The techniques used to construct L\r
2\r
pH q and the corresponding spectral\r
triple are essentially the same techniques we used to construct the space A\r
\r
and the triple pB, D, Hq. The following is based on ideas by Higson and\r
Kasparov, see [25].\r
The strategy is to consider first finite dimensional subspaces Hn of H,\r
corresponding Hilbert spaces L\r
2\r
pHnq and structure maps\r
P\r
\u0006\r
m,n : L\r
2\r
pHnq Ñ L\r
2\r
pHmq , n ¤ m\r
between Hilbert spaces. Next step is to construct a spectral triple over each\r
space Hn, ensure compatibility with the structure maps P\r
\u0006\r
m,n and finally\r
obtain a triple over H by taking the limit n Ñ 8.\r
There are two potential difficulties with this strategy:\r
• The spaces Hn are non-compact. The construction of the spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq relies strongly on the fact that G is compact. This is a\r
necessary condition to construct the structure maps P\r
\u0006\r
(24) between\r
Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we used the fact that the constant function\r
is square integrable. This is no-longer the case when the underlying\r
space is non-compact.\r
55

• The Dirac type operator, which we aim to construct, will have a non\u0002compact resolvent. This is the same problem we encountered when\r
we constructed the operator D and a problem which will always arise\r
when one constructs a Dirac like operator on an infinite dimensional\r
space (see also [25]). This problem was solved in section 3 by intro\u0002ducing the parameters taiu, whose presence is the very reason why we\r
now wish to construct the extended triple pBt, Dt, Htq. Therefore, it\r
appears that we are in danger of a circular argument: Certainly, we do\r
not wish to introduce yet another infinite sequence to ensure a well be\u0002haved Dirac operator acting on L\r
2\r
pH q entailing yet another extension\r
of pBt\r
, Dt, Htq and so forth.\r
It turns out that there exist a way to construct the triple pBt\r
, Dt, Htq\r
which avoids these two technical pitfalls.\r
The first problem is related to the fact the canonical map from Hn to Hm\r
is given by ξ Ñ ξ b 1n,m, where 1n,m is the identity function on the m \u0001 n\r
dimensional orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm. However, the function\r
1n,m is not a L\r
2\r
-function and therefore the canonical map is not a map\r
between Hilbert spaces. We can remedy this defect by finding a suitable L\r
2\r
-\r
function φn,m to replace the constant function 1n,m. The choice of function\r
φn,m is restricted by the requirement that it must lie in the kernel of the\r
Dirac type operator, which we wish to construct, when this is restricted to\r
the orthogonal complement to Hn in Hm.\r
The second problem is related to the fact that we are dealing with an\r
infinite dimensional space. To solve this problem we modify the canonical\r
algebra of functions on Hn to include operators which project onto finite\r
dimensional subspaces."""

\r
On a Riemannian spin-geometry the Dirac operator D contains the geomet\u0002rical information of the manifold M. In particular, distances can be formu\u0002lated purely algebraically due to Connes [1]. Given two points x, y P M their\r
distance is given by\r

f PC8pMq\r
 \r
|f pxq \u0001 f pyq| }rD, f s} ¤ 1\r
(\r
. (86)\r
On a Noncommutative Geometry the state space replaces the notion of\r
points. It is possible to extend the notion of distance to the state space\r
by generalising (86).\r
In the present case it is natural to ask whether the Dirac-like operator\r
D introduces a metric structure over the space A\r
\r
and if so, how distances\r
should be interpreted in this setting.\r
The possibility for a distance between smooth connections in A and some\r
closure hereof was first considered in [20]. There, however, the distance\r
between two smooth connections was found to be infinite, since two smooth\r
connections will differ on infinitely many different loops. This entails a finite\r
contribution to the distance from infinitely many copies of G.\r
In the present setting the situation is different due to the sequence taiu.\r
The role of the ai’s is to assign a weight to each copy of G and therefore to\r
63

scale the corresponding distance on G. Therefore, given two points in A\r
\r
their distance\r

, (87)\r
where we choose }\u0004} as the operator norm on matrices in MlpCq, is well defined\r
and finite, even for ∇1, ∇2 P A. This is related to the fact that although our\r
geometry on A\r
\r
is infinite dimensional it assigns A\r
\r
zero volume.\r
The distance (87), when it is applied to smooth connections, is not inde\u0002pendent of the embedding h of simplicial complexes into triangulations.\r
With a metric structure on the space A\r
\r
it is natural to ask which con\u0002nections are ’close’ to each other. Clearly, this depends on the choice of the\r
sequence taiu. However, it is possible to give some general remarks indepen\u0002dently of this choice.\r
Recall that the space A\r
\r
is the limit space limn Gnin an appropriate sense.\r
The distance between ∇1, ∇2 P AKiis simply the sum of geodesic distances\r
on each copy of G, weighted with the appropriate parameters ai. In the\r
previous section we found that the role of the parameters taiu is to scale\r
the different copies of G according to their location in the projective system\r
of simplicial complexes. The larger ai’s corresponds to short distances, now\r
with respect to some manifold. This means that the the distance between\r
∇1 and ∇2 is larger if the connections differ mostly on those copies of G\r
which are assigned small ai’s. Correspondingly, the distance between ∇1 and\r
∇2 is smaller if ∇1 and ∇2 differ mostly on those copies of G which are\r
assigned large ai’s. Therefore, in general, the two generalised connections\r
will be ’close’ to each other if they differ mostly at short scales.\r
Via Levi-Civita connections we can interpret equation (87) as a distance\r
between geometries14. Again we can say that the distance between two ge\u0002ometries depends on the scale on which they differ.\r
Let us consider the Abelian case G \u0010 U p1q and two points ∇1, ∇2 in A\r
\r
.\r
In this case ∇1 and ∇2 are given by sequences of angles tθ\r
1\r
i\r
u and tθ\r
2\r
i\r
u where\r
each angle θ\r
j\r
i\r
corresponds to points expp2πiθ\r
j\r
i\r
q on the i’th copies of U p1q. Let\r
us for simplicity choose a coordinate system on Gnso that θ\r
j\r
i\r
corresponds to\r
the parameter ai. Thus, for example, if we consider G \u0002 G parametrised by\r
angles φ1 and φ2 we choose\r
θ1 \u0010 φ1  φ2 , θ2 \u0010 φ1 \u0001 φ2\r
14In this case, however, the distance formula will be degenerate since different geometries\r
may have identical Levi-Civita connections.\r
64

and so forth. Then the distance between ∇1 and ∇2 reads\r

which should be read together with the condition (75).\r
The notion of a distance on a space of connections is not a new one but\r
was discussed already by Feynman [39] and Singer [40]. See also [41] and ref\u0002erences herein. However, these papers all deal with distances between gauge\r
equivalence classes of connections. The construction presented in this paper\r
is quite different from these previous works since two connections which differ\r
by a gauge transformation will, in general, have a non vanishing distance."""

As already mentioned, the shift to Ashtekar variables permits a formulation\r
of General Relativity which is close to ordinary Yang-Mills theory. In the\r
Hamilton formulation the theory involves a configuration space of connec\u0002tions corresponding to ordinary SU p2q Yang-Mills theory. The essential dif\u0002ference between General Relativity and Yang-Mills theory lies in the algebra\r
of constraints which encode the symmetries of the theory. For General Rel\u0002ativity the constraints encode diffeomorphism invariance. These constraints\r
are closely related to the foliation of the spacetime M according to\r
Σ \u0002 R Ñ M , (88)\r
where Σ is a 3-dimensional hypersurface. Loosely stated, the constraints\r
encode information about diffeomorphisms within and perpendicular to Σ.\r
Therefore, the key question in any quantization procedure of gravity is the\r
implementation of diffeomorphism invariance in the construction.\r
To quantize a constrained theory there are in general two standard ap\u0002proaches:\r
65

a) To eleminate first, at a classical level, the constraints and thereby find\r
the reduced phase space of the theory. The quantization procedure is\r
applied to the reduced phase space.\r
b) To construct first quantum kinematics for the full phase space by ig\u0002noring the constraints, then construct operators corresponding to the\r
classical constraints and finally solve the quantum constraints to obtain\r
the physical Hilbert space.\r
Loop Quantum Gravity follows the second approach which is due to Dirac\r
(see [42] for a detailed exposition). In section 5.2 we demonstrated that the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq involves a representation of the Poisson algebra\r
(55) of General Relativity. In our interpretation, the construction should\r
be understood as a quantization scheme which lies somewhere between the\r
approaches a) and b).\r
First of all, there is nothing in the geometrical construction that corre\u0002sponds directly to the constraint algebra of General Relativity. However, in\r
section 6 we related the Hilbert space H to the diffeomorphism invariant\r
Hilbert space Hdif f of Loop Quantum Gravity. The difference between H\r
and Hdif f is the group diff(△) of discrete diffeomorphisms on the system of\r
simplicial complexes. Therefore, we think of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq\r
as a geometrical construction describing a quantization procedure of gravity\r
on a Hilbert space which corresponds to a partial solution to the (spatial)\r
diffeomorphism constraint. What remains then, in this picture, is the imple\u0002mentation of the remaining diffeomorphisms encoded in the discrete group\r
diff(△).\r
The second point in which our construction differs from canonical quan\u0002tum gravity is the issue of time. Clearly, a foliation of the manifold is essential\r
for canonical gravity since the Hamilton formulation is based on a choice of\r
an explicit time direction. In contrast to this, the construction presented here\r
does not a priori involve a foliation of space-time. Further, the dimension of\r
the underlying space is completely free. The only restriction is the choice of\r
symmetry group, which, for now, has to be compact15. In particular, we can\r
consider triangulations of a 4-dimensional manifold.\r
These observations suggest two possible interpretations of the construc\u0002tion: First, the construction may be interpreted as a completely covariant\r
construction in four dimensions, involving the full, four-dimensional group\r
15The case G \u0010 SOp1, 3q, for example, is not permitted.\r
66

of diffeomorphisms. This interpretation leaves no room for a foliation and\r
thus no Hamiltonian constraint. Therefore, a dynamical principle replacing\r
the Hamiltonian constraint must be sought elsewhere. This interpretation\r
implies that the group G corresponds to four-dimensional local Lorentz rota\u0002tions. Next, if the loop algebra lives on a four-dimensional manifold, then the\r
interpretation of the Dirac type operator D in terms of canonical quantum\r
gravity must involve a flux operator F\r
a\r
S where S is now a three-dimensional\r
hypersurface. Further, the interaction between D and the algebra of loops\r
should be understood as a four-dimensional operator algebra containing a\r
representation of the Poisson algebra of General Relativity as a kind of sub\u0002algebra.\r
Alternatively, we may interpret the construction as fundamentally three\u0002dimensional, with G equal to SU p2q. This interpretation does not necessarily\r
mean that we consider a foliation of space-time according to (88). Rather,\r
we would like time to emerge naturally from the construction.\r
Indeed, let us end this discussion with the remark that the philosophy of\r
Noncommutative Geometry is to seek a time within the algebraic construc\u0002tion rather than imposing it a priori. Here we think of the Tomita-Takesaki\r
theory [43] which identifies a one-parameter automorphism group uniquely\r
up to inner automorphisms. It is an interesting question whether this group\r
of modular automorphisms is nontrivial in this or perhaps some similar con\u0002struction. If the answer is in the affirmative, then this might provide us with\r
an alternative to the foliation and thereby with a new dynamical principle."""

that the framework presented in this paper contains additional degrees of\r

First, recall that the framework of Noncommutative Geometry generally\r
involves fermionic degrees of freedom since it involves a Dirac type operator\r
acting on a Hilbert space16. The ’fermions’ involved in the spectral triple\r
pB, D, Hq are clearly very different from the fermions of the Standard\r

degrees of freedom for the fermions. Therefore the interesting question is\r
what structures may emerge from these ’fermions’ in a classical limit.\r
Furthermore, during the construction of the the triple pB, D, Hq we\r

H \u0010 H,b b H,f ,\r

both bosonic and fermionic sectors.\r

In this paper we establish a link between the mathematics of Noncommu\u0002tative Geometry and the field of canonical quantum gravity. We construct\r
a spectral triple pB, D, Hq over a space of connections and show that the\r
Poisson structure of General Relativity, formulated in terms of loop variables,\r
is encoded in the interaction between the Dirac type operator D and the\r
loop algebra B. The Hilbert space H corresponds to a partial solution of\r
the diffeomorphism constraint of canonical gravity. The inner product of H\r
involves a functional integral over a space of connections and the Dirac type\r
operator D has the form of a global functional derivation. Consequently, we\r
interpret the triple in terms of a non-perturbative, background independent,\r
quantum field theory.\r
The construction is based on a projective system of simplicial complexes.\r
The simplicial complexes are related through repeated barycentric subdivi\u0002sions. The triple pB, D, Hq is the limit of spectral triples formulated at\r
the level of finite simplicial complexes. Since the operation of barycentric\r
subdivision is countable the limit triple is separable and spectral.\r
The square of the Dirac type operator has, in terms of canonical quan\u0002tum gravity, a natural interpretation as global operator related to the area\r
operators known in Loop Quantum Gravity. We interpret the operator pDq\r
2\r
in terms of an action and show that the spectral action of D has the form\r
of a Feynman path integral. Thus, at the core of the construction we find an\r
object which resembles a partition function related to Quantum Gravity.\r
The construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq differs from a tradi\u0002tional canonical quantization procedure of General Relativity in the way the\r
group of diffeomorphisms is treated. Rather than encoding the symmetries\r
of the classical theory in a set of constraints the construction works directly\r
on a Hilbert space H which corresponds to a partial solution of the (spa\u0002tial) diffeomorphism constraint. The existence of the spectral triple relies\r
on a particular split of the diffeomorphism group into a countable and an\r
over-countable part. The over-countable part is discarded of; the group of\r
countable diffeomorphisms is the group diffp△q of diffeomorphisms between\r
simplicial complexes. This means that the Poisson algebra of General Rela\u0002tivity is represented on the separable Hilbert space H."""

taiu. These parameters determine the scaling behaviour of the construction.\r
We believe that a correct understanding and treatment of these parameters\r
is essential. In this paper we propose a possible way to treat the sequence\r
taiu. Since the sequence is seen to have metric origin we propose to include\r
it as a dynamical variable in the construction. This leads to a new triple,\r
denoted pBt\r
, Dt, Htq, which includes the spectral triple pB, D, Hq as well\r
as a sector permitting the sequence taiu to vary. The triple pBt, Dt, Htq is\r
constructed to ensure that the operator D is θ-summable. Thus, we permit\r
only sequences taiu which leaves the spectral action of D finite.\r
Furthermore, the Dirac type operator D defines a distance on the un\u0002derlying space of connections. Clearly, this distance depends strongly on the\r
sequence taiu. However, we find that a general feature of this distance func\u0002tion is that two connections are ”close” if they differ mostly at short scales.\r
It is possible to read this paper in a more conservative way, discarding the\r
role of Noncommutative Geometry and reading it as a reformulation of Loop\r
Quantum Gravity. If we ignore the construction of the Dirac type operator\r
D and focus instead on the algebra B and the Hilbert space H, with\u0002out the Clifford bundle, and consider the algebra of the vectors Eˆi\r
j\r

already mentioned, we obtain a representation of the Poisson algebra of Gen\u0002eral Relativity on a separable Hilbert space. Therefore, this Hilbert space, let\r

a\r
q\r
known as the kinematical Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity. In Loop\r
Quantum Gravity the kinematical Hilbert space is the Hilbert space on which\r
the constraints of General Relativity are defined. Thus, one could formulate\r
the complete set of constraints of General Relativity in terms of operators\r
acting on the Hilbert space H1\r
. First, as explained in section 6, the Hilbert\r
space H1\r
 has an action of the reduced set of diffeomorphisms diffp△q. There\u0002fore the spatial diffeomorphism constraint should be formulated in terms of\r
the group diffp△q. Next, one may likewise formulate the Gauss and Hamil\u0002tonian constraints of Loop Quantum Gravity on H1\r
. The central message\r
here is that it is possible to formulate Loop Quantum Gravity in terms of\r
a separable kinematical Hilbert space. It is an interesting question whether\r
this observation will have an impact on any of the challenges facing Loop\r

Let us finally remind the reader that the focus of this paper is the physi\u0002cal significance of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. The detailed mathematical\r
analysis of the triple is given in [22].\r
Outlook\r
More analysis is needed to understand the physical and mathematical\r
significance of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq. First of all it is imperative\r
to understand the role and proper treatment of the sequence taiu since this\r
sequence is central to the existence of the triple. Let us here just say that\r
the sequence taiu should be understood in connection with the group of\r
diffeomorphisms diffp△q since elements hereof are given by rearrangement of\r
the parameters ai. Having said this, let us list other issues which we think\r
deserves attention.\r
- First, we have seen that the spectral action resembles a Feynman path\r
integral. We believe that the computation and analysis of the spectral\r
action is the most interesting task to address at the present stage of the\r
project. Here one should consider the Dirac operator which involves\r
the inner fluctuations described in section 11.\r
- A prime issue for any theory or framework for non-perturbative Quan\u0002tum Gravity is the formulation of a semi-classical limit. In the present\r
case the aim is to obtain a classical limit which involves not only a\r
smooth geometry - characterised by a commutative \u0006-algebra - but to\r
obtain a limit which includes an additional matrix factor of the type\r
that characterises the almost commutative algebra in Connes’ formula\u0002tion of the Standard Model. Indeed, since Connes’ geometrical realiza\u0002tion of the Standard Model is so attractive and powerful as it stands,\r
it remains to understand why the algebra which lies at the heart of\r
this formulation should have this particular noncommutativity. We\r
suggest that the source of this noncommutativity lies in pure Quan\u0002tum Gravity. Recall that the loop algebra B is essentially an almost\r
commutative algebra over the space A of connections. That is, it is\r
a product of smooth functions over A and a matrix factor MlpCq. If\r
we think of a classical limit as the emergence of a single geometry it\r
seems reasonable to expect something close to a delta function peaked\r
around a connection ∇. However, when we apply the loop algebra on a\r
73

delta function it reduces to the matrix factor MlpCq or some subalgebra\r
hereof. Furthermore, if we keep in mind that the construction of the\r
spectral triple pB, D, Hq involves a choice of a basepoint17, then it\r
seems possible that a similar construction which does not involve this\r
basepoint will entail a smearing of the matrix factor over the manifold.\r
Thus, we speculate that the matrix factor behind the noncommutative\r
formulation of the Standard Model emerges in the classical limit from\r
the noncommutative algebra of holonomy loops.\r
We suspect this issue to be related to the calculation of the spectral\r
action. However, one should also investigate whether ideas from Loop\r
Quantum Gravity concerning coherent states [44] can be applied.\r
- The question about time is fundamental to any general covariant theory\r
since such theories have no preferred time flow. This situation is even\r
more complicated when one attempts to include quantum theory since\r
this will presumable lead to a theory which involves some notion of\r
superpositions of geometries and thus does not permit any notion of\r
a predetermined time. A possible solution to this problem has been\r
proposed by Connes (see for example [38]. See also [45] for similar\r
ideas developed by Connes and Rovelli). The idea is that the concept\r
of time is intimately linked to the noncommutativity of the algebra\r
of observables of Quantum Gravity. Specifically, it is a fundamental\r
property of von Neumann algebras that they possess a 1-parameter\r
family of automorphisms which is unique up to inner automorphisms.\r
Thus, the idea is that this group of automorphisms, the modular group,\r
should be understood in terms of a time. It is therefore natural to ask\r
whether the noncommutative \u0006-algebras introduced in this paper give\r
rise to a nontrivial modular group and whether this can be interpreted\r
as a time flow.\r
Alternatively, one might try to exploit the fact that the construction\r
presented in this paper is basically quantum mechanics on the group\r
G taken infinitely many times. Here, each copy of G corresponds to a\r
degree of freedom originating somewhere on the underlying manifold.\r
Thus, one could consider the time evolution, with respect to one copy\r
of G, given by the operator exppi∆tq where ∆ is the Laplace operator.\r

basepoint."""

- The construction of the spectral triple pB, D, Hq starts with a sim\u0002plicial complex. It is an important question to determine the exact\r
dependency of the triple on the choice of initial complex. For instance,\r
consider two simplicial complexes K1 and K2 chosen so that their union\r
is the barycentric subdivision of yet another simplicial complex K3.\r
Does the construction depend on whether one chooses K3 or the union\r
of K1 and K2 as the initial complex? The answer is, a priori, yes, since\r
the two choices will come with different sequences of parameters taiu.\r
The exact nature of this dependency needs to be clarified. Clearly, the\r
idea is that the spectral triple should depend only on topological data\r
coming from the underlying manifold. A related issue is the merging\r
of different spectral triples based on different simplicial complexes. By\r
gluing complexes it should be possible to move from one topological\r
setting to another. These issues are all connected with the sequence\r
taiu and the group of diffeomorphisms in diffp△q.\r
- A related issue is the possibility to obtain a similar construction based\r
on a different projective system of graphs. The choice of simplicial com\u0002plexes (or, triangulations) and barycentric subdivisions seems natural\r
but is not compulsory. In [22] we provide certain necessary require\u0002ments for a system of graphs to be suitable for the construction of a\r
spectral triple. These requirements leave room for projective systems\r
of graphs which are not simplicial complexes. Again, more analysis is\r
needed to determine the dependency of the final construction on dif\u0002ferent choices of graphs. It is clear that a projective system of graphs\r
must be countable in order to permit the construction of a spectral\r
triple.\r
- It is desirable to be able to deal also with a non-compact gauge group\r
such as SOp3, 1q. At present, the compactness of the gauge group is\r
essential for the construction of the Hilbert space to work. Basically,\r
we need the identity to be an L\r
2\r
-function with respect to the Haar\r
measure. One could speculate whether the techniques of Higson and"""

to use a Dirac operator with a nontrivial square-integrable kernel and\r
to define embeddings between Hilbert spaces via this kernel.\r
- One should further clarify the relation between the construction pre\u0002sented here and Loop Quantum Gravity. In particular, it would be\r
interesting to understand if there is a relation between the operator D\r
and the Hamilton constraint. Here one should most likely consider the\r
fluctuated version of D, with respect to inner automorphisms, since\r
this operator involves also the loop algebra.\r
- It is an interesting question whether the construction presented in this\r
paper has anything to say about nonperturbative gauge theory. Con\u0002sider a single line segment and the sequence an \u0010 a02\r
n\r

an \u0012 2\r
n\r
is too weak for the Dirac type operator to have a compact\r
resolvent. If we consider instead the sequence an \u0010 a0p2  |ǫ|qnthen\r
D will have a compact resolvent as long as ǫ is non-zero. This setup is\r
then extended to all line segments in the projective system of graphs.\r
As long as ǫ is non-zero the corresponding spectral action of D is well\r
defined and resembles a Feynman path integral over a space of connec\u0002tions. The interesting question is what theory this object represents. It\r
seems clear that it should be understood as a non-perturbative Quan\u0002tum Field Theory involving a gauge field. The setup resembles lattice\r
gauge theory with the crucial difference that a lattice spacing is ab\u0002sent and that one does not have the freedom to choose an action. It\r
would be interesting to calculate the spectral action and, subsequently,\r
to take the limit ǫ Ñ 0. Presumably, this limit will lead to divergences\r
since the operator D ceases to have compact resolvent when ǫ \u0010 0.\r
One can speculate whether these divergences might correspond to the\r
divergences found in perturbative Quantum Field Theory.\r

basepoint partly breaks diffeomorphism invariance we would like to obtain\r
a structure which avoids the basepoint. It turns out that such a construc\u0002tion does exist. Instead of the group structure of loops this more general\r

the action of certain operators on L\r

q to the larger Hilbert space L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q\r
and thereby introduce a notion of (analytic) diffeomorphism invariance for\r
these operators. This setup involves an embedding of general piecewise ana\u0002lytic graphs Γ into triangulations Ti coming from the projective system tKiu.\r
Therefore, the action of these operators on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q will depend on a choice\r
of embedding. It is important to realize that this construction does not work\r

The following should be read as a rough idea or strategy as to how one\r
introduces a notion of diffeomorphism invariance on L\r

q, rather than a\r
complete analysis.\r
Let us go into details. Given an element ξΓ P L\r
2\r
pA\r
a\r
q associated to a\r
piece-wise analytic graph Γ we choose an embedding of a suitable simplicial\r
complex Ki\r
φ : Ki Ñ Ti\r
,\r
where Tiis a triangulation in M, so that Γ lies in Ti. Consider an operator\r
O on L\r
2\r
pA\r
\r
q. This could for example be the Laplace operator. The action\r
of O on ξΓ is defined as\r
OpξΓq :\u0010 φpOpφ\r
\u00011\r
ξΓqq .\r
If we map d : ξΓ Ñ ξdpΓq with a diffeomorphism d then the action of O\r
changes accordingly\r
OpξdpΓqq :\u0010 φ\r
1\r
pOppφ\r
1\r
q\u00011ξΓqq ,\r
where φ\r
1\r
is a new embedding. We obtain the diagram\r

where d and d\r

state means that the state is invariant under diffp△q. This is exactly the\r
space Hdif f of diffeomorphism invariant states mentioned in the previous\r
subsection. A diffeomorphism invariant operator O is an operator for which\r
the centre part of the diagram (90) commute\r

This reflects the simple observation that a loop is, by itself, not an observable\r
since it is not self-adjoint. Only the combination L  L\r
\u00011\r
is self-adjoint,\r
exactly because it is invariant with respect to the symmetry group of the\r
loop."""

In Quantum Field Theory the vacuum state is defined as the unique trans\u0002lational invariant state. In the present setting there are certain states which\r
display a high degree of symmetry and which may be thought in terms of a\r
ground state.\r
Consider first the spectral triple pB, D, Hq and the two states\r
ψ0p∇q \u0010 ψ0pg1, g2, . . . , gn, . . .q \u0010 δG1\r
pidq \u0004 δG2pidq \u0004 . . . \u0004 δGnpidq \u0004 . . . ,\r
and\r
φ0p∇q \u0010 1 .\r
Here δGnis the delta-function on the n’th copy of G and c is a constant. The\r
action of a loop L on the first state reads\r
fL \u0004 ψ0p∇q \u0010 ψ0p∇q\r
for any L in B. This means that the entire algebra B collapses into the\r
identity on the state ψ0. This corresponds to flat space. This state, however,\r
does not lie in the Hilbert space, nor in the domain of the operator D. In\r
contrast to this the state φ0 lies in the kernel of D. Both states ψ0 are\r
invariant under diffp△q since they are invariant under any permutation of\r
the argument pg1, . . . , gn, . . .q.\r
If we consider instead the spectral triple pBt, Dt, Htq there are again two\r
states which are highly symmetric. Consider first\r
Ht Q Ψ0p∇, x¯q \u0010 ψ0p∇q b ξopx¯q ,\r
where\r
ξ0px¯q \u0010 ξ0px1, x2, . . . , xn, . . .q \u0010 δx1\r
pα1q \u0004 δx2pα2q \u0004 . . . \u0004 δxnpαnq \u0004 . . .\r
This state fixes the sequence taiu on the ’background’ sequence tαiu which\r
was, in section 9.5, fixed according to relation (85). Again, this states does\r
not lie in the domain of the Dirac operator Dt. Notice however, that by\r
choosing the parameters ai’s according to relation (85) one obtains a Dirac\r
type operator D which is, up to an overall factor, invariant under a shift in\r
the parameters ai. Such a shift corresponds to a change of scale.\r
Next, we may also consider the state\r
Ht Q Φ0p∇, x¯q \u0010 φ0p∇q b ηopx¯q ,\r
80

where\r
η0px¯q \u0010 φ1px1q \u0004 φ2px2q \u0004 . . . \u0004 φnpxnq \u0004 . . .\r
Here φnpxnq is the Gauss distribution which we used to construct the triple\r
pBt, Dt, Htq. Since the state η0 lies in the kernel of Da the state Φ0 lies in\r
the kernel of Dt.\r
