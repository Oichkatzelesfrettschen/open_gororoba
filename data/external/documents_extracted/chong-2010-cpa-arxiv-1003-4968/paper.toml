We show that an arbitrary body or aggregate can be made perfectly absorbing at discrete frequen\u0002cies if a precise amount of dissipation is added under specific conditions of coherent monochromatic\r
illumination. This effect arises from the interaction of optical absorption and wave interference, and\r
corresponds to moving a zero of the elastic S-matrix onto the real wavevector axis. It is thus the\r
time-reversed process of lasing at threshold. The effect is demonstrated in a simple Si slab geometry\r
illuminated in the 500 − 900nm range. Coherent perfect absorbers are novel linear optical elements,\r
absorptive interferometers, which may be useful for controlled optical energy transfer.\r
PACS numbers: 42.25.Bs, 42.25.Hz, 42.55.Ah\r
A laser is a physical system which, when subjected\r
to an energy flux (pump), self-organizes at a threshold\r
value of the pump to produce narrow-band coherent elec\u0002tromagnetic radiation. In the absence of inhomogeneous\r
broadening and quantum fluctuations, this radiation has\r
zero linewidth. Above the first lasing threshold, lasers are\r
non-linear systems, but at the first threshold they satisfy\r
a linear wave equation with a negative (amplifying) imag\u0002inary part of the refractive index, generated by the pop\u0002ulation inversion due to the pump [1]. In conventional\r
lasers, the gain medium is confined in relatively high\r
quality-factor (high-Q) resonators, and the lasing modes\r
are closely related to passive-cavity modes. However, re\u0002cent demonstrations of random lasers [2, 3] have shown\r
that the lasing threshold can be reached and coherent las\u0002ing obtained in resonators with no high-Q passive-cavity\r
modes. It can be rigorously shown within semiclassical\r
laser theory that the first lasing mode in any cavity is an\r
eigenvector of the electromagnetic scattering matrix (S\u0002matrix) with infinite eigenvalue; i.e. lasing occurs when\r
a pole of the S-matrix is pulled “up” to the real axis by\r
including gain as a negative imaginary part of the refrac\u0002tive index [4]. This viewpoint suggests the possibility of\r
the time-reversed process of lasing at threshold [5, 6]. A\r
specific degree of dissipation is added to the medium, cor\u0002responding to a positive imaginary refractive index equal\r
in absolute value to that at the lasing threshold. The sys\u0002tem is illuminated coherently and monochromatically by\r
the time-reverse of the output of a lasing mode, and the\r
incident radiation is perfectly absorbed. We refer to such\r
an optical system as a coherent perfect absorber (CPA).\r
Coherent perfect absorption is a general and robust\r
phenomenon related to the analytic properties of the S\u0002matrix. For simplicity, we consider scattering in one or\r
two dimensions, for which the electric field (in the TM\r
polarization) is a scalar obeying the Helmholtz equation:\r
\u0002\r
∇2 + n\r
2\r
(~r) k\r
2\r
\u0003\r
φ(~r) = 0. (1)\r
Here k = ω/c (a scalar), ω is the frequency, and n =\r
n\r
0 + in00 is the complex refractive index, with n00 < 0 for\r
gain and n\r
00 > 0 for absorption. There is an “external\r
region”, extending from some radius rs to infinity, where\r
n = 1 (the following discussion can be extended straight\u0002forwardly to the case of an external dielectric n0). The\r
field in the external region is a combination of incoming\r
waves ψ\r

, r > rs. (2)\r
The scattering channel amplitudes are related by\r
P\r
m0 Smm0 (k) αm0 = βm. With n\r
00 = 0 (lossless\r
medium), S(k) is unitary for real k. Continuing k\r
into the complex plane, S(k) possesses a countably in\u0002finite set of poles and zeros, symmetrically placed at\r
{k\r
∓\r
m = qm ∓ iγm}, where γm > 0.\r
When we add gain or dissipation, the zeros and poles\r
of S(k) flow in the complex k plane, but they cannot\r
simply appear or disappear, because arg [det(S)] always\r
winds by 2π around each zero and −2π around each pole.\r
(We ignore pair creation and annihilation of zeros and\r
poles, which normally does not occur.) Typically, adding\r
dissipation moves the zeros down, and when there is suf\u0002ficient dissipation a zero can cross the real axis at some\r
specific value of the wavevector, ˜km. We parameterize\r
the dissipation by the imaginary part of the refractive\r
index, Im{nm} = n\r
00\r
m > 0, and refer to the discrete\r
pairs {(\r
˜km, n00\r
m)} as the CPA zeros. Radiation incident at\r
each ˜km can be completely absorbed if it corresponds to\r
the specific eigenvector of the S-matrix having eigenvalue\r
zero. For homogeneous bodies such purely-incoming,\r
real-k radiation modes are the complex conjugate of the\r
constant-flux states first proposed by Kapur and Peierls\r
[7], and recently introduced into semiclassical laser the\u0002ory by T¨ureci et. al. [8]. We wish to emphasize that\r
the CPA zeros are distinct from absorption resonances\r
of the atomic or molecular medium, which do not re\u0002quire specific illumination conditions. The CPA process\r
arises from the interplay of interference and absorption:\r
in the presence of specific amounts of dissipation, there\r
exist interference patterns that trap the incident radia\u0002tion for an infinite time. Even small rates of single-pass\r
absorption can lead to perfect absorption, and hence me\u0002dia that normally do not absorb radiation well at certain\r
frequencies can be made to do so, albeit within narrow\r

below, with a simple realizable CPA in Si (silicon). Fi\u0002nally, just as absorption can be enhanced by interference,\r
we show that it can also be reduced by illuminating the\r
CPA with eigenvectors of the S-matrix with constructive\r
interference for escape.\r
Before moving to specific examples, we discuss a gen\u0002eral framework for finding CPA zeros based on the “R\u0002matrix” theory of Wigner and Eisenbud [9]. In this ap\u0002proach, the S-matrix is given by\r
S(k) = −e\r
2ikr0\r
[I − ikR(k)]−1[I + ikR(k)] , (3)\r
where r0 > rs is an arbitrarily-chosen boundary far from\r
the origin, and R(k) (the R-matrix) takes the form\r

where φ\r
m\r
α ∈ R is the α-th Wigner-Eisenbud basis\r
function evaluated at r = r0 and decomposed into\r
the m-th channel [10], while kα ∈ R is the eigen\u0002value of that basis function. The dissipation matrix,\r
γαα0 =\r

)(~r) φα(~r) φα0 (~r), is real and positive\u0002definite.\r
When Q \u001D 1, each S-matrix zero/pole is determined\r
by approximating the R-matrix by a single term α; in\r
this case the zeros and poles of the S-matrix occur at\r
(1 + iγαα) k\r
2 ∓ iϕα k − k2\r
α = 0, (6)\r
where ϕα =\r
P\r

parts, as already noted. Furthermore, zeros cross the real\r
axis exactly when γαα = ϕα/kα, at frequency k = kα.\r

prediction, even though the cavity only has Q ∼ 30.\r
The simplest possible CPA is a single port reflector,\r
similar to the “critically-coupled fiber-resonator” sys\u0002tems widely studied in integrated optics [11–13]. How\u0002ever, important properties of the CPA are only revealed\r
when there are multiple input ports and hence non-trivial\r
eigenvectors. We therefore study a two-port case to illus\u0002trate the concept fully. Consider a finite one-dimensional\r
slab of thickness a and uniform refractive index n, with\r
two input channels for each k corresponding to incident\r
radiation from left and right. It is straightforward to cal\u0002culate the 2 × 2 S-matrix for arbitrary complex index n,\r
and to show that it has a zero eigenvalue when\r

material has a frequency-dependent n(k), and when the\r
material is fabricated and illuminated in a 2-port configu\u0002ration, one may realize a CPA by scanning k and looking\r
for coincidences, i.e. n(k) ≈ nν(k) for some integers ν.\r
In an indirect bandgap semiconductor such as Si, n\r
00\r
increases smoothly from very small values as k increases\r
past the bandgap, while n\r

changes little [14]. For fre\u0002quencies near the bandgap, ∂n00/∂k \u001D ∂n00\r
ν /∂k and\r
∂n0/∂k \u001C ∂n0\r
ν/∂k; thus it is possible to vary k so as to\r
pass very close to several CPA zeros. Like a bound state,\r
a CPA zero has no intrinsic width; the scattered inten\u0002sity near a CPA zero is Imin ∼ c0|n(k) − nν(k)|\r
2\r
, where\r
c0 is of order unity (neglecting the spectral width of the\r
incident radiation). Fig. 3 shows the S-matrix eigenvalue\r
intensities for a slab of undoped Si, with a = 100 µm.\r

neighborhood of λ = 945nm, with a maximum intensity\r
contrast ∼ 50 dB, and more than ten substantial minima\r
are visible in the range 938nm < λ < 954nm. Due to\r
the mirror symmetry of the uniform slab, the two eigen\u0002modes are parity eigenstates. The ± in Eq. (7) deter\u0002mines whether the perfect-absorber condition is satisfied\r
by the symmetric or antisymmetric mode. The location\r
of these minima is a-dependent and hence tunable within\r
a given material; we can derive a tight lower bound for\r

which goes to zero at the n values given in (7) and locates\r
the interesting operating regions. For Si, the optimal\r
wavelength occurs at around 750 nm for a = 10 µm,\r
and around 1000 nm for a = 150 µm; the exact value\r
depends on n(k), which in turn depends on the doping. If\r
a & 50µm, the spacing between CPA zeros, given in (8),\r
becomes small, and the material index always passes close\r
to one or more of them without fine-tuning a, making the\r
behavior shown in Fig. 3 robust. Simulations of CPAs of\r
this type for other indirect bandgap semiconductors such\r
as GaP show similarly good results.\r
Perfect absorption occurs only under the correct coher\u0002ent two-channel illumination conditions, corresponding\r
to the eigenvector of the S-matrix with eigenvalue zero.\r
The effect arises from a combination of interference and\r
dissipation: the reflected part of the first incident beam\r
interferes destructively with the transmitted part of the\r
second incident beam, and vice versa, and therefore the\r
radiation is trapped in an interference pattern within the\r
slab and lost entirely to dissipation. One sees from Fig. 3\r
that the other, orthogonal eigenmode has maximal |s|\r
2\r
,\r
and in fact the material absorbs significantly less energy\r
than if it is incoherently illuminated from both sides. In\r
this mode, the reflected part of each beam interferes con\u0002structively with the transmitted part of the other beam,\r
causing the radiation to escape the slab more quickly\r
than in the incoherent case.\r
To illustrate the role of interference in the CPA, we\r
write down the transfer matrix, a 2 × 2 matrix with unit\r
determinant:\r
T(n, k) = 1\r
t\r
\u0014\r
t\r
2 − r2\r
r\r
−r 1\r
\u0015\r
, (11)\r
where r(n, k) and t(n, k) are the reflection and trans\u0002mission amplitudes for a single wave of unit amplitude\r
incident from either direction. Perfect absorption occurs\r
when T11 = 0, i.e. when r\r
2 = t2\r
. (Furthermore, we can\r
show that the non-zero eigenvalue, corresponding to the\r
minimally-absorbed mode, is 2t.) In order for the two\r
output beams to interfere destructively in the manner\r
described above, not only must they have equal intensi\u0002ties (|r|\r
2 = |t|2\r
), they must also have the correct rela\u0002tive phase. This is impossible to satisfy when n is real,\r
as expected from energy conservation. In the T-matrix\r
analysis, this property is based on the impossibility of\r
establishing the correct interference pattern; when n is\r
real, T\r
∗ = T−1\r
, and consequently (11) implies that even\r
if we achieve the condition |r|\r
2 = |t|2\r
, there is always a\r
±π/2 phase difference between r and t, so r\r
2 6= t2\r
.\r
The above analysis applies to any 2-port system with\r
mirror symmetry in the index variation. It can be ex\u0002tended to arbitrary 2-port systems, for which the general\r
transfer matrix has the form\r
T =\r
1\r
t\r
\u0014\r
t\r
2 − r`rr rr\r
−r` 1\r
\u0015\r
, (12)\r
where r` and rr are the reflection amplitudes for a wave\r
of unit amplitude incident from either the left and right\r
respectively, and t is the transmission amplitude for ei\u0002ther direction of incidence. Then the perfect absorption

4\r
condition can be written as r`rr = t\r
2\r
, and again this\r
cannot be satisfied if the refractive indices are all real.\r
One interesting property of the mirror-symmetric sys\u0002tem is that we can change the output intensity simply\r
by changing the relative phase of the input beams. For a\r
phase-modulated input, [1, ±e\r
iφ], the output intensities\r
are equal in each channel, with the form\r
I = I0 sin2\r
\u0012\r
φ\r
2\r
\u0013\r
. (13)\r
For the uniform slab, I0 = |(n\r
2 − 1)/(n2 + 1)|2\r
, where n\r
is the special refractive index satisfying (7). The mirror\u0002symmetric CPA therefore functions as a compact absorb\u0002ing interferometer. Unlike an ordinary interferometer, it\r
does not deflect the input beams into another output\r
channel, but causes it to be absorbed entirely within the\r
material. The CPA may therefore be good for applica\u0002tions in which optical energy needs to be delivered to a\r
device in a precise pulse shape or sequence, which could\r
be controlled by modulating the relative beam phase in\r
Eq. (13). Once the CPA has absorbed energy, it must\r
flow out in some manner, e.g. as heat or as fluores\u0002cence, the latter being less likely to be useful or desir\u0002able. Hence direct bandgap materials, such as GaAs,\r
which make good lasers, make poor CPAs since much of\r
the absorbed light will be re-radiated. In contrast, in\u0002direct bandgap systems such as Si, which are difficult to\r
make into lasers, retain the energy as heat or as electron\u0002hole pairs, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic response\r
as CPAs. We emphasize however that if the incident ra\u0002diation is broadband, then the response averages out to\r
approximately the incoherent result, due to the oscilla\u0002tion of the absorption in Fig. 3.\r
In applications it will often be useful to have a large\r
contrast between the perfectly absorbed and incoherent\r
or reduced absorption illumination conditions. Accord\u0002ing to (13), the intensity contrast between the maximally\r
and minimally absorbing eigenmodes in a uniform slab\r
is limited by n. For the Si slab of Fig. 3, the contrast is\r
∼ 0.75. (In particular, I0 < 1 for all n, because some field\r
is always present in the absorbing material.) It is possi\u0002ble to increase the contrast with a non-uniform system,\r
such as a periodic array of slabs (i.e., a distributed Bragg\r
reflector or one-dimensional photonic crystal). One such\r
system, consisting of Si and non-absorbing SiO2 slabs,\r
is shown in Fig. 4. It exhibits a much larger absorption\r
contrast than the uniform slab: the S-matrix eigenval\u0002ues at the 956 nm absorption resonance have intensities\r
|s1|\r
2 = 5×10−4\r
(symmetric) and |s2|\r
2 = 0.988 (antisym\u0002metric). The absorption in the antisymmetric mode is\r
exceptionally low because the field inside the slab is con\u0002centrated in the SiO2 regions, which are non-absorbing.\r
Finally, we note the CPA is probably easiest to real\u0002ize in a waveguide geometry, where it is relatively easy\r
to control individual mode amplitudes. In a free-space\r
geometry, it may be challenging to generate the input\r

Coherent Perfect Absorbers: Time-reversed Lasers\r
Y. D. Chong,∗ Li Ge, Hui Cao, and A. D. Stone\r
Department of Applied Physics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520\r
We show that an arbitrary body or aggregate can be made perfectly absorbing at discrete frequen\u0002cies if a precise amount of dissipation is added under specific conditions of coherent monochromatic\r
illumination. This effect arises from the interaction of optical absorption and wave interference, and\r
corresponds to moving a zero of the elastic S-matrix onto the real wavevector axis. It is thus the\r
time-reversed process of lasing at threshold. The effect is demonstrated in a simple Si slab geometry\r
illuminated in the 500 − 900nm range. Coherent perfect absorbers are novel linear optical elements,\r
absorptive interferometers, which may be useful for controlled optical energy transfer.\r

A laser is a physical system which, when subjected\r
to an energy flux (pump), self-organizes at a threshold\r
value of the pump to produce narrow-band coherent elec\u0002tromagnetic radiation. In the absence of inhomogeneous\r
broadening and quantum fluctuations, this radiation has\r
zero linewidth. Above the first lasing threshold, lasers are\r
non-linear systems, but at the first threshold they satisfy\r
a linear wave equation with a negative (amplifying) imag\u0002inary part of the refractive index, generated by the pop\u0002ulation inversion due to the pump [1]. In conventional\r
lasers, the gain medium is confined in relatively high\r
quality-factor (high-Q) resonators, and the lasing modes\r
are closely related to passive-cavity modes. However, re\u0002cent demonstrations of random lasers [2, 3] have shown\r
that the lasing threshold can be reached and coherent las\u0002ing obtained in resonators with no high-Q passive-cavity\r
modes. It can be rigorously shown within semiclassical\r
laser theory that the first lasing mode in any cavity is an\r
eigenvector of the electromagnetic scattering matrix (S\u0002matrix) with infinite eigenvalue; i.e. lasing occurs when\r
a pole of the S-matrix is pulled “up” to the real axis by\r
including gain as a negative imaginary part of the refrac\u0002tive index [4]. This viewpoint suggests the possibility of\r
the time-reversed process of lasing at threshold [5, 6]. A\r
specific degree of dissipation is added to the medium, cor\u0002responding to a positive imaginary refractive index equal\r
in absolute value to that at the lasing threshold. The sys\u0002tem is illuminated coherently and monochromatically by\r
the time-reverse of the output of a lasing mode, and the\r
incident radiation is perfectly absorbed. We refer to such\r
an optical system as a coherent perfect absorber (CPA).\r
Coherent perfect absorption is a general and robust\r
phenomenon related to the analytic properties of the S\u0002matrix. For simplicity, we consider scattering in one or\r
two dimensions, for which the electric field (in the TM\r
polarization) is a scalar obeying the Helmholtz equation:\r

Here k = ω/c (a scalar), ω is the frequency, and n =\r
n\r
0 + in00 is the complex refractive index, with n00 < 0 for\r
gain and n\r
00 > 0 for absorption. There is an “external\r
region”, extending from some radius rs to infinity, where\r
n = 1 (the following discussion can be extended straight\u0002forwardly to the case of an external dielectric n0). The\r
field in the external region is a combination of incoming\r

The scattering channel amplitudes are related by\r
P\r
m0 Smm0 (k) αm0 = βm. With n\r
00 = 0 (lossless\r
medium), S(k) is unitary for real k. Continuing k\r
into the complex plane, S(k) possesses a countably in\u0002finite set of poles and zeros, symmetrically placed at\r
{k\r
∓\r
m = qm ∓ iγm}, where γm > 0.\r
When we add gain or dissipation, the zeros and poles\r
of S(k) flow in the complex k plane, but they cannot\r
simply appear or disappear, because arg [det(S)] always\r
winds by 2π around each zero and −2π around each pole.\r
(We ignore pair creation and annihilation of zeros and\r
poles, which normally does not occur.) Typically, adding\r
dissipation moves the zeros down, and when there is suf\u0002ficient dissipation a zero can cross the real axis at some\r
specific value of the wavevector, ˜km. We parameterize\r
the dissipation by the imaginary part of the refractive\r
index, Im{nm} = n\r
00\r
m > 0, and refer to the discrete\r
pairs {(\r
˜km, n00\r
m)} as the CPA zeros. Radiation incident at\r
each ˜km can be completely absorbed if it corresponds to\r
the specific eigenvector of the S-matrix having eigenvalue\r
zero. For homogeneous bodies such purely-incoming,\r
real-k radiation modes are the complex conjugate of the\r
constant-flux states first proposed by Kapur and Peierls\r
[7], and recently introduced into semiclassical laser the\u0002ory by T¨ureci et. al. [8]. We wish to emphasize that\r
the CPA zeros are distinct from absorption resonances\r
of the atomic or molecular medium, which do not re\u0002quire specific illumination conditions. The CPA process\r
arises from the interplay of interference and absorption:\r
in the presence of specific amounts of dissipation, there\r
exist interference patterns that trap the incident radia\u0002tion for an infinite time. Even small rates of single-pass\r
absorption can lead to perfect absorption, and hence me\u0002dia that normally do not absorb radiation well at certain\r
frequencies can be made to do so, albeit within narrow\r

below, with a simple realizable CPA in Si (silicon). Fi\u0002nally, just as absorption can be enhanced by interference,\r
we show that it can also be reduced by illuminating the\r
CPA with eigenvectors of the S-matrix with constructive\r
interference for escape.\r
Before moving to specific examples, we discuss a gen\u0002eral framework for finding CPA zeros based on the “R\u0002matrix” theory of Wigner and Eisenbud [9]. In this ap\u0002proach, the S-matrix is given by\r
S(k) = −e\r
2ikr0\r
[I − ikR(k)]−1[I + ikR(k)] , (3)\r
where r0 > rs is an arbitrarily-chosen boundary far from\r
the origin, and R(k) (the R-matrix) takes the form\r

α ∈ R is the α-th Wigner-Eisenbud basis\r
function evaluated at r = r0 and decomposed into\r
the m-th channel [10], while kα ∈ R is the eigen\u0002value of that basis function. The dissipation matrix,\r

When Q \u001D 1, each S-matrix zero/pole is determined\r
by approximating the R-matrix by a single term α; in\r
this case the zeros and poles of the S-matrix occur at\r

The simplest possible CPA is a single port reflector,\r
similar to the “critically-coupled fiber-resonator” sys\u0002tems widely studied in integrated optics [11–13]. How\u0002ever, important properties of the CPA are only revealed\r
when there are multiple input ports and hence non-trivial\r
eigenvectors. We therefore study a two-port case to illus\u0002trate the concept fully. Consider a finite one-dimensional\r

two input channels for each k corresponding to incident\r

material has a frequency-dependent n(k), and when the\r
material is fabricated and illuminated in a 2-port configu\u0002ration, one may realize a CPA by scanning k and looking\r
for coincidences, i.e. n(k) ≈ nν(k) for some integers ν.\r
In an indirect bandgap semiconductor such as Si, n\r
00\r
increases smoothly from very small values as k increases\r
past the bandgap, while n\r

changes little [14]. For fre\u0002quencies near the bandgap, ∂n00/∂k \u001D ∂n00\r
ν /∂k and\r
∂n0/∂k \u001C ∂n0\r
ν/∂k; thus it is possible to vary k so as to\r
pass very close to several CPA zeros. Like a bound state,\r
a CPA zero has no intrinsic width; the scattered inten\u0002sity near a CPA zero is Imin ∼ c0|n(k) − nν(k)|\r
2\r
, where\r
c0 is of order unity (neglecting the spectral width of the\r
incident radiation). Fig. 3 shows the S-matrix eigenvalue\r
intensities for a slab of undoped Si, with a = 100 µm.\r

neighborhood of λ = 945nm, with a maximum intensity\r
contrast ∼ 50 dB, and more than ten substantial minima\r
are visible in the range 938nm < λ < 954nm. Due to\r
the mirror symmetry of the uniform slab, the two eigen\u0002modes are parity eigenstates. The ± in Eq. (7) deter\u0002mines whether the perfect-absorber condition is satisfied\r
by the symmetric or antisymmetric mode. The location\r
of these minima is a-dependent and hence tunable within\r
a given material; we can derive a tight lower bound for\r

which goes to zero at the n values given in (7) and locates\r
the interesting operating regions. For Si, the optimal\r
wavelength occurs at around 750 nm for a = 10 µm,\r
and around 1000 nm for a = 150 µm; the exact value\r
depends on n(k), which in turn depends on the doping. If\r
a & 50µm, the spacing between CPA zeros, given in (8),\r
becomes small, and the material index always passes close\r
to one or more of them without fine-tuning a, making the\r
behavior shown in Fig. 3 robust. Simulations of CPAs of\r
this type for other indirect bandgap semiconductors such\r
as GaP show similarly good results.\r
Perfect absorption occurs only under the correct coher\u0002ent two-channel illumination conditions, corresponding\r
to the eigenvector of the S-matrix with eigenvalue zero.\r
The effect arises from a combination of interference and\r
dissipation: the reflected part of the first incident beam\r
interferes destructively with the transmitted part of the\r
second incident beam, and vice versa, and therefore the\r
radiation is trapped in an interference pattern within the\r
slab and lost entirely to dissipation. One sees from Fig. 3\r
that the other, orthogonal eigenmode has maximal |s|\r
2\r
,\r
and in fact the material absorbs significantly less energy\r
than if it is incoherently illuminated from both sides. In\r
this mode, the reflected part of each beam interferes con\u0002structively with the transmitted part of the other beam,\r
causing the radiation to escape the slab more quickly\r
than in the incoherent case.\r
To illustrate the role of interference in the CPA, we\r
write down the transfer matrix, a 2 × 2 matrix with unit\r
determinant:\r
T(n, k) = 1\r
t\r
\u0014\r
t\r
2 − r2\r
r\r
−r 1\r
\u0015\r
, (11)\r
where r(n, k) and t(n, k) are the reflection and trans\u0002mission amplitudes for a single wave of unit amplitude\r
incident from either direction. Perfect absorption occurs\r
when T11 = 0, i.e. when r\r
2 = t2\r
. (Furthermore, we can\r
show that the non-zero eigenvalue, corresponding to the\r
minimally-absorbed mode, is 2t.) In order for the two\r
output beams to interfere destructively in the manner\r
described above, not only must they have equal intensi\u0002ties (|r|\r
2 = |t|2\r
), they must also have the correct rela\u0002tive phase. This is impossible to satisfy when n is real,\r
as expected from energy conservation. In the T-matrix\r
analysis, this property is based on the impossibility of\r
establishing the correct interference pattern; when n is\r
real, T\r
∗ = T−1\r
, and consequently (11) implies that even\r
if we achieve the condition |r|\r
2 = |t|2\r
, there is always a\r
±π/2 phase difference between r and t, so r\r
2 6= t2\r
.\r
The above analysis applies to any 2-port system with\r
mirror symmetry in the index variation. It can be ex\u0002tended to arbitrary 2-port systems, for which the general\r
transfer matrix has the form\r
T =\r
1\r
t\r
\u0014\r
t\r
2 − r`rr rr\r
−r` 1\r
\u0015\r
, (12)\r
where r` and rr are the reflection amplitudes for a wave\r
of unit amplitude incident from either the left and right\r
respectively, and t is the transmission amplitude for ei\u0002ther direction of incidence. Then the perfect absorption

4\r
condition can be written as r`rr = t\r
2\r
, and again this\r
cannot be satisfied if the refractive indices are all real.\r
One interesting property of the mirror-symmetric sys\u0002tem is that we can change the output intensity simply\r
by changing the relative phase of the input beams. For a\r
phase-modulated input, [1, ±e\r
iφ], the output intensities\r
are equal in each channel, with the form\r
I = I0 sin2\r
\u0012\r
φ\r
2\r
\u0013\r
. (13)\r
For the uniform slab, I0 = |(n\r
2 − 1)/(n2 + 1)|2\r
, where n\r
is the special refractive index satisfying (7). The mirror\u0002symmetric CPA therefore functions as a compact absorb\u0002ing interferometer. Unlike an ordinary interferometer, it\r
does not deflect the input beams into another output\r
channel, but causes it to be absorbed entirely within the\r
material. The CPA may therefore be good for applica\u0002tions in which optical energy needs to be delivered to a\r
device in a precise pulse shape or sequence, which could\r
be controlled by modulating the relative beam phase in\r
Eq. (13). Once the CPA has absorbed energy, it must\r
flow out in some manner, e.g. as heat or as fluores\u0002cence, the latter being less likely to be useful or desir\u0002able. Hence direct bandgap materials, such as GaAs,\r
which make good lasers, make poor CPAs since much of\r
the absorbed light will be re-radiated. In contrast, in\u0002direct bandgap systems such as Si, which are difficult to\r
make into lasers, retain the energy as heat or as electron\u0002hole pairs, leading to an enhanced photovoltaic response\r
as CPAs. We emphasize however that if the incident ra\u0002diation is broadband, then the response averages out to\r
approximately the incoherent result, due to the oscilla\u0002tion of the absorption in Fig. 3.\r
In applications it will often be useful to have a large\r
contrast between the perfectly absorbed and incoherent\r
or reduced absorption illumination conditions. Accord\u0002ing to (13), the intensity contrast between the maximally\r
and minimally absorbing eigenmodes in a uniform slab\r
is limited by n. For the Si slab of Fig. 3, the contrast is\r
∼ 0.75. (In particular, I0 < 1 for all n, because some field\r
is always present in the absorbing material.) It is possi\u0002ble to increase the contrast with a non-uniform system,\r
such as a periodic array of slabs (i.e., a distributed Bragg\r
reflector or one-dimensional photonic crystal). One such\r
system, consisting of Si and non-absorbing SiO2 slabs,\r
is shown in Fig. 4. It exhibits a much larger absorption\r
contrast than the uniform slab: the S-matrix eigenval\u0002ues at the 956 nm absorption resonance have intensities\r
|s1|\r
2 = 5×10−4\r
(symmetric) and |s2|\r
2 = 0.988 (antisym\u0002metric). The absorption in the antisymmetric mode is\r
exceptionally low because the field inside the slab is con\u0002centrated in the SiO2 regions, which are non-absorbing.\r
Finally, we note the CPA is probably easiest to real\u0002ize in a waveguide geometry, where it is relatively easy\r
to control individual mode amplitudes. In a free-space\r
geometry, it may be challenging to generate the input\r
