Lorentz symmetry\r
A search for violation of Lorentz invariance in the production of top quark pairs (tt) is presented. The measured\r
normalized differential tt production cross section, as a function of the sidereal time, is examined for potential\r
modulations induced by Lorentz-invariance breaking operators in an effective field theory extension of the\r
standard model (SM). The cross section is measured from collision events collected by the CMS detector at a\r
center-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1, and containing one\r
electron and one muon. The results are found to be compatible with zero, in agreement with the SM, and are\r
used to place upper limits at 68% confidence level on the magnitude of the Lorentz-violating couplings ranging\r
from 1–8 × 10−3. This is the first precision test of the isotropy in special relativity with top quarks at the LHC,\r
restricting further the bounds on such couplings by up to two orders of magnitude with respect to previous\r
searches conducted at the Tevatron.\r
1. Introduction\r
Lorentz invariance is a key ingredient of the relativistic description\r
of our world, on the scale of elementary particles as well as on large\r
scales in the Universe. The standard model (SM) of particle physics\r
is a relativistic quantum field theory, and as such it must contain a\r
Lorentz-invariant action. General relativity preserves Lorentz invariance\r
locally. The Lorentz group contains rotations and boosts in Minkowski\r
spacetime. Models of quantum gravity, e.g., string theory [1] and loop\r
quantum gravity [2], can, however, predict breaking of Lorentz invari\u0002ance at a high mass scale. A quantum theory including gravity may be\r
governed by an energy scale lower than the Planck mass, possibly at the\r
TeV scale [3]. Thus, induced deviations from Lorentz invariance may be\r
measurable at the LHC.\r
The standard model extension (SME) [4,5] is an effective field the\u0002ory in which all operators violating Lorentz invariance are added to the\r
SM Lagrangian. Its coefficients, controlling the size of Lorentz invari\u0002ance breaking, are different for each particle. While coefficients related\r
to photons, neutrons, protons, and neutrinos have been measured pre\u0002cisely [6], the quark sector remains constrained at a relatively lower\r
precision. The ZEUS Collaboration at the DESY HERA recently searched\r
for violation of Lorentz invariance arising from light quarks in deep\r
inelastic scattering data [7]. Searches for Lorentz invariance violation\r
were performed in neutral meson mixing at KLOE [8], KTeV [9], FO-\r
⋆ E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch.\r
CUS [10], BaBar [11], D0 [12], and LHCb [13]. Violation of Lorentz\r
invariance was searched for with top quark pairs (tt) by the D0 ex\u0002periment [14] at the Fermilab Tevatron, showing compatibility with\r
Lorentz invariance with an absolute uncertainty of about 10% on the\r
tested SME coefficients. The proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN\r
LHC at √𝑠 = 13 TeV produce tt events with a cross section approxi\u0002mately 100 times higher than that of the Tevatron. Studies showed that\r
the measurements at the LHC have a large potential to significantly im\u0002prove upon existing results [15].\r
In this Letter, the first search for Lorentz invariance violation with\r
top quarks at the LHC is presented, within the context of the SME.\r
Signatures for violation of Lorentz invariance involving top quarks are\r
parameterized with the SME Lagrangian [16]:\r

where 𝜓 and 𝜓̄ are the Dirac fields for top quarks and antiquarks, 𝑚t\r

transformations of the particle system: they are constant 4×4 matrices,\r
thereby breaking Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian. They indicate\r
a preferential direction in spacetime as seen by top quarks, violating\r
the isotropy of special relativity. Boosts associated with the Earth’s ro\u0002tation and with the revolution around the sun are negligible relative to\r

The CMS Collaboration\r
top quark boosts. Lorentz invariance is preserved when 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 are\r
zero.\r
Choosing a reference frame is needed to report measurements of\r
Lorentz-violating coefficients, in analogy, for instance, with the mea\u0002surement of particle energies, which are not invariant under Lorentz\r
transformation. By convention, results are reported in the sun-centered\r
frame (SCF) [6], with its origin at the center of the sun; the 𝑍 axis\r
pointing north, parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis; the 𝑋 axis pointing\r
to the intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator on January 1st,\r
2000 (J2000); and the 𝑌 axis completing the direct basis. The SCF can be\r
considered as inertial in the lifetime of a physics experiment. Hereafter,\r
the coefficients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 with space-time indices 𝜇 or 𝜈 = 𝑇 ,𝑋, 𝑌 ,𝑍\r
are expressed in the SCF (to be distinguished from the space-time indices\r
of the CMS frame). The relevant measure of time in this reference frame\r
is called sidereal time. While one rotation period of the Earth is equal\r
to approximately 23 h 56 min UTC (i.e., Universal Time Coordinated,\r
where UTC seconds are defined from Cesium atomic hyperfine transi\u0002tions), one rotation period is defined as being equal to 24 sidereal hours.\r
The CMS detector moves around the Earth’s rotation axis during a side\u0002real day, and so does the beam line direction at the interaction point,\r
or the average direction of top quarks produced in the collisions. As a\r
consequence, top quark couplings 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 depend on time, result\u0002ing in cross sections for top quark production modulating with sidereal\r
time. Searching for such signatures is the goal of this Letter.\r
We report a search for violation of Lorentz invariance in pp → tt pro\u0002duction with the CMS experiment at √𝑠 = 13 TeV, using events with one\r
muon and one electron of opposite charge in the final state, stemming\r
from the decay tt → bbeνeμνμ (where the particle or antiparticle nature\r
of the leptons is implied). The eμ channel provides a high purity sample\r
of tt events owing to the negligible contribution from Z+jets processes.\r
A data sample recorded in 2016–2017 with the CMS experiment and cor\u0002responding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 is analyzed. Events\r
are categorized based on the number of jets identified as originating\r
from b quarks (b jets) to improve the separation between the tt signal\r
and the background processes. The normalized tt cross section is mea\u0002sured differentially as a function of the sidereal time, in bins of hours\r
within the sidereal day, by performing a profile maximum likelihood fit\r
to the event yields in the b jet multiplicity. The measurement is used\r
to constrain, for the first time at the LHC, the Lorentz-violating coeffi\u0002cients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 impacting top quarks. Tabulated results are provided\r
in the HEPData record for this analysis [17].\r
The Letter is organized as follows. A description of the CMS detec\u0002tor and event reconstruction is provided in Section 2. Section 3 gives\r
details on simulation samples, and Section 4 describes the event selec\u0002tion. Event corrections and associated systematic uncertainties, as well\r
as their treatment relative to sidereal time, are detailed in Section 5. The\r
normalized differential cross section for tt production as a function of\r
sidereal time is measured in Section 6, providing a model-independent\r
result. Bounds on the coefficients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 within the SME frame\u0002work are extracted in Section 7. The Letter concludes with a Summary\r
in Section 8.\r
2. Event reconstruction with the CMS detector\r
The CMS apparatus [18–20] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic de\u0002tector, designed to trigger on [21,22] and identify electrons, muons,\r
photons, and hadrons [23–25]. A global “particle-flow” (PF) algo\u0002rithm [26] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, com\u0002bining information provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the\r
crystal electromagnetic (ECAL) and brass-scintillator hadron (HCAL)\r
calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with\r
data from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the flux\u0002return yoke outside the solenoid. The reconstructed particles are used\r
to build τ leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum [27–29]. A\r
more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a defini\u0002tion of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables,\r
can be found in Refs. [18–20].\r
Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. The\r
first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses infor\u0002mation from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at\r
a rate of around 100 kHz within a fixed latency of about 4 μs [21].\r
During the 2016–2017 data taking, a gradual shift in the timing of the\r
inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger in the region at |𝜂| > 2.0, where 𝜂 is the\r
pseudorapidity, caused a specific trigger inefficiency. Correction factors,\r
which are small, were computed from data and applied to the simula\u0002tion. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists\r
of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruc\u0002tion software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate\r
to around 1 kHz before data storage [22]. Events are selected at the HLT\r
by requiring the presence of one or two leptons, with transverse momen\u0002tum (𝑝T) thresholds as follows: one electron with 𝑝T > 12 GeV and one\r
muon with 𝑝T > 23 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 23 GeV and one muon\r
with 𝑝T > 8 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 27 (35) GeV in 2016 (2017);\r
or one muon with 𝑝T > 24 (27) GeV in 2016 (2017).\r
The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy mea\u0002surement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker.\r
Electron candidates are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 and 20 GeV for the\r
highest 𝑝T (leading) and second-highest 𝑝T (subleading) lepton. Fur\u0002thermore, electrons must have |𝜂| < 2.4, and their energy deposit in\r
the ECAL must lie outside of the transition region between the barrel\r
and endcap sections (1.44 < |𝜂| < 1.56). Electron candidates must satisfy\r
tight identification criteria and are required to be isolated in the detector\r
to reject jets misidentified as electrons. Identification criteria comprise\r
selections on a shower shape variable in the ECAL, on the matching of\r
the track with the ECAL energy deposit, on the ratio of HCAL over ECAL\r
energy deposits around the candidate, the hits in the inner tracker, and\r
on criteria to reject electrons arising from photon conversions [23]. An\r
isolation variable is computed with the PF algorithm asthe scalar 𝑝T sum\r
of photons, charged and neutral hadrons in a cone around the electron\r
direction. The cone is defined by Δ𝑅 =\r
√\r
(Δ𝜂)\r
2 + (Δ𝜙)2 < 0.3, where\r
Δ𝜂 and Δ𝜙 are the 𝜂 and azimuthal angle differences between the PF\r
particles and the electron, respectively. Contributions to the isolation\r
sum from other inelastic pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch\r
crossing (pileup) are corrected using the FastJet estimator [30]. The\r
relative isolation, calculated as the isolation sum divided by the electron\r
𝑝T, is used. Differences in reconstruction and identification efficiencies\r
between data and simulation are corrected using Z → e+e− events with\r
a “tag-and-probe” method [31].\r
Muons are measured in the range |𝜂| < 2.4, with detection planes\r
made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and\r
resistive-plate chambers. Muon candidates are reconstructed with the PF\r
algorithm. They are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 (20) GeV for the lead\u0002ing (subleading) lepton. Muon candidates are required to satisfy tight\r
identification and isolation criteria, to suppress contributions from jets\r
misidentified as muons. Identification criteria include selections on the\r
number of matched muon detector planes, hits in the pixel and tracker,\r
the 𝜒2 of the trajectory fit including tracking layers and muon detector\r
planes, and the transverse impact parameter of the track [24]. A relative\r
isolation variable is calculated with the PF algorithm similar to electrons\r
but with a cone size Δ𝑅 < 0.4. Differences in identification and isolation\r
efficiencies between data and simulation are corrected using Z → μ+μ−\r
events with the tag-and-probe method.\r
Jets are reconstructed from PF candidates, using the anti-𝑘T algo\u0002rithm with a distance parameter of 0.4 [30,32]. Jet momentum is de\u0002termined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and\r
is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5–10% of the true\r
momentum over the entire 𝑝T spectrum and detector acceptance. To\r
mitigate pileup contributions, tracks identified to be originating from\r
pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to cor\u0002rect for the remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived\r
from simulation studies so that the average measured energy of jets be-

The CMS Collaboration\r
comes identical to that of particle level jets. In situ measurements of\r
the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events\r
are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy\r
scale in data and simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [28].\r
Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets po\u0002tentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures.\r
Jets are selected if they satisfy 𝑝T > 30 GeV and |𝜂| < 2.4. Jets are not\r
considered if their distance Δ𝑅 from selected leptons is less than 0.4.\r
For the identification of b jets, a loose selection on the score of\r
the deepCSV algorithm, a deep-learning discriminant using secondary\r
vertex and lifetime information [33,34], is used. The identification effi\u0002ciency of b quark jets is about 84% with a probability of misidentifying\r
light-quark and gluon jets of 10%, estimated for b jet candidates with\r
𝑝T > 20 GeV in simulated tt events. Corrections for the difference in\r
identification efficiency of b jets and light jets between data and simu\u0002lation are computed as a function of the jet 𝑝T and 𝜂 and applied to all\r
jets in the event.\r
3. Simulation samples\r
Monte Carlo (MC) samples for tt production are generated at next-to\u0002leading order (NLO) in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)\r
with the powheg v2 [35] generator, interfaced with pythia 8 [36] for\r
simulating parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event. Re\u0002vision 3453 is used for all the MC samples generated with powheg,\r
while all of the simulation samples use pythia 8.226 (8.230) in 2016\r
(2017). The tt cross section is computed with the top++ v2.0 pro\u0002gram [37] at next-to-NLO (NNLO) and next-to-next-to-leading logarith\u0002mic accuracy. It has been observed that the top quark 𝑝T spectrum in\r
data is softer than the spectrum predicted in simulation [38–40]. Sim\u0002ulated events for tt production are therefore corrected for the ratio of\r
unfolded tt data over powheg predictions as a function of the top quark\r
and antiquark 𝑝T at parton level.\r
Since this analysis targets the tt final state with two charged leptons\r
of different flavors and at least one b jet, single top quark production\r
in association with a W boson (tW) constitutes the main background,\r
with one lepton each arising from the top quark and associated W boson\r
decay. Simulated samples of tW and 𝑡-channel single top quark produc\u0002tion are generated at NLO in pQCD with powheg v2. The cross sec\u0002tion for the tW channel is computed at approximate NNLO [41]. Other\r
backgrounds involving top quarks include 𝑠-channel single top quark\r
production and tt production in association with a vector boson (ttW\r
and ttZ, grouped together and denoted as ttV). Simulated samples for\r
these processes are generated at NLO with MadGraph5_amc@nlo [42]\r
(version 2.4.2 in 2016 and 2.6.0 in 2017 in all samples using Mad\u0002Graph5_amc@nlo) with additional jets using FxFx merging [43]. The\r
cross sections for single top 𝑡- and 𝑠-channel production are com\u0002puted with the hathor v2.1 program [44] at NLO accuracy. The cross\r
sections for ttW and ttZ processes are computed at NLO with Mad\u0002Graph5_amc@nlo generation [42]. In the simulated samples, a fixed\r
value of 𝑚t = 172.5 GeV is used. Diboson production samples (WW, WZ,\r
ZZ) are generated with pythia 8. The cross section for the WW pro\u0002cess is computed at NNLO [45], while the WZ and ZZ cross sections\r
are computed at NLO with mcfm [46] version 6.6. The W+jets and\r
Z+jets processes (grouped together and denoted as V+jets) are gen\u0002erated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo, at leading order (LO) matched\r
with additional jets using the MLM algorithm [47] or at NLO with ad\u0002ditional jets using FxFx merging. Cross sections for Z+jets and W+jets\r
processes are computed with fewz [48] version 3.1 at NNLO.\r
The underlying event is modeled with the CP5 tune [49] for all of the\r
simulated samples with 2017 detector conditions, and for the simulation\r
of tt and tW processes with 2016 detector conditions. The samples simu\u0002lated with 2016 detector conditions are using the CUETP8M1 tune [50]\r
for all other background processes. The parton distribution functions\r
(PDFs) used are the NNPDF3.1 NNLO set [51] for samples using the\r
CP5 tune, and NNPDF3.0 NNLO for samples using the CUETP8M1 tune.\r

The CMS detector response is simulated with the Geant4 toolkit\r
[52]. Data and simulation events are passed through the same CMS soft\u0002ware reconstruction chain. Pileup interactions generated with pythia\r
8 are added to the simulations, and the distribution in the number of\r
pileup interactions is corrected for each MC sample to reproduce the\r
numbers observed in data.\r
4. Event selection\r
Events with exactly one electron and one muon are selected. Events\r
are rejected if there are additional electrons or muons with 𝑝T > 20 GeV.\r
In addition, the invariant mass of the dilepton pair is required to satisfy\r
𝑚eμ > 20 GeV, to reduce contributions from low-mass resonances and\r
Drell–Yan τ pair production. Events with at least two jets are selected,\r
among which at least one must be identified as a b jet.\r
The distribution in the number of b jets is compared between data\r
and simulation in Fig. 1. The MC simulation of signal and backgrounds\r
provides a description of the data distribution in the number of b jets\r
agreeing within uncertainties. Inclusively, the event yields are 7.1%\r
(2016) and 2.7% (2017) lower in data than in simulation, as shown\r
in Table 1.\r
The distribution in the number of b jets is used as discriminant for the\r
signal extraction in Sections 6 and 7, since it provides clear separation\r
between the tt signal and the single top quark background, with the\r
latter having only one top quark decaying to bW, compared to two for\r
the signal process.\r
5. Treatment of the sidereal time dependence in corrections and\r
systematic uncertainties\r
The CMS data is recorded in UNIX time, whose seconds having the\r
same duration as UTC seconds. The UNIX timestamp of the events is\r
translated to sidereal time with the following formula:\r
Ωsidereal 𝑡sidereal = ΩUTC 𝑡UNIX + 𝜙UNIX + 𝜙longitude, (2)\r
where Ωsidereal = 2𝜋∕86 400 s−1 (sidereal) is the angular velocity of\r
Earth’s rotation around its axis in sidereal time, ΩUTC = 2𝜋∕86 164 s−1\r
(UTC) is the angular velocity of Earth’s rotation around its axis in UTC\r
time, and 𝑡UNIX represents the event timestamp recorded at CMS in UNIX\r
time since January 1st, 1970 (UNIX epoch). The azimuthal angle 𝜙UNIX\r
encodes the phase between the UNIX epoch and J2000, which is the ori\u0002gin of the sidereal time count, and 𝜙longitude is the effective longitude,\r
defined as the angle between the LHC beam at the CMS interaction point\r
and the Greenwich meridian in rad.\r
Data events are classified in 24 bins, corresponding to the 24 sidereal\r
hours within a sidereal day. In the MC simulation, event timestamps are\r
not included; instead, a time-integrated distribution is built and scaled\r
by 1∕24 to define the expected prediction in each sidereal hour bin.\r
This prediction and its associated systematic uncertainties need to be\r
corrected for effects that would potentially depend on sidereal time.

event selection, (upper) in 2016 and (lower) in 2017 samples. The hatched band\r
includes statistical and systematic uncertainties in the predictions. The vertical\r
bars associated with the data points represent their statistical uncertainty. The\r
lower panels show the ratio of the observed data event yields to those expected\r
from simulation.\r
According to the definition of sidereal time, events recorded every day\r
within a year at the same UTC time would populate the bins uniformly.\r
The instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC, and thus the dis\u0002tribution of the number of pileup interactions per bunch crossing evolves\r
over the year. To allow for differences in the instantaneous luminosity\r
profile between sidereal time bins, the distribution in the number of\r
pileup interactions in simulation is corrected to agree with data, as a\r
function of the sidereal hour within a day. The associated uncertainty\r
arises from our imprecise knowledge of the total inelastic cross section,\r
and is computed by varying this cross section by its uncertainty (4.6%)\r
simultaneously in each sidereal time bin.\r
The recorded integrated luminosity per sidereal time bin varies by\r
up to 25% within a sidereal day, reflecting the time structure of the LHC\r
operations. The simulated events are corrected to match the integrated\r
luminosity in each sidereal time bin. The uncertainty in the integrated\r
luminosity measurement originates from various sources in the normal\u0002ization (related to the van der Meer calibration procedure [53–55]) and\r
the integration of the luminosity measurement performed with several\r
independent subdetectors (referred to as luminometers). The normaliza\u0002tion, as well as detector-specific normalization uncertainties are not ex\u0002pected to depend on sidereal time and are treated as uniform. The uncer\u0002taintiesin the time stability and the linearity with respect to pileup, how\u0002ever, are estimated from cross-detector comparisons, i.e., by comparing\r
the agreement between different luminometers, and their dependence\r
on sidereal time can be evaluated explicitly. In 2016, the three main lu\u0002minometers and methods used for the luminosity measurement [55] are\r
the cluster counting in the pixel tracker, an occupancy-based algorithm\r
using the HCAL measurement, and an LHC radiation monitoring system.\r
In 2017, the three main luminometers and methods [56] are a method\r
based on the sum of transverse energy in HCAL towers, pixel detector\r
cluster counting, and the pixel luminosity telescope [57]. The main lu\u0002minometers used for the luminosity measurement are not the same at all\r
times, since the individual luminosity detectors can be affected by vari\u0002ous operational issues. A small dependence of the stability and linearity\r
estimates on the sidereal time is found:\r
• The cross-detector stability is evaluated separately in each side\u0002real time bin by taking the maximum difference among the inte\u0002grated luminosities estimated with the three main luminometers.\r
The relative uncertainty is found to be 0.1–0.3 (0.2–0.4)% in 2016\r
(2017), consistent with the time-integrated uncertainties evaluated\r
in Refs. [55,56].\r
• The time dependence of the linearity of the luminometer response\r
is evaluated in each sidereal time bin by computing the aver\u0002age single-bunch instantaneous luminosity (SBIL), as measured\r
with the different luminometers, and weighting the largest differ\u0002ence with the corresponding cross-detector linearity slopes from\r
Refs. [56,55]. The slopes are obtained from a fit of the ratios of SBIL\r
estimates for pairs of luminometers, as a function of SBIL. The rel\u0002ative uncertainty is found to be at most 0.3 (0.5)% in 2016 (2017),\r
depending on the sidereal time bin. The 2016 result is in agreement\r
with the time-integrated uncertainty evaluated in Ref. [55], but the\r
2017 result is smaller than the uncertainty from Ref. [56] due to\r
the usage of the less-conservative approach from Ref. [55] for the\r
evaluation of the 2017 luminosity.\r
Cross-detector stability and linearity uncertainties are included in the\r
analysis with explicit dependence on sidereal time. The LHC-related un\u0002certainties (normalization uncertainties related to the van der Meer scan\r
procedure) are evaluated to be 0.6 (0.9)% in 2016 (2017), and other lu\u0002minosity uncertainties related to the detector are evaluated to be 0.9\r
(1.4)% in 2016 (2017).\r
The trigger efficiency, potentially changing slightly over the course\r
of the year with the instantaneous luminosity profile, might also de\u0002pend on sidereal time. Simulated events are therefore corrected for the\r
difference in the trigger efficiency between data and simulation as a\r
function of sidereal time. The trigger efficiencies are measured with the\r
same method as in Ref. [58], using events triggered with requirements\r
on the missing transverse momentum 𝑝miss\r
T , which is the magnitude of\r
the 𝑝⃗miss\r
T vector, defined as the projection onto the plane perpendicular\r
to the beam axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF\r
objects in the event, corrected for pileup effects. Events triggered with\r
𝑝miss\r
T requirements are correlated at less than 1% with those passing\r

on reconstructed 𝑝miss\r
T > 100 GeV. At least one jet identified as b jet is\r
required. For each sidereal time bin, a statistical uncertainty is com\u0002puted, and two systematic uncertainties are evaluated by repeating the\r
measurement in subpartitions of the data: an uncertainty for the depen\u0002dence of the trigger efficiency on the number of jets and on the period\r
of data taking. The ratio of trigger efficiencies in data and simulation is\r
found to be in a range 97–99%, with uncertainties at the level of 1%,\r
depending on the sidereal time bin.\r
For other experimental corrections and uncertainties, the depen\u0002dence on sidereal time is unknown. As a consequence, an individual

The CMS Collaboration\r
nuisance parameter per sidereal time bin is conservatively attributed\r
to most of the other experimental uncertainties, whose size is evalu\u0002ated from an estimate not depending on time, allowing the fit to ac\u0002commodate possible time dependence. These experimental uncertainties\r
include the following sources: ratios of efficiencies between data and\r
simulation for electron and muon reconstruction, identification, and\r
isolation that arise from tag-and-probe measurements with Z → 𝓁+𝓁−\r
events [23,24] (where 𝓁 = e or μ; uncertainties associated with the jet\r
energy corrections (including jet energy resolution) [28]; uncertainties\r
arising from the identification of b jets [33]; and uncertainties associated\r
with the gradual shift in the timing of the inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger.\r
All of these uncertainties are treated as impacting the shape of the num\u0002ber of b jets distribution, as well as its normalization, and are treated\r
as uncorrelated across sidereal time. Where relevant, each uncertainty\r
source is split into systematic uncertainties correlated year-to-year, and\r
a year-to-year uncorrelated component essentially of statistical nature.\r
Two additionalsources of theoretical origin impact experimental quanti\u0002ties and are treated as correlated as functions of sidereal time and years:\r
the uncertainty in the jet energy scale arising from the parton flavors,\r
obtained by comparing herwig and pythia simulation; and the uncer\u0002tainty in lepton isolation arising from the phase space extrapolation of\r
efficiencies, from Z → 𝓁+𝓁− to tt events. The uncertainties inducing the\r
largest impact on the distribution of the number of b jets for the tt pro\u0002cess are the electron identification (1.2% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017)\r
and b jet identification uncertainty (2% at low number of jets to 5% at\r
high number of jets).\r
Contributions from background processes are estimated from simu\u0002lation. After the selection, the event yield for background processes is\r
about 8% of the total number of expected events (Table 1), dominated\r
by single top quark processes. The normalization of single top quark\r
processes, whose contribution is dominated by the tW process, is as\u0002signed an uncertainty of 30%, accounting for the interference with the\r
tt process in the selected phase space. Diboson and V+jets processes\r
are attributed an uncertainty of 30% as well estimated for the predic\u0002tions in the selected phase-space. All these uncertainties are estimated\r
following the prescription from Ref. [59]. An uncertainty of 20% is as\u0002sociated with ttV processes [60]. A normalization uncertainty of 4% is\r
assigned to the SM tt process [59] in the SME fit (Section 7).\r
The uncertainty corresponding to the correction of the top quark\r
𝑝T in the tt process is estimated by the difference with respect to not\r
applying the correction (signatures for violation of Lorentz invariance\r
searched for in this Letter cannot induce a modification of the top quark\r
and antiquark 𝑝T, once integrated over time). Other theoretical uncer\u0002tainties are arising from the top quark mass (obtained by varying 𝑚t by\r
1 GeV up and down around its nominal value); from the parameter ℎdamp\r
controlling the matching between matrix element and parton shower in\r
the powheg generator (varied around its nominal value as 1.379+0.926\r
−0.505\r
times 𝑚t); uncertainties associated with the CP5 underlying event tune\r
(estimated during the tuning process [49]); and color reconnection un\u0002certainties in the parton shower. Uncertainties in the parton shower\r
modeling, related to initial- and final-state radiation, are included for\r
tt and single top quark processes by varying the renormalization scale\r
for initial- and final-state QCD emission in the parton shower by a fac\u0002tor 2 up and down. Uncertainties arising from our missing knowledge of\r
higher-order corrections in pQCD are included separately for tt, single\r
top quark, ttV, and V+jets processes by constructing an envelope of\r
maximum variation computed from renormalization and factorization\r
scale varied by a factor 1/2 to 2, excluding anticorrelated variations.\r
Uncertainties in the PDFs and the strong coupling constant 𝛼S are eval\u0002uated with the Hessian set of NNPDF3.1 (102 replicas) and added in\r
quadrature, with a single nuisance parameter for tt, single top quark,\r
ttV, and V+jets processes. The ℎdamp, CP5 tune, and color reconnec\u0002tion sources modify the normalization of the distribution in the number\r
of b jets, while all the other theoretical uncertainties modify the shape\r
of the distribution. Theoretical uncertainties related to SM predictions\r
are uniform across sidereal time.\r
A theoretical uncertainty corresponding to single top quark time\r
modulation in the SME is included in the SME fit (described in Sec\u0002tion 7), and treated as correlated across sidereal time.\r
The same MC samples are used to predict the event yields in each\r
sidereal time bin, separately for 2016 and 2017. Statistical uncertain\u0002ties in the MC samples are included as log-normal uncertainties inde\u0002pendently for each bin of the b jet multiplicity distribution, treated as\r
correlated across sidereal time bins.\r
The assumed correlations of the uncertainties between years of data\r
taking and sidereal time bins are detailed in Table 2.\r
6. Measurement of the normalized 𝐭𝐭 differential cross section\r
with sidereal time\r
The normalized differential cross section for tt production is mea\u0002sured by employing a profile likelihood template fit of the predictions\r
from simulation to the data including all sidereal time bins, based on\r
the LHC test statistic [61–63]. Since the SM predictions for the tt cross\r
section are identical in each particle-level bin 𝑖, and because unfolding\r
for detector effects is not needed (particle- and reconstructed-level side\u0002real time are identical), the normalized differential cross section 𝜎𝑖∕𝜎avg\r
in bin 𝑖 (where 𝜎avg is the averaged cross section over all sidereal time\r
bins) reduces to 𝜇𝑖∕𝜇avg, where 𝜇𝑖 is the ratio of the observed tt yield\r
to the tt yield predicted in the SM, and 𝜇avg = ∑\r
𝑘 𝜇𝑘∕24. The fractions\r
𝑓𝑖 = 𝜇𝑖∕𝜇avg for 23 sidereal time bins are directly fitted as parameters of\r
interest together with 𝜇avg; the remaining fraction and its uncertainty is\r
computed via error propagation using the covariance matrix of the fit.\r
In performing the measurement of the tt normalized differential\r
cross section as a function of sidereal time, the distributions in the num\u0002ber of b jets in each sidereal time bin are used as discriminant observ\u0002ables between tt and background processes. Uncertainties described in\r
Section 5 are considered either as nuisance parameters with log-normal\r
distribution attributed to the normalization of the distribution in the\r
number of b jets, or as nuisance parameters distorting the shape of the\r
distribution in the number of b jets. Uncertainties follow the correla\u0002tion scheme highlighted in Table 2: when the dependency with sidereal\r
time is known, the uncertainties are treated as correlated across side\u0002real time bin (including uniform theory and background normalization\r
uncertainties); and when the dependency is not known, the uncertain\u0002ties are treated as uncorrelated across sidereal time bin. Prefit and postfit\r
distributions are illustrated in Fig. 2. The prefit distribution corresponds\r
to the expected SM event yields and their uncertainties before the fit is\r
performed. After the model is fitted to the data, the final values of the\r
parameters and their uncertainties are obtained, corresponding to the\r
postfit distribution. The predicted distributions of the number of b jets\r
are not the same in each time bin, because corrections for integrated\r
luminosity, pileup, and trigger efficiencies are applied as a function of\r
sidereal time.\r
The normalized differential cross section is shown in Fig. 3. A\r
goodness-of-fit test including constraints from the nuisance parame\u0002ters [64] results in a 𝑝-value [65] of 0.92 for the adequacy of the MC\r
model to describe data.\r
Fig. 4 shows a breakdown of the uncertainties associated with the\r
measurement of tt normalized differential cross section, according to\r
the treatment of their dependences on sidereal time. The measurement is\r
dominated by systematic uncertainties. The experimental uncertainties\r
that are treated as uncorrelated in sidereal time have the largest im\u0002pact on the normalized differential cross section, and they arise mainly\r
from sources related to electrons, jet energy scale, and b tagging. The\r
uncertainties featuring explicit dependence on sidereal time have an im\u0002pact that is smaller than the statistical uncertainty, and are dominated\r
by trigger uncertainties. Uncertainties that are uniform in sidereal time\r
(flat luminosity component, background normalization, theory uncer\u0002tainties) contribute to a lesser extent.

7. Testing Lorentz invariance with the SME\r
Corrections to the matrix element of tt production and decay arising\r
from Lorentz-violating terms in the SME are known at LO in pQCD [16],\r
and are linear in the SME coefficients, stemming from the interference\r
between SME and SM predictions. Within the CMS reference frame, the\r
variation of the tt cross section with sidereal time 𝑡 is quantified with\r
the function [14] 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝜎SME(𝑡)∕𝜎SM − 1, where 𝜎SME (𝜎SM) are the\r
values predicted in the SME (SM):\r

with 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐𝜇𝜈 + 𝑑𝜇𝜈 and 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐𝜇𝜈 − 𝑑𝜇𝜈 ; where 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent\r
summation over space-time indices in the CMS detector frame; 𝑃 , 𝐹 ,\r
and 𝐹̄ are the squared LO matrix elements of the SM tt production (ei\u0002ther quark-antiquark annihilation or gluon fusion), and top quark and\r
antiquark decays; and 𝛿𝑃 , 𝛿𝐹 , 𝛿𝐹̄ are their corrections predicted in the\r
SME. Rotation matrices 𝑅(𝑡) represent transformations of observer co\u0002ordinates from the SCF to the CMS reference frame, depending on the\r
Earth’s rotation around its axis with angular velocity Ωsidereal. The coor\u0002dinates of the CMS interaction point are specified [66] by the azimuth\r
on the LHC ring (𝜙 = 101.28◦), the latitude (𝜆 = 46.31◦ N), and the lon\u0002gitude (𝓁 = 6.08◦ E). Furthermore, the LHC plane, and thus the CMS\r
cavern, has an angle of 𝛾 = 0.705◦ relative to the surface.\r
A tt production sample, generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo at\r
LO in pQCD with parton shower, underlying event, and hadronization\r
simulated with pythia 8, followed by full detector simulation, is used\r
to evaluate the signal 𝑓(𝑡) functions. The 𝑓(𝑡) functions are computed\r
for each number of reconstructed b jets separately for each year and\r
sidereal time bin. Events containing exactly 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 b jets at the\r
reconstructed level are used to evaluate the matrix elements 𝑃 , 𝐹 , 𝐹̄\r
and their SME corrections, using exact LO kinematics before showering.\r
The SME coefficients are classified into four families extracted sep\u0002arately, corresponding to 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 (assuming\r
𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑑𝜇𝜈 = 0), and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐𝜇𝜈 = 0). Within\r
the chosen basis of coefficients adopted in the SME, these matrices are\r
defined as symmetric and traceless. Coefficients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑇 𝑇\r
induce a shift in the tt cross section and are not considered. Since the\r
𝑍-axis is defined as the Earth’s rotation axis, and because modulation\r
of the tt cross section with sidereal time is induced by rotation around\r
this axis, there is by definition no sensitivity in the coefficients with in\u0002dices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑍. For similar reasons, coefficients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑇\r
are not considered. Coefficients with 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑋𝑇 or 𝑌 𝑇 are found to in\u0002duce very small SME corrections and are also not considered. Remaining\r
coefficients correspond to the combinations 𝑐𝑋𝑋 = −𝑐𝑌 𝑌 , 𝑐𝑋𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑋,\r
𝑐𝑌 𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑌 , and 𝑐𝑋𝑌 = 𝑐𝑌 𝑋 (and similar expressions for the three other\r
scenarios). A total of 16 sets of coefficients is determined. An illustration\r
of their impact on the tt cross section is shown in Fig. 5.

The Lagrangian defined in Eq. (1) impacts all processes involving\r
top quarks, including single top quark and ttV processes. The latter pro\u0002cesses have a small yield and their variation with sidereal time can be\r
neglected, contrary to the former processes. Expressions for the matrix\r
elements of single top quark production in the SME are not available,\r
to our knowledge. Among the single top quark processes, tW produc\u0002tion has the largest contribution in the selected dileptonic event sample.\r
Therefore, uncertainties corresponding to single top quark time mod\u0002ulation in the SME are attributed to single top quark processes, and\r
computed from matrix elements predicted in the SME for top quark and\r
antiquark decay only, in an MC sample of tW processes generated at\r
LO. These uncertainties correspond to a value of the SME coefficients\r
of ±3 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑋𝑌 directions, and ±10 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑍 and\r
𝑌 𝑍 directions, at the same order of magnitude as the expected sensi\u0002tivity in the worst case among 𝑐𝐿, 𝑐𝑅, 𝑐, and 𝑑 sets of coefficients. In\r
the case of 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 coefficients, which do not affect the top quark or anti\u0002quark in the decay (as highlighted in Eq. (3)), the uncertainty model for\r
𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 is used. In measuring individually the SME coefficients, the SME\r
uncertainty for single top quark processes in a given direction has been

The discriminant observable used to extract the SME coefficients is\r
the same as in the differential measurement (Section 6), with event\r
corrections and systematic uncertainties described in Section 5. The like\u0002lihood fit is performed in two scenarios: 1) independently for each set\r
of coefficients as a single parameter of interest, with all other parame\u0002ters being set to zero; 2) independently for each set of coefficients as a\r
single parameter of interest, with the parameters corresponding to the\r
three other directions (among 𝑋𝑋, 𝑋𝑌 , 𝑋𝑍, 𝑌 𝑍 directions) floating\r
in the fit, for the four families of coefficients 𝑐𝐿, 𝑐𝑅, 𝑐, and 𝑑 separately.\r
The measured values of the SME sets of coefficients in the latter sce\u0002nario is shown in Fig. 6, while Table 3 compares the values for the two\r
scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 yield expected uncertainties identical up to\r
the second digit, because the correlation between the four sets of coeffi\u0002cients in a family is found to be 0–4%. A 𝑝-value of 0.98 is obtained for\r
the measurements of the coefficients in a given direction while the co\u0002efficients corresponding to the three other directions are floating in the\r
fit. All of the measured values for the SME coefficients are compatible\r
with zero, in agreement with the SM within one standard deviation or\r
less, indicating no sign of deviation from Lorentz invariance. The preci\u0002sion achieved on the values of the coefficients of the 𝑐𝐿 and 𝑐𝑅 families\r
on the one hand, and on the values of the coefficients of the 𝑑 family\r
on the other hand, is improved respectively by a factor 20–50 and up to\r
100 over the previous constraints [14]. The coefficients of the 𝑐 family\r
are measured for the first time.\r
The impact of the uncertainties in the SME coefficients is shown in\r
Fig. 7 in the case of the fit of individual sets of coefficients, while the\r
coefficients corresponding to the three other directions are left floating.\r
Systematic uncertainties uncorrelated between sidereal time bins are\r
dominating the precision, at a level of approximately three times higher\r
than the statistical uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties that are\r
nonuniform and correlated across sidereal time impact the precision at\r
about half the impact of the statistical uncertainties. The uncertainties\r
that are uniform in sidereal time have a smaller impact.\r
8. Summary\r
A search for violation of Lorentz invariance has been performed us\u0002ing top quark pairs (tt), requiring the presence of one muon and one\r
electron in the events. Data collected in 2016–2017 with the CMS de\u0002tector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 are used.\r
A measurement of the tt normalized differential cross section as a func\u0002tion of sidereal time is performed. The Lorentz invariance assumption is\r
tested by measuring 16 sets of coefficients within the standard model ex\u0002tension, an effective field theory predicting a modulation of the tt cross\r
section with sidereal time. Measurements of the Lorentz-violating cou\u0002plings are found to be compatible with the standard model hypothesis.\r
The precision of the results ranges from less than 1 × 10−3 to 8 × 10−3\r
for the measured coefficients. This constitutes the most precise test of\r
the isotropy in special relativity using top quarks at a hadron collider.\r

A search for violation of Lorentz invariance in the production of top quark pairs (tt) is presented. The measured\r
normalized differential tt production cross section, as a function of the sidereal time, is examined for potential\r
modulations induced by Lorentz-invariance breaking operators in an effective field theory extension of the\r
standard model (SM). The cross section is measured from collision events collected by the CMS detector at a\r
center-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1, and containing one\r
electron and one muon. The results are found to be compatible with zero, in agreement with the SM, and are\r
used to place upper limits at 68% confidence level on the magnitude of the Lorentz-violating couplings ranging\r
from 1–8 × 10−3. This is the first precision test of the isotropy in special relativity with top quarks at the LHC,\r
restricting further the bounds on such couplings by up to two orders of magnitude with respect to previous\r
searches conducted at the Tevatron."""

Lorentz invariance is a key ingredient of the relativistic description\r
of our world, on the scale of elementary particles as well as on large\r
scales in the Universe. The standard model (SM) of particle physics\r
is a relativistic quantum field theory, and as such it must contain a\r
Lorentz-invariant action. General relativity preserves Lorentz invariance\r
locally. The Lorentz group contains rotations and boosts in Minkowski\r
spacetime. Models of quantum gravity, e.g., string theory [1] and loop\r
quantum gravity [2], can, however, predict breaking of Lorentz invari\u0002ance at a high mass scale. A quantum theory including gravity may be\r
governed by an energy scale lower than the Planck mass, possibly at the\r
TeV scale [3]. Thus, induced deviations from Lorentz invariance may be\r
measurable at the LHC.\r
The standard model extension (SME) [4,5] is an effective field the\u0002ory in which all operators violating Lorentz invariance are added to the\r
SM Lagrangian. Its coefficients, controlling the size of Lorentz invari\u0002ance breaking, are different for each particle. While coefficients related\r
to photons, neutrons, protons, and neutrinos have been measured pre\u0002cisely [6], the quark sector remains constrained at a relatively lower\r
precision. The ZEUS Collaboration at the DESY HERA recently searched\r
for violation of Lorentz invariance arising from light quarks in deep\r
inelastic scattering data [7]. Searches for Lorentz invariance violation\r
were performed in neutral meson mixing at KLOE [8], KTeV [9], FO-\r
⋆ E-mail address: cms-publication-committee-chair@cern.ch.\r
CUS [10], BaBar [11], D0 [12], and LHCb [13]. Violation of Lorentz\r
invariance was searched for with top quark pairs (tt) by the D0 ex\u0002periment [14] at the Fermilab Tevatron, showing compatibility with\r
Lorentz invariance with an absolute uncertainty of about 10% on the\r
tested SME coefficients. The proton-proton (pp) collisions at the CERN\r
LHC at √𝑠 = 13 TeV produce tt events with a cross section approxi\u0002mately 100 times higher than that of the Tevatron. Studies showed that\r
the measurements at the LHC have a large potential to significantly im\u0002prove upon existing results [15].\r
In this Letter, the first search for Lorentz invariance violation with\r
top quarks at the LHC is presented, within the context of the SME.\r
Signatures for violation of Lorentz invariance involving top quarks are\r
parameterized with the SME Lagrangian [16]:\r

where 𝜓 and 𝜓̄ are the Dirac fields for top quarks and antiquarks, 𝑚t\r
is the top quark mass, and 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 are the unitless SME coeffi\u0002cients. Unlike the SM fields, 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 are not modified under Lorentz\r
transformations of the particle system: they are constant 4×4 matrices,\r
thereby breaking Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian. They indicate\r
a preferential direction in spacetime as seen by top quarks, violating\r
the isotropy of special relativity. Boosts associated with the Earth’s ro\u0002tation and with the revolution around the sun are negligible relative to\r

top quark boosts. Lorentz invariance is preserved when 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 are\r
zero.\r
Choosing a reference frame is needed to report measurements of\r
Lorentz-violating coefficients, in analogy, for instance, with the mea\u0002surement of particle energies, which are not invariant under Lorentz\r
transformation. By convention, results are reported in the sun-centered\r
frame (SCF) [6], with its origin at the center of the sun; the 𝑍 axis\r
pointing north, parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis; the 𝑋 axis pointing\r
to the intersection of the ecliptic and celestial equator on January 1st,\r
2000 (J2000); and the 𝑌 axis completing the direct basis. The SCF can be\r
considered as inertial in the lifetime of a physics experiment. Hereafter,\r
the coefficients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 with space-time indices 𝜇 or 𝜈 = 𝑇 ,𝑋, 𝑌 ,𝑍\r
are expressed in the SCF (to be distinguished from the space-time indices\r
of the CMS frame). The relevant measure of time in this reference frame\r
is called sidereal time. While one rotation period of the Earth is equal\r
to approximately 23 h 56 min UTC (i.e., Universal Time Coordinated,\r
where UTC seconds are defined from Cesium atomic hyperfine transi\u0002tions), one rotation period is defined as being equal to 24 sidereal hours.\r
The CMS detector moves around the Earth’s rotation axis during a side\u0002real day, and so does the beam line direction at the interaction point,\r
or the average direction of top quarks produced in the collisions. As a\r
consequence, top quark couplings 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 depend on time, result\u0002ing in cross sections for top quark production modulating with sidereal\r
time. Searching for such signatures is the goal of this Letter.\r
We report a search for violation of Lorentz invariance in pp → tt pro\u0002duction with the CMS experiment at √𝑠 = 13 TeV, using events with one\r
muon and one electron of opposite charge in the final state, stemming\r
from the decay tt → bbeνeμνμ (where the particle or antiparticle nature\r
of the leptons is implied). The eμ channel provides a high purity sample\r
of tt events owing to the negligible contribution from Z+jets processes.\r
A data sample recorded in 2016–2017 with the CMS experiment and cor\u0002responding to an integrated luminosity of 77.8 fb−1 is analyzed. Events\r
are categorized based on the number of jets identified as originating\r
from b quarks (b jets) to improve the separation between the tt signal\r
and the background processes. The normalized tt cross section is mea\u0002sured differentially as a function of the sidereal time, in bins of hours\r
within the sidereal day, by performing a profile maximum likelihood fit\r
to the event yields in the b jet multiplicity. The measurement is used\r
to constrain, for the first time at the LHC, the Lorentz-violating coeffi\u0002cients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 impacting top quarks. Tabulated results are provided\r
in the HEPData record for this analysis [17].\r
The Letter is organized as follows. A description of the CMS detec\u0002tor and event reconstruction is provided in Section 2. Section 3 gives\r
details on simulation samples, and Section 4 describes the event selec\u0002tion. Event corrections and associated systematic uncertainties, as well\r
as their treatment relative to sidereal time, are detailed in Section 5. The\r
normalized differential cross section for tt production as a function of\r
sidereal time is measured in Section 6, providing a model-independent\r
result. Bounds on the coefficients 𝑐𝜇𝜈 and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 within the SME frame\u0002work are extracted in Section 7. The Letter concludes with a Summary\r
in Section 8."""

text = """
The CMS apparatus [18–20] is a multipurpose, nearly hermetic de\u0002tector, designed to trigger on [21,22] and identify electrons, muons,\r
photons, and hadrons [23–25]. A global “particle-flow” (PF) algo\u0002rithm [26] aims to reconstruct all individual particles in an event, com\u0002bining information provided by the all-silicon inner tracker and by the\r
crystal electromagnetic (ECAL) and brass-scintillator hadron (HCAL)\r
calorimeters, operating inside a 3.8 T superconducting solenoid, with\r
data from the gas-ionization muon detectors embedded in the flux\u0002return yoke outside the solenoid. The reconstructed particles are used\r
to build τ leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum [27–29]. A\r
more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a defini\u0002tion of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables,\r
can be found in Refs. [18–20].\r
Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger system. The\r
first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses infor\u0002mation from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at\r
a rate of around 100 kHz within a fixed latency of about 4 μs [21].\r
During the 2016–2017 data taking, a gradual shift in the timing of the\r
inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger in the region at |𝜂| > 2.0, where 𝜂 is the\r
pseudorapidity, caused a specific trigger inefficiency. Correction factors,\r
which are small, were computed from data and applied to the simula\u0002tion. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists\r
of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruc\u0002tion software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate\r
to around 1 kHz before data storage [22]. Events are selected at the HLT\r
by requiring the presence of one or two leptons, with transverse momen\u0002tum (𝑝T) thresholds as follows: one electron with 𝑝T > 12 GeV and one\r
muon with 𝑝T > 23 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 23 GeV and one muon\r
with 𝑝T > 8 GeV; one electron with 𝑝T > 27 (35) GeV in 2016 (2017);\r
or one muon with 𝑝T > 24 (27) GeV in 2016 (2017).\r
The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy mea\u0002surement in the ECAL with the momentum measurement in the tracker.\r
Electron candidates are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 and 20 GeV for the\r
highest 𝑝T (leading) and second-highest 𝑝T (subleading) lepton. Fur\u0002thermore, electrons must have |𝜂| < 2.4, and their energy deposit in\r
the ECAL must lie outside of the transition region between the barrel\r
and endcap sections (1.44 < |𝜂| < 1.56). Electron candidates must satisfy\r
tight identification criteria and are required to be isolated in the detector\r
to reject jets misidentified as electrons. Identification criteria comprise\r
selections on a shower shape variable in the ECAL, on the matching of\r
the track with the ECAL energy deposit, on the ratio of HCAL over ECAL\r
energy deposits around the candidate, the hits in the inner tracker, and\r
on criteria to reject electrons arising from photon conversions [23]. An\r
isolation variable is computed with the PF algorithm asthe scalar 𝑝T sum\r
of photons, charged and neutral hadrons in a cone around the electron\r
direction. The cone is defined by Δ𝑅 =\r
√\r
(Δ𝜂)\r
2 + (Δ𝜙)2 < 0.3, where\r
Δ𝜂 and Δ𝜙 are the 𝜂 and azimuthal angle differences between the PF\r
particles and the electron, respectively. Contributions to the isolation\r
sum from other inelastic pp interactions in the same or nearby bunch\r
crossing (pileup) are corrected using the FastJet estimator [30]. The\r
relative isolation, calculated as the isolation sum divided by the electron\r
𝑝T, is used. Differences in reconstruction and identification efficiencies\r
between data and simulation are corrected using Z → e+e− events with\r
a “tag-and-probe” method [31].\r
Muons are measured in the range |𝜂| < 2.4, with detection planes\r
made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and\r
resistive-plate chambers. Muon candidates are reconstructed with the PF\r
algorithm. They are required to satisfy 𝑝T > 25 (20) GeV for the lead\u0002ing (subleading) lepton. Muon candidates are required to satisfy tight\r
identification and isolation criteria, to suppress contributions from jets\r
misidentified as muons. Identification criteria include selections on the\r
number of matched muon detector planes, hits in the pixel and tracker,\r
the 𝜒2 of the trajectory fit including tracking layers and muon detector\r
planes, and the transverse impact parameter of the track [24]. A relative\r
isolation variable is calculated with the PF algorithm similar to electrons\r
but with a cone size Δ𝑅 < 0.4. Differences in identification and isolation\r
efficiencies between data and simulation are corrected using Z → μ+μ−\r
events with the tag-and-probe method.\r
Jets are reconstructed from PF candidates, using the anti-𝑘T algo\u0002rithm with a distance parameter of 0.4 [30,32]. Jet momentum is de\u0002termined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and\r
is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5–10% of the true\r
momentum over the entire 𝑝T spectrum and detector acceptance. To\r
mitigate pileup contributions, tracks identified to be originating from\r
pileup vertices are discarded, and an offset correction is applied to cor\u0002rect for the remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived\r
from simulation studies so that the average measured energy of jets be-

the momentum balance in dijet, photon+jet, Z+jet, and multijet events\r
are used to determine any residual differences between the jet energy\r
scale in data and simulation, and appropriate corrections are made [28].\r
Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets po\u0002tentially dominated by instrumental effects or reconstruction failures.\r
Jets are selected if they satisfy 𝑝T > 30 GeV and |𝜂| < 2.4. Jets are not\r

simulating parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event. Re\u0002vision 3453 is used for all the MC samples generated with powheg,\r
while all of the simulation samples use pythia 8.226 (8.230) in 2016\r

unfolded tt data over powheg predictions as a function of the top quark\r

Since this analysis targets the tt final state with two charged leptons\r
of different flavors and at least one b jet, single top quark production\r

value of 𝑚t = 172.5 GeV is used. Diboson production samples (WW, WZ,\r
ZZ) are generated with pythia 8. The cross section for the WW pro\u0002cess is computed at NNLO [45], while the WZ and ZZ cross sections\r
are computed at NLO with mcfm [46] version 6.6. The W+jets and\r
Z+jets processes (grouped together and denoted as V+jets) are gen\u0002erated using MadGraph5_amc@nlo, at leading order (LO) matched\r

lower panels show the ratio of the observed data event yields to those expected\r
from simulation.\r
According to the definition of sidereal time, events recorded every day\r
within a year at the same UTC time would populate the bins uniformly.\r
The instantaneous luminosity delivered by the LHC, and thus the dis\u0002tribution of the number of pileup interactions per bunch crossing evolves\r
over the year. To allow for differences in the instantaneous luminosity\r
profile between sidereal time bins, the distribution in the number of\r
pileup interactions in simulation is corrected to agree with data, as a\r
function of the sidereal hour within a day. The associated uncertainty\r
arises from our imprecise knowledge of the total inelastic cross section,\r
and is computed by varying this cross section by its uncertainty (4.6%)\r
simultaneously in each sidereal time bin.\r
The recorded integrated luminosity per sidereal time bin varies by\r
up to 25% within a sidereal day, reflecting the time structure of the LHC\r
operations. The simulated events are corrected to match the integrated\r
luminosity in each sidereal time bin. The uncertainty in the integrated\r
luminosity measurement originates from various sources in the normal\u0002ization (related to the van der Meer calibration procedure [53–55]) and\r
the integration of the luminosity measurement performed with several\r
independent subdetectors (referred to as luminometers). The normaliza\u0002tion, as well as detector-specific normalization uncertainties are not ex\u0002pected to depend on sidereal time and are treated as uniform. The uncer\u0002taintiesin the time stability and the linearity with respect to pileup, how\u0002ever, are estimated from cross-detector comparisons, i.e., by comparing\r
the agreement between different luminometers, and their dependence\r
on sidereal time can be evaluated explicitly. In 2016, the three main lu\u0002minometers and methods used for the luminosity measurement [55] are\r
the cluster counting in the pixel tracker, an occupancy-based algorithm\r
using the HCAL measurement, and an LHC radiation monitoring system.\r
In 2017, the three main luminometers and methods [56] are a method\r
based on the sum of transverse energy in HCAL towers, pixel detector\r
cluster counting, and the pixel luminosity telescope [57]. The main lu\u0002minometers used for the luminosity measurement are not the same at all\r
times, since the individual luminosity detectors can be affected by vari\u0002ous operational issues. A small dependence of the stability and linearity\r
estimates on the sidereal time is found:\r
• The cross-detector stability is evaluated separately in each side\u0002real time bin by taking the maximum difference among the inte\u0002grated luminosities estimated with the three main luminometers.\r
The relative uncertainty is found to be 0.1–0.3 (0.2–0.4)% in 2016\r
(2017), consistent with the time-integrated uncertainties evaluated\r
in Refs. [55,56].\r
• The time dependence of the linearity of the luminometer response\r
is evaluated in each sidereal time bin by computing the aver\u0002age single-bunch instantaneous luminosity (SBIL), as measured\r
with the different luminometers, and weighting the largest differ\u0002ence with the corresponding cross-detector linearity slopes from\r
Refs. [56,55]. The slopes are obtained from a fit of the ratios of SBIL\r
estimates for pairs of luminometers, as a function of SBIL. The rel\u0002ative uncertainty is found to be at most 0.3 (0.5)% in 2016 (2017),\r
depending on the sidereal time bin. The 2016 result is in agreement\r
with the time-integrated uncertainty evaluated in Ref. [55], but the\r
2017 result is smaller than the uncertainty from Ref. [56] due to\r
the usage of the less-conservative approach from Ref. [55] for the\r
evaluation of the 2017 luminosity.\r
Cross-detector stability and linearity uncertainties are included in the\r
analysis with explicit dependence on sidereal time. The LHC-related un\u0002certainties (normalization uncertainties related to the van der Meer scan\r
procedure) are evaluated to be 0.6 (0.9)% in 2016 (2017), and other lu\u0002minosity uncertainties related to the detector are evaluated to be 0.9\r
(1.4)% in 2016 (2017).\r
The trigger efficiency, potentially changing slightly over the course\r
of the year with the instantaneous luminosity profile, might also de\u0002pend on sidereal time. Simulated events are therefore corrected for the\r
difference in the trigger efficiency between data and simulation as a\r
function of sidereal time. The trigger efficiencies are measured with the\r
same method as in Ref. [58], using events triggered with requirements\r
on the missing transverse momentum 𝑝miss\r
T , which is the magnitude of\r
the 𝑝⃗miss\r
T vector, defined as the projection onto the plane perpendicular\r
to the beam axis of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF\r
objects in the event, corrected for pileup effects. Events triggered with\r
𝑝miss\r
T requirements are correlated at less than 1% with those passing\r
single-lepton and dilepton triggers. Events must satisfy a requirement\r
on reconstructed 𝑝miss\r
T > 100 GeV. At least one jet identified as b jet is\r
required. For each sidereal time bin, a statistical uncertainty is com\u0002puted, and two systematic uncertainties are evaluated by repeating the\r
measurement in subpartitions of the data: an uncertainty for the depen\u0002dence of the trigger efficiency on the number of jets and on the period\r
of data taking. The ratio of trigger efficiencies in data and simulation is\r
found to be in a range 97–99%, with uncertainties at the level of 1%,\r
depending on the sidereal time bin.\r
For other experimental corrections and uncertainties, the depen\u0002dence on sidereal time is unknown. As a consequence, an individual

nuisance parameter per sidereal time bin is conservatively attributed\r
to most of the other experimental uncertainties, whose size is evalu\u0002ated from an estimate not depending on time, allowing the fit to ac\u0002commodate possible time dependence. These experimental uncertainties\r
include the following sources: ratios of efficiencies between data and\r
simulation for electron and muon reconstruction, identification, and\r
isolation that arise from tag-and-probe measurements with Z → 𝓁+𝓁−\r
events [23,24] (where 𝓁 = e or μ; uncertainties associated with the jet\r

arising from the identification of b jets [33]; and uncertainties associated\r
with the gradual shift in the timing of the inputs of the ECAL L1 trigger.\r
All of these uncertainties are treated as impacting the shape of the num\u0002ber of b jets distribution, as well as its normalization, and are treated\r
as uncorrelated across sidereal time. Where relevant, each uncertainty\r
source is split into systematic uncertainties correlated year-to-year, and\r
a year-to-year uncorrelated component essentially of statistical nature.\r
Two additionalsources of theoretical origin impact experimental quanti\u0002ties and are treated as correlated as functions of sidereal time and years:\r
the uncertainty in the jet energy scale arising from the parton flavors,\r
obtained by comparing herwig and pythia simulation; and the uncer\u0002tainty in lepton isolation arising from the phase space extrapolation of\r
efficiencies, from Z → 𝓁+𝓁− to tt events. The uncertainties inducing the\r
largest impact on the distribution of the number of b jets for the tt pro\u0002cess are the electron identification (1.2% in 2016 and 2.1% in 2017)\r
and b jet identification uncertainty (2% at low number of jets to 5% at\r
high number of jets).\r
Contributions from background processes are estimated from simu\u0002lation. After the selection, the event yield for background processes is\r
about 8% of the total number of expected events (Table 1), dominated\r
by single top quark processes. The normalization of single top quark\r
processes, whose contribution is dominated by the tW process, is as\u0002signed an uncertainty of 30%, accounting for the interference with the\r
tt process in the selected phase space. Diboson and V+jets processes\r
are attributed an uncertainty of 30% as well estimated for the predic\u0002tions in the selected phase-space. All these uncertainties are estimated\r
following the prescription from Ref. [59]. An uncertainty of 20% is as\u0002sociated with ttV processes [60]. A normalization uncertainty of 4% is\r
assigned to the SM tt process [59] in the SME fit (Section 7).\r
The uncertainty corresponding to the correction of the top quark\r

with sidereal time\r
The normalized differential cross section for tt production is mea\u0002sured by employing a profile likelihood template fit of the predictions\r
from simulation to the data including all sidereal time bins, based on\r
the LHC test statistic [61–63]. Since the SM predictions for the tt cross\r
section are identical in each particle-level bin 𝑖, and because unfolding\r
for detector effects is not needed (particle- and reconstructed-level side\u0002real time are identical), the normalized differential cross section 𝜎𝑖∕𝜎avg\r
in bin 𝑖 (where 𝜎avg is the averaged cross section over all sidereal time\r
bins) reduces to 𝜇𝑖∕𝜇avg, where 𝜇𝑖 is the ratio of the observed tt yield\r
to the tt yield predicted in the SM, and 𝜇avg = ∑\r
𝑘 𝜇𝑘∕24. The fractions\r
𝑓𝑖 = 𝜇𝑖∕𝜇avg for 23 sidereal time bins are directly fitted as parameters of\r
interest together with 𝜇avg; the remaining fraction and its uncertainty is\r
computed via error propagation using the covariance matrix of the fit.\r
In performing the measurement of the tt normalized differential\r
cross section as a function of sidereal time, the distributions in the num\u0002ber of b jets in each sidereal time bin are used as discriminant observ\u0002ables between tt and background processes. Uncertainties described in\r
Section 5 are considered either as nuisance parameters with log-normal\r
distribution attributed to the normalization of the distribution in the\r
number of b jets, or as nuisance parameters distorting the shape of the\r
distribution in the number of b jets. Uncertainties follow the correla\u0002tion scheme highlighted in Table 2: when the dependency with sidereal\r
time is known, the uncertainties are treated as correlated across side\u0002real time bin (including uniform theory and background normalization\r
uncertainties); and when the dependency is not known, the uncertain\u0002ties are treated as uncorrelated across sidereal time bin. Prefit and postfit\r
distributions are illustrated in Fig. 2. The prefit distribution corresponds\r
to the expected SM event yields and their uncertainties before the fit is\r
performed. After the model is fitted to the data, the final values of the\r
parameters and their uncertainties are obtained, corresponding to the\r
postfit distribution. The predicted distributions of the number of b jets\r
are not the same in each time bin, because corrections for integrated\r
luminosity, pileup, and trigger efficiencies are applied as a function of\r
sidereal time.\r
The normalized differential cross section is shown in Fig. 3. A\r
goodness-of-fit test including constraints from the nuisance parame\u0002ters [64] results in a 𝑝-value [65] of 0.92 for the adequacy of the MC\r
model to describe data.\r
Fig. 4 shows a breakdown of the uncertainties associated with the\r
measurement of tt normalized differential cross section, according to\r
the treatment of their dependences on sidereal time. The measurement is\r
dominated by systematic uncertainties. The experimental uncertainties\r
that are treated as uncorrelated in sidereal time have the largest im\u0002pact on the normalized differential cross section, and they arise mainly\r
from sources related to electrons, jet energy scale, and b tagging. The\r
uncertainties featuring explicit dependence on sidereal time have an im\u0002pact that is smaller than the statistical uncertainty, and are dominated\r
by trigger uncertainties. Uncertainties that are uniform in sidereal time\r
(flat luminosity component, background normalization, theory uncer\u0002tainties) contribute to a lesser extent.

Corrections to the matrix element of tt production and decay arising\r
from Lorentz-violating terms in the SME are known at LO in pQCD [16],\r
and are linear in the SME coefficients, stemming from the interference\r
between SME and SM predictions. Within the CMS reference frame, the\r
variation of the tt cross section with sidereal time 𝑡 is quantified with\r
the function [14] 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝜎SME(𝑡)∕𝜎SM − 1, where 𝜎SME (𝜎SM) are the\r
values predicted in the SME (SM):\r

with 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐𝜇𝜈 + 𝑑𝜇𝜈 and 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 𝑐𝜇𝜈 − 𝑑𝜇𝜈 ; where 𝛼 and 𝛽 represent\r
summation over space-time indices in the CMS detector frame; 𝑃 , 𝐹 ,\r
and 𝐹̄ are the squared LO matrix elements of the SM tt production (ei\u0002ther quark-antiquark annihilation or gluon fusion), and top quark and\r
antiquark decays; and 𝛿𝑃 , 𝛿𝐹 , 𝛿𝐹̄ are their corrections predicted in the\r
SME. Rotation matrices 𝑅(𝑡) represent transformations of observer co\u0002ordinates from the SCF to the CMS reference frame, depending on the\r
Earth’s rotation around its axis with angular velocity Ωsidereal. The coor\u0002dinates of the CMS interaction point are specified [66] by the azimuth\r
on the LHC ring (𝜙 = 101.28◦), the latitude (𝜆 = 46.31◦ N), and the lon\u0002gitude (𝓁 = 6.08◦ E). Furthermore, the LHC plane, and thus the CMS\r
cavern, has an angle of 𝛾 = 0.705◦ relative to the surface.\r
A tt production sample, generated with MadGraph5_amc@nlo at\r
LO in pQCD with parton shower, underlying event, and hadronization\r
simulated with pythia 8, followed by full detector simulation, is used\r
to evaluate the signal 𝑓(𝑡) functions. The 𝑓(𝑡) functions are computed\r
for each number of reconstructed b jets separately for each year and\r
sidereal time bin. Events containing exactly 1, 2, 3, or ≥4 b jets at the\r
reconstructed level are used to evaluate the matrix elements 𝑃 , 𝐹 , 𝐹̄\r
and their SME corrections, using exact LO kinematics before showering.\r
The SME coefficients are classified into four families extracted sep\u0002arately, corresponding to 𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 (assuming\r
𝑐𝐿,𝜇𝜈 = 0), 𝑐𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑑𝜇𝜈 = 0), and 𝑑𝜇𝜈 (assuming 𝑐𝜇𝜈 = 0). Within\r
the chosen basis of coefficients adopted in the SME, these matrices are\r
defined as symmetric and traceless. Coefficients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑇 𝑇\r
induce a shift in the tt cross section and are not considered. Since the\r
𝑍-axis is defined as the Earth’s rotation axis, and because modulation\r
of the tt cross section with sidereal time is induced by rotation around\r
this axis, there is by definition no sensitivity in the coefficients with in\u0002dices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑍. For similar reasons, coefficients with indices 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑍𝑇\r
are not considered. Coefficients with 𝜇𝜈 = 𝑋𝑇 or 𝑌 𝑇 are found to in\u0002duce very small SME corrections and are also not considered. Remaining\r
coefficients correspond to the combinations 𝑐𝑋𝑋 = −𝑐𝑌 𝑌 , 𝑐𝑋𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑋,\r
𝑐𝑌 𝑍 = 𝑐𝑍𝑌 , and 𝑐𝑋𝑌 = 𝑐𝑌 𝑋 (and similar expressions for the three other\r
scenarios). A total of 16 sets of coefficients is determined. An illustration\r
of their impact on the tt cross section is shown in Fig. 5.

The Lagrangian defined in Eq. (1) impacts all processes involving\r
top quarks, including single top quark and ttV processes. The latter pro\u0002cesses have a small yield and their variation with sidereal time can be\r
neglected, contrary to the former processes. Expressions for the matrix\r
elements of single top quark production in the SME are not available,\r
to our knowledge. Among the single top quark processes, tW produc\u0002tion has the largest contribution in the selected dileptonic event sample.\r
Therefore, uncertainties corresponding to single top quark time mod\u0002ulation in the SME are attributed to single top quark processes, and\r
computed from matrix elements predicted in the SME for top quark and\r
antiquark decay only, in an MC sample of tW processes generated at\r
LO. These uncertainties correspond to a value of the SME coefficients\r
of ±3 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑋𝑌 directions, and ±10 × 10−3 in 𝑋𝑍 and\r

the case of 𝑐𝑅,𝜇𝜈 coefficients, which do not affect the top quark or anti\u0002quark in the decay (as highlighted in Eq. (3)), the uncertainty model for\r

The discriminant observable used to extract the SME coefficients is\r
the same as in the differential measurement (Section 6), with event\r
corrections and systematic uncertainties described in Section 5. The like\u0002lihood fit is performed in two scenarios: 1) independently for each set\r
of coefficients as a single parameter of interest, with all other parame\u0002ters being set to zero; 2) independently for each set of coefficients as a\r
single parameter of interest, with the parameters corresponding to the\r
three other directions (among 𝑋𝑋, 𝑋𝑌 , 𝑋𝑍, 𝑌 𝑍 directions) floating\r
in the fit, for the four families of coefficients 𝑐𝐿, 𝑐𝑅, 𝑐, and 𝑑 separately.\r
The measured values of the SME sets of coefficients in the latter sce\u0002nario is shown in Fig. 6, while Table 3 compares the values for the two\r
scenarios. Scenarios 1 and 2 yield expected uncertainties identical up to\r
the second digit, because the correlation between the four sets of coeffi\u0002cients in a family is found to be 0–4%. A 𝑝-value of 0.98 is obtained for\r
the measurements of the coefficients in a given direction while the co\u0002efficients corresponding to the three other directions are floating in the\r
fit. All of the measured values for the SME coefficients are compatible\r
with zero, in agreement with the SM within one standard deviation or\r
less, indicating no sign of deviation from Lorentz invariance. The preci\u0002sion achieved on the values of the coefficients of the 𝑐𝐿 and 𝑐𝑅 families\r
on the one hand, and on the values of the coefficients of the 𝑑 family\r
on the other hand, is improved respectively by a factor 20–50 and up to\r
100 over the previous constraints [14]. The coefficients of the 𝑐 family\r
are measured for the first time.\r
The impact of the uncertainties in the SME coefficients is shown in\r
Fig. 7 in the case of the fit of individual sets of coefficients, while the\r
coefficients corresponding to the three other directions are left floating.\r
Systematic uncertainties uncorrelated between sidereal time bins are\r
dominating the precision, at a level of approximately three times higher\r
