p-ADIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL WAVELETS AND THEIR\r
APPLICATION TO p-ADIC PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL\r
OPERATORS\r
A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH\r
Abstract. In this paper we study some problems related with the theory\r
of multidimensional p-adic wavelets in connection with the theory of mul\u0002tidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators (in the p-adic Lizorkin\r
space). We introduce a new class of n-dimensional p-adic compactly sup\u0002ported wavelets. In one-dimensional case this class includes the Kozyrev\r
p-adic wavelets. These wavelets (and their Fourier transforms) form an or\u0002thonormal complete basis in L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
). A criterion for a multidimensional\r
p-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is\r
derived. We prove that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the Taible\u0002son fractional operator. Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential\r
operators (fractional operator), these results can be intensively used in ap\u0002plications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets are used to construct solutions of\r
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations.\r
1. Introduction\r
There are a lot of papers where different applications of p-adic analysis to\r
physical problems, stochastics, cognitive sciences and psychology are stud\u0002ied [6]– [10], [13]– [19], [30]– [32] (see also the references therein).\r
The field Qp of p-adic numbers is defined as the completion of the field of\r
rational numbers Q with respect to the non-Archimedean p-adic norm | · |p.\r
This norm is defined as follows: |0|p = 0; if an arbitrary rational number x 6= 0\r
is represented as x = p\r
γ m\r
n\r
, where γ = γ(x) ∈ Z, and m and n are not divisible\r
by p, then |x|p = p\r
−γ\r
. This norm in Qp satisfies the strong triangle inequality\r
|x + y|p ≤ max(|x|p, |y|p).\r
It is known that for the p-adic analysis related to the mapping Qp → C,\r
where C is the field of complex numbers, the operation of partial differentiation\r
is not defined, and as a result, large number of models connected with p-adic\r

differential equations use pseudo-differential operators and the theory of p\u0002adic distributions (generalized functions) (see the above mentioned papers and\r
books). In particular, fractional operators Dα = f−α∗ are extensively used,\r
where fα is the p-adic Riesz kernel, ∗ is a convolution. However, in general,\r
Dαϕ 6∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
) for ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
), where D(Qn\r
p\r
) is the space of test functions.\r
Consequently, the operation Dαf is well defined only for some distributions\r
f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
). For example, D−1is defined only on the test functions such that\r
R\r
Qp\r
ϕ(x) dx = 0 [30, IX.2].\r
We recall that similar problems arise for the “C-case” fractional operators\r
(where all functions and distributions are complex or real valued defined on\r
spaces with real or complex coordinates): in general, the Schwartzian test\r
function space S(R\r
n\r
) is not invariant under fractional operators [26], [27]. To\r
solve this problem, in the excellent papers of P. I. Lizorkin [24], [25] a new type\r
spaces invariant under fractional operators were introduced (see also [26], [27]).\r
Taking into account the problems mentioned above, in [3], the p-adic Li\u0002zorkin spaces of test functions and distributions were introduced, and in [3], [4]\r
a class of pseudo-differential operators (including the Taibleson fractional op\u0002erator) defined on them was constructed. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant\r
under our pseudo-differential operators, and consequently, these spaces are\r
their “natural” definition domains and can play a key role in considerations\r
related to the fractional operators problems.\r
Recall that for the one-dimensional case the orthonormal complete basis\r
of eigenfunctions (5.5) of the Vladimirov operator Dα was constructed by\r
S. V. Kozyrev [20]. The eigenfunctions (5.5) are p-adic compactly supported\r
wavelets. Further development and generalization of the theory of such type\r
wavelets can be found in the papers by S. V. Kozyrev [21], [22], A. Yu. Khren\u0002nikov, and S. V. Kozyrev [16], [17], J. J. Benedetto, and R. L. Benedetto [8],\r
and R. L. Benedetto [9].\r
It is typical that such type p-adic compactly supported wavelets are eigen\u0002functions of p-adic pseudo-differential operators. Moreover, these wavelets\r
satisfy the condition R\r
Qp\r
ϕ(x) dx = 0 (see [20]), and, in view of Lemma 3.1,\r
belong to the Lizorkin space Φ(Qp). In [3], there waqs derived the necessary\r
and sufficient condition for multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential opera\u0002tors to have such type multidimensional wavelets as eigenfunctions. Thus the\r
wavelets theory play a key role in p-adic analysis.\r
Contents of the paper. In this paper problems related with the theory of\r
multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators and the theory of multi\u0002dimensional p-adic wavelets are studied. Here the results of our paper [3] are\r
intensively used.\r
In Sec. 2, we recall some facts from the p-adic theory of distributions [12],\r
[28], [29], [30]. In Sec. 3, some facts from the theory of the p-adic Lizorkin

p-ADIC WAVELETS AND p-ADIC PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS 3\r
spaces [3] are recalled. In Sec. 4, we recall some facts on the multidimen\u0002sional pseudo-differential operators defined in the Lizorkin space of distribu\u0002tions D′\r
(Qn\r
p\r
). The fractional Taibleson operator [28, §2], [29, III.4.] is among\r
them. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant under our pseudo-differential opera\u0002tors. It is appropriate to mention here that the class of our operators includes\r
the pseudo-differential operators studied in [19], [33], [34].\r
In Sec. 5, a new type of p-adic compactly supported wavelets (in one- di\u0002mensional (5.3) and multidimensional (5.17) cases) are introduced. These\r
wavelets belong to the Lizorkin space of test functions. The Kozyrev one\u0002dimensional wavelets [20] (see (5.5)) is a particular case of our one-dimensional\r
wavelets (5.3). The scaling function of wavelets (5.3) is a characteristic func\u0002tion of the unit disc. The two-scale equation (5.7) for these wavelets is pre\u0002sented. However, in this paper the multiresolution analysis is not considered.\r
The one-dimensional wavelets (5.3) and multidimensional wavelets (5.17) form\r
orthonormal complete bases in L\r
2\r
(Qp) and L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
), respectively (see Theo\u0002rems 5.1, 5.2). Their Fourier transforms also form orthonormal complete bases\r
in L\r
2\r
(Qp) and L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
), respectively (see Corollary 5.1, 5.2).\r
In Sec. 6, the spectral theory of our pseudo-differential operators is con\u0002structed. By Theorem 6.1 the criterion (6.1) for multidimensional p-adic\r
pseudo-differential operators (3.2) to have multidimensional wavelets (5.17) as\r
eigenfunctions is derived. In particular, the multidimensional wavelets (5.17)\r
are eigenfunctions of the Taibleson fractional operator (see (6.6)).\r
Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential operators, in particular,\r
fractional operator, these results on p-adic wavelets can be intensively used in\r
applications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets can be used to construct solutions of\r
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations [5], [18], [23].\r
2. p-Adic distributions\r
Now we recall some facts from the theory of p-adic distributions (generalized\r
functions). We shall systematically use the notations and results from [30]. Let\r
N, Z, C be the sets of positive integers, integers, complex numbers, respectively.\r
Denote by Q∗\r
p = Qp \\ {0} the multiplicative group of the field Qp. The space\r
Qn\r
p = Qp × · · · × Qp consists of points x = (x1, . . . , xn), where xj ∈ Qp,\r
j = 1, 2 . . . , n, n ≥ 2. The p-adic norm on Qn\r
p\r
is\r
(2.1) |x|p = max\r
1≤j≤n\r
|xj|p, x ∈ Q\r
n\r
p\r
.\r
Denote by Bn\r
γ\r
(a) = {x : |x − a|p ≤ p\r
γ} the ball of radius pγ with the center\r
at a point a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ Qn\r
p\r
and by S\r

γ} =\r

γ\r
(0) = Bn\r
γ\r
and S\r
n\r
γ\r
(0) = S\r
n\r
γ\r
. For the case n = 1 we will omit the upper index n. Here\r
(2.2) B\r
n\r
γ\r
(a) = Bγ(a1) × · · · × Bγ(an),

4 A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH\r
where Bγ(aj ) = {xj: |xj − aj|p ≤ p\r
γ} is a disc of radius pγ with the center at\r
a point aj ∈ Qp, j = 1, 2 . . . , n. Any two balls in Qn\r
p\r
either are disjoint or one\r
contains the other. Every point of the ball is its center.\r
According to [30, I.3,Examples 1,2.], the disc Bγ is represented by the sum\r
of p\r
γ−γ\r
′\r
disjoint discs Bγ\r
′(a), γ\r
′ < γ:\r
(2.3) Bγ = Bγ\r
′ ∪ ∪aBγ′(a),\r
where a = 0 and a = a−rp\r
−r + a−r+1p−r+1 + · · · + a−γ\r
′−1p\r
−γ\r
′−1\r
are the centers\r
of the discs Bγ\r
′(a), r = γ, γ − 1, γ − 2, . . . , γ′ + 1, 0 ≤ aj ≤ p − 1, a−r 6= 0.\r
In particular, the disc B0 is represented by the sum of p disjoint discs\r
(2.4) B0 = B−1 ∪ ∪p−1\r
r=1B−1(r),\r
where B−1(r) = {x ∈ S0 : x0 = r} = r + pZp, r = 1, . . . , p − 1; B−1 = {|x|p ≤\r
p\r
−1} = pZp; and S0 = {|x|p = 1} = ∪\r
p−1\r
r=1B−1(r). Here all the discs are disjoint.\r
We call covering (2.3), (2.4) the canonical covering of the disc B0.\r
A complex-valued function f defined on Qn\r
p\r
is called locally-constant if for\r
any x ∈ Qn\r
p\r
there exists an integer l(x) ∈ Z such that\r
f(x + y) = f(x), y ∈ B\r
n\r
l(x)\r
.\r
Let E(Qn\r
p\r
) and D(Qn\r
p\r
) be the linear spaces of locally-constant C-valued\r
functions on Qn\r
p\r
and locally-constant C-valued functions with compact sup\u0002ports (so-called test functions), respectively; D(Qp), E(Qp) [30, VI.1.,2.]. If\r
ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
), according to Lemma 1 from [30, VI.1.], there exists l ∈ Z, such\r
that\r
ϕ(x + y) = ϕ(x), y ∈ B\r
n\r
l\r
, x ∈ Q\r
n\r
p\r
.\r
The largest of such numbers l = l(ϕ) is called the parameter of constancy of\r
the function ϕ. Let us denote by Dl\r
N (Qn\r
p\r
) the finite-dimensional space of test\r
functions from D(Qn\r
p\r
) having supports in the ball Bn\r
N and with parameters of\r
constancy ≥ l [30, VI.2.]. Denote by D′(Qn\r
p\r
) the set of all linear functionals\r
on D(Qn\r
p\r
) [30, VI.3.].\r
Let us introduce in D(Qn\r
p\r
) a canonical δ-sequence δk(x) = p\r
nkΩ(pk\r
|x|p), and\r
a canonical 1-sequence ∆k(x) = Ω(p\r
−k\r
|x|p), k ∈ Z, x ∈ Qn\r
p\r
, where\r
(2.5) Ω(t) = \u001A\r
1, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1,\r
0, t > 1.\r
Here ∆k(x) is the characteristic function of the ball Bn\r
k\r
. It is clear [30, VI.3.,\r
VII.1.] that δk → δ, k → ∞ in D′(Qn\r
p\r
) and ∆k → 1, k → ∞ in E(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
The Fourier transform of ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
) is defined by the formula\r
F[ϕ](ξ) = Z\r
Qn\r
p\r
χp(ξ · x)ϕ(x) d\r
nx, ξ ∈ Qn\r
p\r
,\r
where χp(ξ · x) = e\r
2πiPn\r
j=1{ξjxj}p\r
; ξ · x is the scalar product of vectors; the\r
function χp(ξjxj ) = e\r
2πi{ξjxj}p\r
for every fixed ξj ∈ Qp is an additive character

p-ADIC WAVELETS AND p-ADIC PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS 5\r
of the field Qp, j = 1, . . . , n; {x}p is the fractional part of a number x ∈ Qp\r
which is defined as follows\r
(2.6) {x}p =\r

p\r
γ\r
(x0 + x1p + x2p\r
2 + · · · + x|γ|−1p|γ|−1\r
), if γ(x) < 0.\r
The Fourier transform is a linear isomorphism D(Qn\r
p\r
) into D(Qn\r
p\r
). Moreover,\r
according to [28, Lemma A.], [29, III,(3.2)], [30, VII.2.],\r
(2.7) ϕ(x) ∈ Dl\r
N (Q\r
n\r
p\r
) iff F\r

ϕ(x)\r
\u0003\r
(ξ) ∈ D−N\r
−l\r
(Q\r
n\r
p\r
).\r
We define the Fourier transform F[f] of a distribution f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) by the\r
relation [30, VII.3.]:\r
(2.8) hF[f], ϕi = hf, F[ϕ]i, ∀ ϕ ∈ D(Q\r
n\r
p\r
).\r
Let A be a matrix and b ∈ Qn\r
p\r
. Then for a distribution f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) the\r
following relation holds [30, VII,(3.3)]:\r
(2.9) F[f(Ax + b)](ξ) = | det A|\r

,\r
where det A 6= 0. According to [30, IV,(3.1)],\r
(2.10) F[∆k](x) = δk(x), k ∈ Z, x ∈ Q\r
n\r
p\r
.\r
In particular, F[Ω(|ξ|p)](x) = Ω(|x|p).\r
The convolution f ∗ g for distributions f, g ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) is defined (see [30,\r
VII.1.]) as\r
(2.11) hf ∗ g, ϕi = lim\r
k→∞\r
hf(x) × g(y), ∆k(x)ϕ(x + y)i\r
if the limit exists for all ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
), where f(x) × g(y) is the direct product\r
of distributions. If for distributions f, g ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) the convolution f ∗ g exists\r
then [30, VII,(5.4)]\r
(2.12) F[f ∗ g] = F[f]F[g].\r
It is well known (see, e.g., [30, III.2.]) that any multiplicative character π of\r
the field Qp can be represented as\r
π(x)\r
def\r
= πα(x) = |x|\r
α−1\r
p π1(x), x ∈ Qp,\r
where π(p) = p\r
1−α and π1(x) is a normed multiplicative character such that\r
π1(x) = π1(|x|px), π1(p) = π1(1) = 1, |π1(x)| = 1. We denote π0 = |x|\r
−1\r
p\r
.\r
Definition 2.1. Let πα be a multiplicative character of the field Qp.\r
(a) According to [1], [2], a distribution fm ∈ D′(Qp) is said to be associated\r

If m = 0 we set that the above sum is empty.\r
(b) We say that a distribution f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) is associated homogeneous (in the\r
wide sense) of degree πα and order m, m ∈ N ∪ {0}, if for all t ∈ Q∗\r
p we have\r

distribution of degree πα and order m − j, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. An associated\r
homogeneous (in the wide sense) distribution of degree πα(t) = |t|\r
α−1\r
p\r
and\r
order m is called associated homogeneous of degree α − 1 and order m.\r
(c) An associated homogeneous distribution (in the wide sense) of order\r
m = 1 is called associated homogeneous distribution (see [11] and [1], [2]).\r
(d) An associated homogeneous distribution of degree πα and order m = 0\r
is called homogeneous distribution of degree πα, i.e.,\r

Here Ψ(Qn\r

In view of (2.7), the following lemma holds.\r

In fact, for n = 1, this lemma was proved in [30, IX.2.]. Unlike the classical\r
Lizorkin space, any function ψ(ξ) ∈ Φ(Qn\r
p\r
) is equal to zero not only at ξ = 0\r
but in a ball Bn ∋ 0, as well.

Let Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
) denote the topological dual of the space Φ(Qn\r
p\r
). We call it the\r
p-adic Lizorkin space of distributions.\r
By Ψ⊥ and Φ⊥ we denote the subspaces of functionals in D′(Qn\r
p\r
) orthogonal\r
to Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
) and Φ(Qn\r
p\r
), respectively. Thus Ψ⊥ = {f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) : f = Cδ, C ∈ C}\r
and Φ⊥ = {f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
) : f = C, C ∈ C}.\r
Proposition 3.1. ( [3])\r

The space Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
) can be obtained from D′(Qn\r
p\r
) by “sifting out” constants.\r
Thus two distributions in D′(Qn\r
p\r
) differing by a constant are indistinguishable\r
as elements of Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
Similarly to (2.8), we define the Fourier transforms of distributions f ∈\r
Φ\r

×(Qnp\r
) and g ∈ Ψ′\r
×(Qnp\r
) by the relations:\r
(3.2)\r
hF[f], ψi = hf, F[ψ]i, ∀ ψ ∈ Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
),\r
hF[g], φi = hg, F[φ]i, ∀ φ ∈ Φ(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
By definition, F[Φ(Qn\r
p\r
)] = Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
) and F[Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
)] = Φ(Qn\r
p\r
), i.e., (3.2) give well\r
defined objects.\r
4. Pseudo-differential operators in the Lizorkin space\r
4.1. Pseudo-differential operators. Consider a class of pseudo-differential\r
operators in the Lizorkin space of the test functions Φ(Qn\r

with symbols A(ξ) ∈ E(Qn\r

Lemma 4.1. The Lizorkin space Φ(Qn\r
p\r
) is invariant under the pseudo- differ\u0002ential operators (4.1). Moreover, A(Φ(Qn\r
p\r
)) = Φ(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
Proof. In view of (2.7) and results of Sec. 3, functions F[φ](ξ) and A(ξ)F[φ](ξ)\r
belong to Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
), and, consequently, (Aφ)(x) ∈ Φ(Qn\r
p\r
), i.e., A(Φ(Qn\r
p\r
)) ⊂\r
Φ(Qn\r
p\r
). Thus the pseudo-differential operators (4.1) are well defined, and the\r
Lizorkin space Φ(Qn\r
p\r
) is invariant under them. Moreover, any function from\r
Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
) can be represented as ψ(ξ) = A(ξ)ψ1(ξ), ψ1 ∈ Ψ(Qn\r
p\r
). This implies\r
that A(Φ(Qn\r
p\r

p\r
). \u0003\r
If we define a conjugate pseudo-differential operator AT as\r

then one can define the operator A in the Lizorkin space of distributions: for\r
f ∈ Φ\r
′\r
(Qn\r
p\r
) we have\r
(4.3) hAf, φi = hf, AT φi, ∀ φ ∈ Φ(Q\r
n\r
p\r
).\r
It is clear that\r
(4.4) Af = F\r
−1\r
[A F[f]] ∈ Φ\r
′\r
(Q\r
n\r
p\r
),\r
i.e., the Lizorkin space of distributions Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
) is invariant under pseudo\u0002differential operators A. Moreover, in view of Lemma 4.1, A(Φ′\r
(Qn\r
p\r
)) =\r
Φ\r
′\r
(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
If A, B are pseudo-differential operators with symbols A(ξ), B(ξ) ∈ E(Qn\r
p\r
\\\r
{0}), respectively, then the operator AB is well defined and represented by\r
the formula\r
(AB)f = F\r
−1\r
[AB F[f]] ∈ Φ\r
′\r
(Q\r
n\r
p\r
).\r
If A(ξ) 6= 0, ξ ∈ Qn\r
p\r
\\{0} then we define the inverse pseudo-differential operator\r
by the formula\r
A\r
−1\r
f = F\r
−1\r
[A\r
−1 F[f]], f ∈ Φ′\r
(Q\r
n\r
p\r
).\r
Thus the family of pseudo-differential operators A with symbols A(ξ) 6= 0,\r
ξ ∈ Qn\r
p \\ {0} forms an Abelian group.\r
If the symbol A(ξ) of the operator A is a homogeneous or an associated\r
homogeneous function (see Definition 2.1) then the pseudo-differential operator\r
A is called homogeneous or associated homogeneous.\r
4.2. The Taibleson fractional operator. Let us consider a pseudo- differ\u0002ential operator Dα\r

This multi-dimensional Taibleson fractional operator was introduced in [28,\r
§2], [29, III.4.] on the space of distributions D′(Qn\r
p\r
) for α ∈ C, α 6= −n.\r
In view of formulas (2.12), (2.16), (2.17), the relation (4.5) can be rewritten\r
as a convolution\r

is called the multidimensional Riesz kernel [28, §2], [29, III.4.], where the\r
function |x|p, x ∈ Qn\r
p\r
is given by (2.1). The Riesz kernel has a removable\r
singularity at α = 0 and according to [28, §2], [29, III.4.], [30, VIII.2], we\r
obtain that hκ0(x), ϕ(x)i\r
def = limα→0hκα(x), ϕ(x)i = ϕ(0), for all ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
),\r
i.e.,\r
(4.7) κ0(x)\r
def = limα→0\r
κα(x) = δ(x).

10 A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH\r
Using (2.13), (2.17), (4.6), and taking into account (3.1) (for details, see [3],\r
[4]), we define κn(·) as a distribution from the Lizorkin space of distributions\r
Φ\r
′\r
(Qn\r

):\r
(4.8) κn(x)\r
def = limα→n\r
κα(x) = −\r
1 − p\r
−n\r
log p\r
log |x|p.\r
With the help of (2.16), (4.7), (4.8), it is easy to see that\r
(4.9) κα(x) ∗ κβ(x) = κα+β(x), α, β ∈ C,\r
holds in the sense of the Lizorkin space Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
In view of (4.7), (4.8), the multi-dimensional Taibleson operator on the\r
Lizorkin space of test functions is defined for all α ∈ C as\r
(4.10) D\r
α\r
x φ\r

n\r
p\r
,\r
where φ ∈ Φ(Qn\r
p\r
).\r
If α 6= n then the Riesz kernel κα(x) is a homogeneous distribution of de\u0002gree α − n, and if α = n then the Riesz kernel is an associated homogeneous\r
distribution of degree 0 and order 1 (see Definitions 2.1,(b),(d)). Thus the\r
Taibleson fractional operator Dα\r
x\r
, α 6= −n is a homogeneous pseudo-differential\r
operator of degree α, and D−n\r
x\r
is an associated homogeneous pseudo-differential\r
operator of degree −n and order 1 with the symbol A(ξ) = P(|ξ|\r
−n\r
p\r
) (see\r
(2.15)).\r
According to Lemma 4.1, the Lizorkin space Φ(Qn\r
p\r
) is invariant under the\r
Taibleson fractional operator Dα\r
x\r
and Dα\r
x\r
(Φ(Qn\r
p\r
)) = Φ(Qn\r
p\r
) [3].\r
In view of (4.2), (4.3), (Dα\r

)\r
T = Dα\r
x and for f ∈ Φ\r

(Qn\r
p\r

α\r
x f, φi\r
def\r

x φi, ∀ φ ∈ Φ(Q\r

).\r
It is clear that Dα\r
x\r
(Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
)) = Φ′(Qn\r
p\r
). Moreover, in view of (4.9), the family\r
of operators Dα\r
x\r
, α ∈ C on the Lizorkin space forms an Abelian group: if\r
f ∈ Φ\r

(Qn\r

This set can be identified with the factor group Qp/Zp. Let\r

where m ≥ 1 is a fixed positive integer.

Let us introduce the function θ\r

s (x) = χp(sx)Ω\r

where γ ∈ Z, s ∈ Jp;m, a ∈ Ip, Ω(t) is the characteristic function (2.5) of the\r

Making the change of variables ξ = p\r

we obtain\r

Thus, in view of Theorem 5.1 (see below), one can see that the functions (5.3)\r
are p-adic wavelets. Moreover, according to (5.4) and Lemma 3.1, the functions\r
θ\r
(m)\r
γsa (x) belong to the Lizorkin space Φ(Qp).\r
It is clear that for any γ ∈ Z and s ∈ Jp;m the functions (5.4) are periodical\r
with the periods Tγs ∈ p\r
m−γZp.\r
In the case m = 1, i.e., for s = p\r

coincide with the Kozyrev wavelets [20]:\r

\u0001\r
for j = 1. Since |x|p ≤ 1,\r
x ∈ Qp, i.e., x = x0 + x1p + x2p\r
2 + · · · , we have p−1x = p−1x0 + x1 + x2p + · · · ,\r
i.e., the fractional part (2.6) of a number p\r
−1x is equal to {p−1x}p = p−1x0.\r
According to (2.4),\r
(5.6) θ1(x) = χp(p\r

Thus the function θ1(x) = χp(p\r

takes values in the set {0, e\r

Thus the system of functions (5.3) is orthonormal.\r

corresponding proof [20] almost word for word. Recall that the system of the\r

taking into account that the system of functions {θ\r

is a complete system, it is sufficient to verify the Parseval identity for the\r

Parseval formula [30, VII,(4.1)].\r
6. p-Adic wavelets as eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential\r
operators\r
6.1. Pseudo-differential operators. As mentioned above, the one- dimen\u0002sional Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) introduced in [20] is a particular case of the\r
wavelets (5.3) for m = 1. Moreover, in [20] S. V. Kozyrev proved that his\r
wavelets (5.5) are eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional Vladimirov operator\r
Dαfor α > 0:\r

θγja(x) = p\r
α(1−γ)\r
θγja(x), x ∈ Qp,\r
where γ ∈ Z, a ∈ Ip, j = 1, 2, . . . p − 1. Later, it was proved in [3, 4.4.] that in\r
fact, the Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) are eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator\r
for any α, i.e., the above formula holds for all α ∈ C.\r
Now we prove that n-dimensional wavelets (5.17) are eigenfunctions for a\r
class of pseudo-differential operators (4.1), which includes the Taibleson frac\u0002tional operator (4.10), (4.6).\r
Theorem 6.1. Let A be a pseudo-differential operator with a symbol A(ξ) ∈\r

Conversely, if AΘ\r

and, consequently, (6.1) holds.\r
The proof of the theorem is complete. \u0003\r
The following particular statement was proved in [3].\r
Corollary 6.1. ( [3]) Let A be a homogeneous pseudo-differential operator with\r
a symbol A(ξ) ∈ E(Qn\r

p-ADIC MULTIDIMENSIONAL WAVELETS AND THEIR\r
APPLICATION TO p-ADIC PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL\r
OPERATORS\r
A. YU. KHRENNIKOV AND V. M. SHELKOVICH\r
Abstract. In this paper we study some problems related with the theory\r
of multidimensional p-adic wavelets in connection with the theory of mul\u0002tidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators (in the p-adic Lizorkin\r
space). We introduce a new class of n-dimensional p-adic compactly sup\u0002ported wavelets. In one-dimensional case this class includes the Kozyrev\r
p-adic wavelets. These wavelets (and their Fourier transforms) form an or\u0002thonormal complete basis in L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
). A criterion for a multidimensional\r
p-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is\r
derived. We prove that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the Taible\u0002son fractional operator. Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential\r
operators (fractional operator), these results can be intensively used in ap\u0002plications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets are used to construct solutions of\r
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations."""

differential equations use pseudo-differential operators and the theory of p\u0002adic distributions (generalized functions) (see the above mentioned papers and\r
books). In particular, fractional operators Dα = f−α∗ are extensively used,\r
where fα is the p-adic Riesz kernel, ∗ is a convolution. However, in general,\r
Dαϕ 6∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
) for ϕ ∈ D(Qn\r
p\r
), where D(Qn\r
p\r
) is the space of test functions.\r
Consequently, the operation Dαf is well defined only for some distributions\r
f ∈ D′(Qn\r
p\r
). For example, D−1is defined only on the test functions such that\r
R\r
Qp\r
ϕ(x) dx = 0 [30, IX.2].\r
We recall that similar problems arise for the “C-case” fractional operators\r
(where all functions and distributions are complex or real valued defined on\r
spaces with real or complex coordinates): in general, the Schwartzian test\r
function space S(R\r
n\r
) is not invariant under fractional operators [26], [27]. To\r
solve this problem, in the excellent papers of P. I. Lizorkin [24], [25] a new type\r
spaces invariant under fractional operators were introduced (see also [26], [27]).\r
Taking into account the problems mentioned above, in [3], the p-adic Li\u0002zorkin spaces of test functions and distributions were introduced, and in [3], [4]\r
a class of pseudo-differential operators (including the Taibleson fractional op\u0002erator) defined on them was constructed. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant\r
under our pseudo-differential operators, and consequently, these spaces are\r
their “natural” definition domains and can play a key role in considerations\r
related to the fractional operators problems.\r
Recall that for the one-dimensional case the orthonormal complete basis\r
of eigenfunctions (5.5) of the Vladimirov operator Dα was constructed by\r
S. V. Kozyrev [20]. The eigenfunctions (5.5) are p-adic compactly supported\r
wavelets. Further development and generalization of the theory of such type\r
wavelets can be found in the papers by S. V. Kozyrev [21], [22], A. Yu. Khren\u0002nikov, and S. V. Kozyrev [16], [17], J. J. Benedetto, and R. L. Benedetto [8],\r
and R. L. Benedetto [9].\r
It is typical that such type p-adic compactly supported wavelets are eigen\u0002functions of p-adic pseudo-differential operators. Moreover, these wavelets\r
satisfy the condition R\r
Qp\r
ϕ(x) dx = 0 (see [20]), and, in view of Lemma 3.1,\r
belong to the Lizorkin space Φ(Qp). In [3], there waqs derived the necessary\r
and sufficient condition for multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential opera\u0002tors to have such type multidimensional wavelets as eigenfunctions. Thus the\r
wavelets theory play a key role in p-adic analysis.\r
Contents of the paper. In this paper problems related with the theory of\r
multidimensional p-adic pseudo-differential operators and the theory of multi\u0002dimensional p-adic wavelets are studied. Here the results of our paper [3] are\r
intensively used.\r
In Sec. 2, we recall some facts from the p-adic theory of distributions [12],\r
[28], [29], [30]. In Sec. 3, some facts from the theory of the p-adic Lizorkin

p-ADIC WAVELETS AND p-ADIC PSEUDO-DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS 3\r
spaces [3] are recalled. In Sec. 4, we recall some facts on the multidimen\u0002sional pseudo-differential operators defined in the Lizorkin space of distribu\u0002tions D′\r
(Qn\r
p\r
). The fractional Taibleson operator [28, §2], [29, III.4.] is among\r
them. The Lizorkin spaces are invariant under our pseudo-differential opera\u0002tors. It is appropriate to mention here that the class of our operators includes\r
the pseudo-differential operators studied in [19], [33], [34].\r
In Sec. 5, a new type of p-adic compactly supported wavelets (in one- di\u0002mensional (5.3) and multidimensional (5.17) cases) are introduced. These\r
wavelets belong to the Lizorkin space of test functions. The Kozyrev one\u0002dimensional wavelets [20] (see (5.5)) is a particular case of our one-dimensional\r
wavelets (5.3). The scaling function of wavelets (5.3) is a characteristic func\u0002tion of the unit disc. The two-scale equation (5.7) for these wavelets is pre\u0002sented. However, in this paper the multiresolution analysis is not considered.\r
The one-dimensional wavelets (5.3) and multidimensional wavelets (5.17) form\r
orthonormal complete bases in L\r
2\r
(Qp) and L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
), respectively (see Theo\u0002rems 5.1, 5.2). Their Fourier transforms also form orthonormal complete bases\r
in L\r
2\r
(Qp) and L\r
2\r
(Qn\r
p\r
), respectively (see Corollary 5.1, 5.2).\r
In Sec. 6, the spectral theory of our pseudo-differential operators is con\u0002structed. By Theorem 6.1 the criterion (6.1) for multidimensional p-adic\r
pseudo-differential operators (3.2) to have multidimensional wavelets (5.17) as\r
eigenfunctions is derived. In particular, the multidimensional wavelets (5.17)\r
are eigenfunctions of the Taibleson fractional operator (see (6.6)).\r
Since many p-adic models use pseudo-differential operators, in particular,\r
fractional operator, these results on p-adic wavelets can be intensively used in\r
applications. Moreover, p-adic wavelets can be used to construct solutions of\r
linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations [5], [18], [23].\r
2. p-Adic distributions\r
Now we recall some facts from the theory of p-adic distributions (generalized\r
functions). We shall systematically use the notations and results from [30]. Let\r

where Bγ(aj ) = {xj: |xj − aj|p ≤ p\r

a point aj ∈ Qp, j = 1, 2 . . . , n. Any two balls in Qn\r
p\r
either are disjoint or one\r
contains the other. Every point of the ball is its center.\r
According to [30, I.3,Examples 1,2.], the disc Bγ is represented by the sum\r

We call covering (2.3), (2.4) the canonical covering of the disc B0.\r
A complex-valued function f defined on Qn\r
p\r
is called locally-constant if for\r
any x ∈ Qn\r
p\r
there exists an integer l(x) ∈ Z such that\r
f(x + y) = f(x), y ∈ B\r

Let E(Qn\r

The largest of such numbers l = l(ϕ) is called the parameter of constancy of\r

Let us introduce in D(Qn\r

Here ∆k(x) is the characteristic function of the ball Bn\r

We define the Fourier transform F[f] of a distribution f ∈ D′(Qn\r

Let A be a matrix and b ∈ Qn\r

In particular, F[Ω(|ξ|p)](x) = Ω(|x|p).\r
The convolution f ∗ g for distributions f, g ∈ D′(Qn\r

of distributions. If for distributions f, g ∈ D′(Qn\r

then [30, VII,(5.4)]\r
(2.12) F[f ∗ g] = F[f]F[g].\r
It is well known (see, e.g., [30, III.2.]) that any multiplicative character π of\r

Proof. In view of (2.7) and results of Sec. 3, functions F[φ](ξ) and A(ξ)F[φ](ξ)\r

6. p-Adic wavelets as eigenfunctions of pseudo-differential\r
operators\r
6.1. Pseudo-differential operators. As mentioned above, the one- dimen\u0002sional Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) introduced in [20] is a particular case of the\r
wavelets (5.3) for m = 1. Moreover, in [20] S. V. Kozyrev proved that his\r

Dαfor α > 0:\r

θγja(x) = p\r
α(1−γ)\r
θγja(x), x ∈ Qp,\r
where γ ∈ Z, a ∈ Ip, j = 1, 2, . . . p − 1. Later, it was proved in [3, 4.4.] that in\r
fact, the Kozyrev wavelets (5.5) are eigenfunctions of the Vladimirov operator\r
for any α, i.e., the above formula holds for all α ∈ C.\r
Now we prove that n-dimensional wavelets (5.17) are eigenfunctions for a\r
class of pseudo-differential operators (4.1), which includes the Taibleson frac\u0002tional operator (4.10), (4.6).\r
Theorem 6.1. Let A be a pseudo-differential operator with a symbol A(ξ) ∈\r

In view of formulas (5.17), (6.2), (2.9), we have\r

Let condition (6.1) be satisfied. Then (4.1), (6.3) imply\r

Consequently, AΘ\r

Conversely, if AΘ\r

γsa (x) = λΘ\r

and, consequently, (6.1) holds.\r
The proof of the theorem is complete. \u0003\r
The following particular statement was proved in [3].\r
Corollary 6.1. ( [3]) Let A be a homogeneous pseudo-differential operator with\r
a symbol A(ξ) ∈ E(Qn\r
p\r
\\ {0}) of degree πβ. Then the n-direct product Θγja(x)\r
of the one-dimensional Kozyrev p-adic wavelets (5.5), i.e., the n-dimensional\r
p-adic wavelet (5.17) Θ(1)\r
γsa (for m = 1) is an eigenfunction of A if and only if\r
(6.5) A(−p\r

Here the eigenvalue λ = p\r
(1−β)γA(−p−1\r

AΘγja(x) = p\r
(1−β)γA(−p−1\r
