The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and\r
the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understand\u0002ing of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems.\r
Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the\r
interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend\r
a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydro\u0002dynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic\r
attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with\r
RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as\r
hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict\r
both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss\r
that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Understanding the emergence of collective behavior in\r
small collision systems, such as pp and pA collisions, re\u0002mains one of the central challenges for both the high\u0002energy physics and heavy-ion communities since their\r
discovery at the LHC more than a decade ago [1–4] (for\r
recent reviews, see [5–7]). While the dynamical origin of\r
this collectivity is still under investigation, hydrodynamic\r
models, originally thought to be valid only for large sys\u0002tems such as AA collisions, have proven quantitatively\r
successful in describing several low-momentum observ\u0002ables in small systems as well [8–11] (a non-exhaustive\r
list of alternative explanations includes [12–17]).\r
This hydrodynamic picture requires the presence of a\r
deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), implying final\u0002state interactions and consequently jet quenching [18–20].\r
In AA collisions, jet modifications are firmly established,\r
and their dependence on the medium size is consistent\r
with expectations from parton energy-loss calculations\r
performed using perturbative QCD or holographic tech\u0002niques [21–24]. However, in pA collisions, jet quenching\r
remains elusive, possibly due to the short path lengths\r
involved [25–28]. Despite the absence of measurable en\u0002ergy loss, significant azimuthal anisotropies have been\r
observed in high-pT particles in pA systems [29–31]. In\r
AA collisions, this anisotropy is understood in terms of\r
differences in energy loss due to the different path lengths\r

traversed as a function of the jet orientation with respect\r
to the reaction plane of the collision [32, 33], adding fur\u0002ther puzzling elements to the picture we attempt to draw\r
for small systems.\r
Recent LHC runs on OO and NeNe collisions have\r
provided a valuable bridge between small (pp and pA)\r
and large (such as PbPb and AuAu) collision systems,\r
thereby reducing uncertainties related to short path\r
lengths and centrality determination [34–37]. In these\r
smaller systems, fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium dy\u0002namics are believed to play an increasingly critical role\r
in achieving quantitative precision [38–41].\r
In this work, we extend our semi-analytic jet quench\u0002ing framework [42–44] by incorporating these elements to\r
enable reliable predictions for the upcoming experimen\u0002tal results on the potential existence of jet quenching\r
effects in OO collisions. We account for medium fluc\u0002tuations by coupling the framework to state-of-the-art\r
event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of the expand\u0002ing fireball within which jets are produced and subse\u0002quently traverse. Before hydrodynamics is believed to be\r
applicable, we incorporate quenching effects during the\r
pre-equilibrium phase via the hydrodynamic attractor ex\u0002tracted from QCD kinetic theory, representing the first\r
time this is done in a realistic model for jet quenching.\r
We benchmark our model against a broad set of AA\r
data, including both LHC and RHIC energies and col\u0002lision systems, spanning wide ranges in centrality, jet\r
cone size and transverse momentum. Using Bayesian pa\u0002rameter estimation, we achieve a simultaneous and con\u0002sistent description of jet suppression R\r

constraints on energy-loss effects in the pre-equilibrium\r
phase. The resulting posterior distributions can then be\r
used to predict jet and hadron observables in other colli\u0002sion systems, including OO as we do in the present work.\r
II. FRAMEWORK\r
Our jet quenching framework builds on previous re\u0002sults from [42–44], which we briefly summarize here. We\r
introduce two key new components: (i) the coupling to\r
event-by-event fluctuating hydrodynamics, and (ii) en\u0002ergy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase using the hydro\u0002dynamic attractor.\r
Our starting point is the vacuum jet cross section,\r
σ\r
pp\r
i\r
(pT , R), computed using MadGraph+Pythia [45–47] at\r
NLO+LL accuracy. We reconstructed jets and assigned\r
their flavor (i = q/g) with the Flavor-kt [48]. Nuclear\r
PDF (nPDF) effects are incorporated using EPPS21 [49]\r
within the LHAPDF [50] framework, yielding the modified\r
cross section σ˜\r
pp(pT , R). The charged hadron spectrum\r
is evaluated by convoluting this jet spectrum with the\r
NPC23 [51] fragmentation function (FF).\r
The quenched jet cross section is described via the con\u0002volution of the nPDF-modified jet cross section with the\r
energy-loss probability distribution:\r
σ\r
AA(pT , R) = X\r
i=q,g\r
Z\r
dεPi(ε, R, pT )˜σ\r
pp\r
i\r
(pT + ε, R). (1)\r
Energy is lost predominantly due to medium-induced\r
emissions escaping the jet cone R, as encoded in\r
Pi(ε, R, pT ). The emission rate is computed using the\r
Improved Opacity Expansion in a static medium, which\r
captures both single hard and multiple soft scatterings,\r
and also includes finite path length corrections [52, 53].\r
Medium properties affect these rates through LO Hard\r
Thermal Loop results, namely the (bare) jet quench\u0002ing parameter qˆ0 = g\r
2\r
medNcm2\r
DT /(4π), and the Debye\r
screening mass m2\r
D = 3g\r
2\r
medT\r
2/2, where T is the local\r
temperature of the hydrodynamic medium. Here, gmed\r
is the (fixed, i.e. non-running) strong coupling for jet\u0002medium interactions, representing the first of the two pa\u0002rameters we will estimate using Bayesian inference. We\r
assume factorization between induced collinear emissions\r
and transverse momentum broadening: semi-hard emis\u0002sions undergo Gaussian broadening, while hard emissions\r
inherit their transverse momentum from the Coulomb\r
tail of the scattering potential. Since the softest emis\u0002sions thermalize rapidly [54], they should be considered\r
part of the medium and contribute to hydrodynamic\r
wakes [55, 56], a manifestation of medium response to\r
the jet passage. We approximate these physics by as\u0002suming that the thermalized energy is distributed uni\u0002formly around the jet hemisphere. Elastic energy loss is\r
also included and constrained via the Einstein relation\r
eˆ = ˆq/(4T), and is assumed to thermalize in a similar\r
fashion. Here, qˆ accounts for the logarithmic corrections\r
of qˆ0 (see later).\r
Energetic jets consist of multiple partons produced\r
by the high-virtuality DGLAP evolution that occurs at\r
the early stages of the in-medium jet propagation [57].\r
These partons represent an additional source of energy\r
loss. We account for this by resumming these multiple\r
sources via a factorization between early vacuum-like and\r
medium-induced emissions [58]. Importantly, we also in\u0002clude color-coherence, and -resolution [59–61] effects (re\u0002ferred to as coherent energy loss) by incorporating the\r
non-local angular scale below which the medium cannot\r
resolve individual partons, θc ∼ 1/\r
p\r
qLˆ\r
3, with L being\r
the traversed medium length. Detailed formulas are pro\u0002vided in [44].\r
Jet propagation occurs within an event-by-event fluc\u0002tuating 2+1D hydrodynamic background. We employ\r
hydro profiles from the comprehensive multi-stage frame\u0002work IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD, which success\u0002fully describes a wide range of bulk observables in\r
heavy-ion collisions [62]. This state-of-the-art frame\u0002work evolves the bulk starting from the initial energy\r
density deposited at specific hotspots determined by the\r
IPSat [63]. Jet probes are placed precisely onto these\r
hotspots, whose number is proportional to the number\r
of binary collisions Ncoll, and their initial orientation is\r
uniformly distributed in the azimuthal angle ϕ. Straight\r
jet trajectories are sampled from their production point\r
until they exit the deconfined medium at T < Tc, with\r
Tc marks the crossover transition to the hadron gas\r
phase. The medium and jet-medium interaction quan\u0002tities needed for the computation of radiative and elastic\r
energy loss are then obtained by averaging along each jet\r
trajectory, as extracted from the hydrodynamic profiles.\r
We neglect further quenching below Tc. For more de\u0002tails on the embedding of our jet quenching framework in\r
the realistic heavy-ion environment, see Ref. [44], where\r
event-averaged hydro profiles were used instead. Event\r
classification into centrality classes is based on the final\r
charged particle multiplicity of the bulk, from which one\r
also extracts the soft event-plane angles Ψn, necessary for\r
computing the jet flow coefficients. Thus, our framework\r
predicts the quenched jet spectrum for various parame\u0002ters σ\r
AA%(pT , η, ϕ, R).\r
The hydrodynamic description of the bulk begins at a\r
finite time τhyd = 0.4 fm. The initial condition of this\r
nearly ideal fluid is reached through the Glasma evolution\r
of saturated gluon fields (for reviews on this approach to\r
thermalization, see [64, 65]). Quenching effects have tra\u0002ditionally been neglected before this time, largely due\r
to the absence of reliable energy-loss calculations in the\r
non-equilibrated phase. While an earlier start could be\r
mimicked by adjusting the jet-medium coupling, com\u0002bined observables such as high-pT RAA and v2 are known\r
to be sensitive to the actual value of the quenching onset\r
time [66, 67]. The need to address jet quenching in the\r
earliest stages has been emphasized in recent works where\r
the pre-hydro phase is modeled either by Glasma [68, 69]\r
or by QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) [70, 71]. De\u0002spite differences in approach, these studies consistently

3\r
conclude that the broadening per unit length in the short\r
pre-equilibrium phase is considerably larger than in the\r
equilibrated hydro phase.\r
In the present work, we extend our energy loss frame\u0002work to the pre-equilibrium stage as follows. The out\u0002of-equilibrium evolution of the local energy density has\r
been extensively studied in EKT [72–77], and it is well\r
captured by the hydrodynamic attractor. We use the at\u0002tractor to extrapolate the effective local temperature for\r
times τ earlier than τhyd as [78, 79]:\r
(τ\r
1/3T)4\r
eff = (τ\r
1/3T)4\r
hyd · E(˜ω). (2)\r
where E(˜ω) is the attractor function, ω˜ = τTeff/(4πη/s),\r
and we implicitly used the the three flavor conformal\r
equation of state of the EKT. We account for viscous\r
corrections as\r
(τ\r
1/3T)hyd = τ\r
1/3\r
hyd \u0012\r
T(x) + 2\r
3\r
η/s\r
τhyd \u0013\r
, (3)\r
with η/s = 0.12, where T(x) is the local initial tempera\u0002ture. We assume that our energy-loss model can be ap\u0002plied without any additional modification by using these\r
extrapolated pre-equilibrium temperatures. Before τmin,\r
no quenching is applied, and we take this time as the\r
second parameter of our Bayesian inference.\r
Finally, fluid velocity fields also evolve during the pre\u0002equilibrium phase, as initial spatial anisotropies begin to\r
generate flow [65]. This non-equilibrium evolution is well\r
approximated by the universal pre-flow extracted from\r
EKT [80]. We incorporate it by scaling the transverse\r
velocity linearly with time:\r
veff,T (τ, ⃗x) = τ\r
τhyd\r
vT (τhyd, ⃗x),\r
veff,z(τ ) = tanh ηs ,\r
(4)\r
where the longitudinal velocity scales with the space-time\r
rapidity ηs.\r

medium effects in fragmentation, and thus ignores, for\r
example, the impact of the angular redistribution of par\u0002ticles due to broadening.\r
Our work resembles previous studies of RAA and\r
v2 [66, 67, 82–96]. In contrast to these works, we fo\u0002cus on jets instead of hadrons, since jets are infrared\u0002and collinear-safe, and have small non-perturbative cor\u0002rections in vacuum [97–100]. We use state-of-the-art hy\u0002drodynamics and energy-loss formulas, including elastic\r
energy loss as well as the effects of medium response. To\r
our knowledge, this is the first model implementation of\r
jet energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase carried out\r
in a physically well-motivated manner.\r
We employ Bayesian inference, implemented via the\r
JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103], to constrain the jet\u0002medium strong coupling gmed and the initial quench\u0002ing time in the pre-equilibrium phase τmin. We used\r
flat priors in the intervals 1.2 ≤ gmed ≤ 1.7, and\r
0.01 ≤ τmin [fm] ≤ 0.4. Our data points include R\r
jet\r
AA\r
at LHC energies for different jet-cones and centrality se\u0002lections [104–106], as well as jet v\r
jet\r
2\r
[81], up to 40-50%\r
centrality. The inference incorporates statistical and sys\u0002tematic uncertainties of the data, and we estimate the\r
full correlation matrix by employing a finite correlation\r
length of 0.2 [102, 107]. Luminosity and centrality uncer\u0002tainties are added to the systematics. We neglect inher\u0002ent model uncertainties in the inference such as scale and\r
nPDF uncertainties, and we will present them separately

Figure. 1 shows the parameter posterior for two dif\u0002ferent scenarios. Fitting only R\r
jet\r
AA (blue) results in little\r
constraint on τmin. This is expected, as an earlier starting\r
time can be compensated by a relatively smaller medium\r
coupling to produce the same energy loss. Including v\r
jet\r
2\r
constrains τmin ≈ 0.24 fm (red). This inference illustrates\r
the role of pre-equilibrium effects in v\r
jet\r
2\r
.\r
Before moving to our predictions for oxygen collisions,\r
Fig. 4 in App. A shows the posterior predictive distri\u0002butions. We observe excellent overall agreement with all\r
data. Small tensions can be found in v\r
jet\r
2\r
at low pT , which\r
motivates further improvements of the energy loss frame\u0002work. For completeness, we also show inference results on\r
gmed with two limiting scenarios: early pre-equilibrium\r
with fixed τmin = 0.08 fm, and no pre-equilibrium with\r
τmin = 0.4 fm. The best fit (whose parameters are shown\r
in Fig. 1) outperforms these two scenarios, although dif\u0002ferences are not very significant. The extracted bare\r
jet transport coefficient is approximately qˆ0/T3 ≈ 1.7,\r
while after logarithmic corrections the effective value is\r
q/T ˆ\r
3 = ˆq0/T3\r
log(Q2\r

) ≈ 7, where Q2\r
s = ˆq0L, and\r

De\r
−2+2γE /4. We note that this extracted qˆ is\r
consistent with other recent extractions using Bayesian\r
inference in the JETSCAPE framework [103].\r
Figure 5 in App. A provides predictions for jets at\r
RHIC energies [108] and charged hadrons at LHC en\u0002ergies [109–112] using the extracted parameters. Even\r
though our framework was designed for jets, it also pro\u0002vides a good description of the charged hadron RAA with\u0002out including them in the inference. We also see, how\u0002ever, that our framework underestimates hadron elliptic\r
flow at low pT . This failure is consistent with previous\r
findings using pQCD energy loss [66, 67]. It has been\r
pointed out that a rather late quenching time of around\r
∼ 1 fm would resolve the disagreement [67]. Alterna\u0002tively, the absence of this issue for jets signals the need\r
for model improvements which could be more relevant\r
for (mid-pT ) hadrons than for jets. Again, for complete\u0002ness, we show predictions with the previous two limiting\r
scenarios (early pre-eq. and no pre-eq. energy loss), re\u0002sulting as before in subtle differences.\r
OO predictions: The recent OO run at the LHC has\r
attracted considerable attention, with numerous dedi\u0002cated studies on, for example, baseline analyses [113–\r
116] and hadron quenching predictions [117–125]. Com\u0002pared to these studies, our framework incorporates ad\u0002ditional improvements, with an emphasis on jet observ\u0002ables. For our OO predictions of RAA and v2 we have set\r
√\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV and |η| < 2.1. We defer to future work\r
the computation of higher-order flow harmonics, along\r
with the corresponding predictions for NeNe collisions.\r
Figure 2 shows our jet and charged hadron predictions\r
for OO collisions. The left panel shows the inclusive jet\r
suppression, where the no-quenching baseline, σ˜\r
pp/σpp\r
,\r
is indicated with gray bands. The dark band represents\r
NLO scale uncertainties, while the light band is the 68%\r
confidence of the nPDF. Below 50 GeV for jets and 30\r
GeV for hadrons, we underestimate nPDF uncertainties\r
because of the relatively high momentum cutoff we chose\r
for the NLO cross-sections [115, 116]. This cutoff does\r
not affect the central value. Quenching effects are shown\r
with red and blue for different centrality selections. Dark\r
bands are the 68% confidence of our Bayesian parameter\r
estimation, and on top of these, 68% nPDF uncertain\u0002ties are shown with light bands. Peripheral collisions\r
(30-100%) are less suppressed than central ones (0-30%),\r
as expected, and clear quenching signals are present to\u0002wards lower jet pT for both centrality selections. The\r

sion, which presents a similar pattern to jets.\r
Figure 3 shows the inclusive jet and charged hadron\r
elliptic flow. There is relatively smaller sensitivity to\r
the nPDF, as v2 is an observable that is differential in\r
the transverse plane, using solely the medium spectra,\r
so the impact of the nPDF largely cancels in Eq. (5).\r
Semi-inclusive observables can present analogous advan\u0002tages [115]. We observe that, in contrast to large collision\r
systems, the elliptic flow coefficient v2 increases with cen\u0002trality. This is a consequence of the more prominent role\r
played by the fluctuations of the initial nuclear shape in\r
small collision systems [117, 119, 126]. Jet distributions\r
are not shown for very low pT , where our framework is\r
not expected to apply.\r
Due to the relatively small path lengths involved in\r
OO, the typical value of the coherence angle is relatively\r
large, θc ∼ 0.5, and so R = 0.4 jets are unresolved and\r
lose energy as single color charges. Therefore, hadron\r
and jet suppression in our framework can be understood\r
by the mere pT shift resulting from hadronization. In\r
contrast, in larger systems (with smaller values of θc)\r
both RAA and v2 receive additional contributions due to\r
resolved jet substructure fluctuations [44, 127].\r
Finally, Fig. 6 in App. B shows our OO predictions\r
for minimum bias with the different limiting cases intro\u0002duced previously. Only subtle differences are observed\r
for earlier vs. later quenching for the ranges of τmin ex\u0002plored.\r
IV. CONCLUSIONS\r
In this work, we have integrated our semi-analytical jet\r
quenching model with a state-of-the-art description of\r
heavy-ion collisions, IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD.\r
We incorporated energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase\r
via the hydrodynamic attractor for the first time. Our\r
framework provides a simultaneous description of jet\r
RAA and v2 in agreement with data in AA collisions, of\u0002fering a strong validation of the approach. We show that\r
a joint description of these observables places constraints\r
on the onset time of jet-medium interactions, which is\r
around 0.2 fm, deep in the pre-equilibrium phase. Then,\r
we applied these parameters to predict jet and hadron\r
quenching in other collision systems. We saw that our\r
framework successfully predicts hadron suppression but\r
underestimates hadron elliptic flow towards lower pT .\r
Previous studies have reported similar results, suggesting\r
that a delayed onset of quenching of about 1 fm could ac\u0002count for the hadron experimental data. Our success in\r
describing jets, however, would rather suggest the need to\r
account for additional medium effects whose importance\r
could grow at lower pT .\r
Our constrained framework has been used to make\r
realistic predictions for the intermediate-sized OO col\u0002lisions. We obtained sizable energy loss both for jets and\r
charged hadrons, in quantitative agreement with the pre\u0002liminary results from CMS [128]. Even though we have\r
shown that pre-equilibrium effects play a moderate role\r
in our model, we anticipate that including forthcoming\r
data on high-pT flow coefficients will result in further\r
constraints. Furthermore, in this work we have provided\r
predictions for elliptic anisotropies and different central\u0002ity selections, both for hadrons and jets. Due to the\r
small path lengths in OO, unlike in PbPb or AuAu, jet\r
constituents are barely resolved (jets are fully coherent),\r
and thus we obtain similar energy loss for hadrons and\r
jets (modulo a pT shift in fragmentation). This outcome\r
constitutes a prediction of our framework which can be\r
confronted with future experimental results on jet sup\u0002pression in light ions.\r
As an outlook, our jet quenching framework could ben\u0002efit from an improved description of medium-induced\r
emissions, elastic scatterings, and medium response in\r
several ways. It is important to note that, at very\r
early times, local color fields are saturated and highly\r
anisotropic, a scenario which our energy-loss framework,\r
built on local equilibrium, cannot accommodate. For\r
these initial stages, it would be desirable to incorpo\u0002rate recent developments in energy-loss calculations for\r
anisotropic media [129–134], correlated color fields [135],\r
and out of-equilibrium plasma [136, 137], so as to extend\r
quenching for those earliest times where the attractor so\u0002lution is not meant to apply.

Appendix A: Bayesian parameter estimation\r
We have already introduced our Bayesian framework\r
in Sec. II, and here we extend this discussion by provid\u0002ing additional details. In this appendix, PbPb and AuAu\r
cross-sections σ˜\r
AA(pT , η, R) are computed using the mi\u0002crojet evolution as employed in [42, 44], with initial con\u0002ditions from LO Pythia at R0 = 1. Our framework is\r
built on the JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103]. We eval\u0002uated our model for 24 design points, equally distributed\r
in the parameter space. To focus on primary model fea\u0002tures that are robust against statistical uncertainty, we\r
reduced our data to its 10 principal components, and\r
trained a Gaussian Process Emulator to interpolate be\u0002tween the predictions. The resulting parameter posterior\r
is shown in the main text in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we pro\u0002vide two alternative inferences for gmed: one with fixed\r
τmin = 0.08 fm, (and extracted ⟨gmed⟩ = 1.385) referred\r
to as “early preeq”, and another with τmin = 0.4 fm, (ex\u0002tracted ⟨gmed⟩ = 1.473), referred to as “no preeq”.\r
Figure 4 shows the corresponding posterior predictive\r
distributions. These jet data were used to constrain the\r
model parameters. Different rows correspond to differ\u0002ent measurements. We observe good agreement with all\r
data for both R\r
jet\r
AA and v\r
jet\r
2\r
, including all collision ener\u0002gies, centralities, rapidities, jet cone sizes, and momenta.\r
There is a slight tension in v\r
jet\r
2\r
for the lowest pT bins.\r
This tension could be do to missing ingredients in the\r
description of energy loss towards lower pT . Dotted and\r
dashed lines show the two alternative fits, where τmin is\r
kept fixed. There are subtle differences between different\r
fits, with the fixed earlier quenching reducing the jet v2,\r
as expected.\r
Finally, we also compare our results to jets at RHIC\r
energies and charged hadron observables, shown in\r
Fig. 5. As our framework was designed for jets, we did\r
not include these data in the inference. We see an overall\r
good agreement with both RHIC energies and charged\r
hadron RAA. Interestingly, hadron RAA seems to favor\r
early quenching, as indicated by the dashed lines. There\r
is a clear underestimation of the hadron elliptic flow at\r
low momenta, consistent with previous findings from\r
other theory collaborations, likely linked to the (milder)\r
tension with low pT jets mentioned above.\r
Appendix B: OO predictions without\r
pre-equilibrium quenching\r
Figure 6 shows the nuclear modification and elliptic\r
flow for minimum bias OO collisions. Curves represent\r
the limiting scenarios tested in App. A regarding pre\u0002equilibrium quenching: “early preeq” denotes τmin = 0.08\r
fm, “no preeq” τmin = 0.4 fm, with their corresponding\r
inferred gmed. The best fit denotes our default setting\r
shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity, we don’t show nPDF\r
uncertainties. Slight differences are present in the differ\u0002ent limiting scenarios. Interestingly, an earlier quenching\r
can result in a relatively larger v2, in contrast to larger\r
systems, likely reflecting the more important role of fluc\u0002tuations over average geometry in smaller systems.\r

The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and\r
the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understand\u0002ing of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems.\r
Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the\r
interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend\r
a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydro\u0002dynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic\r
attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with\r
RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as\r
hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict\r
both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss\r
that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Understanding the emergence of collective behavior in\r
small collision systems, such as pp and pA collisions, re\u0002mains one of the central challenges for both the high\u0002energy physics and heavy-ion communities since their\r
discovery at the LHC more than a decade ago [1–4] (for\r
recent reviews, see [5–7]). While the dynamical origin of\r
this collectivity is still under investigation, hydrodynamic\r
models, originally thought to be valid only for large sys\u0002tems such as AA collisions, have proven quantitatively\r
successful in describing several low-momentum observ\u0002ables in small systems as well [8–11] (a non-exhaustive\r
list of alternative explanations includes [12–17]).\r
This hydrodynamic picture requires the presence of a\r
deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), implying final\u0002state interactions and consequently jet quenching [18–20].\r
In AA collisions, jet modifications are firmly established,\r
and their dependence on the medium size is consistent\r
with expectations from parton energy-loss calculations\r
performed using perturbative QCD or holographic tech\u0002niques [21–24]. However, in pA collisions, jet quenching\r
remains elusive, possibly due to the short path lengths\r
involved [25–28]. Despite the absence of measurable en\u0002ergy loss, significant azimuthal anisotropies have been\r
observed in high-pT particles in pA systems [29–31]. In\r
AA collisions, this anisotropy is understood in terms of\r
differences in energy loss due to the different path lengths\r

traversed as a function of the jet orientation with respect\r
to the reaction plane of the collision [32, 33], adding fur\u0002ther puzzling elements to the picture we attempt to draw\r
for small systems.\r
Recent LHC runs on OO and NeNe collisions have\r
provided a valuable bridge between small (pp and pA)\r
and large (such as PbPb and AuAu) collision systems,\r
thereby reducing uncertainties related to short path\r
lengths and centrality determination [34–37]. In these\r
smaller systems, fluctuations and out-of-equilibrium dy\u0002namics are believed to play an increasingly critical role\r
in achieving quantitative precision [38–41].\r
In this work, we extend our semi-analytic jet quench\u0002ing framework [42–44] by incorporating these elements to\r
enable reliable predictions for the upcoming experimen\u0002tal results on the potential existence of jet quenching\r
effects in OO collisions. We account for medium fluc\u0002tuations by coupling the framework to state-of-the-art\r
event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of the expand\u0002ing fireball within which jets are produced and subse\u0002quently traverse. Before hydrodynamics is believed to be\r
applicable, we incorporate quenching effects during the\r
pre-equilibrium phase via the hydrodynamic attractor ex\u0002tracted from QCD kinetic theory, representing the first\r
time this is done in a realistic model for jet quenching.\r
We benchmark our model against a broad set of AA\r
data, including both LHC and RHIC energies and col\u0002lision systems, spanning wide ranges in centrality, jet\r
cone size and transverse momentum. Using Bayesian pa\u0002rameter estimation, we achieve a simultaneous and con\u0002sistent description of jet suppression R\r

phase. The resulting posterior distributions can then be\r
used to predict jet and hadron observables in other colli\u0002sion systems, including OO as we do in the present work.\r
II. FRAMEWORK\r
Our jet quenching framework builds on previous re\u0002sults from [42–44], which we briefly summarize here. We\r
introduce two key new components: (i) the coupling to\r
event-by-event fluctuating hydrodynamics, and (ii) en\u0002ergy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase using the hydro\u0002dynamic attractor.\r
Our starting point is the vacuum jet cross section,\r
σ\r
pp\r
i\r
(pT , R), computed using MadGraph+Pythia [45–47] at\r
NLO+LL accuracy. We reconstructed jets and assigned\r
their flavor (i = q/g) with the Flavor-kt [48]. Nuclear\r
PDF (nPDF) effects are incorporated using EPPS21 [49]\r
within the LHAPDF [50] framework, yielding the modified\r
cross section σ˜\r
pp(pT , R). The charged hadron spectrum\r
is evaluated by convoluting this jet spectrum with the\r
NPC23 [51] fragmentation function (FF).\r
The quenched jet cross section is described via the con\u0002volution of the nPDF-modified jet cross section with the\r
energy-loss probability distribution:\r
σ\r
AA(pT , R) = X\r
i=q,g\r
Z\r
dεPi(ε, R, pT )˜σ\r
pp\r
i\r
(pT + ε, R). (1)\r
Energy is lost predominantly due to medium-induced\r
emissions escaping the jet cone R, as encoded in\r
Pi(ε, R, pT ). The emission rate is computed using the\r
Improved Opacity Expansion in a static medium, which\r
captures both single hard and multiple soft scatterings,\r
and also includes finite path length corrections [52, 53].\r
Medium properties affect these rates through LO Hard\r
Thermal Loop results, namely the (bare) jet quench\u0002ing parameter qˆ0 = g\r
2\r
medNcm2\r
DT /(4π), and the Debye\r
screening mass m2\r
D = 3g\r
2\r
medT\r
2/2, where T is the local\r
temperature of the hydrodynamic medium. Here, gmed\r
is the (fixed, i.e. non-running) strong coupling for jet\u0002medium interactions, representing the first of the two pa\u0002rameters we will estimate using Bayesian inference. We\r
assume factorization between induced collinear emissions\r
and transverse momentum broadening: semi-hard emis\u0002sions undergo Gaussian broadening, while hard emissions\r
inherit their transverse momentum from the Coulomb\r
tail of the scattering potential. Since the softest emis\u0002sions thermalize rapidly [54], they should be considered\r
part of the medium and contribute to hydrodynamic\r
wakes [55, 56], a manifestation of medium response to\r
the jet passage. We approximate these physics by as\u0002suming that the thermalized energy is distributed uni\u0002formly around the jet hemisphere. Elastic energy loss is\r
also included and constrained via the Einstein relation\r
eˆ = ˆq/(4T), and is assumed to thermalize in a similar\r
fashion. Here, qˆ accounts for the logarithmic corrections\r
of qˆ0 (see later).\r
Energetic jets consist of multiple partons produced\r
by the high-virtuality DGLAP evolution that occurs at\r
the early stages of the in-medium jet propagation [57].\r
These partons represent an additional source of energy\r
loss. We account for this by resumming these multiple\r
sources via a factorization between early vacuum-like and\r
medium-induced emissions [58]. Importantly, we also in\u0002clude color-coherence, and -resolution [59–61] effects (re\u0002ferred to as coherent energy loss) by incorporating the\r
non-local angular scale below which the medium cannot\r
resolve individual partons, θc ∼ 1/\r
p\r
qLˆ\r
3, with L being\r
the traversed medium length. Detailed formulas are pro\u0002vided in [44].\r
Jet propagation occurs within an event-by-event fluc\u0002tuating 2+1D hydrodynamic background. We employ\r
hydro profiles from the comprehensive multi-stage frame\u0002work IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD, which success\u0002fully describes a wide range of bulk observables in\r
heavy-ion collisions [62]. This state-of-the-art frame\u0002work evolves the bulk starting from the initial energy\r
density deposited at specific hotspots determined by the\r
IPSat [63]. Jet probes are placed precisely onto these\r
hotspots, whose number is proportional to the number\r
of binary collisions Ncoll, and their initial orientation is\r
uniformly distributed in the azimuthal angle ϕ. Straight\r
jet trajectories are sampled from their production point\r
until they exit the deconfined medium at T < Tc, with\r
Tc marks the crossover transition to the hadron gas\r
phase. The medium and jet-medium interaction quan\u0002tities needed for the computation of radiative and elastic\r
energy loss are then obtained by averaging along each jet\r
trajectory, as extracted from the hydrodynamic profiles.\r
We neglect further quenching below Tc. For more de\u0002tails on the embedding of our jet quenching framework in\r
the realistic heavy-ion environment, see Ref. [44], where\r
event-averaged hydro profiles were used instead. Event\r
classification into centrality classes is based on the final\r
charged particle multiplicity of the bulk, from which one\r
also extracts the soft event-plane angles Ψn, necessary for\r
computing the jet flow coefficients. Thus, our framework\r
predicts the quenched jet spectrum for various parame\u0002ters σ\r
AA%(pT , η, ϕ, R).\r
The hydrodynamic description of the bulk begins at a\r
finite time τhyd = 0.4 fm. The initial condition of this\r
nearly ideal fluid is reached through the Glasma evolution\r
of saturated gluon fields (for reviews on this approach to\r
thermalization, see [64, 65]). Quenching effects have tra\u0002ditionally been neglected before this time, largely due\r
to the absence of reliable energy-loss calculations in the\r
non-equilibrated phase. While an earlier start could be\r
mimicked by adjusting the jet-medium coupling, com\u0002bined observables such as high-pT RAA and v2 are known\r
to be sensitive to the actual value of the quenching onset\r
time [66, 67]. The need to address jet quenching in the\r
earliest stages has been emphasized in recent works where\r
the pre-hydro phase is modeled either by Glasma [68, 69]\r
or by QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) [70, 71]. De\u0002spite differences in approach, these studies consistently

3\r
conclude that the broadening per unit length in the short\r
pre-equilibrium phase is considerably larger than in the\r
equilibrated hydro phase.\r
In the present work, we extend our energy loss frame\u0002work to the pre-equilibrium stage as follows. The out\u0002of-equilibrium evolution of the local energy density has\r
been extensively studied in EKT [72–77], and it is well\r
captured by the hydrodynamic attractor. We use the at\u0002tractor to extrapolate the effective local temperature for\r
times τ earlier than τhyd as [78, 79]:\r
(τ\r
1/3T)4\r
eff = (τ\r
1/3T)4\r
hyd · E(˜ω). (2)\r
where E(˜ω) is the attractor function, ω˜ = τTeff/(4πη/s),\r
and we implicitly used the the three flavor conformal\r
equation of state of the EKT. We account for viscous\r
corrections as\r
(τ\r
1/3T)hyd = τ\r
1/3\r
hyd \u0012\r
T(x) + 2\r
3\r
η/s\r
τhyd \u0013\r
, (3)\r
with η/s = 0.12, where T(x) is the local initial tempera\u0002ture. We assume that our energy-loss model can be ap\u0002plied without any additional modification by using these\r
extrapolated pre-equilibrium temperatures. Before τmin,\r
no quenching is applied, and we take this time as the\r
second parameter of our Bayesian inference.\r
Finally, fluid velocity fields also evolve during the pre\u0002equilibrium phase, as initial spatial anisotropies begin to\r
generate flow [65]. This non-equilibrium evolution is well\r
approximated by the universal pre-flow extracted from\r
EKT [80]. We incorporate it by scaling the transverse\r
velocity linearly with time:\r
veff,T (τ, ⃗x) = τ\r
τhyd\r
vT (τhyd, ⃗x),\r
veff,z(τ ) = tanh ηs ,\r
(4)\r
where the longitudinal velocity scales with the space-time\r
rapidity ηs.\r

medium effects in fragmentation, and thus ignores, for\r
example, the impact of the angular redistribution of par\u0002ticles due to broadening.\r
Our work resembles previous studies of RAA and\r
v2 [66, 67, 82–96]. In contrast to these works, we fo\u0002cus on jets instead of hadrons, since jets are infrared\u0002and collinear-safe, and have small non-perturbative cor\u0002rections in vacuum [97–100]. We use state-of-the-art hy\u0002drodynamics and energy-loss formulas, including elastic\r
energy loss as well as the effects of medium response. To\r
our knowledge, this is the first model implementation of\r
jet energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase carried out\r
in a physically well-motivated manner.\r
We employ Bayesian inference, implemented via the\r
JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103], to constrain the jet\u0002medium strong coupling gmed and the initial quench\u0002ing time in the pre-equilibrium phase τmin. We used\r
flat priors in the intervals 1.2 ≤ gmed ≤ 1.7, and\r
0.01 ≤ τmin [fm] ≤ 0.4. Our data points include R\r

centrality. The inference incorporates statistical and sys\u0002tematic uncertainties of the data, and we estimate the\r
full correlation matrix by employing a finite correlation\r
length of 0.2 [102, 107]. Luminosity and centrality uncer\u0002tainties are added to the systematics. We neglect inher\u0002ent model uncertainties in the inference such as scale and\r
nPDF uncertainties, and we will present them separately

Figure 5 in App. A provides predictions for jets at\r
RHIC energies [108] and charged hadrons at LHC en\u0002ergies [109–112] using the extracted parameters. Even\r
though our framework was designed for jets, it also pro\u0002vides a good description of the charged hadron RAA with\u0002out including them in the inference. We also see, how\u0002ever, that our framework underestimates hadron elliptic\r
flow at low pT . This failure is consistent with previous\r
findings using pQCD energy loss [66, 67]. It has been\r
pointed out that a rather late quenching time of around\r
∼ 1 fm would resolve the disagreement [67]. Alterna\u0002tively, the absence of this issue for jets signals the need\r
for model improvements which could be more relevant\r
for (mid-pT ) hadrons than for jets. Again, for complete\u0002ness, we show predictions with the previous two limiting\r
scenarios (early pre-eq. and no pre-eq. energy loss), re\u0002sulting as before in subtle differences.\r
OO predictions: The recent OO run at the LHC has\r
attracted considerable attention, with numerous dedi\u0002cated studies on, for example, baseline analyses [113–\r
116] and hadron quenching predictions [117–125]. Com\u0002pared to these studies, our framework incorporates ad\u0002ditional improvements, with an emphasis on jet observ\u0002ables. For our OO predictions of RAA and v2 we have set\r
√\r
sNN = 5.36 TeV and |η| < 2.1. We defer to future work\r
the computation of higher-order flow harmonics, along\r
with the corresponding predictions for NeNe collisions.\r
Figure 2 shows our jet and charged hadron predictions\r
for OO collisions. The left panel shows the inclusive jet\r

is indicated with gray bands. The dark band represents\r
NLO scale uncertainties, while the light band is the 68%\r

because of the relatively high momentum cutoff we chose\r

not affect the central value. Quenching effects are shown\r

sion, which presents a similar pattern to jets.\r
Figure 3 shows the inclusive jet and charged hadron\r
elliptic flow. There is relatively smaller sensitivity to\r
the nPDF, as v2 is an observable that is differential in\r
the transverse plane, using solely the medium spectra,\r
so the impact of the nPDF largely cancels in Eq. (5).\r
Semi-inclusive observables can present analogous advan\u0002tages [115]. We observe that, in contrast to large collision\r
systems, the elliptic flow coefficient v2 increases with cen\u0002trality. This is a consequence of the more prominent role\r
played by the fluctuations of the initial nuclear shape in\r
small collision systems [117, 119, 126]. Jet distributions\r
are not shown for very low pT , where our framework is\r
not expected to apply.\r
Due to the relatively small path lengths involved in\r
OO, the typical value of the coherence angle is relatively\r
large, θc ∼ 0.5, and so R = 0.4 jets are unresolved and\r
lose energy as single color charges. Therefore, hadron\r
and jet suppression in our framework can be understood\r
by the mere pT shift resulting from hadronization. In\r
contrast, in larger systems (with smaller values of θc)\r
both RAA and v2 receive additional contributions due to\r
resolved jet substructure fluctuations [44, 127].\r
Finally, Fig. 6 in App. B shows our OO predictions\r
for minimum bias with the different limiting cases intro\u0002duced previously. Only subtle differences are observed\r
for earlier vs. later quenching for the ranges of τmin ex\u0002plored.\r
IV. CONCLUSIONS\r
In this work, we have integrated our semi-analytical jet\r
quenching model with a state-of-the-art description of\r
heavy-ion collisions, IP-Glasma+JIMWLK+MUSIC+UrQMD.\r
We incorporated energy loss in the pre-equilibrium phase\r
via the hydrodynamic attractor for the first time. Our\r
framework provides a simultaneous description of jet\r
RAA and v2 in agreement with data in AA collisions, of\u0002fering a strong validation of the approach. We show that\r
a joint description of these observables places constraints\r
on the onset time of jet-medium interactions, which is\r
around 0.2 fm, deep in the pre-equilibrium phase. Then,\r
we applied these parameters to predict jet and hadron\r
quenching in other collision systems. We saw that our\r
framework successfully predicts hadron suppression but\r
underestimates hadron elliptic flow towards lower pT .\r
Previous studies have reported similar results, suggesting\r
that a delayed onset of quenching of about 1 fm could ac\u0002count for the hadron experimental data. Our success in\r
describing jets, however, would rather suggest the need to\r
account for additional medium effects whose importance\r
could grow at lower pT .\r
Our constrained framework has been used to make\r
realistic predictions for the intermediate-sized OO col\u0002lisions. We obtained sizable energy loss both for jets and\r
charged hadrons, in quantitative agreement with the pre\u0002liminary results from CMS [128]. Even though we have\r
shown that pre-equilibrium effects play a moderate role\r
in our model, we anticipate that including forthcoming\r
data on high-pT flow coefficients will result in further\r
constraints. Furthermore, in this work we have provided\r
predictions for elliptic anisotropies and different central\u0002ity selections, both for hadrons and jets. Due to the\r
small path lengths in OO, unlike in PbPb or AuAu, jet\r
constituents are barely resolved (jets are fully coherent),\r
and thus we obtain similar energy loss for hadrons and\r
jets (modulo a pT shift in fragmentation). This outcome\r
constitutes a prediction of our framework which can be\r
confronted with future experimental results on jet sup\u0002pression in light ions.\r
As an outlook, our jet quenching framework could ben\u0002efit from an improved description of medium-induced\r
emissions, elastic scatterings, and medium response in\r
several ways. It is important to note that, at very\r
early times, local color fields are saturated and highly\r
anisotropic, a scenario which our energy-loss framework,\r
built on local equilibrium, cannot accommodate. For\r
these initial stages, it would be desirable to incorpo\u0002rate recent developments in energy-loss calculations for\r
anisotropic media [129–134], correlated color fields [135],\r
and out of-equilibrium plasma [136, 137], so as to extend\r
quenching for those earliest times where the attractor so\u0002lution is not meant to apply."""

AA(pT , η, R) are computed using the mi\u0002crojet evolution as employed in [42, 44], with initial con\u0002ditions from LO Pythia at R0 = 1. Our framework is\r
built on the JETSCAPE/STAT toolkit [101–103]. We eval\u0002uated our model for 24 design points, equally distributed\r
in the parameter space. To focus on primary model fea\u0002tures that are robust against statistical uncertainty, we\r
reduced our data to its 10 principal components, and\r
trained a Gaussian Process Emulator to interpolate be\u0002tween the predictions. The resulting parameter posterior\r
is shown in the main text in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we pro\u0002vide two alternative inferences for gmed: one with fixed\r
τmin = 0.08 fm, (and extracted ⟨gmed⟩ = 1.385) referred\r
to as “early preeq”, and another with τmin = 0.4 fm, (ex\u0002tracted ⟨gmed⟩ = 1.473), referred to as “no preeq”.\r
Figure 4 shows the corresponding posterior predictive\r
distributions. These jet data were used to constrain the\r
model parameters. Different rows correspond to differ\u0002ent measurements. We observe good agreement with all\r
data for both R\r
jet\r
AA and v\r
jet\r
2\r
, including all collision ener\u0002gies, centralities, rapidities, jet cone sizes, and momenta.\r
There is a slight tension in v\r
jet\r
2\r
for the lowest pT bins.\r
This tension could be do to missing ingredients in the\r
description of energy loss towards lower pT . Dotted and\r
dashed lines show the two alternative fits, where τmin is\r
kept fixed. There are subtle differences between different\r
fits, with the fixed earlier quenching reducing the jet v2,\r
as expected.\r
Finally, we also compare our results to jets at RHIC\r
energies and charged hadron observables, shown in\r
Fig. 5. As our framework was designed for jets, we did\r
not include these data in the inference. We see an overall\r
good agreement with both RHIC energies and charged\r
hadron RAA. Interestingly, hadron RAA seems to favor\r
early quenching, as indicated by the dashed lines. There\r
is a clear underestimation of the hadron elliptic flow at\r
low momenta, consistent with previous findings from\r
other theory collaborations, likely linked to the (milder)\r
tension with low pT jets mentioned above.\r
Appendix B: OO predictions without\r
pre-equilibrium quenching\r
Figure 6 shows the nuclear modification and elliptic\r
flow for minimum bias OO collisions. Curves represent\r
the limiting scenarios tested in App. A regarding pre\u0002equilibrium quenching: “early preeq” denotes τmin = 0.08\r
fm, “no preeq” τmin = 0.4 fm, with their corresponding\r
inferred gmed. The best fit denotes our default setting\r
shown in Fig. 1. For simplicity, we don’t show nPDF\r
uncertainties. Slight differences are present in the differ\u0002ent limiting scenarios. Interestingly, an earlier quenching\r
can result in a relatively larger v2, in contrast to larger\r
systems, likely reflecting the more important role of fluc\u0002tuations over average geometry in smaller systems.\r
