On the homology theory of fiber spaces\r
T.V. Kadeishvili\r
This paper was published (in Russian) in Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 35:3\r
(1980), 183-188. The English translation was published in Russian\r
Math. Surveys, 35:3 (1980), 231-238.\r
In this paper the homology theory of fibre spaces is studied by introducing\r
additional algebraic structure in homology and cohomology.\r
All modules are assumed to be over an arbitrary associative ring Λ with\r
unit; by a differential algebra, coalgebra, module, or comodule we mean these\r
objects graded by non-negative integers; ˆa denotes (−1)dega.\r
The category A(∞). An A(∞)-algebra in the sense of Stasheff [1] is defined\r
to be a graded Λ-module M, endowed with a set of operations {mi: ⊗iM →\r
M, i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying the conditions mi((⊗iM)q) ⊂ Mq+i−2 and\r
X\r

i−k\r
j=1\r
(−1)kmi−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗...⊗aˆk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗...⊗ak+j )⊗ak+j+1 ⊗...⊗ai) = 0\r
for any ai ∈ M and i ≥ 1. A morphism of A(∞)-algebras (M, {mi}) →\r
(M′, {m′\r
i\r
}) is a set of homomorphisms {fi: ⊗iM → M′, i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying\r
the conditions fi((⊗iM)q) ⊂ M′\r
q+i−1\r
and\r
Pi−1\r
k=0\r
Pi−k\r
j=1(−1)kfi−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ ai) =\r
Pi\r
t=1\r
P\r
S(t,i) m′\r
t\r
(fk1(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1) ⊗ ... ⊗ fkt(ai−kt+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai))\r
where S(t, i) = {k1, ..., kt ∈ N, Pkp = i}. The A(∞)-algebras together with\r
these morphisms form a category, which we denote by A(∞).\r
The specification on M of an A(∞)-algebra structure (M, {mi}) is equivalent\r
to the specification on the tensor coalgebra T\r
c\r
(M) = Λ +M +M ⊗M +... with\r
the grading dim(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Pdimai + n and comultiplication\r
∆(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Xn\r
i=0\r
(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai) ⊗ (ai+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an)\r

of a differential dm : T\r
c\r
(M) → T\r
c\r
(M) that turns T\r
c\r
(M) into a differential\r
coalgebra; this set {mi} determines the differential dm by\r
dm(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) =\r
nX−1\r
k=0\r
nX−k\r
j=1\r
(−1)kaˆ1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ an,\r
and the differential coalgebra (T\r
c\r
(M), dm) is called the B˜-construction of the\r
A(∞)-algera (M, {mi}) (Stasheff [1]) and is denoted by B˜(M, {mi}). The speci\u0002fication of an A(∞)-algebra morphism {fi} : (M, {mi}) → (M′\r
, {m′\r
i\r
}) is equiva\u0002lent to that of a differential coalgebra mapping f : B˜(M, {mi}) → B˜(M′\r
, {m′\r
i\r
});\r
the morphism {fi} determines the mapping f by\r
f(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Xn\r
t=1\r
X\r
S(t,n)\r
fk1(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1) ⊗ ... ⊗ fkt(an−kt+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai).\r
Thus the category A(∞) can be identified with a full subcategory of the category\r
of differential coalgebras.\r
An arbitrary object in A(∞) of the form (M, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...}) is identified\r
with the differential algebra (M, ∂, ·) where ∂ = m1 and a1 · a2 = −m2(˜a1 ⊗a2).\r
For such an object the B˜-construction coincides with the usual B-construction,\r
any morphism of such objects of the form {f1, 0, 0, ...} is identified with the\r
differential algebra mapping f1 : (M, ∂, ·) → (M, ∂, ·). Thus the category of\r
differential algebras is a subcategory of A(∞), while the category DASH (see\r
[2]) is the full subcategory of A(∞) generated by differential algebras, and the\r
functor B˜ is an extension of B from this subcategory to A(∞).\r
Theorem 1 For any differential algebra C with free Hi(C), i ≥ 0 it is possible\r
to introduce on H(C) an A(∞)-algebra structure\r
(H(C), {Xi}), Xi: ⊗\r
iH(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...\r
such that X1 = 0, X2(a1 ⊗ a2) = −a˜1 · a2 and there exists an A(∞)-morphism\r
{fi} : (H(C), {Xi}) → (C, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...})\r
for which f1 : H(C) → C induces an identical isomorphis in homology.\r
Proof. We need to construct two sets of homomorphisms\r
{Xi: ⊗\r
iH(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...}, {fi\r
: ⊗\r
iH(C) → C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...},\r
satisfying the conditions in the definition of the category A(∞):\r
X\r
i−1\r
k=0\r
X\r
i−k\r
j=1\r
(−1)kXi−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗...⊗aˆk ⊗Xj (ak+1 ⊗...⊗ak+j )⊗ak+j+1 ⊗...⊗ai) = 0,\r

k=0\r
Pi−k\r
j=1(−1)kfi−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ Xj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ ai) =\r
m1fi(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai)+\r
Pi−1\r
s=1 m2(fs(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ as) ⊗ fi−s(as+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai))\r
(2)\r
for arbitrary ak ∈ H(C) and i ≥ 1. Fir i = 1 we take X1 = 0, and, using\r
the fact that Hi(C) is free, we define f1 : H(C) → C to be a cycle-choosing\r
homomorphis; the conditions (1) and (2), as well as the initial condition on f1\r
are thereby satisfied. Suppose now that Xi and fi have been constructed for\r
i < n in such a way that the conditions (1) and (2) hold. Let\r
Un(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Pn−1\r
s=1 m2(fs(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ as) ⊗ fn−s(as+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an))+\r
Pn−2\r
k=0\r
Pn−1\r
j=2 (−1)k+1fn−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ Xj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ an)\r
(here the Xi and fi already defined are involved). Then the condition (2) takes\r
the form\r
m1fn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = (f1Xn − Un)(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an). (3)\r
Direct calculations show that ∂Un = 0, that is, Un(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) is a cycle in\r
C for arbitrary ai ∈ H(C), and we define Xn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) to be the class of\r
this cycle, that is, Xn = {Un}. Since f1 is a cycle-choosing homomorphism,\r
the difference f1Xn − Un is homological to zero. Assuming that ai ∈ H(C) are\r
free generators we define fn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) as an element of C boundaring this\r
difference and extend by linearity. For the Xn and fn thus defined the condition\r
(3) is automatically satisfied. The remanning condition (1) can be proved by a\r
straightforward check.\r
We remark that the theorem is true also when an arbitrary A(∞)-algebra\r
is taken instead of C, and H(M) is understood to be the homology of M with\r
respect to the differential m1.\r
The A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi}) we call the homology A(∞)-algebra of the\r
differential algebra C. As is clear from the proof, this structure is not uniquely\r
determined on H(C) (there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the fi). We show\r
later that the structure of the homology A(∞)-algebra on H(C) is unique up\r
to isomorphism in A(∞).\r
We mention that if a1 · a2 = a2 · a3 = 0 for a1, a2, a3 ∈ H(C), then X3(a1 ⊗\r
a2 ⊗ a3) is an element of the Massey product < a1, a2, a3 >, and this fact\r
provides us with examples in which the operation X3 is non-trivial. The next\r
result follows from the Theorem 1.\r
Corollary 1 The mapping of differential coalgebras\r
f : B˜(H(C), {Xi}) → B(C)\r
induces an isomorphism in homology.\r
The category M(∞). An A(∞)-module over an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi})\r
we define to be a graded Λ-module P, endowed with a set of operations {pi:\r
3

(⊗i−1M) ⊗ P → P, i = 1, 2, 3, ...} satisfying the conditions pi(((⊗i−1M) ⊗\r
P)q) ⊂ Mq+i−2 and\r

j=1 (−1)kpi−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ...⊗\r
ai−1 ⊗ b) + Pi−1\r
k=0(−1)kpk+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ pi−k(ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b)) = 0.\r
The specification on P of an A(∞)-module structure over (M, {mi}) is equiv\u0002alent to the specification on B˜(M, {mi}) ⊗ P of a differential that turns it into\r
a differential comodule over B˜(M, {mi}). The objects of the category M(∞)\r
are defined to be the pairs ((M, {mi}),(P, {pi})), where (M, {mi}) is an A(∞)-\r
algebra, and (P, {pi}) is an A(∞)-module over it. A morphism is defined to be a\r
pair of sets of homomorphisms {fi}, {gi} where {fi} : (M, {mi}) → (M′, {m′\r
i\r
})\r
is a morphism of A(∞)-algebras and\r
{gi: (⊗\r
i−1M) ⊗ P → P′\r
, i = 1, 2, 3, ...}\r
is a set satisfying the conditions gi(((⊗i−1M) ⊗ P)q) ⊂ P\r

fkt−1(ak1+...+kt−2+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1+...+kt−1) ⊗ gkt(ai−kt+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b));\r
These conditions ensure that the mapping\r
g : B˜(M, {mi}) ⊗ P → B˜(M′, {m′\r
i}) ⊗ P\r
′\r
given by\r
g(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b) = Pi\r

fkt−1(ak1+...+kt−2+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1+...+kt−1) ⊗ gkt(ak1+...+kt−1+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai−1 ⊗ b)\r
is a differential comodule mapping compatible with f. With the obvious mor\u0002phisms the category of pairs (C, D), where C is a differential algebra and D is\r
a differential module over it, forms a subcategory of M(∞).\r
Theorem 2 If C is a differential algebra and D is a differential module over\r
it such that Hi(C) and Hi(D) are free, then on H(D) it is possible to in\u0002troduce the structure of an A(∞)-module (H(D), {Yi}), Yi\r
: (⊗i−1H(C)) ⊗\r
H(D) → H(D), p = 1, 2, 3, ... over the homology A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi})\r
such that Y1 = 0, Y2(a ⊗ b) = −a˜ · b and there exists a morphism ({fi}, {gi}) :\r
((H(C), {Xi}),(H(D), {Yi})) → (C, D) of M(∞) for which f1 : H(C) → C and\r
g1 : H(D) → D induce identical isomorphisms in homology.\r
Proof. The sets {gi} and {Yi} are constructed by induction on i just as in the\r
proof of Theorem 1. Using the fact that Hi(D) is free, we define g1 to be a\r
4

cycle-choosing homomorphism, while Y1 = 0, and the conditions of the category\r
M(∞) are satisfied for i = 1. Let\r
Vn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)) =\r
Pn−1\r
s=1 p2(fs(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ as) ⊗ gn−s(as+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b))+\r
Pn−3\r

k=1 (−1)k\r
gk+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ Yn−k(ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)),\r
then ∂Vn = 0, therefore, we define Yn = {Vn}. Since g1 is a cycle-choosing\r
homomorphism, g1Yn−Vn is a cycle in D homologous to zero. Using the fact that\r
Hi(D) is free, we define gn : (⊗n−1) ⊗ H(D) → H(D) to be a homomorphism\r
for which ∂gn = g1Vn − Vn. The conditions of the category M(∞) are satisfied\r
for the Yn and gn thus defined.\r
Twisted tensor products. The twisted tensor products of Brown [3] can\r
be generalized from the case of differential algebras and modules to the case\r
of A(∞)-algebras and A(∞)-modules: for an arbitrary differential coalgebra\r
(K, d) and an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi}) a ∼-twisting cochain we define to be a\r
homomorphism φ : K → M of degree −1 that satisfies the condition\r
φd =\r
X∞\r
i=1\r
mi(φ ⊗ φ ⊗ ... ⊗ φ)∆i,\r
where ∆i: K → K ⊗ K is the homomorphism defined by ∆1 = idK, ∆2 =\r
∆ : K → K ⊗ K, ∆i = (idK ⊗ ∆i−1)∆. The specification of a ∼-twisting\r
cochain φ : K → M is equivalent to that of a mapping of differential coalgebra\r
fφ : (K, d) → B˜(M, {mi}). For any (K, d) and ((M, {mi}),(P, {pi})) ∈ M(∞)\r
any ∼-twisting cochain φ : K → M on the tensor product K ⊗ P determines by\r
∂φ = d ⊗ idP +\r
X∞\r
i=1\r
(\r
ˆid ⊗ pi)(idK ⊗ φ ⊗ ... ⊗ φ ⊗ idP )(∆i ⊗ idP )\r
a differential, turning (K ⊗ P, ∂φ) into a differential comodule over (K, d); this\r
differential comodule is called the ∼-twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P. If M is an\r
A(∞)-algebra of the form (M, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...}), and P is an A(∞)-module of\r
the form (P, {p1, p2, 0, 0, ...}), then φ is the usual twisting cochain, and K ⊗φ P\r
coincides with the usual twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P.\r
We need the concept of equivalence of twisting cochains (see [4], [5], [6]). We\r
say that φ, ψ : K → C are equivalent if there is a homomorphism c : K → C of\r
degree 0 for which c0 = c|C0 = 0 and ψ = (1 + c) ⋆ φ where\r
(1 + c) ⋆ φ = (1 + ˆc) · φ · (1 + c)\r
−1 − (cd + ∂c) · (1 + c)−1\r
;\r
φ ∼ ψ if and only if fφ, fψ : K → B are homotopic in the sense of [2] (coderiva\u0002tion homotopy): fφ − fψ = ∂D + D∂ with (D ⊗ fψ + ˆfφ ⊗ D)∆ = ∆D.\r
Theorem 3 If (K, d) is a differential coalgebra with free Ki, and φ : K → C is\r
an arbitrary twisting cochain, then there exists a ∼-twisting cochain φ\r
∗\r
: K →\r
H(C) such that φ and f\r
∗φ∗ =\r
P∞\r
i=1 fi(φ ∗ ⊗... ⊗ φ∗)∆i are equivalent.\r
5

Proof. To construct φ∗ we prove the following inductive assertion: for any\r
i > 0 there exists a twisting cochain φ\r
(i)\r
: K → C and a homomorphisms\r
φ\r
∗\r
i\r
: Ki → Hi−1(C) and ci: Ki → Ci such that\r
(a) φ\r
∗\r
i\r
d =\r

(b) φ\r
(i) = (1 + ci) ⋆ φ(i−1);\r
(c) φ\r

t=1\r
P\r
S(t,i)\r
ft(φ\r
∗\r
k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ\r
∗\r
kt\r
)∆t.\r
For i = 1 we take φ\r
∗\r
1 = {φ1}. Since the difference (φ1 − f1φ\r
∗\r
1\r
)(k) is ho\u0002mologous to zero for each k ∈ K1 and K1 is free, we obtain a homomorphism\r
c1 : K1 → C1 for which −∂c1 = φ1 − f1φ\r
∗\r
1\r
. We define φ\r
(1) = (1 + c1) ⋆ φ, so\r
φ\r
(1)\r
1 = φ1 + ∂c1 = f1φ\r
∗\r
1\r
. Suppose now that φ\r
(i)\r
, φ∗\r
i\r
, and ci have already been\r
constructed in such a way that (a), (b), and (c) hold for i < n. Let\r
Wn = φ\r
(n−1)\r
n −\r

t=2\r
X\r
S(t,n)\r
ft(φ\r
∗\r
k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ\r
∗\r
kt\r
)∆t;\r
A direct check shows that ∂Wn = 0; we define φ\r
∗\r
n = {Wn}. Since the difference\r
Wn − f1φ\r
∗\r
n\r
is homological to zero and Kn is free, we can construct a cn : Kn →\r
Cn such that −∂cn = Wn − f1φ\r
∗\r
n; let φ\r
(n) = (1 + cn) ⋆ φ(n−1). Then\r
φ\r
(n)\r
n = φ\r
(n−1)\r
n + ∂cn = f1φ\r
∗\r
n − Wn =\r

t=1\r
X\r
S(t,n)\r
ft(φ\r
∗\r
k1 ⊗ ... ⊗ φ\r
∗\r
kt\r
)∆t,\r
consequently, (b) and (c) hold for φ\r
(n)\r
, φ∗\r
n\r
, and cn, and the validity of (a) can be\r
checked directly. From (a) we see that φ\r
∗ =\r
P\r
i\r
φ\r
∗\r
i\r
is a ∼-twisting cochain, and\r
from (b) and (c) we deduce that f\r
∗φ∗ = φ∞, where φ∞ = Πi(1 + ci) ⋆ φ ∼ φ.\r
It follows from Theorem 3 that for any differential coalgebra mapping g :\r
K → B there exists a G∗: K → B˜(H(C), {Xi}) for which g and fg∗ are\r
homotopic in the sense of [2]. This assertion implies uniqueness mentioned above\r
for the structure of homology A(∞)-algebra: if (H(C), {Xi}) and (H(C), {Xi})\r
are two structures of homology A(∞)-algebra on H(C), then by taking K =\r
B˜(H(C), {Xi}) and g = f : B˜(H(C), {Xi}) → B(C), we obtain a\r
g\r
∗\r
: B˜(H(C), {Xi}) → B˜(H(C), {Xi})\r
for which fg∗ ∼ g. Then the first component of the A(∞)algebra morphism\r
{g\r
∗\r
i\r
} : (H(C), {Xi}) → (H(C), {Xi}) induced by g\r
∗\r
is g\r
∗\r
1 = idH(C)\r
, and this\r
implies that {g\r
∗\r
i\r
} is an isomorphism in A(∞).\r
The next result follows from Theorems 1, 2 and 3.\r
Corollary 2 K ⊗φ D and K ⊗φ∗ H(D) have isomorphic homology under the\r
conditions of Theorems 1, 2 and 3.\r
The results obtained have the following applications.\r
The first proposition is obtained from Corollary 1 by taking C = C¯\r
∗(G),\r
where G is a connected topological group such that the Hi(G) are free, bearing\r
in mind that H(B(C)) = H∗(BG).\r
6

Proposition 1 The homology of the B˜-construction B˜(H¯\r
∗(G), {Xi}) are iso\u0002morphic to that of classifying space BG.\r
The next proposition is obtained from Corollary 1 by taking C = C\r
∗\r
(B, b0),\r
where B is a simply connected space with free groups Hi(B, b0), and bearing in\r
mind that H(B(C)) = H∗(ΩC).\r
Proposition 2 The homology of the B˜-construction B˜(H¯ ∗(B, b0), {Xi}) are\r
isomorphic to the cohomology of the loop space ΩB.\r
Let ξ = (X, p, B, G) be a principal G-fibration with paracompact base and\r
connected G, let F be a G-space, and ξ[F] = (E, p, B, F, G) the associated fiber\r
bundle, with the Hi(G) and H(i(F) free. The final proposition is obtained from\r
Corollary 2 ty taking C = C∗(G), D = C∗(F), and φ a twisting cochain of the\r
fibration ξ ([3]).\r
Proposition 3 The homology of the ∼-twisted tensor product C∗(B)⊗φ∗ H∗(F)\r
is isomorphic to that of E.\r
This proposition generalize a result of Shih [7]: if G is (n − 1)-connected,\r
then the components φ\r
∗\r
i ∈ C\r
i\r
(B, Hi−1(G)) vanish for 0 < i < n + 1, therefore,\r
the differentials d\r
i of the spectral sequence of ξ[F] are trivial for 1 < i < n + 1,\r
and the components are cocycles for n < i < 2n + 1, consequently, d\r
j\r
can be\r
expressed for n < i < 2n + 1 in terms of certain characteristic classes of ξ and\r
the operation Y2 : H∗(G) ⊗ H∗(F) → H∗(F); we remark that higher operations\r
Yi are needed for computing d\r
j\r
, j > 2n, in terms of φ\r
∗\r
.\r
Theorems 1, 2 and Proposition 3 were announced in [8] and Proposition 2\r
in [9].\r

In this paper the homology theory of fibre spaces is studied by introducing\r
additional algebraic structure in homology and cohomology.\r
All modules are assumed to be over an arbitrary associative ring Λ with\r
unit; by a differential algebra, coalgebra, module, or comodule we mean these\r
objects graded by non-negative integers; ˆa denotes (−1)dega.\r
The category A(∞). An A(∞)-algebra in the sense of Stasheff [1] is defined\r
to be a graded Λ-module M, endowed with a set of operations {mi: ⊗iM →\r
M, i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying the conditions mi((⊗iM)q) ⊂ Mq+i−2 and\r

for any ai ∈ M and i ≥ 1. A morphism of A(∞)-algebras (M, {mi}) →\r
(M′, {m′\r
i\r
}) is a set of homomorphisms {fi: ⊗iM → M′, i = 1, 2, ...} satisfying\r
the conditions fi((⊗iM)q) ⊂ M′\r

t\r
(fk1(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1) ⊗ ... ⊗ fkt(ai−kt+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai))\r
where S(t, i) = {k1, ..., kt ∈ N, Pkp = i}. The A(∞)-algebras together with\r
these morphisms form a category, which we denote by A(∞).\r
The specification on M of an A(∞)-algebra structure (M, {mi}) is equivalent\r
to the specification on the tensor coalgebra T\r
c\r
(M) = Λ +M +M ⊗M +... with\r
the grading dim(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Pdimai + n and comultiplication\r
∆(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Xn\r

of a differential dm : T\r
c\r
(M) → T\r
c\r
(M) that turns T\r
c\r
(M) into a differential\r
coalgebra; this set {mi} determines the differential dm by\r
dm(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) =\r
nX−1\r
k=0\r
nX−k\r
j=1\r
(−1)kaˆ1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ mj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ an,\r
and the differential coalgebra (T\r
c\r
(M), dm) is called the B˜-construction of the\r
A(∞)-algera (M, {mi}) (Stasheff [1]) and is denoted by B˜(M, {mi}). The speci\u0002fication of an A(∞)-algebra morphism {fi} : (M, {mi}) → (M′\r
, {m′\r
i\r
}) is equiva\u0002lent to that of a differential coalgebra mapping f : B˜(M, {mi}) → B˜(M′\r
, {m′\r
i\r
});\r
the morphism {fi} determines the mapping f by\r
f(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Xn\r
t=1\r
X\r
S(t,n)\r
fk1(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak1) ⊗ ... ⊗ fkt(an−kt+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ai).\r
Thus the category A(∞) can be identified with a full subcategory of the category\r
of differential coalgebras.\r
An arbitrary object in A(∞) of the form (M, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...}) is identified\r
with the differential algebra (M, ∂, ·) where ∂ = m1 and a1 · a2 = −m2(˜a1 ⊗a2).\r
For such an object the B˜-construction coincides with the usual B-construction,\r
any morphism of such objects of the form {f1, 0, 0, ...} is identified with the\r
differential algebra mapping f1 : (M, ∂, ·) → (M, ∂, ·). Thus the category of\r
differential algebras is a subcategory of A(∞), while the category DASH (see\r
[2]) is the full subcategory of A(∞) generated by differential algebras, and the\r
functor B˜ is an extension of B from this subcategory to A(∞).\r
Theorem 1 For any differential algebra C with free Hi(C), i ≥ 0 it is possible\r
to introduce on H(C) an A(∞)-algebra structure\r
(H(C), {Xi}), Xi: ⊗\r
iH(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...\r
such that X1 = 0, X2(a1 ⊗ a2) = −a˜1 · a2 and there exists an A(∞)-morphism\r
{fi} : (H(C), {Xi}) → (C, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...})\r
for which f1 : H(C) → C induces an identical isomorphis in homology.\r
Proof. We need to construct two sets of homomorphisms\r
{Xi: ⊗\r
iH(C) → H(C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...}, {fi\r
: ⊗\r
iH(C) → C), i = 1, 2, 3, ...},\r

for arbitrary ak ∈ H(C) and i ≥ 1. Fir i = 1 we take X1 = 0, and, using\r
the fact that Hi(C) is free, we define f1 : H(C) → C to be a cycle-choosing\r
homomorphis; the conditions (1) and (2), as well as the initial condition on f1\r
are thereby satisfied. Suppose now that Xi and fi have been constructed for\r
i < n in such a way that the conditions (1) and (2) hold. Let\r
Un(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = Pn−1\r

j=2 (−1)k+1fn−j+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ Xj (ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ ak+j ) ⊗ ... ⊗ an)\r
(here the Xi and fi already defined are involved). Then the condition (2) takes\r
the form\r
m1fn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) = (f1Xn − Un)(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an). (3)\r
Direct calculations show that ∂Un = 0, that is, Un(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) is a cycle in\r
C for arbitrary ai ∈ H(C), and we define Xn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) to be the class of\r
this cycle, that is, Xn = {Un}. Since f1 is a cycle-choosing homomorphism,\r
the difference f1Xn − Un is homological to zero. Assuming that ai ∈ H(C) are\r
free generators we define fn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an) as an element of C boundaring this\r
difference and extend by linearity. For the Xn and fn thus defined the condition\r
(3) is automatically satisfied. The remanning condition (1) can be proved by a\r
straightforward check.\r
We remark that the theorem is true also when an arbitrary A(∞)-algebra\r
is taken instead of C, and H(M) is understood to be the homology of M with\r
respect to the differential m1.\r
The A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi}) we call the homology A(∞)-algebra of the\r
differential algebra C. As is clear from the proof, this structure is not uniquely\r
determined on H(C) (there is an arbitrariness in the choice of the fi). We show\r
later that the structure of the homology A(∞)-algebra on H(C) is unique up\r
to isomorphism in A(∞).\r
We mention that if a1 · a2 = a2 · a3 = 0 for a1, a2, a3 ∈ H(C), then X3(a1 ⊗\r
a2 ⊗ a3) is an element of the Massey product < a1, a2, a3 >, and this fact\r
provides us with examples in which the operation X3 is non-trivial. The next\r
result follows from the Theorem 1.\r
Corollary 1 The mapping of differential coalgebras\r
f : B˜(H(C), {Xi}) → B(C)\r
induces an isomorphism in homology.\r
The category M(∞). An A(∞)-module over an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi})\r
we define to be a graded Λ-module P, endowed with a set of operations {pi:\r

(⊗i−1M) ⊗ P → P, i = 1, 2, 3, ...} satisfying the conditions pi(((⊗i−1M) ⊗\r

The specification on P of an A(∞)-module structure over (M, {mi}) is equiv\u0002alent to the specification on B˜(M, {mi}) ⊗ P of a differential that turns it into\r
a differential comodule over B˜(M, {mi}). The objects of the category M(∞)\r
are defined to be the pairs ((M, {mi}),(P, {pi})), where (M, {mi}) is an A(∞)-\r
algebra, and (P, {pi}) is an A(∞)-module over it. A morphism is defined to be a\r
pair of sets of homomorphisms {fi}, {gi} where {fi} : (M, {mi}) → (M′, {m′\r

is a morphism of A(∞)-algebras and\r

is a differential comodule mapping compatible with f. With the obvious mor\u0002phisms the category of pairs (C, D), where C is a differential algebra and D is\r
a differential module over it, forms a subcategory of M(∞).\r
Theorem 2 If C is a differential algebra and D is a differential module over\r
it such that Hi(C) and Hi(D) are free, then on H(D) it is possible to in\u0002troduce the structure of an A(∞)-module (H(D), {Yi}), Yi\r
: (⊗i−1H(C)) ⊗\r
H(D) → H(D), p = 1, 2, 3, ... over the homology A(∞)-algebra (H(C), {Xi})\r
such that Y1 = 0, Y2(a ⊗ b) = −a˜ · b and there exists a morphism ({fi}, {gi}) :\r
((H(C), {Xi}),(H(D), {Yi})) → (C, D) of M(∞) for which f1 : H(C) → C and\r
g1 : H(D) → D induce identical isomorphisms in homology.\r
Proof. The sets {gi} and {Yi} are constructed by induction on i just as in the\r
proof of Theorem 1. Using the fact that Hi(D) is free, we define g1 to be a\r

cycle-choosing homomorphism, while Y1 = 0, and the conditions of the category\r
M(∞) are satisfied for i = 1. Let\r
Vn(a1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)) =\r

k=1 (−1)k\r
gk+1(ˆa1 ⊗ ... ⊗ aˆk ⊗ Yn−k(ak+1 ⊗ ... ⊗ an−1 ⊗ b)),\r
then ∂Vn = 0, therefore, we define Yn = {Vn}. Since g1 is a cycle-choosing\r
homomorphism, g1Yn−Vn is a cycle in D homologous to zero. Using the fact that\r
Hi(D) is free, we define gn : (⊗n−1) ⊗ H(D) → H(D) to be a homomorphism\r
for which ∂gn = g1Vn − Vn. The conditions of the category M(∞) are satisfied\r
for the Yn and gn thus defined.\r
Twisted tensor products. The twisted tensor products of Brown [3] can\r
be generalized from the case of differential algebras and modules to the case\r
of A(∞)-algebras and A(∞)-modules: for an arbitrary differential coalgebra\r
(K, d) and an A(∞)-algebra (M, {mi}) a ∼-twisting cochain we define to be a\r
homomorphism φ : K → M of degree −1 that satisfies the condition\r
φd =\r
X∞\r
i=1\r
mi(φ ⊗ φ ⊗ ... ⊗ φ)∆i,\r
where ∆i: K → K ⊗ K is the homomorphism defined by ∆1 = idK, ∆2 =\r
∆ : K → K ⊗ K, ∆i = (idK ⊗ ∆i−1)∆. The specification of a ∼-twisting\r
cochain φ : K → M is equivalent to that of a mapping of differential coalgebra\r
fφ : (K, d) → B˜(M, {mi}). For any (K, d) and ((M, {mi}),(P, {pi})) ∈ M(∞)\r
any ∼-twisting cochain φ : K → M on the tensor product K ⊗ P determines by\r
∂φ = d ⊗ idP +\r
X∞\r
i=1\r
(\r
ˆid ⊗ pi)(idK ⊗ φ ⊗ ... ⊗ φ ⊗ idP )(∆i ⊗ idP )\r
a differential, turning (K ⊗ P, ∂φ) into a differential comodule over (K, d); this\r
differential comodule is called the ∼-twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P. If M is an\r
A(∞)-algebra of the form (M, {m1, m2, 0, 0, ...}), and P is an A(∞)-module of\r
the form (P, {p1, p2, 0, 0, ...}), then φ is the usual twisting cochain, and K ⊗φ P\r
coincides with the usual twisted tensor product K ⊗φ P.\r
We need the concept of equivalence of twisting cochains (see [4], [5], [6]). We\r
say that φ, ψ : K → C are equivalent if there is a homomorphism c : K → C of\r
degree 0 for which c0 = c|C0 = 0 and ψ = (1 + c) ⋆ φ where\r
(1 + c) ⋆ φ = (1 + ˆc) · φ · (1 + c)\r
−1 − (cd + ∂c) · (1 + c)−1\r
;\r
φ ∼ ψ if and only if fφ, fψ : K → B are homotopic in the sense of [2] (coderiva\u0002tion homotopy): fφ − fψ = ∂D + D∂ with (D ⊗ fψ + ˆfφ ⊗ D)∆ = ∆D.\r
Theorem 3 If (K, d) is a differential coalgebra with free Ki, and φ : K → C is\r
an arbitrary twisting cochain, then there exists a ∼-twisting cochain φ\r
∗\r
: K →\r
H(C) such that φ and f\r
