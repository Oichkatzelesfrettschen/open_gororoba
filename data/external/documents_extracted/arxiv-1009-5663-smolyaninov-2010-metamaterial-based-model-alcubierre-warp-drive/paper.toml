Electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of emulating many exotic space-time \r
geometries, such as black holes, rotating cosmic strings, and the big bang \r
singularity. Here we present a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre warp \r
drive, and study its limitations due to available range of material parameters. It \r
appears that the material parameter range introduces strong limitations on the \r
achievable “warp speed”, so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials cannot be \r
used. On the other hand, newly developed “perfect” bi-anisotropic non-reciprocal \r
magnetoelectric metamaterials should be capable of emulating the physics of warp \r
drive gradually accelerating up to 1/4c. \r
PACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 42.25.Bs. \r
Metamaterial optics [1,2] greatly benefited from the field theoretical ideas developed to \r
describe physics in curvilinear space-times [3]. Unprecedented degree of control of the \r
local dielectric permittivity εik and magnetic permeability μik tensors in electromagnetic \r
metamaterials has enabled numerous recent attempts to engineer highly unusual “optical \r
spaces”, such as electromagnetic black holes [4-8], wormholes [9], and rotating cosmic \r
strings [10]. Phase transitions in metamaterials are also capable of emulating physical 

2 \r
processes which took place during and immediately after the big bang [11,12]. These \r
models can be very informative for phenomena where researchers have no direct \r
experience and therefore limited intuition. \r
 Since its original introduction by Alcubierre [13], the warp drive spacetime has \r
become one of the most studied geometries in general relativity. In the simplest form it \r
can be described by the metric \r
( ) 222 2 22 )( −−−−= dzdydtrvdxdtcds (1) \r
where is the distance from the center of the “warp bubble”, \r
v0 is the warp drive velocity, and v=v0f(r). The function f(r) is a smooth function \r
satisfying f(0)=1 and for \r
(( ) 2/1 2 22\r
0 ++−= zytvxr\r
rf → 0)(\r
)\r
r → ∞ . This metric describes an almost flat \r
spheroidal “warp bubble” which is moving with respect to asymptotically flat external \r
spacetime with an arbitrary speed v0. Such a metric bypasses the speed limitation due to \r
special relativity: while nothing can move with speeds greater than the speed of light \r
with respect to the flat background, spacetime itself has no restriction on the speed with \r
which it can be stretched. One example of fast stretching of the spacetime is given by \r
the inflation theories, which demonstrate that immediately after the big bang our \r
Universe expanded exponentially during an extremely short period of time. \r
Unfortunately, when the spacetime metric (1) is plugged into the Einstein’s \r
equations, it is apparent that exotic matter with negative energy density is required to \r
build the warp drive. In addition, it was demonstrated that the eternal superluminal warp \r
drive becomes unstable when quantum mechanical effects are introduced [14]. Another \r
line of research deals with a situation in which a warp drive would be created at a very \r
low velocity, and gradually accelerated to large speeds. Physics of such a process is also \r
quite interesting [15]. We should point out that the warp drive space-time cannot be 

3 \r
reduced to a simple combination of a white-hole and a black-hole event horizons. Such \r
a combination would be non-controversial and “easy” to realize. The difference between \r
the warp drive space-time and such a white-hole/black-hole combination is that the flat \r
space-time region inside the warp bubble is moving as a whole with respect to the flat \r
space-time outside the warp bubble (see metric in eq.(1)) . This non-trivial property of \r
the warp drive space-time has led to conclusion that it cannot be realized even at sub\u0002luminal speeds. Very recently it was demonstrated that even low speed sub-luminal \r
warp drives generically require energy-conditions-violating matter [16]: the T00\r
component of the energy-momentum tensor (the energy density distribution) appears to \r
be negative even at sub-luminal speeds. Therefore, even subluminal warp drives appear \r
to be prohibited by the laws of physics. \r
In this paper we demonstrate that electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of \r
emulating the warp drive metric (1). Since energy conditions violations do not appear to \r
be a problem in this case, metamaterial realization of the warp drive is possible. Our \r
result is interesting because the body of evidence collected so far seemed to indicate that \r
the warp drives operating at any speed (even sub-luminal) were strictly prohibited by \r
the laws of Nature \r
Below we will find out what kind of metamaterial geometry is needed to \r
emulate a laboratory model of the warp drive, so that we can build more understanding \r
of the physics involved. It appears that the available range of material parameters \r
introduces strong limitations on the possible “warp speed”. Nevertheless, our results \r
demonstrate that physics of a gradually accelerating warp drive can be modeled based \r
on newly developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17]. Since even low 

4 \r
velocity physics of warp drives is quite interesting [15,16], such a lab model deserves \r
further study. \r
To avoid unnecessary mathematical complications, let us consider a 1+1 \r

This inequality demonstrates that while “the true warp drive” in vacuum ( ) is \r
prohibited, values in a material medium make a warp drive model \r
thermodynamically stable at least at subluminal speeds. This is an important result \r
because the body of evidence collected so far seems to indicate that the warp drives \r
operating at any speed are strictly prohibited by laws of Nature. Equation (10) also \r
provides an upper bound on the largest possible “warp speed”, which is achievable \r
within the described metamaterial model. This upper bound is reached at , and \r
equals to v0=1/4c. Therefore, at the very least, we can build a toy model of a warp drive \r
“operating” at v0~1/4c. Coordinate dependence of the metamaterial parameters in such a \r
model is shown in Fig.1 assuming \r

However, in classical magnetoelectric materials, such as Cr2O3 and \r
multiferroics, actual values of magnetoelectric susceptibilities are two orders of \r
magnitude smaller than the limiting value described by eq. (9) [21], so that the warp \r
drive model is impossible to make with ordinary materials. On the other hand, recently 

6 \r
developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17], which can be built based on \r
such designs as split ring resonators, fishnet structures [22], etc. allow experimentalists \r
to reach the limiting values described by eq.(9), and make a lab model of the warp drive \r
possible. Following ref.[17], the effective susceptibilities of the split ring metamaterial \r
can be written in the RLC-circuit model as \r

where n is the split ring density, d is the gap in the ring, S is the ring area, and C is the \r
gap capacitance. These expressions explicitly demonstrate that the split ring \r
metamaterial considered in ref. [17] satisfies the upper bound given by eq.(9), and \r
therefore can be used as one of the building blocks in the metamaterial warp drive \r
design. On the other hand, this particular split-ring design cannot be used without \r
modification, since this metamaterial is reciprocal. \r
 An actual laboratory demonstration of a metamaterial warp drive space time \r
would require a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial, in which both spatial and \r
time reversal symmetries are broken. In addition, the metamaterial loss issue has to be \r
overcome. Since the issue of metamaterial loss compensation using gain media is well \r
studied (see for example recent experimental demonstration of loss compensation in a \r
negative index metamaterial [23]) let us concentrate on the experimental ways of \r
breaking spatial and time reversal symmetries. Breaking the mirror x ↔ -x symmetry is \r
most easily achieved by deformation of the metamaterial, which can be easily done in \r
either one of the most popular split ring [17] or fishnet [22] metamaterial designs. As far \r
as breaking the time-reversal t ↔ -t symmetry is concerned, there are two most natural 

7 \r
ways to break this symmetry in solids: application of external magnetic field [24,25], or \r
spin-orbit interaction in a nonsymmorfic lattice [26]. In addition, such chiral \r
superconductors as Sr2RuO4 [27] may be used in superconducting metamaterial designs \r
[28]. Application of external electric and magnetic fields is known to break both spatial \r
and time symmetries of such materials as methyl-cyclopentadienyl-Mn-tricarbonil \r
molecular liquids [24], thus creating an illusion of a moving (non-reciprocal bi\u0002anisotropic) medium [25]. Experimental results of ref. [24] do indeed demonstrate this \r
behavior (however, the emulated “medium velocity” is very low, of the order of 50 nm/s \r
[25]). Since utilization of magnetized particles, such as ferrites is easily applicable in \r
the metamaterial design, all the ingredients necessary for experimental realization of the \r
Alcubierre metric have been demonstrated in the experiment. Moreover, we should \r
point out that very recently it was also asserted [29,30] that material parameters, which \r
are necessary to achieve a warp drive imitation in a nanostructured metamaterial are \r
indeed possible. \r
Let us come back to the split ring-based “perfect magnetoelectric metamaterial” \r
design implemented in [17], and demonstrate how the time-reversal symmetry may be \r
broken in this metamaterial. One of the possible metamaterial geometries is shown \r
schematically in Fig.2. An elementary unit of the split ring-based “perfect \r
magnetoelectric metamaterial” design of ref.[17] is supplemented with a magnetized \r
ferrite particle. The particle is magnetized and shifted along the x-direction with respect \r
to the center of the split ring. Thus, this geometry explicitly violates spatial and time \r
reversal symmetries, resulting in a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial. As \r
demonstrated in [31], near the ferromagnetic resonance frequency in such a \r
metamaterial

where ω0 is the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, and ωm=γM0. Thus, in the design \r
presented in Fig.2 gx is proportional to the particle magnetization M0 in a given location, \r
which explicitly demonstrate the non-reciprocal nature of this metamaterial design. \r
Time reversal t ↔ -t leads to change of sign of gx. We should also note that very \r
recently a somewhat related metamaterial design has been proposed in ref.[32] , which \r
emulates medium motion at an arbitrary speed. While demonstrating the proof of \r
principle, the designs presented in Fig.2 and ref.[32] may only be considered as a first \r
step. Such complicated metamaterial designs typically contain many unwanted terms in \r
ε, μ and g, which must be carefully eliminated by iteration, so that the ideal form of \r
eqs.(8) may be achieved. \r
Light rays propagation inside the metamaterial model of the warp drive \r
“operating” at 1/4c is illustrated in Fig.3. The metamaterial medium (1) outside the \r
warp bubble is engineered to have properties of a medium moving towards the warp \r
bubble with the designed warp speed, while medium (3) is “moving” away from the \r
bubble. In the reference frame moving with the warp speed these media look exactly the \r
same as medium (2) at rest. Ray trajectories were calculated assuming a step-like \r
profile. Rays are emitted by a point source located at the origin point (0,0,0) of the \r
coordinate frame inside the “warp bubble” (marked as medium (2)). Boundaries of the \r
warp bubble are located at x=±5 (they are marked by the dashed lines). At large enough \r
incidence angles light rays originating inside the “warp bubble” cannot penetrate into \r
medium (3) (in the hypothetical superluminal warp drive this would be true for any \r
incidence angle: this boundary would look like a white hole event horizon). On the \r
) ~(\r
~ xf

other hand, all the light rays propagating towards the other boundary of the “warp \r
bubble” can propagate into medium (1). Note that the metamaterial medium (1) is \r
identical to medium (3). \r
 In conclusion, we have presented a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre \r
warp drive metric. It appears that the material parameter range introduces strong \r
limitations on the achievable “warp speed”, so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials \r
cannot emulate the warp drive. On the other hand, newly developed “perfect” \r
magnetoelectric bi-anisotropic non-reciprocal metamaterials should be capable of \r
emulating the physics of gradually accelerating warp drive, which can reach “warp \r
speeds” up to 1/4c. \r

Electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of emulating many exotic space-time \r

drive, and study its limitations due to available range of material parameters. It \r
appears that the material parameter range introduces strong limitations on the \r

Metamaterial optics [1,2] greatly benefited from the field theoretical ideas developed to \r
describe physics in curvilinear space-times [3]. Unprecedented degree of control of the \r
local dielectric permittivity εik and magnetic permeability μik tensors in electromagnetic \r
metamaterials has enabled numerous recent attempts to engineer highly unusual “optical \r
spaces”, such as electromagnetic black holes [4-8], wormholes [9], and rotating cosmic \r
strings [10]. Phase transitions in metamaterials are also capable of emulating physical 

2 \r
processes which took place during and immediately after the big bang [11,12]. These \r
models can be very informative for phenomena where researchers have no direct \r
experience and therefore limited intuition. \r
 Since its original introduction by Alcubierre [13], the warp drive spacetime has \r
become one of the most studied geometries in general relativity. In the simplest form it \r
can be described by the metric \r
( ) 222 2 22 )( −−−−= dzdydtrvdxdtcds (1) \r
where is the distance from the center of the “warp bubble”, \r
v0 is the warp drive velocity, and v=v0f(r). The function f(r) is a smooth function \r
satisfying f(0)=1 and for \r
(( ) 2/1 2 22\r
0 ++−= zytvxr\r
rf → 0)(\r
)\r
r → ∞ . This metric describes an almost flat \r
spheroidal “warp bubble” which is moving with respect to asymptotically flat external \r
spacetime with an arbitrary speed v0. Such a metric bypasses the speed limitation due to \r
special relativity: while nothing can move with speeds greater than the speed of light \r
with respect to the flat background, spacetime itself has no restriction on the speed with \r
which it can be stretched. One example of fast stretching of the spacetime is given by \r
the inflation theories, which demonstrate that immediately after the big bang our \r
Universe expanded exponentially during an extremely short period of time. \r
Unfortunately, when the spacetime metric (1) is plugged into the Einstein’s \r
equations, it is apparent that exotic matter with negative energy density is required to \r
build the warp drive. In addition, it was demonstrated that the eternal superluminal warp \r
drive becomes unstable when quantum mechanical effects are introduced [14]. Another \r
line of research deals with a situation in which a warp drive would be created at a very \r
low velocity, and gradually accelerated to large speeds. Physics of such a process is also \r
quite interesting [15]. We should point out that the warp drive space-time cannot be 

3 \r
reduced to a simple combination of a white-hole and a black-hole event horizons. Such \r
a combination would be non-controversial and “easy” to realize. The difference between \r
the warp drive space-time and such a white-hole/black-hole combination is that the flat \r
space-time region inside the warp bubble is moving as a whole with respect to the flat \r
space-time outside the warp bubble (see metric in eq.(1)) . This non-trivial property of \r
the warp drive space-time has led to conclusion that it cannot be realized even at sub\u0002luminal speeds. Very recently it was demonstrated that even low speed sub-luminal \r
warp drives generically require energy-conditions-violating matter [16]: the T00\r
component of the energy-momentum tensor (the energy density distribution) appears to \r
be negative even at sub-luminal speeds. Therefore, even subluminal warp drives appear \r
to be prohibited by the laws of physics. \r
In this paper we demonstrate that electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of \r
emulating the warp drive metric (1). Since energy conditions violations do not appear to \r
be a problem in this case, metamaterial realization of the warp drive is possible. Our \r
result is interesting because the body of evidence collected so far seemed to indicate that \r
the warp drives operating at any speed (even sub-luminal) were strictly prohibited by \r
the laws of Nature \r
Below we will find out what kind of metamaterial geometry is needed to \r
emulate a laboratory model of the warp drive, so that we can build more understanding \r
of the physics involved. It appears that the available range of material parameters \r
introduces strong limitations on the possible “warp speed”. Nevertheless, our results \r
demonstrate that physics of a gradually accelerating warp drive can be modeled based \r
on newly developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17]. Since even low 

4 \r
velocity physics of warp drives is quite interesting [15,16], such a lab model deserves \r
further study. \r
To avoid unnecessary mathematical complications, let us consider a 1+1 \r

This inequality demonstrates that while “the true warp drive” in vacuum ( ) is \r
prohibited, values in a material medium make a warp drive model \r
thermodynamically stable at least at subluminal speeds. This is an important result \r
because the body of evidence collected so far seems to indicate that the warp drives \r
operating at any speed are strictly prohibited by laws of Nature. Equation (10) also \r
provides an upper bound on the largest possible “warp speed”, which is achievable \r
within the described metamaterial model. This upper bound is reached at , and \r
equals to v0=1/4c. Therefore, at the very least, we can build a toy model of a warp drive \r
“operating” at v0~1/4c. Coordinate dependence of the metamaterial parameters in such a \r
model is shown in Fig.1 assuming \r

However, in classical magnetoelectric materials, such as Cr2O3 and \r
multiferroics, actual values of magnetoelectric susceptibilities are two orders of \r
magnitude smaller than the limiting value described by eq. (9) [21], so that the warp \r
drive model is impossible to make with ordinary materials. On the other hand, recently 

6 \r
developed “perfect” magnetoelectric metamaterials [17], which can be built based on \r
such designs as split ring resonators, fishnet structures [22], etc. allow experimentalists \r
to reach the limiting values described by eq.(9), and make a lab model of the warp drive \r
possible. Following ref.[17], the effective susceptibilities of the split ring metamaterial \r
can be written in the RLC-circuit model as \r

where n is the split ring density, d is the gap in the ring, S is the ring area, and C is the \r
gap capacitance. These expressions explicitly demonstrate that the split ring \r
metamaterial considered in ref. [17] satisfies the upper bound given by eq.(9), and \r
therefore can be used as one of the building blocks in the metamaterial warp drive \r
design. On the other hand, this particular split-ring design cannot be used without \r
modification, since this metamaterial is reciprocal. \r
 An actual laboratory demonstration of a metamaterial warp drive space time \r
would require a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial, in which both spatial and \r
time reversal symmetries are broken. In addition, the metamaterial loss issue has to be \r
overcome. Since the issue of metamaterial loss compensation using gain media is well \r
studied (see for example recent experimental demonstration of loss compensation in a \r
negative index metamaterial [23]) let us concentrate on the experimental ways of \r
breaking spatial and time reversal symmetries. Breaking the mirror x ↔ -x symmetry is \r
most easily achieved by deformation of the metamaterial, which can be easily done in \r
either one of the most popular split ring [17] or fishnet [22] metamaterial designs. As far \r
as breaking the time-reversal t ↔ -t symmetry is concerned, there are two most natural 

7 \r
ways to break this symmetry in solids: application of external magnetic field [24,25], or \r
spin-orbit interaction in a nonsymmorfic lattice [26]. In addition, such chiral \r
superconductors as Sr2RuO4 [27] may be used in superconducting metamaterial designs \r
[28]. Application of external electric and magnetic fields is known to break both spatial \r
and time symmetries of such materials as methyl-cyclopentadienyl-Mn-tricarbonil \r
molecular liquids [24], thus creating an illusion of a moving (non-reciprocal bi\u0002anisotropic) medium [25]. Experimental results of ref. [24] do indeed demonstrate this \r
behavior (however, the emulated “medium velocity” is very low, of the order of 50 nm/s \r
[25]). Since utilization of magnetized particles, such as ferrites is easily applicable in \r
the metamaterial design, all the ingredients necessary for experimental realization of the \r
Alcubierre metric have been demonstrated in the experiment. Moreover, we should \r
point out that very recently it was also asserted [29,30] that material parameters, which \r
are necessary to achieve a warp drive imitation in a nanostructured metamaterial are \r
indeed possible. \r
Let us come back to the split ring-based “perfect magnetoelectric metamaterial” \r
design implemented in [17], and demonstrate how the time-reversal symmetry may be \r
broken in this metamaterial. One of the possible metamaterial geometries is shown \r
schematically in Fig.2. An elementary unit of the split ring-based “perfect \r
magnetoelectric metamaterial” design of ref.[17] is supplemented with a magnetized \r
ferrite particle. The particle is magnetized and shifted along the x-direction with respect \r
to the center of the split ring. Thus, this geometry explicitly violates spatial and time \r
reversal symmetries, resulting in a non-reciprocal bi-anisotropic metamaterial. As \r
demonstrated in [31], near the ferromagnetic resonance frequency in such a \r
metamaterial

where ω0 is the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, and ωm=γM0. Thus, in the design \r
presented in Fig.2 gx is proportional to the particle magnetization M0 in a given location, \r
which explicitly demonstrate the non-reciprocal nature of this metamaterial design. \r
Time reversal t ↔ -t leads to change of sign of gx. We should also note that very \r
recently a somewhat related metamaterial design has been proposed in ref.[32] , which \r
emulates medium motion at an arbitrary speed. While demonstrating the proof of \r
principle, the designs presented in Fig.2 and ref.[32] may only be considered as a first \r
step. Such complicated metamaterial designs typically contain many unwanted terms in \r
ε, μ and g, which must be carefully eliminated by iteration, so that the ideal form of \r
eqs.(8) may be achieved. \r
Light rays propagation inside the metamaterial model of the warp drive \r
“operating” at 1/4c is illustrated in Fig.3. The metamaterial medium (1) outside the \r
warp bubble is engineered to have properties of a medium moving towards the warp \r
bubble with the designed warp speed, while medium (3) is “moving” away from the \r
bubble. In the reference frame moving with the warp speed these media look exactly the \r
same as medium (2) at rest. Ray trajectories were calculated assuming a step-like \r
profile. Rays are emitted by a point source located at the origin point (0,0,0) of the \r
coordinate frame inside the “warp bubble” (marked as medium (2)). Boundaries of the \r
warp bubble are located at x=±5 (they are marked by the dashed lines). At large enough \r
incidence angles light rays originating inside the “warp bubble” cannot penetrate into \r
medium (3) (in the hypothetical superluminal warp drive this would be true for any \r
incidence angle: this boundary would look like a white hole event horizon). On the \r
) ~(\r
~ xf

other hand, all the light rays propagating towards the other boundary of the “warp \r
bubble” can propagate into medium (1). Note that the metamaterial medium (1) is \r
identical to medium (3). \r
 In conclusion, we have presented a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre \r
warp drive metric. It appears that the material parameter range introduces strong \r
limitations on the achievable “warp speed”, so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials \r
cannot emulate the warp drive. On the other hand, newly developed “perfect” \r
magnetoelectric bi-anisotropic non-reciprocal metamaterials should be capable of \r
emulating the physics of gradually accelerating warp drive, which can reach “warp \r
speeds” up to 1/4c. \r
