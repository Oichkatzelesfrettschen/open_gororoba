RANGE CONVERGENCE MONOTONICITY FOR VECTOR\r
MEASURES AND RANGE MONOTONICITY OF THE\r
MASS\r
JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Abstract. We prove that the range of sequence of vector measures\r
converging widely satisfies a weak lower semicontinuity property, that\r
the convergence of the range implies the strict convergence (convergence\r
of the total variation) and that the strict convergence implies the range\r
convergence for strictly convex norms. In dimension 2 and for Euclidean\r
spaces of any dimensions, we prove that the total variation of a vector\r
measure is monotone with respect to the range.\r

1. Introduction\r
A vector measure µ maps some Σ–measurable subsets of a space X to\r
vectors in a linear space V [1, Chapter 1; 8; 13]. Vector measures ap\u0002pear naturally in calculus of variations and in geometric measure theory,\r
as derivatives of functions of bounded variation (BV) [6] and as currents of\r
finite mass [10]. In these contexts, it is natural to work with sequences of\r
finite Radon measures and to study their convergence.\r
The wide convergence of a sequence (µn)n∈N of finite vector measures\r
to some finite vector measure µ is defined by the condition that for every\r
compactly supported continuous test function ϕ ∈ Cc(X, R), one has\r
limn→∞ ˆ\r

The strict convergence, which requires the total variation to converge also,\r
is an important concept that brings one back into a setting similar to tight\r
sequences of probability measures.\r
The total variation of a vector measure µ is defined in terms of a seminorm\r
|·|V on V by\r
|µ|V (X) , sup ( X\r
E∈P\r
|µ(E)|V : P is a finite Σ–measurable partition of X\r
)\r
.\r
For real-valued signed Radon measures, V = R and the mass depends only,\r
up to a constant positive multiple, on the vector structure of the space V .\r
This is not any more the case when V is a finite-dimensional vector space\r
of dimension greater than 1 (dim V > 1). The norms on the space V are\r
all equivalent, but induce total variations whose values are not connected\r
mutually beyond the bounds given by equivalence of seminorms.\r
This lack of connection between various total variations is the starting\r
question of the present work. Reshetnyak [16] and Delladio [7] have proved\r
that strict convergence with respect to a strictly convex norm is a sufficient\r
assumption to obtain strict convergence with respect to any another norm\r
on V (see also [21] for the mass with respect to a Euclidean norm).\r
In order to characterize strict convergence through a topological object,\r
independent of a choice of norm, we propose to describe strict convergence\r
with the range of a vector measure µ, which is defined as 1\r
rg µ (X) , conv \b\r
µ(A) : A ∈ Σ\r
\t\r
.\r
In particular, when V = R, we have\r
(1.1) rg µ (X) = [µ\r
−(X), µ+(X)],\r
where µ = µ\r
+ + µ−, with µ+ ≥ 0, µ− ≤ 0, and µ+ and µ− are mutually\r
singular, so that for any widely converging sequence of vector measures,\r
the convergence of the range is equivalent with the convergence of the mass\r
[5, Appendix C].\r
In general, the range of a vector measure characterizes uniquely the total\r
variation of a measure [18]. This result is stable under convergence as the\r
range convergence implies in general the mass convergence:\r
Theorem 1.1. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space endowed\r
with its Borel σ-algebra B(X), let V be a finite-dimensional space and let\r
|·|V be a seminorm on V . If (µn)n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures\r
from X to V that converges widely to some vector Borel measure µ, and\r
if the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff\r
distance, then\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X).\r
The assumption on the convergence is described in terms of Hausdorff dis\u0002tance; this choice is in practice inconsequential: since the space V is finite\u0002dimensional, the Hausdorff convergence of compact convex sets is equivalent\r
1Classically, the range of a vector measure is defined [8] as the closure of the set\r
{µ(A) : A ⊂ X is Σ–measurable}. This definition coincides with ours as soon as µ has no\r
atoms [8, Corollary 9.5; 14]. Our notion has the advantage of being always a convex set\r
and is natural in view of the link between range and the total variation [18, Theorem 3].

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 3\r
to the Kuratowski convergence and to the convergence of the support func\u0002tions [20, Corollaries 3A and P4.A] (see also [15]).\r
The converse statement of Theorem 1.1 does not hold in general. In fact,\r
the strict convexity of the norm appears as a necessary condition to have\r
range convergence:\r
Proposition 1.2. If the locally compact separable metric space X is not\r
discrete and if the seminorm |·|V is not strictly convex, then there exists a\r
sequence (µn)n∈N of Borel vector measures from X to V converging widely\r
to some vector measure µ such that (|µn|V (X))n∈N converges to |µ|V (X) but\r
(rg µn (X))n∈N is constant and different from rg µ (X).\r
We prove that strict convexity is in fact a necessary and sufficient condi\u0002tion for the equivalence between range convergence and mass convergence:\r
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and (V, |·|V )\r
be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. If the norm |·|V is strictly convex\r
and if (µn)n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures from X to V that\r
converges widely to some vector measure µ, then\r
limn→∞rg µn (X) = rg µ (X)\r
if and only if\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X).\r
The above result completely characterizes the strict convergence in terms\r
of range convergence. In comparison to mass convergence, the definition\r
of the rank depends on V only as a topological vector space, and does not\r
require any specific choice of norm.\r
The proof of Theorem 1.3 follows a more general approach due to Reshet\u0002nyak [16], relying on layerwise decomposition technique.\r
Theorem 1.3 shows that mass convergence implies range convergence in a\r
strictly convex setting. It is also known [18] that equality of the range implies\r
equality of the variation. This leads to the question whether the mass of a\r
measure depends monotonically on its range, that is, whether the inclusion\r
of sets rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) does imply the inequality |ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).\r
In the case where the norm |·|V is Euclidean, we prove such a relation:\r
Theorem 1.4. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a semi-norm |·|V . If either dim V ≤ 2 or |·|V is Euclidean, then if Σ is\r
a σ–algebra on X and the vector measures ν, µ : Σ → V satisfy\r
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X),\r
then\r
|ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).\r
If moreover the norm |·|V is strictly convex, equality in the above conclusion\r
occurs if and only if the ranges are equal.\r
In higher dimensions, we do not know if such relation still holds.\r
Open problem 1. If dim V ≥ 3 and if V is endowed with an arbitrary (re\u0002spectively strictly) convex norm, is the mass (respectively strictly) monotone\r
with respect to range inclusion?

4 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Our approach to prove Theorem 1.4 when V is a Euclidean space directly\r
derives from the a representation formula\r
(1.2) |v|V =\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, vi| dσ(η)\r
for some suitable multiple of the uniform measure σ on the unit sphere S of\r
V\r
⋆\r
. We will prove that (1.2) implies the representation formula\r
Theorem 1.5. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a Euclidean norm |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector\r
measure µ : Σ → V and every A ∈ Σ,\r
|µ|V (A) = ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, vi|(A) dσ(η).\r
The representation formula (1.2) means that the norm is an L\r
1\r
-norm in\r
the sense of Choquet [4, Paragraph 41], and that the unit ball of the dual\r
norm is a zonoid [2, Theorem 2.1; 4]. In the two-dimensional case, any\r
centrally symmetric convex set is a zonoid [2, Theorem 5.4; 4] and, in fact,\r
any norm has a similar representation for some positive even measure σ this\r
implies a counterpart of Theorem 1.5 for any two-dimensional norm. The\r
latter characterization of zonoids fails in higher dimensions: for example\r
the ℓ∞ norm whose whose dual ℓ\r
1 ball is hyperoctahedron, which is not a\r
zonoid.\r
In dimension 2, one has similar representation for any choice of norm,\r
and strict convexity translates by density of the support for the representing\r
measure σ.\r
When the vector space V is two-dimensional, we improve the geometric\r
interplay between range convergence and mass convergence, by drawing the\r
following link:\r
Theorem 1.6. Assume that V is a two-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a seminorm |·|V . If Σ is a σ–algebra on X and if µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure, then\r
|µ|V (X) = 1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
rg µ (X)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Here PerV (rg µ (X)) is the perimeter of the closed convex set rg µ (X),\r
computed with respect to the seminorm |·|V . When the target space V\r
is equipped with a strictly convex norm, the perimeter becomes strictly\r
monotone and Theorem 1.3 may be derived from Theorem 1.6. This kind\r
of isoperimetric inequalities for convex sets were also investigated in [12].\r
Theorem 1.6 is the extension of the one-dimensional formula |µ|(X) =\r
diam rg µ (X) that follows from (1.1).\r
For the two-dimensional case, Theorem 1.3 may be derived also from the\r
integral representation (1.2).\r
2. Total variation and range\r
2.1. Vector measures. We assume that X is a space endowed with a σ–\r
algebra Σ and that the space V is a finite-dimensional vector space on the\r
real numbers. The space V\r
∗\r
is the algebraic dual of V and hη, vi = η(v)

denotes the duality product defined by the action of the linear form η ∈ V\r
∗\r
on the vector v ∈ V .\r
A vector measure µ : Σ → V is a countably additive function; when\r
V = R it is a (finite) signed measure. A vector measure µ induces definitions\r
of integrals\r
ˆ\r
A\r
f dµ ∈ V and ˆ\r
A\r
hg, dµi ∈ R.\r
for all Σ–measurable and bounded functions f : X → R and g : X → V\r
∗\r
and sets A ∈ Σ. These integrals satisfy for every E ∈ Σ and η ∈ V\r

,\r
ˆ\r
A\r
χE dµ = µ(A ∩ E) and ˆ\r
A\r
hη χE, dµi = hη, µ(A ∩ E)i,\r
and the usual additivity, linearity and dominated convergence properties.\r
2.2. Total variation. The total variation of a vector measure is defined as\r
follows (see [1, Definition 1.4 (b)]).\r
Definition 2.1. Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X. The total variation of a vector\r
measure µ : Σ → X with respect to a seminorm |·|V is the function |µ|V :\r
Σ → [0, +∞] defined for each set A ∈ Σ by\r
|µ|V (A)\r
, sup ( Xm\r
n=1\r
|µ(En)|V : E1, . . . , Em ∈ Σ, E1, . . . , Em ⊆ A\r
and the sets E1, . . . , Emare pairwise disjoint ).\r
The total variation enjoys properties that make of it a finite measure\r
[1, Theorem 1.6].\r
Proposition 2.2 (Finiteness). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let µ : Σ → V\r
be a vector measure. For every A ∈ Σ, |µ|V (A) < +∞.\r
Proposition 2.3 (Monotonicity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let µ : Σ → V\r
be a vector measure and let A, B ∈ Σ. If A ⊆ B, then\r
|µ|V (A) ⊆ |µ|V (B).\r
Proposition 2.4 (Countable additivity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and\r
let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure. For every sequence (An)n∈N of disjoint\r
sets in Σ,\r
|µ|V\r
S\r
n∈N An\r
\u0001\r
=\r
X\r
n∈N\r
|µ|V (An).\r
We also have some algebraic properties:\r
Proposition 2.5 (Triangle inequality). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let\r
µ, ν : Σ → V be vector measures. For every A ∈ Σ,\r
|µ + ν|V (A) ≤ |µ|V (A) + |µ|V (A).\r
Proposition 2.6 (Homogeneity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and let µ :\r
Σ → V be a vector measure. For every λ ∈ R and every A ∈ Σ,\r
|λµ|V (A) = |λ| |µ|V (A).

If X is a locally compact separable metric space, we endow it with its Borel\r
σ-algebra B(X). This topological setting on X is common when thinking\r
of C0(X)\r
⋆ as the space of finite measures on X, every finite measure being\r
Radon measures because X is second-countable and metric. In particular,\r
whatever the choice of the norm |·|V on V , the variation measure |µ|V is a\r
Radon measure.\r
Proposition 2.7. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space. If\r
µ : B(A) → V is a vector measure and if A ⊂ X is open, then\r
|µ|V (A) = sup \u001Aˆ\r

is the algebraic dual space of the vector space V and\r
(2.1) |η|V ′ , sup \b\r
hη, vi : v ∈ V and |v|V ≤ 1\r
\t\r
.\r
Equivalently, η ∈ V\r
′\r
if and only if for every v ∈ V , |v|V = 0 implies\r
hη, vi = 0. By the Hahn–Banach theorem for seminorms (see for exam\u0002ple [3, Theorem 1.1]), one has\r
(2.2) |v|V = sup \bhη, vi : η ∈ V\r
′\r
and |v| ≤ 1\r
\t\r
.\r
Since V and V\r
′ are finite-dimensional, the suprema in (2.1) and (2.2) are\r
achieved in view of the Weierstrass extreme value theorem.\r
The proof of Proposition 2.7 is a transposition of the proof when V is\r
Euclidean and X is separable [1, Proposition 1.47].\r
Proof of Proposition 2.7. Let E1, . . . , Em ∈ B(X) be disjoint subsets of A\r
and, in view of (2.2), let η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ be linear forms such that for\r
every i ∈ {1, . . . , m} |ηi|V ′ = 1 and hηi\r
, µ(Ei)i = |µ(Ei)|V . Since µ is\r
a vector measure, |µ|V is a finite measure (Propositions 2.2 and 2.4) and\r
thus by Lusin’s theorem there exists a function ψ ∈ C(A, V ′) such that\r
|µ|V ({x ∈ A : ψ(x) 6=\r
Pm\r
n=1 ηnχEn\r
(x)}) < ε. Without loss of generality\r
we can assume that |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1. Since the set A is σ–compact and in view\r
Urysohn’s lemma for locally compact spaces [19, lemma 2.12], there exists\r
a sequence of functions (θj )j∈N in Cc(A, [0, 1]) that converges everywhere to\r
1 in the set A. Therefore, by multiplying ψ by θj for j ∈ N large enough,\r
we can assume that ψ ∈ Cc(A, V ′) and |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 everywhere in A. We then\r
have\r

Conversely, if ψ ∈ Cc(A, V ′) and |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 on A, then there exist an\r
integer m ∈ N, forms η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ and pairwise disjoint sets E1, . . . , Em ∈\r
B(A) such that for each n ∈ {1, . . . , m}, |ηn|V ′ ≤ 1 and En ⊆ A and such\r
that if g =\r

|µ(En)|V ≤ |µ|V (A). \u0003\r
From now on, even if not stated explicitly, X will be assumed to be a\r
locally compact separable metric space endowed with its Borel σ-algebra\r
Σ = B(X).\r
2.3. Range. The range of a measure has a definition that has some analo\u0002gies with the total variation.\r
Definition 2.8. The range of the vector measure µ : Σ → V on a set A ∈ Σ\r
is the set\r
rg µ (A) , conv \b\r
µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂ A\r
\t\r
⊆ V.\r
Here, conv H denotes the closed convex hull of a set H ⊂ V . The range\r
defined by Definition 2.8 only depends on the structure of V as a topological\r
vector space.\r
If µ =\r
Pk\r
i=1 viδxi\r
, with x1, . . . , xk ∈ X distinct points, then Definition 2.8\r
gives for every A ∈ Σ\r
rg µ (A) = (X\r
d\r
i=1\r
tivi: 0 ≤ ti ≤ χA(xi)\r
)\r
.\r
If X ⊂ R\r
N is a Borel-measurable set and if µ , wLN , where w : X → V is\r
a Borel-measurable function, then\r
rg µ (A) = (ˆ\r
X\r
fw dL\r
N : f : X → R is Borel measurable\r
and 0 ≤ f ≤ χA in X\r
)\r
.\r
It follows immediately from the Definition 2.8 that the set rg µ (A) is\r
a closed convex subset of the space V and that 0 ∈ rg µ (A). Moreover,\r
rg µ (A) = {0} if and only if µ = 0.\r
Since for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A, µ(A \\ E) = µ(A) − µ(E), we\r
have rg µ (A) = µ(A) − rg µ (A), that is, the set rg µ (A) is symmetric with\r
respect to the vector µ(A)/2 ∈ V .\r
In a finite-dimensional space V , the range is always bounded (see Propo\u0002sition 2.2).\r
Proposition 2.9. Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X. If µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure, then for every A ∈ Σ, the set rg µ (A) is bounded.\r
This property fails in general if the domain is not a σ-algebra [8, Exam\u0002ple 8, Proposition 11].

8 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Proof of Proposition 2.9. Since V is finite-dimensional, there exist vectors\r
v1, . . . , vd ∈ V and linear forms η1, . . . , ηd ∈ V\r
′\r
such that d = dim V and for\r
every i, j ∈ {1, . . . , d}, hηi, vj i = δij , where δij denotes Kronecker’s delta.\r
In particular, we have for every v ∈ V , v =\r
Pd\r
i=1 vihηi\r
, vi, and thus, for\r
every set E ∈ Σ, µ(E) = Pd\r
i=1 viµi(E), where µi(E) = hηi\r
, µ(E)i. For every\r
i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, the set function µiis a finite signed measure and thus by the\r
Hahn–Jordan decomposition theorem it can be decomposed as µi = µ\r
+\r
i +µ\r
−\r
i\r
,\r
where µ\r
+\r
i ≥ 0, µ\r
−\r
i ≤ 0 are finite Borel measures [5, Appendix C]. Hence\r
rg µ (A) ⊆\r
\u001AXn\r
i=1\r
τivi: for every i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, µ\r
−\r
i\r
(A) ≤ τi ≤ µ\r
+\r
i\r
(A)\r
\u001B\r
,\r
and thus the set rg µ (A) is bounded. \u0003\r
The range is monotone with respect to the set, as was the total variation\r
(Proposition 2.3).\r
Proposition 2.10 (Monotonicity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let µ : Σ →\r
V be a vector measure and let A, B ∈ Σ. If A ⊆ B, then\r
rg µ (A) ⊆ rg µ (B).\r
Proof. This follows directly from Definition 2.8. \u0003\r
Finally the range has a countable additivity property as the total variation\r
(Proposition 2.4).\r
Proposition 2.11 (Countable additivity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let\r
µ : Σ → V be a vector measure and let (An)n∈N be a sequence of disjoint\r
sets in Σ. Then\r
rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) = P\r
n∈N rg µ (An).\r
Here P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) denotes the set of finite sums of elements in the sets\r
rg µ (An).\r
Since the range is compact (Proposition 2.9), Proposition 2.11 implies\r
that if A1, . . . , Ak ∈ Σ are disjoint, we have\r
rg µ\r
\u0010Sk\r
n=1 An\r
\u0011\r
=\r
Pk\r
n=1 rg µ (An).\r
If we drop in Proposition 2.11 the assumption that the sets (An)n∈N are\r
disjoint we obtain\r
rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) ⊆\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An).\r
Proof of Proposition 2.11. We first assume that v ∈\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). Then\r
there exists k ∈ N and v0, . . . , vk such that for each n ∈ {0, . . . , k}, vn ∈\r
rg µ (An) and v =\r
Pk\r
i=0 vn. By definition of the range, for every n ∈\r
{0, . . . , k}, vn = limℓ→∞ v\r
ℓ\r
n\r
, where\r
v\r
ℓ\r
n ∈ conv \b\r
µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂ An\r
\t\r
⊆ V.\r
Hence we have by additivity of the measure,\r
v\r
ℓ ,\r
X\r
k\r
n=0\r
v\r
ℓ\r
n ∈ conv \u001A\r
µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂\r
[n\r
i=0\r
An\r
\u001B

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 9\r
and, by closedness of the range, v ∈ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An). We have thus proved\r
that P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) ⊆ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An). Since the range is a closed set by\r
definition, we deduce that P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) ⊆ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An)\r
Conversely, we observe that if E ⊂\r
S\r
n∈N An, then by countable additivity\r
of the measure µ, we have µ(E) = P\r
n∈N µ(E ∩ An) ∈\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). It\r
then follows that rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) ⊆\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). \u0003\r
The range operation is also compatible with the linear structure of vector\r
measures. First it is sublinear with respect to the sum of measures, as was\r
the total variation Proposition 2.5.\r
Proposition 2.12 (Triangle inequality). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and\r
let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure. For every A ∈ Σ,\r
rg(µ + ν) (A) ⊆ rg µ (A) + rg ν (A).\r
The range is not linear. Indeed, in general one has rg(µ − µ) (A) = {0} 6=\r
rg µ (A) + rg(−µ) (A).\r
Proof of Proposition 2.12. One has for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A,\r
µ(E) ∈ rg µ (A)+ rg ν (A). Since the range is convex and bounded (Proposi\u0002tion 2.9), the set rg µ (A) + rg ν (A) is closed and convex and the conclusion\r
follows. \u0003\r
The range operation is also stable under linear mappings in the target.\r
Proposition 2.13 (Linearity of the range). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let\r
V, W be finite-dimensional spaces and let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure.\r
For every T ∈ Lin(V, W),\r
rg(T ◦ µ) (X) = T\r
\r
rg µ (X)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
In particular, if λ ∈ R and A ∈ Σ, we have\r
(2.3) rg(λ µ) (A) = λ rg µ (A),\r
which is the counterpart of Proposition 2.6.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.13. If E ∈ Σ and if E ⊆ A, then we have (T ◦µ)(E) =\r
T(µ(E)). It follows then that\r
conv ({T ◦ µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})\r
= T(conv ({µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})\r
We observe now that if the set H ⊂ V is convex and bounded, then by conti\u0002nuity and compactness in the finite-dimensional space V , T(H) = T(H). \u0003\r
The topological structure on the space X can be used to characterize the\r
range by duality on test functions.\r
Proposition 2.14. If X is a locally compact separable metric space and if\r
µ : B(X) → V is a vector Borel measure and if the set A ⊂ X is open, then\r
rg µ (A) = \u001Aˆ\r
A\r
ϕdµ : ϕ ∈ Cc(A, [0, 1])\u001B.\r
Proposition 2.14 is the counterpart of Proposition 2.7 for the range.

10 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Proof of Proposition 2.14. Let E ∈ B(X). Since µ is a vector measure,\r
|µ|V (X) is a finite measure (Propositions 2.2 and 2.4) and thus by Lusin’s\r
theorem there exists a function ϕ ∈ C(X) such that |µ|V ({x ∈ X : ϕ(x) 6=\r
χE(x)}) ≤ ε). Since the set A is open and σ–compact, we can assume\r
without loss of generality that ϕ ∈ Cc(A, [0, 1]). We then have\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
µ(E) −\r
ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµ\r
\f\r

\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
≤ ε|µ|V (A).\r
This implies thus that\r
µ(E) ∈\r
\b\r
hµ, ϕi : ϕ ∈ Cc(X, [0, 1])\t.\r
Conversely, if ϕ ∈ Cc(A), there exists a Borel-measurable function f :\r
A → [0, 1] that takes only finitely may values and such that |f − ϕ| ≤ ε on\r
A. We then have\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f\r
ˆ\r
A\r
f dµ −\r
ˆ\r
A\r
ϕdµ\r
\f\r
\f\r
\f ≤ ε|µ|V\r
and\r
ˆ\r
A\r
f dµ ∈ conv {µ(E) : E ∈ B(X) and E ⊂ X},\r
so that by Definition 2.8\r
ˆ\r
A\r
ϕdµ ∈ rg µ (A). \u0003\r
2.4. Links between the range and the total variation. In the one\u0002dimensional case, there is a straightforward relationship between the range\r
and the mass.\r
Proposition 2.15. Assume that dim(V ) = 1. If µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure and A ∈ Σ, then\r
|µ|V (A) = diam(rg µ (A)).\r
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that V = R. Let µ =\r
µ\r
+ + µ− be the Hahn–Jordan decomposition (see e.g. [5, Appendix C]) into\r
measures µ\r
+ ≥ 0 and µ− ≤ 0. One has then\r
|µ|(A) = µ\r
+(A) − µ−(A)\r
and\r
rg µ (A) = [µ\r
−(A), µ+(A)],\r
and the conclusion follows. \u0003\r
In higher dimensions, the mass and the range are still related by a quan\u0002titative bound.\r
Proposition 2.16 (Comparison between total variation and range). Let\r
(V, |·|V ) be a seminormed space. There exists a constant C > 0 such that for\r
every Σ–algebra on the space X and every vector measure µ : Σ → V and\r
every A ∈ Σ, we have\r
rg µ (A) ⊂ BV (0, |µ|V (A))\r
and\r
|µ|V (A) ≤ C sup \b|v|V : v ∈ rg µ (A)\r
\t\r
.

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 11\r
Diestel and Uhl have a similar statement for the semivariation of a vector\r
measure in a Banach space [8, Proposition I.1.11].\r
Proof of Proposition 2.16. For the first part of the proposition, by Defini\u0002tion 2.1, for every set E ∈ Σ such that E ⊆ A we have\r
|µ(E)|V ≤ |µ(E)|V + |µ(A \\ E)|V ≤ |µ|V (A),\r
and the assertion follows from Definition 2.8.\r
For the second part, let η1, . . . , ηd be a basis of V\r
′\r
. By (2.2), there exists\r
a constant C1 > 0 such that for every v ∈ V ,\r
|v|V ≤ C1\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
|hηi, vi|.\r
It follows then that if the sets E1, . . . , Eℓ ∈ Σ are pairwise disjoint and if\r
E1, . . . , Eℓ ⊂ A, we have\r
X\r
ℓ\r
n=1\r
|µ(Ei)|V ≤ C1\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
X\r
ℓ\r
n=1\r
|hηi, µ(Ei)i| ≤ C1\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
|hηi, µ(Ei)i|V (A),\r
and using Proposition 2.15 we infer\r
X\r
ℓ\r
n=1\r
|µ(Ei)|V ≤ C2 sup \b|v|V : v ∈ rg µ (A)\r
\t\r
. \u0003\r
Proposition 2.16 implies the continuity of the range with respect to the\r
seminorm induced by the total variation.\r
Proposition 2.17. If µ, ν : Σ → V and A ∈ Σ, then\r
dH(rg ν (A),rg µ (A)) ≤ |ν − µ|V (A).\r
Here dH(rg ν (A),rg µ (A)) denotes the Hausdorff distance between non\u0002empty compact subsets of V : if K1, K2 ⊂ V are non-empty compact sets,\r
dH(K1, K2) , inf \bε > 0 : K1 ⊆ K2 + B(0, ε) and K2 ⊆ K1 + B(0, ε)\r
\t\r
.\r
Proposition 2.17 implies in particular that if the sequence (µn)n∈N con\u0002verges in total variation to µ on A, then the sequence of sets (rg µn (A))n∈N\r
converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.17. By the triangle inequality for the range (Propo\u0002sition 2.12), we have\r
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg(ν − µ) (X) + rg µ (X).\r
By Proposition 2.16, we have\r
rg(ν − µ) (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ).\r
We conclude then that\r
rg ν (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ) + rg µ (X).\r
By symmetry, we also have\r
rg µ (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ) + rg ν (X),\r
and the conclusion follows from the definition of Hausdorff distance. \u0003

12 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
A second property is the fact that the range determines univocally the\r
image: if two measures share the same range on a set A, then their total\r
variation on that set coincides [18].\r
Proposition 2.18 (Rodríguez-Piazza). Let µ, ν : Σ → V be vector mea\u0002sures. If rg µ (X) = rg ν (X), then |µ|V (X) = |ν|V (X).\r
The next lemma highlights the key property used by Rodríguez-Piazza\r
to prove Proposition 2.18. It is an adaptation, in terms of total masses,\r
of a representation principle for the norm by finite combination of positive\r
values of linear functionals [18, Lemma 2].\r
Lemma 2.19. Let |·|V be a seminorm on V . For each ε > 0, there exists\r
η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ and α1, . . . , αm ∈ {−1, 1} such that, for every Σ–algebra on\r
the space X and every vector measure µ : Σ → V , we have\r

The proof follows the strategy of [18, Theorem 3].\r
Proof of Lemma 2.19. Fix ε > 0. There exist forms η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ and\r
α1, . . . , αm ∈ {−1, 1} such that for each v ∈ V , we have\r

(see [2, Theorem 2.8; 4, p. 53; 17, Lemma 1].) Let δ > 0. By definition of\r
total mass there exists a finite partition P∗ ⊂ Σ of A such that\r
X\r
E∈P∗\r
|µ(E)|V ≥ |µ|V (A) − δ.\r
and for every i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, there exists a finite partition Pi ⊂ Σ of A such\r
that\r
X\r
E∈Pi\r
|hηi, µ(E)i| ≥ |hηi, µi|(A) − δ.\r
If we now take P to be a common refinement the partitions of P∗,P1, . . . ,Pm,\r
we have\r
X\r
E∈P\r
|µ(E)|V ≥ |µ|V (A) − δ\r
and\r
X\r
E∈P\r
|hηi, µ(E)i| ≥ |hηi, µi|(A) − δ.\r
It follows then that\r

Rodríguez-Piazza’s Proposition 2.18 can be deduced immediately from\r
Lemma 2.19.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.18. Let ε > 0 and let then η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ and\r
α1, . . . , αm ∈ {−1, 1} be given by Lemma 2.19. Since rg µ (A) = rg ν (A),\r
we have for every i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, in view of Proposition 2.15,\r
|hηi, µi|(A) = diam(rghηi, µi(A)) = diam(rghηi, νi(A)) = |hηi, νi|(A),\r
and therefore by Lemma 2.19,\r
\f\r
\f\r
|ν|V (A) − |µ|V (A)\r
\f\r
\f ≤ ε\r
\r
|ν|V (A) + |µ|V (A)\r
\u0001\r
;\r
since ε > 0 is arbitrary, the conclusion follows. \u0003\r
2.5. Wide convergence. The notion of wide convergence of measures is\r
classically defined by testing the measure against compactly supported func\u0002tions.\r
Definition 2.20. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space. A\r
sequence of vector measures (µn)n∈N from X to V converges widely to some\r
vector measure µ whenever for every ϕ ∈ Cc(X),\r
limn→∞ ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµn =\r
ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµ.\r
The wide convergence is compatible with the linear structure of V . If\r
T ∈ Lin(V, W) and if the sequence (µn)n∈N converges widely to µ, then\r
(T ◦ µn)n∈N converges widely to T ◦ µ.\r
A classical result is the lower semicontinuity of the mass under weak\r
convergence.\r
Proposition 2.21. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and let\r
(V, |·|V ) be a seminormed finite-dimensional space. If (µn)n∈N is a sequence\r
of vector measures from X to V widely converging to some vector measure\r
µ : B(X) → V , then\r
|µ|V (X) ≤ lim inf\r
n→∞\r
|µn|V (X).\r
Proof. Let ψ ∈ Cc(X, V ′) and assume that |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 everywhere in X. By\r
Proposition 2.7 for every n ∈ N,\r
ˆ\r
X\r
hψ, dµni ≤ |µn|V ,\r
and thus, in view of Definition 2.20\r
ˆ\r
X\r
hψ, dµni = limn→∞ ˆ\r
X\r
hψ, dµni ≤ lim inf\r
n→∞\r
|µn|V .\r
We conclude by Proposition 2.7. \u0003\r
In order to have an analogue for the range, we define the Kuratoswki\r
lower limit of a sequence of set.\r
Definition 2.22. The Kuratowski lower limit of a sequence (Cn)n∈N of sub\u0002sets of V is defined as\r
lim inf\r
n→∞\r
Cn ,\r
n\r
limn→∞xn : the sequence (xn)n∈N converges in V\r
and for every n ∈ N, xn ∈ Cn\r
o\r
.

14 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
By a diagonal argument, the Kuratowski lower limit lim infn→∞ Cn is\r
always a closed set. Moreover, if Cn is convex for every n ∈ N, then the\r
Kuratowski lower limit lim infn→∞ Cn is convex. Similarly, if for every n ∈\r
N, 0 ∈ Cn, then 0 ∈ lim infn→∞ Cn.\r
Proposition 2.23 (Weak lower-semi continuity of the range). If (µn)n∈N\r
is a sequence of vector measures from X to V that converges widely to some\r
vector measure µ : B(X) → V , then\r
rg µ (X) ⊆ lim inf\r
n→∞\r
rg µn (X).\r
Moreover, for every ε > 0, if n ∈ N is large enough\r
rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε).\r
In general, the inclusion is strict. Indeed if the space X is not discrete\r
and V 6= {0}, there exists a point x ∈ X and a sequence (xn)n∈N in X \\ {x}\r
converging to x. If v ∈ V \\ {0}, the sequence (vδx − vδxn\r
)n∈N converges\r
widely to 0, but the range of any of its terms is [−v, v] while the range of\r
the limit is 0, so that the inclusion is strict.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.23. For every ϕ ∈ Cc(X, [0, 1]), we observe that for\r
every n ∈ N, in view of Proposition 2.14\r
limn→∞ ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµn ∈ rg µn (X)\r
Hence in view of Definitions 2.20 and 2.22, we have\r
ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµ = limn→∞ ˆ\r
X\r
ϕdµn ∈ lim inf\r
n→∞\r
rg µn (X).\r
Since the Kuratowski lower limit lim infn→∞ rg µn (X) is closed and convex,\r
the conclusion follows from Proposition 2.14.\r
For the additional assertion, let ε > 0. Since the set rg µ (X) is compact,\r
there exists a finite set F ⊆ rg µ (X) such that\r
(2.4) rg µ (X) ⊆ F + B(0, ε/2).\r
Since the set F is finite, by the first part of the proof, when n ∈ N is large\r
enough\r
(2.5) F ⊂ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε/2)\r
and thus by (2.4) and (2.5) we have\r
(2.6) rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε). \u0003\r
3. Convergence of the total variation and of the range\r
We consider in this section the relationship, for widely converging se\u0002quences between convergence of the range and convergence of the total vari\u0002ation.

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 15\r
3.1. Range convergence implies mass convergence. If a sequence of\r
vector measures converges widely and if its ranges converge, then its total\r
variations converge.\r
Proof of Theorem 1.1. We fix ε ∈ (0, 1) and we let η1, . . . , ηm ∈ V\r
′ and\r
α1, . . . , αm ∈ R be given by Lemma 2.19, so that\r
(1−ε)|µn|V (X) ≤ (1+ε)|µ|V (X)+Xm\r
i=1\r
\f\r
\fαi\r
|hηi, µi|V (X) − αi|hηi, µni|V (X)\r
\f\r
\f\r
.\r
We observe that for every n ∈ N and every i ∈ {1, . . . , m},\r
\f\r
\fdiam(hηi\r
,rg µn (X)i) − diam(hηi,rg µn (X)i)\r
\f\r
\f\r
≤ 2 |ηi|V ′ dH(rg µn (X),rg µ (X)).\r
By Proposition 2.21 and by Proposition 2.15, we have, as n → ∞,\r
|hηi, µni|V (X) = diam(hηi,rg µn (X)i)\r
→ diam(hηi,rg µ (X)i) = |hηi, µi|V (X).\r
If ε < 1, it follows that\r
lim sup\r
n→∞\r
|µn|V (X) ≤\r
1 + ε\r
1 − ε\r
|µ|V (X).\r
The conclusion follows by letting ε → 0. \u0003\r
3.2. One-dimensional case. When dim V = 1, the convergence of the\r
range is equivalent to the convergence of the total variation.\r
Proposition 3.1. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and\r
let V be a one-dimensional space. Let (µn)n∈N be sequence from X to V\r
converging widely to some vector measure µ. If\r
lim sup\r
n→∞\r
|µn|(X) ≤ |µ|(X),\r
then the sequence rg µn (X)\r
\u0001\r
n∈N\r
converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff dis\u0002tance.\r
Proof. Let ε > 0. By Proposition 2.23, if n ∈ N is large enough, we have\r
(3.1) rg µ (X) ⊆ rg µn (X) + B(0, ε).\r
It follows then that\r
(3.2) rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X)\r
+ B\r
\r
0,\r
\r
ε + diam(rg µn (X)) − diam(rg µ (X))\u0001\r
+\r
\u0001\r
.\r
The conclusion follows from (3.1) and (3.2) since ε > 0 is arbitrary. \u0003\r
A corollary of the one dimensional case described above in Proposition 3.1\r
is the following equivalence criterion for range convergence, in terms of\r
masses of projection measures:

16 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Corollary 3.2. Let (µn)n∈N be a sequence of vector measures. The sequence\r
(rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance if, and only if,\r
for every η ∈ V\r
′\r
,\r
lim sup\r
n→∞\r
|hη, µni|(X) ≤ |hη, µi|(X).\r
Proof. Let ε > 0. For every η ∈ V\r
′\r
, the sequence (hη, µni)n∈N of signed\r
measures converges widely to the signed measure hη, µi. By Proposition 3.1,\r
we have then\r
(3.3) limn→∞dH\r
\r
rghηi, µni(X),rghηi, µi(X)\r
\u0001\r
= 0.\r
Since the set rg µ (X) ⊂ V is compact and convex, there exist η1, . . . , ηm ∈\r
V\r
′ and δ > 0 such that\r
(3.4) rg µ (X) ⊆\r
\b\r
v ∈ V : for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, hηi, vi ≤ 1\r
\t\r
and\r
(3.5) \bv ∈ V : for each i ∈ {1, . . . , m} hηi, vi ≤ 1 + δ\r
\t\r
⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, δ).\r
In particular, if n ∈ N is large enough, we have by Proposition 2.13 and by\r
(3.3) and (3.4),\r
sup hηi,rg µn (X)i = sup rg hηi, µni(X) ≤ 1 + δ,\r
and thus by (3.5)\r
(3.6) rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).\r
We conclude the first implication by combining the inclusion (3.6) with\r
Proposition 2.23. The converse claim of the proposition follows from the\r
fact that range convergence always implies mass convergence, and\r
|hη,rg µ (X)i| = |µ|V˜ ,\r
where V˜ is the vector space V endowed with the degenerate norm\r
|x|V˜ = |(x, η) |. \u0003\r
3.3. Higher-dimensional case. In this section, we prove an equivalence\r
result between convergence of the range and convergence of the total mass,\r
when the mass is taken with respect to any strictly convex norm.\r
A seminorm |·|V is strictly convex whenever if the vectors v, w ∈ V are\r
linearly independent, then\r
|v + w|V < |v|V + |w|V .\r
As claimed in Proposition 1.2 stated in the introduction, strict convex\u0002ity of the norm is necessary to enforce the convergence of ranges. The\r
proof of Proposition 1.2 we propose is based on an straightforward counter\u0002example involving Dirac masses:\r
Proof of Proposition 1.2. Since by our assumption the seminorm |·|V is not\r
strictly convex, there exist two linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V \\ {0}\r
such that |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V . Since the space X is not discrete, there

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 17\r
exists a point x ∈ X and a sequence of points (xn)n∈N in X \\ {x} that\r
converges to x. We define for each n ∈ N, the vector measure\r
µn , v δx + w δxn\r
.\r
The sequence (µn)n∈N then widely converges to the measure µ = (v + w) δx\r
and we have for each n ∈ N\r
|µ|V (X) = |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V = |µn|V (X).\r
On the other hand the range of rg µn (X) = conv {0, v, w, v + w} while\r
rg µ (X) = conv {0, v + w} corresponds to the diagonal of the parallelogram\r
rg((X) µn). Since the vectors v and w are linearly independent, the sequence\r
of ranges does not converge. \u0003\r
In particular, by Proposition 1.2 and Proposition 3.1 there exists a linear\r
map T : V → R such that the sequence (|T ◦ µn|(Ω))n∈N does not converge\r
to |T ◦ µ|(Ω). That is, in contrast with wide convergence and with conver\u0002gence of ranges, the convergence of total variations is not invariant under\r
linear changes of variables.\r
Theorem 3.3. Assume that X is a locally compact separable metric space,\r
and let (µn)n∈N be a sequence of vector measures weakly converging to some\r
vector measure µ. If |·|V is a strictly convex norm on V such that\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X),\r
then the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Haus\u0002dorff distance.\r
The proof follows lines of thought from the work of Reshetnyak [16, The\u0002orem 3], Since the approach requires some tools from measure theory, we\r
repeat the proof with explanations on how the tools are used, and we chain\r
the argument with Corollary 3.2 to obtain Hausdorff convergence of the\r
ranges.\r
Proof of Theorem 3.3. For all n ∈ N, let χµn be the indicator measure [16]\r
of |µ|V , defined as the unique measure\r
χµ : B(X × S) → [0, +∞)\r
acting on any continuous function ϕ ∈ C(X × S, R) as\r

Since we are working with vector measures, and because the ranges and\r
the masses remain uniformly bounded for n ∈ N, we may pass to subse\u0002quences and assume without loss of generality that the sequence (χµn\r
)n∈N\r
weakly converges to some measure ρ. As in [16, Theorem 3], we are going to\r
prove that the limit ρ actually equals χµ, the indicator function of |µ|V . To\r
that purpose, we use [16, Theorem 1] to obtain a layerwise decomposition\r
(ω, λ) of the indicator measure ρ [16], in the sense that ω : X → [0, +∞) is\r
a positive measure and λ : X → MB(S)\r
\u0001\r
is a function such that for every\r
ϕ ∈ C(X × S),\r
ˆ\r
X×S\r
ϕ(x, e) dρ(v, e) = ˆ\r
X\r
ˆ\r
S\r
ϕ(x, e) dλ(x, e) dω(x).

18 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
Moreover, for this layerwise decomposition, the function\r
x ∈ X 7→ u(x) = ˆ\r
S\r
e dλ(x, e)\r
is B(X)-measurable and for every A ∈ B(X),\r
(3.7) ˆ\r
A\r
u(x) dω(x) = ˆ\r
A\r
ˆ\r
S\r
e dλ(x, e) dω(x) = µ(A).\r
The existence of such decomposition with relation (3.7) only uses the weak\r
convergence assumption µn ⇀ µ. By convexity of the norm, we have\r
(3.8) |u(x)|V ≤\r
ˆ\r
S\r
dλ(x, e) ≤ 1.\r
Those inequality follow from [16, Theorem 1], where it is proved that λ(x, S) =\r
1 for ω-almost-all x ∈ X. Integrating left sides of the above inequality (3.8)\r
with respect to the measure ω also yields\r
ˆ\r
X\r
|u(x)|V dω(x) ≤\r
ˆ\r
X\r
ˆ\r
S\r
dλ(x, e) dω(e) = ˆ\r

and by construction of ρ:\r

X×S\r
dρ(x, e) = limn→∞ ˆ\r
X×S\r
dχµn\r
(x, e) = limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X).\r
Thus\r
ˆ\r
X\r
|u(x)|V dω(x) ≤ |µ|V .\r
For A ∈ B(X) an arbitrary Borel set, we observe that\r

A\r

d|µ|V = µ(A) = ˆ\r

Considering the Radon-Nikodym derivatives of |µ|V and ω with respect to\r
the measure σ , (|µ|V + ω), we obtain\r

d(ω + |µ|V )\r
dσ =\r

positive measures, we take norms on both sides of (3.9) and we integrate\r
both sides with respect to σ to obtain\r

The strict convexity of the norm |·|V may be used to observe that in fact,\r
λ(x, ·) is a Dirac mass at u(x), for |µ|V -almost-all x ∈ X. Indeed, this\r
follows from the fact that\r

which is possible if and only if λ(x, ·) is a multiple of a Dirac mass. The\r
concentration point should thus be u(x), and the multiple is 1.\r
Now we fix an arbitrary direction η ∈ S. Considering again Radon\u0002Nikodym derivatives, it is straightforward to check the identity\r

and therefore, by definition of ρ, we obtain\r
limn→∞|hµn, ηi|(X) = |hµ, ηi|(X).\r
Since this holds for all η ∈ S, we obtain Hausdorff convergence of the range,\r
by Corollary 3.2. \u0003\r
Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 3.3 imply immediately Theorem 1.3.\r
4. Zonal representation of masses\r
In this section, we develop a geometric approach to manage the relation\r
between range convergence and mass convergence. Although the geometric\r
approach will give much less results when dim(V ) ≥ 3, it provides an in\u0002teresting geometric point of view of the relation between mass convergence\r
and strict convergence when dim(V ) = 2.\r
4.1. Zonal representation formula. We will show that seminorms hav\u0002ing a zonal representation have an associated mass that has an integral\r
representation.\r
Definition 4.1. A locally finite non-negative Borel measure σ : B(V\r
′\r
) →\r
[0, +∞] is a zonal representation of a seminorm |·|V whenever\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|η|V ′ dσ(η) < +∞,\r
and for every v ∈ V ,\r
|v|V =\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, vi| dσ(η).

20 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
As an example, we can consider the standard Euclidean norm in R\r
2 and\r
the uniform measure ν on the unit circle S ⊂ R\r
2\r
, giving\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hv, ei| dρ(e) = |v|2\r
2π\r
ˆ 2π\r
0\r
| cos(θ)| dθ = |v|2\r
2\r
π\r
,\r
and the zonal representation holds with σ =\r
π\r
2\r
ρ.\r
More generally, every Euclidean norm admits a zonal representation.\r
Theorem 4.2 (Representation of Euclidean norms). If |·|V is a Euclidean\r
semi-norm on V , then it admits a zonal representation.\r
Proof. Up to a linear isometry and an orthogonal projection, we can assume\r
that V = R\r
d and |·|V = |·|2 is the standard Euclidean norm. Then we have\r
|v|2 = α\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hv, ei| dσ(e),\r
where σ is the uniform surface measure on the Euclidean sphere S, and\r
α = α(d) > 0 is a normalization constant. The above identity directly\r
follows from the fact that the uniform surface measure is the unique (up to\r
multiplication constants) Borel measure on S that is stable under isometries\r
of R\r
d\r
. \u0003\r
A norm |·|V has a zonal representation if and only if the associated unit\r
ball in V\r
⋆\r
is a zonoid, which can be defined as the ranges of vector measure\r
[2, Theorem 2.1; 4].\r
If V is a two-dimensional space, every norm has a zonal representation\r
in the sense of Definition 4.1 ([2, Theorem 5.4; 4, 41.2]). This follows from\r
the fact that, in the plane R\r
2\r
, every symmetric compact convex set may\r
be approximated by a symmetric convex polygon with is automatically a\r
zonotope in R\r
2\r
.\r
For example, the usual Euclidean norm is represented by the uniform\r
measure on the dual sphere S of V\r
′\r
since the uniform measure is the only\r
(up to multiplicative constants) invariant measure under rotations and thus,\r
balls induced by its associated norm are Euclidean balls. This argument is\r
also valid in higher dimensions.\r
Another example is given by the ℓ\r
1\r
-norm on R\r
d defined for v ∈ Rd by\r
|v|∞ ,\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
|v1|,\r
which can be represented with σ =\r
Pd\r
i=1 δηi\r
, where ηi(v1, . . . , vd) = vi.\r
In higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3, there are some norms that do not have\r
a zonal representation. If v = (v1, . . . , vd) ∈ R\r
d\r
, then\r
|v|∞ = max{|v1|, . . . , |vd|}.\r
has no zonal representation of the form Definition 4.1 by any positive mea\u0002sure σ. Indeed, if such measure σ existed, then its dual ball, which is the\r
ℓ\r
1–ball, should be a zonotope. However, the 1–ball is a hyperoctahedron,\r
which has some 2–dimensional that are triangles, and is thus not a zonotope\r
[2, Theorem 3.3].

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 21\r
The above example is not related with the fact that the ℓ\r
1 and ℓ∞ norms\r
are not strictly convex. In fact, there are also strictly convex norms that\r
are do not have a zonal representation Definition 4.1. Indeed, in R\r
3\r
, the\r
p–norm does not have a zonal representation, if p ≥\r
log 3\r
log 3\r
2\r
, and for every\r
p > 2 it is known that the p–norm does not have a zonal representation is\r
the dimension is large enough [2, (32); 23, Proposition 2].\r
Remark 4.3. If σ\r
′\r
: B(V\r
′\r
) → [0, +∞) is a measure such that for every Borel\r
cone C ∈ B(V\r
′\r
), σ\r
′\r
(C) = σ(C), then for every v ∈ V ,\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, vi| dσ\r
′\r
(η) = ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, vi| dσ(η)\r
and for every vector measure µ : Σ → V ,\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ\r
′\r
(η) = ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η).\r
In particular, the measure σ satisfying the assumption of Lemma 4.4 is not\r
unique; a canonical representative can be given by requiring sigma to be an\r
even measure supported on the unit sphere of V\r
′\r
.\r
The existence of zonal representation of the norm in V automatically\r
implies a similar representation formula for the mass. It may be seen as\r
an alternative way of representing the mass, without relying on layerwise\r
decompositions.\r
Lemma 4.4 (Representation of the mass). If σ : B(V\r
′\r
) → R\r
+ is a zonal\r
representation of |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector measure\r
µ : Σ → V and every A ∈ Σ,\r
|µ|V (A) = ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η).\r
Proof. If E1, . . . , Em ∈ Σ are disjoints subsets of A, we have\r
Xm\r
i=1\r
|µ(Ei)|V =\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
Xm\r
i=1\r
|hη, µ(Ei)i| dσ(η) ≤\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η)\r
and thus by the definition of total variation of a vector measure (Defini\u0002tion 2.1)\r
(4.1) |µ|V (A) ≤\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η).\r
Conversely, in view of Remark 4.3 we can assume that the measure σ is\r
supported in a compact set K ⊂ V\r
′ \\{0}. In particular σ is a finite measure.\r
Let ε > 0, there exists η1, . . . , ηm ∈ K such that\r
K ⊂\r
[m\r
i=1\r
BV ′(ηi, ε).\r
In particular, if η ∈ BV ′(ηi\r
, ε) and E ∈ Σ, we have\r
(4.2)\r
\f\r
\f\r
|hη, µi|(E) − |hηi, µi|(E)\r
\f\r
\f ≤ ε|µ|V (E).

22 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
We decompose K =\r
Sℓ\r
i=1 Ki\r
, with K1, . . . , Kℓ ∈ B(V\r
′\r
) pairwise disjoint\r
and Ki ⊂ BV ′(ηi\r
, ε). We have then by (4.2)\r
(4.3) ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η) ≤\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
σ(Ki)|hηi, µi|(A) + εσ(K)|µ|V (A).\r
Since hηi, µi is a signed measure, by the Hahn–Jordan decomposition theo\u0002rem and a common refinement, there exists a partition E1, . . . , Em ∈ Σ of\r
A such that for each i ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ},\r
(4.4) |hηi, µi|(A) = Xm\r
n=1\r
|hηi, µi(En)|.\r
We obtain thus by (4.2) again combined with (4.3) and (4.4)\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η)\r
≤\r
Xm\r
n=1\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi(En)| dσ(η) + εσ(K)\r
\u0010\r
|µ|V (A) + Xm\r
n=1\r
|µ|V (En)\r
\u0011\r
.\r
By our assumption on the seminorm this implies in turn by our assumption\r
and by additivity of the total mass (Proposition 2.4) and by the definition\r
of total variation (Definition 2.1) that\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η) ≤\r
Xm\r
n=1\r
|µ(En)|V + 2εσ(K)|µ|V (A)\r
≤ |µ|V (A) + 2εσ(K)|µ|V (A).\r
We conclude by letting ε → 0 that\r
(4.5) ˆ\r
V ′\r
|hη, µi|(A) dσ(η) ≤ |µ|V (A).\r
The conclusion then follows from (4.1) and (4.5). \u0003\r
4.2. Application to monotonicity and convergence. When V is equipped\r
with an Euclidean norm the monotony of the mass with respect to range\r
inclusion, Theorem 1.4 stated in the introduction, is a direct consequence of\r
the zonal representation, Lemma 4.4.\r
Because of the particular structure of two-dimensional vector spaces, the\r
proof we give also holds for any norm on V whenever dim V = 2.\r
Proof of Theorem 1.4. Given two vector measures µ, ν such that\r
rg µ (X) ⊆ rg ν (X),\r
we clear have, for all η ∈ S:\r
hη,rg µ (X)i ⊆ hη,rg ν (X)i.\r
Since the range commutes with linear maps, we directly obtain, for all η ∈ S:\r
rghη, µi(X) ⊆ rghη, νi(X).\r
Since the measures hη, µi and hη, νi are real-valued, we obtain\r
|hη, µi| ≤ |hη, νi|,

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 23\r
for all η ∈ S. Since V is Euclidean or dim V = 2, this implies, by Lemma 4.4,\r
|µ|V (X) ≤ |ν|V (X). If the norm is strictly convex, then the inequality is\r
strict. \u0003\r
Relying on the integral and perimeter formulae obtained above, we also\r
propose an alternative proof of Theorem 1.3.\r
We first draw a link between the support of a zonal representation and\r
strict convexity. The above characterization will turn out to be particularly\r
efficient in dimension 2.\r
Definition 4.5. A zonal representation σ : B(V\r
′\r
) → [0, +∞] of a seminorm\r
|·|V is non-degenerate whenever for every non-empty double cone C ⊂ V ,\r
σ(C) > 0.\r
We recall that the set C ⊂ V\r
′\r
is an open cone whenever for every λ ∈\r
R \\ {0} and x ∈, λC = C.\r
In dimension 2, the non-degeneracy of the zonal representation is equiva\u0002lent to strict convexity. This will turn out to be false in higher dimensions.\r
Proposition 4.6. Let V be a finite-dimensional space. Assume that σ is a\r
zonal representation of the seminorm |·|V . The norm |·|V is strictly convex\r
if and only if for every linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V , there exists\r
η ∈ supp(σ) such that hη, vi and hη, wi do not have the same sign.\r
In particular, if V is a 2-dimensional vector space, then the norm is strictly\r
convex if, and only if, σ is non-degenerate.\r
Proof of Proposition 4.6. We observe that for every η ∈ V\r
′ and v ∈ V , we\r
have\r
\f\r
\fhη, vi + hη, wi\r
\f\r
\f ≥\r
\f\r
\fhη, vi\r
\f\r
\f +\r
\f\r
\fhη, wi\r
\f\r
\f\r
,\r
with equality if and only if the numbers hη, vi and hη, wi have the same sign.\r
We have\r
|v + w|V =\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
\f\r
\fhη, vi + hη, wi\r
\f\r
\f dσ(η)\r
≥\r
ˆ\r
V ′\r
\f\r
\fhη, vi\r
\f\r
\f dσ(η) + ˆ\r
V ′\r
\f\r
\fhη, wi\r
\f\r
\f dσ(η) = |v|V + |w|V ,\r
with equality if and only if hη, vi and hη, wi have the same sign for every\r
η ∈ supp σ, since the map z ∈ V\r
′\r
7→ hη, zi is continuous.\r
In particular, if σ is a non-degenerate zonal representation, then the norm\r
|·|V is strictly convex. In the two-dimensional case dim V = 2, the sepa\u0002ration condition of Proposition 4.6 on the support conversely implies the\r
density condition on the support. Indeed, for every η ∈ V\r
′ and every δ > 0,\r
there exists v, w ∈ V such that if η\r
′ ∈ V′ and hη′\r
, vi ≤ 0 ≤ hη\r
′\r
, wi, then\r
|η − η\r
′\r
|V ′ ≤ δ. \u0003\r
Density of the support for a zonal representation of a strictly convex norm\r
in higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3 fails in general. As an example, one can\r
consider V = R\r
3 and the measure σ = σx,y + σx,z + σz,y, where σx,y is the\r
uniform measure on the circle orthogonal to the y-axis; and similarly for\r
σx,z and σz,y. Then the support supp(σ) is far from being dense in S, but

24 JUSTIN DEKEYSER AND JEAN VAN SCHAFTINGEN\r
the induced norm\r
ˆ\r
S\r
\f\r

\f dσ(η) = p\r
v1\r
2 + v22 +\r
p\r
v1\r
2 + v32 +\r
p\r
v2\r
2 + v32.\r
is strictly convex.\r
We know give another proof of Theorem 1.3 by mean of zonal integral\r
representation. We restrict ourselves to the case of Euclidean norms in the\r
case dim V ≥ 3, and strictly convex norms in the case dim V = 2.\r
Second proof of Theorem 1.3, by zonal representation. We shall only need\r
to prove that mass convergence implies convergence of the range, as the\r
converse statement holds in all generality.\r
For every η ∈ V\r
′\r
, the sequence (hη, µni)n∈N converges widely to (hη, µi)\r
and by Proposition 2.21, we have\r
(4.6) lim inf\r
n→∞\r
|hη, µni|(X) ≥ |hη, µi|(X).\r
Since |·|V is a Euclidean norm, there exists a constant κ > 0 such that for\r
every v ∈ V ,\r
(4.7) |v|V = κ\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, vi| dη\r
where S is the unit sphere in V ≃ V\r
′\r
. By Lemma 4.4 and by our assumption,\r
we have\r
(4.8) lim sup\r
n→∞ ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, µni|(X) dη ≤\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, µi|(X) dη.\r
For every η1, η2 ∈ V\r
′ and n ∈ N, we have\r
(4.9)\r
\f\r
\f\r
|hη2, µni|(X) − |hη1, µni|(X)\r
\f\r
\f ≤ |η2 − η1|V ′|µn|V (X).\r
By (4.6), (4.8) and (4.9), we deduce that for every η ∈ SV ′, we have\r
(4.10) limn→∞|hη, µni|(X) = |hη, µi|(X).\r
By homogeneity, this still holds for every η ∈ V\r
′ and the conclusion follows\r
then from Corollary 3.2. \u0003\r
5. Perimeter representation of masses\r
5.1. Perimeter formula. So far, we have used zonal representation of\r
norms in spaces of dimension 2 to approach the problem of mass convergence\r
from a geometric point of view. In particular, we were able to characterize\r
strict convexity of the norm through density of the support for the measure\r
representing the norm.\r
We now give further geometric insight of the problem, by interpreting the\r
total mass of a vector valued measure as the perimeter of its range (up to\r
some multiplicative constant).\r
We first define the perimeter of a polygon in a two-dimensional space.\r
Definition 5.1. If dim V = 2 and P ⊂ V if P is a polygon of vertices\r
v1, . . . , vℓ, we define its perimeter as\r
PerV (P) ,\r
X\r
ℓ\r
i=1\r
|vℓ − vℓ−1|V ,

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 25\r
with the convention that v0 = vℓ.\r
This notion of perimeter is analogous to the notion of perimeter in crys\u0002talline variational problems [9, 11, 22, 24].\r
The perimeter of convex polygons is monotone with respect to set inclu\u0002sion.\r
Lemma 5.2. If dim V = 2 and P1 ⊆ P2 ⊂ V are convex polygons, then\r
PerV (P1) ≤ PerV (P2).\r
Proof. Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that P1 ⊂ H and ∂H contains one\r
side of ∂P1. Then by the triangle inequality for the seminorm PerV (H∩P2) ≤\r
PerV (H). By repeating this process on each edge of the polygon P1, we reach\r
the conclusion. \u0003\r
Lemma 5.2 suggests to extend the definition of perimeter to convex sets\r
as the least upper bound of the perimeter of polygonal subsets.\r
Definition 5.3. If C ⊂ V is convex, we set\r
PerV (C) , sup \bPerV (P) : P ⊆ C is a convex polygono.\r
In view of Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3 coincide for polygons.\r
The monotonicity property of Lemma 5.2 can be transferred to arbitrary\r
subsets and the equality cases can be characterized for strictly convex norms.\r
Proposition 5.4. If C1 ⊆ C2 ⊆ V are compact convex sets, then\r
PerV (C1) ≤ PerV (C2),\r
If |·|V is a strictly convex norm and if equality holds, then C1 = C2.\r
Proof. The inequality follows from Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3.\r
For the equality case, we assume by contradiction that C1 ( C2 There\r
exists v ∈ C2 \\C1. Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that v 6∈ H and C1 ⊂ H.\r
In particular, for every w1, w2 ∈ C1, we have since |·|V is a strictly convex\r

|w2 − w1|V < |w2 − v|V + |v − w1|V .\r
We define\r

The proof of Theorem 1.6 is based on the following property of polygons.\r
Lemma 5.5. Let V be a two-dimensional vector space and |·|V be a semi\u0002norm on V . For every m ∈ N and v1, . . . , vm ∈ V , one has\r
Xm\r
n=1\r
|vn|V = 1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
[0, v1] + · · · + [0, vm]\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Lemma 5.5 implies in particular immediately that Theorem 1.6 holds\r
when µ has finite support.\r
Proof of Lemma 5.5. We proceed by induction. The identity is trivial if\r
m = 0. The induction step follows from the observation that\r
1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
[0, v1]+· · ·+[0, vm+1]\r
\u0001\r
= 1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
[0, v1]+· · ·+[0, vm]\r
\u0001\r
+|vm+1|V . \u0003\r
Proof of Theorem 1.6. If E1, . . . , Em ∈ Σ are disjoint subsets of A, then we\r
have\r
Xm\r
n=1\r
|µ(En)|V =\r
1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
[0, µ(E1)] + · · · + [0, µ(En)]\u0001.\r
Since [0, µ(E1)] + · · · + [0, µ(En)] ⊂ rg µ (A), it follows from the definition of\r
total variation (Definition 2.1) that\r
(5.2) |µ|V (A) ≤\r
1\r
2\r
PerV (rg µ (A)).\r
Conversely, if P ⊂ rg µ (A) is a polygon, there exist sets F1, . . . , Fk ∈ Σ\r
such that F1, . . . , Fk ⊆ A, µ(F1), . . . , µ(Fk) are the vertices of P. Hence there\r
exists disjoint sets E1, . . . , Em ∈ Σ such that P ⊆ [0, µ(E1)]+· · ·+[0, µ(Em)].\r
It follows thus by Definition 5.3 that\r
(5.3) 1\r
2\r
PerV (P) ≤\r
1\r
2\r
PerV\r
\r
[0, µ(E1)] + · · · + [0, µ(Em)]\u0001=\r
Xm\r
n=1\r
|µ(En)|V (A).\r
Hence by definition of total variation (Definition 2.1),\r
1\r
2\r
PerV (P) ≤ |µ|V (A)\r
and thus by definition of perimeter (Definition 5.3)\r
(5.4) 1\r
2\r
PerV (rg µ (A)) ≤ |µ|V (A).\r
The conclusion comes from the combination of (5.2) and (5.4). \u0003\r
5.2. Application to monotonicity and convergence. Theorem 1.6 gives\r
a proof of the monotonicity of the range with respect to the mass.\r
Second proof of Theorem 1.4 when dim V = 2. We apply Theorem 1.6 and\r
Proposition 5.4. \u0003\r
As a final result, we give a proof of Theorem 1.3 in the two-dimensional\r
case, based on the perimeter formula, Theorem 1.6.\r
Third proof of Theorem 1.3 by mean of perimeter formula. If the set C ⊂\r
V is compact and convex, we define the function γC : V → [0, +∞) by\r
(5.5) γC(v) , PerV\r
\r
conv (C + {v})\r
\u0001\r
.

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 27\r
We observe that, by the triangle inequality and the definitions, for every\r
v1, v2 ∈ V ,\r
(5.6) |γC(v2) − γC(v1)| ≤ 2|v2 − v1|V\r
and that if 0 ∈ C,\r
(5.7) |v|V ≤ γC(v).\r
Let ε > 0. By the Weierstrass extreme value theorem and, since |·|V is a\r
strictly convex norm, by Proposition 5.4 we have\r
δ , inf{γrg µ(X)(v) : dist(v,rg µ (X)) ≥ ε} − PerV (rg µ (X)) > 0.\r
By (5.5) and Definition 5.3 for every v ∈ V , there exists a polygon Pv ⊂\r
rg µ (X) such that\r
γPv\r
(v) ≥ γrg µ(X)(v) −\r
δ\r
4\r
.\r
Thus if |v\r
′ − v|V ≤ δ\r
16 , we have by (5.6)\r
γPv(v\r
′\r
) ≥ γrg µ(X)(v\r
′\r
) −\r
δ\r
2\r
and thus if γPv(v\r
′\r
) ≤ PerV (rg µ (X))+δ\r
2\r
, then v\r
′ ∈ rg µ (X)+B(0, ε). In view\r
of (5.7), by a compactness argument, there exists a polygon P ⊆ rg µ (X)\r
such that if γP (v) ≤ PerV (rg µ (X)) + δ\r
2\r
, then v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε). By\r
Proposition 2.23 and Definition 2.22, there exists a sequence of polygons\r
(Pn)n∈N whose vertices converge to those of P and such that for every n ∈ N,\r
Pn ⊂ rg µn (X). For every v ∈ V , we have limn→∞ γPn\r
(v) = γP (v), and\r
thus in view of (5.6), for n ∈ N large enough, if v ∈ V satisfies γPn(v) ≤\r
PerV (rg µ (X)) + δ\r
4\r
, then v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).\r
Assume now that v ∈ rg µn (X). One has then conv Pn + {v} ⊂ rg µn (X),\r
and thus if n ∈ N is large enough, we have\r
γPn(v) ≤ PerV (µn) ≤ PerV (µ) + δ\r
4\r
.\r
By construction of Pn, this implies that v ∈ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε) and thus\r
(5.8) rg µn (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) + B(0, ε).\r
The conclusion then follows from (5.8) and Proposition 2.23. \u0003\r

Abstract. We prove that the range of sequence of vector measures\r

the convergence of the range implies the strict convergence (convergence\r
of the total variation) and that the strict convergence implies the range\r
convergence for strictly convex norms. In dimension 2 and for Euclidean\r

measure is monotone with respect to the range.\r

The strict convergence, which requires the total variation to converge also,\r
is an important concept that brings one back into a setting similar to tight\r
sequences of probability measures.\r
The total variation of a vector measure µ is defined in terms of a seminorm\r
|·|V on V by\r
|µ|V (X) , sup ( X\r
E∈P\r
|µ(E)|V : P is a finite Σ–measurable partition of X\r
)\r
.\r
For real-valued signed Radon measures, V = R and the mass depends only,\r
up to a constant positive multiple, on the vector structure of the space V .\r
This is not any more the case when V is a finite-dimensional vector space\r
of dimension greater than 1 (dim V > 1). The norms on the space V are\r
all equivalent, but induce total variations whose values are not connected\r
mutually beyond the bounds given by equivalence of seminorms.\r
This lack of connection between various total variations is the starting\r
question of the present work. Reshetnyak [16] and Delladio [7] have proved\r
that strict convergence with respect to a strictly convex norm is a sufficient\r
assumption to obtain strict convergence with respect to any another norm\r
on V (see also [21] for the mass with respect to a Euclidean norm).\r
In order to characterize strict convergence through a topological object,\r
independent of a choice of norm, we propose to describe strict convergence\r
with the range of a vector measure µ, which is defined as 1\r
rg µ (X) , conv \b\r
µ(A) : A ∈ Σ\r
\t\r
.\r
In particular, when V = R, we have\r
(1.1) rg µ (X) = [µ\r
−(X), µ+(X)],\r
where µ = µ\r
+ + µ−, with µ+ ≥ 0, µ− ≤ 0, and µ+ and µ− are mutually\r
singular, so that for any widely converging sequence of vector measures,\r
the convergence of the range is equivalent with the convergence of the mass\r
[5, Appendix C].\r
In general, the range of a vector measure characterizes uniquely the total\r
variation of a measure [18]. This result is stable under convergence as the\r
range convergence implies in general the mass convergence:\r
Theorem 1.1. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space endowed\r
with its Borel σ-algebra B(X), let V be a finite-dimensional space and let\r
|·|V be a seminorm on V . If (µn)n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures\r
from X to V that converges widely to some vector Borel measure µ, and\r
if the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff\r
distance, then\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X).\r
The assumption on the convergence is described in terms of Hausdorff dis\u0002tance; this choice is in practice inconsequential: since the space V is finite\u0002dimensional, the Hausdorff convergence of compact convex sets is equivalent\r
1Classically, the range of a vector measure is defined [8] as the closure of the set\r
{µ(A) : A ⊂ X is Σ–measurable}. This definition coincides with ours as soon as µ has no\r
atoms [8, Corollary 9.5; 14]. Our notion has the advantage of being always a convex set\r
and is natural in view of the link between range and the total variation [18, Theorem 3].

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 3\r
to the Kuratowski convergence and to the convergence of the support func\u0002tions [20, Corollaries 3A and P4.A] (see also [15]).\r
The converse statement of Theorem 1.1 does not hold in general. In fact,\r
the strict convexity of the norm appears as a necessary condition to have\r
range convergence:\r
Proposition 1.2. If the locally compact separable metric space X is not\r
discrete and if the seminorm |·|V is not strictly convex, then there exists a\r
sequence (µn)n∈N of Borel vector measures from X to V converging widely\r
to some vector measure µ such that (|µn|V (X))n∈N converges to |µ|V (X) but\r
(rg µn (X))n∈N is constant and different from rg µ (X).\r
We prove that strict convexity is in fact a necessary and sufficient condi\u0002tion for the equivalence between range convergence and mass convergence:\r
Theorem 1.3. Let X be a locally compact separable metric space and (V, |·|V )\r
be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. If the norm |·|V is strictly convex\r
and if (µn)n∈N is a sequence of Borel vector measures from X to V that\r
converges widely to some vector measure µ, then\r
limn→∞rg µn (X) = rg µ (X)\r
if and only if\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X).\r
The above result completely characterizes the strict convergence in terms\r
of range convergence. In comparison to mass convergence, the definition\r
of the rank depends on V only as a topological vector space, and does not\r
require any specific choice of norm.\r
The proof of Theorem 1.3 follows a more general approach due to Reshet\u0002nyak [16], relying on layerwise decomposition technique.\r
Theorem 1.3 shows that mass convergence implies range convergence in a\r
strictly convex setting. It is also known [18] that equality of the range implies\r
equality of the variation. This leads to the question whether the mass of a\r
measure depends monotonically on its range, that is, whether the inclusion\r
of sets rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X) does imply the inequality |ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).\r
In the case where the norm |·|V is Euclidean, we prove such a relation:\r
Theorem 1.4. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a semi-norm |·|V . If either dim V ≤ 2 or |·|V is Euclidean, then if Σ is\r
a σ–algebra on X and the vector measures ν, µ : Σ → V satisfy\r
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg µ (X),\r
then\r
|ν|V (X) ≤ |µ|V (X).\r
If moreover the norm |·|V is strictly convex, equality in the above conclusion\r
occurs if and only if the ranges are equal.\r
In higher dimensions, we do not know if such relation still holds.\r
Open problem 1. If dim V ≥ 3 and if V is endowed with an arbitrary (re\u0002spectively strictly) convex norm, is the mass (respectively strictly) monotone\r
with respect to range inclusion?"""

Our approach to prove Theorem 1.4 when V is a Euclidean space directly\r
derives from the a representation formula\r
(1.2) |v|V =\r
ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, vi| dσ(η)\r
for some suitable multiple of the uniform measure σ on the unit sphere S of\r
V\r
⋆\r
. We will prove that (1.2) implies the representation formula\r
Theorem 1.5. Assume that V is a finite-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a Euclidean norm |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector\r
measure µ : Σ → V and every A ∈ Σ,\r
|µ|V (A) = ˆ\r
S\r
|hη, vi|(A) dσ(η).\r
The representation formula (1.2) means that the norm is an L\r
1\r
-norm in\r
the sense of Choquet [4, Paragraph 41], and that the unit ball of the dual\r
norm is a zonoid [2, Theorem 2.1; 4]. In the two-dimensional case, any\r
centrally symmetric convex set is a zonoid [2, Theorem 5.4; 4] and, in fact,\r
any norm has a similar representation for some positive even measure σ this\r
implies a counterpart of Theorem 1.5 for any two-dimensional norm. The\r
latter characterization of zonoids fails in higher dimensions: for example\r
the ℓ∞ norm whose whose dual ℓ\r
1 ball is hyperoctahedron, which is not a\r
zonoid.\r
In dimension 2, one has similar representation for any choice of norm,\r
and strict convexity translates by density of the support for the representing\r
measure σ.\r
When the vector space V is two-dimensional, we improve the geometric\r
interplay between range convergence and mass convergence, by drawing the\r
following link:\r
Theorem 1.6. Assume that V is a two-dimensional vector space, equipped\r
with a seminorm |·|V . If Σ is a σ–algebra on X and if µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure, then\r
|µ|V (X) = 1"""

is equipped with a strictly convex norm, the perimeter becomes strictly\r
monotone and Theorem 1.3 may be derived from Theorem 1.6. This kind\r
of isoperimetric inequalities for convex sets were also investigated in [12].\r
Theorem 1.6 is the extension of the one-dimensional formula |µ|(X) =\r

Radon measures because X is second-countable and metric. In particular,\r

|µ|V ({x ∈ A : ψ(x) 6=\r

we can assume that |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1. Since the set A is σ–compact and in view\r

a sequence of functions (θj )j∈N in Cc(A, [0, 1]) that converges everywhere to\r

we can assume that ψ ∈ Cc(A, V ′) and |ψ|V ′ ≤ 1 everywhere in A. We then\r

2.3. Range. The range of a measure has a definition that has some analo\u0002gies with the total variation.\r
Definition 2.8. The range of the vector measure µ : Σ → V on a set A ∈ Σ\r
is the set\r
rg µ (A) , conv \b\r
µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊂ A\r
\t\r
⊆ V.\r
Here, conv H denotes the closed convex hull of a set H ⊂ V . The range\r
defined by Definition 2.8 only depends on the structure of V as a topological\r
vector space.\r
If µ =\r
Pk\r
i=1 viδxi\r
, with x1, . . . , xk ∈ X distinct points, then Definition 2.8\r
gives for every A ∈ Σ\r
rg µ (A) = (X\r
d\r
i=1\r
tivi: 0 ≤ ti ≤ χA(xi)\r
)\r
.\r
If X ⊂ R\r
N is a Borel-measurable set and if µ , wLN , where w : X → V is\r
a Borel-measurable function, then\r
rg µ (A) = (ˆ\r
X\r
fw dL\r
N : f : X → R is Borel measurable\r
and 0 ≤ f ≤ χA in X\r
)\r
.\r
It follows immediately from the Definition 2.8 that the set rg µ (A) is\r
a closed convex subset of the space V and that 0 ∈ rg µ (A). Moreover,\r
rg µ (A) = {0} if and only if µ = 0.\r
Since for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A, µ(A \\ E) = µ(A) − µ(E), we\r
have rg µ (A) = µ(A) − rg µ (A), that is, the set rg µ (A) is symmetric with\r
respect to the vector µ(A)/2 ∈ V .\r
In a finite-dimensional space V , the range is always bounded (see Propo\u0002sition 2.2).\r
Proposition 2.9. Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X. If µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure, then for every A ∈ Σ, the set rg µ (A) is bounded.\r
This property fails in general if the domain is not a σ-algebra [8, Exam\u0002ple 8, Proposition 11]."""

Proof of Proposition 2.9. Since V is finite-dimensional, there exist vectors\r
v1, . . . , vd ∈ V and linear forms η1, . . . , ηd ∈ V\r
′\r
such that d = dim V and for\r
every i, j ∈ {1, . . . , d}, hηi, vj i = δij , where δij denotes Kronecker’s delta.\r
In particular, we have for every v ∈ V , v =\r
Pd\r
i=1 vihηi\r
, vi, and thus, for\r
every set E ∈ Σ, µ(E) = Pd\r
i=1 viµi(E), where µi(E) = hηi\r

i ∈ {1, . . . , d}, the set function µiis a finite signed measure and thus by the\r
Hahn–Jordan decomposition theorem it can be decomposed as µi = µ\r
+\r
i +µ\r
−\r
i\r

where µ\r

i ≥ 0, µ\r

\u001B\r

and thus the set rg µ (A) is bounded. \u0003\r
The range is monotone with respect to the set, as was the total variation\r
(Proposition 2.3).\r
Proposition 2.10 (Monotonicity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let µ : Σ →\r
V be a vector measure and let A, B ∈ Σ. If A ⊆ B, then\r
rg µ (A) ⊆ rg µ (B).\r
Proof. This follows directly from Definition 2.8. \u0003\r
Finally the range has a countable additivity property as the total variation\r
(Proposition 2.4).\r
Proposition 2.11 (Countable additivity). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let\r
µ : Σ → V be a vector measure and let (An)n∈N be a sequence of disjoint\r
sets in Σ. Then\r
rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) = P\r
n∈N rg µ (An).\r
Here P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) denotes the set of finite sums of elements in the sets\r
rg µ (An).\r
Since the range is compact (Proposition 2.9), Proposition 2.11 implies\r
that if A1, . . . , Ak ∈ Σ are disjoint, we have\r
rg µ\r
\u0010Sk\r
n=1 An\r
\u0011\r
=\r
Pk\r
n=1 rg µ (An).\r
If we drop in Proposition 2.11 the assumption that the sets (An)n∈N are\r
disjoint we obtain\r
rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) ⊆\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An).\r
Proof of Proposition 2.11. We first assume that v ∈\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). Then\r
there exists k ∈ N and v0, . . . , vk such that for each n ∈ {0, . . . , k}, vn ∈\r
rg µ (An) and v =\r

and, by closedness of the range, v ∈ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An). We have thus proved\r
that P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) ⊆ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An). Since the range is a closed set by\r
definition, we deduce that P\r
n∈N rg µ (An) ⊆ rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An)\r
Conversely, we observe that if E ⊂\r
S\r
n∈N An, then by countable additivity\r
of the measure µ, we have µ(E) = P\r
n∈N µ(E ∩ An) ∈\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). It\r
then follows that rg µ (\r
S\r
n∈N An) ⊆\r
P\r
n∈N rg µ (An). \u0003\r
The range operation is also compatible with the linear structure of vector\r
measures. First it is sublinear with respect to the sum of measures, as was\r
the total variation Proposition 2.5.\r
Proposition 2.12 (Triangle inequality). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X and\r
let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure. For every A ∈ Σ,\r
rg(µ + ν) (A) ⊆ rg µ (A) + rg ν (A).\r
The range is not linear. Indeed, in general one has rg(µ − µ) (A) = {0} 6=\r
rg µ (A) + rg(−µ) (A).\r
Proof of Proposition 2.12. One has for every E ∈ Σ such that E ⊂ A,\r
µ(E) ∈ rg µ (A)+ rg ν (A). Since the range is convex and bounded (Proposi\u0002tion 2.9), the set rg µ (A) + rg ν (A) is closed and convex and the conclusion\r
follows. \u0003\r
The range operation is also stable under linear mappings in the target.\r
Proposition 2.13 (Linearity of the range). Let Σ be a σ–algebra on X, let\r
V, W be finite-dimensional spaces and let µ : Σ → V be a vector measure.\r
For every T ∈ Lin(V, W),\r
rg(T ◦ µ) (X) = T\r
\r
rg µ (X)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
In particular, if λ ∈ R and A ∈ Σ, we have\r
(2.3) rg(λ µ) (A) = λ rg µ (A),\r
which is the counterpart of Proposition 2.6.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.13. If E ∈ Σ and if E ⊆ A, then we have (T ◦µ)(E) =\r
T(µ(E)). It follows then that\r
conv ({T ◦ µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})\r
= T(conv ({µ(E) : E ∈ Σ and E ⊆ A})\r
We observe now that if the set H ⊂ V is convex and bounded, then by conti\u0002nuity and compactness in the finite-dimensional space V , T(H) = T(H). \u0003\r
The topological structure on the space X can be used to characterize the\r
range by duality on test functions.\r
Proposition 2.14. If X is a locally compact separable metric space and if\r
µ : B(X) → V is a vector Borel measure and if the set A ⊂ X is open, then\r

Proof of Proposition 2.14. Let E ∈ B(X). Since µ is a vector measure,\r
|µ|V (X) is a finite measure (Propositions 2.2 and 2.4) and thus by Lusin’s\r

2.4. Links between the range and the total variation. In the one\u0002dimensional case, there is a straightforward relationship between the range\r
and the mass.\r
Proposition 2.15. Assume that dim(V ) = 1. If µ : Σ → V is a vector\r
measure and A ∈ Σ, then\r
|µ|V (A) = diam(rg µ (A)).\r
Proof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that V = R. Let µ =\r
µ\r
+ + µ− be the Hahn–Jordan decomposition (see e.g. [5, Appendix C]) into\r
measures µ\r
+ ≥ 0 and µ− ≤ 0. One has then\r
|µ|(A) = µ\r

and\r
rg µ (A) = [µ\r

and the conclusion follows. \u0003\r
In higher dimensions, the mass and the range are still related by a quan\u0002titative bound.\r
Proposition 2.16 (Comparison between total variation and range). Let\r

Diestel and Uhl have a similar statement for the semivariation of a vector\r
measure in a Banach space [8, Proposition I.1.11].\r
Proof of Proposition 2.16. For the first part of the proposition, by Defini\u0002tion 2.1, for every set E ∈ Σ such that E ⊆ A we have\r
|µ(E)|V ≤ |µ(E)|V + |µ(A \\ E)|V ≤ |µ|V (A),\r
and the assertion follows from Definition 2.8.\r
For the second part, let η1, . . . , ηd be a basis of V\r

a constant C1 > 0 such that for every v ∈ V ,\r
|v|V ≤ C1\r
X\r
d\r
i=1\r
|hηi, vi|.\r
It follows then that if the sets E1, . . . , Eℓ ∈ Σ are pairwise disjoint and if\r

|µ(Ei)|V ≤ C1\r

|hηi, µ(Ei)i| ≤ C1\r

ℓ\r
n=1\r
|µ(Ei)|V ≤ C2 sup \b|v|V : v ∈ rg µ (A)\r
\t\r
. \u0003\r
Proposition 2.16 implies the continuity of the range with respect to the\r
seminorm induced by the total variation.\r
Proposition 2.17. If µ, ν : Σ → V and A ∈ Σ, then\r
dH(rg ν (A),rg µ (A)) ≤ |ν − µ|V (A).\r
Here dH(rg ν (A),rg µ (A)) denotes the Hausdorff distance between non\u0002empty compact subsets of V : if K1, K2 ⊂ V are non-empty compact sets,\r
dH(K1, K2) , inf \bε > 0 : K1 ⊆ K2 + B(0, ε) and K2 ⊆ K1 + B(0, ε)\r
\t\r
.\r
Proposition 2.17 implies in particular that if the sequence (µn)n∈N con\u0002verges in total variation to µ on A, then the sequence of sets (rg µn (A))n∈N\r
converges to rg µ (X) in Hausdorff distance.\r
Proof of Proposition 2.17. By the triangle inequality for the range (Propo\u0002sition 2.12), we have\r
rg ν (X) ⊆ rg(ν − µ) (X) + rg µ (X).\r
By Proposition 2.16, we have\r
rg(ν − µ) (X) ⊆ BV (0, |ν − µ|V ).\r
We conclude then that\r

A second property is the fact that the range determines univocally the\r
image: if two measures share the same range on a set A, then their total\r

result between convergence of the range and convergence of the total mass,\r
when the mass is taken with respect to any strictly convex norm.\r
A seminorm |·|V is strictly convex whenever if the vectors v, w ∈ V are\r
linearly independent, then\r
|v + w|V < |v|V + |w|V .\r
As claimed in Proposition 1.2 stated in the introduction, strict convex\u0002ity of the norm is necessary to enforce the convergence of ranges. The\r
proof of Proposition 1.2 we propose is based on an straightforward counter\u0002example involving Dirac masses:\r
Proof of Proposition 1.2. Since by our assumption the seminorm |·|V is not\r
strictly convex, there exist two linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V \\ {0}\r
such that |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V . Since the space X is not discrete, there

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 17\r
exists a point x ∈ X and a sequence of points (xn)n∈N in X \\ {x} that\r
converges to x. We define for each n ∈ N, the vector measure\r
µn , v δx + w δxn\r
.\r
The sequence (µn)n∈N then widely converges to the measure µ = (v + w) δx\r
and we have for each n ∈ N\r
|µ|V (X) = |v + w|V = |v|V + |w|V = |µn|V (X).\r
On the other hand the range of rg µn (X) = conv {0, v, w, v + w} while\r
rg µ (X) = conv {0, v + w} corresponds to the diagonal of the parallelogram\r
rg((X) µn). Since the vectors v and w are linearly independent, the sequence\r
of ranges does not converge. \u0003\r
In particular, by Proposition 1.2 and Proposition 3.1 there exists a linear\r
map T : V → R such that the sequence (|T ◦ µn|(Ω))n∈N does not converge\r
to |T ◦ µ|(Ω). That is, in contrast with wide convergence and with conver\u0002gence of ranges, the convergence of total variations is not invariant under\r
linear changes of variables.\r
Theorem 3.3. Assume that X is a locally compact separable metric space,\r
and let (µn)n∈N be a sequence of vector measures weakly converging to some\r
vector measure µ. If |·|V is a strictly convex norm on V such that\r
limn→∞|µn|V (X) = |µ|V (X),\r
then the sequence of ranges (rg µn (X))n∈N converges to rg µ (X) in Haus\u0002dorff distance.\r
The proof follows lines of thought from the work of Reshetnyak [16, The\u0002orem 3], Since the approach requires some tools from measure theory, we\r
repeat the proof with explanations on how the tools are used, and we chain\r
the argument with Corollary 3.2 to obtain Hausdorff convergence of the\r
ranges.\r
Proof of Theorem 3.3. For all n ∈ N, let χµn be the indicator measure [16]\r
of |µ|V , defined as the unique measure\r
χµ : B(X × S) → [0, +∞)\r
acting on any continuous function ϕ ∈ C(X × S, R) as\r

Since we are working with vector measures, and because the ranges and\r
the masses remain uniformly bounded for n ∈ N, we may pass to subse\u0002quences and assume without loss of generality that the sequence (χµn\r
)n∈N\r
weakly converges to some measure ρ. As in [16, Theorem 3], we are going to\r
prove that the limit ρ actually equals χµ, the indicator function of |µ|V . To\r
that purpose, we use [16, Theorem 1] to obtain a layerwise decomposition\r
(ω, λ) of the indicator measure ρ [16], in the sense that ω : X → [0, +∞) is\r
a positive measure and λ : X → MB(S)\r

In higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3, there are some norms that do not have\r
a zonal representation. If v = (v1, . . . , vd) ∈ R\r

|v|∞ = max{|v1|, . . . , |vd|}.\r
has no zonal representation of the form Definition 4.1 by any positive mea\u0002sure σ. Indeed, if such measure σ existed, then its dual ball, which is the\r
ℓ\r
1–ball, should be a zonotope. However, the 1–ball is a hyperoctahedron,\r
which has some 2–dimensional that are triangles, and is thus not a zonotope\r
[2, Theorem 3.3].

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 21\r
The above example is not related with the fact that the ℓ\r
1 and ℓ∞ norms\r
are not strictly convex. In fact, there are also strictly convex norms that\r
are do not have a zonal representation Definition 4.1. Indeed, in R\r
3\r
, the\r
p–norm does not have a zonal representation, if p ≥\r
log 3\r
log 3\r
2\r
, and for every\r
p > 2 it is known that the p–norm does not have a zonal representation is\r
the dimension is large enough [2, (32); 23, Proposition 2].\r
Remark 4.3. If σ\r

′\r

In particular, the measure σ satisfying the assumption of Lemma 4.4 is not\r
unique; a canonical representative can be given by requiring sigma to be an\r
even measure supported on the unit sphere of V\r
′\r
.\r
The existence of zonal representation of the norm in V automatically\r
implies a similar representation formula for the mass. It may be seen as\r
an alternative way of representing the mass, without relying on layerwise\r
decompositions.\r
Lemma 4.4 (Representation of the mass). If σ : B(V\r

representation of |·|V , then for every σ–algebra Σ on X, every vector measure\r

|µ|V (X) ≤ |ν|V (X). If the norm is strictly convex, then the inequality is\r
strict. \u0003\r
Relying on the integral and perimeter formulae obtained above, we also\r
propose an alternative proof of Theorem 1.3.\r
We first draw a link between the support of a zonal representation and\r
strict convexity. The above characterization will turn out to be particularly\r
efficient in dimension 2.\r
Definition 4.5. A zonal representation σ : B(V\r
′\r
) → [0, +∞] of a seminorm\r
|·|V is non-degenerate whenever for every non-empty double cone C ⊂ V ,\r
σ(C) > 0.\r
We recall that the set C ⊂ V\r
′\r
is an open cone whenever for every λ ∈\r
R \\ {0} and x ∈, λC = C.\r
In dimension 2, the non-degeneracy of the zonal representation is equiva\u0002lent to strict convexity. This will turn out to be false in higher dimensions.\r
Proposition 4.6. Let V be a finite-dimensional space. Assume that σ is a\r
zonal representation of the seminorm |·|V . The norm |·|V is strictly convex\r
if and only if for every linearly independent vectors v, w ∈ V , there exists\r
η ∈ supp(σ) such that hη, vi and hη, wi do not have the same sign.\r
In particular, if V is a 2-dimensional vector space, then the norm is strictly\r
convex if, and only if, σ is non-degenerate.\r
Proof of Proposition 4.6. We observe that for every η ∈ V\r
′ and v ∈ V , we\r
have\r
\f\r
\fhη, vi + hη, wi\r

with equality if and only if hη, vi and hη, wi have the same sign for every\r
η ∈ supp σ, since the map z ∈ V\r
′\r
7→ hη, zi is continuous.\r
In particular, if σ is a non-degenerate zonal representation, then the norm\r
|·|V is strictly convex. In the two-dimensional case dim V = 2, the sepa\u0002ration condition of Proposition 4.6 on the support conversely implies the\r
density condition on the support. Indeed, for every η ∈ V\r

there exists v, w ∈ V such that if η\r

Density of the support for a zonal representation of a strictly convex norm\r
in higher dimensions dim V ≥ 3 fails in general. As an example, one can\r
consider V = R\r
3 and the measure σ = σx,y + σx,z + σz,y, where σx,y is the\r

By homogeneity, this still holds for every η ∈ V\r

norms in spaces of dimension 2 to approach the problem of mass convergence\r
from a geometric point of view. In particular, we were able to characterize\r
strict convexity of the norm through density of the support for the measure\r
representing the norm.\r
We now give further geometric insight of the problem, by interpreting the\r
total mass of a vector valued measure as the perimeter of its range (up to\r
some multiplicative constant).\r
We first define the perimeter of a polygon in a two-dimensional space.\r
Definition 5.1. If dim V = 2 and P ⊂ V if P is a polygon of vertices\r
v1, . . . , vℓ, we define its perimeter as\r
PerV (P) ,\r
X\r
ℓ\r
i=1\r
|vℓ − vℓ−1|V ,

CONVERGENCE AND MASS OF VECTOR MEASURES 25\r
with the convention that v0 = vℓ.\r
This notion of perimeter is analogous to the notion of perimeter in crys\u0002talline variational problems [9, 11, 22, 24].\r
The perimeter of convex polygons is monotone with respect to set inclu\u0002sion.\r
Lemma 5.2. If dim V = 2 and P1 ⊆ P2 ⊂ V are convex polygons, then\r
PerV (P1) ≤ PerV (P2).\r
Proof. Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that P1 ⊂ H and ∂H contains one\r
side of ∂P1. Then by the triangle inequality for the seminorm PerV (H∩P2) ≤\r
PerV (H). By repeating this process on each edge of the polygon P1, we reach\r
the conclusion. \u0003\r
Lemma 5.2 suggests to extend the definition of perimeter to convex sets\r
as the least upper bound of the perimeter of polygonal subsets.\r
Definition 5.3. If C ⊂ V is convex, we set\r
PerV (C) , sup \bPerV (P) : P ⊆ C is a convex polygono.\r
In view of Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3 coincide for polygons.\r
The monotonicity property of Lemma 5.2 can be transferred to arbitrary\r
subsets and the equality cases can be characterized for strictly convex norms.\r
Proposition 5.4. If C1 ⊆ C2 ⊆ V are compact convex sets, then\r
PerV (C1) ≤ PerV (C2),\r
If |·|V is a strictly convex norm and if equality holds, then C1 = C2.\r
Proof. The inequality follows from Lemma 5.2 and Definition 5.3.\r
For the equality case, we assume by contradiction that C1 ( C2 There\r
exists v ∈ C2 \\C1. Let H ⊂ V be a half-plane such that v 6∈ H and C1 ⊂ H.\r
In particular, for every w1, w2 ∈ C1, we have since |·|V is a strictly convex\r
norm,\r
|w2 − w1|V < |w2 − v|V + |v − w1|V .\r
We define\r
η , inf{|w2 − v|V + |v − w1|V − |w2 − w1|V : w1, w2 ∈ C1}.\r
Since the set C1 is compact and convex, we have η > 0. If P1 ⊆ C1 is a\r
polygon, then the polygon P2 defined as the convex hull of P1 and v satisfies\r
P2 ⊆ C2 and\r
PerV (P2) ≥ PerV (P1) + η.\r
By taking the supremum, it follows from Definition 5.3 that\r
PerV (C2) ≥ PerV (C1) + η > PerV (C1). \u0003\r
