Refractive index data for SIb con and germamum were searched, compiled, \r
and analyzed. Recommended values of refractive index for the transparent \r
spectral region were generated in the ranges 1.2 to 14 }.Lm and 100-750 K for \r
silicon, and 1.9 to 16 pm and 100-550 K foJ' germanium. Generation of these \r
values was based on a dispersion equat.ion which best. fit.s select.ed dat.a sets \r
covering wide temperature and wavelength ranges. Temperat.ure derivat.ive of \r
refractive index was simply calculated from the first derivative of the equation \r
with respect to temperature. The results are in concordance with t.he existing \r
dn/dT dat.a. \r

1. Introduction \r
The refractive index of a material is one of its \r
fundamental and useful optical properties. Accurate \r
knowledge of the refractive index over a wide range of \r
wavelength is indispensable for many applications. \r
Although this property ('.ontinues to l'f'.f'.p.ivp. 1l.ttAnt10n \r
for both industrial as well as purely scientific applica\u0002tions, t.he current state of the availab1e data for certain \r
widely used mater-ials is less than adequate. While \r
experimental results for the refractive ind.ex of pure \r
silicon and germa.nium are reported by several groups \r
of investigators claiming high internal accuracy and \r
agreement, t.he d!tt.ll. ll.<:; n. wholp. 1l.1'p. in disagreement. \r
In this study, an attempt is made to consolidate \r
all of the published refractive index data on silicon \r
and germanium and to critically evaluate the raw \r
experimental data and techniques of observation. A \r
modified Sel1meier type dispersion relation is utilized \r
to describe the available body of data. The resultant. \r

values which agree with the selected experimental \r
data to within ± 2.0 X 10-3 over the wavelength range \r
1.2 to 14.0 .um for silicon and 1.9 to 18.0 !lm for \r
germanium. \r
2. Theoretical Background on Refractive \r
Dispersion in Crystals \r
Dispersion relations are of fundamental importance \r
to the descript,ion of the optical propert,ies of materials. \r
Thev relate both the absorptive and dispersive prop\u0002erti;s into one relatively concise statement describing \r
a o-eneral lineal' relationship between fundament·al b •. . \r
amplit.udes. The only two maJor restnctlOns are \r
boundedness and causality, thus t·hese l'el,HiolJ" ~.re \r
useful in many fields and applications in both phYSICS \r
and eng-ineering-. \r
The ~dispersi~n of radiat.ion in an optical material \r
is' intimately reiated to the microscopic structure of \r
t,he materi~l itself. In t.he most genera,] terms, long \r
wavelength transmission of a pure crystal is limited by \r
molecular vibrations, rotations while short wavelength \r
transmission is limited by the electronic excit.ations of \r
individual atoms. Practically, this implies that the \r
fundamental transpa.rent spectral range may be deter\u0002mined by knowledge of the absorpt.ion spectra of a 

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SiLICON AND GERMANIUM 563 \r
material. The energy necessary for electronic excita\u0002tionsis generally noted by the location {)f the energy \r
gaps whide the molecular excitation is represented by \r
the fundamental phonon frequency. Experimentally, \r
both of these parameters may be altered by various \r
techniques including doping, stress, strain, and tem\u0002perature variations. One other area of primary im-\r
· portance is that of point defects. The varied effects of \r
point defects in semiconducting materials plays an \r
important role in both the eJectrical and opticaJ prop-\r
.erties, however a detailed analysis· of these effects is \r
beyond the scope of this work. A more complete \r
analysis of these effects is given by Crawford and \r
Slifkin [1] . \r
. In general, the absorption and transmission of a \r
material is not well known except for a small wave-\r
·.leligth range. Thus, on .... theotetical grounds, it. is \r
convenient to consider dispersion as arising from two \r
mttj91'SOUrCes separately; namely, the bound and free \r
electrullli. III lion-conducting dielectric n:u;tteriab,. the \r
bound electron. 01' molecular, interactions tend to \r
predomiIHlte, while free electron interactions are most \r
common in metals. In semiconductirig materials, both \r
of these contributions may be important. In fact, most. \r
· semiconductors show an optical absorption and an \r
anomalous dispersion in the far-infrared region. This \r
effect· is I"/j,thtl!" billWllin covalent semiconducton., like \r
Siand Ge,.it increases, however, with increasing polar\u0002ity.Boththeradio-frequency measurement and infra\u0002red observation indicate that the effect of free carriers \r
on Si and Geare negligibly small. Furthermore, in the \r
elemental Siand Ge, the lattice has no permanent \r
dipole moment and consequently the lattice absorption · issmaJl. . \r
For pure dielectrics, the wavelength 01' frequency \r
dependence of the optical constants may be described \r
hy. t.llP. ~1R;:;Rical treatment of Lorentz. The theory \r
assumes the solid to be composed of a series of inde\u0002pendent oscillators, which are set into forced vibrations \r
by the incident radiation. The Lorentz theory of \r
absorption and dispersion for both insulating and \r
semi-conducting mat.erials leads to the two familiar \r
· relations, \r
(1) \r
and \r
(2) \r
where n is the refractive index, K the absorption inel ex, \r
N:1 the parameter associated with the os cill a tor \r
!jtrength of the ~:-th oscillator, ll~ the resonant frequency \r
of the i-th oscillator mid 'Yl the damping constant of the \r
,i-th oscillator. In t.he transparent wa~e]ength region, \r
· eq(l) can be reduced to a Sel1m~ier type equation by \r
neglecting the line width of t.he oscillators, thus \r
reducing t.o: \r
(3) \r
Terms in the first s~ation are contributions from \r
the ultraviolet absorption bands and . those· in the \r
second from the infrared absorption bands. From eq \r
(3), the dielectric constants, E", and E.O, of the material \r
under consideration are defined as: \r
and (4) \r
As noted before, the effects of free carries and lattice \r
absorption are found to be negligibly small in elementai \r
Si and Ge, thus t,he contributions from infrared absorp..; \r
tion bands cnn be dropped and eqs (3) and (4) are \r
simplified t,o; \r
(5) \r
and \r
(6) \r
In an ideal applicntion of eq (5), one would need to· \r
know the wa ve1engths of all of the absorption peakS in \r
the short wfl'Velcll!!th rcgkln. This is very difficult in ... \r
practice because of the large number of absorption \r
peaks. In fllCt., only 1\\ few absorption peaks are nc':' \r
cessible for experimental observation.· It is also \r
observed that nmong the nbsorption peakS, only the \r
one that is located closest to the transparent region has \r
noticeable eHecL OIl the refractive index in the trans~ \r
parent region. In order to simplify t.he calculations \r
of the effect due to unobserved absorption bands and \r
those other thfln the one affecting most the refractive \r
index ill t.lw tmrll5parent region, .the following con\u0002siderations were i,aken. Each term, except the pre\u0002dominuting one, in the summation of eq (5) is' \r
expnnded Il.!:l: \r
(7) \r
Since A/s are usually considerably smaller than A'S in . \r
the t,rllUSpal'ent region, a good approximation of eq \r
(5) is \r
n2=1+ ~ a1 (1+ ~~)+/~~12 (8) \r
or \r
(9) \r
with a, and Al associated with the term that has the \r
greatest effect on the refractive index In the· trans-' \r
parent region. Therefore, we have the simplified dis~ \r
persion equation as: \r

can be generalized to inc1ude temperature as an in\u0002pendent variable. In this case, the parameters t, A, B, \r
and Al are functions of temperature. \r
At long wavelengths, the dielectric constant, E, is \r
equal to the square of refractive index, i.e., E(T)=n2(T) \r

Cardona, raul, and Brooks [3] found the long\u0002wavelength (l/n) (dn/dT) to be (3.9±0.4)X10-5K-I \r
for Si and (6.9::::0A) X 1O-5K-I for Ge, between 77 and \r
400 K. Higher values of (l/n)(dn/T) were observed \r
by other workers: (4.8±0.2)X 1O-5K-I for silicon [4] \r
and 9.7XlO-5K-I for germanium [5]. However, these \r
constant values of (1/n) (dn/ d T) only hold at high \r
temperatures. Devj!L~joB ffUilllilltl!Lri~y u,t, low temper\u0002atures requires that a non-linear relation between \r
E and T be established. The values of the dielectric \r
constant which appea,r in the literature are inaccurate. \r
In the survey work of Young and Frederikse (6), the \r
value for Si varies from 1].7 to ] 2.1 and that of Ge \r
from 13.6 to 16.6. As a consequence, the report,ed \r
values of E are not suitable for eq (10) and E(T) caB \r
only be obtained by fitting selected room-temperature \r
refractive index data to eq (10). The temperature de\u0002pendence of Al was investigated by Macfarlane et at \r
(7, 8], their results are dA;/dT=O.000267 /Jm K-I for \r
Si and 0.001016 11m K-I for Ge at temperatures higher \r
than 200 K. Non-linearity predominates at low \r
temperatures. \r
The parameters, A and B, in eq (10) can be ex\u0002pressed in terms of temperature based on the con\u0002siderations given below. Sinoo \r
!VI \r
A= 2: a;A/ and B=aj (12) i=2 \r
and the a's are respectively proportional to the density \r
of the corresponding oscillator, the temperature de\u0002pendence of ai is given by the relation \r
(13) \r
where 17 and a are respectively the volume and the \r
thermal expansion coefficient of the material. Hence \r
-al T "dT (14) aj=ajOe 293 =a(Oe- 36L (r)/L213, \r
with aO! being the value of aj at 293 K. Furthermore, \r
each of the }./,s in the summa,tion can be considered \r
as a quadratic function of temperature because it is an \r
experimentally observed fact that Ai is approximately \r
a linear function of T (9] in the temperature region of \r
interest. Therefore \r

In the actual cases, however, one finds \\J.egligiblY \r

3. Presentation of Numerical Dat~ \r
Reference data are generated here through \\~ritica] evaluation, analysis, and synthesis of the a~ailable \r
experimental data. The procedure involves \\lritical \r
evaluation of the validity and accuracy of the a~ilable \r
data and information, resolution, and reconc'iation \r
of disagreements in cases of conflicting data, corre\u0002lat.ion of data in terms of various controlling p rame\u0002ters, curve fitting with theoretical or empirical equa\u0002tions, and comparisons of experimental ValUej with \r
predictions. No attempt was made to analyze th thin\u0002film data and the regions of strong absorption, bJ:lause \r
of the scantiness of reliable information. Hojever, \r
experimental data of thin films and absorption ret5ions \r
are also presented along with (,hOlStl of (,he ('rams!-,\\lXent \r

There are a number of experimental methods used \r
for the determinat.ion of refractive index, among which \r
the following a.re those commonly used: \r
DeviatIOn method (prism method) \r
Interference method \r
Trll..nsmission method \r
Reflection method \r
High frequency modulation method \r
Brewster angle method \r
Polarization method \r
Thickness determination method \r
Multilayer method \r
The methods listed above are arranged in the order of \r
their inherent accuracy or popularity. The deviation \r
method is the most popular means of determining the \r
refract.ive indices, but the accuracy of the results \r
depends on t.he conditions of the prism specimen. \r
The highest accuracy that can be attained is in the \r
fifth decima.1 place. The interference technique can be \r
used to obtain data up to the fourth decimal place. \r
Transmission and reflection methods yield results \r
good to the second place, while the multilayer results \r
are no better than two places. For a comprehensive, \r
yet concise, review of all these methods, thf'. TAROf'.T ;" \r
referred to references [10] and [11]. \r
Dispersion equations for Si and Ge have been \r
proposed in earlier works. Available relations a·re dis\u0002cussed in the text so as to facilitate comparison. \r
Refractive indices for most. of selected data sets are \r
report.ed to the fourth decimal place. However, de\u0002ta.iled compositions and cha.racteriza.tions of the \r
specimens were usually not clearly given. Since im\u0002purit.ies in the sample a.nd conditions of t.he surface \r
are decisive fact.ors affect.ing the a.ccuracy of the \r
observed results, such highly precise data cannot be \r
applied to a· sample chosen at. random. For this reason \r
no attempt is made to recommend any particular set \r
of da.ta with the reported hlgh accUlacy, but to g~ll~l'­\r
ate t.he most probable values for the pure crystals. \r
As a result, the estimat.ed uncertainties for the recom\u0002mended values on the refractive index are higher t.han \r
those for the reported data obtained even by high\u0002precision measurements. The accuracy of the recom\u0002mended refractive index values in t.his work is \r
estimated to be 1 to 2 X 10-3 • \r
3.1. Silicon, Si \r
There are 55 sets of experimental data available for \r
the refractive index (wavelength dependence and tem\u0002perature dependence) of silicon as tabulated in tables \r
A-I and A-2 and plotted in figures 1 and 2. It should \r
be pointed out that a few of the data sets are from \r
observations for thin films and are reported here for \r
purposes of comparison. After careful review and eval\u0002uation of the available information, it. was found that. \r
data sets reported by Briggs [12], Sa.1zberg and Villa \r
[13], Cardona et a1. [3], Lukes [4, 14], Primak [15], and \r
Icenogle et a1. [5] are representative for the rflfrfl.l".t.ivA \r
index of silicon in the transparent region between 1.3 \r
and 12 ILm. . \r
Briggs [121 probably was the first one who reported \r
the measured refractive index of silicon. A 1:I\\:1.~% pure \r
silicon wedge specimen of about 11.5° apex angle was \r
investigated using minimum deviation method over a \r
spectral range from 1.05 to 2.60 11m. He stated that \r
the accuracy of his measurements was good to the \r
second decimal place. \r
Since this first measurement, a number of other \r
investigat,ions have been made. RefractIve index det.er\u0002mination from 1.35 to 11.04 11m was made by Salzberg \r

from the Texas Instrument Company. The autocol1i\u0002mat.ion minimum deviation method was used to deter\u0002mine the refractive index. Their result.s were lower \r
than those of Briggs by about 5 parts in tbe third \r
decimal place. They claimed an accuracy of ±2 parts \r
in t.he fourt.h decimal place. \r
Cardona et al. [14] measured t.he refractive index of \r
II thin silicon wedge of 5° in the wavelength range \r
from 1 to 5 ILm and at temperatures 100, 194, and \r
297 K. Theil' results were :lbout 4 parts in the third \r
decimal place lower than the corresponding ones of \r
Briggs. \r
Lukes i4, 14] measured the refract.ive index at five \r
wavelengths, 1.259, 1.407, 1.564, 2.409, and 5.156 I'm, \r
over a wide temperature region bet.ween 109 and 750 l{ \r
by the convent.ional method of minimum deviat.ion. \r
The silicon wedge of ,....., 18° angle was prepared from \r
fl p-type single cryst.al wit.h a resist.ivity of ,....., 380 \r
ohm-cm. The report.ed eITor was ± "-"'0.0004, but his \r
values of refract.ive index were systematically lower \r
t.han t.hose of Salzberg and Villa by 0.0015. \r
Primak [15] went to great lengt.hs in the det.ermina\u0002tion of the refractive index of silicon from 1.12 to 2.16 \r
)..Lm. His results corresponded closely to those report.ed \r
by Lukes. As he t.ook into account. all of t.he influencing \r
fact.ors in arriving at the final values, he believed that \r
his va.]ues were reliable wit.hin an uncert.ainty of 1 or \r
2 pa.rts in the third decimal pJa.ce. \r
Icenogle et a1. [15] made a thorough investigation on \r
the refract.ive index for silicon over the temperature \r
and wavelength ranges of 99-296 K and 2.554-10.27 \r
ILm, respect.ively. The samples ,vere obtained from the \r
Exotic Materials, Inc. and were charact.erized as \r
"good optical grade" without further details of purity \r
of the material. The results are in fair agreement with \r
other dat.a sets. The claimed errors were ± 3 X 10-4\r

For the purpose of ease of comparison, the above \r
mentioned data sets are replotted in figure 3. It is \r
obvious tha.t the disagreement, nmong the values \r
reported by different researchers is greater than the \r
accuracy claimed by them. Although internal consist\u0002ency was observed in each investigtttibn, unaccounted \r
sources of errors are responsible for these discrepancies. \r
Primak [151 devoted considerable space to the dis\u0002cussion of both systematic and random ern)rs with the \r
conclusion that the systematic errors played the key \r
role in data discord. The possible sources of error were \r
attributed to: \r
i. Inadequate care in checlring the pyramidal error. \r
If the wedge angle was not perpendicular to the circle \r
and parallel to the telescope, the effective angle would \r
be greater than the true wedge angle with the conse\u0002quence of a larger deviation angle which would 'lead \r
to a larger value of refractive inde);. \r
ii. Small wedge angle of the samples. For a highly \r
refracting material such as silicon, a small wedge \r
angle is required to measure the refractive index. As \r
a result, large errors in angle measurement can be \r
introduced and hence in the observed refractive index. \r
iii. Broad detector used. Observation in the infrared \r
requires a detector in the determination of deviation \r
angle. The detectors that have been used are in general \r
many times broader than the width of the spect.ral \r
line, thus decreasing the accuracy in reading the \r
angles. Significant errors are, therefore, inevitably \r
introduced. \r
iv. Optical inhomogeneity of the sample. Optica.l \r
inhomogeneity of the material causes image distortion \r
ItllU ~Lu,,; LIJt:l tUTO]' iu ~he lhllgh: :;ettiug. \r
Among the above sources, t.he smaDness of the wedge \r
angle is the major factor that contributes to t.he error. \r
A combination of these contributions limits the a.c\u0002cura.cy of the measurement of the rehactive jndex by \r
the minimum deviation method to 1 or 2 units in t.he \r
third decimal place, a few t,imes higher than that \r
claimed by most investigators. \r
The effect of impurities on the refractive index is \r
considerable. In some cases, observations made on \r
samples of questionable origin and undefined purity \r
may yield radically different results. Villa !Hi) re\u0002ported his grossly divergent values (shown in figure 3) \r
to show that samp)e differences can be very slgnlncant. \r
In figure lone can see Simon's [1711'adically different \r
results obtained for a silicon sample of high impurity \r
content. The data of Spitzer et a.l. [18], obtained on \r
heavily doped silicon, are significantly divergent from \r
~ho::;e of jJUHj !:;/l,ll1jJl~~. Thus, when the effects (If im\u0002purjtjes are taken into consideration, discrepancies \r
from pure samples may be much larger t.han 2 parts \r
in the third decimal place. \r
Although the factors discussed above are well \r
known, unfortunately they are generally not cited \r
in literature, but must be deduced from the assigned \r
accuracies. III the pre5ent work it is a:55umed that \r
data sets that are discordant only in the third decimal \r
J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 9, No.3, 1980 \r
. place are in reasonabJe agreement. This assumption \r
can be supported by a careiul comparison of the ob\u0002servations by Icenogle et a1. (51 in which the va1ues of \r
the refractive index at a given wave]engtb and tem\u0002perature, obtained from wavelength-dependence ob-\r
,ervation and from temperature-dependence observa\u0002jon, can be difterent in many cases by more than \r
I, part in the third decimal, few times higher than the \r
11aimed precision of ±3Xlfr\\ \r
More data can be found in references [19-30] and \r
He given in tables A-I and A-2, in which one can find \r
also data sets obtalned on tbin films. No attempt was \r
made t.o analyze the t.hin film data.. However, it has \r
b ~en observed that the refractive indices of pure silicon \r
tl.in films tend to agree ¥rith those of bulk crystal if \r
tl e films are deposited on substrates maintained at \r
el'lvated temperatures during deposition or appro\u0002priately annealed after deposition. Surface contamina\u0002tic n appears to be the most serious problem. However, \r
da ~a for thin films reported by those who exercise ap\u0002pn 'priate precautions in the sample preparation are \r
uSI.ally in agreement with those of bulk material. \r
l,iterature data on the temperature coefficient of the \r
refl active index is rather scarce. Data reported in \r
tab.88 A-3 and A-4 and plotted in figures 4 and 5 are \r
tho::e of Lukes [4, 14J. His values were evaluated from \r
his :neasurements given in table A-2 aud in figure 2. \r
A though a significant body of data on the refractive \r
inde\\. of silicon is available, an attempt to analyze \r
data has been rare. In the literature, only one quantita\u0002tive study has been proposed. Hertzberger and Salz\u0002berg [31J proposed a dispersion equation for silicon \r
WhlCl L was derived in conjunction with 13 other \r
mate·ials. They not.ed that it comparison of t.he data \r
from 14 :roaterials indicated that aB had refractive \r
index values varying asymptotically with ),.2. Further\u0002more, the mean asynrptote was found to be at 1.0= \r
0.168 urn. The dispersion relation was based upon Ii \r

In the present work, eq (10) is used to represent the \r
refractivd index for silicon. The main task was the \r
selection of the appropriate parameters E and }..i, and \r
the deter.nination of the coefficients A and B. But the \r
most imp )rtant of all was the selection of reliable data \r

valuet; had tu be read off from the graphs in their \r
reports. Deviations between the graph readings and \r
the true values can occur in the second decimal place of \r
the data. The data of Briggs were not chosen as his \r
values disagree in the second decimal place with the cor\u0002responding values of Primak who exercised great care \r
in the experiment for high purity silicon specimens. \r
The remaining data :;eLt; f!"Om Primak, SalzbeTa Ilnd \r
Villa, and Icenogle et a1. constitute the bnsis ;f ou)" \r
recommendations. Their results are in a,areement in \r
the third decimal as expected. Fortunatel;, Icenogle's \r
work covered a sizable temperature range, t.hus per\u0002mitting the prediction of the refraction index at \r
temperatures other than room temperature. \r
Selection of f and A1 in eq (10) was rather difficult. \r
Figure 6 shows the results of Cardona, et a1. [3] who \r
observed the relative changes of refractive index, \r
Anln. at a wavelength of 3 .urn as tempp.T'll.t.nl'P. vnript\\ \r
between 77 to 400 K. The average slope, (lIn) (dnldT) , \r
of this curve is (3;9±0.4)X 10-sK-l. Lukes [4,14] ob\u0002tained a higher value of 4.8±0.2XIO-5\r
K-l for \r
(lin) (dnjdT) by ex('rapulating his results to longer \r
wavelengths. It appeared that at long wavelengt:hs, \r
f in eq (10) could be determined from the relnt.ion \r
(ljf) (dEjdT) = (2jn) (dnjdT) using one of the above \r
mentioned (ljn) (dnjdT) values. The result should be \r
an exponential relation of the form f=EoeCT• However, \r
es the constancy of (lIn) (dn/dT) does not hold for the \r
'tvide termperl1ture range of our interest, all tllllpirical \r
relation between E and T had to be found based on Oil' \r
experimental data on n. \r
I t. is shown in figure 2 that curves of temperature \r
dependence of refractive index at. various wavelengt,hs \r
are essentially parallel to each other and that. eacll of \r
them smoothly and monotonically increases wit.h \r
temperature. This provides the possibilit.y to find \r
relations between t and T. Since E is nearly equal 1,0 71.2 \r
at long wavelengths, the best choice in the present cnse \r
seemed to be the refractive indices at 10.27 J.Lm bv \r
Icenogle et al. [5]. As the available data of neT) at 10.2i \r
j.Lm cover only the limited temperature ranO'e from . 0 \r
100 to 298 K, a WIder temperat.ure range coverage is \r
needed to establish the relation between t and T elm!, \r
is valid over the temperature range 100-750 K. As \r
shown in figure 2, the 5.156 j.Lm curve by Lukes [14] is \r
slightly above, but. parallel to, the extension ma(le \r
from the 10.17 101m curve. The required 10.27 p'm dnj,n \r
in the high temperature region can be estimated by an \r
appropriate extrapolation of Icenogle'S data within \r
that region. III (,hit; way, the following polynomial \r
expression is found to be valid at 10.27 /.1m ond aver \r
100-750 K temperature range, \r
n2(10.27 p'm, T) =11.4552+2.7765 X 10-4T+ L 7066 \r
X 1O-6T2- 8.1423 X lO-IOT3. (20) \r
Since at' long wavelengths the dielectric constant \r
closely approaches 71.2, it is acceptable to consider the \r
above quantity as a proportional factor and thus \r
express the dielectric constant by the relation \r
(21) \r
where E is the proportional constant. \r
The spectral positions of resonant absorption peaks \r
have been observed by a number of investigators. Moss \r
132) made an attempt to cakulaLe the refractive indices \r
in the transparent region from the absorption data \r
based on the general principle of oscillatory' syst,em. \r
~he spect!al position of the natural frequency in hii'l \r
i'llDgle OSCIllator model was determined at 3.4 eV or \r
1-=0.365 p.m. McLean [2] investigated the absorption \r
edge spectrum of silicon and found the optical energy \r
gap a,t 300 K to be E g=l.12 eV or AI=1.1071 /-1m. \r
Macfarlane et al. [7J further studied the absorption \r
edge spectrum and found that the temperature varia\u0002t,ion of the optical energy gap is essentially' linear in \r
the temperature region 250-480 K, but nonlinearity \r
progressively predominates at lower temperat,ures, as \r
seen from figure 7. Lukes and Schmidt [91 studied the \r
I'I?fledivity spectrum of oi11con aDd found two adJi\u0002tiona! absorption peaks at about 0.36 and 0.27 /Lm. \r
The first one is in line with the Moss' [32J result, while \r
the second corresponds to the prediction of Y u and \r
CnrdODn, [33]. A summary of these findings results in \r
t.hrcc absorption peaks; namely: AI=1.1071 JLm, \r
1-2=O.~65. JLm, and A8=0.27 JLm, that supposedly \r
llilvc slgmficl'l.nt. ",fl'l'ets OD the refractive iDdex iD the \r
tr:mspnrent region from 1.2 to ]4 /-1m. \r
An attempt was made to fit the selected data to an \r
eq1l:1.1,ioD similar to eq (10) by including extra t.erms \r
due {,o 1-2 lInd A3' It was found, however, that the in\u0002t.roduct.ion of the A2 aand A3 terms did not improve the \r
1ll!l'eement obtained when only the AI term was in\u0002clllded. Furthermore, the coefficients of the A2 and As \r
terms eould not be uniquely defined because t,here \r
were no reliable data in the regions bounded by Ilnd \r
!lenr t.he thrflp. pp.A.k wllvelengths. Also, the valuc of B \r
\\Vas found to be negligibly sma!l, thus making the \r
(;ontTibution of the last term in eq (10) insignificant. \r
As :l consequence, eq (18) was adopted and -the len.st, \r
"qua.res fitting of selected data to this equation yielded \r
t.he following expression for the refractive index of \r
silicon in the ranges 1.2 to]4 jJ.n1 ano 100-750 K. \r

It should be pointed out that the room-tempern.ture \r
dielectric constant for silicon can be calculated from \r
the expression for E in eq (22). The result is 11.66 \r
which agrees well with the commonly accepted value \r
of 11.7. \r

uncertainties of ± 2 X 10-3\r
• The recommended values \r
are given in table 1 and plotted in figure S. To provide \r
visual comparison of calculated values with the experi\u0002mental data, calculated values at a few specified tem\u0002peratures and wavelengths are plot.t.ed in figures 2 and \r

data on which eq (22) is based. Icenogle et ai. eval\u0002uated I1nll1T values using their own measurements of \r

is reasonable to adopt the arne experimental eITor bar \r
since the n versus T cur res in figure 2 are closely \r

SinGe Briggs' observati~n, several ot.her independent \r

mensured and t.hey found i hat there were no signiJ\u0002iennt differences between '~he result" obt,nined for \r

Cardona et al. [3] measured the refractive index \r
for a thin 2:ermal1iuDl wed!!o of 5° in t.he wavelength \r

[40] are higher. Such discre:t'ancies were attributed \r
to ~~e inho~ogeneitjes and- impurities in the samples \r
whICh effectIvely reduced the thickness of the ca\u0002pacitors and t.hus resulted in an apparent increase in \r
t.he dielectric constant. \r
Rank et aI. [35J meo..sured the refractive index over \r
it wavelength region between 2.0 and 2.4 ,!Lm by an \r
interferometric method. A single crystal ge.rmrmium of \r
unspecified purity wo..s used and t.he result.ing 11.'8 were \r
about. 0.01 higher than the corresponding values of \r
Briggs. The tempemture variation of the refractive \r
index was observed to have, a positive coefficient and \r
the absorption edge moved to longer wavelengths as \r
t.emperature increased. \r
Lukes 136, 37] meo..sured the refract.ive index for \r
several germanium prism samples cut from single \r
crystals of varying impurity. His measurements were \r
carried out over a wavelength range of 1.8-5.5 p.ro \r
and the temperature range 100-530 K. 'The results \r
obtained for the purest sample were in agreement with \r
those of Salzberg and Villn, while the results for the \r
impure samples showed discrepancies at the long \r
wflyolengthc, the higher the impurit,y, the lower the \r
n. In the shorter wavelength region, <4 ).tm, the \r
refmctive index appeared pract.ically independent on \r
the impurity content. \r
IcenogJe et a1. [5] made n t.horough investigation \r
on the refractive index for germanium over the 95-297 \r
K and 2.554-12.360 ).tm regions. 'The samples were \r
obtained from t.he Exotic Material, Inc. and were \r
characterized as "good opt.ical grade" without further \r
JetaHs of purity of the material. The daimed error \r
in t.he meai'urement of n was + 6 X 10-4• The results \r
disl1,gree with those of other workers by several part.s \r
in the third decimn.1. At. room t.emperature and in the \r
wavelength region where >">3 .urn, Icenogle'S values are \r
l1igher t.haD the earlier works. The sources for such \r
cii"c.repnnc.ies can possibly be ascribed to differences in \r
the impurity content of the samples. \r
Edwin et a1. [38] made careful measurements of n \r
for ,yell chnracterized germanium specimens in the \r
spectml region 8-14 ).tm. Their results nrc in agreement. \r
with Icenogle'S values when account i" taken of both \r

temperat.ure readings, angle determination,,;, wave\u0002length identification, -curvature of "lit. image, nnd \r

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SILICON AND GERMANIUM 583 \r
True internal consistency was observed in each \r
measurement, unaccounted sources or errors were re\u0002sponsible for the discrepancies. \r
Primak [15] devoted considerable space to dis\u0002cussions of both systematic and random errors for \r
the O(!'SG of silioon (see subsection 3.1). The eonc1usjon,; \r
are generally valid for other materials. Among the \r
possible sources, the smallness of the prism angle is \r
the major factor that contributes to the error. \r
Combined with the errors fr om other sources, the \r
limit of accuracy in the measurement of n by the \r
minimum deviation method is 1 to 2 parts in the \r
third decimal pI !1CC , n, few times higher than thni \r
claimed by many workers. \r
The effect of impurities on the refractive index j~ \r
considerable. In some cases, observations made on \r
samples of questionable origin and undefined purity \r
may yield ra,dically different results; Simon [17] re\u0002ported his radically different results (shown in figure \r
11) obtained for a germanium sample of high impurity \r
content. Spitzer et al. [44] investigated the opt,ieni \r
constants of heavily doped germanium with res1111,,",, \r
greatly different from those of pure samples shown in \r
figure 11. Thus, "Then the effects of impuritie~ arC' \r
taken into consideration, discrepancies from pure \r
samples may be much higher than 2 parts in t.he third \r
decimal place. \r
Although the error causing factors given abovl' n.)'(~ \r
well known, unfortunately they are not genern.}]y \r
given in the literat.urp. A,nit 9..ut.h01's fl.itvAnCf\\ initppend\u0002ent claims of their own precisions. In the present, work \r
it is assumed that data sets are concordant if they flrP \r
not identical in the third decimal place. \r
More data, can be found in references [4]-58] 11m] \r
are given in tables A-5 and A-6, in which one c[m fl,lso \r
find data sets obtained for thin films. No a.ttempl ,,·ns \r
made to analyze the thin film data. However, it hn~ \r
been observed that the refractive indices of pure \r
germanium thin films tend to agree with those of blllk \r
crystal if the films are deposited on substrates l11nin\u0002tamed at elevated temperatures during the COllr:':(l of \r
deposition or appropriately annealed after deposition. \r
Surface contamination appears to be the most ~eri()lI'; \r
problem. However, data for thin films reporte,j hy \r
those who exercised precaution in sample prepnTlll iOll \r
are usually in agreement with those for bulk mn.i.erinl. \r
Literature it!l.tfi on the t.emper!1.ture derivntiv(' of \r
the refractive index of germanium is rather sean'e. \r
The data tabulated in tables A-7 and A-8 and ploltl'd \r
in figures 14 and 15 are mainly those of Ll1ke:-; 1%, \r
58, 59]. His dnjdT values were evaluated from hj~ \r
measurements of n given in table A-6 and fig·me ] 2. \r
Although considerable amounts of experimental \r
data on the refractive index of germanium are avail\u0002able, they have received little analysis. The earliest \r
quantitative results for germanium are generally at\u0002tributed to Brattain and Briggs [41]. 'VhiJe they \r
presented no dispersion relations in their work, they \r
noted that their results were extremely sensitive to \r
specimen preparation and that large discrepancies \r
arose between samples. \r
The first qualitative attempt was made by Rank \r
et 8]. lab), who fitted tl Ca,ucny type dispersion reJation \r
of t.he. form \r
{25) \r
where \\ is in units of Mm. They presented results for \r
fits on both their own data and for the Brattain and \r
Briggs data with the following consta.nts: \r

a, Mm2 \r
0.21345 \r
0.44647 \r
b, Mm2 \r
0.5363 \r
0.6882 \r
While this relation represented well each of the da,ta \r
sets, the aut.hors found discrepancy between the two \r
data, sets as indicated bv the coefficients. \r
The next dispersion rclation was advanced by Hertz\u0002herger and Salzberg [31] which they developed using \r
datIL for n materials in addition to germanium. They \r
nol,ed U)a,t comparisons of the data for 14 different \r
mat.erials indicated that all had refractive indices \r
varying asymptotically with \\2. They found t.he mean \r
:lsymp1,o1,e of all t.he mH,terials in thp, lTV l'eeion t.o he \r
:11 Ao=0.J68 Mm. Their dispersion relation is based \r
Ilpon II Ta.ylor expansion in A2 which retains only the \r
linen1' t.erms. The form is \r
where A is in units of Mm, L=I/(\\2- AQ2), and the \r
eoeffleients for the region 2.0 to 13.5 Ilm are: \r
.1=3.99931, \r
13=0.391707, \r
('=0.163492, \r
D= -0.0000060, \r
E~ 0.000000053. \r
These results agree very wen with the data from which \r
they nre derived. \r
In tIle present work, eq (10) was used t.o represent \r
t.he refractive index of germanium. The main tilsk was \r
the ,;election of the reliable data sets, t.he npproprillte \r
pnrameters ~ ilnd AJ, nnd the determination of the \r
coefflcients A and B. The data reported by Cardona et \r
n1. and Luke" were not used on the grounds that. their \r
vnllles in our collf'ction were read from the gTaphs in \r
their paper,;. 'Ye have found that deviat.ions between \r
the graph readings and the true vn1ues were quite \r
large, estimat,ed at 1 to 2 percent.. Values reported by \r

air values) appear to be relatively t.oo ,high compared \r
with those of' Brigg,; :lIld Salzberg and Villa in tile \r
corresponding wavelengt.h region, 2.0-2.4 MIn. \r
Alt.hough germanium has long been an important \r
infrared mat.erial, it.s refrnctive index in the long \r
wavelength region has not been wen defined. Results \r
from different. workers often differ by as much as 0.003. \r

Sueh a la~ ~e discrepancy cannot be accounted for by \r
merely cx~,erimental errors. Unknown impurities in \r
some of t~~ samples are probably responsible for the \r
differences'l However, this very important information \r
is generallYi missing from the papers. As a result, the \r
current kno'l vledge of the refractive index of germanium \r
still remain~ uncertain. Results of Edwin et a1. [38] a.nd \r
Icenogle et \\. 11. [5] are uniformly higher than those of \r
Salzberg an . Vi1lH [13] in the long wavelength region. \r
Spitzer and 'an [44) observed that the refractive index \r
of an imPU~l sample in the long wavelength region \r
is lower tharl that of a purer specimen. According to \r
t,h;~, it, w0'l11J. seem t.hllt. S!llzberg and Villa, had more \r
impurities iul their specimen than did Edwin and \r
Icenogle. Thi! is not the case, however, as the above \r
mentioned da\\a sets are essentially parallel in the long \r
wavelength rlgion while Spitzer and Fan's results \r
indicate a pr6,~ressively decreasing n with increasing \r
wavelength (s\\ e figures 1 and 11). Based on t.his con\u0002sideration, the seleetod d (.til scts were given equal \r
weight. Fort.uD,ately, data by Icenogle et al. cover a \r
sizable tempert ture range, permitting the prediction I of n at temperatures other than room temperature. \r
Selection of \\: and A] presented some difficulties. \r
Cardona et al. \\ [3] observed the relative changes of \r
refractive indexi: t::.n/n, at a wavelength of 3 }.1m as \r
tempera, L UHl vl:Li,ied from 77 to 400 K with results \r
plotted in figure; 16. The average slope, (1 In) (dn/dT) \r
of this plot is :!,'6.9±OA) X 10-5K-1. Icenogle et 0.1. \r
obtained a highlllr value, of 9.9Xl0-5I{-] for (ljn) \r
(dn/dT) in the 'yavelength range 2.5M to ]2.] }.1m. \r
It appeared thai d in eq (0) could be determined from \r
the relation (lit) (~~e/dT) = (2/n) (dn/dT) using the value \r
01' (lin) (dn/dT) at long wavelengths. The result would \r
be an exponential';relation of the form E=EoetT• How\u0002ever, the constanc:r of (l/n)(dn/dT) does not hold for \r
a wide temperl'l.t.m P. rll.ne'!>., B ",nee, Rn empirical reI ... -\r

It is shown in figure 12 that curves of temperature \r
dependence of refra;\\tive index at various wavelengths \r
are essentially parallel to each other and that each of \r
them smoothly nn.1 monotonically increases with \r
temperature. This provides a possibility to find n \r
relation between E ll.n.d T. As E closely equals n2 nt long \r
wavelengths, the bes\\: choice in the present case is th~ \r
refractive indices at 10.27 }.1m by Icenogle et al. 15J. \r
However, their result!: cover only a temperature range \r
from 100 to 298 K . .A wider temperat.ure coverage is \r
required to establl::;ll L !'eIa.tion between E and T that \r
is reliable over the te:nperature region 100-550 K of \r
genera] interest. As sh:>wn in figure 12, the 5.156 }.1m \r
curve of Lukes [36) is slightly above and parallel to \r
the extension made fDm the 10.27 J.Lill curve. The \r
needed refractive indices at 10.27 }.1m in the higher \r
temperature region w~ therefore obtained by appro\u0002priate extrapolation of ::cenogle's data in that' region. \r
J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 9, No.3, 1980 \r
In this way, the following polynomial equation is \r
found to be valid 'at lO.27 j.!lll and over 100-550 K: \r
n2(10.27 ~m, T)=15.3122+ 1.4571 X 1O- 3T \r
+3.5131 X 1O-6T2-1.2089X 1O-9T3. (27) \r
Since at long wavelengths the dielectric constant \r
closely approaches but does not exactly equal n2, it \r
is therefore appropriate to consider the above quan\u0002tit,y JlS fl. proportional factor o,nd the dielectric constaut, \r
is expressed as: \r
E(T)=En2(10.27 .um , T), \r
where E is the proportional constant. \r
Spectral positions of natural absorption peaks in \r
germanium have been studied by a number of inves\u0002tigators. McLean [2] investigated the absorption edge \r
spectrum of germanium and found the optical energy \r
gap at 300 K to be Eg=0.663 eV or A1=1.8703 }.1m. \r
l\\1n.cfnrlilne et al. [8] further ::;Luuieu the absorption \r
edge spectrum and found the temperature variation \r
of the optical energy gap is essentially linear in t.he \r
. temperature range 200-300 K, but nonlinearit,y pro\u0002gressively predominates at lower temperatures as \r
shown in figure 17. Lukes and Schmidt [9] studied the \r
reflectivity spectrum of germanium and found two \r
Il.dditiona.1 absorption pea.ks at A2~ 0.589 }.1m and \r
As' .... ' 0.282 J,.!m. The latter corresponds to that predicted \r
by Yu and Cardona [33]. As a summary of these \r
findings, one now has three absorption peaks; namely: \r
A] = 1.8703 }.1m, V'" 0.589 }.1m, and As' .... , 0.282 }.lID that \r
are supposed to have significant effects on the refrac\u0002tive index in the transparent region, i.9-16 }.lID. \r
In thi:::. wurk, Lhe selected data, were fitted to an \r
equation similar to eq (10) by including extra terms \r
due to A2 and A8. It was found, however, that i.ntro\u0002duction of the A9 and A, terms did not improve t.he \r
agreement obtained when only the Al term was in\u0002cluded. Furthermore, the coefficients of the A2 and Aa \r
terms could not be uniquely defined because there \r
were no reliable data in the regions bounded by and \r
near the three peak wavelengths. Also, the value of B \r
was found to be negligibly low and hence the contri\u0002bution of the last term in eq (10) was insignificant. As \r
;l consequence, eq (18) was adopted and the least \r
squa.res fitting of selected data to this equation yielded \r
the following expression for the refractive index of ger\u0002manium in the ranges of l.~ to H\\ }.1m and 100-550 K: \r
where \r

It is interesting to point out that the room tempera\u0002ture dielectric constant for germanium can now be \r
calculated from the expression of E in eq (28). The \r
result is 16.009 which is in good agreement with the \r
commonly accepted value of 16.0. \r
Equation (28) was used to calculate the recom\u0002mended values of the refractive index of germanium \r
with uncertainties of ±2XlO-s. The recommended \r
values are given in table 4 and plotted in figure 18. \r
To provide a visual comparision of the calculated \r
values with experimental data, calculated values at \r
a few specifieu temperatures and wavelength~ aTe \r
plotted in figures 12 and 13 where close agreement \r
is revealed. Tables 5 and 6, respectively, give the \r
calculated dn/dT and dn/dX values based on the first \r
derivatives of eq (28) with respect to T and X. The \r
corresponding plots are shown in figures 19 Ilnd 20. \r
Uncertainties in the calculated dn/dT values are \r
estiwa,Led lmsed Uil Iceilugle't; daLa [liJ w 11ich are \r
essentially the basis for eq (28). Icenogle et al. eval\u0002uated An/I1T values using their own measurements \r
of n and found the average uncertainty in An/AT \r
to be about ± 0.5 X 1O-4K-1. Error bars corresponding \r
to this amount are drawn on the calculated curves \r
in figures 11 (l,Dd 15 where calculated results are \r
compared with experimental data. Although ac\u0002curacies of experimental dn/dT are not available in \r
Lukes' work [36, 38, 59], it is reasonable to use the \r
same error bar as the experimental errors because \r
the n versus T curves in figure 12 are closely parallel. \r
Uncertaint.ies in the calculated dn/dX are estimated \r
from the expression: \r
o(du/dX)~±2on/X, \r
as discussed in subsection 3.1. Similar to the case of \r
silicon, the uncertainties in dn/dX of germanium are \r
about ±5XlO-4\r
J,Lm- 1 at 2.55 J,Lm, 1.2XlO-4J,Lm-1 at \r
10 .um, and 0.7X10-4.um-1 at 18 J,Lm. \r
It should be noted that calculated values in tables \r
4, 5, and 6 are given with more digits than warranted \r
for the purpose of tabular smoothness. \r
As these values are calculated from an equa.tiQD, it \r
is desirable to give enough digits to show the variation \r
of the variables in the equation and to provide com\u0002parasion among neighboring entries. To identify the \r
unwarranted insignificant digits in the values, an \r
overstrike is used. Appropriate uncertainties in the \r
recommended values are discussed in the text and \r

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SILICON AND GERMANIUM 599 \r
4. Conclusions and Recommendations \r
Experimental data on the refractive index of cry~tal\u0002line silicon and germanium and its temperature denva\u0002tive were exhaustively surveyed and reviewed. Values \r
of physical properties wbich are related to the dispel" \r
sion equation were selected from the open literature. \r
In addition, a. number of thin film data sets were also \r
(~ompilec1. \r
The purpose of the present work was to survey and \r
compile the available data and to generate recom\u0002mended values of the refractive index and its tem\u0002perature derivatIve for crystalline siliconanu ger\u0002manium. Recommended values for these ma.terials \r
were generated based on currently availa.ble data. \r
Since the state of the refractive index of eit.her of the \r
crystals have not been well defined, our recommenda\u0002tions should be considered at best representing average \r
values of the selected data sets. Many factors are \r
known to influence the accuracy of the refractive index \r
of a crystal. Although the minimum deviation method \r
is known to be the most accurate way to determine the \r
refraotive index, this is not. t.me in t.he case of silicon \r
and germanium. Being highly refractive, the prism \r
specimens used must be thin, usually about 15° apex \r
angle or sometimes lower, thus giving rise to relative)?' \r
higher uncertaintIes. Utherpossible sources of expen\u0002menta,} errors were discussed by Primak (15]. However, \r
the most important factor which contributes to the \r
total error is the impurit.y cont.pnt. of the specimen. \r
Although tills is a well known source of error, unfor\u0002tunately, this very important piece of information is \r
usually not reported. As a. consequence, discrepancies \r
among the currently available data cannot be reason\u0002ably resolved. \r
Unless one is sa.tisfied with the existing· data having \r
uncertainties of a few parts in the third decimal place, \r
serious considerations should be given to obtaining \r
data reliable in the fourth or fifth decimal place. A \r
systematic Ineasurement program on the refra.ci-ive \r
index should be carried out with the folJowmg con\u0002siderations: \r
1. Experimental method. Because the minimum \r
uevittLivll method does not yield high u.ocuru.cy in th(, \r
case of 8i and Ge, it is strongly felt that the int('r\u0002ference method should be used. In this met.hod, t.lll' \r
determination of interference order plays t.he decisive \r
role in the accuracy of the results. In order t.o obt,Hill \r
high accuracy, thick plate specimens should be us('( I. \r
2. Sample characterization. As the impurity content \r
of the sample strongly affect the refractive index, t.he \r
impurities in the sample should be ascertained and \r
reported. Merely reporting the eJectricaJ resistivi ty of \r
the sample is not adequate. The nature and amount of \r
impurities should specifically be reported. In order to \r
see the effects of impurities on the refractive index, \r
measurement should be carried out for a group of \r
specimens with systematical1y controlled impuri~ies. \r
3. Environm!lntal control. Since both silicon and \r
germanium have high temperature coefficients of \r
refractive index (in the order of 1O-4K-l), the tem\u0002perature of the sample has to be carefully controlled \r
in order to achieve the required accuracy. Pressure has \r
little effect on the refractive index under ordinary \r
conditions. The pressure coefficient of the refractive \r
index of Ge at 297 K is (l/n)(dnjdP \r
=-7±2XIO-7kg- 1cm2 [3]. That of 8i is -3±2 \r
Xl 0-7kg-1cm2 [3]. \r
In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the \r
present work does not resolve the discrepancies \r
between the available data sets, it simply recommends \r
the most pro bale values of the refractive index that a \r
pure crystal of 8i and Ge may have with the quoted \r
uncertainties. Also, it should be noted that, as in any \r
statistical study of this type, the dispersion equations, \r
eqs (22) and (28), are valid to the reported accuracy \r
only within the region of experimental data. In general, \r
ex1.mpo!n,tion of these equations for use outside of this \r
region is invalid for quantitative results. Fina.lly, t.he \r
type of analysis presented here assumes the data t.o be \r
:111 n.bsolutely correct representation of the model at. \r
hn.))d, which is not generally true since the model is un \r
oversimplification of the true dispersion relation. \r
However, for predictive purposes, based upon the \r
experimental data from several authors, and within \r
t,he lIsnble region of the data, we believe that these \r
efjll:l.t.ions are valid for calculation of the refract.ive \r
index in the given wavelength and tempera.ture \r
regions. \r

Center for Information and Numerical Data Analysis and Synthesis, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47908 \r
Refractive index data for SIb con and germamum were searched, compiled, \r
and analyzed. Recommended values of refractive index for the transparent \r
spectral region were generated in the ranges 1.2 to 14 }.Lm and 100-750 K for \r
silicon, and 1.9 to 16 pm and 100-550 K foJ' germanium. Generation of these \r
values was based on a dispersion equat.ion which best. fit.s select.ed dat.a sets \r
covering wide temperature and wavelength ranges. Temperat.ure derivat.ive of \r
refractive index was simply calculated from the first derivative of the equation \r
with respect to temperature. The results are in concordance with t.he existing \r
dn/dT dat.a. \r
Key words: Germanium; optical constants: refractive index: silicon: temperature coefficient \r
of refractive index. \r

the following a.re those commonly used: \r

Interference method \r
Trll..nsmission method \r
Reflection method \r
High frequency modulation method \r
Brewster angle method \r
Polarization method \r
Thickness determination method \r
Multilayer method \r
The methods listed above are arranged in the order of \r
their inherent accuracy or popularity. The deviation \r
method is the most popular means of determining the \r
refract.ive indices, but the accuracy of the results \r
depends on t.he conditions of the prism specimen. \r
The highest accuracy that can be attained is in the \r
fifth decima.1 place. The interference technique can be \r
used to obtain data up to the fourth decimal place. \r
Transmission and reflection methods yield results \r
good to the second place, while the multilayer results \r
are no better than two places. For a comprehensive, \r
yet concise, review of all these methods, thf'. TAROf'.T ;" \r
referred to references [10] and [11]. \r
Dispersion equations for Si and Ge have been \r
proposed in earlier works. Available relations a·re dis\u0002cussed in the text so as to facilitate comparison. \r
Refractive indices for most. of selected data sets are \r
report.ed to the fourth decimal place. However, de\u0002ta.iled compositions and cha.racteriza.tions of the \r
specimens were usually not clearly given. Since im\u0002purit.ies in the sample a.nd conditions of t.he surface \r

For the purpose of ease of comparison, the above \r
mentioned data sets are replotted in figure 3. It is \r
obvious tha.t the disagreement, nmong the values \r
reported by different researchers is greater than the \r
accuracy claimed by them. Although internal consist\u0002ency was observed in each investigtttibn, unaccounted \r
sources of errors are responsible for these discrepancies. \r
Primak [151 devoted considerable space to the dis\u0002cussion of both systematic and random ern)rs with the \r
conclusion that the systematic errors played the key \r
role in data discord. The possible sources of error were \r
attributed to: \r
i. Inadequate care in checlring the pyramidal error. \r
If the wedge angle was not perpendicular to the circle \r
and parallel to the telescope, the effective angle would \r
be greater than the true wedge angle with the conse\u0002quence of a larger deviation angle which would 'lead \r
to a larger value of refractive inde);. \r
ii. Small wedge angle of the samples. For a highly \r
refracting material such as silicon, a small wedge \r
angle is required to measure the refractive index. As \r
a result, large errors in angle measurement can be \r
introduced and hence in the observed refractive index. \r
iii. Broad detector used. Observation in the infrared \r
requires a detector in the determination of deviation \r
angle. The detectors that have been used are in general \r
many times broader than the width of the spect.ral \r
line, thus decreasing the accuracy in reading the \r
angles. Significant errors are, therefore, inevitably \r
introduced. \r
iv. Optical inhomogeneity of the sample. Optica.l \r
inhomogeneity of the material causes image distortion \r
ItllU ~Lu,,; LIJt:l tUTO]' iu ~he lhllgh: :;ettiug. \r
Among the above sources, t.he smaDness of the wedge \r
angle is the major factor that contributes to t.he error. \r
A combination of these contributions limits the a.c\u0002cura.cy of the measurement of the rehactive jndex by \r
the minimum deviation method to 1 or 2 units in t.he \r
third decimal place, a few t,imes higher than that \r
claimed by most investigators. \r
The effect of impurities on the refractive index is \r
considerable. In some cases, observations made on \r
samples of questionable origin and undefined purity \r
may yield radically different results. Villa !Hi) re\u0002ported his grossly divergent values (shown in figure 3) \r
to show that samp)e differences can be very slgnlncant. \r
In figure lone can see Simon's [1711'adically different \r
results obtained for a silicon sample of high impurity \r
content. The data of Spitzer et a.l. [18], obtained on \r
heavily doped silicon, are significantly divergent from \r
~ho::;e of jJUHj !:;/l,ll1jJl~~. Thus, when the effects (If im\u0002purjtjes are taken into consideration, discrepancies \r
from pure samples may be much larger t.han 2 parts \r
in the third decimal place. \r
Although the factors discussed above are well \r
known, unfortunately they are generally not cited \r
in literature, but must be deduced from the assigned \r
accuracies. III the pre5ent work it is a:55umed that \r
data sets that are discordant only in the third decimal \r
J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 9, No.3, 1980 \r
. place are in reasonabJe agreement. This assumption \r
can be supported by a careiul comparison of the ob\u0002servations by Icenogle et a1. (51 in which the va1ues of \r
the refractive index at a given wave]engtb and tem\u0002perature, obtained from wavelength-dependence ob-\r
,ervation and from temperature-dependence observa\u0002jon, can be difterent in many cases by more than \r
I, part in the third decimal, few times higher than the \r
11aimed precision of ±3Xlfr\\ \r
More data can be found in references [19-30] and \r
He given in tables A-I and A-2, in which one can find \r
also data sets obtalned on tbin films. No attempt was \r
made t.o analyze the t.hin film data.. However, it has \r
b ~en observed that the refractive indices of pure silicon \r
tl.in films tend to agree ¥rith those of bulk crystal if \r
tl e films are deposited on substrates maintained at \r
el'lvated temperatures during deposition or appro\u0002priately annealed after deposition. Surface contamina\u0002tic n appears to be the most serious problem. However, \r
da ~a for thin films reported by those who exercise ap\u0002pn 'priate precautions in the sample preparation are \r
uSI.ally in agreement with those of bulk material. \r
l,iterature data on the temperature coefficient of the \r
refl active index is rather scarce. Data reported in \r
tab.88 A-3 and A-4 and plotted in figures 4 and 5 are \r
tho::e of Lukes [4, 14J. His values were evaluated from \r
his :neasurements given in table A-2 aud in figure 2. \r
A though a significant body of data on the refractive \r
inde\\. of silicon is available, an attempt to analyze \r
data has been rare. In the literature, only one quantita\u0002tive study has been proposed. Hertzberger and Salz\u0002berg [31J proposed a dispersion equation for silicon \r
WhlCl L was derived in conjunction with 13 other \r
mate·ials. They not.ed that it comparison of t.he data \r
from 14 :roaterials indicated that aB had refractive \r
index values varying asymptotically with ),.2. Further\u0002more, the mean asynrptote was found to be at 1.0= \r
0.168 urn. The dispersion relation was based upon Ii \r

The det3rminution of the coefficients in this equa.tion \r
was ba:s.ld on a single data set by Salzberg and Villa \r
113) ~nd the fit is exoellent. \r
In the present work, eq (10) is used to represent the \r
refractivd index for silicon. The main task was the \r
selection of the appropriate parameters E and }..i, and \r
the deter.nination of the coefficients A and B. But the \r
most imp )rtant of all was the selection of reliable data \r
sets used tS input information to eq (10). The selected \r
dntn were limited to the worke of Salzberg 9.nd VillI<, \r
Primak, a ld Icenogle at a1. Data from Cardona et a1. 

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SILICON AND GERMANIUM 567 \r
and Lukes were not used on the basis that their \r
valuet; had tu be read off from the graphs in their \r
reports. Deviations between the graph readings and \r
the true values can occur in the second decimal place of \r
the data. The data of Briggs were not chosen as his \r
values disagree in the second decimal place with the cor\u0002responding values of Primak who exercised great care \r
in the experiment for high purity silicon specimens. \r
The remaining data :;eLt; f!"Om Primak, SalzbeTa Ilnd \r
Villa, and Icenogle et a1. constitute the bnsis ;f ou)" \r
recommendations. Their results are in a,areement in \r
the third decimal as expected. Fortunatel;, Icenogle's \r
work covered a sizable temperature range, t.hus per\u0002mitting the prediction of the refraction index at \r
temperatures other than room temperature. \r
Selection of f and A1 in eq (10) was rather difficult. \r
Figure 6 shows the results of Cardona, et a1. [3] who \r
observed the relative changes of refractive index, \r
Anln. at a wavelength of 3 .urn as tempp.T'll.t.nl'P. vnript\\ \r
between 77 to 400 K. The average slope, (lIn) (dnldT) , \r
of this curve is (3;9±0.4)X 10-sK-l. Lukes [4,14] ob\u0002tained a higher value of 4.8±0.2XIO-5\r
K-l for \r
(lin) (dnjdT) by ex('rapulating his results to longer \r
wavelengths. It appeared that at long wavelengt:hs, \r
f in eq (10) could be determined from the relnt.ion \r
(ljf) (dEjdT) = (2jn) (dnjdT) using one of the above \r
mentioned (ljn) (dnjdT) values. The result should be \r
an exponential relation of the form f=EoeCT• However, \r
es the constancy of (lIn) (dn/dT) does not hold for the \r
'tvide termperl1ture range of our interest, all tllllpirical \r
relation between E and T had to be found based on Oil' \r
experimental data on n. \r
I t. is shown in figure 2 that curves of temperature \r
dependence of refractive index at. various wavelengt,hs \r
are essentially parallel to each other and that. eacll of \r
them smoothly and monotonically increases wit.h \r
temperature. This provides the possibilit.y to find \r
relations between t and T. Since E is nearly equal 1,0 71.2 \r
at long wavelengths, the best choice in the present cnse \r
seemed to be the refractive indices at 10.27 J.Lm bv \r
Icenogle et al. [5]. As the available data of neT) at 10.2i \r
j.Lm cover only the limited temperature ranO'e from . 0 \r
100 to 298 K, a WIder temperat.ure range coverage is \r
needed to establish the relation between t and T elm!, \r
is valid over the temperature range 100-750 K. As \r
shown in figure 2, the 5.156 j.Lm curve by Lukes [14] is \r
slightly above, but. parallel to, the extension ma(le \r
from the 10.17 101m curve. The required 10.27 p'm dnj,n \r
in the high temperature region can be estimated by an \r
appropriate extrapolation of Icenogle'S data within \r
that region. III (,hit; way, the following polynomial \r
expression is found to be valid at 10.27 /.1m ond aver \r
100-750 K temperature range, \r
n2(10.27 p'm, T) =11.4552+2.7765 X 10-4T+ L 7066 \r
X 1O-6T2- 8.1423 X lO-IOT3. (20) \r
Since at' long wavelengths the dielectric constant \r
closely approaches 71.2, it is acceptable to consider the \r
above quantity as a proportional factor and thus \r
express the dielectric constant by the relation \r
(21) \r
where E is the proportional constant. \r
The spectral positions of resonant absorption peaks \r
have been observed by a number of investigators. Moss \r
132) made an attempt to cakulaLe the refractive indices \r
in the transparent region from the absorption data \r
based on the general principle of oscillatory' syst,em. \r
~he spect!al position of the natural frequency in hii'l \r
i'llDgle OSCIllator model was determined at 3.4 eV or \r
1-=0.365 p.m. McLean [2] investigated the absorption \r
edge spectrum of silicon and found the optical energy \r
gap a,t 300 K to be E g=l.12 eV or AI=1.1071 /-1m. \r
Macfarlane et al. [7J further studied the absorption \r
edge spectrum and found that the temperature varia\u0002t,ion of the optical energy gap is essentially' linear in \r
the temperature region 250-480 K, but nonlinearity \r
progressively predominates at lower temperat,ures, as \r
seen from figure 7. Lukes and Schmidt [91 studied the \r
I'I?fledivity spectrum of oi11con aDd found two adJi\u0002tiona! absorption peaks at about 0.36 and 0.27 /Lm. \r
The first one is in line with the Moss' [32J result, while \r
the second corresponds to the prediction of Y u and \r
CnrdODn, [33]. A summary of these findings results in \r
t.hrcc absorption peaks; namely: AI=1.1071 JLm, \r
1-2=O.~65. JLm, and A8=0.27 JLm, that supposedly \r
llilvc slgmficl'l.nt. ",fl'l'ets OD the refractive iDdex iD the \r
tr:mspnrent region from 1.2 to ]4 /-1m. \r
An attempt was made to fit the selected data to an \r
eq1l:1.1,ioD similar to eq (10) by including extra t.erms \r
due {,o 1-2 lInd A3' It was found, however, that the in\u0002t.roduct.ion of the A2 aand A3 terms did not improve the \r
1ll!l'eement obtained when only the AI term was in\u0002clllded. Furthermore, the coefficients of the A2 and As \r
terms eould not be uniquely defined because t,here \r
were no reliable data in the regions bounded by Ilnd \r
!lenr t.he thrflp. pp.A.k wllvelengths. Also, the valuc of B \r
\\Vas found to be negligibly sma!l, thus making the \r
(;ontTibution of the last term in eq (10) insignificant. \r
As :l consequence, eq (18) was adopted and -the len.st, \r
"qua.res fitting of selected data to this equation yielded \r
t.he following expression for the refractive index of \r
silicon in the ranges 1.2 to]4 jJ.n1 ano 100-750 K. \r

It should be pointed out that the room-tempern.ture \r

the expression for E in eq (22). The result is 11.66 \r
which agrees well with the commonly accepted value \r

are given in table 1 and plotted in figure S. To provide \r

to ~~e inho~ogeneitjes and- impurities in the samples \r
whICh effectIvely reduced the thickness of the ca\u0002pacitors and t.hus resulted in an apparent increase in \r

Rank et aI. [35J meo..sured the refractive index over \r

interferometric method. A single crystal ge.rmrmium of \r
unspecified purity wo..s used and t.he result.ing 11.'8 were \r
about. 0.01 higher than the corresponding values of \r
Briggs. The tempemture variation of the refractive \r
index was observed to have, a positive coefficient and \r
the absorption edge moved to longer wavelengths as \r
t.emperature increased. \r
Lukes 136, 37] meo..sured the refract.ive index for \r
several germanium prism samples cut from single \r
crystals of varying impurity. His measurements were \r
carried out over a wavelength range of 1.8-5.5 p.ro \r
and the temperature range 100-530 K. 'The results \r
obtained for the purest sample were in agreement with \r
those of Salzberg and Villn, while the results for the \r
impure samples showed discrepancies at the long \r
wflyolengthc, the higher the impurit,y, the lower the \r
n. In the shorter wavelength region, <4 ).tm, the \r
refmctive index appeared pract.ically independent on \r

IcenogJe et a1. [5] made n t.horough investigation \r
on the refractive index for germanium over the 95-297 \r
K and 2.554-12.360 ).tm regions. 'The samples were \r

l1igher t.haD the earlier works. The sources for such \r
cii"c.repnnc.ies can possibly be ascribed to differences in \r

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SILICON AND GERMANIUM 583 \r
True internal consistency was observed in each \r
measurement, unaccounted sources or errors were re\u0002sponsible for the discrepancies. \r
Primak [15] devoted considerable space to dis\u0002cussions of both systematic and random errors for \r
the O(!'SG of silioon (see subsection 3.1). The eonc1usjon,; \r
are generally valid for other materials. Among the \r
possible sources, the smallness of the prism angle is \r
the major factor that contributes to the error. \r
Combined with the errors fr om other sources, the \r
limit of accuracy in the measurement of n by the \r
minimum deviation method is 1 to 2 parts in the \r
third decimal pI !1CC , n, few times higher than thni \r
claimed by many workers. \r
The effect of impurities on the refractive index j~ \r
considerable. In some cases, observations made on \r
samples of questionable origin and undefined purity \r
may yield ra,dically different results; Simon [17] re\u0002ported his radically different results (shown in figure \r
11) obtained for a germanium sample of high impurity \r
content. Spitzer et al. [44] investigated the opt,ieni \r
constants of heavily doped germanium with res1111,,",, \r
greatly different from those of pure samples shown in \r
figure 11. Thus, "Then the effects of impuritie~ arC' \r
taken into consideration, discrepancies from pure \r
samples may be much higher than 2 parts in t.he third \r
decimal place. \r

made to analyze the thin film data. However, it hn~ \r
been observed that the refractive indices of pure \r
germanium thin films tend to agree with those of blllk \r
crystal if the films are deposited on substrates l11nin\u0002tamed at elevated temperatures during the COllr:':(l of \r
deposition or appropriately annealed after deposition. \r
Surface contamination appears to be the most ~eri()lI'; \r
problem. However, data for thin films reporte,j hy \r
those who exercised precaution in sample prepnTlll iOll \r
are usually in agreement with those for bulk mn.i.erinl. \r
Literature it!l.tfi on the t.emper!1.ture derivntiv(' of \r
the refractive index of germanium is rather sean'e. \r

in figures 14 and 15 are mainly those of Ll1ke:-; 1%, \r
58, 59]. His dnjdT values were evaluated from hj~ \r
measurements of n given in table A-6 and fig·me ] 2. \r
Although considerable amounts of experimental \r
data on the refractive index of germanium are avail\u0002able, they have received little analysis. The earliest \r
quantitative results for germanium are generally at\u0002tributed to Brattain and Briggs [41]. 'VhiJe they \r
presented no dispersion relations in their work, they \r
noted that their results were extremely sensitive to \r

arose between samples. \r

The next dispersion rclation was advanced by Hertz\u0002herger and Salzberg [31] which they developed using \r

Sueh a la~ ~e discrepancy cannot be accounted for by \r
merely cx~,erimental errors. Unknown impurities in \r
some of t~~ samples are probably responsible for the \r
differences'l However, this very important information \r
is generallYi missing from the papers. As a result, the \r
current kno'l vledge of the refractive index of germanium \r
still remain~ uncertain. Results of Edwin et a1. [38] a.nd \r
Icenogle et \\. 11. [5] are uniformly higher than those of \r
Salzberg an . Vi1lH [13] in the long wavelength region. \r
Spitzer and 'an [44) observed that the refractive index \r
of an imPU~l sample in the long wavelength region \r
is lower tharl that of a purer specimen. According to \r
t,h;~, it, w0'l11J. seem t.hllt. S!llzberg and Villa, had more \r
impurities iul their specimen than did Edwin and \r
Icenogle. Thi! is not the case, however, as the above \r
mentioned da\\a sets are essentially parallel in the long \r
wavelength rlgion while Spitzer and Fan's results \r
indicate a pr6,~ressively decreasing n with increasing \r
wavelength (s\\ e figures 1 and 11). Based on t.his con\u0002sideration, the seleetod d (.til scts were given equal \r
weight. Fort.uD,ately, data by Icenogle et al. cover a \r
sizable tempert ture range, permitting the prediction I of n at temperatures other than room temperature. \r
Selection of \\: and A] presented some difficulties. \r
Cardona et al. \\ [3] observed the relative changes of \r
refractive indexi: t::.n/n, at a wavelength of 3 }.1m as \r
tempera, L UHl vl:Li,ied from 77 to 400 K with results \r
plotted in figure; 16. The average slope, (1 In) (dn/dT) \r
of this plot is :!,'6.9±OA) X 10-5K-1. Icenogle et 0.1. \r
obtained a highlllr value, of 9.9Xl0-5I{-] for (ljn) \r
(dn/dT) in the 'yavelength range 2.5M to ]2.] }.1m. \r
It appeared thai d in eq (0) could be determined from \r
the relation (lit) (~~e/dT) = (2/n) (dn/dT) using the value \r
01' (lin) (dn/dT) at long wavelengths. The result would \r
be an exponential';relation of the form E=EoetT• How\u0002ever, the constanc:r of (l/n)(dn/dT) does not hold for \r
a wide temperl'l.t.m P. rll.ne'!>., B ",nee, Rn empirical reI ... -\r
tion between f and. T should be found based on [tvai]-\r
able data of n. \r
It is shown in figure 12 that curves of temperature \r
dependence of refra;\\tive index at various wavelengths \r
are essentially parallel to each other and that each of \r
them smoothly nn.1 monotonically increases with \r
temperature. This provides a possibility to find n \r
relation between E ll.n.d T. As E closely equals n2 nt long \r
wavelengths, the bes\\: choice in the present case is th~ \r
refractive indices at 10.27 }.1m by Icenogle et al. 15J. \r
However, their result!: cover only a temperature range \r
from 100 to 298 K . .A wider temperat.ure coverage is \r
required to establl::;ll L !'eIa.tion between E and T that \r
is reliable over the te:nperature region 100-550 K of \r
genera] interest. As sh:>wn in figure 12, the 5.156 }.1m \r
curve of Lukes [36) is slightly above and parallel to \r
the extension made fDm the 10.27 J.Lill curve. The \r
needed refractive indices at 10.27 }.1m in the higher \r
temperature region w~ therefore obtained by appro\u0002priate extrapolation of ::cenogle's data in that' region. \r
J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 9, No.3, 1980 \r
In this way, the following polynomial equation is \r
found to be valid 'at lO.27 j.!lll and over 100-550 K: \r
n2(10.27 ~m, T)=15.3122+ 1.4571 X 1O- 3T \r
+3.5131 X 1O-6T2-1.2089X 1O-9T3. (27) \r
Since at long wavelengths the dielectric constant \r
closely approaches but does not exactly equal n2, it \r
is therefore appropriate to consider the above quan\u0002tit,y JlS fl. proportional factor o,nd the dielectric constaut, \r
is expressed as: \r
E(T)=En2(10.27 .um , T), \r
where E is the proportional constant. \r
Spectral positions of natural absorption peaks in \r
germanium have been studied by a number of inves\u0002tigators. McLean [2] investigated the absorption edge \r
spectrum of germanium and found the optical energy \r
gap at 300 K to be Eg=0.663 eV or A1=1.8703 }.1m. \r
l\\1n.cfnrlilne et al. [8] further ::;Luuieu the absorption \r
edge spectrum and found the temperature variation \r
of the optical energy gap is essentially linear in t.he \r
. temperature range 200-300 K, but nonlinearit,y pro\u0002gressively predominates at lower temperatures as \r
shown in figure 17. Lukes and Schmidt [9] studied the \r
reflectivity spectrum of germanium and found two \r
Il.dditiona.1 absorption pea.ks at A2~ 0.589 }.1m and \r
As' .... ' 0.282 J,.!m. The latter corresponds to that predicted \r
by Yu and Cardona [33]. As a summary of these \r
findings, one now has three absorption peaks; namely: \r
A] = 1.8703 }.1m, V'" 0.589 }.1m, and As' .... , 0.282 }.lID that \r
are supposed to have significant effects on the refrac\u0002tive index in the transparent region, i.9-16 }.lID. \r
In thi:::. wurk, Lhe selected data, were fitted to an \r
equation similar to eq (10) by including extra terms \r
due to A2 and A8. It was found, however, that i.ntro\u0002duction of the A9 and A, terms did not improve t.he \r
agreement obtained when only the Al term was in\u0002cluded. Furthermore, the coefficients of the A2 and Aa \r
terms could not be uniquely defined because there \r
were no reliable data in the regions bounded by and \r
near the three peak wavelengths. Also, the value of B \r
was found to be negligibly low and hence the contri\u0002bution of the last term in eq (10) was insignificant. As \r
;l consequence, eq (18) was adopted and the least \r
squa.res fitting of selected data to this equation yielded \r
the following expression for the refractive index of ger\u0002manium in the ranges of l.~ to H\\ }.1m and 100-550 K: \r

It is interesting to point out that the room tempera\u0002ture dielectric constant for germanium can now be \r
calculated from the expression of E in eq (28). The \r
result is 16.009 which is in good agreement with the \r
commonly accepted value of 16.0. \r
Equation (28) was used to calculate the recom\u0002mended values of the refractive index of germanium \r
with uncertainties of ±2XlO-s. The recommended \r
values are given in table 4 and plotted in figure 18. \r
To provide a visual comparision of the calculated \r
values with experimental data, calculated values at \r
a few specifieu temperatures and wavelength~ aTe \r
plotted in figures 12 and 13 where close agreement \r
is revealed. Tables 5 and 6, respectively, give the \r
calculated dn/dT and dn/dX values based on the first \r
derivatives of eq (28) with respect to T and X. The \r
corresponding plots are shown in figures 19 Ilnd 20. \r
Uncertainties in the calculated dn/dT values are \r
estiwa,Led lmsed Uil Iceilugle't; daLa [liJ w 11ich are \r
essentially the basis for eq (28). Icenogle et al. eval\u0002uated An/I1T values using their own measurements \r
of n and found the average uncertainty in An/AT \r
to be about ± 0.5 X 1O-4K-1. Error bars corresponding \r
to this amount are drawn on the calculated curves \r
in figures 11 (l,Dd 15 where calculated results are \r
compared with experimental data. Although ac\u0002curacies of experimental dn/dT are not available in \r
Lukes' work [36, 38, 59], it is reasonable to use the \r
same error bar as the experimental errors because \r
the n versus T curves in figure 12 are closely parallel. \r
Uncertaint.ies in the calculated dn/dX are estimated \r
from the expression: \r
o(du/dX)~±2on/X, \r
as discussed in subsection 3.1. Similar to the case of \r
silicon, the uncertainties in dn/dX of germanium are \r
about ±5XlO-4\r
J,Lm- 1 at 2.55 J,Lm, 1.2XlO-4J,Lm-1 at \r
10 .um, and 0.7X10-4.um-1 at 18 J,Lm. \r
It should be noted that calculated values in tables \r
4, 5, and 6 are given with more digits than warranted \r
for the purpose of tabular smoothness. \r
As these values are calculated from an equa.tiQD, it \r
is desirable to give enough digits to show the variation \r
of the variables in the equation and to provide com\u0002parasion among neighboring entries. To identify the \r
unwarranted insignificant digits in the values, an \r
overstrike is used. Appropriate uncertainties in the \r
recommended values are discussed in the text and \r

Experimental data on the refractive index of cry~tal\u0002line silicon and germanium and its temperature denva\u0002tive were exhaustively surveyed and reviewed. Values \r
of physical properties wbich are related to the dispel" \r
sion equation were selected from the open literature. \r
In addition, a. number of thin film data sets were also \r
(~ompilec1. \r
The purpose of the present work was to survey and \r
compile the available data and to generate recom\u0002mended values of the refractive index and its tem\u0002perature derivatIve for crystalline siliconanu ger\u0002manium. Recommended values for these ma.terials \r
were generated based on currently availa.ble data. \r
Since the state of the refractive index of eit.her of the \r
crystals have not been well defined, our recommenda\u0002tions should be considered at best representing average \r
values of the selected data sets. Many factors are \r
known to influence the accuracy of the refractive index \r
of a crystal. Although the minimum deviation method \r
is known to be the most accurate way to determine the \r
refraotive index, this is not. t.me in t.he case of silicon \r
and germanium. Being highly refractive, the prism \r
specimens used must be thin, usually about 15° apex \r
angle or sometimes lower, thus giving rise to relative)?' \r
higher uncertaintIes. Utherpossible sources of expen\u0002menta,} errors were discussed by Primak (15]. However, \r
the most important factor which contributes to the \r
total error is the impurit.y cont.pnt. of the specimen. \r
Although tills is a well known source of error, unfor\u0002tunately, this very important piece of information is \r
usually not reported. As a. consequence, discrepancies \r
among the currently available data cannot be reason\u0002ably resolved. \r
Unless one is sa.tisfied with the existing· data having \r
uncertainties of a few parts in the third decimal place, \r
serious considerations should be given to obtaining \r
data reliable in the fourth or fifth decimal place. A \r
systematic Ineasurement program on the refra.ci-ive \r
index should be carried out with the folJowmg con\u0002siderations:"""

germanium have high temperature coefficients of \r
refractive index (in the order of 1O-4K-l), the tem\u0002perature of the sample has to be carefully controlled \r
in order to achieve the required accuracy. Pressure has \r
little effect on the refractive index under ordinary \r
conditions. The pressure coefficient of the refractive \r
index of Ge at 297 K is (l/n)(dnjdP \r
=-7±2XIO-7kg- 1cm2 [3]. That of 8i is -3±2 \r
Xl 0-7kg-1cm2 [3]. \r
In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the \r
present work does not resolve the discrepancies \r
between the available data sets, it simply recommends \r
the most pro bale values of the refractive index that a \r
pure crystal of 8i and Ge may have with the quoted \r
uncertainties. Also, it should be noted that, as in any \r
statistical study of this type, the dispersion equations, \r
eqs (22) and (28), are valid to the reported accuracy \r
only within the region of experimental data. In general, \r
ex1.mpo!n,tion of these equations for use outside of this \r
region is invalid for quantitative results. Fina.lly, t.he \r
type of analysis presented here assumes the data t.o be \r
:111 n.bsolutely correct representation of the model at. \r
hn.))d, which is not generally true since the model is un \r
oversimplification of the true dispersion relation. \r
However, for predictive purposes, based upon the \r
experimental data from several authors, and within \r
t,he lIsnble region of the data, we believe that these \r
efjll:l.t.ions are valid for calculation of the refract.ive \r
index in the given wavelength and tempera.ture \r

1. Introduction \r
The refractive index of a material is one of its \r
fundamental and useful optical properties. Accurate \r
knowledge of the refractive index over a wide range of \r
wavelength is indispensable for many applications. \r
Although this property ('.ontinues to l'f'.f'.p.ivp. 1l.ttAnt10n \r
for both industrial as well as purely scientific applica\u0002tions, t.he current state of the availab1e data for certain \r
widely used mater-ials is less than adequate. While \r
experimental results for the refractive ind.ex of pure \r
silicon and germa.nium are reported by several groups \r
of investigators claiming high internal accuracy and \r
agreement, t.he d!tt.ll. ll.<:; n. wholp. 1l.1'p. in disagreement. \r
In this study, an attempt is made to consolidate \r
all of the published refractive index data on silicon \r
and germanium and to critically evaluate the raw \r
experimental data and techniques of observation. A \r
modified Sel1meier type dispersion relation is utilized \r

2. Theoretical Background on Refractive \r
Dispersion in Crystals \r
Dispersion relations are of fundamental importance \r
to the descript,ion of the optical propert,ies of materials. \r
Thev relate both the absorptive and dispersive prop\u0002erti;s into one relatively concise statement describing \r
a o-eneral lineal' relationship between fundament·al b •. . \r
amplit.udes. The only two maJor restnctlOns are \r
boundedness and causality, thus t·hese l'el,HiolJ" ~.re \r
useful in many fields and applications in both phYSICS \r
and eng-ineering-. \r
The ~dispersi~n of radiat.ion in an optical material \r
is' intimately reiated to the microscopic structure of \r
t,he materi~l itself. In t.he most genera,] terms, long \r
wavelength transmission of a pure crystal is limited by \r
molecular vibrations, rotations while short wavelength \r
transmission is limited by the electronic excit.ations of \r
individual atoms. Practically, this implies that the \r
fundamental transpa.rent spectral range may be deter\u0002mined by knowledge of the absorpt.ion spectra of a 

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SiLICON AND GERMANIUM 563 \r
material. The energy necessary for electronic excita\u0002tionsis generally noted by the location {)f the energy \r
gaps whide the molecular excitation is represented by \r
the fundamental phonon frequency. Experimentally, \r
both of these parameters may be altered by various \r
techniques including doping, stress, strain, and tem\u0002perature variations. One other area of primary im-\r
· portance is that of point defects. The varied effects of \r
point defects in semiconducting materials plays an \r
important role in both the eJectrical and opticaJ prop-\r
.erties, however a detailed analysis· of these effects is \r
beyond the scope of this work. A more complete \r
analysis of these effects is given by Crawford and \r
Slifkin [1] . \r
. In general, the absorption and transmission of a \r
material is not well known except for a small wave-\r
·.leligth range. Thus, on .... theotetical grounds, it. is \r
convenient to consider dispersion as arising from two \r
mttj91'SOUrCes separately; namely, the bound and free \r
electrullli. III lion-conducting dielectric n:u;tteriab,. the \r
bound electron. 01' molecular, interactions tend to \r
predomiIHlte, while free electron interactions are most \r
common in metals. In semiconductirig materials, both \r
of these contributions may be important. In fact, most. \r
· semiconductors show an optical absorption and an \r
anomalous dispersion in the far-infrared region. This \r
effect· is I"/j,thtl!" billWllin covalent semiconducton., like \r
Siand Ge,.it increases, however, with increasing polar\u0002ity.Boththeradio-frequency measurement and infra\u0002red observation indicate that the effect of free carriers \r
on Si and Geare negligibly small. Furthermore, in the \r
elemental Siand Ge, the lattice has no permanent \r
dipole moment and consequently the lattice absorption · issmaJl. . \r
For pure dielectrics, the wavelength 01' frequency \r
dependence of the optical constants may be described \r
hy. t.llP. ~1R;:;Rical treatment of Lorentz. The theory \r
assumes the solid to be composed of a series of inde\u0002pendent oscillators, which are set into forced vibrations \r
by the incident radiation. The Lorentz theory of \r
absorption and dispersion for both insulating and \r
semi-conducting mat.erials leads to the two familiar \r
· relations, \r
(1) \r
and \r
(2) \r
where n is the refractive index, K the absorption inel ex, \r
N:1 the parameter associated with the os cill a tor \r
!jtrength of the ~:-th oscillator, ll~ the resonant frequency \r
of the i-th oscillator mid 'Yl the damping constant of the \r
,i-th oscillator. In t.he transparent wa~e]ength region, \r
· eq(l) can be reduced to a Sel1m~ier type equation by \r
neglecting the line width of t.he oscillators, thus \r
reducing t.o: \r
(3) \r
Terms in the first s~ation are contributions from \r
the ultraviolet absorption bands and . those· in the \r
second from the infrared absorption bands. From eq \r
(3), the dielectric constants, E", and E.O, of the material \r
under consideration are defined as: \r
and (4) \r
As noted before, the effects of free carries and lattice \r
absorption are found to be negligibly small in elementai \r
Si and Ge, thus t,he contributions from infrared absorp..; \r
tion bands cnn be dropped and eqs (3) and (4) are \r
simplified t,o; \r
(5) \r
and \r
(6) \r
In an ideal applicntion of eq (5), one would need to· \r
know the wa ve1engths of all of the absorption peakS in \r
the short wfl'Velcll!!th rcgkln. This is very difficult in ... \r
practice because of the large number of absorption \r
peaks. In fllCt., only 1\\ few absorption peaks are nc':' \r
cessible for experimental observation.· It is also \r
observed that nmong the nbsorption peakS, only the \r
one that is located closest to the transparent region has \r
noticeable eHecL OIl the refractive index in the trans~ \r
parent region. In order to simplify t.he calculations \r
of the effect due to unobserved absorption bands and \r
those other thfln the one affecting most the refractive \r
index ill t.lw tmrll5parent region, .the following con\u0002siderations were i,aken. Each term, except the pre\u0002dominuting one, in the summation of eq (5) is' \r
expnnded Il.!:l: \r

Since A/s are usually considerably smaller than A'S in . \r

greatest effect on the refractive index In the· trans-' \r

can be generalized to inc1ude temperature as an in\u0002pendent variable. In this case, the parameters t, A, B, \r
and Al are functions of temperature. \r
At long wavelengths, the dielectric constant, E, is \r

Cardona, raul, and Brooks [3] found the long\u0002wavelength (l/n) (dn/dT) to be (3.9±0.4)X10-5K-I \r
for Si and (6.9::::0A) X 1O-5K-I for Ge, between 77 and \r
400 K. Higher values of (l/n)(dn/T) were observed \r
by other workers: (4.8±0.2)X 1O-5K-I for silicon [4] \r
and 9.7XlO-5K-I for germanium [5]. However, these \r
constant values of (1/n) (dn/ d T) only hold at high \r
temperatures. Devj!L~joB ffUilllilltl!Lri~y u,t, low temper\u0002atures requires that a non-linear relation between \r
E and T be established. The values of the dielectric \r
constant which appea,r in the literature are inaccurate. \r
In the survey work of Young and Frederikse (6), the \r
value for Si varies from 1].7 to ] 2.1 and that of Ge \r
from 13.6 to 16.6. As a consequence, the report,ed \r
values of E are not suitable for eq (10) and E(T) caB \r
only be obtained by fitting selected room-temperature \r
refractive index data to eq (10). The temperature de\u0002pendence of Al was investigated by Macfarlane et at \r
(7, 8], their results are dA;/dT=O.000267 /Jm K-I for \r
Si and 0.001016 11m K-I for Ge at temperatures higher \r
than 200 K. Non-linearity predominates at low \r
temperatures. \r
The parameters, A and B, in eq (10) can be ex\u0002pressed in terms of temperature based on the con\u0002siderations given below. Sinoo \r
!VI \r
A= 2: a;A/ and B=aj (12) i=2 \r
and the a's are respectively proportional to the density \r
of the corresponding oscillator, the temperature de\u0002pendence of ai is given by the relation \r
(13) \r
where 17 and a are respectively the volume and the \r
thermal expansion coefficient of the material. Hence \r
-al T "dT (14) aj=ajOe 293 =a(Oe- 36L (r)/L213, \r
with aO! being the value of aj at 293 K. Furthermore, \r
each of the }./,s in the summa,tion can be considered \r
as a quadratic function of temperature because it is an \r
experimentally observed fact that Ai is approximately \r
a linear function of T (9] in the temperature region of \r
interest. Therefore \r

There are a number of experimental methods used \r
for the determinat.ion of refractive index, among which \r
the following a.re those commonly used: \r
DeviatIOn method (prism method) \r
Interference method \r
Trll..nsmission method \r
Reflection method \r
High frequency modulation method \r
Brewster angle method \r
Polarization method \r
Thickness determination method \r
Multilayer method \r
The methods listed above are arranged in the order of \r
their inherent accuracy or popularity. The deviation \r
method is the most popular means of determining the \r
refract.ive indices, but the accuracy of the results \r
depends on t.he conditions of the prism specimen. \r
The highest accuracy that can be attained is in the \r
fifth decima.1 place. The interference technique can be \r
used to obtain data up to the fourth decimal place. \r
Transmission and reflection methods yield results \r
good to the second place, while the multilayer results \r
are no better than two places. For a comprehensive, \r
yet concise, review of all these methods, thf'. TAROf'.T ;" \r
referred to references [10] and [11]. \r
Dispersion equations for Si and Ge have been \r
proposed in earlier works. Available relations a·re dis\u0002cussed in the text so as to facilitate comparison. \r
Refractive indices for most. of selected data sets are \r
report.ed to the fourth decimal place. However, de\u0002ta.iled compositions and cha.racteriza.tions of the \r
specimens were usually not clearly given. Since im\u0002purit.ies in the sample a.nd conditions of t.he surface \r
are decisive fact.ors affect.ing the a.ccuracy of the \r
observed results, such highly precise data cannot be \r
applied to a· sample chosen at. random. For this reason \r
no attempt is made to recommend any particular set \r
of da.ta with the reported hlgh accUlacy, but to g~ll~l'­\r
ate t.he most probable values for the pure crystals. \r
As a result, the estimat.ed uncertainties for the recom\u0002mended values on the refractive index are higher t.han \r
those for the reported data obtained even by high\u0002precision measurements. The accuracy of the recom\u0002mended refractive index values in t.his work is \r
estimated to be 1 to 2 X 10-3 • \r
3.1. Silicon, Si \r
There are 55 sets of experimental data available for \r
the refractive index (wavelength dependence and tem\u0002perature dependence) of silicon as tabulated in tables \r
A-I and A-2 and plotted in figures 1 and 2. It should \r
be pointed out that a few of the data sets are from \r
observations for thin films and are reported here for \r
purposes of comparison. After careful review and eval\u0002uation of the available information, it. was found that. \r
data sets reported by Briggs [12], Sa.1zberg and Villa \r
[13], Cardona et a1. [3], Lukes [4, 14], Primak [15], and \r
Icenogle et a1. [5] are representative for the rflfrfl.l".t.ivA \r
index of silicon in the transparent region between 1.3 \r
and 12 ILm. . \r
Briggs [121 probably was the first one who reported \r
the measured refractive index of silicon. A 1:I\\:1.~% pure \r
silicon wedge specimen of about 11.5° apex angle was \r
investigated using minimum deviation method over a \r
spectral range from 1.05 to 2.60 11m. He stated that \r
the accuracy of his measurements was good to the \r
second decimal place. \r
Since this first measurement, a number of other \r
investigat,ions have been made. RefractIve index det.er\u0002mination from 1.35 to 11.04 11m was made by Salzberg \r
and Villa [13] for a wedge specimen of about 160 apex \r
ll..nglfl. ThA sflmplA, of nnknown purity, WQS obtained \r
from the Texas Instrument Company. The autocol1i\u0002mat.ion minimum deviation method was used to deter\u0002mine the refractive index. Their result.s were lower \r
than those of Briggs by about 5 parts in tbe third \r
decimal place. They claimed an accuracy of ±2 parts \r
in t.he fourt.h decimal place. \r
Cardona et al. [14] measured t.he refractive index of \r
II thin silicon wedge of 5° in the wavelength range \r
from 1 to 5 ILm and at temperatures 100, 194, and \r
297 K. Theil' results were :lbout 4 parts in the third \r
decimal place lower than the corresponding ones of \r
Briggs. \r
Lukes i4, 14] measured the refract.ive index at five \r
wavelengths, 1.259, 1.407, 1.564, 2.409, and 5.156 I'm, \r
over a wide temperature region bet.ween 109 and 750 l{ \r
by the convent.ional method of minimum deviat.ion. \r
The silicon wedge of ,....., 18° angle was prepared from \r
fl p-type single cryst.al wit.h a resist.ivity of ,....., 380 \r
ohm-cm. The report.ed eITor was ± "-"'0.0004, but his \r
values of refract.ive index were systematically lower \r
t.han t.hose of Salzberg and Villa by 0.0015. \r
Primak [15] went to great lengt.hs in the det.ermina\u0002tion of the refractive index of silicon from 1.12 to 2.16 \r
)..Lm. His results corresponded closely to those report.ed \r
by Lukes. As he t.ook into account. all of t.he influencing \r
fact.ors in arriving at the final values, he believed that \r
his va.]ues were reliable wit.hin an uncert.ainty of 1 or \r
2 pa.rts in the third decimal pJa.ce. \r
Icenogle et a1. [15] made a thorough investigation on \r
the refract.ive index for silicon over the temperature \r
and wavelength ranges of 99-296 K and 2.554-10.27 \r
ILm, respect.ively. The samples ,vere obtained from the \r
Exotic Materials, Inc. and were charact.erized as \r
"good optical grade" without further details of purity \r
of the material. The results are in fair agreement with \r
other dat.a sets. The claimed errors were ± 3 X 10-4\r

For the purpose of ease of comparison, the above \r
mentioned data sets are replotted in figure 3. It is \r
obvious tha.t the disagreement, nmong the values \r
reported by different researchers is greater than the \r
accuracy claimed by them. Although internal consist\u0002ency was observed in each investigtttibn, unaccounted \r
sources of errors are responsible for these discrepancies. \r
Primak [151 devoted considerable space to the dis\u0002cussion of both systematic and random ern)rs with the \r
conclusion that the systematic errors played the key \r
role in data discord. The possible sources of error were \r
attributed to: \r
i. Inadequate care in checlring the pyramidal error. \r
If the wedge angle was not perpendicular to the circle \r
and parallel to the telescope, the effective angle would \r
be greater than the true wedge angle with the conse\u0002quence of a larger deviation angle which would 'lead \r
to a larger value of refractive inde);. \r
ii. Small wedge angle of the samples. For a highly \r
refracting material such as silicon, a small wedge \r
angle is required to measure the refractive index. As \r
a result, large errors in angle measurement can be \r
introduced and hence in the observed refractive index. \r
iii. Broad detector used. Observation in the infrared \r
requires a detector in the determination of deviation \r
angle. The detectors that have been used are in general \r
many times broader than the width of the spect.ral \r
line, thus decreasing the accuracy in reading the \r
angles. Significant errors are, therefore, inevitably \r
introduced. \r
iv. Optical inhomogeneity of the sample. Optica.l \r
inhomogeneity of the material causes image distortion \r
ItllU ~Lu,,; LIJt:l tUTO]' iu ~he lhllgh: :;ettiug. \r
Among the above sources, t.he smaDness of the wedge \r
angle is the major factor that contributes to t.he error. \r
A combination of these contributions limits the a.c\u0002cura.cy of the measurement of the rehactive jndex by \r
the minimum deviation method to 1 or 2 units in t.he \r
third decimal place, a few t,imes higher than that \r
claimed by most investigators. \r
The effect of impurities on the refractive index is \r
considerable. In some cases, observations made on \r
samples of questionable origin and undefined purity \r
may yield radically different results. Villa !Hi) re\u0002ported his grossly divergent values (shown in figure 3) \r
to show that samp)e differences can be very slgnlncant. \r
In figure lone can see Simon's [1711'adically different \r
results obtained for a silicon sample of high impurity \r
content. The data of Spitzer et a.l. [18], obtained on \r
heavily doped silicon, are significantly divergent from \r
~ho::;e of jJUHj !:;/l,ll1jJl~~. Thus, when the effects (If im\u0002purjtjes are taken into consideration, discrepancies \r
from pure samples may be much larger t.han 2 parts \r
in the third decimal place. \r
Although the factors discussed above are well \r
known, unfortunately they are generally not cited \r
in literature, but must be deduced from the assigned \r
accuracies. III the pre5ent work it is a:55umed that \r
data sets that are discordant only in the third decimal \r
J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, Vol. 9, No.3, 1980 \r
. place are in reasonabJe agreement. This assumption \r
can be supported by a careiul comparison of the ob\u0002servations by Icenogle et a1. (51 in which the va1ues of \r
the refractive index at a given wave]engtb and tem\u0002perature, obtained from wavelength-dependence ob-\r
,ervation and from temperature-dependence observa\u0002jon, can be difterent in many cases by more than \r
I, part in the third decimal, few times higher than the \r
11aimed precision of ±3Xlfr\\ \r
More data can be found in references [19-30] and \r
He given in tables A-I and A-2, in which one can find \r
also data sets obtalned on tbin films. No attempt was \r
made t.o analyze the t.hin film data.. However, it has \r
b ~en observed that the refractive indices of pure silicon \r
tl.in films tend to agree ¥rith those of bulk crystal if \r
tl e films are deposited on substrates maintained at \r
el'lvated temperatures during deposition or appro\u0002priately annealed after deposition. Surface contamina\u0002tic n appears to be the most serious problem. However, \r
da ~a for thin films reported by those who exercise ap\u0002pn 'priate precautions in the sample preparation are \r
uSI.ally in agreement with those of bulk material. \r
l,iterature data on the temperature coefficient of the \r
refl active index is rather scarce. Data reported in \r
tab.88 A-3 and A-4 and plotted in figures 4 and 5 are \r
tho::e of Lukes [4, 14J. His values were evaluated from \r
his :neasurements given in table A-2 aud in figure 2. \r
A though a significant body of data on the refractive \r
inde\\. of silicon is available, an attempt to analyze \r
data has been rare. In the literature, only one quantita\u0002tive study has been proposed. Hertzberger and Salz\u0002berg [31J proposed a dispersion equation for silicon \r

REFRACTIVE INDEX OF SILICON AND GERMANIUM 599 \r
4. Conclusions and Recommendations \r
Experimental data on the refractive index of cry~tal\u0002line silicon and germanium and its temperature denva\u0002tive were exhaustively surveyed and reviewed. Values \r
of physical properties wbich are related to the dispel" \r
sion equation were selected from the open literature. \r
In addition, a. number of thin film data sets were also \r
(~ompilec1. \r
The purpose of the present work was to survey and \r
compile the available data and to generate recom\u0002mended values of the refractive index and its tem\u0002perature derivatIve for crystalline siliconanu ger\u0002manium. Recommended values for these ma.terials \r
were generated based on currently availa.ble data. \r
Since the state of the refractive index of eit.her of the \r
crystals have not been well defined, our recommenda\u0002tions should be considered at best representing average \r
values of the selected data sets. Many factors are \r
known to influence the accuracy of the refractive index \r
of a crystal. Although the minimum deviation method \r
is known to be the most accurate way to determine the \r
refraotive index, this is not. t.me in t.he case of silicon \r
and germanium. Being highly refractive, the prism \r
specimens used must be thin, usually about 15° apex \r
angle or sometimes lower, thus giving rise to relative)?' \r
higher uncertaintIes. Utherpossible sources of expen\u0002menta,} errors were discussed by Primak (15]. However, \r
the most important factor which contributes to the \r
total error is the impurit.y cont.pnt. of the specimen. \r
Although tills is a well known source of error, unfor\u0002tunately, this very important piece of information is \r
usually not reported. As a. consequence, discrepancies \r
among the currently available data cannot be reason\u0002ably resolved. \r
Unless one is sa.tisfied with the existing· data having \r
uncertainties of a few parts in the third decimal place, \r
serious considerations should be given to obtaining \r
data reliable in the fourth or fifth decimal place. A \r
systematic Ineasurement program on the refra.ci-ive \r
index should be carried out with the folJowmg con\u0002siderations: \r
1. Experimental method. Because the minimum \r
uevittLivll method does not yield high u.ocuru.cy in th(, \r
case of 8i and Ge, it is strongly felt that the int('r\u0002ference method should be used. In this met.hod, t.lll' \r
determination of interference order plays t.he decisive \r
role in the accuracy of the results. In order t.o obt,Hill \r
high accuracy, thick plate specimens should be us('( I. \r
2. Sample characterization. As the impurity content \r
of the sample strongly affect the refractive index, t.he \r
impurities in the sample should be ascertained and \r
reported. Merely reporting the eJectricaJ resistivi ty of \r
the sample is not adequate. The nature and amount of \r
impurities should specifically be reported. In order to \r
see the effects of impurities on the refractive index, \r
measurement should be carried out for a group of \r
specimens with systematical1y controlled impuri~ies. \r
3. Environm!lntal control. Since both silicon and \r
germanium have high temperature coefficients of \r
refractive index (in the order of 1O-4K-l), the tem\u0002perature of the sample has to be carefully controlled \r
in order to achieve the required accuracy. Pressure has \r
little effect on the refractive index under ordinary \r
conditions. The pressure coefficient of the refractive \r
index of Ge at 297 K is (l/n)(dnjdP \r
=-7±2XIO-7kg- 1cm2 [3]. That of 8i is -3±2 \r
Xl 0-7kg-1cm2 [3]. \r
In conclusion, it should be emphasized that the \r
present work does not resolve the discrepancies \r
between the available data sets, it simply recommends \r
the most pro bale values of the refractive index that a \r
pure crystal of 8i and Ge may have with the quoted \r
uncertainties. Also, it should be noted that, as in any \r
statistical study of this type, the dispersion equations, \r
eqs (22) and (28), are valid to the reported accuracy \r
only within the region of experimental data. In general, \r
ex1.mpo!n,tion of these equations for use outside of this \r
region is invalid for quantitative results. Fina.lly, t.he \r
type of analysis presented here assumes the data t.o be \r
:111 n.bsolutely correct representation of the model at. \r
hn.))d, which is not generally true since the model is un \r
oversimplification of the true dispersion relation. \r
However, for predictive purposes, based upon the \r
experimental data from several authors, and within \r
t,he lIsnble region of the data, we believe that these \r
efjll:l.t.ions are valid for calculation of the refract.ive \r
index in the given wavelength and tempera.ture \r
regions. \r
