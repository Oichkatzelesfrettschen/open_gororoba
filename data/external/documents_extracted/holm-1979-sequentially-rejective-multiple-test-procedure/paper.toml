ABSTRACT. This paper presents a simple and widely ap\u0002plicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective \r
type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a tine until no further \r
rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed \r
level of significance protection against error of the first kind \r
for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties \r
of the test and a number of possible applications are also \r
discussed. \r
Key words: multiple test, simultaneous test \r
1. Introduction \r
The statistical problems arising in applications often \r
involve a number of detail problems, i.e. there are \r
often a number of interesting parameters to be esti\u0002mated and/or a number of interesting hypotheses to \r
be tested. In some cases these detail problems may \r
be treated separately without any connection to each \r
other. But in most cases the detail problems are con\u0002nected to each other and the totality of solutions to \r
the detail problems are used to get a general picture. \r
In this latter case the statistician is faced with a \r
multiple statistical inference problem, where he has \r
to take into consideration that the different detail \r
problems should be treated simultaneously. \r
Multiple statistical inference has been a vital re\u0002search area within statistical inference theory the \r
past 50 years, and methods have been proposed for \r
several situations of practical interest. A good presen\u0002tation of the earlier main results is given by Miller \r
(1966). The multiple statistical inference methods are \r
separated into two main types, multiple confidence \r
interval methods and multiple test methods. \r
For multiple test procedures there has been sug\u0002gested several types of properties, which the tests \r
should have in order to give satisfactory protection \r
against wrong decisions. Some of those are based on \r
decision theoretic conceptions, while others are based \r
on probabilities of making wrong decisions. In this \r
paper we will study multiple test procedures and we \r
will use the most common type of protection against \r
error of the first kind by requiring the tests to have a \r
small probability of rejecting any true hypotheses. \r
The methodological motivation and exact definition \r
is the following. \r
Let the (detail) hypotheses in a multiple test prob\u0002lem be denoted by H1, H12, ..., Hn and the alternatives \r
to those by K., K2, ..., K,. A (non-randomized) mul\u0002tiple test procedure is a rule assigning to each out\u0002come a set of rejected hypotheses (which might be \r
empty). This means that there are also n critical \r
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn consisting of those outcomes \r
for which the corresponding hypotheses are rejected. \r
In a test of a single null hypothesis H1 against an \r
alternative K1 the size of the test is defined as the \r
supremum of the probability of the critical region C1 \r
when the hypothesis H11 is true. This probability of \r
error of the first kind is always kept at (or below) a \r
small predetermined level a. The philosophical rea\u0002son for this is that when we have made a 'discovery' \r
by rejecting the null hypothesis we can quite safely \r
claim that the null hypothesis is not true, because if \r
it was true, we should have accepted it with a \r
probability of at least 1 -oc. This also implies that \r
we do not make any 'discovery' by accepting the null \r
hypotheses, because we do not have such a protec\u0002tion against errors of the second kind. \r
In a multiple test of a number of hypotheses \r
H,, H12, ..., Hn there are a lot of possible combina\u0002tions of null hypotheses. If we want to make our \r
'discoveries' in form of rejected null hypotheses to \r
be safely claimed, we must keep the probability of \r
rejecting any true null hypotheses small, how many \r
and which the true hypotheses may be. Thus we are \r
led to the following definition \r
Definition. A multiple test procedure with critical \r
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn for testing hypotheses Hi, \r
H2, ..., H,, is said to have a multiple level of signifi\u0002cance a (for free combinations) if for any non-empty \r
index set I' {1, 2, 3, ..., n} the supremum of the \r
probability P( u iE C2) when Hi are true for all i eI \r
is smaller than or equal to a. \r
The words 'for free combinations' are put into the \r
definition in order to underline that all subsets of \r
5 - 791923 Scand J Statist 6 

66 S. Holm \r
null hypotheses could appear as the set of true hypo\u0002theses. There might be situations in which all sub\u0002sets are not allowed for some reason, for instance \r
situations where the truth of two hypotheses implies \r
the truth or falseness of a third hypothesis. It is to \r
be observed that a multiple level of significance ac for \r
some restricted combinations imposes fewer condi\u0002tions on the test procedure than a multiple level of \r
significance a for free combinations, i.e. a test proce\u0002dure with multiple level of significance x for free \r
combinations has a multiple level of significance a \r
for any type of restricted combinations. \r
In our setting the basic hypotheses H1, H2, ..., H. \r
are minimal in the sense of Gabriel (1969). This \r
means that if o,, con, ..., on are the parameter sets \r
where the hypotheses H1, H2, ..., Hn are true than \r
the only (secondary) hypotheses to be tested are the \r
hypotheses that the parameter belongs to intersec\u0002tions nf EI co, of sets coi for different index sets \r
Ic- {1, 2, ..., n}. \r
We will exclusively discuss a type of multiple test \r
procedures, which may be called sequentially rejec\u0002tive because basic hypotheses are rejected one at a \r
time according to certain rules. Thus we do not make \r
separate tests of all the (secondary) hypotheses that \r
the parameter belongs to intersections nflI wi for \r
different Ic {1, 2, ..., n}. We always consider such \r
(secondary) hypotheses to be rejected as soon as any \r
of the included basic hypotheses are rejected. \r
A test procedure is called coherent if it prevents \r
the contradiction of rejecting a hypothesis without \r
also rejecting all other hypotheses implying it. It is \r
called consonant if it avoids dissonances consisting \r
in rejecting a hypothesis and not rejecting any other \r
hypotheses implied by it. (See Gabriel, 1969, pp. 229 \r
and 231.) The sequentially rejective tests are coherent \r
and consonant by their very definition. \r
In many applications there are logical implica\u0002tions among the basic hypotheses i.e. some combina\u0002tions of falseness of different basic hypotheses are \r
not allowed because there are no possible parameter \r
points corresponding to those combinations. Then \r
we do not want the multiple test procedure to end \r
up with a statement that the parameter belongs to \r
such an empty set. This requirement has to be \r
studied separately for each kind of logical implica\u0002tion. We will consider only the type of logical im\u0002plications arising when we have two-sided alterna\u0002tives for some parameters, and want to make one\u0002sided statements. \r
The sequentially rejective multiple tests are not \r
completely new. Tests of the same type are discussed \r
by Naik (1975, p. 522), and the consonant closed \r
procedures discussed by Marcus et al. (1976, p. 656) \r
are equivalent to sequentially rejective tests. Marcus \r
et al. (1976) give one particular example of such a \r
test in an analysis of variance situation, and indicate \r
that others can be constructed. But they do not seem \r
to have thought of the simple and general procedure \r
we present in the next section, because that procedure \r
can easily be used to make one-sided rejections, \r
which they have posed as a difficult problem. Our \r
test is based on the simple Boole inequality and can \r
be applied to any parametric or non-parametric \r
model, but yet it has good power properties. It will \r
be shown by examples that it may have considerably \r
higher power than classical multiple test procedures. \r
It also has surprisingly small loss of power compared \r
to the special sequentially rejective tests (or equi\u0002valent consonant closed tests) that can be constructed \r
in different parametric models, for instance analysis \r
of variance models. \r
2. A simple sequentially rejective test \r
In this section we will present a simple sequentially \r
rejective test, which is based on the Boole inequality. \r
The use of the Boole inequality within multiple in\u0002ference theory is usually called the Bonferroni tech\u0002nique, and for this reason we will call our test the \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test. \r
When the n hypotheses H,, H2, ..., Hn are tested \r
separately by using tests with the level ac/n it follows \r
immediately from the Boole inequality that the prob\u0002ability of rejecting any true hypotheses is smaller \r
then or equal to ac. This constitutes then a multiple \r
test procedure with the multiple level of significance \r
a for free combination, the classical Bonferroni \r
multiple test procedure. \r
The separate tests in the classical Bonferroni \r
multiple test are usually performed by using some test \r
statistics, which we will denote here by Y,, Y2, ..., Yn. \r
We suppose now that this is the case, and also that \r
these test statistics have a tendency of obtaining \r
greater values when the corresponding hypothesis is \r
not true. The critical level Sk(Y) for the outcome y of \r
the test statistic Yk is then equal to the supremum of \r
the probability P(Yk >y) when the hypothesis Hk is \r
true. Defining now the obtained levels Rl, R2, ..., Rn \r
by \r
Rk = dk(Yk) \r
the classical Bonferroni test can be performed by \r
comparing all the obtained levels R&, R2, ..., Rn with \r
a/n. \r
The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test will also \r
be defined by the obtained levels. Denoting by R('1 < \r
R'2' 6 ... <R(n, the ordered obtained levels and by \r
H"), H , ..., H'() the corresponding hypotheses, \r
the procedure can most easily be described by scheme \r
1, where ac, 0 <La < 1, is a fixed number. \r

Scheme I \r
The test is performed by starting at the top of the \r
scheme and going down step by step until no further \r
rejection can be done. This can happen either by \r
accepting all remaining hypotheses or rejecting the \r
last hypothesis H(n). \r
Theorem 1. The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test \r
described by scheme I has the multiple level of sig\u0002nificance a for free combinations. \r
Proof. Let I be the set of indexes of the true hypo\u0002theses. By the Boole inequality we then have \r
P Rf >- for all i e \r
m \r
=1-P(R<- for some iEl) \r
where m is the number of elements in I. But if the \r
event \r
{Ri >- for all i e I} \r
m \r
occurs then \r
.R(n + i-M)> ?:,. \r
m \r
and the sequentially rejective test stops in the step \r
n +1 - m or earlier. This implies however that all \r
hypotheses corresponding to obtained levels Ri > \r
ac/m will be accepted and this set of hypotheses in\u0002cludes the set of true hypotheses. O \r
In the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test the \r
obtained levels are compared to the numbers \r
ac ac ac \r
n' n-I' ' \r
whereas in the classical Bonferroni test they are \r
compared to a/n. This means that the probability of \r
rejecting any set of (false) hypotheses using the classi\u0002cal Bonferroni test is smaller than or equal to the \r
same probability using the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test based on the same test statistics. The \r
classical Bonferroni test has been used mainly in \r
situations where no other (more special) multiple test \r
procedure is available. It can always be replaced by \r
the corresponding sequentially rejective Bonferroni \r
test without loosing any probability of rejecting false \r
hypotheses. Except in trivial non-interesting cases \r
the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test has strictly \r
larger probability of rejecting false hypotheses and \r
thus it ought to replace the classical Bonferroni test \r
at all instants where the latter usually is applied. \r
The power gain obtained by using a sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test instead of a classical Bon\u0002ferroni test depends very much upon the alternative. \r
It is small if all the hypotheses are 'almost true', but \r
it may be considerable if a number of hypotheses are \r
'completely wrong'. If m of the n basic hypotheses \r
are 'completely wrong' the corresponding levels at\u0002tain small values, and these hypotheses are rejected \r
in the first m steps with a big probability. The \r
other levels are then compared to ac/k for k = n -m, \r
n-rm-l, n-rm -2, ..., 2, 1, which is equivalent to \r
performing a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test \r
only on those hypotheses that are not 'completely \r
wrong'. \r
A very simple example will indicate how big the \r
power gain may be. Suppose that Yk, k = 1, 2, ..., 10 \r
are independent and normally distributed with para\u0002meters Ilk and 1 for k = 1, 2, ..., 10 and that we want \r
to test the hypotheses Hk: k = 0 against the alterna\u0002tives Ilk >0 for k = 1, 2, ..., 10 at a multiple level of \r
significance 0.05. If four of the Puk's are equal to 0.0, \r
four of them are equal to 6.0 and the remaining two \r
are equal to 3.0, the classical Bonferroni test rejects \r

68 S. Holm \r
both the latter hypotheses with probability 0.439, \r
while the sequentially rejective Bonferroni procedure \r
rejects both with probability 0.565. \r
The great advantage with the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test (as well as with the classical Bon\u0002ferroni test) is its flexibility. There are no restrictions \r
on the type of tests, the only requirement being that \r
it should be possible to calculate the obtained level \r
for each separate test. Further there are no problems \r
in including in the analysis only the a priori interest\u0002ing hypotheses, while more special multiple tests \r
usually include all hypotheses of a certain kind. But \r
when there exist logical implications among the \r
hypotheses problems arise which we have to take in\u0002to consideration. \r
Let as before wl, w02, Ct3, ..., on denote the para\u0002meter sets where the hypotheses H1, H2, H3, ..., Hn \r
are true. Then there exists a logical implication as \r
soon as there is some index set Isuch that nieiC Oi = \r
b. In words this means that some combination of \r
falseness of the different hypotheses is not possible, \r
and the natural condition is of course that we should \r
not end up the multiple test with a statement that the \r
true parameter point is in an empty set. Each type of \r
logical implication requires a special analysis of the \r
properties of the test statistics in order to ensure that \r
the test can not end up with such statements. The \r
only type of logical implication we will consider is \r
the one arising in connection with two-sided rejec\u0002tions. \r
Let y be a (one-dimensional) parameter and sup\u0002pose that H1: y < yO and H2: y > y2o are basic hypo\u0002theses in a multiple test problem. Then C a,l n C co2 = \r
b and both these hypotheses should not be rejected \r
in the multiple test procedure. It is natural to use the \r
same test statistic to test both hypotheses and since \r
we have the convention of rejecting the hypotheses \r
for high values of the test statistics we should have \r
Y2= - Y1. Now for the outcomes Yi of Y1 and y= \r
-Yl for Y2 the obtained levels ail(yi) and A2(Y2) satisfy \r
Y2)UP P(Y2 > Y2) \r
V>Yo \r
> sup P(Y2 > Y2) = sup (1 -P(Y2 < Y2)) \r
V=YO Y=Yo \r
= sup (1 - P(Y1 > y1)) \r
Y=Yo \r
= 1 - inf P(Y1 < y1) \r
Y='Yo \r
> 1 - inf P(Y1 > y1) \r
Y=VYo \r
> 1 -sup P(Y1 > y1) \r
V=Yo \r
> 1-sup P(Y1 > Ay1)1 l(y) \r
V?Yo \r
This means that for any outcomes Yi and Y2 `Y1 \r
of Y1 and Y2 at least one of the obtained levels \r
Mi(Y,) and d2(Y2) is >, and thus both hypotheses \r
H1 and H2 can not be rejected in a sequentially rejec\u0002tive Bonferroni test (or a classical Bonferroni test) \r
for any multiple level of significance cx 6 i. \r
If there are a number of pairs of one-sided hypo\u0002theses and no logical implications beside those with\u0002in the pairs all illogical statements will still be avoided \r
if the same statistics with opposite signs are used \r
within the pairs and the multiple level of significance \r
oc is smaller than or equal to 1. These tests are also \r
coherent and consonant. \r
3. Applications and extensions \r
The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can be ap\u0002plied in all situations where the classical Bonferroni \r
test is usually applied. And it ought to replace the \r
classical Bonferroni test in these cases because it \r
gives only slightly more complicated computations \r
and a non-negligable increase of power. It should \r
however be noted that the sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test can not be used to construct smaller con\u0002fidence sets than those constructed by the classical \r
Bonferroni test. This is so because the confidence \r
set consists of the parameter points that would not \r
be rejected as true parameter points in separate single \r
tests. And when a confidence set is constructed from \r
multiple tests it consists of the parameter points for \r
which none of the detail hypotheses are rejected, \r
which is in fact a special construction of a single test \r
from a multiple test. If the sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test is used in this way it is equivalent to the \r
classical Bonferroni test. \r
The great advantage of the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test (as well as the classical Bonferroni \r
test) is its computational simplicity, which arises \r
from the reduction of the distributional problems to \r
one dimension when the Boole inequality is used. The \r
same computational simplicity is obtained when the \r
test statistics are independent. It is easily seen that \r
a sequentially rejective procedure with multiple level \r
of significance a can be constructed by replacing the \r
comparison constants c/n, cx/(n -1), ..., c/1 in the \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test by 1 - (1 - c)11', \r
1 - (1 - c)1/(nl1)' ..., 1 - (1 - cc)1, which are greater. \r
This means that we get a more powerful test, but the \r
increase in power is not very big. Among the \r
numerous possible applications of the sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test we will next mention a few. \r
The problem of comparing several treatments with \r
one control have been studied by several authors. \r
For the case of normally distributed observations the \r
multiple test procedure suggested by Dunnett (1955) \r
is commonly used. It requires the same number of \r
Scand J Statist 6 

Sequentially rejective multiple test 69 \r
observations for all treatments, and it is based on \r
the assumption that the variance is the same for the \r
control and all treatments. Marcus et al. (1976) have \r
proposed a closed test procedure, which is a refine\u0002ment of the Dunnett procedure and which is more \r
powerful. Their procedure is equivalent to a sequenti\u0002ally rejective procedure presented in Holm (1977). \r
The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can also \r
be used in this situation although it is of course less \r
powerful than the refined Dunnett test. In most cases \r
the difference is however not very big. In order to \r
illustrate this we consider the case of comparing 9 \r
treatments with one control based on four observa\u0002tions for the control and for each treatment. The re\u0002fined Dunnett test then consists in successively com\u0002paring the ordered individual t-statistics for com\u0002paring one treatment with the control with the \r
numbers \r
1.70, 1.99, 2.15, 2.25, 2.33, 2.40, 2.45, 2.50, 2.54, \r
while the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test con\u0002sists in successively comparing the same statistics \r
with the numbers \r
1.70, 2.04, 2.23, 2.36, 2.46, 2.54, 2.60, 2.66, 2.71. \r
In the classical Dunnett test they are all compared \r
to 2.54. \r
There are two different variations of this problem, \r
where the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can \r
easily be applied, whereas the classical and the re\u0002fined Dunnett test can not so easily be applied. One \r
is the case of non-equal sample sizes. Then the classi\u0002cal Dunnett type of test requires much computation, \r
because tables are not available. The corresponding \r
closed procedure requires even more computation, \r
since a number of critical values of classical Dunnett \r
test statistics are needed. The sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test requires only a number of critical \r
values of ordinary t statistics. \r
The other variation is the case where one-sided \r
rejections are wanted. This is easily obtained by using \r
a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test and introduc\u0002ing two one-sided hypotheses for each comparison of \r
a treatment with the control. \r
For comparison of a number of treatments with \r
one control in the case of non-normal distribution a \r
many-one-rank test can be used. Such a test can be \r
refined to a corresponding sequentially rejective test \r
(equivalent to a corresponding closed test) with a \r
higher power. See Holm (1977). If the number of \r
observations are not the same for all treatments and \r
the control, computational problems arise since \r
tables are not available. These difficulties are avoided \r
if a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is used, \r
since a table for the ordinary two-sample Wilcoxon \r
test statistic is the only table needed for this test. \r
In the analysis of contingency tables the distribu\u0002tional problems connected with the construction of \r
simultaneous tests are so big that the only possibility \r
in practice is to use the Bonferroni technique. See \r
e.g. Haberman (1974) chapter four. In such cases the \r
power would be higher if the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test was used instead of a classical Bon\u0002ferroni test. Other fields where big computational \r
problems call for the use of Bonferroni technique are \r
time series analysis and analysis of multidimensional \r
distributions. \r
In all these cases as well as in others it may happen \r
that some hypotheses are more important than the \r
others, which may imply the use of higher levels of \r
significance for the most important hypotheses and \r
smaller levels of significance for the less important \r
hypotheses when the Bonferroni technique is ap\u0002plied. At a first glance it seems to be impossible to \r
obtain such an arrangement with the sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test. But this is not true, since \r
it is possible to generalise Theorem 1 to the case of \r
different weights by slightly changing the procedure. \r
Let as before H1, H2, ..., Hn, be the hypotheses to \r
be tested and R1, R2, ..., Rn be the obtained levels of \r
some suitable test statistics for those hypotheses. \r
Further let cl, c2, ..., cn be positive constants in\u0002dicating the importance of the hypotheses in the \r
sense that the constants corresponding to more im\u0002portant hypotheses are greater then those corre\u0002sponding to less important hypotheses. The precise \r
meaning of these constants will be made clear later. \r
Now introduce the statistics Sk = Rklck for k = 1, 2, \r
n, let S S') 1SS21 < ... <S(') be the ordered statistics \r
in this series, let H(l), H', ..., H'n) be the corre\u0002sponding hypotheses and let C c'2, ..., c (n) be the \r
corresponding constants. Then a generalized sequen\u0002tially rejective Bonferroni test can be described by \r
scheme 2 on the next page. \r
Theorem 2. The generalized sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test described by scheme 2 has the multiple \r
level of significance oc for free combinations. \r

From the definition of the generalized sequentially \r

it can easily be seen what role is played by the \r
constants cl, c2, ..., cn. At each step in the procedure \r
the obtained levels for the not yet rejected hypotheses \r
are compared to parts of a, which are proportional \r
to the corresponding constants. Compared to the \r
'ordinary' sequentially rejective Bonferroni test this \r
implies an increase of power for alternative to hypo\u0002theses with high values of ck at the cost of decrease \r
of power for alternatives to hypotheses with small \r
values of Ck, which is the reason of introducing the \r
generalized test. When all Ck are equal the generalized \r
test reduces to the ordinary test. \r
The previous discussion indicates a good way of \r
handling multiple test problems in complicated ap\u0002plications. One can start by choosing a number of \r
relevant hypotheses, then assign to every hypothesis \r
a suitable test statistic, whose one-dimensional distri\u0002bution is known exactly or approximately, and finally \r
direct the power towards the most important hypo\u0002theses by choosing proper constants in a generalized \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test. Of course it is \r
also a desire to have the different test statistics exactly \r
or approximately independent not for computational \r
reasons but because a good experimental design \r
requires the different hypotheses to be tested by \r
variables 'not related to each others'. \r

ABSTRACT. This paper presents a simple and widely ap\u0002plicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective \r
type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a tine until no further \r
rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed \r
level of significance protection against error of the first kind \r
for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties \r
of the test and a number of possible applications are also \r
discussed. \r

The statistical problems arising in applications often \r
involve a number of detail problems, i.e. there are \r
often a number of interesting parameters to be esti\u0002mated and/or a number of interesting hypotheses to \r
be tested. In some cases these detail problems may \r
be treated separately without any connection to each \r
other. But in most cases the detail problems are con\u0002nected to each other and the totality of solutions to \r
the detail problems are used to get a general picture. \r
In this latter case the statistician is faced with a \r
multiple statistical inference problem, where he has \r
to take into consideration that the different detail \r
problems should be treated simultaneously. \r
Multiple statistical inference has been a vital re\u0002search area within statistical inference theory the \r
past 50 years, and methods have been proposed for \r
several situations of practical interest. A good presen\u0002tation of the earlier main results is given by Miller \r
(1966). The multiple statistical inference methods are \r
separated into two main types, multiple confidence \r
interval methods and multiple test methods. \r
For multiple test procedures there has been sug\u0002gested several types of properties, which the tests \r
should have in order to give satisfactory protection \r
against wrong decisions. Some of those are based on \r
decision theoretic conceptions, while others are based \r
on probabilities of making wrong decisions. In this \r
paper we will study multiple test procedures and we \r
will use the most common type of protection against \r
error of the first kind by requiring the tests to have a \r
small probability of rejecting any true hypotheses. \r
The methodological motivation and exact definition \r
is the following. \r
Let the (detail) hypotheses in a multiple test prob\u0002lem be denoted by H1, H12, ..., Hn and the alternatives \r
to those by K., K2, ..., K,. A (non-randomized) mul\u0002tiple test procedure is a rule assigning to each out\u0002come a set of rejected hypotheses (which might be \r
empty). This means that there are also n critical \r
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn consisting of those outcomes \r
for which the corresponding hypotheses are rejected. \r
In a test of a single null hypothesis H1 against an \r
alternative K1 the size of the test is defined as the \r
supremum of the probability of the critical region C1 \r
when the hypothesis H11 is true. This probability of \r
error of the first kind is always kept at (or below) a \r
small predetermined level a. The philosophical rea\u0002son for this is that when we have made a 'discovery' \r
by rejecting the null hypothesis we can quite safely \r
claim that the null hypothesis is not true, because if \r
it was true, we should have accepted it with a \r
probability of at least 1 -oc. This also implies that \r
we do not make any 'discovery' by accepting the null \r
hypotheses, because we do not have such a protec\u0002tion against errors of the second kind. \r
In a multiple test of a number of hypotheses \r
H,, H12, ..., Hn there are a lot of possible combina\u0002tions of null hypotheses. If we want to make our \r
'discoveries' in form of rejected null hypotheses to \r
be safely claimed, we must keep the probability of \r
rejecting any true null hypotheses small, how many \r
and which the true hypotheses may be. Thus we are \r
led to the following definition \r
Definition. A multiple test procedure with critical \r
regions C1, C2, ..., Cn for testing hypotheses Hi, \r
H2, ..., H,, is said to have a multiple level of signifi\u0002cance a (for free combinations) if for any non-empty \r
index set I' {1, 2, 3, ..., n} the supremum of the \r
probability P( u iE C2) when Hi are true for all i eI \r
is smaller than or equal to a. \r
The words 'for free combinations' are put into the \r
definition in order to underline that all subsets of \r

null hypotheses could appear as the set of true hypo\u0002theses. There might be situations in which all sub\u0002sets are not allowed for some reason, for instance \r
situations where the truth of two hypotheses implies \r
the truth or falseness of a third hypothesis. It is to \r
be observed that a multiple level of significance ac for \r
some restricted combinations imposes fewer condi\u0002tions on the test procedure than a multiple level of \r
significance a for free combinations, i.e. a test proce\u0002dure with multiple level of significance x for free \r
combinations has a multiple level of significance a \r
for any type of restricted combinations. \r
In our setting the basic hypotheses H1, H2, ..., H. \r
are minimal in the sense of Gabriel (1969). This \r
means that if o,, con, ..., on are the parameter sets \r
where the hypotheses H1, H2, ..., Hn are true than \r
the only (secondary) hypotheses to be tested are the \r
hypotheses that the parameter belongs to intersec\u0002tions nf EI co, of sets coi for different index sets \r
Ic- {1, 2, ..., n}. \r
We will exclusively discuss a type of multiple test \r
procedures, which may be called sequentially rejec\u0002tive because basic hypotheses are rejected one at a \r
time according to certain rules. Thus we do not make \r
separate tests of all the (secondary) hypotheses that \r
the parameter belongs to intersections nflI wi for \r
different Ic {1, 2, ..., n}. We always consider such \r
(secondary) hypotheses to be rejected as soon as any \r
of the included basic hypotheses are rejected. \r
A test procedure is called coherent if it prevents \r
the contradiction of rejecting a hypothesis without \r
also rejecting all other hypotheses implying it. It is \r
called consonant if it avoids dissonances consisting \r
in rejecting a hypothesis and not rejecting any other \r
hypotheses implied by it. (See Gabriel, 1969, pp. 229 \r
and 231.) The sequentially rejective tests are coherent \r
and consonant by their very definition. \r
In many applications there are logical implica\u0002tions among the basic hypotheses i.e. some combina\u0002tions of falseness of different basic hypotheses are \r
not allowed because there are no possible parameter \r
points corresponding to those combinations. Then \r
we do not want the multiple test procedure to end \r
up with a statement that the parameter belongs to \r
such an empty set. This requirement has to be \r
studied separately for each kind of logical implica\u0002tion. We will consider only the type of logical im\u0002plications arising when we have two-sided alterna\u0002tives for some parameters, and want to make one\u0002sided statements. \r
The sequentially rejective multiple tests are not \r
completely new. Tests of the same type are discussed \r
by Naik (1975, p. 522), and the consonant closed \r
procedures discussed by Marcus et al. (1976, p. 656) \r
are equivalent to sequentially rejective tests. Marcus \r
et al. (1976) give one particular example of such a \r
test in an analysis of variance situation, and indicate \r
that others can be constructed. But they do not seem \r
to have thought of the simple and general procedure \r
we present in the next section, because that procedure \r
can easily be used to make one-sided rejections, \r
which they have posed as a difficult problem. Our \r
test is based on the simple Boole inequality and can \r
be applied to any parametric or non-parametric \r
model, but yet it has good power properties. It will \r
be shown by examples that it may have considerably \r
higher power than classical multiple test procedures. \r
It also has surprisingly small loss of power compared \r
to the special sequentially rejective tests (or equi\u0002valent consonant closed tests) that can be constructed \r
in different parametric models, for instance analysis \r
of variance models."""

In this section we will present a simple sequentially \r
rejective test, which is based on the Boole inequality. \r
The use of the Boole inequality within multiple in\u0002ference theory is usually called the Bonferroni tech\u0002nique, and for this reason we will call our test the \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test. \r
When the n hypotheses H,, H2, ..., Hn are tested \r
separately by using tests with the level ac/n it follows \r
immediately from the Boole inequality that the prob\u0002ability of rejecting any true hypotheses is smaller \r
then or equal to ac. This constitutes then a multiple \r
test procedure with the multiple level of significance \r
a for free combination, the classical Bonferroni \r
multiple test procedure. \r
The separate tests in the classical Bonferroni \r
multiple test are usually performed by using some test \r
statistics, which we will denote here by Y,, Y2, ..., Yn. \r
We suppose now that this is the case, and also that \r
these test statistics have a tendency of obtaining \r
greater values when the corresponding hypothesis is \r
not true. The critical level Sk(Y) for the outcome y of \r
the test statistic Yk is then equal to the supremum of \r
the probability P(Yk >y) when the hypothesis Hk is \r
true. Defining now the obtained levels Rl, R2, ..., Rn \r
by \r
Rk = dk(Yk) \r
the classical Bonferroni test can be performed by \r
comparing all the obtained levels R&, R2, ..., Rn with \r
a/n. \r
The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test will also \r
be defined by the obtained levels. Denoting by R('1 < \r
R'2' 6 ... <R(n, the ordered obtained levels and by \r
H"), H , ..., H'() the corresponding hypotheses, \r
the procedure can most easily be described by scheme \r
1, where ac, 0 <La < 1, is a fixed number. \r

The test is performed by starting at the top of the \r
scheme and going down step by step until no further \r
rejection can be done. This can happen either by \r
accepting all remaining hypotheses or rejecting the \r
last hypothesis H(n). \r
Theorem 1. The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test \r
described by scheme I has the multiple level of sig\u0002nificance a for free combinations. \r
Proof. Let I be the set of indexes of the true hypo\u0002theses. By the Boole inequality we then have \r
P Rf >- for all i e \r
m \r
=1-P(R<- for some iEl) \r
where m is the number of elements in I. But if the \r
event \r
{Ri >- for all i e I} \r
m \r
occurs then \r
.R(n + i-M)> ?:,. \r
m \r
and the sequentially rejective test stops in the step \r
n +1 - m or earlier. This implies however that all \r
hypotheses corresponding to obtained levels Ri > \r
ac/m will be accepted and this set of hypotheses in\u0002cludes the set of true hypotheses. O \r
In the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test the \r
obtained levels are compared to the numbers \r
ac ac ac \r
n' n-I' ' \r
whereas in the classical Bonferroni test they are \r
compared to a/n. This means that the probability of \r
rejecting any set of (false) hypotheses using the classi\u0002cal Bonferroni test is smaller than or equal to the \r
same probability using the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test based on the same test statistics. The \r
classical Bonferroni test has been used mainly in \r
situations where no other (more special) multiple test \r
procedure is available. It can always be replaced by \r
the corresponding sequentially rejective Bonferroni \r
test without loosing any probability of rejecting false \r
hypotheses. Except in trivial non-interesting cases \r
the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test has strictly \r
larger probability of rejecting false hypotheses and \r
thus it ought to replace the classical Bonferroni test \r
at all instants where the latter usually is applied. \r
The power gain obtained by using a sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test instead of a classical Bon\u0002ferroni test depends very much upon the alternative. \r
It is small if all the hypotheses are 'almost true', but \r
it may be considerable if a number of hypotheses are \r
'completely wrong'. If m of the n basic hypotheses \r
are 'completely wrong' the corresponding levels at\u0002tain small values, and these hypotheses are rejected \r
in the first m steps with a big probability. The \r
other levels are then compared to ac/k for k = n -m, \r
n-rm-l, n-rm -2, ..., 2, 1, which is equivalent to \r
performing a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test \r
only on those hypotheses that are not 'completely \r
wrong'. \r
A very simple example will indicate how big the \r
power gain may be. Suppose that Yk, k = 1, 2, ..., 10 \r
are independent and normally distributed with para\u0002meters Ilk and 1 for k = 1, 2, ..., 10 and that we want \r
to test the hypotheses Hk: k = 0 against the alterna\u0002tives Ilk >0 for k = 1, 2, ..., 10 at a multiple level of \r
significance 0.05. If four of the Puk's are equal to 0.0, \r
four of them are equal to 6.0 and the remaining two \r
are equal to 3.0, the classical Bonferroni test rejects \r

both the latter hypotheses with probability 0.439, \r
while the sequentially rejective Bonferroni procedure \r
rejects both with probability 0.565. \r
The great advantage with the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test (as well as with the classical Bon\u0002ferroni test) is its flexibility. There are no restrictions \r
on the type of tests, the only requirement being that \r
it should be possible to calculate the obtained level \r
for each separate test. Further there are no problems \r
in including in the analysis only the a priori interest\u0002ing hypotheses, while more special multiple tests \r
usually include all hypotheses of a certain kind. But \r
when there exist logical implications among the \r
hypotheses problems arise which we have to take in\u0002to consideration. \r
Let as before wl, w02, Ct3, ..., on denote the para\u0002meter sets where the hypotheses H1, H2, H3, ..., Hn \r
are true. Then there exists a logical implication as \r
soon as there is some index set Isuch that nieiC Oi = \r
b. In words this means that some combination of \r
falseness of the different hypotheses is not possible, \r
and the natural condition is of course that we should \r
not end up the multiple test with a statement that the \r
true parameter point is in an empty set. Each type of \r
logical implication requires a special analysis of the \r
properties of the test statistics in order to ensure that \r
the test can not end up with such statements. The \r
only type of logical implication we will consider is \r
the one arising in connection with two-sided rejec\u0002tions. \r
Let y be a (one-dimensional) parameter and sup\u0002pose that H1: y < yO and H2: y > y2o are basic hypo\u0002theses in a multiple test problem. Then C a,l n C co2 = \r
b and both these hypotheses should not be rejected \r
in the multiple test procedure. It is natural to use the \r
same test statistic to test both hypotheses and since \r
we have the convention of rejecting the hypotheses \r
for high values of the test statistics we should have \r
Y2= - Y1. Now for the outcomes Yi of Y1 and y= \r
-Yl for Y2 the obtained levels ail(yi) and A2(Y2) satisfy \r
Y2)UP P(Y2 > Y2) \r
V>Yo \r
> sup P(Y2 > Y2) = sup (1 -P(Y2 < Y2)) \r

Y=VYo \r
> 1 -sup P(Y1 > y1) \r
V=Yo \r
> 1-sup P(Y1 > Ay1)1 l(y) \r
V?Yo \r
This means that for any outcomes Yi and Y2 `Y1 \r
of Y1 and Y2 at least one of the obtained levels \r
Mi(Y,) and d2(Y2) is >, and thus both hypotheses \r
H1 and H2 can not be rejected in a sequentially rejec\u0002tive Bonferroni test (or a classical Bonferroni test) \r
for any multiple level of significance cx 6 i. \r
If there are a number of pairs of one-sided hypo\u0002theses and no logical implications beside those with\u0002in the pairs all illogical statements will still be avoided \r
if the same statistics with opposite signs are used \r
within the pairs and the multiple level of significance \r

The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can be ap\u0002plied in all situations where the classical Bonferroni \r
test is usually applied. And it ought to replace the \r
classical Bonferroni test in these cases because it \r
gives only slightly more complicated computations \r
and a non-negligable increase of power. It should \r
however be noted that the sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test can not be used to construct smaller con\u0002fidence sets than those constructed by the classical \r
Bonferroni test. This is so because the confidence \r
set consists of the parameter points that would not \r
be rejected as true parameter points in separate single \r
tests. And when a confidence set is constructed from \r
multiple tests it consists of the parameter points for \r
which none of the detail hypotheses are rejected, \r
which is in fact a special construction of a single test \r
from a multiple test. If the sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test is used in this way it is equivalent to the \r
classical Bonferroni test. \r
The great advantage of the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test (as well as the classical Bonferroni \r
test) is its computational simplicity, which arises \r
from the reduction of the distributional problems to \r
one dimension when the Boole inequality is used. The \r
same computational simplicity is obtained when the \r
test statistics are independent. It is easily seen that \r
a sequentially rejective procedure with multiple level \r
of significance a can be constructed by replacing the \r
comparison constants c/n, cx/(n -1), ..., c/1 in the \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test by 1 - (1 - c)11', \r
1 - (1 - c)1/(nl1)' ..., 1 - (1 - cc)1, which are greater. \r
This means that we get a more powerful test, but the \r
increase in power is not very big. Among the \r
numerous possible applications of the sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test we will next mention a few. \r
The problem of comparing several treatments with \r
one control have been studied by several authors. \r
For the case of normally distributed observations the \r
multiple test procedure suggested by Dunnett (1955) \r
is commonly used. It requires the same number of \r
Scand J Statist 6 

Sequentially rejective multiple test 69 \r
observations for all treatments, and it is based on \r
the assumption that the variance is the same for the \r
control and all treatments. Marcus et al. (1976) have \r
proposed a closed test procedure, which is a refine\u0002ment of the Dunnett procedure and which is more \r
powerful. Their procedure is equivalent to a sequenti\u0002ally rejective procedure presented in Holm (1977). \r
The sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can also \r
be used in this situation although it is of course less \r
powerful than the refined Dunnett test. In most cases \r
the difference is however not very big. In order to \r
illustrate this we consider the case of comparing 9 \r
treatments with one control based on four observa\u0002tions for the control and for each treatment. The re\u0002fined Dunnett test then consists in successively com\u0002paring the ordered individual t-statistics for com\u0002paring one treatment with the control with the \r
numbers \r
1.70, 1.99, 2.15, 2.25, 2.33, 2.40, 2.45, 2.50, 2.54, \r
while the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test con\u0002sists in successively comparing the same statistics \r
with the numbers \r
1.70, 2.04, 2.23, 2.36, 2.46, 2.54, 2.60, 2.66, 2.71. \r
In the classical Dunnett test they are all compared \r
to 2.54. \r
There are two different variations of this problem, \r
where the sequentially rejective Bonferroni test can \r
easily be applied, whereas the classical and the re\u0002fined Dunnett test can not so easily be applied. One \r
is the case of non-equal sample sizes. Then the classi\u0002cal Dunnett type of test requires much computation, \r
because tables are not available. The corresponding \r
closed procedure requires even more computation, \r
since a number of critical values of classical Dunnett \r
test statistics are needed. The sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test requires only a number of critical \r
values of ordinary t statistics. \r
The other variation is the case where one-sided \r
rejections are wanted. This is easily obtained by using \r
a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test and introduc\u0002ing two one-sided hypotheses for each comparison of \r
a treatment with the control. \r
For comparison of a number of treatments with \r
one control in the case of non-normal distribution a \r
many-one-rank test can be used. Such a test can be \r
refined to a corresponding sequentially rejective test \r
(equivalent to a corresponding closed test) with a \r
higher power. See Holm (1977). If the number of \r
observations are not the same for all treatments and \r
the control, computational problems arise since \r
tables are not available. These difficulties are avoided \r
if a sequentially rejective Bonferroni test is used, \r
since a table for the ordinary two-sample Wilcoxon \r
test statistic is the only table needed for this test. \r
In the analysis of contingency tables the distribu\u0002tional problems connected with the construction of \r
simultaneous tests are so big that the only possibility \r
in practice is to use the Bonferroni technique. See \r
e.g. Haberman (1974) chapter four. In such cases the \r
power would be higher if the sequentially rejective \r
Bonferroni test was used instead of a classical Bon\u0002ferroni test. Other fields where big computational \r
problems call for the use of Bonferroni technique are \r
time series analysis and analysis of multidimensional \r
distributions. \r
In all these cases as well as in others it may happen \r
that some hypotheses are more important than the \r
others, which may imply the use of higher levels of \r
significance for the most important hypotheses and \r
smaller levels of significance for the less important \r
hypotheses when the Bonferroni technique is ap\u0002plied. At a first glance it seems to be impossible to \r
obtain such an arrangement with the sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test. But this is not true, since \r
it is possible to generalise Theorem 1 to the case of \r
different weights by slightly changing the procedure. \r
Let as before H1, H2, ..., Hn, be the hypotheses to \r
be tested and R1, R2, ..., Rn be the obtained levels of \r
some suitable test statistics for those hypotheses. \r
Further let cl, c2, ..., cn be positive constants in\u0002dicating the importance of the hypotheses in the \r
sense that the constants corresponding to more im\u0002portant hypotheses are greater then those corre\u0002sponding to less important hypotheses. The precise \r
meaning of these constants will be made clear later. \r
Now introduce the statistics Sk = Rklck for k = 1, 2, \r
n, let S S') 1SS21 < ... <S(') be the ordered statistics \r
in this series, let H(l), H', ..., H'n) be the corre\u0002sponding hypotheses and let C c'2, ..., c (n) be the \r
corresponding constants. Then a generalized sequen\u0002tially rejective Bonferroni test can be described by \r
scheme 2 on the next page. \r
Theorem 2. The generalized sequentially rejective Bon\u0002ferroni test described by scheme 2 has the multiple \r
level of significance oc for free combinations. \r
Proof. Let I be the set of indexes for the true \r
hypotheses. By the Boole inequality we have \r
P(Si >- \r

which implies that the procedure will stop in step v \r
or earlier and that all true hypotheses will be ac\u0002cepted. E \r
From the definition of the generalized sequentially \r
rejective Bonferroni test and the proof of Theorem 2 \r
it can easily be seen what role is played by the \r
constants cl, c2, ..., cn. At each step in the procedure \r
the obtained levels for the not yet rejected hypotheses \r
are compared to parts of a, which are proportional \r
to the corresponding constants. Compared to the \r
'ordinary' sequentially rejective Bonferroni test this \r
implies an increase of power for alternative to hypo\u0002theses with high values of ck at the cost of decrease \r
of power for alternatives to hypotheses with small \r
values of Ck, which is the reason of introducing the \r
generalized test. When all Ck are equal the generalized \r
test reduces to the ordinary test. \r
The previous discussion indicates a good way of \r
handling multiple test problems in complicated ap\u0002plications. One can start by choosing a number of \r
relevant hypotheses, then assign to every hypothesis \r
a suitable test statistic, whose one-dimensional distri\u0002bution is known exactly or approximately, and finally \r
direct the power towards the most important hypo\u0002theses by choosing proper constants in a generalized \r
sequentially rejective Bonferroni test. Of course it is \r
also a desire to have the different test statistics exactly \r
or approximately independent not for computational \r
reasons but because a good experimental design \r
requires the different hypotheses to be tested by \r
variables 'not related to each others'. \r
