ON THE SPECTRAL CHARACTERIZATION OF MANIFOLDS\r
ALAIN CONNES\r
Abstract. We show that the first five of the axioms we had formulated on\r
spectral triples suffice (in a slightly stronger form) to characterize the spectral\r
triples associated to smooth compact manifolds. The algebra, which is assumed\r
to be commutative, is shown to be isomorphic to the algebra of all smooth\r
functions on a unique smooth oriented compact manifold, while the operator\r
is shown to be of Dirac type and the metric to be Riemannian.\r

1. Introduction\r
The problem of spectral characterization of manifolds was initially formulated as\r
an open question in [11]. The issue is to show that under the simple conditions\r
of [11] on a spectral triple (A, H, D), with A commutative, the algebra A is the\r
algebra C∞(X) of smooth functions on a (unique) smooth compact manifold X.\r
The five conditions ([11]), in dimension p, are\r
(1) The n-th characteristic value of the resolvent of D is O(n\r
−1/p).\r
(2) [[D, a], b] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.\r
(3) For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for any integer\r
m where δ is the derivation: δ(T ) = [|D|, T ].\r
(4) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zp(A, A) such that πD(c) = 1 for p\r
odd, while for p even, πD(c) = γ is a Z/2 grading.\r
(5) Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ = ∩DomDm is finite and projective.\r
Moreover the following equality defines a hermitian structure ( | ) on this\r
module: hξ, a ηi =\r
R\r
− a(ξ|η)|D|\r
−p\r
, ∀a ∈ A, ∀ξ, η ∈ H∞.\r
The notations are recalled at the beginning of §2 below. The strategy of proof was\r
outlined briefly in [11]. It consists in using the components a\r
j\r
α (j > 0) of the cycle\r
c =\r
Pa\r
0\r
α ⊗a\r
1\r
α ⊗· · ·⊗a\r
p\r
α as tentative local charts. There are three basic difficulties:\r
a) Show that the spectrum X of A is large enough so that the range of “local\r
charts” aα contains an open set in R\r
p\r
.\r
b) Show that the joint spectral measure of the components a\r
j\r
α (j > 0) of a\r
“local chart” is the Lebesgue measure.\r
c) Apply the basic inequality ([8], [9], Proposition IV.3.14) giving an upper\r
bound on the Voiculescu obstruction [25] and use [25] Theorem 4.5 to show\r
that the “local charts” are locally injective.\r
In a recent paper [22], Rennie and Varilly considered the above challenging problem.\r
The paper [22] is a courageous attempt which contains a number of interesting\r
ideas and a useful smooth calculus but also, unfortunately, several gaps, each being\r
enough to invalidate the proof of the claimed result.\r
I will show in this paper how to prove a), b), c). I have tried to be very careful\r
and give detailed proofs. The way to prove a) uses a new ingredient: the implicit\r
function theorem (whose presence is not a real surprise). We shall first assume that\r
continuous ∗-derivations of A exponentiate, i.e. are generators of one-parameter\r
groups (of automorphisms of A). Then most of the work, done in §§5, 6, is to show\r
that this hypothesis can be removed. In this very technical part of the paper we\r
show that enough self-adjoint derivations of A exponentiate. We first prove in §5\r
that enough derivations are dissipative for the C\r
∗\r
-algebra norm. We then proceed\r
in §6 and use the self-adjointness of D and the third condition (regularity) in the\r
strong form, to show the surjectivity of the resolvent, and apply the Hille-Yosida\r
Theorem to integrate these derivations into one-parameter groups of automorphisms\r
of the C\r
∗\r
-algebra. We then show that they are continuous for the Sobolev norms\r
and define automorphisms of A.\r
To prove b) one needs a key result which is the analogue in our context of the quasi\u0002invariance under diffeomorphisms of the smooth measure class on a manifold, whose\r
replacement in our case is given by the Dixmier trace. This is shown in Proposition\r
6.16 at the end of §6. We then prove in §7 the required absolute continuity of the\r
2

spectral measure using a smearing argument. In §8 we show the required inequality\r
between the multiplicity of the map sα and the spectral multiplicity of the a\r
j\r
α.\r
To prove c) a new strategy is required. Roughly one needs to know that the multi\u0002plicity function of a tentative local coordinate system is locally bounded while the\r
information one obtains just by applying the strategy outlined in [11] (and pursued\r
in [22]) is that it is a lower semicontinuous1integrable function. Typical examples\r
of Lebesgue negligible dense Gδ sets2show that, as such, the situation is hopeless.\r
In order to solve this problem, one needs a local form of the basic inequality ([8],\r
[9], Proposition IV.3.14) giving an upper bound on the Voiculescu obstruction. We\r
prove this result in §9. This key result is combined with Voiculescu’s Theorem\r
(Theorem 4.5 of [25]) and with the initial implicit function technique to conclude\r
the proof in §11. Our main result can be stated as follows (cf. Theorem 11.3):\r
Theorem 1.1. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple, with A commutative, fulfilling\r
the first five conditions of [11] (cf. §2) in a slightly stronger form i.e. we assume\r
that:\r
• The regularity holds for all A-endomorphisms of ∩DomDm.\r
• The Hochschild cycle c is antisymmetric.\r
Then there exists a compact oriented smooth manifold X such that A is the algebra\r
C∞(X) of smooth functions on X.\r
Moreover every compact oriented smooth manifold appears in this spectral manner.\r
Our next result is the following variant (Theorem 11.5):\r
Theorem 1.2. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple with A commutative, fulfilling the\r
first five conditions of [11] (cf. §2) with the cycle c antisymmetric. Assume that the\r
multiplicity of the action of A′′ in H is 2\r
p/2\r
. Then there exists a smooth oriented\r
compact (spinc) manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
This multiplicity hypothesis is a weak form of the Poincar´e duality condition 6 of\r
[11] and thus the above theorem can be seen as the solution of the original problem\r
formulated in [11] and gives a characterization of spinc manifolds. It follows from\r
[11] (cf. [14] for the proof) that the operator D is then a Dirac operator. The reality\r
condition selects spin manifolds among spinc, and the spectral action ([3]) selects\r
the Levi-Civita connection.\r
Finally we make a few remarks in §12. The first describes a different perspective on\r
our main result. As explained many times, it is only because one drops commuta\u0002tivity that variables with continuous range can coexist with infinitesimal variables\r
(which only affect finitely many values larger than a given ǫ). In the classical\r
formulation of variables, as maps from a set X to the real numbers, infinitesimal\r
variables cannot coexist with continuous variables. The formalism of quantum\r
mechanics and the uniqueness of the separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space\r
cure this problem. Using this formalism, variables with continuous range (i.e. self\u0002adjoint operators with continuous spectrum) coexist, in the same operator theoretic\r
framework, with variables with countable range, such as the infinitesimal ones (i.e.\r
compact operators). The only new fact is that they do not commute. The content\r
of Theorem 1.2 can be expressed in a suggestive manner from this coexistence be\u0002tween the continuum and the discrete. We fix the integer p and N = 2[p/2] where\r
1\r
the inverse image of ]a,∞] is open\r
2\r
countable intersection of open sets\r
3

[p/2] is the integral part of p/2. The continuum will only be used through its “mea\u0002sure theoretic” content. This is captured by a commutative von-Neumann algebra\r
M and, provided there is no atomic part in M, this algebra is then unique (up to\r
isomorphism). It is uniquely represented in Hilbert space H (which we fix once and\r
for all, as a universal stage) once the spectral multiplicity is fixed equal to N. Thus\r
the pair (M, H) is unique (up to isomorphism). Let us now consider (separately\r
first) an infinitesimal ds i.e. a self-adjoint compact operator in H. Equivalently\r
we can talk about its inverse D which is unbounded and self-adjoint. We assume\r
that ds is an infinitesimal of finite order α =\r
1\r
p\r
. The information contained in the\r
operator ds is entirely captured by a list of real numbers, namely the eigenvalues\r
of ds (with their multiplicity). This list determines uniquely (up to isomorphism)\r
the pair (H, D). Theorem 1.2 can now be restated as the birth of a geometry\r
from the coexistence of (M, H) with (H, D). This coexistence is encoded by a uni\u0002tary isomorphism F between the Hilbert space of the canonical pair (M, H) and\r
the Hilbert space of the canonical pair (H, D). Thus the full information on the\r
geometric space is subdivided in two pieces\r
(1) The list of eigenvalues of D.\r
(2) The unitary F.\r
We point out in §12 the analogy between these parameters for geometry and the\r
parameters of the Yukawa coupling of the Standard Model ([6]) which are encoded\r
similarly by:\r
(1) The list of masses.\r
(2) The CKM matrix C.\r
This analogy as well as the precise definition of the corresponding unitary invariant\r
of Riemannian geometry will be dealt with in details in the companion paper [12].\r
The second remark recalls a result of M. Hilsum on finite propagation (cf. [17]).\r
We then discuss briefly in §12 the variations dealing with real analytic manifolds,\r
non-integral dimensions and the non-commutative case.\r
We end with two appendices. In the first, §13, we discuss equivalent formulations\r
of the regularity condition. In the second, §14, we recall the basic properties of the\r
Dixmier trace and its relation with the heat expansion.\r

2. Preliminaries\r
Let us recall the conditions for commutative geometry as formulated in [11]. We\r
shall only use the first five conditions.\r
We let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple, thus H is a Hilbert space, A an involutive\r
algebra represented in H and D is a selfadjoint operator in H. We assume that\r
A is commutative. We are given an integer p which controls the dimension of our\r
space. The conditions are:\r
1) Dimension: The n-th characteristic value of the resolvent of D is O(n\r
−1/p).\r
2) Order one: [[D, f], g] = 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A.\r
We let δ(T ) = [|D|, T ] be the commutator3 with the absolute value of D:\r
3The domain of δ is the set of bounded operators T with T Dom|D| ⊂ Dom|D| and δ(T)\r
bounded.\r
4

3) Regularity: For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m.\r
We let πD be the linear map given by\r
(1) πD(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ap\r
) = a\r
0\r
[D, a1] . . . [D, ap] , ∀a\r
j ∈ A .\r
4) Orientability: There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zp(A, A) such that πD(c) = 1\r
for p odd, while for p even, πD(c) = γ satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γD = −Dγ .\r
5) Finiteness and absolute continuity:Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ =\r
∩m Domain Dm is finite and projective. Moreover the following equality defines a\r
hermitian structure ( | ) on this module,\r
(2) hξ, a ηi =\r
Z\r
− a(ξ|η)|D|\r
−p ∀ a ∈ A , ∀ ξ, η ∈ H∞ .\r
In other words the module can be written as H∞ = eAn with e = e\r
∗ ∈ Mn(A)\r
defining the Hermitian structure so that\r
(3) (ξ|η) = Xξ\r
∗\r
i\r
ηi ∈ A , ∀ξ, η ∈ eA\r
n\r
It follows from condition 4) and from4([9], Theorem 8, IV.2.γ, and [14]) that the\r
operators a |D|\r
−p\r
, a ∈ A are measurable ([9], Definition 7, IV.2.β) so that the\r
coefficient R− a |D|\r
−p of the logarithmic divergence of their trace is unambiguously\r
defined.\r
It follows from condition 5) that the algebra A is uniquely determined inside its\r
weak closure A′′ (which is also the bicommutant of A in H) by the equality\r
A = {T ∈ A′′ ; T ∈ ∩m>0 Domδ\r
m} .\r
This was stated without proof in [11] and we give the argument below:\r
Lemma 2.1. The following conditions are equivalent for T ∈ A′′:\r
(1) T ∈ A\r
(2) [D, T ] is bounded and both T and [D, T ] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m\r
(3) T belongs to the domain of δ\r
m, for any integer m\r
(4) T H∞ ⊂ H∞\r
Proof. Let us assume the fourth property. Then T defines an endomorphism of\r
the finite projective module H∞ = eAn over A. As any endomorphism T is of the\r
form,\r
(4) T = e[aij ]e , aij ∈ A\r
i.e. it is the compression of a matrix a = [aij ] ∈ Mn(A).\r
Let us show that since T belongs to the weak closure of A one can choose aij = xδij\r
for some element x of A. The norm closure A of A in L(H) is a commutative C\r
∗\r
-\r
algebra, A = C(X) for some compact space X, and since A is a subalgebra of L(H)\r
it injects in A. The following equality\r
(5) λ(f) = Z−f|D|\r
−p\r
, ∀f ∈ A,\r
4We shall not use this result in an essential manner since one can just fix a choice of Dixmier\r
trace Trω throughout the proof.\r
5

defines a positive measure λ on X. We let E = eAn be the induced finite projective\r
module over A, which is intrinsically defined as E = H∞ ⊗A A. We let S be the\r
hermitian vector bundle on X such that E = C(X, S). By the absolute continuity\r
relation (2), the representation of A = C(X) in H is obtained from its action in\r
L\r
2\r
(X, λ) by the tensor product\r
(6) H = E ⊗A L\r
2\r
(X, λ) = eL2(X, λ)\r
n = L2\r
(X, λ, S).\r
This shows that the weak closure A′′ = A′′ of A in H is given by the diagonal\r
action of L∞(X, λ) in eL2(X, λ)\r
n. Thus, since T ∈ A′′, there exists f ∈ L∞(X, λ)\r
such that T = ef. It follows that the matrix eae belongs to the center of eMn(A)e.\r
This center is e(1 ⊗ A) and thus T agrees with an element of A which proves the\r
implication 4) ⇒ 1). To be more specific, and for later use, let us give a formula\r
for an element x ∈ A such that T = ex in term of the matrix elements tij ∈ A of\r
T = e[aij ]e. First the fact that T belongs to the center of the algebra B = eMn(A)e\r
of endomorphisms of H∞ can be seen directly since any such endomorphism S is\r
automatically continuous in H using (6). Thus since T ∈ A′′ one has ST = TS.\r
Since\r
P\r
e is a self-adjoint idempotent and A injects in C(X) the element τ = Tr(e) =\r
ejj ∈ A is determined by its image in A which is just the function χ ∈ X 7→\r
dimSχ ∈ {0, 1, . . ., n}. This determines n + 1 self-adjoint idempotents pj ∈ A by\r
(7) τ = Tr(e) = Xj pj\r
Xpj = 1 .\r
To check that pj ∈ A it is enough to show that pj = Pj (τ) where Pj is a polynomial\r
with\r
(8) Pj (k) = 0 , ∀k 6= j , 0 ≤ k ≤ n , Pj (j) = 1 .\r
One then has the following formula5for x:\r
(9) x = (Xtii)\r
X\r
j>0\r
1\r
j\r
pj ∈ A .\r
As T belongs to the center of eMn(C(X))e one gets an equality T = ef for f ∈\r
C(X) and working at every point χ ∈ X one then shows that T = ex.\r
The implication 1) ⇒ 2) follows from the regularity, and 2) ⇒ 3) is immediate. To\r
show the implication 3) ⇒ 4) one uses the definition of H∞ as the intersection of\r
domains of powers of |D| and the implication\r
T ∈ Dom δ\r
m , ξ ∈ Dom |D|m ⇒ Tξ ∈ Dom |D|m\r
with the formula\r

which is proved by induction on m. More precisely this gives an estimate of the\r
norms but one has to care for the domains and proceed as follows. By definition\r
any T ∈ Domδ preserves the domain Dom|D| thus one gets (10) for m = 1. Let\r
now T ∈ Domδ\r
2\r
i.e. T ∈ Domδ and δ(T ) ∈ Domδ. Let ξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
2\r
. Then\r
since T ∈ Dom δ and |D|ξ ∈ Dom|D|, one has T |D|ξ ∈ Dom|D|. One has δ(T )ξ =\r
|D|Tξ−T |D|ξ where both terms make sense separately. Since δ(T ) ∈ Domδ one has\r
δ(T )Dom|D| ⊂ Dom|D|. Thus δ(T )ξ ∈ Dom|D|. Hence |D|Tξ = δ(T )ξ + T |D|ξ ∈\r
5Note that p0 = 0 because of the faithfulness of the action of A in Hilbert space together with\r
condition 5.\r

Dom|D| so that T preserves Dom|D|\r
2\r
. Moreover one gets (10) for m = 2 as an\r
equality valid on any vector ξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
2\r
. One can now proceed by induction on\r
m. We assume to have shown,\r
• For q ≤ m, S ∈ Domδ\r
q ⇒ SDom|D|q ⊂ Dom|D|q\r
• (10) holds for all n ≤ m.\r
For T ∈ Domδ\r
m+1 and ξ ∈ Dom|D|m+1, one has ξ ∈ Dom|D|m and one can use\r
the induction hypothesis to get\r
|D|\r
mTξ =\r

Let us show that δ\r

m−k\r
ξ ∈ Dom|D|. One has δ\r
k\r
(T ) ∈ Domδ\r
m+1−k ⊂ Domδ\r
and |D|\r
m−k\r
ξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
1+k ⊂ Dom|D| which gives the result. Thus each term of\r
the sum belongs to Dom|D| and one has\r
|D|\r
m+1Tξ =\r
Xm\r

\u0012\r
m\r

\u0013\r
|D|δ\r

Moreover, as δ\r
k\r
(T ) ∈ Domδ and |D|\r
m−k\r
ξ ∈ Dom|D| one has\r
|D|δ\r
k\r
(T )|D|\r
m−k\r
ξ = δ\r
k+1(T )|D|m−k\r
ξ + δ\r
k\r

m−k+1ξ\r
which gives (10) for n + 1. \u0003\r
This shows that the whole geometric data (A, H, D) is in fact uniquely determined\r
by the triple (A′′, H, D) where A′′ is a commutative von Neumann algebra.\r
This also shows that A is a pre-C\r
∗\r
-algebra, i.e. that it is stable under the holo\u0002morphic functional calculus in the C\r
∗\r
-algebra norm closure of A, A = A. Since we\r
assumed that A was commutative, so is A and by Gelfand’s theorem A = C(X)\r
is the algebra of continuous complex valued functions on X = Spec(A). We note\r
finally that characters χ of A are automatically self-adjoint: χ(a\r
∗\r
) = χ(a) since\r
the spectrum of self-adjoint elements of A is real. Also they are automatically\r
continuous since the C\r
∗\r
-norm is uniquely determined algebraically by\r
kak = sup{|λ| | a\r
∗\r
a − λ\r
2 ∈ A/−1\r
}\r
thus they extend automatically to A by continuity so that\r
SpecA = SpecA .\r
We shall now show that A is a Frechet algebra i.e. a complete locally convex algebra\r
whose topology is defined by the submultiplicative norms\r
(11) pk(xy) ≤ pk(x)pk(y), ∀x, y ∈ A\r
associated to the regularity condition, for instance by\r
(12) pk(x) = kρk(x)k , ρk(x) =\r
\r
\r
x δ(x) . . . δk(x)/k!\r
0 x . . . . . .\r
. . . . . . x δ(x)\r
0 . . . 0 x\r
\r
\r
since ρk is a representation of A.\r
Proposition 2.2. (1) The unbounded derivation δ is a closed operator in L(H).\r
(2) The algebra A endowed with the norms pk is a Frechet algebra.\r
7

(3) The semi-norms pk([D, a]) = p\r
′\r
k\r
(a) are continuous.\r
Proof. (1) Let G(|D|) be the graph of |D|. The graph of δ is\r
G(δ) = {(T, S) ∈ L(H)\r
2\r
| (Tξ, Tη + Sξ) ∈ G(|D|), ∀(ξ, η) ∈ G(|D|)} .\r
It is therefore closed.\r
(2) Let us show that A is complete. Let an ∈ A be a sequence which is a Cauchy\r
sequence in any of the norms pk. Then an → T in norm, so that T ∈ A ⊂ A′′. Since\r
δ is a closed operator one has T ∈ Domδ and δ(an) → δ(T ) in norm. By induction\r
one gets, using the closedness of δ that T ∈ Domδ\r
k and δk\r
(T ) = lim δ\r
k\r
(an). Thus\r
T ∈ ∩Domδ\r
m and by Lemma 2.1, we get T ∈ A. Furthermore we also have the\r
norm convergence δ\r
k\r
(T ) = lim δ\r
k\r
(an). This shows that the an converge to T in the\r
topology of the norms pk and hence that A is a Frechet space.\r
(3) Let us show that if we adjoin the semi-norms p\r
′\r
k\r
to the topology of A we still get\r
a complete space. The argument of the proof of (1) only uses the closedness of the\r
operator |D| and thus we get in the same way that the derivation T → d(T ) = [D, T ]\r
with domain Domd = {T ∈ L(H)| TDomD ⊂ DomD , k[D, T ]k < ∞} is closed for\r
the norm topology of L(H). Thus the above proof of completeness applies. The\r
result then follows from the open mapping Theorem ([24] Corollary 2.12) applied\r
to the identity map from A endowed with the topology of the pk, p\r
′\r
k\r
to A endowed\r
with the topology of the pk. \u0003\r
In fact Lemma 2.1 shows that one has Sobolev estimates, using finitely many gen\u0002erators ηµ of the A-module H∞ to define the Sobolev norms on A as\r
(13) kak\r

, ∀a ∈ A\r
One has\r
Proposition 2.3. (1) When endowed with the norms (13), A is a Frechet sep\u0002arable nuclear space.\r
(2) One has Sobolev estimates of the form\r
(14) pk(a) ≤ ckkak\r

with ck < ∞, c\r
′\r
k < ∞ and suitable sequences sk > 0, s\r
′\r
k > 0.\r
(3) The spectrum X = Spec(A) is metrizable.\r
(4) Any T ∈ EndAH∞ is continuous in H∞ and extends continuously to a\r
bounded operator in H.\r
(5) The algebraic isomorphism H∞ = eAn is topological.\r
(6) The map (a, ξ) 7→ aξ and the A-valued inner product are jointly continuous\r
A × H∞ → H∞ and H∞ × H∞ → A.\r
Proof. 1) By construction the family (13) is an increasing sequence of norms. Let\r
us show that A is complete. Let an be a sequence of elements of A such that the\r
vectors (1 + D2)\r
s/2anηµ converge for all s (and all µ). We then obtain vectors\r
ζµ = lim anηµ ∈ H∞ , ∀µ ,\r
where the convergence holds in the topology of H∞. Let then T be the operator\r
given by\r
(15) Tξ = lim anξ , ∀ξ ∈ H∞ .\r

It is well defined since one can write ξ =\r
Pb\r
µηµ with bµ\r
P\r
∈ A which gives anξ =\r
b\r
µanηµ which converges, in the topology of H∞, to Pbµζµ since the bµ are\r
continuous linear maps on H∞ using (10) and regularity. Thus T is a linear map\r
on H∞ and it commutes with A i.e. it is an endomorphism of this finite projective\r
module. Thus T is of the form (4) and in particular it is bounded in H. Also since\r
endomorphisms of the finite projective module are automatically continuous in H\r
they commute with T using (15). Thus the argument of Lemma 2.1 shows that\r
T ∈ A. Moreover, since the convergence (15) holds in the topology of H∞, one has\r
an → T in the Sobolev topology and A is complete in that topology. Thus A is a\r
Frechet space. It is by construction a closed subspace of the sum of finitely many\r
spaces H∞ each being a separable nuclear space (of sequences of rapid decay). Thus\r
it is a separable nuclear space.\r
2) The identity map from the Frechet algebra A with the norms pk to the Frechet\r
space A with the Sobolev topology, is continuous (using (10)) and surjective. Hence\r
the open mapping Theorem ([24] Corollary 2.12) asserts that it is an open mapping.\r
This shows that the inverse map is continuous which gives the required estimates\r
for the norms pk. The result for the semi-norms pk([D, a]) follows from Proposition\r
2.2.\r
3) Since A is a Frechet separable nuclear space there is a sequence xn ∈ A which\r
is dense in any of the continuous norms and in particular using 2) in the p0 norm.\r
This shows that the C\r
∗\r
-algebra A is norm separable and hence that its spectrum\r
is metrizable.\r
4) By hypothesis T being an endomorphism is of the form (4). Using the inclusion\r
A ⊂ A = C(X) of A in its norm closure, we can view T as an endomorphism of the\r
induced C\r
∗\r
-module E over A. By (6), any element of EndA(E) defines a bounded\r
operator in H. This shows that the graph of the operator T in H∞ × H∞ is closed\r
and hence by the closed graph theorem that T is continuous in the Frechet topology\r
of H∞.\r
5) The product A × A → A is jointly continuous using the submultiplicative norms\r
pk of (12). This shows that eAn is a closed subspace of An and hence is complete.\r
Moreover the map (aj ) 7→\r
Paj ξj for given ξj ∈ H∞ is continuous from An to H∞\r
using (10). Thus the open mapping theorem gives the result.\r
6) Follows from 5) and the joint continuity of the product A × A → A. \u0003\r
We end this section with the stability of A under the smooth functional calculus\r
as shown in [22] Proposition 2.8. We repeat the proof for convenience.\r
Proposition 2.4. Let aj = a\r
∗\r
j\r
be n self-adjoint elements of A and f : R\r
n 7→ C be\r
a smooth function defined on a neighborhood of the joint spectrum of the aj . Then\r
the element f(a1, . . . , an) ∈ A belongs to A ⊂ A.\r
Proof. Let us first show that for a = a\r
∗ ∈ A one has for any k ∈ N,\r
(16) kδ\r

where Sℓ = {(uj)| 0 ≤ u1 ≤ . . . ≤ uℓ ≤ 1} is the standard simplex. This gives\r
(16). Now the joint spectrum K ⊂ R\r
n of the aj is a compact subset and one can\r
extend f to a smooth function with compact support f ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(R\r

f(a1, . . ., an) ∈ A is then given by\r

where ˆf is the Fourier transform of f and is a Schwartz function ˆf ∈ S(R\r

). By\r
(16) the integral (19) is convergent in any of the norms pk which define the topology\r
of A and one gets f(a1, . . ., an) ∈ A. \u0003\r
3. Openness Lemma\r
In this section, we use the standard implicit function theorem for smooth maps\r
R\r
p → Rp\r
to obtain the openness of the tentative local charts. We formulate the\r
Lemma in a rather abstract manner below and use it concretely in §7 for the local\r
charts.\r
As above and in [22], we let A be a Frechet pre-C\r
∗\r
-algebra. We recall, for involutive\r
algebras, the reality condition which defines a ∗-derivation:\r
(20) δ0(a\r
∗\r
) = δ0(a)\r
∗\r
, ∀a ∈ A .\r
We let DerA be the Lie algebra of continuous ∗-derivations of A.\r
Definition 3.1. Let A be a Frechet pre-C\r
∗\r
-algebra. A continuous ∗-derivation\r
δ0 ∈ DerA exponentiates iff one has a unique solution, depending continuously on\r
(t, a) ∈ R × A, of the differential equation:\r
(21) ∂t y(t, a) = δ0(y(t, a)), y(0, a) = a .\r
We say that A is expable when any continuous ∗-derivation δ0 ∈ DerA exponenti\u0002ates.\r
We shall show in §§5, 6 that in our context enough derivations exponentiate but\r
for clarity of the argument we shall first assume that the algebra A is expable.\r
We refer to [16] §I.3 for the discussion of differentiability in the context of Frechet\r
spaces. We just recall that a map y : F → G of Frechet spaces is of class C\r
1 when\r
the following directional derivative exists and is a jointly continuous function of\r
(x, h) ∈ F × F,\r
(22) Dy(x, h) = limǫ→0\r
1\r
ǫ\r
(y(x + ǫh) − y(x))\r
The map is of class C\r
n when the higher derivatives Dky(x, h1, . . . , hk) which are\r
defined by iteration of (22) exist and are jointly continuous functions for k ≤ n.\r
The map is smooth (or of class C∞) iff it is of class C\r
n\r
for all n.\r
10

Proposition 3.2. One has for any a, b ∈ A,\r
(23) y(t, ab) = y(t, a)y(t, b), y(t, a∗) = y(t, a)\r
∗\r
, y(t, a + b) = y(t, a) + y(t, b).\r
(24) y(t1 + t2, a) = y(t1, y(t2, a)), y(t, δ0(a)) = δ0(y(t, a)).\r
Moreover y(t, a) is a smooth function of (t, a) with n-th derivative given by\r
(25) Dny(t, a, s1, h1, . . ., sn, hn) = δ\r
n\r

y(t, hi)\r
Y\r
j6=i\r
sj .\r
Proof. The two equalities (23) and (24) follow from the uniqueness of the solution.\r
To prove (25) we consider the Frechet spaces F = R × A and G = A and compute\r
the first derivative Dy. One has\r
y(t + ǫs, a + ǫh) − y(t, a) = y(t + ǫs, a) − y(t, a) + ǫy(t + ǫs, h)\r
so that\r
Dy(t, a, s, h) = sδ0(y(t, a)) + y(t, h)\r
Since by (24) one has δ\r
k\r
0\r
(y(t, a)) = y(t, δk\r
0\r
(a)) for all k, one gets (25) by induction\r
on n. \u0003\r
The Taylor expansion at (t, a) is thus of the form\r
y(t + s, a + h) ∼\r
X(δ\r
k\r
0\r
(y(t, a))s\r
k + δk\r
0\r
(y(t, h))s\r

Lemma 3.3. Let A be commutative, and a = (a\r
j\r
) be p self-adjoint elements of A.\r
Let χ be a character of A. Assume that there exits p derivations δj ∈ DerA such\r
that\r
• Each δj exponentiates.\r
• The determinant of the matrix χ(δj (a\r
k\r
)) does not vanish.\r
Then the image under a of any neighborhood of χ in the spectrum Spec(A) of A\r
contains a neighborhood of a(χ) in R\r
p\r
.\r
Proof. By hypothesis the derivations δj ∈ DerA can be exponentiated to the corre\u0002sponding one parameter groups F\r
j\r
(t) ∈ Aut(A) of automorphisms of A. Note that\r
the flows F\r
j do not commute pairwise in general. We then define a map h from Rp\r
to Spec(A) by\r
h = χ ◦ σ , σ(t1,...,tp) = F\r
1\r
t1\r
◦ . . . ◦ F\r
p\r
tp\r
which defines a character since F\r
j\r
(t) ∈ Aut(A) by (23). The map h is continuous\r
since the topology of Spec(A) is the weak topology and for any a ∈ A the map\r
(t1, . . . , tp) ∈ R\r
p\r
7→ σ(t1,...,tp)(a) is continuous using Definition 3.1. The coordinates\r
of the map φ = a ◦ h, from R\r
p\r
to R\r
p\r
, are given by\r
φ\r
k\r
(t1, . . ., tp) = h(t1, . . . , tp)(a\r
k\r
) = χ ◦ F\r
1\r
t1\r
◦ . . . ◦ F\r
p\r
tp\r
(a\r
k\r
)\r
The map\r
(t1, . . . , tp) ∈ R\r
p\r
7→ F\r
1\r
t1\r
◦ . . . ◦ F\r
p\r
tp\r
(a\r
k\r
)\r
is a smooth map from R\r
p\r
to A. Indeed the maps (t, a) 7→ F\r
j\r
t\r
(a) are smooth, and\r
composition of smooth maps are smooth (cf. [16] Theorem 3.6.4), while the above\r
map is the composition:\r
(26) F\r
1\r
◦ (Id × F\r
2\r
) ◦ · · · ◦ (Idp−2 × F\r
p−1\r
) ◦ (Idp−1 × F\r
p\r
(a\r
k\r
))\r
R\r
p F\r
p\r
(a\r
k\r
)\r
−→ R\r
p−1 × A F\r
p−1\r
−→ R\r
p−2 × A −→ . . . −→ R × A F\r
1\r
−→ A\r
11

Thus the map φ = a ◦ h, obtained by composition with the character χ which is\r
linear and continuous and hence smooth, is a smooth map from R\r
p\r
to R\r
p\r
. The\r
image of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
is a(χ). The partial derivatives at 0 are\r
(∂jφ\r
k\r
)(0) = χ(δj (a\r
k\r
))\r
thus we know from the hypothesis of the lemma, that the Jacobian does not vanish\r
at 0. It then follows from the implicit function theorem that the mapping φ = a ◦ h\r
maps by a diffeomorphism a suitable neighborhood of 0 to a neighborhood of a(χ).\r
In particular the image under a of a neighborhood W of χ contains the image under\r
φ of h\r
−1\r
(W) which, since h is continuous, is a neighborhood of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
. This shows\r
that the image under a of any neighborhood of χ in the spectrum Spec(A) of A\r
contains a neighborhood of a(χ) in R\r
p\r
. \u0003\r
The above proof yields the following more precise statement:\r
Lemma 3.4. Under the hypothesis of Lemma 3.3, there exists a smooth family\r
σt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, a neighborhood Z of χ in X = Spec(A) and a neighborhood\r
W of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
such that, for any κ ∈ Z, the map t 7→ a(κ ◦ σt) is a diffeomorphism,\r
depending continuously on κ, of W with a neighborhood of a(κ) in R\r
p\r
.\r
Proof. Let as above\r
(27) σ(t1,...,tp) = F\r
1\r
t1\r
◦ . . . ◦ F\r
p\r
tp\r
The map which to κ ∈ X associates the map ψκ from R\r
p\r
to R\r
p given by ψκ(t) =\r
a(κ ◦ σt) yields by restriction a continuous map X → C∞(K, R\r
p\r
) where K is a\r
closed ball centered at 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
. Indeed for each j the map t ∈ K 7→ σt(a\r
j\r
) ∈ A is\r
smooth by (26) and thus its partial derivatives ∂\r
α\r
t σt(a\r
j\r
) are elements of A which\r
depend continuously of t. One has\r
∂\r
α\r
t ψ\r
j\r
κ\r
(t) = κ(∂\r
α\r
t σt(a\r
j\r
))\r
and thus the partial derivatives of ψκ(t) are continuous functions of (κ, t). Since\r
the determinant of the jacobian χ(δj (a\r
k\r
)) does not vanish, the result follows from\r
the implicit function Theorem (see e.g. [16] Theorem 5.2.3). \u0003\r
4. Jacobian and openness of local charts\r
We first briefly recall first the well known properties of multiple commutators which\r
we need later.\r
Definition 4.1. Let Tj ∈ B be elements of a noncommutative algebra B, one lets\r
[T1, T2, . . . , Tn] = X\r
σ\r
ǫ(σ) Tσ(1)Tσ(2) · · · Tσ(n)\r
where σ varies through all permutations of {1, . . ., n} and ǫ(σ) is its signature.\r
We mention the following general properties\r
Proposition 4.2. Let Tj ∈ B be elements of a noncommutative algebra B.\r
a) For any permutation α of {1, . . ., n}, one has\r
[Tα(1), Tα(2), . . . , Tα(n)] = ǫ(α) [T1, T2, . . . , Tn]\r
12

b) If two of the Tj are equal one has\r
[T1, T2, . . . , Tn] = 0\r
c) Let A ⊂ B be a commutative subalgebra and A′ ⊂ B its relative commutant\r
in B. Let a\r
j\r
k ∈ A, γj ∈ A′\r
. Then, with Tk =\r
Pa\r
j\r
k\r
γj , one has\r
(28) [T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = Det((a\r
j\r
k\r
)) [γ1, γ2, . . . , γn]\r
d) The equality (28) extends to the case of a rectangular matrix a\r
j\r
k ∈ A as\r
follows\r
(29) [T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = X\r
F\r
Det((a\r
j\r
k\r
(F))) [γ1(F), γ2(F), . . . , γn(F)]\r
where the sum is over all subsets F ⊂ {1, . . ., m} with #F = n, the matrix\r
a\r
j\r
k\r
(F) is the restriction of a\r
j\r
k\r
to j ∈ F and the γj (F) are the γi, i ∈ F,\r
ordered with increasing index in F.\r
Proof. a) This follows from ǫ(σ ◦ α) = ǫ(σ)ǫ(α).\r
b) The permutation of the two indices is odd, but does not affect the expression\r
which must vanish.\r
c) One has\r
(30) [T1, T2, . . . , Tn] = X\r
(jk)\r
Yn\r
k=1\r
a\r
jk\r
k\r
[γj1, γj2, . . . , γjn]\r
where, a priori, the (jk) is an arbitrary map from {1, . . ., n} to {1, . . ., n}. By the\r
second statement of the lemma, these terms vanish when two of the indices jk are\r
equal. Thus one can take the sum over permutations (jk) and one can use the first\r
statement of the lemma to rewrite the corresponding term as\r
[γj1, γj2, . . ., γjn] = ǫ(j) [γ1, γ2, . . ., γn]\r
It follows that\r
[T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = Det((a\r
j\r
k\r
)) [γ1, γ2, . . . , γn]\r
d) One decomposes the sum (30) according to the range F of the injection j from\r
{1, . . ., n} to {1, . . ., m}. \u0003\r
Let us now go back to spectral triples (A, H, D) fulfilling the five conditions of §2.\r
Lemma 4.3. Let B be the algebra of endomorphisms of H∞. One has a finite\r
decomposition\r
(31) [D, a] = Xδj (a)γj , ∀a ∈ A ,\r
where γj ∈ B and the δj are derivations of the form\r
(32) δj (a) = i(ξj |[D, a]ξj ), ∀a ∈ A\r
for some ξj ∈ H∞.\r
Proof. First [D, a]H∞ ⊂ H∞ using regularity and (10). Thus the order one condi\u0002tion shows that [D, a] ∈ B. One has H∞ = eAn, B = eMn(A)e for a self-adjoint\r
idempotent e ∈ Mn(A). Thus every element T ∈ B can be written uniquely, as any\r
element of Mn(A) in the form\r
T =\r
Xakℓεkℓ , akℓ ∈ A\r
13

in terms of the matrix units εij . The coefficients akℓ ∈ A are uniquely determined,\r
using the elements ηk = eζk ∈ H∞ where ζk ∈ An is the element all of whose\r
components vanish except the k-th one which is equal to 1. Using the A-valued\r
inner product, one has\r
(33) akℓ = (ηk|Tηℓ) = Lkℓ(T ), ∀k, ℓ .\r
Moreover one has, since T = eTe and the akℓ commute with e:\r
(34) T =\r
Xakℓeεkℓe .\r
One has Lkℓ(aT ) = aLkℓ(T ) for any a ∈ A. Applying this to T = [D, b], the\r
maps a 7→ Lij ([D, a]) give derivations of A. They are not self-adjoint but can be\r
decomposed as linear combinations of self-adjoint derivations, which, using (34),\r
gives the required formula (31). More precisely, the derivations δj can be written\r
using the A-valued inner product on H∞ in the form (32) for some ξj ∈ H∞\r
(with i to ensure self-adjointness). Indeed one obtains (32) applying to (33) the\r
polarization identity:\r
(35) 2(ξ|Tη) = ((ξ + η)|T (ξ + η)) − (ξ|Tξ) − (η|Tη)\r
−i(((ξ + iη)|T (ξ + iη)) − (ξ|Tξ) − (iη|Tiη))\r
In particular, using Proposition 2.3, the δj are continuous. \u0003\r
By hypothesis the cycle c is of the form:\r
(36) c =\r
X\r
α\r
a\r
0\r
α ωα , ωα =\r
X\r
β\r
ǫ(β)1 ⊗ a\r
β(1)\r
α ⊗ · · · ⊗ a\r
β(p)\r
α\r
where one can assume that the a\r
µ\r
α are self-adjoint for µ > 0. We define the condi\u0002tional expectation EA : EndA(H∞) → A, using the projections pj of (7),\r
(37) EA(T ) = X\r
j>0\r
1\r
j\r
pj\r
XTkk , ∀T = (Tkℓ) ∈ eMn(A)e\r
using the identification H∞ = eAn. We obtain a self-adjoint ρα ∈ A given6 by\r
(38) ρα = i\r
p(p+1)\r
2 EA(γ\r
X\r
β\r
ǫ(β)[D, aβ(1)\r
α ] · · · [D, aβ(p)α ]).\r
One lets\r
(39) Cα = {x ∈ X | ρα(x) = 0}\r
and Uα = C\r
c\r
α be its complement i.e. the open set where ρα does not vanish.\r
Lemma 4.4. The Uα form an open cover of X = Spec(A).\r
Each Uα is the disjoint union of the two open subsets U\r
±\r
α corresponding to the sign\r
of ρα,\r
±ρα(x) > 0 , ∀x ∈ U\r
±\r
α .\r
Proof. It is enough to show that any x ∈ X belongs to some Uα. One has πD(c) = γ,\r
so that by (36)\r
γ\r
X\r
α\r
a\r
0\r
α\r
X\r
β\r
ǫ(β)[D, aβ(1)\r
α ] · · · [D, aβ(p)\r
α ] = 1 .\r
6\r
there is no γ in the odd case\r
14

By (38) and the conditional expectation module property EA(aT ) = aEA(T ),\r
i\r
−\r
p(p+1)\r
2\r
X\r
α\r
a\r
0\r
α ρα = 1\r
and ρα(x) 6= 0 for some α. The second statement follows since ρα is a non-vanishing\r
real valued function on Uα. \u0003\r
We let sα be the natural continuous map from X to R\r
p given by\r
(40) χ ∈ Spec(A) → (χ(a\r
j\r
α)) ∈ R\r
p\r
.\r
Lemma 4.5. Assume that derivations of the form (32) exponentiate. Let χ ∈ Uα.\r
• There exists p derivations δj ∈ Der(A) such that χ(Det((δj (a\r
k\r
α)))) 6= 0\r
• The map aα from Uα to R\r
p\r
is open.\r
• There exists a smooth family σt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, a neighborhood Z of χ\r
in X = Spec(A) and a neighborhood W of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
such that, for any κ ∈ Z,\r
the map t 7→ sα(κ ◦ σt) is a diffeomorphism, depending continuously on κ,\r
of W with a neighborhood of a(κ) in R\r
p\r
.\r
Proof. We let, as above, B be the algebra of endomorphisms of the A-module H∞.\r
It contains A ⊂ B as a subalgebra of its center. By Lemma 4.3, one has derivations\r
δj ∈ Der(A) of the form (32), such that the formula (31) holds:\r
[D, a] = Xm\r
1\r
δj (a)γj , ∀a ∈ A .\r
By hypothesis we have ρα(χ) 6= 0. Thus, the following endomorphism of the A\u0002module H∞ does not vanish,\r
[[D, a1\r
α], [D, a2α], . . . , [D, apα]](χ) 6= 0 , ∀χ ∈ Uα .\r
It thus follows, from (29) of proposition 4.2, that for χ ∈ Uα one can find p elements\r
δj ∈ Der(A) among the above δj such that:\r
(41) χ(Det((δj (a\r
k\r
α)))) 6= 0 .\r
Now let V ⊂ Uα be open. To show that sα(V ) is open one needs to show that, for\r
any χ ∈ V , sα(V ) contains a neighborhood of sα(χ). But V is a neighborhood of χ\r
in Spec(A) and the hypothesis of Lemma 3.3 is fulfilled so that this lemma shows\r
that sα(V ) contains a neighborhood of sα(χ). The third statement follows from\r
Lemma 3.4. \u0003\r
5. Dissipative derivations\r
We assumed in the above discussion that the algebra A is expable. It is of course\r
desirable to remove this hypothesis, and this will be done in this section and the next\r
one. We need a form of existence and uniqueness for solutions of linear differential\r
equations with values in a Frechet space E. Simple examples show that in that\r
generality one has neither existence nor uniqueness. For failure of existence just let\r
A = C∞([0, 1]), δ0 = ∂x. For failure of uniqueness, let E be the space of sequences\r
xn ∈ R for n ≥ 1 and take the shift operator S, then the equation\r
∂tx = Sx, (Sx)n = xn+1 ,\r
15

X\r
XΑ\r
sΑ\r
x\r
Figure 1. The map sα from X to Xα\r
has no uniqueness of solutions. Indeed we can take for x1(t) any smooth function\r
which is flat at t = 0, i.e. ∂\r
n\r
t x1(0) = 0, and then define by induction xn+1(t) =\r
∂txn(t) so that ∂tx = Sx holds and the initial condition x(0) = 0 does not imply\r
uniqueness.\r
In our case we need to know that any derivation δ ∈ DerA can be exponentiated,\r
i.e. that one has existence and uniqueness for the differential equation\r
dy(t)\r
dt = δ(y(t)), y(t) ∈ A .\r
It is only the compactness of X that ensures this, and also the fact that one is\r
dealing with a real vector field. This means that we first need to make sure that\r
the derivation exponentiates at the level of the C\r
∗\r
-algebra as discussed in [2].\r
One step towards this would be to show directly the following corollary of expability:\r
Lemma 5.1. Assume that the derivations of the form the form (32) exponentiate,\r
then, for any h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, the commutator [D, h] vanishes where7 h reaches its\r
maximum. Conversely if this property holds the derivations ±δj of the form (32)\r
are dissipative (cf. [2], Definition 1.4.6), i.e.\r
(42) kx + λδj (x)k ≥ kxk , ∀x ∈ A , λ ∈ R .\r
Proof. One has, by (31), [D, h] = Pδj (h)γj where δj ∈ DerA. Thus it is enough\r
to show that δj (h)(χ) = 0 where h = h\r
∗ ∈ A reaches its maximum at χ. This\r
follows from the existence of e\r
tδj ∈ Aut(A) using the differentiable function f(t) =\r
χ(e\r
tδj (h)) which has a maximum at t = 0 and hence vanishing derivative.\r
Conversely, the derivations δj are of the form (32) i.e. δj (h) = i(ξ|[D, h]ξ). Thus\r
the vanishing of [D, h](χ) where h = h\r
∗ ∈ A reaches its maximum, ensures that\r
δj(h)(χ) = ihξ(χ), [D, h](χ)ξ(χ)i = 0 also vanishes. Thus one has\r
kh + λδj (h)k ≥ khk , ∀h = h\r
∗ ∈ A , λ ∈ R ,\r
7This makes sense since [D, h] commutes with h\r
16

since for a character χ of A with χ(±h) = khk one has χ(±(h + λδj (h))) = khk. In\r
the complex case i.e. for an arbitrary x ∈ A, let ψ be a state on A ⊃ A, such that\r
|ψ(x)| = kxk. Replacing x 7→ ux for u ∈ C, |u| = 1, one can assume that ψ(x) > 0.\r
Then writing x = h + ik with h = h\r
∗ and k = k∗\r
, one has ψ(x) = ψ(h) = khk so\r
that ψ(δj (h)) = 0 from the above discussion. Then one has, for λ ∈ R,\r
ψ(x + λδj (x)) = ψ(h) + iλψ(δj (k))\r
and |ψ(x + λδj (x))| ≥ ψ(h) = kxk. \u0003\r
Note that the commutativity of [D, h] with h and the self-adjointness of D do not\r
suffice to entail the conclusion of Lemma 5.1. This can be seen with the following\r
spectral triple:\r
(43) A = C\r
∞([0, 1]), H = L2\r
([0, 1]) ⊗ C\r
2\r
, D =\r
\u0012\r
0 ∂x\r
−∂x 0\r
\u0013\r
with the boundary condition\r
(44) DomD = {ξ =\r
\u0012\r
ξ1\r
ξ2\r
\u0013\r
| ξ1(0) = 0 , ξ2(1) = 0} .\r
For any h ∈ A one has [D, h] = ∂xhγ1,\r
γ1 =\r
\u0012\r
0 1\r
−1 0 \u0013\r
so that [D, h] commutes with h. For h(x) = x the maximum is at x = 1 and [D, h]\r
does not vanish there. This example shows that the hypothesis of expability of the\r
algebra A appears at first sight as essential. However, in this example, condition 5\r
fails since the boundary condition (44) does not yield a finite projective submodule\r
of C∞([0, 1]) ⊗ C\r
2 over A = C∞([0, 1]). Also [D, h] = ∂xhγ1 does not preserve\r
the domain of D which is the same as the domain of |D| thus regularity fails.\r
Orientability also fails in this example. We shall now show that regularity allows\r
in fact to obtain the required dissipativity.\r
Let us consider the one parameter group of automorphisms of L(H) given by\r
(45) αt(T ) = e\r
itDTe−itD , ∀t ∈ R\r
Lemma 5.2. Let T preserve DomD and [D, T ] be bounded. Then the function\r
t 7→ αt(T ) is norm continuous,\r
(46) kαs(T ) − αt(T )k ≤ |s − t| k[D, T ]k\r
and when s → 0 the difference quotient\r
(47) αs(T ) − T\r
s\r
=\r
i\r
s\r
Z s\r
0\r
αt([D, T ])dt\r
converges to i[D, T ] in the strong topology.\r
Proof. Let ξ ∈ DomD. Then 1\r
s\r
(e\r
isD − 1)ξ → iDξ (in norm) when s → 0. Thus\r
using\r
1\r
s\r
(e\r
isDTe−isD − T )ξ =\r
1\r
s\r
e\r
isDT (e−isD − 1)ξ +\r
1\r
s\r
(e\r
isD − 1)Tξ\r
one gets that (in norm) when s → 0\r
1\r
s\r
(e\r
isDTe−isD − T )ξ → i[D, T ]ξ\r
17

Thus t 7→ αt(T )ξ is of class C\r
1\r
. Its derivative is t 7→ iαt([D, T ])ξ. Thus\r
(48) (αs(T ) − αt(T ))ξ = i\r
Z s\r
t\r
αu([D, T ])ξdu\r
holds for all ξ ∈ DomD and hence all ξ ∈ H since the map u 7→ αu([D, T ])ξ is\r
continuous, as follows from the continuity of s 7→ e\r
isDη for any η ∈ H. Both\r
statements follow. \u0003\r
We can now consider the C\r
∗\r
-algebra C generated by the αs(h) for h = h\r
∗ ∈ A\r
as above. It is norm separable and the αs ∈ Aut(C) form a norm continuous one\r
parameter group. To try and prove that [D, h] vanishes where h = h\r
∗ ≥ 0 reaches\r
its maximum, one considers a state φ on C such that φ(h) = khk. It is obtained by\r
extension using the inclusion C\r
∗\r
(h) ⊂ C. The function\r
f(s) = φ(αs(h))\r
is a Lipschitz function and reaches its maximum: khk at s = 0. Thus if one could\r
assert that the derivative at s = 0 is given by φ([D, h]), one would get the vanishing\r
φ([D, h]) = 0. The problem is that αu([D, h]) is not in general a norm continuous\r
function of u and thus the differentiability only holds in the strong topology but\r
not in the norm topology.\r
Things are easier with |D| since the regularity conditions ensures that the map\r
(49) t → γt(a) = e\r
it|D|\r
ae−it|D|\r
is in fact of class C∞ in the norm topology (cf. Lemma 13.3 of §13). Moreover the\r
following Lemma shows that it is enough to show the vanishing of [[D2, a], b] at χ\r
for all b ∈ A to get the vanishing of [D, a] at χ.\r
Lemma 5.3. Let h = h\r
∗ ∈ A and χ ∈ Spec(A). If [[D2\r
, h], h] vanishes at χ then\r
[D, h] vanishes at χ.\r
Proof.\r
(50) [[D\r
2\r
, h], h] = 2[D, h]\r
2\r
using the order one condition. \u0003\r
Note that (50) shows that [D, h]\r
2 and hence |[D, h]| only depends upon D2 and\r
hence |D| and not upon the phase of the polar decomposition of D. This comes\r
from the order one condition. Moreover one has the following vanishing of [|D|, h]\r
where h = h\r
∗ ∈ A reaches its maximum.\r
Lemma 5.4. For any h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, h ≥ 0, reaching its maximum at χ ∈ Spec(A)\r
and any sequence bn ∈ A, kbnk ≤ 1, with support tending to {χ}, one has\r
(51) kb\r
∗\r
n[|D|, h]bnk → 0\r
Proof. Let ξn ∈ H be unit vectors with support tending to {χ}. Then consider any\r
limit state on L(H):\r
(52) η(T ) = limωhξn, Tξni\r
One has η(h) = h(χ) since h is a continuous function on X = Spec(A). Thus\r
η(h) = khk. When applied to |D| instead of D, Lemma 46 shows that both γs(h)\r
and γs(δ(h)) are Lipschitz functions of s, while\r
(53) γs(h) − h\r
s\r
=\r
1\r
s\r
Z s\r
0\r
γt(iδ(h))dt → iδ(h)\r
18

so that γs(h) is of class C\r
1\r
in norm. It follows that the function s 7→ η(γs(h))\r
is of class C\r
1\r
. It is maximal for s = 0 and hence its derivative vanishes so that\r
η(δ(h)) = 0. Thus\r
(54) limωhξn, δ(h)ξni = 0\r
and this continues to hold for any bounded sequence ξn ∈ H with support tending\r
to {χ}. Now, let bn be as in the Lemma, then if (51) does not hold, one can find\r
a subsequence nk with kb\r
∗\r
nk\r
[|D|, h]bnkk ≥ ǫ > 0 for all k. Using polarization (35),\r
one gets unit vectors ξ\r
′\r
k ∈ H such that\r
|hξ\r
′\r
k\r
, b∗\r
nk\r
[|D|, h]bnkξ\r
′\r
k\r
i| ≥ ǫ\r
′ > 0\r
which contradicts (54), for ξk = bnkξ\r
′\r
k\r
. \u0003\r
We shall use the analogue in our context of the notion of symbol for pseudodiffer\u0002ential operators. The symbol of T can be viewed as a weak limit of the conjugate\r
operators of the form\r
τ\r
−k\r
e\r
iτφTe−iτφ , τ → ∞\r
where the integer k is the order of T . For instance the symbol of D is given by\r
−i[D, φ] since the order one condition gives\r
(55) τ\r
−1\r
e\r
iτφDe−iτφ = −i[D, φ] + τ−1 D\r
One expects the symbol of D2to be of the form\r
(56) limτ→∞\r
1\r
τ\r
2\r
e\r
iτφD2\r
e\r
−iτφξ = −[D, φ]2\r
ξ , ∀ξ ∈ DomD2\r
This is obtained by squaring (55) but one needs to know that DomD is invariant\r
under [D, φ] to control the term D [D, φ]. This is insured by regularity.\r
Remark 5.5. In the example (43) considered above, [D, φ] does not map DomD2\r
to DomD so that D [D, φ]ξ does not make sense in that case. In fact regularity\r
fails, and DomD2is not invariant under φ, unless [D, φ] vanishes on the boundary.\r
To see this note that the boundary condition for D2is\r
(57) ξ =\r
\u0012\r
ξ1\r
ξ2\r
\u0013\r
∈ DomD\r
2 ⇔ ξ1(0) = 0 , ∂xξ2(0) = 0 , ξ2(1) = 0 , ∂xξ1(1) = 0 .\r
which contains the Neumann condition ∂xξ2(0) = 0 while ξ2(0) is arbitrary. Thus\r
∂xφξ2(0) = ∂xφ(0)ξ2(0) vanishes only when ∂xφ(0) = 0.\r
In the case of an operator of order 0 there is no power of τ and one deals with a\r
bounded family so that one can expect the limit to be a weak limit. We need to\r
guess the symbol of [|D|, h]. We expect that if we choose φ = h, this symbol will just\r
be i|[D, h]| ∈ End S. The symbol of [D2, h] is (using [D2, h] = D[D, h] + [D, h]D)\r
(58) τ\r
−1\r
e\r
iτφ[D2\r
, h]e\r
−iτφ = −i([D, φ][D, h] + [D, h][D, φ]) + τ−1\r
[D\r
2\r
, h]\r
To see why we should expect the symbol of [|D|, h] for φ = h to just be i|[D, h]| we\r
have:\r
Lemma 5.6. Assume that when τ → ∞ the following limit holds in the strong\r
topology:\r
limτ→∞e\r
iτh[|D|, h]e−iτh = T .\r
19

Then one has, with strong convergence on DomD:\r
limτ→∞τ\r
−1\r
e\r
iτh|D|e−iτh = −iT .\r
Proof. One defines a one parameter group βu of automorphisms:\r
(59) βu(Y ) = e\r
iuhY e−iuh\r
One has, at the formal level, d\r
duβu(Y ) = −iβu([Y, h]). Taking Y = |D| one gets,\r
with the notations of the Lemma, and using regularity\r
(60) e\r
iuh[|D|, h]e−iuhξ = i\r
d\r
duβu(|D|)ξ , ∀ξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
which gives\r
(61) Z τ\r
0\r
e\r
iuh[|D|, h]e−iuhξdu = i(βτ (|D|) − |D|)ξ , ∀ξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
Note that this equality continues to hold for any ξ ∈ H since βτ (|D|) − |D| is\r
a bounded operator. Now e\r
iuh[|D|, h]e−iuh is uniformly bounded and converges\r
strongly by hypothesis to T . Thus one has, for the Cesaro mean:\r
limτ→∞τ\r
−1\r
Z τ\r
0\r
e\r
iuh[|D|, h]e−iuhξ du = Tξ , ∀ξ ∈ H\r
which gives the result since one controls τ\r
−1\r
|D|ξ → 0 for ξ ∈ DomD. \u0003\r
Moreover we expect the symbol map to be a morphism so that the symbol of |D|\r
is given by the absolute value of the symbol of D i.e. by |[D, h]|. In fact we do not\r
need to prove the converse of Lemma 5.6 since we can use the regularization by\r
Cesaro mean to compose the states η, with weak limits of Cτ (T ),\r
(62) Cτ (T ) = τ\r
−1\r
Z τ\r
0\r
βu(T )du\r
Lemma 5.7. With h as above one has\r
(1) Cτ is a completely positive map from L(H) to itself and Cτ (1) = 1\r
(2) Cτ (aTb) = aCτ (T )b for all a, b ∈ A.\r
(3) Cτ ([|D|, h]) = i\r
τ\r
(e\r
iτh|D|e−iτh − |D|)\r
Proof. The first two statements follow from (62) using the commutativity of A to\r
get βu(aTb) = aβu(T )b. The last statement follows from (61). \u0003\r
We can then compose the vector states hξn, • ξni used in the construction of η (52)\r
with Cτn\r
to replace [|D|, h] by i|[D, h]|.\r
Thus we need to determine the principal symbol of |D|. The intuitive idea is as\r
follows: one has\r
(63) βτ (D) = e\r
iτhDe−iτh = D − iτ[D, h]\r
since h commutes with [D, h] so that [D, f(h)] = f\r
′\r
(h)[D, h] for f smooth (cf. [17]).\r
Thus, by homogeneity of the absolute value,\r
(64) 1\r

βτ (|D|) = 1\r
τ\r
e\r
iτh|D|e−iτh = |\r
D\r
τ\r
− i[D, h]| , ∀τ > 0\r
We need the weak limit in H for τ → ∞ of 1\r
τ\r
βτ (|D|)ξ for ξ ∈ DomD. These vectors\r
are bounded in norm as follows from\r
(65) k\r
1\r
τ\r
βτ (|D|)ξk = k|ǫD − i[D, h]|ξk = k(ǫD − i[D, h])ξk , ǫ = 1/τ\r
20

which is bounded since ξ ∈ DomD so that kǫDξk → 0. Note also that 1\r
τ\r
βτ (|D|) is\r
a positive operator so that any weak limit η of 1\r
τ\r
βτ (|D|)ξ fulfills hξ, ηi ≥ 0.\r
Let us now show how to use regularity to obtain the strong convergence of\r
(66) 1\r
τ\r
βτ (|D|)ξ = |ǫD − i[D, h]|ξ\r
when ǫ → 0 and ξ ∈ DomD. By (65) we can assume that ξ ∈ H∞. We let\r
X(ǫ) = ǫD − i[D, h]. By (63) it is a self-adjoint operator with H∞ as a core since\r
H∞ is invariant under e\r
iτh. The same holds for |X(ǫ)|.\r
Lemma 5.8. One has, with X(ǫ) = ǫD − i[D, h],\r
(67) |X(ǫ)| = Y (ǫ) + f0(X(ǫ))\r
where\r
(68) Y (ǫ)ξ =\r

Proof. For any self-adjoint operator T one has k(1 + u\r

2\r
)\r
−1/2\r
since the\r
function x(1 + x\r
2\r
)\r
−1/2 does not vanish at ∞. Thus we get strong convergence\r
on DomT . This applies to X(ǫ) which is, up to a scale factor, conjugate to D\r
by an automorphism of DomD so that (68) holds with Y (ǫ) = f(X(ǫ)), f(x) =\r

2\r

. Finally one has f0 ∈ C0(R) and f(x) + f0(x) = |x|. \u0003\r
For each λ ≥ 0 we define a transformation on operators acting in H∞ by\r
(70) θλ(T ) = (D2 + λ)T (D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
Lemma 5.9. Let h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, there exists λ < ∞ such that\r
(71) kθλ((1 + u\r

)\r
−1\r
)k ≤ (\r
1\r
2\r

2\r
)\r
−1\r
, ∀u .\r
Proof. Let ξ ∈ H∞ and let us give a lower bound for kθλ(1 + u\r
2 + X(0)2\r
)ξk. Using\r
(72) θλ(T ) = T + [D2, T ](D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
we get\r
(73) θλ(X(0)2\r
) = X(0)2 − [D2, [D, h]\r
2\r
](D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
Now the regularity shows (cf. §13) that [D2, [D, h]\r
2\r
](D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
is compact so that\r
for λ → ∞ its norm goes to 0 (in fact it is of the form Bλ(D2 + λ)\r
−1/2 with the\r
21

norm of Bλ bounded, so its norm decays like λ\r
−1/2\r
). Thus we can choose λ large\r
enough so that Z = θλ(X(0)2) − X(0)2fulfills kZk ≤ 1/2. We then get\r
hξ, θλ(1 + u\r
2 + X(0)2\r
)ξi ≥ hξ, 1 + u\r

ξi − |hξ, Zξi| ≥ (\r

)ξk ≥ (\r
1\r
2\r

2\r
)kξk , ∀ξ ∈ H∞ .\r
It remains to show that θλ(1+u\r
2+X(0)2\r
) is invertible as an operator acting in H∞.\r
Since D2 + λ is an automorphism of H∞, it is enough to show that 1 + u\r
2 + X(0)2\r
is invertible as an operator acting in H∞. One has X(0)2 = −[D, h]\r
2 ≥ 0 so that\r
1+u\r
2+X(0)2\r
is invertible as an operator in H. Its invertibility in H∞ follows from\r
the stability under smooth functional calculus (Proposition 2.4) of the algebra\r
{T ∈ L(H)| T H∞ ⊂ H∞ , kδ\r
m(T )k < ∞ , ∀m}\r
and the fact that, by regularity, [D, h] belongs to this algebra. \u0003\r
Lemma 5.10. Let h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, then when ǫ → 0,\r
(75) Y (ǫ)ξ → Y (0)ξ , ∀ξ ∈ H∞\r
Proof. One has for the action on H∞,\r

Now one has, using regularity,\r
k(ǫ\r
2D2 − iǫ[D2\r

k = k(ǫ) = O(ǫ)\r
while, since X(ǫ) is self-adjoint,\r
k\r

k ≤ 1 .\r
Moreover (D2 + λ)ξ ∈ H∞ ⊂ H. By Lemma 5.9, for λ large enough, one thus gets\r

Thus after integrating in u we get the following estimate\r

It remains to estimate the continuity for ǫ → 0 of f0(X(ǫ))ξ. The above proof shows\r
that for ga(x) = (a+x\r

−1 and any a > 0 one has the norm continuity of ga(X(ǫ))ξ\r
when ǫ → 0 (we showed convergence only for ξ ∈ H∞ but it holds in general using\r
the boundedness of the functions ga). The even functions in f ∈ C0(R) for which\r
the following holds\r
(76) kf(X(ǫ))ξ − f(X(0))ξk → 0 , ∀ξ ∈ H\r
form a norm closed subalgebra of C0(R)\r
even. This algebra contains the functions\r
ga, thus the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem shows that (76) holds for all f ∈ C0(R)\r
even\r
and in particular for f0. We thus get:\r
Proposition 5.11. Let h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, then one has, with norm convergence:\r
(77) limτ→∞τ\r
−1\r
e\r
iτh|D|e−iτhξ = |[D, h]|ξ , ∀ξ ∈ DomD .\r
Proof. By (66) we just need to show that |X(ǫ)|ξ → |X(0)|ξ when ǫ → 0 for any\r
ξ ∈ H∞. By (67) |X(ǫ)| = Y (ǫ)+f0(X(ǫ)). By Lemma 5.9 we have Y (ǫ)ξ → Y (0)ξ\r
for ξ ∈ H∞, and by the above discussion f0(X(ǫ))ξ is continuous at ǫ = 0. Thus\r
we get the required result for ξ ∈ H∞. The general case ξ ∈ DomD follows using\r
(65). \u0003\r
Remark 5.12. Proposition 5.11 shows that, under the regularity hypothesis,\r
(78) [|[D, h]|, [D, a]] = 0 , ∀h = h\r
∗\r
, a ∈ A .\r
Indeed one has\r
[e\r
iτh|D|e−iτh\r
, [D, a]] = e\r
iτh[|D|, [D, a]]e−iτh\r
and the norm of [|D|, [D, a]] is finite so that τ\r
−1k[eiτh|D|e−iτh\r
, [D, a]]k → 0 for\r
τ → ∞. Thus one has\r
limτ→∞τ\r
−1\r
(e\r
iτh|D|e−iτh[D, a]ξ − [D, a]eiτh|D|e−iτhξ) = 0 , ∀ξ ∈ DomD ,\r
and, since [D, a] preserves DomD,\r
[|[D, h]|, [D, a]]ξ = 0 , ∀ξ ∈ DomD .\r
Note also that, by the same argument, under the strong regularity hypothesis of\r
Definition 6.1 below, this shows that\r
(79) [D, h]\r
2 ∈ A , ∀h = h∗ ∈ A .\r
Indeed |[D, h]| then commutes with all endomorphisms of H∞. Its square [D, h]\r
2\r
,\r
being itself an endomorphism, belongs to the center of EndA(H∞) and is, by (9),\r
an element of A.\r
We can now show that regularity suffices to ensure the dissipative property of\r
Lemma 5.1.\r
23

Theorem 5.13. Let (A, H, D) be a regular spectral triple with A commutative\r
fulfilling the order one condition. Then for any h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, the commutator [D, h]\r
vanishes where h reaches its maximum, i.e. for any sequence bn ∈ A, kbnk ≤ 1,\r
with support tending to {χ}, where χ is a character such that |χ(h)| is maximum,\r
one has\r
k[D, h]bnk → 0 .\r
Proof. By Proposition 5.11 combined with the third statement of Lemma 5.7 one\r
has, first for ξ ∈ DomD and then by uniformity for all ξ ∈ H,\r
limτ→∞Cτ ([|D|, h])ξ = limτ→∞\r
i\r
τ\r
(e\r
iτh|D|e−iτhξ − |D|ξ) = i|[D, h]|ξ\r
and thus the Cτ ([|D|, h]) converge strongly to i|[D, h]| when τ → ∞. By the second\r
statement of Lemma 5.7, one has\r
(80) Cτ (b\r
∗\r
n\r
[|D|, h]bn) = b\r
∗\r
nCτ ([|D|, h])bn\r
Thus fixing n and taking the limit for τ → ∞ one gets\r
(81) Cτ (b\r
∗\r
n\r
[|D|, h]bn) → ib∗\r
n\r
|[D, h]|bn\r
One thus gets\r
(82) kb\r
∗\r
n|[D, h]|bnk ≤ kb\r
∗\r
n[|D|, h]bnk\r
But Lemma 5.4 shows that kb\r
∗\r
n[|D|, h]bnk → 0 when n → ∞ which gives the re\u0002quired result. Moreover, since |[D, h]| commutes with the bn this can be formulated\r
as k[D, h]bnk → 0 . \u0003\r
Corollary 5.14. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple with A commutative fulfilling\r
the five conditions of §2. The derivations ±δj of Lemma 4.3 are dissipative.\r
Proof. This follows from Theorem 5.13 and Lemma 5.1. \u0003\r
Corollary 5.15. Let h = h\r
∗ ∈ A. The principal symbol of the operator\r
(83) Grad(h) = [D2, h]\r
vanishes where h reaches its maximum.\r
Proof. One has [D2, h] = D[D, h] + [D, h]D and since [D, h] commutes with A one\r
gets the principal symbol of [D2, h] from that of D which gives\r
(84) limτ→∞\r
1\r
τ\r
e\r
iτφ[D2\r
, h]e\r
iτφ = −i([D, φ][D, h] + [D, h][D, φ])\r
Thus the result follows from Theorem 5.13. \u0003\r
6. Self-adjointness and derivations\r
We now introduce a technical hypothesis which will play an important role.\r
Definition 6.1. A spectral triple is strongly regular when all endomorphisms of\r
the A-module H∞ are regular.\r
Our goal is to obtain self-adjoint operators from the operator D, in the form A∗DA\r
where A is regular i.e. belongs to the domains of δ\r
m for all m.\r
24

Lemma 6.2. Let A be regular, then ADomD ⊂ DomD and the adjoint of A∗D is\r
the closure of the densely defined operator T\r
(85) DomT = DomD , Tξ = D(Aξ), ∀ξ ∈ DomD\r
Proof. By regularity both A and A∗ preserve the domain Dom|D| = DomD so that\r
(85) makes sense. The domain of A∗D is the domain of D. An η ∈ H belongs to\r
the domain of the adjoint S = (A∗D)\r
∗ when there exists a constant C < ∞ such\r
that\r
(86) |hA\r
∗Dξ, ηi| ≤ Ckξk , ∀ξ ∈ DomD\r
One has hA∗Dξ, ηi = hDξ, Aηi and, since D is self-adjoint, the above condition\r
means that Aη ∈ DomD. Moreover one then has Sη = DAη. In other words\r
S = DA with domain\r
(87) DomS = {η | Aη ∈ DomD} , Sξ = D(Aξ), ∀ξ ∈ DomS\r
To prove the Lemma we need to show that S is the closure of the operator T of\r
(85). Let η ∈ DomS. We construct a sequence ηn ∈ DomD such that\r
(88) ηn → η , DAηn → DAη\r
In fact we let\r
(89) η(ǫ) = (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
η , ∀ǫ > 0 .\r
It belongs to DomD by construction and η(ǫ) → η when ǫ → 0. One has\r
DAη(ǫ) = D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1Aη + ǫD(1 + ǫ|D|)−1\r
[|D|, A](1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
η\r
Since Aη ∈ DomD one has D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1Aη = (1 + ǫ|D|)−1DAη → DAη. The\r
remainder is of the form B(ǫ)[|D|, A]η(ǫ) where B(ǫ) = ǫD(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
is of norm\r
less than 1, [|D|, A] is bounded and η(ǫ) → η. Thus it behaves like B(ǫ)[|D|, A]η\r
and hence tends to 0 when ǫ → 0, since B(ǫ)ζ → 0 for any ζ ∈ H. This shows that\r
DAη(ǫ) → DAη and S is the closure of T . \u0003\r
Corollary 6.3. Let ϕ = ϕ\r
∗ ∈ A then the operator H = ϕDϕ with domain DomD\r
is essentially self-adjoint.\r
Proof. One has H = ϕ\r
2D + ϕ[D, ϕ] on DomD. The bounded perturbation P =\r
ϕ[D, ϕ] does not alter the domain of the adjoint H∗ which is thus the same as\r
the domain of H∗\r
0\r
, H0 = ϕ\r
2D. By Lemma 6.2, the adjoint of H0 is the closure of\r
Dϕ2 with domain DomD. This is the same as the closure of ϕDϕ + [D, ϕ]ϕ with\r
domain DomD. Since [D, ϕ]ϕ is bounded we thus get that the adjoint H∗\r
0 of H0\r
is the sum of the closure of ϕDϕ with domain DomD with the bounded operator\r
[D, ϕ]ϕ. Thus when adding P\r
∗ = −[D, ϕ]ϕ to H∗\r
0 we obtain the closure of ϕDϕ\r
with domain DomD, i.e. the operator H. \u0003\r
Lemma 6.4. Let A be regular. Then A∗D is closable and\r
• For any ξ in the domain of the closure A∗D of A∗D, one has, for ǫ > 0,\r
(90) (1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1A∗Dξ = A∗D(1+ǫ|D|)−1\r
ξ−(1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
[|D|, A∗]ǫD(1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ\r
• The domain of A∗D is the set of ξ ∈ H for which the A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ\r
converge in norm for ǫ → 0.\r
• The limit of the A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ gives A∗Dξ.\r
25

Proof. The operator A∗D is closable since its adjoint is densely defined by Lemma\r
6.2. The right hand side of (90) is a bounded operator, thus it is enough to prove\r
the equality for ξ ∈ DomD since A∗D is the closure of its restriction to DomD. For\r
ξ ∈ DomD (90) follows from\r
[(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
, A∗] = −(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
[ǫ|D|, A∗](1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
.\r
Let then ξ be in the domain of the closure A∗D. By (90), A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ is the\r
sum of (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1A∗Dξ → A∗Dξ, and of (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
[|D|, A∗]ǫD(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ\r
which converges to 0 in norm since (1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
[|D|, A∗] is uniformly bounded while\r
ǫD(1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ converges to 0 in norm. Thus A∗D(1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ is convergent when\r
ǫ → 0. Conversely, if the A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ converge in norm for ǫ → 0, then since\r
(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ → ξ and (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ ∈ DomD, one gets that ξ is in the domain\r
of the closure A∗D of A∗D and that moreover the limit of the A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ\r
gives A∗Dξ. \u0003\r
Proposition 6.5. Let A be regular then the operator H = A∗DA with domain\r
DomD is essentially self-adjoint. The domain of the closure of H is the set of\r
ξ ∈ H for which the A∗DA(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ converge in norm for ǫ → 0. The limit of\r
the A∗DA(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
ξ gives Hξ.\r
Proof. Let us first check that H is symmetric. One has for ξ and η in DomD,\r
hHξ, ηi = hA\r
∗DAξ, ηi = hDAξ, Aηi = hAξ, DAηi = hξ, A∗DAηi = hξ, Hηi\r
Let us now show that H∗is the closure of H. Let η ∈ DomH∗. Then there exists\r
C < ∞ with\r
|hA\r
∗DAξ, ηi| ≤ Ckξk , ∀ξ ∈ DomD .\r
Since hA∗DAξ, ηi = hDAξ, Aηi, this means that Aη is in the domain of the adjoint\r
of DA with domain DomD i.e.\r
Aη ∈ DomT\r
∗\r
, H∗η = T\r
∗Aη\r
where T is defined in (85). By Lemma 6.2 the adjoint of A∗D is the closure of T :\r
(A∗D)\r
∗ = T¯. The adjoint T∗ of T is the same as the adjoint of the closure T¯, and\r
is the closure A∗D = (A∗D)\r
∗∗ of A∗D. Thus by Lemma 6.4 we have, since Aη is\r
in the domain of A∗D, the convergence of A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1Aη to A∗DAη = H∗η.\r
Moreover, as above, we have\r
A\r
∗D(1+ǫ|D|)−1Aη−A∗DA(1+ǫ|D|)−1\r
η = −A\r
∗\r
ǫD(1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
[|D|, A](1+ǫ|D|)\r
−1\r
η\r
and the right hand side converges to 0 in norm when ǫ → 0. Thus we have shown\r
that for any η ∈ DomH∗ one gets the convergence of A∗DA(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1η to H∗η.\r
This shows, since (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1η ∈ DomH, that H∗\r
is the closure of H and hence\r
that H is essentially self-adjoint. It also gives a characterization of the domain of\r
the closure of H as required. \u0003\r
We now want to apply this result using endomorphisms of the A-module H∞ which\r
are of rank one, in order to obtain an operator on A itself.\r
Lemma 6.6. Let ξ, η ∈ H∞ then the following gives an endomorphism of the\r
A-module H∞:\r
(91) Tξ,η(ζ) = (η|ζ)ξ , ∀ζ ∈ H∞\r
26

where (η|ζ) is the A-valued inner product. One has\r
(92) Taξ, bη = ab∗Tξ,η , ∀a, b ∈ A , T ∗\r
ξ,η = Tη,ξ\r
Proof. This follows from the A-linearity of the inner product, which is linear in the\r
second variable and antilinear in the first. The equality T\r
∗\r
ξ,η = Tη,ξ follows from\r
hTη,ξα, βi = h(ξ|α)η, βi =\r
Z\r
(ξ|α)\r
∗\r
(η|β)dλ\r
hα, Tξ,ηβi = hα,(η|β)ξi =\r
Z\r
(α|ξ)(η|β)dλ\r
\u0003\r
By Proposition 2.3 (4), the Tξ,η are bounded operators in H. Let us now assume\r
that all endomorphisms of the A-module H∞ are regular as in Definition 6.1. We\r
can then apply Proposition 6.5 and get that the following defines an essentially\r
self-adjoint operator with domain DomD,\r
(93) Dξ, η = Tη, ξ D Tξ, η\r
We need to relate this operator with the derivation of A given by (32) i.e.\r
(94) δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A\r
Lemma 6.7. One has\r
(95) Dξ, ηζ = −i δ0((η|ζ)) η + (ξ|Dξ)Tη, ηζ , ∀ξ, η, ζ ∈ H∞\r
The operator Vη(a) = aη, ∀a ∈ A extends to a bounded linear map Vη from\r
L\r
2\r
(X, dλ) to H, and one has\r
(96) V\r
∗\r
η Vη = (η|η), VηV\r
∗\r
η = Tη, η , V ∗η\r
(ζ) = (η|ζ), ∀ζ ∈ H∞\r
Proof. One has Dξ, ηζ = Tη, ξ D Tξ, ηζ = Tη, ξ D((η|ζ)ξ). Thus using (ξ, [D, a]ξ) =\r
−iδ0(a) and (ξ|aDξ)η = (ξ|Dξ)aη for a = (η|ζ) one gets\r
Dξ, ηζ = (ξ|Daξ)η = (ξ|[D, a]ξ)η + (ξ|Dξ)aη = −iδ0((η|ζ))η + (ξ|Dξ)Tη, ηζ\r
which gives (95). To show that Vη is bounded, note that\r
hVη(a), Vη(a)i = haη, aηi =\r
Z\r
−a\r
∗\r
a(η|η)|D|\r
−p =\r
Z\r
a\r
∗\r
a(η|η)dλ\r
which also shows that V\r
∗\r
η Vη = (η|η). Let us check that V\r
∗\r
η\r
(ζ) = (η|ζ). One has\r
hζ, Vη(a)i = hζ, aηi =\r
Z\r
a(ζ|η)dλ =\r
Z\r
(η|ζ)\r
∗\r
adλ = hV\r
∗\r
η\r

The equality VηV\r
∗\r
η = Tη, η follows from (91). \u0003\r
The strategy now is to use the self-adjointness of Dξ, η and the fact that δ0 can be\r
compared to iDξ, η plus a bounded perturbation to show that the resolvent problem\r
(1 + ǫδ0)ξ = η can be solved first in L\r
2\r
. Then one wants to use the regularity to\r
show that this problem can also be solved in the Sobolev spaces. Finally one wants\r
to use the Sobolev estimates to show that it can be solved in the C\r
∗ norm. Then\r
together with the results on dissipative derivations of §5 one gets the existence of\r
the resolvent for the action on the C\r
∗\r
-algebra. One notes that it is enough to\r
solve the resolvent problem for ǫ small enough. One then applies the Hille-Yoshida\r
Theorem.\r
27

More specifically we consider the equation\r
(97) (1 + iǫ(Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η))ζ = aη\r
where a ∈ A is given and ǫ can be taken as small as needed. Given a solution ζ\r
of (97), one can under suitable regularity conditions on ζ take the inner product\r
(η|ζ) = b. One then has, at the formal level\r
(98) b + ǫδ0(b)(η|η) = a(η|η)\r
We can assume that the support of ξ is small enough so that we can find η such\r
that (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood of the support K of ξ. Then by (94) one gets that\r
since δ0 vanishes outside K, one can replace δ0(b)(η|η) in (98) by δ0(b). Moreover\r
one then gets\r
(99) c + ǫδ0(c) = a , c = b + (1 − (η|η))a\r
since (1 − (η|η))a belongs to the kernel of δ0 since its support is disjoint from K.\r
We need to know that c ∈ A where A = C(X) is the norm closure of A and in fact\r
also that [D, c] is bounded, just to formulate the result. Thus we need to control\r
the Sobolev norms of the solution of (97). To do that we use the transformation\r
θλ of (70). One has, as in (72),\r
(100) θλ(T ) = T + Eλ(T ), Eλ(T ) = [D2, T ](D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
so that the binomial formula expresses θ\r

Note also that, for T regular, and on DomD one has\r
(102) [D\r

2\r
(T )\r
as follows from [D2, T ] = [|D|\r

Lemma 6.8. Let T be regular.\r
1) The E\r
k\r
λ\r
(T ) are compact operators for k > 0 and converge in norm to 0 when\r
λ → ∞.\r
2) One has (with λ ≥ 1)\r
(103) kEλ(T )Dk ≤ 2kδ(T )k+kδ\r
2\r
(T )k , kDEλ(T )k ≤ 2kδ(T )k+3kδ\r
2\r
(T )k+kδ\r
3\r
(T )k\r
3) For k > 1, the operators DE\r
k\r
λ\r
(T ) and E\r
k\r
λ\r
(T )D are compact operators which\r
converge in norm to 0 when λ → ∞.\r
Proof. 1) One has, using (100) and (102), that\r
(104) Eλ(T ) = (2δ(T )|D| + δ\r
2\r
(T ))(D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
Thus the answer follows for k = 1 since both (D2 + λ)\r
−1 and |D|(D2 + λ)−1 are\r
compact operators which converge in norm to 0 when λ → ∞. Since Eλ(T ) is also\r
regular it follows also for k > 1.\r
2) The first inequality of (103) follows from (104). For the second, one has\r
[|D|, Eλ(T )] = Eλ(δ(T ))\r
which gives (103) using,\r
kDEλ(T )k ≤ kEλ(T )|D|k + kEλ(δ(T ))k\r
and the second inequality follows using the first and (104).\r
28

3) The statement is immediate for E\r
k\r
λ\r
(T )D since |D|(D2 + λ)\r
−1\r
is compact. For\r
the second one uses [|D|, E\r
k\r

k\r

(δ(T )) as in the proof of 2). \u0003\r
Lemma 6.9. 1) For any integer N ∈ N, there exists λ < ∞ and ǫ0 > 0 such that\r

(1 + iǫSξ, η))−1k ≤ 1 + Ncξ, ηǫ ,\r
where cξ, η < ∞ only depends on ξ and η.\r
2) For any integer N there exists ǫN > 0 such that (97) can be solved in HN =\r
Dom|D|\r
N .\r
Proof. The operator P = (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η is bounded and regular since it is an endo\u0002morphism of the A-module H∞. Thus it preserves the domain of (D2 + λ)\r
N and\r
the E\r
k\r
λ\r
(P) are compact operators for k > 0 and converge in norm to 0 when λ → ∞\r
by Lemma 6.8. By (93), one has Dξ, η = Tη, ξ D Tξ, η thus, by regularity of the Tξ, η,\r
the operator\r

there exists Cξ, η < ∞ only depending on ξ and η such that\r

2) Let ξ = aη ∈ H2N , and consider ξ\r

statement, one can find a sequence ζn ∈ DomD, ζn → ζ\r
′ ∈ H such that\r

−N ζn → ξ .\r
One has ζ = (D2 + λ)\r
−N ζ′ ∈ H2N ⊂ DomD and (D2 + λ)−N ζn → (D2 + λ)−N ζ′\r
in the topology of DomD. Thus\r
(1 + iǫ(Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η))ζ = ξ\r
and ζ ∈ H2N gives the required solution. \u0003\r
We now need to show that if η ∈ H∞ and ζ ∈ HN for N large enough, the inner\r
product (η|ζ) gives an element of A = C(X) and in fact in the domain of δ\r
k\r

see this we use Proposition 2.3. We recall that the Sobolev norms on A are defined\r
using generators ηµ of the A-module H∞ by (13) i.e.\r

Thus when we want to control the Sobolev norms of (η|ζ) we need to control the\r

The point then is that (η, ζ)ηµ = Tηµ, ηζ while the endomorphism Tηµ, η is regular\r

(Tηµ, η) is bounded and (with λ = 1) one gets:\r

Theorem 6.11. Let (A, H, D) be a strongly regular spectral triple with A commu\u0002tative, fulfilling the five conditions of §2. Then any derivation of A of the form (32)\r
i.e. δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A, is closable for the C\r
∗\r
-norm of A, and its closure\r
is the generator of a one-parameter group of automorphisms U(t) of A = C(X),\r
X = Spec(A).\r
Proof. By Corollary 5.14 the derivation δ0, with domain A ⊂ A, is dissipative for\r
the C\r
∗\r
-norm of A. Thus it is closable ([2] Proposition 1.4.7) and we let D(δ0) be\r
the domain of its closure. To apply the Hille-Yosida-Lumer-Phillips Theorem we\r
need to show that for sufficiently small ǫ one has\r
(112) (1 + ǫδ0)D(δ0) = A\r
By Corollary 5.14, we have\r
k(1 + ǫδ0)(x)k ≥ kxk , ∀x ∈ D(δ0)\r
Thus (1 + ǫδ0)D(δ0) is closed in norm and it is enough to show that (1 + ǫδ0)A is\r
norm dense in A. Let then η ∈ H∞ be such that (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood of the\r
support of ξ (with δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ)). Let then N ∈ N be such that the Sobolev\r
estimate holds (Proposition 2.3)\r

Let a ∈ A one has aη ∈ H∞. By Lemma 6.9 there exists ǫN+1 > 0 such that for\r
any ǫ ≤ ǫN+1 one can find a solution in ζ ∈ HN+1 of the equation (97). Since H∞\r
is dense in HN+1 we thus get a sequence ζn ∈ H∞ such that ζn → ζ in HN+1. The\r
operator Sξ, η = Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η) is continuous from HN+1 to HN . One thus\r
has, with convergence in HN :\r
(1 + iǫSξ, η)ζn → (1 + iǫSξ, η)ζ = aη\r
Combining Lemma 6.10 with (113), one gets that the bn = (η|ζn) ∈ A converge in\r
the C\r
∗\r
-norm kxk. Moreover, by (95) and (105),\r
Sξ, ηζn = −i δ0((η|ζn)) η , (1 + iǫSξ, η)ζn = ζn + ǫδ0(bn) η → aη\r
with convergence in HN . Thus applying (η|•) and using (111) and (113),\r
bn + ǫδ0(bn)(η|η) → a(η|η)\r
in the C\r
∗\r
-norm, as in (98). Since (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood of the support of\r
ξ one has δ0(bn)(η|η) = δ0(bn). Moreover one has, since (1 − (η|η))a vanishes in a\r
neighborhood of the support of ξ that δ0((1−(η|η))a) = 0 . Thus we have the norm\r
convergence\r
cn + ǫδ0(cn) → a , cn = bn + (1 − (η|η))a\r
and this shows that (1 + ǫδ0)A is norm dense in A. Since (1 + ǫδ0)D(δ0) is norm\r
closed it is equal to A. Thus, we have shown that for sufficiently small ǫ one\r
has (112). Thus the Hille-Yosida-Lumer-Phillips Theorem ([2] Theorem 1.5.2, [21]\r
Theorem X.47 a) shows that δ0 generates a contraction semi-group of A. Since the\r
same holds for −δ0, one gets a one parameter group of isometries U(t) = e\r
tδ0 of\r
the C\r
∗\r
-algebra A. Moreover U(t)(a) is a norm continuous function of t for fixed\r
a ∈ A. Using the operators of the form\r
(114) U(f) = Zf(t)U(t)dt : A → A\r
for f such that the L\r
1\r
-norms of the derivatives kf\r
(n)k1 fulfill P t\r
n\r
n!\r
kf\r
(n)k1 < ∞,\r
one gets a dense domain of analytic elements and one checks that since δ0 is a\r
derivation on D(δ0) the U(t) are automorphisms of A. \u0003\r
It remains to show that the U(t) ∈ Aut(A) respect the smoothness. Let us first\r
show that we need only understand what happens to U(t)(a)η as an element of H\r
because U(t) is the identity in the complement of the support of ξ.\r
Lemma 6.12. Let x ∈ A have support disjoint from the support of ξ. Then\r
U(t)(x) = x for all t ∈ R.\r
Proof. We can assume that x ∈ A. Let us show that δ0(x) = 0. There exists\r
φ ∈ A with x = xφ2 and φξ = 0. One has δ0(x) = i(ξ|[D, x]ξ) and [D, x] =\r
[D, x]φ\r
2 + 2x[D, φ]φ so that [D, x]ξ = 0 and δ0(x) = 0. It follows that for f as in\r
(114), one gets δ0(U(f)(x)) = 0 since U(f) commutes with δ0. With f analytic\r
for L\r
1 one gets that U(f)(x) is an analytic element such that δ0(U(f)(x)) = 0 and\r
hence δ\r
n\r
0\r
(U(f)(x)) = 0 for all n ≥ 1. It follows that\r
U(t)(U(f)(x)) = X t\r
n\r
n!\r
δ\r
n\r
0\r
(U(f)(x)) = U(f)(x), ∀t ∈ R\r
Thus since U(fn)(x) → x in norm for a suitable sequence fn, one gets that\r
U(t)(x) = x for all t ∈ R. \u0003\r

Lemma 6.13. Let S be the closure of Sξ, η = Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η as an unbounded\r
operator in H. Then for any a ∈ Domδ0 one has aη ∈ DomS and\r
(115) S(aη) = −iδ0(a)η\r
For any a ∈ A and ǫ > 0, let b = (1 + ǫδ0)\r
−1\r
(a). Then bη ∈ DomS and\r
(116) (1 + iǫS)(bη) = aη\r
Proof. For an → a and δ0(an) → δ0(a) in norm one has anη → aη and δ0(an)η →\r
δ0(a)η in H. Thus, since S is closed and A is a core for δ0 it is enough to prove\r
(115) for a ∈ A. In that case one gets\r
S(aη) = Sξ, η(aη) = ((ξ|D(a(η|η)ξ)) − (ξ|Dξ)(η|aη)) η\r
One has a(η|η)ξ = aξ since (η|η) = 1 on the support of ξ. Similarly (ξ|Dξ)(η|aη) =\r
(ξ|Dξ)a = (ξ|aDξ). Thus we get\r
S(aη) = (ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A ,\r
which gives (115).\r
To prove (116), note that by Theorem 6.11 the resolvent (1 + ǫδ0)\r
−1\r
exists for any\r
ǫ > 0 and maps A to the domain of δ0. Thus applying the first part of the Lemma\r
to b = (1 + ǫδ0)\r
−1\r
(a), one gets\r
(1 + iǫS)(bη) = bη + iǫ(−iδ0(b)η) = ((1 + ǫδ0)b)η = aη\r
which gives (116). \u0003\r
Lemma 6.14. The one parameter group U(t) ∈ Aut(A) fulfills for each N an\r

with λ > 0 determined by Lemma 6.9. We let ǫ0 > 0 be as in Lemma 6.9. By (116)\r
one has for any a ∈ A\r

Now for t > 0 and with norm convergence in A one has,\r
U(−t)a = limn→∞(1 + tδ0\r

−n\r
(a).\r
32

This shows that U(−t)a is the norm limit of the sequence an = (1 + tδ0\r

−n(a) and\r
moreover one has, from (119), kank\r

(120) lim sup kank\r

Since an → b = U(−t)a in norm, one has anη → bη also in norm in H. Since the\r
operator (D2 + λ)\r
N/2\r
is closed, and by (120) the (D2 + λ)\r
N/2anη are uniformly\r
bounded, it follows that bη ∈ Dom(D2 + λ)\r
N/2 and thus kU(−t)aksobolev\r
N, η, λ < ∞.\r
More precisely we get\r

Now the semi-norm kak\r

N, η, λ is not equivalent to the Sobolev norm but the latter\r
is equivalent to the sum\r

N/2\r
aηµk\r
where one can choose the ηµ so that their supports are disjoint from the support of\r
ξ. This can be seen using the strong regularity. It then follows from Lemma 6.12,\r
that the semi-norm Pk(D2+λ)\r
N/2aηµk is preserved by U(t) since U(t)(a)ηµ = aηµ\r
for all µ. Thus one obtains (117). \u0003\r
Theorem 6.15. Let (A, H, D) be a strongly regular spectral triple with A commu\u0002tative, fulfilling the five conditions of §2. Then any derivation of A of the form\r
(32) i.e. δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A, is the generator of a one-parameter group of\r
automorphisms σt ∈ Aut(A) such that\r
• ∂tσt(a) = δ0(σt(a)).\r
• The map (t, a) ∈ R × A 7→ σt(a) ∈ A is jointly continuous.\r
Proof. By Lemma 6.14, the one parameter group U(t) ∈ Aut(A) preserves the\r
subalgebra A ⊂ A. We let σt ∈ Aut(A) be the corresponding automorphisms. For\r
a ∈ A one has a ∈ Domδ0 and thus\r
σt(a) − a =\r
Z t\r
0\r
σu(δ0(a))du\r
where σu(δ0(a)) is a norm continuous function of u. By (117) applied to δ0(a), this\r
shows that kσt(a) − ak\r

N = O(|t|) when t → 0. One has\r

(σt(a) − a) − δ0(a) = 1\r

0\r
(σu(δ0(a)) − δ0(a))du\r
which, since kσu(δ0(a)) − δ0(a)k\r

k\r
1\r
t\r
(σt(a) − a) − δ0(a)k\r
sobolev\r
N = O(|t|), for t → 0 .\r
This shows that ∂tσt(a) = δ0(σt(a) in the Frechet space A. Let us check the joint\r
continuity of (t, a) 7→ σt(a). Let (tn, an) → (t, a) ∈ R×A. One has σtn(an)−σt(a) =\r
σtn\r
(an − a) + σtn(a) − σt(a). The norm kσtn\r
(a) − σt(a)k\r
sobolev\r
N converges to 0 from\r
the above discussion. Moreover Lemma 6.14 shows that one controls the Sobolev\r
norms of σtn\r
(an −a) from those of (an −a) which gives the required continuity. \u0003\r
We can now also prove directly the absolute continuity of the transformed measure\r

Proposition 6.16. Let (A, H, D), δ0 and σt be as in Theorem 6.15. Then for each\r
t ∈ R the measure λ of (5) is strongly8equivalent to its transform under σt.\r

(λ)(f) = λ(σt(f)) agrees with λ(f) whenever the support of f is disjoint from\r
the support of ξ. With η ∈ H∞ as above one has (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood\r
V of the support of ξ. To obtain the required strong equivalence, it is enough to\r
compare λ(σt(f)) and λ(f) for f and σt(f) with support contained in V . One then\r
has, using (2)\r
λ(σt(f)) = Z−σt(f)|D|\r

Let, as above, S be the closure of Sξ, η = Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η. It is by construction\r

By Theorem 6.15 and (115) the H-valued function t 7→ η(t) = σt(a)η solves the\r

dη(t)\r
dt = iSη(t), η(0) = aη , η(t) ∈ DomS , ∀t ∈ R .\r
This implies that d\r

(123) hη, σt(a)ηi = hη, eitS aηi = he\r

Note that S is not self-adjoint in general because of the additional term −(ξ|Dξ)Tη, η.\r

H∞ given by\r
(124) S − S\r

since Tη, η is self-adjoint by (92). We can now write a formula for e\r

−itS∗ = −itS + P with P = itρTη, η which is bounded which allows one to use\r
the expansional formula (121), with A = −itS, B = P. Now by (122) one has\r
e\r
itSη = η for all t ∈ R thus the left hand side of (121) applied to η gives e−itS∗\r

Let us compute the right hand side. We first show that\r

8µ is strongly equivalent to ν iff there is c > 0 with cν ≤ µ ≤ c\r

34

Indeed one has Tη, ηaη = (η|aη)η = a(η|η)η and since (η|η) = 1 on the support of\r
ρ (using (124)) one gets that ρTη, ηaη = ρa(η|η)η = ρaη. Thus (126) follows from\r
(122). We then get\r

bounded on compact sets of s, while the volume of the simplex Sn is 1/n!. Thus\r
h(t) ∈ A and combining (123) and (125) one has:\r
(128) hη, σt(f)ηi = he\r
−itS∗\r
η, fηi = hh(t)η, fηi = hη, h¯(t)fηi\r
so that we get, for all f with support in V ,\r
(129) λ(σt(f)) = λ(h¯(t)f)\r
Since, by construction one has h = 1 outside the support of ξ, (using Lemma 6.12),\r
equality (129) holds for all f ∈ A. The norm continuity kh(t)−1k → 0 when t → 0\r
(using (127)) then gives the required strong equivalence. \u0003\r

This measure is locally equivalent to the spectral measure of the representation of\r
A = C(X) in H. More precisely:\r
Lemma 7.1. For any open set V ⊂ X the following two measures are strongly\r
equivalent:\r
• The restriction λ|V to V of the measure λ of (130).\r
• The restriction to V of the spectral measure associated to a vector ξ ∈ H∞\r
whose A-valued inner product (ξ, ξ) is strictly positive on V .\r
Proof. By the condition of absolute continuity one has a relation of the form\r
hξ, aξi =\r
Z\r
− a(ξ, ξ)|D|\r
−p\r
and since (ξ, ξ) ∈ A is strictly positive on V , one gets the strong equivalence between\r
the restriction to V of the spectral measure associated to the vector ξ ∈ H∞ and\r
the measure λ|V of (130). \u0003\r

(2) For any t ∈ Bǫ one has\r

2\r
λ ≤ σt(λ) ≤ 2λ.\r
(3) Z1 = ∩Bǫ σtZ is a neighborhood of χ.\r
(4) Z2 = ∪Bǫ σtZ is contained in V .\r
Proof. Let σt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, W and Z as in Lemma 4.5. We can replace the\r
Z0 of Lemma 4.5 by any neighborhood of χ contained in Z0 and hence by a ball\r
centered at χ and contained in V ∩ Z0. We use a metric d on X compatible with\r
the topology (Proposition 2.3). Thus\r
Z = {κ ∈ X | d(κ, χ) < r}\r
and we can take r small enough so that\r
(134) {κ ∈ X | d(κ, χ) ≤ 3/2 r} ⊂ V\r
The continuity of the map (κ, t) 7→ σ\r
−1\r
t\r
(κ) = κ ◦ σt yields ǫ > 0 with Bǫ ⊂ W and\r
(135) d(κ, σ±1\r
t\r
(κ)) ≤ r/2 , ∀κ ∈ X , t ∈ Bǫ\r
Then the first statement (1) follows from Lemma 4.5, with (132) coming from the\r
continuity in κ. The second statement follows from (135) since for d(κ, χ) < r/2\r
one gets d(χ, σ−1\r
t\r
(κ)) < r and σ\r
−1\r
t\r
(κ) ∈ Z. Similarly the third statement follows\r
from (135) and (134). Finally (133) follows from Proposition 6.16 for ǫ small. \u0003\r
Lemma 7.3. Let V ⊂ X be an open set with V ⊂ Uα and λV (resp. λV\r
) be the\r
spectral measure of the restriction to V (resp. V ) of the representation of C(X) in\r
H. Then sα(λV ) is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on sα(V ) and there exists\r
c < ∞ such that\r
(136) Z\r
V\r
f ◦ sα dλV ≤ c\r
Z\r
sα(V )\r
f(x)dxp, ∀f ∈ C\r
+\r
c\r
(R\r
p\r
).\r
Proof. By Lemma 7.1, the spectral measure λV (resp. λV\r
) is equivalent to the\r
measure λ of (130) restricted to V (resp. V ). We show that\r
• For any χ ∈ V one can find a neighborhood Z1 of χ in Uα such that\r
sα(λ|Z1) ≤ c dxpfor some c < ∞.\r
• For any χ ∈ V one can find a neighborhood Z2 of χ in V such that\r
dsα(λ|Z2\r
)/dxp = ρ(x) > 0 in a neighborhood of sα(χ)\r
36

Let χ ∈ V . We apply Lemma 7.2 relative to V = Uα. We let σt, Z, Zj, ǫ and\r
ǫ\r
′ be as in Lemma 7.2. We can assume that for |t| < ǫ one has (133). Let then\r
h ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(Bǫ), h(t) ∈ [0, 1], be equal to 1 on Bǫ/2. By Lemma 7.2, for any κ ∈ Z, the\r
map t 7→ F(κ, t) = sα(σt(κ)) is a diffeomorphism Fκ of Bǫ with a neighborhood of\r
sα(κ) in R\r
p\r
. It follows then that for fixed κ the image in R\r
p of the measure h(t)dtp\r
,\r
is a smooth multiple gκ(u) of the Lebesgue measure dup,\r
(137) Z\r
Bǫ\r
f(F(κ, t))h(t)dtp =\r
Z\r
Rp\r
f(u)gκ(u)dup, ∀f ∈ Cc(R\r
p\r
).\r
The function gκ vanishes outside Fκ(Bǫ) and is given inside by\r
(138) gκ(u) = h(ψ(u))|dψ(u)/du|\r
where ψ is the inverse of the diffeomorphism Fκ and dψ(u)/du its Jacobian. The\r
continuity of the map κ 7→ Fκ gives a uniform upper bound\r
(139) gκ(u) ≤ c1 , ∀u ∈ R\r
p\r
, κ ∈ Z .\r
Since h = 1 on Bǫ/2 and sα(κ) + Bǫ\r
′ ⊂ Fκ(Bǫ/2) by (132), one has h(ψ(u)) = 1 for\r
u ∈ sα(y) + Bǫ\r
′ . The continuity of the map κ 7→ Fκ then yields ǫ1 > 0 such that\r
(140) gκ(u) ≥ ǫ1 , ∀u ∈ sα(κ) + Bǫ\r
′ , ∀κ ∈ Z\r
We consider the image dν under (κ, t) ∈ Z ×Bǫ 7→ F(κ, t) ∈ R\r
p of the finite positive\r
measure dλ(κ)h(t)dtp on Z × Bǫ. It is given by\r
(141) Z\r
Rp\r
f(x)dν(x) = Z\r
Z\r
Z\r
Bǫ\r
f(F(κ, t))h(t)dtpdλ(κ), ∀f ∈ Cc(R\r
p\r
),\r
and is equal, by (137), to\r
(142) Zf(x)dν(x) = Z Z f(u)gκ(u)dupdλ(κ) = Zf(u)ρ(u)dup\r
where\r
(143) ρ(u) = Z\r
Z\r
gκ(u)dλ(κ)\r
By (139) one has\r
(144) ρ(u) ≤ c1λ(Z) < ∞ , ∀u ∈ R\r
p\r
.\r
Moreover (140) shows that\r
(145) ρ(u) ≥ ǫ1λ({κ ∈ Z | |u − sα(κ)| < ǫ′}).\r
We then have\r
(146) ρ(u) > 0 , ∀u ∈ sα(Z).\r
This strict positivity follows from the condition of absolute continuity which shows\r
that the support of the measure λ is X. Indeed, for u ∈ sα(Z), the open set\r
{κ ∈ Z | |u − sα(κ)| < ǫ′} is non-empty and it has strictly positive measure. This\r
shows that the restriction of the measure ν to the open set sα(Z) is equivalent to\r
the Lebesgue measure.\r
We now use the quasi-invariance of dλ given by (133) to compare sα(λ|Zj) with ν.\r
Using (133) (for δ = 1/2), one has for t ∈ Bǫ,\r
1\r
2\r
dλ ≤ d(σt(λ)) ≤ 2dλ so that, for\r
37

any subset E ⊂ X and any positive f ∈ C\r

The middle term is\r

where we used Fubini’s theorem, and the equality sα(σt(κ)) = F(κ, t) for κ ∈ Z\r

hence the image sα(λ|Z1) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue\r
measure and is majorized by a constant multiple of Lebesgue measure. Thus, every\r
point of V has a neighborhood Z1 such that sα(λ|Z1\r
) ≤ c1dxp. Covering the\r
compact set V by finitely many such Z1 gives (136).\r
Let us now assume that χ ∈ V . We can then assume, by Lemma 7.2 that Z2 =\r
∪Bǫ σtZ is contained in V . One has Z ⊂ σ\r

By (146) one has ρ(u) > 0 for all u ∈ sα(Z) thus ρ(u) > 0 in a neighborhood\r
of sα(χ), in other words dsα(λ|Z2)/dxp = ρ2(x) > 0 in a neighborhood of sα(χ)\r
as required. This shows that sα(λ|V ) is equivalent to the Lebesgue measure on\r
sα(V ). \u0003\r

8. Spectral multiplicity\r
We want to get an upper bound for the number of elements in the fiber of the\r
map sα : Uα → R\r
p\r
. We shall first relate the multiplicity of the map sα with\r
the spectral multiplicity of the operators a\r
j\r
α in the Hilbert space H. This is not\r
automatic, indeed the first difficulty is that for an injective representation π of a\r
C\r
∗\r
-algebra B with a subalgebra A ⊂ B, one can have the same double-commutants\r
π(A)\r
′′ = π(B)′′ even though A 6= B. Thus for instance one can take the subalgebra\r
C[0, 1] ⊂ C(K) where K = {0, 1, . . ., 9}\r
N is the Cantor set of the decimal digits\r
and the inclusion is given by the decimal expansion. Both act in L\r
2\r
[0, 1] (by\r
multiplication) and the spectral multiplicity of the function x ∈ C[0, 1] is equal\r
to one but the number of elements in the fiber is equal to 2 for numbers of the form\r
k 10−n. The point in this example is that the projection map s : K → [0, 1] is not\r
an open mapping. Thus in particular the subset of K where the multiplicity of s is\r
two is not an open subset of K (it is countable).\r
Lemma 8.1. Let s : X → Y be a continuous open map of compact spaces. Then\r
the function n(y) = #s\r
−1\r
(y) is lower semicontinuous on Y .\r
Proof. Assume that n(y) ≥ m and let us show that this inequality still holds in a\r
neighborhood of y. Let xj ∈ X be m distinct points in s\r
−1\r
(y). One can then find\r
disjoint open sets Vj ∋ xj and let W = ∩j s(Vj ) which is an open neighborhood of\r
y. For any z ∈ W the preimage s\r
−1\r
(z) contains at least m points. \u0003\r
Now, let s : X → Y be a continuous open map of compact spaces. Let µ be a\r
positive measure on X with support X and π the corresponding representation of\r
C(X) in L\r
2\r
(X, µ). We want to compare the spectral multiplicity function Σ(y) of\r
the restriction of π to C(Y ) with n(y) = #s\r
−1\r
(y). Let ν = s(µ) be the image of\r
the measure µ. One can desintegrate µ in the form\r
µ =\r
Z\r
Y\r
ρy dν(y)\r
where the conditional measure ρy is supported by the closed subset s\r
−1\r
(y). The\r
issue is what is the dimension of the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
(X, ρy). It might seem at first\r
that if the support of the measure µ is X one should be able to conclude that the\r
support of ρy is s\r
−1\r
(y) and obtain that the spectral multiplicity function Σ(y) is\r
larger than n(y) = #s\r
−1\r
(y). However this fails as shown by the following example:\r
X = Y × {1, . . ., m} , s(y, k) = y\r
and let µk be the measure on Y corresponding to the restriction of µ to Y × {k}.\r
Lemma 8.2. If the measures µk are mutually singular then the spectral multiplicity\r
function Σ(y) is equal to 1 a.e. .\r
Proof. The representations of C(Y ) in L\r
2\r
(Y, µk) are pairwise disjoint, and each\r
is of multiplicity one. Thus the commutant of C(Y ) in the direct sum of these\r
representations only contains block diagonal operators and is hence commutative\r
so that the multiplicity is equal to one. \u0003\r
The above example gives the needed condition for the relation between Σ(y) and\r
n(y) and one has:\r
39

Lemma 8.3. Let X be a compact space and λ a finite positive measure on X, π\r
the representation9of C(X) in L\r
2\r
(X, dλ). Let aj = a\r
∗\r
j ∈ C(X) and s the map from\r
X to R\r
p with coordinates aj . We let U ⊂ X be an open set and ν a measure on Rp\r
and assume that\r
• The restriction of s to U is an open mapping.\r
• For every open subset V ⊂ U the image s(λ|V ) is equivalent to the restric\u0002tion of ν to s(V ).\r
Let then V ⊂ U be an open set and consider the operators Tj = π(aj )|V obtained\r
by restriction of the π(aj ) to the subspace L\r
2\r
(V, dλ) ⊂ L\r
2\r
(X, dλ). Then the joint\r
spectral measure of the Tj is ν|s(V ) and the spectral multiplicity Σ(y) fulfills\r
(150) Σ(y) ≥ n(y) = #{s\r
−1\r
(y) ∩ V } , ∀y ∈ s(V ),\r
almost everywhere modulo ν.\r
Proof. Let W = s(V ) which is a bounded open set in R\r
p\r
. One can desintegrate\r
λ|V in the form\r
(151) λ|V =\r
Z\r
W\r
ρydν(y)\r
where the ρy are positive measures carried by Fy = s\r
−1\r
(y)∩V . Moreover the total\r
mass of ρy is > 0 almost everywhere modulo ν for y ∈ s(V ). This follows from the\r
assumed equivalence s(λ|V ) ∼ ν|s(V ). One then has\r
L\r
2\r
(V, dλ) = Z ⊕\r
W\r
L\r
2\r
(Fy, ρy)dν(y)\r
For any ξ ∈ L\r
2\r
(V, dλ) and any f ∈ Cc(R\r
p\r
) one has\r
hξ, f((aj ))ξi =\r
Z\r
W\r
Z\r
Fy\r
|ξ(x)|\r
2\r
dρyf(y)dν(y)\r
which shows that the joint spectral measure of the aj is absolutely continuous with\r
respect to ν|W . Its equivalence with ν|W follows from (151) taking ξ(x) = 1 and\r
using the assumed equivalence of s(λ|V ) with the restriction of ν to s(V ).\r
Let us prove (150). Let y ∈ W with n(y) = #{s\r
−1\r
(y)∩V } ≥ m > 0. Let xj ∈ V be\r
m distinct points in s\r
−1\r
(y) ∩ V . One can then find disjoint open sets Bj ∋ xj and\r
let Z = ∩j s(Bj ) which is an open neighborhood of y. For any z ∈ Z the preimage\r
s\r
−1\r
(z) ∩ V contains at least m points since it contains at least one in each Bj .\r
Moreover one has s(s\r
−1\r
(Z) ∩ Bj ) = Z for all j. Let λj be the restriction of λ to\r
Vj = s\r
−1\r
(Z)∩Bj. From the first part of the Lemma, for each j the spectral measure\r
of the action of the aj in L\r
2\r
(Vj , dλj ) is the restriction ν|s(Vj ) = νZ. The action of\r
the aj in L\r
2\r
(V, dλj ) contains the direct sum of the actions in the L\r
2\r
(Vj , dλj ) and\r
hence a copy of the action of the coordinates yj in\r
⊕\r
m\r
1 L\r
2\r
(Z, νZ)\r
which shows that the spectral multiplicity fulfills Σ(z) ≥ m a.e. on the neighbor\u0002hood Z of y. This shows that any element y in the open set Um = {y ∈ U | n(y) ≥\r
m} admits an open neighborhood Zy where Σ(z) ≥ m holds a.e. Since Um is σ\u0002compact it follows that Σ(y) ≥ m almost everywhere modulo ν on Um so that (150)\r
holds. \u0003\r
9by multiplication\r
40

Remark 8.4. With the hypothesis of Lemma 8.3, let E be a complex hermit\u0002ian vector bundle over X with non-zero fiber dimension everywhere. Then the\r
inequality ΣE(y) ≥ n(y) holds, where ΣE is the spectral multiplicity of the Tj\r
acting on L\r
2\r
(X, dλ, E). This follows since, at the measurable level, one can find a\r
nowhere vanishing section of E which shows that the representation πE of C(X)\r
in L\r
2\r
(X, dλ, E) contains the representation π of C(X) in L\r
2\r
(X, dλ). Since πE is\r
contained in the sum of N copies of π, one obtains the conclusion.\r
Theorem 8.5. Let V ⊂ Uα be an open set and let a\r
j\r
α|V be the restriction of a\r
j\r
α ∈ A\r
to the range 1V H ⊂ H. Then\r
• The joint spectral measure of the a\r
j\r
α|V is the Lebesgue measure on sα(V ).\r
• The spectral multiplicity mac(y) fulfills\r
(152) mac(y) ≥ n(y) = #{s\r
−1\r
α (y) ∩ V } , ∀y ∈ sα(V ),\r
almost everywhere modulo the Lebesgue measure.\r
Proof. By Lemma 7.3 the hypothesis of Lemma 8.3 are fulfilled by the compact\r
space X with measure λ, the open set Uα, the measure dν = dxp and the elements\r
a\r
j\r
α. Thus the result follows from Lemma 8.3 and Remark 8.4. \u0003\r
9. Local form of the L\r
(p,1) estimate\r
We fix p ∈ [1, ∞[. Our goal is to control the size of the Lebesgue multiplicity mac(y)\r
which appears in Theorem 8.5. The idea here is to use a local form of the L\r
(p,1)\r
estimate of [9] Proposition IV.3.14, with the right hand side of the inequality now\r
involving a closed subset K ⊂ X, by\r
λ(K) = inf\r
b∈A+, b1K=1K\r
Z\r
−b|D|\r
−p\r
It relies on the estimate given in [8] and on the crucial results of Voiculescu ([25],\r
[26], [27]). The norm kT k(p,1) is defined10 for a compact operator T with charac\u0002teristic values µn(T ) in decreasing order by (cf. [25] p. 5)\r
(153) kT k(p,1) =\r
X∞\r
1\r
n\r
−1+1/pµn\r
In order to get an upper bound on kT k(p,1) for T an operator of finite rank, we can\r
use an inequality of the form\r
(154) kT k(p,1) ≤ Cp (Rank T )\r
1/p kT k∞\r
which follows using the characteristic values µn(T ) from\r
kT k(p,1) =\r
X\r

where N = Rank T . Note also that the L\r
(p,1) norm fulfills\r
(155) kATBk(p,1) ≤ kAk∞kT k(p,1)kBk∞ .\r
10For p = 1 it agrees with the L1\r

Let D be a self-adjoint unbounded operator such that its resolvent is an infinitesimal\r
of order 1/p i.e. is such that the characteristic values fulfill µn(|D|\r
−1\r
) = O(n\r
−1/p).\r
We let for any λ > 0,\r
(156) P(λ) = 1[0,λ](|D|), α(λ) = TrP(λ).\r
By construction α(λ) is a non decreasing integer valued function. The hypothesis\r
µn(|D|\r
−1\r
) = O(n\r
−1/p) implies µn(|D|−1\r
) < Cn−1/p for some C < ∞ and it follows\r
that α(C\r
−1n1/p) < n, since the n-th eigenvalue of |D| in increasing order is >\r
C\r
−1n1/p. Thus, using for n the smallest integer above Cp λp\r
, we get\r
(157) α(λ) ≤ C\r
p λp\r
, ∀λ > 0 .\r
Let us show that\r
Lemma 9.1. Let f ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(R), then there is a finite constant Cf such that\r
(158) k[f(ǫD), a]k∞ ≤ Cf ǫk[D, a]k , ∀a ∈ A .\r
Under the hypothesis of Theorem 8.5, one has:\r
(159) lim inf λ\r
−pα(λ) > 0 .\r
Proof. One has\r
(160) [e\r
isǫD, a] = isǫ Z 1\r
0\r
e\r
iusǫD[D, a]ei(1−u)sǫDdu\r
which gives (158) using the finiteness of R|s\r

(161) [f(ǫD), a] = (2π)\r

Z\r
ˆf(s)[e\r

Assume that (159) does not hold. Then let λn → ∞ be such that lim λ\r
−p\r
n α(λn) = 0.\r
Let f ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(R) be an (even) cutoff function vanishing outside [−1, 1]. For ǫn = λ\r
−1\r
n\r
one has\r
Rank f(ǫnD) ≤ α(λn), Rank [f(ǫnD), a] ≤ 2α(λn)\r
so that by (154) one gets, using (158),\r
k[f(ǫnD), a]k(p,1) ≤ Cp(2α(λn))1/pCǫnk[D, a]k\r
and since lim λ\r

The Voiculescu obstruction relative to an ideal J of compact operators is given by\r

where R+\r
1\r
is the partially ordered set of positive, finite rank operators of norm less\r
than one, in H. We take An = f(ǫnD). It is by construction an element of R+\r
1\r
.\r
Moreover since f(ǫnD) → 1 strongly in H this shows that for the ideal J = L\r
(p,1)\r
one gets kJ ({aj}) = 0. This contradicts the existence, shown in Theorem 8.5, of p\r
self-adjoint elements aj of A whose joint spectral measure is the Lebesgue measure,\r
using Theorem 4.5 of [25] which gives the equality, valid for p self-adjoint operators\r

The rank of the operator T = [f(ǫD), a] is controlled by twice the rank of f(ǫD).\r
We take f compactly supported and thus f ≤ g where g is equal to one on the\r
support of f yields an inequality of the form\r
(165) Rank f(ǫD) ≤ Tr(g(ǫD))\r
One has by Corollary 14.10 (Appendix 2) an estimate of the form\r
(166) lim inf ǫ\r

This gives\r

Lemma 9.2. Let f ∈ C∞\r

Proof. Using (167), and Rank [f(ǫD), a] ≤ 2Rank f(ǫD) one gets a sequence ǫq → 0\r

We now let K ⊂ X be a compact subset and we want to localize the estimate (168)\r
to K i.e. to the range of K in H.\r
Lemma 9.3. 11 Let h ∈ C∞\r
c\r

where δ(a) = [|D|, a] and one assumes that a ∈ ∩2\r

Proof. First one has (cf. Corollary 10.16 of [14]),\r

(a)k\r
with a similar estimate using ǫδ(a)h\r

(ǫ|D|). Indeed, using (161) with |D| instead\r
of D, one gets\r
[h(ǫ|D|), a] = (2π)\r
−1\r
Z\r
hˆ(s)[e\r

11This is Lemma 10.29 in [14], but the proof given there is not correct, so we give the full\r

one gets\r

We follow the proof of Lemma 10.29 in [14]. One has\r
[f(ǫ|D|), a] −\r
1\r
2\r
ǫ(f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)δ(a) + δ(a)f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)) = AǫBǫ + CǫAǫ\r
where Aǫ = h(ǫ|D|), Bǫ = [h(ǫ|D|), a] − ǫh′(ǫ|D|)δ(a) and Cǫ = [h(ǫ|D|), a] −\r
ǫδ(a)h\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|). By (170) one has kBǫk = O(ǫ\r
2\r
), kCǫk = O(ǫ\r
2\r
), while Aǫ is uniformly\r
bounded with Rank Aǫ = O(ǫ\r
−p\r
). Thus by (154) one has kAǫk(p,1) = O(ǫ\r
−1\r
). Thus\r
we get the required estimate using (155). \u0003\r
We then let K ⊂ X be a compact subset, as above, and consider the operators\r
(171) Rǫ = 1K f(ǫ|D|) 1K\r
We let b ∈ A be equal to 1 on K i.e. such that b 1K = 1K. One then has:\r
Lemma 9.4.\r
(172) k[Rǫ, a] −\r

ǫ(1K f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)bδ(a)1K + 1K δ(a)bf′(ǫ|D|)1K )k(p,1) = O(ǫ)\r
Proof. One has\r
[Rǫ, a] = 1K [f(ǫ|D|), a] 1K\r
since a commutes with 1K. Thus multiplying on both sides by 1K in (169), one\r
gets (using (155))\r
(173) k[Rǫ, a] −\r
1\r
2\r
ǫ(1K f\r

(ǫ|D|)δ(a)1K + 1K δ(a)f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)1K )k(p,1) = O(ǫ)\r
Lemma 9.1 and (157) show, using (154), that one has a uniform upper bound\r
k[f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|), b]k(p,1) ≤ Ck[|D|, b]k\r
since f\r
′ has compact support. Thus in (173) one can replace 1K f′\r
(ǫ|D|) = 1K b f′(ǫ|D|)\r
by 1K f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)b, without affecting the behavior in O(ǫ). The same applies to the\r
other term. \u0003\r
We recall the interpolation inequality used in [9] §IV.2.δ, but stated without proof\r
there.\r
Lemma 9.5. There exists for 1 ≤ p < ∞, a constant cp such that, for S ∈ L1,\r
(174) kSk(p,1) ≤ cpkSk\r
1/p\r
1\r
kSk\r
1−1/p\r
∞\r
Proof. The inequality holds as an equality for p = 1 with c1 = 1, thus we can\r
assume that p > 1. We use the fact that L\r
(p,1) is obtained by real interpolation\r
of index (θ, 1) for θ =\r
1\r
p\r
from the Banach spaces Y0 = K and Y1 = L\r
1\r
. The\r
functoriality of the interpolation gives an inequality of the form\r
kT (x)k(Y0,Y1)(θ,q) ≤ M1−θ\r
0 Mθ\r
1 kxk(X0,X1)(θ,q)\r
for any linear operator from X0 + X1 to Y0 + Y1 such that\r
kTxkYi ≤ MikxkXi\r
, ∀x ∈ Xi, i = 0, 1\r
We can take X0 = X1 = C and let T be such that T (1) = S. Then M0 = kSk∞,\r
M1 = kSk1 and the norm kxk(X0,X1)(θ,1) is finite and non-zero. \u0003\r
44

Remark 9.6. In order not to depend on interpolation theory we give a direct proof\r
of (174). We assume that p > 1. First, for p > 1 an equivalent norm on L\r
(p,1) is\r
(175) kT k(p,1)′ = (1 − θ)\r
XN\r
θ−2σN (T ), θ =\r
1\r
p\r
.\r
where σN (T ) is the sum of the first N characteristic values. The equivalence of the\r
norms (175) and (153) follows from µN ≤ σN /N one way. For the other way, one\r
applies Fubini to the double sum\r
X\r
n\r
X\r
m≥n\r
µnmθ−2 =\r
X\r
m\r
X\r
n≤m\r
µnmθ−2.\r
Now to estimate (175) assuming kT k∞ ≤ 1 and kT k1 = ρ ≥ 1, one splits the sum\r
as follows\r
X∞\r
1\r
N\r
θ−2σN (T ) = X\r
N<ρ\r
N\r
θ−2σN (T ) + X\r
N≥ρ\r
N\r
θ−2σN (T ).\r
Using kT k∞ ≤ 1 gives σN (T ) ≤ N and one bounds the first sum as\r
X\r
N<ρ\r
N\r
θ−2N ∼ Cθ ρθ\r
Using kT k1 = ρ ≥ 1 gives σN (T ) ≤ ρ and one bounds the second sum by\r
X\r
N≥ρ\r
N\r
θ−2\r
ρ ∼ C\r
′\r

which gives the required inequality (174).\r
Lemma 9.7. There exists a constant Cf ≤ ∞ such that for b = b\r

c\r

kbh(ǫ|D|)bk1 = Tr(bh(ǫ|D|)b) = Tr(b\r

and the result follows from Corollary 14.10 (Appendix 2) which gives,\r

Theorem 9.9. There exits a finite constant κp such that for any operators aj ∈ A\r
and compact subset K ⊂ X one has, with J = L\r
(p,1), the inequality\r
(178) kJ ({aj 1K}) ≤ κp max kδ(aj )k∞(λ(K))1/p\r
where one lets12:\r

Proof. By definition one has\r
kJ ({aj 1K}) = lim inf\r

max k[A, aj 1K]kJ\r
where R\r
+\r
1\r
is the partially ordered set of positive, finite rank operators of norm less\r
than one, in 1K H. We take Rǫ = 1K f(ǫ|D|) 1K as in (171). It is by construction\r
an element of R\r
+\r
1\r
. Moreover since f(ǫ|D|) → 1 strongly in H one gets that Rǫ → 1\r
strongly in 1K H. By Lemma 9.4 one has\r
k[Rǫ, a] −\r
1\r
2\r
ǫ(1K f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)bδ(a)1K + 1K δ(a)bf′(ǫ|D|)1K )k(p,1) = O(ǫ)\r
Using\r
1K f\r
′\r
(ǫ|D|)bδ(a)1K = 1K b f′(ǫ|D|)bδ(a)1K\r
and (155) for A = 1K, T = b f′(ǫ|D|)b, B = δ(a)1K and similarly for the other\r
term, one gets an estimate of the form\r
k[Rǫ, a]k(p,1) ≤ O(ǫ) + kǫbf′(ǫ|D|)bk(p,1)kδ(a)k∞\r
Thus, by Lemma 9.8 one gets that, for any b ∈ A+ equal to 1 on K, there exists a\r
sequence ǫq → 0 such that\r

After varying b one obtains the required estimate. \u0003\r
Remark 9.10. a) One may worry that Voiculescu’s definition of kJ involves the\r
ordered set R+\r
1 while all we got was Rǫ → 1 strongly in 1K H. Thus let us briefly\r
mention how to get the A ↑ 1 from Rǫ by a small modification. Given a finite\r
12This is the natural extension of λ given by the Riesz representation Theorem [23].\r
46

dimensional subspace of 1K H, one lets P be the corresponding finite rank projec\u0002tion, with fixed rank N. One needs to construct A ∈ R+\r
1\r
, A ≥ P with a control on\r
max k[A, aj 1K]kJ . One takes\r
Aǫ = P + (1 − P)Rǫ(1 − P),\r
so that A ≥ P by construction. Moreover one has\r
(179) Rǫ − Aǫ = P(Rǫ − 1)P + PRǫ(1 − P) + (1 − P)RǫP .\r
Moreover by the strong convergence Rǫ → 1, one has\r
kP(Rǫ − 1)k∞ = k(Rǫ − 1)Pk∞ → 0\r
so that all three terms in the rhs of (179) converge to 0 in norm and hence in the\r
J norm since their rank is less than N so that one can use (154). Thus one has\r
kRǫ − AǫkJ → 0\r
and one controls max k[A, aj 1K]kJ from max k[Rǫ, aj 1K]kJ .\r
b) It might seem possible at first sight to tensor the spectral triple (A, H, D) by\r
(C, H′, D′), with the spectrum of D′ growing fast enough so that the product triple13\r
(180) (A ⊗ C, H ⊗ H′, D′′ = D ⊗ 1 + γ ⊗ D\r
′\r
)\r
would still be of dimension p, i.e. such that the characteristic values of the inverse\r
of D′′ are O(n\r
−1/p). Let us show that this is only possible if the dimension of H′\r
is finite. Indeed the eigenvalues of (D ⊗ 1 + γ ⊗ D′)\r
2 = D2 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ D\r
′\r
2 are the\r
independent sums of the eigenvalues of D2 and of D\r
′\r
2\r
. Thus having infinitely many\r
eigenvalues of D\r
′\r
2\r
contradicts the two inequalities\r
α(λ) ≥ cλp, α′′(λ) ≤ C\r
′′λp\r
for the counting functions α(λ) = Tr(1[0,λ](|D|), α\r
′′(λ) = Tr(1[0,λ](|D′′|) since they\r
yield\r
dim(H′) ≤ C\r
′′/c .\r
c) The constant C\r

in (177) is given, up to a function of p alone, by\r

and one needs to check that there is a lower bound to C\r
′\r
f\r
independently of the\r
choice of the cutoff function f. Since f(0) = 1 the only information is about\r
R ∞\r
0\r
h(u)du = 1 and thus one needs to show a general inequality of the form:\r

Z ∞\r

Next, assuming khk∞ = 1, one has g(v) ≤ 1 for all v > 0 and thus, with ρ = R ∞\r

Proof. Let W = sα(V ) and\r
m1 = sup\r
x∈W\r
#(s\r
−1\r
α (x) ∩ V )\r
which is finite (and non-zero) by Lemma 10.2. Let\r
W1 = {x ∈ W | #(s\r
−1\r
α (x) ∩ V ) = m1}\r
It is by Lemma 8.1 an open subset of W. Moreover for x ∈ W1 one can find m1\r
disjoint open neighborhoods Vj of the preimages xj of x such that all Vj surject on\r
the same neighborhood U of x in W. It follows that the restriction of sα to each\r
of the Vj is a bijection onto U and hence an isomorphism of a neighborhood of xj\r
with an open set in R\r
p given by the aj\r
α.\r
It can be that W1 is not dense in W, but then we just take the complement of its\r
closure: W1 = W\\W1 and let\r
m2 = sup\r
x∈W1\r
#(s\r
−1\r
α (x) ∩ V )\r
which is < m1 by construction. One then defines\r
W2 = {x ∈ W1| #(s\r
−1\r
α (x) ∩ V ) = m2}\r
49

which is by Lemma 8.1 an open subset of W1\r
. The same argument as above shows\r
that the subset Z = W1 ∪ W2 fulfills the condition of the Lemma. One proceeds in\r
the same way and gets, by induction, a sequence Wk, with Y = ∪Wj fulfilling the\r
condition of the Lemma. Since the sequence mj is strictly decreasing one gets that\r
the process stops and Y is dense in W. \u0003\r
11. Reconstruction Theorem\r
We shall now use Lemma 10.3 together with the ability to move around in X by\r
automorphisms of A to prove the following key Lemma:\r
Lemma 11.1. For every point χ ∈ X there exists p real elements x\r
µ ∈ A and a\r
smooth family τt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, τ0 = Id, such that\r
• The x\r
µ give an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of χ with an open set in\r
R\r
p\r
.\r
• The map t 7→ h(t) = χ ◦ τt is an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of 0 in\r
R\r
p with a neighborhood of χ.\r
• The map x ◦ h is a local diffeomorphism.\r
Proof. Let χ ∈ X. By Lemma 4.4, there exists α such that χ ∈ Uα. By Lemma\r
4.5, there exists a smooth family σt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, a neighborhood Z of χ in\r
X = Spec(A) and a neighborhood W of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
such that, for any κ ∈ Z, the\r
map t 7→ sα(κ ◦ σt) is a diffeomorphism, depending continuously on κ, of W with\r
a neighborhood of sα(κ) in R\r
p\r
.\r
We now take for V a ball\r
V = Br = {y ∈ X | d(χ, y) < r} ⊂ Uα , V ⊂ Uα .\r
We apply Lemma 10.3 to V = Br and let Y be a dense open subset Y ⊂ sα(V )\r
such that every point of s\r
−1\r
α (Y ) ∩ V has a neighborhood N in X such that the\r
restriction of sα to N is an homeomorphism with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Since Y is\r
dense in sα(V ), and by Lemma 4.5 the image of W by t 7→ ψ(t) = sα(χ ◦ σt) is an\r
open neighborhood of sα(χ) one can choose a u0 ∈ W such that χ ◦ σu0 ∈ V and\r
ψ(u0) = sα(χ ◦ σu0) ∈ Y . One has κ = χ ◦ σu0 ∈ s\r
−1\r
α (Y ) ∩ V . Thus by Lemma\r
10.3 there exists a neighborhood N of κ such that the restriction of sα to N is an\r
isomorphism with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Thus the a\r
µ\r
α are good local coordinates near\r
κ. The automorphism σu0 ∈ Aut(A) is such that\r
(189) κ = χ ◦ σu0, χ = σu0(κ)\r
Recall that we use the covariant notation (131). We take\r
(190) x\r
µ = σu0\r
(a\r
µ\r
α)\r
as local coordinates near χ. The corresponding map x from X = Spec(A) to R\r
p\r
is\r
given by\r
ζ ∈ X 7→ ζ(x\r
µ\r
) = ζ(σu0(a\r
µ\r
α)) = sα(ζ ◦ σu0\r
) = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
(ζ)\r
Thus x = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
and, since σu0is an homeomorphism of X, x = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
is an\r
homeomorphism of the neighborhood σu0(N) of χ with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Thus\r
the x\r
µ are good local coordinates at χ. Then let τt ∈ Aut(A) be given by\r
τt = σu0+t ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
50

so that τt ◦ σu0 = σu0+t. One has\r
χ ◦ τt(x\r
µ\r
) = χ ◦ τt(σu0(a\r
µ\r
α)) = χ ◦ σu0+t(a\r
µ\r
α) = s\r
µ\r
α(χ ◦ σu0+t) = ψ\r
µ\r
(u0 + t)\r
Now the map h is given by t 7→ h(t) = χ ◦ τt thus one has\r
(191) x ◦ h(t) = ψ(u0 + t)\r
This shows that the map x ◦ h is a diffeomorphism from W1 = W − u0 (which\r
is a neighborhood of t = 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
since u0 ∈ W) with an open set of R\r
p\r
. On\r
W1, the map h is injective since x ◦ h is injective. Thus h is an homeomorphism\r
with its range. One has h(0) = χ, h is continuous thus W2 = h\r
−1\r
(σu0(N)) ∩\r
W1 is an open set containing 0 and W′\r
2 = x ◦ h(W2) is an open set in R\r
p\r
. The\r
map x is an homeomorphism of σu0\r
(N) with an open set in R\r
p and x ◦ h is an\r
homeomorphism of W1 with an open set in R\r
p\r
. One has h(W2) ⊂ σu0(N). Thus\r
h(W2) = x\r
−1\r
(W′\r
2\r
) ∩ σu0(N) is open in σu0(N) and since it contains h(0) = χ we\r
get that h is an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of 0 in R\r
p with a neighborhood\r
of χ. Moreover, as we have seen above, the map x ◦ h is a diffeomorphism. \u0003\r
Lemma 11.2. The algebra A is locally the algebra of restrictions of smooth func\u0002tions on R\r
p\r
to a bounded open set of R\r
p\r
.\r
Proof. Let χ ∈ X. By Lemma 11.1, we can assume that some x\r
µ ∈ A give an\r
homeomorphism of a neighborhood U of χ with a bounded open set x(U) ⊂ R\r
p\r
.\r
By the smooth functional calculus the algebra C∞\r
c\r
(x(U)) is contained in A using\r
the morphism f ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(x(U)) 7→ f(x\r
µ) ∈ A . Moreover for any κ ∈ U one has\r
κ(f(x\r
µ\r
)) = f(κ(x\r
µ\r
) so that the function f ◦ x coincides on U with the element\r
f(x\r
µ) ∈ A. Taking a smaller neighborhood V of χ with compact closure in U one\r
gets that the algebra C∞(R\r
p\r
)|x(V ) of restrictions to x(V ) of smooth functions on R\r
p\r
is contained in the algebra of restrictions to V of elements of A, using x to identify\r
V with the open set x(V ) ⊂ R\r
p\r
. We need to show that any element of A restricts\r
to a smooth function on V , using the local coordinates x to define smoothness. For\r
this we use (Lemma 11.1) the existence of a smooth family τ : R\r
p → Aut(A) such\r
that x ◦ τ is a local diffeomorphism around χ. Thus given b ∈ A, to show that the\r
restriction of b to V is smooth, it is enough to show that τt(b) evaluated at χ is a\r
smooth function of t. This follows from the smoothness of the family τt. \u0003\r
Theorem 11.3. Let (A, H, D) be a strongly regular spectral triple fulfilling the\r
five conditions of §2 (cf. [11]) with c antisymmetric Then there exists an oriented\r
smooth compact manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
Proof. We let X = Spec(A) be the spectrum of A or equivalently of the norm\r
closure A. By construction it is a compact space. By Lemma 11.1, for every point\r
χ ∈ X there exists a neighborhood U of χ and p real elements x\r
µ ∈ A which give a\r
local homeomorphism φ of a neighborhood V of x with an open set in R\r
p\r
. Moreover\r
by Lemma 11.2 one has\r
f ∈ A|V ⇔ f ◦ φ\r
−1 ∈ C∞(Rp\r
)|φ(V )\r
This shows that on the intersection of such domains of local charts, the change\r
of chart is of class C∞. We can thus, using compactness, take a finite cover and\r
this endows X with a structure of p-dimensional smooth manifold. Lemma 11.2\r
shows that any a ∈ A restricts to a smooth function in each local chart and thus\r
A ⊂ C∞(X). Moreover given f ∈ C∞(X) there exists for each Vj in the finite open\r
51

cover of X an aj ∈ A with f|Vj = aj |Vj\r
. Then the existence of partitions of unity\r
(Lemma 2.10 of [22]):\r
ψj ∈ A ,\r
Xψj = 1 , Support ψj ⊂ Vj\r
shows that f agrees with Pψjaj ∈ A. We have shown that there exists a smooth\r
compact manifold X such that A = C∞(X). The cycle c gives a nowhere vanishing\r
section of the real exterior power ∧\r
p\r
(TX) and hence shows that the manifold X is\r
oriented. \u0003\r
We thus obtain the following characterization of the algebras C∞(X):\r
Theorem 11.4. An involutive algebra A is the algebra of smooth functions on an\r
oriented smooth compact manifold if and only if it admits a faithful 14 represen\u0002tation in a pair (H, D) fulfilling the five conditions of §2 (cf. [11]) with the cycle\r
antisymmetric and the strong regularity.\r
Proof. The direct implication follows from Theorem 11.3. Conversely, given an\r
oriented smooth compact manifold X of dimension p, one can take the represen\u0002tation in H = L\r
2\r
(X, ∧\r
∗\r
C\r
) the Hilbert space of square integrable differential forms\r
with complex coefficients, and use the choice of a Riemannian metric to get the\r
signature operator D = d + d\r
∗ with the Z/2-grading γ in the even case coming\r
from the Clifford multiplication by the volume form as in [18] Chapter 5. In the\r
odd case one uses the Clifford multiplication γ by the volume form to reduce the\r
Hilbert space H to the subspace given by γξ = ξ. More specifically we consider the\r
faithful representation of the Clifford algebra Cliff T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X) in ∧\r
∗T∗\r
x\r
(X) given by the\r
symbol of D, i.e.\r
(192) v. ξ = v ∧ ξ − iv ξ , ∀v ∈ T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X), ξ ∈ ∧∗T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X)\r
where iv is the contraction by v. This gives (cf. [18] Proposition 3.9) a canonical\r
isomorphism of vector spaces Cliff T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X) ∼ ∧∗T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X). We let ω be the section\r
of ∧\r
pT∗X given at each point by ω = e1 ∧ · · · ∧ ep where e1, . . . ep is any pos\u0002itively oriented orthonormal basis. In the Clifford algebra Cliff T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X) one has\r
ω\r
2 = (−1) p(p+1)\r
2 (cf. [18] (5.26)) and one defines\r
(193) γ ξ = i\r
−\r
p(p+1)\r
2 ω ξ , ∀ξ ∈ Cliff T\r
∗\r
x\r
(X) ⊗ C\r
where the product ω ξ is the left Clifford multiplication by ω. By [18] (5.35) this\r
left multiplication is related to the Hodge star operation by\r
(194) ω ξ = (−1)k(p−k)+ k(k+1)\r
2 ⋆ ξ , ∀ξ ∈ ∧k\r
.\r
With these notations one has d\r
∗ = (−1)(p+1)γdγ (cf. [18] (5.10)) which shows that\r
D commutes with γ when p is odd and anticommutes with γ when p is even.\r
To check the orientability condition 4), one uses (in both cases of the Dirac operator\r
or the signature operator) local coordinates x\r
µ and the equalities\r
(195) [D, f] = Xγ\r
µ\r
∂µf , {γ\r
µ\r
, γν} = −2g\r
µν\r
,\r
where the γ\r
µ correspond to the action of dxµ through the representation of the\r
Clifford algebra (given by (192) for the signature operator). One then has, for the\r
14i.e. with trivial kernel\r
52

multiple commutator,\r
(196) [γ\r
1\r
, γ2, . . ., γp] = p!i\r

γ\r
where √\r
g is the square root of the determinant of the matrix gµν and γ = γ\r
∗\r
,\r
γ\r
2 = 1 is the grading in the even case and is just 1 in the odd case15. Thus in these\r
local coordinates x\r
µ the cycle associated to the volume form:\r
c =\r
1\r
p!\r
X\r
σ\r
ǫ(σ)\r
√\r
g ⊗ x\r
σ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ xσ(p)\r
fulfills, locally, condition 4), up to the power of i, i\r
p(p+1)\r
2 . Using a partition of unity\r
gives the global form of c which is just the Hochschild cycle representing the global\r
volume form.\r
The condition of strong regularity is checked using §13. One applies Lemma 13.2 to\r
obtain the strong regularity since we take for D an elliptic differential operator of\r
order one on a smooth compact manifold and the principal symbol of D2is a scalar\r
multiple of the identity. This ensures that for any differential operator P of order\r
m the symbol of order m + 2 of [D2, P] vanishes as it is given by the commutator\r
of the principal symbols of order m and 2. Thus one gets that for any differential\r
operator T of order 0, the operators δ\r
m\r
1\r
(T ) are of the form P(1 + D2)\r
−m/2 where\r
P is a differential operator of order m. Thus the theory of elliptic operators (cf.\r
[15] Lemma 1.3.4 and 1.3.5) shows that they are bounded. This applies for D the\r
Dirac operator or the signature operator, thus one gets the strong regularity in this\r
case. \u0003\r
Theorem 11.5. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple with A commutative, fulfilling the\r
five conditions of §2 with the cycle c antisymmetric. Assume that the multiplicity16\r
of the action of A′′ in H is 2\r
p/2\r
. Then there exists a smooth oriented compact\r
(spinc) manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
Proof. We need to show that we can dispense with the hypothesis of strong regu\u0002larity in Theorem 11.3. Indeed by the first part of Remark 5.12, we get\r
(197) [([D, a][D, b] + [D, b][D, a]), [D, c]] = 0 , ∀a, b, c ∈ A\r
since this is implied by the commutation (78) of |[D, h]| with [D, c]. Thus if we work\r
at a point χ ∈ Spec(A) and let Sχ be the fiber at χ ∈ X of the finite projective\r
module H∞ and Mχ ⊂ EndSχ be the subalgebra generated by the [D, a] for a ∈ A,\r
it follows from (197) that\r
(198) [D, a][D, b] + [D, b][D, a] ∈ Z(Mχ), ∀a, b ∈ A\r
where Z(Mχ) is the center of Mχ. Let e be a minimal projection in the center of\r
Mχ. The equality πD(c) = γ shows that, at the point χ,\r
γe =\r
X\r
α\r
ea0\r
α[[D, a1α], [D, a2α], . . . , [D, apα]] 6= 0\r
so that the dimension of the space T\r
∗\r
e\r
(χ) = {e[D, a] | a ∈ A}χ is at least equal to\r
p. In fact, more precisely, for some α, the multiple commutator\r
[e[D, a1\r
α], e[D, a2α], . . ., e[D, apα]] = e[[D, a1α], [D, a2α], . . . , [D, apα]] 6= 0\r
15Since we reduced the Hilbert space H to the subspace given by γξ = ξ\r
16We restrict to the even case\r
53

which can hold only if the e[D, aj\r
α] are linearly independent. By (198) and the\r
minimality of e, the following equality defines a positive quadratic form Q on the\r
self-adjoint part of T\r
∗\r
e\r
(χ):\r
(199) Q(e[D, a])e = (e[D, a])2, ∀a ∈ A .\r
It is non-degenerate since when e[D, a] is self-adjoint, (e[D, a])2 = 0 implies e[D, a] =\r
0. Let then CQ be the Clifford algebra associated to the quadratic form Q on the\r
self-adjoint part of T\r
∗\r
e\r
(χ). The latter has real dimension ≥ p and the relations (198)\r
show that the map e[D, a] 7→ e[D, a] gives a representation of CQ in the complex\r
vector space eSχ. Thus this shows that the dimension of eSχ is then at least equal\r
to 2p/2. The hypothesis of the Theorem on the multiplicity of the action of A′′ in\r
H shows, using the condition of absolute continuity, that the fiber dimension of S\r
is 2p/2. This shows that e = 1 and also, since the complexification of the algebra\r
CQ is an N × N matrix algebra for N ≥ 2\r
p/2\r
, that Mχ = EndSχ for every χ ∈ X.\r
It also shows that the dimension of T\r
∗\r
(χ) is equal to p and that on Uα the [D, aj\r
α]\r
form a basis of T\r
∗\r
(χ). Consider then the following monomials\r
µF = [[D, aj1\r
α ], [D, aj2α ], . . . , [D, ajkα ]]\r
where F = {j1 < j2 < . . . < jk} is a subset with k elements of {1, 2, . . ., p}.\r
For every χ ∈ Uα the µF form a basis of Mχ = EndSχ. Thus any element T of\r
Mχ = EndSχ can be uniquely written in the form\r
(200) T =\r
XaF µF\r
The coefficients aF can be computed using the normalized trace on EndSχ, the\r
µF and the element T . Thus using the conditional expectation EA of (37) one\r
gets, for any endomorphism T of H∞ with support in Uα, that (200) holds with\r
coefficients aF ∈ A. This shows that any endomorphism T of H∞ is a polynomial\r
in the [D, a] with coefficients in A and it follows that it is automatically regular.\r
Thus the strong regularity holds and we can apply Theorem 11.3. To see that X is\r
a spinc manifold one uses [11] (see [14] for the detailed proof). \u0003\r
12. Final remarks\r
12.1. The role of D. By Lemma 2.1, the spectral triple (A, H, D) is entirely\r
determined by (A′′, H, D) where M = A′′ is the commutative von Neumann algebra\r
weak closure of A. It follows in particular that, except for the dimension N of\r
the bundle S which we may assume, for simplicity, to be constant and equal to\r
2\r
p/2\r
, there is no information in the pair (A′′, H): they are all pairwise isomorphic.\r
Similarly the only invariant of the pair (H, D) is the spectrum of D i.e. a list of real\r
numbers with multiplicity. By [20] this spectrum does not suffice to reconstruct the\r
geometry, and it is natural to wonder what additional invariant is required to do\r
so. As we shall briefly explain it is the relative position of M and of the self-adjoint\r
operator D which selects one geometric space, and it is worthwhile to look at the\r
conditions from this point of view. The analogue in our context of the geodesic\r
flow is the following one parameter group\r
(201) γt(T ) = e\r
it|D|Te−it|D|\r
, ∀T ∈ L(H).\r
54

We say17 that an operator T ∈ L(H) is of class C∞ when the map from R to L(H)\r
given by t 7→ γt(T ) is of class C∞ (for the norm topology of L(H)) and we denote\r
by C∞(H, D) this subalgebra of L(H). This algebra only depends upon (H, D) and\r
does not yet measure the compatibility of (M, H) and (H, D). This is measured by\r
the weak density in M of\r
(202) C\r
∞(M, H, D) = {T ∈ M ∩ C∞(H, D)|[D, T ] ∈ M′ ∩ C∞(H, D)}\r
where M′is the commutant of M. One checks that A = C∞(M, H, D) is a subal\u0002gebra of M and its size measures the compatibility of (M, H) and (H, D).\r
We now come to two equations which assert that A = C∞(M, H, D) is large enough,\r
so that we have maximal compatibility. One checks that H∞ = ∩DomDm is\r
automatically a module over A (for the obvious action). The first equation requires\r
that this module is finite and projective and that it admits a hermitian structure\r
( | ) (necessarily unique) such that:\r
(203) hξ, a ηi =\r
Z\r
− (ξ|η) a |ds|\r
p\r
, ∀a ∈ A, ∀ξ, η ∈ H∞\r
where R\r
− is the noncommutative integral given by the Dixmier trace.\r
The second equation means that we can find an element c of the tensor power A⊗n,\r
n = p + 1, totally antisymmetric in its last p-entries, and such that\r
(204) c(D) = 1 , where (a0 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ap)(D) = a0[D, a1] · · · [D, ap] , ∀aj ∈ A .\r
(This assumes p odd, in the even case one requires that for some c as above c(D) = γ\r
fulfills γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1, γD = −Dγ). We can now restate Theorem 11.5 as:\r
Theorem 12.1. Let (M, H, D) fulfill (202), (203) and (204), and N = 2p/2, then\r
there exists a unique smooth compact oriented spinc Riemannian manifold (X, g)\r
such that the triple (M, H, D) is given by\r
• M = L∞(X, dv) where dv is the Riemannian volume form.\r
• H = L\r
2\r
(X, S) where S is the spinor bundle.\r
• D is a Dirac operator associated to the Riemannian metric g.\r
Proof. We let A = C∞(M, H, D). By the weak density in M of (202), we know\r
that the multiplicity of the action of A′′ = M in H is N = 2p/2. By construction\r
the triple (A, H, D) fulfills the first three conditions . The fourth and fifth follow\r
from (203) and (204). Thus by Theorem 11.5 we get that A = C∞(X) for a smooth\r
oriented compact spinc manifold X. The conclusion then follows from [11] (see [14]\r
for the detailed proof). Note that there is no uniqueness of D since we only know\r
its principal symbol. This is discussed in [11] and [14]. \u0003\r
A striking feature of the above formulation is that the full information on the\r
geometric space is subdivided in two pieces\r
(1) The list of eigenvalues of D.\r
(2) The unitary relation F between the Hilbert space of the canonical pair\r
(M, H) and the Hilbert space of the canonical pair (H, D).\r
Of course the conceptual meaning of the unitary F is the Fourier transform, but\r
this second piece of data is now playing a role entirely similar to that of the CKM\r
matrix in the Standard Model [6]. Moreover, in the latter, the information about\r
the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs fields with the Fermions (quarks and leptons) is\r
17cf. Lemma 13.3 of §13\r
55

organised in a completely similar manner, namely 1) The masses of the particles\r
2) The CKM (and PMNS) matrix. At the conceptual level, such matrices describe\r
the relative position of two different bases in the same Hilbert space. They are\r
encoded by a double coset space closely related to Shimura varieties ([6]). These\r
points deserve further investigations and will be pursued in a forthcoming paper.\r
12.2. Finite propagation. One can use in the above context a result of Hilsum\r
[17] to obtain:\r
Lemma 12.2. The support of the kernel kt(x, y) of the operator e\r
itD is contained\r
in\r
{(x, y) ∈ X2| d(x, y) ≤ |t|}\r
where the distance d is defined as\r
d(x, y) = sup |h(x) − h(y)| , k[D, h]k ≤ 1\r
Proof. Let (x, y) ∈ X2 with d(x, y) > |t|. There exists h = h\r
∗\r
in A such that\r
k[D, h]k ≤ 1 and h(y) − h(x) > |t|. Also h and [D, h] commute by the order one\r
condition. Thus by Lemma 1.10 of [17], one has b < h(y), a > h(x) such that:\r
(h − b)+e\r
−itD(h − a)− = 0\r
so that kt(x, y) = 0. \u0003\r
12.3. Immersion versus embedding. The proof of Theorem 11.3 shows that,\r
with the cycle c given by (36), the map ψ from X to R\r
N given by the components\r
a\r
j\r
α for j ≥ 1 is an immersion. It is not however an embedding in general even\r

Let N be a neighborhood of the complement of B1 ∪ B2 in B. Let then a\r

12.4. The antisymmetry condition. We have used throughout the stronger\r
form of condition 4) where the Hochschild cycle c ∈ Hp(A, A) is assumed to be\r
totally antisymmetric in its last p-entries. It is unclear that one can relax the\r
antisymmetry condition on c. It is not true in general for commutative algebras\r
that any Hochschild class can be represented in this way, but this is the case for\r
A = C∞(X). In general, one has a natural projection on the antisymmetric chains,\r
given by the antisymmetrisation map P. It is defined by the equality\r
P(a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ap) = 1\r
p!\r
X\r
β\r
ǫ(β)a0 ⊗ aβ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ aβ(p)\r
Its range is contained in Zp(A, A) since A is commutative and any antisymmetric\r
chain is a cycle ([19] Proposition 1.3.5). It is not obvious that P maps Hochschild\r
boundaries to Hochschild boundaries. This follows from the equality\r
P =\r
1\r
p!\r
εp ◦ πp\r
where one lets Ωp\r
K = ∧\r
p\r
AΩ\r
1\r
K be the A-module of K¨ahler p-forms (cf. [19] 1.3.11)\r
and\r
(205) εp : Ωp\r
K → Hp(A, A), πp : Hp(A, A) → Ω\r
p\r
K\r
are defined in [19] Proposition 1.3.12 and Proposition 1.3.15. They are given by\r
(206) πk(a0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ak) = a0da1 ∧ · · · ∧ dak\r
and\r
(207) εk(a0da1 ∧ · · · ∧ dak) = Xǫ(σ)a0 ⊗ aσ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ aσ(k)\r
12.5. Strong regularity. The hypothesis of strong regularity is, in general, stronger\r
than regularity. Indeed the operation of direct sum (A, H1 ⊕ H2, D1 ⊕ D2) of two\r
spectral triples for the same algebra A preserves regularity but not, in general,\r
strong regularity.\r
Proposition 12.3. Assuming regularity the subalgebra ZD(A) of EndA(H∞) gen\u0002erated by A and the [D, b][D, c] + [D, c][D, b] for b, c ∈ A is a commutative algebra\r
containing A and commuting with [D, a] for all a ∈ A.\r
Proof. This follows from Remark 5.12 since (78) shows that [D, b]\r
2\r
commutes with\r
[D, a] for all a ∈ A. \u0003\r
The understanding of the general situation when one does not assume strong reg\u0002ularity should be an interesting problem since the inclusion A ⊂ ZD(A) should\r
correspond to a finite “ramified cover” of the corresponding spectra, with Y =\r
SpecZD(A) covering X = SpecA. It is easy to construct examples where Y has\r
singularities. It is not clear that, assuming the first five conditions, the space X is\r
always smooth. Similarly it is unclear what happens if one relaxes the regularity\r
condition to the Lipschitz regularity, since we made heavy use of at least C\r
1+ǫ\r
-\r
regularity in the above proofs. Finally it would be interesting also to investigate\r
the meaning of real analyticity of the space X in terms of the real analyticity of the\r
geodesic flow (201).\r
57

12.6. The Noncommutative case. Among the five conditions of §2 the condi\u0002tions 1), 3) and 5) make no use of the commutativity of the algebra A and they\r
extend as such to the noncommutative case. We refer to [11] for the extension\r
of conditions 2) and 4) to the noncommutative case. The extension of the order\r
one condition involves a new key ingredient which is an antilinear unitary operator\r
J in H which encodes the nuance between spin and spinc. It turns out to be an\r
incarnation not only of the charge conjugation in physics terms and of the needed\r
“real structure” to refine the K-theoretic meaning of the spectral triple from ordi\u0002nary K-homology to KO-homology but, at a deeper level, of the Tomita operator\r
which plays in the noncommutative case the role of a substitute for commutativity.\r
All this plays an important role in the noncommutative geometry understanding of\r
the standard model [6], [4], [5]. The extension of the “orientability” condition 4)\r
exists and it certainly holds e.g. for noncommutative tori ([11]) but it is not fully\r
satisfactory yet and its clarification should be considered as an open question.\r
13. Appendix 1: Regularity\r
The condition of regularity is not easy to check for smooth manifolds since it involves\r
the module of the operator D. We give below the equivalent formulation in terms\r
of D2(cf. [13]).\r
We deal with operators T which act on H∞ = ∩DomDn. We say that T is bounded\r
when\r
(208) kT k = sup{kTξk | ξ ∈ H∞ , kξk ≤ 1}\r
is finite. We still denote by T the unique continuous extension to a bounded\r
operator in H. By self-adjointness of D the domain H∞ is a core for powers of\r
D or of |D|. The derivation δ(T ) = [|D|, T ] is defined algebraically as an operator\r
in H∞. The relation with the commutator in H is given as follows.\r
Lemma 13.1. Assume that both T and [|D|, T ] are bounded (as in (208)). Then\r
T preserves Dom|D| = DomD and the bounded extension of [|D|, T ] coincides with\r
the commutator |D|T − T |D| on Dom|D|.\r
Proof. Let ξ ∈ Dom|D|. There exists a sequence ξn ∈ H∞ with ξn → ξ and\r
|D|ξn → |D|ξ. Since T is bounded the sequences Tξn and T |D|ξn are convergent\r
and converge to Tξ and T |D|ξ. Since [|D|, T ] is bounded the sequence (|D|T −\r
T |D|)ξn converges. Thus |D|Tξn converges, and as |D| is closed one gets that Tξ\r
is in the domain of |D|. Thus Dom|D| is invariant under T . Moreover one has\r
|D|Tξ = (|D|T − T |D|)ξ + T |D|ξ. \u0003\r
In other words, saying that both T and [|D|, T ] are bounded is equivalent, for\r
operators acting in H∞ to T ∈ Domδ and moreover δ(T ) is then the bounded\r
extension of |D|T − T |D|.\r
We introduce the following variant of δ, defined on operators T acting in H∞,\r
(209) δ1(T ) = [D2, T ](1 + D2)\r
−1/2\r
Lemma 13.2. Let T acting in H∞ be bounded.\r
(1) If δ1(T ) and δ\r
2\r
1\r
(T ) are bounded so is δ(T ).\r
(2) The δ\r
n\r
1\r
(T ) are bounded for all n iff so are the δ\r
n(T ).\r
58

Proof. (1) The module |D| is given by the following integral, which makes sense\r
when applied to any ξ ∈ DomD, which we omit for simplicity\r
(210) |D| =\r
2\r
π\r
Z ∞\r
0\r
D2\r
D2 + u\r
2\r

To avoid dealing with the kernel of D we use the decomposition δ = δ\r
′ + δ0 where\r
the derivations δ\r
′ and δ0 commute, and δ0 is bounded,\r
(211) δ\r
′\r
(T ) = [Q, T ] , Q = D\r

2\r

, ∀x ∈ R\r
One has f ∈ C0(R) and the derivation δ0 is bounded, in fact kδ0k ≤ 1 since\r
kf0k∞ < 1/2. One has\r
(213) Q =\r

2\r
Thus using\r
[\r

D2 + 1 + u\r
2\r
, [D2, T ]] = −\r
1\r
D2 + 1 + u\r
2\r
[D2, [D2, T ]] 1\r

2\r
we get\r

(D2 + 1 + u\r

Thus combining with (214) one gets\r
(215) δ\r

(T ) = 1\r

Now one has [D2, [D2, T ]] = δ\r
2\r

(T )(1 + D2) and\r
k\r
(1 + u\r
2\r

(D2 + 1 + u\r

k ≤ 1\r
so that\r

and one gets\r
(216) kδ\r
′\r
(T )k ≤ kδ1(T )k + kδ\r
2\r
1\r
(T )k .\r
Now if both δ1(T ) and δ\r
2\r
1\r
(T ) are bounded, we get that δ\r
′\r
(T ) is bounded and since\r
δ = δ\r
′ + δ0 with δ0 bounded, we get that δ(T ) is bounded, with\r
(217) kδ(T )k ≤ X\r
2\r
0\r
kδ\r
j\r
1\r
(T )k .\r
(2) The operations δ and δ1 commute since |D| commutes with D2. Let us assume\r
that the δ\r
n\r
1\r
(T ) are bounded. We have seen that δ(T ) is bounded. To show that\r
δ\r
2\r
(T ) is bounded it is enough to show that δ\r
m\r
1\r
(δ(T )) are bounded for m = 1, 2.\r
But δ\r
m\r
1\r
(δ(T )) = δ(δ\r
m\r
1\r
(T )) which is bounded since the δ\r
n\r
1\r
(δ\r
m\r
1\r
(T )) are bounded for\r
n ≤ 2, m ≤ 2. More generally let us show by induction on n an inequality of the\r
form\r
(218) kδ\r
n\r
(T )k ≤ X\r
2n\r
0\r
cn,kkδ\r
k\r
1\r
(T )k\r
To get it for n + 1, assuming it for n, one uses (217) which gives\r
kδ(δ\r
n\r
(T ))k ≤ X\r
2\r
0\r
kδ\r
j\r
1\r
(δ\r
n\r

X\r
2n\r
0\r

k\r
1\r
(δ\r

1\r
(T ))k\r
Thus we obtain by induction that δ\r
n\r
(T ) is bounded.\r
Conversely, the boundedness of the δ\r
n(T ) implies that of the δn\r
1\r
(T ). Indeed the\r
boundedness of the δ\r
n(T ) is equivalent to the boundedness of the δ′′n\r
(T ) where\r
δ\r
′′(T ) = [(1 + D2\r
)\r
1/2\r
, T ] since |D| − (1 + D2)\r
1/2\r
is bounded and commutes with\r
|D|. Moreover the square of the operation\r
T 7→ (1 + D2)\r
1/2T (1 + D2\r
)\r
−1/2 = T + δ′′(T )(1 + D2\r
)\r
−1/2\r
is\r
T 7→ (1 + D2)T (1 + D2)\r
−1 = T + [D2\r
, T ](1 + D2)\r
−1\r
which gives\r
[D\r
2\r
, T ](1 + D\r
2\r
)\r
−1 = 2δ′′(T )(1 + D2\r
)\r
−1/2 + δ′′2\r
(T )(1 + D\r
2\r
)\r
−1\r
so that\r
δ1(T ) = 2δ\r
′′(T ) + δ′′2\r
(T )(1 + D\r
2\r
)\r
−1/2\r
and one can proceed as above to get the boundedness of the δ\r
n\r
1\r
(T ). \u0003\r
Finally we relate the regularity condition with the smoothness of the geodesic flow\r
t → γt(T ) = e\r
it|D|Te−it|D| of (49).\r
Lemma 13.3. Let T ∈ L(H), then the following conditions are equivalent:\r
(1) T ∈ ∩mDom δ\r
m.\r
(2) t → γt(T ) is of class C∞ in the norm topology.\r
60

Proof. Let us show that (1) ⇒ (2). By (10) T preserves H∞. We write the Taylor\r
formula with remainder\r
(219) f(t) = f(0) + tf′(0) + . . . +\r

function is of class C∞. One gets\r

since f\r

(k)\r
(T ))ξ by induction on k. This shows that t → γt(T ) is of\r
class C∞ in the norm topology, since the norm of the remainder is O(t\r
n+1). Let\r
us show the converse (2) ⇒ (1). It is enough to show that if T ∈ L(H)) and the\r
following limit exists in norm limt→0\r
1\r
t\r
(γt(T ) − T ), then T ∈ Domδ and the limit\r
is iδ(T ). One has, for ξ ∈ H,\r
(221) ξ ∈ Dom|D| ⇔ ∃ limt→0\r
1\r
t\r
(e\r

where the limit is supposed to exist in norm. Assuming that for some bounded\r
operator Y ∈ L(H) one has limt→0 k\r
1\r
t\r
(γt(T ) − T ) − Y k = 0, one gets for any\r
ξ ∈ Dom|D|, that 1\r
t\r
(e\r
it|D|Tξ − Tξ) → iT |D|ξ + Y ξ. This shows that Tξ ∈ Dom|D|\r
and that i|D|Tξ = iT |D|ξ + Y ξ which gives the required equality. \u0003\r
14. Appendix 2: The Dixmier trace and the heat expansion\r
We first recall the basic properties of the Dixmier trace. Recall that the character\u0002istic value µn(T ) of a compact operator T is the n-th eigenvalue of |T | arranged in\r
decreasing order and is equal to\r
(222) inf{kT |E⊥k | dim E = n − 1}\r
Definition 14.1. We define the Weyl norms by\r
(223) σN (T ) = X\r
N\r
1\r
µn(T )\r
The fact that they are norms and in particular fulfill\r
(224) σN (T1 + T2) ≤ σN (T1) + σN (T1)\r
follows from the next statement in which we use the same notation for a subspace\r
E ⊂ H and the orthogonal projection on that subspace.\r
Proposition 14.2. One has\r
(225) σN (T ) = sup{kTEk1 | dim E = N}\r
Let T be a positive operator, then\r
(226) σN (T ) = sup{Tr(TE)| dim E = N}\r
We use the following notation for refined limiting processes,\r
61

Definition 14.3. With the Ces`aro mean M defined by\r
(227) M(f)(λ) = 1\r
log λ\r
Z λ\r
1\r
f(u)\r
du\r
u\r
.\r
and h(λ) a bounded function of λ > 0, ω a linear form on Cb(R\r
∗\r
+) which is positive,\r
ω(1) = 1, and vanishes on C0(R\r
∗\r
+), and φ an homeomorphism of R\r
∗\r
+, we define:\r
(228) Limk\r
φ(λ)→ωh(λ) = ω(Mk\r
(g)), g(λ) = h(φ\r
−1\r
(λ))\r
where the upper index k indicates that we iterate the Ces`aro mean k-times.\r
We write Limω as an abbreviation for Lim1\r
ω\r
, and when we apply it to a sequence\r
(αN )N∈N we mean that the sequence has been extended to a function using\r
(229) fα(λ) = αN for λ ∈ ]N − 1, N].\r
Also we consider the two-sided ideal containing compact operators of order one,\r
(230) L\r
(1,∞)\r
(H) = {T ∈ K; σN (T ) = O(log N)} .\r
Definition 14.4. For T ≥ 0, T ∈ L(1,∞)(H), we set\r
(231) Trω(T ) = Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
X\r
N\r
n=1\r
µn(T ).\r
The basic properties of the Dixmier trace Trω are summarized in the following ([9]\r
Proposition 3, IV.2.β):\r
Proposition 14.5. Trω extends uniquely by linearity to the entire ideal L\r
(1,∞)\r
(H)\r
and has the following properties:\r
(a) If T ≥ 0 then Trω(T ) ≥ 0.\r
(b) If S is any bounded operator and T ∈ L(1,∞)(H), then Trω(ST ) = Trω(TS).\r
(c) Trω(T ) is independent of the choice of the inner product on H, i.e. it de\u0002pends only on the Hilbert space H as a topological vector space.\r
(d) Trω vanishes on the ideal L\r
(1,∞)\r
0\r
(H), which is the closure, for the k k1,∞-\r
norm, of the ideal of finite-rank operators.\r
We fix p ∈ [1, ∞]. Let D be a self-adjoint unbounded operator such that its re\u0002solvent is an infinitesimal of order 1/p, i.e. such18 that µn(D−1\r
) = O(n\r
−1/p). We\r
shall compare Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
) and lim ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫD)T ). We let EN be the spectral\r
projection19 on the first N-eigenvectors of |D| so that dimEN = N, EN < EN+1\r
and\r
(232) Tr(EN |D|\r
−p\r
) = σN (|D|\r
−p\r
).\r
Lemma 14.6. For any bounded operator T ∈ L(H) one has\r
(233) Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT ) = Trω(T |D|−p\r
)\r
18We replace D by a non-zero constant on its kernel so that D−1 makes sense.\r
19This is ambiguous when there is spectral multiplicity.\r
62

Proof. The hypothesis on D shows that Tr(EN |D|\r
−p\r
) = O(log N). Moreover, by\r
construction of the Dixmier trace, one has\r
(234) Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
Tr(EN |D|\r
−p\r
) = Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
σN (|D|\r
−p\r
) = Trω(|D|\r
−p\r
)\r
Let φ(T ) be the left-hand side of (233). It makes sense since\r
|Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT )| ≤ Tr(EN |D|−p\r
)kT k = O(log N)\r
so that the sequence 1\r
log N Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT ) is bounded. The functional φ on L(H) is\r
linear and positive (the trace of the product of the two positive operators EN |D|\r
−p\r
and T is positive). Let ψ(T ) be the right-hand side of (233). Proposition 14.5 shows\r
that, since |D|\r
−p ∈ L(1,∞)\r
(H), the functional ψ is a positive linear functional on\r
L(H). One uses Proposition 14.5, (b) to check the positivity, using for T ≥ 0,\r
Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
) = Trω(T\r
1/2\r
|D|\r
−pT1/2\r
) ≥ 0 .\r
Let us show that for any T ≥ 0 one has φ(T ) ≤ ψ(T ). One has\r
σN (T\r
1/2\r
|D|\r
−pT1/2\r
) = σN (|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2\r
)\r
using A = |D|\r
−p/2T1/2\r
in\r
(235) µn(A\r
∗A) = µn(AA∗\r
), ∀A ∈ K , n ∈ N .\r
Thus one gets\r
(236) ψ(T ) = Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
) = Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
σN (|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2\r
)\r
By (226), one has\r
σN (|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2\r
) = sup{Tr(|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2E)| dim E = N}\r
≥ Tr(|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2EN ) = Tr(EN |D|−pT )\r
since EN and |D|\r
−p/2\r
commute. Thus σN (|D|\r
−p/2T |D|−p/2\r
) ≥ Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT ) and\r
after dividing by log N and applying Limω to both sides one gets the inequality\r
φ(T ) ≤ ψ(T ). But, by (234), φ(1) = Trω(|D|\r
−p\r
) = ψ(1) and thus the positive\r
functional θ = ψ−φ is equal to 0, by the Schwartz inequality |θ(T )|\r
2 ≤ θ(T∗T )θ(1).\r
\u0003\r
With |D| as above, we let as in (156), for any λ > 0,\r
(237) P(λ) = 1[0,λ](|D|), α(λ) = TrP(λ).\r
Lemma 14.7. Assume that\r
(238) lim inf λ\r
−pα(λ) > 0\r
Then, for any bounded operator T ∈ L(H) one has\r
(239) p Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT ) = Limλp→ω\r
1\r
log λ\r
Tr(P(λ)|D|\r
−pT )\r
Proof. We can assume by linearity that T ≥ 0. We have (using (157)) constants\r
c1 > 0 and c2 < ∞ such that:\r
(240) c1λ\r
p ≤ α(λ) ≤ c2λp\r
We let:\r
(241) f(N) = Tr(EN |D|\r
−pT ), g(λ) = Tr(P(λ)|D|−pT )\r
63

Since dimP(λ) ≤ N implies P(λ) ≤ EN we get, using P(λ)|D|\r
−p ≤ EN |D|−p\r
,\r
(242) f(N) ≥ g(λ), ∀λ, c2λ\r
p ≤ N .\r
Similarly, since dimP(λ) ≥ N implies P(λ) ≥ EN we get\r
(243) f(N) ≤ g(λ), ∀λ, c1λ\r
p ≥ N .\r
We extend f(N) to positive real values of N as a non-decreasing step function.\r
The arbitrariness of the extension is irrelevant since f(N + 1) − f(N) → 0 when\r
N → ∞ and we are interested in Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
f(N) which is insensitive to bounded\r
perturbations of f. By construction, the Ces`aro mean satisfies the following scale\r
invariance, for bounded functions f,\r
(244) |M(θµ(f))(λ) − M(f)(λ)| → 0 as λ → ∞,\r
where µ > 0 and θµ(f)(λ) = f(µ\r
−1λ) ∀λ ∈ R∗\r
+. It follows from (242) and (243)\r
that f(c1N) ≤ g(N1/p) ≤ f(c2N) up to o(N) and for any positive real N. Thus the\r
scale invariance of the Ces`aro mean (244), together with log N/ log cN → 1 gives:\r
(245) M(\r
1\r
log N\r
f(N)) − M(\r
1\r
log N\r
g(N\r
1/p)) → 0\r
so that\r
Limω\r
1\r
log N\r
f(N) = 1\r
p\r
Limω\r
1\r
log N1/p g(N\r
1/p)\r
and the required equality (239) follows from Definition 14.3. \u0003\r
Corollary 14.8. Assuming (238), one has\r
(246) p Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
) = Limλp→ω\r
1\r
log λ\r
Tr(P(λ)|D|\r
−pT ), ∀T ∈ L(H).\r
Proof. This follows from Lemmas 14.6 and 14.7. \u0003\r
Theorem 14.9. Assume (238). Let f ∈ Cc([0, ∞[). Let ρ = p\r
R ∞\r
0\r
u\r
p−1f(u)du.\r
Then for any bounded operator T ∈ L(H) one has\r
(247) Lim2\r
ǫ−p→ω\r
ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ) = ρ Trω(T |D|−p\r
)\r
Proof. Let g(u) = u\r
p\r
f(u) viewed as an integrable function on the multiplicative\r
group R\r
∗\r
+, endowed with its normalized Haar measure d\r
∗u =\r
du\r
u\r
. We can assume\r
that T ≥ 0. We consider the positive measure on R\r
∗\r
+ given by dβ(λ) where\r
(248) β(λ) = Tr(P(λ)|D|\r
−pT )\r
which is a non-decreasing step function of λ. The measure dβ is a positive linear\r
combination of Dirac masses, dβ =\r
Pαnδλn\r
. One has\r
dβ(λ) = Tr(dP(λ)|D|\r
−pT ) = λ−pTr(dP(λ)T )\r
ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ) = ǫp\r
Z\r
f(ǫλ)Tr(dP(λ)T ) = Zǫ\r
pλp\r
f(ǫλ)dβ(λ)\r
so that:\r
(249) ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ) = Z\r
g(ǫλ)dβ(λ)\r
64

The convolution of the measure dβ with the function ˜g(u) = g(u\r
−1\r
) makes sense,\r
since both have support in an interval [u0, ∞[ with u0 > 0, and gives the function\r
(250) (˜g ⋆ dβ)(u) = Zg(u\r
−1λ)dβ(λ).\r
Thus, with h(ǫ) = ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ), one gets using (249),\r
(251) h(u\r
−1\r
) = (˜g ⋆ dβ)(u)\r
The convolution of the measures ˜g(u)d\r
∗u and dβ is absolutely continuous with\r
respect to d\r
∗u and is given, with θu(v) = uv for all u, v > 0, by\r
(252) (˜g ⋆ dβ)d\r
∗u =\r
Z\r
g˜(u)θu(dβ)d\r
∗u .\r
We extend the definition of the Ces`aro mean (227) to measures µ by:\r
(253) M(µ)(λ) = 1\r
log λ\r
Z λ\r
1\r
dµ ,\r
so that\r
(254) M(µ)(λ) = M(h)(λ) for µ = h d∗u .\r
One has β(λ) = O(log λ) since\r
β(λ) ≤ Tr(P(λ)|D|\r
−p\r
)kT k ≤ Z λ\r
0\r
u\r
−p\r
dα(u)kT k\r
while α(u) = 0 near 0, and u\r
−pα(u) is bounded by (240). This gives after integrat\u0002ing by parts\r
Z λ\r
0\r
u\r
−p\r
dα(u) = λ\r
−pα(λ) + Z λ\r
0\r
p u−p−1α(u)du ≤ c2(1 + p log λ) + c\r
′\r
Moreover for v > 1 one gets, by the above integration by parts,\r
(255) β(vλ) − β(λ) ≤ kT k\r
Z vλ\r
λ\r
u\r
−p\r
dα(u) ≤ kT k c2(1 + log v).\r
One has\r
(256) M(dβ)(λ) = 1\r
log λ\r
Z λ\r
1\r
dβ =\r
1\r
log λ\r
(β(λ) − β(1))\r
Thus one has constants a and b such that for any u,\r
(257) |M(θu(dβ))(λ) − M(dβ)(λ)| =≤ (a + b| log u|)(log λ)\r
−1\r
Thus since ˜g(u) and | log u|g˜(u) are integrable,\r
(258) M(\r
Z\r
g˜(u)θu(dβ)d\r
∗u) − M(dβ)\r
Z\r
g˜(u)d\r
∗u → 0\r
Equivalently, using (251), (252), (254) and Rg˜(u)d\r
∗u =\r
R\r
g(u)d\r
∗u,\r
(259) M(h˜) − M(dβ)\r
Z\r
g(u)d\r
∗u → 0 , h˜(u) = h(u−1\r
).\r
Now by (256) and (246) one has\r
(260) Limλp→ωM(dβ)(λ) = p Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
)\r
65

Thus we finally get\r
(261) (p\r
Z\r
g(u)d\r
∗u)Trω(T |D|−p\r
) = Limλp→ωM(h˜)(λ)\r
The right hand side is given, by definition, by\r
Limλp→ωM(h˜)(λ) = ω(M(k)(u)), k(u) = M(h˜)(u\r
1/p)\r
Thus we still need to compare k(u) = M(h˜)(u\r
1/p) with k1(u) = M(h˜(λ1/p))(u),\r
but a simple computation shows that k(u) = k1(u). \u0003\r
Corollary 14.10. Assume (238). Let f ∈ Cc([0, ∞[)+ be a positive function. Let\r
ρ = p\r
R ∞\r
0\r
u\r
p−1f(u)du. One has, when ǫ → 0,\r
(262) lim inf ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ) ≤ ρ Trω(T |D|−p\r
).\r
Proof. Let δ = lim inf ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ). Then for any c < 1 one has h(ǫ) =\r
ǫ\r
p Tr(f(ǫ|D|)T ) ≥ cδ for ǫ ≤ ǫc > 0. It follows that Lim2\r
ǫ−p→ωh(ǫ) ≥ cδ. Thus\r
by (247) one has cδ ≤ ρ Trω(T |D|\r
−p\r
) and one gets (262). \u0003\r

ALAIN CONNES\r
Abstract. We show that the first five of the axioms we had formulated on\r
spectral triples suffice (in a slightly stronger form) to characterize the spectral\r
triples associated to smooth compact manifolds. The algebra, which is assumed\r
to be commutative, is shown to be isomorphic to the algebra of all smooth\r
functions on a unique smooth oriented compact manifold, while the operator\r
is shown to be of Dirac type and the metric to be Riemannian.\r

The problem of spectral characterization of manifolds was initially formulated as\r
an open question in [11]. The issue is to show that under the simple conditions\r
of [11] on a spectral triple (A, H, D), with A commutative, the algebra A is the\r
algebra C∞(X) of smooth functions on a (unique) smooth compact manifold X.\r
The five conditions ([11]), in dimension p, are\r
(1) The n-th characteristic value of the resolvent of D is O(n\r
−1/p).\r
(2) [[D, a], b] = 0 ∀ a, b ∈ A.\r
(3) For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for any integer\r
m where δ is the derivation: δ(T ) = [|D|, T ].\r
(4) There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zp(A, A) such that πD(c) = 1 for p\r
odd, while for p even, πD(c) = γ is a Z/2 grading.\r
(5) Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ = ∩DomDm is finite and projective.\r
Moreover the following equality defines a hermitian structure ( | ) on this\r
module: hξ, a ηi =\r
R\r
− a(ξ|η)|D|\r
−p\r
, ∀a ∈ A, ∀ξ, η ∈ H∞.\r
The notations are recalled at the beginning of §2 below. The strategy of proof was\r
outlined briefly in [11]. It consists in using the components a\r
j\r
α (j > 0) of the cycle\r
c =\r
Pa\r
0\r
α ⊗a\r
1\r
α ⊗· · ·⊗a\r
p\r
α as tentative local charts. There are three basic difficulties:\r
a) Show that the spectrum X of A is large enough so that the range of “local\r
charts” aα contains an open set in R\r
p\r
.\r
b) Show that the joint spectral measure of the components a\r
j\r
α (j > 0) of a\r
“local chart” is the Lebesgue measure.\r
c) Apply the basic inequality ([8], [9], Proposition IV.3.14) giving an upper\r
bound on the Voiculescu obstruction [25] and use [25] Theorem 4.5 to show\r
that the “local charts” are locally injective.\r
In a recent paper [22], Rennie and Varilly considered the above challenging problem.\r
The paper [22] is a courageous attempt which contains a number of interesting\r
ideas and a useful smooth calculus but also, unfortunately, several gaps, each being\r
enough to invalidate the proof of the claimed result.\r
I will show in this paper how to prove a), b), c). I have tried to be very careful\r
and give detailed proofs. The way to prove a) uses a new ingredient: the implicit\r
function theorem (whose presence is not a real surprise). We shall first assume that\r
continuous ∗-derivations of A exponentiate, i.e. are generators of one-parameter\r
groups (of automorphisms of A). Then most of the work, done in §§5, 6, is to show\r
that this hypothesis can be removed. In this very technical part of the paper we\r
show that enough self-adjoint derivations of A exponentiate. We first prove in §5\r
that enough derivations are dissipative for the C\r
∗\r
-algebra norm. We then proceed\r
in §6 and use the self-adjointness of D and the third condition (regularity) in the\r
strong form, to show the surjectivity of the resolvent, and apply the Hille-Yosida\r
Theorem to integrate these derivations into one-parameter groups of automorphisms\r
of the C\r
∗\r
-algebra. We then show that they are continuous for the Sobolev norms\r
and define automorphisms of A.\r
To prove b) one needs a key result which is the analogue in our context of the quasi\u0002invariance under diffeomorphisms of the smooth measure class on a manifold, whose\r
replacement in our case is given by the Dixmier trace. This is shown in Proposition\r
6.16 at the end of §6. We then prove in §7 the required absolute continuity of the\r
2

spectral measure using a smearing argument. In §8 we show the required inequality\r
between the multiplicity of the map sα and the spectral multiplicity of the a\r
j\r
α.\r
To prove c) a new strategy is required. Roughly one needs to know that the multi\u0002plicity function of a tentative local coordinate system is locally bounded while the\r
information one obtains just by applying the strategy outlined in [11] (and pursued\r
in [22]) is that it is a lower semicontinuous1integrable function. Typical examples\r
of Lebesgue negligible dense Gδ sets2show that, as such, the situation is hopeless.\r
In order to solve this problem, one needs a local form of the basic inequality ([8],\r
[9], Proposition IV.3.14) giving an upper bound on the Voiculescu obstruction. We\r
prove this result in §9. This key result is combined with Voiculescu’s Theorem\r
(Theorem 4.5 of [25]) and with the initial implicit function technique to conclude\r
the proof in §11. Our main result can be stated as follows (cf. Theorem 11.3):\r
Theorem 1.1. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple, with A commutative, fulfilling\r
the first five conditions of [11] (cf. §2) in a slightly stronger form i.e. we assume\r
that:\r
• The regularity holds for all A-endomorphisms of ∩DomDm.\r
• The Hochschild cycle c is antisymmetric.\r
Then there exists a compact oriented smooth manifold X such that A is the algebra\r
C∞(X) of smooth functions on X.\r
Moreover every compact oriented smooth manifold appears in this spectral manner.\r
Our next result is the following variant (Theorem 11.5):\r
Theorem 1.2. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple with A commutative, fulfilling the\r
first five conditions of [11] (cf. §2) with the cycle c antisymmetric. Assume that the\r
multiplicity of the action of A′′ in H is 2\r
p/2\r
. Then there exists a smooth oriented\r
compact (spinc) manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
This multiplicity hypothesis is a weak form of the Poincar´e duality condition 6 of\r
[11] and thus the above theorem can be seen as the solution of the original problem\r
formulated in [11] and gives a characterization of spinc manifolds. It follows from\r
[11] (cf. [14] for the proof) that the operator D is then a Dirac operator. The reality\r
condition selects spin manifolds among spinc, and the spectral action ([3]) selects\r
the Levi-Civita connection.\r
Finally we make a few remarks in §12. The first describes a different perspective on\r
our main result. As explained many times, it is only because one drops commuta\u0002tivity that variables with continuous range can coexist with infinitesimal variables\r
(which only affect finitely many values larger than a given ǫ). In the classical\r
formulation of variables, as maps from a set X to the real numbers, infinitesimal\r
variables cannot coexist with continuous variables. The formalism of quantum\r
mechanics and the uniqueness of the separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space\r
cure this problem. Using this formalism, variables with continuous range (i.e. self\u0002adjoint operators with continuous spectrum) coexist, in the same operator theoretic\r
framework, with variables with countable range, such as the infinitesimal ones (i.e.\r
compact operators). The only new fact is that they do not commute. The content\r
of Theorem 1.2 can be expressed in a suggestive manner from this coexistence be\u0002tween the continuum and the discrete. We fix the integer p and N = 2[p/2] where\r
1\r
the inverse image of ]a,∞] is open\r
2\r
countable intersection of open sets\r
3

[p/2] is the integral part of p/2. The continuum will only be used through its “mea\u0002sure theoretic” content. This is captured by a commutative von-Neumann algebra\r
M and, provided there is no atomic part in M, this algebra is then unique (up to\r
isomorphism). It is uniquely represented in Hilbert space H (which we fix once and\r
for all, as a universal stage) once the spectral multiplicity is fixed equal to N. Thus\r
the pair (M, H) is unique (up to isomorphism). Let us now consider (separately\r
first) an infinitesimal ds i.e. a self-adjoint compact operator in H. Equivalently\r
we can talk about its inverse D which is unbounded and self-adjoint. We assume\r
that ds is an infinitesimal of finite order α =\r
1\r
p\r
. The information contained in the\r
operator ds is entirely captured by a list of real numbers, namely the eigenvalues\r
of ds (with their multiplicity). This list determines uniquely (up to isomorphism)\r
the pair (H, D). Theorem 1.2 can now be restated as the birth of a geometry\r
from the coexistence of (M, H) with (H, D). This coexistence is encoded by a uni\u0002tary isomorphism F between the Hilbert space of the canonical pair (M, H) and\r
the Hilbert space of the canonical pair (H, D). Thus the full information on the\r
geometric space is subdivided in two pieces\r
(1) The list of eigenvalues of D.\r
(2) The unitary F.\r
We point out in §12 the analogy between these parameters for geometry and the\r
parameters of the Yukawa coupling of the Standard Model ([6]) which are encoded\r
similarly by:\r
(1) The list of masses.\r
(2) The CKM matrix C.\r
This analogy as well as the precise definition of the corresponding unitary invariant\r
of Riemannian geometry will be dealt with in details in the companion paper [12].\r
The second remark recalls a result of M. Hilsum on finite propagation (cf. [17]).\r
We then discuss briefly in §12 the variations dealing with real analytic manifolds,\r
non-integral dimensions and the non-commutative case.\r
We end with two appendices. In the first, §13, we discuss equivalent formulations\r
of the regularity condition. In the second, §14, we recall the basic properties of the\r
Dixmier trace and its relation with the heat expansion.\r

Let us recall the conditions for commutative geometry as formulated in [11]. We\r
shall only use the first five conditions.\r
We let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple, thus H is a Hilbert space, A an involutive\r
algebra represented in H and D is a selfadjoint operator in H. We assume that\r
A is commutative. We are given an integer p which controls the dimension of our\r
space. The conditions are:\r
1) Dimension: The n-th characteristic value of the resolvent of D is O(n\r
−1/p).\r
2) Order one: [[D, f], g] = 0 ∀ f, g ∈ A.\r
We let δ(T ) = [|D|, T ] be the commutator3 with the absolute value of D:\r
3The domain of δ is the set of bounded operators T with T Dom|D| ⊂ Dom|D| and δ(T)\r
bounded.\r
4

3) Regularity: For any a ∈ A both a and [D, a] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m.\r
We let πD be the linear map given by\r
(1) πD(a\r
0 ⊗ a1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ap\r
) = a\r
0\r
[D, a1] . . . [D, ap] , ∀a\r
j ∈ A .\r
4) Orientability: There exists a Hochschild cycle c ∈ Zp(A, A) such that πD(c) = 1\r
for p odd, while for p even, πD(c) = γ satisfies\r
γ = γ\r
∗\r
, γ2 = 1 , γD = −Dγ .\r
5) Finiteness and absolute continuity:Viewed as an A-module the space H∞ =\r
∩m Domain Dm is finite and projective. Moreover the following equality defines a\r
hermitian structure ( | ) on this module,\r
(2) hξ, a ηi =\r
Z\r
− a(ξ|η)|D|\r
−p ∀ a ∈ A , ∀ ξ, η ∈ H∞ .\r
In other words the module can be written as H∞ = eAn with e = e\r
∗ ∈ Mn(A)\r
defining the Hermitian structure so that\r
(3) (ξ|η) = Xξ\r
∗\r
i\r
ηi ∈ A , ∀ξ, η ∈ eA\r
n\r
It follows from condition 4) and from4([9], Theorem 8, IV.2.γ, and [14]) that the\r
operators a |D|\r
−p\r
, a ∈ A are measurable ([9], Definition 7, IV.2.β) so that the\r
coefficient R− a |D|\r
−p of the logarithmic divergence of their trace is unambiguously\r
defined.\r
It follows from condition 5) that the algebra A is uniquely determined inside its\r
weak closure A′′ (which is also the bicommutant of A in H) by the equality\r
A = {T ∈ A′′ ; T ∈ ∩m>0 Domδ\r
m} .\r
This was stated without proof in [11] and we give the argument below:\r
Lemma 2.1. The following conditions are equivalent for T ∈ A′′:\r
(1) T ∈ A\r
(2) [D, T ] is bounded and both T and [D, T ] belong to the domain of δ\r
m, for\r
any integer m\r
(3) T belongs to the domain of δ\r
m, for any integer m\r
(4) T H∞ ⊂ H∞\r
Proof. Let us assume the fourth property. Then T defines an endomorphism of\r
the finite projective module H∞ = eAn over A. As any endomorphism T is of the\r
form,\r
(4) T = e[aij ]e , aij ∈ A\r
i.e. it is the compression of a matrix a = [aij ] ∈ Mn(A).\r
Let us show that since T belongs to the weak closure of A one can choose aij = xδij\r
for some element x of A. The norm closure A of A in L(H) is a commutative C\r
∗\r
-\r
algebra, A = C(X) for some compact space X, and since A is a subalgebra of L(H)\r
it injects in A. The following equality\r
(5) λ(f) = Z−f|D|\r
−p\r
, ∀f ∈ A,\r
4We shall not use this result in an essential manner since one can just fix a choice of Dixmier\r
trace Trω throughout the proof.\r
5

defines a positive measure λ on X. We let E = eAn be the induced finite projective\r
module over A, which is intrinsically defined as E = H∞ ⊗A A. We let S be the\r
hermitian vector bundle on X such that E = C(X, S). By the absolute continuity\r
relation (2), the representation of A = C(X) in H is obtained from its action in\r
L\r
2\r
(X, λ) by the tensor product\r
(6) H = E ⊗A L\r
2\r
(X, λ) = eL2(X, λ)\r
n = L2\r
(X, λ, S).\r
This shows that the weak closure A′′ = A′′ of A in H is given by the diagonal\r
action of L∞(X, λ) in eL2(X, λ)\r
n. Thus, since T ∈ A′′, there exists f ∈ L∞(X, λ)\r
such that T = ef. It follows that the matrix eae belongs to the center of eMn(A)e.\r
This center is e(1 ⊗ A) and thus T agrees with an element of A which proves the\r
implication 4) ⇒ 1). To be more specific, and for later use, let us give a formula\r
for an element x ∈ A such that T = ex in term of the matrix elements tij ∈ A of\r
T = e[aij ]e. First the fact that T belongs to the center of the algebra B = eMn(A)e\r
of endomorphisms of H∞ can be seen directly since any such endomorphism S is\r
automatically continuous in H using (6). Thus since T ∈ A′′ one has ST = TS.\r
Since\r
P\r
e is a self-adjoint idempotent and A injects in C(X) the element τ = Tr(e) =\r
ejj ∈ A is determined by its image in A which is just the function χ ∈ X 7→\r
dimSχ ∈ {0, 1, . . ., n}. This determines n + 1 self-adjoint idempotents pj ∈ A by\r
(7) τ = Tr(e) = Xj pj\r
Xpj = 1 .\r
To check that pj ∈ A it is enough to show that pj = Pj (τ) where Pj is a polynomial\r
with\r
(8) Pj (k) = 0 , ∀k 6= j , 0 ≤ k ≤ n , Pj (j) = 1 .\r
One then has the following formula5for x:\r
(9) x = (Xtii)\r
X\r
j>0\r
1\r
j\r
pj ∈ A .\r
As T belongs to the center of eMn(C(X))e one gets an equality T = ef for f ∈\r
C(X) and working at every point χ ∈ X one then shows that T = ex.\r
The implication 1) ⇒ 2) follows from the regularity, and 2) ⇒ 3) is immediate. To\r
show the implication 3) ⇒ 4) one uses the definition of H∞ as the intersection of\r
domains of powers of |D| and the implication\r

This shows that the whole geometric data (A, H, D) is in fact uniquely determined\r
by the triple (A′′, H, D) where A′′ is a commutative von Neumann algebra.\r
This also shows that A is a pre-C\r
∗\r
-algebra, i.e. that it is stable under the holo\u0002morphic functional calculus in the C\r
∗\r
-algebra norm closure of A, A = A. Since we\r
assumed that A was commutative, so is A and by Gelfand’s theorem A = C(X)\r
is the algebra of continuous complex valued functions on X = Spec(A). We note\r
finally that characters χ of A are automatically self-adjoint: χ(a\r
∗\r
) = χ(a) since\r
the spectrum of self-adjoint elements of A is real. Also they are automatically\r
continuous since the C\r
∗\r
-norm is uniquely determined algebraically by\r
kak = sup{|λ| | a\r
∗\r
a − λ\r
2 ∈ A/−1\r
}\r
thus they extend automatically to A by continuity so that\r
SpecA = SpecA .\r
We shall now show that A is a Frechet algebra i.e. a complete locally convex algebra\r
whose topology is defined by the submultiplicative norms\r
(11) pk(xy) ≤ pk(x)pk(y), ∀x, y ∈ A\r
associated to the regularity condition, for instance by\r
(12) pk(x) = kρk(x)k , ρk(x) =\r
\r
\r
x δ(x) . . . δk(x)/k!\r
0 x . . . . . .\r
. . . . . . x δ(x)\r
0 . . . 0 x\r
\r
\r
since ρk is a representation of A.\r
Proposition 2.2. (1) The unbounded derivation δ is a closed operator in L(H).\r
(2) The algebra A endowed with the norms pk is a Frechet algebra.\r
7

(3) The semi-norms pk([D, a]) = p\r
′\r
k\r
(a) are continuous.\r
Proof. (1) Let G(|D|) be the graph of |D|. The graph of δ is\r
G(δ) = {(T, S) ∈ L(H)\r
2\r
| (Tξ, Tη + Sξ) ∈ G(|D|), ∀(ξ, η) ∈ G(|D|)} .\r
It is therefore closed.\r
(2) Let us show that A is complete. Let an ∈ A be a sequence which is a Cauchy\r
sequence in any of the norms pk. Then an → T in norm, so that T ∈ A ⊂ A′′. Since\r
δ is a closed operator one has T ∈ Domδ and δ(an) → δ(T ) in norm. By induction\r
one gets, using the closedness of δ that T ∈ Domδ\r
k and δk\r
(T ) = lim δ\r
k\r
(an). Thus\r
T ∈ ∩Domδ\r
m and by Lemma 2.1, we get T ∈ A. Furthermore we also have the\r
norm convergence δ\r
k\r
(T ) = lim δ\r
k\r
(an). This shows that the an converge to T in the\r
topology of the norms pk and hence that A is a Frechet space.\r
(3) Let us show that if we adjoin the semi-norms p\r
′\r
k\r
to the topology of A we still get\r
a complete space. The argument of the proof of (1) only uses the closedness of the\r
operator |D| and thus we get in the same way that the derivation T → d(T ) = [D, T ]\r
with domain Domd = {T ∈ L(H)| TDomD ⊂ DomD , k[D, T ]k < ∞} is closed for\r
the norm topology of L(H). Thus the above proof of completeness applies. The\r
result then follows from the open mapping Theorem ([24] Corollary 2.12) applied\r
to the identity map from A endowed with the topology of the pk, p\r
′\r
k\r
to A endowed\r
with the topology of the pk. \u0003\r
In fact Lemma 2.1 shows that one has Sobolev estimates, using finitely many gen\u0002erators ηµ of the A-module H∞ to define the Sobolev norms on A as\r

Proposition 2.3. (1) When endowed with the norms (13), A is a Frechet sep\u0002arable nuclear space.\r

(3) The spectrum X = Spec(A) is metrizable.\r
(4) Any T ∈ EndAH∞ is continuous in H∞ and extends continuously to a\r
bounded operator in H.\r
(5) The algebraic isomorphism H∞ = eAn is topological.\r
(6) The map (a, ξ) 7→ aξ and the A-valued inner product are jointly continuous\r
A × H∞ → H∞ and H∞ × H∞ → A.\r
Proof. 1) By construction the family (13) is an increasing sequence of norms. Let\r
us show that A is complete. Let an be a sequence of elements of A such that the\r
vectors (1 + D2)\r
s/2anηµ converge for all s (and all µ). We then obtain vectors\r
ζµ = lim anηµ ∈ H∞ , ∀µ ,\r
where the convergence holds in the topology of H∞. Let then T be the operator\r
given by\r

Pb\r
µηµ with bµ\r
P\r
∈ A which gives anξ =\r
b\r
µanηµ which converges, in the topology of H∞, to Pbµζµ since the bµ are\r
continuous linear maps on H∞ using (10) and regularity. Thus T is a linear map\r
on H∞ and it commutes with A i.e. it is an endomorphism of this finite projective\r
module. Thus T is of the form (4) and in particular it is bounded in H. Also since\r
endomorphisms of the finite projective module are automatically continuous in H\r
they commute with T using (15). Thus the argument of Lemma 2.1 shows that\r
T ∈ A. Moreover, since the convergence (15) holds in the topology of H∞, one has\r
an → T in the Sobolev topology and A is complete in that topology. Thus A is a\r
Frechet space. It is by construction a closed subspace of the sum of finitely many\r
spaces H∞ each being a separable nuclear space (of sequences of rapid decay). Thus\r
it is a separable nuclear space.\r
2) The identity map from the Frechet algebra A with the norms pk to the Frechet\r
space A with the Sobolev topology, is continuous (using (10)) and surjective. Hence\r
the open mapping Theorem ([24] Corollary 2.12) asserts that it is an open mapping.\r
This shows that the inverse map is continuous which gives the required estimates\r
for the norms pk. The result for the semi-norms pk([D, a]) follows from Proposition\r
2.2.\r
3) Since A is a Frechet separable nuclear space there is a sequence xn ∈ A which\r
is dense in any of the continuous norms and in particular using 2) in the p0 norm.\r
This shows that the C\r
∗\r
-algebra A is norm separable and hence that its spectrum\r
is metrizable.\r
4) By hypothesis T being an endomorphism is of the form (4). Using the inclusion\r
A ⊂ A = C(X) of A in its norm closure, we can view T as an endomorphism of the\r
induced C\r
∗\r
-module E over A. By (6), any element of EndA(E) defines a bounded\r
operator in H. This shows that the graph of the operator T in H∞ × H∞ is closed\r
and hence by the closed graph theorem that T is continuous in the Frechet topology\r
of H∞.\r
5) The product A × A → A is jointly continuous using the submultiplicative norms\r
pk of (12). This shows that eAn is a closed subspace of An and hence is complete.\r
Moreover the map (aj ) 7→\r
Paj ξj for given ξj ∈ H∞ is continuous from An to H∞\r
using (10). Thus the open mapping theorem gives the result.\r
6) Follows from 5) and the joint continuity of the product A × A → A. \u0003\r
We end this section with the stability of A under the smooth functional calculus\r
as shown in [22] Proposition 2.8. We repeat the proof for convenience.\r
Proposition 2.4. Let aj = a\r

We first briefly recall first the well known properties of multiple commutators which\r
we need later.\r
Definition 4.1. Let Tj ∈ B be elements of a noncommutative algebra B, one lets\r
[T1, T2, . . . , Tn] = X\r
σ\r
ǫ(σ) Tσ(1)Tσ(2) · · · Tσ(n)\r
where σ varies through all permutations of {1, . . ., n} and ǫ(σ) is its signature.\r
We mention the following general properties\r
Proposition 4.2. Let Tj ∈ B be elements of a noncommutative algebra B.\r
a) For any permutation α of {1, . . ., n}, one has\r
[Tα(1), Tα(2), . . . , Tα(n)] = ǫ(α) [T1, T2, . . . , Tn]\r
12

b) If two of the Tj are equal one has\r
[T1, T2, . . . , Tn] = 0\r
c) Let A ⊂ B be a commutative subalgebra and A′ ⊂ B its relative commutant\r
in B. Let a\r
j\r
k ∈ A, γj ∈ A′\r
. Then, with Tk =\r
Pa\r

(28) [T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = Det((a\r

k ∈ A as\r
follows\r
(29) [T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = X\r
F\r
Det((a\r

(F) is the restriction of a\r

Proof. a) This follows from ǫ(σ ◦ α) = ǫ(σ)ǫ(α).\r
b) The permutation of the two indices is odd, but does not affect the expression\r
which must vanish.\r

second statement of the lemma, these terms vanish when two of the indices jk are\r
equal. Thus one can take the sum over permutations (jk) and one can use the first\r
statement of the lemma to rewrite the corresponding term as\r
[γj1, γj2, . . ., γjn] = ǫ(j) [γ1, γ2, . . ., γn]\r
It follows that\r
[T1, T2, . . ., Tn] = Det((a\r

d) One decomposes the sum (30) according to the range F of the injection j from\r
{1, . . ., n} to {1, . . ., m}. \u0003\r
Let us now go back to spectral triples (A, H, D) fulfilling the five conditions of §2.\r
Lemma 4.3. Let B be the algebra of endomorphisms of H∞. One has a finite\r
decomposition\r
(31) [D, a] = Xδj (a)γj , ∀a ∈ A ,\r
where γj ∈ B and the δj are derivations of the form\r
(32) δj (a) = i(ξj |[D, a]ξj ), ∀a ∈ A\r
for some ξj ∈ H∞.\r
Proof. First [D, a]H∞ ⊂ H∞ using regularity and (10). Thus the order one condi\u0002tion shows that [D, a] ∈ B. One has H∞ = eAn, B = eMn(A)e for a self-adjoint\r
idempotent e ∈ Mn(A). Thus every element T ∈ B can be written uniquely, as any\r
element of Mn(A) in the form\r
T =\r
Xakℓεkℓ , akℓ ∈ A\r
13

in terms of the matrix units εij . The coefficients akℓ ∈ A are uniquely determined,\r
using the elements ηk = eζk ∈ H∞ where ζk ∈ An is the element all of whose\r
components vanish except the k-th one which is equal to 1. Using the A-valued\r
inner product, one has\r
(33) akℓ = (ηk|Tηℓ) = Lkℓ(T ), ∀k, ℓ .\r
Moreover one has, since T = eTe and the akℓ commute with e:\r
(34) T =\r
Xakℓeεkℓe .\r
One has Lkℓ(aT ) = aLkℓ(T ) for any a ∈ A. Applying this to T = [D, b], the\r
maps a 7→ Lij ([D, a]) give derivations of A. They are not self-adjoint but can be\r
decomposed as linear combinations of self-adjoint derivations, which, using (34),\r
gives the required formula (31). More precisely, the derivations δj can be written\r
using the A-valued inner product on H∞ in the form (32) for some ξj ∈ H∞\r
(with i to ensure self-adjointness). Indeed one obtains (32) applying to (33) the\r
polarization identity:\r
(35) 2(ξ|Tη) = ((ξ + η)|T (ξ + η)) − (ξ|Tξ) − (η|Tη)\r
−i(((ξ + iη)|T (ξ + iη)) − (ξ|Tξ) − (iη|Tiη))\r
In particular, using Proposition 2.3, the δj are continuous. \u0003\r

• The map aα from Uα to R\r

Proof. We let, as above, B be the algebra of endomorphisms of the A-module H∞.\r

δj ∈ Der(A) of the form (32), such that the formula (31) holds:\r
[D, a] = Xm\r

[[D, a1\r
α], [D, a2α], . . . , [D, apα]](χ) 6= 0 , ∀χ ∈ Uα .\r

δj ∈ Der(A) among the above δj such that:\r

one. We need a form of existence and uniqueness for solutions of linear differential\r
equations with values in a Frechet space E. Simple examples show that in that\r

A = C∞([0, 1]), δ0 = ∂x. For failure of uniqueness, let E be the space of sequences\r

t x1(0) = 0, and then define by induction xn+1(t) =\r
∂txn(t) so that ∂tx = Sx holds and the initial condition x(0) = 0 does not imply\r
uniqueness.\r
In our case we need to know that any derivation δ ∈ DerA can be exponentiated,\r
i.e. that one has existence and uniqueness for the differential equation\r
dy(t)\r
dt = δ(y(t)), y(t) ∈ A .\r
It is only the compactness of X that ensures this, and also the fact that one is\r
dealing with a real vector field. This means that we first need to make sure that\r
the derivation exponentiates at the level of the C\r
∗\r
-algebra as discussed in [2].\r
One step towards this would be to show directly the following corollary of expability:\r
Lemma 5.1. Assume that the derivations of the form the form (32) exponentiate,\r
then, for any h = h\r
∗ ∈ A, the commutator [D, h] vanishes where7 h reaches its\r
maximum. Conversely if this property holds the derivations ±δj of the form (32)\r
are dissipative (cf. [2], Definition 1.4.6), i.e.\r
(42) kx + λδj (x)k ≥ kxk , ∀x ∈ A , λ ∈ R .\r
Proof. One has, by (31), [D, h] = Pδj (h)γj where δj ∈ DerA. Thus it is enough\r
to show that δj (h)(χ) = 0 where h = h\r
∗ ∈ A reaches its maximum at χ. This\r
follows from the existence of e\r
tδj ∈ Aut(A) using the differentiable function f(t) =\r
χ(e\r
tδj (h)) which has a maximum at t = 0 and hence vanishing derivative.\r
Conversely, the derivations δj are of the form (32) i.e. δj (h) = i(ξ|[D, h]ξ). Thus\r
the vanishing of [D, h](χ) where h = h\r
∗ ∈ A reaches its maximum, ensures that\r
δj(h)(χ) = ihξ(χ), [D, h](χ)ξ(χ)i = 0 also vanishes. Thus one has\r
kh + λδj (h)k ≥ khk , ∀h = h\r
∗ ∈ A , λ ∈ R ,\r
7This makes sense since [D, h] commutes with h\r
16

since for a character χ of A with χ(±h) = khk one has χ(±(h + λδj (h))) = khk. In\r
the complex case i.e. for an arbitrary x ∈ A, let ψ be a state on A ⊃ A, such that\r
|ψ(x)| = kxk. Replacing x 7→ ux for u ∈ C, |u| = 1, one can assume that ψ(x) > 0.\r
Then writing x = h + ik with h = h\r
∗ and k = k∗\r
, one has ψ(x) = ψ(h) = khk so\r
that ψ(δj (h)) = 0 from the above discussion. Then one has, for λ ∈ R,\r
ψ(x + λδj (x)) = ψ(h) + iλψ(δj (k))\r
and |ψ(x + λδj (x))| ≥ ψ(h) = kxk. \u0003\r
Note that the commutativity of [D, h] with h and the self-adjointness of D do not\r
suffice to entail the conclusion of Lemma 5.1. This can be seen with the following\r
spectral triple:\r
(43) A = C\r
∞([0, 1]), H = L2\r

For any h ∈ A one has [D, h] = ∂xhγ1,\r
γ1 =\r
\u0012\r
0 1\r
−1 0 \u0013\r
so that [D, h] commutes with h. For h(x) = x the maximum is at x = 1 and [D, h]\r
does not vanish there. This example shows that the hypothesis of expability of the\r
algebra A appears at first sight as essential. However, in this example, condition 5\r
fails since the boundary condition (44) does not yield a finite projective submodule\r
of C∞([0, 1]) ⊗ C\r
2 over A = C∞([0, 1]). Also [D, h] = ∂xhγ1 does not preserve\r
the domain of D which is the same as the domain of |D| thus regularity fails.\r
Orientability also fails in this example. We shall now show that regularity allows\r
in fact to obtain the required dissipativity.\r

extension using the inclusion C\r

(h) ⊂ C. The function\r
f(s) = φ(αs(h))\r
is a Lipschitz function and reaches its maximum: khk at s = 0. Thus if one could\r
assert that the derivative at s = 0 is given by φ([D, h]), one would get the vanishing\r
φ([D, h]) = 0. The problem is that αu([D, h]) is not in general a norm continuous\r
function of u and thus the differentiability only holds in the strong topology but\r
not in the norm topology.\r

[D, h] vanishes at χ.\r

We shall use the analogue in our context of the notion of symbol for pseudodiffer\u0002ential operators. The symbol of T can be viewed as a weak limit of the conjugate\r

This is obtained by squaring (55) but one needs to know that DomD is invariant\r
under [D, φ] to control the term D [D, φ]. This is insured by regularity.\r
Remark 5.5. In the example (43) considered above, [D, φ] does not map DomD2\r
to DomD so that D [D, φ]ξ does not make sense in that case. In fact regularity\r
fails, and DomD2is not invariant under φ, unless [D, φ] vanishes on the boundary.\r
To see this note that the boundary condition for D2is\r

∂xφξ2(0) = ∂xφ(0)ξ2(0) vanishes only when ∂xφ(0) = 0.\r
In the case of an operator of order 0 there is no power of τ and one deals with a\r
bounded family so that one can expect the limit to be a weak limit. We need to\r
guess the symbol of [|D|, h]. We expect that if we choose φ = h, this symbol will just\r
be i|[D, h]| ∈ End S. The symbol of [D2, h] is (using [D2, h] = D[D, h] + [D, h]D)\r

Corollary 6.3. Let ϕ = ϕ\r

Proof. One has H = ϕ\r
2D + ϕ[D, ϕ] on DomD. The bounded perturbation P =\r
ϕ[D, ϕ] does not alter the domain of the adjoint H∗ which is thus the same as\r
the domain of H∗\r

2D. By Lemma 6.2, the adjoint of H0 is the closure of\r
Dϕ2 with domain DomD. This is the same as the closure of ϕDϕ + [D, ϕ]ϕ with\r
domain DomD. Since [D, ϕ]ϕ is bounded we thus get that the adjoint H∗\r
0 of H0\r
is the sum of the closure of ϕDϕ with domain DomD with the bounded operator\r
[D, ϕ]ϕ. Thus when adding P\r

0 we obtain the closure of ϕDϕ\r
with domain DomD, i.e. the operator H. \u0003\r

Proposition 6.5. Let A be regular then the operator H = A∗DA with domain\r

Proof. Let us first check that H is symmetric. One has for ξ and η in DomD,\r
hHξ, ηi = hA\r
∗DAξ, ηi = hDAξ, Aηi = hAξ, DAηi = hξ, A∗DAηi = hξ, Hηi\r
Let us now show that H∗is the closure of H. Let η ∈ DomH∗. Then there exists\r
C < ∞ with\r
|hA\r
∗DAξ, ηi| ≤ Ckξk , ∀ξ ∈ DomD .\r
Since hA∗DAξ, ηi = hDAξ, Aηi, this means that Aη is in the domain of the adjoint\r

Aη ∈ DomT\r

(A∗D)\r

is the closure A∗D = (A∗D)\r

in the domain of A∗D, the convergence of A∗D(1 + ǫ|D|)\r

Moreover, as above, we have\r

that for any η ∈ DomH∗ one gets the convergence of A∗DA(1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1η to H∗η.\r
This shows, since (1 + ǫ|D|)\r
−1η ∈ DomH, that H∗\r
is the closure of H and hence\r
that H is essentially self-adjoint. It also gives a characterization of the domain of\r
the closure of H as required. \u0003\r
We now want to apply this result using endomorphisms of the A-module H∞ which\r
are of rank one, in order to obtain an operator on A itself.\r
Lemma 6.6. Let ξ, η ∈ H∞ then the following gives an endomorphism of the\r
A-module H∞:\r
(91) Tξ,η(ζ) = (η|ζ)ξ , ∀ζ ∈ H∞\r

where (η|ζ) is the A-valued inner product. One has\r
(92) Taξ, bη = ab∗Tξ,η , ∀a, b ∈ A , T ∗\r
ξ,η = Tη,ξ\r
Proof. This follows from the A-linearity of the inner product, which is linear in the\r
second variable and antilinear in the first. The equality T\r

By Proposition 2.3 (4), the Tξ,η are bounded operators in H. Let us now assume\r
that all endomorphisms of the A-module H∞ are regular as in Definition 6.1. We\r
can then apply Proposition 6.5 and get that the following defines an essentially\r
self-adjoint operator with domain DomD,\r
(93) Dξ, η = Tη, ξ D Tξ, η\r
We need to relate this operator with the derivation of A given by (32) i.e.\r
(94) δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A\r
Lemma 6.7. One has\r
(95) Dξ, ηζ = −i δ0((η|ζ)) η + (ξ|Dξ)Tη, ηζ , ∀ξ, η, ζ ∈ H∞\r
The operator Vη(a) = aη, ∀a ∈ A extends to a bounded linear map Vη from\r

−iδ0(a) and (ξ|aDξ)η = (ξ|Dξ)aη for a = (η|ζ) one gets\r
Dξ, ηζ = (ξ|Daξ)η = (ξ|[D, a]ξ)η + (ξ|Dξ)aη = −iδ0((η|ζ))η + (ξ|Dξ)Tη, ηζ\r
which gives (95). To show that Vη is bounded, note that\r

(η|ζ) = b. One then has, at the formal level\r
(98) b + ǫδ0(b)(η|η) = a(η|η)\r
We can assume that the support of ξ is small enough so that we can find η such\r
that (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood of the support K of ξ. Then by (94) one gets that\r
since δ0 vanishes outside K, one can replace δ0(b)(η|η) in (98) by δ0(b). Moreover\r
one then gets\r
(99) c + ǫδ0(c) = a , c = b + (1 − (η|η))a\r

Thus the answer follows for k = 1 since both (D2 + λ)\r

compact operators which converge in norm to 0 when λ → ∞. Since Eλ(T ) is also\r
regular it follows also for k > 1.\r
2) The first inequality of (103) follows from (104). For the second, one has\r

kDEλ(T )k ≤ kEλ(T )|D|k + kEλ(δ(T ))k\r

One has ζ = (D2 + λ)\r
−N ζ′ ∈ H2N ⊂ DomD and (D2 + λ)−N ζn → (D2 + λ)−N ζ′\r
in the topology of DomD. Thus\r
(1 + iǫ(Dξ, η − (ξ|Dξ)Tη, η))ζ = ξ\r
and ζ ∈ H2N gives the required solution. \u0003\r

Theorem 6.11. Let (A, H, D) be a strongly regular spectral triple with A commu\u0002tative, fulfilling the five conditions of §2. Then any derivation of A of the form (32)\r
i.e. δ0(a) = i(ξ|[D, a]ξ), ∀a ∈ A, is closable for the C\r

is the generator of a one-parameter group of automorphisms U(t) of A = C(X),\r
X = Spec(A).\r
Proof. By Corollary 5.14 the derivation δ0, with domain A ⊂ A, is dissipative for\r
the C\r

-norm of A. Thus it is closable ([2] Proposition 1.4.7) and we let D(δ0) be\r
the domain of its closure. To apply the Hille-Yosida-Lumer-Phillips Theorem we\r
need to show that for sufficiently small ǫ one has\r

By Corollary 5.14, we have\r

Thus (1 + ǫδ0)D(δ0) is closed in norm and it is enough to show that (1 + ǫδ0)A is\r
norm dense in A. Let then η ∈ H∞ be such that (η|η) = 1 in a neighborhood of the\r

Theorem X.47 a) shows that δ0 generates a contraction semi-group of A. Since the\r

(n)k1 < ∞,\r
one gets a dense domain of analytic elements and one checks that since δ0 is a\r
derivation on D(δ0) the U(t) are automorphisms of A. \u0003\r
It remains to show that the U(t) ∈ Aut(A) respect the smoothness. Let us first\r
show that we need only understand what happens to U(t)(a)η as an element of H\r
because U(t) is the identity in the complement of the support of ξ.\r
Lemma 6.12. Let x ∈ A have support disjoint from the support of ξ. Then\r
U(t)(x) = x for all t ∈ R.\r
Proof. We can assume that x ∈ A. Let us show that δ0(x) = 0. There exists\r
φ ∈ A with x = xφ2 and φξ = 0. One has δ0(x) = i(ξ|[D, x]ξ) and [D, x] =\r
[D, x]φ\r
2 + 2x[D, φ]φ so that [D, x]ξ = 0 and δ0(x) = 0. It follows that for f as in\r
(114), one gets δ0(U(f)(x)) = 0 since U(f) commutes with δ0. With f analytic\r
for L\r
1 one gets that U(f)(x) is an analytic element such that δ0(U(f)(x)) = 0 and\r
hence δ\r

(U(f)(x)) = 0 for all n ≥ 1. It follows that\r

(U(f)(x)) = U(f)(x), ∀t ∈ R\r

U(t)(x) = x for all t ∈ R. \u0003"""

We want to get an upper bound for the number of elements in the fiber of the\r
map sα : Uα → R\r
p\r
. We shall first relate the multiplicity of the map sα with\r
the spectral multiplicity of the operators a\r
j\r
α in the Hilbert space H. This is not\r
automatic, indeed the first difficulty is that for an injective representation π of a\r
C\r
∗\r
-algebra B with a subalgebra A ⊂ B, one can have the same double-commutants\r
π(A)\r
′′ = π(B)′′ even though A 6= B. Thus for instance one can take the subalgebra\r
C[0, 1] ⊂ C(K) where K = {0, 1, . . ., 9}\r
N is the Cantor set of the decimal digits\r
and the inclusion is given by the decimal expansion. Both act in L\r
2\r
[0, 1] (by\r
multiplication) and the spectral multiplicity of the function x ∈ C[0, 1] is equal\r
to one but the number of elements in the fiber is equal to 2 for numbers of the form\r
k 10−n. The point in this example is that the projection map s : K → [0, 1] is not\r
an open mapping. Thus in particular the subset of K where the multiplicity of s is\r
two is not an open subset of K (it is countable).\r
Lemma 8.1. Let s : X → Y be a continuous open map of compact spaces. Then\r
the function n(y) = #s\r
−1\r
(y) is lower semicontinuous on Y .\r
Proof. Assume that n(y) ≥ m and let us show that this inequality still holds in a\r
neighborhood of y. Let xj ∈ X be m distinct points in s\r
−1\r
(y). One can then find\r
disjoint open sets Vj ∋ xj and let W = ∩j s(Vj ) which is an open neighborhood of\r
y. For any z ∈ W the preimage s\r
−1\r
(z) contains at least m points. \u0003\r
Now, let s : X → Y be a continuous open map of compact spaces. Let µ be a\r
positive measure on X with support X and π the corresponding representation of\r
C(X) in L\r
2\r
(X, µ). We want to compare the spectral multiplicity function Σ(y) of\r
the restriction of π to C(Y ) with n(y) = #s\r

the measure µ. One can desintegrate µ in the form\r
µ =\r
Z\r
Y\r
ρy dν(y)\r
where the conditional measure ρy is supported by the closed subset s\r
−1\r
(y). The\r
issue is what is the dimension of the Hilbert space L\r
2\r
(X, ρy). It might seem at first\r
that if the support of the measure µ is X one should be able to conclude that the\r
support of ρy is s\r
−1\r
(y) and obtain that the spectral multiplicity function Σ(y) is\r
larger than n(y) = #s\r
−1\r
(y). However this fails as shown by the following example:\r
X = Y × {1, . . ., m} , s(y, k) = y\r
and let µk be the measure on Y corresponding to the restriction of µ to Y × {k}.\r
Lemma 8.2. If the measures µk are mutually singular then the spectral multiplicity\r
function Σ(y) is equal to 1 a.e. .\r
Proof. The representations of C(Y ) in L\r
2\r
(Y, µk) are pairwise disjoint, and each\r
is of multiplicity one. Thus the commutant of C(Y ) in the direct sum of these\r
representations only contains block diagonal operators and is hence commutative\r
so that the multiplicity is equal to one. \u0003\r
The above example gives the needed condition for the relation between Σ(y) and\r

using the assumed equivalence of s(λ|V ) with the restriction of ν to s(V ).\r
Let us prove (150). Let y ∈ W with n(y) = #{s\r

let Z = ∩j s(Bj ) which is an open neighborhood of y. For any z ∈ Z the preimage\r

Remark 9.6. In order not to depend on interpolation theory we give a direct proof\r
of (174). We assume that p > 1. First, for p > 1 an equivalent norm on L\r

(175) kT k(p,1)′ = (1 − θ)\r
XN\r

where σN (T ) is the sum of the first N characteristic values. The equivalence of the\r

max k[A, aj 1K]kJ . One takes\r
Aǫ = P + (1 − P)Rǫ(1 − P),\r
so that A ≥ P by construction. Moreover one has\r
(179) Rǫ − Aǫ = P(Rǫ − 1)P + PRǫ(1 − P) + (1 − P)RǫP .\r
Moreover by the strong convergence Rǫ → 1, one has\r
kP(Rǫ − 1)k∞ = k(Rǫ − 1)Pk∞ → 0\r
so that all three terms in the rhs of (179) converge to 0 in norm and hence in the\r
J norm since their rank is less than N so that one can use (154). Thus one has\r
kRǫ − AǫkJ → 0\r

We shall now use Lemma 10.3 together with the ability to move around in X by\r
automorphisms of A to prove the following key Lemma:\r
Lemma 11.1. For every point χ ∈ X there exists p real elements x\r
µ ∈ A and a\r
smooth family τt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, τ0 = Id, such that\r
• The x\r
µ give an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of χ with an open set in\r
R\r
p\r
.\r
• The map t 7→ h(t) = χ ◦ τt is an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of 0 in\r
R\r
p with a neighborhood of χ.\r
• The map x ◦ h is a local diffeomorphism.\r
Proof. Let χ ∈ X. By Lemma 4.4, there exists α such that χ ∈ Uα. By Lemma\r
4.5, there exists a smooth family σt ∈ Aut(A), t ∈ R\r
p\r
, a neighborhood Z of χ in\r
X = Spec(A) and a neighborhood W of 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
such that, for any κ ∈ Z, the\r
map t 7→ sα(κ ◦ σt) is a diffeomorphism, depending continuously on κ, of W with\r
a neighborhood of sα(κ) in R\r
p\r
.\r
We now take for V a ball\r
V = Br = {y ∈ X | d(χ, y) < r} ⊂ Uα , V ⊂ Uα .\r
We apply Lemma 10.3 to V = Br and let Y be a dense open subset Y ⊂ sα(V )\r
such that every point of s\r
−1\r
α (Y ) ∩ V has a neighborhood N in X such that the\r
restriction of sα to N is an homeomorphism with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Since Y is\r
dense in sα(V ), and by Lemma 4.5 the image of W by t 7→ ψ(t) = sα(χ ◦ σt) is an\r
open neighborhood of sα(χ) one can choose a u0 ∈ W such that χ ◦ σu0 ∈ V and\r
ψ(u0) = sα(χ ◦ σu0) ∈ Y . One has κ = χ ◦ σu0 ∈ s\r
−1\r
α (Y ) ∩ V . Thus by Lemma\r
10.3 there exists a neighborhood N of κ such that the restriction of sα to N is an\r
isomorphism with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Thus the a\r
µ\r
α are good local coordinates near\r
κ. The automorphism σu0 ∈ Aut(A) is such that\r
(189) κ = χ ◦ σu0, χ = σu0(κ)\r
Recall that we use the covariant notation (131). We take\r
(190) x\r
µ = σu0\r
(a\r
µ\r
α)\r
as local coordinates near χ. The corresponding map x from X = Spec(A) to R\r
p\r
is\r
given by\r
ζ ∈ X 7→ ζ(x\r
µ\r
) = ζ(σu0(a\r
µ\r
α)) = sα(ζ ◦ σu0\r
) = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
(ζ)\r
Thus x = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
and, since σu0is an homeomorphism of X, x = sα ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
is an\r
homeomorphism of the neighborhood σu0(N) of χ with an open set of R\r
p\r
. Thus\r
the x\r
µ are good local coordinates at χ. Then let τt ∈ Aut(A) be given by\r
τt = σu0+t ◦ σ\r
−1\r
u0\r
50

so that τt ◦ σu0 = σu0+t. One has\r
χ ◦ τt(x\r

α)) = χ ◦ σu0+t(a\r
µ\r
α) = s\r
µ\r
α(χ ◦ σu0+t) = ψ\r
µ\r
(u0 + t)\r
Now the map h is given by t 7→ h(t) = χ ◦ τt thus one has\r
(191) x ◦ h(t) = ψ(u0 + t)\r
This shows that the map x ◦ h is a diffeomorphism from W1 = W − u0 (which\r
is a neighborhood of t = 0 ∈ R\r
p\r
since u0 ∈ W) with an open set of R\r
p\r
. On\r
W1, the map h is injective since x ◦ h is injective. Thus h is an homeomorphism\r
with its range. One has h(0) = χ, h is continuous thus W2 = h\r
−1\r
(σu0(N)) ∩\r
W1 is an open set containing 0 and W′\r
2 = x ◦ h(W2) is an open set in R\r

map x is an homeomorphism of σu0\r
(N) with an open set in R\r

h(W2) = x\r
−1\r
(W′\r
2\r
) ∩ σu0(N) is open in σu0(N) and since it contains h(0) = χ we\r
get that h is an homeomorphism of a neighborhood of 0 in R\r
p with a neighborhood\r
of χ. Moreover, as we have seen above, the map x ◦ h is a diffeomorphism. \u0003\r
Lemma 11.2. The algebra A is locally the algebra of restrictions of smooth func\u0002tions on R\r
p\r
to a bounded open set of R\r
p\r
.\r
Proof. Let χ ∈ X. By Lemma 11.1, we can assume that some x\r
µ ∈ A give an\r
homeomorphism of a neighborhood U of χ with a bounded open set x(U) ⊂ R\r
p\r
.\r
By the smooth functional calculus the algebra C∞\r
c\r
(x(U)) is contained in A using\r
the morphism f ∈ C∞\r
c\r
(x(U)) 7→ f(x\r
µ) ∈ A . Moreover for any κ ∈ U one has\r
κ(f(x\r
µ\r
)) = f(κ(x\r
µ\r
) so that the function f ◦ x coincides on U with the element\r
f(x\r
µ) ∈ A. Taking a smaller neighborhood V of χ with compact closure in U one\r
gets that the algebra C∞(R\r
p\r
)|x(V ) of restrictions to x(V ) of smooth functions on R\r
p\r
is contained in the algebra of restrictions to V of elements of A, using x to identify\r
V with the open set x(V ) ⊂ R\r
p\r
. We need to show that any element of A restricts\r
to a smooth function on V , using the local coordinates x to define smoothness. For\r
this we use (Lemma 11.1) the existence of a smooth family τ : R\r
p → Aut(A) such\r
that x ◦ τ is a local diffeomorphism around χ. Thus given b ∈ A, to show that the\r
restriction of b to V is smooth, it is enough to show that τt(b) evaluated at χ is a\r
smooth function of t. This follows from the smoothness of the family τt. \u0003\r
Theorem 11.3. Let (A, H, D) be a strongly regular spectral triple fulfilling the\r
five conditions of §2 (cf. [11]) with c antisymmetric Then there exists an oriented\r
smooth compact manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
Proof. We let X = Spec(A) be the spectrum of A or equivalently of the norm\r
closure A. By construction it is a compact space. By Lemma 11.1, for every point\r
χ ∈ X there exists a neighborhood U of χ and p real elements x\r
µ ∈ A which give a\r
local homeomorphism φ of a neighborhood V of x with an open set in R\r
p\r
. Moreover\r
by Lemma 11.2 one has\r
f ∈ A|V ⇔ f ◦ φ\r
−1 ∈ C∞(Rp\r
)|φ(V )\r
This shows that on the intersection of such domains of local charts, the change\r
of chart is of class C∞. We can thus, using compactness, take a finite cover and\r
this endows X with a structure of p-dimensional smooth manifold. Lemma 11.2\r
shows that any a ∈ A restricts to a smooth function in each local chart and thus\r
A ⊂ C∞(X). Moreover given f ∈ C∞(X) there exists for each Vj in the finite open\r
51

cover of X an aj ∈ A with f|Vj = aj |Vj\r
. Then the existence of partitions of unity\r
(Lemma 2.10 of [22]):\r
ψj ∈ A ,\r
Xψj = 1 , Support ψj ⊂ Vj\r
shows that f agrees with Pψjaj ∈ A. We have shown that there exists a smooth\r
compact manifold X such that A = C∞(X). The cycle c gives a nowhere vanishing\r
section of the real exterior power ∧\r
p\r
(TX) and hence shows that the manifold X is\r
oriented. \u0003\r
We thus obtain the following characterization of the algebras C∞(X):\r
Theorem 11.4. An involutive algebra A is the algebra of smooth functions on an\r
oriented smooth compact manifold if and only if it admits a faithful 14 represen\u0002tation in a pair (H, D) fulfilling the five conditions of §2 (cf. [11]) with the cycle\r
antisymmetric and the strong regularity.\r
Proof. The direct implication follows from Theorem 11.3. Conversely, given an\r

The condition of strong regularity is checked using §13. One applies Lemma 13.2 to\r
obtain the strong regularity since we take for D an elliptic differential operator of\r
order one on a smooth compact manifold and the principal symbol of D2is a scalar\r
multiple of the identity. This ensures that for any differential operator P of order\r
m the symbol of order m + 2 of [D2, P] vanishes as it is given by the commutator\r
of the principal symbols of order m and 2. Thus one gets that for any differential\r
operator T of order 0, the operators δ\r
m\r

−m/2 where\r
P is a differential operator of order m. Thus the theory of elliptic operators (cf.\r
[15] Lemma 1.3.4 and 1.3.5) shows that they are bounded. This applies for D the\r
Dirac operator or the signature operator, thus one gets the strong regularity in this\r
case. \u0003\r
Theorem 11.5. Let (A, H, D) be a spectral triple with A commutative, fulfilling the\r

. Then there exists a smooth oriented compact\r
(spinc) manifold X such that A = C∞(X).\r
Proof. We need to show that we can dispense with the hypothesis of strong regu\u0002larity in Theorem 11.3. Indeed by the first part of Remark 5.12, we get\r
(197) [([D, a][D, b] + [D, b][D, a]), [D, c]] = 0 , ∀a, b, c ∈ A\r
since this is implied by the commutation (78) of |[D, h]| with [D, c]. Thus if we work\r
at a point χ ∈ Spec(A) and let Sχ be the fiber at χ ∈ X of the finite projective\r
module H∞ and Mχ ⊂ EndSχ be the subalgebra generated by the [D, a] for a ∈ A,\r
it follows from (197) that\r
(198) [D, a][D, b] + [D, b][D, a] ∈ Z(Mχ), ∀a, b ∈ A\r

the weak density in M of\r
(202) C\r

We now come to two equations which assert that A = C∞(M, H, D) is large enough,\r
so that we have maximal compatibility. One checks that H∞ = ∩DomDm is\r

Theorem 12.1. Let (M, H, D) fulfill (202), (203) and (204), and N = 2p/2, then\r
there exists a unique smooth compact oriented spinc Riemannian manifold (X, g)\r
such that the triple (M, H, D) is given by\r
• M = L∞(X, dv) where dv is the Riemannian volume form.\r
• H = L\r
2\r
(X, S) where S is the spinor bundle.\r
• D is a Dirac operator associated to the Riemannian metric g.\r
Proof. We let A = C∞(M, H, D). By the weak density in M of (202), we know\r
that the multiplicity of the action of A′′ = M in H is N = 2p/2. By construction\r
the triple (A, H, D) fulfills the first three conditions . The fourth and fifth follow\r
from (203) and (204). Thus by Theorem 11.5 we get that A = C∞(X) for a smooth\r
oriented compact spinc manifold X. The conclusion then follows from [11] (see [14]\r
for the detailed proof). Note that there is no uniqueness of D since we only know\r
its principal symbol. This is discussed in [11] and [14]. \u0003\r

(2) The unitary relation F between the Hilbert space of the canonical pair\r

Of course the conceptual meaning of the unitary F is the Fourier transform, but\r
this second piece of data is now playing a role entirely similar to that of the CKM\r
matrix in the Standard Model [6]. Moreover, in the latter, the information about\r
the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs fields with the Fermions (quarks and leptons) is\r

The condition of regularity is not easy to check for smooth manifolds since it involves\r
the module of the operator D. We give below the equivalent formulation in terms\r
of D2(cf. [13]).\r
We deal with operators T which act on H∞ = ∩DomDn. We say that T is bounded\r
when\r
(208) kT k = sup{kTξk | ξ ∈ H∞ , kξk ≤ 1}\r
is finite. We still denote by T the unique continuous extension to a bounded\r
operator in H. By self-adjointness of D the domain H∞ is a core for powers of\r
D or of |D|. The derivation δ(T ) = [|D|, T ] is defined algebraically as an operator\r
in H∞. The relation with the commutator in H is given as follows.\r
Lemma 13.1. Assume that both T and [|D|, T ] are bounded (as in (208)). Then\r
T preserves Dom|D| = DomD and the bounded extension of [|D|, T ] coincides with\r
the commutator |D|T − T |D| on Dom|D|.\r
Proof. Let ξ ∈ Dom|D|. There exists a sequence ξn ∈ H∞ with ξn → ξ and\r
|D|ξn → |D|ξ. Since T is bounded the sequences Tξn and T |D|ξn are convergent\r
and converge to Tξ and T |D|ξ. Since [|D|, T ] is bounded the sequence (|D|T −\r
T |D|)ξn converges. Thus |D|Tξn converges, and as |D| is closed one gets that Tξ\r
is in the domain of |D|. Thus Dom|D| is invariant under T . Moreover one has\r
|D|Tξ = (|D|T − T |D|)ξ + T |D|ξ. \u0003\r
In other words, saying that both T and [|D|, T ] are bounded is equivalent, for\r
operators acting in H∞ to T ∈ Domδ and moreover δ(T ) is then the bounded\r
extension of |D|T − T |D|.\r
We introduce the following variant of δ, defined on operators T acting in H∞,\r
(209) δ1(T ) = [D2, T ](1 + D2)\r
−1/2\r
Lemma 13.2. Let T acting in H∞ be bounded.\r

δ\r
2\r

(δ(T )) are bounded for m = 1, 2.\r
But δ\r

(δ(T )) = δ(δ\r

Thus we obtain by induction that δ\r

Conversely, the boundedness of the δ\r

(T ). Indeed the\r
boundedness of the δ\r

(248) β(λ) = Tr(P(λ)|D|\r
−pT )\r
which is a non-decreasing step function of λ. The measure dβ is a positive linear\r
combination of Dirac masses, dβ =\r
Pαnδλn\r
. One has\r
dβ(λ) = Tr(dP(λ)|D|\r

since both have support in an interval [u0, ∞[ with u0 > 0, and gives the function\r
(250) (˜g ⋆ dβ)(u) = Zg(u\r

Thus, with h(ǫ) = ǫ\r

The convolution of the measures ˜g(u)d\r

Thus one has constants a and b such that for any u,\r
