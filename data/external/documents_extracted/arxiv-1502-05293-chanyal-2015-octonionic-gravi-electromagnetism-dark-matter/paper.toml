Abstract\r
An attempt has been made to analyse the the role of octonions in various unified field\r
theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split octonion al\u0002gebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation for\r
SU(2) × U(1) electroweak theory and SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) grand unified theory. De\u0002scribing the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces\r
(namely associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational\r
interaction (G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of oc\u0002tonionic split formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various\r
field equations for unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have recon\u0002structed the field equations of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is\r
shown that the difference between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion\r
hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because\r
the velocities of octonion hot dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales.\r
Key Words: octonions, split-octonions, monopole, dyons, non-Abelian gauge theories,\r

1 Introduction\r
According to celebrated Hurwitz theorem there exists [1] a set of four division algebra {R, C, H, O}\r
namely the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C), quaternions (H) [2, 3] and octonions (O)\r
[4, 5, 6]. All these four algebra’s are alternative with totally anti symmetric associators. Real\r
number explains well the classical Newtonian mechanics while the complex number plays an\r
important role for the explanation beyond the framework of quantum theory and relativity. Real\r
and complex numbers are limited only up to two dimensions while quaternions are extended to\r
four dimensions (one real and three imaginaries), on the other hand the octonions represent eight\r
dimensions (one real and seven imaginaries). Real and complex numbers are commutative and\r
1

associative. Quaternions are associative but not commutative while the octonions are neither\r
commutative and nor associative but alternative. Quaternions are well connected [7] with the\r
familiar SU(2) group and naturally unify [8, 9] electromagnetism and weak force responsible for\r
the electroweak SU(2) × U(1) sector of standard model. The octonion analysis has played an\r
important role in the context of various physical problems [10 -17] higher dimensional supersym\u0002metry, super gravity and super strings. Octonions are also [13 -15] used for unification program\r
of strong interaction with successful gauge theory of fundamental interactions. A theoretical de\u0002scription of the leptons and quark structure of hadrons has already been proposed by Günaydin\r
and Gursey [18] in the context of octonionic quantum mechanics in terms of octonionic Hilbert\r
space.\r
Rather, there has been continuing interests of many authors [19 -21] towards the develop\u0002ments of wave equation and octonion form of Maxwell’s equations. We [22 -31] have also discussed\r
the significance of octonions to develop generalized octonion electrodynamics, generalized split\r
octonion electrodynamics, octonion quantum chromodynamics, octonionic non-Abelian gauge\r
theory, octonion and conservation laws for dyons, octonion electrodynamics in isotropic and chi\u0002ral medium, octonion massive electrodynamics, octonionic representation of superstring theory,\r
octonion model of dark matter, octonion symmetric Dirac-Maxwell’s equations and obtained the\r
corresponding field equations and equation of motion in compact and consistence way. Keeping in\r
mind the recent update of theoretical physics, we have made to analyze the the role of octonions\r
in various unified field theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split\r
octonion algebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation\r
for SU(2)×U(1) electroweak theory and SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) grand unified theory. Describing\r
the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces (namely\r
associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational interaction\r
(G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of octonionic split\r
formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various field equations for\r
unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have reconstructed the field equa\u0002tions of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is shown that the difference\r
between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) is\r
significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because the velocities of octonion hot\r
dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales. As such, there exists more cold dark\r
matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic field equations.\r
2 The Split Octonion\r
An octonion O is expressed [22-29] as a real linear combination of the unit octonions (e0, e1, e2, e3,\r
e4, e5, e6, e7) as\r
O ≃ (O0, O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7) = O0e0 +\r
X\r
7\r
A=1\r
OAeA , (1)\r
where eA(A = 1, 2, ....., 7) are imaginary octonion units and e0 is the real octonion unit element.\r
The octet (e0, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7) is known as the octonion basis where eA satisfy the following\r
2

multiplication rules\r
e0 = 1, e2\r
A = −1, e0eA = eAe0 = eA,\r
eAeB = − δABe0 + fABC eC . (A, B, C = 1, 2, ......7) (2)\r
The structure constants fABC are completely antisymmetric and take the value 1, i.e.\r
fABC = +1 7−→ (ABC) ≡ (123), (471), (257), (165), (624), (543), (736). (3)\r
Therefore, we get the following relations among octonion basis elements as\r
[eA, eB] = 2fABCeC , {eA, eB} = −δABe0 , eA(eBeC) 6= (eAeB)eC , (4)\r
where δAB is the usual Kronecker delta-Dirac symbol.\r
Like wise, the split octonions [25, 26] are a non associative extension of split quaternions (asso\u0002ciative). Split octonions differ from the octonions in the signature of quadratic form. The split\r
octonion have a signature (4, 4) whereas the octonions have positive signature (8, 0). The Cayley\r
algebra of octonion over the field of complex number CC = C ⊗ C is visualized as the algebra of\r
split octonions with its following basis elements,\r
\r

The automorphism group of octonion is described [32, 33] as G2. Its subgroup which leaves\r
imaginary octonion unit e7 invariant (or equivalently the idempotents u0 and u\r
∗\r

) is SU(3). Here\r
the units uj and u\r
∗\r
j\r
(j = 1, 2, 3) transform respectively like a triplet and anti triplet respec\u0002tively associated with colour and anti colour triplets of SU(3) group. We may now introduce a\r
convenient realization for the basis elements (u0, uj , u∗\r
0\r
, u∗\r
j\r
) in term of Pauli’s spin matrices as\r

So, the split octonion algebra is now expressed in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrices components\r
of which are scalar and vector parts of a quaternion, i.e.\r
O =\r
( m ~p\r
~q n !\r
; m, n ∈ Sc(H); & ~p,~q ∈ V ec(H)\r
)\r
. (8)\r
As such, we write an arbitrary split octonion A ∈ O in terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector\r
matrix realization as\r
A = au∗\r
0 + bu0 + xiu\r
∗\r
i + yiui ≃\r
 \r
a −\r
−→x\r
−→y b !\r
, (9)\r
where a and b are scalars and ~x and ~y are three vectors. Thus the product of two octonions in\r
terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization is expressed as\r
 \r
a\r
−→x\r
−→y b ! c\r
−→u\r

 \r

!\r
, (10)\r
where (×) denotes the usual vector product, ej (j = 1, 2, 3) with ej ×ek = ǫjklel and ejek = −δjk.\r
Octonion conjugate of equation (9) in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization is now defined\r
as\r
A = au0 + bu⋆\r
0 − xiu\r
⋆\r
i − yiui ≃\r
 \r
b\r

−\r
−→y a !\r
. (11)\r
The norm of A is defined as\r
N(A) = AA = AA = (ab +\r
−→x .−→y )ˆ1 = n(A)ˆ1, (12)\r
where ˆ1 is the identity elements of matrix order 2 × 2, and the expression n(A) = (ab +\r
−→x .−→y )\r
defines the quadratic form which admits the composition as\r
n(A~ · B~ ) = n(A~) n(B~ ), (∀ A, ~ B~ ∈ O) (13)\r
Thus, we may easily express the Euclidean or Minkowski four vector in split octonion formulation\r

in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realizations. Consequently, any four-vector Aµ (complex\r
or real) can equivalently be written in terms of the following Zorn matrix realization as\r

3 Octonionic electroweak formulation\r
In order to discuss the role of split octonion in particle physics, we describe the U(1) × SU(2)\r
electroweak gauge formulation in terms of the split octonion representation. Thus, we may write\r
an octonion as the combination of two gauge fields (i.e. Aµ and Bµ are respectively associated\r
with electric and magnetic charges) expanded in terms of quaternions, i.e.\r

4 Octonionic formulation of Grand Unified Theory\r
Keeping in mind the role of octonion in gauge field theories, let us start with the local SU(3) ×\r
SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry which is an internal symmetry representing the Standard Model\r
(SM). The smallest simple Lie group which contains the standard model, and upon which the\r
first Grand Unified Theory (GUT) was based, is SU(5) ⊃ SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1). Thus we\r
may extend SU(2) × U(1) electroweak gauge theory to the SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) gauge theory\r
(GUT) in terms of split octonion formulation. We may now write the SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)\r
gauge field for generalized fields of dyons as\r

Here we assume the octonion eight dimensional space, combination of two quaternionic spaces\r
respectively associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational\r
interaction (G-space) [35, 36, 37]. Thus, we may write the split octonionic unified representation\r
of gravitational-electromagnetic (G-EM) space in terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix\r
realization as\r

J(em−g)/(g−em) = Q(em−g)/(g−em) V(em−g)/(g−em), (67)\r
Jg−g = Q(g−g)V(g−g), J(em−em) = Q(em−em)V(em−em),\r
where Q(g−g), Q(em−g), Q(g−em) and Q(em−g)/(g−em), Qem−em)/(g−g)respectively denote the mass\r
of the gravitational- gravitational (G-G), electromagnetic- gravitational (EM-G), gravitational\u0002electromagnetic (G-EM) interactions etc., while Q(em−em)\r
represent the charge of the electromagnetic\u0002electromagnetic (EM-EM) interaction. Thus Q(g−g)\r

and Q(em−em)respectively describe the generalized mass and generalized charge [30, 35, 36, 37]of\r

6 Octonion Dark Matter (ODM)\r
Dark matter [38, 39] is a type of matter hypothesized to account for a large part of the total\r
mass in the universe. Only about 4.6% of the mass-energy of the universe is ordinary matter,\r
about 23% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 72% is thought to consist\r
of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed almost uniformly in space and with\r
energy density non-evolving or slowly evolving with time. On the other hand, the nonbaryonic\r
form of octonionic dark matter [38, 39] is evident through its gravitational effect only.\r
However, form experiment point of views the summary of the current measurements of the\r
matter density Ωmatter, the dark matter density ΩDM and the energy density Ωenergy is already\r
given by Hagiwara [41]. Each are in units of the critical density ρcritical ≃ 3h\r
2/(8πG), where G\r
is the Newton’s gravitational constant, and h is the present value of the Hubble constant. The\r
experimental results [42, 43] require the best current values of the matter and energy densities\r
respectively given as Ωmatter ≃ 0.27 and Ωenergy ≃ 0.73. The measurements describe the baryon\r
density Ωbaryon to a value less than ∼ 0.03. The difference Ωmatter − Ωbaryon ≃ 0.24 must be in\r
the form of non-baryonic dark matter. Some experimental results for energy, matter and dark\r
matter densities [44, 45] are shown in Table-2.\r
14

0.49 ≤ Ωenergy ≤ 0.74 0.49 ≤ Ωenergy ≤ 0.76\r

2Ωbaryon ≤ 0.03 0.01 ≤ h2Ωbaryon ≤ 0.03\r
Table 2: The experimental results for Matter and Dark Matter densities with the compression\r
of first release data and newest data.\r
The ranges of density parameters within the standard cosmological model derived from the\r
first release data with corresponding values newest data and h ≃ 0.74 ± 0.08 is the Hubble\r
parameter [44, 45]. Thus, the matter density:\r
Ωmatter ≃ Ωbaryon + ΩHot−dark−matter + ΩCold−dark−matter\r
≃ Ωbaryon + ΩDM , (68)\r
includes both baryonic matter and dark matter. Moreover the dark matter can be classed either\r
as hot or cold depending on whether it was relativistic or not in the early universe. So, we can\r
analyse the hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. We assume that the total\r
octonionic dark matter density (ODM) is described as\r
ΩO−DM ≃ ΩO−HDM + ΩO−CDM , (69)\r
where ΩO−HDM describes the octonionic hot dark matter density (OHDM) while ΩO−CDM\r
describes the octonionic cold dark matter density (OCDM).\r
7 Octonion Hot and Cold Dark matter\r
Let us assumed that the octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) describes the particles that have\r
zero or near-zero masses. Thus we assume that the octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) is\r
associated with the gravitational-gravitational (G-G), electromagnetic-electromagnetic (EM-EM)\r
and the combination of (G-G) and (EM-EM) fields [30, 35, 36, 37] interactions. So, the hot dark\r
matter may then be described in terms of following 2×2 Zorn vector matrix realization of split\r
octonions, i.e.\r
FO−HDM =\r

where FO−HDM is an octonionic field strength represents the hot dark matter. So, the compo\u0002nents of equation (70) are given as\r
\r

\r
Fk\r

Here the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) represents the quantas of EM-EM interactions\r
(namely photons) and G-G interactions (i.e. gravitons). Similarly, the required current source\r
density for octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) is expressed by the following split octonion form\r
as,\r

which represent the non-baryonic octonion hot dark matter current source density JO−HDM\r
associated with massless photons, gravitons, etc. Thus the current source equations for octonionic\r
hot dark matter (OHDM) are given below:\r
\r

Rather, the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) can be described as the composition of the\r
massive objects moving at sub-relativistic velocities. So, the difference between the octonion\r
cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonions hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the\r
formulation of structure, because the velocities of octonions hot dark matter cause it to wipe\r
out structure on small scales. Thus, the octonions cold dark matter is associated with the\r
electromagnetic-gravitational (EM-G), gravitational-electromagnetic (G-EM) and their mixed\r
interactions. Thus, we analyse the octonion cold dark matter for massive particles, responsible\r
for EM-G and G-EM interactions, i.e.\r
FO−CDM =\r

So, the quantum equations for octonionic hot and cold dark matter may easily be expressed in the\r
terms of simpler and compact notation of octonions representations. From the foregoing analysis\r
we find the matter density of octonionic cold dark matter (OCDM) i.e. 0.10 ≤ h\r
2ΩCDM ≤ 0.32\u0001\r
is grater than that of octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) as 0.00 ≤ h\r
2ΩHDM ≤ 0.12\u0001\r
. As such,\r
there exists more cold dark matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic\r
field equations.\r

Abstract\r
An attempt has been made to analyse the the role of octonions in various unified field\r
theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split octonion al\u0002gebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation for\r
SU(2) × U(1) electroweak theory and SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) grand unified theory. De\u0002scribing the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces\r
(namely associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational\r
interaction (G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of oc\u0002tonionic split formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various\r
field equations for unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have recon\u0002structed the field equations of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is\r
shown that the difference between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion\r
hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because\r
the velocities of octonion hot dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales.\r

According to celebrated Hurwitz theorem there exists [1] a set of four division algebra {R, C, H, O}\r
namely the real numbers (R), complex numbers (C), quaternions (H) [2, 3] and octonions (O)\r
[4, 5, 6]. All these four algebra’s are alternative with totally anti symmetric associators. Real\r
number explains well the classical Newtonian mechanics while the complex number plays an\r
important role for the explanation beyond the framework of quantum theory and relativity. Real\r
and complex numbers are limited only up to two dimensions while quaternions are extended to\r
four dimensions (one real and three imaginaries), on the other hand the octonions represent eight\r
dimensions (one real and seven imaginaries). Real and complex numbers are commutative and\r
1

associative. Quaternions are associative but not commutative while the octonions are neither\r
commutative and nor associative but alternative. Quaternions are well connected [7] with the\r
familiar SU(2) group and naturally unify [8, 9] electromagnetism and weak force responsible for\r
the electroweak SU(2) × U(1) sector of standard model. The octonion analysis has played an\r
important role in the context of various physical problems [10 -17] higher dimensional supersym\u0002metry, super gravity and super strings. Octonions are also [13 -15] used for unification program\r
of strong interaction with successful gauge theory of fundamental interactions. A theoretical de\u0002scription of the leptons and quark structure of hadrons has already been proposed by Günaydin\r
and Gursey [18] in the context of octonionic quantum mechanics in terms of octonionic Hilbert\r
space.\r
Rather, there has been continuing interests of many authors [19 -21] towards the develop\u0002ments of wave equation and octonion form of Maxwell’s equations. We [22 -31] have also discussed\r
the significance of octonions to develop generalized octonion electrodynamics, generalized split\r
octonion electrodynamics, octonion quantum chromodynamics, octonionic non-Abelian gauge\r
theory, octonion and conservation laws for dyons, octonion electrodynamics in isotropic and chi\u0002ral medium, octonion massive electrodynamics, octonionic representation of superstring theory,\r
octonion model of dark matter, octonion symmetric Dirac-Maxwell’s equations and obtained the\r
corresponding field equations and equation of motion in compact and consistence way. Keeping in\r
mind the recent update of theoretical physics, we have made to analyze the the role of octonions\r
in various unified field theories associated with dyons and the dark matter. Starting with the split\r
octonion algebra and its properties, we have discussed the octonionic unified gauge formulation\r
for SU(2)×U(1) electroweak theory and SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) grand unified theory. Describing\r
the octonion eight dimensional space as the combination of two quaternionic spaces (namely\r
associated with the electromagnetic interaction (EM-space) and linear gravitational interaction\r
(G-space)), we have reexamined the unified picture of EM-G space in terms of octonionic split\r
formulation in consistent manner. Consequently, we have obtained the various field equations for\r
unified gravi-electromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, we have reconstructed the field equa\u0002tions of hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. It is shown that the difference\r
between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonion hot dark matter (OHDM) is\r
significant in the formulating of structure of these two, because the velocities of octonion hot\r
dark matter cause it to wipe out structure on small scales. As such, there exists more cold dark\r
matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic field equations."""

So, the split octonion algebra is now expressed in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrices components\r
of which are scalar and vector parts of a quaternion, i.e.\r
O =\r
( m ~p\r
~q n !\r
; m, n ∈ Sc(H); & ~p,~q ∈ V ec(H)\r
)\r
. (8)\r
As such, we write an arbitrary split octonion A ∈ O in terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector\r
matrix realization as\r
A = au∗\r

i + yiui ≃\r
 \r
a −\r

−→y b !\r
, (9)\r
where a and b are scalars and ~x and ~y are three vectors. Thus the product of two octonions in\r
terms of following 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization is expressed as\r
 \r

where (×) denotes the usual vector product, ej (j = 1, 2, 3) with ej ×ek = ǫjklel and ejek = −δjk.\r
Octonion conjugate of equation (9) in terms of 2×2 Zorn’s vector matrix realization is now defined\r
as\r
A = au0 + bu⋆\r
0 − xiu\r
⋆\r
i − yiui ≃\r

The norm of A is defined as\r
N(A) = AA = AA = (ab +\r
−→x .−→y )ˆ1 = n(A)ˆ1, (12)\r
where ˆ1 is the identity elements of matrix order 2 × 2, and the expression n(A) = (ab +\r
−→x .−→y )\r
defines the quadratic form which admits the composition as\r
n(A~ · B~ ) = n(A~) n(B~ ), (∀ A, ~ B~ ∈ O) (13)\r
Thus, we may easily express the Euclidean or Minkowski four vector in split octonion formulation\r

Dark matter [38, 39] is a type of matter hypothesized to account for a large part of the total\r
mass in the universe. Only about 4.6% of the mass-energy of the universe is ordinary matter,\r
about 23% is thought to be composed of dark matter. The remaining 72% is thought to consist\r
of dark energy, an even stranger component, distributed almost uniformly in space and with\r
energy density non-evolving or slowly evolving with time. On the other hand, the nonbaryonic\r
form of octonionic dark matter [38, 39] is evident through its gravitational effect only.\r
However, form experiment point of views the summary of the current measurements of the\r
matter density Ωmatter, the dark matter density ΩDM and the energy density Ωenergy is already\r
given by Hagiwara [41]. Each are in units of the critical density ρcritical ≃ 3h\r
2/(8πG), where G\r
is the Newton’s gravitational constant, and h is the present value of the Hubble constant. The\r
experimental results [42, 43] require the best current values of the matter and energy densities\r
respectively given as Ωmatter ≃ 0.27 and Ωenergy ≃ 0.73. The measurements describe the baryon\r
density Ωbaryon to a value less than ∼ 0.03. The difference Ωmatter − Ωbaryon ≃ 0.24 must be in\r
the form of non-baryonic dark matter. Some experimental results for energy, matter and dark\r
matter densities [44, 45] are shown in Table-2.\r

includes both baryonic matter and dark matter. Moreover the dark matter can be classed either\r
as hot or cold depending on whether it was relativistic or not in the early universe. So, we can\r
analyse the hot and cold dark matter in terms of split octonions. We assume that the total\r
octonionic dark matter density (ODM) is described as\r
ΩO−DM ≃ ΩO−HDM + ΩO−CDM , (69)\r

Rather, the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) can be described as the composition of the\r
massive objects moving at sub-relativistic velocities. So, the difference between the octonion\r
cold dark matter (OCDM) and the octonions hot dark matter (OHDM) is significant in the\r
formulation of structure, because the velocities of octonions hot dark matter cause it to wipe\r
out structure on small scales. Thus, the octonions cold dark matter is associated with the\r
electromagnetic-gravitational (EM-G), gravitational-electromagnetic (G-EM) and their mixed\r

So, the quantum equations for octonionic hot and cold dark matter may easily be expressed in the\r
terms of simpler and compact notation of octonions representations. From the foregoing analysis\r
we find the matter density of octonionic cold dark matter (OCDM) i.e. 0.10 ≤ h\r
2ΩCDM ≤ 0.32\u0001\r
is grater than that of octonionic hot dark matter (OHDM) as 0.00 ≤ h\r
2ΩHDM ≤ 0.12\u0001\r
. As such,\r
there exists more cold dark matter than that of hot dark matter in nature supported by octonionic\r
