We show that the theory of operator quantum error correction can be naturally generalized by\r
allowing constraints not only on states but also on observables. The resulting theory describes\r
the correction of algebras of observables (and may therefore suitably be called “operator algebra\r
quantum error correction”). In particular, the approach provides a framework for the correction of\r
hybrid quantum-classical information and it does not require the state to be entirely in one of the\r
corresponding subspaces or subsystems. We discuss applications to quantum teleportation and to\r
the study of information flows in quantum interactions.\r
Error correction methods are of crucial importance for\r
quantum computing and the so far most general frame\u0002work, called operator quantum error correction (OQEC)\r
[1, 2], encompasses active error correction [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\r
(QEC), together with the concepts of decoherence-free\r
and noiseless subspaces and subsystems [9, 10, 11, 12,\r
13, 14, 15]. The OQEC approach has enabled more ef\u0002ficient correction procedures in active error correction\r
[16, 17, 18, 19], has led to improved threshold results\r
in fault tolerant quantum computing [20], and has moti\u0002vated the development of a structure theory for passive\r
error correction [21, 22] which has recently been used in\r
quantum gravity [23, 24, 25, 26].\r
In this paper, we introduce a natural generalization of\r
this theory. To this end, we change the focus from that of\r
states to that of observables: conservation of a state by\r
a given noise model implies the conservation of all of its\r
observables, and is therefore a rather strong requirement.\r
This can be alleviated by specifically selecting only some\r
observables to be conserved. In this context it is natu\u0002ral to consider algebras of observables [27]. Hence our\r
codes take the form of operator algebras that are closed\r
under Hermitian conjugation; that is, finite dimensional C∗\r
-algebras [28]. As a convenience, we shall simply refer\r
to such operator algebras as “algebras”. Correspondingly\r
we refer to the new theory as “operator algebra quantum\r
error correction” (OAQEC). We present results that es\u0002tablish testable conditions for correctability in OAQEC.\r
We also discuss illustrative examples and consider appli\u0002cations to quantum teleportation and information flow in\r
quantum interactions. We shall present the proofs and\r
more examples in [29].\r
Noise models in quantum information are described by\r
channels, which are (in the Schr¨odinger picture) trace\u0002preserving (TP) and completely positive (CP) linear\r
mapsE on mixed states,ρ, which are operators acting\r
on a Hilbert spaceH. Ifρ is a density matrix we can\r
always writeρ 7→ E(ρ) =\r
P\r
a\r
E\r
aρE\r
†a where\r
{E\r
a\r
} is a\r
non-unique family of channel elements. The QEC frame\u0002work addresses the question of whether a given subspace\r
of statesPH, called the code, can be corrected in the\r
sense that there exists a correction channelR such that\r
R(E(ρ)) =ρ for all statesρ in the subspace; that is, all\r
ρ which satisfyρ= PρP. This amounts to asking for a\r
subspace on whichE has a left inverse that is a physical\r
map. From QEC to OQEC the scope of error correction\r
is generalized by only requiring the states of a subsys\u0002tem to be conserved: R(E(ρ ⊗ τ)) = ρ ⊗ τ′\r
for allρ⊗τ\r
in the subspace. As we will show, this amounts to the\r
correction of special types of algebras. In general, every\r
algebraA of observables induces a decomposition of the\r
Hilbert spaceH intoH=⊕\r
dk=1\r
(A\r
k\r
⊗B\r
k\r
)⊕C. Here\r
all operators in the algebra haveC in their kernel and\r
act irreducibly on eachA\r
k while acting trivially on the\r
subsystemB\r
k. This means that the algebra decomposes\r
as\r
A=⊕\r
dk=1\r
(L(A\r
k\r
)⊗1\r
B\r
k\r
)⊕0\r
C\r
, (1)\r
whereL(A\r
k) denotes the set of all operators on\r
A\r
k\r
,1\r
B\r
k\r
is the identity operator onB\r
k, and 0C is the zero opera\u0002tor on C. From this perspective, we can view the QEC\r
framework as focussing on codesL(A)⊗1\r
B (or subspaces\r
A) with dimB = 1. Moreover, OQEC considers “subsys\u0002tem codes” encoded in algebras of the form L(A) ⊗ 1B\r
for general subsystemsA andB. Classical information is\r
captured by the case in which dimA = 1: commutative\r
algebras. Thus, in addition to the classical, QEC, and\r
OQEC cases, our new OAQEC approach also provides a\r
framework for the correction of hybrid quantum-classical\r
information and memory [30] exposed to external noise.\r
In particular, this includes cases in which separate (or\u0002thogonal) parcels of quantum information are labelled by\r
classical “addresses”.\r
Let us discuss in more detail the motivation for consid\u0002ering algebras. We begin by recalling that a general ob\u0002servable is a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) X(∆) where ∆ ⊂ Ω, the set in which the observable X\r
takes values. For simplicity we consider observables with\r
a finite number of outcomes which can be characterized\r
by a family of positive operators{X\r
a\r
}. In the Heisen\u0002berg picture an observable evolves according to the unital\r
CP-mapE\r
† with elements\r
E\r
†a\r
instead ofE\r
a. If for all val-

2\r
ues of the label a there exists an operator Ya such that\r
Xa = E\r
†\r
(Ya) then all the statistical information about X\r
has been conserved by E since for any initial state ρ we\r
have, Tr(ρXa) = Tr(ρE\r
†\r
(Ya)) = Tr(E(ρ)Ya), the latter\r
equality following from the definition of E\r
†\r
. In this case,\r
to correct for the errors induced by E we need a channel\r
R that maps each Xa to one of the operators Ya through\r
R†(Xa) = Ya, so that (R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(Xa) = (E\r
† ◦ R†\r
)(Xa) =\r
Xa. In such a scenario, we will say that Xa is correctable\r
for E and conserved by R ◦ E. In particular, if X is\r
a standard projective measurement, and so X2\r
a = Xa\r
for all a, then the projectors Xa linearly span the alge\u0002bra they generate. Hence, in this case R ◦ E conserves\r
an entire commutative algebra. Therefore, focussing on\r
the correctability of sets of observables which have the\r
structure of an algebra, apart from allowing a complete\r
characterization, is also sufficient for the study of all the\r
correctable projective observables.\r
One result of this paper will be to show that there al\u0002ways exists a single channel R correcting all projective\r
observables correctable in the above sense. In fact, we\r
study a more general question: If we have some con\u0002trol on the initial states, which is expected in a quantum\r
computation, then we can ask for an observable to be\r
conserved only if the state starts in a certain subspace\r
P H. That is, P(E\r
† ◦ R†\r
)(X)P = PXP. We derive a\r
necessary and sufficient condition for an entire algebra of\r
operators on P H to be simultaneously correctable in that\r
sense. The resulting theory contains OQEC and QEC in\r
the special cases discussed above.\r
We remark that our approach differs from that of the\r
stabilizer formalism [8] where observables in the Heisen\u0002berg picture are used as a way to characterize a subspace\r
of states. Our approach is closer in spirit to that of [31].\r
The idea that observables naturally characterize subsys\u0002tems has also been exploited in [32].\r
Noiseless subsystems — First we recall the definition\r
of a noiseless subsystem and we give an equivalent def\u0002inition in terms of the dual channel E\r
†\r
. Consider a de\u0002composition of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space H as\r
H = (A ⊗ B) ⊕ C. We introduce the projector P on the\r
subspace A ⊗ B. By definition, A is a noiseless subsys\u0002tem for E if for all ρ ∈ L(A) and σ ∈ L(B) there exists\r
τ ∈ L(B) such that E(ρ ⊗ σ) = ρ ⊗ τ. In terms of the\r
dual channel E\r
†\r
, the subsystem A is noiseless for E if and\r
only if\r
P E\r
†\r
(X ⊗ 1) P = X ⊗ 1 (2)\r
for all operators X acting on A. This is a consequence\r
of the noiseless subsystem characterization from [1] as\r
can be readily verified. In Eq. (2), the projectors P are\r
needed since the definition of the noiseless subsystem is\r
only concerned with what happens to states initially in\r
the subspace A⊗B. In general, an initial component out\u0002side this space may, after evolution, disturb the otherwise\r
noiseless observables.\r
Conserved observables — If PE\r
†\r
(Xa)P = PXaP for\r
all a we say that the observable X is conserved by E for\r
states in P H. More generally, let us say an algebra A is\r
conserved by E for states in P H if every element of A is\r
conserved; that is,\r
P E\r
†\r
(X) P = PXP ∀X ∈ A. (3)\r
Notice that Eq. (3) gives a generalization of noiseless\r
subsystems. Indeed, any subalgebra A of L(P H) for\r
which all elements X ∈ A satisfy Eq. (3) is a direct sum\r
of noiseless subsystems. This can be seen by first not\u0002ing that any algebra A has a decomposition of the form\r
given in Eq. (1), and then applying Eq. (2). In particular,\r
focussing on the so-called “simple” algebras L(A) ⊗ 1\r
B\r
captures standard noiseless subsystems as in Eq. (2).\r
The following theorem provides testable conditions\r
that characterize when an algebra is conserved on states\r
in a given subspace by a channel, strictly in terms of the\r
operation elements for the channel. The result comes as\r
an adaptation of results from [21] and we shall present\r
its proof in [29]. It is a generalization because, here, the\r
algebra need not contain the projector P.\r
Theorem 1. A subalgebra A of L(P H) is conserved on\r
states in P H by a channel E if and only if [EaP, X] = 0\r
for all elements Ea and all X ∈ A.\r
Heuristically, an algebra supported on a subspace is\r
conserved by a channel precisely when elements of the\r
algebra commute with the generators of the noise, re\u0002stricted to the subspace.\r
Error correction of observables — We say that an al\u0002gebra A is correctable for E on states in the subspace P H\r
if there exists a channel R such that\r
P(R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(X)P = PXP ∀X ∈ A. (4)\r
This notion of correctability is more general than the one\r
addressed by the framework of OQEC. Indeed, OQEC fo\u0002cusses on simple algebras, L(A)⊗1\r
B. Here, correctability\r
is defined for any finite-dimensional algebra. A further\r
generalization is that we do not require P to belong to\r
the algebra considered. We expand on these points in\r
[29] via an examination of the Schr¨odinger formulation\r
of OAQEC.\r
We now state the main result of the paper, which gen\u0002eralizes the fundamental result for both QEC [5] and\r
OQEC [1, 18]. It provides conditions for testing whether\r
an algebra is correctable for a given channel in terms of\r
its operation elements.\r
Theorem 2. A subalgebra A of B(P H) is correctable on\r
P H for the channel E if and only if\r
[PE†\r
cEbP, X] = 0 ∀X ∈ A ∀c, b. (5)\r
We present the proof in [29]. Not surprisingly, the\r
operation elements {E†\r
cEb} for E\r
† ◦ E play a key role as

3\r
in other error correction settings. We also note that the\r
correction channel R constructed in the proof corrects\r
any channel whose elements are linear combinations of\r
the elements Ea. Thus, as in the original theory of error\r
correction, we can in practice neglect the channel E and\r
focus instead directly on the discrete error operators Ea.\r
It is instructive to consider the special case of clas\u0002sical OAQEC codes. A classical channel has elements\r
Eij =\r
√pij |iihj|, where (pij ) forms a stochastic matrix\r
with transitional probabilities pij from j to i. Thus,\r
E\r
†\r
ijEkl = δik√pijpil|jihl|, and Theorem 2 shows that if\r
α = (αj ) are the diagonal components of a classical (di\u0002agonal) observable, then α can be corrected if and only\r
if αj = αk for all k, j such that there is an i with pij 6= 0\r
and pik 6= 0. Heuristically, two states cannot be distin\u0002guished from each other after the channel has acted pre\u0002cisely when there is a nonzero probability of a transition\r
from both states to a common state.\r
Does OAQEC offer more powerful error correction pro\u0002cedures than OQEC? It is easy to see that if an algebra\r
A is correctable according to this scheme then each sim\u0002ple sector L(A) ⊗ 1\r
B is individually correctable through\r
OQEC (or QEC when dim B = 1). However, OAQEC\r
codes have at least two attractive features: First, all\r
simple sectors can be corrected simultaneously by the\r
same correction channel. Secondly, each simple sector\r
can be corrected even if the initial state is not entirely\r
in the corresponding subspace. In particular, the initial\r
state could be in a quantum superposition between var\u0002ious sectors even though combined sectors may not be\r
correctable in the traditional sense.\r
As an illustrative example, consider a 2-qubit sys\u0002tem exposed to noise inducing a phase flip error Z\r
(a unitary Pauli operator) on the first qubit with\r
nonzero probability p. The noise model E has elements\r
{\r
√\r
1 − p 1,\r
√\r
p Z1}. Let C1 be the (subspace) code with\r
basis |0Li = |00i, |1Li = |01i and C2 the code with basis\r
|0Li = |10i, |1Li = |11i. It is clear that each of C1 and\r
C2, or from the OAQEC perspective the algebras L(C1)\r
and L(C2), is correctable individually for E. Indeed, each\r
code is a stabilizer subspace for Z1 (for eigenvalue 1 and\r
−1 respectively). However, the combined code C1 ⊕ C2,\r
or equivalently L(C1 ⊕ C2) = L(C\r
4\r
), is clearly not cor\u0002rectable for E because E is not a unitary operation.\r
Nevertheless, the hybrid qubit-qubit OAQEC code\r
A = L(C1) ⊕ L(C2) is correctable for E. This immedi\u0002ately follows from Theorem 2 and the observation that\r
Z1 belongs to the set of operators which commute with\r
A: the commutant A′ = CP1 ⊕ CP2, where we have\r
written Pi for the projector onto Ci. As discussed above,\r
separate (orthogonal) codes that determine the simple\r
summands of an OAQEC code can all be corrected by\r
the same correction operation, which is clearly not the\r
case in general for non-OAQEC codes. Moreover, as in\r
QEC and OQEC, the theory includes an explicit recipe\r
for constructing the correction operation. This point will\r
be elucidated further in [29]. In this case one can eas\u0002ily verify that the channel R with elements {P1, Z1P2}\r
satisfies (R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(X) = X for all X ∈ A.\r
Application: noisy quantum teleportation — In the\r
standard picture for quantum teleportation [33], Alice\r
can send Bob an entire qubit by sending two classical\r
bits, provided they share a maximally entangled pair\r
of qubits initially. Consider a pair of qubits in the\r
maximally entangled state |ψi = √\r
1\r
2\r
(|00i + |11i). We\r
assume that Alice and Bob each possess one qubit of\r
this pair. Consider also the unitary Pauli operators\r
{U0 = 1, U1 = X, U2 = Y, U3 = Z}. In the language\r
of channels, teleportation can be viewed as the channel\r
E that has for input the qubit |ψi to be teleported and\r
for output three qubits: two which represent the bits Al\u0002ice needs to send to Bob, and Bob’s qubit: E(|ψihψ|) =\r
1\r
4\r
P3\r
i=0 |iihi| ⊗ Ui(|ψihψ|)U\r
†\r
i\r
,where |ii form an orthonor\u0002mal basis of the four-dimensional Hilbert space represent\u0002ing the two bits that Alice must send to Bob over a clas\u0002sical channel. We can readily verify that Bob can indeed\r
fully correct the channel. The channel elements are of the\r
form Ei ∝ |ii⊗Ui, and hence the condition of Theorem 2\r
is met since E\r
†\r
i Ej ∝ hi||ji⊗U\r
†\r
i Uj = δijU\r
†\r
i Ui = δij1. Thus\r
all operators on the initial qubit can be corrected, and all\r
the information can be recovered. Note that even though\r
the operators Ei map between two different spaces, the\r
operators E\r
†\r
i Ej map the initial qubit space to itself. One\r
can teleport as many qubits as desired in parallel pro\u0002vided that one starts with one shared entangled pair per\r
qubit to be teleported.\r
Consider now the case in which the classical step of\r
the teleportation process, when Alice transmits bits to\r
Bob, is implemented over a noisy classical channel. We\r
shall also assume unitary encodings are taken from more\r
general families of unitary operators. To this end, con\u0002sider a family {Ug}g∈S of unitary operators in L(H) for\r
some Hilbert space H. In the standard teleportation pro\u0002tocol, S is the set of single qubit Pauli operators. Now\r
suppose that a noisy stochastic channel is applied on the\r
classical bits |gi, g ∈ S, that Alice must send to Bob\r
with transition probabilities pgh. Then one could ask,\r
what information can be recovered by Bob once he is in\r
possession of all the data? The overall channel is given\r
by composing E with the classical channel. Thus, the\r
error operators Fghl satisfy Fghl ∝\r
√pgh|gihh||li ⊗ Ul =\r
δhl√pgh|gi ⊗ Uh. It follows that the commutant of the\r
correctable algebra, which is contained in L(H), has gen\u0002erators F\r
†\r
ghlFg\r
′h′\r
l\r
′ = δgg′\r
√pghpgh′U\r
†\r
hUh′ . We are only\r
interested in the nonzero generators; that is, those for\r
which pgh 6= 0 and pgh′ 6= 0. This condition means that\r
classically, because of the noise, we can no longer distin\u0002guish between the state |hi and the state |h\r
′\r
i. Therefore,\r
the commutant of the conserved algebra has a generator\r
U\r
†\r
gUh for each pair of classical states g, h that became\r
indistinguishable under the noisy channel. In short, if

4\r
Bob is not sure whether Alice’s classical message was g\r
or h, then he can only completely recover those proper\u0002ties of the quantum states that are invariant under the\r
transformations U\r
†\r
gUh. In particular, this implies more\r
general code algebras will be obtained. We shall further\r
investigate this “noisy” version of quantum teleportation\r
in [29].\r
Application: information flow in interactions — Con\u0002sider the interaction U between a system S and an\r
apparatus A where the initial state of the apparatus\r
is known to be ρA. Tracing out either over A or\r
S after the evolution yields respectively the channel\r
ESS(ρS) = TrA(U(ρS ⊗ρA)U\r
†\r
) from S to S or ESA(ρS) =\r
TrS(U(ρS ⊗ ρA)U\r
†\r
) from S to A.\r
Using OAQEC we can determine what observables of\r
the system can be corrected for either of the two chan\u0002nels. The algebra ASA preserved by ESA, that represents\r
the information about S which is transferred to A, can be\r
computed to be the largest algebra of operators commut\u0002ing with the range of E\r
†\r
SS. Hence a direct consequence of\r
Theorem 2 is that in an open dynamics defined by a chan\u0002nel E, full information about a projective observable can\r
escape the system if and only if it commutes with all the\r
operators in the range of the channel; that is, those ob\u0002servables whose first moment is correctable for E. This is\r
a generalization of work in [34]. Furthermore this method\r
characterizes those observables which are effectively du\u0002plicated; in other words, those whose information stayed\r
in S and also flowed to A. They form the commutative\r
algebra ASS ∩ ASA. Those observables have been non\u0002destructively measured by the system A. This analysis\r
has implications for the theory of decoherence [35, 36]: a\r
unique commutative algebra of observables emerges nat\u0002urally as characterizing the information which is shared\r
between the system and the environment after an inter\u0002action. This suggests that the pointer observables should\r
be defined not just by their property of being stably en\u0002coded in the system but also by the requirement that the\r
information they represent is transmitted to the environ\u0002ment. In this sense there is no basis ambiguity [37] for the\r
interpretation of a unitary interaction as a measurement\r
of the system by the apparatus.\r
Outlook — We have presented a generalization of the\r
theory of operator quantum error correction that allows\r
for the correction of an arbitrary algebra of operators.\r
Our main result gives a characterization of correctable\r
codes in this scheme. Proofs and more applications will\r
be provided in [29]. The recent experience with opera\u0002tor quantum error correction suggests a reinvestigation\r
of codes that have appeared in the literature for pos\u0002sibly improved efficiency or other applications enabled\r
by this approach. We also suggest that the applications\r
to quantum teleportation and information flow presented\r
here warrant further investigation. Furthermore, we have\r
here focussed on algebras of operators rather than gen\u0002eral operator subspaces. It should be most interesting\r
to consider the possible conservation of the statistics of\r
general POVMs.\r

We show that the theory of operator quantum error correction can be naturally generalized by\r
allowing constraints not only on states but also on observables. The resulting theory describes\r
the correction of algebras of observables (and may therefore suitably be called “operator algebra\r
quantum error correction”). In particular, the approach provides a framework for the correction of\r
hybrid quantum-classical information and it does not require the state to be entirely in one of the\r
corresponding subspaces or subsystems. We discuss applications to quantum teleportation and to\r
the study of information flows in quantum interactions.\r
Error correction methods are of crucial importance for\r
quantum computing and the so far most general frame\u0002work, called operator quantum error correction (OQEC)\r
[1, 2], encompasses active error correction [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\r
(QEC), together with the concepts of decoherence-free\r
and noiseless subspaces and subsystems [9, 10, 11, 12,\r
13, 14, 15]. The OQEC approach has enabled more ef\u0002ficient correction procedures in active error correction\r
[16, 17, 18, 19], has led to improved threshold results\r
in fault tolerant quantum computing [20], and has moti\u0002vated the development of a structure theory for passive\r
error correction [21, 22] which has recently been used in\r
quantum gravity [23, 24, 25, 26].\r
In this paper, we introduce a natural generalization of\r
this theory. To this end, we change the focus from that of\r
states to that of observables: conservation of a state by\r
a given noise model implies the conservation of all of its\r
observables, and is therefore a rather strong requirement.\r
This can be alleviated by specifically selecting only some\r
observables to be conserved. In this context it is natu\u0002ral to consider algebras of observables [27]. Hence our\r
codes take the form of operator algebras that are closed\r
under Hermitian conjugation; that is, finite dimensional C∗\r
-algebras [28]. As a convenience, we shall simply refer\r
to such operator algebras as “algebras”. Correspondingly\r
we refer to the new theory as “operator algebra quantum\r
error correction” (OAQEC). We present results that es\u0002tablish testable conditions for correctability in OAQEC.\r
We also discuss illustrative examples and consider appli\u0002cations to quantum teleportation and information flow in\r
quantum interactions. We shall present the proofs and\r
more examples in [29].\r
Noise models in quantum information are described by\r
channels, which are (in the Schr¨odinger picture) trace\u0002preserving (TP) and completely positive (CP) linear\r
mapsE on mixed states,ρ, which are operators acting\r
on a Hilbert spaceH. Ifρ is a density matrix we can\r
always writeρ 7→ E(ρ) =\r
P\r
a\r
E\r
aρE\r
†a where\r
{E\r
a\r
} is a\r
non-unique family of channel elements. The QEC frame\u0002work addresses the question of whether a given subspace\r
of statesPH, called the code, can be corrected in the\r
sense that there exists a correction channelR such that\r
R(E(ρ)) =ρ for all statesρ in the subspace; that is, all\r
ρ which satisfyρ= PρP. This amounts to asking for a\r
subspace on whichE has a left inverse that is a physical\r
map. From QEC to OQEC the scope of error correction\r
is generalized by only requiring the states of a subsys\u0002tem to be conserved: R(E(ρ ⊗ τ)) = ρ ⊗ τ′\r
for allρ⊗τ\r
in the subspace. As we will show, this amounts to the\r
correction of special types of algebras. In general, every\r
algebraA of observables induces a decomposition of the\r
Hilbert spaceH intoH=⊕\r
dk=1\r
(A\r
k\r
⊗B\r
k\r
)⊕C. Here\r
all operators in the algebra haveC in their kernel and\r
act irreducibly on eachA\r
k while acting trivially on the\r
subsystemB\r
k. This means that the algebra decomposes\r
as\r
A=⊕\r
dk=1\r
(L(A\r
k\r
)⊗1\r
B\r
k\r
)⊕0\r
C\r
, (1)\r
whereL(A\r
k) denotes the set of all operators on\r
A\r
k\r
,1\r
B\r
k\r
is the identity operator onB\r
k, and 0C is the zero opera\u0002tor on C. From this perspective, we can view the QEC\r
framework as focussing on codesL(A)⊗1\r
B (or subspaces\r
A) with dimB = 1. Moreover, OQEC considers “subsys\u0002tem codes” encoded in algebras of the form L(A) ⊗ 1B\r
for general subsystemsA andB. Classical information is\r
captured by the case in which dimA = 1: commutative\r
algebras. Thus, in addition to the classical, QEC, and\r
OQEC cases, our new OAQEC approach also provides a\r
framework for the correction of hybrid quantum-classical\r
information and memory [30] exposed to external noise.\r
In particular, this includes cases in which separate (or\u0002thogonal) parcels of quantum information are labelled by\r
classical “addresses”.\r
Let us discuss in more detail the motivation for consid\u0002ering algebras. We begin by recalling that a general ob\u0002servable is a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) X(∆) where ∆ ⊂ Ω, the set in which the observable X\r
takes values. For simplicity we consider observables with\r
a finite number of outcomes which can be characterized\r
by a family of positive operators{X\r
a\r
}. In the Heisen\u0002berg picture an observable evolves according to the unital\r
CP-mapE\r
† with elements\r
E\r
†a\r
instead ofE\r
a. If for all val-

2\r
ues of the label a there exists an operator Ya such that\r
Xa = E\r
†\r
(Ya) then all the statistical information about X\r
has been conserved by E since for any initial state ρ we\r
have, Tr(ρXa) = Tr(ρE\r
†\r
(Ya)) = Tr(E(ρ)Ya), the latter\r
equality following from the definition of E\r
†\r
. In this case,\r
to correct for the errors induced by E we need a channel\r
R that maps each Xa to one of the operators Ya through\r
R†(Xa) = Ya, so that (R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(Xa) = (E\r
† ◦ R†\r
)(Xa) =\r
Xa. In such a scenario, we will say that Xa is correctable\r
for E and conserved by R ◦ E. In particular, if X is\r
a standard projective measurement, and so X2\r
a = Xa\r
for all a, then the projectors Xa linearly span the alge\u0002bra they generate. Hence, in this case R ◦ E conserves\r
an entire commutative algebra. Therefore, focussing on\r
the correctability of sets of observables which have the\r
structure of an algebra, apart from allowing a complete\r
characterization, is also sufficient for the study of all the\r
correctable projective observables.\r
One result of this paper will be to show that there al\u0002ways exists a single channel R correcting all projective\r
observables correctable in the above sense. In fact, we\r
study a more general question: If we have some con\u0002trol on the initial states, which is expected in a quantum\r
computation, then we can ask for an observable to be\r
conserved only if the state starts in a certain subspace\r
P H. That is, P(E\r
† ◦ R†\r
)(X)P = PXP. We derive a\r
necessary and sufficient condition for an entire algebra of\r
operators on P H to be simultaneously correctable in that\r
sense. The resulting theory contains OQEC and QEC in\r
the special cases discussed above.\r
We remark that our approach differs from that of the\r
stabilizer formalism [8] where observables in the Heisen\u0002berg picture are used as a way to characterize a subspace\r
of states. Our approach is closer in spirit to that of [31].\r
The idea that observables naturally characterize subsys\u0002tems has also been exploited in [32].\r
Noiseless subsystems — First we recall the definition\r
of a noiseless subsystem and we give an equivalent def\u0002inition in terms of the dual channel E\r
†\r
. Consider a de\u0002composition of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space H as\r
H = (A ⊗ B) ⊕ C. We introduce the projector P on the\r
subspace A ⊗ B. By definition, A is a noiseless subsys\u0002tem for E if for all ρ ∈ L(A) and σ ∈ L(B) there exists\r
τ ∈ L(B) such that E(ρ ⊗ σ) = ρ ⊗ τ. In terms of the\r
dual channel E\r
†\r
, the subsystem A is noiseless for E if and\r
only if\r
P E\r
†\r
(X ⊗ 1) P = X ⊗ 1 (2)\r
for all operators X acting on A. This is a consequence\r
of the noiseless subsystem characterization from [1] as\r
can be readily verified. In Eq. (2), the projectors P are\r
needed since the definition of the noiseless subsystem is\r
only concerned with what happens to states initially in\r
the subspace A⊗B. In general, an initial component out\u0002side this space may, after evolution, disturb the otherwise\r
noiseless observables.\r
Conserved observables — If PE\r
†\r
(Xa)P = PXaP for\r
all a we say that the observable X is conserved by E for\r
states in P H. More generally, let us say an algebra A is\r
conserved by E for states in P H if every element of A is\r
conserved; that is,\r
P E\r
†\r
(X) P = PXP ∀X ∈ A. (3)\r
Notice that Eq. (3) gives a generalization of noiseless\r
subsystems. Indeed, any subalgebra A of L(P H) for\r
which all elements X ∈ A satisfy Eq. (3) is a direct sum\r
of noiseless subsystems. This can be seen by first not\u0002ing that any algebra A has a decomposition of the form\r
given in Eq. (1), and then applying Eq. (2). In particular,\r
focussing on the so-called “simple” algebras L(A) ⊗ 1\r
B\r
captures standard noiseless subsystems as in Eq. (2).\r
The following theorem provides testable conditions\r
that characterize when an algebra is conserved on states\r
in a given subspace by a channel, strictly in terms of the\r
operation elements for the channel. The result comes as\r
an adaptation of results from [21] and we shall present\r
its proof in [29]. It is a generalization because, here, the\r
algebra need not contain the projector P.\r
Theorem 1. A subalgebra A of L(P H) is conserved on\r
states in P H by a channel E if and only if [EaP, X] = 0\r
for all elements Ea and all X ∈ A.\r
Heuristically, an algebra supported on a subspace is\r
conserved by a channel precisely when elements of the\r
algebra commute with the generators of the noise, re\u0002stricted to the subspace.\r
Error correction of observables — We say that an al\u0002gebra A is correctable for E on states in the subspace P H\r
if there exists a channel R such that\r
P(R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(X)P = PXP ∀X ∈ A. (4)\r
This notion of correctability is more general than the one\r
addressed by the framework of OQEC. Indeed, OQEC fo\u0002cusses on simple algebras, L(A)⊗1\r
B. Here, correctability\r
is defined for any finite-dimensional algebra. A further\r
generalization is that we do not require P to belong to\r
the algebra considered. We expand on these points in\r
[29] via an examination of the Schr¨odinger formulation\r
of OAQEC.\r
We now state the main result of the paper, which gen\u0002eralizes the fundamental result for both QEC [5] and\r
OQEC [1, 18]. It provides conditions for testing whether\r
an algebra is correctable for a given channel in terms of\r
its operation elements.\r
Theorem 2. A subalgebra A of B(P H) is correctable on\r
P H for the channel E if and only if\r
[PE†\r
cEbP, X] = 0 ∀X ∈ A ∀c, b. (5)\r
We present the proof in [29]. Not surprisingly, the\r
operation elements {E†\r
cEb} for E\r
† ◦ E play a key role as

3\r
in other error correction settings. We also note that the\r
correction channel R constructed in the proof corrects\r
any channel whose elements are linear combinations of\r
the elements Ea. Thus, as in the original theory of error\r
correction, we can in practice neglect the channel E and\r
focus instead directly on the discrete error operators Ea.\r
It is instructive to consider the special case of clas\u0002sical OAQEC codes. A classical channel has elements\r
Eij =\r
√pij |iihj|, where (pij ) forms a stochastic matrix\r
with transitional probabilities pij from j to i. Thus,\r
E\r
†\r
ijEkl = δik√pijpil|jihl|, and Theorem 2 shows that if\r
α = (αj ) are the diagonal components of a classical (di\u0002agonal) observable, then α can be corrected if and only\r
if αj = αk for all k, j such that there is an i with pij 6= 0\r
and pik 6= 0. Heuristically, two states cannot be distin\u0002guished from each other after the channel has acted pre\u0002cisely when there is a nonzero probability of a transition\r
from both states to a common state.\r
Does OAQEC offer more powerful error correction pro\u0002cedures than OQEC? It is easy to see that if an algebra\r
A is correctable according to this scheme then each sim\u0002ple sector L(A) ⊗ 1\r
B is individually correctable through\r
OQEC (or QEC when dim B = 1). However, OAQEC\r
codes have at least two attractive features: First, all\r
simple sectors can be corrected simultaneously by the\r
same correction channel. Secondly, each simple sector\r
can be corrected even if the initial state is not entirely\r
in the corresponding subspace. In particular, the initial\r
state could be in a quantum superposition between var\u0002ious sectors even though combined sectors may not be\r
correctable in the traditional sense.\r
As an illustrative example, consider a 2-qubit sys\u0002tem exposed to noise inducing a phase flip error Z\r
(a unitary Pauli operator) on the first qubit with\r
nonzero probability p. The noise model E has elements\r
{\r
√\r
1 − p 1,\r
√\r
p Z1}. Let C1 be the (subspace) code with\r
basis |0Li = |00i, |1Li = |01i and C2 the code with basis\r
|0Li = |10i, |1Li = |11i. It is clear that each of C1 and\r
C2, or from the OAQEC perspective the algebras L(C1)\r
and L(C2), is correctable individually for E. Indeed, each\r
code is a stabilizer subspace for Z1 (for eigenvalue 1 and\r
−1 respectively). However, the combined code C1 ⊕ C2,\r
or equivalently L(C1 ⊕ C2) = L(C\r
4\r
), is clearly not cor\u0002rectable for E because E is not a unitary operation.\r
Nevertheless, the hybrid qubit-qubit OAQEC code\r
A = L(C1) ⊕ L(C2) is correctable for E. This immedi\u0002ately follows from Theorem 2 and the observation that\r
Z1 belongs to the set of operators which commute with\r
A: the commutant A′ = CP1 ⊕ CP2, where we have\r
written Pi for the projector onto Ci. As discussed above,\r
separate (orthogonal) codes that determine the simple\r
summands of an OAQEC code can all be corrected by\r
the same correction operation, which is clearly not the\r
case in general for non-OAQEC codes. Moreover, as in\r
QEC and OQEC, the theory includes an explicit recipe\r
for constructing the correction operation. This point will\r
be elucidated further in [29]. In this case one can eas\u0002ily verify that the channel R with elements {P1, Z1P2}\r
satisfies (R ◦ E)\r
†\r
(X) = X for all X ∈ A.\r
Application: noisy quantum teleportation — In the\r
standard picture for quantum teleportation [33], Alice\r
can send Bob an entire qubit by sending two classical\r
bits, provided they share a maximally entangled pair\r
of qubits initially. Consider a pair of qubits in the\r
maximally entangled state |ψi = √\r
1\r
2\r
(|00i + |11i). We\r
assume that Alice and Bob each possess one qubit of\r
this pair. Consider also the unitary Pauli operators\r
{U0 = 1, U1 = X, U2 = Y, U3 = Z}. In the language\r
of channels, teleportation can be viewed as the channel\r
E that has for input the qubit |ψi to be teleported and\r
for output three qubits: two which represent the bits Al\u0002ice needs to send to Bob, and Bob’s qubit: E(|ψihψ|) =\r

i\r
,where |ii form an orthonor\u0002mal basis of the four-dimensional Hilbert space represent\u0002ing the two bits that Alice must send to Bob over a clas\u0002sical channel. We can readily verify that Bob can indeed\r
fully correct the channel. The channel elements are of the\r
form Ei ∝ |ii⊗Ui, and hence the condition of Theorem 2\r
is met since E\r
†\r
i Ej ∝ hi||ji⊗U\r
†\r
i Uj = δijU\r
†\r
i Ui = δij1. Thus\r
all operators on the initial qubit can be corrected, and all\r
the information can be recovered. Note that even though\r
the operators Ei map between two different spaces, the\r
operators E\r
†\r
i Ej map the initial qubit space to itself. One\r
can teleport as many qubits as desired in parallel pro\u0002vided that one starts with one shared entangled pair per\r
qubit to be teleported.\r
Consider now the case in which the classical step of\r
the teleportation process, when Alice transmits bits to\r
Bob, is implemented over a noisy classical channel. We\r
shall also assume unitary encodings are taken from more\r
general families of unitary operators. To this end, con\u0002sider a family {Ug}g∈S of unitary operators in L(H) for\r
some Hilbert space H. In the standard teleportation pro\u0002tocol, S is the set of single qubit Pauli operators. Now\r
suppose that a noisy stochastic channel is applied on the\r
classical bits |gi, g ∈ S, that Alice must send to Bob\r
with transition probabilities pgh. Then one could ask,\r
what information can be recovered by Bob once he is in\r
possession of all the data? The overall channel is given\r
by composing E with the classical channel. Thus, the\r
error operators Fghl satisfy Fghl ∝\r
√pgh|gihh||li ⊗ Ul =\r
δhl√pgh|gi ⊗ Uh. It follows that the commutant of the\r

general code algebras will be obtained. We shall further\r
investigate this “noisy” version of quantum teleportation\r
in [29].\r
Application: information flow in interactions — Con\u0002sider the interaction U between a system S and an\r
apparatus A where the initial state of the apparatus\r
is known to be ρA. Tracing out either over A or\r
S after the evolution yields respectively the channel\r
ESS(ρS) = TrA(U(ρS ⊗ρA)U\r
†\r
) from S to S or ESA(ρS) =\r
TrS(U(ρS ⊗ ρA)U\r
†\r
) from S to A.\r
Using OAQEC we can determine what observables of\r
the system can be corrected for either of the two chan\u0002nels. The algebra ASA preserved by ESA, that represents\r
the information about S which is transferred to A, can be\r
computed to be the largest algebra of operators commut\u0002ing with the range of E\r
†\r
SS. Hence a direct consequence of\r
Theorem 2 is that in an open dynamics defined by a chan\u0002nel E, full information about a projective observable can\r
escape the system if and only if it commutes with all the\r
operators in the range of the channel; that is, those ob\u0002servables whose first moment is correctable for E. This is\r
a generalization of work in [34]. Furthermore this method\r
characterizes those observables which are effectively du\u0002plicated; in other words, those whose information stayed\r
in S and also flowed to A. They form the commutative\r
algebra ASS ∩ ASA. Those observables have been non\u0002destructively measured by the system A. This analysis\r
has implications for the theory of decoherence [35, 36]: a\r
unique commutative algebra of observables emerges nat\u0002urally as characterizing the information which is shared\r
between the system and the environment after an inter\u0002action. This suggests that the pointer observables should\r
be defined not just by their property of being stably en\u0002coded in the system but also by the requirement that the\r
information they represent is transmitted to the environ\u0002ment. In this sense there is no basis ambiguity [37] for the\r
interpretation of a unitary interaction as a measurement\r
of the system by the apparatus.\r
Outlook — We have presented a generalization of the\r
theory of operator quantum error correction that allows\r
for the correction of an arbitrary algebra of operators.\r
Our main result gives a characterization of correctable\r
codes in this scheme. Proofs and more applications will\r
be provided in [29]. The recent experience with opera\u0002tor quantum error correction suggests a reinvestigation\r
of codes that have appeared in the literature for pos\u0002sibly improved efficiency or other applications enabled\r
by this approach. We also suggest that the applications\r
to quantum teleportation and information flow presented\r
here warrant further investigation. Furthermore, we have\r
here focussed on algebras of operators rather than gen\u0002eral operator subspaces. It should be most interesting\r
to consider the possible conservation of the statistics of\r
general POVMs.\r
