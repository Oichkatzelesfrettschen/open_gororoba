Abstract.\r
Isospectrality of the planar domains which are obtained by successive\r
unfolding of a fundamental building block is studied in relation to iso-length\r
spectrality of the corresponding domains. Although an explicit and exact trace\r
formula such as Poisson’s summation formula or Selberg’s trace formula is not\r
known to exist for such planar domains, equivalence between isospectrality and\r
iso-length spectrality in a certain setting can be proved by employing the matrix\r
representation of “transplantation of eigenfunctions”. As an application of the\r
equivalence, transplantable pairs of domains, which are all isospectral pair of\r
planar domains and therefore counter examples of Kac’s question “can one hear\r
the shape of a drum?”, are numerically enumerated and it is found at least up\r
to the domain composed of 13 building blocks transplantable pairs coincide with\r
those constructed by the method due to Sunada.\r
1. Introduction\r
A famous question of M. Kac, “can one hear the shape of a drum?”, is concerned\r
with isospectrality of the planar domains [1]. The bounded domains D1 and D2 are\r
called isospectral if two domains have the same eigenvalue spectrum up to the degree\r
of multiplicities, i.e., spec(D1) = spec(D2), where\r
spec(D) = {µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · | ∆fi = µifiin D, fi = 0 on ∂D (i = 1, 2, · · ·)}.(1)\r
Kac’s question is alternatively stated as “are the planar domains D1 and D2 congruent\r
if spec(D1) = spec(D2)?”.\r
Iso-length spectrality of the domains is analogously introduced for the length\r
spectrum of closed billiard trajectories on the corresponding domains D1 and D2.\r
Also for iso-length spectrality one can pose the same question as Kac’s. The problem\r
we discuss here is equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality on the\r
planar domains of a certain class.\r
If either the eigenvalue spectrum or the length spectrum determines the shape of\r
the domain uniquely, the equivalence problem becomes obvious since a congruent pair\r
of domains trivially provides both isospectrum and iso-length spectrum. However, it\r
is known that there exists a non-trivial case where equivalence between isospectrality\r
and iso-length spectrality is concluded. Such a situation was reported by Milnor for\r
the first time [2]. It is known that there exist the self-dual lattices L1 and L2 in\r
R\r
16 which are not congruent in the sense that no rotation of R16 carries L1 to L2,

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 2\r
nevertheless they own the same length spectrum. That is, the quotients of R16 by these\r
lattices, R16/L1 and R16/L2 are non-isometric but iso-length spectral. Furthermore\r
its isospectrality can also be derived from the exact trace formula which represents\r
duality relation between the spectrum of Laplacian acting on the flat torus and the\r
corresponding length spectrum of closed geodesics. The flat torus which is defined as\r
a quotient Rn/Γ of Rn by a lattice Γ of rank n, the set of eigenvalues of Helmholtz\r
equation ∆f = µf is explicitly given as,\r
{4π\r
2\r
kσk\r
2\r
| σ ∈ Γ\r
∗\r
}. (2)\r
Here Γ∗ denotes the dual lattice of Γ, i.e., Γ∗ = {σ ∈ Rn | σ · γ ∈ Z ∀γ ∈ Γ}. The\r
corresponding length spectrum which is the set of closed geodesics on the same torus\r
is expressed just by the distance between the origin and each lattice point on Γ:\r
{kγk | γ ∈ Γ}. (3)\r
The two spectra are connected via Poisson’s summation formula or Jacobi identity:\r
X\r
σ∈Γ∗\r

t) = (4πt)\r
−n/2\r
vol(Rn/Γ)X\r
γ∈Γ\r
exp(−kγk\r
2\r
/4t). (4)\r
This trace formula immediately leads us to equivalence between the isospectrality and\r
iso-length spectrality, that is, two flat tori are isospectral if and only if they have the\r
same length spectrum. Milnor’s work is not a direct answer to the original version\r
of Kac’s question because it is not concerned with the planar domains. But from\r
Milnor’s example one learned that there really exist non-congruent domains with a\r
common length and eigenvalue spectrum.\r
In more general cases where two Riemannian manifolds have a common finite\r
Riemannian covering, a sufficient condition for isospectrality was given by Sunada [3].\r
Let G be a finite group which acts freely on a certain compact Riemannian manifold\r
M by isometries. Sunada’s theorem tells us that the quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are\r
isospectral if there exist two subgroups H1 and H2 of G, which satisfy so-called almost\r
conjugate condition:\r
♯\r
([g] ∩ H1) =♯([g] ∩ H2) (5)\r
for any conjugacy class [g] in G. The proof is based on a sort of trace formula which\r
can be regarded as a prototype of the Selberg trace formula [3, 4]. If subgroups H1\r
and H2 are conjugate in the usual sense, then these quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are\r
merely isometric. However it had been known that there exist triplets (G, H1, H2)\r
so that H1 and H2 are almost conjugate but not conjugate in G. Such triplets were\r
used to construct some isospectral but non-isometric pairs of Riemannian surfaces by\r
Buser [5] and Brooks and Tse [6]. Sunada also proved that M/H1 and M/H2 have\r
the same length spectrum of closed geodesics [3]. Therefore, in this case, iso-length\r
spectrality is derived together with isospectrality from the same source.\r
In case of planar domains, after a quarter of century, Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert\r
[7] solved Kac’s original question also negatively by constructing an isospectral but\r
non-congruent pair of planar domains (see Fig. 1). For the construction, they used\r
a version of Sunada’s theorem, which was extended to the orbiford (billiard) setting\r
by B´erard [8]. Since the source of isospectrality was Sunada’s theorem, iso-length\r
spectrality naturally follows as well.\r
However, if there exists an isospectral pair of planar domains which are not\r
given by Sunada’s construction, equivalence of isospectrality and iso-length spectrality\r
cannot straightforwardly be discussed. In fact, no one can exclude such a situation

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 3\r
because the Sunada’s condition gives merely a sufficient condition for the isospectrality\r
and also iso-length spectrality. Nevertheless, as we will show below, it is possible to\r
relate them through the notion of so-called transplantation of eigenfunctions. The\r
transplantation method is originally invented by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler\r
to reexamine isospectrality of some given domains [9]. They constructed 17 families\r
of isospectral pairs of domains based on the Sunada’s method, and confirmed these\r
isospectrality by the transplantation method. As far as planar domains are concerned,\r
these pairs are, to authors’ knowledge, all isospectral pairs ever known.\r
It should be remarked that the transplantation method is not independent of the\r
Sunada’s theorem. In the above case of quotient manifolds, Brooks gave an alternative\r
proof of Sunada’s theorem based on the transplantation method, which appears a\r
necessary condition for the assumption of the theorem [10] . However equivalence\r
between these two methods has not been proved in case of planar domains.\r
Figure 1. Isospectral pairs of domains constructed by Gordon et al .\r
The organization of this paper is as follows. We first explain the transplantation\r
method in section 2 and give its matrix representation in section 3. In section 4, we\r
provide a proof showing that isospectrality and iso-length spectrality is equivalent for\r
a certain class of domains, that is, those domains constructed by successive unfolding\r
of a fundamental building block. All isospectral pairs ever known belong to this class.\r
In section 5 we enumerate isospectral pairs of domains and compared them with the\r
table obtained by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler [9]. It is shown that our labor\r
of searching isospectral pairs is considerably reduced as a bi-product of our result in\r
section 4. Section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion of our work.\r
2. Transplantation method\r
Let us consider two domains D1 and D2 as Fig. 2. We here describe the\r
transplantation method by taking an example of the proof of isospectrality based\r
on it. We follow the exposition given by Buser et al [9].\r
Transplantation is a procedure which is cutting an arbitrary function f defined\r
on D1 into its restrictions on each building block, say f1, f2, . . . , f7, and rebuilding a\r
new function g on D2 by superposing f1, f2, . . . , f7. Note that such a procedure relied\r
crucially on the peculiarity of the domains, which are composed of several pieces\r
obtained by successive reflection of a certain common building block.\r
By the transplantation shown in Fig. 2, any eigenfunction f with any eigenvalue\r
µ on D1 is transplanted onto D2 so that the transform g is also an eigenfunction

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 4\r
with the same eigenvalue µ. This can actually be confirmed by checking the following\r
conditions:\r
• ∆g = µg in the interior of each piece.\r
This is always true because g is given as a sum of several fi’s on each piece.\r
• The function g is smoothly connected on all reflecting segments\r
This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the reflecting segment r in Fig.\r
2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 fits smoothly with +f2 + f6 − f7 because f3 and\r
f6, or −f5 and −f7 was smoothly connected on the original domain D1 and −f2\r
and f2 also fits smoothly on the segment by the reflection principle. We can also\r
check the smoothness condition on the other reflecting segments in the same way.\r
• The function g vanishes on the boundary of D2.\r
This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the boundary segment b in Fig.\r
2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 vanishes because −f2 cancels f3 there and f5 was\r
already zero. We can also check the boundary condition on the other boundary\r
segments in the same way.\r
One more condition is invertibility of transplantation, which guarantees that the\r
dimensions of the space belonging to the eigenvalue µ, i.e., the multiplicity of µ,\r
on D1 is equal to the dimension on D2 or less. This is expressed as the condition,\r
• The transplantation is invertible as a linear map.\r
This is not trivial, but can be easily checked to be true for this example.\r
Thus these four conditions lead to Spec(D1) ⊂ Spec(D2). The last condition\r
becomes the check to see that any eigenfunction with any eigenvalue ν on D2 can\r
be transplanted onto D1 conversely, that is, spec(D2) ⊂ spec(D1). In this way, we\r
know that these two domains are isospectral.\r

These are conditions for eigenfunctions satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions,\r
but they are also Neumann isospectral. This can be verified by changing all the\r
minus signs before each element of transplanted function fi to the plus one when one\r
superposes them on the transformed domain. Conversely it is possible to construct\r
Dirichlet isospectral pairs once Neumann isospectral are at hand. The procedure is\r
as follows: (i) for both domains, attach the code σi = 1 or -1 to each building block\r
i such that the codes of neighboring blocks are different, (ii) let the building block i

with code σi be transformed onto the building block i\r
′ with code σ′\r
i\r
, and if σiσi\r
′ = 1\r
then the sign before fiis set to be plus and otherwise minus. It is easy to show that\r
the resulting pair of domains are Dirichlet isospectral. Therefore, isospectrality with\r
respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is equivalent.\r
We also remark that the above proof is independent of the choice of a building\r
block. This means that this example represents not only a single pair of isospectral\r
domains but also a family of isospectral pairs, which are realized by replacing a\r
building triangle simultaneously with another shaped building block. In particular,\r
we can obtain the example of Gordon et al . in Fig. 1 by replacing the building block\r
in Fig. 2 by a heptagon.\r
3. Transplantability and its matrix representation\r
In this section, we provide an alternative and more transparent condition for the\r
transplantability of eigenfunctions. In what follows, we limit ourselves to the class of\r
domains constructed by successive reflection of a fundamental building block, which\r
we call unfolded domains, since transplantation of eigenfunctions is most simply done\r
between such domains. In order to make successive unfolding possible, each building\r
block is supposed to have three line segments at which the building block is reflected.\r
The domains shown in Figs 1 and 2 are the examples. Hereafter we denote N as the\r
number of building blocks composing the unfolded domain.\r
The whole shape of the unfolded domain is determined by the choice of the\r
building block and the rule specifying unfolding. The unfolding rule can be identified\r
with the edge-colored graph and the correspondence is given in table 1. Each\r
piece obtained by reflection is represented by the vertex of the graph, and the\r
reflecting segment by its edge. The three boundary segments of the building block\r
are distinguished by the color of the edges. Some boundary segments of the building\r
block form the boundary of the whole unfolded domain, and we represent the edge\r
corresponding to one of such boundary segments as the closed loop. An example of\r
edge-colored graph is demonstrated in Fig. 3.\r
Table 1.\r
unfolding rule edge-colored graph\r
pieces ←→ vertices\r
reflecting segments ←→ edges\r
kind of segment ←→ color of edge\r
The structure of a graph is also represented by the adjacency matrix. That is, the\r
reflecting rule to generate an unfolded domain P is given by the triplet of adjacency\r
matrices MP\r
a\r
, MP\r
b\r
, and MP\r
c defined as follows:\r
(MP\r
γ\r
)\r
ij =\r
(\r
1 if the piece i is adjacent to j by segment γ\r
0 otherwise\r
. (6)\r
γ = a, b, c.\r
Diagonal element (MP\r
γ\r
)\r
ii is set to be 1 if the piece i has the boundary segment γ. The\r
adjacency matrix is, in general, not uniquely determined even if one fixed the graph\r
because there remains a freedom to determine the order of labeling vertices. In this

Figure 3. An example of edge-colored graph representing an unfolding rule. The\r
three types of lines(solid, dotted, broken with dots) denote three colors.\r
setting, two unfolded domains P and Q are congruent if there exists a permutation\r
matrix U such that\r

a\r
, UMP\r
b U\r
−1 = MQ\r
b\r
, UMP\r
c U\r
−1 = MQ\r
c\r
. (7)\r
Here the permutation matrix is defined as a N ×N matrix in which each row or column\r
has only one unity, and all the other elements are zero. If the building block has some\r
symmetry, for example reflecting symmetry with respect to a certain axis, it might\r
happen that non-permutation matrix connects the congruent pair P and Q. However,\r
if one destructs the symmetry by changing the shape of the building block, such an\r
“accidental” situation can be avoided. The condition (7) for a permutation matrix U,\r
therefore, becomes the necessary and sufficient condition for the congruency of P and\r
Q in this sense.\r
Next we give the condition for transplantability of eigenfunction of two given\r
unfolded domains using the adjacency matrices. By transplantability we mean the\r
possibility that isospectrality of a pair of unfolded domains can be verified by the\r
transplantation method.\r
The transplantation procedure described in section 3 is explicitly expressed as\r
follows. Let P and Q be two unfolded domains composed of N copies of a common\r
building block. Let T : L\r
2\r
(P) ∋ f 7→ g ∈ L\r
2\r
(Q) be a linear transformation. We\r
say that the transformation T is a transplantation if the transform g is obtained by\r
cutting and pasting f, namely,\r
gi =\r
X\r
N\r
j=1\r
Tijfj, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, (8)\r
where fj and gi denote restrictions of f and g = T f to each piece, respectively. Also\r
as mentioned in section 2, it is not trivial at all that the transform g becomes an\r
eigenfunction on the transformed domain at this stage.\r
For given unfolded domains P and Q, we say that they are transplantable if there\r
exists an invertible transplantation T satisfying the following conditions:\r
TMP\r
a T\r
−1 = MQ\r
a\r
, TMP\r
b T\r
−1 = MQ\r
b\r
, TMP\r
c T\r
−1 = MQ\r
c\r
. (9)\r
It can be easily checked that smoothness on all the reflecting segments and the\r
boundary conditions on the unfolded domains are satisfied if the above conditions

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 7\r
are fulfilled. Here, existence of the inverse matrix T\r
−1\r
corresponds to the invertible\r
condition. The condition (9) is the one for transplantability of Neumann boundary\r
condition, but as remarked in section 2, it is equivalent to transplantability of the\r
Dirichlet case. As was seen in the previous section, P and Q are isospectral if they\r
are transplantable.\r
Note that if T is a permutation matrix, then P and Q are merely congruent.\r
Therefore, in order to construct isospectral but non-congruent pair of unfolded\r
domains, we must find a matrix satisfying the condition (9), but not a permutation\r
matrix.\r
4. Transplantability and iso-length spectrality\r
We next consider the length spectrum of the unfolded domain. The length spectrum\r
is the set of length of closed trajectories or periodic orbits on the billiard domain. We\r
first consider the relation between closed trajectories on the unfolded domain P and\r
its fundamental building block B. Note that any periodic orbit on P can be regarded\r
as the lift of a closed trajectory on B, because its projection is always a periodic orbit\r
on B. However, the converse is not necessarily true. A single closed orbit on B yields\r
N trajectories as its lift on the unfolded domain P, which are sometimes closed orbits\r
on P but the others not. By the construction of the adjacency matrix MP\r
γ\r
, it is easy\r
to see that the number of closed lifts of a given closed trajectory on B is counted as\r
n\r
P\r
(γ) = Tr(MP\r
γmMP\r
γm−1\r
· · · MP\r
γ1\r
), (10)\r
where γ = γ1γ2 · · · γm (γi = a, b, c) denotes the sequence representing in which order\r
a given closed trajectory on B hits the boundary segments (for example, see Fig.\r
4). Such a sequence is not determined uniquely for a given closed orbit. In fact, if\r
γ = γ1γ2 · · · γm is a sequence specifying some closed trajectory, then all sequences\r
obtained by its cyclic shift such as γ2 · · · γmγ1, γ3 · · · γmγ1γ2, etc. can be regarded as\r
the sequence giving to the same closed trajectory. However the number of closed lifts\r
is invariant because of the relation:\r
Tr(MP\r
γm\r
· · · MP\r
γ2MPγ1\r
) = Tr(MP\r
γ1MPγm\r
· · · MP\r
γ2MPγ1\r
(MP\r
γ1\r
)\r
−1\r
)\r
= Tr(MP\r
γ1MPγm\r
· · · MP\r
γ2\r
)\r
= · · · .\r
(11)\r
Thus the length spectrum of closed trajectories for P is determined by the length\r
spectrum for B and n\r
P (γ).\r
In order that two unfolded domains P and Q constructed by the same-shaped\r
building block B have the same length spectrum, it is sufficient that the numbers of\r
closed lifts should coincide for all possible sequences of γ. It can easily be checked that\r
n\r
P (γ) and nQ(γ) are invariant if P and Q are transplantable, i.e., the condition (9)\r
is satisfied for the adjacent matrices of P and Q. Therefore we obtain the following\r
claim.\r
Proposition 1 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive\r
reflections of the same building block . If P and Q are transplantable, then n\r
P (γ) =\r
n\r
Q(γ) for any sequence γ, which leads to iso-length spectrality of P and Q.\r
The inverse of the above proposition is to inquire whether or not n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ)\r
gives the sufficient condition for transplantability. The following statement gives its

Figure 4. Lifts of a closed billiard trajectory o with the sequence γ = babacbacbc.\r
For the sequence γ, n\r
P (γ) is equal to 1.\r
answer: the condition n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) is precisely the analog of the transplantability\r
of eigenfunctions.\r
Proposition 2 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive\r
reflection of the same building block. If n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for any sequence γ, then P\r
and Q are transplantable, which leads to isospectrality of P and Q.\r
Proof We have shown that transplantability implies isospectrality in section 3. Here\r
we will show that transplantability follows from n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ). Let GP and GQ be\r
the groups generated by adjacency matrices:\r
G\r
P = hMP\r
a\r
, MP\r
b\r
, MP\r
c\r
i, GQ = hMQ\r
a\r
, MQ\r
b\r
, MQ\r
c\r
i. (12)\r
Since adjacency matrices themselves are also permutation matrices introduced in\r
section 4, GP and GQ are subgroups of the symmetric group SN , so they are finite.\r
Let F3 be a free group generated by characters a, b, and c. We can define surjective\r
homomorphism:\r
Φ\r
P\r
: F3 ∋ γ1γ2 . . . γm 7−→ MP\r
γmMP\r
γm−1\r
· · · MP\r
γ1\r
∈ G\r
P\r
, (13)\r
then GP is isomorphic to F3/ ker ΦP . GQ is also isomorphic to F3/ ker ΦQ.\r
We now assume that n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for any sequence γ, and note that MP\r
γ =\r
E ⇔ nP (γ) = N, where E denotes N × N identity matrix. Then we have\r
ker ΦP = {γ | MP\r
γ = E}\r
= {γ | nP (γ) = N}\r
= {γ | nQ(γ) = N}\r
= {γ | MQ\r
γ = E}.\r
= ker ΦQ\r
(14)

Here MP\r
γ\r

γ denote MPγmMPγm−1\r
· · · MP\r
γ1\r
and MQ\r
γmMQγm−1\r
· · · MQ\r

, respectively.\r
This means that GP is isomorphic to GQ. We can suppose identity maps:\r
ρ\r
P\r
: G\r
P → GL(N, C), ρQ : GQ → GL(N, C) (15)\r
to be linear representations of GP and GQ, respectively. Since GP is isomorphic to\r
GQ,\r
ρ : G\r
P ∋ MP\r
γ\r
7→ MQ\r
γ ∈ GL(N, C) (16)\r
is another linear representation of GP . Note that n\r
P (γ) and nQ(γ) become the\r
characters of representations ρ\r
P and ρ respectively, and they are equal by our\r
assumption. Character theory tells that two representations with the same character\r
are similar[11]. This means that there exists an invertible matrix T such that\r
TMP\r
γ = MQγ T for any γ (17)\r
This leads to transplantability between P and Q. (Q.E.D)\r
By propositions 1 and 2, we know equivalence between transplantability\r
and coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts, which are sufficient conditions\r
for isospectrality and iso-length spectrality respectively. However if we assume\r
transplantability, which is more strict condition than isospectrality, then iso-length\r
spectrality follows. Conversely, we assume coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts,\r
as a sufficient condition for iso-length spectrality, then isospectrality follows. Our\r
results can be summarized as the following schema.\r
isospectrality ⇐ transplantability\r
⇔ ∀γ nP(γ) = n\r
Q(γ)\r
⇒ iso-length spectrality\r
5. List of transplantable pairs for N ≤ 13\r
As an application of the above propositions, we enumerate isospectral pairs of unfolded\r
domains whose isospectrality can be verified by the transplantation method. The\r
candidate space we have to explore is the set UN which consists of all possible edge\u0002colored graphs without cycles, each of which represents an unfolding rule. The absence\r
of cycles guarantees for the unfolded domain to be formed flatly for any shaped building\r
block.\r
The advantage to use the propositions 1 and 2 (and their proof) is that even\r
for the purpose of listing up transplantable pairs(or triplets if possible), we do not\r
have to make pairwise comparisons. This is because we can regard each relation\r
n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) as a necessary condition for the transplantability of P and Q, and use\r
each relation as a “filter” to pick up transplantable candidates. More precise steps to\r
find out the transplantable pairs is as follows:\r
(i) For all edge-colored graphs P in UN , compute the character n\r
P (γ) for all possible\r
γ.\r
(ii) prepare the spectrum of characters {n\r
P (γ)} by ordering the character nP (γ)\r
according to an appropriate rule for γ (lexicographical order of sequence γ, for\r
example).\r
(iii) pick up the pair of edge-colored graphs whose character spectra are the same.

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 10\r
According to the proposition 2, if one finds the identical character spectra, i.e.,\r
{n\r
P (γ)} = {nQ(γ)}, they yield the transplantable pairs. One might be afraid that the\r
step (i), i.e., enumeration of the character spectrum seems to require infinite number\r
of steps, reflecting the fact that γ should run over all possible sequences composed of\r
a, b, c. However, this is not the case, since GP only forms a finite group as mentioned\r
in the proof of proposition 2.\r
It is interesting to note that coincidence of the “ground state”, i.e., n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ)\r
for null sequence of γ leads that the number of building blocks forming the unfolded\r
domains is equal, which can be read that the area of two domains are equal. Also the\r
condition for the “first exited state”, i.e., n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) where γ = a, b or c, gives\r
the condition for the length of the boundary to coincide. These geometrical quantities\r
agree with the first and second terms in the Weyl expansion respectively [1, 12, 13].\r

Applying the above procedure to the edge colored graphs up to N = 13, we have\r
enumerated all possible transplantable pairs, which are listed in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows\r
isospectral pairs ever known, which are listed in [9]. Our result completely agrees with\r
the list of known transplantable pairs presented in Fig. 5 at least up to N = 13. Note\r
that all 17 examples given in [9] have been generated based on the Sunada’s method.\r
6. Summary and discussion\r
We have shown that transplantability of eigenfunctions on unfolded domains is\r
equivalent to coincidence of the character spectrum {n(γ)}. The former is a sufficient\r
condition for isospectrality and the latter for iso-length spectrality.\r
As mentioned in the introduction, if so-called almost conjugate condition (5) is\r
satisfied for a pair of subgroups H1 and H2, one knows that the quotients M/H1 and\r
M/H2 are isospectral, and iso-length spectrality of M/H1 and M/H2 simultaneously\r
follows. The first counter example of Kac’s original problem has been constructed\r
with this Sunada’s condition [7]. Once an isospectral pair is obtained based on such\r
a group theoretical argument together with the orbifold construction, one can easily\r
check isospectrality of the resulting pair using the transplantation method. In this way,\r
at the beginning, transplantation procedure serves only as a check or demonstration\r
for a given pair of domains to be really isospectral. It is uncertain whether or not there\r
exist transplantable pairs of domains which are not constructed based on the Sunada’s\r
condition, while the Sunada’s condition is a sufficient condition for transplantability.\r
However, by expressing an explicit condition (5) for transplantability using\r
adjacency matrices, one notices the similarity between the almost conjugate condition\r
(5) in Sunada’s theorem and the condition for existence of non permutation matrix T\r
in (9). Even if there exists an invertible matrix T satisfying (9), it is not necessarily

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 11\r
true that they give an isospectral pair because they are congruent if T is merely\r
a permutation matrix. Such a situation reminds us of the case where the almost\r
conjugate condition (5) is satisfied but the subgroups H1 and H2 are conjugate, which\r
gives only an isometric pair.\r
Therefore it would become a natural question to inquire about the relation\r
between the Sunada’s construction of isospectral domains and the transplantation\r
method. Numerical enumeration attempted in section 5 elucidated that at least up to\r
N = 13 all the transplantable pairs are those pairs derived by Sunada’s method. This\r
suggests the possibility of its equivalence.\r
The condition n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for all possible sequences of γ, which is\r
equivalent to transplantability of eigenfunctions, provides not only an efficient\r
algorithm to enumerate transplantable pairs of planar domains, but has an interesting\r
“geometrical” interpretation: Each n\r
P (γ) plays a role of the coefficient of Weyl\r
expansion as mentioned in section 5.\r
Transplantation method, on which we have relied in this paper, is available only\r
to the class of unfolded domains. Whether isospectrality is equivalent to iso-length\r
spectrality in more general domains is still an open problem.\r

Abstract.\r
Isospectrality of the planar domains which are obtained by successive\r
unfolding of a fundamental building block is studied in relation to iso-length\r
spectrality of the corresponding domains. Although an explicit and exact trace\r
formula such as Poisson’s summation formula or Selberg’s trace formula is not\r
known to exist for such planar domains, equivalence between isospectrality and\r
iso-length spectrality in a certain setting can be proved by employing the matrix\r
representation of “transplantation of eigenfunctions”. As an application of the\r
equivalence, transplantable pairs of domains, which are all isospectral pair of\r
planar domains and therefore counter examples of Kac’s question “can one hear\r
the shape of a drum?”, are numerically enumerated and it is found at least up\r
to the domain composed of 13 building blocks transplantable pairs coincide with\r
those constructed by the method due to Sunada."""

A famous question of M. Kac, “can one hear the shape of a drum?”, is concerned\r
with isospectrality of the planar domains [1]. The bounded domains D1 and D2 are\r
called isospectral if two domains have the same eigenvalue spectrum up to the degree\r
of multiplicities, i.e., spec(D1) = spec(D2), where\r
spec(D) = {µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · | ∆fi = µifiin D, fi = 0 on ∂D (i = 1, 2, · · ·)}.(1)\r
Kac’s question is alternatively stated as “are the planar domains D1 and D2 congruent\r
if spec(D1) = spec(D2)?”.\r
Iso-length spectrality of the domains is analogously introduced for the length\r
spectrum of closed billiard trajectories on the corresponding domains D1 and D2.\r
Also for iso-length spectrality one can pose the same question as Kac’s. The problem\r
we discuss here is equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality on the\r
planar domains of a certain class.\r
If either the eigenvalue spectrum or the length spectrum determines the shape of\r
the domain uniquely, the equivalence problem becomes obvious since a congruent pair\r
of domains trivially provides both isospectrum and iso-length spectrum. However, it\r
is known that there exists a non-trivial case where equivalence between isospectrality\r
and iso-length spectrality is concluded. Such a situation was reported by Milnor for\r
the first time [2]. It is known that there exist the self-dual lattices L1 and L2 in\r
R\r
16 which are not congruent in the sense that no rotation of R16 carries L1 to L2,

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 2\r
nevertheless they own the same length spectrum. That is, the quotients of R16 by these\r
lattices, R16/L1 and R16/L2 are non-isometric but iso-length spectral. Furthermore\r
its isospectrality can also be derived from the exact trace formula which represents\r
duality relation between the spectrum of Laplacian acting on the flat torus and the\r
corresponding length spectrum of closed geodesics. The flat torus which is defined as\r
a quotient Rn/Γ of Rn by a lattice Γ of rank n, the set of eigenvalues of Helmholtz\r
equation ∆f = µf is explicitly given as,\r
{4π\r
2\r
kσk\r
2\r
| σ ∈ Γ\r
∗\r
}. (2)\r
Here Γ∗ denotes the dual lattice of Γ, i.e., Γ∗ = {σ ∈ Rn | σ · γ ∈ Z ∀γ ∈ Γ}. The\r
corresponding length spectrum which is the set of closed geodesics on the same torus\r
is expressed just by the distance between the origin and each lattice point on Γ:\r
{kγk | γ ∈ Γ}. (3)\r
The two spectra are connected via Poisson’s summation formula or Jacobi identity:\r
X\r
σ∈Γ∗\r
exp(−4π\r

t) = (4πt)\r
−n/2\r
vol(Rn/Γ)X\r
γ∈Γ\r
exp(−kγk\r
2\r
/4t). (4)\r
This trace formula immediately leads us to equivalence between the isospectrality and\r
iso-length spectrality, that is, two flat tori are isospectral if and only if they have the\r
same length spectrum. Milnor’s work is not a direct answer to the original version\r
of Kac’s question because it is not concerned with the planar domains. But from\r
Milnor’s example one learned that there really exist non-congruent domains with a\r
common length and eigenvalue spectrum.\r
In more general cases where two Riemannian manifolds have a common finite\r
Riemannian covering, a sufficient condition for isospectrality was given by Sunada [3].\r
Let G be a finite group which acts freely on a certain compact Riemannian manifold\r
M by isometries. Sunada’s theorem tells us that the quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are\r
isospectral if there exist two subgroups H1 and H2 of G, which satisfy so-called almost\r
conjugate condition:\r
♯\r
([g] ∩ H1) =♯([g] ∩ H2) (5)\r
for any conjugacy class [g] in G. The proof is based on a sort of trace formula which\r
can be regarded as a prototype of the Selberg trace formula [3, 4]. If subgroups H1\r
and H2 are conjugate in the usual sense, then these quotients M/H1 and M/H2 are\r
merely isometric. However it had been known that there exist triplets (G, H1, H2)\r
so that H1 and H2 are almost conjugate but not conjugate in G. Such triplets were\r
used to construct some isospectral but non-isometric pairs of Riemannian surfaces by\r
Buser [5] and Brooks and Tse [6]. Sunada also proved that M/H1 and M/H2 have\r
the same length spectrum of closed geodesics [3]. Therefore, in this case, iso-length\r
spectrality is derived together with isospectrality from the same source.\r
In case of planar domains, after a quarter of century, Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert\r
[7] solved Kac’s original question also negatively by constructing an isospectral but\r
non-congruent pair of planar domains (see Fig. 1). For the construction, they used\r
a version of Sunada’s theorem, which was extended to the orbiford (billiard) setting\r
by B´erard [8]. Since the source of isospectrality was Sunada’s theorem, iso-length\r
spectrality naturally follows as well.\r
However, if there exists an isospectral pair of planar domains which are not\r
given by Sunada’s construction, equivalence of isospectrality and iso-length spectrality\r
cannot straightforwardly be discussed. In fact, no one can exclude such a situation

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 3\r
because the Sunada’s condition gives merely a sufficient condition for the isospectrality\r
and also iso-length spectrality. Nevertheless, as we will show below, it is possible to\r
relate them through the notion of so-called transplantation of eigenfunctions. The\r
transplantation method is originally invented by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler\r
to reexamine isospectrality of some given domains [9]. They constructed 17 families\r
of isospectral pairs of domains based on the Sunada’s method, and confirmed these\r
isospectrality by the transplantation method. As far as planar domains are concerned,\r
these pairs are, to authors’ knowledge, all isospectral pairs ever known.\r
It should be remarked that the transplantation method is not independent of the\r
Sunada’s theorem. In the above case of quotient manifolds, Brooks gave an alternative\r
proof of Sunada’s theorem based on the transplantation method, which appears a\r
necessary condition for the assumption of the theorem [10] . However equivalence\r
between these two methods has not been proved in case of planar domains.\r
Figure 1. Isospectral pairs of domains constructed by Gordon et al .\r
The organization of this paper is as follows. We first explain the transplantation\r
method in section 2 and give its matrix representation in section 3. In section 4, we\r
provide a proof showing that isospectrality and iso-length spectrality is equivalent for\r
a certain class of domains, that is, those domains constructed by successive unfolding\r
of a fundamental building block. All isospectral pairs ever known belong to this class.\r
In section 5 we enumerate isospectral pairs of domains and compared them with the\r
table obtained by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler [9]. It is shown that our labor\r
of searching isospectral pairs is considerably reduced as a bi-product of our result in\r
section 4. Section 6 is devoted to summary and discussion of our work."""

Let us consider two domains D1 and D2 as Fig. 2. We here describe the\r
transplantation method by taking an example of the proof of isospectrality based\r
on it. We follow the exposition given by Buser et al [9].\r
Transplantation is a procedure which is cutting an arbitrary function f defined\r
on D1 into its restrictions on each building block, say f1, f2, . . . , f7, and rebuilding a\r
new function g on D2 by superposing f1, f2, . . . , f7. Note that such a procedure relied\r
crucially on the peculiarity of the domains, which are composed of several pieces\r
obtained by successive reflection of a certain common building block.\r
By the transplantation shown in Fig. 2, any eigenfunction f with any eigenvalue\r
µ on D1 is transplanted onto D2 so that the transform g is also an eigenfunction

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 4\r
with the same eigenvalue µ. This can actually be confirmed by checking the following\r
conditions:\r
• ∆g = µg in the interior of each piece.\r
This is always true because g is given as a sum of several fi’s on each piece.\r
• The function g is smoothly connected on all reflecting segments\r
This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the reflecting segment r in Fig.\r
2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 fits smoothly with +f2 + f6 − f7 because f3 and\r
f6, or −f5 and −f7 was smoothly connected on the original domain D1 and −f2\r
and f2 also fits smoothly on the segment by the reflection principle. We can also\r
check the smoothness condition on the other reflecting segments in the same way.\r
• The function g vanishes on the boundary of D2.\r
This is not trivial, but true on this example. On the boundary segment b in Fig.\r
2, for example, −f2 + f3 − f5 vanishes because −f2 cancels f3 there and f5 was\r
already zero. We can also check the boundary condition on the other boundary\r
segments in the same way.\r
One more condition is invertibility of transplantation, which guarantees that the\r
dimensions of the space belonging to the eigenvalue µ, i.e., the multiplicity of µ,\r
on D1 is equal to the dimension on D2 or less. This is expressed as the condition,\r
• The transplantation is invertible as a linear map.\r
This is not trivial, but can be easily checked to be true for this example.\r
Thus these four conditions lead to Spec(D1) ⊂ Spec(D2). The last condition\r
becomes the check to see that any eigenfunction with any eigenvalue ν on D2 can\r
be transplanted onto D1 conversely, that is, spec(D2) ⊂ spec(D1). In this way, we\r
know that these two domains are isospectral.\r

These are conditions for eigenfunctions satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions,\r
but they are also Neumann isospectral. This can be verified by changing all the\r
minus signs before each element of transplanted function fi to the plus one when one\r
superposes them on the transformed domain. Conversely it is possible to construct\r
Dirichlet isospectral pairs once Neumann isospectral are at hand. The procedure is\r
as follows: (i) for both domains, attach the code σi = 1 or -1 to each building block\r
i such that the codes of neighboring blocks are different, (ii) let the building block i

with code σi be transformed onto the building block i\r
′ with code σ′\r
i\r
, and if σiσi\r
′ = 1\r
then the sign before fiis set to be plus and otherwise minus. It is easy to show that\r
the resulting pair of domains are Dirichlet isospectral. Therefore, isospectrality with\r
respect to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is equivalent.\r
We also remark that the above proof is independent of the choice of a building\r
block. This means that this example represents not only a single pair of isospectral\r
domains but also a family of isospectral pairs, which are realized by replacing a\r
building triangle simultaneously with another shaped building block. In particular,\r
we can obtain the example of Gordon et al . in Fig. 1 by replacing the building block\r
in Fig. 2 by a heptagon."""

In this section, we provide an alternative and more transparent condition for the\r
transplantability of eigenfunctions. In what follows, we limit ourselves to the class of\r
domains constructed by successive reflection of a fundamental building block, which\r
we call unfolded domains, since transplantation of eigenfunctions is most simply done\r
between such domains. In order to make successive unfolding possible, each building\r
block is supposed to have three line segments at which the building block is reflected.\r
The domains shown in Figs 1 and 2 are the examples. Hereafter we denote N as the\r
number of building blocks composing the unfolded domain.\r
The whole shape of the unfolded domain is determined by the choice of the\r
building block and the rule specifying unfolding. The unfolding rule can be identified\r
with the edge-colored graph and the correspondence is given in table 1. Each\r
piece obtained by reflection is represented by the vertex of the graph, and the\r
reflecting segment by its edge. The three boundary segments of the building block\r
are distinguished by the color of the edges. Some boundary segments of the building\r
block form the boundary of the whole unfolded domain, and we represent the edge\r
corresponding to one of such boundary segments as the closed loop. An example of\r
edge-colored graph is demonstrated in Fig. 3.\r
Table 1.\r
unfolding rule edge-colored graph\r
pieces ←→ vertices\r
reflecting segments ←→ edges\r
kind of segment ←→ color of edge\r
The structure of a graph is also represented by the adjacency matrix. That is, the\r
reflecting rule to generate an unfolded domain P is given by the triplet of adjacency\r
matrices MP\r
a\r
, MP\r
b\r
, and MP\r
c defined as follows:\r
(MP\r

)\r
ij =\r
(\r

0 otherwise\r
. (6)\r
γ = a, b, c.\r
Diagonal element (MP\r
γ\r
)\r
ii is set to be 1 if the piece i has the boundary segment γ. The\r
adjacency matrix is, in general, not uniquely determined even if one fixed the graph\r
because there remains a freedom to determine the order of labeling vertices. In this

Here the permutation matrix is defined as a N ×N matrix in which each row or column\r
has only one unity, and all the other elements are zero. If the building block has some\r
symmetry, for example reflecting symmetry with respect to a certain axis, it might\r
happen that non-permutation matrix connects the congruent pair P and Q. However,\r
if one destructs the symmetry by changing the shape of the building block, such an\r
“accidental” situation can be avoided. The condition (7) for a permutation matrix U,\r
therefore, becomes the necessary and sufficient condition for the congruency of P and\r
Q in this sense.\r
Next we give the condition for transplantability of eigenfunction of two given\r
unfolded domains using the adjacency matrices. By transplantability we mean the\r
possibility that isospectrality of a pair of unfolded domains can be verified by the\r
transplantation method.\r
The transplantation procedure described in section 3 is explicitly expressed as\r
follows. Let P and Q be two unfolded domains composed of N copies of a common\r
building block. Let T : L\r
2\r
(P) ∋ f 7→ g ∈ L\r
2\r
(Q) be a linear transformation. We\r
say that the transformation T is a transplantation if the transform g is obtained by\r
cutting and pasting f, namely,\r
gi =\r
X\r
N\r
j=1\r
Tijfj, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, (8)\r
where fj and gi denote restrictions of f and g = T f to each piece, respectively. Also\r
as mentioned in section 2, it is not trivial at all that the transform g becomes an\r
eigenfunction on the transformed domain at this stage.\r
For given unfolded domains P and Q, we say that they are transplantable if there\r
exists an invertible transplantation T satisfying the following conditions:\r
TMP\r

a\r
, TMP\r
b T\r
−1 = MQ\r

c T\r

. (9)\r
It can be easily checked that smoothness on all the reflecting segments and the\r
boundary conditions on the unfolded domains are satisfied if the above conditions

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 7\r
are fulfilled. Here, existence of the inverse matrix T\r
−1\r
corresponds to the invertible\r
condition. The condition (9) is the one for transplantability of Neumann boundary\r
condition, but as remarked in section 2, it is equivalent to transplantability of the\r
Dirichlet case. As was seen in the previous section, P and Q are isospectral if they\r
are transplantable.\r
Note that if T is a permutation matrix, then P and Q are merely congruent.\r
Therefore, in order to construct isospectral but non-congruent pair of unfolded\r
domains, we must find a matrix satisfying the condition (9), but not a permutation\r
matrix."""

We next consider the length spectrum of the unfolded domain. The length spectrum\r
is the set of length of closed trajectories or periodic orbits on the billiard domain. We\r
first consider the relation between closed trajectories on the unfolded domain P and\r
its fundamental building block B. Note that any periodic orbit on P can be regarded\r
as the lift of a closed trajectory on B, because its projection is always a periodic orbit\r
on B. However, the converse is not necessarily true. A single closed orbit on B yields\r
N trajectories as its lift on the unfolded domain P, which are sometimes closed orbits\r
on P but the others not. By the construction of the adjacency matrix MP\r
γ\r
, it is easy\r
to see that the number of closed lifts of a given closed trajectory on B is counted as\r
n\r
P\r
(γ) = Tr(MP\r
γmMP\r
γm−1\r
· · · MP\r
γ1\r
), (10)\r
where γ = γ1γ2 · · · γm (γi = a, b, c) denotes the sequence representing in which order\r
a given closed trajectory on B hits the boundary segments (for example, see Fig.\r
4). Such a sequence is not determined uniquely for a given closed orbit. In fact, if\r
γ = γ1γ2 · · · γm is a sequence specifying some closed trajectory, then all sequences\r
obtained by its cyclic shift such as γ2 · · · γmγ1, γ3 · · · γmγ1γ2, etc. can be regarded as\r
the sequence giving to the same closed trajectory. However the number of closed lifts\r
is invariant because of the relation:\r
Tr(MP\r
γm\r
· · · MP\r
γ2MPγ1\r
) = Tr(MP\r
γ1MPγm\r

−1\r
)\r
= Tr(MP\r
γ1MPγm\r
· · · MP\r
γ2\r
)\r
= · · · .\r
(11)\r
Thus the length spectrum of closed trajectories for P is determined by the length\r
spectrum for B and n\r
P (γ).\r
In order that two unfolded domains P and Q constructed by the same-shaped\r
building block B have the same length spectrum, it is sufficient that the numbers of\r
closed lifts should coincide for all possible sequences of γ. It can easily be checked that\r
n\r
P (γ) and nQ(γ) are invariant if P and Q are transplantable, i.e., the condition (9)\r
is satisfied for the adjacent matrices of P and Q. Therefore we obtain the following\r
claim.\r
Proposition 1 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive\r
reflections of the same building block . If P and Q are transplantable, then n\r
P (γ) =\r
n\r
Q(γ) for any sequence γ, which leads to iso-length spectrality of P and Q.\r
The inverse of the above proposition is to inquire whether or not n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ)\r
gives the sufficient condition for transplantability. The following statement gives its

P (γ) is equal to 1.\r
answer: the condition n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) is precisely the analog of the transplantability\r
of eigenfunctions.\r
Proposition 2 Let P and Q be two unfolded domains obtained by N times successive\r
reflection of the same building block. If n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for any sequence γ, then P\r
and Q are transplantable, which leads to isospectrality of P and Q.\r
Proof We have shown that transplantability implies isospectrality in section 3. Here\r
we will show that transplantability follows from n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ). Let GP and GQ be\r
the groups generated by adjacency matrices:\r
G\r
P = hMP\r
a\r
, MP\r
b\r
, MP\r
c\r
i, GQ = hMQ\r
a\r
, MQ\r
b\r
, MQ\r
c\r
i. (12)\r
Since adjacency matrices themselves are also permutation matrices introduced in\r
section 4, GP and GQ are subgroups of the symmetric group SN , so they are finite.\r
Let F3 be a free group generated by characters a, b, and c. We can define surjective\r
homomorphism:\r
Φ\r
P\r
: F3 ∋ γ1γ2 . . . γm 7−→ MP\r
γmMP\r
γm−1\r
· · · MP\r
γ1\r
∈ G\r
P\r
, (13)\r
then GP is isomorphic to F3/ ker ΦP . GQ is also isomorphic to F3/ ker ΦQ.\r
We now assume that n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for any sequence γ, and note that MP\r
γ =\r
E ⇔ nP (γ) = N, where E denotes N × N identity matrix. Then we have\r
ker ΦP = {γ | MP\r
γ = E}\r
= {γ | nP (γ) = N}\r
= {γ | nQ(γ) = N}\r
= {γ | MQ\r
γ = E}.\r
= ker ΦQ\r

γ denote MPγmMPγm−1\r

and MQ\r

, respectively.\r
This means that GP is isomorphic to GQ. We can suppose identity maps:\r
ρ\r
P\r
: G\r
P → GL(N, C), ρQ : GQ → GL(N, C) (15)\r
to be linear representations of GP and GQ, respectively. Since GP is isomorphic to\r
GQ,\r
ρ : G\r
P ∋ MP\r
γ\r
7→ MQ\r
γ ∈ GL(N, C) (16)\r
is another linear representation of GP . Note that n\r
P (γ) and nQ(γ) become the\r
characters of representations ρ\r
P and ρ respectively, and they are equal by our\r
assumption. Character theory tells that two representations with the same character\r
are similar[11]. This means that there exists an invertible matrix T such that\r
TMP\r
γ = MQγ T for any γ (17)\r
This leads to transplantability between P and Q. (Q.E.D)\r
By propositions 1 and 2, we know equivalence between transplantability\r
and coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts, which are sufficient conditions\r
for isospectrality and iso-length spectrality respectively. However if we assume\r
transplantability, which is more strict condition than isospectrality, then iso-length\r
spectrality follows. Conversely, we assume coincidence of the numbers of closed lifts,\r
as a sufficient condition for iso-length spectrality, then isospectrality follows. Our\r
results can be summarized as the following schema.\r
isospectrality ⇐ transplantability\r
⇔ ∀γ nP(γ) = n\r
Q(γ)\r
⇒ iso-length spectrality"""

As an application of the above propositions, we enumerate isospectral pairs of unfolded\r
domains whose isospectrality can be verified by the transplantation method. The\r
candidate space we have to explore is the set UN which consists of all possible edge\u0002colored graphs without cycles, each of which represents an unfolding rule. The absence\r
of cycles guarantees for the unfolded domain to be formed flatly for any shaped building\r
block.\r
The advantage to use the propositions 1 and 2 (and their proof) is that even\r
for the purpose of listing up transplantable pairs(or triplets if possible), we do not\r
have to make pairwise comparisons. This is because we can regard each relation\r
n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) as a necessary condition for the transplantability of P and Q, and use\r
each relation as a “filter” to pick up transplantable candidates. More precise steps to\r
find out the transplantable pairs is as follows:\r
(i) For all edge-colored graphs P in UN , compute the character n\r
P (γ) for all possible\r
γ.\r
(ii) prepare the spectrum of characters {n\r
P (γ)} by ordering the character nP (γ)\r
according to an appropriate rule for γ (lexicographical order of sequence γ, for\r
example).\r
(iii) pick up the pair of edge-colored graphs whose character spectra are the same.

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 10\r
According to the proposition 2, if one finds the identical character spectra, i.e.,\r
{n\r
P (γ)} = {nQ(γ)}, they yield the transplantable pairs. One might be afraid that the\r
step (i), i.e., enumeration of the character spectrum seems to require infinite number\r
of steps, reflecting the fact that γ should run over all possible sequences composed of\r
a, b, c. However, this is not the case, since GP only forms a finite group as mentioned\r
in the proof of proposition 2.\r
It is interesting to note that coincidence of the “ground state”, i.e., n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ)\r
for null sequence of γ leads that the number of building blocks forming the unfolded\r
domains is equal, which can be read that the area of two domains are equal. Also the\r
condition for the “first exited state”, i.e., n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) where γ = a, b or c, gives\r
the condition for the length of the boundary to coincide. These geometrical quantities\r
agree with the first and second terms in the Weyl expansion respectively [1, 12, 13].\r

Applying the above procedure to the edge colored graphs up to N = 13, we have\r
enumerated all possible transplantable pairs, which are listed in Table 2. Fig. 5 shows\r
isospectral pairs ever known, which are listed in [9]. Our result completely agrees with\r
the list of known transplantable pairs presented in Fig. 5 at least up to N = 13. Note\r
that all 17 examples given in [9] have been generated based on the Sunada’s method."""

We have shown that transplantability of eigenfunctions on unfolded domains is\r
equivalent to coincidence of the character spectrum {n(γ)}. The former is a sufficient\r
condition for isospectrality and the latter for iso-length spectrality.\r
As mentioned in the introduction, if so-called almost conjugate condition (5) is\r
satisfied for a pair of subgroups H1 and H2, one knows that the quotients M/H1 and\r
M/H2 are isospectral, and iso-length spectrality of M/H1 and M/H2 simultaneously\r
follows. The first counter example of Kac’s original problem has been constructed\r
with this Sunada’s condition [7]. Once an isospectral pair is obtained based on such\r
a group theoretical argument together with the orbifold construction, one can easily\r
check isospectrality of the resulting pair using the transplantation method. In this way,\r
at the beginning, transplantation procedure serves only as a check or demonstration\r
for a given pair of domains to be really isospectral. It is uncertain whether or not there\r
exist transplantable pairs of domains which are not constructed based on the Sunada’s\r
condition, while the Sunada’s condition is a sufficient condition for transplantability.\r
However, by expressing an explicit condition (5) for transplantability using\r
adjacency matrices, one notices the similarity between the almost conjugate condition\r
(5) in Sunada’s theorem and the condition for existence of non permutation matrix T\r
in (9). Even if there exists an invertible matrix T satisfying (9), it is not necessarily

Equivalence between isospectrality and iso-length spectrality 11\r
true that they give an isospectral pair because they are congruent if T is merely\r
a permutation matrix. Such a situation reminds us of the case where the almost\r
conjugate condition (5) is satisfied but the subgroups H1 and H2 are conjugate, which\r
gives only an isometric pair.\r
Therefore it would become a natural question to inquire about the relation\r
between the Sunada’s construction of isospectral domains and the transplantation\r
method. Numerical enumeration attempted in section 5 elucidated that at least up to\r
N = 13 all the transplantable pairs are those pairs derived by Sunada’s method. This\r
suggests the possibility of its equivalence.\r
The condition n\r
P (γ) = nQ(γ) for all possible sequences of γ, which is\r
equivalent to transplantability of eigenfunctions, provides not only an efficient\r
algorithm to enumerate transplantable pairs of planar domains, but has an interesting\r
“geometrical” interpretation: Each n\r
P (γ) plays a role of the coefficient of Weyl\r
expansion as mentioned in section 5.\r
Transplantation method, on which we have relied in this paper, is available only\r
to the class of unfolded domains. Whether isospectrality is equivalent to iso-length\r
spectrality in more general domains is still an open problem.\r
