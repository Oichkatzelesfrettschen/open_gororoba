In this Letter we prove a simple theorem in quantum information theory, which implies that\r
bulk operators in the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence can\r
be reconstructed as CFT operators in a spatial subregion A, provided that they lie in its entan\u0002glement wedge. This is an improvement on existing reconstruction methods, which have at most\r
succeeded in the smaller causal wedge. The proof is a combination of the recent work of Jafferis,\r
Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh on the quantum relative entropy of a CFT subregion with earlier\r
ideas interpreting the correspondence as a quantum error correcting code.\r
INTRODUCTION\r
The AdS/CFT correspondence tells us that certain\r
large-N strongly-coupled CFTs define theories of quan\u0002tum gravity in asymptotically AdS space [1–6]. For this\r
definition to be complete, we need to know how to use\r
CFT language to ask any question of interest in the bulk.\r
The most basic items in this dictionary are:\r
• Quantum states in the Hilbert space of the CFT\r
correspond to quantum states in the bulk.\r
• The conformal and global symmetry generators in\r
the CFT correspond to the analogous asymptotic\r
symmetries in the bulk. For example the CFT\r
Hamiltonian maps to the ADM Hamiltonian, and\r
a U(1) charge maps to the electric flux at infinity.\r
• In the large N limit, any single-trace primary oper\u0002ator O(x) in the CFT, with scaling dimension ∆ of\r
order N0, corresponds to a bulk field φ(x, r). They\r
are related by the “extrapolate dictionary” [4, 7, 8]\r
O(x) = limr→∞r\r
∆φ(x, r). (1)\r
These give an excellent starting point for understanding\r
the correspondence, but the limiting procedure in the ex\u0002trapolate dictionary makes it difficult to concretely dis\u0002cuss what is going on deep within the bulk. There is a\r
good reason for this: although the CFT side of the du\u0002ality is defined exactly, the bulk side is ultimately some\r
nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity, which is only\r
approximately given by a semiclassical path integral over\r
local bulk fields. This means that any attempt to “back\r
off of the extrapolate dictionary” and formulate a CFT\r
representation of the bulk operator φ(x, r), usually called\r
a reconstruction, must itself be only an approximate no\u0002tion. Nonetheless, there is a standard algorithm for pro\u0002ducing such a φ(x, r) perturbatively in 1/N: one con\u0002structs it by solving the bulk equations of motion with\r
boundary conditions (1) [4, 9–14]. This algorithm has\r
the nice feature that it can be done quite explicitly, but\r
it has the disadvantage that it relies on solving a rather\r
nonstandard Cauchy problem [11, 15]. In this paper we\r
will refer to it as the HKLL procedure, after [9], who were\r
the first to study it in detail.\r
The HKLL procedure has the interesting property that\r
it also is sometimes able to reconstruct a bulk operator\r
φ(x, r) as a CFT operator with nontrivial support only\r
on some spatial subregion A of a boundary Cauchy slice\r
Σ [9, 14]. This is believed to occur whenever the point\r
(x, r) lies in the causal wedge of A, denoted CA.\r
1 CA is\r
defined as the intersection in the bulk of the bulk causal\r
future and past of the boundary domain of dependence\r
of A [16].\r
Causal wedge reconstruction via the HKLL procedure\r
gives an explicit illustration of “subregion-subregion du\u0002ality”, which is the notion that a spatial subregion A\r
in the boundary theory contains complete information\r
about some subregion of the bulk [15, 17, 18]. It has\r
been proposed however that the subregion dual to A is\r
not just CA, but rather a larger region: the entanglement\r
wedge EA [18–20]. To define the entanglement wedge, we\r
must first define the HRT surface χA [21] (the covariant\r
generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal [22]). χA\r
is defined as a codimension-two bulk surface of extremal\r
area, which has boundary ∂χA = ∂A and is homologous\r
to A through the bulk (in the event that multiple such\r
surfaces exist, it is the one with least area). The HRT\r
formula tells us that at leading order in 1/N, the area of\r
χA is proportional to the von Neumann entropy of the\r
region A in the CFT [21–23]. The entanglement wedge\r
EA is then defined as the bulk domain of dependence of\r
any achronal bulk surface whose boundary is A ∪ χA.\r
1 As mentioned above, this reconstruction relies on solving a non\u0002standard Cauchy problem [11, 15]. In general it is not known if\r
the solution really exists, but it can be found explicitly (in a dis\u0002tributional sense [14]) for the case of spherical boundary regions\r
in the vicinity of the AdS vacuum; in this case it is called the\r
AdS-Rindler reconstruction.\r

Recently, plausibility arguments for entanglement\r
wedge reconstruction have been developing along two dif\u0002ferent lines. [24] proposed a re-interpretation of causal\r
wedge reconstruction as quantum error correction, which\r
is a structure that very naturally allows an extension to\r
entanglement wedge reconstruction. This was explicitly\r
realized in toy models [25, 26]. At the same time it has\r
gradually been understood that a proposal [27] for the\r
first 1/N correction to the HRT formula is indicative\r
that entanglement wedge reconstruction should be possi\u0002ble [24, 28, 29]. In particular Jafferis, Lewkowycz, Mal\u0002dacena, and Suh (JLMS) have given a remarkable bulk\r
formula for the modular Hamiltonian associated to any\r
CFT region, which implies that the relative entropy of\r
two states in a boundary spatial region A is simply equal\r
to the relative entropy of the two bulk states in EA [29].\r
The purpose of this paper is to tie all of these ideas to\u0002gether into a proof that entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion is in fact possible in AdS/CFT: given a boundary\r
subregion A, all bulk operators in EA have CFT recon\u0002structions as operators in A.\r
ENTANGLEMENT WEDGE RECONSTRUCTION\r
AS QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION\r
We mentioned above that the holographic nature of\r
AdS/CFT prevents bulk operator reconstruction from\r
being a precise notion. This reveals itself not just in\r
the perturbative nature of the the HKLL algorithm, but\r
also in its regime of validity. As one acts with more\r
and more reconstructed operators in a region, the thresh\u0002old for black hole formation is eventually crossed. This\r
leads to a breakdown of the construction. In [24] this\r
was formalized into the notion that one should think of\r
reconstructed bulk operators as only making sense in a\r
code subspace of the CFT Hilbert space, which we denote\r
Hcode. The choice of this subspace is not unique, since\r
in general we can choose to define it based on whatever\r
observables we are interested in studying, but the sim\u0002plest thing to do is choose a state which we know has a\r
geometric interpretation, and then consider the subspace\r
of all states where the backreaction of the metric about\r
that geometry is perturbatively small.2\r
As a concrete example, we can consider the subspace\r
of states of the CFT on a sphere whose energy is less\r
than that of a Planck-sized black hole in the center of\r
the bulk, together with the image of this subspace under\r
the conformal group. For example in the N = 4 super\r
2 This is an overly conservative definition of the code subspace,\r
since a certain amount of backreaction (such as that present in\r
the solar system) can be included by resumming subclasses of\r
diagrams in the perturbative expansion [11, 30]. We adopt it\r
nonetheless to simplify our arguments below.\r
FIG. 1. Factorizing the bulk and boundary on a time slice.\r
The entanglement wedge EA is shaded. For simplicity we have\r
shown a connected boundary region A, although this might\r
not be the case.\r
Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N), and with\r
gauge coupling g ∼ 1 to equate the string and Planck\r
scales, this corresponds to the set of primary operators\r
whose dimensions are . N1/4, together with their con\u0002formal descendants. If the duality is correct, meaning\r
that correlation functions of local boundary operators in\r
these states can be reproduced by bulk Feynman-Witten\r
diagrams with some effective action,3then the machinery\r
of [4, 9–14] enables us to explicitly reconstruct all low\u0002energy bulk operators φ(x, r) in such a way that their\r
correlation functions in any state in the code subspace\r
agree with those computed in bulk effective field theory\r
with that effective action to all orders in 1/N. For this to\r
work in detail we must choose some sort of covariant UV\r
cutoff in the bulk, but we will not discuss this explicitly\r
in what follows.\r
We can now describe entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion. Say that we split a Cauchy slice Σ of the boundary\r
CFT into a region A and its complement A. The CFT\r
Hilbert space has a tensor factorization as\r
HCF T = HA ⊗ HA. (2)\r
Similarly we can think of the code subspace as factorizing\r
as\r
Hcode = Ha ⊗ Ha , (3)\r
where Ha denotes the Hilbert space of bulk excitations\r
in EA, and Ha denotes the Hilbert space of bulk excita\u0002tions in EA\r
. We illustrate this in Figure 1. Both tensor\r
factorizations are complicated by the fact that gauge con\u0002straints might be present [31–38], but likely this problem\r
can be absorbed into the choice of UV cutoff (as shown\r
for U(1) gauge fields by [39]). We could dispense with\r
this issue by formulating our arguments in terms of sub\u0002algebras instead of subfactors, see [32] for the relevant\r
3 See [6] for a discussion of which CFTs have this property, and\r
also for how to determine the effective action in terms of CFT\r
data if they do.

3\r
definitions, but we have opted for the latter for familiar\u0002ity.\r
Entanglement wedge reconstruction is then the state\u0002ment that any bulk operator Oa acting within Ha can\r
always be represented in the CFT with an operator OA\r
that has support only on HA. In fact this is the precise\r
definition of the idea that the operator Oa can be “cor\u0002rected” for the erasure of the region A [40], and the obser\u0002vation that a given Oa can be reconstructed on different\r
choices of A reflects the ability of the code to correct for\r
a variety of erasures [24]. We will establish the existence\r
of OA below, but first we need to review a recent result\r
that will be essential for the proof.\r
REVIEW OF THE JLMS ARGUMENT\r
In [29], JLMS argued for an equivalence of relative en\u0002tropy between bulk and boundary. In this section we\r
give a more detailed derivation of this result, which also\r
extends it to higher orders in the semiclassical expansion\r
given an assumption we state precisely below. Let us\r
first recall that the von Neumann entropy of any state is\r
defined as\r
S(ρ) ≡ −Tr (ρ log ρ) , (4)\r
its modular Hamiltonian is defined as\r
Kρ ≡ − log ρ , (5)\r
and the relative entropy of a state ρ to a state σ is\r
S(ρ|σ) ≡ Tr (ρ log ρ) − Tr (ρ log σ) = −S(ρ) + Tr (ρKσ) .\r
(6)\r
Relative entropy is non-negative, and vanishes if and only\r
if ρ = σ. Under small perturbations of the state, the en\u0002tropy and modular Hamiltonian are related by the “first\r
law of entanglement”:4\r
S(ρ + δρ) − S(ρ) = Tr (δρ Kρ) + O(δρ2). (7)\r
Now consider the setup of the previous section, where\r
in some holographic CFT we pick a code subspace\r
Hcode = Ha ⊗ Ha in which effective field theory per\u0002turbatively coupled to gravity is valid, and in which all\r
states can be derived from path integral constructions\r
in this effective theory. Following JLMS, we recall that\r
Faulkner et al. [27] showed that such states5 ρ obey\r
S(ρA) = S(ρa) + Tr (ρaAloc) . (8)\r
4 This is derived in e.g. [41, 42] by linearizing the entropy.\r
To deal with possible non-commutativity of ρ and δρ one\r
can use the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and recall that\r
Tr (A[B, C]) = 0 if A and B are simultaneously diagonalizable.\r
5 The argument of [27], like the earlier classical argument [23],\r
assumes that the von Neumann entropy can be found by an ana\u0002Here Aloc denotes a bulk operator that is a local integral\r
over the HRT surface χA. At leading order in 1/N, or\r
equivalently at leading order in the gravitational coupling\r
G, we have\r
Aloc =\r
Area(χA)\r
4G\r
, (9)\r
as required by the HRT formula, but Aloc receives correc\u0002tions at higher orders in 1/N [27, 44], or in the presence\r
of more general gravitational interactions [45–55].\r
In fact [27] only established (8) to order N0. In [56] it\r
was suggested that (8) continues to hold to all orders in\r
1/N, provided that one always defines χA to be extremal\r
with respect to the sum on the right hand side of (8)\r
(sometimes called the “generalized entropy”); such a χA\r
is known as a quantum extremal surface. We will assume\r
this to be the case throughout the code subspace in what\r
follows: if it is not then our arguments only establish\r
entanglement wedge reconstruction to order N0.\r
To establish the JLMS result, we now observe that\r
linearizing (8) about σ and using the first law (7), we\r
have\r
Tr (δσAKσA ) = Tr \u0010δσa\r
\u0010\r
A\r
{σ}\r
loc + Kσa\r
\u0011\u0011 . (10)\r
Here we have taken δσ to be an arbitrary perturbation\r
that acts within the code subspace Hcode. We have writ\u0002ten A\r
{σ}\r
loc to emphasize that Aloc is still located at the\r
surface defined by extremizing S(σa) + Aloc. (10) is lin\u0002ear in δσ, so we can integrate it to obtain\r
Tr (ρAKσA ) = Tr \u0010ρ\r
{σ}\r
a\r
\u0010\r
A\r
{σ}\r
loc + Kσa\r
\u0011\u0011 , (11)\r
where now ρ and σ are arbitrary states acting within\r
Hcode. We have written ρ\r
{σ}\r
a to clarify that we are still\r
factorizing the bulk Hilbert space at the quantum ex\u0002tremal surface for σ, even though we are now considering\r
another state ρ as well. Since (11) holds for any ρ acting\r
within Hcode, it implies that\r
ΠcKσA Πc = Kσa + A\r
{σ}\r
loc , (12)\r
where Πc is the projection operator onto the code sub\u0002space, and where we have defined the operators on the\r
right hand side to annihilate H⊥\r
code. This is one of the\r
main results of [29].\r
lytic continuation of certain “Renyi entropies” Tr(ρ\r
n), and that\r
the bulk path integral for calculating the n-th Renyi entropy does\r
not spontaneously break the associated Zn symmetry. There is\r
also some subtlety in applying the argument to states that do not\r
possess a moment of time-reflection symmetry, but this seems to\r
just be a matter of convenience, and an argument that dispenses\r
with this criterion will appear elsewhere soon [43].

4\r
Moreover combining (6), (8), and (11), we find that\r
S(ρA|σA) =S(ρ\r
{σ}\r
a\r
|σa)\r
+\r
h\r
Tr \u0010ρ\r
{σ}\r
a A\r
{σ}\r
loc \u0011\r
− Tr \u0010ρ\r
{ρ}\r
a A\r
{ρ}\r
loc \u0011\r
+ S\r
\u0010\r
ρ\r
{σ}\r
a\r
\u0011\r
− S\r
\u0010\r
ρ\r
{ρ}\r
a\r
\u0011 i . (13)\r
To order N0the terms in square brackets cancel due to\r
the extremality of χ\r
{ρ}\r
A with respect to S(ρa) + Aloc, so\r
we find the equivalence of relative entropies which is the\r
other main result of [29].6\r
More generally, we find that the relative entropies dif\u0002fer by the difference of generalized entropies of ρ on the\r
two quantum extremal surfaces χ\r
{ρ}\r
A and χ\r
{σ}\r
A . In either\r
case, we observe that if ρa\r
{σ} = σa, then (13) implies\r
S(ρA|σA) = 0, and thus ρA = σA. This is the result that\r
we will use in the proof below.\r
By symmetry, the results (13),(12) apply also for the\r
complement regions A and a, although for a mixed state\r
one must use S(ρa) rather than S(ρa) when extremizing\r
to find χA\r
.\r
7\r
At order N0it is intuitively clear that (13) says that we\r
must be able to reconstruct in the entanglement wedge.\r
Relative entropy is a measure of the distinguishability of\r
two quantum states, so we can only have (13) if ρA, σA\r
have just as much information about the bulk as ρa, σa.\r
We now prove a theorem that makes this precise, and\r
extends it to higher orders in 1/N given the proposal of\r
[56].\r
A RECONSTRUCTION THEOREM\r
Theorem. Let H be a finite-dimensional Hilbert space,\r
H = HA ⊗ HA\r
be a tensor factorization, and Hcode be a\r
subspace of H. Let O be an operator that, together with\r
its Hermitian conjugate, acts within Hcode. If for any\r
two pure states |φi, |ψi ∈ Hcode, there exists a tensor\r
factorization Hcode = Ha ⊗ Ha such that O acts only on\r
Ha, and the reduced density matrices\r
ρA ≡ TrA|φihφ| , σA ≡ TrA|ψihψ| ,\r
ρa ≡ Tra|φihφ| , σa ≡ Tra|ψihψ| (14)\r
satisfy\r
ρa = σa ⇒ ρA = σA\r
, (15)\r
then both of the following statements are true:\r
6 This equivalence is complicated by gravitons, which are metric\r
variations of order √\r
G and thus can produce second-order varia\u0002tions of order N0\r
. These can be dispensed with by introducing a\r
gauge (e.g. the one in [29]) where the quantum extremal surface\r
χA does not move until order N0.\r
7\r
In this case, we expect that the two entanglement wedges can\r
never overlap.\r
1. For any XAacting on HAand any state |φi ∈\r
Hcode, we have\r
hφ|[O, XA\r
]|φi = 0 . (16)\r
2. There exists an operator OA acting just on HA such\r
that OA and O have the same action on Hcode, i.e.\r
OA|φi = O|φi, O†\r
A|φi = O\r
†\r
|φi, (17)\r
for any state |φi ∈ Hcode.\r
Proof. First we note that the two statements are guaran\u0002teed to be equivalent by the theorem proved in Appendix\r
B of [24]; for the convenience of the reader we sketch the\r
logic of that proof in an appendix below. Therefore we\r
will only need to prove the first statement. Furthermore\r
it is sufficient to prove the theorem when O is a Hermi\u0002tian operator which we assume now.8\r
Consider any state |φi ∈ Hcode, and let λ be an arbi\u0002trary real number. For the two states |φi and\r
|ψi ≡ e\r
iλO|φi (18)\r
which are both in Hcode, the assumption of the theorem\r
guarantees the existence of a tensor factorization Hcode =\r
Ha ⊗ Ha such that O acts only on Ha, which implies\r
ρa = σa (19)\r
because the two states only differ by the action of a uni\u0002tary operator e\r
iλO on Ha. Using (15) we find\r
ρA = σA ⇒ hψ|XA|ψi = hφ|XA|φi. (20)\r
Using (18) we may rewrite (20) as\r
hφ|e\r
−iλOXA\r
e\r
iλO|φi − hφ|XA\r
|φi = 0 . (21)\r
Expanding this equation to linear order in λ, we find\r
hφ|[O, XA]|φi = 0 , (22)\r
which proves (16), and hence also (17).\r
In the above theorem we assumed that H is finite\u0002dimensional to avoid any subtleties with the proof of Ap\u0002pendix B of [24]. In AdS/CFT we can accomplish this\r
by introducing a UV cutoff in the CFT. This only affects\r
physics near the asymptotic boundary of AdS, and there\u0002fore is not essential to our discussion. In bulk language\r
the assumptions for the theorem follow from picking an\r
O that lies in the entanglement wedge EA for any state in\r
Hcode, with the choice of factorization coming from the\r
quantum extremal surface for the state |φi. This ensures\r
that we can apply eq. (13) for the complement region A,\r
which then implies (15).\r
8 To see this, we recall that any operator is a (complex) linear\r
combination of two Hermitian operators.

DISCUSSION\r
We view the theorem of the previous section as estab\u0002lishing the existence of entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion. Several comments are in order:\r
Our argument ultimately rests on the validity of the\r
quantum version (8) of the HRT formula, derived to order\r
N0 by [27], and conjecturally extended to higher orders\r
in 1/N by [56]. Understanding those results better is thus\r
clearly of interest for bulk reconstruction. Any discussion\r
of bulk reconstruction will ultimately be approximate, so\r
it would be interesting to prove an approximate version\r
of our theorem and use it to clarify the stability of our\r
results under small perturbations.\r
Note that our proof is constructive. After establishing\r
the assumptions of the theorem of Appendix B in [24]\r
hold, that theorem provides an explicit formula for the\r
reconstruction OA. Our construction is thus an improve\u0002ment on the HKLL procedure even within the causal\r
wedge, since the nonstandard Cauchy problem involved\r
in causal wedge reconstruction has only been solved in\r
special cases. However, it does not give much insight\r
into how to think about the reconstruction from a bulk\r
point of view. This is to be contrasted with the HKLL\r
algorithm, which (at least when it works) proceeds by\r
solving bulk equations of motion. We believe that a bulk\r
interpretation should exist, and finding it could be quite\r
illuminating.\r

Appendix: Theorem of Operator Algebra Quantum\r
Error Correction\r
In this appendix, we give an intuitive summary of the\r
derivation of the theorem establishing the equivalence be\u0002tween (16) and (17). More details can be found in the\r
full proof provided in Appendix B of [24].\r
Suppose that Hcode is spanned by an orthonormal basis\r
|iiAA. Consider the state\r
|Φi =\r
X\r
i\r
|iiR ⊗ |iiAA\r
, (23)\r
where R is a reference system whose Hilbert space is\r
spanned by an orthonormal basis |iiR. Using (23) we may\r
mirror any operator O acting within Hcode to an operator\r
OR on R such that O|Φi = OR|Φi, O†|Φi = O\r
†\r
R|Φi.\r
The task is then to instead view OR as OR ⊗ IA\r
and\r
mirror it back to an operator OA on A. To do this we\r
need the Schmidt decomposition\r
|Φi =\r
X\r
α\r
cα|αiA ⊗ |αiRA, (24)\r
where the states |αiRA with cα 6= 0 generally span a\r
subspace of HR ⊗ HA. We can mirror OR ⊗ IAonto A if\r
it acts within this subspace which is guaranteed by\r
[OR ⊗ IA, ρRA(Φ)] = 0 . (25)\r
This statement is implied by (16). Therefore we obtain\r
(17).\r

Reconstruction of Bulk Operators within the Entanglement Wedge\r
in Gauge-Gravity Duality\r

In this Letter we prove a simple theorem in quantum information theory, which implies that\r
bulk operators in the Anti-de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence can\r
be reconstructed as CFT operators in a spatial subregion A, provided that they lie in its entan\u0002glement wedge. This is an improvement on existing reconstruction methods, which have at most\r
succeeded in the smaller causal wedge. The proof is a combination of the recent work of Jafferis,\r
Lewkowycz, Maldacena, and Suh on the quantum relative entropy of a CFT subregion with earlier\r
ideas interpreting the correspondence as a quantum error correcting code.\r
INTRODUCTION\r
The AdS/CFT correspondence tells us that certain\r
large-N strongly-coupled CFTs define theories of quan\u0002tum gravity in asymptotically AdS space [1–6]. For this\r
definition to be complete, we need to know how to use\r
CFT language to ask any question of interest in the bulk.\r
The most basic items in this dictionary are:\r
• Quantum states in the Hilbert space of the CFT\r
correspond to quantum states in the bulk.\r
• The conformal and global symmetry generators in\r
the CFT correspond to the analogous asymptotic\r
symmetries in the bulk. For example the CFT\r
Hamiltonian maps to the ADM Hamiltonian, and\r
a U(1) charge maps to the electric flux at infinity.\r
• In the large N limit, any single-trace primary oper\u0002ator O(x) in the CFT, with scaling dimension ∆ of\r
order N0, corresponds to a bulk field φ(x, r). They\r
are related by the “extrapolate dictionary” [4, 7, 8]\r
O(x) = limr→∞r\r
∆φ(x, r). (1)\r
These give an excellent starting point for understanding\r
the correspondence, but the limiting procedure in the ex\u0002trapolate dictionary makes it difficult to concretely dis\u0002cuss what is going on deep within the bulk. There is a\r
good reason for this: although the CFT side of the du\u0002ality is defined exactly, the bulk side is ultimately some\r
nonperturbative theory of quantum gravity, which is only\r
approximately given by a semiclassical path integral over\r
local bulk fields. This means that any attempt to “back\r
off of the extrapolate dictionary” and formulate a CFT\r
representation of the bulk operator φ(x, r), usually called\r
a reconstruction, must itself be only an approximate no\u0002tion. Nonetheless, there is a standard algorithm for pro\u0002ducing such a φ(x, r) perturbatively in 1/N: one con\u0002structs it by solving the bulk equations of motion with\r
boundary conditions (1) [4, 9–14]. This algorithm has\r
the nice feature that it can be done quite explicitly, but\r
it has the disadvantage that it relies on solving a rather\r
nonstandard Cauchy problem [11, 15]. In this paper we\r
will refer to it as the HKLL procedure, after [9], who were\r
the first to study it in detail.\r
The HKLL procedure has the interesting property that\r
it also is sometimes able to reconstruct a bulk operator\r
φ(x, r) as a CFT operator with nontrivial support only\r
on some spatial subregion A of a boundary Cauchy slice\r
Σ [9, 14]. This is believed to occur whenever the point\r
(x, r) lies in the causal wedge of A, denoted CA."""

defined as the intersection in the bulk of the bulk causal\r
future and past of the boundary domain of dependence\r
of A [16].\r
Causal wedge reconstruction via the HKLL procedure\r
gives an explicit illustration of “subregion-subregion du\u0002ality”, which is the notion that a spatial subregion A\r
in the boundary theory contains complete information\r
about some subregion of the bulk [15, 17, 18]. It has\r
been proposed however that the subregion dual to A is\r
not just CA, but rather a larger region: the entanglement\r
wedge EA [18–20]. To define the entanglement wedge, we\r
must first define the HRT surface χA [21] (the covariant\r
generalization of the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal [22]). χA\r
is defined as a codimension-two bulk surface of extremal\r
area, which has boundary ∂χA = ∂A and is homologous\r
to A through the bulk (in the event that multiple such\r
surfaces exist, it is the one with least area). The HRT\r
formula tells us that at leading order in 1/N, the area of\r
χA is proportional to the von Neumann entropy of the\r
region A in the CFT [21–23]. The entanglement wedge\r
EA is then defined as the bulk domain of dependence of\r
any achronal bulk surface whose boundary is A ∪ χA.\r
1 As mentioned above, this reconstruction relies on solving a non\u0002standard Cauchy problem [11, 15]. In general it is not known if\r
the solution really exists, but it can be found explicitly (in a dis\u0002tributional sense [14]) for the case of spherical boundary regions\r
in the vicinity of the AdS vacuum; in this case it is called the\r
AdS-Rindler reconstruction.\r

wedge reconstruction have been developing along two dif\u0002ferent lines. [24] proposed a re-interpretation of causal\r
wedge reconstruction as quantum error correction, which\r
is a structure that very naturally allows an extension to\r
entanglement wedge reconstruction. This was explicitly\r
realized in toy models [25, 26]. At the same time it has\r
gradually been understood that a proposal [27] for the\r
first 1/N correction to the HRT formula is indicative\r
that entanglement wedge reconstruction should be possi\u0002ble [24, 28, 29]. In particular Jafferis, Lewkowycz, Mal\u0002dacena, and Suh (JLMS) have given a remarkable bulk\r
formula for the modular Hamiltonian associated to any\r
CFT region, which implies that the relative entropy of\r
two states in a boundary spatial region A is simply equal\r
to the relative entropy of the two bulk states in EA [29].\r
The purpose of this paper is to tie all of these ideas to\u0002gether into a proof that entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion is in fact possible in AdS/CFT: given a boundary\r
subregion A, all bulk operators in EA have CFT recon\u0002structions as operators in A.\r
ENTANGLEMENT WEDGE RECONSTRUCTION\r
AS QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION\r
We mentioned above that the holographic nature of\r
AdS/CFT prevents bulk operator reconstruction from\r
being a precise notion. This reveals itself not just in\r
the perturbative nature of the the HKLL algorithm, but\r
also in its regime of validity. As one acts with more\r
and more reconstructed operators in a region, the thresh\u0002old for black hole formation is eventually crossed. This\r
leads to a breakdown of the construction. In [24] this\r
was formalized into the notion that one should think of\r
reconstructed bulk operators as only making sense in a\r
code subspace of the CFT Hilbert space, which we denote\r
Hcode. The choice of this subspace is not unique, since\r
in general we can choose to define it based on whatever\r
observables we are interested in studying, but the sim\u0002plest thing to do is choose a state which we know has a\r
geometric interpretation, and then consider the subspace\r
of all states where the backreaction of the metric about\r
that geometry is perturbatively small.2\r
As a concrete example, we can consider the subspace\r
of states of the CFT on a sphere whose energy is less\r
than that of a Planck-sized black hole in the center of\r
the bulk, together with the image of this subspace under\r
the conformal group. For example in the N = 4 super"""

since a certain amount of backreaction (such as that present in\r
the solar system) can be included by resumming subclasses of\r
diagrams in the perturbative expansion [11, 30]. We adopt it\r
nonetheless to simplify our arguments below.\r
FIG. 1. Factorizing the bulk and boundary on a time slice.\r
The entanglement wedge EA is shaded. For simplicity we have\r
shown a connected boundary region A, although this might\r
not be the case.\r
Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N), and with\r
gauge coupling g ∼ 1 to equate the string and Planck\r
scales, this corresponds to the set of primary operators\r
whose dimensions are . N1/4, together with their con\u0002formal descendants. If the duality is correct, meaning\r
that correlation functions of local boundary operators in\r
these states can be reproduced by bulk Feynman-Witten\r
diagrams with some effective action,3then the machinery\r
of [4, 9–14] enables us to explicitly reconstruct all low\u0002energy bulk operators φ(x, r) in such a way that their\r
correlation functions in any state in the code subspace\r
agree with those computed in bulk effective field theory\r
with that effective action to all orders in 1/N. For this to\r
work in detail we must choose some sort of covariant UV\r
cutoff in the bulk, but we will not discuss this explicitly\r
in what follows.\r
We can now describe entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion. Say that we split a Cauchy slice Σ of the boundary\r
CFT into a region A and its complement A. The CFT\r
Hilbert space has a tensor factorization as\r
HCF T = HA ⊗ HA. (2)\r
Similarly we can think of the code subspace as factorizing\r
as\r
Hcode = Ha ⊗ Ha , (3)\r
where Ha denotes the Hilbert space of bulk excitations\r
in EA, and Ha denotes the Hilbert space of bulk excita\u0002tions in EA\r
. We illustrate this in Figure 1. Both tensor\r
factorizations are complicated by the fact that gauge con\u0002straints might be present [31–38], but likely this problem\r
can be absorbed into the choice of UV cutoff (as shown\r
for U(1) gauge fields by [39]). We could dispense with\r
this issue by formulating our arguments in terms of sub\u0002algebras instead of subfactors, see [32] for the relevant"""

definitions, but we have opted for the latter for familiar\u0002ity.\r
Entanglement wedge reconstruction is then the state\u0002ment that any bulk operator Oa acting within Ha can\r
always be represented in the CFT with an operator OA\r
that has support only on HA. In fact this is the precise\r
definition of the idea that the operator Oa can be “cor\u0002rected” for the erasure of the region A [40], and the obser\u0002vation that a given Oa can be reconstructed on different\r
choices of A reflects the ability of the code to correct for\r
a variety of erasures [24]. We will establish the existence\r
of OA below, but first we need to review a recent result\r
that will be essential for the proof.\r
REVIEW OF THE JLMS ARGUMENT\r
In [29], JLMS argued for an equivalence of relative en\u0002tropy between bulk and boundary. In this section we\r
give a more detailed derivation of this result, which also\r
extends it to higher orders in the semiclassical expansion\r
given an assumption we state precisely below. Let us\r
first recall that the von Neumann entropy of any state is\r
defined as\r
S(ρ) ≡ −Tr (ρ log ρ) , (4)\r
its modular Hamiltonian is defined as\r
Kρ ≡ − log ρ , (5)\r
and the relative entropy of a state ρ to a state σ is\r
S(ρ|σ) ≡ Tr (ρ log ρ) − Tr (ρ log σ) = −S(ρ) + Tr (ρKσ) .\r
(6)\r
Relative entropy is non-negative, and vanishes if and only\r
if ρ = σ. Under small perturbations of the state, the en\u0002tropy and modular Hamiltonian are related by the “first\r
law of entanglement”:4\r
S(ρ + δρ) − S(ρ) = Tr (δρ Kρ) + O(δρ2). (7)\r
Now consider the setup of the previous section, where\r
in some holographic CFT we pick a code subspace\r
Hcode = Ha ⊗ Ha in which effective field theory per\u0002turbatively coupled to gravity is valid, and in which all\r
states can be derived from path integral constructions\r
in this effective theory. Following JLMS, we recall that\r
Faulkner et al. [27] showed that such states5 ρ obey\r
S(ρA) = S(ρa) + Tr (ρaAloc) . (8)"""

Aloc =\r
Area(χA)\r
4G\r
, (9)\r
as required by the HRT formula, but Aloc receives correc\u0002tions at higher orders in 1/N [27, 44], or in the presence\r
of more general gravitational interactions [45–55].\r
In fact [27] only established (8) to order N0. In [56] it\r
was suggested that (8) continues to hold to all orders in\r
1/N, provided that one always defines χA to be extremal\r
with respect to the sum on the right hand side of (8)\r
(sometimes called the “generalized entropy”); such a χA\r
is known as a quantum extremal surface. We will assume\r
this to be the case throughout the code subspace in what\r
follows: if it is not then our arguments only establish\r
entanglement wedge reconstruction to order N0.\r

just be a matter of convenience, and an argument that dispenses\r
with this criterion will appear elsewhere soon [43]."""

OA|φi = O|φi, O†\r
A|φi = O\r
†\r
|φi, (17)\r
for any state |φi ∈ Hcode.\r
Proof. First we note that the two statements are guaran\u0002teed to be equivalent by the theorem proved in Appendix\r
B of [24]; for the convenience of the reader we sketch the\r
logic of that proof in an appendix below. Therefore we\r
will only need to prove the first statement. Furthermore\r
it is sufficient to prove the theorem when O is a Hermi\u0002tian operator which we assume now.8\r
Consider any state |φi ∈ Hcode, and let λ be an arbi\u0002trary real number. For the two states |φi and\r
|ψi ≡ e\r
iλO|φi (18)\r
which are both in Hcode, the assumption of the theorem\r
guarantees the existence of a tensor factorization Hcode =\r
Ha ⊗ Ha such that O acts only on Ha, which implies\r
ρa = σa (19)\r
because the two states only differ by the action of a uni\u0002tary operator e\r
iλO on Ha. Using (15) we find\r
ρA = σA ⇒ hψ|XA|ψi = hφ|XA|φi. (20)\r
Using (18) we may rewrite (20) as\r
hφ|e\r
−iλOXA\r
e\r
iλO|φi − hφ|XA\r
|φi = 0 . (21)\r
Expanding this equation to linear order in λ, we find\r
hφ|[O, XA]|φi = 0 , (22)\r
which proves (16), and hence also (17).\r
In the above theorem we assumed that H is finite\u0002dimensional to avoid any subtleties with the proof of Ap\u0002pendix B of [24]. In AdS/CFT we can accomplish this\r
by introducing a UV cutoff in the CFT. This only affects\r
physics near the asymptotic boundary of AdS, and there\u0002fore is not essential to our discussion. In bulk language\r
the assumptions for the theorem follow from picking an\r
O that lies in the entanglement wedge EA for any state in\r
Hcode, with the choice of factorization coming from the\r
quantum extremal surface for the state |φi. This ensures\r
that we can apply eq. (13) for the complement region A,\r
which then implies (15)."""

text = """
We view the theorem of the previous section as estab\u0002lishing the existence of entanglement wedge reconstruc\u0002tion. Several comments are in order:\r
Our argument ultimately rests on the validity of the\r
quantum version (8) of the HRT formula, derived to order\r
N0 by [27], and conjecturally extended to higher orders\r
in 1/N by [56]. Understanding those results better is thus\r
clearly of interest for bulk reconstruction. Any discussion\r
of bulk reconstruction will ultimately be approximate, so\r
it would be interesting to prove an approximate version\r
of our theorem and use it to clarify the stability of our\r
results under small perturbations.\r
Note that our proof is constructive. After establishing\r
the assumptions of the theorem of Appendix B in [24]\r
hold, that theorem provides an explicit formula for the\r
reconstruction OA. Our construction is thus an improve\u0002ment on the HKLL procedure even within the causal\r
wedge, since the nonstandard Cauchy problem involved\r
in causal wedge reconstruction has only been solved in\r
special cases. However, it does not give much insight\r
into how to think about the reconstruction from a bulk\r
point of view. This is to be contrasted with the HKLL\r
algorithm, which (at least when it works) proceeds by\r
solving bulk equations of motion. We believe that a bulk\r
interpretation should exist, and finding it could be quite\r
illuminating.\r

Appendix: Theorem of Operator Algebra Quantum\r
Error Correction\r
In this appendix, we give an intuitive summary of the\r
derivation of the theorem establishing the equivalence be\u0002tween (16) and (17). More details can be found in the\r
full proof provided in Appendix B of [24].\r
Suppose that Hcode is spanned by an orthonormal basis\r
|iiAA. Consider the state\r
|Φi =\r
X\r
i\r
|iiR ⊗ |iiAA\r
, (23)\r
where R is a reference system whose Hilbert space is\r
spanned by an orthonormal basis |iiR. Using (23) we may\r
mirror any operator O acting within Hcode to an operator\r
OR on R such that O|Φi = OR|Φi, O†|Φi = O\r
†\r
R|Φi.\r
The task is then to instead view OR as OR ⊗ IA\r
and\r
mirror it back to an operator OA on A. To do this we\r
need the Schmidt decomposition\r
|Φi =\r
X\r
α\r
cα|αiA ⊗ |αiRA, (24)\r
where the states |αiRA with cα 6= 0 generally span a\r
subspace of HR ⊗ HA. We can mirror OR ⊗ IAonto A if\r
it acts within this subspace which is guaranteed by\r
[OR ⊗ IA, ρRA(Φ)] = 0 . (25)\r
This statement is implied by (16). Therefore we obtain\r
(17).\r
