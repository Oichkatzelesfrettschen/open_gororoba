Abstract\r
We calculate the black hole entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity as a\r
function of the horizon area and provide the exact formula for the\r
leading and sub-leading terms. By comparison with the Bekenstein–\r
Hawking formula we uniquely fix the value of the ’quantum of area’\r
in the theory.\r
The Bekenstein–Hawking formula gives the leading term in the entropy\r
of the black hole in the form\r
S =\r
1\r
4\r
A\r
l\r
2\r
P\r
(1)\r
where lP is the Planck length and A is the black hole horizon area. According\r
to the common belief, the entropy is always connected with the logarithm of\r
the number of microscopic states realizing a given macroscopic state. The\r
fact that the entropy in (1) is proportional to the area (and not as is usual to\r
the volume) has led to the formulation of the so called holographic principle.\r
It was however difficult to find the microscopic states that could account for\r
such an entropy.\r
The problem was attacked in two different approaches – in string theory\r
[1]-[5] and in Loop Quantum Gravity [6]-[10] (see also the review [11]). The\r
latter approach is based on a quantum theory of geometry. The basic ge\u0002ometric operators were introduced in [12, 13] and a detailed description of\r
the quantum horizon geometry was introduced using the U(1) Chern-Simons\r
theory in [10] where one can find the detailed discussion of the states on the\r
horizon of the black hole (see also [14]). However, the procedure introduced\r
in [10] for state counting contained a spurious constraint on admissible se\u0002quences and the number of the relevant horizon states is underestimated.\r
The correct method of counting was proposed in [14] but that analysis pro\u0002vides only lower and upper bounds on the number of states. The purpose\r
of this paper is to rectify this situation. We will provide the correct value\r
1

of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter that is needed to obtain agreement with\r
the Hawking-Bekenstein formula for large black holes. Furthermore, since we\r
are able to calculate the number of states to sufficient accuracy, we also rig\u0002orously obtain the precise sub-leading quantum correction to the Hawking\u0002Bekenstein formula. The physical aspects of this result will be discussed\r
elsewhere [15].\r
As it was shown in [14] the proper counting of states is given by all\r
sequences (of arbitrary length) of mi ∈ Z/2, mi 6= 0 such that\r
X\r
i\r
p\r
|mi|(|mi| + 1) < a (2)\r
where\r
a =\r
A\r
8πγl2\r
P\r
(3)\r
and γ is a parameter introduced in [16]. Addditionally we have to impose\r
the condition\r
X\r
i\r
mi = 0. (4)\r
It is our task to calculate the number of sequences satisfying (2) and (4).\r
We start with the sequences without (4) imposed. If we denote by N(a)\r
the number of sequences satisfying (2) then we can split the counting into\r
the first number m1 and the rest and write the recurrence relation\r
N(a) = θ(a −\r
√\r
3/2) \u00102N(a −\r
√\r
3/2) + 2N(a −\r
√\r
2) + . . .\r
+2N(a −\r
p\r
|mi|(|mi| + 1) + . . . + 2 h√4a\r
2 + 1 − 1\r
i\u0011 (5)\r
where the symbol [. . .] denotes the integer part. The first term on the RHS\r
corresponds to sequences with at least two elements and m1 = ±1/2, the\r
second to sequences with at least two elements and m1 = ±1 and so on and\r
the last term to sequences consisting of just m1 and nothing else.\r
We now assume (we will later prove that it is indeed the case) that the\r
leading part of the solution of the recurrence relation (5) is for large a given\r
by\r
N(a) = Ce2πγM a(6)\r
where γM is a constant to be determined.\r
2

Plugging the form (6) into (5) we get\r
1 = X∞\r
k=1\r
2 e\r
−2πγM\r
√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
(7)\r
where we neglected terms vanishing in the limit a → ∞. The solution to this\r
equation can be found numerically and reads\r
γM = 0.23753295796592 . . . (8)\r
We see that the coefficient of growth γM is between the lower and upper\r
bounds given in [14] i.e. ln 2\r
π < γM <\r
ln 3\r
π\r
. It seems that γM defined by\r
(7) cannot be calculated analytically or given as a solution of any “simpler”\r
equation. In the present paper we will also use ˜γ where\r
γ˜M := 2πγ = 1.492463591462379 . . . (9)\r
Since the condition (4) (as we will later prove) gives only power-like cor\u0002rections to N(a) therefore for large a we have from (6)\r
S = lnN(a) = γM\r
4γ\r
A\r
l\r
2\r
P\r
+ O(lnA). (10)\r
The comparison with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula (1) gives therefore\r
the unambiguous result\r
γ = γM (11)\r
so this physical requirement uniquely fixes the value of γ and hence the\r
’quantum of area’ in the theory.\r
One may note that the exponential ansatz (6) works in many other cases\r
for example if the number of states for a given spin j was (2j + 1) instead of\r
2 one would have in (7) (k + 1) instead of 2 in front of the exponential and\r
the appropriate γM would be equal to 0.273985635 . . ..\r
We now prove that the assumption (6) is actually correct and at the end\r
we add the condition (4) – the final result will not modify (11) and will enable\r
us to find the sub–leading (logarithmic) correction to the formula for entropy\r
(10).\r
We introduce the Laplace transform of N(a):\r
P(s) := Z ∞\r
0\r
da N(a) e\r
−sa\r
. (12)\r
3

The transform is well defined since we know that N(a) is piecewise continuous\r
and of exponential order i.e. it is bounded by Ke−βa for some K and β ([14]).\r
Integrating the relation (5) over a from 0 to ∞ we get an exact result\r
P(s) = 2\r
P∞\r
k=1 e\r

k(k+2)/4\r

P∞\r
k=1 e\r

√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
\u0011. (13)\r
If all the poles of the Laplace transform are distinct and of finite order then\r
we can make analytical continuation to the complex half-plane Re(s) > 0,\r
excluding positions of the poles, i.e. beyond the region allowed by the def\u0002inition (12). We now use the well known fact that the growth of N(a) is\r
determined by the poles of P(s) i.e.\r
N(a) = X\r
si, Re(si)>0\r
ressie\r
sia + O(an\r
) (14)\r
(we assumed here that all the poles are simple – otherwise we would have to\r
add some powers of a in front of the exponentials). Therefore our problem\r
boils down to determination of such complex si that satisfy\r
G(si) −\r
1\r
2\r
= 0 (15)\r
where we defined\r
G(s) := X∞\r
k=1\r
e\r
−s\r
√\r
k(k+1)/4\r
. (16)\r
It is important to analyze the distribution of zeroes of (G(s)−\r
1\r
2\r
) in more\r
detail. Since G(s) is complex analytic in the open domain Re(s) > 0 all the\r
zeroes are distinct, of finite order and there is no point of accumulation of\r
zeroes inside this domain. Therefore we have to analyze the domain’s border\r
i.e. the imaginary line Re(s) = 0. To analyze the limit when Re(s) ց 0\r
define a new function Gr(s) by subtracting two analytic (for Re(s) > 0)\r
functions\r
Gr(s) := G(s) −\r
X∞\r
k=1\r
e\r
−s(k+1)/2 −\r
s\r
4\r
X∞\r
k=1\r
e\r
−s(k+1)/2\r
k\r
(17)\r
The function Gr(s) is well defined in the whole domain Re(s) ≥ 0, continuous\r
and doesn’t have any singularities in this domain. On the other hand two\r
4

subtracted functions have a well defined limit when Re(s) ց 0 so we can\r
write\r
G(s) = Gr(s) + e\r
−s/2\r
e\r
s/2 − 1\r
−\r
se−s/2\r
4\r
ln 1 − e\r
−s/2\r
\u0001\r
. (18)\r
We see that apart from singularities at s = 4πin, the function G(s) has\r
a well defined limit when Re(s) ց 0 and in the domain Re(s) > 0 it is\r
complex analytic so in the whole domain Re(s) ≥ 0 there can be no points\r
of accumulation of zeroes – therefore all zeroes of the function G(s) −\r
1\r
2\r
in\r
the whole domain Re(s) ≥ 0 must be distinct and of finite order.\r
The only real zero is given by (9):\r
s = ˜γM. (19)\r
Close to this zero the function P(s) behaves as\r
P(s) ∼\r
CM\r
s − γ˜M\r
(20)\r
where\r
CM = −\r
1\r
2˜γMG′(˜γM)\r
= 0.509202564 . . . (21)\r
Therefore the leading behaviour for large a is given by\r
N(a) = CMe\r
γ˜M a\r
(22)\r
as was to be shown.\r
The complex zeroes of the function G(s)−\r
1\r
2\r
for Re(s) > 1. and |Im(s)| <\r
100 are listed below:\r
Re(s) Im(s)\r
1.49246359... 0\r
1.22393017... ± 22.1530069...\r
1.41016352... ± 35.9362749...\r

It is easy to prove that all the complex zeroes (i.e. poles of P(s)) with nonva\u0002nishing imaginary part must have smaller real part than ˜γM so in comparison\r
to the leading behaviour (22) they give exponentially small (and rapidly os\u0002cillating) contribution to N(a).\r
To illustrate the method in the cases where the number of sequences is\r
explicitly known let us give two examples. For sequences of half-integers\r
with the condition P|mi| < a the number of sequences is 3[2a] − 1 and by\r
the method described above we get\r
P(s) = 2\r
s (e\r
s/2 − 3) (23)\r
and indeed the real pole is equal to 2 ln 3. For sequences of half-integers with\r
the condition P(|mi|+1/2) < a the number of sequences is 1\r
3\r
(2[2a]+1 ±1)−1\r
(where + is for even and − for odd [2a]) and\r
P(s) = 2\r
s (e\r
s − es/2 − 2) (24)\r
and indeed the positive real pole is equal to 2 ln2. The actual numbers\r
of sequences in both cases indeed show that the leading behaviour is given\r
precisely by the largest positive real pole of P(s).\r
It can be useful to discuss how different ways of defining the sequences\r
are reflected in the properties of P(s). We have essentially three different\r
“statistics”.\r
• Boltzmann statistics (used in this paper): all sequences satisfying the\r
condition are allowed and are treated as different. Therefore P(s) is\r
given by eq. (13):\r
P(s) = 2\r
P∞\r

√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
\u0011 (25)\r
which has the largest positive real pole equal to γM.\r
• the intermediate statistics (between Boltzmann and Bose): it requires\r
that |mi+1| ≥ |mi| but treats for example (+1\r
2\r
, −\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r
2\r
, . . .) as different\r
from (−\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r

, . . .) – then we have\r
P(s) = Y∞\r

which has the largest positive real pole given by k = 1: s =\r
2ln 2\r
√\r
3\r
.\r
• Bose statistics: it requires not only that |mi+1| ≥ |mi| but treats for\r
example (+1\r
2\r
, −\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r
2\r
, . . .) as the same as (−\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r
2\r
, . . .) i.e. the\r
allowed sequences have the form ( 1\r
2\r
, . . . , −\r
1\r
2\r
, . . . , +1, . . . , −1, . . .). Then\r
we have\r
P(s) = Y∞\r

\u0010\r
1 − e\r
−s\r
√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
\u00112\r
(27)\r
and this P(s) does not have a pole with Re(s) > 0 at all so N(a) must\r
have milder growth than e\r
c\r
′a\r
. However when s → 0 the function P(s)\r
behaves as P(s) ∼ e\r
2ζ(2)\r
s where ζ(s) is the Riemann’s zeta function.\r
Hence we have accumulation of zeroes at s = 0 and the inverse Laplace\r
transform gives the exponential growth with √\r
a:\r
N(a) ∼ a\r
c\r
e\r
√\r
8ζ(2)a\r
(28)\r
(this type of statistics and therefore similar formula gives for example\r
the degeneracy of states in string theory).\r
At the end we impose the condition (4) i.e. Pmi = 0. We introduce\r
N(a, p) as the number of sequences satisfying\r
X\r
i\r
p\r
|mi|(|mi + 1) < a (29)\r
and\r
X\r
i\r
mi = p (30)\r
where p ∈ Z/2 and a ≥\r
p\r
|p|(|p| + 1). We can write the recurrence relation\r
as\r
N(a, p) = θ(a −\r
√\r
3/2)θ(a −\r
p\r
|p|(|p| + 1)) ×\r
\u0010\r
N(a −\r
√\r
3/2, p − 1/2) + (N(a −\r
√\r
3/2, p + 1/2)+\r
+N(a −\r
√\r
2, p − 1) + N(a −\r
√\r
2, p + 1) + . . . + 1\u0011\r
. (31)\r
where the first term inside the brackets on the RHS corresponds to sequences\r
with at least two elements and m1 = +1\r
2\r
, the second to sequences with at\r
7

least two elements and m1 = −\r
1\r
2\r
and so on and the last term to sequences\r
consisting of just m1 (which must be equal to p).\r
Next we define P(s, ω) as the Fourier transform with respect to p and\r
Laplace transform with respect to a of N(a, p):\r
P(s, ω) := X\r
p∈Z/2\r
Z ∞\r
0\r
da N(a, p) e\r
iωp e−sa\r
. (32)\r
Then summing and integrating eq. (31) we get\r
P(s, ω) = 2\r

√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
cos(kω/2)!−1\r
(33)\r
where we neglected some contributions from the endpoints (p ∼ a) what will\r
be justified a posteriori. Therefore we have to find the zeroes of the function\r
inside the bracket on the RHS of (33). With ω = 0 we know that the only\r
real zero (i.e. the one that gives the leading behaviour) is equal to s = ˜γM.\r
Expanding around s = ˜γM we get\r
1 − 2\r

\u0011\r

(34)\r
Hence the pole of P(s, ω) is given by\r
s = ˜γM − βMω\r

where\r
βM = −\r

√\r
k(k+2)/4\r
8G′(˜γM)\r

Therefore the leading behaviour of N(a, p) is given by\r
N(a, p) = CM\r

√\r
4πβMa\r

e\r
−p\r
2/(4βM a)\r
. (37)\r
As we see the endpoints p ∼ a are exponentially small justifying (33). Also we\r
see a posteriori that the terms O(ω\r
4\r
) from (35) would give in (37) corrections\r
of relative size 1/a so for large a we can neglect them.\r

Note that the gaussian distribution with respect to p in (37) with the\r
mean square deviation of the order of √a can be expected by the analogy\r
with the random walk where the average distance is zero and the mean square\r
deviation is of the order of square root of the number of steps.\r
Imposing the condition p = 0 we get the final result\r
N(a, 0) = CM\r
√\r
4πβMa\r

Therefore the entropy is given by\r

ln(A/l2\r

so for large A/l2\r
P we confirm (10) as the leading behaviour and we can un\u0002ambiguously both get the physical value of γ equal to γM (given in (8))\r
and resolve the controversy (summarized in [17]) about the coefficient of the\r
logarithmic term fixing it to −\r

Black hole entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity\r

Institute of Theoretical Physics, Warsaw University\r

Abstract\r
We calculate the black hole entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity as a\r
function of the horizon area and provide the exact formula for the\r
leading and sub-leading terms. By comparison with the Bekenstein–\r
Hawking formula we uniquely fix the value of the ’quantum of area’\r
in the theory.\r
The Bekenstein–Hawking formula gives the leading term in the entropy\r
of the black hole in the form\r
S =\r

P\r
(1)\r
where lP is the Planck length and A is the black hole horizon area. According\r
to the common belief, the entropy is always connected with the logarithm of\r
the number of microscopic states realizing a given macroscopic state. The\r
fact that the entropy in (1) is proportional to the area (and not as is usual to\r
the volume) has led to the formulation of the so called holographic principle.\r
It was however difficult to find the microscopic states that could account for\r
such an entropy.\r
The problem was attacked in two different approaches – in string theory\r
[1]-[5] and in Loop Quantum Gravity [6]-[10] (see also the review [11]). The\r
latter approach is based on a quantum theory of geometry. The basic ge\u0002ometric operators were introduced in [12, 13] and a detailed description of\r
the quantum horizon geometry was introduced using the U(1) Chern-Simons\r
theory in [10] where one can find the detailed discussion of the states on the\r
horizon of the black hole (see also [14]). However, the procedure introduced\r
in [10] for state counting contained a spurious constraint on admissible se\u0002quences and the number of the relevant horizon states is underestimated.\r
The correct method of counting was proposed in [14] but that analysis pro\u0002vides only lower and upper bounds on the number of states. The purpose\r
of this paper is to rectify this situation. We will provide the correct value\r
1

of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter that is needed to obtain agreement with\r
the Hawking-Bekenstein formula for large black holes. Furthermore, since we\r
are able to calculate the number of states to sufficient accuracy, we also rig\u0002orously obtain the precise sub-leading quantum correction to the Hawking\u0002Bekenstein formula. The physical aspects of this result will be discussed\r
elsewhere [15].\r
As it was shown in [14] the proper counting of states is given by all\r
sequences (of arbitrary length) of mi ∈ Z/2, mi 6= 0 such that\r
X\r
i\r
p\r
|mi|(|mi| + 1) < a (2)\r

the condition\r
X\r

It is our task to calculate the number of sequences satisfying (2) and (4).\r
We start with the sequences without (4) imposed. If we denote by N(a)\r
the number of sequences satisfying (2) then we can split the counting into\r
the first number m1 and the rest and write the recurrence relation\r
N(a) = θ(a −\r

where the symbol [. . .] denotes the integer part. The first term on the RHS\r
corresponds to sequences with at least two elements and m1 = ±1/2, the\r
second to sequences with at least two elements and m1 = ±1 and so on and\r
the last term to sequences consisting of just m1 and nothing else.\r
We now assume (we will later prove that it is indeed the case) that the\r
leading part of the solution of the recurrence relation (5) is for large a given\r
by\r
N(a) = Ce2πγM a(6)\r
where γM is a constant to be determined."""

where we neglected terms vanishing in the limit a → ∞. The solution to this\r
equation can be found numerically and reads\r
γM = 0.23753295796592 . . . (8)\r
We see that the coefficient of growth γM is between the lower and upper\r
bounds given in [14] i.e. ln 2\r
π < γM <\r
ln 3\r
π\r
. It seems that γM defined by\r
(7) cannot be calculated analytically or given as a solution of any “simpler”\r
equation. In the present paper we will also use ˜γ where\r
γ˜M := 2πγ = 1.492463591462379 . . . (9)\r
Since the condition (4) (as we will later prove) gives only power-like cor\u0002rections to N(a) therefore for large a we have from (6)\r
S = lnN(a) = γM\r

The comparison with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula (1) gives therefore\r
the unambiguous result\r
γ = γM (11)\r
so this physical requirement uniquely fixes the value of γ and hence the\r
’quantum of area’ in the theory.\r
One may note that the exponential ansatz (6) works in many other cases\r
for example if the number of states for a given spin j was (2j + 1) instead of\r
2 one would have in (7) (k + 1) instead of 2 in front of the exponential and\r
the appropriate γM would be equal to 0.273985635 . . ..\r
We now prove that the assumption (6) is actually correct and at the end\r
we add the condition (4) – the final result will not modify (11) and will enable\r
us to find the sub–leading (logarithmic) correction to the formula for entropy\r
(10).\r
We introduce the Laplace transform of N(a):\r

If all the poles of the Laplace transform are distinct and of finite order then\r
we can make analytical continuation to the complex half-plane Re(s) > 0,\r
excluding positions of the poles, i.e. beyond the region allowed by the def\u0002inition (12). We now use the well known fact that the growth of N(a) is\r
determined by the poles of P(s) i.e.\r
N(a) = X\r

ressie\r
sia + O(an\r

(we assumed here that all the poles are simple – otherwise we would have to\r
add some powers of a in front of the exponentials). Therefore our problem\r
boils down to determination of such complex si that satisfy\r

detail. Since G(s) is complex analytic in the open domain Re(s) > 0 all the\r
zeroes are distinct, of finite order and there is no point of accumulation of\r
zeroes inside this domain. Therefore we have to analyze the domain’s border\r
i.e. the imaginary line Re(s) = 0. To analyze the limit when Re(s) ց 0\r
define a new function Gr(s) by subtracting two analytic (for Re(s) > 0)\r

The function Gr(s) is well defined in the whole domain Re(s) ≥ 0, continuous\r

We see that apart from singularities at s = 4πin, the function G(s) has\r
a well defined limit when Re(s) ց 0 and in the domain Re(s) > 0 it is\r

the whole domain Re(s) ≥ 0 must be distinct and of finite order.\r

It is easy to prove that all the complex zeroes (i.e. poles of P(s)) with nonva\u0002nishing imaginary part must have smaller real part than ˜γM so in comparison\r
to the leading behaviour (22) they give exponentially small (and rapidly os\u0002cillating) contribution to N(a).\r
To illustrate the method in the cases where the number of sequences is\r
explicitly known let us give two examples. For sequences of half-integers\r
with the condition P|mi| < a the number of sequences is 3[2a] − 1 and by\r
the method described above we get\r
P(s) = 2\r
s (e\r
s/2 − 3) (23)\r
and indeed the real pole is equal to 2 ln 3. For sequences of half-integers with\r
the condition P(|mi|+1/2) < a the number of sequences is 1\r
3\r
(2[2a]+1 ±1)−1\r
(where + is for even and − for odd [2a]) and\r
P(s) = 2\r
s (e\r
s − es/2 − 2) (24)\r
and indeed the positive real pole is equal to 2 ln2. The actual numbers\r
of sequences in both cases indeed show that the leading behaviour is given\r
precisely by the largest positive real pole of P(s).\r
It can be useful to discuss how different ways of defining the sequences\r
are reflected in the properties of P(s). We have essentially three different\r
“statistics”.\r
• Boltzmann statistics (used in this paper): all sequences satisfying the\r
condition are allowed and are treated as different. Therefore P(s) is\r
given by eq. (13):\r
P(s) = 2\r

which has the largest positive real pole equal to γM.\r
• the intermediate statistics (between Boltzmann and Bose): it requires\r
that |mi+1| ≥ |mi| but treats for example (+1\r

which has the largest positive real pole given by k = 1: s =\r
2ln 2\r
√\r
3\r
.\r
• Bose statistics: it requires not only that |mi+1| ≥ |mi| but treats for\r
example (+1\r
2\r
, −\r
1\r
2\r
, +\r
1\r

1\r
2\r

1\r
2\r

allowed sequences have the form ( 1\r
2\r

1\r
2\r
, . . . , +1, . . . , −1, . . .). Then\r
we have\r

√\r
k(k+2)/4\r

(27)\r
and this P(s) does not have a pole with Re(s) > 0 at all so N(a) must\r
have milder growth than e\r
c\r
′a\r
. However when s → 0 the function P(s)\r
behaves as P(s) ∼ e\r
2ζ(2)\r
s where ζ(s) is the Riemann’s zeta function.\r
Hence we have accumulation of zeroes at s = 0 and the inverse Laplace\r
transform gives the exponential growth with √\r
a:\r
N(a) ∼ a\r
c\r
e\r
√\r
8ζ(2)a\r
(28)\r
(this type of statistics and therefore similar formula gives for example\r
the degeneracy of states in string theory).\r
At the end we impose the condition (4) i.e. Pmi = 0. We introduce\r
N(a, p) as the number of sequences satisfying\r
X\r
i\r
p\r
|mi|(|mi + 1) < a (29)\r
and\r
X\r
i\r
mi = p (30)\r
where p ∈ Z/2 and a ≥\r
p\r
|p|(|p| + 1). We can write the recurrence relation\r
as\r
N(a, p) = θ(a −\r
√\r
3/2)θ(a −\r
p\r
|p|(|p| + 1)) ×\r

where the first term inside the brackets on the RHS corresponds to sequences\r
with at least two elements and m1 = +1\r
2\r
, the second to sequences with at\r
7

least two elements and m1 = −\r
1\r
2\r
and so on and the last term to sequences\r
consisting of just m1 (which must be equal to p).\r
Next we define P(s, ω) as the Fourier transform with respect to p and\r
Laplace transform with respect to a of N(a, p):\r
P(s, ω) := X\r
p∈Z/2\r
Z ∞\r
0\r
da N(a, p) e\r
iωp e−sa\r

(33)\r
where we neglected some contributions from the endpoints (p ∼ a) what will\r
be justified a posteriori. Therefore we have to find the zeroes of the function\r
inside the bracket on the RHS of (33). With ω = 0 we know that the only\r
real zero (i.e. the one that gives the leading behaviour) is equal to s = ˜γM.\r
Expanding around s = ˜γM we get\r

(34)\r
Hence the pole of P(s, ω) is given by\r
s = ˜γM − βMω\r

βM = −\r

2/(4βM a)\r
. (37)\r
As we see the endpoints p ∼ a are exponentially small justifying (33). Also we\r
see a posteriori that the terms O(ω\r
4\r
) from (35) would give in (37) corrections\r
of relative size 1/a so for large a we can neglect them."""
