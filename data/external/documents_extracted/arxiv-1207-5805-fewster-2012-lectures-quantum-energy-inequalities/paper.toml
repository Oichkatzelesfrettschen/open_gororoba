ABSTRACT\r
We report our multiwavelength study of the 2011 outburst evolution of the newly dis\u0002covered black hole candidate X-ray binary Swift J1357.2–0933. We analysed the Swift X-ray\r
telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT) data taken during the ∼7 months duration\r
of the outburst. It displayed a 2-10 keV X-ray peak luminosity of ∼ 1035(D/1.5 kpc)2erg s−1\r
which classifies the source as a very faint X-ray transient. We found that the X-ray spectrum at\r
the peak was consistent with the source being in the hard state, but it softened with decreasing\r
luminosity, a common behaviour of black holes returning to quiescence from the hard state.\r
The correlations between the simultaneous X-ray and ultraviolet/optical data suggest a sys\u0002tem with a black hole accreting from a viscous disc, and we do not detect X-ray reprocessing\r
on the disc surface. The UVOT filters provide the opportunity to study these correlations up\r
to ultraviolet wavelengths, a regime so far unexplored. If the black hole nature is confirmed,\r
Swift J1357.2–0933 would be one of the very few established black hole very-faint X-ray\r
transients.\r

1 INTRODUCTION\r
X-ray binaries are the brightest X-ray point sources in our Galaxy.\r
They are black holes (BH) or neutron stars (NS) accreting material\r
from a companion star. The transient X-ray binaries alternate long\r
epochs of quiescence during which they have X-ray luminosities\r
of LX ∼ 1030−33 erg s−1 with outburst episodes during which\r
the luminosity increases more than two orders of magnitude. The\r
systems that reach a peak X-ray luminosity in their outbursts of\r
only L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1034−36 erg s−1\r
are called very-faint X-ray binary\r
transients (VFXTs). They are several orders of magnitude fainter at\r
their peaks than the better studied faint (L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1036−37 erg s−1\r
)\r
and bright (L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1037−39 erg s−1\r
) systems (Wijnands et al.\r
2006).\r
It is in the last decade that VFXTs have been investigated in\r
detail thanks to the improvement in sensitivity and resolution\r
of the X-ray instruments in orbit. However, even though the\r
number of known sources has increased, their characteristics\r
are still not well known. A considerable fraction of them have\r
exhibited thermonuclear Type-I X-ray bursts, identifying the\r
accretor as a NS (eg. Cornelisse et al. 2002; Del Santo et al. 2007;\r
Chelovekov & Grebenev 2007; Degenaar & Wijnands 2009).\r

Swift J1357.2–0933 is a new VFXT BH candidate\r
(Casares et al. 2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private\r
communication) discovered with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope\r
(BAT; Barthelmy et al. 2005) on 2011 January 28 (Krimm et al.\r
2011). In the following days it was observed with several X\u0002ray satellites as well as ground-based telescopes. The MPI/ESO\r
2.2m telescope at La Silla detected a new optical source within\r
the Swift/BAT error circle. The magnitude difference compared to\r
archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images (when the source\r
was in quiescence) was ∼6 mag. This indicates a Galactic origin,\r
likely a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) or a dwarf nova outburst\r
(Rau et al. 2011), although the X-ray spectrum pointed to a LMXB\r
nature (Krimm et al. 2011). The SDSS photometry indicated that\r
the quiescent counterpart was very red and that the companion\r
was likely an M4 star. This resulted in a distance estimate of ∼1.5\r
kpc (Rau et al. 2011). In this work we present analysis of the Swift\r
X-ray and ultraviolet–optical (UV/optical) data of Swift J1357.2–\r
0933 along its 2011 outburst.\r
2 OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSIS\r
Immediately following its discovery Swift J1357.2–0933 was mon\u0002itored with the Swift satellite (Gehrels et al. 2004) throughout its\r
outburst both with the X-ray telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2005)\r
and the Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005),

2 M. Armas Padilla et al.\r
which lasted ∼7 months. A total of 42 pointings were performed\r
during this period, for a total exposure time of 54.8 ks. A log of the\r
observations is given in Table 1. The observations were performed\r
daily in the first 10 days, and once every 2 days in the following\r
month. After that, the observations were separated by 1 to 2 weeks.\r
2.1 XRT data\r
The Swift/XRT observations were obtained both in photon\u0002counting (PC) and windowed timing (WT) modes. Due to the\r
high flux of Swift J1357.2–0933 the XRT was operated in WT\r
mode in the early observations in order to avoid pile-up (except for\r
the first observation; see below). When the count rate was below\r
0.5 count/s the observations were taken in PC mode (see Table 1).\r
The data were processed using the HEASoft v.6.11 software. The\r
raw data were reduced running the xrtpipeline task in which\r
standard event grades of 0–12 were selected for the PC data and\r
0–2 for the WT mode observations.\r
For every observation, spectra, lightcurves and images were\r
obtained using Xselect. The regions to extract the source events\r
both for PC and WT modes were centred at the source position\r
(RA=13h57m16.\r
s\r
86, Dec=-09◦32′38.\r
′′9, J2000, 0.′′42 error radius;\r
Krimm et al. 2011). For the WT data, we used a circle of ∼27 pix\u0002els of radius for the source and for the background extraction we\r
used an annulus centred on the source with ∼64 pixels for the inner\r
radius and ∼118 pixels for the outer radius. In the case of the PC\r
mode observations, the region used was a circle of ∼10 pixels of\r
radius for the source and for the background three circular regions\r
with the same size located in nearby source-free regions.\r
To look for eclipses, dips or X-ray bursts we checked the\r
lightcurves with different bin–sizes extracted for each observation.\r
We did not detect any evidence or feature that suggest modulations\r
or a pattern in the source flux, although we cannot rule out with\r
high confidence the presence of any modulations due to the low\r
count rate. We created the exposure maps in order to correct for\r
the effect of bad columns on the CCD, which in turn are used to\r
create the ancillary response files using the xrtmkarf task. The\r
latest versions of the response matrix files (v.14) were taken from\r
the HEASARC calibration database. Finally, with grppha we\r
grouped the spectra to have a minimum of 20 photons per bin to be\r
able to consistently use the χ\r
2\r
. Due to the low number of counts\r
collected during observations 38/39/40/411, we fitted these data\r
using both C-statistic and χ\r
2\r
but grouped them with a minimum of\r
5 photons per bin. The results using both methods were consistent\r
with each other.\r
The first observation 01 was taken in PC mode which is\r
severely affected by pile-up. It has a count rate of 2.3 c/s, while the\r
pile-up becomes considerable in PC mode for count rates above\r
∼0.6 c/s (Evans et al. 2009; see also the Swift/XRT analysis web2).\r
Therefore we do not include this observation in our analysis. In\r
the last two XRT observations (43/44) the source was not detected.\r
The count rates were calculated using the prescription for small\r
numbers of counts given by Gehrels (1986). We calculated the\r

observation-ID’s in the main text. The full observation–ID’s are in Table\r

95 per cent confidence upper limits on the flux with WebPIMMS\r
HEASARC tool3. An absorbed power-law model with a hydrogen\r
column density (NH) of 1.2×1020 cm−2(see Section 3) was\r
assumed. We used a photon index of Γ=2.13 which corresponds to\r
the value we obtained in the last observation where the source was\r
detected.\r
In order to improve the statistics we have also combined ob\u0002servations that were performed within a few days time span and\r
that yielded comparable fluxes. As such, we have combined obser\u0002vations 03–05, 07–12, 13–15, 17–20, 21–25, 26–20, 30–33, 34–37,\r
38–41 and 43–44. We extracted the combined spectra, lightcurves\r
and images in the same way as the individual cases. We merged\r
the individual exposure maps created for each image using the task\r
ximage.\r
2.2 UVOT data\r
The UVOT observations were performed in image mode. Most of\r
them were taken with 6 filters (v, b, u, uvw1, uvm2, uvw2) but\r
some of them with only a few filters and sometimes only one.\r
We calculated the source’s magnitude (in the Vega system) and\r
flux densities with the uvotsource tool, which performs aper\u0002ture photometry on the sky images. We selected a circular region\r
with a radius of 5 arcsec centred on the source and a circular re\u0002gion source–free with a radius of 18 arcsec for the background\r
correction. We corrected the magnitudes and fluxes for the Galac\u0002tic extinction. The reddening is E(B–V)=0.04 mag in the direction\r
of Swift J1357.2–0933 (Schlegel et al. 1998). Using this value and\r
the prescription of Pei (1992) we calculate the extinction for ev\u0002ery band. The obtained values are Av=0.123, Ab=0.163, Au=0.193,\r
Auvw1=0.263, Auvm2=0.387 and Auvw2=0.349. The source is lo\u0002cated at high Galactic latitude (b=50.0042) and for a distance of\r
1.5 kpc or larger, the source will be located outside the plane of\r
the Galaxy. Therefore, the measured column density (or redden\u0002ing) corresponds to the full Galactic one in that direction. In case\r
of no source detection the uvotsource tool returns a 3–sigma\r
upper limit for the magnitudes.\r
3 RESULTS\r
3.1 X-ray light curve and spectra\r
We fitted the spectra using XSPEC (v 12.7.0). All observations\r
were well fitted with a simple power–law (powerlaw) affected\r
by photoelectric absorption (phabs). We assumed a column\r
density to Swift J1357.2–0933 of 1.2 ×1020cm−2constant with\r
time. We inferred this value from the high-resolution X-ray spectra\r
obtained with XMM-Newton (Armas Padilla et al. 2012 in prep),\r
which is consistent with that reported by Krimm et al. (2011). The\r
results are reported in Table 1, where the flux errors have been\r
calculated following the procedure presented by Wijnands et al.\r
(2004). We also tried other single component models like a black\u0002body (bbodyrad) and an accretion disk consisting of multiple\r
blackbody components (diskbb, Makishima et al. 1986) but both\r
models could not fit the data accurately (χ\r
2\r
ν> 3 and χ\r
2\r
ν> 1.5,\r
respectively). A two component model (diskbb+powerlaw)\r
can fit the data as well, however it does not improve the best fit of\r
the single power–law model and the additional thermal component\r

calculated from the 0.5–10 keV unabsorbed flux by adopting a distance of 1.5 kpc.\r
contributes only a few per cent of the total flux.\r
In Fig. 1 we show the 0.5–10 keV light curve. The out\u0002burst has its maximum as observed during observation 02\r
in the beginning4\r
, where the peak of the unabsorbed flux is\r
4.1 × 10−10 erg cm−2s\r
−1\r
. This corresponds to a peak luminosity\r
of 1.1 × 1035 erg s−1assuming a distance of 1.5 kpc (Rau et al.\r
2011). After this, the luminosity monotonically decreases until\r
the source goes undetected using the XRT ∼180 days after the\r
discovery date. The upper–limits on the luminosity calculated from\r
4 Observation 01 could be brighter, but due to the strong pile-up it was not\r
included in the analysis.\r
the last two observations are between 2 and 6 × 1031 erg s−1.\r
Plotting the photon index evolution with time (Fig. 1) shows\r
that the photon index increases from a value of Γ ∼1.5 to a\r
value of Γ ∼2 indicating that the spectra became softer during\r
the decay of the outburst. This softening behaviour is also seen\r
when using the hardness ratio (HR; Fig.1 left panel). The hardness\r
ratio is defined as the ratio between the counts in the hard band\r
(2–10 keV) and the counts in the soft band (0.5–2 keV). We have\r
performed the same analysis when combining sets of observations\r
(see Section 2.1). The result is shown in Fig. 1 right panel. Due to\r
the smaller error bars, the increase of the photon index and the HR\r
decay are more clearly visible.

and the bottom panel is the hardness ratio evolution with time (ratio of the counts in the hard, 2-10 keV, and soft, 0.5-2 keV energy bands). All data are plotted\r
in the left figure, whereas in the right figure we present the result of the combined sets of observations (see Section 2.1).\r
3.2 Ultraviolet/optical and X-ray correlation\r
The Swift/UVOT observations were taken simultaneously with the\r
X-ray ones. Most of the observations were taken with all six filters,\r
which allows us to study the correlation between the X-ray and\r
the UV/optical emission along the outburst. Fig. 2 shows the X\u0002ray light curve and the UV/optical magnitudes in the Vega system.\r
The last UVOT detection (u band) was 203 days after the first de\u0002tection when the source was already undetected in X-ray. Over the\r
course of the outburst the brightness in all bands is decreasing si\u0002multaneously with the decline in the X-rays. This resulted in a clear\r
correlation between X-ray and UV/optical fluxes which is shown in\r
Fig. 3. We have assumed a power-law model to fit these correlations\r
and calculate the correlation slopes β (FUV/optical ∝ FX\r
β\r
). We\r
have calculated β for every UVOT band and for the X-ray flux in\r
the 2–10 keV energy range in order to compare them with values in\r
previous publications (e.g. Russell et al. 2006). However, the spec\u0002tral resolution of Swift/XRT allows us to also measure the correla\u0002tion slopes for X-ray fluxes in the 0.5–10 keV energy range. The\r
results are shown in Table 2. Clearly β increases towards shorter\r

We have analysed the XRT and UVOT data taken over the\r
∼7 months duration of the 2011 outburst of the newly discovered\r
candidate black hole LMXB Swift J1357.2–0933. We fitted the\r

Swift/XRT spectra using a simple power-law model affected by\r
absorption. The peak flux was reached at the beginning of the\r
outburst, after which, it steadily decreased until the source went un\u0002detected with XRT ∼180 days after its discovery. The unabsorbed\r
peak flux has a value of FX,unabs = 4.1× 10−10 erg cm−2s\r
−1\r
in\r
the 0.5–10 keV energy range, which corresponds to an outburst\r
peak luminosity of LX=1.1× 1035 erg s−1assuming a distance of\r
1.5 kpc. This low peak luminosity classifies Swift J1357.2–0933\r
as a VFXT, which have peak luminosities L\r
peak\r
X <1036 erg s−1\r
.\r
Even if the source was located at a distance of 8 kpc the inferred\r
peak luminosity is a few times 1036 erg s−1\r
, still in the faint\r
regime. However, such long distance is unlikely since the high\r
Galactic latitude (b=50.0042) would place Swift J1357.2–0933 at\r
6 kpc above the Galactic plane.

UV/optical light curves in the Vega system are plotted\r
Figure 3. Correlation between the UV/optical density fluxes and the X-ray\r
2–10 keV flux.\r
The system was in the hard state at peak of the outburst and\r
remained in this state throughout the outburst, which is usual at\r
these low X-ray luminosities (see Belloni 2010 for the state def\u0002initions). From the first observation until the last one the spectral\r
index of the power law increases from 1.5 to 2.1. As can be seen in\r
Fig. 1, the X-ray luminosity and photon index are anti-correlated.\r
The softening can also be seen in the HR curve demonstrating that\r
it does not depend on assumed spectral model. It shows how the\r
spectrum becomes softer as the luminosity decays (Fig. 1). Such\r
softening behaviour was also present in the VFXT XTE J1719–291\r
(Armas Padilla et al. 2011), but for this source the spectra were\r

flux in the 0.5–10 keV and 2–10 keV energy bands.\r
considerably softer, with a photon index regime from Γ=2.0 to\r
Γ=2.7. The reason for Swift J1357.2–0933 to have harder spectra\r
than XTE J1719–291 could be a difference in the nature of their\r
compact objects. Although it is not established, the characteristics\r
of XTE J1719–291 favour a NS accretor (Armas Padilla et al.\r
2011) whereas Swift J1357.2–0933 has been identify as a strong\r
BH candidate system using optical spectroscopy (Casares et al.\r
2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private communica\u0002tion).\r
The upper-limit on the luminosity inferred from the non\u0002detections in the last two observations is LX ∼ 2×1031 erg s−1\r
.\r
This could indicate that the nature of the accretor is a BH\r
since they typically have quiescent luminosities in the range of\r
LX ∼ 1030 − 1031 erg s−1 while the NS’s usually have quiescent\r
luminosities LX >1032 erg s−1(but see Jonker et al. 2007 for an\r
exception).\r
Several other BH sources have shown softening in their X-ray\r
spectra at low luminosities. XTE J1650–500 softened in its 2001-\r
2002 outburst. The photon index changed from Γ=1.66 to Γ=1.93\r
when the luminosity decayed to 2×1034 erg s−1(Tomsick et al.\r
2004). Also at these intermediate luminosities 4U 1543–47 evolved\r
from a photon index of Γ=1.64 in its hard state to a photon index\r
of Γ=2.22 at lower LX (Kalemci et al. 2005). By studying a sam\u0002ple of 7 BHs in their quiescence state, Corbel et al. (2006) arrived\r
to the conclusion that all BHs are softer in quiescence than in the\r
standard hard state. Using a study of 25 BHs, Dunn et al. (2010)\r
presented data from which the same conclusion can be inferred:\r
when data are available, the sources show softening towards quies\u0002cence. However, in the 2008 outburst decay of H 1743–322 to qui\u0002escence, Jonker et al. (2010) did not see any evidence of softening,\r
although it cannot be ruled out that this is caused the inaccuracy in\r
the photon index due to the high NH.\r
4.1 X-ray and UV/optical simultaneous data: A\r
non-irradiated accretion disc\r
The proximity and the low Galactic extinction towards\r
Swift J1357.2–0933 have made it possible to obtain X-ray\r
and UV/optical data simultaneously using XRT and UVOT\r
instruments on board Swift. Until today this had not been possible\r
for any VFXT since, in addition to their low luminosity, the vast

6 M. Armas Padilla et al.\r
majority are located towards the Galactic centre, which makes\r
it very difficult to detect the optical counterpart due to the high\r
Galactic absorption.\r
The optical/UV and X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated during\r
the outburst (Fig. 2). Russell et al. (2006) quantified the disc and\r
jet contribution from the optical/infrared and X-ray (2-10 keV)\r
correlation in the hard state. Based on the values of β expected\r
from the different emission processes (sections 3.3 and 3.4 of\r
their work), our correlation in the v band is consistent with a BH\r
accreting via a non irradiated viscous disc. For a viscously heated\r
disc, 0.15 6 β 6 0.25 is expected in the case of a BH (for V-band\r
optical and 2–10 keV X-ray), and for Swift J1357.2–0933 we find\r
β = 0.2 (Table 2). For a NS, 0.3 6 β 6 0.5 is predicted, so our\r
correlation is consistent with optical emission from a viscously\r
heated disc around a BH accretor. Higher values of β are expected\r
if the optical emission originates in an irradiated accretion disc or\r
a jet.\r
Additionally, Frank et al. (2002) predict a dependency of the slopes\r
β with the wavelength. For optical emission from a viscously\r
heated steady-state disc, β increases at shorter wavelengths. This\r
is consistent with our results, where β increases from 0.2 in the\r
v band to 0.35 in the uvw2 one (see Table 2). Therefore, all the\r
evidence favours UV/optical emission dominated by the viscously\r
heated disc, with little or no X-ray irradiation detected.\r

ABSTRACT\r
We report our multiwavelength study of the 2011 outburst evolution of the newly dis\u0002covered black hole candidate X-ray binary Swift J1357.2–0933. We analysed the Swift X-ray\r
telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical telescope (UVOT) data taken during the ∼7 months duration\r
of the outburst. It displayed a 2-10 keV X-ray peak luminosity of ∼ 1035(D/1.5 kpc)2erg s−1\r
which classifies the source as a very faint X-ray transient. We found that the X-ray spectrum at\r
the peak was consistent with the source being in the hard state, but it softened with decreasing\r
luminosity, a common behaviour of black holes returning to quiescence from the hard state.\r
The correlations between the simultaneous X-ray and ultraviolet/optical data suggest a sys\u0002tem with a black hole accreting from a viscous disc, and we do not detect X-ray reprocessing\r
on the disc surface. The UVOT filters provide the opportunity to study these correlations up\r
to ultraviolet wavelengths, a regime so far unexplored. If the black hole nature is confirmed,\r
Swift J1357.2–0933 would be one of the very few established black hole very-faint X-ray\r
transients.\r

X-ray binaries are the brightest X-ray point sources in our Galaxy.\r
They are black holes (BH) or neutron stars (NS) accreting material\r
from a companion star. The transient X-ray binaries alternate long\r
epochs of quiescence during which they have X-ray luminosities\r
of LX ∼ 1030−33 erg s−1 with outburst episodes during which\r
the luminosity increases more than two orders of magnitude. The\r
systems that reach a peak X-ray luminosity in their outbursts of\r
only L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1034−36 erg s−1\r
are called very-faint X-ray binary\r
transients (VFXTs). They are several orders of magnitude fainter at\r
their peaks than the better studied faint (L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1036−37 erg s−1\r
)\r
and bright (L\r
peak\r
X ∼ 1037−39 erg s−1\r
) systems (Wijnands et al.\r
2006).\r
It is in the last decade that VFXTs have been investigated in\r
detail thanks to the improvement in sensitivity and resolution\r
of the X-ray instruments in orbit. However, even though the\r
number of known sources has increased, their characteristics\r
are still not well known. A considerable fraction of them have\r
exhibited thermonuclear Type-I X-ray bursts, identifying the\r
accretor as a NS (eg. Cornelisse et al. 2002; Del Santo et al. 2007;\r
Chelovekov & Grebenev 2007; Degenaar & Wijnands 2009).\r

Swift J1357.2–0933 is a new VFXT BH candidate\r
(Casares et al. 2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private\r
communication) discovered with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope\r
(BAT; Barthelmy et al. 2005) on 2011 January 28 (Krimm et al.\r
2011). In the following days it was observed with several X\u0002ray satellites as well as ground-based telescopes. The MPI/ESO\r
2.2m telescope at La Silla detected a new optical source within\r
the Swift/BAT error circle. The magnitude difference compared to\r
archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images (when the source\r
was in quiescence) was ∼6 mag. This indicates a Galactic origin,\r
likely a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) or a dwarf nova outburst\r
(Rau et al. 2011), although the X-ray spectrum pointed to a LMXB\r
nature (Krimm et al. 2011). The SDSS photometry indicated that\r
the quiescent counterpart was very red and that the companion\r
was likely an M4 star. This resulted in a distance estimate of ∼1.5\r
kpc (Rau et al. 2011). In this work we present analysis of the Swift\r
X-ray and ultraviolet–optical (UV/optical) data of Swift J1357.2–\r

The Swift/XRT observations were obtained both in photon\u0002counting (PC) and windowed timing (WT) modes. Due to the\r
high flux of Swift J1357.2–0933 the XRT was operated in WT\r
mode in the early observations in order to avoid pile-up (except for\r
the first observation; see below). When the count rate was below\r
0.5 count/s the observations were taken in PC mode (see Table 1).\r
The data were processed using the HEASoft v.6.11 software. The\r
raw data were reduced running the xrtpipeline task in which\r
standard event grades of 0–12 were selected for the PC data and\r
0–2 for the WT mode observations.\r
For every observation, spectra, lightcurves and images were\r
obtained using Xselect. The regions to extract the source events\r
both for PC and WT modes were centred at the source position\r

used an annulus centred on the source with ∼64 pixels for the inner\r
radius and ∼118 pixels for the outer radius. In the case of the PC\r
mode observations, the region used was a circle of ∼10 pixels of\r
radius for the source and for the background three circular regions\r
with the same size located in nearby source-free regions.\r
To look for eclipses, dips or X-ray bursts we checked the\r
lightcurves with different bin–sizes extracted for each observation.\r
We did not detect any evidence or feature that suggest modulations\r
or a pattern in the source flux, although we cannot rule out with\r
high confidence the presence of any modulations due to the low\r
count rate. We created the exposure maps in order to correct for\r
the effect of bad columns on the CCD, which in turn are used to\r
create the ancillary response files using the xrtmkarf task. The\r
latest versions of the response matrix files (v.14) were taken from\r
the HEASARC calibration database. Finally, with grppha we\r

1.5 kpc or larger, the source will be located outside the plane of\r
the Galaxy. Therefore, the measured column density (or redden\u0002ing) corresponds to the full Galactic one in that direction. In case\r
of no source detection the uvotsource tool returns a 3–sigma\r

The Swift/UVOT observations were taken simultaneously with the\r

which allows us to study the correlation between the X-ray and\r
the UV/optical emission along the outburst. Fig. 2 shows the X\u0002ray light curve and the UV/optical magnitudes in the Vega system.\r
The last UVOT detection (u band) was 203 days after the first de\u0002tection when the source was already undetected in X-ray. Over the\r
course of the outburst the brightness in all bands is decreasing si\u0002multaneously with the decline in the X-rays. This resulted in a clear\r

peak flux has a value of FX,unabs = 4.1× 10−10 erg cm−2s\r

in\r
the 0.5–10 keV energy range, which corresponds to an outburst\r
peak luminosity of LX=1.1× 1035 erg s−1assuming a distance of\r

as a VFXT, which have peak luminosities L\r

X <1036 erg s−1\r
.\r
Even if the source was located at a distance of 8 kpc the inferred\r
peak luminosity is a few times 1036 erg s−1\r
, still in the faint\r
regime. However, such long distance is unlikely since the high\r
Galactic latitude (b=50.0042) would place Swift J1357.2–0933 at\r
6 kpc above the Galactic plane.

The system was in the hard state at peak of the outburst and\r
remained in this state throughout the outburst, which is usual at\r
these low X-ray luminosities (see Belloni 2010 for the state def\u0002initions). From the first observation until the last one the spectral\r
index of the power law increases from 1.5 to 2.1. As can be seen in\r
Fig. 1, the X-ray luminosity and photon index are anti-correlated.\r
The softening can also be seen in the HR curve demonstrating that\r
it does not depend on assumed spectral model. It shows how the\r
spectrum becomes softer as the luminosity decays (Fig. 1). Such\r
softening behaviour was also present in the VFXT XTE J1719–291\r
(Armas Padilla et al. 2011), but for this source the spectra were\r

flux in the 0.5–10 keV and 2–10 keV energy bands.\r
considerably softer, with a photon index regime from Γ=2.0 to\r
Γ=2.7. The reason for Swift J1357.2–0933 to have harder spectra\r
than XTE J1719–291 could be a difference in the nature of their\r
compact objects. Although it is not established, the characteristics\r
of XTE J1719–291 favour a NS accretor (Armas Padilla et al.\r
2011) whereas Swift J1357.2–0933 has been identify as a strong\r
BH candidate system using optical spectroscopy (Casares et al.\r
2011, Corral-Santana et al. 2012 submitted, private communica\u0002tion).\r
The upper-limit on the luminosity inferred from the non\u0002detections in the last two observations is LX ∼ 2×1031 erg s−1\r
.\r
This could indicate that the nature of the accretor is a BH\r
since they typically have quiescent luminosities in the range of\r
LX ∼ 1030 − 1031 erg s−1 while the NS’s usually have quiescent\r
luminosities LX >1032 erg s−1(but see Jonker et al. 2007 for an\r
exception).\r
Several other BH sources have shown softening in their X-ray\r
spectra at low luminosities. XTE J1650–500 softened in its 2001-\r
2002 outburst. The photon index changed from Γ=1.66 to Γ=1.93\r
when the luminosity decayed to 2×1034 erg s−1(Tomsick et al.\r
2004). Also at these intermediate luminosities 4U 1543–47 evolved\r
from a photon index of Γ=1.64 in its hard state to a photon index\r
of Γ=2.22 at lower LX (Kalemci et al. 2005). By studying a sam\u0002ple of 7 BHs in their quiescence state, Corbel et al. (2006) arrived\r
to the conclusion that all BHs are softer in quiescence than in the\r
standard hard state. Using a study of 25 BHs, Dunn et al. (2010)\r
presented data from which the same conclusion can be inferred:\r
when data are available, the sources show softening towards quies\u0002cence. However, in the 2008 outburst decay of H 1743–322 to qui\u0002escence, Jonker et al. (2010) did not see any evidence of softening,\r
although it cannot be ruled out that this is caused the inaccuracy in\r
the photon index due to the high NH."""

majority are located towards the Galactic centre, which makes\r
it very difficult to detect the optical counterpart due to the high\r
Galactic absorption.\r
The optical/UV and X-ray fluxes are strongly correlated during\r
the outburst (Fig. 2). Russell et al. (2006) quantified the disc and\r
jet contribution from the optical/infrared and X-ray (2-10 keV)\r
correlation in the hard state. Based on the values of β expected\r
from the different emission processes (sections 3.3 and 3.4 of\r
their work), our correlation in the v band is consistent with a BH\r
accreting via a non irradiated viscous disc. For a viscously heated\r
disc, 0.15 6 β 6 0.25 is expected in the case of a BH (for V-band\r
optical and 2–10 keV X-ray), and for Swift J1357.2–0933 we find\r
β = 0.2 (Table 2). For a NS, 0.3 6 β 6 0.5 is predicted, so our\r
correlation is consistent with optical emission from a viscously\r
heated disc around a BH accretor. Higher values of β are expected\r
if the optical emission originates in an irradiated accretion disc or\r
a jet.\r
Additionally, Frank et al. (2002) predict a dependency of the slopes\r
β with the wavelength. For optical emission from a viscously\r
heated steady-state disc, β increases at shorter wavelengths. This\r
is consistent with our results, where β increases from 0.2 in the\r
v band to 0.35 in the uvw2 one (see Table 2). Therefore, all the\r
evidence favours UV/optical emission dominated by the viscously\r
heated disc, with little or no X-ray irradiation detected.\r
