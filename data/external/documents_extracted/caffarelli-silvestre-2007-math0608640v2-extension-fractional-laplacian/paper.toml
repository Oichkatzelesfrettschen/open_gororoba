An extension problem related to the fractional Laplacian\r
Luis Caffarelli and Luis Silvestre\r
November 26, 2024\r
Abstract\r
The operator square root of the Laplacian (−△)\r
1/2\r
can be obtained from the harmonic\r
extension problem to the upper half space as the operator that maps the Dirichlet boundary\r
condition to the Neumann condition. In this paper we obtain similar characterizations for\r
general fractional powers of the Laplacian and other integro-differential operators. From those\r
characterizations we derive some properties of these integro-differential equations from purely\r
local arguments in the extension problems.\r
1 Introduction\r
Let us suppose we have a smooth bounded function f : R\r
n → R and we solve the extension\r
problem\r
u(x, 0) = f(x) for x ∈ R\r
n\r
(1.1)\r
△u(x, y) = 0 for x ∈ R\r
n\r
and y > 0 (1.2)\r
to obtain a smooth bounded function u. It is well known that −uy(x, 0) = (−△)\r
1/2f(x), and\r
therefore we can realize (−△)\r
1/2 as the operator T : f 7→ −uy(x, 0) in the above extension\r
problem.\r
This is easy to show by applying T twice. When we place −uy(x, 0) instead of f as the\r
Dirichlet condition in (1.1), we obtain −uy(x, y) instead of u as the solution of (1.1)-(1.2). Then\r
T (T (f))(x) = T (−uy(x, 0))(x) = uyy(x, 0) = −△xf(x). To show T = (−△)\r
1/2\r
it is only left to\r
check that T is indeed a positive operator, which follows by a simple integration by parts argument.\r
In this paper we will generalize this situation to a similar extension problem for each fractional\r
power of the Laplacian. We will construct any fractional Laplacian from an extension problem\r
to the upper half space for a specific elliptic partial differential equation. This allows us (in\r
forthcoming work) to treat non linear variational problems, involving fractional Laplacians, with\r
standard local perturbation methods from the calculus of variations. Examples of such methods\r
are the Almgren Frequency formula, and the Boundary Harnack inequality presented below. The\r
partial differential equation that we obtain will turn out to be degenerate for any power of the\r
Laplacian other than (−△)\r
1/2\r
, however they belong to a more general class of equations that\r
shares many of the essential properties of uniformly elliptic equations (as in [7], [6], [8] for the\r
divergence case, or [5] for the non-divergence case).\r
The fractional Laplacian of a function f : R\r
n → R is expressed by the formula\r
(−△)\r
s\r
f(x) = Cn,s Z\r
Rn\r
f(x) − f(ξ)\r
|x − ξ|\r
n+2s\r
dξ (1.3)\r
where the parameter s is a real number between 0 and 1, and Cn,s is some normalization constant.\r

It can also be defined as a pseudo-differential operator\r
(−△\\)\r
sf(ξ) = |ξ|\r
2s\r
fb(ξ)\r
The fractional Laplacian can be defined in a distributional sense for functions that are not\r
differentiable as long as ˆf is not too singular at the origin or, in terms of the x variable, as long as\r
Z\r
Rn\r
|f(x)|\r
(1 + |x|)\r
n+2s\r
dx < +∞\r
We will relate the fractional Laplacian with solutions of the following extension problem. For\r
a function f : R\r
n → R, we consider the extension u : Rn × [0, ∞) → R that satisfies the equation\r
u(x, 0) = f(x) (1.4)\r
△xu +\r
a\r
y\r
uy + uyy = 0 (1.5)\r
The equation (1.5) can also be written as\r
div (y\r
a∇u) = 0 (1.6)\r
Which is clearly the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional\r
J(u) = Z\r
y>0\r
|∇u|\r
2\r
y\r
adX (1.7)\r
We will show that\r
C(−△)\r
s\r
f = lim\r
y→0+\r
−y\r
auy =\r
1\r
1 − a\r
lim\r
y→0\r
u(x, y) − u(x, 0)\r
y\r
1−a\r
for s = 1−a\r
2\r
and some constant C depending on n and s. Which reduces to the regular normal\r
derivative in the case a = 0 (as in (1.1)-(1.2)).\r
If we make the change of variables z =\r
\u0010\r
y\r
1−a\r
\u00111−a\r
in (1.5), we obtain a nondivergence form\r
equation\r
△xu + z\r
αuzz = 0 (1.8)\r
for α =\r
−2a\r
1−a\r
. Moreover, y\r
auy = uz. Thus, we claim that the following equality holds up to a\r
multiplicative constant\r
(−△)\r
s\r
f(x) = − lim\r
y→0+\r
y\r
auy(x, y) = −uz(x, 0)\r
It seems convenient to keep this notation. The variable x is always in R\r
n\r
. The variables y\r
and z are nonnegative real numbers that satisfy the relation z =\r
\u0010\r
y\r
1−a\r
\u00111−a\r
. The function u is\r
the extension of f to the upper half space and takes values in R\r
n × [0, ∞). We will use u and its\r
version after the change of variables y 7→ z indistinctly, and we will call the variable either y or z\r
to point out the difference. Whenever we refer to a point in R\r
n+1 we will use capital letters (like\r
X).\r
2 Properties of the PDEs\r
In this section we will study the basic properties of the equations (1.5) and (1.8). We will develop\r
explicit Poisson formulas among other properties.\r

2.1 Harmonic functions in n + 1 + a dimensions\r
The equation (1.5) has a curious intuition behind it that will help us obtain several properties of\r
its solutions.\r
For a nonnegative integer a, suppose u(x, y) : R\r
n × R1+a → R is radially symmetric in the y\r
variable, meaning that if |y| = |y\r
′\r
| = r, then u(x, y) = u(x, y′). We can think of u as a function of\r
x and r, and in these variables write an expresion for its Laplacian:\r
△u = △xu +\r
a\r
r\r
ur + urr\r
We thus obtain an identical expression of equation (1.5) (with r instead of y, but that’s just\r
naming). As far as the expresion is concerned, there is no need to consider only integer values\r
of a. We can then think of the equation (1.5) as the harmonic extension problem of f in 1 + a\r
dimensions more. Although it is impossible to think of a meaning for R\r
n+1+a when a is not an\r
integer, the solutions of (1.5) will satisfy many properties common to harmonic functions.\r
2.2 Fundamental solution at the origin\r
To obtain the fundamental solution for (1.5) at the origin, we just have to consider the fundamental\r
solution of the Laplacian in n + 1 + a dimensions. If n − 1 + a > 1, it reads\r
Γ(X) = Cn+1+a\r
1\r
|X|\r
n−1+a\r
(2.1)\r
where the constant Cn+1+a is given by the formula Ck = π\r
k/2Γ(k/2 − 1)/4.\r
It can be verified as a direct computation that Γ is a solution of (1.5) when y 6= 0 and indeed\r
limy→0+ y\r
auy = −Cδ0 for some constant C as we will see later. Notice that Γ(x, 0) = C\r
|x|\r
n−1+a is\r
the fundamental solution of the fractional Laplacian (−△)\r
1−a\r
2 for some appropriate constant C\r
depending on n and a (Recall X = (x, y)).\r
Since the equation (1.8) can be derived from (1.5) by just a change of variables, we can also\r
change variables to obtain a corresponding fundamental solution\r
Γ( ˜ x, z) = Cn+1+a\r
1\r
\u0010\r
|x|\r
2 + (1 − a)\r
2 |z|\r
2/(1−a)\r
\u0011 n−1+a\r
2\r
(2.2)\r
that solves (1.8) when z 6= 0 and uz(x, z) → −δ0 as z → 0.\r
2.3 Conjugate equation\r
We have seen that if u is a solution of (1.5), then the function w(x, y) := y\r
auy(x, y) seems to carry\r
interesting information. Indeed, this function satisfies the conjugate equation\r
△xw −\r
a\r
y\r
wy + wyy = 0\r
that is nothing but (1.5) with −a instead of a. This property of w can be checked by a direct\r
computation:\r
△xw −\r
a\r
y\r
wy + wyy = y\r
a\r
\u0012\r
∂y△xu −\r

∂y\r
\u0012\r
△xu +\r
a\r
y\r
uy + uyy\u0013\r
= 0\r
3

The intuition behind the above fact is simple to explain when n = 1 (x ∈ R and y ∈ [0, +∞)).\r
The function w turns out to be the stream function related to ux in the following sense: if we set\r
v = ux, then clearly v is a solution of (1.5), since the equation is invariant under translations in\r
x. Thus we have div(y\r
a∇v) = 0. The vector field (yavy, −yavx) is then irrotational and there is\r
a function w such that ∇w = (−y\r
a\r
vy, yavx). This function w is the stream function of v, and it\r
satisfies the equation div(y\r
−a∇w) = 0. Now we check that w = yauy(x, y), since\r
∇(y\r
auy) = \u0012\r
y\r
auxy, ya\r
\u0012\r
a\r
y\r
uy + uyy\u0013\u0013 = (y\r
a\r

2.4 Poisson formula\r
We want to develop a Poisson formula P to explicitly solve (1.4)-(1.5).\r
u(X) = Z\r
Rn\r
P(x − ξ, y)f(ξ) dξ\r
The Poisson kernel P must be a solution to (1.5) where y > 0 and limy→0 P(x, y) = δ0. from\r
the previous sections, we see that the correct choice would be to take P(x, y) = −y\r
−a∂yΓ−a(x, y).\r
Therefore\r
P(x, y) = Cn,a\r
y\r
1−a\r
\u0010\r
|x|\r
2 + |y|2\r
\u0011 n+1−a\r
2\r
(2.3)\r
The fact that P is a solution to (1.5) where y > 0 is a consequence of the fact that Γ−a is\r
to the conjugate equation. Of course it can also be checked by a direct computation. Moreover,\r
P(x, y) = y\r
−nP(x/y, 1), so P must converge to a multiple of the Dirac delta as y → 0, so P is\r
indeed the Poisson kernel.\r
The corresponding Poisson kernel for the equation (1.8) can be obtained either by a change of\r
variables from (2.3) or by computing −P˜\r
z:\r
P˜(x, z) = Cn,a\r

3 Relation with fractional Laplacian\r
In this section we will see how the equations (1.5) or (1.8) relate to the operator (−△)\r
s\r
. Namely,\r
we will show that up to a constant factor\r
limy→0y\r
auy(x, y) = uz(x, 0) = −(−△)s\r
f(x) = Z\r

3.1 Proof using the Poisson formula\r
We can compute uz(x, 0) using the Poisson formula.\r
uz(x, 0) = limz→0\r

|x − ξ|\r
n+1−a\r
dξ (3.5)\r
= −C(−△)\r
1−a\r
2 f(x) (3.6)\r
where the limit in (3.4) exists and equals (3.5) as long as f is regular enough.\r
Changing variables, this implies that limy→0 −y\r
auy(x, y) also converges to a multiple of the\r
fractional Laplacian. The fact that y\r
auy(x, y) has a limit as y → 0, immediately implies that\r
limy→0\r
u(x,y)−u(x,0)\r
y1−a has the same limit.\r
Remark 3.1. The proof was done by computing uz. If instead we had chosen to compute y\r
auy\r
or\r
u(x,y)−u(x,0)\r
y1−a the complexity of the computation would be comparable.\r
3.2 Proof using Fourier transform\r
Alternatively, we can also prove (3.1) taking Fourier transform in x.\r
One way to do this is proving that the corresponding energy functionals coincide. Namely\r
Z\r
y>0\r
|∇u|\r

The equation (1.5) becomes\r
− |ξ|\r
2\r
uˆ(ξ, y) + a\r
y\r
uˆy(ξ, y) + ˆuyy(ξ, y) = 0\r
We thus obtain an ordinary differential equation for each value of ξ.\r
Suppose that φ : [0, ∞) → R is the minimizer of the functional\r
J(φ) := Z\r
y>0\r
(|φ\r
′\r
|\r
2 + |φ|\r
2\r
) y\r
ady\r
for φ(0) = 1, then φ solves the following equation:\r
−φˆ(y) + a\r
y\r
φˆ\r
y(y) + φyy(y) = 0\r
φ(0) = 1\r
limy→∞φ(y) = 0\r
5

By a simple scaling we can see that\r
uˆ(ξ, y) = ˆf(ξ)φ(|ξ| y)\r
and thus, the energy of u becomes\r

Thus we conclude (3.7). The corresponding Euler Lagrange equations for each energy must\r
then coincide up to a constant factor. Therefore we obtain\r
− limy→0\r
y\r
auy(x, y) = C(−△)\r
1−a\r
2 f(x)\r
where the constant C is given by J(φ).\r
We could also make another proof from (1.8). After taking Fourier transform, the equation\r
(1.8) becomes\r
− |ξ|\r
2\r
uˆ(ξ, z) + z\r
αuˆzz(ξ, z) = 0\r
We thus obtain an ordinary differential equation for each value of ξ.\r
Suppose that φ : [0, ∞) → R solves the following equation\r
−z\r
αφ′′(z) + φ(z) = 0\r
φ(0) = 1\r
limz→∞φ(z) = 0\r
(3.8)\r
Then by a simple scaling we can see that\r
uˆ(ξ, z) = ˆu(ξ, 0)φ(|ξ|\r
2\r
2−α z)\r
And then,\r
uˆz(ξ, 0) = ˆu(ξ, 0)|ξ|\r
2\r
2−α φ\r
′\r
(0)\r
= Ca |ξ|\r
1−a\r
uˆ(ξ, 0) = Ca |ξ|\r
1−a ˆf(ξ)\r
To prove (3.1) we now only need to show that such function φ exists and it is differentiable at\r
zero. We notice that for ε small enough then\r
φ(z) := min(1, z−ε)\r
is a supersolution, whereas for A and B large\r
φ(z) := e\r
−Az1/2+Bz2\r
6

is a supersolution. Thus, by Perron’s method, we can find a φ in between that solves (3.8).\r
Moreover this φ is Lipschitz at z = 0 and 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1 since it is trapped between φ and φ. From the\r
equation (3.8) we also see that then 0 ≤ φzz ≤ z\r
−α, thus φ ∈ C2−α. Not only does this complete\r
the proof of (3.1) but it also gives an interesting regularity estimate for the solution u with respect\r
to z. In the next section we will explore this issue further.\r
4 Reflection extensions\r
In order to apply interior Harnack estimates to our PDE (1.5) (or (1.8)), we must show that if the\r
operator (−△)\r
sf = 0 in an open ball, then we can reflect the solution u and make it a solution of\r
(1.5) (or (1.8)) across y = 0 (z = 0) in a suitable sense.\r
We first address the divergence case.\r
Lemma 4.1. Suppose that u : R\r
n × [0, ∞) → R is a solution to (1.5) such that for |x| ≤ r\r
lim\r
y→0\r
y\r
auy(x, y) = 0 (4.1)\r
then the extension to the whole space\r
u˜(x, y) = (\r
u(x, y) y ≥ 0\r
u(x, −y) y < 0\r
is a solution to\r
div(|y|\r
a∇u) = 0\r
in the week sense in the (n + 1) dimensional ball of radius R ({(x, y) : |x|\r
2 + |y|2 ≤ R2}).\r
Proof. Let h ∈ C∞\r
0\r
(BR) be a test function. We want to show that\r
Z\r
BR\r
∇u˜ · ∇h |y|\r
a\r
dX = 0 (4.2)\r
Let ε > 0, we separate a strip of width ε around y = 0 in the domain of the integral above\r

When we let ε → 0, the second term of the right hand side above clearly goes to zero because\r
|y|\r
a\r
|∇u|\r
2\r
is locally integrable, and the first term converges to zero if ε\r
au˜y(x, ε) → 0 as ε → 0.\r
Therefore, if ε\r
au˜y(x, ε) → 0 as ε → 0, then div(|y|a∇u) = 0 in the whole ball BR (accross\r
y = 0).\r
We must clarify in what sense we take the limit in (4.1). In this particular case, since the limit\r
vanishes, we could prove that actually u is C∞ in x and the limit holds in the uniform sense. In\r
general it would be convenient to have a weak definition of (4.1). The equation (4.2) becomes the\r
7

definition of (4.1) in the weak sense. In any case the limit (4.1) holds in the sense that, if we take\r
any smooth test function ϕ ∈ C∞\r

),\r
limy→0\r

auy(x, y)ϕ(x) dx = 0\r
For a general class of functions g, the problem\r
div(|y|\r
a ∇u) = 0 in the weak sense in BR\r
u = g on ∂BR\r
has a unique solution in the weighted Sobolev space H1,2(BR, |y|\r
a\r
). This kind of problems and\r
general properties of elliptic equations with A2 weights are studied in [7].\r
We now address the nondivergence case.\r
Lemma 4.2. Given a continuous function g on ∂BR, such that g(x, z) = g(x, −z), there exists a\r
unique function u ∈ C(BR) such that:\r
i. u solves uxx + |z|\r
α\r
uzz = 0 in BR ∪ {z 6= 0} in the classical sense.\r
ii. u ∈ C\r
1\r
(BR)\r
iii. uz(x, 0) = 0\r
Moreover, for this solution the Harnack inequality result of [5] applies.\r
Proof. We point out that any viscosity solution of (1.8) is C\r
2 away from z = 0, so it would be a\r
solution in the classical sense in BR ∪ {z 6= 0}.\r
Let us prove uniqueness first. Let us suppose there were two solutions u and v satisfying i., ii.,\r
and iii.. For an arbitrary ε > 0, consider w = u − v + ε |z|. Then w ≤ εR on ∂BR. Let us suppose\r
that w has an interior maximum at a point x ∈ BR. This point cannot be in BR ∩ {z 6= 0}, since\r
there w solves the non-degenerate elliptic equation (1.8) and thus it does not have an interior\r
maximum. Therefore, if there is any interior maximum, it has to be on {z = 0} ∩ BR. But clearly\r
there cannot be a maximum since ∂\r
+\r
z w > ∂−z w. Therefore w < εR in the whole ball BR. Since\r
ε is arbitrary, we conclude that u ≤ v in BR. Similarly we can obtain that v ≤ u in BR, so they\r
must coincide. Notice that we only used (i.) and (ii.) for uniqueness.\r
Now, let us prove existence. The subtle point here is to show that there is a C\r
1\r
solution. What\r
we do is to prove a uniform C\r
1,α estimate for solutions to the problem\r
u\r
ε = g on ∂BR (4.3)\r
△xu\r
ε + (|z| + ε)αuε\r
zz = 0 in ∂BR (4.4)\r
For any ε > 0, by the Schauder theory, this problem has classical solutions. If we have a C\r
1,η\r
estimate uniform in ε, we take limit as ε → 0 and obtain the desired solution.\r
The solutions u\r
ε are uniformly bounded in L∞ due to the maximum principle for uniformilly\r
elliptic equations. The equation (4.4) has constant coefficients with respect to x. This means that\r
we can differentiate the equation in a standard way to obtain uniform estimates for derivatives of\r
any order with respect to x (In terms of fractional Laplacian, this corresponds to the fact that\r
functions such that (−△)\r
su = 0 are C∞). Therefore we have that △xuε\r
is bounded independently\r
of ε in any smaller ball B(1−δ/2)R.\r
Since u\r
ε ∈ C2\r
(BR) and u is symmetric respect to the hyperplane z = 0, then u\r
ε\r
z\r
(x, 0) = 0.\r

From the equation (4.4):\r

Recall that α = −2a\r

and since a ∈ (−1, 1), then α < 1. We can then integrate u\r

This shows u\r

is C\r

in B(1−δ)R for η = min(1, 1 − α), independently of ε for any δ.\r
So, we can take ε → 0 and extract a subsequence that converges to the desired solution u.\r
Moreover, for any ε, u\r
ε\r
is smooth and satisfies the equation (4.4) that has smooth coefficients\r
and for which the Harnack inequality from [5] applies. Therefore, the same estimate passes to the\r
limit as ε → 0 and the solution u of the original problem satisfies Harnack inequality.\r
Remark 4.3. We have to be careful if we want to study the viscosity solutions to (1.8). The naive\r
definition using C\r
2\r
test functions would not suffice for uniqueness. If, for example, α > 0 and we\r
consider the function u(x, z) = |z|, then for any C\r
2\r
function φ touching u from below at a point\r
(x, 0), △xφ(x, 0) + 0αφzz(x, 0) = △xφ ≤ 0 and thus u(x, z) = |z| would be a (non-differentiable)\r
viscosity solution. However if we test against less regular functions, like φ(x, z) = z\r
2−α, then u\r
would fail to be a supersolution. In the notation of [4], this corresponds to the distinction between\r
C-viscosity solutions and L\r
p\r
-viscosity solutions.\r
5 Harnack and boundary Harnack type estimates\r
As an application on how to apply the equations (1.5) or (1.8) to the study of fractional harmonic\r
functions, we prove a Harnack inequality and a boundary Harnack inequality using (local) pde\r
methods.\r
Harnack inequality is not a new result for the fractional Laplacian. It can actually be proved\r
using direct classical potential methods like in [9]. A boundary Harnack estimate for the fractional\r
Laplacian was first proved in [3] using potential methods.\r
In this paper we derive the Harnack and boundary Harnack inequality for the fractional Lapla\u0002cian from the Harnack inequality for singular elliptic equations, either with A2 weights (see [7],\r
[8] and also [10]) or for certain classes of nondivergence problems (see [5]).\r
Theorem 5.1 (Harnack inequality). Let f : R\r
n → R be nonnegative such that (−△)sf = 0 in\r
Br. Then there is a constant C (depending only on s and dimension) such that\r
sup\r
Br/2\r
f ≤ C inf\r
Br/2\r
f\r

Proof using (1.5). We consider the extension u of f that solves (1.5). This function u is going to\r
be nonnegative since f is. We reflect it through the {y = 0} hyperplane. Since (−△)\r
sf = 0 in\r
Br, by Lemma 4.1, u is a solution to\r
div (|y|\r
a∇u) = 0\r
in the n + 1 dimensional ball of radius r centered at the origin.\r
We can then apply the result of [7] to obtain Harnack inequality for u and thus also for f in\r
half of the ball.\r
Proof using (1.8). We consider the extension u of f that solves (1.8). This function u is going to\r
be nonnegative since f is. We reflect it through the {z = 0} hyperplane. Since (−△)\r
sf = 0 in\r
Br, then u satisfies the conditions of Lemma 4.2. We can then apply the result of [5] to obtain\r
Harnack inequality for u and thus also for f in half of the ball.\r
Remark 5.2. In the two proofs above we can observe that what is needed for Harnack inequality\r
is that the function u is nonnegative in an n + 1 dimensional ball. The condition f ≥ 0 is indeed\r
sufficient for that, but it is not strictly necessary.\r
Theorem 5.3 (Boundary Harnack). Let f, g : R\r
n → R be two nonnegative functions such that\r
(−△)\r
sf = (−△)s\r
g = 0 in a domain Ω. Suppose that x0 ∈ ∂Ω, f(x) = g(x) = 0 for any x ∈ B1 \\Ω,\r
and ∂Ω ∩ B1 is a Lipschitz graph in the direction of x1 with Lipschitz constant less than 1. Then\r
there is a constant C depending only on dimension such that\r
sup\r
x∈Ω∩B 1\r
2\r
f(x)\r
g(x)\r
≤ C inf\r
x∈Ω∩B 1\r
2\r
f(x)\r
g(x)\r
(5.1)\r
for any x, y ∈ Ω ∩ B1/2(x0).\r
Proof. We consider the extension u\r
(1) of f and u(2) of g that solve (1.5). As before, we reflect u(k)\r
through {y = 0} for k = 1, 2 and obtain a solution across this hyperplane through Ω. What we\r
want to do is to find a map that straightens up the domain in order to apply the result of [8].\r
First, since Ω is a Lipschitz domain, we can find a bilipschitz map ϕ1 : R\r
n → Rn such that\r
ϕ1(x0) = 0 and ϕ1(Ω) ∩ B1/2 = B1/2 ∩ {x1 > 0}. We can extend this map to R\r
n+1 as constant in\r
the variable y. Now, the functions u\r
(k)\r
2 = u\r
(k) ◦ ϕ\r
−1\r
1\r
are solutions of the equation\r
div(|y|\r
a\r
bij∂ju\r
(k)\r
2\r
) = 0 in {y 6= 0} and across {y = 0} on ϕ1(Ω)\r
where the matrix bij is given by Dϕt\r
1Dϕ1\r
det Dϕ1\r
. Since ϕ1 is bilipschitz, then the singular values of Dϕ1\r
are bounded below and above and bij is uniformilly elliptic.\r
Now we take the map ϕ2 that maps R\r
n+1 \\{x1 ≤ 0∧y = 0} into the half space Rn+1∩{x1 > 0}.\r
This map is constant in the variables x1, . . . , xn, and if we write the pair (x1, y) in polar coordinates\r
(r, θ), it maps it to (r, θ/2). The singular values of Dϕ2 are all equal to 1 but the one in the direction\r
of ∂\r
∂θ ( i.e. the one in the direction (−y, 0, . . . , 0, x1)), that is 1/2. Thus the singular values of\r
Dϕ2 are bounded above and below. The functions u\r
(k)\r
3 = u\r
(k)\r
2\r
◦ ϕ\r
−1\r
2\r
satisfy the equation\r
div(cij∂ju\r
(k)\r
3\r
) = 0 in B1/2 ∩ {x1 > 0}\r
The matrix cij is given by (cij ) = Dϕt\r
2\r
(bij ) Dϕ2 m(X), where the weighted measure m(X) dX is\r
the pull back of the measure |y|\r
a dX by ϕ\r
−1\r
2\r
. Since the A2 class of weights is invariant by (local)\r
bilipschitz transformations, the equation still fits into the theory in [8].\r

(5.2)\r
for some universal r < 1. By a standard covering argument, (5.2) together with Theorem 5.1\r
imply (5.1).\r
As before, the condition in Theorem 5.3 that requires f and g to be nonnegative in the whole\r
R\r
n is not sharp. In the proof we can see that what we need to apply the result of [8] is that\r
the corresponding extensions u\r
(1) and u(2) are nonnegative in the unit ball of n + 1 dimensions.\r
The advantage is that this is a local condition, therefore we can obtain the standard corollary of\r
boundary Harnack saying that u\r
(1)\r
u(2) is C\r
α in a neighborhood of the origin. In particular f\r
g\r
is C\r
α,\r
which is not strictly a corollary of Theorem 5.3 but of its proof.\r
Corollary 5.4. Let f and g be as in Theorem 5.3, then f(x)\r
g(x)\r
is a C\r
α function in B1/2 ∩ Ω for\r
some universal α\r
Remark 5.5. In [8], the boundary Harnack principle is proven for A2 weights and Lipschitz\r
domains. An extension of that result to nontangentiably accesible (NTA) domains (as in the last\r
section of [2]) would lead to a boudary Harnack principle for the fractional Laplacian to domains\r
only requiring a uniform capacity condition.\r
6 Monotonicity Formulas\r
Monotonicity formulas are a very powerfull tool in the study of the regularity properties of elliptic\r
PDEs. They have been used in a number of problems to exploit the local properties of the equations\r
by giving information about the blowup configurations. Since the equation (1.5) represents a\r
harmonic function in n + 1 + a dimensions, it is to be expected that any monotonicity formula\r
known for harmonic functions will have its counterpart for solutions to (1.5). For example, the\r
simplest one would be that if\r
△xu +\r
a\r
y\r
uy + uyy = 0 for (x, y) ∈ B\r
+\r
1\r
limy→0y\r
auy(x, y) = 0for |x| ≤ 1\r

where B\r
+\r
R stands for the n + 1 dimensional half ball {(x, y) : |x|\r
2 + y\r
2 < 1 ∧ y > 0}.\r
The weight y\r
a\r
is the correct one if we think that the function u is radially symmetric in a + 1\r
variables and the y is the modulus of those variables as it is explained in section 2.1\r
More interestingly, we have Almgren’s frequency formula\r

Theorem 6.1. If u is a solution to (1.5) in B\r
+\r
R0\r
such that for any x in B\r
+\r
R0\r
, either u(x, 0) = 0\r
or limy→0 y\r
auy(x, y) = 0, then\r

is monotone nondecreasing in R for R < R0\r
Moreover, Φ is constant if and only if u is homogeneous.\r
The proof is essentially the same as for harmonic functions and it is mainly computational.\r
The original proof can be found in [1]. Here we only need a few minor modifications for our case.\r
First we need the following lemma.\r
Lemma 6.2. Let u be s solution of (1.5) in BR0 ∩ {y 6= 0}, such that y\r
auy(x, y) is bounded and\r
for every x with |x| < R0 either u(x, 0) = 0 or limy→0 y\r
auy(x, y) = 0. Then the following identity\r
holds for any R ≤ R0.\r

2\r

where uτ stands for the gradient of u tangential to ∂Br.\r
Proof. The only thing we have to notice is that since u solves (1.5), then\r

The second term comes from the integration of the vector field at the bottom of the half sphere.\r
We observe it goes to zero as ε → 0 since there we have that for each x either u(x, 0) = 0 or\r
limy→0 y\r
auy(x, y) = 0 and a < 1. So we can remove that term and extend the expresion to the\r

Expanding |∇u|\r
2 = |uτ |2 + |uν|2 we obtain (6.1).\r
Proof of Theorem 6.1. We will show that log Φ(R) is nondecreasing. By the usual scaling argu\u0002ment, it is enough to check it at r = 1. We compute log Φ:\r
log Φ(R) = log R + log Z\r

and now we compute its derivative at R = 1. Let S1 = ∂B1 ∩ {y > 0}, then\r

and the equality is achieved if and only if uν = λu for some constant λ. Therefore, only when u\r

7 Other operators\r
The results in this paper suggest that many integro-differential operators can be thought in the\r
same way. Let us suppose we have smooth uniformilly elliptic coefficients aij in R\r
n × [0, ∞).\r
13

Consider the following extension problem:\r
u(x, 0) = f(x) for x ∈ R\r
n\r
(7.1)\r
Xaijuij (x, y) = 0 for x ∈ R\r
n\r
and y > 0 (7.2)\r
If we now consider the operator f 7→ uy(x, 0), this is going to be some integro-differential operator\r
of degree one that we can also obtain from a local type pde. We can push the situation even\r
further by considering coefficients aij that are only measurable, and maybe singular near y = 0.\r
It is not reasonable to expect that every integro-differential operator can be realized in this way.\r
It looks difficult to characterize the ones that can. But certainly for many it is possible.\r
Let us consider the case when the operators are invariant under translation in x. We want to\r
study the operator that maps the Dirichlet to the Neumann condition for the equation\r
△xu + a(z)uzz = 0\r
we take the Fourier transform in x and proceed as in section 3.2 to obtain the differential equation\r
−a(z)φ\r
′′(z) + |ξ|\r
2\r
φ(z) = 0\r
φ(0) = 1\r
limz→∞φ(z) = 0\r
(7.3)\r
The operator T : u(x, 0) 7→ −uz(x, 0) is then the pseudodifferential operator whose symbol s(ξ) is\r
given by solving (7.3) and computing φz(0) for each value of ξ.\r
The question is what symbols s(ξ) can we obtain by the above procedure. We can see that\r
s(ξ) is radially symmetric and monotone increasing in |ξ|. Indeed, if φ1 is a solution of (7.3) for\r
|ξ| = r0 and ϕ1 for |ξ1| = r1 ≥ r0 then\r
−a(z)φ\r
′′\r
1\r
(z) + |ξ0|\r
2\r
φ1(z) = (|ξ0|\r
2 − |ξ1|2\r
)φ1(z) < 0\r
Thus φ1 < φ0 by comparison principle.\r
As ξ → 0, the solution φ of (7.3) converges to φ ≡ 1, so s(0) = 0. We leave the question if\r
every radially symmetric symbol s such that s(0) = 0 and it is monotone increasing with respect\r
to |ξ| can be obtained by a suitable choice of a(z).\r

An extension problem related to the fractional Laplacian\r
Luis Caffarelli and Luis Silvestre\r
November 26, 2024\r
Abstract\r
The operator square root of the Laplacian (−△)\r
1/2\r
can be obtained from the harmonic\r
extension problem to the upper half space as the operator that maps the Dirichlet boundary\r
condition to the Neumann condition. In this paper we obtain similar characterizations for\r
general fractional powers of the Laplacian and other integro-differential operators. From those\r
characterizations we derive some properties of these integro-differential equations from purely\r
local arguments in the extension problems."""

Let us suppose we have a smooth bounded function f : R\r
n → R and we solve the extension\r
problem\r
u(x, 0) = f(x) for x ∈ R\r
n\r
(1.1)\r
△u(x, y) = 0 for x ∈ R\r
n\r
and y > 0 (1.2)\r
to obtain a smooth bounded function u. It is well known that −uy(x, 0) = (−△)\r
1/2f(x), and\r
therefore we can realize (−△)\r
1/2 as the operator T : f 7→ −uy(x, 0) in the above extension\r
problem.\r
This is easy to show by applying T twice. When we place −uy(x, 0) instead of f as the\r
Dirichlet condition in (1.1), we obtain −uy(x, y) instead of u as the solution of (1.1)-(1.2). Then\r
T (T (f))(x) = T (−uy(x, 0))(x) = uyy(x, 0) = −△xf(x). To show T = (−△)\r
1/2\r
it is only left to\r
check that T is indeed a positive operator, which follows by a simple integration by parts argument.\r
In this paper we will generalize this situation to a similar extension problem for each fractional\r
power of the Laplacian. We will construct any fractional Laplacian from an extension problem\r
to the upper half space for a specific elliptic partial differential equation. This allows us (in\r
forthcoming work) to treat non linear variational problems, involving fractional Laplacians, with\r
standard local perturbation methods from the calculus of variations. Examples of such methods\r
are the Almgren Frequency formula, and the Boundary Harnack inequality presented below. The\r
partial differential equation that we obtain will turn out to be degenerate for any power of the\r
Laplacian other than (−△)\r
1/2\r
, however they belong to a more general class of equations that\r
shares many of the essential properties of uniformly elliptic equations (as in [7], [6], [8] for the\r
divergence case, or [5] for the non-divergence case).\r
The fractional Laplacian of a function f : R\r

The equation (1.5) has a curious intuition behind it that will help us obtain several properties of\r
its solutions.\r
For a nonnegative integer a, suppose u(x, y) : R\r
n × R1+a → R is radially symmetric in the y\r
variable, meaning that if |y| = |y\r
′\r
| = r, then u(x, y) = u(x, y′). We can think of u as a function of\r
x and r, and in these variables write an expresion for its Laplacian:\r
△u = △xu +\r
a\r
r\r
ur + urr\r
We thus obtain an identical expression of equation (1.5) (with r instead of y, but that’s just\r
naming). As far as the expresion is concerned, there is no need to consider only integer values\r
of a. We can then think of the equation (1.5) as the harmonic extension problem of f in 1 + a\r
dimensions more. Although it is impossible to think of a meaning for R\r
n+1+a when a is not an\r
integer, the solutions of (1.5) will satisfy many properties common to harmonic functions."""

The intuition behind the above fact is simple to explain when n = 1 (x ∈ R and y ∈ [0, +∞)).\r
The function w turns out to be the stream function related to ux in the following sense: if we set\r
v = ux, then clearly v is a solution of (1.5), since the equation is invariant under translations in\r
x. Thus we have div(y\r
a∇v) = 0. The vector field (yavy, −yavx) is then irrotational and there is\r
a function w such that ∇w = (−y\r
a\r

has a unique solution in the weighted Sobolev space H1,2(BR, |y|\r
a\r
). This kind of problems and\r
general properties of elliptic equations with A2 weights are studied in [7].\r
We now address the nondivergence case.\r
Lemma 4.2. Given a continuous function g on ∂BR, such that g(x, z) = g(x, −z), there exists a\r
unique function u ∈ C(BR) such that:\r
i. u solves uxx + |z|\r
α\r
uzz = 0 in BR ∪ {z 6= 0} in the classical sense.\r
ii. u ∈ C\r
1\r
(BR)\r
iii. uz(x, 0) = 0\r
Moreover, for this solution the Harnack inequality result of [5] applies.\r
Proof. We point out that any viscosity solution of (1.8) is C\r
2 away from z = 0, so it would be a\r
solution in the classical sense in BR ∪ {z 6= 0}.\r
Let us prove uniqueness first. Let us suppose there were two solutions u and v satisfying i., ii.,\r
and iii.. For an arbitrary ε > 0, consider w = u − v + ε |z|. Then w ≤ εR on ∂BR. Let us suppose\r
that w has an interior maximum at a point x ∈ BR. This point cannot be in BR ∩ {z 6= 0}, since\r
there w solves the non-degenerate elliptic equation (1.8) and thus it does not have an interior\r
maximum. Therefore, if there is any interior maximum, it has to be on {z = 0} ∩ BR. But clearly\r
there cannot be a maximum since ∂\r
+\r
z w > ∂−z w. Therefore w < εR in the whole ball BR. Since\r
ε is arbitrary, we conclude that u ≤ v in BR. Similarly we can obtain that v ≤ u in BR, so they\r
must coincide. Notice that we only used (i.) and (ii.) for uniqueness.\r
Now, let us prove existence. The subtle point here is to show that there is a C\r
1\r
solution. What\r
we do is to prove a uniform C\r
1,α estimate for solutions to the problem\r
u\r
ε = g on ∂BR (4.3)\r
△xu\r
ε + (|z| + ε)αuε\r
zz = 0 in ∂BR (4.4)\r
For any ε > 0, by the Schauder theory, this problem has classical solutions. If we have a C\r
1,η\r
estimate uniform in ε, we take limit as ε → 0 and obtain the desired solution.\r
The solutions u\r
ε are uniformly bounded in L∞ due to the maximum principle for uniformilly\r
elliptic equations. The equation (4.4) has constant coefficients with respect to x. This means that\r
we can differentiate the equation in a standard way to obtain uniform estimates for derivatives of\r
any order with respect to x (In terms of fractional Laplacian, this corresponds to the fact that\r
functions such that (−△)\r
su = 0 are C∞). Therefore we have that △xuε\r
is bounded independently\r
of ε in any smaller ball B(1−δ/2)R.\r
Since u\r
ε ∈ C2\r
(BR) and u is symmetric respect to the hyperplane z = 0, then u\r
ε\r

(x, 0) = 0."""

So, we can take ε → 0 and extract a subsequence that converges to the desired solution u.\r
Moreover, for any ε, u\r
ε\r
is smooth and satisfies the equation (4.4) that has smooth coefficients\r
and for which the Harnack inequality from [5] applies. Therefore, the same estimate passes to the\r
limit as ε → 0 and the solution u of the original problem satisfies Harnack inequality.\r
Remark 4.3. We have to be careful if we want to study the viscosity solutions to (1.8). The naive\r
definition using C\r
2\r
test functions would not suffice for uniqueness. If, for example, α > 0 and we\r
consider the function u(x, z) = |z|, then for any C\r

function φ touching u from below at a point\r
(x, 0), △xφ(x, 0) + 0αφzz(x, 0) = △xφ ≤ 0 and thus u(x, z) = |z| would be a (non-differentiable)\r
viscosity solution. However if we test against less regular functions, like φ(x, z) = z\r
2−α, then u\r
would fail to be a supersolution. In the notation of [4], this corresponds to the distinction between\r
C-viscosity solutions and L\r

As an application on how to apply the equations (1.5) or (1.8) to the study of fractional harmonic\r
functions, we prove a Harnack inequality and a boundary Harnack inequality using (local) pde\r
methods.\r
Harnack inequality is not a new result for the fractional Laplacian. It can actually be proved\r
using direct classical potential methods like in [9]. A boundary Harnack estimate for the fractional\r
Laplacian was first proved in [3] using potential methods.\r
In this paper we derive the Harnack and boundary Harnack inequality for the fractional Lapla\u0002cian from the Harnack inequality for singular elliptic equations, either with A2 weights (see [7],\r
[8] and also [10]) or for certain classes of nondivergence problems (see [5]).\r
Theorem 5.1 (Harnack inequality). Let f : R\r
n → R be nonnegative such that (−△)sf = 0 in\r
Br. Then there is a constant C (depending only on s and dimension) such that\r
sup\r
Br/2\r
f ≤ C inf\r

Proof using (1.5). We consider the extension u of f that solves (1.5). This function u is going to\r
be nonnegative since f is. We reflect it through the {y = 0} hyperplane. Since (−△)\r
sf = 0 in\r
Br, by Lemma 4.1, u is a solution to\r
div (|y|\r
a∇u) = 0\r
in the n + 1 dimensional ball of radius r centered at the origin.\r
We can then apply the result of [7] to obtain Harnack inequality for u and thus also for f in\r
half of the ball.\r
Proof using (1.8). We consider the extension u of f that solves (1.8). This function u is going to\r
be nonnegative since f is. We reflect it through the {z = 0} hyperplane. Since (−△)\r
sf = 0 in\r
Br, then u satisfies the conditions of Lemma 4.2. We can then apply the result of [5] to obtain\r
Harnack inequality for u and thus also for f in half of the ball.\r
Remark 5.2. In the two proofs above we can observe that what is needed for Harnack inequality\r
is that the function u is nonnegative in an n + 1 dimensional ball. The condition f ≥ 0 is indeed\r
sufficient for that, but it is not strictly necessary.\r
Theorem 5.3 (Boundary Harnack). Let f, g : R\r
n → R be two nonnegative functions such that\r
(−△)\r
sf = (−△)s\r
g = 0 in a domain Ω. Suppose that x0 ∈ ∂Ω, f(x) = g(x) = 0 for any x ∈ B1 \\Ω,\r
and ∂Ω ∩ B1 is a Lipschitz graph in the direction of x1 with Lipschitz constant less than 1. Then\r
there is a constant C depending only on dimension such that\r

x∈Ω∩B 1\r
2\r
f(x)\r
g(x)\r
(5.1)\r
for any x, y ∈ Ω ∩ B1/2(x0).\r
Proof. We consider the extension u\r
(1) of f and u(2) of g that solve (1.5). As before, we reflect u(k)\r
through {y = 0} for k = 1, 2 and obtain a solution across this hyperplane through Ω. What we\r
want to do is to find a map that straightens up the domain in order to apply the result of [8].\r
First, since Ω is a Lipschitz domain, we can find a bilipschitz map ϕ1 : R\r
n → Rn such that\r
ϕ1(x0) = 0 and ϕ1(Ω) ∩ B1/2 = B1/2 ∩ {x1 > 0}. We can extend this map to R\r
n+1 as constant in\r
the variable y. Now, the functions u\r
(k)\r
2 = u\r
(k) ◦ ϕ\r
−1\r
1\r
are solutions of the equation\r
div(|y|\r
a\r
bij∂ju\r
(k)\r
2\r
) = 0 in {y 6= 0} and across {y = 0} on ϕ1(Ω)\r
where the matrix bij is given by Dϕt\r
1Dϕ1\r
det Dϕ1\r
. Since ϕ1 is bilipschitz, then the singular values of Dϕ1\r
are bounded below and above and bij is uniformilly elliptic.\r
Now we take the map ϕ2 that maps R\r
n+1 \\{x1 ≤ 0∧y = 0} into the half space Rn+1∩{x1 > 0}.\r
This map is constant in the variables x1, . . . , xn, and if we write the pair (x1, y) in polar coordinates\r
(r, θ), it maps it to (r, θ/2). The singular values of Dϕ2 are all equal to 1 but the one in the direction\r
of ∂\r
∂θ ( i.e. the one in the direction (−y, 0, . . . , 0, x1)), that is 1/2. Thus the singular values of\r
Dϕ2 are bounded above and below. The functions u\r
(k)\r

−1\r
2\r
satisfy the equation\r
div(cij∂ju\r

As before, the condition in Theorem 5.3 that requires f and g to be nonnegative in the whole\r
R\r
n is not sharp. In the proof we can see that what we need to apply the result of [8] is that\r
the corresponding extensions u\r
(1) and u(2) are nonnegative in the unit ball of n + 1 dimensions.\r
The advantage is that this is a local condition, therefore we can obtain the standard corollary of\r
boundary Harnack saying that u\r
(1)\r
u(2) is C\r
α in a neighborhood of the origin. In particular f\r
g\r

Corollary 5.4. Let f and g be as in Theorem 5.3, then f(x)\r

Remark 5.5. In [8], the boundary Harnack principle is proven for A2 weights and Lipschitz\r
domains. An extension of that result to nontangentiably accesible (NTA) domains (as in the last\r
section of [2]) would lead to a boudary Harnack principle for the fractional Laplacian to domains\r

further by considering coefficients aij that are only measurable, and maybe singular near y = 0.\r
It is not reasonable to expect that every integro-differential operator can be realized in this way.\r
It looks difficult to characterize the ones that can. But certainly for many it is possible.\r
Let us consider the case when the operators are invariant under translation in x. We want to\r
study the operator that maps the Dirichlet to the Neumann condition for the equation\r
△xu + a(z)uzz = 0\r
we take the Fourier transform in x and proceed as in section 3.2 to obtain the differential equation\r

The operator T : u(x, 0) 7→ −uz(x, 0) is then the pseudodifferential operator whose symbol s(ξ) is\r
given by solving (7.3) and computing φz(0) for each value of ξ.\r
The question is what symbols s(ξ) can we obtain by the above procedure. We can see that\r
s(ξ) is radially symmetric and monotone increasing in |ξ|. Indeed, if φ1 is a solution of (7.3) for\r
|ξ| = r0 and ϕ1 for |ξ1| = r1 ≥ r0 then\r

2\r
φ1(z) = (|ξ0|\r
2 − |ξ1|2\r
)φ1(z) < 0\r
Thus φ1 < φ0 by comparison principle.\r
As ξ → 0, the solution φ of (7.3) converges to φ ≡ 1, so s(0) = 0. We leave the question if\r
every radially symmetric symbol s such that s(0) = 0 and it is monotone increasing with respect\r
to |ξ| can be obtained by a suitable choice of a(z).\r
