The bracket operation on mutually local BRST classes may be combined with Lorentz\r
invariance and analyticity to write an infinite set of finite difference relations on string\r
scattering amplitudes. When combined with some simple physical criteria these relations\r
uniquely determine the genus zero stringS-matrix forN≤ 26-particle scattering in IR25\r
,1\r
in terms of a single parameter,κ, the string coupling. We propose that the high-energy\r
limit of the relations are the Ward identities for the high-energy symmetries of string\r
theory.\r

1. Introduction\r
String theory is a generalization of gauge theory. Historically, understanding the\r
importance of general covariance and local isotopic-spin invariance were crucial steps in the\r
formulation of general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. One might therefore suspect that\r
a complete formulation of string theory will be predicated upon a deeper understanding\r
of the symmetries in the theory.\r
In [1] D. Gross proposed that one useful tool for discovering fundamental string sym\u0002metries is the analysis of the high energy behavior of string scattering amplitudes. In field\r
theories of spontaneously broken gauge invariance this technique works very well. Using\r
the saddle-point analysis of [2] Gross derived an infinite set of linear relations between\r
bosonic string 4-particle S-matrix amplitudes. Usually linear relations between scattering\r
amplitudes are derived from an underlying symmetry, and it was suggested in [1] that such\r
a symmetry must explain these linear relations. Some work has subsequently been done\r
with a view towards understanding this mysterious symmetry in [3] [4] [5].\r
In [6] it was suggested that the infinite dimensional hyperbolic symmetries which arise\r
upon toroidal compactification of time might be the source of the high energy symmetries\r
of string theory. The original program of [6] is probably misguided, for reasons explained\r
in appendix B below. Nevertheless, as we show in the present paper, the basic idea that\r
generalized Kac-Moody algebras are high-energy symmetries of string theory is correct. In\r
fact, more is true. We can replace high energy Ward identities, which relate amplitudes\r
at the same values of s, t by finite difference relations for the exact amplitudes. These\r
finite difference relations put strong constraints on the genus zero string S-matrix. We\r
will show that they determine scattering amplitudes at all mass levels in terms of tachyon\r
scattering. Moreover, when supplemented with some mild analyticity requirements (e.g.\r
Regge-like behavior at s → ∞) the finite difference relations even determine the tachyon\r
amplitude itself. A technical point discussed in section 3.3 limits our discussion to N\u0002particle scattering for N ≤ 26.\r
In essence the answer to the problem posed in [1] is very simple: the underlying\r
symmetries are the bracket algebras defined by on-shell mutually local BRST invariant\r
chiral vertex operators.\r
2. Review of Bosonic String Scattering\r
It is convenient to summarize some standard facts [7].\r
1

2.1. On-Shell States\r
The states of the open bosonic string are defined in terms of the BRST cohomology\r
H∗[7][8]. We focus on the chiral ghost number 1 cohomology, H = Hg=1. The space H is\r
graded by level number n and momentum p ∈ IR25,1:\r
H = ⊕n∈ZZ+\r
Z\r
IR25,1\r
dp H[p, n] (2.1)\r
where H[p, n] = 0 unless p\r
2 = 2 − 2n and dim H[p, n] = p24(n). H is an induced represen\u0002tation of the Poincar´e group in IR25,1\r
.\r
Cohomology classes have representatives of the form cV where V is a chiral vertex\r
operator satisfying the physical state conditions. These conditions state that V is a di\u0002mension one Virasoro primary. 1 Such operators have the form V = Pe\r
ipX where P is a\r
polynomial in ∂\r
∗X of dimension n. For example:\r
n = 0 : P = 1\r
n = 1 : P = iζ · ∂X ζ ∈ TIR25,1\r
ζ · p = 0 ζ ∼ ζ + λp\r
n = 2 : P = ip · ζ · ∂\r
2X + ∂X · ζ · ∂X ζ ∈\r

2\r
.\r
We use units where α\r
′ =\r
1\r
2\r
for open string amplitudes. Polarization tensors, or multiplets\r
of polarization tensors are generically denoted by ζ.\r
2.2. S-Matrix Amplitudes\r
S-matrix amplitudes are multilinear functions A : H⊗n → C constructed as follows.\r
The operator formalism associates a measure Ω(V1, . . . Vn) on the moduli space F of ordered\r
points on the boundary of the unit disk. We define A =\r
R\r
F Ω. By Mobius invariance of Ω,\r
A is invariant under cyclic permutations.\r
1 The ghosts will not play an essential role in this paper so we will often identify a class with\r
V .\r
2

The definition of R\r
F Ω requires some care. Using Mobius invariance of Ω we transform\r
the disk to the upper half plane and write:\r
A(V1, . . . Vn) = κ\r
n−2\r
Z\r
Fn−3([0,1])\r
nY−2\r
2\r
dyih0|Vn(yn)Vn−1(yn−1)· · · V1(y1)|0i (2.3)\r
where yn = ∞, yn−1 = 1, y1 = 0 and Fn−3([0, 1]) is the moduli space of n−3 ordered points\r
on the interval. The integral (2.3) is given meaning as follows. The integrand is a function\r
of the yi and of the relativistic invariants sij ≡ pi· pj . It follows from the o.p.e. that there\r
is a domain where Re(sij) is sufficiently large and positive, or negative, (depending on ij)\r
so that the integral is absolutely convergent and defines a holomorphic function of the sij .\r
The analytic continuation from this domain defines an amplitude which is a meromorphic\r
function of the sij .\r
It will be important to specify clearly the independent relativistic invariants that A\r
depends upon. These invariants are formed out of momenta pi and polarization tensors\r
ζi. Relativistic invariants formed from the pi alone parametrize the different orbits of\r
SO(1, d − 1) on the space of n − 1 independent momenta. Taking into consideration the\r
relevant little group we see that the number of independent relativistic invariants for n\r
particle scattering in d dimensions is\r
nd −\r
1\r
2\r
d(d + 1) for n ≥ d + 1\r
1\r
2\r
n(n − 1) for n ≤ d + 1\r
(2.4)\r
For n ≤ d a set of algebraically independent invariants can be chosen to be an ap\u0002propriate collection of the sij. For example, we may choose sij for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤\r
n − 1. (We make a different choice below.) For n ≥ d + 1 the story is more com\u0002plicated. By classical invariant theory [9] the ring of polynomial invariants is gener\u0002ated by the sij and by [p\r
i1\r
, . . . , pid ] = ǫ\r

]p\r
iσ(d+1) ·p\r
j = 0 [10]. Thus for n ≥ d+1\r
a maximal algebraically independent set of invariants can be taken to be an appropriate\r
set of sij together with [p\r
1\r
, . . . , pd].\r
We separate the independent relativistic invariants into three types:\r
• Levels of the particles: p\r
2\r
i = 2 − 2ni\r
, i = 1, . . . n\r
• Scalar product invariants. According to the above discussion for n ≤ d these can be\r
taken to be the sij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2, together with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3, j = n − 1 . For\r
n ≥ d + 1 we must choose an appropriate set of n(d − 1) −\r
1\r
2\r
d(d + 1) − 1 sij ’s.\r

• Polarization invariants. These are formed from contractions of the ζ’s with themselves or\r
the ζ’s with p’s. The only way the relativistic invariants [p\r
i1\r
, . . . , pid ] can enter a (bosonic)\r
string amplitude is through the polarization invariants.\r
Example: The case n = 4 is of particular importance. This is the function A :\r
H⊗4 → C given by:\r
A(V1, V2, V3, V4) = κ\r
2\r
Z 1\r
0\r
dzh0|V4(∞)V3(1)V2(z)V1(0)|0i (2.5)\r
The kinematic invariants are s = p1 · p2, t = p2 · p3. We let\r
\u001A\r
ζ1 ζ2 ζ3 ζ4\r
p1 p2 p3 p4\r
\u001B\r
(2.6)\r
stand for an ordered set of independent polarization invariants. 2 Thus,the amplitudes are\r
functions with independent arguments:\r

2.3. Analyticity Properties\r
As an analytic function A is a polynomial in the polarization invariants. The coeffi\u0002cients of this polynomial are meromorphic functions of the sij. One of the goals of this\r
paper is to replace the complicated formula (2.3) by a symmetry principle. We will need\r
to take the following three analyticity properties as axiomatic:\r
AP1: Location of poles. The dual diagrams of the genus zero open string amplitudes are\r
binary trees rooted at the center of the unit disk with ordered terminal vertices on the\r
boundary of the disk as in:\r
2 We choose a lexicographic ordering, with ζ in front of p.\r

2+f2; 0; 2; : : :g\r
Each terminal vertex carries an ingoing momentum pi. Using momentum conservation\r
we associate a momentum pI with each internal edge I. We assume that the amplitudes can\r
only have poles when p\r
2\r
I ∈ {2, 0, −2, −4, . . .} for some I in some dual diagram. Explicitly,\r
this is the condition that (pi + · · ·+ pi+k)\r
2 ∈ {2, 0, −2, −4, . . .} for some i, k, where indices\r
are understood modulo n.\r
The proof that the n-point amplitudes (2.3) satisfy the axiom AP1 makes use of the\r
operator product expansion and Mobius invariance of Ω.\r
AP2: Growth at infinity. We assume that the amplitude has at most power law growth\r
as any sij tends to infinity, holding all other independent kinematic invariants fixed. This\r
is a generalization of Regge behavior.\r
The axiom AP2 can be motivated by considering the n-tachyon scattering amplitude:\r
A = κ\r

nY−2\r
2\r
dyiθ(yi − yi−1)\r
Y\r
1≤i<j≤n−1\r
(yj − yi)\r
sij (2.8)\r
where yn−1 = 1, y1 = 0. The standard argument [11] proceeds as follows. If Re(sij) → +∞\r
then since all the factors in the product in (2.8) are ≤ 1 the integration is dominated by\r
the region where those factors raised to a power sij are near one. Making an exponential\r
change of variables and isolating this region proves the claim. As the simplest example\r
5

of this argument, suppose we take the sij appearing in (2.8) as independent variables\r
(s1,n−1 will be considered dependent). Consider the limit Re(s12) → +∞ holding all other\r
independent sij fixed. We write y2 = e\r
−x2 and the integral is dominated by the region\r
x2 ∼ 0. Making this approximation in the rest of the integrand we find the asymptotics\r
s\r
−s2,n−1\r
12 . In general we find\r
A ∼ αs\r
β\r
ij\r
where β is a combination of the other skl’s. This argument extends to any correlation\r
function and justifies the axiom AP2.\r
Finally we need an axiom that relates the amplitudes for different values of n. These\r
are the well-known and standard tree-level unitarity equations:\r
AP3: Factorization. If we cut a dual diagram on some internal edge I we decompose it\r
into two dual diagrams I1, I2. We assume that when p\r
2\r
I → 2−2nI and other momenta are\r
in general position the residue at the pole is\r
X\r
a,b\r
A(Vi, . . . , Vi+k, Va)G\r
abA(Vb, Vi+k+1, . . . , Vi−1) (2.9)\r
where {Va} is a basis for H[pI , nI ] and Gab is the inverse of the positive definite metric on\r
H[pI , nI] whose existence is assured by the no-ghost theorem.\r
The proof that property AP3 is satisfied again makes use of the operator product\r
expansion.\r
Remark: In stating the factorization axiom we have not made any use of a complex\r
structure or of local coordinates on the disk. One could state a stronger factorization\r
axiom valid for all values of the momenta. This requires the introduction of the full off\u0002shell BRST chain complex and the introduction of local coordinates. We will not need\r
that in the present paper.\r
2.4. High Energy-Fixed Angle Scattering\r
We define s = p1 ·p2 ≡ −2E\r
2\r
, and t = p2 ·p3 ≡ 2E\r
2\r
sin2 1\r
2\r
θ. In the limit of high energy\r
scattering, where all masses are effectively zero, E and θ have the physical interpretation of\r
center of mass energy and scattering angle. In the plane of scattering the spatial momenta\r
look like:\r

The high energy limit is defined to be the limit where E\r
2 → ∞ along any ray other\r
than the positive or negative real axis, holding θ and all other independent relativistic\r
invariants fixed. 3\r
Gross and Mende studied the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes in the high-energy\r
limit [2]. The amplitudes are dominated by a saddle point. For open strings: 4\r

2\r
θ.\r
The proof of (2.10) may be obtained by combining Stirling’s formula with the analytic\r
structure of the amplitudes described above. Alternatively, one may use a saddle point\r
analysis of either the integral over moduli space or of the path integral. The saddle point\r
typically lies outside the domain of integration, and for good reason. The true high energy\r
asymptotics obtained by taking E2 → ∞ along the positive real axis must encounter an\r
infinite set of poles when any intermediate state goes onshell. These poles are manifestly\r
absent from (2.10). The saddle point analysis applies to the asymptotics of analytically\r
continued S-matrix elements. This is important to bear in mind when considering gener\u0002alizations to n ≥ 5 point functions and to higher orders of string perturbation theory, in\r
which case one probably must consider asymptotics only for E2 → ±i∞.\r
3 Warning: this differs slightly from the α\r
′ → ∞ limit of [1], since we hold expressions of the\r
form ζ · p\r
k\r
constant, even for polarizations with longitudinal components.\r
4 The result is BRST invariant despite appearances. The choice of the point z0 magically\r
cancels all differences arising from different choices of representative P for the cohomology class.\r

3. Bracket Relations\r
3.1. Bracket\r
Two years ago it was shown that the BRST cohomology of 2D string theory has\r
a rich algebraic structure related to BV quantization [12] [13] [14]. Subsequently, Lian\r
and Zuckerman studied the algebraic structures of the BRST cohomology based on an\r
arbitrary chiral algebra (=vertex operator algebra [15]) in [16] [17]. As shown by Lian and\r
Zuckerman, there is an operation {·, ·} : Hg1 × Hg2 → Hg1+g2−1 which they called the\r
“Gerstenhaber bracket.” The bracket is very fundamental: it exists for arbitrary bosonic\r
string cohomology and plays a role related to the BV anti-bracket for the on-shell BV\r
structure of string theory. In the present case we may identify ghost number 1 classes with\r
chiral physical state operators and the bracket is simply the standard “commutator” of\r
dimension one currents:\r
J ⊗ V → {J, V }(z) ≡\r
I\r
z\r
dwJ(w)V (z) (3.1)\r
In general, the ghost number one cohomology based on a chiral algebra is a Lie algebra.\r
In our case H in (2.1) is not based on a chiral algebra because the fields have mon\u0002odromy when considered as chiral vertex operators. Nevertheless, when J, V are mutually\r
local (3.1) still makes sense. 5In particular, given two momenta p, q with q\r
2 = 2 − 2n1,\r
p\r
2 = 2 − 2n2, (p + q)2 = 2 − 2n3. we have a map:\r
{·, ·} : H[q, n1] ⊗ H[p, n2] → H[p + q, n3]\r
We may extend the bracket to all of H:\r
{·, ·} : H ⊗ H → H\r
by defining it to be zero on pairs not mutually local. 6\r
The bracket has the two properties:\r
B1. If p1, p2 are the momenta of V1, V2 then:\r
{V1, V2} = −(−1)p1·p2 {V2, V1}\r
5\r
In this paper “mutually local” means the o.p.e. has only integral powers of z − w. Equiva\u0002lently, the monodromy is trivial (although the braiding matrix could be (−1)).\r
6 Alternatively, one can take the point of view that the bracket is only defined on some pairs of\r
states. That is, it is like multiplication in a groupoid, or composition of morphisms in a category.\r
8

B2. If V1, V2, V3 are all pairwise mutually local then:\r
(−1)p1·p3 {V1, {V2, V3}} + (−1)p3·p2 {V3, {V1, V2}} + (−1)p2·p1 {V2, {V3, V1}} = 0 (3.2)\r
Unfortunately (3.2) does not hold for all triples in H.\r
The bracket on ghost number one cohomology generalizes the Lie algebra of the Ger\u0002stenhaber bracket in two ways. First, property B1 shows that the bracket is “vectorially\u0002graded.” Second, the vectorially-graded Jacobi relation only holds for mutually local\r
triples.\r
A table of useful structure constants for {·, ·} can be found in appendix A.\r
3.2. Relations\r
Let J be any chiral physical state operator of momentum q and let Vi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 be\r
chiral physical state operators of momenta pi such that q +\r
Ppi = 0. Assume that q · pi\r
are integral so that J and Vi are mutually local. 7In this case we can regard the integrand\r
of (2.5) as a correlator of chiral vertex operators for conformal field theory on the plane.\r
Using standard contour deformation arguments we derive the identity\r
0 = h0|V4(∞)V3(1)V2(z){J, V1}(0)|0i\r
+(−1)q·p2h0|V4(∞)V3(1){J, V2}(z)V1(0)|0i\r
+(−1)q·p2+q·p3h0|V4(∞){J, V3}(1)V2(z)V1(0)|0i\r
+ (−1)q·p2+q·p3+q·p4\r
h0|{J, V4}(∞)V3(1)V2(z)V1(0)|0i\r
(3.3)\r
Now we simply integrate z from 0 to 1, assuming that Re(s) and Re(t) are sufficiently\r
positive that the integral is absolutely convergent. This gives the finite difference relations:\r

7 We do not assume that the Vi are mutually local.\r
9

Here ˜n,\r
˜ζ refer to the transformed operator under the bracket.\r
The relations (3.4) are finite difference equations relating scattering amplitudes for\r
particles at different mass levels. The essential content of these identities is displayed by a\r
matrix of the levels of the states involved. Each row of the matrix encodes the level-number\r
of the states in an amplitude. The general Ward identity is associated with a matrix of\r
the form:\r
\r
\r
n˜1 n2 n3 n4\r
n1 n˜2 n3 n4\r
n1 n2 n˜3 n4\r
n1 n2 n3 n˜4\r
\r
 (3.5)\r
Here integers ni ≥ 0, are levels of the untransformed particles, while the integers ˜ni are\r
the levels of the transformed particles. The level nJ of the symmetry current J is easily\r
extracted from the sum of the diagonal minus the anti-diagonal:\r
Xn˜i −Xni = −q\r
2 = 2nJ − 2 (3.6)\r
If ˜niis negative then {J, V } = 0 and the corresponding amplitude simply vanishes.\r
This procedure generalizes to N-particle scattering. Whenever J of momentum q is\r
mutually local w.r.t all the pi and q +\r
Ppi = 0 we have an identity\r

(−1)q·p2+···q·piA\r
\r
V1, . . . , {J, Vi}, . . . VN\r
\u0001\r
= 0 (3.7)\r
These relations are subject to an important technical restriction discussed in the next\r
section.\r
Remark: Although we have used currents J to derive relations on amplitudes, they\r
are not unbroken symmetry currents in the theory since there are many operators in the\r
BRST cohomology which are not mutually local w.r.t. any given J. Nevertheless, using\r
Lorentz invariance and analyticity we are still able to derive relations on amplitudes.\r
3.3. Existence of required momenta\r
The identities (3.4) would be of little use if one could rarely choose momenta in the way\r
we have indicated. In this section we show that we can always find momenta corresponding\r
to any prescription of the levels and kinematic invariants (at least, for N ≤ d = 26). In\r
doing so it is necessary to allow the momenta to be complex. We may do this since the\r
BRST conditions and the vertex operator calculus make perfect sense when momenta are\r
complex.\r
10

Lemma. Suppose N ≤ d. For any complex numbers ni\r
, ˜ni, i = 1, . . . N, and 1\r
2N(N − 3)\r
complex numbers zij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N − 2, z1,N−1, . . . zN−3,N−1, there exist momenta 8\r
p1, . . . , pN ∈ Cˆ\r

such that, if we define q ≡ −Ppi then\r

X\r
j:j6=i\r
pj\r
\u00012\r
= 2 − 2˜ni (3.8b)\r
pi· pj = zij (3.8c)\r
Proof: For N ≤ d the invariants sij made from N momenta pi are algebraically\r
independent. It is straightforward to solve (3.8 )as a linear system of equations to find the\r
pi· pj in terms of linear combinations of the ni, n˜i, zij . We can regard the equations for\r
pi· pj as equations for the intersection of 1\r
2N(N + 1) quadrics in IPNd. These intersect in\r
a variety of codimension at most 1\r
2N(N + 1) [18]. Even if this variety lies at infinity we\r
can use the solution - we simply must take a momentum → ∞ limit in the amplitudes. ♠\r
The different sets of polarization invariants in (3.4) are polynomially related. There\u0002fore, using the analyticity of A we conclude that (3.4) holds for all values of s, t and\r
all polarization tensors satisfying these polynomial relations. Similarly, provided ni, nJ\r
are positive integers and ˜ni are integers, we can find momenta for arbitrary kinematic\r
invariants for which the identities (3.7) can be written.\r
Unfortunately one cannot generalize the lemma to the case N > d. For N ≥ d + 1\r
the sij are not algebraically indpendent, hence we cannot specify arbitrarily the ni, n˜i and\r
independent sij, i 6= j (for N-particle scattering).\r
We are therefore stuck with the rather distasteful limitation to N-particle scattering\r
for N ≤ d.\r
3.4. High Energy Limit\r
Combining (2.10) with (3.4) we obtain the high energy identities:\r
0 =z\r
p2·q\r
0 A\r
s.p.({J, V1}, V2, V3, V4)\r
+(−1)q·p2z\r

p2·qAs.p.(V1, V2, {J, V3}, V4)\r
+(−1)q·p1A\r
s.p.(V1, V2, V3, {J, V4})\r
(3.9)\r

where z0 = s/(s + t) = 1/ cos2 1\r
2\r
θ, 1 − z0 = t/(s + t) = − tan2 1\r
2\r
θ, and each amplitude in\r
(3.9) is evaluated at the same value of s, t. We take s, t → ∞ holding q · pi fixed. The\r
amplitude As.p. in (2.10) has the form RU where R is a rational function of s, t and\r

\u001B (3.10)\r
Shifts such as s, t → s + q · p2, t + q · p3 lead to an order one change in the amplitude from\r
the exponential factor in (3.10), leading to the “extra” powers of z0, 1 − z0 in (3.9). The\r
change δz0 in the position of the saddle-point in moduli space is O\r
\r
1/s, 1/t, 1/(s + t)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
Similarly, the shifts in s, t change the rational function R by terms of the same order.\r
Hence (3.9) holds up to factors 1 + O\r
\r
1/s, 1/t, 1/(s + t)\r
\u0001\r
.\r
4. Six Examples\r
Example 1: The simplest example of (3.4) has level matrix:\r
\r
\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 −2\r
\r
 (4.1)\r
From the entries we read off that this is a “tachyonic identity,” i.e. q\r
2 = 2. We also can\r
read off:\r
p\r
2\r
i = 2 p1 · q = p2 · q = p3 · q = −1 p4 · q = +1\r
Using (A.1) of appendix A we see that (3.4) implies\r
A(s − 1, t) + A(s, t − 1) = A(s − 1, t − 1) (4.2)\r
where A is the basic Veneziano amplitude A0000 = A(s, t) for scattering of four states at\r
level 0.\r
Example 2: Consider the level matrix:\r
\r
\r
1 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 −1\r
\r
 (4.3)\r
12

This encodes a lightlike Ward identity with J = iζ1 · ∂Xeiq·X and q\r
2 = 0. It relates γT T T\r
scattering to T T T T scattering, where γ refers to the level one photon and T refers to the\r
level zero tachyon. For the γT T T amplitude (2.7) simplifies to:\r
A1000(ζ1 · p2, ζ1 · p3|s, t)\r
From (4.3) we read off\r
p\r
2\r
1 = p\r
2\r
2 =p\r
2\r
3 = p\r
2\r
4 = 2\r
p1 · q = −1 p2 · q = p3 · q = 0 p4 · q = +1\r
Using (A.3) we have:\r
A1000(ζ1 · p2, ζ1 · p3|s, t) = −ζ1 · p2A(s − 1, t) − ζ1 · p3A(s, t) (4.4)\r
From (3.9) we see that at high energies γT T T scattering is related to tachyon scattering\r
via\r
0 = A\r
s.p.\r
1000(ζ1 · p2, ζ1 · p3|s, t) + (1 + t/s)ζ1 · p2A\r
s.p.(s, t) + ζ1 · p3As.p.(s, t) (4.5)\r
Similarly, one easily derives relations on similar amplitudes. For example:\r
A0100(ζ2 · p1, ζ2 · p3|s, t) = ζ2 · p1A(s − 1, t) − ζ2 · p3A(s, t − 1) (4.6)\r
Example 3: We now consider the level matrix\r
\r
\r
1 1 0 0\r
0 1 0 0\r
0 1 0 0\r
0 1 0 −1\r
\r
 (4.7)\r
again giving a lightlike Ward identity. This relates γγT T to γT T T scattering.\r
We consider the γγT T amplitude to be a function of seven arguments:\r
A1100(ζ1 · ζ2, ζ1 · p2, ζ1 · p3, ζ2 · p1, ζ2 · p3|s, t)\r
Using (A.3) and (A.5) (3.4) becomes (after shifting arguments and setting ζ2 · q = 0):\r
A1100(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5|s, t) = −A0100(x2x4 − x1, x2x5|s − 1, t)\r
− x3A0100(x4, x5, s, t)\r
= (x1 − x2x4)A(s − 2, t)+x2x5A(s − 1, t − 1) − x3x4A(s − 1, t)\r
+ x3x5A(s, t − 1)\r
(4.8)\r
13

Which has the high energy limit:\r
A\r
s.p.\r
1100(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5|s, t) = −(1 + t/s)A\r
s.p.\r
0100(x2x4 − x1, x2x5|s, t)\r
− x3A\r
s.p.\r
0100(x4, x5|s, t)\r
(4.9)\r
Notice that if we were restricted to using real momenta and polarizations then p\r
2 =\r
q\r
2 = p · q = 0 ⇒ p k q and we would not derive relations on the most general amplitude\r
(e.g. s would be fixed). This is not true if we use complex momenta. After we derive the\r
Ward identity we can specialize to physical values of the relativistic invariants, and, as in\r
(4.9), solve for the amplitude in terms of previously known amplitudes.\r
Example 4: We now consider\r
\r
\r
1 1 0 0\r
1 1 0 0\r
1 1 1 0\r
1 1 0 −1\r
\r
 (4.10)\r
which will express A1110 in terms of amplitudes at lower total level. The ordered set of\r
relativistic invariants in A1110 is:\r
\u001A\r
ζ1 ζ2 ζ3 1\r
p1 p2 p3 p4\r
\u001B\r
= {ζ1 · ζ2, ζ1 · ζ3, ζ2 · ζ3, ζ1 ·p2, ζ1 ·p3, ζ2 ·p1, ζ2 ·p3, ζ3 ·p1, ζ3 ·p2} (4.11)\r
Following the procedure of the previous two examples we get:\r
A1110(x1, . . . , x9|s, t) = A1100(x1x8, x4x8, x5x8 − x2, x6, x7|s, t)\r
+ A1100(x1x9, x4, x5, x6x9, x7x9 − x3|s, t − 1)\r
(4.12)\r
which has the high energy limit:\r
A\r
s.p.\r
1110(x1, . . . , x9|s, t) = A\r
s.p.\r
1100(x1x8, x4x8, x5x8 − x2, x6, x7|s, t)\r
+ (1 + s/t)A\r
s.p.\r
1100(x1x9, x4, x5, x6x9, x7x9 − x3|s, t)\r
(4.13)\r
Example 5: We take\r
\r
\r
1 1 1 0\r
1 1 1 0\r
1 1 0 0\r
1 1 1 1\r
\r
 (4.14)\r
which will relate the 4-photon amplitude to the tachyon amplitude. We now need the\r
bracket (A.4)\r
14

The ordered set of relativistic invariants occurring in A1111 is:\r
\u001A\r
ζ1 ζ2 ζ3 ζ4\r
p1 p2 p3 p4\r
\u001B\r
= {ζ1 · ζ2,ζ1 · ζ3, ζ1 · ζ4, ζ2 · ζ3, ζ2 · ζ4, ζ3 · ζ4,\r
ζ1 · p2, ζ1·p3, ζ2 · p1, ζ2 · p3, ζ3 · p1, ζ3 · p2, ζ4 · p1, ζ4 · p2}\r
(4.15)\r
So the four-photon amplitude is a function of 16 arguments, and (3.4) becomes\r
A1111(x1, . . . ,, x14|s, t)\r
= −A1110(x1x13, x2x13, x4, x7x13, x8x13 + x3, x9, x10, x11, x12|s, t)\r
−A1110(x1x14, x2, x4x14, x7, x8, x9x14, x10x14 + x5, x11, x12|s, t + 1)\r
+x6A1100(x1, x7, x8, x9, x10|s, t)\r

+x6A\r
s.p.\r
1100(x1, x7, x8, x9, x10|s, t)\r
(4.17)\r
Example 6: As a final example we look at a timelike identity with level matrix:\r
\r
\r
2 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
0 0 0 0\r
\r
 (4.18)\r
Hence q\r
2 = −2 and\r
J = Vζ,q ≡\r

(4.19)\r
We parametrize the scattering of 1 level 2 on 3 level 0 states by the function of 8 variables:\r
A2000(p1 · ζ · p1, p1 · ζ · p2, p1 · ζ · p3, p2 · ζ · p2, p2 · ζ · p3, p3 · ζ · p3|s, t) (4.20)\r
Now we use the bracket in (A.6). After shifting arguments a little one finds the bracket\r
relation:\r
A2000(p1 · ζ · p1, . . . p3 · ζ · p3|s, t) = −(p2 · ζ · p2 + p1 · ζ · p2)A(s − 2, t + 1)\r
+ (p3 · ζ · p3 + p1 · ζ · p3)A(s − 1, t + 1)\r
−(p3 · ζ · p3 + p1 · ζ · p3+p2 · ζ · p2 + p1 · ζ · p2 + 2p2 · ζ · p3)A(s − 1, t)\r

As an exercise the reader may care to work out some futuristic identities for A2001.\r
5. Determination of Tachyon Amplitudes\r
In the previous section we saw that the relations (3.4) lead to a host of interlevel\r
amplitude identities. In the present section we discuss finite difference relations on the\r
tachyon amplitudes themselves. We show that relations (3.4)(3.7) together with the an\u0002alyticity properties AP1,AP2 determine the N- tachyon scattering amplitudes up to an\r
overall constant cN .\r
5.1. Derivation of the Veneziano formula\r
Example one of the previous section has already produced one identity on the tachyon\r
scattering amplitude A(s, t). The relation (4.2) by itself is not sufficiently strong to de\u0002termine the function A. However, we can combine it with (4.6) using the decoupling of\r
BRST trivial states. Decoupling of the longitudinal photon implies that A0100(s, t|s, t) = 0.\r
Combining this with (4.6) we get\r
sA(s − 1, t) = tA(s, t − 1) (5.1)\r
Now the recursion relations (4.2) and (5.1) determine the value of A for s, t ∈ ZZ+ to be\r
given by the Veneziano formula:\r
A0000 = A(s, t) = c4\r
Γ(s + 1)Γ(t + 1)\r
Γ(s + t + 2) (5.2)\r
where c4 = A(0, 0) is assumed nonzero.\r
In order to obtain the amplitude for all s, t we must “analytically continue from the\r
integers,” an idea familiar from studies of the S-matrix in D = 2 spacetime dimensions.\r
(For reviews see [19]. ) It is at this point that we must invoke the analyticity properties\r
AP1,AP2 of section 2.3.\r
16

Let us define\r
A(s, t) = c4\r
Γ(s + 1)Γ(t + 1)\r
Γ(s + t + 2) A˜(s, t) (5.3)\r
The functional equations for A imply that A˜(s, t) is periodic of period one in both s, t.\r
Moreover, by AP1 it is an entire function. By AP2, the entire function A˜ is of expo\u0002nential type [20]. A periodic entire function of exponential type must be a trigonometric\r
polynomial [20], that is:\r
A˜(s, t) = X\r
n,m\r
cn,me\r
2πi(ns+mt)\r
where the sum is finite. Now applying AP2 again we see that A˜ must in fact be constant,\r
so A˜ = 1.\r
In conclusion, with a mild analyticity assumption we see that the Veneziano amplitude\r
is fixed by symmetry.\r
5.2. n-particle scattering, n ≤ 26\r
The above procedure can be extended to higher point functions, although the amount\r
of work involved goes up rapidly with n. We take the independent kinematic variables to\r
be sij for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2 and si,n−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 3. The equation\r
2 − n =\r
X\r
1≤i<j≤n−1\r
sij (5.4)\r
expresses sn−2,n−1 in terms of the other invariants. It is often useful to think of the\r
variables as an upper triangular matrix:\r
s =\r
\r
\r

0 · · · ∗ sn−2,n−1\r
0 · · · 0 0 ∗\r
\r
\r
(5.5)\r
where sn−2,n−1 is not an independent variable but is fixed by (5.4).\r
The tachyon amplitudes are functions on the space of upper triangular matrices (5.5)\r
defined by (2.8).\r
The generalization of (4.2) is\r
A(. . . , sab, . . . , sac, . . . , sbc, . . .) =A(. . . ,(sab − 1), . . . ,(sac + 1), . . . , sbc, . . .)\r
−A(. . . ,(sab − 1), . . .,(sac), . . . ,(sbc + 1), . . .)\r
(5.6)\r
17

which holds ∀a, b, c such that 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ n−1 where all other variables in the ellipsis\r
are held fixed. We call these “triangle relations” since they relate a triangle of variables in\r
(5.5).\r
Using the triangle relations one easily reduces an arbitrary tachyon amplitude for\r
sij ∈ ZZ+, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2 to the case where:\r
s =\r
\r
\r
∗ 0 0 · · · 0 s1,n−1\r
0 ∗ 0 · · · 0 s2,n−1\r

0 · · · 0 ∗ sn−2,n−1\r
0 · · · 0 0 0 ∗\r
\r
\r
We denote a tachyon amplitude evaluated for such a set of invariants by the function\r
F(s1,n−1, . . . sn−3,n−1).\r
Next, one may write lightlike relations connecting A0···010···0 to tachyon scattering.\r
As above, one can put A0···010···0 to zero by evaluating at special polarization invariants\r
corresponding to longitudinal photons. In this way we obtain a set of n − 1 relations for\r
the function F. These equations are:\r
0 = X\r

of the nonzero entries, and the last entry of an n − 2 vector is dropped in the argument of\r
F. We have two additional identities for a = n − 2:\r

As we will show below, these equations are sufficient to determine the functional\r
dependence of F for sij ∈ ZZ, up to a finite set of arbitrary constants. The remaining\r
undetermined constants can be fixed (up to one overall scale) by use of the axiom AP1.\r
We illustrate this by giving the general solution to the functional equations (5.7)(5.8)(5.9)\r
for the case of the 5-particle function. We then give the general argument.\r
5.3. 5-particle function\r
The functional equations become\r

(x + y + 2)F(x, y) = xF(x − 1, y) + yF(x, y − 1)\r
(5.10)\r
The equations must be evaluated in the quadrant x = −2 − a, y = −2 − b, a, b ≥ 0,\r
otherwise the amplitude might have poles. The general solution to (5.10) in this quadrant\r
is easily found to be\r
F(x, y) =\r
2\r
\u0014\r
4β + (3α − 4β)x + (8β − 3α)y)\r
\u0015\r
(x + 1)(y + 1)(x + y + 2) (5.11)\r
where α, β are undetermined. By AP1 we only allow poles in x or in x + y ( since y itself\r
is not related to the squared momentum in any channel). This requirement fixes 3α = 4β\r
so that\r
F(x, y) = 6α\r

where s34 is defined by (5.4).\r
Equation (5.13) is derived for integral values of sij . In order to “continue” to all values\r
of sij we must combine results on entire functions with the analyticity property AP2 of\r
section 2.3, as in the previous section. This is straightforward when s13 = 0. In the\r
general case we must use a Mellin-Barnes representation for 3F2 to establish appropriate\r
asymptotics.\r
The formula (5.13) can actually be derived directly from the integral representation\r
(2.8) using formulae in, e.g., [21]. Similar formulae have appeared in a different context in\r
[22].\r
5.4. 6 ≤ n ≤ 26\r
The above discussion generalizes to n- particle scattering for 6 ≤ n ≤ 26. The\r
analyticity property AP1 combined with the functional equation (5.9) is sufficiently strong\r
to obtain the general formula.\r
We now prove this. To begin we use (5.9) with s2 = s3 = · · · = 0:\r
s1F(s1 − 1,~0) = (n − 3 + s1)F(s1,~0) (5.14)\r
which implies\r
F(s1,~0) = c\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + n − 3) (5.15)\r
where c is a constant. Now given F(s1,~0) we can again use (5.9) to derive\r
F(s1, 1,~0) = c1s1 + c2\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + n − 2) (5.16)\r
where c1, c2 are constants. We can carry on in this way and easily establish by induction\r
that if s2, s3, . . . are nonnegative integers then\r
F(s1, s2, . . . sn−3) = P\r
s2,...sn−3 (s1)\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + s2 + · · · + sn−3 + n − 3) (5.17)\r
20

where P\r
s2,...sn−3 (s1) is a polynomial of degree s2 + · · · + sn−3.\r
Now, as with the 5pt function we can fix the coefficients of the polynomial by invoking\r
AP1. By AP1 the function F(~s) can only have poles when\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}\r
s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}\r
s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 + s3,n−1 ∈ {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, . . .}\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
s1,n−1 + · · · sn−3,n−1 ∈ {−(n − 3), −(n − 4), . . .}\r
(5.18)\r
Therefore, the polynomial in the numerator of (5.17) must cancel the poles:\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 1, . . . , −2}\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 3, . . . , −s2 − s3 − 2}\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − · · · − sn−4 − (n − 3), . . . , −s2 − · · · − sn−3 − (n − 4)}\r
(5.19)\r
This fixes all the constants in P up to an overall scale and we obtain the result\r
F(~s) = cn\r
nY−3\r
j=1\r
−1\r
j +\r
Pj\r
ℓ=1 sℓ,n−1\r
(5.20)\r
which can also be checked directly from the integral representation (2.8).\r
One can proceed from here to evaluate the general tachyon amplitude using the tri\u0002angle relations and AP2. The result after “putting back” s12, s23, . . . sn−3,n−2 is still a\r
product of gamma functions. The general result is a multiple hypergeometric function of\r
1\r
2\r
(n − 3)(n − 4) arguments. For example, the six-point function turns out to be:\r
X\r
j1,j2,j3≥0\r
(−s14)j1(−s24)j2(−s13)j3\r
j1!j2!j3!\r
Γ(−s12 − s13 − s14 − s15 + j1 + j3)\r
Γ(1 − s13 − s14 − s15 + j1 + j3)\r
×\r
Γ(4 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3)\r
Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3)\r
Γ(1 + s12)Γ(1 + s23)Γ(1 + s34)\r
Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2)\r
(5.21)\r
Multiple hypergeometric functions have been studied to some extent in the literature, see,\r
e.g., [21]. In order to apply AP2 we must give a Mellin-Barnes representation to series\r
like (5.21) to establish the appropriate asymptotics in sij . We have not carried out this\r
procedure in complete detail, but fully expect that it can be done.\r
21

6. S is unique\r
We now argue that the solution to the bracket relations is essentially unique.\r
6.1. 4-particle S-matrix\r
We begin by showing that the identities (3.4) completely fix the 4-particle S-matrix\r
for all particles in terms of the level zero S-matrix A(s, t). Indeed, this can already be\r
done simply by using the lightlike Ward identities. The proof of this assertion is a simple\r
application of the no-ghost theorem and DDF operators [7]. If k0 is a lightlike vector,\r
p\r
2\r
0 = 2, and p0 · k0 = 1 then the bracket\r
{iζ · ∂Xe−iℓk0X, · } : H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0, n]\r
is equivalent to applying DDF operators ζ · A−ℓ to H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ]. Therefore, the\r
no-ghost theorem implies that\r
{, } : ⊕1≤ℓ≤nH[−ℓk0, 1] ⊗ H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0, n] (6.1)\r
is a surjective map.\r
We would like to proceed as in the examples of section four using the Ward identities\r
to reduce the level-numbers of various states in the amplitude. We use induction on\r
nT =\r
Pni\r
, the sum of the level numbers of the states in an amplitude. Consider the\r
lightlike Ward identities of the form\r
\r
\r
n1 n2 n3 n4\r
n1 − ℓ n2 − ℓ n3 n4\r
n1 − ℓ n2 n3 n4\r
n1 − ℓ n2 n3 n4\r
\r
 (6.2)\r
for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n1. These identities relate the amplitude encoded by the first row to amplitudes\r
with smaller values of nT . Since (6.1) is surjective, we can map an arbitrary amplitude,\r
that is, an amplitude where the level n1 state has an arbitrary polarization, to amplitudes\r
with smaller total level number.\r
22

6.2. N-particle scattering\r
The above argument generalizes easily to N-particle scattering, using the level matrix\r
\r
\r
n1 n2 n3 . . . nN\r
n1 − ℓ n2 − ℓ n3 . . . nN\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
n1 − ℓ n2 n3 . . . nN\r
n1 − ℓ n2 n3 . . . nN\r
\r
\r
(6.3)\r
as long as we can specify the levels and kinematic invariants arbitrarily. From the discussion\r
of section 3.3 we see that this is possible for N ≤ 26 and hence N-particle scattering for\r
arbitrary levels can be expressed in terms of tachyon scattering.\r
We can complete the argument for uniqueness by using the results of section 5, where\r
we showed that the bracket relations determine the N-tachyon amplitude up to a constant\r
cN (see (5.20)).\r
6.3. Summary\r
We have established:\r
Theorem 1: A multilinear function AN : H⊗N → C, N ≤ 26, which satisfies\r
1. Poincar´e invariance\r
2. The bracket relations (3.7).\r
3. The analyticity properties AP1 and AP2\r
is uniquely determined up to an overall constant, cN .\r
Moreover, an easy argument gives:\r
Theorem 2: A set of multilinear functions {AN }N≤26 which satisfy 1,2,3 above as well\r
as AP3 are uniquely specified up to one parameter κ by cN = κ\r
N−2\r
.\r
Theorem 2 follows in the standard way by examining the residue of a tachyon ampli\u0002tude at a tachyon pole. By AP3 this must be a product of tachyon amplitudes. Hence\r
cN1+1cN2+1 = cN1+N2so cN = κ\r
N−2\r
, where κ is the string coupling.\r
Remark: We offer one speculation on how the above results can be generalized to N > 26.\r
In establishing theorem 1 we only used the bracket relations for currents J at levels 0, 1.\r
In order to extend the results to N > 26 it will be necessary to use higher level currents.\r
In the notation of section 3.3 , by fixing the ni, n˜i we are only free to choose momenta\r
to fix independent invariants sij (i 6= j), on a codimension N subvariety I(ni, n˜i) of the\r
variety I(ni) of all invariants sij at fixed ni. Nonetheless, it is possible that the amplitude\r
23

can still be uniquely determined by generalizing the idea of “analytic continuation from\r
the integers” used previously. By varying the ˜ni at fixed ni one can possibly determine\r
the amplitude An1,...nN on “enough” subvarieties I(ni, n˜i) ⊂ I(ni) that, when combined\r
with the axioms AP1,AP2, the amplitude is fixed on the entire variety I(ni).\r
7. Closed Strings\r
The closed string cohomology for ghost number (1, 1) is\r
Hc = H1,1\r
c = ⊕n∈ZZ+\r
Z\r
IR25,1\r
dp H[p, n] ⊗ H¯[p, n] (7.1)\r
where the superscript refers to left and right ghost number and the bar always stands\r
for “right-mover,” and not “complex conjugate.” S-matrix amplitudes are multilinear\r
functions Ac : H⊗n\r
c → C constructed as follows. The operator formalism associates a\r
measure Ω(V1 ⊗ V¯\r
1, . . . , Vn ⊗ V¯n) on the moduli space of the n-punctured Riemann sphere,\r
M0,n. We integrate Ω over M0,n for an appropriate domain of sij and continue analytically\r
from there. There are two ways we may try to extend the above results to closed strings.\r
7.1. Factorization of Amplitudes\r
A beautiful result of Kawai, Lewellen, and Tye [23] states that the closed and open\r
four-particle amplitudes are related by 9\r
Ac(V1 ⊗ V¯\r
1, V2 ⊗ V¯2,V3 ⊗ V¯3, V4 ⊗ V¯4)\r
= − sin(πt)A(V1, V2, V3, V4)A(V¯\r
1, V¯3, V¯2, V¯4)\r
(7.2)\r
At high energy we have\r
Ac(V1 ⊗ V¯\r
1, V2 ⊗ V¯2,V3 ⊗ V¯3, V4 ⊗ V¯4)\r
∼ As.p.(V1, V2, V3, V4)A\r
s.p.(V¯\r
1, V¯2, V¯3, V¯4)\r
(7.3)\r
Similar, but more complicated remarks hold for n-particle scattering. We may combine\r
(7.2) with previous results to relate scattering of massive closed string states to closed\r
string tachyonic scattering.\r
9 We take α\r
′ = 2 for closed string amplitudes.\r
24

7.2. Algebraic structures for closed strings\r
It is possible to extend the definition of the bracket to the closed string, as shown in\r
[16][17]. Composing this bracket with b\r
+\r
0 = b0 + ¯b0 we obtain a map of the physical states\r
to themselves: H1,1\r
c ⊗ H1,1c → H1,1c\r
. This map is essentially a tensor product of open\r
string brackets and does not turn the physical states into a Lie algebra. Also, one cannot\r
justify the analog of (3.7). Thus, the most straightforward generalization of the previous\r
discussion does not work.\r
Instead what one can do is consider Hc to be the “diagonal” subspace of the larger\r
space\r
H˜\r
c = Hopen ⊗ H¯open\r
defined by equality of left and right momenta: p = ¯p. Amplitudes on the larger space H˜\r
c\r
are only defined for n-tuples which are pairwise mutually local. The physical amplitudes\r
are a subset of this expanded set. It is straightforward to write bracket relations for this\r
expanded set of amplitudes. Suppose J ⊗ J¯ has momentum (q, q¯), and suppose further\r
that q +\r
Ppi = 0, q · pi ∈ ZZ, ¯q +Pp¯i = 0, ¯q · p¯i ∈ ZZ. Then\r
X\r
i,¯i\r
(−1)q·p2+···q·pi(−1)q¯·p¯2+···q¯·p¯¯i\r
Ac\r
\r
V1 ⊗ V¯\r
1, . . . , {J, Vi} ⊗ V¯i\r
, . . . ,V¯i ⊗ {J, ¯ V¯¯i}, . . . , Vn ⊗ V¯\r
n\r
\u0001\r
= 0\r
(7.4)\r
Evidently, the previous sections apply to the left- and right- degrees of freedom separately\r
and fully determine the expanded set of amplitudes, hence a fortiori, the physical ones, at\r
least for n ≤ 26.\r
One implication of these remarks is that the α\r
′ → 0 limit of scattering amplitudes of\r
gravitons are in principle completely determined by the bracket relations. This raises the\r
interesting issue of the relation of bracket algebras and algebras of vector fields.\r
8. Conclusions\r
8.1. What we did\r
We have shown that the bracket operation on mutually local BRST classes may be\r
combined with Lorentz invariance and analyticity to write an infinite set of functional\r
relations on string scattering amplitudes. These relations are rather restrictive. The\r
central results of this paper are theorems 1 and 2 of section 6.3 which state that the bracket\r
25

relations together with the analyticity axioms AP1,AP2, AP3 of section 2.3 uniquely\r
determine the genus zero open string S-matrix in terms of a single free parameter, κ, the\r
string coupling constant, at least for N ≤ 26-particle scattering.\r
Some readers will be puzzled by our emphasis on high-energy limits. This limit might\r
seem irrelevant if the bracket relations already determine the amplitude for all energies.\r
The finite-difference relations are not, properly speaking, Ward identities since they relate\r
amplitudes at different energies. Our chief concern has been understanding the symmetries\r
of string theory and how they are realized in different backgrounds. Since high energy\r
limits of the finite-difference relations look more like Ward-identities they deserve special\r
attention.\r
Some readers will object that this paper contains nothing new. After all, the structure\r
constants of the bracket are just the on-shell three point functions. By factorization, a\r
knowledge of all the three-point functions in principle determines the full S-matrix. If one\r
were mainly interested in explicit formulae for amplitudes the factorization approach would\r
be impracticable, whereas our approach could be made quite efficient. The important point\r
is, however, that the present discussion clarifies the fundamental role of the underlying\r
algebraic structure of the bracket.\r
8.2. What we should do\r
There is plenty of room for further work.\r
Clearly the restriction on N ≤ 26 for N-particle scattering is extremely unsatisfactory.\r
It is possible that the result of this paper can be extended to N > 26 by combining the\r
procedure of “analytic continuation from the integers” with bracket relations for states\r
other than lightlike states. Indeed, in arriving at our result we have used only a small\r
subset of the entire set of bracket relations.\r
There are several possible generalizations of the present study. These include:\r
1. String perturbation theory. Unfortunately, it is far from clear how to extend the\r
above results to quantum perturbation theory. The problem is that a chiral BRST class J\r
is not mutually local with respect to all states. That means {J, · } does not commute with\r
an insertion of the identity operator P|IihI| or, more geometrically, contour integrals\r
of J cannot be pulled around handles. This problem disappears for total closed string\r
compactification, but, curiously, such theories have other difficulties with loop amplitudes\r
[6]. For the same reason extension to mixed open-closed string scattering is not trivial.\r
26

Our attitude towards this problem is that in this paper we have managed to understand\r
better the classical symmetries of string theory. It remains to be seen how the symmetries\r
are realized quantum-mechanically. We are pursuing some ideas in this direction.\r
2. Fermionic strings. It should be interesting to generalize these results to superstring\r
amplitudes. We intend to return to this in a future work.\r
3. Other backgrounds. We have restricted attention to the background of 26-\r
dimensional Minkowski space. Bracket relations should exist for amplitudes in any back\u0002ground with an uncompactified Minkowski space component. If the monodromy of the\r
internal parts of vertex operators is abelian one should be able to adjust spacetime mo\u0002menta to obtain mutual locality in some situations. In such situations the technical lemma\r
of section 3.3 shows that one could write bracket relations for N ≤ d -particle scattering\r
where d is the number of uncompactified dimensions. The symmetry algebra of mutu\u0002ally local BRST classes will depend on the background. It is not clear how effective the\r
relations will be in other backgrounds.\r
The bracket relations are very reminiscent of the “W∞ Ward identities” which have\r
been used to obtain amplitudes for string scattering in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime [13]\r
[24–26]. These techniques made essential use of the existence of a nontrivial ghost number\r
zero cohomology, something which is absent in the critical bosonic string. We hope that\r
the bracket relations will play a role in general backgrounds analogous to the “W∞ Ward\r
identities” of 1 + 1 dimensional string theory.\r
Finally, finite difference relations for correlation functions are known to arise in certain\r
exactly solvable quantum field theories as well as in studies of q-deformed affine algebras.\r
It would be very interesting to discover an underlying quantum group symmetry in the\r
critical bosonic string S-matrix.\r
8.3. What are we doing?\r
Beyond these questions of generalization there is the much larger question of exactly\r
what role the bracket should play in the formulation of string theory.\r
We believe that the bracket relations are a stringy expression of spontaneous symmetry\r
breaking. On physical grounds one expects that symmetries which connect scattering of\r
states at different mass levels must be spontaneously broken. We will say that a current\r
J(z) (or, more generally, a ghost number 1 BRST class) is “broken” if it is not mutually\r
local with respect to some on-shell state. In the open string the on-shell condition is simply\r
Qψ = 0 so the only unbroken currents are ∂Xµ. In the closed string statespace - viewed\r
27

as a subspace of Hopen ⊗ H¯\r
open- the on-shell condition requires furthermore that pL = pR.\r
According to this terminology all holomorphic BRST classes are off-shell and broken with\r
the exception of c∂Xµ and its conjugate. Nevertheless, through the bracket relations these\r
holomorphic classes constrain the couplings of on-shell particles.\r
From the above point of view, the uncompactified string contains infinitely many\r
broken symmetry algebras. These are the sets L = {Vi} of mutually local BRST invariant\r
states in Hopen which are closed under the bracket. We have seen in section 3.1 that such\r
sets L can be given the structure of a vectorially-graded Lie algebra. We can further justify\r
the name “broken symmetry algebra” for such sets L by noting that L can also be given\r
a Lie algebra structure, and that this Lie algebra is an algebra of unbroken symmetries\r
of some closed string toroidal compactification. The reason for this is that, if {pi} is the\r
set of momenta associated to {Vi} then Γ = hpii is an even integral lattice. (Γ may be\r
Euclidean or Lorentzian.) The lattice is even since p\r
2\r
i = 2 − 2ni and integral by mutual\r
locality. By the Frenkel-Kac construction [27] [28], we can introduce cocycle operators to\r
turn the vectorially-graded bracket algebra of the {Vi} into a true Lie algebra structure on\r
LΓ = ⊕n≥0,p∈ΓH[p, n] .\r
To see that this is the unbroken symmetry of a toroidal compactification recall that\r
(Γ; 0) ⊕ (0; Γ) ֒→{(pL; pR)|pL, pR ∈ Γ\r
∗\r
, pL − pR ∈ Γ}\r
∼= IID,D\r
and the unbroken symmetry associated with this background is LΓ ⊕ LΓ.\r
It is further natural to consider maximal sets of mutually local BRST classes {Vi}. The\r
associated lattices have rank 26 and are necessarily hyperbolic. The associated Lie algebras\r
are unbroken symmetries of totally compactified backgrounds. Among these backgrounds\r
there is a distinguished compactification, namely, compactification on the torus defined\r
by Γ∗ = II25,1in the open case or on the Narain compactification for Γ∗ = (II25,1; 0) ⊕\r
(0; II25,1) in the closed case. Here II25,1is the unique even self-dual lattice in IR25,1.\r
The corresponding algebra L∗ = LΓ∗ has been dubbed the “fake Monster Lie algebra” by\r
Borcherds [29] [30].\r
Based on the analogy with Euclidean compactifications, which duly reproduces the\r
Higgs mechanism in the α\r
′ → 0 limit [7], we may say that the uncompactified string is\r
a spontaneously broken gauge theory with the gauge algebra L∗ (in the open case) and\r
L∗ ⊕ L∗ (in the closed case) broken down to IR26 and IR26 ⊕ IR26 respectively.\r
28

At high energies the bracket relations become Ward identities. This should be un\u0002derstood as some kind of stringy high-energy symmetry restoration which replaces the\r
analogous notion in spontaneously broken gauge theory. (As shown in appendix B, the\r
standard field-theoretic approach does not generalize straightforwardly.) In this sense the\r
above hyperbolic Lie algebras of toroidal compactification “explain” the linear relations\r
on high energy amplitudes discussed in [1].\r
Remark: The uniqueness of S is a generalization of Proposition 14 of [6], with the fake\r
Monster Lie algebra replaced by the “vectorially-graded Lie algebroid of physical states.” It\r
is interesting to note that the structure constants of these two algebraic objects are closely\r
related. The structure constants of appendix A are, essentially, analytic continuations of\r
the structure constants of L∗. One could say that the bosonic string S-matrix is made out\r
of the structure constants of L∗.\r
8.4. What we dream of doing\r
It is clear from a study of unbroken symmetries in toroidal compactification that the\r
Lie algebras L∗, L∗ ⊕ L∗, while distinguished, are not the full story. As explained in [6]\r
L∗ ⊕ L∗ is not a universal symmetry for closed string toroidal compactification. We hope\r
that there is some kind of “universal” algebraic structure in string theory which will replace\r
compact Lie algebras in the complete formulation of string theory as a generalization of\r
gauge theory.\r
In nonabelian gauge theories like the standard model the on-shell asymptotic states\r
form representations of the symmetry group. Since the representations do not just involve\r
the adjoint there is, in general, no algebraic structure on the space of on-shell states. String\r
theories are a very interesting class of theories in which the on-shell states themselves form\r
an algebra. String theory might some day be regarded as the theory of symmetry in\r
its purest form: a single symmetry principle fixes entirely the particle content and the\r
interactions.\r
Note added: The earlier version of this paper erroneously claimed that the lemma of\r
section 3.3 applied to N-particle scattering for all N, not just N ≤ 26, and hence that\r
bracket relations fixed all N-particle amplitudes. I thank E. Witten for pointing out this\r
error. I also thank H. Verlinde for insisting on the point when I didn’t listen.\r

Appendix B. High energy symmetries and spontaneous symmetry breaking\r
In [6] we proposed that the infinite dimensional symmetries arising upon time\u0002compactification - of which L∗ ⊕ L∗ is a spectacular example - are the high-energy sym\u0002metries of [1]. The idea was that Ward identities derived in a symmetric compactification\r
could be “parallel transported” to the decompactified background. The decompactifica\u0002tion forces momenta to infinity, hence the connection with high energy scattering. This\r
proposal was based on a field theoretic intuition: in field theory the effects of spontaneous\r
symmetry breaking disappear at high energies. It turns out that this intuition is not very\r
good in string theory. Closed string scattering at high energy is sensitive to the breaking\r
of toroidal symmetries. In this appendix we demonstrate that surprising fact with a few\r
simple examples.\r
B.1. Recovery of Ward Identities in Field Theory\r
We consider enhanced symmetries and symmetry breaking in the framework of toroidal\r
compactification. (We only consider compactification of spacelike dimensions here.) Sup\u0002pose we have an unbroken symmetry current Jq = e\r

vector (q; 0) with q\r
2 = 2. Consider a theory at Γ′ = g(λ)·Γ where g(λ) is a one-parameter\r
family of O(d, d) rotations taking (q; 0) to (qL; qR) with qR 6= 0. The symmetry associated\r

Consider the scattering amplitudes A(V1, . . . Vn) for (massless and massive) gauge\r
bosons. The field-theory limit is obtained by letting q\r
2\r
R, pi\r
· pj → 0 and expanding in these\r
variables. The amplitudes have an expansion A =\r
Pǫ\r
nA(n)\r
in powers of ǫ = 1/mpl, where\r
each A(n)is a rational function of its arguments.\r
If we have a Ward identity in the unbroken phase PA(V1, . . . δVi, . . . Vm) = 0 then we\r
may ask what happens to the corresponding amplitudes in the broken phase. The precise\r
definition of “corresponding amplitudes” requires a transport operator T\r
λ on the BRST\r

cohomology. We will simply rotate momenta by O(d, d) transformations: this will suffice\r
for our examples. 10 For each n we have\r

δVi, . . . T λVm) = 0 (B.1)\r
and since A(n) are rational functions of pi· pj and of the symmetry-breaking masses q\r
2\r
R(λ)\r
we conclude that the sum of the terms is proportional to the symmetry breaking masses.\r
Therefore, for dimensional reasons, at each order in the expansion in 1/mpl the sum of\r
the terms grows more slowly in energy than the individual terms. In particular, for the\r
leading terms ∼ mn\r
pl where n is a nonnegative power, the sum of the terms vanishes. This\r
is the recovery of the Ward identity at high energy.\r
Example. To be explicit, consider a circular compactification of a single dimension\r
Y . Let R = e\r
λ\r
. At λ = 0 we have an unbroken SU(2) × SU(2) gauge theory which is\r
broken to U(1) × U(1) for λ > 0. Introduce the notation:\r
e(j, ¯j, R) ≡ e\r

Focus on a single factor SU(2) → U(1). In the broken phase we have massive gauge\r
bosons, call them W±(ǫ), with corresponding vertex operators:\r
W±(ǫ, p) = e(±1, 0, R)ǫ · ∂Xe ¯ ip·X (B.3)\r
where X, p refer to uncompactified dimensions. (B.3) are on shell for p · ǫ = 0, p2 +\r
2 sinh2λ = 0. There are also massless gauge bosons for the unbroken U(1) generators, call\r
them Z(ǫ) described by vertex operators:\r
Z(ǫ, p) = cosh λ∂Y ǫ · ∂Xe ¯ ip·X (B.4)\r
which are on-shell for p · ǫ = 0, p2 = 0. (The factor of cosh λ in (B.4) is motivated by the\r
transport in [6]. It can be dropped without changing our conclusions.)\r
At the su(2) point λ = 0 we have the su(2) Ward identity:\r

to the plane of scattering and that ǫ1 · ǫ3ǫ2 · ǫ4 = ǫ1 · ǫ4ǫ2 · ǫ3 = 0, ǫ1 · ǫ2ǫ3 · ǫ4 = 1. In the\r

than each of the separate amplitudes, and, in particular, the leading term of order O(m0\r

While the sum of the three terms in (B.7) vanishes at λ = 0 this is not the case for\r
any λ 6= 0: the sum is not any smaller in magnitude than any of the three terms in the\r
sum.\r
Example 2:\r
At the SU(2) point the vertex operators φ\r
±± = e(±\r

identity (again for J\r

A(φ\r
+−, φ−+, φ+−, φ−+) + A(φ−−, φ++, φ+−, φ−+) + A(φ−−, φ−+, φ+−, φ++) = 0 (B.8)\r
In the broken phase λ > 0 and in the high energy limit the sum of the three terms becomes:\r
\u0014\r
1\r
|z0|R2\r
|z0 − 1|\r
R\r

(B.9)\r
Again we see that the sum of terms is no smaller than the individual terms.\r
B.3. Physical interpretation\r
We believe that the failure to recover the Ward identities in the high energy limit is\r
related to the notorious delocalization of strings at ultrahigh energies [31]. This delocaliza\u0002tion makes the string amplitudes once again sensitive to relatively long-distance physics,\r
like the specific nature of the compactification scheme.\r

String theory is a generalization of gauge theory. Historically, understanding the\r
importance of general covariance and local isotopic-spin invariance were crucial steps in the\r
formulation of general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. One might therefore suspect that\r
a complete formulation of string theory will be predicated upon a deeper understanding\r
of the symmetries in the theory.\r
In [1] D. Gross proposed that one useful tool for discovering fundamental string sym\u0002metries is the analysis of the high energy behavior of string scattering amplitudes. In field\r
theories of spontaneously broken gauge invariance this technique works very well. Using\r
the saddle-point analysis of [2] Gross derived an infinite set of linear relations between\r
bosonic string 4-particle S-matrix amplitudes. Usually linear relations between scattering\r
amplitudes are derived from an underlying symmetry, and it was suggested in [1] that such\r
a symmetry must explain these linear relations. Some work has subsequently been done\r
with a view towards understanding this mysterious symmetry in [3] [4] [5].\r
In [6] it was suggested that the infinite dimensional hyperbolic symmetries which arise\r
upon toroidal compactification of time might be the source of the high energy symmetries\r
of string theory. The original program of [6] is probably misguided, for reasons explained\r
in appendix B below. Nevertheless, as we show in the present paper, the basic idea that\r
generalized Kac-Moody algebras are high-energy symmetries of string theory is correct. In\r
fact, more is true. We can replace high energy Ward identities, which relate amplitudes\r
at the same values of s, t by finite difference relations for the exact amplitudes. These\r
finite difference relations put strong constraints on the genus zero string S-matrix. We\r
will show that they determine scattering amplitudes at all mass levels in terms of tachyon\r
scattering. Moreover, when supplemented with some mild analyticity requirements (e.g.\r
Regge-like behavior at s → ∞) the finite difference relations even determine the tachyon\r
amplitude itself. A technical point discussed in section 3.3 limits our discussion to N\u0002particle scattering for N ≤ 26.\r
In essence the answer to the problem posed in [1] is very simple: the underlying\r
symmetries are the bracket algebras defined by on-shell mutually local BRST invariant\r
chiral vertex operators."""

of the yi and of the relativistic invariants sij ≡ pi· pj . It follows from the o.p.e. that there\r
is a domain where Re(sij) is sufficiently large and positive, or negative, (depending on ij)\r
so that the integral is absolutely convergent and defines a holomorphic function of the sij .\r
The analytic continuation from this domain defines an amplitude which is a meromorphic\r
function of the sij .\r
It will be important to specify clearly the independent relativistic invariants that A\r
depends upon. These invariants are formed out of momenta pi and polarization tensors\r
ζi. Relativistic invariants formed from the pi alone parametrize the different orbits of\r
SO(1, d − 1) on the space of n − 1 independent momenta. Taking into consideration the\r

For n ≤ d a set of algebraically independent invariants can be chosen to be an ap\u0002propriate collection of the sij. For example, we may choose sij for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤\r
n − 1. (We make a different choice below.) For n ≥ d + 1 the story is more com\u0002plicated. By classical invariant theory [9] the ring of polynomial invariants is gener\u0002ated by the sij and by [p\r

We separate the independent relativistic invariants into three types:\r

Two years ago it was shown that the BRST cohomology of 2D string theory has\r
a rich algebraic structure related to BV quantization [12] [13] [14]. Subsequently, Lian\r
and Zuckerman studied the algebraic structures of the BRST cohomology based on an\r
arbitrary chiral algebra (=vertex operator algebra [15]) in [16] [17]. As shown by Lian and\r
Zuckerman, there is an operation {·, ·} : Hg1 × Hg2 → Hg1+g2−1 which they called the\r
“Gerstenhaber bracket.” The bracket is very fundamental: it exists for arbitrary bosonic\r
string cohomology and plays a role related to the BV anti-bracket for the on-shell BV\r
structure of string theory. In the present case we may identify ghost number 1 classes with\r
chiral physical state operators and the bracket is simply the standard “commutator” of\r
dimension one currents:\r
J ⊗ V → {J, V }(z) ≡\r
I\r

In general, the ghost number one cohomology based on a chiral algebra is a Lie algebra.\r
In our case H in (2.1) is not based on a chiral algebra because the fields have mon\u0002odromy when considered as chiral vertex operators. Nevertheless, when J, V are mutually\r
local (3.1) still makes sense. 5In particular, given two momenta p, q with q\r
2 = 2 − 2n1,\r
p\r
2 = 2 − 2n2, (p + q)2 = 2 − 2n3. we have a map:\r
{·, ·} : H[q, n1] ⊗ H[p, n2] → H[p + q, n3]\r
We may extend the bracket to all of H:\r
{·, ·} : H ⊗ H → H\r
by defining it to be zero on pairs not mutually local. 6\r
The bracket has the two properties:\r
B1. If p1, p2 are the momenta of V1, V2 then:\r
{V1, V2} = −(−1)p1·p2 {V2, V1}\r
5\r
In this paper “mutually local” means the o.p.e. has only integral powers of z − w. Equiva\u0002lently, the monodromy is trivial (although the braiding matrix could be (−1)).\r

states. That is, it is like multiplication in a groupoid, or composition of morphisms in a category."""

Example one of the previous section has already produced one identity on the tachyon\r
scattering amplitude A(s, t). The relation (4.2) by itself is not sufficiently strong to de\u0002termine the function A. However, we can combine it with (4.6) using the decoupling of\r
BRST trivial states. Decoupling of the longitudinal photon implies that A0100(s, t|s, t) = 0.\r
Combining this with (4.6) we get\r
sA(s − 1, t) = tA(s, t − 1) (5.1)\r

Moreover, by AP1 it is an entire function. By AP2, the entire function A˜ is of expo\u0002nential type [20]. A periodic entire function of exponential type must be a trigonometric\r

A˜(s, t) = X\r

5.2. n-particle scattering, n ≤ 26\r
The above procedure can be extended to higher point functions, although the amount\r
of work involved goes up rapidly with n. We take the independent kinematic variables to\r

which holds ∀a, b, c such that 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ n−1 where all other variables in the ellipsis\r
are held fixed. We call these “triangle relations” since they relate a triangle of variables in\r
(5.5).\r
Using the triangle relations one easily reduces an arbitrary tachyon amplitude for\r
sij ∈ ZZ+, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n − 2 to the case where:\r

Next, one may write lightlike relations connecting A0···010···0 to tachyon scattering.\r
As above, one can put A0···010···0 to zero by evaluating at special polarization invariants\r
corresponding to longitudinal photons. In this way we obtain a set of n − 1 relations for\r

As we will show below, these equations are sufficient to determine the functional\r
dependence of F for sij ∈ ZZ, up to a finite set of arbitrary constants. The remaining\r
undetermined constants can be fixed (up to one overall scale) by use of the axiom AP1.\r
We illustrate this by giving the general solution to the functional equations (5.7)(5.8)(5.9)\r
for the case of the 5-particle function. We then give the general argument.\r

The equations must be evaluated in the quadrant x = −2 − a, y = −2 − b, a, b ≥ 0,\r
otherwise the amplitude might have poles. The general solution to (5.10) in this quadrant\r
is easily found to be\r

Equation (5.13) is derived for integral values of sij . In order to “continue” to all values\r
of sij we must combine results on entire functions with the analyticity property AP2 of\r
section 2.3, as in the previous section. This is straightforward when s13 = 0. In the\r
general case we must use a Mellin-Barnes representation for 3F2 to establish appropriate\r
asymptotics.\r
The formula (5.13) can actually be derived directly from the integral representation\r
(2.8) using formulae in, e.g., [21]. Similar formulae have appeared in a different context in\r
[22].\r
5.4. 6 ≤ n ≤ 26\r
The above discussion generalizes to n- particle scattering for 6 ≤ n ≤ 26. The\r
analyticity property AP1 combined with the functional equation (5.9) is sufficiently strong\r
to obtain the general formula.\r
We now prove this. To begin we use (5.9) with s2 = s3 = · · · = 0:\r
s1F(s1 − 1,~0) = (n − 3 + s1)F(s1,~0) (5.14)\r
which implies\r
F(s1,~0) = c\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + n − 3) (5.15)\r
where c is a constant. Now given F(s1,~0) we can again use (5.9) to derive\r
F(s1, 1,~0) = c1s1 + c2\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + n − 2) (5.16)\r
where c1, c2 are constants. We can carry on in this way and easily establish by induction\r
that if s2, s3, . . . are nonnegative integers then\r
F(s1, s2, . . . sn−3) = P\r
s2,...sn−3 (s1)\r
(s1 + 1)· · ·(s1 + s2 + · · · + sn−3 + n − 3) (5.17)\r
20

where P\r
s2,...sn−3 (s1) is a polynomial of degree s2 + · · · + sn−3.\r
Now, as with the 5pt function we can fix the coefficients of the polynomial by invoking\r
AP1. By AP1 the function F(~s) can only have poles when\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}\r
s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}\r
s1,n−1 + s2,n−1 + s3,n−1 ∈ {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, . . .}\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
s1,n−1 + · · · sn−3,n−1 ∈ {−(n − 3), −(n − 4), . . .}\r
(5.18)\r
Therefore, the polynomial in the numerator of (5.17) must cancel the poles:\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 1, . . . , −2}\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − 3, . . . , −s2 − s3 − 2}\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
.\r
s1,n−1 ∈ {−s2 − · · · − sn−4 − (n − 3), . . . , −s2 − · · · − sn−3 − (n − 4)}\r
(5.19)\r
This fixes all the constants in P up to an overall scale and we obtain the result\r
F(~s) = cn\r
nY−3\r
j=1\r
−1\r
j +\r
Pj\r
ℓ=1 sℓ,n−1\r
(5.20)\r
which can also be checked directly from the integral representation (2.8).\r
One can proceed from here to evaluate the general tachyon amplitude using the tri\u0002angle relations and AP2. The result after “putting back” s12, s23, . . . sn−3,n−2 is still a\r
product of gamma functions. The general result is a multiple hypergeometric function of\r
1\r
2\r
(n − 3)(n − 4) arguments. For example, the six-point function turns out to be:\r
X\r
j1,j2,j3≥0\r

j1!j2!j3!\r

Γ(4 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3)\r
Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2 + j3)\r
Γ(1 + s12)Γ(1 + s23)Γ(1 + s34)\r
Γ(5 − s23 − s34 − s35 − s45 + j1 + j2)\r
(5.21)\r
Multiple hypergeometric functions have been studied to some extent in the literature, see,\r
e.g., [21]. In order to apply AP2 we must give a Mellin-Barnes representation to series\r
like (5.21) to establish the appropriate asymptotics in sij . We have not carried out this\r
procedure in complete detail, but fully expect that it can be done.\r

We now argue that the solution to the bracket relations is essentially unique.\r
6.1. 4-particle S-matrix\r
We begin by showing that the identities (3.4) completely fix the 4-particle S-matrix\r
for all particles in terms of the level zero S-matrix A(s, t). Indeed, this can already be\r
done simply by using the lightlike Ward identities. The proof of this assertion is a simple\r
application of the no-ghost theorem and DDF operators [7]. If k0 is a lightlike vector,\r
p\r
2\r
0 = 2, and p0 · k0 = 1 then the bracket\r
{iζ · ∂Xe−iℓk0X, · } : H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0, n]\r
is equivalent to applying DDF operators ζ · A−ℓ to H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ]. Therefore, the\r
no-ghost theorem implies that\r
{, } : ⊕1≤ℓ≤nH[−ℓk0, 1] ⊗ H[p0 − (n − ℓ)k0, n − ℓ] → H[p0 − nk0, n] (6.1)\r
is a surjective map.\r
We would like to proceed as in the examples of section four using the Ward identities\r
to reduce the level-numbers of various states in the amplitude. We use induction on\r

n1 − ℓ n2 n3 n4\r

\r
 (6.2)\r
for 1 ≤ ℓ ≤ n1. These identities relate the amplitude encoded by the first row to amplitudes\r
with smaller values of nT . Since (6.1) is surjective, we can map an arbitrary amplitude,\r
that is, an amplitude where the level n1 state has an arbitrary polarization, to amplitudes\r

In order to extend the results to N > 26 it will be necessary to use higher level currents.\r
In the notation of section 3.3 , by fixing the ni, n˜i we are only free to choose momenta\r
to fix independent invariants sij (i 6= j), on a codimension N subvariety I(ni, n˜i) of the\r
variety I(ni) of all invariants sij at fixed ni. Nonetheless, it is possible that the amplitude\r
23

can still be uniquely determined by generalizing the idea of “analytic continuation from\r
the integers” used previously. By varying the ˜ni at fixed ni one can possibly determine\r
the amplitude An1,...nN on “enough” subvarieties I(ni, n˜i) ⊂ I(ni) that, when combined\r
with the axioms AP1,AP2, the amplitude is fixed on the entire variety I(ni)."""

We have shown that the bracket operation on mutually local BRST classes may be\r
combined with Lorentz invariance and analyticity to write an infinite set of functional\r
relations on string scattering amplitudes. These relations are rather restrictive. The\r
central results of this paper are theorems 1 and 2 of section 6.3 which state that the bracket\r
25

relations together with the analyticity axioms AP1,AP2, AP3 of section 2.3 uniquely\r
determine the genus zero open string S-matrix in terms of a single free parameter, κ, the\r
string coupling constant, at least for N ≤ 26-particle scattering.\r
Some readers will be puzzled by our emphasis on high-energy limits. This limit might\r
seem irrelevant if the bracket relations already determine the amplitude for all energies.\r
The finite-difference relations are not, properly speaking, Ward identities since they relate\r
amplitudes at different energies. Our chief concern has been understanding the symmetries\r
of string theory and how they are realized in different backgrounds. Since high energy\r
limits of the finite-difference relations look more like Ward-identities they deserve special\r
attention.\r
Some readers will object that this paper contains nothing new. After all, the structure\r
constants of the bracket are just the on-shell three point functions. By factorization, a\r
knowledge of all the three-point functions in principle determines the full S-matrix. If one\r
were mainly interested in explicit formulae for amplitudes the factorization approach would\r
be impracticable, whereas our approach could be made quite efficient. The important point\r
is, however, that the present discussion clarifies the fundamental role of the underlying\r
algebraic structure of the bracket."""

There is plenty of room for further work.\r
Clearly the restriction on N ≤ 26 for N-particle scattering is extremely unsatisfactory.\r
It is possible that the result of this paper can be extended to N > 26 by combining the\r
procedure of “analytic continuation from the integers” with bracket relations for states\r
other than lightlike states. Indeed, in arriving at our result we have used only a small\r
subset of the entire set of bracket relations.\r
There are several possible generalizations of the present study. These include:\r
1. String perturbation theory. Unfortunately, it is far from clear how to extend the\r
above results to quantum perturbation theory. The problem is that a chiral BRST class J\r
is not mutually local with respect to all states. That means {J, · } does not commute with\r
an insertion of the identity operator P|IihI| or, more geometrically, contour integrals\r
of J cannot be pulled around handles. This problem disappears for total closed string\r
compactification, but, curiously, such theories have other difficulties with loop amplitudes\r
[6]. For the same reason extension to mixed open-closed string scattering is not trivial.\r
26

Our attitude towards this problem is that in this paper we have managed to understand\r
better the classical symmetries of string theory. It remains to be seen how the symmetries\r
are realized quantum-mechanically. We are pursuing some ideas in this direction.\r
2. Fermionic strings. It should be interesting to generalize these results to superstring\r

internal parts of vertex operators is abelian one should be able to adjust spacetime mo\u0002menta to obtain mutual locality in some situations. In such situations the technical lemma\r
of section 3.3 shows that one could write bracket relations for N ≤ d -particle scattering\r
where d is the number of uncompactified dimensions. The symmetry algebra of mutu\u0002ally local BRST classes will depend on the background. It is not clear how effective the\r
relations will be in other backgrounds.\r
The bracket relations are very reminiscent of the “W∞ Ward identities” which have\r
been used to obtain amplitudes for string scattering in 1 + 1 dimensional spacetime [13]\r
[24–26]. These techniques made essential use of the existence of a nontrivial ghost number\r
zero cohomology, something which is absent in the critical bosonic string. We hope that\r
the bracket relations will play a role in general backgrounds analogous to the “W∞ Ward\r

Beyond these questions of generalization there is the much larger question of exactly\r
what role the bracket should play in the formulation of string theory.\r
We believe that the bracket relations are a stringy expression of spontaneous symmetry\r
breaking. On physical grounds one expects that symmetries which connect scattering of\r
states at different mass levels must be spontaneously broken. We will say that a current\r
J(z) (or, more generally, a ghost number 1 BRST class) is “broken” if it is not mutually\r
local with respect to some on-shell state. In the open string the on-shell condition is simply\r
Qψ = 0 so the only unbroken currents are ∂Xµ. In the closed string statespace - viewed\r
27

as a subspace of Hopen ⊗ H¯\r
open- the on-shell condition requires furthermore that pL = pR.\r
According to this terminology all holomorphic BRST classes are off-shell and broken with\r
the exception of c∂Xµ and its conjugate. Nevertheless, through the bracket relations these\r
holomorphic classes constrain the couplings of on-shell particles.\r
From the above point of view, the uncompactified string contains infinitely many\r
broken symmetry algebras. These are the sets L = {Vi} of mutually local BRST invariant\r
states in Hopen which are closed under the bracket. We have seen in section 3.1 that such\r
sets L can be given the structure of a vectorially-graded Lie algebra. We can further justify\r
the name “broken symmetry algebra” for such sets L by noting that L can also be given\r
a Lie algebra structure, and that this Lie algebra is an algebra of unbroken symmetries\r
of some closed string toroidal compactification. The reason for this is that, if {pi} is the\r
set of momenta associated to {Vi} then Γ = hpii is an even integral lattice. (Γ may be\r
Euclidean or Lorentzian.) The lattice is even since p\r
2\r
i = 2 − 2ni and integral by mutual\r
locality. By the Frenkel-Kac construction [27] [28], we can introduce cocycle operators to\r
turn the vectorially-graded bracket algebra of the {Vi} into a true Lie algebra structure on\r
LΓ = ⊕n≥0,p∈ΓH[p, n] .\r
To see that this is the unbroken symmetry of a toroidal compactification recall that\r
(Γ; 0) ⊕ (0; Γ) ֒→{(pL; pR)|pL, pR ∈ Γ\r
∗\r
, pL − pR ∈ Γ}\r
∼= IID,D\r
and the unbroken symmetry associated with this background is LΓ ⊕ LΓ.\r
It is further natural to consider maximal sets of mutually local BRST classes {Vi}. The\r
associated lattices have rank 26 and are necessarily hyperbolic. The associated Lie algebras\r
are unbroken symmetries of totally compactified backgrounds. Among these backgrounds\r
there is a distinguished compactification, namely, compactification on the torus defined\r
by Γ∗ = II25,1in the open case or on the Narain compactification for Γ∗ = (II25,1; 0) ⊕\r
(0; II25,1) in the closed case. Here II25,1is the unique even self-dual lattice in IR25,1.\r
The corresponding algebra L∗ = LΓ∗ has been dubbed the “fake Monster Lie algebra” by\r
Borcherds [29] [30].\r
Based on the analogy with Euclidean compactifications, which duly reproduces the\r
Higgs mechanism in the α\r
′ → 0 limit [7], we may say that the uncompactified string is\r
a spontaneously broken gauge theory with the gauge algebra L∗ (in the open case) and\r
L∗ ⊕ L∗ (in the closed case) broken down to IR26 and IR26 ⊕ IR26 respectively.\r
28

At high energies the bracket relations become Ward identities. This should be un\u0002derstood as some kind of stringy high-energy symmetry restoration which replaces the\r
analogous notion in spontaneously broken gauge theory. (As shown in appendix B, the\r
standard field-theoretic approach does not generalize straightforwardly.) In this sense the\r
above hyperbolic Lie algebras of toroidal compactification “explain” the linear relations\r
on high energy amplitudes discussed in [1].\r
Remark: The uniqueness of S is a generalization of Proposition 14 of [6], with the fake\r
Monster Lie algebra replaced by the “vectorially-graded Lie algebroid of physical states.” It\r
is interesting to note that the structure constants of these two algebraic objects are closely\r
related. The structure constants of appendix A are, essentially, analytic continuations of\r
the structure constants of L∗. One could say that the bosonic string S-matrix is made out\r
of the structure constants of L∗."""

It is clear from a study of unbroken symmetries in toroidal compactification that the\r
Lie algebras L∗, L∗ ⊕ L∗, while distinguished, are not the full story. As explained in [6]\r
L∗ ⊕ L∗ is not a universal symmetry for closed string toroidal compactification. We hope\r
that there is some kind of “universal” algebraic structure in string theory which will replace\r
compact Lie algebras in the complete formulation of string theory as a generalization of\r
gauge theory.\r
In nonabelian gauge theories like the standard model the on-shell asymptotic states\r
form representations of the symmetry group. Since the representations do not just involve\r
the adjoint there is, in general, no algebraic structure on the space of on-shell states. String\r
theories are a very interesting class of theories in which the on-shell states themselves form\r

Appendix B. High energy symmetries and spontaneous symmetry breaking\r
In [6] we proposed that the infinite dimensional symmetries arising upon time\u0002compactification - of which L∗ ⊕ L∗ is a spectacular example - are the high-energy sym\u0002metries of [1]. The idea was that Ward identities derived in a symmetric compactification\r
could be “parallel transported” to the decompactified background. The decompactifica\u0002tion forces momenta to infinity, hence the connection with high energy scattering. This\r
proposal was based on a field theoretic intuition: in field theory the effects of spontaneous\r
symmetry breaking disappear at high energies. It turns out that this intuition is not very\r
good in string theory. Closed string scattering at high energy is sensitive to the breaking\r
of toroidal symmetries. In this appendix we demonstrate that surprising fact with a few\r
simple examples.\r

where U is defined in (3.10).\r
While the sum of the three terms in (B.7) vanishes at λ = 0 this is not the case for\r
any λ 6= 0: the sum is not any smaller in magnitude than any of the three terms in the\r
sum.\r

ip·X describe a\r
scalar field multiplet in the (2, 2) of SU(2)×SU(2). At the SU(2) point we have the Ward\r
identity (again for J\r
+):\r
A(φ\r
+−, φ−+, φ+−, φ−+) + A(φ−−, φ++, φ+−, φ−+) + A(φ−−, φ−+, φ+−, φ++) = 0 (B.8)\r
In the broken phase λ > 0 and in the high energy limit the sum of the three terms becomes:\r

(B.9)\r
Again we see that the sum of terms is no smaller than the individual terms.\r
B.3. Physical interpretation\r
We believe that the failure to recover the Ward identities in the high energy limit is\r
related to the notorious delocalization of strings at ultrahigh energies [31]. This delocaliza\u0002tion makes the string amplitudes once again sensitive to relatively long-distance physics,\r
like the specific nature of the compactification scheme."""
