ABSTRACT\r
I suggest in this letter a new strategy to attack the problem of the reality condi\u0002tions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum general relativity. By writing\r
a modified Hamiltonian constraint in the usual SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space I show\r
that it is possible to describe space-times with Lorentzian signature without the in\u0002troduction of complex variables. All the features of the Ashtekar formalism related to\r
the geometrical nature of the new variables are retained; in particular, it is still pos\u0002sible, in principle, to use the loop variables approach in the passage to the quantum\r
theory. The key issue in the new formulation is how to deal with the more compli\u0002cated Hamiltonian constraint that must be used in order to avoid the introduction of\r
complex fields.

The purpose of this letter is to suggest a new strategy to deal with the problem\r
of the reality conditions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum gravity.\r
At the present moment there is some consensus about the reasons behind the success\r
of the Ashtekar variables program [1]. One of them is the geometrical nature of the\r
new variables. In particular, the fact that the configuration variable is a connection\r
is specially interesting because this allows us to use loop variables both at the clas\u0002sical and quantum level [2]. Another advantage of the formalism is the simplicity of\r
the constraints –specially the Hamiltonian constraint– that has been very helpful in\r
finding solutions to all of them. There are, however, some difficulties in the formalism\r
that must be solved and are not present in the traditional ADM scheme [3]. The most\r
conspicuous one is the fact that complex variables must be used in order to describe\r
Lorentzian signature space-times. This is often put in relation with the fact that the\r
definition of self-duality in these space-times demands the introduction of imaginary\r
coefficients. The now accepted way to deal with this issue is the introduction of real\u0002ity conditions. They impose some consistency requirements on the scalar product in\r
the Hilbert space of physical states. In fact, the hope is that this scalar product can\r
be selected by the reality conditions. There are, however some difficulties with this\r
approach too. Specifically it is very difficult to implement the reality conditions in\r
the loop variables scheme. Only recently some positive results in this direction have\r
been reported [6]. The main point of this letter is to consider the geometrical nature\r
of the Ashtekar variables as the most important asset of the formalism. With this\r
idea in mind, it is easy to see that the introduction of complex variables is necessary\r
only if one wants to have an specially simple form for the Hamiltonian constraint. If\r
we accept to live with a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint in the Ashtekar\r
phase space we can use real variables.\r
An interesting consequence of this, as emphasized by Rovelli and Smolin, is that\r
all the results obtained within the loop variables approach (existence of volume and\r
1

area observables, weave states and so on [4], [5]) whose derivation is independent\r
of the particular form of the scalar constraint scalar can be maintained even for\r
Lorentzian signature space-times because it is possible to describe Lorentzian gravity\r
with real fields in the Ashtekar phase space. More specifically, the issue is not the\r
implementation of the reality conditions (at least at the kinematical) but rather the\r
construction of a scalar product, normalizability of the quantum physical states and\r
so on. The proposal presented in this letter does not address this problems. It must\r
also be said that the construction of area and volume observables referred to above\r
must still be put in a completely sound and rigorous mathematical basis that may very\r
well be provided by the approach presented in [6] to incorporate the reality conditions\r
in the loop variables approach by using a generalization of th e Bargmann-Siegel\r
transform to spaces of connections. This letter has nothing to add with respect to\r
this. In the following, tangent space indices and SO(3) indices will be represented by\r
lowercase Latin letters from the beginning and the middle of the alphabet respectively.\r
The 3-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor density and its inverse will be denoted1 by\r
η˜\r
abc and\r
˜\r
ηabc and the internal SO(3) Levi-Civita tensor by ǫijk. The variables in\r
the SO(3)-ADM phase space (ADM formalism with internal SO(3) symmetry as\r
discussed in [7]) are a densitized triad E˜a\r
i\r
(with determinant denoted by E\r
˜˜) and its\r
canonically conjugate object Ki\r
a\r
(closely related to the extrinsic curvature). The\r
(densitized) three dimensional metric built from the triad will be denoted ˜q˜\r
ab ≡\r
E˜a\r
i E˜bi and its determinant q˜˜ so that q\r
ab =\r
˜q˜\r
ab\r
q˜˜\r
. I will use also the SO(3) connection\r
Γ\r
i\r
a\r
compatible with the triad. The variables in the Ashtekar phase space are E˜a\r
i\r
,\r
again, and the SO(3) connection Ai\r
a\r
. The curvatures of Ai\r
a\r
and Γi\r

are respectively\r
given by F\r

the covariant derivatives defined by these connections on internal indices are2 ∇aλi =\r

I represent the density weights by the usual convention of using tildes above and below the fields.\r
2They may be extended to act on tangent indices, if necessary, by introducing a space-time\r
torsion-free connection; for example the Christoffel connection Γc\r
ab built from q\r
ab. All the results\r
presented in the paper will be independent of such extension\r

where R is the scalar curvature of the three-metric qab (the inverse of q\r

The parameter ζ is used to control the space-time signature. For Lorentzian signatures\r
we have ζ = −1 whereas in the Euclidean case we have ζ = +1. The constraints (1)\r
generate internal SO(3) rotations, diffeomorphisms and time evolution. I write now\r

and thus, the transformation is canonical. Introducing (3, 4) in the constraints (1)\r
we get immediately the following constraints in the Ashtekar phase space\r

i = 0 (6)\r

They are the Gauss law, vector and scalar constraints of the Ashtekar formulation.\r
The traditional attitude with regard to (8) has been to consider that the last term\r
introduces unnecessary complications in the formalism. For this reason it has always\r
been cancelled by choosing β such that β\r
2\r
ζ − 1 = 0. For Euclidean signatures\r
we can take β\r
2 = 1 and remain within the limits of the real theory. For Lorentzian\r
signatures, however, we are forced to take β\r
2 = −1 and then the variables (specifically\r
the connection) cease to be real. It must be emphasized that this is true only if we\r
insist in cancelling the last term in (8). If we accept to keep it, there is no reason to\r
introduce complex objects in the theory. The value of β (as long as it is different from\r
zero) is also irrelevant so we can choose β = −1 and have the following Hamiltonian\r
constraint in the Lorentzian case\r

The relevant Poisson bracket in (5) becomes\r

Since we have obtained this result by performing a canonical transformation, the\r
Poisson algebra of the constraints is preserved. If we define the functionals\r
G[N\r

we have the usual Poisson algebra; in particular the Poisson bracket of S[\r
˜\r
N ] and\r
S[\r
˜\r
M] is given by\r
{S[\r
˜\r
N ], S[\r

The + sign in the right-hand side of (12) shows that we have, indeed, Lorentzian\r
signature. It is possible to rewrite (9) in a more appealing form. The second term,\r
in particular, can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives of E˜a\r
i\r
. To this end I\r
introduce the inverse of E˜a\r
√i\r
E\r

where E\r
˜˜ ≡ det E˜a\r

and rewrite (9) in the form\r

The last term in the previous formula is still quadratic in the connections but its\r
dependence on E˜a\r
i\r
is complicated. It must be noted also that if we restrict ourselves\r
to non-degenerate triads it can be cast in polynomial form (of degree 8 in E˜a\r
i\r
) by\r
multiplying it by the square of E\r
˜˜. If one is interested in checking explicitly the\r
Poisson algebra and use the Hamiltonian constraint (14), it is useful to notice that\r
eai[E˜] and −2˜η\r
abc∇beci are canonically conjugate objects. This may eventually be\r
useful in order to write the new Hamiltonian constraint in terms of loop variables\r
maybe by allowing us to extend the set of T-variables with objects built out of eai[E˜]\r
and −2˜η\r
abc∇beci.\r
There is another appealing way to write a Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian\r
general relativity in terms of real Ashtekar variables. One starts by writing the\r
5

Hamiltonian constraint in the SO(3)-ADM formalism in the form\r

Now, in the Lorentzian case we can choose β\r
2 = 1 and cancel the last term to give\r
2qR˜˜ + ǫ\r
ijkE˜a\r
i E˜bjFabk = 0 (16)\r
remembering now that\r
qR˜˜ = −ǫ\r
ijkE˜a\r
i E˜bjRabk (17)\r
we can finally write the Hamiltonian constraint as3\r
ǫ\r
ijkE˜a\r
i E˜bj\r
(Fabk − 2Rabk) = 0 (18)\r
The geometrical interpretation of the term that we must add to the familiar Hamil\u0002tonian constraint in the Ashtekar formulation in order to describe Lorentzian gravity\r
in the Ashtekar phase space is simpler than in (14); it is just the curvature of the\r
SO(3) connection compatible with the triad E˜a\r
i\r
. Some comments are now in order.\r
First, the presence of a potential term in (14) and (18) certainly makes them more\r
complicated than the familiar Ashtekar Hamiltonian constraint. Taking into account\r
that one of the sources of difficulties in the ADM formalism is precisely the presence\r
of a potential term in the Hamiltonian constraint (see [9] and references therein for\r
examples on how the quantization of ADM gravity would simplify in the absence of\r
such a term) it is fair to expect some difficulties in the treatment of the theory with\r
this new Hamiltonian constraint. The simplification brought about by removing the\r
reality conditions has been traded for a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint.\r
3\r
It is my understanding that this formulation was independently considered by Ashtekar [8] before\r
the loop variables formalism had been introduced, and discarded due to the presence of the potential\r
term.\r
6

The way the difference between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases arises is rather\r
interesting; there is potential term in the Lorentzian case that is absent in the Eu\u0002clidean formulation. This asymmetry between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases\r
is somehow puzzling. Why is it that the ”complicated formulation” is found for the\r
Lorentzian case? In the ADM formalism such an asymmetry is not apparent in the\r
formalism.\r
The fact that the theory is written in an SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space makes it\r
possible to attempt its quantization by using loop variables. This can be achieved in\r
principle because we know [10] that loop variables are good coordinates (modulo sets\r
of measure zero) in the (Gauss law reduced) constraint hypersurface. The key problem\r
is now how to write the potential term in terms of the familiar loop variables. The\r
obvious solution would be to add additional objects built with traces of holonomies\r
of the connection Γi\r
a\r
, notice, however, that it is not straightforward to add them\r
to the set of elementary variables T\r
0 and T1 because this would spoil the closure\r
under the Poisson brackets. It is worthwhile noting that the possibility of writing the\r
Hamiltonian constraint for real Lorentzian general relativity in the two alternative\r
forms (14) and (18) may be useful when trying to write them in terms of loop variables.\r
It is conceivable that one form may be simpler to deal with than the other.\r
The form of the constraints of the theory makes it possible to use an approach\r
similar to that of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson in [11] to solve both the vector and\r
scalar constraints. We define, for non degenerate triads, the matrix ψij as\r
ψijE˜a\r
j = B˜ai − 2R˜ai\r
(19)\r
where\r
B˜c\r
i ≡ η˜\r
abcFabi (20)\r
R˜c\r
i ≡ η˜\r
abcRabi (21)\r
7

the scalar constraint is then\r
ǫ\r
ijk\r
˜\r
ηabcE˜a\r
i E˜bjψklE˜cl = 2Etrψ ˜˜ = 0 =⇒ trψ = 0 (22)\r
The vector constraint can be rewritten now as\r
E˜a\r
i\r
(F\r
i\r
ab − 2R\r
i\r
ab) = 0 ⇐⇒ E˜\r
[a\r
i\r
(B˜b]i − 2R˜b]i) = 0 (23)\r
because the relation Ri\r
ab = −\r
1\r
2\r
ǫ\r
ijkR d\r
abc e\r
j\r
c\r
e\r
k\r
d\r
and the Bianchi identity R d\r
[abc] = 0 (the\r
three dimensional Riemann tensor built with q\r
ab) imply that E˜a\r
i Riab = 0. We have\r
then\r
E˜\r
[a\r
i E˜\r
b]\r
j ψij = 0 =⇒ ψ[ij] = 0 (24)\r
so that a symmetric and traceless ψij solves both the vector and scalar constraints. As\r
in the usual case we are left with one last equation: the Gauss law. Here is where the\r
main difference between the usual Hamiltonian constraint and (18) arises. Without\r
the potential term of (18) we could very easily write the remaining equation in terms\r
of Aai and ψij\r
∇a[ψ\r
−1\r
ij B˜aj\r
] = 0 (25)\r
Now the situation is more complicated because we are forced to consider a system of\r
coupled PDE’s\r
∇a[ψ\r
−1\r
ij (B˜aj − 2R˜aj\r
)] = 0 (26)\r
ψijE˜a\r
j = B˜ai − 2R˜ai\r
(27)\r
The second equation could be solved, in principle, for E˜a\r
i\r
and then the first would\r
become an equation for ψij and Ai\r
a only as in (25).\r
The main result presented in this letter has been the introduction of several alter\u0002native forms for the Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian space-times in the Ashtekar\r
formalism with real variables. The problem of implementing the reality conditions in\r
the theory has been transformed into the problem of working with the new Hamilto\u0002nian constraints introduced here.\r
8

The previous results strongly suggest that Lorentzian general relativity is a theory\r
of two SO(3) connections (in the sense that both the curvatures of Ai\r
a and Γia\r
seem\r
to be playing a role as is apparent in (18)). A completely different two-connection\r
formulation for both Euclidean and Lorentzian general relativity has been reported\r
elsewhere [12]. In that formulation the main difference between the Euclidean and\r
Lorentzian cases is the appearance of terms depending on the difference of the curva\u0002tures for the Lorentzian signature case. The fact that, even for Lorentzian signatures,\r
the Hamiltonian constraint of that formulation is a low order polynomial of the cur\u0002vatures makes it suitable to be written in terms of loop variables built with the two\r
connections. My hope is that the comparison of the several different approaches\r
discussed above may provide useful information about the way to proceed with the\r
quantization program for general relativity and the role of complex fields in it.\r

ABSTRACT\r
I suggest in this letter a new strategy to attack the problem of the reality condi\u0002tions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum general relativity. By writing\r
a modified Hamiltonian constraint in the usual SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space I show\r
that it is possible to describe space-times with Lorentzian signature without the in\u0002troduction of complex variables. All the features of the Ashtekar formalism related to\r
the geometrical nature of the new variables are retained; in particular, it is still pos\u0002sible, in principle, to use the loop variables approach in the passage to the quantum\r
theory. The key issue in the new formulation is how to deal with the more compli\u0002cated Hamiltonian constraint that must be used in order to avoid the introduction of\r
complex fields.

The purpose of this letter is to suggest a new strategy to deal with the problem\r
of the reality conditions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum gravity.\r
At the present moment there is some consensus about the reasons behind the success\r
of the Ashtekar variables program [1]. One of them is the geometrical nature of the\r
new variables. In particular, the fact that the configuration variable is a connection\r
is specially interesting because this allows us to use loop variables both at the clas\u0002sical and quantum level [2]. Another advantage of the formalism is the simplicity of\r
the constraints –specially the Hamiltonian constraint– that has been very helpful in\r
finding solutions to all of them. There are, however, some difficulties in the formalism\r
that must be solved and are not present in the traditional ADM scheme [3]. The most\r

Lorentzian signature space-times. This is often put in relation with the fact that the\r
definition of self-duality in these space-times demands the introduction of imaginary\r
coefficients. The now accepted way to deal with this issue is the introduction of real\u0002ity conditions. They impose some consistency requirements on the scalar product in\r
the Hilbert space of physical states. In fact, the hope is that this scalar product can\r
be selected by the reality conditions. There are, however some difficulties with this\r
approach too. Specifically it is very difficult to implement the reality conditions in\r
the loop variables scheme. Only recently some positive results in this direction have\r
been reported [6]. The main point of this letter is to consider the geometrical nature\r
of the Ashtekar variables as the most important asset of the formalism. With this\r
idea in mind, it is easy to see that the introduction of complex variables is necessary\r
only if one wants to have an specially simple form for the Hamiltonian constraint. If\r
we accept to live with a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint in the Ashtekar\r
phase space we can use real variables.\r
An interesting consequence of this, as emphasized by Rovelli and Smolin, is that\r
all the results obtained within the loop variables approach (existence of volume and\r
1

area observables, weave states and so on [4], [5]) whose derivation is independent\r
of the particular form of the scalar constraint scalar can be maintained even for\r
Lorentzian signature space-times because it is possible to describe Lorentzian gravity\r
with real fields in the Ashtekar phase space. More specifically, the issue is not the\r
implementation of the reality conditions (at least at the kinematical) but rather the\r
construction of a scalar product, normalizability of the quantum physical states and\r
so on. The proposal presented in this letter does not address this problems. It must\r
also be said that the construction of area and volume observables referred to above\r
must still be put in a completely sound and rigorous mathematical basis that may very\r
well be provided by the approach presented in [6] to incorporate the reality conditions\r
in the loop variables approach by using a generalization of th e Bargmann-Siegel\r
transform to spaces of connections. This letter has nothing to add with respect to\r
this. In the following, tangent space indices and SO(3) indices will be represented by\r
lowercase Latin letters from the beginning and the middle of the alphabet respectively.\r
The 3-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor density and its inverse will be denoted1 by\r
η˜\r
abc and\r
˜\r
ηabc and the internal SO(3) Levi-Civita tensor by ǫijk. The variables in\r
the SO(3)-ADM phase space (ADM formalism with internal SO(3) symmetry as\r
discussed in [7]) are a densitized triad E˜a\r
i\r
(with determinant denoted by E\r
˜˜) and its\r
canonically conjugate object Ki\r
a\r
(closely related to the extrinsic curvature). The\r
(densitized) three dimensional metric built from the triad will be denoted ˜q˜\r
ab ≡\r
E˜a\r
i E˜bi and its determinant q˜˜ so that q\r

The parameter ζ is used to control the space-time signature. For Lorentzian signatures\r
we have ζ = −1 whereas in the Euclidean case we have ζ = +1. The constraints (1)\r

They are the Gauss law, vector and scalar constraints of the Ashtekar formulation.\r
The traditional attitude with regard to (8) has been to consider that the last term\r
introduces unnecessary complications in the formalism. For this reason it has always\r
been cancelled by choosing β such that β\r
2\r
ζ − 1 = 0. For Euclidean signatures\r
we can take β\r
2 = 1 and remain within the limits of the real theory. For Lorentzian\r
signatures, however, we are forced to take β\r
2 = −1 and then the variables (specifically\r
the connection) cease to be real. It must be emphasized that this is true only if we\r
insist in cancelling the last term in (8). If we accept to keep it, there is no reason to\r
introduce complex objects in the theory. The value of β (as long as it is different from\r
zero) is also irrelevant so we can choose β = −1 and have the following Hamiltonian\r
constraint in the Lorentzian case\r

The + sign in the right-hand side of (12) shows that we have, indeed, Lorentzian\r
signature. It is possible to rewrite (9) in a more appealing form. The second term,\r
in particular, can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives of E˜a\r

The last term in the previous formula is still quadratic in the connections but its\r
dependence on E˜a\r
i\r
is complicated. It must be noted also that if we restrict ourselves\r
to non-degenerate triads it can be cast in polynomial form (of degree 8 in E˜a\r
i\r
) by\r
multiplying it by the square of E\r
˜˜. If one is interested in checking explicitly the\r
Poisson algebra and use the Hamiltonian constraint (14), it is useful to notice that\r
eai[E˜] and −2˜η\r
abc∇beci are canonically conjugate objects. This may eventually be\r
useful in order to write the new Hamiltonian constraint in terms of loop variables\r
maybe by allowing us to extend the set of T-variables with objects built out of eai[E˜]\r

There is another appealing way to write a Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian\r
general relativity in terms of real Ashtekar variables. One starts by writing the"""

The geometrical interpretation of the term that we must add to the familiar Hamil\u0002tonian constraint in the Ashtekar formulation in order to describe Lorentzian gravity\r
in the Ashtekar phase space is simpler than in (14); it is just the curvature of the\r
SO(3) connection compatible with the triad E˜a\r
i\r
. Some comments are now in order.\r
First, the presence of a potential term in (14) and (18) certainly makes them more\r
complicated than the familiar Ashtekar Hamiltonian constraint. Taking into account\r
that one of the sources of difficulties in the ADM formalism is precisely the presence\r
of a potential term in the Hamiltonian constraint (see [9] and references therein for\r
examples on how the quantization of ADM gravity would simplify in the absence of\r
such a term) it is fair to expect some difficulties in the treatment of the theory with\r
this new Hamiltonian constraint. The simplification brought about by removing the\r
reality conditions has been traded for a more complicated Hamiltonian constraint.\r
3\r
It is my understanding that this formulation was independently considered by Ashtekar [8] before\r
the loop variables formalism had been introduced, and discarded due to the presence of the potential\r
term.\r
6

The way the difference between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases arises is rather\r
interesting; there is potential term in the Lorentzian case that is absent in the Eu\u0002clidean formulation. This asymmetry between the Euclidean and Lorentzian cases\r
is somehow puzzling. Why is it that the ”complicated formulation” is found for the\r
Lorentzian case? In the ADM formalism such an asymmetry is not apparent in the\r
formalism.\r
The fact that the theory is written in an SO(3) Yang-Mills phase space makes it\r
possible to attempt its quantization by using loop variables. This can be achieved in\r
principle because we know [10] that loop variables are good coordinates (modulo sets\r
of measure zero) in the (Gauss law reduced) constraint hypersurface. The key problem\r
is now how to write the potential term in terms of the familiar loop variables. The\r
obvious solution would be to add additional objects built with traces of holonomies\r
of the connection Γi\r
a\r
, notice, however, that it is not straightforward to add them\r
to the set of elementary variables T\r
0 and T1 because this would spoil the closure\r
under the Poisson brackets. It is worthwhile noting that the possibility of writing the\r
Hamiltonian constraint for real Lorentzian general relativity in the two alternative\r
forms (14) and (18) may be useful when trying to write them in terms of loop variables.\r
It is conceivable that one form may be simpler to deal with than the other.\r
The form of the constraints of the theory makes it possible to use an approach\r
similar to that of Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson in [11] to solve both the vector and\r
scalar constraints. We define, for non degenerate triads, the matrix ψij as\r
ψijE˜a\r
j = B˜ai − 2R˜ai\r
(19)\r
where\r
B˜c\r
i ≡ η˜\r
abcFabi (20)\r
R˜c\r
i ≡ η˜\r
abcRabi (21)\r

the scalar constraint is then\r

ijk\r
˜\r
ηabcE˜a\r
i E˜bjψklE˜cl = 2Etrψ ˜˜ = 0 =⇒ trψ = 0 (22)\r
The vector constraint can be rewritten now as\r

i\r
(F\r
i\r
ab − 2R\r
i\r
ab) = 0 ⇐⇒ E˜\r
[a\r

because the relation Ri\r

and the Bianchi identity R d\r

i Riab = 0. We have\r
then\r
E˜\r
[a\r
i E˜\r
b]\r
j ψij = 0 =⇒ ψ[ij] = 0 (24)\r
so that a symmetric and traceless ψij solves both the vector and scalar constraints. As\r
in the usual case we are left with one last equation: the Gauss law. Here is where the\r
main difference between the usual Hamiltonian constraint and (18) arises. Without\r
the potential term of (18) we could very easily write the remaining equation in terms\r
of Aai and ψij\r
∇a[ψ\r
−1\r
ij B˜aj\r
] = 0 (25)\r
Now the situation is more complicated because we are forced to consider a system of\r
coupled PDE’s\r
∇a[ψ\r
−1\r
ij (B˜aj − 2R˜aj\r
)] = 0 (26)\r
ψijE˜a\r
j = B˜ai − 2R˜ai\r
(27)\r
The second equation could be solved, in principle, for E˜a\r
i\r
and then the first would\r
become an equation for ψij and Ai\r
a only as in (25).\r
The main result presented in this letter has been the introduction of several alter\u0002native forms for the Hamiltonian constraint for Lorentzian space-times in the Ashtekar\r
formalism with real variables. The problem of implementing the reality conditions in\r
the theory has been transformed into the problem of working with the new Hamilto\u0002nian constraints introduced here.\r
8

The previous results strongly suggest that Lorentzian general relativity is a theory\r
of two SO(3) connections (in the sense that both the curvatures of Ai\r
a and Γia\r
seem\r
to be playing a role as is apparent in (18)). A completely different two-connection\r
formulation for both Euclidean and Lorentzian general relativity has been reported\r
elsewhere [12]. In that formulation the main difference between the Euclidean and\r
Lorentzian cases is the appearance of terms depending on the difference of the curva\u0002tures for the Lorentzian signature case. The fact that, even for Lorentzian signatures,\r
the Hamiltonian constraint of that formulation is a low order polynomial of the cur\u0002vatures makes it suitable to be written in terms of loop variables built with the two\r
connections. My hope is that the comparison of the several different approaches\r
discussed above may provide useful information about the way to proceed with the\r
quantization program for general relativity and the role of complex fields in it.\r
