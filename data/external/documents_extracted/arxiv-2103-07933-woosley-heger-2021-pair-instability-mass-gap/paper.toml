THE PAIR-INSTABILITY MASS GAP FOR BLACK HOLES\r
S. E. Woosley1 and Alexander Heger2-5\r
Draft version March 16, 2021\r
ABSTRACT\r
Stellar evolution theory predicts a “gap” in the black hole birth function caused by the pair in\u0002stability. Presupernova stars that have a core mass below some limiting value, Mlow, after all pul\u0002sational activity is finished, collapse to black holes, while more massive ones, up to some limiting\r
value, Mhigh, explode, promptly and completely, as pair-instability supernovae. Previous work has\r
suggested Mlow ≈ 50 M\f and Mhigh ≈ 130 M\f. These calculations have been challenged by recent\r
LIGO observations that show many black holes merging with individual masses, Mlow >∼ 65 M\f. Here\r
we explore four factors affecting the theoretical estimates for the boundaries of this mass gap: nuclear\r
reaction rates, evolution in detached binaries, rotation, and hyper-Eddington accretion after black\r
hole birth. Current uncertainties in reaction rates by themselves allow Mlow to rise to 64 M\f and\r
Mhigh as large as 161 M\f. Rapid rotation could further increase Mlow to ∼ 70 M\f, depending on the\r
treatment of magnetic torques. Evolution in detached binaries and super-Eddington accretion can,\r
with great uncertainty, increase Mlow still further. Dimensionless Kerr parameters close to unity are\r
allowed for the more massive black holes produced in close binaries, though they are generally smaller.\r

1. INTRODUCTION\r
Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN) and\r
pair-instability supernovae (PISN) are of interest because\r
of their potential roles in early stellar nucleosynthesis\r
(Heger & Woosley 2002), in explaining unusual types of\r
supernovae (Woosley et al. 2007), and as the progenitors\r
of massive black hole systems that can merge and pro\u0002duce detectable gravitational radiation signals (Woosley\r
2016). Of particular current interest is the prediction\r
of a “mass gap” between about 50 M\f (henceforth Mlow;\r
Woosley et al. 2007; Belczynski et al. 2016; Woosley 2017,\r
2019) and 130 M\f (Mhigh; Heger & Woosley 2002) where\r
very few black holes should exist in close binaries that\r
merge in a Hubble time.\r
The existence, or at least the boundaries of such a gap\r
have been challenged by the discovery of a single merging\r
black hole pair in which the more massive component had\r
a mass near 85 M\f (Abbott et al. 2020a,b), and, more re\u0002cently, by the publication of a catalog of sources (Abbott\r
et al. 2020) in which numerous black holes merging by\r
gravitational radiation have masses in the 60 to 70 M\f\r
range. Other recent theoretical papers have pointed out\r
the sensitivity of the boundaries of the putative mass\r
gap to uncertainties in reaction rates (Farmer et al. 2020;\r
Costa et al. 2020), the effects of rotation (Marchant &\r
Moriya 2020), and super-Eddington accretion (van Son et\r
al. 2020). These papers were submitted while the present\r

one was in preparation, and now take precedence. It re\u0002mains, useful, however to examine the role of this physics\r
using different sets of assumptions in a single code and to\r
attempt an evaluation of which of the causes is dominant.\r
Specifically we consider four possibilities for produc\u0002ing black hole remnants in close binaries with individual\r
masses substantially heavier than 50 M\f: 1) A decrease\r
in the rate for the 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and/or an increase in the\r
rate for the triple-alpha (3α) reaction (§2). The range\r
of rates considered is only what is currently favored by\r
experiment. Our choices might thus be regarded as con\u0002servative, but are influenced both by experiment and nu\u0002cleosynthetic considerations (§2.2). These changes alone\r
can potentially raise Mlow to 64 M\f, but are unlikely, by\r
themselves, to increase Mlow to 85 M\f. 2) Making the\r
black hole in a detached binary (§3). Using the variation\r
in rates discussed in §2, it is possible to produce black\r
holes of 100 M\f or more if the star’s hydrogen envelope is\r
retained at the time of core collapse. The obvious prob\u0002lems here are the low mass loss rate required and the\r
difficulty getting the two black holes together at the end,\r
if one of them was made in a supernova that was a giant\r
star when it exploded. 3) The effects of rapid rotation\r
(§4). The dynamical effects of rotation alone can only\r
increase Mlow modestly (Marchant & Moriya 2020), but\r
rotation coupled with uncertain reaction rates can raise\r
Mlow to ∼ 70 M\f. In the most extreme cases, the angu\u0002lar momentum in the presupernova star is too great to\r
form a black hole without the loss of angular momentum\r
and an uncertain amount of mass. 4) Super-Eddington\r
accretion after the first black hole has formed (§5). As\r
the secondary expands just following hydrogen depletion,\r
a stable phase of frictionally-driven mass loss (Podsiad\u0002lowski 2001) might substantially increase the mass of the\r
black hole produced by the primary. This involves some\r
very uncertain physics, but is the most likely way to pro\u0002duce black holes well over 70 M\f in a single close binary.\r
Our computational approach is the same as in Woosley\r

(2017), except with the addition of centrifugal force\r
to the structure equations (§4). All models are calcu\u0002lated using the Kepler code (Weaver, Zimmerman, &\r
Woosley 1978; Woosley et al. 2002) and the physics de\u0002scribed in those papers. In particular, the previous stan\u0002dard values for the reaction rates that are varied are\r
taken from deBoer et al. (2017) and Buchmann (1996)\r
for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and Caughlan & Fowler (1988) for 3α.\r
Unless otherwise noted, mass loss rates for giant stars,\r
which are relevant for §3, are taken from Nieuwenhui\u0002jzen & de Jager (1990) and Yoon (2017), the latter being\r
an amalgamation of Hanich et al. (2014) and Tramper,\r
Sana, and de Koter (2016).\r
2. VARIABLE CARBON PRODUCTION\r
The pair-instability begins mildly, following the central\r
depletion of helium. As the star contracts towards car\u0002bon and, ultimately, oxygen ignition, more pairs are pro\u0002duced at the higher temperature required for burning and\r
the instability becomes stronger. Central carbon burning\r
is net endoergic in stars of this large mass, with the en\u0002ergy generation rate never exceeding neutrino losses, and\r
hence proceeding in a radiative fashion. Far enough out,\r
however, carbon shell burning becomes exoergic, even\r
in the face of neutrino losses, and can power convective\r
shells whose strength and extent affects the subsequent\r
dynamics of the implosion. Helium shell burning in the\r
outer layers of the star can have a similar, though usually\r
smaller effect.\r
After central carbon depletion, infalling matter gath\u0002ers momentum that often, but not always results in dy\u0002namical overshoot and explosive oxygen burning. A vari\u0002able carbon abundance in the outer layers of the star can\r
provide varying degrees of support as the core becomes\r
unstable. This can dramatically influence the strength\r
of the instability and the energy, or even the possibility\r
of a subsequent explosion (Farmer et al. 2020). Basi\u0002cally a strong carbon burning shell provides an energy\r
source that increases as the star contracts. Sufficient off\u0002center burning results in oxygen burning igniting stably\r
rather that catastrophically, and the subsequent evolu\u0002tion is very different. Oxygen burning in a shell can still\r
become unstable later, even during silicon burning, but\r
there is less fuel to burn then, and the instability usually\r
results in less matter being ejected.\r
2.1. Reaction Rates\r
Substantial adjustments to the carbon abundance af\u0002ter helium burning are possible because of uncertainties\r
in the critical reaction rates for 3α and 12C(α, γ)\r
16O\r
and the treatment of convective mixing (Farmer et al.\r
2019, 2020; Renzo et al. 2020). Historically, the rate\r
for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O during helium burning has been a ma\u0002jor source of uncertainty for studies of stellar evolution\r
and nucleosynthesis (Weaver & Woosley 1993; Tur et al.\r
2010; West et al. 2013). This rate is characterized by an\r
“S-factor” evaluated at a typical Gamow energy for re\u0002actions during helium burning, which is taken to be 300\r
keV. deBoer et al. (2017) have reviewed the experimental\r
situation and offered their own analysis, concluding that\r
this critical S-factor is most likely 140 ± 21 +18\r
−11 keV b.\r
This is smaller than some other recent publications (see\r
their Table IV) which gave a value near 165 keV b, but\r
usually with larger error bars. In particular, Buchmann\r
(1996), which serves as a reference point in the present\r
study, gave a best value of S300 = 146 keV b with a pos\u0002sible range from 62 to 270 kev,b (see also Buchmann &\r
Barnes 2006). In the same time frame Buchmann et al.\r
(1996) found a best value of S300 =165 ± 75 keV b. Here\r
we shall consider a possible range of S-factors from 110\r
to 205 keV b with a standard value 146 keV b. The lower\r
bound is that of deBoer et al. (2017). The upper bound is\r
a bit larger than theirs, and more consistent with Buch\u0002mann et al. (1996). Past studies of nucleosynthesis (§2.2)\r
have favored such large values. Computationally these\r
variations were effected by multiplying the standard fit\u0002ted rate of Buchmann (1996) by factors, fBuch, ranging\r
from 0.75 to 1.4 (Table 1). As will be shown, Mlow is\r
more sensitive to the rate for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O when it is\r
small than when it is large, which justifies, for now, not\r
exploring larger multipliers than 1.4.\r
Shen et al. (2020) have given a recent reevaluation of\r
the electric quadrupole part of the reaction rate SE2 = 80\r
±40 keV b which is larger than the 45 keV b adopted by\r
deBoer et al. (2017) and more consistent with Buchmann\r
et al. (1996). They recommend that the error bar on the\r
deBoer et al. rate be raised from +18 to +39 keV b,\r
i.e., the total S-factor is more likely to be larger than\r
146 keV b than smaller.\r
The rate for the 3α reaction depends on the radiative\r
width for the “Hoyle state”, a 0+ resonance at an exci\u0002tation energy of 7.65 MeV in 12C. A small correction is\r
generally added to the radiative width for pair emission.\r
Summarizing previous work, Freer & Fynbo (2014) gave\r
what might be considered the previous standard value\r
for this width, Γrad = 3.78 meV (i.e., 3.78 × 10−3eV).\r
This is close to the value used in Caughlan & Fowler\r
(1988), Γrad+pair = 3.70 meV (Hale in Wallerstein et al.\r
1997). New recent measurements (Kib´edi et al. 2020;\r
Eriksen et al. 2020), though by no means the final word,\r
give Γrad = 5.1(6) meV, implying an upward revision of\r
about 35 %. This large increase is substantially outside\r
the error bar of previous measurements and has major\r
implications for stellar nucleosynthesis (§2.2), but is con\u0002sidered here, for now, as a limiting case. Traditionally\r
this reaction rate was assumed to be known to 15 % ac\u0002curacy (e.g., Rolfs & Rodney 1988). In the present study,\r
we define f3α as the multiplier on the Caughlan & Fowler\r
(1988) rate for 3α. This is f3α = 1.35 corresponds ap\u0002proximately to the new rate of Kib´edi et al. (2020).\r
2.2. Nucleosynthetic limits\r
In our past works, including Woosley (2017), the mul\u0002tiplying factor in Kepler for the Buchmann (1996) rec\u0002ommended value (146 keV b) was fBuch = 1.2. Within\r
the context of a then very large range of possible val\u0002ues for the S-factor, Weaver & Woosley (1993) carried\r
out a survey of nucleosynthesis in massive stars to deter\u0002mine what value worked best for nucleosynthesis, finding\r
S300 = 170 ± 20 keV b. That value was used in Kepler\r
prior to 1996. After 1996, this was refined to be 1.2 times\r
the rate given by Buchmann (1996), or S300 = 175 keV b.\r
This value has remained constant ever since, in part, to\r
facilitate comparison among various calculations carried\r
out with the Kepler code, but has always remained\r
within the experimental error bar and close to its cen\u0002troid.

3\r
Tur et al. (2007) and Tur et al. (2010) studied the\r
influence of uncertainties in the 3α and 12C(α, γ)\r
16O re\u0002actions on nucleosynthesis and found that an increase in\r
the 3α rate of 10 % had about the same effect as an 8 %\r
decrease in 12C(α, γ)\r
16O. Hence, for small variations, it\r
is the the ratio of the reaction rates, λαγ(\r
12C)/λ3α (or\r
f3α/fBuch), that matters most. West et al. (2013) and\r
Austin et al. (2014) considered constraints on the ratio\r
of these two rates required to fit nucleosynthesis in mas\u0002sive stars. They found that multipliers that gave a best\r
fit obeyed the relation fBuch = 1.0 f3α + (0.35 ± 0.2),\r
including the effect on the s-process (their Rα,12 and\r
R3α are equivalent to our fBuch and f3α). The best fit\r
using only the intermediate-mass isotopes was fBuch =\r
1.0f3α + (0.25 ± 0.3). That is, nucleosynthesis favored a\r
relatively large rate for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O, fBuch ∼ 1.3, and\r
any increase in 3α required a commensurate increase in\r
the rate for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O.\r
We will be exploring values outside this recommended\r
range, including values of fBuch as low as 0.75 and f3α as\r
large as 1.35. This large decrease in the ratio of the rates\r
is necessary to appreciably raise the black hole mass, but\r
may have negative implications for nucleosynthesis that\r
will need to be explored in the future. See Fig. 4 of West\r
et al. (2013).\r
2.3. Non-rotating Helium Stars of Constant Mass\r
In a very close binary, where little or no extended hy\u0002drogen envelope can be tolerated, the evolution of pure\r
helium stars can be used to approximate the final pre\u0002supernova state (e.g., Woosley 2017). Helium stars or\r
carbon-oxygen stars will also be the end state of evo\u0002lution where the metallicity is sufficiently high that the\r
envelope is lost to a wind or the rotation so rapid as to\r
induce chemically homogeneous evolution (Maeder 1987)\r
on the main sequence. Once revealed the helium star\r
will also experience mass loss by winds, especially if the\r
metallicity is large. During the post-helium burning evo\u0002lution, the evolution is so fast that mass loss by winds is\r
negligible. As will be shown (§2.4), helium cores evolved\r
at constant mass are a good approximation to the evo\u0002lution of heavier helium cores that include mass loss. It\r
is the final mass that matters.\r
This simplification motivates a study of reaction-rate\r
sensitivity in helium stars stars of constant mass. Similar\r
studies have been carried out by Farmer et al. (2019) and\r
Farmer et al. (2020). We consider here the variation of\r
just the rates for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α because of their\r
key role in determining the carbon abundance when the\r
star becomes unstable. It is assumed that once an iron\r
core is formed, typically around 2 M\f, that iron core and\r
all the remaining star collapses to a black hole. This will\r
not necessarily be the case if the star is very rapidly\r
rotating (§4).\r
Models are calculated using the Kepler code and the\r
same physics and zoning as in Woosley (2017). Convec\u0002tion is left on during interpulse periods, but only in the\r
core where where hydrostatic equilibrium prevails. Con\u0002vection speeds are always limited to 20 % sonic, and con\u0002vective velocities do not adjust instantaneously, but with\r
a growth rate that is limited to the (inverse of the) con\u0002vective time scale. Interpulse convection can sometime\r
play an important role in mixing combustible fuel, i.e.,\r
helium and carbon to deeper depths in the star where it\r
affects the strength of the next pulse. All models con\u0002tained in excess of 2,400 mass shells, with finer zoning\r
near the center and surface. Typical simulations took\r
about 20,000 time steps, though sometimes much more,\r
to reach core collapse. Nuclear energy generation was\r
generally treated using the 19 isotope approximation net\u0002work in Kepler and the 128 isotope quasiequilibrium\r
network once the central oxygen mass fraction fell be\u0002low 0.05. About 20 models were also calculated using\r
an adaptable network (Rauscher et al. 2002) with typi\u0002cally 250 isotopes from hydrogen to germanium coupled\r
directly to the structure calculation. Changing networks\r
caused final remnant masses to vary by at most 1 M\f ex\u0002cept near the critical mass where the star fully exploded\r
after the first pulse (§2.3.2). Small differences made a\r
large difference in outcome for these cases, but the value\r
of Mlow for a given choice of nuclear physics was not\r
greatly affected.\r
2.3.1. Lower Boundary to the Pair-Instability Mass Gap\r
Results for Mlow are given in Table 1. As dis\u0002cussed by Farmer et al. (2019), decreasing the rate for\r
12C(α, γ)16O, or raising the rate for 3α results in a larger\r
amount of carbon being present in the outer part of the\r
star when the pair-instability is first encountered after\r
central carbon depletion. The energy generated in these\r
shells inhibits the collapse to oxygen ignition and thus\r
makes the explosion milder. In cases with large carbon\r
abundance, i.e., low 12C(α, γ)\r
16O or high 3α, the energy\r
from carbon shell burning can even trigger its own series\r
of weak pair-instability pulsations. This affects the final\r
remnant mass very little, but might provide a low mass\r
shell around the star when it finally dies.\r
A key point is that if the carbon abundance is large\r
enough, central oxygen burning can ignite stably with en\u0002ergy transported by convection. If a substantial amount\r
of oxygen burns stably, then the reservoir of fuel for fu\u0002ture explosive events is reduced, even if they occur. The\r
pulsational pair instability is thus weakened. Less mat\u0002ter is ejected with lower energy. This trend of weaker\r
pulsations when the carbon abundance is high is appar\u0002ent in Table 1. Though the focus here is on remnant\r
masses, this behavior also has important implications for\r
the properties of any supernovae resulting from the pul\u0002sational pair instability. The energies are still sufficient\r
to power a bright Type II supernova in stars where a\r
hydrogen envelope is retained. The light curves of these\r
supernova will lack radioactive tails and eject almost no\r
new heavy elements, but the energy and brightness of su\u0002pernovae resulting from colliding shells will be less. For\r
unfavorable values of reaction rates, this makes PPISN\r
even less likely to produce superluminous supernovae\r
(Woosley 2017).\r
For models with small carbon abundances, i.e., large\r
12C(α, γ)16O or small 3α rates, the characteristics of\r
PPISN are not very sensitive to the rates. Focusing on\r
just those models where only 12C(α, γ)\r
16O is varied, the\r
maximum black hole mass is 46, 46, 48, and 56 M\f for\r
rate multipliers fBuch = 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, and 0.8. For the\r
larger multipliers, the carbon burning shells are weak and\r
the pair instability is strong. These were the cases ex\u0002plored by Woosley (2017). For central carbon mass frac\u0002tions at helium burning greater than about 0.15 though,

4\r
the nature of the solution changes dramatically. For the\r
most extreme cases considered here, the pair instability\r
is essentially absent. Only some weak pulses occur near\r
the end of the stars life when the core is already well\r
into silicon burning. For intermediate values, the pair\r
instability is still present, but suppressed to a varying\r
extent.\r
Increasing the 3α rate can further raise Mlow. For\r
fBuch = 0.75 and f3α = 1.35, the maximum black hole\r
mass is near 64 M\f. Larger values could be obtained by\r
further manipulation of the rates (Farmer et al. 2019,\r
2020), and by including rotation (§4), but pending fur\u0002ther experimental studies, we regard such variations of\r
reaction rates as unlikely, especially given the potential\r
problems with nucleosynthesis.\r
2.3.2. Upper Boundary to the Pair-Instability Mass Gap\r
Uncertainties in the reaction rates can also have an\r
important effect on the upper boundary of the pair\u0002instability gap (Table 2). The least massive black hole\r
above the gap, Mhigh, now ranges from 136 to 161 M\f for\r
the same choices of reaction rates as in Table 1. There\r
is a notable shift for fBuch = 1.2 from the value given\r
by Heger & Woosley (2002), Mhigh = 133.3 M\f, to the\r
new value, Mhigh = 139 M\f, a change of 4.3 % resulting\r
solely from different code physics.\r
About half of this change comes from directly coupling\r
a large reaction network of about 200 isotopes to the stel\u0002lar structure calculation, taking smaller time steps, and\r
other minor changes to the Kepler code in the last 20\r
years. The calculations of Heger & Woosley (2002) only\r
used a 19 isotope approximation network for energy gen\u0002eration and “coprocessed” with a much larger network to\r
obtain nucleosynthesis. The quasiequilibrium network in\r
Kepler was not used due to problems at that time with\r
convectively coupled zones containing a varying amount\r
of oxygen at explosive temperatures.\r
The other half comes from different assumptions re\u0002garding convection during the implosion. In Heger &\r
Woosley (2002), it was assumed that convection did not\r
occur during the implosion once carbon was depleted in\r
the central zone. Here, for the standard cases, time\u0002dependent mixing-length convection is allowed to pro\u0002ceed in zones that are not supersonically collapsing, i.e.,\r
vcol < cs, but the convective speed used in the mixing\r
length calculation is limited, in all zones, to vconv <\r
0.2 cs. Here cs is the local sound speed. Additional stud\u0002ies in which the zonal collapse speed limiter was reduced\r
to vcol < 0.3 cs while retaining vconv < 0.2 cs showed little\r
deviation from Table 2. If those limiters were further de\u0002creased though, to vcol < 0.1 cs and vconv < 0.1 cs, Mhigh\r
was reduced. More efficient mixing of oxygen downwards\r
during the implosion leads to greater burning and in\u0002creases Mhigh. The values in Table 2 are thus probably\r
upper limits for non-rotating models and the actual val\u0002ues could be 2 % smaller. As noted previously, small\r
changes in physics can have an large effect near the cusp\r
of a transition from full collapse to full explosion. These\r
changes thus had a much greater effect on Mhigh than\r
Mlow.\r
Rotation could also substantially decrease Mhigh by\r
weakening the pair instability, but that was not explored\r
here. See §4 for the effect of rotation on Mlow.\r

2.4. Helium Stars With Mass Loss\r
Stellar winds reduce the mass of the star and alter\r
the thickness of the helium burning shell relative to the\r
carbon-oxygen core. Being farther out in the star, the\r
influence of the residual helium is reduced relative to car\u0002bon, but helium burns at a lower temperature and gen\u0002erates more energy, and so can still have a minor effect.\r
Stars with the large masses considered here have con\u0002vective helium burning cores that extend through more\r
90 % of their mass when helium is half burned, so most\r
of the post-helium burning star is carbon and oxygen.\r
Some helium always remains in the outer layers of the\r
star though, no matter what the mass loss rate (see, e.g.,\r
Table 4 of Woosley 2019). The convective core recedes\r
as mass is lost from the surface leaving a gradient of he\u0002lium outside. Typically at carbon ignition helium still\r
has an appreciable abundance in the outer 15 % of the\r
star. Burning at the base of this shell during implosion\r
drives convection that mixes additional helium down, in\u0002creasing the strength of the shell burning.\r
To illustrate the effect, we consider here a single set\r
of reaction rates, fBuch = 1.2 and f3α = 1.0, and ex\u0002plore some initial mass and mass loss combinations that\r
produce presupernova stars in the same mass range as\r
Table 1. The mass loss rate is taken from Yoon (2017)\r
for 10 % solar metallicity with fWR = 1. Vink (2017)\r
and Sander et al. (2019) predict a smaller mass loss rate\r
for such stars. Table 3 shows some results. For a typ\u0002ical case, a helium core with an initial mass of 76 M\f\r
ends up with a final mass of 55.9 M\f, mostly composed\r
of carbon and oxygen, with a central carbon fraction of\r
0.0862. This is very similar to the 56 M\f helium star\r
which, when evolved at constant mass in Table 1, had\r
a carbon mass fraction of 0.0909. The small difference\r
is because the shrinking helium convective core mixes in\r
less helium to the center in the mass-losing star towards\r
the end of helium burning. A more important difference\r
though is the amount of helium in the outer regions of\r
the star. The model with mass loss had 0.94 M\f of 4He\r
prior to pair pulsations, while the constant mass model\r
had 1.94 M\f. Both helium shells had their bases at about\r
47 M\f though, i.e., the outer 9 M\f of both presupernova\r

stars contained appreciable helium.\r
Table 3 shows that the effect of this residual helium,\r
and mass loss on the remnant mass is generally small\r
for the reaction rates considered. Comparing the re\u0002sults including mass loss to the corresponding stars with\r
fBuch = 1.2 and f3α = 1 in Table 1, Mlow is reduced by\r
less than 1 M\f. This is comparable to variations intro\u0002duced by zoning, network, and time step criteria. The\r
small effect of the helium shell also suggests that the\r
essential conclusions of Table 1 might be obtained ignor\u0002ing the helium altogether and just modeling stars of just\r
carbon and oxygen.\r
2.5. Pure Carbon-Oxygen Stars\r
Many factors affect the carbon abundance in the core\r
of a massive star following helium burning: the reaction\r
rates for 3α and 12C(α, γ)\r
16O; the treatment of semi\u0002convection and convective overshoot mixing; rotationally\r
induced mixing; radiative mass loss (§2.4); and whether\r
the star is in a mass exchanging binary (Woosley 2019).\r
Fortunately, the structure of a very massive star during\r
its final stages of helium burning is quite simple. Be\u0002cause the luminosity is nearly Eddington and the struc\u0002ture near that of an n = 3 polytrope, helium stars of the\r
mass considered are almost fully convective throughout\r
most of their helium-burning evolution. Their compo\u0002sitions and entropies, except for a small mass near the\r
surface, are nearly constant. The helium exhausted ma\u0002terial includes most of the matter that participates in\r
burning during a PPISN or PISN. The remainder, near\r
the surface, while composed of a mixture of helium and\r
carbon, has an electron mole number near Ye = 0.50.\r
The star’s structure, which is most sensitive to the elec\u0002tron density, is thus not very much affected by the ratio\r
of helium to carbon.\r
These characteristics and a desire to better understand\r
the star’s composition affects Mlow motivate an explo\u0002ration of stars consisting initially of just carbon and oxy\u0002gen in a ratio that does not vary with location in the star.\r
The composition reflects what exists at the end of helium\r
burning and condenses many of the uncertainties men\u0002tioned above into a single parameter, the carbon mass\r
fraction. Once a grid of explosions has been calculated\r
for a suitable range of carbon mass fractions, the future\r
properties of the supernova can determined for any model\r
by comparing its actual carbon mass fraction at helium\r
depletion to the grid. Since the carbon mass fraction is\r
bounded, so too is the maximum mass black hole that\r
can be produced following the pulsational-pair instabil\u0002ity.\r
Unfortunately, such a simple approach suffers from two

6\r
complications. First, as discussed in §2.4, helium shell\r
burning can weaken the pair instability. Whether the\r
outer layers of the star are carbon or helium makes lit\u0002tle difference to their structure, but the burning of he\u0002lium during the implosion can weaken the first pulse.\r
As a consequence, the remnant masses coming out of\r
pure carbon-oxygen cores could underestimate the ac\u0002tual value of Mlow. The other complication is that he\u0002lium burning in such massive stars produces not just 12C\r
and 16O, but appreciable 20Ne and even some 24Mg as\r
well. The abundances of these heavier nuclei can become\r
comparable to the carbon abundance itself for those cases\r
where the 12C(α, γ)\r
16O reaction rate is large and the 3α\r
rate small. For the converse cases, perhaps of greater\r
interest here, where the carbon abundance after helium\r
burning is large, the carbon shell dominates and both\r
the burning of helium and the abundance of neon have\r
little effect. The effects of neon are also mitigated by the\r
fact that neon burning never becomes an exoergic phase\r
in such massive stars. Neutrino losses dominate and the\r
products of neon burning are oxygen and magnesium, so\r
half the 20Ne ends up in 16O anyway. The bulk energy\r
yields of the neon-rich and neon-poor compositions also\r
differ very little. Burning the “0.05/Ne” composition in\r
Table 4 to 28Si gives 4.63 × 1017 erg g−1 whereas burning\r
the “0.05” composition to 28Si gives 4.69 × 1017 erg g−1.\r
Nevertheless, having a substantial abundance of neon can\r
sometimes affect the strength of carbon shell burning and\r
it will be necessary to demonstrate the sensitivity of the\r
answer to the neglect of neon and magnesium in the ini\u0002tial composition and of helium in the outer layers.\r
Table 4 gives the results. Carbon-oxygen stars of con\u0002stant mass with the initial carbon mass fractions indi\u0002cated were evolved until the star either completely dis\u0002perses as a PISN or its iron core collapses. Except for\r
the three columns noted, the remainder of the initial star\r
was all 16O. The range of carbon mass fractions span\r
what we consider to be reasonable values for current re\u0002action rates and convective treatments. No helium star\r
in §2.3 gave a central carbon mass fraction less than 0.05\r
or greater than 0.25. In two of the exceptional series of\r
models, those marked “0.05/Ne” and “0.1/Ne”, more re\u0002alistic neon-rich compositions were considered. Helium\r
star models in Table 1 show that when the carbon mass\r
fraction after helium burning is 0.05, the mass fractions\r
of 20Ne and 24Mg are 0.07 and 0.01 respectively. When\r
carbon is 0.1, 20Ne and 24Mg are 0.05 and 0.005. Surveys\r
using these “neon-rich” compositions are also shown for\r
comparison in Table 4.\r
The effects of a helium shell were also considered in a\r
series of models labeled “0.05/He”. In the inner 85 % of\r
their mass, these stars had compositions of 5 % carbon\r
and 95 % oxygen by mass. In their outer 15 % though\r
the composition was 5 % carbon, 90 % oxygen and 5 %\r
helium. This typically amounted to about 0.4 M\f of he\u0002lium, small even for mass losing stars (§2.4). As expected\r
the presence of helium generally led to larger black hole\r
masses. The effects of both neon and helium in the “0.05”\r
case was an increase of about 2 M\f (5 %) each in Mlow.\r
The “0.05” case should give an upper bound on these ef\u0002fects because the carbon plays an increasingly dominant\r
role in the others.\r
Comparing Table 4 for carbon-oxygen stars with Ta\u0002ble 1 for helium stars that have similar carbon mass frac\u0002tions at helium depletion, one sees that discrepancy is\r
never great, but is least when the carbon-mass fraction\r
is large. Not only is the neon abundance smaller in such\r
cases, but the effects of carbon shell burning dominate\r
those of helium shell burning. Conversely, when the car\u0002bon abundance is small, neon and helium have a big\u0002ger effect. For For X(\r
12C) = 0.05, Mlow is 41 M\f for\r
carbon-oxygen stars, but 46 M\f for helium stars with\r
fBuch = 1.4. About half the difference is due to the large\r
neon mass fraction and the other half is due to the helium\r
shell (columns “0.05/He” and “0.05/Ne”). For X(\r
12C)\r
= 0.125, on the other hand, Mlow is 47 M\f for carbon\u0002oxygen stars and 48 M\f for helium stars with fBuch = 1.\r
For X(\r
12C) = 0.25, Mlow is 64 M\f for carbon-oxygen\r
stars and 64 M\f for helium stars with fBuch = 0.75 and\r
A 3α rate 1.35 times standard. Variations of 1 - 2 M\f\r
are expected in any survey due to zoning, time step, net\u0002work, number of pulses, etc. Thus unless the carbon\r
abundance is less than about 0.1, the simpler carbon\u0002oxygen cores can be substituted for helium stars in our\r
search for Mlow.\r
As with the helium stars, the maximum black hole\r
mass in Table 4 is not very sensitive to the exact value\r
of the initial fraction of carbon so long as that frac\u0002tion is small. For carbon fractions from 0.05 to 0.15,\r
Mlow varies only between 41 and 48 M\f (and 41 M\f is\r
an underestimate as we have just discussed). For larger\r
values though, as would occur for small values of the\r
12C(α, γ)16O reaction cross section or a large value for\r
triple-alpha, Mlow increases dramatically.\r
To summarize, for a S-factor greater than 110 keV b\r
(deBoer et al. 2017) and a triple-alpha rate no greater\r
than 1.35 times the traditional value, the carbon mass\r
fraction in our models is no greater than 0.25 at helium\r
depletion. This robustly implies a most massive black\r
hole below the pair instability gap of Mlow = 64 M\f with\r
an expected error of about 2 M\f. Pending further exper\u0002iments, we regard this as the upper limit to the black hole\r
mass one can obtain in a close mass exchanging binary\r
by adjusting only the nuclear reaction rates. Additional\r
corrections for mass loss are small (Table 3 vs. Table 1).\r
3. SINGLE STARS\r
More massive black holes can result from presupernova\r
stars that retain their hydrogen envelope. It is assumed\r
that the envelope participates, along with the helium\r
core in the collapse to a black hole. Very massive sin\u0002gle stars could die with most of their envelope intact\r
if their metallicity is small enough that their mass loss\r
is negligible. The envelope might also be retained in a\r
wide detached binary systems. Both assumptions have\r
their problems. Even if radiative driven winds retain\r
their proposed scalings for the very high masses and low\r
metallicities where they have not been tested experimen\u0002tally, stars near the Eddington limit may find other ways\r
of losing mass. The mass loss rates for luminous blue\r
variables and stars as massive as Eta Carina are very\r
uncertain, and might not diminish greatly just because\r
the radiative opacity is less (Smith & Owocki 2006). Bi\u0002nary systems so wide as to contain supergiants may also\r
have difficulty merging by gravitational radiation in a\r
Hubble time.\r
Still, it is interesting that the larger carbon abundances

Note. — The model name gives the zero age main sequence mass of the\r

surface convection zone. The external binding energy there is close to 1048 erg.\r
MHe is the helium core mass and MpreSN, the total presupernova mass. All\r
quantities except the remnant mass, MBH, and final kinetic energy, KEexp, are\r
evaluated at carbon ignition.\r
allowed by altered reaction rates also imply that single\r
stars with larger total mass could collapse. Belczynski\r
et al. (2010) estimated a maximum black hole mass of\r
80 M\f for a metallicity 1 % of solar, but did not include\r
the effect of the pair instability. Woosley (2017) found\r
that a black hole of 65 M\f resulted from the evolution\r
of a 70 M\f star with a a very low mass loss rate (Model\r
T70C). That calculation was for a relatively large rate for\r
12C(α, γ)16O (fBuch = 1.2) and a standard value for 3α.\r
Whereas not attempting a full survey, we consider here\r
the evolution of six metal-deficient massive stars, Mod\u0002els T90C, T100C, T110C, T120C, T130C, and T140C\r
(see Table 2 Woosley 2017), using variations on the reac\u0002tion rates chosen to produce large central carbon abun\u0002dances at helium depletion. These models did not rotate\r
and had zero age main sequence masses of 90 to 140 M\f.\r
Their metallicity was 10% solar, but their mass loss rate\r
as main sequence stars and red supergiants was further\r
reduced by an additional factor of 8 compared to the\r
standard value for that metallicity. This would require\r
a still lower value of metallicity or mass loss rates much\r
less than standard values for 10 % solar metallicity.\r
Final presupernova masses, helium core masses, and\r
remnant masses are given in Table 5 along with the vari\u0002ations in reaction rates and resulting carbon mass frac\u0002tion at helium depletion. The behavior of these full star\r
explosions generally follows from Table 1 and Table 4,\r
but due to the non-negligible boundary pressure of the\r
hydrogen shell, the equivalent helium core mass in Ta\u0002ble 5 is smaller than for the bare helium star models.\r
Given their large carbon mass fractions, the pair insta\u0002bility in Models T90Ca and T100Cb is mild and launches\r
weak shocks having initial speeds of only 100’s of km s−1.\r
These shocks appear late in the evolution after stable

8\r
central oxygen burning and most of silicon core burning\r
have already transpired. Typical explosion energies were\r
1047 erg or less. This only suffices to eject a small amount\r
of material near the surface, even in a red supergiant, so\r
the remnant mass very nearly equals the presupernova\r
mass.\r
Other models experienced stronger pulsations, though\r
still late in their evolution. The presupernova models\r
were all characterized by large radii, >∼1014 cm, but had\r
surface convection zones that had not dredged up the\r
entire envelope. The net binding energy of the dredged\r
up material for all six stars was, to within about a fac\u0002tor of two, ∼ 1048 erg, while the binding of all matter\r
external to the helium core, including the part that was\r
not convective, was greater that ∼ 1050 erg. Thus when\r
explosions developed with energy of order 1049 erg, typ\u0002ical mass separations lay beneath, but not far beneath\r
the base of the convective part of the envelope (Models\r
110Cb and 120Cb). These mass separations were difficult\r
to determine because shock speeds were so slow that fall\u0002back continued for decades following the initial collapse.\r
The location of the base of the convective zone is also\r
model dependent since it is sensitive to the convection\r
model, the opacity and metallicity, and mass loss. The\r
depth of this zone was also slightly different at helium de\u0002pletion, carbon ignition (where the evaluations in Table 5\r
were made), and carbon depletion. Had the model been\r
a luminous blue variable or blue supergiant, the binding\r
of the envelope might have been greater and so would\r
the remnant mass, but then mass loss for the luminous\r
blue variable could have been large. For larger explosion\r
energies (Models 100Ca, 130Cb and 140Cb) the mass\r
cut is more precisely determined. For all models except\r
T140Cb, the pulses occurred so late that the iron core\r
collapsed while the outgoing shock from the pulses was\r
still inside the star.\r
For the small values of 12C(α, γ)\r
16O rate and large 3α,\r
black holes of 85 M\f and more are possible. These are\r
cases where the advanced stages of evolution are essen\u0002tially stable and pulsational mass loss is negligible (Mod\u0002els T90Ca and 100Cb). Since the helium core properties\r
are largely independent of the mass loss rate, unless the\r
whole envelope is lost, somewhat larger black hole masses\r
could be achieved given ones tolerance for reducing the\r
mass loss rate, but probably not much beyond 100 M\f.\r
It is interesting that black holes of such high mass can\r
form, even in isolation. If they were to some day be cap\u0002tured in another system, one would not need to resort to\r
multiple mergers to build up a black hole of 85 M\f.\r
As noted before, there might be problems with mak\u0002ing a LIGO source directly this way. Given the large\r
radii of the stars, bringing the resulting black hole from\r
the first explosion close enough to the secondary in order\r
to merge in a Hubble time requires additional assump\u0002tions. One possibility is that the primary (which makes\r
the more massive black hole) was a blue supergiant or lu\u0002minous blue variable and the secondary a red supergiant\r
when they died. The larger radius for the secondary\r
might provoke mass exchange that was avoided for the\r
primary. This might happen e.g., if the secondary was\r
a low metallicity star that made primary nitrogen when\r
its helium convective core encroached on the hydrogen\r
envelope while the primary did not. Such evolution is\r
often seen for stars of this large mass and low metallicity\r
(e.g., Heger & Woosley 2010).\r
Another possibility is kicks during the explosion (Tu\u0002tukov & Cherepashchuk 2017). The difficulty here is that\r
if no mass is ejected in a jet, the kick must be a conse\u0002quence of asymmetric neutrino emission, but neutrino\r
losses are a small fraction of the stellar mass. Once a\r
black hole forms, without rapid rotation, the infalling\r
material does not radiate neutrinos effectively. If neu\u0002trino emission is restricted to just the phase of proto\u0002neutron star evolution, then the losses are probably no\r
more than 0.5 M\f c\r
2\r
. Given a 5 % asymmetry, which\r
seems liberal, the kick for an 80 M\f black hole would\r
then be (0.5)(0.05)/80 c ∼ 100 km s−1. These neutrinos\r
would need to be coincidentally radiated largely in the\r
direction of orbital motion. This could cancel the or\u0002bital momentum for a wide enough separation, but the\r
balance would need to be nearly precise to result in a\r
plunging highly eccentric orbit that might later be circu\u0002larized if it passed close enough to the secondary. This\r
seems feasible but unlikely.\r
4. ROTATION\r
4.1. Formalism and Physics\r
Rotation weakens the pair instability (Fowler & Hoyle\r
1964), but the effect on the dynamics of the explosion\r
is not great unless the star maintains a large degree of\r
differential rotation. Marchant & Moriya (2020) give the\r
modification to the structural adiabatic index, Γ1, re\u0002quired for instability,\r

where ωk = Ω/\r
p\r

e\r
is the ratio of the actual angu\u0002lar rotation rate, Ω, to the Keplerian rotation rate for\r
a given mass shell; re is its equatorial radius, here just\r
taken to be the radius; and m is the mass inside that\r
radius. Since a real star has neither constant Γ1 or ωk,\r
this criterion may or may not be satisfied in different\r
regions of the star at different times. Whether there is\r
a global instability depends upon the integrated average\r
(Marchant & Moriya 2020).\r
The strength of the pair instability also depends sen\u0002sitively upon the temperature and is weaker when the\r
star first begins to contract and gain momentum, and\r
greater at the end when oxygen burns explosively. The\r
accumulated momentum during the collapse plays an im\u0002portant dynamical role. Typical maximum decrements\r
in Γ1 from the pair instability for the masses being stud\u0002ied, once the central temperature exceeds 2 × 109 K, are\r
a few percent locally (relative to a fiducial 1.33), and\r
∼1 % globally (Fig. 1). This implies that differential\r
rotation in the deep interior with ωk\r
>∼ 10 % will be re\u0002quired to alleviate the instability. Smaller amounts of\r
rotation can still affect the outcome though by leverag\u0002ing the evolution early on when the instability is weak.\r
Marchant & Moriya (2020) found a typical increase in\r
black hole mass of ∼4 % when magnetic torques (Spruit\r
2002) were included in the models, and ∼15 % when they\r
were not. Since ignoring magnetic torques would give a\r
very rapid rotation rate for pulsars and possibly over\u0002produce gamma-ray bursts (Woosley & Heger 2006), the\r
inclusion of magnetic torques is probably more realistic.\r
Unfortunately, rapid rotation affects the evolution of

9\r
massive stars in many ways, and disentangling them com\u0002plicates any conclusion regarding the black hole birth\r
function. Rotation leads to mixing that results, at a\r
minimum, in larger helium cores for a given main se\u0002quence mass. At a maximum, the star may become fully\r
mixed on the main sequence and experience chemically\u0002homogeneous evolution (Maeder 1987). Rotationally\u0002induced mixing can transport additional helium into the\r
convective helium burning core at late times, thus de\u0002creasing the carbon yield and lowering the remnant mass\r
(Table 4). Rotation reduces the central density mak\u0002ing the star evolve like one of lower mass (Marchant &\r
Moriya 2020). Rapid rotation can lead to mass shedding\r
at the equator, especially in stars that are already near\r
the Eddington limit - as these are. Rotation can mix he\u0002lium or carbon down during the implosion so that shell\r
burning has a greater effect during the first pulse. Ro\u0002tation can alter the way the collapsing iron core behaves\r
and allow explosions to develop where the star would\r
have collapsed if neutrino transport were the only mech\u0002anism. If the rotation of the remnant is too rapid, not\r
all of the star can immediately collapse to a black hole\r
without making a disk. The formation of a “collapsar”\r
may produce a jet that explodes the remaining star or,\r
at the least, inhibits its full collapse.\r
The amount and distribution of angular momentum\r
also depends critically upon uncertain mechanisms for\r
its transport and the rates for mass loss. Transport con\u0002centrates angular momentum in the outer layers of the\r
star where mass loss removes it. To neglect mass loss\r
is to overestimate the role of rotation in the evolution,\r
but to include it adds another uncertain parameter to the\r
outcome, a parameter that will itself vary in an uncertain\r
way with metallicity.\r
For all these reasons, the results in this section are\r
less precise than those in the previous ones. A one\u0002dimensional code is used to calculate the effects of a\r
two-dimensional phenomenon - rotation. Angle averag\u0002ing and a semi-empirical formulation is necessary. Mass\r
loss by winds is neglected, though see §4.3. What is\r
most important is the angular momentum distribution\r
the star has at carbon ignition since radiation-driven\r
mass loss can presumably can be neglected after that.\r
Though we follow all stars through helium burning, they\r
approach carbon ignition with essentially the same an\u0002gular momentum distribution they started with - nearly\r
rigid rotation characterized by a single parameter, Jinit,\r
the initial total angular momentum of the star.\r
Rotational mixing and angular momentum transport\r
by the usual dynamical processes (Heger et al. 2000) were\r
included in all stages of the evolution, including the inter\u0002pulse periods. Time-dependent convection is also left on\r
during inter-pulse periods in that portion of the star that\r
remains in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e., is not moving su\u0002personically. Except where specified, angular momentum\r
transport by magnetic torques is included (Spruit 2002;\r
Heger et al. 2005).\r
Unlike our past studies of pair instability, an approx\u0002imate centrifugal support term has been added to the\r
momentum equation as\r

2\r

3\r

Ω\r
2\r
r\r
(2)\r
where j is the average specific angular momentum of the\r
shell, r is the radius of the shell, and Ω is the angular\r
velocity of the shell. Shells are assumed to be spherical\r
and rigidly rotating (solid body rotation for each shells).\r
Different shells may rotate at different angular velocity.\r
The factor 9/4 is because, for a spherical shell in solid ro\u0002tation, the average angular momentum at the equator is\r
3/2 times the average. The factor f accounts for averag\u0002ing the centrifugal force over the surface, and should be\r
2/3. Our approximation does not take into account any\r
deformation of the shell or that the centrifugal forces\r
would be larger at the equator than at the pole.\r
The helium stars studied here are assumed to initially\r
rotate rigidly and are characterized by a total angular\r
momentum, Jinit = 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 × 1053 erg s.\r
Several choices of reaction rates are explored. Except for\r
rotation, the physics and computational procedure here\r
are the same as for non-rotating helium stars in §2.3.\r
Rotational mass shedding is included and is important\r
for many models with Jinit >∼ 6 × 1052 erg s. A surface\r
zone is assumed to be lost when its angular velocity ex\u0002ceeds 50 % of Keplerian (i.e., ωk > 0.5). This value,\r
corresponding to a ratio of centrifugal force to gravity\r
of 25 %, is an upper bound since the luminosity of the\r
stars considered here is typically ∼ 90 % Eddington. In\r
any case, a larger value would make the approximation\r
of spherical stars highly questionable. Values of ωk this\r
large only exist in layers near the surface. The central\r
density rises from around 1,000 g cm−3 prior to carbon\r
ignition (T9,c = 0.5) to 107 g cm−3 during silicon burn\u0002ing. As the star attempts to maintain rigid rotation, the\r
surface of the star is spun up, resulting in mass loss. This\r
loss continues all the way through the evolution.\r
In addition to their angular momentum and mass, the\r
models in Table 6 are characterized by several choices of\r
nuclear reaction rates chosen to span most of the range\r
for the non-rotating stars in §2.3 and Table 1. Three\r
choices typify a central carbon mass fraction at carbon\r
ignition, X(12C), that is either “small”, fBuch = 1.2,\r
f3α = 1; “medium”, fBuch = 1.0, f3α = 1.35; or “large”,\r
fBuch = 0.75, f3α = 1.35. Magnetic torques are included\r
all the time in all models except 64b, 66b, 68b, and 80b.\r
The rotating models in Table 6 will be denoted by their\r
mass and the choice of reaction rates and angular mo\u0002mentum used in their calculation. Model 601.2,12 thus\r
refers to the 60 M\f model that used fBuch = 1.2, f3α = 1,\r
and an initial angular momentum Jinit = 12 × 1052 erg s.\r
4.2. Results for Rotating Helium Stars\r
Model stars (Table 6) were generated by allowing an\r
extended configuration of pure helium with an initial\r
central density of 0.1 g cm−3to relax to thermal and\r
hydrostatic equilibrium with a central density of about\r
200 g cm−3 and central temperature ∼ 2.2 × 108 K where\r
helium burning ignited. The initial angular momen\u0002tum, Jinit, characterizes that state. Helium burning lasts\r
about 300,000 years in all models and produces the cen\u0002tral carbon mass fractions given in the table. Typical\r
radii at central helium depletion (helium mass fraction\r
is 1%) are near 1.5 × 1011 cm and the luminosities are\r
∼ 1.05 × 1040 erg s−1(M / 60 M\f).\r
After helium depletion, carbon burns away at the cen\u0002ters of all models without the nuclear energy genera-

perience rotational mass shedding. This begins late in\r
helium burning, but mostly happens near and just after\r
carbon ignition. The mass lost is <∼2 M\f, which is a small\r
fraction of the total mass, but often contains a substan\u0002tial fraction of the total angular momentum. For exam\u0002ple, Model 601.2,12 shrank to 59.04 M\f at carbon ignition\r
and, in the process, its angular momentum, J52, declined\r
to from 12 to 7.84. By oxygen ignition, these values\r
had further decreased to 58.05 M\f and 6.35, respectively.\r
Even before pulsations began, the initial angular momen\u0002tum for Model 601.2,12 had almost halved, making Model\r
581.2,6 and Model 601.2,12 similar in outcome. The two\r
stars had masses of 57.6 and 58.0 M\f after rotational

Note. — See Table 1 for the definition of fBuch. Jinit is the initial total angular of the helium star. It\r
can only decrease due to mass loss, though angular momentum can be transported within the star. X(\r
12C)\r
is the central carbon mass fraction just before central carbon burning ignites. Mshed is the mass shed by\r
rotation up to the point when oxygen burning ignites. Mpulse1 and KEpulse1 are the mass following the\r
first pulse and the kinetic energy of the initial ejecta. A zero value for KEpulse1 indicates stable oxygen\r
ignition with no explosive mass loss. MBH and KEfin are the mass of the black hole remnant and the\r
total kinetic energy of all ejecta including the first pulse. Jfin is the angular momentum of the black\r
hole remnant. Models 64b, 66b, 68b, and 80b were calculated without including the transport of angular\r
momentum by magnetic torques and are of questionable validity. Otherwise, the most massive black hole\r
for each choice of reaction rates and angular momentum is given in boldface. Black hole masses for models\r
with Jfinal >∼(MBH/33.5M\f)\r
2 are upper bounds. The Kerr parameter is the ratio of these two quantities.

12\r
mass shedding and produced black holes of 48.6 M\f and\r
48.5 M\f. Other pairs, like 621.2,6 and 641.2,12 did not\r
yield such similar results because of the stochastic na\u0002ture of multiple pulses and sensitivity to slight changes\r
in the angular momentum distribution and composition.\r
The agreement was especially poor for models near the\r
threshold of full explosion like 661.2,6 and 681.2,12, and\r
for models with little rotational mass shedding.\r
Still, the implication is that it would not be fruitful\r
to consider models with much larger rotation rates than\r
Jinit,52 = 12. The excess momentum would simply be\r
shed early in the evolution and the maximum black hole\r
mass would not be greatly increased. This is particularly\r
true since the criterion for rotational mass loss, ωk = 0.5\r
at the surface, is already too large for stars so near the\r
Eddington limit.\r
Also shown in Table 6 is the energy of the first pulse\r
and the mass of the star after that pulse (including the\r
effects of rotational mass shedding prior to the pulse).\r
These characteristics follow expectations more consis\u0002tently than final properies. For a given angular momen\u0002tum, the mass ejected and the kinetic energy of that\r
mass, KEpulse1 increase with initial mass. For a given\r
initial mass, Mpulse1 increases with initial angular mo\u0002mentum, while KEpulse1 decreases. In cases where the\r
central carbon mass fraction and initial angular momen\u0002tum are high, the stars often ignite central oxygen burn\u0002ing stably. Such stas may also experience a long phase of\r
numerous, weak pulsations due to the burning of carbon\r
in a shell. The mass lost prior to oxygen burning in such\r
models is small though.\r
A strong first pulse on the other hand implies a long\r
wait before the next pulse while the star relaxes from a\r
highly extended, weakly bound state. During this time,\r
angular momentum can be transported out of the core by\r
shear, magnetic torques, and convection. For these cases,\r
subsequent pulses are not so influenced by rotation as the\r
first one and can also be quite strong.\r
Indeed, the transport of angular momentum by mag\u0002netic torques prior to oxygen ignition and during the\r
long interpulse periods, when they exist, is a major un\u0002certainty in these calculations. Eliminating them re\u0002duces rotational mass shedding. Angular momentum\r
that might have been transported to the surface and\r
lost remains concentrated in the central core where it\r
influences the subsequent evolution. Fig. 2 shows the\r
evolution of the angular velocity and the ratio of the an\u0002gular velocity to Keplerian, ωk, for Model 661.2,12 with\r
and without magnetic torques (models in Table 6 that\r
end in b, like “66b” did not include magnetic torques).\r
Early on, near carbon ignition at T9 = 0.5, the rota\u0002tional profiles are similar for the two models, though\r
rotational mass shedding has already reduced the angu\u0002lar momentum in the model without magnetic fields. As\r
time passes, the divergence increases and by the time the\r
iron core collapses, there is more than an order of magni\u0002tude difference in the angular momenta of the remnants.\r
The chief cause of divergence in this case is magnetic\r
braking during the thousand year long interval following\r
the second pulse in the model that includes magnetic\r
fields. During that time, the angular momentum in the\r
inner 55.5 M\f of the star (the part destined to be a black\r
hole) declines from 4.2×1052 erg s to 5.4×1051 erg s. The\r
mass of the star is constant during this interval so the\r
excess angular momentum piles up in a mass of just a few\r
M\f near the surface. This is later ejected in a final third\r
pulse so that the star that included magnetic fields ends\r
up making a black hole with spin J52 = 0.53 whereas the\r
one without magnetic fields makes a black hole of nearly\r
the same mass, but with J52 = 6.86.\r
It would not be realistic to ignore magnetic torques\r
during these long Kelvin-Helmholtz episodes while cores\r
recover from prior explosive expansion. The composi\u0002tions, densities. temperatures and rotation rates are sim\u0002ilar to those in stable carbon burning. On the other hand,\r
experimental validation of the simple prescription used\r
is lacking. The correct solution might lie between the\r
two extremes. This means that any estimate of the Kerr\r
parameter for the black holes coming from these rapidly\r
rotating models, especially those with large carbon abun\u0002dance is not reliable.\r
The dimensionless Kerr Parameter is a/M =\r
cJ/GM2 = J52(33.5 M\f/M)\r
2\r
. For a 70 M\f black\r
hole with a/M = 1, the critical angular momentum is\r
4.40×1052 erg s. Compact remnants in Table 6 with much\r
more angular momentum than this cannot form black\r
holes without losing mass and shedding the excess. This\r
includes many of the more massive models with large\r
carbon mass fractions in Table 6. Only a small fraction\r
of this angular momentum is in the collapsing iron core\r
itself. Most is in the outer layers. The most likely fate\r
of such cores is to form a black hole surrounded by an\r
accretion disk. This probably leads to the production\r
of jets (Woosley 1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999) and\r
mass ejection. That is, these are excellent candidates for\r
making long soft gamma-ray bursts, and GRBs may be\r
intimately related to the formation of the most massive\r
LIGO sources (see also Marchant & Moriya 2020). The\r
bursts, of course, happened long ago when the black holes\r
formed, not when they merged. They are probably not\r
the most common form of GRBs since they involve quite\r
massive black holes and the surface layers of the star.\r
Given the large angular momentum, the disk might form\r
at large radius and thus have a long characteristic time\r
scale. A time scale of minutes is implied by the free fall\r
time for the outer layers and not an unreasonable esti\u0002mate for the burst duration.\r
How much mass is ejected? Most of the final angular\r
momentum is in the outer part of the remnant (Fig. 2).\r
Consider the case of 760.75/1.35,12. This model leaves a\r
73.3 M\f remnant with Jfinal,52 = 8.62, too much angular\r
momentum for a black hole with this mass. But J52 = 4.2\r
exists at 69 M\f corresponding to a/M = 1. A probable\r
outcome then is that a black hole with an initial mass\r
∼69 M\f forms with an accretion disk of about 4 M\f.\r
Jet formation will eject some, but not all of this 4 M\f.\r
Based on calculations by Zhang et al. (2004), the frac\u0002tion ejected might not be large. It depends on the effi\u0002ciency with which lateral shocks induced by the jet eject\r
matter in the equatorial plane. The impication is that\r
some of the large black hole masses in Table 6 should\r
be treated as upper bounds, but are perhaps not too far\r
from correct. The final black hole of all models with\r
J52 >∼(M/33.5 M\f)\r
2 would have a dimensionless Kerr pa\u0002rameter near a/M = 1.\r
The maximum mass black hole for a given choice of

13\r
reaction rates and angular momentum is given in bold\u0002face in Table 6. Models without magnetic torques are\r
ignored. These limits range from little modification to\r
the those derived for non-rotating stars in Table 1 if\r
Jinit,52 <∼3, to increases as great as 11 % for maximal ro\u0002tation. Our heaviest black hole is 73 M\f (though, as\r
previously noted, that model has too much spin to fully\r
collapse to a black hole). This is a larger increase than\r
estimated by Marchant & Moriya (2020) for stars with\r
magnetic torques included. The difference probably in\u0002volves the consideration here of more rapid rotation and,\r
especially, choices of reaction rates that produce more\r
carbon. Without magnetic fields the increase could po\u0002tentially be greater, though probably not much larger as\r
Model 80b illustrates.\r
4.3. Progenitor Evolution\r
The rotation rates assumed here are similar to those\r
used to model GRB progenitors (Woosley & Heger 2006;\r
Yoon & Langer 2005; Yoon et al. 2006; Cantiello et al.\r
2007). Chemically homogeneous evolution is common for\r
these stars, and is consistent with the need to keep LIGO\r
progenitors compact inside close binaries (Mandel & de\r
Mink 2016).\r
Consider a 70 M\f main sequence star with initial angu\u0002lar momentum J = 4×1053 erg s. This corresponds to an\r
equatorial rotational speed at the surface of 390 km s−1\r
and an angular velocity there that is 32 % Keplerian.\r
With this rotation rate, the star evolves chemically ho\u0002mogeneously (Mandel & de Mink 2016). It never be\u0002comes a giant and consumes all the hydrogen within its\r
mass, except for a small fraction near the surface, while\r
still on the main sequence. It thus evolves directly into a\r
helium star similar to the ones considered in this section.\r
If mass loss were negligible, this initial angular mo\u0002mentum would be preserved and the star would die with\r
values in excess of the largest ones in Table 6, but that is\r
not realistic. On the other hand, with solar metallicity\r
and conventional mass loss rates, the star would end up\r
with too small a mass to encounter the pair instability\r
and would have a negligible amount of angular momen\u0002tum.\r
Consider then the results of substantially decreasing\r
the star’s mass loss rate, perhaps due to a small ini\u0002tial metallicity. Following Sz´ecsi et al. (2015), we con\u0002sider a metallicity of 2 % solar, more specifically an\r
iron mass fraction of 2.92 × 10−5. Their 67 M\f model\r
had a rotational velocity of 400 km s−1, comparable to\r
the 390 km s−1for our 70 M\f model. Their model also\r
evolved chemically homogeneously. For the mass loss\r
prescription they employed, their star had a mass at the\r
end of hydrogen burning of 62.2 M\f. Most of their mass\r
loss occurred after the star became a Wolf-Rayet star\r
with a surface hydrogen mass fraction less than 0.3.\r
Sz´ecsi et al. (2015) used a complicated prescription for\r
mass loss involving multiple sources and interpolation.\r
Here we just use the rates of Nieuwenhuijzen & de Jager\r
(1990) and Yoon (2017) with a multiplicative factor less\r
than one for the Yoon rate. Given the uncertain weak\r
dependence of Yoon’s mass loss rate on metallicity, these\r
reductions are reasonable. With this prescription, our\r
70 M\f metal-poor star reaches a central hydrogen mass\r
fraction of 0.3 with a mass of 69.4 M\f. Up to that\r
point mass loss was taken from Nieuwenhuijzen & de\r
Jager (1990) and was small. Continued evolution used\r
the Yoon rates with a multiplicative factor 0.5. The star\r
finished hydrogen burning with a mass of 63.7 M\f and\r
a residual angular momentum of 2.3 × 1053 erg s. The\r
model of Sz´ecsi et al. (2015) had a luminosity at hydro\u0002gen depletion of 106.34 L\f and an effective temperature\r
of 80,600 K. Our values were 106.37 L\f and 86,800 K. The\r
slight mismatch in starting mass and rotation rate is in\u0002consequential compared with uncertainties in the mass\r
loss rate.\r
It is necessary to follow the continued evolution\r
through helium burning. Published mass loss rates for\r
metal-poor helium stars span a wide range (Vink 2017;\r
Yoon 2017; Sander et al. 2019; Sander & Vink 2020;\r
Woosley et al. 2020). Here we continued to use the rate of\r
Yoon (2017) scaled, for the given metallicity (2 % solar),\r
by factors of 1, 0.5, and 0.25. All runs were started from\r
the model with central hydrogen mass fraction 0.3. These\r
multipliers gave a range of average mass loss rates during\r
helium burning from 4×10−5 M\f y\r
−1\r
to 1×10−5 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
The instantaneous rate was about a factor of two smaller\r
early in helium burning when the star was still a WNE\r
star and larger later on when it is a WC star. These\r
rates are consistent with what Sander & Vink (2020)\r
have recently published for a metallicity of 2 % to 5 %\r
solar. With these three rates, the final mass of the WC\r
stars at carbon ignition were 47.2, 56.7, and 62.7 M\f and\r
their angular momenta were 2.7, 9.7, and 19 × 1052 erg s.\r
This spans most of the range of angular momenta sam\u0002pled in Table 6. Other choices of initial mass and angular\r
momentum could have filled the grid.\r
5. SUPER-EDDINGTON ACCRETION\r
Another source of uncertainty affecting black hole\r
masses in a close binary system is the subsequent interac\u0002tion of the first black hole born with the other star (van\r
Son et al. 2020). It is well known that a black hole can ac\u0002crete at a rate well above the Eddington limit. Accretion\r
rates of solar masses per second are not uncommon dur\u0002ing core collapse simulations in failed supernovae. The\r
excess energy that might have inhibited infall or pow\u0002ered mass outflow is either radiated away as neutrinos\r
or advected into the event horizon and lost (Popham et\r
al. 1999). A less extreme and more relevant example\r
is Model r003 of Sadowski & Narayan (2016). In their\r
3D general relativistic MHD simulation, a 10 M\f black\r
hole accretes at 176 times the Eddington value, that is\r
at at rate 6.7 × 10−6 M\f y\r
−1\r
. The authors note that the\r
calculations should scale for larger mass black holes and\r
that greater super-Eddington factors are allowed. For\r
an 80 M\f black hole, Model r003 would correspond to\r
an accretion rate of about 5 × 10−5 M\f y\r
−1\r
. We specu\u0002late that similar flows and characteristics would charac\u0002terize accretion rates on up to 0.001 M\f y\r
−1\r
. Sadowski\r
& Narayan (2016) note that a portion of the accreted\r
energy, about 3 % M c ˙ 2, would go into powering semi\u0002relativistic polar outflows. Black holes undergoing this\r
sort of accretion might thus appear as ultra-luminous\r
x-ray sources or SS433 analogues. Indeed, an accre\u0002tion rate of 10−4 M\f y\r
−1 has been inferred for SS 433\r
(Cherepashchuk et al. 2020). Hyper-Eddington accretion\r
factors of up to 1,000 have been computed for supermas\u0002sive black holes including the effects of the outgoing jet\r
on the disk (Takeo et al. 2020).

14\r
It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider the full\r
complexity of a mass exchanging binary, especially those\r
that might experience common envelope evolution, but\r
our single star models offer some insights. The progen\u0002itors of the more massive LIGO sources were probably\r
stars of ∼ 150 M\f or more and possibly formed in metal\r
deficient regions. One or more stages of common enve\u0002lope evolution are frequently invoked. The accretion by\r
a black hole during a dynamic common envelope phase\r
is currently thought to be small (De et al. 2020), but the\r
evolution leading up to that common envelope is poorly\r
explored for stars of such great masses.\r
We consider here a 130 M\f star finishing its hydrogen\r
burning evolution in a close binary with a black hole of\r
∼ 60 M\f with an initial orbital separation of 300 R\f, or\r
about 2 × 1013 cm. Such a configuration is reasonable\r
for the progenitors of LIGO sources (Bogomazov et al.\r
2018). The initial black hole mass is reasonable for the\r
range of reaction rates and rotation rates considered in\r
this paper. We further assume that the star has 10 %\r
solar metallicity. Its mass after hydrogen burning is thus\r
about 116 M\f (Woosley 2017; Model T130). In the ini\u0002tial configuration the period of the binary is 40 days.\r
The radius of the main sequence star is ∼ 1.5 − 2 R\f\r
throughout hydrogen burning. The main sequence star\r
does not yet fill its Roche lobe.\r
The situation changes as the star completes hydrogen\r
burning, contracts in its center to ignite helium burning,\r
and attempts to become a supergiant. The star devel\u0002ops a surface convective zone that gradually eats into\r
its hydrogen envelope. The rate at which the convec\u0002tive zone moves into the envelope, which is also the time\r
to transition to a supergiant, depends on the theory of\r
semi-convection, but is of order a nuclear time scale, or\r
∼ 105 yr for helium burning. The Kelvin-Helmholtz time\r
scale for the envelope is smaller, a few thousand years. If\r
the envelope were to be lost on either time scale, the loss\r
rate would thus correspond to 0.0002 to 0.002 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
Until close to the end, most of the envelope, by mass, re\u0002mains dense transports radiation by diffusion except for\r
a region just above the hydrogen burning shell.\r
We explored the effect of imposing a limit on the ra\u0002dius of this 116 M\f secondary at 2 × 1013 cm, i.e., man\u0002ually removing all mass beyond this radius as the star\r
attempted to become a giant. A steady state was found\r
with a surface convective zone that had an outer bound\u0002ary that extended nearly to the cut-off radius. The base\r
of this convective shell remained fixed at ∼ 7 × 1012 cm\r
as mass was removed from the top and new matter con\u0002vectively dredged up from the bottom. At any time, this\r
convective shell contained only a few hundredths of a so\u0002lar mass with density ranging from 10−11 g cm−3 at the\r
surface to 10−8 g cm−1 at its base. The binding energy\r
of this convective shell, ∼ 1046 erg, was very small com\u0002pared with the orbital kinetic energy of the black hole,\r
∼ 1050 erg. The Roche radius was inside of this convec\u0002tive envelope, close to its base, but the angular velocity\r
of the black hole within this envelope was supersonic, so\r
stable Roche lobe overflow seems unlikely.\r
Rather we speculate that the friction resulting from\r
the black holes motion drives mass loss from the sec\u0002ondary. Podsiadlowski (2001) has discussed such “fric\u0002tionally driven winds”. If the convective layer is removed,\r
the friction is reduced so the mass loss might be self reg\u0002ulated and determined by the rate at which convection\r
moves into the envelope. We followed our toy model for\r
100 years (about 10,000 steps) , during which the mass\r
loss and convective shell properties remained in steady\r
state. The inferred mass loss rate was 0.0018 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
This is a common envelope evolution of sorts, but one\r
that proceeds on a thermal time scale, not a dynamical\r
one (Podsiadlowski 2001). The efficiency for the black\r
hole to retain the mass that is lost by the secondary is\r
unknown, but a total envelope mass of 60 M\f could be\r
lost this way. Growth of the hole by 15 M\f or more\r
(half of the envelope lost to a wind and half that ac\u0002creted) does not seem unreasonable (see also van Son et\r
al. 2020). Over time, the black hole gains mass and, ini\u0002tially at least, moves closer to the secondary. It could be\r
that eventually the interaction becomes stronger as the\r
orbit is narrowed and a more dynamical sort of common\r
envelope evolution occurs. The 60 M\f helium core of the\r
secondary eventually experiences its own pair instability,\r
making a black hole not much smaller than 60 M\f and, if\r
the black holes have become close enough, owing to the\r
action of common envelope evolution jets, or kicks, they\r
merge on a Hubble time. This is clearly a very uncertain\r
and possibly quite rare model.\r
6. DISCUSSION\r
Four modifications to the assumptions previously used\r
to calculate the “pair-gap” in the black hole birth func\u0002tion have been explored. Each has been suggested pre\u0002viously and has the potential to substantially alter the\r
boundaries, but each also has its problems. In general, it\r
is not too difficult to raise the lower bound of the cut off,\r
Mlow, from 46 M\f (Woosley 2019) to about 60 or even\r
70 M\f, but raising it to 85 M\f and more is difficult and\r
might require either that the very massive black hole\r
was captured, i.e., not born in the binary that subse\u0002quently merged, or other special circumstances. That is,\r
pending better determination of uncertain reaction rates,\r
the events in the GWTC-2 catalog (Abbott et al. 2020)\r
might be accounted for with rather standard physics in\r
which there is still a pair gap with Mlow ∼ 60 M\f, but\r
GW190251 requires an alternate explanation. Two pos\u0002sible explanations were discussed here - birth in a de\u0002tached binary (§3) and super-Eddington accretion after\r
black hole birth (§5). See also Tutukov & Cherepashchuk\r
(2017) and van Son et al. (2020).\r
The combination of 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α rates used\r
in our previous studies may have conspired to produce\r
a small value for Mlow. Using the favored value for\r
12C(α, γ)16O from deBoer et al. (2017), 140 keV b for the\r
S-factor, gives 48 M\f (Table 1 with fBuch = 1.0 corre\u0002sponds to S = 146 keV b). If one accepts a major revision\r
to the 3α rate (Kib´edi et al. 2020; Eriksen et al. 2020)\r
but does not change 12C(α, γ)\r
16O, Mlow rises to 57 M\f.\r
Using the one-sigma lower bound from deBoer et al.\r
(2017) for the 12C(α, γ)\r
16O S-factor (i.e., S = 110 keV b)\r
and the revised 3α rate from Kib´edi et al. (2020) gives\r
Mlow = 64 M\f, which we presently regard as an upper\r
limit on the likely effects of rate modification alone. This\r
could be augmented by the effects of rotation and future\r
accretion by the black hole, but the direct collapse of an\r
85 M\f Wolf-Rayet star to a black hole (Belczynski 2020)\r
seems unlikely. Rate determinations are best left to the\r
nuclear laboratory, but using this large value of 3α and a

15\r
reduced value for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O may lead to difficulties in\r
stellar nucleosynthesis that have yet to be fully explored\r
(§2.2).\r
A larger range of reaction rates was considered by\r
Farmer et al. (2020), but within the range mutually con\u0002sidered, our results agree reasonably well with Farmer et\r
al. (2019) who gave an upper bound on Mlow of 56 M\f.\r
Due to sparse sampling and the cumulative effects of mul\u0002tiple pulses and burning shells, and based on examining\r
hundreds of models (not all included in the tables), all\r
values given here for Mlow probably have an uncertainty\r
of about ±2 M\f. A value of Mlow = 45 − 65 M\f is rea\u0002sonable for now given our current understanding of the\r
nuclear physics.\r
Similar rate modifications also imply a significant shift\r
in the upper boundary for the pair gap, Mhigh with values\r
ranging from 136 to 161 M\f. Even for our standard rates,\r
fBuch = 1.2 and f3α = 1, there is a significant shift of\r
Mhigh from 133.3 M\f (Heger & Woosley 2002) to 139 M\f\r
because of a better treatment of the nuclear burning and\r
a different treatment of convection during the implosion\r
(§2.3.2).\r
As has been known for some time, single stars that\r
retain part of their hydrogen envelopes when they die\r
can produce more massive black holes. The previous ap\u0002proximate limit for this mass was 65 M\f (Woosley 2017).\r
Here we have shown that the same adjustments to reac\u0002tion rates that raise Mlow and Mhigh for close binaries\r
will also raise the limit for single stars. Our estimate\r
for the maximum mass allowed by variation of reaction\r
rates within their current errors is about 90 M\f (Ta\u0002ble 5). This has several implications. If one can make\r
an 85 M\f black hole in an isolated star and later capture\r
it ina binary, then there only needs to be one stage of\r
capture, not two as would be required if the limit were\r
65 M\f (one to make the 85 M\f black hole and another\r
to make the final system). Second, the 85 M\f black hole\r
might be made in a detached binary, especially in a blue\r
supergiant or luminous blue variable. If the secondary\r
later became a red supergiant because of primary nitro\u0002gen production, the black hole and secondary might still\r
experience a common envelope phase and draw closer.\r
This might be a rare event.\r
Depending a number of uncertainties, rotation could\r
cause moderate to major modifications to Mlow (§4).\r
The maximum effect for our models that include mag\u0002netic torques are larger, by about a factor of two, than\r
those of Marchant & Moriya (2020), probably because we\r
considered a larger range of reaction rates and angular\r
momenta. Rapidly rotating stars that experience chem\u0002ically homogeneous evolution and lose less than 30 % of\r
their mass during hydrogen and helium burning can end\r
their lives with total angular momenta like those in Ta\u0002ble 6. The resulting black hole masses will be apprecia\u0002bly increased beyond those of non-rotating stars and the\r
lower bound on the pair-instability mass gap could be as\r
large as ∼ 70 M\f. Uncertainties include:\r
• The carbon abundance at the end of helium burn\u0002ing, hence the rates for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α.\r
• The initial angular momentum and the mass loss.\r
The initial angular momentum for the helium star\r
needs to be >∼3 × 1052 erg s to have a major effect.\r
This is reasonable for rapidly rotating stars experi\u0002encing chemically homogeneous evolution with low\r
mass loss rates(§4.3). Using current estimates in\r
the literature for mass loss rates, the maximum\r
metallicity would be between about 1 % and 5 %\r
solar.\r
• Rotational mass shedding. For an angular mo\u0002menta in excess of 6×1052 erg s, much of the excess\r
can be shed before the pair instability is encoun\u0002tered.\r
• Magnetic torques. These are particularly impor\u0002tant and uncertain during the long interpulse peri\u0002ods for events that have a strong first pulse. Too\r
many GRBs and rapidly rotating pulsars would ex\u0002ist if they were left out altogether, but their mag\u0002nitude is uncertain.\r
• Disk formation during the collapse. For those mod\u0002els with high carbon abundance, rapid initial ro\u0002tation, or weak magnetic torques, there may be\r
too much angular momentum for the entire pre\u0002supernova star to collapse to a black hole. Disk\r
formation and the accompanying disk winds and\r
jet-induced explosions may shed the excess angu\u0002lar momentum, but the amount of mass ejected is\r
uncertain. It might be small. If rotation is respon\u0002sible for the most massive black holes, the final\r
dimensionless Kerr parameter could be close to 1.\r
The effects of rotation on Mhigh were not explored but\r
might be smaller owing both to the stronger pair instabil\u0002ity in such massive stars and the likelihood of rotational\r
mass shedding in stars so near the Eddington limit.\r
Perhaps the most uncertain aspect of Mlow is the ac\u0002cretion the black hole experiences after it is born. This\r
might occur either during the common envelope phase\r
that is frequently invoked to bring the stars together or\r
during frictionally-induced mass loss by the secondary\r
after it finishes hydrogen burning. Here we focused on\r
the latter. As the secondary first expands beyond about\r
1013 cm the surface convective zone contains little mass.\r
Most of the envelope is radiative. If that small mass\r
spills over onto the black hole, it will be replenished on\r
a thermal time scale by the envelope. Envelope masses\r
may be ∼ 50 M\f and thermal time scales are thousands\r
of years so accretion rates of 10−3 − 10−2 M\f y\r
−1 might\r
occur. At such grossly super-Eddington rates the black\r
hole will accrete most of the matter, but also produce\r
strong bipolar outflows (Sadowski & Narayan 2016).\r

THE PAIR-INSTABILITY MASS GAP FOR BLACK HOLES\r
S. E. Woosley1 and Alexander Heger2-5\r
Draft version March 16, 2021\r
ABSTRACT\r
Stellar evolution theory predicts a “gap” in the black hole birth function caused by the pair in\u0002stability. Presupernova stars that have a core mass below some limiting value, Mlow, after all pul\u0002sational activity is finished, collapse to black holes, while more massive ones, up to some limiting\r
value, Mhigh, explode, promptly and completely, as pair-instability supernovae. Previous work has\r
suggested Mlow ≈ 50 M\f and Mhigh ≈ 130 M\f. These calculations have been challenged by recent\r
LIGO observations that show many black holes merging with individual masses, Mlow >∼ 65 M\f. Here\r
we explore four factors affecting the theoretical estimates for the boundaries of this mass gap: nuclear\r
reaction rates, evolution in detached binaries, rotation, and hyper-Eddington accretion after black\r
hole birth. Current uncertainties in reaction rates by themselves allow Mlow to rise to 64 M\f and\r
Mhigh as large as 161 M\f. Rapid rotation could further increase Mlow to ∼ 70 M\f, depending on the\r
treatment of magnetic torques. Evolution in detached binaries and super-Eddington accretion can,\r
with great uncertainty, increase Mlow still further. Dimensionless Kerr parameters close to unity are\r
allowed for the more massive black holes produced in close binaries, though they are generally smaller.\r

Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISN) and\r
pair-instability supernovae (PISN) are of interest because\r
of their potential roles in early stellar nucleosynthesis\r
(Heger & Woosley 2002), in explaining unusual types of\r
supernovae (Woosley et al. 2007), and as the progenitors\r
of massive black hole systems that can merge and pro\u0002duce detectable gravitational radiation signals (Woosley\r
2016). Of particular current interest is the prediction\r
of a “mass gap” between about 50 M\f (henceforth Mlow;\r
Woosley et al. 2007; Belczynski et al. 2016; Woosley 2017,\r
2019) and 130 M\f (Mhigh; Heger & Woosley 2002) where\r
very few black holes should exist in close binaries that\r
merge in a Hubble time.\r
The existence, or at least the boundaries of such a gap\r
have been challenged by the discovery of a single merging\r
black hole pair in which the more massive component had\r
a mass near 85 M\f (Abbott et al. 2020a,b), and, more re\u0002cently, by the publication of a catalog of sources (Abbott\r
et al. 2020) in which numerous black holes merging by\r
gravitational radiation have masses in the 60 to 70 M\f\r
range. Other recent theoretical papers have pointed out\r
the sensitivity of the boundaries of the putative mass\r
gap to uncertainties in reaction rates (Farmer et al. 2020;\r
Costa et al. 2020), the effects of rotation (Marchant &\r
Moriya 2020), and super-Eddington accretion (van Son et\r
al. 2020). These papers were submitted while the present"""

one was in preparation, and now take precedence. It re\u0002mains, useful, however to examine the role of this physics\r
using different sets of assumptions in a single code and to\r
attempt an evaluation of which of the causes is dominant.\r
Specifically we consider four possibilities for produc\u0002ing black hole remnants in close binaries with individual\r
masses substantially heavier than 50 M\f: 1) A decrease\r
in the rate for the 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and/or an increase in the\r
rate for the triple-alpha (3α) reaction (§2). The range\r
of rates considered is only what is currently favored by\r
experiment. Our choices might thus be regarded as con\u0002servative, but are influenced both by experiment and nu\u0002cleosynthetic considerations (§2.2). These changes alone\r
can potentially raise Mlow to 64 M\f, but are unlikely, by\r
themselves, to increase Mlow to 85 M\f. 2) Making the\r
black hole in a detached binary (§3). Using the variation\r
in rates discussed in §2, it is possible to produce black\r
holes of 100 M\f or more if the star’s hydrogen envelope is\r
retained at the time of core collapse. The obvious prob\u0002lems here are the low mass loss rate required and the\r
difficulty getting the two black holes together at the end,\r
if one of them was made in a supernova that was a giant\r
star when it exploded. 3) The effects of rapid rotation\r
(§4). The dynamical effects of rotation alone can only\r
increase Mlow modestly (Marchant & Moriya 2020), but\r
rotation coupled with uncertain reaction rates can raise\r
Mlow to ∼ 70 M\f. In the most extreme cases, the angu\u0002lar momentum in the presupernova star is too great to\r
form a black hole without the loss of angular momentum\r
and an uncertain amount of mass. 4) Super-Eddington\r
accretion after the first black hole has formed (§5). As\r
the secondary expands just following hydrogen depletion,\r
a stable phase of frictionally-driven mass loss (Podsiad\u0002lowski 2001) might substantially increase the mass of the\r
black hole produced by the primary. This involves some\r
very uncertain physics, but is the most likely way to pro\u0002duce black holes well over 70 M\f in a single close binary.\r
Our computational approach is the same as in Woosley\r

The pair-instability begins mildly, following the central\r
depletion of helium. As the star contracts towards car\u0002bon and, ultimately, oxygen ignition, more pairs are pro\u0002duced at the higher temperature required for burning and\r
the instability becomes stronger. Central carbon burning\r
is net endoergic in stars of this large mass, with the en\u0002ergy generation rate never exceeding neutrino losses, and\r
hence proceeding in a radiative fashion. Far enough out,\r
however, carbon shell burning becomes exoergic, even\r
in the face of neutrino losses, and can power convective\r
shells whose strength and extent affects the subsequent\r
dynamics of the implosion. Helium shell burning in the\r
outer layers of the star can have a similar, though usually\r
smaller effect.\r
After central carbon depletion, infalling matter gath\u0002ers momentum that often, but not always results in dy\u0002namical overshoot and explosive oxygen burning. A vari\u0002able carbon abundance in the outer layers of the star can\r
provide varying degrees of support as the core becomes\r
unstable. This can dramatically influence the strength\r
of the instability and the energy, or even the possibility\r
of a subsequent explosion (Farmer et al. 2020). Basi\u0002cally a strong carbon burning shell provides an energy\r
source that increases as the star contracts. Sufficient off\u0002center burning results in oxygen burning igniting stably\r
rather that catastrophically, and the subsequent evolu\u0002tion is very different. Oxygen burning in a shell can still\r
become unstable later, even during silicon burning, but\r
there is less fuel to burn then, and the instability usually\r
results in less matter being ejected."""

Substantial adjustments to the carbon abundance af\u0002ter helium burning are possible because of uncertainties\r
in the critical reaction rates for 3α and 12C(α, γ)\r
16O\r
and the treatment of convective mixing (Farmer et al.\r
2019, 2020; Renzo et al. 2020). Historically, the rate\r
for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O during helium burning has been a ma\u0002jor source of uncertainty for studies of stellar evolution\r
and nucleosynthesis (Weaver & Woosley 1993; Tur et al.\r
2010; West et al. 2013). This rate is characterized by an\r
“S-factor” evaluated at a typical Gamow energy for re\u0002actions during helium burning, which is taken to be 300\r
keV. deBoer et al. (2017) have reviewed the experimental\r
situation and offered their own analysis, concluding that\r
this critical S-factor is most likely 140 ± 21 +18\r
−11 keV b.\r
This is smaller than some other recent publications (see\r
their Table IV) which gave a value near 165 keV b, but\r
usually with larger error bars. In particular, Buchmann\r
(1996), which serves as a reference point in the present\r
study, gave a best value of S300 = 146 keV b with a pos\u0002sible range from 62 to 270 kev,b (see also Buchmann &\r
Barnes 2006). In the same time frame Buchmann et al.\r
(1996) found a best value of S300 =165 ± 75 keV b. Here\r
we shall consider a possible range of S-factors from 110\r
to 205 keV b with a standard value 146 keV b. The lower\r
bound is that of deBoer et al. (2017). The upper bound is\r
a bit larger than theirs, and more consistent with Buch\u0002mann et al. (1996). Past studies of nucleosynthesis (§2.2)\r
have favored such large values. Computationally these\r
variations were effected by multiplying the standard fit\u0002ted rate of Buchmann (1996) by factors, fBuch, ranging\r
from 0.75 to 1.4 (Table 1). As will be shown, Mlow is\r
more sensitive to the rate for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O when it is\r
small than when it is large, which justifies, for now, not\r
exploring larger multipliers than 1.4.\r
Shen et al. (2020) have given a recent reevaluation of\r
the electric quadrupole part of the reaction rate SE2 = 80\r
±40 keV b which is larger than the 45 keV b adopted by\r
deBoer et al. (2017) and more consistent with Buchmann\r
et al. (1996). They recommend that the error bar on the\r
deBoer et al. rate be raised from +18 to +39 keV b,\r
i.e., the total S-factor is more likely to be larger than\r
146 keV b than smaller.\r
The rate for the 3α reaction depends on the radiative\r
width for the “Hoyle state”, a 0+ resonance at an exci\u0002tation energy of 7.65 MeV in 12C. A small correction is\r
generally added to the radiative width for pair emission.\r
Summarizing previous work, Freer & Fynbo (2014) gave\r
what might be considered the previous standard value\r
for this width, Γrad = 3.78 meV (i.e., 3.78 × 10−3eV).\r
This is close to the value used in Caughlan & Fowler\r

In a very close binary, where little or no extended hy\u0002drogen envelope can be tolerated, the evolution of pure\r
helium stars can be used to approximate the final pre\u0002supernova state (e.g., Woosley 2017). Helium stars or\r
carbon-oxygen stars will also be the end state of evo\u0002lution where the metallicity is sufficiently high that the\r
envelope is lost to a wind or the rotation so rapid as to\r
induce chemically homogeneous evolution (Maeder 1987)\r
on the main sequence. Once revealed the helium star\r
will also experience mass loss by winds, especially if the\r
metallicity is large. During the post-helium burning evo\u0002lution, the evolution is so fast that mass loss by winds is\r
negligible. As will be shown (§2.4), helium cores evolved\r
at constant mass are a good approximation to the evo\u0002lution of heavier helium cores that include mass loss. It\r
is the final mass that matters.\r
This simplification motivates a study of reaction-rate\r
sensitivity in helium stars stars of constant mass. Similar\r
studies have been carried out by Farmer et al. (2019) and\r
Farmer et al. (2020). We consider here the variation of\r
just the rates for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α because of their\r
key role in determining the carbon abundance when the\r
star becomes unstable. It is assumed that once an iron\r
core is formed, typically around 2 M\f, that iron core and\r
all the remaining star collapses to a black hole. This will\r
not necessarily be the case if the star is very rapidly\r
rotating (§4).\r
Models are calculated using the Kepler code and the\r
same physics and zoning as in Woosley (2017). Convec\u0002tion is left on during interpulse periods, but only in the\r
core where where hydrostatic equilibrium prevails. Con\u0002vection speeds are always limited to 20 % sonic, and con\u0002vective velocities do not adjust instantaneously, but with\r
a growth rate that is limited to the (inverse of the) con\u0002vective time scale. Interpulse convection can sometime\r
play an important role in mixing combustible fuel, i.e.,\r
helium and carbon to deeper depths in the star where it\r
affects the strength of the next pulse. All models con\u0002tained in excess of 2,400 mass shells, with finer zoning\r
near the center and surface. Typical simulations took\r
about 20,000 time steps, though sometimes much more,\r
to reach core collapse. Nuclear energy generation was\r
generally treated using the 19 isotope approximation net\u0002work in Kepler and the 128 isotope quasiequilibrium\r
network once the central oxygen mass fraction fell be\u0002low 0.05. About 20 models were also calculated using\r
an adaptable network (Rauscher et al. 2002) with typi\u0002cally 250 isotopes from hydrogen to germanium coupled\r
directly to the structure calculation. Changing networks\r
caused final remnant masses to vary by at most 1 M\f ex\u0002cept near the critical mass where the star fully exploded\r
after the first pulse (§2.3.2). Small differences made a\r
large difference in outcome for these cases, but the value\r
of Mlow for a given choice of nuclear physics was not\r
greatly affected."""

text = """
Results for Mlow are given in Table 1. As dis\u0002cussed by Farmer et al. (2019), decreasing the rate for\r
12C(α, γ)16O, or raising the rate for 3α results in a larger\r
amount of carbon being present in the outer part of the\r
star when the pair-instability is first encountered after\r
central carbon depletion. The energy generated in these\r
shells inhibits the collapse to oxygen ignition and thus\r
makes the explosion milder. In cases with large carbon\r
abundance, i.e., low 12C(α, γ)\r
16O or high 3α, the energy\r
from carbon shell burning can even trigger its own series\r
of weak pair-instability pulsations. This affects the final\r
remnant mass very little, but might provide a low mass\r
shell around the star when it finally dies.\r
A key point is that if the carbon abundance is large\r
enough, central oxygen burning can ignite stably with en\u0002ergy transported by convection. If a substantial amount\r
of oxygen burns stably, then the reservoir of fuel for fu\u0002ture explosive events is reduced, even if they occur. The\r
pulsational pair instability is thus weakened. Less mat\u0002ter is ejected with lower energy. This trend of weaker\r
pulsations when the carbon abundance is high is appar\u0002ent in Table 1. Though the focus here is on remnant\r
masses, this behavior also has important implications for\r
the properties of any supernovae resulting from the pul\u0002sational pair instability. The energies are still sufficient\r
to power a bright Type II supernova in stars where a\r
hydrogen envelope is retained. The light curves of these\r
supernova will lack radioactive tails and eject almost no\r
new heavy elements, but the energy and brightness of su\u0002pernovae resulting from colliding shells will be less. For\r
unfavorable values of reaction rates, this makes PPISN\r
even less likely to produce superluminous supernovae\r
(Woosley 2017).\r
For models with small carbon abundances, i.e., large\r
12C(α, γ)16O or small 3α rates, the characteristics of\r
PPISN are not very sensitive to the rates. Focusing on\r
just those models where only 12C(α, γ)\r
16O is varied, the\r
maximum black hole mass is 46, 46, 48, and 56 M\f for\r
rate multipliers fBuch = 1.4, 1.2, 1.0, and 0.8. For the\r
larger multipliers, the carbon burning shells are weak and\r
the pair instability is strong. These were the cases ex\u0002plored by Woosley (2017). For central carbon mass frac\u0002tions at helium burning greater than about 0.15 though,

4\r
the nature of the solution changes dramatically. For the\r
most extreme cases considered here, the pair instability\r
is essentially absent. Only some weak pulses occur near\r
the end of the stars life when the core is already well\r
into silicon burning. For intermediate values, the pair\r
instability is still present, but suppressed to a varying\r
extent.\r
Increasing the 3α rate can further raise Mlow. For\r
fBuch = 0.75 and f3α = 1.35, the maximum black hole\r
mass is near 64 M\f. Larger values could be obtained by\r
further manipulation of the rates (Farmer et al. 2019,\r
2020), and by including rotation (§4), but pending fur\u0002ther experimental studies, we regard such variations of\r
reaction rates as unlikely, especially given the potential\r
problems with nucleosynthesis."""

Uncertainties in the reaction rates can also have an\r
important effect on the upper boundary of the pair\u0002instability gap (Table 2). The least massive black hole\r
above the gap, Mhigh, now ranges from 136 to 161 M\f for\r
the same choices of reaction rates as in Table 1. There\r
is a notable shift for fBuch = 1.2 from the value given\r
by Heger & Woosley (2002), Mhigh = 133.3 M\f, to the\r
new value, Mhigh = 139 M\f, a change of 4.3 % resulting\r
solely from different code physics.\r
About half of this change comes from directly coupling\r
a large reaction network of about 200 isotopes to the stel\u0002lar structure calculation, taking smaller time steps, and\r
other minor changes to the Kepler code in the last 20\r
years. The calculations of Heger & Woosley (2002) only\r
used a 19 isotope approximation network for energy gen\u0002eration and “coprocessed” with a much larger network to\r
obtain nucleosynthesis. The quasiequilibrium network in\r
Kepler was not used due to problems at that time with\r
convectively coupled zones containing a varying amount\r
of oxygen at explosive temperatures.\r
The other half comes from different assumptions re\u0002garding convection during the implosion. In Heger &\r
Woosley (2002), it was assumed that convection did not\r
occur during the implosion once carbon was depleted in\r
the central zone. Here, for the standard cases, time\u0002dependent mixing-length convection is allowed to pro\u0002ceed in zones that are not supersonically collapsing, i.e.,\r
vcol < cs, but the convective speed used in the mixing\r
length calculation is limited, in all zones, to vconv <\r
0.2 cs. Here cs is the local sound speed. Additional stud\u0002ies in which the zonal collapse speed limiter was reduced\r
to vcol < 0.3 cs while retaining vconv < 0.2 cs showed little\r
deviation from Table 2. If those limiters were further de\u0002creased though, to vcol < 0.1 cs and vconv < 0.1 cs, Mhigh\r
was reduced. More efficient mixing of oxygen downwards\r
during the implosion leads to greater burning and in\u0002creases Mhigh. The values in Table 2 are thus probably\r
upper limits for non-rotating models and the actual val\u0002ues could be 2 % smaller. As noted previously, small\r
changes in physics can have an large effect near the cusp\r
of a transition from full collapse to full explosion. These\r
changes thus had a much greater effect on Mhigh than\r
Mlow.\r
Rotation could also substantially decrease Mhigh by\r
weakening the pair instability, but that was not explored\r
here. See §4 for the effect of rotation on Mlow.\r

Stellar winds reduce the mass of the star and alter\r
the thickness of the helium burning shell relative to the\r
carbon-oxygen core. Being farther out in the star, the\r
influence of the residual helium is reduced relative to car\u0002bon, but helium burns at a lower temperature and gen\u0002erates more energy, and so can still have a minor effect.\r
Stars with the large masses considered here have con\u0002vective helium burning cores that extend through more\r
90 % of their mass when helium is half burned, so most\r
of the post-helium burning star is carbon and oxygen.\r
Some helium always remains in the outer layers of the\r

Table 4 of Woosley 2019). The convective core recedes\r

Many factors affect the carbon abundance in the core\r
of a massive star following helium burning: the reaction\r
rates for 3α and 12C(α, γ)\r
16O; the treatment of semi\u0002convection and convective overshoot mixing; rotationally\r
induced mixing; radiative mass loss (§2.4); and whether\r
the star is in a mass exchanging binary (Woosley 2019).\r
Fortunately, the structure of a very massive star during\r
its final stages of helium burning is quite simple. Be\u0002cause the luminosity is nearly Eddington and the struc\u0002ture near that of an n = 3 polytrope, helium stars of the\r
mass considered are almost fully convective throughout\r
most of their helium-burning evolution. Their compo\u0002sitions and entropies, except for a small mass near the\r
surface, are nearly constant. The helium exhausted ma\u0002terial includes most of the matter that participates in\r
burning during a PPISN or PISN. The remainder, near\r
the surface, while composed of a mixture of helium and\r
carbon, has an electron mole number near Ye = 0.50.\r
The star’s structure, which is most sensitive to the elec\u0002tron density, is thus not very much affected by the ratio\r
of helium to carbon.\r
These characteristics and a desire to better understand\r
the star’s composition affects Mlow motivate an explo\u0002ration of stars consisting initially of just carbon and oxy\u0002gen in a ratio that does not vary with location in the star.\r
The composition reflects what exists at the end of helium\r
burning and condenses many of the uncertainties men\u0002tioned above into a single parameter, the carbon mass\r
fraction. Once a grid of explosions has been calculated\r
for a suitable range of carbon mass fractions, the future\r
properties of the supernova can determined for any model\r
by comparing its actual carbon mass fraction at helium\r
depletion to the grid. Since the carbon mass fraction is\r
bounded, so too is the maximum mass black hole that\r
can be produced following the pulsational-pair instabil\u0002ity.\r

burning can weaken the pair instability. Whether the\r
outer layers of the star are carbon or helium makes lit\u0002tle difference to their structure, but the burning of he\u0002lium during the implosion can weaken the first pulse.\r
As a consequence, the remnant masses coming out of\r
pure carbon-oxygen cores could underestimate the ac\u0002tual value of Mlow. The other complication is that he\u0002lium burning in such massive stars produces not just 12C\r
and 16O, but appreciable 20Ne and even some 24Mg as\r
well. The abundances of these heavier nuclei can become\r
comparable to the carbon abundance itself for those cases\r
where the 12C(α, γ)\r
16O reaction rate is large and the 3α\r
rate small. For the converse cases, perhaps of greater\r
interest here, where the carbon abundance after helium\r
burning is large, the carbon shell dominates and both\r
the burning of helium and the abundance of neon have\r
little effect. The effects of neon are also mitigated by the\r
fact that neon burning never becomes an exoergic phase\r
in such massive stars. Neutrino losses dominate and the\r
products of neon burning are oxygen and magnesium, so\r
half the 20Ne ends up in 16O anyway. The bulk energy\r
yields of the neon-rich and neon-poor compositions also\r
differ very little. Burning the “0.05/Ne” composition in\r
Table 4 to 28Si gives 4.63 × 1017 erg g−1 whereas burning\r
the “0.05” composition to 28Si gives 4.69 × 1017 erg g−1.\r
Nevertheless, having a substantial abundance of neon can\r
sometimes affect the strength of carbon shell burning and\r
it will be necessary to demonstrate the sensitivity of the\r
answer to the neglect of neon and magnesium in the ini\u0002tial composition and of helium in the outer layers.\r
Table 4 gives the results. Carbon-oxygen stars of con\u0002stant mass with the initial carbon mass fractions indi\u0002cated were evolved until the star either completely dis\u0002perses as a PISN or its iron core collapses. Except for\r
the three columns noted, the remainder of the initial star\r
was all 16O. The range of carbon mass fractions span\r
what we consider to be reasonable values for current re\u0002action rates and convective treatments. No helium star\r
in §2.3 gave a central carbon mass fraction less than 0.05\r
or greater than 0.25. In two of the exceptional series of\r
models, those marked “0.05/Ne” and “0.1/Ne”, more re\u0002alistic neon-rich compositions were considered. Helium\r
star models in Table 1 show that when the carbon mass\r
fraction after helium burning is 0.05, the mass fractions\r
of 20Ne and 24Mg are 0.07 and 0.01 respectively. When\r
carbon is 0.1, 20Ne and 24Mg are 0.05 and 0.005. Surveys\r
using these “neon-rich” compositions are also shown for\r
comparison in Table 4.\r
The effects of a helium shell were also considered in a\r
series of models labeled “0.05/He”. In the inner 85 % of\r
their mass, these stars had compositions of 5 % carbon\r
and 95 % oxygen by mass. In their outer 15 % though\r
the composition was 5 % carbon, 90 % oxygen and 5 %\r
helium. This typically amounted to about 0.4 M\f of he\u0002lium, small even for mass losing stars (§2.4). As expected\r
the presence of helium generally led to larger black hole\r
masses. The effects of both neon and helium in the “0.05”\r
case was an increase of about 2 M\f (5 %) each in Mlow.\r
The “0.05” case should give an upper bound on these ef\u0002fects because the carbon plays an increasingly dominant\r
role in the others.\r
Comparing Table 4 for carbon-oxygen stars with Ta\u0002ble 1 for helium stars that have similar carbon mass frac\u0002tions at helium depletion, one sees that discrepancy is\r
never great, but is least when the carbon-mass fraction\r
is large. Not only is the neon abundance smaller in such\r
cases, but the effects of carbon shell burning dominate\r
those of helium shell burning. Conversely, when the car\u0002bon abundance is small, neon and helium have a big\u0002ger effect. For For X(\r
12C) = 0.05, Mlow is 41 M\f for\r
carbon-oxygen stars, but 46 M\f for helium stars with\r
fBuch = 1.4. About half the difference is due to the large\r
neon mass fraction and the other half is due to the helium\r
shell (columns “0.05/He” and “0.05/Ne”). For X(\r
12C)\r
= 0.125, on the other hand, Mlow is 47 M\f for carbon\u0002oxygen stars and 48 M\f for helium stars with fBuch = 1.\r
For X(\r
12C) = 0.25, Mlow is 64 M\f for carbon-oxygen\r
stars and 64 M\f for helium stars with fBuch = 0.75 and\r
A 3α rate 1.35 times standard. Variations of 1 - 2 M\f\r
are expected in any survey due to zoning, time step, net\u0002work, number of pulses, etc. Thus unless the carbon\r
abundance is less than about 0.1, the simpler carbon\u0002oxygen cores can be substituted for helium stars in our\r
search for Mlow.\r
As with the helium stars, the maximum black hole\r
mass in Table 4 is not very sensitive to the exact value\r
of the initial fraction of carbon so long as that frac\u0002tion is small. For carbon fractions from 0.05 to 0.15,\r
Mlow varies only between 41 and 48 M\f (and 41 M\f is\r
an underestimate as we have just discussed). For larger\r
values though, as would occur for small values of the\r
12C(α, γ)16O reaction cross section or a large value for\r
triple-alpha, Mlow increases dramatically.\r
To summarize, for a S-factor greater than 110 keV b\r
(deBoer et al. 2017) and a triple-alpha rate no greater\r
than 1.35 times the traditional value, the carbon mass\r
fraction in our models is no greater than 0.25 at helium\r
depletion. This robustly implies a most massive black\r
hole below the pair instability gap of Mlow = 64 M\f with\r
an expected error of about 2 M\f. Pending further exper\u0002iments, we regard this as the upper limit to the black hole\r
mass one can obtain in a close mass exchanging binary\r
by adjusting only the nuclear reaction rates. Additional\r
corrections for mass loss are small (Table 3 vs. Table 1)."""

the effect of the pair instability. Woosley (2017) found\r
that a black hole of 65 M\f resulted from the evolution\r
of a 70 M\f star with a a very low mass loss rate (Model\r
T70C). That calculation was for a relatively large rate for\r
12C(α, γ)16O (fBuch = 1.2) and a standard value for 3α.\r
Whereas not attempting a full survey, we consider here\r
the evolution of six metal-deficient massive stars, Mod\u0002els T90C, T100C, T110C, T120C, T130C, and T140C\r
(see Table 2 Woosley 2017), using variations on the reac\u0002tion rates chosen to produce large central carbon abun\u0002dances at helium depletion. These models did not rotate\r
and had zero age main sequence masses of 90 to 140 M\f.\r
Their metallicity was 10% solar, but their mass loss rate\r
as main sequence stars and red supergiants was further\r
reduced by an additional factor of 8 compared to the\r
standard value for that metallicity. This would require\r
a still lower value of metallicity or mass loss rates much\r
less than standard values for 10 % solar metallicity.\r
Final presupernova masses, helium core masses, and\r
remnant masses are given in Table 5 along with the vari\u0002ations in reaction rates and resulting carbon mass frac\u0002tion at helium depletion. The behavior of these full star\r
explosions generally follows from Table 1 and Table 4,\r
but due to the non-negligible boundary pressure of the\r
hydrogen shell, the equivalent helium core mass in Ta\u0002ble 5 is smaller than for the bare helium star models.\r
Given their large carbon mass fractions, the pair insta\u0002bility in Models T90Ca and T100Cb is mild and launches\r
weak shocks having initial speeds of only 100’s of km s−1.\r
These shocks appear late in the evolution after stable

8\r
central oxygen burning and most of silicon core burning\r
have already transpired. Typical explosion energies were\r
1047 erg or less. This only suffices to eject a small amount\r
of material near the surface, even in a red supergiant, so\r
the remnant mass very nearly equals the presupernova\r
mass.\r
Other models experienced stronger pulsations, though\r
still late in their evolution. The presupernova models\r
were all characterized by large radii, >∼1014 cm, but had\r
surface convection zones that had not dredged up the\r
entire envelope. The net binding energy of the dredged\r
up material for all six stars was, to within about a fac\u0002tor of two, ∼ 1048 erg, while the binding of all matter\r
external to the helium core, including the part that was\r
not convective, was greater that ∼ 1050 erg. Thus when\r
explosions developed with energy of order 1049 erg, typ\u0002ical mass separations lay beneath, but not far beneath\r
the base of the convective part of the envelope (Models\r
110Cb and 120Cb). These mass separations were difficult\r
to determine because shock speeds were so slow that fall\u0002back continued for decades following the initial collapse.\r
The location of the base of the convective zone is also\r
model dependent since it is sensitive to the convection\r
model, the opacity and metallicity, and mass loss. The\r
depth of this zone was also slightly different at helium de\u0002pletion, carbon ignition (where the evaluations in Table 5\r
were made), and carbon depletion. Had the model been\r
a luminous blue variable or blue supergiant, the binding\r
of the envelope might have been greater and so would\r
the remnant mass, but then mass loss for the luminous\r
blue variable could have been large. For larger explosion\r
energies (Models 100Ca, 130Cb and 140Cb) the mass\r
cut is more precisely determined. For all models except\r
T140Cb, the pulses occurred so late that the iron core\r
collapsed while the outgoing shock from the pulses was\r
still inside the star.\r
For the small values of 12C(α, γ)\r
16O rate and large 3α,\r
black holes of 85 M\f and more are possible. These are\r
cases where the advanced stages of evolution are essen\u0002tially stable and pulsational mass loss is negligible (Mod\u0002els T90Ca and 100Cb). Since the helium core properties\r
are largely independent of the mass loss rate, unless the\r
whole envelope is lost, somewhat larger black hole masses\r
could be achieved given ones tolerance for reducing the\r
mass loss rate, but probably not much beyond 100 M\f.\r
It is interesting that black holes of such high mass can\r
form, even in isolation. If they were to some day be cap\u0002tured in another system, one would not need to resort to\r
multiple mergers to build up a black hole of 85 M\f.\r
As noted before, there might be problems with mak\u0002ing a LIGO source directly this way. Given the large\r
radii of the stars, bringing the resulting black hole from\r
the first explosion close enough to the secondary in order\r
to merge in a Hubble time requires additional assump\u0002tions. One possibility is that the primary (which makes\r
the more massive black hole) was a blue supergiant or lu\u0002minous blue variable and the secondary a red supergiant\r
when they died. The larger radius for the secondary\r
might provoke mass exchange that was avoided for the\r
primary. This might happen e.g., if the secondary was\r
a low metallicity star that made primary nitrogen when\r
its helium convective core encroached on the hydrogen\r
envelope while the primary did not. Such evolution is\r
often seen for stars of this large mass and low metallicity\r
(e.g., Heger & Woosley 2010).\r
Another possibility is kicks during the explosion (Tu\u0002tukov & Cherepashchuk 2017). The difficulty here is that\r
if no mass is ejected in a jet, the kick must be a conse\u0002quence of asymmetric neutrino emission, but neutrino\r
losses are a small fraction of the stellar mass. Once a\r
black hole forms, without rapid rotation, the infalling\r
material does not radiate neutrinos effectively. If neu\u0002trino emission is restricted to just the phase of proto\u0002neutron star evolution, then the losses are probably no\r
more than 0.5 M\f c"""

seems liberal, the kick for an 80 M\f black hole would\r
then be (0.5)(0.05)/80 c ∼ 100 km s−1. These neutrinos\r

direction of orbital motion. This could cancel the or\u0002bital momentum for a wide enough separation, but the\r

Rotation weakens the pair instability (Fowler & Hoyle\r

radius. Since a real star has neither constant Γ1 or ωk,\r
this criterion may or may not be satisfied in different\r
regions of the star at different times. Whether there is\r
a global instability depends upon the integrated average\r
(Marchant & Moriya 2020).\r
The strength of the pair instability also depends sen\u0002sitively upon the temperature and is weaker when the\r
star first begins to contract and gain momentum, and\r
greater at the end when oxygen burns explosively. The\r
accumulated momentum during the collapse plays an im\u0002portant dynamical role. Typical maximum decrements\r
in Γ1 from the pair instability for the masses being stud\u0002ied, once the central temperature exceeds 2 × 109 K, are\r
a few percent locally (relative to a fiducial 1.33), and\r
∼1 % globally (Fig. 1). This implies that differential\r
rotation in the deep interior with ωk\r
>∼ 10 % will be re\u0002quired to alleviate the instability. Smaller amounts of\r
rotation can still affect the outcome though by leverag\u0002ing the evolution early on when the instability is weak.\r
Marchant & Moriya (2020) found a typical increase in\r
black hole mass of ∼4 % when magnetic torques (Spruit\r
2002) were included in the models, and ∼15 % when they\r
were not. Since ignoring magnetic torques would give a\r
very rapid rotation rate for pulsars and possibly over\u0002produce gamma-ray bursts (Woosley & Heger 2006), the\r
inclusion of magnetic torques is probably more realistic.\r
Unfortunately, rapid rotation affects the evolution of

9\r
massive stars in many ways, and disentangling them com\u0002plicates any conclusion regarding the black hole birth\r
function. Rotation leads to mixing that results, at a\r
minimum, in larger helium cores for a given main se\u0002quence mass. At a maximum, the star may become fully\r
mixed on the main sequence and experience chemically\u0002homogeneous evolution (Maeder 1987). Rotationally\u0002induced mixing can transport additional helium into the\r
convective helium burning core at late times, thus de\u0002creasing the carbon yield and lowering the remnant mass\r
(Table 4). Rotation reduces the central density mak\u0002ing the star evolve like one of lower mass (Marchant &\r
Moriya 2020). Rapid rotation can lead to mass shedding\r
at the equator, especially in stars that are already near\r
the Eddington limit - as these are. Rotation can mix he\u0002lium or carbon down during the implosion so that shell\r
burning has a greater effect during the first pulse. Ro\u0002tation can alter the way the collapsing iron core behaves\r
and allow explosions to develop where the star would\r
have collapsed if neutrino transport were the only mech\u0002anism. If the rotation of the remnant is too rapid, not\r
all of the star can immediately collapse to a black hole\r
without making a disk. The formation of a “collapsar”\r
may produce a jet that explodes the remaining star or,\r
at the least, inhibits its full collapse.\r
The amount and distribution of angular momentum\r
also depends critically upon uncertain mechanisms for\r
its transport and the rates for mass loss. Transport con\u0002centrates angular momentum in the outer layers of the\r
star where mass loss removes it. To neglect mass loss\r
is to overestimate the role of rotation in the evolution,\r
but to include it adds another uncertain parameter to the\r
outcome, a parameter that will itself vary in an uncertain\r
way with metallicity.\r
For all these reasons, the results in this section are\r
less precise than those in the previous ones. A one\u0002dimensional code is used to calculate the effects of a\r
two-dimensional phenomenon - rotation. Angle averag\u0002ing and a semi-empirical formulation is necessary. Mass\r
loss by winds is neglected, though see §4.3. What is\r
most important is the angular momentum distribution\r
the star has at carbon ignition since radiation-driven\r
mass loss can presumably can be neglected after that.\r
Though we follow all stars through helium burning, they\r
approach carbon ignition with essentially the same an\u0002gular momentum distribution they started with - nearly\r
rigid rotation characterized by a single parameter, Jinit,\r
the initial total angular momentum of the star.\r
Rotational mixing and angular momentum transport\r
by the usual dynamical processes (Heger et al. 2000) were\r
included in all stages of the evolution, including the inter\u0002pulse periods. Time-dependent convection is also left on\r
during inter-pulse periods in that portion of the star that\r
remains in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e., is not moving su\u0002personically. Except where specified, angular momentum\r
transport by magnetic torques is included (Spruit 2002;\r
Heger et al. 2005).\r
Unlike our past studies of pair instability, an approx\u0002imate centrifugal support term has been added to the\r
momentum equation as\r

Ω\r
2\r
r\r
(2)\r
where j is the average specific angular momentum of the\r
shell, r is the radius of the shell, and Ω is the angular\r
velocity of the shell. Shells are assumed to be spherical\r
and rigidly rotating (solid body rotation for each shells).\r
Different shells may rotate at different angular velocity.\r
The factor 9/4 is because, for a spherical shell in solid ro\u0002tation, the average angular momentum at the equator is\r
3/2 times the average. The factor f accounts for averag\u0002ing the centrifugal force over the surface, and should be\r
2/3. Our approximation does not take into account any\r
deformation of the shell or that the centrifugal forces\r
would be larger at the equator than at the pole.\r
The helium stars studied here are assumed to initially\r
rotate rigidly and are characterized by a total angular\r
momentum, Jinit = 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 × 1053 erg s.\r
Several choices of reaction rates are explored. Except for\r
rotation, the physics and computational procedure here\r
are the same as for non-rotating helium stars in §2.3.\r
Rotational mass shedding is included and is important\r
for many models with Jinit >∼ 6 × 1052 erg s. A surface\r
zone is assumed to be lost when its angular velocity ex\u0002ceeds 50 % of Keplerian (i.e., ωk > 0.5). This value,\r
corresponding to a ratio of centrifugal force to gravity\r
of 25 %, is an upper bound since the luminosity of the\r
stars considered here is typically ∼ 90 % Eddington. In\r
any case, a larger value would make the approximation\r
of spherical stars highly questionable. Values of ωk this\r

density rises from around 1,000 g cm−3 prior to carbon\r
ignition (T9,c = 0.5) to 107 g cm−3 during silicon burn\u0002ing. As the star attempts to maintain rigid rotation, the\r
surface of the star is spun up, resulting in mass loss. This\r

nuclear reaction rates chosen to span most of the range\r

f3α = 1; “medium”, fBuch = 1.0, f3α = 1.35; or “large”,\r
fBuch = 0.75, f3α = 1.35. Magnetic torques are included\r
all the time in all models except 64b, 66b, 68b, and 80b.\r
The rotating models in Table 6 will be denoted by their\r
mass and the choice of reaction rates and angular mo\u0002mentum used in their calculation. Model 601.2,12 thus\r

yield such similar results because of the stochastic na\u0002ture of multiple pulses and sensitivity to slight changes\r
in the angular momentum distribution and composition.\r
The agreement was especially poor for models near the\r
threshold of full explosion like 661.2,6 and 681.2,12, and\r
for models with little rotational mass shedding.\r
Still, the implication is that it would not be fruitful\r
to consider models with much larger rotation rates than\r
Jinit,52 = 12. The excess momentum would simply be\r
shed early in the evolution and the maximum black hole\r
mass would not be greatly increased. This is particularly\r
true since the criterion for rotational mass loss, ωk = 0.5\r
at the surface, is already too large for stars so near the\r
Eddington limit.\r
Also shown in Table 6 is the energy of the first pulse\r
and the mass of the star after that pulse (including the\r
effects of rotational mass shedding prior to the pulse).\r
These characteristics follow expectations more consis\u0002tently than final properies. For a given angular momen\u0002tum, the mass ejected and the kinetic energy of that\r
mass, KEpulse1 increase with initial mass. For a given\r
initial mass, Mpulse1 increases with initial angular mo\u0002mentum, while KEpulse1 decreases. In cases where the\r
central carbon mass fraction and initial angular momen\u0002tum are high, the stars often ignite central oxygen burn\u0002ing stably. Such stas may also experience a long phase of\r
numerous, weak pulsations due to the burning of carbon\r
in a shell. The mass lost prior to oxygen burning in such\r
models is small though.\r
A strong first pulse on the other hand implies a long\r
wait before the next pulse while the star relaxes from a\r
highly extended, weakly bound state. During this time,\r
angular momentum can be transported out of the core by\r
shear, magnetic torques, and convection. For these cases,\r
subsequent pulses are not so influenced by rotation as the\r
first one and can also be quite strong.\r
Indeed, the transport of angular momentum by mag\u0002netic torques prior to oxygen ignition and during the\r
long interpulse periods, when they exist, is a major un\u0002certainty in these calculations. Eliminating them re\u0002duces rotational mass shedding. Angular momentum\r
that might have been transported to the surface and\r
lost remains concentrated in the central core where it\r
influences the subsequent evolution. Fig. 2 shows the\r
evolution of the angular velocity and the ratio of the an\u0002gular velocity to Keplerian, ωk, for Model 661.2,12 with\r
and without magnetic torques (models in Table 6 that\r
end in b, like “66b” did not include magnetic torques).\r
Early on, near carbon ignition at T9 = 0.5, the rota\u0002tional profiles are similar for the two models, though\r
rotational mass shedding has already reduced the angu\u0002lar momentum in the model without magnetic fields. As\r
time passes, the divergence increases and by the time the\r
iron core collapses, there is more than an order of magni\u0002tude difference in the angular momenta of the remnants.\r
The chief cause of divergence in this case is magnetic\r
braking during the thousand year long interval following\r
the second pulse in the model that includes magnetic\r
fields. During that time, the angular momentum in the\r
inner 55.5 M\f of the star (the part destined to be a black\r
hole) declines from 4.2×1052 erg s to 5.4×1051 erg s. The\r
mass of the star is constant during this interval so the\r
excess angular momentum piles up in a mass of just a few\r
M\f near the surface. This is later ejected in a final third\r
pulse so that the star that included magnetic fields ends\r
up making a black hole with spin J52 = 0.53 whereas the\r
one without magnetic fields makes a black hole of nearly\r
the same mass, but with J52 = 6.86.\r
It would not be realistic to ignore magnetic torques\r
during these long Kelvin-Helmholtz episodes while cores\r
recover from prior explosive expansion. The composi\u0002tions, densities. temperatures and rotation rates are sim\u0002ilar to those in stable carbon burning. On the other hand,\r
experimental validation of the simple prescription used\r
is lacking. The correct solution might lie between the\r
two extremes. This means that any estimate of the Kerr\r
parameter for the black holes coming from these rapidly\r
rotating models, especially those with large carbon abun\u0002dance is not reliable.\r

more angular momentum than this cannot form black\r

includes many of the more massive models with large\r
carbon mass fractions in Table 6. Only a small fraction\r
of this angular momentum is in the collapsing iron core\r
itself. Most is in the outer layers. The most likely fate\r
of such cores is to form a black hole surrounded by an\r
accretion disk. This probably leads to the production\r
of jets (Woosley 1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999) and\r
mass ejection. That is, these are excellent candidates for\r
making long soft gamma-ray bursts, and GRBs may be\r
intimately related to the formation of the most massive\r
LIGO sources (see also Marchant & Moriya 2020). The\r

these stars, and is consistent with the need to keep LIGO\r
progenitors compact inside close binaries (Mandel & de\r
Mink 2016).\r
Consider a 70 M\f main sequence star with initial angu\u0002lar momentum J = 4×1053 erg s. This corresponds to an\r
equatorial rotational speed at the surface of 390 km s−1\r
and an angular velocity there that is 32 % Keplerian.\r
With this rotation rate, the star evolves chemically ho\u0002mogeneously (Mandel & de Mink 2016). It never be\u0002comes a giant and consumes all the hydrogen within its\r
mass, except for a small fraction near the surface, while\r
still on the main sequence. It thus evolves directly into a\r
helium star similar to the ones considered in this section.\r
If mass loss were negligible, this initial angular mo\u0002mentum would be preserved and the star would die with\r
values in excess of the largest ones in Table 6, but that is\r
not realistic. On the other hand, with solar metallicity\r
and conventional mass loss rates, the star would end up\r
with too small a mass to encounter the pair instability\r
and would have a negligible amount of angular momen\u0002tum.\r
Consider then the results of substantially decreasing\r
the star’s mass loss rate, perhaps due to a small ini\u0002tial metallicity. Following Sz´ecsi et al. (2015), we con\u0002sider a metallicity of 2 % solar, more specifically an\r
iron mass fraction of 2.92 × 10−5. Their 67 M\f model\r
had a rotational velocity of 400 km s−1, comparable to\r
the 390 km s−1for our 70 M\f model. Their model also\r
evolved chemically homogeneously. For the mass loss\r
prescription they employed, their star had a mass at the\r
end of hydrogen burning of 62.2 M\f. Most of their mass\r
loss occurred after the star became a Wolf-Rayet star\r
with a surface hydrogen mass fraction less than 0.3.\r
Sz´ecsi et al. (2015) used a complicated prescription for\r
mass loss involving multiple sources and interpolation.\r
Here we just use the rates of Nieuwenhuijzen & de Jager\r
(1990) and Yoon (2017) with a multiplicative factor less\r
than one for the Yoon rate. Given the uncertain weak\r
dependence of Yoon’s mass loss rate on metallicity, these\r
reductions are reasonable. With this prescription, our"""

fraction of 0.3 with a mass of 69.4 M\f. Up to that\r
point mass loss was taken from Nieuwenhuijzen & de\r
Jager (1990) and was small. Continued evolution used\r
the Yoon rates with a multiplicative factor 0.5. The star\r
finished hydrogen burning with a mass of 63.7 M\f and\r
a residual angular momentum of 2.3 × 1053 erg s. The\r
model of Sz´ecsi et al. (2015) had a luminosity at hydro\u0002gen depletion of 106.34 L\f and an effective temperature\r
of 80,600 K. Our values were 106.37 L\f and 86,800 K. The\r
slight mismatch in starting mass and rotation rate is in\u0002consequential compared with uncertainties in the mass\r
loss rate.\r
It is necessary to follow the continued evolution\r
through helium burning. Published mass loss rates for\r
metal-poor helium stars span a wide range (Vink 2017;\r
Yoon 2017; Sander et al. 2019; Sander & Vink 2020;\r
Woosley et al. 2020). Here we continued to use the rate of\r
Yoon (2017) scaled, for the given metallicity (2 % solar),\r
by factors of 1, 0.5, and 0.25. All runs were started from\r
the model with central hydrogen mass fraction 0.3. These\r
multipliers gave a range of average mass loss rates during\r
helium burning from 4×10−5 M\f y\r
−1\r
to 1×10−5 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
The instantaneous rate was about a factor of two smaller\r
early in helium burning when the star was still a WNE\r
star and larger later on when it is a WC star. These\r
rates are consistent with what Sander & Vink (2020)\r
have recently published for a metallicity of 2 % to 5 %\r
solar. With these three rates, the final mass of the WC\r
stars at carbon ignition were 47.2, 56.7, and 62.7 M\f and\r
their angular momenta were 2.7, 9.7, and 19 × 1052 erg s.\r
This spans most of the range of angular momenta sam\u0002pled in Table 6. Other choices of initial mass and angular\r

Another source of uncertainty affecting black hole\r
masses in a close binary system is the subsequent interac\u0002tion of the first black hole born with the other star (van\r
Son et al. 2020). It is well known that a black hole can ac\u0002crete at a rate well above the Eddington limit. Accretion\r
rates of solar masses per second are not uncommon dur\u0002ing core collapse simulations in failed supernovae. The\r
excess energy that might have inhibited infall or pow\u0002ered mass outflow is either radiated away as neutrinos\r
or advected into the event horizon and lost (Popham et\r
al. 1999). A less extreme and more relevant example\r
is Model r003 of Sadowski & Narayan (2016). In their\r
3D general relativistic MHD simulation, a 10 M\f black\r
hole accretes at 176 times the Eddington value, that is\r
at at rate 6.7 × 10−6 M\f y\r

. The authors note that the\r
calculations should scale for larger mass black holes and\r
that greater super-Eddington factors are allowed. For\r
an 80 M\f black hole, Model r003 would correspond to\r
an accretion rate of about 5 × 10−5 M\f y\r

. We specu\u0002late that similar flows and characteristics would charac\u0002terize accretion rates on up to 0.001 M\f y\r

& Narayan (2016) note that a portion of the accreted\r

sort of accretion might thus appear as ultra-luminous\r
x-ray sources or SS433 analogues. Indeed, an accre\u0002tion rate of 10−4 M\f y\r
−1 has been inferred for SS 433\r
(Cherepashchuk et al. 2020). Hyper-Eddington accretion\r

complexity of a mass exchanging binary, especially those\r
that might experience common envelope evolution, but\r
our single star models offer some insights. The progen\u0002itors of the more massive LIGO sources were probably\r
stars of ∼ 150 M\f or more and possibly formed in metal\r
deficient regions. One or more stages of common enve\u0002lope evolution are frequently invoked. The accretion by\r
a black hole during a dynamic common envelope phase\r
is currently thought to be small (De et al. 2020), but the\r
evolution leading up to that common envelope is poorly\r
explored for stars of such great masses.\r
We consider here a 130 M\f star finishing its hydrogen\r
burning evolution in a close binary with a black hole of\r
∼ 60 M\f with an initial orbital separation of 300 R\f, or\r
about 2 × 1013 cm. Such a configuration is reasonable\r
for the progenitors of LIGO sources (Bogomazov et al.\r
2018). The initial black hole mass is reasonable for the\r
range of reaction rates and rotation rates considered in\r
this paper. We further assume that the star has 10 %\r
solar metallicity. Its mass after hydrogen burning is thus\r
about 116 M\f (Woosley 2017; Model T130). In the ini\u0002tial configuration the period of the binary is 40 days.\r
The radius of the main sequence star is ∼ 1.5 − 2 R\f\r
throughout hydrogen burning. The main sequence star\r
does not yet fill its Roche lobe.\r
The situation changes as the star completes hydrogen\r
burning, contracts in its center to ignite helium burning,\r
and attempts to become a supergiant. The star devel\u0002ops a surface convective zone that gradually eats into\r
its hydrogen envelope. The rate at which the convec\u0002tive zone moves into the envelope, which is also the time\r
to transition to a supergiant, depends on the theory of\r
semi-convection, but is of order a nuclear time scale, or\r
∼ 105 yr for helium burning. The Kelvin-Helmholtz time\r
scale for the envelope is smaller, a few thousand years. If\r
the envelope were to be lost on either time scale, the loss\r
rate would thus correspond to 0.0002 to 0.002 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
Until close to the end, most of the envelope, by mass, re\u0002mains dense transports radiation by diffusion except for\r
a region just above the hydrogen burning shell.\r
We explored the effect of imposing a limit on the ra\u0002dius of this 116 M\f secondary at 2 × 1013 cm, i.e., man\u0002ually removing all mass beyond this radius as the star\r
attempted to become a giant. A steady state was found\r
with a surface convective zone that had an outer bound\u0002ary that extended nearly to the cut-off radius. The base\r
of this convective shell remained fixed at ∼ 7 × 1012 cm\r
as mass was removed from the top and new matter con\u0002vectively dredged up from the bottom. At any time, this\r
convective shell contained only a few hundredths of a so\u0002lar mass with density ranging from 10−11 g cm−3 at the\r
surface to 10−8 g cm−1 at its base. The binding energy\r
of this convective shell, ∼ 1046 erg, was very small com\u0002pared with the orbital kinetic energy of the black hole,\r
∼ 1050 erg. The Roche radius was inside of this convec\u0002tive envelope, close to its base, but the angular velocity\r
of the black hole within this envelope was supersonic, so\r
stable Roche lobe overflow seems unlikely.\r
Rather we speculate that the friction resulting from\r
the black holes motion drives mass loss from the sec\u0002ondary. Podsiadlowski (2001) has discussed such “fric\u0002tionally driven winds”. If the convective layer is removed,\r
the friction is reduced so the mass loss might be self reg\u0002ulated and determined by the rate at which convection\r
moves into the envelope. We followed our toy model for\r
100 years (about 10,000 steps) , during which the mass\r
loss and convective shell properties remained in steady\r
state. The inferred mass loss rate was 0.0018 M\f y\r
−1\r
.\r
This is a common envelope evolution of sorts, but one\r
that proceeds on a thermal time scale, not a dynamical\r
one (Podsiadlowski 2001). The efficiency for the black\r
hole to retain the mass that is lost by the secondary is\r
unknown, but a total envelope mass of 60 M\f could be\r
lost this way. Growth of the hole by 15 M\f or more\r
(half of the envelope lost to a wind and half that ac\u0002creted) does not seem unreasonable (see also van Son et\r
al. 2020). Over time, the black hole gains mass and, ini\u0002tially at least, moves closer to the secondary. It could be\r
that eventually the interaction becomes stronger as the\r
orbit is narrowed and a more dynamical sort of common\r
envelope evolution occurs. The 60 M\f helium core of the\r
secondary eventually experiences its own pair instability,\r
making a black hole not much smaller than 60 M\f and, if\r
the black holes have become close enough, owing to the\r
action of common envelope evolution jets, or kicks, they\r
merge on a Hubble time. This is clearly a very uncertain\r
and possibly quite rare model."""

might require either that the very massive black hole\r
was captured, i.e., not born in the binary that subse\u0002quently merged, or other special circumstances. That is,\r
pending better determination of uncertain reaction rates,\r
the events in the GWTC-2 catalog (Abbott et al. 2020)\r
might be accounted for with rather standard physics in\r
which there is still a pair gap with Mlow ∼ 60 M\f, but\r
GW190251 requires an alternate explanation. Two pos\u0002sible explanations were discussed here - birth in a de\u0002tached binary (§3) and super-Eddington accretion after\r
black hole birth (§5). See also Tutukov & Cherepashchuk\r
(2017) and van Son et al. (2020).\r
The combination of 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α rates used\r
in our previous studies may have conspired to produce\r
a small value for Mlow. Using the favored value for\r
12C(α, γ)16O from deBoer et al. (2017), 140 keV b for the\r
S-factor, gives 48 M\f (Table 1 with fBuch = 1.0 corre\u0002sponds to S = 146 keV b). If one accepts a major revision\r
to the 3α rate (Kib´edi et al. 2020; Eriksen et al. 2020)\r
but does not change 12C(α, γ)\r
16O, Mlow rises to 57 M\f.\r

and the revised 3α rate from Kib´edi et al. (2020) gives\r
Mlow = 64 M\f, which we presently regard as an upper\r
limit on the likely effects of rate modification alone. This\r
could be augmented by the effects of rotation and future\r
accretion by the black hole, but the direct collapse of an"""

seems unlikely. Rate determinations are best left to the\r
nuclear laboratory, but using this large value of 3α and a

15\r
reduced value for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O may lead to difficulties in\r
stellar nucleosynthesis that have yet to be fully explored\r
(§2.2).\r
A larger range of reaction rates was considered by\r
Farmer et al. (2020), but within the range mutually con\u0002sidered, our results agree reasonably well with Farmer et\r
al. (2019) who gave an upper bound on Mlow of 56 M\f.\r
Due to sparse sampling and the cumulative effects of mul\u0002tiple pulses and burning shells, and based on examining\r
hundreds of models (not all included in the tables), all\r
values given here for Mlow probably have an uncertainty\r
of about ±2 M\f. A value of Mlow = 45 − 65 M\f is rea\u0002sonable for now given our current understanding of the\r
nuclear physics.\r
Similar rate modifications also imply a significant shift\r
in the upper boundary for the pair gap, Mhigh with values\r
ranging from 136 to 161 M\f. Even for our standard rates,\r
fBuch = 1.2 and f3α = 1, there is a significant shift of\r
Mhigh from 133.3 M\f (Heger & Woosley 2002) to 139 M\f\r
because of a better treatment of the nuclear burning and\r
a different treatment of convection during the implosion\r
(§2.3.2).\r
As has been known for some time, single stars that\r
retain part of their hydrogen envelopes when they die\r
can produce more massive black holes. The previous ap\u0002proximate limit for this mass was 65 M\f (Woosley 2017).\r
Here we have shown that the same adjustments to reac\u0002tion rates that raise Mlow and Mhigh for close binaries\r
will also raise the limit for single stars. Our estimate\r
for the maximum mass allowed by variation of reaction\r
rates within their current errors is about 90 M\f (Ta\u0002ble 5). This has several implications. If one can make\r
an 85 M\f black hole in an isolated star and later capture\r
it ina binary, then there only needs to be one stage of\r
capture, not two as would be required if the limit were"""

to make the final system). Second, the 85 M\f black hole\r
might be made in a detached binary, especially in a blue\r
supergiant or luminous blue variable. If the secondary\r
later became a red supergiant because of primary nitro\u0002gen production, the black hole and secondary might still\r
experience a common envelope phase and draw closer.\r
This might be a rare event.\r
Depending a number of uncertainties, rotation could\r
cause moderate to major modifications to Mlow (§4).\r
The maximum effect for our models that include mag\u0002netic torques are larger, by about a factor of two, than\r
those of Marchant & Moriya (2020), probably because we\r
considered a larger range of reaction rates and angular\r
momenta. Rapidly rotating stars that experience chem\u0002ically homogeneous evolution and lose less than 30 % of\r
their mass during hydrogen and helium burning can end\r
their lives with total angular momenta like those in Ta\u0002ble 6. The resulting black hole masses will be apprecia\u0002bly increased beyond those of non-rotating stars and the\r
lower bound on the pair-instability mass gap could be as\r
large as ∼ 70 M\f. Uncertainties include:\r
• The carbon abundance at the end of helium burn\u0002ing, hence the rates for 12C(α, γ)\r
16O and 3α.\r
• The initial angular momentum and the mass loss.\r
The initial angular momentum for the helium star\r
needs to be >∼3 × 1052 erg s to have a major effect.\r
This is reasonable for rapidly rotating stars experi\u0002encing chemically homogeneous evolution with low\r
mass loss rates(§4.3). Using current estimates in\r
the literature for mass loss rates, the maximum\r
metallicity would be between about 1 % and 5 %\r
solar.\r
• Rotational mass shedding. For an angular mo\u0002menta in excess of 6×1052 erg s, much of the excess\r
can be shed before the pair instability is encoun\u0002tered.\r
• Magnetic torques. These are particularly impor\u0002tant and uncertain during the long interpulse peri\u0002ods for events that have a strong first pulse. Too\r
many GRBs and rapidly rotating pulsars would ex\u0002ist if they were left out altogether, but their mag\u0002nitude is uncertain.\r
• Disk formation during the collapse. For those mod\u0002els with high carbon abundance, rapid initial ro\u0002tation, or weak magnetic torques, there may be\r
too much angular momentum for the entire pre\u0002supernova star to collapse to a black hole. Disk\r
formation and the accompanying disk winds and\r
jet-induced explosions may shed the excess angu\u0002lar momentum, but the amount of mass ejected is\r
uncertain. It might be small. If rotation is respon\u0002sible for the most massive black holes, the final\r
dimensionless Kerr parameter could be close to 1.\r
The effects of rotation on Mhigh were not explored but\r
might be smaller owing both to the stronger pair instabil\u0002ity in such massive stars and the likelihood of rotational\r
mass shedding in stars so near the Eddington limit.\r
Perhaps the most uncertain aspect of Mlow is the ac\u0002cretion the black hole experiences after it is born. This\r
might occur either during the common envelope phase\r
that is frequently invoked to bring the stars together or\r
during frictionally-induced mass loss by the secondary\r
after it finishes hydrogen burning. Here we focused on\r
the latter. As the secondary first expands beyond about\r
1013 cm the surface convective zone contains little mass.\r
Most of the envelope is radiative. If that small mass\r
spills over onto the black hole, it will be replenished on\r
a thermal time scale by the envelope. Envelope masses\r
may be ∼ 50 M\f and thermal time scales are thousands\r
of years so accretion rates of 10−3 − 10−2 M\f y\r
−1 might\r
occur. At such grossly super-Eddington rates the black\r
hole will accrete most of the matter, but also produce\r
strong bipolar outflows (Sadowski & Narayan 2016)."""
