Local relevant deformations are important tool to study universal properties of quantum critical\r
points. We investigate the effect of small relevant deformations on the bi-partite entanglement\r
entropy at the quantum critical points. Within the quantum critical region, a universal power-law\r
correction in the entanglement entropy induced by the relevant operator is found in both one- and\r
two-dimensional critical lattice models. The exponent of the power-law correction term is determined\r
by the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. Based on numerical simulations and scaling theory\r
argument, it is conjectured that such a universal power-law correction in the entanglement entropy\r
is universal for Lorentz invariant quantum critical points. Without Lorentz invariance, it is found\r
the exponent in the power-law correction term does not fit in with the scaling argument in models\r
with a dynamical exponent z = 2 in two dimension. This may be because the relevant operator\r
added in the lattice model corresponds to complicated operators in the corresponding conformal\r
field theory. Our study provides a different perspective to extract universal information of quantum\r
critical points. We expect it would be useful to detect unique properties of topological quantum\r
phase transitions.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Along with the recent fast development of quantum\r
computing technologies, the study and understanding\r
of quantum entanglement becomes one of the most im\u0002portant topics. As a key concept in quantum theo\u0002ries, the entanglement has already inspired many re\u0002searches for both high energy and condensed matter\r
physics in recent years. The measure of the amount of\r
quantum entanglement, the entanglement entropy (EE)\r
S := −tr (ρA log(ρA)) (ρA is the reduced density matrix\r
for the sub-region A in the whole system) deepens our un\u0002derstanding of quantum matter in many aspects [1–22],\r
especially in the study of gapped quantum phases. The\r
famous area law for the EE in gapped ground states not\r
only reveals the relation between degrees of freedom in a\r
quantum system [1–3], but also inspired novel quantum\r
many-body frameworks [4–6].Moreover, a finer structure\r
of the entanglement, including the degeneracy in the en\u0002tanglement spectrum and the long-range entanglement,\r
becomes the key to classify gapped topological quantum\r
phases [4, 7–11].\r
The entanglement scaling is also found important ap\u0002plications in critical systems [12–26]. The logarithmic\r
scaling of the EE becomes one of the canonical methods\r
to identify one-dimensional quantum critical points and\r
extract the central charge for the underlying conformal\r
field theory (CFT) [3, 12–15]. For two-dimensional quan\u0002tum critical points, the corner EE is found to be related\r
to Goldstone modes and is utilized to diagnose a class of\r
controversial quantum phase transitions [23, 24]. Despite\r
these successful applications of entanglement in critical-\r
∗ pengchen@ucas.ac.cn\r
ity, the information of the fixed point is not included\r
there. For example, one can extract the central charge\r
from the scaling the EE, however there may be different\r
CFTs with the same central charge [27, 28]. A natural\r
question is thus how one can find universal data from\r
the EE. Recently it is found in one dimensions, the en\u0002tanglement spectrum can be used to detect the operator\r
contents of the corresponding CFT in some cases, pro\u0002vided with some other input information [15, 25, 26, 29].\r
For two-dimensional universalities, or even more general\r
cases without emergent Lorentz invariance, it is still an\r
open question.\r
From the scaling theory viewpoint, the universal scal\u0002ing form of the EE [3] at the quantum critical point al\u0002lows one to resemble local physical quantities and re\u0002gard it as a quantity with a scaling dimension. For\r
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent\r
Lorentz invariance, such as the two-dimensional critical\r
quantum Ising model on the square lattice, the EE sat\u0002isfies an area law. One may expect close to the quantum\r
critical point, a scaling theory may be written down for\r
the EE and its deviation from the area law be universal.\r
There has already been research in this area, primarily\r
focusing on conformal field theory in (1+1)D and free\r
field theories [30, 31]. For lattice models in the quantum\r
critical region, especially two-dimensional models, there\r
is still much to explore.\r
In this paper, we study the effect of small rele\u0002vant deformations on the entangle for both one- and\r
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent\r
Lorentz invariance on the lattice. In one dimension,\r
we use the finite-entanglement scaling approach based\r
on the infinite matrix product state (MPS) representa\u0002tion [11, 32–34]. The finite length scale ξ in the MPS is\r
introduced by the entanglement cutoff. In two dimen\u0002sions, we use the correlation matrix technique [35] to\r

study the EE of free Dirac fermions. We consider rel\u0002evant deformations with or without U(1) symmetries to\r
the critical fermions. Combing the numerical calculations\r
and the scaling theory argument, we propose there is a\r
universal power-law correction in the EE induced by the\r
relevant deformation. After that we present our study\r
of critical points without Lorentz invariance. Finally we\r
give a summary and conclusion.\r
II. ENTANGLEMENT CORRECTION IN ONE\r
DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM CRITICAL POINTS\r
Before we present our study of the entanglement prop\u0002erties of (2+1)D theories, we investigate the influence of\r
relevant deformations in one-dimensional quantum crit\u0002ical points with a underlying (1+1)D CFT description.\r
Since we are going to use the infinite uniform matrix\r
product state (MPS) framework. [32, 34, 36] to study the\r
EE, the length scale therein is the correlation length ξ in\u0002duced by the entanglement cutoff. MPS is a generic class\r
of tensor network states describing low-energy states of\r
one-dimensional lattice models well. The bipartite EE\r
for critical the ground states is known to scale logarith\u0002mically with respect to the finite length scale of the sys\u0002tem S ∼\r
c\r
6\r
log(ξ) where the sub-region A is assumed\r
to the left half spin chain. We add a relevant operator\r
H′:= g Og to the Hamiltonian H0 at the critical point\r
and study the deviation of the logarithmic scaling for the\r
EE. Resembling the EE as a conventional physical quan\u0002tity (dimensionless), we expect the leading correction in\r
the EE may be of the form\r
δS ∼ g ξd+z−∆g(1)\r
where d = 1 is the space dimension, z = 1 denotes the\r
dynamical exponent, and ∆g is the scaling dimension of\r
Og.\r
We considered the quantum Ising chain\r
H =\r
X\r
i\r
(−ZiZi+1 − hXi) (2)\r
where Z and X are Pauli matrices defined on the two\u0002dimensional Hilbert space. The model has a global Z2\r
symmetry. There is a quantum phase transition in the\r
ground state at hc = 1 separating the symmetry-breaking\r
phase h < 1 and the symmetric phase when h > 1. At the\r
low energy, the critical Ising model is described by the\r
A-series minimal model M(4, 3) CFT [27]. There are two\r
non-trivial relevant operator for the Ising CFT, including\r
the spin and the energy operator. On the lattice they are\r
realized by adding a longitudinal field hz or deforming the\r
transverse field to hc + δh, respectively.\r
In Fig. 1, we show the correction for the entanglement\r
against the finite correlation length induced by adding\r
a small relevant field g = δh. The relevant deformation\r
is the energy operator ϵ with a scaling dimension ∆ϵ =\r
1. The correction of the EE shows a perfect power-law\r
behavior ξ\r
p with an exponent p ∼ 1.00. This is consistent\r
with the form Eq. 1. Interestingly, we notice that there\r
is a sign change for the EE correction term when adding\r
a positive δh > 0 or a negative δh < 0 deformation.\r
This is because the phase transition in the Ising model\r
is induced by the energy operator and there is a shift\r
for the critical point at finite length scales. Hence there\r
exists an imbalance distributions for the EE and other\r
physical quantities within the quantum critical region.\r
We also consider deforming the critical point with a\r
symmetry-breaking field H′ = hz\r
P\r
i Zi\r
. This lattice op\u0002erator realizes the spin operator σ with a scaling dimen\u0002sion ∆σ = 1/8 in the Ising CFT. The numerical results in\r
Fig. 2 confirm the power-law behavior and the exponent\r
p ∼ 1.88 is close to the exponent d + z − ∆σ = 15/8.\r
The power-law correction for the EE found in the nu\u0002merical calculation in Figs. 1 and 2 may be explained\r
from the scaling theory argument. One can regard the\r
EE or exponential of the EE as a physical quantity with

3\r
a dimension ∆ = 0 or ∆ = −1, respectively. The EE\r
close to the critical point can be written down as\r
S(g, ξ) ∼\r
c\r
6\r
log ξ f1(g ξd+z−∆g)\r
\u0001\r
, (3)\r
where the finite length scale ξ can be replaced by other\r
scales in different finite scaling approaches. Assuming a\r
small parameter g and the scaling function being smooth,\r
one can write down an approximated scaling theory up\r
to the leading correction\r
S(g, ξ) ∼\r
c\r
6\r
log(ξ) + cg gξd+z−∆g + O(g\r
2\r
) (4)\r
where cg is obtained from the expansion of the scaling\r
function and assumed to be non-zero. It predicts a uni\u0002versal power-law correction for the EE with an exponent\r
p = d + z − ∆g. This is consistent with our numerical\r
results in Fig. 1 by deforming the energy and the spin\r
operators.\r
III. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY\r
CORRECTION IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL FREE\r
LATTICE FERMIONS\r
In two dimensions, the underlying (2+1)D CFT [27] for\r
the critical lattice models is not as powerful as the one\u0002dimensional case. The numerical study of the EE is also\r
challenging for, e.g. tensor networks or quantum Monte\r
Carlo methods. Here we study the critical free lattice\r
fermion models, which are well under control numerically.\r
Thanks to the Wick theorem, the EE can be easily ob\u0002tained from the single-particle correlation function [35].\r
Note that since the fermion annihilation/creation opera\u0002tor has a scaling dimension ∆ = 1, the relevant operators\r
we can write down must be bi-linear fermion operators\r
with an even fermion parity.\r
A. Entanglement entropy in free Dirac fermions\r
In this section, we study the entanglement in criti\u0002cal free lattice fermion under small relevant perturba\u0002tions. The critical lattice model is described by the Dirac\r
fermion in the low energy. We consider L × L finite lat\u0002tices with periodic boundary conditions on both x and\r
y spatial directions. Two sub-regions A of different ge\u0002ometries are considered, either a L\r
2 × L cylinder without\r
corners or a L\r
2 ×\r
L\r
2\r
square with four corners. The EE\r
between the sub-region A and its rest part A¯ is calcu\u0002lated from the single-particle correlation defined within\r
the sub-region [35].\r
We consider the simplest lattice model that realizes\r
free Dirac fermions on the honeycomb lattice as shown\r
in Fig. 3 (a)\r
H = H0 + H′(5)\r

upper and lower layer are shown with solid and dash lines, re\u0002spectively. The inter-layer hopping ti connects different sub\u0002site A and B of each layer.\r

and H′ = g Og denotes a small relevant operator. The\r
gapless point g = 0 can be viewed as a fine-tuning quan\u0002tum critical point between the g > 0 and g < 0 gapped\r
phases. At the gapless point, there are two Dirac points\r
at the K and K′ points in the first Brillouin zone. The\r
number of Dirac points must be even for lattice mod\u0002els [37].\r
Without a finite fermi surface, the EE in the Dirac\r
fermion model satisfies an area law S ∼ αL. Similar to\r
the one-dimensional case, regarding the EE as a conven\u0002tional physical quantity, a power-law correction\r
δS ∼ gLd+z+1−∆g(7)\r
is expected. Interestingly, the gapped phases induced by\r
a relevant field g also satisfy an area law S ∼ αgL for the\r
EE at large length scales L ≫ ξg. One notices that it is\r
very different from the the one-dimensional case studied\r
in the last section, in which the EE satisfies different\r
scaling forms between the critical point and the gapped\r
phase. This makes the identification of the EE response\r
to a mall relevant field more challenging numerically in\r
two dimensions. Nevertheless, we expect that within the\r
quantum critical region L ≪ ξg, the correction in the EE\r
induced by the small relevant operator can be observed,\r
assuming the area law coefficient does not change much\r
for a small deformation.\r
1. The EE correction induced by a small mass deformation\r

vicinity of the Dirac fermion with a small deformation –\r

which stands for the on-site staggered chemical potential.\r
H′ opens a small energy gap 1/ξm at the Dirac points.\r
When m changes sign, an inversion of energy bands oc\u0002cur. The quantum critical region is well-defined for small\r
systems L ≪ ξm ∼ 1/|m|. The positive and negative m\r
regions are related by a unitary transformation, therefor\r
we only consider m > 0 in the following.\r
We first consider the sub-region A of a cylinder geome\u0002try with a smooth entangling surface. The area law term\r
should dominate the scaling for the EE. As expected, the\r
EE shows perfect area law in the quantum critical region.\r
Figure. 4 shows the scaling behavior of the leading cor\u0002rection\r
S\r
(1)(g, L) = S(g, L) − S(0, L) (9)\r
which satisfies a perfect power-law fitting. The exponent\r
found 1.94 is close to 2, consistent with the power-law\r
form L\r
d+z+1−∆m in which the mass term has a scaling\r
dimension ∆m = 2 for the free Dirac fermion.\r
Now we begin to study the sub-region A of a square\r
geometry with corners. As analysed above, the existence\r
of singularity points in the entangling surface leads to\r
another divergent logarithmic EE. To study the corner\r
contribution, one needs to properly subtract the area law\r
part. Here we define\r
S\r
c\r
(g, L) = |S(g, 2L) − 2S(g, L)| (10)\r
by using the 2L × 2L and L × L lattices [38]. Such a\r
logarithmic divergent term is accurately produced in the\r
finite size scaling, see Fig. 5 (a). Turing on a small mass\r
perturbation, one can also observe small deviations from\r
the logarithmic form at large lengths. This deviation sig\u0002nals the correction induced by the deformation. In Fig. 5\r
(b), we show the scaling of the correction S\r
(1)(g, L) de\u0002fined in Eq. 9. It also satisfies a perfect power-law fitting\r
with an exponent 1.95 which is also consistent with the\r
form L\r
d+z+1−∆m. The existence of corners in the sub\u0002region A does not change the leading correction by the\r
deformation. One may wonder the corner contribution\r
also contains a correction term with a smaller exponent.\r
It belongs to next leading contribution, which is beyond\r
the scope of the present research.\r
We have concentrated on the finite size scaling (L ≪ ξ)\r
approach so far. It is interesting that we can also use\r
a different way to study the logarithmic term S\r
c\r
(g, L).\r
For a given mass term, we first calculate the converged\r
value at the thermodynamic limit S\r
c\r
(g, L → ∞). The\r
inverse mass becomes the length scale, which can be used\r
to perform a finite mass scaling analysis. At the small\r
mass regime, the corner EE should behave like S\r
c\r
(m) ∼\r
log(1/m). This is verified in Fig. 6, where the numerical\r
data shows an accurate finite mass scaling behavior.\r

2. The EE correction induced by a small pairing\r
deformation\r
In the previous subsection, we have shown that a U(1)\r
symmetric mass term could contribute to a universal\r
power-law correction. Here we switch to an s-wave pair\u0002ing (superconducting) deformation\r
H′ = g\r

. (11)\r
where g is small. It has the same scaling dimension as the\r
mass term ∆g = 2. This superconducting term breaks\r
the global U(1) symmetry and results in a fully gapped\r
superconductor ground state. The s-wave pairing ensures\r
a small energy gap opening exactly at the Dirac points.

5\r
When g changes sign, the single particle energy band also\r
inverses, in which the vacuum ground state becomes fully\r
occupied state. The two phases are related by a canon\u0002ical transformation. Note that there is no global U(1)\r
symmetry, the correlation matrix should also include the\r
correlation function for the annihilation (creation) oper\u0002ators.\r
We first study the EE correction for the sub-region of\r
a cylinder geometry. As shown in Fig.7, the correction\r
term induced by a small pairing deformation shows a\r
power-law behavior accurately. The exponent is found to\r
be 1.96, which is again consistent with the scaling form\r
L\r
d+z+1−∆g\r
.\r
Next we consider the sub-region of the square geome\u0002try. The numerical results for the Sc is shown in Fig. 8.\r
It shows a perfect logarithmic scaling behavior. Again,\r
turning small pairing deformations, one can see there are\r
deviations from the perfect logarithmic scaling. The cor\u0002rection in the EE induced by the deformation shows an\r
accurately power-law behavior, see Fig. 8 (b). The expo\u0002nent is fitted to be δg ∼ 1.94 is again consistent with the\r
scaling form Eq. 7.\r
B. Scaling theory for the universal correction in\r
(2+1)D quantum critical point\r
Here we give a scaling theory argument to the power\u0002law correction term found in the numerical calculations.\r
In (2+1)D the EE for critical theories with conformal\r
symmetry satisfy the area law for a sub-region with a\r
smooth entangling surface. With a small relevant defor\u0002mation g Oˆ\r
g to the critical point, we conjecture a scaling\r
theory for the EE\r
S(g, L) ∼ L f g Ld+z−∆g\r

FIG. 7. Power-law correction of the EE induced by a small\r

fitting (dashed line). The sub-region is of a cylinder geometry.\r
the scaling function f to be smooth and a small enough\r
perturbation g, one maybe expands the scaling theory in\r
terms of g\r
S(g, L) ∼ S(0, L) + a1 g Ld+z+1−∆g + O(g\r
2\r
) (13)\r
where S(0, L) ∼ a0L is the leading area law contribu\u0002tion. This gives rise to the universal power-law correc\u0002tion in Eq. 7. Such a universal correction can be detected\r
when the length scale is much smaller than the correla\u0002tion length, L ≪ ξg. It should be noted that this leading\r
correction relies on a non-zero expansion constant a1.\r
The power-law correction shown above may disappear\r
and the leading correction comes from one order higher\r
expansion O(g\r
2\r
) when c1 disappears accidentally.\r
The EE distribution may become more complicated\r
if the entangling surface contains singular points. It\r
is known that a singular corner in the sub-region con\u0002tributes an extra logarithmic divergent term log(L) com\u0002pared with those with a smooth entangling surface. Thus\r
when the entangling surface contains corners, one may\r
rewrite the EE as\r
S(g, L) = a0L + ac log(L) + a1gLd+z+1−∆g + O(g\r
2\r
)\r
(14)\r
where only leading corrections are considered. There may\r
exist a power-law correction term from the corner contri\u0002bution, which has a smaller exponent, hence difficult to\r
demonstrate in numerical simulations.\r
Besides critical theories with emergent conformal sym\u0002metry, we are also interested in critical points without\r
emergent Lorentz invariance, z > 1, at the low-energy\r
limit. We expect the scaling theory, especially the EE\r
correction in Eqs. 9 and 7 hold when the dynamical ex\u0002ponent is close to that in Lorentz invariant systems z ∼ 1.

C. Entanglement entropy in critical fermions\r
without Lorentz invariance\r
The critical lattice models studied above admit Lorentz\r
invariance (z = 1) at the low energy. From the scaling ar\u0002gument, this is not a necessary requirement in principle.\r
For free fermions, a non-integer dynamical exponent is\r
usually realized in models with long-range hoppings. For\r
simplicity, here we study critical free lattice fermions with\r
a dynamical exponent z = 2, whose low-energy modes\r
read ω ∼ k\r
2\r
. Note that the scaling dimension of the\r
fermionic annihilation operator ψ does not rely on the\r
value of z. A simple dimension counting gives ∆ψ = 1\r
for the free fermion in two dimensions. In the following,\r
we are going to rely on numerical analysis to study the\r

term m = 0.001 for different inter-layer hoppings.\r
EE.\r
We consider the bernal-stacked bi-layer graphene 3\r
with both intra- (t = 1) and inter-layer (ti) hoppings.\r
The model admits two quadratic band touching points\r
when ti ̸= 0, which results in a dynamical exponent\r
z = 2 at the low-energy. Deforming the critical model\r
by adding a staggered mass term m in both layers opens\r
a small energy gap at the band-touching points. A sim\u0002ple dimensional counting tells that the scaling dimension\r
of the relevant operator is ∆m = 2. The leading EE\r
correction is thus expected to be the form of δS ∼ mL3.\r
Figure. 9 shows the EE for a given inter-layer hopping\r
ti = 0.3. It turns out the EE shows similar behavior as\r
that in the Lorentz invariant theories. The corner contri\u0002bution S\r
c\r
satisfies a logarithmic scaling for this model.\r
Turning on the small mass deformation, it becomes de\u0002viated from the logarithmic form. Moreover, the leading\r
correction induced by the small mass deformation is of\r
a power-law form. However, the exponent is fitted to\r
be ∼ 3.6, which does not fit in with the scaling form\r
L\r
d+z+1−∆m. We also check the power-law correction for\r
different inter-layer hopping ti. Figure. 10 demonstrates\r
that S\r
c\r
remains to be a power-law form with the same\r
exponent. Considering the fact that, the space-time di\u0002mension and the dimension of the fermion operators are\r
all integers, this is a surprising result. The scaling argu\u0002ment does not apply here. In a different model, the free\r
fermion model on the square lattice with a flux [39, 40],\r
we find the power-law correction due to the variation of\r
the flux gives an power-law correction for the EE, which\r
again can not be explained by the scaling argument.\r
These results indicate that, small relevant deforma\u0002tions indeed induce a power-law correction term for the\r
EE in non-Lorentz invariant critical points. However, the\r
power-law correction term may not be universal in the\r
sense that its exponent is not determined by the scal\u0002ing dimension ∆ of the relevant operator in the form\r
of L\r
d+z+a−∆ and the exponent may change in different\r
models. In our studies, the models have a dynamical

7\r
exponent z = 2, which is a strongly anisotropic critical\r
point and can be described by the so-called conformal\r
quantum critical point [41, 42]. The overlap of its ground\r
state wave function with itself usually results in a parti\u0002tion function of a (1+1)D CFT. The scaling for the corner\r
EE may be related to that in the (1+1)D CFT [42]. How\u0002ever, the correspondence between the relevant operator\r
we added in the two-dimensional lattice model and op\u0002erators in (1+1)D CFT can be complicated. Identifying\r
the non-trivial correspondence may be helpful to explain\r
the non-universal exponent in the power-law correction\r
term.\r
IV. SUMMARY\r
In this paper, we studied the bipartite EE induced by\r
a small relevant deformation to Lorentz invariant quan\u0002tum critical points in both one and two dimensions. We\r
argue that, within the quantum critical region small rele\u0002vant deformations at the critical point induce a universal\r
power-law correction to the EE. The exponent for this\r
term is determined by the scaling dimension of the rel\u0002evant operator. We applied numerical simulations and\r
scaling argument to verify the universal correction term.\r
In one dimension, we used the finite entanglement scaling\r
to study critical lattice models and confirm the universal\r
power-law correction to the leading logarithmic scaling\r
for the EE. In two dimensions, we studied the critical lat\u0002tice free fermion models which is described by the Dirac\r
fermion at the low energy. We utilized the correlation\r
matrix method to calculate the EE. With different types\r
of relevant deformations, the universal pow-law correc\u0002tion is verified and its exponent is also determined by\r
the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. We also\r
studied the corner contribution in the EE. The logarith\u0002mic contribution by the singularity point in the entan\u0002gling surface is confirmed with two different scaling ap\u0002proaches. We also studied non-Lorentz invariant critical\r
models with a dynamical exponent z = 2. The pow-law\r
correction for the EE induced by small relevant deforma\u0002tions is also found. However, such a power-law correction\r
may not be universal.\r
The models studied here in two dimensions are free\r
fermion models. We expect the universal power-law cor\u0002rection to hold for non-trivial quantum critical points in\r
interacting models, where there are anomalous correction\r
to the dimension of relevant operators. In addition, there\r
would be shift for the critical point at finite length scales.\r
We expect there exists a sign change for the EE univer\u0002sal correction term at two different sides of the critical\r
point. It is also interesting to further study EE in non\u0002Lorentz invariant models at the special point z = 2 from\r
the (1+1)D CFT viewpoint. Another interesting topic\r
is to study the correction for the EE for critical points\r
close to the Lorentz invariant point z ∼ 1. We leave these\r
interesting topics for future studies.\r

Local relevant deformations are important tool to study universal properties of quantum critical\r
points. We investigate the effect of small relevant deformations on the bi-partite entanglement\r
entropy at the quantum critical points. Within the quantum critical region, a universal power-law\r
correction in the entanglement entropy induced by the relevant operator is found in both one- and\r
two-dimensional critical lattice models. The exponent of the power-law correction term is determined\r
by the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. Based on numerical simulations and scaling theory\r
argument, it is conjectured that such a universal power-law correction in the entanglement entropy\r
is universal for Lorentz invariant quantum critical points. Without Lorentz invariance, it is found\r
the exponent in the power-law correction term does not fit in with the scaling argument in models\r
with a dynamical exponent z = 2 in two dimension. This may be because the relevant operator\r
added in the lattice model corresponds to complicated operators in the corresponding conformal\r
field theory. Our study provides a different perspective to extract universal information of quantum\r
critical points. We expect it would be useful to detect unique properties of topological quantum\r
phase transitions.\r
I. INTRODUCTION\r
Along with the recent fast development of quantum\r
computing technologies, the study and understanding\r
of quantum entanglement becomes one of the most im\u0002portant topics. As a key concept in quantum theo\u0002ries, the entanglement has already inspired many re\u0002searches for both high energy and condensed matter\r
physics in recent years. The measure of the amount of\r
quantum entanglement, the entanglement entropy (EE)\r
S := −tr (ρA log(ρA)) (ρA is the reduced density matrix\r
for the sub-region A in the whole system) deepens our un\u0002derstanding of quantum matter in many aspects [1–22],\r
especially in the study of gapped quantum phases. The\r
famous area law for the EE in gapped ground states not\r
only reveals the relation between degrees of freedom in a\r
quantum system [1–3], but also inspired novel quantum\r
many-body frameworks [4–6].Moreover, a finer structure\r
of the entanglement, including the degeneracy in the en\u0002tanglement spectrum and the long-range entanglement,\r
becomes the key to classify gapped topological quantum\r
phases [4, 7–11].\r
The entanglement scaling is also found important ap\u0002plications in critical systems [12–26]. The logarithmic\r
scaling of the EE becomes one of the canonical methods\r
to identify one-dimensional quantum critical points and\r
extract the central charge for the underlying conformal\r
field theory (CFT) [3, 12–15]. For two-dimensional quan\u0002tum critical points, the corner EE is found to be related\r
to Goldstone modes and is utilized to diagnose a class of\r
controversial quantum phase transitions [23, 24]. Despite\r
these successful applications of entanglement in critical-\r
∗ pengchen@ucas.ac.cn\r
ity, the information of the fixed point is not included\r
there. For example, one can extract the central charge\r
from the scaling the EE, however there may be different\r
CFTs with the same central charge [27, 28]. A natural\r
question is thus how one can find universal data from\r
the EE. Recently it is found in one dimensions, the en\u0002tanglement spectrum can be used to detect the operator\r
contents of the corresponding CFT in some cases, pro\u0002vided with some other input information [15, 25, 26, 29].\r
For two-dimensional universalities, or even more general\r
cases without emergent Lorentz invariance, it is still an\r
open question.\r
From the scaling theory viewpoint, the universal scal\u0002ing form of the EE [3] at the quantum critical point al\u0002lows one to resemble local physical quantities and re\u0002gard it as a quantity with a scaling dimension. For\r
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent\r
Lorentz invariance, such as the two-dimensional critical\r
quantum Ising model on the square lattice, the EE sat\u0002isfies an area law. One may expect close to the quantum\r
critical point, a scaling theory may be written down for\r
the EE and its deviation from the area law be universal.\r
There has already been research in this area, primarily\r
focusing on conformal field theory in (1+1)D and free\r
field theories [30, 31]. For lattice models in the quantum\r
critical region, especially two-dimensional models, there\r
is still much to explore.\r
In this paper, we study the effect of small rele\u0002vant deformations on the entangle for both one- and\r
two-dimensional quantum critical points with emergent\r
Lorentz invariance on the lattice. In one dimension,\r
we use the finite-entanglement scaling approach based\r
on the infinite matrix product state (MPS) representa\u0002tion [11, 32–34]. The finite length scale ξ in the MPS is\r
introduced by the entanglement cutoff. In two dimen\u0002sions, we use the correlation matrix technique [35] to\r

study the EE of free Dirac fermions. We consider rel\u0002evant deformations with or without U(1) symmetries to\r
the critical fermions. Combing the numerical calculations\r
and the scaling theory argument, we propose there is a\r
universal power-law correction in the EE induced by the\r
relevant deformation. After that we present our study\r
of critical points without Lorentz invariance. Finally we\r
give a summary and conclusion.\r
II. ENTANGLEMENT CORRECTION IN ONE\r
DIMENSIONAL QUANTUM CRITICAL POINTS\r
Before we present our study of the entanglement prop\u0002erties of (2+1)D theories, we investigate the influence of\r
relevant deformations in one-dimensional quantum crit\u0002ical points with a underlying (1+1)D CFT description.\r
Since we are going to use the infinite uniform matrix\r
product state (MPS) framework. [32, 34, 36] to study the\r
EE, the length scale therein is the correlation length ξ in\u0002duced by the entanglement cutoff. MPS is a generic class\r
of tensor network states describing low-energy states of\r
one-dimensional lattice models well. The bipartite EE\r
for critical the ground states is known to scale logarith\u0002mically with respect to the finite length scale of the sys\u0002tem S ∼\r
c\r
6\r
log(ξ) where the sub-region A is assumed\r
to the left half spin chain. We add a relevant operator\r
H′:= g Og to the Hamiltonian H0 at the critical point\r
and study the deviation of the logarithmic scaling for the\r
EE. Resembling the EE as a conventional physical quan\u0002tity (dimensionless), we expect the leading correction in\r
the EE may be of the form\r
δS ∼ g ξd+z−∆g(1)\r
where d = 1 is the space dimension, z = 1 denotes the\r
dynamical exponent, and ∆g is the scaling dimension of\r
Og.\r
We considered the quantum Ising chain\r
H =\r
X\r
i\r
(−ZiZi+1 − hXi) (2)\r
where Z and X are Pauli matrices defined on the two\u0002dimensional Hilbert space. The model has a global Z2\r
symmetry. There is a quantum phase transition in the\r
ground state at hc = 1 separating the symmetry-breaking\r
phase h < 1 and the symmetric phase when h > 1. At the\r
low energy, the critical Ising model is described by the\r
A-series minimal model M(4, 3) CFT [27]. There are two\r
non-trivial relevant operator for the Ising CFT, including\r
the spin and the energy operator. On the lattice they are\r
realized by adding a longitudinal field hz or deforming the\r
transverse field to hc + δh, respectively.\r
In Fig. 1, we show the correction for the entanglement\r

a small relevant field g = δh. The relevant deformation\r

p with an exponent p ∼ 1.00. This is consistent\r
with the form Eq. 1. Interestingly, we notice that there\r
is a sign change for the EE correction term when adding\r
a positive δh > 0 or a negative δh < 0 deformation.\r
This is because the phase transition in the Ising model\r
is induced by the energy operator and there is a shift\r
for the critical point at finite length scales. Hence there\r
exists an imbalance distributions for the EE and other\r
physical quantities within the quantum critical region.\r

. This lattice op\u0002erator realizes the spin operator σ with a scaling dimen\u0002sion ∆σ = 1/8 in the Ising CFT. The numerical results in\r
Fig. 2 confirm the power-law behavior and the exponent\r
p ∼ 1.88 is close to the exponent d + z − ∆σ = 15/8.\r
The power-law correction for the EE found in the nu\u0002merical calculation in Figs. 1 and 2 may be explained\r
from the scaling theory argument. One can regard the\r
EE or exponential of the EE as a physical quantity with

3\r
a dimension ∆ = 0 or ∆ = −1, respectively. The EE\r
close to the critical point can be written down as\r
S(g, ξ) ∼\r

log ξ f1(g ξd+z−∆g)\r
\u0001\r
, (3)\r
where the finite length scale ξ can be replaced by other\r
scales in different finite scaling approaches. Assuming a\r
small parameter g and the scaling function being smooth,\r
one can write down an approximated scaling theory up\r
to the leading correction\r
S(g, ξ) ∼\r

log(ξ) + cg gξd+z−∆g + O(g\r

where cg is obtained from the expansion of the scaling\r
function and assumed to be non-zero. It predicts a uni\u0002versal power-law correction for the EE with an exponent\r
p = d + z − ∆g. This is consistent with our numerical\r
results in Fig. 1 by deforming the energy and the spin\r
operators.\r
III. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY\r
CORRECTION IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL FREE\r
LATTICE FERMIONS\r
In two dimensions, the underlying (2+1)D CFT [27] for\r
the critical lattice models is not as powerful as the one\u0002dimensional case. The numerical study of the EE is also\r
challenging for, e.g. tensor networks or quantum Monte\r
Carlo methods. Here we study the critical free lattice\r
fermion models, which are well under control numerically.\r
Thanks to the Wick theorem, the EE can be easily ob\u0002tained from the single-particle correlation function [35].\r
Note that since the fermion annihilation/creation opera\u0002tor has a scaling dimension ∆ = 1, the relevant operators\r
we can write down must be bi-linear fermion operators\r
with an even fermion parity.\r
A. Entanglement entropy in free Dirac fermions\r
In this section, we study the entanglement in criti\u0002cal free lattice fermion under small relevant perturba\u0002tions. The critical lattice model is described by the Dirac\r
fermion in the low energy. We consider L × L finite lat\u0002tices with periodic boundary conditions on both x and\r
y spatial directions. Two sub-regions A of different ge\u0002ometries are considered, either a L\r
2 × L cylinder without\r
corners or a L\r
2 ×\r
L\r
2\r
square with four corners. The EE\r
between the sub-region A and its rest part A¯ is calcu\u0002lated from the single-particle correlation defined within\r
the sub-region [35].\r
We consider the simplest lattice model that realizes\r
free Dirac fermions on the honeycomb lattice as shown\r
in Fig. 3 (a)\r
H = H0 + H′(5)\r

and H′ = g Og denotes a small relevant operator. The\r
gapless point g = 0 can be viewed as a fine-tuning quan\u0002tum critical point between the g > 0 and g < 0 gapped\r
phases. At the gapless point, there are two Dirac points\r
at the K and K′ points in the first Brillouin zone. The\r
number of Dirac points must be even for lattice mod\u0002els [37].\r
Without a finite fermi surface, the EE in the Dirac\r
fermion model satisfies an area law S ∼ αL. Similar to\r
the one-dimensional case, regarding the EE as a conven\u0002tional physical quantity, a power-law correction\r
δS ∼ gLd+z+1−∆g(7)\r
is expected. Interestingly, the gapped phases induced by\r
a relevant field g also satisfy an area law S ∼ αgL for the\r
EE at large length scales L ≫ ξg. One notices that it is\r
very different from the the one-dimensional case studied\r
in the last section, in which the EE satisfies different\r
scaling forms between the critical point and the gapped\r
phase. This makes the identification of the EE response\r
to a mall relevant field more challenging numerically in\r
two dimensions. Nevertheless, we expect that within the\r
quantum critical region L ≪ ξg, the correction in the EE\r
induced by the small relevant operator can be observed,\r
assuming the area law coefficient does not change much\r
for a small deformation."""

systems L ≪ ξm ∼ 1/|m|. The positive and negative m\r
regions are related by a unitary transformation, therefor\r
we only consider m > 0 in the following.\r
We first consider the sub-region A of a cylinder geome\u0002try with a smooth entangling surface. The area law term\r
should dominate the scaling for the EE. As expected, the\r
EE shows perfect area law in the quantum critical region.\r
Figure. 4 shows the scaling behavior of the leading cor\u0002rection\r
S\r
(1)(g, L) = S(g, L) − S(0, L) (9)\r
which satisfies a perfect power-law fitting. The exponent\r
found 1.94 is close to 2, consistent with the power-law\r
form L\r
d+z+1−∆m in which the mass term has a scaling\r
dimension ∆m = 2 for the free Dirac fermion.\r
Now we begin to study the sub-region A of a square\r
geometry with corners. As analysed above, the existence\r
of singularity points in the entangling surface leads to\r
another divergent logarithmic EE. To study the corner\r
contribution, one needs to properly subtract the area law\r
part. Here we define\r
S\r
c\r
(g, L) = |S(g, 2L) − 2S(g, L)| (10)\r
by using the 2L × 2L and L × L lattices [38]. Such a\r
logarithmic divergent term is accurately produced in the\r
finite size scaling, see Fig. 5 (a). Turing on a small mass\r
perturbation, one can also observe small deviations from\r
the logarithmic form at large lengths. This deviation sig\u0002nals the correction induced by the deformation. In Fig. 5\r
(b), we show the scaling of the correction S\r
(1)(g, L) de\u0002fined in Eq. 9. It also satisfies a perfect power-law fitting\r
with an exponent 1.95 which is also consistent with the\r
form L\r
d+z+1−∆m. The existence of corners in the sub\u0002region A does not change the leading correction by the\r
deformation. One may wonder the corner contribution\r
also contains a correction term with a smaller exponent.\r
It belongs to next leading contribution, which is beyond\r
the scope of the present research.\r
We have concentrated on the finite size scaling (L ≪ ξ)\r
approach so far. It is interesting that we can also use\r
a different way to study the logarithmic term S\r
c\r
(g, L).\r
For a given mass term, we first calculate the converged\r
value at the thermodynamic limit S\r
c\r
(g, L → ∞). The\r
inverse mass becomes the length scale, which can be used\r
to perform a finite mass scaling analysis. At the small\r
mass regime, the corner EE should behave like S\r
c\r
(m) ∼\r
log(1/m). This is verified in Fig. 6, where the numerical\r
data shows an accurate finite mass scaling behavior.\r

deviations from the perfect logarithmic scaling. The cor\u0002rection in the EE induced by the deformation shows an\r

when the length scale is much smaller than the correla\u0002tion length, L ≪ ξg. It should be noted that this leading\r

exist a power-law correction term from the corner contri\u0002bution, which has a smaller exponent, hence difficult to\r

Besides critical theories with emergent conformal sym\u0002metry, we are also interested in critical points without\r
emergent Lorentz invariance, z > 1, at the low-energy\r

EE.\r
We consider the bernal-stacked bi-layer graphene 3\r
with both intra- (t = 1) and inter-layer (ti) hoppings.\r
The model admits two quadratic band touching points\r
when ti ̸= 0, which results in a dynamical exponent\r
z = 2 at the low-energy. Deforming the critical model\r
by adding a staggered mass term m in both layers opens\r
a small energy gap at the band-touching points. A sim\u0002ple dimensional counting tells that the scaling dimension\r
of the relevant operator is ∆m = 2. The leading EE\r
correction is thus expected to be the form of δS ∼ mL3.\r
Figure. 9 shows the EE for a given inter-layer hopping\r
ti = 0.3. It turns out the EE shows similar behavior as\r
that in the Lorentz invariant theories. The corner contri\u0002bution S\r
c\r
satisfies a logarithmic scaling for this model.\r
Turning on the small mass deformation, it becomes de\u0002viated from the logarithmic form. Moreover, the leading\r
correction induced by the small mass deformation is of\r
a power-law form. However, the exponent is fitted to\r
be ∼ 3.6, which does not fit in with the scaling form\r
L\r
d+z+1−∆m. We also check the power-law correction for\r
different inter-layer hopping ti. Figure. 10 demonstrates\r
that S\r
c\r
remains to be a power-law form with the same\r
exponent. Considering the fact that, the space-time di\u0002mension and the dimension of the fermion operators are\r
all integers, this is a surprising result. The scaling argu\u0002ment does not apply here. In a different model, the free\r
fermion model on the square lattice with a flux [39, 40],\r
we find the power-law correction due to the variation of\r
the flux gives an power-law correction for the EE, which\r
again can not be explained by the scaling argument.\r
These results indicate that, small relevant deforma\u0002tions indeed induce a power-law correction term for the\r
EE in non-Lorentz invariant critical points. However, the\r
power-law correction term may not be universal in the\r
sense that its exponent is not determined by the scal\u0002ing dimension ∆ of the relevant operator in the form\r
of L\r
d+z+a−∆ and the exponent may change in different\r
models. In our studies, the models have a dynamical

7\r
exponent z = 2, which is a strongly anisotropic critical\r
point and can be described by the so-called conformal\r
quantum critical point [41, 42]. The overlap of its ground\r
state wave function with itself usually results in a parti\u0002tion function of a (1+1)D CFT. The scaling for the corner\r
EE may be related to that in the (1+1)D CFT [42]. How\u0002ever, the correspondence between the relevant operator\r
we added in the two-dimensional lattice model and op\u0002erators in (1+1)D CFT can be complicated. Identifying\r
the non-trivial correspondence may be helpful to explain\r
the non-universal exponent in the power-law correction\r
term.\r
IV. SUMMARY\r
In this paper, we studied the bipartite EE induced by\r
a small relevant deformation to Lorentz invariant quan\u0002tum critical points in both one and two dimensions. We\r
argue that, within the quantum critical region small rele\u0002vant deformations at the critical point induce a universal\r
power-law correction to the EE. The exponent for this\r
term is determined by the scaling dimension of the rel\u0002evant operator. We applied numerical simulations and\r
scaling argument to verify the universal correction term.\r
In one dimension, we used the finite entanglement scaling\r
to study critical lattice models and confirm the universal\r
power-law correction to the leading logarithmic scaling\r
for the EE. In two dimensions, we studied the critical lat\u0002tice free fermion models which is described by the Dirac\r
fermion at the low energy. We utilized the correlation\r
matrix method to calculate the EE. With different types\r
of relevant deformations, the universal pow-law correc\u0002tion is verified and its exponent is also determined by\r
the scaling dimension of the relevant operator. We also\r
studied the corner contribution in the EE. The logarith\u0002mic contribution by the singularity point in the entan\u0002gling surface is confirmed with two different scaling ap\u0002proaches. We also studied non-Lorentz invariant critical\r
models with a dynamical exponent z = 2. The pow-law\r
correction for the EE induced by small relevant deforma\u0002tions is also found. However, such a power-law correction\r
may not be universal.\r
The models studied here in two dimensions are free\r
fermion models. We expect the universal power-law cor\u0002rection to hold for non-trivial quantum critical points in\r
interacting models, where there are anomalous correction\r
to the dimension of relevant operators. In addition, there\r
would be shift for the critical point at finite length scales.\r
We expect there exists a sign change for the EE univer\u0002sal correction term at two different sides of the critical\r
point. It is also interesting to further study EE in non\u0002Lorentz invariant models at the special point z = 2 from\r
the (1+1)D CFT viewpoint. Another interesting topic\r
is to study the correction for the EE for critical points\r
close to the Lorentz invariant point z ∼ 1. We leave these\r
interesting topics for future studies.\r
