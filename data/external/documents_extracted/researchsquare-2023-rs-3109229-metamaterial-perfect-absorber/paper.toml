ABSTRACT\r
We report a multi-resonant THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor in the working frequency\r
range of 0.2 to 4THz for the sensing of microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and pesticides. Nearly\r
100% absorption is realized at f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz. To obtain optimum\r
performance of the MPA, a mapping of amplitudes and shifts in the absorption resonance peaks with\r
different structural parameters of the resonators is carried out. Investigations of the effect of the\r
incidence angle of the THz wave on the absorption spectra of the MPA is also carried out. It is found\r
that incidence angle does not impact the stability of the lower resonance absorption peak (1.79T Hz). To\r
better understand the mechanism of MPA, an equivalent circuit model using Advance Design System\r
(ADS) software is developed. The calculated results through the model show similar trends as obtained in\r
the simulations using CST. A significant frequency shift in the resonances is obtained with the application\r
of microorganisms such as Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi), yeast, and pesticides (Imidacloprid, N,\r
N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt\r
hydrate, and Dicofol) as testing analytes. The THz MPA-based biosensor has great potential to detect a\r
very small change in the effective dielectric constant of the MPA environment therefore it can offer huge\r
opportunities in label-free biosensing for future biomedical applications.\r
Introduction\r
Sensors are vital part of modern technology due to their applications in imaging, medicine, food quality\r
control, agriculture, defence, etc. Food safety and security, two foremost public health concerns1–3,\r
require fast and non-destructive inspection techniques. Due to fingerprints of pesticide and antibiotics in\r
terahertz (THz) spectral range4, 5, THz spectroscopy facilitates non-contact, label-free, non-destructive\r
inspection for food safety and control6–11. Moreover, the detection of microorganisms such as bacteria,\r
viruses, and fungi is also very important for food security12. However, due to the typical size of λ/100,\r
microorganisms are transparent at THz frequency leading to low scattering cross-section and are difficult\r
to detect by the THz spectroscopy13. To overcome this constraint, metamaterial-based THz sensors have\r
been proposed for the detection of microorganisms like bacteria, yeast, and molds14, where metamaterial\r
resonators are designed in such a way that the gap area of resonators becomes compatible with the size of\r
microorganisms. Here, the resonance frequency of metamaterials is extremely sensitive to any changes\r
in the dielectric constant of the gap area of the resonator15, 16. Presently, extensive research is being\r
carried out to develop metamaterial-based resonant devices such as modulators, sensors, polarization\r
conversion devices, absorbers, etc.17–19. Among these devices, metamaterial perfect absorbers (MPAs)\r
have fascinated worldwide attention due to their excellent performance and their potential applications20, 21.

MPAs are able to minimize the reflectivity and transmissivity close to zero. To further expand the\r
application prospects of MPAs, the number of absorption frequency peaks and workable frequency bands\r
need to be broadened. Several reports show that flexibility to work in a wide range of frequency band\r
can be obtained by optimizing the dimensions of MPAs22–28. Zamzam et. al29 designed an MPA with\r
a metal-dielectric-metal multi-layer column with different heights of the dielectric layer, where they\r
achieved two absorption peaks. Wang et. al30 demonstrate a triple-band terahertz metamaterial absorber\r
at 0.337, 0.496, and 0.718THz where they used three concentric square ring resonators. A metamaterial\r
absorber consisting of three closed circular ring resonators on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate is\r
investigated by Abdulkarim et. al31. The absorption mechanism was comprehensively investigated through\r
parametric studies, where a Q-factor of 50.72 and a maximum sensitivity of 149.5 GHz/RIU were reported.\r
Meng et. al demonstrated a multi-band terahertz absorber made of periodic square metallic ribbon with a\r
T-shaped gap. Several resonator structures like square spiral shape32, SSRR( square split ring resonator)33,\r
Jerusalem Cross34 , CSRR (Circular split ring resonator)35, eight-resistive arm cell36, and Ring C-shape\r
quasi-MMA37 have been investigated. Most of the reported THz meta-sensors suffer from the limitations\r
such as larger unit cell size, one or two absorption peaks, low absorption coefficients, and polarization\r
sensitivity. In this paper, we report a THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor that shows almost\r
100% absorption in the THz frequency range for fast and non-destructive detection of microorganisms like\r
molds, yeast cells, fungi, and pesticides. We observe multi-resonant (four) peaks in the frequency range\r
of 0.1 - 3.8 THz. We carried out detailed simulations to study the sensing performance of the proposed\r
sensor. A significant frequency shift in the inductive-capacitive resonance is obtained with the application\r
of microorganisms. A mapping of shifts in the resonance peaks of MPA with structural parameters is\r
carried out. Multi-resonant MPA-based THz biosensors are remarkably desirable for label-free biosensing\r
of a family of microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, molds, etc.). The proposed sensor is extremely suitable for\r
the detection of pesticides because their specific absorption fingerprint lie in the frequency range of 0.1 to\r
3 THz.\r
Design and analysis of MPA based sensor\r
We investigate several metastructures consisting of 1) only one stripe resonator, 2) two stripes resonator,\r
3) two stripes and one square resonator (SR), 4) two stripes and two SRs, and 5) two stripes and 1 open\r
book-like resonator (designed from putting two SRs obliquely) on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) substrate\r
(dielectric constant 12.96) for MPA based sensor (Fig.1). GaAs substrate is selected due to its high band\r
gap, high breakdown voltage, and better heat & moisture resistivity. A thick gold layer on the lower side\r
of the substrate as a ground plane is used to suppress the transmission of the THz signal. We select gold\r
due to its high conductivity, which causes inductance and capacitance to produce resonance at the desired\r
frequency.\r
The highest absorption coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure, where oblique\r
sheets offer the ability to manipulate the bandwidth of MPA leading to different resonance conditions\r
and different optical paths for resonances38. Sensor parameters of an open book-type metastructure\r
are optimized as: periodicity (P) = 70µm, substrate thickness (ts) = 15µm, width of metal stripes\r
(ws) = 4.5µm, length of metal stripes (Ls) = 50µm, gap between the metal stripes (G) = 40µm, the\r
thickness of ground metallic plane (tm) = 0.08µm, length(L) and width(w) of the open book resonator\r
= 20µm and 15µm, g = 5µm respectively. A plane electromagnetic wave(THz) polarized along the x-axis\r
is used to illuminate the proposed device. We applied unit cell boundary conditions in the x- and y\u0002directions, while the THz beam is incident normally along the z-direction. The schematic of MPA - based\r
sensor with incident, reflected, and absorbed THz beam is shown in figure 1(f). Simulations are carried\r

sensor with incident, reflected, and absorbed THz beam\r
out using commercial software CST Microwave Studio Suite in the frequency domain. A finite element\r
method-based algorithm is employed to obtain precise simulation results. To assure minimum reflection\r

of THz beam from metamaterial surface (R(ω) = S\r
2\r
11), a perfect impedance matching with air intrinsic\r
impedance (Zo) (where real and imaginary parts of Z(Ω) are close to 1 and 0 respectively) is obtained.\r
To suppress the transmission of THz wave through MPA to zero, a metallic ground plane on the bottom\r
side of substrate (T(ω) = S\r

21 = 0) is used. We obtain four absorption peaks in the frequency range 0.1 to\r
3.7T Hz with almost 100% absorptivity. The absorption frequencies are calculated as\r

To better understand the absorption behavior, we thoroughly investigate the effect of structural\r
parameters on the resonance frequencies. 2D colormaps in Fig. 2 show the effect of variation of length\r
of the stripe (Ls), the width of the stripes (ws), width and position of the open book resonator on the\r
absorption coefficient. The value of Ls\r
is varied from 20µm to 50µm as shown in Figure 2(a). Due to\r
the increase in inductance and capacitance of metallic stripes with an increase in Ls\r
, a redshift in the\r
resonances are observed with the increase in Ls. The maximum absorption is obtained at Ls = 50µm.\r
The effect of the width of the metal stripe (ws) (from 4µm to 10µm) on the absorption coefficient is\r
shown in Figure 2(b). The absorption coefficients for all four resonances become unity at ws = 4.5µm,\r
which starts decreasing with an increase in ws\r
, which is due to enhancement in the size of metallic\r
resonators leading to high reflections. We also investigate the effect of the w parameter (width of open\r
book type SRs from w = 5−30µm) on the absorption performances of the MPA(Figure 2(c)). We obtain\r
the highest absorption for w = 15µm without any shift in the resonance frequencies. Figure 2(d) shows\r
the effect of the length of SRs (for L = 10 to 50µm) on resonance frequencies and absorption coefficients.\r
It is found that the absorption coefficient decreases with the increase in the length of the open book due to\r
high reflections. MPA gives the highest absorption for L = 20µm and zero absorption for L = 50µm.\r

Equivalent circuit model of MPA using Advance Design System (ADS)\r
To better understand the absorption mechanism of the proposed MPA, an equivalent lumped circuit has\r
been designed using ASD -2019 simulation software (Figure 3), where unit cell of MPA has four resonators\r
i.e. two metal stripes and two SRs as shown in Figure 1(e). Each resonator behaves as an RLC circuit.\r
The inductance of each metallic resonator (L1,L2,L3, & L4) is calculated using Grover’s formula39\r

desired resonant frequency, and resistance to increase or decrease the reflection coefficient, we get similar\r
reflection spectra of MPA as obtained in CST microwave studio suite-based simulations. The reflection\r
characteristics (S11) obtained by ADS perfectly match with simulation results(figure 3(b)&(c)), which\r
confirms the accuracy of the results.\r

Results and discussion\r
Prospects of MPA increase with enhancement in the working frequency band and also with the increase in\r
number of absorption peaks. We properly optimize the lattice structure (by optimizing the shape and size\r
of the resonators) of the MPA to enhance working frequency band and also the number of absorption peaks.\r
We carry out simulations for absorption spectra of the proposed MPA for five different structures for :\r
(1) one stripe resonator - we get two resonance frequencies with a maximum of 32% absorption, (2) two\r
stripes resonators- two resonances are obtained but absorption increases up to 50%, (3) two metal stripes\r
and one square resonator (SR)- we get four absorption peaks, first with 100% absorption, second with 70%\r
absorption, third with 58% absorption, and fourth with 55% absorption, (4) two metal stripes and two SRs\u0002we get four absorption peaks, first & second with almost 100% absorption, third with 67% absorption, and\r
fourth with 42% absorption, and (5) two metal stripes and one open book like resonator between the stripes\r
–four resonance absorption peaks at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz\r
are acheived as shown in figure 4(a). The absorption coefficients obtained forthese resonance frequencies\r
are 99.12%,99.95%,98.5%, and 99%, respectively. The high absorption coefficients occur due to the\r
strong inductive–capacitive coupling between the resonators. The resonators of different sizes own the\r
ability to produce absorption peaks at specific frequencies and their superposition effect yields perfect\r
absorption in multiple frequency bands41–43. Thus, the dimension of the unit cell structure and the shape\r
of resonators have a vital role in accomplishing absorption near unity.\r

(b) Absorption spectra of the MPA with the different oblique incidence of THz beam..\r
We also figure out the effect of incidence angle on the absorption peaks. Absorption spectra with\r
different angles of incidence of THz wave is shown in Figure 3(b). As the incidence angle increases, the\r
first resonance absorption peak (1.79THz) is almost stable while higher-order absorption peaks display\r
deviations. It shows that higher-order absorption peaks are more sensitive to the incidence angle of THz\r
than the first absorption peak. Thus, the first resonance absorption frequency is a good choice for the\r
target sensing of microorganisms.\r
We investigate the performance of the sensor for different microorganisms such as yeast, pesticides,\r
and fungi. Experimental data reported by Park et.al14 and theoretical data (obtained using the effective\r

medium theory based on the Maxwell-Garnett mode) for dielectric constants of microorganisms are\r
used for our investigations. Experimentally, Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi) and yeast were grown by\r
streaking on medium method at 37◦C and deposited on the surface of metamaterial. A conventional photo\u0002lithography method was used to prepare the metamaterial pattern and THz time-domain spectroscopic\r
technique was used to characterize the samples14. The measured values of the dielectric constants were\r

reported between 1.37-1.94 for fungi and 5.38-8.54 for yeast. Experimental findings were examined using\r
the finite difference time-domain solver. The absorption patterns for Penicillium chrysogenum(fungai)\r
and yeast are shown in Figure 5(a). The respective frequency shifts of 70GHz and 103GHz are observed\r
for Penicillium chrysogenum and yeast. Due to large dielectric constant of yeast, redistribution of the\r
resonance of electric and magnetic fields leading to a strong modulation of the absorption peak provides\r
larger resonance shift. The traits of the sensed microorganism can be obtained by calculating the frequency\r
shift of the absorption peaks.\r
We also study the sensing performance for several pesticides like Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate\r
sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol. For\r
this purpose, we use the experimental values of refractive indices reported by Maeng et. al5. The measured\r
refractive index(RI) of Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide,\r
N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol are shown in Table 1. The absorption vs\r
frequency spectra of all pesticides is shown in Figure 5(b). A redshift of resonance frequencies by 70GHz\r
is observed in presence of pesticides.\r

To gain deep insight into the physical mechanism behind the absorption of MPA, we studied the surface\r
current distribution on the top and bottom metallic layers of the unit cell at resonance conditions. Figure.\r
6(a1-d1) & (a2-d2) show the surface current distribution of the top and the bottom layers, respectively.\r
Antiparallel currents form a current loop leading to the excitation of the magnetic dipole resonance44\r
.\r
The surface currents on both metallic layers are flowing in opposite directions at resonance (Fig. 6),\r
which generates the magnetic flux coupling with the incident H-field. The antiparallel direction of surface\r
currents on the top and bottom layers of MPA validates that the absorption peaks are caused by magnetic\r
resonance responses. Therefore, the stronger absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of\r
multiple high-order magnetic resonances.\r
Conclusion\r
We develop a novel THz MPA-based sensor for sensing of biological analytes. The highest absorp\u0002tion coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure. Four resonance absorption peaks\r
at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz having absorption coefficients\r
99.12%,99.95%,98.5%, and 99%, respectively are obtained.We also study the absorption spectra of the\r
MPA with different oblique incidences of THz wave and found that lower resonance absorption peak\r
(1.79T Hz) is almost stable while higher absorption peaks show deviations. The effect of structural\r
parameters(length and width of metal stripes and book resonator) on the resonance frequencies is analysed\r
to get the optimum performance of the MPA. To gain deep insight into the mechanism of MPA, an\r
equivalent circuit model is developed using Advance Design System (ADS) software. Surface current\r
distribution depicts that strong absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of multiple high - order\r
resonances.Due to the change in the effective dielectric constant of MPA environment with the deposition\r
of microorganisms, significant redshifts in the resonance peaks (redshift of 103GHz for yeast, redshift\r
of 70GHz for fungi) are observed. These shifts in resonance frequencies are due to the redistribution of\r
the resonance electric and magnetic fields, which lead to a strong modulation of the absorption. Thus, by\r
functionalizing the substrates with antibodies a selective detection of microorganisms is also plausible.\r
We believe that this MPA-based THz biosensor can open up new opportunities for obtaining dielectric\r
information of microorganisms, which has great potential in label-free biosensing for future biomedical\r
applications.\r

ABSTRACT\r
We report a multi-resonant THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor in the working frequency\r
range of 0.2 to 4THz for the sensing of microorganisms such as fungi, yeast, and pesticides. Nearly\r
100% absorption is realized at f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz. To obtain optimum\r
performance of the MPA, a mapping of amplitudes and shifts in the absorption resonance peaks with\r
different structural parameters of the resonators is carried out. Investigations of the effect of the\r
incidence angle of the THz wave on the absorption spectra of the MPA is also carried out. It is found\r
that incidence angle does not impact the stability of the lower resonance absorption peak (1.79T Hz). To\r
better understand the mechanism of MPA, an equivalent circuit model using Advance Design System\r
(ADS) software is developed. The calculated results through the model show similar trends as obtained in\r
the simulations using CST. A significant frequency shift in the resonances is obtained with the application\r
of microorganisms such as Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi), yeast, and pesticides (Imidacloprid, N,\r
N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt\r
hydrate, and Dicofol) as testing analytes. The THz MPA-based biosensor has great potential to detect a\r
very small change in the effective dielectric constant of the MPA environment therefore it can offer huge\r
opportunities in label-free biosensing for future biomedical applications.\r
Introduction\r
Sensors are vital part of modern technology due to their applications in imaging, medicine, food quality\r
control, agriculture, defence, etc. Food safety and security, two foremost public health concerns1–3,\r
require fast and non-destructive inspection techniques. Due to fingerprints of pesticide and antibiotics in\r
terahertz (THz) spectral range4, 5, THz spectroscopy facilitates non-contact, label-free, non-destructive\r
inspection for food safety and control6–11. Moreover, the detection of microorganisms such as bacteria,\r
viruses, and fungi is also very important for food security12. However, due to the typical size of λ/100,\r
microorganisms are transparent at THz frequency leading to low scattering cross-section and are difficult\r
to detect by the THz spectroscopy13. To overcome this constraint, metamaterial-based THz sensors have\r
been proposed for the detection of microorganisms like bacteria, yeast, and molds14, where metamaterial\r
resonators are designed in such a way that the gap area of resonators becomes compatible with the size of\r
microorganisms. Here, the resonance frequency of metamaterials is extremely sensitive to any changes\r
in the dielectric constant of the gap area of the resonator15, 16. Presently, extensive research is being\r
carried out to develop metamaterial-based resonant devices such as modulators, sensors, polarization\r
conversion devices, absorbers, etc.17–19. Among these devices, metamaterial perfect absorbers (MPAs)\r
have fascinated worldwide attention due to their excellent performance and their potential applications20, 21.

MPAs are able to minimize the reflectivity and transmissivity close to zero. To further expand the\r
application prospects of MPAs, the number of absorption frequency peaks and workable frequency bands\r
need to be broadened. Several reports show that flexibility to work in a wide range of frequency band\r
can be obtained by optimizing the dimensions of MPAs22–28. Zamzam et. al29 designed an MPA with\r
a metal-dielectric-metal multi-layer column with different heights of the dielectric layer, where they\r
achieved two absorption peaks. Wang et. al30 demonstrate a triple-band terahertz metamaterial absorber\r
at 0.337, 0.496, and 0.718THz where they used three concentric square ring resonators. A metamaterial\r
absorber consisting of three closed circular ring resonators on a polyethylene terephthalate substrate is\r
investigated by Abdulkarim et. al31. The absorption mechanism was comprehensively investigated through\r
parametric studies, where a Q-factor of 50.72 and a maximum sensitivity of 149.5 GHz/RIU were reported.\r
Meng et. al demonstrated a multi-band terahertz absorber made of periodic square metallic ribbon with a\r
T-shaped gap. Several resonator structures like square spiral shape32, SSRR( square split ring resonator)33,\r
Jerusalem Cross34 , CSRR (Circular split ring resonator)35, eight-resistive arm cell36, and Ring C-shape\r
quasi-MMA37 have been investigated. Most of the reported THz meta-sensors suffer from the limitations\r
such as larger unit cell size, one or two absorption peaks, low absorption coefficients, and polarization\r
sensitivity. In this paper, we report a THz metamaterial perfect absorber-based biosensor that shows almost\r
100% absorption in the THz frequency range for fast and non-destructive detection of microorganisms like\r
molds, yeast cells, fungi, and pesticides. We observe multi-resonant (four) peaks in the frequency range\r
of 0.1 - 3.8 THz. We carried out detailed simulations to study the sensing performance of the proposed\r
sensor. A significant frequency shift in the inductive-capacitive resonance is obtained with the application\r
of microorganisms. A mapping of shifts in the resonance peaks of MPA with structural parameters is\r
carried out. Multi-resonant MPA-based THz biosensors are remarkably desirable for label-free biosensing\r
of a family of microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, molds, etc.). The proposed sensor is extremely suitable for\r
the detection of pesticides because their specific absorption fingerprint lie in the frequency range of 0.1 to"""

Design and analysis of MPA based sensor\r
We investigate several metastructures consisting of 1) only one stripe resonator, 2) two stripes resonator,\r
3) two stripes and one square resonator (SR), 4) two stripes and two SRs, and 5) two stripes and 1 open\r
book-like resonator (designed from putting two SRs obliquely) on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) substrate\r
(dielectric constant 12.96) for MPA based sensor (Fig.1). GaAs substrate is selected due to its high band\r
gap, high breakdown voltage, and better heat & moisture resistivity. A thick gold layer on the lower side\r
of the substrate as a ground plane is used to suppress the transmission of the THz signal. We select gold\r
due to its high conductivity, which causes inductance and capacitance to produce resonance at the desired\r
frequency.\r
The highest absorption coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure, where oblique\r
sheets offer the ability to manipulate the bandwidth of MPA leading to different resonance conditions\r
and different optical paths for resonances38. Sensor parameters of an open book-type metastructure\r
are optimized as: periodicity (P) = 70µm, substrate thickness (ts) = 15µm, width of metal stripes\r
(ws) = 4.5µm, length of metal stripes (Ls) = 50µm, gap between the metal stripes (G) = 40µm, the\r
thickness of ground metallic plane (tm) = 0.08µm, length(L) and width(w) of the open book resonator\r
= 20µm and 15µm, g = 5µm respectively. A plane electromagnetic wave(THz) polarized along the x-axis\r
is used to illuminate the proposed device. We applied unit cell boundary conditions in the x- and y\u0002directions, while the THz beam is incident normally along the z-direction. The schematic of MPA - based\r
sensor with incident, reflected, and absorbed THz beam is shown in figure 1(f). Simulations are carried\r

To suppress the transmission of THz wave through MPA to zero, a metallic ground plane on the bottom\r

To better understand the absorption behavior, we thoroughly investigate the effect of structural\r
parameters on the resonance frequencies. 2D colormaps in Fig. 2 show the effect of variation of length\r
of the stripe (Ls), the width of the stripes (ws), width and position of the open book resonator on the\r
absorption coefficient. The value of Ls\r
is varied from 20µm to 50µm as shown in Figure 2(a). Due to\r
the increase in inductance and capacitance of metallic stripes with an increase in Ls\r
, a redshift in the\r
resonances are observed with the increase in Ls. The maximum absorption is obtained at Ls = 50µm.\r
The effect of the width of the metal stripe (ws) (from 4µm to 10µm) on the absorption coefficient is\r
shown in Figure 2(b). The absorption coefficients for all four resonances become unity at ws = 4.5µm,\r
which starts decreasing with an increase in ws\r
, which is due to enhancement in the size of metallic\r
resonators leading to high reflections. We also investigate the effect of the w parameter (width of open\r
book type SRs from w = 5−30µm) on the absorption performances of the MPA(Figure 2(c)). We obtain\r
the highest absorption for w = 15µm without any shift in the resonance frequencies. Figure 2(d) shows\r
the effect of the length of SRs (for L = 10 to 50µm) on resonance frequencies and absorption coefficients.\r
It is found that the absorption coefficient decreases with the increase in the length of the open book due to\r
high reflections. MPA gives the highest absorption for L = 20µm and zero absorption for L = 50µm.\r

Equivalent circuit model of MPA using Advance Design System (ADS)\r
To better understand the absorption mechanism of the proposed MPA, an equivalent lumped circuit has\r
been designed using ASD -2019 simulation software (Figure 3), where unit cell of MPA has four resonators\r
i.e. two metal stripes and two SRs as shown in Figure 1(e). Each resonator behaves as an RLC circuit.\r
The inductance of each metallic resonator (L1,L2,L3, & L4) is calculated using Grover’s formula39\r

desired resonant frequency, and resistance to increase or decrease the reflection coefficient, we get similar\r
reflection spectra of MPA as obtained in CST microwave studio suite-based simulations. The reflection\r
characteristics (S11) obtained by ADS perfectly match with simulation results(figure 3(b)&(c)), which\r
confirms the accuracy of the results.\r

Results and discussion\r
Prospects of MPA increase with enhancement in the working frequency band and also with the increase in\r
number of absorption peaks. We properly optimize the lattice structure (by optimizing the shape and size\r
of the resonators) of the MPA to enhance working frequency band and also the number of absorption peaks.\r
We carry out simulations for absorption spectra of the proposed MPA for five different structures for :\r
(1) one stripe resonator - we get two resonance frequencies with a maximum of 32% absorption, (2) two\r
stripes resonators- two resonances are obtained but absorption increases up to 50%, (3) two metal stripes\r
and one square resonator (SR)- we get four absorption peaks, first with 100% absorption, second with 70%\r
absorption, third with 58% absorption, and fourth with 55% absorption, (4) two metal stripes and two SRs\u0002we get four absorption peaks, first & second with almost 100% absorption, third with 67% absorption, and\r
fourth with 42% absorption, and (5) two metal stripes and one open book like resonator between the stripes\r
–four resonance absorption peaks at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz\r
are acheived as shown in figure 4(a). The absorption coefficients obtained forthese resonance frequencies\r
are 99.12%,99.95%,98.5%, and 99%, respectively. The high absorption coefficients occur due to the\r
strong inductive–capacitive coupling between the resonators. The resonators of different sizes own the\r
ability to produce absorption peaks at specific frequencies and their superposition effect yields perfect\r
absorption in multiple frequency bands41–43. Thus, the dimension of the unit cell structure and the shape\r
of resonators have a vital role in accomplishing absorption near unity.\r

Figure 4. (a)The simulated absorbance spectra of the designed MPA for five different types of resonators;\r
(b) Absorption spectra of the MPA with the different oblique incidence of THz beam..\r
We also figure out the effect of incidence angle on the absorption peaks. Absorption spectra with\r
different angles of incidence of THz wave is shown in Figure 3(b). As the incidence angle increases, the\r
first resonance absorption peak (1.79THz) is almost stable while higher-order absorption peaks display\r
deviations. It shows that higher-order absorption peaks are more sensitive to the incidence angle of THz\r
than the first absorption peak. Thus, the first resonance absorption frequency is a good choice for the\r
target sensing of microorganisms.\r
We investigate the performance of the sensor for different microorganisms such as yeast, pesticides,\r
and fungi. Experimental data reported by Park et.al14 and theoretical data (obtained using the effective\r

medium theory based on the Maxwell-Garnett mode) for dielectric constants of microorganisms are\r
used for our investigations. Experimentally, Penicillium chrysogenum (fungi) and yeast were grown by\r
streaking on medium method at 37◦C and deposited on the surface of metamaterial. A conventional photo\u0002lithography method was used to prepare the metamaterial pattern and THz time-domain spectroscopic\r
technique was used to characterize the samples14. The measured values of the dielectric constants were\r
7/12

reported between 1.37-1.94 for fungi and 5.38-8.54 for yeast. Experimental findings were examined using\r
the finite difference time-domain solver. The absorption patterns for Penicillium chrysogenum(fungai)\r
and yeast are shown in Figure 5(a). The respective frequency shifts of 70GHz and 103GHz are observed\r
for Penicillium chrysogenum and yeast. Due to large dielectric constant of yeast, redistribution of the\r
resonance of electric and magnetic fields leading to a strong modulation of the absorption peak provides\r
larger resonance shift. The traits of the sensed microorganism can be obtained by calculating the frequency\r
shift of the absorption peaks.\r
We also study the sensing performance for several pesticides like Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate\r
sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol. For\r
this purpose, we use the experimental values of refractive indices reported by Maeng et. al5. The measured\r
refractive index(RI) of Imidacloprid, N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt trihydrate, Daminozide,\r
N, N-Diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt hydrate, and Dicofol are shown in Table 1. The absorption vs\r
frequency spectra of all pesticides is shown in Figure 5(b). A redshift of resonance frequencies by 70GHz\r
is observed in presence of pesticides.\r

To gain deep insight into the physical mechanism behind the absorption of MPA, we studied the surface\r
current distribution on the top and bottom metallic layers of the unit cell at resonance conditions. Figure.\r
6(a1-d1) & (a2-d2) show the surface current distribution of the top and the bottom layers, respectively.\r
Antiparallel currents form a current loop leading to the excitation of the magnetic dipole resonance44\r
.\r
The surface currents on both metallic layers are flowing in opposite directions at resonance (Fig. 6),\r
which generates the magnetic flux coupling with the incident H-field. The antiparallel direction of surface\r
currents on the top and bottom layers of MPA validates that the absorption peaks are caused by magnetic\r
resonance responses. Therefore, the stronger absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of\r
multiple high-order magnetic resonances.\r
Conclusion\r
We develop a novel THz MPA-based sensor for sensing of biological analytes. The highest absorp\u0002tion coefficient is obtained for an open book-type metastructure. Four resonance absorption peaks\r
at frequencies f1 = 1.7T Hz, f2 = 2.8T Hz, f3 = 3.2T Hz, f4 = 3.5T Hz having absorption coefficients\r
99.12%,99.95%,98.5%, and 99%, respectively are obtained.We also study the absorption spectra of the\r
MPA with different oblique incidences of THz wave and found that lower resonance absorption peak\r
(1.79T Hz) is almost stable while higher absorption peaks show deviations. The effect of structural\r
parameters(length and width of metal stripes and book resonator) on the resonance frequencies is analysed\r
to get the optimum performance of the MPA. To gain deep insight into the mechanism of MPA, an\r
equivalent circuit model is developed using Advance Design System (ADS) software. Surface current\r
distribution depicts that strong absorption of the MPA is instigated by the excitation of multiple high - order\r
resonances.Due to the change in the effective dielectric constant of MPA environment with the deposition\r
of microorganisms, significant redshifts in the resonance peaks (redshift of 103GHz for yeast, redshift\r
of 70GHz for fungi) are observed. These shifts in resonance frequencies are due to the redistribution of\r
the resonance electric and magnetic fields, which lead to a strong modulation of the absorption. Thus, by\r
functionalizing the substrates with antibodies a selective detection of microorganisms is also plausible.\r
We believe that this MPA-based THz biosensor can open up new opportunities for obtaining dielectric\r
information of microorganisms, which has great potential in label-free biosensing for future biomedical\r
applications.\r

Methods\r
We have used commercial software CST Microwave studio suite to design and simulate our MM unit cell.\r
In the x – and y – directions, unit cell boundary conditions are applied and in z-direction, open add space\r
is employed to obtain the absorption behavior of the unit cell with adaptive tetrahedral messing. THz\r
radiation is incident normally on the structure with an electric field along the x- direction. A field monitor\r
is applied at the resonant frequency to obtain electric field and surface current distribution. Additionally,\r
advanced design system(ADS -2019) software is used to design equivalent circuit of MPA using to analysis\r
its functioning. In our simulation, we chose GaAs as a substrate with a dielectric constant of 12.94 and\r
loss tangent of 0.006, and gold as a metal for resonator16.\r
