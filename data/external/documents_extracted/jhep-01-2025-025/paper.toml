Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent\r
from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary\r
differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for\r
continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement\r
entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to\r
holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor\r
models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our\r
algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally,\r
we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data\r
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional\r
systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding\r
chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the\r
metallic property of these models.\r

1 Introduction\r
Entanglement, a fundamental characteristic of quantum mechanics, elucidates the intriguing\r
non-local correlations between quantum entities, and is at the core of quantum information\r
sciences [1–3]. Especially, the notion of entanglement entropy now exerts a wide-ranging\r
influence, spanning from condensed matter [4] to high-energy quantum field theory [5] and\r
even extending into quantum gravity [6].\r
Within condensed matter physics, for example, entanglement entropy proves its versatility\r
as a tool, facilitating the characterization of quantum phases and the intricate dynamics\r
of strongly correlated many-body systems [7, 8]. The scaling behavior of entanglement\r
entropy [9] offers insights into phases beyond symmetry characterization, particularly useful\r
for identifying exotic states like topological phases [10–12] and spin liquids [13, 14]. Ad\u0002ditionally, entanglement entropy aids in exploring quantum criticality [15], understanding\r
non-equilibrium dynamics [16, 17], and assessing numerical techniques for efficient many-body\r
physics simulation [18].\r
Holographic entanglement entropy. Nevertheless, the concept of entanglement entropy\r
has also garnered increased attention in recent decades due to its significant role in holography\r
(AdS/CFT correspondence) [19–21]. Holography entails a duality between boundary quantum\r
field theories and bulk gravitational theories, offering a compelling framework for understand\u0002ing the emergence of spacetime geometry from quantum entanglement. Particularly notable\r

is its connection exemplified in the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula [22], which establishes a\r
relationship between the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in the boundary field theory\r
and the area of the minimal surface in the bulk corresponding to the same region.1\r
By leveraging the RT formula and understanding gravity through the lens of quantum\r
entanglement, the holographic examination of entanglement entropy not only offers a more\r
manageable approach to studying and computing this measure, but also yields general\r
lessons applicable other branches of physics such, as quantum field theories and strongly\r
coupled many-body physics [31]. For instance, the c-theorem, established in two-dimensional\r
conformal field theory, is derived from analyzing how entanglement entropy evolves under\r
renormalization group flows [32]. Also, holographic entanglement entropy proves instrumental\r
in the study of the aforementioned condensed matter physics by characterizing various phases\r
of matter, exemplified by holographic superconductors [33].2 This elucidates phenomena such\r
as phase transitions, quantum criticality, and topological order, offering valuable insights into\r
the entanglement properties of strongly correlated quantum systems.\r
Bulk reconstruction in holography. It is worth noting that, in most studies of holographic\r
entanglement entropy, the standard approach is the bottom-up methodology. In this frame\u0002work, gravitational bulk theories are employed to depict the realistic dual boundary quantum\r
systems (e.g., characterized by broken translational symmetries), and the RT formula is used\r
to study the associated entanglement entropy.\r
Nonetheless, despite significant advancements over the past decade, which provide\r
compelling evidence that the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical\r
degrees of freedom plays a pivotal role in shaping the emergent holographic spacetime\r
geometry and its dynamics, an open question remains. Specifically, it is still unclear which\r
bulk gravity model can accurately reproduces the entanglement features of a given quantum\r
system on the boundary and how to identify such models.\r
One essential approach for identifying such bulk gravity theories is termed ‘bulk recon\u0002struction’, representing a non-trivial inverse problem entailing holographic mapping from\r
lower (boundary) to higher (bulk) dimensions. A captivating aspect within this endeavor is the\r
reconstruction of the metric in the holographic spacetime.3 There are numerous methodologies\r
for bulk metric reconstruction, leveraging diverse boundary physical quantities. These include\r
the source and expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor [39], singularities in sets of\r
correlation functions [40, 41], entanglement entropy of boundary intervals [42–45],4 differential\r
entropy, a UV-finite combination of entanglement entropy [47–49], divergence structure of\r
boundary n-point functions [50, 51], modular Hamiltonians of boundary subregions [52, 53],\r
Wilson loops related to quark potential [54], four-point correlators in an excited quantum\r
1The RT formula, along with its subsequent generalizations [23–26], provides a deeper elucidation of the\r
pivotal role of entanglement in holographic duality. Another noteworthy entanglement measure is the reflected\r
entropy, which possesses a gravity dual known as the entanglement wedge cross section [27–30].\r
2Please refer to [34] for a comprehensive list of additional references regarding the investigation of\r
entanglement in diverse holographic matters.\r
3Additional significant branches can be found in [35–38], with particular emphasis on bulk operator recon\u0002struction.\r

entropy in lattice Yang-Mills theory.\r

state [55], and holographic complexities [56, 57], among others. It is noteworthy that much\r
of the research on metric reconstruction has been motivated by the notion that spacetime\r
is constructed from quantum entanglement [22, 58–62].5\r
Machine learning and holography. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as\r
a promising approach to addressing bulk reconstruction by identifying the underlying bulk\r
theory, such as reconstructing the bulk metric. Efficient holographic modeling has been\r
successfully demonstrated through the application of machine learning techniques with various\r
physical quantities, including lattice QCD data of the chiral condensate, hadron spectra,\r
meson spectrum, shear viscosity, optical conductivity, and entanglement entropy, and so\r
forth [66–86].6\r
Machine learning holography not only facilitates the construction of data-driven holo\u0002graphic models but also provides insights into deeper understanding of holography itself.\r
This approach is referred to as the AdS/DL correspondence, and establishes connections\r
between deep learning (DL) — a form of machine learning utilizing deep neural networks —\r
and holography. Here, deep learning functions as a solver for the inverse problem, enabling\r
the determination of the bulk metric upon traning the neural network. Readers interested in\r
grasping the essential concept of AdS/DL within a simplified framework are encouraged to\r
refer [91], which illustrates this concept through a classical mechanics problem.\r
Motivation of this paper. In this manuscript, we investigate the reconstruction of the\r
holographic bulk metric through machine learning of the boundary entanglement entropy.\r
Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning in this context.\r
Note that a machine learning method has been applied in related contexts [77, 78], where\r
authors inferred the dual geometry from a given entanglement entropy using the RT formula\r
and deep learning methods. However, due to inherent discontinuities in their algorithm, the\r
reconstructed metric lacks continuity. Additionally, for simplicity, the entanglement entropy\r
was assumed to have the dual geometry when only the blackening factor f(z) is unknown,\r
for instance, h(z) = 1 in (2.1). We intend to enhance this work by incorporating a neural\r
ODE approach and a more generic metric setup, i.e., any function of f(z) and h(z),\r
7 making\r
it more compatible with bulk reconstruction programs for continuous and generic metrics.\r
It is also worth mentioning that when h(z) = 1, one may not need to resort to machine\r
learning holography; instead, Bilson’s method [44] can be utilized to invert the RT formula,\r
generating the metric as output and entanglement entropy as input. Nevertheless, for\r
completeness, we review Bilson’s method in the main text and discuss its limitations when\r
h(z) ̸= 1, motivating the use of machine learning holography to find the complete metric\r
from entanglement entropy.\r
5Another notable progression in investigating bulk reconstruction in holography involves a novel approach\r
from quantum many-body systems, termed the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) of\r
tensor networks [60, 63–65].\r
6Other related works that extract the spacetime metric using machine learning, independent of holography,\r
can be found in [87–90].\r

In the scenario of isotropic geometries, (2.1) represents the most general metric setup. Specifically, metrics\r
where (gtt ̸= gzz ̸= gxx) can always be expressed in the form of (2.1) through coordinate transformations. For\r
detailed discussions, refer to [92].\r

As illustrative examples for our purpose, in this study, we initially employ two represen\u0002tative holographic entanglement entropy models with h(z) ̸= 1: the Gubser-Rocha model [93]\r
and the holographic superconductor model [94, 95], where the former has been particularly\r
instrumental in examining the characteristics of strange metals.8 Moreover, in addition to\r
the aforementioned holographic matter models, we incorporate entanglement entropy data\r
from quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we utilize data obtained from a fermionic\r
tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional systems [99] to ascertain the\r
corresponding emergent bulk metric.\r
In essence, we propose applying data-driven and machine learning methodologies to unveil\r
the emergent continuous metric based on boundary entanglement entropy data. Analyzing\r
various entanglement entropy dataset within the generic and continuous metric configuration,\r
our objective is to establish machine learning holography as both a practical and theoretical\r
framework. Through our investigation, we aim to offer valuable insights into the fundamental\r
aspects of quantum entanglement, thereby deepening our understanding of many-body\r
quantum physics and potentially advancing the exploration of holographic duality.\r
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a quick review of the RT formula\r
concerning the holographic entanglement entropy. Additionally, in section 3, we discuss\r
Bilson’s method for generating the metric from entanglement entropy and address its limitation\r
in studying the complete metric. Section 4 introduces a machine learning method tailored\r
to determine the continuous/generic metric based on provided entanglement entropy. As\r
input data of machine learning method, we utilize both the holographic entanglement entropy\r
and entanglement entropy from a fermionic tight-binding chain. Finally, section 5 is devoted\r
to conclusions.\r

It is noteworthy that the Gubser-Rocha model [93] can be derived through a top-down approach. Specifically,\r
for d = 3, it results from a consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on AdS4 ×\r
S\r

[93], while for d = 4, it is derived from ten-dimensional type IIB String Theory as the near-horizon\r
limit of D3-branes [93, 96]. See also [97, 98] for discussions on top-down holographic superconductors from\r
string/M-theory. Consequently, our study can also be regarded as an exploration of such top-down models\r
through the lens of machine learning.\r

3 Bilson’s method\r
It is instructive to note that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.4) establishes a relationship\r
where the entanglement entropy is derived from a given metric. In other words, the metric\r
serves as the input data, while the entanglement entropy emerges as the output.\r
3.1 Preliminary for the Bilson’s method\r
On the other hands, Bilson’s method [44] attempts to invert the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.4),\r
flipping the roles of metric and entanglement entropy. Here, the metric becomes the output,\r
while the entanglement entropy becomes the input.\r
Bilson’s method involves two main ingredients. Firstly, it employs the handbook of\r
integral equations [100] to express:\r
F(z∗) = Z z∗\r
ϵ\r
1\r
p\r
G(z∗) − G(z)\r
Y (z) dz , G′(z∗) > 0\r

(3.1)\r
The integral equation presented here shows how one function, F(z∗), can be expressed in\r
terms of another, Y (z∗), with the roles reversed in the “Solution” part of the equation.\r
Another key aspect of Bilson’s method involves the connection between the entanglement\r
entropy to the metric via the following derivative relationship\r

where we used the chain rule for derivatives, including how changes in the entanglement entropy\r
S with respect to the subsystem size ℓ are mediated through an intermediate variable z∗.\r
To understand (3.2), note that the chain rule splits the derivative into two parts: the\r
changes of S with respect to z∗, and the change of z∗ with respect to ℓ. These components\r
are further detailed as:\r

where the first term involving the limit as z approaches z∗ captures the local behavior near\r
z∗, while the integral term encodes contributions from the entire interval [0, z∗].\r
3.2 Reconstruction formula\r
To leverage Bilson’s method effectively, it is beneficial to choose the following coordinate\r
h(z) = 1 . (3.5)\r
This choice simplifies the mathematics significantly. We will address the general case where\r
h(z) ̸= 1 towards the conclusion of this subsection.\r
Reconstruction formula I. Subsequently, we can recast the entanglement entropy (2.4)\r
into the form\r

Comparing the expression (3.6) with the general formula (3.1), we identify the functions\r
F(z∗), Y (z), and G(z) as\r
F(z∗) := 2GN\r

Using these identification, the “Solution” in (3.1) provides the reconstruction formula for\r

The resulting expression (3.8) represents the reconstruction formula provided by Bil\u0002son [44], where S(z∗) is derived from the data S(ℓ), with ℓ interchangeable with z∗ through (3.9).\r
Essentially, given the entanglement entropy S(ℓ), the metric component f(z) can be gen\u0002erated as the output.\r
Reconstruction formula II. Although (3.8) presents a novel approach, the entangle\u0002ment entropy data S(ℓ) predominantly hinges on the UV cutoff ϵ. Hence, from a practical\r
standpoint, it proves beneficial [57] to employ an alternative reconstruction formula de\u0002rived from the subsystem size in (2.4). Analogous to the entanglement entropy scenario,\r
employing (3.1) yields:\r

where ℓ(z∗) serves as the input and f(z) emerges as the output.\r
However, it is noteworthy that the input data ℓ(z∗) essentially derives from (3.9), where\r
the entanglement entropy S(ℓ) is provided. Thus, this second reconstruction formula (3.10)\r
also represents a scenario where the input data is the entanglement entropy.\r

Then, by plugging this expression into the reconstruction formula (3.10), we can deduce\r

which is consistent with the expected pure AdS metric, as given in (3.11).\r
Limitation of Bilson’s method. While Bilson’s method offers a structured approach\r
to reconstructing the metric, it is not without its limitations. It is straightforward to find\r
that for the generic metric where\r
h(z) ̸= 1 , (3.15)\r

Then, one can notice that the reconstruction program cannot proceed due to the inconsistency\r
between the number of input data and output data. In other words, given a single data\r
S(ℓ), one needs to determine two functions f(z) and h(z). Therefore, unless h(z) is provided,\r
Bilson’s method cannot fully reconstruct the metric.\r
Nevertheless, this limitation is not surprising, as previously noted [44]. An alternative\r

Even though we can reconstruct g(r) from the given S(ℓ) using (3.18), the inability to\r
determine χ(r) means that the full metric cannot be completely specified.9\r
In light of these challenges, the next section explores how machine learning techniques\r
can be used to overcome the limitations of Bilson’s method, enabling the reconstruction\r
of both f(z) and h(z) from the given S(ℓ).\r
3.3 Example: linear-axion model\r
Despite the limitations that Bilson’s method may entail, it remains a novel approach for\r
constructing the blackening factor f(z). We conclude this section by considering an example\r
where bulk reconstruction via Bilson’s method is viable: when h(z) = 1.\r
In this context, we investigate the bulk reconstruction process when the entanglement\r
entropy is provided numerically. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the\r
inaugural exploration of the numerical evaluation of the reconstruction formula (3.10).\r

Considering the parameters provided in (3.21), we illustrate SFinite in figure 2.\r

to the pure AdS example in (3.11), the next step for Bilson’s method entails inserting the\r
numerically obtained S into the reconstruction formula (3.9) to determine ℓ(z∗). However, in\r
this instance, we numerically evaluate ℓ(z∗) (as illustrated in the left panel of figure 3) and\r
subsequently determine the bulk metric component f(z) numerically via the reconstruction\r
formula (3.10).\r
The resulting f(z) from Bilson’s method is depicted by the solid line in the right panel of\r
figure 3. We confirm that this f(z) successfully reconstructs the target metric f(r) specified\r
in (3.20). Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the metric of the linear-axion model can\r
be constructed not only via the machine learning method utilizing optical conductivity [80],\r
but also through Bilson’s method (3.10) with entanglement entropy.\r

In this section, we investigate bulk reconstruction employing the machine learning approach,\r
which plays a pivotal role in revealing the complete metric described in (2.1). Our analysis\r
demonstrates that by implementing machine learning techniques, we can overcome the\r
constraints inherent in Bilson’s method: specifically, we achieve the reconstruction of both\r
f(z) and h(z) from the provided S(ℓ).\r

4.1 Methodology: neural ODEs and Monte-Carlo integration\r
As discussed in the introduction, the machine learning holography framework, also known as\r
the AdS/DL correspondence, has been employed in elucidating the holographic bulk theory\r
that underpins quantum systems on the boundary.\r
In the pioneering studies of the AdS/DL correspondence [66, 67], significant advancements\r
have primarily been achieved by discretizing the holographic bulk metric using deep learning\r
techniques. For example, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) can be solved within\r
the framework of a residual neural network (ResNet) [166], which is composed of residual\r
blocks [167].\r
In recent years, to achieve a continuous holographic bulk spacetime, a continuous version\r
of ResNet, known as the neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) [168], has been\r
developed. By employing neural ODEs in machine learning holography, the continuous bulk\r
metric has been reconstructed using boundary data, as demonstrated in the contexts of\r
quantum chromodynamics [72] and strongly interacting condensed matter systems [80, 81].\r
Neural ODEs. In this paper, we utilize the neural ODE framework within the context\r
of the holographic study of quantum information, with a particular focus on entanglement\r
entropy. Our machine learning methodology represents an integrated version of the neural\r
ODE, which we refer to as neural integration.\r
First, let us briefly review the concept of the ResNet using a simple ODE example:\r
∂zF = G(z, F; θ(z)), (4.1)\r
where F is the unknown function of z, G is a given function. Here, θ(z) represents a general\r
hidden function within the ODE, which serves as the trainable parameters in the neural\r
network. This equation can be solved using ODE solvers by discretizing the z interval into\r
small steps ∆z. For example, if we choose the Euler method as the solver, the approximate\r
numerical solution FN is given by\r
FN = F1 +\r
N\r
X−1\r
n=1\r
G(zn, Fn; θn) · ∆z , (4.2)\r
where the z interval is discretized into N steps, and F1 is the given initial value at z1 (for\r
more details, see [80]). Due to this discretization, the training parameters are also discretized;\r
for instance, θn(zn) could be the discretized metric fn(zn). This is the fundamental concept\r
of ResNet for generating the discretized bulk metric [66, 67].\r
The approximate numerical solution F can be more generally expressed as:\r
Ffinal = ODE Solver[G; Finitial, (zfinal, zinitial); θ(z)] . (4.3)\r
For instance, for the Euler method described in (4.2), we have\r
(Finitial, Ffinal) = (F1, FN ) and (zinitial, zfinal) = (1, N − 1), (4.4)\r
with the training parameter θ chosen as θn for the ResNet.\r

Figure 4. A structure of a deep neural network. It consists of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each.\r
The nodes are fully connected each other. Through the learning procedure, the continuous function\r
D(z) is generated where the input is z =: z\r
1\r
0\r
.\r
To ensure that the discrete hidden function becomes a continuous function, the central\r
idea of neural ODEs [168] is to replace the discrete parameter θ(z) = θn(zn) with a continuous\r
deep neural network θ(z) = D(z). This deep neural network consists of multiple layers through\r
which data is processed, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer.\r
The deep neural network is defined as follows\r
D(z) = WM · ϕ(· · · ϕ(W2 · ϕ(W1z + b1) + b2)· · ·) + bM , (4.5)\r
where ϕ is an activation function, WM is the weight matrix of M-th layer, and bM is the bias\r
vector of M-th layer. The activation function is a non-linear function applied to the output of\r
each layer, enabling the network to model complex patterns. In this paper, we use the rectified\r
linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function: ReLU(z) = max(0, z). The other parameters\r
(weights and biases) are adjusted during training to minimize errors in the loss function.\r
Continuous training variables in deep neural networks, primarily weights and biases,\r
are essential for the learning process. Weights determine the “strength” of connections\r
between nodes, while biases provide each layer with a trainable constant value to help the\r
model fit the data better. For an illustrative sketch of a deep neural network, see figure 4,\r
which shows the case of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each. By employing iterative forward\r
and backward propagation steps, along with optimization algorithms, these variables are\r
continuously refined to minimize errors and enhance the model’s efficacy.\r
In our deep neural network computations, we utilize the PyTorch framework [169], an\r
open-source machine learning library, and deep neural networks are initialized with 3 hidden\r
layers, each containing 20 nodes.\r
Neural integrations. In this manuscript, drawing inspiration from solving ODEs using deep\r
neural networks, we introduce a method for solving integrations through machine learning\r
techniques. Termed “neural integration,” this approach aligns well with our objective:\r
employing machine learning holography to analyze entanglement entropy (2.5).\r
To demonstrate further, let us consider the following integration, which can be obtained\r
by equation (4.1):\r
F =\r
Z zfinal\r

G(z; D(z))dz , (4.6)\r
– 13 –

JHEP01(2025)025\r
where we substitute θ(z) with the deep neural network D(z). Subsequently, our primary\r
objectives, the subsystem size ℓ (2.4), and the (finite piece) entanglement entropy SFinite (2.5),\r
can be expressed in the form of (4.6) as\r
SFinite =\r
Z z∗\r

1\r
z∗\r
, ℓ =\r

Gℓ(z; f(z), h(z)) dz , (4.7)\r
where SFinite (and ℓ) is compared with F, and the metric components with the deep neural\r
network D(z) in (4.5), i.e.,\r
f(z) ←→ Df (z), h(z) ←→ Dh(z). (4.8)\r
The optimization of deep neural networks conducts through the learning process to\r
achieve convergence between the estimated and intended values (given the input dataset\r
SFinite and ℓ). The estimated value is obtained via numerical integration in (4.7). In this\r
study, Monte Carlo integration serves as the numerical integrator, with Torchquad [170], an\r
extension package of PyTorch, utilized for Monte Carlo integration.12\r
More on the setup for machine learning holography. We further elaborate on the\r
setup for our machine learning methodology. Instead of utilizing (4.8), we adopt the following\r
technically convenient metric ansatz:\r
f(z) = (1 − z)\r
h\r
1 + (a + 1)z − z\r
2 Df (z)\r
i\r
, h(z) = 1 + az − z\r
2 Dh(z). (4.9)\r
This choice is motivated by several reasons. Firstly, we impose the horizon condition at\r
the horizon (z = 1) as f(1) = 0, and the asymptotic AdS boundary condition at the\r
boundary (z = 0) as f(0) = h(0) = 1. Furthermore, from the near-boundary expansion of\r
GS(z; f(z), h(z)) in (4.7) together with (2.5), it follows that\r
GS(z; f(z), h(z)) ≈\r
h\r
′\r
(0) − f\r
′\r
(0)\r
z\r
, (4.10)\r
which would result in a logarithmic UV divergence in SFinite, which is assumed to be absent in\r
our study.13 Within our ansatz (4.9), we eliminate this UV divergence since h\r
′\r
(0) = f\r
′\r
(0) = a.\r
Essentially, within our ansatz (4.9), we have three training parameters in our machine learning\r
method: the linear coefficient a, and the weights and biases of Df (z) and Dh(z).\r
Then, substituting (4.9) into (4.7) and initializing random values for a, weights, and\r
biases, SFinite(ℓ) can be computed. As an intermediate numerical step, both SFinite(z∗) and\r
ℓ(z∗) are evaluated within the selected range z∗ ∈ [0.1, 0.99].\r
Last but not least, we discuss the loss function L employed in our computation, which\r
is defined as\r

12It is noteworthy that while bulk holographic geometry is derived from given entanglement entropy using\r
deep learning methods [77, 78], the authors in [77] adopt ResNet together with the Runge-Kutta method\r
within the ODE framework (4.1), ensuring that the emergent metric remains a discrete function. Using the\r
different machine learning method based on the transformer algorithm, the discrete metric is also generated\r
in [78].\r
13Within the models of interest, we have checked that such an additional UV divergence term is absent.\r

where Nℓ denotes the number of the data points for ℓ. The first term quantifies the disparity\r
between the output entanglement entropy data S\r
(m)\r
Finite(ℓ) computed by the machine learning\r
and the provided input data SFinite(ℓ). The second term, referred to as the penalty term,\r
corresponds to the thermal entropy (s) (2.2), where the superscript index (m) indicates that\r
the thermal entropy is obtained through machine learning. This term is important for shaping\r
the loss function and influencing the optimization process.\r
In principle, alternative penalty terms could be chosen. However, opting for the thermal\r
entropy as the penalty term offers several intriguing aspects. Firstly, it aligns structurally\r
with the first term in the loss function. In other words, s\r
(m)\r
is obtained through machine\r
learning, while s is given from the input data. It is worth recalling that thermal entropy can\r
be inferred from the large subsystem size limit as SFinite ≈ s ℓ [22, 62]. Furthermore, through\r
the utilization of thermal entropy, an additional horizon condition on h(1) can be introduced\r
via (2.2), complementing the demonstration provided below (4.9). Thus, in aggregate, we have\r
imposed two AdS boundary conditions and two horizon condition on the metric components.\r
4.2 Emergent spacetime from holographic entanglement entropy\r
Utilizing the aforementioned machine learning methodologies, we commence with the training\r
procedure. Initially, within this section, we illustrate the emergence of full spacetime from\r
holographic entanglement entropy. To achieve this, we employ two exemplary and extensively\r
researched toy models of holographic matters, namely the Gubser-Rocha model [93] and\r
holographic superconductor model [94, 95], where the former has been instrumental in\r
examining the properties of strange metals. Our analysis here aims to demonstrate the\r
machine learning’s capability in accurately discerning the metric (2.1) based on holographic\r
entanglement entropy.\r
4.2.1 Linear-axion model\r
As a warm-up, we verify the efficacy of our machine learning approach in scenarios where\r
h(z) = 1, consistent with the results obtained through Bilson’s method outlined in section 3.3:\r
the linear-axion model (3.19).\r
Within the same dataset (3.21), we input data derived from the holographic entan\u0002glement entropy of the linear-axion model into the machine learning framework. Recall\r
the entanglement entropy depicted in figure 2, with fitting data represented by (3.22) and\r
corresponding coefficients listed in table 1.\r
In figure 5, we illustrate that our machine learning methodology successfully elucidates\r
the black hole geometry f(z) within the holographic bulk spacetime. The emergent metric,\r
as identified by the machine learning process, aligns closely with the geometry of the linear\u0002axion model described by (3.20). In appendix B, we discuss the detailed discussion of\r
the training procedure employed in our machine learning method, together with the error\r
estimation analysis.\r
4.2.2 Gubser-Rocha model\r
Subsequently, we apply the machine learning methodology to the Gubser-Rocha model [93]\r

where 16πGN = L = 1. Here, ϕ represents the dilaton field, the field strength is F = dA,\r
and the axion field ψI is also included. Notably, the Gubser-Rocha model (4.12) stands out\r
as one of the most prominent and celebrated holographic models, pivotal in elucidating the\r
properties of strange metals. Remarkably, the Gubser-Rocha model facilitates the study\r
of linear-in-T resistivity, attributed to the nature of the infrared fixed point [110, 111, 113,\r
117, 119, 120, 130, 139, 171–173].14\r
The Gubser-Rocha model (4.12) possesses another attractive feature in that it allows for\r
the analytic background solutions. Within our metric (2.1), it is described as\r

the phase diagram utilizing fermionic spectral functions [130] or conductivity [141] have been undertaken.\r
Additionally, discussions on certain limitations in describing transport anomalies, such as the Hall angle, have\r
also been addressed [120, 172].\r

Table 2. Numerical fitting coefficients for (3.22) of Gubser-Rocha model.\r
To initiate our machine learning methodology, we initially compute the holographic\r
entanglement entropy. Since the Gubser-Rocha model entails two free parameters: (µ, β),\r
akin to the linear-axion model (3.19), we opt for the same dataset (3.21).\r
Subsequently, by substituting (4.13) into (2.5), one can compute the entanglement entropy\r
numerically. Employing the parameters specified in (3.21), we depict SFinite in figure 6, where\r
we find its compatibility with (3.22) when fitted, with coefficients detailed in table 2.\r
It is worth noting that the value of c0 for the Gubser-Rocha model is finite, unlike\r
that for the linear-axion model as shown in table 1. To elucidate this distinction, we\r
analytically investigate c0 for our metric (2.1) in the limit of a small subsystems, as detailed\r
in appendix A. Specifically, we examine c0 as follows\r
c0 =\r
h\r
′\r
(0)\r
2\r
. (4.16)\r
We observe that when h(z) = 1, c0 equals 0, consistent with the numerical findings in the\r
linear-axion model. Conversely, when h(z) ̸= 1, c0 can be non-zero. This is evident in the\r
case of the Gubser-Rocha model (4.13): we checked that our numerical results in table 2\r
align with the analytical formula (4.16).\r
Finally, we plug data obtained from the holographic entanglement entropy of the Gubser\u0002Rocha model into the machine learning framework, utilizing the fitting data described\r
by (3.22) and the corresponding coefficients outlined in table 2. Subsequently, in figure 7,\r
we demonstrate that our machine learning methodology can reveal the complete black hole\r
geometry f(z) and h(z) within the holographic bulk spacetime. This validation underscores the\r

4.2.3 Holographic superconductors\r
We proceed to discuss another prominent example of spacetime within holography, character\u0002ized by h(z) ̸= 1, known as the holographic superconductor model [94, 95], often referred to as\r
the HHH model after its proponents, Hartnoll, Herzog, and Horowitz. This model stands as\r
one of the most widely studied frameworks in applied holography to condensed matter systems,\r
garnering significant attention in the field (for comprehensive reviews, refer to [174, 175]).\r
Precisely speaking, the U(1) symmetry in the dual field theory of the HHH model is global\r
rather than local, characterizing it as a superfluid rather than a superconductor. While some\r
aspects, such as electric conductivity, may not distinguish between the two, other features, such\r
as the dynamics of vortices and collective low-energy modes, markedly differentiate between a\r
superfluid and a superconductor. For instance, collective excitations in holographic superfluids\r
are second sound waves (superfluid Goldstone mode) [176, 177] which are absence in the\r
superconductors. Explorations of collective excitations in holographic superconductors are\r
conducted in [178], incorporating dynamical boundary gauge fields and explicitly confirming\r
the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Nevertheless, for the sake of consistency in our discussion,\r
we continue to refer to the HHH model as representing holographic superconductors.\r
The HHH model [94, 95] is given as\r

where it composes of field strength F = dA and a complex scalar field Φ with the covariant\r

we set m2 = −2 and q = 3 as chosen in the original paper [94, 95].\r
To investigate the metric of holographic superconductors, we numerically solve the\r
equations of motion derived from the action (4.17). For numerical convenience, we adopt\r

the following ansatz for the metric\r
f(z) = (1 − z)U(z), h(z) = V (z), (4.18)\r
where we impose the boundary condition U(0) = V (0) = 1 to ensure the asymptotic AdS\r
geometry. Additionally, for the matter fields, we choose\r
A = (1 − z)a(z) dt , Φ = z η(z), (4.19)\r
Notably, the boundary behavior of these matter fields is characterized by\r
At = µ − ρz + · · · , Φ = Φ(−)z + Φ(+) z\r
2 + · · · . (4.20)\r
According to the holographic dictionary, µ represents the chemical potential, ρ stands for\r
the charge density, and in the asymptotic form of Φ, Φ\r
(−) denotes the source while Φ(+)\r
represents the condensate. In our chosen ansatz (4.19), we straightforwardly derive the\r
chemical potential µ as µ = a(0) and the source Φ\r
(−) as Φ(−) = η(0).\r
Next, as the boundary condition for the superconducting phase, we set the source to be\r
zero, Φ\r
(−) = 0, to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking, expressed as\r
Φ\r
− = 0 , and ⟨O2⟩ := √\r
2 Φ+ , (4.21)\r
where the factor of √2 in defining the condensate ⟨O2⟩ follows from [94], serving as a\r
convenient normalization. Therefore, essentially, using the numerically obtained solutions,\r
one can discern between the superconducting phase, characterized by Φ\r
(+) ̸= 0, and a normal\r
phase, where Φ = 0, by computing the temperatures using (2.2). We present the plot of the\r
condensate in figure 8, depicting condensation when m2 = −2 and q = 3, with a critical\r
temperature of Tc/µ = 0.156, consistent with findings in [95].\r
Similarly to the Gubser-Rocha model, we begin our machine learning methodology by\r
computing the holographic entanglement entropy. For the superconductor examples, we\r
select three representative datasets characterized by\r

illustrated as colored dots in figure 8. Subsequently, by substituting the obtained numerical\r

We find its agreement with (3.22) when fitted, with coefficients provided in table 3. Here,\r
we also confirmed that the analytical formula (4.16) yields consistent numerical values for\r
c0 in the superconductor model.\r
Finally, we incorporate data derived from the holographic entanglement entropy of the\r
superconductor model into the machine learning framework. This involves utilizing the\r
fitting data described by (3.22) along with the corresponding coefficients outlined in table 3.\r
Subsequently, in figure 10, we showcase how our machine learning methodology proficiently\r
reveals the complete black hole geometry f(z) and h(z) for the holographic superconductor.\r
This validation again underscores the effectiveness of our machine learning approach in\r
accurately capturing the entire geometry, even in scenarios where h(z) ̸= 1. The error\r
estimation analysis for the holographic superconductor model is given in appendix B.\r
It is worth noting that the functional form of h(z) for superconductors differs from that\r
of the Gubser-Rocha model (cfr. figure 10 vs. figure 7): h(z) monotonically decreases towards\r
the horizon for superconductor models, unlike the Gubser-Rocha model. Nonetheless, we\r
find that our machine learning approach can adeptly reconstruct all types of h(z).\r

we leverage data on the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional systems [99], specifically\r
focusing on data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling.\r
It is worth noting that [99] have also investigated the entanglement entropy in higher\u0002dimensional systems, which could be relevant to our AdS4 setup (2.1). Nonetheless, unlike\r
our holographic setup, the analysis in [99] does not consider strip-shaped entangling regions.\r
Hence, in this section, we concentrate on the one-dimensional (1 + 1D) case.\r

Setup for machine learning method. Building upon the holographic setup (4.25)–(4.26),\r

where it is referred to as the universal scaling function.15 One comment is in order. By\r
rescaling βv to β, one may eliminate the depencence on group velocity in the formula.\r
However, we do not adopt this approach, as it has been reported that the group velocity\r
may vary between different systems. Specifically, the group velocity can be calculated based\r
on the lowest energy within the symmetry sector associated with the crystal momentum.\r
For further discussion, refer to [99, 180].\r
4.3.2 Emergent metric from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling\r
As a supplementary note, it is worth mentioning the following. Let us consider the entan\u0002glement entropy S pertaining to the bipartition of a one-dimensional quantum many-body\r
system into a subsystem of length ℓ. When the system parameters and energy (temperature)\r
fall within a quantum critical regime of the model under consideration, established principles\r
dictate that the entanglement entropy may adhere to a universal scaling function [181–183].\r
Notably, in [99], it has been demonstrated that for the typical quantum many-body\r
systems complying with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, the entanglement entropy\r
of eigenstates can be characterized by a universal scaling function. Particularly, in critical\r
one-dimensional systems with linear dispersion at low energies, a universal scaling function\r
follows from CFT.16\r
In this paper, within machine learning framework, we focus on analyzing data obtained\r
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling [99], where it has been demonstrated\r
to adhere to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and is describable by a CFT with\r
c = 1. Notably, the entanglement entropy data SDATA from this chain is found to be with\r
parameters (c, v) = (1, 2) in (4.33): see figure 11.\r
Furthermore, in our machine learning method, for the sake of comparison, we also\r
investigate the BTZ case (4.29). In essense, we have two datasets available:\r
(c, v, β) =\r
\r
\r
\r
(24π, 1, 2π), (BTZ case)\r
(1, 2, 1), (Fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling)\r
(4.34)\r
where c = 3L/(2GN ) with L = 16πGN = 1 is employed for the BTZ case.17 Note that the\r
data from [99], figure 11, is scaled with the inverse temperature β. This can be accommodated\r
within the machine learning process by setting a fixed β,\r
β =\r
1\r
T\r
= −\r
4π\r
f\r
′(1) := 1 , (4.35)\r
where (4.24) is utilized.\r
15In principle, SDATA may contain a non-universal constant, which does not affect the scaling behavior\r
of ℓ and, therefore, is also not explicitly specified in [99]. Similarly, we omit such a term in our analysis.\r
Notably, in the study of entanglement entropy, examining the derivative of S with respect to the spatial size\r
of the entalgment region ℓ can prove advantageous. This approach, as suggested by [179], offers data that are\r
unaffected by the UV cutoff, thereby also avoiding the appearance of a non-universal constant.\r
16The presence of gapless excitations can be indicative of a critical point. At this point, the system does\r
not have a well-defined energy scale (gap) and exhibits critical fluctuations over all length scales. In a\r
one-dimensional fermionic chain, the critical point manifests as a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi\r
points k = ±π/2 as E(k) ≈ vF (k ∓ π/2), leading to low-energy excitations where vF is the Fermi velocity.\r
17Combining (4.32) with (4.33), one can notice that c does not play any role in SFinite. Nevertheless, we set\r
L = 16πGN = 1 and β = 2π in order for the metric of the BTZ black hole (4.27). It is noteworthy that the\r
central charge c can appear in our machine learning method through the thermal entropy (4.36).\r

Figure 11. SDATA for fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling [99], where (4.33) is used\r
with (c, v) = (1, 2).\r
Last but not least, it is worth noting that in our machine learning method aimed at\r
determining the complete metric, we utilize information of the thermal entropy s in (4.24).\r
When dealing with data, obtaining such thermal entropy is straightforward, as it can be\r
derived from the slope of the entanglement entropy in the large subsystem size limit [99]\r
(ℓ ≫ 1) : S ≈ SDATA ≈ s ℓ , −→ s =\r
cπ\r
3βv , (4.36)\r
where we employ (4.33), which aligns with holography [22, 62].18 Intuitively, when ℓ ≫ 1\r
the subsystem effectively encompasses the entire system, implying that the minimal surface\r
lies along the black hole horizon [45, 184], suggesting a potential connection between the\r
Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.3) and the thermal entropy density s.\r
Finally, we utilize data obtained from the entanglement entropy of a fermionic tight\u0002binding chain at half filling, as depicted in figure 11, into our machine learning framework.\r
Subsequently, as illustrated in figure 12, we demonstrate how our machine learning method\u0002ology adeptly uncovers the complete black hole geometry f(z) and h(z), even leveraging\r
entanglement entropy data from quantum many-body systems.\r
Two noteworthy findings are made from our analysis. Firstly, as demonstrated in figure 12,\r
our machine learning method accurately captures the dual geometry of the CFT, specifically\r
in the BTZ case. This validation suggests that our approach can yield continuous geometries\r
from the entanglement entropy of the CFT, representing an advancement beyond the machine\r
learning analysis that produces discontinuous geometries of the BTZ black holes [77, 78].\r
Secondly, the functional form of the emergent metric derived from the fermionic tight\u0002binding chain at half filling exhibits similar aspects to that of the Gubser-Rocha model: cfr.\r
figure 7 vs. figure 12. The blackening factor f(z) attains a maximum value, forming a peak\r
between the AdS boundary and the horizon, while, the function h(z) increases monotonically\r
towards the horizon. This resemblance may not be surprising, as both models describe\r
the metallic phases. In the Gubser-Rocha model, metallic behavior is characterized by the\r
linear-temperature resistivity, whereas in the fermionic tight-binding chain, it is characterized\r
by the gapless excitations.\r
18We also confirmed that the slop of the holographic entanglement entropy in the large ℓ limit, given in\r
figure 2, 6, 9 are consistent with the thermal entropy from (2.2).\r

Figure 12. The emergent metric from the entanglement entropy of BTZ black holes (black data)\r
and fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling (blue data). Solid lines are the metric from machine\r
learning method, while dotted lines denote the true metric of BTZ black hole (4.27).\r
We conclude this section by providing a heuristic and indicative argument for the peak\r
structure of f(z) in the fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling. According to holographic\r
duality, the radial coordinate z in the bulk corresponds to the energy scale in the boundary\r
theory. Thus, a peak at some z may be interpreted as indicating a significant energy scale in\r
fermionic chain. This could represent the energy at which a density of states (DOS) peak,\r
indicating a high DOS at a particular energy level. For instance, DOS for a one-dimentional\r
fermionic tight-binding model is given by D(E) ≈ 1/\r
q\r
4t\r
2\r
h − E2, where th is the hopping\r
parameter and E is the energy [185, 186].19 This form highlights the characteristic features\r
of the DOS in such a system, indicating singularities at E = ±2th, known as Van Hove\r
singularities.\r
In this context, we speculate that a peak structure in the AdS bulk, as depicted in\r
figure 12, may be associated with features of a fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling,\r
particularly as the reminiscent of high DOS due to Van Hove singularities: E = ±2th where\r
th = 1 in our entanglement entropy data [99]. Nevertheless, the precise nature of this peak\r
within the bulk direction remains insufficiently understood and is likely influenced by the\r
specific properties of the tight-binding model under consideration as well. Therefore, our\r
argument remains speculative and a more rigorous investigation with thorough analysis are\r
required to attain a comprehensive understanding.\r
5 Conclusions\r
We have investigated the bulk reconstruction of the AdS black hole spacetime by leveraging\r
quantum entanglement measures on the boundary field theory. Notably, by incorporating a\r
neural network framework for the Ryu-Takayanagi formula within the AdS/DL correspondence,\r
we introduce a machine learning approach to uncover the dual holographic emergent bulk\r
metric from the entanglement entropy data of quantum many-body systems.\r
19Recall that the energy dispersion is E(k) = −2th cos k with k being the wavevector in the first Brillouin\r
zone, typically k ∈ [−π, π] for a one-dimensional chain. Then, DOS can be computed via D(E) = 1\r

Our analysis of various entanglement entropy datasets within a continuous and generic\r
metric configuration marks significant progress in the field of machine learning holography,\r
both practically and theoretically. By employing the neural ODE methodology together\r
with Monte-Carlo integration, our machine learning algorithm constructs a neural network\r
from the entanglement entropy data, where the continuous network geometry represents\r
the emergent holographic geometry of the quantum many-body state. Furthermore, our\r
algorithm’s ability to handle a generic metric ansatz (2.1) enhances its practical applicability,\r
enabling the use of potential experimental and simulated quantum information data from\r
strongly coupled field theories for gravity duals.\r
Before our work, the authors in [77] also applied deep learning techniques within the\r
framework of holography to deduce the bulk metric from holographic entanglement entropy.\r
They employed a residual neural network, composed of residual blocks, which produced a\r
discretized version of the holographic bulk metric. Our research has two differences from [77].\r
First, we implemented the neural ODE methodology, which utilizes a continuous function as\r
the training variable, enabling the construction of neural networks that yield a continuous\r
holographic bulk metric from the entanglement entropy data. Second, our machine learning\r
framework is capable of generating a general metric, whereas [77] dealt with a simplified metric\r
ansatz (h(z) = 1), where Bilson’s method can be advantageous. Accordingly, our method\r
may be applied to more practical and realistic gravity models of strongly coupled matter.\r
Additionally, the authors in [78] explored holographic entanglement entropy using a\r
machine learning framework, albeit with a different approach. They employed the transformer\r
algorithm, commonly used in natural language processing, to enable the machine to learn\r
patterns from large datasets and predict new inputs based on trained network. Nevertheless,\r
unlike [77] and our approach, which focus on generating the discrete/continuous bulk metric\r
from the entanglement entropy data, the approach in [78] is centered on identifying patterns in\r
the relationships between a known metric and the corresponding holographic entanglement en\u0002tropy, effectively associating the constructed network with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula itself.\r
In our study, we initially utilized holographic entanglement entropy as input data for\r
our machine learning approach. This enabled us to accurately derive the bulk metrics for\r
both the Gubser-Rocha model and holographic superconductor models, which are prominent\r
holographic models of strongly coupled quantum systems characterized by a non-trivial\r
metric where h(z) ̸= 1: see figure 7 for the case of Gubser-Rocha model and figure 10 for\r
the superconductor model.\r
Additionally, our machine learning approach successfully incorporates entanglement\r
entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional\r
systems [99], and identifies the corresponding emergent bulk metric: see figure 12. Remarkably,\r
we observed that the emergent metric exhibits a resemblance to that of the Gubser-Rocha\r
model, where h(z) increases monotonically towards the horizon and f(z) reveals an anomalous\r
peak structure. This resemblance may be attributed to the fact that both models can describe\r
metallic phases, with the Gubser-Rocha model featuring linear-temperature resistivity and\r
the fermionic tight-binding chain exhibiting gapless excitations, where electrons can move\r
freely without encountering an energy gap.\r
Our successful results indicate that, on a practical level, our algorithm enhances the\r
efficiency of modeling the emergent metric from the entanglement structure of quantum many-\r
– 26 –

body systems. Furthermore, it signifies the successful completion of the bulk reconstruction\r
program, thereby advancing our understanding of holographic emergent gravity derived\r
from quantum entanglement.\r
It is noteworthy that much of the work on metric reconstruction, including our own, has\r
been motivated by the idea that spacetime is constructed through entanglement entropy.\r
However, it has been argued that “entanglement is not enough” to fully encode spacetime [187],\r
as the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the gravity context only probes the exterior metrics of black\r
holes. To gain insight into the full geometry even interior of a black hole, it has been proposed\r
that quantum computational complexity plays a crucial role. Indeed, based on various\r
holographic complexity proposals, such as complexity=volume [187, 188], complexity=volume\r
2.0 [189], and complexity=anything [190], the internal metrics of black holes have been\r
successfully reconstructed without employing machine learning techniques [56, 57].\r
In general, understanding the internal structure of a black hole poses a captivating and\r
fundamental challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. A recent and actively studied\r
direction in holography involves examining the structure and dynamics of the black hole\r
interior, particularly near the singularity where spacetime curvature becomes infinitely intense.\r
For instance, pioneering work on the Kasner singularity in holography can be found in [191].\r
As such, exploring and reconstructing the interior geometry of a black hole using machine\r
learning holographic techniques is highly significant, not only from the perspective of quantum\r
information theory via complexity but also for advancing the study of quantum gravity. We\r
intend to pursue this line of research in future studies and plan to address it in subsequent\r
investigations.\r

A Entanglement entropy in the small subsystem size limit\r
In this section, we derive the holographic entanglement entropy (2.5) in the limit of small\r
subsystem size ℓ ≪ 1 (or small z∗). In this regime, the Ryu-Takayanagi surface is located\r
near the AdS boundary. Consequently, we consider the asymptotic AdS behavior of the\r
metric (2.1) as follows\r
f(z) = 1 + f\r

(0) z + · · · , h(z) = 1 + h\r

where f\r

(0) = h\r

(0) is the model-dependent constant. By substituting this expression for ℓ\r
into (2.4) and expanding the integrand for small z∗, we find\r

B The procedure of training the network and the error estimation\r
In this section, we discuss the training procedure employed in our machine learning approach,\r
along with the error estimation.\r
In figure 13(a)-(c), we illustrate the representative results for the holographic models,\r
namely, the linear-axion model, the Gubser-Rocha model, and the holographic superconductor\r
model, using Data 2 from (3.21) and T /Tc = 0.75. The figure clearly demonstrates that\r
throughout the training process, the metric functions f(z) and h(z) gradually converge\r
towards the values (indicated by blue lines) obtained from the holographic models: the gray\r
lines represent the metric components initialized (i.e., before training) with random values\r
on weights Wij and biases b\r
i of the deep neural networks. Additionally, in figure 13(d), we\r
depict the training procedure for the tight-binding chain model.\r
In the figure, we also present both the untrained and trained entanglement entropy data\r
for all the models under consideration. It is evident that the entanglement entropy calculated\r
with the trained metrics, represented by blue dots, closely aligns with the input entanglement\r
entropy data (depicted by the black solid line).\r
We also evaluate the loss function (4.11) estimated from our machine learning method.\r
For all datasets, we find that the values of both the first and second terms in (4.11) consistently\r
remain within the range of 10−4to 10−2 after training: for instance, see figure 14 for the\r
Gubser-Rocha model. It is expected that as these numerical values decrease further, for\r
instance to the order of 10−10, the error in our machine learning results (e.g., a small deviation\r
in the blue data in figure 10) will correspondingly diminish.\r

Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent\r
from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary\r
differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for\r
continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement\r
entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to\r
holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor\r
models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our\r
algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally,\r
we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data\r
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional\r
systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding\r
chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the\r
metallic property of these models.\r

Entanglement, a fundamental characteristic of quantum mechanics, elucidates the intriguing\r
non-local correlations between quantum entities, and is at the core of quantum information\r
sciences [1–3]. Especially, the notion of entanglement entropy now exerts a wide-ranging\r
influence, spanning from condensed matter [4] to high-energy quantum field theory [5] and\r
even extending into quantum gravity [6].\r
Within condensed matter physics, for example, entanglement entropy proves its versatility\r
as a tool, facilitating the characterization of quantum phases and the intricate dynamics\r
of strongly correlated many-body systems [7, 8]. The scaling behavior of entanglement\r
entropy [9] offers insights into phases beyond symmetry characterization, particularly useful\r
for identifying exotic states like topological phases [10–12] and spin liquids [13, 14]. Ad\u0002ditionally, entanglement entropy aids in exploring quantum criticality [15], understanding\r
non-equilibrium dynamics [16, 17], and assessing numerical techniques for efficient many-body\r
physics simulation [18].\r
Holographic entanglement entropy. Nevertheless, the concept of entanglement entropy\r
has also garnered increased attention in recent decades due to its significant role in holography\r
(AdS/CFT correspondence) [19–21]. Holography entails a duality between boundary quantum\r
field theories and bulk gravitational theories, offering a compelling framework for understand\u0002ing the emergence of spacetime geometry from quantum entanglement. Particularly notable\r

is its connection exemplified in the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula [22], which establishes a\r
relationship between the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in the boundary field theory\r
and the area of the minimal surface in the bulk corresponding to the same region.1\r
By leveraging the RT formula and understanding gravity through the lens of quantum\r
entanglement, the holographic examination of entanglement entropy not only offers a more\r
manageable approach to studying and computing this measure, but also yields general\r
lessons applicable other branches of physics such, as quantum field theories and strongly\r
coupled many-body physics [31]. For instance, the c-theorem, established in two-dimensional\r
conformal field theory, is derived from analyzing how entanglement entropy evolves under\r
renormalization group flows [32]. Also, holographic entanglement entropy proves instrumental\r
in the study of the aforementioned condensed matter physics by characterizing various phases\r
of matter, exemplified by holographic superconductors [33].2 This elucidates phenomena such\r
as phase transitions, quantum criticality, and topological order, offering valuable insights into\r
the entanglement properties of strongly correlated quantum systems.\r
Bulk reconstruction in holography. It is worth noting that, in most studies of holographic\r
entanglement entropy, the standard approach is the bottom-up methodology. In this frame\u0002work, gravitational bulk theories are employed to depict the realistic dual boundary quantum\r
systems (e.g., characterized by broken translational symmetries), and the RT formula is used\r
to study the associated entanglement entropy.\r
Nonetheless, despite significant advancements over the past decade, which provide\r
compelling evidence that the entanglement structure of the underlying quantum mechanical\r
degrees of freedom plays a pivotal role in shaping the emergent holographic spacetime\r
geometry and its dynamics, an open question remains. Specifically, it is still unclear which\r
bulk gravity model can accurately reproduces the entanglement features of a given quantum\r
system on the boundary and how to identify such models.\r
One essential approach for identifying such bulk gravity theories is termed ‘bulk recon\u0002struction’, representing a non-trivial inverse problem entailing holographic mapping from\r
lower (boundary) to higher (bulk) dimensions. A captivating aspect within this endeavor is the\r
reconstruction of the metric in the holographic spacetime.3 There are numerous methodologies\r
for bulk metric reconstruction, leveraging diverse boundary physical quantities. These include\r
the source and expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor [39], singularities in sets of\r
correlation functions [40, 41], entanglement entropy of boundary intervals [42–45],4 differential\r
entropy, a UV-finite combination of entanglement entropy [47–49], divergence structure of\r
boundary n-point functions [50, 51], modular Hamiltonians of boundary subregions [52, 53],\r
Wilson loops related to quark potential [54], four-point correlators in an excited quantum\r
1The RT formula, along with its subsequent generalizations [23–26], provides a deeper elucidation of the\r
pivotal role of entanglement in holographic duality. Another noteworthy entanglement measure is the reflected\r
entropy, which possesses a gravity dual known as the entanglement wedge cross section [27–30].\r
2Please refer to [34] for a comprehensive list of additional references regarding the investigation of\r
entanglement in diverse holographic matters.\r
3Additional significant branches can be found in [35–38], with particular emphasis on bulk operator recon\u0002struction.\r

entropy in lattice Yang-Mills theory.\r

state [55], and holographic complexities [56, 57], among others. It is noteworthy that much\r
of the research on metric reconstruction has been motivated by the notion that spacetime\r
is constructed from quantum entanglement [22, 58–62].5\r
Machine learning and holography. In recent years, machine learning has emerged as\r
a promising approach to addressing bulk reconstruction by identifying the underlying bulk\r
theory, such as reconstructing the bulk metric. Efficient holographic modeling has been\r
successfully demonstrated through the application of machine learning techniques with various\r
physical quantities, including lattice QCD data of the chiral condensate, hadron spectra,\r
meson spectrum, shear viscosity, optical conductivity, and entanglement entropy, and so\r
forth [66–86].6\r
Machine learning holography not only facilitates the construction of data-driven holo\u0002graphic models but also provides insights into deeper understanding of holography itself.\r
This approach is referred to as the AdS/DL correspondence, and establishes connections\r
between deep learning (DL) — a form of machine learning utilizing deep neural networks —\r
and holography. Here, deep learning functions as a solver for the inverse problem, enabling\r
the determination of the bulk metric upon traning the neural network. Readers interested in\r
grasping the essential concept of AdS/DL within a simplified framework are encouraged to\r
refer [91], which illustrates this concept through a classical mechanics problem.\r
Motivation of this paper. In this manuscript, we investigate the reconstruction of the\r
holographic bulk metric through machine learning of the boundary entanglement entropy.\r
Our aim is to assess the effectiveness of machine learning in this context.\r
Note that a machine learning method has been applied in related contexts [77, 78], where\r
authors inferred the dual geometry from a given entanglement entropy using the RT formula\r
and deep learning methods. However, due to inherent discontinuities in their algorithm, the\r
reconstructed metric lacks continuity. Additionally, for simplicity, the entanglement entropy\r
was assumed to have the dual geometry when only the blackening factor f(z) is unknown,\r
for instance, h(z) = 1 in (2.1). We intend to enhance this work by incorporating a neural\r
ODE approach and a more generic metric setup, i.e., any function of f(z) and h(z),\r
7 making\r
it more compatible with bulk reconstruction programs for continuous and generic metrics.\r
It is also worth mentioning that when h(z) = 1, one may not need to resort to machine\r
learning holography; instead, Bilson’s method [44] can be utilized to invert the RT formula,\r
generating the metric as output and entanglement entropy as input. Nevertheless, for\r
completeness, we review Bilson’s method in the main text and discuss its limitations when\r
h(z) ̸= 1, motivating the use of machine learning holography to find the complete metric\r
from entanglement entropy.\r
5Another notable progression in investigating bulk reconstruction in holography involves a novel approach\r
from quantum many-body systems, termed the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) of\r
tensor networks [60, 63–65].\r
6Other related works that extract the spacetime metric using machine learning, independent of holography,\r
can be found in [87–90].\r
7\r
In the scenario of isotropic geometries, (2.1) represents the most general metric setup. Specifically, metrics\r
where (gtt ̸= gzz ̸= gxx) can always be expressed in the form of (2.1) through coordinate transformations. For\r
detailed discussions, refer to [92].\r
– 3 –

JHEP01(2025)025\r
As illustrative examples for our purpose, in this study, we initially employ two represen\u0002tative holographic entanglement entropy models with h(z) ̸= 1: the Gubser-Rocha model [93]\r
and the holographic superconductor model [94, 95], where the former has been particularly\r
instrumental in examining the characteristics of strange metals.8 Moreover, in addition to\r
the aforementioned holographic matter models, we incorporate entanglement entropy data\r
from quantum many-body systems. Specifically, we utilize data obtained from a fermionic\r
tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional systems [99] to ascertain the\r
corresponding emergent bulk metric.\r
In essence, we propose applying data-driven and machine learning methodologies to unveil\r
the emergent continuous metric based on boundary entanglement entropy data. Analyzing\r
various entanglement entropy dataset within the generic and continuous metric configuration,\r
our objective is to establish machine learning holography as both a practical and theoretical\r
framework. Through our investigation, we aim to offer valuable insights into the fundamental\r
aspects of quantum entanglement, thereby deepening our understanding of many-body\r
quantum physics and potentially advancing the exploration of holographic duality.\r
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a quick review of the RT formula\r
concerning the holographic entanglement entropy. Additionally, in section 3, we discuss\r
Bilson’s method for generating the metric from entanglement entropy and address its limitation\r
in studying the complete metric. Section 4 introduces a machine learning method tailored\r
to determine the continuous/generic metric based on provided entanglement entropy. As\r
input data of machine learning method, we utilize both the holographic entanglement entropy\r
and entanglement entropy from a fermionic tight-binding chain. Finally, section 5 is devoted\r
to conclusions."""

for d = 3, it results from a consistent truncation of eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified on AdS4 ×\r
S\r
7\r
[93], while for d = 4, it is derived from ten-dimensional type IIB String Theory as the near-horizon\r
limit of D3-branes [93, 96]. See also [97, 98] for discussions on top-down holographic superconductors from\r
string/M-theory. Consequently, our study can also be regarded as an exploration of such top-down models\r
through the lens of machine learning.\r

Holographic entanglement entropy. The holographic dictionary to study the entan\u0002glement entropy (S) is the Ryu-Takayanagi formula [22, 62]. The formula allows us to\r

the corresponding region the bulk spacetime as\r

takes the form of a yellow surface with a width ℓ in x-direction and extends infinitely Ω in\r
y-directions. z∗ represents the maximal z value of this minimal surface in the bulk.\r

On the other hands, Bilson’s method [44] attempts to invert the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.4),\r
flipping the roles of metric and entanglement entropy. Here, the metric becomes the output,\r
while the entanglement entropy becomes the input.\r
Bilson’s method involves two main ingredients. Firstly, it employs the handbook of\r
integral equations [100] to express:\r
F(z∗) = Z z∗\r

The integral equation presented here shows how one function, F(z∗), can be expressed in\r
terms of another, Y (z∗), with the roles reversed in the “Solution” part of the equation.\r

The resulting expression (3.8) represents the reconstruction formula provided by Bil\u0002son [44], where S(z∗) is derived from the data S(ℓ), with ℓ interchangeable with z∗ through (3.9).\r
Essentially, given the entanglement entropy S(ℓ), the metric component f(z) can be gen\u0002erated as the output.\r
Reconstruction formula II. Although (3.8) presents a novel approach, the entangle\u0002ment entropy data S(ℓ) predominantly hinges on the UV cutoff ϵ. Hence, from a practical\r
standpoint, it proves beneficial [57] to employ an alternative reconstruction formula de\u0002rived from the subsystem size in (2.4). Analogous to the entanglement entropy scenario,\r

also represents a scenario where the input data is the entanglement entropy.\r

Example: pure AdS geometry. To better understand the application of the reconstruction\r
formula, we consider an example where the analytic expression for the entanglement entropy\r
is available. For the pure AdS geometry by\r
f(z) = 1 , (3.11)\r
the entanglement entropy (2.4) can be analytically obtained as\r

As the initial step of Bilson’s method, we can first put the given the entanglement entropy\r

Then, by plugging this expression into the reconstruction formula (3.10), we can deduce\r
f(r) = 1 , (3.14)\r
which is consistent with the expected pure AdS metric, as given in (3.11).\r
Limitation of Bilson’s method. While Bilson’s method offers a structured approach\r
to reconstructing the metric, it is not without its limitations. It is straightforward to find\r
that for the generic metric where\r
h(z) ̸= 1 , (3.15)\r

Then, one can notice that the reconstruction program cannot proceed due to the inconsistency\r
between the number of input data and output data. In other words, given a single data\r
S(ℓ), one needs to determine two functions f(z) and h(z). Therefore, unless h(z) is provided,\r
Bilson’s method cannot fully reconstruct the metric.\r
Nevertheless, this limitation is not surprising, as previously noted [44]. An alternative\r

As discussed in the introduction, the machine learning holography framework, also known as\r
the AdS/DL correspondence, has been employed in elucidating the holographic bulk theory\r
that underpins quantum systems on the boundary.\r
In the pioneering studies of the AdS/DL correspondence [66, 67], significant advancements\r
have primarily been achieved by discretizing the holographic bulk metric using deep learning\r
techniques. For example, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) can be solved within\r
the framework of a residual neural network (ResNet) [166], which is composed of residual\r
blocks [167].\r
In recent years, to achieve a continuous holographic bulk spacetime, a continuous version\r
of ResNet, known as the neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) [168], has been\r
developed. By employing neural ODEs in machine learning holography, the continuous bulk\r
metric has been reconstructed using boundary data, as demonstrated in the contexts of\r
quantum chromodynamics [72] and strongly interacting condensed matter systems [80, 81].\r
Neural ODEs. In this paper, we utilize the neural ODE framework within the context\r
of the holographic study of quantum information, with a particular focus on entanglement\r
entropy. Our machine learning methodology represents an integrated version of the neural\r
ODE, which we refer to as neural integration.\r
First, let us briefly review the concept of the ResNet using a simple ODE example:\r
∂zF = G(z, F; θ(z)), (4.1)\r
where F is the unknown function of z, G is a given function. Here, θ(z) represents a general\r
hidden function within the ODE, which serves as the trainable parameters in the neural\r
network. This equation can be solved using ODE solvers by discretizing the z interval into\r
small steps ∆z. For example, if we choose the Euler method as the solver, the approximate\r
numerical solution FN is given by\r
FN = F1 +\r
N\r
X−1\r
n=1\r
G(zn, Fn; θn) · ∆z , (4.2)\r
where the z interval is discretized into N steps, and F1 is the given initial value at z1 (for\r
more details, see [80]). Due to this discretization, the training parameters are also discretized;\r
for instance, θn(zn) could be the discretized metric fn(zn). This is the fundamental concept\r
of ResNet for generating the discretized bulk metric [66, 67].\r
The approximate numerical solution F can be more generally expressed as:\r
Ffinal = ODE Solver[G; Finitial, (zfinal, zinitial); θ(z)] . (4.3)\r
For instance, for the Euler method described in (4.2), we have\r
(Finitial, Ffinal) = (F1, FN ) and (zinitial, zfinal) = (1, N − 1), (4.4)\r
with the training parameter θ chosen as θn for the ResNet.\r

Figure 4. A structure of a deep neural network. It consists of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each.\r
The nodes are fully connected each other. Through the learning procedure, the continuous function\r
D(z) is generated where the input is z =: z\r
1\r
0\r
.\r
To ensure that the discrete hidden function becomes a continuous function, the central\r
idea of neural ODEs [168] is to replace the discrete parameter θ(z) = θn(zn) with a continuous\r
deep neural network θ(z) = D(z). This deep neural network consists of multiple layers through\r
which data is processed, including an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer.\r
The deep neural network is defined as follows\r
D(z) = WM · ϕ(· · · ϕ(W2 · ϕ(W1z + b1) + b2)· · ·) + bM , (4.5)\r
where ϕ is an activation function, WM is the weight matrix of M-th layer, and bM is the bias\r
vector of M-th layer. The activation function is a non-linear function applied to the output of\r
each layer, enabling the network to model complex patterns. In this paper, we use the rectified\r
linear unit (ReLU) as the activation function: ReLU(z) = max(0, z). The other parameters\r
(weights and biases) are adjusted during training to minimize errors in the loss function.\r
Continuous training variables in deep neural networks, primarily weights and biases,\r
are essential for the learning process. Weights determine the “strength” of connections\r
between nodes, while biases provide each layer with a trainable constant value to help the\r
model fit the data better. For an illustrative sketch of a deep neural network, see figure 4,\r
which shows the case of 3 hidden layers with 3 nodes each. By employing iterative forward\r
and backward propagation steps, along with optimization algorithms, these variables are\r
continuously refined to minimize errors and enhance the model’s efficacy.\r
In our deep neural network computations, we utilize the PyTorch framework [169], an\r
open-source machine learning library, and deep neural networks are initialized with 3 hidden\r
layers, each containing 20 nodes.\r
Neural integrations. In this manuscript, drawing inspiration from solving ODEs using deep\r
neural networks, we introduce a method for solving integrations through machine learning\r
techniques. Termed “neural integration,” this approach aligns well with our objective:\r
employing machine learning holography to analyze entanglement entropy (2.5).\r
To demonstrate further, let us consider the following integration, which can be obtained\r
by equation (4.1):\r

and the provided input data SFinite(ℓ). The second term, referred to as the penalty term,\r

In principle, alternative penalty terms could be chosen. However, opting for the thermal\r

be inferred from the large subsystem size limit as SFinite ≈ s ℓ [22, 62]. Furthermore, through\r
the utilization of thermal entropy, an additional horizon condition on h(1) can be introduced\r
via (2.2), complementing the demonstration provided below (4.9). Thus, in aggregate, we have\r

To initiate our machine learning methodology, we initially compute the holographic\r
entanglement entropy. Since the Gubser-Rocha model entails two free parameters: (µ, β),\r
akin to the linear-axion model (3.19), we opt for the same dataset (3.21).\r
Subsequently, by substituting (4.13) into (2.5), one can compute the entanglement entropy\r
numerically. Employing the parameters specified in (3.21), we depict SFinite in figure 6, where\r
we find its compatibility with (3.22) when fitted, with coefficients detailed in table 2.\r
It is worth noting that the value of c0 for the Gubser-Rocha model is finite, unlike\r
that for the linear-axion model as shown in table 1. To elucidate this distinction, we\r
analytically investigate c0 for our metric (2.1) in the limit of a small subsystems, as detailed\r
in appendix A. Specifically, we examine c0 as follows\r
c0 =\r
h\r
′\r

. (4.16)\r
We observe that when h(z) = 1, c0 equals 0, consistent with the numerical findings in the\r
linear-axion model. Conversely, when h(z) ̸= 1, c0 can be non-zero. This is evident in the\r
case of the Gubser-Rocha model (4.13): we checked that our numerical results in table 2\r
align with the analytical formula (4.16).\r
Finally, we plug data obtained from the holographic entanglement entropy of the Gubser\u0002Rocha model into the machine learning framework, utilizing the fitting data described\r
by (3.22) and the corresponding coefficients outlined in table 2. Subsequently, in figure 7,\r

geometry f(z) and h(z) within the holographic bulk spacetime. This validation underscores the\r

one of the most widely studied frameworks in applied holography to condensed matter systems,\r
garnering significant attention in the field (for comprehensive reviews, refer to [174, 175]).\r
Precisely speaking, the U(1) symmetry in the dual field theory of the HHH model is global\r
rather than local, characterizing it as a superfluid rather than a superconductor. While some\r
aspects, such as electric conductivity, may not distinguish between the two, other features, such\r
as the dynamics of vortices and collective low-energy modes, markedly differentiate between a\r
superfluid and a superconductor. For instance, collective excitations in holographic superfluids\r
are second sound waves (superfluid Goldstone mode) [176, 177] which are absence in the\r
superconductors. Explorations of collective excitations in holographic superconductors are\r

one can discern between the superconducting phase, characterized by Φ\r
(+) ̸= 0, and a normal\r
phase, where Φ = 0, by computing the temperatures using (2.2). We present the plot of the\r

accurately capturing the entire geometry, even in scenarios where h(z) ̸= 1. The error\r
estimation analysis for the holographic superconductor model is given in appendix B.\r
It is worth noting that the functional form of h(z) for superconductors differs from that\r
of the Gubser-Rocha model (cfr. figure 10 vs. figure 7): h(z) monotonically decreases towards\r
the horizon for superconductor models, unlike the Gubser-Rocha model. Nonetheless, we\r
find that our machine learning approach can adeptly reconstruct all types of h(z)."""

rescaling βv to β, one may eliminate the depencence on group velocity in the formula.\r
However, we do not adopt this approach, as it has been reported that the group velocity\r

As a supplementary note, it is worth mentioning the following. Let us consider the entan\u0002glement entropy S pertaining to the bipartition of a one-dimensional quantum many-body\r
system into a subsystem of length ℓ. When the system parameters and energy (temperature)\r
fall within a quantum critical regime of the model under consideration, established principles\r
dictate that the entanglement entropy may adhere to a universal scaling function [181–183].\r
Notably, in [99], it has been demonstrated that for the typical quantum many-body\r
systems complying with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, the entanglement entropy\r
of eigenstates can be characterized by a universal scaling function. Particularly, in critical\r
one-dimensional systems with linear dispersion at low energies, a universal scaling function\r
follows from CFT.16\r
In this paper, within machine learning framework, we focus on analyzing data obtained\r
from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling [99], where it has been demonstrated\r
to adhere to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and is describable by a CFT with\r
c = 1. Notably, the entanglement entropy data SDATA from this chain is found to be with\r
parameters (c, v) = (1, 2) in (4.33): see figure 11.\r
Furthermore, in our machine learning method, for the sake of comparison, we also\r
investigate the BTZ case (4.29). In essense, we have two datasets available:\r
(c, v, β) =\r
\r
\r
\r
(24π, 1, 2π), (BTZ case)\r
(1, 2, 1), (Fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling)\r
(4.34)\r
where c = 3L/(2GN ) with L = 16πGN = 1 is employed for the BTZ case.17 Note that the\r
data from [99], figure 11, is scaled with the inverse temperature β. This can be accommodated\r
within the machine learning process by setting a fixed β,\r
β =\r
1\r
T\r
= −\r
4π\r
f\r
′(1) := 1 , (4.35)\r
where (4.24) is utilized.\r
15In principle, SDATA may contain a non-universal constant, which does not affect the scaling behavior\r
of ℓ and, therefore, is also not explicitly specified in [99]. Similarly, we omit such a term in our analysis.\r
Notably, in the study of entanglement entropy, examining the derivative of S with respect to the spatial size\r
of the entalgment region ℓ can prove advantageous. This approach, as suggested by [179], offers data that are\r
unaffected by the UV cutoff, thereby also avoiding the appearance of a non-universal constant.\r
16The presence of gapless excitations can be indicative of a critical point. At this point, the system does\r
not have a well-defined energy scale (gap) and exhibits critical fluctuations over all length scales. In a\r
one-dimensional fermionic chain, the critical point manifests as a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi\r
points k = ±π/2 as E(k) ≈ vF (k ∓ π/2), leading to low-energy excitations where vF is the Fermi velocity.\r
17Combining (4.32) with (4.33), one can notice that c does not play any role in SFinite. Nevertheless, we set\r
L = 16πGN = 1 and β = 2π in order for the metric of the BTZ black hole (4.27). It is noteworthy that the\r
central charge c can appear in our machine learning method through the thermal entropy (4.36).\r

Figure 11. SDATA for fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling [99], where (4.33) is used\r
with (c, v) = (1, 2).\r
Last but not least, it is worth noting that in our machine learning method aimed at\r
determining the complete metric, we utilize information of the thermal entropy s in (4.24).\r
When dealing with data, obtaining such thermal entropy is straightforward, as it can be\r
derived from the slope of the entanglement entropy in the large subsystem size limit [99]\r
(ℓ ≫ 1) : S ≈ SDATA ≈ s ℓ , −→ s =\r
cπ\r
3βv , (4.36)\r
where we employ (4.33), which aligns with holography [22, 62].18 Intuitively, when ℓ ≫ 1\r
the subsystem effectively encompasses the entire system, implying that the minimal surface\r
lies along the black hole horizon [45, 184], suggesting a potential connection between the\r
Ryu-Takayanagi formula (2.3) and the thermal entropy density s.\r
Finally, we utilize data obtained from the entanglement entropy of a fermionic tight\u0002binding chain at half filling, as depicted in figure 11, into our machine learning framework.\r
Subsequently, as illustrated in figure 12, we demonstrate how our machine learning method\u0002ology adeptly uncovers the complete black hole geometry f(z) and h(z), even leveraging\r
entanglement entropy data from quantum many-body systems.\r
Two noteworthy findings are made from our analysis. Firstly, as demonstrated in figure 12,\r
our machine learning method accurately captures the dual geometry of the CFT, specifically\r
in the BTZ case. This validation suggests that our approach can yield continuous geometries\r
from the entanglement entropy of the CFT, representing an advancement beyond the machine\r
learning analysis that produces discontinuous geometries of the BTZ black holes [77, 78].\r
Secondly, the functional form of the emergent metric derived from the fermionic tight\u0002binding chain at half filling exhibits similar aspects to that of the Gubser-Rocha model: cfr.\r
figure 7 vs. figure 12. The blackening factor f(z) attains a maximum value, forming a peak\r
between the AdS boundary and the horizon, while, the function h(z) increases monotonically\r
towards the horizon. This resemblance may not be surprising, as both models describe\r
the metallic phases. In the Gubser-Rocha model, metallic behavior is characterized by the\r
linear-temperature resistivity, whereas in the fermionic tight-binding chain, it is characterized\r
by the gapless excitations.\r
18We also confirmed that the slop of the holographic entanglement entropy in the large ℓ limit, given in\r
figure 2, 6, 9 are consistent with the thermal entropy from (2.2).\r

and fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling (blue data). Solid lines are the metric from machine\r
learning method, while dotted lines denote the true metric of BTZ black hole (4.27).\r
We conclude this section by providing a heuristic and indicative argument for the peak\r
structure of f(z) in the fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling. According to holographic\r
duality, the radial coordinate z in the bulk corresponds to the energy scale in the boundary\r
theory. Thus, a peak at some z may be interpreted as indicating a significant energy scale in\r
fermionic chain. This could represent the energy at which a density of states (DOS) peak,\r
indicating a high DOS at a particular energy level. For instance, DOS for a one-dimentional\r
fermionic tight-binding model is given by D(E) ≈ 1/\r
q\r
4t\r
2\r
h − E2, where th is the hopping\r
parameter and E is the energy [185, 186].19 This form highlights the characteristic features\r
of the DOS in such a system, indicating singularities at E = ±2th, known as Van Hove\r
singularities.\r
In this context, we speculate that a peak structure in the AdS bulk, as depicted in\r
figure 12, may be associated with features of a fermionic tight-binding chain at half-filling,\r
particularly as the reminiscent of high DOS due to Van Hove singularities: E = ±2th where\r
th = 1 in our entanglement entropy data [99]. Nevertheless, the precise nature of this peak\r
within the bulk direction remains insufficiently understood and is likely influenced by the\r
specific properties of the tight-binding model under consideration as well. Therefore, our\r
argument remains speculative and a more rigorous investigation with thorough analysis are\r
required to attain a comprehensive understanding."""

Our analysis of various entanglement entropy datasets within a continuous and generic\r
metric configuration marks significant progress in the field of machine learning holography,\r
both practically and theoretically. By employing the neural ODE methodology together\r
with Monte-Carlo integration, our machine learning algorithm constructs a neural network\r
from the entanglement entropy data, where the continuous network geometry represents\r
the emergent holographic geometry of the quantum many-body state. Furthermore, our\r
algorithm’s ability to handle a generic metric ansatz (2.1) enhances its practical applicability,\r
enabling the use of potential experimental and simulated quantum information data from\r
strongly coupled field theories for gravity duals.\r
Before our work, the authors in [77] also applied deep learning techniques within the\r
framework of holography to deduce the bulk metric from holographic entanglement entropy.\r
They employed a residual neural network, composed of residual blocks, which produced a\r
discretized version of the holographic bulk metric. Our research has two differences from [77].\r
First, we implemented the neural ODE methodology, which utilizes a continuous function as\r
the training variable, enabling the construction of neural networks that yield a continuous\r
holographic bulk metric from the entanglement entropy data. Second, our machine learning\r
framework is capable of generating a general metric, whereas [77] dealt with a simplified metric\r
ansatz (h(z) = 1), where Bilson’s method can be advantageous. Accordingly, our method\r
may be applied to more practical and realistic gravity models of strongly coupled matter.\r
Additionally, the authors in [78] explored holographic entanglement entropy using a\r
machine learning framework, albeit with a different approach. They employed the transformer\r
algorithm, commonly used in natural language processing, to enable the machine to learn\r
patterns from large datasets and predict new inputs based on trained network. Nevertheless,\r
unlike [77] and our approach, which focus on generating the discrete/continuous bulk metric\r
from the entanglement entropy data, the approach in [78] is centered on identifying patterns in\r
the relationships between a known metric and the corresponding holographic entanglement en\u0002tropy, effectively associating the constructed network with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula itself.\r
In our study, we initially utilized holographic entanglement entropy as input data for\r
our machine learning approach. This enabled us to accurately derive the bulk metrics for\r
both the Gubser-Rocha model and holographic superconductor models, which are prominent\r
holographic models of strongly coupled quantum systems characterized by a non-trivial\r
metric where h(z) ̸= 1: see figure 7 for the case of Gubser-Rocha model and figure 10 for\r
the superconductor model.\r
Additionally, our machine learning approach successfully incorporates entanglement\r
entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling in critical one-dimensional\r
systems [99], and identifies the corresponding emergent bulk metric: see figure 12. Remarkably,\r
we observed that the emergent metric exhibits a resemblance to that of the Gubser-Rocha\r
model, where h(z) increases monotonically towards the horizon and f(z) reveals an anomalous\r
peak structure. This resemblance may be attributed to the fact that both models can describe\r
metallic phases, with the Gubser-Rocha model featuring linear-temperature resistivity and\r
the fermionic tight-binding chain exhibiting gapless excitations, where electrons can move\r
freely without encountering an energy gap.\r
Our successful results indicate that, on a practical level, our algorithm enhances the\r
efficiency of modeling the emergent metric from the entanglement structure of quantum many-\r
– 26 –

body systems. Furthermore, it signifies the successful completion of the bulk reconstruction\r
program, thereby advancing our understanding of holographic emergent gravity derived\r
from quantum entanglement.\r
It is noteworthy that much of the work on metric reconstruction, including our own, has\r
been motivated by the idea that spacetime is constructed through entanglement entropy.\r
However, it has been argued that “entanglement is not enough” to fully encode spacetime [187],\r
as the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the gravity context only probes the exterior metrics of black\r
holes. To gain insight into the full geometry even interior of a black hole, it has been proposed\r
that quantum computational complexity plays a crucial role. Indeed, based on various\r
holographic complexity proposals, such as complexity=volume [187, 188], complexity=volume\r
2.0 [189], and complexity=anything [190], the internal metrics of black holes have been\r
successfully reconstructed without employing machine learning techniques [56, 57].\r
In general, understanding the internal structure of a black hole poses a captivating and\r
fundamental challenge, both theoretically and experimentally. A recent and actively studied\r
direction in holography involves examining the structure and dynamics of the black hole\r
interior, particularly near the singularity where spacetime curvature becomes infinitely intense.\r
For instance, pioneering work on the Kasner singularity in holography can be found in [191].\r
As such, exploring and reconstructing the interior geometry of a black hole using machine\r
learning holographic techniques is highly significant, not only from the perspective of quantum\r
information theory via complexity but also for advancing the study of quantum gravity. We\r
intend to pursue this line of research in future studies and plan to address it in subsequent\r
investigations.\r

A Entanglement entropy in the small subsystem size limit\r
In this section, we derive the holographic entanglement entropy (2.5) in the limit of small\r
subsystem size ℓ ≪ 1 (or small z∗). In this regime, the Ryu-Takayanagi surface is located\r
near the AdS boundary. Consequently, we consider the asymptotic AdS behavior of the\r
metric (2.1) as follows\r
f(z) = 1 + f\r
′\r
(0) z + · · · , h(z) = 1 + h\r
′\r
(0) z + · · · , (A.1)\r
where f\r
′\r
(0) = h\r
′\r
(0) is the model-dependent constant. By substituting this expression for ℓ\r
into (2.4) and expanding the integrand for small z∗, we find\r
ℓ = z∗\r

which holds for small ℓ. Similarly, utilizing (A.1) and (A.2), we can analytically compute\r
the holographic entanglement entropy (2.5) in the small ℓ limit as\r

where · · · denotes the O(ℓ) correction, which can be obtained by considering the z\r
2 order in\r
the metric in (A.1). Comparing (3.22) with (A.3), we can determine c0 as (4.16).\r
B The procedure of training the network and the error estimation\r
In this section, we discuss the training procedure employed in our machine learning approach,\r
along with the error estimation.\r
In figure 13(a)-(c), we illustrate the representative results for the holographic models,\r
namely, the linear-axion model, the Gubser-Rocha model, and the holographic superconductor\r
model, using Data 2 from (3.21) and T /Tc = 0.75. The figure clearly demonstrates that\r
throughout the training process, the metric functions f(z) and h(z) gradually converge\r
towards the values (indicated by blue lines) obtained from the holographic models: the gray\r
lines represent the metric components initialized (i.e., before training) with random values\r
on weights Wij and biases b\r
i of the deep neural networks. Additionally, in figure 13(d), we\r
depict the training procedure for the tight-binding chain model.\r
In the figure, we also present both the untrained and trained entanglement entropy data\r
for all the models under consideration. It is evident that the entanglement entropy calculated\r
with the trained metrics, represented by blue dots, closely aligns with the input entanglement\r
entropy data (depicted by the black solid line).\r
We also evaluate the loss function (4.11) estimated from our machine learning method.\r
For all datasets, we find that the values of both the first and second terms in (4.11) consistently\r
remain within the range of 10−4to 10−2 after training: for instance, see figure 14 for the\r
Gubser-Rocha model. It is expected that as these numerical values decrease further, for\r
instance to the order of 10−10, the error in our machine learning results (e.g., a small deviation\r
in the blue data in figure 10) will correspondingly diminish.\r
