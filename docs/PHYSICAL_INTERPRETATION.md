# Physical Interpretation: The Sedenion Vacuum & Mass Quantization

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Theory Status:** Speculative hypothesis (not statistically validated)

This document contains a narrative mapping from a toy "negative dimension" operator study to
astrophysical mass scales. Treat all physical conclusions here as **unverified** unless backed by
first-party sources and a reproducible statistical test against appropriate null models (see
`docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`, especially C-007/C-008/C-012).

## 1. The Mass Ladder Hypothesis
Our spectral analysis of a toy, analytically-continued "dimension-like" operator parameter ($D = -1.5$) yields a discrete mass spectrum (scope note: `docs/NEGATIVE_DIMENSION_CLARIFICATIONS.md`):
$$ M_n = m_0 \cdot n^{1.5} $$
Calibrating with LIGO O3 data ($n=10 \leftrightarrow 35 M_{\odot}$), we derive a fundamental mass quantum $m_0 \approx 1.1 M_{\odot}$.

### Key Mode Correlations
*   **$n=10$ ($35.0 M_{\odot}$):** Aligns with the primary LIGO BH population peak.
*   **$n=15$ ($64.3 M_{\odot}$):** Aligns with the secondary peak/merger remnants.
*   **$n=25$ ($138.4 M_{\odot}$):** Lies near the upper end of the commonly discussed PISN gap range (interpretive; needs citations + a formal test).

### Interpretation of the PISN Gap ($50 - 120 M_{\odot}$)
In standard astrophysics, this gap is caused by photon-disintegration in stellar cores. In Sedenion theory, we observe that the modes $n=15$ to $n=25$ span this range.
*   **Hypothesis:** The Sedenion Zero-Divisor graph has a structural "void" or instability between indices 15 and 25 (related to the transition from Sedenions to Pathions at $n=32$?).
*   **Prediction:** Black holes *can* exist in the gap (as we see modes there), but they are statistically suppressed because the vacuum "Box-Kite" stability is lower for these intermediate $n$.

## 2. Dark Energy as Negative Dimension Diffusion
Standard diffusion ($D > 0$) spreads energy out ($\Delta x \sim t^{1/2}$).
In this toy model, the chosen parameterization ($D = -1.5$) can correspond to concentration-like behavior in the simulated operator dynamics.
*   **Cosmological Implication:** If the vacuum has dimension $D < 0$, it exerts a "negative pressure" that resists dispersion. On the scale of the universe, this "anti-entropy" force manifests as an accelerated expansion (Dark Energy) because the vacuum tries to "clump" space itself, pulling the horizon away.

## 3. The Chandrasekhar Connection
The fundamental mass $m_0 \approx 1.1 M_{\odot}$ is remarkably close to the **Chandrasekhar Limit** ($\sim 1.4 M_{\odot}$) for white dwarf stability.
*   **Interpretation (speculative):** This numerical proximity could be coincidence; treat it as a hypothesis until supported by a derivation tied to established stellar-structure physics.

## 4. Synthesis
Synthesis (metaphor / hypothesis):
The Universe is described as a **"Sedenion Crystal"** in this narrative.
*   **Nodes:** Black Holes (Stable Solitons at $n=10, 15, 25$).
*   **Bulk:** Dark Energy (Negative Dimension Anti-Diffusion pressure).
*   **Defects:** Matter ($m_0$).
