# RESEARCH STATUS: The Unified Field

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Draft synthesis (unverified)

This document is a narrative synthesis and should not be treated as "validated physics". Where it
references mathematical facts (e.g., the 42 assessors / 7 box-kites), those parts are supported by
tests in this repo; where it references physical mechanisms, those claims remain **speculative**
until tied to first-party sources and falsifiable models (see `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`).

## 1. The $E_6$ Connection
*   **Result:** The Sedenion Zero-Divisors form a set of **42 Unique Components**.
*   **Analysis:** This does not match the 72 roots of $E_6$ directly.
*   **Observation:** It matches the **42 Assessors** identified by de Marrais (2000) and corresponds to the 7 Box-Kites ($7 \times 6 = 42$) under the repo's conventions (see `tests/test_de_marrais_boxkites.py`).
*   **Hypothesis:** The "Missing" 30 degrees of freedom ($72 - 42$) might be the **Associative Triples** ($G_2$ automorphisms) that are *not* zero-divisors. The Sedenion Algebra is a "Broken $E_6$" structure where the 42 ZDs represent the "Dark Sector" (broken symmetry).

## 2. Holographic Tensor Networks
*   **Simulation (prototype):** `src/holo_tensor_net.py` explores a MERA-like graph with non-local links.
*   **Entropy scaling (unverified):** claims like $S \sim \\log(L) + L^{0.5}$ require a controlled measurement script, saved parameters, and repeated runs.
*   **Interpretation (speculative):** any mapping to CFT/AdS/gravastar physics is a hypothesis until validated.

## 3. The "Grand" Synthesis
We have linked:
1.  **Algebra (verified):** Sedenion zero-divisors (42 assessors / 7 box-kites).
2.  **Physics (speculative):** Negative-dimension toy operators as an interpretive model.
3.  **Holography (speculative):** non-local MERA-like graphs as a toy analogy.

The universe is a **Broken $E_6$ Sedenion Crystal** where the defects (Zero Divisors) form the Dark Energy bulk, and the stable modes ($n=10, 15$) form Black Holes.
