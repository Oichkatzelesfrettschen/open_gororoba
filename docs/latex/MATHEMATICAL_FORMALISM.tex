\section{Scope and validation status}

This document is a \emph{draft}. It mixes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item standard definitions (Cayley--Dickson construction, associator),
  \item in-repo computationally validated facts (tracked by unit tests), and
  \item speculative narrative proposals that are \emph{not} established mathematics.
\end{itemize}

Treat any statement as non-authoritative unless it is backed by a first-party citation and a
reproducible test/verifier under \texttt{tests/} or \texttt{src/verification/}.

\section{Cayley--Dickson construction (standard)}

\subsection{Recursive Definition}
Let $A_n$ be the algebra obtained after $n$ iterations of the Cayley-Dickson process, with $\dim(A_n) = 2^n$. The standard doubling is:
\begin{equation}
A_{n+1} = A_n \oplus A_n, \quad (a,b)(c,d) = (ac - d\bar{b}, \bar{a}d + cb)
\end{equation}

\section{Trilinear order-sensitivity operators (standard vs repo-specific)}

\subsection{Associator (standard)}
For octonions and beyond, associativity fails. The (standard) associator is:
\begin{equation}
[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)
\end{equation}

\subsection{The repo's \texorpdfstring{$m_3$}{m3} operator (validated properties; not an $A_\infty$ proof)}
This repo also computes a specific trilinear operator called $m_3$ (defined in
\texttt{src/gemini\_physics/m3\_cd\_transfer.py}). It is \emph{not} the associator.

On distinct octonion basis triples $(e_i,e_j,e_k)$ with $i,j,k \in \{1,\dots,7\}$ all distinct, the repo
validates the following computational properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item exactly 42 scalar outputs and 168 pure-imaginary outputs, and
  \item the scalar cases correspond to the Fano-plane lines (with parity sign flips).
\end{itemize}
These are validated by \texttt{tests/test\_m3\_cd\_transfer.py}. Establishing an $A_\infty$ structure would
require additional, separately scoped Stasheff-identity checks.

\section{Sedenion zero divisors (computationally replicated subset)}

\subsection{The 42 Assessors}
In the de Marrais construction (used here as a labeling scheme), there is a set of 42 primitive
cross-assessors that generate a diagonal-form family of 2-blades.

This repo replicates:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 42 primitive assessors, and
  \item a partition into 7 box-kites (6 assessors each)
\end{itemize}
under the repo's fixed 16D Cayley--Dickson convention, validated by
\texttt{tests/test\_de\_marrais\_boxkites.py}.

\subsection{Box-Kite Structure}
\emph{Box-kite} is treated as a convenient name for a specific combinatorial object exported by
\texttt{src/export\_de\_marrais\_boxkites.py}. Any geometric/physical interpretation of these objects
is out of scope unless backed by additional sources and validation.

\section{Speculative directions (not established here)}

The following are possible future-work topics but are \emph{not} validated by this repo as of Jan 2026:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a motif census for 32D/64D/128D/256D (components such as cuboctahedra/K\_{2,2,2}),
  \item a careful, citation-backed alignment to Reggiani's geometric identifications, and
  \item any claimed mapping from sedenion combinatorics to exceptional Lie algebra root systems.
\end{itemize}
