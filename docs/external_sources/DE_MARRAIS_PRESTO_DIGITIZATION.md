## Key Contributions

### 1. XOR Master Key for Index Multiplication

The *product of two 2^N-ion units* has as *its index the XOR of the indices*
of the units producing it. Example: i_7 * i_12 = +/- i_{7 XOR 12} = +/- i_11.

This is the foundational rule for all Cayley-Dickson algebras. Signs (not
indices) are what require the complex machinery of production rules.

### 2. Trip Generation Rules

**Rule 0 (Inherited trips):** All associative triplets from prior CDP
generations remain valid in all higher 2^N-ions. The 7 octonion NATO
triplets (1,2,3); (1,4,5); (1,7,6); (2,4,6); (2,5,7); (3,4,7); (3,6,5)
persist in all higher dimensions.

**Rule 1 (Generator trips):** The generator **G** = 2^N (the unique unit of
index 2^N in the 2^{N+1}-ions) produces same-signed resultants for all units
on the same side of the comma. For each unit with index L < G, the CPO
trip is (L, G, G+L). This completely explains quaternion indexing and
produces 3 of the 7 new octonion trips from the single quaternion trip.

**Rule 2 (Swap rule):** From any Rule 0 trip, hold one index fixed, add G to
the other two, and *switch their positions*. For octonions with G=4,
fixing 1,2,3 in the quaternion trip (1,2,3): (1, 3+4, 2+4) = (1,7,6);
(3+4, 2, 1+4) = (7,2,5) -> CPO (2,5,7); (2+4, 1+4, 3) = (6,5,3) -> CPO (3,6,5).

### 3. Trip Count Formula

Total trips in 2^N-ions = (2^N - 1)(2^N - 2) / 3!

- Quaternions (N=2): 1
- Octonions (N=3): 7
- Sedenions (N=4): 35
- Pathions (N=5): 155
- Chingons (N=6): 651

### 4. Zero-Divisor Construction Rule

For primitive ZDs in sedenions: take one unit with index L < G (7 choices,
any octonion), pair with one unit with index U > G where U is *not* the XOR
of L with G (6 choices each). This gives 7 * 6 = 42 Assessors.

### 5. Box-Kite-to-Semiotic-Square Mapping (ZD-Net Hypothesis)

Five-step mapping between ZD structures and Greimas's Semiotic Square:
1. ZDs inhibit synonymy -> "meaning effects" from Sails and Box-Kites
2. Strut-opposites (which do NOT zero-divide) and their 4 units obey
   "XOR arithmetic" equivalent to the Semiotic Square
3. Sails contain non-ZD substructures: Q-copies (associative triplets)
   and their "Sailing partners"
4. "Trip Sync" property enables "message passing" between Zigzag Q-copies
   through shared Assessors in Trefoils
5. The simplest non-elementary Catastrophe form (Equilateral) underwriting
   "higher harmonics" of Box-Kite representation

### 6. N-Squares Norms and Bott Periodicity

The n-squares norm law for 2^N-ions: (N, N, N) for N <= 8.
For sedenions (N=4): the (16, 16, 32) rule (Hurwitz's "at worst").
For higher ions (N = 3+k >= 4): **(2^N, 2^N, 2^{N+k})** -- 8D modularity.
This is the "Bott periodicity" signature.
