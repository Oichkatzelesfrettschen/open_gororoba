## Key Content

### Box-Kite Group Structure

The 7 box-kites in the sedenions are organized by a group structure inherited
from the octonion multiplication rules. The "placeholder" substructures are
specific arrangements of assessor indices that reveal deep number-theoretic
connections.

### Connection to Simplicial Dynamics

The paper connects the combinatorial structure of box-kite vertices and edges
to simplicial dynamics, showing that the topology of the ZD interaction graph
has interpretable dynamical properties.

### Key Theorem

The 42 primitive assessors partition into exactly 7 isomorphic octahedral
structures (box-kites), each characterized by a unique "missing" octonion
index (the strut constant). This is a concrete realization of Moreno's
abstract G_2 homomorphism result.

Abstract Methods for studying zero-divisors (ZD's) in 2n -ions generated by Cayley-Dickson process beyond the
Sedenions are explored. Prior work showed a ZD system in the Sedenions, based on 7 octahedral lattices ("Box-
Kites"), whose 6 vertices collect and partition the "42 Assessors" (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure
imaginaries, one a pure Octonion, hence of subscript < 8, the other a Sedenion of subscript > 8 and not the XOR
with 8 of the chosen Octonion). Potential connections to fundamental objects in physics (e.g., the curvature tensor
and pair creation) are suggested. Structures found in the 32-ions ("Pathions") are elicited next. Harmonics of Box-
Kites, called here "Kite-Chain Middens," are shown to extend indefinitely into higher forms of 2n -ions. All non-
Midden-collected ZD diagonals in the Pathions, meanwhile, are seen belonging to a set of 15 "emanation tables,"
dubbed "sand mandalas." Showcasing the workings of the DMZ's (dyads making zero) among the products of each
of their 14 Asses sors with each other, they house 168 fillable cells each (the number of elements in the simple group
PSL(2,7) governing Octonion multiplication). 7 of these emanation tables, whose "inner XOR" of their axis -pairs'
indices exceed 24, indicate modes of collapsing from higher to lower 2n -ion forms, as they can be "folded up" in a 1-
to-1 manner onto the 7 Sedenion Box-Kites. These same 7 also display surprising patterns of DMZ sparsity (with
but 72 of 168 available cells filled), with the animation-like sequencing obtaining between these 7 "still-shots"
indicating an entry-point for cellular-automata-like thinking into the foundations of number theory.

 {0} Review of Prior Results, Motivations for Future Work: Zero divisors (ZD's), like
the "monsters" of analysis before Mandelbrot tamed them into fractals, have been largely
avoided as pathological by number theorists. In the last handful of years, however, there
has been a shift (largely driven by the needs of physics) toward taking them more seri-
ously. Guillermo Moreno, in 1997, pushed Lie algebraic tactics to the limit of their use-
fulness and discerned that the ZD's in the 16-D extension, by Cayley-Dickson process, of
the Octonions, conform to a pattern homomorphic to the Octonion's automorphism group
(and the derivation group of all higher 2n -ions from their 2n-1 -ion precursors), G2 .1 His
approach, however, was that of an "armchair theorist," in that only a single instance of an
actual pair of mutually zero-dividing numbers in the Sedenions was given. K. and Mari
Imaeda, meanwhile, focused on manipulating arbitrary (hence complicated) Sedenion ex-
pressions, uncovering the ZD's within them, eliciting their general function theory, etc.2
          Simultaneous with the Imaedas' "top-down" tactics, R. de Marrais took a comple-
mentary "bottom-up" approach, isolating underlying structures from which all complicat-
ed ZD expressions and spaces in the Sedenions must be composed - structures which "fly
under the radar" of classical techniques, requiring an initial calculation-heavy "dirtying of
hands" to be elicited and studied.3 A set of 3 simple "production rules" - and one even
simpler generic procedure - were found to suffice for creation of all basic patterns. All
points on the pairs of diagonal line elements of 3<U+00BD> dozen planes (dubbed the "42 Asses-
sors") in Sedenion space mutually zero-divide all other such points on certain other such
diagonals. Using the familiar convention of "XOR indexing" (the index of the unit of
each of the 15 imaginary axes would equal the XOR of the indices of any 2 units whose
product was equal to it), any combination of a pure Octonion (index < 8), and a pure Se-
denion (index > 8) which was not the XOR of the Octonion with 8, yielded one of 7 x 6
= 42 possible axis-pairs to span Assessor planes.
          Representing each such plane by a unique vertex, on one of 7 isomorphic octahed-
ral lattices, resulted in a set of "box-kites" whose 8 triangular faces represented either 4
"sails" sharing vertices with each other but no edges, or 4 empty "vents" in the remaining
4 faces. Tracing an edge along a "sail" connected two mutually zero-dividing diagonals
in different Assessors (with points on different diagonals belonging to the same Assessor
never zero-dividing each other). The orthogonal diagonals "/" and "\" of an Assessor's
"X," spanned, say, by imaginary axes iA and iB , would be shorthanded (A+B) and (A-B)
respectively, with the Assessor pair as such simply indicated as (A, B).
          The multiplication indicated by a box-kite edge would connect two mutually zero-
dividing numbers of either same ("/ /" or "\ \") or different ("/ \" or "\ /") orientation,
respectively indicated by a "+" or "- " drawn on the joining path. By continuing to trace
along a sail's edges, a sequence of mutually zero-dividing pairs (henceforth, "DMZ's,"
for dyads making zero) would be indicated. By tracing all edges of a sail twice over, in
the manner of a spinor's "double covering," all 6 diagonals (each making zero with one
each from the other two Assessors) would be involved in a single 6-cyclic sequence of
DMZ's, in one of two varieties: the 4 sails of any box-kite would partition into 1 "triple
zigzag" ("/ \ / \ / \": i.e., "- " signs on all edges; also the case for the opposite-face "vent")
and 3 "trefoils" ("/ / / \ \ \": i.e., "+"-signs on all but 1 edge), leading to a total of 6 edges
of each sign per box-kite. Other such patterns connecting DMZ sequences, both within
and between box-kites, were elicited, and rules were determined for constructing higher-
dimensional spaces, all of whose points would zero-divide those of other such spaces.



                                               Page 2
          One more simple property of box-kites must be indicated in this overview: each
of the 7 is uniquely associated with the one Octonion which does not appear among its 6
vertices. The vertex pairs on opposite ends of any of the 3 orthogonal "struts" stabilizing
the framework (like the wooden sticks of a "real-world" box-kite) do not form DMZ's -
and these are the only non-DMZ pairings in a box-kite. Moreover, the products of all 3
of these opposite pairs, depending on the "edge-signs" we might imagine on their struts,
display either a pair of the units of index 8 which, per Cayley-Dickson process, generate
the Sedenions from the Octonions; or, a pair whose index is the "missing Octonion" -
henceforth dubbed the given box-kite's "strut constant." And, as is easily checked, the
"inner XOR" of the Octonion and Sedenion pairs defining the Assessors at each box-kite
vertex will always equal '8' plus this strut constant.
         In the table below, the strut constant for each box-kite is listed in the first cell of
each row, with each vertex's Assessor index-pair listed in the 6 columns that follow. The
Octonion indices of the vertices A, B, C are in bold-face: their Assessors form a box-
kite's sole triple-zigzag (orange in the diagram, with trefoils red, blue, green). They also
form an associative triplet, in "NATO" format (for natural ascending triplet order, mean-
ing written so that AB = +C, BC = +A, CA = +B). In fact, each sail's Octonions, read
aright, form NATO triplets, viz.: A, D, E; F, D, B; and F, C, E. (Conversely, the 4 trip-
lets contained in any set of 6 Octonions each imply a sail in the box-kite whose strut
constant is the 7th.) Note, too, that in each plane spanned by 2 of the 3 orthogonal strut
pairs (A, F; B, E; C,D), a circuit of its square frame yields a sequence of 4 DMZ's; but,
due to the alternation of signs on the edges, it takes two such non-intersecting trips, each
linking with a different diagonal in each Assessor, to tour all the square's 8 ZD's.

          Before offering more pictures and describing further properties, let's consider just
how peculiar (and hence, perhaps useful) the results just described truly are. Specifically,
let's see how radically they differ from the only zero-dividing entities familiar (indeed,
indispensable) in fundamental physics. Though their couching in operator or Clifford
algebra formalism may hide their ultimate nature as number types from casual view, the
"projection" operators of quantum mechanics are, in fact, hybrid units in a toroidal
number space. (Imaginary, Quaternion, Octonion, and higher 2n -ion units, by contrast,
run through their paces in 2-, 4-, 8-, and 2n - dimensional spherical spaces.)
         The simplest such number-form torus is just the Cartesian product of two imagi-
nary orbits: the study of the 4-D result of two 2-D spaces containing the unit circles of
the Argand diagram. The Italian geometer Corrado Segr<U+00E8> first studied these "bicomplex"
numbers in the 1890's4 ; G. Baley Price wrote the first full-length text studying them as
such, and in depth, only in the 1990's.5 (They also are implicit in Roger Penrose's well-
known "twistor" formalism6 , and were the starting point of Charles Mus<U+00E8>s' less well-
known "hypernumber" program.7 ) Segr<U+00E8> noted the 4 axes defining their context were
generated by 2 imaginary units, the real unit, and a fourth "mirror number" whose unit
was a square root of +1 but not itself equal to +1. This last is well-known in its own
right: a space-spanning system of 3 such, mutually noncommuting in the manner of the
Quaternions from which one can derive them, are commonly called the "Pauli spin-matri-
ces." And as Mus<U+00E8>s' work (and the detail-work of the 8-D Clifford algebra Cl3 8 ) under-
scores, a "normal" imaginary (or quaternion) unit doesn't commute with any such "mir-
ror units" - but Segr<U+00E8>'s second imaginary (represented by the 2 x 2 identity matrix, but
with the usual i replacing each real unit on the main diagonal) commutes with both sorts.
         If we call the mirror unit m, the two diagonals in the (1,m) plane each have a
point which is idempotent: [<U+00BD>(1+m)]2 = <U+00BC> (1 + 2m + 1) = <U+00BD> (1+m); moreover, the
bracketed quantities, raised to arbitrary powers, remain unchanged, allowing for expo-
nential and other functions to be defined along the diagonals which have these points as
their "units" in a manner isomorphic to the workings of the real number line. These
points also have two other properties of note: 1) they are the centers of mutually orthogo-
nal Argand-diagram-like "power orbit" circles, with diameters extending from +m to +1,
allowing them to provide a second "S1 x S1" representation of the generation of the torus
containing them; and, 2) the product of these mutually orthogonal idempotents, as is
readily checked, is zero - making them nilpotent as well. In this latter aspect, they are
easily recognized as the number-form basis for "projection" operators.
         Such toroidal numbers, far from being "artificial," are forced upon us by nature's
penchant for balanced bookkeeping: they're what you get when you contemplate the
phase curves defined by linear equations with purely imaginary eigenvalues (e.g., in the
theory of oscillations of conservative systems). But perhaps it's artificial to consider
such projections into the Quantum Void as necessarily built up from such zero-divisor
dyads. Perhaps this restriction has something to do with the scandal of the universe's
"90% missing mass"? Spherical number forms, beginning with the Sedenions, have ZD's
on diagonals, too - but they're never idempotents, have no real components, obey a ter-
nary not binary logic, and those composed from the same units will never (as opposed to
always) form DMZ's. The difference between these two approaches is as radical as that
between the renormalization tactics used in plus-or-minus-charged, photon-gauged,
electromagnetism, and the three-color "strong force" of quarks and gluons.



                                              Page 4
           Among other possibilities, this just indicated difference has a bearing on how one
interprets the well-known "zero-point fluctuations" (ZPF) of the vacuum - as manifest in
the experimentally well-attested "Casimir force," which allows actual extraction of ener-
gy (admittedly in minuscule quantities!) from the Void. And this, in turn, soon involves
one in foundation questions concerning the interrelations of the quantum and general
relativistic realms. Standard quantum field theory represents ZPF via standard creation
and annihilation operators acting on the vacuum; and, as part of the same gesture, gravity
is treated as an exchange of so-called "gravitons" in flat [sic] spacetime.
          Alternative approaches are numerous; we note but two, which point back indepen-
dently to a 1968 "blue sky" piece by Andrei Sakharov9 . First is the deep investigation
initiated by Haisch, Rueda and Putoff,10 of a non-Machian, zero-point basis for inertia,
developed using the classical, Poynting-vector-based tools of stochastic electrodynamics.
In their view, mass can be seen as a way of characterizing the resistance due to the ZPF
(and general Quantum Vacuum) "molasses" that kicks in upon acceleration. (The asym-
metric distortion induced in the ZPF by accelerating bodies was demonstrated, as they
note, by Davies and Unruh in the mid-'70s, building on Hawking's "black-hole evapora-
tion" model.) They hypothesize that rest mass would similarly be associated with the
fundamental "restlessness" of a particle (Schr<U+00F6>dinger's "zwitterbewegung"), attaining to
resonance at the Compton frequency, thereby finding the origin of de Broglie's "matter
waves" in Doppler shifts of the ZPF spectrum. They further suggest expanding their
approach to peel back, in a manner first suggested by Sakharov, the formalism of general
relativity itself. Which segu<U+00E9>s into the second alternative approach.
          In a book-length investigation of Nonassociative Algebras in Physics, Jaak L<U+00F5>h-
mus, Eugene Paal and Leo Sorgsepp note two patterns they assume are interconnected.11
On the one hand, they observe that modern physics has built itself upon the recognition of
a sequence of "infobarriers" associated with ever less regular notions of number: with
relativity, imaginaries are associated with the restrictive causality of the light-cone; the
Heisenberg uncertainty relations depend upon the Quaternions' noncommutativity; argu-
ments are made for such phenomena as "exact color symmetry" and its concomitant
quark confinement being side-effects of the Octonions' nonassociativity.
          On the other hand, they note that attempts to quantize gravity largely fail due to
the unique nature of the gravitational force: the analog of the "fine-structure constant" is
in fact a variable. Phenomena at the ultra-small scale of the Planck length require a sec-
ond kind of quantization - not of action, but of distance itself, leading to a notion of a
spacetime "crystalline" structure. But it is almost tautological that this latticework is
volatile: below the Planck length, it decays, and "multiplicands" are somehow "elastic."
          Putting these two threads together, it seems hardly outrageous to suggest that
Sakharov's "metrical elasticity" underwriting gravity is directly connected to the next
breakdown of properties - the loss of a field-theoretic notion of norm by which ZD's are
spawned. Since all points of a ZD diagonal make DMZ's with any points of any other
suitably box-kite-connected ZD, can we not say a study focused on the "pre-metric" lat-
ticework of ZD's, in the Sedenions and beyond, provides the only logical way to explore
such phenomena - and, perhaps identically, the phenomenology of the "Creation press-
ure" leading up to the Big Bang? The connection, after all, of the Sedenions to the Dirac
equation, and hence quantum mechanics, is well known; and a link from the Sedenions'
ZD substrate to general relativity can also be strongly suggested, thanks to box-kites.



                                             Page 5
           The following diagram of a box-kite doesn't have signed edges, and has peculiar
symbols on its vertices, and its "sails" lack coloring; it is otherwise, however, indistin-
guishable from that provided above. This was hardly the intent of its creator, though: for
it is an aid in visualizing a key proof concerning the symmetries of the curvature tensor
in John Milnor's classic lecture notes on Morse Theory.12 Using the notation of affine
connections, Milnor states in a lemma that a Riemannian manifold's curvature tensor sat-
isfies four relations: (1) it is skew-symmetric (R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,X)Z = 0); (2) cyclically
ordered such triples of vector fields sum to zero (R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,Z)X + R(Z,X)Y = 0);
(3) bracket relations are skew-symmetric (<R(X,Y)Z,W> + <R(X,Y)W,Z> = 0) in outer
symbols, but (4) unchanged when inner and outer symbols are exchanged (<R(X,Y)Z,W>
= <R(Z,W)X,Y>). The fourth property is the most difficult, its proof requiring use of the
other three - and leading to the diagram as an aid to its following. Says Milnor:

        Formula (2) asserts that the sum of the quantities at the vertices of shaded
        triangle W is zero. Similarly (making use of (1) and (3)) the sum of the
        vertices of each of the other shaded triangles is zero. Adding these
        identities for the top two shaded triangles, and subtracting the identities for
        the bottom ones, this means that twice the top vertex minus twice the
        bottom vertex is zero. This proves (4), and completes the proof.




         With Sedenion-based box-kites, of course, the shaded triangles comprise the sails,
and the products along each of their edges are zero; the terms at opposed ends of struts,
meanwhile, obey a different relation from those connected to each other in a sail - not
their sums, but their differences, must be attended to. Can a small number of "symmetry
breaks" and/or "categorical removes" serve to link these radically different uses of the
box-kite diagram? The question is a deep one, and will be treated in follow-up studies.
For now, consider that: (1) tensor notation replaced the now largely extinct approach of
Dyads and Nonions; (2) J. J. Sylvester's Nonions focused on a number notion he thought,
from the vantage of determinant theory, exactly analogous to Quaternions, but involving
cube roots of +1 rather than square roots of -1, entailing 3 x 3 arrays of monomials asso-
ciated with 3 x 3 matrix representatives whose non-zero entries were 1's and imaginary
cube roots of unity13 ; (3) the monomials are precisely those which "Siersma's Trick" in
Catastrophe Theory displays for the Double Cusp14 ; (4) ZPF "drag force" is a third order
effect; and (5) while un-normed Sedenions do not obey an "n-squares law" like the Ima-
ginaries' (2, 2, 2), they permit, among other relations of interest, a (9, 16, 16) variant.15


                                             Page 6
           Only the general context of that fifth and last consideration will be dealt with
herein. For, properly appreciated, it suggests a "metalevel" from which to view quantum
phenomena comparable to that provided for viewing general relativity and the relation of
mass to inertia in the above discussion. The problem of "n-squares laws" generalizes the
Pythagorean theorem and its application to higher-dimensional analogs of distance: the
(2, 2, 2) rule for Imaginaries merely says, firstly, that any Imaginary can be construed as
a point on a circle, hence at a distance of a "radius" from the origin, so that the radius'
square is the sum of the squares of the abscissa and ordinate values of the same point;
and, secondly, that the product of two such points can itself be understood the same way.
          More elaborate extensions of the same Pythagorean logic lead to the (4, 4, 4) rule
for Quaternions (the product of one sum of four squares times another is yet another sum
of four squares), and, more elaborate still, to the (8, 8, 8) rule for Octonions. Hurwitz's
classic proof, though, of the breakdown of the norm (and hence field structure) beyond 8
dimensions, means that Sedenions are most readily assimilated to a (16, 16, 32) rule:
since any Sedenion can be partitioned into two sets of 8 coordinates A and B, the product
of two can be written (A+B) <U+00B7> (A'+B') = AA' + AB' + BA' + BB' = 4 x 8 = 32 dimen-
sions required. And as Cayley's friend, the Rev. T. Kirkman, showed more than a centu-
ry and a half ago, products of three or more Sedenions actually require a backdrop of 64
dimensions!16 All of which suggests that the indefinite cascades of virtual particles,
handled by renormalization methods, may perhaps signify something else entirely, but
"seen through a glass darkly": viz., the 8D-chunked (or, "going toroidal" in E8 x E8
superstring style, 8D + 8D-chunked) side effect of a "Bizarro World" mutation of Hilbert
space thinking, where a proliferation of ever more multiply connected ZD-nets of 2n -ions,
n approaching infinity, provides (at least the "cover story" for) the "hidden agenda."
          We will return to the general architectural issues implied here at the end of this
monograph, when we consider the Artificial-Life- or neural-net- like simulation-work
suggested by such blue-sky "Creation Pressure" thematics. What is clear here, though, is
that even broaching such topics makes adherence to the tried and true (and badly aging)
Lie algebraic toolkit seem (if not exactly laughable) inadequate. The best way to make
this patently obvious is to thoroughly and concretely investigate the realities being only
vaguely indicated by the highly useful (but clearly limited) "G2 " results of Moreno. In
later work than that cited earlier, he determines that the automorphism group of the ZD's
of all 2n -ions derived from the Cayley-Dickson process, from the Sedenions on up, obey a
simple pattern: for n > 4, this group has the form G2 x (n-3) x S3 (this last being the stan-
dard order-6 permutation group on 3 elements).17
          This says the automorphism group of the Sedenions' ZD's has order 14 x 1 x 6 =
84: the number of diagonal line elements, all of whose points form DMZ's only with
other such line elements, contained in the 42 Assessors. Let's expand our horizons to the
32-D and 64-D cases and give them names (since they currently don't have any!). Fol-
lowing the convention adopted by Tony Smith, who has called the 28 -ions Voudons after
the 256 deities of the Ifa pantheon of Voodoo or Voudon, we'll call these Pathions (for
the "32 Paths" of Kabbalah) and Chingons (for the 64 Hexagrams of the I Ching or Book
of Changes). For completeness' sake, we name the 27 -ions too, dubbing them Routons,
after that legendary source of high-tech innovativeness, Route 128 of the "Massachusetts
Miracle" that paralleled Silicon Valley's on the "Left Coast" of this country. From Reals
to Voudons, then, we extend the standard shorthand thus: R, C, H, O, S, P, X, U, V.

 {1} Using "Table-Driven" Cayley-Dickson to Excavate the Kite-Chain Midden:
         What is meant by "table-driven": in the early days of the PC Revolution (the one
focused on computing, not "correctness"), dBase II allowed you to do easy database pro-
gramming, but largely confined you to handling data at the record level. When the next
wave of tools emerged, Paradox (the precursor of the networked, SQL-based juggernaut
that Oracle launched) let you use a simple logic of columnar links and commands to op-
erate on entire tables of data. In the transition phase between technologies, it was not
uncommon to take dBase programs that took an hour to run and replace them with Para-
dox routines that did the same job in under a minute. The moral of this story is: the way
the Cayley-Dickson process (henceforth, CDP) is typically presented (and, apparently,
used) is like dBase II. If we're to do anything interesting with ZD patterns in 2n -ions, n
large, we must follow the example of Paradox. (And, of course, we must also drop our
pencils at some not so far off point and write programs!) We will soon see that the
"table-driven" approach to the CDP is ridiculously easy to employ and explain.
         What the "Kite-Chain" (pronounced "kitchen") "Midden" is: the PC Revolution
was roughly contemporary with the spread of the "object-oriented programming," or
"OOP" paradigm. Its way of viewing things provides a handy (and deep-running) meta-
phor for thinking about zero divisors. Two key notions in OOP lore are design-hiding
and garbage-collecting (the latter conveniently built into the Java language). The first
embodies the precept that a maintainable and reusable design module will "privatize" key
variables, denying external users direct access to them. Beginning at least with "quark
confinement," Nature seems to make its innermost secrets likewise difficult of access.
However, Nature - from the panda's thumb to the microwave background radiation of the
cosmos - also does an imperfect job at covering up its tracks: pragmatic trade-offs being
what they are, allocation and deallocation of memory is never perfectly handled by any
"garbage collection" algorithm, in Nature or in software. Indeed, one way of looking at
archaeology (and in this sense, cosmologists studying the faint traces of the Big Bang's
aftershocks are engaged in it) is that this imperfection makes it possible.
         A midden, in Old English, comes from the word for "dung heap," and has come to
mean, to archaeologists, a specific thing: the heaps of broken dishes, worn-out cutlery,
sabre-tooth tiger bones, and other refuse tossed into deep recesses of inhabited caves or
other primitive dwelling sites over the millennia: such kitchen middens provide a trea-
sure trove of information on our ancestors' digestive tracts, sophistication of toolcraft,
and countless other matters that students of the past crave to (literally) unearth.
         Divisors of zero are likewise a "dung heap" of number-theory leavings which no
one's had much use for; yet it is possible to excavate their layers and find some surprising
patterns which extend indefinitely into remote reaches not of antiquity, but of "2n -ionity"
(which indeed might signify the ultimate antiquity of things leading up to and immediate-
ly out of the Big Bang anyway). The endless succession of layers in this "dig" takes the
form of a never-completed chain of box-kite-like entities, hence the "kite-chain" (said
"kitchen") qualifier on the "midden." With a table-driven CDP in hand, the intricacies of
the kite-chain midden will be easy to elicit. And once we've grasped their workings, the
patterns they reveal to us will make us doubt the generality of the "G2 " approach! (Espe-
cially when we see, in the section after this one, that as badly as Moreno's "upper bound"
is exceeded by the kite-chain midden, a slew of more elaborate ZD structures we'll call
"sand mandalas," first appearing in the Pathions, exceed such limits even more!)



                                             Page 8
           How the CDP works: like the route to Chaos we think the CDP resembles, there
is a "period-doubling" (here, doubling of dimension) which the CDP algorithm captures
by partitioning the numeric entities of its next level up in two parts: units whose indices
are contained in the starting-point 2n -ions go to the left of the comma, and those whose
indices range from 2n to 2n+1 -1, go to its right - but with 2n subtracted from them. The
complex numbers, to start (as the CDP does) with the simplest case, have n = 0, and are
inscribed (a,b), with a and b scalars multiplying the units i0 and i1 - reals and imaginaries.
          The product of two complex numbers, written (a,b) and (c,d), expands and recon-
tracts as follows: (ai0 + bi1 )(ci0 + di1 ) = (ac - bd)i0 + (ad + bc)i1 = (ac - bd, ad + bc).
CDP doubling yields the Quaternions, which obey much the same pattern. But since their
units don't commute, order matters. And since there's more than one imaginary unit to
deal with, indices must be made explicit, and so must the higher-dimensional analog of
complex conjugates. With simple imaginaries, the conjugate of C = (ai0 + bi) is just C* =
(ai0 - bi), so that C<U+00B7>C* = a2 + b2 ; for general Quaternion Q = (ai0 + bi1 + ci2 + di3 ), the
conjugate Q* is likewise (ai0 - bi1 - ci2 - di3 ), and Q<U+00B7>Q* = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 . In CDP
notation, we get (a + bi1, c + di1 ) and (a - bi1, -c -di1 ) respectively. For general 2n -ions,
the M and M* always have equal components, of opposite sign for non-real terms only.
          Here, we see that the i2 term (and, more generally, the term whose index is the
next-higher power of 2) acts as the generator of the new units appearing at the next level
(hence, has the same index - 0 - on the right of the comma that the real unit has on the
left); as such, a generator always produces same-signed resultants when applied on the
same side of an arbitrary unit among the 2n -ions it generates. Given that one can't index
even the Octonions so that all NATO triplets are also in counting order - (1, 7, 6) and
(3, 6, 5) are out of order in the usual XOR indexing scheme, for instance - this implies
that no imaginary unit except the generator will always produce a same-signed resultant
with arbitrary other units multiplied from the same side. This special feature of genera-
tors has far from trivial ramifications with higher 2n -ions, as we'll see soon enough.
          We need note one more general feature before giving the standard iterative CDP
algorithm, for it's more general than we need. We can generate higher-order systems of
mirror, imaginary, or "dual" numbers (which square to 0), by setting a parameter to +1 or
- 1 or 0 respectively, and create mixes of such systems by varying the parameter at each
successive CDP iteration. (One can even set the last of 4 parameters to a radical, to em-
bed the Sedenions in an extension field which has no zero divisors at all. More generally
still, one can exploit the theory of so-called "Pfister forms" - or engage in category theo-
retics to similar effect - and define the CDP over polynomial fields, expunging zero-divi-
sors and tying 2n -ions to quantum groups in one fell swoop18 : such nifty tricks, however,
won't concern us.) For our purposes, all parameters will be -1's; for completeness, we
give the general expression, with the most recently iterated parameter written p:

                     X <U+00B7> Y = (A,B) <U+00B7> (C,D) = (AC + p(D*)B, B(C*) + DA)

        If the component parts are not complicated admixtures, but simple sets of non-0-
indexed imaginary units with unit coefficients, we can treat conjugation as just negation,
and write only indices and signs (M - N, instead a<U+00B7>iM + b*<U+00B7>iN). Which gives us this:

                         X <U+00B7> Y = (A,B) <U+00B7> (C,D) = (AC + DB, DA - BC )



                                               Page 9
         Before we go into "table-drive," let's make this real with a worked example.
Going back to the Box-Kite diagram and its associated table, let's take a random path
between vertices - BC, say, on the triple zigzag ABC. Now, let's pick a random strut
constant: 6, for instance. The table says B then equates to the Assessor (4,10), and C to
(7,9). The sign on the edge is minus, so let's flip a coin and pick the "+" diagonal to be
B, the "-" to be C: this means multiply (i4 + i10 ) by (i7 - i9 ). By the formula, we get:

                     (4, 2) <U+00B7> (7, -1) = ( [(4)(7) - (1)(2)], [- (1)(4) - (2)(7)] )

         Refer to the relevant "NATO triplets": (3, 4, 7); (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (2, 5, 7). The
CDP comma separates O's from S's, the latter generated from the former by the unit in-
dexed 23 = 8, so we get (3 - 3, -5 - (-5)) = (+i3 - i13 ) + (- i3 + i13 ). For "hard" parenthe-
ses, "pair creation from the Quantum Void" is suggested; for "soft," we just have 0.
         Note that 3 xor 13 = 6, the strut constant, as required. Furthermore, (3, 13) has
edge sign "-", so we can continue edge-multiplying and get further zeros in a DMZ 6-
cycle, and say that the Assessor (3, 13) at vertex A is "emanated" by Assessors (4, 10)
and (7, 9), with (4 + 10)<U+00B7>(3 - 13) = (3 - 13)<U+00B7>(7 + 9) = [pair creation or] 0, and so on.
         It's easy to find multiplication tables for the Octonions, and also easy to build one
for the Sedenions; no higher tables have been published that we know of, but we don't
need them. All we need do is realize that the table for 2n+1 -ions is comprised of 4 tables
of the same size as that for the 2n -ions, with the latter table constituting the upper left
quadrant of the larger ensemble, its row and column values running from 0 to 2n - 1.
Calling this quadrant "I," and continuing to designate the other 3 by successive Roman
numerals in clockwise order, we can fill in all values of each of these by a simple trans-
formation of the ensemble of 2n -ion values in I.
         Quadrant II: Row values same as I ; column values of nth column of II = those
for n column of I + 2n . Hence if product of row-unit r and column-unit c in I is written
     th

(r, 0)(c, 0) = (rc + 0, 0<U+00B7>r - 0<U+00B7>c) = rc = entry in cell (r, c), then cell (r, 2n + c) in II will be
(r, 0)(0, c) = (r<U+00B7>0 + c<U+00B7>0, c<U+00B7>r - 0) = (0, -rc) = -(2n + rc), with "special handling" for r or c
= 0 or r = c. In the last case, since any in 2 is negative unity, the cell entry will be the odd-
looking "-0" (short for -i0 = -1) in the long diagonal of I. The peculiar status of the gen-
erator - any smaller-indexed positive unit u multiplying it on the left yields the positively
signed unit whose index is 2n + u - means that the corresponding long diagonal in II will
show (- 2n ) for all entries save the first row's. Corollarily, all entries in the first row and
column will be positive, with content 2n greater than the corresponding cell in I.
         To simplify, collectively refer to the extension of the top row, the first new (2nth )
column, and the main diagonal of II the "trident"of II (with tridents in all quadrants de-
fined analogously). Then we can sum up this way: the index-values in cells (r, 2n +c) =
2n + (r, c); sign of cells (r, 2n +c) = same as for (r, c) if in trident, opposite otherwise.
         Quadrant III: by similar arguments, cell entries in trident of III are identical in
content to corresponding entries in trident of I, and same in sign except for the leftmost
(2nth ) column, where signs are reversed; for all other cells, (2n + r, 2n + c) = same in
content and opposite in sign as (r, c).
         Quadrant IV: for each entry (2n + r, c) content is identical to that in correspond-
ing cell (r, 2n + c) of II, with signs reversed in the trident (except for the extension of 0th
column), but the same everywhere else.



                                               Page 10
          Naturally, the best way to grasp the iterative workings of this process is to exam-
ine a concrete for-instance where it's been applied multiple times. On the next page, we
give the multiplication table for the Sedenions (the Pathions' 32 x 32 array won't fit), us-
ing a checkerboard scheme of shading alternate Quaternion-sized blocks of cell entries, to
make the iterative structure easier to parse visually. Beneath this table, we give a listing
of the (25 -1)(25 -2)/3! = 155 NATO triplets in the Pathions (which we'll be focused on
most), with the triplets first appearing in the Octonions and Sedenions broken out separ-
ately at the top of the listing. Beyond the Pathions, even a listing of triplets becomes un-
manageable, as there are (26 -1)(26 -2)/3! = 651 of them for the Chingons alone, so readers
interested in checking calculations involving them later in this argument will need to feed
Pathion triplets into the CDP formula (or write code!).
         One crucial matter the "table-driven" approach makes obvious: since no box-kite
vertices have "trident" entries, one gets box-kite "harmonics" simply by adding 16 (or 32,
or 48 ... ) to their indices. These entities are not "stand-alone," however: for o, o', o"
Octonions; S, S', S" Sedenions; n an integer; two "Assessor harmonics" with indices (o +
16n, S + 16n) and (o' + 16n, S' + 16n) will emanate some (o" [ = o xor o' = S xor S' ], S"
[ = o xor S' = S xor o' ] ) contained in the basic box-kite. Each of the 12 paths in such a
harmonic, then, will have its "sail" completed by the Assessor in the "base-line" box-kite
whose harmonic, by visual logic, "ought to" complete its sail, but doesn't.
         Stranger still, if we consider all 3 harmonics allowed when we double domains up
to the 64-D Chingons, not only will the base-line box-kite complete sails in each, but the
first harmonic will form an "overtone series" with the second and third: "sails," that is,
will have one "Assessor harmonic" from each! For example, if the base-line is the box-
kite with strut constant 3, its Assessor strut-pairs are (2, 9) and (1, 10), (5, 14) and (6, 13),
and (7, 12) and (4, 15) - the first-listed in these pairings forming the box-kite's triple-zig-
zag. The "Assessor harmonics" for n = 1, 2, 3 respectively are therefore, in same order:

     (18, 25) and (17, 26)            (21, 30) and (22, 29)             (23, 28) and (20, 31)
     (34, 41) and (33, 42)            (37, 46) and (38, 45)             (39, 44) and (36, 47)
     (50, 57) and (49, 58)            (53, 62) and (54, 61)             (55, 60) and (52, 63)

        "Sails" involving all 3 of these harmonics can be constructed in sets of four, each
set completed by one of the 6 Assessors in the first harmonic. For the lowest-index
instance, the four sails are these:

             (17, 26) - (36, 47) - (53, 62)             (17, 26) - (37, 47) - (52, 63)
             (17, 26) - (38, 45) - (55, 60)             (17, 26) - (39, 44) - (54, 61)

         If we only consider the first harmonic - all we get with just the Pathions - we
have a system of twice the number of ZD-diagonals in a base-line box-kite, all inter-
related in the manner just described. This fits quite nicely with Moreno's assessment of
the total count of "irreducible" zero-divisors we should have: per his formula, 25 -ions
should have (5-3) x 84 = 168 such entities. But clearly, the formula breaks down with
one more doubling: when the kite-chain midden is extended to 26 -ions, we get not 3 x
84, but 4 x 84 = 336 ZD-diagonals: the maximal symmetry of Felix Klein's famous
figure that Poincar<U+00E9> determined was a tessellation by triangles of the hyperbolic plane.19

 {2} The Pathions' "Sand Mandalas" (Surprises in Symmetry and Degeneracy): In
the listing of triplets just given, those none of whose 3 pairings can act as Assessors (i.e.,
contribute ZD's) are rendered in italics. These include all the Octonions, all Sedenions
with an '8,' and all Pathions with a '16.' And, just as each of the 7 x 3 "8-less" Sedenion
triplets of form (O, S, S') produced two Assessor index-pairs - (O, S) and (O, S') - mak-
ing 42 in all, so the Pathions have 15 x 7 = 105 "16-less" triplets of form (O or S, P, P'),
and which yield 210 "Assessors" organized in 15 ensembles which are the Pathion equi-
valent of Box-Kites. In addition, as implied in the above discussion of kite-chain mid-
dens, 42 of the (P, P') pairings are ZD's as well, which makes 252 x 2 diagonals in each
= 504 "irreducible" ZD's specific to the Pathions. Add in the 84 first showing in the Se-
denions, and we have 588 in all: 3<U+00BD> times the count Moreno's formula would allow.
          The 15 Pathion ensembles of Assessors have many features we've already seen in
box-kites: Assessors at all 14 vertices of the analogous lattice have the same inner xor,
its value - one of 15 possible (O or) S indices - acting as the ensemble's signature. This
signature plays the role of "strut constant" as well, so that the Assessors at the 14 vertices
are arrayed in opposing pairs which do not form DMZ's, since their products include
non-canceling pairs of strut-constant-indexed and index-16 imaginaries. And, as with
box-kites, not just the (here, index- 16 instead of 8) generator, but the Assessor whose
Pathion is the xor of the strut constant with it, is also excluded from the lattice.
          While this much is easy to see, visualizing the connectedness of these ensembles
is hard: with each having 14 vertices, possibly forming DMZ's with all but 1 of the
others, we have 84 edges, forming (14 x 12)/3! = 28 "sails," divvied out among 7 Box-
Kites, each of which shares each of its 3 strut with 2 of the others. We say "possibly
forming" advisedly: one of the most surprising features of these ensembles - and why, as
we'll see, we call them "sand mandalas" - is that the full count of 168 DMZ's is only ob-
tained when the strut constant is 8 or less. And, when it is precisely 8, we get a peculiar
phenomenon we'll call "edge polarization." To grasp these things, however, a different
sort of visualizing strategy is called for. In a partial generalization of the table appended
to the box-kite diagram toward the start of this paper, we'll display the behaviors of the
sand mandalas in 14 x 14 spreadsheet-like layouts we'll call emanation tables.
          As with the column headings there, indices will be arranged to best satisfy two
sometimes conflicting constraints. First, Assessors on opposite ends of a strut are given
symmetrically opposite placement, so that indices have "nested parentheses" ordering
(just as columns A and F, B and E, and C and D formed strut-opposed pairings in the
earlier table). Second, when this first constraint allows (as it does for the first half of the
column heads for all sand mandalas with strut constants of 8 or greater), the lower-
indexed Assessors from all strut-pairs should have their O or S terms placed atop the
columns in ascending left-to-right order (and top-to-bottom order on the rows).
          When arranged in this manner, all cells of both long diagonals of the table will
always be empty: those running from the upper left toward the bottom right represent
products of an Assessor's diagonals with themselves, and these can never form DMZ's;
those running downward from the upper right, meanwhile, represent products of "strut
opposites," and these will always contain pairs of index-16 and strut-constant-indexed
imaginaries. The remaining 142 - (2 x 14) = 168 cell entries are assumed, by convention,
to be the O or S indices of the ZD "emanated" by multiplying the row-head's Assessor
times the column-head's, with appropriate edge-sign prefixing the entry.



                                             Page 13
         We'll construct the first "emanation table," for strut constant = 1, now. All the
Assessors have inner xor 17, units indexed 1 and 16 are excluded, and "nested parenthe-
ses" plus left-right (top-bottom) ordering give us the Sedenions listed in the first line as
column and row headings, associated with the Pathions of index > 16 listed below them:

         Note that all 168 available cell-entries are filled with emanations: save for the
diagonals, all row-listed ZD's form DMZ's with all column-listed ZD's. As a harbinger
of things to come, however, the eighth such table (strut constant indexing the Sedenions'
generator) shows a peculiar alignment: in each quadrant, all edge-signs are identical. In
upper left and lower right, they're negative, and positive otherwise. As is readily shown
by writing products in CDP form and recalling that all inner xor's will equal 16 + 8, this
is a side-effect of the peculiar characteristic of generators mentioned earlier: namely, all
their products with lower-indexed units, if taken on the same side, have the same sign.
         More subtle, and far more surprising, is an effect ultimately attributable to the
same root cause, but by a less transparent route: when the strut constant gets bigger than
the generator's index, only 72 of the available cell-entries contain emanations. Even
more mysterious, if we subtract 8 from the strut constant and call this the "excess," then
48 of these cell entries saturate the rows and columns at a distance of the excess from the
outer boundary: hence, for strut constant 9, all the outermost cells save for the 4 corners
are filled, and for 15, a cross of central rows and columns (minus the central square the
diagonals make) is formed, with contents evenly divided among allowed row- and col-
umn- heading Sedenions, save for '8' and the excess. Instead, these excepted entries are
equally dispersed among the remaining 24 filled cells, with the edge-signs always nega-
tive for entries of index '8' (and always positive for index equal to the excess), and re-
stricted to the same quadrants as the '/' and '\' empty diagonals respectively.



                                                         Page 14
          Viewed in sequence, these tables suggest the patterns made by cellular automata;
seen individually, they suggest nothing so much as the short-shelf-life "sand mandalas"
of Tibetan Buddhist ritual, made by monks on large flat surfaces with colored sands or
powdered flowers, minerals, or even gemstones. To best convey this sensibility, all 7 of
the 72-entry tables (prefaced by the "edge-polarized" table generated by strut constant 8)
are arrayed in two rows of four each, to be scanned left to right, top row first. They have
also been color-coded: the void diagonals are left empty; the cells which "should" be
filled but are magically left content-free are painted gray; the 24 entries made of strut-
constant components are green; the 48 which contain all other allowed entries are ren-
dered in red. (Rendered originally in MS Word tables, the cell-entry contents are quite
readable at 200% zoom in their native application; they become muddy, however, and
hard to read, when zoomed in the PDF format they were ported to, for which we offer our
apologies. In one sense, though, this "bug" is a "feature": it demands you attend to the
overall patterning, which is obviously what matters most here!)




          We're not yet done with surprises: for just as Kite-Chain Middens indicate a way
in which low-level structure can be echoed higher up the endless 2n -ion ladder, the seven
72-cell sand mandalas show us the way to collapse from one level of form to that native
to a level lower down. If we fold any of their tables along their row and column mid-
lines, the red cells of the sand mandala in question will overlay precisely and only those
O's and S's which form the vertices of the Box-Kite whose strut constant is equal to the
"excess." The cells painted green, on the other hand, will adjoin the Sedenions' index-8
generators and the Box Kite's own strut constant in a trio of ensembles, one per strut - or,
said another way, one for each "forbidden" O-triplet containing the strut constant.
          We can imagine the Pathion units associated uniquely with each emanation-table
entry being "boiled off" by some reductive process, the possible nature of which must be
left for future contemplation. We can also, of course, imagine "Sand-Mandala-Chain
Middens," echoing their basic structure in a modulo-32 rhythm. And we can imagine
even richer possibilities with the 31 emanation tables associated with the Chingons . . .
"restless triplet" cyclings connecting all such systems . . . and so on.


                                            Page 15
         To reach an understanding of the happenings in higher reaches, a more formal
grasp of the simplicities underlying the surprises in the Pathions would stand us well. We
know that units indexed g = 2n - hence, any generators of the next (2n -1) units via CDP -
operate in a uniquely uniform way. For all units iu , u < g, iu <U+00B7> ig = + i(u+g) . In the upper
left ("NW") quadrant of the emanation table, meanwhile, all row and column index-pairs
can be written (r, R) and (c, C) respectively, where lower-case indices all are O's, and
upper-case are P's (all > 16). Specifically, for all 72-celled sand mandalas, each Asses-
sor's inner xor ("ix") = 24 + <U+039E> , where <U+039E> ("xi") is the "excess" in the range of 1 to 7.
        But 24 is the sum of the first two generators which yield ZD behavior. Multiplied
with O's, the combined effect of the unilateral signing behavior of each taken separately
is reversed: i24 <U+00B7> iu = + i(24+u) . Further, if iu <U+00B7> iv = + iw makes an O triplet, i(24 + u) <U+00B7> i(24 + v) =
+ iw also. (By CDP, we get (- i(8 + u) <U+00B7> i(8 + v) ); this gives + iw by the "Quadrant III" rule
applied to generation of S's from O's.) Hence, for all u = r or c in the NW box, the term-
by-term signing of the two pairs of units in the product (r, 24 + r*) <U+00B7> (c, 24 + c*) will be
the same as for (r, r*) <U+00B7> (c, c*). But this latter just involves O's, and so lacks the sign-
canceling among like-indexed terms DMZ's require - and so, therefore, must the former!
        The only way around this null result is for one of the indices of R, C, or R xor C
to be precisely 24, with corresponding index r, c, or r xor c precisely the excess <U+039E> . Say r
= <U+039E> , left-multiply (c, C) by (r, R), and leave a sign-variable sg(..) = <U+00B1> (..) undetermined:

         (<U+039E> , 24) <U+00B7> (c, 24 + c*), where c <U+00B7> c* = sg( <U+039E> ), and hence <U+039E> <U+00B7> c = sg( c* )

         Left-multiplying by <U+039E> , then 24, we get these indices in successive output lines:

         <U+039E> <U+00B7> c <U+00E0> sg( c* ),          <U+039E> <U+00B7> (24 + c*) <U+00E0> 24 + (<U+039E> <U+00B7> c*) = ( - sg(24 + c) )
         24 <U+00B7> c <U+00E0> (24 + c),         24 <U+00B7> (24 + c*) <U+00E0> (- c* )

          Comparing cross-terms in the two lines, it's clear we have a zero product, with the
edge between (r, R) and (c, C) being signed the same as sg. Supposing c is <U+039E> instead
leads to the same result with a change of labels; slightly more work is called for if <U+039E> is in
the product instead of either multiplier. By symmetry, the same ZD criteria just demon-
strated can be appropriately interpreted in all quadrants. The 72-count (not just of non-
void cell entries, but of distinct DMZ pairings of ZD diagonals) follows trivially.
          That last parenthetical remark is a signal one: in Sedenion Box-Kites, the 12 ZD
diagonals in each, each belong to 2 Sails, making 24 DMZ's in all. In this, they conform
to the same formula we can generalize from the sand mandalas with <U+039E> > 0: for 2n -ions,
n>3, the ZD-pairings formula, up to Voudons, gives 6 <U+00B7> (2n-1 -4) = 24, 72, 168, 360, 744.
Alone in this series, the pairings for Pathions are a simple multiple of their predecessors'.
A little investigation shows us why: each of the 7 "excessive" sand mandalas can in fact
be partitioned into 3 Box-Kites, all sharing the same strut constant, but otherwise exactly
like those in the Sedenions - save for their each containing an "impossible" 8 as the low
index in one Assessor, forming a triple zigzag with two Assessors whose low-index terms
are an O and its xor with 8! So not only can we "fold over" its emanation table to get a
Sedenion Box-Kite; we can see it as housing 3 "harmonics" of it of a special kind. The
analogy to the Hyperbolic vs. Elliptic Umbilic Catastrophes' 1 to 3 Cusps, vis <U+00E0> vis 1
triple-zigzag to 3 trefoil Sails, was explored in our prior paper. How deep does it go?


                                                 Page 16
           In Catastrophe Theory, the D4 singularity takes on two forms when projected
from the complex to the real domains, and these are the two Umbilics just named. More,
it is also well-known, thanks to the "A-D-E Problem,"20 that the D4 pattern relates to
close-packing in 4-D, yielding the "Feynman checkerboard" of 24 unit hyperspheres in
each other's immediate proximity (the same pattern giving the 24-element group of
integer Quaternions). The Hyperbolic Umbilic, meanwhile, has its 2-D "behavior plane"
- when its definitive control variable is zero - degenerate into the 4-to-1 collapsing of
quadrants topologists call "folding the handkerchief." The similarity of this process to
the "folding over" of emanation tables - plus the special significance of 24 here - seems
hardly accidental. (And 72, for what it's worth, is the "closest-packing number" associ-
ated with the singularity E6 - the basis of the mysterious "trance tunnel" geometry stu-
died by James Callahan in a series of seminal papers modeling emotional affect re-
sponse.21 ) How might these patterns echo in higher number forms? We have not, for
instance, considered the "pathologies" awaiting in higher 2n -ions, when not 2, but 3 or
more such "hypernumbers" are multiplied. (Will we need, perhaps, to contemplate "ema-
nation solids"? And does the fact that both the Sedenions' 24 and the Pathions' 72 are
contained as simple factors of the Routons' "Babylonian" 360 mean anything special? In
this domain, so little is known, and so much computation will be required to learn more,
that we can truly deem this brand of mathematics an "experimental" discipline.)
          Let's wind down with something more concrete to mull on: the emanation table
shown as the last on the right of the top row in the prior illustration (with <U+039E> = 3) will be
exemplified. Its "green cell" units of 3 and 8 indicate a "folding over" into the Sedenion
Box-Kite with strut constant 3; the low-end indices shown in the emanation table do in-
deed "fold over" in the manner described above so that strut-opposed terms form Sedeni-
on Assessors (2, 9), (1, 10), (7, 12), (6, 13), (5,14), (4,15) as required. Meanwhile, if you
check the first table presented in this paper to corroborate that statement, you'll recall the
format of presentation (Assessors A, B, C forming a triple-zigzag, etc.). That format can
be retrieved (sans the now-redundant strut constant in the left-most column) to present
the 3 "impossible" Box-Kites the emanation table in question partitions into (each of
whose triple-zigzags' bolded lower-index terms form hard-working, Box-Kite-sustaining
"mule-trains" of "sterile" triplets which can never form ZD's in their own right). This
emanation table partitions into 3 Box-Kites with strut constant 11 as follows:

                           A      B       C       D       E        F .

                        1, 26   8, 19    9, 18   2, 25   3, 24   10, 17

                        4, 31   8, 19   12, 23   7, 28   3, 24   15, 20

                        6, 29   8, 19   14, 21   5, 30   3, 24   13, 22

        Note that the common appearance of the (8, 19) and (3, 24) Assessors in each of
these 3 Box-Kites would seem to belie the assertion that they partition the 72 DMZ cells
cleanly: but this shared pair of Assessors are strut-opposites, and we are now viewing
these Box-Kites not as collections of 12 ZD diagonals, but of 24 DMZ-pairings; so, as
such, there's no sharing of any terms between them! From all we've seen of the Pathions
and their patterns of emanation, this distinction, while subtle, is obviously a crucial one.



                                              Page 17
           But this suggests the 7 interconnected Box-Kites of the 168-cell emanation tables
may be viewed in a similar manner, making their interconnectedness not hard to deal
with, but simple. Consider the first table's Assessor list given atop page 14: take the
lower-index items in the first of its two lines as given, and pick the leftmost value (2).
The two successive pairs that follow each complete a triple with it. Add in their 3 strut-
opposites on the right, and we've got the lower-index scheme for the first 3 Box-Kites:
(2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3); (2, 8, 10, 11, 9, 3); (2, 12, 14, 15, 13, 3). Now move right, pick the (4),
and form 2 new triples with it from the left of the line; including opposites from the right
gives 2 more Box-Kites: (4, 8, 12, 13, 9, 5); (4, 10, 14, 15, 11, 5). Shift again, pick the
(6), perform the same trick: (6, 8, 14, 15, 9, 7); (6, 10, 12, 13, 11, 7).
          Parting thought anent "Mule-Trains": the attentive reader may already have fig-
ured out that if each <U+039E> -high (henceforth, "Sky-High") emanation table splits into 3 Box-
Kites, each with 2 sails based on one of the 7 overworked "Mule-Train" triplets, 7 x 3 x 2
= 42. The MT-Sails, then, play a role in Sky-Highs akin to the Sedenions' 42 Assessors
- or, perhaps more precisely, to the 42 inscriptions of the similarly "sterile" Octonions on
Box-Kite vertices therein. In this sense, each Sky-High's excluding but one Mule-Train
(the triplet completing the "green cell" pairings) is like the ban of the strut-constant Octo-
nions in the Sedenion context, which also act as "signatures." Is all this the beginning of
a "Jordan-Holder" sort of theory of lattice hierarchies in the ZD-Net? Tune in next
monograph, same text archive, same font of speculation, for the next exciting episode . . .

{3} Simulating "Creation Pressure" ( Cellular Automata Underneath Number?): In
the early days of neural networks, random Booleans operator values were strewn across
gate arrays, while researchers "watched what happened." Differently weighting different
levels of 2n -ions suggests itself, with further study of the harmonics and collapses, first in
evidence with the Pathions as just discussed, calling for a more programmatic approach.
The possibility of underwriting such a "ZD-net" with cellular-automata-like rules - and
hence, seeing Number itself as their side-effect in some deep senses - merits serious con-
sideration as well. Steve Wolfram's "Rule 30,"22 for instance - if a term and its right-
hand neighbor share a property, they switch its value to that held by the neighbor on their
left - might prove a good starting point in exploring "triplet-switch effects": for any As-
sessor, in any Sail, its lower-order (O, say) index will form a triplet with the other lower-
order indices in the same Sail; but it will also form a triplet with its adjacent Assessors'
higher-order (S or P, say) indices.
          Meanwhile, collapsing a Sky-High onto a Sedenion box-kite leaves all Assessors
properly indexed, but since the strut-opposite cell contents from which they were engen-
dered in the Pathions always have opposite edge-signs, their own edge-signs are left inde-
finite, and hence any interrupted cyclings may perhaps be left hanging (and vulnerable,
thereby, to "digression pressure") . . . at least for the moment of symmetry-breaking when
Pathions are "boiled off."
          Then too, kite-chain midden harmonics allow for ever greater "switching yard"
complexities as the n in 2n -ion gets bigger. What underlying restlessness of triplets, or
overarching "gantry-work" for growing n, might lead all these systems to "cross-pollin-
ate"? To what effect? By induction, and in conclusion, one can easily imagine things in
the general case getting wacky with alacrity. Where, then, one must wonder, might we
go with this?

    Moreno's formula is identical to that derived by Hurwitz in a superficially unrelated context: the
classification of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g > 2 have automorphism groups of size 84(g-1).
And, as the smallest order such group is a simple group, there is no Hurwitz group of order 84 - so the first
instance is analogous to the Pathion harmonic just described, while higher instances are no longer general!
(But indeed, even the Pathions' case isn't truly general either, as we'll see next section!) See Gareth A.
