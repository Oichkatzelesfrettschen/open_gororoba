## Key Content

### Box-Kite Group Structure

The 7 box-kites in the sedenions are organized by a group structure inherited
from the octonion multiplication rules. The "placeholder" substructures are
specific arrangements of assessor indices that reveal deep number-theoretic
connections.

### Connection to Simplicial Dynamics

The paper connects the combinatorial structure of box-kite vertices and edges
to simplicial dynamics, showing that the topology of the ZD interaction graph
has interpretable dynamical properties.

### Key Theorem

The 42 primitive assessors partition into exactly 7 isomorphic octahedral
structures (box-kites), each characterized by a unique "missing" octonion
index (the strut constant). This is a concrete realization of Moreno's
abstract G_2 homomorphism result.
