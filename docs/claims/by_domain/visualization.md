- Hypothesis C-412 (Modeled (Visualization), 2026-02-02): "Holographic Entropy Trap" 5-phase mechanism (Injection -> Lensing -> Sedenion Resonance -> Parton Decay -> Extraction) visualized in Director's Cut animation.
  - Where stated: `data/artifacts/images/warp_pulse_animation_directors_cut.mp4`, `src/scripts/visualization/animate_warp_v7_directors_cut.py`

- Hypothesis C-417 (Speculative (Synthesis), 2026-02-02): Hypothesis: Ray capture efficiency in fractal metamaterials correlates with Sedenion Zero Divisor density; "Holographic Entropy Trap" maps information loss to algebraic annihilation.
  - Where stated: `docs/external_sources/OPEN_CLAIMS_SOURCES.md`, `src/scripts/analysis/sedenion_warp_synthesis.py`, `data/artifacts/images/sedenion_capture_scaling.png`

- Hypothesis C-422 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-02): Negative-dimension vacuum dynamics ($D \sim k^{-3}$) coupled with attractive self-interaction spontaneously generates stable solitons (gravastar candidates) from random fluctuations.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/simulation/genesis_simulation_v2.py`, `data/artifacts/images/genesis_simulation_grand.png`

- Hypothesis C-423 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-02): Grand Unified Simulator v4 integrates CUDA-based relativistic ray tracing with robust FDFD electromagnetic field solving to visualize multi-scale warp-metamaterial interactions.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/engineering/grand_unified_simulator_v4.py`, `data/artifacts/images/OCULUS_GRAND_DASHBOARD_v4.png`

- Hypothesis C-424 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-02): "Holographic Warp Gate" simulation harmonizes Alcubierre metric gradients with Kozyrev p-adic noise and Spaceplate refractive index compression ($R \approx 5$) to model structured vacuum control.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/engineering/holographic_warp_gate.py`, `data/artifacts/images/holographic_warp_gpu.png`

- Hypothesis C-428 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-02): Integrated Warp Geodesic Simulation traces null rays through a Kerr metric background using 'NegDimCosmology' expansion parameters; escape/capture conditions are successfully visualized in a plot.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/simulation/integrated_warp_geodesic.py`, `data/artifacts/images/kerr_trace_demo.png`

- Hypothesis C-429 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-02): Kerr black hole shadow asymmetry due to frame dragging (a*=0.99) is successfully simulated and visualized; deviation from Schwarzschild shadow is consistent with spin effects.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/simulation/frame_dragging_demo.py`, `data/artifacts/images/kerr_shadow_asymmetry.png`

- Hypothesis C-430 (Modeled (Analytic), 2026-02-02): Negative Dimension Cosmology (NegDim) expansion history H(z) and luminosity distance D_L(z) deviate from standard LambdaCDM as predicted by the effective equation of state w_eff.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/analysis/cosmology_comparison.py`, `data/artifacts/images/cosmology_comparison.png`

- Hypothesis C-431 (Modeled (Visualization), 2026-02-02): The Sedenion Zero Divisor manifold, when projected into 3D perturbation space (e2, e5, e14), forms a coherent, non-trivial isosurface, visualizing the 'shadow' of the 16D algebraic singularity.
  - Where stated: `src/scripts/visualization/vis_8d_slice.py`, `data/artifacts/images/sedenion_slice_3d.png`

- Hypothesis C-432 (Partially verified (Ray-trace only; analytic overlay pending), 2026-02-02): Kerr geodesic trajectories computed via the C++ Mino-time integrator can be compared against the analytic Bardeen (1973) shadow boundary; an overlay check is pending.
  - Where stated: `docs/external_sources/OPEN_CLAIMS_SOURCES.md`, `src/scripts/simulation/integrated_warp_geodesic.py`, `data/artifacts/images/kerr_trace_demo.png`

- Hypothesis C-434 (Verified (Provenance), 2026-02-03): Material stack Silicon-Gold-Ice VIII reconciled with literature-supported optical constants (Si n=3.48, Au complex eps, Ice VIII n=1.73 @ 30 GPa) for 1550nm Analogue Optics experiments.
  - Where stated: `docs/theory/WARP_PHYSICS_RECONCILIATION.md`, `src/scripts/visualization/animate_warp_v8_rigorous.py`

- Hypothesis C-435 (Modeled (Simulation), 2026-02-03): "Power Pipeline" energy bookkeeping model (Photon intensity -> boundary absorption -> Plasmon field -> Parton jitter field) replaces stochastic state changes in Warp Ring simulations.
  - Where stated: `docs/theory/WARP_PHYSICS_RECONCILIATION.md`, `src/scripts/visualization/animate_warp_v8_rigorous.py`
