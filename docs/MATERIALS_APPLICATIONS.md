# Novel Connections: High-Dimensional Algebra in Condensed Matter

## 1. Topological Insulators & Octonions
**Findings**:
*   Topological Insulators (TIs) exhibit **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence** and **Spin-Momentum Locking**.
*   Standard TIs are described by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants (related to Complex K-theory).
*   **Novel Hypothesis**: The **Non-Associative** nature of Octonions might map to **Non-Abelian Anyons** in Fractional Quantum Hall Effects (FQHE). If Octonions describe the symmetry of the "Bulk", the "Boundary" might host states protected by $G_2$ symmetry (the automorphism group of Octonions).

## 2. Sedenions & "Zero-Divisor" Materials
**Findings**:
*   Sedenions (16D) contain **Zero Divisors** ($AB=0$ for $A,B 
eq 0$).
*   **Physical Interpretation**: A Zero Divisor represents a "Collapse" or "Destructive Interference" of information.
*   **Material Prediction**: A **"Sedenionic Metamaterial"** where signal propagation depends on the *order* of operations (Non-Associativity) and certain wave combinations vanish completely (Zero Divisors). This could lead to perfect **Signal Filtering** or **One-Way Mirroring** (Non-Reciprocity) without magnetic fields.

## 3. Quasicrystals & E8
**Findings**:
*   Quasicrystals (e.g., Penrose tiles) are projections of higher-dimensional lattices (like E8) onto 3D space.
*   **Application**: The "E8-Inspired" data in this repo could be interpreted as the **Diffraction Pattern** of a 8D quasicrystal projected down to 4D (Spacetime).

## 4. Proposed Experiment: The "Non-Associative Circuit"
*   Construct a circuit network where nodes multiply signals according to the Cayley-Dickson rules.
*   *Observation*: In a Sedenion-based circuit, $(A \cdot B) \cdot C$ would output a different voltage than $A \cdot (B \cdot C)$.
*   *Utility*: Logic gates that depend on "history" or "grouping" of inputs, useful for neuromorphic computing.
